<p>社評</p>
<h3>論緬甸戰局</h3>
<p>日本南方派遣軍中島報這部長於本月二十七日就大東亞戰爭最近發展情況，明白斷言：「反軸心軍擬奪回緬甸，但為日本先制的攻勢所破」。這是目前緬甸戰局最簡單的說明。</p>
<p>緬甸在東亞戰爭中的地位之重要，早爲各方面所共認。它的重要性，是與戰爭雙方之軍事，政治，經濟三者不能分裂的。從軍事上說，緬甸處於大東亞戰傷的最西端，介終印度，重慶和南洋之間，對於作戰雙方，具有舉足輕重的作用。假如反軸心軍能夠控制緬甸，則第一，向東北為省，且可使此諸省之兵力移調至粵，湘，贑，鄴，乃至陝豫等地，不必分割苦守於西南窮疆了。第二，向東南兩方可以北控越泰心腹，南拊馬來之背，從空陸雙方，以與西南太平洋之海軍互相策應，以進窺南洋羣島。反之，如日軍能鞏固緬鰓之佔領，則局面完全不同，不僅可以掩護日軍甫方開發及動員工作，且可以確保對印攻勢的有利態勢，反軸心軍所謂「太平洋反玫作戰」將永難實現。</p>
<p>軍事上緬甸所處重要地位，固如上述，而政治上與經濟上的意義，尤不容輕忽。從政治上的意義言，緬甸為渝印政治聯擊之紐帶，亦即是英美由大陸控制中國西南的前衛陣地。所以緬甸一旦失去獨立而為英美所控制，則我國西南門戶洞開，將一任英美之予取予求，故中國亦不能完全擺脫殖民地地位而實現獨立完整。反之緬甸如能真正獨立，則不僅可為我國西南之屏藩，且足以振奮印度民族獨立戰鬥之情緒，而終將結束英美制霸東亞之命運。</p>
<p>更從經濟上的意義言，緬甸為印度之烏克蘭，緬甸更為東亞之高加索！就前者說，是因為緬甸之米，向為印度民食所賴，今因緬甸巳與印度分劃出來，未及兩年，而東部印度糧荒之嚴重，竟使「印度之倫敦」的加爾各答，為餓莩所充溢，日前路透社亦不得不拍發人民因飢餓而發為獸行的電訊！就後者言，緬甸之石油生產對於印渝軍事經濟有重大意義，今日則反用以打擊印渝！同時，自八月一日緬甸宜布獨立建國並對英美宣戰以來，共一切資源動力乃至人力，決心為大東亞最後戰勝而貢獻，對反軸心國的打學之慘重，決非言語所能形容盡致！</p>
<p>反軸心國對於緬甸之局勢，自然感到非常痛苦的！不錯，英美在世界的戰略上正集注其心力於對付德國，但是他們在東方的帝國主義的霸權之沒落，內心之痛苦，實遠甚於對歐洲的關懷。因此，對於東亞的野心，－即是恢復在東亞之地位的野心，是永遠未曾忘懷的。特別對於緬甸，他們亟恩爭取爲的是：　不爭取緬甸，即不足以屏蔽印度：　不爭取緬甸，即不能充分　行援渝諾言，亦既不能支持重慶拖戰；　不爭取緬甸，即不能建立「太平洋反攻」作戰中反軸心軍在陸海空三者間的統一。然而如何爭取緬甸呢？由於地中海方面海軍尚未能移用到印度洋來，由於太平陽上海空軍在「一平方消耗一噸炸彈」的苦悶中，主要的就是靠印度和重慶的兵力，特別是後者，據最近的電訊，滇南怒江滇水方面集中的兵力在數量上極其龐大，同時，反軸心軍東南亞洲總司令在印度召開軍事會議之後，又有飛渝晤蔣的消息，對於緬甸作戰之處心積慮，彰彰明甚！</p>
<p>可是，緬甸獨立的支持者，乃地東亞民族的保護者日本軍事當局，對於反軸心方面這種野心與策動，是絲毫不會忽視的，相反的，他永遠不是處於挨打的防禦的地位，而是堅定地保持打擊者的態勢，在反軸心方面議論未決之時，首先發動了軍事和政治的攻勢。政治方面早在八月」日扶助緬甸實現獨立建國，接着又右協助菲島責現完全獨立及印度臨時政府之宣吿成立，在被壓迫的殖民地民族面前用事實來說明大束亞戰爭的意義，揭穿英美帝國主義者的眞面目，這種政治攻勢，是軍事上最大的協力，其力量之重大現在尚難估計。緊跟着政治攻熱之後，便是軍事的反學，兩星期來的怒江西岸及滇水作戰，可說巳經在基本上給「奪回緬甸計劃」以有力的打擊。即在美國方面，日來亦　此特別注意。二十七日中央社阿根廷京城電，即巳指出怒江方面渝軍瀕危情形，予美人以莫大刺激，美方巳承認日軍此次作戰目標，蓋在包圍怒江西岸之渝軍，加以澈底殲滅。現在淪方軍委會公報亦承認日軍精銳部隊，在怒江西岸作電擊猛攻，佔奪渡河點，有渡河而東之勢。當然，今日要就滇西滇南乃至整個緬甸西部的戰局作全面的評斷，尚非共時，但大局卻已相當明顯，我們已經可以說，反軸心軍「奪回緬甸」的口號喊了一年，恰如歐洲的「第二戰綫」一樣只是紙上談兵，現在反軸心軍的行動尚未開始，不僅已經受到政治上的鐵拳，而且又巳遭到軍事上的鋼鞭。英美自食其果，原無足道，重慶方面所爭的教訓難道還嫌不夠嗎？</p>
<h3>日臨時會議通過　大東亞總崛起案　東條首相闡明勝利之決心</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日第八十三屆臨時議會，昨上午舉行全體會議，討論大束亞總嵋起決議案。由金光庸夫氏說明提業趣旨後，滿傷一致予以通過。該案之內容如次，萬邦各得其所，兆民悉安其本，根據道義精神，世界新秩序者，乃日本肇國之大理想，並為大東亞之共同目的，今敵人英。美　霸東亞之非望，已被摧毀，大東亞建　日見　展，大東亞共榮圈內諸邦，基礎亦愈趨鞏固。緬甸·菲律資今已達其宿願，印度亦樹立臨時政府，行將掙脫英國多年之桎梏，致重慶亦巳失其抗戰　義，故東亞十億民族極應打成一片，共局奮鬥，擊滅共同仇人，永久群故東亞，以樹立世界怛久之相平。</p>

<h3>日議會定今日　舉行閉幕禮　昨大會通過全部耍案</h3>

<h3>怒江西岸一帶　日軍獲大戰果龍陵芒市渝軍被圍</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　據雲南前綫電，雲南方面自日陸軍各精銳部隊實行猛攻後，已於怒江西岸一帶，獲得莫大戰果。此作戰所予聯合軍方面之影響甚大，尤其渝方，由於日軍進攻極感恐怖。觀日軍之赫赫戰果，雙方損害特殊，渝軍棄屍千餘，而日軍僅陣亡數名。日軍掃蕩部隊，現於明光河·龍川河。及空查河地區，壓制渝軍第三十六師，寇乃擴大戰果中。淪軍因此已陷於窘境，乃企圖自北方向六庫方面遁走。然渡河點巳為日軍控制，復為高黎貢山脈之險峻所阻，彼等退路，已全被遮斷，顧屢有欲將器隱匿山中，企圖換着便衣逃走着。龍陵芒市平嘎方面淪軍，現突破日軍包圍圈，救援此等渝軍，終未得逞。渝方極力掩節以上事實，又恐日軍東進，乃自永平經灌瀾於六庫渡瀘水對岸，集結相當數之增援部隊，僅謂刻正與日軍激戰中。又反軸心國方面，承經淪軍戰敗，傳美軍事評論家鮑特溫，於紐約泰晤士報確認謂，緬甸公路方面已全被日軍掌握云云。現渝軍要求東印英軍救援，而該方面英軍仍持旁觀態度，愈暴露反軸心方面同床異夢之悄狀云。</p>
<p>高黎貢山仍有激戰</p>
<p>里斯本廿八日中央社電　據電慶電渝軍委會廿六日發表公報稱，滇緬通境高黎貢山一帶仍有激戰。</p>
<p>東京廿八日中央社電　據雲南前綫電，雲南方面一部渝軍，廿甘晨自某山逃出，企圖由高黎貫山山路遁往怒江東岸，然因退路已新，日福力部隊，更對之圍攻，經激戰後，所予第三十六師，第百零八團打擊甚大，是役會發視渝軍腎長楊運洪之屍體。據於是役鹵獲第三十六師百零八圑長之文件，巳確實證明，除第三十六師師長李志鴻外，其他如第三六師副師長，以及自衛軍司令朱振華，一零入圑圑長，一零六團團長等軍首腦部，均正彷徨於日軍包圍陣內。甘軍精鋭部隊，刻正壓縮包圍陣中。又日軍廿七日曾以飛機散放勸降傳單，據渝軍俘虜述稱，包圍網內之淪軍，因食糧缺乏，已失戰意，均希望投降。似此次怒江作戰，渝軍企圖已完全被挫，對被日軍包圍之軍隊。復無策援救，唯有任其東手待斃云。</p>
<h3>美機九架　襲海口未逞</h3>
<p>海口二十八日中央社電　敵　統一式B24型及北美B35轟炸機九架，曾於二十六日分四次，以三百米低空來嬰溫甫島海口方面，日海軍機隊興陸上部隊協力，當即應戰，擊落共三架，並擊毀其一架，將共擊退。日機亦麥失二架，其中一架係行撞敵機與敵偕亡者，此外並損失小聖船舶若干艘云。</p>

<h3>澳門通訊　舊事重提的　緬甸之戰</h3>
<p>我們當遼記得，羅斯福·邱吉爾在奎貝克會談中，所討論的主要議題之一·是爭取緬甸，其目的有二第一，重開緬甸路，以防止渝方因對英美失望而脫離反軸心陣錢。第二，想以渝方領城內的重要地點作根據地，空襲甘本本土。所以他們的日標，先欲奪問緬甸北部，衝過日軍嚴重警戒下的保山，騰題，密芝那，頓斯基耶的邊境。而着手建設連接印度的西北路綫。</p>
<p>奎目可會議的結果，任命蒙特巴頓為東南亞洲總司令官，飛赴新德里，召集奧慶萊克，史蒂威爾等討論今後的戰略。在四部緬印國境一帶，英印軍的佈置已告完成，空軍亦大見增强，向日軍綫虎视眈眈，枕戈待命。同时，在海軍方面，因地中漆戰事已告一段落，故一部分英國艦隊從大西洋。地中海方面抽調至印度洋·準備海陸同時發動。</p>
<p>英美爭統帥權</p>
<p>可是蒙特巴頓雖結合陸海空大軍準備爭取緬甸，但其內部意見分裂。蒙特巴頓輿美國的西南太平洋總司令官麥克沃塞，在作戰區域·統帥權限上，發生衝突·而術蔣及史蒂威爾亦不屑受共指揮。前綫如此，後方又何獨不然。美國海軍部長諾克斯，和英國內政部易莫理遜，在太平洋作戰問問上，在二方面的分担犧牲上，都想侵對方與他人作　蚌之爭，而自已坐享漁翁之利。這種企圖，充分暴露了他們的弱點。</p>
<p>然而儘管英美之問在統帥問題上有着權限之爭，有着人事的摩擦，大家都想迥避責任，議卸犧牲，可是爭取緬甸是他們所不得不積極進行的一種軍事行防。否則，渝方必將退出，而他們反攻東亞的態勢，也將根本無從整備了</p>
<p>緬甸的雨季過去了。英印軍，渝軍，打起「收復緬甸」的旗號，開始滾動。</p>
<p>緬甸的勘定戰</p>
<p>去年五月，日軍開始緬殿勘定戰，以破竹之勢進攻，在素稱峻險的雲南邊境，展開大睦決戰。那時，開始攻擊的日軍雲南進攻部隊，首先覆減金圖奪回緬甸而蠶動的渝蔣直系軍前進據點，越過三千米以上的險峻高山，一舉占領騰越，龍陵，拉孟等據點，徹底破　了重慶的輪血路——緬甸路棧。自此以後，渝軍郎繼續進行爭取漠緬路的游擊戰，而屢衆打擊。在本年二月的一戰中，中央直系軍預備第二師被日軍漬減。但至五月經英奐的嗾便，重作收復緬甸之夢，企圖奪佔重開滇緬路的前進最點，乘雨季把遠征軍總司令官陳誠處下的第三十六師（師長李志屬）開至怒江以四，牽領騰龍邊區自衛軍司令朱振重（第卅六師副司長兼）並邊區游擊隊司令謝普生，開始行動。重慶不惜處耗國家的元氣，為英國死守其所視為生命綫之緬印國境綫。而漠不自覺·其情實在可僯。</p>
<p>封鎖怒江的渡河點</p>
<p>日軍的雲南進攻部隊，於十月十五日開始進攻，當日卽占領渝軍根據地某地一帶，長驅突入冷水溝，扼守渝軍背面的狹路。十六日午後入時，攻佔某地，窮迫敗軍，於十七日正午，突入某地，封鎭怒江的渡河點，完全截斷敵的退路。第三十六師為中心的一萬五千餘渝軍，變成袋中之鼠，狠奔豕突·陷於日軍的包圍中。同時·某挺進隊橫斷稱為天下的險峻之高黎買山脈，十六日午後五時。占領黎實，于七甘午後二時，長驅突入怒扛的渡河點栗柴壩，而迂回怒江波河點西北某地的臼軍某部隊亦於十六日越過某高由而進出於某地，兩軍携手封閉了大包圍殲滅戰的袋口·在日軍南北挟擊的總攻中·渝軍無立足之地。據俘盧稱·揚言緬甸總反攻而陷於不可收拾的混亂中之三十師師長李志鵬，早巳捨槖部下，在栗柴橋附近逃走了。</p>
<p>在另一方面，渝軍聲稱增派遠征軍三十五萬至雲南，以增厚軍力，幷另派精稅五萬名用空輪方法送到束部印度，開赴印極國境的英美防綫。對於此方面的英渝軍，從密芝那出發的日軍某部隊，繞向左方並皆後。關始行動，進攻英渝軍正面，擊破其防綫，和進攻二十六師根據地的部隊相聯終，形成大包圍陣勢。</p>
<p>陷於日軍包圍中的地方，包括勝越及龍川河谷一帶的平原，乃農產豐穠之區弓而為渝方的兵站聶地。現正屆收獲之期，廣泛無垠的稻田中，一片金黃色的稻穗之浪渡動着。該區域的失陷，在渝方實是致命的打擊，且駐印渝軍的聯絡，亦因此而斷絕，英渝共同作戰的企圖，至此完全絕望了。（十月二十日航寄）</p>

<p>大東亞之建般，乃以大東亞共樂圈內各民族之自動協力為基礎。自日本言之，以平等互惠觀念，使各民族　成其所希望者乃基本施策，故必須打破過去阻碍平等互惠原則之國際關係，以互護敦睦為原則使東亞各民族協力互助。日本肇國之大精神，自非砍獨霸大東亞，乃全世界古今東四人士所尊崇之公道。中島氏之意見最當內容，政府富局現正考究具體有效之政策，且已實行萬全之措置。中島氏質問之點，乃關於臼本對大東亞戰爭之基本對外政策，蘇略述已見予以說明，此次大戰乃英·美所挑撥發動最大之帝國主義戰爭·英·美之政策在使世界大部化為彼等殖民地，彼等利用重慶爲其爪牙，叛謀東亞，並圖永久支配印度與萍列賓，彼等侵蝕東亞之冤手，於此次大戰中已伸入伊期，伊拉克·阿刺伯方面，且欲把握緬甸，進而企國恢復對中國及全束亞人之支配地位。美國之戰爭目的，乃以建設世界帝國之野望為出發點，更力謀據張其於南北復其菲島之勢力，使成為制壓東亞之根據化於此句判明欲使世界，爲英·美及其追隨國之世界者，即彼等志戰爭目的。彼等國域　離本國，淤南北太平洋或於四南亞洲方面或於所羅門羣島及新幾內亞方面，正與我忠勇　比之陸海軍精鋭展開死鬥，彼等究爲何於此瘴氣之地作若大犧牲，無外欲恢復彼等之世界殖民帝國而已。彼等不　其他民族之犧牲，實現此種野望，更欲使日本亦與其他東亞各國樣同化為彼　殖民，彼等現將重慶列入支配世界之一，此點官爲過去彼等夢想所不及者，擬依此博得重慶之歡心，使之叛變束亞，玩弄其使亞洲人制亞洲人毒辣手段，及日本實施對華新政策後，更對電慶撤廢不平等條約，改止華僑移　法案，作種種醜態，以討歡重慶。嗣於弈列賓之獨立，當其於美國統治時期，美國以種種手段還延，今美軍已被驅出菲律賓，菲律華於帘國協助下，而獲得獨立，美國頓感狠狽，似欲輿日本競爭，容　菲島獨立，現今要求賦與大總統此種權限，然菲律賀之獨立，惟有東亞人之奮起，始能得保。英國於其對印度制壓力微弱時，即甘言哄騙印度，俟內壓力一旦恢復，則不顧信義食言自肥，此次由於扛特拉鮑斯氏領導下之自由印度臨時政府已告成立。料英美將法印度提出與所子重慶同樑之條件，以示攏絡，然印度恢復底來面目，須待今人自身之覺悟與舊起。英美人之觀東亞成為最適於侵略榨取之殖民地地域，吾人則認束亞為東亞人之故鄕，吾人須防禦此等故鄉，此次戰爭乃東亞自存自衛之戰爭，日本若不能與束亞人共同防衛東亞，則不僅日本喪失其大國地位，東亞民族亦永無自主獨立之機會，將永被視為殖民地，而受人壓追。於此種意義之大束亞戰爭·即民族覺醒之門爭，與復興束亞才戰爭，因此東亞各國家，各民族爲完成戰爭，全面協方，乃屬當然之事實，今東亞復興之黎明已至·吾人必須防守東亞人之鄉土。謀共同之繁榮，此即日本戰爭之目的。束亞各民族已有自覺、必須勇往奮門，復歸東亞之本來面目，信認束亞本身、大東亞建設，乃世界和平之建設之一部，故對排除俊略　之戰爭，當為吾人所歡迎，吾人更進而謀以無分人種之差別·溝通文化，確立互惠經濟原則·開發資源，以實獻於確立世界新秩序。反觀違反正義之殖民地戰爭，收得勝利幾稀，有則僅鴉片戰爭而巳，即如美國人係於困難之戰爭中方始脫離英國而獨立，蓋戰爭之勝負，非僅由武器或物資之數量而決定，乃以必勝信念為完成戰爭之基礎，而決定我軍之威力，前綫軍民之精神，亦在於此。於今大東亞已得解放，東亞民族無不充滿喜樂及對未來之希望僅有基於互憲主義之共存共榮。今日之東亞，乃相互援助典協力之東亞，於善鄰友好之環境下，澈底爭求亞洲之解放與復興，而使世界覺醒之東亞，今日之東亞乃為完成此種神聖戰爭而戰·此卽東亞之眞姿。</p>

<h3>供應全滬民食　獲基本方案　戶口米每月可增至六升</h3>
<p>中央社訉上海糧食配給調整委員會，近以三省兩市之米糧，統由米　統制會收買配給，會在第一區公署會議室與米糧統制總會首腦部，舉行懇談會，商討關於上海民食之供應事件，經雙方詳密會商後，已獲有具體之基本方案，茲將詳情分誌於後。</p>
<p>由糧食調整會發配</p>
<p>關於三省兩市之來糧，統由米糧統制會實施收買後，所有滬市五百萬市民之供應，業經雙方決定，由上海糧食調整委員會，負貴領取發配，包括滬市之主要產業社團，友……邦　民。舟山羣島一帶之民衆米糧在內。糧食調委會對於米統會前供應之食米，委中華中米　配給組合洽領，而米欵亦由該組合代付。至食米採運上所需之包裝材料，決由調整會負責準備。</p>
<p>技術方式緊密協力</p>
<p>兩會對於技術上之方式，並經縝密商討。決定今後每月所應供給調委會食米之數量與種類，以及交貨地點與價格，應於前月廿日以前，由米統會通知調委會，俾資先時準備。同時復規定於每月十日前，將來月之配給計劃，以及上月配給之實績，由調委會通知米統會，兩會之相互緊密協力，將使滬市民食，從益臻此穩定。</p>
<p>每月數量增至六升</p>
<p>近月來，本市戶口米之數量，每期每口僅獲一升，滬市民衆，備感不敷，雖當局增加麵粉敷量，藉資配給調節，但市民習於米食，對於麵紛製食，尤感不便，上海糧食配給調整會與米統會之協力，將於短期內，使戶口米之配給　量，每月每口可逐漸遞增至六升以上，從此　市民食可無杞憂，而黑市米價，當可劇烈挫跌。查滬市按月所需之食米，約在廿三萬包左右。</p>
<p>袁氏晋京洽商統配</p>
<p>米糧統制委員會主任委員袁問登，於昨日偕　口守三顧問及潘敬賀李善　等，搭夜車晋京，準備出席三十日下午三時舉行之物　統制審議會會議，並將分訪京中有關當道，懇　統買及統配米糧事宜。據上海社記者探悉：米相統制委員會在三省各她區內之收購米糧工作，巳進入實施階段，各區分辦事處正式成立，依據旣定方針，統購米糧，袁氏此次晋京，目的在向蘇府當局報告及請示機宜，並　請關係方面之融通協助，吏糧統工作得能順利推展，袁氏留京頗暫，二三日後可望返滬，又訉，在京舉行之物資統制審議會議，除將商討糧統新機講之工作外，對於由油糧採運配給方案，及棉花統買配給方案之由油糧專業委員會及商統會會花專業部提呈審核者，可望通過，即付貿施。</p>
<h3>一區經濟處　進行特種調差　加緊澈查非法商人</h3>

<p>調查對象　　該處調查員，但有豐富社會經騐及常議，在執行業務時，皆執有身份證明文件，現關查之對象大致爲：　商店有無藏貨拒售情形，　出售貨物超越限價，或未奉核准　自增價，　門市商品不標明售價，　出售商品不開具發票或不登錄幀册，　未領許可　私自移動物資，　計口售給物品，各零售商店有無參與黑市交易，　商店有無攙雜或尅扣斤量，　有無使用不合標準底量衡器。　監督公會</p>

<h3>流浪兒的樂園　上海福幼院</h3>
<p>組織與經濟</p>
<p>上海福幼院的最高組織是董事會，包括）名譽董　會（名　董事長爲聞　亭，徐乾麟二氏，董事長爲丁福保氏，副董事長爲陳已生，陳春華，　柏　，黃警　四氏），　常務董事會（常董爲董斌，　思宏，丁東南，葉效良，錢齊靈，視匡明請氏），　勸幕委員會。下面有院務，經濟，宜傳，勸慕四組及特種委員會等組織，實際院務工作田副院長董斌主任馮森幹事姜天佑三位主持，主任絲理教導事務二處，教　處另　兒童　治指導委員會，事務處另　兒童　養研究委員會，校務方面分　教務，學籍，監護，統計，圖書會計，文書，庶務，衛生，給養，保管等股，組織上的分工，似乎已經　當精密，但是實際工作的敎職長連　士在內，不過十三位，分工合作，和哀共濟，以最少數的人辦極繁瑣與艱苦的事業。他們的待遇，　又十分濟苦，月薪最高額不過三百十五元，最低只有二百二十五元，供給簡單的勝宿。膳爲與院生無差別，靑菜淡飯，犧牲服務，不減其精　上的安樂。爲了不斷檢討自己的工作，改善敎養流浪苦難兒童的業務，教職員們遼在平時注力於進條，每星期舉行院務會統及生活檢討會一次，彼此一開　檢討研究，以期布業發展。他們從朱對自己的事業表示滿足，對人總是要求批評與指導，正固爲辦事人員這樣熱心努力，所以在短促的期問，居然成績　然。</p>
<p>不過上海福幼院的經費，一向在困難之中。去年幸得捐款二十六萬餘元，始得勉强維持，今年物價較諸往歲，何止數倍，生活程度高漲，給養費用隨之增加，困難情形，不難想見，木年春間，請求上海市貧病敘濟協會補助，由該會審核委員姚惠泉李文　二先生前往調查，認爲：「辦理狀况，尚稱良好，經濟上現雖呈入不數出之　，辦事處經收捐款不甚踴躍。」旋經決定補助三萬元，分一月三月五月三次支付，並鹽於該院內部空隙地方尙多，如將宿舍與敎室不加分開，即可多收容街頭流浪兒童約二百人，對於敎養苦難兒童事業，自有極大助益。此種意見，亦爲福幼院主持者所接受。可犧由於物價不斷高漲，開支溢出預算，一切計劃，仍是不克順利完成。春間舉行的第二次徵　，目標爲四十萬元，以充本年底經常敎養費用，結果成績超過　定目標，使該院一切事業得以維持與改善，但是談到擴充教　流浪兒童名額，據說目前尚難辦理，因爲以現狀而言，僅二百數十人的伙食開支（包括食料，燃料等）。每月最低限度已需要六七萬元，衣着及敎育費用，尚未計算在內，以前徽募所得，大部巳購買食料燃料及冬天必需的棉被，所以目前日常開交，據說早已在借　底日狀態之中了。</p>
<p>離開這二百二十八個流浪兒童的樂園，囘到　繁榮熱鬧的社會，在　燒的大街上和巍峨的巨厦下，還是匍匐着　頭垢面的丐童，還是充滿着流浪兒童的哀號，孩子們何罪而忍令至斯，因此愈令人想念到像福幼院那種事業之雖能可貴，然而他們也正期待着社會的扶助呢。（完）</p>

<p>中央社訉　本市保安處偵查隊，於十月二十日得據眼綫報皆，十月五日南　　沙鎭，友軍橫田　長被人槍殺案內，要犯蘇兆福。了學洪等，現　本市新慶路長　路口老中與旅社五號房間內，並　黨於十月中旬深夜，以搶獲被審橫田隊長所佩手槍一支，搶刦楊家橋地方朱某所設之麵粉店，及滬北某居戶等，得喊分用等語</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>失業的痛苦</h3>
<p>德國新聞社昨引新德里消息稱：和任印督之第一號公報發表印象云：「　見一貧困而半　之民族　景企求一夜之安眠，以等待翌日之患難及挨餓。　」這幾句話是形容印度飢饉的狀態，可是，我們認爲可以借用，拿來形容上海失業的痛苦，也朱嘗不是恰當的。環廠木市一般無告窮　流浪街頭者之饥寒苦况，何一不是如此？究其最大原因，還是由於失業，而失業的最大原因，還是由於戰事，因爲戰事發生以來，工廠相繼停工或縮小活動範圍，不要說是勞動階級了，就是平時抱有一技之長的技術人員，亦都迫得沒有　飯之所，終至流浪街頭，甚至坐以待斃，此情此景，已成爲全國各地一種普遍的現象，不僅是上海一隅而已，這正是昨日所論全社會之經濟問題，自未可等閒視之。</p>
<p>自從友邦交還各種廠以來，益以各方正在積極恢復各種生產活動，社會上失業的痛苦，也許可以獲得一部份的解決。本來，增加生產是有賴於人力與物力的同時集中，一面旣然高呼國家之增產，一面即不能坐視人民之失業，因爲這兩件事，是有如唇齒相依的。本市第一區公署社會福利處的職業介紹科從三十一年十二月問起，辦理失業人員登記，先從技術人員開始，遂自今年八月間起，辦理普通人才的職業介紹，這樣一個工作，倘能擴大推行，由國家主管機關予以推進，由社會公共團體予以協力，則其有助於社會之貧困與國家之生產老，實　至深且互！</p>
<h3>首期小麥配給後　各廠製粉緊張　二期收買工作即將展開</h3>
<p>本年度小麥首期菟買工作，業已告一設落，預定目標二百萬包，已全部蒐得，粉麥專業委員會已將是項小麥配給予各地麵粉廠。昨悉，京滬，　杭兩鐵路綫附近各縣之粉廠，自得配給小麥後，連日出紛情形，極爲緊張。又粉麥專委會爲欲早日實施前所訂定粉麩配給實施方案起見，特督促各廠加緊進行工作，現規模較大之粉廠，已增開夜工，因事變停頓之各廠，亦已恢復開車。</p>
<p>一部麵粉交換物資</p>
<p>各廠所出之粉，除供給蘇浙皖各省自里資，粉麥專委會主任委員孫仲立副主任委員井上泰忠兩人，已與華北當道協商就　，關於北運數量及運輸諸問題，已有具體辦法，並聞一部份麵粉已北運途中。</p>
<p>準備展關二期蒐買</p>
<p>小麥首期蒐買完成之後，將繼以二期蒐買，由於首期之經騐，二期成績更為圓滿，似可預　　粉麥專委會將派員至各地區分支辦事處視察，樂務上技術上如有缺陷之處謀以改進。</p>
<p>各業要求增加配量</p>
<p>本市各業需要麵粉者，自得配粉後，可爲低廉，但各業以配粉數量，每不夠實際需要，故要求酌予增加，專委會以此確係實情，當謀予以補殺，但亦發現有以配粉暗作黑市交易者，故今後對於審核工作，將更爲嚴密，一經查出，除永久停止配給權外，尚須依法懲辦</p>

<h3>決民戰眾與德日覺本悟　德富蘇峰本多熊太郞對談</h3>
<p>這樣一來．造成了一轉樣。此次的戰爭雖已經過了四年，但自三年前的　扣克慘敗以來，祗賴美國的幇助才能　　　自己的防　戰。在這裏美國顯然拿着二個頭來應付量戰。共一是要在這戰爭中打倒日本，另一是大家都已知適，最近七八年來，美國以爲美圃　可以支國世是的。露骨地說出由美國制國世界的書籍已經出得很多，而在另一方面，英國因。於護衛自已，故劉抽　不知　　，，滿　事鰓前義，我們　聽得勞含需治。的　溫，斯來　將軍們說，祗　美美　手，可以確保世界任何方面的和平。這樣。在美國人之問，引起了制　世界的對心。自從英國表示依存美網的　態時起，直至一九三二年賺斯關做大總統。實旅新經　政策。那是付了很高的代價。在那裏使用了很多的國發，可是一千萬人的失業。依然如故。</p>
<p>於是雖斯福感到有把人心轉向對外的必要。那就是作一次大戰。國民的制新世界慾。海軍固不必說。即在知織階級之間，亦抬頭起來。可是在歐洲，可惜因爲德國的抬頭，英國正在走頭撫路。於是羅斯福便想主演道齣好戲。格魯大使在滿洲事變的翌年，即從東京打電報輯告國：「西有德國，東有日本，打算制覇世界」，並　動觀。　　　　界的惡者，將威　美國本題。歐洲戰爭則由美國援助英法兩國而向德國挑戰。英　在鄧扣克慘敗之前的挪成戰之失敗後。張伯倫下野，邱吉爾出山，與此問時，共國亦遭受悲慘的條件。邱　爾爲總現時，決定了遂行戰爭的二大方針。</p>

<h3>關於煤球統制問題</h3>
<p>— 章君</p>
<p>在目前的上海，煤球確是一秤不可缺的燃料；它比炭便宜，比木柴簡便，由此，居民用煤球作爲燃料的幾佔全市百分之　五，這個驚人的數目更證明煤球在目簡的燃料中是佔着何等重要的地位，它的產量的多　又是何等地影　市民的安全呢！</p>
<p>最近一個月來。煤球現貨供應，日少一日一恐慌則與日俱增，尤其是最近幾天，市民大有斷炊之慮，長此以往，攸闢民生安定。至鉅且大。造成這種現　的根本原因，無空體　地，是當局配煤球廠之煤屑之減少，間時統制制度的有欠嚴密和廠商利潤的日趨減低，亦爲造成現貨供應奇缺和黑市畸形昻貫之主因。</p>
<p>如同解除民間痛苦，設法使此必當燃料。煤球趨於供當平衡之狀態，確是目前當局　研討而速求實現的一大問題！</p>
<p>增配衆屑與製造廠商，使廠商得充分之掣球原料；道樣產量旺盛。供應則自行平衡，黑市亦即自告絕跡。恐慌則無醫而滅。但是當局之減配煤屑‘自有其苦衷在；因此我們深盼當局按諸「闢源節流」之原則，一方而疏輰煤斤來源，一方面則極力節約無謂－不必　的消費，則於煤球之產量不無小補</p>
<p>然而煤球統制機　的加以調整和廠商利潤的略予增加亦是值得加以注意的問題。</p>
<p>關於煤球統制機構的加以調整問題，必先得知道其原始組織及其發展程序和現行組織的概括，這機才能夠使我們審察以律組織的優劣和現行組織的有欠嚴密，而對將來的機構調舉面有一種比較合式的改進。</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭開始時、煤球的供應正似目前一般；趣了當局和中日煤業的努力．才成立了以下的統制機　；</p>
<p>上面的　表是統制機構最完備時候的組織，　問始　立的時候．那當然是零缺不齊．發揮統制的效力可　是非常的　小．待到了完整的地步，雖然其效力並不如理想般的圓滿，但是統制的使命總算也完成了不少。</p>
<p>現在將圖表的細織程序說明如下．以便明瞭當時統制的情形。</p>
<p>興亞院華中運絡部和工部局煤斤統制委員會是並行的機關，它兼有上海地區以內移動許可的特樣；石炭聯合會是基於興亞院和煤球公會大中戰煤號的中間機關它有審定各煤球　每期配給原料及烘煤的數量，付與大國戰　號發　衆各廠商．所以在實際上操配　大權的是石炭戰合會；煤球公會第一部則由日方廠商組成．而第二部係由全上海大小廿九家華商廠家聯合製成；第一部之組織因事闢民生較少、暫不論外、至於第二部的工作差為多全是當局命令的傳　和調查各廠每月產銷及存底數量；大中聯煤號由念餘家煤號　織而成．它的使命不過是將石炭聯合會查定的配給景向日商三非．三菱．由下三洋行購賈而韓賣與各煤球廠商．收取佣金而已。至於工部局煤斤統制委員會之職權除移動許可外，其地如頭發小賣商之　業執照和密查價格的有否變動亦爲其主要工作。</p>
<p>當時興亞院所頒發之廠商原料許可證期限爲十日。由浦東日商煤棧運至各煤球廠目的地；小　商之移動許甸證期爲一月．由各廠運球至各店號。雖亞院改組爲（在上海日水大使館事務所）初期仍用之。</p>
<p>工部局煤斤統制委　會的負責人爲Duifg氏，主持煤球統制事務的是Cornwell氏它的許可證有二種：一．是　行派司（Customer　Permit）期為一　、由各廠送球與小賣　之用；還有一種是另擔派司（Picul　Permit）期為二十四小時．為廠家送直接定戶之用。</p>
<p>今年上半年因製球原料　富，煤球之生產呈供過於求之狀態　當局有鑒於此，便陸　將以上各種許可證取消、而成爲自由移動之物資。</p>
<p>至於現今的組織除了工部局煤斤統制會已早取消外，餘則一如舊例。</p>
<p>以上是統制機構的　括。雖然原料的配給還須決定於石廠聯合會。但是煤斤和煤球的移動却是採取自由的政策，這一次黑市的造成和供應的奇缺，其　結也就在此．</p>
<p>於煤球廠商的利潤．就本年四月煤球公會　二部所製定之成本表，其分配如下：原料成本原料煤白煤屑三〇七、八九元運費及缺數、六九、四二元煤灰、二一、〇〇元黃泥八、〇〇元費用成本烘煤三五、三五．〇〇元水電八．〇〇元工食二五．〇〇元利息八．〇〇元修理折舊四六。〇〇元事務費二七、〇〇元廠商利潤一四。六九合計五七〇、〇〇元註：成本以每噸爲標準從上表看來、廠商（四月）假使以每噸五百七十元之批價，則可得十四元六角九分純利；也是目前的同行批價爲五百五十元，雖然配給原料價格較前便宜．但是運費的幾度增加。煤灰、式泥、以及費用成本的增加，直接影　到製造成本的加增，其間接亦即影響到利潤的減低；際此生活程度高昂的上海，誰這再願投資這低利的　　呢？因此，一般廠商便將製球所用原料私下以高價　出，而獰鉅利；這樣，煤球的產量當然是不減亦就自減了。</p>
<p>至於小賣商以每噸五百五十元向廠商批進、加上運費　其他開支；試間以每　六百五十元購與　客，他們所得純利又是　樣呢？更何況最近各廠商另立名目在增加其他的費用呢－這樣、黑市的造成是否勢所必然？</p>
<p>最近物資統制處正派員四出偵查，使黑市絕跡，不過，我以爲這並非治本之法，反之，將會造成供應更呈缺乏之狀態。</p>
<p>最後我深盼當局一方面略予增高價格使廠商　合法利潤，同時加緊統　各製造廠商，使配給煤斤與產銷數量成規定比例；這　、廠商旣得相當利潤，又鑒於當局統制嚴緊。則無法使其伎倆，私　煤斤，原料旣多，產量自　，黑市亦不禁而自滅。不過，這這是目前比較容易實行的救濟辦法，至於最　整的制度那當然仍有待於當局計口配給制度的急　付諸實現。</p>

<h3>On the Burmese War Situation</h3>
<p>Mr. Nakajima, a minister in the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, clearly stated on the 27th of this month regarding the recent developments in the Greater East Asia War: "The anti-Axis forces intend to recapture Burma, but their preemptive offensive has been broken by Japan." This is the simplest explanation of the current Burmese war situation.</p>
<p>The importance of Burma in the East Asian war has long been recognized by all parties. Its importance is inseparable from the military, political, and economic aspects of the warring parties. Militarily, Burma is located at the westernmost end of the Greater East Asia War zone, between India, Chongqing, and the South Seas, and plays a pivotal role for both sides of the war. If the anti-Axis forces can control Burma, then firstly, they can advance northeast into the provinces of 省 (Guangdong), and this will allow the troop strength of these provinces to be transferred to 粵 (Yue), 湘 (Xiang), 贑 (Gan), 鄴 (Ye), and even 陝 (Shaanxi), 豫 (Henan), etc., without the need to divide and defend the poor frontiers of the southwest. Secondly, in the southeast direction, they can control the heartland of Vietnam and Thailand in the north, and support the back of Malaya in the south, coordinating with the navy in the Southwest Pacific from both air and land to peer into the South Sea Islands. Conversely, if the Japanese army can consolidate its occupation of Burma, the situation will be completely different. Not only can it protect the Japanese army's initial development and mobilization work, but it can also ensure a favorable posture for the offensive against India, and the anti-Axis forces' so-called "Pacific Counter-Offensive" will be forever difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The important military position of Burma is as mentioned above, but its political and economic significance cannot be ignored. From a political perspective, Burma is the link between Chongqing and India, and it is also the vanguard position for Britain and the United States to control southwestern China from the mainland. Therefore, once Burma loses its independence and is controlled by Britain and the United States, the gateway to southwestern China will be wide open, and Britain and the United States will be able to take whatever they want. Therefore, China cannot completely break free from its colonial status and achieve independence and integrity. Conversely, if Burma can truly become independent, it can not only serve as a barrier for southwestern China, but also boost the morale of the Indian national independence struggle, and ultimately end the fate of British and American dominance in East Asia.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, Burma is the Ukraine of India, and Burma is also the Caucasus of East Asia! In the former case, it is because Burmese rice has always been relied upon for the Indian people's food. Now, because Burma has been separated from India, it has not been two years, and the severity of the famine in eastern India has filled Calcutta, the "London of India," with starving people. Recently, Reuters had to send a telegram about people behaving like animals due to hunger! In the latter case, the oil production in Burma has great significance for the military and economic situation of India and Chongqing, but today it is used to attack India and Chongqing! At the same time, since Burma declared independence and nationhood on August 1 and declared war on Britain and the United States, all its resources, power, and even manpower have been determined to contribute to the final victory of Greater East Asia, and the severity of the blow to the anti-Axis countries cannot be described in words!</p>
<p>The anti-Axis countries naturally feel very painful about the situation in Burma! It is true that Britain and the United States are focusing their efforts on dealing with Germany in their global strategy, but the pain in their hearts over the decline of their imperialist hegemony in the East is far greater than their concern for Europe. Therefore, their ambition for East Asia - that is, their ambition to restore their position in East Asia - has never been forgotten. Especially for Burma, they are eager to strive for it because: without striving for Burma, it is not enough to shield India; without striving for Burma, they cannot fully implement their promise to aid Chongqing, nor can they support Chongqing's dragging out the war; without striving for Burma, they cannot establish a unified front among the land, sea, and air forces of the anti-Axis forces in the "Pacific counter-offensive" operation. But how to strive for Burma? Because the navy from the Mediterranean has not yet been able to move to the Indian Ocean, and because the air force and navy in the Pacific are in the distress of "consuming one ton of bombs per square," they mainly rely on the military forces of India and Chongqing, especially the latter. According to recent telegrams, the troop strength concentrated in the Nujiang and Dianshui areas of southern Yunnan is extremely large in number. At the same time, after the Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia held a military conference in India, there was news of him flying to Chongqing to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. Their meticulous planning for the war in Burma is clearly evident!</p>
<p>However, the supporter of Burmese independence is the Japanese military authorities, the protector of the East Asian people. They will not ignore this ambition and strategy of the anti-Axis forces in the slightest. On the contrary, they are never in a defensive position of being beaten passively, but firmly maintain the posture of an attacker. When the anti-Axis forces have not yet made a decision, they first launched military and political offensives. In the political aspect, as early as August 1, they helped Burma achieve independence and nationhood, and then assisted the Philippines in achieving complete independence and the Indian Provisional Government in announcing its establishment. In front of the oppressed colonial peoples, they used facts to explain the significance of the Greater East Asia War and exposed the true face of British and American imperialists. This political offensive is the greatest military cooperation, and its strength is still difficult to estimate now. Following closely behind the political offensive is the military counter-attack. The Nujiang River West Bank and Dianshui operations over the past two weeks can be said to have fundamentally dealt a powerful blow to the "recapture Burma plan." Even in the United States, this has been particularly noted in recent days. A Central News Agency telegram from the capital of Argentina on the 27th pointed out the precarious situation of the Chongqing army on the Nujiang River, giving the Americans great stimulation. The United States has admitted that the goal of the Japanese army's operation is to encircle and completely annihilate the Chongqing army on the west bank of the Nujiang River. Now, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's communiqué also admits that the elite Japanese troops are conducting lightning attacks and fierce assaults on the west bank of the Nujiang River, seizing river crossing points, and have a momentum of crossing the river eastward. Of course, it is not yet time to make a comprehensive assessment of the war situation in western Yunnan, southern Yunnan, and even the entire western Burma, but the overall situation is quite clear. We can already say that the anti-Axis forces' slogan of "recapturing Burma" has been shouted for a year, just like the "second front" in Europe, it is just empty talk. Now, before the anti-Axis forces' actions have even begun, they have not only been hit by a political iron fist, but have also suffered from a military steel whip. Britain and the United States are eating their own bitter fruit, which is not worth mentioning. Isn't the lesson learned by Chongqing still not enough?</p>
<h3>Japanese Extraordinary Session Passes "Greater East Asia Rising" Proposal Prime Minister Tojo Clarifies Determination to Win</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The 83rd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet held a plenary session yesterday morning to discuss the Greater East Asia Rising Resolution. After Mr. Kanemitsu Tsuneo explained the purpose of the proposal, it was unanimously passed with satisfaction. The contents of the proposal are as follows: that each nation finds its place, and all people find their security, based on the spirit of morality, the new world order is the great ideal of Japan's founding and the common goal of Greater East Asia. Now, the enemy's non-hope of dominating East Asia, Britain and America, has been destroyed, the building of Greater East Asia is seeing progress, and the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is becoming more consolidated. Burma and the Philippines have now achieved their long-cherished wish, and India has also established a provisional government, which will soon break free from the shackles of Britain for many years, causing Chongqing to also lose its war of resistance. Therefore, the one billion people of East Asia should unite as one, struggle together, destroy the common enemy, and permanently preserve East Asia, in order to establish lasting peace in the world.</p>

An American Central Broadcasting Station commentator also pointed out that the Southwest Pacific Command initially said that the Japanese army was withdrawing from the mountains north of Finschhafen last week, and then announced that the Japanese army had launched another attack, which is confusing. Is it possible that the Command also did not receive detailed information about the situation?</p>

<h3>Italy Rebuilds National Army to Fight Alongside Allies Cabinet Meeting Passes New Army Bill</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - The US government held a cabinet meeting in Venice on the 27th, and approved the bill on the reconstruction of the new national army proposed by Minister of Defense Marshal Graziani. President Mussolini gave a speech on the spot: "Since the first cabinet meeting was convened by the Fascist government, the revival of the national spirit has made significant progress. Although the Italian people were thrown into the abyss of humiliation and collapse by the betrayal of traitors in July and September, the national spirit has now begun to extricate itself in order to escape this sea of ​​suffering. The new order of the motherland will soon reveal its outline in the military aspect. Marshal Graziani, with the assistance of General Gambara, will once again lead the nation to fight alongside the Axis and the Three-Power Pact comrades against the enemy. The "New National Army Bill" that was submitted to the cabinet meeting is based on the war experience of the past four years and aims to compile a modern and powerful army. Based on this bill, the Italian army, navy, and air force will be rebuilt, and there are also plans to set up an air defense force directly under the air force.</p>

At that time, a group of officials on duty, all those who did not join the enemy, would legally receive an pension. The second article of the new law stipulates that the three armed forces of the Italian National Republic will be established on September 9. Soldiers of all ranks, whoever requests to join the new army and continue to serve under the Republican flag out of a sense of national self-consciousness, will be allowed to continue their service. Regarding pay and rations, the new Italian army will be subject to the same conditions as the current German army. The article also states that the Carabinieri Corps will continue to maintain order.</p>

He arrived back in Tokyo at 5:00 PM on the 26th and gave a speech to the Chinese press corps in Japan on the 27th, saying as follows: "I have returned to China to report on my work. After witnessing the unanimous spirit of the entire country, both in the government and in the public, striving to develop after China recovered the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, and Japan's increasingly strengthened position under the wartime system, I am filled with unlimited joy at the bright future of Greater East Asia. In the current situation in East Asia, I feel that in order for China to thoroughly complete its mission of nation-building and to have the strength to share the responsibility of 精束亚 (refined East Asia), it is urgently necessary to realize comprehensive peace between China and Japan. China and Japan, from the standpoint of East Asian nations, are brotherly countries, and their fates are closely related. The struggle between the snipe and the clam only benefits the fisherman. This has long been the conclusion of knowledgeable people. Now, China and Japan have gone from understanding to friendship, and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has led to cooperation and efforts towards a common sacred goal. Japan's sincerity will enable the Chinese government and public to have a deeper understanding. The ideals of "I love my country," "I also love my neighboring country," and "Building East Asia together" should permeate the hearts of everyone, concentrating all efforts to complete the great cause of the Greater East Asia War. As the ambassador to Japan, I sincerely have even deeper expectations for this."</p>
<h3>On the West Bank of the Nu River, Japanese Forces Achieve Major Victory; Longling, Mangshi, and Chongqing Troops Surrounded</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Yunnan front report, after the Japanese army's elite units launched a fierce offensive in Yunnan, they have achieved significant victories on the west bank of the Nu River. This operation has had a great impact on the Allied forces, especially the Chongqing side, who are deeply terrified by the Japanese advance. Observing the remarkable achievements of the Japanese army, both sides suffered significant losses. The Chongqing army abandoned over a thousand bodies, while the Japanese army only suffered a few deaths in action. The Japanese mopping-up units are currently suppressing the Chongqing army's 36th Division in the Mingguang River, Longchuan River, and Kongcha River areas, expanding their gains. As a result, the encircled troops are in dire straits and are attempting to flee north towards Liuku. However, the river crossing points are controlled by the Japanese army, and their retreat is further obstructed by the treacherous Gaoligong Mountains. Their retreat routes have been completely cut off, and they are frequently attempting to hide their weapons in the mountains and escape in civilian clothes. The encircled Chongqing troops in Longling, Mangshi, and Pingga are currently breaking through the Japanese encirclement to rescue these Chongqing troops, but have ultimately failed. The Chongqing side is doing its utmost to conceal the above facts, and fearing a Japanese advance eastward, they are gathering a considerable number of reinforcements from Yongping via Guanlan to the opposite bank of the Lishui River in Liuku, claiming that they are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Furthermore, the anti-Axis side, having suffered defeat by the encircled troops, has reported that American military commentator Baldwin confirmed in the New York Times that the Burma Road is now entirely under Japanese control. Currently, the Chongqing army is requesting assistance from the British army in eastern India, but the British army in that area remains neutral, further exposing the discord among the anti-Axis powers.</p>
<p>Heavy Fighting Continues in the Gaoligong Mountains</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Commission announced on the 26th that heavy fighting continues in the Gaoligong Mountains along the Yunnan-Burma border.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Yunnan front report, a unit of the Chongqing army in Yunnan escaped from a certain mountain at dawn on the 20th, attempting to flee to the east bank of the Nu River via the Gaoligong Mountain road. However, because their retreat route had been newly established, the Japanese Fukuda unit further surrounded and attacked them. After fierce fighting, the 36th Division's 108th Regiment suffered heavy losses. The body of Chongqing army regimental commander Yang Yunhong was found in this battle. According to documents captured from the 108th Regiment Commander of the 36th Division in this battle, it has been definitively proven that, apart from the 36th Division Commander Li Zhihong, other military leaders such as the 36th Division Deputy Commander, as well as the Self-Defense Army Commander Zhu Zhenhua, the 108th Regiment Commander, and the 106th Regiment Commander, are all trapped within the Japanese encirclement. The elite units of the encircled army are currently compressing the encirclement. Furthermore, the Japanese army dropped surrender leaflets from aircraft on the 27th. According to Chongqing army prisoners, the encircled troops lack food and have lost their will to fight, and all hope to surrender. It seems that the Chongqing army's attempt in this Nu River operation has been completely thwarted, and they have no way to rescue the troops surrounded by the Japanese army, leaving them with no choice but to wait for death.</p>
<h3>Nine American Aircraft Attack Haikou Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>Haikou, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Nine enemy B-24 Liberator and North American B-25 bombers attacked the Haikou area of Hainan Island on the 26th in four waves at a low altitude of 300 meters. The Japanese naval air force and ground forces immediately responded and shot down a total of three aircraft, destroying one more, and repulsed the enemy. The Japanese aircraft also lost two aircraft, one of which rammed an enemy aircraft and perished with the enemy. In addition, several small transport vessels were lost.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Advances Smoothly</h3>
<p>Beiping, Central News Agency – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base, Japanese elite units have been continuously advancing for days in the steep terrain on all sides of the eastern route in Southern Shanxi, confronting the Chongqing army. From the 7th to the 12th of this month, the results were as follows: 80 communist soldiers killed, 75 rifles captured, 127 bullets, 1 pistol, 1 printing press, 1,500 sheep, and a large amount of electrical wire, etc. Furthermore, the Japanese army mopping up the area near the Qin River, from the 2nd to the 23rd of this month, achieved the following results: 5 pistols, 6 bullets, 30 rifles captured, 1 light machine gun, 5 pistols, 836 bullets, 1 automatic rifle, 3,590 cattle and sheep, and a large number of hand grenades, field artillery shells, and landmines, etc. In addition, two grain depots and one telephone exchange were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Macao Correspondence: The Old Story of the Burma Campaign is Retold</h3>
<p>We should remember that one of the main topics discussed by Roosevelt and Churchill at the Quebec Conference was the struggle for Burma, with two objectives: first, to reopen the Burma Road to prevent the Chongqing side from becoming disillusioned with the United Kingdom and the United States and leaving the anti-Axis alliance; second, to use important locations within the Chongqing territory as bases to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland. Therefore, their initial goal was to seize northern Burma, breaking through the heavily guarded borders of Baoshan, Tengyue, Myitkyina, and Dunskiye, and begin constructing a northwest route connecting India.</p>
<p>As a result of the Quebec Conference, Mountbatten was appointed Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, flew to New Delhi, and convened Auchinleck, Stilwell, and others to discuss future strategies. In the border area between Burma and India, the deployment of British Indian troops had been completed, and the air force had been greatly strengthened, glaring at the Japanese line, ready for battle. At the same time, in the naval aspect, because the Mediterranean war had come to an end, a part of the British fleet was drawn from the Atlantic and Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, preparing to launch a simultaneous land and sea offensive.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Contend for Command</p>
<p>However, although Mountbatten combined land, sea, and air forces, ready to fight for Burma, internal opinions were divided. Mountbatten and the American Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur, clashed over the operational area and command authority. Chiang Kai-shek and Stilwell also disdained to be commanded by him. If the front line was like this, how could the rear be any different? American Secretary of the Navy Knox and British Home Secretary Morrison, on the question of the Pacific campaign and on the division of sacrifices between the two sides, both wanted to infringe on the other and let others fight like clams while they reaped the fisherman’s benefits. This kind of attempt fully exposed their weaknesses.</p>
<p>However, despite the conflict of authority and personnel friction between the United Kingdom and the United States on the issue of command, and despite everyone wanting to avoid responsibility and shirk sacrifices, the struggle for Burma was a military operation that they had to actively carry out. Otherwise, the Chongqing side would inevitably withdraw, and their anti-offensive posture in East Asia would have no basis for preparation at all.</p>
<p>The rainy season in Burma has passed. British Indian troops and Chongqing troops, under the banner of "recovering Burma," began to roll.</p>
<p>The Burma Pacification Campaign</p>
<p>Last May, the Japanese army began the Burma pacification campaign, attacking with irresistible force and launching a decisive battle on the notoriously treacherous Yunnan border. At that time, the Japanese Yunnan invasion force that began the attack first destroyed the forward strongholds of the Chongqing Chiang direct line army, which was attempting to recover Burma, crossed treacherous mountains over 3,000 meters high, and seized Tengyue, Longling, and Lameng, thoroughly disrupting Chongqing’s lifeline – the Burma Road station. Since then, the Chongqing army has continued to wage guerrilla warfare to seize the Burma Road, and has repeatedly suffered blows. In a battle in February of this year, the Central Army’s Reserve 2nd Division was destroyed by the Japanese army. However, at the instigation of the British in May, it once again dreamed of recovering Burma, attempting to seize the forward strongholds for reopening the Yunnan-Burma Road. Taking advantage of the rainy season, it sent the 36th Division (Commander Li Zhihong) under the command of Expeditionary Force Commander Chen Cheng to the west of the Nu River, leading Zhu Zhenhua (Deputy Commander of the 36th Division and Commander of the Tenglong Border Area Self-Defense Army) and Xie Pusheng, Commander of the Border Area Guerrilla Forces, to begin operations. Chongqing did not hesitate to exhaust the country’s resources, stubbornly defending the Burma-India border line, which the British regarded as their lifeline, but remained unaware. Its situation is truly pitiful.</p>
<p>Blockading the Nu River Crossing Points</p>
<p>The Japanese army's Yunnan invasion force began its offensive on October 15. That day, it occupied a certain area of the Chongqing army's base and thrust into Lengshui Gully, seizing the narrow road on the Chongqing army's rear. On the afternoon of the 16th, it captured a certain place, pursuing the defeated army. At noon on the 17th, it broke into a certain place, blockading the Nu River crossing points and completely cutting off the enemy's retreat. Over 15,000 Chongqing troops, centered on the 36th Division, became rats in a sack, running wildly and falling into the Japanese encirclement. At the same time, a certain forward detachment traversed the treacherous Gaoligong Mountains, known as the world's most dangerous, and occupied Lishi at 5:00 PM on the 16th. At 2:00 PM on the 17th, it thrust into the Nu River crossing point of Lichai Dam. A certain unit of the Japanese army, which had detoured northwest of the Nu River crossing point, also crossed a certain height on the 16th and advanced into a certain place. The two armies joined forces to seal the mouth of the great encirclement and annihilation battle. Under the general offensive of the Japanese army from the north and south, the Chongqing army had no foothold. According to prisoners, Li Zhipeng, the commander of the 30th Division, who was rumored to be launching a general counter-offensive in Burma, had long abandoned his troops and fled near Lichai Bridge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Chongqing army claimed to have dispatched 350,000 expeditionary troops to Yunnan to increase its military strength, and separately sent 50,000 elite troops to eastern India by air transport, heading to the British-American defense line on the Indian border. For this aspect of the British-Chongqing army, a certain unit of the Japanese army departing from Myitkyina, bypassing to the left and rear, began operations, attacking the front of the British-Chongqing army, breaking through its defense line, and linking up with the units attacking the base of the 26th Division, forming a large encirclement.</p>
<p>The area trapped within the Japanese encirclement includes the plains around Tengyue and the Longchuan River Valley, which is a fertile agricultural area and a logistics base for the Chongqing side. It is now harvest season, and waves of golden rice ears are rippling in the vast, boundless rice paddies. The loss of this area is a fatal blow to the Chongqing side, and the connection with the Chongqing army stationed in India has also been severed, and the attempt at joint British-Chongqing operations has completely lost hope.

<h3>Japan's Extraordinary Session of Parliament Is Highly Valued by Our Government and People; We Should Cooperate with Friendly Nations to Fulfill Our Mission</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to political figures here, in the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Parliament, Prime Minister Tojo mentioned "China for the Chinese," and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated "East Asia is the homeland of East Asians." Therefore, our government and people attach even greater importance to this session of the Japanese Parliament. Under the leadership of our Supreme Leader, President Wang, our aim in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War and participating in the war is solely to revive China and defend East Asia. The situation in the Japanese Extraordinary Session of Parliament in the past two days is sufficient to show Japan's determination to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States, and at the same time, Japan's sincerity in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been shown to the world. Analyzing the current situation, Tojo said, "At this time of decisive battle, one hundred million government officials and people are using the current stage of the war as a turning point, and are all engaged in battle deployment, concentrating all their strength on destroying the United Kingdom and the United States for His Majesty the Emperor." In the future, our only path is victory. This is Japan's determination to strive for victory, and its unwavering belief in victory can also be seen. This is not only trusted by our country, but also by all countries and nations in East Asia. As for his foreign affairs remarks, Japan's diplomatic policy has also been explained in detail. The concept of building a new order has already been displayed, and it should be understood and supported by all East Asians. Prime Minister Tojo specifically expressed his respect for our country's will to create the ideal of "China for the Chinese" and to work hard to liberate the billion people of East Asia, and our country, from top to bottom, also deeply believes that "reviving China and defending East Asia" can certainly be accomplished. Looking at Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement, "East Asia is the homeland of East Asians," then destroying the United Kingdom and the United States and liberating East Asia is the responsibility that every East Asian person should fulfill. At the end of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement, he said, "What the Greater East Asian nations demand is co-existence and co-prosperity, mutual understanding and mutual concession. This spirit is the true face of Greater East Asia today." Therefore, the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia is the unanimous demand of the East Asian people, and the foundation for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War can be said to be laid here. What our people especially pay attention to is Prime Minister Tojo's statement that the fundamental revision of the China-Japan Basic Treaty will be materialized, which will definitely help "revive China and defend East Asia." Our country, from top to bottom, can only exert all its strength and work hand in hand with friendly Japan to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States and accomplish this great mission.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Based on the fundamental spirit of adjusting national relations and respecting the integrity of our country's sovereignty and territory, friendly Japan has implemented the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The issue of enemy property in China under the management of the Japanese army is also in line with the same intention, and batches have been transferred to the National Government for management, totaling 1,275 items. In the most recent period, friendly Japan has also decided to transfer the third batch of British and American enemy property in Central and Northern China (87 items) to our country for management. In addition to notifying our authorities, the Japanese Embassy in China issued the following statement: Based on the fundamental spirit of adjusting national relations and respecting the integrity of China's sovereignty and territory, the Japanese government has decided on a policy of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. This policy was put into effect on the day the National Government declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. As for the issue of enemy property in China under the management of the Japanese army, it has also been decided to transfer it to the National Government for management in accordance with the same intention. On February 2, 1,003 items of British and American enemy property in various parts of Central and Northern China were transferred to the National Government for management. Subsequently, in June, 459 items of British and American enemy property in the Hankou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen areas were transferred to the National Government in succession. The number of items already implemented has reached 1,275. The Japanese government has now decided to transfer the third batch of 87 British and American enemy properties in North China to the National Government for management. The National Government has been notified today, including the Hotel des Wagon-Lits in Beiping, the American Fengyang Company in Tianjin, and dock warehouse buildings. In addition, there are churches and other cultural facilities. As for the remaining parts of the British and American enemy properties in China confiscated by Japan, they will continue to be transferred, and the necessary investigations are currently being conducted. Once the investigations are completed, they will be implemented gradually. In addition to the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese government has also decided to transfer the enemy properties of other countries in China, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway, to the National Government for management. A portion of them has been investigated and is scheduled to be officially notified to the National Government for takeover in the near future. We deeply believe that the National Government will, based on the purpose of receiving enemy property, take back the economic and cultural aggressive facilities of the United Kingdom and the United States in China for many years and make good use of them to actively cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. The following is the category of enemy property in Central and Northern China that the National Government has taken over for the first three times: In North China: buildings and facilities 3, hotel industry 1, church facilities 41, school facilities 16, cultural facilities 1, totaling 62 items. In Central China: dock and warehouse facilities 5, cold storage facilities 1, public facilities 1, oil extraction facilities 1, miscellaneous facilities 1, textile industry facilities 1, chemical industry facilities 2, lumber industry facilities 2, food industry facilities 1, construction industry 1, banking industry 1, trade industry 1, entertainment facilities 5, guildhall facilities 1, insurance industry 5, totaling 25.

That area suffered from a cyclone last year, and is now suffering from famine this year, so the disaster is extremely serious. On Tuesday alone, 100 corpses of starving Indians were cremated in Calcutta. Another striking phenomenon is that large trucks marked with the letters (CDL), meaning corpse collection trucks, are coming and going on the streets of Calcutta.</p>

Liang also said that the British government continues to export Indian food regardless of the serious Indian famine, causing food prices in India to rise endlessly, currently 250 to 1,500 times the pre-war prices. Therefore, without immediate countermeasures, 25 million to 30 million people will die of starvation. The conference immediately passed a resolution demanding the resignation of British Secretary of State for India Amery and the formation of a national government of India.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The food shortage in Bengal, India, is becoming increasingly serious due to the Indian authorities' ineffective response.

The reporter went to visit him and received the following remarks: What impressed me most on this trip was that when the President came to Beiping last year, the teenagers and people who listened to the President's speech on the radio were moved and invigorated. The affairs of the New People's Society have also developed day by day due to the promotion of this appeal. The current situation in the North is much better than last year. The promotion of the joint people's movement, its goals and spirit, are in accordance with the central government's intentions, and progress is very rapid. When I arrived in Beiping, it was the beginning of the issuance of the decisive battle life saving program, which was tight and admirable. In addition to the provinces and cities in the North, there were also representatives from the Central China Youth Model Group participating in the Youth General Review, reaching more than 18,000 people. It goes without saying that they were living in open air, and all the emblems had been changed to the Blue Sky, White Sun, and National Emblem, with uniform steps and good order. What is most admirable is the spirit of unity and the vigorous vitality of the youth groups, regardless of the North. The state funeral for Central China was set for the 31st of this month. Due to war affairs, I was eager to return to Nanjing, so I had the funeral committee handle the prior memorial service on the 27th.

<h3>Southwest of Melitopol Fierce Bayonet Fighting Breaks Out; Intense Battles on the Right Bank of the Dnieper River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency, citing a war report from the Führer's headquarters, stated: The intense offensive and defensive battles between Azov and the Dnieper River, with their focus remaining southwest of Melitopol yesterday. The enemy attempted to create a breakthrough on a large scale, but it was rendered ineffective by German troops engaging in close combat or by counterattacks from German mobile reserve forces. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. The enemy, at the estuary of the Dnieper River bend, attacked north of Kryvyi Rih and south of Nikopol with a large number of infantry and tanks but also failed to achieve results. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, the enemy launched a new offensive north of Gomel and continued their attempts to break through German positions in the areas west of Klinzy and Smolensk. The enemy reportedly collapsed due to being unable to withstand the concentrated German artillery fire.</p>
<p>Strategic Encirclement Unlikely to Succeed</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency: The war situation report from the southern sector of the Eastern Front on the 27th is as follows: In the Melitopol area, the Soviet forces are actively redeploying troops to launch fierce attacks in the Melitopol area, indicating that their target is not only the southern German positions, but also an attempt to encircle and annihilate the German forces on a large scale. Soviet forces, with several divisions of infantry and powerful cavalry, attempted to break through German positions west of Melitopol. Although they briefly penetrated German positions in some areas, the Soviet advance was halted by German counterattacks from the flanks. Elsewhere, Soviet forces launched an attack on German forces south of Chaplynka, using tanks as their main force. They were fiercely attacked by German mechanized units, and an entire Soviet tank division was annihilated. In the Dnieper River bend area, on the 26th, Soviet forces attacked the breakthrough area northwest of Dnipropetrovsk with several infantry divisions under the cover of powerful tanks and aircraft. They were repulsed by German counterattacks, and the Soviet offensive made no progress, resulting in heavy losses and retreat. Soviet forces also attacked north and northwest of Kryvyi Rih with large mechanized forces and even broke through German positions for several kilometers, but they were repelled by a courageous counterattack by German mechanized units, followed by a rapid pursuit that cut off the rear of some of their tank units, completely annihilating them.</p>
<h3>Three-Nation Conference Discusses Balkan Issues; Rumors of Soviet Demands for Access to the Black Sea</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency): Representatives from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, and those who attended from Britain and the United States subsequently attended a tea party at the British-American Club. The three-nation representatives continued to hold meetings at the guest house. US representative Hull, British representative Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held discussions for three hours. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Moscow: The talks will last longer than the originally scheduled nine sessions, and the representatives of the two countries are about to discuss the most important issues in the talks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency dispatch: According to a "Social Democratic Newspaper" communication from London: British diplomatic sources believe that the Moscow Conference is currently beginning to discuss Balkan issues, and the scope of the discussion will likely include the Soviet Union's demand for access through the Dardanelles Strait, the Sea of Marmara, and the Bosphorus. Because this issue is largely related to Turkey, Turkish figures in London have appeared anxious recently. They are particularly concerned about the news that the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, will go to Cairo, as Foreign Secretary Eden will return to Britain via Cairo after the conference, at which time the two can meet. The Moscow Conference may continue for another ten days. Furthermore, according to TASS news: Stalin met with Eden on Wednesday, with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr present.</p>
<p>Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency): The "New York Times" correspondent in Washington reports that the main issue discussed at the Moscow Conference is the establishment of a second front and other military issues. However, the discussion is not limited to this. The anti-Axis attitude towards Poland, Finland, and other countries where Soviet influence is clearly visible is also on the agenda.</p>
<h3>Knatchbull-Hugessen Left Ankara Yesterday</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 28th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency, citing a British report, stated: The British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, has recently left Ankara to travel to Jerusalem with his wife.</p>
<h3>War Situation in Southern Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): According to the Overseas Chinese News Agency: Since the 26th, although British and American forces have resumed activities on the southern Italian front, it cannot yet be considered a large-scale offensive. Their actions still aim to seize favorable positions with advance units before deploying heavy troops for a large-scale invasion. However, German forces have been effective in their defense efforts over the past few weeks, and the Americans have gained a foothold in the mountains, but have not made further progress. The German defense line in the upper Volturno River area has been quite effective. In the Agnone area, General Clark, on the right bank of the Matese Mountains, and the British Eighth Army, on the left flank near Venafro and Boiano, attempted to seize the forward outposts, but failed. Enemy pressure has slightly increased southwest of Campobasso, but there has been no significant progress in recent days. The right wing of the British Eighth Army has been moved to the immediate front line, and enemy artillery is also very active, with their actions suggesting a desire to concentrate artillery for a fierce offensive.</p>

<h3>Seeking Common Prosperity in East Asia Based on Equality and Reciprocity; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Clarifies War Aims</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency): Foreign Minister Shigemitsu answered questions from Mr. Yadanji Nakajima at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 27th. A summary of the main points was published yesterday; the full text is now supplemented as follows.</p>
<p>The construction of Greater East Asia is based on the voluntary cooperation of all ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. From Japan's perspective, the basic policy is to enable each ethnic group to achieve its aspirations based on the concept of equality and reciprocity. Therefore, it is necessary to break down the international relations that have hindered the principles of equality and reciprocity in the past and to promote cooperation and mutual assistance among the ethnic groups of East Asia based on the principle of mutual protection and harmony. The great spirit of Japan's founding is certainly not to monopolize Greater East Asia; it is the justice that has been respected by Eastern sages throughout history. Mr. Nakajima's opinion is most appropriate in content, and the government is currently studying concrete and effective policies and has already implemented comprehensive measures. Mr. Nakajima's question concerns Japan's basic foreign policy regarding the Greater East Asia War. I will briefly state my views and explain them. This war is the largest imperialist war provoked and initiated by Britain and the United States. The policy of Britain and the United States is to turn most of the world into their colonies. They are using Chongqing as their pawn, conspiring against East Asia, and plotting to permanently control India and the Philippines. Their sinister hand of aggression against East Asia has already extended into Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula during this war. They also want to seize Burma and then attempt to restore their dominance over China and all East Asians. The war aims of the United States stem from a desire to build a world empire and to further strengthen their control over the northern and southern Pacific and the Philippines, making it a base for suppressing East Asia. This clearly demonstrates that they intend to make the world a world of Britain, the United States, and their followers, which is their war aim. They are far from their own country and are engaged in mortal combat in the northern and southern Pacific, southern Asia, the Solomon Islands, and New Guinea with our loyal and courageous elite army and navy. Why are they making such great sacrifices in these pestilential lands? They are merely seeking to restore their world colonial empire. They disregard the sacrifices of other ethnic groups in order to realize this ambition and want to assimilate Japan and other East Asian countries into their colonies. They are now including Chongqing as one of the powers that will dominate the world, something they could not have dreamed of in the past. They intend to win Chongqing's favor by this and to play the sinister trick of using Asians to control Asians. After Japan implemented its new policy towards China, it abolished unequal treaties with Chongqing, changed laws restricting overseas Chinese, and made various ugly gestures to please Chongqing. Subsequently, regarding the independence of the Philippines, during its period of American rule, the United States used various means to delay it. Now that the American military has been driven out of the Philippines, and the Philippines has gained independence with the help of cooperating countries, the United States feels humiliated and seems to want to compete with Japan by granting the Philippines independence. They are now requesting to grant the President this authority. However, the independence of the Philippines can only be guaranteed by the awakening of East Asians. When Britain's control over India was weak, it used sweet words to deceive India. Once its internal control was restored, it disregarded its promises and enriched itself. Now, under the leadership of Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose, the Provisional Government of Free India has been established. It is expected that Britain and the United States will offer India the same conditions as Chongqing to win it over. However, India's return to its true form depends on the awakening of its people and their uprising. The British and Americans see East Asia as the most suitable colonial region for exploitation, while we recognize East Asia as the homeland of East Asians. We must defend this homeland. This war is a war of self-preservation and self-defense for East Asia. If Japan cannot defend East Asia together with East Asians, then not only will Japan lose its status as a great power, but the East Asian ethnic groups will never have the opportunity for autonomy and independence and will forever be regarded as colonies and subjected to oppression. In this sense, the Greater East Asia War is a war of national awakening and a war to revitalize East Asia. Therefore, it is a matter of course that the countries and ethnic groups of East Asia should cooperate fully to complete the war. Now that the dawn of East Asian revitalization has arrived, we must defend the homeland of East Asians and seek common prosperity. This is the aim of Japan's war. The ethnic groups of East Asia have become aware and must move forward bravely, returning East Asia to its original form. We believe that East Asia itself, the construction of Greater East Asia, is part of the construction of world peace. Therefore, we welcome the war to eliminate aggression, and we further seek to bridge cultural gaps, establish reciprocal economic principles, and develop resources without racial discrimination in order to contribute to the establishment of a new world order. On the other hand, colonial wars that violate justice rarely achieve victory, with the exception of the Opium War. Even the Americans had to struggle through a difficult war before gaining independence from Britain. The outcome of a war is not determined solely by the quantity of weapons or materials, but by the unwavering belief in victory, which forms the basis for completing the war and determines the power of our military. The spirit of the military and civilians on the front lines also lies in this. Today, Greater East Asia has been liberated, and the ethnic groups of East Asia are filled with joy and hope for the future, based solely on coexistence and co-prosperity based on mutual respect. Today's East Asia is one of mutual assistance and cooperation, thoroughly striving for the liberation and revitalization of Asia in a friendly and harmonious environment, and awakening the world. Today's East Asia is fighting to complete this sacred war. This is the true form of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Basic Plan Obtained to Supply Food to All of Shanghai; Monthly Rice Ration Can Be Increased to Six Sheng Per Person</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee recently decided that rice from three provinces and two municipalities would be purchased and distributed uniformly by the Rice Control Association. The committee held a discussion with the leaders of the Rice Control Association at the First District Public Office meeting room to discuss the issue of supplying food to Shanghai residents. After detailed discussions between the two sides, a concrete basic plan was obtained. Details are as follows.</p>
<p>Distributed by the Food Adjustment Committee</p>
<p>Regarding the rice from three provinces and two municipalities, it has been decided that after the Rice Control Association purchases it, the Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee will be responsible for receiving and distributing the supply to the five million residents of Shanghai, including major industrial organizations in Shanghai, friendly nations, and residents of the Zhoushan Islands area. The Food Rationing Adjustment Committee will negotiate with the China Rice Rationing Association for the food supply previously provided by the Rice Control Association, and the association will also pay the rice costs on its behalf. The packaging materials required for the transportation of food will be the responsibility of the Adjustment Committee.</p>
<p>Close Technical Cooperation</p>
<p>The two associations also carefully discussed technical methods and decided that the quantity and type of food to be supplied to the Adjustment Committee each month, as well as the delivery locations and prices, should be notified by the Rice Control Association to the Adjustment Committee before the 20th of the previous month to allow for advance preparation. At the same time, it was stipulated that the Adjustment Committee should notify the Rice Control Association of the rationing plan for the following month and the actual performance of the previous month before the 10th of each month. The close cooperation between the two associations will make Shanghai's food supply increasingly stable.</p>
<p>Monthly Quantity Increased to Six Sheng</p>
<p>In recent months, the amount of rice rationed to each person in the city has only been one sheng per period, which Shanghai residents have found insufficient. Although the authorities have increased the amount of flour to supplement rationing, residents are accustomed to eating rice and find flour-based foods inconvenient. The cooperation between the Shanghai Food Rationing Adjustment Committee and the Rice Control Association will gradually increase the amount of rice rationed to each person per month to more than six sheng in the short term. From now on, residents can be free from worries about food, and black market rice prices should fall dramatically. It is estimated that Shanghai needs approximately 230,000 bags of rice per month.</p>
<p>Yuan to Visit Nanjing to Negotiate Unified Distribution</p>
<p>Yuan Wendeng, Chairman of the Rice Control Committee, accompanied by advisor Mamoru Yamato and Pan Jinghe, Li Shanzhen, and others, took the night train to Nanjing yesterday to attend the material control review meeting to be held at 3 pm on the 30th and will also visit relevant authorities in Nanjing to earnestly request unified purchase and distribution of rice. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters: The Rice Control Committee's work of purchasing rice in various regions of the three provinces has entered the implementation stage. Branch offices have been formally established in various regions to purchase rice in accordance with established policies. Yuan's visit to Nanjing is to report and request instructions from the Nanjing authorities and to request the assistance of relevant parties to ensure the smooth progress of the grain control work. Yuan will stay in Nanjing for a short time and is expected to return to Shanghai in two or three days. Further reports say that the material control review meeting to be held in Nanjing will not only discuss the new grain control mechanism but also review the oil and grain transportation and distribution plan and the cotton purchase and distribution plan submitted by the Oil and Grain Professional Committee and the Cotton Professional Department of the Commercial Control Association. It is expected to be passed and implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>First District Economic Office Carries Out Special Investigation; Intensifies Investigation of Illegal Merchants</h3>
<p>The Economic Office of the First District Public Office of this city has decided to intensify its efforts to crack down on merchants and civilians who violate the economic regulations promulgated by the municipal authorities. Yesterday, a person in charge of the office told a Commercial News Agency reporter: Although the authorities have been making every effort to investigate merchants who hoard goods or engage in other illegal activities, some cunning merchants are still trying to survive by carrying out limited activities under strict laws. The authorities have decided to severely punish such merchants. The office has dispatched a large number of investigators to conduct special investigations in various places to investigate the prices and hoarding of major and minor commodities. Whether it is a manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, or any private individual, if there is suspicion of hoarding, they will be detained and dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>Investigation Targets</p>
<p>The investigators of the office have rich social experience and knowledge. They carry identity documents when performing their duties. The targets of the investigation are generally: Whether stores are hiding goods and refusing to sell them; selling goods above the price limit or increasing prices without approval; not marking prices on goods in the store; not issuing invoices or not recording them in the ledger when selling goods; moving goods privately without a permit; whether retail stores are participating in black market transactions; whether stores are adulterating or shortchanging the weight; and whether they are using substandard weights and measures.</p>
<p>Supervising Associations</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Economic Group Management Section of the Economic Office has reorganized all the major and minor associations in the city. Many new associations have also been established. Each association is now actively carrying out its affairs. In order to ensure that the affairs of each association are carried out effectively, the section has decided to further supervise the associations and also help them solve their difficulties.</p>

All yarn and cloth manufacturers and holders of yarn and cloth stored in the Shanghai urban area have applied for sale as scheduled. The quality and price of all purchased yarn and cloth have been jointly verified by the Chinese and Japanese verification committees organized by the office, and the prices of various cotton yarns, white cotton cloths, and processed cotton cloths have been verified based on the announced price of 10,000 yuan for 20-count Blue Phoenix brand from the Executive Yuan. The prices have been verified and sent to the General Chamber of Commerce for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval.

The actual work of the institute is overseen by Vice President Dong Bin, Director Feng Sen, and Secretary Jiang Tianyou. The Director is in charge of the Education and Teaching Affairs Department, which has a separate Children's Treatment Guidance Committee. The Affairs Department has a separate Children's Nurturing Research Committee. In terms of school affairs, there are divisions for teaching, student records, guardianship, statistics, library accounting, documentation, general affairs, sanitation, supply, and storage. The organizational division of labor appears to be quite meticulous, but the actual teaching staff, including the head teacher, numbers only thirteen. They cooperate and help each other, managing extremely complex and arduous tasks with a minimal number of people. Their compensation is also very meager, with the highest monthly salary being only 315 yuan and the lowest only 225 yuan, with simple accommodation provided. Their meals are no different from those of the students, consisting of simple vegetarian fare. They sacrifice themselves to serve, without diminishing their spirit of contentment. In order to continuously review their work and improve the education and nurturing of stray and distressed children, the teachers and staff devote their energy to improvement on a regular basis. They hold an Institute Affairs Meeting and a Life Review Meeting once a week, where they openly review and discuss matters in order to develop their work. They express satisfaction with their work and always seek criticism and guidance from others. It is precisely because the staff is so enthusiastic and hardworking that they have achieved such remarkable results in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>However, the Shanghai Fuyou Institute has always faced financial difficulties. Last year, it was fortunate to receive donations of over 260,000 yuan, which allowed it to barely maintain operations. This year, prices are several times higher than in previous years, the cost of living has skyrocketed, and the cost of supplies has increased accordingly. The difficult situation is not hard to imagine. In the spring of this year, they requested subsidies from the Shanghai Poverty and Sickness Relief Association. The Association's review committee members, Mr. Yao Huiquan and Mr. Li Wenwei, went to investigate and concluded that "the management situation is quite good, but financially it is currently running a deficit, and the collection of donations by the office is not very enthusiastic." Consequently, it was decided to subsidize 30,000 yuan, to be paid in three installments in January, March, and May. It was also suggested that there were many vacant spaces within the institute, and if the dormitories and classrooms were not separated, it would be possible to accommodate about 200 more street children, which would greatly benefit the cause of educating and nurturing distressed children. This suggestion was also accepted by the administrators of the Fuyou Institute. However, due to the continuous rise in prices and expenditures exceeding the budget, all plans could not be completed smoothly. The second fundraising campaign held in the spring had a target of 400,000 yuan to cover the regular educational and nurturing expenses for the end of the year. The results exceeded the set target, enabling the institute's operations to be maintained and improved. However, expanding the number of stray children being educated is said to be difficult at present, because the food expenses for the current 200-plus children (including food and fuel) already require a minimum of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per month. Clothing and education expenses are not even included in that figure. The majority of the funds raised previously have already been used to purchase food, fuel, and winter necessities such as cotton quilts. Therefore, it is said that the current daily expenses are already being covered by borrowing.</p>
<p>Leaving this paradise for 228 stray children and returning to the prosperous and bustling society, one still sees grimy beggar children crawling on the bustling streets and under towering buildings, and one still hears the cries of stray children. What crime have these children committed to deserve such a fate? This makes one all the more appreciative of the valuable work of institutions like the Fuyou Institute. However, they are also looking forward to the support of society. (The End)</p>
<h3>The Prime Suspect in the Assassination of Nanhui's Captain Yokota Arrested in Shanghai; Su Zhaofu and Eight Others Detained</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The Shanghai Security Bureau's Investigation Team, acting on information received on October 20th, learned that Su Zhaofu and Liao Xuehong, the prime suspects in the October 5th assassination of Allied Forces Captain Yokota in Nanhui's Shashan Township, were hiding in Room 5 of the Laozhongyu Inn at the intersection of Xinqing Road and Changshou Road in the city. It was also learned that they had acquired a handgun belonging to the slain Captain Yokota in mid-October, and had robbed a noodle shop owned by a Mr. Zhu in Yangjiaqiao, as well as a residence in northern Shanghai, and had divided the loot.</p>
<p>Prime Suspect Apprehended</p>
<p>The team leader, after receiving the report, immediately dispatched Deputy Team Leader Yu Baolin, First Squad Leader Zhang Xuechang, Squad Leader Gao Xiuhe, and the informant to the location. They coordinated with officers from the Putuo District Police Department and apprehended the suspects Su Zhaofu, Ding Xuehong, and the thieves Pan Yongqing, Xia Zhaoxiang, Luo Youliang, Sun Daoyuan, as well as suspects Wang and Sun Zou, a total of eight people. They also recovered Captain Yokota's 7.63-caliber handgun, serial number 7619, and five bullets, which had been hidden in the mud beside Sun Zou's boat. The suspects were handed over to the Investigation Section for further interrogation. During interrogation, Su Zhaofu and Ding Xuehong confessed that at around 7 p.m. on October 5th, they and seven others, including the fugitives Jiang Weihan and Sun Laowu, took a small boat to Shashan, claiming to be guerrillas soliciting donations from the village head.</p>
<p>Assassination of Yokota</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, they encountered three Japanese plainclothes officers. Believing they were targets, Sun Laowu, with his Mauser C96 pistol, shot and killed one of the Japanese officers (Captain Yokota). Su Zhaofu then seized the Japanese officer's handgun. Together with Ding Xuehong, Pan Yongqing, and the fugitives Yang Haibo, Tian Heshang, Jiang Weihan, and Hua Ermazi, they used the stolen handgun to rob a grain store owned by Zhu Qibiao in Yangjiaqiao on the night of October 17th, taking 10,400 yuan in cash, a gold ring, and clothing. They also stole items from a household, which they divided among themselves.</p>
<p>Using the Loot</p>
<p>The suspects Pan Yongqing and Sun Daoyuan confessed that they received 500 yuan and 300 yuan respectively from Su Zhaofu as proceeds from the crime, which they spent. Luo Youliang confessed that Su Zhaofu had hidden the crime weapon in his house. Xia Zhaoxiang, however, was cunning and refused to confess to any robbery, claiming he was merely passing by when he was arrested. The suspect Yang Wu, a prostitute, stated that she was introduced to Su Zhaofu by a tea server named Shi from the inn. Sun Zou stated that Ding Xuehong forcibly took the handgun from Luo Youliang's house and hid it in the boat. She did not participate and Ding Xuehong moved it to the mud on the bank of the river next to the boat. The case is still under thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief Funds for North China; Efforts Made to Expedite Remittances; Charity Sales of Paintings, Calligraphy, and Antiques</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles North China Emergency Relief Association convened its eleventh executive board meeting at 4 p.m. yesterday at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Attendees included Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Li Sihao, Zhang Yunbo, Yao Lingxiang, Chen Binhe, Sun Mingqi, Hu Qiqi, and Zhao Jinqing. The meeting was chaired by Wen Lanting, and Yu Jiyu served as the secretary.</p>
<p>Report on Association Affairs</p>
<p>(A) Reports: 1. A letter was sent to Director Sun, as per the decision of the tenth executive board meeting, requesting that he forward a request to Minister Ding to allocate the 10 million yuan pledged by Mr. Sheng Youyi before the association's closure at the end of October, in order to complete the procedures and benefit the disaster victims. 2. A reply was sent to Committee Member Fu Qiangeng, stating that, as the grain relief efforts had been ongoing for a long time, the sacks were damaged, and efforts should be made to repair and replace them. 3. On October 14th, personnel were sent to the Flour and Wheat Special Committee to inquire about 680 bags of Red Goldfish Brand No. 4 flour donated to the association and stored at the Dashengchang Mill at the North Gate of Chang'an Bridge in Wuxi. Upon verification, it was confirmed that the flour was indeed there. Therefore, it is still necessary to process the export permit for the materials to facilitate their transport north. 4. On October 22nd, the association paid 8,744.80 yuan for the provincial tax, the Chamber of Commerce handling fee, and the military tax (12.86 yuan per bag) for the 680 bags of Red Goldfish Brand No. 4 flour. 5. On October 22nd, all account books and receipts from the Jinshi Painting and Fan Exhibition were submitted to the audit team for review. The team instructed the exhibition to provide the original receipts. In addition to the 2,932.60 yuan in cash and checks received, 161,000 yuan remained in the Tobacco Industry Bank and was transferred to the Bank of Communications for safekeeping. Receipt No. 5182 was obtained and handed over to the exhibition. 6. On October 26th, a request was made for the issuance of a permit for the second batch of relief grain shipments. The Chamber of Commerce waived the handling fee of one-tenth of one percent, amounting to 38,979.50 yuan. A letter has been sent requesting the refund of the 7,520 yuan handling fee for the first batch of relief grain shipments to be transported north, in order to report and ensure consistency.</p>
<p>Resolutions (B) Discussion: It was previously resolved to allocate 4 million yuan in cash, with 800,000 yuan each to the provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, to be distributed by the respective provincial governments, and 400,000 yuan each to the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, to be distributed by the Red Swastika Society. However, as the grain accounts have not yet been settled, it is proposed to retain the 800,000 yuan for Beijing and Tianjin and remit the 800,000 yuan to each of the four provinces first. However, the only bank currently capable of remitting funds to North China is the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the amount that can be remitted is limited. However, remittances can be made to Beijing, Tianjin, and Jinan. There is still no way to remit funds to Henan and Shanxi. How should this situation be handled? Please decide on this matter. It was resolved to first pay 800,000 yuan each to Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, and 310,000 yuan each to Beijing and Tianjin, and find ways to remit the funds. Paintings, calligraphy, antiques, wine, and furs have all been appraised. It was proposed to display them at the Ningbo Native Place Association for three days for charity sales. Is this feasible? Please decide on this matter. It was resolved not to display them and to sell them separately through charity sales. (C) Ad Hoc Motion: It was previously decided at a meeting to borrow 1 million yuan for disaster relief in Anhui. Due to the fact that it will take time to collect the funds donated by Mr. Youyi, the aforementioned borrowed funds should be disbursed immediately.</p>

These two connections have been completed, and in the future, the company will do its best to supply most of the electricity needed by the former French Concession.</p>
<h3>Monks From Various Countries Gather in Shanghai to Participate in Memorial Service</h3>
<p>The Great East Asia Memorial Service is about to open.

In order to ensure the cleanliness and solemnity of the venue, the organizers of the service have announced that attendees will not be allowed to bring any items inside, including incense, candles, and joss paper. These items will be provided by the service for purchase.</p>

<p>Yesterday's News Time: 7:10 PM</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Pain of Unemployment</h3>
<p>The German News Agency quoted a New Delhi dispatch yesterday, commenting on the impression given by the Indian Governor's first public statement: "Seeing a poverty-stricken and semi-naked nation seeking a night's sleep, waiting for the next day's hardships and starvation." These words describe the state of famine in India. However, we believe they can be borrowed to describe the pain of unemployment in Shanghai, and this would not be inappropriate. The hunger and suffering of the countless helpless poor people wandering the streets of this city are all due to unemployment, and the greatest cause of unemployment is still the war. Since the outbreak of war, factories have successively closed or reduced their operations. It is not only the working class, but also skilled technicians who are forced to find no means of making a living, ending up wandering the streets or even waiting for death. This situation has become a widespread phenomenon throughout the country, not just in a corner of Shanghai. This is precisely the economic problem of the entire society discussed yesterday, which must not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Since the Allied nations returned various factories, and since all parties are actively restoring various production activities, the pain of unemployment in society may be partially alleviated. Originally, increasing production depends on the simultaneous concentration of manpower and material resources. On the one hand, the country is calling for increased production, and on the other hand, it cannot sit idly by and watch the people's unemployment, because these two things are as interdependent as lips and teeth. The Job Introduction Section of the Social Welfare Department of the First District Public Office of this city began registering unemployed people in December 1942, starting with technical personnel. Since August of this year, they have been providing job introductions for ordinary talents. If such work can be expanded and promoted by the state's governing bodies and assisted by public social organizations, it will be of great help to the poverty of society and the production of the country. It is truly profound and mutually beneficial!</p>
<h3>After the First Phase of Wheat Allocation, Flour Mills Are Working Overtime; Second Phase of Procurement About to Begin</h3>
<p>The first phase of wheat procurement for this year has concluded. The target of 2 million bags has been fully achieved. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee has allocated the wheat to flour mills in various locations. Yesterday, it was learned that the flour mills near the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have been producing flour continuously since receiving the allocated wheat, and the situation is extremely tight. In order to implement the previously established flour and bran allocation plan as soon as possible, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has urged the mills to step up their work. The larger mills have increased their nighttime shifts, and the mills that had been shut down due to the incident have resumed operations.</p>
<p>A Portion of the Flour Exchanged for Materials</p>
<p>In addition to supplying flour produced by the mills to various provinces in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Committee Chairman Sun Zhongli and Vice Chairman Inoue Yasutada of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee have consulted with the authorities in North China regarding the quantity to be transported north and transportation issues. Specific measures have been agreed upon, and it is reported that a portion of the flour is already en route to the north.</p>
<p>Preparing to Commence the Second Phase of Procurement</p>
<p>After the completion of the first phase of wheat procurement, the second phase of procurement will follow. Based on the experience of the first phase, the second phase is expected to be even more successful. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee will send personnel to the branch offices in various regions to inspect and improve any shortcomings in business and technology.</p>
<p>Various Industries Request Increased Allocation</p>
<p>Since receiving the allocated flour, various industries in the city have been able to reduce costs. However, the allocated amount is often insufficient to meet actual needs, so they have requested an appropriate increase. The Special Committee acknowledges that this is indeed the case and will consider supplementary allocations. However, it has also been discovered that some parties are secretly trading the allocated flour on the black market. Therefore, the Committee will be even more rigorous in its review process. Once discovered, in addition to permanent suspension of allocation rights, the offenders will be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Material Control Review Committee to Convene Eighth Meeting</h3>
<p>The eighth meeting of the Material Control Review Committee, to which a Shanghai delegation is sending representatives to attend, is scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 30th at the Nanjing International Club. The main objective of this meeting is to review the procurement of essential materials such as cotton, oil, grain, tobacco, and medicine. The Shanghai delegates are Mr. Zha Nana and Mr. He Yuanji from the National General Chamber of Commerce for Unified Business Control, as well as Mr. Pan Liangxian, a specially appointed commissioner of the Material Control Review Committee.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Business Federation Handles Remittances From Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Business Federation was established last year by Overseas Chinese merchants in Shanghai, initiated by Guo Shun, Huang Kangquan, Li Ze, Hu Guigeng, Chen Shuilu, Zheng Zhaobin, Lin Chaopin, Hui Wanpu, Jing Yimen, and others. Its office is located at 354 Xingya Building on the Bund. Since its establishment, it has been making every effort to handle Overseas Chinese affairs and facilitate trade. The Federation believes that postal and shipping connections between Southeast Asia and Shanghai are of great importance. Although it has been less than a month since the resumption of these services, remittances from overseas to Shanghai have been increasing significantly. The Federation assigns committee members to handle the collection of funds at any time, with simple and expeditious procedures. All expenses are borne by all directors and supervisors of the Federation, and no fees are charged to external parties.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Ready to Open; Trial Trading to Begin</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, since holding its reopening ceremony on the 29th of last month, has now fully approved and announced its list of brokers. The Ministry of Industry has issued broker licenses, allowing them to pay their deposits and commence business in accordance with the law. The listing of Chinese stocks has also been reviewed one after another, and the market layout, such as the installation of telephone lines, has been completed. The detailed operating rules have been approved by the Ministry. Yesterday, it was learned that the exchange is ready for operation and will begin a trial trading period on November 3rd to train its employees. There will be no formal transactions with the public. Once the training is completed, the official opening date will be announced, which is expected to be in mid-December. It is also reported that the exchange's business will include: (1) spot trading of various securities; (2) forward trading of various securities. However, the reopening will temporarily only allow the spot trading of Chinese stocks, with settlement to be handled every Monday. Brokers are absolutely prohibited from manipulating market prices and other illegal activities, and violators will be punished in accordance with the business rules. The operation of the exchange will be governed by the exchange's articles of association, as well as the Exchange Law, the Company Law, and other relevant laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>City Grain Bureau Clarifies Nature of Native Liquor Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Special City Liquor Retailers Association and the fact that the scope of the Shanghai Native Liquor Vendors Association has not been clearly defined, the latter Association was concerned that disputes might easily arise. It therefore requested the City Grain Bureau to clarify the situation. The Bureau issued an order explaining: "The Native Liquor Vendors Association refers specifically to the vendors of Taixing native liquor who do not establish fixed business locations in Shanghai and operate on a mobile basis. Other types of liquor and liquor stores established in this city are not included. The establishment of the Association is in fact a unified organization for the sale of Taixing native liquor. The Bureau finds that it does not conflict with the Shanghai Special City Liquor Retailers Association. The Shanghai Special City Liquor Retailers Association shall continue to promote its affairs in accordance with its original charter."</p>
<h3>Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market trended towards stagnation. Overnight news from abroad was entirely priced in. Major players were unwilling to release their holdings. The volume of floating shares being sold off was quite limited. Furthermore, news of the stock exchange potentially resuming operations mid-next week stimulated investor confidence, and bargain hunting by substantial investors was not uncommon. Consequently, most stocks experienced a slight increase compared to their closing prices the previous day, with significant trading activity. A breakdown of various industry stocks for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company fluctuated but ultimately did not recover its initial position. Sincere and Sun Sun Department Stores both rose slightly. Innerwear prices saw a marginal increase compared to the previous day. The Wing On and Kwong Wah Department Stores saw gains of approximately 10%. Textiles: Wing On Textiles experienced slight fluctuations, while both Meyer and Asia factories remained stable. Yung Shing saw a slight decrease in trading volume, while China Textiles continued to decline slightly. Sinwo remained stable, while Taikong and Tian Lun showed strength. Mei Lun and New Fueng Lun were supported by buyers. King Fook Hosiery and King Lun both saw minor increases, while China Silk continued to decline.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals: New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory saw slight ups and downs but ultimately trended upwards. Sino-French prices dropped slightly but remained generally stable. Five Continents, Sino-Western, New Star, and Chiu Foo Pharmaceutical all halted their declines and trended towards stability, while Sincere Pharmaceuticals experienced a decline.</p>
<p>Finance: Chekiang Industrial Bank saw some initial gains but gave back a portion. Trading volume in Shanghai was not high, and prices remained the same as the previous day. The buying price for Tientsin Native Bank, Kin Cheng, and Salt Industry remained the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Culture: World Book Company saw slightly lower trading prices both domestically and internationally. Commercial Press and Chung Hwa remained stable.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Yung Hsing Real Estate saw considerable initial trading activity, exceeding its face value outside of the foreign concessions. Prices rose in the afternoon. Lien Hwa and New Yi Real Estate saw a decline.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Chapei Water &amp; Electric and China General Edison Company remained idle at their quoted prices, showing a potential for a break.</p>
<p>Industry: The decline of Great China Match continued unabated. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company saw trading activity within the foreign concessions. Chiu An Industry alone remained stable. New Asia Construction fluctuated at one times its face value. China and Kwok Wah Investment remained stable. Hong Yuan Confectionery regressed and entered the foreign concessions. Ta Tung Trading also showed weakness. Three Joy and Hing Wah were offered within face value but lacked buyers, especially the latter. Great China Industrial remained relatively stable. Mee Lun Confectionery and Kwong Sang Hong also showed weakness and declined. Standard Monosodium Glutamate continued to trade at a high of 65%.</p>
<p>The first edition of the "Pocket-Sized Chinese Stock Guide" has been reprinted due to large-scale distribution to subscribers in recent days and enthusiastic purchases from various parties, leaving few copies remaining. Starting today, exclusive distribution will be handled by the Enterprise Weekly, located at 996 Jingan Temple Road (Mee Lun Building at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road).</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Government bonds suddenly underwent changes yesterday due to excessive speculation in futures, which was expected. This caused widespread unease, leading to widespread selling, causing prices to plummet. Consequently, all transactions were being closed out, and brokers were preoccupied with these trades. Therefore, there was no time for other instruments. Since deals were only for closing positions, spot trading naturally became neglected. Category C bonds fell sharply at the beginning of trading yesterday, and gradually declined, eventually falling twenty points more than the previous day. No one asked about other bonds.</p>
<p>Interbank Loan Rate: The Interbank Loan Rate of the Bankers Association remained unchanged at 1.2%.</p>
<p>Grains: Grain prices continued to be high yesterday. Rice prices rose because the Rice Control Association had begun procuring from various producing areas, leading to a gradual decrease in free trade. Prices rose due to reduced supply, eventually approaching two large denominations. Oilseed prices also tended to be firm.</p>

<h3>Dialogue on the Resolution of the People's War and Germany and Japan's Awakening with Tokutomi Sohō and Honda Kumataro</h3>
<p>In this way, a transformation has occurred. Although this war has been going on for four years, since the disastrous defeat at Dunkirk three years ago, it has only been able to defend itself with the help of the United States. Here, the United States is clearly dealing with the war with two minds. One is to defeat Japan in this war, and the other is that everyone has known for the past seven or eight years that the United States thought it could control the world. Many books have been published that bluntly state that the United States should control the world, while on the other hand, because Britain is protecting itself, it is unclear whether it is willing to do anything. We often hear British generals say that only with the help of the United States can peace be ensured in all parts of the world. In this way, the desire to control the world has been aroused among Americans. Since Britain expressed its dependence on the United States, until Roosevelt became President in 1932, he implemented a new economic policy, which came at a very high cost. A lot of national funds were used, but ten million people remained unemployed.</p>
<p>Therefore, Roosevelt felt the need to shift people's attention abroad, and that was to start a major war, and the desire of the people to create a new world. Not to mention the navy, even among the intellectual class, it has risen. However, in Europe, unfortunately, because of the rise of Germany, Britain is at its wit's end. So Roosevelt wanted to play a good show. The following year after the Manchurian Incident, Ambassador Grew telegraphed to the country from Tokyo, warning that "Germany in the West and Japan in the East are planning to dominate the world," and to actively view them as evil-doers who will threaten the United States itself. The European war was challenged by the United States aiding Britain and France against Germany. After the defeat of the Norwegian campaign before the disastrous defeat at Dunkirk, Chamberlain stepped down and Churchill came to power. At the same time, Britain also suffered tragic conditions. When Churchill became Prime Minister, he decided on two major policies for carrying out the war.</p>
<p>First, in this war, it may not be possible to regain control like the previous time. Therefore, in order to avoid defeat before winning, abandon everything and utilize the United States. Therefore, it is willing to sacrifice national dignity and national glory, mobilize the United States, and use American power to compete with the Axis powers. The other is to hand over the domestic political leadership to the Labour Party. Millions of troops and millions of laborers are controlled by the working class. Only under this premise can the domestic political leadership be handed over to the Labour Party. As for foreign policy, regardless of everything, concentrate on relying on and utilizing everything in the United States. These are the two major policies set by Churchill. After the start of the war, the Soviet Union was also used. Therefore, Britain has been fighting with the strength of others from the beginning. However, the United States believes that this world war is, in a certain sense, a war of inheritance of the British Empire. There are three expected successors to this British Empire: Germany in Europe, Japan in the Pacific, and the United States in the Atlantic. Then the competition for determining the scope of each labor force can also be established. The British Empire is gradually shrinking. Willkie of the United States uttered wild words recklessly, and Churchill expressed his indignation and anger, saying: "I am not doing the liquidator of the British Empire." The United States has troops stationed in important places within the territory of the British Empire, and has gradually sent troops to all properties that can be regarded as assets. In this way, the war waged by Britain is a war of political intent, a war of political nature, not a war for survival like ours.</p>
<p>Britain has been fighting for four years. The recent battle situation is surprisingly advantageous, but that is thanks to the United States. Therefore, it has aroused the American desire to inherit the legacy. In Africa, the United States has built semi-permanent airfields, Iran has American troops stationed there, and there are also American troops in Iceland. The United States probably intends to use Ceylon. That being said, the British naturally hope that the war will end sooner rather than later. If the war continues to drag on, even if they win, it will not be Britain's victory, but America's. As a result, Britain fears that it will become a state of America. Isn't Britain harboring this fear? Then, in our position, even though we are suffering, we should resist to the end and defeat them. Italy has already been deceived and surrendered by Britain and the United States, and as a result, the independent country of Italy has also perished.</p>
<p>We suffer on this side, and of course the other side also suffers. Such a big war, of course, has its ups and downs (to be continued). (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, October 19)</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Coal Briquette Control</h3>
<p>— By Mr. Zhang</p>
<p>In present-day Shanghai, coal briquettes are indeed an indispensable fuel. They are cheaper than charcoal and more convenient than firewood. As such, residents who use coal briquettes as fuel account for nearly 85% of the city's population. This startling figure further proves the critical role coal briquettes play among fuels and the significant impact its production volume has on the safety and well-being of the city's residents!</p>
<p>Over the past month, the supply of coal briquettes has dwindled day by day, and the sense of panic has increased in tandem. Especially in recent days, citizens have faced the threat of running out of fuel, which, if prolonged, will greatly undermine public livelihood and stability. The root cause of this situation, without a doubt, is the decrease in coal dust allocated to coal briquette factories by the authorities. Meanwhile, the imperfect control system and the declining profits of manufacturers are also major reasons for the acute shortage of spot supply and the abnormally high black market prices.</p>
<p>Alleviating the suffering of the people and finding ways to bring the essential fuel, coal briquettes, to a state of balanced supply and demand is indeed a major issue that the authorities should urgently study and realize!</p>
<p>Increasing the allocation of coal dust to manufacturing plants will provide them with ample raw materials for producing briquettes. This will result in robust production, naturally balancing supply and demand, and the black market will disappear on its own, while the panic will subside without needing any medicine. However, the authorities have their own difficulties in reducing the allocation of coal dust. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities will adhere to the principles of "expanding sources and reducing expenditures," both by facilitating the sourcing of coal and by striving to conserve unnecessary and dispensable consumption, which will slightly aid the production of coal briquettes.</p>
<p>However, adjusting the coal briquette control mechanism and slightly increasing the profits of manufacturers are also issues worth noting.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of adjusting the coal briquette control mechanism, it is necessary to first understand its original organization, its development process, and the overview of the current organization. Only then can we examine the merits and demerits of the organizational structure and the imperfections of the current organization, and have a relatively appropriate improvement for future organizational adjustments.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the supply of coal briquettes has been similar to the present situation. It took the efforts of the authorities and Sino-Japanese coal companies to establish the following control mechanism:</p>
<p>The above chart shows the most complete organization of the control mechanism. At the beginning of its establishment, it was naturally incomplete and lacked coordination. The effectiveness of the control was, therefore, very limited. By the time it reached a complete state, although its effectiveness was not as satisfactory as ideal, the mission of control was still largely accomplished.</p>
<p>The detailed organizational procedures of the chart are now described below, so as to clarify the situation of the control at that time.</p>
<p>The China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board and the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council were parallel institutions, possessing the special authority to permit movement within the Shanghai area. The Coal Federation was an intermediary between the Asia Development Board and the coal briquette association, and the major Chinese coal companies. It had the power to review and approve the quantity of raw materials and roasted coal allocated to each coal briquette manufacturer each term, and to issue permits to the major companies. Therefore, in reality, the Coal Federation exercised the major power of allocation. The first department of the Coal Briquette Association was composed of Japanese manufacturers, while the second department was jointly formed by 29 large and small Chinese manufacturers in Shanghai. The organization of the first department involved fewer livelihood-related matters and will not be discussed for the time being. As for the second department, its work mainly consisted of conveying orders from the authorities and investigating the monthly production, sales, and inventory quantities of each factory. The major Chinese coal companies were composed of more than ten coal companies. Its mission was merely to purchase allocated quantities from the Japanese Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Iwai &amp; Co. and sell them to coal briquette manufacturers, collecting commissions. As for the responsibilities of the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in addition to mobility permits, its main tasks also included issuing business licenses to small vendors and secretly investigating price changes.</p>
<p>At that time, the permit for raw materials issued by the Asia Development Board to manufacturers was valid for ten days, allowing transport from Japanese coal depots in Pudong to the designated coal briquette factories. The permit for small vendors to transport coal briquettes from factories to shops was valid for one month. It remained in use in the early days of the Asia Development Board's restructuring (into the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai).</p>
<p>The responsible person for the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council was Mr. Duifg, and the person in charge of coal briquette control affairs was Mr. Cornwell. There were two types of permits issued by the Committee: one was a Customer Permit, valid for one month, used for transporting briquettes from factories to small vendors; the other was a Picul Permit, valid for 24 hours, used for factories to deliver directly to designated customers.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, due to the abundance of briquette manufacturing materials, the production of coal briquettes was in a state of oversupply. In view of this, the authorities gradually cancelled all of the above permits, making the materials free to move.</p>
<p>As for the current organization, apart from the Coal Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council which has long been cancelled, the rest remains the same as before.</p>
<p>The above is an outline of the control mechanism. Although the allocation of raw materials still has to be determined by the Coal Federation, the movement of coal and coal briquettes is a free policy. The cause of this black market and shortage lies here.</p>
<p>Regarding the profits of coal briquette manufacturers, according to the cost table formulated by the Second Department of the Coal Briquette Association in April of this year, the distribution is as follows: Raw material cost: Raw material coal: 307.89 yuan, Coal dust: 69.42 yuan, Transportation and shortage: 21.00 yuan, Yellow mud: 8.00 yuan, Expense costs: Roasting coal: 35.00 yuan, Water and electricity: 8.00 yuan, Labor and meals: 25.00 yuan, Interest: 8.00 yuan, Repair and depreciation: 46.00 yuan, Office expenses: 27.00 yuan, Manufacturer's profit: 14.69 yuan, Total: 570.00 yuan. Note: The cost is based on per ton as the standard. According to the above table, (in April) if the manufacturer sells at a wholesale price of 570 yuan per ton, it can obtain a net profit of 14 yuan and 69 cents. Currently, the wholesale price of the same industry is 550 yuan. Although the price of allocated raw materials is cheaper than before, the increase in transportation costs, coal ash, raw mud, and cost of expenses directly affect the increase in manufacturing costs, which indirectly affects the reduction of profits. In Shanghai, where the cost of living is high, who would be willing to invest in this low-profit industry? Therefore, general manufacturers secretly sell the raw materials used to make coal briquettes at high prices to seek huge profits. In this way, the output of coal briquettes is, of course, reduced.</p>
<p>As for small vendors, they purchase from manufacturers at 550 yuan per ton, plus transportation and other expenses. Then, what is the net profit they get when they sell to customers at 650 yuan per ton? What's more, recently, various manufacturers have been adding other expenses under different names – in this way, is the creation of a black market inevitable?</p>
<p>Recently, the Materials Control Office has been sending personnel to investigate and eliminate the black market. However, I believe that this is not a fundamental solution. On the contrary, it will cause the supply to be even more lacking.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that the authorities will, on the one hand, slightly increase prices to enable manufacturers to obtain legitimate profits, and at the same time strengthen the control of various manufacturing plants, so that the allocated coal and the quantity of production and sales form a regulated proportion. In this way, manufacturers will obtain considerable profits and, given the strict control of the authorities, will not be able to carry out their tricks and secretly sell coal. With more raw materials, production will naturally increase, and the black market will disappear without being suppressed. However, this is a relatively easy rescue method to implement at present. As for the most complete system, of course, it still depends on the authorities' urgent implementation of the rationing system.</p>

<h3>Wanghailou Layman Donates Free Hospital Beds for Teachers</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, teachers lead simple and often impoverished lives, and when they fall ill, they often lack the means for treatment. I deeply sympathize with the aim of the [organization] to assist teachers, and establish a medical aid fund. As a responsible physician, I should provide assistance. I have specially secured three free hospital beds for teachers at the Fotuang Sanatorium with the consent of the said sanatorium. It is known that the sanatorium is compassionate and takes Buddha's teachings to heart, and its wards are inexpensive. The sanatorium provides daily examinations and medicine. Teachers who are ill due to heat or cold and are unable to afford medical treatment and need hospitalization can be admitted for treatment with a certificate from your [organization]. I will bear all hospitalization and medical expenses. However, other illnesses will not be accepted. The sanatorium is located at 123 Rue Massenet, Wanghailou Layman.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Madam Wu, Mother of Wu</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wu Minfang, a member of the board of directors of the Lianyi Volunteer Primary School, held a banquet at the hall of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to entertain friends from all walks of life in celebration of his mother, Madam Wu, on her sixtieth birthday. Ms. Wu has served society and youth for many years and is particularly enthusiastic about charitable causes. On this day, gifts and donations were presented from all sides. Upon the initiative of Madam Wu and Ms. Wu, all were donated to charity. In addition to donating to various charitable organizations, they specifically donated 10,000 yuan as the school's operating funds to benefit the poor.</p>

<p>Correction</p>
<p>Regarding a news item in the Social Services section of your newspaper on the 27th of this month concerning a scam targeting those offering houses for rent, it was stated that Zhang Tiemin was spreading rumors in the name of our company and stealing leather cases, etc. After investigation, our company has no such person, and the telephone number he provided, 90647, is inconsistent with the facts. To avoid misunderstandings, we request that the information be corrected. Hui Li Stock Company, October 27.</p>
