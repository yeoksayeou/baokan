<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">爲目前政局　我們所希望於日本朝野者 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我們連日申論國民政府强化政治地位，對內必須完成全面和平，從把握和平區內人民業已轉變傾向的心理，而益發使之堅定信念，同時，藉此解放重慶政權統治下大多數被桎梏的同胞，使之和我們站在一起，孤立重慶少數人把住的依賴英美的政權，使之無法繼續拖戰。然後增强我們對日本的協力，共同進向擊滅英美之途，而及早完成勝利的任務。因此，我們提出「民間輿論」與「人民參政」是促進修明政治及强化政治地位的兩大力量，盼望政府誠意接受，予以發展。我們自信這種論斷的產生，並不是囿於一時的靑感作用，或是代表某種立塲。我門根據民間各方面的意向，參以中國人民特有的性格，以及歷史上的敎訓，而用客觀的理智的態度爲基礎，加以分析，加以理解，成爲一貫的言論。</p>
<p>因爲人們見仁見智的不同，利害關係的不同，同時，我們爲了強調論斷也覺得言論上或有亢直率眞之處，願以「君子聞過則喜」的態度，期待於重視輿論的當局。</p>
<p>們對於政府的期待，自當隨時獻言。今天更想就日來討論的問題，對友邦日本朝野，基於中日協力的根本觀點，敷陳我們的見解如次：</p>
<p>第一，我們所要問的，到目前爲止，日本與中國協力的，是那一些人？或是那一些　門？如果協力的是某些階層的人，澈底的說，是中國的官塲中的人，那末，「協力」的結一果，絕對不會有如想像中的成效。更不幸的，如果「協力」的是腐敗　官僚政客以及土豪劣紳，或是掛羊頭賣狗肉的機關團體，那末，不但沒有好的反　，反而「協力」得愈緊密，中國人民愈痛苦。我們說這個話，當然不是指「協力」爲有害，而是指「協力」對象的選擇的重要性，如果「協力」的對象正確，這「協力」愈緊密，愈能收實效。我們認爲最正確的協力的對象，就是中國廣大多教的人民。這裏，當然也不是說日本應與每一個中國人民去協力，而是說能夠代表大多數人民意向與利益的一些人，一些部門，包括政府的賢明官吏，地方的公正士紳，廉潔的政治機構，正當的人民團體。我們更鄭重的告訴友邦人士，要了解中國，必須先了解人民意向；要認識政府，更必須先認識人民意向。有了這種最根本的了解和認識，才能選擇協力的正確對象，才能收到協力的預期成效。</p>
<p>第二，日本對華政策的轉變，其實質當在幫助中國進向自主獨立之途，强化國民政府地位，協力完成對英美作戰的勝利，共同担負建立大東亞共榮圈的任務，期待之殷，倚畀之誠，中國人民自會了解。可是，中國人民十年以來，旦夕所希望日本的轉變對華政策，居然一旦實現，這是最可欣幸的事。可是一般人民都重視現實的，尤其是中國人民的敎育程度淺而不齊，對於一切政治上的好聽名詞或遠大的政治理想，不容易感到什麼興趣。只問友邦日本政變對華新政策之前之後，人民方面實際上所受到的有何兩樣？換句話說：如果日本的對華新政策。只有少數人感到興趣，那末，大多數的老百姓就會感到失望。所以，我們認爲如更能完全以中國人民所需要的爲對象的轉變，就更能收到比目前加倍效果的協力。這個理由，深信友邦人士頗有熟悉中國情形，和關心中國民間輿論者，已經很明瞭，而毋須重加闡釋了。</p>
<p>第三，「中國問題，必須由大多數中國人民自己來解決的。」這點，凡對中國情形熟悉的友邦人士，都已有同一的感覺。因爲中國的任何黨派，在人民中都不過佔絕少數的。目前的南京國民政府，固是領導中國人民復興建國的唯一政府。同時，不可諱言的還有負嵎西南的重慶政權，及頑據西北的共產黨，中國在形式上有三種人民，可是實質上還都是「中國人民」，畢竟會歸致於一統的意向。也就是說形式上雖然分成三種人民，他們只等待着選擇一個能代表他們意向的政府，都將集中於一個以國家和人民利益爲前提的政府統治之下。換句話說，現在南京國民政府把握住了中國人民渴求和平的心理，把握住了中國人民反英美帝國主義侵華的夙願，如果能由主張而達到實踐，那末很自然的會使渝共區內的人民心理一致歸向。所以，友邦人士的對華政策，以人民意向爲對象，就是直接强化國民政府最有效的方向。</p>
<p>第四，和平區內人民，心理上已不如重慶政權治下的紛亂，更無政治上的派別。我們昨天已詳細論列和平區內人民心理，對於和平運動，已從無可無不可的觀點，變爲可能成功的認識和信念。所以，今天和平區內的人民心理，已歸一致，祗要能夠把握這點，而使信念益趨堅定，那末，擁護政府政策推行，決無問題。所以今日和平區內的民間輿論，只有關心政府，督促政府，以期政治上軌道的誠意。這是大多數人民的意向，並無絲毫派別之爭可言。</p>
<p>歸納言之，中國人民的意向，終極必歸趨一致。目前和平區內人民的意向，已經是一致於認識和運，接受和運，只要政府的政治修明，能夠配合這意向，那末，渝共治下的人民意向，必將趨附一致，也就是全面和平的成功。所以，深盼友邦人士，在中　協力的原則下，認淸這「人民意向」的重要；同時，認淸這意向的一單純」「一致」，而決定「正確協力」的對象，以收事半功倍之效。</p>

<p>斯德哥爾摩三日中央社電　據比利斯本消息：澳洲陸長福特星期日晚在招待報界時警吿稱，「如聯合國家不正確運用其戰略，則澳洲或將遭蹂躪。」渠敦促反軸心國派遣更多之軍隊飛機及供應至澳洲，渠稱，「余坦然吿訴諸君，吾人仍有受日本攻擊之眞性危險。」渠又言日本巳增加其潛艇之實力，以圖截斷澳洲之交通綫云。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電　據新金山來電：西南太平洋反軸心空軍司令官凱尼，前曾赴華盛頓要求美政府及軍方首腦加强對澳洲之援助，茲剴尼已歸任，頃就太平洋方面反軸心空軍勢力薄弱之情形談稱，反軸心空軍即欲補充一架飛機，亦需相當時間，故其數量上實　遜於日本空軍，因此吾人遂亦陷於窮境云。在此可知凱尼此次訪美使命已歸失敗，而美國對澳援助亦難早日實現。</p>

<h3 id="c5">渝方楊傑稱述　日本戰力之威脅　日在太平洋地位益強固　呼籲反軸心國注意澳洲 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>廣州三日中央社電　渝方對於英美之堅持歐洲戰綫第一主義，前曾不斷加以抨擊，最近則又迭向美英力言危機，如素被推爲渝方第一戰略家之楊杰，於一日在渝掃蕩報發表論文，曾謂英美如再不採取何種對策，則日本在太平洋之地位，將益臻强固，明白指出所受日本戰力之威脅。其大意謂　，日本稱今年爲決戰年，刻正進行，可以決定太平洋運命之堅確準備，因此日本現似正積極建設南方佔領地域。決定太平洋戰爭之關鍵爲澳洲，如日本一經將澳洲及新西蘭征服，則雖在將來之數世紀問，亦斷難動搖日本在太平洋上之地位。如此反軸心國之對日戰略，不得不重加調整，且需要極長時問，始可擊潰日本，蓋澳洲一旦爲日本占領則日本不但巳非資源缺乏之國家，且將成爲資源充裕之國，縱應付任何長期戰爭，亦決不能稍動其毫髮。且日本現已將澳洲北方形成半圓形之重要島嶼，全部歸入勢力範圍，故澳洲實際巳被包圍。時至今日，反軸心國方面，實應重加反省，良機一失，勢將後悔莫及云。</p>

<p>凡是一件發明，斷非一朝一夕之功所能倖致，必須經過長時期的耐苦鍛鍊，窮畢生之力，然後方才有一點端倪可見！榮授陸軍技術有功章的大阪陸軍造不泯的眞理。照一氏出身於大阪府中河內郡長瀨村，卒業於該村的尋常小學校後，反對父母叫他去當學徒的主意，踏上了另一條路徑。</p>
<p>此後，曾輾轉就業於坂上貴金屬細工業，藤原齒科機械工業。日俄戰爭時，雖在奉天一役獲得大捷，但這是用人力去拚的，並不是由於兵器的力量所致。照一氏有鑒於日本兵器不足的實情，振奮了他年靑的情緒，乃毅然於三十八年四月進入當時的大阪砲兵工廠。</p>
<p>大阪砲兵工廠自與彈丸襲造所合併之後，似乎已開始製造彈丸的信管，信管在一圓鐵塊注入生命而變成彈丸，彈丸如其有了信管，可以洞穿數尺厚的鐵板，轉瞬間使人與物化爲灰燼。日俄之役，中日之役，日本用旺盛而強烈的精神力，巧妙地戰勝了敵的「物」力，可是日本的損害相當可觀，日軍死傷二十萬，俄軍死傷十四萬（俘虜八萬），日俄戰役中這偉大的犧牲，說明了日軍怎樣用血肉之軀，與持有優秀火器的敵人苦戰的情况。</p>
<p>假使日方亦有優秀的武器，則犧牲的數量或可大爲减少。因此，信管製造工的照一氏，甩全副精力來從事其工作，而成爲日本唯一的信管工在休假日，到別的工廠去，千方百計的要求到秘密工塲學習，市內市外的重要工塲，照一君沒有一家不會到過。遇事不草率的愼軍性格，着手一件工作，若不等自己完全懂得，斷不中止的執拗熱誠，這完全以「爲國」的精神作基礎，不久，他的才能漸漸地出人頭地，而受知於上司。</p>
<p>當發明八八式小彈底價管蓋螺而獲賞的時候，氏僅三十八歲。他旣不是少年發明家，亦非天才發明家，直至三十八歲的中年，始製成了一件發明品。</p>
<p>營營半生，氏日與機械作伴，而造成了他今日的地位。對付機械不能妥的，機械不能有未成熟的存在，一件發明品的完成，並不是因其奇特而博得人們的稱讚或驚異，完全爲了其實際的效用。一件發明品的，可完成爲第二件繼續完成的津梁。</p>
<p>瞬發信管擊針罩，裝藥室底報壓榨，各種信管的安全栓，自動刻螺機，用機械代替手動式製造各種信管的自動機等數種，賴氏的努力，得以决第完成。開始大量生產，奠定了耐受近代長期消耗戰爭的基礎。信管因其機能而可分爲定時信管與即發信管：又因其裝配的位置而分爲彈頭信管與彈底信管。定時信管者，在發射的瞬間，在砲身中感到所受的衝動而開始動作，從此時起，經過幾秒　後，其彈丸始行炸裂。即發信管者，彈丸興目標衝碰時因震動而發生炸裂。再細分起來，有瞬發，短延期，曳光，及中種信管。</p>
<p>瞬發信管者，彈丸在到達地面而尙未沒入地中的一瞬間發生炸裂：短延期信管者，彈丸在敵人頭上五。六米或十米的距離巳經炸裂，當發射時，其彈丸的加速度，相當於地球引力的幾百倍，其回轉速度每分鐘達二萬轉以上。又普通於彈頭裝置信管的是海軍砲，對付戰車及堡壘陣地陸軍砲的徹甲彈，其信管則裝置於彈底。在諾蒙亨事件中盲進的敵軍大隊戰車，及其堡壘陣地，都是被這彈底信管摧毀的。</p>
<p>照一氏除榮授十三次有功章外，並獲得精勤賞十五次。四十年來，除出差及休假日外，未一日離開職守。其第二子照正上等兵，於昭和十四年五月大別山的激鬥中殉國。（翔：譯自四月十九日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電據華盛　來電：美煤礦礦工公會會長路易斯，已於二日指令該公會所屬五十萬礦工自四日晨起復業。傳美政府與該公會政電委員會間預定於本月十五日前協議新契約及工資問題。</p>
<p>里斯木三日中央社電</p>
<p>據華盛頓消息，美　工聯合會長路易斯昨晚宣布，美國鑛工展期罷工，謂渠巳與華盛頓政府商妥，罷工將農緩兩星期負行。按礦業總罷工之期，本定爲今日，因有五十萬名以上之礦工已於上週末停止工作。路氏宜佈展期罷工消息，適在羅斯福總統向礦工呼籲之前二十分鐘，據路氏宜稱，渠巳通令所屬礦工於明日復工，俾免全國陷於混亂，並鄭重聲言，此乃目前時局之結果。路氏又謂罷工展期，係山礦工聯合會「政策委員會」一致決定。路氏向礦工宣言時，勸令彼等母忘美政　爲彼等唯一雇主，並深冀政府與全美民族深切瞭解礦工所提要求之意義。按羅總統並未正式獲知關於路易斯與美政府會議之任何消息，該會議係於礦工聯合會會長作此宣佈之前舉行，故展期罷工一節，雖於難氏呼籲前公布，羅氏於其廣播演詞初未提及此點。路氏應政府之請求，昨先曾與燃科部長伊克斯商討二小時，衆信罷工之展期殆因礦主已應允礦工增加工資之要求。</p>
<h3 id="c25">羅斯福　呼籲礦工復工 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>里斯本日中央社電華盛頓消息：羅斯福總統因白宮限令所有罷工礦工均須於星期六晨十時前復工之通令，遭礦工聯合會長路易斯之反抗，乃於今晚再向東部　行罷工之五十萬礦工，作措辭迫切之呼籲，痛斥彼等以美國兵士之生命與人人民之安全，作孤注一擲，並表示罷工者如不遵令復工，即將採取嚴峻行動，目下戰事已達新的危機階段，另一怠工之礦工皆足以影響戰爭努力之進展云。羅總統又喚起罷工者之愛國心理，繼稱，「美國之國民乎，余今晚係向美國人民發言，而尤其對吾國公民之爲煤礦工人者，本國現正應付一嚴軍之危險，吾人現時所參加之戰爭，其勝利之結果，國家前途實利賴之」。羅期福總統又稱，渠最近以兩週之光陰巡視二十餘州，曾目擊數萬製造飛機大砲及彈藥之工人，均以長時間從事於艱難工作，而生　狀况　甚困苦，吾人目下之集團努力，對於現時戰事並不爲過。吾人將需要自巳及同盟各國所有之一切，吾人尙未獲勝戰爭，唯有加緊生產，並總力動昌戰爭努力，始能制勝之。國內煤產之停頓，即極短時期亦不啻以海陸戰士之生命與國民未來之安全，作孤注一擲，且此賭博毫無保障，並無必要，允極危險，故渠今特向全體礦工用及國內外之美國人民宣言，煤之生產決不容停頓。羅總統。指出渠之演說，係喚起各礦工之愛國心理，並追溯自珍珠港被襲事件發生以後，美國三大勞工組織—美國勞工聯合會·工業組織大會·與鐵道聯誼會—均宜誓在戰爭時期不舉行罷工，路易斯亦爲參加此項保證之一份子。羅氏又指出在目前之煤業工潮中，調停企圖均吿失敗，乃將此事提交戰時勞働局，但礦工聯合會竟藉口該局持有成見，拒絕參加，是以此次工潮之責任，顯然在礦工聯合會而不在美政府。此種專斷行動之後　，使吾人皆受其威脅。渠深知　活稈度之高漲，使鑛工家屬及數百萬共他工人之生活受其困擾，政府巳決定不容生活稈度上漲，如上次大戰中之情形，並決定維持工資與物價之平衡，吾人迄今尙未抑低若干物品之價格，不獨產煤各區如此，即多數其他城市亦然，有違反物價限制者，皆將予以嚴格之對付。目前戰事正在進行，各礦工應不顧個人之意見，而仍從事於本位工作，因吾人必須軍火接濟海外之軍隊也。倘使任何愛國礦工恢復工作，有保護之必要，則將予以充分妥善之保障，如其需要軍隊管理各礦，並保護復工礦工與其家屬，則爲國家而尤其爲海陸空軍戰士之需要計，自將照辦。羅斯福總統最後作　　有希望結論謂，渠信各礦工將不繼續罷工，但同時又發警吿云，「余作此語之意義，並非忽視余所負美國總統及海陸軍總司令之義務？余所擬進行之第一事，即使煤礦復工是也」。</p>
<p>礦工聯會之門爭</p>
<p>東京三日中央社電據華　頓電：美國礦工公會所屬工人四十五萬人，業於三十日午夜奉該會會長路易斯之命全體罷工，聲勢極爲浩大，羅斯福總統爲之震驚不知所措。按路易斯所主持之礦工公會，具有美國營働史上罕見之健全組織，當一九四一年秋季鋼鐵公司所屬煤礦發生工潮時，該會會堅持其主張，毫不讓步，致匹茲堡地方有一部製鐵製鋼工廠，遂因煤斤之不足被迫停工，迨羅斯福總統請工人以國家前涂爲重，始行復工，至此次工潮乃因路易斯曾於三月十日以美國通貨膨脹後物價高漲，工人所得不敷所出，故要求物價調整局提高全國礦工工資，俾工人得安心工作。無知美國北部無烟煤礦礦主聯合會對此堅不接受，遂致釀成此次工潮。路易斯於今春再當選爲礦工公會會長，渠在產業復興時代，會與羅斯福過從甚密，路易斯自一九三六年脫離勞働聯合會另組工團會議以來，因羅斯福採取保護勞働政策，其勢力乃日益擴大，故渠爲酬答起見，乃於一九三六年總統競選之際，極力　羅斯福搖旗吶喊。自是以後，國際風雲日趨緊急，而路易期之孤立色彩因此更爲濃厚。同時羅斯福所採取之勞働政策亦有所轉換，致彼兩人之感情日疏而漸趨對立。當一九四〇年總統競選時，路易新　聲明支持威爾基，當時美國全國曾爲之衝動。威爾基競選失敗後，渠即辭去工團會議主席之職，與其女卡塞麗主持礦工公會。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電　海通社軍事評述員本日稱，反軸心軍冀圖將軸心軍逐出突尼西亞而作之猛烈攻擊，現已完全停頓，北非局勢在過去數日間，並無變動。英軍於星期四晚及星期五晨，以大砲向恩斐達維爾西北之軸心陣地猛轟後，復於星期五下午，以步兵攻擊，但此項攻擊，僅係局部性質之小規模戰鬥，其目的顯係冀圖改簪陣地，或則冀圖牽掣軸心軍於該處地區。其後英軍步兵被驅回至其原來陣地，英大砲之轟擊亦即大减。星期六南部僅有少數斥堠隊之衝突，彭杜法斯戰况沈寂，梅傑斯埃爾巴勃方面較爲活動，德軍在埃爾柯齊亞鹽湖之西北，作局都攻擊略有進展，敵軍向梅傑斯埃爾巴勃至台波巴之公路，增加壓力，但無顯著進展，在梅傑達海與地中海岸間之山區，美軍與法軍協力作戰，僅有小接觸。</p>

<p>里斯本三日中央社電　聯合社訊，據可靠方面今日然稱，美京外交人士現正紛紛討論美國武力干涉法屬瑪丁尼克之可能性，目下對此步驟雖尙無正式行動，惟美京有勢力份子已對此作非正式試探。</p>
<p>里斯本三日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，美政府因法屬瑪丁尼克島高等事務官勞貝特提督依然忠於法政府，乃於二十六日與該島絕交。美海長諾克斯三十日會見記者發衣談話稱，美政府於絕交後，將對瑪丁尼克島及該島水域停泊中之法艦船採取何等措置，現尙不能表明，美海軍目下正於該島附近哨戒中。又駐該島之監視者將隨時對余報吿該島情勢，現於該島停泊之船舶，除油糟船六艘·商船二艘外，尙有航空母艦「貝阿安」號（二萬五千噸）巡洋艦「達爾克」號（六四九六噸）及「貝爾丹」號（五八八六噸）。法艦隊巳有一部開往卡港。於美軍指揮下從事活動。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城三日中央社電　華盛頓法叛逆份子方面相信，如瑪丁尼克之法國專員勞貝特不接納美國要求，則美軍或將佔領瑪丁尼克。華盛頓消息引該方面之言，謂美國將依據哈瓦那條約之規定，實施軍事佔領，並將承認在該島上成立季勞特戈爾聯合政權，以驅除勞貝特專員。同時該方面並指出美方之取消其與勞貝特專員所訂之協定，僅係其對瑪丁尼克施用壓力，以使該島參加反軸心陣綫之一貫政策之一個步驟而已。美國於去年秋季停運送糧食至瑪丁尼克，至四十五日美國務副卿威爾斯昭吿世界，謂如果需要，美國準備採取軍事行動，但據信勞貝特專員對於仟何登陸之冀圖，必將極力抵抗。此間接獲之消息透露，勞貝特除在復員之法艦隊上擁有一部份水兵外，並有陸軍三千人。瑪丁尼克之防禦設備，除法艦上之大砲外，並有航空母艦自思號上一百零五架飛機之機關槍。</p>

<h3 id="c38">英美通貨問題論爭　英美在戰後通貨上的對立 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>四月五日，美國財政部長摩根索正式發表了戰後通貨案，接着在七日英國經濟學者凱恩斯氏也發表了同樣性質的提案，而英美間關於此問題意見對立的深刻，於此暴露無遺。兩案的詳細內容，尙不明瞭，唯綜合各方面片斷的報道，其對立之點，要以下列三點爲主：</p>
<p>（一）對黃金的見解的不同—摩案延長匯兌平衡資金的概念，用五億「允尼太司」（新設的國際貨幣單位，一「允尼太司」相當於十美元，可與黃金自由由兌換。）來設置國際的滙兌平衡機關，各國通貨經「允尼太司」而與黃金保持一定的交換比率。用這平衡資金以防止國際匯兌市塲的激變，而　兌賣買的差額用現金來結算。至淸算協定則非經特別許可，不予承認。凱案則用票據交換所的形式延長淸算協定的概念，設國際金融中樞機關，國際間的決算祇要在道中樞機關的帳簿上轉一筆賬。這是通貨管理之理論上的根據。至於黃金的任務，則是用作最後的決算手段。以「班科爾」作國際貨幣單位的價値基準。</p>
<p>（二）國際金融中樞機關上的發言權問題—摩案以黃金，外國匯兌保有額及國民所得爲基準、決定其所應投於中樞機關的資金。凱案則以開戰前三年間的貿易額爲基準，顯然前者有利於　，而後者有利於英。</p>
<p>（三）對戰後貿易計劃的不同—據摩案，各國的匯兌，非經中樞機關的許可，不能抑低，假使維持平價面有困難，則貨以黃金。據凱案，一國的透借額，如其一定期間而超過一定限度的塲合，准其自動的抑低，因爲抑低幣値可以促進輸出，換句話說，以商品輸出作國際決算的最後手段。</p>
<p>屈服於政治的理論</p>
<p>如上所述問題的眞相，表示出並不在於經濟而在於政治方面。如依凱恩斯氏票據交換所的說法，決算差額的負方，用商品輸出來作爲最後的處理手段，所以他所假定的「班科爾」單位，不一定要與黃金發生聯繫。這是爲了防止產金地南菲聯邦的傾向美國。照凱氏以前的理論看來，是一種墮落，是向政治的屈服。</p>
<p>但凱案亦有其限度。蓋如其恢復金本位，則英帝國在美國的黃金覇權下，將無置喙的餘地，於是想出了一種妥協約折衷案，這案旣不是完全的管理通貨，也不是完全以黃金爲基礎。</p>
<p>唯利是圖的摩案</p>
<p>現在世界黃金的分佈，完全偏在於美國，如其不重新分配，則以黃金作基礎的各國通貨，殊難望其安定。摩案的難題就在於此。美國認爲黃金將不再分配於世界各國，推開天窗說亮話，美國希望各國把軍事根據地，或政治的經濟的利權來掉換黃金。</p>
<p>實在說來，凱案所暗示者，使美國成爲一個輸入國，各國輸出商品至美國，而美國則放出黃金。這確是眞正的平衡。然而美國在戰後自身將發生生產過剩的現象，那裏再容得下各國的商品來美傾銷。於此，在直接通貨問題之後，黃金問題緊跟着上來了。</p>
<p>美國在戰前股置了世界最高的關稅壁壘，其內部有九百萬平方公里，一億三千萬人口的自由市塲，一切均咄嗟立辦。這與歐洲完全不同，在歐洲，乘一天火車，要經過數個政治的，經濟的，文化的國境綫。在美國地方。無論到那裏，霄語，風俗，習慣，思想，一切都相同的，而美國經濟的基本特徵，是規格統一，產業合理化，與大量生產。僅有英帝國集團要想與之對抗，相差甚遠。根本的理由因爲散佈於世界各地的集團份子，不能在軍事上守住的緣故。所以歐洲廣域圈—英國要想在政治上，經濟上，軍事上支配的—無論如何是必要的。</p>
<p>英國的這種經濟動向，在三月二十一日邱吉爾演說中，變爲「歐洲家族」這名詞的政治的表現。「歐洲家族」的意義，主張像以前那樣小國的主權不能再存在了。</p>
<p>歐洲廣域圈論</p>
<p>美國以前對國際聯盟及汎歐運動素抱猜疑與不安之念，今亦已同樣的眼光來窺伺英國的動向。美國的軍需品貸與計劃，——成爲民主國家的兵工廠，穀倉的眞正意義，乃是想在戰後世界可保持絕對優勢的武力，生產力，美國的計劃，仍堅持門羅主義，並以此爲核心，而向世界市塲，世界經濟發展。</p>
<p>這計劃表現在政治上就是大西洋憲章中的自由通商主義，民族自決主義。更深入考察起來，這是美國資本，美國商品的自由移動，乃是反對歐洲廣域論的張本。</p>
<p>英美的焦燥</p>
<p>英美對戰後世界的野心，經通貨論爭而暴露出來了。這是今日決戰階段上戰力增强問顆的焦燥之表現。</p>
<p>（一）想到戰後生產過剩問題重大，英美—尤其是美國，想阻止增强生產。可是目前這過慮是不能不加以排斥的。傳說中的反軸心農業會議上，即是這種努力的表現之一。</p>
<p>（二）美國的政治家資本家若沒有掃除他們所掛慮的肯泰基山中所秘藏的黃金，一旦變成無價値的東西，則他們將不能安心工作。</p>
<p>（三）若提起戰後問題，則不能不涉及通貨問題，而美國則又不能不主張金本位。美國也曾知道凱恩斯氏在草擬通貨案，所以先行發動，供國民獲得美國在國際經濟上有指導性的印像，而提高其信任政府的民氣。金本位主張的先行發動，正是英美，尤其是美國的焦燥之表現。（翔：譯自四月二十日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c39">英美的國際貨幣論爭 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>反軸心方面關於戰後經營的構想，常把戰敗的事實支吾蒙蔽過去。他們的這種搗鬼，原是一種宣傳謀略，即冀　把那以爲穩可獲得這回大戰的最後勝利之錯覺，散布於全世界；可是其結果，却反而引起英美兩國以此爲中心之政治的經濟的對立，把自己陣營裏的矛盾和分裂暴露出來：這實在是一件很可痛快的事情。</p>
<p>現在日舉出一個在最近發生的顯著的事例—即關於戰後國際貨幣安全案的英美的醜爭。這個問題，爲凱恩斯的提議國際貨幣改革案所肇端。凱恩斯爲世界有數的經濟學家，現任央格蘭銀行理事。英國把這個提議提交前决在倫教舉行的反軸心金融會議中後，於本月七日，復由財政部長伍德，用白皮書的形式，把它公表。對之，美國方面，果然悻悻見於辭色，施以駁論。那就是財務長官摩根索，想要把他的助理者哈利。霍弗伊特所草成之「對於協約同盟諸國家的安定基礎的提案，」以代巷凱恩斯的提案；本月五日，摩根索在上院外交委員會，銀行貨幣委員會，戰後經濟政策計劃委員會等的聯合秘密會議席上加以發表。</p>
<p>凱恩斯捉案的內容，以下述五大項目爲骨幹，即（一）設置國際清算銀行而設其樞紐於倫敦·紐約·（二）設定以稱爲「班科爾一的金爲基礎之國際會計單位，（三）創設國際的商品同業聯盟機構，（四）設置國際投資機構，（五）草擬國際經濟計劃。換句話說，就是設定淸算國際貿易所用以金爲基準的國際貨幣制度，而以「班科爾」爲其貨幣單位，依着金價統制的維持或變更之新貨幣政策，由英美當其操作之任，由此以設定國際商品價格。於是各國得以班科爾爲基礎，決定其本國貨幣的對外價値；而加盟國對於國際淸算銀行的出資，則換算爲班科爾，作爲存款，記入賬簿，以爲各國間滙兌淸算的儲備。更爲維持班科，商品，和金三者間安定的關係起見，設立國際商品的調節機關，從事過剩物資的收買，現有貨品的放出。並謀經濟落後國的開發和工業化，及謀充實金融資金短缺諸國的資本需要起見，對於上述以班科爲多角的滙兌清算時之入超國家，由國際投資機關與以國際借款的金融援助，以裨助戰後的經濟復興。並且爲使國際淸算得以恒久維持其圓滑的運營起見，草擬國際規模的經濟計畫，以確保國際經濟的均衡。</p>
<p>對之，霍弗伊特的提案，則注重國際金本位制的復活，澈頭澈尾由　金以統制世界各國的貨幣，藉各國醵金以設定世界貨幣平衡資金，同時創設國際貨幣統制局，由國際監督委員會當管理之任，以禁止加盟國的貨幣自由减價爲條件，提倡新國際貨幣單位「允尼太司」（規定以美金十圓爲等價可和黃金自由兌換）。又聲明美國爲使各國相互間的貿易交易圓滑遂行起見，支出匯兌平衡資金的半額五十萬萬美圓。美國的眞意不消說，是爲着要救濟現在死藏於止塔基州的福托諾克斯山中從全世界搜刮得來的價値二百數十寓萬美圓之金，和大戰同時封閉了的美國金鑛業，才有着這種計畫的。</p>
<p>如本報（讀賣報知自稱）十七日夕刋所載特電的指摘，凱恩斯提案是要把決算貨幣單位班科爾和金相連繫，而否定恢復嚴密意味上之金本位制，主張由休用多角滙兌淸算制度而把世界經濟加以再組織。這是和軸心國的藉用非金貨幣以建立世界經濟的構想，完全接近的，在國際經濟之基本的理念上，可說是模擬軸心國的。然而巳從世界經濟的王座跌落下來了的英國，爲要對美國呈其媚態起見，乃想把國際貨幣的基礎澈底放在金本位制，現在更表示着對於金本位制的　戀不捨之念，故其多角的滙兌淸算制的機能，到底不能發揚。換言之，由於金的束縛，大多數的國家，依然不得不處於英美的國際經濟稱覇獨佔之下。是故凱恩勘如共眞的以世界經濟的再建爲念，當然不得不與軸心國的世界新秩序之方向相一致。又藉口於世界貨幣的再建，以圖解決本國的存金問題，完全恢復「允尼太司」的國際金本位制，以滙兌限制的卽時撤廢，不健全的資本流動的制限，淸算協定的禁止等爲其前提條件，而要求自由貿易的再開，由此以圖恢復戰前的國際經濟秩序，和再建自己的繁榮，美帝國主義的這種野心和其獨善自處的態度，我們實不勝痛憤。</p>
<p>今日的世界經濟正由金本位經濟逐漸移行於物本位經濟，金本位制旣巳爲歷史所否定了。當此大戰方酣之際，東亞與歐洲，正由其以中樞國爲中心的滙兌淸算制度的締結，施行着廣域金融圈之雄偉的建設。而且成立於新圈內諸國間的價値比率，是完全不藉金而於圈內物資之圓滑的交流上最爲合宜的貨幣價値，故得以成立共存共榮的自給自足的關係，由着指導國之有計劃的決算手段的調整，逐漸導向運命與一體的經濟構成。不但如此，即在友好的圈和圈之間的貿易，也像日德支付協定，巳把金排除掉了。在今日的經濟史的階段，可說甚至連作爲金的圈間支付手段的最後牙城，無論質的或量的，均巳受到極度的限制。軸心國所主張的由廣域經濟以重建世界經濟，在各圈指導國間，如果成立信賴，相互講求山締結支付協定的物資之調整，對於不得已的支付差額，容許一定的信用借款，則把金由這種圈間支付中排除，是可能做到的事，吾人相信這是歷史的必然結果。（丁：譯自四月二十一日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>該組合鑒於捲烟求過於供，所以四期派貨數額酌予增多，分甲乙丙丁四級制配給。所配之貨，包括　中烟公司·中華烟公司·及華商大東·福新·南洋·華成等廠出品。只限各經銷行號門售，絕對不准轉販等不法行爲。各督察員之抽查甚爲認眞，並備各行號經售報吿冊，以資稽核。關於上海近郊派貨事宜，將於本旬內實行，一切批發商登記事宜巳辦竣。至華中其他地派貨，由各地該組合分會辦理之。一切　烟售價，各地完全一律，故該組合機構健全之後，掙烟黑市勢必無形消滅，轉販者將無利可圖。</p>
<p>負責人談捲煙限價</p>
<p>據烟草組合負責人談：本組合目奉令辦理烟捲配給，爲時雖暫，然努力進行，不敢有私，乃苦於登記商號，拒遵限價發售烟捲，並詭言烟捲限價，尙未公布，此言實似是而非。綠本組合對捲烟價格，早經公布。對若干尙未公布之捲烟價格，決於最短期內，予以公布。是後如再有卸賣商或小賣商不照公定價格售烟，則本組合職責所在，決予嚴懲，並盼各警務當局，及各界人士予以協助。</p>
<p>操縱軋買亟應消除</p>
<p>捲烟配給，旣巳實施，惟一般吸姻者，尙未獲得配給平價捲烟之利益。蓋平價捲烟之發售，不爲零售店所操縱，卽爲一般恃强「軋買」者所搶購。茲配給當局除力求公允配給外，將對此項現象，而以消除。</p>

<h3 id="c48">國民論壇　禁絕南市財塲 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 吳承康</p>
<p>在輿論一致要求取絲投囤禁絕烟賭之際，政府當局已經俯順與情，對滬市投機派昌澈查了，雖然還需要再接再厲去繼續努力，以期達到預期的成效，但這一來足以使奸商們心寒胆慄，稍歛猖獗凶燄，得毌使我們謳歌不置！</p>
<p>投機囤積有同樣害處的南市賭塲，至今還不聞當局有什麽動靜，依舊任其逍遙地存在着，據統計由此傾家蕩產淪爲乞丐的平均每日有六十人之多，本巿犯罪案件的日見增多，大都與賭博有關，我們對此，眞大表遺憾。</p>
<p>最使人驚異的是特地爲管理各賭窟而設立的「特種俱樂部管理處」，各賭塲入口處張貼着皇皇吿示：說什麼「沒有身份証者不准入內」啦，「形跡不檢的嚴禁進塲」啦，門口站着武裝者保護賭塲的安全眞使人百思而莫解。</p>
<p>我們要求當局再三想一想：以鉅萬經費去維持地方治安，而同時去保護這些「罪惡淵藪」的存在，實際上犯了陷民於罪的嫌疑，是否爲聰明的舉動？在號稱我國第一大都市國際觀瞻所繫的上海，又正當各國交還租界放棄治外法權的當兒，看了這樣矛盾現象，無論如何是件說不過去的事。一</p>
<p>不容諱言亦不能諱言，南市賭塲的存在有其由來巳漸的複雜原因，其中最大的當然是經濟原因；但是我們不相信賭捐收入會列入地方預算之一，更不致會列入中央預算之一，那末所謂經濟的原因還不是一件不可吿人的事情嗎！</p>
<p>所以，不談刷新政治則巳，不求爭取民心亦巳，否則在取締滬市投機之後，緊接的該是禁絕南市賭塲，「一路哭，不如一家哭。」我們馨香祈禱我—當局體會斯旨，迅施這萬民全望的德政！</p>

<p>日本在大東亞戰爭中，陸海軍所以取得大戰果的原因，不僅是將士英勇盡忠報國所致，且也不能不歸功於供給戰塲的飛機，坦克車，槍砲，各種優秀科學兵器，以及糧秣，藥品，建設器材等等。陸軍方面，對於這類勝利兵器的發明家曾頒發過第二次陸軍技術有功獎章，茲把到得獎章者，以及主要發明家介紹於次：（　：譯自四月十七日東京每日新聞）</p>
<p>新型驅蚊香的發明</p>
<p>…陸軍上尉田村　…</p>
<p>陸軍軍需品廠大阪分廠調達科長田村享上尉，是盡人皆知的航海權威家。該上尉是神戶貿易商田村商會的主人，也是日本精米製粉會社的社長，兼兵庫縣靑少年團副團長的官職，這對於現役軍人是有些奇怪的。應召釗大阪軍需品分廠去服務的該氏，仟務就是改良除虫菊製品以及調查其價格。</p>
<p>該氏在和歌山巿箕島町資生堂化學工業，帝國除虫菊會社等處，開始硏究製品。他對於過去的渦卷式驅蚊香，看到爲了製作成圈型必須用手一根一根地灣曲過來，有些麻煩，所以他就想怎樣可以用機器生產。於是爲了完成自己所想到的任務，便開始同員工備嘗辛苦共同　硏這一新的工作。後來發見蚊香　狀不如方型燃燒面積寬大，且對壓出式機器生產更爲方便。此外，蚊香點着時，芷是蚊子多的時候，所以起初要叫蚊香多出烟，最後只要叫蚊虫不前來釘咬就够了。這是他自己的經騐，所以他就把蚊香的前端作的粗大些，末尾則細小些，於是還可以收到節的的效果。同時他把蚊香作成兩頭蛇一樣，前端分成兩個頭，這是希望最初能收到出烟的效果。</p>
<p>此外，蚊香的形式像過去那樣挾並式，在中途常常熄滅，所以把蚊香的末尾弄上一個小洞，放入一片薄薄的洋　片，這樣就會好好的燃燒，同時根據自己的經騐與注意機械化關係，竟又發明了蚊香大量生產的機器。由於這種生產關係，勞力可以减省二成五，容積也减少二成五，且把蚊香的圓型改爲長方型，而其輪送力也增加了二成多。在被蚊子羣所善　的南力軍隊，非常歡迎田村上尉所發明的新型　蚊香。</p>
<p>研究前進作業方式的飛機生產</p>
<p>…三菱　工業名古屋航空　製作所技師佐佐木涉（三十七歲）外加協力者…</p>
<p>榮獲冠軍的佐佐木氏，是從過去日本技術家的典型隊伍中選拔出來的，這就是說他並非單單是技術養成者，而他是愛好技術，且以技術爲第二生命的一個人。擔負這種硏究，以致發奮忘食，同部下共黨難苦，拚命研究，於是去夏終於病倒，現在住院療養着，但他很頑强地對同事說「這樣的病就不能作事，眞豈有此理」，所以他在病床上仍然繼續不斷地埋頭硏究。一向日本的生產技術都是由工頭主管，因此每個人的生產率總不能提高，比較德國低弱數倍，道種狀態會繼續　循久。爲了提高每個人的生產率，就必須改進技衛管理與作業管理。爲使實現這一點，官民技術家會耗費過最大的心血。特別在飛機生產方面，建造機體作業佔着重嬰的因素，所以改善其作業管理後，而竟收到擴大生產的效果。</p>
<p>佐佐木氏自從民國二十一年來從事這種研究，首先使員工理解眞正的技術，養成爲皇國服務的幹部員工，後又繼續了一年爲研究而作的基本考查，終於民國三十年九月完成了「前進作業方式的飛機生產」。根據這種生產方法，比巳往的生產率增加了〇成，眞替日本陸軍機生產方面增光不少。這種研究還期待於一切生產範圍內都加以妥當地採用。由於採用該方法，全國飛機工塲都在突飛猛進地發展着，這實在對於擴大生產擊潰盎格魯薩克遜民族的陸軍機上有莫大的供獻。當局更進一步按照道種研究改善發動機和其他部門內的技術管理，以求加强生產。</p>
<h3 id="c58">經濟界　評言　消費者的自衛 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>在目前物價高漲生活費昂騰的重壓下，一般消費者，除呼籲政府干涉，藉以壓低物價，减輕生活費而外，惟有自己痛下決心，團結起來，一致向囤積居奇者施行抵抗。</p>
<p>晚近東西各國，有所謂消費者同盟，即所以抵抗生產者之剝削暴利，如一八三九年起之英國反穀物保護關稅同盟，第一次默戰前之美國反肉類托辣斯同盟，德國反啤酒托辣斯同盟，以及法國反瓦斯托辣斯同盟等是。此外世界上一般熱心改良社會人士之設立禁酒會，禁烟會，節制會，素食會，布衣會，戒殺會，以及購買者社會同盟等，其志趣固不僅在於擁護消費者的自身利益，枊且在於維持世道人心。</p>
<p>最近滬上消費合作社運動之興起，大有風起雲湧之勢，此外是消費者起而日術以抵制囤虎之一種自動行爲，吾人深切與以同情。</p>
<p>不過，吾人覺得處此亂世，大小囤虎多如過江之鯽，我們一般消費者對付他們的最好方法，恐怕還是節的消費。不管囤貨標價如何刺激人心地天天抬高，我們萬不要因此起了恐慌，爭先恐後的去購買。上等皮鞋聽牠漲到一千幾百元一雙，上等脚踏車，八千元一輛，上等地毯，一萬二千元一條；讓牠們熱昏地去漲吧！讓一般囤虎們發一筆空紙上的國難財吧！到了不久的將來，和平光臨，物價瀉落，目看現在自以爲不可一世的囤虎，其結果是怎麼樣？</p>

<p>財政部當局爲謀復興農村增强生產起見，責任交通銀行辦理之復興農村放款事宜，經該行派員分赴江蘇之南京·鎮江·無錫·常州·蘇州·崑山·浙江之杭州·嘉興·硤石等兩鐵路沿綫，暨安徽之蕪湖·蚌埠等處鄉鎭調查農村狀况及耕植情形，以爲農村一放款之準繩，現調查工作已吿完成，刻正擬具農村放款整個計劃，卽將呈部核示後逐步實行。</p>
<p>貸付款項四規則</p>
<p>該組織並將遣派調查員？出發（蘇·浙·皖·）調查農村經濟狀况，再由各行莊認定貸付款項，其辦法規定如下，（一）農村抵押貸付之對象爲農村抵押、（二）農倉抵押貸付對象爲農業各倉庫。（三）耕牛·農具貸付對象，限定於加入農村合作社之農民。（四）靑苗貸付對象，限定於農業合作社之農民。</p>
<p>抑低農村貸款利率</p>
<p>各銀行並將擬照當局法令，以全體存款五分之一作爲農業貸付資金，當局爲協助此項事業起見，對於農村貸付資金之利率，將竭力予以抑低，以助農村生產事業復興。</p>
<p>貸付額達數萬萬元</p>
<p>又悉本市銀行業之會員銀口存款總額爲十九萬萬元，加人錢兌業公會之會員錢莊之存款總額爲六萬萬元至六萬五千萬元，若以銀　業十丸萬萬元存款之五分之一計算，則貸付資金總數可達數寓萬元。是以最近各銀行與中國絲業股份有限公司成立五十萬元之借款，完全爲扶助該公司收買春繭發展蠶絲事業之用云。</p>

<h3 id="c70">譯論　對農村金融的期待 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>關於增加戰時農業生產的議論，幾决提及，但有多種問題，尙在調查硏究的階段，未能成爲具體的對策而實現。不過，僅在金融方面有了農村金融團的組織，中儲銀行的農業透支等，這些都是增强農產的施策，値得重視的。</p>
<p>觀之現在農村的金融狀態，祇有靠典當，合會來調度一點資金，同時還有若干業主個人的放款，商人的現物貸款等，不過數目　微，而且利息太高所以這種貸放，並無增强生產的資金性格，僅不過農民渡一時難關的借款。現在中國農業的最大課題，就是如何使增强生產資金述通至農村，如何充實灌溉設備與耕牛等類，如何去購進肥料。但是尙幸財政部當局的臂助，巳接近解決的方向，這是堪喜的一件事。</p>
<p>現在農村金融團用何種形式放款雖不明瞭，總之是跟着這幾個現實去做：第一，用極低利息，第二，敖長借期，第三，貸款對象並非農村常豪，都是庶民階級。過去中儲銀行及其他銀行的地方放款，利息似乎取之太高，所以，能够利用其貸款者，並不是農民及眞正的生產者，祇有那些利用此借款　　貸　　重利的商號。農民爲生產、　能使用的資金，利息至多爲周年一分左右。同時，此借款期至少要十年以上，如果是　以　辦灌漑工具或耕牛等類的　金，應該定期三　或五年償還。</p>
<p>我們最最　望於當局者，就是農村放款千定不能養成農村的厚利貸款。假使貸款祇以所謂殷　者爲對象，或則重視押款，那麼資金必然流入富豪手中，結果助長了富豪們借債放債的重利盤剝。對於毫無担保品的貧民去放款，雖然困難，然而並非不可能的事。應該想法利用合作社乃至耕牛等類現物貸款來扶助農村。</p>
<p>無論如何，金融界能夠注軍到農村放款，總是可喜的現象。國府當局更應助長此項趣勢，同時强制各銀行，規定在其貸款總額中劃出百分之幾爲農村放款，這未始不是一個好辦法。亟盼積極努力注重農村金融才好。（雲鵬：譯自五月三日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c71">假冒 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 周驌</p>
<p>聽說『×花脾』的化妝品有偽造的。偽造的怎會有人要買呢？然而，有人要買，銷路還不壞呢！因爲：偽造得『幾可亂眞』，和眞的簡直不能分辨出來。——這確令孤陋寡聞的區區驚奇了。</p>
<p>不過，無論如何，於此亦可見國人模倣力之『偉大』了。就可惜這『偉大』的模倣力不用在其他有用的事業上，而單是往道些不關緊要的牛角尖裏鑽，這不但是不能令人敬服，而且還覺得頗爲可悲和可恥。</p>
<p>但是，這罪過却不能全歸諸於偽造化妝品的廠商們：倘使這般『愛修飾者』不醉心於舶來品，倘使他們和她們有愛用國貨的心理和行動，偽造的猖獗一定不至於此。</p>
<p>儘是模倣人家，跟在人家的屁股後面走，永遠就祇能『屈　人下』，沒有和人家『並駕齊驅』的日子，更不用想跑在人家的前面，去做人家的領導者。</p>
<p>不獨模倣化妝品是如此，無論在藝術上，科學上，工業上，商業上，若祗是模倣，祇是『冒牌』，祇是拾人牙慧，一點不想創造，絲毫沒有獨立精神的話，就祗好永遠跟在人家的屁股後面，做一個落伍者而已。</p>
<h3 id="c72">漫談自殺 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 枕琱戈</p>
<p>假使你聽到一件不明眞相的自殺案，你一定會猜測自殺者所以自殺的原因了：假使他是大商人，你一定會猜他投機失敗；假使他是一個靑年，你一定以爲他是情塲失意，假使她是一個十九世紀的婦女，你一定以爲她是受不了公婆的虐待；但是，這些不過是我們一般人所知道的一般浮面的原因罷了。</p>
<p>自殺在現在的世界上，已是很普通的了。在美國平均每半小時即有一個人自殺，即使在我們的上海，依照報章的統計，也很普遍。</p>
<p>在歐美各國的統計中，確是非常有趣的：自殺者，大牛是無業的，受過相當敎育的，三十九歲左右的壯年人，自殺年齡，低的亦祇有十四五歲，高的有至七十歲　關於自殺者的性別，男子是要比女人多三倍以上的，他的自殺時季，大概以夏季爲最多，冬季爲少。</p>
<p>關於自殺的工具，大概女子是溫和的男子是痛快的：當然他們亦在進步的。從前的女子，多是懸樑爲最多，現在巳用安眠藥，來沙爾，雅片代替了，甚至最近更用其他化學藥品來自殺，男子的自殺法多半是跳樓，跳海，手槍之類。另外還有一個統計：凡是吃雅片自殺者的棺材重開時，其屍體十之四五是移動過的。</p>
<p>自殺的主要原因，依照心理學的解說，是潛伏在心靈深處的極複雜的下意識在作崇。這種作用的發生，是早在兒童時代就有的：當他要一件東西而沒有得到的時候，他就會產生一種仇恨的心理！如果不休止地遇着，他就會不停地增加，到最後就會有由仇恨而變到仇殺的變態；這種心理潛伏着，如果遇到外界的激動，再加上自己的理智失去制力，就發生殺人的思念，殺人不遂，就自殺了。所以很多的專家曾說過「不存殺人的心念，是不會自殺的。」</p>
<p>防止自殺的方法：那就是在兒童時代，盡可能地消除一切足以引起精神不安的因素，在成人，則有增加修養法和補之以精神安慰法。</p>
<h3 id="c73">「理想」 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 靑君</p>
<p>對理想的看法和見解，似乎各有不同。有人把理想看做不可能實現的一種念頭，像我們常聽到說的一句話：「喂，這事情你太理想了：」包含在這語氣中的，分明有着兩種不同的感情，一種是善意的規勸，一種是惡意的嘲諷：當然，這是需要從講話者的態度和感情上來決定的。</p>
<p>把理想當做「空想」，「幻想」來認識的——它即是把一種高超的，能够付諸實施的進步的思想的價値，不加考慮地一筆勾消，凡抱有這種見解的人，我認爲是一個笨伯才會有的想頭：否則，這個人就是白痴，或是他的頭腦巳經失去了思考的能力。</p>
<p>因此，在正確而合理的解釋理想兩個字的時候，我覺得，理想應該是一種根據現實世界存在着的事物，通過某一個人的思考，溶解在這一人物的生平的　騐的累積中，再經過他的思維組織的審判，而創造出一種理想來。那麽，這釉理想，就是根據現實世界上的一切使人不滿意的事象，或是應該澈底改革的一種設施，而成爲有計劃地創造出來的一部崇高的「計劃書」。</p>
<p>這樣理想不但不是空想，幻想，而是一種有機地推動社會，甚至世界，以及整個人類向前進步的發動機。這樣，要是世界上沒有一個高超的，進步的，對這世界上不滿意的地方加以改善的完滿的理想，那末，這世界就只有一天腐朽一天，終至於走向毀滅的道路上去，而這個世界上的人類就不會有一點生氣。</p>
<p>所以，我們應該歡迎正確　理想存在在每個人的思想體系中間。而造成今天大部份人對世界有一種積極的，步向光明的勇敢精神，這點我們就不能不歸功於理想的偉大了。吾則，世界上厭世的人們，恐怕還會增加上不知多少倍呢？</p>
<p>總之，我們應該有有計劃的理想，栽培這些理想的發展和滋長，這才會有整個世界，整個人類的燦爛的前途。然而理想是原則的東西，最重要的却是一個「做」宇，否則，空洞的理想還是難以見諸實施的。</p>

<p>— 夢牛</p>
<p>不知怎樣我近來是愈來愈憂鬱了！朋友們嘻笑着出去，拉我一定也去，我懇求地：「你們去吧！」</p>
<p>頹唐，自私，冷淡，焦慮，暮氣……啊！這許多怪名詞，從前不過在我耳邊掠過，現在都加到我身上來了。牠們猶如無數的鋼針，根根地向我的心胸飛來，我感得懔慄，不知該如何對付。</p>
<p>每天，每天，我只是對着窗，望着天，看流水似的行雲，翱翔的飛鳥，藍得可怖的高空，遠處瘦弱的樹梢……朋友們說我「變」了，都說我「變」了。「變」，又是一個怪名字。</p>
<p>他們勸我外面去散步，我答應了，跟着他們走去。我低着頭走，數淸每塊石頭，凝視每根草，每粒沙泥，和路上的每顆埃塵。他們似乎談得興高采烈，而且笑着。我抬頭看他們，他們笑得更厲害了，我也似乎笑着，但我不知他們談些什麽。</p>
<p>一個老敎授一天這樣的對我說：「消極是一種靑年病，是埋葬靑年的毒病。你現在正當年靑，最容易受這毒魔的侵襲。你對於現實的不滿，四面環境的對你　罩，你要振翼反抗。但，不幸地，你爲這毒魔克制了。在它的巨掌中，你像一隻鬥敗的雄鷄，蟄伏一隅，無能爲力了。但是，你的心還燃燒着，餘燼尙未熄，將來仍能吐出熊熊的萬丈火燄。所以我希望你努力保護，培養那將息未息的餘燼因爲這是你的無價至寳—同時要提起精神，專心於你的工作，你該向切實一方面幹去，而不可走上幻想的路。記着：『靑年是生命的春天』」。</p>

<p>「刺激」是人生的一服調味品，沒有它，人們將過着庸庸碌碌的一生，刺激越多，則經騐也越廣，所謂「經騐」也就是每决面迎着刺激的積儲。</p>
<p>我們全是反對者的勝利者，當刺激來時，一定要沉着應戰，如果沒有反抗，我們就無從鞏固自己的意志，像一顆大樹，經過千萬决的暴風雨的吹打，非但不會折斷，而且也越見鞏固。</p>

<p>— 邵達</p>
<p>「人爲財死」巳成了一般後人們的格言。其實這僅不過是句似是而非的話罷了，這句話裏所包含的意思太籠統，旣沒有指出何一種人，更沒有說出那一種財，單以「人爲財死」這四個字來包括了天下所有的一切人與財，未免不合。</p>
<p>「人爲財死」，的確有許多人入了牠的牢籠，爲了財，不惜犧牲自己的生命，賣絕同類的情義，爲非作歹，害人害己，不過牠的勢力雖大，可是還不能够包盡天下所有的人，翻開中外古今的歷史來看，許多偉大的英雄志士的死，却都沒有死在這裏面。財固然可以叫人死，可是「信義禮恥道節孝志」又那一個不値得使人視死如歸呢？</p>

<p>亨脫說：「內部有了純潔無瑕的心靈，外表才會發出閃爍的光明。」我們相信，內部的純潔無瑕，是造成外表閃爍光明；但是，一般人是講求外表的，從不注意到內部的。</p>
<p>我們看看今日的社會上，許多的人都在講求外表，而忽略內部的充實。因此，在表面上看來；很像一個人，却不知道是「繡花枕頭與爛稻草」呢！只是觀望外表而已。</p>
<p>所以，眞眞有學識，有才幹的人，他的修養，必定從內部做起的：先講求內部的充實，修養，使內部造成純潔無瑕的心靈，然後外表也自然而然的閃爍光明了。</p>

<h3 id="c79">「哲學」·「人生」 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>要眞切的了解某種事物的價値與意義，不能單靠事實的單調變化和它的外表，而要硏究事實的因果。和它內部蘊藏的眞理，這就是「哲學」所包括的東西。假如人生離了哲學便是無意義的人生，同樣假使哲學離了人生，也是沒有什麽價値可言了。</p>
<p>哲學並不是一種神秘的東西，它只不過是硏究人們日常生活的專門學科。哲學能刻劃出現實生活的正誤，替你找出一條應當如何過生活的路來，才使不讓「人生」虛度。</p>
<p>硏突哲學是要有「打破沙鍋問到底」的精神，有這種精神方能發現「人生」。譬如說捉到一個强盜，普通人就立刻送捕究辦而已，但硏究哲理的人就不同，他要硏究爲什麼他要做强盜？爲什麼社會沒有別的職業給他做？爲什麽他內在的惡德能戰勝他的好德？……這樣問下去他就能進一步懂得人生，懂得社會。而成爲他哲學的心得，所以哲學是一種由小事化大開來，從內在蘊藏的意義。融合現實的根據演化而來，所謂政治哲學，社會哲學，人生哲學……無非是從人生問題中推衍問明而來的。</p>
<p>希臘大哲學家蘇格拉底曾說過「未經考察過的生活是不値得活的。」所以假使要使人生有意義，要過有理性的生活，必須評估自己的生活，硏究社會與吾人的連繫關係，要有一懷疑」的精神，來探討事實的因果，使「人生」走上合理的軌道。</p>
<p>你曾經考察過你的生活嗎？我想每一個「活人」能明瞭自已生活在這世界上的價値與意義是必須的吧！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Regarding the Current Political Situation: What We Hope from the Japanese Government and Public <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>For days, we have been arguing that the National Government must strengthen its political position. Internally, it must achieve complete peace, solidifying the already changing sentiments of the people in the pacified areas, and thereby liberating the majority of compatriots imprisoned under the rule of the Chongqing regime, bringing them to our side to isolate the minority in Chongqing who cling to the Anglo-American-dependent regime, preventing it from continuing the war. Then, we can enhance our cooperation with Japan and jointly advance towards the path of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States, completing the task of victory as soon as possible. Therefore, we propose that "Public Opinion" and "People's Participation in Politics" are the two major forces for promoting enlightened politics and strengthening political status, hoping that the government will sincerely accept and develop them. We are confident that this judgment is not based on temporary emotional impulses or representing a certain position. We base our consistent arguments on the intentions of various sectors of the people, combined with the unique character of the Chinese people and historical lessons, using an objective and rational attitude as a foundation for analysis and understanding.</p>
<p>Because people have different views and different interests, and at the same time, in order to emphasize our arguments, we feel that our words may be straightforward and sincere. We hope that the authorities who value public opinion will take a "superior man rejoices on hearing of his faults" attitude.</p>
<p>Our expectations for the government will naturally be offered at any time. Today, we would like to discuss the issues of recent days and, based on the fundamental perspective of Sino-Japanese cooperation, explain our views to our friendly nation, Japan, and its government and public as follows:</p>
<p>First, what we want to ask is, to date, who are the people cooperating with Japan in China? Or which departments are they? If cooperation is with certain levels of people, to put it bluntly, people in the Chinese bureaucracy, then the results of "cooperation" will absolutely not be as effective as imagined. Even more unfortunately, if "cooperation" is with corrupt officials, bureaucrats, politicians, and local bullies, or institutions and organizations that are all show and no substance, then not only will there be no good effect, but the more closely they "cooperate," the more the Chinese people will suffer. We are not saying that "cooperation" is harmful, but that the choice of "cooperation" target is important. If the "cooperation" target is correct, the closer the "cooperation," the more effective it will be. We believe that the most correct target of cooperation is the vast majority of the Chinese people. Of course, this does not mean that Japan should cooperate with every Chinese person, but rather with those people and departments that can represent the wishes and interests of the majority of the people, including wise officials in the government, fair local gentry, clean political organizations, and legitimate people's groups. We also solemnly tell our friends in the friendly nation that to understand China, you must first understand the people's will; to understand the government, you must first understand the people's will. With this most fundamental understanding and knowledge, you can choose the correct target for cooperation, and you can achieve the expected results of cooperation.</p>
<p>Second, the essence of the change in Japan's policy towards China should lie in helping China move towards independence and autonomy, strengthening the position of the National Government, cooperating in completing the victory in the war against the United Kingdom and the United States, and jointly undertaking the task of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Chinese people will understand the deep expectations and sincere reliance. However, the Chinese people have been hoping for a change in Japan's policy towards China for ten years, and now it has suddenly become a reality, which is the most gratifying thing. However, the general public values reality, especially since the level of education of the Chinese people is shallow and uneven, and they are not easily interested in all the good-sounding terms or grand political ideals. They only ask what is actually different for the people before and after the friendly nation Japan's change of policy towards China? In other words, if Japan's new policy towards China is only of interest to a few people, then the majority of ordinary people will be disappointed. Therefore, we believe that if the change is more completely targeted at what the Chinese people need, it will be able to receive cooperation that is twice as effective as it is now. This reason, we believe that friendly people who are familiar with the situation in China and concerned about Chinese public opinion, already understand very well, and there is no need to reiterate it.</p>
<p>Third, "The Chinese problem must be solved by the majority of the Chinese people themselves." This point is already felt by all friendly people who are familiar with the situation in China. Because any party in China accounts for only a small minority of the people. The current Nanjing National Government is indeed the only government leading the Chinese people in their revival and nation-building. At the same time, it is undeniable that there is also the Chongqing regime entrenched in the southwest and the Communist Party entrenched in the northwest. China has three kinds of people in form, but in essence they are still "Chinese people," who will eventually return to the intention of unification. That is to say, although they are formally divided into three kinds of people, they are only waiting to choose a government that can represent their will, and they will all be concentrated under the rule of a government that takes the interests of the country and the people as its premise. In other words, the Nanjing National Government now grasps the Chinese people's desire for peace and the Chinese people's long-cherished wish to oppose Anglo-American imperialism's invasion of China. If it can achieve practice from advocacy, then it will naturally make the people's minds in the Yu and Communist areas converge. Therefore, the policy of friendly people towards China, with the people's will as the target, is the most effective direction to directly strengthen the National Government.</p>
<p>Fourth, the people in the pacified areas are psychologically less chaotic than those under the rule of the Chongqing regime, and there are no political factions. We have discussed in detail yesterday the psychology of the people in the pacified areas. Regarding the peace movement, they have changed from an indifferent view to a recognition and belief that it may be successful. Therefore, the people in the pacified areas today have a unified psychology. As long as this point can be grasped and the belief can be further strengthened, there will be no problem in supporting the government's policy implementation. Therefore, today, the public opinion in the pacified areas is only concerned with the government, urging the government, with the sincerity of putting politics on the right track. This is the intention of the majority of the people, and there is no trace of factional struggle.</p>
<p>In summary, the intentions of the Chinese people will ultimately converge. At present, the intentions of the people in the pacified areas have been unified in recognizing and accepting the movement. As long as the government's politics are enlightened and can cooperate with this intention, then the intentions of the people under the rule of the Yu and Communist parties will inevitably converge, which is the success of complete peace. Therefore, we deeply hope that friendly people, under the principle of Sino-Japanese cooperation, recognize the importance of this "people's will"; at the same time, recognize the "simplicity" and "unanimity" of this intention, and determine the "correct cooperation" target, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a message from Brisbane: Australian Army Minister Ford warned at a reception for the press on Sunday evening, "If the Allied Nations do not correctly apply their strategy, Australia may be ravaged." He urged the Anti-Axis countries to send more troops, aircraft, and supplies to Australia, saying, "I frankly tell you that we are still in real danger of being attacked by Japan." He also said that Japan has increased its submarine strength in an attempt to cut off Australia's lines of communication.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from San Francisco: General Kenney, Commander of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Air Force, previously went to Washington to request US government and military leaders to strengthen aid to Australia. Now that Kenney has returned to his post, he recently spoke about the weakness of the Anti-Axis Air Force in the Pacific, saying that it takes a considerable amount of time to replenish even one aircraft for the Anti-Axis Air Force, so its numbers are actually inferior to the Japanese Air Force, and therefore we are also in a difficult situation. From this, it can be seen that Kenney's visit to the United States has failed, and it is difficult for American aid to Australia to be realized soon.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Yu Party's Yang Jie States: The Threat of Japanese Military Strength. Japan's Position in the Pacific Becomes More Solid. Calls on the Anti-Axis Countries to Pay Attention to Australia. <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Yu Party has constantly criticized the insistence of the United Kingdom and the United States on the Europe First strategy. Recently, it has repeatedly urged the United States and the United Kingdom to take measures to avert the crisis. Yang Jie, who has always been regarded as the Yu Party's number one strategist, published an article in the Chongqing Sweeping News on the 1st, saying that if the United Kingdom and the United States do not take any countermeasures, Japan's position in the Pacific will become more solid, clearly pointing out the threat of Japanese military strength. The general idea is: Japan calls this year the year of the decisive battle and is making solid preparations that can determine the fate of the Pacific. Therefore, Japan now seems to be actively building its southern occupied territories. The key to determining the Pacific War is Australia. If Japan conquers Australia and New Zealand, it will be difficult to shake Japan's position in the Pacific, even in the centuries to come. In this way, the Anti-Axis countries' strategy against Japan must be readjusted, and it will take a very long time to defeat Japan. Once Australia is occupied by Japan, Japan will not only no longer be a country lacking resources, but will become a country with abundant resources, and it will not be able to move its hair, even if it is to cope with any long-term war. Moreover, Japan has now included all the important islands in a semicircle north of Australia into its sphere of influence, so Australia is actually surrounded. Today, the Anti-Axis countries should reflect again. If they miss the opportunity, they will regret it too late.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from the front line in Central Hebei, since the Japanese army began a fierce attack on the strongholds of the 3rd Military Sub-district of the Yu army, it rushed into Shijiazhuang, the location of the army, and Zhangjiazhuang, the location of the Central Hebei Military Region Command, on the 2nd. Both places are 30 kilometers north of Tang County, and both areas have been turned into ruins due to the fierce bombing by Japanese army aircraft. After the Japanese army completely occupied the above two places, it continued to advance. The Tang River there has greatly increased in water volume due to the heavy rain in the previous days, but the Japanese army has now crossed the Tang River to pursue the remaining Yu army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from the front line in Central Hebei, after the Communist army entrenched in central Hebei was pursued by the Japanese army last spring and fled into the deep mountains in western Hebei Province, it set up the Central Hebei Military Region Command in Zhangjiazhuang, 30 kilometers north of Tang County. It is now known that Commander Lu Zheng was extremely embarrassed by the sudden attack by the Japanese army and seems to be attempting to escape alone. Since no one is in command of his troops, they have fallen into an extremely chaotic state.</p>

<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Report – Since the Ministry of Interior's Central Police Officer School began training police officers from all over the country, the police officers sent by various places have often been employees and clerks, learning patrol officers and acting patrol officers, etc., to make up for the training in Nanjing, which is not appropriate. Because these personnel are not clear about the basic knowledge of preliminary policing, the training results have not been excellent, and the country's money has been wasted in vain. In order to rectify this situation effectively, in the future, the trainees sent by various places must be formal patrol officers or formal police officers who have served for more than six months before they can be selected. The Ministry of Interior yesterday issued a special order to all police agencies across the country to strictly abide by it.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the National Government joined the war, its international status has been increasing day by day. Our friendly neighbor, Japan, was the first to declare the return of the exclusive concession and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. On the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it put it into concrete practice. Later, France, Switzerland, and others also responded. Our country's independence and autonomy have thus been completed.

This meeting took the concrete issue of abolishing extraterritorial rights as the important content of the discussion, bringing together judicial, procuratorial, and consular officials from North China, Central China, and South China to discuss the judicial and procuratorial affairs after the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The benefits to our country's independent sovereignty are greatly expected. Amid the victories of the Greater East Asia War, the close cooperation between China and Japan will surely make greater progress.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – In order to discuss preparations for the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry has decided to convene a meeting of judicial and procuratorial consular officials stationed in China at the conference room of the Japanese Embassy in China here on the 4th.

<h3 id="e20">New Weapon in Japanese War Science (3): Manufacturing Equipment for Fuze Parts <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Any invention is by no means achieved in a day or two. It requires a long period of arduous training and the dedication of a lifetime before any clue can be seen! Mr. Shoichi Teruichi, recipient of the Army Technological Achievement Award, embodies this undeniable truth. Born in Nagase Village, Kawachi County, Osaka Prefecture, he defied his parents' wishes to apprentice him after graduating from the village's elementary school, choosing a different path.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he worked at the Sakaue precious metal refining industry and the Fujiwara dental machinery industry. Although the Battle of Mukden during the Russo-Japanese War resulted in a great victory, it was achieved through manpower, not the strength of weapons. Recognizing the inadequacy of Japanese weaponry, Shoichi was inspired and resolutely entered the Osaka Artillery Arsenal in April of the 38th year of Meiji (1905).</p>
<p>Since its merger with the Shell Manufacturing Plant, the Osaka Artillery Arsenal seemed to have begun manufacturing shell fuzes. The fuze injects life into a round iron block, turning it into a shell. With a fuze, a shell can penetrate thick iron plates and instantly reduce people and objects to ashes. During the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War, Japan skillfully overcame the enemy's "material" strength with its vigorous and intense spirit, but at a considerable cost. The Japanese army suffered 200,000 casualties, while the Russian army suffered 140,000 (including 80,000 prisoners). This great sacrifice in the Russo-Japanese War illustrates how the Japanese army fought fiercely against enemies equipped with superior firearms, using their flesh and blood.</p>
<p>If the Japanese side had also possessed excellent weapons, the number of casualties could have been greatly reduced. Therefore, Shoichi, a fuze manufacturing worker, dedicated all his energy to his work and became Japan's only fuze worker. On his days off, he went to other factories, trying every possible way to learn in secret workshops. Every important factory in and out of the city was visited by Shoichi. His careful and prudent character, his tenacious enthusiasm in starting a task and not stopping until he fully understood it—all based on the spirit of "serving the nation"—soon allowed his talent to stand out and gain recognition from his superiors.</p>
<p>He was only thirty-eight years old when he was awarded for inventing the Type 88 small shell base fuze cover screw. He was neither a young inventor nor a genius inventor; it was not until middle age, at the age of thirty-eight, that he produced an invention.</p>
<p>For half his life, he worked with machines, which led to his current position. One cannot be careless with machines, and machines cannot have unfinished states. The completion of an invention is not due to its peculiarity that wins people's praise or surprise, but entirely for its practical utility. One completed invention can serve as a bridge for completing the second.</p>
<p>Instantaneous fuze firing pin cover, pressing for charge chamber bottom, safety pins for various fuzes, automatic screw cutting machine, and various automatic machines that use machines to replace manual manufacturing of various fuzes were all completed thanks to his efforts. It laid the foundation for mass production and endured the long-term attrition warfare of modern times. Fuzes can be divided into timed fuzes and instantaneous fuzes based on their function; they can also be divided into nose fuzes and base fuzes based on their assembly position. Timed fuzes begin to operate at the moment of firing, sensing the impact within the gun barrel, and the shell explodes after a few seconds. Instantaneous fuzes explode upon impact with the target due to vibration. Further subdivisions include instantaneous, short delay, tracer, and medium-range fuzes.</p>
<p>Instantaneous fuzes explode the moment the shell reaches the ground but before it sinks into it. Short-delay fuzes explode five to six meters or ten meters above the enemy's head. When fired, the shell's acceleration is equivalent to hundreds of times the Earth's gravity, and its rotation speed reaches over 20,000 revolutions per minute. Naval guns commonly have fuzes installed on the nose of the shell, while armor-piercing shells for army guns that target tanks and fortified positions have their fuzes installed on the base. During the Nomonhan Incident, the enemy's blindly advancing tank battalions and their fortified positions were destroyed by these base fuzes.</p>
<p>In addition to receiving thirteen awards of merit, Shoichi has also received fifteen awards for diligence. For forty years, except for business trips and holidays, he has not left his post for a single day. His second son, Private First Class Shoichi, died in action during the fierce battle of Mount Daibetsu in May of the 14th year of Showa (1939).

<h3 id="e21">Establishing Wartime Economic Measures: Japanese Cabinet Passes Three Plans <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese government, in order to establish various economic measures during the decisive battle period, has drafted various national plans for this year. First, at the regular cabinet meeting on the 30th of last month, the Material Mobilization Plan and the Transportation Mobilization Plan were submitted and formally decided by the cabinet. Today, at the regular cabinet meeting convened in advance, three plans, including the Production Expansion Plan, Power Mobilization Plan, and National Mobilization Plan, were also formally decided by the cabinet. The Japanese Information Bureau specifically released a statement by Suzuki, the President of the Planning Board, regarding the fundamental policy of this year's Production Expansion Plan at 4:00 PM today, which mainly stated: (1) The focus of this plan is to increase the production of steel, coal, light and heavy metals, warships, and aircraft. Efforts will also be made to strengthen and maintain the balance of important national defense industries related to the above-mentioned production. (2) Actively strengthen ships, vehicles, and land and sea transportation facilities, and, considering the storage conditions of raw materials and local conditions, establish various production countermeasures on the premise of conserving maritime transportation capacity. (3) For materials with extremely high demand and low self-sufficiency, make every effort to investigate, develop, or increase production within the vast Greater East Asia. (4) Improve domestic and foreign industries and utilize various industrial equipment and materials to actively increase productivity. (5) Make every effort to increase the production of major food crops necessary to ensure the wartime livelihood of the people, and so on. Furthermore, the plan's guidelines for implementing national mobilization this year are: (1) The focus of this plan is to expand military demand and increase the production and transportation of five major essential materials and other urgent materials, and to ensure the necessary personnel for the above-mentioned projects. (2) To expand the supply of administrative manpower, and to ensure timely and appropriate placement, restrict or prohibit men from filling positions as clerks or in lighter tasks that can be handled by women. Additionally, reorganize unnecessary schools, strengthen the implementation of national conscription, and expand the organization of the National Labor Service Corps to engage in forceful mobilization. (3) Improvement of industries necessary for national mobilization should be carried out quickly and vigorously.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japan International Cultural Association held a report meeting at the Imperial Hotel here at noon today, inviting representatives of the cultural mission group who had decided to go to China to attend the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Literary Association. Except for Mr. Ikezaki and Mr. Kawakami, who were absent, all others attended. Representatives from various related organizations such as the Japan Greater East Asia Ministry Information Bureau also sent personnel to participate. During the meeting, each person expressed their impressions and spoke freely. In particular, Mr. Kiyoshi Nobutoki's report that few Japanese people knew about the Chinese national anthem was a common feeling among the participants. At that time, specific methods for popularizing it were considered. The main points of each representative's report are recorded below. (Mr. Tetsuzo Tanikawa) This congress, because it was the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, failed to thoroughly discuss Sino-Japanese cultural issues, which is deeply regrettable. I hope that a Sino-Japanese cultural discussion meeting can be convened separately next year. (Mr. Todao Ogushi) Japanese cultural life has recently tended towards Europe and the United States, and has not paid much attention to neighboring China. This is not only the case for individuals, but also for the International Cultural Promotion Association and other organizations. As a result of attending this congress, I have become more fond of Chinese people, and the other party also hopes to establish active contact with Japan. Therefore, I hope to publish cultural magazines related to China and establish an organization to promote communication between Sino-Japanese cultures as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Overseas Chinese Assist in Construction Work: An Overview of Economic Progress in the Philippines <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency) May 7th marked the first anniversary of the pacification of the Philippines. Recent economic measures on the island have made progress, and the increase in local autonomy is particularly noteworthy. A brief introduction is provided below: "Establishing Comprehensive Price Countermeasures" The Japanese military administration will begin to improve price countermeasures after the start of the military administration's fiscal year and will establish a Price Countermeasures Committee to formulate an outline of price control and establish a procedure for price countermeasures. After comprehensively studying currency production and other issues, prices will be determined. Therefore, the committee's future activities are highly anticipated. "Increasing Bank Deposit Interest Rates" The Philippine Island Bank Association previously agreed to increase deposit interest rates, which have been implemented since May 1st. This will contribute greatly to absorbing floating purchasing power from the public. "Enhancing Local Autonomy" The officials of the Philippine executive branch, in order to make the Philippines a relay base for the southern front, have actively sought food production. In order to increase the industrial production capacity on the island, equipment for textiles, strong soda, and various daily necessities is also ready. The harvest of cotton in the first year was 15,000 dans, and the local cotton industry production plan has been successful.</p>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>In the past, overseas Chinese in the Philippines monopolized the entire Philippine economy with their tight economic organization. However, today, they deeply understand the meaning of building East Asia and are gradually changing their past practices, unanimously and enthusiastically supporting the National Government, and actively striving to make the most rational progress in order to adapt to the new situation after the expulsion of British and American forces. The goal of the Greater East Asia War is to establish a new world order, so the exploitation mechanisms and self-interest economic organizations of British and American imperialism must be expelled, so that all countries and nations in the world can engage in their own affairs for a long time. At the current stage, the controls and reforms implemented in various departments to complete the war are necessary measures. Therefore, the Philippines today has undergone considerable reforms in political, economic, and industrial aspects compared to the past. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines, who in the past aimed to absorb Chinese interests, must also reform their economic organizations and institutions and start under a new outlook. Since June of last year, overseas Chinese in the Philippines have established overseas Chinese associations in six locations, including Manila, Cebu, Davao, Legazpi, and Baguio, as central organizations to cooperate in the construction of the new Philippines. They have also organized the registration and compilation of Baojia (collective responsibility system) for overseas Chinese in the Philippines to assist in maintaining local order.

<h3 id="e24">500,000 US Coal Miners to Resume Work Today: Miners Union President Declares Understanding Reached with Government <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: Lewis, the president of the US Coal Miners Union, issued an order on the 2nd for the 500,000 miners belonging to the union to resume work starting on the morning of the 4th. It is reported that the US government and the union's political committee are scheduled to negotiate a new contract and wage issues before the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from Washington, Lewis, the president of the US Workers Union, announced last night that the American mining strike would be postponed, saying that he had reached an agreement with the Washington government that the strike would be postponed for two weeks. The date for the general mining strike was originally set for today, as more than 500,000 miners had already stopped working last weekend. Lewis's announcement of the postponement of the strike came twenty minutes before President Roosevelt's appeal to the miners. According to Lewis, he had ordered his miners to resume work tomorrow to avoid plunging the country into chaos, and solemnly declared that this was the result of the current situation. Lewis also said that the postponement of the strike was a unanimous decision of the Mountain Miners Union's "policy committee." When Lewis declared to the miners, he urged them to remember that the American government was their only employer and deeply hoped that the government and the entire American nation would deeply understand the significance of the miners' demands. President Roosevelt had not formally received any news about Lewis's meeting with the US government, which was held before the Miners Union president made this announcement. Therefore, although the postponement of the strike was announced before Lewis's appeal, Roosevelt did not mention this point in his broadcast address at first. At the request of the government, Lewis had previously discussed the matter with Fuel Secretary Ickes for two hours, and it is generally believed that the postponement of the strike was likely due to the mine owners having agreed to the miners' demands for increased wages.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Roosevelt Appeals to Miners to Return to Work <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, Today (Central News Agency) Washington News: Because the White House order requiring all striking miners to return to work before 10 AM on Saturday was resisted by Lewis, the president of the Miners Union, President Roosevelt tonight again made an urgent appeal to the 500,000 striking miners in the East, denouncing them for staking the lives of American soldiers and the safety of the people on a single throw, and indicated that if the strikers did not obey the order to return to work, he would take stern action. He added that the war had reached a new crisis stage, and any delay in coal production would affect the progress of the war effort. President Roosevelt also invoked the strikers' patriotism, continuing, "Fellow Americans, I am speaking to the American people tonight, and especially to those of our citizens who are coal miners. Our country is now facing a serious danger. The future of the country depends on the victorious outcome of the war in which we are now participating." President Roosevelt also said that he had recently toured more than twenty states in two weeks and had witnessed tens of thousands of workers manufacturing aircraft, artillery, and ammunition, all engaged in difficult work for long hours, and their living conditions were very difficult. Our current collective effort is not excessive for the current war. We will need everything from ourselves and our allies. We have not yet won the war; only by intensifying production and mobilizing all our strength for the war effort can we win. The suspension of domestic coal production, even for a very short period of time, is tantamount to staking the lives of soldiers at sea and on land and the future safety of the nation on a single throw, and this gamble is unwarranted, unnecessary, and extremely dangerous. Therefore, I am making a declaration to all miners and to the American people at home and abroad that coal production must not be allowed to stop. President Roosevelt pointed out that his speech was to invoke the patriotism of all miners and traced back to the events after the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the three major labor organizations in the United States—the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Railway Brotherhoods—all vowed not to strike during the war, and Lewis was also a participant in this guarantee. Roosevelt also pointed out that in the current coal industry strike, attempts at mediation had failed, and the matter had been submitted to the War Labor Board, but the Miners Union had refused to participate on the grounds that the board was prejudiced. Therefore, the responsibility for this strike clearly lies with the Miners Union and not with the US government. The consequence of this arbitrary action is that we are all threatened by it. He is well aware that the high cost of living has troubled the families of miners and millions of other workers, and the government has decided not to allow the cost of living to rise as it did during the last war and has decided to maintain a balance between wages and prices. We have not yet lowered the prices of certain goods, not only in coal-producing areas, but also in many other cities. Violators of price restrictions will be dealt with strictly. The war is currently underway, and all miners should set aside their personal opinions and continue to work in their positions, because we must supply weapons to the troops overseas. If any patriotic miners need protection to resume work, they will be given full and proper guarantees. If it is necessary for the military to manage the mines and protect the returning miners and their families, it will be done for the sake of the nation and especially for the needs of the soldiers in the army, navy, and air force. President Roosevelt concluded with a hopeful remark, saying that he believed that all miners would not continue to strike, but at the same time issued a warning, "The meaning of my words is not to neglect my duties as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy? The first thing I intend to do is to ensure that the coal mines resume work."</p>
<p>The Miners Union's Struggle</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: 450,000 workers belonging to the American Miners Union went on strike at midnight on the 30th on the orders of the union's president, Lewis, with tremendous momentum, which shocked President Roosevelt and left him at a loss. The Miners Union, led by Lewis, has a sound organization rarely seen in American labor history. When a strike occurred in the coal mines belonging to the steel companies in the autumn of 1941, the union insisted on its demands without making any concessions, causing a steel and iron plant in the Pittsburgh area to be forced to shut down due to insufficient coal. Later, President Roosevelt asked the workers to prioritize the country's future, and they resumed work. The current strike was caused by Lewis's demand on March 10 that the Price Adjustment Bureau raise the wages of miners nationwide due to high inflation and rising prices after American inflation, so that workers could work with peace of mind. The Union of Anthracite Mine Owners in northern America refused to accept this, which led to the current strike. Lewis was re-elected as president of the Miners Union this spring. During the industrial recovery era, he was very close to Roosevelt. Since Lewis left the Labor Union and formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1936, his power has grown due to Roosevelt's protective labor policies. Therefore, in order to repay the favor, he vigorously supported Roosevelt during the 1936 presidential election. Since then, the international situation has become increasingly urgent, and Lewis's isolated stance has become more pronounced. At the same time, Roosevelt's labor policy has also changed, causing the feelings between the two to become increasingly distant and gradually opposed. During the 1940 presidential election, Lewis publicly declared his support for Wilkie, which shocked the entire United States. After Wilkie failed to be elected, he resigned from the chairmanship of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and presided over the Miners Union with his daughter, Cassery.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Axis Forces Counterattack from Strongholds: British Forces' Sharp Momentum Halted: British Convoy Attacked Outside Benghazi <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) A military commentator from the Hai Tong News Agency stated today that the fierce attack launched by the anti-Axis forces in an attempt to drive the Axis forces out of Tunisia has now completely stalled. The situation in North Africa has not changed in the past few days. After the British army heavily bombarded the Axis positions northwest of Enfidaville with artillery on Thursday night and Friday morning, it launched an infantry attack on Friday afternoon, but this attack was only a small-scale battle of a local nature. Its purpose was obviously to change the positions or to contain the Axis forces in that area. The British infantry was then driven back to its original positions, and the bombardment by British artillery was greatly reduced. On Saturday, there were only a few skirmishes by scout teams in the south. The battle situation at Pont du Fahs was calm. The Majaz al Bab area was more active. The German army made some progress in a local attack northwest of the El Hamma salt lake. The enemy increased pressure on the highway from Majaz al Bab to Tebourba, but without significant progress. In the mountainous area between Medjez el Bab and the Mediterranean coast, American and French forces cooperated in combat, with only minor contact.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) Since the general offensive on the Tunisian front began on April 16, the anti-Axis forces have lost 294 tanks, 211 armored vehicles, 64 artillery pieces, and 53 aircraft up to April 30, and 1,700 people were captured. In addition, the tanks and aircraft destroyed by the Axis forces with anti-tank guns and fighter squadrons are not included in this list. Therefore, the losses suffered by the anti-Axis forces in this offensive were extremely heavy, and they have been unable to launch another offensive in the past few days. Integrated frontline news reports that (1) the Axis forces have completely occupied important mountain positions in the northern coastal area. The British army launched several reconnaissance attacks in the Medjez el Bab area, and there were frequent small clashes between the two armies; (2) The French rebels in the southwestern region received reinforcements and are working hard to strengthen their positions. It is reported that the Axis artillery is repeatedly bombarding them.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) According to German News Agency reports, military sources stated: The German military report on Sunday regarding the attack by German bombers on a British convoy off the coast of North Africa was an outstanding success. The enemy convoy was spotted by German long-range reconnaissance aircraft. Before 8:00 AM on May 1, German bombers flew near Benghazi and were covered by British fighters. An air battle immediately broke out. The German bombers then attacked the largest unit in the enemy convoy. A 6,000-ton freighter was hit and caught fire. Several medium-sized freighters were also damaged. Another 5,600-ton freighter was also directly hit. German bombers launched three aerial torpedoes, hitting a 10,000-ton mail ship, which immediately caught fire. The total loss of the mail ship is undoubtedly certain. Another 7,000-ton freighter was hit by a torpedo, tilted, and stopped sailing. It is feared that it will not be able to reach port. One German aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The Focus of Eastern Front Battles Shifts to the Kupiansk River Area; Soviet Forces' Five-Day Offensive Unsuccessful <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The main focus of battles on the Eastern Front has now shifted to the Kupiansk River area, with only localized engagements in other sectors and no major changes in the overall situation. According to frontline reports, the Soviet offensive against the Kupiansk bridgehead was well-organized and planned. Following heavy artillery and air strikes on German positions, large tank groups and infantry units were repeatedly launched in fierce assaults. After five days of intense fighting, the Soviet forces suffered enormous casualties and material losses, but achieved no results. The German positions remained unchanged. Furthermore, among the battles of the past five days, the one on the 2nd of this month was the most intense. From dawn that day, the German air force launched an offensive, destroying 42 Soviet aircraft by noon alone. In addition, German ground forces fought bravely against the superior Soviet forces, conducting suicidal attacks on Soviet tank formations, destroying 31 tanks. Also, it appears that the Soviet forces launched a new offensive in the Orel area, south of the central sector, on the 2nd. Although the Soviet Information Bureau has announced that Soviet troops have advanced into the area, the German side has not yet confirmed this.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Late-night news from the front last night hinted at potentially more intense fighting, but yesterday only saw battles in the Kupiansk and Orel areas. News from Moscow also stated that Soviet forces launched a new offensive in the Orel area, but this attack is still only of a localized nature. According to the Associated Press, Soviet forces occupied three radio stations between Smolensk and Kharkov. There was also some activity in the Kalinin area of the northern front, with both sides engaging in fierce melee combat in the trenches, but no significant changes to the frontline were observed.</p>

<h3 id="e34">U.S. Attempts to Occupy French Martinique, Has Announced Severance of Relations with the Island <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press report, reliable sources said today that diplomatic figures in Washington are actively discussing the possibility of U.S. military intervention in French Martinique. While there is no formal action on this step at present, influential figures in Washington have made informal overtures on the matter.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Washington, the U.S. government, because High Commissioner Robert of French Martinique remains loyal to the French government, severed relations with the island on the 26th. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, in a meeting with reporters on the 30th, stated that the U.S. government cannot yet specify what measures it will take against Martinique and the French warships moored in the island's waters after the severance of relations. The U.S. Navy is currently patrolling near the island, and observers stationed on the island will report on the situation there at any time. In addition to six oil tankers and two merchant ships, there are also the aircraft carrier "Béarn" (25,000 tons), the cruiser "D'Entrecasteaux" (6,496 tons), and the "Jeanne d'Arc" (5,886 tons) moored on the island. A portion of the French fleet has sailed to the port of Dakar, engaging in activities under U.S. command.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Dissident French elements in Washington believe that if Robert, the French commissioner of Martinique, does not accept U.S. demands, U.S. forces may occupy Martinique. Washington sources, quoting these elements, said that the United States will implement a military occupation based on the provisions of the Havana Treaty, and will recognize the Giraud-Lethière joint government established on the island to remove Commissioner Robert. At the same time, these elements pointed out that the U.S. cancellation of its agreement with Commissioner Robert is merely one step in its consistent policy of exerting pressure on Martinique to make the island join the anti-Axis front. The United States stopped shipping grain to Martinique last autumn, and on the 45th, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles announced to the world that if necessary, the United States was prepared to take military action. However, it is believed that Commissioner Robert will strongly resist any landing attempt. Information received here reveals that Robert, in addition to a portion of sailors on the repatriated French fleet, also has 3,000 soldiers. Martinique's defense equipment, in addition to the cannons on the French warships, also includes the machine guns of 105 aircraft from the aircraft carrier "Courageous."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to sources in London, General Giraud's letter to de Gaulle arrived in London last night. Giraud does not agree with de Gaulle's proposed political plan for the French government-in-exile. According to Reuters, Giraud does not approve of de Gaulle's proposed centralized organization. Giraud believes that the political aspects of this issue should be discussed at a later date, and that unity between the two factions should be limited to military and diplomatic matters. Giraud asked de Gaulle to meet in North Africa immediately, but at a location more secluded than Algiers. De Gaulle has now telegraphed General Catroux, who is mediating, expressing his agreement to meet immediately, but insists that it should be held in Algiers so that he can have daily contact with various figures.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, the Secretary of State for India issued a statement this morning announcing changes in senior personnel in the British Indian government. In addition to a reduction in the number of Indian cabinet members in the wartime cabinet, the High Commissioner has also been replaced. Sir Mudaliar, who represents India in the wartime cabinet, has been transferred back to the Executive Council of the Governor-General of India. Sir Huddleston, the Indian High Commissioner in London, has also been transferred back to the Executive Council of the Governor-General of India, and his vacant position will be filled by Sir Runganadhan, the former advisor to the Secretary of State for India. Sir Rowlands, the former Advocate-General of Bengal, and Dr. Khare have been appointed members of the Executive Council, with the latter also serving as Commissioner of Overseas Affairs. Ahmed has been appointed Minister of Information and Broadcasting. Mudaliar is also Commissioner of Supply. Huddleston is also Commissioner of Commerce. The reason for the above reorganization is that three cabinet members resigned when Gandhi began his fast, and there is now a need to fill the vacancies. As for the position of India's representative in the wartime cabinet in London, as Sir Mudaliar will not leave England for several weeks, there are no plans to appoint another person to replace him at present.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Anglo-American Monetary Debate: Anglo-American Conflict on Post-War Currency <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>On April 5th, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau officially released the post-war currency plan. Then, on the 7th, British economist Keynes also released a proposal of the same nature, revealing the deep conflict of opinions between Britain and the United States on this issue. The detailed content of the two plans is not yet clear, but summarizing various fragments of reports, the points of conflict are mainly the following three:</p>
<p>(1) Different Views on Gold - The Morgenthau plan extends the concept of the Exchange Equalization Fund, using 500 million "Unitas" (a newly established international monetary unit, with one "Unitas" equivalent to ten U.S. dollars, freely convertible with gold) to establish an international exchange equalization mechanism. The currencies of various countries maintain a certain exchange ratio with gold through "Unitas." This equalization fund is used to prevent drastic changes in the international exchange market, and the difference between buying and selling exchanges is settled in cash. Clearing agreements are not recognized without special permission. The Keynes plan extends the concept of clearing agreements in the form of a clearinghouse, establishing an international financial hub. International settlements only need to transfer an entry in the accounting books of this central institution. This is the theoretical basis of currency management. As for the role of gold, it is used as the final means of settlement, with "Bancor" as the value benchmark for the international currency unit.</p>
<p>(2) Issue of Speaking Rights in the International Financial Hub - The Morgenthau plan uses gold, foreign exchange holdings, and national income as the basis for determining the funds that should be invested in the central institution. The Keynes plan uses the trade volume in the three years before the war as the basis. Obviously, the former is beneficial to the United States, while the latter is beneficial to Britain.</p>
<p>(3) Different Post-War Trade Plans - According to the Morgenthau plan, the exchange rates of various countries cannot be lowered without the permission of the central institution. If there are difficulties in maintaining parity, it will be settled with gold. According to the Keynes plan, if a country's overdraft exceeds a certain limit within a certain period, it is allowed to automatically lower its currency value because lowering the currency value can promote exports. In other words, commodity exports are used as the final means of international settlement.</p>
<p>The Theory of Submitting to Politics</p>
<p>The truth of the above-mentioned issues shows that it lies not in economics but in politics. According to Keynes' clearinghouse proposal, the deficit party in the settlement uses commodity exports as the final handling method, so the "Bancor" unit he assumed does not necessarily have to be linked to gold. This is to prevent the gold-producing South African Union from leaning towards the United States. Judging from Keynes' previous theory, it is a kind of degradation, a submission to politics.</p>
<p>But the Keynes plan also has its limits. If it restores the gold standard, the British Empire will have no room to intervene under the U.S. gold hegemony. Therefore, it came up with a compromised and eclectic plan, which is neither complete currency management nor completely based on gold.</p>
<p>The Self-Interested Morgenthau Plan</p>
<p>The distribution of gold in the world is now completely biased towards the United States. If it is not redistributed, it will be difficult to hope for the stability of the currencies of various countries based on gold. This is the difficulty of the Morgenthau plan. The United States believes that gold will no longer be distributed to various countries in the world, and to put it bluntly, the United States hopes that various countries will exchange their military bases, or political and economic interests, for gold.</p>
<p>In fact, what the Keynes plan implies is to make the United States an importing country, with various countries exporting goods to the United States, and the United States releasing gold. This is indeed a true balance. However, the United States itself will experience a phenomenon of overproduction after the war, so how can it accommodate the dumping of goods from various countries in the United States? Here, after the direct currency issue, the gold issue closely follows.</p>
<p>Before the war, the United States established the world's highest tariff barriers, with an internal free market of 9 million square kilometers and 130 million people. Everything can be done immediately. This is completely different from Europe, where a one-day train ride involves crossing several political, economic, and cultural borders. In the United States, no matter where you go, the language, customs, habits, and thoughts are all the same, and the basic characteristics of the U.S. economy are unified standards, industrial rationalization, and mass production. Only the British Empire group wants to confront it, and the difference is too great. The fundamental reason is that the group members scattered around the world cannot be defended militarily. Therefore, a European wide-area sphere - that Britain wants to dominate politically, economically, and militarily - is necessary no matter what.</p>
<p>This economic trend of Britain was politically expressed as the term "European Family" in Churchill's speech on March 21st. The meaning of "European Family" is that the sovereignty of small countries can no longer exist as before.</p>
<p>European Wide-Area Sphere Theory</p>
<p>The United States previously held suspicions and anxieties about the League of Nations and the Pan-European movement, and is now observing the British movement with the same eyes. The U.S. Lend-Lease program – becoming the true meaning of the arsenal and granary of democratic countries – is to maintain absolute superiority in military power and productivity in the post-war world. The U.S. plan still adheres to the Monroe Doctrine and uses it as the core for developing towards the world market and the world economy.</p>
<p>This plan is expressed politically in the free trade doctrine and national self-determination doctrine in the Atlantic Charter. Upon closer examination, this is the free movement of U.S. capital and U.S. goods, which is the basis for opposing the European wide-area theory.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Anxiety</p>
<p>The ambitions of Britain and the United States for the post-war world have been exposed through the currency debate. This is an anxious expression of the need to enhance combat power at the current stage of the decisive battle.</p>
<p>(1) Thinking about the major problem of post-war overproduction, Britain and the United States - especially the United States - want to prevent increased production. However, this overthinking cannot but be rejected at present. The rumored anti-Axis agricultural conference is one of the manifestations of this effort.</p>
<p>(2) U.S. politicians and capitalists will not be able to work with peace of mind unless they eliminate their concerns about the gold hidden in the Kentucky Mountains, which once becomes worthless.</p>
<p>(3) If the post-war issue is raised, the currency issue cannot be avoided, and the United States cannot but advocate the gold standard. The United States also knew that Keynes was drafting a currency plan, so it launched it first, so that the people would get the impression that the United States has leadership in the international economy, and improve their confidence in the government. The prior launch of the gold standard advocacy is a manifestation of the anxiety of Britain and the United States, especially the United States.

<h3 id="e39">Anglo-American International Monetary Disputes <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The anti-Axis powers' ideas about postwar management often gloss over the fact of defeat. This deception is a propaganda tactic, aimed at spreading the illusion of an assured victory in this war throughout the world. However, it has resulted in political and economic opposition between Britain and the United States, exposing contradictions and divisions within their own camp. This is truly a gratifying development.</p>
<p>A recent prominent example is the ugly dispute between Britain and the United States over the postwar international monetary security plan. This issue originated with Keynes' proposal for international monetary reform. Keynes is a world-renowned economist and currently a director of the Bank of England. After Britain submitted this proposal to the pre-determined anti-Axis financial conference in London, it was officially published this month, on the 7th, by Finance Minister Wood in the form of a white paper. In response, the United States, as expected, showed its displeasure and issued a rebuttal. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau wants to replace Keynes' proposal with his assistant Harry Dexter White's "Proposal for a Stabilizing Fund of the United and Associated Nations." On the 5th of this month, Morgenthau presented it at a joint closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Banking and Currency Committee, and the Postwar Economic Policy and Planning Committee.</p>
<p>The content of Keynes' proposal is based on the following five main points: (1) Establishing an International Clearing Bank with hubs in London and New York; (2) Establishing an international accounting unit based on gold, called "Bancor"; (3) Creating an international commodity association mechanism; (4) Establishing an international investment institution; (5) Drafting an international economic plan. In other words, it is to establish an international monetary system based on gold for settling international trade, with "Bancor" as its monetary unit. Based on the maintenance or change of gold price controls, Britain and the United States would be responsible for its operation, thereby setting international commodity prices. Thus, each country can determine the external value of its own currency based on Bancor. The contributions of member countries to the International Clearing Bank would be converted into Bancor, deposited as reserves, and recorded in the books for exchange settlement between countries. Furthermore, to maintain a stable relationship between Bancor, commodities, and gold, an international commodity regulatory agency would be established to engage in the purchase of surplus materials and the release of existing goods. It also aims to develop and industrialize economically backward countries and to meet the capital needs of countries lacking financial funds. The International Investment Institution would provide financial assistance in the form of international loans to countries with trade deficits in the aforementioned multilateral exchange clearing system based on Bancor, to aid postwar economic recovery. Moreover, to ensure the smooth operation of international clearing on a permanent basis, an international-scale economic plan would be drafted to ensure international economic equilibrium.</p>
<p>In contrast, White's proposal focuses on the revival of the international gold standard, with gold controlling the currencies of all countries in the world from beginning to end. A world currency stabilization fund would be established through contributions from various countries, and an International Monetary Control Board would be created, managed by an international supervisory committee. It advocates a new international monetary unit, "Unitas" (set at an equivalent of ten US dollars and freely convertible to gold), on the condition that member countries are prohibited from freely devaluing their currencies. It also declares that the United States will spend half of the exchange balance fund, 5 billion US dollars, to facilitate trade transactions between countries. The true intention of the United States, needless to say, is to rescue the gold worth hundreds of millions of dollars, scraped from all over the world and now hidden in Fort Knox in Kentucky, as well as the American gold mining industry that was shut down during the war.</p>
<p>As pointed out in a special dispatch published in the evening edition of this newspaper (Yomiuri Hochi claims) on the 17th, Keynes' proposal is to link the settlement currency unit Bancor to gold, negate the restoration of the gold standard in its strict sense, and advocate the reorganization of the world economy through a multilateral exchange clearing system. This is completely close to the Axis powers' idea of establishing a world economy by using non-gold currencies. In terms of the basic concept of international economics, it can be said to be imitating the Axis powers. However, Britain, which has already fallen from the throne of the world economy, wants to flatter the United States, so it wants to thoroughly place the foundation of international currency on the gold standard. Now it is expressing its reluctance to part with the gold standard, so the function of its multilateral exchange clearing system cannot be developed after all. In other words, due to the constraints of gold, most countries still have to be under the hegemonic monopoly of the international economy of Britain and the United States. Therefore, if Keynes truly intends to rebuild the world economy, he will naturally have to be consistent with the direction of the Axis powers' new world order. Furthermore, the United States' imperialistic ambition and its self-serving attitude are deeply resented by us as it seeks to solve its own gold storage problem by using the pretext of rebuilding the world currency, and to fully restore the international gold standard of "Unitas," with the immediate abolition of exchange restrictions, restrictions on the movement of unsound capital, and the prohibition of clearing agreements as preconditions, and thereby to restore the pre-war international economic order and rebuild its own prosperity.</p>
<p>Today's world economy is gradually shifting from a gold standard economy to a commodity standard economy, and the gold standard has already been negated by history. As this war is raging, East Asia and Europe are carrying out the magnificent construction of a wide-area financial zone through the conclusion of exchange clearing systems centered on their central countries. Moreover, the value ratio established between countries within the new zone is the most appropriate currency value for the smooth exchange of materials within the zone without relying on gold, so that a self-sufficient relationship of coexistence and co-prosperity can be established. Through the adjustment of planned settlement measures by the guiding countries, it is gradually leading to an economic structure of shared destiny. Not only that, but even in trade between friendly zones, like the Japan-Germany payment agreement, gold has been excluded. At this stage of economic history, it can be said that even the final stronghold of gold as a means of payment between zones has been severely limited, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The reconstruction of the world economy by a wide-area economy, as advocated by the Axis powers, is possible if trust is established between the guiding countries of each zone, mutual consultation is made to conclude payment agreements for the adjustment of materials, and a certain amount of credit borrowing is allowed for unavoidable payment differences. We believe that this is the inevitable result of history. (Ding: Translated from Yomiuri Hochi, April 21)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Director of the Materials Compilation Office Issues Statement: Investigation of Rumors of Corruption by Investigators – Punishment Guaranteed if Found – Hope that Businessmen from All Circles Will Exercise Self-Restraint – Do Not Attempt to Bribe to Avoid Penalties <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau issued a notice at the end of last month, stating that ten investigators from the Materials Control Office would be dismissed and their names and photos published. This matter has attracted great attention from all circles in the city, but because the reasons for the dismissal were not explained, there have been many speculations, some of which are quite sensational. Inagaki Noboru, Director of the Materials Control Office, believing that the outside world's groundless speculation is prone to causing various rumors, specially issued a written statement yesterday, expressing the Public Works Bureau's attitude towards the work of the investigators. He also hopes that businessmen from all circles will cooperate and not allow investigators to have any opportunity to commit dereliction of duty and corruption. The full text of the statement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Employees Guilty of Corruption Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>"Recently, there have been rumors that employees of this Materials Control Office have been using their positions to solicit money from businessmen or accept gifts from businessmen. I was deeply saddened to hear about this. After conducting a thorough investigation, we have not yet obtained solid evidence to prove that any employee of this office has accepted bribes. However, this office does not ignore certain cases simply because solid evidence has not been obtained. For example, employees are asked to leave their posts if they are suspected of corruption due to observations of their daily life, appearance, and actions. Therefore, if evidence of corruption is obtained, we will cooperate with the police to take legal action against the employee, even if he has already left the Bureau. The Bureau has already taken severe measures against merchants who seek excessive profits or violate price limits, so it goes without saying that employees of the Bureau should be dealt with severely.</p>
<p>Merchants Must Not Attempt to Bribe</p>
<p>The Bureau will continue to do its best to cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere among its employees, thereby proving the rumors that employees of this office abuse their positions to be untrue. However, maintaining a clean and honest atmosphere cannot be achieved without the full cooperation of the citizens. It is hoped that merchants will exercise self-restraint and not bribe employees of this office in an attempt to evade penalties or operate illegally. It must be understood that one bribery case is enough to affect the reputation and credibility of millions of people. The Bureau has always notified citizens to pay attention to those who impersonate employees of the Materials Control Office and not to be fooled by them. These swindlers have not yet disappeared, and it is hoped that all parties concerned will pay great attention to them.</p>
<p>Procedures for Issuing Removal Permits Can Be Inquired About</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the work of the Bureau's removal permit office, I would like to explain as follows: Currently, only two items, cotton yarn and cotton cloth, require a removal permit. The issuance of removal permits is very systematic, so that employees have no opportunity to engage in corruption. Outside rumors that a certain amount of money must be paid to apply for this permit are purely nonsense. Those who spread such rumors have other intentions. Citizens who are still unclear about applying for a yarn and cloth removal permit should contact the Materials Control Office of this Bureau at Office No. 191 for inquiries."</p>
<h3 id="e41">All Citizens Must Be Injected Before the 18th – Disease Prevention Campaign Enters Third Week <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The citywide disease prevention campaign has entered its third week. More than 10,000 residents of this city have been injected. The relevant authorities will intensify their efforts to ensure that all residents of the city receive preventative injections before May 18.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Work in Various Districts of the City</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the disease prevention campaign, the authorities of the Public Concession launched a street cleaning campaign last Saturday. The health authorities of the French Concession will increase the number of injection teams by fifteen, for a total of twenty-one, and send them to densely populated areas to help the Baojia organizations provide services. The first phase of the disease prevention campaign in the Binbei District has ended, and the second phase will begin today, with special publicity to explain how to improve hygiene, maintain cleanliness, and prevent disease.</p>
<p>The Hudong Area is Planning to Establish a Pandemic Hospital</p>
<p>The Hudong area is full of factories, densely populated, and mostly poor. Once they get sick, they will be helpless. There is no pandemic hospital or isolation hospital in the Hudong area, which has a large population. In case of an emergency, patients must be sent to the city center for treatment, but at this time, when there is a lack of fast cars, it is very inconvenient. It is now heard that Yuan Judeng and Wang Boyuan of Wenlanting are organizing a Chinese pandemic hospital, which is being prepared in the Hudong area. It has been supported by the authorities, and it is hoped that gentlemen from all walks of life will do their best to help make this a voluntary effort and benefit the sick.</p>
<p>Physical Examination for Chinese Nannies</p>
<p>In order to maintain the health of infants, a certain pharmaceutical school in Shanghai conducted physical examinations of infants in the Hongkou district last Saturday. In the past, an infant in the Hongkou district died of tuberculosis. After examination, it was discovered that the disease was transmitted by a Chinese nanny. Tomorrow and the day after, 1,000 nannies employed by Japanese residents in the Hongkou district will continue to be examined.</p>

<p>According to news from the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Police Headquarters of the Joint Concession Public Works Bureau, the allocation of fuel to automobiles or freight vehicles (trucks) equipped with charcoal or coal engines was announced in the Bureau's Announcement No. 6294. The car owners have already filled out the application forms, and everything is now in sight, and it will be implemented soon. However, most car owners have not yet received the application forms for June. The section intends to deprive those who have not applied of their allocation quota starting from the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of increasing rickshaw fares, it is reported that the city authorities are still studying the matter because the amount of the increase requested by the rickshaw companies is too large. At a time when the authorities are trying their best to suppress prices, in order to take care of the business of each company and avoid increasing the burden on passengers, they cannot but consider both aspects. The rickshaw guild recently published a notice in the newspaper that it had been ordered to increase fares. The city authorities stated that they had not approved it, so how could the guild claim to have been "ordered?" They have been ordered to correct it. They have also been instructed to continue to collect fares according to the old rules until they have been approved, in order to emphasize the power of the law.</p>
<h3 id="e44">City Education Bureau Holds Japanese Teacher Training Course – Selects and Assigns Eighty People to Attend <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>With the assistance of the Shanghai Japanese Language Education Research Association, the City Education Bureau will hold the first session of the Japanese language teacher training course for primary and secondary schools from May 1 to June 30. Eighty current Chinese Japanese language teachers from public and private primary and secondary schools will be selected and assigned to attend.

Each Japanese language teacher will attend the class for one day, and the association will provide transportation expenses every day, as well as free books and lecture notes. Director Lin of the Education Bureau will serve as the president of the association. The opening ceremony will be held on May 1, and classes will officially begin on May 2. The list of responsible personnel and lecturers of the association is as follows: 1. President: Director Lin of the Education Bureau. 2. Dean: Ma Jinren. Deputy Dean: Arima Heizo Saburo. 3.

<h3 id="e45">Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Cooperative – Full Allocation, Severe Punishment for Refusal to Sell – Personnel Will Soon Be Dispatched to the Suburbs of Shanghai to Implement <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>In order to fully distribute cigarettes and maintain city sales, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Cooperative stipulates that the goods will be dispatched three times a month, in the first, middle, and last ten days. It was recently announced that the fourth phase of dispatch will begin on the 5th, and all wholesalers and retailers have been notified to pay and pick up the goods at the distribution centers and Da Tong Bank. From now on, the dispatched goods will be sold in ten days, with one-tenth being sold on average every day. In order to prevent hoarding, reselling, and profiteering, the business of each distributor will be strictly supervised. All supervisors have been mobilized to check whether distributors are hoarding or refusing to sell. Those who violate the regulations will be given penalties such as suspension of distribution or forced closure, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Anyone who discovers that any licensed cigarette sales store has illegal refusal to sell behavior is allowed to report to the cooperative or the nearest police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Amount of Fourth Phase Dispatch Increased Appropriately</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the demand for cigarettes exceeds the supply, the cooperative has appropriately increased the amount of the fourth phase dispatch. The goods are distributed in a four-level system of A, B, C, and D. The goods distributed include products from Zhonghua Tobacco Company, China Tobacco Company, and Huashang Datong, Fuxin, Nanyang, and Huacheng factories. The goods are only sold at the licensed stores and absolutely no illegal acts such as reselling are allowed. The supervisors are very serious in their random inspections, and they have prepared sales reports for each store for verification. The dispatch of goods in the suburbs of Shanghai will be implemented this month, and all registration matters for wholesalers have been completed. The dispatch of goods in other parts of Huazhong will be handled by the local branch of the cooperative. The selling price of cigarettes is completely the same everywhere, so after the cooperative's organization is sound, the cigarette black market will inevitably disappear, and resellers will have no profit to make.</p>
<p>Person in Charge Talks About Cigarette Price Limits</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Tobacco Cooperative, the cooperative has been ordered to handle cigarette distribution for a short time, but it is working hard and does not dare to be selfish. However, it is suffering from registered merchants who refuse to comply with the price limits for selling cigarettes and falsely claim that the cigarette price limits have not yet been announced. This statement is actually specious. The cooperative has long announced the price of cigarettes. The price of some cigarettes that have not yet been announced will be announced in the shortest possible time. If any wholesaler or retailer sells cigarettes at a price that does not conform to the publicly set price, the cooperative will fulfill its responsibilities and severely punish them, and it is hoped that the police authorities and people from all walks of life will provide assistance.</p>
<p>Manipulation and Forced Purchase Should Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Cigarette distribution has already been implemented, but ordinary smokers have not yet received the benefit of distributed cigarettes at parity prices. The sale of parity-priced cigarettes is either manipulated by retail stores or snatched up by those who rely on force to "squeeze purchases." In addition to striving for fair distribution, the distribution authorities will eliminate this phenomenon.</p>

<p>A newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, and public opinion is a reflection of the will of the people. Based on this point of view, this newspaper has opened a "Reader Forum" and publicly provided space for readers to convey their opinions. However, reviewing the content, we feel that it is mostly biased towards local issues. In order to further expand the scope, it will be renamed "National Forum" from now on. As the name implies, it is not difficult for us to understand the purpose. All suggestions and criticisms related to politics, economy, education, culture, and social undertakings that are constructive are welcome. Once disclosed, a generous reward will be given. However, due to the limited space, the number of words in the submitted articles should be within 2,000 words. We hope you will understand.</p>
<h3 id="e48">National Forum – Banning the Nanshi Gambling Houses <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Chengkang</p>
<p>At a time when public opinion is unanimously demanding that silk speculation and the hoarding of opium and gambling be banned, the government authorities have already heeded the public's wishes and thoroughly investigated the speculators in Shanghai. Although it still needs to continue to work hard to achieve the expected results, this alone is enough to make the treacherous merchants feel cold and frightened, and slightly restrain their rampant and fierce flames, which makes us sing praises!</p>
<p>The Nanshi gambling houses, which have the same harm as speculation and hoarding, have not yet heard of any action from the authorities and are still allowed to exist逍遥. According to statistics, an average of 60 people per day go bankrupt and become beggars because of this. The increasing number of criminal cases in this city is mostly related to gambling. We are very sorry about this.</p>
<p>What is most surprising is the "Special Club Management Office" specially established to manage the gambling dens. Huang Huang's notice is posted at the entrance of each gambling house, saying something like "Those without identity cards are not allowed to enter" and "Those with improper behavior are strictly prohibited from entering the venue." Armed personnel are stationed at the door to protect the safety of the gambling house, which is really puzzling.</p>
<p>We ask the authorities to think again: Is it a smart move to spend a lot of money to maintain local治安while simultaneously protecting the existence of these "dens of sin," which in effect commits the suspicion of trapping the people in crime? In Shanghai, which is known as the largest city in China and is connected to international views, and at a time when various countries are returning concessions and abandoning extraterritorial rights, seeing such a contradictory phenomenon is unacceptable in any case.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied and cannot be denied that the existence of the Nanshi gambling houses has its complex reasons, which have gradually developed. The biggest of these is of course the economic reason; but we do not believe that gambling donations will be included in the local budget, let alone the central budget, then the so-called economic reason is still an unspeakable thing!</p>
<p>Therefore, if you do not talk about refreshing politics, then you are already talking about it; if you do not seek to win the hearts of the people, then you are already talking about it. Otherwise, after cracking down on speculation in Shanghai, the next thing to do is to ban the Nanshi gambling houses. "It is better for one family to cry than for everyone to cry." We pray that the authorities will understand this purpose and quickly implement this virtuous policy that all people look forward to!</p>

<p>If the company or store in this city, regardless of whether its business nature is (wholesale or retail), wants to adjust the price due to cost reasons, it must submit a table to the trade association in advance with its store name, address, type of goods, purchase price, and selling price, and state the reasons. After being approved by the evaluation committee of the guild and approved by the Materials Control Office of the Public Works Bureau, the selling price can be changed. If the selling price is increased without the above procedures, it will be dealt with upon discovery.</p>

The section recently explained to the shop owners again that they must strictly comply in the future, otherwise they will be severely punished if discovered.</p>

<p>The 4,520 bags of white rice or red rice for the 12th issue of food rations for the first and second districts of the Huxi District are expected to be available for sale this weekend. The household rice for the 11th issue was all red rice, and because the price of rice on the black market has fallen, most citizens have been slow to go to purchase it.</p>
<p>There is no change in the selling price of the 12th issue of food rationing in the urban area. Each person, regardless of age, is entitled to two liters of rice, all of which is Du rice. Only in the Nanshi District is Du rice combined with Xian rice.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Science of Victory　(4) <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The reason why the Japanese army and navy achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War was not only due to the bravery and loyalty of the soldiers but also to the excellent scientific weapons supplied to the battlefield, such as airplanes, tanks, guns, various, as well as food, medicine, construction materials, and so on. On the army side, the Second Army Technical Achievement Medal was awarded to the inventors of such victorious weapons. Here are the award winners and the main inventors: (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 17)</p>
<p>Invention of New Mosquito Coil</p>
<p>…Army Captain Tiáncūn…</p>
<p>Captain Tiáncūn Xiǎng, Chief of the Procurement Section of the Osaka Branch of the Army Quartermaster Factory, is a well-known authority on maritime affairs. The captain is the owner of Tiáncūn Trading Company, a trading company in Kōbe, the president of Japan Rice Milling and Flour Milling Company, and also holds the official position of Deputy Head of the Hyōgo Prefecture Youth Corps, which is somewhat strange for an active-duty soldier. Called to serve at the Osaka Quartermaster Factory, his task was to improve pyrethrum products and investigate their prices.</p>
<p>He began studying products at Shiseido Chemical Industry in Minoshima Town, Wakayama City, and the Imperial Pyrethrum Company. He found the past spiral mosquito coils troublesome because they had to be bent one by one by hand to form a circle, so he wondered how they could be produced by machine. In order to accomplish the task he had in mind, he began working hard with his employees to research this new work. Later, he discovered that a rectangular shape for the mosquito coil had a wider burning area than a circular shape and was more convenient for extrusion machine production. In addition, mosquito coils are only lit when there are many mosquitoes, so at first, they should produce more smoke, and finally, it is enough to keep mosquitoes from biting. This was his own experience, so he made the front end of the mosquito coil thicker and the tail end thinner, which also had the effect of saving costs. At the same time, he made the mosquito coil like a two-headed snake, with the front end divided into two heads, hoping to achieve the effect of producing smoke at first.</p>
<p>In addition, the form of the mosquito coil like the past clamping type, often extinguished halfway, so he put a small hole in the end of the mosquito coil, put in a thin piece of foil, so that it will burn well, and at the same time based on his own experience and attention to mechanization, he invented a machine for mass production of mosquito coils. Due to this production relationship, labor can be reduced by 25%, volume can be reduced by 25%, and the circular shape of the mosquito coil is changed to a rectangular shape, and its transportation force is increased by more than 20%. The southern army, which was well-served by mosquito groups, welcomed the new type of mosquito coil invented by Captain Tiáncūn.</p>
<p>Research on the Progressive Operation Method of Aircraft Production</p>
<p>…Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagoya Aircraft Manufacturing Plant Engineer Sasaki Wataru (37 years old) plus collaborators…</p>
<p>Sasaki, who won the championship, was selected from the typical team of Japanese technicians in the past, which means that he is not only a technical trainer, but he loves technology and takes technology as his second life. Undertaking this research, he was so absorbed in his work that he forgot to eat, shared the difficulties with his subordinates, and worked desperately. Last summer, he finally fell ill and is now hospitalized for recuperation, but he stubbornly said to his colleagues, "I can't work with this kind of illness, it's really unreasonable," so he continued to bury himself in research while still in his sickbed. In the past, production technology in Japan was managed by foremen, so the productivity of each person could not be improved, which was several times lower than that of Germany. This kind of state would continue for a long time. In order to improve the productivity of each person, it is necessary to improve technology and job management. In order to realize this point, government and civilian technicians will spend the greatest effort. Especially in aircraft production, the construction of the airframe occupies an important factor, so after improving its job management, it actually received the effect of expanding production.</p>
<p>Sasaki has been engaged in this research since 1932. First, he made employees understand true technology and trained them to become cadres and employees serving the empire. Then, he continued for a year to conduct basic investigations for research. Finally, in September 1941, he completed the "Progressive Operation Method of Aircraft Production." According to this production method, the productivity has increased by 0%, which really adds a lot of glory to the Japanese army's aircraft production. This research is also expected to be properly adopted in all production ranges. Due to the adoption of this method, aircraft factories across the country are developing rapidly, which is a great contribution to the army aircraft that expands production and defeats the Anglo-Saxon nation. The authorities are further improving the technical management in the engine and other departments according to this research in order to strengthen production.</p>

<p>Under the heavy pressure of soaring prices and rising living expenses, the general consumer, in addition to appealing to the government to intervene to lower prices and reduce living expenses, can only make up his mind and unite to resist those who hoard and speculate.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been so-called consumer alliances in various countries, which are used to resist the exploitation and exorbitant profits of producers, such as the British Anti-Corn Law League from 1839, the American Anti-Meat Trust League before the First World War, the German Anti-Beer Trust League, and the French Anti-Gas Trust League. In addition, the establishment of temperance societies, anti-smoking societies, abstinence societies, vegetarian societies, simple clothing societies, anti-killing societies, and consumer social alliances by socially conscious people around the world is not only aimed at safeguarding the self-interests of consumers, but also at maintaining the morals of the world.</p>
<p>Recently, the rise of the consumer cooperative movement in Shanghai has a momentum of wind and clouds. In addition, consumers have risen up to resist hoarding tigers, which is a kind of automatic behavior, and we deeply sympathize with it.</p>
<p>However, we feel that in this chaotic world, large and small hoarding tigers are as numerous as carps crossing the river. The best way for us general consumers to deal with them is probably to save on consumption. No matter how the hoarding price stimulates people's hearts and raises it every day, we must not panic because of this and rush to buy it. Let the top-grade leather shoes rise to one thousand and several hundred yuan a pair, the top-grade bicycles, eight thousand yuan a piece, the top-grade carpets, twelve thousand yuan a piece; let them get dizzy and rise! Let the general hoarding tigers make a fortune of national crisis on empty paper! When peace comes in the near future and prices plummet, what will be the result of the hoarding tigers who now think they are invincible?</p>

<p>In order to revitalize the countryside and enhance production, the Ministry of Finance has assigned the Transportation Bank to handle the revitalization of rural loans. The bank has sent personnel to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan in Jiangsu Province, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Xiashi in Zhejiang Province, and Wuhu, Bengbu in Anhui Province along the two railway lines to investigate the rural situation and planting conditions as a guideline for rural loans. The investigation work has now been completed, and a complete plan for rural loans is being drafted, which will be submitted to the Ministry for approval and then implemented step by step.</p>
<p>Four Rules for Loans</p>
<p>The organization will also send investigators to investigate the rural economic situation in (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui), and then each bank and village will determine the loan amount. The methods are stipulated as follows: (1) The target of rural mortgage loans is rural mortgages; (2) The target of rural warehouse mortgage loans is agricultural warehouses; (3) The target of loans for cattle and agricultural tools is limited to farmers who have joined rural cooperatives; (4) The target of loans for green seedlings is limited to farmers of agricultural cooperatives.</p>
<p>Lowering Rural Loan Interest Rates</p>
<p>The banks will also intend to follow the laws and regulations of the authorities, using one-fifth of the total deposits as agricultural loan funds. In order to assist this undertaking, the authorities will do their best to lower the interest rate on rural loan funds to help revitalize rural production.</p>
<p>Loan Amount Reaches Tens of Millions of Yuan</p>
<p>It is also learned that the total amount of deposits of member banks in this city's banking industry is 190 million yuan, and the total amount of deposits of member money shops in the Money Exchange Industry Association is 60 million to 65 million yuan. If calculated by one-fifth of the banking industry's 190 million yuan deposit, the total amount of loan funds can reach tens of millions of yuan. Therefore, the recent 500,000 yuan loan established by various banks and China Silk Industry Co., Ltd. is entirely for the purpose of helping the company purchase spring cocoons and develop the silk industry.</p>

<p>In order to implement the wartime economic policy and strengthen the control mechanism of the grain industry, the Ministry of Food has supervised the reorganization of the six industry associations (miscellaneous grains, flour, animal husbandry, edible oil, sugar, eggs). Those in the Shanghai area have been organized and established before April 30 as scheduled. Regarding the joint association of these six industries, the Ministry of Food originally scheduled to complete the organization uniformly on the 5th of this month. Among them, in addition to the National Flour Industry Joint Association, which was established on the 2nd of this month, there are also five industry joint associations (miscellaneous grains, flour, animal husbandry, edible oil, and eggs), which are also actively preparing to complete the organization within the deadline. However, the Ministry of Food authorities believe that the industry associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have not yet been organized and established, so they ordered that after the industry associations in various places are completely established, the founding meeting of the joint association will be convened so that the industry associations in various places can send responsible representatives to participate in the meeting and expect the organization of the joint association to be sound. It is heard that the industry associations in various places can be fully established in three to five days at the latest, and the five-industry joint association can be established separately around the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>In order to implement the wartime economic policy outline and adjust economic opportunities, the National Government authorities promulgated the Industry and Commerce Association Implementation Regulations, ordering the competent authorities to supervise and adjust the original major commodity, industry and commerce associations in accordance with the regulations, and reorganize or organize them to adapt to the new system of the wartime economic institutions. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has designated (1) the cotton industry, (2) the yarn number industry, (3) the cotton weaving factory industry, (4) the cloth industry, (5) the grain number industry, (6) the coal ball industry, (7) the New Asia industry, (8) the industrial grease industry, (9) the match soap candle industry, and (10) the tobacco industry. The initiators of the industry associations have first set a deadline for organization. The established industry associations have already handled the re-registration and membership procedures for new and old members. Because the Economic Bureau stipulates that companies and firms that have not joined the industry associations as members will be suspended from business from May 1, the companies and firms in each industry have gone to the respective industry associations to handle membership registration procedures to protect their business rights and interests. The above ten industry associations have now been reorganized and established, and they intend to start handling the membership organization of the sixteen industry association federations designated by the Ministry of Industry. According to reports from the Ministry of Industry, the industry associations under the sixteen industry association federations designated by the Ministry of Industry will be reorganized into a new system of wartime economic institutions. Therefore, after the reorganization and establishment of the ten industry associations handled by the Economic Bureau, the other industry associations belonging to the federation will be supervised by the Economic Bureau to reorganize and establish them within this (May) month in order to participate in the material control, raw material purchase, allocation, sales, manufacturing, and all other rights in the lower-level institutions under the Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Translated Commentary　Expectations for Rural Finance <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Discussions on increasing wartime agricultural production are frequently mentioned, but there are still many problems in the stage of investigation and research, and they have not been realized as concrete countermeasures. However, only in the financial aspect, there are organizations such as the Rural Financial Group and the agricultural overdraft of the Central Reserve Bank, which are all measures to enhance agricultural production and are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Looking at the current financial situation in rural areas, we can only rely on pawn shops and cooperative societies to mobilize a little capital. At the same time, there are also some personal loans from business owners and loans of existing goods from merchants, but the numbers are small and the interest rates are too high, so this kind of loan does not have the characteristics of increasing production capital, but only loans for farmers to overcome temporary difficulties. The biggest issue in Chinese agriculture today is how to get the capital for increasing production to reach the countryside, how to enrich irrigation equipment and plowing cattle, and how to purchase fertilizer. But fortunately, the assistance of the Ministry of Finance authorities has approached the direction of resolution, which is a happy thing.</p>
<p>Although it is not clear in what form the current Rural Financial Group provides loans, in short, it follows these few realities: first, extremely low interest rates; second, long loan periods; third, the loan targets are not wealthy rural households, but ordinary people. In the past, the local loans of the Central Reserve Bank and other banks seemed to charge too high interest rates, so those who could use their loans were not farmers and real producers, but only those businesses that used these loans to lend at high interest rates. The interest rate on the capital that farmers can use for production should be at most about 1% per annum. At the same time, the loan period should be at least ten years or more. If it is capital used to build irrigation tools or plowing cattle, it should be repaid in three to five years on a regular basis.</p>
<p>What we most hope from the authorities is that rural loans must not cultivate high-interest loans in rural areas. If the loans are only targeted at so-called wealthy people, or if emphasis is placed on collateral, then the capital will inevitably flow into the hands of the wealthy, and the result will be to promote the wealthy's high-interest exploitation of borrowing and lending. Although it is difficult to lend to poor people who have no collateral, it is not impossible. We should think of ways to use cooperatives and even the actual loans of plowing cattle and other categories to help rural areas.</p>
<p>In any case, it is always a welcome phenomenon that the financial community can focus on rural loans. The National Government authorities should further promote this trend, and at the same time, force various banks to stipulate that a certain percentage of their total loans should be rural loans. This may not be a good method. We urgently hope that we will actively strive to focus on rural finance. (Yún Péng: Translated from the Continental New Daily, May 3)</p>

<h3 id="e71">Counterfeit <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Zhōu Sù</p>
<p>I heard that there are counterfeit "× Flower Brand" cosmetics. Why would anyone want to buy counterfeits? However, people do want to buy them, and the sales are not bad! Because: the counterfeits are "almost indistinguishable from the real thing," and they are simply indistinguishable from the real thing. -- This really surprises the ignorant.</p>
<p>However, in any case, it can also be seen here the "greatness" of the Chinese people's imitation ability. It is just a pity that this "great" imitation ability is not used in other useful undertakings, but is simply drilling into some unimportant dead ends. This is not only not admirable, but also feels quite sad and shameful.</p>
<p>However, this guilt cannot be entirely attributed to the manufacturers of counterfeit cosmetics: if these "lovers of decoration" were not so fond of imported goods, if they had the psychology and action of loving domestic goods, the rampant counterfeiting would certainly not be so great.</p>
<p>If we just imitate others and follow behind them, we will always only be "subordinate to others," and there will be no day to "compete with them," let alone think of running ahead of others and becoming their leader.</p>
<p>Not only is imitating cosmetics like this, but in art, science, industry, and commerce, if we just imitate, if we just "imitate brands," if we just pick up the scraps of others' ideas, if we don't want to create at all, if we don't have any independent spirit, we will just have to follow behind others forever and be a laggard.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Random Talks on Suicide <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Diao Ge</p>
<p>If you hear of a suicide case where the truth is unclear, you will definitely guess the reason for the suicide: if the person was a big businessman, you would guess that he failed in speculation; if he was a young person, you would assume he was disappointed in love; if she was a 19th-century woman, you would assume she couldn't bear the abuse from her in-laws; however, these are just the general superficial reasons that we generally know.</p>
<p>Suicide is very common in today's world. In the United States, an average of one person commits suicide every half hour. Even in our Shanghai, according to newspaper statistics, it is also very common.</p>
<p>The statistics in European and American countries are indeed very interesting: most suicide victims are unemployed, relatively educated, and middle-aged people around 39 years old. The age of suicide ranges from as low as fourteen or fifteen years old to as high as seventy years old. Regarding the gender of suicide victims, men are more than three times more likely to commit suicide than women. The season for suicide is generally most common in summer and least common in winter.</p>
<p>Regarding the tools of suicide, women are generally gentle and men are straightforward: of course, they are also progressing. In the past, most women committed suicide by hanging themselves, but now they use sleeping pills, lysol, and opium instead. Even recently, they have used other chemical substances to commit suicide. The suicide methods for men are mostly jumping from buildings, jumping into the sea, and using guns. There is also another statistic: when the coffin of a person who committed suicide by eating opium is reopened, the body has been moved in four or five out of ten cases.</p>
<p>According to psychological explanations, the main cause of suicide is the extremely complex subconsciousness lurking deep in the mind. The occurrence of this effect starts as early as childhood: when a child wants something and does not get it, he will develop a hatred psychology! If he encounters this situation without stopping, it will keep increasing, and eventually, the hatred will turn into a murderous abnormality. This psychology lurks, and if it encounters external stimulation, coupled with the loss of self-control, thoughts of murder will occur. If the murder fails, he will commit suicide. Therefore, many experts have said, "One will not commit suicide without harboring the intention to kill."</p>
<p>The method of preventing suicide: that is, in childhood, eliminate as much as possible all factors that can cause mental anxiety. For adults, there are methods to increase self-cultivation and supplement it with mental comfort.</p>
<h3 id="e73">"Ideals" <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Jun</p>
<p>Views and opinions on ideals seem to vary. Some people regard ideals as an impossible thought, like a sentence we often hear: "Hey, you are too idealistic about this matter:" contained in this tone, there are clearly two different emotions, one is well-intentioned persuasion, and the other is malicious mockery: of course, this needs to be determined from the speaker's attitude and emotion.</p>
<p>Treating ideals as "fantasy" or "imagination" - it is the value of a transcendent, progressive idea that can be put into practice is dismissed without consideration. I believe that anyone who holds this view is a fool's thought: otherwise, this person is either an idiot, or his brain has already lost the ability to think.</p>
<p>Therefore, when correctly and reasonably explaining the two words of ideal, I feel that an ideal should be something that exists based on the real world, and through someone's thinking, dissolved in the accumulation of this person's life experience, and then created an ideal through the judgment of his thinking organization. Then, this ideal is based on all the unsatisfactory phenomena in the real world, or a facility that should be thoroughly reformed, and becomes a planned and created sublime "plan."</p>
<p>In this way, an ideal is not only not a fantasy or imagination, but an engine that organically promotes society, even the world, and the progress of all mankind. In this way, if there is no transcendent, progressive, perfect ideal that improves the unsatisfactory aspects of this world, then this world will only decay day by day, and eventually head towards the path of destruction, and the people in this world will not have a trace of vitality.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should welcome the correct existence of ideals in everyone's thought system. And the fact that most people today have a positive and brave spirit towards the world, walking towards the light, we cannot but attribute this to the greatness of ideals. Otherwise, the number of world-weary people in the world would probably increase many times over?</p>
<p>In short, we should have planned ideals, cultivate the development and growth of these ideals, so that there will be a bright future for the whole world and all mankind. However, ideals are a matter of principle, and the most important thing is the word "do," otherwise, empty ideals are still difficult to put into practice.</p>

<p>— Meng Niu</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I've been getting more and more depressed lately! My friends go out laughing and want me to go too, but I plead, "You guys go!"</p>
<p>Despondency, selfishness, indifference, anxiety, lethargy... Ah! These many strange nouns used to just flash by my ears, but now they are all added to me. They are like countless steel needles, flying towards my heart one by one, and I feel terrified and don't know how to deal with them.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, I just face the window, look at the sky, watch the flowing clouds, soaring birds, the terrifyingly blue sky, and the thin treetops in the distance... My friends say I've "changed," they all say I've "changed." "Change" is another strange name.</p>
<p>They advised me to go for a walk outside, and I agreed and followed them. I walked with my head down, counting every stone, staring at every blade of grass, every grain of sand, and every speck of dust on the road. They seemed to be talking excitedly and laughing. I looked up at them, and they laughed even harder, and I seemed to be laughing too, but I didn't know what they were talking about.</p>
<p>One day, an old professor said to me like this: "Negativity is a youth disease, a poisonous disease that buries youth. You are young now and most vulnerable to this poisonous demon's attack. You are dissatisfied with reality, and the surrounding environment is oppressing you. You must resist with all your might. But, unfortunately, you have been subdued by this poisonous demon. In its giant palm, you are like a defeated rooster, crouching in a corner, powerless. However, your heart is still burning, the embers have not yet been extinguished, and in the future, it will still be able to spew out a raging fire of ten thousand feet. So I hope you work hard to protect and nurture the embers that are about to die out, because this is your priceless treasure - at the same time, you must cheer up and focus on your work, you should go to the practical side, and not go on the path of fantasy. Remember: 'Youth is the spring of life.'"</p>
<p>I nodded silently.</p>

<p>Only a sharp "thorn" can "stimulate" his inner strength. "Suffering is the seed of "happiness," and this seed will not sprout and grow luxuriantly unless it struggles through the harsh cold of winter and kills all the underground pests.</p>
<p>"Stimulation" is a seasoning in life. Without it, people will live a mediocre life. The more stimulation, the wider the experience. The so-called "experience" is the accumulation of facing stimulation every time.</p>
<p>We are all victors of opposition. When stimulation comes, we must calmly respond. If there is no resistance, we will have no way to consolidate our will, like a big tree, after thousands of storms, it will not only not be broken, but also become more and more consolidated.</p>
<p>Sarcasm, ridicule, humiliation, contempt... are the best kinds of stimulation. As long as we have courage, even though these are like sand, we must learn from the spirit of clams, and we will forge pearls.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Talking About "Wealth" <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Da</p>
<p>"People die for wealth" has become a common saying among later generations. In fact, this is only a seemingly correct statement. The meaning contained in this sentence is too general, neither pointing out what kind of person, nor saying what kind of wealth. It is not appropriate to include all people and wealth in the world with just the four words "people die for wealth."</p>
<p>"People die for wealth," indeed many people have entered its cage. For the sake of wealth, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their own lives, sell out the affection of their fellow beings, do evil, harm others and harm themselves. However, although its power is great, it still cannot encompass all the people in the world. Looking back at the history of China and foreign countries, the deaths of many great heroes and patriots did not die here. Wealth can certainly make people die, but which of "faith, righteousness, propriety, shame, morality, fidelity, filial piety, and ambition" is not worth making people regard death as home?</p>
<h3 id="e77">Appearance and Interior <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>Henry David Thoreau said: "If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away." We believe that the purity and flawlessness of the interior creates the shining light of the exterior; however, most people pursue the exterior and never pay attention to the interior.</p>
<p>We see in today's society that many people are pursuing the exterior and neglecting the enrichment of the interior. Therefore, on the surface, it looks like a person, but you don't know that it's a "fancy pillow and rotten straw"! They only look at the exterior.</p>
<p>Therefore, a person with real knowledge and talent must start his cultivation from the interior: first pursue the enrichment and cultivation of the interior, so that the interior creates a pure and flawless soul, and then the exterior will naturally shine brightly.</p>

<p>Those who put their dreams into practice are the successful people in their careers.</p>
<p>Those who want to be quick will certainly not achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Hesitation cannot turn facts into reality.</p>

<h3 id="e79">"Philosophy" · "Life" <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>To truly understand the value and meaning of something, one cannot rely solely on the monotonous changes of facts and their appearance, but must study the causes and effects of facts and the truth hidden within them. This is what "philosophy" includes. If life is separated from philosophy, it is a meaningless life, and similarly, if philosophy is separated from life, it is also of no value.</p>
<p>Philosophy is not a mysterious thing, it is just a specialized discipline that studies people's daily lives. Philosophy can portray the right and wrong of real life, and find a way for you to live your life, so that "life" is not wasted.</p>
<p>To study philosophy, one must have the spirit of "breaking the casserole and asking to the end." Only with this spirit can one discover "life." For example, if you catch a robber, ordinary people will immediately send him to the authorities for prosecution, but those who study philosophy are different. They want to study why he became a robber? Why doesn't society have other jobs for him to do? Why can his inner vices overcome his virtues? … By asking these questions, he can further understand life, understand society, and become the insight of his philosophy. Therefore, philosophy is a kind of evolution from small things to big things, from the internal meaning. It is derived from the integration of real-world foundations, so-called political philosophy, social philosophy, life philosophy... are all derived from asking questions and clarifying them from life problems.</p>
<p>The great Greek philosopher Socrates once said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Therefore, if you want to make life meaningful and live a rational life, you must evaluate your own life, study the relationship between society and ourselves, and have a "doubtful" spirit to explore the causes and effects of facts, so that "life" can embark on a reasonable track.</p>
<p>Have you ever examined your life? I think it is necessary for every "living person" to understand the value and meaning of their own life in this world!</p>

<h3 id="e80">Establishing a Joint Guarantee Newspaper Reading Room <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Suichu</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in our country, and a gathering place for culture. Although the popularization of newspaper reading is a small matter, it is actually very important. Newspapers contain detailed news, such as international current events, improvements in agriculture, industry, commerce, and learning, as well as common sense that everyone should have. However, there are many people in Shanghai who do not read newspapers, especially the general coolies and farmers who cannot afford to buy newspapers. They know nothing about world affairs, which leads to low intelligence and the agricultural and industrial products they produce are not improved, which affects the welfare of the people. It is not a superficial matter. To trace the cause, not paying attention to reading newspapers is one of the reasons. Therefore, it is advocated to use the Baojia organization, and the joint Bao chiefs should jointly initiate it. Each Lianbao should set up a newspaper rack and prepare various newspapers for public reading. The promotion should start from the urban area and extend to the countryside, so that ordinary people who cannot afford to buy newspapers can also see the news on the newspapers and increase their knowledge. This matter is easy to do, and I hope the Baojia authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e81">A Small Opinion on Group Weddings <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Jiu Hong</p>
<p>In recent years, there are many places in Shanghai that host group weddings, some are run by the government, some are run by private individuals, and some are run by organizations such as hometown associations, with no fewer than six or seven places. Group weddings are the only simple, economical, and solemn way now, especially when everyone gathers together, it is a rare coincidence. However, as time passes, everyone becomes strangers again. Although there is a group photo, it is still not easy to recognize each other. Such a rare encounter is scattered in an instant, which is a pity. Therefore, I suggest adding a mailing list, detailing the names, ages, native places, occupations, permanent addresses, etc. of each married person, and sending one copy to each person to maintain permanent contact. In the past, there was the friendship of "same year" and "same office," and this can also be called "same marriage" or "same joy." In the future, when celebrating silver wedding anniversaries, everyone can gather together again.</p>
<p>Secret Prescription for Quitting Smoking (1) Four catties of tender cottonwood bark, four taels of Eucommia ulmoides, four taels of Cordyceps sinensis, two taels of Fritillaria cirrhosa, one tael of licorice, one tael of Yunnan earth, grind these six herbs to fine powder and decoct them three times, filter out the residue, concentrate, and sieve. Then add half a catty of red sugar, melt it, sieve it again, and mix it over a low fire until it becomes a paste like opium. Burn the foam and put it in a pipe to replace opium, and smoke it as usual to satisfy the craving. After a long time, you will naturally quit without any pain, and you can work as usual, quitting smoking unconsciously. If you are traveling and it is inconvenient, you can make it into pills according to the prescription and carry them with you, which is even more convenient, but you must eat more for the first time to get drunk, so that you know how much to take each time in the future. (2) Preparation method: First, take two taels of cigarette ash, put it in a copper pot, add water and decoct it, let it boil in the front, do not stir it (the white foam floating on the surface of the pot during decoction is the foam, stirring it will cause the foam to disperse into the water). After decocting, sieve it to clarify it, then put the cigarette ash on the cage back into the pot and decoct it again, sieve it as before, and let it settle, decocting it five or six times in a row. If you think there is too much moisture, you can put the clarified cigarette water into the pot and decoct it slightly. When it is decocted to the size of a vegetable bowl, pour it out and set aside for later use. Take twenty taels of white rice, wash it clean and put it in a pot to stir-fry until it is hot, add one soup spoon of the clarified cigarette water and stir-fry again, adding it as you stir-fry, until all the cigarette water is used up (add only one soup spoon each time to make it easy to dry), grind the rice into a fine powder and put it in a porcelain jar. Dosage: Take one qian of powdered rice (containing one fen of tobacco substance) with brown sugar for each cigarette craving, take it half an hour before the craving, increase or decrease the amount according to your own size, always to the point where you feel comfortable. After taking the powdered rice, do not smoke again, and you must reduce the powdered rice once every day or three or five days, for example, those who take one qian each time should reduce it by one fen or several li, do not be impatient to seek quick results, but you must not stop reducing it, in order to eliminate the stubborn addiction, reduce it to the end, if your body is strong, you can stop taking it.</p>
