<p>社評</p>
<h3>向交通機關呼籲</h3>
<p>目前交通行旅之困難，已成爲老百姓同感的苦惱，這在目前確是嚴重問題之一·交通璧如人身的血液，如果血夜循環發生了障礙，則人身立有百病叢生之患；同樣的，如果交通營業不良，則社會秩序不免即有不安之慮。所以目前交通方面種種問題，必須迅速得適當和妥善的解決，而所望於日本交通機關之努力改善，尤爲迫急。全世界都知道，日本是交通事業最發達的國家，而且是交通管理最好的國家，凡是曾經到過日本的，都留有一種好的印象。單以東京而言，爲六百八十餘萬（昭和十六年推計）人口的世界上最大都市之一，鐵道錯綜，密如蛛網，車輛輻轃，晝夜不息。然而日本的交通當局管理裕如，所以一入東京，秩序井然，毫無絲毫擁擠的現象。日本交通當局不僅在平時管理得法，特別是在戰時，表現了驚人的高度科學化的技術。例如近年在南太平洋作戰中，無論水陸運輸，都能在戰火之中，維持暢通與安全；而且在佔領地區，一交通都能迅速地恢復，這種高度的科學技術，那能不令人敬佩。</p>
<p>現在上海與南京杭州間的交通，早由日本交通機關所管理，我們熱誠希望主管當局運用其高度的科學技術，更希望運用在日本施行早已成功的最合理的管理方法，使中國的老百姚得到一些便利。目前老百姓所迫急期待的，不外下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一交通的要義，首在便利，若是在購票，乘車，搭船等等方面實施過於繁複的手續，以致使一般旅客和工商界爲了這種手續，每次動需延滯到一二日之久，就不免失去便利第一」的交通要旨了。所以希望今後在手續方面儘可能的要做到簡便，或則雖有緊複的手續，而以最科學化最合理的辦法執行之，嚴厲防止執行人員的留難等情。</p>
<p>第二，今後爲了便利交通，發展運輸，以增進物資的流通，人事的便捷，一切交通機構，一方面要努力於交通工具的增加，另一方面更須在管理方面加以改善。例如火車，輪船，公共長途汽車等站所，應多闢進口與出口，以减少擁擠，節省時間，對於旅客固然便利不少，即交通機關本身實在也同樣會感到便利的。其次，是多設代理售票處，同樣可以减少一時擁擠混亂的現象。還有各站各級工作人員以及伕役等，必須加以訓練，要有服務道德，更要有對於旅客的禮貌，要知道交通事業是商業性的，旅客都是主顧，化了錢乘船坐車，怎能對之有非禮的舉動，吾則殊失　通機關爲便利民間旅行的意義了。</p>
<p>最後，我們承認要希望交通便利，還有賴於憲警的協同進行。例如檢查的辦法，似乎有待於更大的改善，總以節省時間，便利旅客爲要旨。至於檢查人員技術上和服務道德上的訓練，同樣是增進交通效率和减少旅客困難的必要條件。</p>
<p>我們深信交通機關與憲警當局對於這些問題，已有相當的注意。現在和平區內，並沒有特殊情形，足以構成交通不便的條件，一切使人民徒受痛苦的現象，是不能再任其存在了。因爲一般人民的痛苦的反面，必然給少數不法之徒，以爲非作惡的機會。只有交通做到了眞正能便利一般人民而不是便利少數人的程度，那麼，必然更能提高運輸的效率，必然更能加强物資與人力的調劑，增進工農生產和鞏固社會的安寧。</p>

<h3>承繼東方寶貴的遺產</h3>
<p>— 孫行讓</p>
<p>東方寳貴的遺產，實在太多了，這兒只說一本有關兵學方面書——即頗有國際聲譽的孫子兵法。我想在這烽火遍地，全球動盪的大時代中，正是各國以戰爭決生死存亡關頭之時，它自有新的存在的意議罷。</p>
<p>書的考證</p>
<p>孫子兵法乃春秋戰國時齊人孫武所撰，史記孫子列傳載孫武之書十三篇，而漢書藝文志乃載孫子兵法八十二篇，圖九卷。故張守節正義以十三篇爲上卷，又有中下二卷，杜牧亦謂武書本數十萬言，皆曹操削其繁剩，筆其精粹，以成此醫。然史記在漢志前，常以爲據，其餘或未足信；葉適以其人不見於左氏春秋，疑其書乃春秋末戰國初山林處士之所爲，然史記載關閭謂武曰子之十三篇吾盡觀之矣，則可證明確爲孫武所撰而毫無疑問的了。——說見公羊壽著中國兵家書籍輯要。</p>
<p>關於該書的批註</p>
<p>註孫子兵法的人很多，或主兵法，或主理論，各有所長。始注此書者爲曹操，嗣後魏王凌張子尙賈翊吳沈友都有箋註，可惜現在都亡佚了，至宋吉天保乃有十家會註，十家者：（一）魏武帝（即曹操）（一）梁孟氏（三）唐李荃（四）杜牧（五）陳皞（六）賈林（七）宋梅聖兪（八）王晳（九）何延錫（十）張預。此外還有孫鎬紀燮諸承，不遑細舉。至於　世註是書者，則以海寗蔣方震著之孫子新釋（民國二年）與常熟公羊壽著之孫子兵法哲理硏究較著名。蔣氏曾遊學日本德國，爲我國有數之兵學專家，氏註此書均將其原理與克勞塞維茲著之大戰學理與伯盧麥著之戰略論毛奇之普法戰史相互參證，果頗多創見，後者徧重於哲理方面之硏究，絕無戰史之引證，但亦頗精要。</p>
<p>價值的再估</p>
<p>兵器無論如何進步，戰法一無論怎樣新頴，然而戰爭之基本原則，則仍不因時間空間而有所變更。略舉一二個例，已可概見孫子學說之精深博大了，如計篇曰：兵者，國之大事，蔣氏釋兵之一字即戰爭之謂。現在無論那一國均不肯輕易掀起戰爭者，卽因戰爭乃一個國家之大事，存亡絕續之所關，而不得不加以鄭重考慮而後才敢决定。又如謀攻篇曰：是故百戰百勝，非善之善者也，不戰而能屈人之兵，乃善之善者也，故用兵之道，全國爲上，破國次之，全軍爲上，破軍次之，蓋戰爭一啓，消耗國力必大，是以近世各國爲遂行國家之某種目的，均希望能以政略上之成功，以代兵戎之相見，即此之意。又假定戰爭已經開始，或將敵城團團圍住後，其先九下勸降書，以冀不攻而下之，此種保存實力之方法，要亦不外乎此項原則之活用耳。我想在這次東西南北的大戰中，各種原則之活用與遵行，眞不乏其例，是可確信的。</p>
<p>結語</p>
<p>孫中山先生曾說，孫子兵法乃我國軍事哲理之書；誠不可不一讀，此書非但爲我國治兵者之要籍，目爲外國人常常在精究和應用着，日本對於此書早有譯本，　爲軍事官佐之，必讀物，在德國據說亦有是書之譯本，（蔣氏曾親見之）這決不是信口胡道。史載日本在大戰時代，勇將武田信玄曾把「其疾如風，其徐如林，侵掠如火，不動如山」之警句，作爲格言，而記於旌旗上，以爲實施機動戰之準則，可見此書之價値。這次世界大戰結束後，當另有新註的孫子兵法出版，那是毫無疑問的，誠如歐陽修所謂：兵以不窮爲奇。</p>
<p>猶憶當時蔣方震先生遊學柏林時，會謁普法大戰時之普軍大本營作戰課長伯　麥，當共吿辭而出時，將軍曾以手撫其肩曰：「好爲之矣，願子之誠有所貫澈也，抑吾聞之拿破侖有言，百年後東方將有兵略家出，以繼承古昔敎訓之原則，爲歐人之大敵也。子好爲之矣」。噫！今蔣氏已遽歸道山。今後東方兵略家，究將屬之誰耶？我眞不能妄加猜測了。</p>
<h3>香雪園探梅記</h3>
<p>— 警頑</p>
<p>這幾大來的花市上，水仙，天竹，蠟梅聯袂登塲，偶然在南京路新雅酒樓的橱窗裏，被我發兒幾盆雅緻的盆梅，姿態蒼老，看花不繁，盆上還題着風雅的名稱，如「梅花高士」「放鶴亭」「羅浮飛來」等，原來是周瘦鵑氏所主辦的香雪園」的出品，當然是與眾不同了。可是這幾盆不能滿足我的眼欲，得了盆旁園址牌上的指示，把我引到了卡德路二十七號的園中去。</p>
<p>找到了園址，踏上了幾級石　，就見竹架上的小品，玲瓏可愛：忽然在走廊裏瞥見了一株龐大的古梅，種在大長方古盆裏，樹皮斑駁古老，好似一塊「縐瘦透漏」的假山石，頂上抽枝，縱横交錯，勢若游龍，枝上着花繁多，正在含苞待放。壁上張着一幅名畫家錢瘦鐵氏的傑作，替　盆古梅寫照，兩旁配着陳定山氏法書的楹聯，聯語「開窗晴日花鬚暖」「義士千秋俠骨香，也與古梅貼切，原　就是兩年來引得許多詩人畫家們大加賞識的義士梅。據說它來自蘇州虎邱五義士墓畔，那是明朝的遺物，已有三四百年之久，怪不得分外的老氣横秋了。</p>
<p>在走廊的裏面，是一片園地，園中陳列着不少小型的盆梅，都是富有書意詩情的，紅梅，綠　·懸崖梅，嚴寒　友等？色色俱全，配上了精巧的人物和亭宇，相得益彰，還題着「孤山處士家」「待鶴來」「梅嶼放棹」「梅花書屋」「疎影横斜」「庾嶺一枝」等名，更覺雅趣盎然，和市上那些大同小異的盆梅，自是不可同日而語。（酬助濟貧金）</p>
<h3>讀「二十四孝圖」（四）</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>——給我的女兒</p>
<p>而且，有些縱是眞的也太浪費，如此老萊子七十幾歲還在着五色衣作嬰兒啼，倒不如趁早作點別的事，於人於已於父母都較無遺憾，也未嘗不可以說是孝。其次我以為創造孝子故事的人，似乎自己就不很孝。他們對於自己的父母印象欠佳，以致對於天下古今的父母的印象欠佳。他們的故事中間的父母往往是殘忍苛酷，脾氣古怪有「虐子犯」（恕我杜撰）的一些特殊的人類，和通常的情形，相差很遠的。塞門諾甫的「飢餓」裏的父親捨不得把東西給兒女吃，那是一種特殊惰形，大動亂中，食物太難到手，不免顯出人性的自私的一面來。屠格涅甫的『父與子』寫父代與子代的新舊思想的衝突，避免了父子之間的直接的塲面，其實直接塲面恐怕還要殘酷，父母千涉兒女的思想或婚姻之類的事，倒是很多的。但這只限於父母特別落後，兒女特別進步的塲合，而父母對於兒女的苛虐的心，也不一定有。紅樓夢買政待寳玉很嚴厲，我也寫過我的母親常常打我，這都是因爲敎，並自誤以打爲敎的緣故，不能說是虐待，剛剛相反，倒是因爲愛俗語說，「只有瓜戀子沒有子戀瓜」，父母大抵都是愛兒女的，恐怕比兒女之愛父母　要眞切。可是二十四孝的父母，却往往大不相同。舜的父母拚命要把他弄死雖然是後母，不免有偏心，何至一定要殺他？况且父親總是自己的呀。黄香的父母眼睜睜地望着兒子　蚊蟲，自已一點不動聲色。老萊子的父母明知兒子七十幾歲了，還要讓他挑水，已經很奇怪：王祥孟宗的母親以堂堂的大人，偏在冬天里問小孩子要鯉魚要筍子。</p>

<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>然後他們開始爭論下去，拉爾斯頓變得愈冷靜愈刻薄，吉普助則愈熱烈，愈激昂，最後，拉爾斯頓冷酷地說·『旣然你逼得我說老實話，吉賓先生，那你就聽好。某些時以前，你在這裏並沒有什麽作爲。你的敎授法是遲鈍的，老式的；你個人的習慣是爛汚的；你不理我的訓示，這種不理，如果出之於一個較爲年輕的人，我就要當作完全的不服從了。我不要這樣，吉賓先生，你必須明白我的忍耐，並且我已忍耐了這麽長久。」</p>
<p>「可是—」吉普斯開始說，完全惶惑的神情；然後，他從那種非常斥責的話語中，零落地找住了幾個字。</p>
<p>『爛汚—呃哼—你說—？』</p>
<p>『是的，看看你看的長袍吧。我已經知道，你這件長袍是全校時常藉以尋開心的主題。』</p>
<p>吉普斯也知道這一點，但是在個看來，這似乎從來就不是很可抱憾的事情。</p>
<p>他說下去。「並且—你也說—呃哼—說到什麽—不服從—？』</p>
<p>『不是，我沒有說。我只說，如果一個較爲年靑的人這樣，我就當他不服從了。在你，這大概是遲鈍和頑固的混合。例如拉丁文的讀音問題——我想我在幾年以前就吿訴你，我要全校都用新方法。其他的敎師都服從了我；而你却寗願黏守住你的老方法，結果只是混亂典無效。』</p>
<p>最後，吉普斯總算有了一些可以懂得而且可以對付的事情。『喔，那樣麽？』他輕蔑地回答說。『唔，我—呃哼—我承認我不贊成新的讀音法。我從未贊成過。呃哼—在我看來簡直是胡鬧。叫學生在學校裏說「吉格祿」（Kiekero）—呃哼—他們一出學校就一直說「西塞祿（Cicero）—他們老早—呃哼——就這樣說，不很好麽。並且不說「維失西姆」（Vicissim）—我的天呀—你却要叫他們說「我們吻他」（Wekissim），呃哼—呃哼—他時刻咯咯地發着聲，忘記了他是在拉爾斯頓的書室裏，不是在他自己熟習的敎室裏。（二十六）</p>

<h3>An Appeal to Transportation Authorities</h3>
<p>The current difficulties in transportation and travel have become a shared suffering for the common people. This is indeed one of the most serious problems at present. Transportation is like the blood of the human body. If blood circulation is obstructed, the body will suffer from a multitude of ailments. Similarly, if transportation services are poor, social order will inevitably be threatened. Therefore, the various problems in transportation must be resolved quickly, appropriately, and properly. The efforts of Japanese transportation authorities to improve the situation are especially urgently needed. The whole world knows that Japan is the most developed country in transportation and the best in transportation management. Anyone who has been to Japan has a good impression. Take Tokyo as an example. It is one of the largest cities in the world with a population of over six million eight hundred thousand (estimated in 1941). The railways are intricate and dense like spider webs, and vehicles travel day and night without ceasing. However, the Japanese transportation authorities manage with ease, so upon entering Tokyo, the order is well-maintained, and there is no crowding at all. The Japanese transportation authorities not only manage well in peacetime, but also demonstrate a surprisingly high degree of scientific technology, especially in wartime. For example, in recent operations in the South Pacific, whether it is water or land transport, they can maintain smooth and safe operations in the midst of war. Moreover, in occupied areas, transportation can be quickly restored. This high degree of scientific technology is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Now, the transportation between Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou is managed by Japanese transportation authorities. We sincerely hope that the responsible authorities will apply their advanced scientific technology and the most reasonable management methods that have already been successful in Japan to provide some convenience to the Chinese people. At present, the most urgent expectations of the common people are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>First, the essence of transportation is convenience. If overly complicated procedures are implemented in purchasing tickets, boarding trains, or taking ships, causing ordinary passengers and businesses to be delayed for one or two days each time, it will inevitably lose the primary objective of "convenience." Therefore, it is hoped that in the future, procedures will be simplified as much as possible. Or, even if there are complex procedures, they should be implemented with the most scientific and reasonable methods, and strict prevention of difficulties created by staff members, etc.</p>
<p>Second, in the future, in order to facilitate transportation, develop transport, and increase the circulation of goods and the convenience of personnel, all transportation agencies should strive to increase transportation vehicles on the one hand, and improve management on the other. For example, train, ship, and public long-distance bus stations should add more entrances and exits to reduce congestion and save time. This would not only be more convenient for passengers, but the transportation agencies themselves would also feel more convenient. Secondly, setting up more ticket sales agencies can also reduce temporary congestion and confusion. In addition, all levels of staff and laborers at each station must be trained, have a service ethic, and be polite to passengers. They must know that transportation is a commercial undertaking and that passengers are customers. How can they be rude to those who pay to travel by boat or train? Otherwise, the meaning of transportation agencies facilitating civilian travel will be lost.</p>
<p>Finally, we acknowledge that the convenience of transportation also relies on the coordinated efforts of the military police. For example, inspection methods seem to need further improvement, with the primary goal of saving time and facilitating passengers. Similarly, the technical and service ethics training of inspection personnel are necessary conditions for increasing transportation efficiency and reducing passenger difficulties.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that transportation agencies and military police authorities have paid considerable attention to these issues. Now, in the peaceful areas, there are no special circumstances that would cause transportation inconvenience. All phenomena that cause unnecessary suffering to the people should not be allowed to persist. Because the suffering of the general public inevitably provides an opportunity for a few lawless people to do evil. Only when transportation is truly convenient for the general public, and not just a few, will it be possible to improve transportation efficiency, strengthen the coordination of materials and manpower, increase industrial and agricultural production, and consolidate social stability.</p>
<h3>Intense Artillery Battles Erupt in Central Tunisia; War Situation Favors Axis Forces; Several Important Heights Occupied</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German military provided the following information on the Tunisian and Tripolitanian front lines on the 29th: (1) In the central Tunisian region, Axis forces made contact with strong anti-Axis forces on the 29th, engaging in intense artillery battles. The war situation is developing in favor of the Axis forces, and several important heights have been captured by the Axis forces. (2) Axis air forces, braving adverse weather conditions, bombed enemy supply depots and transport routes, and shot down seven enemy aircraft in aerial combat. In addition, an air raid on an enemy air force base destroyed three enemy aircraft on the ground in addition to severely damaging airfield facilities. (3) Enemy air forces attacked Sfax but were intercepted by the Axis air force, suffering heavy damage and fleeing in disarray. (4) The last defensive units of the Axis forces on the Tripolitanian front line engaged in artillery battles with strong enemy forces in the Siala area west of Tripoli.

<h3>Anti-Axis Forces in North Africa Hold Important Meeting; Rumors of Changes in British and American Military Leadership</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – According to London correspondents, military circles in London are saying that the meeting convened by Generals Eisenhower, Alexander, and Marshall at the Allied Command in North Africa is of great importance. The plans for offensives against Tunisia and Europe, formulated at the Casablanca Conference, will be discussed in detail at this meeting. A well-known pro-British Swedish newspaper, "Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning," reports from London that the Allies are considering launching a large-scale operation on the Tunisian front. Recent information received in London regarding the situation in Tunisia is contradictory, making it difficult to judge the current war situation. The attention of military circles in London is now focused on the threat posed by the American forces behind the Mareth Line. According to semi-official sources, the American forces have reached the strategically important town of Maknassy, but it has not yet been confirmed whether the town has been occupied. The Allies' objective seems to be to break through the Axis forces' rear in order to sweep the Axis positions from the south.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – The British-American military leadership operations meeting held in Algiers concluded on the 29th. According to reports from Algiers, as a result of the meeting's agreements, there will be changes in the British-American military leadership in North Africa. It is expected that the commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, Eisenhower, and the commander of the British First Army, General Alexander, will be replaced. Announcements are expected next week.</p>

<h3>Anti-British Sentiment Among Indians Intensifies; Attack on British Military Barracks; Indian Governor Negotiates Military Leases with the United States</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – Anti-British revolutions in the Northwest Frontier Province of India have intensified due to the 26th Indian Independence Declaration Commemoration Day. According to a broadcast from the Indian radio station on the 28th, the Pashtun tribes, with the Red Shirts as the core, led by Baftan Kiryal, launched a large-scale attack on the British military barracks and armory in Peshawar, killing many British officers, soldiers, and technicians at that time. It is reported that water, telecommunications, and telephone lines were also cut off, and the British military roads and railways leading to the border were also destroyed early on.

<h3>Tenth Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule; Hitler Delivers Address, Read by Goebbels; Recounting Achievements of the Past Decade</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – Today is the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. Fuehrer Hitler was unable to attend the commemorative meeting due to overseeing the war effort at the Eastern Front's headquarters. He specifically had a speech drawn up by the headquarters, which was read by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. The main points are as follows: Hitler first described that on this day ten years ago, President Hindenburg authorized him to form a government, and then described the situation created by the Treaty of Versailles, which caused Germany to lose its military defensive capabilities, be deprived of all rights politically, and become economically bankrupt forever. Therefore, the result of the Treaty of Versailles caused Germany to face economic bankruptcy. Hitler then mentioned his first proclamation, in which he declared his determination to unify the country to eliminate the emotional turmoil within the country and resist the oppression imposed from abroad. Then, he recounted the achievements of the National Socialist Party's rule over the past decade, claiming that "Over the years, my work to rebuild Germany has been deeply supported by comrades and compatriots, so the problem of unemployment has been solved, Jewish criminals have been purged, agriculture has been stabilized, the economy has flourished, and the nation's finances have been ordered in a well-organized manner."</p>
<p>General Goering Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – On the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, German General Goering delivered a broadcast address to German officers and soldiers, stating briefly that Germany has the confidence to defeat the Soviet Union. Fuehrer Hitler's decision to destroy Bolshevism is the most important decision in Europe historically. All countries must recognize that if Germany collapses, the Soviet Union will not be stopped by any neutral country. Bolshevism will ravage the entire Europe, so Germany is the pillar of blood to resist Bolshevism. The Soviet army's winter offensive is the "final great offensive." The Soviet Union has used all its manpower. I firmly believe that the Soviet army headquarters has used the most brutal methods to engage all reserve troops in the current offensive. The German army has repeatedly defeated the Soviet army and will continue to defeat the Soviet army in the future. For the next thousand years, the German people will surely still understand that the German army in Stalingrad has laid the foundation for the final victory. Any nation with the fighting spirit of the German army in Stalingrad will surely achieve victory. If the German army in Stalingrad had not restrained sixty, seventy, or eighty Soviet divisions, then the Soviet army's attempt to break through the German line would have been realized. At present, the Soviet army has lost the opportunity. The German army has organized its resistance and consolidated its new line of defense. The German army headquarters knows the magnitude of the Soviet army's losses. The German army in Stalingrad must resist. They will fight to the death for Germany's survival if necessary. Those who hope to compromise with Bolshevism are utterly foolish. The current question is whether the German nation will be annihilated or whether the German nation will control its future. Only Germany can destroy Bolshevism in European countries. Germany has become the guarantor of Europe's destiny. The German army will launch a new offensive in the spring, just like last year. This spring's offensive will not be weaker than last year. Germany will compensate for the losses in Stalingrad with new troops and new weapons. Germany will also have a day of retaliation for the British air raids on German women and children. After the end of the Eastern Front war and the total destruction of the Soviet resistance, the German air force will take revenge on Britain. I will firmly remember the facts and have the determination to strike. General Goering, at the end of his ninety-minute speech, on behalf of the German army, made a guarantee to make any sacrifice for Fuehrer Hitler. He said, "Fuehrer Hitler will lead us to achieve Germany's greatest victory." Goering delivered his speech in the Hall of Honor of the German Aviation Ministry today. Military leaders and National Socialist Party leaders were in attendance. He had changed the time three times and began the speech at noon, which was the moment ten years ago when General Hindenburg ordered National Socialist Party leader Hitler to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>Mr. Hori Reviews Germany's Great Achievements; Tokyo, 30th (Domei News Agency) – Today marks the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule in Germany.

<h3>The Tank Division Launches a Counterattack; One Soviet Division Routed; The German Army on the Middle Don River Achieves Remarkable Feats; The Situation in Stalingrad Unchanged</h3>
<p>Fuehrer Hitler's Headquarters, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – This afternoon's German military report stated that fierce battles continue at several points on the southern route of the Eastern Front. The intensity of the Soviet offensive in other areas seems to have decreased slightly. The situation in Stalingrad remains unchanged. The defenders continue to resist. Our forces are moving freely between the Caucasus and the Don River, unaffected by enemy interference. Our positions on the middle reaches of the Donets River were subjected to fierce enemy attacks several times. The enemy made no progress and suffered heavy losses. Our counterattack routed one Soviet infantry division. South of Lake Ladoga, the enemy launched another large-scale offensive under the cover of tanks and artillery. After a fierce battle, 42 enemy tanks were destroyed, and the enemy retreated without success. On the middle reaches of the Don River, the German 24th Army and the Italian Alpine Army achieved remarkable feats. Volunteer soldiers composed of Soviet people also participated in our operations.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – The fiercest fighting on the Eastern Front is currently west and southwest of Voronezh. The Soviet High Command has apparently concentrated a large army there. Whether the Soviet army will launch an offensive from Voronezh itself or shift the center of the war hundreds of kilometers south is still a question. Therefore, although the war zone between the Donets and Don Rivers is currently still calm, the Soviet army has the potential to launch a fierce attack there. The details of the fighting on the Eastern Front are described as follows: The greatest pressure from the Soviet army is currently being applied northwest of Voronezh, which is located at the dividing line between the southern and central routes of the Eastern Front. Although the Soviet army has made slight progress here, the sacrifices are huge, and the gains are not worth the losses. Many of the villages that the Soviet side has claimed to have occupied are currently still under German control. In addition, the number of reserve troops concentrated by the German army headquarters is very large. Only a portion of them is currently being used. As soon as the time is right, a large-scale counterattack will be launched. The fighting on the lower reaches of the Don River, between the Don and Manych Rivers, and south of the Manych has temporarily stopped. The situation in the Kuban region has also not changed. The position of the German army in western Caucasus has not been shaken. In addition to repelling the Soviet army's offensive, the German army inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In this battle, a total of 1,000 Soviet soldiers were captured. The fighting south of Lake Ladoga is not as fierce as before. The Soviet army's offensive in this area has not been successful.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 30th (Domei News Agency) – U.S. Lend-Lease Director Stettinius reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that although China is a major battlefield in this world war, we have unfortunately failed to fully supply it. Because transportation was extremely difficult before and after the fall of Burma, all military supplies now have to fly over the world's highest mountains in extremely difficult conditions. In terms of Chongqing's needs, the quantity is really like a drop in the bucket, insignificant, he said.</p>

<h3>Headquarters of the Independence League Broadcasts to All the People of India; Calling on Indians to Accept Japan's Aid for Indian Independence; Burma to Hold a Mass Rally to Thank Japan</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 30th (Central News Agency) – The headquarters of the Indian Independence League in Bangkok was deeply excited after receiving the news that Japanese Prime Minister Tojo had reaffirmed Japan's determination to support India's struggle for independence. It dispatched personnel on the night of the 29th to deliver a broadcast address, calling on all the people of India to rise up together and strongly stating that all Indians should henceforth accept Japan's assistance without hesitation. The main points are recorded as follows: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo yesterday reaffirmed that Japan is deeply sympathetic to India's struggle for independence and has decided to support it, which is truly worthy of our gratitude. Oh, my Indian compatriots! Our struggle has been in an isolated and helpless state since 1857, and now we have obtained Japan's assistance. This statement from Japan is tantamount to sending a million reinforcements. Before declaring Japan's attitude towards India, Prime Minister Tojo also agreed to recognize Burma's independence. Burma, which has been under British oppression together with us, has now obtained Japan's thorough support and is about to gain the glory of complete independence, which is truly enviable. However, compatriots, you should know that although Japan has decided to give us the same glory as Burma, whether it can be realized depends on how you act and how comprehensively you accept Japan's national strength.</p>
<p>Manila, 30th (Central News Agency) – Several branch chiefs and representatives of the Indian Independence League in the Philippines visited the military administration of the Philippines Island at 11:00 AM on the 30th, expressing gratitude for the goodwill expressed by Prime Minister Tojo in his parliamentary speech and stating their determination to complete Indian independence.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese Indians and Chinese in this area were all grateful for Prime Minister Tojo's statements regarding Burma and India.

Chief Minister Ba Maw explained the meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's statement allowing Burma to become independent. Then, Burmese folk representative U Tun Tin proposed that all Burmese people should express their deep gratitude to the Japanese government for allowing Burma to become independent. The whole room unanimously passed the proposal. It was also decided on the spot to hold a mass rally to thank Japan.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the US-China Air Force in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to recent intelligence obtained from the area, the US-China Air Force in Chongqing suffered greatly due to the intense operations of the Japanese Air Force from December 8th of last year until the beginning of this year. The current situation of the US-China Air Force is as follows: (1) The US-China Air Force's attempts to conduct air raids on Japan have been thwarted due to the brave attacks of the Japanese Army Air Force. Most of the frontline aircraft have been destroyed, forcing them to retreat inland and work hard to replenish their combat power. (2) The US-China Air Force has a total strength of about 150 fighter and bomber aircraft. One-half is mobilized on the front line. According to prisoners, Commander General Chennault is an excellent general, but the quality of the lower-ranking officers is generally very low. (3) The Chongqing Air Force, dispersed in the interior, is now working hard to study tactics under the guidance of US Air Force officers. US aid to Chongqing has gradually increased since July and August of last year, reaching about 140 aircraft by the end of January of this year. However, many of the fighter aircraft imported from the Soviet Union since the previous year are unusable and are only used for training in the rear. When the Chongqing Air Force blindly bombed Jingmen last year, the Japanese side shot down two aircraft with ground fire and captured Shen Dexian, the head of Chinese aviation affairs in Chongqing. According to Shen, Chongqing students sent to the United States are assigned to the Air Force after returning, but there are not many aircraft, so there are few opportunities to participate in actual combat. From this point of view, one can determine the combat power of the Chongqing Air Force.</p>
<h3>Riots in the Capital of South Africa</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - The American "Time Weekly" reported that native workers in the capital of the Union of South Africa recently engaged in large-scale riots.

The quantity of edible oil purchased by each household and the market price will remain the same as during the previous sale, with each person limited to purchasing one jin of edible oil at a price of 7.1 yuan, to meet the needs of citizens during the Lunar New Year. However, sales are limited to being sold out within one or two days. Oil sales will be suspended from the 3rd to the 8th. As for the implementation of the method of distributing oil based on household population, the edible oil wholesale office held a meeting yesterday to discuss it, but no proper method has been decided yet. This is because the office has consistently failed to fully communicate with various Lianbao districts, and there are conflicting opinions. According to a Central News Agency reporter who inquired with relevant parties, after the general conclusion, the Lianbao districts under the jurisdiction of each police station will still be the pilot areas for selling oil using the population-based distribution strategy.</p>

<h3>After the Results of the Elementary School Group Screening are Announced - Assistance Funds Will Be Disbursed on the Same Day - Lists of 5th and 6th Graders Will Be Announced in the Next Few Days - Students Should Pay Attention to the Time for Collecting Funds</h3>
<p>The list of students receiving assistance from the 4th Shen Bao Student Aid Fund for the elementary school group will be announced tomorrow. University students will come to the office for interviews starting tomorrow. Over 5,000 yuan in donations have been received from all sectors yesterday. The amount still falls short of the total student aid funds to be disbursed. The end of the lunar year is fast approaching, and the time for students to enroll is imminent. At this time when student aid funds are still in great need of donations, it is hoped that all sectors will continue to contribute to complete the student aid work of this session.</p>
<p>Elementary School Group Has Completed Review of General Scores and Reflections</p>
<p>The elementary school group has reviewed more than 800 test papers from students applying for student aid. Teachers from various schools were hired to grade them. The Student Aid Office sent personnel to investigate the family conditions of each student. The final review has been completed. It has been decided to announce the lists of students in the 5th grade on February 1st and the 6th grade on February 2nd, as well as the number of students approved for assistance. Students can bring their registration certificates to the office to collect the funds from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM and from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM on the 1st and 2nd of February after the announcement. The following are some reflections on the scores of the students in this screening: (1) General scores have improved compared to the previous session. (2) The scores of students from schools with higher tuition fees have not been in direct proportion. (3) Only 60% of the Chinese language scores are satisfactory. (4) Students in the 5th grade who were selected as top candidates have extremely difficult family circumstances, and the tuition fees at their schools are also relatively low. However, their academic performance is remarkable. (5) The physical fitness of some students is not healthy, and malnutrition is the main cause. In addition, other points that are worth recording or should be corrected will be solemnly pointed out by the teachers in charge of the examination after the student aid work of this session is completed and will be published in this newspaper successively.</p>
<p>University Group is Reviewing Transcripts - Should Be Submitted Quickly</p>
<p>The university group has approximately 400 students and is currently reviewing their transcripts. The investigation of the family circumstances of each student has also begun. Those with relatively wealthy family circumstances will be eliminated to ensure the proper use of student aid funds. It has been decided to send letters to a portion of university students to come to the office for interviews on January 2nd. Only those who receive a notice will be interviewed. The rest are being investigated separately. University students who have not yet submitted their transcripts should send them as soon as possible without delay.</p>

<h3>Poor and Sick Relief Association Reviews Grant Applications from Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>In accordance with its charter, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association uses all of the donations it raises to subsidize charitable organizations in the city. However, the review of applicants for subsidies is extremely strict. The members of the review committee are all well-known lawyers, accountants, doctors, and education experts in Shanghai who serve purely on a voluntary basis. Each time a grant application is reviewed, one or more committee members are designated to conduct a detailed on-site investigation to thoroughly understand the organization's operations and financial situation before submitting a final report to the plenary meeting for discussion. Only those organizations with truly effective operations and insufficient funds can be approved for subsidies. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the 7th Review Committee meeting was held at the Hang Seng Bank Club on Hong Kong Road, with over 20 committee members in attendance. The applicants for grants included: the Shanghai Relief and Education Institute for Refugee Children, Renji Shantang, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, the Chinese Christian Young Women's Association Nursery, the Shanghai Christian Refugee Children's Education Institute, the China Women and Children Relief Federation, the Bethel Orphanage, and the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home. All of the committee members attended on time with a passion for disaster relief. The cases that were approved will have the funds disbursed after the resolutions are passed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council All Official Documents</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the current situation, has decided that all announcements, notices, license regulations, and receipts will soon be changed to use Japanese as the primary language. However, Chinese or English may be used when necessary. Starting from February, the Council's gazette will be printed in Japanese. The Japanese version of the annual report will continue to be published. Furthermore, meetings of the Council and its committees will be conducted primarily in Japanese, and meeting minutes will also be recorded in Japanese. However, for the convenience of other foreign nationals, the original Japanese text will be translated into English.</p>
<p>7,000 Chinese and Foreign Employees to be Taught Japanese Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that, in view of the recent enthusiasm of employees for learning Japanese, preparations have been completed and Japanese will be taught to approximately 7,000 Chinese and foreign employees starting from February 1st. At that time, Japanese language courses will be taught separately according to the nature of the employees' work, so that each employee can acquire basic knowledge of formal Japanese or ordinary Japanese conversation. Starting from the above date, classes will be held for one hour each day. The elementary class is expected to be completed within one year. In the future, employees who pass specific examinations will be considered for cash bonuses as an incentive. It is reported that senior Chinese and foreign employees of the Council and all Chinese officers of the Police Department have already been studying Japanese in their spare time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Urges Surrender of Equipment of Shanghai Volunteers</h3>
<p>Former members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps who have not yet returned their equipment or supplies are requested to send them to the former Shanghai Volunteer Corps storage room at 170 or to any police station for inventory as soon as possible to complete the procedures. Those who are far away or inconvenient to deliver in person should call 16008 or 10185 to notify the former Shanghai Volunteer Corps Records Office so that arrangements can be made to send someone to collect them.</p>
<h3>Current Factory Situation Authorities Increase Food Rations for Workers and Coolies - Propose to Double the Amount to Maintain Work Efficiency</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Factory United Office believes that the quantity of food rations for workers and coolies is insufficient for consumption, which is of great importance to the production of manufacturers and the transportation efficiency of the city. Therefore, it has made a special request to the Shanghai Municipal Council and formulated two methods, which read as follows: "Since the distribution of food based on household population, residents in the area have generally felt that the allocated food is not enough to satisfy them, but the general working class feels even more difficult. These laborers are the elements of production. The supply of all daily necessities, as well as transportation, public utilities, all rely on the labor force. If food rations are not provided or are insufficient, all production factories and transportation agencies will be in danger of stopping. This will harm local order and affect the city's security. This is extremely important. The methods proposed by our association are as follows: (1) Increase the rice rations for workers in each factory. The amount should be doubled according to the actual number of workers in each factory so that the production work of each factory will not be interrupted. (2) Increase the source of flour and distribute it to stores that manufacture flour foods, especially stores that sell large cakes and fried dough sticks, which are the only food for rickshaw pullers and coolies. It should not be lacking for a day, and the quantity should be increased and supplied continuously to maintain the lives of ordinary coolies. The above two items are urgent measures for today. It is hoped that your office will adopt and implement them. The food and production prospects of the city depend on it. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Public Concession."</p>

<h3>American Pharmacy Heir Sibling Murder Case: Xu Daquan Executed by Hanging Yesterday Morning; Repenting at Death, He Pleaded to Say Farewell to His Parents</h3>
<p>The sensational case of the murder by the heir of the Huamei Pharmacy, in which the principal offender Xu Daquan, after being sentenced to death by the Supreme Court in the third instance, finally reached a final verdict. Now, under the instruction of the Judicial Administration, the execution was carried out yesterday morning by transferring him to the Nanshi execution ground for hanging. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime</p>
<p>Xu Daquan is currently twenty-three years old and lives at 26 Pushi Road in the French Concession, together with his elder brother Xu Songyao. Their father, Xu Xiangsun, is a prominent businessman in the city with substantial wealth. He successively opened the Huamei Pharmacy, Jihua Hospital, and Shengsheng Maternity School, earning a considerable reputation. Xu Xiangsun, being old and ill, entrusted the management of Huamei Pharmacy and family affairs to Xu Songyao. Xu Daquan initially went to Hong Kong to study, then returned to Shanghai for medical treatment. He deeply indulged in Xu Xiangsun's doting, frequenting dance halls and spending lavishly. He often asked his brother Songyao for money, leading to resentment. The cause of the incident stemmed from a dispute over Xu Songyao buying a pipe, which occurred around half past five in the afternoon of the 21st day of the tenth month of the thirtieth year. On that day, at around 5 PM, taking advantage of Songyao's unpreparedness upon returning home for rest, Daquan used a wood-splitting axe to strike Songyao's head violently, hitting him eight times, penetrating five places, causing him to fall immediately. His father heard the noise and rushed over, but Daquan had already fled back to his bedroom in panic. The next morning, Songyao was sent to Shishi Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of the injuries, rescue efforts were ineffective. He died on the 26th of the same month at 4 PM. After the incident, the principal offender Xu Daquan was arrested and imprisoned. This is the factual account of the crime.</p>
<p>The Execution Ground Was Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>At 8:10 AM, Xu was escorted to the Nanshi Chegu Road execution ground under the close guard of judicial police. As he was being taken off the prison van, Luo Junqiang, the Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, and Man Qiwei, the director of the Special Ordinance Medical School Management Office, personally led ten armed tax police to the scene for security. The Municipal Police Bureau also dispatched police for security. A large crowd of onlookers attended the execution.</p>
<h3>Our Weapons</h3>
<p>— Feng Jie</p>
<p>Broadcast speech on Shanghai Radio yesterday</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, we have declared war on Britain and America! If we want to defeat Britain and America, we must have weapons. What are our weapons? First, our weapon is to awaken the consciousness of East Asian nations for independence and autonomy. As the Greater East Asia War has developed to the current stage, the footholds of Anglo-American imperialism in East Asia have already been recovered by our friendly nation, Japan. Therefore, Britain and America will never be able to overcome our East Asian front. Our vanguard ally, Japan, now has only one aim: to create division among the East Asian nations within the Japanese sphere of influence, to instigate, manipulate, and exploit them. We can see their intentions by observing how Britain and America are desperately clinging to Chongqing, which is already powerless. Second, our weapon is to assist Japan in completing the war. Britain and America also know that their offensive against the Japanese army can only become empty talk on paper, so they want to economically trap Japan. According to their calculations, America, with its abundant resources, can use submarines to disrupt transportation and cut off maritime trade, exhausting Japan's resources, at which point Japan will naturally surrender. However, their calculations will only be effective if the East Asian nations do not cooperate with Japan. As long as we do our best to assist Japan, Britain and America will have no way to distress them. And our assistance to Japan in completing the war becomes a powerful weapon for us to fight against Britain and America. Third, our weapon is the national spiritual mobilization to consolidate the East Asian front. Anglo-American imperialists believe that the National Government and the people who govern China today, under Japanese military power, are lifeless and dispirited. However, we cannot look at China today in this way. China's independent and autonomous declaration of war means that it is a friend of Japan, not a colony of Japan. The Chinese people, for the sake of the restoration of their motherland, must rise up to share the responsibility of defending East Asia. To defend East Asia, we must cooperate with the Japanese. Therefore, the Chinese people's national spiritual mobilization to assist Japan and consolidate the East Asian front is precisely the opposite of what Britain and America desire. This is their fatal wound, and it is also our most powerful weapon. At the same time, in strategic application, military affairs must be coordinated with politics. Only by achieving a clear military objective through political success can strategic methods be properly applied. Anglo-American imperialists have already realized that a purely military approach is insufficient in the war against Japan, and they are also employing political and economic means. Therefore, our weapons are also political and economic. We must use a tit-for-tat political and economic approach as our weapon. This is the only weapon to defeat Britain and America.</p>

<h3>Cultural Stocks Surge: Commercial Press Soars by Thirty Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for Chinese stocks was limited, because Saturday met the Spring Festival holiday, but a few colleagues were still doing some business in secret.

<h3>Government Bonds Remain Firm: Competition Not As Fierce As Previous Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bond prices were slightly firmer compared to the previous day, but due to Saturday, trading was extremely light. Only domestic bonds had some activity, while other types of bonds had very few transactions. The trend seemed to be strong, as the selling party had repeatedly pressured the market in recent days, but the market remained very firm. Currently, due to the longer New Year holiday, competition has decreased. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially traded at 7.5 yuan, rising to around 8 yuan, then falling back to 8.23 yuan.

<h3>Bitter Almonds Sought After by Both Traders and Customers</h3>
<p>Bitter almonds are becoming increasingly popular due to the lack of incoming supply, and the market trend is gradually improving. The current high market price is quoted at over 700 yuan, up by over 100 yuan, and the outlook is still positive.</p>

<h3>Last Year's Woolen Fabric Market: Rising Steadily</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market in the 31st year was thriving, and the profits of various stores all exceeded previous records. In January, due to the Pacific War, people were uneasy, and there was nothing worth mentioning. In early February, due to the end of the lunar year, transactions were scarce and prices were weak. In the second half of the month, the market turned red, prices were improving, street sales were smooth, road transport was free, and hoarders became active again, pushing prices above the red plate. Paisi, Huada and Thin Serge saw particularly rapid increases. In early March, Spring sales and sales from Nanjing high street were strong, there were many stockpiles, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. Standard daily prices rose rapidly, accelerating further during the month. At this time, the Woolen Fabric Trade Association, the Woolen Spinning Association, the Wool Dyeing and Weaving Association, and the Wool Cold Trade Association, jointly formed the Woolen Fabric Industry Production and Sales Joint Association, to carry out centralized registration, limited mobile transport orders, etc. In April, (1) due to less incoming production, inventories gradually became depleted; (2) because woolen fabrics were not yet controlled, transportation could be done with mobile permits; (3) due to the increase in the new currency, averaging up to 0.3 yuan, various reasons caused non-industry owners with assets to hoard goods, and the market rose like a horse without reins, with prices rising by 30-40 yuan compared to March. In May, the momentum continued to move forward bravely. From June 8th to 20th, all transactions were based on the new currency, and wealthy people continued to blindly buy in. In July, the authorities stabilized prices and implemented strict restrictions, and retail prices mostly automatically decreased, but wholesale market prices still declined less. At the same time, without association transport orders, truck deliveries were often hindered, and hoarders had to contact woolen fabric or Western clothing operators to formally establish a company name and join the association. In August, due to strict investigations by the authorities, actual sales declined and prices fell. In September, there were no major fluctuations, and prices were mostly stable. After mid-September, the authorities formally limited prices, mostly based on weight, which was difficult for outsiders to identify. In addition, the limited prices were slightly more lenient than market prices, people's hearts were stable, and they began to stir again. In October, sales did not improve, and the authorities reduced the limited prices by 2%, people's hearts turned weak, and market transactions decreased. All stores adopted the principle of following the market, leading to a clear price decline. In early November, due to Xuzhou, Nanjing, and Bengbu customers purchasing, the trend gradually turned around. At the same time, sales in men's and women's clothing stores on this street improved, and business was also good. From the 1st to the 28th, grass green and primary color breeches serge first increased, and wealthy people in the industry began to hoard and absorb considerable goods. Light goods made of broken serge and wool were particularly popular. Outsiders followed the lead of insiders, and hoarding was also fierce. Therefore, in December, prices rose sharply from beginning to end, mostly matching the limited prices, and in some cases even exceeding the limited prices. The market atmosphere was unprecedentedly brisk, with more buyers than sellers, and owners treated their goods as rare commodities, unaffected by transport restrictions. As the end of the year approached, the impact of tight money was observed. The outlook for the market is still trending upward.</p>
<h3>Soap and Candle Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's daily necessities market trend was stable. Transactions were less active due to the approaching end of the year, so the price of various goods changed very little. However, it was generally no different from the previous day. Beauty brand matches were priced at 4,200 yuan per box, Phoenix brand at 4,000 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 3,400 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,250 yuan. Gu Ben soap was priced at 790 yuan per box, Baixiangmao 720 yuan, Huangxiangmao 660 yuan, and Scissor soap 750 yuan. Bailey's foreign candles were priced at 560 yuan per box, Monk's Hat brand at 480 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 340 yuan.</p>
<h3>Daily Use Medicines and Sundries: Spring Sales Active; Buyers Raise Prices, Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for medicines and sundries was driven by active spring sales, attracting the attention of wealthy people. Under the pulling of hoarders, market prices continued to rise. Golden Tower Oil was priced at 52.5 yuan per dozen, Headache Powder 40 yuan, Bagua Dan 46 yuan, Partridge Vegetables 76 yuan, and Dragon and Tiger Ren Dan 40 yuan.</p>

<h3>Inheriting the Precious Legacy of the East</h3>
<p>— Sun Xingrang</p>
<p>The precious legacy of the East is indeed too much. Here, I will only talk about a book related to the art of war—namely, Sun Tzu's Art of War, which enjoys considerable international reputation. I think in this era of fire everywhere and global turmoil, when countries are at a critical juncture of deciding life and death through war, it naturally has new significance for existence.</p>
<p>Textual Research of the Book</p>
<p>Sun Tzu's Art of War was written by Sun Wu of Qi during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The Historical Records, Biography of Sun Tzu, records thirteen chapters of Sun Wu's book, while the Book of Han, Art and Literature Records, records eighty-two chapters of Sun Tzu's Art of War and nine volumes of illustrations. Therefore, Zhang Shoujie's Justice uses thirteen chapters as the upper volume, and there are also middle and lower volumes. Du Mu also said that Wu's book originally had hundreds of thousands of words, all of which were cut and refined by Cao Cao to form this medicine. However, the Historical Records precedes the Book of Han, and it is often used as the basis, while the others may not be credible. Ye Shi suspected that the person was not seen in the Zuo Zhuan, and suspected that the book was written by a hermit in the mountains and forests at the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States period. However, the Historical Records record that Guan Lu said to Wu, "I have read all of your thirteen chapters," which proves that it was indeed written by Sun Wu without any doubt—as stated in Gongyang Shou's A Collection of Chinese Military Books.</p>
<p>About the Annotations on the Book</p>
<p>Many people have annotated Sun Tzu's Art of War, some focusing on military strategy and some on theory, each with its own strengths. The first person to annotate this book was Cao Cao. Later, Wang Ling of Wei, Zhang Zishang, Jia Yi, Wu Shen, and You Du had commentaries, but unfortunately, they have all been lost. By the Song Dynasty, Ji Tianbao had ten annotated versions, the ten being: (1) Emperor Wu of Wei (i.e., Cao Cao) (2) Meng of Liang (3) Li Quan of Tang (4) Du Mu (5) Chen Hao (6) Jia Lin (7) Mei Shengyu of Song (8) Wang Xi (9) He Yanxi (10) Zhang Yu. In addition, there are Sun Hao and Ji Xie and others, which I will not list in detail. As for those who annotate this book in modern times, Jiang Fangzhen of Haining's Sun Tzu's New Interpretation (1913) and Gongyang Shou of Changshu's Philosophical Research on Sun Tzu's Art of War are more famous. Jiang studied in Japan and Germany and was one of China's leading military experts. In his annotations, he cross-references the principles of this book with Clausewitz's The Great War and Berloher's Theory of Strategy and Moltke's History of the Franco-Prussian War, with many original insights. The latter focuses more on philosophical research and has no historical references, but it is also quite essential.</p>
<p>Re-evaluation of Value</p>
<p>No matter how advanced weapons are or how novel tactics are, the basic principles of war remain unchanged by time and space. A few examples can show the profundity and breadth of Sun Tzu's theory. For example, the Chapter on Planning says: "War is a matter of great importance to the state." Jiang's interpretation of the word "war" is the meaning of war. Now, no country is willing to easily start a war, because war is a major event for a country, related to survival and extinction, and must be carefully considered before a decision is made. Another example is the Chapter on Offensive Planning: "Therefore, to win a hundred battles is not the best of excellence; to subdue the enemy's army without fighting is the best of excellence. Therefore, the way to use troops is to keep the country intact is best, to destroy the country is next; to keep the army intact is best, to destroy the army is next." Once a war begins, the consumption of national power must be great. Therefore, in modern times, countries want to achieve a certain national purpose and hope to use strategic success instead of armed conflict. This is the meaning of this. Also, assuming that the war has already begun, or after surrounding an enemy city, the first thing to do is to send a letter of surrender, hoping to capture it without attacking. This method of preserving strength is also nothing more than the application of this principle. I think there is no shortage of examples of the application and compliance with various principles in this war of East, West, South, and North, which can be confirmed.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said that Sun Tzu's Art of War is a book of military philosophy in our country. It is necessary to read it. This book is not only an essential book for those who govern the army in our country, but foreigners are also often studying and applying it. Japan has long had a translation of this book, which is a must-read for military officers. In Germany, it is said that there is also a translation of this book (Jiang once saw it). This is definitely not a reckless statement. Historical records show that during the Warring States period in Japan, the brave general Takeda Shingen used the warning phrase "Swift as the wind, serene as the forest, plundering as fire, immovable as a mountain" as a motto and inscribed it on his banners as a guideline for implementing mobile warfare, which shows the value of this book. After this World War ends, there will be a newly annotated version of Sun Tzu's Art of War published, which is beyond doubt, just as Ouyang Xiu said: "The key to military strategy is to be unpredictable."</p>
<p>I still remember when Mr. Jiang Fangzhen was studying in Berlin, he met Berdromay, the director of the Operations Department of the Prussian Army Headquarters during the Franco-Prussian War. When he said goodbye, the general stroked his shoulder and said: "Be good at it, I hope your sincerity will be implemented. I have heard that Napoleon said that a hundred years later, a military strategist from the East will emerge to inherit the principles of ancient teachings and become a great enemy of Europeans. Be good at it." Alas! Now Mr. Jiang has suddenly returned to the mountains. In the future, who will be the Eastern military strategist? I really cannot make a rash guess.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Fragrant Snow Garden to View Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Jing Wan</p>
<p>In the flower market of the past few days, daffodils, nandinas, and wintersweets have appeared together. I happened to find a few elegant potted plum blossoms in the display window of the New Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road. The posture was old, and the flowers were not abundant. The pots were also inscribed with elegant names, such as "Plum Blossom Recluse," "Crane Release Pavilion," and "Luofu Flying Arrival," which were produced by the "Fragrant Snow Garden" hosted by Zhou Shoujuan, of course, they are different from the ordinary. However, these few pots cannot satisfy my desire, I got the instructions from the garden address sign next to the pot, and led me to the garden at 27 Kader Road.</p>
<p>After finding the garden address and stepping onto a few stone steps, I saw small works on bamboo shelves, exquisite and lovely. Suddenly, I glimpsed a huge ancient plum tree in the corridor, planted in a large rectangular ancient pot. The bark was mottled and ancient, like a "wrinkled, thin, transparent" rockery stone. Branches stretched out from the top, crisscrossing, like a swimming dragon, with many flowers on the branches, just about to bloom. A masterpiece by the famous painter Qian Shoutie was hung on the wall, taking a photo of the ancient plum tree. On both sides were couplets written by Chen Dingshan, with the words "Open the window on a sunny day, the flower whiskers are warm" and "Righteous people, eternal chivalrous spirit," which also fit the ancient plum tree. Originally, it was the Righteous Plum, which has attracted the appreciation of many poets and painters in the past two years. It is said to come from the tomb of the Five Righteous Men in Huqiu, Suzhou, which is a relic of the Ming Dynasty and has been around for three or four hundred years. No wonder it is so old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Inside the corridor is a garden, with many small potted plum blossoms on display. They are all full of scholarly and poetic meaning, red plum, green plum, cliff plum, cold friend, etc.? The colors are complete, matched with exquisite figures and pavilions, complementing each other, and also titled "Hermitage of the Lonely Mountain," "Waiting for the Crane to Come," "Boating on Plum Island," "Plum Blossom Study," "Sparse Shadow Slanting," "Branch of Yuling," etc., making it even more elegant and interesting, and it cannot be compared with those more or less same potted plum blossoms on the market.

<h3>Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (4)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>——To My Daughter</p>
<p>Moreover, some, even if true, are too wasteful. Like Lao Laizi, who, even in his seventies, still wore colorful clothes and cried like a baby. It would be better to do something else earlier, which would be more fulfilling for oneself, others, and one's parents. That could also be considered filial piety. Secondly, I believe that those who created stories of filial sons seemed to be not very filial themselves. Their impressions of their own parents were not good, which led to their unfavorable impressions of parents throughout history. The parents in their stories are often cruel, harsh, and eccentric, possessing a "child abuse" (forgive my coinage) trait, which is far from the usual situation. In Semyonov's "Hunger," the father is reluctant to give food to his children, which is a special case. During great turmoil, food is too difficult to obtain, which inevitably reveals the selfish side of human nature. Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" writes about the conflict between the old and new ideas of fathers and sons, avoiding direct confrontation. In reality, direct confrontations may be even more cruel. Parents interfering with their children's thoughts or marriages is quite common. But this is limited to situations where parents are particularly backward and children are particularly progressive, and parents do not necessarily have a cruel heart towards their children. In "Dream of the Red Chamber," Jia Zheng is very strict with Baoyu, and I have also written that my mother often beat me. This was all because of teaching and the mistaken belief that beating was teaching, which cannot be said to be abuse. On the contrary, it was because of love. As the saying goes, "Only the melon loves the vine, not the vine loves the melon." Parents mostly love their children, and their love is probably more sincere than children's love for their parents. However, the parents in the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars are often very different. Shun's parents tried desperately to kill him, and although his mother was a stepmother, and she was partial, why did she have to kill him? Moreover, the father is always one's own. Huang Xiang's parents watched their son fend off mosquitoes without making a sound themselves. Lao Laizi's parents knew that their son was in his seventies and still made him carry water, which is already very strange. Wang Xiang and Meng Zong's mothers, as adults, insisted on asking small children for carp and bamboo shoots in winter.</p>
<h3>Reflections After Reading Nie Yuntai's "Method of Preserving Wealth" - 3</h3>
<p>— Lingnan Hermit</p>
<p>Equality is linked to cause, freedom is established by one's own ability.</p>
<p>Natural talents have differences in usage, and the benefits of the land have no fixed right.</p>
<p>Dogs and horses are supplied for driving and use, and cattle and sheep are readily slaughtered and cooked;</p>
<p>Flowers in bloom are worth enjoying together, and ripe melons can be used to season soup.</p>
<p>Fate stops at any time, what level of life is ascended.</p>
<p>The form and spirit come from above and below, education and nurturing are based on the levels of conduct.</p>
<p>Elders should be good at setting examples, and children should work harder;</p>
<p>Benefiting others benefits oneself, and thorough learning becomes the measure.</p>

<h3>The Paragon of Teachers</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>Then they began to argue, Ralston becoming colder and more sarcastic, Chips becoming more ardent and excited. Finally, Ralston said coldly, "Since you force me to tell the truth, Mr. Chipping, then listen carefully. Some time ago, you were not doing much here. Your teaching method is slow and old-fashioned; your personal habits are shabby; you ignore my instructions, which, if done by a younger person, I would take as complete insubordination. I don't want this, Mr. Chipping. You must understand my patience, and I have been patient for so long."</p>
<p>"But—" Chips began, looking completely bewildered; then, he picked up a few words, scattered, from that severely critical speech.</p>
<p>"Shabby—ahem—you said—?"</p>
<p>"Yes, look at your gown. I already know that your gown is a frequent topic of amusement for the whole school."</p>
<p>Chips knew this, but it never seemed to be a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>He continued, "And—you also said—ahem—something about—insubordination—?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't say that. I only said that if a younger person did this, I would consider it insubordination. In your case, it's probably a mixture of slowness and stubbornness. For example, the problem of Latin pronunciation—I think I told you years ago that I wanted the whole school to use the new method. The other teachers obeyed me; but you would rather stick to your old method, resulting in confusion and ineffectiveness."</p>
<p>Finally, Chips found something he could understand and deal with. "Oh, is that so?" he replied disdainfully. "Well, I—ahem—I admit I don't approve of the new pronunciation. I never have. Ahem—it seems like nonsense to me. To have students say "Kiekero" in school—ahem—and then as soon as they leave school, they keep saying "Cicero"—they've always—ahem—said it that way, isn't that better. And instead of saying "Vicissim"—good heavens—you want them to say "Wekissim," ahem—ahem—he constantly chuckled, forgetting that he was in Ralston's study, not in his familiar classroom. (26)</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of the Shanghai Hospital of the World Red Swastika Society</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society was founded by local gentry and merchants through donations. It has a history of more than twenty years and is dedicated to the purpose of disaster relief and assistance to the needy. In addition to setting up soup kitchens, free clinics, and work-study programs for displaced people, it has a sanatorium on Yuyuan Road. The sanatorium was established in 1937. Recently, after Mr. Li Sihao, Li Tianzhen, and Hu Chuqing took on the roles of Chairman of the Board, they have spared no effort in promoting the Society's affairs. The sanatorium has also been thoroughly reorganized and renamed the Shanghai Hospital of the World Red Swastika Society. The medical affairs have been reorganized accordingly. In addition to Dr. Li Bangzheng continuing to serve as the responsible director of the hospital, Dr. Yuan Junchang, the former medical director of the Shanghai Puji Sanatorium, has been hired as a special consulting physician and is in charge of the hospital's Department of Mental and Neurological Diseases. At the same time, he supervises all hospital affairs. Recently, various facilities and treatment methods have been improved. The general internal medicine department is managed by Dr. Rao Youji, the medical director. Resident physicians are on duty day and night to respond to emergencies, providing free diagnosis and medication every morning. The cost of hospitalization is extremely low. The hospital is located at 1171 Yuyuan Road.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Registration for the Scholarship of the Anti-Anglo-American Association</h3>
<p>Registration Procedures Will Continue as Usual Tomorrow and the Day After Tomorrow. Since the Anti-Anglo-American Association launched the first phase of scholarships, those who have gone to register have been extremely crowded, especially in the last two days, when the number of people has been even greater. Unfortunately, the application forms have long been exhausted, resulting in a significant number of students being unable to apply, which is deeply regrettable. It is reported that the scale of the next phase of the scholarship campaign will be larger than this phase, and every poor student will have the opportunity to receive assistance. The Association's handling of the application registration matters this time, with the cooperation of Mr. Zhang Yipeng and the responsible personnel of each group, has been handled very quickly, and the procedures are also quite meticulous. Regarding the qualification examination, it is said that it will probably be held after the Lunar New Year. It is hoped that students will pay attention to the news. The father's registration procedures were originally scheduled to end at 4:00 pm today. However, it is feared that there are still many students who have been unable to register as scheduled due to time constraints or other reasons. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the period for one or two days, and registration procedures will continue as usual tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow Townsmen Association Scholarship Deadline Today</h3>

This semester, it has received a large donation from enthusiastic people and has expanded the number of scholarships for poor students. It is reported that the school's enrollment period has passed, and there are still a few vacancies in each grade. Those who are from poor families and are determined to study can apply quickly.</p>
<h3>Citizens Should Pay Attention to Tuberculosis Prevention</h3>
<p>During this extraordinary period, the number of residents in this city suffering from lung disease tends to increase daily. The service department of the Hongqiao Sanatorium has put forward several warnings to promote tuberculosis prevention and urge the public to pay attention: (1) Modern medicine, both Chinese and foreign, has not yet invented a specific drug for lung disease. (2) Except for pneumothorax therapy for lung disease, there is currently no so-called rapid therapy. (3) To seek a cure for lung disease, the first thing is a correct diagnosis. In order to implement the above measures and popularize early treatment, the hospital has issued X-ray examination and free treatment certificates to help the poor and sick and fundamentally eliminate tuberculosis. The certificate is currently sold on behalf of this library for 10 yuan per certificate. Once lung disease is detected, the most effective modern artificial pneumothorax therapy can be performed free of charge, which is truly good news for those suffering from lung disease and poverty.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: Staff at the sales department of the Zhongxi Great Pharmacy General Distribution Office on 4th. Ma Road picked up some cash along with a note on the afternoon of the 29th around 6PM. Hope that the owner can identify the amount and the information contained on the note within 3 days, or it will be donated to charity.</p>
