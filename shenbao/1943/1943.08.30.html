<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">庸人自擾 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海由於五方雜處，社會情形異常複雜的特徵，一向成為謡言「策源地」，往往隨淸國際及國內時事的演變，有計劃地製造出各種謡言，甚至於「無風起浪」，以便少數投機家及冒險家乘機一混水摸魚」。過去市塲上種種風波，無不由歐美人及本地一部份投機冒險份子的製造謠言開始的，受其損害者，自然是我們的國家，尤其是大多數的市兵，受至謠言的欺騙，輕舉妄動，庸人自擾，結果破產的，不知凡幾。現在上海租界雖巳交回，然而，百年來深入人心的病菌，以及上海複雜的社會內容，要說根本肅淸造謠之根源，還是很困難的。何况，現在是在戰時，是在世界戰爭進入決戰階段的時期，敵人還盡力侵入後方進行各種擾亂的陰謀。</p>
<p>今日企圖利用上海過去的特殊性質與社會之複雜性而隨時製造各種謠言者，第二自然是國際間諜，英美代理人的暗中活躍。第二是重慶份子的播弄風雲，指鹿為馬。第三是本市一般投機商人，他們追求着一己的私利，追求着個人的發財，他們唯一可算是本錢的就是「造謠」的技倆了？他們依靠造謡來擾亂市塲，乘機進行變相的刦掠。</p>
<p>無論是英美間諜，或是重慶份子，或是投機家，造謡終於只是造謠，謠言決不能與事實相衡，謡言而能雊發生作用，不在謡言及造謡者本身，只在市民對於謠言的態度。如果大家能雊認淸謠言只是謡言，不為所動，那麼，任何謡言，就決不會對市面發生影響，造謠者就不攻而自破計不得售了。</p>
<p>近來市面上又忽隱忽顯地發生了種種謡言，這種謠言盡力企圖與國際局勢和政府發生聯系。在明眼人，自然一聞謡言即可斷言其非，一笑置之，可是一般昧於局勢的人，往往因此發生疑惑，墮入造謡者之彀中。實際上，從目前國際局勢來看，東亞時局之穩定，無論是軍事上，政治上，己經　定不拔的基礎，不僅英美的「反攻」不會成功，就是歐洲戰事的任何演變，也不能影響東亞。相反的，現在世界上無諭那一方面，都不能不要求於東亞方面的協力，蘇聯始終維持對日中立，拒不參加奎貝克會議，可為東亞時局穩定的反面證明。</p>
<p>東亞和中國的一切事實設明，市塲任何謡言，畢竟是毫無事實根據的謠言而已。我們自古有一句話，叫做「謡言止於智者」，我們在今日希望大家運用理智，認淸現實，勿為自擾的庸人。因為事實決不是任何謡言所能撼動的，結果一切謠言必然消滅。如果甘受謡言所憑弄因而損失，却不能獲得任何補償的了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">英美蘇三國　在巴爾幹明爭暗鬥 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>巴爾幹因其地理的關係，在現階段的戰局上。其地位極為重要，而目的最惹世人注目的，有如次三點：</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞油田攻防戰。</p>
<p>蘇聯對保加利亞，塞爾雜亞的政治關係，　　　敵方對愛琴海，亞得里亞　的攻擊企圖。</p>
<p>第一個問題</p>
<p>第一，以普勞愛　　為中心的羅馬尼亞汕　、年產煤油七百萬噸，據英美方而的計算，如其完全加以破壞，則佔計德國的戰力將要减低五成，所以英美以為攻擊　油田比東郁戰綫一帶更為重大。英美從事此方面的　重準備，業已數月於茲，在叙利亞，巴勒斯坦擴充空軍基地卒於上月世一日以二百架飛機（英方發表一的大編隊作第一次的空　。</p>
<p>第二個問題</p>
<p>至於屬二個問題，乃是此次羅邱會　的主　　之一在蘇聯　求第二戰綫聲中，蘇聯在巴爾幹的地位，不難想像，在蘇聯方面，開　第二戰綫，自　希望，但在英美方面，則主張除轟炸德國西北部之外，同時再破壞德國的燃料補充某地及殺倉，在巴爾幹方面要求作歐洲的決戰，據某專門家所見，英美關於侵略巴爾幹的軍事準備，在西四里之前。然而西四里却先發動，這是因為英美蘇三國對巴爾幹的互爭勢力尙未解決的緣故。這關係可以很淸楚地見到三國的巴爾幹工作。</p>
<p>英美的政策，擬結連保加利亞，希臘，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞結成反共聯盟，並拉　土耳其加入茶於蘇聯的政策，則擬　出羅馬尼亞，控制多瑙河口，並籠絡保加利亞，南斯拉夫民族在其勢力下，以愛獲得從黑海西海岸到期琴海向亞得里亞海的通路。這政策當然與土耳其的靼韃尼爾海峽相衡突，這便是土耳其與英美的巴爾幹政策合流，對蘇聯的威會要求保障的理由。據確實消息，蘇聯駐保國公使拉維里秀齊夫氏，在與保國當局的會談中，告訴英矣方面的上　企圖說：「蘇聯決計阻止英美在巴爾幹進出。希望保國不必有何顧處，與蘇聯協力抵抗英美。」這說明了蘇聯對於恐懼英美在巴爾幹登陸的保　，給予口頭上的保證，使勿轉向英美方面，背後含蘊着反德同時又反英美的企圖。隨着英美的巴爾幹登陸準備的進展，蘇聯自身也在高加索海岸地方獨是進行巴爾幹登陸準備。這是蘇聯對英美對立的又一證明。塞爾維亞，克羅地，蒙的納　羅等亞得里亞海沿岸的反軸心勞力，一種是共產黨關係，一種是親英關係，二種勞力亙相對立，又是一個例證。在希臘也有同樣的傾向。在羅馬尼亞，反軸心分子之間，追　英美的傾向，較為得勢。</p>
<p>此次的羅邱會談，關於巴爾幹間題，是否能解決這幾點，頗為疑問，總而言之，羅　的計劃，擬利用蘇聯的食糧困難，使蘇聯承認巴爾幹第二戰綫，以為加强食糧補充的交換條件，甚至於讓步到容許蘇聯參加巴爾幹占領地的行政，確定勞力範圍，以　獲得蘇聯的諒解。</p>
<p>第三條問題</p>
<p>至於第三個問題，敵方對愛琴海及亞得里亞海的攻撃企圖及德軍的對策如何？以西浦洛斯島為根據地的英美反攻準備最近在進展中。英美的巴爾幹侵略戰，不能看作是英美對蘇聯成立巴爾幹協定的結果，毋寗看作是在英美與蘇聯不能成立諒解的塲合，强行在巴爾幹登陸，對蘇造成既成事實。</p>
<p>在他方而，我們又可以作這樣看法：英美方面斷定蘇聯的抗戰力已漸達尾聲，因此，急於在巴爾幹動手對反攻所造成的結果，蘇聯雖不願意，也不能小依附於英美的巴爾幹政策之下了。</p>
<p>對於這種情勢，德國的巴爾幹防禦正順利地進展中，德國在巴爾幹的軍事地位，從指揮系統的統一，後方的整備，陣地的强化，及兵器等看來，比以前更見强固。對英美的登陸企圖，已形成了固若金漡的防綫了。（翔：　自入月卞八日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c3">汪主席昨日巡視鎭江區淸鄉情形　民衆夾道歡呼情緒極為熱烈 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　宜傳部於八月廿九日上午十一時發表公報如下：</p>
<p>國民政府注主席為巡視鎮扛淸鄉地區情形，於本月廿八日晨由京啓節赴鎮，問日晚　抵首都，隨節者有行政院秘　長陳春團，海軍部長任援道，建設部長陳君懸，軍委會委員陳昌服，淸鄉事務局r注曼雲，外交部次長周隆庠，宜傳部次長郭秀峯，行政院秘　陳團琦，暨柴山中將寺　少將等</p>

<p>民衆舉行歡迎大會</p>
<p>下午二時主席親自出　鎮扛各界民衆歡迎大會，並檢閱自衛團，會塲在　軍大操塲廣地，佈置極為壯觀，全體民衆排列恭候，不下數萬人。主席入塲後，全體民衆致最敬禮，並由鎮江，丹陽，武進，無錫，揚中各縣代表獻詞，主席勗勉有加。繼即檢閱鎮江自　團，全體團員精神奮發，隊伍經主席台前，均正步行注目禮，主席舉手答禮，大檢閱完畢後，即席訓話，全體民衆極為感動。末中司儀領導高呼擁護最高領袖汪全席口號。主席即在軍樂與歡呼交　聲中，乘車赴海軍碼頭，乘輸赴鎮江名勝焦山遊覽。</p>

<p>主席及中日各　官，與李省長　主任等抵達海軍碼頭後，即分乘海　砲艇五艘、在長扛碧波中直駛焦山。焦山在長江中心，為天然要塹，形　險要。主席登岸後，全體僧衆合十致敬歡迎，全席逕登華嚴閣休憇。旋在華嚴閣前與任海長等視察　江形勢，極形愉快。略事休憇，在華嚴閣公宴中甘各長官。席間由主席致詞。繼主柴山中將致　，並視主席健康，及中國國運昌隆。全體復舉杯向主席致敬。時音樂悠揚，烏扛晚風輕拂，全塲空氣極為歡洽。至六時　，全體，暮色蒼茫巾，乘原艇返抵鎮江後，主席駕返首都，全鎮民衆夾道歡送，李省　　主任等率領全體人昌赴東站恭送，全席祚軍樂悠揚擊中　鎮云。</p>
<p>主席答各報記者問</p>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　京滬各報以主席蒞鎮巡視淸鄉，均特派記者赴鎮　訪消息，蒙主席賜予接見，記者方面特提出參戰與淸鄉工作及收囘和界後國府經濟政策，與濟鄉地區之關係　問題，承主席懇切賜答如左：</p>
<p>關於第一問題主席答謂：去年七月一淸鄉一週年紀念時，我會說過，從前淸鄉H作，其目的在求實現全面和平，現在淸鄉工作，其目的却在協力大東亞戰爭、因為在大東亞戰爭中，中國地處後方，應該步步替前方第一綫友邦將士　想，淸鄉有兩大目標，一是確立治安，一是增加生產。前者是使前方將士無後顧之憂後者是使人民在鄉村增進農業生產，在都市　進輕工業生產，以其所得，貢獻於大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>關於第二問題主席答謂：此次中國收囘上海公共租界及法租界，全仗友邦盛意援助，我們不僅表示感謝，尤其要深切反省，友邦深知中團必須完成獨立，才有力量貢獻於大東亞戰爭，交還租界，就是友邦援助巾國完成獨立的事實表示，上海舊租界興內地向來有一個很大的懸　，例如過去內地發生戰亂的時候，租界反呈繁榮可見得租界和內她情形完全相反，拿食米和棉花來說，產來的是　鄉地區，而食米的是上海五百萬市民，　棉的是淸鄉地區農民，而紡紗織布的是上海工廠。紗布在今年一月的公定價，廿支紗每包為五千八百元，可是上海黑市價格寬　四萬元之鉅。種棉的農人辛辛苦苦種了棉花，無力買布，種稻的農民，辛辛苦苦收了殺春了米，換了錢，也無力買布。這都可證明上海　租界和內地的分隔。今租界既已收囘，政府當積極推行統一的經濟政策，在統一的經濟政策下，使上海與淸鄉區同甘共苦，同生共死。淸鄉地區有的是農業，上海有的是工業，重工業現在雖談不到，輕工業很可發達，自當通盤計劃，發達淸鄉地區的農業，配合上　輕工業的發展。農業是淸鄉區要努力的，工業是上海要努力的。我深信租界收囘之後，統一的經濟政策，必能順利推行。此次政府收買棉紗布，我曾到上海兩次、召集工商各界，對收買意義予以說明，並獲各界的贊助，所以能順利進行，要之，中國今日一切問題，均集中在如何協力大東亞戰爭，無論上海市民或請淸鄉地區人民，或共他各地人民，我們常對他們說，除大東亞戰爭勝　以外，中國沒有第二條圖存之路，中國應把一切精神力物質力都集中於這一點。</p>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　汪主席於廿八日早午九時由京啓節赴鎭江淸淸鄉區巡視，廿八日下午九時三十分返京，政府各院部會長官多在車站恭迎，主席即車乘車返官邸。</p>
<h3 id="c4">石渡顧問談「參戰中國」 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　國府經濟最高顧問石渡氏，於日本實施對華新政策後為與日政府商討具體施策，於日前抵此，茲公務已畢，於二十九日自東京車站出發，就　歸任，於出發前談，一參戰中國」大意如次，大東亞戰爭爆發後，中國民衆即已看破渝方無　之抗戰，不過為蔣介石與其黨羽買辦，財閥等勾結欲將中國乃至大東亞出買於英美之陰謀，故民心均歸於國府，而中國之對日信心，由同甘共苦進而至同生共死。中國殺然對英美宣戰，此即為民心動向之表白，日本以此為契機，對國府交還租界徹廢治外法權實施對華新政策，協助中國完成自主，協力國府强化政治經濟力凡此種種，使中國民衆愈益認識大東亞戰之意義，國民對汪主席建國精進之真髓，亦無不精誠服　，中國民衆所感得者，早已超過想像之上。汪主席於接收上海租界之後，曾即於上海發表要請國民統一思想以產業基地之責任與日本共同完遂大東亞戰爭，並宜明國府今後之方略與決意闡述中國人民決與日本立於共同戰綫，對迷夢未醒者不惜予以誅滅，同時並積極安定民生。增强生產，以達成大東亞戰爭產業基地之中國至上使命，不久並斷然實行統制收買上海棉紗棉布政策，由於國政之强力，推行及日方之絕對支援，故棉紗棉布之收買狀况，極為順利，實施以來，華中物價已形低落，對各地輸出物资，亦漸流暢，民生因以安定生產得以增加此對中國途行見參戰使命，裨益匪淺和平地之治安，因淸鄉工作之成功，各地均頗良好，尤以廣東方面因冶安確立之結果，珠江三角洲地帶之豐富米產，已得運往廣東各地，此不但廣東民生得以安定。華北食糧間題之解決得一　大助力。總之現在和平各地區無不充滿光明之希望云云。</p>

<p>上海的經濟文化向來可以影響全國的，可以說上海已經不是上海的上海，而是全中國的上海了，租界收回以後，在建設新中國的遂程上，樹立更良好的基礎。但是百餘年來租界的流毒不易朝夕淸除，諸位都是北方智識界的中堅，希望多多發表建設新上海的意見，來供給我們參考以後我們還要密切聯絡，大家在1個國家一個政　一個領袖之下，團結努力，來實現興復中華保衛東亞的目的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Self-Disturbing Fool <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai, due to its diverse population from all directions, has always been a "breeding ground" for rumors, given the exceptionally complex social situation. It tends to systematically fabricate various rumors in accordance with the evolution of international and domestic affairs, even "creating waves out of thin air," so that a small number of speculators and adventurers can take the opportunity to "fish in troubled waters." In the past, all sorts of market disturbances were initiated by the rumors fabricated by Europeans, Americans, and a portion of local speculators and adventurers. Naturally, our country is the one harmed by these, especially the vast majority of city residents, who are deceived by the rumors and act rashly, becoming self-disturbing fools. As a result, countless individuals have gone bankrupt. Although the Shanghai concessions have now been returned, the deeply ingrained germs of a century and the complex social content of Shanghai make it difficult to fundamentally eradicate the source of rumors. Moreover, we are now in wartime, a period when the world war has entered its decisive stage, and the enemy is still making every effort to infiltrate the rear and carry out various disruptive conspiracies.</p>
<p>Today, those who attempt to take advantage of Shanghai's past special nature and social complexity to create various rumors at any time are naturally international spies and the covert activities of British and American agents. The second are Chongqing elements stirring up trouble and calling a stag a horse. The third are the general speculative merchants in this city, who pursue their own private interests and personal wealth. Their only capital, it could be said, is the skill of "spreading rumors." They rely on spreading rumors to disrupt the market and take the opportunity to carry out disguised robbery.</p>
<p>Whether it's British and American spies, Chongqing elements, or speculators, rumors are ultimately just rumors. Rumors can never be compared with facts. The reason rumors can play a role lies not in the rumors or the rumor-mongers themselves, but in the attitude of the citizens towards rumors. If everyone can recognize that rumors are just rumors and remain unmoved, then no rumor will affect the market, and the rumor-mongers will be defeated without a fight and their schemes will fail.</p>
<p>Recently, various rumors have surfaced intermittently in the market. These rumors strive to connect with the international situation and the government. For those with clear eyes, they can naturally dismiss the rumors as soon as they hear them, but the general public, ignorant of the situation, often becomes suspicious and falls into the trap of rumor-mongers. In fact, from the current international situation, the stability of the East Asian situation, whether militarily or politically, has already been established on an unshakeable foundation. Not only will the "counteroffensive" of Britain and the United States not succeed, but also any evolution of the European war cannot affect East Asia. On the contrary, now in the world, no matter which aspect, it is impossible not to require the cooperation of East Asia. The Soviet Union has always maintained neutrality towards Japan and refused to participate in the Quebec Conference, which can be seen as a negative proof of the stability of the East Asian situation.</p>
<p>All the facts in East Asia and China demonstrate that any rumors in the market are ultimately rumors without any factual basis. We have an old saying, "Rumors stop with the wise." Today, we hope that everyone will use their reason, recognize the reality, and not be self-disturbing fools.

<h3 id="e2">Britain, America, and the Soviet Union Contend Overtly and Covertly in the Balkans <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Balkans, due to their geographical location, are extremely important in the current stage of the war. The three points that attract the most attention are as follows:</p>
<p>The defense and offense of the Romanian oil fields.</p>
<p>The political relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria and Serbia. The enemy's offensive attempts on the Aegean and Adriatic Seas.</p>
<p>The first question</p>
<p>First, the Romanian oil fields centered on Ploiești produce 7 million tons of crude oil annually. According to British and American calculations, if they are completely destroyed, Germany's war power will be reduced by 50%. Therefore, Britain and the United States believe that attacking the oil fields is more important than the Eastern European front. Britain and the United States have been preparing heavily in this regard for several months, expanding air force bases in Syria and Palestine. Finally, on the 1st of last month, they launched the first air raid with a large formation of 200 aircraft (according to British announcements).</p>
<p>The second question</p>
<p>As for the second question, it is one of the main points of the Moscow Conference. In the midst of the Soviet Union's demand for a second front, the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans is easy to imagine. On the Soviet side, opening a second front is naturally desirable, but on the British and American side, they advocate destroying Germany's fuel supply bases and warehouses in addition to bombing northwestern Germany, demanding a decisive battle in Europe in the Balkans. According to a certain expert, the British and American military preparations for invading the Balkans were underway four weeks ago. However, Sicily was launched first. This is because the mutual power struggles of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union in the Balkans have not yet been resolved. This relationship can clearly show the three countries' Balkan work.</p>
<p>The British and American policy is to unite Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania to form an anti-communist alliance, and to drag Turkey into it. The Soviet Union's policy is to carve out Romania, control the mouth of the Danube, and win over the Bulgarian and Yugoslav nations under its influence, in order to obtain a passage from the west coast of the Black Sea to the Adriatic Sea via the Aegean Sea. This policy naturally conflicts with Turkey's Dardanelles Strait, which is why Turkey's Balkan policy converges with that of Britain and the United States, demanding guarantees against the Soviet Union's threats. According to reliable sources, Soviet Minister to Bulgaria, Lavrishchev, told the Bulgarian authorities in talks about the British and American attempts, saying: "The Soviet Union is determined to prevent Britain and the United States from entering and exiting the Balkans. It hopes that Bulgaria will not have any concerns and will cooperate with the Soviet Union to resist Britain and the United States." This shows that the Soviet Union is giving verbal guarantees to the pro-British and pro-American Bulgarians who fear the landing of Britain and the United States in the Balkans, so as not to turn to the British and American side, while implying an attempt to oppose both Germany and Britain and the United States. With the progress of British and American preparations for landing in the Balkans, the Soviet Union itself is also independently conducting preparations for landing in the Balkans in the Caucasus coastal area. This is another proof of the Soviet Union's opposition to Britain and the United States. The anti-Axis forces along the Adriatic coast, such as Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro, one is related to the Communist Party, and the other is pro-British, and the two forces are mutually opposed, which is another example. There is also a similar tendency in Greece. In Romania, the tendency to pursue Britain and the United States among the anti-Axis elements is more dominant.</p>
<p>It is quite doubtful whether the current Moscow Conference can resolve these issues regarding the Balkans. In short, the British and American plan is to take advantage of the Soviet Union's food difficulties to make the Soviet Union recognize the second front in the Balkans as an exchange condition for strengthening food supplies, even to the point of allowing the Soviet Union to participate in the administration of the Balkan occupied territories, determining the scope of labor, in order to gain the Soviet Union's understanding.</p>
<p>The third question</p>
<p>As for the third question, what are the enemy's offensive attempts on the Aegean and Adriatic Seas and the German countermeasures? The British and American counteroffensive preparations based on the island of Cyprus are currently progressing. The British and American invasion of the Balkans cannot be seen as the result of Britain and the United States reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on the Balkans, but rather as a situation where Britain and the United States cannot reach an understanding with the Soviet Union and forcibly land in the Balkans, creating a fait accompli for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can also view it this way: The British and American side has determined that the Soviet Union's resistance is gradually coming to an end, and therefore, they are anxious to act in the Balkans. As a result of the counteroffensive, even if the Soviet Union is unwilling, it cannot but rely on the British and American Balkan policy.</p>
<p>In response to this situation, Germany's defense of the Balkans is progressing smoothly. Germany's military position in the Balkans, from the unification of the command system, the preparation of the rear, the strengthening of the positions, and weapons, is stronger than before. A strong defense line has been formed against the British and American landing attempts. (翔: From the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, August 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Chairman Wang Yesterday Inspected the Situation of Clearing the Countryside in Zhenjiang Area The People Cheered Along the Road with Extremely Enthusiastic Emotions <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram The Propaganda Department issued the following communique at 11:00 AM on August 29th:</p>
<p>Chairman Wang of the National Government, in order to inspect the situation of clearing the countryside in the Zhenjiang area, departed from Nanjing to Zhenjiang on the morning of the 28th of this month and returned to the capital on the evening of the same day.

<p>(Central News Agency News) Chairman Wang, along with his entourage, arrived in the Zhenjiang Rural Clearing area on a special train from the capital on the 28th to inspect. Governor Li also arrived in Zhenjiang at the same time, and Director Yuan, Deputy Director Zhang, and all the chiefs of the special districts and representatives of the people were all present at the station to welcome him respectfully. The chairman arrived at the station amidst the melodious music of the provincial government band. The chairman was wearing an army general's uniform, looking heroic and refreshed. After getting off the train, all the personnel gave their utmost respect, and the chairman smiled and frequently returned the salute. Then, he took a special car to inspect the city. The people of Zhenjiang were extremely excited to hear that the chairman was visiting Zhenjiang for inspection. The streets were full of pine and cypress arches and banners proclaiming support for the supreme leader. Wherever he went, Chinese and Japanese residents alike cheered along the road, their voices resounding like thunder, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. Then, he went to the Rural Clearing Director's Office to listen to Director Yuan's report and gave a speech to all the staff in the auditorium, with many words of encouragement. Then, he returned to Yuntaishan for rest. At noon, Governor Li hosted a banquet for Chairman Wang and all the personnel at the Japan-China Club.</p>
<p>People Hold a Grand Welcome Rally</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the Chairman personally attended the Zhenjiang All-Circles People's Welcome Rally and reviewed the Self-Defense Corps. The rally venue was the large military parade ground, which was decorated extremely grandly. All the people were lined up waiting respectfully, numbering no less than tens of thousands. After the Chairman entered the venue, all the people gave their utmost respect, and representatives from Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, and Yangzhong counties gave speeches, which the Chairman greatly encouraged. Then, he reviewed the Zhenjiang Self-Defense Corps. All the members of the corps were spirited and marched past the chairman's platform in formation, paying attention. The Chairman raised his hand to return the salute. After the grand review was completed, he gave an impromptu speech, which greatly moved all the people. Finally, the master of ceremonies led the crowd in shouting slogans supporting the supreme leader Chairman Wang. The Chairman then boarded a car and went to the naval dock amidst the music and cheers to take a boat to visit Jiaoshan, a scenic spot in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Chairman Visits Jiaoshan Scenic Spot</p>
<p>After the Chairman and various Chinese and Japanese officials, along with Governor Li and Director Yuan, arrived at the naval dock, they boarded five naval gunboats and sailed straight to Jiaoshan in the blue waves of the Yangtze River. Jiaoshan is located in the center of the Yangtze River and is a natural fortress, with a dangerous terrain. After the Chairman landed, all the monks greeted him with their palms together to welcome him. The Chairman went straight to Huayan Pavilion for a rest. Then, in front of Huayan Pavilion, he inspected the situation of the Yangtze River with Naval Minister Ren and others, looking extremely pleased. After a short rest, a public banquet was held in Huayan Pavilion to entertain the various officials. During the banquet, the Chairman delivered a speech. Then, Major General Shibayama gave a speech, wishing the Chairman good health and China's national fortune prosperity. Everyone raised their glasses to salute the Chairman. At that time, the music was melodious, and the evening breeze of the Yangtze River gently caressed, and the atmosphere of the whole venue was extremely harmonious. At 6:00 PM, everyone boarded the original boats in the dim twilight and returned to Zhenjiang. The people of the town cheered along the road to send him off. Governor Li and Director Yuan led all the people to the East Station to respectfully send him off. The Chairman left Zhenjiang amidst the melodious military music.</p>
<p>Chairman Answers Questions from Reporters</p>
<p>Nanjing, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram All the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai specially sent reporters to Zhenjiang to inquire about news of the Chairman's visit to inspect rural clearing. The Chairman graciously granted them an audience, and the reporters specifically raised questions about participation in the war and rural clearing work, the relationship between the national government's economic policies after the recovery of the concessions and the rural clearing areas. The Chairman gave sincere answers as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, the Chairman replied: Last year, during the first anniversary of the Rural Clearing, I said that the purpose of the previous Rural Clearing work was to seek the realization of overall peace, but now the purpose of the Rural Clearing work is to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Because China is located in the rear in the Greater East Asia War, it should think for the Allied soldiers on the front line step by step. Rural Clearing has two major goals: one is to establish security, and the other is to increase production. The former is to make the soldiers on the front line have no worries about the rear, and the latter is to enable the people to increase agricultural production in the countryside and increase light industrial production in the cities, and contribute their income to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, the Chairman replied: This time China recovered the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, all thanks to the Allied powers' generous assistance. We not only express our gratitude, but also deeply reflect. The Allied powers know that China must complete its independence in order to have the strength to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Returning the concessions is a factual expression of the Allied powers' assistance to China in completing its independence. The old Shanghai concessions and the mainland have always had a very large gap. For example, in the past, when war broke out in the mainland, the concessions were prosperous. It can be seen that the situation in the concessions and the mainland was completely opposite. Taking rice and cotton as examples, those that are produced are the rural areas, and those that eat rice are the 5 million citizens of Shanghai. Those that plant cotton are the farmers in the rural clearing areas, and those that spin yarn and weave cloth are the Shanghai factories. The official price of cotton cloth in January this year was 5,800 yuan per package of 20 count yarn, but the black market price in Shanghai was as high as 40,000 yuan. The cotton farmers worked hard to plant cotton but could not afford to buy cloth, and the rice farmers worked hard to harvest rice but could not afford to buy cloth. All of this proves the separation between the Shanghai concessions and the mainland. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the government should actively promote a unified economic policy. Under a unified economic policy, Shanghai and the rural clearing areas will share weal and woe, and live and die together. The rural clearing areas have agriculture, and Shanghai has industry. Heavy industry cannot be discussed now, but light industry can be very developed. We should make overall plans to develop the agriculture of the rural clearing areas and cooperate with the development of light industry in Shanghai. Agriculture is what the rural clearing areas should strive for, and industry is what Shanghai should strive for. I firmly believe that after the concessions are recovered, a unified economic policy will be successfully promoted. This time, the government purchased cotton yarn and cloth. I went to Shanghai twice to convene various industrial and commercial circles to explain the significance of the purchase and obtained the support of all circles, so it could be carried out smoothly. In short, all of China's problems today are concentrated on how to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Whether it is the citizens of Shanghai or the people of the rural clearing areas, or the people of other places, we often say to them that apart from victory in the Greater East Asia War, China has no second way to survive. China should concentrate all its spiritual and material strength on this point.</p>
<p>Nanjing, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram Chairman Wang departed from Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 28th to inspect the rural clearing area in Zhenjiang. He returned to Nanjing at 9:30 PM on the 28th. Many officials from the government's various ministries and commissions respectfully welcomed him at the station. The Chairman then boarded a car and returned to his official residence.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Advisor Ishiwatari Discusses "Participating in the War China" <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, August 29th, Central News Agency Telegram Mr. Ishiwatari, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, arrived here a few days ago to discuss specific measures with the Japanese government after Japan implemented its new policy towards China. Now that his official duties have been completed, he departed from Tokyo Station on the 29th to return to his post. Before his departure, he discussed "Participating in the War China" in general as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese people had already seen through the Chongqing side's futile resistance, which was nothing but a conspiracy by Chiang Kai-shek and his party members, compradors, and financial magnates to sell China and even Greater East Asia to Britain and the United States. Therefore, the hearts of the people all turned to the National Government, and China's trust in Japan progressed from sharing weal and woe to living and dying together. China suddenly declared war on Britain and the United States, which was a manifestation of the people's will. Taking this as an opportunity, Japan returned the concessions, completely abolished extraterritorial rights, implemented a new policy towards China, assisted China in completing its autonomy, and cooperated with the National Government to strengthen its political and economic power. All of these things made the Chinese people increasingly recognize the significance of the Greater East Asia War, and the people were all sincerely convinced of the essence of Chairman Wang's nation-building efforts. What the Chinese people felt had already exceeded imagination. After receiving the Shanghai concessions, Chairman Wang immediately issued a statement in Shanghai calling on the people to unify their thinking, take on the responsibility of the industrial base, and complete the Greater East Asia War together with Japan, and clearly stated the National Government's future policies and determination to explain that the Chinese people were determined to stand on a common front with Japan, and would not hesitate to annihilate those who had not awakened from their dreams, while actively stabilizing the people's livelihood and increasing production to achieve the supreme mission of China as the industrial base of the Greater East Asia War. Soon after, he resolutely implemented a policy of unified control and purchase of Shanghai cotton yarn and cloth. Due to the strong promotion of the national policy and the absolute support of the Japanese side, the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth was extremely smooth. Since its implementation, prices in Central China have fallen, and the export of materials to various places has gradually become smoother, so the people's livelihood has been stabilized and production has been increased, which is of great benefit to China's path of participating in the war. The security of peaceful areas is quite good due to the success of the rural clearing work, especially in Guangdong, as a result of the establishment of security, the abundant rice production in the Pearl River Delta area has been transported to various parts of Guangdong, which has not only stabilized the people's livelihood in Guangdong, but also provided great assistance in solving the food problem in North China. In short, all peaceful areas are now full of bright hope, etc.</p>

Director Liang delivered a speech, followed by a response from Cai Tian, the head of the reporters' group, summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Director Liang's Speech</p>
<p>Distinguished journalists from North China: Today, Mayor Chen is unable to attend the banquet due to other matters, so I am representing the Shanghai Municipal Government to host you. Your visit from afar allows us to feel a profound sense of kinship and comradeship, and we extend a most sincere welcome.</p>
<p>Shanghai's economy and culture have always been able to influence the entire country. It can be said that Shanghai is no longer Shanghai's Shanghai, but the Shanghai of all of China. After the recovery of the concessions, we are establishing an even better foundation in the process of building a new China. However, the poison of the concessions over the past hundred years will not be easily eradicated overnight. You are all the backbone of the intellectual community in the North, and we hope that you will provide us with more opinions on building the new Shanghai for our reference. In the future, we will need to maintain close contact, uniting and working hard under one country, one government, and one leader to achieve the goal of restoring China and defending East Asia.</p>
<p>Group Leader's Response</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the Propaganda Department of the National Government, we have come to Nanjing and Shanghai for study. Our itinerary in Nanjing and Suzhou has been successfully completed. Last night, we arrived in Shanghai, where we were warmly greeted by Commissioner Fang of the Propaganda Department and President Xu and Vice President Yan of the China Daily News, among others. My colleagues and I feel exceedingly honored. Today, we are also honored to be treated to a grand banquet by Mayor Chen, who offered earnest encouragement. I extend my deepest gratitude on behalf of the entire delegation.</p>
<p>The purpose of our visit can be divided into two points: First, to report to the 100 million compatriots in North China on the new political facilities implemented in the three years since the National Government's return to the capital. Second, to bring the authenticity of the new Shanghai, based on what we have seen and heard, to North China and provide a thorough introduction to all levels of society. As for the first point, the new political situation implemented in the three years since the National Government's return to the capital naturally includes many departments. Since the authorities and our colleagues have provided us with as much convenience as possible, I believe that we will not fail in our mission. As for the second point, the so-called new Shanghai, our friendly nation Japan, based on morality, has removed all specialized concessions in China and returned them to our country unconditionally, opening a new chapter for the return of concessions. This bright and shining act of returning the Shanghai International Settlement to its rightful owner has been celebrated by 100 million compatriots in North China for weeks. Therefore, there are many people who want to know about our country's construction plans and the reality of Shanghai after the return of the concessions. For this reason, the significance of our visit is very different from that of ordinary tourism.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I, in addition to expressing our respect to Mayor Chen and other officials, raise our glasses and wish Mayor Chen and Director Liang good health, and sincerely express our determination to fight forever to all of our colleagues present.</p>
<p>Visiting Film Production</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the North China Journalists Delegation, accompanied by personnel from the Municipal Propaganda Department, went to the Second Production Studio of China Thunder Film Company on Fulili Road, where they were warmly greeted by Zhang Pukun, the company's deputy general manager, Tian Shi, the general affairs manager, and Ma Zongyi, the director of the Propaganda Department. They visited the filming of "Begonia," and then visited the Fourth Studio in Xujiahui to view the filming of "Swallows Welcoming Spring." They then went to the First Studio on Haig Road to view the outdoor scenes of "Thousands of Miles of Mourning." At about 7:00 PM, the company hosted a banquet at the Kangle Restaurant, attended by the company's general manager, He Jie, deputy general manager, Zhang Shankun, directors Fang Peilin, Wang Yin, Yue Feng, and all thirty-plus members of the journalists delegation. The conversation was lively and enjoyable. At 9:00 PM, the company treated them to a showing of the film "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds" at the Cathay Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Public Banquet by the Press</p>
<p>The Shanghai Press Federation, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Telegraph Agency, the Shanghai Japanese Journalists Club, and the Shanghai Journalists Association, in order to fulfill their duty as hosts, have specially scheduled a banquet at the Wanzhao Hotel at noon tomorrow (the 31st) to welcome the North China Journalists Delegation, and have invited senior officials from Chinese and Japanese propaganda organizations to attend. The gathering of journalists from the North and South at that time is sure to be unprecedented.</p>

<p>The National Business Unification Association Notifies Businesses to Comply</p>
<p>The National Business Unification Association was ordered by the Executive Yuan to handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the Shanghai area within a specified period of 15 days (from August 23rd to September 6th). This has been published in the newspapers, notifying all merchants to comply. The person in charge of the Business Unification Association has indicated that once this period is set, it will not be extended. Fearing that some ignorant merchants may have hopes for an extension, resulting in penalties for delay, the Association, as a collective of businesses, cannot but sincerely inform them. It is hoped that all businesses will apply within the deadline. If there are any cases of concealment or delay, and they are discovered by the inspection authorities designated by the Executive Yuan, they will be punished according to the law, causing unnecessary suffering. The above matters have been communicated by the Association in a letter to the United Association of Cotton Products Industry for forwarding to all associations, notifying all businesses and all cloth holders to be aware and to apply to the cotton yarn and cotton cloth purchasing office within the specified period.</p>

<p>Due to the famine in North China this spring, this newspaper called on all sectors to donate funds. Since May 17th, we have been collecting donations and subsequently held the Shen Bao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament and a Charity Art Exhibition. The donations received have been deposited into a bank designated by the Relief Association and published from time to time to ensure credibility. Now, the donations from various sectors and the proceeds from the charity sale of books and paintings last month, totaling 5,900 yuan in savings certificates, have been sent to Tongrun Qianzhuang for collection (receipt number 1116). All disaster relief work in North China handled by this newspaper has now concluded. If various sectors wish to donate in the future, please send them directly to the bank designated by the Relief Association for collection, in accordance with the regulations. Furthermore, all expenses incurred by this newspaper in handling this disaster relief effort have been borne by this newspaper itself. This is hereby stated for public knowledge.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of cigarette rationing by the Central China Tobacco Distribution Cooperative in this city, all retailers have been able to sell at the prescribed price. However, cigarette scalpers are quite active, setting up stalls along the roads to sell cigarettes at prices several times higher than the prescribed price, which is illegal. Therefore, the police authorities have decided to crack down on this and prohibit setting up stalls. However, an investigation into the source of these stall cigarettes reveals that, in addition to scalpers buying and reselling, some retailers are also privately raising the price of rationed cigarettes. The police authorities have been conducting a thorough investigation, and once verified, they will be severely punished. The public is also encouraged to report truthfully to comply with the law and stabilize prices.</p>

<p>According to a responsible person from the Shanghai Tram Company, in order to prevent ticket sellers from committing fraud, the tram company has hired undercover fare inspectors since July 10th (all wearing armbands) to conduct inspections when the ticket sellers are not paying attention. It is said that these undercover inspectors, in addition to investigating ticket sellers for fraud, also prevent some passengers from taking advantage of their positions related to the officialdom to ride for free.</p>

<p>Entrusted to Ben Gu Company for Distribution</p>
<p>In order to supplement the food supply for the residents of this city, the military distribution cooperative has successively purchased large quantities of soybeans and yellow beans to Shanghai for distribution at low prices. Recently, large quantities of cowpeas and mung beans have arrived in Shanghai. These beans can be ground into flour and mixed into rice or porridge as a substitute for hunger. Furthermore, due to the current high price of grain, in order to regulate the people's food supply, these beans will be sold at low prices. Cowpeas are sold at 410 yuan per picul (100 catties) in Central Reserve Certificates (including the bag), and mung beans are sold at 610 yuan per picul (100 catties) in Central Reserve Certificates (including the bag). Ben Gu Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Company has been entrusted to handle the distribution. Those who wish to purchase can bring their seal to the company to place an order and pay, and then pick up the goods.</p>

<p>A Serious Problem</p>
<p>What kind of magical power do the nuns of Notre Dame possess to found and support such a difficult undertaking? Apart from a pure heart of faith and zeal for preaching, the nuns have nothing else. They have no backing, do not promote themselves, do not engage in social activities, and refuse any praise from the secular world. They rely on the cooperation of Catholics all over the world. They never solicit donations in Shanghai or anywhere in China. Moreover, in the past, their expenses were small, and the nuns were frugal, yet the cause flourished. However, since the outbreak of the war, the situation has completely changed. The sources of donations from abroad and from various foreign firms in this city have been cut off, but the rising prices have caused their expenses to expand continuously. In various primary and secondary schools, there are many free or half-price students, and it is already very difficult to barely maintain operations. Other purely social relief undertakings are in danger of collapsing due to economic difficulties. The most serious of these is the food problem. Taking only the Notre Dame orphanage and educational institution as an example, they need at least 4,000 catties of rice per month. The amount provided by the household registration is naturally far from sufficient. The Renshan Yuyingtang orphanage in the city needs at least five bags of rice per month and is now almost relying on borrowing rice to get by each day. The porridge, rice, and bread needed to feed the poor at the entrance of Notre Dame cost at least 100 yuan per day. The second problem is the difficulty of obtaining medicine. The medical and pharmaceutical services they provide are extensive and involve many units. Sun Mumu, of the Renci Clinic on Datong Road, said: "We need at least 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per month for medicine. Last month, we spent 900 yuan on scabies medicine alone. And the scattered consumption of injections, medicinal alcohol, ointments, adhesive plasters, cotton, gauze, etc., adds up to a considerable sum each day. The price of medicine continues to skyrocket, and they are unable to afford essential items such as glycerin, Vaseline, sulfur powder, and medicinal alcohol. It is questionable whether they will be able to continue providing medical and pharmaceutical services in the future. In addition, they are experiencing difficulties in almost every aspect of education, relief, and other expenses. They have applied to the Shanghai Municipal Poor and Sick Relief Association for assistance. After investigating, Committee Members Yao Equan and Ji Zhendong expressed their satisfaction with the services provided by the hospital and were impressed by the nuns' dedication and spirit of sacrifice. They have provided a total of 50,000 yuan in subsidies, which has helped to alleviate some of the difficulties. However, the soaring prices and increasing expenses are about to crush the nuns. This is a very serious situation! In order to maintain such a perfect undertaking, how can enthusiastic women not find ways to lend them a helping hand? (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e27">Financial and Industrial Market Conditions in Shanghai Last Week Tended Towards Normal Stability <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week tended towards normal stability. The phenomenon of tight capital has been substantially alleviated. After the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth began, the Commodity Price Investigation Committee, in addition to investigating the inventory of major commodities in the market, has further investigated the reasons for the rise in prices of food and cloth, making it impossible for merchants hoarding inventory and manipulating market prices to operate. Therefore, the prices of both commodities and food have declined. Interest rates remained stable last week, and no one changed them. Stock prices fell across the board. The black market initially fell and then rose. Official prices were stable. Silver and money firms accepted discounting as much as possible for legitimate needs, so the capital of legitimate silver and money firms was very flexible. In industry and commerce, the trading of yarn and cloth on the large market was stalled, but the prices in various retail stores have been reduced. The prices of various commodities have stopped rising and turned flat. The black market for food rice has also declined. Most food items are subject to rationing, and the holders of goods want to sell them off, so prices are lower than before. However, there have been instances of quantity reductions or delayed distribution of rationed rice, oil, and sugar. People from a living perspective feel uneasy. Factories in various industries that have sufficient raw materials have been adding shifts to resume production, while a considerable number of factories that lack raw materials have stopped production.</p>
