<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>昇官發財</h3>
<p>— 吉田東佑</p>
<p>一九一二年二月十四日，孫總理辭去臨時大總統。翌日，袁世凱經孫先生的薦舉，而就任大總統。我認為這在孫先生是最可惜的一件事。簡言之，這是由於政府經費無着。孫先生認為無論如何要保持南方，所以向日本提出借款。然而這一問題始終沒有進展。後凍參議院決議移讓政權於袁世凱，於是借款問題己成為明日黃花。正當此時，孫文所拜托籌款的三井洋行董事藤瀨正次郎，弄到三十萬日元。便報告孫先生說：「根據您所指示的，我到處奔走，但無論如何也都未能如願籌足款項，而終於費了九牛二虎之力，才東湊西借弄成這個數目，請使用吧！」孫先生對於這一點，馬上說：」謝謝您這種盛情美意，但我不用了。「就這樣謝絕了。藤瀨以為孫先生覺得款項太少，而設出這樣憤慨話，覺得」耗費這許多苦心，籌晝來的錢，竟沒有用」。於是怏怏而退。然而後來藤瀨聽到，當他帶錢去的時候，是參議院業巳決議把孫文先生趕走以後的事，便覺得很難過，如能提早二三天把這筆款子交到孫先生的手或許還可設法罷。於是再度拜訪孫先生，說「聽說先生不幸下野，這樣也一定需要錢的，就請您接受這筆錢吧！」孫文先生回答說：」「前些日子因為我沒有必要再用錢，所以就對您：口謝絕了。我決定把一切政權交與北方，如要維持政權經營國家，當然需要這筆錢，但事到如今，切都不必要了，所以才謝絕。——那末再說現在，雖然您說把這筆錢可以供我私用，但我借了後是償還無望的，所以只好領受您的盛情美意，然而錢，還是請原封帶回」。藤瀨說：「今後也許對閣下有許多波折，如果您沒有這樣數目的款項，也許保持不住前任大總統的體面。如南方政府未移交前得到借款，情形該如何？那樣我就耍求北方袁政府償還……」孫先生聽到此處，態度慢慢地變了，便說：「那絕對不可以，我們為打倒中國的惡劣政府，為淸除腐敗份子而起義的。如聽從您的話，那末民國肇始第一任大總統又繼承了已往的惡例，那絕對不可以」，就這樣聲色俱厲，且莊嚴不可侵犯地謝絕了藤瀨的厚意。藤瀨聽到這樣話後，據說肅然起敬地哭了。（第一革命參加者萱野長知氏談話）</p>
<p>「昇官發財」這句話，已經成為口頭禪。在官吏受錢不覺任何羞恥的社會裹，發見這樣的廉潔，實在是日本人感覺驚訝而興奮的。當時中國的官塲也可以說是那樣這德敗壞，但我們現在也不能不痛心認為，中華民國的官吏，仍舊繼承了淸朝時代那種道德破產現象的大部份。</p>
<p>林語堂在「現實之中國」一文中，會叙述過中國道德的腐敗。如下：</p>
<p>「……北平國立博物館職員（李石會）勾結看管人，盜出博物館珍藏的國隊員，兜售給肯出最高價値者，變換成現金，而放入私囊，且安然無事地大造其住宅，有人向公堂控告時，竟遭拒絕受理審判。還有某將軍（湯玉麟）甚至連虛張聲勢的戰鬥姿態也不表演，竟把熱河省的大好山河讓人佔領，而自己却用二百輛軍用大卡車，把妾勝家產運走，但國民政府竟赦免這類將領之罪行。很多將領一吃敗仗，則棄兵士與彈藥如敝屣，而只是汲汲於搬運他們所貯藏的鴉片。因他們賣掉鴉片，有了本錢還可以買回權力的，爲了維持不支餉銀的烏合之衆的軍隊，便强制農民種鴉片而不種五穀。因此，號稱農業國的中國，每年便不得不從國外輸入價値幾百萬兩白銀的米麥。但處在這樣一切無法無天的狀態中，而直接受其害的國民，却不能對支配者及壓迫者說一「不」字。這一定是國家的某處有毛病。所以國民就不能不喪失其一切道德標準與正邪觀念。」</p>
<p>的確，淸朝變為中華民國，官塲中的腐敗依然如故，「昇官發財」這一名辭還沒有從中國的字典裏刪掉。甚至列舉日本人一切南事的抗戰中國人和英美人，也部承認日本官吏不以貧窮為羞恥。在日本，如官吏或政治家發了財，那就可以構成懷疑該人道德的充分證據。然而在中國，「昇官」同時就是「發財」的意思，所以人人對於這一點並不表示奇怪。據說有僅僅在三四年當中，積成數萬萬家財的高級官員，但沒有人敢追問這樣大的財產是如何稍累成的。國民對於這種現狀，也許委實可以說是「不能不喪失其一切道德標準與正邪觀念」。那末孫文先生的實行革命，豈不是單純把淸朝改稱中華民國國號的革命？絕不是的，正如孫文先生自己所說「是為打倒中國的惡劣政府，為淸除腐收份子而起義的」。中華民國接受日本方面的交還租界，這絕不能算作「中國革命成功」；而孫文先生的運動，是對於社會上所有的對建物（共產黨稱之為封建殘餘，這好像是大部份的封建物業已淸除後的殘剩物，但這決不能表現中國的現狀）作鬥爭。孫先生的革命目的，是中國民主主義的社會革命。而「昇官發財」就是最具體的封建社會之表徵·因此，如不對「昇官發財」作鬥爭，孫文先生的革命，就完全失掉其意義。孫先生關於革命的遺囑，在其言語的眞正意義上，的確是現實中國始終未　的眞理。「昇官發財」這句話，只要在中國的字典裹存在，只要在中國的現實裹存在，那就不能輕描淡寫地說，中國革命成功。</p>

<p>日陸軍省頌授褒狀</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　陸軍省二十八日下午三時發表：守衛阿圖島之山崎部隊及山崎保代陸軍大　殉國後，該方面陸軍最高指揮官曾分別頒給獎狀，刻已奏明天皇陛下。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日本東北方面最高指揮官，七月十四日曾對忠勇守護阿圖島之山崎部隊與山崎部隊長，分別頒與感覺狀感狀如次：山崎部隊先於本川中佐指揮下，鞏固團結，克服所有困苦，孤軍長　守衛阿圖島。昭和十八年四月十七日山崎大佐到任，於其指揮下，惟益　力同心。遂行任務，（中略以上諸隊處此困難之境而堅忍不拔，戰　蓬勃，團結鞏固，抭拒　大之物質威力，發揚至高之忠勇精神，殺敵致果，奪其魂魄，對作戰全局實有至大貢獻，其行動正所謂皇軍之精華武功不折，赫赫超　，茲特授與感狀布告全軍。</p>
<p>作戰經過可歌可泣</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　阿圖島留守軍山崎部隊全體勇士，前於阿圖島牽制美國太平洋艦隊主力與一師團約二萬之大軍，並抵抗敵軍，使敵國國民為之膽寒，終以衆寡不敵，於五月底全體勇士殉國，迄今已歷三閱月，當時之奮戰情形業巳上奏。日陸軍省　發表頒授褒狀及晋級　賞等，茲追誌山崎部隊奮戰情形如次：山崎部隊陸步兵砲兵工兵以外，又包括若干通信隊與衛步隊共隊共二千數百人，由山崎中將（常時為大佐）率領士兵守備阿　島，敵　軍白主年四月　即金圖　囘該島，乃使　空軍基地沿阿留申　島向西推，旋於四月以一大隊兵力在基斯加島西方一百三十公里之阿特蒂加島登陸，趕造飛機塲，一月以後已有能供聯　炸機　用之　備，因此美軍除不斷轟炸其斯加島外，並偵察阿圖島情況。使由巡洋艦驅逐船預作進　阿　島準備，探索日軍　備隊兵力之所在。至五月阿留申羣島即</p>
<p>入於霧季</p>
<p>晴天極少，敵軍乃於五月十五日乘霧以大艦隊，護衛之運　船團駛至阿圖島附近，並由另一部部隊登陸，日守備隊即準備反攻，一俟其駛近即將其　潰，但至十時左右，日監視哨發現大批敵軍開往某方面北部，日軍當即　然開始反擊，力阻敵軍登陸，然敵軍分中北南三路源源在海濱登陸，並知其兵力為數不少，故日守備隊雖竭力反攻，怛敵軍終于下午七時許開　某某角附近，同時在馬加斯加爾灣登陸之敵軍亦噸告接近，其　又有敵軍一部在阿圓　東端薩拉那灣登陸，當被日眾將其　誠。但是時南北岸登陸之敵軍巳開抵北區，故日軍守備隊乃於十二日夜半宵行攻襲在南岸登陸之敵軍，使其向後潰退千公尺或一千五百公尺，企圖在薩拉那灣再行登陸之敵軍亦被殲減，战日軍守備隊巳獲得莫大戰果，至十三日拂曉，敵方以增援部隊，開始活潑行動，其增援部隊源源開向阿加斯加爾灣，有大運輸船團之敵軍，亦使一部兵力在某某灣登陸，恃其裝備之優秀與兵力之雄厚，千是日下午開始向日守軍猛攻，敵巡洋艦復開砲轟擊日軍陣地，日守備隊不僅於全綫抵抗敵軍確保陣地，復於簿　誘敵軍登陸，以山砲將其殲滅，全軍士氣為之大振。是日天氣較睛，然岸上及海上視界僅及三百公尺，故作戰殊感困雖，十四日由某一方而出發之敵艦其裝備優秀，猛攻日軍與守備某山之日軍H兵，同時又由　岸登陸之敵軍兩大隊携砲數門攻　日軍，是日農有小戰艦一艘巡洋艦二艘驅逐艦三艘出現阿圖島　近海面，向各　開砲猛轟　止午復由敵重轟炸機飛往轟炸日軍陣地，炸彈如雨，是日日艦亦毅然出動，</p>
<p>重創敵艦</p>
<p>至十二日敵軍登陸起至十四日止，日軍僅傷亡　十人，十五日日軍仍確保陣地，力阻十倍之敵軍　進，某　灣方面日車曾於十四日　　行夜襲，　亂敵軍陣地，然因敵軍將兵火器逐步增加，致以後戰　漸告困難，該方面日守備隊巳有按一部壯烈犧牲，一方面敵軍進攻馬加斯加爾亦愈趨熾烈，敵軍十五糎砲彈紛紛落於日軍陣　，雙方距離僅一百五十公尺乃至二百公尺，日軍乃於是日午　實行夜龔，經　開肉搏後，使敵軍後退九百餘公尺，然是日因霧較簿，故敵砲擊　為猛烈·是日敵運　船隊人員器材　續運　陸上，敵軍數目約有一師團凡二萬人，均具有特殊備，十六日敵軍使用重火器並裝備器備，由陸海空三方而猛　日軍陣地，致有日軍一小隊全部犧牲，又是日敵運　船亦仍　續登陸。山崎部隊長於　日將存儲某川上流之彈藥糧食等移駐灣口，決心前敵反擊，十六日，半至十七日整日分別移駐齊亞　夫灣口要域，是時日軍船艇全部已被擊沉、海上亦受制壓，敵軍猛擊日軍妨害集中，拂曉　機因誤認目標，竟然肓炸敵軍方而之第一綫，殊屬可笑。日軍守備　雖受敵軍盲射，但仍完成移駐灣口後，乃以伊斯特比克山岳附近之瓜圓陣為前綫，謀加強陣地整備兵力進行某浦地帶者囘作戰，敵軍乃向日軍集中砲擊，十九日敵軍　始向阿圖島登陸之敵作運輸補給，敵軍地上部隊亦不斷攻擊，日軍卒以衆　縣殊之情况下，不得巳向後撤退，山崎部隊長乃令　部準備撤退至比克及齊亞哥夫山防綫，二十日日軍守備隊仍確保原來陣地一敵軍則以　砲射擊繼續一追，及至二十一山崎部隊長鋻於種種情形北進在新守備陣地動員兵力　備於前綫，並使日傷病兵士集中某某灣口，傷兵醫院中仍能作戰老，及其他隨軍人員均武裝配備前棧，或反擊敵軍之態勢，當時糧食彈藥雖尚司不抱悲觀念，兵力與軍械巳逐漸增少，但日軍將士上下一心擊滅敵人之</p>
<p>意氣激昂</p>
<p>而總動員一切武器奮戰力鬥時山崎部隊長已決意以未完全消耗之兵力，作最後之決機至二十二日　敵艦上飛機來襲，至此悉敵航空母艦亦已駛來，二十三日十一時許，日機飛抵阿區島上空助戰，地上將士目睹日機飛來咸為感激，且遠見日機轟炸敵艦隊，海面水花直上天空，敵艦中彈起大火，火光燭天於是全體守軍益形振奮，而敵軍之猛攻亦益激烈，日軍守備地之一部巳被敵突入，乃在最後據點某山南展開激戰，山崎部隊長等雖奮力抗戰，卒因缺乏軍械與兵力，在前綫步兵全部陣亡後，乃以砲兵工兵代前綫守備。二十五日因濃霧漫天，敵軍攻擊尤漸緩和，是日日軍司令官激勵電報到達，活讚阿圖島守備部隊之奮戰孤烏，並祝最後之勇戰，山崎部隊長，曾有覆電，謂全體將士誓以百倍勇氣厥盡水分云云，當時並以阿圖島日守備隊隊此種勇敢偉勳上奏，獲賜向所未見之優遲勒語，此優渥勒語，即於二十五電致山崎部隊長轉遠全將士，全體將士於在北方孤島得接聖旨，無不感泣，報國之決意亦為之一新，二十六日敵軍仍不斷猛攻，山崎部隊長恐無綫電杠不通，乃在彈雨之中　寫敵軍在阿圖島登陸以來之戰鬥狀况，至二十七日二十八日日軍　隊已準備最好突擊，蓋山崎　隊長認雖有其他策略，但徒情耗戰力而不能打擊敵軍，乃準備</p>
<p>最後突擊</p>
<p>不能戰鬥之重輕傷士兵悉數自決，生者成執槍赴的綫作戰，山崎部隊長俟舉碎準備完畢後，乃致電各長官表明盛謝之意，並由日軍當局派機視察該部隊之畢碎情形，繼於二十九夜發出最從之訣別之辭，謂「於此決將無綫電機破壞」，至二十九夜半，全體將士乃向敵軍集中突擊，至於阿圖島日守備部隊三千之英靈，已盡　守備北邊之重大任務。</p>

<h3>奎貝克會議的內幕</h3>
<p>關於奎目克會斗　綜合各方而的　道，羅邱兩氏在二十一日全日研究討　船　問　。邱吉爾在羅斯福到達　貝克之　即已與英國運　大臣萊柴斯及共他船舶專門家討　上述問題。美陸軍部長史汀生，在二十二日如期到達奎貝克，據從該地來的消息，史汀生的到達奎貝克，表示對於反軸心方向的軍事計　的討論事實上巳告終了，史汀生的出席，僅爲了通知史　於使用美軍的詳細約定，　史汀生之後，美國海軍部長諾克斯，亦已到達奎貝克。</p>
<p>開奎貝克會談的主要問題爲：</p>
<p>樹立緩和蘇聯方面、二戰綫要求的作　計劃。</p>
<p>强化各戰綫的空輿作戰。</p>
<p>强化對重慶政權的軍需品之援助</p>
<p>確立一般的作戰計劃。又　邱二氏決定基於武　　借安、而供給蘇　的物資使相常增加，最近即可　行。關於這種　際的問題，曾在某種程度上　　已　一致，但目　最重要的乃是政治問題。英美對　　的關係，依然未曾解決而殘存着。據說現在的會談如不能時論決定，尚須舉行第二次的新會談，紐約泰晤士報的奎貝克特派員强調爲討論解決此次奎貝克　談中未曾解決的問題　　，舉行第二次會談，有絕對的必要，他說：</p>
<p>「這第二次會談中，應保障英，美，加以外的國家自由發言，而且　會談中也應該招待僅為形式問題而出席的小國。此次的奎貝克會談，不過是英，美加會談，召開包括全部反軸心國家的會談，實有絕對的必要。」又蘇聯政府　迭駐美大使，召還李維諸夫氏，任命蘇聯駐　大使館參事官格　姆哥氏為其後任，此事在各方面引起很大的反響上述消息立即通知在奎貝克的羅邱二氏，但二氏在判明莫斯科方面採取此次的措置之前，避免加以任何批評。此次李維諾夫大使的召還，係　英大使邁斯基的召還之後，史太林召還斗這，第一級外交官，而任命無名的年輕人物完任，引起了種種傳說。在蘇聯方面，現在正從事威嚇英美方面，使儘速開闢第二戰綫。</p>
<p>蘇維埃各報在二十二日的報上發表更迭駐華盛頓的大使。蘇維埃政府方而表示，大使雖經更迭，但英美蘇三國問的「根本的友好關係」，並未有所變化。第二戰綫雖依然尚未結成，但蘇維埃政府仍將維持與以前同樣的美蘇二國的關係。唯蘇聯各報的表示，頗現不　，開闢第二戰綫的要求，極為强烈，今後四個月間，以第二戰綫為中心的歐洲戰局的展開，及英美蘇三國互相　視的關係，頗　注目。（翔：譯自八月二十四日西部朝日新關）</p>

<h3>經濟處長解釋　本市糧食問題　營運欠良希望改善</h3>
<p>中央社滬肌本市戶口米時告延期，配給數量又復减少，羣情驚惶，不可終日，雖經糧食機關一再發表本市民食可告無虞，但因事實勝於雄，辯雖釋羣疑，記者特走　第一區公署經濟處陳處長，叩詢眞相，承見告如下：</p>
<p>七月起由糧部指撥</p>
<p>本市之戶口米，七月以來，係由糧食部每月指撥，在蘇州湖州南京揚州一帶所採購之國米，共十五萬包委託　糧聯營社運至上海，連同友邦供給之洋米，合共二十餘萬包，而前公共租界（第一區）與前法親界（第八區、領得十萬包，以第一區人口約1百四十萬人，第八區人口約七卞萬人而論，每人每十日可得米之配給二升，加之麵粉每十日一市斤半不論老幼大小，每月合計得米六升及　粉四斤半。七月以來，洋米雖由友邦稱有運來，而糧食部指撥之七月份十五萬包，自七月初至今五十餘日內，僅運到十一萬數千包。</p>
<p>八月份米迄未起運</p>
<p>八月份應撥之米十五萬包，則尚朱起運，以致戶口米大受影修，此為全上海米糧問題之　結所在。第一，八兩區四十四期戶口米，原僅能供給一升，本處鑒於民食問題之重要，特另設法在四十五期麵粉配給，加多半市斤，稍資　補。惟麵　亦早有配給之定量，不能隨意增加，因此商請國府糧食　局設法，及日本有關方面予以協助。</p>
<p>商借洋米應付急需</p>
<p>第以米糧聯管社之營運欠良，已如上述，而民食一日不能中斷，不得巳向友邦方面商借洋米一部份，每人約得半升，及雜糧一部份，每人約得半市斤，並將四十六期戶口粉從速配給，以應急需，所望市民明悉此為意外特殊情形，毋過憂慮，深信各　係方面，對於整個糧食問題，當有一妥善解決方法，以維民食。</p>
<h3>本期戶口米暫減為半升今起發售另給雜糧半斤下期戶口麺粉數量公布</h3>
<p>第四十五期戶口米目今日起發售，每一　布告，第四十五期麵粉出售，明爲最後一天，第四卞六期自九月一日起至九日止發賣，每票一市斤半，價為十元半。又為補充民食起見，以前所發之雜糧證第二號，可於九月一日至五日瞳，憑買雜糧半斤，價為二元，茲錄第一區公署昨發之布告於後：</p>
<p>一區公署昨發布吿</p>
<p>查第四須於本年八月三十日，用以領購麺粉，逾期作廢。自本年八月二十九日至九月五日之期間內，本區內棧，僅憑第四十五號買米聯票，出售食米，零售米店當於收到每一張標明該店號　之該號聯票時，出　白米及（或）碎米及（或）糙米半升，價洋三元。自水年九月一日至九月五日之期問內，本區內各冷售米店及本署各售米棧，僅發買雜糧聯票第二號，出售雜糧零售米店，當于收到每一張標明該店戰數之該號聯票時、出售苞米及（或）大麥及（或）去皮大麥及（或）高粱半市斤，價二元。自本年九月一日至九月九日之期間內，本區內各零售米店及本署各售米棧，僅憑第四十六號買麵粉聯票，出售麵粉零售米店。常於收到每一張標明該店號數之該號聯票時，出售二號麵粉一市斤半，價十元零五角。再本年八月三十一日及九月十日本區內各零售米店及本署各售米棧，均暫停業。第四十六號買米聯票之　米數景，常另行公佈。</p>

<h3>各廠出粉將配給價格已決定</h3>
<p>本年度新麥登塲之後，全團商業統制聽會即往蘇　皖三省各地積極收習，迄至目前為止，數量已達八百萬包以上。是項小麥巳由粉麥專委會配給於各地麵粉廠，現正日夜　緊出粉中，商業針記者頃悉，各　出粉巳有相當　量、粉麥專委曾即將按照一所訂粉麩配給　施方案，實行配粉，價格亦已決定，一等粉三百十一元二角六分，二等粉二百七十元一零六分，三等粉二百零八元二角六分，每日配給總量為三萬八千萬擔，凡配給之廠商，均予百分之二十合法利潤。</p>

<h3>銀錢業辨別偽鈔　决愼重將事　當局確保幣信措置中對民間損失盼籌補救</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行因近來市上迭有該行之五元十元僞鈔發現，且此種僞鈔之紙張印刷，粗視之幾可亂眞，該行為免人民遭受損失起見，遂於作日正式公佈僞鈔上所印之英文字　及字尾，以及其他各點區別。消息所播，全市　目。良以根據中儲所發表之僞鈔字碼觀之、此種僞鈔，流行市上者不少，一般市民及商人在使用時，即覺異常不便。頃據　錢業中人告商業社記者謂，一兩月　，本埠各銀行錢莊即發現中儲券五元券興十元券中雜有僞鈔，其數量相當可觀，但一則眞僞不易辨認，二則中儲當局，尚無正式表示，今中儲當局將僞鈔字碼及區別詳細發表後，各銀錢行莊及工商各界在收付鈔票時，自須愼重將事，仔细分別。惟平民在經濟上所受之打　甚巨，為今之計，中儲當局為確保貨幣之信用及平民之生活，對於此種　鈔，一面固宜拒絕使用，一而似須薄措一補救辦法，總以不使平民損失過巨為原則，　資補救</p>
<h3>華北記者團　昨抵滬</h3>

<h3>郭元瑞　効忠和運</h3>
<p>（中央社訊）本市保安成於兩月前，接獲密報稱，有渝方忠救軍京滬綫政治特派員辦公處．最近派員來滬活動，並購買物資等情。當即密派幹員，分頭密查，果於六月十七日，在北火車站拘獲該特派員辦公處秘書邪元瑞︽化名　一飛）等數名，經分別偵訊後，除嫌疑犯數名，囚　係無關，當即取保聞釋外，至郭元瑞本人，因證據確　，無法抵　，即經全部自承不諱，惟保安處自將該員加以拘捕後，仍極予優待，一面施予感化，故該員在保安處，經兩月來之反省後，現已誠心悔悟過去參加抗戰組織之非計，尤以最近適常友邦交還租界之事實表現，益使該員明白友邦協助建設新中國之誠意，決意効忠和運，頗予自新，保安處為仰體最高領袖及陳市長對渝方靑年寬大為懷之本旨起見，業於昨日取保開釋矣。</p>
<h3>全面抑平物價　為期已下遠　物資調查發動</h3>
<p>本市全面　厲壓制物價辦法及對違法者實施更普遍之嚴峻罰規，預料已將由當局開始執行，最近雨京路六家商號之被勒令停業數天，即為阻止囤積不法牟利之大規模行助之先聲。且此後當局將據大範圍及於各其他區域，蓋自兩租界接收後市政旣歸統一，功令自可普週統一施行。</p>
<p>調查人員證明文件</p>
<p>物資委員曾自展開調查工作以來，最近該會密切調查張類肉類市價，經分別傳詢各該業負責人詳細查詢，並責令竭力疏通凍源，壓平批價，聞該會經此次强化調查工作，對於調查員資格　重審查，所派調查人員均有出勤用之大黃色職員證，證上蓋有關防及委員長名章，黏貼本人照片，加蓋硬印，並另　調查員問形銀色證章，證章面上　右物資調查會調查員以及號碼等字樣，出勤調查時並另行頒發調查通知　，以資證明，而昭鄭重，至於該會內勤人員用之藍色布面職員證以及小關形卜鐫「物賣調查」金色證章，僅作內勤職員證明身份之用，絕對小　調查物資，外界人士如遇有證件不全而假該會名義前來調查物資者，即係不肖之徒”充，儘可扭送就　　察機關依法嚴辦，該會並希市民合作，隨時舉發，以廓淸敗類。</p>
<h3>一區公署設立　行政會議</h3>
<p>一中央社　訊上海特別市第一區公署，對前工部局市參事會下設置之財務，警務，民防空保甲，工務，人事，公共事業，衛生，教育，產業社會問題查定，控訴物資統制，綜合，補助金，調停，特別諮詢，家賃統制，交通，乳製品等二十個委員會，經行政會議議決，對其中公共學業，綜合，特別諮詢，家賃統制，乳製品等五委員會，因無存在之必要，故予撤銷，而對本市物價問題，應申審議之必要，故另行成立一物價委員會，同時對人事委員會，重行改組分高級低級兩委員會，並在十七個委員會之上，再設一行政會議，執掌管理各委員會之事務，由吳主任秘書頌　，小澤顧問·高瀨特別秘書，孫總務處長理甫，昆野財務處長，　口秘書處第一課長等，為行政會議委員，</p>

<p>此次舉辦歷代畫展，為嘗試性質，對於諸大收藏出品安全保護問題，雖亦竭心周至，但以書畫價値過於名貴，不　過分徵求，故於此次畫展，擬定始自元初迄於淸未，俟辦有成績，然後再　而為唐宋展覽，乃蒙海內　家　虛齋先生惠然，概以北宋郭熙眞踏見假，使本苑　價頓增百倍，使敝會精神上得到無限　怏，此當誌謝者三。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>統制經濟下應有的知識</h3>
<p>我國民族是由來以個人生義經濟生活爲中心的，所以不　於國家用權力來管理經濟的原理，一聽到「統制」兩個字，便要感覺不安，甚至談　色　，若是聽到「收買」兩個字，更要相顧失色，有如驚弓之烏，殊不知收買不過是推行統制經濟　多工具中的一個；出買以後，自有配給，配給而外，自有生產。</p>
<p>我們不是脫過嗎？一件事精，必須剖柝事理，旁徵博究，不要妄加揣度自．貽伊戚。譬如，因為政府收買棉紗棉布，遂以為紗廠將不能紡　，常見統制醫藥用品，遂以爲藥廠將不能製藥，豈非　人自擾？除非是昧於事理的人，恐怕不應當這樣地去想像罷。須知　花統制以後，紗廠的生　力量可以增加了，藥品原料統制以後，藥廠的製藥成本可以减輕了。</p>
<p>戰時採用統制經濟，所以完成戰爭目的。因此，戰時沒有一個國家不是採用統制經濟的，也可以說沒有一伴事情不是在國家統制中的；生產有生產統制，販賣有販　統制，金融有金融統制，其目的無非要使全國上下一致放棄其個人自由，而爲處於戰爭時代的大多數人民利益着想，因為，「皮之不存，毛將焉附？」水沒有了，魚也絕不會生存的</p>

<h3>Promotion and Fortune</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>On February 14, 1912, Sun Yat-sen resigned as Provisional President. The following day, Yuan Shikai, upon Mr. Sun's recommendation, assumed the office of President. I believe this was the most regrettable event for Mr. Sun. In short, it was due to the government's lack of funds. Mr. Sun believed that it was imperative to maintain the South, so he proposed a loan to Japan. However, this issue made no progress. Later, the Senate resolved to transfer power to Yuan Shikai, and the loan issue became a thing of the past. At this time, Masatsugu Fujise, a director of Mitsui &amp; Co., whom Sun Yat-sen had entrusted to raise funds, managed to secure 300,000 yen. He reported to Mr. Sun, saying, "As per your instructions, I have been running around everywhere, but I have been unable to raise enough funds. I have only managed to scrape together this amount with great effort. Please use it!" Mr. Sun immediately responded, "Thank you for your kindness, but I will not use it." And thus, he declined. Fujise thought that Mr. Sun felt the amount was too small and was expressing his resentment. He felt that "all this hard work and planning to raise the money was in vain." So he retreated in disappointment. However, Fujise later heard that when he brought the money, it was after the Senate had already resolved to remove Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He felt very sad, thinking that if he had delivered the money to Mr. Sun a few days earlier, he might have been able to do something. So he visited Mr. Sun again, saying, "I heard that you unfortunately stepped down. You must need money, so please accept this money!" Mr. Sun Yat-sen replied, "I declined your offer the other day because I no longer needed the money. I have decided to hand over all political power to the North. To maintain political power and run the country, this money would certainly be needed, but as things stand now, it is no longer necessary, so I declined. — As for now, although you say that this money can be used for my personal expenses, I would have no hope of repaying it if I borrowed it, so I can only accept your kindness, but please take the money back." Fujise said, "There may be many twists and turns for you in the future. If you don't have this amount of money, you may not be able to maintain the dignity of a former president. If the loan had been obtained before the Southern government was handed over, what would have happened? Then I would have demanded that the Northern Yuan government repay it…" Upon hearing this, Mr. Sun's attitude gradually changed, and he said, "That is absolutely impossible. We launched the uprising to overthrow the corrupt government of China and to eliminate corrupt elements. If we followed your words, then the first president of the Republic of China would be continuing the old bad practices, and that is absolutely impossible." And thus, he sternly and inviolably rejected Fujise's kindness. After hearing these words, Fujise is said to have been filled with respect and wept. (Talk by Mr. Kayano Nagatomo, a participant in the First Revolution)</p>
<p>The phrase "promotion and fortune" has become a common saying. In a society where officials feel no shame in accepting money, discovering such integrity is truly surprising and exciting for the Japanese. The officialdom in China at that time could be said to be morally corrupt, but we cannot help but painfully acknowledge that the officials of the Republic of China have largely inherited the moral bankruptcy of the Qing Dynasty era.</p>
<p>Lin Yutang, in his article "The Real China," described the corruption of Chinese morals as follows:</p>
<p>"...A staff member (Li Shih-hui) of the National Museum in Beijing colluded with the guards to steal national treasures from the museum's collection, selling them to the highest bidder, turning them into cash, and pocketing the money. He then built a large house without any repercussions. When someone filed a complaint with the court, it was refused. Furthermore, a certain general (Tang Yulin) didn't even put on a show of fighting. He allowed the great mountains and rivers of Rehe Province to be occupied, while he used two hundred military trucks to transport his concubines and family property. Yet the National Government pardoned the crimes of such generals. Many generals, after losing a battle, abandon soldiers and ammunition as if they were worthless, and only focus on transporting their stored opium. Because they sell the opium, they have the capital to buy back power. In order to maintain their undisciplined troops without paying them salaries, they force farmers to grow opium instead of food crops. Therefore, China, which is known as an agricultural country, has to import millions of taels of silver worth of rice and wheat from abroad every year. But in such a lawless state, the people who are directly harmed cannot say 'no' to their rulers and oppressors. There must be something wrong with the country. So the people cannot help but lose all their moral standards and concepts of right and wrong."</p>
<p>Indeed, after the Qing Dynasty became the Republic of China, the corruption in the officialdom remained the same. The term "promotion and fortune" has not been removed from the Chinese dictionary. Even the anti-Japanese Chinese and the British and Americans, who list all the evils of the Japanese, admit that Japanese officials are not ashamed of being poor. In Japan, if an official or politician becomes wealthy, that is sufficient evidence to suspect the person's morality. However, in China, "promotion" is synonymous with "fortune," so no one finds it strange. It is said that there are high-ranking officials who have accumulated tens of millions of fortunes in just three or four years, but no one dares to ask how such a large fortune was accumulated. The people, in the face of this situation, can perhaps truly be said to be "losing all their moral standards and concepts of right and wrong." Then, wasn't Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution simply a revolution that changed the name of the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China? Absolutely not. As Mr. Sun Yat-sen himself said, it "was an uprising to overthrow the corrupt government of China and to eliminate corrupt elements." The Republic of China accepting the return of concessions from Japan cannot be considered "the success of the Chinese revolution." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's movement was a struggle against all the old structures in society (the Communists call them feudal remnants, as if they are just remnants after most of the feudal property has been cleared away, but this certainly does not represent the current state of China). Mr. Sun's revolutionary goal was a social revolution of Chinese democracy. And "promotion and fortune" is the most concrete symbol of a feudal society. Therefore, if we do not fight against "promotion and fortune," Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution completely loses its meaning. Mr. Sun's will regarding the revolution, in the true sense of its words, is indeed the truth that has never been realized in real China. As long as the phrase "promotion and fortune" exists in the Chinese dictionary, as long as it exists in Chinese reality, then we cannot lightly say that the Chinese revolution has succeeded.</p>
<p>—Alas! The revolution has not yet succeeded—(Chinese translation)</p>

<h3>The Loyal and Brave Spirit of the Japanese Soldiers Who Died in Action on Attu Island Will Never Fade. Ninety-Four Officers Posthumously Promoted.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese Army Ministry announced at 4:00 PM on the 28th that the following ninety-four officers, including Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki, who died in action, were posthumously promoted: Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki to Lieutenant General, Lieutenant Colonel Hiroshi Yonekawa to Colonel, Major Tokuji Watanabe and Major Satoshi Aoto to Lieutenant Colonel (omitted below). Lieutenant General Yamazaki's brief biography is as follows: Lieutenant General Yamazaki was from Yamagata Prefecture. In August of the 9th year of Taisho (1920), he was appointed Battalion Commander of an Infantry Regiment. In the 12th year (1923), he was appointed Commander of an Infantry Unit in the mainland. In March of the 14th year (1925), he was appointed Chief of the Armaments Department of the Garrison in China. In August of the 15th year (1926), he was transferred to the Commander of a Mainland Unit. In December, he was transferred to the Commander of the Attu Island Unit. He died in action on Attu Island on May 29th of the 18th year of Showa (1943).</p>
<p>Japanese Army Ministry Awards Citation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) — The Army Ministry announced at 3:00 PM on the 28th that the highest commander of the army in that area had awarded citations to the Yamazaki Unit guarding Attu Island and Lieutenant General Yasuyo Yamazaki after his death. His Majesty the Emperor has been informed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) — On July 14th, the Supreme Commander of the Northeastern Area of Japan presented letters of gratitude to the Yamazaki Unit and Commander Yamazaki for their loyal and brave defense of Attu Island. The letters of gratitude are as follows: The Yamazaki Unit, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Motokawa, consolidated its unity, overcame all difficulties, and guarded Attu Island for a long time. On April 17th of Showa 18 (1943), Colonel Yamazaki arrived and, under his command, further strengthened their united hearts. Accomplished the mission, (omitted above) These troops, in this difficult situation, persevered, fought vigorously, united firmly, resisted the great material power, displayed the highest spirit of loyalty and bravery, killed the enemy effectively, seized their spirits, and made a great contribution to the overall operation. Their actions are truly the essence of the Imperial Army, and their military achievements are outstanding. This letter of gratitude is hereby awarded and announced to the entire army.</p>
<p>The Battle Was Moving and Admirable</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) — The brave warriors of the Yamazaki Unit of the Attu Island garrison, previously on Attu Island, restrained the main force of the US Pacific Fleet and a division of approximately 20,000 troops. They resisted the enemy, causing fear among the enemy's citizens. Due to being outnumbered, all the brave warriors died in action at the end of May. Three months have passed since then. The details of the fierce battle at that time have been reported to the Emperor. The Japanese Army Ministry announced the awarding of citations and posthumous promotions. The details of the Yamazaki Unit's fierce battle are as follows: The Yamazaki Unit included infantry, artillery, and engineers, as well as some communication and medical units, totaling approximately 2,700 men. Led by Lieutenant General Yamazaki (then Colonel), the soldiers defended Attu Island. In April, the enemy attempted to push their air force base westward along the Aleutian Islands. They landed a battalion on Attu Island, 130 kilometers west of Kiska Island, and hastily built an airfield. A month later, they had facilities that could be used by allied bombers. Therefore, in addition to constantly bombing Kiska Island, the US military also scouted the situation on Attu Island, using cruisers and destroyers to prepare for an invasion of Attu Island and to explore the location of the Japanese garrison. By May, the Aleutian Islands had entered</p>
<p>The Foggy Season</p>
<p>There were very few clear days. On May 15th, the enemy took advantage of the fog and sailed a large fleet, escorted by transport ships, to the vicinity of Attu Island. Another unit landed. The Japanese garrison prepared a counterattack, intending to wipe them out as they approached. However, around 10:00 AM, a Japanese observation post discovered a large number of enemy troops heading towards the northern part of the island. The Japanese immediately began a fierce counterattack, trying to prevent the enemy from landing. However, the enemy landed on the beach in a steady stream from three directions: north, central, and south. It was clear that they were numerous. Although the Japanese garrison fought back with all their might, the enemy finally broke through around a certain corner near 7:00 PM. At the same time, the enemy troops who had landed in Massacre Bay were also reported to be approaching. Another unit of enemy troops landed in Sarana Bay at the eastern end of Attu, but was quickly annihilated by the Japanese. However, at that time, the enemy troops who had landed on the north and south shores had already reached the northern area. Therefore, the Japanese garrison launched a night attack on the enemy troops who had landed on the south shore on the night of the 12th, causing them to retreat 1,000 to 1,500 meters. The enemy troops attempting to land in Sarana Bay were also wiped out. The Japanese garrison had achieved great results. By dawn on the 13th, the enemy began aggressive actions with reinforcements. Reinforcements were steadily arriving at Massacre Bay. A large transport ship convoy of the enemy also deployed some troops in a certain bay. Relying on their superior equipment and numerous troops, they began a fierce attack on the Japanese garrison that afternoon. Enemy cruisers also opened fire on the Japanese positions. The Japanese garrison not only resisted the enemy on all fronts and secured their positions, but also lured the enemy to land in a certain area, using mountain guns to annihilate them. The morale of the entire army was greatly boosted. The weather was relatively clear that day, but the visibility on the shore and at sea was only about 300 meters, making the battle particularly difficult. On the 14th, an enemy ship departed from a certain direction with excellent equipment, fiercely attacking the Japanese army and the Japanese H-soldiers defending a certain mountain. At the same time, two battalions of enemy troops who had landed on the shore attacked the Japanese army with several artillery pieces. That day, one small battleship, two cruisers, and three destroyers appeared in the waters near Attu Island, opening fire on various locations. The enemy heavy bombers flew over and bombed the Japanese positions, dropping bombs like rain. That day, the Japanese navy also bravely sortied,</p>
<p>Severely Damaging Enemy Ships</p>
<p>From the 12th, when the enemy landed, until the 14th, the Japanese army suffered only tens of casualties. On the 15th, the Japanese army continued to secure their positions, preventing the advance of ten times as many enemy troops. On the 14th, Japanese forces in a certain bay had launched a night attack, disrupting the enemy positions. However, due to the gradual increase in the number of enemy troops, weapons, and equipment, the battlefield gradually became more difficult. The Japanese garrison in that area had already seen a part of their troops make heroic sacrifices. At the same time, the enemy's attack on Massacre Bay became increasingly fierce. Enemy 15cm shells fell on the Japanese positions in a flurry. With the distance between the two sides being only 150 to 200 meters, the Japanese army carried out a night attack at noon that day. After fierce hand-to-hand combat, the enemy was forced to retreat over 900 meters. However, due to the thinner fog that day, the enemy's artillery fire was extremely intense. On that day, enemy transport ships continued to transport personnel and equipment to the shore. The number of enemy troops was approximately one division, totaling 20,000 men, all with special equipment. On the 16th, the enemy used heavy artillery and equipment, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese positions from land, sea, and air, resulting in the total sacrifice of one Japanese platoon. On that day, enemy transport ships continued to land. The commander of the Yamazaki Unit moved ammunition and food stored upstream of a certain river to the mouth of the bay on that day, determined to counterattack the enemy in front. From the 16th, from midnight to the 17th all day, they moved to the key area of the mouth of Chichagof Bay. At this time, all Japanese boats had been sunk, and the sea was also suppressed. The enemy fiercely attacked to hinder the concentration of Japanese forces. At dawn, because the planes mistook their targets, they mistakenly bombed the enemy's first line, which was ridiculous. Although the Japanese garrison was subjected to random enemy fire, they still completed the move to the mouth of the bay. They used the Kulu Circle formation near Mount East as the front line, attempting to strengthen their position and deploy troops to conduct operations in the Mupu area. The enemy concentrated artillery fire on the Japanese. On the 19th, the enemy began transporting supplies to the enemy who landed on Attu Island. Enemy ground troops also continued to attack. The Japanese, due to being outnumbered, had no choice but to retreat. The commander of the Yamazaki Unit ordered a unit to prepare to retreat to the Picke and Chichagof Mountain defense lines. On the 20th, the Japanese garrison continued to secure their original positions. The enemy continued to pursue with artillery fire. On the 21st, the commander of the Yamazaki Unit, in light of the various circumstances, advanced north, mobilized troops at the new defense positions, prepared at the front line, and concentrated the wounded soldiers at the mouth of a certain bay. The wounded soldiers in the hospital who could still fight and other military personnel were armed and deployed at the front lines, in a posture to counterattack the enemy. At that time, although there was still no need to be pessimistic about food and ammunition, the number of troops and weapons gradually decreased. However, the Japanese officers and soldiers were united in their determination to destroy the enemy.</p>
<p>Spirits Were High</p>
<p>And when mobilizing all weapons to fight fiercely, Commander Yamazaki had already decided to use the incompletely depleted force to make the final decisive move. On the 22nd, enemy warships and aircraft attacked. At this point, it was clear that enemy aircraft carriers had also arrived. Around 11:00 AM on the 23rd, Japanese aircraft flew to the skies over Attu Island to provide assistance. The soldiers on the ground were grateful to see the Japanese aircraft flying in. They saw the Japanese aircraft bombing the enemy fleet from afar. Splashes of water shot into the sky, and enemy ships caught fire. The entire garrison was greatly invigorated, and the enemy's fierce attack became even more intense. A part of the Japanese defensive position had been penetrated by the enemy. A fierce battle unfolded at the final stronghold, south of a certain mountain. Commander Yamazaki and others fought bravely, but due to a lack of weapons and manpower, after all the infantry on the front line had died in action, artillery and engineers replaced them as front-line defenders. On the 25th, due to the dense fog, the enemy's attack gradually eased. On that day, an encouraging telegram from the Japanese commander arrived, praising the brave and isolated struggle of the Attu Island garrison and wishing them a final heroic battle. Commander Yamazaki sent a reply, saying that all officers and soldiers vowed to exert themselves with a hundred times their courage, etc. At that time, the bravery and great achievements of the Japanese garrison on Attu Island were reported, and they were awarded unprecedented praise. This praise was telegraphed to Commander Yamazaki on the 25th and relayed to all the soldiers. All the soldiers were moved to tears when they received the imperial edict on the remote northern island. Their determination to serve the country was renewed. On the 26th, the enemy continued to attack fiercely. Commander Yamazaki, fearing that wireless communications would be cut off, wrote down the details of the battle since the enemy landed on Attu Island amidst the hail of bullets. By the 27th and 28th, the Japanese forces had prepared for the final assault. Commander Yamazaki believed that although there were other strategies, they would only waste fighting power and would not be able to strike the enemy. Therefore, he prepared for the</p>
<p>Final Assault</p>
<p>All seriously wounded soldiers who could not fight took their own lives. The survivors took up their guns and went to the front line to fight. After Commander Yamazaki waited for all preparations to be completed, he telegraphed each commander to express his gratitude. The Japanese authorities sent a plane to observe the final situation of the unit. Then, on the night of the 29th, they issued the final farewell message, saying, "We have decided to destroy the wireless communication device here." By midnight on the 29th, all the officers and soldiers launched a concentrated attack on the enemy. Thus, the 3,000 heroic spirits of the Japanese garrison on Attu Island fulfilled the important task of defending the northern border.</p>

<h3>Inside the Quebec Conference</h3>
<p>Regarding the Quebec Conference, according to comprehensive reports from various sources, Roosevelt and Churchill spent the entire day of the 21st studying and discussing the shipping problem. Before Roosevelt arrived in Quebec, Churchill had already discussed the above-mentioned issue with British Minister of Transport Leathers and other shipping experts. US Secretary of War Stimson arrived in Quebec on the 22nd as scheduled. According to news from that location, Stimson's arrival in Quebec indicates that the discussion of military plans for the anti-Axis direction has in fact come to an end. Stimson's attendance was only to inform the specifics of the agreement on the use of American troops. After Stimson, US Secretary of the Navy Knox also arrived in Quebec.</p>
<p>The main issues of the Quebec Conference were:</p>
<p>Establishing an operational plan to alleviate the Soviet Union's demand for a second front.</p>
<p>Strengthening air combat on all fronts.</p>
<p>Strengthening aid of military supplies to the Chongqing government.</p>
<p>Establishing a general operational plan. Furthermore, Roosevelt and Churchill decided, based on the Mutual Defense Agreement, to substantially increase the supplies provided to the Soviet Union, which will be implemented soon. Regarding these international issues, a consensus has been reached to some extent, but the most important issue at present is the political issue. The relationship between Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union remains unresolved and remains. It is said that if this conference cannot reach a decision in a timely manner, a second new conference will be held. The New York Times correspondent in Quebec emphasized that in order to discuss and resolve the issues that were not resolved in this Quebec conference, it is absolutely necessary to hold a second conference. He said:</p>
<p>"In this second conference, countries other than Britain, the United States, and Canada should be guaranteed the freedom to speak, and the conference should also invite small countries that attend only for formal issues. This Quebec conference is only a conference between Britain, the United States, and Canada. It is absolutely necessary to convene a conference including all anti-Axis countries." Also, the Soviet government recalled its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, and appointed Soviet embassy counselor Gromyko as his successor. This matter caused a great reaction in all aspects. The above news was immediately notified to Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec, but the two avoided making any criticism before clarifying the measures taken by Moscow. This recall of Ambassador Litvinov follows the recall of British Ambassador Maisky. Stalin's recall of this first-class diplomat and the appointment of an unknown young man to the position has given rise to various rumors. On the Soviet side, they are now engaged in threatening Britain and the United States to quickly open a second front.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, Soviet newspapers published the replacement of the ambassador to Washington. The Soviet government stated that although the ambassador has been replaced, the "fundamental friendly relations" between the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, have not changed. Although the second front has not yet been formed, the Soviet government will maintain the same relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union as before. However, the Soviet newspapers' expressions were quite dissatisfied, and the demand for the opening of a second front was extremely strong. In the next four months, the development of the European war situation centered on the second front, and the relationship of mutual surveillance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, are worthy of attention.

<h3>Tram Company Adds Vehicles</h3>
<p>It is heard that the tram company authorities are currently planning to issue seasonal tickets for children based on district zoning, and the price will be half that of adult tickets. It is also revealed that since the bus service was suspended, the trams have become crowded. In order to remedy this situation, the company recently purchased 30 passenger cars and 20 trailers from the Nanshi Tram Company. Among them, 10 passenger cars have already been put into operation, and 5 trailers will also be put into operation in the near future.</p>
<h3>Economic Director Explains the City's Food Problem - Poor Operation, Hope for Improvement</h3>
<p>The household rice registration in Shanghai has been postponed, and the allocated quantity has been reduced again. The public is panicked and cannot live in peace. Although the food authorities have repeatedly stated that there is no need to worry about the people's food in this city, because facts speak louder than eloquence, although it may dispel public doubts, this reporter specially visited Director Chen of the Economic Department of the First District Office to inquire about the truth. He told me the following:</p>
<p>Allocated by the Ministry of Food Since July</p>
<p>Since July, the household rice in this city has been allocated by the Ministry of Food every month. The national rice purchased in the Suzhou, Huzhou, Nanjing, and Yangzhou areas, totaling 150,000 bags, is entrusted to the United Food Joint Operations Society to transport to Shanghai. Together with the foreign rice supplied by friendly nations, the total is more than 200,000 bags. The former International Settlement (First District) and the former French Concession (Eighth District) receive 100,000 bags. Considering that the population of the First District is approximately 1.4 million and the population of the Eighth District is approximately 770,000, each person can receive a rice allocation of 2 liters every 10 days, plus 1.5 jin of flour every 10 days, regardless of age. The monthly total is 6 liters of rice and 4.5 jin of flour. Since July, although friendly nations have claimed to be shipping foreign rice, only 110,000+ bags of the 150,000 bags allocated by the Ministry of Food in July have been transported in more than 50 days from the beginning of July to the present.</p>
<p>August Rice Has Not Yet Been Shipped</p>
<p>The 150,000 bags of rice that should have been allocated in August have not yet been shipped, which has greatly affected the household rice. This is the key to the entire Shanghai rice and grain problem. The 44th period of household rice in the First and Eighth Districts could originally only supply 1 liter. The office, in view of the importance of the people's food problem, has specially found a way to add half a jin of flour to the flour allocation in the 45th period to slightly supplement it. However, there is also a fixed quota for flour allocation, which cannot be increased at will. Therefore, we have requested the National Government Food Administration and relevant Japanese parties to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Borrowing Foreign Rice to Meet Urgent Needs</p>
<p>Since the operation of the Rice and Grain Joint Management Society is poor, as mentioned above, and the people's food cannot be interrupted for a day, we have had to borrow a portion of foreign rice from friendly nations, approximately half a liter per person, and a portion of miscellaneous grains, approximately half a jin per person, and expedite the allocation of household flour for the 46th period to meet urgent needs. It is hoped that the citizens will understand that this is an unexpected and special situation and not worry too much. It is firmly believed that all relevant parties will have a proper solution to the entire food problem to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>This Period's Household Rice Temporarily Reduced to Half a Liter, Now on Sale, Additional Half a Jin of Miscellaneous Grains Issued - Quantity of Next Period's Household Flour Announced</h3>
<p>The 45th period of household rice is now on sale, each announcement. The sale of flour for the 45th period is said to be the last day. The 46th period will be sold from September 1st to the 9th, at 1.5 jin per ticket, priced at 10.5 yuan. Also, in order to supplement the people's food supply, the previously issued Miscellaneous Grain Certificate No. 2 can be used to purchase half a jin of miscellaneous grains from September 1st to the 5th, priced at 2 yuan. The announcement issued by the First District Office yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Announcement Issued by the First District Office Yesterday</p>
<p>It is hereby announced that the fourth ticket must be used by August 30th of this year to purchase flour, and will be invalid after the deadline. During the period from August 29th to September 5th of this year, the rice shops in this district will only sell rice with the 45th rice purchase ticket, and the retail rice shops shall issue half a liter of white rice and/or broken rice and/or brown rice at a price of three yuan when they receive each of the tickets with the shop number marked on it. During the period from September 1st to September 5th of this year, each retail rice shop in this district and each rice shop of this office will only sell miscellaneous grains with the Miscellaneous Grain Purchase Ticket No. 2, and the retail rice shops shall sell half a jin of corn and/or barley and/or hulled barley and/or sorghum at a price of two yuan when they receive each of the tickets with the shop number marked on it. During the period from September 1st to September 9th of this year, each retail rice shop in this district and each rice shop of this office will only sell flour with the 46th flour purchase ticket, and the retail rice shops shall sell 1.5 jin of No. 2 flour at a price of ten yuan and five cents when they receive each of the tickets with the shop number marked on it. Furthermore, all retail rice shops in this district and all rice shops of this office will be temporarily closed on August 31st and September 10th of this year. The quantity of rice for the 46th rice purchase ticket will be announced separately.</p>
<p>The Third Police Bureau also issued the same notice yesterday.</p>
<p>The Eighth District Regularly Issues Rice Tickets</p>
<p>The Food and Price Management Department of the Third Police Bureau of the Special Municipality hereby announces: Regarding the issuance of the 13th period of household rice and household flour tickets: The 13th period of household flour tickets (Purchase Certificates Nos. 49 to 52) will be issued starting on Wednesday, September 1st. The usage date and available quantity of the tickets will be announced later. The heads of each household will be notified by the Lianbao chiefs to bring the household head's certificate paper and the housing tax bill for May and June of this year (both) to the issuing office in each district to claim the tickets on the scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Prices of Flour from Each Factory to Be Allocated Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>Since the new wheat of this year came on the market, the General Commerce Control Office of the whole group has been actively acquiring it in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui. Up to now, the quantity has reached more than 8 million bags. This wheat has been allocated by the Flour and Wheat Special Committee to flour mills in various places, and they are now working day and night to produce flour. The Commercial News reporter recently learned that each factory has a considerable output of flour. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee will immediately implement the allocation of flour according to the previously established flour and bran allocation plan. The prices have also been determined: 311 yuan, 2 jiao and 6 fen for first-class flour, 270 yuan, 1 mao and 6 fen for second-class flour, and 208 yuan, 2 jiao and 6 fen for third-class flour. The total daily allocation is 38 million dan. All allocated manufacturers are given a 20% legal profit.</p>
<h3>Five Major Bookstores Offer Preferential Treatment to Poor Students - Detailed Measures to Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>The five major bookstores in this city, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, World, Datong, and Kaiming, in order to respond to the New Student and School Movement in Shanghai and to reduce the burden on poor students, will universally offer book vouchers and preferential treatment. All students approved by the New Student and School in Shanghai can enjoy preferential rights when purchasing textbooks and other items from the above five bookstores. They are currently working with the trade association to formulate detailed measures. Once a decision is made, it will be announced. Because of the expensive paper and book prices, which poor students cannot afford, approved students often write to express their difficulties. The water newspaper stipulates that it cannot universally assist students, which is deeply regrettable. Now the five bookstores have initiated the offering of preferential book vouchers to reduce the burden on students. This benevolent and righteous act is worthy of praise from the academic community.</p>

<h3>Silver and Money Industry Identifies Counterfeit Banknotes - Decided to Act Cautiously - Authorities Taking Measures to Ensure Currency Credit - Hope to Raise Compensation for Losses of the People</h3>
<p>Because the Central Reserve Bank has recently discovered five-yuan and ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes of the bank on the market, and the paper and printing of these counterfeit banknotes are almost indistinguishable from the real ones, the bank officially announced the English letters and suffixes printed on the counterfeit banknotes yesterday, as well as other distinctions, in order to avoid losses to the people. The news spread throughout the city. Based on the counterfeit banknote codes announced by the Central Reserve, there are many such counterfeit banknotes circulating on the market, which is extremely inconvenient for the general public and businessmen to use. According to people in the silver and money industry, the reporter of the Commercial News learned that a month or two ago, banks and money shops in this port discovered that there were counterfeit banknotes mixed in the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes of the Central Reserve, and the quantity was quite considerable. However, on the one hand, it was not easy to identify the real and fake ones, and on the other hand, the Central Reserve authorities had not yet made a formal statement. Now that the Central Reserve authorities have announced the counterfeit banknote codes and distinctions in detail, all silver and money shops and industrial and commercial circles must act cautiously and carefully distinguish when receiving and paying banknotes. However, the economic impact on the common people is very great. As for the plan for today, the Central Reserve authorities should, in order to ensure the credit of the currency and the lives of the common people, on the one hand, refuse to use such banknotes, and on the other hand, seem to take a remedy. The principle is to prevent the common people from suffering excessive losses, and to provide compensation.</p>
<h3>North China Journalist Group Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>A group of fifteen North China newspaper reporters arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou at 9:20 last night according to the planned itinerary. Liu Kechang, the section chief of the Municipal Propaganda Office, and Commissioner Fang, and representatives of the Shanghai press went to the North Railway Station to welcome them. After the journalist group got off the train, they shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Then, they took the special car provided by the Municipal Propaganda Office to the New Asia Hotel, where they stayed. The list of the entire group and the scheduled itinerary are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Full Group List</p>
<p>Cai Tianmei (leader), Wu Wei (deputy former leader), Xu [blank], Zhang Wenxin, Du Xusheng, [blank] Yi Kun, Chen Genglin, Liu Kunming, Qi [blank] Zhan, Zhang Wenxi, Zhao Xi [blank], Qiao Satong, [blank] Zhi [blank], Chen [blank] Shi, Wu Mengsong [15 members].</p>
<p>Scheduled Itinerary</p>

<h3>Guo Yuanrui Professes Loyalty to Peaceful Movement</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Two months ago, the Municipal Security Office received a secret report that the Chongqing Loyalty and National Salvation Army's Political Commissioner Office for the Beijing-Shanghai Line had recently sent people to Shanghai to carry out activities and purchase materials. The office immediately secretly dispatched officers to secretly investigate, and on June 17, Guo Yuanrui (alias Yi Fei), the secretary of the commissioner's office, and several others were arrested at the North Railway Station. After separate interrogations, several suspects who were found to be irrelevant were released on bail. As for Guo Yuanrui himself, because the evidence was conclusive and there was no way to deny it, he fully confessed without reservation. However, the Security Office still treated the officer with great courtesy after arresting him, and gave him education and influence. Therefore, after two months of reflection in the Security Office, the officer has now sincerely regretted his non-plan to participate in the anti-Japanese organization in the past. In particular, the recent facts that friendly nations have returned the concessions have made the officer understand the sincerity of friendly nations in assisting the construction of a new China, and has decided to profess loyalty to the peaceful movement and has given himself a new life. In order to follow the supreme leader and Mayor Chen's magnanimous spirit towards the youth of Chongqing, the Security Office released him on bail yesterday.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Suppression of Prices - Deadline is Not Far Away - Investigation of Materials Launched</h3>
<p>The city's comprehensive and strict price suppression measures and the implementation of more widespread and severe penalties for violators are expected to be implemented by the authorities. The recent forced closure of six businesses on Yanjing Road for several days is the prelude to large-scale action to prevent hoarding and illegal profiteering. Furthermore, the authorities will then extend to various other areas on a large scale. Since the municipal administration has been unified after the reception of the two concessions, the powers can be uniformly implemented in a universal way.</p>
<p>Investigator Identification</p>
<p>Since the Materials Committee launched the investigation work, the committee has recently closely investigated the market prices of grains and meat. It has separately summoned the responsible persons of each industry to inquire in detail, and ordered them to do their best to dredge the frozen sources and suppress the wholesale prices. It is heard that the committee has re-examined the qualifications of the investigators after strengthening the investigation work. The investigators dispatched have a large yellow staff certificate for attendance, with the official seal and the chairman's name stamp affixed on the certificate, a photo of the investigator affixed, and a hard seal affixed. In addition, the investigators have a small silver badge with the words "Investigator of the Materials Investigation Committee" and the number on the badge. The investigators are issued an investigation notice for attendance to prove their identity and to show seriousness. As for the blue cloth staff certificate and the small round gold badge with the words "Materials Investigation" used by the internal staff of the committee, they are only used to prove the identity of the internal staff and are absolutely not allowed to investigate materials. If outsiders encounter people who have incomplete documents and come to investigate materials in the name of the committee, they are unscrupulous people who are impersonating the committee. They can be turned over to the nearest police organ for strict handling according to the law. The committee also hopes that citizens will cooperate and report them at any time to clear the scum.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the First District Public Office - Administrative Meeting</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The First District Public Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality, with respect to the former Shanghai Municipal Council's subordinate committees, including those for finance, police affairs, civil air defense, baojia system, public works, personnel, public utilities, sanitation, education, industrial social issues investigation, appeals, materials control, comprehensive affairs, subsidies, mediation, special consultation, rent control, transportation, dairy products, etc., after deliberation by the administrative meeting, decided that the five committees for public education, comprehensive affairs, special consultation, rent control, and dairy products were unnecessary and therefore abolished. Due to the need to review the city's price issues, a price committee was established. At the same time, the personnel committee was reorganized into two committees, senior and junior. Above the seventeen committees, an administrative meeting was established to manage the affairs of all committees, with Chief Secretary Wu Song, Advisor Ozawa, Special Secretary Takase, Director of General Affairs Sun Lifu, Director of Finance Kunino, and Chief of the First Section of the Secretariat, as members of the administrative meeting.</p>
<h3>Reminder to Collect Subsidies</h3>
<p>This organization has approved students in various scholarship groups to collect their subsidies. Except for the university business and industry groups, all other groups have already passed the prescribed dates. It is now stipulated that, except for those who have requested to retain them in their letters, all students must collect their subsidies from this office before the 31st, so as to bring the matter to a close as soon as possible. It is hoped that all students who have not yet collected their subsidies will pay attention.</p>
<p>Subsidies Cancelled</p>
<p>Zhongyi Ben Yongxiang, Junior High School Second Grade Wang E, Junior High School Third Grade Fang Zhihao, Ben Xuedong Shishu, Senior High School First Grade Wang Meiyan, Feng Dingyi, Tang Dong, Fang Kang, Fei Yuzhong, Zeng Wenbi, Commercial High School Shi Zhongshi, University Group Zhang Peiheng, have all sent letters requesting to cancel their approved subsidies.</p>
<p>Approval to Change Schools</p>
<p>Junior High School Second Grade Xu Gao is approved to transfer to the First China Vocational School, subsidy of 160 yuan. Junior High School Third Grade Li Jianhua is approved to transfer to Guangshi Middle School, Senior High School First Grade Guangxin is approved to transfer to Datong Middle School, Senior High School Third Grade Bixian is approved to transfer to China Vocational Supplementary School, subsidy of 120 yuan. University Group Xingfu is approved to transfer to Shanghai Art College, Mu Songtao is approved to transfer to Shanghai Business College, subsidy of 500 yuan. (For all those where changes to the subsidy amount are not specified, the amount remains the same.)</p>
<p>Approval of Subsidies</p>
<p>University Group Cheng Xu, Shanghai Comparative College, 780 yuan. Cheng Wenying, Renmin University, 700 yuan. Wang Miaohan, Datong University, 800 yuan. Furthermore, this newspaper has learned that Shantang Wangren donated 2,240 yuan in scholarships, designated to support impoverished students at Shixue Elementary School. However, by the time of the scholarship application deadline, some schools did not have clear information on their impoverished students and did not submit applications. Therefore, at the request of the donor, late applications from 18 students will be considered. Except for Gao Xiaoyisheng, Jiang Xiuxi, Yan Hongjun, and Zhou Honghai, who have passed the newspaper assessment and are approved for subsidies of 200 yuan each, the remaining 14 students from Elementary School Year 1 to Year 4 have been assessed by the donors as coming from impoverished families. The school board has decided to allocate the donation amount appropriately, with each student receiving a subsidy of 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>### Records of Calligraphy and Painting Collection from the Chinese Painting Academy</h3>
<p>— Chen Dingshan</p>
<p>Recently, I and several gentlemen founded the Chinese Painting Academy at 470 Chengdu Road, with an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties as its first undertaking. Ji Qian and Bangda and I were responsible for soliciting paintings. After sixty days of planning and preparation, we are fortunate to announce its completion. I hereby express my gratitude as follows:</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty or more collectors in Shanghai. The aim this time was to request two or three works from each person, totaling about one hundred and thirty to fifty pieces. However, by today's deadline, we have already exceeded three hundred pieces, all of which are masterpieces. More are still coming in continuously. The enthusiastic support of collectors at home and abroad is worthy of mention, one.</p>
<p>All of the paintings in this exhibition are non-sale items. Initially, we planned not to sell tickets, but fearing overcrowding, we decided on a ticket price of twenty yuan, with half of the proceeds donated to the Shen and Xin newspapers' scholarship funds. We are grateful for the enthusiastic promotion by economic figures and social elites, which greatly benefits impoverished students. This is by no means a small amount, and this is worthy of our thanks, two.</p>
<p>This exhibition of paintings from past dynasties is of an experimental nature. Although we have tried our best to ensure the safety and protection of the works produced by the major collectors, due to the exceedingly high value of the calligraphy and paintings, we did not over solicit them. Therefore, for this exhibition, we planned to start from the early Yuan Dynasty up to the late Qing Dynasty. After achieving success, we will then expand to Tang and Song exhibitions. We are grateful to Mr. Xuzhai, a collector from home and abroad, for generously offering Guo Xi's "True Traces" from the Northern Song Dynasty, which increased the value of this academy a hundredfold and gave our association unlimited spiritual joy. This deserves our thanks, three.</p>
<p>Collectors at home and abroad such as Wu Puxin, Tan He, Zhang Congyu, Sun Bangjun, and Tui'an have collections no less than those of Yunlin, Qingmi, Zijin, and Tianlai. This time, they all selected the finest and most unique pieces to lend their support. Masterpieces of the Yuan Dynasty are all from their collections. The Ming and Qing masterpieces discussed by Gu Songlin, Jin Meixian, Zhao Zhongying, and others are also mutually reinforcing, allowing this exhibition to have a systematic arrangement. The Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters, the Ming Dynasty's Wen, Shen, Tang, and Chou, the Qing Dynasty's Four Wangs, Wu, the Eight Greats, and Shi Tao, as well as Xin Luo and Liang, are all exquisitely selected. This deserves our thanks, four.</p>
<p>The original plan was to display one hundred and fifty items, but the number of items solicited was almost twice that amount. Therefore, we plan to change the displayed items daily, so that visitors can fully appreciate each piece. We are also grateful to the major paper and fan shops, as well as the four major companies and major restaurants and silk shops on Nanjing Road, for their willingness to consign sales and support the publicity. This deserves our thanks, five.</p>
<p>Since the closure of the Daxin Painting Hall, painters have generally felt the lack of a suitable exhibition venue. The Chinese Painting Academy is centrally located, with spacious high-rise buildings, making it the only good location. Furthermore, the name "Daguan Tang" was inscribed by [blank] Hu, and the name "Chinese Painting Academy" was inscribed by Hu Fan in a magnificent and elegant style. This is worthy of our gratitude, six.</p>
<p>Recently, the heat has been even more intense than during the dog days. Ji Qian, Bangda, Dabang, and Ziqi are all key members of the academy and are working particularly hard. From numbering and arranging the exhibits to working through the night, they are sweating profusely. However, they have had the privilege of feasting their eyes on over three hundred masterpieces from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. This is worthy of our gratitude, seven.</p>

<h3>Health Cup Basketball Exhibition Opens - South China Defeats Beller</h3>
<p>The Health Cup Invitational Basketball League, sponsored by the China Health Association, opened at the Beller Court yesterday afternoon. The audience was packed. Chairman of the Association, Lu Ludeng, President Wen Duting, Vice President Lin Kanghou, Ding Fubao, and others attended and presided over the event. Others present included Chen Binhe, Pan Sansheng, Ma Xiangsheng, and others. After Lin Kanghou gave a speech, the performance began. The prelude was a women's performance between Sansheng and Hua Xin. Under the opening ball ceremony of Mr. Pan Sansheng, the competition began. Sansheng won the first game with a score of 1 to 20. In the next game, San San Er lost to Hua Ying with a score of 32 to 45. The main battle was originally between Zhongbei and Hua Yu, but because Zhongbei failed to assemble, Beller was temporarily called to fight. South China defeated Beller with a score of 43 to 36, creating a big upset.</p>
<p>Hua Ying Joins the Battle</p>
<p>The league will continue with the second act today. Due to Hua Ying's request to participate, it has become a gathering of nine heroes. There are two games scheduled for today. The first game is between Hua Ying and Da Hua, and the final game is between Tongren and the Oil Team. Taihua and Yuejian are evenly matched with Hua Ying. Tongren's Yijia has a long history. The Oil Team has new arms. Hua Ying vs. Da Hua at 5:00 pm, Tongren vs. Oil Team at 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>Yesterday's broadcast time was 7:20 pm</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Knowledge Required Under a Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>The Chinese nation has historically centered its economic life on the individual. Therefore, people are unaccustomed to the principle of the state using its power to manage the economy. Upon hearing the word "control," they feel uneasy, even alarmed. When they hear the word "purchase," they are even more dismayed, like startled birds. They fail to realize that purchase is merely one of the many tools used to implement a controlled economy. After purchase, there is rationing. Beyond rationing, there is production.</p>
<p>Haven't we moved beyond this? When analyzing a matter, we must carefully examine the facts and conduct thorough research. We should not make reckless guesses and cause ourselves unnecessary worry. For example, just because the government purchases cotton yarn and cotton cloth, it is assumed that the yarn factories will be unable to spin yarn. Seeing the control of medical supplies, it is assumed that pharmaceutical factories will be unable to produce medicine. Isn't this just self-inflicted trouble? Unless one is ignorant of the facts, one should not imagine things this way. It should be understood that after the control of cotton, the production capacity of yarn factories can be increased. After the control of pharmaceutical raw materials, the production costs of pharmaceutical factories can be reduced.</p>
<p>A controlled economy is adopted during wartime to achieve the goals of the war. Therefore, no country does not adopt a controlled economy during wartime. It can be said that nothing is not under state control. There is production control, sales control, and financial control. The purpose is nothing more than to have the entire nation unanimously abandon its individual freedom and consider the interests of the majority of people in a time of war. Because, "If the skin does not exist, what will the fur cling to?" If there is no water, fish will never survive.</p>

<h3>Securities Exchange to Reopen - Initial Trading of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>The reopening date of the stock exchange has been postponed again. The reason is due to the arrangement of the securities market, registration of brokers, and internal personnel adjustments of the exchange. Now, the preparatory work has been largely completed. If there are no unforeseen events, it is hoped that trading can be reopened in mid-next month. It is also learned that after the reopening of the stock exchange, it has been decided to first trade Chinese stocks. These Chinese stocks are limited to those that have been submitted for approval and have a company registration license. After the opening of trading, all transactions will be conducted with cash and spot goods. Futures trading will not be undertaken for the time being. All transactions will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the "Stock Exchange Law."</p>
<p>Trends in Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially showed a weak trend. This was due to the pressure from sellers seeking to offload their holdings. Around noon, there was a sudden turnaround, and in the afternoon, the upward trend continued, recovering most of the losses from the morning and even rising further. Yong'an Company in the department store industry saw low trading in the morning, but suddenly saw an increase in demand in the afternoon. Xin Xin and Dahuo Company softened in the morning, but in the afternoon, they reversed from a decline to an increase compared to the previous day. Neiyi also rose in the afternoon. Jingfu shirts and socks saw considerable trading, and Jinglun stabilized. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile initially remained flat today, but rose in the afternoon. Dasheng Factories One and Three both declined. Meiya, Tianlun, Xinye, Hongsheng, and Da Zhonghua Weaving initially saw slight declines, but later also rebounded. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Match fluctuated and declined. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and World all declined. Yongxiang saw little trading, and Ge [blank] Weaving. Yangzhun Paper [blank] progressed. Xinye Five [blank], Xinye [blank], and Xinya remained flat. Xinya saw the most trading. Zhongsi, Zhongmo, and Zhongfa all saw small trading. Mingxing Perfume was uniquely stable. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity rose slightly, Huashang [blank] Gas declined slightly, Public [blank] Electric Appliances, Inland Tap Water, Zhongxing Coal Mine, Hanyeping Coal [blank], and Shanghai and Xiangsheng Three [blank] stocks maintained [blank]. Sanyou Baoye. Family Industry rose slightly. China and Huashang Cement both [blank] Tongjin. Real Estate Industry. Xinyi remained flat and weak. Lianhua and Yongxing remained flat. Jiuan Industrial remained small. Xinya Construction remained stable. Baoan Glass and China Investment Association saw little change. Guosan Investment rose on news of a capital increase. Kang [blank] Can Company, Meilin [blank] Head, and Guanshengyuan all maintained their original prices. Standard MSG and Jimei Foods also remained flat. Other stocks also remained stable.</p>
<h3>Imported Materials - Wheat is the Most</h3>
<p>According to a statement by the Materials Movement Permit Office of the Commercial and Trade Council, the most recent controlled import material is wheat from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. The main materials for export are sundries, medicines, etc. According to the permit office, there are 12 types of export items and 2 types of import items. The monthly benchmark quantities for import and export are determined by the Materials Control Deliberation Committee.</p>
<p>Commercial Summary</p>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market was once again uncertain, fluctuating up and down. Generally, people believe that government bonds are better than stocks because stocks are more likely to be subject to control. Therefore, some are abandoning stocks and buying government bonds, but people's opinions are not unanimous. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially rose and then fell, but rebounded slightly higher than before at noon. The trend is still not firm. People are still uneasy.</p>
<p>Call Loan: The interbank call rate of the Money Industry Association is 2.4% per annum.</p>
<p>Few rice and grain shipments arrived. There were sporadic sales. Merchants from other provinces are eagerly seeking to purchase, so people are excited and the market has increased prices across the board. Both japonica rice and paddy rice rose higher than yesterday's market. Baiyuan also followed suit. It is heard that miscellaneous grains such as soybeans and red beans are in a stable situation, with no major price changes. There is little market for the rest.</p>
<p>Tea has been weak for several consecutive days and prices are [blank] soft and weak. Suppliers are still [blank] eager to sell. Buyers are very sluggish, resulting in few transactions and little activity in the market. The total trading volume in the city was 7 dan of black tea, sold by Wuchang Tea Company, designated by Taili Tea Factory. At the same time, [blank] Mao [blank] and Shengtai Tea Companies each imported about 5 dan of green tea, all sold by Yongshun Tea Company.</p>
<p>Activities of Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Silverware Industry: With the approval of the Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare, employees of large and small silverware shops formed the Silverware Industry Vocational H Association. Preparations have been completed and the founding assembly was held at the Cloth Merchants Association at 2:00 pm yesterday. Hundreds of employees and members attended, passed the charter, and elected [blank] Yunfu, Shao Renhe, and others as nine directors, who were immediately sworn in.</p>
<p>Hotel Industry: The Municipal Hotel Industry Association, after being designated by the Management Bureau to appoint Zhang Songzhang and others as organizing committee members, began the reorganization on the 22nd of this month, lasting only one week. It is learned that the inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held this afternoon (29th) at the City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
