<h3 id="c1">總力參戰與物資動員 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>古代戰爭是人力戰，戰爭的決定力量是人數之衆多與戰略的優越，但現代戰爭的內容比較複雜得多。雖然兵員的優勢與卓越的戰略，仍是勝利的主要因素；但同時還必須具備物質上的力量，尤其國民精神和物質的總力，故有「總力戰爭」這個名詞。我們現在參戰，敵方是世界最大的帝國主義國家，最大的工業國家，我們物質上力量如果沒有充分的準備，而僅僅是空喊口號，敵人決不能打倒的。所以「總力參戰」，就不只在於政府的參戰，而且要人民的參戰，不僅是精神的參戰，而且是物質　參戰，只有以國家全部的力量去參戰，才有最後勝利的結果。因此不僅要求人力的動員，而且要求物質的動員。日本在這兩方面的動員工作之步步加强，就可見到其重要性。不過我們有特殊的國情，抄襲與模仿不一定會得同樣的結果。尤其是物資的動員，由於我們社會組織之散漫，與近代工業與運輸機構的不發達，完全的統制與總動員計劃，以及絕對嚴格的動員計劃，不一定會收到效果；而必須適時適地的採取適當的辦法，扶導重於限制造，宣傳重於干涉，然後可求實際的動員效果。</p>
<p>在上述意義之下，我們應該竭力避免以法律的力量，向人民徵發牧資。特別是對於容易毀滅或隱藏的物資，如果採取微發手段，決不會得到理想的結果。所以應由政府以高價徵購爲原則，無論爲土地，糧食，馬匹，車輛以及其他物資，仍當以「勿妄取民間一草一木」爲最高原則。如此人民既無損失，又有愛國之名。不過高價政策，不免刺激物價上漲，並給少數人以厚利，所以採用時不可過於廣泛，非必要時，極不輕易出之。</p>
<p>其次，凡民間可以生產，而產量又相當富裕，除供軍用外，尙有餘額以供民用的物資，政府可以購買方式向人民定購，但生產者須對政府定單儘先交貨，交足以後，始可交付普通定單。此法對於民間生產事業，殊少束縛，比較的可爲動員物資的優良辦法。至於一般必要的物資，特別是商民所有存貨，可由政府主管機關，實行總登記，由政府指定之倉庫保管，旣可防止囤積居奇，又可在必需時由政府以適當的價格微購。</p>
<p>但是不問採取何種方法與步驟，要求動員物資之完善成功，決不能僅僅依靠政府的法令與官員的權威，而必須着重於宣傳解釋和鼓舞的工作。特別是利用民意機關，利用民衆團體，由民間自力進行，所謂「自治的經濟動員　，其要旨即在於此。政府只要處於指導監督的地位，而法令也只須注重於對營私舞弊者加以防制和懲誡。誠能如是，則民間一切心力勞力與物力，皆不慮其隱匿，而自發的集中於政府支配之下，將不限於物資一端，「總力參戰」也就可以「名符其實」了。</p>

<h3 id="c2">大東亞金融體制的強化 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中國聯合準備銀行開業已經五周年了。日本銀行在去年七月二十八日供給中央儲備銀行信用借款一億圓，去年六月十八日供給泰國財政部二億圓，茲又繼之而供給中國聯合準備銀行信用借款二億圓。這具體的表示了大東亞共榮圈中的通貨金融機構，以日本銀行爲中心，而正在整備强化中。</p>
<p>中國聯合準備銀行在民國廿七年創立的時候，正是國際通貨戰爭最激烈的時候。聯銀的創立，克服了重慶及英美方面之執拗的妨害工作，其本身已是極驚異的成就。現在，聯銀券，儲備券與日圓密切的聯繫協力下，已在其各自的分野中種下了堅牢的根。英美曾斷定日本的通貨工作必將失敗，如今見到其根幹的蔓延，將不勝驚異吧！</p>
<p>此次的二億圓，係作替換聯銀創立時由日本有力銀行十五家所借與的一億圓信用借款並加以擴大之用。在確立大東亞金融圈的旣定方針之下？以日本銀行爲中心，而由其單獨供給。</p>
<p>廣域經濟的下層構造，當然是通貨了。通貨方面的建設，强化，不僅在戰爭的現階段爲了必要物資的交流，即在戰事過後的將來，亦有重大的意義。</p>
<p>但廣域經濟的精神，見之於廣域圈內部政治的國境壁壘之撤除，使通貨物資得以自由交流。在各方面進行戰事中的今日，存在着許多障碍，乃是無可避免的。現在東亞共榮圈的內部，通貨，物資並未舒暢地自由交流；那當然，今後自應逐漸向此方面進行。華中華北政治的一元化運動正在進行的時候，並立的聯銀券與儲備券，亟盼其各自在堅實的發育成長之後迅即融合而成爲一元化。（翔：譯自三月十二日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>繼日軍進駐法國租借地廣州灣地區，維希政府聲明撤廢在華治外法權，交還租界行政權之後，最近，在日越關係上，爲適應東亞新事態而於一九四一年成立的日越經濟協定的調整問題，亦已解決，自二月下旬至三月初旬，法國闡明對於軸心國家的協力態度，特別是對大東亞共榮圈具有深切的理解。同時，越南自身對日本亦日見接近。對此動向，當日軍進駐廣州灣時，重慶政權曾向在重慶的法國官昌提出抗議，在維希的重慶外交機關，亦以維希政府的宣言爲藉口，而自法國撤退，對法感情，遂趨惡化。與重慶政權國境相接的越南邊界：當然將趨於緊張。記者爲考察當地的動向，爰巡視越南北境，首先訪問老開的市街。</p>
<p>自河內循滇越鐵道出發，翌日午前五時，抵老開前一站的福木伊站。宿於該站的旅館，去年夏曾被美空軍的空襲，內外兩大門的玻璃盡被震碎，糊着靑色的玻璃紙，站員宿舍的墻壁，也用水泥修理一過，想見當時轟炸之烈，炸彈的碎片，今猶歷歷在目。</p>
<p>滇越鐵道爲援蔣的大動脈，當其運輸能率達最高峯時，每日貨車的行駛達二百數十輛，僅一老開站不足運轉，乃在老開後方二公里地點，闢此新站，以謀運輸上的便利。站內旅館，較河內市的旅館並不稍遜。今見到重慶方面轟炸的殘跡，不勝滄桑之感。</p>
<p>記者抵福木伊站的當天午後，旅館的老者，突然叩門說：「敵人飛機來了！敵人飛機來了！」勸我避入防空壕。在鋼骨水泥的防空壕中，有一隊先前在旅館門前遇到的安南儀仗兵，原擬歡迎該日夕預備在旅館寄宿的頓金州長官愛爾文氏的，亦面露不安之色。敵機向國境的彼方通過後，旅館的法國老者怨恚地跑來說：「什麼事這樣煩！」他的臉上，顯然也浮上了一層敵意。</p>
<p>老開的市街，正當紅河及其支流南溪河的交流點，二河交叉成卍宇形，構成了越南，中國的國境。滇越鐵道在南溪河上架有一百二十公尺長的鐵橋，進入中國的河口，沿這河的溪谷，自蒙自延展至昆明。道鐵橋自日軍進駐北部越南後，即被重慶方面炸斷。現在到越南方面的第一橋脚尙殘存着長約二十公尺的一段，後面的橋樑都生銹而落入河底，立在被破壞的橋頭的一端，對岸蹀　往來的渝軍，灰色的軍服，黃色的臉顏，一切都看得很淸楚。</p>
<p>重慶軍在圍繞河口後方的山獄，築有第一至第四四道陣地，很巧妙地隱蔽於樹木之後，備有迫擊砲，防守的是在雲南的中央軍精銳五十四軍十九師的一部。</p>
<p>在離開百餘公尺的越南方面，每日跋加監視的，是〇〇部隊的軍士及越南軍隊，國境的最前綫，日越合作共同防衛。</p>
<p>經〇〇部隊的特別通融，從雲南逃出來投降的渝軍將校劉大尉（中央軍第五十二軍二十五帥）甘泰兩中尉（雲南一路軍一百八十四師）的口中，我們聽到了在國境那一面的狀况。</p>
<p>渝軍恐懼日軍的進擊，故把滇越鐵道自河口至蒙自間長約百七十七公里的鐵道加以澈底的破壞，蒙自，昆明間四百六十六公里則在中央軍監視之下行駛，但每日亦僅來回一次。至於公路，至昆明的汽車道已加破壞，敵方第一綫與昆明之間的聯絡，自無綫電之外，僅賴徒步及馬匹。快則一月，遲者三月，因而軍隊的糧食漸見不足，現地微發，亦以該地地勢的荒凉，在以前本有賴於越南方面的柿充。故物資不足的程度，至可担憂。</p>
<p>自普通兵士至尉官級將校，每日僅賴少數的玉蜀黍及藷粥充饑，每六日發給每一中隊豬油五斤，溶入野菜中共煮，已算是很快樂的一件事了。因而物價昂貴，越南製的烟草一盒，在河內僅三角五分，越國境即需二十元左右，更至內地則値二十五元。</p>
<p>兵士的俸餉，二等兵八元五角，一等兵九元五角，上等兵十元四角，大尉百六十元，中尉六十元，少尉五十六元。故尉級的軍官都吸不起紙烟。雲南省的中央軍化甚爲激進，以滇越鐵道爲中心的主要部分，全部由中央軍占守，雲南軍僅在鐵道西面的部分。雲南領袖們的軍事權限，今亦被削除，祗有行政權。中央軍的威信大張，但居民與中來軍因言語不通而發生隔閡，則時有所聞</p>
<p>老開正面的中央軍爲第五師及第五十四師，都在華中方面曾與日軍交手，而知道日軍的實力。又蔣介石所視爲精銳的第五軍，亦曾在緬甸戰綫敗北，加以物資的不足和內部的動搖，故一般的鬥志甚爲缺乏。這在蔣自然視爲一件麻煩的事，於是計劃從湖南方面調動軍隊，以期一新該地區的士氣。並擬以昆明爲中心，出動精神總動員隊，灌輸居民的戰時意識，但並沒有什麼效果。</p>
<p>河口的市街，物資感到極端的缺乏，乃與越南方面商量，在日中，自午前八時至十一時，開放至老開的渡頭，使居民得以購買主要食物副食物及食用品。</p>
<p>這三小時的來回，需船資二角，河口的居民，渡南溪河至老開，經越南軍警並稅關加以身體檢査後，以住民證爲質，到街市中購物。每日平均三四百人，其中有百分之八十是女子，購買蔬萊，米等回去。</p>
<p>據越南警官談，日軍轟擊河口後，住民大部分似已减少，留存者多爲貧民，已喪失敵意，但仍驅使其作無益的抗戰。在河的這一面，日越軍共同加以堅固的防衛，老開郊外的鑛區，雖不時聽到敵方的砲聲，仍從容地採掘磷灰石，着着進行產業建設，開採無盡藏的埋藏物，向日本輸出。（翔：譯三月十三日東京朝日新聞越南安蒜特派員十二日發）</p>
<h3 id="c27">泰國經濟槪觀　刷新劇組後成為共榮圈一環 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>泰國的經濟機構之核心爲農業，其次爲林業及礦業。農產品的主要者爲米及橡膠，林產品爲麻栗樹，礦產則以錫爲主。然而在泰國的實業經濟中，有着泰國人自身的主體性的，只不過米的生產一項而已。其他主要實業的生產，差不多全靠外國資本，尤其是靠着英國資本來經營的，即在商業的分野裏，亦爲華僑勢力所獨佔。這是大東亞戰爭以前泰國經濟的全貌。</p>
<p>隨着大東亞戰爭的勃發，泰國即和日本締結攻守同盟，於去年一月二十五日布吿對英美宣戰，完全脫離依存英美的狀態，泰國經濟的面貌，亦爲之一變，全面的由新的角度—即成爲共榮圈的一環—來行其經濟的再組織，日泰間的物資交流，亦得順利進行。通貨的政策，由鎊。美元的聯繫，轉變爲日元的聯繫。財政由平時財政移行於戰時財政。他如經濟統制的强化，國家資本之顯者進步等，均表示着泰國經濟面貌的變化，實爲堪以注目的現象。以下就最近泰國經濟變貌的形跡，爲之一述。</p>
<p>金融　在戰前，泰國紙幣發行的準備金，大半為英美貨幣所佔，這樣的泰國經濟，於大戰勃發同時，遂喪失了鎊·美元的資金，金融界因之而起一時的動搖，存款的提出大增，漸呈惡性通貨膨脹的危險。對於這種狀勢，政府乃極力講求抑制通貨膨脹的手段，施行票據，支票等使用的限制，存款提出的限制等。結果，紙幣的發行額，亦止於三億一千六百萬銖（泰幣）民國三十一年三月底），然而在市中銀行，總存款額减少的背後，反映着由金而向物的移動，漸呈定期存款减退而活期存款增加的傾向，故金融界未必可說是穩定的。</p>
<p>然而在另一方面，根據日泰經濟協定，成立了日元與泰幣的等價關係。因之銖與鎊的聯繫，急速地轉變爲與日元的聯繫。同時，泰國因着日泰借款的成立，獲得了二億日元的借款，紙幣發行準備金，亦因加入國內金準備一億三千萬銖，而增爲三億三千萬銖，對於紙幣的發行額，得到了百分之百的準備率。更因把大東亞共榮圈對外決算通貨之特別元作爲其準備金，而得確保銖的對外價値的安定。然而尙未至改變換物傾向，此外更有政府之財政支出的增加，以成隨着海外貿易的斷絕而起之交易量的激减，還有因着水害所遭之產業打擊等，所以泰國金融經濟的前途，尙未許樂觀。可是泰國經濟雖遭遇到未曾有的激變期，而金融界的推移，一般說來。却是比較平靜的。這是多靠泰國政府處理金融政策的適切，對於金融機構的整備會爲了很大的努力之賜吧。</p>
<p>槪觀泰國的金融政策，政府首先實施存款提出的限制，以抑制通貨的膨脹，繼又施行新通貨滙兌統制法（去年二月一日），明白表示與金鎊聯繫脫離關係，停止金鎊與泰幣的兌換，採用滙兌許可制，極力講求防止華僑等匯款流出海外等的手段。</p>
<p>泰國政府一邊那樣地由通貨方面採用對內及對外安定貨幣價値的政策，一邊復努力於金融機構的整備。首先値得注目的，乃是中央銀行法的公布。中央銀行法係於去年五月五日公布的，同年十二月十日根據該法而設立泰國銀行（資本金二千萬），賦與純然的中央銀行的職能。由於該行的設立，金融界的統一更爲强化，其將來的活躍，殊可期待。此外更在各地組織貯蓄組合，又於去年六月設立國營的泰國人壽保險公司，由着此等手段，努力以吸收過剩的購買力。他方面更在各府縣增設信用組合，以謀農業金融的充實。</p>
<p>財政　隨着泰国經濟之進入戰時體制的階段，在財政的支出中，軍事費亦見顯著增大。即在一九四二年度，關防於國費一項，經常及特別支出合計達一億一百六十萬銖，佔歲出總預算的四一·六％，其次爲實業建設資金（一億二千一百萬銖）的顯著增加，亦堪注目。</p>
<p>此外，如中央銀行設立資金，橡膠公司及錫產公司之政府資金等，一般關於促進實業的支出頗多，足以窺見今後泰國政府之方向。</p>
<p>至於歲入方面，雖亦漸見增加，然仍不免不足，這個不足，雖想從米穀交易稅，直接稅，間接稅，公企業收入之自然增收等來彌補之意，然而結果却擬由國家公債的發行和地方建設公債一百十七萬七千銖以及建設公債發行權六千萬銖的獲得而爲彌補，國家公債預定由中央銀行承受，然因未見設立之故，暫定的辦法，是向市中銀行借款及向國庫局貨幣課暫借以充當之。這個結果，不免招致政府紙幣的增發，然而政府爲避免通貨膨脹起見，現正努力於金融機關的整備與生產的增强，以及物價統制政策的確立。</p>
<p>物價統制　關於物價統制，已施行統制物價法及日用品與食品統制令。由於前者，乃在中央設立中央委員會，於各縣設立地方委員會，地方委員會受中央委員會的指揮監督。委員會規定統制物資及其種類，有執行調查，分配，公定價格的權限。又後者賦與關於日用品及食品交易的統制，物品的分配，最高價格的決定，存貨的調査等廣泛的權限。然由委員會設定之公定價格，因爲沒有考慮到實際市價之故，致市塲價格和公定價格相差很遠，因此暗市交易橫行，有助長物價騰貴的傾向。去年八月，廢除日用品及食品的公定價格，由業者自定之公平的價格爲據，僅對於糖，肥皂，衣料，鐵釘，藥品等重要商品十九種，重新公定價格，同時修正該項法令，强化違反罰則，制定死刑及無期微役等的嚴刑。在戰前，輸入品的數量，約當總生產額的二五％，戰爭勃發之後，即吿杜絕。因此之故，泰國經濟就有物價騰貴之必然的傾向。然而雖有這種的變革期，可是物價則已漸見安定，這原因除泰國政府之適切的措置外，亦由於日本物資之漸次增加於泰國市塲之故。總之，泰國是痛感着一方有須急圖日泰經濟關係的緊密化，一方有須急圖開發自國實業之須要。最近把如何由農業國轉向輕工業國一事之作爲問題，正是表現政府之這種政策的，殊堪注目。</p>
<p>實業政策　在大戰勃發之後，泰國政府之經濟政策的主要目標，於其宣戰布吿直接的聲明中，亦可明白。乃是要驅逐從來的外國資本，由泰國自身的經濟力來運營。因此其第一步着手的事，就是經濟機構的整備。政府以去年二月十七日國務院的布吿，設立建設工業委員會，更把它分成肥皂，鍊鋼，製陶等七個小委員會，又於去年四月設立執行工業委員會。到了同年九月，復把兩委員會合併，改組爲國家工業委員會。該委員會的計畫案中，計畫設立中央工業公司，使成爲對於一般之投資公司。又計畫增設陶器工廠，紡績工廠，日用品工廠等。總之那個實業計畫，指示出泰國之緊急的必要物資，是以糖（四萬公噸），綿布（二千萬銖），礦油（一億二千公升，）以及其他烟草，火柴，肥皂，化學藥品等爲主的輕工業品。政府首先着重於搪，棉作的增產，計畫於本年四月，把從來的甘蔗種植面積五萬拉伊產糖二萬二千公噸加以擴大，而成立了糖的增產計畫，在泰國的東北部增設國營精糖工廠，以謀生產的擴充。關於棉作的獎勵，政府已自前年起，於泰國北部選定十五縣，努力於棉作的獎勵，並設立了紡綿工廠二所。一九四一年一月至九月之間，產棉共達十萬担，其二五％供國內消費，二五％供泰國紡積業使用，餘下的五〇％已全部輸出。棉作的種植面積，亦因政府的獎勵結果，漸在增加之中。烟草從來爲英美烟草所壓倒，國內的煙草事業，殊形不振，然政府於一九三九年公布烟草統制法，翌年收買英美茶的烟草工廠，改爲國營，於是泰國的烟草製造事業，遂爲政府所獨佔。火柴在戰前略呈自給自足的狀態，但在戰爭勃發之後，由於藥品輸人斷絕，一時曾感不足。這樣，政府一面謀生活必需品的增產，一面把全國的主要工廠置於軍管理之下，以謀戰時下重要實業的生產擴充。更於同年六月舉行國家實業會議，詳細協議關於家庭工業的獎勵，林業及礦業之開發促進等。政府之意，在於把此等重要實業悉歸國營，把外國資本完全驅逐，因此發表了泰國錫礦橡膠公司（資本金五千萬銖）及木材公司（資本金二千五百萬銖）的設立。政府在該二公司裏，投入了二五％的資本，均爲繼承英國系的沒收財產而經營者，其業務早已開始。此外農業政策之堪以注目者，厥爲合作社的設立，此種合作社，概由政府資金以設立之。設立這種合作社的本意，在於期能確立泰人爲主的農村經濟，同時並謀排除中間商人之華僑的勢力，故其今後的動向，大可注目。更爲整備配給機構起見，已有設立國內物產公司之議，目下正在進行中。</p>
<p>以一已把泰國經濟作了一個槪觀，其足以使人注目的，乃是日泰經濟關係在大戰勃發之後益趨緊密。同時泰國的米，錫，橡膠等的重要物資，與日本之織維製品的交流，亦見順利推移。一方面國家資本的進出，代替了沒落的英系資本。然而本來缺乏國民資本的蓄積之泰國，華僑的經濟勢力現尙居於支配的狀况，考慮到這一點時，則泰國之成爲東亞共榮圈一環的經濟發展，似尙有幾多施策的必要。（丁：譯自三十二年二月「本邦財政情勢」）</p>

<p>華中棉花統制會近爲救濟內地棉農生活深受投機商人威脅起見，擬將棉紗，棉布，及其他生活必需品，以公定價格，大量配給，以安定其生活，並期棉花收買數量之增大。棉紗，棉布可於本月中旬裝運配給於江北及其他棉產區域，至香烟，火柴，臘燭，肥皂，及砂糖等五洋貨品，亦當自下月起逐步實施配給。該會爲防止居間商之壟斷起見，並令其各地下屬機構，當在各地收買棉花時，除用現款支付代價外，並視棉花數量，給與棉紗棉布及其他生活必需品之交換券。棉農可移交換券並附現軟向必需品交換所，按公定價格，購領配給物資。</p>
<p>上述辦法若能圓滑進行，則其結果之圓滿，可操左券，舉要言之，約有五端：</p>
<p>（一）農民生活安定，將努力生產食糧與工業原料，以供給城市。</p>
<p>（二）城市居民以食糧與工業原料源源而來，其生活亦得安定。</p>
<p>（三）上海紡織業以原料有來源出品有銷路，自將踏上復興之大道，而其他工業亦將連帶地附驥尾而復興。</p>
<p>（四）城市能以低廉工業品供給農村，則農村自亦能以低廉農產品供給城市；工業品與農產品便格之高低，有互爲因果之密切關係；今上海方面能毅然決然先以低廉工業品供給農村，則農村自亦願以低廉農產品供給上海；原料低廉，成本下降，則此後上海工業品之價格自更必低廉。</p>
<p>（五）主要工業品與農產品價格低平之後，則大勢所趨，非主要品之價格亦將低平，則囤戶心虛，相率出籠，一般物價均將低平，而幣値得維持上漲矣。或謂如此一來，則囤戶將虧累不堪，此似是而非之論也，蓋囤貨雖跌價而囤戶生活用品亦無不跌價，何損之有哉？反言之，囤貨雖漲價，而囤戶生活用品亦無不漲價，亦何益之有哉？損人而並不利已，何其愚也！</p>

<p>國民歡府茲已決定設立全國商業統制總會，以爲華中方面物資收買配給的中央統制機關，並與日本方面混合設立物資統制審議會，爲其諮詢機關同時，修正現行的揚子江下流地區物資移動取締暫行規程，事實上撤廢了和平地區內物資移動的限制。這措置乃是爲了當地軍作戰上的目的而加以實施的，大東亞戰爭開始後更加强化的華中經濟封鎖政策，至此乃有劃時期的轉變。國府參戰之後，結集日華經濟總力的新方策，首先在物資的收買配一給部門上具體實現，由此，國一府對華中的物資，始整備了一元的且自主的統制機構。國府的實力强化後，對遂行大東亞戰爭上經濟方面的期望，能獲何種效果，有待於新機構今後的運營如何？像這種物資統制機構的計劃，業經試騐，証明其對華中經濟的振興，貢獻極大。</p>
<p>原來在國府參戰之前幾月；當去年秋季內地農產物的收穫期，關於華中經濟政策上的封鎖經濟，曾加以反省。十月的開放淮河，及蚌埠設立的日華收買雜糧的共同委員會成功後，關於物資的收買配給，主張適應當地的實際情况，並儘量利用當地中國人的資本與能力，這種見解，在華中經濟界漸見抬頭，糧食管理委員會之因國府改革行政機構而昇格獨立爲糧食部，其目的也不僅在於確保糧食，且使中國方面得以積極的參加物資收買，與增產並進，使物資的交流趨於圓活，並加强上海的工業生產力與內地農業生產力的聯繫，庶儲備券的價値有維持可能，而燃眉之急的華中物價對策，也將賴此促進。</p>
<p>物資統制審議會的組織，有中國財界人士參加，希望上海財界與國府的關係發生更密切的聯繫。他們所主張的「日華分工合作」而結合二國經濟力的理想，首先在商業部門上具體實現，故對於今後日華經濟關係的展開，實寄與極大的期望。（翔：譯自三月十三日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>華北開發公司總裁津島壽一氏，爲視察華中經濟狀况來寗，十七日下午六時三十分，在石波公館接見新聞記者，暢談訪寗目的與華北開發狀况，略謂本人數度去滬，但南京尙爲初次，者番來京，深感參戰下之首都，生氣蓬勃，本人久欲到京向在主席暨國府諸要人，畑大將閣下及軍事當局致敬，但因就任華北開發公司總裁後事務過多，至今日始能如願，會晤至友石渡顧問與上海財界人士，藉聆此間情形，以期與華北之開發政策調和，今次來京，非爲何種具體問題，旨在考察情勢，謀南北之交流，本人與新任華中振興公司總裁高島氏交誼甚深，惜因時日關係不及晤面，華北方面開發工作，進行順利，又因大東亞戰爭之進展，復有中國之參戰，華北已成後方兵站根據地，故其地位倍加重要，關係事業公司亦不斷努力，因之本年度之預算，更將增加若干，擬返日一行與中央當局折衝此事，在具體上因物資動員計劃未定，故不能言其詳，總之注重於煤斤食鹽，鐵類之開發與增產。</p>
<p>今後之最大問題，即爲大陸各地之物資交流，大陸之發展，必須提供物資以副日本之期望，即中國本身，自從參戰後，亦須謀其產業經濟之發展，故各地物資須求其合理之交流，以資培養戰力，余意一切物資之就地生產，就地供給，乃大陸經濟發展之唯一良策，今次中國之參戰，實爲解決此項問題，推進經濟發展之絕好機會，尙望以誠意决心以赴。</p>
<p>國策公司之調整問題，各方頗多議論，但爲期各公司之今後發展，尙有二大問題不得不加以考慮，即資本的構成與人事的構成，本年年初，將軍管理之五大煤鑛打成一片，改組爲中國法人公司，社長以下全部董監事統由華人担任，成績極爲圓滿，相信此種現象對於今後推進中日合作事業，必有良好印象，同時日本轉變對華政策中國之發展，必能因之而速。</p>
<p>最近華北聯銀與日本銀行締結二萬萬圓借款，此舉對於華北經濟界之影響甚好，促進資金之調度與其運用，對推進金融工作上，相信其貢獻匪鮮。（雲鵬：譯自三月十八日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c62">別怕孤獨！ <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 志彥</p>
<p>當您為某種真理而奮鬥，結果不幸失敗，就會有許多人投到您的反對者的旗幟之下，跟您疏遠或竟向您謾駡，於是一種孤獨的恐懼就很快地在您心中滋生。可是，在這種情况下，千萬別怕孤獨！您得繼續守護真理，繼續努力奮鬥。</p>
<p>亦許您以為：許多人都在反對真理，光靠一個人守護努力又有什麽用呢？您得知道，許多人的反對，總不出兩種原因：或許是為了他們有着趨炎附勢的本能。或許是為了他們抱着隨聲附和的態度。</p>
<p>趨炎附勢可說是社會中大部分人的本能，他們對於人生根本談不上認識，祇要有人在名或利上得手一點，他們就會對他捧上一頓，您的奮鬥旣遭失敗，您的聲勢當然比不上您的反對者來得煊赫，於是為着自己的利益勢必要去捧上一番：本來，世態炎凉古今同理，可是要知道他們所趨的炎所附的勢難免總有衰敗的一天。</p>
<p>亦有人在本心上並沒有趨炎附勢的傾向，但抱着隨聲附和的態度，混雜的社會環境使他們養成了一種不做「　大」（？）的「應聲虫」脾氣，這種脾氣與其說是圆滑母寗說是懦怯。遇到任何事情時，他們總這末想：「大家都這樣做我當然亦這樣做」或是「大家呌我這樣做我就祇好這樣做了」。第一種見解十足地表現出應聲虫的面目，他們喪失了自己的意志。第二種見解更顯出了懦怯無能。</p>
<p>的確，無意識的孤獨是不需要的，可是祇要您認淸了目標，為了真理而遭受孤獨却是決不可怕的。您當然不願像許多人一樣地去趨炎附勢，亦不願隨聲附和，那末因此而致孤獨亦是有意義有價值的；而且倘使您真正為真理而奮鬥，即使是那些為了趨炎附勢隨聲附和而遠離您的人們，祇要他們還沒有完全喪失靈魂，他們內心亦始終會欽佩您的。</p>
<p>易卜生在他「國民公敵」一劇中說：「世界上最强有力的人就是那最孤獨的人」，別怕孤獨！祗要您始終不離真理而不斷地去奮鬥。您必須堅信：您始終是個强有力者，最後的勝利必定會來臨到您身旁的</p>
<h3 id="c63">蘇格拉底遺言 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 維柴夫</p>
<p>希臘哲學之始祖蘇格拉底在他被判服毒藥而死之後，臨終前的一分種內，他給活着的人二句遺言，</p>
<p>「說了就做，光是熱烈的宣言是無益處的！」</p>
<p>「我欠阿斯克利辟亞斯一只雄雞，你（在他床邊的朋友克列多）能不能記着去還這個債」</p>
<p>第一句是充分貫教他「言行合一」的一句話，他看穿了世人的只說不做，在人面前說得轟轟烈烈，但背轉了身完全似乎沒有那回事似的，他知道如果每一個人能把說到的全做到，世界已不是那樣糟了。</p>
<p>第二句話，似乎有些滑稽，臨死却把欠人家一只雄雞看得如此嚴重，但是這裏面是存在着真理的。</p>
<p>大哲學家的死，遺憾一件小工作的未了，我們普通人呢？未了的工作，不止只有一隻公雞吧！所以普通人往往在臨終時，話竟多得不知說那一句好。原因是應了未了的事太多</p>
<p>他的啟示，「說了就做，把你欠的債還淸！」</p>
<h3 id="c64">充實自己 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 正</p>
<p>世界上不知有多少職業者在整日整夜地想着；怎樣去討上司的喜悅？使自己的位置得以升遷或穩固。因此便常常盡量的脧削了自己而甘心地去獻媚；同時同事之間也就會常常發生出爭奪的傾軋。</p>
<p>怎樣才是擢升或保住職位的方法呢？其實這事並不難做，而只要你盡力去設法使自己成為一個有能力有價值的人；使自己的才能足以勝任自己的職位，那末雖然不去向人家殷勤獻媚，別人也自然會賞識你和畏敬你的。因為一切的事務必須要有才幹的人方能處置得井然有條而有發展的希望。反之，若是單用了獻媚的手段去得到了優越的地位，自己的才能卻不能勝任，到後來非但精神感到苦悶，並且結果終免不了遜位的一天。</p>
<p>所以一個有志向上的聰明的職業者，他奮鬥的方法，必定是着重於怎樣充實自己的一方面的。</p>
<h3 id="c65">為人 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>

<p>別人是獨眼，你不妨看他的半面。是聾子，就不要同他滔滔不絕的高聲談話。是啞子則不要同他辯論。每一個人當在自己身上造一個深大的墳墓，把朋友的缺點和過失埋葬。</p>
<p>你的「手」可以粗糙一點，污穢齷齪全不妨，但心地應永遠點塵不沾。</p>
<p>勸你不要太憂慮了，世上有許多憂慮是多餘的，且是有害的。</p>

<p>兪篤周復了原位，便是楊子傑和根明也復了原位。</p>
<p>「這樣吧；」兪篤周給有功來一鬧，却鬧出了一個意見，「就寫「死頭活尾巴」吧，三年之後，才可以回頭。田價吧，自然應該多些。」</p>
<p>「怎麽樣，老根？」楊子傑覺得這亦是一個辦法，看了根明問。</p>
<p>「就，就，就死頭活尾巴吧。」根明遲遲地答應了，實在到此地步，他已不能不答應。</p>
<p>楊子傑走到黃崇菴的身邊，切切地講了好一會。黃崇菴一會搖搖頭，一會點點頭，表示着他的意見。</p>
<p>「就這樣，可好？」楊子傑的腰彎了好一刻，趕緊直了起來，低聲問。</p>
<p>「唔。」就只有這樣一聲的答覆。</p>
<p>楊子傑連忙興忽忽地走過來，對根明說：「好容易，向黃老爺說之再三，黃老爺才答應：死頭活尾巴，作價六十五元。你再要不肯，那我就不管了。」</p>
<p>「就算七十元吧」根明還在掙扎。</p>
<p>「不成不成！」</p>
<p>又入了爭多論少的相持局面。爭論了好久，結果是六十七元，其中的確累楊子傑在炕床與賬桌之間，往返了好幾次。</p>
<p>兪篤周的筆，重新寫上了桑皮紙，片刻之後，就寫到了「計開。」根明從襯衫袋裏，手抖抖地取出一個紙包，在桌面上打了開來，兪篤周按着紙包中的每一張單據，將應抄的都抄入了，然後再寫下去。（十五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Total War and Resource Mobilization <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Ancient warfare was a war of manpower, where the decisive forces were the size of the army and the superiority of strategy. However, modern warfare is much more complex. While the advantage in troops and excellent strategy are still the main factors for victory, it is also necessary to have material strength, especially the collective strength of national spirit and resources. Hence the term "total war." We are now participating in the war, and the enemy is the world's largest imperialist country, the largest industrial country. If we do not have adequate material preparation, but only shout slogans, we will never defeat the enemy. Therefore, "total war" means not only the government's participation in the war, but also the people's participation. It is not only spiritual participation but also material participation. Only by using the full power of the country to participate in the war can we achieve ultimate victory. Therefore, it requires not only the mobilization of manpower but also the mobilization of materials. Japan's gradual strengthening of mobilization work in these two areas shows its importance. However, we have a unique national situation, and copying and imitating may not yield the same results. Especially in the mobilization of resources, due to the loose organization of our society and the underdevelopment of modern industry and transportation, complete control and general mobilization plans, as well as absolutely strict mobilization plans, may not be effective. Instead, we must take appropriate measures at the right time and place, emphasize guidance over restriction, and promotion over intervention, to achieve effective mobilization.</p>
<p>In the above sense, we should strive to avoid using legal power to requisition materials from the people. Especially for materials that are easily destroyed or hidden, requisitioning will not achieve the desired results. Therefore, the government should adopt the principle of purchasing at high prices. Whether it is land, food, horses, vehicles, or other materials, the highest principle should still be "do not recklessly take even a single blade of grass or a single tree from the people." In this way, the people will have no loss and will have a reputation for patriotism. However, the high-price policy inevitably stimulates price increases and gives huge profits to a few people, so it should not be used too widely, and should not be used lightly unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Secondly, for materials that can be produced by the private sector and are relatively abundant, with a surplus for civilian use in addition to military use, the government can order them from the people through purchases. However, producers must prioritize fulfilling government orders and only deliver ordinary orders after fulfilling them. This method imposes very little restriction on private production and is a relatively good way to mobilize resources. As for general necessities, especially the inventories owned by merchants, the government authorities can conduct a general registration and store them in warehouses designated by the government, which can prevent hoarding and speculation, and can be requisitioned by the government at an appropriate price when necessary.</p>
<p>However, no matter what methods and steps are taken, to achieve complete success in mobilizing resources, we cannot rely solely on government laws and the authority of officials. Instead, we must focus on the work of publicity, explanation, and encouragement. In particular, we must use public opinion organs and mass organizations to carry out the work independently. The essence of "autonomous economic mobilization" lies in this. The government only needs to be in a position of guidance and supervision, and the laws only need to focus on preventing and punishing those who engage in private gain and malpractice. If this can be achieved, all the people's efforts, labor, and materials will not be hidden, but will be spontaneously concentrated under the government's control. This will not be limited to materials alone, and "total war" can then be "true to its name."</p>

<h3 id="e2">Strengthening the Greater East Asia Financial System <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of China has been in operation for five years. The Bank of Japan provided the Central Reserve Bank with a credit loan of 100 million yen on July 28th of last year, and the Ministry of Finance of Thailand with 200 million yen on June 18th of last year. Now, it has followed up by providing the Federal Reserve Bank of China with a credit loan of 200 million yen. This concretely demonstrates that the currency and financial institutions in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the Bank of Japan as the center, are being organized and strengthened.</p>
<p>When the Federal Reserve Bank of China was established in 1938, it was the time of the most intense international currency war. The establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank overcame the stubborn obstruction of Chongqing, Britain, and the United States, and its very existence is an astounding achievement. Now, the Federal Reserve Bank notes, reserve notes, and Japanese yen are closely linked and cooperating, and have taken firm root in their respective fields. Britain and the United States once asserted that Japan's currency work would surely fail, but now that they see the spread of its roots, they will be amazed!</p>
<p>The 200 million yen this time is used to replace and expand the credit loan of 100 million yen originally lent by fifteen powerful Japanese banks when the Federal Reserve Bank of China was established. Under the established policy of establishing the Greater East Asia Financial Sphere, the Bank of Japan will be at the center, providing it solely.</p>
<p>The lower-level structure of a wide-area economy is, of course, currency. The construction and strengthening of currency is not only necessary for the exchange of essential materials in the current stage of the war, but also has significant implications for the future after the war.</p>
<p>However, the spirit of a wide-area economy is manifested in the removal of political national border barriers within the wide-area sphere, allowing currency and materials to flow freely. In today's situation where war is being waged in various fields, the existence of many obstacles is unavoidable. At present, currency and materials are not flowing freely within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Naturally, we should gradually move in this direction in the future. At a time when the movement towards political unification of Central and Northern China is underway, the coexisting Federal Reserve Bank notes and reserve notes are eagerly awaiting their rapid integration into a unified currency after their solid growth and development.

<p>Tokyo, 18th, Domei News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4 PM today that Japanese naval aircraft attacked Darwin Harbor on the 15th of this month, heavily damaging its military facilities. At the same time, they engaged with more than 30 enemy aircraft, shooting down 16 of them. One Japanese aircraft did not return. From the 6th to the 11th of this month, the Japanese Navy sank 6 enemy submarines. The Japanese side had two merchant ships sunk.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Domei News Agency: The Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced today that Japanese naval aircraft again attacked Milne Bay on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea yesterday.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th, Central News Agency: According to Australian broadcasts regarding the bombing of Darwin by Japanese aircraft on the 15th, the Japanese aircraft attacked Darwin close to noon on the 15th. This was the most intense bombing in the past few months. The commander of the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific, Macarthur, has repeatedly warned the Australian people about the power of the Japanese Air Force, and the bombing of Darwin is a demonstration of this fact.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Naval Air Force launched a large-scale air raid on Darwin Harbor, an enemy military base in northwestern Australia, during the daytime on the 15th. The intensity of the Japanese aircraft's attack was said by Australian broadcasting stations to be unprecedented in recent months, so it is not difficult to imagine the severity of the damage. The enemy forces are attempting a counterattack, and have recently been actively increasing the number of aircraft sent to Port Moresby and Guadalcanal Island in the eastern South Pacific, intending to use these as forward bases. Their fierce battles with Japanese aircraft day and night are well known to the world. However, the enemy forces have recently been more actively strengthening various combat capabilities in the Darwin Harbor area, preparing for a counterattack. To preempt this, the Japanese Naval Air Force, on the morning of the 15th, launched a joint large formation of attack aircraft and fighters, penetrating the skies over Darwin Harbor one after another, dropping bombs like rain under close coordination. A large number of oil depots caught fire from the hits, and all harbor facilities were destroyed. The enemy's British and American joint fighter squadrons, seeing that the situation at the airfield was also critical, rose to meet them. More than 30 enemy aircraft of the Spitfire and P40 (Kittyhawk) types began to engage with the Japanese fighter squadrons. The Japanese attack aircraft squadrons also fiercely attacked more than a dozen enemy fighters. A fierce aerial battle immediately unfolded. As a result of the Japanese fighters' valiant efforts, 15 enemy aircraft were shot down. The attack aircraft squadrons also shot down one enemy Spitfire aircraft. Only one Japanese aircraft has not yet returned. As a result of this battle, the enemy's counterattack posture suffered a major setback.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Manchukuo Reforms Administrative Structure, Revamps Police Administration, Strengthens National Defense <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 18th, Central News Agency: The Manchukuo government, in order to strengthen the domestic decisive battle system, has decided to reform the internal structure of the government. After many days of research, all preparations have been completed. It was finally decided at the Senate Council meeting on the 18th, and all procedures have been completed. It will be implemented from April 1st. The main points of this administrative structure reform are as follows: (1) Establish a Ministry of Education and Culture to oversee education, religion, moral instruction, customs, arts, culture, sports, and other matters related to people's livelihood, as well as the artistic administration under the Public Information Office of the General Affairs Agency, to promote education and culture. (2) Establish a Police General Bureau to separate the police administration under the Department of Security and change it into an external bureau of the General Affairs Agency, in order to enrich the police organization and unify the administrative and police affairs. (3) The Department of Military Affairs and the Department of Security will be renamed the Department of Military Affairs, which will be in charge of national defense, military administration, and other purely national defense matters, in order to make the Manchukuo defense at the present time more and more substantial.</p>
<p>Beijing, 18th, Central News Agency: The Manchukuo government authorities recently issued a statement explaining the reasons for this administrative structure reform. The statement said that when the government is implementing the second phase of construction work, in order to revitalize the people's administration and build a highly national defense state, it believes that it is necessary to make some reforms to the current administrative structure. Therefore, it has taken this measure based on the outline of the basic national policy. In order to revitalize culture and education, the Education Division and the Welfare Division are separated from the Department of Civil Affairs to establish a Ministry of Education and Culture. Since the promulgation of the National Military Law in the seventh year of Kangde, the foundation of the National Army has been established, and the importance of military administration has become increasingly important. Therefore, in order to adapt to the progress of our country's politics and to coordinate police administration with the general situation, it is an urgent task at present. Therefore, the Police Division is separated from the Department of Security, and the Department of Security is renamed the Department of Military Affairs, which specializes in military affairs. A Police Bureau is added to the General Affairs Agency to take charge of police affairs, in order to strengthen the relationship between police administration and various administrative departments. It is firmly believed that the implementation of our country's administration will be more and more smooth as a result of this reform.</p>
<p>Takasaki Appointed Economic Advisor</p>
<p>Changchun, 17th, Havas News Agency: The "Manchukuo Daily" reported that the Manchukuo government has appointed Takasaki, chairman of the Manchukuo Industrial Development Corporation, as the government's economic advisor. According to the government, there are four economic advisors, the other three being Omura, president of the South Manchuria Railway Company, Kamagawa, former chairman of the Manchukuo Industrial Development Corporation, and Okada, president of the Manchukuo Industrial Bank. The Manchukuo Industrial Development Corporation controls various heavy industries in the country, so Takasaki's appointment as economic advisor this time is the most appropriate. In the future, he will surely be able to promote various economic measures.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Burmese Chief Executive Invited to Japan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: Among the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, a strong system centered on Japan is now being established, gathering the total power of China, Manchukuo, Thailand, etc., laying the foundation for the formation of a large ethnic group in Greater East Asia. Burma, as a powerful wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has always actively cooperated with Japan. In his policy speech at the Diet meeting on January 28th of this year, Prime Minister Tojo has already recognized that "Burma will become independent within the year." At the invitation of the Japanese government, Burmese Chief Executive Ba Maw, along with Minister of Home Affairs Dakin Miya, Minister of Finance Dai Ying Mo, and Commander of the Burmese Defense Army Major General Aung San, broke through the 5,300-kilometer air route and arrived safely at Haneda Airport at 1:00 PM today. Yamamoto of the "Greater East Asia Ministry," Matsumoto of the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," Tominaga of the "Army Ministry," and Sawamoto, the Vice Ministers of the "Navy Ministry," and Takeuchi, Director-General of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and many other officials and civilians welcomed them at the scene. Chief Executive Ba Maw and his entourage immediately took a car from Haneda Airport to the annex of the official residence of the capital, Hiro-cho, to rest.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 18th, Central News Agency: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Burmese were most cooperative with the Japanese army in combat. After the Japanese army settled Burma, the Burmese once again directly and indirectly cooperated with the Japanese military administration in restoring and building Burma, and increasing the Japanese military's combat power. Moreover, Burma is the richest place for rice production in the South, so that the Japanese army has no worries about the rear in combat, and supplies rice to Japan, Java, and other places. In addition, it also supplies green vegetables, cattle, pigs, chickens, eggs, fruits, etc. From this, it can be seen that Burma has sufficient self-sufficiency in food and even has a surplus. This kind of food self-sufficiency system constitutes a major driving force for the Japanese army in the bordering areas where the Japanese army and the Chongqing, British, and American armies are confronting each other, laying a major foundation for maintaining治安, and becoming a major element in strengthening Burma's defense system. In addition, Burma is rich in timber, which can be used to build wooden boats, which also occupies an important position in increasing ships.</p>

Mr. Tsushima is currently touring Central China, preparing to inspect the industrial and commercial centers there, and to hold talks with the Japanese military authorities, as well as government officials and industrial leaders. He stated that among North China's resources, special attention should be paid to coal and iron, because the two are very important for the production of military supplies, and the company's activities will be particularly focused on this. Tsushima also said that there is another important issue, namely the smooth distribution of materials between various regions of China and the supply of materials to Japan. He said that the organized distribution of materials is the main factor in stabilizing the wartime industrial structure, and that the production and supply of materials are the most important methods for developing China's economic structure, and that the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War will give China a great opportunity to achieve this goal. The current problem is the harmonious unity and close cooperation between China and Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Increasingly Declining Chongqing Army's Organization and Deployment <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army's spring offensive in the Central China area has dealt fatal blows to the Chongqing forces in the Sixth War Area ("Hubei Front"), the "Ninth War Area" (near Nanchang), and the "Lu-Su War Area" ("Su-Huai Front"). However, the Chongqing side still possesses several hundred divisions, totaling approximately three million troops. Acting as a link in the anti-Axis camp and willingly serving as traitors in East Asia, they continue their blind resistance. Their operational foundation lies in dividing defense areas into combined warfare zones, forming strategic unit groups. Under the "War Area Commander," command is delegated to "Army Groups, Armies, and Divisions." The following briefly describes the organization and troop deployment of the Chongqing forces in each war area to illustrate the foolishness of their struggle, which can only lead to decline. "First War Area," Commander-in-Chief Jiang Dingwen, with Tang Enbo as his deputy, has a total strength of forty divisions. Among them, approximately twenty divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. They are entrenched in southwestern Shanxi and the mountainous areas of Henan. During the Central Plains Campaign, they suffered heavy blows from the Japanese army and sustained severe damage. "Second War Area" encompasses various regions in northern Shanxi. "Commander-in-Chief" Yan Xishan, "Deputy Commander-in-Chief" Yang Aiyuan. "Third War Area" is centered around the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, including the four provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. They suffered a severe defeat by the Japanese army during the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign last May. Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Shizun, with a total strength of thirty divisions, half of which are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. The Fourth War Area governs the entire province of Guangxi, Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui, with a total strength of only six Guangxi divisions. Since the Japanese army occupied the French concession of Guangzhou Bay, Zhang Fakui's attempt to use his position as front-line commander to seize Guangzhou Bay has been foiled. The Fifth War Area includes southern Henan, northern Hubei, and western Anhui, Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren, with Sun Lianzhong as his deputy, has a total strength of thirty-two divisions, but only four divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. The Sixth War Area governs the western part of Hubei province, along the Yangtze River, serving as a barrier to Chongqing, Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wu Qihui, with a total strength of twenty-six divisions, of which approximately twenty divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. Although Chen Cheng once proclaimed that he would retake Yichang, he has suffered heavy blows from the Japanese army in Central China and sustained significant damage. The Seventh War Area is limited to Guangdong province, Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai, with a total strength of fifteen divisions, all of which are Guangdong troops. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou Bay, Yu Hanmou's troops in the vicinity have been cleared out. The Eighth War Area spans the three northwestern provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, Commander-in-Chief Zhu Shaoliang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, with a total strength of fifty divisions, of which fifteen divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. It is reported that a portion of them has been stationed in Xinjiang. The Ninth War Area encompasses Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Yang Sen, with a total strength of thirty divisions, of which fifteen divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. In addition, a Tenth War Area was established in Yunnan province at the end of last year, with Guan Linzheng rumored to be the Commander-in-Chief. Furthermore, there is a special war area, the Lu-Su War Area, which is a corner in the middle of the Lu-Su Peace Zone, where the Chongqing army is recklessly active, Commander-in-Chief Yu Xuezhong, Deputy Commander Han Deqin, with a total strength of ten regiments, of which only one division is directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. Since generals such as Wu Huawen, Li Wenli, and Li Yingping successively pledged allegiance to the "He Yun" (likely referring to a collaborationist movement), the strength of this war area has significantly diminished. The second is the Ji-Cha War Area, comprising remnant Chongqing troops scattered in the Hebei-Chahar region, Commander-in-Chief concurrently held by Jiang Dingwen, the Commander-in-Chief of the First War Area, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Pang Bingxun, with a total strength of nine divisions. There are also two border areas, one being the Lu-Su-Yu-Wan Border Area, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, and the other being the Lu-Su-Wan Border Area, Commander Wang Zhonglian. The troop strength in both areas is extremely weak, consisting of only one division directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction and some guerrillas, attempting to stir up trouble in the border regions of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Secondly, there are approximately 250,000 Communist troops entrenched in the Central and North China areas. Among them, the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Eighteenth Group Army are Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, respectively. Those entrenched in the North China area include Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, Xu Xiangqian, Commander of the Lu-Su-Yu Border Region, He Long, Commander of the Jin-Northwest Military Region, and Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. The total strength of these four border regions is approximately 160,000 to 170,000. There is also the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region centered around Yan'an, the base of the Chinese Communist Party, with approximately 35,000 troops. The New Fourth Army, with its base in northern Jiangsu, Commander-in-Chief Chen Yi, divided into seven divisions, has a strength of approximately 50,000 troops. Since the Nationalist government forces and the Japanese army jointly launched a suppression campaign, it is now on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Washington dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden had a lengthy meeting with Roosevelt last night, discussing war and post-war issues. Prior to that, Eden had first met with Roosevelt's personal advisors, Hopkins and Berle. It is reported that today Eden will meet with American senators and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - According to news from Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov yesterday afternoon. Strang, a Soviet affairs expert from the British Foreign Office, was also present.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Diplomatic circles here believe that Eden's visit to Washington is an inevitable result of the Casa Blanca and Adana conferences. The purpose of the Casa Blanca conference was to adjust the anti-Axis military plans among the Allied nations, but the United States and Britain could not reach a consensus on their attitude towards the Soviet Union. At that time, Roosevelt and Churchill decided to further clarify the Soviet issue in Washington later. Recently, due to the Polish-Soviet dispute and the Soviet Union's lack of trust in the Casa Blanca and Adana conferences, London wanted to conduct British-American negotiations as soon as possible to discuss countermeasures. Churchill was unable to go to Washington due to illness, so he ordered Eden to go in his place. It is reported that during the Adana conference, the United States and Britain mentioned the organization of a united front to deal with Russia after the victory. The Kremlin was suspicious of this, so it instructed its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, to demand that Britain formally recognize the minimum demands of the Soviet Union, thus triggering the Polish-Soviet dispute. Therefore, this Washington conference is of great significance. However, it is generally expected that the United States and Britain will not adopt a clear attitude of firm rejection towards Soviet demands, so as not to strengthen Soviet distrust.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Plans to Establish a New Europe to be Announced by Axis Powers <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - The Axis powers are currently discussing the future state of Europe. Authoritative sources will make an announcement soon. It is generally believed that the form of the new Europe cannot be decided solely by politicians at the conference table, but should be based on past experience and determined by the needs of the environment. The relationship between the Axis powers has long been developed according to this principle. Now, it is possible to make a clear announcement of the final goal. The communique issued after the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has already revealed some hints. Since the Soviet Union and the Polish government had a dispute over the border issue, and Britain expressed no interest, all European countries, especially neutral countries, felt terrified. Recently, there has been talk of British Foreign Secretary Eden visiting the United States to consult with Washington on revising the Atlantic Charter. These rumors are not without cause. Therefore, the Axis powers' announcement of the plan to establish a new Europe is eagerly awaited by all parties.</p>

The location was at an airfield somewhere behind the front lines. General von Manstein, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, and General Richthofen, Commander of the Air Force, were both present. Military circles in Berlin believe that the Führer's visit was to study future strategies after defeating the Soviet army's winter offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - There have been no major changes in the Eastern Front in the past 24 hours. Fierce fighting is still ongoing east of Kharkov on the Donets front. The Soviet army's manpower has been exhausted, with only one division withdrawn from the Mius front being transferred there for combat. West of Belgorod and northwest of Kursk, the German army continues to make progress in its eastward offensive. The fighting in the Orel area is only of a local nature.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Allied Press Telegram) - Reuters correspondent in Moscow reported last night that the Red Army has so far failed to stem the German counteroffensive on the Donets River.

<p>Berlin, 18th (Allied Press Telegram) - Official sources here announced last night that a part of the British Eighth Army in southern Tunisia launched an offensive on a broad front against the Mareth Line on Tuesday night. The German Africa Corps is firmly defending its positions. The British army has been deploying for several weeks, so this move was long expected. However, it is not yet certain whether its nature is a general offensive or merely a probing attack. What is known is that only a part of the British artillery has begun shelling. It is expected that the British offensive will intensify in the coming days. The British offensive was launched at 10:30 PM on Tuesday night at the coastal end of the Mareth Line, followed by heavy shelling, which intensified in the evening. It is not yet known whether the Allied forces will launch an offensive in central and northern Tunisia to support it. However, according to aerial reconnaissance, the American Fifth Army has been deployed extensively near the Axis forces' front lines in central Tunisia.</p>

<p>Madrid, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - The new Spanish Cortes (parliament) opened yesterday. Head of State Franco personally attended and delivered a speech, clarifying the direction of domestic and foreign policy. He stated that Spain was unified by victory on the battlefield, so in the future, if there are obstacles, it will spare no sacrifice to overcome them. This world war is closely related to the threat of Bolshevism. The source of this threat mainly lies in Stalin's destructive and divisive world revolutionary ideology. The Red Army was initially built with the expectation of waiting for an opportunity, but since the Soviet Union joined the war, the war has become a struggle of life and death. Today, Germany has a population of 100 million, and Italy and Britain also have vast populations at their disposal. At this time of historical turmoil, Spain should do its best to maintain order and ensure domestic security, so that it can shoulder a major mission for Europe on the day the war ends.</p>

<p>Ankara, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Turkish Prime Minister Saracoğlu stated in a speech to the National Assembly yesterday that Turkey's foreign policy should be based on protecting the country's interests as a prerequisite. The Anglo-Turkish Agreement is based on mutual benefits. The Turkish President has a long-term vision and a strong military to back it up, so he can implement such foreign policies. In 1943, Turkey's military expenditure reached 500,000,000 Turkish pounds, while in peacetime, 100,000,000 pounds would be sufficient. Due to the government's large expenditures and financial difficulties, the budget has been balanced after much effort, and the state of paper currency has also improved. As for supply, the government is determined to eliminate the black market and will now find ways to implement state control over all necessities. Although Turkey's supply situation is not very good, it is ten thousand times higher compared to other countries.</p>

<p>Following the Japanese army's entry into the French concession area of Guangzhou Bay and the Vichy government's declaration of abolishing extraterritorial rights in China and returning the administrative rights of the concessions, the issue of adjusting the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, which was established in 1941 to adapt to the new situation in East Asia, has also been resolved recently in Japan-Vietnam relations. From late February to early March, France clarified its attitude of cooperation with the Axis powers, especially its deep understanding of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, Vietnam itself is also getting closer to Japan. Regarding this trend, when the Japanese army entered Guangzhou Bay, the Chongqing regime protested to French officials in Chongqing, and the Chongqing diplomatic mission in Vichy, using the Vichy government's declaration as an excuse, withdrew from France, and its feelings towards France deteriorated. The Vietnamese border bordering the Chongqing regime will naturally become tense. In order to investigate the local situation, this reporter surveyed the northern border of Vietnam and first visited the city of Lao Cai.</p>
<p>Departing from Hanoi along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, we arrived at Phuc Xa station, one station before Lao Cai, at 5:00 AM the next day. Staying at the inn at the station, which was bombed by the US Air Force last summer, the glass of the two main doors inside and outside was shattered, covered with blue cellophane. The walls of the station staff's dormitory were also repaired with cement. One can imagine the intensity of the bombing at the time. Fragments of bombs are still visible today.</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was a major artery for aiding Chiang Kai-shek. When its transportation capacity reached its peak, more than 200 cargo trains ran every day. One Lao Cai station was not enough to operate, so a new station was opened two kilometers behind Lao Cai to facilitate transportation. The inn inside the station is not inferior to the inns in Hanoi. Today, seeing the remnants of the bombing by the Chongqing side, I cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day the reporter arrived at Phuc Xa station, an old man from the inn suddenly knocked on the door and said, "The enemy planes are coming! The enemy planes are coming!" He advised me to take shelter in the air-raid shelter. In the steel-concrete air-raid shelter, there was a team of Annam honor guards that I had met in front of the inn, who were originally preparing to welcome Governor Ervin of Tonkin, who was scheduled to stay at the inn that evening, also looked uneasy. After the enemy planes passed beyond the border, the French old man at the inn ran out angrily and said, "What's all the fuss about!" Enmity was obviously written on his face.</p>
<p>The city of Lao Cai is located at the intersection of the Red River and its tributary, the Nanxi River. The intersection of the two rivers forms a swastika shape, which constitutes the border between Vietnam and China. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has a 120-meter-long iron bridge over the Nanxi River, which enters Hekou, China, and extends along the valley of this river from Mengzi to Kunming. The railway bridge was blown up by the Chongqing side after the Japanese army entered northern Vietnam. Now, a section of about 20 meters of the first bridge pier on the Vietnamese side still remains. The bridges behind it are all rusted and have fallen into the river. Standing at one end of the damaged bridgehead, the Chongqing army walking back and forth on the opposite shore, their gray uniforms and yellow faces, can all be seen clearly.</p>
<p>The Chongqing army has built the first to fourth lines of defense in the mountains surrounding the rear of Hekou, cleverly concealed behind the trees. They are equipped with mortars and defended by a part of the elite 19th Division of the 54th Army of the Central Army in Yunnan.</p>
<p>On the Vietnamese side, a hundred meters away, soldiers from the 〇〇 unit and Vietnamese troops are monitoring every day. The foremost line of the border is jointly defended by Japan and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Through special arrangements by the 〇〇 unit, we heard about the situation on the other side of the border from Lieutenant Liu (25th Division of the 52nd Army of the Central Army) and Lieutenants Gan and Tai (184th Division of the 1st Army of Yunnan), who had fled from Yunnan and surrendered.</p>
<p>The Chongqing army is afraid of the Japanese army's attack, so it has thoroughly destroyed the 177-kilometer-long railway between Hekou and Mengzi on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The 466-kilometer section between Mengzi and Kunming is operated under the supervision of the Central Army, but it only runs once a day in both directions. As for the highway, the motor road to Kunming has been destroyed, and the enemy's contact between the front line and Kunming relies only on radio, walking, and horses. It takes one month for the fastest and three months for the slowest. Therefore, the army's food supply is gradually becoming insufficient, and the local small sales are also due to the barren terrain, which previously relied on Vietnam for supplies. Therefore, the extent of the lack of supplies is worrying.</p>
<p>From ordinary soldiers to lieutenant-level officers, they only rely on a small amount of corn and sweet potato porridge every day. Every six days, each company is given five catties of lard, which is dissolved and cooked with wild vegetables, which is already considered a happy thing. As a result, prices are high. A box of Vietnamese-made tobacco costs only 35 cents in Hanoi, but costs about 20 yuan across the border, and is worth 25 yuan further inland.</p>
<p>The soldiers' salaries are 8.5 yuan for second-class soldiers, 9.5 yuan for first-class soldiers, 10.4 yuan for privates, 160 yuan for captains, 60 yuan for lieutenants, and 56 yuan for second lieutenants. Therefore, lieutenant-level officers cannot afford cigarettes. The central army in Yunnan Province has become very radical. The main parts centered on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway are all occupied by the central army, and the Yunnan army is only in the part west of the railway. The military powers of the Yunnan leaders have now been eliminated, and they only have administrative powers. The prestige of the central army is greatly enhanced, but there are often reports of residents and the central army being estranged due to language barriers.</p>
<p>The central army facing Lao Cai is the 5th Division and the 54th Division, which have fought with the Japanese army in the Central China area and know the strength of the Japanese army. In addition, the 5th Army, which Chiang Kai-shek regards as elite, was also defeated on the Burma front. Coupled with the lack of supplies and internal turmoil, the general morale is very low. This is naturally regarded as a troublesome matter by Chiang, so he plans to transfer troops from the Hunan area to renew the morale of the area. He also plans to mobilize the spirit mobilization team centered on Kunming to instill war consciousness into the residents, but it has no effect.</p>
<p>The city of Hekou feels an extreme lack of supplies, so it is discussing with the Vietnamese side to open the ferry to Lao Cai from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM during the day, so that residents can buy main foods, side dishes, and food items.</p>
<p>For this three-hour round trip, the boat fare is 20 cents. Residents of Hekou cross the Nanxi River to Lao Cai, go through physical examinations by Vietnamese military police and customs, and use their resident permits as collateral to shop in the city. On average, 300 to 400 people come every day, 80% of whom are women, buying vegetables, rice, etc. to take back.</p>
<p>According to Vietnamese police officers, after the Japanese army bombed Hekou, most of the residents seem to have decreased, and most of those who remain are poor people who have lost their hostility, but are still being driven to do useless resistance. On this side of the river, the Japanese and Vietnamese armies are jointly defending firmly. Although the sound of enemy artillery can be heard from time to time in the mining area outside Lao Cai, they are still leisurely mining apatite, carrying out industrial construction, exploiting endless buried treasures, and exporting them to Japan.

<h3 id="e27">Thailand Economic Overview: Refreshed Drama Group Becomes Part of the Co-prosperity Sphere <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The core of Thailand's economic structure is agriculture, followed by forestry and mining. The main agricultural products are rice and rubber, forest products are malili trees, and minerals are mainly tin. However, in Thailand's industrial economy, only rice production has the Thai people's own subjectivity. The production of other major industries is almost entirely dependent on foreign capital, especially British capital. Even in the commercial field, it is dominated by overseas Chinese forces. This was the whole picture of Thailand's economy before the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand concluded a defensive alliance with Japan. On January 25th of last year, it issued a proclamation declaring war on Britain and the United States, completely breaking away from its dependence on Britain and the United States. The face of the Thai economy has also changed dramatically, with a comprehensive reorganization of its economy from a new perspective—that of becoming part of the co-prosperity sphere. The exchange of goods between Japan and Thailand has also proceeded smoothly. The currency policy has shifted from being linked to the pound and the dollar to being linked to the Japanese yen. Public finance has shifted from peacetime finance to wartime finance. Other changes, such as the strengthening of economic controls and the significant progress of state capital, all indicate changes in the face of the Thai economy, which are noteworthy phenomena. The following is a description of the recent changes in the Thai economy.</p>
<p>Finance: Before the war, the reserves for the issuance of Thai banknotes were mostly in British and American currencies. When the war broke out, the Thai economy lost its pound and dollar funds, causing a temporary turmoil in the financial world. Withdrawals of deposits increased sharply, gradually presenting a dangerous malignant inflation. In response to this situation, the government made great efforts to suppress inflation, implementing restrictions on the use of bills and checks, and restrictions on the withdrawal of deposits. As a result, the amount of banknotes issued was limited to 316 million baht (Thai currency, end of March 1942). However, behind the decrease in total deposits in the city's banks, there was a shift from gold to goods, gradually showing a tendency for a decrease in time deposits and an increase in demand deposits. Therefore, the financial world cannot be said to be stable.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, according to the Japan-Thailand Economic Agreement, an equivalence relationship between the Japanese yen and the Thai baht was established. As a result, the connection between the baht and the pound rapidly shifted to a connection with the Japanese yen. At the same time, Thailand, through the establishment of Japan-Thailand loans, obtained a loan of 200 million yen. The banknote issuance reserves also increased to 330 million baht due to the inclusion of 130 million baht in domestic gold reserves, achieving a 100% reserve ratio for the issuance of banknotes. Furthermore, by using the special yen, which is the external settlement currency of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, as its reserve, the stability of the external value of the baht was ensured. However, the tendency to exchange goods has not yet been changed. In addition, there is an increase in government fiscal expenditures, a sharp decrease in the volume of trade due to the severance of overseas trade, and industrial damage caused by floods. Therefore, the future of Thailand's financial economy is not optimistic. However, although the Thai economy has encountered an unprecedented period of drastic change, the transition of the financial world, generally speaking, has been relatively calm. This is largely due to the Thai government's appropriate handling of financial policies and its great efforts in organizing financial institutions.</p>
<p>Overviewing Thailand's financial policy, the government first implemented restrictions on deposit withdrawals to suppress inflation, and then implemented the New Currency Exchange Control Law (February 1st of last year), clearly stating that it was breaking away from the gold and pound connection, stopping the exchange of gold and pounds for Thai baht, and adopting an exchange permit system, making great efforts to prevent overseas remittances from overseas Chinese and other means.</p>
<p>While the Thai government adopted policies to stabilize the value of money internally and externally from the monetary aspect, it also worked hard to improve financial institutions. The first thing worth noting is the promulgation of the Central Bank Law. The Central Bank Law was promulgated on May 5th of last year, and the Bank of Thailand (with a capital of 20 million) was established on December 10th of the same year in accordance with the law, giving it the functions of a purely central bank. Due to the establishment of this bank, the unification of the financial world has been further strengthened, and its future activities are highly anticipated. In addition, savings associations have been organized in various places, and the state-owned Thai Life Insurance Company was established in June of last year. Through these means, efforts are being made to absorb excess purchasing power. On the other hand, credit cooperatives are being added in various prefectures and counties to promote the enrichment of agricultural finance.</p>
<p>Finance: As Thailand's economy entered the stage of a wartime system, military expenditures also increased significantly in fiscal expenditures. In 1942, the total of regular and special expenditures for national defense was 116 million baht, accounting for 41.6% of the total budget expenditure. Secondly, the significant increase in industrial construction funds (121 million baht) is also noteworthy.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many expenditures related to promoting industry, such as the establishment funds for the central bank, government funds for rubber companies and tin production companies, which are enough to see the future direction of the Thai government.</p>
<p>As for the revenue side, although it has gradually increased, it is still insufficient. Although there is an intention to make up for this shortfall from the natural increase in rice transaction tax, direct tax, indirect tax, and public enterprise income, the result is that it is intended to be made up for by the issuance of national bonds and local construction bonds of 1.177 million baht and the acquisition of the right to issue construction bonds of 60 million baht. The national bonds are planned to be taken over by the central bank, but because it has not been established, the provisional method is to borrow from city banks and temporarily borrow from the currency section of the National Treasury to make up for it. This result inevitably leads to an increase in the issuance of government banknotes. However, in order to avoid inflation, the government is now working hard to improve financial institutions, increase production, and establish price control policies.</p>
<p>Price Control: Regarding price control, the Controlled Price Law and the Daily Necessities and Food Control Order have been implemented. Due to the former, a central committee was established in the center, and local committees were established in various counties. The local committees are subject to the command and supervision of the central committee. The committee stipulates controlled materials and their types, and has the power to conduct investigations, allocate, and set official prices. The latter grants broad powers regarding the control of transactions in daily necessities and food, the allocation of goods, the determination of maximum prices, and the investigation of inventories. However, because the official prices set by the committee did not take into account the actual market prices, the market prices and the official prices were very different. Therefore, black market transactions were rampant, which contributed to the tendency of rising prices. In August of last year, the official prices of daily necessities and food were abolished, and fair prices set by the operators themselves were used as the basis. Only for nineteen important commodities such as sugar, soap, clothing, iron nails, and medicines, official prices were re-set, and the relevant laws and regulations were revised to strengthen the penalties for violations, and strict penalties such as the death penalty and life imprisonment were stipulated. Before the war, the quantity of imported goods was about 25% of the total production. After the outbreak of the war, it was completely cut off. For this reason, the Thai economy has an inevitable tendency for rising prices. However, although there has been such a period of change, prices have gradually stabilized. This is due not only to the appropriate measures of the Thai government, but also to the gradual increase of Japanese goods in the Thai market. In short, Thailand keenly feels that on the one hand, it is necessary to urgently seek the closer relationship between Japan and Thailand's economies, and on the other hand, it is necessary to urgently seek the development of its own industries. The recent question of how to transform from an agricultural country to a light industrial country is precisely a manifestation of the government's policy, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Industrial Policy: After the outbreak of the war, the main goal of the Thai government's economic policy is also clear in its direct statement in the declaration of war. It is to drive out the traditional foreign capital and operate with Thailand's own economic strength. Therefore, the first thing they started to do was to improve the economic structure. The government, with the proclamation of the State Council on February 17th of last year, established the Construction Industry Committee, and divided it into seven small committees such as soap, steelmaking, and ceramics. In April of last year, the Executive Industry Committee was established. In September of the same year, the two committees were merged and reorganized into the National Industry Committee. In the committee's plan, it is planned to establish a central industrial company to become a general investment company. It is also planned to increase the number of pottery factories, spinning factories, and daily necessities factories. In short, that industrial plan indicates that Thailand's urgent necessities are light industrial products mainly based on sugar (40,000 tons), cotton cloth (20 million baht), mineral oil (120 million liters), and other tobacco, matches, soap, and chemical products. The government first focused on increasing the production of beet and cotton. In April of this year, it planned to expand the existing sugarcane planting area of 50,000 rai to produce 22,000 tons of sugar, and established a sugar production increase plan, increasing the number of state-run sugar refineries in northeastern Thailand to expand production. Regarding the promotion of cotton production, the government has selected fifteen counties in northern Thailand since the previous year to work hard to promote cotton production, and established two cotton spinning factories. Between January and September 1941, the total cotton production reached 100,000 dan, 25% of which was for domestic consumption, 25% for the Thai spinning industry, and the remaining 50% was exported. The cotton planting area is also gradually increasing as a result of the government's promotion. Tobacco has always been overwhelmed by British and American tobacco, and the domestic tobacco industry has been depressed. However, the government promulgated the Tobacco Control Law in 1939, and the following year, it bought the tobacco factories of British and American tea and converted them into state-run enterprises. As a result, the Thai tobacco manufacturing industry was monopolized by the government. Matches were almost self-sufficient before the war, but after the outbreak of the war, there was a temporary shortage due to the severance of drug imports. In this way, the government, while seeking to increase the production of daily necessities, placed the country's major factories under military management to expand the production of important industries during wartime. In June of the same year, the National Industry Conference was held to discuss in detail the promotion of home industry, the promotion of forestry and mining development, etc. The government's intention is to turn all these important industries into state-run enterprises and completely drive out foreign capital. Therefore, it announced the establishment of the Thai Tin Mining Rubber Company (with a capital of 50 million baht) and the Timber Company (with a capital of 25 million baht). The government invested 25% of the capital in the two companies, both of which were operated by inheriting the confiscated property of the British system, and their business has already begun. In addition, the establishment of cooperatives is noteworthy in agricultural policy. These cooperatives are generally established with government funds. The original intention of establishing this kind of cooperative is to establish a rural economy mainly based on Thai people, and at the same time to eliminate the power of overseas Chinese middlemen. Therefore, its future trend is worth paying attention to. In order to improve the distribution mechanism, there is a proposal to establish a domestic products company, which is currently in progress.</p>
<p>An overview of the Thai economy has been made. What is worth noting is that the economic relationship between Japan and Thailand has become closer after the outbreak of the war. At the same time, the exchange of important materials such as rice, tin, and rubber from Thailand and textile products from Japan has also been promoted smoothly. On the one hand, the entry and exit of state capital has replaced the declining British capital. However, Thailand, which originally lacked the accumulation of national capital, is still dominated by the economic power of overseas Chinese. Considering this point, it seems that further policies are necessary for Thailand's economic development as part of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.

<p>According to Shanghai News reporters, in order to revive the industrial and commercial industries in this city and stabilize prices, the relevant authorities in this city are trying to adjust the organizational structure of various industry associations, so as to have a strong organization to jointly seek the welfare of the industry. Now the authorities are proceeding separately, and it is planned to abolish or merge the same industry associations in the shortest possible time, such as (1) public associations of banks, money houses, and silver houses, which will be merged into "Financial Industry Association," divided into Bank Section, Money House Section, Silver House Section; (2) public associations of coal industry, coal balls, firewood, and charcoal, which will be merged into "Fuel Industry Association," divided into various sections; (3) public associations of miscellaneous grains, rice shops, and sales agents, which will be merged into Food Industry Association, and the internal affairs will be handled in sections according to the actual situation. Other industries such as cotton cloth, department stores, vehicles, and other industry associations will also be handled in accordance with the regulations. The organization of industry associations in this city is known to be more extensive than in other places. Before the war, there were about four or five hundred units. After the war, more than 300 units were approved for establishment by the social movement authorities. It is true that quite a few of the entire directors and supervisors of the various industry associations are legally elected by the members' congress. However, it has also been heard that some people despise the laws and do not elect and appoint candidates in accordance with the regulations. As a result, the candidates for the various industry associations are inevitably uneven. It is now learned that in order to adapt to the wartime economy and increase production, the authorities, in addition to rectifying the various industry associations, stipulate that the entire directors and supervisors of all public associations must be elected legally and must not be nominated in other ways.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Talks About the Current Situation of the U.S. and Chongqing Air Force <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 pm yesterday (18th), the press department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai held a routine meeting with the Chinese press corps in this city. During the meeting, the spokesperson of the press department of the Japanese Army gave a detailed account of the current situation of the Chongqing Air Force and the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. According to the spokesperson, the Chongqing Air Force, with the assistance of the United States, is actively rebuilding its air force, and the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is also trying to launch a counterattack against Japan. However, the United States' assistance to Chongqing with aircraft has not progressed as desired. At present, the Japanese Air Force's continuous surprise attacks on the enemy's inland bases have repeatedly destroyed their offensive attempts. Observing the active situation of the Japanese Army aircraft for about a month from late January to late February, the number of sorties reached more than 20 times. The places that have become bombing targets include Wengyuan, Zhaoqing, Qingyuan, Huizhou, Sicheng Road, Laohekou Airport, Guoyang, near Sandouping, near Badong, Hanzhong Airport, Guilin Airport, Hengyang Airport, Lushi Airport, Liuzhou Airport, Liangshan Airport, and Wanxian and Anqing Airport, and other inland aviation bases, as well as important military facilities. Bombing is still continuing. The battle results are very great. The Chongqing Air Force, with the Aviation Committee as the center, is working hard to add factories related to aircraft, and newly build airports or air defense facilities. Especially in terms of air defense, since the beginning of March, the Sichuan Provincial Air Defense Conference has been held in Chengdu. As the bombing season is approaching, the air raids by the Japanese Air Force have made people panic. The aircraft of the Chongqing Air Force, whether bombers or fighter planes, have been mainly American-made in the past. There are also Soviet-made bombers mixed in. However, recently, a small number of British-made new aircraft have been added, which has made their types and models more complicated. At present, most of the Chongqing Air Force personnel were trained by Americans or Italians at the aviation schools in Hangzhou or Nanchang before and after the incident. Among them, some outstanding personnel were selected and sent to the United States to study. Some of them have returned home after two years of training, and some are still receiving training in the United States. Also, Mao Bangchu, the commander of the Chongqing Air Force, has recently gone to the United States to ask the United States to strengthen its assistance. Zhou Zhirou, the director of the Chongqing Aviation Committee, once said when he met with American reporters, "Although Chongqing is training pilots, the only defect is that even if the number of aircraft is increased, it will be of no avail." This exposed the fact that the increase in aircraft has not progressed as desired. After that, it is not known how many aircraft have been imported from the United States, but it is roughly estimated that 20 fighter planes are imported every month. Then the current strength of the Chongqing Air Force is about 200 in total. Bombers account for about one-fifth of them. Also, the P66 type has the largest number of fighter planes, followed by the P40E type and the E16 type. Its gathering bases are in Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Liangshan, Kunming and other places. It specializes in lurking in the interior. The main force of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is placed in Kunming, Zhan Yi, and Guilin. The force is concentrated on the Burmese front. It has a rather negative attitude towards the Chinese battlefield. In mid-February, it attempted to jointly attack the Chinese front with the Chongqing Air Force, but on February 24, it was crushed by a joint surprise attack by Japanese fighter planes and bombers on Liangshan. In the future, there is still a possibility that the Chongqing Air Force and the U.S. Air Force will jointly attack when the opportunity arises. The current strength of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is about half of the strength of the Chongqing Air Force, estimated to be about 100 aircraft. Bombers account for more than one-fifth of the total number, and the number is gradually decreasing. However, all types are B25 type. As for the aviation-related factories currently in Chongqing, including the field repair factories, there are about 40 in total, scattered in Lanzhou, Chengdu, Jianzhou, Baishiyi, Suining, Liangshan, Jiading, Ya'an, Dading, Guiyang, Dushan Kunming, Duan, Liuzhou, Lin'an, and Hengyang and other places.</p>

<p>The China Central Tobacco Distribution Association has completed the registration and review of all wholesale cigarette companies in the city in order to unify and centrally distribute cigarettes. The approved wholesalers include: (1) 300 large wholesale companies, and (2) more than 5,400 small retail companies. The large wholesale companies are divided into Class A and Class B levels, and have filled out sworn statements separately. They have also paid the deposit to the Tobacco Industry Bank within the prescribed time limit.</p>
<p>Profits: Cigarettes produced by the military-managed Yi Zhong Tobacco Company, the Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company, and the Chinese-owned Nanyang, Huacheng, Fuxin, and Datong factories are all centrally distributed by the association. The door-to-door sales prices of various cigarettes have been set. In addition to being given legal profits, distributors must absolutely sell at the price limit. Violators will be permanently deprived of distribution rights and will be investigated. As for the distribution of goods to small companies, large companies are entrusted to handle it. As for the profits, it has been stipulated that the door-to-door sales profit is 20%, and the distribution profit to small companies is 5%.</p>
<p>Distribution: In order to implement the distribution of cigarettes, the association convened a meeting of wholesalers (large companies) who had signed sworn statements and paid deposits at the City Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 pm yesterday. The chairman, Shen Weiting, reported on the centralized distribution method and hoped that all members of the industry would abide by all the rules and regulations of the association and operate in accordance with the price limit. The "Designation Certificates" of the large wholesale companies and the distribution cards of the small retail companies were issued to facilitate the implementation of the distribution of goods. It is heard that all the designated wholesalers swore on the spot that they would handle the matter in accordance with the sworn statement.</p>
<p>Distribution: Shanghai News reporters learned from the association yesterday that the date of implementation of the centralized distribution of cigarettes will be determined after all preparations are completed. It will start no later than the end of March, and the association will officially announce it. As for the prices of all cigarettes, they have been adjusted according to the cost of each factory and will also be announced. After that, no matter which company sells cigarettes, the price of the cigarettes sold will be in accordance with the price limit, and there will be no so-called cigarette black market.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau in this city has been ordered to be transferred to the Ministry of Construction of the Executive Yuan. The reorganization was implemented on March 1st of this year, adjusting internal personnel and planning for the improvement of maritime affairs. The work has been extremely tense in recent days. The administrative policy after the reorganization is as follows: (1) Ship registration is to preserve the private rights of shipowners. Ship registration will always be more meticulous to ensure that shipowners have considerable rights and interests. (2) In order to ensure the safety of passengers and cargo transportation, the Bureau implements regular inspection of ships in accordance with laws and regulations. Shipowners often fail to continue to apply after the expiration date. In addition to urging them, the Jianghai Customs is also requested to assist. When ships that have not been re-inspected by the Bureau after the expiration date are declared, they will not be cleared. (3) The depth of ship personnel's qualifications is related to the safety of passenger and cargo transportation in the shipping industry, which has a huge impact. In the future, the Bureau will conduct more accurate assessments of ship personnel, and promote them in a short period of time, and request the Ministry to conduct inspections.</p>

<p>To raise funds for the Tongren Fuyuan Hall charity, the Tongren Fuyuan Cup charity football match, initiated by the enthusiastic social entrepreneur Mr. Chen Zoudang, was held at Yiyuan on Albert Road last weekend. The two major Chinese giants, Lunghwa and Tunghwa, battled it out. Unfortunately, Lunghwa lost to Tunghwa by a score of five to two due to the absence of key players. A second duel is scheduled for today at 5:00 PM at the same location. The organizers have invited Mr. Hu Guoqiao of the French Public Works Department to serve as honorary chairman and appointed Zhang Daozhe, Song Qi, Xu Zhihao, Dong Xiaopei, Gu Rong, and Hu Guoan as organizing committee members and general affairs team cadres, and Qin Liang and Liao Shiming as ticketing inspectors. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi will personally host the opening kick-off, and there will be a charity ball auction. Tickets are divided into four types: 10 yuan, 20 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. All proceeds will be donated to the hall. The competition adopts a two-win system. The first battle was held last week. Today, the two teams meet again, and the victory or defeat is crucial. Tunghwa's strength is well-known, and their technique is superb. The Lunghwa team is on par with the Italian Navy in the Western League A Group League, leading the pack. Last week, due to the absence of key players Li Yichen, Li Tiansheng, and Gao Baozheng, and the fierce battle against Saint Francis at Jiaozhou Park the day before, the entire team was exhausted and lost control. Today, they will definitely give it their all. The victory or defeat of the two teams is difficult to predict, and there will definitely be a wonderful performance. The ribbons issued before are invalid. Souvenir badges can be exchanged for tickets from Mr. Chen Zoudang at the door. The line-ups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e48">Exchanging Cotton Yarn and Cloth for Cotton <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Central China Cotton Control Association, in order to alleviate the livelihood of cotton farmers in the interior who are deeply threatened by speculative merchants, plans to allocate cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other daily necessities in large quantities at official prices to stabilize their livelihood and increase the amount of cotton purchased. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth can be shipped and allocated to Jiangbei and other cotton-producing areas in mid-month. As for foreign goods such as cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, and sugar, allocation will also be gradually implemented from next month. In order to prevent the monopoly of intermediary merchants, the association has also ordered its subordinate institutions in various places to provide exchange coupons for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other daily necessities in proportion to the amount of cotton, in addition to paying cash when purchasing cotton in various places. Cotton farmers can transfer the exchange coupons and attach cash to the necessities exchange, and purchase allocated materials at official prices.</p>
<p>If the above measures can be carried out smoothly, the satisfactory results can be guaranteed. In short, there are about five points:</p>
<p>(1) The stable livelihood of farmers will encourage them to work hard to produce food and industrial raw materials to supply the cities.</p>
<p>(2) With a steady supply of food and industrial raw materials from farmers, the livelihood of urban residents will also be stabilized.</p>
<p>(3) With a source of raw materials and a sales channel for its products, Shanghai's textile industry will embark on the road to recovery, and other industries will also follow suit and recover.</p>
<p>(4) If cities can supply rural areas with low-priced industrial products, then rural areas can also supply cities with low-priced agricultural products. The height of prices of industrial products and agricultural products is closely related to each other. Now that Shanghai can resolutely supply rural areas with low-priced industrial products first, rural areas will also be willing to supply Shanghai with low-priced agricultural products. With low raw material prices and falling costs, the prices of Shanghai's industrial products will inevitably be lower in the future.</p>
<p>(5) After the prices of major industrial products and agricultural products are low and flat, the prices of non-major products will also be low and flat, which will cause hoarders to panic and come out of their cages, and the prices of general commodities will be low and flat, and the value of the currency will be maintained and rise. Some say that in this way, hoarders will suffer unbearable losses. This is a seemingly correct but actually wrong argument. Although hoarded goods fall in price, the daily necessities of hoarders also fall in price. What loss is there? Conversely, although hoarded goods rise in price, the daily necessities of hoarders also rise in price. What benefit is there? Harming others and not benefiting oneself, how foolish!</p>

The Central Reserve Bank, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Savings Association Supervisory Committee, appointed Tang Shoumin and 12 others, as well as Liu Ruxiang, Wu Jiyun, and Shao Shijun, three directors and supervisors of the bank (Central Reserve Bank), as supervisory committee members. It is learned that in order to prepare for the takeover and reorganization of the Central Savings Association, a special meeting of the supervisory committee will be convened today (19th) to discuss and implement everything.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: Since the National Commercial Control Association's Material Movement Application Office began handling material movement application permits on the 16th of this month, a large number of Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city have gone to collect the permit application forms, filled in the categories of materials to be moved in and out, and applied for permits from the office. The office's internal office system and the responsibilities of each department have been assigned. In order to unify and streamline the promotion of affairs, it is stipulated that the handling of application matters, in addition to assigning two people to be responsible for handling the application for the movement of each type of material, also stipulates that application documents will be collected in the morning, and merchants will only be allowed to collect permits in the afternoon. The application forms will be requested in writing by the trade associations of each industry. The Ministry of Industry and the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai have sent important personnel to assist and guide the matters to be handled. The Public Works Bureau has also sent police officers to maintain order. All office personnel follow the "fairness and integrity" indicated by the council to serve the society, and their work is quite serious. It is heard that yesterday (18th), a Japanese merchant food allocation association applied to the office for the purchase of rice from the mainland to be moved into Shanghai. The office considered it to be related to the people's food and ordered officials to expedite the review.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the new regulations on material control, there has been no significant trend in Shanghai's economic circles. The scope of this reform is extremely broad, so we are still in a wait-and-see attitude. Positive economic activities will be launched in the coming weeks. However, market prices are currently very level, with almost no changes. The activities of speculators have been frustrated. On the one hand, the restrictions on movement in the interior have been lifted, and the production and sales of agricultural products are relatively strong. It is expected that agricultural products in Shanghai will tend to be cheaper, and the price difference between Shanghai and the interior may gradually balance. (March 18, Continental News)</p>

<p>After the banking industry and other firms implemented tight lending to eliminate speculation and suppress prices, they have become extremely cautious about all lending, such as mortgages, credit overdrafts, etc. Applicants for loans are limited to members of the association, and the purpose of the loans is thoroughly investigated. Those deemed to promote hoarding and speculation are rejected, and there must be a legitimate reason for the need. The term of the loan must not exceed three months at most. After the previous old loans expire, they should be repaid in full. Since the implementation, the entire financial situation has stabilized, the money supply has eased, and the interbank loan rate has fallen to 0.16 yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Transformation of Economic Blockade Policy <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The National Government has now decided to establish a National Commercial Control Association as the central control agency for material purchase and allocation in Central China, and to jointly establish a Material Control Deliberation Council with the Japanese side as its advisory body. At the same time, it has revised the current Temporary Regulations for the Prohibition of Material Movement in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, effectively abolishing the restrictions on material movement in peaceful areas. These measures were implemented for local military operations, and the economic blockade policy in Central China, which was strengthened after the start of the Greater East Asia War, has now undergone a epoch-making transformation. After the National Government joined the war, the new strategy of gathering the total economic power of Japan and China was first realized concretely in the material purchase and allocation sector. From this, the National Government began to consolidate a unified and autonomous control mechanism for materials in Central China. After the National Government's strength is enhanced, what kind of effects can be achieved on the economic aspects of carrying out the Greater East Asia War depends on how the new agency operates in the future. The plan for this kind of material control agency has been tested and proved to be of great contribution to the revitalization of the economy in Central China.</p>
<p>Originally, a few months before the National Government joined the war, during the autumn harvest season last year, there was a reflection on the economic blockade in Central China's economic policy. After the successful opening of the Huai River in October and the establishment of the Joint Committee for the Purchase of Miscellaneous Grains by Japan and China in Bengbu, it was argued that the purchase and allocation of materials should be adapted to the actual local conditions, and the local Chinese capital and capabilities should be utilized as much as possible. This view gradually gained ground in the economic circles of Central China. The fact that the Grain Management Committee was upgraded and became independent as the Grain Department due to the reform of the National Government's administrative structure was not only aimed at ensuring grain, but also at enabling the Chinese side to actively participate in material purchase and increase production, so that the exchange of materials would become more flexible, and the link between Shanghai's industrial productivity and the interior's agricultural productivity would be strengthened, so that the value of reserve notes could be maintained, and the urgent price countermeasures in Central China would also be promoted by this.</p>
<p>The organization of the Material Control Deliberation Council has the participation of Chinese financial figures, and it is hoped that closer ties will be established between Shanghai's financial circles and the National Government. Their ideal of "Japanese-Chinese division of labor and cooperation" to combine the economic power of the two countries is first realized concretely in the commercial sector, so great expectations are placed on the future development of Japanese-Chinese economic relations.

<h3 id="e56">President Tsushima of the North China Development Corporation Discusses Future Economic Issues <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>President Tsushima Hisaichi of the North China Development Corporation came to Nanjing to inspect the economic situation in Central China. At 6:30 PM on the 17th, he met with newspaper reporters at the Ishibo Mansion and discussed the purpose of his visit to Nanjing and the development situation in North China. He said that he had been to Shanghai many times, but Nanjing was his first time. He felt that the capital under the war was full of vigor. He had long wanted to go to Nanjing to pay his respects to Chairman Wang and other important figures of the National Government, General Hata, and the military authorities, but due to excessive affairs after taking office as President of the North China Development Corporation, he was only able to fulfill his wish today. He met with his close friend Ishiwatari Advisor and Shanghai financial figures to hear about the situation here, so as to harmonize with the development policy of North China. This time, the purpose of coming to Nanjing was not for any specific issue, but to investigate the situation and seek exchange between the North and the South. He has a deep friendship with Mr. Takashima, the new President of the Central China Revitalization Company, but he did not have time to meet him due to time constraints. The development work in North China is progressing smoothly, and due to the progress of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation in the war, North China has become a rear military base, so its position is even more important. The related business companies are also constantly working hard, so this year's budget will be increased by a certain amount, and it is planned to return to Japan to discuss this matter with the central authorities. In concrete terms, because the material mobilization plan has not been determined, the details cannot be spoken. In short, the focus is on the development and increased production of coal, salt, and iron.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in the future is the exchange of materials between various parts of the mainland. The development of the mainland must provide materials to meet Japan's expectations. That is, China itself, since joining the war, must also seek the development of its industry and economy, so the exchange of materials in various places must be reasonable in order to cultivate combat power. The only good strategy for the development of the mainland economy is to produce and supply everything locally. This time, China's participation in the war is a great opportunity to solve this problem and promote economic development. It is hoped that we can go with sincerity and determination.</p>
<p>There are many discussions about the adjustment of state-owned companies, but in order to promote the future development of various companies, there are still two major issues that have to be considered, namely the composition of capital and the composition of personnel. At the beginning of this year, the five major coal mines managed by the military were merged into one and reorganized into a Chinese corporate company. All directors and supervisors below the president were appointed by Chinese, and the results were very satisfactory. I believe that this phenomenon will have a good impression on promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. At the same time, the transformation of Japan's policy towards China and the development of China will be able to speed up because of it.</p>
<p>Recently, the North China United Bank and the Bank of Japan concluded a 200 million yuan loan. This move has a very good impact on the economic circles of North China, promoting the allocation and utilization of funds, and it is believed that its contribution to promoting financial work is not small.

<p>The relationship between the functions and powers of the National Commercial Control Association and the original Municipal Chamber of Commerce is observed by powerful parties to be roughly as follows. The National Commercial Control Association will be the highest control agency for material purchase and allocation in Central China in the future, implementing control matters in accordance with the instructions of the government. However, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is different. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the representative of Shanghai's business community, responsible for making suggestions to the authorities and assisting them. At the same time, it can also serve as an agency for communicating opinions between the government and the people.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 18th, Central News Agency Telegraph: The Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry stated that pig and sheep intestines are a major export commodity, and the current market price has increased more than ten times compared to before. As for the inspection fee for the above-mentioned pig and sheep intestines, it was still determined before the incident. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval to appropriately increase the above-mentioned inspection fee in order to maintain treasury revenue.</p>

<p>There are as many as eight or nine coffee extract factories in this port. The five Japanese factories, namely Kimura, Shin興, Suginoya, Nihon屋, and Kotobuki商行, are facing difficulties in purchasing raw materials, and the soybean powder required for manufacturing is also very scarce. In addition, the competition among the same industry is at low prices, so the losses are huge. Therefore, a discussion meeting was held a few days ago. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to jointly form a trade association with Chinese coffee extract factories and be under the jurisdiction of the National Commercial Control Association. However, it is not known whether the Chinese side still has any opinions.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Don't Be Afraid of Loneliness! <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiyan</p>
<p>When you fight for a certain truth, and unfortunately fail, many people will flock to the banner of your opponents, become estranged from you, or even hurl abuse at you. A fear of loneliness will then quickly grow in your heart. However, in this situation, never be afraid of loneliness! You must continue to safeguard the truth and continue to strive.</p>
<p>Perhaps you think: many people are against the truth, what's the use of one person safeguarding and striving? You must know that the opposition of many people generally stems from two reasons: perhaps it is due to their instinct to curry favor with the powerful, or perhaps it is due to their attitude of echoing others.</p>
<p>Currying favor with the powerful can be said to be the instinct of most people in society. They fundamentally lack understanding of life. As long as someone gains a little success in fame or fortune, they will flatter them. Since your struggle has failed, your reputation is naturally not as prominent as that of your opponents. Therefore, for the sake of their own interests, they are bound to offer flattery. Originally, the fickleness of human relationships has been the same throughout history, but you must know that the power they curry favor with is inevitably bound to decline one day.</p>
<p>There are also people who, in their hearts, do not have the tendency to curry favor with the powerful, but hold an attitude of echoing others. The complex social environment has cultivated in them a habit of not being a "big shot" (?), a "yes-man" temperament. This temperament is less about being smooth and more about being cowardly. When encountering anything, they always think: "Everyone is doing it this way, so of course I will do it this way" or "Everyone tells me to do it this way, so I have no choice but to do it this way." The first viewpoint fully expresses the face of a yes-man; they have lost their own will. The second viewpoint even more reveals cowardice and incompetence.</p>
<p>Indeed, unconscious loneliness is unnecessary, but as long as you have clearly identified your goal, being lonely for the sake of truth is absolutely not to be feared. You certainly do not want to curry favor with the powerful like many people, nor do you want to echo others. Then, being lonely as a result of this is meaningful and valuable; and even if those who distance themselves from you to curry favor with the powerful and echo others, as long as they have not completely lost their souls, they will always admire you in their hearts.</p>
<p>Ibsen said in his play "An Enemy of the People": "The strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone." Don't be afraid of loneliness! As long as you always stick to the truth and constantly strive, you must firmly believe that you are always a strong person, and the final victory will surely come to your side.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Socrates' Last Words <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Weichaifu</p>
<p>Socrates, the founder of Greek philosophy, gave two last words to the living in the minute before he was sentenced to die by drinking poison:</p>
<p>"Say it and do it. A passionate declaration alone is useless!"</p>
<p>"I owe Asclepius a rooster. Can you (to his friend Crito by his bedside) remember to repay this debt?"</p>
<p>The first sentence fully embodies his teaching of "matching words with actions." He saw through the world's tendency to say without doing, speaking grandly in front of people, but completely acting as if nothing had happened once they turned their backs. He knew that if everyone could do everything they said, the world would not be so bad.</p>
<p>The second sentence seems a bit humorous. At the point of death, he took owing someone a rooster so seriously, but there is truth in it.</p>
<p>The great philosopher's death was marked by regret for an unfinished small task. What about us ordinary people? The unfinished work is not just a rooster, right? So, ordinary people often have so much to say at the point of death that they don't know which sentence to say first. The reason is that there are too many unfinished things.</p>
<p>His revelation, "Say it and do it, and pay off your debts!"</p>
<h3 id="e64">Enrich Yourself <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>How many professionals in the world are thinking day and night: how to please their superiors? So that their position can be promoted or secured. Therefore, they often try their best to exploit themselves and willingly offer flattery. At the same time, struggles and infighting often occur between colleagues.</p>
<p>What is the method to get promoted or keep a position? In fact, this is not difficult to do, and as long as you try your best to make yourself a capable and valuable person; so that your talent is sufficient to be competent in your position, then even if you do not diligently flatter others, they will naturally appreciate and respect you. Because all matters must be handled in an orderly and hopeful manner by a talented person. On the other hand, if one only uses flattery to obtain a superior position, but one's own talent is not competent, then later one will not only feel mentally distressed, but the result will inevitably be a day of demotion.</p>
<p>Therefore, a smart professional with aspirations will definitely focus his struggle on how to enrich himself.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Being a Person <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>If others are one-eyed, you might as well look at their half-face. If they are deaf, don't talk to them incessantly in a loud voice. If they are mute, then don't argue with them. Everyone should build a deep and large tomb in themselves, and bury the shortcomings and faults of friends.</p>
<p>Your "hands" can be a little rough, dirty, and filthy, but your heart should always be spotless.</p>
<p>I advise you not to worry too much. There are many worries in the world that are superfluous and harmful.</p>

<p>— Xinbo</p>
<p>"And also Fan Lihua, Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, the Nine Heavens Mysterious Lady, Wang Baochuan..." Xue Fengchun sat on the kang and told Yougong one by one.</p>
<p>Yu Duzhou returned to his original position, as did Yang Zijie and Genming.</p>
<p>"How about this?" Yu Duzhou came up with an idea after being bothered by Yougong. "Let's write 'dead head, living tail', and only after three years can we turn back. The land price should naturally be higher."</p>
<p>"What do you think, Lao Gen?" Yang Zijie thought this was also a solution and looked at Genming to ask.</p>
<p>"Then, then, then 'dead head, living tail'," Genming replied hesitantly. In reality, he could not but agree at this point.</p>
<p>Yang Zijie walked to Huang Chong'an's side and spoke earnestly for a long time. Huang Chong'an shook his head at one moment and nodded at another, expressing his opinion.</p>
<p>"Like this, is it good?" Yang Zijie bent his waist for a long time and quickly straightened up, asking in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Mmm." There was only this response.</p>
<p>Yang Zijie hurried over, excitedly, and said to Genming, "With great difficulty, after telling Old Master Huang again and again, Old Master Huang finally agreed: 'dead head, living tail', priced at sixty-five yuan. If you still don't agree, then I won't care."</p>
<p>"Let's say seventy yuan," Genming was still struggling.</p>
<p>"No, no!"</p>
<p>Another stalemate of arguing over too much or too little ensued. After arguing for a long time, the result was sixty-seven yuan, during which Yang Zijie was indeed tired from going back and forth between the kang and the account table several times.</p>
<p>Yu Duzhou's pen rewrote on the mulberry paper, and after a moment, he wrote "Itemized as follows." Genming took out a paper package from his shirt pocket with trembling hands and opened it on the table. Yu Duzhou pressed down on each receipt in the paper package and copied in what should be copied, and then continued writing. (15)</p>

<h3 id="e67">An Appeal for the Charitable Work of the Catholic Church <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Hanbi</p>
<p>Recently, due to a certain opportunity, I saw: (1) The Xujiahui Sacred Heart Infant Home has more than 500 infants and children. (2) The Xujiahui Tushanwan Orphanage has more than 300 children. (3) The Nan Shi Jichang Street Nursing Home has more than 260 elderly people. (4) The Nanshi Guohuo Road Xin Pu Yu Tang has thousands of men, women, old and young. (5) The Sacred Heart Convent on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession has more than 130 girls in a poor orphan care center. (6) The Renshan Tang Children's Clinic has fifty to sixty patients every day. (7) The Renci Hospital Clinic has one to two hundred patients every day. (8) The Renshan Infant Home has more than 40 infants. These are all charitable works of the Catholic Church in Shanghai, which are hosted by priests or nuns. Funding is a problem. Although the Poor and Sick Relief Association has recently provided some subsidies, it is difficult to sustain. Day in and day out, they have already spent most of their energy for the stomachs of many suffering people. Because of insufficient funds and inadequate food, many abandoned infants and those who are poor and sick cannot be taken in and die, and even those who have been taken in have a particularly high mortality rate due to lack of nutrition. It is truly sad to say! Even if we are not thinking of the country and the nation, for the sake of humanitarianism, we should never sit idly by and watch these many undertakings decline. We cannot but urgently make an effective appeal. I propose: (1) Please have the Social Service Department of Shen Bao initiate the establishment of a board of directors of the Shanghai Catholic Charitable Undertakings, inviting several well-known Catholic figures, such as Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, etc., to come out and call for it, with the consent of the heads of each undertaking, to govern the Catholic Charitable Undertakings. (2) Publicize the contents of each undertaking to the public, invite people from all walks of life to visit, and make practical publicity to arouse widespread sympathy. (3) Prepare a budget for unified planning and unified expenditure, and use it as material for a large-scale fundraising campaign from society. (4) Please have people from all walks of life purchase and customize the handicrafts produced by each undertaking. (5) Please have the French Concession authorities allocate a small portion of the repeatedly increased donations and taxes as effective subsidies. I firmly believe that with the large number, strong power, and firm unity of Catholics in Shanghai, if they put into practice sacrificing a small part of their material and spiritual resources for the sake of the Lord in order to arouse the sympathy of non-Catholics, then the financial difficulties of these many Catholic charitable undertakings will be easily resolved. (Editor's note: The various good deeds run by the Catholic Church in this city, such as hospitals, clinics, nurseries, Puyutang, etc., are currently feeling extremely strained. If we do not plan comprehensively as soon as possible, how can we cope with them temporarily? This newspaper has long felt the same way. I hope that enthusiastic Catholics will rise up and cooperate to jointly find a way to organize a powerful committee. The future of charitable undertakings depends on this.)</p>
