<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>米價平議</h3>
<p>— 張雲搏</p>
<p>在立論前，有必須鄭車聲明者三：一·米的需要供給關係，通常必以全國生產消耗關係爲根據。本文限於篇幅，僅就上海一隅，作狹隘的推論。二·造成米價上漲的現象，是多方面的，譬如一方是吃米者，另一方是管米者，雙方立塲不同，見解又屬分歧，爲求比較切實公尤起見，不得不用執兩用中的衡量。三·三年來上海的米價，有限價，有黑市價，公家統計，禁用黑市，私人記載，叉多殘缺，而且關於米的來源及徵用等，大都秘而不宣。故本文取材，多係根據推論，益以耳目所及，謬誤掛漏，殆不能免，幸讀者諒之。</p>
<p>上海自從戰後到目前，米價激漲的速度和級數，眞是出人意外。照累進率來計算，大約漲了二百倍左右，中間雖小無下挫之日，然一經站定，即便飛騰。夫物價的上漲，自必有其上漲的因素，物價的有漲無跌，亦必有其所以致此的緣由。如不能分析共因素，何能對症發藥。徒囂囂然怨天尤人，也不能坐待倖運的到來。欲明瞭米價上漲的原因，最簡便的，莫如先把其他物價的因素加以檢討，然後能看出米價上漲之特別因素。</p>
<p>物價漲落的第一個因素，是跟着來源的遠近而俱來的·本國不能生產或製造，而專靠外國供給的物品，必定最貴。本國可能生產或製造，而路途較遠的物品，必定次貴。倘生產或製造的地點相距極近，必定最賤。講到食米，我們既不靠洋米的供給，又無須長途跋涉，自遠省運來，那麼爲什麽在許多物品中，米竟占了高價的第二位呢？這隱藏着的因素，我們不能不澈底加以發現。物價漲落的第二因素，是跟着分佈的疏密而俱來的。譬如某種物品滯留在某一地點，這樣，其他地點，必然要用高價纔能買到它。如果交通便利，運輸暢遂，這高價便逐漸平下來，這是自然的因果律。還有變相的因果律，譬如某種物品，滯留在少數人手中，市價必然狂漲，一經出籠，價格立即下降。講到食米，從古以來，總是流通無阻的。梁惠王的移粟，漢　何的轉運，這是古時的例子。前淸的山陝奇荒，本年的冀北偏災，賑糧源源接濟，這是近代的事實。二三年來，上海受着最嚴重的米貴問題的打擊，可是四百萬人民中，究竟餓死了多少人，可見得時至今日，存米還不甚短少。至於囤積其他物品，固屬可能，而囤米則不然，因時屆春夏兩季，蟲蛀與霉爛交相爲害，不能久儲，而且前工部局取締積米，低價歸公，囤米的人，早已身受痛苦，何敢再蹈覆轍。縱有食戶預購，爲數亦不甚多，且結果還是吃進肚皮，無礙大局。那末，爲什麽米價還是這樣有漲無跌呢？這問題自然有它的間接的原因在。</p>
<p>筆者現在把隱藏的和間接的因素，坦白的加以說明。</p>
<p>一是捐稅及類似捐稅的費用使它不能不漲。吾國歷代雖常有暴君汚吏出現，而在食米上巧立名目，籌捐稅的，却不多見。這是因爲「民以食爲天」的古訓，深入人心，所以寗願在其他財貨上層迭剝削，不敢冒大不韙。一直到會胡軍與，創設釐金，纔有米釐的規定，但當時米價，每石約制錢二千文，所收米　亦祗制錢二文。迨裁釐加稅，食米列入產銷稅項下，抽稅並未增加。自此次戰事發生後，許可制度隨之而生，於是搬動出入，在在需證，幾與其他百貨，同受統制，在此種情形下，米價怎能不漲。猶有甚於此者，稅率例有規定，尙不難負担，而稽查巡捕，檢查丁役，則關口如網，一絲不漏，其　或倍蓰於公家所得。筆者有一舊友，在崑山務農，某日，囑田戶送米一石至滬，所經關口，不下七十餘處，每次扣留若干，抵滬時祇剩兩斗多了。照此計算，米價佔二百倍的高價，實在是事所必至的。</p>
<p>第二是官米數目，秘而不宣，作奸犯科者，更上下其手，從中作崇，使米價愈漲愈高。吾國的民族性，對於國家之徵用糧食，向來不表示反抗。明淸的糟米，每年帶徵，運入京倉。各地的倉儲，秋季收買，積穀備荒，人民多習慣成自然。要養成這習慣，需要一定的數目，與一定的時期，使老百妙耳熟能詳，一到秋收的時候，他們早經算定，今年應納糟米若干，應供積穀若干，再把餘米出　；得價若干。成竹在胸，心安理得，這就是太平的景象。現則不然，木國軍隊，需米幾何，友邦供應，需米幾何，既不見於公家文吿，又不許報紙揭載，使老百姓無從準備。叉因不知數目，奸商得借此造謠，說今年米糧大半出口，利用人民恐慌心理，抬高價目，以博巨利。在另一塲合，鄉長亦得借此迭謠，說本鄕應出米若干石，實則大半折價歸已，這是米價高漲的叉一原因。</p>
<p>作者以爲這兩個因素不除，雖用盡心思，想盡方法，米價終無壓平之日，愚妄之言，或可供智者之參攷耳。</p>

<h3>玻根維爾島東端　曾兩度展開空戰　日機轟炸卑爾拉卑拉敵陣</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營三日晨發表南太平洋方面之綜合戰果，為以此與自六月卅日美軍在倫特巴島登陸以來之戰果合計，則日軍所獲之綜合戰果如次：擊沉敵巡洋艦八艘·大型驅逐艦六艘、巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦二艘，驅逐艦四艘，艦型未詳者一艘·特務艦一艘·魚雷艇十三般，登陸用舟艇二十八艘以上、載貨汽艇一艘。運輸船二十九艘。其他舟艇五艘。擊落敵機五七七架、又擊毀敵巡洋艦三十九艘、驅逐艦九艘、魚雷艇十艘，登陸用舟艇十六艘、載貨汽艇二艘，此外並擊毀敵機二十一架。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某　地　日電：敵波特西哥斯某TAAA4AAA2型戰鬥機及統一式B24轟炸機約九十架、曾於二日未明及常日下午兩度空襲玻根維爾鳥東端日軍陣地，日機迎擊，當展開壯烈空戰，結果擊落敵機十架，餘皆遁去、日方損失飛機一架。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　新幾　亞馬常附近，一日曾有敵戰鬥轟炸機約六十架之聯合編隊來襲，日軍以高射砲火沉着應戰，擊落敵B24型機一架，B24型機五架，內有二架尙未證實，日方有十數人受傷，民房若千起火。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　墨爾缽來訊：西南太平洋麥克沃塞將軍之司令部頃宣稱：日轟炸機編隊，於昨日襲擊所羅門羣島之卑爾拉卑拉島之反軸心軍沿海陣地及船舶。</p>
<h3>谷萩報道部長　昨發表演說　長期戰為日獲勝要素</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩少將，於四日在宇都市發表演說，茲誌共大意如次：最近歐洲方而發生之事件，有反軸心軍佔領西西里島，義大利政變、反軸心軍轟炸軸心都市，蘇聯發動夏季攻勢等。太平洋方面，則有日軍撤退基斯加島、敵軍在南太平洋作局部之反攻等。英美方面認爲此種悄勞於彼相常有利、故於奎具克會　中大事宣傳，但其實際情形、此種宣傳極爲低調，觀其奈貝克之會談、則</p>
<p>充滿焦燥</p>
<p>之氣，毫無成就。蓋英美極欲從速結束此次戰爭，良以彼等實行長期戰爭，此就美國而鄹，如惡性通貨膨脹，物價高漲，民衆生活之困難、工潮及共產思想之勃起，資源資材及熱練工人之不足，配給之不圓滑，生產之遲緩，政府與議會間之衝突，官僚之爭權奪利，政治意見之衝突及政治爭鬥等等，共國内情勢決難樂觀，至於國外情勢，則因歐洲第二戰　問題與蘇聯意見之相遠，關於太平洋第一主義與英國意見之不能一致，使前方及澳洲對美國之不信任，凡此釉種，皆殊難解決之問題。余認爲</p>
<p>美國煩惱</p>
<p>之原因，大致如次：即美國硏究日本宣戰詔書之結果、已覺悟羅斯福等之帝國主義及侵略主義，尤其是統治菲律賓干涉中國等事實與日本之自存自衛政策絕對不相容、彼等並已認識日木縱一億玉碎亦戰到底之決意，故對戰爭之前途殊爲悲觀，但美國若放棄侵略東亞之野心，則日美雙方實無何等死鬥之理由，美國民迄今已對美國對日作戰目的發生懷疑，即羅斯福一派亦認爲此種情勢殊爲嚴重，故乃極度煽惑國民之對日敵愾心與憎惡日本之感情，企圖支持繼續作戰，一般國民則因爲繼　作戰，已忍受莫大犧牲，然一俟其瞭解日本宣戰目的後，其戰意乃立即削弱，尤以獲悉戰塲悽慘之實狀後，其消耗情形，尤北美軍事當局對外作戰之視失秘而不宣</p>
<p>秘而不宣</p>
<p>爲將阿　地方面之傷兵收容於阿拉斯加、由太平洋方面之疾病者多數收容於新錫蘭，不使返國與家人相晤，以蒙蔽其戰塲上之慘狀。又在台維斯等所獻策之對日宣傳方針，企圖分裂日木國內，尤其是離間軍民，此足證彼等對於日是本之國體　史，國家組織一無可知也，日本及日本人因戰事演成長期以後，早已團結一致，在日本確保大束亞共榮圈後，長期戰爭實爲日本獲勝之　一要素。羅斯福·邱吉爾在奎貝克會談後，發表之共同宣言中，　曾討論對日作戰與有效援助重　問題，舊事重題而大作發表，實爲可笑之喜劇。羅邱在平貝克</p>
<p>會談結果</p>
<p>決定由歐洲第一主義改爲太平洋第一主義，或許更由美國動員兵力一千萬人，再輔以英海軍兵力，對日本實行總反攻，以圖戰事若在今年中不能結果，則至遲於明年秋季予以結束。若論及對日作戰問題、美國或將盡其可能避免採取奪同島嶼島日軍守備兵有四千人，以二萬人來襲、因而傷亡一萬數千人之衆、彼等經此種經騐以後，故於進攻某斯加島時，判斷該島</p>
<p>日軍守備</p>
<p>兵為五千人後，而準備十萬人，此以敵方所公布美軍八萬六千人兵不血刃在基斯加烏登陸，更謂此等兵士曾受數月之特殊訓練，凡此足證彼等已預料日軍將戰至最從一兵一卒，故乃發動員此龐大兵力，但日軍竟不戰撤退，故彼等引爲憾事。蓋此可明瞭美國自知若不以二十比一之兵力出動則難獲勝，準此美論耕柏島有日軍一帥團，則美軍攻擊時需出動二十師團，若每師團需船三十萬噸，則二十師團共需船六百萬噸，無論從兵力抑或船舶方面而言，美國從陸上或海上進攻日本某一重要防終，可謂極爲困難。因此彼等惟有干劃從阡上基地。</p>
<p>實行空襲</p>
<p>預料五千公里　航力之重轟炸機出現並不困難，現日本上下可以一致，其總力增强、空軍戰力，努力防空之理由亦在此、至於所謂對渝方作有效援助云者，即指奪囘緬甸作戰而言、現東亞聯合軍總司令決定起用巴登、英美雙方在倫教與印督華維爾及渝方代表顧維鈞等舉行協議，或即爲準備此事，殊不知日本軍嚴陣以待，決對由陸海空三面來攻，緬甸之敵軍餉以鮮血之美酒及髑　之伴肴。</p>
<h3>芬蘭首相致詞　請民衆合作　國會秘密討論外交政策</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　據赫爾辛基來電：芬蘭議會三日上午召開秘密會議，全體閣員均參加，討論外交政策事宜。</p>
<p>芬京四日中央社電　昨日芬蘭秘密國會開會，首相林姆高美斯發表謂：芬人應聯合一致以求獲得戰爭之勝利及和平之確保，此乃芬蘭之目的，芬蘭首相以芬瑞兩國言語致詞，認芬軍在蘇聯前綫之決心扺抗、乃係全國統一證明、又謂：芬蘭之最後目標、乃係和平、堅定及一致乃爲必要之因素，於冬季作戰中，更須極大之努力。</p>
<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾在美　深夜坐待登陸戰訊　對西歐作戰意見仍未獲一致</h3>
<p>軍斯水四日中央社電　羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相、坐待英軍在加拉布里亞登陸之戰息，直至昨日淸晨一時，白宮秘書歐萊謂：當該項消息抵達美京時·羅斯福·邱吉爾二人已不勝疲憊，邱吉爾日昨與羅斯福之私人顧問巴洛克及美陸　　應局局　素姆。凡爾將軍晤談、渠復與美海軍總司令金海軍大將令晤。</p>
<p>阿姆斯特丹四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊、羅斯福總統及邱吉爾首相對於西歐作戰問題，仍朱獲得確定之解決，該項問題乃視爲英·美對蘇聯之　係最重要者，但邱吉爾首相對於在歐陸戰事　　英國兵士認爲最可怕之事，倘英人仍如前次大戰之死亡，　英人不久便將絕種。</p>
<h3>軍委會召集　政工會議　九日起在京舉行</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　軍事　員會爲檢討過去陸海空軍政治訓練工作，並計劃朱來工作之進行，以强化軍隊政治訓練，而期努力於大束亞戰爭目的之完遂起見，特召集各軍事學校機關部隊之政訓處長政訓主任，及各省市保安處第三科長、舉行政工會議：茲悉該項會議，定於九日起在京舉行。此次出席參加會議者，共有五十餘單位，尙有各主營軍事訓練　關派員列席會議，以謀政治訓練與軍事訓練之密切連繫。連日收到提案已達八十餘件，預料對於今後政訓工作、定有一番新計劃新貢獻。</p>
<h3>兩報道部長　拜訪林部</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電前日本在華艦隊報道部長鎌田正一氏，奉命調派囘國，由松島慶三氏繼任。四日晨十時半，新舊報導部長為就任離任，特訪宣傳部林部長，林部長因公在滬，由郭次長代表晤談，至十一一時退出。</p>
<h3>榮子恆任　第十軍軍長</h3>

<h3>日陸海軍部　昨捐款送漢</h3>
<p>漢口四日中央社電　武昌漢口自遭敵機肓襲，全國各地莫不予極大同情，紛綏　款捐物，友邦日本陸海軍部及大東亞省、昨特捐助省市儲幣各十五萬元，由漢口連絡部轉送省巿府，並致慰問。</p>

<h3>棉紗布登記　决限期截止　逾期不登記全部沒收</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　自國府行政院於第一七四次會議時，通過補辦棉紗棉布登記，限期十五日，定於本月六日截止，逾期卽依法沒收。茲以限期在卽，前往請登記之棉紗棉布商，日來極爲踴躍。惟邇來市上謠傳當局對於棉紗棉布商登記期限將予寬放，故有一部份無知棉紗布商，意存觀望，延遲不往登記。昨日本大使館事務所，於循例招待中國記者團茶會上，廣田情報長對此特加闡明。據廣田部長謂，日來市上流言棉紗布登記，當局將予展期，此乃無稽之談。國民政府，注主席於一日發表談話中，已有確　表示。是以棉紗布登記，於本月六日截止，毫無展期可能。日本方面當與中國　取一致行動，商民如逾期不登記，決全部沒收，並將嚴懲不貸，希商民密切注意，以免愆期受罰。</p>
<h3>義國南部山區　兩路激戰中　羅馬宣布放棄三城</h3>
<p>羅馬四日中央社電　義軍司令部四日發表戰報義軍已自勒佐，聖　安尼及蔭爾伏三都市撤退。</p>
<p>柏林四四中央社電　德軍當局對於英軍於義國雨部開始登陸作戰、始終冷靜觀之、而注意其戰事之進展、以觀其究係以佔領義本土爲目的之大規模登陸作戰，抑爲在歐洲結成第一戰綫之特別作戰。此次作戰英軍乃以五艘戰艦衛護百餘艘登陸舟艇，乘暗夜而開始，至三日黎明逐漸於勒佐巿北方之加拉布里亞州海岸地帶登陸、英軍登陸後，即遣其一部沿海岸北上，向西西拉市進攻、遂與軸心軍展開激戰，同時擁有多數坦克車之英軍另一部隊，則　束方進擊，當亦與軸心軍接觸　開激戰。據悉，軸心空軍已參加作戰，並已擊毀英軍多數登陸舟艇，軸心軍究於何戰綫阻止英軍及美第七軍果於何地企圖登陸，現尙不明。加拉布軍亞州乃山嶽重重少地方，極難作戰，該州之北端已入阿平寗山脈，高逕海拔七千呎，南部勒佐市之背後地區，其地形　於行軍亦相常困難，易於行軍者，僅有沿伊奧列亞海與第勒尼安海岸之道路及由勒佐市北去，西西拉方面南去密特邦多之鐵路綫，故防衛軍之增援亦相常困難。據觀察陸軍之進攻決非容易，駐於義國之德軍兵力雖不能發表，但可知由西西里島退回之戈林機甲師團，第十五裝甲師團及第二十九坦克車師團，則在義國內那不勒斯·羅馬兩市附近。據謂，亦有數師團待機中，義南部戰局尙有相當演變，方可入於正式作戰階段。</p>
<p>羅馬四日中央社電　在加拉布里亞之新戰事，乃係在山嶺地帶進行，極難獲得接近者，在該省之北部阿平寗山脈高達到七千呎，在南部方面自渡過麥西拿海峽以在來爾奇奧登陸即遭遇極大之困雞，敵軍之進路常自愛安尼安及泰爾漢尼安海岸前進較爲便利。該處繞於山邊及海邊之間，有狹窄之低地。在來爾奇奥有鐵路兩條。皆爲單　者、一向自特蝶格利亞沿路經過西西拉柏美，尼科特拉維佛、聖灣依斐美亞等，第二路乃沿愛安尼安海　岸以至密特泮托，此種交通之不便、對於守軍之供應阻碍甚大，而對於攻軍之前進亦有影響。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據倫教來電、路透社軍事訪員昨晚宣稱：德軍不僅在義北部，即在義南部各省包括加拉布里亞在内，亦大形增强其兵力，此事已有相當　由可信其爲屬實。另據華盛頓來電稱：該處所獲電訊小意反軸心軍在地中海方面總司令艾森　華將軍，昨日淸晨開始在加拉布里亞之勒　區發動之侵入義南部戰事中，現正充份利用　兵。</p>
<h3>日機聯合編隊　昨再襲建甌　熾烈砲火中完成任務</h3>
<p>日軍某基地四日中央社電　日陸軍機三日復往轟炸福建建甌飛機塲。使其滑行路陷於不能使用。四日下午，復以戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊、襲擊駐渝美空軍之游擊戰中之基地，廣東南雄及廣西梧州，在熾烈之防空砲火中，對其飛機塲設施加以轟炸後，全機任務完成，安全飛返基地。</p>
<h3>德在東綫實施　猛烈防禦戰　全部戰綫達七百公里</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　德軍常局三日就東綫戰况說明如次：　德·蘇兩軍現正於米沃斯及斯姆依至莫斯科及至斯摩稜斯克之各路間約七百公里戰綫上繼續激戰，斯摩稜斯克地區如羅哥布修西方有強力之蘇軍向斯摩稜斯克方面進攻，通過厄里尼西亞之蘇軍，亦正由南方向斯摩稜斯克猛進，斯巴斯特尙斯克基羅失及基茲德克等地之西方激戰甚烈，該方而蘇軍有自北方包圍布利安斯克之勢。　西夫斯克北方蘇軍繼續以坦克車及空軍攻擊中，又南方之蘇坦克車先鋒部隊已到斯姆伊。卡科夫西方之德軍正以坦克車隊進攻，進展順利、唐納資中流伊齊姆地區情勢無何變化、頓巴斯工業地區之東端，德軍止實行猛烈之防禦戰。</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　德國新聞社軍事訪員哈倫斯里本稱：東綫各焦點之防禦大戰，仍在繼續進行中，劇烈之情形，不滅於前、德軍之作戰方法、仍以彈性之防禦爲其特點，德軍自卡科夫撤退以來，在其戰爭巡行中，有二種主要之趨勢漸形顯明，第一爲改攻爲守，第二爲對於地域作相當之退讓，蓋因此種措施往往爲减弱蘇軍實力最有利之方法，德軍前綫各據點之收復，其原因即在於此，外籍觀察家認爲，一俟蘇軍達於力竭聲嘶之頂點後，德方或將表現更大之意向，但柏林有資格方面對此並不加以評論。</p>
<h3>聖城要人　分赴英美</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　倫敦悉被爲聖城之權威使者富　，已自羅馬抵倫敦。按　彌係梵蒂岡之財政顯問，渠之赴英，獲有英政府之許可，乃以財政顧問之資格前往倫敦。</p>

<h3>三國外長　將在美會談</h3>

<h3>巴黎巿中心　首次遭聶炸</h3>
<p>維希四日中央社電　昨日爲英法對德　戰之叫週年紀念，反軸心機數隊昨晨首次襲擊巴黎市中心區，據海通社悉：該機　均於飛行甚高時擲下炸彈，住宅區被炸受損最重，據目前所獲不完全之報告稱：已有一百人慘遭非命及二百人受傷，衆信於收獲此報吿後，此數將增　。</p>
<h3>黃司長　赴蘇州視察</h3>
<p>蘇州四日中央社電　陸軍部爲調査各地保安制度之現狀起見，特派軍務司長黃儀氏，偕同友邦金子大佐分赴蘇浙各地視察保安呆帳構及部隊狀况。前日晚·　氏蒞蘇後，四日　赴保安處視察，當由成代理處長及以下各官佐迎入。首由省長代表唐　長，暨成代理處長致　，旋由該處辦公室主任科長等相繼報告工作概况、並將有關政訓編制等各問題，即席提出討論，直至十二時許完畢。即由保安處設宴招待午餐，聞黃氏於五時許　蘇返京。</p>
<h3>建設大漢口　積極計劃中</h3>
<p>漢口四日中央社電　市府爲完成大漢口之建設，現正積極計劃中。記者特訪高局長、叩詢關於建設計劃。　談稱：全市擬建設第一第二住宅區，第一重工業品、及一商業區，一小工業區，一農林區，一農田區、及中心區。至於建設計劃，現正詳細硏究中。同時糧食經濟兩局亦正分別擬具增產計　，預料該項計劃實現後·漢市當另有一番新姿態。</p>
<h3>德軍「出血戰術」奏功　東綫戰局即將轉變</h3>
<p>繼續七週的紅軍夏季攻勢，把全部歐俄區域化成一塊燒紅的烙鐵。德蘇二軍冒着酷暑，以具爾格洛特，卡科夫地區為主　戰塲，依然展開極激烈的戰鬥。廿二日德國EP通信軍事記者史蒂爾佛利特將軍指摘紅軍攻勢的繼續性稱：「此次夏季戰爭尚無何種越過最高潮的徵候。戰鬥依然以同樣的規模及慘烈情况而進入秋季。」而在他方，自英美以次以至於中立國方面，則頗注意於過去七週中，自從奧萊爾收復後，在卡科夫附近肉搏時起，蘇聯的攻擊已徐徐表現一種遲鈍狀態。同時德方所稱的「出血戰術」（堅持防禦態勢以謀消耗敵人的戰術），業巳確實發揮其效果，故對紅軍今後以烏克蘭爲目標之進攻，頗致疑問。</p>
<p>德軍隨機應變蘇軍進攻困難</p>
<p>英國方面，關於貝爾格洛特地區的戰鬥，英記者史蒂特報道稱：「德國的軍力依然極爲强大，不失爲對於赤軍的威脅。其堅强性絕未遲飩，士氣亦極旺盛。關於蘇聯方面的消耗，土耳其的評論家艾克薩爾氏佔計蘇聯兵力的損失，至少達五六百萬。又據德方的發表，蘇　戰車的損失，每週平均二千輛，飛機方面，在七月問蘇　有第一綫飛機九千五百架，開始攻　的四星期中，擊　及炸毀三千七百架，蒙受極大的損害。瑞典的軍事專門家稱：「德國的所謂出血戰術，視蘇聯攻勢的緩急而隨機應付克奉成功。」在這稱狀況下，中立國方面觀測蔽聯的夏季攻勢將不能繼續至晚秋或冬季，待相常時機，或將先行收束。這觀測當然僅就德蘇二常事者而論。如以之與奎貝克會議相對照，紅軍遲早將停止攻擊而再取防禦態勢，或全而的停止戰事而進行英美所　的政治工作。蘇聯目　對英美堅持西歐第二戰綫的要求，在東部的德國兵力〇〇〇師中，至少須分散五六十師。依目前情勢看來，英美盡管宣傳得怎樣天花亂墜，但仍堅特其固定方針不變。</p>
<p>採取地中海漸進作戰，繼續聶炸德國本土。</p>
<p>消耗德蘇二國實力，至於登陸戰則僅以自身的利從與見解作前提。</p>
<p>可見英美根本不擬響應蘇聯之迫切的西歐第二戰綫之要求。</p>
<p>前據大英廣播電台廣播，反復聲稱英美蘇之問並無何種衝突，漠視蘇聯對於第二戰綫的焦燥，而一味誇大「蘇聯反攻的激化」，可知他們的目的只在使德蘇二軍兩敗俱傷。據美聯社電，在上述狀况下，德軍增派〇師至義國本土，巴爾幹方面亦在〇師以上，西歐方面則駐有〇師，嚴陣以待英美的光臨。至於在戰綫方面，並無抽調一兵一卒的必要，用得意的「出血戰術」以消　蘇聯。路透社莫斯科通信員哈羅爾特金氏稱：</p>
<p>蘇聯得不償失前途危險重重</p>
<p>「在束戰綫方面，蘇聯絕對希望避免長期戰。」</p>
<p>他指出蘇聯戰力不能持久。如上所述，蘇聯因展開第二戰綫的絕望而强行在東戰綫採取的攻勢、如其結果僅以大量的消耗告終而並無所得、則蘇聯將遭遇相常嚴重的危局。自幕夏至初秋以蘇聯的反攻攻勢爲中心的東戰綫，其重要性卽在於此。（翔：　自八月二十四日來京　賣報知）</p>
<h3>日海軍省發表　伏見大尉殉職　為追頌績昇級少佐</h3>

<h3>整頓浦江駁運</h3>
<p>駁船運輸聯營社成立另組駁運貨物保護處</p>
<p>上海駁船協助海輪裝卸貨物，然以散泊浦江，行商　船頗不便利，各用跑碼頭人專司共事，給以相當利潤，流弊所及，船戶受其剝削，逐日虧耗，以至無力修船，該業領袖陶　生奚德福曹武生等，聯合各船戶組織船行，開辦聯營社，運貨提高、務使船戶生活解決，行商僱船便利，雙方有益，業已開始工作。</p>
<p>又浦江駁船雖有望夜，然載貨時有失竊，外擋尤甚，各船主損失不貲，甚至運費不　賠償，運論開銷，日本油糧上海同業組合托載駁貨，損失尤重，明知船夥有串通賄縱嫌疑，然無從禁止，故毅然決然，先允許增加運費二倍，以俗船民生計，然後委托駁船同業公會負責組織駁運貨物保護處，以防止貨物短少，現聞該組合與同業公會業已簽定覺書，駁運貨物保護處亦已正式籌備，一俟增加運費之後，即行開始工作，僱用熟悉幹練之稽査員，會同請願　，日夜巡査黃浦江蘇州河內，專防流氓夥刦，並責令船戶負責保護貨物，如有短少，勒令賠償。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>讀「米價平議」</h3>
<p>我們痛感近來處理糧食問題，每况愈下，人民實在難安緘默了。產米區城的農民，辛辛苦苦栽稱了米縠，不得不以低價出賣：產米區城與我們都市裏的非農民，不得不以高價取得，造成這樣矛盾的局面，一言以蔽之，在乎人謀之不臧。所以，我們日昨兩次評述，須判明政治責任，當罰　明。今後糧食新機構，絕對重視人事整　。就在挽救人謀不臧的大病。</p>
<p>今天承衆張雲摶先生撰述「米價平議」一文，在星期評論發表。張先生雖不是經濟學家，却有深於世故，豐富的經騐，所指出的都是從事實過程中體騐得來，與理論完全不背，洵　執兩用中的持平之見。</p>
<p>我們同意他所指出的兩個原因：第一，搬動出入，在在需證，於是稽査巡捕，檢査丁役，振振有詞，關口如網，一絲不漏，米價高漲是事所必至的。第二，收買米糧數量與時期，未曾明白公告，使老百姓無從準備，而奸商遂借此造謠、從巾漁利。綜括要旨、還在人事問題、</p>
<p>現聞管理米糧新機構積極改組，深盼常局能抽暇檢出我們所發表的獻　，多多參攷，多多採納。</p>

<p>不採干涉主義</p>
<p>首由林部長致開會辭略謂：各位有上海不避艱辛、來幹話劇運動、而使能保有目前的話劇基礎、兄弟極表感佩。囘想過去沒有在話劇界盡力、故欲自今日起站在政府的立塲、爲話劇界謀開展。同時因爲話劇是文化的事業，也是民問的事業，故對於話劇界前途之發展，事業之推進，與話劇界本身之聯絡、尙要各位自身努力。在部方面當盡力輔助，絕不採取干涉主義，使話劇界能充分的發展。但無論那一種事業、都有一種計劃、有了計劃，才能按照着順利地推進，這種計劃是要諸位自己以共同的利益以共同的前途而努力。</p>

<p>評言</p>
<h3>以糖而論</h3>
<p>糧食問題，固然弄得一團糟糕、徒使民衆發生一種不良印象：以糖而論，又何嘗不是如此？兩個月以來、糖的配給竟等於零、兩星期以來、糖的價格，漲無止境、究其原因，聞爲糖價問題，不能與糖商合作　業處獲得一個解決，由是七月授糖延期了，八月授糖又延期了，一月復一月、延期復延　，以致囤積居奇者者、得以糖爲投機活動的利器，甚且傳聞公然以貨車載運，馳騁全市、旁若無人：在戰時物品統制之中，何得有此現象？</p>
<p>民衆當中，有許多人間着：棉紗布可以收買、糖何以不可收買？假令全市存糖，悉予收買、则計口授給，寧有問题？又有許多人問着：當局爲制止一時黑市之猖獗，何不即刻把七月八月的口糖，先行配給民衆？這樣一來，黑市糖價、豈不可以趨於直綫的低落？</p>
<p>總之一句話，配給必須有方案、有辦法、有把握，而後民衆在心理上，自能信任配給制度，在事實上，亦不至處處仰賴於黑市、則黑市之消滅、可期而待、至少亦不至於形成猖獗，這是配給當局的責任，不是民衆消費者的責任。</p>

<h3>故都的動態　新民會的活動</h3>
<p>率變後所組織的新民會、是華北最活動的一個團體·每年北京特別布都開有新民會市聯合協議會。本年的會部定於本月廿九日上午十時起在懷仁堂隆重揭幕。這一次的議案已經由北京市機會全體委員會決定，內關民生者五件，文敎者七件，行政者十件，其他二件，會議代表是由十九個分會選出，計五十八名，都是現時會論界，實　界和民衆團體的指導階級。據說王克敏委員　兼新民會會長，也將　身出席指導。我們除在報紙上，可以看到委員長的丰姿外，大約又可以聽到他的難能可貴的說論了。</p>
<p>維特風化問題</p>
<p>儘管在一衣食起居都成問題的時候」（王蔭泰督辯語）。華北的當局似乎對於「風化」的問題也並沒有忽略。最近因爲欲、大來了，各學校即將開學，北京的敎育當局就特別函請各維糖風化機關，對於學生的行動隨時加以監督。說是：一倘有學生着制服冶遊或作有傷風化之行動，應立即予以嚴懲，以免各　荒　學（語見八月廿七日實報，。但沒有着制服的是否可以自由行動，知並沒有提及。</p>
<p>防空訓練積極</p>
<p>爲　總備九月一日記八日間的華北全境防空演習，這幾天北京市就舉行了「防空訓練」，自本月二十三日起一這訓練了五天。所有北京市各警防分團，華北政委會，各總署，市公署，市署各局，以及共他各機關蓬體的特別警這分團，都在醫防區本部的指揮下，展開熱烈的　練。訓練的第一第二兩日是警防準備的檢點，第三第四兩日是術斜的教練和防空知織的請授。最後一天則爲監視聯絡的練，防火消火的訓練。前者就是訓練命令通報的受領，和防護組員的召集，後者就是訓練如何去處置燒　彈　下時所生的火警。除了眞些「官方」的訓練外，警察也照例的到各戶通知戶主要在門口放置一桶水幾　土，作爲防空之用。這一次比較新鮮的是除了水土之外，還得在玻璃窗上糊上紙條。據說經此一糊，轟炸彈時，爆發所震破的坡璃片就不會飛打傷人。大約是因爲「傷人」兩個字特別惹人注意吧，市民對此確是特別的感到興趣。於是，各處商店的玻璃窗上都糊上各種花紋的紙條，不但可以避免未來的「傷人」，而且「煞是好看」。有的商店所糊的花紋就好像是少女秋裝的布紋，退可以有廣告的作用。這也是一種戰時藝術的表現了。</p>
<p>中元鬼節熱鬧</p>
<p>中元節在北京一向都有道多佛教團體，慈善機關出來啓建道塲，普渡孤魂，廣賬餓鬼，其中最熱鬧的要算是北海的天王殿永安寺。以前曾爲各次內戰的死難英靈招魂，今年則爲大東西戰爭的烈士普渡。</p>
<p>據新北京報記者的　寫，當日的情形：「門前高高太牌樓，上書盂關盆法會……天王殿前乃昨日最盛之地，將近園門，已聞梵音滿耳，而經壇四遍，則滿佈着旌，隨風　揚，宛如列陣，旗分南北，色有紅黑，按四方五行之別，旅色各異，中央豎黃旗，暗示中央戊已土，　前海燈，照如白　，佛桌之前高擺果供，香烟繚　，置身其中，頓忘塵俗之念……殿前橫列五丈慈航，廣渡有緣之客。……永安寺則由菩提學會佛敎同願會主辦，規模宏大，秉意虔誠，而燈燭煇想，佛像森嚴，極爲壯麗。……　九時運燈隨流而下，岸上萬衆歡呼，與寺內佛聲法樂相應，別且一番風味，夜十一時始燒法船……。」（八月十六日）除了北海之外，法源寺，廣　寺，拈花寺等也都有類似的佛典，更有興味的是北京中央電合也特別請了鷲峰寺僧衆及鷲峰蓮社衆居士　請盂關盆經，在無綫電中，爲鬼超度。（學子寄，八月二十八日）</p>

<h3>米糧通統治方法之商權</h3>
<p>— 丁立凡</p>
<p>米糧統制機構有調整的消息，鑒於以往統制工作的沒有成效，我們敢在這新舊交替的時節，貢獻一種簡潔的統制辦法：因爲簡潔才可以沒有作弊的餘地，因爲沒有作弊的餘地，所以希冀他會一掃過去糧食的陰霾，爲國民生計謀一條康莊大道：</p>
<p>第一·統制的機構：由統制會在各縣市設置分會，秉承總會命令辦理米糧登記，收買，配給，運輸事宜；各機關所有與該會相抵觸之職權，一律停止行使。</p>
<p>第二，登記辦法：凡存米在一石以上者限於三日內向該地統制分會申請登記：凡搬運未執該會商可證之米糧及朱登記之存米，一經査獲，全部沒收。分會待登記齊全即將總數報吿統制總會。</p>
<p>第三收買辦法：已　登記之米糧，中統制會以頭號米每石八百元之價格標準收買之；收買時登記人僅須出具與登記數量相同之棧單，由統制會就需要時連同搬運這可證，押送船埠或零售米店。</p>
<p>第四，配給辦法：米店以其一個月零售所需數量向米業公會辦理配給申請，由公會葉總送交統制分會，加入各機關團體所需之特種理給，轉呈總會就各地供需情形作通盤運銷計劃，分令各地分會照辦。</p>
<p>第五，出售辦法：米店領到米糧即以每戶不超過五斗之數量以頭號米一千元之價格標準出售之　　此地所舉的不過是犖犖大端，辦事細則一時無從臆測；所謂每戶不超過五斗之數量亦須就實地統盯數字與以核算，就是收買興出售價格，也不過是理想中所最適當的數目，這其間二百元的價格相差，是運輸，米店佣金及各項開支費用，如果不足數，那末政府應以民食爲重，予以補助，絕不能再有增加，倘使有餘，就應該用來調整買賣價格，絕不能算作盈餘。</p>
<p>總之，辦理民食統制，是政府行政之一種，亞該是服務性質的，過去交給以營利為主的商人區辦，已非上策，而今後經該如何改進，自不待多言了</p>
<h3>八區公用車　增加車資問題</h3>
<p>— 漢</p>
<p>木日八區內之公共汽車及電車，自本月一日起，又增加車資了，且增加率約在百分之五十左右，有這當局勢力抑平物價　中，八區公用東的增價，將給予市民一個重大的　要。</p>
<p>在過去，舊法租界之公用車增徵，實較舊公井租界之雷車加價爲速，次數又多過公共租界，即以里程計費表而論，舊法租界的收費，亦較舊公共租界略高。</p>
<p>我們聽說法商電氣公司管理下的公用車輛，車資增加，一向是很自中的，不像一區那樣要經過監督的機關許可，因此，八　的車資，幾有兩月一加的趨勢，（上一次的加價是六月一日）。</p>
<p>公用車加價，連帶人　車價亦飛漲，目前的人力車，一箭之遙。車費動　需索五元十元，其　漲原因固多，但公共汽車與電車之常常加價，實爲利們深盼當局，能在百忙中，撥冗來注意這個公共車增資問題，從　重信蓄核車公司的　册，看它的收代表是否適當，限制其非法和潤，同時規定不得自由增加車資，嚴厲監督公用車　業，則民生幸甚，民行幸甚。</p>

<h3>米價平議</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yunbo</p>
<p>Before starting the discussion, there are three things that must be clearly stated: 1. The relationship between the need and supply of rice is usually based on the national production and consumption relationship. This article is limited in length and only makes a narrow inference on a corner of Shanghai. 2. There are many aspects to the phenomenon of rising rice prices. For example, one side is the rice eater, and the other side is the rice manager. The two sides have different positions, and their views are also divided. In order to be more realistic and fair, a balanced measure must be used. 3. In the past three years, rice prices in Shanghai have had price limits and black market prices. Official statistics prohibit the use of black markets, and private records are often incomplete. Moreover, the sources and requisition of rice are mostly kept secret. Therefore, the material in this article is mostly based on inference, supplemented by what I have seen and heard. Errors and omissions are probably unavoidable. I hope the reader will understand.</p>
<p>Since the war, the speed and level of the surge in rice prices in Shanghai have been truly unexpected. Calculated by the progressive rate, it has risen about two hundred times. Although there is no day of small declines in the middle, once it stabilizes, it will soar. The rise in prices must have its rising factors, and the fact that prices only rise and do not fall must also have its reasons. If the common factors cannot be analyzed, how can the right medicine be prescribed? Complaining and blaming others will not help, nor can we sit and wait for good luck to come. To understand the reasons for the rise in rice prices, the easiest way is to first examine the factors of other commodity prices, and then you can see the special factors of the rise in rice prices.</p>
<p>The first factor in the rise and fall of prices is the distance of the source. Goods that cannot be produced or manufactured in the country and rely solely on foreign supply must be the most expensive. Goods that can be produced or manufactured in the country but are farther away must be the next most expensive. If the production or manufacturing location is very close, it must be the cheapest. When it comes to rice, we neither rely on the supply of foreign rice, nor do we need to travel long distances to transport it from distant provinces. So why does rice rank second in price among many commodities? We must thoroughly discover the hidden factors. The second factor in the rise and fall of prices is the density of distribution. For example, if a certain item is滞留在a certain place, other places must use high prices to buy it. If transportation is convenient and smooth, the high price will gradually flatten out. This is a natural law of cause and effect. There is also a 변상의因果律, for example, if a certain item is滞留在the hands of a few people, the market price will inevitably skyrocket. Once it is released, the price will immediately drop. When it comes to rice, it has always been流通無阻. King Hui of Liang's移粟, Han 何's 轉運, these are ancient examples. The great famine in Shanxi and Shaanxi during the late Qing Dynasty, and the recent disaster in northern Hebei this year, with relief grain being delivered continuously, these are modern facts. In the past two or three years, Shanghai has been hit by the most serious problem of expensive rice, but how many people have actually starved to death among the four million people? It can be seen that even today, rice stocks are not very short. As for囤積other goods, it is certainly possible, but囤積rice is not, because in the spring and summer seasons, insects and mold are harmful to each other, and it cannot be stored for a long time. Moreover, the former 工部局 cracked down on積米and归公at a low price. People who囤積rice have already suffered, so how dare they repeat the same mistakes. Even if some食戶pre-purchase, the number is not very large, and the result is still eating into the stomach, which does not hinder the overall situation. So why is the price of rice still rising? This problem naturally has its indirect causes.</p>
<p>The author will now frankly explain the hidden and indirect factors.</p>
<p>First, taxes and similar tax-related expenses make it impossible for it not to rise. Although there have often been tyrannical rulers and corrupt officials in our country's past dynasties, few have巧立名目to raise taxes on rice. This is because the ancient训of "the people take food as their heaven" is deeply rooted in people's hearts, so they are willing to exploit in layers on other properties and goods, and dare not冒大不韪. It was not until Zeng Guofan and Hu Linyi created the likin that there were regulations for rice likin, but at that time the price of rice was about 2,000 cash per stone, and the rice likin collected was also only 2 cash. When likin was cut and taxes were increased, rice was included in the production and sales tax items, and the tax collection did not increase. Since this war broke out, the licensing system has come into being. Therefore, moving in and out requires certificates everywhere, almost under the same control as other department stores. Under this situation, how can the price of rice not rise? What is even worse is that the tax rate is stipulated, which is not difficult to bear, but the inspectors and patrolmen, inspection officers, and丁役are like nets at the关口, and nothing can be missed. The taxes may be倍蓰於what the government obtains. The author has an old friend who is engaged in farming in Kunshan. One day, he instructed a tenant to send a stone of rice to Shanghai. The关口passed through were no less than seventy, and a certain amount was withheld each time. When it arrived in Shanghai, only two斗were left. According to this calculation, the high price of rice occupying 200 times is really an inevitable thing.</p>
<p>Second, the amount of official rice is kept secret, and those who commit adultery and commit crimes上下其手, making things worse and making the price of rice rise higher and higher. Our country's民族性has never shown resistance to the state's requisition of food. The 糟米of the Ming and Qing dynasties were annually徵,运入京仓. The warehouses in various places purchased grain in autumn and積穀備荒. People were mostly accustomed to it. To develop this habit, a certain amount and a certain period of time are required, so that the老百妙耳熟能详. When autumn harvest arrives, they have already calculated how much糟米should be paid this year, how much積穀should be supplied, and then put the remaining rice out to sell; how much the price is. 成竹在胸，心安理得, this is the image of peace. It is not like this now. How much rice is needed by the national army, how much rice is needed by the friendly nations, is neither seen in the public announcements of the government, nor is it allowed to be published in newspapers, so that the common people have no way to prepare. Moreover, because the number is unknown,奸商can take this opportunity to spread rumors, saying that most of the rice and grain will be exported this year, using the people's panic psychology to raise prices and 博巨利. In another 塲合, the乡长 can also borrow this迭谣, saying that this village should produce several石of rice, but in fact most of it is converted into money and歸已. This is another reason for the high price of rice.</p>
<p>The author believes that if these two factors are not eliminated, even if all thoughts are exhausted and all methods are tried, there will be no day to suppress the price of rice. These foolish words may be used for the reference of the wise.</p>

<h3>Two Air Battles Unfolded at the Eastern End of Bougainville Island; Japanese Planes Bomb Allied阵地at Vella Lavella</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the morning of the 3rd the comprehensive war results in the South Pacific. Combining this with the war results since the US forces landed on Rendova Island on June 30, the comprehensive war results obtained by the Japanese army are as follows: Sunk 8 enemy cruisers, 6 large destroyers, 2 cruisers or large destroyers, 4 destroyers, 1 unidentified ship type, 1 auxiliary vessel, 13 torpedo boats, 28 or more landing craft, 1 cargo motorboat, 29 transport ships, and 5 other boats. Shot down 577 enemy aircraft. Also destroyed 39 enemy cruisers, 9 destroyers, 10 torpedo boats, 16 landing craft, and 2 cargo motorboats. In addition, 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - A certain location of the Japanese army in the South Pacific - A dispatch: About 90 enemy fighters of the Port Moresby type TAAA4AAA2 and consolidated B24 bombers空襲the Japanese army阵地at the eastern end of Bougainville Island twice on the 2nd, before dawn and in the afternoon. Japanese planes迎擊and unfolded a heroic air battle. As a result, 10 enemy planes were shot down, and the rest escaped. The Japanese side lost one plane.</p>

The Japanese army calmly fought back with anti-aircraft fire, shooting down 1 enemy B24 type aircraft and 5 B24 type aircraft, two of which have not been confirmed. Dozens of Japanese people were injured, and some civilian houses caught fire.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - Melbourne reports: The headquarters of General MacArthur in the Southwest Pacific has just announced that a formation of Japanese bombers attacked the Allied coastal阵地and ships on Vella Lavella Island in the Solomon Islands yesterday.</p>
<h3>Reporting Director Tanihagi Delivers a Speech Yesterday: A Protracted War is an Essential Element for Japan's Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Major General Tanihagi, the Army Reporting Director of the Japanese General Headquarters, delivered a speech in Utsunomiya City on the 4th. The main points are as follows: Recent events in Europe include the Allied forces occupying Sicily, the coup in Italy, Allied forces bombing Axis cities, and the Soviet Union launching a summer offensive. In the Pacific, the Japanese army withdrew from Kiska Island, and the enemy forces launched a partial counterattack in the South Pacific. The British and American sides believe that this kind of labor is very beneficial to them, so they advertise it greatly at the Quebec conference. But in reality, this kind of propaganda is extremely low-key. Looking at the talks in Quebec, they are full of</p>
<p>anxiety</p>
<p>and lack of achievement. The reason is that Britain and the United States are eager to end this war as soon as possible, because it is really difficult for them to wage a protracted war. As far as the United States is concerned, such things as恶性通貨膨脹, high prices, difficulties in the lives of the people,工潮and the rise of communist thought, insufficient resources, materials, and trained workers, uneven distribution, slow production, conflicts between the government and Congress, power struggles among bureaucrats, conflicts of political opinion, and political struggles, etc., its domestic situation is definitely not optimistic. As for the foreign situation, the opinions of the European Second Battlefront and the Soviet Union are far apart, and the opinions of the Pacific First Doctrine and Britain cannot be unified, which makes the front line and Australia distrust the United States. All these problems are difficult to solve. I think</p>
<p>America's troubles</p>
<p>are roughly as follows: That is, as a result of the United States studying Japan's declaration of war, it has realized that Roosevelt's imperialism and aggression, especially the fact that it rules the Philippines and interferes in China, are absolutely incompatible with Japan's policy of self-preservation and self-defense. They have also recognized that Japan is determined to fight to the end even if one hundred million玉碎, so they are very pessimistic about the future of the war. However, if the United States abandons its ambitions to invade East Asia, there is no reason for Japan and the United States to fight to the death. The American people have already begun to doubt the purpose of the United States' war against Japan. Even the Roosevelt faction believes that this situation is very serious, so it has extremely incited the people's feelings of enmity towards Japan and hatred of Japan, trying to support the continuation of the war. The general public has already endured great sacrifices because of continuing the war, but once they understand the purpose of Japan's declaration of war, their will to fight will immediately weaken. Especially after learning the tragic reality of the battlefield, the consumption situation, especially the North American military authorities' secrecy about foreign operations</p>
<p>secrecy</p>
<p>is to收容the wounded in the Aleutian Islands to Alaska, and to收容most of the patients from the Pacific Islands in New Ceylon, so that they do not return home to meet their families, in order to cover up the horrors of the battlefield. Also, in the anti-Japanese propaganda policy proposed by Davis et al., they attempted to divide Japan internally, especially to alienate the military and the people. This proves that they know nothing about the national history and national organization of Japan. After the war has evolved into a protracted war, Japan and the Japanese people have long been united. After Japan secures the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a protracted war is an essential element for Japan's victory. Roosevelt and Churchill, in the joint declaration issued after the Quebec talks, discussed the issue of operations against Japan and effective assistance to Chongqing. It is a ridiculous comedy to repeat old things and make a big announcement. The result of the talks between Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec</p>
<p>talks</p>
<p>determined to change from the Europe First Doctrine to the Pacific First Doctrine, or to mobilize 10 million troops in the United States, supplemented by the British naval force, to implement a general counter-offensive against Japan, in order to end the war in the middle of this year, or at the latest in the autumn of next year. When it comes to operations against Japan, the United States may avoid taking islands as much as possible. The Japanese garrison on Attu Island had 4,000 troops, and 20,000 troops came to attack, resulting in 10,000 casualties. After this experience, when attacking Kiska Island, they judged that the island's</p>
<p>Japanese garrison</p>
<p>had 5,000 troops, and prepared 100,000 troops. The enemy announced that 86,000 American troops landed on Kiska without bloodshed, and also said that these soldiers had undergone several months of special training. This proves that they had anticipated that the Japanese army would fight to the last man, so they mobilized this huge force. However, the Japanese army withdrew without fighting, which they considered a pity. This shows that the United States knows that it is difficult to win unless it deploys troops at a ratio of 20 to 1. According to this, if there is a Japanese regiment on Tarawa Island, the US military needs to deploy 20 divisions when attacking. If each division needs 300,000 tons of ships, then 20 divisions need a total of 6 million tons of ships. Whether in terms of troop strength or ships, it is extremely difficult for the United States to attack a certain important defense line of Japan from land or sea. Therefore, they can only plan from the island base.</p>
<p>Implement air raids</p>
<p>It is not difficult to predict the emergence of heavy bombers with a range of 5,000 kilometers. Now Japan can be united, and its overall strength is enhanced. The reason for strengthening the air force's combat power and striving for air defense also lies in this. As for the so-called effective assistance to Chongqing, it refers to the operation to奪囘Burma. The Supreme Commander of the East Asia Allied Forces has decided to appoint Baden. The British and American sides held agreements in London with the Viceroy of India Wavell and Chongqing representatives Gu Weijun et al., or to prepare for this matter. However, the Japanese army is waiting in full force, and will definitely feed the enemy troops who attack from land, sea, and air on Burma with the blood wine and 髑髅accompaniment.</p>

<p>Amsterdam, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill still have not obtained a definite solution to the problem of operations in Western Europe. This problem is regarded as the most important relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. However, Prime Minister Churchill believes that British soldiers are most afraid of war in Europe. If the British people die as in the last war, the British people will soon become extinct.</p>
<h3>Military Commission Convenes a Political Work Conference to be Held in Nanjing from the 9th</h3>

<h3>Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth is Decided to be Limited to a Deadline; All Unregistered Will Be Confiscated</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Since the National Government Executive Yuan passed the supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth at the 174th meeting, the deadline is limited to 15 days, which is scheduled to end on the 6th of this month. Those who fail to register will be confiscated according to law. Now that the deadline is approaching, merchants who have been registering cotton yarn and cotton cloth have been extremely enthusiastic in recent days. However, there have been rumors in the market recently that the authorities will寬放the registration deadline for cotton yarn and cotton cloth merchants, so some ignorant cotton yarn and cloth merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude and delaying registration. Yesterday, at the tea party hosted by the Japanese Embassy Office for the Chinese reporter group as usual, Information Minister Hirota specially clarified this. According to Minister Hirota, the rumors circulating in the market recently that the authorities will extend the registration of cotton yarn and cloth are unfounded. The National Government Chairman has already expressed this affirmatively in a speech on the 1st. Therefore, the registration of cotton yarn and cloth will end on the 6th of this month, and there is no possibility of extension. The Japanese side will take consistent actions with China, and merchants who fail to register within the deadline will have all their goods confiscated and will be severely punished. It is hoped that merchants will pay close attention to avoid being punished for missing the deadline.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on Two Routes in the Southern Mountainous Areas of Italy; Rome Announces the Abandonment of Three Cities</h3>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters issued a war report on the 4th, saying that the Italian army had withdrawn from the three cities of Reggio, Sant'Anni, and Invermo.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities have always been calmly observing the British army's landing operation in the Italian rain area, and paying attention to the progress of the war to see whether it is a large-scale landing operation aimed at occupying Italian territory or a special operation to form the first battle line in Europe. In this operation, the British army began the operation with five battleships protecting hundreds of landing craft, taking advantage of the dark night. At dawn on the 3rd, they gradually landed on the coastal area of Calabria north of Reggio. After landing, the British army sent a part of it north along the coast to attack Sicily, and launched a fierce battle with the Axis army. At the same time, another British force with a large number of tanks advanced to the east and also came into contact with the Axis army and launched a fierce battle. It is reported that the Axis air force has participated in the operation and has destroyed most of the British landing craft. It is still unclear on which front the Axis army will stop the British army and where the US 7th Army is trying to land. The Asian region of Calabria is a mountainous and sparsely populated area, which is very difficult to operate. The northern end of the state has entered the Apennine Mountains, with a high pass of 7,000 feet above sea level. The terrain behind the southern city of Reggio is also very difficult for marching, and it is easy for marching only on the road along the Ionian Sea and the Tyrrhenian coast and the railway line from Reggio to the north and from Sicily to the south of Metaponto. Therefore, the reinforcements of the defending army are also very difficult. It is observed that the army's offensive is by no means easy. Although the strength of the German army stationed in Italy cannot be announced, it can be known that the Goering Panzer Division, the 15th Panzer Division, and the 29th Tank Division that retreated from Sicily are near Naples and Rome in Italy. It is said that there are also several divisions waiting for the opportunity. The battle in southern Italy still has considerable evolution before it can enter the formal combat stage.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - The new battle in Calabria is being conducted in a mountainous area, which is extremely difficult to get close to. In the northern part of the province, the Apennine Mountains reach a height of 7,000 feet. In the southern part, since crossing the Strait of Messina to land in Relchi, they have encountered great difficulties. The enemy's advance route is often more convenient from the Ionian and Tyrrhenian coasts. There is a narrow low land between the mountains and the sea. There are two railways in Relchio. Both are single-track. One passes from Teggiano along the road through Sicily Peme, Nicotera Vivofo, and Saint Eufemia. The second road runs along the Ionian coast to Metaponto. This inconvenience in transportation greatly hinders the supply of the defending army, and also affects the advance of the attacking army.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, the Reuters military correspondent claimed last night that the German army is greatly increasing its strength not only in northern Italy, but also in the southern provinces of Italy, including Calabria. There is considerable reason to believe that this is true. According to a dispatch from Washington, the small-minded intelligence obtained there indicates that General Eisenhower, commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Mediterranean, is now making full use of airborne troops in the invasion of southern Italy launched in the Reggio area of Calabria yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>A Joint Formation of Japanese Aircraft Attacked Jian'ou Again Yesterday; Completed the Mission Amid Fierce Fire</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army aircraft bombed the Jian'ou airfield in Fujian again on the 3rd, making its runway unusable. In the afternoon of the 4th, a joint formation of fighter-bombers attacked the guerrilla warfare base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Nanxiong in Guangdong, and Wuzhou in Guangxi. Amid fierce anti-aircraft fire, they bombed the airfield facilities and returned safely to the base after completing their missions.</p>
<h3>Germany Implements Intense Defensive Warfare on the Eastern Front; Entire Front Line Reaches 700 Kilometers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The German High Command issued the following statement on the Eastern Front situation on the 3rd: German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting along an approximately 700-kilometer front line, stretching from Miovsk and Smyyi to Moscow and Smolensk. In the Smolensk region, strong Soviet forces are launching attacks towards Smolensk from the west of Rogobush. Soviet forces passing through Elnino are also advancing aggressively towards Smolensk from the south. Heavy fighting is taking place west of Spas-Demensk, Kirov, and Kizdiek, where Soviet forces are attempting to encircle Bryansk from the north. North of Seversk, Soviet forces continue to attack with tanks and air power, while to the south, advance units of Soviet tanks have reached Smyyi. West of Kharkov, German forces are launching tank offensives with good progress. The situation in the Izyum region of the central Donets River remains unchanged. In the eastern part of the Donbas industrial region, German forces are implementing intense defensive warfare.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency military correspondent Hallensleben stated: The major defensive battles on the Eastern Front continue, with intensity undiminished. The German military's operational method remains characterized by flexible defense. Since the German retreat from Kharkov, two major trends have become increasingly clear in their war operations: first, a shift from offense to defense; and second, a considerable concession of territory, as this measure is often the most advantageous way to weaken Soviet forces. The recapture of various German strongholds on the front lines is due to this. Foreign observers believe that once the Soviet forces reach the peak of exhaustion, the German side may demonstrate greater intentions, but qualified authorities in Berlin are not commenting on this.</p>
<h3>Important Figures from the Holy City to Travel to Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – London learns that a plenipotentiary envoy from the Holy City, Father Meyer, has arrived in London from Rome. Meyer is a prominent financial advisor to the Vatican. His trip to England was authorized by the British government, and he is traveling to London in his capacity as a financial advisor.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Washington reports that the Vatican City Prime Minister is currently en route to the United States, and President Roosevelt may meet with him.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers of Three Nations to Meet in the United States</h3>
<p>Zurich, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – News received from the American capital indicates that the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will meet in the United States within three to four weeks, rather than in Cairo as previously reported. The participants in the meeting will be British Foreign Secretary Eden, U.S. Secretary of State Hull, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov.</p>
<h3>First Aerial Bombing of Downtown Paris</h3>
<p>Vichy, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the declaration of war by Britain and France against Germany. Several waves of Axis aircraft attacked the downtown area of Paris for the first time yesterday morning. According to Havas, the aircraft dropped bombs from a great height. Residential areas were the most severely damaged. According to incomplete reports, 100 people have been killed and 200 injured. It is believed that these numbers will increase after a full report is received.</p>
<h3>Director Huang to Inspect Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – In order to investigate the current state of security systems in various locations, the Ministry of the Army has specially dispatched Director Huang Yi of the Military Affairs Department, along with Major Kaneko from a friendly nation, to inspect the security and unit conditions in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and other regions. After arriving in Suzhou on the evening of the 3rd, Director Huang visited the Security Office on the 4th, where he was welcomed by Acting Director Cheng and other officers. Director Tang, representing the provincial governor, and Acting Director Cheng delivered speeches. Subsequently, the director of the office and section chiefs reported on the general work situation, and relevant political training and organizational issues were discussed on the spot until after 12 o'clock. A luncheon was hosted by the Security Office. It is reported that Director Huang left Suzhou for Nanjing around 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Active Plans to Build Greater Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Municipal Government is actively planning to complete the construction of Greater Hankou. This reporter specifically visited Director Gao to inquire about the construction plans. Director Gao said: The city plans to build the first and second residential areas, a heavy industrial area, a commercial area, a small industrial area, an agricultural and forestry area, an agricultural area, and a central district. The construction plans are currently under detailed study. At the same time, the Food and Economic Bureaus are also separately drafting production increase plans. It is expected that after the implementation of these plans, Hankou will take on a new look.</p>
<h3>German "Bleeding Tactics" Succeed; Eastern Front Battle Situation Nears a Turning Point</h3>
<p>The Red Army's summer offensive, which has continued for seven weeks, has turned the entire European-Russian region into a red-hot branding iron. The German and Soviet armies, braving the scorching heat, with the Belgorod and Kharkov areas as their main battlefields, are still engaged in extremely fierce fighting. On the 22nd, General Steel Freid, military correspondent for the German EP communication, pointed out the continued nature of the Red Army's offensive, saying: "This summer war shows no sign of passing its peak. The battle continues into autumn with the same scale and intensity." Elsewhere, from Britain and the United States to neutral countries, much attention is being paid to the fact that in the past seven weeks, since the recapture of Orel, the Soviet attacks in the fierce fighting near Kharkov have gradually shown a state of sluggishness. At the same time, the "bleeding tactics" (insisting on a defensive posture to consume the enemy's tactics) claimed by the German side have indeed played their effect, so there is considerable doubt about the Red Army's future offensive targeting Ukraine.</p>
<p>German Army Adapts to Circumstances, Soviet Army's Offensive Difficult</p>
<p>Regarding the fighting in the Belgorod region, British journalist Steed reported: "The German military strength is still extremely strong and remains a threat to the Red Army. Its firmness has not diminished in the slightest, and its morale is also very high." Regarding the consumption of the Soviet side, Turkish commentator Exar estimated the loss of Soviet troops to be at least five or six million. According to the German announcement, the loss of Soviet tanks averages 2,000 per week. On the aircraft side, in July, the Soviet Union had 9,500 first-line aircraft. In the four weeks since the start of the offensive, 3,700 were shot down and destroyed, suffering extremely heavy damage. A Swedish military expert said: "Germany's so-called bleeding tactics are successful in adapting to the urgency of the Soviet offensive." In this situation, neutral countries observe that the Soviet summer offensive will not continue until late autumn or winter, and will likely end at a suitable time. This observation, of course, only concerns the German and Soviet parties involved. Compared with the Quebec Conference, the Red Army will sooner or later stop its attack and take a defensive posture again, or completely stop the war and carry out the political work that Britain and the United States require. The Soviet Union currently insists on the Western European Second Front requirement of Britain and the United States, and at least 50 to 60 divisions must be dispersed among the 100 divisions of the German forces in the east. Judging from the current situation, Britain and the United States, despite all the rhetoric, still firmly maintain their fixed policy unchanged.</p>
<p>Adopt a Gradual Mediterranean Operation and Continue to Bomb the German Mainland.</p>
<p>Consume the strength of Germany and the Soviet Union, and the landing battle is based only on its own interests and opinions as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>It can be seen that Britain and the United States fundamentally do not intend to respond to the Soviet Union's urgent request for a Second Western European Front.</p>
<p>According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, it has repeatedly stated that there is no conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, ignoring the Soviet Union's anxiety about the Second Front, and only exaggerating the "intensification of the Soviet counter-offensive," which shows that their purpose is only to make the German and Soviet armies suffer losses on both sides. According to the Associated Press, under the above circumstances, the German army has sent 〇 divisions to the Italian mainland, and more than 〇 divisions in the Balkans, while 〇 divisions are stationed in Western Europe, waiting in battle for the arrival of Britain and the United States. As for the front line, there is no need to transfer a single soldier, using the triumphant "bleeding tactics" to eliminate the Soviet Union. Reuters Moscow correspondent Harold King said:</p>
<p>Soviet Union Loses More Than It Gains, Dangerous Future</p>
<p>"On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union absolutely hopes to avoid a long-term war."</p>
<p>He pointed out that Soviet combat power cannot last. As mentioned above, if the Soviet Union's offensive on the Eastern Front, which was launched due to the despair of opening a Second Front, ends only with a large amount of consumption and nothing gained, then the Soviet Union will encounter a considerable serious crisis. The importance of the Eastern Front, centered on the Soviet counter-offensive from summer to early autumn, lies in this. (Xiang: Selling newspapers in Beijing since August 24)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Ministry Announces Lieutenant Vushimi's Death in Action; Posthumously Promoted to Major in Commemoration of Achievements</h3>

<h3>Telephone Service Between Shanghai and Minhang Begins</h3>
<p>Although there are long-distance buses operated by the Huazhong Automobile Company running daily between Shanghai and Minhang, the Beiqiao Special Zone Public Office feels that it is still inconvenient in case of emergencies. Therefore, it has contacted various local Chinese and Japanese agencies and decided to install long-distance telephones. After several consultations, the China Zhongdian Electric Company was contracted to install them. The address is located in the First District Public Office.

<h3>Shanghai Tax Bureau Promotes Income Tax Collection; Those Who Did Not Report the Second Type of Income Tax in the Previous Two Years Should File Supplementary Reports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Income Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has been collecting income tax on salaries and remuneration from freelancers and others engaged in various occupations since January 1, 1930. However, due to the existence of concessions, the collection was greatly hindered. Now that the two concessions have been taken over, the bureau has been collecting taxes universally in accordance with the regulations. Those who did not report for the months of 1930 and 1931 should also file supplementary reports. If doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, as well as employees of various companies, factories, and businesses still delay reporting, they will be dealt with in accordance with the law. In addition, with regard to the salary and remuneration income tax of teachers and staff in major middle schools, the bureau has received an order from the Ministry that the tax arrears before April 1932 of various schools will be temporarily exempted, and the tax will be collected in accordance with the regulations from May 1932. However, those who have already paid the tax will be refunded. The relevant educational authorities in this city have been notified separately to order all public and private schools to comply. All withholding procedures should be carried out when salaries and remuneration are paid to each employee in that month. The taxes payable should be deducted separately in accordance with the tax rate table, and the second category of Class C withholding list should be filled out, and the tax payment should be directly submitted to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank for verification and transfer.</p>

<h3>Central News Agency Branch Moves to New Location Today</h3>

<h3>Rectifying Huangpu River Lighterage</h3>
<p>Lighter Transportation Joint Venture Established; Separate Cargo Protection Department Established</p>
<p>Shanghai lighters assist ocean vessels in loading and unloading cargo, but the scattered berthing on the Huangpu River makes it inconvenient for merchants and shipowners. People who run the docks are specially assigned to work together, giving them considerable profits. As a result, shipowners are exploited, losing money day by day, and unable to repair their ships. The leaders of the industry, Tao Sheng, Xi Defu, Cao Wusheng, etc., united with various shipowners to organize a shipping company and open a joint venture. By increasing transportation fees, they aim to solve the shipowners' livelihood and facilitate the merchants' hiring of ships, benefiting both parties. This work has already begun.</p>
<p>In addition, although there are night watchers for lighters on the Huangpu River, theft still occurs when transporting cargo, especially on outer wharves. Shipowners suffer significant losses, and even the transportation fees are not enough to cover compensation. The Japanese Oil and Grain Shanghai Trade Association entrusted to haul barge goods, suffer particularly heavy losses. Everyone knows that the boat people are suspected of collusion and bribery, but there is no way to prohibit them. Therefore, it was decided to double the freight rate to maintain the livelihood of the boat people, and then entrust the Lighter Trade Association to be responsible for organizing a barge freight protection office to prevent cargo shortages. It is now reported that the association and the association have already signed a memorandum, and the barge freight protection office is also officially preparing, Once the freight rate is increased, they will immediately start work, hiring experienced and capable investigators, who will work with the police to patrol the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek day and night, specializing in preventing gangsters and robbers, and ordering the shipowners to be responsible for protecting the cargo. If there is any shortage, they will be ordered to pay compensation.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Reading "Fair Discussion of Rice Prices"</h3>
<p>We painfully feel that the handling of food issues has been getting worse and worse recently, and the people really find it difficult to remain silent. Farmers in rice-producing areas painstakingly plant and harvest rice, but have to sell it at low prices. Non-farmers in rice-producing areas and our cities have to buy it at high prices, creating such a contradictory situation. In a word, it lies in the poor planning of people. Therefore, we have commented twice yesterday that political responsibility must be determined, and those who should be punished must be clearly punished. In the future, the new food agency must attach absolute importance to personnel reorganization. This is to save the great disease of poor planning.</p>
<p>Today, we are pleased to publish an article entitled "Fair Discussion of Rice Prices" written by Mr. Zhang Yunbo in the Sunday Review. Although Mr. Zhang is not an economist, he has a deep understanding of the world and rich experience. What he points out is what he has experienced in the process of facts, which is completely consistent with theory, and is a fair view of holding both sides.</p>
<p>We agree with the two reasons he pointed out: First, moving in and out requires certificates everywhere. As a result, inspectors, patrols, inspection officers, and corvée men are full of righteous indignation, and the checkpoints are like nets, without missing a single thread. The high price of rice is inevitable. Second, the quantity and timing of rice purchases have not been clearly announced, making it impossible for the common people to prepare, and unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to spread rumors and profit from it. In summary, the main point is still the personnel problem.</p>
<p>It is now reported that the new management of the rice administration is actively reorganizing. We sincerely hope that the authorities can take the time to examine the suggestions we have published, refer to them more, and adopt them more.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Propaganda Organizations and Newspapers Host Banquet for Minister An</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Office and various organizations and newspapers related to propaganda in this city, in order to welcome the newly appointed Minister An Wei Yi of the Nanjing Japanese Embassy Intelligence Department, specially held a banquet yesterday at 12:00 noon at the International Hotel.

The atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic. First, Vice Minister Feng delivered a welcoming speech. He stated that the Propaganda Department and the Japanese Intelligence Department have an extremely close relationship in Nanjing, especially after the Greater East Asia War, the relationship has become even closer. This time, Minister An has taken up a new post and is visiting Shanghai for the first time. We are very pleased and grateful for his presence today. Shanghai is a cultural center, and we hope Minister An will provide more guidance on how to progress in the future. Next, Minister An delivered a speech, stating that he is extremely grateful for the grand reception from everyone today. The current Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage, which is not only a military decisive battle but also a decisive battle in terms of ideological propaganda. As the newly appointed Intelligence Minister, I deeply feel the great mission I bear in this era. Nanjing is the political and diplomatic center of China, so the work in Nanjing is particularly important and carries great responsibility. Although I am stationed in Nanjing, I hope to have more opportunities to come to Shanghai in the future and ask for everyone's guidance. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and everyone enjoyed themselves before the gathering ended.</p>
<h3>Da Cheng Silk Factory Scholarship</h3>
<p>Sponsoring This Newspaper's Aid-to-Education Campaign: List of Winning Students Disclosed</p>
<p>Da Gang and all its employees have donated funds to aid flood victims and spared no effort in supporting this newspaper's aid-to-education campaign. This year, they have again donated 10,000 yuan, designated to reward the top three students in each level of the junior high school and senior high school entrance examinations, as well as one outstanding student from the textile and mechanical engineering departments of the senior vocational school's first grade, for a total of twenty students. It is stipulated that each junior high school student will receive 400 yuan, each senior high school student will receive 600 yuan, and each senior vocational student will receive 500 yuan. This newspaper will provide awards in accordance with the factory's regulations. Based on the results of this year's examinations and after individual investigations confirming the genuinely impoverished circumstances of the students, the following students are solemnly awarded: Junior High School 1st Grade: Qian Renlv, Cheng Yi, Liu Jiqi, Tu Chubin, Zhai Qian, Zhang Jinfu; Junior High School 3rd Grade: Ren Peian, Luo Yongnian, Wang Shimin; Senior High School 1st Grade: Tao Delin, Yang Shi, Pan Wenmei; Senior High School 2nd Grade: Qian Wei, Mao Guan, Zhang Fu; Senior High School 3rd Grade: Zhang Youbai, Tu Shanshen, Guo Qianrong. As the senior vocational school's wood department has been merged into the university system, based on the applications from students studying in the weaving and textile machinery departments, two students with excellent academic performance and genuinely impoverished family circumstances have been selected: Hui Qun from the textile department and Chen from the mechanical engineering department. In addition to the aid-to-education funds already paid to this newspaper, the above-mentioned students will receive additional award money in accordance with the factory's award regulations to show encouragement. We hope that the students who receive aid will work hard in their studies and live up to the factory's enthusiasm for rewarding talent. In addition to sending separate letters to the factory for verification, this newspaper will separately notify each student of the method for receiving the funds.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Divided Into Fifteen Districts</h3>

<h3>Theater Community Holds Symposium Yesterday, Minister Lin Delivers Speech, Striving to Support Full Development</h3>
<p>In order to emphasize the development of culture and theater in this city after the recovery of the concessions, Mayor Chen and Minister Lin specially convened a symposium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Huahua Hotel, 8th floor, gathering the city's theatrical community. Mayor Chen was unable to attend due to official duties, but officials attending included Propaganda Minister Lin, Director Ming of the Jiangsu Provincial Propaganda Office, Director Liang of the Municipal Propaganda Office. Attendees from the theater community included Xia Feng, Zhu Jixu, Zong Shan, Liu Ji from the Shanghai United Drama Troupe, Tang Ruoying, Li Xiaoyun, Tang Qi from the China Travel Drama Troupe, Wu Chengda from the Nanguo Drama Troupe, Zhang Fa, Mu Hong from the Yiguang Drama Troupe, and guest Zhang Shankun, Deputy General Manager of Zhonghua Film Company, totaling more than thirty people.</p>
<p>Not Adopting a Policy of Interference</p>
<p>Minister Lin first delivered an opening speech, stating: Everyone has come to Shanghai, braving hardships, to engage in theatrical activities, allowing us to maintain the current foundation of theater. I am extremely grateful. Reflecting on the past, I have not done enough for the theater community, so starting from today, I want to stand on the government's position and seek development for the theater community. At the same time, because theater is a cultural undertaking and also a popular undertaking, the development of the theater community's future, the promotion of its cause, and the connection with the theater community itself still require everyone's own efforts. The Ministry will do its best to assist and will never adopt a policy of interference, so that the theater community can fully develop. However, every undertaking has a plan, and with a plan, we can proceed smoothly. This plan requires everyone to work together for the common good and the common future.</p>
<p>Hoping for Internal Unity</p>
<p>The most important issue now is to demand unity within the theater community itself. No matter what difficulties arise, the Ministry will do its utmost to assist. In the past, due to a lack of appropriate opportunities, there was very little contact with everyone, so I specially convened everyone today to hold a symposium, hoping that everyone can speak frankly and without restraint, fully presenting the current problems of the theater community and the various opinions on the Propaganda Department's facilities, hoping to bring the opinions of the government and the people together. They then began to speak freely, and the meeting adjourned after more than an hour.</p>

<h3>Speaking of Sugar</h3>
<p>The grain problem is certainly a mess, only causing the public to have a negative impression. Speaking of sugar, isn't it the same? For the past two months, the sugar ration has been equal to zero. For the past two weeks, the price of sugar has been rising endlessly. The reason is said to be that the sugar price problem cannot be resolved with the cooperation of the sugar merchants. As a result, the July sugar distribution was postponed, and the August sugar distribution was also postponed. One month after another, postponed after postponed, so that hoarders can use sugar as a tool for speculative activities. It is even rumored that they openly transport it in trucks, running rampant throughout the city, as if there is no one else around. How can this phenomenon exist in wartime commodity control?</p>
<p>Among the public, many people are asking: Cotton yarn and cloth can be bought, why can't sugar be bought? Assuming that all the sugar in the city is purchased, then wouldn't it be easy to distribute it according to population? Many people are also asking: In order to stop the rampant black market for the time being, why doesn't the authorities immediately distribute the July and August sugar rations to the public? In this way, wouldn't the black market sugar price tend to fall in a straight line?</p>
<p>In a word, the rationing must have a plan, a method, and a guarantee, and then the public will be able to trust the rationing system psychologically, and in fact, they will not have to rely on the black market everywhere. Then the elimination of the black market can be expected, or at least it will not form a rampant situation. This is the responsibility of the rationing authorities, not the responsibility of the consuming public.</p>
<h3>Three Provinces Grain Depots to be Completed Within a Time Limit with the Principle of Storing Cooked Rice</h3>
<p>In order to uniformly purchase rice and concentrate distribution, the Ministry of Food has issued 500 million yuan in Class A and B grain depot bonds to purchase rice in various production areas and build warehouses in suitable locations in various provinces. The warehouses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been completed on schedule. As for the warehouses in various locations, they are divided into first, second, and third class depending on the size of the affairs. Here are the methods for building grain warehouses:</p>
<p>Prescribed Methods</p>
<p>The grain warehouse is responsible for: organizing and managing the purchase and storage of rice; inspecting and airing the stored rice; distributing and transporting the stored rice; receiving and managing the packaging bags; registering and reporting on the entry and exit of rice; issuing and managing the receipts and vouchers for the receipt and payment of rice; identifying the quality of rice entering and leaving the warehouse; measuring the rice entering and leaving; preserving rice samples; preventing adulteration and water in the rice purchased and stored. For the convenience of the current situation, the principle is to store cooked rice. When necessary, polished rice, indica rice, and other miscellaneous grains may also be stored. At the same time, the following principles are stipulated for the</p>
<p>Warehouse Setting Principles</p>
<p>The warehouse base must be in a place with convenient transportation; the base should be high and dry, and drainage pipes must be installed underground; the warehouse buildings must be close to the main roads for easy access; the terrain should be long from east to west and narrow from north to south; the base should not be close to other buildings; there must be fire and theft prevention measures; there must be pest and consumption prevention measures.</p>
<h3>Brokers Regulations to be Revised</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th) The Ministries of Finance and Industry, in view of the Shanghai stock exchanges having resumed the secondary market, urgently need to rectify the management of exchange brokers. The previously promulgated regulations, considering the current situation, need to be revised in order to benefit and safeguard the legal interests of merchants. Therefore, they have specially revised the previous temporary regulations for exchange brokers. Once submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, they can be promulgated and implemented.</p>
<h3>Material Exchange Between North and Central China: Section Chief Tokunaga of the Commerce and Industry Department Talks About Smooth Progress</h3>
<p>Section Chief Tokunaga of the Commerce and Industry Department of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, accompanied by investigators Nakagawa and Fujikawa, went to Beijing on the 26th of last month to conduct meetings with relevant authorities. The work has been completed, and they returned to Shanghai on the 2nd. It is reported that the meeting was quite smooth, and coal and other materials from North China are expected to arrive as scheduled. There is no shortage of coal in Central China this winter. The materials exported from Central China are mainly cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and wheat flour, especially wheat flour, which will be increased. According to Section Chief Tokunaga's statement, they will gradually start to adjust and cooperate to the best of their ability. The most urgent is the exchange of necessities. Coal production in North China is increasing smoothly, so in addition to supplying Japan, it can also supply other places' needs.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks had ups and downs. In the morning, they continued the upward momentum of the afternoon of the previous day. They were suppressed by those who sold off on Saturday. In the afternoon, it was rumored that yarn and textile stocks would also rise along with department store stocks. Most stocks rose higher than the previous day, and the shaken confidence was reaffirmed. Trading was not active. Yong'an of the department store industry was the target of operators, and a new peak since the current increase in capital appeared in the upward trend. It soon returned to around the noon price of the previous day, and then rose again in the afternoon in the buying trend. New-New fluctuated inside and outside the level. Guohuo rose and then slightly returned, and ultimately all rose. Zhonghua also saw a rise. Zhongzhan entered and exited the inner level, and finally stood firm. In the textile industry, Yong'an Factory had already risen in the morning and continued to rise in the afternoon. There was little supply for high demand. Zhongfang Xinyi also returned to the top after turning from strong to weak in the afternoon. Dasheng First Factory was flat, and the Third Factory rose slightly. The prices of Meiya, Wuhua, Meilun, Hongxing, Lunhua, Tianlun, and Dahua Weaving all remained firm in the fluctuations. In the new pharmaceutical industry, only Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory rose slightly. Zhongfa, Wuzhou, and Zhongying ultimately had the same prices as the previous day. Xinyi suddenly weakened. Xinxing and Kexue Chemical were still stable, but there were few transactions. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric had slight progress. Public Utilities, Shao Shang Lun, and Xiang Sheng Sanlun were all flat. Only the cultural industry declined. Shangwu, Zhonghua, and Shijie Bookstore all saw a slight decline. Yongxiang was flat. Qigong Paper first rose and then returned to flat. Jinfeng and Standard Paper sought balanced prices. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose again. Huacheng was outstanding. Dahua Match saw a rise. In the real estate industry, Xinyi and Zhonghua opened very strongly, while Yongxing fell slightly. The buying interest in the industrial stock Jiu'an was strong again. Xinya Construction was more than flat, and Dahua Industrial traded near face value. Sanle Industrial had an opening, and the market was stable and weak. China and Guohua Investment were also flat. The asking prices of Sanyou Industrial and Home Industry were similar to the previous day. Meilin Head, Standard Weijing, and Fumin Dairy all became stable and firm again. The price of Guanshengyuan changed little. In the financial stocks, asking prices generally rose. The buying prices of Shanghai, Zhexing, Jincheng, Yanye, and Dalu Bank rose again. Zhongyi Trust was flat. Bao'an Glass was searched for at 20% off. Renhua Cultivation was still flat.</p>
<h3>More Than Ninety Shanghai Banks Should Increase Capital According to Law</h3>
<p>In order to rectify financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance previously approved the standard amount of capital for financial institutions. If the capital is less than the standard, it should be increased within six months. According to a reporter's investigation, there are a total of 166 banks of all sizes in this city, with a total capital of 503,512,183 yuan. Among them, 36 have capital of more than 5 million yuan, 33 have capital of more than 3 million yuan, 37 have capital of more than 2 million yuan, 38 have capital of more than 1 million yuan, and 22 have capital of less than 1 million yuan. Therefore, there are as many as 97 banks in this city that should increase capital within six months. In addition to some that have already increased capital according to law, the rest are rushing to complete the capital increase procedures.</p>
<h3>Defatted Soybean Powder Shipped to North China for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>According to news from oil factories, in order to supplement the food shortage, the authorities previously entrusted various oil factories in this city to produce a large amount of defatted soybean powder. It was once rumored that it would be distributed together with rice and grain. It is now heard that the produced defatted soybean powder has been shipped to North China for disaster relief. Therefore, the people of this city will use various miscellaneous grains instead of it.</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>The Economic Office of the First District Office of Shanghai Special Municipality will convene a talk with the people in charge of various industry associations at 3:00 PM on the 7th to discuss the issue of balancing and improving prices in order to regulate commodities and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>
<p>China Silk Industry Co., Ltd. purchased 10,000 units of spring cocoons. The silk reeling factories have been set up in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuxi and are now in operation. It is learned that as the autumn cocoons of this year are about to come on the market, in order to enrich the raw materials for silk reeling, the company has specially dispatched personnel to Wuxi, Huzhou, Hangzhou, and other production areas in Zhejiang Province to purchase autumn cocoons after the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

<h3>The Movements of the Former Capital: Activities of the Xinmin Hui</h3>
<p>The Xinmin Hui, organized after the change of regime, is one of the most active groups in North China. Every year, Beijing, as a special municipality, hosts the Xinmin Hui City Joint Conference. This year's conference is scheduled to open grandly at Huairentang on the morning of the 29th of this month at 10 o'clock. The agenda for this conference has been decided by the entire committee of the Beijing Municipal Opportunity. It includes five items concerning people's livelihood, seven concerning culture and education, ten concerning administration, and two others. The representatives to the conference, totaling fifty-eight, are elected from nineteen branch associations. They are all leading figures in the current discussion circles, practical circles, and public organizations. It is said that Committee Member Wang Kemin, who also serves as the chairman of the Xinmin Hui, will personally attend to provide guidance. Besides seeing the chairman's demeanor in the newspapers, we will likely hear his invaluable discourse again.</p>
<p>Upholding Morality Issues</p>
<p>Despite the fact that even basic necessities like food and clothing are problematic (as Wang Yintai, the director of the Defense Bureau, put it), the authorities in North China do not seem to have neglected the issue of "morality." Recently, with the arrival of the desire [presumably referring to a desire for something], and schools about to reopen, the Beijing education authorities have specifically requested all institutions upholding morality to supervise the actions of students at all times. They stated: "If any students are found loitering in uniform or engaging in behavior that harms morality, they should be severely punished immediately, so as to prevent everyone from neglecting their studies" (from the Shishi Ribao, August 27th). However, it was not mentioned whether those not wearing uniforms are free to act as they please.</p>
<p>Active Air Defense Training</p>
<p>In preparation for the eight-day North China-wide air defense exercise starting on September 1st, Beijing has been holding "air defense training" for the past few days, starting on the 23rd of this month, for five days. All police defense divisions of Beijing Municipality, the North China Political Affairs Commission, all general offices, the municipal government, various bureaus of the municipal government, and special police defense divisions of other organs and groups are展开ed and intensely trained under the command of the medical defense district headquarters. The first two days of training are for checking police defense preparations. The third and fourth days are for technical drills and instruction on air defense knowledge. The last day is for surveillance and communication drills, and fire prevention and extinguishing training. The former involves training in receiving command notifications and assembling protective team members, while the latter involves training on how to handle fires caused by incendiary bombs. In addition to these "official" training sessions, the police are also routinely notifying households to place a bucket of water and a few mounds of earth at their doorsteps for air defense purposes. What is relatively new this time is that in addition to water and earth, strips of paper must also be pasted on the glass windows. It is said that after pasting, the glass shards shattered by the explosion of bombs will not fly and injure people. Perhaps it is because the words "injure people" are particularly eye-catching that the citizens are particularly interested in this. As a result, various patterns of paper are pasted on the glass windows of shops everywhere, not only avoiding future "injuries" but also being "quite beautiful." The patterns pasted by some shops look like the fabric patterns of young women's autumn clothes, which can also have advertising effects. This is also a manifestation of wartime art.</p>
<p>The Lively Zhongyuan Ghost Festival</p>
<p>During the Zhongyuan Festival in Beijing, many Taoist and Buddhist groups and charitable organizations traditionally set up Taoist altars, offer salvation to lonely souls, and widely relieve hungry ghosts. The most lively of these events is probably at the Tianwang Hall Yong'an Temple in Beihai Park. In the past, it had summoned the heroic spirits of those who died in various civil wars. This year, it offered salvation to the martyrs of the Great East Asian War.</p>
<p>According to the description by a reporter for the Xin Beijing Bao, the scene that day was: "A tall archway stands at the entrance, with the words 'Yu Lan Basin Dharma Assembly' written on it... The area in front of the Tianwang Hall was the most prosperous place yesterday. Approaching the park gate, one could already hear the full sound of Brahma, and the sutra altar was surrounded by flags, fluttering in the wind, as if in formation. The flags were divided into north and south, with colors of red and black, according to the distinctions of the four directions and five elements, each with different colors. A yellow flag was erected in the center, indicating the central Wu Ji earth. Sea lamps shone like white silk in front, and fruit offerings were placed high on the Buddha table, with incense smoke curling around, making one forget the mundane world... Five-zhangs-long 'compassionate boats' were arranged horizontally in front of the hall to widely ferry those with karmic connections... The Yong'an Temple was organized by the Bodhi Society and the Buddhist Samata Association. The scale was grand and the intention was devout. The lights and candles shone brightly, and the Buddha statues were solemn, making it extremely magnificent... At nine o'clock, the lanterns were carried along the river, and the crowds on the shore cheered, echoing the Buddhist sounds and Dharma music in the temple, creating a unique atmosphere. The Dharma boat was burned at eleven o'clock..." (August 16th) In addition to Beihai Park, Fayuan Temple, Guangji Temple, and Nianhua Temple also had similar Buddhist ceremonies. What is even more interesting is that the Beijing Central Radio Station also specially invited monks from Jiufeng Temple and lay Buddhists from the Jiufeng Lotus Society to chant the Yu Lan Basin Sutra on the radio to deliver the ghosts.

<h3>Discussion on the Method of Grain Control</h3>
<p>— Ding Lifan</p>
<p>There is news of adjustments to the grain control organization. Given the ineffectiveness of past control efforts, we dare to contribute a simple control method during this transition from old to new: because simplicity leaves no room for corruption, and because there is no room for corruption, we hope that it will sweep away the past gloom of grain issues and seek a prosperous path for the people's livelihood:</p>
<p>First, the control organization: The control association should establish branches in each county and city to carry out grain registration, purchase, allocation, and transportation matters according to the orders of the general association. All powers of other organs that conflict with the association's powers should be suspended.</p>
<p>Second, registration method: Anyone with more than one dan (石) of grain must apply to the local control branch for registration within three days. Anyone transporting unregistered grain or grain without the association's permission will have all the grain confiscated upon discovery. After completing the registration, the branch should report the total amount to the general control association.</p>
<p>Third, purchase method: The control association should purchase the registered grain at a price of 800 yuan per dan (石) for first-grade rice. During the purchase, the registrant only needs to provide a warehouse receipt with the same quantity as the registered amount. The control association will then, when needed, send it together with a transportation permit to the wharf or retail rice store.</p>
<p>Fourth, allocation method: Rice stores should apply to the rice industry association for allocation based on their monthly retail needs. The association should submit the application to the control branch, adding the special allocation required by various organizations and groups, and then submit it to the general association for a comprehensive sales plan based on the supply and demand situation in various regions. The general association should then order the local branches to implement the plan.</p>
<p>Fifth, sales method: Rice stores, upon receiving the grain, should sell it at a price of 1,000 yuan per dan for first-grade rice, with a limit of no more than five dou (斗) per household.</p>
<p>What has been mentioned here are only the broad outlines. The detailed rules of operation cannot be speculated for the moment. The so-called quantity of no more than five dou per household must be verified based on the actual statistical figures. Even the purchase and sale prices are only the most appropriate numbers in the ideal situation. The 200 yuan price difference in between is for transportation, rice store commissions, and various expenses. If it is insufficient, then the government should prioritize the people's food and provide subsidies, and there must be no further increases. If there is a surplus, it should be used to adjust the buying and selling prices and should not be counted as profit.</p>
<p>In short, managing the people's food control is a kind of government administration and should be of a service nature. In the past, it was handed over to merchants who mainly focused on making profits, which was not the best policy. How it should be improved in the future is self-evident.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Increasing Fares on Public Buses in the Eighth District</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>Since the first of this month, the fares for public buses and trams in the Eighth District have increased again, with an increase rate of approximately 50%. Amid the authorities' efforts to suppress price increases, the fare increase of public transport in the Eighth District will have a significant impact on citizens.</p>
<p>In the past, the public transport fare increases in the former French Concession were faster, more frequent, and slightly higher than those in the former International Settlement, even in terms of mileage-based fare tables.</p>
<p>We have heard that the fare increases for public transport vehicles managed by the French Electric Company have always been very autonomous, unlike in the First District, where they require permission from supervisory authorities. Therefore, the fares in the Eighth District have almost been increasing every two months (the last fare increase was on June 1st).</p>
<p>The fare increase of public transport has also led to a surge in rickshaw fares. Currently, rickshaws charge five to ten yuan for a short distance. While there are many reasons for the price increase, the frequent fare increases of public buses and trams are a major factor. We sincerely hope that the authorities, in their busy schedules, can take the time to pay attention to the issue of public transport fare increases, carefully review the company's books, see if its revenue is appropriate, restrict its illegal profits, and at the same time, stipulate that it cannot freely increase fares, and strictly supervise the public transport industry. If so, it would be fortunate for the people's livelihood and travel.</p>

<h3>Method for Curing Athlete's Foot</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhifang</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen many people in the city suffering from athlete's foot. Patients have swelling in both feet, gradually reaching the knees, and their walking is stiff. If treated improperly, it is difficult to recover and may endanger life. I have suffered from this disease myself and was treated by both Chinese and Western doctors, but the medicine was ineffective after more than forty days. Later, I was told of a folk remedy: cook red beans until soft and eat them as rice. After eating them for three consecutive days, the swelling in both feet completely subsided. I felt weak in both feet at the time, but after a few days of rest, I was able to recover. Furthermore, do not add salt or sugar to the red beans, and they must be eaten plain. Within three days, other than drinking boiled water to quench your thirst, all other vegetables and rice should not be eaten. You will recover after three days, and then you can eat and drink as usual.</p>
