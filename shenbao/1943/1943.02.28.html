<p>社評</p>
<h3>推進戰時民衆敎育　希望於全國教育會議者（四）</h3>
<p>民衆教育或平民教育，是動員人民力量，以貫澈政府國策的有力的工具。它首先是識字教育，我們曾主張淸除文盲，最有效的辦法是普及識字教育。因爲文盲不除，民智不開，國家無由反弱爲强，民族無由復與。我們要經過普遍的民衆識字教育，利用各級學校的學生及社會上原有的智識份子合力進行，掃除文盲工作，例如規定各級學生必須教會幾個人識字若干，爲學期考績的一種課題，庶幾在短時期內可以肅淸全國的文盲。</p>
<p>其次，民衆教育應該普遍發展補習教育。一方面使受過國民教育而感受不足者，授以必要的補充知識：另一方面針對過去學校教育的不足，而援予新時代國民必須的知識。這種補習教育，各種學科，務須於國際形勢，國家政策及社會需要，完全適應。同時，授以戰時必要的知識與技術，特別是基本的政治常識，以增進人民的組織力量，使有自治的與自覺的能力。</p>
<p>民衆教育的第三個要點，是要特別注重成年男女的識字教育，補習教育及技術教育，一方面使之識字，了解人生正義及對國家社會應負的責任：另方面使之善於應用學的改善其實際的生活。因此，識字課本的內容固然不能如一般小學所授，而須與社會生活及時事相符合，使在短時期內，知道讀和寫，而且還要獲得生活上的技能，使成為戰時生產或戰後建國的一份子。</p>
<p>為了這種要求，民衆敎育必須是：（一）大衆化的，凡是失學的成年男女，或是學力不足而有志進修的人，應該不加限制地歡迎他入學。（二）社會化的，卽是「敎育卽生活，宇宙爲學校」之意，一方面養成學生的團體生活，所學與其生活息息相通：另一方面指導其團結互助，改善實際生活及參加社會事業，愛國運動等。（三）通俗化的，卽一切課本及學級編制，務使失學者都來就學，而且獲得實際效益。所學的都能了解，能消化，能活用；否則所識之字雖多，所知之事全無，便又失去民衆教育之原意了。（四）普遍化，即不僅在城市中推行，而目更主要的是要向鄉村中去發展，肅淸文盲，提高一般的又化水準。（五）最重要的，所有一切的方法，其中心目標，應該不僅以辦了幾個民衆學校就算完事，一方面旣要利用白話報，畫報，壁報，淺近書刋，改良說書，廣播，公開演講，街頭的和挨戶的宣傳等等，以與民衆學校相濟相成，以提高國民的文化水準。另一方面還要以改革社會不良的風氣，促進生產爲重要的使命。</p>
<p>如何推進上述的民衆教育呢？在實施機關方面，首先，自然是普遍改善及增設民衆學校，各種補習班等，課程可視環境，學生程度及實際需要而定，師資可以利用各級公務員，學生及社會上熱心的智識份子。其次是設立民衆教育館，普通可分演講，展覽，圖書，並附設民衆學校，民衆茶園，及民衆診療所，工藝訓練班等，特別注重幫助民衆解決實際問題。不過，爲着過去民衆教育館專在館內辦事，今後應使民衆教育深入民間，名符其實。他如民衆圖書館，民衆體育塲，公共閱報處，民衆游藝塲，巡迥書報隊等，可視各地環境與實際需要而定。此外，我們特別要提到的，是過去民衆教育時常受政治環境的限制。我們認爲賢明的政府，應給發展民衆教育以優良的政治環境，集中各方面有志人士，指定充足的經費，有計劃有組織的推進民衆教育。一方面保障辦民教者不受政治上人事更動的影響，另一方面也斷絕教育工作者　緣入政的機會。而在社會方面，更應協助政府出力出錢，在政府指導之下，普遍發展民衆教育。很顯然的，如圖書館，博物館，動植物院，民衆劇塲，民衆運動塲，以及各種補習教育等，單靠政府的力量，特別是在目前戰時狀態下是不可能的，政府應該迅定獎勵民間有志人士，出力出綫，推進民衆教育的辦法，務使上下合力，掃除全國文盲，提高民衆文化水準，在戰時達到集中民力，實現「總力參戰」。更希望能在戰後發展民力，完成新中國的建設，這一點盼望本屆全國教育會議善爲策勵。</p>

<h3>義大利的總力戰態勢</h3>
<p>因蘇聯戰綫的重要性，地中海情勢的日趨緊迫化使法西斯義大利進入完全的總力戰態勢，尤其在政治、軍事、外交各方面，更不能不施行强有力的戰事政策。義國今後的歸趨如何？準備如何？布最近的動熊中，漸形表面化。</p>
<p>義國內閣大改組以後，戰時政策的新局面，大體可概述如下：</p>
<p>首先在政治方面，自二月五日第一次發表主要閣員的更迭以至今日，計新任大臣十名，次官級十一名，上院議員三十四名，法西斯評議員十名，地方知事二十一名，爲法西斯蒂執政以來規模最大的調勸。墨索里尼首相在義國參戰之初，即有此意，茲以時局的急轉直下　終於實施。實質上，可以說是野無遺賢的國家總勁員內閣。墨索里尼自兼內政、外交、陸、海、空五大臣之要戳。此舉所與吾人之印象，是從自主獨往的大政策出發，以期完成勝利。</p>
<p>墨索里尼的回任外相，爲外交方面最大的事件。我們參照目前義國國際地位的重要，可以推測未來義國的新外交政　將有　大的發展。　　　　亞諾伯爵之被任駐敎廷大使　更堪重視。此爲墨索里尼外交的第一聲，由此可以推測因與教廷外交的協力，其情勢將漸趨活潑化。</p>
<p>第二、法西斯蒂實力派弗蘭斯哥、貢達氏之被任爲達爾瑪奇亞總督、可視爲義國强化巴爾幹政策的表現。義國外交官中之雋才前駐蘇大使阿古斯脫，羅素氏就任駐土大使，亦可見土耳其，東地中海及巴爾幹方面爲意國新外交中最重視的所在。駐德大使亦將更迭，前教廷大使賴夫阿爾，伽利蓋利阿氏繼任的呼聲甚高。此次大戰發生以後，至一九四〇年方　參戰，　　　（　　　　主外交，　因此時機而發展爲德意一體的軸心外交，與軸心集團更加緊合作，在教廷，地中海，推進積極的自主的外交政策。</p>
<p>在軍事方面，素著聲譽的阿姆普羅奇奧將軍就任陸、海、空三軍總參謀長。氏爲義國機械化兵團的建設者，在巴爾幹之戰中頗著勞績。對阿比西尼亞之戰時，任巴萊爾莫軍司令官，在地中海方面遺兵如神，爲唯一的打開目前義國難局的適任者。在義國軍中爲幹部的披愛蒙台派，深獲義國民衆的信任，不過　政治，是一個純粹簡素的軍人。</p>
<p>在墨素里尼陸相下任次官　　　醫　　紅。　　　　　典型的武人本色。這一次軍部的調動，使統帥，軍政並皆脫離政略，而專從事於戰爭。</p>
<p>在經濟、社會各部門，戰時生活的强化不用說了，因此次總力戰態勞而實現的，如原來的軍需生產監督局，昇格爲軍需省，關於生產、配給、即使屬於陸、海、空軍部方面的，也全由軍需大臣統制。義國全部的生產，現在脫離民間的關係，爲軍事目的而動員。在新組合大臣之下，採取了所有的動昌方策，使今後的經濟生活經受軍事訓練，並將義國現有勞慟力二百五十萬，從速再予增强。（辦馬特電十九日發。翔：譯自二月二十一日東京朝日新　）</p>
<h3>蘇聯糧食配給現狀</h3>
<p>（庫比希夫特里二十日渡邊特派員發）戰事使蘇聯國民供出了很多很大的犧牲，其中尤以食糧問題爲最。實際上，蘇聯國民，自戰爭開始以後，食糧即在嚴厲的憑券制度下，受到極端的限制·原來關於食糧問題，蘇聯在以前曾有很辛酸的經騐，自前次大戰至發生革命時，會陷於半飢餓狀態。據當時的記錄，莫斯科，列寗格勒及其他大都市的居民，每日所能到手的麵包，不足五十公分，薄薄的一片，須用以充一日之飢。大都市中尤以列寗格勒最爲困苦。</p>
<p>食經的不足，必至於誘發反政府的空氣，蘇聯當局並未忘却這辛酸的經騐，所以對食糧問題常加以最大的關心。遠在德蘇戰爭開始之前，即已進行各種準備，戰爭開始後立即實施，其第一即爲現在施行中的憑券制。蘇聯憑券制度，有如次三特微：</p>
<p>第一，食糧品種類的限制或統一。現在食糧品的種類限制爲左開五種：</p>
<p>（甲）麵包，（乙）脂肪—牛油？猪油，酪酥，植物性油，（丙）肉，（魚亦在內）（丁）砂糖，（戊）小麥粉。</p>
<p>第二，傾注全部力量於上述各種食糧的增產及運輸，供給。</p>
<p>第三，有組織的實施這種憑券制。</p>
<p>蘇聯現在集中一切的力量於對德戰爭，他們的標語爲：「一切都爲了戰綫，一切都爲了勝利」食糧當然第一先送至前綫。戰爭無法使食糧的生產不低下，爲補救起見，蘇聯政府採取下述五種方法：</p>
<p>第一，完全禁止食糧品的輸出；</p>
<p>第二，　屬抑制食糧的消制；</p>
<p>第三，增加向集團農塲收買的穀物；</p>
<p>第四，擴充東部並西伯利亞地方的耕地；</p>
<p>第五，輸入一部分的食糧品。</p>
<p>在這憑券制以外，食物供給另有特別措施。去春以來，各重要工塲內設立類似合作社的組織，各工塲由此組織可得到一定的食糧的供給，或可以在此組織所經營的食堂中進食。憑券制供給食糧的數量如次：</p>
<p>（一）麵包每天的配給量—勞働者八百公分，一般勤務員六百公分，無職案的婦人及孩童四百公分。</p>
<p>（二）肪脂每月的配給糧—勞働者四百公分，一般人三百公分，婦孺二百公分。</p>
<p>（三）肉類每月的配給量—勞働者千八百公分，一般人一千二百公分，婦孺五百公分。</p>
<p>（四）砂糧不詳。</p>
<p>（五）小麥粉每月的配給糧—勞慟者千二百公分，一般人八百公分，婦孺不詳</p>
<p>如上所述，司見蘇聯的食糧狀態並不充分，僅足以保陣生活上必要的最小量而已。去年十一月記省訪間莫斯科時，有某市民曾有革命時代的困難經騐者會稱對記者：</p>
<p>「現在的食糧狀態，比常時好得多了。至少現在可以母須換餓，當然，我們現在不能吃飽，但爲了戰爭，不能不忍受這困難的狀態，我們現在已經可以耐受了。」</p>
<p>（翔：譯自二月廿二日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>德國戰時生活面面觀</h3>
<p>（柏林二十日大島特派員發）繼勞慟力總動員令，限制戰時不急要商店令，及禁止手工業令之後，財相芬克在德意志國立銀行總會席上又說明了增稅案。第二次世界大戰經過了三年半的戰事，直搗人力物力財力的底面，在柏林街頭，漸次顯現出全體戰爭深刻化的景象。前月十五日截止的第一次勞働中請，可視為女子的動員令。向市內各所報名的，自商工婦人及女學生以至於酒吧中的女侍女傭們，各階級的女子，都有前來投效。</p>
<p>商店貼出了佈告，暫行停業，戰後軍開。在熱閙的主要街道上，商店都拉起鐵門。其中汽車陳列所，上等陶器商，古物舖，文具店，糖菓店，烟紙店等，都已關閉。紮花舖變成蔬菜店，糖菓店變成食糧店，酒吧間變成飯館。</p>
<p>在出版界方面，原有各種雜誌二千五百種，現在凡是在戰爭上不必要的機關雜誌，週刋，電影雜誌，等都已停刊，自本週起新聞祗有一個最大的報道機關，政治，經濟，學衛方面的雜誌僅剩二百五十種。</p>
<p>運動界亦同被波及，職業運動如拳門，網球，哥爾夫球，滑雪溜冰，自行車等，今後將概在禁止之列。即應新事態的第一聲者，篇柏林市地下鐵道株式會社，有女子交通從業員四五十名，修畢特別敎育，而送至第一綫服務。</p>
<p>開戰以來，在男女職務的交替上，已有大半婦人占据男子的地們，成為女性清一色的局面。各工場亦趁此機會，除局面。各工場亦趁此機會，除最少限度的熟練之外，全部用女性及外國勞働者代替運轉。</p>
<p>各大學臨時休假一星期。自本星期一齊開始學期卒業試騐。學生們都因此中止學業而進出於街頭。國民都堅持勝利的確信，斯達林格勒，羅斯托夫的撤退，愈使每個人都明瞭今後將如何生活，以期勉渡難局，擭取勝利。這一次新的革命，由黨中右翼的戈增爾宣傳部長領導，先曾與希特勒總統熟商，並與三軍及許倍阿軍　部長，溫爾徵兵總監，曹開蘭勞慟徵發委員長協議之下，經詳密計劃之後，即將雷厲風行付之實施。（翔：譯自二月廿二日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>柏林二十七日海通社電　德國宣傳部長郭培爾、在最近一期「德國雜誌」上發表一文稱、目前乃西歐最艱險之時期、吾人之鬥爭實屬生亡有關，不但爲保護音人之生命、亦爲保障歐洲之將來、德國士兵在東綫作戰、誓必阻止赤禍之蔓延、歐洲之物質與精神、今巳逢到空前之危機、故德國已作總力之準備、此皆猶太國際之搗亂行爲所造成、不惜以種種卑鄙手段、企圖奪取壟斷世界之政權、但終未擭逞、布爾雪維克且欲摧殘西方文明、英美復助紂爲虐、致造成今日之世界烽火、倘在此種情形之下、歐洲不知力圖振作、則禍患莫大矣、但歐洲休戚關係、巳認淸此項危機、且巳有顯著之表現、故必能力保歐洲避免猶太國際之浩刦云、</p>
<p>柏林二十七日海通社電　德國情報副主任蘇恩德曼、近在「人民覜察報」發表一文、以「戰事不在德國沃德河、乃在密烏斯河」爲標題、檢討現行軍政局勢、略謂、戰爭現仍在東綫進行中，並未轉移至歐洲中部、德軍司令部所採取之戰略、業已阻止蘇軍潛入歐境、此次冬季戰爭所受之損失、自極重大、但歐洲之潔凈、仍爲德軍所保全、今後亦不足慮焉、</p>

<h3>「好官吏」與「好機構」　是收回租界及治外法權應有的準備</h3>
<p>日本的道義的大乘精神，中國民衆是否了解，姑且當他是今後的問題，我以爲日本現在交還租界，撒廢治外決權，這種歷史上現實的舉動，國府究將如何準備，接受這倒是問題的焦點。——</p>
<p>村上法律事務所的高田一氏，他用着冷靜中含有熱情的口吻，從結論上倒叙出上面的一段話。他又說：「充當好官吏的機構」，這是先決條件，可是有一句話說：「賈之維易，行之維艱」，解決困難問題的準備，也不是一朝一夕可以成功的。</p>
<p>據我的觀察，在上海這許多人裏頭，除了靑年們之外，對於交還租界撒廢治外法權，恐怕沒有人表示關心和同情的。租界是他們逍遙的所在，在他們的思想上，深深地印着這種習慣性，所以沈溺在這種氣氛裏的人，消磨了一切奮發的心志。然而這也可以說是產生在只圓個人利益和不信任指導監督機關的心理上的。換句括說，就是民衆對於從前政府不信任的消極抵抗辦法。這種專情，就像我個人所看得到的司法上，也很明顯，民衆對於特區法院，非常冷淡，所有訴訟事件，幾乎有多教由律師居中談判而解決的。那未中國方面縱然收同了司法權警察權等等，對於國府自身，恐怕只有加重困難，這些話或許說得過火，但是我很希望在交還之後，一定要準備有充分能力和超過現狀的人村和機構。</p>
<p>高田氏在中國僑居已有一十三年之久，曾經遍歷重慶等處。他又把昔年一段史話叙述出來，在這裏富有興趣的追憶裏，含港極深長的意思。他說。</p>
<p>長江上游，常常發生覆舟慘劇，大約在日淸輪船公司開關對渝航路的時候，該公司的輪船開足速率行駛，衝動了波浪，以致有不少民船覆沒，這種事情雖不足以構成華方的排日資料，然而日淸輪船公司本身却考慮用什麽方法來補救或者賠償。當時因爲不易決定，讬我研究這件事的善后，我就到重慶去當地調查，但是在法律上沒有辦法可以解決。後來我發覺這種覆舟事件除了船家自己去保險之外，沒有別的途徑，他們知道公司方面的誠意，同時自動去設法避免覆舟慘劇，後來就減　了許多覆舟事件。所以我對於覆舟這件事的結論，是認爲沈沒船舶是自己不小心所肇的禍端。</p>
<p>上面這些話，是表現了中國人民的一個性格，可見得只要慿現實去理喻，民衆必然心悅誠服的。所以要具堅定的誠意和極大的努力去準備這種工作。</p>
<p>希望國府，儘量充實準備來應付道時代。（企靑：譯自二月二十七日大陸新報）</p>

<p>最近租界當局行將發給雜糧購買證、惟雜糧範圍甚廣、至其配給、究屬何類頗爲各方關懷、茲據大通社記者探悉、本埠榨油廠所用之豆、品質甚佳、再將其煉純、製作粉末、其質味相同於黄豆粉、與麵粉無異、近已有大量製成、不久將由當局支配、是以租界當局配給雜糧、大概屬於此類、</p>

<h3>馬來亞縱橫談（五）</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>（八）馬來新姿態</p>
<p>新加坡馬來半島爲日軍占領以來，漸漸的確立了新的治安。</p>
<p>日軍將舊英屬馬來和舊荷屬蘇門答臘，劃爲同一軍政統治地區，由馬來最高指揮官統轄，而由馬來軍政監部爲執行機構。日軍統治的特點在使馬來與蘇門答獵之一體化，而在馬來半島內，則使直轄領的海峽殖民地和保護領的聯邦州與非聯邦州一致歸屬軍政機關掌管，在軍政施行上不設任何區別。軍政監部設於昭南島（新加坡改名），在軍政監部之下分設各部，各部之下分設各科一，分任所管業務。支部的組織一，設於原來各州，計（甲）馬來一方面，昭南特別市（昭南），（一括弧內爲政廳所在地，以下同，）柔佛洲（柔佛），麻六甲州（麻六甲），森美蘭州（森美蘭），雪蘭峨州吉隆坡），霹靂州（怡保），吉打州（埃羅斯打），吉連丹州（新高打），丁加奴州（丁加奴），彭亨州（立卑士）。乙）蘇門答臘方面：亞珍州（哥打拉夜），東海岸州（棉蘭），坦怕土文州（西馬魯），西海岸州（把東），利俄州（怕根巴爾），巨港州（巨港—怕倫奔，，占碑州（占碑），班庫蘭州萌古連），倫本州（的鹿勿洞），邦加勿里洞里（邦加爾比耐）。昭南特別市，在市長之下設總務，民生，事業，經濟，警察等五部，各州官之下，各依必要而設部科。</p>
<p>現在馬來軍政當局最大的課題之一，爲强化地方行政，日本籍官吏，現已達一百十人至三十人。地方行政的下部機構，是村，其組織與職務，不作重大的更動，軍政監部爲了加强指導，特在昭南設立「興亞訓練所」，爲當地籍官吏的養成所，從各州選拔靑年，施以短期訓練，使爲地方行政委員。</p>
<p>司法機構，也已允後恢復，審判處除了宗敎審判以外，施行高等法院及地方法院二審制，在軍政監部指導之下，任用一部分當地籍的法官，法律亦一承從前的原則。此外則有軍法會議，對危書及日軍之安全者，作特別審判。</p>
<p>財政方面，一九四二年度預算本部爲六千餘萬元，馬來各支部會計一億數千萬元（叻幣），蘇門答臘各支部會計一年約四千餘萬盾，總計二億二千萬元（盾）約合戰前預算額的七成。歲入歲出中，歲入以租稅，執照，鴉片收入，規例金等爲主，歲出以復興產業，恢復土木，建造木船，衛生保健及通信事業等經費爲主。歲人方面，特依軍政的要求與共榮圈的理念而實行稅制的改革。而實施於財政的根本方針，在於堅持「就地取給」主義。</p>
<p>產業方面，經濟建設的基本方針，第一要點在於重要國防資源之開發與取得，第二是對當地必需物資，可能的求其自給自足。產業方面的一切設施，大部份已於日軍占領之前爲英荷軍所澈底破壞，但經日軍書夜兼行的努力，一時停止的生產機構，總算先後恢復了，物資動員計劃和必要的生產量之確保，也開始在實現了。而資源開發工作者及交易担當者也漸次在日軍指導下到達，由日軍委托經營「軍管理」的工廠，鑛山，農園等。而特別汪重於馬來之錫，鐵礬土，及蘇門答臘的石油之取得與恢復生產。</p>
<p>對於橡膠，日軍占領時即設橡膠監　委員會，調查橡樹園之現况，收取一切存貨，並對各農園任命農園監理人，使監理及保管原有設施，而收取的存貨，則以最迅速的方法運回日本本國。其次，指導日籍的橡膠業者、成立「昭南橡膠組合，」統制馬來及蘇門答臘一切橡園的生產，運輸，收買及輸出諸業務。</p>
<p>橡膠以外的農業資源，是椰子，奎寗：樹皮酸等熱帶特有的產物，也努力求其恢復生產。又如南部蘇門答臘的棉花，北部蘇門答臘的麻類，也在迅速增產中。日本軍政當局在「復興馬來，建設蘇門答臘」的口號下，努力於這兩大南方寳庫的資源之開發。</p>
<p>馬來是歐美帝國主義殖民政策之下的典型的殖民地，只注意於橡膠及錫等帝國主義自己需要的原料賣源之開發，而對於殖民地民衆自己生活必需的食糧，却無自給能力，工業也不發達，自力更生的體制毫無根據。因此主要食糧以至一切被服，雜貨類，都不得不仰給於別國，在物資交換十萬分困難的戰時，自然有說不盡的痛苦。日軍爲此而努力於確立當地自給體制，作爲當前經濟政策的基礎。首先是食糧，蘇門答瞰方面，在戰爭前夕，曾有荷印政府提倡於前，日軍佔領後，已達自給自足之境；僅的十萬噸左右？需要從爪哇輸入。馬來的食糧自給率不過四〇％，其餘六〇%依存於泰國米及緬甸米的輸入。馬來軍政監部有鑒於此，自去夏以來，強力展開轄區的食糧增產運動，如開墾荒地，整頓灌溉設施，配給優良種子等，以期品質之改善，玉蜀黍，甘蔗，雜穀等副食物之增產，並努力於農業金融之圓滑化，獎勵優秀耕作者，設立農業硏究機關等，務求確保糧食自給。</p>
<p>鹽與砂糖，幾乎全部都依靠外埠輸入，鹽從泰國輸入，砂糖則靠爪哇供給，與外强業方面，也由日本專家努力倡導，以期增加水產食糧品。而在蘇門答臘北部則努力提倡牧畜業，以期緩和食糧問題。</p>
<p>衣服及其他日用必需品，大部份仰給於外部的輸入，在目　自然更感不足，而物價騰貴爲不可避免的現象。日本占領當局除了擴充當地企業强化生產之外，並努力於使日本內地與南方圈相互間物資交流之圓滑化，以期生活必需品之供應不缺。同時，爲對付物資之减少，一面嚴格規定食糧及日用品價格的戰前水準，抑制物價一面採用票券配給制度，以期節約。</p>
<p>工業部門之恢復，也漸以日本內地經營者之來臨而漸形活躍，橡膠·鐵板·製材·啤酒·玻璃·磚瓦·造船（木船）等各工廠，已相繼開工，不過都是小規模的原有工業的恢復，當地需要的一切物質，還不能不依靠從外部輸入，正式的當地工業之發展，尙有待於未來。</p>
<p>貿易方面，首先爲占領地區物資如石油，橡膠·鐵礬土·錳·鐵·錫·皮革·樹皮酸·椰子·等等之這邊　　　運送回國。其次，爲調查民需物資之最低必要量，然後從內地，滿洲和中國方面輸入，使共榮圈經濟連系具體實現。第三，爲南方圈相互間之物資交換，由緬甸·爪哇·泰國等供應米·糖·監·家禽·豚·雜糧等，而由蘇門答臘等供給煤·水泥等，利用民船輸送，又以昭南島爲中心，恢復交通機關，港灣設施，促進局地運輸之順利發展，而調整物資的供應關係。</p>
<p>金融方面，馬來，蘇門答臘的通貨爲叻元軍票，盾軍票與當地通貨即叻幣及爪哇銀行鈔票（馬來行使叻幣，蘇門答臘行使盾券），使軍票與當地通貨作等價行使，在軍票信用與通貨流通量方面，沒有特別不安的現象發生。不過，馬來爲舊英系通貨，而蘇門答獵爲舊荷系通貨的使用地區，在今日本單一軍政區域內的通貨有些二元的現象，其不便自可想而知，所以最近軍政監部實施馬來與蘇門答臘間通貨交換制度，努力從兩者間通貨之調整。金融機關，戰前新加坡的正金·台灣·華南三日系銀行已　復業之外，又在轄下各州開設正金銀行的「出張所」，而對於中國系印度某的銀行，有幾家由日本當局認爲無敵性的，也允許復業，而「平民金融機關」的當舖等，也已恢復，而且還開設了「庶民金庫」。</p>
<p>衛生方面，馬來和蘇門答臘，都在赤道綫上，而氣溫則較想像中的爲低，通年沒有特別不堪的酷熱。而日軍當戰爭吿一段落以後，立即努力於衛生施策，淸掃及整理河川溝渠，對住民實施普遍的種痘及豫防注射，所以戰後的衛生工作，也許比戰前更要好些。</p>
<p>敎育方面，過去由於英國統治者實施愚民政策，很不發達，住民中半數以上未受初等敎育，受中等以上的敎育的人，更是寥寥可數，除了華僑富豪所設的私校以外，一切敎育文化機關都爲英人包辦，以養成奴才爲第一義。日本占領者則依據「共榮圈」的理念，重視當地兒童的訓育工作，特別注力於初等敎育之普及，尤其是日本語敎育，收得了驚人的成效。</p>
<p>當地宗敎有回教·佛敎·基督敎等，日本佔領當局堅持不干涉當地宗敎的方針，尊重信敎自由，這當然也是收拾人心的主要方針之一。</p>
<p>馬來和新劃入馬來區的新姿態，大致就是如次。但是，未來光明的前途，還待當地住民尤其是占最多數的華僑同胞的繼續奮鬥咧！（完）</p>

<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>今後之中儲劵</h3>
<p>自去年六月上海之通貨經重大之變革後，中儲券遂爲很一之法定通貨。一切公私交易，皆須以中儲券支付之。荏苒數月。由新正而初春，物價金價股票公債，忽呈奔騰之勞。此爲中儲券信用之動搖乎？抑挾資者之庸人自擾乎？此中原因，姑不具論。然中儲券旣爲上海合法之通貨，爲人民生活所繁，吾人對之，自應有正確之認識。在最近之將來，依記者觀察，必有三種可能之發展：其一在上海雖通用中儲券，而窮鄕僻壤，尙未能推行盡利。今後政府必盡其能力以法令或其他强制力推行中儲券。中儲券旣可由內地銷納，則上海之中儲券可以减少。其二，上海可以繼續生產之工產品與內地可以生產之農產品，經通盤籌劃，而加以調整以後，勢必因供需相應，而壓平其價格。其三，軍票必逐漸以中儲券收回，市上將不見日本軍票。凡以軍票可以購買或支付之物品與款項，必以中儲券替代之，而將來日滙亦必惟中儲券可以結得。如日匯日益放長。至以百元易百圓。則中日之經濟水準，可以平均，而人民生活亦可相同。雖然，在此世界戰爭急劇之際，一切估計，均不能過高。上之所述，在事實上或有若干之距離，故亦不能過存奢望。總之，在戰時經濟下，爲人民者除忍耐痛苦而外，別無他法。</p>
<h3>華股市場　下週內可望復業</h3>
<p>華商股票市塲自上週四工部局檢查永昌，中國兩股票公司，以致牽動整個市塲停業以來，瞬將及旬。茲據悉，對於華股合法買賣，當局原無干涉之意，此次事件，不過因鑒於近頃各股漲風太熾，似有投機嫌疑，現已經當局檢查竣事，大約下星期內，定可獲圓滿之解決，屆時華股市塲，即將恢復正常交易。</p>
<h3>國府建設部　設駐滬辦事處</h3>

<h3>糖商合作處　配給公允食糖</h3>
<p>— 朱圭林</p>
<p>組織方面與管理方面</p>
<p>上海糖業同業公會前爲保障各同業所存之糖，蒙中支那票交換用物質配給組合許可將華人所有之砂糖，先行登記集中公售並合組糖商合作營業處辦理之，規定凡持有砂糖之華人無論行號個人皆得參加公售，登記糖計分六組（一）組砂（二）車白（三）赤砂（四）生砂（五）靑糖（六）冰糖，概由該處核發股權證書即爲該處股東至於未參加公售之糖經呈明軍配當局備價收買，至於施行配給各糖行享受之權額則依參加時之資歷與業務而分別規定，並爲圓滿配給食糖起見，實施分區管理將原有糖行合併爲五十八家，於去年二月起實施配給。</p>
<p>茲爲嚴密管理適合需要配給起見，將全市零售商所在地劃分爲七個區域指定糖行擔任配給及管理一切事項，各區域管轄糖行對於所屬甲乙種零售商之營業應依照下開各項，切實負責監督管理，並得在閱賬目隨時調查記載之。（甲種）零售商遵守事項，（一）門售應依照公定價格縣牌標明，（二）秤量應依天平秤爲準，（三）糖品不得攙雜，（四）配給食糖祇准門售，（五）每日存銷數量應據實塡報，（乙種）零售商遵守事項。（一）配給食糖祇准改製食品不得將原糖轉售，（二）每日存銷數量應據實塡報，違反以上各項者予以下列之處分，（一）停止一個月或一個月以上之配給，（二）請由警務機關依法取締，（三）取銷登記至於七個區域零售商，第一區甲種八二家，乙種五六家，第二區甲種一一〇家，乙種七〇家，第三區甲種四四家，乙種三九家，第四區甲種一九三家，乙種一一三家，第五區甲種一二五家，乙種五五家，第六區甲種六一家，乙種四四家，第七區甲種五八家，乙種五九家，總共甲乙兩種一一〇九家</p>
<p>當時參加公售糖額計四九七·五四六件，計開粗砂組三三七·〇四四件，車白組四三·五一八件，赤砂組八三·九四八件，生砂組九·九〇件靑糖組一九一三三件冰糖組四·〇〇〇件由合作處購進之糖計，二三·七六二件，並按月視市面需要予以配給與甲乙種各零售商至去年七月底爲止，合作處存糖爲二六九·三四五件，旋由軍配當局訂購鉅額，台灣分批運滬並向菲購買食糖收買香港存糖，所以滬市存糖總額當在三〇〇·〇〇〇件以上同時鍳於綿白冰糖及靑糖等爲華人必需之糖品，原係由爪哇香港閩廣及其他各處運滬銷售，現以存貨缺乏來源不繼，爲調節民食起見，故以組砂生砂冬霧靑碗靑等各原料糖，按其需要情形發交振記建華，大成，大華，義和，新華，和記，金心，等廠改製以便配給與各甲種零售商依照規定辦理發售。</p>
<p>關於實施配給食糖與甲乙種零售商辦法，規定零售商每月所需各種之食糖應自行精確預算逐月塡具申購書，向該處申請，經審核批准後，發給購買證，始得向糖行購買之，每月二十三日至二十五日三天內爲零售商申購期，每月五日至二十日爲糖行售與零售商之食糖交貨日期，零售商應以現金繳納保證金，至於甲種零售商門售辦法，初由食戶自由購買每人每次限制購買額，旋由有轉販牟利之徒，以及軋糖黨之非法活動，以致維持秩序頗感爲難，乃經合作處設法一再改善，最後決定慿房票發售，實行之後，排隊軋糖情事雖已銷滅，惟一般三房客與二房東派糖之糾葛難免，所以經軍配當局核准實行計口授糖新制，決定公共租界（包括虹口）以及法租界委託租界當局發給購糖證，至於配給食糖訂立售價等事宜，歸合作處負責辦理，至於南市閘北滬西等處計口授糖，則由合作處自行辦理，對於全市甲種零售商予以重行登記合併，以便集中售糖。</p>
<p>計口授糖實施日期數量價格，三中要問題，經糖業合作處與軍配當局，日大本使館上海事務所曁公共租界工部局法租界公董局，上海市政府等有關各方協商之後，（一）實施日期准三月份起實行，首次領購食糖日期三月十一日起發給，（二）計口授糖數量，視按月軍配當局核准，總額及需要而定，聞三月份數量華人爲八兩，（三）食糖價格業經核准由合作處重行訂定公佈。聞計口授糖實施之後，食糖黑市勢必自然消滅，此實爲市民之幸福也。</p>
<h3>集中金融復興農村經濟之　華興商業銀行</h3>
<p>華興商業儲蓄銀行，於前日（二十六日）舉行第四屆股東常會。出席者有全體股東及董事長梁鴻志，副董事長鷲尾及理監事等。所有提案經審議之結果，均照原案通過。該行創始於民國二十八年五月一日，資金五千萬圓，成立迄今，業務異常發達，平日業務注電於調劑金融，開發產業。去歲六月舊幣禁止流通後，該行協力擴大中儲券之流通。維持中儲券之價値，努力收買物資，放款復興農村，成續斐然。即以存放兩項而言，亦均有長足進步。本年度之棄務內容，注重於擴大流通團內金融及中儲券，其分行與辦事處，現有十一處，並擬在漢口，九江，安慶，常熟，常州，厦門，寗波等地添設分行與辦事　，更預定以五百萬元貸與各地合作社，取利極低，籍符該行復興農村經濟之本旨。茲將該行董事長梁鴻志氏向股東會提出之營業報吿全文錄后，以供我國經濟界之參考。</p>
<p>諸位股東，値茲第四屆股來常會，得將過去一年間華中經濟建設之往跡，曁去年中本行業務之槪　况，有所報吿，不勝欣幸。</p>
<p>民國三十一年之華中經濟狀况，一言以蔽之曰多事多難而已。丁茲大東亞戰爭勃發之非常事熊中，在中日當局密切連絡之下，所實施之各種政策，頗足以表現大東亞戰爭第一年之性格，而其印象亦最深刻。曰，英美在華資產之處理，曰，以儲備券爲通貨之枕一，曰，物價統制之實行，曰配給機構之調整，無不爲劃時代之工作。日月嬗遞，漸次已由緊急措置，轉變而爲永久實施。當戰事之興，即經日軍當局施行敵產管理，及物資處理，其概况當早在洞鑒之中，更無待贅述。茲從建設方面觀察，回顧一年來通貨，金融，物價各部門之推移，扼要申述如次。</p>
<p>先就通貨之統一而言，舊法幣之收回，與夫以儲備券爲統一通貨之推進，乃爲中國幣制史上所應大書特書之事業，其問經緯，容常後述，請先簡單說明通貨統一時期前後，舊法幣暴跌之經過。去年二月十五日，新加坡被佔，實予各方莫大之衝動，及至日軍進駐緬甸，所謂援蔣之緬甸公路，亦已完全遮斷。因之足以爲弱化渝方絕大因素之舊法幣不安，乃益漸深刻，一時人心浮動，羣起易物，金融市塲致呈半恐慌狀態，一般物價亦日趨上游。國民政府鑒於舊法幣之暴跌，圖在可能範圍內，减輕民衆所蒙受之損害，故於三月三十一日，國府還都紀念日，聲明新舊法幣脫離等價關係。此項措施，前已早加硏討，良以尙未充分準備完竣，不得不有所遲延。過大東亞戰爭序幕開啟時，尤其在緬甸公路遮斷後，對於舊法幣之前途，實有不堪設想者在，乃於新舊法幣脫離等價之先，三月九日宣布公定軍票對儲備券之行市，以期安定儲備券價値，是月月底，乃正式聲明脫離等價。彼時新舊法幣兌換行市，最初定爲舊法幣百元，對儲備券七十七元，但舊法幣不安之趨勢，縱有規定仍屬無所底止，至五月間，竟呈表面化，是月十九日以降愈形暴落，中央儲備銀行乃自二十日之七十四元開始改訂兌換率，繼之以二十一日之七十一元，二十日之六十六元，二十三日之六十元，二十五日之五十三元，遂日次第改低，以滴應市塲之實際情勢，直至二十六日，遂降爲五十元，甚且更有再低之虞，不期而遂產生此舊法幣二元，對新法幣一元之兌換比率。</p>
<p>當時爲謀華中民生之安定，中日當局遂斷然以禁止舊法幣流通爲前提，實施全面交換。五月二十七日財政部得聲明蘇浙皖一省，京滬兩而，按舊法幣二元，對儲備券一元之比率，實施全面交換，並明示方針，一俟收回竣事後，剝奪舊法幣之法的通貨性，不許其正式流通。至其具體之措置，乃於六月一日分別頒布「整理舊法幣條例「整理貨幣暫行辦法之適用辦法」「民國三十一年金融安定公債條例」及民國三十一年金融安定公債特種會計辦法」等四項法令，預定自六月八日起，於兩星期內開始收回舊法幣，惟經參酌各地情形，京滬等十一都市，延展三天，其他淸鄉地區各都市，亦有繼續交換至是月月底者，結果獲得意外之成績，而完畢其全面交換事宜。</p>
<p>七月以後，回收地域，更由華中擴展至華南，七月十日於廣東，厦門，八月十日於武漢地區，採取同樣措置，一方面國民政府之通貨統一，着着前進，與車慶方面之通貨戰，更臻發展。儲備券流通範圍之擴大，同時發行數額之增加，益爲顯著，爲企圖充實發行準備起見，特經日本政府援助，於七月二十八日中央儲備銀行與日本銀行，簽訂一萬萬元借款契約，以是儲備銀行，愈益堅實，而倍臻發展。</p>
<p>舊法幣開始收回以來，瞬經半年有餘，其間儲備　流通區域，已擴大至上述廣泛之地帶，同時自六月二十五日起，南京上海兩市，開始禁止使用舊法幣，江蘇省淸鄕地區，杭州，嘉興，鎮江及太湖東南第一期淸鄕地區，亦依次斷然禁止使用與携帶，更於廣東省厦門市暨武漢地區，亦爲同樣措置，惟蘇浙皖三省，因有特殊情形，未能全面的禁止流通，乃自十二月一日，該三省及京滬兩市，不僅絕對禁止舊法幣使用與携帶，更不得保存及持有，因之特於十一月一日起，至三十日止，復在該地區內，施行嚴後交換。至是華中通貨統一可云達到最後階段，舊法幣已喪失其所謂通貨之機能，而儲備券之一色化，於以實現。</p>
<p>與通貨統一之努力，相輔而行者，厥爲國民政府之金融統制，一年間獲有異常之進展。在大東亞戰爭勃發以前，滙豐銀行以次之英美系銀行團，本地金融界絕對的受其支配，同時在其庇護下之重慶政府系銀行，亦擁有相常勢力，因之中央儲備銀行，對於金融界之支配力，未克即時仲長。顧此次戰爭之興，英美系曁重慶系之銀行，即經日軍當局予以押收，是以中央儲備銀行，乃爲華中唯一之發券銀行，而於金融界之支配力，亦迅加進展。國民政府於八月二十一日公布「金融機關管理暫行辦法」又於九月十八日頒行該項施行細則，規定銀行錢莊等金融機關設立許可制度，使要求提出營業報吿書之權限，趨於合法化，並令一般華商銀行，提繳存款支付準備金，存入中央儲備銀行。中央儲備銀行金融統制力，乃益强大。而於實質上，已保有中央銀行之資格。另一方面，日本當局所押收之重慶系四銀行中，中國交通兩行，自九月一日以後，一掃重慶系之色彩，在儲備銀行旗幟下但業，獲得各方非常好感。又華商銀行之金融調節機關之聯合準備委員會，亦適應現勢，改組內部，表示對國民政府以協力之姿態，從事調整，此外上海外商銀行公會，亦繼起排除英美色彩，以日方銀行爲中心，而重新出發。</p>
<p>其次關於物價統制之實施，五月二十九日公布「安定物價臨時辦法」與前項通貨統一政策相俟而行，漸趨積極，嗣後於七月三日分別公布「平定物價暫行條例」及「取締私抬物價暫行條例」從來物價政策上之癥結，亦即利用金融機關之投機行爲，得以完全根除·中日關係當局，自九月一日起，在密切聯絡下，進行綜合的物價對策，先從一般零售物價着手，以五月底之價格爲標準，禁止不得逾限。此種零售物價之限制，自屬臨時應急措置，故關係方面，爲求根本對策計，舉凡原料收買，乃至製品配給之一貫的價格統制，蒐買配給機構之確立，以及需要之調整等，亦莫不在充分考慮之中，自不待言。惟因物資不足之故，以致囤貨居奇之風，依然未戢，十月中旬以後，食糖，油等主要食品，及棉紗棉布類騰貴之趨勢，實有未可漠視者。十一月十九日當局制定關於華中最大之工業製品，即棉紗棉市之批發最高價格，自十二月一日起實施。向來物價統制，只此於消費一部份，此次兼及於批發部份，可認為含有重大之意義，更可以示今後物價統制之趨向也。</p>
<p>總而言之，自大東亞戰爭勃發。至佔領新加坡，戡定緬甸止，此時期爲對於華中經濟上迅速實施各種應急對策之時期。今若假定此爲第一期，則新舊法幣脫離後，至上年十一月底之第二期，亦即爲收回舊法幣，及各方面建設計劃實行之時期。十二月以後之第三期以蘇浙皖三省全面禁止舊法幣爲始，在主席訪日以還，可知已由同甘共苦，一躍而入同生共死之送矣。大體在上述環境之下，本行去年中之業務狀况，漸臻於堅實之發展，新舊法幣之脫離，繼之以全面交換，儲備券進爲統一通貨，在此極歷史的激變期中，本行存放款之增加，不因此而有所阻碍。比諸上年同時之業况，有過之無不及，誠堪同慶而吿慰者也。今閱各項存放款之期末餘額，計存款在六月底爲二七〇，一九一千元，十二月底三二〇，五五二千元，放款六月底二〇二，三二二千元，十二月底二六一，四六三千元。而純益上半期爲一，四〇〇千元，下半期爲一，八三五千元，合計三，二三五千元，前年度純益爲三，二五九千元（舊法幣本位），以之視爲儲備券本位，雖似覺稍有减色，然此實綠於國外匯兌停頓之故，而仍能有上述之成績，此可資證明存放款之增加也。本行前自外幣資金凍結令實施以來，即以國內金融爲業務重心，而從事增設內地行處，實行已吿一段落，去年中新設南通，嘉興，揚州等辦事處，本年一月總行移至共榮大樓（前有利銀行址），復於舊址，設立虹口支行，現除總行外，分支行處共有十一處所。</p>
<p>又於去年一月，添設儲蓄信託兩部，主要目的爲作銀行部之資金供給部門，而爲側面的努力，並經營代理保險，代客保管，經銷債券，管理不動產，暨各種放款等業務，以特殊之立塲，達到相當之成績。</p>
<p>前次友邦日本，新設大東亞省，同時本行常務董事岡崎嘉平太氏，因就任大東亞省參事官而去職，吾人於歡送之餘，深念該氏爲本行創立以來，勞續卓著，且爲本行不可或缺之人，祇以日本當局之切望，不得已而步入宦途，此事於上次股東臨時會時，曾經率吿，惟至今猶不勝依依也。</p>
<p>最後所欲言者，乃國民政府已於一月九日宣布參戰，由於今次之參戰，而使中日兩國關係，巳自同甘共苦，進而至於同生共死，要知大東亞戰爭，非僅日本對英美之戰爭，實係全東亞被壓迫民族蹶起之行動。値茲新事態，此後經濟政策上，勢將展開新序幕，此又可逆睹者也。</p>
<p>中國於建設途上，其資材向由日本輸入者甚夥，今後自不能專賴於日本，而須致力於自給自足。進一步言，中國應以所有之資源及生產，爲對英美作戰而動員，於友邦緊密提携之下，向完成戰爭之途而邁進，故擴充生產力，實爲第一要策，苟念及目下南方水域所展開之一大消耗戰時，則中日兩國全面的協力，其需要程度，實未有如今日之急切者，吾人堅信現正爲兩國相携，力圖擊滅英美之秋也。華興商菜銀行董事長梁鴻（志民國三十二年二月二十六日。）</p>

<h3>樂業</h3>
<p>— 費惠</p>
<p>在這時代，失業的人是日日在加增着，雖然其原因是多方面的，因爲社會的蕭條，或者因爲人事的變遜，於是大批的人就接着失業了，然而還有一個重要的原因，那就是一般就業的人往往不能樂業。不管甚麽人做甚麽事，假如他對這方面並沒有與趣，那末這件事怎會成功呢？因此一個就業的工作人員，假若整天的怨天尤人，這樣他的工作效率就會相對的降低，而給與別人的印象也就惡劣了。這就是不能樂業。</p>
<p>實在，不論何種職業，當細細體味一下以後，都是含着很大的樂趣的。眞正的樂趣郤常埋在困難的中心，待辛苦地發掘了，最後是一定可以獲得牠的。因此就業的人應以樂業作基礎，以忍耐的苦功去戰勝一般惡劣的環境。</p>
<p>不過，目前一個以低廉薪水爲生的職工，的確太難使他維持生活了。如此，也會使他感到所做的事業無聊。這是需要互相諒解的，僱主方面也應盡可能的减輕職工們的痛苦，以免使他們有「吃一行怨一行」的心理，而减低了工作效率。</p>
<h3>苦悶期待與努力</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>有許多人覺得生活苦悶，他們殷切的期待着光明的來臨，可是光明不是從想像中得來的，它是要從努力中才能得到。所以沒有苦悶是沒有期待的因此苦悶是期待的動機，而期待呢？更諸要有努力，方才使苦悶有出路。</p>
<p>有許多人這樣說：「期待不是苦悶的出路，它只是苦悶時的一種現象而已！」這句話我以爲很對，如果期待中不努力，期待了有什麽用呢？所以我們決不能抱着「靠天吃飯」的口號，我們也不能相信命運的支配。我們應該記住「英雄造時勢」的一句老話，在苦悶中祇靠期待和希望是沒有用的，更要緊的就是努力。</p>
<p>我們讀過偉大的傳記，似乎覺得他們由苦悶期待和努力中得到成功，推究成功的原因是起源於「少有大志」。其實「大志」並不可貴，可貴者就是個人的努力。一般人的失敗，就是有了苦悶和期待，而沒有努力。所以一般人都是雄心勃勃，自己生活反頹唐消沉，雖然有期待，也不過是一塲春夢而已。</p>
<p>朋友們！我們不要痴想希望會到來的，我們應該背起重担朝前走，雖然是苦悶，可是期待中的佳境，沒有努力能達到嗎？所以必須要努力而後才有成功。我們不要單說苦悶，我們也不要只是期待，我們必須要努力準備，我們要「背起重組」，這才是苦悶的出路呢！</p>
<h3>藤與章</h3>
<p>— 周序尙</p>
<p>石子舖成的院子裏，長滿了雜亂的靑草。爲了要使整潔美觀，費了整的一日，才把它們完全肅淸。那時雖然精疲力竭，然而完成了一件心願，倒也欣然自得，可是過不數日，它們又在石縫內探頭探腦了，一氣之下，再拿了小刀鐵鏟，一株株將它們連土挖起，可是，數日後，它們仍又恢復了原狀。這樣經過幾次三番，終究無法阻壓住它們的生機。這時我方纔明白，人爲的力量，到底摧殘不了自然的生機正同惡勢力終究遏不住正義的怒潮一般，靑草的那種百折不挠的生長力，較諸那些非寄生不能自立的藤條之類，實勝過萬倍</p>
<p>把現在的人類，大略地區別起來，也可分為「草樣的人與「藤樣的人」二類，前一種人是靠着自己的奮圈，立足於社會。後一種人却是依賴着遺產或寄生在剝削投機上的，他們往往吃着嫖賭，逍遙於勞動綫外，不顧自己之所作所爲，是否有害於國家社會，但是浮沙上的高塔，遲早有傾坍的一天，在不久的將來，也許就有暴風雨來摧折了他們的寄生柱」，（却酬）</p>
<h3>看李硯秀紀玉良的戲</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>今年立奪以後，燈節以前，計時半月，演平戲的戲院，我沒有去過，我有我的道理，平劇一向的習償，在農歷元且起，每日夜演兩工戲，今年又添上一曆新興花樣，頭二牌的角兒，常常演變齣重頭戲，合着每人日夜唱。四齣戲，就是鐵打铜鑄的人，也要疲乏，何况都是肉身子？那得不累的要死？我們要聽戲，自然要聽聚精會神的好戲，這樣咬牙切齒的乏戲，看了也不感覺舒服，所以不必去看，再說新春中看戲的，另有一班人，扶老携幼，品類甚雜，內中知音的很少，比平日格外喧鬧，耳根不净</p>
<p>二月十九日，適爲癸未年元宵，這大甚怪，不見火樹銀花，但見大雪紛飛，我想今天是聽戲的時候了。於是冒着風駕擺駕皇后戲院，紀玉良和李硯秀，都是雙齣戲，紀的火牛陣，就是黄金台，這兩個戲名。都離題很遠，——我沒有看見，李硯秀的大劈棺，正演吊孝說親，舊四庚的「二百五，」小壽山的徒弟「春雲，」正在圖哏，兩個小花臉，都不錯，這一塲田氏看見楚王孫長的漂亮，問長間短，想嫁給他，兩人問答的話，都由「春雲」和「二百五」傳話，全歸兩個小花臉鬥笑，田氏和楚王孫並沒有什麽戲做，田氏的戲，在勞棺的時候，顯　她的做工和武技，李硯秀前年在更新舞台出演時，我看她滿臉滿身的肥肉，胖得嚇人，印象不佳，我就不大注意她的演戲怎樣了，今天看她扮的田氏，身子已然瘦了許多，臉上貼的「片子」得法，並不顯着怎樣肥大，我仔細端詳一下，看見她有一雙好眼，又長又大，眼睛珠烏黑，有時右眼瞇縫起來，做一個眼神，很有媚態，這是我前年不曾看到的，今天若不細看，就寃屈了她這雙好眼。下面「二百五」用扇子撲一對蝴蝶，曹四庚做的很好，頭部上身完全不動，像眞紙紮的人兒，這一塲是早先梆子班添的「小材料」——噱頭——和「戰宛城」中鄒氏趕兩個雌雄老鼠的作用一樣，都是無中生有，節外生枝，不過莊周化蝶，在古書上有這句話，所以道並不是畫蛇添足，但另有一個意思，看客須要知道，道一對飛舞的蝴蝶，象徵着人類男女的互戀，惟有脫離紅塵的莊周，躺在棺材板裏不能動彈，纔可以免去「人之大欲」的麻煩。李硯秀的田氏，劈棺之前的磨斧，很有交代，比近來一切演田氏的坤角强得多，及至上桌子劈開棺材，見莊周忽地復活站了起來，照例應擇一個筋斗，硯秀沒有摔，恐怕是偷懶吧，莊子這問他的時候，她在地上打滾，兩脚朝天紋勳，名日「雙龍絞柱，」道一手也是照例的玩意，不過在坤角玩這一套，又是穿着短衣，綁着假小脚，別人看到眼裏，有美而豔的感覺，誰也不會討厭的，這戲田氏用斧自刎完畢，下面紀玉良又來一齣斬黃袍，劉鴻聲從肖唱這戲最拿手，因爲調子高，嗓音圓，起幾個「嘎調」，像放高射砲，每一顆子彈，都打到摩天雲裏去，又響又脆，至於翻高腔，更是家常便飯，本地風光，絕不費力，自然入妙，所以他唱這路高調門的戲著名，紀玉良去年在黃金，嗓子總算不錯，今年我聽人脫，他的嗓子壞了，我有些不信，今天聽他唱斬黃袍，嗓子果然不濟了，調門不够「六半調」，根本就不是斬黄袍的調門，他唱的腔兒，顯然是對付着唱，「看端詳」詳字，照例使嘎調，玉良使是使　，高處不足，也不够寬長，「解袍帶一照劉派又是一個　調，玉良卻不會使，聽這齣斬黄袍，玉良始終是敷衍着唱，精彩毫無，嗓子空虛比在黃金時代，低一個調門，莫非出了毛病了嗎？若不趕快殺一條血路出來，我替他的前途担心啊！下面李硯秀又演一齣梁紅玉擂鼓戰金山，這是一齣武戲，硯秀扮韓世忠夫人梁氏，唱的是北曲，露的是「把子」「亮像，」也可以看看，但不能算最精的戲，不必細評了。</p>
<h3>生活的任務</h3>
<p>— 石漢</p>
<p>時間是人生公正的批評者，它是一支衡量人生意義的儀器，當你在人生的旅程上跑完一個段落的時候，它會拿它所耗去的長度來衡量你成就的多少，再來對你眞生命的意義下個公正無私的判斷，任你是個世界上著名的詭辯家，也設法在它的判斷下置上一喙，以岡飾辯。</p>
<p>生活的任務就是怎樣在時間的衡量下維持相等的價値，或竟致超過，說得明白些，就是人在每一個時期裏得完成或超過你應得的課目，才能在天秤上使你的生命意義與時間維持平衡，或使放着時間的一面高翹起來！</p>
<h3>聯想。幻想。理想</h3>
<p>— 仲舜</p>
<p>依據心理學的解釋，聯想是連串的思潮。當我們經騐從前經騐過的事情，常能帶出與那經騐相關的另一事情來。正如查斯特羅所說「腦筋會成一個破船或是雜貨拍賣攤子。」遂漸陳列出來。所以聯想實在是一串過去經騐順次的再現。</p>
<p>幻想就不同了。它和聯想最大的區別，是一種希冀着未來的心理。所謂「胡思亂想」，「想入非非」均屬之，通常也叫做作夢想。這幻想，在思想出發的過程，一無憑藉，只是一種妄想的自我心理滿足，結果失敗」會佔據了他的一生</p>
<p>至於理想，他的思想是有所依據，循序而進，按同因而生同果的規律，達到目的的「蓋然性」很大，若使沒有所謂「偶然的」事情的阻攔，經過一番努力，也許可以如願以償。所以他的念頭決不是過去經騐的重復出現，也絕非像幻想的無所依據，層次混淆。因此這種念頭，可名為理想。就是所謂「烏托邦」如孔子的「大同」</p>
<p>至於聯想幻想和理想的關係。是三者各為思想的一部分。而這裏聯想的範圍，是涉及過去，側重過去；幻想和理想，均著眼於未來。用人來說，聯想是近於一個熟悉掌故的老人，幻想好像富有情感的靑年，而理想呢，也是靑年，但他是挾有理性的。</p>

<p>他喜歡有人對他提出這個好意見。他覺得那樣的軟弱，以致他來不及再去猜想事情的經過—他們怎樣送他上樓，威葛特夫人說些什麽，以及其他的事情。可是，突然，在牀的那邊他看見了威葛特夫人。她在微笑着。他想：啊唷，天曉得，她在那裏幹些什麼呢？在牟里阜兩背後的影子裏，他又看見了卡特萊特（Crtwright），那位新校長（雖然他自一九一九年起就來到勃洛克菲爾德了，他想他還是「新的」），和大家稱之爲『羅迪』（Roddy）的老勃夫爾斯。希奇，他們都在這裏。他覺得：不論怎樣，我用不着找麻煩去想這樣想那樣。我要睡着了。</p>
<p>不過這不是睡眠，但這也不是十分的淸醒：這是一種中間狀態，充滿着夢，面孔，和聲音。老的景象與老的零碎音調：加娣曾參加表演的莫扎特的三人合奏曲—歡呼，大笑，和砲聲—在在這些聲音之上，勃洛克菲爾德的鐘聲，勃洛克菲爾德的鐘聲。「因此你們看，如果普勒布斯女士要柏特里西安先生娶她，囑，不對的，你能够，你這說謊的人。…」笑話：討厭的肉…笑話…你麽，馬克斯？是的，進來。祖國有甚麼消息？…O　Miki　Praeteritos…拉爾斯頓說我遲鈍而沒有效能—但是他們沒有了我就幹不下去。…Obile　herec　ago　fotibus　es　in　aro…你們裏面誰能够繙譯出來麼？…這是一個笑話。…</p>

<h3>推廣集團結婚</h3>

<p>婚姻爲親屬關係之源泉，且爲社會組織之成因。我國昔時對於婚姻之形式，素極電視，其儀文禮節，尤爲繁褥，若周之納采，問名，納吉，請期，納徵，觀迎等六禮。降及後世，儀文漸趨籣易，至朱子家禮，則僅存納采，納徵，親迎三禮。及至近世，習俗相沿，仍未脫舊時形態。但在此世事動盪民生困苦之今日，舖張糜費，實大可不必，若由個別結婚改爲集團結婚，則在經濟上大可節省，譬如禮堂，原需各別借用，耗費甚大，合作擊行，則可採公共禮堂制，嬪相亦可採聯合制，樂隊及一切設備，均可合用，故集團結婚不論在任何方面，均較單獨進行爲省，尤其許多新人聚首一堂，喜氣洋洋，精神上自然格外愉快。例如日前大來集團結婚服務社假座仙樂舞宮舉行集團結婚典禮，由陳已生先生證婚，秩序井然，儀式簡單而隆重，黃警頑先生送賀聯：「賢伉儷須從相敬相愛做去，好家庭必由克勤克儉得來，」尤爲凑趣。際此物力維艱之秋，此種制度實頗可推廣。查結婚祇須不違背現行民法親屬編規定「結婚應有公開之儀式及二人以上之證人」之要件，即爲合法。甚望今後社會靑年男女於擇偶時必須審慎，而在結婚形式上務求其簡便，集團結婚乃合乎節約，大方，合法之結婚制度，宜乎値得提倡也。</p>

<h3>Promoting Wartime Public Education: Hopes for the National Education Conference (4)</h3>
<p>Public education, or popular education, is a powerful tool for mobilizing the strength of the people to implement government policy. First and foremost, it is literacy education. We have long advocated for the elimination of illiteracy, and the most effective way to achieve this is through the widespread promotion of literacy education. Because if illiteracy is not eradicated, the people's wisdom will not be opened, the country will have no way to turn from weak to strong, and the nation will have no way to recover. We must, through universal public literacy education, utilize students at all levels of schools and existing intellectuals in society to work together to eliminate illiteracy. For example, stipulating that students at all levels must teach a certain number of people to read as a component of their semester performance evaluation, so that we can eradicate illiteracy throughout the country in a short period.</p>
<p>Secondly, public education should universally develop supplementary education. On the one hand, it provides necessary supplementary knowledge to those who have received national education but feel it is insufficient; on the other hand, it addresses the shortcomings of past school education and provides the knowledge necessary for new-era citizens. This kind of supplementary education, in all subjects, must fully adapt to the international situation, national policies, and social needs. At the same time, it should impart essential wartime knowledge and skills, especially basic political common sense, to enhance the people's organizational strength and give them the ability to self-govern and be self-aware.</p>
<p>The third key point of public education is to pay special attention to the literacy education, supplementary education, and technical education of adult men and women. On the one hand, it enables them to become literate, understand the righteousness of life, and the responsibilities they should bear to the country and society; on the other hand, it enables them to skillfully apply what they have learned to improve their actual lives. Therefore, the content of literacy textbooks should not be the same as that taught in ordinary primary schools, but should be in line with social life and current affairs, so that they can learn to read and write in a short period, and also acquire life skills, so that they can become a part of wartime production or post-war reconstruction.</p>
<p>To meet these requirements, public education must be: (1) Mass-oriented: all out-of-school adult men and women, or those who are undereducated but aspire to further their studies, should be welcomed to enroll without restriction. (2) Socialized: that is, the meaning of "education is life, the universe is the school." On the one hand, cultivate students' group life, so that what they learn is closely related to their life; on the other hand, guide them to unite and help each other, improve their actual lives, and participate in social undertakings and patriotic movements. (3) Popularized: that is, all textbooks and class organizations should be designed to attract out-of-school people to study and obtain practical benefits. What they learn should be understandable, digestible, and applicable; otherwise, even if they know many characters, they will know nothing about the affairs, and the original meaning of public education will be lost. (4) Universalized: that is, it should not only be promoted in cities, but more importantly, it should be developed in rural areas, to eliminate illiteracy and improve the general cultural level. (5) Most importantly, the central goal of all methods should not be simply to consider the completion of a few public schools as the end of the matter. On the one hand, we must use vernacular newspapers, picture newspapers, wall newspapers, simple books and periodicals, improved storytelling, broadcasting, public speeches, street and door-to-door propaganda, etc., to complement public schools and improve the cultural level of the people. On the other hand, we must take reforming bad social customs and promoting production as an important mission.</p>
<p>How to promote the above-mentioned public education? In terms of implementation agencies, the first is naturally to universally improve and add public schools, various tutoring classes, etc. The curriculum can be determined according to the environment, students' level, and actual needs. Teachers can utilize civil servants at all levels, students, and enthusiastic intellectuals in society. The second is to establish public education centers, which can generally be divided into lectures, exhibitions, libraries, and attached public schools, public tea gardens, and public clinics, craft training classes, etc., paying special attention to helping the public solve practical problems. However, in the past, public education centers only worked within the centers. In the future, public education should be deeply rooted in the people, truly living up to its name. Other facilities such as public libraries, public gymnasiums, public reading rooms, public amusement parks, and mobile book and newspaper teams can be determined according to local conditions and actual needs. In addition, we want to especially mention that public education has often been restricted by the political environment in the past. We believe that a wise government should provide a favorable political environment for the development of public education, concentrate people with aspirations from all walks of life, allocate sufficient funding, and promote public education in a planned and organized manner. On the one hand, it should ensure that those who run public education are not affected by political personnel changes; on the other hand, it should also cut off the opportunity for educators to enter politics. In the social sphere, we should help the government with effort and money, and universally develop public education under the guidance of the government. It is obvious that things like libraries, museums, botanical and zoological gardens, public theaters, public sports fields, and various supplementary education, etc., are impossible to rely on the government's strength alone, especially in the current wartime state. The government should quickly formulate measures to encourage people with aspirations from the private sector to contribute efforts and funds to promote public education, so that all parties can work together to eliminate illiteracy throughout the country and improve the cultural level of the people, so as to concentrate public strength during the war and realize "total war participation." We also hope to develop the people's strength after the war and complete the construction of a new China. We hope that this National Education Conference will encourage this.</p>
<h3>National Education Administration Conference Holds Second General Assembly Yesterday, First Group of Proposals Has Been Discussed, Ambassador Shigemitsu Hosts Attending Members</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Third National Education Administration Conference held its second plenary session of members yesterday (27th) at 9:00 a.m. The meeting was chaired by Minister Li, the Speaker, and Superintendant Su, the Vice-Speaker. After the meeting began, the Speaker respectfully read the will of the Founding Father of the Republic. Next, the Secretary-General reported on (1) the attendees, including Zhao Zhengping, Zhou Yueran, Fan Zhongyun, Zhang Tingjin, and Li Shiheng, totaling 99 people; and (2) the reading of the minutes of the first plenary session. After receiving congratulatory telegrams from the Chinese Society of Japanese Returnees and the Chinese Women's Thrift and Frugality Society, the conveners of each proposal review committee reported separately: (1) The Education Administration and Funding Group, Group 1, reported by convener Qian Daosun, reviewed a total of 86 submitted cases, with 17 transferred from Group 3, totaling 103 cases. The result was that similar cases were combined into 41 categories. (2) The Higher Education Group, Group 2, reported by convener Li Taifen, reviewed 28 submitted cases, combined into 12 categories. (3) The General Education Group, Group 3, reported by convener Li Shiheng, reviewed 76 submitted cases, with 17 transferred to Group 1 for review. The rest were combined into 17 categories. (4) The Social Education Group, Group 4, reported by convener Pei Fuheng, reviewed 18 submitted cases, combined into 18 categories. (5) The Other Group, Group 5, reported by convener Zhang Tingjin, reviewed 36 submitted cases, divided into 3 categories. After the reports were completed, detailed review reports from each group were distributed to each member, and discussions began immediately on the proposals from Group 1. (1) Regarding the reform of the education system and curriculum standards, Wang Luxun, Qian Weizong, Zhao Zhengping, Xu Jidun, Guo Ruizhang, Xu Liangqiu, Vice-Speaker Su, and others successively expressed their opinions, which were all very concise. They all believed that the education system was related to the overall education plan, and each change had taken many years to finalize, so it should not be changed lightly. Even if preparations were made for changes, they should be prudent and thorough. It was proposed that the Ministry of Education should hire famous scholars to organize an education system research committee and a curriculum standards research committee to work in conjunction. (2) Regarding funding and improving salaries, Dai Yingfu, He Qingyuan, Fan Zhongyun, Zhao Zhengping, Xu Liangqiu, Xu Chao Yuan Xu, Ji Dun, and others successively expressed their opinions. Regarding increasing education funding, it was resolved that: 1. The central government and all provinces, cities, and counties should increase education funding. 2. The increased amount should be specified as a percentage within the overall budget. 3. The central government should establish a unified plan for the education funding of each province, city, and county to avoid uneven surpluses and deficits. 4. The food for those engaged in education should be distributed at a low price and preferentially if the government adopts a rationing system. All other cases in Group 1 were passed according to the review opinions. The meeting was adjourned at 12:00 noon. At 12:30 p.m., all members attended a reception hosted by Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu. At 3:00 p.m., 15 representatives of the general assembly, including Chuan Yuefen, accompanied by the Speaker and Vice-Speaker, went to the official residence to pay their respects to the chairman. It is reported that the third plenary session will be held at 9:00 a.m. this morning. The proposals in this conference are most numerous in Group 1, accounting for more than half of all proposals.

<h3>Japanese Army in Hubei Achieves Victory, Yu Wang Jinzai Captured, Nanyu Stronghold in Mianyang Occupied, Japanese Army Also Achieves Victory in Shandong and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Hubei Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched an annihilation war against the Yu army under Wang Jinzai in Hubei, they have achieved great success. On the 24th, Wang Jinzai, seeing that the general situation was over, escaped from his base of Baiziqiao under the protection of more than 2,000 of his subordinates. At midnight, he tried to escape alone to Liujiaji from Fengkou. The Japanese army detected this and captured him on the levee near Gongjiawan (2 kilometers northeast of Liujiaji) at 7:30 p.m. on the 25th.</p>
<p>Hubei Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Yu army under Wang Jinzai in southern Hubei had built solid positions in the area, boasting that they could be defended for a long time. However, after the Japanese army's fierce attack since the 21st, they had been completely defeated by the 25th. The Japanese army's results as of the 25th are as follows: 3,900 corpses of Yu soldiers were abandoned, 7,500 were captured, and the Japanese army captured a total of 70 light and heavy machine guns, 40 mortars, and a large number of other military supplies.</p>
<p>Hubei Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - A certain unit of the Japanese army has been advancing from east to west on the front line in Hubei for several days. After occupying Nanjiadaqiao at 3:00 a.m. on the 25th, they swept away the defeated Yu army everywhere, and launched a fierce night attack on the Yu army's last major stronghold 15 kilometers southeast of Mianyang, launching a heroic bayonet battle. By about 7:00 a.m., they had completely occupied the area.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - On the 23rd, the Japanese army annihilated the 183rd division of the Yu army on the high ground in the direction of Cunqianjie and crushed its tight defensive positions. On the 24th, they turned their attack on the newly formed 12th division of the Yu army. At 10:00 a.m. on the same day, the Japanese army crossed the Jinjiang River near Gaoan and annihilated the Yu army in that area at about 10:00 a.m. on the 26th, and annihilated the 36th regiment of the Yu army that was reinforcing near Maanshan. On the other hand, the Japanese army also launched a fierce attack on Macheng at the same time and completely occupied the area. The strategic gains of this battle are as follows: 360 Yu army corpses were abandoned, 90 were captured, 3 mortars and 320 rifles were captured.</p>
<p>Western Shandong Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Shandong, with the remnants of the 2nd regiment of the 22nd brigade of the Shandong Security under Liu Huachuan, the head of the regiment and the magistrate of Xiazhen, entrenched in the area between Linqing, Tangyi, Qingping, and Xiazhen on the border of Hebei Province, and plotted to stir up trouble. On the morning of the 22nd, at 7:40 a.m., they launched a surprise attack on Dazhangguanying, 10 kilometers southwest of Qingping County, and launched a fierce attack with a small number of troops on the Yu army. A bayonet battle was launched immediately. After five hours of fierce fighting, the Yu army commander Liu Huachuan and other cadres and soldiers were killed, 98 Yu army soldiers were captured, and 134 rifles and countless other military supplies were captured.</p>
<h3>Member of the Japanese Information Department Talks About the Su-Huai Battle</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - The battle in the northern Jiangsu plain, which began on the 13th of this month, has fully demonstrated the results of the joint operations of the Chinese and Japanese armies. In a short period of time, the Yu army's strongholds have been successively occupied, and the courageous campaign of suppression is still continuing. Ohno, a member of the information department of the Japanese General Army, served as a campaign instructor in this battle and recently returned to base. According to what he said about the truth of the battle, the general idea is that I have served in the Chinese war zone for three years, but I have never seen such good conditions as in this battle. The connection between the Yu army's 89th army and the New Fourth Army and Chongqing has been completely cut off. The surrounding areas are all peaceful areas, and the people there have also understood the reality of the peaceful areas. Therefore, throughout the battle, they have always cooperated with the Chinese and Japanese armies. This is also enough to prove that the Yu army's 89th army and the New Fourth Army's work among the people has been too harsh, so they have lost the trust of the people. The area near the battlefield is almost all rivers and swamps, which has caused considerable inconvenience to the advance. However, the residents there are happy to serve as guides, and thanks to this, the advance has been smooth, regardless of water or road. Some have bravely captured defeated soldiers. All this makes it easy to imagine the deep suffering that the local people have suffered from the oppression of the Yu communist army in the past. After the battle in that area is over, the residents quickly organize self-government associations and cultural associations to cooperate in promoting post-war reconstruction. It is also worth mentioning that a certain army of the National Government participated in the battle and was exceptionally active. According to reports, this army was established in the 29th year of the Republic of China and has repeatedly fought with the 129th Division of the Yu army in the Hankou area. This army is worthy of praise in terms of both its military appearance and morale. Moreover, all the officers and soldiers of this unit know that they are an army of the people, so they have gained the trust of the people, which is also the biggest reason why they can get the cooperation of the residents.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Burma Launches New Military Action to Prevent Chongqing from Moving Yunnan Troops</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 27th (Allied News Agency) - A spokesman for the Japanese Expeditionary Force in Burma announced that the Japanese Army in Burma has launched a new military action to prevent the Yu army from moving troops in Yunnan and to disrupt air transport between India and Kunming. The Japanese Air Force has been in the eastern part of India for the latter half of February. The British army hopes to retake Burma and has continued to attack Japanese creeks since December of last year, but each time it has been repelled by the Japanese army and suffered great losses.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army Air Force continued to attack the Tinsukia Airport in eastern India on the 25th with large formations of fighters and bombers, destroying eight large aircraft parked on the field. Together with the 15 aircraft destroyed on the 23rd, the total is 23 aircraft. Five enemy fighters were shot down in air combat. Since Chongqing lost the Burma Road, the import of supplies has been decreasing, so the United States has changed to transporting supplies with large transport aircraft. The Tinsukia Airport is the main route from Calcutta to Burma, with about 12 or 13 transport aircraft flying between the two places every day. This time, the enemy's transport aircraft were destroyed in a surprise bombing by the Japanese Air Force, most of which were Douglas (DC-3) type sports aircraft. In addition, three Japanese aircraft did not return to their original defense in this battle.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Gandhi's three-week fast will end on March 3rd. Gandhi's health is gradually recovering. His condition was good yesterday and he had a brief meeting with the former Premier of Madras Province.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Allied News Agency) - According to Reuters from Bombay, former Governor of Madras, Mr. Gopala Chari, visited Gandhi last night for a brief conversation. It is said that Gandhi was quite happy and confident that he could survive this fasting period.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Allied News Agency) - According to a report from Bombay today, the Bombay government issued a public statement stating that Gandhi's physical condition on the 17th day of his fast showed slight changes, his attitude was indifferent and unhappy.</p>
<p>Indians Strike in Sympathy with Gandhi</p>
<p>Bangkok, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The Menggong Textile Industry Association issued an order to textile workers in the area and Ahmedabad to begin a general strike immediately until Gandhi's fasting period ends.

<p>Two Major British Crimes Against India</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Since Britain's rule over India, what is forever resented and hard to forget by Indians are the most brutal Rowlatt Act and the most cruel Amritsar Massacre. The so-called Rowlatt Act was when Britain broke its promise of post-war autonomy for India, which it had allowed during the last World War, and stipulated in the law that British military police and officials could punish Indians without legal proceedings in order to control British resistance. The Indians sacrificed a great deal for the British during the Great War, but the British broke their word and repaid kindness with evil, which caused a nationwide anti-British upsurge. Gandhi stipulated that the first Sunday after the implementation of the Act would be a day of sorrow for the Indians. All Indians would stop all business on this day, fast to express their pain, and hold a general assembly against the Rowlatt Act. On April 12, 1919, when Indians held a meeting against the Rowlatt Act in Jallianwala Bagh Park in Amritsar, the British military commander of the area, Dyer, believed that they were violating his order prohibiting gatherings of more than four people, so he led British troops to surround more than 20,000 Indians participating in the meeting and ordered machine guns to fire indiscriminately for ten minutes until the ammunition ran out. At that time, more than 2,000 Indians were brutally slaughtered, which was extremely cruel. This is the historical fact of the so-called Amritsar Massacre. The British were so brutal that the Indians' resentment towards Britain increased day by day.</p>
<p>Japan Holds Rally to Aid India</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japan Relief for Indian Nationals Rally, jointly sponsored by the Great Political Association, the Greater Japan Asian League, and the Asahi, Mainichi, and Yomiuri newspapers, was held at the Kabuki-za here this afternoon at 1 p.m. Mr. Mizuno of the Asia League served as chairman, and the ceremony was held as scheduled. First, the chairman read out the declaration and resolutions, which were unanimously approved by the entire assembly. Then, speeches were given. First, Mr. Okiharu, Vice-Minister of the Information Bureau, gave a speech entitled "Gandhi, the Eternal Soul of India." Then, Mr. Nagai Ryutaro, Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the Great Political Association, gave a speech entitled "Heaven Fights with Gandhi." Finally, Chairman Mizuno led the entire assembly in shouting "Long live the Emperor," and then Mr. Toyama Mitsuru led the entire assembly in shouting "Long live Indian Independence" three times, and the meeting adjourned amidst enthusiastic emotions.</p>
<p>Okumura Delivers Speech on Saving India</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Information Bureau Vice-Minister Okumura delivered a speech today at the Relief for Indian Nationals Rally. The main points are as follows: Gandhi has started his sorrowful struggle again with his only weapon of fasting to resist Britain, and has attracted the attention of the world. Our Japanese people, while building Greater East Asia, are willing to provide assistance with fiery enthusiasm. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan had also provided assistance to India, but due to the infinite deception and obstruction of the British and Americans, it was unable to help India achieve independence. During the last World War, Britain used the promise of Indian independence as a condition to drag India into the vortex of war, but in return for the great sacrifices of Indian people and materials, it broke its promise and massacred Indian patriots seeking independence, and imposed the Rowlatt Act, which was enacted by British officials to suppress 400 million innocent Indian people. The outbreak of the Manchurian Incident further increased Gandhi's hope for Indian independence, and India was also full of the momentum of the independence movement. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Burma and the Philippines, which had long been dominated and ravaged by the British and Americans, were finally liberated by Japan. Gandhi believed in Prime Minister Tojo's statement and hoped that the British and American troops would withdraw from India. Because he called for independence, he was thrown into prison by the brutal British. The 400 million Indian people, you should fight for the independence of India. Japan will not hesitate to provide you with all assistance.</p>

<h3>Axis Positions in North Africa Consolidated, Greater Freedom of Movement, Allied Generals Hold Meeting, Large Numbers of British Troops Gather in Medenine Area</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - A Swedish newspaper correspondent in London reports that the British are gradually becoming disappointed with the situation in central Tunisia. They believe that General Rommel still holds the initiative and has the advantage, and that the freedom of movement obtained by his troops' suitable advances is greater than that of the Allied forces. Moreover, the so-called Tunisian corridor, with an area roughly equal to Ireland, is conducive to the deployment of troops, so it is very easy for the Axis forces to concentrate, while the British First and Eighth Armies are separated by a distance of 600 kilometers. British military personnel expect the Axis forces to make the most of this advantage to prevent Allied action.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to North African news relayed from London yesterday, General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in North Africa, has left his headquarters and gone to a certain place behind the front line to hold a meeting. It is said that General Alexander and other Allied generals will participate.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a front-line correspondent for the London Times, Vice Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in North Africa, General Alexander, and the heads of the American forces have agreed to have him take command of the Tunisian front.</p>
<p>Tangier, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The General Headquarters of the Allied Forces in North Africa announced today that the British Air Force in North Africa will merge with the American Air Force and be called the Northwest African Air Force, commanded by Major General Spaatz, the current Commander of the American Air Force in North Africa. As for the air force in the Mediterranean region, it will be under the command of British Air Marshal Tedder. In addition, the commander of the bomber squadron is American General Doolittle, and the air force ground forces are commanded by General Coningham.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - The British Eighth Army is now gathering in Medenine and Kettake, deploying troops in preparation for an offensive. Therefore, there was only reconnaissance activity on the southern part of the Tunisian front yesterday. Artillery fire in the central and northern parts of Tunisia broke the silence of the line from time to time. The Axis forces are carrying out a planned retreat near the Algerian border, and have not been pursued by the British army due to effective rearguard cover.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Havas News Agency) - Land battles in Tunisia have become quiet today. The Axis forces have broken the main force of the American army in the middle, preventing it from supporting the British Eighth Army in its advance, and have already reached the main point, and are now consolidating their positions. Berlin claims that the heavy losses of American soldiers and equipment have completely thwarted the Allied plan. The American army lost 400 tanks and a large number of vehicles. A war report from the Allied Headquarters in North Africa stated that the Allied forces had retreated some days ago, and then moved towards the Kasserine Pass after attacking the German rearguard. British infantry and American tanks were dispatched together, and occupied the high ground northeast and southwest of the pass, but the German positions were consolidated and covered with landmines. The Allied forces recovered 10 to 15 miles of territory in the Spiba area.</p>
<p>Axis Forces in Tunisia Concentrating Towards Gafsa</p>
<p>However, the Axis forces in central Tunisia are now concentrating from the Gafsa area. The air forces of both sides are becoming more active today. According to Italian war reports, the port of Bona in Algeria was bombed by the Italian air force, and three Allied merchant ships in the port sank. At the same time, German planes also bombed Algiers and Tripoli. American planes bombed various targets in Medenine. The Allied forces claimed to have sent planes to bomb the ports of Sbeitla, Gafsa, and Bizerte.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced the Tunisian war situation on the 26th, stating that the entire Tunisian front was relatively stable on the 25th. After the Axis forces finished their mopping-up operations in the southeast of the front, they were unfolding their operations according to plan.</p>
<h3>Kurusu Delivers Speech, Denounces British and American Conspiracies, American War Aims Are To Dominate the World</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador Saburo Kurusu made a final effort to negotiate with the United States in November two years ago, and hurriedly flew to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he returned home on the first Japanese-American exchange ship in August last year. This afternoon at 1:00 p.m., he delivered a speech at a lecture meeting sponsored by the Great Political Association in the Nakanoshima Public Hall in Osaka, entitled "Japanese-American Negotiations and British-American Strategies," frankly pointing out that the British and Americans had used their insincere strategies against Japan's diplomacy to maintain world peace, and especially put forward the following three points: (1) The breakdown of Japanese-American negotiations was a far-reaching strategy of the British and Americans; (2) The American war aim is to dominate the world, and even Britain is in danger of being sacrificed, so there are also opponents of the war in the United States; (3) Japan is now working together to establish world peace, and is exerting all its strength in the Greater East Asia region with tens of thousands of people to jointly complete the war, in order to establish East Asian co-prosperity. In his speech, Ambassador Kurusu first pointed out the reasons for the United States to provoke the war. Secondly, Ambassador Kurusu explained the common strategy of the British and Americans, saying that Churchill sent pro-war elements to oppose former British Prime Minister Chamberlain's European coordination policy, and cooperated with Roosevelt to launch a siege against Germany. Then, he mentioned Roosevelt's determination to participate in the war after the defeat of Dunkirk, and the various processes by which the Churchill faction sacrificed Britain to establish a plan to get the United States to participate in the war. At this point, he pointed out that the United States did not participate in the war solely because of Britain's instigation, but wanted to take the place of Britain in order to secure its leading position in the world. After the United States entered the war, it used economic pressure on Latin American countries to force them to declare war on or sever diplomatic relations with Japan, Germany, and Italy, and ordered the confiscation or freezing of the property of Japanese, German, and Italian people in those countries, and expelled or imprisoned a large number of Axis country expatriates, overturning the rights and interests of Japan, Germany, and Italy in Central and South America. This, together with the expulsion of British capital mentioned above, is a sign that the United States is trying to completely place Central and South America under its control. All these facts are sufficient to prove that the United States' work to dominate the world is progressing steadily. Recently, there have been frequent rumors of fierce infighting between Britain and the United States, centered on the North African issue and the Indian issue. From this, we can clearly understand what the United States has gained and what it intends to do after entering the war. However, although the United States is engaged in war with the aim of dominating the world, it is still wary of criticism from home and abroad, so it has repeatedly denied Anglo-Saxon domination of the world. However, President Roosevelt and other important figures still advocate dismantling the armed forces of Japan, Germany, and Italy and controlling the world by international police, that is, the military force of Britain and the United States, as the goals after the war. The American war aim is to dominate the world, as mentioned above, but the traditional foreign policy of the United States tends to be completely opposite to this. Members of Congress have also repeatedly raised discussions, strongly advocating that the government should make the war aims more obvious, and oppose the President's autocratic power, and demand an investigation into the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, and fiercely oppose the United States government's policy of dominating the world. At the beginning of this year, the British believed that this situation in the United States was enough to promote the rise of isolationists, and expressed great concern. Recently, the United States published a white paper, and Roosevelt also repeatedly boasted in his address to Congress on January 7 that the war situation had improved and that the expansion of production capacity had been effective. As for the conference recently held by Roosevelt and Churchill in Canada, its intention was also to deal with the situation in the United States. Looking back on when we were restricted by the United States, some people in the United States advocated racial equality with the aim of comforting the Indian independence movement and manipulating the Chongqing government, but we have never heard that the United States has deleted a single line from the immigration law. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for the brilliant results achieved in all aspects, and express my admiration for the hard work and struggles of the soldiers on the front line. Our friendly country, China, also resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, in order to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation. Moreover, Burma and the Philippines, because of Prime Minister Tojo's speech in the Diet on January 28, have obtained a promise of independence. All of this is a glorious construction of Asia, and we should congratulate you together. In the future, externally, we should consolidate our alliance with allied countries, and internally, we should be of one mind under the majesty of the Emperor, and vow to fight to the end to win the final victory.</p>

<h3>Chile Decides to Release Japanese and German Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Santiago, the Chilean government authorities detained 74 Japanese overseas Chinese and 168 German overseas Chinese in various cities in the south after severing diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. According to confirmed news, the Chilean government has decided to release three-tenths of the detained Japanese and German overseas Chinese based on the situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Overseas Chinese Experts to Be Hired to Develop Nanyang Resources</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Allied News Agency) - The East Asia Enlightenment Alliance plans to hire 3,000 experts from among Japanese overseas Chinese who have withdrawn from North, Central, and South America to develop the natural resources of Nanyang, such as cotton, hemp, oak, and timber.</p>
<h3>Thailand Changes Minister of Commerce</h3>

<h3>Aoki Points Out That Shanghai Should Be the Center of Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, in response to a question raised by Congressman Kimura Takeo at the House of Representatives' North China Development Corporation Bill Committee this afternoon, said that the focus of China's construction is to increase production, and Shanghai should be made the center of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. The general idea is that it is urgent for China's construction to focus on increasing production. In fact, many people who are suitable for this kind of construction now live in Shanghai. In the past, there were not a few who adopted a wait-and-see attitude, but in view of the development of the war situation and Japan's definite policy, their trend is also becoming more and more obvious. As for Shanghai, now that the concession has been returned to the national government, Shanghai should be made a major economic city in China and start a new development. However, the specific matters are in the hands of the National Government. In my opinion, Shanghai should be the center of Chinese industry and commerce, and should be made a place for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation to promote its development.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Confined for Rest, Will Broadcast if Health Permits</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Allied News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, President Roosevelt is still not fully recovered from a slight intestinal ailment. Yesterday's press conference was cancelled. The president will take a few days of rest and is currently living quietly in his private residence and will not meet any guests until he has recovered his health.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington telegram, President Roosevelt, if his health improves satisfactorily, will broadcast a speech at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in North Africa, and Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, will follow Roosevelt and broadcast speeches.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister to Visit the United States</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington telegram, American officials are very interested in Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's upcoming visit to the United States. Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that important issues related to the two countries will be discussed at that time.</p>
<h3>Spellman's Mission to Italy</h3>
<p>Vatican City, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Well-informed sources at the Vatican said that Archbishop Spellman of New York's visit here will not produce any surprising results. President Roosevelt merely wants to use this to show the 30 million Catholics in the country the close relationship between the United States and the Vatican. It is very likely that the talk that Washington will sign a religious agreement with the Vatican will become a reality. If the Pope elects new members of the Holy College in the future, Spellman will undoubtedly be the first to be elected. Also, President Roosevelt deeply hopes that the Pope will be able to independently take care of the living conditions of prisoners in Soviet territory, and is expected to put pressure on the Soviet government to force it to recognize the Vatican as the only intermediary for exchanging prisoner information and accept this plan. It is not yet known whether the Vatican intends to accept Roosevelt's suggestions.</p>
<h3>Italy's Total War Posture</h3>
<p>Due to the importance of the Soviet front, the increasingly urgent situation in the Mediterranean has caused Fascist Italy to enter a complete total war posture. Especially in the political, military, and diplomatic aspects, it is necessary to implement a strong wartime policy. What is Italy's future direction? What preparations are being made? These are gradually becoming apparent in recent developments.</p>
<p>After the major cabinet reshuffle in Italy, the new situation in wartime policies can be roughly summarized as follows:</p>
<p>First, in the political aspect, from the first announcement of the change of major cabinet members on February 5 to today, a total of ten new ministers, eleven vice-ministers, thirty-four senators, ten Fascist councilors, and twenty-one local governors have been appointed, which is the largest adjustment since the Fascist Party came to power. Prime Minister Mussolini had this intention at the beginning of Italy's participation in the war, and it was finally implemented due to the sharp turn of the situation. In essence, it can be said to be a national general mobilization cabinet with no talent left unused. Mussolini also serves as the Minister of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Army, Navy, and Air Force. This move gives us the impression that it is based on an independent and autonomous policy to complete the victory.</p>
<p>Mussolini's return as Foreign Minister is the biggest event in the diplomatic aspect. Referring to the importance of Italy's international position at present, we can speculate that Italy's new diplomatic policies will have great developments in the future. The appointment of Count Anno as the ambassador to the Holy See is even more noteworthy. This is the first voice of Mussolini's diplomacy, and from this, it can be inferred that the situation will gradually become more active due to the cooperation with the Vatican's diplomacy.</p>
<p>Second, the appointment of Francesco Gondar, a powerful figure in the Fascist Party, as Governor of Dalmatia can be seen as a manifestation of Italy's strengthening of its Balkan policy. Agusto Rosso, a talented Italian diplomat and former ambassador to the Soviet Union, has been appointed as ambassador to Turkey, which also shows that Turkey, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Balkans are the most important areas in Italy's new diplomacy. The ambassador to Germany will also be changed. The voice of Raifeal, Galigeli, the former ambassador to the Holy See, to succeed is very high. After the outbreak of this war, until it participated in the war in 1940, … [unclear text] mainly diplomacy, and therefore developed into a German-Italian integrated Axis diplomacy due to the opportunity, strengthening cooperation with the Axis group, and promoting an active and autonomous diplomatic policy in the Holy See and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In the military aspect, General Amprochio, who has a well-deserved reputation, has been appointed as the Chief of General Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He is the builder of Italy's mechanized corps and has made great achievements in the Balkan War. During the war against Abyssinia, he served as the commander of the Palermo Army, and used his troops like a god in the Mediterranean, making him the only suitable person to break the current difficult situation in Italy. He is trusted by the Italian people as a cadre in the Italian army, but he is apolitical and a purely simple soldier.</p>
<p>Under Minister of the Army Mussolini, the next officer … [unclear text] … typical military man. This time, the military's adjustment allows the commander and military affairs to be separated from political strategy and dedicated to war.</p>
<p>In the economic and social sectors, not to mention the strengthening of wartime life, but the realization of this total war posture, such as the original Military Supplies Production Supervision Bureau, has been upgraded to the Ministry of Military Supplies. Regarding production and allocation, even those belonging to the Army, Navy, and Air Force are all controlled by the Minister of Military Supplies. All of Italy's production is now separated from civilian relations and mobilized for military purposes. Under the newly formed ministers, all of the dynamic measures have been adopted to subject the economic life to military training in the future, and the current labor force of 2.5 million in Italy will be rapidly strengthened again.

<h3>Current State of Food Rationing in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Kuibyshev by Watanabe, 20th) The war has caused the Soviet people to make many significant sacrifices, among which the food problem is the most prominent. In reality, since the beginning of the war, the Soviet people have been subject to extreme restrictions on food under a strict coupon system. Regarding the food problem, the Soviet Union had bitter experiences in the past. From the First World War to the revolution, it fell into a state of near starvation. According to records from that time, residents of Moscow, Leningrad, and other major cities could only obtain less than 50 grams of bread per day – a thin slice to satisfy the hunger of the entire day. Leningrad, in particular, was the most distressed among the major cities.</p>
<p>The lack of food would inevitably lead to anti-government sentiment. The Soviet authorities have not forgotten this bitter experience, so they always pay the utmost attention to the food problem. Preparations were made long before the start of the German-Soviet war and implemented immediately after the war began. The first of these was the current coupon system. The Soviet coupon system has the following three distinctive features:</p>
<p>First, restriction or standardization of food product types. Currently, the types of food products are restricted to the following five:</p>
<p>(A) Bread, (B) Fats – butter? lard, cheese, vegetable oil, (C) Meat (including fish), (D) Sugar, (E) Wheat flour.</p>
<p>Second, focusing all efforts on increasing production, transportation, and supply of the above food products.</p>
<p>Third, the organized implementation of this coupon system.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is now concentrating all its strength on the war against Germany. Their slogan is: "Everything for the front, everything for victory." Food is naturally sent to the front lines first. The war inevitably causes a decline in food production. To remedy this, the Soviet government has adopted the following five measures:</p>
<p>First, a complete ban on the export of food products;</p>
<p>Second, suppressing food consumption;</p>
<p>Third, increasing grain purchases from collective farms;</p>
<p>Fourth, expanding farmland in the eastern and Siberian regions;</p>
<p>Fifth, importing some food products.</p>
<p>In addition to the coupon system, there are special measures for food supply. Since last spring, organizations similar to cooperatives have been established in major factories. These organizations provide a certain amount of food to each factory, or they can eat in the canteens operated by these organizations. The quantity of food supplied by the coupon system is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Daily bread ration – 800 grams for laborers, 600 grams for general employees, 400 grams for unemployed women and children.</p>
<p>(2) Monthly fat ration – 400 grams for laborers, 300 grams for general people, 200 grams for women and children.</p>
<p>(3) Monthly meat ration – 1,800 grams for laborers, 1,200 grams for general people, 500 grams for women and children.</p>
<p>(4) Sugar ration is unknown.</p>
<p>(5) Monthly wheat flour ration – 1,200 grams for laborers, 800 grams for general people, ration for women and children is unknown.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is clear that the food situation in the Soviet Union is not sufficient, only enough to ensure the minimum necessary for life. When I visited Moscow last November, a citizen who had experienced the difficulties of the revolutionary era told the reporter:</p>
<p>"The current food situation is much better than normal. At least we don't have to starve now. Of course, we can't eat our fill now, but for the sake of the war, we must endure this difficult situation. We can endure it now."</p>

<h3>A Glimpse into Wartime Life in Germany</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Berlin by Oshima, 20th) Following the general mobilization of labor, the order restricting non-essential wartime shops, and the ban on handicrafts, Finance Minister Funk also explained the tax increase proposal at a meeting of the Reichsbank. The Second World War, after three and a half years of fighting, has hit the bottom of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. The deepening of total war is gradually emerging on the streets of Berlin. The first labor application, which ended on the 15th of last month, can be regarded as the mobilization order for women. From businesswomen and female students to barmaids and maids, women of all classes have come to register in various locations in the city.</p>
<p>Shops have posted notices announcing temporary closures, to reopen after the war. On the bustling main streets, shops have pulled down their iron gates. Among them, car showrooms, high-end pottery shops, antique shops, stationery stores, and candy stores have all been closed. Flower shops have turned into vegetable stores, candy stores have become food stores, and bars have become restaurants.</p>
<p>In the publishing industry, there were originally 2,500 types of magazines. Now, all magazines, weekly publications, and film magazines that are not necessary for the war have been discontinued. From this week onwards, there will only be one major news reporting agency, and only 250 magazines on politics, economics, and health.</p>
<p>The sports world has also been affected. Professional sports such as boxing, tennis, golf, skiing, skating, and cycling will all be banned in the future. The first to respond to the new situation was the Berlin City Subway Corporation, which sent forty to fifty female transport workers to the front lines after completing special education.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, in the replacement of male and female jobs, most women have occupied men's positions, creating an all-female situation. Factories are also taking this opportunity to use women and foreign workers to replace operations, except for the minimum amount of expertise.</p>
<p>Universities have a temporary one-week holiday. The graduation exams for the semester begin all at once from this week. As a result, students have stopped their studies and are going out on the streets. The people all maintain their belief in victory. The retreat from Stalingrad and Rostov makes everyone understand how to live in the future, in order to overcome the difficulties and achieve victory. This new revolution is led by Propaganda Minister Goebbels, a right-wing member of the party. He first consulted with President Hitler and discussed it with the three services, Minister of Munitions Speer, Director-General of Conscription Wuerz, and Chairman of the Labor Conscription Committee Sauckel. After detailed planning, it will be implemented vigorously. (Source: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 22)</p>
<h3>Germany Holds Munitions Production Conference - Goebbels Publishes Essay - Denounces Jewish Calamity in Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin, February 27 (Havas) The conference recently held in Plassenburg Castle in Franconia, Germany, discussed Germany's munitions production plan. It was chaired by Munitions Minister Speer, and a total of 140 munitions experts from various European countries attended. The meetings were held daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., with only a slight break for meals. Speer did not deliver a formal opening speech at the opening, but only asked the experts to express their opinions frankly and provide practical opinions on the munitions production issue. According to Speer, the reports received from all parties have shown that Germany's munitions production work is progressing smoothly, production is increasing, and efforts are being made to save raw materials. This has now achieved remarkable results. Improving production methods and reducing costs have also saved the country millions of marks.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 27 (Havas) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "German Magazine" stating that the present is the most difficult time in Western Europe. Our struggle is related to life and death, not only to protect the lives of the German people, but also to safeguard the future of Europe. German soldiers are fighting on the Eastern Front, vowing to prevent the spread of the Red Peril. The material and spiritual aspects of Europe are now facing an unprecedented crisis. Therefore, Germany has made total preparations. All of this is caused by the disruptive behavior of international Jewry, who spare no effort to seize and monopolize world power by various despicable means, but ultimately failed. The Bolsheviks also want to destroy Western civilization, and Britain and the United States are helping them to do evil, resulting in today's world conflagration. If Europe does not try to reinvigorate itself under such circumstances, the disaster will be immense. However, Europe has clearly recognized this crisis and there has been a significant expression of the interconnectedness of Europe, so it must be able to protect Europe from the Jewish catastrophe.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 27 (Havas) German Deputy Director of Information Sundermann recently published an article in the "People's Observer" entitled "The War is not on the Warta River in Germany, but on the Mius River," reviewing the current military and political situation, stating briefly that the war is still ongoing on the Eastern Front and has not shifted to Central Europe. The strategy adopted by the German High Command has prevented Soviet troops from infiltrating Europe. The losses suffered in this winter war have been extremely significant, but the cleanliness of Europe has been preserved by the German army, and there is nothing to worry about in the future.</p>

<p>Prague, February 27 (Havas) The government of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia announced a general mobilization of Czech labor at a mass meeting last night.

<h3>Many German Newspapers and Magazines Suspended Publication</h3>

<h3>Finnish Prime Minister's Choice to Be Determined Soon</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, February 27 (Havas) A correspondent for the Stockholm Dagens Nyheter in Helsinki reports that the most promising successor to the Finnish Prime Minister is Kivilamki, the country's ambassador to Germany. The Social Democratic Party is strongly opposed to appointing a member of the Agrarian Party or a right-wing figure as Prime Minister and advocates for the re-election of the current Prime Minister Rangel, but this proposal is strongly opposed by the Agrarian Party. Kivilamki has now returned to Helsinki today. It will soon be announced who will hold the position of Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>Stalin Receives Polish Ambassador</h3>
<p>Istanbul, February 27 (Havas) Stalin met with Rommer, the ambassador of the Polish government-in-exile in London, yesterday. Foreign People's Commissar Molotov also participated in the talks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, February 27 (Havas) Since the Moscow "Pravda" published an article on the Polish issue, Polish people in exile in London have become uneasy. Now, the British "New Statesman and Nation" has published a detailed Moscow dispatch, implying that the British government has no intention of protecting Poland's eastern border and that the Soviet sphere of influence will extend to Eastern Europe, which has made the Polish people even more apprehensive.</p>
<h3>Ciano Meets the Pope to Present Credentials</h3>
<p>Vatican City, February 27 (Havas) Italian Ambassador to the Holy See Ciano (former Foreign Minister) is scheduled to meet the Pope the day after tomorrow to present his credentials.</p>
<h3>Disputes Over British Security Plan Continue</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, February 26 (Havas) According to messages received here, disputes over the "Beveridge Social Security Plan" continue within the British government. After Labor Minister Bevin virtually broke with the Labor Party Executive Committee a few days ago, the Labor Party has not yet found a solution to the various difficulties that have arisen. Moreover, political observers point out that the positions taken by the Labor Party members in the government differ greatly from the various decisions made by the Labor Party itself. At the same time, it is also heard that the Labor Party is now requesting the immediate commencement of research on the establishment of a Department of Social Welfare, so that the department can be formally established as soon as the war ends.</p>
<h3>Donets West German Forces Carry Out Counteroffensive Successfully - Soviet Encirclement Net Has Been Breached - German Reinforcements Ensure Spring Offensive Base</h3>
<p>Berlin, February 27 (Havas) The weather in the central section of the Eastern Front is still extremely cold, which is probably the only reason for the activity of the Soviet troops in the area. According to recent news here, although the Soviet troops launched a major offensive south of Lake Ilmen, they achieved nothing. The Soviet troops also have a tendency to attack southwest of Kaluga. The point where the enemy troops broke through the German defense line in the Sukhinichi area not only cannot expand their battle results, but has also been encircled by the German army. The Soviet attack north of Sukhinichi is as fierce as the battle south of Oryol in order to achieve victory, but things are far from their wishes, and victory is still far away. The Soviet advance towards Konotop has not stopped, but its momentum is no longer as rapid as before. The German counteroffensive in the western Donets is proceeding smoothly. The second important railway junction southwest of Izyum, which was occupied by the Soviet army a few weeks ago, has been recaptured by the German army, and a part of the Soviet army has been surrounded. The Soviet attack in the Mozhaisk area has failed, and there are only local battles there now.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, February 27 (Central News Agency) The battle on the southern front of the Eastern Front has been stalemated due to the German forces' preparation for an attack and the obstruction of "General Mud." Especially in the northwest of Rostov, the Soviet offensive seems to have been completely thwarted due to the fierce German counteroffensive. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 26th, it was also reported that the Soviet army in that area was facing a crisis, implying that the southern front was gradually slowing down due to the early arrival of this year's spring weather, and the German army had gradually gained an advantage in several areas. The Soviet army's organ newspaper Red Star also strongly urged that the speed and scale of the current winter counteroffensive must be increased as soon as possible. In order to ensure the base for the spring offensive, the German army is sending reinforcements to the front line, so the German counteroffensive in various places has become more intense.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, February 27 (Havas) Judging from recent news from Berlin, the German army is still conducting encirclement battles between the Donets River and the Dnieper River. Moscow also admits that the battle in the Donets River basin is benefiting the German army, and said that the German army has launched a major counteroffensive towards Kramatorsk and Krasnoarmeysk, but the cities are still being held by the Red Army. In other areas, the Soviet army is still adopting an offensive posture. In view of the fact that the Red Army's offensive has greatly eased, the comments published in Soviet newspapers are also very cautious. The Red Army's organ newspaper "Red Star" stated that the German army is launching a fierce counteroffensive in the Donets River basin, especially in the Kramatorsk area, and we should be especially vigilant.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for Soviet Tank Units - Germans Repel Soviet Troops Attacking Across Ice</p>
<p>Berlin, February 27 (Havas) Havas learned last night from well-informed sources here that the Soviet tank units that were defeated by the German army between the Donets River and the Dnieper River in the past few weeks suffered heavy losses. The army lost a total of 479 tanks, 97 cannons, 188 anti-tank guns, 18 anti-aircraft guns, 54 howitzers, 143 armored vehicle transporters, 300 trucks, and a large number of other war materials. The number of dead and wounded in the army was also very tragic. Three German teams participating in the battle killed 12,000 enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>Berlin, February 27 (Havas) Those responsible recently stated that the elite Soviet troops attacked across the ice on Lake Ilmen and failed. After the Soviet troops reached the lake, Peter was violently sealed, and the few soldiers who were able to reach the shore were still repelled by the German army on the shore. In this battle, more than 2,000 corpses were left by the Soviet side. Among the spoils of war obtained by the German side were 1,500 pieces of ice.</p>

<p>Deadline for Supplementing Sugar Ration Payments</p>
<p>The Cooperative Business Office issued a notice yesterday stating that in regard to the February sugar ration, a previous notice stated that payments would be made on a preliminary basis, pending the Office's determination of the price for final settlement.

Payments made by the sugar merchants to this Office must also be settled according to the new prices by March 2. This notice is hereby issued, along with the attached list of newly set prices. It is hoped that all sugar merchants and Type A retail merchants will be informed accordingly.</p>
<p>Special Sugar Allocation for Business Needs</p>
<p>Type B retail merchants are only allowed to use the allocated sugar to process food and are not allowed to resell the original sugar. Applicants are limited to sugar confectionery factories, biscuit factories, restaurants, etc., with legitimate business needs. After the implementation of headcount-based sugar allocation, in order to maintain the legitimate needs of various industries, a decision has been made to continue to allocate sugar. Regarding the February Type B allocation, according to Shanghai News Agency reporters' inquiry to the Cooperative Business Office yesterday, the review has been completed, and sugar purchase permits will be issued on March 1. Payments must be made according to the newly set prices within the deadline for picking up the goods. As for the special allocation prices for each household in February, they will all be handled according to the newly set prices.</p>

<h3>Japanese Embassy Office Discusses Ideological Integration</h3>
<p>The Japanese "Continental News" reports that the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office held a regular cadre meeting on the 25th. Minister Tajiri and all section chiefs attended to discuss policies adapting to the changing administrative period. One point, promoting the integration of Chinese and Japanese ideologies, is most noteworthy. It states that it is difficult to achieve the purpose of increasing production, construction, and economy without integrating the thinking of the peoples of China and Japan. At present, the Cultural Department of the Embassy Office is trying to integrate Chinese and Japanese ideologies. Existing ideological and cultural organizations include the Central China Religious Unity League, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and social service groups. However, these are guided in activity by responsible officials, which makes it impossible to freely develop and difficult to obtain results. Leaders cannot advance appropriate policies because of their official positions. To remove this obstacle, all parties hope that the current leaders will resign from their official positions and participate in various groups as leaders. Otherwise, it is impossible to establish a Sino-Japanese cultural and ideological integration adapted to the changing administrative period.</p>

<h3>To Prevent Rice Ticket Fraud, West Shanghai Checks Household Registration</h3>
<p>Since the West Shanghai District Office has been handling the public sale of rice in West Shanghai, a few unscrupulous members of the Baojia system have been engaged in rice ticket fraud, which has greatly affected the people's food supply.

It is reported that the office is now actively engaged in checking household registration. Investigators have been dispatched to investigate in all directions.

More than a month has passed since then. The industry urgently needs coal, and it is hoped that the authorities will fairly distribute and sell it.</p>
<h3>Three Years After Li Yinhen's Murder, the Murderer is Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Li Yinhen, from Liaoning, was engaged in trading, traveling between Shanghai and Kunming, carrying a large sum of money with him. On October 24th, 1940, Li arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou and stayed in room 305 of the Continental Apartment in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, his evil friend Wang Chengnai (i.e., Zhang Bingsheng) found out about it and had the idea of ​​killing him for money. He colluded with Wang Fusheng (i.e., Crooked Head), Shi Jinquan, Hua Xiaodi, etc., to design to lure Li to room 401 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road, strangled him with a rope, and seized a passbook. After inspection, there was only more than 1,000 yuan in savings, which was divided and used. Three years later, Hua Deputy Detective Chen Jinsheng, Detective Zhang Faxiang, and Detective Ju Xingmei of the New Gate Police Station successively arrested the above four criminals and sent them to the First Special Court. After clear interrogation, Judge Zhu Chuzhe ascended the seat and announced the verdict yesterday morning.

<h3>Clearing Cadre Training Institute to Open on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the National Government's Clearing Affairs Committee, in order to select cadres and staff, specially organized the Clearing Cadre Staff Training Institute, with Director Chen Jian personally serving as the director. Students were recruited for the Zaozhi Baojia Political Work Blockade classes. Apart from the announcement of the students admitted to the Blockade class, the others have all been announced yesterday. All admitted members are also limited to report to the institute for registration and fill out certificates on the previous two days. It is understood that a total of 600 members will be trained this time, divided into two phases, and the opening date is March 1st.</p>
<h3>"Good Officials" and "Good Institutions" are the Necessary Preparations for Recovering Concessions and Extraterritoriality</h3>
<p>Whether the Chinese people understand Japan's righteous and Mahayana spirit is a question for the future for the time being. I think the focus of the problem is how the National Government will prepare to accept Japan's current return of concessions and abolition of extraterritorial rights, which is a realistic move in history. -</p>
<p>Mr. Takada of Murakami Law Office, in a calm but passionate tone, narrated the above paragraph from the conclusion. He also said: "The institution that acts as a good official" is a prerequisite, but as the saying goes, "It is easy to know, but difficult to do." Preparing to solve difficult problems cannot be successful overnight.</p>
<p>According to my observation, among the many people in Shanghai, except for the youth, few express concern and sympathy for the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The concessions are their place to relax, and this habit is deeply imprinted in their minds, so people who are immersed in this atmosphere have worn away all their ambitious aspirations. However, this can also be said to be generated in the psychology of only taking care of personal interests and distrusting the guiding and supervising institutions. In other words, it is the people's passive resistance to the previous government's distrust. This affection is also evident in the judiciary, as I can see personally. The people are very indifferent to the special zone court, and almost all litigation cases are resolved by lawyers in mediation. Then, even if the Chinese side recovers judicial power, police power, etc., it will probably only increase the difficulties for the National Government itself. These words may be too much, but I sincerely hope that after the return, there must be people and institutions with sufficient ability and exceeding the current situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Takada has lived in China for thirteen years and has traveled extensively to Chongqing and other places. He also narrated a historical story from the past, containing a very profound meaning in this interesting recollection. he said.</p>
<p>Shipwreck tragedies often occur in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. When the Nisshin Shipping Company opened the route to Chongqing, the company's ships traveled at full speed, impacting the waves, causing many civilian ships to sink. Although this incident was not enough to constitute anti-Japanese material for the Chinese side, the Nisshin Shipping Company itself considered what methods to use to remedy or compensate. At that time, because it was not easy to decide, I was entrusted to study the aftermath of this matter, so I went to Chongqing to investigate locally, but there was no way to solve it legally. Later, I discovered that the only way to deal with these shipwreck incidents was for the boatmen to insure themselves. They knew the company's sincerity and took the initiative to find ways to avoid shipwreck tragedies, which later reduced many shipwreck incidents. Therefore, my conclusion about the shipwreck incident is that the sinking of the ship was caused by one's own carelessness.</p>
<p>The above words show a character of the Chinese people. It can be seen that as long as you reason with reality, the people will inevitably be sincerely convinced. Therefore, you must have firm sincerity and great efforts to prepare for this work.</p>
<p>I hope the National Government will do its best to prepare to meet the times. (Qiqing: Translated from the Mainland News on February 27)</p>

<h3>A Large Amount of Bean Flour Will Be Refined to Provide Household Miscellaneous Grains; The Quality and Taste are No Different from Soybean Flour and Wheat Flour; Noodle Product Merchants Requesting Flour Allocation is Under Discussion</h3>
<p>Recently, the Concession authorities are about to issue miscellaneous grain purchase certificates. However, the scope of miscellaneous grains is very broad, and what type of distribution will be given is of great concern to all parties. According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the beans used by oil mills in this city are of very good quality. After refining and making them into powder, their quality and taste are the same as soybean flour and are no different from wheat flour. A large amount has recently been produced, and it will soon be distributed by the authorities. Therefore, the miscellaneous grains distributed by the Concession authorities are probably of this type.</p>
<p>Flat-Price Soybean Sales Insufficient to Meet Demand</p>
<p>In addition, the miscellaneous grains provided by the Grain Maintenance Group Liaison Office are all supplied to retail stores, and most retail stores do not sell them at the prescribed prices, so citizens rarely benefit. As for the long-rumored 6,000 bags of flat-price soybeans, each tofu shop in this city is assigned to sell seven bags, and fried goods shops, etc., are assigned five bags each. Datong News Agency reporters specially visited the persons in charge of the tofu and fried goods industries yesterday. According to them, the amount distributed by the Miscellaneous Grain Group is far from the actual need, and the difference is huge. It is hoped that the authorities can increase the distribution quantity, so that retail prices can also be suppressed.</p>
<p>Noodle Stalls Hope to Resume Flour Allocation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Association Section and the Materials Control Department have been conducting thorough discussions on the request of noodle product stores and stalls to resume flour allocation. Because there are many workers engaged in this industry, it is intended to resume allocation and production in the short term to show consideration and relief. However, each noodle product trade association must guarantee that the allocated flour will not be sold on the black market and provide a written guarantee of severe punishment for violations, in order to show caution. It is also understood that the Cake and Steamed Bun Trade Association is sending personnel to conduct detailed investigations in order to understand whether the members have used the flour in stock, whether there has been black market trading, and whether the location of the store has changed, in order to report to the authorities and request changes to the methods and provide allocations as soon as possible, in order to maintain the livelihood of colleagues.</p>
<h3>Huai'an Association Donations in the Money Industry Will Increase Across the Board Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Northern Shanghai Money Industry Huai'an Association, which is run by the Shanghai Money Industry Association, has a history of several decades. It provides relief funds to unemployed and destitute people in the industry, as well as to their orphans and impoverished families, to help them make a living. In the past, the Huai'an Association expenses were paid by each business in installments on a regular basis. From last year to this spring, each business paid 20 yuan per month. However, the Executive Committee of the Money Industry Association has repeatedly received proposals from members to increase the amount given to relief households, as the prices of everything are now high and life is difficult. The original amount of relief funds given should be increased, and the source of the relief funds should be started by each business increasing the monthly donation to the Huai'an Association first. This matter was formally passed by this year's annual meeting of managers of each business submitted by the association, and it was immediately decided that starting from March 1st, the monthly donation of each business should be increased to 40 yuan per month. Special donations are not subject to this rule. The increase in donations has been notified to all member businesses by the association for compliance. As for the increase in the amount of relief funds for relief households, it will be implemented as soon as the meeting passes.</p>
<h3>The Thirty-Second Evacuation of Coffins Left in Shanghai; A Large Number Will Be Evacuated Before Qingming</h3>
<p>Since the Guohua Coffin Transportation Department was ordered to evacuate the coffins left in this city, there have been thirty-one evacuations, and fourteen batches of poor coffins have been loaded. It is understood that the thirty-second evacuation of coffins and the fifteenth batch of poor coffins, as well as the coffins of the Siming Guild Hall without family members, totaling 200 coffins, will be transported to Yongbo by the Xinning Shao wheel on March 2. It is reported that the Coffin Transportation Department will meet the urgent needs of the coffin owners in this city and plans to load a large number of coffins left in Shanghai before the Qingming Festival. It is also reported that the next evacuation date has been set for March 6th. Therefore, all coffin owners in this city can go to No. 2, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road to apply for registration in order to be transported to their homeland before the Qingming Festival.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Welfare Will Be Officially Established Tomorrow; Zhang Kechang Appointed as Director; Office Still Located in Zhaofeng Village</h3>
<p>Since the National Government ordered the reorganization of the Social Movement Guidance Committee into the Ministry of Social Welfare, the Shanghai Office of the Social Movement Committee was also ordered to be reorganized into the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Welfare. It is understood that the internal reorganization has now been completed and will officially open tomorrow (March 1st). The new Director Zhang Kechang takes Yu Yaoqiu as the Deputy Director. The address of the office is still No. 69, Zhaofeng Village.</p>
<h3>Levying Fees for School Supplies: Striving to Reduce the Burden on Students; The Municipal Bureau of Education Specifies Eleven Regulations</h3>
<p>In order to standardize the fees charged by municipal elementary schools in Shanghai for school supplies and to reduce the burden on children, the Municipal Bureau of Education has revised the interim measures for collecting school supplies fees starting this semester. The original text of these measures is as follows:</p>
<p>Standardized Amounts, Eliminating Disputes</p>
<p>Article 1 of the "Interim Measures for the Collection of School Supplies Fees by Municipal Elementary Schools in the Shanghai Special Municipality": The Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Education has formulated these measures to standardize the amount of school supplies fees charged by municipal elementary schools and to eliminate disputes arising from school supplies fees.

The school shall purchase these on behalf of the students before the start of each semester and may collect school supplies fees from the students. Article 3: Schools should minimize the collection of school supplies fees to reduce the burden on students' families.</p>
<p>Drastic Price Changes; Separate Regulations</p>
<p>Article 4: Before the start of each semester, the Bureau will determine the maximum amount of school supplies fees for students at each level based on actual needs and will issue an order for all schools to comply with. Under no circumstances shall this amount be exceeded. In the event of drastic price changes, the Bureau will issue separate regulations regarding the maximum amount and will issue an order for implementation. Article 5: When collecting school supplies fees, schools must fill out a receipt in triplicate, one copy to be kept by the school, one copy to be given to the student's parents, and one copy to be submitted to the Bureau within one month after the start of the semester (format attached). Article 6: If the school collects less than the prescribed maximum amount for school supplies fees at the start of the semester, and it is felt that it is insufficient for use during the semester, a second collection may be made. However, the total amount of the two collections shall not exceed the prescribed maximum amount and must be handled in accordance with the procedures in Article 5.</p>
<p>Violation of Regulations: Dismissal</p>
<p>Article 7: Invoices for all school supplies purchased on behalf of the students and one copy of the triplicate receipt shall be submitted to the Bureau for verification at the same time. Article 8: If schools need to collect other fees in addition to school supplies fees due to special circumstances, they must submit a report to the Bureau for approval before they can be collected. Article 9: If any school violates the provisions of Article 4 and Article 8, it will be dismissed from its position upon verification. Article 10: These measures shall take effect from the date of issuance to all schools. Article 11: These measures may be amended at any time if there are any omissions.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Notice Points Out: Shipwreck Location Signal: Located Near Section 10 of Pudong</h3>

<h3>Random Notes on Malaya (5)</h3>
<p>— Voters</p>
<p>(8) New Posture of Malaya</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied the Malay Peninsula of Singapore, it has gradually established a new public order.</p>
<p>The Japanese army divided the former British Malaya and the former Dutch Sumatra into the same military and political jurisdiction, under the jurisdiction of the supreme commander of Malaya, and the Malay military and political supervision department as the executive agency. The characteristics of the Japanese military administration are to integrate Malaya and Sumatra, and within the Malay Peninsula, the Straits Colonies of the directly governed territory and the Federal States and the non-Federal States are uniformly under the control of the military and political organs, without any distinction in the implementation of military and political affairs. The military and political supervisory department is located in Zhaonan Island (renamed Singapore), and under the military and political supervisory department are various departments, and under each department are various sections, which are responsible for the business under their jurisdiction. The branch organizations are located in the original states, namely (A) On the Malaya side, Zhaonan Special City (Zhaonan), (the place where the government is located is in parentheses below, the same below,) Johor (Johor), Malacca (Malacca), Negeri Sembilan (Negeri Sembilan), Selangor (Kuala Lumpur), Perak (Ipoh), Kedah (Alor Setar), Kelantan (Kota Bharu), Terengganu (Terengganu), Pahang (Lipis). B) Sumatra side: Aceh (Kota Raja), East Coast (Medan), Tapanuli (Sibolga), West Coast (Padang), Riau (Pekanbaru), Palembang (Palembang-Parempen,, Jambi (Jambi), Bangka Belitung (Pangkalpinang), Lampung (Telukbetung), Bangka Belitung (Pangkal Pinang). In Zhaonan Special City, under the mayor, there are five departments: General Affairs, People's Livelihood, Business, Economy, and Police. Under the state officials, departments and sections are set up as necessary.</p>
<p>One of the biggest tasks of the current Malayan military administration is to strengthen local administration. The number of Japanese officials has now reached one hundred and ten to thirty. The lower-level organization of local administration is the village, and its organization and functions will not be greatly changed. In order to strengthen guidance, the military and political supervision department has specially established the "East Asia Training Institute" in Zhaonan as a training center for local officials, selecting young people from various states, providing short-term training, and making them members of the local administrative committee.</p>
<p>The judicial institutions have also been allowed to be restored later. The trial court implements a two-instance system of the High Court and the District Court except for religious trials. Under the guidance of the military and political supervision department, some local judges are appointed, and the law also follows the previous principles. In addition, there is a military law conference that conducts special trials on those who endanger the safety of books and the Japanese army.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, the budget headquarters for the fiscal year 1942 was more than 60 million yuan, the accounting of each branch in Malaya was hundreds of millions of yuan (Lek currency), and the accounting of each branch in Sumatra was about 40 million shields a year, totaling 220 million yuan (shields), which is about 70% of the pre-war budget. Among the revenues and expenditures, the revenues are mainly based on taxes, licenses, opium revenue, and regulations, and the expenditures are mainly used for the expenses of revitalizing industries, restoring civil engineering, building wooden ships, health care, and communication undertakings. In terms of revenue, tax system reforms are implemented in accordance with the requirements of the military administration and the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The fundamental policy implemented in finance is to adhere to the principle of "local collection and supply."</p>
<p>In terms of industry, the basic policy of economic construction is, first, to develop and obtain important national defense resources, and second, to seek self-sufficiency for local necessities as much as possible. Most of the industrial facilities have been thoroughly destroyed by the British and Dutch armies before the Japanese army occupied them, but after the day and night efforts of the Japanese army, the production institutions that had been stopped have been successively restored, and the mobilization plan for materials and the ensuring of the necessary production volume have also begun to be realized. The resource developers and transaction managers have also gradually arrived under the guidance of the Japanese army, and factories, mines, and farms are operated by the Japanese army under the entrustment of "military management". Special attention is paid to the acquisition and restoration of production of tin and bauxite in Malaya and petroleum in Sumatra.</p>
<p>Regarding rubber, the Japanese army established a rubber supervision committee when it occupied it to investigate the current situation of rubber tree gardens, collect all stocks, and appoint farm managers to each farm to supervise and manage the original facilities, and the collected stocks were transported back to Japan as quickly as possible. Secondly, it guides Japanese rubber operators to establish the "Zhaonan Rubber Union" to control the production, transportation, purchase and export of all rubber plantations in Malaya and Sumatra.</p>
<p>In addition to rubber, agricultural resources are coconuts, quinine, and bark acid, which are unique products of the tropics, and efforts are also being made to restore their production. In addition, cotton in southern Sumatra and flax in northern Sumatra are also rapidly increasing their production. Under the slogan of "revitalizing Malaya and building Sumatra," the Japanese military administration is working hard to develop the resources of these two major southern treasures.</p>
<p>Malaya is a typical colony under the colonial policy of European and American imperialism. It only pays attention to the development of raw material selling sources such as rubber and tin that are needed by imperialism itself, but the colony has no self-sufficiency in food necessary for the life of the colony, the industry is not developed, and there is no basis for a self-reliance system. Therefore, the main food and all clothing and groceries have to rely on other countries, and there is naturally unspeakable pain in wartime when material exchange is extremely difficult. For this reason, the Japanese army is working hard to establish a local self-sufficiency system as the basis for its current economic policy. The first is food. In Sumatra, the Dutch Indian government had promoted it before the war, and after the Japanese army occupied it, it has reached self-sufficiency. Is it only about 100,000 tons? Need to be imported from Java. The self-sufficiency rate of food in Malaya is only 40%, and the remaining 60% depends on the import of Thai rice and Burmese rice. In view of this, the Malayan military and political supervision department has vigorously launched a food production increase campaign in its jurisdiction since last summer, such as reclaiming wasteland, rectifying irrigation facilities, and distributing high-quality seeds, in order to improve quality, increase the production of corn, sugarcane, miscellaneous grains and other subsidiary foods, and strive to make agricultural finance smoother, encourage excellent farmers, and establish agricultural research institutions, etc., in order to ensure food self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Almost all salt and sugar depend on imports from other places. Salt is imported from Thailand, and sugar is supplied by Java. On the side of strengthening external industries, Japanese experts are also working hard to promote it in order to increase aquatic food products. In northern Sumatra, efforts are being made to promote animal husbandry in order to alleviate the food problem.</p>
<p>Most of the clothes and other daily necessities depend on external imports, and they are naturally even more insufficient, and rising prices are an inevitable phenomenon. In addition to expanding local enterprises to strengthen production, the Japanese occupying authorities are also working hard to make the exchange of materials between the Japanese mainland and the Southern Circle smoother, in order to ensure the supply of daily necessities. At the same time, in order to cope with the reduction of materials, while strictly stipulating that the prices of food and daily necessities are at the pre-war level, and suppressing prices, a ticket rationing system is adopted in order to save money.</p>
<p>The restoration of the industrial sector has also gradually become active with the arrival of Japanese mainland operators. Factories such as rubber, iron plate, lumber, beer, glass, bricks and tiles, and shipbuilding (wooden ships) have been successively started, but they are all small-scale restoration of the original industries, and all the materials needed locally still have to rely on imports from outside. The development of formal local industries still has to wait for the future.</p>
<p>In terms of trade, the first is the transportation of materials from the occupied areas such as petroleum, rubber, bauxite, manganese, iron, tin, leather, bark acid, and coconut back to the country. Secondly, in order to investigate the minimum necessary amount of civilian materials, they are then imported from the mainland, Manchuria and China to realize the economic connection of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Third, for the exchange of materials between the Southern Circle, rice, sugar, salt, poultry, pigs, and miscellaneous grains are supplied by Myanmar, Java, Thailand, etc., and coal and cement are supplied by Sumatra, etc., and they are transported by civilian ships. Zhaonan Island is the center to restore transportation agencies and port facilities, promote the smooth development of local transportation, and adjust the supply relationship of materials.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, the currencies of Malaya and Sumatra are the Lek Yuan military ticket, the shield military ticket and the local currencies, namely the Lek currency and the Java Bank banknote (Malaya uses the Lek currency, and Sumatra uses the shield ticket). It is made to use the military ticket and the local currency at par value, and there is no special uneasy phenomenon in terms of military ticket credit and currency circulation. However, Malaya is the area where the old British currency is used, and Sumatra is the area where the old Dutch currency is used. There is some dual phenomenon in the currency within the current Japanese single military and political area, and the inconvenience of this can be imagined. Therefore, the military and political supervision department has recently implemented a currency exchange system between Malaya and Sumatra, and is working hard to adjust the currency between the two. In terms of financial institutions, in addition to the Yokohama Specie Bank, Taiwan Bank, and South China Bank, which are the three Japanese banks in Singapore before the war, opening "branch offices" of the Yokohama Specie Bank in each state under its jurisdiction, and for the Chinese and Indian banks, some of them are recognized by the Japanese authorities as non-antagonistic, and are also allowed to resume operations, and the "civilian financial institutions" such as pawnshops have also been restored, and "common people's vaults" have also been opened.</p>
<p>In terms of hygiene, Malaya and Sumatra are both on the equator, and the temperature is lower than imagined. There is no particularly unbearable heat throughout the year. After the Japanese army ended the war, they immediately worked hard to implement sanitary measures, cleaned and sorted out rivers and ditches, and implemented universal vaccination and preventive injections for residents, so the sanitary work after the war may be better than before the war.</p>
<p>In terms of education, it was very underdeveloped in the past due to the ignorance policy implemented by the British rulers. More than half of the residents have not received elementary education, and there are very few people who have received secondary or higher education. Except for the private schools set up by wealthy overseas Chinese, all educational and cultural institutions are monopolized by the British, with the first priority being to train slaves. The Japanese occupiers attached importance to the education of local children in accordance with the concept of the "Co-Prosperity Sphere," and paid special attention to the popularization of elementary education, especially Japanese education, which has achieved amazing results.</p>
<p>Local religions include Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. The Japanese occupying authorities adhered to the policy of non-interference in local religions and respected freedom of religion, which is of course one of the main policies for winning people's hearts.</p>
<p>The new posture of Malaya and the newly incorporated Malay area is roughly as follows. However, the bright future still depends on the continued struggle of the local residents, especially the overseas Chinese compatriots who account for the majority! (End)</p>

<h3>Second Round of the Western League Group A: Tung Wah Meets Portuguese Merchants Again Today; Performance in Jiaozhou Park This Afternoon</h3>
<p>In the second round of the Western League Group A football, Tung Wah and Portuguese Merchants will meet again in Jiaozhou Park at 3:45 this afternoon. In the first round, the two teams drew 1-1. This time they meet again, and the Portuguese Merchants may inevitably surrender. The strength of the Portuguese team this season is mediocre. Oliveira, Gaines, V. Suruo and others are not as fierce as before. Although the veteran Victor has made a comeback, the lineup is still not strong. Tung Wah showed their skills in the recent battle against the Italian Navy, and each performance was excellent. In particular, Han Longhai was a general and minister, and had the spirit of one man being in charge and ten thousand men being invincible. For the rest, Mai Youliang's right wing, the technique of passing the ball has reached perfection, and no one else in Shanghai can think of it. Aquie has also recovered his former glory, and Ah Dai, Youren, and Li Ning are all above the standard. Therefore, Tung Wah is confident of victory. There are also two games each in Groups B and C in today's league. The order of today and the lineups of the two teams, Tung Wah and Portuguese Merchants, are recorded separately below:</p>

<h3>Joint Business Office of Chinese Paper Mills Officially Established on Schedule</h3>
<p>In order to suppress the black market for newsprint and comprehensively adjust paper prices, the paper mills in this city are following the instructions of the authorities to organize a trade association in order to investigate the cost statistics of various newspapers and submit them to the authorities for review so that they can legally limit prices, and to organize a joint business office of Chinese paper mills to sell the newspapers produced by various factories under the control of the office, so that hoarding will be impossible to monopolize, and the black market can be suppressed. It is reported that the joint business office has been prepared by the organizers of the association and will be officially established and start business on March 1. However, it will still maintain close contact with Japanese paper mills.</p>
<p>Cigarette Rationing Implemented: Hoarded Goods Released, Black Market Prices Plummeted</p>
<p>Since the Chinese New Year, the price of cigarettes in this city has risen step by step, and the black market price has reached its peak. In order to facilitate the transportation and sales of cigarettes and suppress market prices, the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association decided to implement a unified cigarette rationing method and put it into practice. It actively registered cigarette wholesalers and retailers throughout the city. After the association's review, more than 90 wholesalers and more than 5,500 retailers were qualified. It was decided to start implementing the rationing from the 10th of next month. After the implementation of the rationing, various hoarded goods were released one after another, and the black market on the market plummeted for days. It is predicted that after the implementation of the rationing, the black market can be suppressed.</p>

<h3>The Central Reserve Notes in the Future</h3>
<p>Since the major changes in Shanghai's currency last June, the Central Reserve Notes have become a very unique legal tender. All public and private transactions must be paid in Central Reserve Notes. Months have passed. From the New Year to the early spring, the prices of goods, gold prices, stocks and public debt suddenly showed a galloping labor. Is this a shake in the credit of the Central Reserve Notes? Or is it the mediocrity of the capitalists? The reasons for this will not be discussed for the time being. However, since the Central Reserve Notes are the legal currency of Shanghai, and are complicated for the people's livelihood, we should have a correct understanding of them. In the near future, according to the reporter's observation, there will be three possible developments: First, although the Central Reserve Notes are commonly used in Shanghai, they have not been fully promoted in remote areas. In the future, the government will do its best to promote the Central Reserve Notes through laws or other coercive forces. Since the Central Reserve Notes can be sold and paid in the inland, the Central Reserve Notes in Shanghai can be reduced. Second, the industrial products that Shanghai can continue to produce and the agricultural products that the inland can produce will inevitably be leveled out in price due to the corresponding supply and demand after comprehensive planning and adjustment. Third, military tickets must be gradually recovered with Central Reserve Notes, and Japanese military tickets will not be seen on the market. All items and payments that can be purchased or paid with military tickets must be replaced with Central Reserve Notes, and in the future, only Central Reserve Notes will be able to settle Japanese remittances. If the Japanese exchange rate is increasingly extended, and 100 yuan can be exchanged for 100 yuan, then the economic level of China and Japan can be averaged, and the people's livelihood can also be the same. However, in this time of rapid world war, all estimates cannot be too high. There may be some distance from the above in fact, so we cannot keep excessive hope. In short, in the wartime economy, there is no other way for the people but to endure the pain.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stock Market: Resumption Expected Next Week</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market has been suspended for nearly ten days since the Shanghai Municipal Council inspected the Yongchang and two Chinese stock companies last Thursday, affecting the entire market. It is now learned that the authorities originally had no intention of interfering with the legal trading of Chinese stocks. This incident was only due to concerns that the recent surge in stock prices seemed to involve speculation. The authorities have now completed their inspection, and a satisfactory resolution is expected within the next week. At that time, the Chinese stock market will resume normal trading.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Construction of the National Government Establishes Office in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Leather Shoe Raw Materials Sufficient for Six Months</h3>
<p>The current stock of leather in the Shanghai market is estimated by the leather shoe industry to be sufficient for six months. The current monthly consumption is 9,000 feet of grain leather and 6,000 pounds of sole leather. However, since rubber materials have been adopted for shoe soles, the use of sole leather will be greatly reduced, and it is said that the cost of shoe production can also be reduced by ten percent.</p>
<h3>"Guben" Soap Costs Ten Yuan Per Bar</h3>
<p>Among daily necessities, the price of soap has been rising aggressively since the Lunar New Year. This is because general speculation is rampant, and those holding goods are firmly holding on, not giving up slightly, leading to an increasingly severe trend. For example, "Guben" soap has risen to 1,180 yuan per box, and the price per bar has been sold for ten yuan on the market. "Baixiangmao" costs 1,100 yuan, "Huangxiangmao" 1,000 yuan, "Scissors" soap 1,150 yuan, "Phoenix Brand" matches 6,200 yuan, "Beauty Brand" 6,200 yuan, "Golden Tripod Brand" 4,400 yuan, miscellaneous brands 3,000 yuan, "Price's Patent Candles" 800 yuan, "Monk's Cap Brand" 680 yuan, miscellaneous brands 540 yuan. The selling price of all goods has risen sharply.</p>
<h3>Allied Currency Falls Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank loan interest rate announced by the Bankers' Association was 18%, unchanged.</p>
<p>The Japanese military scrip continued to weaken. The inter-dealer price was 5.5524 yuan, and the buying and selling prices of small money shops and bank counters were also low, at 5.545 and 5.55 yuan. The decline in Allied banknotes was slight. Dealers sold at 3.40 yuan and bought at 3.35 yuan, a slight decrease of 3 cents compared to the previous day. The market trend remains sluggish.</p>
<h3>Government "Bing" Bonds Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market initially showed no signs of recovery, and prices remained sluggish. Later, due to multiple price increases, it rose sharply. "Bing" bonds rose linearly from 1.30 yuan to over 6 yuan. Most of the buyers were old "longs" adding to their positions to push up prices, or a way to find an exit. Other bonds also rose accordingly, but not as strongly as "Bing" bonds.</p>
<h3>Low-Price Matches Allocated Yesterday</h3>
<p>In view of the continuous rise in match prices, the local match allocation association allocated a batch of low-price matches to large and small cigarette stores in the two concessions yesterday in order to curb the rising trend. The allocation was as follows: Grade A cigarette stores, six "tings" (i.e., one case); Grade B cigarette stores, three "tings" (i.e., half a case). The price was still 340 yuan in military scrip, so the retail price per small box at each cigarette store was still 30 cents in Central Reserve Currency, with a limit of ten boxes per person.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains market initially rose and then fell, with the market generally stabilizing.

<h3>White Lead Wire Strengthens</h3>
<p>Although the trading of thick and thin white lead wire is not very active, the market is quite strong due to the shortage of goods. For example, "Tong Hua" grade is quoted at 26,000 yuan per ton, and "Shu Hua" grade requires a slight premium. Spot goods of new lead wire are even scarcer, with an appearance of having a market but no goods. Numbers 8 to 15 are priced at 35,000 yuan, and fine goods at 50,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sugar Merchants' Cooperative: Allocation of Fair-Priced Sugar</h3>
<p>— Zhu Guilin</p>
<p>Organization and Management</p>
<p>Previously, in order to protect the sugar stocks of various members of the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association, the Material Allocation Combination for the Exchange of Chinese Central Bank Notes obtained permission to first register and centrally sell all the white sugar owned by Chinese people and jointly form a Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office to handle it. It was stipulated that any Chinese person, whether a firm or an individual, holding white sugar could participate in the public sale. The registered sugar was divided into six groups: (1) Granulated sugar, (2) Refined white sugar, (3) Brown sugar, (4) Raw sugar, (5) Dark brown sugar, (6) Rock sugar. The Cooperative Office would issue equity certificates to each participant, making them shareholders of the Cooperative. As for sugar that did not participate in the public sale, the military allocation authorities would be notified to purchase it at a fair price. The quota enjoyed by each sugar firm for implementing the allocation was determined separately based on their seniority and business volume at the time of participation. In order to smoothly allocate sugar, district management was implemented, merging the original sugar firms into 58 firms, and the allocation was implemented from February of last year.</p>
<p>Now, in order to manage the allocation more closely and meet the needs, the city's retail locations are divided into seven districts, with designated sugar firms responsible for the allocation and management of all matters. The sugar firms in charge of each district are responsible for supervising and managing the business of the Grade A and Grade B retailers under their jurisdiction in accordance with the following items, and may review their accounts and conduct investigations and records at any time. (Grade A) Retailers' compliance items: (1) Retail sales should be marked with a county price list in accordance with the official price; (2) Weighing should be based on balance scales; (3) Sugar products should not be adulterated; (4) Allocated sugar is only allowed for retail sales; (5) The daily inventory and sales volume should be reported truthfully. (Grade B) Retailers' compliance items: (1) Allocated sugar is only allowed to be used for processing food and is not allowed to be resold in its original form; (2) The daily inventory and sales volume should be reported truthfully. Violations of the above items will be subject to the following penalties: (1) Suspension of allocation for one month or more; (2) Requesting the police authorities to ban them in accordance with the law; (3) Cancellation of registration. As for the seven districts of retailers, the first district has 82 Grade A stores and 56 Grade B stores; the second district has 110 Grade A stores and 70 Grade B stores; the third district has 44 Grade A stores and 39 Grade B stores; the fourth district has 193 Grade A stores and 113 Grade B stores; the fifth district has 125 Grade A stores and 55 Grade B stores; the sixth district has 61 Grade A stores and 44 Grade B stores; the seventh district has 58 Grade A stores and 59 Grade B stores, totaling 1,109 Grade A and Grade B stores.</p>
<p>At that time, the amount of sugar participating in the public sale totaled 497,546 pieces, including 337,044 pieces of granulated sugar, 43,518 pieces of refined white sugar, 83,948 pieces of brown sugar, 9,900 pieces of raw sugar, 19,133 pieces of dark brown sugar, and 4,000 pieces of rock sugar. The sugar purchased by the Cooperative Office totaled 23,762 pieces and was allocated monthly to Grade A and Grade B retailers according to market needs. By the end of July of last year, the Cooperative Office had 269,345 pieces of sugar in stock. Subsequently, the military allocation authorities ordered a large amount of sugar, shipped from Taiwan in batches to Shanghai, and purchased sugar from the Philippines and acquired sugar stocks in Hong Kong, so the total amount of sugar in stock in Shanghai should be above 300,000 pieces. At the same time, considering that refined white sugar, rock sugar, and dark brown sugar are essential sugar products for Chinese people, which were originally shipped to Shanghai from Java, Hong Kong, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, but are now in short supply and have no source, in order to regulate the people's food, various raw sugar materials such as granulated sugar, raw sugar, "Dong Wu" dark brown sugar, and "Qing Wan" dark brown sugar are issued to Zhen Ji, Jian Hua, Da Cheng, Da Hua, Yi He, Xin Hua, He Ji, Jin Xin, and other factories according to their needs for processing, so as to be allocated to the Grade A retailers for sale in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the allocation of sugar to Grade A and Grade B retailers, it is stipulated that retailers should accurately budget their monthly needs for various types of sugar and submit an application to the Cooperative Office each month. After review and approval, a purchase certificate will be issued before they can purchase from the sugar firms. The period for retailers to apply is from the 23rd to the 25th of each month, and the delivery date for sugar firms to sell sugar to retailers is from the 5th to the 20th of each month. Retailers should pay a cash deposit. As for the retail sales method for Grade A retailers, initially consumers were free to purchase, with a limit on the amount that could be purchased per person each time. Later, due to the illegal activities of those who resold for profit and the "sugar squeezing" gangs, it was difficult to maintain order. Therefore, the Cooperative Office tried to improve the system repeatedly, and finally decided to sell based on housing tickets. Although the situation of queuing and "sugar squeezing" has been eliminated, the disputes over sugar distribution among general sub-tenants and landlords are unavoidable. Therefore, with the approval of the military allocation authorities, a new system of sugar allocation based on population was implemented. It was decided that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council would be entrusted to issue sugar purchase certificates in the International Settlement (including Hongkou) and the French Concession, while the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative would be responsible for setting the selling price of allocated sugar and other matters. As for the allocation of sugar based on population in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai, the Cooperative Office would handle it independently. Grade A retailers throughout the city are being re-registered and merged in order to centralize sugar sales.</p>
<p>The three most important issues of the implementation date, quantity, and price of sugar allocation based on population were discussed by the Sugar Trade Cooperative, the military allocation authorities, the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and other relevant parties. (1) The implementation date is approved to start in March, with the first sugar purchase date being March 11; (2) The quantity of sugar allocated based on population will depend on the total amount and needs approved monthly by the military allocation authorities. It is heard that the quantity for Chinese people in March is 8 ounces; (3) The price of sugar has been approved and will be re-determined and announced by the Sugar Trade Cooperative. It is heard that after the implementation of sugar allocation based on population, the black market for sugar will inevitably disappear, which is truly a blessing for the citizens.</p>
<h3>Concentrating Finances to Revive the Rural Economy - Wah Hsing Commercial Bank</h3>
<p>The Wah Hsing Commercial Savings Bank held its fourth shareholders' general meeting the day before yesterday (the 26th). Attendees included all shareholders, Chairman Liang Hongzhi, Vice Chairman Washio, and members of the board of directors and supervisors. All proposals were approved as originally presented after deliberation. The bank was founded on May 1, 1939, with a capital of 50 million yuan. Since its establishment, its business has been exceptionally prosperous. Its daily operations focus on regulating finance and developing industries. After the old currency was banned from circulation last June, the bank cooperated in expanding the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes. It maintained the value of Central Reserve Bank notes, worked hard to purchase materials, and provided loans to revive the rural economy, achieving remarkable results. Even in terms of deposits and loans alone, there has been considerable progress. The main content of this year's duties focuses on expanding the circulation of finance and Central Reserve Bank notes within the group. Its branches and offices currently number eleven. It also plans to add branches and offices in Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Changshu, Changzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and other places, and plans to lend 5 million yuan to cooperatives in various places at extremely low interest rates, in line with the bank's aim of reviving the rural economy. The full text of the business report submitted by Chairman Liang Hongzhi to the shareholders' meeting is recorded below for the reference of China's economic circles.</p>
<p>Dear shareholders, at this fourth annual general meeting, I am very pleased to report on the past year's efforts in economic construction in Central China, as well as the general situation of the bank's business in the past year.</p>
<p>The economic situation in Central China in 1942 can be summed up in one sentence: eventful and difficult. During the extraordinary circumstances of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, various policies implemented under the close liaison of the Chinese and Japanese authorities were sufficient to express the character of the first year of the Greater East Asia War, and its impression was also the most profound. Namely, the handling of British and American assets in China, the use of reserve notes as the basis of currency, the implementation of price controls, and the adjustment of distribution mechanisms were all epoch-making tasks. As time passed, they gradually changed from emergency measures to permanent implementation. At the outbreak of the war, the Japanese military authorities implemented enemy property management and material handling, and the general situation must have been well known, so there is no need to repeat it. From the perspective of construction, reviewing the changes in currency, finance, and prices over the past year, I will briefly state as follows:</p>
<p>First, in terms of currency unification, the withdrawal of the old legal currency and the promotion of reserve notes as the unified currency is a major event that should be recorded in the history of China's currency system. The details will be described later. Please first briefly explain the process of the sharp decline of the old legal currency before and after the currency unification period. On February 15th last year, the occupation of Singapore gave all parties a great shock. When the Japanese army entered Burma, the so-called Burma Road for aiding Chiang was completely cut off. As a result, the instability of the old legal currency, which was a major factor in weakening the Chongqing side, became more and more profound. For a time, people were agitated, and they exchanged goods in groups. The financial market showed a semi-panic state, and general prices also tended to rise. The National Government, in view of the sharp decline of the old legal currency, tried to reduce the damage suffered by the people within the possible range. Therefore, on March 31st, the anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, it declared that the new and old legal currencies were separated from the relationship of equal value. This measure had been studied earlier, but it had to be delayed because it was not fully prepared. When the prelude to the Greater East Asia War began, especially after the Burma Road was cut off, the future of the old legal currency was unimaginable. Therefore, before the separation of the new and old legal currencies, on March 9th, the official military ticket exchange rate against reserve notes was announced to stabilize the value of reserve notes. At the end of the month, it was officially declared to be separated from the equal value. At that time, the initial exchange rate between the new and old legal currencies was set at 100 yuan of the old legal currency for 77 yuan of the reserve notes, but the trend of instability of the old legal currency was still endless despite the regulations. In May, it became apparent. From the 19th of the month, it fell more sharply. The Central Reserve Bank started to revise the exchange rate from 74 yuan on the 20th, followed by 71 yuan on the 21st, 66 yuan on the 22nd, 60 yuan on the 23rd, and 53 yuan on the 25th, gradually lowering it to adapt to the actual situation of the market. On the 26th, it fell to 50 yuan, and there was even a risk of further decline. Unexpectedly, the exchange rate of two yuan of the old legal currency to one yuan of the new legal currency was produced.</p>
<p>At that time, in order to stabilize the livelihood of the people in Central China, the Chinese and Japanese authorities decisively implemented a comprehensive exchange on the premise of prohibiting the circulation of the old legal currency. On May 27th, the Ministry of Finance declared that a comprehensive exchange would be implemented in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, at the ratio of two yuan of the old legal currency to one yuan of the reserve notes, and clearly indicated the policy that once the recovery was completed, the legal currency nature of the old legal currency would be deprived, and it would not be allowed to circulate formally. As for the specific measures, on June 1st, four decrees were promulgated: "Regulations on Reorganizing the Old Legal Currency," "Measures for the Application of the Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Currency," "Regulations on the 1942 Financial Stability Public Bonds," and "Special Accounting Measures for the 1942 Financial Stability Public Bonds." It was planned to start recovering the old legal currency within two weeks from June 8th. However, after referring to the situation in various places, the eleven cities including Nanjing and Shanghai were extended for three days, and some cities in other cleansing areas continued to exchange until the end of the month, resulting in unexpected results and completing the comprehensive exchange.</p>
<p>After July, the recovery area was expanded from Central China to South China. On July 10th, the same measures were taken in Guangdong and Xiamen, and on August 10th in the Wuhan area. On the one hand, the National Government's currency unification was progressing steadily, and the currency war with Chongqing was further developed. The expansion of the circulation range of reserve notes and the increase in the amount of issuance became more and more significant. In order to enrich the issuance reserve, with the assistance of the Japanese government, the Central Reserve Bank and the Bank of Japan signed a 100 million yuan loan agreement on July 28th, making the Central Reserve Bank more solid and developed.</p>
<p>More than half a year has passed since the old legal currency began to be recovered. During this period, the circulation area of reserve notes has been expanded to the above-mentioned extensive areas. At the same time, from June 25th, the use of old legal currency was prohibited in Nanjing and Shanghai. The Jiangsu Province Qingxiang area, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, and the first Qingxiang area in southeastern Taihu Lake were also decisively prohibited from using and carrying it in turn. The same measures were also taken in Xiamen City and Wuhan area of Guangdong Province. However, due to special circumstances in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, comprehensive prohibition of circulation could not be achieved. Therefore, from December 1st, the three provinces and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai not only absolutely prohibited the use and carrying of old legal currency, but also prohibited its preservation and possession. Therefore, from November 1st to 30th, strict exchange was carried out in the area again. At this point, the currency unification in Central China can be said to have reached the final stage. The old legal currency has lost its so-called currency function, and the unification of reserve notes has been realized.</p>
<p>Complementary to the efforts of currency unification is the financial control of the National Government, which has made extraordinary progress in the past year. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American banking groups, including HSBC, absolutely dominated the local financial community. At the same time, the Chongqing government banking system under their protection also possessed considerable power. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank's control over the financial community could not be immediately strengthened. However, with the outbreak of this war, the British, American, and Chongqing banking systems were confiscated by the Japanese military authorities. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank became the only issuing bank in Central China, and its control over the financial community also progressed rapidly. On August 21st, the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions," and on September 18th, it promulgated the detailed rules for the implementation of the measures, stipulating the licensing system for the establishment of financial institutions such as banks and money shops, making the power to request the submission of business reports legalized, and ordering general Chinese commercial banks to deposit deposit reserve funds into the Central Reserve Bank. The financial control of the Central Reserve Bank became more powerful, and in essence, it already possessed the qualifications of a central bank. On the other hand, among the four Chongqing banking systems confiscated by the Japanese authorities, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, after September 1st, swept away the Chongqing color and operated under the banner of the Central Reserve Bank, which was well received by all parties. In addition, the Joint Reserve Committee, the financial adjustment mechanism of Chinese commercial banks, also adapted to the current situation, reorganized its internal structure, and expressed its cooperation with the National Government to carry out adjustments. In addition, the Shanghai Foreign Banks Association also followed suit to eliminate the British and American color, and restarted with Japanese banks as the center.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the implementation of price controls, the "Provisional Measures for Stabilizing Prices" promulgated on May 29th were implemented in conjunction with the previous currency unification policy, and gradually became more active. Subsequently, on July 3rd, the "Provisional Regulations on Stabilizing Prices" and the "Provisional Regulations on Combating Private Price Hikes" were promulgated separately. The crux of the price policy in the past, that is, the speculative behavior of using financial institutions, can be completely eradicated. Since September 1st, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have been carrying out comprehensive price countermeasures under close liaison, starting with general retail prices, with the prices at the end of May as the standard, prohibiting them from exceeding the limit. This kind of restriction on retail prices is a temporary emergency measure. Therefore, the parties concerned are fully considering fundamental countermeasures, including the consistent price control from raw material purchase to product distribution, the establishment of purchase and distribution mechanisms, and the adjustment of needs. However, due to the shortage of materials, the practice of hoarding goods and speculating has not been curbed. After mid-October, the rising trend of major foods such as sugar and oil, and cotton yarn and cotton cloth cannot be ignored. On November 19th, the authorities formulated the highest wholesale prices for cotton yarn and cotton city, the largest industrial products in Central China, which will be implemented from December 1st. In the past, price controls only focused on the consumer part, but this time it also covers the wholesale part, which can be considered to have great significance and can show the future trend of price controls.</p>
<p>In short, from the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to the occupation of Singapore and the pacification of Burma, this period was a period for the rapid implementation of various emergency countermeasures on the economy of Central China. If we assume that this is the first phase, then the second phase from the separation of the new and old legal currencies to the end of November last year is the period for the recovery of the old legal currency and the implementation of construction plans in various aspects. The third phase after December began with the comprehensive prohibition of the old legal currency in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Since the chairman's visit to Japan, it can be seen that it has jumped from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. Under the above-mentioned environment, the bank's business situation in the past year has gradually become more solid and developed. The separation of the new and old legal currencies, followed by comprehensive exchange, and the reserve notes advanced to a unified currency. During this extremely historical period of change, the bank's increase in deposits and loans was not hindered by this. Compared with the same period last year, it is more than enough, which is truly commendable and gratifying. Now, reviewing the year-end balance of various deposits and loans, the total deposits were 270,191,000 yuan at the end of June and 320,552,000 yuan at the end of December. The loans were 202,322,000 yuan at the end of June and 261,463,000 yuan at the end of December. The net profit for the first half of the year was 1,400,000 yuan, and the net profit for the second half of the year was 1,835,000 yuan, totaling 3,235,000 yuan. The net profit for the previous year was 3,259,000 yuan (old legal currency standard). Although it seems to be slightly reduced when viewed as a reserve note standard, this is actually due to the suspension of foreign exchange, but it can still achieve the above-mentioned results, which can prove the increase in deposits and loans. Since the implementation of the foreign currency fund freeze order, the bank has focused on domestic finance as its business center and has been engaged in increasing the number of inland branches and offices. The implementation has come to an end. Last year, new offices were established in Nantong, Jiaxing, and Yangzhou. In January this year, the head office moved to the Gongrong Building (formerly the location of the Bank of Goodwill), and the Hongkou branch was established at the old site. Currently, in addition to the head office, there are a total of eleven branches and offices.</p>
<p>In January last year, two departments of savings and trust were added. The main purpose is to serve as a fund supply department for the bank department and to make side efforts. It also operates agency insurance, safekeeping for customers, sales of bonds, management of real estate, and various loans. With a special position, it has achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Recently, our friendly country Japan established the Greater East Asia Province. At the same time, Mr. Okazaki Kaheita, the executive director of the bank, resigned due to his appointment as a counselor of the Greater East Asia Province. In addition to bidding farewell, we deeply remember that Mr. Okazaki has made outstanding contributions since the establishment of the bank and is an indispensable person for the bank. Only because of the Japanese authorities' earnest hope, he had to enter the official career. This matter was reported to the last shareholders' extraordinary meeting, but I am still reluctant to this day.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is that the National Government has announced its participation in the war on January 9th. Due to this participation, the relationship between China and Japan has advanced from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. It should be known that the Greater East Asia War is not only Japan's war against Britain and the United States, but also the uprising of all oppressed nations in East Asia. In this new situation, a new prelude will be launched in economic policy, which can be reversed.</p>
<p>China's materials for construction have been largely imported from Japan in the past. In the future, it cannot rely solely on Japan, but must strive for self-sufficiency. Furthermore, China should mobilize all its resources and production to fight against Britain and the United States, and advance towards the completion of the war with close cooperation with friendly countries. Therefore, expanding productivity is the first priority. If we think of the great war of attrition currently unfolding in the southern waters, then the need for full cooperation between China and Japan is more urgent than ever. We firmly believe that now is the time for the two countries to work together to defeat Britain and the United States. Liang Hongzhi, Chairman of Wah Hsing Commercial Bank (February 26, 1943)</p>

<h3>Enjoying One's Profession</h3>
<p>— Fei Hui</p>
<p>In this era, the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. Although there are many reasons for this, such as the depression of society or the decline of personnel, a large number of people are becoming unemployed. However, there is another important reason, that is, employed people often cannot enjoy their profession. No matter what a person does, if he is not interested in it, how can it succeed? Therefore, if an employed worker complains all day long, his work efficiency will be relatively reduced, and the impression he gives to others will also be bad. This is not being able to enjoy one's profession.</p>
<p>In fact, no matter what kind of profession, after careful appreciation, it contains great fun. The real fun is often buried in the center of difficulties, waiting to be excavated hard, and finally it will definitely be obtained. Therefore, employed people should take enjoying their profession as the basis and use patient hard work to overcome the general bad environment.</p>
<p>However, it is indeed too difficult for an employee who lives on a low salary to maintain his life. This will also make him feel that the work he is doing is boring. This requires mutual understanding. Employers should also try their best to reduce the pain of employees, so as not to make them have the mentality of "complaining about every line of work" and reduce work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Torment, Expectation, and Effort</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>Many people feel tormented in life. They eagerly expect the coming of light, but light is not obtained from imagination. It must be obtained from effort. So without torment, there is no expectation. Therefore, torment is the motivation for expectation, and expectation? More importantly, there must be effort to make torment have a way out.</p>
<p>Many people say this: "Expectation is not the way out of torment. It is just a phenomenon of torment!" I think this sentence is very right. If you don't work hard in expectation, what's the use of expectation? So we must not hold the slogan of "relying on heaven for food." We cannot believe in the control of fate. We should remember the old saying "Heroes create the times." It is useless to rely on expectation and hope in torment. What is more important is effort.</p>
<p>We have read great biographies, and it seems that they have achieved success from torment, expectation, and effort. The reason for success is "having great ambitions from a young age." In fact, "great ambitions" are not valuable. What is valuable is personal effort. The failure of ordinary people is that they have torment and expectation, but no effort. So ordinary people are ambitious, but their lives are decadent and depressed. Although there is expectation, it is just a spring dream.</p>
<p>Friends! We should not fantasize about hope coming. We should carry the burden and walk forward. Although it is torment, can the beautiful scenery in expectation be achieved without effort? So we must work hard before we can succeed. We should not just talk about torment. We should not just expect. We must work hard to prepare. We must "carry the burden." This is the way out of torment!</p>
<h3>Vine and Zhang</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xushang</p>
<p>The yard paved with stones is full of messy green grass. In order to make it neat and beautiful, it took a whole day to completely clean them up. At that time, although I was exhausted, I was happy to have completed a wish. But after a few days, they poked their heads in the stone cracks again. In a fit of anger, I took a small knife and iron shovel to dig them up one by one, even with the soil. But after a few days, they returned to their original state. After several attempts, I was unable to stop their vitality. At this time, I realized that human power cannot destroy the vitality of nature, just as evil forces cannot stop the angry tide of justice. The indomitable growth of green grass is more than ten thousand times better than those vines that cannot stand on their own without parasitism.</p>
<p>If we roughly distinguish the current human beings, we can also divide them into two categories: "grass-like people" and "vine-like people." The former rely on their own struggle to stand in society. The latter rely on inheritance or parasitize on exploitation and speculation. They often eat, prostitute, gamble, and enjoy themselves outside the labor line, regardless of whether their actions are harmful to the country and society. However, the high tower on the floating sand will collapse sooner or later. In the near future, there may be a storm to break their parasitic pillars." (End of quotation)</p>
<h3>Watching Li Yanxiu and Ji Yuliang's Opera</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring this year and before the Lantern Festival, a total of half a month, I have not been to the opera house that performs Peking Opera. I have my reasons. Peking Opera has always been accustomed to performing two operas every night from the lunar calendar's New Year's Day. This year, a new emerging style has been added. The leading actors often perform a heavy opera, singing four operas day and night. Even people made of iron and copper will be tired, let alone flesh and blood? How can they not be tired to death? If we want to listen to opera, we naturally want to listen to good operas with concentration. Watching such teeth-grinding, dull operas does not feel comfortable, so there is no need to go. Besides, the people who watch operas in the New Year are another group of people, supporting the old and carrying the young, and the types are very mixed. There are very few connoisseurs among them, and it is more noisy than usual, and the ears are not clean.</p>
<p>February 19th happened to be the Lantern Festival of the year Guiwei. This is very strange. I did not see fireworks, but I saw heavy snow falling. I thought today was the time to listen to opera. So I braved the wind and snow to the Queen's Theater. Ji Yuliang and Li Yanxiu both had two operas. Ji's "Fire Bull Array" is "Golden Terrace." These two opera names are very far from the topic. - I didn't see them. Li Yanxiu's "Great Splitting of the Coffin" was performing mourning and matchmaking. The old "Four Geng" "250" and Xiao Shoushan's apprentice "Chunyun" were teasing each other. Both little clowns were good. In this scene, when Tian sees that Prince Chu is handsome, she asks him about his height and wants to marry him. The words of the two people's questions and answers are conveyed by "Chunyun" and "250." All the laughter belongs to the two little clowns. Tian and Prince Chu don't have any acting to do. Tian's acting is shown when she is working and her martial arts skills are revealed when she is digging the coffin. When I saw Li Yanxiu performing at the Updating Stage two years ago, I saw that her face and body were full of fat, and she was so fat that it was scary. The impression was not good, so I didn't pay much attention to how she was acting. Today, when I saw her dressed as Tian, her body has become much thinner, and the "patches" on her face are well done, and she doesn't look very fat. I looked at her carefully and saw that she had a pair of good eyes, long and big, and her eyes were dark. Sometimes her right eye squinted, making a look of charm. This is what I had not seen two years ago. If I don't look carefully today, I will have wronged her for this pair of good eyes. Below, "250" used a fan to flutter a pair of butterflies. Cao Sigeng did a very good job. His head and upper body were completely still, like a real paper figure. This scene is a "small material" - gimmick - added by the Bangzi Opera troupe earlier - and the role of Zou's chasing two male and female rats in "Fighting Wancheng" is the same, all are made up out of thin air and are digressions. However, Zhuang Zhou's transformation into a butterfly is a saying in ancient books, so it is not adding feet to a snake. But there is another meaning. The audience must know that the pair of flying butterflies symbolizes the mutual love of men and women. Only Zhuang Zhou, who is detached from the world, can lie in the coffin board and not move, can he avoid the trouble of "human desire." Li Yanxiu's Tian has a lot of explanation for sharpening the axe before splitting the coffin, which is much stronger than all the female actors who have played Tian in recent times. When she got on the table and split open the coffin and saw Zhuang Zhou suddenly resurrected and stood up, she should have chosen a somersault as usual. Yanxiu did not fall, I am afraid she was lazy. When Zhuangzi asked him this question, she rolled on the ground with her feet facing the sky. The name is "Double Dragons Twisting the Pillars." This hand is also a customary thing. However, when the female actors play this set, they are wearing short clothes and binding fake little feet. Others see it in their eyes, and they have a feeling of beauty and charm. No one will dislike it. After this opera, Tian committed suicide with an axe. Below, Ji Yuliang came with another opera, "Slashing the Yellow Robe." Liu Hongsheng is the best at singing this opera because the tune is high, the voice is round, and the opening "Gaga tune" is like firing anti-aircraft guns. Every bullet hits the skyscraper, loud and crisp. As for turning high, it is even more common. The local scenery is effortless and naturally wonderful, so he is famous for singing this high-pitched opera. Ji Yuliang's voice was pretty good in Golden last year. This year, I heard people say that his voice was broken. I didn't quite believe it. Today, I listened to him sing "Slashing the Yellow Robe," and his voice was indeed not good. The tune was not enough "six and a half tunes." It was not the tune of "Slashing the Yellow Robe" at all. The tune he sang was obviously coping. When he "looked at the details," the word "details" usually made a Gaga tune, but Yuliang made it, but the high point was not enough, and it was not wide enough. "Unbuttoning the robe" is another Liu-style tune, and Yuliang would not use it. Listening to this "Slashing the Yellow Robe," Yuliang was always perfunctory, with no highlights at all. His voice was empty, a tune lower than in the Golden Age. Did something go wrong? If he doesn't hurry up and kill a bloody path, I will worry about his future! Below, Li Yanxiu performed another opera, "Liang Hongyu Drums and Fights Jinshan." This is a martial arts opera. Yanxiu plays Han Shizhong's wife Liang, singing the Northern tune, revealing the "handle" and "bright image," which can also be seen, but it cannot be considered the most sophisticated opera, so there is no need to comment on it in detail.</p>
<h3>Life's Task</h3>
<p>— Shi Han</p>
<p>Time is life's fair critic. It is an instrument for measuring the meaning of life. When you have completed a segment of life's journey, it will use the length of time consumed to measure the extent of your achievements, and then make a fair and selfless judgment on the meaning of your true life. Even if you are a world-renowned sophist, you cannot possibly place a beak over its judgment to stubbornly defend it.</p>
<p>The task of life is how to maintain an equal value, or even exceed it, under the measurement of time. To put it plainly, it means that in every stage of life, one must complete or exceed the subjects one deserves in order to keep the meaning of one's life in balance with time on the scales, or to make the side with time placed on it tilt upwards!</p>
<h3>Association. Fantasy. Ideal</h3>
<p>— Zhong Shun</p>
<p>According to the explanation of psychology, association is a series of thoughts. When we experience things we have experienced before, we often bring out another thing related to that experience. As Chesterton said, "The brain becomes a wreck or a flea market." Gradually displayed. Therefore, association is really a sequential reproduction of past experiences.</p>
<p>Fantasy is different. Its biggest difference from association is a psychology of hoping for the future. The so-called "daydreaming" and "fanciful thinking" belong to it, and are usually called dreaming. This fantasy, in the process of thought departure, has no basis, but a kind of delusional self-psychological satisfaction, and the result of failure will occupy his whole life.</p>
<p>As for the ideal, his thoughts are based on something, progressing in order, and according to the law of the same cause produces the same effect, the "probability" of achieving the goal is very high. If there is no so-called "accidental" thing to hinder it, after some effort, it may be possible to achieve the wish. Therefore, his idea is definitely not a repeat of past experiences, nor is it like a fantasy without any basis, with mixed levels. Therefore, this kind of idea can be called an ideal. That is the so-called "Utopia" like Confucius's "Great Harmony".</p>
<p>As for the relationship between association, fantasy, and ideal. The three are each a part of thought. And here, the scope of association involves the past and focuses on the past; fantasy and ideal both focus on the future. To use people as an analogy, association is close to an old man familiar with anecdotes, fantasy is like an emotional youth, and ideal is also a youth, but he has rationality.</p>
<h3>Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(18)</p>
<p>He liked someone suggesting the idea. He felt too weak to bother conjecturing how it had happened—how they had got him upstairs, what Mrs. Wickett had said, and all the rest. But suddenly, there, by his bed, was Mrs. Wickett. Smiling. Ah, well, he thought, what’s she doing here? And in the shadow behind Mrs. Wickett he saw Cartwright, the new headmaster (though he’d been at Brookfield since nineteen-nineteen, he thought of him still as “new”), and old Buffles, commonly called “Roddy.” Queer, they were all here. He thought: I needn’t bother thinking anything more whatever. I’m going to sleep.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t sleep, and it wasn’t quite waking: it was a sort of in-between state, full of dreams, and faces, and sounds. Old scenes and scraps of tunes: that Mozart trio that Caldy used to play—cheers, laughter, and the sound of guns—and over it all, Brookfield’s bells, Brookfield’s bells. “So you see, if Præbus refuses to take Miss Betrishian, remember, you can, you cad. . . .” Jokes: rotten beef . . . jokes . . . You there, Max? Yes, come in. Any news from home? . . . O Miki Praeteritos . . . Ralston said I was slack and inefficient—but they couldn’t have managed without me. . . . Obile herec ago fotibus es in aro . . . Who can construe me that? . . . It’s a joke. . . .</p>
<p>Once, he heard them talking about him in the room.</p>
<p>Cartwright was whispering to Murifr. “Poor old chap—must have been rather lonely all these years.”</p>
<p>Murifr replied, “Not altogether lonely. You know, he was married.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? I never heard that.” “She died. It must be—oh, fully thirty years ago. More, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Poor chap. Pity he never had any children.”</p>
<p>Chips, hearing this, made a desperate effort to open his eyes wider and so attract their attention. It was hard to speak aloud, but he wanted to say something, something that would tell them. He gazed round the room, and then at each of them in turn.</p>
<p>He struggled, and said slowly, “You were saying—I rather thought—some one was—um—saying. . . .” (49)</p>

<h3>Promoting Group Weddings</h3>
<p>— Ye Bincan</p>
<p>Marriage is the source of kinship and the cause of social organization. In the past, our country paid great attention to the form of marriage, and the rituals and etiquette were particularly complicated, such as the six rites of Zhou: Nà Cǎi, Wèn Míng, Nà Jí, Qǐng Qī, Nà Zhēng, and Qīn Yíng. Descending to later generations, the rituals gradually became simpler, and in Zhu Zi's Family Rituals, only the three rites of Nà Cǎi, Nà Zhēng, and Qīn Yíng remained. In modern times, customs have been followed, but they have not yet escaped the old form. However, in today's world of turmoil and people's livelihood difficulties, extravagance and waste are really unnecessary. If individual weddings are changed to group weddings, it can save a lot of money economically. For example, the hall needs to be borrowed separately, which costs a lot. If we cooperate, we can adopt a public hall system, and the bridesmaids can also adopt a joint system. Bands and all equipment can be shared. Therefore, group weddings are more economical than individual weddings in any aspect. Especially when many newlyweds gather together, the joy is naturally more pleasant in spirit. For example, the Dalae Group Wedding Service held a group wedding ceremony at the Xianle Dance Palace a few days ago, with Mr. Chen Yisheng as the officiant. The order was well-organized, and the ceremony was simple but solemn. Mr. Huang Jingwan sent congratulatory couplets: "Good couples must start from respecting and loving each other, and good families must come from diligence and thrift," which was particularly interesting. In this time of difficult material resources, this system can be promoted. Marriage only needs to comply with the requirements of the current Civil Code on Family Law that "marriage should have a public ceremony and two or more witnesses" to be legal. I hope that young men and women in society will be cautious when choosing a spouse in the future, and strive for simplicity in the form of marriage. Group weddings are an economical, generous, and legal marriage system, and should be advocated.</p>
