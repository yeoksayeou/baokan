<p>社評</p>
<h3>東綫第三年與「西綫」問題</h3>
<p>歷史上空前未有的大規模的東綫戰爭—德蘇戰爭，已經進入第三年了。誠如日本朝日新聞六月廿四日社評指出，德蘇戰爭兩軍的最大敎訓，是反駁了開戰當初一部份戰略論者的所謂德蘇「短期戰」之謬誤，是充分暴露了長期戰的性格。因此，我們要判斷德蘇戰爭的情况，及其前途，必須站立在這一嚴肅的事實上面，才不致得出謬誤的結論來。</p>
<p>東綫進入作戰第三年，恰是在意外的靜寂了三個多月的時候，這又說明了什麽呢？一般的說，過去兩年，天時對於東綫，曾發生了重大的作用。每當陽春以後，德軍即開始大規模的攻勢戰爭，而當嚴寒季節開始之時，就給蘇聯以反攻的機會。但是，在今日，當春季已暮，夏季開始的今日也就是應該是德軍展開大攻勢的今日，爲什麽東綫的戰爭，還只表現在古斑地區及庫爾斯克，奧萊爾等地局部性的戰鬥，和空軍的攻防戰之活躍，而未見德軍展開大攻勢呢？是不是說，德軍在今夏已不準備或不可能展開這種大攻勢呢？我們要指出，這些問題，在最嚴肅與正確的觀察者，必須從全面來觀察的。我們首先，是不是可以提出這樣的問題，即當德軍未曾展開大攻勢之時，爲什麽蘇聯不爭取主動而向德軍採取進一步的反攻呢？我們要首先解答這個問題以後，才能進而估計德國的攻勢以至整個戰局發展的趨勢。</p>
<p>蘇聯之不能在夏季爭取主動發展反攻，不是要不要的問題。而是能不能的問題。首先，在過去兩年間，蘇軍的損失是驚人的慘重的。據德方的報告，蘇方人力的損失（包括重傷俘虜）不下二千萬名。而就按蘇聯力面自已承認的，「死亡及失踪的」也有四百二十萬名，並且還損失了各種口徑的大砲三萬五千尊，坦克三萬輛，飛機二萬二千架，這些數字，當然實際上已經大打折扣，然而，也可說是「損失慘重」了。因此，蘇聯在人的資源，經濟生產力，以至一般經濟生產力方面，遭遇到重大的困難。也因此，要發動一次接續冬季之後的大反攻，除了紙上的空談以外，絕對不是輕易的事。結果可能完全動搖其國本。蘇聯能這樣幹嗎？其决，無論羅斯福與邱吉爾的演說詞與電文是怎樣的漂亮唐皇，無論英美各方面的期待和主觀要求如是，關於「第二戰綫」即是「西綫」，始終沒有實現。這裏，最主要的原因，與其謂爲英美對蘇政治上的矛盾之嚴重。其實還不如說英美本身的困難，在英美內部，存在着國內戰綫，在英國，有着保守黨與左翼各黨，以及工黨和共黨的矛盾，在美國如勞工總同盟更無異爲美國國內的敵國，近來煤礦罷工事件之波濤迭起，更直接阻礙和破壞美國的軍需工業，以至牽制了反軸心國開闢西綫的戰略行動。此外，黑人問題，中南美的各國問題，都在這千鈞一髮的時候，在這英美企圖攻歐的時候，與東方的印度革命運動同樣的活躍起來，向美英算帳了。因此，所謂第二戰綫，依舊只是一句口號。然而這一事實，對於蘇聯，是最沉重的打擊，蘇聯情報局自已也在戰爭二週年紀念日明言：「放過一九四三年在歐洲開闢第二戰綫的有利機會，遲延這項行動，那就是使我們的共同事業受到嚴重的損害。延遲在歐洲開闢第二戰綫，結果會使戰爭拖延，那就是大大地增加犧牲」。以上兩點，可以充分說明爲什麽蘇聯不能展開反攻了。</p>
<p>蘇聯不能反攻，同時「西綫」也不會一下子出現，是不是就應該說德國可以發展攻勢呢？只要不是只重皮毛的觀察，決不會有這個結論的。因爲，第一，有如六月廿四日日本朝日新聞所指出的，蘇聯雖然在人的資源，軍需生產力和一般經濟力上遭遇到困難，但是，由於土地廣大之利，生產力之再編成，是一向在努力着的；可見蘇聯的戰鬥力及其强靱的政治力尙未可深侮。第二「西綫」雖然一時未必就能開闢或開展，但主要的原因是英美國內問題之阻礙，而近來英國之以華維爾任印度總督，以及內閣改組的宣傳，共黨與工黨合併運動之繼續活躍，美國關於勞動戰綫之工作等等，雖然不會有什麽重要的收穫，但是也可見英美對於國內戰綫之準備了。因此，英美之冒險的可能性依然存在着的。德國在這時候如果出之輕率，對於長期戰中的今後地位，自很難說，所以，德國面臨夏季攻勢的愼重態度，無寧說是獅子的沉默，朝日新聞柏林特派員守山氏於六月十丸日發出的通訉，特別報道德國對蘇作戰方略的轉變，「從政治力與軍事力二方面，在對蘇作戰上，尋求新的解決方法。」守山氏特別指出德方對於日本所採南方佔領地諸對策的非常關心研究，對東條首相的菲島獨立宣言，深致讚嘆。他說明德國對蘇戰略方針之演變「第一年在殲滅紅軍野戰軍主力，第二年在佔領蘇聯的土地資源，第二年度，其特徵在發動政治力。」（譯文見二十四日本報第三版）可視爲德國針對上述事實而採取的重要的新方針。</p>
<p>政治力與軍事力配合的對蘇戰略新方針，自然並不是說德國不會展開束綫大攻勢，而只是說依據更愼重曳萬全的計劃而作更有力的展開，同時還包含着對英美可能冒險戰略的打擊在內。我們深信，目前德國的愼重，正是未來勝利的因素。而這種勝利的保證，就是德國後方生產力及一般經濟力之保持與軍需生產之邁進，（參閱廿三，廿四日本報「德國戰時企業的恣態」，）我們可以明白的說，東綫的沉寂不會太久，而西綫的喧囂仍將是無力的暄囂而已。</p>

<h3>周財長石渡經濟顧問　昨日由京飛抵漢口　商討武漢地區財政問題</h3>
<p>漢口二十八日中央社電　國民政府財政部長　佛海氏及國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郎氏，爲商討武漢地區之財政問題，於二十八日　午〇時二十分飛抵此間。</p>
<p>漢口二十八日中央社電　國府財政部長周佛海氏爲視察湘鄂贛三省財政現况，特偕同黃參事，薛司長，熊委員，馬處長等於二十八日晨由京搭專機飛漢，國府經濟最高顧問石渡莊太郎氏亦同來，於當日中午十二時二十分安抵此間機塲，到機塲歡迎者中國方面有楊省長，張市長，財部王特派員，中儲分行洪經理，黃協理等暨省市政府各廳處局長及各機關體代表等，友邦方面落合部長，冲野海軍武官，田顧問等。周財長下機後，即與歡迎者一一行禮略事寒暄後，旋卽乘坐專車駛抵旅邸休息。午後王特派員洪經理假怡和村招待所設宴爲周財長等洗塵，由省市長官等作陪，席間觥籌交錯，極爲融洽，至二時許賓主盡歡而散。</p>
<p>周財長發表談話</p>
<p>漢口二十八日中央社電　國府財政部長兼中央儲備銀行總裁周佛海氏，於二十八日正午十二時二十分由京搭機蒞漢，略事休息後，即行分訪友邦日本駐漢軍政當局，下午五時並假五花賓館招待武漢中日新聞記者發表談話。七時出席省政府楊省長招待宴，由省府各廳處局長作陪，席間觥籌交錯，直至九時許始盡歡而散。茲將談話原文錄後：本人於民國二十九年國民政府還都後，曾來武漢一次，至今已三年矣。此三年中常欲前來武漢視祭，均因事忙未克分身，此次重來，見武漢治安政治經濟及靑年訓練各方面均有飛躍的進步，衷心至爲欣慰。友邦之協助，省市政府同人之努力，以及民衆之後援，均有不容漠視之成績，本人能有此機會代表中央向友邦及吾國官民深表謝忱，實屬愉快，尤其對於中央財政方針及金融政策之推行，友邦及省市當局予以　大之協力，本人更不能不表謝意者也。中國自對英美宣戰以來，已與友邦日本由同甘共苦之關係，進面同生共死，故吾國應如何與友邦協力，以必死之決心，求必生之結果，實爲吾國官民應日夜苦心焦思以謀改進者也，協力之途經緯萬端，吾人自應由各方面努力，但最要者則爲强化財政與金融之力量。</p>
<p>國民政府三年以來，均本健全財政政策，財政基礎賴以確立。目前政府之支出，較之還都當時已增加七倍以上，但至今未發一紙公債，亦未向中儲透支一文，財政之健全於此可見。但中國參戰以後，因參戰而必需舉辦之事業甚多，例如擴充軍備，確立治安，以及發展產業，此類事業在在需款，故今後之中心工作，爲如何增加稅收，以適應戰時財政之需要，而加强戰力，關於此點，中央已研究縝密計劃，以期逐漸實施，武漢國稅之整理，亦自在該項計劃之中。國府還都後，本人曾來武漢一次，爲適應當時之需要，組織湘鄂贛臨時財政整理委員會，三年以來因委員會之努力，及友邦之協助，武漢財政巳上軌道，整理委員會听應負之使命，已經完成。今値新時代開始之時，不能不有新機構以適應之，故將臨時組織之整委會結束，改爲正常之財政特派員公署。今後如何能使稅收增加，如何能使人民負担平均，以及關係中央與地方之財政如何能兼籌並顧，均須賴該公署之籌劃與實施，甚盼省市長官及友邦當局繼讀予以協力，俾得完成使命，進而强化國民政府戰時之財政政策也。</p>
<p>中央儲備銀行刻巳成爲名實俱符之國家銀行，其所發行之儲備　，亦已成爲華中華南之唯一通貨，過去關係推行儲備券，深得省市長及友邦當局之協力，本人於此重申謝意。今後之任務在如何使金融安定，而遂其健全發展關係。戰時金融政策，已由全國經濟委員會詳細規定，正由吾人逐漸實施，其最要者爲納金融於正軌，務使資金投於生產事業，而勿濫用於投機。政府爲此特設金融檢查事務處，以指導而監督之責，二十日已於武漢成立分處，甚盼因該分處之成立，更能使武漢金融得健全發展，及武漢產業之復興焉。</p>
<h3>周副院長　忠告中日兩國國民　就中日關係新發展略抒觀感</h3>
<p>南京廿八日中央社電　中國國民政府行政院副院長兼財政部長周佛海氏頃以時局雜觀爲題，就中日關係之新發展，略抒觀感，茲錄大意如次：中國對英美宣戰以後，中日兩國關係，已益臻緊密，尤以主席表明與日本同生共死之決心後，日本亦起而呼應，發表聲明，積極準備撤廢治外法權，與交還租界，並將經濟統制事務，移歸中國方面，又將一部份美英敵產，移交吾國管理。此次日東條首相，又曾在議會聲明準備改訂中日間原有條約，故日本之尊重中國獨立自主，使中國獲得國際上平等自由之地位，此種方針，已在現實上項聲明。以前中國人中，不乏懷疑日本之誠意者，但從現實之事態而觀，則應絕對的信任日政府之誠意。余對于東條首相之達大眼光，爲東亞百年大計着想，而樹立鞏固之基礎，實有無限敬意。當此重大時期，中日兩國國民，均須抱準確之認識，予以支持與信賴，若素乏認識，則將引起不幸之結果。中國必須認識日本此次實踐新政策，係完全出於自發的誠意，而不可誤認日本因戰事總力逐漸脆弱，乃不得不實行新政策。蓋日本在南洋獲得豐富資源之結果，其戰力已較前顯著增强，此次隨南洋開發之進展，日本之戰力將益見充實。美英企圖以持久戰署迫日本，而結果反使自身陷於苦境。在軍事方面如僅恃空中遊擊戰，亦決不能決定勝敗。美英斷難以陸軍向日本挑起決戰，不僅英美陸軍不能侵入日本本土，即對日軍之占領地，亦難以捲土重來，僅僅一二小島嶼之得失，決不能影響勝敗。日本已以此種必勝不敗之態勢與決心，而對中國實行新政策，蓋全函於尊重中國之誠意。如中國國民不能認識此種事實，茍稍作傲慢行動，則必將引起日本國民之反感，結果將使日政府難於實行新政策，甚致或將引起形勢之逆轉，而兩國友好關係有惡化之虞，故中國國民對於此點，尤須護愼將事。日本國民亦須認識此次實行新政策，旨在樹立束亞永久和平之基礎，決非　謀誘引渝方之參加和運也。日政府此次措置，完全出於誠意，而非含有謀略性質，余希望日本國民能充分瞭解此種事實，如日本國民認爲日政府實行新政策後，渝方即將發生動搖，而歸附國府，則可謂過於理。想又如日本國民間抱有此種希望者，自然對於政府之新政策，始則將起懷疑，繼又將感失望，甚致將反對新政策，日本國民應遵循政府之誠意與決心，不問渝方之參加和運與吾，而澈底協力新政策。渝方能覺悟而參加和運，固屬大佳，但如不能實現，新政策仍須不斷推進，我人深信日本徹底實行對中國新政策後，渝方之抗戰名目與理由即將完全消失，故渝方之盲目舉動，決不能持久，因此日本之實行對中國新政策，將可促起渝方之停止抗戰。但須知此僅爲若干條件中所包括之一個條件，決非唯一之條件，蓋欲達到中日間之全面和平，尙須克服若干條件，如國際情勢之推移，即其一例，日本之對中國新政策，係若干條件中最重要而最根本者，但尙不能作爲唯一之條件，換言之，即使日本實行對中國新政策仍不能期望渝方立呈動搖崩潰，而自願請求和平。但因此種期待不能實現，而遽反對新政策主張其逆轉，則又錯誤。蓋新政策如其字義所述，係政策而非謀略，現在正逢歷史之轉換時期，如認識一有錯誤，自將引起不幸之結果，故余於此僅貢獻忠吿於中日兩國國民。</p>
<h3>京市展開短髪運動　林部長率先示範　署期集訓學員一律剪短蓄髮</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　時屆夏令，衛生相當重要，戰時下之短髮運動，漸由各　層領導者展開，新運會秘書長兼中國靑年模範圍書記長林柏生氏，率先剪短菴髮，因此新運會隸屬各機關職員大多風從仿效，自動刈除長髮，留有者不過三公分左右，模範圍第一聯隊專務團員全體曁本市新聞界多人亦均以光頭姿態出現，行見風氣養成，短髮運動愈見展開。</p>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　暑期集訓公務人員暨靑少年團兩營學員，於二十八日入營，兩營對入營手續，曁接待人員，均於事前有相當籌劃，故秩序至爲良好。青少年團營並製定學員手冊，併載有論新運，政府公怖綱要，以及各種新運集訓章程規則，二十九日預定行事，爲（一）個別談話，（二）體格檢查，（三）自述速寫，（四）電影等。</p>
<p>（又訊）星期集訓營，對學員管理，採嚴格主義　鑒於戰時不之暑期訓練，有注　夏令衛生短髮運動必要，所有職員，自營長以下，均率先躬行剪短蓄髮，實踐新運，對學員亦限定不得超過三公分，女學員則剪至耳際爲度，一旦訓練開始，將不見長髮存在，隊伍行中，可精神振作云。</p>
<h3>新運會滑翔機　昨在京表演</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　新國民運動促進委員會爲謀提倡滑翔機運動，特利用友邦每日新聞社所贈送之滑翔機，舉行講習會。二十八日下午三時全體學員由鍾管理處長，宮本設計委員，率領赴城內飛機塲，首由主任指導員志鶴操縱高級滑翔機，在上空表演，高達五百餘米，並作種種特殊表演，正翻反翻鷂子，全體學員曁在塲外觀看民衆，全體鼓掌稱讚，對志鶴之神妙駕駛，莫不驚奇。按志鶴氏爲日本滑空士第一流名手，預料在廿九日舉行贈呈式時，更有一番特殊精奇之表演，表演時間爲上午十一時，並歡迎本市民衆前往參觀。</p>
<h3>建設部計劃　舉辦兩大水利工程</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電，建設部爲適應戰時經濟計劃，積極推進急要建設事業起見，經已擬製建設三年計劃，呈院核辦。聞該項計劃以開發農產水利爲重心，俾達增產以裕民生之目的，故首列開闢蘇北新運河及浚墾江南東太湖兩大水利事業，現正由關係方面計劃進行。該項事業之大概如次：（一）開關蘇北新運河，擬於該區域內開關一貫通南北之新運河，輔以支渠堤閘，使成完美之排水及灌溉茶，俾得無虞潦旱，並可全部開墾種棉。三年計劃中，擬先開闢自角斜鎭至新洋港間一段，計長一百三十公里，稱爲第一期工程。估計需款三萬萬元，完成之後，受益範圍計達五百萬畝。現第一年經定從靠近鬥龍港處着手，一年半後可先局部收益。（二）浚墾江南東太湖計劃，大旨係開闢邊沿及疏浚下游河道，以永久保持洩量，並仍留一部分作爲準備蓄洪庫以增進有效蓄量。庫內平時騰空種稻，潦年則開放蓄水，因原係一浜，故開放時蓄量轉多。至於平時借湖爲田，以增農產，潦來還田爲湖，以容暴洪，此乃兩者兼顧辦法。上兩項因係生利事業，故需款雖巨，當可不難希望各方投資舉辦，其財政計劃正在舉辦中。至材料方面，除東太湖浚墾所需大量抽水機尙須設法外，其餘原料因需要數量不多，可無問題。又該項工程甚巨，但經已擬定採用儷工制。按時値發給工價，此兩大水利事業之推進，將於　陸　　　收增進農產之效云。</p>

<h3>日本的元帥</h3>
<p>元帥爲武人最高的榮譽，係　予列入元帥府的　海軍大將的稱號，爲軍事上的最高顧間。元帥府條例第三條：</p>
<p>「奉　行使　　軍的檢閱」。</p>
<p>其地位有如國務上的元老，旣無國法上的職務，亦無定期的集合，爲純粹的日軍元老。</p>
<p>元帥的名號，在明治初年。係一種職名，乃位於大將之上的一等官、西鄉　　於明洽五年七月被任爲元帥。其成爲今日賜予大將中動重卓越的稱號者、尙係明治三十一年一月十九日的元帥府條例所改。大正七年八月，更附加了元帥刀　元帥　　的條例。</p>
<p>元帥佩刀用黃金鑄造，附近嵌金銀綫的紫革團紐，柄五寸五分。　二尺六寸，　上古賜予征　大將軍錦旗與太刀的「箭刀式」，尖端二而有刃，迄今日止，　列於　帥府者，陸軍十四員，海軍十一員，中有皇族三黃。山本大將戰死時即賜號元帥，這尙是最近的事。加藤友三郎，島村速　二大將，亦係於病危　時被列入元帥府，以元帥冀格期務年間最長者爲　鄉元帥，前後　二十二年之久。</p>
<p>今日元帥僅有皇族中的三位　下，臣下的三大將於戰時下列於元帥府，其意　極爲深刻。</p>
<p>山本元帥以前的元帥爲上原，武散養　元帥，武籐大將在　退休期前　號元帥，以　關東軍司令官的重責。武藤元帥於二個月之後　逝</p>

<h3>空軍採用新戰術　德北部空防鞏固　美機襲德反蒙重大損失</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　美空軍近對德本土西北部之大空襲，乃係以不來梅港爲中心，然於空襲之際，已顯示德軍防衛之完備，曾有敵機喪失二十五架，而德方却毫無損害之事實，此實値得注目。據德國通信社軍事記者斯萊柏稱：此次德軍之防禦戰得獲完全成功者，實由於德軍新航空戰術與德空軍將兵勇戰之功績。在柏林之軍事消息靈通對此次德美空軍之熾烈空戰，德方未失一機，而敵方竟損失重轟炸機二十五架之事，亦深感驚異。由此可見敵機欲突破德軍之防壁，確無可能，如敵自溝上進襲時，必須橫斷海岸地區，但敵於未達海岸地區之前，德戰鬥機隊必迅速起而迎擊，令敵不能完成任務而遁去。</p>

<h3>德蘇戰爭二年來的回顧</h3>
<p>德蘇戰爭在水月二十二日進入第三年，在婉蜓二千五百公里的戰綫上，展開了歷史上空前未有的慘烈的戰鬥，戰局的變化，波瀾迭起，迄今尙不分勝負。夏季已經光降到戰塲了，大規模空戰的日趨激烈，正暗浪第三次的激鬥的行將開始，其動靜頗堪注目，德蘇戰爭之依然爲歐洲戰局之主要舞台，毫無變更。唯當展望其實際狀況時，不容吾人遽下樂　的　測。茲囘顧過去二年來的經過，以爲推測未來戰局的展開之一助。</p>
<p>自開戰以來，迄今日止，德蘇戰可大　爲如次五期：</p>
<p>（一）德軍進攻期；（二）第一次蘇聯軍冬季反攻時代：（三）所謂「夏季陣」時代；（四）第二次蘇聯軍冬季反攻時代；（五）兩軍對峙時代。</p>
<p>前年六月二十二日，希特勒總統的進攻命令一下，待機於國境綫的德軍即揭開了進攻蘇聯的序幕，北部軍以列寗格勒爲目標，中央軍以莫斯科爲目標，南部軍以烏克闌爲目標，向各該方面前進。至九月，德軍的進攻獲得顧著的成功。在北部取包圍列甯格勒市的形勢，中部則衝到莫斯科的西郊，南部則昭烏克　首都基輔，進迫唐巴斯大工業地帶。但經此冷拳的蘇聯軍，逐漸整頓陣勢，以俄國人特有的黏靭性作頑强的抵抗，加以自十月中旬起，百四十年來未曾有的嚴寒降臨東戰綫，以至軍事行動受到極度的限制。列甯格勒包圍戰，莫斯科西部戰，陷於膠着狀態，即在南部，德軍先鋒部隊雖突入要衝羅斯托夫，卒因蘇聯軍的反攻而撤退。至十二月七日，德軍終於不得已中止攻勢。這是第一期。</p>
<p>繼於去年三月前、蘇聯軍趁冬季的天時齊夫溫地區，莫斯科西部，唐巴斯地區，克里米半島等地反攻，恢復了若干地方，至第三期，德軍在去年五月八日開始攻擊克爾赤，自六月二十八日起，開始南都集中攻勢，與前年不同，德軍僅在自庫斯克以西至卡科夫，塔千羅格的南部戰綫傾其主力作突破作戰，中部北部則取守勢狀態，進迫伏洛尼慈及羅斯托夫的德軍，分爲二路，以一部向高加索中部，另一部向伏爾伽河畔的斯達林格勒，蘇聯軍雖明知機動戰非德軍之敵，但據陣地頑抗，尤以斯達林格勒之載，其激烈得未曾有。</p>
<p>但大自然毫不容赦地又降臨了。十一月初旬，德軍出沒地帶高加索中部的摩斯托夫，奈里齊克地區一片雪白，斯達林格勒地區亦處於嚴寒之下。十一月十九日準備第二次冬季反攻的蘇聯軍，從斯達林格勒，頓河中游，伏洛尼　方面一齊開始行動，更自十二月末起在摩斯托克，奈里齊克地區反攻，因此，迄本年二月，德軍卒百斯達林格勒，羅斯托夫，伏洛尼慈，庫斯克及北高加索等地撤退，但三月初旬，德軍重又奪取卡科夫，爲蘇聯軍的鳥克蘭浸透作戰上的一大掣肘。其餘北部中部戰綫，蘇軍也從事反攻，維里其洛基，維耶　瑪等地的德軍被迫撤退。如此，相當大規模的蘇軍第二次反攻，遂於三月告終。之後德蘇二軍的陣形即犬牙交錯，極爲複雜，顯呈膠着狀態，以至於今日。</p>
<p>在這期間，庫彭地區的局部戰鬥，與日趨激烈的德蘇空軍報復轟炸，愈演愈烈。德空軍對果利基，耶洛斯拉比里，薩刺托夫等地的長距離轟炸，以摧毀蘇聯的培養戰力之源泉爲目標，同時確保庫彭地區，依然向高加索上了重大的壓力。無論如何，在過去二年中，德蘇二軍互相知悉了彼此的長所與短處，局部的說來，無一不是閃電戰鬥的展開，但全般的說來，則分成四個階段。唯德軍在開戰之初所獲得的戰略的主導性，迄今不變，常加重壓於蘇聯。（翼：譯自六月二十一日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>上海雜誌聯合會成立</h3>
<p>「上海雜誌聯合會」已於昨日正式成立。這是　國文化將有新的發展的又一個　象。</p>
<p>上海過去各雜誌社，既少相互的聯絡，更少一致的結合，以致不免遭遇很多的困難。舉其犖犖大者，如：</p>
<p>（一）各種雜誌因均有其獨自的個性，但也常發現某些雜誌所刊載的文字，或內容類似，或宛譯自同一原文。這種重復，都是精神與物質的虛擲。</p>
<p>（二）因各雜誌社單獨力量薄弱，殊難購置充份的參攷資料；又因各雜誌社相　作家不多，往往有了理想的主題而不易約到適當的選述者。這是使各雜誌的內容未能按列預定計劃，達到理想境地的原因之一。</p>
<p>（三）近來因爲物質環境的變化，已使各雜誌遭到了新的難關。如紙價的一再高漲，使有些雜誌減縮了篇幅。亦有難乎爲繼者。再如廣告費的提高，使經濟困難的雜誌，在出版後無力刊登廣告，使社會上普遍知悉。這是文化界前途的危機，不但是雜誌本身的厄運而已。</p>
<p>如今既成立了「雜誌聯合會」上述三點當可找到合理的解決。</p>
<p>（一）各雜誌社　該會之成立而取得經常的聯絡以後，對於取材的內容，當可隨時磋商，避免類同或重複，而使各謀發菜其獨特的個性。供應讀者以我方面的精神食糧。</p>
<p>（二）對於參考資料的交換與著作人之聯絡，藉此互相協助，而使各雜誌的內容益爲充實完美。</p>
<p>（三）以聯合會的名義，將可更有效的向各關係當局以平價公平配給紙張，與優待文化廣告，藉以減輕各雜誌社的物質負担，而得以繼續發展。</p>
<p>最後，文化人的清苦，至今爲　，這也是陷目　文化事業於式微的一大原因。所以，如何謀各雜誌社的負責人（尤其如編輯等）以及各作家的生活福利。也是當前急待解決的一個問題。</p>
<p>更有適者，「雜誌聯合會」的組織，主要地是在謀「研究期刊出版事業之發展，發揮期刊事業之文化使命與性出能」；但一國文化之振興，除掉雜誌的出版以外，顯然更有待於全國文化界之共同努力。因此，我們很希望像「文化協會」一類一般文化性的組織，能在最短期內成立起來。共同謀全國文化事業的計劃，文化活動的調整，與文化前途的發展。</p>
<p>文化之興衰，是決定國民精神與知識的一大力量，　，我們不但期望「雜誌聯合會」以及未來的「文化人協會」（假定各稱）等組織，要站在本位上從事於實際有利於文化發展的工作。並且也希望名關係當局以及全團有胞，予以督促，指導與扶助！</p>

<h3>「貫澈物資統制，強化運輸」</h3>
<p>政府爲謀樹立　個戰時經濟體制，加強全國經濟委員會議，使其　屬國府，爲參戰後戰時經濟最高企劃機關，舉行會議凡兩次；第二次會議，於增加工業及農業生產而外，特別注重「貫澈物資統制，強化運輸」一點，此爲戰　經濟政　　領之一，自宜特別加以重視。溯自商業統制總會成立以來，爲時已閱三月，所費時間經濟，不可謂少，顧在工作方面，惟忙機關之組織，與人才之應付，而於物資統制之本身事業，尙未待於整個工作之惟進，內地之農產品，　不易運入工業區，而工業區之機製品，亦艱於輸往各地，致形成阻隔不通之現狀；難原因不止一端，而各種機關配合之未盡健全，人事處理之不盡適當，實爲其主因之一，其影響於整個經濟這設施，實爲巨大。政府當局迭據各方報告，亦不能不認爲憾事，故第二次全國經濟委員會義，有「貫澈物資統制，強化運輸」之議案，用心至遠用意甚深，希望商統會與各同業公會在職同人，仰體斯旨，急起努力，以完成整個戰時體制以內之工作。同時，各交通機關以及級政府尤須明白經建設計劃之艱巨，能力合作，不稍　卸，共同致力於運輸事業之推進，物資統制之貫澈。</p>
<h3>申報杯籃球圓滿結束　中青榮獲申報杯　西青昨三十一比二十一勝中青　劍橋老人出四萬元高價購義球</h3>
<p>中華青年會暨　本報聯合主辦之「申報杯華北賑災籃球賽」，在熱烈情緒與順利進展下，業於昨晚宣告功德圓滿。此次義戰，成績收獲，至爲獎滿，即義球競賣一項，綜計已達九萬四千元之鉅，益以捐款及門票收入，兩共當在十五萬元左右。惟詳細數字，尚須精密核算，即日當可公布。昨晚爲議賽最後一場，未及七時，早告客滿，觀眾之盛，未輸前昨。西青在兩敗之餘，昨乃奮力作困獸之　，終以哀師必勝。在過程屢占先壽。中青因錦標在握。未爲已甚，遂於禮讓爲先之下，被西青以三十一比二十一，佔取最後之勝利。惟前半成各十七平分。足見奮戰之激烈。總成　二對一，中青以三戰兩捷，榮獲申報杯銀杯，西青則獲紀念杯一座。賽畢，由林康侯氏給獎，陳彬　氏致謝詞，盛會遂告功德圓滿昨　義球拍資，興奮熱烈，更上一層，抬價情況，尢稱狂熱，結果由林康侯經募，歸劍橋老人以四萬元鉅款購去。連日籃球義費，迭創最高峰巔，尤以昨晚之四萬分不清，更稱空前，並亦打破本市一切義球（包括足球）之紀錄，嘉惠災黎，爲善最樂，雲情萬誼，至足欽佩也法下時間已屆，在裁判劉荷生兪菊廬鳴笛之後，兩隊開始接觸。中青猛攻未　，而林　聰與桌國榮光後犯規，陶勃林基剛罰兩中，先獲兩分。未幾林維聰邊射中籃，扳成各二。然防務稍鬆，陶勃林基竟又三元連中，小林籃下托入，余郇子罰球成功，始追成五比八分。惟凱齊穿楊妙射，又成十比五局面，中青奮力苦戰，馬余兩射，成　一罰。終於找成各十。迨陶勃林基遠射，再度超越　，馬余吳三射三中，頓以十六比十二，後來居上。　自十七比十四以後，終被陶勃林基與佛尼克之一罰一射，追成各十七蘋等。而結束上半時。</p>
<p>後半西青肉博成功</p>
<p>再戰聲起，四青亡命奮鬥。佛尼克耶龍B沙司金等聯球射發，連增七分，中青力事支撐，僅於二十一比十七，及二十五比十八時，馬燦希與唐學聲各中一罰。此後佛呢克探籃，又中兩罰，蒙諾脫一射，比分突增至三十一，中青　調人馬，仍無起色。而球運又劣，屢射失告鵠。比馬燦希遠射成功。而鑼聲憶鏜然矣，總結三十一比二十一。西青報捷。</p>

<h3>是非種種</h3>
<p>— 靑照</p>
<p>應史若不給人以敎訓，只是事實表面的一種紀錄，那就毫沒有一點價値。</p>
<p>暴露事物底眞面目，那是歷史家的主要任務。歷史家僅以眞名呼實物，可並不崇拜現狀。故眞實歷史家底個人命運，常是很悲慘的。例如中國舊時的太史　先生。</p>
<p>「暴露底藝術，便是認識底藝術。」</p>
<p>上帝授人眞理於其夢寐之中。黑格爾駁之曰：凡是於　寐中獲得的東西，多半是　囈。</p>
<p>聰明人並非「無誤」底化身。聰明人的特點，富可說是最能澈底於改過；最有勇氣和決心接受事實的敎訓。</p>
<p>「無誤」底化身並非人，而是上帝。（？）</p>
<p>然而，人總還要想求「無誤」的化身，而這化身，最好還是屬於他自己。巴爾扎克於是說：</p>
<p>當自己被人當神一樣樂拜的地方，自己是一點都不能夠看到自己的好壞的。</p>
<h3>暑期中的敎員</h3>
<p>— 陸愼廷</p>
<p>暑假到了，敎員們辛苦了一年也可休息　時候了。站在敎育界外面的人似乎不勝羨慕當敎員的福氣。能有兩個月的長期歇夏，其實他們那裏知道敎員們又起了恐慌、有的在改卷子的時候，甚至急得連鼻子上的汗珠都批了出來，他們正擔憂着下學期的「繼聘」與假期中的「修金」兩個問題呢！</p>
<p>在教員處境毫無保障的中國，那班老板變型的私立校長的心裏思量：「那兒來的　　……，？不妨乘此機會把敎員們洗換一新。樂得省下一筆假期中支給敎員們的終金。」</p>
<p>也是有　　　員　　太好，學生們不敢他們離去　　　校長也祗得硬　　　維持，敎員能拿到半　，也總算上上大吉了，精明的校長索性開個暑期補習　，　教員站在蒸籠似的教室裏去吊嗓子。結果非但這筆修金可以在敎員身上照牌頭，而且自己還能從中獲得漁利</p>
<p>道高一尺，魔高十丈，敎員修金之所得。萬萬趕不上生活程度一日千里的飛增。他們「吃飯」旣顧不周全，「穿衣」又休想美好：「家庭子女」更是九霄之外的事了，鐵一般的事實“也不需找一字一名來證明。總之在這　情形之下。誰也難保敎員們不　「跳出教育界去謀生活」的腦筋，於是就造成敎育破產的危機！</p>
<p>這已是起碼的論理：敎育的目的是使學生變成將來的好國民。如此，　必先使學生受到良好的敎育。要使學生受到良好的教育，必先使教員們安心認眞地敎　。因此必先使敎員們有安定的生活。要使敎員們有安定的生活，當然是「加薪」！</p>
<p>可是現在敎員們非但不敢做「加薪的好夢」，反而在恐懼「暑假的威脅」呢！這眞是太不公平了。</p>
<p>教育與社會的關係極其密切，我們不應該袖手旁觀小學敎員們擔憂；我覺得就在眼前有個機會可使他們稍微安心的，是請校長們把開辦暑期學校的權利讓給敎員們，直接由敎員們收　學費，如　這樣辦。那未非但能　固敎員們下學期繼續的可能性。而且還能使他們多得一些利潤。兩個月的暑假威脅，自然也不足長了。（移酬華北賑災）</p>
<h3>磨刀石</h3>
<p>— 俞文中</p>
<p>假使我們將環境喻作磨刀石，那末每一個人就是一把刀。</p>
<p>我們都相信在一塊光滑的大理石上要磨快一把刀是非常困難的，不過不是絕對不可能的，祗要你拋却了「大理石是光滑的」成見，化了時間與精力耐心去磨，大優良的境况往往使人缺少向上的志氣，但我以爲你如果不以境况的美滿爲滿足，仍實發上進，將來不難成爲一個有用的人物，否則你將爲舒適的環境所誤，埋葬了寶貴的前途！</p>
<p>一塊「相當相糙」的磨刀石是最適宣於磨刀的，的確「相當惡劣」的環境容易把人磨鍊得堅決能幹，朋友—　如果處身在　　，孤獨的苦悶中；受　　　　　　　　　　　，那我爲你祝賀，請你不　　　「幸災來禍」，　　　一顆赤誠之心來慶祝你獲得一塊磨刀　石石，那把遍鈍的刀？就是你自已，大有被磨得　利的可能，此地怒我不　列舉古今中外從困苦中　鬥出來的大人物，以免浪費。</p>
<p>至於想在一塊凹凸不平的石　　磨快一把刀其可能性非常渺小，甚而至於把一把有用的刀　捲或損缺了刀口，我們相信小乞中不　具有科學，文學……等天才的人，將來大可造就，但不幸　中途夭折或者一生默默無聞，這不但是他們個人的寃屈。且是國家社會的損失，爲了要保存　批有用的刀，我們必須設法　平那些石頭！</p>
<h3>談「笑」</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>世界的進步是基礎在「笑」上的，「人」如果對於現實社會不滿意，認識了社會的破綻之後，愚笨的人也許會「悲哀」，發出絕望的哀鳴，或者「憤怒」得「側目而視」社會更處於極端的惡劣。但這全是不求改進的表現。所以只有「笑」的人是聰明的改造者，唯有「笑」能最有力地亦最和平地認識現實社會之最深處。最高超的「笑」的藝術是對於該「悲哀」，該「憤怒」事實的形態，並不是以「一笑了之」，而是能夠「笑着對付它」，一方而飄逸地「笑」着，而另一方而能由於對現實的簡陋，滑稽，矛盾，　惡，不統一，缺陷，不合理……加以嚴　地，正確地，深刻地改正成「不可笑」爲止。</p>
<p>但是很可惜，因爲有許多人的「笑」，只是充分地「哈哈」而巳，哈哈完了也完了，大的不滿意是哈哈，小的不滿意也是哈哈，把笑的力量全鬆弛了，這對於實社會又有何補呢？所以眞有笑的藝術的人，他是不輕易「哈哈」的，既是難得笑了也表示他是眞實看出破綻來了。</p>
<p>所以我們需要眞正會「笑」的人！</p>
<h3>友誼</h3>
<p>— 可時</p>
<p>尼采會說：「你是一名奴隸嗎？那麽你不能爲人友。你是一位暴君嗎？那麽你不能得友。」那麽究竟那一類人不可以得友　爲人友呢？依照上而的話，我們可以說，奴隸暴君之流，不可爲人之友。換句話脫即友誼是建立於完全平等的階級上，並不是建築於卑躬求乞和武力壓制的基確上，一心一意的想用獻媚的手段以求對方的歡心，或者用金錢的攏絡，利益的誘惑，甚至於用武、力的威脅，而得到對方的友誼。</p>
<p>「君子之交淡如水，小人之交甜如蜜。」這是刻劃友誼最確切的聒，前者是眞正的友情，永恒的友誼，而後者是片刻的，虛僞的。在初交時往往表示出相見恨晚的情况、好像世界上只有　們二者之間才配有友誼的產生，假使有第三者的挿入，則會發生妒忌或者爭風吃醋的後果。但一旦爲了某種利害問題而起衝突，則二人之問的以往交情，立刻化爲泡影，和陌路生人一樣。</p>
<p>友誼——世界上唯一無刺的玫瑰、我們該永遠的保存他，愛護他，正像馬達加斯加的諺語一樣，「願你的友誼，像口和手一樣，手痛時用口去吹，口痛時用手去撫。」</p>
<h3>善惡</h3>

        <h1>1943.06.29</h1>
<h3>The Third Year of the Eastern Front and the "Western Front" Problem</h3>
<p>The unprecedented large-scale Eastern Front war—the German-Soviet War—has entered its third year. As the Japanese Asahi Shimbun pointed out in its editorial on June 24th, the biggest lesson from the German-Soviet War is that it refuted the fallacy of the so-called "short-term war" between Germany and the Soviet Union, advocated by some strategists at the beginning of the war, and fully exposed the character of a long-term war. Therefore, to judge the situation and prospects of the German-Soviet War, we must stand on this serious fact to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions.</p>
<p>The Eastern Front entering its third year of operations, precisely after more than three months of unexpected silence, what does this signify? Generally speaking, in the past two years, the timing of the seasons has had a significant impact on the Eastern Front. After each spring, the German army would begin large-scale offensive warfare, and when the severe cold season began, it would give the Soviet Union an opportunity to counterattack. However, today, when spring has passed and summer has begun—the very time when the German army should be launching a major offensive—why is the war on the Eastern Front still only manifested in localized battles in the Kuban region and Kursk, Orel, and other places, and the active air force offensive and defensive battles, without seeing the German army launch a major offensive? Does this mean that the German army is not preparing or unable to launch such a major offensive this summer? We want to point out that these issues must be observed from a comprehensive perspective by the most serious and accurate observers. First of all, can we ask such a question: When the German army has not launched a major offensive, why doesn't the Soviet Union seize the initiative and take further counteroffensives against the German army? We must first answer this question before we can proceed to estimate the trend of Germany's offensive and the development of the entire war situation.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's inability to seize the initiative and develop a counteroffensive in the summer is not a question of whether they want to, but whether they can. First of all, in the past two years, the Soviet army's losses have been alarmingly heavy. According to German reports, the Soviet side's manpower losses (including seriously wounded prisoners) are no less than 20 million. And according to the Soviet side's own admission, "deaths and disappearances" also amounted to 4.2 million, and they also lost 35,000 artillery pieces of various calibers, 30,000 tanks, and 22,000 aircraft. These figures have certainly been greatly discounted in reality, but they can also be said to be "heavy losses." Therefore, the Soviet Union has encountered major difficulties in terms of human resources, economic productivity, and general economic productivity. Therefore, launching a major counteroffensive following the winter is absolutely not an easy task, except in idle talk on paper. The result may completely shake its national foundation. Can the Soviet Union do this? Ultimately, no matter how beautiful the speeches and telegrams of Roosevelt and Churchill are, no matter how the expectations and subjective demands of Britain and the United States are, the "Second Front," that is, the "Western Front," has not been realized. Here, the main reason is not so much the seriousness of the political contradictions between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, but rather the difficulties of Britain and the United States themselves. Within Britain and the United States, there is a domestic front. In Britain, there are contradictions between the Conservative Party and the various left-wing parties, as well as the Labour Party and the Communist Party. In the United States, the American Federation of Labor is no different from an enemy country within the United States. The recent waves of coal mine strikes have directly hindered and damaged American military industrial production, and even constrained the anti-Axis powers' strategic actions to open a Western Front. In addition, the black issue and the issues of various countries in Central and South America are becoming as active as the Indian revolutionary movement in the East at this critical moment, when Britain and the United States are attempting to attack Europe, and they are settling accounts with the United States and Britain. Therefore, the so-called Second Front is still just a slogan. However, this fact is the heaviest blow to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Information Bureau itself stated on the second anniversary of the war: "Letting go of the favorable opportunity to open a Second Front in Europe in 1943 and delaying this action will seriously damage our common cause. Delaying the opening of a Second Front in Europe will prolong the war, which will greatly increase the sacrifice." The above two points can fully explain why the Soviet Union cannot launch a counteroffensive.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union cannot counterattack, and at the same time, the "Western Front" will not appear all of a sudden. Does this mean that Germany can develop an offensive? As long as it is not just a superficial observation, there will never be this conclusion. Because, first, as the Japanese Asahi Shimbun pointed out on June 24th, although the Soviet Union has encountered difficulties in terms of human resources, military industrial production, and general economic strength, it has been working hard to reorganize its production capacity due to the advantage of its vast territory. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's combat effectiveness and its strong political power are still not to be underestimated. Second, although the "Western Front" may not be opened or developed for a while, the main reason is the obstruction of domestic problems in Britain and the United States. Recently, the appointment of Wavell as the Governor-General of India by Britain, as well as the publicity of cabinet reshuffles, the continued active movement of the merger of the Communist Party and the Labour Party, and the work on the labor front in the United States, although they will not have any important gains, it can also be seen that Britain and the United States are preparing for the domestic front. Therefore, the possibility of Britain and the United States taking risks still exists. If Germany acts rashly at this time, it is difficult to say what its future position will be in the long-term war. Therefore, Germany's cautious attitude towards the summer offensive is more like the silence of a lion. Mr. Moriyama, the Berlin correspondent of Asahi Shimbun, issued a dispatch on June 10th, specifically reporting the change in Germany's strategy for the war against the Soviet Union: "Seeking new solutions to the war against the Soviet Union from the two aspects of political power and military power." Mr. Moriyama especially pointed out that the German side is very concerned about and studying the countermeasures taken by Japan in the occupied territories in the South, and deeply admires Prime Minister Tojo's declaration of independence for the Philippines. He explained the evolution of Germany's strategic policy toward the Soviet Union: "In the first year, the main force of the Red Army's field army was annihilated; in the second year, the land resources of the Soviet Union were occupied; in the second year, its characteristic was the mobilization of political power." (Translation can be found on page 3 of the June 24th issue of this newspaper) This can be regarded as an important new policy adopted by Germany in response to the above facts.</p>
<p>The new strategy for the war against the Soviet Union, which combines political power and military power, does not naturally mean that Germany will not launch a major offensive on the Eastern Front, but only that it will launch a more powerful offensive based on a more cautious and foolproof plan, while also including strikes against the possible adventurous strategies of Britain and the United States. We firmly believe that Germany's current caution is precisely a factor in future victory. And the guarantee of this victory is the maintenance of Germany's rear productivity and general economic strength, and the advancement of military industrial production (see the June 23rd and 24th issues of this newspaper, "The Attitude of German Wartime Enterprises"). We can clearly say that the silence on the Eastern Front will not last too long, and the clamor on the Western Front will still be a futile clamor.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Zhou Fohai and Economic Advisor Ishiwata Arrived in Hankou from Nanjing Yesterday to Discuss Financial Issues in the Wuhan Area</h3>
<p>Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) The Minister of Finance of the National Government, Mr. Zhou Fohai, and the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, Mr. Sotaro Ishiwata, arrived here at 12:20 noon on the 28th by plane to discuss financial issues in the Wuhan area.</p>
<p>Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) Minister of Finance Zhou Fohai of the National Government, in order to inspect the current financial situation of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, specially accompanied Counselor Huang, Director Xue, Committee Member Xiong, and Chief Ma, flew from Nanjing by special plane on the morning of the 28th. The Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, Sotaro Ishiwata, also came along. They arrived safely at the airport here at 12:20 noon on the same day. Those who came to the airport to welcome them included Governor Yang, Mayor Zhang, Special Envoy Wang of the Ministry of Finance, Manager Hong of the Central Reserve Bank branch, Assistant Manager Huang, and the directors of various departments and bureaus of the provincial and municipal governments, as well as representatives of various institutions. From the allied countries, there were Minister Ochiai, Naval Attaché Okino, and Advisor Ta, etc. After Minister Zhou got off the plane, he greeted the welcomers one by one, exchanged brief pleasantries, and then took a special car to his residence to rest. In the afternoon, Special Envoy Wang and Manager Hong hosted a banquet at the Yihua Village Reception Center to welcome Minister Zhou and others, with the provincial and municipal officials accompanying them. During the banquet, there was much toasting and the atmosphere was very harmonious. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 2 o'clock.</p>
<p>Minister Zhou Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Hankou, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) Minister of Finance of the National Government and President of the Central Reserve Bank Zhou Fohai, arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at 12:20 noon on the 28th. After a brief rest, he visited the Japanese military and political authorities stationed in Hankou. In the afternoon, at 5 o'clock, he held a reception at the Wuhua Hotel for Wuhan Chinese and Japanese newspaper reporters and issued a statement. At 7 o'clock, he attended a banquet hosted by Governor Yang of the provincial government, with the directors of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government accompanying him. During the banquet, there was much toasting and the atmosphere was very harmonious. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 9 o'clock. The original text of the statement is recorded below: I came to Wuhan once in the 29th year of the Republic of China after the National Government returned to the capital. It has been three years since then. During these three years, I often wanted to come to Wuhan to inspect, but I was unable to spare the time due to busy matters. This time, I am very pleased to see the leaping progress in Wuhan's public security, politics, economy, and youth training. The assistance of the allied country, the efforts of the provincial and municipal government colleagues, and the support of the people are all achievements that cannot be ignored. It is a pleasure for me to have this opportunity to represent the Central Government to express my deep gratitude to the allied country and our country's officials and people. In particular, I cannot but express my gratitude for the great cooperation given by the allied country and the provincial and municipal authorities in the implementation of the Central Government's financial policy and monetary policy. Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, it has developed a relationship of sharing weal and woe with the allied country Japan, and has advanced to sharing life and death. Therefore, how our country should cooperate with the allied country, with the determination to die for a sure survival, is something that our country's officials and people should painstakingly ponder day and night to seek improvement. There are countless ways to cooperate, and we should make efforts in all aspects, but the most important thing is to strengthen the strength of finance and banking.</p>
<p>For three years, the National Government has been adhering to a sound financial policy, and the financial foundation has been established. At present, the government's expenditure has increased more than seven times compared to when it returned to the capital, but so far, it has not issued a single public bond, nor has it overdrawn a single penny from the Central Reserve Bank. The soundness of the finances can be seen from this. However, after China's participation in the war, there are many undertakings that must be carried out due to the war, such as expanding armaments, establishing public security, and developing industry. These undertakings all require funds. Therefore, the central task in the future is how to increase tax revenue to meet the needs of wartime finance and strengthen combat effectiveness. Regarding this point, the central government has studied a thorough plan to gradually implement it. The reorganization of Wuhan's national tax is also within this plan. After the National Government returned to the capital, I came to Wuhan once to organize the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Provisional Financial Reorganization Committee to meet the needs of the time. Thanks to the efforts of the committee and the assistance of the allied country, Wuhan's finances have been put on the right track. The mission that the Reorganization Committee should bear has been completed. Now, at the beginning of a new era, there must be a new institution to adapt to it. Therefore, the temporary organization of the Reorganization Committee will be terminated and changed to a normal Financial Special Envoy Office. In the future, how to increase tax revenue, how to equalize the burden on the people, and how to take both central and local finances into consideration, all depend on the planning and implementation of this office. I hope that the provincial and municipal officials and the authorities of the allied country will continue to cooperate with it so as to complete its mission and further strengthen the National Government's wartime financial policy.</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank has now become a national bank worthy of the name, and the Reserve Certificates it issues have also become the only currency in Central and Southern China. In the past, the promotion of Reserve Certificates has been deeply supported by the provincial and municipal officials and the authorities of the allied country. I hereby reiterate my gratitude. The task in the future is how to stabilize finance and achieve its sound development. The wartime financial policy has been detailed by the National Economic Commission and is being gradually implemented by us. The most important thing is to put finance on the right track, so that funds are invested in productive undertakings and not abused for speculation. For this purpose, the government has specially established a Financial Inspection Office to guide and supervise it. A branch office was established in Wuhan on the 20th. It is hoped that the establishment of this branch office will further promote the sound development of Wuhan's finance and the revitalization of Wuhan's industry.</p>
<h3>Vice President Zhou Advises the People of China and Japan to Briefly Express Their Views on the New Development of Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government of China, recently briefly expressed his views on the new development of Sino-Japanese relations under the title of "Miscellaneous Observations on the Current Situation." The main points are recorded as follows: Since China declared war on Britain and the United States, the relationship between China and Japan has become closer, especially after Chairman Wang Jingwei expressed his determination to share life and death with Japan. Japan also responded by issuing a statement, actively preparing to abolish extraterritorial rights, return concessions, transfer economic control affairs to the Chinese side, and transfer some American and British enemy properties to our country for management. This time, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo also declared in parliament that he was preparing to revise the original treaties between China and Japan. Therefore, Japan's respect for China's independence and autonomy, and enabling China to obtain an equal and free position in the international arena, has been declared in reality. In the past, there were many Chinese people who doubted Japan's sincerity, but judging from the current state of affairs, they should absolutely trust the sincerity of the Japanese government. I have infinite respect for Prime Minister Tojo's great vision, thinking about the long-term plan for East Asia, and establishing a solid foundation. At this important time, the people of China and Japan must have an accurate understanding and give it support and trust. If they lack understanding, it will lead to unfortunate consequences. China must recognize that Japan's implementation of the new policy this time is completely out of spontaneous sincerity, and should not mistakenly believe that Japan has to implement the new policy because its overall war power is gradually weakening. As a result of Japan's acquisition of abundant resources in the South Seas, its combat power has been significantly enhanced compared to before. This time, with the progress of the development of the South Seas, Japan's combat power will become more and more substantial. The United States and Britain are trying to force Japan with a war of attrition, but the result is that they themselves are in a difficult situation. In the military aspect, relying solely on air guerrilla warfare will not be able to determine victory or defeat. It is difficult for the United States and Britain to provoke a decisive battle with Japan with ground troops. Not only can the American and British ground troops not invade the Japanese mainland, but it is also difficult to make a comeback in the Japanese-occupied territories. The gains and losses of only one or two small islands will not affect the victory or defeat. Japan has this kind of sure-win and undefeated attitude and determination, and is implementing a new policy toward China, which is full of sincerity in respecting China. If the Chinese people cannot recognize this fact and act arrogantly, it will inevitably arouse the resentment of the Japanese people. As a result, it will make it difficult for the Japanese government to implement the new policy, or even cause a reversal of the situation, and there is a risk of deterioration of the friendly relations between the two countries. Therefore, the Chinese people must be especially careful about this point. The Japanese people must also recognize that the implementation of the new policy this time aims to establish a permanent peace in East Asia, and is by no means trying to induce the Chongqing government to participate in the peace movement. The Japanese government's measures this time are completely out of sincerity and do not contain any strategic nature. I hope that the Japanese people can fully understand this fact. If the Japanese people believe that after the Japanese government implements the new policy, the Chongqing government will waver and return to the National Government, it can be said to be too ideal. If there are Japanese people who have this kind of hope, they will naturally first doubt the government's new policy, then feel disappointed, and even oppose the new policy. The Japanese people should follow the government's sincerity and determination, regardless of whether the Chongqing government participates in the peace movement or not, and thoroughly cooperate with the new policy. It would be great if the Chongqing government could realize this and participate in the peace movement, but if it cannot be realized, the new policy must continue to be promoted. We firmly believe that after Japan thoroughly implements the new policy toward China, the title and reason for the Chongqing government's resistance will completely disappear. Therefore, the Chongqing government's blind actions cannot last. Therefore, Japan's implementation of the new policy toward China will promote the Chongqing government to stop resisting. But it must be known that this is only one of the conditions included in several conditions, and it is by no means the only condition. To achieve comprehensive peace between China and Japan, several conditions must be overcome, such as the changes in the international situation. Japan's new policy toward China is the most important and fundamental of several conditions, but it cannot be regarded as the only condition. In other words, even if Japan implements the new policy toward China, it cannot be expected that the Chongqing government will immediately show wavering collapse and voluntarily request peace. However, it would be wrong to oppose the new policy and advocate its reversal because this kind of expectation cannot be realized. As the name suggests, the new policy is a policy rather than a strategy. Now is the time of historical transformation. If there is a mistake in understanding, it will lead to unfortunate consequences. Therefore, I would like to offer my loyal advice to the people of China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Launches Short Hair Movement, Minister Lin Takes the Lead in Demonstrating, All Trainees in the Summer Training Camp Must Cut Their Hair Short</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) Summer has arrived, and hygiene is very important. The short hair movement under wartime conditions is gradually being launched by leaders at all levels. Lin Baisheng, Secretary-General of the New Citizens' Movement Association and Secretary-General of the China Youth Model Scope, took the lead in cutting his hair short. As a result, most of the staff of the various agencies affiliated to the New Citizens' Movement Association followed suit and automatically cut off their long hair. Those who still have it have no more than three centimeters. All the specialist members of the First Brigade of the Model Scope and many people from the press in this city have also appeared with bald heads. It seems that the atmosphere is developing and the short hair movement is becoming more and more popular.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) The civil servants and the youth corps of the two camps of trainees in the summer training camp entered the camp on the 28th. The two camps had considerable planning in advance for the camp entry procedures and the reception staff, so the order was very good. The youth corps camp also produced a student handbook, which contains discussions on the New Movement, the government's published outline, and various New Movement training camp regulations and rules. The planned events for the 29th are: (1) individual talks, (2) physical examinations, (3) self-descriptions, and (4) movies.</p>
<p>(Also reported) The weekend training camp adopts strict principles for the management of trainees. In view of the necessity of summer hygiene and short hair movement during the wartime non-summer training, all staff, from the battalion commander downwards, took the lead in cutting their hair short, practicing the New Movement. The trainees are also limited to no more than three centimeters, and female trainees are cut to the ears. Once training begins, there will be no long hair, and the team can be seen to be energetic.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Construction Plans to Undertake Two Major Water Conservancy Projects</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency telegram) In order to adapt to the wartime economic plan and actively promote urgent construction projects, the Ministry of Construction has prepared a three-year construction plan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the plan focuses on the development of agricultural production and water conservancy, so as to achieve the goal of increasing production to enrich people's livelihood. Therefore, the two major water conservancy projects of opening up the Subei New Canal and dredging the East Taihu Lake in Jiangnan are listed first, and the relevant parties are planning to carry them out. The general outline of the project is as follows: (1) Opening the Subei New Canal: It is planned to open a new canal running from north to south in the area, supplemented by branch canals and dams, so as to form a perfect drainage and irrigation system, so that there is no worry about flooding and drought, and all of it can be reclaimed for cotton planting. In the three-year plan, it is planned to first open a section from Jiaoxie Town to Xinyang Port, which is 130 kilometers long and is called the first phase of the project. The estimated cost is 30 million yuan. After completion, the area benefited will reach 5 million mu. It has been decided to start from near Doulonggang in the first year, and partial benefits can be achieved in one and a half years. (2) The plan to dredge the East Taihu Lake in Jiangnan is mainly to open up the edges and dredge the downstream rivers, so as to permanently maintain the discharge capacity, and still leave a part as a prepared flood storage reservoir to increase the effective storage capacity. The reservoir is usually emptied for rice planting, and in flood years, it is opened for water storage. Because it was originally a beach, the storage capacity increases when it is opened. As for borrowing the lake for farming in peacetime to increase agricultural production, and returning the fields to the lake in flood years to accommodate flash floods, this is a way to take both into account. Because the above two items are profitable undertakings, although the funds required are huge, it is not difficult to hope that all parties will invest in them. The financial plan is being organized. As for the materials, in addition to the large number of water pumps required for dredging the East Taihu Lake, the remaining raw materials will not be a problem because the quantity required is not large. Also, the project is very large, but it has been decided to adopt the system of work according to labor. The price of labor will be paid on time. The promotion of these two major water conservancy projects will greatly increase agricultural production.</p>

<h3>Japan Divides Into Nine Regions to Strengthen Internal Political Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in order to cope with the new situation under the decisive battle, passed emergency decisive battle measures in the 82nd extraordinary session of the Diet. The purpose was to prepare enterprises to increase food production, and to prepare a winning posture within the country. This time, in order to smoothly implement these measures and further improve the domestic situation, it was decided to drastically reform the operation of internal affairs based on new concepts. Therefore, a special temporary cabinet meeting was convened at 2:00 p.m. on the 28th to formally approve its outline. After amending the county system and personnel matters, the Information Bureau announced the main points of the internal affairs reform passed this time, dividing Japan into nine regions: "Hokkaido," "Tohoku," "Kanto," "Hokuriku," "Tokai," "Kinki," "Chugoku," "Shikoku," and "Kyushu." The central officials of each region are authorized to direct the governors under their jurisdiction to be responsible for the comprehensive operation of the region's overall administration. Therefore, local administrative councils are added to the nine regions to quickly and fully implement the government's highest policy to the local areas, in order to smoothly promote production, distribution, transportation, port administration, and other matters related to enhancing combat effectiveness. At the same time, in order to use various complex local administrations, it is believed that close measures such as enterprise preparation and ensuring and increasing food production will be actively promoted and become more effective.

<h3>Anti-Axis Convoy Near the Strait of Sicily Attacked, Twelve Giant Transport Ships Sunk or Destroyed, 30 Enemy Aircraft Attacking Sardinia Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the German military, the German Air Force attacked a large anti-Axis convoy in the sea off Bizerte and the Strait of Sicily on the 26th, sinking or destroying twelve merchant ships weighing 74,000 tons. In addition, two landing craft and one warship were destroyed. According to Major Frei Dack, a military reporter for the German News Agency, the details of the battle were: On the morning of the 26th, German Air Force reconnaissance aircraft discovered a large anti-Axis transport convoy off the north coast of Tunisia, escorted by many destroyers, coastal defense ships, and other warships. The German Air Force then sent several large formations of fighter-bombers to pursue the enemy in the waters north of Bizerte at noon and immediately began to attack. The enemy immediately retaliated with fierce anti-aircraft fire, but the German Air Force still bravely carried out low-altitude bombing, first destroying a 15,000-ton transport ship full of soldiers, rendering it unable to move. It then severely damaged a 10,000-ton cargo ship carrying aircraft, and hit two 5,000-ton merchant ships, and set fire to an 8,000-ton oil tanker. After nightfall, the German army repeatedly attacked the convoy with heavy bomber formations, dropping large bombs and hitting three cargo ships. One of them was witnessed exploding, and the other two were engulfed in flames. Another ship was tilted and about to sink. It is speculated that all three ships have sunk. In addition, the German Air Force concentrated on bombing another four enemy cargo ships, ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 tons. Each ship was hit by one bomb, and it is predicted that the repair period will take several months. Only two German aircraft participating in the battle did not return.</p>
<p>Rome, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a German news agency today, the German and Italian air forces jointly bombed the enemy's sailing team last week without interruption. Italian torpedo planes sank a total of eight enemy ships, of which seven totaled 74,000 tons. In addition, eight ships and one oil tanker were also destroyed. Three enemy warships and seven cargo ships were hit and damaged by German and Italian aircraft during the bombing of Bizerte and Pantelleria. The Italian heavy bomber formation air-attacked the west coast of Egypt, and the traffic lines near Fuka were interrupted. Important military targets in Syria and Palestine were also bombed. The transportation center of El Agheila and the airfield of Latakia were also attacked. On the other hand, fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns were very effective in resisting enemy air raids. Within seven days, the British and Americans lost 111 aircraft, 70 of which were shot down in air combat. When enemy aircraft recently bombed Naples, the damage rate reached 20%. Moreover, no less than 33 enemy aircraft were lost over Sardinia in one day.</p>

<h3>Japanese Marshals</h3>
<p>Marshal is the highest honor for a military man, and it is a title granted to a naval admiral listed in the Marshal's Mansion, and is the highest advisor on military affairs. Article 3 of the Marshal's Mansion Ordinance:</p>
<p>"To inspect the military on behalf of the Emperor."</p>
<p>Their status is like that of a veteran statesman, with no legal duties or regular meetings. They are purely veterans of the Japanese military.</p>
<p>The title of Marshal in the early Meiji period was a functional title, a first-class official above the rank of General. Saigo Takamori was appointed Marshal in July of the 5th year of Meiji. It became today's title bestowed upon Generals of outstanding achievement in the 19th of January of the 31st year of Meiji with the revision of the Marshal's Mansion Ordinance. In the 8th month of the 7th year of Taisho, a Marshal's sword and Marshal's ... ordinance were further added.</p>
<p>The Marshal's sword is made of gold, surrounded by purple leather cords with gold and silver threads, the hilt being five and a half inches long. The blade is two feet six inches long, in the "arrow sword style" granted to the Generalissimo of old, with a sharpened tip. To date, there are fourteen army officers and eleven navy officers listed in the Marshal's Mansion, including three members of the Imperial family. Admiral Yamamoto was granted the title of Marshal upon his death, which is the most recent instance. Kato Tomosaburo and Shimamura Hayao were also listed in the Marshal's Mansion while critically ill. The longest-serving Marshal was Saigo, serving for 22 years.</p>
<p>Today, there are only three Princes of the Imperial family with the rank of Marshal. That three Generals are listed in the Marshal's Mansion during wartime has deep significance.</p>
<p>Marshals before Yamamoto were Uehara and Takeshi Nishi-Yoshi. General Muto was granted the title of Marshal before his retirement to recognize his heavy responsibility as commander of the Kwantung Army. Marshal Muto passed away two months later.</p>
<p>Those granted the title of Marshal include:</p>
<p>Prince Komatsu-no-miya Akihito (Army General), Yamagata Aritomo (Army), Oyama Iwao (Army), Saigo Yorimichi (Navy General), Nozu Michitsura (Army), Ito Sukeyuki (Navy), Prince Arisugawa Takehito (Navy), Prince Kan'in (Army), Inoue Yoshika (Navy), Togo Heihachiro (Navy), Hasegawa Yoshimichi (Army), Prince Fushimi Sadanaru (Army), Kawamura Kageaki (Army), Prince Kan'in Kotohito (Army), Terauchi Masatake (Army), Ijuin Goro (Navy), Uehara Yusaku (Army), Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito (Navy), Kato Tomosaburo (Navy), Shimamura Hayao (Navy), Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi (Army), Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu (Navy), Prince Nashimoto Morimasa (Army), Muto Nobuyoshi (Army), Yamamoto Isoroku (Navy).

<h3>Air Force Adopts New Tactics, Northern German Air Defense Consolidated, Heavy Losses in U.S. Attack on Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - The recent large-scale air raids by the U.S. Air Force on northwestern Germany were centered on Bremerhaven. However, during the air raids, the completeness of the German defense was displayed. It is noteworthy that the enemy lost 25 aircraft, while the German side suffered no damage. According to German News Agency military reporter Schleiber, the complete success of the German defense battle this time was due to the new German air combat tactics and the brave fighting of the German Air Force soldiers. Military insiders in Berlin were also deeply surprised that the German side did not lose a single aircraft in the fierce air battle between the German and American air forces this time, while the enemy lost 25 heavy bombers. This shows that it is indeed impossible for enemy aircraft to break through the German defense wall. If the enemy attacks from the ditch, it must cross the coastal area, but before the enemy reaches the coastal area, the German fighter squadrons will quickly rise to meet and repel them, preventing them from completing their mission.</p>
<h3>Chilean Left-Wing Parties Organize United Front</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 28th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports that Buenos Aires Radio announced that representatives of the Chilean Republican Party and the Labor Party have agreed to organize a united front. The number of trade union members participating will exceed 300,000, which may become a decisive factor in the Congress.</p>
<h3>Grew Re-Issues Warning That Japanese Potential Cannot Be Ignored, Davis Calls For British, American, and Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from New York: Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew gave a speech in Buffalo on the 25th, pointing out the consolidation of Japan's decisive battle system, saying in essence that it would be most dangerous for us to feel at ease because the Japanese army has recently remained calm. Under this superficial state of calm, the interior is working hard to cope with the new stage of the war. In order to surprise and win, the Japanese army will use all unexpected operations, that is, the Japanese army is better than the anti-Axis countries in combat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davis gave a speech at a public assembly in New York yesterday, again calling for close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. He said that without the Soviet Union, victory could not be guaranteed, and without the Soviet Union, there would be no post-war adjustment and peace. Therefore, understanding between major powers is necessary. The achievements of the Soviet government, army, and people are worthy of the freedom, trust, and respect of the free countries. Judging from the agreement established by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's goals and political measures are coordinated with other anti-Axis countries.</p>
<h3>A Review of the Two Years of the German-Soviet War</h3>
<p>The German-Soviet war entered its third year on July 22nd. On a 2,500-kilometer front, an unprecedentedly fierce battle was launched in history. The changes in the war situation were turbulent, and so far, no victory or defeat has been determined. Summer has already descended on the battlefield, and the increasingly fierce air battles are secretly brewing the start of the third fierce battle, and its trends are worthy of attention. The German-Soviet war remains the main stage of the European war situation, without any change. However, when looking at the actual situation, we cannot hastily make optimistic predictions. Now we review the past two years to help predict the future development of the war situation.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war to date, the German-Soviet war can be roughly divided into the following five phases:</p>
<p>(1) The German offensive phase; (2) The first Soviet winter counter-offensive era; (3) The so-called "summer array" era; (4) The second Soviet winter counter-offensive era; (5) The era of confrontation between the two armies.</p>
<p>On June 22nd of the year before last, as soon as President Hitler's offensive order was issued, the German army waiting on the border line began the offensive against the Soviet Union. The Northern Army aimed at Leningrad, the Central Army aimed at Moscow, and the Southern Army aimed at Ukraine, advancing towards each respective direction. By September, the German offensive had achieved significant success. In the north, it took the form of encircling the city of Leningrad, the center rushed to the western suburbs of Moscow, and the south seized the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, approaching the Donbas industrial area. However, after this cold punch, the Soviet army gradually reorganized its formation and stubbornly resisted with the tenacity unique to the Russians. In addition, since mid-October, an unprecedentedly severe cold in 140 years descended on the Eastern Front, severely limiting military operations. The Leningrad encirclement battle and the western Moscow battle fell into a stalemate. Even in the south, although the German vanguard troops broke into the key point of Rostov, they eventually retreated due to the Soviet counterattack. On December 7, the German army finally had to stop the offensive. This is the first phase.</p>
<p>Following last March, the Soviet army took advantage of the winter's favorable weather in the Zivun area, western Moscow, the Donbas area, and the Crimean Peninsula, and launched a counteroffensive, recovering several places. In the third phase, the German army began attacking Kerch on May 8 last year. Starting on June 28, it began a concentrated offensive in the south. Unlike the year before, the German army only concentrated its main force on the southern front from west of Kursk to Kharkov and Taganrog to carry out breakthrough operations. The central and northern parts took a defensive stance. The German army, which approached Voronezh and Rostov, was divided into two routes, with one part heading to central Caucasus and the other to Stalingrad on the Volga River. Although the Soviet army knew that mobile warfare was not the enemy of the German army, it stubbornly resisted in the positions, especially the intense battle for Stalingrad, which was unprecedented.</p>
<p>However, nature mercilessly descended again. In early November, the Morstov and Narichi regions in the central Caucasus, where the German army was active, were all white with snow, and the Stalingrad area was also in severe cold. On November 19, the Soviet army, preparing for the second winter counteroffensive, began operations simultaneously from Stalingrad, the middle reaches of the Don River, and the Voronezh area. Furthermore, since the end of December, they launched a counteroffensive in the Morstok and Narichi areas. Therefore, by February of this year, the German army eventually withdrew from Stalingrad, Rostov, Voronezh, Kursk, and the North Caucasus. However, in early March, the German army retook Kharkov, creating a major obstacle to the Soviet army's Ukrainian penetration operation. In the remaining northern and central front lines, the Soviet army also engaged in counterattacks, and the German army in Velikiye Luki and Vyazma was forced to retreat. In this way, the second Soviet counteroffensive of considerable scale ended in March. After that, the formations of the German and Soviet armies were intertwined and extremely complex, showing a stalemate to this day.</p>
<p>During this period, the local battles in the Kupyansk area and the increasingly fierce retaliatory bombings by the German and Soviet air forces became more and more intense. The German Air Force's long-range bombing of Gorky, Yaroslavl, and Saratov aimed to destroy the source of the Soviet Union's ability to cultivate war power, while ensuring the Kupyansk area, which still put great pressure on the Caucasus. In any case, in the past two years, the German and Soviet armies have learned each other's strengths and weaknesses. Locally, each battle was a blitzkrieg, but globally, it was divided into four phases. However, the strategic initiative that the German army gained at the beginning of the war remains unchanged to this day, constantly putting pressure on the Soviet Union.

<p>Founding Declaration</p>
<p>Cultural undertakings are vital to the nation. The rise and fall of a nation's or an era's culture are often causally linked to the prosperity and decline of national fortunes. The publishing industry is an important link in the cultural enterprise. The quantity of publications is often taken as a measure of cultural prosperity. The quantity and quality of our country's publications, compared with those of the world's powers, are already dwarfed in comparison. Since the Incident, with the outbreak of war, it has suffered a further setback. The existing periodicals, with varying lengths of publication history, have persevered in a difficult environment, holding fast to the cultural bastion, and striving to do their part in this great era. The goals of their efforts are the same. Since the cooperation between China and Japan in the war, the national policy has been set, and the wartime cultural policy has been followed accordingly. The Shanghai magazine community, aware of the great responsibility of Shanghai as the center of the national cultural enterprise in revitalizing culture, and the difficulties of wartime material supply to be overcome, believes that only with concerted efforts and methodical steps can the best and greatest efforts be made. Thus, the organization of the Shanghai Magazine Federation is formally established today, vowing to uphold national policy, develop publishing culture, promote the national spirit, cultivate culture, instill academic thought, and overcome the material difficulties encountered at present under the leadership of the authorities, hoping to contribute to the country and the nation. This is hereby declared.</p>
<h3>Grandson Strangles Grandmother - Heinous Crime of Inhumanity - Zheng Yongkang, Addicted to Gambling, Commits Evil Act After Failing to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Zheng Wu, an 81-year-old Ningbo woman, lived in a street-level building at 137 Rue Poncet in the French Concession. Her son had died, and she had two grandsons, the elder named Yongkang, 23 years old, and the younger named Chenggen, 13 years old. The three of them lived together in extreme poverty. Yongkang did not engage in honest labor and was addicted to gambling all day long. His younger brother, Chenggen, although young, knew to love himself and worked as a vendor at the Taiping Bridge vegetable market every day to earn a small profit to support his grandmother's expenses. On the morning of the [26th], around 11 AM, Yongkang again tried to extort money from his grandmother but failed. He noticed that she was wearing two gold rings on her finger, and an evil thought arose in him. After an argument, Yongkang took a mourning cloth and strangled her, taking the two gold rings. He placed the deceased on the bed, covered her with a quilt, closed the door, and fled without a trace. Not long after, Chenggen returned home and found the door locked. After knocking for a long time without a response, he managed to open the door and break in, finding his grandmother lying motionless on the bed, already dead. He saw a mourning cloth wrapped around her neck. He reported it to the police station with the neighbors. They are now searching for the rebellious grandson Yongkang to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Shanghai Magazine Federation</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Magazine Federation" was formally established yesterday. This is another sign that the country's culture will have new developments.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's various magazine publishers had little mutual contact and even less unified organization, which inevitably led to many difficulties. The most obvious examples are:</p>
<p>(1) Various magazines have their own unique characteristics, but it is often found that some magazines publish texts with similar content or translations from the same original text. This duplication is a waste of both mental and material resources.</p>
<p>(2) Because the individual strength of each magazine publisher is weak, it is difficult to purchase sufficient reference materials. Also, because each magazine has few connected writers, it is often difficult to find suitable selectors for ideal topics. This is one of the reasons why the content of each magazine fails to meet the pre-planned goals and reach the ideal state.</p>
<p>(3) Recently, changes in the material environment have brought new challenges to magazines. For example, the repeated rise in paper prices has caused some magazines to reduce their size. There are also those who find it difficult to continue. Furthermore, the increase in advertising costs makes it impossible for magazines with economic difficulties to publish advertisements after publication, making them widely known in society. This is a crisis for the future of the cultural world, not just a misfortune for the magazines themselves.</p>
<p>Now that the "Magazine Federation" has been established, the above three points should be able to find reasonable solutions.</p>
<p>(1) After the establishment of the association, the various magazine publishers can have regular contact and consult on the content of the material at any time to avoid similarities or duplication, and make each strive to develop its unique personality. Supply readers with all aspects of spiritual food.</p>
<p>(2) The exchange of reference materials and the contact with authors will help each other, so that the content of each magazine will be more enriched and perfect.</p>
<p>(3) In the name of the federation, it will be more effective to request fair and equal allocation of paper at fair prices and preferential treatment for cultural advertising from the relevant authorities, thereby reducing the material burden on each magazine publisher and allowing it to continue to develop.</p>
<p>Finally, the poverty of cultural people is still , which is also a major reason why the cultural enterprise is declining. Therefore, how to seek the livelihood and welfare of the heads of various magazine publishers (especially editors, etc.) and various authors is also an urgent problem to be solved.</p>
<p>What is even more appropriate is that the organization of the "Magazine Federation" is mainly to "study the development of periodical publishing and give full play to the cultural mission and sexual power of the periodical enterprise"; however, the revitalization of a country's culture, in addition to the publication of magazines, obviously depends more on the joint efforts of the national cultural community. Therefore, we very much hope that general cultural organizations like "Cultural Associations" can be established in the shortest possible time. Jointly plan the national cultural enterprise, adjust cultural activities, and develop the cultural future.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of culture is a major force that determines the national spirit and knowledge. Therefore, we not only hope that the "Magazine Federation" and the future organizations such as the "Association of Cultural People" (assuming each title) will stand on their positions and engage in practical work that is conducive to cultural development. We also hope that the relevant authorities and the entire group of compatriots will urge, guide, and support them!</p>
<h3>North China Emergency Relief Charity Football Match - Donghua and Lianyi Meet Today - 5:30 PM at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The Charity Football Match for the North China Emergency Relief, co-sponsored by the Municipal Sports Association and co-organized by Donghua and Lianyi, will be held today at 5:30 PM at Yiyuan Stadium. Tickets are priced at 20 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Mayor Chen will be invited to host the opening ceremony. During the match, charity footballs will be auctioned, and all proceeds will be used for relief purposes (expenses will be borne by the Donghua and Lianyi sports associations). The referee will be Deng Xiaoliang. The Cha Football Team is the best in China and both teams are like two Zhuge Liang's of their time. In the first round of the Western League, the two teams drew 0-0, and in the Zhou Renfu Yuan Cup charity match, Donghua won the first match, and Lianyi bravely won the second match. Each team has won one game and the results are balanced. This time, they are fighting for the top spot of the China's Crown. Chen, an official from the North China Emergency Relief Association, will attend to deliver a thank-you speech. The team lists are recorded.</p>

<h3>Searching for Huang Jiaqi</h3>
<p>Huang Jiaqi, 23 years old, is from Rufu, Jiangsu. He is a student at the Police Training Institute of the Xuzhou Suhuai Special Zone Public Security Office. He graduated last month. The institute organized a police inspection team of more than forty people to observe in the Central China area. When they arrived in Shanghai, the students asked him to go to the city to exchange reserve certificates, but he did not return. This happened on June 1st. At that time, letters and telegrams were sent to relatives and friends in various places, but he was not found. His father, who works as a county magistrate in Beijing, is worried. Please inform the family of his whereabouts by sending it to President Ling of the Xin Beijing News in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Director-General Tang of the Business Consolidation Council Warns Colleagues to Practice Self-Discipline</h3>
<p>(Business Consolidation Council News) Director-General Tang of the Business Consolidation Council, in response to an article published in the Shen Bao Economic World titled "Eliminating the Tendency to Seek Private Gain," which was critical of the council, personally issued a warning to lower-level agencies and all staff to practice self-discipline. The original text, "Eliminating the Tendency to Seek Private Gain," published in the Shen Bao Economic World on June 23rd, is quoted below. As the council is a commercial collective, it values the spirit of self-governance, and the duties of the office are heavy. Any behavior that seeks private gain not only abandons oneself to society but also goes against national policy and should be severely punished. Newspaper criticisms should not be taken as absolute truth, and criticisms should be taken as warnings. In addition to announcing to the public and merchants to report at any time, the previous intention should be reiterated and notified to the various professional committees, joint associations, and all colleagues of the council. "Please take note and cherish yourselves, do not ruin the reputation of the council, do not violate the law, and be cautious."</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>"Implementing Material Control and Strengthening Transportation"</h3>
<p>In order to establish a wartime economic system, the government strengthened the National Economic Council, placing it under the jurisdiction of the National Government, making it the highest planning agency for wartime economics after the war. It has held two meetings. In addition to increasing industrial and agricultural production, the second meeting paid special attention to "implementing material control and strengthening transportation." This is one of the wartime economic policies and should be given special attention. Since the establishment of the Commercial Consolidation Council, three months have passed, and the time and economic costs cannot be said to be small. However, in terms of work, it has only been busy with the organization of institutions and the payment of personnel. The material control itself has not been carried out in the entire work. Agricultural products in the interior are not easily transported to industrial areas, and manufactured products in industrial areas are difficult to transport to various places, forming a situation of obstruction. There are many reasons for the difficulty, and the imperfect coordination of various agencies and the improper handling of personnel are the main reasons. The impact on the entire economic infrastructure is huge. Government authorities have received reports from various parties and cannot but feel regret. Therefore, the second National Economic Council included the proposal to "implement material control and strengthen transportation." The intention is far-reaching and profound. It is hoped that the colleagues of the Commercial Consolidation Council and various trade associations will uphold this intention, take immediate action, and strive to complete the work within the entire wartime system. At the same time, all transportation agencies and governments at all levels must understand the difficulty of economic construction plans, cooperate to the best of their ability, and work together to promote transportation and implement material control.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Shenbao Cup Basketball Tournament: Chinese Youth Wins the Shenbao Cup; Western Youth Defeats Chinese Youth 31-21 Yesterday; Cambridge Elder Spends $40,000 to Purchase Charity Ball at High Price</h3>
<p>The "Shenbao Cup North China Disaster Relief Basketball Tournament," jointly organized by the Chinese YMCA and this newspaper, successfully concluded last night amidst enthusiastic atmosphere and smooth progress. The achievements of this charity match are highly commendable. The charity ball auction alone has generated a total of $94,000. Adding donations and ticket sales, the total should be around $150,000. However, detailed figures still need to be carefully calculated and will be announced soon. Last night was the final game of the tournament, and it was already sold out before 7 o'clock. The audience was as large as the previous two nights. After two defeats, Western Youth fought hard yesterday like cornered beasts, ultimately winning with the saying "an army driven by grief is sure to win". They repeatedly took the lead during the process. As the championship was already secured, Chinese Youth did not push too hard and, prioritizing courtesy, allowed Western Youth to win the final victory with a score of 31-21. However, the first half ended in a 17-17 tie, demonstrating the intensity of the battle. In the overall score of two wins to one, Chinese Youth won the Shenbao Cup silver cup, while Western Youth received a commemorative cup. After the match, Mr. Lin Kanghou presented the awards, and Mr. Chen Bin delivered a thank-you speech, bringing the grand event to a successful conclusion. The charity ball auction last night was even more exciting and enthusiastic, with the bidding reaching a fever pitch. In the end, after fundraising by Lin Kanghou, the ball was purchased by a Cambridge elder for the huge sum of $40,000. The charity basketball fees over the past few days have repeatedly reached new heights, especially the $40,000 last night, which was unprecedented and broke all charity ball (including football) records in the city. Benefiting the disaster victims, doing good is the greatest joy, and their kindness is truly admirable. When time was up, after referees Liu Hesheng and Yu Julu blew their whistles, the two teams began to engage. Chinese Youth's fierce attack was unsuccessful, and Lin Weicong and Zhuo Guorong subsequently committed fouls. Tao Bolinji scored two free throws, taking an early lead of two points. Soon after, Lin Weicong made a shot from the side, tying the score at two each. However, due to a slight lapse in defense, Tao Bolinji scored three more consecutive points. Xiao Lin dribbled under the basket, and Yu Xunzi made a successful free throw, finally closing the gap to 5-8. However, Kaiqi made a brilliant long shot, making it 10-5. Chinese Youth fought hard, and Ma and Yu each made a shot, with Cheng making one free throw, eventually tying the score at 10 each. Then, Tao Bolinji made a long shot, once again taking the lead. Ma, Yu, and Wu each made three shots, suddenly taking a 16-12 lead, coming from behind. After 17-14, Tao Bolinji and Fonik's one free throw and one shot tied the score at 17 each, ending the first half.</p>
<p>Western Youth Succeeds in Physical Play in the Second Half</p>
<p>As the second half began, the four youths fought desperately. Fonik, Yelong B. Saszkin, and others made consecutive shots, adding seven points. Chinese Youth struggled to support, with only Ma Canxi and Tang Xuesheng each making one free throw at 21-17 and 25-18. Afterwards, Fonik probed the basket and made two more free throws, and Monroe Tuo made one shot, suddenly increasing the score to 31. Chinese Youth adjusted their lineup but still showed no improvement. Their luck was also poor, and they repeatedly missed shots. Ma Canxi made a long shot successfully. Then, the gong sounded, ending the game with a final score of 31-21. Western Youth reported their victory.</p>
<p>The scores of the two teams yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>Western Youth</p>
<p>Shots  Free Throws  Fouls  Points</p>
<p>Fonik 3 4 2 11</p>

<h3>List of Donors to the Shenbao Cup Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The following is the list of donors to the Shenbao Cup North China Disaster Relief received by this newspaper yesterday:</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Huikang, $23,000.</p>
<p>The following seven entities, each $1,000: Shaye Bank, Dazhong Insurance Company, Guangzhiliang, Chuan Xiangcheng, Wu Yunfu, Shanghai District Dim Sum Restaurant Association, Shao Shuhua of Central Reserve Bank, and Wu Kunsheng of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, Jiang Zhaozu of Chengfeng Enterprise Company. Wu Shaoting of Fuhua Bank, $600. Yang Fuchen, Jin Hongxiang, Zhu Qinpei of Zhengming Bank, He Shen, Chongqing Bank, Zhang Weiru, anonymous donor, Yang Yinsun, Wu Ruiyuan, Shi Xiaoshan, Timber Industry Association, Xu Baohua, Central Asia Bank, China Tobacco Bank, Xu Yongxiang, Jiangsu Local Banking Industry First, Wu Limen, Zhou Xingchu, Yida Motor Company, (fundraising by Zhou) Ge Yongqi, each $400. Zhang Yuqing, Cai Songfu, Wei Tuanxiang (fundraising by Zhou), each $200. Total received: $38,200 in reserve coupons. Remaining balance: $106,300.</p>
<p>Lower-level organizations have long encouraged each other with the words "fairness, integrity, and impartiality." Because this association is a commercial collective, it still emphasizes the spirit of self-governance. However, the matter concerns the overall duties and responsibilities. If there is any act of personal gain or profiteering, it is not only a self-abandonment to society but also a far cry from national policy and should be subject to strict sanctions. Although newspaper criticisms are not to be blindly believed, and public opinion deserves attention, it is important to be vigilant. In addition to publicly encouraging social merchants to report cases at any time based on evidence, we should reiterate the previous intentions and notify all types of specialized committees, joint committees, and all colleagues of this association to "exercise self-respect, avoid tarnishing the association's reputation, violating laws and regulations, and to act cautiously."</p>
<h3>Measures for Rice Transportation in the Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>(Business Control Committee News) For the transportation of rice outside the controlled area in the Shanghai region, transportation is based on permits issued by the Ministry of Food. If the rice is transported into the Shanghai controlled area from foreign countries, it must be based on the "Provisional Regulations on the Prohibition of Movement of Wartime Materials." Except for glutinous rice, it must obtain the permission of the Business Control Committee and issue a transportation permit before it can be transported in. At the same time, all applications for the issuance of rice transportation permits must be based on the permits issued by the Ministry of Food.</p>
<h3>Application Procedures for the Transportation of Flour, Wheat, etc.</h3>
<p>(Business Control Committee News) For applications for the transportation of wheat flour and bran by both Chinese and Japanese merchants, the Business Control Committee requires that they first be certified and stamped by the Joint Association of Chinese and Japanese Flour Industries and Miscellaneous Grain Industries. It should be noted that, for the sake of contacting and registering the flour and wheat professional committee, the application must be submitted to the committee for stamping and certification in order to conduct joint review. It is now known that, for the convenience of the procedures, it has been stipulated that all applications for the transportation of the above three items, in addition to following the original procedures, must also hold the application and other documents and first register with the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, which will stamp and certify it. Then, the Permit Affairs Group will accept it and, according to the procedure, review and approve the issuance of the transportation permit (or the transfer approval letter). However, if it is not approved, the Permit Affairs Group will notify the committee at any time for contact.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Internal Organization of the Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative</h3>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Procedures for Transporting Old Cotton, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the procedures for transporting old cotton and old rubber hemp, etc., there is a lack of clarity in the outside world. The Business Control Committee has provided the following clarification: Cotton, regardless of whether it is new or old, must be transported to the Shanghai area (i.e., within the controlled area surrounding Shanghai), regardless of whether it is from nearby villages or from the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line or from Tongning and Shaoxing. The carrier must apply for permission from the Materials Movement Permit Office of the Business Control Committee before it can be transported in. As for movement within the city, currently, only yarn mills are allowed to apply for permits for self-use. Regarding the transportation of old rubber glands and other similar goods to the domestic area, it is not necessary to obtain permission from the committee.</p>

<h3>Assorted Rights and Wrongs</h3>
<p>— Qingzhao</p>
<p>If history does not give people lessons but is merely a record of the surface of facts, then it has no value.</p>
<p>Exposing the true face of things is the primary task of historians. Historians only call things by their true names and do not worship the status quo. Therefore, the personal fate of true historians is often tragic, such as the Grand Historian Sima Qian in ancient China.</p>
<p>"The art of exposure is the art of recognition."</p>
<p>God grants people truth in their dreams. Hegel refuted this by saying that whatever is obtained in dreams is mostly nonsense.</p>
<p>Intelligent people are not incarnations of "infallibility." The characteristic of intelligent people can be said to be the ability to thoroughly correct their mistakes and the courage and determination to accept the lessons of facts.</p>
<p>The incarnation of "infallibility" is not a human being but God (?)</p>
<p>However, people still want to seek the incarnation of "infallibility," and this incarnation is best belonging to himself. Balzac then said:</p>
<p>When you are worshiped like a god, you cannot see your own good or bad.</p>
<h3>Teachers During the Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>— Lu Shenting</p>
<p>Summer vacation has arrived, and it is time for teachers who have worked hard for a year to rest. People outside the education field seem to envy the good fortune of being a teacher. Being able to have two months of long summer vacation, but they don't know that teachers are getting panicked. Some are so anxious when grading papers that sweat beads even drip from their noses. They are worrying about the "renewal of their contracts" for the next semester and the "summer salary" during the vacation!</p>
<p>In China, where the situation of teachers is not guaranteed, the private school principals who have become bosses are thinking, "Where did these come from...? Might as well take this opportunity to clean and refresh the teachers. It's better to save a sum of money for the summer salary paid to the teachers."</p>
<p>There are also teachers who are so good that the students don't want them to leave, and the principal has no choice but to reluctantly maintain their positions. Teachers who can get half of their salary are considered very lucky. Clever principals simply open summer tutoring schools and have the teachers stand in the steamy classrooms to strain their voices. As a result, not only can this summer salary be squeezed from the teachers, but they can also profit from it themselves.</p>
<p>The devil is always one foot higher than the saint, and the amount of summer salary that teachers get can't keep up with the ever-increasing cost of living. They can't even "eat" properly, and they can't even think about "dressing" nicely. "Family and children" are even further out of reach. This ironclad fact doesn't need a single word to prove. In short, under these circumstances, it is difficult to prevent teachers from thinking about "jumping out of the education field to make a living," which leads to an education crisis!</p>
<p>This is a basic argument: The purpose of education is to turn students into good citizens in the future. Therefore, students must first receive a good education. To enable students to receive a good education, teachers must first be able to teach with peace of mind. Therefore, teachers must first have a stable life. To enable teachers to have a stable life, of course, is to "raise their salaries"!</p>
<p>But now, teachers not only dare not dream of "raising their salaries" but are also afraid of the "threat of summer vacation"! This is really unfair.</p>
<p>The relationship between education and society is extremely close, and we should not stand idly by and watch primary school teachers worry. I feel that there is an opportunity right in front of us that can make them feel a little more at ease, and that is to ask the principals to give the right to run summer schools to the teachers, so that the teachers can directly collect tuition fees. If this is done, not only will it consolidate the possibility of teachers continuing in the next semester, but it will also enable them to earn some extra profits. Naturally, the threat of the two-month summer vacation will no longer be long. (Move to North China disaster relief)</p>
<h3>Whetstone</h3>
<p>— Yu Wenzhong</p>
<p>If we use the environment as a metaphor for a whetstone, then everyone is a knife.</p>
<p>We all believe that it is very difficult to sharpen a knife on a smooth marble stone, but it is not absolutely impossible. As long as you abandon the prejudice that "marble is smooth" and spend time and energy to grind it patiently, excellent conditions often make people lack the ambition to move upward, but I believe that if you are not satisfied with the perfection of the situation and still strive to improve, you will not be difficult to become a useful person in the future. Otherwise, you will be mistaken by the comfortable environment and bury your precious future!</p>
<p>A "relatively rough" whetstone is best for sharpening knives. Indeed, a "relatively bad" environment easily tempers people to be determined and capable. Friend—if you are in distress and lonely suffering; subjected to all kinds of hardships and setbacks; then I congratulate you, please don't think of "misfortune as disaster", and use a sincere heart to celebrate your acquisition of a whetstone. That blunt knife? It is yourself, there is a great possibility of being sharpened! I will not list the great people from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad, who have struggled out of hardship, so as not to waste words.</p>
<p>As for wanting to sharpen a knife quickly on a stone with an uneven surface, the possibility is very small, and even a useful knife will be damaged or chipped. We believe that there are talented people in science, literature...etc., among the poor children, who can be made to achieve great things in the future, but unfortunately they die prematurely or remain unknown throughout their lives. This is not only a grievance for them personally, but also a loss for the country and society. In order to preserve this batch of useful knives, we must find ways to flatten those stones!</p>
<h3>Talking About "Laughter"</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>The progress of the world is based on "laughter." If a "person" is dissatisfied with the reality of society and recognizes the flaws in society, a foolish person may "grieve" and issue a cry of despair, or be "angry" and "look askance" at society, which is in an extremely bad state. But these are all expressions of not seeking improvement. Therefore, only those who "laugh" are intelligent reformers. Only "laughter" can most powerfully and peacefully recognize the deepest parts of real society. The highest art of "laughter" is to deal with facts that should be "grieved" and "angered," not by "laughing it off" but by being able to "deal with it while laughing." On the one hand, "laughing" elegantly, and on the other hand, being able to rigorously, correctly, and deeply correct the simplicity, humor, contradiction, evil, disunity, shortcomings, unreasonableness...of reality until it is "no longer laughable."</p>
<p>But unfortunately, because the "laughter" of many people is only a full "haha" and nothing more. Once the haha is over, it's over. Big dissatisfaction is haha, and small dissatisfaction is also haha. The power of laughter is completely relaxed. What benefit is this to real society? Therefore, a person who truly has the art of laughter does not easily "haha." If he laughs, it also indicates that he has truly seen the flaws.</p>
<p>So we need people who can truly "laugh"!</p>
<h3>Friendship</h3>
<p>— Keshi</p>
<p>Nietzsche said, "Are you a slave? Then you cannot be a friend to others. Are you a tyrant? Then you cannot have friends." Then what kind of people cannot have friends or be friends to others? According to the above, we can say that slaves and tyrants cannot be friends to others. In other words, friendship is built on a completely equal class, not on the foundation of begging or military oppression. Trying wholeheartedly to use flattery to seek the other's pleasure, or using money to bribe, benefits to lure, or even using military force to threaten, in order to obtain the other's friendship is not true friendship.</p>
<p>"The friendship between gentlemen is as light as water, the friendship between villains is as sweet as honey." This is the most accurate description of friendship. The former is true friendship, eternal friendship, while the latter is momentary and hypocritical. In the initial acquaintance, they often express a situation of regretting meeting so late, as if only the two of them in the world are worthy of having friendship. If a third party intervenes, jealousy or rivalry will occur. But once a conflict arises over certain interests, the past friendship between the two will immediately vanish like a bubble, becoming like strangers on the road.</p>
<p>Friendship - the only thornless rose in the world, we should always preserve, cherish and protect it, just like the Malagasy proverb, "May your friendship be like the mouth and the hand, when the hand hurts, use the mouth to blow it, when the mouth hurts, use the hand to soothe it."</p>
<h3>Good and Evil</h3>
<p>— Fang Hao</p>
<p>In this diverse real world, I believe that evil has already blinded the people. Although from the outside, this society is still singing and dancing, prosperous and very; but, if we can carefully observe the inside story; then, we must believe that even the world's greatest literary talents, with all their students' energy, would not be able to reveal all the base and filthy situations without any disguise to the world.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "Human nature is inherently good." However, Xunzi said: "Human nature is evil, and goodness is artificial." Regardless of whether Mencius said that human nature is inherently good or Xunzi said that goodness is artificial; they both advised people to do good. Since everyone knows that doing good is right and doing evil is bad behavior, why are so many people afraid of not doing evil quickly enough? Is it "people's hearts are not as they used to be"? Is it "the world is going downhill"? Neither. I say this is entirely due to the environment.</p>
<p>When young people enter the world deeply and their ambitions are not yet determined, they are very easily seduced by the outside world and lose their nature, blindly following the crowd towards the abyss of (happiness?). In the end, they are unable to extricate themselves from the depths of water and fire. By the time they discover that destruction is imminent, it is too late to "regret" it. Like us, young people with strong blood, how can we not walk cautiously?</p>
<p>Dr. Bauke said: "Kindness is the most beautiful virtue of mankind, and it is the foundation for obtaining happiness." This sentence is accurate. Don't we also have two proverbs? That is, "Harmony brings wealth" and "A harmonious family prospers in everything." It can be seen that goodness is the foundation of being a person. If you abandon the foundation and pursue the superficial, spending all day doing evil, the result is truly unimaginable!</p>
<p>Madame Flora Tristan said, "What is called goodness is not simply avoiding the penalty of doing evil. Goodness is not passive and passive. Goodness is active and automatic."</p>
<p>This is the division between good and evil.</p>
<h3>Collection of White Grass</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Menglei</p>
<p>People who have tomorrow do not fear sorrow, even if they endure pain and torture today. Those who truly have "love" for humanity and are willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of others must eventually walk on the path to truth, regardless of where they start.</p>
<p>"Love" can forgive, while "selfishness" cannot.</p>
<p>Words that have not been thought about, chewed on, and digested often cause all kinds of misfortunes and regrets after being spoken.</p>

<h3>Abbot of Sanmei Temple Donates to Charity</h3>
<p>Kuan Dao, the abbot of Sanmei Temple in the South City, wrote yesterday stating: "Kuan Dao has been a monk for twenty years and has never solicited alms. However, considering the hunger and suffering of monks and nuns in famous mountains and forests after the Incident, as fellow disciples, I could not bear to sit idly by. Therefore, I made a vow to lecture on scriptures and raise donations for three years, to do my best. This year is the last year to complete the anticipated total of 300,000 yuan. In addition to the donations for food relief in various places, and Buddhist porridge distribution and medical care in North China, which have already been sent separately, there is still 500 yuan for the Catholic Xin Pu Yu Tang, 500 yuan for the Orphanage. 300 yuan for a certain Christian Refugee Orphanage, and 100 yuan each for the Nursery, Fu You Academy, and the Mountain Bay Orphanage. 1,000 yuan for the Shen Bao scholarship, please transfer it on behalf of your newspaper." Note: The funds have been received. It is particularly commendable for a monk to donate to charity. It is hoped that all sectors will rise up and support it.</p>
