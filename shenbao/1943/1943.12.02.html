<p>社評</p>
<h3>交通</h3>
<p>交通事業無本身之目的，其目的在减少人與物地點移動之困雖以及節省八與物地點移動之時間，以期人力之效率增加與夫物資之流動暢達。在平時如此，在戰時尤常如此。故交通事業在任何時期中，允爲各種事業之工具，亦爲各種事業之基本因素。</p>
<p>由此可知交通事業應具備之條件，就客運貨運一般言之，有如下各點：　出發及到達之時間準確。　使用一切合理化之方法使遝費低廉。　設法增加速度以減少全程時間。　按實際之需要以定駛行之次數以及每次容納量之多寡。　設備宜力求相常周密，俾能於安全舒適之要求達到最低之水準。遠程交通如此，近程交通亦復如此。故交通事業之成績，在平時足以覘國家之隆替，在戰時可以測前途之勝敗，古今中外莫不　然。</p>
<p>就今之鐵道言之，時問之準確倘可差强人意，而定價之公允亦無可厚非，但車票之有黑市，購票之困難，登車之不易，搜查之雜亂煩複，車廂中之擁擠，在在令人厭惡而大惑不解。固有不肖之徒，造成此顚倒之局面而遂其混水撈魚之企圖，何鐵道之主體竟無廓淸之斷然處置，以求完遂其使命。</p>
<p>就城市之公用交通言之，其零亂混沌之狀熊，實足令人咋舌。司機及售票人員之傲慢，停車之不按站驛，車價之參差不齊，車輛之頻數不等，一切現象充分表示公用交通無意爲大衆服務，而欲使大衆難堪者。在各該主管機構固未能辭其咎，而負督察之責老亦竟視若無覩。</p>
<p>就街道之一般交通言之，似應毫無問題，乃朝暮有斷絕之可能，東西有阻隔之可虞。叩其原因非外賓通過即要人光臨。言之亦似成理，忖之實足以自慚於無地。蓋治安未奠，始慮暴襲，民意信孚，豈好犯上。若謂僅與體面攸關，聊事點綴，則宜盡量縮小戒備之區城，盡量减少戒備之時間，姑卑無高論，亦至少可使爲衣食奔忙之小民，不致時有進退維谷之感！</p>
<p>此外在各區各要之點，設崗檢問，此於非常時期，固屬必要。但亦應有嚴肅之規律，明白之禁條，使人有所適徒，而截獲處罰亦皆有根據。否則在人民耗時廢錢，在政府則自隋威信。此不特有礙交通，亦且有玷吏治。</p>
<p>由精神萎靡而交通腐敗，馴而至百業銷沉。如此其何以言增進生產充實國力，更何以言負起東亞盟邦之使命？願朝野人士，三復思之！</p>
<h3>吉爾貝特島東方第四次海面空戰　日大本營發表沉毀四敵艦</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本　一日下午三時發表：帝國海軍航空部隊，十一月二十九日傍晚，在吉爾員特羣島東方海面，攻擊敵機動部隊，所獲戰果如次：擊沉航空母艦二艘（一艘轟沉）艦種不詳者一艘，擊毀大型巡洋艦一艘（重創起火），我方飛機架返。（註）此次空戰，稱第四次吉爾貝特島海面空戰。</p>
<p>東京一日中央電　現吉爾貝特羣島方面戰况愈形熾烈，日海軍各部隊餘擊沉，擊毀敵大型巡洋艦二艘運輸船一艘外，更擴大戰果，擊沉擊毀敵艦艇數艘（內擊沉敵航空母艦一艘），日大本營預定一日下午發表該戰果之詳報。</p>
<p>東京一日中央電　日海軍航空部隊及潛艇，自十一月十九日迄第四次吉爾貝特羣島海面空　，所獲綜合戰果（包括陸上部隊之對空戰果）如次：立即擊沉敵航空母艦四艘，巡洋艦一艘驅逐艦一艘，共計六艘。擊沉敵航空母艦三艘，巡洋艦二艘，艦形不明者一艘，共計六艘。擊毀敵航空母艦四艘，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦或戰艦一艘，大型巡洋艦（受重創起火）一艘，巡洋艦一艘，運輸船二艘，共計十艘，擊落敵機百二十五架。日方損失飛機二十七架。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營一日發表，日海軍航空隊二十九日在吉爾貝特羣島海面，擊沉敵航空母艦二艘，艦型不明者一艘，擊毀大型巡洋艦一艘，此距美國航空母艦集團出現於吉爾貝特羣島海域之十一月十九日晨，為時僅十一日，日海軍航空隊擊沈或重創敵航空母艦十一艘，並使損失其他艦船十一艘，獲得驚人戰果，尤堪注目者，即在擊沉擊毀敵艦總數之二十二艘中，航空母艦佔其半數。在此連日海空戰中敵方損失如此多數航空母艦，可謂任何戰史上難有其例，觀於上述數字，已明繚敵此次反攻吉爾貝特羣島，實係以航空母艦集團為中心之作戰，又係新建航空母艦作中心之再度反攻，故其意義極大。且去年八月以來，迄昨年杪，在所羅門海域之歴次海戰，敵已採用航空母艦中心主義，但當時係航空母艦與艦隊之平行，協同作戰，與此次之航空母艦中心作戰完全本質不同。其次為年初以來迄至六月三十日之敵軍在倫特巴島登陸，十月二十七日在摩麟島登陸等，敵曾採用基地航空隊中心主義，但於來諾易登陣以後。即將航空母艦作戰與基地航空隊作戰併合。而此次吉爾貝特羣島方面之新反攻作戰，敵　其　大之航空母艦集團前來攻擊，關係完全採用航空母艦中心戰法，敵軍在日軍掌握制空權之海域　　遺此種大規模之航空母艦集團前來攻擊，徒見其肓動失策而已。然從另一方面觀之，敵軍之反攻企圖，基積極實為前所空見，同時說明航空兵力在近代戰中所作之重要地位，觀敵方傾注全力以建造航空母艦，其或尚擇有制式母艦及補助母艦約數十艘之多，故敵之戰鬥力量，尚有充份餘裕，決不容輕視。</p>
<p>美海長諾克斯猶圖掩飾損害</p>
<p>阿根廷京　一日中央社電　據華盛頓整來電稱：美海長諾克斯三十日會免卻老團時，復霄及美軍於吉爾貝特獷鳥登讖作戰所受攝害接大，又為掩飾起見，故共答詞楊為模稜。彼曾講：吉爾貝特羣島之聲陸作戰，乃一異常之苦戰，又因恐發表受損害之具體數字，再予美國民以重大之打擊，故以「尙未接到具體報告」之詞，而奪掩飾。記者團又詢共美軍何故苦戰，彼又辯稱：美軍並未興說吉爾貝特亂島，尢其達拉瓦島之日軍戰力，故贊登陸前即以飛機徹底縣燦日軍陣地，及於縈始登陸時，復由艙鰍對之實行猛擊，然登陸軍聳開始登陸詩，因海上情形突超，致有多數舟艇均行擱淺。遂遭日軍猛射，因此遭受損害之重大，實出意外。</p>
<h3>敵機連續空襲威瓦克布茲</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　據南太平洋日單某慕牠電二一十七日裊九時餘，瀆有敵口翁劉機·及戰鬥機各五十架，來襲威瓦克、被日軍陝上砲火勵落中二架，日方根失極縱徹。二十八日晨復有敵B24皴機二十五架。友P38犁機數架，來襲布　（威瓦克馬當之間），翱姘彼日軍陸上彬火擊落目谿藥機四架，日方無損害，又二十八日晨有敵B24型機四十架及戰鬥機三十架來襲威瓦克，被陸上砲火擊毀敵B24型機二架，其餘被擊返，日方損害極　微。</p>
<p>南太平洋某基地一日中央社電　南太平徉戰局之中心。飛鐘似以移淡吉爾又參絮鳥方而，然彼根緲爾鳥方而刻約申敵雙陸部隊繃嘴中。十一月江士九黠，敵軍於巡洋艦，賜逐艙你衛護下。以五十六隻大準舟艇，擬於牡羅基納維迸地區登陸，臼軍地上部隊常即對之襲擎猛攻，是日夜日軍另一部隊道由敵登陸部聳背面施以夾擊，將徹登織部隊完全殲滅。</p>
<h3>尼米資承認作戰困難</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城一日中央社電　據帕爾哈巴電，美大平洋艦隊司令官尼米資，提曾視察吉爾貝特羣島方面前錢，巳於三十日歸返此地。渠承　美軍於該方面作戰之艱苦，據稱：美軍在吉爾貝特羣島已遭　　日軍之痛烈攻擊，其中尤以達拉瓦島之攻擊為最，此誠美軍在太平洋戰區所經過之最困難之戰事。</p>
<h3>日軍某部隊獲得感謝狀</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日海軍省一日午十一時公布：十一月在龍加徉囊夜戰中，以寡兵擊戳優勢敵嬌隊之日水某部隊，頃由聯合艦隊司令長官授與感謝狀。</p>

<h3>美報竟公然主張對日採毒瓦斯戰</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城一日中央社電　波根美軍在維爾島，吉爾貝特島等地屢次大敗後，愈痛　對日作戰之不易，於是期野焦思，謀對日作戰之有效戰備，紐約每日新聞十一月三日之社論中，竟公然主張為攻擊開本，常採用毒瓦斯戰術，其要旨如扶，吾人必須對日本採用彬戴斯戰地，日本至少亦有七千萬人，以美闢之一俄三千五百萬人與之相較，鑰不足常其二借。亞洲及太平洋各島之約二哦入，亦與日本協力同心，共人的資滅實未可輕說，且日軍倘有膏死不絨詼州敵俱亡之精神，故否人如須將大平徉上之雌小島二叢領。則必須數復遭受如達拉泯一役之承大獵失。喬人唯一之方法。為以優秀之武器，向日水心臟部作致命之攻擊，如毒瓦斯可輿日本以致命損害，則吾人當對日本使用毒瓦斯。</p>

<h3>對南太平洋戰役任海長發表談話　盛讚盟邦海空軍赫赫戰果</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　最近日本沒空軍在波根維爾島，及吉爾貝特羣島海面，屢獲　赫戰　。此次吉爾貝特羣島第四次海面空戰、甘軍又獲　人戰績。記者爲此特往訪海軍部長任援道，叩詢意見，當承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>當此大東亞會　完成之時、盟邦海軍在所羅門最前綫波根維爾羣島，及吉爾貝特羣島、先後獲空前之大勝利，其戰果之偉大、較之夏威夷之奇襲，更爲可觀。此可見盟邦海軍眞正之實力，誠非英美所能夢想也。此後美國海軍欲重整陣容，再圖振作，實非易事。藍美海軍自夏威夷受重　以後，以一年有半之時間，所準備調集之艦隊，經　邦海軍以數日之時間，一舉而使其沉於大洋之深淵，此後如欲再舉，其所需之時間，亦可頂測，而其補充之困難，不言可知。</p>
<p>日本海軍之精强　戰、自大東亞戰爭爆發後即已震驚世界、而使敵軍寒心。最迸自玻根維爾鳥海面五次空戰以後，敵美海軍實力，更受極大打擊、尤其戰　及航空母艦，美方共沉毀十四艘之多、連其他艦艇合計共達八十艘、日海軍所獲如此巨大戰果，在世界海軍史上、實屬罕見。美繼統羅斯福及其軍　當局，亦惟恐此種慘敗爲其國民所知，除竭力掩飾外，復設法轉移其國民目標。美軍又於十一月廿一日，在吉貝爾特島方面，企圖蠢動，但至今爲止，美軍又連敗四次，其結果之慘，不下於玻根維爾島方面。</p>
<p>即在前三次吉員特羣島海面航空戰中，敵美航空母艦，臨逐艦，巡洋艦，被擊沉擊投者，又有十四艘。敵機墮落者達百廿五架，其損失之重，犧牲之多，不雖想像。消息傳來，日大本營於一日發表第四次吉貝爾特羣島海面航空戰果，又擊沉敵航空母艦二艘，觀此可知敵軍實力，巳大受打擊，尤其航空母艦，在今日之海空戰中，地位極載要，而且建造改裝，均非容易。美軍如欲補充決非短期可成，即使再圖蠢動，欲覓機出擊陰謀，將再遭日海軍之痛擊。吾人於欽佩日海軍忠勇　戰之餘，尤盼更偉大之戰果再繼續傳來。</p>
<h3>常德攻防戰　已入最後階段　日軍突入北門及東門</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍委會三十日發表戰况公報稱：常德攻防戰現巳八於最後階段，日軍自二十九日拂曉，在空軍及砲兵協力下，開始總攻擊，下午四時，自北門及東門突入城內。自二十九日夜至三十日上午，仍繼續激戰中，渝軍損害甚大云。</p>
<p>常德城外一日中央社電　常德攻略戰刻正熾烈進行中，且將進入最後之階殷。在小西門四南方及西觀街附近之殘敗渝軍，黔　技窮之餘，曾於一日農數次來襲，但爲甘軍澈底殲減。日軍更次第猛攻，粉碎渝軍陣地，在市街中到處展開手溜彈戰與肉搏戰。同時日軍機隊亦與地上部隊，緊密協力，襲擊沅江之渝軍艇羣，使渝軍無從利用舟艇逃竄。現渝軍戰力，因日軍之陣空猛擊，已極衰退，常德之陷落，僅爲時間問題而已。</p>
<p>漢口一日中央社電　攻八常德北門之日軍，刻正向四北隅追擊渝軍。又日軍挺身隊，已抵達臥沅江杳岔並城壁，將城內戰爲東四兩部。常德市街有三分之二已爲日軍佔據。進抵城內之日軍各部隊，卅日於空軍協力下，開始總攻擊，到處展開激戰，即將完全佔頓常德城云。</p>
<p>漢口一日中央社電　渝方因第六戰區遭日軍猛攻，行將崩潰，由第九戰區陸續向常德方面派遺援軍。其暫編第十師，前曾爲日軍擊漬，現日軍正對開抵薛家舖，五龍山一帶之淪第百九十師等圍攻云。</p>
<p>日軍擊落渝症狀飛機</p>
<p>漢口一日中央社社電　日軍機隊於卅日　，以戰鬥矗炸機聯合大編隊，往襲常德，痛炸城內渝軍及殘存之軍事設施。移時駐淪美空軍會以P40型及P43型機數架迎擊，遂展開空戰。結果擊落其P40型機一架，並重創P43型機一架云。</p>
<p>香港日軍佔橫港墟</p>

<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國新　社　：　聶炸機大編隊於三十日淸晨飛抵德西部上空，其中一隊先佯作襲攻德西南部之狀，另一隊則在戰鬥機保護之下飛越荷蘭，此隊俟戰鬥機撤離後，即改變方由而逕衝入魯爾區，德機當即加以截擊，使不能集中攻擊而驅逐之使西向而飛。於是美機向魯爾區南部擲彈，但不能瞄準正確、故僅有一處遭受損失，民衆略有死傷。據目下所知，敵方轟炸機數架被擊落，此外尙有敵機三架墜毀於荷境。</p>

<h3>戈美爾前綫　攻防戰熾烈　蘇承認退出柯洛斯頓</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍在戈美爾之西與北，進行重大之防禦戰已有多時、星之地點、蘇軍自夏季開始告失敗，故　至少在該區獲得一決定性之勝利、因此繼續以步兵與坦克車增援軍加入作戰、蘇軍利用優越之人力與物質，在若干據點將德軍陣綫擊退數公里，但其突破之企圖則爲德軍頑强之戰鬥與深梯形之防禦所阻。蘇軍在尼繼爾河套之　　淮攻十一次均被擊退。同時德軍　河套之南側面繼續進，以克服蘇軍之頑抗，德軍之防綫大見改進。克里米亞前綫自蘇軍在具萊科普地峽遭受挫折後，雖無重要活動之消息，但紅軍繼續向尼柯波爾橋頭堡及　伯河套進攻，然蘇軍此種猛攻已不如前數日之强大，契爾喀賽之激戰仍在繼續中，但同時基輔以西與柯洛斯頓之情形則比較平靜，該處德軍之局部行動結果大勝，因此德軍能擴展其陣綫。</p>

<h3>社會福利事業要點丁部長對記者談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊　社會福利部量近對於社會福利事業之推行，頗爲積極，中央社記者，昨晋謁了部長，就社會福利部今後工作之要點，以及積極性社會福利與消極性社會福利之分野，暨關於統一籌募福利經費之疑點，叩詢T部長，承逐一解答如次：</p>
<p>發表談話</p>
<p>（間）社會福利部目前推行社會福利之重點如何？（答）社會福利，係社會政策之實行，當此戰時，爲適應事實需要，自應着重戰時社會政策，換言之，即着重於積極性的社會福利。（問）積極性的社會福利與消極性的社會福利，其眞體內容若何？（答）消極性的社會福利，大多偏於救貧卹孤·　老·振災等項，反之積極性的事業，是以促進社會建設，增進國家力量爲前提。舉例言之，如勞工保護及勞工福利，農人保護及農村福利，農工續神及思想之指導，戰業指導與職業介紹，國民體力促進與指導，國民健康促進與指導，優生指導與晉養，指導社會保險及簡易保險義務，勞動之推行，社會節約之促進，母性與兒童之保護，農村義倉之建設，社會生活之改善，平民常議之指導，貧民經濟之扶助等項，均屬積極性的社會福利。此外如遊民孤兒之教養，殘廢老弱之保護，病者行旅之救助，社會服務之推行，戰時雌民之救濟，水　時令及一切災荒之振濟等項，則屬消極性的社會福利。（問）社會福利具體事業，範圍如此廣泛，逐一實施，自需大量經費，未悉貴部對此有何準備？（答）在此戰時，國庫支出繁多，如福利經費，全由國庫負担，自屬困難，倘由民間協力，必易推進。關於此點，本部已制定各省市縣統一籌募社會福利經費要綱，呈經行政院核准施行，在本部設立中央社會羅利經費籌募委員會在各省市設立各地社會福利經費　募委員會，以爲統一籌募經費之專管機構，此後據以進行，當較易籌措。此外並由本部呈請行政院通令各省市政府，暨咨睛財政部通令各省市財政廳局，於明年度地方經費預算中，增加福利事業經費，）此一方由各地士紳就地向民問勸募，一方由地方政府在地方公款內從寬支撥，則今後福利經費，當不患無着也。（問）報載社會福利部公佈私辦福利事業勸募經費規則，對私辦福利事業勸募經費，頗多限制，其目的如何？（答）過去私辦福利事業，自由勸募經資，雖朱能肯定均有流弊，但捐輸者殊盛不勝應付，則屬事實，故特制定此項規則，使認捐及　募，各有依循，以後任何私辦福利事業，勸募經費，仍須於事前向主管社會商利經費籌募委員會申請核准，所有捐册票券，亦須送請蓋印，未經核准及不遵照規　手續辦理，概予取締，但主管機關對私辦福利事業，申請勸募經費時，經過縝密審查，如擬辦事業，確有需要，或已辦事業，確有未竣，當然予以核准，並協助其勸募，較之自由勸募，效力當更宏偉也。（問）現當冬令，　部對各地冬賑，如何指導？（答）冬賬與冬防，關係共爲密切，如冬賬辦理，成緒良好，則冬防亦必圓滿，唯冬賬每年一次，屬經常性的，以地域言，無論何址，均有黑要，故極普遍，經常普遍性之救濟，自應由各地自行主辦，較易週密。復查過去冬賬等籌募經費，極爲紛歧，本年各地，大致已趨統一。辦理放賑，過去官民各自爲政，本年則力圖合作，　免重複，此種步驟，殊可欣慰也。（問）福利部最近公佈國民義務勞動要綱，未悉上海方面如何實施？（答）國民義務勞動亦　積極性者，日德諸國，早已實行，頗著成效。我國過去在軍事期問，亦常有徵用義務勞力之例，故在我國，亦非創舉。此次普遍推行，其目的在適應戰時體制，强制勞動，增進國力，井養成一般國民之勤勞習慣，健强體格，服務觀念，與刻苦精神，在推行之初，先選定區域，以作實騐，憂國則指定南京爲實騐區，各省以省會爲實騐區，上海之實騐區，與市府接洽，苒行決定，大概以南巿或浦束，比較相宜也。</p>

<h3>歡迎山本次官　—在聯合茶會席上致詞—</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>今天上海五個民間團體聯合歡迎日本大東亞省山本次官，本人略　意見數點：</p>
<p>我於上月往日本觀光、踏入日本國境，最先感至者、即是甘本朝野，都爲了解放大東亞而一致認眞對敵作戰，我們今天也在參戰、無論朝野、都應多派些人員去學習怎樣才算對敵作戰。</p>
<p>日本從大東亞戰爭後、尤其是近一年　，朝野各方，對於中國確有一番誠意的轉變，可惜中國民間到今天還未違了解。同時，中國的眞正民意、日本當局也未盡了解、這與未能迅速協調不無關係，所以、希　日本當局及東京方面今後來華者，應多多與中國民間接　、傾聽眞正民間意見。</p>
<p>大東亞整個內部問題中、我認為最複雜而難解決者為中國問題，而且中國未來的危機也最大。我在東京訪問，出席東亞同文會座談會時，暢談這一問題，歴時三小時，在座有許多高年皓首的老前輩，談到熱烈時，不知不覺的熱淚淚盈眶，希望中日雙方人士多努力。</p>
<p>目前中國各方面都覺人才缺乏，尤以中日合作的政治經濟文化等事業爲甚，可以說這是過去日本對於中國留學生放任訓練之結果。至於中甘關係能上正常軌道，將在五年十年之後，如果今天日本對於中國留學生生仍探放任主義，則將來人材更感缺乏。最近日本曾公布中國學生嚴格管理辦法，但我在東京時尙未見實在　室圍臬共用豐盛晚餐，似未覺得日本朝野正在吃糙米飯。同時、聽說有富裕之中國留學生，一倜月所化之錢，超過日本高級官咧之月入者、這種現象、當然是中國派遣管理留學生人員之失職，可是，日本敎育當局也須負一部分放任的責任。因此，誠意的睛求山本次官囘國後對於嚴格管理中國留學生一事，特別促成之。現在中國和平區內大學師資頗感缺乏，希絮日本著名學校，如慶應及早稻田等校、能在中國設立分校，培養人才。總之，中國的復興以及中日關係的親善、大半的責任寄託於中國靑年肩上，所以，今天中日兩國當局應有高瞻遠矚，對於培養人才一點，多多致力。</p>
<h3>聞蘭亭氏闡明　棉花統買意義　希望各地棉商共同努力</h3>
<p>棉花統制委員會主任委員　　亭氏、為闡明棉花統買意義、發表談話如次：自國民政府行政院棉花統買統配暫行辦法公布後，棉花統制委員會暨棉花收買同業協會相繼成立、在政府當局及商統會之指導與盟邦各關係當局之援助下、中日紡　業者　密合作、協力　進，關於棉花統買統配實施綱要，亦經擬訂呈報行政院核示，不日即可公布，　就棉花統買之意義方面，略加闡明。</p>
<p>一元化的統配統買</p>
<p>按棉花統買統配暫行辦法第三條之規定「商統會棉花統制委員會應組織棉花收買同業協會，以中日紡織業者爲會員、辦理棉花之收買配給業務，前項同業協會會員會員，得委托各地棉花商收買棉花」、是棉花之收會員辦理，但各地棉花商仍得受協會會員之委托收買棉花，　　去各　廠收花由棉商　負實際收買工作者·毫無差異、所不同者為過去紗廠收花皆各自為政、所收之花，僅自己工廠消費之用、現在統買統買統配、　屬一元的統制收買與一元的統制配給、換言之，乃由政府指令組織　精、導照物資統制法令而實施一元化的收買，在配給方面，則將軍需民需需出以及工廠消費用各項棉花，依戰時需要與安定民生之目的、而實施一元化的配給。今政府旣已　定棉花之收買及配給業務由協會會員　建之、中日紡織　　就其職責及使命上言、決不容有所　　而應羣　羣力以謀完成是項任務。</p>
<p>棉商運用益屬需要</p>
<p>或有對於棉花統買統配暫行辦法第三條之規定而認爲棉花收買業務既由紡織業者辦理、將使棉商無所事事，或究無以圖存，此點殊屬誤解，蓋紗廠業以前收買棉花，各收各用，今所不同者，為統收統配而已紗廠收買棉花以使用為目的，故祇有買進、並無賣出、而棉商以棉花　買為管業、則既有買進，即有賣出。棉商　出乃以紗廠為顧主，今每誤解紗廠收買棉花為　　棉商　業、「殊不以前棉商多經營外棉交易，今則非深入產地，實事收買不可，是棉商之運用益屬需要、現在實施綱要草案內有「凡蘇浙皖三省南京上海兩特別巿各棉花業同業公會會員，向棉統會登記後，卽均得就地收買棉花」之規定，共負實際收花工作者，仍為各地棉商，更因各地棉商收花遇有困難時、棉統會及協會　當盡力為之解除、　如收買棉花資金，將由棉統會設法　貸棉商，以　收買工作之順利推進、並各地添設公庫以　棉商交貨之便利、此外蘇浙皖三省京滬兩特別市地區內所產棉花　年遞减、其週　原因固甚多，要以協農　棉所入，不敎成本為一主因，因此棉統會甚　協會會員及各地棉商依照公定價格，除應得合法利潤外，應使悉數　於棉農之手，是亦問接增產之一助也。總之一。關於棉花增產及收買配給等業務之　　，影響戰時經濟與民生之安定者、至　且鉅，棉統會同人等奉命以來，莫不抱　冰臨　之心，　盼各界人士予以協助，尤望各地棉商本息息相關之旨，共同努力，以完成此　大之使命。</p>

<h3>中北籃球隊　退出西靑賽　華影力戰敗於仁餘</h3>
<p>西靑　球，昨晚展開精彩據戰，不僅甲組戰役，即兩幕乙組，亦至爲緊湊。開鐵戲中隊擊落　隊，戰果爲二十九比二十四，中隊前半以十六比五佔絕大優勢。第二幕乙三組之友聯對華聯乙隊，前半局中，勢均力敵，九比九演成和局於上半時，友聯賴黃逢佳之一罰，以此賽貴之一分，壓倒華聯，十五比十四。甲組第一　華南對同仁，上半時各十六結束0後半時華南　發有爲同仁張邦綸力盡精渡，南急轉直下，四二比二十七大捷。壓軸華影與仁餘，華影上半時打來有聲有色，劉　之遠射、半　一記，有穿楊之妙、前後凡四五次，華影每僅落後一二分，曾追至各十九平手，上半時結果二十五比十九，仁餘佔先，下半時華影力疲，仍有劇戰，結果五卞一比四十五。今晚乙四組一塲，八時E隊對伶友。中北翼隊已正式退出四青，不無减興遺憾。</p>
<p>經濟界</p>
<h3>評言　石渡顧問的意見</h3>
<p>國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郞三十日在京接見記者時，　就中日　　簽訂後國府經濟發展之方向，發表其個人對國府實施經濟統劃政之意見，其最為扼要的幾句話是：『國府之經濟施策，　以增加生產為重點　同時亦應注意消費節約與廢物之收囘，此二點為戰時生產中之重要附帶問題。…他如戰時下之民生安定工作，亦爲要着；國民處於戰時體制下，當屢行飾約，以獲得戰時生活之安定。』石渡顧問並稱國府對此有所提詢、決盡量　戲該項　見、以備參　，其出語之中　與用心之至誠，使得我們十分感佩。</p>
<p>何以節約消費與廢物收囘為戰時生產中之重要附帶問題？因為戰時中物資不足之現象，乃為不可避免的、補救之道，一方面固在於增加生產，可是，另一方面則在於飾約物資。否則，一面是努力生產者，一而是肆情消耗者、以有窮盡之生產興無前盡之消耗放在一起，即言增加生座，也　無號時觀；況且，節約的反面即然奢　、奢產之風所趨，足使一部份的人力，物力、財力，犧牲於不必要之生產，例如一切奢侈品之製造；此外，復有浪費物資者，視廢物如敝　，絲毫不加愛惜，殊不知廢物是可以利用的、尤其是與製造原料有關的廢物，例如廢鐵，廢布，甚至廢紙·都是應當保留的。我們對於節約與戰時經濟之關係，言之屢矣；茲因石渡顧問所言，更申其說、切願全國上下，一致遵行、而政府當局認爲必要時、即予强制執行，亦無不可。</p>

<h3>商統會工作進入　第二階段之各種問題</h3>
<p>自治性格之檢討　近一部份人全張，爲完成物資統制之施策　國　與商統會　　之　　，比利意　日見抬頭。從過去的經騐，商統會營運之最大限力、爲商統會　實業部，糧食部·省市經濟局之間的指導監督權之不甚明確、以及彼此方策權力多有分歧，此外尙有審　會籌關係介入。依我們希望來說，國府決定政策太鋼以外，所有計劃方案應概由商統會担任。將來勢必採取此種政策。若如現狀、要望較好效果、實屬困難。</p>
<p>國家資本之指導民族資本商統會之目的，是在使民族輩　　助國家目　　以上海爲中心的資本，在事變前與政府於互相利用之關係而發展，但其中有拒絕政治力的傾向，此種傾向現在亦爲同樣阻碍中國經濟復興有力的原因。商統會也留意到此點。與中央銀行提携，關於籌備收買資金，用票據方法、動員國家資木，盡最排除惡性資本，以國家資本復興民族資本，亦巳考慮到了。</p>
<p>經濟施策之綜合化商統會之組織及活動易成孤立的，因與一般經濟施策缺乏綜合性的關係，所以今從欲組織之圓滑營運，使其機能之完全發揮，至少與共他之金融，生產方面使之發生　　　　係、　　　一元的統制，這不僅是對內的問題，對外的與華北、華南之移出入貿易亦有同樣之關係。</p>
<p>今後之新方向</p>
<p>以上所述之各種問題、如不能根本斛決，則商統會今後之　運，難望進步，故今後施策，不能推進商統會之權跟。最近國府各機關之更調，對於今後營運亦有期待，由此觀之，今日之商纔會與國府之關係更形密切。所以商統會現在已脫離初期階段，而進入達成眞目的之第二階段了。（　自大陸新報完）。</p>

<h3>決戰下的　華北和蒙疆</h3>
<p>爲了東亞的解放和獨立而掀開戰端以後，已經二年了。新中國由於參戰後的主權之完整和中日同盟條約，在劃時期的兩國共　提携之大目標下、正向共同完遂大東亞戰爭邁進中。記者近由中國派迨煙報道部的幹　，加入華北，　　視察記者團一行，約歷二十日，從南京出發，經徐州·開封·太原·北京·天津的華北各地及大同·　和，張家口等　張各地，視察決戰下的各地情形。以下是把從華中所見華北，蒙疆之實態，使和國府當前所遭遇諸問題關輸而考察起來，報告華中華北打成一片，走上必勝軌道的中國決戰體制之實情：</p>
<p>集中力量增產</p>
<p>完畢了四千公里的旅程、最先感到不問中國方面，日本方面，各地部象中一切力量於增產的一點，向地下資源，地上資源的開發並增產而　進，一刻也不遲滯，立即轉化爲　力以擊滅英美。這在華中自不待說，乃是最重要的課題。無陯從國府所稱完成「後方兵站基地」的任務說來，從對於維持治安·安定民生之相互關係上說來乃是絕對的要求。在農業增產方面，除實施優良　種的配給、農具，肥料之廉價供給，大規校從事實地指導以改善農耕技　外，並有所謂三年建設計劃·白本年十二月起·即將開始東太湖的開拓事業，在米·小麥·棉花的增產上，當有不少的刺激。至於地下資源方面，把准南煤　的煤和馬鞍山附近的鐵礦併合在一起而着手就地製鐵的〇〇製鐵廠、自九月起開始操業，以資减輕運　的負担。</p>
<p>在華北，對這增廑的要求尤有重大的任務。例如煤、製鐵用上所不可缺的强粘結性煤，極爲豐富，其賦存狀態亦易於採掘·又其資材亦比滿洲煤純凈三分之一，每年擬各增產〇〇萬嘲，本年預定出煤〇〇萬　。</p>
<p>到處是煤礦山</p>
<p>河北省的井　，　疆的大同，山四的陽泉，夀陽等沿綫，到處是黑色的煤礦山。在日本，礦夫進入礦穴時，須拿三柏　嘴鋤，所以從日本來的視察旅行者，見到此地礦夫拿一稱頭的鶴嘴斷下礦、無不　得驚異。各地雖也有不利的條件、但由於豐富的勞働力和眞摯的努力，獲良好的成績。</p>
<p>這些物資方面的協力，唯有以有力的政治力爲主體始能貫澈。華北的民衆指導體新民會，和華北政務委員會內外一致，向政治力的滲透，民意的團結，及治案的維持遇進。于月末舉行的國府參戰後初次新民會全體聯合協隊會中·華北　起的熱忱，躍然可見。那時我們適値訪問北京中，出席旁聽，德到關於新團民運動的推進，增產，剿共等完遂政策的具體方　，有熱烈的討論。</p>
<p>新國民的精神</p>
<p>新國民運動自去年七月在南京成立直屬行政院的新運促進委員會以來，　速展開，因本年一月參戰後政治機構的　動，改　國府，在還都三周年之日，組織中國靑少年關並中國靑年模範圍，以此爲中心而推進一大國民運動。　北亦與此相呼應，注意於新民靑少年　的組織强化，改正思想，革新生活，增產，剿共等實踐新運的四大目標，和中央的新運在精神上提携爲一體。</p>
<p>與華中的　鄉工作可對比的華北重要課題，乃剿共工作，新民會首腦部曾表示中國方面的各種施策，以及日軍的討伐，如不能破壞共座然的組織，則不能保持治安，也不能從事平時工作。為從事這剿共工作，於本年四月組織剿共委員會，以謀華北政務委員會，新民會；及治安軍之三位一體化，例如　長瘺該縣新民會總會會長，使行政與新民會造成內外一體，更施行和治安軍密切合作的工作，設定模範區等，此等方法，頗獲相當成功。</p>
<p>因今春的對華新施策，新民會日系職員的大量退出造成暫時的動搖。但不久即踏上根本的軌道、中國方面之自動的創意和日本方面之善意的支援，進向促進強化決戰體制的方向。自八月起至十月末止的三個月間，發起華北新建設運動，發揮政治，軍事，新民會，及民問的　力，欲解決當前的緊急問題。在　對華新施策之澈底的認識上，及食糧問題的解決上，尤其在搜集，配給的强化上，貢獻頗大，小麥的收買成績，亦突破預期的目標。（翔：譯自十一月二十四日四部　日新聞）</p>

<h3>游公園的家長們謹防小孩被騙</h3>
<p>十一月二十日下午三時許，余率三女德珊，五子德武，幼女德祿遊法國公　，兩孩玩球於中央大草坪上　　　坐椅上閱書，幼女僅足二歲，含果於余椅旁約數分鐘後忽失幼女所在。矚目四望，坪上遊人稀少，而幼女方能舉步，決無走失之理。遂命兩孩守於華龍路公園門內，余則向園中四處找尋，約二十分鐘，遍尋無着，遂至園門率兩孩擬返家一詢，蓋恐或有親友有意鬧玩笑，已抱送至家。</p>
<p>俟步至辣斐德路圜門口時，忽覺便念，旋又折囘向園內厕所走去。將近厕所，見迎面來一男一婦，該婦懷抱一孩，三女見之，頻呼妹妹在此。余乃上前細看，果爲幼女，乃問該婦此孩何來，答云：「此孩一人在園中啼哭，無人帶領，這位先生即領共尋家屬不得，擬抱徃　警處招領。」並眴余認識此孩否，余因已被三女叫破，彼等見貌辯色，早知爲吾女即交付余抱，反責何不當心乃爾，於是彼二人從容分道而去。各自東四，若不相識者。</p>
<p>余急於呼醒幼女，而仍熟睡如故，乃用種種方法捏其鼻，捫其口，因氣悶而稍動，但猶未淸醒，直呼至三十餘分鐘之久，始睜開眼睛，而神智仍不淸，再三四分鐘，治放哭聲。余即詢幼女彼不認識者抱汝，曾如何對汝？幼女云，曾給食糖一顆遂知糖內定有安眠藥憩，始悔未將該二人拘警，或可發現共他拐驪案情也。望各家長遊　者戒之慎之，又希望團警見有小孩啼哭及懷抱熱睡者，嚴密盤問，期有破案之可能。（盧效汾）</p>
<h3>景鴻小學學生　援助災童</h3>
<p>那是一個西北風緊括的星期六下午，我們全校的小朋友，在老師們帶領下，整着隊到勞利育路去訪問上海災童敎養院。唉！不去訪問，倒也罷了，一去訪問，實在使我們太傷感了！因爲他們在這樣冷的天氣，還只穿上破碎的夾衣，有的還赤着脚，晚上蓋的只一條薄薄的而且棉絮巳擠在一起的被頭呀！至於他們每天吃的，聽說：老是些山芋珍珠米粉等雜糧，有時接濟斷了，還得挨餓一餐半頓。雖然，他們現在在院裏，有着七八位熱情的老師像怒母般撫養着，敎育着，好像一個大家庭似的過着生活。不過要是一般社會人士，不源源的接濟他們，邪未一切都完了。</p>
<p>我們是一羣力量簿弱而有着熱忱援助他們的小朋友，因此我們回到校裏以後立刻發動了一個「援助災童述動」發願將爸媽給我們的糖果錢，省下來，聚起來，經一個多星期的努力，積下中儲券五百十三元二角整，和小朋友徵得家長同意，而捐出的舊衣裳七件，舊鞋子四十七雙，鉛筆十三打，還有遺失箱裏堆積好久而沒人認領的橡皮筆墨等零星物件五百餘件，一併送到那教養院裏去了。當然這是一個小小的援助，不夠滿意。但是我們想：我們全市各小學校的小朋友，如一果都能來這一個「援助災童運動」，那末，全市各災童敎養院，一定都能得到偉大的援助呀。私立景鴻小學全體學生上。</p>

        <h1>1943.12.02</h1>
<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>The transportation industry itself has no purpose, its purpose is to reduce the difficulties of people and goods moving from one location to another, as well as to save time in the movement of people and goods, in order to increase the efficiency of human resources and ensure the smooth flow of materials. This is true in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Therefore, the transportation industry is a tool for various industries and a basic factor for various industries in any period.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the conditions that the transportation industry should have, generally speaking for passenger and freight transportation, are as follows: Accurate departure and arrival times. Use all rational methods to reduce costs. Try to increase speed to reduce overall travel time. Determine the number of trips and the capacity of each trip according to actual needs. Equipment should be as comprehensive as possible to ensure that safety and comfort requirements reach the lowest standards. This is true for long-distance transportation, and also for short-distance transportation. Therefore, the achievements of the transportation industry are sufficient to observe the rise and fall of a country in peacetime, and to measure the success or failure of the future in wartime. This has been true throughout history, both in China and abroad.</p>
<p>Regarding the current railway system, the accuracy of time can be barely satisfactory, and the fairness of pricing is also acceptable. However, the existence of black market train tickets, the difficulty of buying tickets, the difficulty of boarding, the messy and complicated searches, and the crowded carriages are all annoying and puzzling. There are unscrupulous people who create this chaotic situation and carry out their plans to profit from troubled waters, but the main body of the railway has no decisive measures to clarify the situation in order to complete its mission.</p>
<p>Regarding urban public transportation, its chaotic state is truly astonishing. The arrogance of drivers and ticket sellers, stopping without following station stops, the inconsistent fares, and the uneven frequency of vehicles all fully demonstrate that public transportation has no intention of serving the public, but wants to make it difficult for the public. The relevant competent authorities cannot shirk their responsibility, and those responsible for supervision also turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>Regarding general street traffic, it seems that there should be no problems, but there is a possibility of interruption in the morning and evening, and there is a concern of obstruction in the east and west. Asking the reason, it is either foreign guests passing through or important people visiting. This seems to make sense, but thinking about it, it is enough to feel ashamed. Because security has not been established, there is concern about sudden attacks, but if public opinion is trusted, why commit offenses? If it is said that it is only related to face-saving and a bit of decoration, then the area of alert should be reduced as much as possible, and the time of alert should be reduced as much as possible. Humbly, without lofty arguments, at least it can make the small people who are busy for food and clothing not feel stuck from time to time!</p>
<p>In addition, setting up checkpoints for inspection in various important areas is necessary in extraordinary times. However, there should also be strict rules and clear prohibitions so that people can follow them, and the interception and punishment are also based on evidence. Otherwise, the people will waste time and money, and the government will lose its credibility. This not only hinders transportation but also taints the administration of officials.</p>
<p>From spiritual decline to transportation corruption, and then to the decline of all industries. How can we talk about increasing production and enriching national power, let alone taking on the mission of an allied country in East Asia? I hope that people in the government and the public will think about it repeatedly!</p>
<h3>Fourth Naval Air Battle East of the Gilbert Islands: Japanese Headquarters Announces Sinking of Four Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 1st: On the evening of November 29, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force attacked the enemy mobile fleet in the sea east of the Gilbert Islands, and the results were as follows: Two aircraft carriers sunk (one bombed and sunk), one ship of unknown type sunk, and one large cruiser destroyed (heavily damaged and on fire). Our aircraft returned. (Note) This air battle is called the Fourth Naval Air Battle of the Gilbert Islands.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The battle situation in the Gilbert Islands is becoming more intense. Japanese naval units have sunk and destroyed two enemy large cruisers and one transport ship. Furthermore, they have expanded their results, sinking and destroying several enemy ships (including one enemy aircraft carrier sunk). The Japanese General Headquarters is scheduled to announce details of the battle results in the afternoon of the 1st.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - From November 19 to the Fourth Naval Air Battle of the Gilbert Islands, the combined results of the Japanese Navy Air Force and submarines (including the air defense results of the ground forces) are as follows: Immediately sunk four enemy aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and one destroyer, for a total of six ships. Sunk three enemy aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and one ship of unknown type, for a total of six ships. Destroyed four enemy aircraft carriers, one battleship or cruiser, one cruiser or battleship, one large cruiser (heavily damaged and on fire), one cruiser, and two transport ships, for a total of ten ships. Shot down 125 enemy aircraft. The Japanese side lost 27 aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 1st that the Japanese Navy Air Force sank two enemy aircraft carriers and one ship of unknown type, and destroyed one large cruiser in the sea off the Gilbert Islands on the 29th. This was only eleven days after the American aircraft carrier group appeared in the waters of the Gilbert Islands on the morning of November 19. The Japanese Navy Air Force sank or heavily damaged eleven enemy aircraft carriers and caused the loss of eleven other ships, achieving astonishing results. What is particularly noteworthy is that aircraft carriers accounted for half of the total of 22 enemy ships sunk or destroyed. In these continuous naval and air battles, the enemy's loss of so many aircraft carriers is unprecedented in any war history. Observing the above figures, it is clear that the enemy's counterattack on the Gilbert Islands was centered on an aircraft carrier group, and it was a second counterattack centered on newly built aircraft carriers, so its significance is extremely great. Furthermore, since August of last year until the end of last year, in the successive naval battles in the Solomon Sea, the enemy had adopted the aircraft carrier-centered doctrine, but at that time it was parallel and coordinated operations between aircraft carriers and fleets, which was completely different in nature from this aircraft carrier-centered operation. Secondly, since the beginning of the year until the enemy's landing on Renteba Island on June 30, and the landing on Morin Island on October 27, the enemy had adopted the base air force-centered doctrine, but after landing on Renoeyden, the aircraft carrier operations and base air force operations were merged. In this new counterattack operation in the Gilbert Islands, the enemy sent a large aircraft carrier group to attack, completely adopting the aircraft carrier-centered tactic. The enemy daring to send such a large-scale aircraft carrier group to attack in the waters where the Japanese army controlled air supremacy only showed their blind action and misjudgment. However, from another perspective, the enemy's counterattack attempt is truly unprecedented in its activity. At the same time, it illustrates the important position of air power in modern warfare. Observing the enemy's efforts to build aircraft carriers, they may still have dozens of standard aircraft carriers and auxiliary carriers. Therefore, the enemy's combat power still has ample surplus and should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>US Navy Secretary Knox Tries to Cover Up Damage</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Washington: When US Navy Secretary Knox met with the old guard group on the 30th, he once again mentioned that the US military suffered great damage in the landing operation in the Gilbert Islands. In order to cover up the situation, his answers were ambiguous. He said: The landing operation in the Gilbert Islands was an unusually difficult battle. Also, fearing that publishing the specific figures of the damage would cause a major blow to the American people, he used the phrase "no specific report has been received" to cover it up. When the reporter group asked why the American military fought so hard, he argued: The American military did not accurately assess the Japanese military's combat power on the Gilbert Islands, especially Tarawa Island. Therefore, before the landing, they thoroughly bombarded the Japanese military positions with aircraft, and when the landing began, they also carried out a fierce attack with naval guns. However, when the landing troops began to land, the sea conditions suddenly changed, causing many boats to run aground. As a result, they were heavily fired upon by the Japanese army, and the damage suffered was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Continuously Bombard Wewak and But</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain unit of the Japanese army in the South Pacific, at approximately 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, approximately 50 enemy B-24 bombers and fighters attacked Wewak. Japanese ground artillery fire shot down two of them. The Japanese side suffered extremely minor losses. On the morning of the 28th, approximately 25 enemy B-24 bombers and several P-38 fighter planes attacked But (between Wewak and Madang). Japanese ground artillery fire shot down four enemy aircraft. The Japanese side suffered no damage. Also, on the morning of the 28th, approximately 40 enemy B-24 bombers and 30 fighter planes attacked Wewak. Ground artillery fire destroyed two enemy B-24 bombers. The remaining aircraft were driven back. The damage on the Japanese side was extremely minor.</p>
<p>A certain base in the South Pacific, 1st (Central News Agency) - The center of the South Pacific war situation seems to be shifting to the Gilbert Islands area, but in the New Georgia area, the enemy's landing forces are still fighting fiercely. At 9:00 p.m. on November 29, enemy troops, under the protection of cruisers and destroyers, attempted to land in the Torokina Point area with 56 large landing craft. Japanese ground forces immediately launched a fierce attack. On the same night, another unit of the Japanese army ambushed the enemy landing forces from the rear, completely annihilating the landing force.</p>
<h3>Nimitz Admits Operational Difficulties</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Pearl Harbor, US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, after inspecting the front lines in the Gilbert Islands area, returned to this place on the 30th. He acknowledged the difficulties of the US military's operations in that area. It is said that the US military has suffered fierce attacks from the Japanese army in the Gilbert Islands, especially the attack on Tarawa Island, which was the most difficult battle the US military has experienced in the Pacific theater.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Unit Receives Letter of Appreciation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ministry of the Navy announced at 11:00 a.m. on the 1st: A certain Japanese naval unit, which defeated a superior enemy fleet with a small force in the naval battle off Longa last month, was recently awarded a letter of appreciation by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet.</p>
<h3>US Marine Corps Commander Replaced</h3>
<p>Elmira, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a German news agency dispatch from Washington: Lieutenant General Vandergrift has been replaced by Lieutenant General Holcomb as Commander of the US Marine Corps.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities in the Philippines Return Property to Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Manila, 1st (Central News Agency) - The authorities of the Japanese dispatched army in the Philippines are acting as custodians of enemy property. A portion of the property owned by overseas Chinese was returned on October 1st. The second batch of returns was carried out on the 1st by the military authorities, transferring a total of fifteen items, including the Zhisha Factory, etc., owned by Li Shucai, a standing member of the Philippine Aid Anti-Enemy Committee, and Zeng Hanquan, the executive member and propaganda section chief of the Chongqing Kuomintang Philippines General Branch, to the relevant overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>British Military Inspection Team Member Dies in Plane Crash</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Sydney, a British military inspection team is currently conducting inspections at the Southwest Pacific battle front. A certain Lieutenant General, a member of the team, died in a plane crash in New Caledonia.</p>
<h3>Aokiji Den'o, President of the Hospital, Congratulates the Third Anniversary of the Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - October 30th is the third anniversary of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. Aokiji Den'o, President of the Daito Medical College in Japan, sent a congratulatory message to the President of the Executive Yuan, which read: "On the occasion of the third anniversary of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, I congratulate you on the increasingly solid triple alliance, and the determination to build a new order in Greater East Asia is also strengthened. I also wish you good health."</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Actually Openly Advocates Using Poison Gas Warfare Against Japan</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 1st (Central News Agency) - After the American military suffered repeated defeats in the Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands, they increasingly felt the difficulty of fighting against Japan. Therefore, they were anxiously seeking effective war preparations to fight against Japan. The New York Daily News openly advocated adopting poison gas tactics to attack Japan in its editorial on November 3. The main points are as follows: "We must use a blitzkrieg against Japan. Japan has at least 70 million people, which is more than double the 35 million in the United States. The approximately 20 million people in Asia and the Pacific islands are also cooperating with Japan, and their strength should not be underestimated. If we must capture the small islands in the Pacific one by one, we will have to suffer repeated large-scale losses like the Tarawa battle. The only way for us is to use excellent weapons to launch a fatal attack on the heart of Japan. If poison gas can cause fatal damage to Japan, then we should use poison gas against Japan."</p>

<h3>Minister of the Navy Issues Statement on the South Pacific Campaign: Praises the Allied Naval and Air Forces for Their Outstanding Achievements</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Recently, the Japanese Air Force has repeatedly achieved brilliant results in Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands. In the fourth naval air battle in the Gilbert Islands, the Japanese army once again achieved outstanding results. For this reason, the reporter visited Minister of the Navy Ren Yuandao to inquire about his opinion, and he agreed to issue the following statement:</p>
<p>At the time when the Greater East Asia Conference is being completed, the Allied navy has won unprecedented victories in the Solomon front line of Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands. The greatness of its war results is even more spectacular than the surprise attack on Hawaii. This shows the true strength of the Allied navy, which is truly beyond the dreams of Britain and the United States. It will not be easy for the US Navy to reorganize its forces and try to revitalize itself in the future. After suffering heavy losses in Hawaii, the combined navy used a few days to sink the fleet that the US Navy had prepared and assembled for a year and a half into the depths of the ocean. In the future, if it wants to re-emerge, the time required can also be predicted, and the difficulty of replenishment is self-evident.</p>
<p>The bravery and combativeness of the Japanese navy has shocked the world and made the enemy cold since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Since the five air battles off Bougainville Island, the strength of the American navy has been greatly hit. Especially battleships and aircraft carriers, the American side has sunk and destroyed as many as fourteen ships. Including other ships, a total of eighty ships. The huge war results achieved by the Japanese navy are rare in the history of the world navy. US President Roosevelt and his military authorities are also afraid that this kind of miserable defeat will be known to their people. In addition to trying to cover it up, they are also trying to shift their national goals. The US military attempted to act recklessly in the Gilbert Islands on November 21, but so far, the US military has been defeated four times in a row. The result is no less tragic than on Bougainville Island.</p>
<p>In the previous three Gilbert Islands naval air battles, enemy American aircraft carriers, destroyers, and cruisers were sunk and destroyed, and there were also fourteen ships. As many as one hundred and twenty-five enemy aircraft were shot down. The heaviness of the loss and the number of sacrifices are beyond imagination. As the news came, the Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of the fourth Gilbert Islands naval air battle on the 1st, and sunk two more enemy aircraft carriers. From this, it can be known that the enemy's strength has been greatly hit, especially aircraft carriers, whose position is extremely important in today's naval and air battles, and construction and modification are not easy. It will not be possible for the US military to replenish them in the short term. Even if they try to act recklessly again, looking for an opportunity to launch a conspiracy, they will be severely attacked by the Japanese navy again. While admiring the loyalty and bravery of the Japanese navy, I also hope that even greater war results will continue to be reported.</p>

<h3>Large U.S. Air Formations Day Attack the Ruhr Area, Bremen Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – German News Agency: Large formations of enemy bombers flew over western Germany in the early morning of the 30th. One squadron feigned an attack on southwestern Germany, while another, under fighter escort, flew over the Netherlands. After the fighter escort withdrew, this squadron changed course and rushed into the Ruhr area. German fighters immediately intercepted them, preventing a concentrated attack and driving them westward. The U.S. planes then dropped bombs on the southern Ruhr area, but failed to aim accurately, causing only minor damage and slight casualties among the population. It is currently known that several enemy bombers were shot down, and three more crashed in Dutch territory.</p>

<h3>Fierce Offensive and Defensive Battles on the Gomel Front, Soviets Admit Retreat from Korosten</h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – German News Agency: The German army has been engaged in major defensive battles west and north of Gomel for some time. The Soviet army's attacks at 星之地點 since the summer have failed, so at least in that area, a decisive victory has been achieved. Therefore, reinforcements of infantry and tanks continue to join the battle. The Soviet army, using superior manpower and materials, pushed back the German lines by several kilometers at some strongholds, but their attempts to break through were thwarted by fierce German resistance and deep, echeloned defenses. The Soviet army's eleven attempts to attack in the 尼繼爾 River bend were repulsed. At the same time, German forces continue to advance on the southern side of the 河套 to overcome Soviet resistance. The German defensive lines have been greatly improved. On the Crimean front, after the Soviet army suffered setbacks in the Isthmus of Perekop, there has been no news of major activity, but the Red Army continues to attack the Nikopol bridgehead and the 伯 River bend. However, the intensity of the Soviet attacks is not as great as in previous days. Fierce fighting continues in Cherkasy, but the situation west of Kyiv and in Korosten is relatively calm. Local operations by German forces there have resulted in great victories, allowing them to expand their lines.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Central News Agency, 2nd – On Tuesday evening, Moscow officially announced that Soviet troops had withdrawn from the city of Korosten on the evening of November 30th due to increased German pressure, and were forced to retreat to more advantageous positions east of the city.</p>

Their vanguard appears to have advanced to Castelnuovo, one mile north of Venafro. In the eastern war zone, fierce attacks continue. It is reported that the British Eighth Army has crossed the mouth of the Sangro River and established a bridgehead on the north bank of the river, now engaged in fierce fighting with counterattacking forces. The center of the struggle is Lanciano. According to German reports, a local salient has been created as a result of the British, Canadian, and New Zealand forces' frontal assault, but due to intense German counterattacks, the British forces suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – German News Agency: Fighting continues in the Adriatic coastal region of southern Italy, while local fierce battles occurred in the Apennine mountain area of central Italy on Sunday. General Clark is still engaged in reinforcing troops in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, while General Montgomery, after weeks of preparation, has amassed a large number of troops and supplies, launching the large-scale offensive that had been widely expected. The intensified activity of the British Eighth Army can be seen as a full-scale attempt to disrupt the German defense zone in the mountains, in order to accelerate their pace of advance.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Social Welfare Work: Minister Ding's Talk to Reporters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Ministry of Social Welfare has recently been quite active in promoting social welfare work. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed the Minister yesterday, asking about the key points of the Ministry's future work, the distinction between proactive and reactive social welfare, and the doubts regarding the unified fundraising of welfare funds. Minister T answered each question as follows:</p>
<p>Statements Made</p>
<p>(Q) What are the key points of the Ministry of Social Welfare's current promotion of social welfare? (A) Social welfare is the implementation of social policy. In this wartime, to adapt to the actual needs, we should focus on wartime social policy, in other words, focus on proactive social welfare. (Q) What is the true content of proactive and reactive social welfare? (A) Reactive social welfare is mostly focused on poverty relief, assistance to orphans, the elderly, and disaster relief. In contrast, proactive social welfare takes promoting social construction and increasing national strength as its premise. For example, labor protection and labor welfare, farmer protection and rural welfare, spiritual and ideological guidance for farmers and workers, vocational guidance and job placement, promotion and guidance of national physical strength, promotion and guidance of national health, eugenics guidance and promotion of cultivation, guidance on social insurance and simple compulsory insurance, the promotion of labor, the promotion of social thrift, the protection of mothers and children, the construction of rural charity granaries, the improvement of social life, the guidance of civilian consultations, and the assistance of the economic status of the poor all belong to proactive social welfare. In addition, the education of vagrants and orphans, the protection of the disabled, elderly, and weak, the assistance of sick travelers, the promotion of social services, the relief of wartime civilians, and the relief of floods, droughts, and all disasters all belong to reactive social welfare. (Q) Social welfare concrete undertakings, the scope is so broad, one by one implementation, since the need for a lot of funding, I do not know what preparations your ministry has for this? (A) In this wartime, the state treasury has many expenses, such as welfare funds, all borne by the state treasury, it is difficult, if the civil cooperation, will be easier to promote. Regarding this point, this ministry has formulated the outline of unified fundraising of social welfare funds in various provinces, cities, and counties, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. This ministry has set up a central social welfare fund fundraising committee, and various provinces and cities have set up local social welfare fund fundraising committees, as specialized management agencies for unified fundraising. After this, according to the implementation, it is easier to raise funds. In addition, this ministry has requested the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to the provincial and municipal governments, and the Ministry of Finance to issue a general order to the provincial and municipal finance departments, to increase the welfare project funds in the local expenditure budget for the next year. If the local gentry raise money from the people on the spot, and the local government generously allocates funds from the local public funds, then the welfare funds will not suffer from no funding in the future. (Q) Reports indicate that the Ministry of Social Welfare has announced the rules for fundraising for privately run welfare projects, which impose many restrictions on fundraising for privately run welfare projects. What is the purpose? (A) In the past, privately run welfare projects freely raised funds, although Zhu Neng could certainly have abuses, but the donors were overwhelmed, which is a fact, so we specially formulated these rules, so that recognition and fundraising have their own compliance. In the future, any privately run welfare project, fundraising funds, still need to apply to the competent social welfare fund fundraising committee for approval in advance, all donation books and coupons, also need to be sent for stamping. Those who have not been approved and do not follow the regulations and procedures will be banned. However, the competent authorities, when privately run welfare projects apply for fundraising funds, after careful review, such as the proposed projects, there is a need, or the projects that have been done, there are still unfinished, of course, to give approval, and assist in their fundraising, compared to free fundraising, the effectiveness will be even more magnificent. (Q) Now in winter, how does the department guide the winter relief work in various places? (A) Winter relief and winter prevention are closely related. If winter relief is handled well, then winter prevention will also be satisfactory. Only winter relief is once a year, which is regular. In terms of region, no matter where, there is a need, so it is very common. Regular and universal relief should be organized by the localities themselves, which is easier and more thorough. It is also found that in the past, the fundraising funds for winter relief, etc., were extremely divergent, and this year, the localities have generally tended to be unified. In the past, officials and civilians each acted on their own in organizing relief, but this year, we strive for cooperation to avoid duplication. This step is very gratifying. (Q) The Ministry of Welfare recently announced the Outline of National Obligation Labor, I do not know how Shanghai will implement it? (A) National obligation labor is also a proactive one, which has been implemented in countries such as Japan and Germany for a long time, and has been quite effective. In the past, during the military period in our country, there were often cases of requisitioning obligation labor, so in our country, it is not a new creation. The purpose of this widespread promotion is to adapt to the wartime system, force labor, increase national strength, and cultivate the general public's work habits, strengthen their physique, sense of service, and spirit of hard work. In the early stage of promotion, we first select areas to do experiments. Worry State designated Nanjing as the experimental area, and each province designated the provincial capital as the experimental area. The experimental area of Shanghai is in contact with the municipal government, and then decide to implement it. Probably the South City or Pu Dong are more suitable.</p>

<h3>Five Major Groups Hold Tea Party to Welcome Vice Minister Yamamoto, Over 200 Chinese and Japanese Guests Attend, Situation Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry of the allied nation Japan, came to China specifically to attend the meeting of ambassadors and consuls stationed in China. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Welfare Association, the Press Association, and the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee, five major groups, taking advantage of Mr. Yamamoto's visit to Shanghai, specially held a grand tea party at the Xingya Building Federation of Industry and Commerce meeting hall at 4 p.m. yesterday (1st) to express their welcome. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Vice Minister Yamamoto Speaking at the Joint Reception of Five Groups</p>
<p>Guests Attending</p>
<p>In addition to the guest of honor Vice Minister Yamamoto arriving on time, our officials who attended included Secretary-General Zhao, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department, and Director Ye of the Public Utilities Bureau. On the Allied side were Major General Koyabedai, Secretary Iwai, Secretary Nakata, Vice Consul Fukuma, and approximately 200 members of the five groups. The hosts included Yuan Deng and Wu Hengru from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Zhang Yizhan from the Welfare Association, Koshiro Takeo, Funatsu Tatsichiro, Kurimoto Sanji, Takeuchi Fumihiko, Chen Shaoqi, 廠南, Wang Shuxian, and Xu Xiaochu from the Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhao Zhengping and Zhao Jinqing from the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee, and Yuan Xueyi, Xu Liqiu, and Chen Binshu from the Press Association.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Yuan Deng delivered a welcome speech: "Mr. Yamamoto, and all the gentlemen present, today I represent the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee, the Press Association, and the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce in welcoming Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry of our friendly nation Japan. I feel sincerely gratified. Mr. Yamamoto is a senior alumnus of the Tongwen College, and has held important positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, such as Director of the Bureau of Trade and the Bureau of Asia. This time, with the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, he is the first Vice Minister. From Mr. Yamamoto's long experience, we can fully understand that Mr. Yamamoto has a very close relationship with China. Today, the hundreds of millions of people of Greater East Asia are single-mindedly building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Naturally, we have deep expectations for Mr. Yamamoto. Today, we are honored that Mr. Yamamoto has not rejected our invitation to attend this welcome party. We sincerely hope that Mr. Yamamoto will give us more guidance." Koshiro Takeo reported on the purpose of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, a joint organization of Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce, which is to unite under the common goal of close cooperation between China and Japan, and to strive for co-existence and co-prosperity in each of our respective positions. Then Mr. Yamamoto delivered a speech and gave thanks. Afterwards, Zhang Yizhan and Zhao Zhengping delivered speeches (unfortunately, the Central News Agency did not record them, so they are missing, which is very regrettable). Secretary-General Zhao and Bin Xiang delivered speeches in succession. 衣全 took photos. The party ended joyfully after 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Yamamoto's Speech</p>
<p>"I am very grateful for the warm reception today. As Chairman Yuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce said, I graduated from Tongwen College in Shanghai when I was young, and then returned to my country to serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years. I have been assigned to various places in China and Manchuria to serve. In the past, I always cared about the ties between China and Japan, hoping to achieve close cooperation. Although I am old now, my belief has always been consistent. Now that the relationship between China and Japan has returned to normal, I am quite optimistic, and I feel that the emphasis on the relationship between the two countries prompted me to come to China for an inspection. Because of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty concluded between Japan and China this time, and the joint declaration issued by various groups in Greater East Asia, the Japanese government and the people have practiced and vigorously implemented them, clearly indicating that they hope that the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia will also cooperate in the same way. When I was in my country, I had already seen that the situation among the people had suddenly become happy. In short, the Japanese government is determined to implement co-existence and co-prosperity with China and all countries in East Asia. This is the established policy of the Japanese government. During this trip to China, I have met with people from all walks of life to listen to their opinions. I hope that all sectors of China will have the same determination and sincerity as Japan, and cooperate with each other. Then the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed, creating a new world."</p>
<p>Zhao Zunyue's Speech</p>
<p>"Today, I am fortunate to have heard many great speeches at the welcome for Vice Minister Yamamoto, which is deeply fortunate. The relationship between China and Japan is very deep in geography, history, culture, and politics, so building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is naturally without problem, and it must succeed. However, both China and Japan have long felt this specific theory. On the Chinese side, there is my late Premier's Greater Asia Doctrine, and on the Japanese side, there is the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, when we re-examine the politics, culture, geography, and history of China and Japan, how did these invisible errors occur in the past? There are many reasons. To give a simple example, both China and Japan have been provoked and invaded by Europeans in the East. Secondly, we have held on to egoism, neglecting the greater self, which has caused the mistakes of the two countries in the past. We need to study the Greater East Asia policy and achieve the bright conditions of the two countries. First, eliminate the European divisive policy. Second, advocate the doctrine of the greater self and overcome egoism. In the two countries, the enlightened authorities firmly believe in promoting the Greater East Asia policy. The current trend in Greater East Asia is to drive the United Kingdom and the United States out of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Now we have taken a further step. China and Japan jointly excavate and advocate the doctrine of the greater self, which is jointly established. Although this action is invisible, its importance is still urgently needed. As for how to promote it, the director of the previous small space said that each strives in its water position, regardless of each other, which is one of them. Briefly stated, it is that in the event of a crisis, we should not be afraid of danger, and resolutely rescue it, which is what we should do, but that point is a temporary emergency, and in peacetime, we should stand in our position and do our best, and respect each other. This is often a smooth promotion. Vice Minister Yamamoto is the leader of the Greater East Asia policy. This time, he has come to China to inspect, despite his hard work. I have no contribution, only to express what I think, as a report. I hope that the two countries will work together to complete the health of Mr. Yamamoto and the completion of the Greater East Asia policy."</p>

How will it be produced? This is a major issue for the participation of citizens in government. Please give a detailed answer."</p>

Now that the two concessions have been recovered, this issue is currently being actively researched by the Municipal Government to find a practical solution."</p>
<p>Coffee Night Seat</p>
<p>Zhong She asked: "Recently, many cafes and free cafeterias in Shanghai have dance floors, calling themselves 'Coffee Night Seats'! Every night after the dance floor closes at twelve o'clock, they continue to sing and dance behind closed doors until dawn, which seems to be inconsistent with the law. I don't know if the authorities have heard about it, and whether they will be banned?"</p>
<p>The Second Police Bureau replied: "After receiving the order, the police bureau has issued written or oral warnings to many cafes and nightclubs that violate this law. In the future, the police bureau will pay more attention and send personnel to strictly investigate and ban them."</p>
<p>Situation at the Station</p>
<p>Dalu Xinbao asked: "The situation at the railway station in Shanghai has long been criticized by travelers. I think the authorities have also been aware of it for a long time. I don't know what methods there are to improve it?"</p>
<p>The First Police Bureau replied: "Regarding the lack of information for passengers at the North Railway Station, we will soon hold a joint meeting with relevant parties to discuss improvement methods."</p>
<p>Coal Ball Panic</p>
<p>Dalu Xinbao asked: "Coal balls are daily necessities, but recently they are not easy to purchase. I don't know if the authorities can find a way to remedy this kind of pain for the citizens?"</p>
<p>The Economic Bureau replied: "The reason for the coal ball panic in Shanghai is the lack of sources, inconvenient transportation, and reduced production in coal-producing areas. It is now planned to implement quota allocation, which is expected to be implemented in the near future. However, the coal ball allocation is 20,000 tons per month, and the number of shortages is also in contact with the Ministry of Industry to transport non-controlled coal to seek remedy."</p>

<h3>Welcoming Vice Minister Yamamoto — Speech at the Joint Tea Party —</h3>
<p>— Chen Binshu</p>
<p>Today, five non-governmental organizations in Shanghai are jointly welcoming Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry. I would like to briefly share a few points:</p>
<p>When I went to Japan for sightseeing last month and stepped into Japanese territory, the first thing I felt was that both the government and the public were united and seriously fighting the enemy for the liberation of Greater East Asia. We are also participating in the war today. Whether it is the government or the public, we should send more people to learn what it means to fight the enemy.</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, especially in the past year, the government and the public in Japan have sincerely changed their attitudes towards China. Unfortunately, the Chinese people have not understood this to this day. At the same time, the Japanese authorities have not fully understood the true public opinion of China, which is not unrelated to the failure to quickly coordinate. Therefore, I hope that the Japanese authorities and Tokyo will send more people to China in the future to contact the Chinese people and listen to the true public opinion.</p>
<p>Among the entire internal problems of Greater East Asia, I believe that the most complicated and difficult to solve is the China problem, and the future crisis of China is also the greatest. When I visited Tokyo and attended the East Asia Tongwen Society symposium, I talked about this issue for three hours. There were many senior elders in attendance. When we talked about the heat, tears unknowingly filled our eyes. I hope that people from both China and Japan will work hard.</p>
<p>At present, all aspects of China feel a lack of talent, especially in the political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings of Sino-Japanese cooperation. It can be said that this is the result of the past Japanese laissez-faire training of Chinese students. As for Sino-Japanese relations being able to get on the right track, it will be in five or ten years. If Japan still adopts a laissez-faire attitude towards Chinese students today, there will be an even greater lack of talent in the future. Recently, Japan announced strict management measures for Chinese students, but when I was in Tokyo, I did not see the actual meal. The room was filled with abundant dinners, and it did not seem that the Japanese government and the public were eating coarse rice. At the same time, I heard that some wealthy Chinese students spend more money in one month than the monthly income of high-ranking Japanese officials. This phenomenon is certainly the dereliction of duty of the Chinese personnel sent to manage the students. However, the Japanese education authorities must also bear part of the responsibility for laissez-faire. Therefore, I sincerely request Vice Minister Yamamoto to urge the strict management of Chinese students after returning to his country. At present, there is a shortage of university teachers in the peaceful areas of China. I hope that famous Japanese schools, such as Keio and Waseda, can establish branches in China to cultivate talent. In short, the revival of China and the friendship between China and Japan, most of the responsibility rests on the shoulders of Chinese youth. Therefore, the authorities of China and Japan today should have a broad vision and devote more effort to cultivating talent.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lan Ting Clarifies the Significance of Unified Cotton Purchase, Hoping Cotton Merchants in All Regions Will Work Together</h3>
<p>Mr. Lan Ting, Chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, made the following statement to clarify the significance of unified cotton purchase: Since the promulgation of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton by the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Cotton Control Committee and the Cotton Purchasing Association have been established successively. Under the guidance of the government authorities and the assistance of relevant Allied authorities, Chinese and Japanese spinners have cooperated closely and worked together to make progress. The outline for the implementation of unified cotton purchase and distribution has also been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and instructions, and will be promulgated soon. A brief clarification is provided regarding the significance of unified cotton purchase.</p>
<p>Unified Purchase and Distribution</p>
<p>According to Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton, "The Cotton Control Committee of the Business Coordination Committee shall organize a Cotton Purchasing Association, with Chinese and Japanese textile operators as members, to handle cotton purchase and allocation. Members of the aforementioned association may entrust cotton merchants in various regions to purchase cotton." Therefore, the cotton is purchased and managed by association members, but cotton merchants in various regions can still be entrusted by association members to purchase cotton. This is no different from the past when cotton merchants were responsible for the actual purchase work for various factories. The difference lies in the fact that in the past, yarn factories purchased cotton independently, and the cotton purchased was only used for their own factory's consumption. Now, unified purchase and distribution belong to unified control purchase and unified control distribution. In other words, it is the government issuing instructions to organize elites to implement unified purchase in accordance with material control laws. In terms of distribution, various types of cotton for military and civilian needs, as well as factory consumption, will be allocated in a unified manner in accordance with wartime needs and the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Now that the government has decided that the purchase and distribution of cotton will be handled by association members, Chinese and Japanese textile operators should not tolerate any slackness in their duties and missions, and should work together to complete this task.</p>
<p>The Use of Cotton Merchants is Even More Necessary</p>
<p>Some may believe that the provision in Article 3 of the Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton, which states that cotton purchase is handled by textile operators, will leave cotton merchants with nothing to do or no way to survive. This is a misunderstanding. In the past, yarn factories purchased cotton for their own use. The only difference now is that it is unified purchase and distribution. Yarn factories purchase cotton for the purpose of using it, so they only buy in and do not sell out. Cotton merchants, on the other hand, manage cotton sales, so they both buy in and sell out. Cotton merchants sell to yarn factories as their customers. It is a misunderstanding that yarn factories purchasing cotton will undermine the cotton merchants' business. In the past, cotton merchants mostly engaged in foreign cotton transactions, but now they must go deep into the producing areas and conduct actual purchases. Therefore, the use of cotton merchants is even more necessary. The draft implementation outline currently includes the provision that "all members of cotton trade associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, may purchase cotton locally after registering with the Cotton Control Committee." The actual work of purchasing cotton is still carried out by cotton merchants in various regions. Furthermore, when cotton merchants in various regions encounter difficulties in purchasing cotton, the Cotton Control Committee and the association will do their best to resolve them. For example, the Cotton Control Committee will find ways to provide loans to cotton merchants to facilitate the smooth progress of the purchase work, and additional public warehouses will be set up in various regions to facilitate cotton merchants' delivery. In addition, the cotton production in the areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, has been decreasing year by year. There are many reasons for this, but a major cause is that farmers are not taught the cost of cotton farming when they cooperate in cotton production. Therefore, the Cotton Control Committee and association members, as well as cotton merchants in various regions, should ensure that all profits beyond legal profits are fully returned to the cotton farmers according to the official prices, which will also indirectly help increase production. In short, matters related to cotton production, purchase, and distribution have a significant impact on the wartime economy and the stability of people's livelihoods. Since being ordered to carry out this task, the staff of the Cotton Control Committee have been approaching it with the utmost caution and vigilance. They hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance, and especially hope that cotton merchants in various regions will work together with a sense of shared interests to complete this great mission.</p>

<h3>Zhongbei Basketball Team Withdraws from Xiqing Games, Huaying Fights Valiantly but Loses to Renyu</h3>
<p>The Xiqing Games basketball matches unfolded brilliantly last night. Not only were the Group A battles exciting, but the two Group B matches were also intense. In the opening act, the Zhongtie team defeated the Yi team with a score of 29-24. Zhongtie dominated the first half with a score of 16-5. In the second act, Group B's Youlian faced the Hualian B team. In the first half, the two teams were evenly matched, ending in a 9-9 tie. Youlian relied on a free throw by Huang Fengjia to win by one point, 15-14. In the first Group A match, Huanan faced Tongren. The first half ended in a 16-16 tie. Huanan unleashed its power in the second half, while Tongren's Zhang Banglun exhausted his energy. Huanan went from a tie to a major victory, 42-27. The headline match was Huaying against Renyu. Huaying played well in the first half. Liu's long shots and half-court shot were particularly impressive. Huaying was only behind by one or two points and even tied the score at 19. At the end of the first half, Renyu led 25-19. Huaying was exhausted in the second half, but the battle was still intense. Renyu won 51-45. Tonight, in a Group B match, the E team will face Lingyou at 8:00 PM. Zhongbei's withdrawal from Xiqing is regrettable.</p>

<h3>Commentary: The Opinions of Advisor Ishiwatari</h3>
<p>When the National Government's Supreme Economic Advisor, Shōtarō Ishiwatari, met with reporters in Nanjing on the 30th, he expressed his personal opinions on the National Government's implementation of economic planning policies after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, regarding the direction of economic development of the National Government. His most concise remarks were: "The National Government's economic policies should focus on increasing production, while also paying attention to consumption savings and waste recycling. These two points are important ancillary issues in wartime production... Furthermore, the work of stabilizing people's livelihood during wartime is also essential; under the wartime system, the people should repeatedly practice frugality to achieve stability in their wartime lives." Advisor Ishiwatari also stated that the National Government had sought his advice on this matter and would make every effort to offer relevant opinions for reference. His sincere words and dedication were deeply admired.</p>
<p>Why are conserving consumption and waste recycling important ancillary issues in wartime production? Because the phenomenon of insufficient materials during wartime is unavoidable. The way to remedy this is to not only increase production, but also to conserve materials. Otherwise, if one side is working hard to produce while the other side is spending extravagantly, putting unlimited consumption together with limited production means there would be no prospect of increasing production. Moreover, the opposite of frugality is extravagance. The trend of extravagance will cause a portion of manpower, materials, and financial resources to be sacrificed for unnecessary production, such as the manufacturing of luxury goods. In addition, there are those who waste materials, treating waste like worn-out shoes, without any regard for conservation. They do not realize that waste can be utilized, especially waste related to manufacturing raw materials, such as scrap iron, scrap cloth, and even waste paper, all of which should be preserved. We have repeatedly spoken about the relationship between conservation and the wartime economy. Now, because of Advisor Ishiwatari's remarks, we reiterate our point and sincerely hope that the entire country will follow suit. If the government authorities deem it necessary, they may even enforce it.</p>

<h3>Various Problems in the Business Coordination Committee's Work Entering the Second Stage</h3>
<p>Review of Autonomous Characteristics: Recently, a faction is clamoring that in order to complete the policy of material control, the cooperation between the government and the Business Coordination Committee is more important than ever. From past experience, the maximum operating strength of the Business Coordination Committee is that the guiding and supervisory powers between the Business Coordination Committee, the Ministry of Industry, the Food Department, and the provincial and municipal economic bureaus are not very clear, and there are many differences in each other's policies and powers. In addition, the Review Committee is also involved. We hope that all plans and programs, except for the policies determined by the National Government, should be undertaken by the Business Coordination Committee. This kind of policy will inevitably be adopted in the future. If it is as it is now, it is difficult to expect better results.</p>
<p>Guidance of National Capital and National Capital: The purpose of the Business Coordination Committee is to make national capital assist national goals. The capital centered on Shanghai developed in a relationship of mutual utilization with the government before the incident, but it has a tendency to reject political power. This tendency is now also a powerful reason hindering China's economic recovery. The Business Coordination Committee also noticed this point. By cooperating with the Central Bank to prepare to collect purchase funds and use bills, mobilize national capital, eliminate malicious capital as much as possible, and revitalize national capital with national capital, it has also been considered.</p>
<p>Integration of Economic Policies: The organization and activities of the Business Coordination Committee tend to be isolated, because it lacks integrated relations with general economic policies. Therefore, in order to operate smoothly in the desired organization and fully exert its functions, at least with other financial and production aspects, there should be a cohesive relationship and unified control. This is not only an internal issue, but also has the same relationship with the outward trade with North China and South China.</p>
<p>New Directions for the Future</p>
<p>If the various problems described above cannot be fundamentally solved, it will be difficult to expect progress in the future operations of the Business Coordination Committee. Therefore, future policies cannot promote the power of the Business Coordination Committee. The recent changes in various agencies of the National Government also have expectations for future operations. From this point of view, the relationship between today's business community and the National Government is even closer. Therefore, the Business Coordination Committee has now left the initial stage and entered the second stage of achieving its true purpose. (Translated from the Continental News)</p>

<h3>North China and Mengjiang Under Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Two years have passed since the outbreak of the war for the liberation and independence of East Asia. With the integrity of its sovereignty after participating in the war and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, New China, under the grand goal of a period-defining collaboration between the two countries, is marching towards the common completion of the Greater East Asia War. A reporter recently joined a delegation of North China and Mengjiang inspection reporters sent by the China Reporting Department, which lasted about 20 days. Departing from Nanjing, they traveled through various places in North China such as Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Beijing, and Tianjin, as well as various places in Zhang such as Datong, Zhanghe, and Zhangjiakou, inspecting the situation in various places under the decisive battle. The following is a report on the actual situation in North China and Mengjiang as seen from Central China, examining and linking them to the various problems currently encountered by the National Government, and reporting on the fact that Central China and North China have become one, and are on the path to victory, in the Chinese decisive battle system:</p>
<p>Concentrate Efforts to Increase Production</p>
<p>After completing the 4,000-kilometer journey, the most immediate impression was that all forces in the Chinese side, the Japanese side, and various departments are focused on increasing production, developing and increasing underground resources and surface resources, and are advancing without delay, immediately transforming into war power to destroy Britain and the United States. This goes without saying in Central China, and is the most important task. Whether from the perspective of the National Government's task of completing the "rear base" or from the mutual relationship of maintaining social order and stabilizing people's livelihood, it is an absolute requirement. In terms of increasing agricultural production, in addition to implementing the distribution of high-quality seeds, the inexpensive supply of agricultural tools and fertilizers, and large-scale on-site guidance to improve farming techniques, there is also the so-called Three-Year Construction Plan. Starting this December, the development of East Taihu will begin, which will provide considerable stimulus for increasing rice, wheat, and cotton production. As for underground resources, the 〇〇 Steel Plant, which combines the coal from the Huainan Coal Mine and the iron ore near Ma'anshan to start local steelmaking, began operations in September to reduce the burden of transportation.</p>
<p>In North China, the demand for this increase in production has an even greater task. For example, coal, a strong coking coal indispensable for steelmaking, is extremely abundant, and its deposit state is easy to mine. Moreover, its materials are one-third purer than Manchurian coal. It is planned to increase production by 〇〇 million tons each year, and the planned coal output this year is 〇〇 million tons.</p>
<p>Coal Mines Everywhere</p>
<p>Jingxing in Hebei Province, Datong in Xinjiang, Yangquan and Shouyang along the line in Shanxi Province, etc., are all black coal mines. In Japan, when miners enter the mine, they must take three cypress hammers, so visitors from Japan who saw the miners in this place break the mine with a heavy hammer were all amazed. Although there are unfavorable conditions everywhere, due to the abundant labor and sincere efforts, good results have been achieved.</p>
<p>This material cooperation can only be carried out with a strong political force as the main body. The New People's Society, the public guidance system in North China, is consistent with the inside and outside of the North China Political Affairs Committee, and is advancing towards the penetration of political power, the unity of public opinion, and the maintenance of order. At the first joint council meeting of the New People's Society after the National Government's participation in the war, which was held at the end of the month, the enthusiasm of North China was clearly visible. At that time, we happened to be visiting Beijing and attended as observers, and there was a lively discussion on specific plans for promoting the New Group People's Movement, increasing production, and suppressing the communists.</p>
<p>The Spirit of the New Citizen</p>
<p>Since the New Citizen Movement was established in Nanjing in July last year under the direct control of the New Movement Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, it has been rapidly launched. Due to the changes in the political structure after participating in the war in January this year, it was changed to the National Government. On the third anniversary of the return to the capital, the Chinese Youth Organization and the Chinese Youth Model Range were organized, and this was used as the center to promote a major national movement. North China also echoed this, paying attention to the organization and strengthening of the New People's Youth League, correcting thinking, reforming life, increasing production, and suppressing the communists. The four major goals of practicing the New Movement and the New Movement in the Central Government are spiritually united.</p>
<p>The important task in North China, which can be compared with the work of rural villages in Central China, is the work of suppressing the communists. The head of the New People's Society once stated that if the Chinese side's various policies and the Japanese army's suppression cannot destroy the communist organization, then order cannot be maintained, and it is impossible to engage in peacetime work. In order to engage in this work of suppressing the communists, the Communist Suppression Committee was organized in April this year to seek the integration of the North China Political Affairs Committee, the New People's Society, and the Peace Preservation Army. For example, the chief of the county serves as the chairman of the New People's Society's General Assembly, making the administration and the New People's Society an internal and external entity, and implementing work closely in cooperation with the Peace Preservation Army, setting up model areas, etc. These methods have been quite successful.</p>
<p>Because of the new policies towards China this spring, the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese staff in the New People's Society caused temporary turmoil. But soon it embarked on a fundamental track, with the Chinese side's automatic creativity and the Japanese side's good-faith support, advancing in the direction of promoting and strengthening the decisive battle system. From August to the end of October, for three months, the North China New Construction Movement was launched, exerting political, military, New People's Society, and folk power to solve the current urgent problems. With a thorough understanding of the new policies towards China and the resolution of the food problem, especially in the strengthening of collection and distribution, a great contribution has been made, and the performance of wheat purchases has also exceeded the expected goal.

<h3>Parents Visiting Parks Beware of Children Being Deceived</h3>
<p>On November 20th, around 3:00 PM, I took my three daughters, Deshan, my five-year-old son, Dewu, and my young daughter, Delu, to the French Park. The two older children played ball on the large central lawn, while I was reading a book on a bench. My young daughter, only two years old, was eating a fruit next to my bench. After about a few minutes, I suddenly noticed that my daughter was gone. I looked around, but there were few people in the park, and since my daughter could barely walk, there was no way she could have wandered off. So, I ordered my two children to stay inside the park gate on Hualong Road, while I searched everywhere in the park. After about twenty minutes, I had searched everywhere without success, so I went to the park gate with my two children, intending to go home and ask if perhaps a relative or friend had played a joke and taken her home.</p>
<p>When I walked to the gate of Lafayette Road, I suddenly had a thought, so I turned back and walked towards the park restroom. As I approached the restroom, I saw a man and a woman coming towards me. The woman was carrying a child. My three daughters saw them and kept calling out, "Sister is here!" So I went forward and looked closely, and it was indeed my young daughter. So I asked the woman where she got the child, and she replied, "This child was crying alone in the park with no one leading her, so this gentleman and I looked for her family together but couldn't find them, so we were planning to take her to the police station to be claimed." Then, she asked me if I recognized the child. Since my three daughters had already called out, they knew they had been exposed and immediately handed me my daughter, blaming me for not being careful. Then, the two of them calmly parted ways, each going their own way, as if they didn't know each other.</p>
<p>I was eager to wake up my young daughter, but she was still fast asleep. So I tried all sorts of methods, pinching her nose and covering her mouth. She moved slightly due to the stuffiness, but she was still not awake. I kept calling out for over thirty minutes before she finally opened her eyes, but she was still not conscious. After another three or four minutes, she finally started crying. I immediately asked my young daughter, "Did someone you didn't know carry you? What did they do to you?" My young daughter said, "They gave me a piece of candy." So I knew that the candy must have contained sleeping pills. I regretted not detaining the two people and calling the police, as it might have uncovered other abduction cases. I hope that all parents who visit parks will be cautious and careful. I also hope that police officers will closely question anyone who is crying or carrying a sleeping child, in the hope of solving a case. (Lu Xiaofen)</p>
<h3>Jinghong Elementary School Students Aid Child Victims of Disaster</h3>
<p>It was a Saturday afternoon with tight, northwest winds. Our entire school of children, led by our teachers, lined up in formation to visit the Shanghai Orphanage for Child Victims of Disaster on Laoli Yu Road. Alas! It would have been better not to visit; the visit made us feel too saddened! Because in such cold weather, they were only wearing tattered, padded clothes, some were even barefoot, and at night they only had thin quilts filled with clumps of cotton to cover themselves! As for what they ate every day, we heard that it was always a mixture of sweet potatoes, pearl barley flour, and other coarse grains, and sometimes when supplies were cut off, they had to go hungry for a meal or half a meal. Although they are now in the orphanage, with seven or eight enthusiastic teachers nurturing and educating them like loving mothers, living as if they were one big family, if the general public does not provide them with a continuous stream of aid, everything will be over.</p>
<p>We are a group of children with meager strength but ardent enthusiasm to help them. Therefore, after we returned to school, we immediately launched a "Campaign to Aid Child Victims of Disaster," vowing to save the money our parents gave us for sweets and put it together. After more than a week of effort, we accumulated five hundred thirteen yuan and twenty cents in Central Reserve Bank notes, as well as seven pieces of old clothing, forty-seven pairs of old shoes, thirteen dozens of pencils, which the children obtained with their parents' consent, and more than five hundred miscellaneous items such as erasers and pens that had been piled up in the lost and found box for a long time without being claimed, and sent them all to the orphanage. Of course, this is a small amount of aid, not enough to be satisfactory. But we think: if the children of all elementary schools in our city can all participate in this "Campaign to Aid Child Victims of Disaster," then all the orphanages for child victims of disaster in the city will surely receive great help. Respectfully submitted by the entire student body of Private Jinghong Elementary School.</p>
<h3>China Dental Hospital Continues Preferential Treatment for the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>The China Dental Hospital sent a letter yesterday stating: "Previously, we offered free treatment certificates and preferential treatment certificates, and we have repeatedly received introductions of poor and sick patients to our hospital, which we have carefully treated and cured. We have now heard that the aforementioned treatment certificates have been distributed. In order to continue our great service, our hospital is offering fifty more free treatment certificates and fifty preferential treatment certificates. We hope for your strong assistance."</p>
<h3>Report on the Donation of Winter Clothing</h3>
