<h3>新道德的商榷</h3>
<p>昨論「新政治道德的實踐」，所提三個原則，都是期望於政府當局的，不過，我們研究歷史，大凡一時風氣少盛行，，一稱政治上或社會上的運動之開展與收效，由於當局自上而下的示範與倡導者居半，所謂「草上之風必偃」者也。而由於一般國民的自覺自發的實踐，所謂「由下而上」的造成一時風氣，亦居其半。大概在原始社會，或封建時代，特別以自上而下的倡導方式爲主，所謂「民可使由之，不可使知之」，就特別適應於信種時代。至於人文進化，以至近代，一般國民都已受到時代思潮的影響，自覺或非自覺地認識時代環境和自己的責任，於是也就可以形成一種力量，可以左右一時政治或社會的風氣。因此，就不能專靠政當局之倡導與示範，而且還要求一般國民之自覺自發，在矢忠國家擁護政府的前提之下，不輕放棄其督促監察之權。我們國家，一方面處在文明進步的新時代，而實際情形，與當代列强相較，其落後亦不容諱言，所以，我們認爲要確立新道德，仍以自上而下的形式爲主，同時政府應努力於國民新道德的培育工作，而國民中的「先知先覺」者，也應該多負一些責任，倡導力行力以期在民間造成新道德的風氣。如此上下相激勵，人人相勸勉，終可達到新道德的理想，完成復興國家的目的。</p>
<p>前提明瞭以後，我們再來說新時代國民道德的主要內容：</p>
<p>第一，是要由對家族的道德，發展到對國族的道德。過去中國的社會組織，二三千年來，都不脫「宗法」兩字，也就是所謂家族中心制度。實際上的道德中心，還只在對自已家族的責任，只要你對家族盡了責任，所謂一光前裕後」，便是了不得的人物，或爲歷代父兄對於子弟最大的期望，至於他們對國家是否盡了責任，倒並不怎麼重視。在過去國際關係極簡單的時代，這種以家族利害爲中心的道德觀，自然具有特殊的優點，不容一筆抹煞。可是，處於二十世紀的今天，特別是處於世界大戰與民族解放戰爭嚴重的時期，這種過度重視家族利益的舊道德觀念，自然是不再適應現實的需要了。我們不必消滅家族中心的舊道德，但是必須把他擴大，成爲以國家爲中心的新道德。因爲處在今日的大時代，每一個國民，都應覺悟家族的利益，應該從屬於國族的利益，人人懍然於「覆巢之下，寗有完卵」的古訓，人人具有「先國後家」的覺悟，人人都以實踐其對國家所貢的責任爲當前第一等道德，凡不利於國家民族之事，雖一時於個人身家有利而決不屑爲，凡有利於國家民族之事，則雖粉身碎骨而不甘退縮，這是我們所望於今日國人的第一等的新道德。</p>
<p>第二，是要由個人的私德，發展爲社會的公德。古往今來多少罪惡，無一不發源於只知爲個人利益打算。一般的說，如社會上的奸盜邪淫，作亂犯法，那一件不起於「一念之私」？人人心目中只知有我，不知有人，實在是社會進化與人類文明的最大敵人。儒敎之排斥楊朱之學，雖不免流於偏激，然正有其不得已處。我們今日雖然不必反對自尊自愛的個人主義的道德，我們也無意於倡導不顧現實的兼愛主義或空洞無物的世界主義的道德，但是爲着新社會的建設，爲着中國與東亞民族的解放，我們不能不呼籲國人由個人的私德，進而重視社會的公德，人人當以遵守公衆秩序及維護公衆利益爲做人的基本道德。凡是犧牲大衆的利益而利其一己的，一定要認爲社會的公敵。同樣的，凡是爲着公衆利益而不惜犧牲一己的名利，及不顧身家性命的，即所謂「捨己爲羣」是新道德的模範，應該受到社會輿論的推崇。這是我們所望於國人必須實踐的最重要的新道德。</p>
<p>第三，健全的體格，正確的人生觀和最低限度的國民敎育，也是今日我國人民必須具備的新道德的標準。我們推究當世先進國之强盛，與夫中國之衰弱，其緊要關鍵，就在於此。中國人民最大的缺點或弱點有三：一是體格衰弱；二是阿Ｑ精神，自我麻醉而陷於絕境；三是敎育程度之低下，人人不知天高地厚與夫時局演變，在糊塗中斷送了一生。最大多數的國民患了這三種毛病，其能不積弱積貧，眞可說是「無天理」了。針對這三種病態，我們首先要以健全的體格確定爲國民道德的第一個條件。其决，就得展開反阿Ｑ精神的運動，反對所謂「精神勝利法」，反對「自我麻醉」；反對誇大，虛浮，貪小便宜，玩小手腕；反對不分是非，不問眞偽；反對不顧實際，害怕認眞等種種習氣。提倡脚踏實地，認眞辦事，有朝氣有作爲的積極精神。最後，我們每一個國民，都應該接受最低限度的國民敎育，具備人生必不可少的基礎知識，具備正當的人生觀，明白時勢，了解自己的地位與責任。過去國人都不注重以上三者，今後我們必須以此三者爲國民基本的道德條件，那麼國家的一切的優良政策的實現，才有了保證。</p>
<p>新道德問題，是關係目前中國民族存亡的大問題。中國人民的新道德問題，是關係今後束亞民族互助與建設世界新秩序的大問題。我們是否能夠擺脫以前的惡習氣，排除當前一切障礙，而確立新道德的基礎，正是我國今後命運所繫的大問題。因此，我們認爲此時此地提出新道德問題，實具有非常重要的意義，希望大家共同努力，形成一時風氣，新道德的樹立，固然杲「百年之計」，不可求諸旦夕，然而我們輿論界固然不敢妄自菲薄，全國　達似乎更應急起直追，否則未來世界是否還有我們老大的中華民族的立足餘地，實在不能不是一大疑問！</p>

<h3>洞庭湖戰綫　日軍準備大舉進擊　陸空兩軍呼應巧妙作戰南縣四週到處進行圍擊</h3>
<p>東京十日中央電據湖南前綫十日來電，秘密行動中之日軍某某精銳部隊，於洞庭湖上與沿該湖北岸追擊渝軍之日軍南進各部隊相呼應，以舟艇若干艘，突行進擊，迂迴洞庭湖中央半島，九日晨於安鄕南方二十四公里之肯家灣等處一齊奇襲上陸成功，其他部隊攻破據守小汶鎭之渝軍第一七九師第五八九團陣地，更移轉銳鋒經木察湖，彭湖，東江湖，洞庭西湖，於九日晨進至天心湖，於南咀對岸之藕池運河支流地區展開勇敢之上陸作戰。九日正午自安鄉南下先遣陸上進擊部隊，將該地區徬徨中之渝第一六一及七七師退路完全遮斷，並對之加以猛攻。又日軍奇襲部隊自天心湖向九都河河口之三星湖前進，九日下午實行上陸進擊，該處渝軍崩潰已迫眉睫云。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據湖南前綫來雷，湖南前綫方面隨日軍陸空呼應巧妙作戰之進展，渝第一六一及七七師退路完全遮斷，並對之加以猛攻。又日軍奇襲部隊自天心湖向九都河河口之三星湖前進，九日下午實行上陸，沿九都河溯碔離自南縣方面南下之某部隊取得連絡，夾擊三星湖附近之渝軍暫編第五師主力，渝軍因日軍奇襲部隊突於洞庭湖西方出現，頓感狼狠，渝第二十九集團軍之崩潰，已迫眉睫云。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據湖南前綫十日來電，湖南前綫方面隨日軍陸空呼應巧妙作戰之進展，渝第二十九集團軍主力刻已瀕於崩潰狀態。日陸軍航空部隊九日以大編隊冒暴雨由某基地大舉出動，猛烈掃射企圖突圍之渝軍集團，予以重創。並由機上偵悉，因日機於七八兩日猛炸渝軍舟艇，渝軍由水路逃竄之企圖巳被澈底粉碎，日軍於南堤河汀家洲附近與敗殘渝軍在泥濘中到處展開壯烈白刃戰。又日機於七日八日兩日中猛炸渝軍舟艇所獲之詳細戰果如次：渝大型船三艘中彈焚燒，舟艇七十餘艘被擊沉，約七十艘受重創云。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據太行山南部前綫十日來電，日軍各部隊掃蕩（第二十四集團軍）殘部，前曾於山西省境山岳地帶猛追榜徨中之預隆吾所部（第四十軍）殘部，然根據俘虜所供，知該軍長四月三十日巳於陵川東北二公里之省境南嶺村附近被炸斃命。又據日軍嚴密調査結果，亦證明該軍長確被炸斃云。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據湖南前綫十日來電，日軍精銳部隊自對渝『第一百六十一師』主力展開猛攻後，刻正向南縣南方地區壓縮包圍。渝『第一百六十一師』主力約三千名因南縣已危在旦夕，乃於八日晨起沿九都大河一路向南方逃竄，但彼等因潛匿地已失，乃據守南縣西南十公里處之荷華市縣城，作最後之抵抗。但因渝軍不堪日軍之猛攻，乃不顧國際法，竟於八日夜至十日晨使用毒瓦斯，以作最後之掙扎，但日軍均備有科學裝備，故渝軍結果終被殲滅。</p>
<p>湖南前綫十日中央社電　日軍各部隊以肖家灣三仙湖等爲中心，搆成直徑僅有十公里之包圍圈，將渝軍　入，刻正逐漸縮小包圍圈，到處圍擊，由某方面前進之日軍，在荷華市附近擊破頑抗之渝軍後，繼又擊潰據守班咀（南縣西南二十公里）之渝軍八百人，現又在三仙湖方猛追渝軍殘部約三千人。又由白埠口方吻追擊之日軍，於九日拂曉與溯長河航行之水上機動部隊，在永安境（白埠口東南二十二公里）附近圍攻渝殘軍一團約千二百人，予以巨創。又進抵江家洲附近之日軍水上挺身奇襲部隊一部，亦向集結於汀家洲南面之渝軍大隊展開奇襲，刻正猛烈痛擊中。</p>
<p>湖南前綫十日中央社電　日軍在梅田湖（南縣北方十五公里）附近現在繼續掃蕩渝第二十九集團軍殘部，八日晚復襲擊由王家藥舖（南縣西北十五公里）方面企圖逃逸之渝軍約三千人予以重創。</p>
<p>湖南前線十日中央社電　日軍於九日晨曾突向南縣某面開始猛攻，該處渝軍猝不及防，日軍即以破竹之勢，向南猛進，又丸日都運河南進之日船艇機動部隊，亦與此相呼應，着着進擊，遂於當日下午四時攻抵市縣城內。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　據習冀豫省境前綫十日來電，日軍於六日一齊開始行動後，東進部</p>
<p>到處擊潰日軍之抵抗，勢如破竹，九日晨巳與西進部隊會師，並聯向嚮堂鋪石靦（涉縣西十公里）虎山（涉縣凍北十公里）井店（涉縣東六公里）茨村（涉縣南五公里）等地區結成東西十　公里南北十五公里之包圍網，將該地之共軍包圍，日軍各部隊分路由嚮堂舖方面準攻，國　山西剿日軍　嚮堂舖北方方三街方面進攻，另日軍一部由石門方面進攻，西進之日軍則由井　虎山方面進攻，在此包圍圈內之共軍，　完全成爲袋中之鼠，消滅僅爲時問題。</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　中國軍事視察團團長葉蓬上將曾以「日本之勝算」爲題，向祖國同胞作報告廣播，指出此次在日考察軍事所得結論，確信日本必可獲得勝利，此項演說係於八日夜由此間電台以錄音廣播，並於二三日內由南京中央電台再行廣播，茲錄其大意如次：「兄弟同軍事視察團同仁奉主席的命令，派到日本觀光，短短的十幾天，雖然看了很多的處所，究竟是日本的一鱗一爪，就是觀察所得，或者不得要領，或者不甚準確，像這樣向國人報吿日本決戰態勢下的情形，實在感覺慚愧，今天向國人廣播報吿的，只是日本具有勝算的情形，茲用概括的方法，將所得印象同觀感簡單地分開來說：（甲）日本的基本條件，我的見解以爲日本是先有他的基本條件，而後產生他的決勝條件，所以先要舉出日本的基本條件，就是（一）精神文明與物質文明合一，近代世界各國中偏於精神文明的國家，不適應現代環境，必致落伍，像我們中國便是此例。偏於物質文明的國家，麻醉於功利生義，必致陷於想像，英美各國便是此例。我今觀察日本認定世界上唯有日本能將精神文明與物質文明合而爲一，而保持東方的精神文明，一面趕上西方的物質文明，融合貫通，這也是中庸之道的精神。（二）「一生懸命」的精神，「一生懸命」精神譯爲華文便是拚命的精神，日本人並不比他國人聰明，日本人並不比他國人强壯，但是他們都「一生懸命」，只有「一生懸命」便無事不成，便無敵不克，只要看他們對於現代機械拚命的研究，便終於得到了改良，反而爲他國所不及，這就是日本國民一生懸命的成就。（三）「隨分報國」，日本國民不是在前　報國便是在後方報國，所謂勞工報國，生產報國，乃至文化報國，生育報國等等，無論男女老幼，無論兵工商農，皆以報國爲念，皆以報國爲事，每一國民，每一動態，全在報國的高潮之中，這方是眞實的「隨分報國」，而且是一致的隨分報國。在人力上，假若只論數量，那是很大的錯誤，兄弟以爲以上三種條件，乃是日本精神，同日本國力的原素和原動力，所以稱爲日本的基本條件。（乙）日本的決勝條件，所謂決勝條件，乃是現代作戰國家所必需的條件，日本在那些必需條件上，有如下各條（一）「烟囱如林之國」，在近代設有烟囱少的地方是殖民地，烟囱多的地方是富强之邦，這是常識，我們一踏進日本國境時，便見烟囱如林，煤烟蔽空，尤其經過大阪·神戶一帶，比比皆是，據說大阪一市有名的烟囱便有三萬，無名烟囱未可數　，日本全境之烟囱是日本富强之籌碼。（二）「由高度工業而成高度武裝化」，現代陸海空軍的建築，不在營房艦艇飛機塲，而在軍需工廠，日本早經高度工業化，至戰事工廠轉變其軍需品生產能力，無論敵性宣傳如何，實不在英國或美國之下，所以日本的陸海空軍裝備完善，向不待論，而日本全國在一切國防設防設置上，或防禦體系上，構成了完善的高度武裝化。（三）（軍事資源自足），現代軍事資源之重要，自不待論，日本旣有多量的籌備積蓄，而日方更有豐厚的佔領土地，如南洋各地，雖戰時交通，在任何國家有不免艱難，而日本各工廠，於大量生產之下，絕無原料不足之象。（四）「生活產資之不缺乏」，一面努力生產，一面厲行節約的日本，其成就至爲驚人，在交流物資上，不特本土生產，而來源尤多，縱稍浪費，亦無可不足，然而日本厲行節約，在統制分配上，極爲得法，而分配均勻刻苦一致，尤爲難得，如此做出其生活物資，將永無缺乏之虞。（五）「財政金融之穩定」，日本國民儲蓄與政府預算及公債消化等情形，日本財政雖在戰爭高度中，亦極穩定，更無通貨膨脹貨幣貶値之徵象，總之，決戰態勢下的日本、業經將其全國構成了一座整個的偉大的堅强的大兵營，任何人，任何物，任何事，全在兵法部之下而編成，實巳做到了大衆戰，全體戰的極則，日本全民以此必勝之條件，構成必勝之信念，我認大東亞戰爭之完遂，實巳無甚問題。我國同胞，在主席領導之下，爲同情於大東亞民族解放戰爭，爲求解脫次殖民地地位，爲遵行大亞洲主義之遺敎，而斷然參戰與盟邦協力，雖然是成敗利鈍在所小計，然而聽到兄弟所報吿日本具有勝算的情形，當然有同盟共獲勝利的快感而更加協力，同跑們，我們不僅誓當爲大東亞全體戰而更加協力，還須採栽短，以與日本同負擔建設東亞，新秩序的責任。</p>

<h3>印緬邊境奏大捷　日軍佔領布其頓</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營五月十日下午五時三十分發表：日陸軍部隊於五月八日下午七時突入馬酉河上游之布其頓，經激戰後，即將其佔領，現正掃蕩殘敵中。</p>
<p>印緬國境南部最前綫十日電　日軍爲擊破英印軍在印緬國境甫部方面之蠢動，乃在馬西河畔展開攻勢，以巧妙之密林作戰，保待戰局主動地位，自荊棘滿布之惡路中猛烈進攻，遂於十日下午七時突入敵軍最後據點之布其頓而將其佔領，進迫印緬國境二十公里。當日軍於五月四日排除敵軍頑抗施行壯烈之夜襲後，即攻占布其頓西方五公里之要衝，是役敵軍遺屍一五〇具，並遺棄汽車卅輛·馬三百匹·及其他軍械彈藥等後，即向布其頓方面敗退，於是連結季多布其頓之敵軍兵站綫即被切斷，布其頓巳陷於孤立。敵軍因往孟大之退路已斷，遂倉皇向布其頓潰走，以此爲據點，集結兵力圖作最後抵抗，日軍乃奮勇追擊，繼續猛進。而日軍另一部隊於五月六日突繞道馬西河上遊進擊布其頓東方十公里處，如此兩路互相呼應，終乃突入布其頓。敵軍前曾以布其頓爲進攻緬甸久據點，故併力防守，當時兩軍砲聲隆隆，震撼馬西河畔，布其頓市街因受日軍猛烈砲擊，火光衝天，情景至爲慘烈云。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社　日軍精銳部隊前脅於印緬邊境印典方面擊潰英印軍主力使其奪回日溪之企圖遭受挫折，茲復繼續轉戰於酷熱之山野，猛攻印緬邊境馬酋河左岸敵據點布頓，經激戰後即將其完全佔領，此事業於十日由日大本營公布。按日軍此次所佔領之布其頓，位於印典以北約四十公里之印緬邊境，乃英軍要地，自英軍自去年爲圖奪回緬甸進擊日溪以來，即成爲其重要之兵站基地，英印軍在日溪方面作戰失敗後，乃在布其頓鞏固陣地，並在附近集結相當兵力，包括生力軍數旅團，其他殘軍企圖向日軍反攻，於昨日軍乃以布其頓爲中心，由馬酋河畔左右兩岸開始圍攻，而擊破英軍之新企圖。英印軍夢想奪回緬甸欲圖開始蠢動，經由此次日軍再予打擊，其企圖乃被完全粉碎</p>

<h3>戰時中國現狀　座談會　譯自「改造」五月號　（一）</h3>
<p>日期　三十二年四月九日</p>
<p>地點　東京帝國旅館</p>
<p>出席者　陳公博　大川周明　橘　樸　松本重治　山本實彥</p>
<p>山本：其次，關於各項專門的事情，我想大川君，橘君，松本君，都有種種意見要說明的，不過我還要叩問一樁事情，那就是現在的儲備券或通貨的今後問題，和建軍問題。對於道類問題，將要作怎樣的處理。陳先生在中國是一個統制經濟的提倡者，所以對於這類經濟，財政方面的問題，一定有着想用種種新的組織施行於和平地區的高見的，現在就請陳先生來發抒一番吧。</p>
<p>陳：那末我就來回答這個。首先來講儲備券問題。照我的預想，最好是只讓一種的通貨流通。我以爲各種通貨同時存在，那是不行的。如諸位所知，現在華北的物資不向華中流動，同時，華中的物資也不向華北流動，經濟狀態，各自獨立。因爲物資不流動，所以，例如南京，上海一帶，希望得到華北出產的物資，經過種種交涉，好容易所希望的物資，有一點可以運過來了。於是必須滙款過去。但在匯款的時候，因爲通貨不祗一種之故，就發生匯價的變動和其他種種困難，結果，華北和華中的經濟，便被隔離開來。我以爲這也是今後兩國當局應該協力研究以謀如何解決的問題。</p>
<p>現在這個理想也漸漸見諸實現。例如：軍票已經停止發行，不過這問題，當然是兩國財政當局所研究的，我不是財政當局，所以只好就剛纔的質問，回答一點感想而已。</p>
<p>其次來講關於建軍問題。依我所想，精神敎育最爲重要，那是建軍的基礎；其次便是武器問題。現在南京已成立了中央陸軍學校，今年九月，可以造就第一屆畢業生。那班畢業生的成績，中日兩國的有關人士，對之都非常滿意。汪主席每星期必親臨訓話一次，每一個學生都常常能够聽到在主席的訓話，因此，他們瞭解着自己的責任。爲什麽要做軍人？做了軍人便應該做些什麽？——他們對於這種責任和目的，都非常明白。又對於國策，也徹底明白。像這樣，所以建軍的基礎是一天一天在鞏固着</p>
<p>然而留下的却是武器問題。現在各地方臨時施行着國軍的改編和訓練。不過臨時集合的軍隊，現在還只能担任治安的維持而已。然則怎樣才好呢？我以爲也還是應該由學校出身的多數舉業生，加入各軍隊，然後由着貴國的援助，以謀武器的充實。如果能够這樣，那末一定可使全國的軍隊，貢獻於大東亞戰爭。此點實多多有賴貴國的理解和援助。貴國在朝的人固不必說，在野的諸位，如也把國民政府的建軍，即所以謀貢獻於大東亞戰爭，現在正充分行着精神訓練，力謀鞏固目的，所以應助以武器——的言論，多多倡導，則國民政府的建軍問題，前途便大有希望。</p>
<p>其次是經濟統制問題。許多人都以爲經濟統制的原則，乃是收買而分配：我則以爲是實行有計劃的生產，把生產的物資收買攏來，然後把收買攏來的物資爲合理的分配。只要能够這樣順利而行，則經濟統制的目的就可達成。如把今日以前的統制經濟，一加考察，則知並不合於生產目的，而是一些非生產的經濟統制。又關於收買，也是無計劃的收買。如果要問：自從上月物資統制的新政策改善以後，中國已在作着有計劃的生產了嗎？——那末我便回答說：尙還沒有進入那個時期；但是，却可以說：已進入了有希望的階段。</p>
<p>生產政策的目的，是要有利於大東亞戰爭；這是生產的最大目的。以前，不過因爲地方已安定了，戰爭已停止了的緣故，所以來做做看而已，那成爲最大目的之有利於大東亞戰爭的生產，實還沒有做。不過現在却可以說，已經進入了那樣的醞釀時期，又所謂收買方法的沒有計劃，那就是今日以前是行着局部統制的，因此上海的物資不能運到蘇州去，蘇州的物資不能運到無錫去，互相處於血液小循環的狀態。然則在這次新政策實行之後，已經行着有計劃的收買了嗎？——講到這點，我可回答說：決沒有行到那樣的地步。不過在新政策改善以後，自然會達到這個地步。大家都說計劃雖然沒有樹立，但若新政策一施行，則物資必可自然收買。我以爲這種自然的收買是靠不住的，無論如何，國家必須樹立某種計劃，把戰爭所必要的物資，作通盤的打算，然後務使道戰爭所必要的物資，國家可在無論什麽時候，把它動用。還有非大東亞戰爭所必要的物資，應使流通於民間，以圖國民的生活安定——這種有計劃的收買，我以爲是應該施行的。</p>
<p>其次是有計劃的分配，一考察現在的配給狀態，則在中國還只行着米的配給一種，而且連其分配的方法，還沒有上軌道。然而那也並非沒有理由的。因爲關於物資統制的新政策，施行以來，還只經過二十天光景，自不能强求其能够急速實現的。所以經濟統制的眞正作用，不得不有待於其次的階段。</p>
<p>山本：橋君，您很忙，現在就請您先提出問題來吧。</p>
<p>橘：（對着大川氏）大川君，您有什麽問題嗎？</p>
<p>大川：沒有什麽。</p>
<p>橘：那末我就想提出關於經濟統制的問題來講講。我以爲由政府實施經濟統制，是有着非常重要的要素的。所以由國民政府來實行經濟統制時，政府的計劃縱如何完善，如巢在下面沒有和它相應的經濟施設或經濟機構，則機關就等於虛設。那種在下面順應政府的意圓而作用的力，在中國我以爲應該求諸鄕土社會裏的長老團，和以那長老團爲基礎之現在上海的民族資本家。中國的再建設，並不是單把經濟統制浸透於民間就算，其全體的工作，也還是非以中國的鄕土社會爲基礎不行的。此點，延安政權固不必說，就是重慶政權，我以爲也沒有能够傾注其力於此點的資格。有這種資格的，便是在精衛先生所指導的國民黨，和在其指導下的國民政府。一言以蔽之，就是國民政權。除此以外，沒有其他。我想我們應當盡可能以在野者的資格，貢獻其助力。關於此點，陳先生的意見，在期待統制經濟政策的浸透之上，對於構成鄉土社會之各級長老團及民族資本，有着怎樣的卓見呢？敬以此叩詢陳先生。</p>
<p>陳：關於這個問題，我們曾經屢行協議和詳加考慮過的。舉實例來說，這次已經組織了遂行物資統制新政策的機關——全國商業統制總會。這個機關決不是國民政府官吏的機關，完全是民間的經濟團體之組織，政府是沒有關係的，政府只不過授與方針加以指導而已。組織這全國商業統制總會的中心分子，是以上海的同業公會，或其他各地的同業公會來袒任的。而且在這商業統制總會之中，也有日本人的組織加入，即日本人的組織也成爲全國商業統制總會的一個細胞。所以這個機關組織得非常得宜。並且依照全國商業統制總會的主旨，可以實行關於物資統制的項目。因爲若不使民間理解物資統制的意義，則物資統制的組織，縱令創立了許多，民間也還是不會跟着而走的。那當然不行，所以非先使民間理解其意義不可，然而在使理解以前，不如先使實行，使其自己來行這件事，那是效果最速的辦法。</p>
<p>橘：實質的……</p>
<p>陳：因此創立了如上的民間組織，使民間自己去實行。所以那個機關，決不是政府單獨在施行着，政府不過站在指導的地位，自動實行其事的，乃是民間。</p>
<p>橘：那是好極啦。所以像剛纔所說，無論是國民黨或國民政府，正是依着全國民之實質的自主的自動的熱誠，建設新中國，進而趨向於大東亞建設的。然而在其前，成爲國民政權大事業之對手的，我以爲實在就是鄉土社會，那是剛綫所說的長老團及民族資本家的基礎，也是他們的地盤。如此說來，那末所謂鄉土社會，實在是中國再建設的生命，是政治力的淵源。這樣重要的根本，孫中山先生曾經是怎樣地把握着的呢？——這個問題，一翻孫先生遺存的文獻來看節裏，便可以看到所謂中國社會，實是以家族成爲其非常重要之基礎的。家族相集，成爲宗族，宗族相集，便成爲民族。因此如要把一盤散沙般的中國國民，團結成一個强靭的民族或國家，就必須鞏固那作爲家族和民族的媒介之宗族。這樣的話，洋洋佔了五六頁之多，從種種之點，就宗族之合理的組織化問題，加以論述。所以我以爲孫先生所把握着的，就是這個意思。陳先生的府上也是廣東嗎？</p>
<p>陳：是的。</p>
<p>橘：孫先生也是廣東。在廣東和福建一帶，那方面所謂宗挨，它的勢力是非常大的；司是漸漸到了北方，所謂宗族的勢力，也就跟着，無論是政治的，經濟的，都衰退下來了。朋以，就廣東和福建來說，完全和孫先生所說一樣，然而更往北方，便不是那成爲血緣社會的宗族，而是史加廣泛意味之把而綵社會包括在內的鄉土社會。中國古語有所謂「鄉黨」這句話，在我們日本說來，就是鄉土社會。因此孫先生所說的宗族　如用更廣義的話來說，我以爲不如用鄕黨或鄉土社會稱之，更易明白。這樣一來，則孫先生的民族主義，其實現結果之强靭的——不是散沙般的——民族及國家社會，不是由鄉土社會而成的嗎？</p>
<p>陳：要講三民主義的話，那是說來很長，一時講不盡的，現在且把其中的一部分有關於尊詢之點的，來說一說，中國社會，是以農業社會爲基礎的，而且也可以說是以農業社會爲主的。不消說，農業社會是以家爲最重要。家實是最被重視的。與家有關係的人，都看做是家族，住在同一建築物中的人，當然就是家族，然而和它有關係的許多人，雖不住於其家，也是解釋爲家族的。在中國的農業社會裏，重視家族，實是非常合理的。</p>
<p>在北方，散在於這邊那邊的村落很多，南方則有許多成爲集團的村。而且在南方，一個村裏，往往住有幾千人，幾萬人，成爲集團；北方則並不如此。因爲道個緣故，孫文先生便想設法使中國的國民，實現民族的團結，可是却沒有可以解釋它的話。因爲中國人是以家爲主的，於是就從家族說起。然後漸漸把家族，宗族，民族，說得容易使人明白。或者在這家族之中，包含着北方的所謂鄉土的意義，也未可知。再說得大一點，便是宗族·總之，從家族說起，是因爲中國以家爲重之故，想由家以結成民族，因此由家族，宗族方面，以强調民族的觀念。</p>
<p>橘：是的。</p>
<p>陳：又爲供參考起見，更舉出一個例來說。中國的西北，現在共產黨的勢力非常大。然而共產黨實行其政治時，却努力以不執行違背中國社會的傳統爲方針。凡是反對家族的事是不幹的。因此也掛着以家族爲基礎的民族主義的招牌。所以在這次戰爭開始時，共產黨便掛起「看吧，日本人到中國來，是反對我們民族主義的，因此我們大家戰吧！」那樣的招牌，而行其共產政治。北方人，都有着相同的觀念。尤其是農民，以至市民，都有着這樣的觀念。因此，譬如有人沒收了某人的田地，縱令只沒收了一個人的田地，也會發生如次的影響。那便是：某人的兄弟不必說，其祖其父，其他諸親戚，故舊或堂兄弟，或從數十代之前分岐過米的同姓人們，此等人，都會對於那個田地被奪的某人表同情。譬如某人的田地是被共產黨奪去的，則和該人有關係的許多人，都要反對共產黨。又假定某人的田地是被軍隊奪去的，則住於其家的一家族，固不必說，而與其有親戚關係的一切之人，都對該某人寄與同情。原來是有着這樣狀態的。</p>
<p>想出這樣道理來的，便是孫中山先生，他認爲若先把家這個主義把握住，則民族這個主義，就可加以强調。因此便從家說起，而實現了這所以鞏固一國的淵源之政策。</p>

<p>當此敎師生活困苦達於極點之際，忽聞財政部所得稅處明令抽收敎師所得稅，據上海區徵收局所發各校之通告稱，乃根據「第二類自由職業及其他從事各業者薪給報酬所得」之條例，故敎師亦應抽所得稅。並謂：自二十一年一月起，至本年四月底止，應出之所得稅，卽須補扣；五月起即開始每月扣除解交中儲行云云，實與敎師以一大打擊。蓋敎師受投機囤積者壓榨，實巳不能維持生活。試執道路三尺童子而問之；「今日何等人爲最苦」？必能答以「坐冷　凳之敎師」今日各級學校敎師，薪水無不微薄，每月所入，僅用以付房金，買米麵，及極簡陋之菜蔬而已；旣無餘金購書報，亦無餘力添衣襪；無論精神生活，物質生活，均巴無法獲得滿足。政府爲此曾設法救濟，社會人士亦紛紛表示同情，或免費洽病，或館殺助金，含意不外乎此。敎師所以願含辛茹苦，繼續執教者，亦無非爲維護敎育事業，使國家民族之元氣，不致斷傷耳！雖亦偶有一二以營利爲目的之校長，但敎員實一無過失；雖亦偶有少數敎員兼營投機囤積，但多數敎員尚能刻苦自勵，專心致力於敎管學生。故今日而猶欲抽敎師之所得稅，無異逼敎師走上死亡之路，使敎育　業趨於崩潰。故敎師實不能與一般自由職業者作一例看，在此薪給不能與物價同時飛漲之情勢下，敎師尤其不能與一般自由職業者作一例看。我人相信愛獲敎育事業之財政當局，定能洞悉此情而與敎師以暫免所得稅之優待。</p>
<p>更有不能已於言者：即通告上令學校補扣敎師自三十一年一月至本年四月底之所得稅，實堪駭異！按徵收局所附之「每月應納稅額計算表」所載稅率，極爲詳盡，不及一一鈔錄。茲假定以月薪五百元論，每月需扣五元五角，自三十一年一月至本年四月，共有十六個月，卽需袖扣二百四十八元；此數相等於其半個月之薪給，試問此半月之生活將如何維持？故深望財政當局亦能免除　十六個月之所得稅。</p>
<p>千千萬萬正待救濟之敎師，獲悉須扣聽得稅並須補扣十六個月所得稅之通吿後，必將惶恐不安。敎師所得稅如不能暫免扣除，則敎師生活必將更趨入困境財政當如能體恤敎師生活之淸苦，而明令暫免扣除，則敎師幸甚！敎育幸甚矣</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>二次澈查商品囤積</h3>
<p>國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郎氏，視察上海方面最近經濟狀况以後，曾於前日向新聞記者表示：『至於囤積問題，當然應取斷然處分之措置爲宜。『這樣一個『要言不煩』的表示，恰爲最近兩個月來，人民對於政府迫切的要求。</p>
<p>可是，澈査商品囤積問題的最近新發展則爲：『國府日前巳派第二批要員赴滬，澈査商品囤積，並決心懲治囤積犯，』而『滬經濟界亦深盼此次調査，能有比較更具體之事實出現，俾能協力於國府戰時經濟政策。」我們認爲第一次澈査囤積的結果，祗可把它當作陳　；現在重新做起，實宜對症發藥，不必拘泥於『覆診須帶原方」的一個習慣；換句話說，就是這次澈査，『要在絕不徇私，破除情面；如果應罰者愈有背景，就愈要重罰。』我們希望第二次澈査非法囤積，能够根據這樣一個大公無私的精神做去。那末，雷厲風行之下，政令就不難終於買澈了。</p>
<p>其次，關於這次續派要員來滬澈査囤積，『一部份經濟界人士，甚希望調査節圍再爲擴大，並希望能對出產棉絲棉布之工廠，施以監督·』這樣一個意思表示的解說，就是淸除囤積，治標還須治本：治本的捷徑，便是全面倉庫棧房積存商品的登記，使囤積者根本上失其隱蔽的屛障，那末，雖欲從中取巧，亦覺無由作祟了。好在政府「現以實業部爲中心，對登記法令，正在硏究中，一俟審査終了，即將由國府明令公布。」凡此種種，——包括『主要商品囤積治罪條例』——均須兌現切實施行，是爭第一要義·昨招待新聞界報吿籌組經過</p>

<h3>消滅投機的根本對策（二）</h3>
<p>— 錫林</p>
<p>（四）全面的限價，不容冉綏。過去的地域限價，不足再取。現今物資移動限制緩和後，全而限價，更屬急要。因爲，由於囤積的澈査，物價的限定，投機者便將利用物資移動限制的緩和，將物資向價格高處，和取締鬆處移動，則物資的移動，在根本上，就是破壞統制制度。故對於囤積的取締，和價格的限定，宜全國一致，乃能收效。全面的限價，應由國府當局根據各物出產地的生產成木，厘定一公定的價格，使各地均以此爲標準，並且要參酌各該地的特銷狀况和運費等，加以適當的堆减，以爲各該地的公定價格。</p>
<p>（五）人民對於統制的認識，和對於消滅囤積的合作，更不容怱視。上述的四端，都是利用政府的權力，以爲囤積的消滅，然而僅利用政府的權力，以幹此艱難的工作，是不够的，此外，必須有賴於人民的合作，則推進自能順利。對於人民方面，可分兩方面說：第一，須擴大宣傳，使人民對於統制有明確的認識，以消除過去的誤解。並積極激勵人民的愛國心。使其明瞭戰時人民應負的責任，心理的矯正，認　的充實，亦足以减少投機囤積的發生，第二，投機業已瘋狂，國積業已猖獗之際，　澈　起見，便須借功於人民的合作，對於此點，宜注意下列的數端：（甲）强化人民的組織，藉以加强政府與人民的連繫關係；（乙）發起「囤虎撲滅週」，引導人民與政府的通力合作，共同參加撲滅囤積的鬥爭；（丙）獎勵人民的檢舉；（丁）利用保甲制度，使人民間相互監視，由保甲長負實調査各家庭的存貨，是否超出正常需要；如有囤積或超過正常需要的發現，即須報吿當局，否則保甲長亦須受嚴重的處罰。此於囤積的消滅，亦有重大的幫助。</p>
<p>總之，投機圃積非澈底消滅和根本剷除不可，否則，非但經濟的騷擾，將不堪設想，即在政治上，恐亦將有不良的後果，切盼常局不再忽視其嚴重性，不再有「捉了小魚放了大魚」等等敷衍塞責的舉動。</p>

<h3>不要糟蹋自己</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>營養不良，心境不佳，種種因，足以使人容易衰老，容易憔悴，甚至容易死亡。這情形尤其在戰後特別顯得嚴重。但是除了營養與心境之外，有很多人不知潔身自愛之道，隨便把寳貴的精神體力加以蹧蹋，以致形態萎靡，病象畢露　却也是普遍的事實。</p>
<p>自從有了囤積投機之類的猖獗，都巿中的風氣，更見其犬馬聲色的充斥，蹧蹋之所，隨處皆是，諸如通宵達旦的方城之戲，樂不思蜀的尋花問柳，太白遺風的放量豪飲……這類玩意，不要　在豪華者是家常便飯，就是在一般塲合，也有如瘋如在的風氣。嚴格說來，如此取　尋歡的方式，給與心身上的蹲蹋，實在是非常厲害的。</p>
<p>大概飽暖終日無聽用心的人，不免溺情嗜好，習於流連，特別容易向蹧蹋的路上走。雖然有錢吃得到富有維他命的養料，並且可以常服補品，但是日常蹧蹋的人，補充與消耗相抵，無論如例，是「得不償失」的，這就是因爲蹧蹋的結果，會遂漸使你神經麻痺，肌肉鬆弛，新陳代謝的機構失其正常的效能的關係。無怪乎照優生學講起來，凡是養尊處優的人，由於「玩日廢時」，過慣了醉生夢死的生活，其精神智慧體力等等，大抵是薄弱無能的居多。</p>
<p>一個人的體弱與多病，自然有關於先天的不足或後天的失調，以及經濟等等複雜的原因，但是對於平均發育調和身心的體育，漠不關心，從不鍛鍊，也是大半原因。至於旣不講究體育，還要隨便蹧蹋身心的人，那末傷志戕性的結果，受害更是無窮。我們看到有些人本來　健力强，精神飽滿，可是由於經常蹧蹋的影饗，不到一年半載，就頹廢不堪，前後判若兩人了，也有年方少艾，多跑些路或爬幾層扶梯，也會氣喘如牛，有時向地上拾取失落的東西，也會苦於彎腰側身的不便，更不興的簡直與希奇古怪的病魔結？不解之緣。</p>
<p>雖然對於身心並不踏蹋的人，在形式上也有面色蒼老的，但這大概是飽經　患或是「勞其肌膚，苦其心志」的關係。所以一個人在形式上即使蒼老一些，沒有大礙，祇要對於身心不加蹧蹋，而把寳貴的精神知能，用於利人利己的地方，那來心安理得，較之養尊處優而「外强中乾一之徒勝得多了。</p>
<p>在靑年　代的身心沒有糟蹋，祗有鍛鍊，其精神活力一定布沛，一定振作有爲，而旦到了年老，在精神身體方面，至少也可减少　多痛苦。但是要做到這　步，非抱有純正的即想不可，因爲惟有這樣才會認識　　重　遠」。</p>
<h3>「妒忌」與「放冷箭」</h3>
<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>「妒忌」好像已經根　蒂周地成爲社會上一般人的通病了。因了「妒忌」，社會上不知巳鬧過多少次的糾紛，多少次的不幸。但是「妒忌」却仍舊普遍地蔓延開來。</p>
<p>「妒忌」的人常常是不及人家的份了（並不絕對）。</p>
<p>「妒忌」心重的人，件往極度關懷着他人的事情。如果別人不成功，他便抱　　幸災樂禍」的態度冷眼旁觀，假使他人成就了，並且超過了他，那麼「妒忌」心便引起了。尋常會發生二種結果。</p>
<p>「妒忌」心的引起旣是爲了不及人家，所以目睹了他人的成功，便油然生發競爭一之心，想努力前進超　他人之前，至少亦得「並駕齊驅」。這是一種正大光明的結果，</p>
<p>「妒忌」的另一種結果，便截然不同。他努力拉尋成功者的某一種微小的錯誤，就使這錯誤像毫毛一樣地微小，祇嬰能够讓他「吹毛求疵」地「大放厥詞」。他就不惜用卑鄙手段放幾支冷箭，中傷他人……這種態度是要不得的。</p>
<p>我們年輕，我們需要充滿「熱忱」的人生，我們需要的是和藹可親的莊嚴的面孔。如果當我們才踏進社會，看見的都是奸刁巨猾，似笑非笑的面孔。大受挫折是當然的事。</p>
<p>雖然，一個人在成功之前總是要受些挫折的，但，這種故意形成的障礙，在健全的制度下，大可不必有。如果這世界上充滿着「放冷箭一式的「妒忌」，這世界不知要變成什麽了。</p>
<p>在電影院裏，二個靑年在適當的地位問隔的又佔了　個座位，中間空着一個，放上一張說明書。</p>
<p>老人，壯漢，靑年，孩子輪流的詢問。</p>
<p>「有人。」得着同樣的回答。一位漂亮的密斯走過來：「這裏……」</p>
<p>「沒人，沒人。請坐，請坐。」迅速，婉和，且又不的而同。</p>
<h3>知與行</h3>
<p>— 枕琱戈</p>
<p>二十八日本刊海倫君　下集的第一段，寫有「理論與事實完全是兩件事，又說，「所以我們要養成說了　做的習慣」。這裏我們得補充一下。</p>
<p>雖然，「單有理論，而不脚踏　地去幹」是「永遠不會成事實的」；但是，我以爲「單是脚踏實地　幹」，而沒有一理論」的指示，那就是盲目的幹。或許會有「山窮水盡疑　路，柳暗花明又一村」的，「大無絕路」的希望，可是，這種希望太渺茫了吧！無理論的幹的結果，說定亦小會「兌現」的吧。</p>
<p>「說了能做，在我們中國的「讀書人」（？）好像是「不屑」的；中山先生不是說：「知難行易」嗎，於是乎，　些「萬般皆下品惟有讀書高」的「讀書人」，就自認小「理論家」了，他們是祗負「理論」的建立，而不負實踐的責任的，「行」應屬於「萬般皆下品」的農商工兵的呀！所以什麼有意義的運動，都是祗聽樓板響，不見人下來」了。關於中山先生所說的「知難行易」，我們要認淸，中山先生吿訴我們，知道之後，——就是「理論」建立之後——祗要我們肯努力，肯犧牲，事情一定會成功的；不過，並不是知道了之後，事情就會自然而然成功的！這一點，我們不能不認消的！</p>
<p>所以，理論是實踐的張本，但實、　要依附着理論的。所以，我們要把「理論與事實」變成一件事，那就是「說了就做」，亦就是王陽明的「知行合」了。</p>

<h3>一個薪水階級的家庭生活</h3>
<p>— 建淸</p>
<p>大時代之變幻，如一幕戲劇，愈演愈爲緊張。發國難財者，貪心無厭之囤積操縱者，各施其技，層出不窮的拿手表演着，興高彩烈，莫此爲甚。然影於新水階級，已良苦矣，以　定收入，應付無限漲之黑市，維持不周，寅吃卯糧，罔論　積，所謂好　越好，難者愈難。筆者，昔年由商而入政途，遭　變之刧，衣物無遺，二十七年春，由鄉里米滬，依人作嫁，所人僅敷所出，大小七口，在四年前，滬居生活，尙能用一娘姨，差可維持溫飽，年來滬上生活之劇　，而人口又增添其二，衣　負擔，當然緊上加緊，娘姨早經辭去，家庭事務，自己苦幹，黎明即起，洒掃爭盂，生爐摺被，大小分工合作，諸孩事畢，盥洗早餐入學，耐　克苦之精神，從小間輟，本身方面瘁躬愼儉，烟酒嫖賭，絕不敢嗜犯，娛樂塲所，亦無暇涉足，祇以受時代生計之重重壓迫，目今每月薪津雖有一千二百元，以　數支　家庭用度，時感左支右絀，應付爲艱，祗以食米項，每月占薪金百份之七十：（因市區戶口米，按月不能依照規定配給，每月須添購黑巿米的八斗。）日用小菜，油糖雜費，占百份之五十五，房金學費，占百份之十五，（四孩入學）應酬·添置·醫藥·按月無標準，平均作百份之三十。</p>

<h3>Deliberations on the New Morality</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on "The Practice of New Political Morality" proposed three principles, all of which are expectations for the government authorities. However, in our study of history, we find that the prevalence of any trend, the commencement and effectiveness of political or social movements, are half due to the demonstration and advocacy of the authorities from top to bottom, as the saying goes, "The wind over the grass must bend." The other half is due to the conscious and spontaneous practice of the general populace, creating a trend "from the bottom up." Generally, in primitive societies or feudal times, advocacy from top to bottom was particularly emphasized. The saying, "The people can be made to follow it, but cannot be made to understand it," was especially suited to that era. As for the evolution of humanity, up to modern times, the general populace has been influenced by the trends of the times, consciously or unconsciously recognizing the environment of the times and their own responsibilities. Thus, a force can be formed that can influence the political or social atmosphere of the time. Therefore, one cannot rely solely on the advocacy and demonstration of the government authorities, but also requires the conscious and spontaneous action of the general populace, who, under the premise of loyalty to the country and support for the government, should not lightly relinquish their right to supervise and oversee. Our country, on the one hand, is in a new era of civilized progress, but in reality, compared with the great powers of the contemporary era, its backwardness cannot be denied. Therefore, we believe that the establishment of a new morality should still be mainly in the form of top-down leadership. At the same time, the government should strive to cultivate the new morality of the people, and those who are "the first to know and the first to awaken" among the people should also bear more responsibility, advocating and practicing to create a new moral atmosphere among the people. In this way, with mutual encouragement from above and below, and mutual exhortation from everyone, we can ultimately achieve the ideal of the new morality and complete the goal of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>With the premise clarified, let us now discuss the main contents of the morality of the people in the new era:</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to develop from the morality of the family to the morality of the nation. For the past two or three thousand years, the social organization of China has not escaped the two words "patriarchal clan," which is the so-called family-centered system. The actual moral center is still only the responsibility to one's own family. As long as you fulfill your responsibility to the family, the so-called "glorifying ancestors and benefiting descendants" is considered a remarkable achievement, or the greatest expectation of fathers and elder brothers for their children throughout the ages. As for whether they have fulfilled their responsibility to the country, it is not given much importance. In the past, in an era of extremely simple international relations, this moral view centered on family interests naturally had special advantages that cannot be completely dismissed. However, in the 20th century today, especially in a period of severe world wars and national liberation wars, this old moral concept that overemphasizes family interests is naturally no longer adapted to the needs of reality. We do not need to eliminate the old morality of family-centeredness, but we must expand it to become a new morality centered on the nation. Because in today's great era, every citizen should be aware that the interests of the family should be subordinate to the interests of the nation. Everyone should be awed by the ancient teaching, "When the nest is overturned, are there any intact eggs?" Everyone should have the awareness of "country first, family second." Everyone should take the practice of fulfilling their responsibility to the country as the foremost morality of the moment. Anything that is detrimental to the country and the nation, even if it is temporarily beneficial to personal wealth and life, should never be done. Anything that is beneficial to the country and the nation, even if it means self-sacrifice, should not be retreated from. This is the first-class new morality that we expect from the people of our country today.</p>
<p>Second, it is necessary to develop from individual private morality to social public morality. Throughout history, how many sins have not originated from only planning for personal interests? Generally speaking, such as social vices like adultery, theft, and lawlessness, which one does not arise from "a moment of selfishness?" Everyone only knows that there is self and does not know that there are others, which is really the greatest enemy of social evolution and human civilization. The rejection of Yang Zhu's philosophy by Confucianism, though inevitably tending to be extreme, has its necessity. Although we do not need to oppose the morality of self-respect and self-love of individualism today, and we have no intention of advocating an altruistic doctrine that ignores reality or an empty cosmopolitanism, for the sake of the construction of a new society, for the sake of the liberation of China and the East Asian nations, we cannot but call on the people to move from individual private morality to attach importance to social public morality. Everyone should take compliance with public order and maintenance of public interests as the basic morality of being human. Anything that sacrifices the interests of the public to benefit one's own must be regarded as a public enemy of society. Similarly, anyone who sacrifices his own fame and fortune for the sake of the public interest, and disregards personal safety, that is, the so-called "sacrificing oneself for the group," is a model of the new morality and should be praised by public opinion. This is the most important new morality that we expect the people of our country to practice.</p>
<p>Third, a healthy physique, a correct outlook on life, and a minimum level of national education are also the standards of the new morality that the people of our country must possess today. In investigating the strength of the advanced countries of the world and the weakness of China, the key lies in this. The biggest shortcomings or weaknesses of the Chinese people are three: first, a weak physique; second, the spirit of Ah Q, self-anesthetization that leads to desperation; and third, the low level of education, with everyone unaware of the immensity of the world and the evolution of the times, ruining their lives in confusion. The vast majority of the people suffer from these three problems, and it can truly be said that it is "unreasonable" if they do not accumulate weakness and poverty. In response to these three morbid states, we must first establish a healthy physique as the first condition of national morality. To achieve this, we must launch a movement against the spirit of Ah Q, oppose the so-called "spiritual victory method," oppose "self-anesthetization," oppose exaggeration, superficiality, greed for petty gains, and playing petty tricks, oppose not distinguishing right from wrong, not asking about truth and falsehood, oppose disregarding reality, and fearing seriousness. We must advocate a down-to-earth, serious approach to work, and an active spirit of vigor and achievement. Finally, every one of our citizens should receive a minimum level of national education, possess the basic knowledge essential for life, possess a correct outlook on life, understand the times, and understand their own position and responsibilities. In the past, the people of our country did not pay attention to the above three points. In the future, we must take these three as the basic moral conditions of the people, so that the realization of all the country's excellent policies will be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The issue of new morality is a major issue related to the survival of the Chinese nation at present. The issue of the new morality of the Chinese people is a major issue related to the mutual assistance of East Asian nations and the construction of a new world order in the future. Whether we can get rid of the bad habits of the past, eliminate all current obstacles, and establish the foundation of the new morality is a major issue that determines the future destiny of our country. Therefore, we believe that raising the issue of new morality at this time and place is of great significance. We hope that everyone will work together to form a trend. The establishment of the new morality is certainly a "century-long plan" that cannot be achieved overnight. However, we in the press dare not belittle ourselves, and the entire country should seem to catch up as soon as possible. Otherwise, whether there will still be a place for our old Chinese nation in the future world is really a big question!</p>

<h3>Battle Line at Dongting Lake: Japanese Army Prepares for Large-Scale Offensive, Army and Air Force Cooperate Skillfully, Conducting Encirclement and Suppression Operations Around Nanxian</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 10th, a certain elite unit of the Japanese army, which was conducting a secret operation, echoed the Japanese army's southbound units pursuing the Chongqing army along the north bank of Dongting Lake. With a number of boats, they launched a sudden attack, circling around the central peninsula of Dongting Lake. On the morning of the 9th, they successfully carried out a surprise landing at Kenjiawan and other places 24 kilometers south of Anxiang. Other units broke through the positions of the 589th Regiment of the 179th Division of the Chongqing army guarding Xiaowenzhen, and further shifted their sharp edge through Mucah Lake, Penghu Lake, Dongjiang Lake, and West Dongting Lake. On the morning of the 9th, they advanced to Tianxin Lake and launched a courageous landing operation in the Ouchi Canal tributary area on the opposite bank of Nanzui. At noon on the 9th, the advance ground offensive units advancing south from Anxiang completely cut off the retreat of the Chongqing 161st and 77th Divisions, which were in a state of panic in the area, and launched a fierce attack on them. Furthermore, the Japanese surprise attack units advanced from Tianxin Lake towards Sanxing Lake at the mouth of the Jiudu River and carried out a landing offensive on the afternoon of the 9th. The collapse of the Chongqing army at that location is said to be imminent.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line, with the skillful cooperation of the Japanese army's land and air forces, the retreat of the Chongqing 161st and 77th Divisions was completely cut off, and a fierce attack was launched on them. Furthermore, the Japanese surprise attack units advanced from Tianxin Lake towards Sanxing Lake at the mouth of the Jiudu River and carried out a landing on the afternoon of the 9th, contacting a certain unit that advanced south from Nanxian along the Jiudu River, flanking the main force of the Chongqing Provisional 5th Division near Sanxing Lake. The Chongqing army was panicked by the sudden appearance of the Japanese surprise attack units in the west of Dongting Lake. The collapse of the Chongqing 29th Army Group is said to be imminent.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 10th, with the skillful cooperation of the Japanese army's land and air forces on the Hunan front line, the main force of the Chongqing 29th Army Group is now on the verge of collapse. On the 9th, a large formation of Japanese army aviation units braved torrential rain and took off from a certain base, fiercely strafing the Chongqing army group attempting to break through, inflicting heavy damage on it. It was also detected from the air that the Chongqing army's attempt to escape by water had been completely crushed due to the Japanese aircraft's fierce bombing of Chongqing army boats on the 7th and 8th. The detailed results of the Japanese aircraft's fierce bombing of Chongqing army boats on the 7th and 8th are as follows: three large Chongqing ships were hit and burned, more than 70 boats were sunk, and about 70 were heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the southern front line of the Taihang Mountains on the 10th, the Japanese army units, in sweeping away the remnants of the (24th Army Group), had previously fiercely pursued the remnants of Yu Longwu's unit (40th Army) in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province. However, according to the confessions of prisoners, it was learned that the army commander was bombed to death near Nanling Village, 2 kilometers northeast of Lingchuan, on the border of the province, on April 30th. Furthermore, according to a thorough investigation by the Japanese army, it was also proven that the army commander was indeed bombed to death.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 10th, after launching a fierce attack on the main force of the Chongqing "161st Division," the elite units of the Japanese army are now compressing and encircling the southern area of Nanxian. Because Nanxian was in imminent danger, the main force of the Chongqing "161st Division," numbering about 3,000, began to flee south along the Jiudu River on the morning of the 8th. However, because their hiding place had been lost, they held on to Hehua City, 10 kilometers southwest of Nanxian, for a last-ditch resistance. However, because the Chongqing army could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, they disregarded international law and used poison gas from the night of the 8th to the morning of the 10th in a final struggle. However, because the Japanese army was equipped with scientific equipment, the Chongqing army was ultimately annihilated.</p>
<p>Hunan Front Line, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army units, centered on Xiaojiawan and Sanxian Lake, formed an encirclement circle with a diameter of only 10 kilometers, trapping the Chongqing army inside. They are now gradually shrinking the encirclement circle and conducting encirclement and suppression operations everywhere. The Japanese army advancing from a certain direction, after breaking through the stubborn Chongqing army near Hehua City, then defeated 800 Chongqing soldiers guarding Banzui (20 kilometers southwest of Nanxian), and is now fiercely pursuing about 3,000 Chongqing army remnants in the Sanxian Lake area. Furthermore, the Japanese army pursuing from Baibukou, together with the waterborne mobile units navigating the Changhe River, surrounded and attacked a Chongqing remnant army regiment of about 1,200 people near Yong'anjing (22 kilometers southeast of Baibukou) at dawn on the 9th, inflicting heavy damage on them. Furthermore, a unit of the Japanese army's waterborne suicide attack units that had advanced to the vicinity of Jiangjiazhou also launched a surprise attack on a Chongqing army battalion gathered south of Tingjiazhou and is currently fiercely attacking them.</p>
<p>Hunan Front Line, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army is continuing to sweep away the remnants of the Chongqing 29th Army Group near Meitian Lake (15 kilometers north of Nanxian). On the evening of the 8th, they again attacked about 3,000 Chongqing soldiers attempting to escape from the Wangjia Pharmacy (15 kilometers northwest of Nanxian), inflicting heavy damage on them.</p>
<p>Hunan Front Line, 10th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army suddenly launched a fierce attack on a certain side of Nanxian. The Chongqing army at that location was caught off guard, and the Japanese army advanced rapidly to the south. Furthermore, the Japanese boat mobile units advancing south along the Dou Canal also echoed this, attacking step by step, and finally captured the county seat at 4 pm that afternoon.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the front line in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces on the 10th, after the Japanese army began operations simultaneously on the 6th, the eastward advancing units</p>
<p>Everywhere defeated the resistance of the Japanese army, with the force of a bamboo splitting, and on the morning of the 9th, they joined forces with the westward advancing units, and jointly connected Xiangtangpu, Shimen (10 kilometers west of Shexian), Hushan (10 kilometers northeast of Shexian), Jingdian (6 kilometers east of Shexian), and Cicun (5 kilometers south of Shexian) and other areas into an encirclement net of 10 kilometers east-west and 15 kilometers north-south, encircling the Communist army in the area. The Japanese army units launched a quasi-attack from the Xiangtangpu side. The national army [missing text] Shanxi suppression Japanese army [missing text] attacked from the Fang Sanjie area north of Xiangtangpu. Another part of the Japanese army attacked from the Shimen side, and the westward advancing Japanese army attacked from the Jing [missing text] Hushan side. The Communist army in this encirclement circle [missing text] completely became rats in a sack, and their elimination is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Jinan, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army previously fiercely attacked the Chongqing and Communist armies on both sides of the Yellow River in the northern parts of Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui provinces, inflicting heavy damage on them. The comprehensive war results of the Japanese army in April are recorded as follows: number of engagements 520, of which 182 were with the Communist army. Chongqing and Communist army strength 135,251, of which 24,489 were Communist army.

Chongqing and Communist army corpses left behind totaled 6,473, of which 3,160 were Communist army. 7,315 rifles were seized, of which 631 belonged to the Communist army. 463 pistols, of which 78 belonged to the Communist army. 109 light machine guns, of which 3 were [missing text]. 2 heavy machine guns, 29 automatic rifles, of which 1 belonged to the Communist army. 3 mortars, 13 light mortars, 134 earthen cannons, of which 30 belonged to the Communist army. 1,684 hand grenades, of which 1,246 belonged to the Communist army, and countless other munitions. Taiyuan, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army launched the second phase of this year's Taihang Mountains spring operation, it has occupied all the important strongholds in the Chongqing and Communist military regions of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan. This operation has not only crushed the operational command system of the Chongqing and Communist armies but has also destroyed the military facilities of the Chongqing and Communist armies. The Chongqing army previously established various factories on both sides of the Qingzhang River, boasting that it was a self-sufficient land for resisting Japan. Now the Chongqing and Communist army in that area has been defeated and collapsed, and it is impossible to rebuild them. The main factories and military facilities destroyed by the Japanese army in this campaign include 5 ordnance factories, 3 weapons repair factories, 2 armories, 4 ammunition factories, 5 hand grenade factories, 4 grain factories, 2 iron factories, 2 pharmaceutical factories, 3 textile factories, 2 silk factories, and 4 clothing factories.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain place in the southern Taihang Mountains on the 10th, the Japanese army here announced at 11 am today that the Japanese army units, in order to annihilate the Liu Bocheng army group of the Chongqing army in the Jin-Ji-Yu border region entrenched in the Shexian area (about 100 kilometers north of Linqi), have started a new encirclement operation since the 5th. According to the planned, they advanced rapidly, and by dawn on the 9th, they had broken into the area near Shexian and occupied the various key points of the Chongqing army in that area. Subsequently, they launched sweeping operations separately. In addition, the operation against the Dayue Column of the Communist army near Lusi on the Qin River (about 80 kilometers west of Lu'an), which began on the 30th of last month, has been completed by the 9th of this month. Furthermore, the sweeping operation against the remnants of the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing army is still continuing. The remnants of the Chongqing army are exhausted, and the number of those being annihilated and surrendering is increasing daily.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Achieves Great Results in Assisting the Chiangbei Clearing and Suppression Work</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - The Japanese army units in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River previously assisted the National Government in expanding the clearing and suppression work. Since the beginning of April, the National Government has further promoted the first phase of the clearing and suppression work in the Jiangbei Triangle area. The Japanese army also immediately swept away the remnants of the Chongqing army and fiercely attacked the Chongqing army attempting to make trouble, achieving great results. The number of Chongqing army soldiers captured and surrendered is increasing daily. In total, the Japanese army engaged the Chongqing army in 250 battles in April, the Chongqing army's strength was 46,000, 3,637 corpses were left behind, and 3,660 were captured and surrendered. The Japanese army seized 25 mortars, 1,958 rifles, and countless pistols, earthen cannons, etc. The recent situation of the war in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is recorded as follows: (1) On April 1, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the Taixian, Xinghua, and Dongtai areas of Jiangbei in three directions, southeast, west, inflicting heavy damage on the Li Mingyang army of the Chongqing army and the remnants of the New Fourth Army. As of the 21st, it was determined that 1,050 Chongqing army corpses were left behind, 1,780 were captured, and the Japanese army seized 16 heavy and light machine guns, 125 mortars, and countless rifles and other munitions. (2) The Japanese army detected that the main force of the 92nd Army of the Chongqing side was entrenched on the Longhai Railway, west of Xuzhou and south of Dangshan, attempting to cut off the Longhai Railway. It took preemptive action and launched a surprise attack on the main force of the Chongqing army gathered north of Yongcheng on April 24. After several days of fierce attacks, it killed 1,151 Chongqing army soldiers and seized a large number of munitions. (3) The New Fourth Army north of Hongze Lake had previously suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Hongze. Later, 1,500 remnants of the 2nd Division of the New Fourth Army sneaked into the area, attempting to make trouble. The Japanese army then started operations again on April 15, surrounded them south of Muyang, and inflicted heavy damage on them. They are currently continuing to sweep them away.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Western Hebei is Expanding the Results of the War</h3>
<p>Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched the annihilation operation against the "Third Military Subdistrict" in the Western Hebei Military Region, it has been ten days, and the enemy army in the area has been trapped in military encirclement. Furthermore, since the 8th, they have tightened the encirclement net and swept away small groups of Communist army everywhere, advancing towards the central part. The collapse of the enemy's "Third Military Subdistrict" is imminent. The comprehensive results achieved by the Japanese army on the 8th are as follows: 266 enemy corpses were left behind, 113 were captured, and the Japanese army intercepted 120 rifles, 1 mortar, 32 hand grenades, 3 grenade launchers, 83 bayonets, 83 earthen cannons, 27 pistols, and a large amount of other grain and ammunition, destroying 9 enemy barracks, 1 clothing warehouse, 21 grain warehouses, and 1 landmine factory. Furthermore, the annihilation operation launched by the Japanese army against the enemy headquarters of the Fourth Military Subdistrict in the Western Hebei Military Region since last month and the blitzkrieg launched against the Third Military Subdistrict in the Western Hebei Military Region since the 1st of this province are collectively called the Western Hebei Operation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Near Shexian is Conducting Sweeping Operations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Jin-Ji-Yu border region on the 10th, after the elite units of the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the Communist army in the area near Shexian at dawn on the 9th, they have now secured all the key points along the Qingzhang River. The Japanese army in the area of Suozhuang (the central hub of the Jin-Ji-Yu Red Border Region), has overcome the steep terrain of about 60 kilometers in just four days, and the annihilation operation against the Red Border Region has now entered the final stage. The situation of the war is recorded as follows: (1) A certain unit of the Japanese army, centered on Shexian, joined forces with another unit north of Shexian and conducted a sweeping operation in the area near Suobao Village (8 kilometers north of Shexian) to completely destroy the Communist army's facilities. (2) The Japanese army, which was conducting a sweeping operation in the area near Retu Valley in Matianzhen (8 kilometers west of Matianzhen), destroyed a large-scale ordnance factory of the Communist army in a village southwest of Matianzhen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Chief of Staff Talks About the Course of the Anxiang Operation</h3>
<p>Anxiang, 10th (Central News Agency) - The chief of staff of a certain unit of the Japanese army, in this Hunan operation, captured Anxiang and surrounded tens of thousands of Chongqing army soldiers, establishing unprecedented meritorious service. On the 10th, in Anxiang County, he delivered a speech on the significance of this operation and the course of the battle, saying: the plan for this offensive operation was ingenious and exceeded the expectations of the Chongqing side. The Chongqing army relied on the rivers and lakes, believing that the Japanese army could not attack, but the Japanese army overcame these natural obstacles, using them to cut off the retreat of the Chongqing army. This point is the greatest feature of this operation. We also used this waterway to break through the Chongqing army's strong defensive positions with powerful assault units, and equipped powerful units on both sides, at the time of the attack, impacting the flanks of the Chongqing army, making it unable to fight back. Because the Japanese army's attack was rapid, the Chongqing army was in a state of panic. Cadres and other escorts [missing text] units took boats and fled. The retreat covering units had their morale demoralized. Since the beginning of the army's actions, in just three days, it broke into the territory of Anxiang County, and the Chongqing army abandoned 1,500 corpses, giving the Chongqing army a crushing defeat in a short period of time [missing text]. The Chongqing "Sixth War Zone" army, which was responding to the war, was regarded by the Chongqing side as its only elite army. Now that it has been hit, the impact on the Chongqing regime's future resistance is said to be great.</p>
<h3>Military Inspection Group Leader Ye Peng Broadcasts to Compatriots in the Motherland from Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - General Ye Peng, head of the Chinese Military Inspection Group, delivered a broadcast report to compatriots in the motherland titled "Japan's Chances of Victory." He pointed out that based on the conclusions drawn from this military inspection in Japan, he firmly believed that Japan would be victorious. This speech was broadcast by this radio station via recording on the evening of the 8th, and will be rebroadcast by the Nanjing Central Radio Station in two or three days. The gist of the speech is recorded as follows: "Brothers and colleagues of the Military Inspection Group were ordered by the Chairman to visit Japan. Although we saw many places in a short period of ten days or so, it was only a glimpse of Japan. Even with what we observed, we may not have grasped the essentials or been entirely accurate. I truly feel ashamed to report to the people of the country about Japan's state of readiness for decisive battle in this way. Today, what I am broadcasting to the people of the country is only the situation regarding Japan's chances of victory. I will use a general method to simply separate my impressions and observations for discussion: (A) Japan's basic conditions. In my opinion, Japan first has its basic conditions, and then generates its conditions for decisive victory. Therefore, I must first list Japan's basic conditions, which are (1) the unity of spiritual civilization and material civilization. Among the countries of the modern world, countries that lean towards spiritual civilization are not adapted to the modern environment and will inevitably lag behind, as is the case with our China. Countries that lean towards material civilization are numbed by utilitarianism and will inevitably fall into fantasy, as is the case with countries like Britain and the United States. I now observe that Japan is the only country in the world that can unite spiritual civilization and material civilization, maintaining the spiritual civilization of the East while catching up with the material civilization of the West, integrating and understanding them thoroughly. This is also the spirit of the Doctrine of the Mean. (2) The spirit of 'Ichi-sho Kenmei' (一生懸命). The spirit of 'Ichi-sho Kenmei' translates into Chinese as the spirit of desperate effort. The Japanese are not more intelligent than people of other countries, nor are they stronger, but they all practice 'Ichi-sho Kenmei.' With 'Ichi-sho Kenmei' alone, nothing is impossible and no enemy cannot be overcome. Just look at their desperate research on modern machinery, and they finally achieved improvements that other countries cannot match. This is the achievement of the Japanese people's 'Ichi-sho Kenmei.' (3) 'Zuibun Hokoku' (隨分報國). The Japanese people are either serving the country at the front or serving the country at the rear. This includes what is called 'labor service to the country,' 'production service to the country,' and even 'cultural service to the country,' 'childbearing service to the country,' etc. Regardless of gender, age, occupation, or whether they are soldiers, merchants, workers, or farmers, all take serving the country as their thought and deed. Every citizen and every activity is in the high tide of serving the country. This is genuine 'Zuibun Hokoku' and is a unified 'Zuibun Hokoku.' In terms of manpower, it would be a great mistake to only consider quantity. In my opinion, the above three conditions are the elements and driving forces of the Japanese spirit and national power, and therefore, they are called Japan's basic conditions. (B) Japan's conditions for decisive victory. The so-called conditions for decisive victory are the necessary conditions for modern warring countries. Japan has the following conditions for those necessary conditions: (1) 'A country with forests of chimneys.' In modern times, places with few chimneys are colonies, and places with many chimneys are rich and powerful countries. This is common knowledge. As soon as we entered Japanese territory, we saw forests of chimneys and coal smoke covering the sky, especially when passing through the Osaka-Kobe area, where they are everywhere. It is said that Osaka City alone has 30,000 named chimneys, and countless unnamed chimneys. The chimneys throughout Japan are a measure of Japan's wealth and power. (2) 'Highly armed through advanced industry.' The construction of modern land, sea, and air forces is not in barracks, ships, and airfields, but in military factories. Japan has long been highly industrialized, and in wartime, factories can switch their production capacity to military supplies. No matter what enemy propaganda says, it is really not inferior to Britain or the United States. Therefore, Japan's land, sea, and air force equipment is complete, which goes without saying, and the entire country has formed a complete high degree of armament in all national defense facilities or defense systems. (3) (Self-sufficiency in military resources). The importance of modern military resources goes without saying. Japan already has a large amount of preparations and reserves, and Japan also has rich occupied lands, such as the South Seas. Although wartime transportation is inevitably difficult in any country, Japanese factories, with their large-scale production, show no signs of a shortage of raw materials. (4) 'No lack of living materials and assets.' Japan, which strives for production on one hand and vigorously practices economy on the other, has achieved amazing results. In terms of the exchange of materials, there is not only domestic production, but also many sources. Even if there is some waste, there is no shortage. However, Japan vigorously practices economy, and its control and distribution are extremely effective, and the uniform and arduous distribution is especially commendable. In this way, there will never be a shortage of living materials. (5) 'Stability of finance and currency.' The situation regarding the Japanese people's savings, government budgets, and digestion of public bonds shows that Japan's finances are very stable even in the high tide of war, and there are no signs of inflation or currency devaluation. In short, Japan under the state of decisive battle has transformed its entire country into a whole, great, strong barracks. Everyone, everything, and every matter is organized under the military and has truly achieved the extreme of mass warfare and total warfare. With these conditions for inevitable victory, the Japanese people have formed a belief in inevitable victory. I believe that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is really not a problem. Our compatriots, under the leadership of the Chairman, are participating in the war in cooperation with the allied countries to sympathize with the Greater East Asian war of national liberation, to solve the problem of our semi-colonial status, and to follow the legacy of Pan-Asianism. Although success or failure is a small matter, hearing about Japan's chances of victory, as reported by me, will naturally bring the joy of a shared victory among allies and encourage greater cooperation. Compatriots, we must not only pledge to cooperate even more for the Greater East Asia total war, but also learn from Japan and share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia together."</p>
<h3>Economic Advisor Ishiwata Inspects Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Sotaro Ishiwata, economic advisor to the National Government, arrived in Suzhou by express train from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th to understand the general economic situation in the "pacified areas" and to collect information on the economic facilities of Jiangsu Province for research purposes. The heads of various departments of the provincial government went to the station to greet him. Mr. Ishiwata first visited the highest unit of the allied forces stationed in Suzhou, and then visited Governor Li at noon at 12:00. Governor Li personally received him and they had a long conversation. Governor Li also hosted a banquet. In the afternoon, Mr. Ishiwata visited scenic spots in Suzhou such as Lingyan Mountain and the Lion Grove, and returned to Nanjing by train at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Prohibits Trading in Enemy Currency - Including Coal Mine Sterling and Hong Kong Dollars</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - It has been reliably learned from the Ministry of Finance that the buying, selling, trading, or remittance of enemy currencies such as US dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars has long been strictly prohibited by the allied authorities. It is now found that there are still transactions involving the buying and selling of the above-mentioned enemy currencies on the market in various places, which is completely wrong. The Ministry of Finance issued a public notice on May 10th stating that from today onwards, all buying, selling, trading, or remittance of US dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, and promissory notes and checks denominated in these currencies should be strictly prohibited. If there is any possession or holding of the above-mentioned currencies, it should also be strictly investigated and dealt with. Anyone who deliberately violates this rule will be punished severely once verified. It is also heard that the areas of implementation are Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Wuhan, and various regions in North and South China, and notifications have been sent to the provincial and municipal governments to investigate and ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Statement Issued by the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - In response to the National Government's Ministry of Finance's announcement on the 10th of the immediate implementation of measures to ban enemy currencies, the Japanese Embassy in China issued a statement on the same day, stating in essence that the buying and selling of US dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, and checks, including small checks, denominated in these currencies, as well as all other transactions, carrying, transporting, and remittance activities, had already been prohibited by a public notice issued by the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on July 14th of last year. Now, the National Government has again issued a public notice today by the Ministry of Finance, prohibiting not only the transaction but also the possession of these currencies. Anyone who dares to violate this rule will be severely punished. The National Government has previously completed the work of currency unification in the peaceful areas, and the adoption of this measure now is an effective and appropriate response to the implementation of the militarized yen unification work in Hong Kong by the Japanese side from today onwards. It aims to eradicate the black market trading of these enemy currencies, to assist in the work of overthrowing British and American forces in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This fully demonstrates and expresses China's determination to participate in the Greater East Asia War, and the Japanese side is deeply grateful for this.</p>
<h3>Change of Head of the North China Education Department</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - By order of the National Government (May 10th), Wen Yuanmo, Director of the Education Department of the North China Political Affairs Commission, requested to resign from his position.

<h3>Governor of Jiangxi Province Dispatches Personnel to Prepare</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since receiving his appointment, Deng Zuyu, the newly appointed Governor of Jiangxi Province, has been extremely busy preparing for the establishment of provincial government affairs. He has decided to send Yang Zhiqing, the Director of the Provincial Government Affairs Department, to Jiangxi Province first to carry out preparatory liaison matters. He will go to Jiangxi to assume his new post as soon as the location of the provincial government is determined. Furthermore, the position of Principal of the Central Police Academy will still be held concurrently by Mr. Deng.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masami, Departs for China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Tani Masami, the new Japanese Ambassador to China, after receiving his orders, consulted with the Greater East Asia Ministry and other parties on all matters. In view of the need to actively promote Japan's policy towards China, he departed from Tokyo at 9:00 AM today, accompanied by Counselor Ota of the Japanese Embassy in China. According to the new Japanese policy towards China, taking China's participation in the war as an opportunity, Japan will vigorously assist the National Government to strengthen its political power. China's autonomy and independence are being gradually realized with Japan's active cooperation. Since China shares life and death with Japan and comprehensively cooperates to complete the task of the Greater East Asia War, the future policies must be vigorously promoted. After Ambassador Tani takes office this time, Japan's policy towards China will become more concrete, and the relationship between China and Japan will inevitably be further strengthened. Ambassador Tani is scheduled to visit the Ise Grand Shrine on the way, and is expected to arrive in Nanjing, the capital of our country, around the middle of the month.</p>
<h3>Major Victory on the India-Burma Border - Japanese Army Occupies Buthidaung</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on May 10th: Japanese army units infiltrated Buthidaung on the upper reaches of the Mayu River at 7:00 PM on May 8th. After fierce fighting, they occupied it and are now mopping up the remaining enemy forces.</p>
<p>Southernmost Front on the India-Burma Border, 10th - In order to defeat the British Indian Army's activities on the India-Burma border, the Japanese army launched an offensive on the banks of the Mayu River, maintaining the initiative of the battle with skillful jungle warfare. After a fierce attack through thorny and rugged roads, they broke into Buthidaung, the last stronghold of the enemy army, at 7:00 PM on the 10th and occupied it, approaching 20 kilometers into the India-Burma border. After the Japanese army eliminated the enemy's stubborn resistance with a heroic night attack on May 4th, they captured a key point 5 kilometers west of Buthidaung. In this battle, the enemy army left behind 150 corpses, abandoned 30 cars, 300 horses, and other military equipment and ammunition, and retreated towards Buthidaung. As a result, the enemy army's supply line connecting Kyauktaw and Buthidaung was cut off, and Buthidaung was isolated. Because the enemy army's retreat route to Maungdaw was cut off, they fled in panic to Buthidaung, using it as a base to gather their forces and attempt a final resistance. The Japanese army bravely pursued and continued their fierce advance. Another Japanese unit bypassed the upper reaches of the Mayu River on May 6th and attacked 10 kilometers east of Buthidaung. In this way, the two routes echoed each other, and finally broke into Buthidaung. The enemy army had previously used Buthidaung as a long-term base for attacking Burma, so they defended it with all their might. At that time, the sound of artillery fire from both sides rumbled, shaking the banks of the Mayu River. The streets of Buthidaung were struck by fierce Japanese artillery fire, and the flames soared into the sky, creating a tragic scene.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese army, which had previously thwarted the British Indian Army's attempt to recapture Kyauktaw by defeating their main force in the Indian area of the India-Burma border, is now continuing to fight in the hot mountains and plains, fiercely attacking the enemy's stronghold of Buton on the left bank of the Machu River on the India-Burma border. After fierce fighting, they completely occupied it. This was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 10th. Buthidaung, occupied by the Japanese army this time, is located about 40 kilometers north of India on the India-Burma border and is a key British military site. Since the British army attempted to recapture Burma and attacked Kyauktaw last year, it has become an important logistics base for them. After the British Indian Army failed in the battle on the Kyauktaw front, they consolidated their positions in Buthidaung and gathered considerable forces in the vicinity, including several divisions of fresh troops and other remnants, attempting to counterattack the Japanese army. The Japanese army launched a siege centered on Buthidaung, starting from both banks of the Machu River, and crushed the new attempt of the British army. The British Indian Army's dream of recapturing Burma and attempting to start a commotion was completely shattered by this Japanese attack.</p>

This move by the enemy submarine is clearly an attempt to carry out psychological warfare. If we are surprised by this, we will be taken advantage of by the enemy. Judging from the current situation, similar events may occur in the future. We should adhere to the belief in inevitable victory and wish all our people to work hard in their respective positions.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces Move Towards Cape Bon - Fierce Rearguard Action in Progress - Small Boats Secretly Cross the Strait of Sicily at Night - All Large Military Installations Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Bern, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to today's news: The Axis forces are now maintaining a triangular front line to cope with the attacks of the anti-Axis forces. Most of the German and other troops in Tunisia are gradually withdrawing towards Cape Bon at the tip of Tunisia. According to estimates from anti-Axis aerial reconnaissance, there are about 50,000 Axis troops moving towards Cape Bon, who are now retreating into the isthmus there. Because the rearguard action is extremely fierce, its entrance and exit have not been blocked. According to a Reuters report: The British 6th Armored Division is now advancing towards Suleiman inside the entrance to Cape Bon and has crossed Menmon Libre. Another British armored division and French armored units are also advancing towards this area in an encirclement formation. At the same time, the anti-Axis naval and air forces are active at sea, hoping to intercept Axis ships within the Strait of Sicily. However, the Axis forces have the advantage of favorable weather conditions and are secretly crossing the strait by small boats under the cover of darkness. Anti-Axis sources also said that German and Italian aircraft, destroyers, torpedo boats, and ferries regularly travel back and forth between Tunisia and Sicily. According to news from the British side: There was still fighting in the Bizerte area on Saturday morning. After fighting bravely, the German army began to withdraw to the mountains west of the city. Several thousand main force troops are now moving along the bay and coastal highway towards Boro Farina. American forces are finding it difficult to clear out the German assault troops in the city of Bizerte. Reuters correspondent Blanc said that the German army would make a strong defensive battle, and the German assault teams in the city streets were very active, while the German artillery on the small mountains across the strait also opened fire and bombarded. German tank units are now stationed at a more southern location to prevent American tank columns from moving around the east bank of Bizerte. In addition, the German side has moved 2,500 troops into Porto Farina. The power plant on the west bank of Lake Bizerte was destroyed on Saturday afternoon. The electricity for the city of Bizerte and its suburbs was supplied by this plant. Many other military installations in Bizerte were also destroyed by the German army before the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported that the Fuehrer's headquarters issued a war report stating: (1) South of Bizerte, the enemy army used new and larger tank columns and powerful air forces to attack the Axis forces.

<h3>Fresh German Troops Reinforce the Eastern Front - The Front Line Extends 2,000 Miles - The Possibility of a Major War Breaking Out at Any Time - Soviet Offensive in the Kupiansk Area Repelled</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German army is gathering a large number of new forces at many strongholds along the 2,000-mile front line from the Arctic to the Black Sea, so the Soviet side may launch a major war at any time.

<h3>Current Situation in Wartime China – Symposium – Translated from "Reconstruction" May Issue (1)</h3>
<p>Date: April 9, Year 32 (1943)</p>
<p>Location: Imperial Hotel, Tokyo</p>
<p>Attendees: Chen Gongbo, Okawa Shumei, Tachibana Shiraki, Matsumoto Shigeharu, Yamamoto Jitsuhiko</p>
<p>Yamamoto: Next, regarding various specialized matters, I believe Mr. Okawa, Mr. Tachibana, and Mr. Matsumoto all have various opinions to express. However, I would like to ask one more question, and that is the future of the current reserve certificates or currency, and the issue of military construction. How will these types of issues be handled? Mr. Chen is a proponent of controlled economy in China, so he must have insightful views on how to implement various new organizations in the peaceful areas regarding economic and financial matters. Now, please Mr. Chen, share your thoughts.</p>
<p>Chen: Then I will answer that. First, let's talk about the issue of reserve certificates. In my opinion, it is best to have only one type of currency in circulation. I believe it is not feasible to have various currencies coexisting. As you all know, the resources of North China do not flow to Central China, and similarly, the resources of Central China do not flow to North China. The economic conditions are independent of each other. Because resources do not flow, for example, the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, hoping to obtain resources from North China, after various negotiations, finally manage to transport some of the desired resources over. Then they must remit money. However, when remitting money, because there is more than one type of currency, there are fluctuations in exchange rates and other difficulties. As a result, the economies of North and Central China are isolated. I believe this is also an issue that the authorities of both countries should work together to study and resolve in the future.</p>
<p>Now, this ideal is gradually being realized. For example, the issuance of military currency has been stopped. However, this issue is naturally being studied by the financial authorities of both countries. I am not a financial authority, so I can only answer a few thoughts on the question just raised.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the issue of military construction. In my opinion, spiritual education is the most important thing, and it is the foundation of military construction; the second is the issue of weapons. The Central Military Academy has now been established in Nanjing, and the first class of graduates will be produced this September. People from both China and Japan are very satisfied with the performance of that class of graduates. Chairman Wang personally gives instructions once a week, and every student can often hear the Chairman's instructions. Therefore, they understand their responsibilities. Why be a soldier? What should a soldier do? – They are very clear about this responsibility and purpose. They also thoroughly understand national policy. Like this, the foundation of military construction is being consolidated day by day.</p>
<p>However, what remains is the issue of weapons. Currently, the reorganization and training of the national army are being carried out temporarily in various places. However, the temporarily assembled troops can only be responsible for maintaining public order at present. Then what is the best way? I believe that a large number of graduates from schools should still be added to various armies, and then, with the assistance of your country, seek to enrich the weapons. If this can be done, then it will certainly enable the national army to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. This point relies heavily on your country's understanding and assistance. Not to mention those in power in your country, but also those of you who are out of office, if you also advocate the idea that the National Government's military construction is intended to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and that it is now fully engaged in spiritual training, striving to consolidate its goals, and therefore should be assisted with weapons – then the National Government's military construction issue will have great hope for the future.</p>
<p>Next is the issue of economic control. Many people believe that the principle of economic control is to buy and distribute: I believe that it is to implement planned production, buy up the produced materials, and then distribute the bought-up materials reasonably. As long as it can be done smoothly, the goal of economic control can be achieved. If we examine the controlled economy of the past, we know that it does not conform to the purpose of production, but is some non-productive economic control. Also, regarding buying, it is also unplanned buying. If you want to ask: Since the new policy of material control was improved last month, has China been engaged in planned production? – Then I will answer: It has not yet entered that period; but it can be said that it has entered a promising stage.</p>
<p>The purpose of the production policy is to benefit the Greater East Asia War; this is the greatest purpose of production. In the past, it was just because the local area was stable and the war had stopped, so they just tried to do it. In fact, production that benefits the Greater East Asia War as its greatest purpose has not yet been done. However, it can now be said that it has entered such a period of brewing. Also, the so-called lack of planning in the buying method is that partial control has been implemented until today, so the materials in Shanghai cannot be transported to Suzhou, and the materials in Suzhou cannot be transported to Wuxi, and they are in a state of small blood circulation with each other. Then, after the implementation of this new policy, has planned buying been carried out? – Speaking of this, I can answer: It has definitely not been carried out to that point. However, it will naturally reach this point after the new policy is improved. Everyone says that although the plan has not been established, if the new policy is implemented, materials will naturally be bought. I believe that this kind of natural buying is unreliable. In any case, the state must establish a certain plan, make an overall plan for the materials necessary for the war, and then ensure that the state can use the materials necessary for the war at any time. Also, materials that are not necessary for the Greater East Asia War should be circulated among the people in order to stabilize the people's lives – I believe that this kind of planned buying should be implemented.</p>
<p>Next is planned distribution. Examining the current state of rationing, only rice rationing is being carried out in China, and even the method of distribution has not been put on track. However, that is not without reason. Because it has only been twenty days since the implementation of the new policy on material control, one cannot demand that it be realized rapidly. Therefore, the true function of economic control has to await the next stage.</p>
<p>Yamamoto: Mr. Tachibana, you are very busy, please raise your questions first.</p>
<p>Tachibana: (To Mr. Okawa) Mr. Okawa, do you have any questions?</p>
<p>Okawa: No, I don't.</p>
<p>Tachibana: Then I would like to raise the issue of economic control. I believe that there are very important elements in the government's implementation of economic control. Therefore, when the National Government implements economic control, no matter how perfect the government's plan is, if there are no corresponding economic facilities or economic institutions below, then the agency is equivalent to being nominally there but not functional. That kind of force that acts in accordance with the government's wishes below, in China, I believe should be sought in the elders groups in the local society, and the national capitalists in Shanghai who are based on those elders groups. The reconstruction of China is not just about permeating economic control into the people, but the entire work is also non-existent without being based on China's local society. Not to mention the Yan'an regime, even the Chongqing regime, I believe, has not been able to devote its efforts to this point. Those who have this qualification are the Kuomintang, which is guided by Mr. Jingwei, and the National Government under its guidance. In a word, it is the National Regime. There is no other. I think we should contribute our help as much as possible in the capacity of those out of office. Regarding this point, Mr. Chen's opinion, in expecting the penetration of the controlled economic policy, what kind of brilliant insights does he have regarding the elders groups and national capital that constitute the local society? I would like to ask Mr. Chen about this.</p>
<p>Chen: Regarding this issue, we have repeatedly discussed and considered it in detail. To give a concrete example, the agency for implementing the new policy of material control – the National General Association for Commercial Control – has already been organized. This agency is by no means an agency of officials of the National Government, but is entirely an organization of civilian economic groups. The government has nothing to do with it; the government only gives guidance and direction. The central figures in organizing this National General Association for Commercial Control are the trade associations in Shanghai or other trade associations in various places. Moreover, there are also Japanese organizations joining this Commercial Control Association, that is, Japanese organizations have also become a cell of the National General Association for Commercial Control. Therefore, the organization of this agency is very appropriate. And according to the purpose of the National General Association for Commercial Control, it can implement the items regarding material control. Because if the people do not understand the meaning of material control, then even if many organizations for material control are created, the people will still not follow. That is certainly not okay, so the people must first understand its meaning, but before making them understand, it is better to let them implement it first, and let them do this matter themselves, which is the fastest way to get results.</p>
<p>Tachibana: Substantive...</p>
<p>Chen: Therefore, the above-mentioned civilian organization was created to let the people implement it themselves. Therefore, that agency is definitely not being implemented solely by the government, but the government is only standing in a guiding position, and it is the people who are automatically implementing it.</p>
<p>Tachibana: That's great. So, as I said just now, whether it is the Kuomintang or the National Government, it is precisely relying on the substantive, autonomous, and enthusiastic efforts of the people to build a new China, and then to move towards the construction of Greater East Asia. However, before that, the opponent of the great cause of the National Regime, I believe, is actually the local society, which is the foundation of the elders groups and national capitalists mentioned just now, and is also their territory. In this way, then the so-called local society is actually the life of China's reconstruction, and is the source of political power. How did Sun Yat-sen grasp this important foundation? – Turning over Mr. Sun's surviving documents, we can see that the so-called Chinese society is actually based on the family as a very important foundation. Families gather to form clans, and clans gather to form a nation. Therefore, if we want to unite the Chinese people, who are like a sheet of loose sand, into a strong nation or state, we must consolidate the clan that serves as the medium between the family and the nation. In this way, it occupies five or six pages, and discusses the issue of the rational organization of the clan from various points of view. Therefore, I believe that what Mr. Sun grasped was this meaning. Is Mr. Chen's hometown also Guangdong?</p>
<p>Chen: Yes.</p>
<p>Tachibana: Mr. Sun is also from Guangdong. In the area of Guangdong and Fujian, the so-called clan over there has a very large influence; however, as it gradually reached the north, the so-called clan's influence also followed, whether political or economic, and declined. Therefore, in terms of Guangdong and Fujian, it is completely the same as what Mr. Sun said, but further north, it is not the clan that becomes a blood-related society, but the local society that includes the society of variegated colors with a broader meaning. There is a Chinese saying, "xiangdang," which in our Japanese terms, is the local society. Therefore, the clan that Mr. Sun said, if used in a broader sense, I think it is better to use the term "xiangdang" or local society to call it, which is easier to understand. In this way, then Mr. Sun's nationalism, the result of which is strong – not loose sand-like – a nation and a national society, is it not formed by the local society?</p>
<p>Chen: To talk about the Three Principles of the People, it is a long story that cannot be finished in a short time. Now, let me talk about a part of it that is related to the points of your inquiry. Chinese society is based on agricultural society, and it can also be said to be mainly based on agricultural society. Needless to say, the family is the most important in agricultural society. The family is really the most valued. People who are related to the family are regarded as family members. People who live in the same building are of course family members, but many people who are related to it, even if they do not live in their home, are also interpreted as family members. In Chinese agricultural society, valuing the family is very reasonable.</p>
<p>In the north, there are many villages scattered here and there. In the south, there are many villages that become groups. And in the south, there are often thousands or tens of thousands of people living in one village, becoming a group; it is not like this in the north. Because of this reason, Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to find a way to make the Chinese people realize national unity, but he did not have a word that could explain it. Because the Chinese people are mainly based on the family, he started from the family. Then he gradually made the family, the clan, and the nation easy for people to understand. Or, in this family, it may contain the meaning of the so-called local area in the north. To say it in a broader way, it is the clan. In short, starting from the family is because China attaches importance to the family, and wants to form a nation from the family. Therefore, from the family and clan aspects, the concept of the nation is emphasized.</p>
<p>Tachibana: Yes.</p>
<p>Chen: Also, for reference, let me give another example. In the northwest of China, the influence of the Communist Party is now very large. However, when the Communist Party implements its politics, it strives to not implement policies that violate the traditions of Chinese society. It does not do anything that opposes the family. Therefore, it also hangs the banner of nationalism based on the family. So, at the beginning of this war, the Communist Party hung up the banner of "Look, the Japanese came to China to oppose our nationalism, so let's all fight!" and practiced its communist politics. People in the north have the same concept. Especially farmers, and even city dwellers, have such a concept. Therefore, for example, if someone's land is confiscated, even if only one person's land is confiscated, it will have the following impact. That is, not to mention someone's brothers, their ancestors, their fathers, and other relatives, old friends, or cousins, or people with the same surname who branched off from tens of generations ago, these people will all express sympathy for that someone whose land was taken away. For example, if someone's land is taken away by the Communist Party, then many people who are related to that person will oppose the Communist Party. Also, suppose someone's land is taken away by the army, then not to mention the family living in their house, but all those who are related to them will sympathize with that someone. Originally, there was such a state of affairs.</p>
<p>The person who came up with this theory was Sun Yat-sen. He believed that if the principle of the family is grasped first, then the principle of the nation can be emphasized. Therefore, he started from the family and realized the policy that consolidates the origin of a country.</p>
<h3>Important Correction</h3>
<p>From the sixteenth line of the second grid to the eighteenth line of the fourth grid in yesterday's text, that is, "so that China and Japan will encounter...another opportunity," is connected to the third line of the sixth grid, after "…is because Chiang Kai-shek colluded with the United Kingdom and the United States." and before "For example, the establishment of peace between Japan and China…" Because it was arranged upside down by the typesetter, the tone of the sentences was chaotic.

<h3>Various Groups Appeal for Strict Punishment of the Culprits in the Zhang Case; Special Second Court Opens Investigative Hearing This Morning</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The case of French Inspector Millet of the French Concession Police killing young Zhang Jinhai has been formally prosecuted after the French Consulate Court concluded its investigation. Five million citizens throughout the city are now unanimously and closely watching the legal sanctions. Yesterday afternoon, the French Consulate Court held an on-site performance at the French Police Department. The Procuratorate of the Special Second Court is scheduled to open a hearing this morning. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>On-Site Performance</p>
<p>After the French Consulate Court repeatedly opened hearings on the case of Zhang Jinhai being forced to death by torture, it was deemed that the culprit, French Inspector Millet, was guilty. Based on Article 309 of the French Criminal Code, a formal prosecution was filed. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Judge Corbin of the French Consulate Court, accompanied by Secretary Lege, Consul Judicial Police Chief Lebrun, the accused culprit Millet, Chinese detectives Zhu Songcheng and Guo Shiyuan, and another victim, Peng Shuanglong, went to the Criminal Division of the Lujiawan General Police Station on Xuehua Road for an on-site investigation. At the same time, the beating situation was re-enacted, and photos were taken on the spot as evidence. It was not until after 5:00 p.m. that it was completed.</p>
<p>Hearing This Morning</p>
<p>The family members of Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally murdered, submitted a report to the Second Special District Court. The Procuratorate of the court recently issued a summons, scheduling a hearing to begin at 9:00 p.m. tonight (the 11th) in the court of the court. At that time, all the accused will be present in court on time to await questioning. However, the accused and others are still detained in the French Police Station and must be transferred to the court this morning.</p>
<p>French Response to the Peng Case</p>
<p>As for Peng Shuanglong, a seventeen-year-old apprentice who was also beaten and injured, who is being treated at Guangci Hospital, it was suddenly reported yesterday that he refused to meet with his family members, which increased the public's indignation. The French Police Department responded to this matter, saying, "After Peng Shuanglong was released on April 30, he voluntarily went to Guangci Hospital for treatment. If Peng's family members are dissatisfied with the hospital's regulations and food, they can transfer to another hospital on their own, and there is no need for special permission from the Police Department."</p>
<p>Family Members of the Deceased Run Around Appealing</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by lawyer Gao Yunlu, Zhang Jinhai's family members continued to petition various parties, going to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, and news agencies. First, they visited Minister Luo at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Minister sent a representative to meet them. Then they went to the Chamber of Commerce, where Director Yuan Lvden met them. He attached great importance to the case and had the Chamber of Commerce send a telegram to the central government to seriously negotiate, hoping to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderer. They will certainly provide assistance in the future.</p>
<p>Various Groups Petition the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Anti-British and Anti-American Association of the Chinese Nation, the Anti-Communist League of East Asia, the United Chinese Hongmen Society, the Chinese Construction Youth Corps, the International Anti-Communist League, and the Zhenjiang Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai jointly sent representatives to visit Mayor Chen Gongbo at the Municipal Government at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (the 10th). Mayor Chen specially sent Secretary-General Zhao Shibiao to meet them, expressing his attitude towards the Zhang case and expressing his opinions. Finally, the representatives of the various groups successively stated the legal viewpoints of the principal murderer Millet's criminal behavior and requested Secretary-General Zhao to forward the request to Mayor Chen to extradite the criminal Millet to the Chinese court for trial as soon as possible in accordance with diplomatic procedures, and to punish him with the crime he deserved, so as to quell public anger. Secretary-General Zhao immediately expressed his acceptance of the opinions and said that he would forward them to Mayor Chen for consideration and handling. It is also learned that various groups have hired four famous Shanghai lawyers, Jin Xiongbo, Fang Kangnian, Zhou Enzhan, and Tao Aixian, to provide opinions on the Zhang case and provide legal defense.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Zhao Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>When Secretary-General Zhao represented Mayor Chen in meeting with representatives of various people's groups, he expressed his attitude towards the Zhang case, saying, "After this incident occurred, firstly, the public opinion in Shanghai expressed indignation and upheld justice, which has attracted close attention from the citizens and has been quite effective. Secondly, the court has formally filed a public prosecution based on the legal supervisory position, and there will be an appropriate disposition soon. Thirdly, the municipal government has also lodged a serious protest with the French authorities. In the future, we hope that the people's groups, the court, and the municipal government can take consistent steps and jointly plan the progress. It is expected that the resolution of the Zhang case will achieve satisfactory results."</p>
<p>Telegram to Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration</p>
<p>To Luo, Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government, and Chen Junjian, President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, we have learned that in the case of the Shanghai French Concession patrol police torturing Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Socks Factory, to death, the public is indignant and public opinion is in an uproar. Foreigners have historically abused their powers and disregarded human life by relying on extraterritoriality and concession relations, which is a heinous crime. Our association cannot ignore this in order to protect human rights and maintain judicial authority. Moreover, the National Government is now working with friendly neighbor Japan to build a new order in East Asia. Shanghai, in particular, is where all eyes are focused, and we cannot allow such an inhumane and humiliating incident to occur again. Therefore, we hereby telegraphically request your Excellency to seriously negotiate with the Shanghai French Concession authorities as soon as possible, and to ensure that they fulfill the following conditions based on the judicial position: (1) All criminals shall be handed over to the Chinese court for trial, (2) The family members of the deceased and injured shall be compensated, and (3) It shall be guaranteed that the same incident will not occur again in the future, so as to redress the grievances and uphold justice. As for Guo Shiyuan, Zhu Songcheng, and others, who abuse their power and oppress their compatriots, they should be punished with the most severe penalty to serve as a warning to those who rely on foreign forces to oppress their compatriots. The telegram is filled with grief and indignation, and we look forward to your urgent attention. The Shanghai Branch of the China General Association of the East Asia League, the Anti-British and Anti-American Association of China, the Anti-Communist League of East Asia, the United Chinese Hongmen Society, the Chinese Construction Youth Corps, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Zhenjiang Fellow Villagers Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Citizens Telegraph Shanghai for Justice</p>
<p>"Having read the reports in various newspapers revealing that the Shanghai French Police Inspector Millet and others tortured Zhang Jinhai to death and severely injured Peng Shuanglong, who is under the legal age, the behavior is tragic and extremely cruel, making it unbearable to read. The various Zhenjiang groups in Shanghai have unanimously expressed their support and aroused public anger, which shows that the facts are true and not fabricated. At a time when the return of extraterritoriality by friendly nations is being realized, such a tragic case has occurred, which is shocking and contrary to public reason. Moreover, the police station has a history of illegality, and it is difficult to enumerate the oppression suffered by our people. If the chief culprit is not severely punished according to the law, the family members of the deceased are not compensated, and the police station is not held responsible for guaranteeing that the same incident will not occur again, then what is humanity, and how can we warn others? We hereby telegraphically request that you respectfully report to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to seriously negotiate and achieve the aforementioned objectives, so as to value human life and uphold justice. We cannot express our urgency enough. The Zhenjiang County Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations, the Zhenjiang County Clean Countryside Work Support Association, and all the people of the county respectfully."</p>
<p>Shanghai Groups Continue to Voice Support</p>
<p>Many people from the Municipal Farmers' Association and other five groups have applied to join the association for Zhang Jin. Participating groups include the Women's Welfare Association, the Chinese Society of Law and Politics, the Shanghai West Citizens' Federation, and dozens of groups such as the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai. The Shanghai Special City Branch of the Chinese Lixie Church, the Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association of this city, the Auction of Secondhand Goods Industry Association, the Research Association of the National Central University, the Overseas Chinese Public Opinion Agency of this city, and the Nantong News Agency have also successively voiced their support for the Zhang case.</p>

<h3>Anti-Epidemic Campaign Enters Final Week, Inspection of Epidemic Prevention Certificates Begins</h3>
<p>The citywide anti-epidemic campaign has reached its final week. Personnel from the Public Concession Health Department and the police authorities have begun to conduct surprise inspections within the concession to check whether residents have epidemic prevention certificates. Yesterday, trams passing through Carter Road and other locations were inspected in sequence by Health Department officials and detectives. Those who did not have epidemic prevention certificates were forced to get injections.</p>
<p>Unhygienic Cold Drinks Prohibited from Hawking</p>

<p>Street Corpses Should Be Buried Quickly</p>
<p>Deceased infants and corpses found on the streets are frequently discovered in urban areas and the two concessions. These are a major impediment to hygiene. It is reported that the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee is now addressing the issue as the weather is getting warmer. If corpses are discovered on the streets, beat police and patrols should immediately report to the responsible police authorities and swiftly notify charitable organizations such as the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to quickly collect and bury the bodies in order to prioritize hygiene and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<h3>35th Period Household Rice on Sale Today</h3>
<p>Rice shops in the two concessions will begin selling household rice for the 35th period today. Each rice purchase certificate can be used to purchase two sheng of whole rice. The sale period runs until the 19th. Residents can use their rice purchase certificates to purchase rice from rice shops with the same assigned number.</p>
<h3>Registration Procedures for Oil Purchases in the Northern District of Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The second round of oil distribution based on housing tax receipts began on the 7th of this month. The oil is purely soybean oil, with a ration of 4 liang per person, and a price of 5.1 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes (including donation). However, the oil distribution method in the naval and police garrison area north of Suzhou Creek is as follows: After receiving notification from the neighborhood chief, the landlord must collect the oil payment and household registration certificates from the subtenants, and then register with the designated retail store. After the store examines and approves the registration, it will issue an oil purchase certificate, one per household. In addition to stating the amount of oil that can be purchased in jin or liang, the certificate will also state the district, bao, jia, and household number, as well as the date of purchase registration. The certificate will also include the detailed address of the retail store and the store's chop. Purchases must be made with this certificate.</p>
<h3>Yi Chang Sugar Company Found Guilty of Malpractice, Supply Suspended for Two Months</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of per capita sugar distribution in the southern district of the city, numerous problems have arisen among retail sugar merchants in the area, both directly and indirectly hindering the implementation of the food policy, which is deeply regrettable. Despite repeated thorough investigations by the Municipal Food Bureau, the malpractice has not been stopped. It is reported that Yi Chang Sugar Company on Li Ma Road in the southern district has been found guilty of malpractice, and authorities have suspended its supply for two months as a warning. Residents throughout the southern district hope that the Standing Bureau can conduct further thorough investigations to eliminate the malpractice in sugar distribution.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Cigarette Factory Busted on Xinzha Road</h3>
<p>Last Saturday afternoon, the Municipal Council Police Department, acting on a tip, dispatched detectives to 421 Lane, Xinzha Road, and arrested two suspects for counterfeiting Great Britain brand cigarettes. One was a cigarette broker, and the other was a tailor. Both were sent to the First Special District Court on charges of counterfeiting and selling counterfeit cigarettes, to be dealt with according to the law. When the police authorities learned the address of the counterfeit cigarette factory, they dispatched police officers to raid the premises at 3:00 PM that afternoon. They first arrested two people in one room, Zhong Bangwan and Kang Wenlong (both transliterations). In another room, they found a cigarette-making machine, 1,000 pounds of tobacco leaves, cigarette rolling paper, and a large quantity of already manufactured counterfeit Great Britain brand cigarettes. The suspects were taken to court. During the preliminary hearing, the suspect Zhong admitted to selling counterfeit cigarettes without hesitation. However, Kang Wenlong flatly denied being an accomplice of Zhong and denied having any knowledge of the sale of counterfeit Great Britain brand cigarettes. As a result, both suspects were remanded in custody pending investigation and are scheduled to be retried next Saturday.</p>

<p>The principals of primary and secondary schools in the Special District held a tea party at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday afternoon to connect and exchange ideas. More than 100 principals from Nanyang Model, Guangxia, Dazhong, Aiguo, Nanyang, and Huxin attended. Lin Jiongan, Director of the Education Bureau, and Zhou Huarong, Secretary-General of the Education Association, also attended to provide guidance. First, Wang, the Principal of Guangxia, reported on the progress of school building maintenance and the special protection for school buildings in the wartime housing rental regulations recently passed by the Central Political Committee. Then, Director Lin and Secretary-General Zhou delivered speeches, expressing their willingness to support and resolve the current difficulties in the education sector and the welfare of colleagues in education. All the principals were inspired. Finally, they discussed the Ministry of Finance's collection of income tax and requested the Education Association to forward it to the authorities. It was decided that income tax would be levied from the next year onwards, with past exemptions. The tuition and miscellaneous fees for primary and secondary schools are tentatively planned to increase uniformly by 50% to 100%, depending on the price situation during the summer vacation. Regarding school buildings, although there is already special legal protection, the maintenance movement will continue by the original responsible persons to prevent accidents. The principals expressed many opinions on other educational issues. It is heard that this tea party will continue to be held when necessary.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Central District Household Census Completed Under Supervision of Food Bureau</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the per capita food distribution system in the city, the supply of food to the people in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts has gradually been brought into order. However, the Food Bureau reviewed the food distribution agencies in each district and found that the central district of the city was still not perfect in all aspects, and the progress of the food policy was hindered both directly and indirectly. Therefore, Chen Shaoting was sent to the central district public office to earnestly supervise the creation of a household census register, in order to make the food distribution more thorough and accurate. It is now learned that the work of supervising the creation of the household census register has now been completed, and the food distribution in the district will be more sound.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Qingxiang Sub-Committee Investigation Team Captures Pseudo-Bandit Leader Xu Dexin, Confiscates Guns and Ammunition</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Report: Gu Baolin, the leader of the investigation team of the Fourth Division of the Shanghai Qingxiang Sub-Committee and the leader of the Third Squad, received a confidential report from team member Tang Xihuai on the morning of the 8th of this month that Xu Dexin, the former regimental commander of the Chongming Guard Regiment of the pseudo-New Fourth Army, was secretly attempting to operate in Baishuitan, Gaoqiao District, Pudong, and was now hiding in the Zhonghe Hotel on Simalu in the Public Concession. He immediately led squad leader Zhang Xuechang and team members Tang Dingyi and Shen Jiawu, under the supervision of Jiao Songqiao, to Room 29 of the Zhonghe Hotel, where they arrested the pseudo-bandit leader Xu Dexin and took him back to the team headquarters for interrogation. According to the suspect, he had various weapons and ammunition hidden in a graveyard in Liushui Dam, Pudong. They then took the suspect to the graveyard and recovered a submachine gun, a fast-slow machine gun, two Mauser pistols, one eight-inch musket, one six-inch musket, 43 bullets, and one hand grenade. All of the items were escorted to the Fourth Division of the Sub-Committee for interrogation at 5:30 PM that afternoon. The suspect also confessed that gang members Guo Fugen, Cai Li, Wang Shilang, Shen Wenjia, and Lu Shen, among others, robbed a seagoing vessel and tens of thousands of yuan worth of rice, cloth, and cash at Ruilai Beach in Baoshan District at 9:00 AM on April 30 and fled without a trace. The team is now conducting a strict investigation.</p>

<h3>Please Temporarily Exempt Teachers from Income Tax</h3>
<p>— Ni Weiqiu</p>
<p>At this time when teachers' lives are extremely difficult, we suddenly hear that the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance has explicitly ordered the collection of income tax from teachers. According to the notice issued to various schools by the Shanghai District Collection Bureau, this is based on the provisions of "Category II Free Professions and Other Practitioners' Salaries and Remuneration Income," so teachers should also be subject to income tax. It is also stated that the income tax due from January 21st to the end of April of this year must be deducted retroactively; starting in May, it will be deducted monthly and handed over to the Central Reserve Bank, which is a major blow to teachers. Teachers are squeezed by speculators and hoarders and are simply unable to make a living. Try asking a three-foot-tall child on the road; "Who is the most miserable person today?" They will surely answer, "The teacher who sits on the cold bench." Today, teachers at all levels of schools have meager salaries. Their monthly income is only used to pay rent, buy rice and flour, and the simplest vegetables; there is no extra money to buy books and newspapers, and there is no extra strength to buy clothes and socks; whether it is mental or material life, they are unable to obtain satisfaction. The government has tried to provide relief, and people from all walks of life have expressed sympathy, or provide free medical treatment, or provide assistance, and the meaning is nothing more than this. The reason why teachers are willing to endure hardship and continue to teach is nothing more than to maintain the cause of education and prevent the vitality of the country and the nation from being broken! Although there are occasionally one or two principals who aim to make profits, the teachers are really without fault; although there are occasionally a few teachers who also engage in speculation and hoarding, most teachers can still work hard and devote themselves to teaching students. Therefore, if you still want to collect income tax from teachers today, it is tantamount to forcing teachers to the road of death and causing the education industry to collapse. Therefore, teachers cannot be treated as the same as general self-employed people, and in this situation where salaries cannot rise at the same time as prices, teachers cannot be treated as the same as general self-employed people. We believe that the financial authorities who love and support the cause of education will definitely be able to understand this situation and give teachers preferential treatment by temporarily exempting them from income tax.</p>
<p>Even more, I can't help but say that it is appalling that the notice orders schools to retroactively deduct teachers' income tax from January 31st to the end of April of this year! According to the "Monthly Taxable Income Calculation Table" attached by the Collection Bureau, the tax rate is very detailed and I will not copy it one by one. Let's assume a monthly salary of 500 yuan, with a monthly deduction of 5.5 yuan. From January 31st to April of this year, there are a total of sixteen months, which means a deduction of 248 yuan; this number is equivalent to half a month's salary, so how will this half-month of life be maintained? Therefore, I deeply hope that the financial authorities can also exempt the income tax for the sixteen months.</p>
<p>Millions of teachers who are waiting for relief will inevitably be panic-stricken after hearing the notice that income tax must be deducted and that sixteen months of income tax must be deducted retroactively. If teachers' income tax cannot be temporarily exempted, then teachers' lives will become more difficult. If the financial authorities can understand the hardships of teachers' lives and explicitly order temporary exemption, then the teachers will be fortunate! Education will be fortunate!</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Second Thorough Investigation of Commodity Hoarding</h3>
<p>Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, after inspecting the recent economic situation in Shanghai, stated to reporters the day before yesterday: "As for the issue of hoarding, it is of course appropriate to take decisive measures." This "succinct and to the point" statement precisely reflects the urgent demand of the people for the government in the past two months.</p>
<p>However, the latest development in the issue of thoroughly investigating commodity hoarding is: "The National Government recently dispatched a second batch of key personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate commodity hoarding and is determined to punish hoarders," and "Shanghai's economic circles also deeply hope that this investigation will produce more concrete facts so that they can cooperate with the National Government's wartime economic policies." We believe that the results of the first thorough investigation of hoarding can only be regarded as a formality; now that we are starting anew, it is appropriate to prescribe the right medicine for the ailment, without being bound by the habit of "bringing the original prescription for a follow-up visit." In other words, this thorough investigation "must be absolutely impartial and break through all considerations of sentiment; if those who should be punished have more powerful backgrounds, they should be punished even more severely." We hope that the second thorough investigation of illegal hoarding can be carried out based on such a spirit of impartiality. Then, with swift and decisive action, government orders will not be difficult to implement thoroughly.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding this continued dispatch of key personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate hoarding, "some people in the economic circles greatly hope that the scope of the investigation will be further expanded and that supervision can be applied to factories producing cotton yarn, silk, and cotton cloth." The explanation of this expression of intent is that to eliminate hoarding, it is necessary to address both the symptoms and the root causes. The shortcut to addressing the root cause is to register all goods stored in warehouses and depots, so that hoarders fundamentally lose their means of concealment. Then, even if they want to take advantage of loopholes, they will find it impossible to do so. Fortunately, the government "is now, with the Ministry of Industry as the center, studying the registration law, and once the review is completed, it will be promulgated by the National Government." All of these things—including the "Regulations on Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities"—must be fulfilled and effectively implemented, which is the most important thing. Yesterday, the press was invited to report on the progress of the preparations.</p>
<h3>National Commercial Control Association: Flour and Wheat Special Committee to Be Established Soon. Yesterday, the Press Was Invited to Report on the Progress of the Preparations</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association has been organized under the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Food and the National Commercial Control Association and will be officially established around the 20th of this month. To make its mission clear to all sectors, the committee invited the city's press to a meeting at Room 309, No. 2 Beijing Road, at 1:00 PM yesterday (the 10th) to report on the progress of preparations and the future direction of work. More than 20 reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers attended. Mr. Sun Zhongli, Chairman of the Special Committee, gave a speech.</p>
<p>He stated briefly: "Our committee, under the command, supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Food and the National Commercial Control Association, has been largely organized. In the meantime, great efforts have been made in contacting and leading domestic colleagues and in consulting and negotiating with colleagues in friendly countries. Fortunately, it has been relatively smooth and satisfactory. This is sufficient to demonstrate the sincere cooperation between the authorities and colleagues on both sides, and it can be a matter of satisfaction to all sectors. The work of control was originally intended to meet the needs of wartime, and food, in particular, is of utmost importance to military needs and people's livelihoods. Among the main food items, apart from rice, are flour and wheat. Previously, the purchase and distribution of flour and wheat were handled by government and business officials from friendly countries. Now, in accordance with the principle of equality agreed upon by the authorities of the two countries, we will cooperate sincerely and hand it over to this committee. Therefore, the composition of this committee is based on the joint association of flour and wheat colleagues from both China and Japan, and the joint association is formed by the flour and wheat trade associations in various places. As for the nature of this committee, it is actually one of the professional committee organizations of the National Commercial Control Association. Its organization consists of a chairman, two vice-chairmen, four executive committee members, eight committee members, one chief supervisor, and four supervisors elected by the aforementioned joint association of colleagues from both China and Japan. Under the chairman, there is a secretary-general and two deputy secretaries, who are responsible for departmental affairs. It is planned to set up eight sections for general affairs, finance, wheat flour bran, review, transportation, factory, and improvement. Each section will have a section chief and a deputy section chief, as well as a number of staff members and assistants, to be responsible for their respective tasks and to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. As for the tasks of this committee, naturally they are the purchase and distribution of wheat, the transportation and sales of flour and bran, the adjustment of prices, the inspection of quality, and other matters concerning the increase and improvement of production, all of which will be handled separately by this committee. In short, the main task of this committee is control, and it is by no means business. This point should be made clear to all parties. Regarding the promotion method, branches will be established in Beijing, Shanghai, and the two municipalities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to strengthen purchase and manufacturing. An appropriate high price for wheat will be set to encourage production, establish a sales system, and distribute it evenly to prevent speculation and hoarding. Adjustments will be made from time to time to eliminate competition, and strict inspections will be carried out to improve quality. Although I, Mr. Inoue, and Mr. Yang Yingmao are relatively familiar with the historical business conditions among our colleagues, we are sincerely grateful for the endorsement of the responsible officials and the senior talents in the industry. We really dare not shoulder this heavy burden, but we feel the importance of the people's food and that we should solve it reasonably. Moreover, commercial control is related to national policy, and we are even more grateful to all parties for their earnest responsibility based on righteousness. Therefore, we have to reluctantly accept the difficult task for the time being. However, we always take responsibility for our work and have an open mind. We will never be perfunctory or careless. This time, in order to serve the community, we should adhere to this principle and be wary of walking on thin ice. We can also let other talents take over at any time. I hope that our authorities and our colleagues will appreciate our sincerity and understand us."</p>
<p>Internal Organization</p>
<p>The internal organization system of the association is divided into one office and eight sections below the committee members to handle tasks, including the Secretary's Office (divided into secretary specialists), General Affairs Section (divided into general affairs, documents, and personnel divisions), Wheat Section (divided into purchase and distribution divisions), Flour Section (divided into transaction and local divisions), Finance Section (divided into accounting and cashier divisions), Review Section (divided into enterprise, capital, investigation, and statistics divisions), Factory Section (divided into construction, materials, and inspection divisions), Transportation Section (divided into transportation, warehouse, and insurance divisions), and Improvement Section (divided into inspection and research divisions).</p>

<h3>National Government Re-investigates Hoarding. It Is Now Underway</h3>
<p>The National Government authorities are determined to thoroughly investigate illegal hoarding in Shanghai's financial and industrial circles. Last time, Financial Vice-Minister Chen Zhishuo was sent to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation, and Futong Commercial Bank was the first to be punished by being ordered to cease operations. However, the authorities not only did not stop the investigation work, but also decided to send senior officials to Shanghai again to conduct a more thorough investigation in order to strengthen the effect of the investigation. It is reported that the second investigation by the National Government authorities has begun, and the dispatched senior officials have also arrived in Shanghai and are now rigorously carrying out various tasks in order to achieve the greatest effect from this investigation. It is also known that after the completion of the investigation in the future, the highest government authorities will impose extremely severe penalties on hoarders in this city, regardless of which side they belong to.</p>
<h3>After Supplementary Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, Applications for Movement Are Allowed</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association previously held a registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, which was of a relatively short duration, and holders may have been unable to register in time. However, in order to take into account the actual difficulties of merchants, the association's board of directors and supervisors specially resolved to allow a supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai Special City. After this supplementary registration period expires, a spot check will be carried out. If unregistered cotton yarn and cotton cloth are found, they will not be allowed to enjoy the rights of buying, selling, and moving, and they will be punished according to law. It is reported that the supplementary registration period will run from yesterday (the 10th) to the 15th.</p>
<p>It is also reported that for cotton yarn and cotton cloth that have already been registered, if they need to be transported outside the Shanghai area (i.e., the control line), they may apply for a permit from the Materials Movement Permit Office of the association in Hamilton Building in accordance with Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Control of Wartime Materials Movement, and then be allowed to move out. The Municipal Government Ordered the Economic Bureau to Send Personnel to Attend</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Convened the Spring Cocoon Evaluation Meeting. The Municipal Government Ordered the Economic Bureau to Send Personnel to Attend</h3>
<p>In order to evaluate the price of cocoons for this period in view of the imminent arrival of spring cocoons, the Ministry of Industry has scheduled to convene a cocoon price evaluation committee in the ministry on May 15 to jointly discuss issues related to the sales of silkworm eggs in various places, the price of mulberry leaves, labor costs, and miscellaneous expenses, as well as the production cost materials of spring cocoons. The Municipal Government of this city has approved the ministry's request and has ordered the Economic Bureau to assign personnel to attend and provide various relevant materials for transfer.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong to Ban the Circulation of Hong Kong Dollars from Next Month</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 10th (Central News Agency) In order to consolidate security, revive and develop the general livelihood of the people, the Hong Kong Governor's Office has decided to use military currency as the sole currency from June 1 and to ban the circulation of Hong Kong dollars in the jurisdiction. Governor's Order No. 26, the "Currency Regulations for the Occupied Territory of Hong Kong," was promulgated on the 10th, and at the same time, a public notice was issued regarding the exchange of military currency and Central Reserve Bank notes after the implementation of the regulations. However, the exchange of Hong Kong dollars with military currency and Central Reserve Bank notes was also announced on the same day in Public Notice No. 29. The exchange amount and import and export amount that do not require permission are set at 200 yuan, and the exchange rate is 18 yuan of Hong Kong military currency for 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. The exchange period for holders of Hong Kong dollars will end from the 10th to the 31st. Hong Kong dollar deposits will also be converted to military currency deposits. The settlement of general debts will also be based on military currency, and the exchange settlement ratio will be one to four. Such unification of currency within Hong Kong's jurisdiction will not only stabilize the economic circles under its jurisdiction, but will also be quite promising for the upward development of its capabilities in the future. Moreover, the fact that no premiums were applied this time when the circulation of Hong Kong dollars was banned is sufficient to demonstrate the Governor's Office's policy of adapting to the actual situation and respecting the people's sentiments.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks to Resume Operations Next Week</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Works Department suddenly sent personnel to the 15 Chinese stock companies that had already obtained licenses issued by the Shanghai Special City Economic Affairs Department to tear off the seals that had been affixed earlier. Most of the stock companies are now preparing to resume operations no later than Monday of next week. However, after the market opens, companies that have not been unsealed and do not have licenses will be treated as trustees and clients and are currently being discussed. The list of stock companies that have been unsealed is recorded below: Yongchang, Wufu, Xinfeng, Changxing, Wufeng, Xingye, Huashang, Xinfu, Baofeng, Cunde, Zhongguo, Changcheng, Dagong, Xinchang, Chengde</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks turned from strong to weak, because the prices had already been raised high on the afternoon of the last weekend, and soon they were suppressed by those who wanted to sell to cash out. The stock prices are still hovering within a narrow range. The official resumption of operations is approaching, and people's minds have stabilized. New pharmaceutical companies traded the most actively, with Xin Asia Pharmaceutical Factory being firm and unwavering. China-France Pharmacy was slightly sluggish. Department stores saw highs and slightly sold off. Wing On and Guohuo Companies saw slight gains, while Sincere Company was flat. Underwear rose slightly. Wing On Textile Factory rose slightly. Meiya Silk Factory traded well. The market was also firm. The transaction prices of the cultural industry's Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore were thin and stagnant. The public utilities Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric are still falling, with supply exceeding demand. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has not shaken off its sluggishness, and Great China Match is flat. Jiu'an Industrial has made slight progress.</p>

<h3>Fundamental Countermeasures to Eliminate Speculation (2)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(4) Comprehensive price limits should not be tolerated. Regional price limits in the past are no longer sufficient. Now that the restrictions on the movement of materials have been relaxed, comprehensive price limits are even more urgent. Because, due to the thorough investigation of hoarding and the limitation of prices, speculators will use the relaxation of the restrictions on the movement of materials to move materials to places with higher prices and looser controls. The movement of materials, in essence, is to destroy the control system. Therefore, the crackdown on hoarding and the limitation of prices should be consistent nationwide in order to be effective. Comprehensive price limits should be set by the National Government authorities based on the production cost of each material in its place of origin, so that all regions can use this as a standard, and they should also refer to the special sales conditions and freight costs in each region to make appropriate increases or decreases to serve as the official price in each region.</p>
<p>(5) The people's understanding of control and their cooperation in eliminating hoarding should not be ignored. The above four points all use the power of the government to eliminate hoarding. However, it is not enough to use only the power of the government to do this difficult work. In addition, we must rely on the cooperation of the people, so that the advancement can be smooth. For the people, we can say it in two ways: First, we must expand propaganda to make the people have a clear understanding of control in order to eliminate past misunderstandings. And actively encourage the people's patriotism. Make them understand the responsibilities that the people should bear in wartime. The psychological correction and the enrichment of recognition are also sufficient to reduce the occurrence of speculation and hoarding. Second, when speculation has gone crazy and national accumulation has become rampant, for the sake of thorough investigation, we must rely on the cooperation of the people. For this point, we should pay attention to the following points: (A) Strengthen the people's organization to strengthen the relationship between the government and the people; (B) Launch a "Hoarding Tiger Elimination Week" to guide the people to work together with the government and jointly participate in the struggle to eliminate hoarding; (C) Reward people's reporting; (D) Use the Baojia system to make people supervise each other, and let the Baojia head be responsible for investigating whether the inventory of each family exceeds normal needs. If hoarding or exceeding normal needs is found, it must be reported to the authorities, otherwise the Baojia head will also be severely punished. This is also of great help to the elimination of hoarding.</p>
<p>In short, speculative hoarding must be thoroughly eliminated and fundamentally eradicated, otherwise, not only will economic disturbances be unimaginable, but also in politics, there may be adverse consequences. We sincerely hope that the Changju will no longer ignore its seriousness and no longer have perfunctory and irresponsible actions such as "catching small fish and letting go of big fish."</p>

<h3>Don't Waste Yourself</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>Malnutrition, poor mood, and various other factors can easily make people age, wither, and even die easily. This situation is especially serious after the war. But in addition to nutrition and mood, many people do not know how to cherish themselves, casually wasting their precious mental and physical strength, resulting in a decline in appearance and the full exposure of disease symptoms, which is also a common fact.</p>
<p>Since the rampant prevalence of hoarding and speculation, the atmosphere in the cities has become even more filled with decadence. Places of waste are everywhere, such as all-night mahjong games, hedonistic flower-sniffing and willow-seeking, and drunken revelry reminiscent of Li Bai... These kinds of things are commonplace among the wealthy, and even in ordinary gatherings, there is a frenzied atmosphere. Strictly speaking, this way of seeking pleasure at the expense of oneself is extremely harmful to the body and mind.</p>
<p>People who are full and warm all day long and have nothing to apply their minds to are inevitably addicted to their hobbies and used to lingering. They are especially prone to going down the road of waste. Although they have the money to eat nutritious food rich in vitamins and can often take supplements, for people who waste themselves on a daily basis, the supplementation and consumption offset each other, and in any case, it is "not worth the loss." This is because the result of waste will gradually numb your nerves, relax your muscles, and disrupt the normal function of your metabolism. No wonder, according to eugenics, people who are well-fed and well-dressed, because they "waste time and neglect their duties" and live a life of drunken stupor, are generally weak and incompetent in terms of their mental intelligence and physical strength.</p>
<p>A person's weakness and illness naturally have to do with congenital deficiencies or acquired imbalances, as well as complex factors such as economics. However, indifference to physical education, which promotes the average development and harmony of the body and mind, and never exercising, is also a major reason. As for those who not only do not pay attention to physical education but also casually waste their body and mind, the result of harming their ambitions and damaging their nature is even more boundless. We have seen some people who were originally healthy and strong and full of energy, but due to the influence of frequent waste, they became decadent and unrecognizable in less than a year or two. There are also young people who, after running a few more steps or climbing a few flights of stairs, will gasp for breath, and sometimes they will find it difficult to bend over and turn sideways to pick up things that have fallen on the ground. It is even more incomprehensible that they have formed an inexplicable connection with strange and bizarre diseases.</p>
<p>Although people who do not waste their body and mind may also have a pale complexion in form, this is probably due to having experienced hardships or "laboring their muscles and bones and afflicting their minds." Therefore, it does not matter if a person looks a little older in form, as long as they do not waste their body and mind and use their precious mental knowledge and abilities to benefit themselves and others, then they will feel at ease and justified, which is much better than those who are well-fed and well-dressed but are "outwardly strong but inwardly weak."</p>
<p>If the body and mind are not wasted but only exercised in youth, the spiritual vitality will definitely be abundant and vigorous, and there will definitely be great achievements. And if you reach old age, you can at least reduce a lot of pain in terms of mental and physical health. But to achieve this, you must have pure ideas, because only in this way can you recognize the "long-term significance."</p>
<h3>"Jealousy" and "Shooting Cold Arrows"</h3>
<p>— Ji Wei Yi</p>
<p>"Jealousy" seems to have become a common ailment among people in society, taking deep root. Because of "jealousy," society does not know how many disputes and how many misfortunes have occurred. But "jealousy" still spreads widely.</p>
<p>"Jealous" people are often inferior to others (not absolutely).</p>
<p>People with heavy "jealous" hearts tend to be extremely concerned about other people's affairs. If others are unsuccessful, they will take a cold, hard look at it with an attitude of "rejoicing in misfortune." If others succeed and surpass them, then "jealousy" will arise. Usually, two kinds of results will occur.</p>
<p>The cause of "jealousy" is because of being inferior to others, so when they see the success of others, they will spontaneously develop a competitive heart, wanting to work hard to advance before others, or at least "keep pace." This is a positive and aboveboard result.</p>
<p>The other kind of result of "jealousy" is completely different. He tries hard to find some small mistake of the successful person, even if this mistake is as small as a hair. As long as he can "nitpick" and "talk nonsense," he will not hesitate to use despicable means to shoot a few cold arrows and slander others... This attitude is unacceptable.</p>
<p>We are young, we need a life full of "enthusiasm," and we need solemn faces that are kind and friendly. If when we first enter society, we see only cunning and sly faces that are neither smiling nor not smiling, it is natural that we will suffer a major setback.</p>
<p>Although a person always has to suffer some setbacks before success, this kind of deliberately formed obstacle is largely unnecessary under a sound system. If this world is full of "jealousy" in the form of "shooting cold arrows," what would this world become?</p>
<p>In a movie theater, two young men, properly spaced, occupied three seats, with one empty in the middle, with a sign on it.</p>
<p>Old men, strong men, young men, and children all asked in turn.</p>
<p>"Someone," they got the same answer. A pretty miss came over: "Is anyone sitting here..."</p>
<p>"No one, no one. Please sit, please sit." Quickly, gently, and unanimously.</p>
<h3>Knowledge and Action</h3>
<p>— Zhen Qiao Ge</p>
<p>In the first paragraph of the second part of Hai Lun Jun's article in this journal on the 28th, it is written that "theory and fact are completely two different things," and it also says, "So we must develop the habit of saying and doing." Here, we have to add something.</p>
<p>Although, "having only theory and not working down to earth" will "never become a reality"; however, I believe that "simply working down to earth" without the guidance of "theory" is blind work. Perhaps there will be the hope of "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there seems to be no way out, willows are dark and flowers are bright, and another village appears," but this hope is too slim! The result of doing without theory is definitely small and will "be realized."</p>
<p>"Being able to do what you say" seems to be "beneath" the "scholars" (?) in China. Didn't Mr. Sun Yat-sen say, "It is difficult to know but easy to do"? Therefore, some "scholars" who believe that "everything is inferior, only studying is superior" consider themselves to be small "theorists." They are only responsible for the establishment of "theory" and not responsible for the responsibility of practice. "Action" should belong to the farmers, merchants, workers, and soldiers who are "everything is inferior"! Therefore, all meaningful movements are "only heard the sound of the floorboards, but no one is seen coming down." Regarding what Mr. Sun Yat-sen said about "it is difficult to know but easy to do," we must recognize that Mr. Sun Yat-sen told us that after we know—that is, after the "theory" is established—as long as we are willing to work hard and are willing to sacrifice, things will definitely succeed; however, it does not mean that after we know, things will naturally succeed! This point, we cannot not recognize!</p>
<p>Therefore, theory is the basis of practice, but practice must be attached to theory. Therefore, we must turn "theory and fact" into one thing, that is, "say and do," which is also Wang Yangming's "unity of knowledge and action."</p>
<h3>Respect Women</h3>
<p>— Yu Huai Rui</p>
<p>In a crowded tram, a young man sat sideways, leisurely looking at the city streets outside the window.</p>
<p>A frail old man, pleadingly smiled: "Sir, can you please move over a little?"</p>
<p>"Look, how can I squeeze in!" The reply was full of impatience.</p>
<p>The car stopped, and a beautiful miss came up.</p>
<p>The young man stood up suddenly, and with an ingratiating smile: "Miss, please sit down."</p>
<p>At the side of a not-very-wide escalator in a certain building, Xiao Zhang and Lao Huang were preparing to step up when a pretty miss came up behind them. Xiao Zhang pulled Lao Huang to the side very politely.</p>
<p>Lao Huang: "What's wrong? Have you broken your creed of 'first come, first served' that you have always followed today?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zhang: "Fool, I can enjoy the scenery... let my eyes eat ice cream!"</p>
<p>Lao Huang: "Um..."</p>
<h3>The Family Life of a Salaried Class</h3>
<p>— Jian Qing</p>
<p>The changes of the great era, like a drama, become more and more tense as it plays out. Those who make a fortune from the nation's troubles, and those greedy and insatiable hoarders and manipulators, each use their skills, performing one trick after another with great enthusiasm, exceeding all limits. However, for the salaried class, it is already extremely difficult. With a fixed income, they struggle to cope with the infinitely rising black market, barely making ends meet, living beyond their means. Savings are out of the question, as the so-called "good times get better, hard times get harder." In the past, I transitioned from business to politics, only to encounter a disaster that left me with nothing. In the spring of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], I moved from my hometown to Shanghai, relying on others. My income barely covered my expenses. Four years ago, living in Shanghai with a family of seven, we could still afford to hire a maid, which was just enough to maintain a basic standard of living. In recent years, the cost of living in Shanghai has skyrocketed, and our family has grown by two, naturally increasing the burden of clothing and food. We dismissed the maid long ago, and I struggle with household chores myself, getting up before dawn, sweeping and washing dishes, starting the stove, and folding quilts. Everyone, young and old, cooperates and shares the work. After the children finish their tasks, they wash, have breakfast, and go to school. We instill in them the spirit of endurance and hard work from a young age. On my part, I am frugal and cautious, never daring to indulge in smoking, drinking, gambling, or prostitution. I have no time to frequent entertainment venues. I am heavily burdened by the pressures of making a living in this era. Even though my monthly salary is now 1,200 yuan, it is difficult to manage and often feels like robbing Peter to pay Paul when trying to cover family expenses. Food alone accounts for 70% of my monthly salary (because the monthly ration of rice for urban residents does not meet our needs, and we must buy an additional eight dou [approximately 80 liters] of black market rice each month). Daily vegetables, oil, sugar, and miscellaneous expenses account for 55%. Rent and school fees account for 15% (four children in school). Socializing, purchases, and medical expenses are not fixed monthly, averaging about 30%.</p>
<p>Based on the above allocation, and by stretching and patching things together, I still run a deficit of 700 to 800 yuan each month. However, I dare not show weakness to my relatives and friends, at least not outwardly. The pain of hidden poverty, how can it be expressed? I imagine that many salaried people share the same lament. I still remember when I lived in the capital, with a family of six and two servants, eight people in total, my monthly income was only one or two hundred yuan, yet we lived comfortably and felt at ease. I truly can't bear to look back. All I can do is sigh helplessly. (No compensation received).</p>

<p>Currently, prices are soaring, and life is becoming increasingly difficult. The various charitable organizations in the city are operating many shelters and care institutions, with a large number of people eagerly awaiting food, some even facing starvation. The urgency of the situation is beyond what ordinary people can imagine. We sincerely hope that leaders from all industries and philanthropists from all walks of life will quickly contribute donations to support this good cause, so that the Association can continue to carry out its subsidy and relief work, allowing the remaining population after the war to avoid starvation. Saving the people and saving the nation, how can the merits be measured?</p>
