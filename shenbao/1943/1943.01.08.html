<h3 id="c1">革新政治風氣 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨日社評談修明政治，就治本與治標兩方面，有所獻議，不過，我們要實現修明政治，探覺目前流行的那種政治風氣，實有首先加以整飭和革新的必要。正如論語所說，「政者正也，子師以正，孰敢不正？季康子患盜，問於孔子，孔子對曰，苟子之不欲，雖賞之不竊，其身正，不令而行，其身不正，雖令不從」。孟子也說，「德之流行，速於置郵而傳命，當今之世，萬乘之國，行仁政，民之悅之，猶解倒懸也」。現在我們復興民族，要中日眞正協力，要担負時代的使命，人人知道要强化政府的力量，而政府力量之强化，首先就得把中國政治上積累下來的舊風氣加以澈底的革新。</p>
<p>革新政治風氣，必須健全政治基層，也就是健全政府的根木。現在的政治基層是怎樣呢？有些地方的土豪劣紳，地痞流氓，有的倚仗日方的聲威，有的倚仗自家識得高官大吏，有的憑藉政黨的職權，橫行鄉里，弁髦法令，欺凌小民，自私自利，他們來做事，老實說，毫不明瞭工作的意義的。像這樣的政治基層若不迅速澈底改革，尤其是從下層政治工作人選開始，那怕你有很良善的政令法制，也不過多給土豪劣紳以作惡的工具與機會而已。</p>
<p>其次，舊作風的特點（一）在上級政府方面，不是法令太繁，使下級政府無力執行，便是發布法令的機關太多，往往同一政令，不能統一，使下級政府無所遵從。不是各種法令不能盡適合於地方情形，往往不易推行，便是上級政府不了解下級政府的眞實情形，而爲下級政府所不能遵行的命令。不是上級對於法令未能切實監察和考核，便是法令的變動性太多，使執行者應接不暇。（二）在縣級政府方面，大多數是機構不健全，無力推行政令，以致敷衍塞責，進而陽奉陰違，進而作虛僞之呈報。而且普通是衙門方式，各公務員只知當差辦公簽到上班，對法令如何，縣政如何，人民疾苦如何，都不過問。不是由於上司太多，往往直接對縣府下命令者約有十數機關，使縣府無力應付，便是縣長兼職太多，每日除批閱公文，出席會議：即無休息，學習，思考，計劃，推動，監督，糾正，考核之時間。這一切結果，是良好的政令束諸高閣，一般的政令被宵小利用以貽害小民。所以今日與革新政治風氣，更須著關於各級政府間關係之改善。</p>
<p>但是，要認眞革新政治風氣，還必須有新的幹部，必須努力培養和敎育幹部，特別是在各級政府提拔新的人才，注入新的血液。而是要注重於認識幹部，分配他們以適當的工作，使他們各得發揮所長。而是要「選賢使能」吸收各方面的人才，不要爲一般的黨派，思想和資格所拘泥，主要的是「任賢使能」不要「用人唯親」。</p>
<p>最重要的，我們不談革新政治風氣則已：如果眞正有意於革新政治風氣，那麼，第一要做到國父孫中山先生所說的原則，「人民有權，政府有能」。因為「政治是衆人之事」，人民是政治的主體，也就是古人所說，「民爲邦本，本固而國治」。所以政府是替人民辦事的機關，應該有能。不過，國民旣爲國家之主人翁，而必須眞正有權。只有民氣發揚，國家才有前途。只有民衆擁護，政府的威信與力量才能强化。</p>
<p>革新政治風氣，是修明政治的前提，是加强政府實力的前提，是國民精神和物質總動員的前提，也是中日眞正協力的前提。</p>

<p>柏林七日同盟社電　德軍司令部六日曾說明東綫德軍冬營陣地情形稱、德軍於東部戰綫之防禦戰術、已大加變更、去冬德軍以主力集於後方、最前綫之防禦極爲脆弱、此次則已構築强力之梯形刺蝟狀態之陣綫、並準備大量武器彈藥、以備冬季作戰之用、此項獨立陣地、在敵軍突破最前綫侵入之時、能單獨展開防禦戰、如蘇軍以大部隊侵入梯形陣地、則不能顧全後方部隊取得連絡、例如五日據守某陣地之德軍、即單獨擊退蘇軍進攻達八次之多、並毀其戰車三十五輛云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日同盟社電　據此間所接東綫消息、東綫南部戰况、自德軍整備反攻態勢後、即呈白熱化、計自斯達林城起至高加索中部止、德蘇兩軍不分晝夜展開死鬥、戰况形似拉鋸、該方面蘇軍作戰目標在羅斯托夫、故蘇軍沿斯城羅斯托夫鐵道及斯城格拉斯諾達爾鐵道西進，並以另一部兵力由高加索中部之那利奇克·勃羅弗拉特奴·向西北挺進、直趨羅斯托夫、目下德蘇兩軍在斯城西南一百二十公里之莫洛索夫斯克附近地帶、一再爭奪戰略要地、六日蘇軍當局所發作之戰報中、曾謂該方面德軍已得有力之戰車及步兵增援、反攻力已大增强云云、頗足以暗示蘇軍進攻未能如意進行、聞高加索之摩斯托克·勃羅弗拉特奴地區、在數目上較佔伏勢之蘇軍、似已採取突破戰術、又斯城南方約二百公里裏海沿岸之撒爾特諾埃附近、刻正展開激戰、</p>
<p>蘇聯邊境某地六日哈瓦斯社電　本日蘇聯前綫戰事、中北兩路平靜、南路活躍、茲分述如下、（一）維里基盧基區無可注意之處、該處紅軍攻勢殆已挫折、並受阻於德軍冬季建築之堅固工事、（二）斯達林城正南及西南、正有酣戰、紅軍承認德軍已在該區及頓河中游前綫增援、紅軍戰報中稱紅軍繼續向原來方面進攻、但並不提及地名、此間各觀察家認爲德軍佔據唐納資區後、即可控制自西徂東之六大鐵路綫、並得在某一重要軍略區域集中、紅軍如沿伏朗尼茲—羅斯托夫鐵路進攻、此一區域及爲必爭之地、紅軍茍向該方面作何推進、則兩翼空虛、必將受德軍攻擊、（三）諾伏洛西斯克區並無大戰、若干日前發動之攻勢、似已成爲局部性質、（四）高加索區戰事甚爲活躍、兩軍正在台萊克區大戰中、</p>

<p>— 季庸</p>
<p>一月五日自澳門轉到</p>
<p>摘錄旅行新疆</p>
<p>身邊瑣事數段</p>
<p>十月二十日，自蘭州到酒泉，八時自蘭起飛，十一時到酒泉，下機後即聽說前面黃沙障天，不能飛行，我也樂得在此停留一日。飯後遊城，見街市廣闊，已具規模，不似二十七年路過時那樣荒凉滿目了。有新開到的渝軍約一連，在街心穿過。小孩不着褲子的仍多。西北水利不發達與過去治吏不重民生，爲西北貧苦的主因，盼地方官多在「救貧」上着眼。遇海關馮君，他是去年由蘭州奉命來此籌設分關的，稅收以羊毛，皮革，藥材等出口貨物爲大宗。他來此不到一年，最感痛苦的是無精神食糧，報紙刊物，非一月後不到，航空班件也不定。馮君說，「在西北服務慢慢把一個人弄成耳目失聰，眞是害怕。」他的話，可代表在西北服務智識份子一致的感覺。</p>
<p>十月二十一日晨六時即起，到機塲看朝暾，太陽從祁連山麓昇起，一團火紅，煞是好看。八時半又起飛，十一時到哈密，住城內招待所，飯後遊市郊。我前次過哈密都在下午，始終沒得機會一睹哈密眞面目，這次在郊外漫步二小時，才知道哈密並非如我理想中的沙漠城，而是沙漠中的綠洲。全城被溪水環繞，兩岸遍植楊柳，滿地蔬菜，田疇交錯。聞溪水係自數十里外的山雪融化而來，分成若干段，隨地可引渠導水，灌溉農田。此地產大白菜有高三尺的，土壤之佳，於此可見。</p>

<p>談到戰時政治社會，當然要以戰時首都爲中心。華盛頓在今日顯與戰前不同了，第一個印像是人多。凡是要到華盛頓來的人，第一件要事是預訂住所，否則要患無處安身之苦，旅館的空隙已不如昔日那樣寬裕，朋友家的房子早有貴客先在。世界聞名的白宮，竟亦破例接客，從前的幾間冷靜屋子，現在常住有國際上賓。人多不算奇，尤其引人注目的，是他們鮮明不一的外表，以皮膚而觀，有白色，黃色，棕色，灰色，黑色，及其他描寫不出的　色。如再以眼睛，頭髮，服裝，語言而觀，更不知要分若干類。他們有來自本洲或數千數萬里之外，毫無疑問的，他們在各自社會之中，都佔有重要位置。</p>
<p>飮食隨着「住宿」而高貴，飯館的供應已不是隨時可以得到的了：在路旁賣食物攤上買零食果腹的，大有人在，這不是說他們無錢供給盛餐，而是說他們要節省時間。前幾個月在白宮門口，有一身材矮矮的人購買花生米，以他的衣服而觀，不像是美國人，以他的面貌而觀，頗像蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，過了若干天，報紙公布出來，那個花生攤的顧客，果然是蘇聯外長莫洛托夫。</p>
<p>第二個印像是匆忙。最好的代表所在是車站，或交通工具停留處。大凡身處其境者，必須暫棄呼吸，聚精會神，把握機會向你的目標急進，否則要遭同道人的白眼。點綴在「匆忙」空間的是醒目的壁畫，警告人多作事，少講話。畫中有一個很漂亮人的嘴竟爲橡皮帶而封閉，看來眞是有傷美觀，或者因爲美國人歡喜講話而故意宣揚這樣玩意。總之，講話已成爲戰時動員中一件討厭事。</p>
<p>華盛頓新設立的機關甚多，如有公事接洽，最好事前詳細探明他們的職掌，免得碰壁。</p>
<p>國會開會的時候，比前更形熱鬧，現在在會議塲中常聽到一句警惕話，「只議事，不議人。「聽說這句話是羅斯福爲事勢需要而發明的，也是他促進團結，推進政務的一種最有效的工具。（三十一年十一月二十八日澳門轉寄）</p>

<p>（中央社滬訊）日陣軍報這部發言人於昨（七）日下午二時、在招待中日記者席上、發表擊滅美渝空軍、擬對和平區作濫在轟炸之幻夢、據日發言人談、自渝航空根據地退至昆明後、美駐渝航空司令、竟有濫炸和平區域各都市之計劃、然該項有組織之計劃、終爲日空軍予以重創而宣告失敗、</p>
<p>重大打擊</p>
<p>發言人繼謂、渝方此種行為、實爲虛張聲勢、單獨決不敢試嚐轟炸和平區之舉、初力言攻窺緬越計劃、即足證已無攻擊和平區之表現、當巍越緬之時、僅空軍之游擊戰而已、於此　見渝空軍力之薄弱、並自日本航空部隊偵悉、美空軍根據地遷至昆明後、即予以重大打擊、進而撲滅之查美在渝之航空部隊、僅內定五連、惟因美運渝路綫困難、早為日本所封鎖、故今駐渝部隊、因無從補充、實祗有三連、且每連不過五人、今次經日軍痛加攻擊、損失慘重、此三連中、已有一連消滅、並有一連潰減半數以上、是以渝美空軍實力减削、可見諸一般矣、</p>
<p>渝美摩擦</p>
<p>以不渝清空軍、目前斷難　和平區進取攻勢、際此一二月中、氣候不良、空軍難以活動、然我人母存樂觀、且亦嚴密防範、蓋當於氣候轉佳時、渝美空軍或將利用遊擊倫襲機會、此當可預想者、再查渝空軍目下之實力、目去歲十二月間、由美予以補充十架後、今不過足九十架、渝雖有冀美大量援助之想、但因長距離運輸困難、美難以設法輸送、旋述及渝曾宣稱、有與美聯合攻擊和平區之圖、嗣後渝美兩間芥蒂叢生、明爭暗鬥頗烈、自渝航空部長毛邦初與美駐華司令官之意見相左、該項企圖遂告崩潰、此乃爲不能實現之最大原因、亦即爲渝美磨擦內江之特微表現、</p>
<p>設備粗陋</p>
<p>渝美空軍之旣不能合作、日空軍乃利用其弱點、進攻渝美在昆明之根據地、故迭收奇效、同時、渝方之防空設備組陋異常、尤以民間防空設備、更爲淺惡、一經日軍馳往轟炸、無法擋阻、日發言人最後又告、渝方正規軍隊並無適當設備、例如大別山戰爭一役、絲毫未見渝軍有空軍協助、故其作戰力頗爲薄弱、最近渝方官塲廣播、謂日軍於元旦轟炸江西贛州等地、且有政治日報館址悉爲炸燬、無法出版、於一二兩日聯合出版、由此可足　渝方無底抗戰之途日窮、</p>

<p>杉村廣藏—日本</p>
<p>生活必需品工業及雜工業，在向外地移駐的塲合，必須考慮其給予日本經濟之影響，而硏求最適當的對策。</p>
<p>本村正道—滿洲</p>
<p>（一）滿洲國生產力擴充所必要的資材，大部分取給于日本，所以，在對滿供給所預定的限度內，望將物資盡量急速確實地向滿洲送出。</p>
<p>（二）還有，在貿易方面，因爲主點就在對日關係上，日本一切機構制度之變　在在都足給滿洲以極大影響之故，在滿洲方面，必須和日本呼應而硏求最適當的措置對策。</p>
<p>姜佐宣—華中</p>
<p>（一）爲華中物資交流障碍之除去計，一方面須急　配給機構之整頓改善，同時，又須努力使中日同業者間的連絡，密切起來，以期配給之得以更臻完善。</p>
<p>（二）在可能範圍內，望能緩和對和平區各地域之取締，以期將價格壓低。</p>
<p>宗方丈夫—蒙疆</p>
<p>（一）對需給加以綜合的檢討，對相互依存制度加以深化，俾可澈底打破割據主義。</p>
<p>（二）以日本爲中心，對滙兌政策，物價政策等，加以一元地調整，俾使由于各地域問物資不平均之困難，得以迎刃而解。</p>
<p>（三）輸送力之增强，是最必要的。所以，物資搬運用的燃料等，務求排除萬難，迅予配給。</p>
<p>岩石雄二郎—日本</p>
<p>在目前情勢下，交易增加是頗困難的。不得已而求其次，望能將日本工業設備中一部分東西，向外地移植。</p>

<p>法租界消　防禦第二期總報告書（一九四二年十四日至二十三日）、</p>
<p>總觀察</p>
<p>第二期內之警戒警報、時間甚長、此點與第一期演習（即一九四二年十月一日至十日）之情形不同、例如於十二月二十日即星期日下午六時開始之警戒警報、直至同月二十三日即星期三下午八時始戒除之、此項長時間之警戒警報、　警察署及民警團長期努力工作、因有許多居民、於日落時或日出時、忘却警戒警報之存在、而竟未用窗簾遮蔽、而先已開燈、但本警察署人員對於此種情形、並未遇到任何困難、因居民規對於消極防空總則、尤其關於燈火管制章程之執行、已成習慣、故警察署之工作、得保甲人員之協助、結果甚爲滿意、各區保甲人員辦事熱心忠誠、</p>
<p>特別觀察</p>
<p>十二月十四日、警戒警報於日落六小時前即開始、　許多住戶及商店、於日落時開燈未予注意、幸在馬路上服務之警察署人員及民警團干涉之下、大部份於三十秒鐘後即將燈光遮蔽、　空襲警報期間、大公寓房屋內燈光之遮蔽、較十月間演習　佳、在十月間演習期內、公用車輛尚無燈號　備、但現今在停車時、有很顯明之燈光、用人力拉推之車輛、大體對於燈光遮蔽設備不週、而於警報時間祗將燈光熄滅、在此第期內、有許多行人小知在左面人行道上行走之必要、而乘脚踏車在空襲警報期內仍不下車、故曾糾正之、總之、第一日結果大體上滿意、</p>
<p>十二月十五日、第一次空襲警報（九時二十分至十一時）此乃第一次在本市內口間空襲警報、所有公用車輛及私人車輛、均停止行駛、但曾發生困難、在路上之人、尚不知應採取何種措置、</p>
<p>十二月十七日、警戒警報九時至零時、空襲警報十時至十一時一次、十四時至十五時一次、及二十時至二十一時三十分一次、日落時燈光之遮蔽大爲進步、惟居民之未與留心者仍不在少數、故曾就彰明較著名與以處罰、日間發第二次空襲警報時、成績頗爲滿意、尤以步行人之能遵守紀律、値得表明、車輛亦無越規行動、</p>
<p>十二月十九日、十八時所發之警戒警報（路燈照常開放、）至二十日上午六時始解除、是日成績之美、與前一日同、惟少數居民間有不知警戒時之路燈不熄、須待警士及自警團員之通知、始行將燈光完全遮蔽、</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>據此次救護及遮蔽燈光之演習觀之公務人員方面大有進步、居民之能遵守紀律亦有進步、因克知公共利益之維持、端賴私人之努力也、公衆之誠意、本租界保甲人員之努力、救火會衛生處及看護人員熱心盡職、尤堪嘉獎、此外、在二次最困難之演習中、證明消積防禦機關及担任救護大本營之衛慈醫院、在一旦上海果遭空襲時、伊等必能克盡厥職也、</p>

<h3 id="c78">撞鐘 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 忠毅</p>
<p>俗語裏有一句話：「做一日和尚撞一日鐘」，大家都以爲那是一種「得過且過」的人生態度，極要不得的；但是我以爲這在另一方面，却也可以象徵一種積極的精神，那關鍵全在你撞得如何？你若懶洋洋地漫不經心的去撞，那鐘聲自然不會淸晰雄偉，絲毫沒有感動人的力量。反之，你若全神貫注地去撞，效果自然不同，而你也變成一個好和尚了。</p>
<p>說得明白些，自古及今，個個人都是撞鐘的和尚，不過撞出來的聲音有不同罷了；有的是含糊的，微細的，低到甚至聽不出的，有的却能振起人們的精神，驚醒人們的迷夢，聲聞宇宙，響徹塵寰，區別也就只在這裏。</p>
<p>再看古來聖賢，有的席不暇暖，被髮纓冠地奔走：有的發憤忘食，學道以濟世：推其目的，也無非想做個撞鐘的好和尚。他們的鐘聲，自能長留於天地，而永不泯滅。</p>
<p>我們都須積極的撞鐘，無論自己是任何階級，任何社會裏的人，苟志於善，必能撞出雄偉遠揚的鐘聲。</p>

<p>— Lincoln　Schuster著　古心譯</p>
<p>我年輕的時候正像被人趕到這世界上來的，旣沒有指導，也沒有訓練，或者說，壞得不能再壞，我可以不怕羞地承認，比我犯着更深的罪惡的，簡直是少的。僥倖，我的路終於在適當的時間停止了——在我獲得絕對毀滅之前——許多年來，我慢慢地，辛苦地，向上爬羞，屢跌屢起地向較佳的事情爬着。我回過頭去看看，究竟什麼東西救贖了我呢？不死的希望呢還是將來獎賞的希望呢？我能够老實地說，在這十四年來，我的頭腦中就從來沒有過這種念頭。的確沒有，我可以告訴你究竟有什麼東西在活動着。衣裳哲學（Sartor　Resartus）使我知道，深深的宗敎感是可以和神學的完全否認並存的。第二，科學和她的方法，給了我一個獨立而不屬於權威和傳統的休息處。第三，愛對我開放了人類天性上聖潔的境界，用深深的責任為使我發生了印象。</p>
<p>如果這時我不是一個筋疲力盡的活屍，如果我的運命早已是或者將要促進科學，如果我覺得我對於找四週的人的愛還有一些企望的影踪，如果在我俯視我孩子的墳墓的時候我的悲愁充滿了逆來順受而不知以爲苦的感覺，這是因爲這些力量在我的身上發生了作用，不是因爲我會注意着，究竟我這個可憐的人格將否永遠和「一切」同，那一切就是人格所以從來並且向之去的東西。</p>
<p>因此，我所親愛的金斯萊，你全明白我的地位是什麼吧。也許我很錯，如果這樣，我知道我就要爲了我的錯而受罰。不過我只能和路得（Luther）一樣地說「Gotthelfemi　Ich　Kann　nichtsanders。」　（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c80">聆楊寳森之「伍子胥」 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>月之四日，天蟾貼楊寳森之全部伍子胥，前面還有鄭冰如與班世超之金山寺，戲目之硬可　無出其右，乃驅車往觀焉。</p>
<p>班世超前似隨富連成來過上海，但彼時世超不過一班底子，充充三四路角色而已，不謂時隔不久，竟已唱倒第三。看他出手矯捷，對打緊凑，玩意兒的確有兩下。不過，嚴格地批評起來，還失之太「嫩」，比之從前常隸黃金的閻世善，似乎尚有一棋之差。</p>
<p>到祭塔上塲，白娘娘一角就換了冰如。此姝扮相，身段，唱工，都臻上乘，在坤角里面，的確可以坐第一把交椅。這並不是我故意捧冰如。諸位聽過冰如戲的，一定不以我言爲河漢。我尤其推崇她的，是她戲路之正。請看一看歷次南來唱紅了的坤旦，那一個不是靠幾齣紡棉花，貪歡報矇人的？哪一個眞講究什麼藝術來？縱然有幾個吸引力大的，充其量，不過花旦村料而已。眞靠唱腔，做派，站住脚跟的，近二三年來，似乎還只有一個鄭冰如。不錯，冰如的藝術比起許多老伶工來，還差得很遠，尤其是喜歡要花，愛用胡琴過門之間的閃板來博得淺薄者的鼓掌。但，就是要花，也要得比別人高雅。有味兒。這就是她的工夫。試聽她的吐音咬字，非久經琢磨者曷克臻此？尤其她沒有一般坤伶所共有的雌音，單這一點，就不容易。</p>
<p>戰樊城上塲已九時半。楊寳森以余派爲號召，唱來余腔余調，非常過癮。「兄長說話……」一節，嗓音嫌太低，但入後就愈唱愈甜了。寳森的嗓子就是這樣：耐用，持久，決不像俗伶那樣，唱到下半齣就聲嘶力竭。我又要捧一句：非有眞實功夫者曷　臻此？</p>
<p>全部伍子胥號稱包括十齣老戲，打個對折，至少五齣重頭戲是有的。戰樊城下來，伍申會平平而過，接著就是全劇薈萃所在的文昭關了，楊寳森換了箭衣上塲，幾句搖板，譚譚有味，値得喊一個「好」字。見東皋公後，「一言難盡」之叫板一起，馬上知道下面有好戲聽了，果然，「恨平王無道亂楚宮」一段快西皮，唱得字字振作，字字皆由丹田衝口而出。「一輪明月……」後接連有三大段，行腔吐字，令人過足戲癮。特別難能可貴的是第二句「愁人心中似箭穿」，寳森用哭音唱出，伍子胥過不了昭關，一種憂國懷家的心情，表現得淋漓盡致，中國老東西居然有這等細膩動人的地方，怎不叫人拍案叫絕呢？</p>
<p>浣紗溪與訪專諸兩折，演來也頗可觀。配角有林秋雯（有北方芙蓉草之雅號）劉硯亭等，可比綠葉之於牡丹，對全劇幫助頗多。但是，我最有好感的，還在下面的遇姬光一折。「伍子胥，伍明輔，父母的寃不能報」，下接哭頭「爹娘啊」，音極凄凉，和先前高朗激楚之聲自另有一番情致。時至街頭行乞，伍子胥的心情當然不能和先前一樣。</p>
<p>下面大軸，倒是王泉奎的戲。向裘盛戎墮落後，銅錘芷工人才，走遍大江南北，得推王泉奎一人獨步。聽完一段刺王僚，旁邊有人說：「簡直和金少山不相上下」。但是，我覺得，就藝術上說來，王要比金有出息得多。後者只靠嗓子衝賣錢，前者則不但嗓子衝，而且韻味十足。</p>
<p>綜觀天蟾此期角色，比起時下一般由野狐參禪者挑大樑，實不啻霄壤之別。惟一的缺點就是小丑和裏子人才是缺乏的。曹世嘉雖然能唱兩句，但以之飾空城計之王平，定軍山之嚴顏，究屬「差勁兒」。假使再加上李寳奎張榮奎十足「兌現」，那陣容就更加整齊了。</p>

<p>（二）</p>
<p>起初，他費了若干時間，才能懂得這一點。這並不是說，他是傲慢的，誇大的，這只是說，在他剛過二十歲的時候，也正和其他不少這樣年齡的靑年一般，抱有雄心。他原來的夢想是將來當一個校長，或者不論怎樣，總要在一個眞正第一等的學校裏當一個優級的敎師；經過了多次的嘗試和失敗，他才漸漸知道他不合於這些資格。例如他的程度並不十分好，他的紀律雖然好得很，也在進步着，却不見得在一切狀况之下都絕對靠得住。他沒有私人的財產，也沒有任何高親貴戚。大約在一八八〇年，他在勃洛克菲爾德十年之後，他才明白，假使他要遷移到別的地方去，因以改進自己，事實上是根難辦到的；不過也就在這時，一動不如一靜的念頭，才開始在他的心裏覺得了滿足。到了四十歲，他生了根，安定下來，十分快樂。在五十歲，他是敎職員會中的前輩先生。到了六十歲，在一個年輕的新校長之下，他就等於勃洛克菲爾德學校的化身——在勃洛克菲爾德的各種宴會中，他作貴賓，在有關勃洛克菲爾德歷史和傳統的一切事項上，他是上訴的法院。一九一三年，他六十五歲，他辭了職，接受了一張支票，一張寫字桌，和一具鐘，這些禮物，搬過大路，住到威葛特夫人的家裏去。澴算好的生涯，獲得了還算好的結束；在學期告終的熱鬧的宴會上，大家都爲老吉普斯三呼萬歲。</p>
<p>三呼萬歲，的確；不過後來的事情還有不少，想不到的收塲，在看悲劇的觀衆面前，又重新登塲了一次。（五）</p>

<p>次孫女毛毛，才五歲。日前下午，偶然在　門外遊戲，俄而我尋不見，知有異，及暮，仍不歸。急甚　，乃敲面盆底遍尋，仍不得，知被誘拐或做誘剝。正在料理報捕登報及貼招紙等等，舉室驚惶，莫知所措間，忽有二人送來，其中一人，將此孩裏在大衣襟懷抱之，出示名片，乃知爲上海特別市警察偵緝總隊劉鴻麟陸茂昌二先生也。余家流寓法租界薩坡賽路。此孩已被誘至南市，剝去棉衣絨褲，遺棄在荒凉處，孑然啼泣，二君遇而救之，不勝感謝。奉以薄酬，堅不肯受。且自謂此乃公務人員應盡之職務，誰無子女，寗忍漠視，故不憚煩難，速夜送歸云云。余對二君最所欽佩者兩點：其一，此孩尚不能說明自家之住址，又未見招貼及廣告，而偏能運用其神妙之偵探術，且肯在廣泛之範圍內挨段遍訪？居然得所，其機智及熱心，非常人所能及也。其二，在如此費心費力之餘，不受分文酬勞，且和藹可親，恕道足式，即其公正廉明之道德，尤非常人所能及也。孰謂世風澆漓之中，無獨特之善土乎？至於匪徒之狼心狗肺，離人骨肉，雖屬短時，亦足以使人凍傷凍死，或引起輾轉拐賣，父母急死等禍，其罪過實大。然旣圓顱方趾，同是人類，因窮而濫，自亦出於無奈。然寗作他種，甘脆之事，此事切不呆為，奉勸革面洗心，改邪歸正，否則怗惡不悛，必有惡貫滿盈，自作自受之一日，尤望一般有小孩者，格外注意，當心其爲小田雞也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Reforming the Political Climate <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's editorial discussed rectifying politics, offering suggestions from both fundamental and symptomatic perspectives. However, to realize rectified politics, it is necessary to first rectify and reform the prevailing political climate. As the Analects say, "To govern means to rectify. If you lead by being upright, who will dare not be upright? Ji Kangzi was worried about theft and asked Confucius. Confucius replied, 'If you yourself do not desire it, even if you reward them, they will not steal. When your person is upright, things will be done without orders. When your person is not upright, even if you order them, they will not follow.'" Mencius also said, "The spread of virtue is faster than the transmission of orders by post. In the present age, a nation of ten thousand chariots, if it practices benevolent governance, the people will rejoice, as if they were being rescued from being hung upside down." Now, as we revive the nation, genuinely cooperate with Japan, and shoulder the mission of the times, everyone knows that we must strengthen the power of the government. To strengthen the power of the government, we must first thoroughly reform the old practices that have accumulated in Chinese politics.</p>
<p>To reform the political climate, we must strengthen the political grassroots, which means strengthening the foundation of the government. What is the current state of the political grassroots? Some local bullies and bad gentry, hoodlums and gangsters, some relying on the prestige of the Japanese, some relying on their acquaintance with high-ranking officials, and some relying on the power of political parties, run rampant in their villages, disregard laws and regulations, bully the common people, and act selfishly. Frankly speaking, they have no understanding of the significance of their work. If such political grassroots are not quickly and thoroughly reformed, especially starting with the selection of lower-level political workers, even if you have very good policies and legal systems, it will only provide more tools and opportunities for local bullies and bad gentry to do evil.</p>
<p>Secondly, the characteristics of the old work style are: (1) On the part of the higher-level government, either there are too many laws and regulations, making it impossible for the lower-level government to implement them, or there are too many agencies issuing laws and regulations, often the same political order cannot be unified, leaving the lower-level government with nothing to follow. Either the various laws and regulations cannot fully suit the local conditions, making it difficult to promote them, or the higher-level government does not understand the true situation of the lower-level government and issues orders that the lower-level government cannot obey. Either the higher-level government fails to effectively supervise and assess the implementation of laws and regulations, or the variability of laws and regulations is too great, leaving those who implement them unable to keep up. (2) On the part of the county-level government, most of the institutions are unsound and unable to promote political orders, leading to perfunctory performance, and then to outwardly complying while inwardly opposing, and then to making false reports. Moreover, it is generally a yamen style, where each civil servant only knows to clock in and out for work, and does not care about the laws and regulations, the county administration, or the suffering of the people. Either there are too many superiors, often about a dozen agencies directly ordering the county government, making it impossible for the county government to cope, or the county magistrate holds too many concurrent positions, and has no time for rest, learning, thinking, planning, promoting, supervising, correcting, or assessing, except for reading official documents and attending meetings every day. The result of all this is that good political orders are shelved, and general political orders are used by petty people to harm the common people. Therefore, to reform the political climate today, it is even more necessary to focus on improving the relationship between governments at all levels.</p>
<p>However, to truly reform the political climate, it is also necessary to have new cadres, and to strive to cultivate and educate cadres, especially to promote new talents and inject new blood into governments at all levels. It is important to focus on understanding cadres, assigning them appropriate work, and allowing them to make the most of their strengths. It is important to "select the worthy and employ the capable," absorbing talents from all fields, without being bound by general parties, ideologies, and qualifications. The main thing is to "appoint the worthy and employ the capable," and not to "use people based on personal connections."</p>
<p>Most importantly, we will not talk about reforming the political climate otherwise. If we truly intend to reform the political climate, then the first thing to do is to achieve the principle stated by the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, "The people have rights, and the government has abilities." Because "politics is a matter for all people," the people are the subject of politics, which is what the ancients said, "The people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is solid, the state is well-governed." Therefore, the government is an agency that works for the people and should have abilities. However, since the people are the masters of the country, they must truly have rights. Only when the people's spirit is promoted can the country have a future. Only with the support of the people can the government's prestige and power be strengthened.</p>
<p>Reforming the political climate is the premise for rectifying politics, the premise for strengthening the government's strength, the premise for the total mobilization of the national spirit and material resources, and the premise for genuine cooperation between China and Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Reinforcements Arrive for Both Armies in Tunisia, Fierce Battle Unfolds, Axis Forces Maintain Strong Defenses in Mountainous Regions, Gibraltar Meeting Seeks to Break Deadlock <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Agence de Presse) - According to front-line reports from Tunisia, both the Axis and Allied forces have been continuously reinforcing their positions along the lines of Mateur and Medjez el Bab. Once the rainy season ends, a decisive battle appears imminent. However, since the 6th, the two armies have engaged in a fierce battle for a high ground located fifteen miles west of Mateur. Under the cover of paratroopers, the Allied forces have been gradually concentrating their forces around the high ground occupied by the Axis forces. In order to thwart this attempt by the enemy, the Axis forces launched a major offensive at dawn on the 6th. A Reuters dispatch from the 6th also acknowledged that the fighting was quite intense, stating that the Allied forces fought fiercely in this battle because they faced the most elite units of the German army on the Tunisian front.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berne, 6th - A dispatch from London states that British newspapers have carried reports from war correspondents in Tunisia, emphasizing the rugged terrain and the difficulty of combat in the region. The Axis forces have constructed strong defensive fortifications in the mountainous areas, making any potential conquest extremely difficult. Meanwhile, the British army has admitted to retreating in the Mateur area. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa announced in a war report today that British forces attacked German positions twenty miles west of Mateur, while the location of the fierce fighting several days ago was near the town. This suggests that the British army has retreated.</p>
<p>Agence de Presse, Lisbon, 7th - According to reports from the North African front, German air forces launched a large-scale bombing raid on Allied airfields and storage depots in the Aures Mountains on the 5th. Hangars and various military facilities were set ablaze. Simultaneously, they strafed Allied transport convoys. Italian air forces also bombed Allied rear bases at Bougie and Philippeville on the 6th. At the same time, the US air force appeared to be concentrating its efforts on bombing eastern Tunisia. Large formations of US Flying Fortresses attacked Sfax and Kal'at es Senam on the 6th, but were repelled by Axis air forces and heavy anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<p>Agence de Presse, Tokyo, 7th - According to the Asahi Shimbun, a dispatch from Rome reports that US Commander in North Africa, Eisenhower, and the British Ambassador to Spain, Hoare, met in Gibraltar on the 5th. According to sources in Tangier, it is believed that the meeting was convened by Britain and the United States to break the current deadlock on the Tunisian front. Discussions may have included supply issues, and even an agreement on new operations. Well-informed sources also believe that the meeting may have included concrete exchanges of views regarding plans to invade Spain, Crete, and Greece.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Tangier, 6th - The British aircraft carriers "Argus" and "Formidable," escorted by several destroyers, arrived in Gibraltar today from the Mediterranean. In addition, twenty-six British and American merchant ships are currently gathering in Algeciras, Spain.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Air Raids on Eastern India, Comprehensive Battle Results, Burma Organizes Volunteer Air Defense Teams <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Agence de Presse, Tokyo, 7th - In order to reverse their declining fortunes, Britain and the United States have frequently spoken of a general counter-offensive against Japan and are increasing their forces in East India in an attempt to attack Burma from the west and resume aerial guerrilla warfare. The Japanese garrison in Burma is well-prepared for this. Japanese army air units have repeatedly launched joint large-scale formations of fighter planes and bombers to bomb East India, destroying or shooting down as many as 128 enemy planes. According to a survey, the Anglo-American air force in all of India has 600 planes, of which about 200 are deployed in East India. Up to this month, the comprehensive battle results obtained by the Japanese army air units in December are as follows: (A) The comprehensive battle results of the Japanese army air units attacking East India and Yunnan-yi in December are: (1) East India: 34 shot down (8 unconfirmed), 25 enemy planes destroyed; (2) Yunnan-yi: 5 enemy planes shot down (2 unconfirmed), 13 enemy planes destroyed; (B) Damage to enemy planes flying into Burma: (1) 20 enemy planes shot down in air combat; (2) 31 enemy planes shot down by anti-aircraft fire; (C) More than 50 military facilities destroyed, and 26 enemy ships sunk or destroyed in Chittagong; (D) The Japanese army suffered losses of two planes, with seven planes failing to return; (E) The most active Japanese planes in Burma last month were the fierce bombings of Chittagong on the 5th and 10th, the continuous bombings of Chittagong and the Feni airfield on the 15th and 16th, and the first air raid on Calcutta and its surrounding areas on the 20th.</p>
<p>Agence de Presse, Rangoon, 7th - It has been disclosed that the people of Burma are quite indignant about the indiscriminate bombing of Burma by the enemy air force from India, and with the assistance of the Japanese military authorities, have begun to organize volunteer air defense teams. When a conference was recently held in the official residence of Burmese government head Ba Maw, a resolution proposed by Ba Maw's wife on Burmese women sharing the responsibility of defending Burma was passed. Ba Maw's wife declared at the conference that in view of the Japanese army's current determination to fight and not allow a single enemy soldier to invade Burma, it would be inappropriate for Burmese women to stand idly by. All Burmese men and women should do their best to assist in the war in order to achieve a victorious end. Various women's and youth organizations in Burma have immediately implemented this resolution and have organized rescue teams.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Minister Lin Broadcasts to Japan - How to Cooperate in the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Dear citizens of our friendly nation, on the 25th of last month, Chairman Wang, on the eve of his departure from Tokyo, said to you in a broadcast that this year is a year for your country to ensure the great results that it has continued to achieve since the Greater East Asia War, and also a year for your country to continue to win the Greater East Asia War and achieve its completion. Since last year, China's psychological construction and military-economic construction have all been focused on the point of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War. The colleagues of the National Government and the people they lead have united and are determined to cooperate with your country to share weal and woe, and share life and death. On the 21st of last month, when I met with your country's reporters, I also solemnly stated, based on Chairman Wang's instructions, that the National Government has recognized its due obligations and rights and responsibilities for the Greater East Asia War from the beginning. The statement of sharing weal and woe is by no means a mentality of luck and helplessness, and the desire to share the good times is only to share the bad times. It is to declare the position and determination of the two countries of China and Japan in relation to survival and security, and to awaken the national responsibility to hate the enemy together and to stand in the forefront of life and death at any time and place. We must face the second year of this Greater East Asia War with a more solemn attitude and more concrete actions, in order to share the obligations of the war. Now that we are in this bright new spring, we will take the most solemn attitude and the most tense spirit to launch further concrete actions to cooperate in the war. There are several things that can be told to you: First, on New Year's Day this year, Chairman Wang, based on the New National Movement Outline promulgated on New Year's Day last year, pointed out the focus of this year's efforts in light of the trend of the times, focusing on cooperating in the Greater East Asia War in the spirit of the New National Movement, and its minimum efforts are: First, to ensure public security and organize a line of East Asian comrades in the peaceful area, so that the running dogs instigated by Britain and the United States cannot invade all constructions in the peaceful area before they can start; Second, to increase production, the government must take the whole spirit to seek the strengthening of production organization, the improvement of production methods, the acquisition and utilization of production tools, and the people must also take the whole spirit to engage in the struggle. Second, the above basic policy will be implemented through the recently convened local chiefs' meeting, from the central government to the local level, and the whole country will work together to promote it. Third, the above basic policy will also be implemented through the recent plenary meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, so that all comrades of the party can clearly understand the needs of the situation, go deep into the masses to do leadership work, and do promotion work.</p>
<p>Fourth, the above basic policy will also be implemented through the recently convened New National Movement Promotion Association, and the general mobilization of the national spirit will be started. Regarding the organization and training of youth, the Central Youth Cadre School will be established on the 15th of this month. The preliminary organization and compilation of youth groups and scouts in various schools have been completed. The Chinese Youth Model Group has also begun preparations and will be established on a scheduled date. Regarding the re-training of civil servants, based on the spontaneous requirements of civil servants, the New National Movement Practice Group will be universally established. Regarding the training of industrious youth and the general public, the promotion meeting will also actively promote it.</p>
<p>Fifth, in addition, the judicial conference held on the 11th of this month, so as to seek the improvement of the current judicial situation and the establishment of the judicial system, is also so as to assist the maintenance of public security and the guarantee of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>In short, the National Government and the people it leads, having recognized that the responsibility of reviving China and defending East Asia is borne on their shoulders, and having recognized that cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is the only way to revive China and defend East Asia, will certainly promote the spirit of peace by going through all kinds of dangers and overcoming all kinds of difficulties and cooperate in the war. Peace is not passive or complacent peace. All peace that requires bloodshed, internal peace, and external war is the common mission of the East Asian nations. In order to complete the war of East Asian liberation, we must unite and end East Asian comrades under the moral peace and the peace of morality. In order to implement the morality of peace and to establish the moral peace, we must especially unite and end East Asian comrades, and use the total power of 1 billion East Asians to eliminate the enemies of East Asia and eliminate the traitors of East Asia. I would like to use this intention to wish our two countries and the East Asian axis countries to fight against foreign wars in order to obtain common life through common death, and to achieve common sweetness from common hardship for internal peace.</p>

<h3 id="e11">German Troops Change Tactics on Eastern Front, Construct Tiered Defense Line, Soviet Winter Offensive Fails, Fighting Intensifies in the South <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Agence de Presse, Berlin, 7th - The German High Command explained the winter encampment situation of German troops on the Eastern Front on the 6th, stating that the defensive tactics of German troops on the Eastern Front have been greatly changed. Last winter, the German army concentrated its main force in the rear, and the defense on the front line was extremely weak. This time, a strong tiered hedgehog-like defense line has been constructed, and a large number of weapons and ammunition have been prepared for winter warfare. This independent position can independently launch a defensive battle when the enemy breaks through the front line and invades. If the Soviet army invades the tiered position with a large force, it will not be able to take care of the rear troops to make contact. For example, on the 5th, the German troops guarding a certain position repelled the Soviet army's attack eight times and destroyed 35 of its tanks.</p>
<p>Agence de Presse, Stockholm, 7th - According to the Eastern Front news received here, the war situation in the southern part of the Eastern Front has become white-hot since the German army prepared for a counter-offensive posture. From Stalingrad to central Caucasus, the German and Soviet armies are engaged in a death struggle day and night. The war situation is like a tug-of-war. The Soviet army's operational goal in this area is Rostov, so the Soviet army is advancing westward along the Stalingrad-Rostov railway and the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway, and another part of the force is advancing northwestward from Nalchik-Prokhladny in central Caucasus, directly towards Rostov. At present, the German and Soviet armies are repeatedly fighting for strategic locations in the area near Morozovsk, 120 kilometers southwest of Stalingrad. The war report issued by the Soviet authorities on the 6th stated that the German army in this area has been reinforced by powerful tanks and infantry, and the counter-offensive force has been greatly enhanced. This is enough to imply that the Soviet army's offensive has not proceeded as desired. It is heard that the Soviet army, which is numerically superior in the Mostok-Prokhladny area of the Caucasus, seems to have adopted breakthrough tactics. Also, fierce fighting is currently taking place near Saltnoie, about 200 kilometers south of Stalingrad on the coast of the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Near the Soviet Border, 6th - Today's Soviet front-line battles were quiet in the central and northern sectors and active in the southern sector. The details are as follows: (1) There is nothing noteworthy in the Velikiye Luki area. The Red Army's offensive there has been frustrated and blocked by the strong fortifications built by the German army for the winter. (2) There is fierce fighting just south and southwest of Stalingrad. The Red Army admits that the German army has reinforced its troops in the area and on the Don River midstream front. The Red Army's war report stated that the Red Army continued to attack in the original direction, but did not mention place names. Observers here believe that after the German army occupies the Donets region, it can control the six major railway lines from west to east and concentrate in a certain important military strategic area. If the Red Army attacks along the Voronezh-Rostov railway, this area will be a hotly contested place. If the Red Army makes any progress in this direction, its flanks will be empty and will be attacked by the German army. (3) There is no major battle in the Novorossiysk area. The offensive launched several days ago seems to have become localized. (4) The war in the Caucasus region is very active. The two armies are fighting fiercely in the Terek region.</p>

<p>Havas Agency, Rome, 6th - According to news from North Africa, General Giraud, senior commissioner of the French breakaway faction, has flown to the Port of Dakar by special plane for inspection, escorted by 25 fighter planes. After disembarking, he immediately met with Boisson, the Governor-General of French West Africa. According to news from neutral countries, London is deeply surprised by General Giraud's sudden arrival in the Port of Dakar.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tangier, 7th - According to news from Dakar, the Dakar French reserve team mobilized in 1940 has been ordered to report by January 15. West African Governor-General Boisson has also called up French youths aged 20 to 21 to join the army.</p>
<p>Agence de Presse, Lisbon, 7th - It is said that former French President Lebrun recently arrived in Morocco. Giraud and Torgel are considering making Lebrun the Prime Minister of the North African French regime, with the former placed on the right wing and the latter placed on the left wing to assist him. However, this statement has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 7th - Responsible parties deny that former French President Lebrun is currently in North Africa. It is said that Lebrun has never left France and lives in Vizille, near Grenoble.</p>
<h3 id="e13">US Military Commander Reaffirms Respect for Spanish Neutrality <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Agence de Presse, Tokyo, 7th - According to the Asahi Shimbun's Rome dispatch, Patton, the US military commander in Morocco, suddenly flew to Spanish North Africa on the 5th and met with Governor-General Orgaz in the capital, Tetouan. He reiterated Roosevelt's guarantee made during the previous US invasion of French North Africa, that is, to respect Spain's political and territorial neutrality. According to news from Tangier, this kind of measure by the United States has given Spain a bad impression at a time when the situation is delicate. Although Spain recently suddenly announced that the Tangier National Defense Zone is a protected territory and mobilized troops to defend it, the British and American sides have remained silent without any reaction. Comparing these facts with each other, we can know that the situation is becoming more serious.</p>

<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Arrived from Macau on January 5th</p>
<p>Excerpts from a Journey to Xinjiang</p>
<p>Several Fragments of Personal Matters</p>
<p>October 20th, traveled from Lanzhou to Jiuquan. Took off from Lanzhou at 8:00 AM and arrived in Jiuquan at 11:00 AM. After disembarking, I heard that the yellow sandstorms ahead made flying impossible, so I was happy to stay here for a day. After dinner, I toured the city and saw that the streets were wide and already had a certain scale, unlike the desolate sight I saw when passing through in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938]. There was a newly arrived company of Yu troops passing through the center of the street. There were still many children without pants. The underdevelopment of water conservancy in the Northwest and the past governance that did not prioritize the people's livelihood were the main reasons for the poverty of the Northwest. I hope local officials will focus more on "poverty alleviation." I met Mr. Feng from the Customs, who was ordered to come here from Lanzhou last year to prepare for the establishment of a branch Customs. The tax revenue mainly comes from exports such as wool, leather, and medicinal materials. He has been here for less than a year, and what he feels most painful is the lack of spiritual food. Newspapers and publications do not arrive until a month later, and aviation flights are also uncertain. Mr. Feng said, "Serving in the Northwest slowly turns a person into someone deaf and blind. It's really scary." His words can represent the unanimous feeling of intellectuals serving in the Northwest.</p>
<p>October 21st, I got up at 6:00 AM and went to the airport to watch the morning sun. The sun rises from the foot of the Qilian Mountains, a fiery red ball, which is very beautiful. At 8:30 AM, I took off again and arrived in Hami at 11:00 AM. I stayed at the city's guesthouse and toured the suburbs after dinner. I had passed through Hami in the afternoon before and never had the opportunity to see the true face of Hami. This time, after walking in the suburbs for two hours, I realized that Hami is not the desert city I had imagined, but an oasis in the desert. The whole city is surrounded by streams, with willows planted everywhere on both banks, vegetables all over the ground, and crisscrossing fields. I heard that the stream water comes from the melting snow of the mountains dozens of miles away and is divided into several sections. Canals can be dug and water diverted anywhere to irrigate farmland. The cabbages produced here are three feet tall, which shows the excellent soil.</p>

<p>Vinos Elé, 7th, Allied Press Telegram: According to a telegram from Washington, President Roosevelt convened a Pacific military conference at the White House on the 6th. British Ambassador Halifax and the New Zealand Envoy attended, and a thorough review of the world war situation was conducted.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Havas News Agency Telegram: It is reported that since the arrival of American troops in the Middle East, the supply work in that area has been extremely difficult. British Minister of State for the Near East, Casey, went to Washington to discuss these difficulties with the American authorities. Casey has met with US Secretary of State Hull and also held a meeting with US Chief of Staff General Cole.</p>

<p>Bern, 6th, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to news from Washington, the US Congress convened its seventy-eighth session this afternoon. The number of senators and representatives present in the two houses is as follows: (1) Senate: 57 Democrats, 38 Republicans, and 1 Progressive; (2) House of Representatives: 222 Democrats, 201 Republicans, and 3 Progressives, with one vacancy. Representative Rayburn was re-elected as Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th, Huitong News Agency Telegram: It is learned here that the seventy-eighth US Congress opened in Washington yesterday. The new tax bill, which will further increase income tax and expand food rationing, is bound to cause fierce debate among members of Congress. Opinions on the organization of a wartime emergency cabinet proposed by Roosevelt differ greatly from Roosevelt's. Washington is recently rumored that Roosevelt will only recruit Vice President Wallace, Hopkins, and other officials into the cabinet. It is also said that some high-ranking military officers are expected to enter the cabinet. In addition, it is rumored in the US capital that a Four Giants Committee will be formed by Burns, Hopkins, Lee She, and Baruch.</p>
<p>Huge Budget Postponed for Discussion</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to a Washington telegram, the US$100 billion budget proposal, which was originally scheduled to begin on July 1st of this year, and was originally scheduled to be submitted to Congress for discussion on the 8th of this month, has now been decided to be postponed to the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Congressmen Criticize the Government</p>
<p>Vinos Elé, 7th, Allied Press Telegram: According to a telegram from Washington, the seventy-eighth US Congress opened on the afternoon of the 6th. Speaker of the House Rayburn first delivered a speech to Congress, calling this Congress a victory speech. However, dissatisfied members of the Republican and Democratic parties expressed strong opposition to the government's wartime policies such as agricultural policy and control of speech. It is expected that this Congress will go through considerable twists and turns, as Cox, the Democratic Representative elected from Georgia, delivered a speech on behalf of the Southern Congressional delegation after the Speaker's speech, attacking Roosevelt's dictatorial policies, mainly saying that the bureaucratic regime must be overthrown today. The parliament should use its fiscal decision-making power to accomplish this goal. The American people expect the laws that govern America to be enacted by the parliament organized by their elected representatives, but they have not seen this happen so far, and they have heard nothing about the government's policies. Even if they cannot expect the parliament elected by them to enact laws, they should also limit the power of the President. Therefore, we should uphold the independence of the parliament from the administrative organs. Our only task at present is to return the powers taken away by the government to the parliament, in order to establish a balance with the government. The implementation of this matter may be difficult, but if we continue to work hard, we will succeed. At the same time, the parliament should exercise the powers stipulated by the constitution, that is, the parliament must ensure the dominance of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th, Allied Press Telegram: It was revealed today that the Emperor of Japan summoned Aizawa, the Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, this afternoon and listened to his report on the administrative, economic, and cultural situation in Vietnam for 40 minutes. Aizawa left the palace and returned to his residence, where he met with the press and said that when he reported on the situation in Vietnam, he mentioned that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the attitude of the Vietnamese government and people has increasingly leaned towards Japan. In terms of economics, they have made every effort to cooperate with Japan, and in terms of culture, they have exchanged university teachers and students and learned Japanese, which is a clear proof of this. He also explained that Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam is working hard to deal with the extremely difficult and complex situation and maintain peace and tranquility with great skill. Although the situation in France is tense, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam has not changed in the slightest. Decoux has always firmly protected the Vichy government. It is expected that the economic agreement for this year, which is currently being negotiated by Japanese and French authorities in Saigon, will be concluded soon. It is reported that Aizawa arrived here on December 29th to discuss everything with the government authorities.</p>

<p>Washington Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e26">A Tour of Wartime Politics and Society in the United States – Sent on September 1st <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>When talking about wartime politics and society, of course, the wartime capital should be the center. Washington today is significantly different from before the war. The first impression is that there are many people. For those who want to come to Washington, the first thing to do is to book accommodation, otherwise they will suffer from not having a place to stay. The vacancies in hotels are not as spacious as they used to be, and friends' houses already have distinguished guests staying there. The world-famous White House has even broken the rule and received guests. The few quiet rooms that used to be there are now often occupied by international guests. It is not surprising that there are many people, but what is particularly striking is their distinct and diverse appearance. In terms of skin color, there are white, yellow, brown, gray, black, and other indescribable colors. If you look at their eyes, hair, clothing, and language, you don't know how many categories to divide them into. They come from this continent or tens of thousands of miles away. There is no doubt that they all occupy important positions in their respective societies.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking become noble with "accommodation." The supply of restaurants is no longer readily available: there are many people buying snacks from food stalls by the roadside to satisfy their hunger. This is not to say that they do not have money to pay for a feast, but that they want to save time. A few months ago, there was a short person buying peanuts in front of the White House. Judging by his clothes, he did not look like an American. Judging by his appearance, he looked quite like Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. After a few days, the newspaper announced that the customer of the peanut stall was indeed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.</p>
<p>The second impression is hurry. The best representative places are stations or stops for means of transportation. Anyone in this situation must temporarily abandon breathing, concentrate, seize the opportunity, and advance towards your goal, otherwise you will be glared at by your peers. Decorating the "hurry" space are eye-catching murals, warning people to do more work and talk less. In the paintings, a very beautiful person's mouth is sealed with a rubber band. It looks really unsightly, perhaps because Americans like to talk and deliberately promote this kind of thing. In short, talking has become an annoying thing in wartime mobilization.</p>
<p>There are many newly established institutions in Washington. If you have official business to discuss, it is best to find out their responsibilities in detail beforehand to avoid running into walls.</p>
<p>When Congress is in session, it is even more lively than before. Now you often hear a warning in the meeting place, "Only discuss things, not people." It is said that this sentence was invented by Roosevelt for the needs of the situation, and it is also one of his most effective tools for promoting unity and advancing government affairs.

Changes in foreign policy must have the cooperation of the parliament, so it is expected that the final decision will still take some time.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Concrete Preparations for Per Capita Rationing; Oilseed Raw Materials Arrive; Oil Merchants' Advance Payment Method Still Under Negotiation; Sugar Rationing May Be Increased During the Lunar New Year <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Group B oil shops in this city, after paying for and receiving the goods the day before yesterday, have continued to retail them starting yesterday (the 7th) and are scheduled to sell them out by the 10th. As for the implementation of a large-scale per capita oil distribution system, the system and its implementation methods are currently being discussed by the Edible Oil Industry Association Wholesale Office and the concession authorities. Once the plan is completed, it will be announced and implemented. According to reporters from the Central News Agency, who inquired with retailers yesterday, the most serious problem with per capita oil distribution is the retailer's advance payment. According to the method of the Industry Association Wholesale Office, the retail oil shops must first pay a deposit, which is calculated at 30 piculs each time, which also requires more than 60,000 yuan. This amount is very large, and retailers are unable to bear it. The two sides are currently in consultation, and the per capita oil distribution can be implemented only after this problem is resolved.</p>
<p>Soybeans and Sesame Seeds Arrive</p>
<p>Recently, a large amount of soybeans from Dalian has arrived in Shanghai and will be distributed to four oil extraction factories south of the Suzhou River, including the Japanese-owned Risen and Kawaminami. The purpose of this is to provide raw materials for oil extraction, so the above four factories will resume oil extraction work in mid-month. The oil produced will be distributed to the Edible Oil Industry Association Wholesale Office to maintain the legitimate needs of the Shanghai market. Yesterday, another 4,000 tons of soybeans and 2,000 tons of sesame seeds arrived, along with a large batch of commissioned sugar. The panic over the shortage of sugar and oil in this city may disappear.</p>
<p>Entrusting Oil Factories to Process Oil</p>
<p>The Japanese military authorities have entrusted the China Central Oil Association to process these beans. Six of the oil factories are designated to produce sesame oil, while another six oil factories are entrusted to process soybeans and produce soybean oil. These oil factories are expected to start producing oil soon, and the new oil will be available for sale in the market.</p>
<p>Commissioned Sugar Is on the Way</p>
<p>The expected commissioned sugar, under the arrangement of the Japanese military authorities, is in transit. Its quantity will increase the sugar reserves in this city to 150,000 bags. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has reportedly announced that it will increase its January allocation from 30,000 bags to 50,000 bags to supply the needs of the Chinese Lunar New Year. At the same time, according to well-informed sources, a large amount of sugar can arrive continuously, expressing confidence that the sale of sugar will no longer be restricted, but will be limited to the amount needed per person. The improved situation of sugar is already visible. Under the temporary per capita rationing plan in the French Concession, each foreigner could obtain two pounds of sugar last time. As for whether each foreigner can buy three pounds of sugar in this period, it is still being rationed. It is reported that the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office will thoroughly reform the distribution method in the short term to facilitate purchase and eliminate crowded lines.</p>

<p>Allied Press, This City News: According to observers, people in this city expect that the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office will convene a conference of consuls from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui on January 11 to discuss the decisive war system, which will further enhance Sino-Japanese cooperation this year.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Relations Enter a New Stage</p>
<p>During the meeting, Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy presided over the discussion of various methods to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation in order to cope with the current situation and presented various plans discussed by the Japanese government's policy toward China during his recent visit to Japan. Then, the consuls-general stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai and the consuls stationed in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Bengbu, and Xuzhou will report on the current situation in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Embassy Office. Observers believe that the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry by Japan, the departure of Ambassador Shigemitsu to Tokyo, and the recent meetings of Japanese ministers, consuls-general, and consuls stationed in China are all part of Japan's policy of enhancing Sino-Japanese friendship. After the reorganization of Japanese government offices in China, Sino-Japanese relations are expected to enter a new stage.</p>
<p>Future Steps, About Six Items</p>
<p>And the steps that Japan will take in the future are expected by observers as follows: (1) Strengthen the Sino-Japanese cooperation system; (2) Promote the strength of the central and provincial government offices of the National Government; (3) Japan will cooperate with the National Government to enhance peace and tranquility and assist in the village clearing movement; (4) Japan will continue to assist the National Government's unified currency policy, strengthen the economic relations between the two countries, and promote the smooth exchange of goods between Japan, China, and Manchuria, as well as between North China, Central China, and South China; (5) Strengthen education and cultural activities in accordance with the National Government's New National Movement; (6) Implement various measures to stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Money Shops' Interbank Lending Transferred to the Money Treasury <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Money Industry Joint Reserve Treasury has recently reached an agreement with the Banking Joint Reserve Committee on the adjustment of funds for member money shops and the handling of interbank lending matters. Starting from January 5 this year, the member money shop part will be transferred from the Banking Joint Reserve Committee to the Money Treasury. From now on, (1) the Banking Joint Reserve Committee will specialize in interbank lending for member banks; (2) interbank lending for money shops will be handled by the Money Treasury. The deposits and debts of each money shop that used to be with the Banking Joint Reserve Committee have been completely settled by the end of last December. The Banking Joint Reserve Committee's disbursement orders opened by each money shop will be transferred by the Money Treasury. This newspaper's reporter learned from the money industry yesterday that the Money Industry Reserve Treasury will handle interbank lending for member shops in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Banking Joint Reserve Committee, that is, each shop can provide property to apply for interbank loans, but it is limited to the needs of normal business: (1) government securities; (2) stocks and bonds of commercial companies; (3) profitable real estate within the Shanghai Concession; (4) goods that can be sold immediately in this city (but limited to the goods owned by the owner and not for hoarding for profit, the total value of the goods provided by each money shop shall not exceed 25% of the total amount of interbank lending approved for each shop). The selection and evaluation of interbank lending collateral are particularly cautious, and it is stipulated that discounts and loans will be given according to the assessed price. The interbank lending period is ten days, but it can be repaid in advance. The interbank lending rate will be announced monthly and has been notified by the Money Industry Reserve Treasury to the member shops for compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Police Department Investigates the Black Market; Decisive Action Will Be Taken; Eliminating Illegal Activities Is Only a Matter of Time; Speculation in Cotton Cloth Will Be Thoroughly Investigated <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources yesterday, the police investigation of the black market in this city revealed that some buyers purchase goods for the purpose of speculation, and that only a small portion of the goods in the current normal market are real.</p>
<p>Shipments Arrive; Distributed to the Black Market</p>
<p>According to another opposite attitude, it is believed that recently, a large number of shipments have arrived and been distributed to the black market, but the general legitimate consumption has not been applied, especially canned food and imported cigarettes. In any case, the cotton cloth market is still in progress even after the brokers have been arrested by the police. The authorities have decided to suppress speculation, as the authorities know that most brokers and speculators are engaged in large-scale activities according to the above-mentioned methods.</p>
<p>Cannot Be Stopped Unless Sanctioned</p>
<p>According to a member of the Police Department who told a reporter from the Times, the Police Department is still cooperating with the Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Office to continue investigating black market activities, and the situation is quite obvious in yesterday's report. Illegal market activities can be eliminated in the short term by the decisive action of the authorities. However, the investigation of the 364 cotton cloth brokers arrested in the Public Concession last month will be implemented. It is said that the authorities will not stop the action until it is proven that these people are sanctioned to clear the case.</p>
<p>Speculative Undertakings; Strictly Cracking Down</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the existing situation has shown signs of improvement, said the member, adding criticism. Almost every item has been reduced and fixed, and the black market has no way to develop. Those engaged in activities have felt difficulty. Once the cotton cloth black market activities stop, the complete elimination of all other illegal activities is only a matter of time. The Police Department official also said that the police are now strictly cracking down on speculation in the cotton cloth market. Although the investigation work is a bit slow, the authorities have to do so in order to take the final step and avoid any obstacles.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department recently made an important statement to reporters, saying that since its reorganization, the Public Concession Police has been fully committed to maintaining public security and order within the Concession, with remarkable results. In terms of internal organization, it is now approaching the form of the Japanese police organization and will be the best police force in the history of the Concession. Currently, the police department plans to implement some necessary changes gradually. In terms of personnel, although there are no immediate changes, it will fully prepare to train cadre personnel to take on important positions within the police department and various district police stations. One hundred and fifty individuals are about to be assigned official duties. These individuals were selected in Japan during the Chief Inspector's last trip to Japan, with some coming from Manchukuo, Beiping, and Tianjin. In any case, the public concession police organization will continue to strengthen and improve at any time to fulfill the mission of safeguarding public security and ensuring the stability of the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Spokesman for the Japanese Army Makes a Statement <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The spokesman for the Japanese military reported this afternoon (7th) at 2:00 PM, during a reception for Chinese and Japanese reporters, announced the destruction of the US-Chongqing air force and the dream of indiscriminate bombing of the peace zone. According to the Japanese spokesman, since the Chongqing aviation base retreated to Kunming, the US aviation commander stationed in Chongqing had a plan to indiscriminately bomb cities in the peaceful areas. However, this organized plan was ultimately severely damaged by the Japanese air force and declared a failure.</p>
<p>Major Blow</p>
<p>The spokesman continued that the Chongqing side's behavior was merely a bluff and they would definitely not dare to try bombing the peace zone on their own. Their initial efforts to attack and spy on Burma and Vietnam were enough to prove that they had no ability to attack the peace zone. When invading Vietnam and Burma, it was only a guerrilla warfare by the air force. From this, the weakness of the Chongqing air force can be seen. According to intelligence from the Japanese air force, after the US air force base was moved to Kunming, it was given a major blow and then wiped out. The US aviation unit stationed in Chongqing was originally planned to have five squadrons. However, due to the difficulty of the US transport route to Chongqing, which was blocked by Japan, the current stationed troops only have three squadrons. Moreover, each squadron has no more than five people. Now, after being severely attacked by the Japanese army, the losses were heavy. One of these three squadrons has been wiped out, and another squadron has been reduced by more than half. Therefore, the strength of the Chongqing-US air force has been reduced, which can be seen by all.</p>
<p>Chongqing-US Friction</p>
<p>As the Chongqing air force currently has difficulty in launching an offensive into the peace zone, and the climate is unfavorable in January and February, making it difficult for the air force to operate, we are optimistic and also strictly vigilant. Because when the climate improves, the Chongqing-US air force may use guerrilla tactics to carry out surprise attacks, which can be anticipated. Furthermore, according to an investigation of the Chongqing air force's current strength, after the US supplemented it with ten aircraft last December, it now has only ninety aircraft. Although Chongqing hopes for large-scale US aid, it is difficult for the US to find ways to transport it due to long-distance transportation difficulties. Later, it was mentioned that Chongqing had declared a plan to jointly attack the peace zone with the US. Subsequently, discord grew between Chongqing and the US, and the struggle was fierce. Since the Chongqing Aviation Minister Mao Bangchu and the US Commander-in-Chief in China disagreed, the plan collapsed. This is the biggest reason for its failure and a characteristic manifestation of the Chongqing-US friction.</p>
<p>Crude Equipment</p>
<p>As the Chongqing-US air forces cannot cooperate, the Japanese air force takes advantage of their weaknesses to attack the Chongqing-US bases in Kunming, thus achieving remarkable results repeatedly. At the same time, Chongqing's air defense equipment is extremely crude, especially the civilian air defense equipment, which is even worse. Once the Japanese army goes to bomb it, it cannot be resisted. The Japanese spokesman finally said that Chongqing's regular army does not have appropriate equipment. For example, during the Dabie Mountains battle, no air force assistance from Chongqing was seen. Therefore, its combat capability is quite weak. Recently, Chongqing officials broadcasted that the Japanese army bombed Ganzhou, Jiangxi, and other places on New Year's Day, and the site of the Political Daily newspaper was completely destroyed and could not be published, so it was jointly published on the 1st and 2nd. From this, it can be seen that Chongqing's bottomless road to resistance is running out.</p>

<p>The Allied News Agency Shanghai dispatch reports that the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily News" published this morning (7th) that the China Inland River Shipping Company will open a new shipping route on the Huangpu River from tomorrow, connecting Shanghai and Huzhou. Ships will sail every other day from No. 37 Bund, passing through Lili and Pingwang towns to Huzhou, which is 70 kilometers shorter than the previous route taking the Suzhou Creek through Suzhou, and the voyage time will also be reduced from three days to two days. It is understood that this new route was opened due to the success of the clearing and suppression movement in the Shanghai area and the southeastern area of Taihu Lake. Previously, the loyal patriotic army of Chongqing was active between Shanghai and Pinghu.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Small Newspapers in This City Will Be Merged and Published Soon <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, it has felt that there are too many small newspapers in this city, and it is particularly necessary to reorganize them. Especially in order to adapt to the supply and demand of wartime materials, it is not appropriate to waste paper. After careful consideration, it was decided to adjust the method and submit it to the Propaganda Department for approval. The office convened a meeting of responsible persons from various small newspapers on the 5th of this month. As a result, everyone unanimously supported the government's decision and will be merged separately in the near future. From then on, the lineup of small newspapers in this city will be brand new and the steps will be orderly. According to Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, he was approved by the Propaganda Department to thoroughly implement it. He deeply understands the difficulty of creating newspapers, so he will only try to merge them as much as possible and try to improve them, and will not allow any existing small newspapers to be eliminated.</p>

<p>There are more than 540 cooked water shops in the two concessions of this city. The sizes of the ladles they use vary, which are inconsistent. The authorities concerned believe that the different sizes of ladles used by the industry will inevitably cause additional problems. In order to unify the capacity, they have ordered the industry association to adjust the ladles used by the industry within a time limit, and ordered the ladles currently in use to be submitted for inspection and verification for use. After the industry association received the order yesterday, it has acted accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Cold Weather: Rice and Porridge Distribution in the City <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Nanshi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Porridge Distribution Factory, located at the Guandi Temple on Zhaojia Road in Nanshi, has greatly benefited the poor since its establishment. The porridge distribution certificates issued have reached more than 3,000, distributed throughout the Nanshi area, limited to 600 people per neighborhood. The neighborhood chiefs issue letters of certification or guarantee. Originally, the porridge eating time was from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM every day. The poor can enter the factory with certificates to eat porridge. However, recently, in view of the severe cold weather and the thin clothing of the poor, which cannot protect them from the cold in the early morning, the porridge distribution time has been changed again from yesterday to 8:30 AM to 9:00 AM every day. For the elderly and disabled, their families can bring the certificate to collect porridge on their behalf. As for the porridge currently distributed, due to the problem of rice, it is thickened with sweet potatoes to maintain it for a long time.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The Western Shanghai area is vast and the poor are densely populated. At this time of winter, it is extremely cold, and the hidden poor are suffering from hunger and cold. Those who fall to the side of the road in the morning are numerous. What one hears and sees is extremely miserable. Therefore, Bu Lifu, the director of the Western Shanghai District Office, and others initiated the establishment of the Western Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, which was announced in the latter half of last month. Under the principle of not conflicting with the Winter Relief Association sponsored by the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau, it is actively promoting winter relief work. It is learned that in order to promote the association's affairs, the executive committee was established by the general meeting the day before yesterday (6th). Before the porridge distribution can be realized, it was decided to distribute rice first from next week, sending it every other day. Each person can get five he of rice (two and a half he a day), with a quota of 1,000 people.</p>

Except for rice merchants in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Western Shanghai, who directly apply to the Food Administration Bureau, the other ten districts are responsible for handling the registration procedures by the representatives of the rice industry associations in each district. Rice merchants and branch representatives in each district should go to the Food Administration Bureau to collect the registration regulations five days before the prescribed date in order to start. It is understood that the registration regulations stipulate that rice merchants will not be allowed to operate without applying for registration and obtaining a registration certificate.</p>

In order to expand the purpose of regulating finance and to restore the original state of business before the incident, in addition to the simultaneous resumption of business of the branch offices in Mubut on September 1st of last year, after sending personnel to investigate the situation in various locations in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions and actively arranging them, the China Communications Bank has now decided to first restore the business of the branches and offices in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places this month. It is reported that the candidates for the directors have been internally determined, and the resumption date will be announced in the near future.</p>

<p>Second Division: Trade</p>
<p>The second division in the afternoon was chaired by Mr. Nango Saburo, President of the Trade Control Association. First, Mr. Sugimura Hirozo (Director of the Trade Control Association) gave a constructive opinion from a general point of view on "Trade Countermeasures Based on the Ideal of the Greater East Asia Economic Construction." Subsequently, representatives from Japan, Manchuria, and Mongolia reported one after another. The opinions of each representative were roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Sugimura Hirozo—Japan</p>
<p>When relocating daily necessities industries and miscellaneous industries to foreign countries, it is necessary to consider their impact on the Japanese economy and study the most appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>Motomura Masamichi—Manchuria</p>
<p>(1) The materials necessary for the expansion of Manchuria's productivity are mostly obtained from Japan. Therefore, within the limits planned for supply to Manchuria, we hope that materials will be sent to Manchuria as quickly and reliably as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Furthermore, in terms of trade, since the main point lies in the relationship with Japan, changes in Japan's institutional system all have a great impact on Manchuria. Therefore, on the Manchurian side, it is necessary to echo Japan and study the most appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>Jiang Zuoxuan—Central China</p>
<p>(1) In order to eliminate obstacles to the exchange of materials in Central China, on the one hand, it is necessary to urgently improve the distribution mechanism. At the same time, efforts must be made to strengthen the connection between Chinese and Japanese colleagues in order to improve distribution.</p>
<p>(2) To the extent possible, we hope to ease the restrictions on various regions in the peaceful area in order to lower prices.</p>
<p>Munakata Takeo—Mengjiang</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensively review supply and demand, deepen the mutual dependence system, and thoroughly break the fragmentation doctrine.</p>
<p>(2) With Japan as the center, adjust exchange rate policies, price policies, etc. in a unified manner so that difficulties due to the uneven distribution of materials in various regions can be easily solved.</p>
<p>(3) Increasing transportation capacity is the most necessary. Therefore, fuels, etc. for material handling must be eliminated from all difficulties and quickly distributed.</p>
<p>Iwaishi Yujiro—Japan</p>
<p>Under the current situation, it is quite difficult to increase trade. As a last resort, we hope to transplant some of Japan's industrial equipment to foreign countries.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Works Department, the French Concession Public Works Bureau, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government have implemented the maximum price limit for yarn and cloth since December 1st of last year. After the effective implementation, due to the Ministry of Finance's announcement that the unified tax on cotton yarn has been implemented since the 1st of this month, changed to ad valorem collection of 5%, the current maximum price of yarn and cloth must be adjusted again due to the increase in the unified tax on yarn and cloth.

<p>Money Market Not Yet Relaxed, Cash May Be Difficult to Turn Around</p>
<p>In order to protect the interests of depositors, the silver and money industry banks and zhuang have paid the deposit reserve fund to the Central Reserve Bank in accordance with the temporary regulations on the management of financial institutions. The reserve funds for fixed deposits and special current deposits have been paid more than 5% in compliance with the order. According to regulations, the reserve fund for current deposits is more than 10%. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office, in view of the fact that although the Shanghai financial market has stabilized after the general conclusion of disaster relief, the money market is still tight, and the banks and zhuang handled the final accounts at the end of last year, all settled with a stroke of the head. The lack of cash will be before the end of the old lunar year, so there is no hope for the axle machine. Therefore, in order to take care of the banks and zhuang, they are allowed to postpone the current deposit reserve fund payable until February 4, after the total conclusion period of each industry, and then pay it.</p>
<h3 id="e54">French Concession Phase II Air Defense General Report <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>French Concession Elimination Disaster Prevention Phase II General Report (April 14 to 23, 1942)</p>
<p>General Observation</p>
<p>The warning alarm in the second phase was very long, which is different from the situation in the first phase of the exercise (i.e., October 1 to 10, 1942). For example, the warning alarm that started at 6:00 PM on Sunday, December 20, was not lifted until 8:00 PM on Wednesday, December 23. During this long-term warning alarm, the police station and the civil police corps worked hard for a long time. Because many residents forgot the existence of the warning alarm at sunset or sunrise and did not cover the curtains, and turned on the lights first, but the personnel of this police station did not encounter any difficulties in this situation. Because residents have become accustomed to the general rules of passive air defense, especially the implementation of the regulations on light control. Therefore, the work of the police station was assisted by the Baojia personnel, and the result was very satisfactory. The Baojia personnel in each district are enthusiastic and loyal in their work.</p>
<p>Special Observation</p>
<p>On December 14, the warning alarm started six hours before sunset. Many households and shops turned on the lights at sunset without paying attention. Fortunately, under the intervention of the police station personnel and the civil police corps serving on the road, most of them covered the lights within 30 seconds. During the air raid alarm, the light coverage in large apartment buildings was better than in the October exercise. During the October exercise, public vehicles did not have lights equipped. But now, when parking, there is a very clear light. The light coverage equipment for vehicles pulled and pushed by manpower is generally not complete, and the lights are only turned off during the alarm time. In this phase, many pedestrians did not know the need to walk on the left side of the sidewalk, and those riding bicycles still did not get off the bicycles during the air raid alarm, so they were corrected. In short, the results on the first day were generally satisfactory.</p>
<p>December 15, the first air raid alarm (9:20 to 11:00) This was the first air raid alarm in the city. All public and private vehicles stopped running, but difficulties occurred. People on the road did not know what measures to take.</p>
<p>December 17, the warning alarm was from 9:00 to 0:00, and the air raid alarm was once from 10:00 to 11:00, once from 14:00 to 15:00, and once from 20:00 to 21:30. The light coverage at sunset has greatly improved, but there are still not a few residents who do not pay attention. Therefore, those who are more famous and noteworthy have been punished. When the second air raid alarm was issued during the day, the results were quite satisfactory, especially the pedestrians who could abide by the discipline, which is worth mentioning. Vehicles also had no irregularities.</p>
<p>December 19, the warning alarm issued at 18:00 (street lights remain open) was not lifted until 6:00 AM on the 20th. The results on this day were as good as the previous day, but a few residents did not know that the street lights were not turned off during the warning, and they had to wait for the notification from the police and the self-defense corps members before they completely covered the lights.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>According to this rescue and light coverage exercise, there has been great progress in the area of civil servants, and residents have also made progress in abiding by discipline, because they know that the maintenance of public interest depends on private efforts. The sincerity of the public, the efforts of the Baojia personnel in this concession, and the enthusiasm and dedication of the fire brigade's sanitation department and nursing staff are especially commendable. In addition, in the two most difficult exercises, it proved that the negative defense agencies and the Wei Ci Hospital, which served as the rescue headquarters, will be able to do their best in the event of an air raid in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e55">City-Wide Comprehensive Report <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Police Department recently released the third comprehensive record report of civilian air defense training, saying: (1) Supplementary equipment. It was found that the reasons for the failure to be thorough in the first and second civilian air defense training were mostly due to inattention to skylights and light reflection, and the poor were difficult to purchase door curtains, window curtains, and air defense lampshades due to economic reasons, or because there were no electric lights in the houses, oil lamps and candles could not be equipped with lampshades, resulting in defects in the results. In view of this, after the second exercise, the Bureau ordered the sub-bureaus to instruct the Baojia to correct and supplement them separately, so this exercise was more complete than before. (2) Sound control. During the first and second exercises, the various sounds were not taken into account, so the use of horns and bells by all vehicles was not completely banned. Even the air defense communication liaison, in order to spread the word, used bronze gongs prepared by the neighborhoods to transmit each other. This kind of sound has a major relationship in air defense. Except for the broadcasting station, which is banned by the Japanese Army and Navy Command, all other sounds are completely prohibited. (3) Communication liaison. The air defense communication liaison in this city, in order to be rapid and universal, is equipped with bronze gongs by each neighborhood office. When a police report is received, it is sent separately. This time, due to sound control, it is inconvenient to use bronze gongs. It is stipulated that each Jia should designate a household with a radio to receive the Greater East Asia Broadcasting (636 cycles). Once the alarm is received, the Jia chief will inform the households in the Jia under its jurisdiction. In this way, there is no sound and it is faster than before. (4) Squad lookout. It was found that in the previous exercises, the Bureau and the sub-bureaus each had two or three lookout posts, but the previous exercises were mostly after 6:00 PM, so the police officers stationed at the lookout posts were also mostly in the afternoon. This time, the training time is uncertain, so the police officers sent to the lookout posts are long-term, day and night, rotating duty, in order to detect alarms, view signals, and look out for fire.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Chinese Merchant Stocks Still in a Declining Trend <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese merchant stock market continued its sluggish performance, but the decline was not as severe as in previous days. This was mainly because the prices of older stocks had fallen too much in recent days, leading to more active buying from investors. According to industry insiders, there is unlikely to be a turnaround within the next week. Changes are expected around the 15th of this month, as it is rumored that the monetary situation may ease after being maintained. Among the department stores, Sincere Company stood out, rising from 135 yuan to 138.5 yuan, a gain of 2.5 yuan. National Goods Company rose from 72.5 yuan back to 75.4 yuan, still down 2 yuan. Wing On was stable around 127 yuan, down 0.5 yuan. The textile industry was relatively stable, with Wing On Textile Mill down 5 yuan to 355 yuan. Both Hung Sheng and Great China Weaving were within 9 yuan. Rong Feng Dyeing and Weaving attracted little attention. Great China Match Factory fell slightly to 345 yuan, down 10 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco rose from 120 yuan back to 122 yuan, still down 1 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Min Yi continued to fall after entering the 65 yuan premium range, dropping further to 61.2 yuan. New Asia stabilized around 25.5 yuan. Sino-French (26.75 yuan), Sino-Western (440 yuan), and Jiu Fu (425 yuan) were all stable. Xinyi fell by 2.5 yuan to 257.5 yuan at noon. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity entered the 60 yuan range, down 1 yuan. China Merchant Electric broke the 40 yuan mark, down 0.5 yuan. In the cultural industry, World Book Company fell to 102.5 yuan, but news of the imminent return of the factory site triggered buying activity, causing it to rebound. China was still at 160 yuan. Commercial Press was down 5 yuan, trading at 440 yuan. Kang Yuan Canning fluctuated between 50 yuan and 51 yuan. In the financial sector, Zhejiang Xingye at 700 yuan and Shanghai Bank at 650 yuan both attracted buyers. The China Merchant Securities Exchange stock, a generally neglected stock, stood out due to favorable rumors, with no sellers at 110 yuan. The rest were also weak, with few transactions. The table is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Public Bond Market Depressed <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The public bond market is becoming increasingly depressed. The market has essentially disappeared, and even temporary gatherings are becoming increasingly rare. Only occasional inquiries are made, and most are for selling. The gloom in the bond market is evident here. Yesterday, there was some trading in Type C bonds, falling from over 2 yuan to 1.3 yuan, and finally at 1.45 yuan. Type A was within 1 yuan, and there were no transactions in Type B. Type D was only a few cents, but Type E was only a few cents as well. The market price is weakening daily, indicating tight credit conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Ornament Gold Internal Trading Falls; Listed Price Unchanged <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the listed price for ornament gold in Shanghai's jewelry stores remained unchanged at 3,050 yuan per tael (purchases were less than 300 yuan). Inter-dealer trading prices initially rose, then suddenly fell back to the 2,900 yuan level, due to some dealers selling high. The morning price was 2,930 yuan, down 25 yuan. It then rallied to 2,980 yuan amidst buying pressure. Some dealers sold high, and soon the price began to fall, dropping 90 yuan to 2,890 yuan. The situation stabilized at noon, with a noon price of 2,910 yuan, down 45 yuan from the previous day, with a daily range of 90 yuan. Transaction volume was light. The listed price for ornament silver remained at 16 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer trading prices at 16.8 yuan and 17 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association's overnight interest rate remained unchanged at 17%.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Military Notes Stable; Joint Notes Down Another 5 Cents <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, military notes were stable, with inter-dealer trading prices at 5.55 yuan and 5.552 yuan. Small money shops and banks quoted buying and selling prices at 5.545 yuan and 5.55 yuan. Joint bank notes fell another 5 cents, with dealers selling at 3.75 yuan and buying at 3.70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Sherling Cloth Rises Sharply <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market was even more deserted yesterday morning, and prices changed little. Four Gentlemen poplin ranged from 8.60 yuan to 8.67 yuan, remaining at 8.60 yuan at noon, down 6 cents from the previous day. Colored cloth Peach Blossom Sherling Factory single 359 yuan, Chick Sherling Factory single 358 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Grass Green Serge Expensive; Overcoat Cloth and Long-Haired Wool Decline Sharply <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Grass green serge and wool fabrics, such as gabardine and riding breeches cloth, have been in tight supply recently. Demand from domestic customers is high, and sales are very strong. Dealers' inventories are extremely tight. On the one hand, factory production has been hampered by a shortage of grass green dyes and, on the other hand, by the difficulty in obtaining fine wool raw materials, resulting in very high prices. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson quoted 340 yuan per pound for 1 to 28 grass green riding breeches cloth, 240 yuan for Yinfeng grass green gabardine, 200 yuan for Dalong, 158 yuan for Yangcheng brand grass green serge, and 180 yuan for Caishen Tiger.</p>
<p>Apart from high-end goods, overcoat cloth has generally declined in price and sales due to the end of the season. The market has more sellers than buyers, leading to price declines. Even discounts of about 10 yuan per yard have failed to attract buyers. High-class ladies dislike long-haired wool because there are too many inferior imitations on the market. They prefer to have leather coats made instead. As a result, except for top-quality goods priced at 200 yuan per yard, sales of long-haired wool have declined daily. The use of horsehair satin is also declining as the overcoat season is more than three-quarters over. General first-tier customers in the Western clothing industry adhere to the principle of buying only what they sell, causing prices to stagnate and decline, creating a sense of a river flowing downhill.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Sugar Rationing Confirmed at 50,000 Bags This Month <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Rumors circulated outside that the sugar ration for this month would be 40,000 bags or 45,000 bags. However, this newspaper had previously reported that it would include an additional 15,000 bags and the original 30,000 bags. In addition, there is a special allocation of 5,000 bags to meet the needs of vendors. Vendors should apply to the cooperative for vouchers, which can be used to purchase sugar from designated stores. According to a certain sales supervisor, this increase has already been decided.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Golden Vegetables Still Upside Down <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Golden vegetables are experiencing limited sales in Shanghai, leading to a soft trend. However, production costs remain firm. According to merchants from Xuzhou, recent procurement prices for shipments to Shanghai require at least 630-40 yuan. However, the opening price here for higher-quality goods is also around 600 yuan, which will be reduced, while particularly high-quality goods will be increased. Therefore, the situation remains upside down.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Officially Arrived Longan Samples Available Today <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The latest shipment of Quanzhou longan has officially arrived and most have been transferred to warehouses. Samples will be available today. However, as these goods were purchased at high prices, the cost is high. Based on current market prices, losses are inevitable. Therefore, it seems difficult to have a good opening price today.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Northern Goods Sales Sluggish and Prices Weak <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Northern goods are experiencing sluggish sales due to tight credit conditions, leading to a soft market.</p>
<p>(Black Dates) Jiyang Tongshou black dates are selling for 600 yuan, Changqing Tongshou black dates are selling for 550 yuan, Boping Tougao Zhuang are selling for 900 yuan to 870 yuan, and Chiping Shi Gaogao Zhuang are selling for 780 yuan.</p>
<p>(Melon Seeds) The market is mediocre as usual, with current prices at 540 yuan for Dalian Kui, 600 yuan for Mingguang Zi, 700 yuan for Jizhong Zi, and 750 yuan for Chongji Kui.</p>
<p>(Walnuts) Cunfeng sales are sluggish and trending downwards. The market price for Southern Walnuts is 450-6 yuan, Ti Tao is 520-500 yuan, and Hand-Picked Tao is 800-750 yuan.</p>
<p>(Persimmon Cakes) Arrivals are active and sales are brisk. Qing Bing is selling for 390 yuan, Taier Bing is 420 yuan, Pai Bing is 430 yuan, Geng Bing is 430 yuan, and Gao Huo is 450 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Miscellaneous Grains Unwilling to Sell Cheaply <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market started weak but strengthened later. This was because arrivals were still scarce, and merchants were unwilling to compromise and sell off their goods. A shipment of 50 bags of Chongming sand yellow was priced at 330 yuan. A shipment of 20 bags of sand red was priced at 332 yuan with return of bags, or 340 yuan with bags. A cart of Feiyu bean cake was priced at 91 yuan. 500 pieces of Changji bean cake were priced at 89.5 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Yuanji bean cake were priced at 87 yuan to 91.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Huisi Iron Short Supply and Expensive <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's trading in 200-yard Huisi iron was affected by the short supply in the market. Wholesale business was limited, and only retail transactions in door shops met market demand. Therefore, those holding goods demanded high prices, requiring 1,800 yuan per case. However, dealers with small inventories continued to hold on and were unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, it is quite difficult to collect a large quantity of spot goods at once. It is speculated that the market outlook is likely to improve further. Other hardware items are also priced high due to shortages, but sales are difficult to come by.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Soap and Candles Rise Uncontrollably; Matches Show Little Change <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>In the daily necessities market, soap prices are taking the lead in rising, showing a trend of seemingly endless increases. The general public will not be able to afford it. Candle prices are also rising sharply. Match prices are stable as usual, showing little change. The current market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Matches: Phoenix 3,000 yuan, Golden Tripod 2,800 yuan, Beautiful 3,150 yuan, Miscellaneous Brands 2,100 yuan. Soaps: Gu Ben 550 yuan, Bai Xiangmao 510 yuan, Huang Xiangmao 450 yuan, Scissors 530 yuan. Candles: White Lay's 510 yuan, Monk's Cap 450 yuan, Miscellaneous Brands 340 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Cigarette Market Calm <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market has been relatively stable recently. Since the news of the establishment of the China Tobacco Association, industry members have been quite concerned. It has been learned that the factory has been busy with procedures recently. Subsequently, it is estimated that about 150 dealers will be designated as distributors of rationed goods. Only those who pass the investigation conducted by officials from the highest authorities will be qualified. Regarding the merger issue and distribution of goods, the original factory may still choose and designate distributors. Therefore, industry members are actively joining the association. As a result, the organizational procedures for the association are quite troublesome and difficult to complete in a short time. It will take considerable consideration to mature. It is observed that the market situation will be delayed. Furthermore, there are recent reports of continued distribution of British-American tobacco, Japanese tobacco, and domestic tobacco. It is estimated that Great Britain will be 9,550 yuan, Old Knife 8,600 yuan, Pin Hai 7,100 yuan, Fairy 7,500 yuan, Five Flowers 5,900 yuan, Pyramid 6,300 yuan, Golden Gun 2,920 yuan, Golden Building 3,600 yuan, Red Rose 2,700 yuan, Quan Lu 3,320 yuan, Nian Zhi 2,950 yuan, Zhi Nan 2,550 yuan, Beautiful 5,500 yuan, and Golden Mouse 3,800 yuan, White Gold Dragon 3,800 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Tea Market Not Excited <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Although tea inventories are low, buyers are not excited because the lunar New Year is approaching. Therefore, the market is calm. Jixiangtai Tea Shop sold about 10 loads of green tea at a price of 420 yuan per load. Zhiji Tea Factory sold out. Another 7 boxes of black tea were purchased at a price of 855 yuan. Dingfeng Tea Factory sold out. Other tea pieces and tea cores remain unsold.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Striking the Bell <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongyi</p>
<p>There is a saying in colloquial language: "A monk for a day, strikes the bell for a day." Everyone thinks that is a "get-by" attitude to life, and is very undesirable. But I think, on the other hand, it can also symbolize a positive spirit. The key lies entirely in how you strike it? If you lazily and carelessly strike the bell, the sound will naturally not be clear and majestic, without the slightest power to move people. Conversely, if you strike the bell with full concentration, the effect is naturally different, and you become a good monk.</p>
<p>To put it plainly, from ancient times to the present, everyone is a bell-striking monk, but the sounds they strike are different. Some are vague, subtle, so low that they are even inaudible, while others can stir people's spirits, awaken people's dreams, resonate throughout the universe, and reverberate through the world. The difference lies only here.</p>
<p>Looking at the sages of ancient times, some were so busy that they did not have time to warm their seats, and ran around with disheveled hair and tied crowns: others were so devoted that they forgot to eat, learning the Way to save the world. To deduce their purpose, it is nothing more than wanting to be a good bell-striking monk. Their bell sounds will naturally remain in the heavens and the earth forever, and will never be extinguished.</p>
<p>We all need to actively strike the bell. No matter what class or society we are in, if we are determined to do good, we will be able to strike a magnificent and far-reaching bell sound.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Huxley on the Question of Human Immortality — One of the Letters of a World-Renowned Scientist <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— by Lincoln Schuster, translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>When I was young, it was as if I had been driven into this world, without guidance or training, or rather, worse than bad. I can shamelessly admit that there were few who committed deeper sins than I did. Fortunately, my path finally stopped at the right time—before I reached absolute destruction—and for many years, I slowly, laboriously, and shamefully climbed upwards, falling and rising repeatedly towards better things. When I look back, what exactly saved me? Was it the hope of immortality or the hope of future rewards? I can honestly say that these thoughts have never crossed my mind in the past fourteen years. Indeed not, I can tell you exactly what was at work. The philosophy of Sartor Resartus made me know that a deep sense of religion can coexist with a complete denial of theology. Second, science and its methods gave me a resting place independent of authority and tradition. Third, love opened to me the sacred realm of human nature, impressing me with a deep responsibility.</p>
<p>If I am not at this time an exhausted living corpse, if my destiny has already or will promote science, if I feel that I still have some trace of the hope of love for those around me, if my sorrow is filled with a sense of resignation without bitterness when I look down at my children's graves, it is because these forces have acted upon me, not because I would pay attention to whether my poor personality will forever be the same as "everything", that everything is what personality has always come from and is going to.</p>
<p>Therefore, my dear Kingsley, you fully understand what my position is, right? Maybe I'm very wrong, and if so, I know I will be punished for my mistake. But I can only say like Luther "Gotthelfemi Ich Kann nicht sanders." (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Listening to Yang Baosen's "Wu Zixu" <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Huilin</p>
<p>On the fourth of the month, Tianchan posted Yang Baosen's entire Wu Zixu, with Zheng Bingru and Ban Shichao's Jinshan Temple in front. The strength of the program was unmatched, so I drove there to watch.</p>
<p>Ban Shichao seemed to have come to Shanghai with Fu Liancheng before, but at that time, Shichao was just a bottom-level performer, filling third and fourth-rate roles. I didn't expect that after not long, he was actually singing the third act. Watching his nimble moves and tight sparring, he indeed had some skills. However, strictly speaking, he is still too "tender". Compared to Yan Shishan, who used to be under Huang Jin, he seems to be a step behind.</p>
<p>When it came to the Sacrifice Tower, the role of the White Snake was replaced by Bingru. This lady's appearance, posture, and singing are all top-notch. Among female roles, she can indeed sit in the first place. This is not me deliberately praising Bingru. Those who have heard Bingru's plays will definitely not think my words are outrageous. What I especially admire about her is the correctness of her acting style. Look at the female dan who have become popular in the South over the years, which one does not rely on a few plays of spinning cotton, enjoying pleasure, and tricking people? Which one really cares about art? Even if there are a few with great appeal, they are at most materials for a female clown. Zheng Bingru seems to be the only one who has established a foothold relying on singing and acting in the past two or three years. True, Bingru's art is still far from many veteran performers, especially her love for flowers and the use of cymbals between the erhu interludes to win applause from shallow people. However, even if she wants flowers, she has to be more elegant than others. There is a taste. That is her skill. Listen to her pronunciation and enunciation, how can those who have not been tempered for a long time achieve this? Especially since she does not have the feminine sound that is common to female actors, this point alone is not easy.</p>
<p>By the time Battle of Fancheng began, it was already 9:30 PM. Yang Baosen promoted himself as a follower of the Yu school, and sang in the Yu style and tune, which was very enjoyable. The "Elder Brother Speaks..." section, the voice was too low, but it became sweeter and sweeter after entering. Baosen's voice is like this: durable and long-lasting, unlike vulgar actors who become hoarse by the second half of the play. I want to praise it again: how can those who do not have real skills achieve this?</p>
<p>The entire Wu Zixu is said to include ten old plays. At least five major plays are included when cut in half. After Battle of Fancheng, Wu Shen Hui passed by flatly. Then came the climax of the whole play, the Wen Zhao Pass. Yang Baosen changed into an arrow suit and came on stage. A few rocking boards, talking and talking with flavor, worth shouting a "Good" word. After seeing Dong Gao Gong, as soon as the exclamation "Words Cannot Express" came out, I immediately knew that there was a good play to listen to below. Sure enough, the "Hate King Ping's Disorder in the Chu Palace" segment of the fast Xipi, sang each word with vigor, and each word came out of the dantian. After "A Round of Bright Moon...", there are three major sections in a row. The singing and enunciation are satisfying to the extreme. What is particularly commendable is that in the second sentence, "Sorrowful People's Hearts Are Like Arrows Piercing Through", Baosen sang in a crying voice. Wu Zixu could not pass Zhao Pass, and a feeling of worrying about the country and cherishing the family was vividly expressed. Chinese old things actually have such delicate and moving places, how can people not be amazed?</p>
<p>The Washing Yarn Stream and Visiting Zhuan Zhu are also quite worth watching. Supporting roles include Lin Qiuwen (who has the elegant name of Northern Hibiscus Grass) and Liu Yanting, who can be compared to green leaves for peonies, helping the whole play a lot. However, what I am most fond of is the following Meeting Ji Guang. "Wu Zixu, Wu Mingfu, the injustice of his parents cannot be avenged", followed by the crying head "Father and Mother", the sound is extremely desolate, and the high-pitched and impassioned sound from before has a different kind of emotion. By the time he was begging on the street, Wu Zixu's mood was of course not the same as before.</p>
<p>The final act is Wang Quankui's play. Since Qiu Shengrong's downfall, Wang Quankui has been the only copper hammer actor who has been able to walk across the country. After listening to the assassination of King Liao, someone next to me said: "It is simply no different from Jin Shaoshan". However, I feel that, artistically speaking, Wang is much more promising than Jin. The latter only relies on his voice to sell money, while the former not only has a strong voice, but also is full of charm.</p>
<p>Looking at the cast of Tianchan's current show, compared to the current general actors who carry the main roles, it is really like the difference between heaven and earth. The only shortcoming is the lack of clowns and inside actors. Although Cao Shijia can sing two sentences, it is still "lacking" when he plays Wang Ping in the Empty City Stratagem and Yan Yan in Dingjun Mountain. If Li Baokui and Zhang Rongkui were to "cash in" completely, the lineup would be even more complete.</p>

<p>At first, it took him some time to understand this. This is not to say that he was arrogant or exaggerated, it is only to say that when he had just passed twenty, he had ambitions, just like many other young people of this age. His original dream was to be a principal in the future, or in any case, to be a senior teacher in a really first-class school. After many trials and failures, he gradually realized that he was not qualified for these. For example, his academic qualifications were not very good, and his discipline, although very good and improving, was not necessarily absolutely reliable in all situations. He had no private property, nor any high relatives or nobles. Around 1880, after ten years at Brookfield, he realized that it was actually very difficult for him to move elsewhere in order to improve himself. But it was also at this time that the idea of "one movement is worse than one stillness" began to feel satisfying in his heart. By the age of forty, he had taken root, settled down, and was very happy. At fifty, he was a senior member of the faculty. At the age of sixty, under a young new principal, he was equal to the embodiment of Brookfield School—at the various banquets of Brookfield, he was a guest of honor, and in all matters relating to the history and traditions of Brookfield, he was the court of appeal. In 1913, at the age of sixty-five, he resigned, accepted a check, a writing desk, and a clock. With these gifts, he moved across the road and lived in Mrs. Wiggett's house. It was a well-calculated life, and it had a fairly good ending. At the lively banquet at the end of the semester, everyone cheered for old Chips three times.</p>
<p>Cheers of three cheers indeed; but there were still many things to come later, and unexpected endings. Once again, he took the stage in front of the audience watching the tragedy. (Five)</p>

<p>— Jiang Danshu</p>
<p>My second granddaughter, Mao Mao, is only five years old. One afternoon a few days ago, she was playing outside the gate when I suddenly couldn't find her. Knowing something was amiss, I searched until dusk, but she still didn't return. I was extremely worried and searched everywhere, even banging on the bottom of washbasins, but still couldn't find her. I suspected she had been lured away and was going to be extorted. While I was preparing to report the matter to the police, place an advertisement in the newspaper, and put up posters, the whole household was in a state of panic, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, two gentlemen brought her back. One of them held the child in his overcoat. He presented a name card, and I learned they were Mr. Liu Honglin and Mr. Lu Maochang of the Shanghai Special Municipality Police Detective General Team. My family resides on Route Say Zo Pong in the French Concession. This child had been lured to the Nanshi area, stripped of her cotton coat and velvet trousers, and abandoned in a desolate place, crying alone. These two gentlemen encountered her and rescued her. I am extremely grateful. I offered them a small reward, but they firmly refused to accept it. They even said that this was a duty that public servants should fulfill. Who doesn't have children? How could they bear to ignore it? Therefore, they did not hesitate to go to the trouble of quickly bringing her home at night. I admire these two gentlemen for two things: First, this child could not even explain her own address, and they had not seen any posters or advertisements, yet they were able to use their wonderful detective skills and were willing to search extensively in a wide area? They actually found her. Their resourcefulness and enthusiasm are beyond what ordinary people can achieve. Second, despite such effort and trouble, they did not accept any reward and were kind and approachable, setting an example of tolerance. Their integrity and honesty are even more beyond what ordinary people can achieve. Who says that in this degenerate world, there are no uniquely virtuous people? As for the bandits, their wolfish hearts and dog-like lungs separate family members. Even though it is for a short time, it is enough to cause the child to freeze and possibly die, or lead to repeated abductions and sales, causing the parents to die in anguish and other disasters. Their sins are truly great. However, since they are humans with round heads and square feet, and their actions are due to poverty, they are also acting out of desperation. However, they should do other kinds of sweet and willing work. This matter should never be done. I advise them to turn over a new leaf, repent, and return to the right path. Otherwise, if they persist in their evil ways, they will surely be filled with evil and suffer the consequences one day. I also hope that all those who have children will pay extra attention and beware of child extortionists.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the high pressure system from the northwest lingering in the suburbs, the temperature in this city has dropped sharply to below freezing, water turns into ice, and the north wind cuts the skin. Even those wearing thick fur coats and cotton clothes still feel cold. The winter relief work is even more urgent. After this newspaper initiated the readers' poverty relief fund, yesterday we again received Mr. Chen's voluntary donation of 200 yuan in national currency, anonymously doing charity, which is particularly admirable. We hope that all sectors of society will develop a compassionate heart.</p>

They were picked up by Mr. Ding Songqi near the racecourse and sent to our association." We hope the loser will go to the association to claim them.</p>
<h3 id="e85">YWCA Distributes Winter Clothing <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA, considering that poor compatriots suffer greatly from freezing and starvation every winter, has been distributing winter clothing every year. After this newspaper's family weekly called for donations for winter clothing this year, it received support from all sectors of society, and the response was very enthusiastic. The amount of donations received is only 2,000 yuan short of the predetermined goal. Furthermore, given the urgent need of poor compatriots in Shanghai, the association has specially exceeded its original plan to sew 1,000 winter garments, and has sewn a total of 1,200 pieces. Each piece has an average value of 30 yuan, and unemployed female workers, members of the Puyi Handicraft Society, and others are responsible for the sewing work. They have now been distributed to various institutions, including:</p>
<p>Fuyou Orphanage: 50 pieces</p>
<p>Nurturing Children's Home: 30 pieces</p>
<p>Puyi Society: 20 pieces</p>
<p>Various Shanghai Hospitals: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Churches: 100 pieces</p>
<p>Yangshupu Workers' District: 50 pieces</p>
<p>Route Robert Road Workers' District: 50 pieces</p>
<p>Shanlian Fire Relief Association: 30 pieces</p>
<p>Others were given to needy individuals through appropriate introductions.</p>
<p>In addition, the donations received by the association will continue to be reported below:</p>
<p>(1) Mrs. Xiao: 1,000 yuan; Yao Guangyu: 600 yuan; Miss Lin: 500 yuan; Pan Lubin: 500 yuan; Anonymous: 200 yuan; Wang Jian: 200 yuan; Guangzhao Girls' School: 180 yuan; Anonymous: 170 yuan; Qu Guohui: 130 yuan.</p>

<p>The above totals 7,362 yuan and 4 jiao, which, combined with the previous balance of 20,645 yuan and 4 jiao, totals 28,007 yuan and 5 jiao. Currently, the association is increasing the number of winter garments to be sewn, and there is still a shortage of 8,000 yuan in donations. We urgently hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to donate with a spirit of generosity. Please send donations to the association at No. 638 Weihaiwei Road.</p>
