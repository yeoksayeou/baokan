<p>社評</p>
<h3>新攻勢前夕的國際</h3>
<p>過去幾個星期，一般人的目光，大家集中在外交方面。在反軸心國方面，自從羅斯福邱吉爾的加薩勃朗加會議以後，最沂有英外相艾登訪美訪加之行、和美、蘇、渝、加各方面進行折衝，企圖解除英、美、蘇、渝間的矛盾，以應付就將來臨的國際戰局。在重慶方面，除宋美齡早已在美活動之外，最近又有宋子文和美駐渝大使高思及渝駐央大使顧維鈞等之先後　美，有所活動。這幾大還舉行了所謂太平洋作戰會議。雖然反軸心國之間的矛盾永不會有消除之可能，但是他　這種策動，和未來的戰局，自有很大的影響。</p>
<p>爲了反擊英美各國的外交策動，並且爲了在春季作戰中取得決定性的優勝，軸心各國的加强團結，有其史重大的意義。在歐洲方面，德義在羅馬會議之後，歐洲的全體動員已收獲更大的效果，而關於歐洲各國在反對「布爾塞維克」及猶太人旗幟之下，集中　力物力的運動，也在步步加緊推行；今後歐洲將在這一總目標之下，不容許有一分人力一毫物力逃避於　爭目標之外，是無疑的。在東亞方面，自東京日德義會議以後，緬甸行政自長之訪問日本，以及東條首　公開宜稱協助緬甸與菲律賓之獨立；繼之，東條首由之訪華訪滿，所有這些事實，都證明東亞方面反英美的戰鬥力，已在加强團結中飛躍發展着了。</p>
<p>當前兩大　營的外交的經濟的活動，到今日爲止，似乎已經有顯然的　果，接着而起的，將是春季的作戰了。在歐洲，莫斯科已經承認冬季反攻結束，而春季的大戰已在醞釀，德　和歐　各國的反共軍隊，正在踴躍開赴前方。在非洲突尼斯方面，英美的攻勢，似乎已到了窮途的時期。無論英美有着怎樣的野心，或許從突尼斯戰爭的結束，而向巴爾幹開闢所謂「第二戰綫」。但是軸心國的作戰，一向站在主動的地位。我們深信，必要的凖備早已完成，可以靜待新的戰報。而英美方面，却還不能不以東亞的新局勢而感覺不安，這幾天重慶和澳洲方面對英美所發的怨言，正可看出大戰前反軸心陣營的苦悶。</p>
<p>試看昨日德國宣傅部　郭培爾所說的：「在戰爭之中，最危險者，即爲幻想及自欺。」我們必須認淸更大的戰爭正在醞釀開始，正如郭培爾所謂：「關於宣佈總　戰爭後，從事工作之人力數目及得以加入軍隊服役之人數，將使最大之專家亦覺驚詫。」則我們應目問，對於國家，對於這次大時代前的戰爭，我們盡了多少力量？因此，我們也要求「每人皆爲總力戰爭而出其全力，無一人可希望避免其職責。」</p>

<h3>首都觀感</h3>
<p>— 劉漢儒</p>
<p>國府還都三年，首都各項建設，突飛猛進，本報爲參加慶祝還都盛典，特派記者代表赴京。駐京四日，目覩首都繁榮及各界熱烈慶祝盛况，爰就觀感所及，草成斯篇。　筆者謹誌</p>
<p>三月二十八晚，搭乘南京行之夜行車。北站的秩序，經本報及各界的籲請，已改善得多了，綿亘數里的人行列，不再看見，行旅從此稱便，足見當局勇於俯順民意。</p>
<p>一節二等車，被隔成兩段，一部份是軍人座，另一部是旅客座，大槪是慶祝還都的原故，那晚南京行的旅客，很是擁擠。</p>
<p>還都三年來，南京的人口，激增不已，旅館有供不應求的狀况，每逢到有什麼集會或是大典舉行，各方去首都的人極多，旅館業的生涯，尤爲鼎盛，這一次還都紀念慶祝的舉行，各省市地方代表雲集，南京旅館，一時家家客滿，記者幸得前兩日承南京同業錢人平君代爲預定一房間，　免得露宿，雖然房間是早兩天預定，可是亦要等到下午三時始「前客讓後客」的進得臥室。聽說前一二天，有很多人我不到宿處，跑到警署去要求警察爲之設法，警察特地領了客人到各旅館去問，或者借住民房，這樣子的擁擠，足徵各方赴京慶祝還都的情緒熱烈了。</p>
<p>到旅館後，因爲一時不能進房間休息，只有拖着一夜未合眼疲乏的身子，去辦理公務。在旅館前雇人力包車一輛，先至廟前進早餐，貢院街廟前一帶的市容，較一年前又繁榮多多，行人往來如織，已恢復了戰前的盛容。</p>
<p>總理像巍然地矗立在新街口路心公園裏，東西路口均新建綵牌樓，交叉的國旗下面，懸掛着慶祝標語，此處是大南京的心臘，行人車輛，如流水般不息。路西宣傳部門前，尤其是佈置得喜氣洋溢，六大條幅紅綢，配着金字，掛滿在建築物的外面，像做喜事似的。</p>
<p>在宣傳部裏，會見了指導司的劉司長，和新聞司的范司長，我代表本報請求指導，承兩位司長誠摯地對本報致獎勉勗導之詞，並指示在京參加各項典禮和參觀各處的辦法。</p>
<p>夫子廟的晚景，很値得留戀，菜館，戲館，門庭若市，歌塲，舞塲，亦進出頻繁，上海看不見的霓紅燈光，這裏是差不多各個店門前都有，熱閙的景况，據說要到夜晚一二點鐘，不像近來的上海，一到下午六七時，大部份的店舖就相率打烊了。</p>
<p>國際咖啡館，和新亞咖啡館是兩家名爲咖啡店而實際是跳舞廳的塲所，舞女端坐候客的制度是取消了，隨處應客侍坐，代價是拿酒來分別，從舞女所飲的酒上，可看見舞客所付的代價多寡，每杯酒自二十元至三百元，普通的以五十元至二百元爲多，這種制度，我想最近的將來，上海或許要仿</p>
<p>返庽所，時已近子夜，倒頭一覺，醒來窗外日已紅，夜來旅館的繁囂聲，毫未受到滋擾，實是幸事。</p>
<p>民國三十二年三月三十日，是國民政府還都三週年的慶祝紀念日，昨日天氣雖然陰晴不定，今朝却是豁然明朗，天順人意，豈不可喜。九時前十分，乘車至國民大會堂，這裏是能容五千人的一個大塲所，塲內參加的代表，已濟濟一堂，文武官吏與人民，台上台下，樓上樓下，佈滿全院。和平區內的全部請英，已萃集於此</p>
<p>九時正，主席翩然蒞臨，全院人衆，起立致敬，紀念儀式亦隨之開始。莊嚴肅穆的國歌，從每一個人口中唱出，這是，無指揮桿的五千人大合唱。（未完）</p>
<h3>中日經濟界座談會（三）　大陸新報會同本報召集</h3>
<p>許一卿先生：物資統制　，由日本當局交還中國，再由中國政府交給商業自治團體去　理，這當然是一椿極可欣幸的事情。日本是一個物資統制先進的國家，對於物資統制，當然有很好的方法，和很多的經騐，何以在華辦理物資統制，不能達到預期的結果？重要原因，就是民情隔閡。中國政府所以不自己辦，而交給民間去辦，也完全是顧慮到這一點。我們絕對承認交還物資統制，是日本幫助中國的一種善意表示，於中國的確有利。但是從大東亞主義着想，於日本也同樣有利，幫助中國，也就是幫助自己。所以我敢武斷的說，日本方面不僅是交還物資統制，讓中國自辦就算了事，一定還要從旁幫助中國，做到功德圓滿的地步。</p>
<p>自從政府公佈全國商業統制總會暫行條例，和戰時物資移轉取締暫行條例以後，就有許多人發生了無謂的猜測。他們的見解、是日本軍政當局雖然善意交還物資統制權，可是日本商人方面究竟抱何種態度，還很値得考慮。我個人的見解，却與一般人的見解，恰巧相反，我以爲應該考慮的，不是日本商人方面的態度，而是我們中國方面人民的態度。何以言之？日本在事變以前，即已實行局部統制，人民對於統制辦法，早已司空見慣，並且也已經享到統制的益處，對於統制　法還有什麼疑慮。其次，中日商人平等待遇，已成爲中日合作的信條，日本商人也早已明瞭此點，更無庸多事其疑慮。反之，中國人民向來習於自由放任，一旦乍受限制，轉不免於感覺到種種的不便。</p>
<p>方纔聽見一位在座日方商界領袖說起統制總會成立以後，將來恐怕商人要無事可做，我也有一點相反的意見。第一，統制總會旣名爲全國商業統制總會，顧名思義，商人的地位，祇有越法抬高；商人的工作，祇有越見重要。第二，中國的合作制度，還在襁褓時代，離開消費者與生產者直接交易的時期，還不知要經過若千歲月，中間全仗着商人爲媒介。緩和物資移動限制以後，商品格外暢通，商人的業務更可格外發達。不過物資流通以後，一切利潤，常然不能再如以往之優厚。關於這一點，我們似乎可以參照日本實行統制後利潤之規定，隨時要求當局予以調整。</p>
<p>統制總會純粹爲商業自治團體，對於商情方面，當然可以顧慮周到，不過希望統制總會主持諸君，同時不要忘記消費者立塲，對於民情方面也要兼顧。其次統制總會倉卒成　，一條規章多未具備，况且統制辦法，在中國已是創舉，由中國人自辦，更是創舉。社會方面，雖然不應求全貢備，但是主持總會的諸公，也萬萬不可因此就存着减輕責仟的心理。所有各統制國家的良好辦法，希望會中多多採用，所有社會上的輿論，多多聽取，更要做到下情上達，上情下達的地步，然後社會民生問題，纔有解決的一綫希望。</p>
<p>統制總會是全國物資統制的總樞紐，其中固然是包含着全國各地同業公會，但事實上仍將以上海工商業同業參加份子爲該會之重心。將來如何可以打消以往地域的經濟觀念，完全做到經濟一元化的最後目的，第一，要看該會重心份子，是否能先拋除地域經濟觀念，對於各地物資收購分配，能以公平的原則，爲合理的統籌，不沾沾以上海的工商業利益爲前提。第二，要看政府是否能運用他的政治力量去消除足以影響「國家經濟一元化最高政策」的一切障礙。政府將物資統制工作交給民間去辦，是要民間幫助政府分擔一部分責任，並非政府從此就可以卸除責任。我們要一致明瞭統制工作的成敗，直接可以影響民生問題，間接也有關政府威信，所以政府和人民，都應該各盡其力，幫助這一件事的成功。</p>
<p>緩和物資限制，是否就可以收到平抑物價的效果，還是一個很大的疑問。因爲近年來造成物價上漲的原因，甚爲複雜，物資之不能暢利流通，不過其中之一點，其他一切原因，例如運輸的困難，貨幣的不穩定等，不能消滅，物價恐怕還難有看小的可能。</p>
<p>最後還有一點，就是物資統制與生產有密切之聯繫。物資統制，僅屬治標；增加生產，方爲治本。如果生產不足，則一切統制辦法，有時而窮。所以本人借此機會，特別提出，希望政府及兩國經濟界共同注意。</p>
<p>武內先生：無論是姚先生和許先生的話，或是栗本先生的話，結局都以爲不問是安定物價的問題，和怎樣使得物資交流圓滑，以及爲欲儘量吸收內地物資而活用生產物等等，總不外乎在使得上海的工業生產力復興。在這點上，諸位先生的意見是一致的。最近中國方面的要人，常有物價問題是怎麼一回事的話，我總引爲不解。可是現在物價的　以這麼騰漲，並不是需要供給關係，也不是戰局怎樣的問題，我以爲在於上海談不到經濟的一點上。</p>
<p>因之，我們以爲爲　要對於中國經濟的復興建設，同時對於大東亞戰爭的完成，儘着最高度的努力，以躋達共同的目的，是這回政策轉換的目標。至於達到共同目的的最大要點，全在乎「經濟上海」的建設，換句話說，由着經濟上海的建設，而生出所謂經濟的事態，同時從「貿易上海」而轉變爲「生產上海」，由着道樣的大目標，在日華的合作之上以建設這所謂生產的上海，實在是這回政策轉換的日華共同目標。</p>
<p>站在這個觀點上，所謂上海的工業之復興和生產增强問題，爲本日第三個所要檢討的題目。更沿着經濟上海之綫，上海的商品交易問題，應當爲怎樣的構想，還是要諸位發抒高見的。</p>
<p>陳彬龢先生：（一）上海爲和平區內的唯一經濟中心，其經濟動向，足以決定全國，甚且足以影響重慶政權下之經濟動向，所以中日一方均應以最大的努力，以求其合理的發展。</p>
<p>（二）日本對華新政策之要義有三：1使國民政府强化，更能集中國力。2使和平區之經濟力能安定，而减少對日本之依賴，即减少日本之負担。3加强和平區之經濟力量，對日本戰時經濟作有力之貢獻。爲此三者之實現，日本放棄在中國之旣得權利，使中日兩國在完全平等地位共同努力。我們認爲也只有在這種新政策，即中日平等互助的基礎之上，才能實現上述三太要求。很明顯的，上海的動向，爲全國所仰望，所以更應樹立模範，以推動全國。</p>
<p>（三）中日經濟合作在上海之動機，要求，與立　旣如上述，尚須注意幾個具體原則，即1日方應放棄任何優越或優先權，在仟何　合，均應表現中日平等合作之精神；2華方應承認日本人士之創造精神，技術能力，而接受其援助與指導，勿存猜疑之心：3無論中日雙方，均應有遠大之眼光，而勿徒求目前小範圍內之利益。這三個原則，是必須切實做到的。</p>
<p>（四）現在來談中日經濟合作的方針：1凡適宜於完全由中國自己主持的經濟事業，亦即由中國自辦能收到比較日本主持更大效果之事業，應毫不躊躇，交給中國主持；2由中日兩國合作辦理最爲適宜之經濟事業，應由雙方誠意合作，以完成共同使命。3凡爲目前中國財力人力尤其是技術所不逮，由中國自己中持或中日雙方合辦均不及日本單獨辦理較爲有效之事業，在收回主權前提下，不妨交給日本繼續主持。4雖然有上列的分割，但中日之問應有密切的協定，在政府應有便於中日合作之法令，在中日經濟界之間應有爲親密合作而工作的「有力的民問　體。</p>
<p>（五）當前物價問題必先認淸其癥結所在，我們以爲最主要的，第一是幣値問題，如幣値不予以穩定，則仟何管制與限價都不會發生效率。第二是物資問題，如果不從增加生產增加物資上努力，則物價問題的一切對策都　落空。第三才是囤積居奇問題，一方向是物資持有者之不願賣出，一方面是一般貨幣持有者之購貨物，使物價更加　漲而形成社會上極嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>（六）除了穩定幣値與增加生產一大主要對策之外、純粹關於物價本身的對　，必　實行全面管制和全面限價。</p>
<p>1全面管制的要領：（甲）針對各省市物價不同之原因，不同程度之現象，物資之各別種類，性質，用途，價値，生產運銷之特殊情形，斟酌緩急寬嚴在全面管制之下作不盡相同的措施。（乙）管制機構必須統一，職權必須明確，人事必須整飭，力防政府與人民之間的任何隔膜，牽制及矛盾，（丙）全面管制實施之後，配合政治上的改善以及經濟上增加生產政策，尤其是財政金融之改善，物價才可得合理的解決。</p>
<p>2全面限價爲全面管制中第一重要之步驟，其要領如下：（甲）規定各省市縣對於所轄區域內重要市塲內物價運價和工資，從原料，人工，工其，生產，以至運銷分配，作全面的限價，而不能對生產者限價，以至阻滯生產。（乙）首先調查市塲物資的產，購，運，銷實况，定有計劃有組織的對策，並注力於各地物資之疏導，改善生產之區分，調劑市塲之供需。</p>
<p>（七）上海向爲工業生產之中心，當此戰時，尤應增產物資，以爭取勝利。而目前上海工業則在半停頓狀態中，此種矛盾現象，亟宜調整，主要原則：1積極促使工廠恢復生產，加緊生產。2上海工業品之生產量，足以充分供給和平區之需要，並推及於南洋各地，交換物資。3上海輕工業生產，與日本重工業生產，能相互分工配合，則於早日完成大東亞戰　之勝利，實有重大之決定作用。</p>
<p>（八）上海工業近年衰頹之原因必須站街研究明白，然後可以對症下藥。我以爲年來上海工業衰落之要因：1爲自戰爭以來，上海入非常時期，人心至今尚未恢復和平常態，視工業經營爲冒險。2由於幣値不穩固及物資之缺乏，人人以放出貨幣從事投機爲得計，旣助長囤積居奇之風，更擾亂市塲的平穩，暴利可得之於一舉手一電話之勞，於是無復願從事於工業生產。3中國資本經營工業無政治上之保障。4由於非常狀態之存在，工業生產之生產手段—即原料，器械，勞動力無可靠的來源，而生產品之運輸吏備受限制，再加以銷貨市塲之小穩定等都足以阻碍工業之發展。5金融界之投機，商業貸款之厚利，使工業貸款完全落空。6各工業生產者向無聯絡，各自爲政，不能成爲一種力量，政府與工業界均不作有計劃的生產。</p>
<p>（九）爲謀增加上海工業生產，必須澈底解決上列諸問題，消除上述諸阻碍。主要的是：1改善政治環境，予生產者以心理上以安定，而主要辦法爲（甲）减輕生產品捐稅，廢除苛雜及轉口各稅。（乙）保障獲得便宜原料及充分供給動力。（丙）由政府保本保息。（丁）限制運價，改善交通運輸及檢查辦法。2金融上盡力給工業生產者以資金上之幫助，特別獎勵中等工業及小工業，手工業等。各工業生產者可組成集團，銀行對此集團放款，而保障銀行之利益。3工業界成立自厲的組織，並進而成立中日工業生產者的聯盟，在中日當局的指導之下共謀合理的發展。4　禁投機及暴利，但扶助合法的交易所及股票市塲，以安定市塲而勸　游資投放於生產事業。（完）</p>

<h3>讀者論壇　對於南市的幾點希望</h3>
<p>— 小蘋</p>
<p>筆者生長於南市，求學於南市、除了八一三戰事時流浪在租界五年稍零外、結果仍投進南市的懷抱、因此我愛南市，更希望南市早一些復興。</p>
<p>南市居，有鬧中獲靜之趣，更於古老的建築物上，可以憑吊歷史上的一切，有些很自富於詩意的。</p>
<p>戰後的南市，當然已整頓改進不少，可是奢望的我，還覺當局用力太輕。</p>
<p>（一）道路　以中華，民國環城而言，低窪之處甚多，城內街道，亦多失修低陷，早宜修理。</p>
<p>（二）陰溝　路旁陰溝，久未疏浚，以致遇雨積水，傾汚成渠，宜令通暢。</p>
<p>（三）圾垃　報上屢載淸除，無如日久玩　，且僅運至附近空地上堆積，（如小東門至大東門一段，路旁纍纍如小阜），宜澈底淸除。</p>
<p>（四）交通　以前已有環城公共汽車，因汽油　乏而停辦，至少先恢復這一綫——無論電車木炭車都好。</p>
<p>（五）便溺　越是坍屋及空地多，隨意便溺的惡習，越易養成，想到天然就在目前，和去年真性虎疫的猖獗，可否請自警團和崗警同時努力禁止。</p>
<p>以上所舉，第一還該由居民自檢，應注意公眾衛生，惟以愚者多，自不得不借重當局的力量來查禁。</p>
<p>法租界接收在即，鐵門根本可廢除，南市居民增加，就在目前，倘不先事綢繆，不免使打算遷居南市者望而却步。</p>
<p>糧食局的措施，比從前好多瞭。一切　蹤租界，口糧已能按期購領了，這是値得報吿與要想來南市的朋友。</p>
<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>滬市上週金融與工商市况，　然穩定如恒。惟因日軍票停止新發行，一般人士不明真相，因而懷疑中儲劵聯銀劵之兌換問題，致各種市情箭呈動盪。但除若干物品市價徵見高漲外，糧食市價，仍趨平疲。餘如飾金，棉紗，布，燃料，雜糧，糖，油等公定價格，亦迄無變更。</p>
<h3>評言　合理化的物價問題</h3>
<p>處理任何一件事情，必須根據科學方法，適於合理化爲原則。當前的物價問題？論者不一，最合於釜底抽薪的辦法，莫如根究工厰的原料，開繳以及一切合理的利潤，都計算在內，求出一個公平正當的價値。那麽，不要說黑市價格，可以不致發生，就是藏貨不賣致使有價無市的惡現象，也不會發現。所以工厰的成本會計，是値得注意的一件事。</p>
<p>辦理任何一種工厰，在困難時代，是不容易討好的。價格高了，便影響到銷路，甚至使批發商零售商不願代爲推銷。售價低了，便影響到血本。解決的辦法，便在於根據原料進價，加上利息開繳，以及應有的合法利潤以外，絕對不該含混隱戤，或　意抬高，致物價高漲到漫無限制，這件事同業公會是値得注意，並且要努力執行的。如果發現限價在成本以下，便要提高限價，不致使厰商過份的吃虧，總之一句話，物價的原則在安定，不過高，不過低，並且變動不可太急。所以一切物價，倘根據科學方法，可以說是最合理的，不但可以使產銷兩方各不吃虧，彼此的業務也可以得到一個安定的結果。</p>
<h3>各當局切實整飭　滬工商業漸入正軌</h3>
<p>本市工商各業，諸如（一）取締投機交易，制止囤積居奇。（二）限定現貨交易，嚴禁買空賣空。（三）議訂標準物價飭令各業遵　。（四）厘訂買賣業規，切實付之實施，無論行號客買進或賣出之期現各貨，均經規定，須一律出立進出單。因此各業交易，有規可循，各種非法活動，及投機囤積似已逐漸消弭，物品供應在積極謀復工中。今後生產消費，可望平衡。社會民生，從此益趨安定矣。</p>
<h3>石渡顧間抵平　視察華北經濟</h3>

<h3>華中振興公司　召集首腦會議</h3>
<p>華中振興公司高島總裁，蒞任以來，銳意革新，茲定於今日起，分別召集所　關係公司主腦人物，舉行董監會議，分五天舉行。以便研究日本對華新經濟政策之大綱與方針。並討論如何集各公司之總力，以復興中國產業，藉以培養戰略戰力。</p>
<h3>浦東設立　苛性曹達製造厰</h3>
<p>據大通社訊探悉，本市有關當局爲解決肥皂原料困難起見，擬在浦東設立一製造苛性曹達之工厰，月內卽可開始建築工塲。今後本市製造肥皂之原料將有恃無恐，而華商規模較大之肥皂厰，亦可復工，肥皂產量增加，而肥皂價格亦必將回跌。</p>
<h3>生活必須品的動態</h3>
<p>牲畜</p>
<p>查工部局限價，每一斤猪肉是十三元八角，可是商民漠視公令，所謂限價，徒託空名而已，一般魚肉食品，原則上都有限價，而事實上都超出了限價，假使今天去取締的話，那麽明天的肉店裏，管叫你沒有一片猪肉可買。但是經濟統制應該普遍一律不能把肉類就置之度外。</p>
<p>那末，統制肉類的價格，用何種方式來處理呢，這還在於澈底改革牲畜市塲的機構，就是要把現在形成自由主義價格的市塲改成統制經濟下的市塲，牲畜市塲的改革，是急不容緩的了。聽說該市塲當局，已以草擬改革市塲機構的計劃。關於市塲機構的現狀和牲畜類的收買配給，爲詳細的說明起見，這裏先來把改革市塲機構的方向，作一個概述。</p>
<p>運銷到上海的牲畜類，從前和現在都是江北產居首位，猪牛亦然，江南方面僅不過一點水族家禽等類，太湖沿岸地區鎭江附近的產品，還能稍爲較多，猪隻一項，每年從江北新港新生張黃三港運到上海的，平均有六十萬頭，上海市民的猪肉消費量，全年約需一百萬頭至一百二十萬頭，這就可見上海全年的消費量，倒有半數以上是靠上開三港的猪隻，新生，新港，張黃三港，成瞭產地市場的中心，黃牛，水牛，以上各港一年總要運出五六千頭，說來是乎不多，可是在大江南北已經是占首位的了。像鷄，鴨，野鴨等等，新港，新生兩港每年約有五六十萬只運銷到上海來，但是水族家禽，還是江南比較豐富，最近太湖沿岸出產雖然减少，可是連鎭江西方下蜀港的鷄，鴨，野鴨併算起來，每年運銷到上海的約有一百萬只以上，上海四周畜產不旺，松江，浦東來的山羊約二千頭，鷄約二萬只，江北方面有畜農業，頗爲發達，看到畜產資源產銷圖，是這樣一個形勢，江北爲生產地，江南是畜產資源的消費地。</p>
<p>查中央市塲的進貨，去年下半期來源不旺，較之同年上半期及前年下半期，步步减少，肉價激　的根本原因，也在於到貨不暢的原故，所到的牲畜，都以糶賣方式交易，糶賣方式是否適合於經濟統制體制，後面再說，這裏先來談一談從市塲轉到消費者手裏的配給過程：</p>
<p>現在上海市上的肉類配給，要經過經紀人——肉商——零售商三個階段，但是大飯店大菜館等的大宗需要，可直接向肉商購進，可是一般人的需要，不得不經過多重的周折，若干商人也就從中取利，造成了步步高漲的局面，其實統制肉價，亦不十分麻煩，無須像統制工業製品一般的多方考慮，統制肉價的焦點，就是在於改革中央市塲的決定價格的機構，糶賣是自由主義的殘滓，不容它再存在的，問題就是要剷除這种積弊。</p>
<p>上下牲畜市塲方面，已在計劃改革草案，上海的肉價，不久當能趨入正常。（三月二十二日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>憶故鄕</h3>
<p>— 胡明揚</p>
<p>離別了五年的故鄉，那村舍，那溪流，在我的想像裏到如今未免是要有點迷茫了。可是我對於她所有的一切，却不知不覺地起了無限的依戀。記得我十三歲的那一年，我在忽驟的神情下踏上了漫漫的征途，輕輕地把我那可愛的故鄉，拋在後面，那時節我並不曾回過頭去看一下或則對她發生了那種依依不捨的感想，因爲可憐我那時候還懂不了這種心理呢。但是時光帶走了過去，一年一年的日子默默地消逝在那顚連的生活裏使得我對於過去的一切，發生了極度的贊美與渴望。所以我有時候偶然想起了舊日的歡笑，就要聯想到那美麗的故鄉，我夢幻着我生了二隻翅膀飛過了那曠野，重新投入了她的懷抱。</p>
<p>故鄉是浙江海鹽縣，屬於通元鎮的一個村莊，那裏的住戶，差不多全是同挨的弟兄叔伯們。在村的前面縈繞着一條流水，村的周遭環圍着田龔。所以每當春滿了大地的時候，四望都是翠綠的顏色，　如住在碧玉城裏一般。而尤其是那傍晚的時光，天上，散漫着紅色的彩雲，遠遠地看過去，好像是同這翠綠的原野相銜接似地。陣陣的飛鳥，從天邊飛來，忽兒便掠過了這田野，流水，一直向牠們的巢穴投去。在這當兒，往往可以看見年老的人握了一枝烟袋從田徑上緩步歸來，他們隨便地坐在門外的靑石上，讓晚風拂着他們的髭鬚，很安閒地抽着烟。滿臉的肌肉是那麼舒鬆着，老是掛着點兒微笑。那時候我們一羣的孩子們，便去要求他們講故事，當然咯，我們最喜歡聽的是那封神榜和西遊記，有時候我們聽得起勁，也許會得抽了一根木棒，自己稱起齊天大聖來的。</p>
<p>故鄉的男女老幼，在那時光，都浸在歡樂的酒中不知道什麼叫悲痛。雖然整朝是在工作着，可是誰都很快樂，在晚飯後，大家都聚在一塊兒，年長的談着他們的家常。小孩子們却隨意地嬉遊着，無覊無束，直像一頭天邊的飛鳥。</p>
<p>可是那美麗的生涯，一會兒便過去了。當我十三歲時，突然地故鄉的一切都起了轉變，我看不見那叔叔伯伯們的笑臉，也聽不到了那使人興奮的故事——封神榜和西遊記。只見每個人的臉上都流露着那種緊張的神情，不久全　都傳染着了，　是我自己也不知不覺地感到不安　夾了。後來我離別了我的故鄉，走上那漫漫的征途，屈指已經五年了。我是十分渴望着那村　的流水，屋角的斜陽，大邊的　鳥，還有那五月裏菜花香。我希　我能够重去過那一種醉人的生涯。可是　又不知道什麼時候，才能够回到我那可戀的故鄉去呢。</p>
<h3>愚翁小傳</h3>
<p>— 凡中</p>
<p>在智村裏面住着一位愚翁，因他從不對人說起過姓名。即使問他，他也只說：「哈哈！這個我倒忘了。」於是人們從他的行爲假定他姓愚，從　的年紀假定他名翁。就是翁字也不一定是尊稱，因　　智者羣裏往往會把這個字寓着諷刺的意義的。</p>
<p>愚翁的家裏，只　破屋一楝和空地一方。他沒有家屬親朋。每天餘了自已的工作外，就做　　人稱爲頂石臼做　的愚事。</p>
<p>智村人口還興　　智公，智　，智夫，智婦，智姐，智妹，　兄，智弟……倒也不少。愚翁雜裏而，更加　　他愚笨不堪。</p>
<p>有一天，有人發見村外河堤被冲去了一小角這是　自己有名　的事，　就去報告智村長，智村長立刻召集了全體智村民，商討修補辦法。愚翁知道了這件事，很焦急，但是他沒有資格參加，徘徊在智村長屋外，希望裏面商量得有好辦法。</p>
<p>太陽已落山了，全體智村民擁出屋子，據說這件事還得等明天繼續商量下去。</p>
<p>月色朦朧，初春的晚風吹在身上，使人感到一些凉意。智村已睡得靜靜的沒有一些聲息。村街上有一個老人挑了一付担子，　着沈重的步子前進。他就是愚翁。</p>
<p>他走到的約有一里路外的河堤旁邊，找到了損壞的一角，開始他愚笨的工作。</p>
<p>第二天，有一個智夫走過河堤，看見被冲壞的一角已被　好了，他智慧一動，立刻跑回村去，向村民們叫道：</p>
<p>「你們可以安居樂業啦！我已經把河堤修　了。」</p>
<p>愚翁也跳出屎子，向村民高叫道：</p>
<p>「來慶祝吧！我們的某智天已把河堤修好了，救了我們全村了。」</p>
<p>他聲嘶力竭，終於因爲過度興奮，倒在地上。</p>
<p>智民們擁着修補河堤的智夫跳躍歡呼。這個智夫後來還得到智村長的一筆獎金。</p>
<p>智村上不再看見愚翁的蹤跡了，智民們都　手　慶，智村上洗去—一個汚點。</p>
<h3>粗野的呼號</h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>沒有詩，也沒有文，</p>
<p>甚至，並不會吟詩，</p>
<p>我原來是個武夫，</p>
<p>不是詩人；</p>
<p>一向，我只會握緊了劍作　直的叱駡，</p>
<p>粗野的鬥爭，</p>
<p>於今，光明和黑暗的博鬥，</p>
<p>已揭開了現實的陰面，</p>
<p>一切都已血淋淋的，</p>
<p>而又那樣明顯。</p>
<p>我不能不感到心靈上，</p>
<p>沉重的負載，</p>
<p>强烈的憎，</p>
<p>汹湧的愛，</p>
<p>彈動着我的心弦，</p>
<p>終于，不　練地提起了筆，</p>
<p>我將效仿山風怒吼，</p>
<p>搖撼那陰森的松林；</p>
<p>又似浪濤澎湃，</p>
<p>冲擊固牢的堤岸。</p>
<p>然而，我又開始了懷疑，</p>
<p>彷徨於無地，</p>
<p>爸爸血　的眼，</p>
<p>媽媽枯皺的臉，</p>
<p>我不　興來刻劃，</p>
<p>這不過是個人的煩惱，</p>
<p>現實承授給我們的，</p>
<p>煩悶和苦痛，</p>
<p>豈單這點，</p>
<p>將百萬倍的嚴重。</p>
<p>我尚憐憫於陰暗牆角裏，</p>
<p>被遺棄的屍骨，</p>
<p>和灰色的　，</p>
<p>可是，我並不想幫他們哀求，</p>
<p>我知道，</p>
<p>他們不比我懦弱，</p>
<p>會任人屠宰割，</p>
<p>奴隸們已經起來了，</p>
<p>他們有着光明的未來。</p>
<p>至於，舞蹈在骷髏堆上，</p>
<p>嚼食人肉的，</p>
<p>歡飲人血的，</p>
<p>一羣，</p>
<p>更不必宣告他們的命運，</p>
<p>晨曦早在東方閃爍，</p>
<p>愛神也已撒播下，</p>
<p>正義的，神聖的鮮花，</p>
<p>那末，</p>
<p>魔鬼們帶着强權，殘暴，</p>
<p>從世界上消失的時候，</p>
<p>還會遠嗎？</p>
<p>橫在我眼前的，</p>
<p>依舊是一張白紙，</p>
<p>沒有詩，也沒有文，</p>
<p>我原來是個武夫，</p>
<p>不是詩人；</p>
<p>造物者老早替我們，</p>
<p>寫成了燦爛的詩篇，</p>
<p>我還是握緊了劍，</p>
<p>作率直的叱駡，</p>
<p>粗野的鬥爭吧！</p>
<p>正對着現實，</p>
<p>陰暗的一面！</p>
<h3>感觸和意見</h3>
<p>— 肖洛</p>
<p>每天看看報紙副刋中的文章和雜誌里的創作，我總覺到這樣，很多都是千篇一律的戀愛小說，和脫離現實的烏托邦理想。當然也有許多文章是好的，是不可否認的。但是我總認爲上海的文化界一般的太消沉了。</p>
<p>「文藝與時代有密切的關係，」這是本刋啟事上的第一句話。這個「文藝」當然不是指上面的兩種。旣然文藝與時代有密切的關係，那至少要與這個時代保持很好的聯系。文化人的筆尖，應該是一把利劍，牠將刻劃下　與惡，光明與黑暗的分野，替這個動盪的時代留下個影子來。</p>
<p>我感到，我們的文章必須注意到這幾點；</p>
<p>應該是實際的，不是由腦子里空想出來的，是自己親身觀察經歷過的實際生活的紀錄。</p>
<p>應該繼量的力求通俗化，文章的水準，應該要顧全到敎育程度低的讀者。</p>
<p>應該多描寫下層社會的實情，像工廠中的工友，學徒，碼頭工人，黃包車夫……等的種種。我們應該充分了解他們在被舊社會迫害下，在生活高壓下切身的苦痛來喚起人們的注意和同情。</p>
<p>應該是充滿朝氣的，不悲觀也不消沉。</p>
<p>應該是潑刺的，小要儘是扭扭揑揑的不敢寫，像懼怕威脅，和顧全情面等。</p>
<p>誠懇地，坦白地，我提供上面的幾點意見，希望朋友們能給予補充和指正。</p>
<h3>落花　—獻給南妹—</h3>
<p>— 莎菲</p>
<p>又是落花日子！</p>
<p>花瓣一片兩片隨着微風飄下來，</p>
<p>我倚靠着樹身，</p>
<p>凝思着過去的事蹟。</p>
<p>也是落花的時節，</p>
<p>我携了你的小手沿了湖邊彳亍，</p>
<p>你笑着說：「多好玩，姊！最好我也會飛，像落花。」</p>
<p>當見湖邊樹上的花瓣　側的飛下，</p>
<p>剛離開那動盪着的上海，你病了，</p>
<p>鄉中的醫生搖着　離開你的病房，但你却笑着說：</p>
<p>「姊！我夢着我飛！飛！飛入了那淸澈的湖水，雖在這沒　落花的冬天。</p>
<p>「姊！你快別流淚，驚去了伴我的花仙。</p>
<p>你竟去了，含着笑，全不顧你親愛的姊，</p>
<p>恰似你喜愛的落花，飛去了，只度了一個短短的美麗的時間。</p>
<p>又是落花的日子，</p>
<p>花瓣一片兩片隨着微風飄下來，</p>
<p>我倚靠着樹身，</p>
<p>凝思着過去的事蹟。</p>
<h3>船中</h3>
<p>— 魯岩</p>
<p>事變後一年，一個深冬的傍晚，跟着蠕動的人羣擁進了停泊在浦江裏的小火輪，在黑暗的下層艙裏，找到了預定的舖位，放好了行李，倚在船頭上懷着一種暗淡的留戀的心情，向着久居的都市投了最後的一瞥，紳士淑女們正歡樂的享受着他們豐富的聖誕晚餐。</p>
<p>當矗立的高樓模糊的輪廓在黑暗裏完全消失了的時候，小火輪迎着浦江的高潮，漸漸地增加了速度。</p>
<p>這是目下行駛浙江海岸的唯一的小輪，乘客非常擁擠，尤其是下層艙，連堆貨的角落裏都躺滿了人，運貨的商人，回鄉的遊子，小政客，工人，學生，迷戀抗戰的靑年男女……</p>
<p>船雖然已經行駛了，可是人們仍舊嘈雜着，好像話老說不完，艙裏本來就是陰暗的，加上了人們噴出來的烟霧和水氣，一盞五支光的小電燈，更現得微弱的吐着黃光。</p>
<p>「唔！這麼小的船！我平生第一次乘！眞要命……」靠在舖上呷着綠豆燒的老頭子，咬了一口醬肉，搖着發亮的禿頭，說起話來落了門牙似地聲音。</p>
<p>「眞小是辦法…非…非常時期呀！老…老伯伯：您到哪兒去—回家吧？」躺在上層舖上的一個瘦俏的男人，說起話來眼睛總是一閃一閃地，連　頰上的肌肉也跟着抽動，看上去好像對你做鬼臉。</p>
<p>「唔，我嗎？到鎭海！』老頭子把一塊醬肉放進嘴裏，說話帶了一半鼻音。</p>
<p>『嘿！告訴你們，從前這隻船不要錢也沒有人坐，記得是三年前吧？　！不對，是戰事前，這船的買辦不要水脚要我們裝貨，我們還怕它不穩當哩！」倚在門口正無聊的彈着板壁的小伙子，看上去像是一個商店的夥計，也挿淮來。</p>
<p>「眞不是辦法！可是又沒有別的船，老李！什麼雷…雷斯…　開　不？</p>
<p>『克雷斯汀，聽說要恢復行駛了！』</p>
<p>「對了！克…雷雷期汀，那隻船才好哩！是鐵檣的！」那個又不停地閃着眼。</p>
<p>「聽說從石浦到寗波，那條路—不太平？』說這話的是一個十六七歲的孩子，眼睛不停地看着各人的臉，正等着回答。</p>
<p>「唔，是的！就是上次出的岔子！』老頭又拈了一塊醬肉，對那孩子瞟了一眼。</p>
<p>「眞不是辦法！非常…時…時期呀！坐轎子起早，要走得早！」瘦俏的男人說這話的時候，眼睛更閃得利害了，臉和嘴都有節奏的抽動着，那個孩子對他看了一眼，想笑可是極力忍着沒笑出來。</p>
<p>「哩！我說啊！還是坐航船的好！有水警跟着！」倚在門口的小伙子打着呵欠，手仍舊彈着艙板。</p>
<p>「唔，航船也不穩當，夜問開船，沒有燈，常常對面來的船部看不出，有時水警自已就進樣互相開槍打起來！」老頭嘴裏又啣着了醬肉。</p>
<p>「那末！這條路不能走又怎麼辦呢？」先前問話的孩子用懷疑的目光看着衆人，，顯然他們的話沒有使他得到滿足。</p>
<p>「那也不然，走總得走，不過，不過有水警跟着總要好一點！倚在門口的小伙子已經爬上了床舖，在悠間的抽着烟。</p>
<p>「得了！水警，水警，他們見了土匪比誰都逃得快，怕把他們的槍繳了去！上次我特請他們保護我的家眷起早，他們不肯去！」坐在艙面小桌子上的穿西裝的漢子，忽然氣冲冲地喊起來，大家的眼睛都注視着他。</p>
<p>「所以，我說現在時候，沒有事最好不要出門，要出門就免不了冒險受罪，譬如我們這船每次快到石浦的時候總熄了　燈，因爲象山港外面就有一個大海盜窠，常常攔刦追擊商船，要是夜間停泊港外就更危險！」一個茶房房模樣的人很有經騐似地說，從他　風霜剝蝕滿佈着皺紋的臉上看來，他是一個老航海八的。</p>
<p>眞不是辦法！眞…不…是辦法……</p>
<p>「砰　」</p>
<p>在艙裏最暗的一角，有人把什麼東西摔在地上，大家的目光都不的而同的看過去。</p>
<p>「不行！不行！你這鬼老婆子！這兒又不是慈善機關，這是「外國的商船！」帶着白頂帽子的船員憤怒的喊着，把「外國」兩個字說得特別響。</p>
<p>「好先生，做做好事！我實在沒有錢了！我的兒子在戰塲上被打死了！我是一個無家可歸的苦老婆子，求：求您做做好事…讓我……」</p>
<p>「眞討厭！船票要四十塊錢，你祇有十塊錢怎麼行？還要吃飯！」</p>
<p>「大先生！我求您行個好！帶我到了鄉下！求您可憐可憐我這苦老子吧！」一個白髮的老婆子跪在艙板上，哭喊着，求着那個船員，她的聲昔顫抖着，一隻飯碗被摔破在地上，飯撒了一地。</p>
<p>「唔，也眞可憐！人們都給戰爭害苦了！唉！」。老頭子嘆了口氣把最後一塊醬肉放在嘴裏，酒已經喝完了。</p>
<p>船的速度愈走愈快，船身因着海浪的　擊不停地搖動着，艙裏暫時沉寂着，每個人都蹟進了被窩。</p>
<p>不知什麼時候艙　的電燈熄滅了，人們又開始喧閙起來，男人們叫着茶房，小孩子哭喊着，女人咒駡　什麼，亂成一片。</p>
<p>「茶房，怎麼回事？電燈壞了嗎？」老頭子大聲的喊着。</p>
<p>什麼事情？老伯伯！」睡熟了的那個十六七歲的孩子也被吵醒了，可是老頭子並不理他，祇焦急的捶着舖板。</p>
<p>「來了！先生！不要吵！後面有船…………」</p>
<p>「眞小是辦法…怕不…是…海…盜…」瘦俏的男人也醒了，因爲沒有燈光誰也瞧不見他是否在睫　眼。</p>
<p>大家都睜着眼，一聲不響地躺在床上，內心裏不停地跳動着，沉靜統治了整個的船艙，一直到電燈又亮了的時候，大家　透了一口氣，重又打起粗壯的　　來。</p>

<h3>International Situation on the Eve of a New Offensive</h3>
<p>In the past few weeks, the general public's attention has been focused on diplomacy. On the side of the anti-Axis powers, since the Casablanca Conference between Roosevelt and Churchill, British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States and Canada, and his consultations with the U.S., Soviet Union, Chongqing, and Canada, have been aimed at resolving the contradictions between Britain, the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Chongqing in order to prepare for the upcoming international war situation. In Chongqing, in addition to Soong Mei-ling's activities in the United States for some time, Soong Tzu-wen, U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss, and Chongqing Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin have also recently visited the United States one after another, engaging in activities. These major powers have also held a so-called Pacific War Council. Although the contradictions between the anti-Axis countries can never be completely eliminated, their maneuvers will have a significant impact on the future war situation.</p>
<p>In order to counter the diplomatic maneuvers of Britain, the United States, and other countries, and to gain a decisive advantage in the spring offensive, the strengthening of unity among the Axis powers is of great significance. In Europe, following the Rome Conference between Germany and Italy, the total mobilization of Europe has yielded greater results. The movement to concentrate manpower and resources in European countries under the banner of opposing "Bolshevism" and Jews is also being intensified step by step. In the future, Europe will not allow a single person or a single resource to escape the war aims under this general goal, that is undoubted. In East Asia, since the Tokyo Conference between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the visit to Japan by the head of administration of Burma, and Prime Minister Tojo's public declaration to assist the independence of Burma and the Philippines; followed by Prime Minister Tojo's visits to China and Manchuria, all these facts prove that the anti-British and anti-American combat power in East Asia is developing rapidly in strengthened unity.</p>
<p>The diplomatic and economic activities of the two major camps have, to this day, seemingly had obvious results, and what follows will be the spring offensive. In Europe, Moscow has already acknowledged the end of the winter counteroffensive, and the spring battle is brewing, with German and anti-communist troops from various European countries eagerly heading to the front. In the Tunisian region of Africa, the British and American offensive seems to have reached a dead end. Regardless of the ambitions of Britain and the United States, they may open a so-called "second front" towards the Balkans from the end of the Tunisian war. However, the Axis powers' operations have always been in a proactive position. We firmly believe that the necessary preparations have already been completed, and we can quietly await the new war reports. On the other hand, Britain and the United States cannot help but feel uneasy about the new situation in East Asia. The complaints issued by Chongqing and Australia against Britain and the United States these days can reveal the distress of the anti-Axis camp before the war.</p>
<p>Consider what Goebbels of the German Propaganda Department said yesterday: "In war, the most dangerous things are fantasy and self-deception." We must clearly recognize that a greater war is brewing and beginning, just as Goebbels said: "The number of people engaged in work after the declaration of total war and the number of people who can join the army will amaze even the greatest experts." Then we should ask ourselves, how much effort have we put into the country and into the war before this great era? Therefore, we also demand that "everyone should do their best for the total war, and no one can hope to avoid their responsibilities."</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Fukuoka After Completing His Mission to Manchuria, Expressing Great Delight at the Realization of His Long-Held Wish, and Meets with Governor-General Koiso and Director-General Tanaka in Korea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 4:00 PM on the 4th that Prime Minister and Minister of War Tojo had completed his scheduled visit to Manchuria and returned to Fukuoka at 4:00 PM on the 4th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo, accompanied by Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato, and secretaries Akamatsu, Shikaoka, and Hattori, flew to Xinjing on the 31st of last month. He paid respects to His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo and offered congratulations on his well-being. He also visited Prime Minister Zhang Guowei and other important figures, holding cordial talks. He expressed his congratulations on the rapid development of Manchuria's national construction over the past ten years, and inspected the current situation of various local institutions. Now that the mission to Manchuria has been completed, he took a train from Xinjing at 6:30 AM on the 2nd to return home. At 9:55 AM on the 4th, he arrived in Keijo (Seoul), where Governor-General Koiso of Korea, along with Director-General Tanaka, welcomed him at the station. They went together to the Chosun Hotel, and from 10:10 AM at the hotel, he met with Governor-General Koiso, Director-General Tanaka, and Chief of Staff Ihara of the Korean Army, listening to Governor-General Koiso's report on all aspects of Korea for about seven hours. Chief of Staff Ihara also gave a report of about half an hour. At 1:55 PM, he departed by plane, returning to Fukuoka at 4:00 PM. Currently, cooperation between Japan and its allies Germany and Italy is becoming increasingly close. Prime Minister Tojo's visits to China and Manchuria will certainly make the relations between Japan, China, and Manchuria even closer. At the same time, the determination of the three countries to complete the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly clear.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech after arriving in Fukuoka at 4:00 PM this afternoon, stating in essence that he had long wished to visit Manchuria, pay respects to His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo, express congratulations on the country's rapid development over the past decade, and express gratitude for the cooperation given to Japan since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, he could also have cordial talks with the heads of the Manchukuo government and inspect the current situation of various local institutions. He was extremely pleased that his long-held wish had been realized. He was especially honored to have had the opportunity to meet with His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo and receive generous hospitality, as well as to visit the Kenkoku Shrine. At the time of the founding of Manchuria, today, Manchuria has been united in mind and spirit, building a tight national defense. Now, ten years after the founding of Manchuria, there has been great progress in politics, economy, and transportation. When Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, Manchuria also wholeheartedly resolved to cooperate with Japan with all its strength, engaging in guarding the north and increasing productivity, making a great contribution to directly cooperating with Japan in conducting the war. In accordance with the spirit of Japan-Manchukuo joint defense, the Manchukuo government has been making every effort to strengthen various facilities, while also conducting intense training of the national army day and night. In recent years, there has also been vigorous cooperation with Japan in the mobilization of resources such as copper, iron, and other mineral resources, and a large amount of food has also been transported to China and Japan. I was very excited to see this reality, and I am very excited about Manchuria's cooperation in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. The Kwantung Army and various local institutions, which are responsible for guarding the north, are working very hard, and they are not forgetting training and vigilance day and night. At the same time, they are cooperating closely with Manchuria, moving towards a common goal. This is not only extremely grateful to us, but also doubles our determination. When I visited the Republic of China, I witnessed the spirit of the Chinese people to live and die with Japan, and the determination to build a new China and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, and all the facilities have made great progress. Before visiting Manchuria, I had a meeting with Dr. Ba Maw, through which I learned about Burma's ardent hope to establish an independent and free country and its intention to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. Now, when I visit Manchuria, I can see the development of Manchuria and the firm pleasure of strengthening the unity between Japan and Manchuria, and I feel even more delighted in my heart. The future of East Asia is bright.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Consolidates Central Front to Defend Against German Summer Offensive</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency, a British visitor in Moscow reported yesterday that the most difficult and urgent task of the Soviet High Command is to consolidate the Soviet front in the center. The Red Army is currently digging tank traps, setting up machine gun positions, and laying mines in military key areas. The Soviets expect the Germans to attack from the Smolensk area in the summer.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - Havas military commentator Steel-Fret stated that because the Eastern Front has thawed everywhere, only a few battles occurred in the week of March 27 to April 2. The Soviets attempted to break through from the north, in order to cut off the German connection at the bridgehead, but were repelled by the German-Walloon coalition. There were only a few battles in the Alaft Hill area. The Germans northwest of Kursk occupied the city of Sevsk. The Soviets continued to attempt to break through to Staraia Russa south of Lake Ladoga on the northern front, but the troops used were defeated despite their large number. The intensity of the battles in March can be seen from the heavy losses of the Soviet army, which lost a total of 2,200 tanks and 1,260 aircraft.</p>
<h3>Commander of Italian Destroyer Flotilla, Gasparri, Killed in Action</h3>

<h3>Quiet Situation in Tunisia, German-Italian Allied Forces Improve Positions, British and American Forces in Central and Southern Regions are Reorganizing, Fierce Fighting Could Resume at Any Time</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas News Agency military correspondent, the new positions of the German and Italian forces in southern and central Tunisia were not subjected to fierce attacks on Friday. General Montgomery's new artillery positions are clearly still incomplete, and the silence of the British Eighth Army has also had a considerable impact on the activities of General Patton's U.S. Fifth Army. Near El Guettar and Maknassy, the U.S. forces have not launched any further attacks in order to break through the German and Italian lines. The German forces in those two places have launched local counterattacks, which have greatly improved the positions of the Axis forces. The German forces used smaller infantry units to launch courageous attacks on numerically superior enemy forces, capturing several hill positions. The left flank of General Patton's forces, operating west of البيسون (probably a misspelling), has not made the important progress that the anti-Axis side claims. The same is true of the French rebel forces under General Giraud operating in the Bou Arada area further north. The British forces under General Anderson in northern Tunisia are still carefully advancing towards the new Axis positions south of Cape Serrat. The general lull in fighting activity throughout Tunisia at this time seems to be only a temporary phenomenon. The enemy is clearly still determined to fight to the finish. Although the U.S. forces appear to be slightly exhausted, the British forces have not yet exhausted their offensive power. Therefore, fierce fighting could resume at any time.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers, a statement issued yesterday by General Eisenhower's headquarters stated that in addition to General Patton's U.S. Fifth Army, there are at least eight British divisions operating in the Tunisian theater. The British First Army under General Anderson includes the First Armored Division and the First Infantry Division, the Ninth Division, and the Thirty-fourth Division. The British Eighth Army under General Montgomery includes one New Zealand division, one Indian division, and two British divisions (the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Divisions). The U.S. forces under General Patton have been reorganized and separated from the British First Army.</p>
<h3>German Tank Reserves to Join the Battle When the Time is Right</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to German official news agency reports last night, the British and American forces in central and southern Tunisia were prevented from launching large-scale offensives on Friday, while the German forces carried out larger military operations in adverse weather conditions to improve their positions. Generals Montgomery and Patton are clearly forced to reorganize their forces because their troops suffered heavy losses in the previous days. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Berlin, General Arnim's troops in northern Tunisia have occupied new positions in the Djebel Ahmar area. A Reuters correspondent with the U.S. forces in central Tunisia reported last night that the U.S. troops in the Fondouk area have retreated slightly and are now cooperating with the French forces under General Giraud to strengthen their new positions. The correspondent also stated that German forces constantly encountered fierce resistance from German forces as they moved along the Gabès Road. At the other end of the road, the British Eighth Army also encountered German interceptions in the mountainous terrain. The fact that the Axis command is not satisfied with defensive warfare is evidenced by a communique issued yesterday by General Giraud's headquarters, which stated that Axis tank forces launched counterattacks north of Schott el Djerid. U.S. broadcasts from Algiers last night also mentioned the difficulties encountered by British and American troops in Tunisia, saying that people in Algiers believe that General Rommel is now trying to prevent the British First and Eighth Armies from meeting. On Friday morning, Rommel attacked the anti-Axis forces east of Gafsa with 35 tanks. Rommel now has a large number of tank reserves, which will join the battle when the time is right. According to the German news agency, the Axis military operations against the U.S. forces in southeastern Tunisia are quite noteworthy. German troops captured a U.S. fortress southeast of El Guettar in a surprise attack, and an important position near Maknassy was also recaptured. The U.S. forces suffered heavy casualties in the above two positions, with more than 300 prisoners. German dive bombers and fighters assisted the land forces in the areas of Autreville and El Guettar, which was very effective. The main purpose of the bombing was to target enemy troop concentration points and artillery positions. A batch of German dive bombers destroyed a U.S. heavy artillery piece, and more than 100 motorized vehicles were also destroyed by German aircraft.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister Visits Rome, Meets with Italian Prime Minister to Review Military and Political Situation, and Has Long Conversation with the Pope</h3>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Stefani news agency report, Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya, at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, arrived in Italy for an official visit from April 1 to 3, and took this opportunity to meet with senior officials of the Fascist government. During Kánya's talks with Mussolini and Italian Undersecretary of State Bastianini, they conducted a detailed review of the general political and military situation and various issues related to Italy and Hungary. The talks were extremely harmonious and confirmed the consensus of opinions between the two sides. After arriving in Italy on April 1, Kánya laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the graves of the martyrs of the Fascist Revolution. At noon, the Italian King received Kánya and his entourage and hosted a luncheon. In the afternoon, Kánya met with Mussolini again, talking for more than two hours, with the Italian Undersecretary of State also present. In the evening, the Italian Undersecretary of State hosted a banquet for Kánya, and gave a short speech after the banquet, wishing Hungary prosperity and Regent Horthy good health. Kánya also gave a reply speech. The next morning, Kánya met with Mussolini again and had lunch together. In the afternoon, he attended a reception hosted by the Governor of Rome.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, Hungarian Prime Minister Kánya's visit to Italy was still an "open secret" on Saturday night. Only the Vatican was officially informed. The Pope received Kánya at the Vatican in the morning for an hour and fifteen minutes. Kánya presented the Pope with a letter requesting the canonization of Margaret of Hungary. Later, the Hungarian Prime Minister introduced the Hungarian Ambassador to the Holy See, Ábel, and his entourage to the Pope. The Pope addressed them in Hungarian and blessed the Hungarian people, and presented his ceremonial seal to the Hungarian Prime Minister. Later, the Hungarian Prime Minister visited Archbishop Maglione, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, and prayed at St. Peter's Basilica, leaving the Vatican at nearly 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Romanian Leader to Visit Italy Soon</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, following the announcement of the Bulgarian King's visit to the German leader's headquarters, it has attracted significant attention from diplomatic circles and the foreign press here. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in response to inquiries yesterday, pointed out that such visits are extremely useful. Havas's special diplomatic correspondent stated that the Bulgarian King's visit to the German leader, the Hungarian Prime Minister's visit to Rome, and the Romanian leader's upcoming visit to Rome and elsewhere, mark the beginning of the annual spring activities in European international life since the outbreak of the war. The scope of this year's activities will bring European countries into closer contact to address the issues accumulated over the winter and prepare for summer actions. This activity is, of course, led by German-Italian cooperation, which has become an institution due to the close ties between the two countries. This diplomatic activity is not a vague discussion of the future shape of the world, but a practical increase in Europe's resistance. The anti-Axis side has been vigorously promoting discord among the countries of Southeastern Europe in recent months, but there is no longer talk of division between Hungary and Romania. Communist rebellions have occurred in Croatia, but have been suppressed by German, Italian, and Croatian forces. Bulgaria has also participated in suppressing Serbian rebellions and assisting in restoring order. Indeed, such restoration of order should be a collaborative effort, and efforts to strengthen the entire structure must focus not only on international relations, but also on the internal situation of each country. The stronger each country is internally, the greater its contribution to overall resistance. The British side has said that the Balkans are a convenient gateway into continental Europe, but it will soon be proven that the countries of Southeastern Europe have sufficient military strength to deal with poorly armed rebellions. In short, the Southeastern European countries fully understand the threats from the Bolsheviks and Britain and have taken appropriate measures.</p>
<h3>German Side Understands Bulgaria's Non-Participation in the War</h3>
<p>Madrid, 4th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch states that the Spanish newspaper ABC, commenting on the Bulgarian King's visit to the German leader, stated that Germany has repeatedly demonstrated its understanding of the needs and characteristics of other countries. This visit demonstrates that the political and military alliance between the two countries will become more active and sincere in the future. Bulgaria's non-participation in the war against Bolshevism has proven Germany's complete understanding of the problems of other countries. The Bulgarian people, with the help of the Soviet Union, broke away from Turkish bondage, and are therefore still very pro-Soviet. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect Bulgarians to immediately fight against the Soviet Union. However, this does not mean that Bulgaria is not a loyal ally of Germany. During the First World War, Bulgaria fought alongside Germany, and later suffered the shame of defeat together. Therefore, the two countries will never forget the armed cooperation between them. Germany has also expressed complete understanding towards Denmark. Although Denmark is under German military protection, it remains a sovereign state. Germany has not interfered in its internal affairs, and the country still follows democratic and parliamentary systems as before.</p>
<h3>"New Polish Government" Rumored to be Organized in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Warsaw, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Stefani news agency, reliable sources state that a "New Polish Government," as a puppet of the Polish Communist Party, will soon be established in the Soviet Union to confront the London Polish government-in-exile led by General Sikorski. It is reported that the creation of the "new government" is intended to "legitimize" the Bolsheviks' claims regarding the Soviet-Polish border issue. According to a reliable source, they may even announce the establishment of a Polish Soviet Republic.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Capital</h3>
<p>— Liu Hanru</p>
<p>It has been three years since the National Government returned to the capital. The various constructions in the capital have advanced rapidly. This newspaper, in order to participate in the grand celebration of the return to the capital, has specially dispatched a reporter to represent the newspaper in Nanjing. After staying in Nanjing for four days, witnessing the prosperity of the capital and the enthusiastic celebration of the grand occasion by all sectors, I have drafted this article based on my impressions.</p>
<p>—The author notes</p>
<p>On the evening of March 28th, I boarded the night train to Nanjing. The order at the North Station, after appeals from this newspaper and various sectors, has improved significantly. The mile-long lines of people are no longer seen, making travel more convenient. This shows that the authorities are willing to listen to public opinion.</p>
<p>The second-class carriage was divided into two sections, one for military personnel and the other for passengers. Perhaps because of the celebration of the return to the capital, the train to Nanjing that night was very crowded.</p>
<p>In the three years since the return to the capital, the population of Nanjing has increased dramatically. There is a shortage of hotels. Whenever there are gatherings or major ceremonies, many people from all over go to the capital. The hotel industry is particularly prosperous. This time, with the holding of the anniversary celebration of the return to the capital, representatives from various provinces and cities gathered, and Nanjing hotels were filled to capacity. Fortunately, two days earlier, I had Mr. Qian Renping, a colleague in Nanjing, reserve a room for me, avoiding sleeping in the open. Although the room was reserved two days in advance, I still had to wait until 3 pm for the "previous guest to give way to the next guest" to enter the bedroom. I heard that a day or two before, many people could not find accommodation and went to the police station to ask the police to find a solution. The police specially led the guests to various hotels to ask, or borrowed rooms in residential houses. This kind of crowding shows the enthusiasm of all parties to go to Nanjing to celebrate the return to the capital.</p>
<p>After arriving at the hotel, because I could not enter the room to rest for a while, I had to drag my tired body, which had not slept all night, to handle official business. I hired a rickshaw in front of the hotel and went to Miaoqian for breakfast first. The cityscape around Gongyuan Street Miaoqian is much more prosperous than a year ago, with pedestrians coming and going like weaving, and has restored the prosperity of the pre-war period.</p>
<p>The statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen stands majestically in the park in the heart of XinJieKou. New colorful archways have been built at the east and west intersections, and celebratory slogans are hung under the crossing national flags. This place is the heart of Nanjing, with pedestrians and vehicles flowing like water. The area in front of the propaganda department on the west side is especially decorated with festive atmosphere. Six large red silk banners, matched with gold characters, are hung all over the outside of the building, as if celebrating a happy event.</p>
<p>In the propaganda department, I met Director Liu of the Guidance Division and Director Fan of the News Division. I represented this newspaper in requesting guidance. The two directors sincerely expressed words of encouragement and guidance to this newspaper and instructed on the methods of participating in various ceremonies and visiting various places in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The night scene of the Confucius Temple is very worth cherishing. Restaurants and theaters are crowded, and singing and dancing venues are also frequently visited. The neon lights that cannot be seen in Shanghai are almost everywhere in front of the shops here. The lively scene is said to last until 1 or 2 o'clock at night, unlike Shanghai recently, where most shops close at 6 or 7 pm.</p>
<p>International Cafe and New Asia Cafe are two places that are called cafes but are actually dance halls. The system of dance girls sitting and waiting for guests has been abolished. They sit and serve guests everywhere. The price is determined by the liquor. From the liquor consumed by the dance girls, you can see the amount paid by the dancers. Each glass of liquor ranges from 20 yuan to 300 yuan, but the usual range is from 50 yuan to 200 yuan. I think Shanghai may imitate this system in the near future.</p>
<p>Returning to my residence, it was almost midnight. I fell asleep and when I woke up, the sun outside the window was already red. Fortunately, I was not disturbed by the noise of the hotel last night.</p>
<p>March 30, 1943, was the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Although the weather was uncertain yesterday, it was suddenly clear and bright this morning. The weather is favorable, is it not joyful. Before nine o'clock, I took a car to the National Assembly Hall. This is a large venue that can accommodate 5,000 people. The representatives participating in the hall were already gathered, and civil and military officials and people filled the entire hall, both on and off the stage, upstairs and downstairs. All the elite within the Peace Zone have gathered here.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock sharp, the chairman gracefully arrived, and the entire hall stood up to pay respects. The commemorative ceremony also began. The solemn and solemn national anthem was sung from everyone's mouth. This was a 5,000-person chorus without a conductor. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Symposium of Chinese and Japanese Economic Circles (3) Convened by the Continental News and This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Yiqing: It is certainly a very gratifying thing that the Japanese authorities have returned the control of materials to China, and then the Chinese government hands it over to the commercial self-governing organizations for management. Japan is an advanced country in the control of materials, and of course has good methods and a lot of experience in the control of materials. Why can't the control of materials in China achieve the expected results? The important reason is the estrangement of public sentiment. The Chinese government does not do it itself, but hands it over to the private sector, which is entirely due to this consideration. We absolutely acknowledge that the return of material control is a well-intentioned expression of Japan's help to China, which is indeed beneficial to China. However, from the perspective of Greater East Asianism, it is equally beneficial to Japan to help China is to help oneself. Therefore, I dare to assert that the Japanese side will not only return the control of materials and let China handle it on its own, but will also help China from the sidelines to achieve a complete success.</p>
<p>Since the government promulgated the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Federation and the Provisional Regulations on the Transfer and Suppression of Wartime Materials, many people have made unnecessary speculations. Their view is that although the Japanese military and political authorities have kindly returned the right to control materials, the attitude of the Japanese merchants is still worth considering. My personal view is exactly the opposite of the general view. I think what should be considered is not the attitude of the Japanese merchants, but the attitude of the Chinese people. Why do I say that? Japan had already implemented partial control before the incident, and the people were already accustomed to the control methods, and had already enjoyed the benefits of the control. What doubts are there about the control methods? Secondly, equal treatment for Chinese and Japanese merchants has become a creed of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and Japanese merchants have long understood this, so there is no need to worry about it. On the contrary, the Chinese people have always been accustomed to freedom and laissez-faire, and once they are suddenly restricted, they cannot help but feel all kinds of inconveniences.</p>
<p>Just now, I heard a Japanese business leader say that after the establishment of the Control Federation, merchants may have nothing to do in the future. I also have a different opinion. First, since the Control Federation is named the National Commercial Control Federation, the status of merchants will only be raised higher; the work of merchants will only become more important. Second, China's cooperative system is still in its infancy. It is not known how many years it will take to leave the stage of direct transactions between consumers and producers. In the middle, it all depends on merchants as intermediaries. After the restrictions on the movement of materials are eased, the circulation of goods will be particularly smooth, and the business of merchants can be particularly developed. However, after the circulation of materials, all profits will naturally no longer be as favorable as before. Regarding this point, it seems that we can refer to the regulations on profits after the implementation of control in Japan and ask the authorities to adjust it at any time.</p>
<p>The Control Federation is purely a commercial self-governing organization, and of course it can take into account the commercial situation in all aspects. However, I hope that the gentlemen presiding over the Control Federation will also remember the consumer's position and also take into account the public sentiment. Secondly, the Control Federation was hastily established, and many regulations are not yet complete. Moreover, the control method is an innovation in China, and it is an even greater innovation for the Chinese to handle it themselves. Although the society should not demand perfection, the officials in charge of the General Assembly must not therefore have the mentality of reducing responsibility. The good methods of all controlled countries, I hope the meeting will adopt more, and all social opinions will be heard more, and it is necessary to achieve the stage of conveying the lower situation to the upper level and the upper situation to the lower level, so that the social and people's livelihood problems can be solved.</p>
<p>The Control Federation is the central hub of national material control, which of course includes industry associations from all over the country, but in fact, the participation of Shanghai industrial and commercial associations will still be the focus of the association. How can we eliminate the past regional economic concepts in the future and completely achieve the ultimate goal of economic unification? First, it depends on whether the core members of the association can first abandon the concept of regional economy and use fair principles for the rational overall planning of material acquisition and distribution in various places, without focusing on the interests of Shanghai's industry and commerce as a prerequisite. Second, it depends on whether the government can use its political power to eliminate all obstacles that may affect the "national economic unification supreme policy." The government handed over the material control work to the private sector to help the government share a part of the responsibility, not that the government can be relieved of responsibility from now on. We must all understand that the success or failure of the control work can directly affect the people's livelihood, and indirectly affects the government's prestige, so the government and the people should do their best to help this matter succeed.</p>
<p>Whether the easing of material restrictions can achieve the effect of stabilizing prices is still a big question. Because the reasons for the rise in prices in recent years are very complicated, the failure of materials to circulate smoothly is only one of them. Other reasons, such as transportation difficulties and currency instability, cannot be eliminated, and prices may still be difficult to see small possibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one point, that is, material control is closely related to production. Material control is only a palliative measure; increasing production is the fundamental cure. If production is insufficient, all control methods will sometimes be exhausted. Therefore, I take this opportunity to specifically propose that the government and the economic circles of the two countries pay attention to it together.</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi: Whether it is Mr. Yao's and Mr. Xu's words, or Mr. Kurimoto's words, the conclusion is that the question of stabilizing prices and how to make the exchange of materials smooth, as well as how to absorb inland materials as much as possible and utilize production, is nothing more than making Shanghai's industrial productivity revive. On this point, the opinions of all of you are consistent. Recently, the important people on the Chinese side often have the question of what is the matter with the price problem. I always find it incomprehensible. But now that prices are so soaring, it is not a matter of supply and demand, nor is it a matter of how the war is going. I think it lies in the fact that Shanghai is not talking about economics at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to make the highest degree of effort for the revival and construction of the Chinese economy, and at the same time for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve common goals, which is the goal of this policy conversion. As for the biggest key to achieving common goals, it all lies in the construction of "Economic Shanghai." In other words, through the construction of Economic Shanghai, the so-called economic situation is generated, and at the same time, it is transformed from "Trade Shanghai" to "Production Shanghai." With such a big goal, the common goal of Japan and China in the construction of this so-called production Shanghai is based on the cooperation between Japan and China.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the question of the revival and production enhancement of Shanghai's industry is the third topic to be discussed today. Furthermore, along the line of Economic Shanghai, what kind of concept should be used for the problem of Shanghai's commodity trade, and I would like to hear your opinions.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Binhe: (1) Shanghai is the only economic center in the Peace Zone, and its economic trends are sufficient to determine the whole country, and even sufficient to influence the economic trends under the Chongqing regime, so both China and Japan should make the greatest efforts to seek its rational development.</p>
<p>(2) There are three essentials of Japan's new policy towards China: 1. To strengthen the National Government so that it can concentrate its national strength. 2. To stabilize the economic strength of the Peace Zone and reduce its dependence on Japan, that is, to reduce Japan's burden. 3. To strengthen the economic power of the Peace Zone and make a strong contribution to Japan's wartime economy. In order to realize these three points, Japan abandoned its vested interests in China, so that China and Japan can work together on a completely equal footing. We believe that only on the basis of this new policy, that is, Sino-Japanese equality and mutual assistance, can the above three major requirements be realized. Obviously, Shanghai's trends are looked forward to by the whole country, so it should set an example to promote the whole country.</p>
<p>(3) The motives, requirements, and positions of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in Shanghai are as mentioned above. Attention should also be paid to several specific principles, namely: 1. The Japanese side should abandon any superior or priority rights. In any cooperation, it should express the spirit of Sino-Japanese equal cooperation; 2. The Chinese side should recognize the creative spirit and technical capabilities of the Japanese people and accept their assistance and guidance, and should not have a suspicious heart; 3. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides should have a long-term vision and should not only seek the interests of the current small scope. These three principles must be implemented.</p>
<p>(4) Now let's talk about the guidelines for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation: 1. All economic undertakings that are suitable for being completely presided over by China itself, that is, undertakings that can achieve greater results if they are run by China than by Japan, should be handed over to China without hesitation; 2. Economic undertakings that are most suitable for being run by China and Japan in cooperation should be carried out by both parties in good faith to complete the common mission; 3. All undertakings that are currently beyond the reach of China's financial resources, human resources, especially technology, and that are more effective if Japan operates them alone than if China operates them on its own or if China and Japan operate them jointly, may be handed over to Japan to continue to operate under the premise of recovering sovereignty. 4. Although there is the above division, there should be close agreements between China and Japan, there should be laws in the government that facilitate Sino-Japanese cooperation, and there should be a "powerful civil organization" that works for close cooperation between the Sino-Japanese economic circles.</p>
<p>(5) To solve the current price problem, we must first clearly recognize the crux of the problem. We believe that the most important thing is the currency value problem. If the currency value is not stabilized, then any control and price limits will not be efficient. The second is the material problem. If we do not make efforts to increase production and increase materials, then all countermeasures for the price problem will fail. The third is the problem of hoarding and speculation. On the one hand, material holders are unwilling to sell, and on the other hand, general currency holders are buying goods, which makes prices soar and forms a very serious problem in society.</p>
<p>(6) In addition to the two major countermeasures of stabilizing currency value and increasing production, countermeasures that are purely related to prices themselves must implement comprehensive control and comprehensive price limits.</p>
<p>1. The essentials of comprehensive control: (A) In view of the different price reasons, different degrees of phenomena, and the special circumstances of production, transportation, and sales of different types, natures, uses, and values of materials in each province and city, appropriate measures should be taken under the comprehensive control according to the urgency and severity. (B) The control mechanism must be unified, the powers must be clear, the personnel must be rectified, and efforts must be made to prevent any separation, restriction, and contradiction between the government and the people. (C) After the implementation of comprehensive control, in coordination with political improvement and economic production increase policies, especially financial improvement, prices can be reasonably resolved.</p>
<p>2. Comprehensive price limit is the first and most important step in comprehensive control. The essentials are as follows: (A) Each province, city, and county should make comprehensive price limits on the prices, transportation costs, and wages of important markets within its jurisdiction, from raw materials, labor, tools, production to transportation, sales, and distribution, without limiting the prices of producers, so as not to hinder production. (B) First, investigate the actual production, purchase, transportation, and sales of materials in the market, set planned and organized countermeasures, and focus on dredging materials in various places, improving the division of production, and adjusting the supply and demand in the market.</p>
<p>(7) Shanghai has always been the center of industrial production. In this wartime, it should increase the production of materials to win the victory. However, the current Shanghai industry is in a state of semi-paralysis. This contradictory phenomenon should be adjusted urgently. The main principles are: 1. Actively promote factories to resume production and step up production. 2. The production volume of Shanghai industrial products is sufficient to fully supply the needs of the Peace Zone and extend to various parts of Nanyang to exchange materials. 3. The production of Shanghai light industry and the production of Japanese heavy industry can cooperate with each other in division of labor, which has a major and decisive role in the early completion of the victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(8) The reasons for the decline of Shanghai's industry in recent years must be thoroughly studied and understood before we can prescribe the right medicine. I believe that the main reasons for the decline of Shanghai's industry in recent years are: 1. Since the war, Shanghai has entered an extraordinary period, and people's minds have not yet returned to a normal state of peace, and industrial operations are regarded as risky. 2. Due to the instability of the currency value and the lack of materials, everyone regards releasing currency for speculation as a good plan, which not only fuels the trend of hoarding and speculation, but also disrupts the stability of the market. Huge profits can be obtained with a hand or a telephone call, so they are unwilling to engage in industrial production. 3. Chinese capital has no political protection in operating industry. 4. Due to the existence of extraordinary conditions, the means of industrial production—that is, raw materials, machinery, and labor—have no reliable sources, and the transportation of products is subject to limitations, plus the small stability of the sales market, all of which can hinder the development of industry. 5. Financial speculation and the high profits of commercial loans make industrial loans completely unsuccessful. 6. There is no connection between the industrial producers, and each acts on its own, unable to become a force. The government and the industrial circles do not make planned production.</p>
<p>(9) In order to increase Shanghai's industrial production, we must thoroughly solve the above problems and eliminate the above obstacles. The main thing is: 1. Improve the political environment and give producers psychological stability, and the main methods are: (A) Reduce production taxes and abolish heavy taxes and transit taxes. (B) Guarantee the acquisition of cheap raw materials and a full supply of power. (C) The government guarantees the principal and interest. (D) Limit freight rates, improve transportation and inspection methods. 2. Financially, do your best to provide industrial producers with financial assistance, especially rewarding medium and small industries and handicrafts. Industrial producers can form groups, and banks can provide loans to these groups to protect the interests of the banks. 3. The industrial circles should establish self-reliant organizations and then form an alliance of Sino-Japanese industrial producers, and under the guidance of the Sino-Japanese authorities, jointly seek rational development. 4. Prohibit speculation and huge profits, but support legitimate exchanges and stock markets to stabilize the market and encourage floating capital to be invested in production undertakings. (End)</p>
<h3>Sale of Oil in Various Joint Guarantee Districts of the French Concession Scheduled by Date and Time; Purchasing Households Should Comply with Regulations; Notice Issued in Advance by the Joint Guarantee Office</h3>
<p>The edible oil industry wholesale office has been distributing oil to households since the 3rd [of this month]. Each person receives four ounces at a price of two yuan, five jiao, and five fen. This oil sale is of a general nature, so edible oil households do not need to compete to be first. It is also understood that the wholesale office has divided the entire city into several areas. Therefore, the sales situation can be described as good. However, within the Xiafei Road area of the French Concession, due to procedural reasons, it was not possible to issue the oil at the same time. For example, the 148th Joint Guarantee, the 135th Joint Guarantee, the 147th Joint Guarantee, and the 196th Joint Guarantee, etc., have now scheduled dates and times. The Joint Guarantee Office will first instruct the Baozhong chiefs to notify each household. Residents of each Joint Guarantee should comply with the regulations and bring their household registration certificates, etc., to arrive on time so that the oil sales office can quickly complete its work.</p>
<p>Oil Quantity Should Be Accurate</p>
<p>This time, the two concessions stipulated that each person receives four ounces of oil, purchased by the head of the household for the total number of people in the household. Heads of three-tenant families can also go to ensure fair distribution. Regarding the quantity of oil, the authorities believe that the price of oil is already extremely high. Oil shops must ensure that every drop is accounted for and sell accurately without any deductions or adulteration. If households purchasing oil find that the quantity is insufficient, they can report it immediately. Inspectors will be dispatched for random checks. Those who are found to be colluding and engaging in fraud will be punished severely.</p>
<p>West Shanghai Distributing Coarse Rice and Xian Rice</p>
<p>West Shanghai is rationing grain according to population. The first distribution for March of this year has begun. This distribution has been increased by four He. Coarse rice accounts for three-quarters, and Xian rice accounts for slightly more than one-quarter. Each person receives one Sheng and seven He of coarse rice and six He of Xian rice, sold for a total of six yuan and nine jiao in national currency. As for the third distribution in March, namely the ninth ration of rice, the West Shanghai authorities have not yet set a date for distribution. Citizens are eagerly hoping that the West Shanghai grain administration will actively find ways to improve the situation to benefit the lives of the people.</p>
<p>Fourth Ration of Flour Starts Tomorrow</p>
<p>The purchase of flour for February of this year was only yesterday (the 4th) relayed by the district authorities to each Lian chief within the boundary to be distributed to citizens household by household. Therefore, the first count of flour rations for February, namely the fourth ration, is scheduled to begin tomorrow (the 6th). Each person receives one Jin of flour, sold for four yuan and four jiao in national currency. At that time, citizens can use their fourth ration purchase certificates to purchase flour from designated stores. Whether the fifth and sixth flour rations for February can be fully allocated within this month has not yet been decided. Regarding the city's count of four ounces of oil rations, sold for two yuan, five jiao, and five fen in national currency, the deadline is set for 5:00 PM on the 9th of this month.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was Children's Day</h3>
<p>To celebrate the 12th Children's Day, various circles in the city held a joint celebration meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at the Dahuigong Bridge at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 4th). More than 500 people attended, including Education Bureau Chief Lin Jiong'an, heads of various agencies, guests from all walks of life, and children from various schools. The presidium was composed of the Education Bureau, etc. After the meeting was conducted with due ceremony, Mayor Chen first delivered a speech, briefly stating the significance of celebrating Children's Day. The intent is to make children across the country understand that today is one of the most precious days for children, to make them aware of the greatness of their mission for the country in the future, and to promote people's love and respect for children. Children are the foundation of the country and the spirit of the nation. Therefore, we should reasonably educate and love children, so that children can obtain happiness, then the foundation of the country can be consolidated, and the nation can be revived. Otherwise, the country cannot exist, and the nation will be destroyed. Subsequently, representatives of the municipal government delivered speeches, and guests gave speeches. Then, representatives of child refugees delivered speeches. After the meeting read out a telegram of respect to the chairman, the meeting was adjourned. In the afternoon, the presidium of the meeting went to various refugee shelters in groups to distribute candy and biscuits. At 9:10 PM, Director Lin delivered a broadcast speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, titled "The Significance of Celebrating Children's Day." The Children's Day Infant Health Competition held the finals at the Nanshi Citizen Education Center at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and awarded prizes at that time.</p>
<p>Infant Competition Holds Awards Ceremony</p>
<p>The city's Infant Health Competition Awards Ceremony, sponsored by the Municipal Education Bureau, was held yesterday, the 12th Children's Day, at the Confucian Temple Park on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. It was personally awarded by Lin Jiong'an, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau. The ceremony was grand. At the same time, the Public Education Center held an amusement fair, and the situation was enthusiastic. It was found that a total of 233 people participated in this infant health competition. After separate reviews, the winners of the first group, from six months to one year old, included Yu Runxian, Zhuang Ximing, Diao Daren, Lin Weiguo, Zhang Linsen, Zhang Jiadong, Lu Jianye, and Xue Meimei. The second group, two years old, included six people: Tang Dexiang, Zhang Qingquan, Zhu Huanan, Lu Lin, Xu Fa, and Ma Bao. The third group included Ying Shichang, Deng Longlong, and He Xiying. The fourth group included Tang Lili, Gong Maomao, and Zhang Qingye, etc.</p>
<h3>Today, the City Holds Sacrificial Ceremony to Confucius</h3>
<p>The Confucius Sacrificial Ceremony has been stipulated by the Central Government that the Shi Dian sacrificial ceremony will be held every spring and autumn throughout the country. The Municipal Education Bureau of the Municipal Government has scheduled the spring Shi Dian sacrificial ceremony to be held at the Confucian Temple in Nanshi at 10:00 AM today. Mayor Chen Gongbo will personally preside over the sacrificial ceremony at that time. All agencies and schools will participate in the sacrificial ceremony.</p>
<h3>Improved Method for Purchasing Boat Tickets to Ningbo; Register First, Then Collect Tickets; Reward for Reporting High-Priced Resales</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of residents traveling from this port to Ningbo has been increasing day by day, leading to overcrowding when purchasing boat tickets. Cases of squeezing for tickets, high-priced resales, and needing to pay extra fares on board due to mismatched names have occurred. A reporter from the Datong News Agency specially visited the travel agency handling ticket sales yesterday to record the proper ticket purchase methods as follows:</p>
<p>Register First</p>
<p>Passengers traveling to Ningbo, regardless of the date, can bring their citizen certificates to the travel agency selling boat tickets for advance registration. After the ticket seller copies down the citizen certificate number and name and age, they will issue a "Ship Date Certificate." The reverse side of this certificate and the citizen certificate will have a joint stamp to facilitate verification. At the same time, the listed price will be collected. However, after receiving the "Ship Date Certificate," you must pay attention to the date for exchanging the boat ticket written on it to prevent it from being invalidated if it is out of date.</p>
<p>Reward for Reporting</p>
<p>Furthermore, this certificate may not be transferred to others. When exchanging for the boat ticket, the ticket seller must check whether the citizen certificate matches the registration. If there is a discrepancy, the ship date certificate will be confiscated. Therefore, the above methods are all based on verifiable records, so it is impossible to carry out high-priced resale techniques. If passengers purchase high-priced boat tickets outside and have evidence, they can bring the ticket to the company to report it. The company will investigate the fraudulent person and refund the boat ticket fee to the reporter, allowing them to return to their hometown.</p>
<h3>Picking Up Lost Money; Eagerly Hoping for Claim</h3>
<p>Mr. Weng Kairong of Lunzhong Weaving Factory picked up a stack of banknotes at the intersection of Henan Road and Guangdong Road yesterday. After waiting for a while and no one came to look for them, he immediately notified the self-defense corps at the intersection and handed over the original amount to the social service department of this newspaper. The loser can bring proper assurance within three days and come to this office to explain the time of the loss, the amount of money, and the number of bills. After everything matches, they will be allowed to reclaim the money. After the deadline, the money will be transferred to this newspaper's poverty relief fund to benefit the loser.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Public Works Bureau's Flood Prevention Committee's Public Works Group Meeting; Flood Prevention Project Imminent; Shantytowns Along Various Rivers to be Demolished Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau's Flood Prevention Committee, in order to dredge and prevent floods in areas such as Zhuanbang, Yongyuanbang, Xiaohebang, Loupu River, Zhuyuanbang, and No. 14 Bang in the Fahua Port area of West Shanghai (west of the railway) due to siltation of river flows, convened a public works group meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and recent work progress, and then discussed proposals. The resolutions are as follows: (1) With the flood prevention project imminent, the shantytowns along various rivers should be demolished within a time limit to facilitate public works. (2) The public works group should send a letter to the Municipal Police Headquarters and the West Shanghai Police Bureau, requesting each to send two police officers from their respective jurisdictions to assist personnel dispatched by the public works group in jointly handling the matter. (3) The Fahua Port area west of the railway belongs to the jurisdiction of the Yulin Road and Xujiahui sub-bureaus. A letter should be sent to request them to instruct their respective sub-bureaus to send police to assist. (4) Regarding the demolition costs of shantytowns in Fahua Port, etc., a preliminary budget should be prepared and submitted for approval and implementation. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Dapu Bridge Opens</h3>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, the bridges along Xujiahui Road, the border between the French and Chinese areas in the southern district, were closed. Only Fenglin Road remained open for pedestrian traffic. The remaining bridges had not been opened, and pedestrians had to detour through Xieqiao or Xujiahui and Fenglin Bridge. It is now learned that Dapu Bridge was opened at noon the day before yesterday, allowing vehicles and pedestrians to pass. At that time, officials from the Chinese, Japanese, and French sides attended the opening ceremony. Police officers from the Chinese and French police agencies were dispatched to inspect the pedestrians passing by.</p>
<h3>Customs Continues to Seize Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs recently, based on reports from various parties, continued to crack down on nine cases of smuggling and has imposed penalties according to law.

<h3>Sports; West League Football Group A Match; Donghua Lost Yesterday; Jewish Team Won 3-2</h3>
<p>In yesterday's West League Group A match, Donghua and the Jewish team met at Jiaozhou Park. The situation was enthusiastic. Donghua's strength was weakened due to the absence of key players Zhuang Youren, Xu Wenkui, and Liang Shutang, and they were also unlucky, leading to a defeat against the Jewish team. Forty-two minutes into the game, A. Daye received the ball in the middle and passed it low to Liao Shiming. Liao then lobbed it to A. Daye, who gently kicked it, breaking the opponent's goal first. The score was 1-0. However, in less than a minute, Fafanxiao rose up in the middle, dribbled quickly, and rushed to the penalty area. Zhang Banglun came out of the goal to save it but was beaten by Fafanxiao into the empty goal. The score was 1-1. Soon, the first half ended, and the score was tied 1-1. In the second half, Donghua lost two goals in a row, and the morale of the team was indignant. Jia Youliang launched an uprising on the side line, went deep into the penalty area, and lobbed it to the center. A. Daye headed the ball into the net, making the score 2-3. Until the end of the game, Donghua lost to the Jewish team.</p>

<h3>Readers' Forum; A Few Hopes for Nanshi</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ping</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Nanshi, studied in Nanshi. Except for five years of wandering in the concession during the August 13th Incident, I eventually returned to the embrace of Nanshi. Therefore, I love Nanshi and hope that Nanshi will recover sooner.</p>
<p>Living in Nanshi has the interest of finding tranquility in the midst of the hustle and bustle. Moreover, on the ancient buildings, one can reflect on everything in history, some of which are very poetic.</p>
<p>Of course, Nanshi has been greatly rectified and improved after the war, but I, who am overly hopeful, still feel that the authorities are not putting in enough effort.</p>
<p>(1) Roads: In terms of Zhonghua, Minguo, and Huancheng roads, there are many low-lying areas, and the streets in the city are also mostly dilapidated and sunken, which should be repaired as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Drains: The drains along the roads have not been dredged for a long time, resulting in water accumulation during rain and turning into channels of filth, which should be made smooth.</p>
<p>(3) Garbage: Newspapers have repeatedly reported on cleaning, but it has become a habit over time, and it is only transported to nearby open spaces for accumulation (such as the section from Xiaodongmen to Dadongmen, with piles like small mounds along the road), which should be thoroughly cleaned.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation: There used to be a ring road bus, which was suspended due to gasoline shortages. At least this line should be restored first - whether it is a tram or a charcoal car is fine.</p>
<p>(5) Urination and Defecation: The more dilapidated houses and open spaces there are, the easier it is to develop the bad habit of urinating and defecating at will. Considering that nature is right in front of us and the rampant true tiger epidemic last year, can the self-defense corps and post police work together to prohibit this?</p>
<p>Regarding the above, residents should first conduct self-examination and pay attention to public health, but because there are many ignorant people, we have to rely on the power of the authorities to investigate and ban.</p>
<p>With the French Concession about to be taken over, the iron gates can be completely abolished. The number of residents in Nanshi is increasing, and if we do not plan ahead, those who intend to move to Nanshi may be deterred.</p>
<p>The measures of the Grain Bureau are much better than before. Following the example of the concessions, rations can now be purchased on time, which is worth reporting to friends who want to come to Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Economic Circle</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week were generally stable as usual. However, because the Japanese military notes have stopped issuing new notes, the general public does not understand the truth, so they suspect the exchange problem of the Central Reserve Bank notes and the Joint Reserve Bank notes, which has caused various market conditions to fluctuate rapidly. However, except for the slightly higher prices of some goods, the market prices of food remain flat and sluggish. As for the officially set prices of gold ornaments, cotton yarn, cloth, fuel, miscellaneous grains, sugar, and oil, there has been no change so far.</p>
<h3>Commentary; The Problem of Rational Prices</h3>
<p>In handling any matter, it is necessary to adhere to scientific methods and rationalize as a principle. What is the current price problem? Opinions vary. The most fundamental solution is to investigate the raw materials, payment, and all reasonable profits of the factory and calculate a fair and just value. In that case, not only will black market prices not occur, but also the bad phenomenon of hoarding and not selling, resulting in priced but unavailable goods, will not be discovered. Therefore, factory cost accounting is a matter worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Running any kind of factory in difficult times is not easy to please. If the price is high, it will affect sales and even make wholesalers and retailers unwilling to promote sales. If the selling price is low, it will affect the capital. The solution lies in basing the price on the purchase price of raw materials, plus interest payments, and the due legal profits. Absolutely no concealment or intentional price increases should be allowed, causing prices to rise to unlimited levels. This is something that trade associations should pay attention to and strive to implement. If it is found that the limited price is below cost, the limited price should be raised to prevent the manufacturer from suffering excessive losses. In a word, the principle of price lies in stability, not too high, not too low, and changes should not be too rapid. Therefore, if all prices are based on scientific methods, it can be said to be the most reasonable, not only can both production and sales parties not suffer losses, but also their business can achieve a stable result.</p>
<h3>Various Authorities Effectively Rectify; Shanghai Industry and Commerce Gradually Get on the Right Track</h3>
<p>Various industries in this city, such as (1) cracking down on speculative transactions and preventing hoarding; (2) limiting spot transactions and strictly prohibiting buying and selling short; (3) negotiating standard prices and ordering all industries to comply; (4) formulating buying and selling industry regulations and earnestly implementing them, whether the company buys or sells spot or futures goods, are required to issue purchase and sale orders. Therefore, all industries have rules to follow for transactions, and various illegal activities and speculative hoarding seem to have gradually disappeared. The supply of goods is actively seeking to resume work. In the future, production and consumption are expected to be balanced. Social people's livelihood will become more stable from now on.</p>

This is to study the outline and policies of Japan's new economic policy toward China and discuss how to gather the total strength of various companies to revitalize China's industry, thereby cultivating strategic and combat capabilities.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Manufacturing Plant Established in Pudong</h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, it is learned that the relevant authorities in this city intend to establish a caustic soda manufacturing plant in Pudong in order to solve the difficulty of soap raw materials. The construction of the factory can begin this month. In the future, the raw materials for manufacturing soap in this city will have no fear, and the larger-scale soap factories of Chinese merchants can also resume work. The output of soap will increase, and the price of soap will also fall back.</p>
<h3>The Trends of Essential Goods</h3>
<p>Livestock</p>
<p>It is found that the Public Works Bureau limits the price of pork to 13 yuan and 8 jiao per catty, but merchants ignore the public order. The so-called limited price is just empty talk. In principle, general fish and meat foods have limited prices, but in fact they all exceed the limited prices. If we were to crack down on it today, then in tomorrow's meat shops, you wouldn't be able to buy a single piece of pork. However, economic control should be universal and uniform and cannot leave meat out of the equation.</p>
<p>So, what method should be used to control the price of meat? This still lies in thoroughly reforming the structure of the livestock market, that is, to change the current market that forms a free market price into a market under a controlled economy. The reform of the livestock market is imminent. It is said that the market authorities have already drafted a plan to reform the market structure. For the sake of detailed explanation of the current situation of the market structure and the purchase and distribution of livestock, here is a brief overview of the direction of reforming the market structure.</p>
<p>The livestock transported to Shanghai, both in the past and now, are mainly produced in Jiangbei, as are pigs and cattle. Only a few aquatic products and poultry are produced in Jiangnan. The products near Zhenjiang in the Taihu Lake area can be slightly more. For pigs alone, an average of 600,000 heads are transported to Shanghai every year from the three ports of Jiangbei: Xingang, Xinsheng, and Zhanghuang. The pork consumption of Shanghai citizens requires about 1 million to 1.2 million heads per year. This shows that more than half of Shanghai's annual consumption depends on the pigs from the three ports mentioned above. Xinsheng, Xingang, and Zhanghuang have become the center of the producing area market. Yellow cattle and water buffalo, a total of five or six thousand heads are transported from the above ports every year. Although it is not much, it already accounts for the first place in the north and south of the Yangtze River. As for chickens, ducks, wild ducks, etc., about five or six hundred thousand are transported from Xingang and Xinsheng to Shanghai every year. However, aquatic products and poultry are still richer in Jiangnan. Although the production in the Taihu Lake area has recently decreased, counting the chickens, ducks, and wild ducks from Xiashu Port in Zhenjiang West, about one million are transported to Shanghai every year. Livestock production around Shanghai is not prosperous. About 2,000 goats and 20,000 chickens come from Songjiang and Pudong. Animal husbandry is quite developed in Jiangbei. Looking at the production and sales map of livestock resources, it is such a situation that Jiangbei is the production area, and Jiangnan is the consumption area of livestock resources.</p>
<p>It is found that the central market's imports were not prosperous in the second half of last year, gradually decreasing compared with the first half of the same year and the second half of the previous year. The root cause of the surge in meat prices also lies in the smooth arrival of goods. The livestock that arrive are all traded by means of sale. Whether the sale method is suitable for the economic control system will be discussed later. Here, let's first talk about the distribution process from the market to the consumer:</p>
<p>The current meat distribution in Shanghai has to go through three stages: broker - meat merchant - retailer. However, large demands from large hotels and restaurants can be purchased directly from meat merchants, but the needs of ordinary people have to go through multiple twists and turns, and some merchants take advantage of this, creating a situation of rising prices step by step. In fact, controlling meat prices is not very troublesome. There is no need to consider in many ways like controlling industrial products. The focus of controlling meat prices lies in reforming the pricing mechanism of the central market. Sale is a remnant of liberalism, and it should not be allowed to exist anymore. The problem is to eliminate this long-standing malpractice.</p>
<p>The upper and lower livestock markets are already planning a reform draft, and Shanghai's meat prices will soon return to normal. (March 22nd, Mainland New Daily)</p>

<h3>Remembering My Hometown</h3>
<p>— Hu Mingyang</p>
<p>Having been away from my hometown for five years, the village houses and the streams are inevitably a bit hazy in my imagination now. Yet, I unconsciously feel an infinite longing for everything about her. I remember the year I turned thirteen, I embarked on a long journey in a sudden mood, gently leaving my lovely hometown behind. At that time, I never looked back or felt any reluctance because, sadly, I didn’t understand such feelings then. But time has taken away the past, and the years have silently faded into that turbulent life, making me deeply admire and yearn for everything of the past. So, sometimes when I happen to think of the old days’ laughter, I am reminded of my beautiful hometown. I dream that I have grown two wings, flying over the wilderness, and throwing myself into her embrace again.</p>
<p>My hometown is in Haiyan County, Zhejiang, a village belonging to Tongyuan Town. Almost all the residents there are brothers, uncles, and cousins from the same clan. A stream meanders in front of the village, and fields surround it. Therefore, whenever spring fills the earth, the surroundings are all shades of green, as if living in a jade city. And especially during dusk, the sky is scattered with red clouds, which, from a distance, seem to connect with the green fields. Flocks of birds fly in from the horizon, suddenly sweeping across the fields and streams, heading straight for their nests. At this moment, one can often see elderly people holding a pipe, slowly returning from the field paths. They casually sit on the bluestones outside their doors, letting the evening breeze brush their beards, peacefully smoking their pipes. The muscles on their faces are so relaxed, always with a slight smile. At that time, we children would go and ask them to tell stories. Of course, what we loved to hear most were *Investiture of the Gods* and *Journey to the West*. Sometimes, when we got excited listening, we might even grab a wooden stick and call ourselves the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</p>
<p>At that time, the men, women, old, and young of my hometown were immersed in the wine of joy, not knowing what sorrow was. Although they were working all day long, everyone was happy. After dinner, everyone gathered together, the elders talking about their daily lives, while the children played freely, unrestrained, just like birds flying in the sky.</p>
<p>But that beautiful life passed quickly. When I was thirteen, everything in my hometown suddenly changed. I couldn't see the smiling faces of my uncles and cousins, nor could I hear the exciting stories—*Investiture of the Gods* and *Journey to the West*. I only saw that everyone's face revealed a kind of tension. Before long, everyone was infected, and I myself unconsciously felt uneasy. Later, I left my hometown and embarked on that long journey, and five years have passed in the blink of an eye. I deeply long for the stream in the village, the setting sun at the corner of the house, the birds by the edge of the field, and the fragrance of rapeseed flowers in May. I hope I can relive that intoxicating life. But I don't know when I will be able to return to my beloved hometown.</p>
<h3>A Brief Biography of the Foolish Old Man</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhong</p>
<p>In智 Village lived a Foolish Old Man (愚翁), because he never told anyone his name. Even if you asked him, he would only say, "Haha! I've forgotten." So, people assumed his surname was Foolish from his actions and assumed his given name was Old Man from his age. Even the word "Old Man" was not necessarily a term of respect, because in the group of wise people, this word often carried a satirical meaning.</p>
<p>The Foolish Old Man’s home only consisted of a dilapidated hut and a patch of empty ground. He had no family or friends. Every day, besides his own work, he did what people called the foolish thing of making stone mortars.</p>
<p>智 Village was full of智 Elder, 智 Grandma, 智 Husband, 智 Wife, 智 Older Sister, 智 Younger Sister, 智 Older Brother, 智 Younger Brother... there were quite a few of them. The Foolish Old Man lived among them, making him seem even more foolish and clumsy.</p>
<p>One day, someone discovered that a small corner of the riverbank outside the village had been washed away. This was a well-known thing, so they went to report it to the 智 Village Chief. The智 Village Chief immediately gathered all the 智 Villagers to discuss repair measures. The Foolish Old Man knew about this and was very anxious, but he was not qualified to participate, so he wandered outside the 智 Village Chief's house, hoping that they would come up with a good solution inside.</p>
<p>The sun had already set, and all the 智 Villagers poured out of the house, saying that this matter would have to be discussed further tomorrow.</p>
<p>The moonlight was hazy, and the early spring evening breeze made people feel a bit chilly. 智 Village was asleep quietly, without any sound. On the village street, an old man carried a load on his shoulders, moving forward with heavy steps. He was the Foolish Old Man.</p>
<p>He walked to the riverbank about half a kilometer away, found the damaged corner, and began his foolish work.</p>
<p>The next day, a 智 Husband walked past the riverbank and saw that the washed-out corner had been repaired. His wisdom sparked, and he immediately ran back to the village, shouting to the villagers:</p>
<p>"You can live and work in peace now! I have already repaired the riverbank."</p>
<p>The Foolish Old Man also jumped out and shouted to the villagers:</p>
<p>"Let's celebrate! Our Wise 智 has repaired the riverbank and saved our whole village."</p>
<p>He shouted hoarsely, and finally collapsed to the ground due to excessive excitement.</p>
<p>The 智 Villagers embraced the 智 Husband who had repaired the riverbank and jumped and cheered. This 智 Husband later received a bonus from the 智 Village Chief.</p>
<p>The 智 Village no longer saw the Foolish Old Man’s trace. The 智 Villagers clapped their hands and celebrated, and the 智 Village washed away—a stain.</p>
<h3>Crude Shouts</h3>
<p>— Shi Ting</p>
<p>No poems, no essays,</p>
<p>Not even able to recite poetry,</p>
<p>I was originally a warrior,</p>
<p>Not a poet;</p>
<p>All along, I only knew how to clench my sword and make straightforward scoldings,</p>
<p>Crude struggles,</p>
<p>Now, the battle between light and darkness,</p>
<p>Has revealed the hidden side of reality,</p>
<p>Everything is bloody,</p>
<p>And so obvious.</p>
<p>I cannot help but feel in my soul,</p>
<p>A heavy burden,</p>
<p>Intense hatred,</p>
<p>Surging love,</p>
<p>Plucking at the strings of my heart,</p>
<p>Finally, unconsciously, I picked up a pen,</p>
<p>I will imitate the mountain wind's roar,</p>
<p>Shaking that gloomy pine forest;</p>
<p>Like surging waves,</p>
<p>Crashing against the firmly built embankment.</p>
<p>However, I began to doubt again,</p>
<p>Wandering without a place to stand,</p>
<p>Dad's bloodshot eyes,</p>
<p>Mom's withered face,</p>
<p>I dare not portray,</p>
<p>This is just a personal annoyance,</p>
<p>Reality bestows upon us,</p>
<p>Annoyance and pain,</p>
<p>Is more than just this,</p>
<p>Will be a million times more serious.</p>
<p>I still pity those abandoned bones,</p>
<p>In the dark corners of walls,</p>
<p>And the gray rats,</p>
<p>But I don't want to beg for them,</p>
<p>I know,</p>
<p>They are no weaker than me,</p>
<p>To be slaughtered and cut,</p>
<p>The slaves have already risen,</p>
<p>They have a bright future.</p>
<p>As for, dancing on piles of skulls,</p>
<p>Chewing human flesh,</p>
<p>Drinking human blood,</p>
<p>A group,</p>
<p>There is no need to announce their fate,</p>
<p>Dawn is already sparkling in the East,</p>
<p>The God of Love has also sown,</p>
<p>Righteous, sacred flowers,</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>When the devils disappear from the world,</p>
<p>Along with power and brutality,</p>
<p>Will it still be far away?</p>
<p>Across my eyes,</p>
<p>Is still a blank sheet of paper,</p>
<p>No poems, no essays,</p>
<p>I was originally a warrior,</p>
<p>Not a poet;</p>
<p>The Creator long ago wrote for us,</p>
<p>Brilliant poems,</p>
<p>I will still clench my sword,</p>
<p>And make straightforward scoldings,</p>
<p>Crude struggles!</p>
<p>Facing reality directly,</p>
<p>The dark side!</p>
<h3>Thoughts and Opinions</h3>
<p>— Xiao Luo</p>
<p>Every day, I read the articles in the newspaper supplements and the creations in the magazines, and I always feel that many of them are monotonous love novels and utopian ideals that are divorced from reality. Of course, there are also many good articles, which is undeniable. But I always think that the cultural circles in Shanghai are generally too depressed.</p>
<p>"Literature and art have a close relationship with the times," is the first sentence in this publication's announcement. This "literature and art" of course does not refer to the two types mentioned above. Since literature and art have a close relationship with the times, then at least it must maintain a good connection with this era. The pen tip of a cultural person should be a sharp sword, which will portray the good and evil, the division between light and darkness, and leave a shadow for this turbulent era.</p>
<p>I feel that our articles must pay attention to these points:</p>
<p>It should be practical, not something that is imagined out of thin air, but a record of actual life that one has personally observed and experienced.</p>
<p>Efforts should be made to strive for popularization, and the level of the article should take into account readers with low levels of education.</p>
<p>More descriptions should be given to the realities of lower-class society, such as the various situations of workers, apprentices, dock workers, rickshaw pullers, etc. in factories. We should fully understand their personal sufferings under the persecution of the old society and the high pressure of life to arouse people's attention and sympathy.</p>
<p>It should be full of vigor and not be pessimistic or depressed.</p>
<p>It should be lively, and one should not be afraid to write everything that is being suppressed, like being afraid of threats and taking into account face-saving, etc.</p>
<p>Sincerely and frankly, I offer the above points of view, hoping that friends can provide supplements and corrections.</p>
<h3>Falling Flowers —Dedicated to Nanny Nan—</h3>
<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>It's the season of falling flowers again!</p>
<p>Petals flutter down one by one with the breeze,</p>
<p>I lean against the tree trunk,</p>
<p>Contemplating past events.</p>
<p>It was also the season of falling flowers,</p>
<p>I held your little hand and strolled along the lake,</p>
<p>You smiled and said, "How fun, sister! I wish I could fly too, like falling flowers."</p>
<p>Seeing the petals on the trees by the lake fluttering down,</p>
<p>Having just left turbulent Shanghai, you fell ill,</p>
<p>The local doctor shook his head and left your ward, but you smiled and said:</p>
<p>"Sister! I dreamed that I flew! Flew! Flew into that clear lake, even though it's a winter without falling flowers."</p>
<p>"Sister! Don't cry, you'll scare away the flower fairies accompanying me."</p>
<p>You actually left, with a smile, completely disregarding your beloved sister,</p>
<p>Just like your favorite falling flowers, you flew away, only spending a short, beautiful time.</p>
<p>It's the season of falling flowers again,</p>
<p>Petals flutter down one by one with the breeze,</p>
<p>I lean against the tree trunk,</p>
<p>Contemplating past events.</p>
<h3>In the Boat</h3>
<p>— Lu Yan</p>
<p>One year after the incident, on a deep winter evening, I followed the wriggling crowd and squeezed into the small steamboat docked in the Huangpu River. In the dark lower cabin, I found the reserved berth, put down my luggage, and leaned on the bow, casting a final glance at the city where I had lived for so long with a faint, lingering feeling. Gentlemen and ladies were happily enjoying their sumptuous Christmas dinner.</p>
<p>As the blurred outlines of the towering buildings completely disappeared into the darkness, the small steamboat gradually increased its speed, heading into the high tide of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>This is the only small steamer currently sailing along the Zhejiang coast. The passengers are very crowded, especially in the lower cabin, where even the corners for stacking goods are full of people lying down. There are merchants transporting goods, wanderers returning home, petty politicians, workers, students, young men and women who are infatuated with the War of Resistance…</p>
<p>Although the ship had already set sail, people were still making a lot of noise, as if they could never finish talking. The cabin was already dark, and coupled with the smoke and water vapor exhaled by people, a small five-candlepower electric light was even weaker, emitting a yellow glow.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Such a small boat! This is my first time riding one! It's really killing me…" The old man, leaning against the berth and sipping green bean wine, took a bite of braised pork, shaking his shiny bald head, speaking with a sound like a missing front tooth.</p>
<p>"It's re… really the only way… e… extraordinary times! Old… Old man: Where are you going—going home?" A thin man lying on the upper berth spoke with his eyes always flashing, even the muscles on his cheeks twitching, looking like he was making a face at you.</p>
<p>"Ugh, me? To Zhenhai!" The old man put a piece of braised pork in his mouth, speaking with half a nasal sound.</p>
<p>"Hey! Let me tell you, in the past, no one would ride this boat even if it was free! I remember it was three years ago, right? Uh! No, it was before the war. The comprador of this boat didn't want the water money and wanted us to load goods, and we were still afraid it wasn't stable!" A young man leaning against the door and aimlessly tapping the bulkhead, looking like a shop clerk, also chimed in.</p>
<p>"It's re… really the only way! But there's no other boat, Old Li! What about 雷…雷斯… is it open?"</p>
<p>"The 克雷斯汀, I heard it's going to resume sailing!"</p>
<p>"That's right! 克…雷雷期汀, that boat is really good! It's a iron mast!" The man kept flashing his eyes.</p>
<p>"I heard that the route from Shipu to Ningbo is not very safe?" The person who said this was a sixteen or seventeen-year-old child, constantly looking at everyone's faces, waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>"Ugh, yes! That's where the problem happened last time!" The old man picked up another piece of braised pork, glancing at the child.</p>
<p>"It's re… really the only way! Extraordinary… times! Getting up early to ride a sedan chair means leaving early!" When the thin man said this, his eyes flashed even more fiercely, and his face and mouth twitched rhythmically. The child looked at him and wanted to laugh but tried hard not to.</p>
<p>"Hey! I say! It's better to take a sailing boat! With water police following!" The young man leaning against the door yawned, still tapping the cabin board with his hand.</p>
<p>"Ugh, sailing boats aren't stable either. They sail at night without lights, and they often can't see boats coming from the opposite direction. Sometimes the water police themselves start shooting each other!" The old man had braised pork in his mouth again.</p>
<p>"Then! What if this route can't be taken?" The child who had asked the question earlier looked at the crowd with doubtful eyes, obviously their words had not satisfied him.</p>
<p>"That's not true, you still have to go. But, but it's always better to have water police following!" The young man leaning against the door had already climbed onto the berth and was smoking leisurely.</p>
<p>"Forget it! Water police, water police, they run faster than anyone when they see bandits, afraid that their guns will be confiscated! Last time I specially asked them to protect my family early in the morning, but they refused to go!" A man in a suit sitting on a small table on the deck suddenly shouted angrily, and everyone's eyes were focused on him.</p>
<p>"So, I say in these times, it's best not to go out if there's nothing important. If you have to go out, you're bound to take risks and suffer. For example, every time our ship is about to reach Shipu, the lights are turned off because there's a big pirate den outside Xiangshan Port, and they often intercept and chase merchant ships. It's even more dangerous if they anchor outside the port at night!" A man who looked like a ship's steward said with a lot of experience. From his face, which was weathered and full of wrinkles, it could be seen that he was an old seafarer.</p>
<p>Re… really the only way! Re… only way…</p>
<p>"Bang!"</p>
<p>In the darkest corner of the cabin, someone dropped something on the ground, and everyone's eyes looked over at the same time.</p>
<p>"No! No! You old hag! This is not a charity organization, this is a 'foreign' merchant ship!" The crew member wearing a white hat shouted angrily, saying the word "foreign" especially loudly.</p>
<p>"Good sir, do a good deed! I really don't have any money! My son was killed on the battlefield! I am a homeless, miserable old woman, I beg: I beg you to do a good deed… let me…"</p>
<p>"It's really annoying! The ticket costs forty yuan, how can you do it with only ten yuan? And you still have to eat!"</p>
<p>"Great sir! I beg you to do a good deed! Take me to the countryside! Please have mercy on this poor old woman!" A white-haired old woman knelt on the cabin board, crying and begging the crew member. Her voice was trembling, and a rice bowl was broken on the ground, and rice was scattered all over the place.</p>
<p>"Ugh, it's really pitiful! People are all suffering from the war! Sigh!" The old man sighed and put the last piece of braised pork in his mouth. He had already finished drinking the wine.</p>
<p>The ship's speed was getting faster and faster, and the ship was constantly shaking due to the impact of the waves. The cabin was temporarily silent, and everyone squeezed into their bedding.</p>
<p>I don't know when the electric lights in the cabin went out, and people started making a lot of noise again. Men were calling for the steward, children were crying, women were cursing, it was a mess.</p>
<p>"Steward, what's going on? Did the electric lights break?" The old man shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Old man!" The sixteen or seventeen-year-old child who had been sleeping soundly was also awakened, but the old man ignored him and just anxiously pounded on the bunk board.</p>
<p>"Coming! Sir! Don't make noise! There's a ship behind us……"</p>
<p>"It's re… really the only way… I'm af… afraid it's… pi… pirate…" The thin man also woke up, because there was no light, no one could see if he was blinking his eyes.</p>
<p>Everyone opened their eyes and lay on the bed without saying a word, their hearts beating non-stop. Silence dominated the entire cabin until the electric lights came on again, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and the coarse snoring started up again.</p>
