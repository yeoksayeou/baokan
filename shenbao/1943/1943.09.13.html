<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論今後之江蘇省政</h3>
<p>自從國民政府還都以後，一般人的視綫，都集注於中央政府的政治措施，而忽視地方政府的政治措施。這種覜念的形成，據我們的觀察，一部分由於主觀上的錯覺，認爲中央是主，地方是輔，中央政治辦好，地方政治也會辦好。一部分山於客觀上的錯覺，因爲世界局勢不斷的在緊張中演變，應付這種緊張局勢，是中央政府的責任，大家只注意了中央的動態。然而，實際上中央與地方有着唇與齒的關係，有着整個不可晚節的關係，所以，中央政府的政令，地方政府須切實的協力推行，才能獲致政令的效用。如果地方政府不能協力推行中央政令，或竟獨斷獨行背道而馳，那末，其結果紊亂系統，政令不能實施。因此，我們對於地方政府的政治措施，應與中央政府的政洽措施等量齊覜，同樣重視的。</p>
<p>我們日前申論今後的江蘇省政，很誠懇的指出過去種種弱點，希望今後竭力矯正，這種弱點的存在，固然政府應負其責任，可是，我們人民的視綫集注於中央，而忽視地方？因之未能隨時隨地督促改善，也是不可推卸的缺點。</p>
<p>現在江蘇省長，已由國府特任陳羣氏繼任，深信必有一新面目的設施，以慰羣望。我們盼望中央與地方的施政，一元化而不致脫節，同時，更警醒大家對於地方政治同樣的重視。陳羣氏歷久服官，政治經騐豐富，今由內政部長轉任地方長官，在理想上更能駕輕就熟。對於中央與地方政治推行之間，利弊得失，個中關鍵，自是洞若觀火，成竹在胸。但是，我們爲了迫於改善今後蘇政的情緒，再於日前提出的幾點意見，重覆指陳如次：</p>
<p>首先，我們强調用人問題的重要。因爲目前中國政治，不諱言的，尙未確立法治的基礎，公務人員的才幹與廉潔，依然是政治良好的最大因素。所以，今後省府的人事，應以「唯才主義」爲銓衡標準。對於原有人員應予甄別，依照標準，分別保智與淘汰。對於新進人員，不存地域觀念，　除官僚習氣，重視朝氣精神。</p>
<p>其次，爲政不在多言，地方政治以推行中央政令爲中心，以實事求是爲耍務。人民最需要實惠的德政，決不是高談政綱，闊論目標等好聽的遠景。盼望當政者能抓住這一民衆心理，切實做去。</p>
<p>再次，江南雖爲產米地區，而蘇省人民仍以糧食不敷最感痛苦，如何完成增加糧食生產的目的，减少蘇人痛苦，應爲今後德政的第一聲，願鄭重圖之。</p>
<p>江蘇是國都所在，是東方著名商埠所在，是全國經濟文化的重心，是於全國政治發生模範作用，是和平區內最重要的一省區，在此省府改組之時，趁此機緣，徹底刷新政治，以擔負重大的使命！</p>
<h3>歐戰第五年　各國內外情勢的檢討（二）</h3>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>此次歐洲大戰勃發時，蘇聯和德國　手，不參與交戰國任何一方，維持中立·立於戰爭的漩渦外。</p>
<p>戰後問題　蘇聯有份</p>
<p>歐戰開始後，德國席　波蘭東半部，卡勒利亞魚波羅的海沿岸三　　　薩劇比亞，普果維那等。距今二十六個月前，德蘇開戰·在綿廷三千公里長的戰綫上，展開了有史以來空前的大陸攻防戰，蘇聯獨當德軍的銳錄，成爲歐戰中的主要角色，而英國則趁此時機獲得喘息復蘇的機會。且間接投助美國遂有歐洲作戰者也就是　蘇聯的　戰力。從這觀點出發，目前蘇聯一面在全部　錢出以攻勢，一而然使便利戰時的　行起見，要求立即開闢第二戰綫，並非是無理的請求。但去年五月的蘇央條約；六月的蘇突條約的公　上，雖約定在一九四二年中向歐陸　　對德第二戰綫，英　竟食　　不果行。又水年一月的卡　勃朗加會　，亦曾決定有　年九月前擬　　第二戰綫，但直至今日，迄未　出　威　德軍後方的任何新　綫</p>
<p>第二戰線　望眼欲穿</p>
<p>和這第二戰綫問題同　注意者，即蘇聯最近的發言中所常提及的戰後問題。英美方面所主張的戰後問題，決非蘇聯的戰筏計劃之凡體表　，例如近來眞理報　　米尼林在「戰爭與勞働階級」雜　上所發表的「論戰爭目的」一文，對戰後問鳴蘭明蘇聯的態度·米尼林稱「我們並無戰爭目的，雖然如此了但一部分英美人士討論戰爭目的，並以之與戰後問題相提並　，假使要提起戰後間題，那麼占地球六分之一的蘇聯。當然聽該參加。」他殺然表示蘇聯對於東南歐、包括巴爾幹在內的獨自見解。這種言論的方向，再參將第二戰綫的要求時，可充分窺如蘇聯在今後戰局的展開上所懷的企圖。（翔：　自九月一日西部每日　聞）</p>
<h3>義軍二十餘萬人已完全解除武裝　戰艦「羅馬」號被德機炸沉</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　義大利本國內，迄今已有二十萬人以上放下武器·在希臘及東南歐其他各區義軍分遣隊尙未包括在內，至義軍加入德軍之人數尙不能發表·義大利本部及東南歐義軍自願受德軍司令部之支配者·爲數日增，據縝密之估計，迄今至少已有二十五至三十聯隊與不少特派隊、包括傘兵，高射砲防軍與摩托化部隊等及其各軍官等。各港內義軍　若干艘之人員，亦自願受德軍當局之支配。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　北非反軸心軍司令部頃承認，義戰艦「羅馬」號（三萬五千噸）今日企圖逃往馬爾太時，被德機擊沉。按該艦爲一九三八年九月十三日所建，於此次歌戰勃發後始竣工·爲最新銳之戰艦，保有十五吋主砲九門，三·五吋高射砲十二門，載飛機三架，船員一千六百名。</p>
<p>阿合西勒十一日中央社電　西班牙新聞　訊：至十一日下午止，直布羅陀港中未見有義大利兵艦及商船。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　海通社軍事記者塞托留斯稱：義巴特里奥政府投降敵後，義境德軍·乃發生兩重任務，一方面須解除義軍之武裝，活動範圍遍及義國全境，如遇義軍反抗，更須於激戰後克服之，一方面更須應傳在南部登陸之英美軍，並須及時佔領沿海地帶，以防敵軍　在義中北部登陸，過去二十四小時內之經過，可證德軍巳能把握局勢，解除義軍武裝之工作，大部份巳完成，不久當可全部結束。米蘭·羅馬等地實力有一軍團以上之防軍，巳均投條德軍、波拉，熱內亞，史貝齊亞以及李齊安、地拉尼安，阿特里亞特伐爾等要地，亦均入德軍之手，同時。德後衛部隊阻止加拉布里亞英第八軍前鋒之推進已取成効，泰倫吐灣登陸之英美部隊，經德軍迎戰，其行動已受阻碍，同時，德軍凱塞林上將部下之一部份軍隊，已開始進攻，在蘇列諾灣登陸之美第五軍，戰况激烈，不亞於北非及西西里之戰。協約方面巳將原　駛往他處另行登陸之運輪船隊，調至　列諾灣助戰，泰倫吐灣及阿布利亞西岸敵軍續有登陸，大約敵軍將先佔得阿布利亞，以爲進攻巴爾幹之跳板，該處之敵軍是否爲美第七軍生力軍，抑以英軍爲主，現尚不得而知·現悉英第八軍之主力·乃係以加拉布里亞北部爲根據，沿西岸向薩列諾灣　進，乃一股敵軍則擬向泰倫吐進發，敵前錄與德後衛。有接能，大致而論敵方巳　棄三日前保持主力之原來計劃，今巳擬儘量在義南部從事登陸·至於德軍之巳　敵接觸者，僅少數部隊，凱塞林上將及羅美爾上將之主力，刻正忙於解除義軍之武裝，此項任務即將完成，故日內或將　開大戰。</p>
<h3>羅美爾準備　堅強抗戰</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　北義德軍指揮羅美爾將軍，正在北部義大利以作抵抗計劃雨即將平靜，現敵人仍　用其坦克，飛機及其偉大之戰爭機構，將遇到堅強之抵抗。</p>
<h3>谷萩部長　發表談話</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電</p>
<p>日大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩少將，十一日就義國巴特里奥政權之投降英美事發表談話，其大意謂：「英美之世界政策，在犧牲其他民放，以求自身之安樂、傍　　蚌相爭，坐收漁翁之利、乃彼等之金科玉律；故於東亞唆使中日兩國相戰，於歐洲挑撥德　兩國　鬥。對阻碍彼等制　世界政策之國家，用種種方策，消耗其國力，以促其筋疲力盡，在中國於國民政府還都以後，猶支持渝方，在歐洲則支持法國波蘭及希臘等亡命政府、此次對義大利亦進行此種陰謀。樹立巴特里奧政權，凡此均爲最顯著之例。故此次意大利政變後，巴特里奧政權之投降·亦係英美謀略所致。猶憶一九一八年第一次犬戰末期，英美大作謀略宣傳，按之英美宣傳，可分五個階段·啓衆宣傅，有望宣傅，傾軋對立宣傅及引起革命宣傅等，此次對於義大利亦重施其　有之手段，使義人感覺絕望，　成厭戰心情並鼓動義人打倒墨索里尼及法西斯，即可獲得和平，迄於最近乃強迫義國無條件投降，致有巴特里奧內閣背信行爲之發生，違反三國同盟及不單獨　和條約，對英美停止戰爭並對德國採取敵對行爲，此實爲人神所不許。凡我東亞人，無不認巴特里奧一派，乃因受戰禍威脅而患神經衰弱病及精神病者，彼等已在義國光榮之歷史上　留下汚穢之一點，並使彼等同胞。昨日所流之血空流。巴特里奥內閣之無條件投降，實令人唾乘。然德國對此，早巳測知而採取萬全之措置，因巴特里奧政權倒戈後，德國在政略及戰略上，已减輕相當負担·今後對英美作戰，當可充分發抓其力量。然以重慶而言，今爲應付內外情勢縱即停止抗戰，絕不能與巴特里奥政權之無條件投降同日而語，蓋渝方抗戰目的已由國民政府爲之實現。良以在渝方抗戰六年中。注主席已承繼孫文先生之遺志，取消不平等條約，中國所企求之獨立及自由巳形實現，今日所餘者，僅大東亞及國家各民族共同協力建設新東亞一事，故重慶亟應從速參加此廿世紀之偉大事業，共同建設東亞。</p>
<h3>視察廣州情況　褚外長談話</h3>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　行政院外交部長褚民誼氏爲視察粵省情况，於九日由京幾粵。常日下午抵省，十二日下午二時半，在中日文協分會接見巾日記者，就記者提出之間題，分別解答。茲錄大意如下：廣東為革命策源地、黨政軍各方而工作同志均異常緊張。各方均有長足之發展。本人在京時巳有　聞、此蓋由於陳省長以下各位之努力，暨友邦各方　協力之所致，故於政治經濟文化等各方面。均有良好之成績。本人此次來粵雖僅三日，見聞所及，深感較前次來粵時巳大有進步，茲粽合各位提出之問題，答覆知次：　關於義巴特利奥內閣投降英美事，自七月下旬墨索里尼首相辭職後，吾人即已料及義巴特利奥內閣於三週至五週間必將背叛。當時巴特里奥雖聲明仍繼續抗戰·不過爲準備投降工作而已。此次巴特里奧之叛變·與第一次世界大戰時義國情形相同，不足重視，於大局亳無影響。同時義法西斯政府亦巳於北義正式成立，法西斯黨知名之士，仍將繼續爲義國生存而努力，殊感欣慰。　淸鄉工作現已進入第三年，最初淸鄉工作開始在蘇省推行，國府設立淸鄉委員會辦理一切，由李士　氏任秘書長，故李氏對淸鄉工作貢獻頗大，此次病故，不勝悼惜。嗣後淸鄉區城擴大及於浙江上海各地，本年淸鄉機　改　仃政院，淸鄕工作益見强化、民生安定，治安確保，民衆亦得以安居樂業。現在淸鄕工作繼續　行·區域亦將更，擴大。　新國民運動，現已由理論宣傳進血爲　踐·各地靑少年軍動，及增產運動甚爲活　，尤以廣東方面成續最佳。本人在京時即巳　悉·各學校對於靑少年之訓練，可謂爲仝國之校範，於此大東亞戰爭中，靑少年之訓練，實爲異常重要之工作。　增產運動各地當局均努力推行，成續亦頗良好，故於國府參戰以來，因新運之推打與實施，我國之人力物力，均較前强大，以此協力大東亞戰爭，大東亞戰爭必能早日完成，</p>

<h3>義巴閣投降事　泰緬發表聲明</h3>
<p>盤谷十二日中央社電　畢本首相十一日晚廣播，題爲「關於義國之感想」，要旨如次：余對義國人民之不幸，極表同情，此次義國之崩潰，實由於義國人民缺乏團結心所致，因此義國內途成爲德與英美，德與義，　至　國同胞間互相慘殺之戰塲，泰國人民實應團結作戰，克服所有困難及敵方之謀略，而絕對信組指導者與政府，向最後勝利利之遂邁進。</p>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　緬甸政府十一日召開特別閣議，巴莫總理以下各閣僚全體出席，就義大利之情勢加以檢討，當日下午並發表聲明如次：「意大利巴特里奧政權無條件投降英美後·對緬甸國民最後勝利之信念，亳無任何影　。於此大戰爭中。形勢時有變化，乃所必然，但根本精神與物質之　備，乃　爲　需之要索·此實即決定最後勝負之要項。緬甸即根據此德理念，與日·德及其他同盟國共同作戰。蓋　有勝利始能保全吾等之存在，國家不能存在，則其他一切盡化爲島有。最後吾等對於此嚴重時局，支援緬甸獨立之日本，決盡忠誠，舉力以　，同時爲達成吾人共同之戰爭目的，　盡力一塲協到底。</p>

<h3>嚴重的買書問題</h3>
<p>— 嗷嗷</p>
<p>申新兩報熱心　理助學運動、減輕了多少清貧家長的重負，業解除了多少失學子弟的苦痛。</p>
<p>學費是有了着落了，但是讀書而沒有書，還是不行的。雖則書的問題簡單的多了，照例也不成爲問題，但是事實確未必盡然。</p>
<p>過去的事我們不談，書費比從前高了幾倍。暫且也不管，眼前値得密切注意的，便是九月二日的加了一倍的事件。</p>
<p>書業權威的某印書館和執翻版業牛耳的某書店等竟自九月二日起實行相當驚人的全部敎科　「倍價』，雖則白報紙印書打了個七折，但據傳這一個七折還是　時的「優待」，不久以後便得「　不七折」了，無論如何意林紙等書籍，一倍是漲定的了</p>
<p>自從紗布收買實以施來，一切物價都趨向下游，確是事實，白報紙等紙張，似也還照着限價，並沒漲價，要說是爲了印刷裝訂等的原故而倍價，看來也並沒有充分的理由吧！</p>
<p>十元一本　如今便得二十元，五十元一本書便得一百元，一學期本來要買五百元書，如果在九月二日買便得一千元，要說是一天之內有　驚人劇變還算是合法利潤的話，那末除了欽佩他們從前的不惜犧牲以外確也沒話可說了。</p>
<p>不過話似乎又應該說囘來了，淸寒學生還　他們一個九折的特別優待呢，但是這一個九折是怎樣打法的？加一倍打九折不是等於加上八成嗎？</p>
<p>書店雖沒有負着敎育的直接責任，自然不能與學校相提並論，也不能和處置「學店」的辦法同樣辦理，但是無論如何總該是文化事業的一份子，複雜的文化事業的盛衰，顯然和這一環有着相當重要的關係，那末自然也不能純粹以管利爲目的。讀書決不是娛樂，書本也決不是化裝品或奢侈品，學生更不是營利的對象，爲了獲得精神上的食糧似乎不該受如此的剝削的吧。</p>
<p>我們相信書業中不乏有識之士，更不乏在教育界文化界負有極　聲望的人，很希望能自動地減抑售價，我們更切盼當局於白忙中分一部份力量來加以糾正，我們也希望社會人士加以嚴密的監視，雖則自身並沒有直接的利害關係，但親友子弟多少總有讀書而需要買書的。我們相信　力的督促和注視，一切崎形的不合理的現象都會銷滅的。</p>
<h3>捲烟漲價後　利潤提高　軋買人數亦減少</h3>
<p>泰晤士報云：自九月九日起，華中烟草配給組合將配給捲烟價格遍增後，各烟兌店於每晨出售配給捲烟時。門前之軋買行列，幾已完全消失。同時捲烟黑市活動，亦已减少。形響所及，固定市價之辦法，亦得收效果。據衆晤士報記者，調査各零售烟店對於大前門，美麗牌。以及老刀牌等捲烟，獲得頗多。同時因派貨增多，國貨無可居奇。限價提高後，批發商利潤已由百分之五增至百分之七、零售商利潤，亦已由百分之十五增至百分之二十。</p>
<h3>申報致工商界函</h3>
<p>工商界公鑒：上海工商事業，向稱繁盛，　昔坊間有徵信名錄等類專編出版，檢閱稱便。近年頗多新創與變更，惟尙缺乏詳盡調查，系統紀錄，且因紙貴工高，尙少新本刊行，檢查參攷，均感不便。敵報有鑒於斯，擬着手編纂「上海工商名錄」一書，蒐羅務博，調查期確。迭承工商各業同業公會暨各業人士多方協助，或供給資料，或介紹調查。惟敝報編纂目的，旣爲便於工商界參玫，故調查紀錄，務求詳盡正確。用再公吿，請求本市各工廠工塲，公司行號（不論資本大小，營業廣狹，凡屬工商，均所歡迎。）惠賜正確調差資料資料內容，以下列各項爲主：　名稱，　地址，　電話電報信箱等，　創設年月，　組織（公司，合夥，獨資等），　營業種類，　重要職員姓名如董事長，董事，監察，經理，副理，廠長，主任等，店主，股東等項，務請詳細遂項見示直接函寄敝報「工商名錄資料部」，俾依照編入。就敝報立塲言，可達詳盡正確之目的，就工商業立塲言，不僅問接推廣營業，且可取得各界認識，無異義務廣告深信工商各業人士必能瞭解，樂於協助，編印在即，填寄從速。申報社謹啟</p>

<p>上海特別市　菜豆芽業同業公會，前有人冒名及對經當局査明已奉准部令，雜持原狀後，該會理事長陳夏霖，對於會務，竭力整飭，不遺餘力。近因市上菜蔬食物價格飛漲，一般平民，均以　菜佐餐爲主要食品，因　菜一物，不特可節省鹽　，且不論生熟可食，已成普遍化之民食，當此鮮白菜雪菜正在上市之際，一般會員同業，連日紛紛往該會要求配給　斤，蔣資應需，準備醃製，該會長據情後，卽經分呈財政部鹽務署，暨松江區鹽務管理局，准予登記，並配給用鹽，業奉當局核准，予以充分配給云。</p>
<p>滬市上週間金融工商市況</p>
<p>滬市金融與工商市況，上週間平稱趨低，　亦藉昻，仍無　常交易，銀根經巾儲與聯合準備　儘量辦理同業拆放原可趨鬆，但因秋節結賑期迫，頭寸仍感緊張。拆息掛牌始終爲二角三分，公債股票因時局關係略見高　，各種物品市價，因關係常局統制工作日形緊張，俱見下降，米糖計口配給公定市價，依然無變更，人心平定，蓋以配給形將普通實施之故，尤其當局另設之米糧統制委員會，積極籌備，今後米糧調節，既有負責人主持，則民食供給，可不致　乏云。</p>

<p>大眾生活</p>
<h3>機關職員的生活</h3>
<p>— 慕陶</p>
<p>我是公用事業機關專的一個職員，每月的薪金僅祇四百三十元，此外公司給我們各人一張額外配給的購米證（此證每月以戶口米之價格可買整米一斗三升五），而我家裏却共有四人，每月都賴這些錢過日子，我並沒有別的收入，因此每月就必須負上至少四百元的債務務！</p>
<p>這眞是不當家焉知柴米貴，眼看着二個小孩總是非常活潑地終日的嬉笑玩要，可是做丫爸的我，每晚這得爲次日的生活，苦思幾個鐘點，直到無力思想的時候，才昏然入睡。</p>
<p>這種夜夜九更天生活的苦磨，實在非身歷其境者無從能會，像我近兩年來的生活，做夢也想不着假日或暇時出去看一次電影來解悶，我從來也不曾用　菜來勸止孩兒的啼哭，我也從未想念到自己及家裏人衣服的破舊與不合時式，此外，要是病　降臨我家中人的任何一個，那就祗能聽天由命的忍受着熬下去。</p>
<p>常聽釗人家說解決生活最好的方法是「開源節流」，我現在的情形在支出方面，已是無可再節約了，那就　能在開源方面想辦法，所以我很想找一副業，希望藉此而多賺些錢，輔助家用，但是許多事我去試過，他們（執事者）早已備用妥了，那所謂招聘，報名，面試，等的事務，也不過是他們在股東會面前聊作數衍罷了，我也曾幾次在應試人中問聽到「供膳宿，我就可以不要薪水了」之類的乞求似的語言，這樣像我很需要着薪工的人自然是最易落選了，我的口才不流利，又少交際，　客的一行也就無從談起、身子又如此薄弱，去冬上江灣背米，雖然　了一些錢，返家後却倒在牀上好幾天，苦力的事，從此便不敢領敎，同時，我本身也委　太低能，又少　友幫助，要想有所高就，當然會比登天還難了。</p>
<p>這種情形，在我通　的朋友決不會相當，他們以爲一個機關職員的生活不怎樣舒適，至少也的過得去了，何至於終日　愁悶不堪，社會上的一般人士想　怕更不易　　了罷！</p>

<h3>阿圖島上山崎部隊　十八書夜英雄戰　毅勇精神雖敵人亦爲驚服</h3>
<p>阿圖島上山崎部隊的英勇就義，足以表示　軍的偉大精神。這樣驚天地泣鬼神的壯烈戰鬥，實使敵人美軍無上畏　，且使全世界人士五體投地佩服歌頌·部隊長山崎保代上校隨同兩千多名將士·一定是在北海的孤島上，心如鐵石，完全相信帝國的勝利前途，而從容犧牲的。記者願以拙笨的毛筆，述說一下山崎部隊十八晝夜的死門經過，警告後方人士。</p>
<p>一九四三年五月十二日，從上午兩點開始，敵方飛機濫施轟炸。自從去年六月八日，　軍佔領該島以來，企圖挽囘頽勢的美軍，依仗着飛機量上的優勢，會不分　夜轟炸該島。其熾烈程度，正如山崎部隊所稱的「羅斯福的定相信」一樣，但守備部隊毫不爲之所動。其問轟炸最激烈的，就是今年的五月十二日。這一天山崎部隊長馬上就料到，那是敵人登　的先兆。於是便卜命令</p>
<p>命令全體出動</p>
<p>「全體出動！」</p>
<p>在各處的高崗後·和在各處的深溝裏躱藏着準殺敵的士兵們，心原的野火開始熊熊燃燒了。期待已久的最後決鬥，終於降臨了。士兵們不期然而然地高喊出：「美軍，你們等着吧！」敵機的轟炸，與時俱增，愈演愈烈，此時亞留申島，在上午兩點。業已天充了。在雲霧中逐漸天明的阿圖島，由於敵機與時俱增的散佈强慕，而使人感覺到夜神又　降臨。稱而無數的敵機羣飛到我方陣地，撤下傳單來。那是不値一笑地動　投降。</p>
<p>「美兵發昏了麽？把那傳電帶囘華盛頓掃去吧！」</p>
<p>當天早農，在該島北部監視的兵，發見滿載美兵的船舶羣，在霧中向赫爾圖灣前進。山崎部隊長得到這個報告後，立即下令全體兵士，在該灣沿岸布陣。此時敵我的槍聲在相互交錯着，隆隆的砲擊，農撼著山谷，於是霧申　眠的阿圖島，一瞬問意成爲決戰的修羅塲。</p>
<p>十時三十分·仗　　勢的敵人又在該島南部麻　加集中著非常多的舟艇，　開始散閉隊形登陸，便和我們的隊伍展開了激烈殘酷的戰鬥。下午七時，在島北赫爾圖灣登陸的　軍，血該灣西岸推進，爽我們第一綫守備部隊在偉手可及的距離上發生了　戰。麻薩加方面的敵軍也是一樣，主要部隊第一次登陸後，馬上不斷增加着有力部對。</p>
<p>攻者逞强，但守者也不示弱。在美軍登陸的第一天（十二日）和第二天，皇軍的確發揮了精强無比的帝國軍人精神。尤其對於該島東部登陸的突軍所實行的殲滅戰，更加如此。是在下午，我們第一綫守備隊發見了在霧中　動的敵軍，向薩拉諾灣沿岸衝來。膽小的敵兵，尙未發見我們的時候，早已浪費着子彈射過來。我軍則屏息以待。須臾問，敵卞船擊一隻一隻地靠到了岸上，即行　備登陸。而我們毫不　鬆者個良好機會，就一致向敵開火。遭受意外　　的敵方兵士，在舟艇上，　水裏，砂灘上，全都臥倒了。美兵的悲叫和槍聲，以及舟艇被炸裂的反響……簡直成爲鬼哭狼號的地獄。殘存的美兵·以舟艇爲盾牌·而問我們挺進。</p>
<p>「　鋒！」</p>
<p>隊長喊了這一聲，便首先拔刀　入敵陣。於是殺聲便充滿了沙灘。</p>
<p>被狂妄的戰必勝攻必取得號角所鼓舞起來的美國兵士，不遠千里而來，看到日本這種「肉蛋戰」，便左衝右突，企圖逃走。我們不放　的迫擊格闊，以及血肉橫飛的白刃戰，致使敵人東倒四伏，叫苦連天。○小時後，在這塊砂灘上，就完全看不見敵方一兵一卒了。</p>
<p>十三日，忘掉了昨天慘敗的美軍，又企圖在　拉諾灣登陸。這一天，胸有成竹的皇軍也冒着砲火，在水邊上擊退了敵人。此後，一直到山崎部隊全軍就義後，敵軍　是不敢在蘭拉諾灣再來嘗試登陸。</p>
<p>正面夜襲戰鬥</p>
<p>山崎部隊長在這種危急形勢下，死守着陣地，希望在夜深時候，殘滅敵人，奇襲成功。亞留申島的夜，是很晚方來的、且是短促的。就想利用這樣一種暗夜來打擊敵人，日落後，我軍首先向　　加正面的敵人開始猛烈的攻擊。帝國軍人的傳統夜襲戰。也就在這個北海的孤島上·淋漓　致的果敢發揮了，在我軍的高喊殺聲　，肉搏刺月下，敵人的隊伍紊亂了。敵兵逃　迫擊　抱頭則痛　。經過　樣的　襲戰，敵人後退了一千公尺至兩千公尺。</p>
<p>天亮丁的十三號，比昨天，　少微稀薄些，在地上可以看三四百公尺　·由於昨天東部海岸兩度擊退敵　登陸·南部海岸一度　　　　滅三個中　敵兵，而北部及西部海岸與敵軍對峙中，所以我軍將士精神煥發，有氣冲斗牛之勞。</p>
<p>敵人從十三號的一早，密寗地再向我們射擊，子彈如雨點般地降落者。砲彈激記飛砂走石，因而山谷在剎那問完全改變。我軍常常乘機出奇劇勝，曾與敵人以極大損失。南部海岸上敵方攻擊特別激烈，我軍訓決定先與以嚴重打擊，因而得保全原在陣地·正午，敵軍由北部和南部兩　岸在軍　上，一致開始砲轟，南部海岸的砲火最爲激烈，直向我軍陣地麻　卡爾山頂猛　。敵人兵員比我方多一倍，射出的子彈比我方多十倍·且從海上有艦砲轟擊，我卞則無，更有空中的轟炸·我方則缺如。我方這一天處在這樣的射擊與轟炸下·仍然保守着自己的陣地·且寸土不　，該島北部赫爾　灣高地附近　敵方攻擊非常熾烈·我軍雖有相當損失，但並未退後一步。在南部海岸佔　着高　的我軍，與盤　於麻　加灣西北高地的敵軍相對着　　，結果被我方轟毀兩條中隊。</p>
<p>十三號天暗了·北部海岸的敵人又增强了很多兵力·且　於爬山似乎都是訓練有素·同時更憑着量的優勢，有前進着。在赫爾團灣組麻產加灣，以戰鬥艦爲旗幟的敵方艦隊，來囘流動着威嚇我軍，在烟霧消　的地方可以在到這種現象。</p>
<p>敵艦抱頭鼠竄</p>
<p>當時發生了一件奇　現象·在南方海岸麻　　灣正而高地監視中的我方守　部隊·從這一天的卑　就看見了敵方　逐艦在麻　加　上。敵艦在椗泊着，不斷向我方陣地轟擊，正午時，椗泊中的一艘　逐艦，突然開始移動·迅速向問航駛。我們部隊以爲敵艦向他方面移動，但敵艦卻是迅速向陸地來了。</p>
<p>「怎樣一囘事？」</p>
<p>我們守備隊員全都不明白共奧妙。在這個時候，敵艦左舷突然湧起來了一個高而壯的水柱。</p>
<p>「潛水艇！」</p>
<p>「我們的潛水艇！」</p>
<p>從海上來援軍了。我們潛水艇從海裏發射魚需。敵艦在靠陸　的海灘上擱淺了。</p>
<p>在這同一個時候，在北部海岸赫爾　灣上也出現了這種軍艦　淺的現象。這是敵艦隊正對着我方陣地實行猛烈砲轟的辰光，突然在敵艦傍面，衝起來一個頂天的水柱，緊接着又是一個。這個龐然大物，如一個海島般的敵艦，竟開始傾斜，向海洋上遁逃，刹那間，即消逝於　霧裏。剩餘的其他敵艦羣·隊形馬上紊亂·而開始紛亂的四散。自以爲得勢的敵艦羣·揚威耀武地划來駛去，向我方任意砲轟，而竟在我方無敵潛水艇的　　下抱頭鼠竄。我們潛水艇勇敢地克服了最困難的自然條件，竟自破萬里浪，而前來阿團島與敵作戰。直到五月二十四日，擊傷戰鬭艦一戰，巡準艦一艘。</p>
<p>全體束袖衝鋒</p>
<p>一　到十五號，雖然每天　有激戰，但我軍保　著原有　地不動，　　雖然十倍於我，但我方在四天內，僅有數十名的　失。敵人不斷地增張兵力，在南部海岸，兵員在不斷登陸中，敵方兵了逐漸增到多過我方數十倍，又加上用○門大砲向我們壓迫。在該地的守備部隊，都抱着戰至最後一滴血，必須阻擋住敵軍的前進。道一天·敵軍第一綫部隊衝過來同我們肉搏。○隊長也以爲常此以往的　峙下去，只是坐以待斃的自殺行爲，所以準備命令全體隊員作總衝鋒戰·大家都用白帶經緊袖口，用白布通在頭蓋上，掛下刺刀，準備着衝鋒的機會到來。全體衝鋒開始了。殺聲響徹了山谷。刺刀戮斷了，就捉住敵兵用牙咬喉嚨。雖然敵人受到我們的打擊很厲害，但因衆寡懸　，終於我們的北部高地守備隊全體英勇就義了。</p>
<p>十六號，敵人仍然不斷的在南部海岸繼續登　，在麻　卡爾山頂上，會有敵方坦克軍出現。在赫爾圖灣東部的我方部隊又曾實行夜　，使敵方陣營陷於混亂。</p>
<p>十七號，早晨五時敵方飛機來轟炸，北美B二十五型飛機對著他們自己的陣地濫投炸彈。這一次誤炸，竟使敵人遭受很大損失。</p>
<p>十八號，陸地戰仍然非常激烈，敵方空軍和海軍也仍然不斷地實行恫嚇攻擊·在麻蘭加敵兵不斷登陸。在北都海岸上曾展開敵我的混戰。</p>
<p>十九號，從早晨　敵機飛來轟炸，且用飛機不斷投下糧餉及彈藥。這是美國登陸自來第一次，這量證明我方潛水艇的活動奏效·致使敵方的海上給養補充困難了。</p>
<p>二十號，我軍乘敵人在島內推進的時候，便實行　　反攻。於是雙方混亂到一處，演出最慘烈的肉　戰及格鬥戰。</p>
<p>援軍海鷹飛來</p>
<p>二十號以後，敵軍兵力補充告一段落·二十一號和二十二號，我軍曾向麻　加灣果敢出華，敵人雖受很大損失，但我軍的損失也擴大起來。</p>
<p>二十三號·當我們聽到飛機聲音，以爲是敵　又來轟炸，但飛　飛近時仔細一看，原來是日本飛機，我方海鷹在天空中翻翔着，山崎部隊的將士們手揮着　　，流着熱淚，高呼「萬歲！」轉瞬間，我方海鷹　就飛向　洽克天灣的敵方軍艦去投彈。空中魚雷投下，一艘敵艦應聲起火，眨眼間，即沉入海底。</p>
<p>在陸地上觀望着的我方將士，突然發出　萬歲！萬歲！」的歡呼聲·這一天我方海鷹的戰果就是巡洋艦一艘擊沉，驅逐艦一艘擊沉，其他一艘起火</p>
<p>此次我方海鷹來擊，對於美國人簡直是一個謎，不知是從何處飛來的。而對我們山崎部　歡呼之爲「百萬援軍」。</p>
<p>山崎部隊長時時在準備着反攻，而死守着自己一方面的陣地，守砲的兵，以及工兵都扛起槍來進行攻擊。</p>
<p>二十四號和二十五號、敵機並沒有來，只是少數軍艦向我方砲轟着。這是由於我方潛水艇及航空部隊的活　結果。山崎部隊長就乘這憫機會·實行改編和强化軍隊”我方海　飛來·投下許多糧　及彈藥。</p>
<p>二十六號，敵人的攻　非常激烈，山崎部隊長早已知道這是最後的戰鬥。在這個時俟·山崎部隊長　通信斷絕了、　以就在槍林彈雨中·把這一天敵人的兵力，戰法，裝備等記述卞來，轉告給上司。</p>
<p>自從二十五號以來，由於敵人的猛攻，我方部隊的兵員、只剩一百數十人了。在這個時候，只有用全力給敵人以致命打擊，　無他策。如在陣地裏保持着自己的兵力，和敵軍長期對峙，這並不是一個辦法。那樣　　就會斷絕的，也就會失掉打緊敵人的好機會。與共在這個這地孤島上苟延殘喘地活着，莫如　烈就義。於是把這個決心報告上司毀掉重要文仲。</p>
<p>「今夜定行最後的夜　、關於今夜的襲擊成果，請在空中偵察」。這是山崎部隊的最後悲壯的報告。自此以後，無論怎樣叫阿圖島的電台，都沒有囘響。這是因電台消毀了的原故。傷病兵士在微笑裏，破腹自殺了。山崎部隊長召集殘餘兵士，作了一個最後的告別辭。</p>
<p>「加彈盡，則用刺刀，如刺刀斷，則用手，如手傷，則用牙，總之，要　量多殺一個敵人。從　心　的跳動已經停止。並魂魄也要衝入敵陣」。</p>
<p>說完後，就領導着全　將士向　宮遙拜天皇。對於非戰鬥員的軍屬，也分發給槍械。被烟火營　的面孔上都　着笑容，於一九四三年五月二十九日的夜　、　拼命地衝向麻薩卡爾山項上的美軍陣地。皇軍這種超人力，超　神力，把美國的兵士鎭　了。按敵方的情報，一直到六月二日，激戰仍然在進行着。一九四三年六月二日，山崎部隊雖然與世永別了，但其精神將永乘不朽。（北方○○基地　特派員發）（漢節擇自八月二十九日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>焚書</h3>
<p>— 夜人</p>
<p>二年前，叔父把我驚到一月營式行　　當學徒，我什麽都不知道，　起事來　要受到同事們的微笑；這　還好·我最覺痛苦的是—行中禁止我看警！</p>
<p>起初我不如道行中的規矩，把自己心愛的警帶到行中來，但不敢當着許多人前面看，我只偷倫的背着人家　　綫房後面的一間小房中看。一天一個和我最知己的同事，對我說：</p>
<p>「鮮，當心被人家去告訴經理先生，那是小好玩的，非吃一次「排頭」不可。從前有個同事和你一般的歡喜　　，後來被經理罵了一頓，在當天晚上就走了！」但我說：</p>
<p>「多　你的忠告，看當無論如何總比跑跳舞塲、開棧房好得多了，…」</p>
<p>有一天下午，我又在棧房後面的一間小房中看書。正看得非常高興的時　，忽然晴天　　般的見經理站在我的背後·高聲地說。</p>
<p>「喊你半天，原來在這裏看書、倒也快活！」接着把我手上拿的書奪去撕碎了，我是多麼痛心呵！好像失了一件寶貝似的。但罵聲又無情的響個不停。</p>
<p>「這裏給你學生意來，還是　　來呢？如果　生意來的，應該將本書拋掉·一心學生意；如果來說書的，還是仍舊囘到家裏去這個痛快，這裏是不一要你這般人的！」</p>
<p>我想起了出門時母親對我說的話：一阿祥！要乖乖的跟別人上進，聽先生的話，千萬不要太驕，太驕要吃　的……」不覺吸淚奪　而出，從此後就不敢在白天裏看書了。</p>
<p>足足有二三星期沒有看　，覺得非常無聊，比沒飯吃還難過。一天晚上‘同事們都睡了，我輕輕的扭充了一盞五支光的雷　，翻開了一本多天不看的書、在微弱的燈光下閱　，心裏不覺忐忑的跳個不停。這樣地過了半年，一天晚上·我也同樣的然到同事都睡去，扭充了雷燈，在燈光下看書·眼睛不覺矇　起來，漸漸地　去了。第二天早晨方才　覺電燈還開着，幾個同事已經醒來了，正在　着我</p>
<p>「伯伯那樣的罵他·這小赤偌還是不怕，半夜裏電燈開得盛亮的，害我昨晚睡不着，今天一定告訴伯伯，給他一點顏色看……」經理的侄子阿芳說</p>
<p>果然，這天早上，經理先生一出來‘就呌我進賬房間，問我是否每天晚上看書的，我只呆呆的望看他不響，於是他光火了一大聲地說：</p>
<p>「問你爲什麼不響？　木頭—　芳把祥牀上藏的書都去拿來。」</p>
<p>當阿芳捧着一堆書走進願房間，向我冷笑時，我眞恨不得跑去咬他幾口</p>
<p>「現在怎麼樣？將書燒了吧！」他冷冷地問我，我沒有囘答。「都燒了它！」經理說。</p>
<p>阿芳到了一根火柴書燒起來了，眼看著半年來積　買來的書一本一本地被火吞去，化成灰燼，心中有無限憤怒與悲痛一忽然經理冷笑起來，用手　着嘴上的老　　　對我說：</p>
<p>「哈哈·肉痛嗎？現在可沒有書看了、哦、哈哈……」</p>
<p>最後的一　話說非常　。</p>
<p>但第二天叔父却叫我去，敎訓了一頓。</p>
<p>「從此不準再在行中看書……聽見沒有？</p>
<p>從叔父處囘來，心裏還是不明白：看書到底有什麽害處呢？</p>
<p>這樣，我失去了一件精神上的寶貝，變成了一備靈魂的　　者！不知何時，才能再享受到看書的茲味　！</p>
<h3>寄林</h3>
<p>— 頌藍</p>
<p>我明天要邀醫院了，夜裏便得動手術，我心裏寂寞得緊，我很難受。</p>
<p>昨夜，父親來過·板起面孔與我談話：「第一，後天你　院，只能住三等房問，錢不能多用，我簽下了字，以後沒有空來看你。第二二，家裏你不能　，在外面　你住在什麽地方。第三，今年你得結婚，不然，以後我沒錢嫁你，我可管不了，你不能說我不公平。」</p>
<p>父親走後，我克制不了自己的感情，我掩面痛哭起來，　　淚流　了，我只有飮泣，我睜大了淚光瑩瑩的眼睛問人家：「剛才來的是不是我父親？」人家說我傻，我却想：我是不是父親養的呢？在二十二歲靑年時代就亡故的母親，三年婚後生活是怎樣同父親過的？這些都是　！</p>
<p>夜裏，我贏弱地站在陽台上，議初秋的晚風用柔軟的舌頭舐看我的短髮，　下弦月潔白的米　吻着我的面頰，讓星星閃着悄然的眼睛微笑，讓美麗而深沉的夜神秘地嘆息，我撫摩着心底傷痕，翻開生命的歷史……</p>
<p>林：你現在何處？我們分　半年多了，你天南地北，到處流浪；我漂泊異鄕，淪落天涯。如今，病帶給我苦痛，帶給我寂莫。父親冷談我，別人不管我，沒有人開切我，東　有人　愛我，我用眼淚想着你，你卻多時沒有音訊，你怎樣了呢？你沒有看見第天又去了，秋天已來？杜鵑花的血淚，遙　　　的長嘶，帶給我多少悲哀！</p>
<p>呀！你告訴我，我們幾時再見？親愛的！</p>
<p>記得初春裏，我病着，你離開了我·我們硬生生地分別了，沒有一句話，不說一聲冉會。更沒有　一下手。默默地我們在無邊夜色裏分開了，我彷彿看見你品瑩的眼淚，但是我痛　眼　一片置，再睜開眼睛，已經沒有了你</p>
<p>我幾時囘到你身邊來呢？我們從來沒有躺在一起過，你有神聖的事業，我有煩重的職務，我仍被　在兩個世界裏。我要　，媽媽死了：我要父親，父親不當我女兄；　要你，可是你在那裏？……</p>

<h3>面孔</h3>
<p>— 鄭悶</p>
<p>我們假如從生到死的一段路程巾，不到社會上去做事，一直在家庭重過活的話，那你每日所看見的只不過幾隻你所熟悉的面孔，父母的臉，終是慈祥的，見女的臉終是天眞的，可愛的，依靠著擬的人的臉，終是一副服從獻媚的氣色。假如我們在商店中做職員，那就不得了，每日你就可以看見許許多多的不同的面孔，那就怪難受了，第一只看見而使你感覺到異樣的面孔是老闆娘的一副尊容·店員在接生意時。有在旁邊的老板娘監督，她的尊容是變化無常的，店員假如不能把那　簡買做成時，老板娘的臉是會雜成鐵靑的</p>
<p>次是要看到許多頗客的各種不同的面孔了，有的因爲是非常的和氣或可愛，可是有的是一臉橫肉，兩眼圓睜，　面孔看去都是尋事的氣色。</p>
<p>面孔！面孔！何以變化無窮呢？</p>
<h3>程先生的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>星期日的下午，火　　張着，程先生枯坐在亭子問裏，想呀想的……前樓正是孩子們的世界，　得不亦樂乎，亭子間雖是又悶又熱，但比較還淸靜。因此被視爲洞天福地，程光生唯一的自由天地了。</p>
<p>半年之前，程先生想到了由於大人物的介紹，脫離了那個餓不死吃不飽的職業，踏進了令人羡慕的地產公司，把心上的一塊重石抛得遠遠地……滿心想可以巴巴結結把生活安定了。但是現在·非但計劃好預備絡續添製的新衣宣有上身·連固有的舊衣沒有些汲汲　危，難以保留了。眼前就有一件雖事不能解決。</p>
<p>「明天山荊生日……請…大駕光臨…哈…請早些來…十六　助助興…」昨天那位皮笑肉不笑的經理先生，打起了哈哈，滿臉堆笑的話·又在腦海　響起了。不用說，一份　　是不能免的了，而且，那些同事……</p>
<p>「喂」！那位經理的　親劉先生，已在打奉承巴結的主意了。「我們大家來送壽桃　糕好嗎？」</p>
<p>「　！請我來算……大約每人公攤二百元……不貴不貴：另外再各送一份禮好了……哈！」僅事　的姪兒王先生附和着、而且更　本加厲地。</p>
<p>「天呀！」程先生心專打算着，「眼看這個月的薪水　又得扣去四成了，家裏妻子兒女邢等着吃飯……」</p>
<p>「老王，明天打牌預備多少：哈…三千？不夠吧！哈·」不知誰又在　備明天的助與（？）了，更深深地刺痛了程先生的心，在朦朦的眼光裏，依稀看見王先生的手指由三而四而五……不知不覺，程先生滴下了一棵實貴的眼淚</p>
<p>×　×　×</p>
<p>本來，像今天這樣好的天氣是很難得的，往常，他總是愉快地帶領了孩子們上公園去。可是今天情形不同，他眞再也提不起興　來了。</p>
<p>想着自己的靜坐在汗氣　漫的亭子問裏，完全是爲了躱避那些應酬，拜這是不能不去的，可是那些助興，他想不參加了，也許找　了他一家，也不能凑滿上千的數字，於是，　難似地想在家　挨　宴席開始的時候。</p>
<p>打算今天赴宴去穿的那件唯一的長衫，正在前樓太太的手裏縫補着，　子…祗有一項下雨天用的·光著腦袋吧！鞋子，想現鞋子·跟著想起那天鞋箱舖子裏的事，他好像　見：</p>
<p>「走！出去！買不起鞋子問啥價鈿……開　發了財來買好勒！……哈…：」</p>
<p>一陣獲刺的冷　　　在他的腦際，心頭·又好似一技技冷箭深深地射在毫無抵抗的　弱得心上、</p>
<h3>斷思零感</h3>
<p>— 徐輝光</p>
<p>生命的浪費</p>
<p>關於生命的浪費，我久有此想，記得不久以前也曾和同學議及，我說：「人生如朝露·能享長壽的業僅有八九十年的　　，而其中三分之一的生命及不幸患病　費的時間耗在牀上·三分之一的生命　掉在休息、飲食等事上、還有不少的時間　　在　愁　　　等的事情上。眞正用在服務社會·　　　的工作上的·僅佔個人生命上很少的一部份時間。至於那些洋公子小姐游手好閒之徒，終日　遊戲　·簡直將　各生命付之浪！—所以我有時覺得人生本　浪　的！一黨時雖言之尚能成　、現在總之　究竟生殖　激、是的、個人服務社會、　一此有得於人羣的工作僅僅佔生命上的　少部份，唯其如此，這一小部份的生命更值得我們的寶貴！唯有平凡始能表顯偉大、唯大難份生命的浪費、一小部份用之於服務社會人羣的生命、值得我們如何　的善用珍重！</p>
<p>自省</p>
<p>「一失不耕，或有受之飢；一婦不撤、或有受之　。」這二句話，正表示個人的力量雖微，而構成社會國家之原子　爲個人、所以不論是牛　，是織女。他們雖然　　平凡的工作、而　獻於社會的、實亦不下於偉人們所幹的事情，而於此更可見切切　實的工作、實勝過堂堂皇皇的高</p>
<p>空言，無補實際，這正是　人的大弱　。</p>
<p>「坐面言，不如起而行！」我欲　言。</p>

<h3>上海靑年會　提倡體育之努力　以體育運動代不正當娛樂</h3>
<p>上海中華基督敎靑年會、推動體育事業，已有三四十年歷史。上海之有　類運動，可以說是由該會創始的。該會體育事工目標，以着重適應時代需要，提倡身體精神心理健康運動，糾正目前體育界畸形發展，提高運動道德，廣泛介紹各種運動，並翼以體育式娛樂，代替目前社會中一切不正常娛樂。舉辦各種體操班，籃排球及游泳等班；人量訓練初級運動技術人才，以謀體育之普河化。並爲提高大衆興趣與普及認識起見，集中優秀運動員，作有組織的球類比賽及體育表演。幾十年來，上海的運動中。或爲該會訓練所成，或爲該會各種運動隊隊友，散佈各處比比皆是。茲將該會體育事業近况，作一簡單介紹如下：</p>
<p>體育設備講到設備方面，該會四川路分會，有健身房一座，內可作谷種體　籃　　比賽用，有手球　兩個，昔日名將朱寬等，常在那裏練習或比賽。有游泳池一座·池雖小而具有悠久歷史，在這裏學會游泳的，不知凡幾。此外還有成人少年女子沐浴至及更衣室各一，乒乓游戲室一彈子房一。在八仙橋幾會方面，有較大健身房一座，建築雖近簡陋，但目前上海戶內運動室，尙以此室面積此較大而合標準　所以滬上各種籃排球比賽，多假此室舉行。有運動一座，專爲各種舉重器械及個人運動而設。有國術廳一座、位於該會十　樓頂，內建築與設備甚佳。此外有健康理療室一間，沐浴三問，均係完　設備。</p>
<p>組織機構該會體育事業工作人員組織，以體育委員會為量高組織，委員會主席由該會董事沈　良君擔任。委員為周家其　　　康，余郇子，王守方　道　　位，干事部有梁兆安君，負一切體育部責任，兼教導器械操與游泳等，　荷生君擔任會友體育及辦理各種球類比賽工作，陳富章君擔任該會中學校體育工作，尙有各班教練及指導多人，未及一一介紹。</p>
<p>體育趨向該會體育事業最近趨向，亦有足以告老，即該會體育包括在下列三種教育工作；　體育教育，　健康敎育，　娛樂敎育。屬於體育教育方面有各種體操球類中練，球類比賽，國術，拳擊，摔角，游泳等，純以訓練體格及技能為目標。屬於建康敎育方面，有衛生運動，　養展覽，種牛痘，打防疫針，舉行健康比賽，檢騐體格，體能測騐，健康理療，沐浴等，均就此節圍進行。至於娛樂教育方面如遠足旅行，脚踏車旅行，檯球。乒乓球，團體舞蹈等，都是帶有娛樂性的體育。</p>
<p>各種班團基於上三項原則，該會現有極多班團隊小組織，將參加者按程度分配，共受初級或普通訓　者入「班」，如器械母，公餘班，　衛班，摔角班，建自班，拳擊班，初　游泳班等，均受短期訓練，敎以各種基本技能。待學成後，如欲受長期訓練及更高深技能者，可參加各種「團」如晨　團，建身團，游泳團，拳擊社選手性質，代表該會參加各種比賽如中靑籃球隊中靑游泳隊，拳擊隊等。其餘特別組織中有裁判　練班，邀　　類比賽，拳擊比賽，戶內運動，體育　座，健康比賽等，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>球類運動　　球　運動，前面已提及上海方面當推該會爲　矢，所以該會總會健身房中，以參加球類運動者爲最多，尤以藍球最受大衆歡迎。除一般普通會友常在練習外，幾乎所有本埤各著名球隊球員，如余郇子孔廣益　　　卓國榮陳學　馬燦希與及仁餘華聯　隊晨友等隊球員，無不常奔馳該健身房中。每屆秋末，該分舉行　友杯　球比賽，隨僅農該會會友可參加　但上海名球員，多屬該會會友，故皆盛　一時。</p>
<p>水上運動該會對於水上運動　提倡不遺餘力，每屆夏季，即將游泳池開　，並收以極低補貼費，俾大衆能參加該游泳池採取團體游泳方法，故能對參加者作技術上之訓練。査去歲與今年兩季中，參加老約三千五百人，其中初學成者有一千五百人，滬上水上名將如溫敬令許守強陸惠傑陳效忠王中成等，皆中靑游泳隊隊員，兼任指導，故學習者極爲興奮。　組織與訓練、　，計分四種班團：　初　游泳班，凡不　游泳者，六次敎成之。　中　游，冰班，授以各種泳式游　及跳水。　中　游泳團訓練各種高深游泳技術。　自習游泳班，不限程度，自由練習。其餘分期舉辦者，有游泳表演，游泳測騐，游泳比賽，今年　　華人公開游泳比賽，更　空前之　舉也。</p>
<p>上海靑年會乃一基督教團體·　體育工作，乃該會德智體羣四育之一，故其提倡體育，亦基於該會服務社會培植人才之旨，會有基督之精神，其所以與其他團體不同者，亦卽此一點耳·（韋納斯）</p>
<h3>上海體育界大事　西人足球會結束　中西足球賽由市體育會接辦</h3>
<p>上海足球會（　稱上海西人足球聯合會）於九月卞日宣告結束。從此中西足球比賽，由上海市體育會接辦。的確是上星期內上海體育界之大事，也是四十餘年來上海足球界之大變遷。發起組織，在倫敦註册，發起的時候達在一九〇二年。當時開始舉行史高托杯賽，第一屆錦標爲陶克工程會獲得；臘克斯，西商，商團甲等隊均爲參加比賽之巨頭</p>
<p>迨至一九〇七年，開始甲組聯賽，次年又舉行　際杯。其後次　舉行字林杯，高　杯，初級杯，預備杯，甲組乙組丙組了組聯賽，總之在二十年前，上海的足球界，爲蘇格蘭，英格蘭、愛爾闌，四商，臘克斯聖芳濟等隊之天下。</p>
<p>中國球隊參加上海足球會始於一九二六年，沈嗣良等入會任職員。一九二七年，樂華榮獲高級盃及甲組雙料錦標。一九三三年　優游獲初級杯，次年東華奪得史高托杯及初級杯。中華隊參加國際杯後，一九二八年興九二九年連獲兩年冠軍。</p>
<p>去年迄今，上海足球會由康泊遜任會長，仍舉行史高托杯，字林杯，初級杯、甲乙丙三組聯賽，但範團較小，生氣大减。上屋期五（九月十日）下午五時該會假匯中飯店舉行年會。出席者計會長康泊遜，　副會長及執行，上訴各委員，以及各球隊代表三十餘人。主席康泊遜報告上屆各杯賽經過華，繼續作賬目收支報告，計收入三十四萬餘元，除付書記雷顏士年俸一萬元，及電話雜費九千元外，結存現金僅一百十八元零。旋由會長康泊遜提議，執委德羅舉附義，爲適應環境起見，上海足球會應宣告結束，所有會務及一切進行事宜，以及資產職權等項，　移交上海體育會接收、繼續辦理，經出席委員一致通過，從此西人足球會名詞　已成歷史上陳蹟。聞市體育會業已準備繼續辦理上海足球比賽事宜云。</p>
<h3>三省女排球隊　初戰即獲勝利　以二對一克華嚴</h3>
<p>三省女子排球隊，成軍未久，昨日（十一日）初度露面，約戰華嚴隊交鋒，於巨發來斯路三省體育會運動塲。三省先聲　人，以二十二比二十取得首局。華嚴不甘雌伏，復以二十比十八收復失地，在最後決賽中，三省發奮圖強。拚命進攻以二十一對十七·獲得最後勝利。　役論功行賞·三省陳梅貞應居功第一·攻球阻截，制敵死命。李波王福芝史瑞娟均屬不弱。華嚴失文佩　糾糾有丈夫　概。劈殺利害、功不可沒。視敬亦有良好表演。裁判乃棄球從商之陸翔千君。</p>

<h3>健身訓練簡易法（二）</h3>
<p>— 著　一德譯</p>
<p>七·自動的胸部</p>
<p>自動的胸部，爲正　之呼吸，與完美之　康所必需。所謂自勸的　部者，共上部高起，固定不動，不因呼吸而升降；在不隨意呼吸時，既堅固如　，即在隨意呼吸時，亦固定如故，，至在據烈運動，或大聲呼叫時亦然。</p>
<p>將雙手放放胸上，使胸部成爲被動。胸腔下隊，一若胸中已無一物。然後藉肌肉之動作，使其升高，而不　吸氣之力。</p>
<p>依此練習，不久當知需用多小肌肉運動，與多少注意，可使胸腔成爲白動，而不必常需特別之　力，與特別之注意。</p>
<p>此事亦當令其成爲第二天性。但不可過度，以致胸部強　。而失其平衡，殊不牙觀。</p>
<p>八·呼吸</p>
<p>不可自口呼吸。犬類之用口呼吸，係出天性，非人類所宜效犬也。</p>
<p>正確之呼吸，須有正　之姿勢。直立，身體　向前傾，勿向後仰。不可令身體彎曲，但由踝關節向前傾斜，切勿强直。維持胸部之自動（高起不動），膝，髖，與腹向後：使身體之重心向前，機全在趾根上面，故足跟雖仍着地，而所受之分量極輕</p>
<p>即以手指置於跟下，亦不致受傷。</p>
<p>九·膈呼吸</p>
<p>此係包括腹，肋，與費呼吸在內，即前，後，側，三面。每種須分別論之。</p>
<p>在以下之呼吸運勸中，身體除　與腰之動作外，不可有其他動作。胸之上部高起，固定不動。藉肌肉動作之力，而勿　吸氣之力；維持此位置，若預備受人拳　者胸部之姿勢，最爲緊要，故宜時常注意，以期謹農於心，而不可忘却。</p>
<p>十·腹呼吸</p>
<p>腹呼吸之名詞，甚易使人誤解，故不能不一言說明之。練習腹呼吸，常致發生重大影響。此爲衆所知者。實則腹部並不呼吸，胸部亦不呼吸，但常有腹呼吸與胸呼吸之名。</p>
<p>正確之腹呼吸，爲一强壯有益之運動。當膈收縮時，壓迫其下面之胃與肝，此動作可以促進胃之消化。腹呼吸一名詞，乃由吸氣時腹部向前之動作而來。</p>
<p>依正確之姿勢直立。（練習腹呼吸時，正確之　勢，常已成為第二天性。）</p>
<p>指尖放在腰綫之中央。由鼻孔緩緩吸入一深長之氣。使胸部抬高。固定不動。在手指安放處以下，幾無動作。腹壁之下部，亦不需有何動作。當開始吸氣之時，須覺腹部有一種抵抗手指之向前運動。緩緩吸氣，俟肺部充滿之時，使隔勿動，略停片時，然後緩緩呼氣。</p>
<p>腹呼吸　置手腹上；吸氣，阻膈運動，緩緩呼氣。</p>
<p>注意　分班班習，呼吸三次已足；個人練習，可各依自己之判斷。</p>
<p>十一·肋呼吸</p>
<p>依正確之姿勢直立。將手指之背面放在下肋部。由鼻孔緩　吸入一深長之氣。胸之上部高起固定不動。當吸氣之初，將　察一種抵抗手指之側面述動。</p>
<p>肋呼吸　置手於下肋部；吸氣；阻隔運動；緩緩呼氣。</p>
<p>注意　分班練習，呼吸三次憶足；個人練習，可各依自己之判斷。（未完）</p>
<p>肋部呼吸　腹部呼吸</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on Jiangsu Provincial Politics</h3>
<p>Since the Nationalist Government's return to the capital, public attention has been focused on the political measures of the central government, while neglecting those of local governments. In our observation, this perception stems partly from a subjective illusion that the central government is primary and the local government is secondary, believing that if the central government manages politics well, the local government will also do so. It is also partly due to an objective illusion that the world situation is constantly evolving in tension, and dealing with this tension is the responsibility of the central government, so everyone only pays attention to the central government's movements. However, in reality, the central and local governments have a relationship like that of lips and teeth, an inseparable whole. Therefore, local governments must earnestly cooperate in implementing the central government's policies in order to achieve their effectiveness. If local governments fail to cooperate in implementing central government policies, or even act independently in the opposite direction, the result will be a disruption of the system and the policies will not be implemented. Therefore, we should give local governments' political measures the same attention as the central government's.</p>
<p>We recently discussed the future of Jiangsu provincial politics, sincerely pointing out the various weaknesses of the past, hoping to correct them in the future. While the government should be held responsible for the existence of these weaknesses, it is also our inescapable shortcoming that our people's attention was focused on the central government while neglecting the local government, thus failing to urge for improvements at all times and in all places.</p>
<p>Now, Chen Qun has been specially appointed by the National Government to succeed as the Governor of Jiangsu Province. We firmly believe that he will bring about a new look and facilities to meet the expectations of the public. We hope that the central and local governments' policies will be unified and not disjointed. At the same time, we remind everyone to attach equal importance to local politics. Chen Qun has served as an official for a long time and has rich political experience. Now, having been transferred from the Minister of Interior to a local official, he will be able to handle the role with ease in theory. He naturally has a clear understanding of the advantages and disadvantages and the key points of the promotion of central and local politics, and has a clear plan in mind. However, driven by the desire to improve Jiangsu's politics in the future, we reiterate the few points we raised a few days ago as follows:</p>
<p>First, we emphasize the importance of the issue of personnel. Because currently, Chinese politics, undeniably, has not yet established a solid foundation of the rule of law. The talent and integrity of civil servants remain the biggest factors for good politics. Therefore, the future personnel matters of the provincial government should take "talent-only" as the standard for selection and evaluation. Existing personnel should be screened and retained or eliminated according to standards. For new entrants, there should be no regional bias, eliminate bureaucratic habits, and emphasize vigor and spirit.</p>
<p>Second, governing does not lie in empty words. Local politics should focus on promoting central government policies and be pragmatic. What people need most are practical benefits and virtuous governance, not high-sounding political programs or grand visions. We hope that those in power can grasp this public sentiment and work earnestly.</p>
<p>Third, although Jiangnan is a rice-producing area, the people of Jiangsu Province are still most distressed by the shortage of food. How to achieve the goal of increasing food production and reducing the suffering of the people of Jiangsu should be the first priority of virtuous governance in the future. We hope this will be seriously planned.</p>
<p>Jiangsu is where the national capital is located, where the famous commercial port of the East is located, the center of the country's economy and culture, playing a model role in national politics, and the most important province in the peaceful area. At the time of the reorganization of the provincial government, take this opportunity to thoroughly refresh politics and assume the important mission!</p>
<h3>Review of the Internal and External Situations of Various Countries in the Fifth Year of the European War (II)</h3>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>When the European War broke out, the Soviet Union joined hands with Germany, not participating in any of the belligerent countries, maintaining neutrality, and standing outside the whirlpool of war.</p>
<p>Post-War Issues - The Soviet Union Has a Part</p>
<p>After the start of the European War, Germany occupied the eastern half of Poland, Karelia, the three Baltic coastal countries, Serbia, and Pskov. Twenty-six months ago, the German-Soviet war broke out. On a three-thousand-kilometer-long front, an unprecedented continental offensive and defensive war in history unfolded. The Soviet Union alone bore the brunt of the German army's attack, becoming a major player in the European War, while Britain took this opportunity to gain a chance to breathe and recover. And indirectly helped the United States to have a European operation, that is, the Soviet Union's war power. From this point of view, the current Soviet Union is launching offensives on all fronts, and in order to facilitate wartime operations, it is not unreasonable to demand the immediate opening of a second front. However, in the public announcements of the Soviet-British Treaty in May last year and the Soviet-Turkish Treaty in June, although it was agreed to launch a second front against Germany in Europe in 1942, Britain broke its promise and failed to do so. Also, at the Casablanca Conference in January, it was decided to prepare for a second front before September this year, but to this day, no new front has been opened to threaten the rear of the German army.</p>
<p>Second Front - Longing</p>
<p>Related to this second front issue is the post-war issue that the Soviet Union has frequently mentioned in recent statements. The post-war issues advocated by Britain and the United States are by no means the embodiment of the Soviet Union's war plans. For example, the recent article "On War Aims" published by Minilin in the Zhenli Bao magazine "War and the Working Class" clearly shows the Soviet Union's attitude towards the post-war issue. Minilin said, "We have no war aims, but even so, some British and American people are discussing war aims and putting them on par with the post-war issue. If the post-war issue is to be raised, then the Soviet Union, which accounts for one-sixth of the earth, should of course participate." He sharply expressed the Soviet Union's unique views on Southeast Europe, including the Balkans. When this direction of speech is combined with the request for a second front, we can fully see the Soviet Union's intentions in the future development of the war.

<h3>More Than 200,000 Italian Troops Completely Disarmed - Battleship "Roma" Sunk by German Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin, September 12th, Central News Agency - To date, more than 200,000 people in Italy have laid down their weapons. The Italian military detachments in Greece and other regions of Southeast Europe are not included. The number of Italian troops joining the German army cannot be announced. The number of Italian troops in mainland Italy and Southeast Europe who voluntarily accept the control of the German command is increasing daily. According to careful estimates, to date, at least 25 to 30 regiments and many special detachments, including paratroopers, anti-aircraft artillery defense forces, and motorized units, as well as their officers, have joined. Some of the Italian troops in various ports have also voluntarily accepted the control of the German authorities.</p>
<p>Lisbon, September 12th, Central News Agency - The Allied Headquarters in North Africa has just admitted that the Italian battleship "Roma" (35,000 tons) was sunk by German aircraft today when it attempted to escape to Malta. The ship was built on September 13, 1938, and was completed after the outbreak of the current war. It is the newest battleship, possessing nine 15-inch main guns, twelve 3.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, carrying three aircraft, and a crew of 1,600.</p>
<p>Algeciras, September 11th, Central News Agency - Spanish news agency reports: As of the afternoon of the 11th, no Italian warships or merchant ships were seen in the port of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 12th, Central News Agency - Havas News Agency military reporter Satorius said: After the Badoglio government of Italy surrendered to the enemy, the German army in Italy had a dual task. On the one hand, it had to disarm the Italian army, and its activities spread throughout Italy. If it encountered resistance from the Italian army, it had to overcome it after fierce fighting. On the other hand, it had to respond to the British and American forces landing in the south and occupy the coastal areas in time to prevent the enemy from landing in central and northern Italy. The events of the past 24 hours have proved that the German army has been able to grasp the situation. The work of disarming the Italian army has been largely completed and will soon be fully completed. More than one army corps of defense forces in Milan, Rome, and other places have all surrendered to the German army. Key areas such as Bora, Genoa, La Spezia, and the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Adriatic Sea have also fallen into the hands of the German army. At the same time, the German rearguard has successfully prevented the advance of the vanguard of the British Eighth Army in Calabria. The landing of British and American troops in the Gulf of Taranto has been met by the German army, and their actions have been hindered. At the same time, part of the German army under General Kesselring has begun to attack. The battle with the American Fifth Army landing in the Gulf of Salerno is as fierce as the battles in North Africa and Sicily. The Allied side has transferred the transport ship fleet that was originally sailing to other places for another landing to the Gulf of Salerno to assist in the battle. Enemy forces continue to land in the Gulf of Taranto and on the west coast of Apulia. It is estimated that the enemy forces will first occupy Apulia as a springboard for attacking the Balkans. It is still unknown whether the enemy forces there are reinforcements from the American Seventh Army or are mainly British troops. It is now known that the main force of the British Eighth Army is based in northern Calabria and is advancing along the west coast towards the Gulf of Salerno. One enemy force is planning to advance towards Taranto. The enemy's vanguard and the German rearguard are in contact. Generally speaking, the enemy has abandoned its original plan to maintain its main force three days ago and is now planning to land in southern Italy as much as possible. As for the German forces that have come into contact with the enemy, only a small number of troops. The main forces of General Kesselring and General Rommel are currently busy disarming the Italian army. This task is about to be completed, so a major battle may break out within days.</p>
<h3>Rommel Prepares for a Strong Resistance</h3>
<p>Berlin, September 12th, Central News Agency - German commander in northern Italy, General Rommel, is making plans for resistance in northern Italy and will soon be at peace. The enemy is still using its tanks, aircraft, and its great war machine and will encounter strong resistance.</p>
<h3>Minister Hagiwara Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 12th, Central News Agency</p>
<p>Major General Hagiwara, Director of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a speech on the 11th regarding the surrender of the Badoglio government of Italy to Britain and the United States. The main points of his speech were: "The world policy of Britain and the United States is to sacrifice other peoples in order to seek their own comfort, and to profit from the conflict between others. This is their golden rule. Therefore, they instigated China and Japan to fight each other in East Asia, and provoked Germany and the Soviet Union to fight in Europe. They use various tactics to exhaust the national strength of countries that hinder their world policy, and support the exiled governments of France, Poland, and Greece in Europe. This time, they are carrying out this conspiracy against Italy. The establishment of the Badoglio government is the most obvious example. Therefore, the surrender of the Badoglio government after the Italian coup is also the result of the British and American schemes. It is still remembered that in the late stage of World War I in 1918, Britain and the United States carried out extensive propaganda. According to British and American propaganda, it can be divided into five stages: public enlightenment, hopeful propaganda, propaganda of strife and opposition, and propaganda of inciting revolution. This time, they are repeating their old tricks on Italy, making the Italians feel desperate, creating war-weariness, and inciting the Italians to overthrow Mussolini and Fascism in order to achieve peace. Until recently, they forced Italy to surrender unconditionally, resulting in the Badoglio cabinet's betrayal of the Three-Power Alliance and the treaty of not making a separate peace, stopping the war against Britain and the United States, and taking hostile actions against Germany. This is not allowed by humans or gods. All of us in East Asia believe that the Badoglio faction is suffering from neurasthenia and mental illness due to the threat of war. They have left a stain on Italy's glorious history and caused their compatriots to shed blood in vain yesterday. The unconditional surrender of the Badoglio cabinet is despicable. However, Germany had long foreseen this and taken all necessary measures. After the Badoglio government defected, Germany has reduced a considerable burden in political and strategic terms, and can fully unleash its strength in future operations against Britain and the United States. However, as far as Chongqing is concerned, even if it stops resisting the war now in order to cope with the internal and external situations, it cannot be compared with the unconditional surrender of the Badoglio government, because the purpose of Chongqing's resistance has been achieved by the National Government. Because in the six years of Chongqing's resistance, Chairman Chiang has inherited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and abolished the unequal treaties. China's pursuit of independence and freedom has been realized. Today, what remains is only the joint effort of Greater East Asia and the nations of the world to build a new East Asia. Therefore, Chongqing should quickly participate in this great cause of the 20th century and jointly build East Asia."</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu's Speech on Inspecting the Situation in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, September 12th, Central News Agency - Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan, came to Guangdong from Nanjing on the 9th to inspect the situation in Guangdong Province. He arrived in the province on the afternoon of the 10th. At 2:30 p.m. on the 12th, he met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association branch and answered the questions raised by the reporters separately. The main points are as follows: Guangdong is the source of the revolution, and comrades working in all aspects of the party, government, and military are extremely busy. All parties have made considerable progress. I had already heard about it in Nanjing. This is due to the efforts of Governor Chen and other colleagues, as well as the cooperation of friends. Therefore, there have been good results in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. Although I have only been in Guangdong for three days this time, what I have seen and heard makes me feel that there has been great progress since my last visit to Guangdong. Now, I will summarize the questions raised by everyone and answer them as follows: Regarding the surrender of the Badoglio cabinet of Italy to Britain and the United States, we had already expected that the Badoglio cabinet of Italy would betray within three to five weeks after Prime Minister Mussolini resigned in late July. At that time, Badoglio stated that he would continue to resist the war, but it was only to prepare for the surrender. The betrayal of Badoglio this time is the same as the situation in Italy during the First World War and is not worthy of attention. It has no impact on the overall situation. At the same time, the Italian Fascist government has also been formally established in northern Italy. We are very pleased that well-known members of the Fascist Party will continue to work for the survival of Italy. The village cleansing work has now entered its third year. At the beginning, the village cleansing work was launched in Jiangsu Province. The National Government established a Village Cleansing Committee to handle everything, with Li Shiqun as the Secretary-General. Therefore, Li made great contributions to the village cleansing work. We deeply mourn his death this time. Later, the area of the village cleansing area was expanded to Zhejiang and Shanghai. This year, the village cleansing agency was transferred to the Executive Yuan, and the village cleansing work has been strengthened, people's livelihoods have been stabilized, public security has been ensured, and the people have been able to live and work in peace. The village cleansing work is continuing to be carried out, and the area will be further expanded. The New National Movement has now moved from theoretical propaganda to practice. The youth military movements and production increase movements in various places are very active, especially in Guangdong Province, where the results are the best. I had already heard about it in Nanjing. The training of young people in various schools can be said to be a model for the whole country. In this Greater East Asia War, the training of young people is an extremely important task. The authorities in various places are working hard to promote the production increase movement, and the results are also quite good. Therefore, since the National Government joined the war, due to the promotion and implementation of the New Movement, our country's human and material resources have been stronger than before. With this cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, the Greater East Asia War will be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Agricultural Agencies Placed Under the Management of the Department</h3>
<p>Jiaxing, September 12th, Central News Agency - The first high-level village cleansing zone in Zhejiang Province has entered the strengthening stage.

<h3>Thailand and Myanmar Issue Statements on the Surrender of the Badoglio Cabinet</h3>
<p>Bangkok, September 12th, Central News Agency - Prime Minister Phibun broadcast a speech on the evening of the 11th entitled "Thoughts on Italy," the main points of which are as follows: I express my deepest sympathy for the misfortunes of the Italian people. The collapse of Italy this time is due to the lack of unity among the Italian people. Therefore, Italy has become a battlefield for Germany and Britain and the United States, Germany and Italy, and even fellow countrymen to kill each other. The Thai people should unite to fight, overcome all difficulties and enemy strategies, and absolutely trust the leaders and the government to move towards the final victory.</p>
<p>Yangon, September 12th, Central News Agency - The Burmese government convened a special cabinet meeting on the 11th. All cabinet ministers, including Prime Minister Ba Maw, attended and reviewed the situation in Italy. A statement was issued in the afternoon as follows: "The unconditional surrender of the Badoglio government of Italy to Britain and the United States has no impact on the Burmese people's belief in final victory. In this great war, changes in the situation are inevitable, but the fundamental spiritual and material preparation is an indispensable requirement. This is the key to determining the final victory or defeat. Burma, based on this principle, is fighting together with Japan, Germany, and other allied countries. Only victory can preserve our existence. If the country does not exist, everything else will be reduced to nothing. Finally, for this serious situation, we will support Japan, which supports Burma's independence, and will do our best to achieve our common war goals and work together to the end."</p>

<p>The sale of the 46th period household rice has been set to end on the 15th, but the 47th period household rice slips have not yet been issued. As for the miscellaneous grains distributed in addition to the 45th period, because there are many grains such as sorghum, barley, oats, and red sorghum, etc., the citizens are not familiar with how to eat them, so less than 30% of the total number of people have collected them.</p>
<h3>Household Oil First Distributed in the Eighth District, Sales to Begin on the 15th</h3>

Residents can purchase four ounces of oil per person with their March-April property tax receipts and proof of identity. As for the remaining districts, it is said that the oil has not yet been fully delivered, so it will still take some time before it can be distributed.</p>
<h3>Teachers' Cooperative Requests Allocation</h3>
<p>Since the educational circles in this city initiated the establishment of consumer cooperatives, they have been widely praised by people from all walks of life. The educational circles in this city believe that it should not be delayed. They convened a discussion meeting yesterday and unanimously passed a resolution to publicly elect Jiang Chou as their representative to contact relevant parties regarding allocation and procurement matters, and decided to first request essential daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, sugar, and coal briquettes.</p>

<h3>The Serious Problem of Buying Books</h3>
<p>— Ao Ao</p>
<p>The Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers have enthusiastically managed the student aid movement, reducing the burden on many poor parents and relieving the suffering of many out-of-school children.</p>
<p>Tuition has been taken care of, but it is still not enough to study without books. Although the problem of books is much simpler and should not be a problem, the reality is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>We will not talk about the past, book fees are several times higher than before. We will temporarily ignore that as well. What deserves close attention at the moment is the doubling of prices on September 2nd.</p>
<p>A certain printing house, an authority in the book industry, and a certain bookstore, a leader in the pirated edition business, surprisingly implemented a complete "double price" for all textbooks starting on September 2nd. Although printing books with white paper was discounted by 30%, it is said that this 30% discount is only a temporary "favor," and soon there will be "no more 30% discount." In any case, books like Yilin Paper are guaranteed to double in price.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the purchase of gauze, all prices have been trending downstream, which is true. White paper and other papers also seem to be following the price limits and have not increased in price. To say that the price is doubled because of printing, binding, and other reasons does not seem to have sufficient reason.</p>
<p>A book that cost ten yuan now costs twenty yuan, and a book that cost fifty yuan now costs one hundred yuan. A semester that originally required buying five hundred yuan worth of books now requires one thousand yuan if bought on September 2nd. To say that such a shocking change in one day is still a legitimate profit, then we have nothing to say except to admire their previous willingness to sacrifice.</p>
<p>However, it seems that we should say something else. Poor students still have a special 10% discount, but how is this 10% discount calculated? Is adding one times the price and then discounting by 10% not the same as adding 80%?</p>
<p>Bookstores do not bear the direct responsibility of education, so they cannot be compared with schools, nor can they be dealt with in the same way as "school stores." However, in any case, they should be a part of the cultural industry. The rise and fall of the complex cultural industry is clearly closely related to this link, so it cannot be purely for profit. Reading is not entertainment, books are not cosmetics or luxury goods, and students are not profit-making objects. It seems that one should not be exploited in this way in order to obtain spiritual food.</p>
<p>We believe that there are many people of insight in the book industry, and there are many people with extremely high reputations in the education and cultural circles. We sincerely hope that they will automatically reduce the selling price, and we sincerely hope that the authorities will spare some energy from their busy schedule to correct this. We also hope that the public will closely monitor this. Although they do not have a direct stake in it, relatives and friends will always have children who need to buy books for their studies. We believe that with the force of supervision and attention, all distorted and unreasonable phenomena will be eliminated.</p>
<h3>After the Price of Cigarettes Increased, Profits Increased, and the Number of People Buying Rations Decreased</h3>
<p>The Thames News reports: Since the Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association increased the price of rationed cigarettes on September 9th, the queues in front of the cigarette exchange shops every morning when selling rationed cigarettes have almost completely disappeared. At the same time, black market activity in cigarettes has also decreased. As a result, the fixed market price method has also achieved results. According to the Thames News reporter, an investigation of various retail cigarette shops revealed that they are making considerable profits from cigarettes such as Daqianmen, Meili, and Laodao. At the same time, because the supply of goods has increased, domestic goods cannot be hoarded. After the price limit was raised, the profit margin of wholesalers increased from 5% to 7%, and the profit margin of retailers increased from 15% to 20%.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Letter to the Business Community</h3>
<p>To the attention of the industrial and commercial circles: Shanghai's industrial and commercial enterprises have always been prosperous. In the past, there were specially compiled and published directories such as credit directories, which were convenient for review. In recent years, there have been many new creations and changes, but there is still a lack of detailed investigation and systematic records. Moreover, due to the high cost of paper and labor, few new editions have been published, making it inconvenient to check and reference. This newspaper, in view of this, plans to start compiling a "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory," striving for comprehensive collection and accurate investigation. It has repeatedly received assistance from industrial and commercial associations and people from all walks of life, either by providing information or introducing surveys. However, the purpose of compiling this directory is to facilitate reference for the industrial and commercial circles, so the investigation records must be as detailed and accurate as possible. We hereby make another public announcement, requesting all factories, workshops, companies, and firms in this city (regardless of the size of capital or the scope of business, all industrial and commercial enterprises are welcome) to provide accurate survey information. The content of the information should mainly include the following items: Name, Address, Telephone, Telegraph, Mailbox, etc., Date of Establishment, Organization (company, partnership, sole proprietorship, etc.), Type of Business, Names of Important Officers, such as Chairman, Directors, Supervisors, Managers, Deputy Managers, Factory Directors, Directors, etc., Shop Owners, Shareholders, etc. Please provide detailed item-by-item information and send it directly to the "Industrial and Commercial Directory Information Department" of this newspaper so that it can be incorporated accordingly. From the standpoint of this newspaper, it can achieve the goal of being detailed and accurate. From the standpoint of industry and commerce, it not only indirectly promotes business but also gains recognition from all sectors, which is tantamount to free advertising. We firmly believe that people in the industrial and commercial circles will understand and be happy to assist. Compilation and printing are imminent. Please fill out and submit the information as soon as possible. Shen Bao News Agency respectfully announces.</p>

<h3>Ample Salt Allotment for Vegetable Industry; Approved by Salt Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Vegetable Bean Sprout Industry Association, after someone impersonated the association and was investigated by the authorities, has been approved by the Ministry order to maintain the original state. The chairman of the association, Chen Xialin, has been working tirelessly to rectify the association's affairs, sparing no effort. Recently, due to the soaring prices of vegetables and food in the market, the general public uses pickled vegetables as the main food to accompany meals. The reason for pickled vegetables is that they can not only save cooking oil and salt, but also can be eaten raw or cooked, and have become a popular food for the people. At this time, when fresh cabbage and snow vegetables are on the market, the general members of the association have been asking the association for salt by the jin for days in order to meet the needs of preparing for pickling. After learning of the situation, the chairman immediately presented the case to the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration for approval to register and allocate salt, which has been approved by the authorities to provide ample allocation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Market Conditions for Finance, Industry, and Commerce Last Week</p>
<p>Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions were generally lower last week. Also, with raised, there was still no normal transaction. Money supply, through the Central Bank and the United Reserve Bank, was supposed to be loosened as much as possible in the interbank lending business. But due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival settlement period, the balance of payments was still tight. The listed interest rate has always been 2.3 cents. Public bonds and stocks have slightly increased due to the situation. The market prices of various commodities have declined due to the increasingly tight control work of the authorities. The officially set market price for rice and sugar rationed per capita remained unchanged. People's hearts were calm, probably because the rationing was about to be implemented generally. In particular, the Rice and Grain Control Committee established by the authorities is actively preparing, and there will be responsible persons in charge of rice and grain regulation in the future, so the supply of people's food will not be lacking.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Organizes Zhejiang East Financial Investigation Group</h3>
<p>In order to develop trade in eastern Zhejiang, the banking industry decided to send representatives from the banking and money industry associations, together with relevant parties, to organize a Zhejiang East Financial Investigation Group to conduct on-site investigations in Jinhua first. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency recently learned from the financial community that the organization of the investigation group has become concrete, and the list of members has also been determined. They will go to Hangzhou and then to Jinhua from Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>Mass Life</p>
<h3>The Life of an Office Worker</h3>
<p>— Mu Tao</p>
<p>I am an employee of a public utility, and my monthly salary is only 430 yuan. In addition, the company gives each of us an extra rationed rice purchase certificate (this certificate can be used to buy 1.35 dou of whole rice at the price of household rice each month), but there are a total of four people in my family, and we all rely on this money to live each month. I have no other income, so I have to take on at least 400 yuan of debt each month!</p>
<p>It's really true that you don't know the price of firewood and rice until you're running a household. Seeing my two children always being very lively and playing all day long, but as a father, I have to think hard for several hours every night about the next day's life until I am unable to think, and then I fall asleep.</p>
<p>This kind of suffering of living in the ninth hour every night is really impossible to understand without experiencing it personally. Like my life in the past two years, I never dreamed of going out to see a movie once during holidays or free time to relieve boredom. I have never used side dishes to stop my children from crying. I have never thought about the worn-out and unfashionable clothes of myself and my family. In addition, if illness befalls any of my family members, I can only resign myself to fate and endure it.</p>
<p>I often hear people say that the best way to solve life's problems is to "increase income and reduce expenditure." In my current situation, there is nothing more to save in terms of expenditure, so I can only think of ways to increase income. Therefore, I would like to find a side job, hoping to earn more money to supplement the household. However, many things I have tried, they (the officials) have already prepared. The so-called recruitment, registration, interview, and other affairs are just for them to deal with the shareholders. I have also heard people in the examination room ask for things like "I can do without salary if I can get room and board." Naturally, people like me who need salary the most are the easiest to fail. My eloquence is not fluent, and I have little social interaction, so the business of being a guest is out of the question. My body is so weak that I went to Jiangwan to carry rice last winter. Although I made some money, I fell on the bed for several days after returning home. I don't dare to ask for advice on hard work from now on. At the same time, I am also too incompetent myself, and I have few friends to help me. Of course, it is more difficult than climbing to the sky if I want to achieve something.</p>
<p>This situation is definitely not common among my friends. They think that the life of an office worker is not so comfortable, at least it can be lived through, but I am worried and distressed all day long. I am afraid that the general public in the society can not understand it easily!</p>

<h3>The Yamazaki Unit on Attu Island: Eighteen Days and Nights of Heroic Battle; Courageous Spirit Even the Enemy Admired</h3>
<p>The heroic sacrifice of the Yamazaki Unit on Attu Island is sufficient to demonstrate the great spirit of the Imperial Army. This earth-shattering and soul-stirring battle truly inspired unparalleled fear in the American enemy and earned the admiration and praise of people worldwide. Unit Commander Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki, along with over two thousand officers and soldiers, must have been on that isolated island in the North Sea, with hearts of stone, fully believing in the victory of the Empire, and calmly sacrificed themselves. This reporter wishes to use my clumsy pen to recount the eighteen days and nights of the Yamazaki Unit's struggle at death's door, as a warning to those at home.</p>
<p>May 12, 1943, enemy aircraft began indiscriminate bombing from 2:00 AM. Ever since the Imperial Army occupied the island on June 8th of the previous year, the American forces, attempting to reverse their decline, relied on their superior number of aircraft to bomb the island day and night. The intensity, as the Yamazaki Unit described it, was like "Roosevelt's conviction," but the defending troops remained unmoved. The most intense bombing occurred on this day, May 12th. Unit Commander Yamazaki immediately realized that it was a prelude to enemy landing. He then issued an order:</p>
<p>Order to Mobilize All Troops</p>
<p>"All troops mobilize!"</p>
<p>Behind the high grounds everywhere, and hidden in the deep trenches, the soldiers prepared to kill the enemy. The wildfire in their hearts began to burn fiercely. The long-awaited final duel had finally arrived. The soldiers spontaneously shouted, "Americans, just you wait!" The enemy's bombing increased and intensified. At this time, the sky over the Aleutian Islands at 2:00 AM was already bright. On Attu Island, gradually brightening through the clouds and mist, due to the increasing distribution of propaganda by enemy aircraft, it felt as if the god of night had descended again. Countless enemy aircraft flew to our positions, dropping leaflets. They were ridiculous attempts to instigate surrender.</p>
<p>"Are the American soldiers going crazy? Take those leaflets back to Washington and sweep them away!"</p>
<p>Early that morning, soldiers monitoring the northern part of the island discovered a fleet of ships fully loaded with American soldiers advancing toward Holtz Bay in the fog. After receiving this report, Unit Commander Yamazaki immediately ordered all soldiers to deploy along the coast of the bay. At this point, the gunfire of both sides crisscrossed, and the rumbling of artillery shook the valleys. In an instant, Attu Island, slumbering in the mist, became a battlefield of decisive battle.</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, relying on their overwhelming advantage, the enemy concentrated a large number of boats in Massacre Bay on the southern part of the island, began to spread out and land, and engaged in fierce and brutal combat with our forces. At 7:00 PM, the American forces landing in Holtz Bay in the north of the island advanced along the west coast of the bay, engaging our first-line defensive units in close combat. Similarly, on the Massacre Bay side, the main enemy forces, after the initial landing, continuously increased their strength.</p>
<p>The attackers were aggressive, but the defenders did not show weakness. On the first (12th) and second days of the American landing, the Imperial Army truly demonstrated the unparalleled spirit of the Imperial soldiers. This was especially true for the annihilation battle carried out against the invading forces landing in the eastern part of the island. In the afternoon, our first-line defensive units discovered enemy forces moving in the fog and rushing towards the coast of Sarana Bay. The timid enemy soldiers, before even discovering us, had already wasted bullets. Our troops waited in silence. After a short while, enemy boats, one by one, approached the shore and prepared to land. We did not miss this excellent opportunity and opened fire on the enemy. The enemy soldiers, caught by surprise, fell in the boats, in the water, and on the beach. The screams of the American soldiers, the sound of gunfire, and the echoes of boats being blown up... it was simply a hell of wailing ghosts and howling wolves. The surviving American soldiers used the boats as shields and advanced towards us.</p>
<p>"Charge!"</p>
<p>The captain shouted this, and then first drew his sword and charged into the enemy ranks. The battle cries filled the beach.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the arrogant battle cry of "certain victory, certain conquest," the American soldiers, who had come from afar, saw this Japanese "human bullet" tactic, and charged left and right, attempting to escape. Our unrelenting mortars and bloody bayonet fighting caused the enemy to fall in disarray, crying out in pain. After ○ hours, no enemy soldiers could be seen on this beach.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the American forces, forgetting their miserable defeat of the previous day, again attempted to land in Sarana Bay. On this day, the confident Imperial Army also braved the artillery fire and repelled the enemy at the water's edge. From then on, until the Yamazaki Unit's complete sacrifice, the enemy dared not attempt to land again at Sarana Bay.</p>
<p>Frontal Night Assault Battle</p>
<p>In this critical situation, Unit Commander Yamazaki stubbornly defended the position, hoping to annihilate the enemy in the darkness of night and achieve a surprise attack. The nights in the Aleutian Islands come late and are short-lived. The intent was to use such a dark night to strike the enemy. After sunset, our army first launched a fierce attack against the enemy on the Massacre Bay front. The traditional night assault of the Imperial Army was fully and bravely demonstrated on this isolated island in the North Sea. Amidst the shouts of our army, the enemy's ranks were disrupted under the melee and bayonet fighting. The enemy soldiers fled in disarray, clutching their heads and screaming in pain. After such a night assault, the enemy retreated one to two kilometers.</p>
<p>The sky on the 13th, which was slightly less foggy than yesterday, allowed for visibility of three to four hundred meters on the ground. Because the enemy's landing on the eastern coast had been repelled twice yesterday, and three companies of enemy soldiers had been annihilated once on the southern coast, while our forces were facing the enemy on the northern and western coasts, our soldiers were in high spirits, with the strength to reach the stars.</p>
<p>From early on the 13th, the enemy again fired at us intensely, with bullets falling like rain. Artillery shells stirred up sand and stones, causing the valley to change completely in an instant. Our army often took the opportunity to launch surprise attacks, inflicting great losses on the enemy. The enemy's attacks on the southern coast were particularly fierce. Our troops decided to strike them hard first, thereby preserving the original position. At noon, the enemy launched a unified artillery bombardment from the northern and southern coasts, with the fiercest fire on the southern coast directed at the summit of Massacre Valley, strongly attacking our positions. The enemy had twice as many soldiers as we did, fired ten times as many bullets as we did, and had naval gun bombardment from the sea, which we lacked. Furthermore, there were aerial bombardments, which we also lacked. Our side, under such fire and bombardment on this day, still maintained its position and did not yield an inch. The enemy's attacks near the high ground in Holtz Bay in the northern part of the island were extremely fierce. Although our army suffered considerable losses, it did not retreat a step. Our army, occupying the high ground on the southern coast, faced off against the enemy entrenched on the northwest high ground of Massacre Bay, and as a result, two enemy companies were destroyed by our bombardment.</p>
<p>As night fell on the 13th, the enemy had reinforced many more troops on the northern coast, and they seemed to be well-trained in climbing mountains. At the same time, relying on their numerical superiority, they continued to advance. In Holtz Bay and Massacre Bay, enemy fleets, with battleships as flagships, moved back and forth, threatening our army. This phenomenon could be seen where the smoke dissipated.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Fled in Panic</p>
<p>At that time, a strange phenomenon occurred. Our guard units monitoring from the high ground in Massacre Bay on the southern coast saw enemy destroyers from that day on in Massacre Bay. The enemy warships were anchored, constantly bombarding our positions. At noon, one of the anchored destroyers suddenly began to move and quickly sailed towards the direction of the anchorage. Our troops thought that the enemy warship was moving to another location, but the enemy warship was rapidly moving towards the land.</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>None of our defending troops understood the mystery. At this moment, a tall and powerful column of water suddenly surged up on the port side of the enemy warship.</p>
<p>"Submarine!"</p>
<p>"Our submarine!"</p>
<p>Reinforcements had arrived from the sea. Our submarine fired torpedoes from the sea. The enemy warship ran aground on the beach close to shore.</p>
<p>At the same time, a similar phenomenon of warship running aground occurred in Holtz Bay on the northern coast. This was when the enemy fleet was carrying out a fierce bombardment of our positions. Suddenly, next to the enemy warship, a towering column of water shot up, followed by another one. This massive enemy warship, like an island, began to tilt and flee towards the ocean, disappearing into the mist in an instant. The remaining enemy warship fleet immediately became disorganized and began to scatter in confusion. The enemy warship fleet, which had thought it had the upper hand, sailed back and forth triumphantly, arbitrarily bombarding our positions, and was actually sent fleeing in panic by our invincible submarine. Our submarine bravely overcame the most difficult natural conditions and came to Attu Island from thousands of miles away to fight the enemy. By May 24th, it had damaged one battleship and one cruiser.</p>
<p>All-Out Bayonet Charge</p>
<p>From the 1st to the 15th, although there were fierce battles every day, our army maintained its original position. Although the enemy outnumbered us tenfold, we only suffered dozens of casualties in four days. The enemy continued to increase its forces. On the southern coast, soldiers were constantly landing. The enemy's strength gradually increased to more than ten times our own, and they used ○ artillery pieces to suppress us. The defending troops in that area were determined to fight to the last drop of blood and stop the enemy's advance. On that day, the enemy's front-line troops charged over and engaged us in hand-to-hand combat. Unit Captain ○ also believed that continuing to stalemate like this was simply a suicidal act of waiting for death, so he prepared to order all troops to launch a general bayonet charge. Everyone tightly wrapped white bands around their sleeves, tied white cloths over their heads, and fixed their bayonets, waiting for the opportunity to charge. The all-out charge began. Battle cries echoed through the valleys. When bayonets broke, they grabbed the enemy and bit their throats. Although the enemy was hit hard by our attacks, due to the overwhelming numerical disadvantage, our northern high ground defending troops all bravely sacrificed themselves.</p>
<p>On the 16th, the enemy continued to land on the southern coast, and enemy tanks appeared on the summit of Massacre Valley. Our troops in the eastern part of Holtz Bay again launched a night attack, causing confusion in the enemy camp.</p>
<p>On the 17th, enemy aircraft came to bomb at 5:00 AM. North American B-25 aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs on their own positions. This accidental bombing caused the enemy to suffer great losses.</p>
<p>On the 18th, land battles were still very fierce, and the enemy air force and navy continued to carry out intimidating attacks. Enemy soldiers continued to land in Massacre Bay. A mixed battle between the enemy and us unfolded on the northern coast.</p>
<p>On the 19th, enemy aircraft flew in to bomb from early in the morning and continuously dropped supplies and ammunition by air. This was the first time this had happened since the American landing, and this proved that our submarine's activities were effective, causing difficulties in the enemy's maritime supply replenishment.</p>
<p>On the 20th, our army launched a counterattack while the enemy was advancing inland. As a result, the two sides became entangled in the most tragic melee and grappling combat.</p>
<p>Reinforcements: Sea Eagles Arrive</p>
<p>After the 20th, the enemy's troop reinforcements came to an end. On the 21st and 22nd, our army bravely attacked Massacre Bay. Although the enemy suffered great losses, our losses also increased.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, when we heard the sound of airplanes, we thought that the enemy was coming to bomb again, but when the airplanes flew closer, we saw that they were Japanese airplanes. Our sea eagles soared in the sky, and the officers and soldiers of the Yamazaki Unit waved their hats, shed hot tears, and shouted "Banzai!" In an instant, our sea eagles flew towards the enemy warships in Chichagof Harbor to drop bombs. Aerial torpedoes were dropped, and one enemy warship caught fire and sank to the bottom of the sea in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Our soldiers on the ground suddenly cheered, "Banzai! Banzai!" The results of our sea eagles that day were one cruiser sunk, one destroyer sunk, and another one on fire.</p>
<p>The arrival of our sea eagles was simply a mystery to the Americans, who did not know where they had come from. Our Yamazaki Unit cheered them as "millions of reinforcements."</p>
<p>Unit Commander Yamazaki was constantly preparing for a counterattack, stubbornly defending his own position. The artillery gunners and engineers all picked up rifles and launched attacks.</p>
<p>On the 24th and 25th, enemy aircraft did not come, and only a few warships bombarded our positions. This was due to the activities of our submarines and air force. Unit Commander Yamazaki took advantage of this opportunity to reorganize and strengthen the army. Our sea eagles flew in and dropped a lot of food and ammunition.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the enemy's attacks were extremely fierce. Unit Commander Yamazaki already knew that this was the final battle. At this time, Unit Commander Yamazaki's communications were cut off, so amidst the hail of bullets, he recorded the enemy's strength, tactics, equipment, etc., that day, and reported it to his superiors.</p>
<p>Since the 25th, due to the enemy's fierce attacks, our unit's strength had been reduced to only a hundred and several dozen men. At this time, the only option was to give the enemy a fatal blow. Maintaining our own forces in the position and confronting the enemy for a long time was not a viable option. That would cut off supplies and lose the opportunity to strike the enemy hard. Rather than eking out a miserable existence on this isolated island, it was better to sacrifice oneself valiantly. So, he reported this decision to his superiors and destroyed important documents.</p>
<p>"Tonight, we will definitely carry out a final night assault. Please conduct aerial reconnaissance of the results of tonight's attack." This was the Yamazaki Unit's final tragic report. From then on, no matter how they called the Attu Island radio station, there was no response. This was because the radio station had been destroyed. Wounded and sick soldiers committed suicide by disembowelment with a smile on their faces. Unit Commander Yamazaki gathered the remaining soldiers and gave a final farewell speech.</p>
<p>"When bullets run out, use bayonets. If bayonets break, use your hands. If your hands are injured, use your teeth. In short, kill as many enemies as possible. Even when your heart stops beating, your soul must still charge into the enemy ranks."</p>
<p>After speaking, he led all the officers and soldiers to pay their respects to the Emperor in the direction of the Imperial Palace. Firearms were also distributed to non-combatant military personnel. The faces covered in soot were full of smiles. On the night of May 29, 1943, they desperately charged towards the American positions on the summit of Massacre Valley. This superhuman and supernatural power of the Imperial Army shocked the American soldiers. According to enemy intelligence, fierce fighting continued until June 2nd. Although the Yamazaki Unit parted ways with the world on June 2, 1943, its spirit will forever remain immortal.

<h3>Burning Books</h3>
<p>— Yeren</p>
<p>Two years ago, my uncle startled me by sending me to the Yueying-style firm as an apprentice. I didn't know anything, and when I started working, I was ridiculed by my colleagues; that was still alright. What I found most painful was—the firm forbade me from reading books!</p>
<p>At first, I didn't know the rules of the firm and brought my beloved books to the firm, but I didn't dare to read them in front of so many people. I only secretly read them in a small room behind the loan warehouse. One day, a colleague who was my closest friend told me:</p>
<p>"Xian, be careful not to let people tell the manager. It's not a joke; you'll definitely get a 'scolding'. There used to be a colleague who liked reading books like you, and after being scolded by the manager, he left that very night!" But I said:</p>
<p>"Thank you for your advice. But reading books is always better than going to dance halls or brothels..."</p>
<p>One afternoon, I was reading a book in a small room behind the warehouse again. Just as I was enjoying it, the manager suddenly appeared behind me like a bolt from the blue, and said loudly:</p>
<p>"I've been calling you for a long time. So you're here reading books, having a good time!" Then he snatched the book from my hand and tore it to pieces. How heartbroken I was! It was as if I had lost a treasure. But the scolding continued ruthlessly.</p>
<p>"Did we bring you here to learn business or to read books? If you're here to learn business, you should throw away the book and focus on learning business. If you're here to read books, you should go back home. We don't want people like you here!"</p>
<p>I remembered the words my mother told me when I left home: "Axiang! Be good and follow others' example, listen to the boss, and never be too proud. Pride will lead to suffering..." Unconsciously, tears welled up in my eyes, and from then on, I dared not read books during the day.</p>
<p>For two or three weeks, I didn't read any books, and I felt very bored, even worse than not having food to eat. One night, after my colleagues had gone to sleep, I quietly turned on a five-watt lamp and opened a book that I hadn't read for many days. I was reading under the dim light, and my heart couldn't help but beat nervously. Half a year passed like this. One night, as usual, after my colleagues had gone to sleep, I turned on the lamp and read under the light. My eyes became blurred, and I gradually fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning, I realized that the lamp was still on, and several colleagues had already woken up and were staring at me.</p>
<p>"No matter how Uncle scolds him, this little devil is still not afraid. He keeps the light on so brightly in the middle of the night, preventing me from sleeping last night. I'll definitely tell Uncle today and give him a lesson..." said Afang, the manager's nephew.</p>
<p>Sure enough, that morning, as soon as the manager came out, he called me into the accounting room and asked me if I read books every night. I just stared at him blankly without saying a word, so he shouted angrily:</p>
<p>"Why don't you answer when I ask you something? You're a blockhead—Afang, go and get all the books hidden on Xiang's bed."</p>
<p>When Afang walked into the accounting room with a pile of books and sneered at me, I really wanted to rush over and bite him a few times.</p>
<p>"What now? Let's burn the books!" he asked me coldly. I didn't answer. "Burn them all!" the manager said.</p>
<p>Afang lit a match and set the books on fire. Watching the books that I had accumulated and bought over the past six months being swallowed by the fire one by one and turning into ashes, I felt infinite anger and grief in my heart. Suddenly, the manager sneered, stroking the old whiskers on his mouth and saying to me:</p>
<p>"Haha, does it hurt? Now you have no books to read, oh, haha..."</p>
<p>The last sentence was said very mockingly.</p>
<p>But the next day, my uncle called me in and lectured me.</p>
<p>"From now on, you are not allowed to read books in the firm... Do you hear me?"</p>
<p>Returning from my uncle's place, I still didn't understand: What harm is there in reading books?</p>
<p>In this way, I lost a spiritual treasure and became a soulless burden! I don't know when I will be able to enjoy the taste of reading again!</p>
<h3>To Lin</h3>
<p>— Song Lan</p>
<p>I'm going to be hospitalized tomorrow. I have to have surgery at night. I feel very lonely and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Last night, my father came and talked to me with a stern face: "First, after you leave the hospital the day after tomorrow, you can only stay in a third-class ward. Don't spend too much money. I've signed the papers, and I won't have time to visit you later. Second, you can't come home. I don't care where you live outside. Third, you have to get married this year, otherwise, I won't have the money to marry you off later. I can't help it. You can't say I'm unfair."</p>
<p>After my father left, I couldn't control my emotions. I covered my face and cried bitterly. My tears flowed out uncontrollably. I could only sob. I opened my tearful eyes and asked people, "Was that my father who just came?" People said I was silly, but I wondered: Am I my father's child? How was the three-year married life that my mother, who died at the young age of twenty-two, spent with my father? These are all mysteries!</p>
<p>At night, I stood weakly on the balcony. The early autumn evening breeze licked my short hair with a soft tongue, the white crescent moon kissed my cheeks with gentle lips, letting the stars wink their quiet eyes and smile, letting the beautiful and deep night sigh mysteriously. I caressed the scars in my heart and opened the history of my life...</p>
<p>Lin: Where are you now? We've been separated for more than half a year. You're wandering everywhere, traveling north and south; I'm drifting in a foreign land, falling to the ends of the earth. Now, illness brings me pain and loneliness. My father is cold to me, others don't care about me, no one understands me, and no one loves me sincerely. I think of you with tears in my eyes, but I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you? Haven't you seen that spring has gone again and autumn has come? The blood and tears of the azaleas, the distant neighing of horses, bring me so much sadness!</p>
<p>Ah! Tell me, when will we meet again? My love!</p>
<p>I remember in early spring, when I was sick, you left me. We separated so abruptly, without a word, without a goodbye. We didn't even shake hands. We parted silently in the endless night. I seemed to see your tearful eyes, but I closed my eyes in pain, and when I opened them again, you were gone.</p>
<p>When will I return to your side? We have never lain together. You have a sacred career, and I have heavy duties. I am still trapped in two different worlds. I want a mother, but my mother is dead; I want a father, but my father doesn't treat me like his daughter; I want you, but where are you? ...</p>
<h3>Small Songs of Life</h3>
<p>— Lan Yi</p>
<p>Dusk</p>
<p>The setting sun, with a reddened face, struggles with its last strength; peace, white clouds are stained with a faint red; it vaguely resembles—red, bloody clouds. × × × × it fades! Weakens! Defeated. The twilight quietly scatters the color of peace; - the shadow of the blue angel will be the final master.</p>
<p>Caged Bird</p>
<p>Another caged bird quietly rushes towards the free sky. It evokes even more - emotional waves; waves, waves, even more showing a lonely feeling during the war. × × ×</p>
<p>Shooting Star</p>
<p>Stars, the Milky Way, the shadow of the moon, shining on the blue curtain; like shattered jewels. Suddenly - a shooting star passes by; remorse, panic, with a trembling tail, alertly - a flash of inspiration; I realize that this is life. (Moved-Paid Assistant Loan)</p>
<h3>Faces</h3>
<p>— Zheng Men</p>
<p>If we, from birth to death, do not go out into society to work, but live our whole lives in the home, then all you see every day are just a few familiar faces. The faces of parents are always kind and benevolent; the faces of daughters are always innocent and lovely; and the faces of those who depend on you are always subservient and flattering. But if we work in a shop as a clerk, that is not the case. Every day you can see many different faces, which is quite uncomfortable. The first face that you see and makes you feel different is the venerable visage of the boss's wife. When the shop assistant is taking a customer, the boss's wife is supervising from the side, and her visage is fickle. If the shop assistant cannot make the sale, the boss's wife's face will turn ashen.</p>
<p>Next, you have to see the various different faces of the customers. Some are very amiable or lovable, but some have a face full of aggression, with eyes wide open, and their faces look like they are looking for trouble.</p>
<p>Faces! Faces! Why are they so infinitely varied?</p>
<h3>Mr. Cheng's Anguish</h3>
<p>— Ji Wei Yi</p>
<p>On a Sunday afternoon, the stove was blazing, and Mr. Cheng sat dejectedly in his small attic room, thinking and thinking... The front building was a children's paradise, full of joy and laughter, while the attic room, though stuffy and hot, was comparatively quiet. Therefore, it was regarded as a blessed sanctuary, Mr. Cheng Guang-sheng's only free space.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, Mr. Cheng, through the introduction of an important person, left that barely-surviving, never-satiated profession and stepped into the enviable real estate company, throwing a heavy stone in his heart far, far away... He was full of hope that he could barely manage to settle his life. But now, not only could he not afford the new clothes he had planned to gradually acquire, but even his existing old clothes were difficult to preserve. There was one matter he could not resolve.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is Mrs. Cheng's birthday... Please... honor us with your presence... Ha... please come early... The sixteenth... to join in the fun..." Yesterday, the manager, with a forced smile, said these words with a face full of smiles, and they rang in his ears again. Needless to say, a contribution cannot be avoided, and moreover, those colleagues...</p>
<p>"Hey"! Mr. Liu, the manager's relative, was already thinking about flattering and currying favor. "Should we all send birthday peaches and cakes?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Count me in... about two hundred yuan each... not expensive, not expensive: and also send a separate gift each... Ha!" Mr. Wang, the manager's nephew, chimed in, even more aggressively.</p>
<p>"Oh, heavens!" Mr. Cheng thought to himself, "It looks like another 40% of this month's salary will be deducted, and my wife and children at home are waiting for food..."</p>
<p>"Old Wang, how much are you preparing for mahjong tomorrow: Ha... three thousand? Not enough, right! Ha..." Someone else was preparing for tomorrow's merriment, which deeply pained Mr. Cheng's heart. In his blurred vision, he vaguely saw Mr. Wang's fingers go from three to four to five... Without realizing it, Mr. Cheng shed a precious tear.</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Originally, such good weather today was rare. Usually, he would happily take the children to the park. But today was different, he really couldn't muster any enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Thinking of himself sitting quietly in the sweat-filled attic room, entirely to avoid those social obligations. Going to the banquet was unavoidable, but he thought he would not participate in the merriment. Perhaps even if he searched his whole family, he couldn't gather a thousand yuan. So, he was painfully trying to stay home until the banquet started.</p>
<p>The only long gown he planned to wear to the banquet today was being mended by his wife in the front building. Shoes... he only had one pair for rainy days... He would have to go bareheaded! Shoes... thinking of shoes, he remembered the incident at the shoe store that day, he seemed to hear:</p>
<p>"Get out! Go away! Asking the price when you can't afford shoes... Make a fortune and come back to buy! ... Ha..."</p>
<p>A wave of stinging coldness rushed through his mind, and his heart felt as if cold arrows were deeply shot into his defenseless and weak heart.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Xu Huiguang</p>
<p>Waste of Life</p>
<p>Regarding the waste of life, I have long had this thought. I remember discussing it with classmates not long ago. I said: "Life is like morning dew. Few people can enjoy a long life of eighty or ninety years, and one-third of that life is spent on the bed due to illness, one-third is spent on rest and eating, and a lot of time is wasted on worrying and anxiety. The time truly spent on serving society and serious work only accounts for a small part of an individual's life. As for those young masters and ladies who loaf around and spend their days in games and amusements, they simply throw their lives away! — So sometimes I feel that life is inherently wasteful!" Although I spoke with some coherence back then, now I feel even more intensely that although an individual's service to society and contributions to the community only account for a small part of their life, precisely because of this, this small part of life is even more precious to us! Only through the ordinary can we express greatness, and it is difficult to avoid the waste of life. That small part of life used to serve society and the community deserves our utmost care and cherish!</p>
<p>Self-reflection</p>
<p>"If one season is missed, one may suffer hunger; if one woman is idle, one may suffer cold." These two sentences precisely express that although an individual's strength is small, the atoms that make up society and the nation are individuals. Therefore, whether it is a farmer plowing or a weaver weaving, although they are engaged in ordinary work, their contribution to society is no less than what great men do. From this, we can see that diligent and practical work is truly better than lofty and empty words, which are of no practical use. This is a major weakness of people.</p>
<p>"Sitting and talking is not as good as getting up and acting!" I want to advocate.</p>

<h3>Shanghai YMCA's Efforts to Promote Sports: Using Sports to Replace Unwholesome Entertainment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Christian Association (YMCA) has been promoting sports for thirty to forty years. It can be said that the YMCA founded various sports in Shanghai. The goal of the YMCA's sports work is to emphasize adapting to the needs of the times, promoting healthy physical, mental, and psychological activities, correcting the current distorted development of the sports world, improving sports ethics, widely introducing various sports, and hoping to use sports-style entertainment to replace all abnormal entertainment in society. It holds various gymnastics classes, basketball, volleyball, and swimming classes; and trains junior sports technical personnel in large numbers to promote the popularization of sports. In order to increase public interest and popular awareness, it concentrates outstanding athletes to organize ball game competitions and sports performances. Over the decades, many athletes in Shanghai have been trained by the YMCA or are teammates of the YMCA's various sports teams. The following is a brief introduction to the YMCA's current sports activities:</p>
<p>Sports Facilities Regarding facilities, the Sichuan Road branch of the YMCA has a gymnasium that can be used for all kinds of gymnastics and basketball competitions. It has two handball courts, where famous players such as Zhu Kuan often practice or compete. It has a swimming pool, which, although small, has a long history. Countless people have learned to swim here. In addition, there are separate bathing rooms and dressing rooms for adults, teenagers, and women, a ping-pong game room, and a billiard room. The Eight Immortals Bridge branch of the YMCA has a larger gymnasium. Although the building is somewhat simple, it is currently the largest and most standard indoor sports hall in Shanghai, so various basketball and volleyball games in Shanghai are often held here. There is a sports area dedicated to various weightlifting equipment and individual exercises. There is a national martial arts hall located on the top floor of the YMCA, with excellent construction and equipment. In addition, there is a health treatment room and three bathing rooms, all fully equipped.</p>
<p>Organizational Structure The YMCA's sports staff organization has the Sports Committee as the highest organization. The chairman of the committee is Mr. Shen Dunliang, a director of the YMCA. The committee members are Zhou Jiaqi, Kang, Yu Xunzi, Wang Shoufang, Dao, and other members. Mr. Liang Zhaoan is in charge of the YMCA's sports department, responsible for all sports matters, and also teaches gymnastics and swimming. Mr. He Hesheng is responsible for YMCA member sports and organizing various ball game competitions. Mr. Chen Fuzhang is in charge of the YMCA's middle school sports work. There are also many coaches and instructors for each class, which cannot be introduced one by one.</p>
<p>Sports Trends The YMCA's recent sports trends are also noteworthy, namely that the YMCA's sports activities include the following three types of education: sports education, health education, and recreational education. Sports education includes various gymnastics, ball game training, ball game competitions, national martial arts, boxing, wrestling, swimming, etc., with the pure goal of training physique and skills. Health education includes health campaigns, health exhibitions, vaccinations, health competitions, physical examinations, physical fitness tests, health treatments, bathing, etc., all of which are carried out in this area. As for recreational education, such as hiking, cycling, billiards, ping-pong, group dancing, etc., these are all sports with recreational elements.</p>
<p>Various Classes and Groups Based on the above three principles, the YMCA currently has many classes, teams, and small organizations. Participants are assigned according to their level, and those receiving basic or ordinary training enter the "classes," such as equipment classes, after-work classes, guard classes, wrestling classes, bodybuilding classes, boxing classes, beginner swimming classes, etc., all of which receive short-term training to teach various basic skills. After completing the training, those who wish to receive long-term training and more advanced skills can participate in various "teams," such as morning exercise teams, bodybuilding teams, swimming teams, boxing clubs, etc., which are competitive in nature and represent the YMCA in various competitions, such as the Zhongqing basketball team, the Zhongqing swimming team, and the boxing team. Other special organizations include referee training classes, inviting various types of competitions, boxing competitions, indoor sports, sports lectures, health competitions, etc., which are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Ball Games Regarding ball games, as mentioned earlier, the Shanghai YMCA is the pioneer, so the YMCA's gymnasium has the most participants in ball games, especially basketball, which is most popular among the public. In addition to ordinary members who regularly practice, almost all the players of famous local teams, such as Yu Xunzi, Kong Guangyi, Zhuo Guorong, Chen Xue, Ma Canxi, and the Renyu Hualian team, the Chenyou team, etc., often run in the gymnasium. Every autumn, the YMCA holds the "YMCA Member Cup" ball game competition, which only YMCA members can participate in, but many famous Shanghai players are YMCA members, so it is always a grand event.</p>
<p>Water Sports The YMCA has made unremitting efforts to promote water sports. Every summer, it opens the swimming pool and charges a very low subsidized fee so that the public can participate. The swimming pool adopts a group swimming method, so it can provide technical training to participants. Last year and this year, about 3,500 people participated, of whom 1,500 were beginners. Famous Shanghai swimmers such as Wen Jingling, Xu Shouqiang, Lu Huijie, Chen Xiaozhong, and Wang Zhongcheng are all members of the Zhongqing swimming team and also serve as instructors, so learners are very enthusiastic. The organization and training are divided into four types of classes and groups: Beginner Swimming Class, where those who cannot swim are taught in six sessions. Intermediate Swimming Class, which teaches various swimming styles and diving. Intermediate Swimming Team, which trains various advanced swimming techniques. Self-Practice Swimming Class, which does not limit the level and allows free practice. Other events held in phases include swimming performances, swimming tests, and swimming competitions. This year's Shanghai Chinese Open Swimming Competition is an unprecedented event.</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA is a Christian organization. Sports work is one of the four aspects of education (moral, intellectual, physical, and social) of the YMCA, so its promotion of sports is also based on the YMCA's purpose of serving society and cultivating talents, and it has the spirit of Christ. This is what distinguishes it from other organizations. (Weinas)</p>
<h3>Major Events in the Shanghai Sports World: Western Football Club Dissolves, Sino-Foreign Football Matches Taken Over by the Municipal Sports Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Football Club (formerly known as the Shanghai Western Football Association) announced its dissolution on September 10th. From now on, Sino-foreign football matches will be taken over by the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association. This is indeed a major event in the Shanghai sports world this past week, and also a major change in the Shanghai football world in more than forty years. It was initiated and organized, and registered in London, with the initiation taking place in 1902. At that time, the Ascot Cup was started, and the first championship was won by the Docker Engineering Association; Lacks, Western Merchants, and Shangtuan A teams were all major participants in the competition.</p>
<p>In 1907, the A-League began, and the International Cup was held the following year. Subsequently, the Zi Lin Cup, Gao Bei Cup, Junior Cup, Reserve Cup, A, B, C, and D League were held in turn. In short, twenty years ago, the Shanghai football world was dominated by teams such as Scotland, England, Ireland, Four Merchants, Lacks, and St. Francis.</p>
<p>Chinese teams joined the Shanghai Football Club in 1926, with Shen Siliang and others joining the association as officials. In 1927, Lehua won both the Senior Cup and the A-League championship. In 1933, Youyou won the Junior Cup, and the following year, Donghua won the Ascot Cup and the Junior Cup. After the Chinese team participated in the International Cup, it won the championship for two consecutive years in 1928 and 1929.</p>
<p>From last year to the present, the Shanghai Football Club has been chaired by Kang Bosun, and continues to hold the Ascot Cup, Zi Lin Cup, Junior Cup, and A, B, and C League, but the scope is smaller and the vitality is greatly reduced. Last Friday (September 10th) at 5 pm, the association held its annual meeting at the Huizhong Hotel. Attendees included Chairman Kang Bosun, vice-chairmen and executives, appeal committee members, and representatives of various teams, totaling more than thirty people. Chairman Kang Bosun reported on the past cup games, and continued to report on the income and expenditure of the accounts, with an income of more than 340,000 yuan. After paying the secretary Lei Yanshi's annual salary of 10,000 yuan and telephone and miscellaneous expenses of 9,000 yuan, the cash balance was only 118 yuan and change. Chairman Kang Bosun then proposed, and Executive Dello concurred, that in order to adapt to the environment, the Shanghai Football Club should announce its dissolution, and all association affairs and all proceedings, as well as assets and powers, should be transferred to the Shanghai Sports Association for acceptance and continued operation. The attending committee members unanimously passed the motion. From now on, the term "Western Football Club" has become a historical relic. It is reported that the Municipal Sports Association is already preparing to continue handling Shanghai football competitions.</p>
<h3>Three-Province Women's Volleyball Team: Victory in Debut, Defeating Huayan Two to One</h3>
<p>The Three-Province Women's Volleyball Team, which has not been established for long, made its debut yesterday (September 11th), challenging the Huayan team at the Three-Province Sports Association's sports field on Julafales Road. The Three-Province team took the lead, winning the first game with a score of 22 to 20. The Huayan team was not willing to concede defeat, and recovered lost ground with a score of 20 to 18. In the final decider, the Three-Province team worked hard and attacked desperately, winning the final victory with a score of 21 to 17. In terms of merits and demerits in this match, Chen Meizhen of the Three-Province team should be credited with the first merit, attacking and blocking balls, and defeating the enemy to the death. Li Bo, Wang Fuzhi, and Shi Ruijuan were all not weak. Huayan lost Wen Pei, who had the demeanor of a true man. The smashing was powerful and undeniable. Shi Jing also had a good performance. The referee was Mr. Lu Xiangqian, who abandoned ball games to go into business.</p>
<p>Three-Province Team: Chen Meizhen, Li Bo, Wang Fuzhi, Wang Shijuan, Zhao Jichen, Lu Cuifang, Chen Zhuang, Wang Shifang, Tao Yaying, Hu Xian, Chen Yang, Zhou Ying, Liu Zan, Shi Ruijuan, Ma Ruichen, Zhang Pingfu, Chen Di</p>
<p>Huayan Team: Qian Jiajun (Shi Jing), Rong Guoaihua, Zhou Xiaochun, Xu Lingxian.</p>

<h3>Simple Fitness Training Method (II)</h3>
<p>— Written by Yide Translated</p>
<p>7. Automatic Chest</p>
<p>The automatic chest is necessary for correct breathing and perfect health. The so-called automatic chest refers to the upper part being raised and fixed, not rising or falling with breathing; when breathing involuntarily, it is as firm as iron, and even when breathing voluntarily, it remains fixed, even during strenuous exercise or loud shouting.</p>
<p>Place both hands on the chest, making the chest passive. The lower part of the chest sinks, as if there is nothing in the chest. Then, use the muscles to lift it, without using the force of inhaling.</p>
<p>By practicing this, you will soon know how little muscle movement and how much attention is needed to make the chest automatic, without the need for constant special force and special attention.</p>
<p>This should also become second nature. But do not overdo it, lest the chest become stiff and lose its balance, which would be unsightly.</p>
<p>8. Breathing</p>
<p>Do not breathe through the mouth. Dogs breathe through the mouth by nature, which is not suitable for humans to imitate.</p>
<p>Correct breathing requires correct posture. Stand upright, leaning the body forward, not backward. Do not bend the body, but lean forward from the ankle joint, without rigidity. Maintain the automatic (raised and fixed) chest, with the knees, hips, and abdomen backward; the body's center of gravity should be forward, entirely on the balls of the feet, so although the heels are still on the ground, the weight they bear is very light.</p>
<p>Even if you place your fingers under the heels, they will not be injured.</p>
<p>9. Diaphragmatic Breathing</p>
<p>This includes abdominal, rib, and costal breathing, i.e., front, back, and side, each of which must be discussed separately.</p>
<p>During the following breathing exercises, the body should not have any other movements except for the movement of the chest and waist. The upper part of the chest is raised and fixed. Use the force of muscle movement, not the force of inhalation; maintaining this position is very important, as if preparing to be punched in the chest, so you should always pay attention to it, so that it is firmly in your mind and cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p>10. Abdominal Breathing</p>
<p>The term abdominal breathing is easily misunderstood, so it must be explained. Practicing abdominal breathing often has significant effects, which is well known. In fact, the abdomen does not breathe, nor does the chest, but there are often terms such as abdominal breathing and chest breathing.</p>
<p>Correct abdominal breathing is a strong and beneficial exercise. When the diaphragm contracts, it presses on the stomach and liver below, which can promote digestion. The term abdominal breathing comes from the forward movement of the abdomen when inhaling.</p>
<p>Stand upright in the correct posture. (When practicing abdominal breathing, the correct posture has often become second nature.)</p>
<p>Place the fingertips in the center of the waistline. Slowly inhale a deep breath through the nostrils. Raise the chest. Keep it fixed. Below where the fingers are placed, there is almost no movement. The lower part of the abdominal wall also does not need to have any movement. When starting to inhale, you should feel a forward movement of the abdomen resisting the fingers. Slowly inhale, and when the lungs are full, keep the diaphragm still, pause for a moment, and then slowly exhale.</p>
<p>Abdominal breathing: Place hands on the abdomen; inhale, resist the diaphragm movement, and slowly exhale.</p>
<p>Note: When practicing in class, three breaths are sufficient; when practicing individually, you can use your own judgment.</p>
<p>11. Rib Breathing</p>
<p>Stand upright in the correct posture. Place the back of the fingers on the lower ribs. Slowly inhale a deep breath through the nostrils. The upper part of the chest is raised and fixed. When starting to inhale, you should feel a lateral movement resisting the fingers.</p>
<p>Rib breathing: Place hands on the lower ribs; inhale; resist the diaphragm movement; and slowly exhale.</p>
<p>Note: When practicing in class, three breaths are sufficient; when practicing individually, you can use your own judgment. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Rib breathing Abdominal breathing</p>
