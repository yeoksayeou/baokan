<h3>切實保障公務員生活</h3>
<p>有治法，不可無治人。因爲有治法而無治人，則治法決不能貫澈，不過多了一紙具文而已。參戰以來，國府積極樹立戰時體制，一切戰時的治法，差不多已經「應有盡有」了。但最重要的問題，還是治人問題，就是誰去執行這些治法」的問題。無庸置疑的，今日政府在某一定的限度內說，是已經努力於人才主義之實施的。但同時還有兩個問題：第一，現有的「治人」，尤其是中下級的公務人員，是否能安心盡忠於新政策之執行？第二，在政府外面，很多的人才，如果不能集中到國策的周圍，一致協力於國策之推行，那麼，一切治法」的前途又將如何？對於這兩個問題，我們還找不出滿意的答案。爲什麽？原因雖然很多，而一般公務人員實際生活之無保障，是最直得重視的一點。因此我們於呼籲改善公務員生活之後，特再爲保障公務員生活而呼籲。</p>
<p>目前中下級公務人員本身最大的問題，是物價不斷飛騰，所引起的物質生活的痛苦。因為中級公務員的正式薪俸，僅足以維持其本人之果腹；而低級公務員收入之微，即有維持本身生活而不可得之勢，如何能苛水其忠於職守。於是資質中庸者視官署同逆旅，而唯職外經營是務。這種情形，雖未必為全國普遍的實情，但決不是我們無所依據，故作聳聽的危言。如果這種現象，不加以有效的補救，則在職的公務人員，固將不能安心盡忠於職守，更不足以羅致在野的人才。那麼，我們對於戰時一切政令的成效，實在不能預存樂觀的心理。</p>
<p>因此，我們特再摯誠籲請政府當局：第一，立即以法令改善中下級公務員的物質待遇，或按月以物價指數而另定薪俸與津貼的標準，或依公務員的家庭情形，收支實況而發給食糧與日用品，以維持其個人與家庭最低限度的生活，使能安心奉公，不再有後顧之憂。第二，對各級公務員不分文武，不分男女，規定年功加俸，疾病救子女敎育津貼及養老金制度，並嚴行考功考勤辦法，使公務員有精神上的安慰，而且也可以使他們認眞辦公。我們所理想的人材政治，廉潔政治，和强力政治，只有在上述兩個辦法實現之後，在物質的與精神的保障具備了之後，才能完全實現。</p>
<p>爲了實現上述兩個要求，就目前國家財政狀况說，也許是相當困難的；因爲必然會增加政府一大筆支出，但是當局如有深遠的眼光與偉大的魄力，決不能爲增加政費而束手。因爲公務員生活獲得保障之後，政治效率提高之後，國家所收獲的利益，是無法用數字來估計的。何况對公務員在精神和物質上具備了保障之後，就可以切實地實現人才中義。加以公務員生活有了保障，則貪汚可以澈底消滅，政治可望完全澄淸，所謂廉潔政治也可實現。那麽，目前政府雖多一筆支出，而明日的收獲是無限量的。我們人民寗願多出這一筆錢，以期政府之强化與政治的淸明，却不願在暗中消耗去。我們讀到本月七日東京讀賣新聞所載安岡正篤氏對日本本屆議會所感，有云：「戰時體制下，應盡量激發國民的精神正氣，因此法令務求其簡，而得治人實爲當務之急」。我們對我國目前政治亦有深切的　感。願賢明的當局以最大的決心與毅力，切實保障公務員的生活，而奠定健全政治的基礎。</p>

<p>東京十六日中央社電　日東條首相十六日下午二時半進宮親謁日皇、啟奏訪華經過、並奉答日皇一切垂詢、</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　此次日本東條首相之訪問中國、已使中·日兩國關係更趨緊密、與兩國國民協力合作、以爭取最後勝利之決意、亦必更爲堅强、此間各報除已於昨日晚刋中詳載東條首相訪華消息外，今日復一致於晨刊社論中載文、論其意義、如讀賣報知社論、即以東條首相訪華爲題、說明此次東條首相赴華謁見國府汪主席、並進行懇談、實爲日本歷史上之創舉、並指出日本歷次所發尊重中國自由獨立之聲明、迄今已完全具體化、其大意謂、東條首相此次訪華、其意義實極深長、第一、以首相身份訪問外國、實以此次爲嚆矢、此次東條首相於進行決戰之時、訪問立於同一戰綫之盟邦首都、而與其元首及要員促膝會談、尤屬創舉、首相此行、乃在傳達日本爭取大東亞戰爭最後勝利之決意、並鼓舞盟邦執戈而起之士氣、第二、自近衛聲明發表以來、中日關係已因首相此次訪華而更趨緊密、而得在將來之中日關係上劃一決定階段、按之史乘、關於我國自明治以來所取之對華政策、雖意見紛紛、但其一貫方針、則始終未變、如近衛聲明雖發表於中日事變之中、但其尊重中國之獨立、實即爲我國對華政策傳統精神之表現、其後之中日基本條約、亦復如是、中國參戰後、我國聲明交還在華租界、撤廢治外法權及取消干預行政等、所謂對華政策之轉換、皆爲自戰時所取之臨時措置、在本質上并未轉換我國歷史上之一貫方針、溯自近衛聲明發表以還、我國已屢次聲明尊重中國之自由與獨立、近復於此中國參戰之時、棄條首相以現任首相資格訪問盟邦中國、使中日國交更進入劃期之階段、今後盟邦中國將因而與我國更加緊密提携、其意義實至重且大、又每日新聞社論大意謂、東條首相訪華之第二日、中日兩國交還租界委員、正於中國首都南京簽訂關於日本交還租界實施細目協定與其附屢諒解事項、而定三月三十日將日本在華租界全部正式交還中國之規定、將各租界內之道路橋樑等建設亦完全無代價移讓中國、國府亦確認日本政府及其僑民在租界內所有之不動產及其他權益、故我國在華租界將根據該協定於三月三十日國府還都三週年紀念之日交還中國、按我國自在華開闢租界以來、已有四十餘年、而爲我僑民向大陸發展之立足地、並爲在華日僑之活動地盤、今則行將交還中國、吾人於此實有無限感慨、但思及租界之交還、實爲爭取公正之對華新方策之基礎、故實更不勝慶賀、良以不僅盟邦中國將因此獲得獨立與主權權之完整、中日關係亦將因此而更趨緊密、諒我當地僑民亦必能根據大局之見地、熱烈表示歡迎而慶祝、總之、東條首相之此次訪問中國與中·日簽訂交還租界細目協定、對於緊密中日關係及完成共同戰爭上、實均有莫大貢獻、故今後我國更應克服一切艱難、努力實施政策、以協助國府之强化、國府亦自必諒解我國之眞意、以誠意答復吾人之誠意、眞誠愛護我旅華僑民、同時尊重我國之政策，　各部門實行措施、以促成共同戰爭之完成、</p>

<h3>華北積極增產　物價不致上漲</h3>
<p>北京十六日中央社電　國府參戰後、華北在政治經濟等各方面之地位、愈形重要、以往華北各項施策、多賴友邦之全面協力、而得推進、但今後則端賴以華北本身之努力、以貢獻於國家之復興、並協力完成大東亞戰爭、在此新方針下、華北之一切將如何進展尤其華北之經濟將如何重建、殊堪注視、華北在大東亞圈內、素爲煤鐵棉鹽等物資、產量最豐之地區、負有兵站基地之重要任務、故亦應先謀此等產業之開發及增產、對此其具體方策、現正由當局積極進行、在此新方針之下、對於各中日合辦公司等之組織、將如何</p>
<p>調整改編實爲當　急務、但首應考慮者、即煤鐵鹽等物資、均爲獲得戰爭最後勝利所不可缺之重嬰軍需資源、且與其相輔之交通通信電氣等事業之里要性、亦復相等、因而於調整改編之際、應以不减低此類產業之生產力及阻礙其運營爲原則、故今後其機構之組織、在形勢上雖將有若干改革、而在實質上則恐無若何變更、關於實際調整狀况、則於本月八日有工廠五十九所解除軍曾理、其中佔最重要地位之中興大汶口磁縣山西陽泉等五煤礦、於九日即分別成立合辦之股份有限公司、而各公司之董事長一職俱由華方担任、此舉於今後產業之經營及組織之方式上、實至堪注視、現時華北方面關於物資之</p>
<p>收買配給均以糧食及棉花爲大宗、此在中日事變以前、亦有日商及其他外商人揷足其間，但內裏下部機構、則大部爲中國人經營、如關於糧食則有米莊糧棧等、關於棉花之經營、則有花行等之獨特組織、但就中國產業發達之階段以觀、則其活動之中心、尙未及於商業部門、因考華方資本、僅於該方面佔有極大之重要性、且自事變以來、由於特殊情勢之故、華方在該方面之活動亦趨於衰微、中日雙方對於收買及配給物資之現有機構、均認爲有重新檢討及組織之必要、而因此次政策之實施、對此項需要更覺迫切、在此項事業之性質上言、其全部乃均應由華方經營、目前華北經濟方面之問題雖多、但</p>
<p>物價問題實為其整個基本原因、而糧食問題則爲物價問題之中心、現對此之解決方策、除由　蒙等地輸人雜糧、南方輸入米、及自華中方面轉運麵粉以資補救計、去年並實施增產、本年度則更擴大增產之範圍、於華北全域實　鑿井三十萬眼之計劃、並進行導黃河之水以灌漑天津下游水田之工程，關於樹立增產之施策、現俱在積極進行中、關於物價之高漲、現已無再上漲之可能、惟本年如再豐收、當可望其逐漸回跌、物價昂騰、在戰時爲必然之現象、決無保持常態之可能、但唯求其不過於影響民生、以至整個經濟之運營已足、因之欲使目前之物價極端减低、亦殊困難、故大可抑制其繼續上漲、同時硏求解決各項障礙之方策、以使市面穩定、人心漸安耳、</p>

<h3>桂林的「住」</h3>
<p>— 望六</p>
<p>人多屋少房租飛漲　找住所此找差使難</p>
<p>桂林市府爲平抑房祖，制定非常時期房屋租賃辦法」，即將根據地價稅冊，釐定房屋租價。</p>
<p>人口激增</p>
<p>在後方的許多都市中，桂林是發展最快的一個，尤其各地僑胞，紛紛來桂卜居，人口驟增，市面益呈露非常的景氣。桂林所以道樣繁榮，除了有「甲天下」的山水外，主要因爲交通比較便利，物價比較便宜，但近一年來，物價驚人的跳漲，幾乎已趕上重慶昆明的水準，最使人頭痛的，便是住的問題，初到桂林，找旅館安身便不容易，進一要租步屋安家更難。</p>
<p>房屋難找</p>
<p>有人說，在桂林找房子比謀差使還困難，這的確是事實。城區內大一些的房子，租價竟動輒近萬，鄉郊竹屋，每間也漲到一二百元，頂費押租，條件苛刻，就這樣也非有熟人介紹不易租得。以前賓至如歸的桂林，現在也令人長歎「長安不易居」了！爲什麼？最簡單的解釋，是求過於供。因爲來的人太多，房屋不够分配。其次，物價漲，房租當然也要漲。但細細想來，這理由也非完全正確。第一，桂林一年來添建的新屋，並不算少，市府獎勵人民造房，租地特別便利，地租也極便宜，就一般比例說，建築材料不算特別高，第二，一年來的物價，平均大概漲上三四倍，但房租則幾乎超過十倍。從道裏可以看出桂林的房租問題，也捲入投機居奇的浪潮裏了。明白說，是房主把房產奇貨可居，一般造房子的地產商人，也以發難國財的水準來投資，而二房東三房東一類階級，也像上海香港一樣，成爲應時的產物了。</p>
<p>平抑房租</p>
<p>市府現在要平抑房租，眞是急不容緩，根據地稅來釐定租價，也是天公地道。但除了地稅道一標準外，糧價也可作爲平價的比照。因爲一兩要减除租房者的痛苦，同時當然也要顧到業主的利益，否則視造房爲畏途，扶得東來西又倒，住的問題將更難解決，有人以糧鹽價爲平價標準，這對於一般平價也許有困難，但對於房租則絕對公平適用，因面爲者所費的勞力成本相同，都很少與運輸等問題相關，譬如米價一年來漲一倍多，如房租也這樣漲，業主的利益便不能算少。現在漲到十倍甚至二十倍，如何不駭人聽聞！</p>
<p>門牌與路政</p>
<p>因爲市府注意平抑房租，便聯想到其他兩點住的問題，第一是門牌問題，第二是路政問題。桂林的市區發展太快，過去偏僻的地力，現在已房屋櫛比，像　君路，祝勝里，已儼成住宅區之中心，因此，一個門牌化身幾度，「一號之幾」外，再加上「又幾」，往往相隔數里，還是一個號頭，想探親問路，不僅路人蹙額，連警察也搖頭。最近市府已着手更換門牌，足見已注意到這問題，但僅僅把門牌號數加多數改變，還非根本之計，因爲區域太大，房屋今後還要增加，一定要把大範圍內，劃出小段落，然後按地段排列新門牌，這橡，目前可以眉目一新，將來也不致冉有困難。再如路政問題，最近修橋舖路，僅及城南新市區，其他區域，並未顧到。市府的收入固不多，要在短期內大規模造路，自然有困難，但至少應先有一造路的計劃，尤其幾處發展特別快的住宅區內，應先把榦路支路的路線劃出來，這樣，免得大家爭擠，沒有出路。與其將來拆房讓路，何如今日先把路綫劃定一勞永逸？（三十二年二月四日寄）</p>

<h3>英美蘇對立表面化　蘇波國境綫問題的糾紛</h3>
<p>（沮利希田口特派員四日發（在倫敦的波蘭與南斯拉夫二亡命政權，最近與蘇聯政府之間，關於恢復舊國境的爭執，形成爲英美蘇之間關於處理戰後問題之主義和態度上的矛盾與對立，用重大而且具體的形式表現於倫敦的政治舞台上。</p>
<p>美國報紙公然支持波蘭亡命政府，而蘇聯政府則經塔斯通訊社明白公佈了次述的意見：</p>
<p>（一）波蘭亡命政權的要求，否定了烏克蘭人，白俄羅斯人之團結的權利。波蘭亡命政權所採的强奪政策，十足暴露其帝國主義的企圖。</p>
<p>（二）根據大西洋憲章，波蘭亡命政權以爲其要求是很正當的，但蘇聯以爲保障「各民族有決定其自身運命之權利」的大西洋憲章，一點也不支持波蘭亡命政權的主張。波蘭亡命政權，在開戰之前，否定與德國妥協，但當時的波蘭政府，尤其是柏克外長，對獨裁國取親善政策，試與德國妥協。波蘭政界的指導層，在此次戰爭中，應該覺悟到斯拉夫民族同室操戈之非，而携手共進，但他們不知道這次戰爭的敎訓，要求烏克蘭與白俄羅斯，波蘭人在烏克蘭人與白俄羅斯人之間，種下了仇恨的種子。</p>
<p>波蘭亡命政權反駁</p>
<p>對此，波蘭亡命政權駁稱：「現在捲入大糾紛中的大部分地域，即從歷史上說來亦係屬於波蘭所有，居民也是波蘭人。維爾那，倫貝爾克二主要都市，都生長於波蘭的文化之上，是純粹的波蘭都市。柏克的政策，立於德蘇二軍之間，取均衡政策，因而蘇聯的非雖，毫無根據。」關於波蘭問題的糾紛，在大西洋憲章的解釋上，暴露出意見的對立。蘇聯方面，依據大西洋憲章，擬設定適合自身利益的新的地政學的國境綫，在英政府庇護下的波蘭亡命政權，向蘇聯所提出的要求，視爲違反歷史的事實而加以反對。這蘇聯與波蘭的國境糾紛，英美方面，根據歷史的事實，並在大西洋憲章的基礎之上，想把歐洲的地政學的境界綫，恢復到德國占領以前的狀態。蘇聯方面則主張默洲的改造，即使承認以大西洋憲章爲依歸，但其解釋仍應以各國的立塲出發。因爲蘇聯問題標榜了斯拉夫民族問題，故在大西洋憲章的解釋上，發生了新的問題。</p>
<p>大西洋憲章與蘇聯</p>
<p>蘇聯方面主張波蘭人，捷克人，南斯拉夫人，保加利亞人等全斯拉夫民族，與蘇聯領土內的斯拉夫民族，應一致團結，保持友好關保，而共同生存。蘇聯以爲其要求係根據英美的大西洋憲章，故態度頗爲正當。同時，蘇聯公然要求全斯拉夫民埃的同胞，也完全是新近才開始的。</p>
<p>蘇聯的這種要求，現在表現爲蘇聯與東歐諸國之間的國境問題，英美對之出以何種態度呢？</p>
<p>英國的深切關注</p>
<p>據報紙所載英國政府首腦者的意見稱：</p>
<p>「這問題可由波蘭，蘇聯二當事人中間自行解決，英國政府對此糾紛無置啄的必要。可是像這種糾紛從反軸心國家方面的立塲是頗感遺憾的事。希望蘇聯，波蘭二國的報紙上，勿再互相攻訐，以闢出解決問題的道路。」</p>
<p>完全出以敬而遠之的態度，而道也可代表一般的態度。英國報紙對此不安的糾紛，深爲關注，乃不容諱飾的事實。如「經濟學家」等高級雜誌，也著眼於這糾紛的意義之重大　「蘇聯領土的進出問題與東歐諸國的經濟問題，不能分別解決的。東歐諸國的農業經營加以根本的改革之後，反軸心國家方面共同委員會成立之後，對全歐洲的重要工業加以公共的管理，如此，始能阻止布爾雪維克主義的侵入，而引使英美的社會政策成功。」</p>
<p>同時，關於歐洲經濟的改造，必須獲得蘇聯的諒解。該雜誌的論文，表示了英國新聞雜誌中最現實的態度。（翔：譯自三月六日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>英美的宣傳伎倆　渲染消耗戰竭盡引誘能事</h3>
<p>（阿根廷京城細川特派員四日電）自羅斯福邱吉爾在加薩勃朗加會談以來，英美陣營至少在國內外拼命地作着鼓舞人心的示威，是不能否認的事實。英美方面雖於其聲明中有所謂「戰爭在今年將達最高潮」的話，然而他們却並不說戰爭要在今年結束；不過他們却主張：縱有不少的艱難和困苦隨之而來，戰爭之決定的局面，本年內是一定會得呈現的。無論是羅斯福，是邱吉爾，或是其牠英美方面的代表者，沒有不嚷着：「戰局在今年已有一大轉變」，或「我們已自守勢的作戰而轉向攻勢的作戰了」。由於在歐洲東部戰綫，蘇聯軍的冬季攻勢，顯示着意料之外的進展；在太平洋方面，日本軍從瓜達爾加那爾轉進；反軸心國就把兩件事認爲他們的勝利，以之作誇張宣傳的憑籍，於是英美的宣傳戰，方才稍稍活潑起來。</p>
<p>邱吉爾宣稱，在今年年內要從事歐洲大陸的登陸作戰：羅斯福揚言要轉守爲攻而進擊日本土：英國空軍次長巴爾福於上月二日在下院提出說明，謂目下英美空軍所行對於歐洲大陸的轟炸，「是英美軍在歐洲大陸從事登陸作戰的準備行動」；同日，美陸軍航空司令官阿諾爾德，在紐約馬奇松斯科挨阿加頓的歡迎宋美齡會中，說着這樣大話：「我們必須作轟炸日本本土的準備，多數的美國飛行員，正在派遣到中國去」。</p>
<p>守勢不能致勝</p>
<p>依照他們的宣傳，說是上述這些行動，是加薩勃朗加會談的決定事項。如果這樣，那末英美在今日散佈這樣的宣傳，眞意果在那裏呢？在這樣積極的宣傳裏面，隱藏着什麽計劃呢？觀於英美陣營內所發生着的爭議，英美兩國的同盟，在這次大戰中，已把其潛在力消耗凈盡了嗎？回答是「不」，而且英美國民自己在回答着「不」。</p>
<p>因此他們英美國民異口同聲地一齊喊着：「老是取着守勢，是不能致勝的，非採取攻勢的作戰不可」。在這次大戰中，拿出國家的總力而戰鬭着的國家有二：一爲蘇聯，一爲重慶政權。這兩者已被作爲反軸心國家的靠山，無怪史太林和蔣介石已在把他們的同盟英美的態度，認爲狡猾了。同樣，英美國民自己，也責難兩國政府的沒有勇氣，並且深　　望之餘，反問着英美的軍隊，究竟在做着什麽事，美國艦隊難道祇在好萊塢攝影塲中行動着的嗎？這也並非沒有理由的。英美軍雖在北非開始着攻勢，可是因着德意軸心軍在突尼斯煊赫的作戰奏功，美軍已遭到慘重的敗績；日本軍從瓜達爾加那爾和新幾內亞轉進之前，美海軍也蒙了不能掩飾的重大損害。在這樣不濟事的戰局，還說着：「我們把島嶼一一征服之後，要進擊日本本土」等語，美國人無論那一個，都不會溫和地洗耳恭聽的。羅斯福和邱吉爾切感着不能不有「戲劇的」，動作的演出，於是乃有加薩勃朋加的會談，依照他們兩人的聲明看來，是一決定着兩個遠大而展泛的成果——就是軸心列强的　條件投降和反軸心國的大規模攻勞的開始。</p>
<p>非發動不為功</p>
<p>記者敢說：這個會談雖然不過是串着的一齣戲，可是從其有着許多反軸心首腦的參加看來，不能不認爲在今年年內，必定會有什麽動作發動的，因若沒有什麽動作發動，則不但在英美國內戰綫，有將發生重大反動的可能性，在蘇聯和重慶，也都對於其同盟國的不中用，將倒抽冷氣而加以嫌棄的。因着這樣的情勢，英美兩國乃切感着「非發動什麽不可」的焦躁，於是乎他們就這樣大胆地展開了「大攻勢即將開始」的宣傳。然而這種攻勢，不過基於下列的幾個動機而已！</p>
<p>（一）在高呼着「對軸心國的大攻勢將近開始」之宣傳裏面，所隱藏着的英美之最後目的，是爲要和軸心國始終作戰，必須假藉長期消耗戰而保全其兵力：這是他們對於這次大戰的基本原則，也爲他們遂行戰爭的唯一手段。</p>
<p>（二）在大攻勢宣傳的背後，可以瞭然看出英美的本意，即他們企圖藉此使軸心國的士氣沮喪，且企圖籍此離間日德意三國。</p>
<p>（三）加薩勃朗加會談以來，英美陣營雖然頻頻宣傳着要開始什麽什麽事情，可是英美無論採取怎樣的攻擊手段，總不出於小規模的攻擊。</p>
<p>（四）英美想使蘇聯和重慶始終效着犬馬之勞，乃從事於大攻勢的宣傳，努力拖住蘇聯和重慶於他們的陣綫裏。</p>
<p>（五）他方面，英美不但要軸心國的佔領地域內釀出不穩的空氣，並且要使其他國家難於維持中立。</p>
<p>把戰爭拖下去</p>
<p>總之，加薩勃朗加會談以來，英美所散布着的宣傳目的，確在於想假藉長期消耗戰的、一個節目上。在嚷着「決定這次戰爭勝敗之大攻勢即將開始」的宣傳裏面，是隱藏着「儘力拖長戰爭」之本意的。英國在這次戰爭中，雖然國力相當疲敝，可是最近因為得着美國的各項援助，已經獲有相當恢復，一方面，美國當此止在作着戰時再部緒之際，雖然發現着許多的矛盾和軋轢，可是其國內的地位，的確獲有相當的强固，，在頻頻聽到「戰爭到現在方才開始」的這個當兒，無論從物質上，從十氣上，如其還是作着希望的觀測，那實在是很危險的。把這次大戰，如用公平的眼光來看，則它不是應該看做還要無休無歇地延續嗎！（丁：譯自三月七日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>反英美的大道</h3>
<p>— 趙正平</p>
<p>國立上海大學校長趙正平、三月十四日應中華民族厦英美協會之請、在上海電臺廣播、題爲「反英美的大道」、原文如後、</p>
<p>我今天晚上要購的是「反英美的大道」、</p>
<p>上次我廣播過所謂反英美是反英美的帝國主義、並非是反一般的英美人、爲什麽要反帝國主義、因爲帝國主義就是侵略主義、反帝國主義就是反侵略主義、這種侵略主義、在我們東方文化中、是看不見的、實在我們沐浴過東方文明的人、根本上就毫沒有侵略主義的意念、不　平情而論、英美的帝國主義、尤其英帝國主義、也有些一部分是不知不覺中生長出來、而並非是預定了一種計劃、有意做成的、爲什麽在不知不覺中生長出帝國主義呢、因爲他們旣已有了一種自私自利的國家觀念、於是英國人所到的地方、就形成一個小小的英國、而侵犯他國的生權了、東印度公司滅亡印度、就是一個最明白的例子、在亞美利加大陸澳斯太拉利亞洲樹立了幾個獨立的國家和政府、也是幾個很明白的例子、他們只知道自治、而小顧到當地人民的主權、他們只知這自足、而不顧到當地人民的生計、他們只知道自己行使政權、而不願到聯合常地人民或扶助當地人民行使政權、這就是在不知不覺中形成了一種十足侵略的帝國主義的原因、所以我們一面要購反英美、就須一面要認識自私自利的國家觀念、就是帝國主義的成因、可是我們東方人尤其中觀人、非但沒有自私自利的國家觀念、根本上連近代所謂國家觀念也是很平淡的、我們中國人對於國家的平淡、並非是我中田人的落伍、實在是我們中國人的偉大所在、因爲在東方文明家師孔老夫子的遺敎裏、以及孔門弟子如孟子·荀卿以及當時在孔于先後的老子·墨子等大哲人的遺敎裏、都有一個仁愛等等、以人類爲對象的大目標、這種仁愛、並非是以一國爲範圍、而是以天下爲範圍、就現在的名詞語、就是以仁愛全人類為對象、而毫沒有自私自利的國家意識、據墨子所指示的兼愛論、在歐西宗敎裏或許有這種指示、可是在政治　　裏就不能發見了、所以我們東方人的哲學根據上、本來就含着反帝國主義的因素、所以在孫先生的大亞洲主義裏明白說出英美的文化是霜道的文化、而東方的文化是王道的文化、王道文化當然是不容許取道文化存在的、所以我們東方人只要抱這王這文化、就是以仁義道德國中心的文化發揚起來、光大起來、就是反英美的最有力的武器、</p>
<p>古語說得好、太陽光的下面、看不見爝火、眞正王道光大的時期、當然看不見覇這的影子了、現在篠意軸心細之高聲主張建立歐洲新秩序、我盟邦日本也極力提倡亞洲新秩序、這新秩序的中心思想是什麽、當然是國家間的兼想愛、而不是國家間強凌弱、當然是人民間互相助、而不是人間自私利、其實也只有這個精神、才可以建立新秩序、如在盟邦日本已有了八　一字、就是以正義人道為中心的根本觀念、事實上已在着着推進、像解放緬甸、解放馬來人的事實、都已實現了、今後我新亞洲互相親互相助的日子、就是英美帝國主義完全消滅的時期、這就是反英美的大道、</p>

<h3>教育同仁合作社組織計劃</h3>
<p>— 陳冠宇</p>
<p>三月五日本壇載余君「組織敎師福利會」一文，其意見深爲敎育界人十所同情，但公共團體，辦事不易切實，故同人等認爲非照公司組織，招股創辦「敎育同人合作社」不足收效。</p>
<p>我們預擬的公司組織概要是——股本總額二百萬元，分爲二萬股，每股一百元，官利一分，另有紅利。學校方面，學生人數在一百人以下者，大學至少認十股，中學五股，小　三股，每　增學生二十人，遞加一股，敎職員方面，每人至少一股。全滬大小七百餘校，以平均每校五股計之，可得三十五萬元以上，敎職員人數，約有七八千人，可得七八十萬元以上，二者合計，已超過一百萬元以上，再加自由認附之股，湊成二百萬當不甚難。介紹社員大股多的，推爲理事，享受特別權益，以期格外努力。</p>
<p>公司業務的槪要—（一）請求當局許可，向產增或製造商大批採購生活上必需之物資，以最廉價計口分配各社員。（二）集中代辦書籍文具，紙張油墨，及代印表簿章程曁一切印刷品。（三）發行聯合自編課本。（四）舉辦社員免息借款，及整借零還借款。（五）代爲寄售或貼換舊書，及一切舊傢具衣物。（六）代登招生聯合廣吿，及介紹職業。（七）特約醫師藥煩爲社員廉價或賖欠診病配藥。（八）特設公共食堂宿舍，供社員廉備膳宿。（九）代收學費，代付開支，幷代運用生息。（十）特設公共實騐所，圖書館，體育塲，供社員利用。現已草就章程，設　備處於靜安寺路慕爾鳴路口新市塲內　字中　。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>統制經濟與改善交通</h3>
<p>現在全國商業統制總會暫行條例及戰時物資移動取締暫行條例，業經公佈，積極進行。以人民團體，受政府的監督，在自治的立塲，管理統制物資的收買配給，國內各地物資交換的營運，輸出物資的供給，輸人物資的配給，軍需物資的採辦等事項。將來物資的統制事宜，已有一個健全的機構，完密的計劃。又因於戰時物資移動取締條例的公布，從來的統制辦法，得以和緩，以期在合理的情態之下，各地物資，得能圓活交流。果能上下合作，公正施行，則安定民生，厥功甚偉。</p>
<p>原來物資的流通，除因非常時期必需的限制外，地方區域化的產生，自當竭力興免，這是關於統制的制度和統制的機構方面，來求物資合理的　通。但沒有流通的工具，仍是沒有效果。所以有了健全的機構以後，還狽有流通的工具，其最重要的問題，莫過於運輸了。現在舟車的缺乏固然是不得已的現象，但在可能範圍，務須　運輸方法的便捷，運輸效能的增加，運輸費用的减低，這輸分配的適當，和運輸管理的完善。使制度上工具上，兩得其便，物資交流，自然暢順。</p>
<h3>華中捲煙組合　派貨辦法完全決定</h3>
<p>華中烟草配給組合爲統一辦理捲烟配給起見，辦理全市各大小經銷捲烟行號登記完竣，一切準佛業已就緒，決於短期內實施配給。經審査合格之大同行，已於千五日起繳納，信認金」，限十七日止完全繳淸。「信認金」分甲A級爲五萬元，甲B級爲三萬元，飲交菸業銀行代收，再向該組合領取指定批發商之招牌，專辦各小同行零售商委託派貨事宜。聞各大同行批發商已各自塡具契約，規定辦法必須遵守，違者依法究辦。對於參與捲烟黑市交易，訂有嚴厲制裁辦法。關於小同行零售商，已經分別調査審核完竣，　共五千餘家，已編制分爲等級，完全根據各零售商營業狀况而定，嗣後無輸軍管理頣中烟公司，日商中華烟公司，以及南洋，華成福新，大東等華廠出品，均歸該組合集中配給。至於上海近郊捲烟批發商登記，已在審査中，華中外埠各地之配給，亦已着手進行，所以實施配給之後，捲烟之黑市決不致存在，各零商所發售之價格，決悉照該組合所定之公允價格云。</p>
<h3>賣戶活動　聯鈔驟降　—比上日小去一角四分—</h3>
<p>昨聯銀券已吿反動回下，良因四日來上升五角餘之巨，雖有與軍票自然等價消息，但已有賣戶活動，日客胃轉淡，故回小亦巨，經營者售出已由四元光景，退做小至三元八角八分售出。收進三元八角三分，比上日軋小一角四分，門市售出亦降爲三元九角半。收進僅三元七角半，勢甚　軟。</p>
<p>日軍票則仍少變動尙業互做價五元五角五分三五釐、小錢莊與銀號門市售出五元五角六分，收進四分半。</p>
<p>昨晨錢業公會拆息，仍掛一角八分云。</p>
<h3>榨油原料豐富　食油價格可望下跌</h3>
<p>菜籽爲榨油原料，京滬杭，鐵路沿綫如蘇州，嘉與，平湖等地，每年產量甚豐，故各地油坊林立，去年因各地菜籽歉收，故在食油恐慌十，各地均無原料榨油，以致油價飛漲，但今年蘇州嘉與等地，’菜子因人春以來，天時溫暖，菜苗滋長甚速，故預料各地英子必能豐收、待新貨登塲，各地油坊開工後食油償格必可下跌云</p>

<h3>物價統制</h3>
<p>— 黃宣平</p>
<p>工部局物品統制委員會黃官平氏，頃就物價統制問題，有所列論，茲摘錄其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）經濟理論與金融</p>
<p>査在前年十二月八日以後新局勢之下，經濟及金融問題，有重加研究之必要。茲從經濟及現實環境之觀點上，加以檢討。</p>
<p>第一，目今物資需求旣殷。而供應大多遭受統制與隱　，情形異殊，自非僅憑舊時現論所可輕易解決者。</p>
<p>第二，舊時理論對於統制金　之利書方面，不無輕忽之處，當代之經濟學家須能以金融之膨脹，或節制辦法，以統制物價。</p>
<p>第三，物資有主要與不中要之分，主要物資中國十九足以自給，不主要物品如舶來品者，來源旣斷，無法復置，其售價因之飛漲無度，然主要物價爲人生之必需品，在目前特殊情形之下，正不必以非主要物品之價格作爲主要物品售價之標準。</p>
<p>第四，中國素稱資源富裕之邦，華中之生產足以維持現行新法幣而有餘，故法幣固有眞賞之價値，因此統制物價，亦不可認爲難事。</p>
<p>（二）金融與物價</p>
<p>目下中儲幣在上海區域流通數目，約計二十萬萬元。以前舊法幣在本市流通者，估計當爲三十萬萬元，換言之即新法幣之流通數額，僅及舊法幣三分之二而已。</p>
<p>設放款不予統制，往往有奸商乘機利用其物資，繼續押款，盡量搜購物品，誅求漁利，以致物價無故飛騰，故放款應以重要—業爲限。</p>
<p>（三）統制物價之功能</p>
<p>社曾經濟機構最健全之情形，厥爲物價之穩定，其時旣非高價，亦非低價，在通貨膨漲之時，其現象爲物價高騰，利潤豐厚，商業繁榮，職業有着，銀根鬆弛，利息低微，儼然富有蓬勃之氣象，然而一般薪貨終不能與物價並行，薪工階級之生計日蹙，資本家表面上雖不受影譽，然究其所獲實際等於虛浮。</p>
<p>在通貨緊縮之時其現象為物價低落，利潤微薄。營業清淡，失業衆多，銀根緊縮，利息高厚，各業大有衰落之象。</p>
<p>投資者旣各恃商品爲營業競爭工具，以牟暴利，故物便之統制，非普過施行不可。</p>
<p>物價之構成斷賴物資之供需情形而定，物資流通，物價自然隨之低落，故物品生產在任何社曾經濟機能中佔有最重要之地位，但在此時惟有從速抑平物價，以維持民生，是為上策。</p>
<p>統制物價為政府當局應負之責任，採取更嚴峻之有效措置，以取締投機與囤積，實爲當務之急。</p>
<p>本年三月四日財政部在原則上宣布限制放款條例，採取此種迅速步驟，正當其時，凡屬金融組織，均須令其加入一總公會爲會員，該公會應　嚴密監察，一切活動，須受管轄各種放軟，並應限於重要實業，庶能收效。</p>

<h3>「生」之搏鬭</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>陽光照不到街頭的角隅。</p>
<p>「爲什麽那送飯的老司務還沒來」蜷伏在垃圾箱旁邊的小乞丐那樣想着。深陷下去的眼珠永遠凝着街的那邊。</p>
<p>他想今天至少還有一塲格鬭要表演，他不免回過頭去看看後面那老資格的乞丐，那飢餓綫的同志，但是肚子不容他們互相親愛，只要那大胖子的飯擔一挑來，大家又未免要脫下人性的面具掙扎一下。</p>
<p>大胖子蹣跚地挑來了，瞧！那老乞丐，和別處跟來的乞丐全來了，磨拳擦掌，咬牙切齿……</p>
<p>他也站了起來，那兒來的力量，他似乎感到有一股熱氣在身上沸騰，一個餓虎撲羊勢，搶先一步去開飯擔的蓋。</p>
<p>「沒有！今天一點沒剩—」大胖子叫聲。</p>
<p>照例是一百個「不相信」，飢餓羣團團圍上了。</p>
<p>「當心盆子」！大胖子大叫聲！</p>
<p>其實有什麼奇怪，「你」「我」和「肚子」都是「生死之交」</p>
<p>眞的！飯擔是空的！</p>
<p>「我早就告訴了你們沒有了，現在的「飯」啥價錢？』大胖子一邊收拾，一邊在抱怨！</p>
<p>散了！垂頭喪氣，比以前更餓了的一羣。</p>
<p>小乞丐看着新撕破的施衣　惜。</p>
<p>重新坐下吧！失望嗎？不！是等待，等待大胖子的晚飯，現在是中午，再有六個鐘點呢？</p>
<p>但小乞丐的肚子實在不允許他冉等待六個悠長的鐘點，怎麼辦！他重新站了起來。</p>
<p>街頭的吃食攤多着呢？婦人們的提籃中多着呢？</p>
<p>於是社會中又多了一個小强盜。</p>
<h3>虛心與誠心</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>人家善意的指導，我們應該虛心接受。若是做事，我們應該用誠心來工作。</p>
<p>「虛心接受善意的指導，誠心應付我們的工作。」這是牢不可破的定律，換句話說，也是成功事業必要條件。所以，我們「虛心接受」「誠心工作」，才能得到成功。</p>
<p>「虛心接受」與「誠心工作」的關係，雖然是很淺顯，可是還有許多人把「虛心」和「誠心」弄錯，爲什麼呢？因爲他們把「虛心」用在工作上，把「誠心」用在接受上。</p>
<p>我們應該用客觀的態度—虛心來接受善意的指導，用主觀的力量—誠心來工作，這才是做事應有的態度。</p>
<h3>蘇秦和顏回</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>戰國策中有這麽一段記載：「蘇秦讀書欲睡，引錐自判其股，流血至踝……」，因此父兄們往往將這位蘇　的苦畢精神來敎訓子弟們。更希望能仿效他。</p>
<p>其實呢？從讀書的出發點和目標來看，蘇秦只是一個　子而已，他根本不明　讀書的眞意，他把讀書作爲一件苦事看，因此，他的出發點旣不是出於自願，而目標呢？那更荒乎其唐了，他完全爲了要升官發財，所以才用錐刺了一個洞，血淋淋地塞一些生硬的死學問下去而已。</p>
<p>同樣，在論語中也有一段記載：「一簞食，一瓢飲，在陋卷，人不堪其憂，回也不改其樂，」顏回這種敏而好學的精神，方是眞正求學的態度，他的求學完全是出自內心的自願，雖然住在陋巷，吃不飽，穿不暖，祖仍不能絲毫搖動他求學的信念，怪不得孔夫子說他賢，說他是好子弟。</p>
<p>這歷史上兩個有名的苦學者，但爲了一個出自自動，一個出自被動，便顯然分出後人對於他們高低不同的尊敬，一方面固啟不了求學的眞諦，一方面更吿訴我們凡事只有自心底發出的自願所求到的東西，方是有價値，有意義的東西。否則只是一個標準的獃子而已</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>大家都很緊張，只有臘柏棟不問不聞，頭垂倒了在瞌睡，有時身體向前一竄，幾乎跌到地上去，就連忙將兩脚撑撑牢，身體坐直一些。薛鳳春索性立了起來，將櫈子讓給楊子傑坐，他自己則彳　地走上了炕牀，靜靜地　着，還是眼看了天花板吸香烟。</p>
<p>黃崇菴的水烟格外吸得用力些，咕嚕嚕的聲音固然響得異乎異常，就是吹去烟灰和放入裝烟的筒子時，也不免發出難得聽見的怪聲或高聲，使人知道他是怎樣不悅的心情。</p>
<p>「你不肯寫死契，也不勉强你。」楊子傑又調停着說，「那末這樣吧，就算五十六元吧：那二元錢黃老爺如果不肯認賑，就由我來墊出。」</p>
<p>「多二元錢還是不够。……」根明還是不放　。</p>
<p>「你如果知道黃老爺還要開銷一切費用！」</p>
<p>彼此只是爭論下去，兪篤　提了筆等着，不時將筆尖到硯台上去　　，作着好整以暇的姿勢。　了不算，又提起來有看，然後說：「現在格外冷了，眞要呵凍了。」說了，就放在嘴　吮吮。</p>
<p>突然，一個十來歲的男童急急地衝了進來。他一言不發，直衝到兪　周坐着的地位，將兪篤周面前的抽屜拉了開來，顚起了脚，伸長了頸，兩手在裏面翻者。兪　周先還提着筆，移了一些身體，等他在抽屜裏找，後來耐不住擠軋，他就　性立了起來，在旁邊等着。（十三）</p>
<h3>千斤擔子</h3>
<p>— 天明繪</p>
<h3>樂觀的生活</h3>
<p>— 程達</p>
<p>我遇見過好些人，他們似乎都很「樂觀。」有的說：「過一天算一天。」有的說：「今日有酒今日醉。」我覺得這二句，恰把現社會一般人所抱的生活的態度澈底反映了出來</p>
<p>「過一天算一天」的人心裏早已打定「得過且過」的算盤，只要今天心裏沒有切膚之痛的不舒服，那末依舊是「樂觀。「如果家裏的米不够了，油沒有了，或者在路上受到封鎖的阻礙了，於是心理立刻變化，由「樂觀」而變爲「悲觀；」但是一到各種問題都有辦法的時候。又漸漸的「樂觀」起來了。</p>
<p>至於「今日有酒今日醉」的人「樂觀」得更厲書。他們非但「活得落」而且「想得穿，」抱定「及時行樂」的宗旨。於是乎舞塲，戲院，茶室，酒樓，賭塲，妓院……凡是可以供給「行樂」的地方都去了，大有非此不足以道「樂觀」的氣慨，但「行樂」是要用錢的，於是東搜西刮，本領大些的爬在人頭頂上，本領小些的依財附勢。外面「活不落」的人愈多，他們變得愈「活得落」愈「樂觀」了。</p>
<p>其實，真正的樂觀的生活，倒是着重在精神方面而不重在物質方面的。我們不是人人都有一個或一個以上的「希望」的嗎，假如說：我希望明年我的健康比今年進歩些。或者我們大家希望在最近的將來米價　一些。諸如此類的「希望」都有實現的可能。在「希望」尚未實現之前，我們不必煩惱，不必去羨慕「及時行樂，」也不必把「得過且過」的消極態度。我們如果盡力愛護自已，度一個有規則，不墮落，隨時助人，較嚴肅的生活，那末就有我們的「希望」在前面。所以我以爲一過一天算一天」和「今日有酒今日醉」的生活都是「靠不住的容易變成悲觀的」假的「樂親的生活」；准有「有希望的嚴肅的生活」纔是眞正的樂觀的生活。</p>

<h3>Earnestly Guarantee Civil Servants' Livelihood</h3>
<p>Good governance requires good people to implement it. Because without good people to implement good governance, the laws will not be fully executed, but will simply become empty words on paper. Since joining the war, the National Government has actively established a wartime system, and almost all wartime governance laws are "available in full." But the most important issue is still the issue of governing people, that is, who will implement these laws. There is no doubt that today's government, within a certain limit, is already striving to implement meritocracy. But at the same time, there are two other issues: First, can the existing "governing people," especially the middle and lower-level civil servants, wholeheartedly devote themselves to the implementation of the new policies? Second, if many talented people outside the government cannot be concentrated around the national policy and work together to promote the national policy, then what will be the future of all "governance laws?" We still cannot find satisfactory answers to these two questions. Why? Although there are many reasons, the lack of guarantee for the actual lives of ordinary civil servants is the most important point to consider. Therefore, after calling for improving the lives of civil servants, we are once again calling for guaranteeing the lives of civil servants.</p>
<p>The biggest problem facing middle and lower-level civil servants at present is the suffering of material life caused by the continuous soaring of prices. Because the formal salary of a middle-level civil servant is only enough to feed himself; and the meager income of a low-level civil servant is not even enough to maintain his own life. How can he be expected to be loyal to his duties? As a result, those with mediocre qualifications regard the officialdom as a temporary lodging, and only focus on outside business. Although this situation may not be a universal reality across the country, it is definitely not a groundless alarmist statement. If this phenomenon is not effectively remedied, then the civil servants in office will not be able to wholeheartedly devote themselves to their duties, and it will be even more difficult to attract talented people from outside the government. In that case, we really cannot be optimistic about the effectiveness of all wartime government orders.</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely urge the government authorities once again: First, immediately improve the material treatment of middle and lower-level civil servants through legislation, either by setting standards for salaries and allowances on a monthly basis based on the price index, or by providing food and daily necessities based on the family situation and actual income and expenditure of civil servants, so as to maintain the minimum living standards of individuals and families, so that they can serve the public with peace of mind and no longer have worries about the future. Second, regardless of whether they are civil or military, male or female, stipulate annual salary increases, medical assistance, subsidies for children's education, and pension systems for civil servants at all levels, and strictly implement performance evaluation and attendance methods, so that civil servants have spiritual comfort and can also make them work seriously. Our ideal meritocratic politics, clean politics, and strong politics can only be fully realized after the above two methods are implemented and both material and spiritual guarantees are in place.</p>
<p>To realize the above two requirements, it may be quite difficult given the current state of national finances; because it will inevitably increase a large amount of government expenditure, but if the authorities have far-sighted vision and great courage, they must not be constrained by increasing government expenses. Because after the lives of civil servants are guaranteed and political efficiency is improved, the benefits reaped by the country are impossible to estimate with numbers. Moreover, after providing spiritual and material guarantees for civil servants, meritocracy can be effectively realized. In addition, with the guarantee of civil servants' lives, corruption can be completely eliminated and politics can be completely cleaned up, and the so-called clean politics can be realized. Then, although the government will have one more expenditure now, the harvest tomorrow will be unlimited. We, the people, would rather spend this extra money in the hope of strengthening the government and clarifying politics, rather than having it consumed in the dark. We read about Mr. Yasuoka Masahiro's feelings about the current Japanese parliament as reported by the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun on the 7th of this month, which said: "Under the wartime system, the spirit and integrity of the people should be stimulated as much as possible. Therefore, the laws should be as simple as possible, and it is imperative to have good people to govern." We also have a deep feeling about the current political situation in our country. We hope that the wise authorities will resolutely and persistently guarantee the lives of civil servants and lay the foundation for a sound political system.</p>
<h3>Increased Production Conference Successfully Concluded Yesterday; All Proposals Passed; Proposal to Adjust Food Prices</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Food Department's Increased Production Conference, the second day on the 16th, continued to hold its second general assembly at the Jing City Chamber of Commerce Auditorium at 10 am, presided over by Minister Gu and Vice Minister Zhou. First, all the proposals were submitted for discussion one by one. The attending representatives requested the meeting to study them in detail. The atmosphere at the meeting was always harmonious. All the more than fifty proposals related to increasing food production were unanimously approved after about two hours, with extremely satisfactory results and considerable gains. After the discussion, a temporary motion was unanimously proposed to adjust food prices to support increased food production. It was resolved that the Ministry would handle it at its discretion. Minister Gu then delivered a closing speech, urging all the representatives attending the conference to work hard under the same goal, to carry forward the spirit of the conference, to achieve the goal of increased production, and to complete the mission entrusted to them. (Also reported) All members of the Food Department's Increased Production Conference unanimously resolved to send a respectful telegram to the Chairman. The original telegram is as follows: "To His Excellency the Chairman of the National Government, We, the Food Production Increase Conference, convened on March 15. Under your Excellency's guidance, we pledge to exert our limited abilities and actively study based on what we have learned, so that crops are planted in season and fisheries and animal husbandry flourish, to increase production and enrich storage, to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. We respectfully send this telegram to pay our respects, humbly requesting your consideration. Gu Baoheng, Minister of the Food Department, leads all representatives of the Increased Production Conference in respectfully kowtowing.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Food Department's Increased Production Conference successfully concluded on the 16th. This conference resolved many important cases, all related to the issue of increased food production. Among them, the increased production plan proposed by the Food Department was the most concrete and detailed. The main points of the plan are as follows: After the National Government declared its participation in the war, in order to ensure the needs of the front lines and stabilize the people's livelihood in the rear, it formulated an outline of wartime economic policies as a guideline for governance. It is found that our country's food production is usually insufficient. In order to adapt to wartime supply and demand, it is necessary to greatly increase production. The Ministry deeply feels the importance of its responsibilities and can only strive to mobilize manpower to seek sufficient production of materials, to supply the needs of the front and rear, and to ensure that there is no shortage, in order to complete the war and achieve peace. Therefore, based on the outline, a plan is formulated. Regarding administrative facilities: (A) The policy guidelines include improvement of technology, expansion of the scope of production, promotion of winter crops, prohibition of unnecessary cultivation types, encouragement of wasteland reclamation, construction of farmland water conservancy, organization of rural loans, maintenance of livestock for cultivation, encouragement and assistance of rural side industries, development of fisheries, training of technicians, and irrigation of agricultural technology. (1) Adjusting the organization includes the abolition, adjustment, strengthening, and expansion of the original agricultural affairs agencies in various places, the concentration of human and material resources, and the division of labor and cooperation. Regarding technological improvement: (1) Quick technical connection includes the technical connection between the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and the agricultural affairs agencies in various places. (2) Improvement center, including the selection and breeding of excellent varieties, guidance on cultivation methods, selection of fertilizers, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, improvement of agricultural tools, promotion of food substitutes, cultivation of fish species, universal establishment of hatching fish farming ponds, improvement of livestock breeds, and implementation of breeding livestock epidemic prevention.</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Tokyo; Received in Audience by the Emperor Yesterday Afternoon; Reported on His Visit to China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo returned to Fukuoka on the night of the 15th after visiting the National Government after its participation in the war. He stayed overnight in Osaka and arrived safely in Tokyo at 12:05 pm today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo entered the Imperial Palace at 2:30 pm on the 16th to pay his respects to the Emperor, reported on his visit to China, and answered all inquiries from the Emperor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The visit of Japanese Prime Minister Tojo to China has made the relationship between China and Japan even closer, and the determination of the two countries' people to cooperate and strive for the final victory will surely be even stronger. In addition to the detailed coverage of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China in yesterday's evening editions, all the newspapers here unanimously published editorials in their morning editions today, discussing its significance. For example, the Yomiuri Hochi editorial, entitled "Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to China," stated that Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China to meet with Chairman Wang of the National Government and hold sincere talks was an unprecedented event in Japanese history. It also pointed out that Japan's repeated statements of respecting China's freedom and independence have now been fully materialized. The general idea is that Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is of great significance. First, it is the first time that a prime minister has visited a foreign country in his capacity as prime minister. It is especially unprecedented for Prime Minister Tojo to visit the capital of an allied country standing on the same front at the time of decisive battle and to have heart-to-heart talks with its head of state and senior officials. The Prime Minister's trip was to convey Japan's determination to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War and to encourage the morale of the Allied forces. Second, since the Konoe Statement was issued, the relationship between China and Japan has become closer due to Prime Minister Tojo's visit, and a decisive stage has been marked in the future relationship between China and Japan. According to historical records, although opinions vary on our country's policy toward China since the Meiji era, its consistent policy has never changed. For example, although the Konoe Statement was issued during the Sino-Japanese Incident, its respect for China's independence is a manifestation of the traditional spirit of our country's policy toward China. The subsequent Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was also the same. After China's participation in the war, our country declared the return of concessions in China, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the cancellation of interference in administration. The so-called conversion of policy toward China is a temporary measure taken during the war and has not fundamentally changed our country's consistent policy in history. Since the Konoe Statement was issued, our country has repeatedly stated its respect for China's freedom and independence. Recently, at the time of China's participation in the war, Prime Minister Tojo visited Allied China in his capacity as the current prime minister, making the Sino-Japanese relationship enter a new era. In the future, Allied China will be able to cooperate more closely with our country, and its significance is extremely important and great. Also, the Mainichi Shimbun editorial stated that on the second day of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China, the Sino-Japanese Concession Return Committee formally signed the agreement on the implementation details of Japan's return of the concession and the attached understanding matters in Nanjing, the capital of China, and stipulated that all Japanese concessions in China would be formally returned to China on March 30. The construction of roads, bridges, etc. in each concession will also be completely transferred to China without compensation. The National Government also confirmed all the real estate and other rights and interests of the Japanese government and its residents in the concession. Therefore, our country's concessions in China will be returned to China on March 30, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, according to the agreement. It has been more than forty years since our country opened concessions in China, and it has been a foothold for our overseas Chinese to develop to the mainland and a base for the activities of Japanese residents in China. Now, it will be returned to China. We have unlimited feelings about this. However, thinking that the return of the concession is the basis for striving for a fair new policy toward China, we are even more delighted. Not only will Allied China gain independence and integrity of sovereign rights, but the relationship between China and Japan will also become closer as a result. It is believed that our local overseas Chinese will also warmly welcome and celebrate based on their overall view. In short, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China and the signing of the detailed agreement on the return of the concession by China and Japan have made great contributions to tightening Sino-Japanese relations and completing the common war. Therefore, our country should overcome all difficulties and strive to implement policies to assist in the strengthening of the National Government. The National Government will also surely understand our country's true intentions and respond to our sincerity with sincerity, sincerely love our overseas Chinese in China, and at the same time respect our country's policies. Various departments will implement measures to promote the completion of the common war.</p>
<h3>Progress of Japan's Policy Toward China; Broadcasting Speech by Minister of Information, Kotomi, Last Night</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Information of the Japanese Embassy, Kotomi, gave a broadcasting speech on the radio station on the evening of the 16th, entitled "The Progress of Japan's Policy Toward China." His main point was that "Prime Minister Tojo flew to Nanjing on the 13th to express his gratitude to Chairman Wang of the National Government for visiting Japan last December and to express his respect for China's participation in the war, met with Chairman Wang, held sincere talks, and sincerely exchanged opinions with the National Government authorities. The relationship between China and Japan has been strengthened. China and Japan originally had a close relationship. The development of Japan is also the development of China, and the prosperity of China is also the prosperity of Japan. Therefore, Japan takes cooperation with China in restoring sovereignty as the basic policy toward China. When the National Government returned to Nanjing, China and Japan signed the basic treaty. Japan, in accordance with its established promises, abolished extraterritorial rights in China and returned the concessions. On January 9 of this year, the Sino-Japanese Agreement was signed, recognizing China's recovery of the Beijing Legation District and the Shanghai and Xiamen Public Concessions. Since March 4, the Sino-Japanese Committee has actively carried out negotiations and signed the agreement on the return of the special concessions in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Chongqing on the 14th, scheduling the implementation ceremony for March 30, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. At the same time, the members of the committee on the abolition of extraterritorial rights are currently conducting negotiations with the Chinese side and hope that they can also be realized soon. At this point, the relationship between China and Japan has become increasingly close."</p>
<h3>Ambassador Aikawa Pays Respects at the Mausoleum in Nanjing</h3>

<h3>North China Actively Increases Production; Prices Will Not Rise</h3>
<p>Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government joined the war, the position of North China in various aspects such as politics and economy has become increasingly important. In the past, various policies in North China relied heavily on the comprehensive cooperation of friendly countries to advance, but in the future, it will depend on the efforts of North China itself to contribute to the restoration of the country and cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. Under this new policy, how will everything in North China progress, especially how will the economy of North China be rebuilt, which is particularly noteworthy. North China is the region with the most abundant production of materials such as coal, iron, cotton, and salt in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and bears the important task of a military base. Therefore, the development and increased production of these industries should be planned first. The specific measures for this are currently being actively carried out by the authorities. Under this new policy, how will the organization of various Sino-Japanese joint ventures be adjusted and reorganized? This is a pressing matter, but the first thing to consider is that materials such as coal, iron, and salt are important military resources indispensable for winning the final victory of the war, and the importance of the transportation, communication, and electricity industries that complement them is also equal. Therefore, in the adjustment and reorganization, the principle should be not to reduce the productivity of such industries and hinder their operation. Therefore, although the organization of the institutions will have some reforms in form in the future, there will be no changes in substance. Regarding the actual adjustment situation, on the 8th of this month, the military management of 59 factories was lifted, and the five most important coal mines, including Zhongxing, Dakou, Cixian, Shanxi Yangquan, etc., established joint-venture limited liability companies on the 9th, and the chairman of each company was assumed by the Chinese side. This move is worth noting in terms of the operation and organization of the industry in the future. Currently, the materials purchased and allocated in North China are mainly food and cotton. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, there were also Japanese and other foreign merchants involved, but the internal lower-level institutions were mostly operated by Chinese people. For example, for food, there were rice shops and grain shops, etc. For the operation of cotton, there were unique organizations such as flower shops. However, from the perspective of the stage of development of Chinese industry, its center of activity has not yet reached the commercial sector, because Chinese capital occupies a very important position in this area, and since the incident, due to special circumstances, the activities of the Chinese side in this area have also tended to decline. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides believe that the existing institutions for purchasing and distributing materials need to be re-examined and organized, and the implementation of this policy makes this need more urgent. In terms of the nature of this undertaking, all of it should be operated by the Chinese side. Although there are many problems in the economic aspect of North China at present, the price problem is the basic reason for the whole, and the food problem is the center of the price problem. At present, in addition to the supplementary measures of importing miscellaneous grains from Inner Mongolia, importing rice from the south, and transferring flour from Central China, increased production was also implemented last year, and the scope of increased production will be further expanded this year, with a plan to drill 300,000 wells throughout North China and carry out the project of diverting the water of the Yellow River to irrigate the downstream farmland in Tianjin. Regarding the establishment of measures to increase production, they are currently being actively carried out. Regarding the rise in prices, there is no possibility of a further rise at present, but if there is another bumper harvest this year, it can be expected to gradually fall back. Rising prices are an inevitable phenomenon in wartime, and it is impossible to maintain a normal state. But it is only sought not to affect people's livelihood too much, so that the operation of the entire economy is sufficient. Therefore, it is difficult to drastically reduce the current prices, so it is possible to suppress its continued rise and research solutions to various obstacles, so as to stabilize the market and gradually appease the people.</p>

<h3>"Living" in Guilin</h3>
<p>— Wang Liu</p>
<p>More People Than Houses, Soaring Rents: Finding a Home is Harder Than Finding a Job</p>
<p>The Guilin Municipal Government, in order to stabilize rents, has formulated "Measures for Housing Leases During Extraordinary Times," which will determine housing rents based on land tax records.</p>
<p>Rapid Population Increase</p>
<p>Among the many cities in the rear areas, Guilin is one of the fastest-growing, especially with overseas Chinese from various places coming to Guilin to settle down, leading to a sharp increase in population and an exceptionally prosperous market. The reason for Guilin's prosperity is not only its scenery, which is "the best in the world," but also its relatively convenient transportation and cheaper prices. However, in the past year, prices have soared, almost reaching the level of Chongqing and Kunming. The most troublesome problem is housing. It is not easy to find a hotel to stay in when you first arrive in Guilin, and it is even more difficult to rent a house to settle down.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Finding Housing</p>
<p>Some say that finding a house in Guilin is more difficult than finding a job, which is indeed the case. In the urban area, the rent for a slightly larger house can easily be close to ten thousand yuan. Even a rural bamboo house costs one or two hundred yuan per room. The transfer fees and deposits are harsh, and even with these conditions, it is not easy to rent a house without an introduction from someone you know. Guilin, which used to be welcoming to guests, now makes people sigh, "It is not easy to live in Chang'an!" Why? The simplest explanation is that demand exceeds supply because there are too many people and not enough houses to allocate. Secondly, as prices rise, so too must rents. But on closer inspection, this reason is not entirely correct. First, the number of new houses built in Guilin in the past year is not small. The municipal government encourages people to build houses, making it particularly convenient to rent land, and the land rent is also very cheap. Generally speaking, building materials are not particularly expensive. Second, the average price increase in the past year is probably three to four times, but rents have almost increased tenfold. From this, we can see that the rental problem in Guilin has also been caught up in a wave of speculation and hoarding. To put it bluntly, landlords are making their properties scarce and valuable, and real estate merchants building houses are investing at the level of profiting from the national crisis. Classes such as second and third landlords have also become products of the times, like in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Rents</p>
<p>It is now urgent for the municipal government to stabilize rents, and it is only right to determine rents based on land taxes. In addition to the land tax standard, grain prices can also be used as a reference for fair prices. Because while reducing the suffering of renters, the interests of homeowners must also be taken into account. Otherwise, building houses will be seen as a daunting task, and the problem of housing will become even more difficult to solve. Some suggest using grain and salt prices as a fair price standard, which may be difficult for general fair prices, but it is absolutely fair and applicable to rents. Because the labor costs for both are the same, and they are rarely related to transportation issues. For example, if the price of rice has increased by more than double in the past year, and rents have increased in the same way, the owners' profits cannot be considered small. How can it not be shocking to hear that they have increased tenfold or even twentyfold!</p>
<p>House Numbers and Road Administration</p>
<p>Because the municipal government is paying attention to stabilizing rents, it is associated with two other housing problems: first, the house number issue, and second, the road administration issue. The urban area of Guilin has developed too quickly. Areas that were once remote are now densely packed with houses. For example, Junjun Road and Zhesheng Li have become the center of residential areas. As a result, one house number is reincarnated several times. In addition to "number X of number," there is also "another number X." Often, even though they are several miles apart, they still have the same number. When trying to visit relatives or ask for directions, not only do passers-by frown, but even the police shake their heads. Recently, the municipal government has started to replace house numbers, which shows that they have noticed this problem. However, simply increasing or changing the house numbers is not a fundamental solution. Because the area is too large, and the number of houses will continue to increase in the future, it is necessary to divide the large area into smaller sections and then arrange new house numbers according to the section. This way, things can look brand new now, and there will be no difficulties in the future. As for road administration, the recent bridge and road repairs have only reached the new urban area south of the city, and other areas have not been taken care of. The municipal government's income is limited, and it is naturally difficult to build roads on a large scale in the short term, but at least there should be a road construction plan first. Especially in several residential areas that are developing particularly fast, the routes of the main and branch roads should be marked out first. This way, everyone will avoid crowding and having no way out. Rather than demolishing houses to make way for roads in the future, why not mark out the road lines once and for all today?

<h3>Soviet High Command Admits: Kharkov Lost Again; German Forces Continue to Advance Southeast</h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, Haidong News Agency, 16th: Today's German war report states that German forces have launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkov and Belgorod areas and northwest of Kursk, making further progress yesterday. 56 more Soviet aircraft were shot down on the Eastern Front. Enemy forces southeast of Kharkov have been encircled. The elite Soviet forces counterattacking west of Belgorod retreated without success. Enemy forces on the Lake Ilmen front received reinforcements yesterday, attempting to break through German lines but were heavily bombarded and retreated after fierce hand-to-hand combat with heavy casualties. Yesterday, in aerial engagements between German and Soviet aircraft, only four German planes failed to return to base, while the enemy lost 56 planes, including four shot down by Slovak fighter-bombers.</p>
<p>Moscow, Allied News Agency, 16th: The Soviet High Command last night admitted that Kharkov had been lost again after being occupied by Soviet forces for a week. A communiqué issued at midnight by the Soviet Information Bureau stated, "Our forces have withdrawn from the city of Kharkov on orders from the High Command after fierce fighting."</p>
<p>Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 16th: The most important aspect of Sunday's fighting on the Eastern Front was the continued eastward and southeastward advance of German forces from Kharkov. A large-scale Soviet offensive at Staraya Russa has been repelled. The number of captured items in Kharkov has not yet been announced. Kharkov is an important transportation center, but the German goal is not to reoccupy the retreated areas, but to inflict significant blows on the enemy. The intensity of the winter fighting has not diminished, as evidenced by the Soviet offensives at Staraya Russa and Belgorod. The German operation to shorten the lines at Vyazma is still underway. The weather in the central and southern sectors is very good, suitable for large-scale combat.</p>
<p>Personnel Change on the Kharkov Front: Soviet Commander Replaced</p>
<p>A border area of the Soviet Union, Havas Agency, 16th: According to semi-official Soviet sources, the German counteroffensive at Kharkov concentrated 100,000 troops and 1,000 tanks, with fresh reinforcements arriving continuously at the front. The German offensive forms a semicircle from Zmiiv to Volchansk to Barvenkovo, advancing rapidly toward Belgorod. According to unconfirmed reports, the renowned Soviet general Yugov has replaced General Golikov in command of the Kharkov front. In addition, the Red Army is still attacking in the Vyazma area, encountering strong German resistance, particularly south of Bely. According to announcements from Radio Moscow, although the Red Army has broken through German lines in three places there, the Germans have another line of defense. South of Vyazma, after occupying the city of Kholm, the Red Army has reached the upper reaches of the Dnieper River in the northern sector of the Eastern Front. General Timoshenko's troops are also redeploying near Staraya Russa, with major developments expected in the coming days.</p>
<p>Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 16th: The German counteroffensive on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has expanded to the areas west and northwest of Kursk. The center of the fighting is now near Belgorod. German units that had been fighting in Siversk and Rogov have also joined the German offensive. Although the Soviet forces are retreating, they are doing so in an orderly manner. However, the resistance of the Red Army near Belgorod is very strong, as the Soviet command has redeployed reinforcements from elsewhere to join the battle. However, the German offensive is still very successful. Even the 1st Guards Tank Brigade of the Soviet forces, which came to reinforce, could not stop the German advance. After losing 44 tanks, the Soviet forces were forced to retreat. Now the German vanguard has reached the city of Belgorod, and the enemy is preparing to resist in the southwest of the city. At 6:50 PM on Sunday, after completely occupying Kharkov, German forces continued to advance 35 kilometers beyond Kharkov. Another part of the German forces advanced northeast from Kharkov, threatening Volchansk, which is 50 kilometers from Kharkov. The fighting in the Orel area over the weekend was relatively quiet. Soviet forces began to attack west of Sukhinichi with a large army, but were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Major Battle in the Kursk Area Now Underway</p>
<p>Berlin, Allied News Agency, 16th: Official circles here stated last night that although Soviet forces attacked south of Lake Ilmen and west of Belgorod on Sunday, German forces in the southern Soviet territory have consolidated their control over the important transportation lines between Belgorod and the Donets River southeast of Kharkov, further influencing the evolution of the entire Eastern Front. Not giving the Soviet forces a respite, German forces departed from Kharkov on Sunday and advanced northeastward about 30 miles to Volchansk. According to German sources, General Hoth's German forces completely occupied Kharkov at 6:50 PM on March 14. At the same time, major battles in the Belgorod and Kursk areas are underway. German forces have assembled elite troops and are strengthening their pressure on the Soviet forces. Soviet forces launched counterattacks in several locations in an attempt to contain the German forces, but were heavily damaged and retreated. Although the Soviet forces resisted stubbornly, they were no match for the heavy blows of the German forces and retreated. In order to strengthen their resistance west of Belgorod, Soviet forces dispatched the 1st Tank Guard Brigade to the area, resulting in fierce fighting. In this battle, the "Greater Germany" Infantry Regiment of the German side destroyed 44 Soviet tanks. Recent war news reports that two German routes are now approaching Belgorod from the south and west, while Soviet forces are attacking in the Sukhinichi area, about 90 miles northwest of Orel, apparently attempting to break through the German flank. At the same time, they are again attacking in the Staraya Russa area south of Lake Ilmen, attempting to invade the German defense line but were unsuccessful. In the central Moscow area, German forces continued their planned operation to shorten their lines. The German mountain troops in the north launched several lightning strikes against strong Soviet strongholds, destroying several Soviet positions in the Kandalaksha, Lizha, and Murmansk areas. The German Air Force assisted in the battle throughout the previous two days, bombing Soviet positions, transportation lines, and bases. It is reported that the Soviet Air Force lost 64 aircraft on Sunday.</p>

<h3>British, American and Soviet Conflicts Surface; Dispute Over the Soviet-Polish Border Line</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Taguchi from Zurich, 4th) (The dispute between the Polish and Yugoslavian governments-in-exile in London and the Soviet government regarding the restoration of the old borders has recently taken the form of a major and concrete manifestation of the contradictions and oppositions between the British, American, and Soviet governments regarding the principles and attitudes in dealing with postwar issues on the London political stage.</p>
<p>American newspapers openly support the Polish government-in-exile, while the Soviet government, through the TASS news agency, has clearly announced the following views:</p>
<p>(1) The demands of the Polish government-in-exile deny the rights of the Ukrainians and Belarusians to unity. The Polish government-in-exile's policy of forceful seizure fully exposes its imperialist intentions.</p>
<p>(2) According to the Atlantic Charter, the Polish government-in-exile believes that its demands are very legitimate, but the Soviet Union believes that the Atlantic Charter, which guarantees "the right of all nations to determine their own destiny," does not support the Polish government-in-exile's claims at all. Before the outbreak of the war, the Polish government-in-exile refused to compromise with Germany, but the Polish government at that time, especially Foreign Minister Beck, adopted a friendly policy towards the dictatorships and tried to compromise with Germany. The leadership of the Polish political circles should realize the wrongdoing of Slavic infighting in this war and join hands, but they do not know the lessons of this war and demand Ukraine and Belarus. The Poles have sown seeds of hatred among Ukrainians and Belarusians.</p>
<p>Rebuttal from the Polish Government-in-Exile</p>
<p>In response, the Polish government-in-exile retorted: "The majority of the areas now involved in the major dispute historically belong to Poland, and the residents are also Polish. The two major cities of Vilnius and Lviv both grew up on Polish culture and are purely Polish cities. Beck's policy was based on a balanced policy between the German and Soviet armies, so the Soviet Union's denunciation is unfounded." The dispute over the Polish issue reveals a conflict of opinion on the interpretation of the Atlantic Charter. The Soviet side, based on the Atlantic Charter, intends to set new geopolitical borders suitable for its own interests. The Polish government-in-exile, under the protection of the British government, opposes the demands made to the Soviet Union as a violation of historical facts. In this Soviet-Polish border dispute, the British and American sides, based on historical facts and on the basis of the Atlantic Charter, want to restore the geopolitical boundaries of Europe to the state before the German occupation. The Soviet side advocates the reconstruction of Europe, and even if it acknowledges the Atlantic Charter as its basis, its interpretation should still be based on the standpoint of each country. Because the Soviet issue proclaims the Slavic national issue, a new problem has arisen in the interpretation of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Charter and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The Soviet side argues that all Slavic nations, such as Poles, Czechs, Yugoslavs, and Bulgarians, and the Slavic nations within the Soviet territory should unite and maintain friendly relations and live together. The Soviet Union believes that its demands are based on the British and American Atlantic Charter, so its attitude is quite justified. At the same time, the Soviet Union's open demand for solidarity among all Slavic nations is also something that has only recently begun.</p>
<p>This demand of the Soviet Union is now manifested in the border issue between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. What attitude will the British and American sides take towards this?</p>
<p>Britain's Deep Concern</p>
<p>According to the opinions of British government leaders as reported in newspapers:</p>
<p>"This issue can be resolved by the two parties involved, Poland and the Soviet Union, and the British government does not need to comment on this dispute. However, such a dispute is quite regrettable from the standpoint of the anti-Axis countries. It is hoped that the newspapers of the Soviet Union and Poland will no longer attack each other, so as to open up a path to resolving the problem."</p>
<p>It completely takes a respectful and distant attitude, which can also represent the general attitude. The fact that British newspapers are deeply concerned about this unsettling dispute is undeniable. Even high-level magazines such as "The Economist" focus on the significance of this dispute. "The issue of the entry and exit of Soviet territory and the economic issues of Eastern European countries cannot be solved separately. After fundamental reforms are made to the agricultural management of Eastern European countries, after the establishment of a joint committee on the anti-Axis countries, and after the important industries of the whole of Europe are publicly managed, it will be possible to prevent the invasion of Bolshevism and lead to the success of British and American social policies."</p>
<p>At the same time, the reconstruction of the European economy must obtain the understanding of the Soviet Union. The magazine's essay represents the most realistic attitude among British news magazines. (翔: Translated from the March 6 issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Propaganda Tactics of the British and Americans: Exaggerating a War of Attrition to the Utmost</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Correspondent Hosokawa, 4th) It is undeniable that since the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting in Casablanca, the Anglo-American camp has been frantically engaging in morale-boosting demonstrations, both domestically and internationally. While the Anglo-American statements have mentioned that "the war will reach its climax this year," they do not say that the war will end this year. Instead, they assert that despite the many hardships and difficulties that may arise, the decisive phase of the war will definitely be presented within this year. Whether it is Roosevelt, Churchill, or other Anglo-American representatives, they are all proclaiming: "The war situation has undergone a major change this year," or "We have shifted from defensive to offensive operations." Due to the unexpectedly rapid progress of the Soviet army's winter offensive on the Eastern European front, and the Japanese army's retreat from Guadalcanal in the Pacific, the anti-Axis powers have taken these two events as their victories and used them as a basis for exaggerated propaganda. Only then has the Anglo-American propaganda war become somewhat lively.</p>
<p>Churchill has declared that he will undertake a landing operation on the European continent within this year. Roosevelt has vowed to shift from defense to offense and attack the Japanese mainland. British Air Force Under-Secretary Balfour stated in the House of Commons on the 2nd of last month that the current bombing of the European continent by the Anglo-American air forces is "a preparatory action for the Anglo-American forces to engage in landing operations on the European continent." On the same day, US Army Air Force Commanding General Arnold, at a welcome meeting for Soong Mei-ling in New York's Madison Square Garden, made such boastful remarks as: "We must prepare to bomb the Japanese mainland, and a majority of American pilots are being dispatched to China."</p>
<p>Defensive Posture Cannot Lead to Victory</p>
<p>According to their propaganda, the above-mentioned actions are decisions made at the Casablanca meeting. If so, then what is the true intention behind the Anglo-Americans spreading such propaganda today? What plan is hidden within such aggressive propaganda? Considering the disputes occurring within the Anglo-American camp, has the Anglo-American alliance exhausted its potential power in this war? The answer is "no," and the Anglo-American people themselves are answering "no."</p>
<p>Therefore, the Anglo-American people are shouting in unison: "Adopting a defensive posture all the time cannot lead to victory. We must adopt offensive operations." In this war, there are two countries fighting with their total national strength: one is the Soviet Union, and the other is the Chongqing regime. These two have been regarded as the backbone of the anti-Axis powers, so it is no wonder that Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek view the attitude of their allies, the British and Americans, as cunning. Similarly, the Anglo-American people themselves are criticizing their governments for lacking courage and, filled with deep disappointment, are asking what the Anglo-American troops are actually doing. Is the American fleet only active in Hollywood film studios? This is not without reason. Although the Anglo-American forces began an offensive in North Africa, the Axis forces of Germany and Italy achieved resounding success in their operations in Tunisia, and the American forces suffered a heavy defeat. Before the Japanese army retreated from Guadalcanal and New Guinea, the US Navy also suffered significant losses that could not be concealed. In such an unsatisfactory war situation, to say things like "We will conquer the islands one by one, and then attack the Japanese mainland" would not be something any American would listen to patiently. Roosevelt and Churchill keenly felt the need for a "dramatic" and active performance, and thus there was the Casablanca meeting. According to their statements, it was to decide on two far-reaching and expansive results: the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers and the beginning of a large-scale offensive by the anti-Axis powers.</p>
<p>No Action, No Success</p>
<p>This reporter dares to say that although this meeting was just a staged performance, considering that it involved the participation of many anti-Axis leaders, it must be assumed that something will definitely be launched this year. Because if no action is launched, not only is there a possibility of a major backlash on the Anglo-American domestic front, but the Soviet Union and Chongqing will also be disappointed and resentful towards their useless allies. Because of this situation, the Anglo-American countries keenly feel the anxiety of "having to launch something," and thus they boldly launched the propaganda that "a major offensive is about to begin." However, this offensive is based only on the following motivations!</p>
<p>(1) The ultimate goal of the British and Americans, hidden within the propaganda of "the great offensive against the Axis powers is about to begin," is to preserve their military strength by resorting to a long-term war of attrition in order to fight the Axis powers to the end. This is their fundamental principle for this war and the only means for them to carry out the war.</p>
<p>(2) Behind the propaganda of a major offensive, the true intention of the British and Americans can be clearly seen, that is, they are attempting to demoralize the Axis powers and to alienate the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>(3) Since the Casablanca meeting, the Anglo-American camp has frequently propagated that they will begin this or that, but no matter what kind of offensive measures the British and Americans take, they will never go beyond small-scale attacks.</p>
<p>(4) The British and Americans want to keep the Soviet Union and Chongqing working like dogs and horses, so they engage in the propaganda of a major offensive and strive to keep the Soviet Union and Chongqing in their camp.</p>
<p>(5) On the other hand, the British and Americans not only want to create an unstable atmosphere within the occupied territories of the Axis powers, but also want to make it difficult for other countries to maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>Dragging the War On</p>
<p>In short, the purpose of the propaganda spread by the British and Americans since the Casablanca meeting is indeed to resort to a program of long-term attrition warfare. Hidden within the propaganda of "the great offensive that will decide the victory or defeat of this war is about to begin" is the true intention of "trying to prolong the war as much as possible." Although Britain's national strength has been considerably depleted in this war, it has recently achieved considerable recovery due to various forms of assistance from the United States. On the other hand, while the United States is currently in the process of wartime re-mobilization and is experiencing many contradictions and frictions, its domestic position has indeed gained considerable strength. At this moment, when we frequently hear "the war has only just begun," it would be very dangerous to continue to make hopeful observations, whether in terms of material resources or morale. If we look at this war with a fair eye, shouldn't it be seen as continuing endlessly? (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, March 7)</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Business Control Association Begins Handling Material Movement Permits Yesterday; Application Form Requires Certification from Trade Association in Triplicate</h3>
<p>The National Business Control Association, which has been organized and established in accordance with the provisional regulations promulgated by the National Government, began handling matters relating to applications for material movement permits yesterday (the 16th). All articles of association will be publicly announced once they are submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. It is understood that the association held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Bank of Communications at 9 Jing'an Temple Road yesterday (the 16th) at 4:00 PM to discuss matters such as the association's headquarters, the organization of various departments, the allocation of major responsibilities for each department, and the steps for future association work.</p>
<p>Relevant Parties Gave Guidance Yesterday</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Business Control Association, in order to comply with Articles 6 and 8 of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement promulgated by the National Government, a material movement permit office was established. It began handling applications for material movement permits at the Hamilton Building (the former site of the Japanese Embassy Concession Office) at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road in Shanghai yesterday (the 16th). However, because the association was newly established and personnel assignments had not yet been finalized, the Ministry of Industry specially dispatched a number of officials to Shanghai to assist. The material movement permit application business handled by the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office was also transferred to the association's office yesterday. It is understood that at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 16th), Zhang Jun, Director of the Special Commodity Transportation and Sales Administration of the Ministry of Industry, Abe, a technician from the Shanghai Japanese Embassy, and Mr. Kishigami, an investigator, went to assist and guide. Until noon, Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city went to inquire about the procedures for applying for material movement permits and to obtain application forms for permits, which were extremely crowded. The application form for the material import and export permit is divided into three copies. After the applicant fills out the form, one copy must be investigated and reviewed, one copy is approved and stamped by the office, and a certificate is issued for material movement, and one copy is a stub. All applicants for material movement must be certified by the industry trade association as a member of the industry before they can be approved to apply. It is reported that Yuan, the Vice Minister of Industry, and Huang Jiangquan, the Supervisor of the association, specially went to the office for inspection at 10:00 AM that morning.</p>
<p>Main Tasks</p>
<p>The National Business Control Association held its establishment ceremony the day before yesterday and began operating in the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road yesterday. Although the internal administrative structure has not yet been fully formed, in order to urgently implement the government's newly promulgated laws and regulations on special material control, it is proceeding with the handling of various tasks. The main scope of work, as learned by this newspaper's reporter, is as follows: (1) Purchase and distribution of materials in the Central China region; (2) Matters related to the signing and issuance of material movement permits; (3) Management of barter trade between Central China and North and South China; (4) Liaison with various industries and business groups; (5) Purchase of military materials and natural products required for military production.</p>
<p>Unified Control</p>
<p>Since the Control Association has begun work since yesterday, the establishment of its various departments and sections will surely be completed as soon as possible. The offices of each department of the association are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary-General of the General Office. Each department handles specific materials separately, and each department will be divided into several business groups to individually manage certain materials. These business groups will then contact the various Chinese and Japanese trade associations and, through the mediation of the associations, will come into contact with the various stores. In this case, the Control Association will designate stores to directly trade with producers to purchase materials. If stores purchase materials within the same region of Central China, then these stores will form a group to unify the purchase and distribution of materials. The association will establish branches in major cities in Central China to handle local material control matters.</p>
<p>System Management</p>
<p>The system for the unified management of materials is that the local trade associations of various industries will advance to the joint associations of various industries and finally concentrate in the National Business Control Association. In order to strengthen material control, the local authorities in this city previously ordered trade associations to register. Currently, more than 300 units have been registered. However, among the associations, those with similar characteristics will be gradually merged in the future to unify the control work. There are 28 textile companies, 25 food companies, 17 grocery companies, 16 metal companies, 13 manufacturing and search machinery companies, 9 wine, soy sauce, and fuel companies, 7 pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and paint dye companies, 6 clothing, food and beverage, leather, and oil companies, 5 grain and stationery companies, 4 tobacco, transportation, and finance companies, 3 furniture companies, and 17 other companies.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Control Department Adopts a Cooperative Attitude: Director Inagaki Expresses His Thoughts</h3>
<p>Regarding the situation of the Public Concession's Material Control Department after the establishment of the National Business Control Association, a reporter from the Shen News Agency specially interviewed Mr. Inagaki, Director of the Public Concession's Material Control Department, yesterday (the 16th) morning. He was received and allowed to express his thoughts on the association as follows: The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Department will do its best to assist in spirit and cooperate closely with the National Business Control Association. Regarding the specific policy for the future, the authorities of China and Japan have not yet announced the detailed rules for this material control, nor has any formal order been announced, so it is still impossible to predict. My opinion on the National Business Control Association is just like a paragraph in the speech given by Minister Tajiri at the association's establishment meeting yesterday (the 15th): "The issue of material control must be based on the starting point of its own nature. If you only want to make the material control smooth with laws and institutions, this is actually more difficult. Therefore, everyone must personally practice it, make reasonable activities, and always consider the control hub and assist it. If you rely solely on institutions, there will be no achievement." I think that the speech given by Minister Tajiri at the establishment meeting yesterday (the 15th) was a very famous and excellent talk. Yesterday (the 15th), I was also invited to participate in the establishment meeting of the National Business Control Association. I saw the proactive attitude of Tang Shoumin, the Director of the association, and the enthusiastic greetings of Mayor Chen, and I deeply feel that the National Business Control Association will definitely be able to achieve the purpose of control satisfactorily in the future. I believe that in order to fully develop the National Business Control Association, all the industrialists who have been elected as directors and supervisors can fully develop their strength and engage in work. This is also my deep expectation. As for the cooperative attitude adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Council towards this institution under the current situation, it goes without saying.</p>

<h3>Re-registration of Companies Extended for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry stated that the deadline for companies to complete supplementary registration and re-registration was the end of February of this year, which has now expired and should be terminated as scheduled. However, after investigating the companies applying for supplementary registration, the procedures are simple. In addition to terminating as scheduled, all companies applying for re-registration, either because the person in charge of the company has not yet returned, or because the shareholders are scattered in all directions, making it inconvenient to hold a public meeting, may have a small number of applications for postponement, which should be extended again to protect the legal interests of merchants and the public. Therefore, it will be extended for another three months to allow these companies to apply for registration. The municipal government has approved the ministry's consultation and has informed the Economic Bureau.</p>

<h3>The Great Path of Anti-British and Anti-Americanism</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhengping</p>
<p>Zhao Zhengping, the president of National Shanghai University, at the invitation of the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association on March 14th, broadcasted on Shanghai Radio a speech titled "The Great Path of Anti-British and Anti-Americanism." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>What I want to talk about tonight is "The Great Path of Anti-British and Anti-Americanism."</p>
<p>Last time, I broadcasted that opposing British and American interests is opposing British and American imperialism, not opposing ordinary British and American people. Why oppose imperialism? Because imperialism is aggression, and opposing imperialism is opposing aggression. This kind of aggression is not seen in our Eastern culture. In fact, those of us who have been immersed in Eastern civilization fundamentally lack the intention of aggression. To be fair, some parts of British and American imperialism, especially British imperialism, grew unconsciously, rather than being deliberately planned and intentionally created. Why did imperialism grow unconsciously? Because they already had a selfish and self-interested national concept. Therefore, wherever the British went, they formed a small Britain, infringing upon the rights of other countries. The East India Company's destruction of India is the clearest example. Establishing several independent countries and governments in the Americas and Australia is also a very clear example. They only knew about self-governance but did not care about the sovereignty of the local people. They only knew about self-sufficiency but did not care about the livelihood of the local people. They only knew about exercising their own political power but were unwilling to unite with or assist the local people in exercising political power. This is the reason why a completely aggressive imperialism was formed unconsciously. Therefore, while we oppose British and American interests, we must also recognize that the selfish and self-interested national concept is the cause of imperialism. However, we Easterners, especially the Chinese, not only lack a selfish and self-interested national concept, but fundamentally, even the so-called modern national concept is very淡薄. Our Chinese people's淡薄ness towards the nation is not because we Chinese are backward, but it is actually where our greatness lies. Because in the teachings of the Eastern civilization masters Confucius and Lao Tzu, as well as in the teachings of Confucius' disciples such as Mencius and Xun Qing, and the great philosophers before and after Confucius such as Lao Tzu and Mo Tzu, there is benevolence, etc., with humanity as the target. This kind of benevolence is not limited to one country but encompasses the whole world. In today's terms, it means taking benevolence towards all mankind as the target, without any selfish and self-interested national consciousness. According to Mo Tzu's theory of universal love, perhaps there are such instructions in Western religions, but they cannot be found in politics. Therefore, our Eastern philosophy inherently contains anti-imperialist factors. Therefore, in Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, it is clearly stated that British and American culture is the culture of霸道, while Eastern culture is the culture of王道. The culture of王道 of course does not allow the existence of the culture of霸道. Therefore, as long as we Easterners embrace this culture of王道, that is, develop and promote the culture centered on benevolence, righteousness, and morality, it will be the most powerful weapon against British and American interests.</p>
<p>As the ancient saying goes, under the sunlight, one cannot see the firefly. In the era when true王道 is flourishing, of course, one cannot see the shadow of霸道. Now the Axis powers are loudly advocating the establishment of a new European order, and our ally Japan is also vigorously promoting a new Asian order. What is the core idea of ​​this new order? Of course, it is mutual love between countries, not the strong bullying the weak. Of course, it is mutual assistance between people, not self-interest among people. In fact, only this spirit can establish a new order. For example, our ally Japan already has the eight紘一宇 character, which is a fundamental concept centered on justice and humanity, and is already steadily advancing it, such as the liberation of Burma and the liberation of the Malays. All facts have been realized. In the future, the days when the new Asia is mutually親善 and mutually supportive will be the time when British and American imperialism is completely eliminated. This is the great path of anti-British and anti-Americanism.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Coal Stockpiles Will Not Be Allowed to be Moved, Subject to Severe Penalties; Those Registered Can Apply for Movement Permits</h3>
<p>The China United Coal Company has now completed all the stockpile registrations, totaling over 14,000 tons of bituminous and anthracite coal. The company has reported the registration situation to the Shanghai Coal Association, stipulating that registered stockpiles can apply for movement permits. It is said that measures have been determined for stockpiles that have not been registered as scheduled. In the future, in addition to not being allowed to move, they will also be subject to severe penalties in accordance with regulations. It is understood that the purpose of the China United Coal Company being entrusted to handle the stockpile registration is to clearly know the exact amount of bituminous and anthracite coal currently stored in Shanghai (including Pudong, Hongkou, the French Concession, etc.). Recently, due to the inability of various industries to produce in large quantities, and the weather is gradually warming, the daily coal consumption of factories and residents has sharply decreased. Therefore, the coal stocks in Shanghai are sufficient for application. Moreover, bituminous and anthracite coal produced from North China, Korea, and other places are still continuously arriving here. The future of fuel is becoming more stable.</p>
<h3>Vaccination Certificates Required for Travel to Other Ports; Vaccination and Certificate Issuance Procedures</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department has vaccination certificate application procedures. Passengers who wish to leave Shanghai for other ports must submit their citizen certificate or residence certificate, along with a fee of $2.50. After the Health Department administers the vaccination, the certificate will be issued, with a two-inch photo of the person attached. As for the certificates applicable to this port, they are issued free of charge. To date, this vaccination is not mandatory. The Health Department will soon forcibly vaccinate on the streets or door-to-door. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will go voluntarily as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Fire Kills Girl Three fires occurred in the Nanshi area yesterday in one day. One was at the home of Qiu Huiliang at No. 6, Lane 33, Houjia Road. The fire started at 4:30 PM and spread to Nos. 7 and 8. A six-year-old girl, Yueqin, was tragically burned to death on the spot. When the fire was raging, the sparks were blown by the wind to No. 13, Jiushi Road, Xinyuan Road, Yuyuan Temple, causing another fire at 7:00 PM, destroying the roof of the three-story building. At about 11:00 PM in the evening, a fire broke out at the home of Zheng Renyou, who dealt in seafood at No. 11, Dasheng Lane. The fire burned for more than an hour before being extinguished. Zheng's wife, Shi, holding a three-year-old child, jumped from the window on the third floor and was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Huxi Rationing Regarding the Huxi district, because of the shortage of food rice in the sixth period, the seventh period will be sold first. It is heard that the grain ration is still calculated at two liters per person per ten days, all of which is whole rice, and the selling price remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Investigation of Superstition Donations The Municipal Finance Bureau is investigating superstition donations. The Municipal Finance Bureau is investigating the collection of goods donations for banning superstitious activities. The areas of Hubei, Hudong, the city center, and the two special districts are actively investigating. Regarding the seven districts of this city, Fengxian, Beiqiao, Nanhui, Chuansha, Chongming Baoshan, and Jiading, they have now begun to delineate areas and dispatch personnel to carry out the investigation and will issue a notice for registration in late this month.</p>

<h3>Organizational Plan of the Education Colleagues Cooperative</h3>
<p>— Chen Guanyu</p>
<p>The article "Organizing the Teachers' Welfare Association" by Mr. Yu, published on March 5th, is deeply sympathized with by people in the education sector. However, public groups find it difficult to handle affairs effectively. Therefore, colleagues believe that it is not enough to organize and launch a "Education Colleagues Cooperative" in accordance with the company organization and raise shares to achieve results.</p>
<p>Our preliminary outline of the company organization is - the total share capital is 2 million yuan, divided into 20,000 shares, each share is 100 yuan, with an official interest of 1%. There are also dividends. For schools, schools with less than 100 students, universities should recognize at least 10 shares, middle schools 5 shares, and elementary schools 3 shares. For every 20 additional students, one additional share will be added. For faculty and staff, each person should recognize at least one share. There are more than 700 large and small schools in Shanghai. At an average of 5 shares per school, more than 350,000 yuan can be obtained. There are about 7,8,000 faculty and staff, and more than 780,000 yuan can be obtained. The sum of the two has exceeded 1 million yuan. It is not difficult to add freely recognized shares to make up 2 million. Introduce shareholders with large shares, who are promoted as directors and enjoy special rights and interests, in order to work extra hard.</p>
<p>The general outline of the company's business - (1) Request permission from the authorities to purchase necessities of life in large quantities from producers or manufacturers, and distribute them to each shareholder at the lowest price. (2) Centrally handle books, stationery, paper, ink, and printing of forms, regulations, and all printed materials. (3) Publish jointly compiled textbooks. (4) Organize interest-free loans for shareholders, and 整借零還 loans. (5) Sell or exchange old books and all old furniture and clothing on consignment. (6) Post joint recruitment advertisements and introduce jobs. (7) Special doctors and pharmacies provide shareholders with cheap or赊欠 medical treatment and medicine. (8) A special public canteen and dormitory are provided for shareholders to prepare meals and lodging cheaply. (9) Collect tuition fees, pay expenses on behalf, and operate interest on behalf. (10) Special public experimental institutes, libraries, and sports fields are provided for shareholders to use. The regulations have now been drafted, and the equipment office is located at No.中中字 in the new market at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Moore Ming Road.</p>
<p>Economic Circle Evaluation</p>
<h3>Controlled Economy and Improved Transportation</h3>
<p>The Provisional Regulations on the National Commercial Control Association and the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Materials Movement Restriction have now been promulgated and are being actively implemented. The people's organization, under the supervision of the government, manages and controls the purchase and allocation of materials, the operation of material exchange in various parts of the country, the supply of export materials, the allocation of import materials, and the procurement of military supplies from the standpoint of autonomy. In the future, material control matters will have a sound organization and a complete plan. Moreover, due to the promulgation of the Wartime Materials Movement Restriction Regulations, the previous control methods can be eased, so that under reasonable circumstances, materials in various places can be exchanged smoothly. If we can cooperate from top to bottom and implement it fairly, it will be a great achievement in stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Originally, the circulation of materials, in addition to the necessary restrictions during extraordinary times, should try to avoid the occurrence of local regionalization. This is to seek reasonable circulation of materials from the perspective of the system and the organization of control. However, without the tools of circulation, there is still no effect. Therefore, after having a sound organization, there must also be tools for circulation, and the most important issue is transportation. The current shortage of boats and vehicles is certainly an unavoidable phenomenon, but within the possible range, we must strive for convenient transportation methods, increased transportation efficiency, and reduced transportation costs. This is to allocate appropriate distribution and improve transportation management. So that the system and the tools are convenient for both, and the exchange of materials is naturally smooth.</p>
<h3>The China Central Cigarette Combination's Distribution Method is Fully Determined</h3>
<p>In order to uniformly handle the distribution of cigarettes, the China Central Tobacco Allocation Combination has completed the registration of all large and small cigarette retailers in the city, and all preparations have been completed. It has been decided to implement the allocation in the short term. Large retailers who have passed the examination have paid their "confidence deposit" from the 15th, and must complete the payment by the 17th. The "confidence deposit" is divided into Grade A, which is 50,000 yuan, and Grade B, which is 30,000 yuan. The deposit is collected by the Jiaotong Tobacco Industry Bank, and then a signboard of the designated wholesaler is obtained from the combination, specializing in handling the consignment of goods for small retailers. It is heard that large wholesalers have each filled out contracts, stipulating that the method must be complied with, and those who violate it will be investigated in accordance with the law. Strict sanctions have been established for participating in black market cigarette transactions. Regarding small retailers, the investigation and review have been completed, totaling more than 5,000 households, and they have been compiled into grades, completely based on the business conditions of each retailer. In the future, all products from the 無輸軍管理 Central Tobacco Company, the Japanese China Tobacco Company, and the Chinese factories such as Nanyang, Huacheng Fuxin, and Dadong will be centrally allocated by the combination. As for the registration of cigarette wholesalers in the suburbs of Shanghai, it is under review. The allocation in various places outside the China Central area has also been started. Therefore, after the implementation of the allocation, there will be no black market for cigarettes, and the prices sold by each retailer will be the fair prices set by the combination.</p>
<h3>Selling Activity Causes the Sharp Drop in the Federal Reserve Note - Down 14 Points From the Previous Day -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Federal Reserve Note showed a backlash, falling back. This was mainly due to the huge increase of more than 50 cents in the past four days. Although there was news that it was naturally equivalent to military tickets, there was selling activity, and the 日客胃轉淡. Therefore, the return was also huge. Operators sold it off, starting from around 4 yuan and retreating to as low as 3 yuan and 88 cents. Receipts were 3 yuan and 83 cents, down 14 points from the previous day. The retail sale price was also lowered to 3 yuan and 95 cents. Receipts were only 3 yuan and 75 cents, and the trend was very 軟弱.</p>
<p>The Japanese military ticket still has little change. The inter-industry trading price is 5 yuan, 55 cents, and 35厘. Small money houses and bank retail sales are 5 yuan and 56 cents, and the receipt is 4 and a half cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the discount rate of the money industry association was still 18 points.</p>
<h3>Abundant Oilseed Raw Materials; Edible Oil Prices Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>Rapeseed is the raw material for oil extraction. The annual output of Suzhou, Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway is very abundant. Therefore, oil mills are lined up in various places. Last year, due to the poor harvest of rapeseed in various places, there was panic about edible oil, and there were no raw materials for oil extraction in various places, which led to soaring oil prices. However, this year, in Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, the rapeseed sprouts have grown very quickly due to the warm weather since the arrival of spring. Therefore, it is expected that the rapeseed in various places will definitely have a bumper harvest. After the new goods are listed on the market and the oil mills in various places start work, the edible oil repayment price will definitely fall.</p>

<h3>Local Chinese Stock Firms Jointly Petition the Industry Department</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council cracked down on the illegal trading of 高股票 companies, implemented strict supervision, and ordered all Chinese stock firms to register with the authorities and obtain licenses before continuing to operate, the Chinese stock companies in Shanghai have been complying with the authorities' laws and seeking an early recovery of the stock market. They registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council to obtain licenses as soon as possible, and组建同業公會, to closely unite the industry. Yesterday, the Chinese stock companies, in order to seek an early resumption of business and to alleviate the livelihood of the companies, jointly petitioned the Ministry of Industry for relief.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Charcoal United Association Plans to Open the China Central Charcoal Agreement Conference</h3>
<p>Determine Prices - Coordinate Supply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charcoal United Association, in order to ensure local self-sufficiency, is currently discussing specific methods with the relevant authorities and has assigned staff to conduct on-site investigations in various parts of China Central, which has been completed. Around the time of the day, representatives of the assembly platforms in various production and consumption areas of China Central will be convened to hold the China Central Charcoal Agreement Conference. The main agenda is to separately determine the prices of each production area, adjust the supply, and prevent smuggling. This kind of consultative conference is planned to be held at any time if there is an urgent need in the future. (March 16th 大陸新報)</p>
<h3>Yen Quasi-Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>This dispatch from Domei News Agency states that the limit on the exchange of yen from China Central to Japan has been increased from 500 yen to 5,000 yen. This is the result of the stronger relationship between the Japanese military ticket and the savings券 exchange. The Shanghai office of the Japanese Ministry of Finance has notified Japanese banks of this move. The maximum amount of remittances from Japan to China Central will still be 200 yen. Remittances exceeding these two limits must be approved by the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Paper-Making Raw Materials in This City</h3>
<p>The raw materials for paper-making in this city, that is, paper pulp, have always relied on imports from Manchuria. This year, Manchuria has indicated that it cannot supply them, so the source of raw materials has become a major problem. The people in the industry, in order to alleviate the panic, have decided to send a representative to Manchuria to negotiate. At the same time, the hope for Manchuria is very thin, so a special envoy will be sent to Japan, hoping that if Manchuria cannot import, it can still be obtained from Japan.</p>
<h3>Measures for Free Trading of Coarse Grains; According to Military Allocation Group Regulations</h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities allowed free trading of coarse grains. The Shanghai Coarse Grain Group Firms Joint Office, which is responsible for the allocation of coarse grains, convened a general meeting, re-elected directors and supervisors, and strengthened the organization and improved the supply and adjustment policies. According to the person in charge of the group, the group is currently operating in a consistent manner, and believes that serving the society and seeking the welfare of the industry are the only principles. Regarding the trading methods of the coarse grain industry, the military allocation group will still stipulate the allocation volume. (1) Oil raw materials, including soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and cottonseed, will be purchased by the military allocation group at 75%, and the price will be set by the military allocation group. 25% will be traded freely by members. (2) Ordinary coarse grains, including corn, red beans, and broad beans, will be purchased by the military allocation group at 50%, and the price will also be designated by the military allocation authority. 50% will be traded freely by members. (3) If there are麻袋, they will be included by the guild when applying for a transportation permit.</p>

<h3>Hankou Customs to be Restored</h3>
<p>The Hankou Customs has been suspended for a long time. Recently, due to the change in Japan's policy toward China, it will soon resume collecting import and export taxes and transit taxes. The period should be around April 1st.</p>
<h3>Price Control</h3>
<p>— Huang Xuanping</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Guanping of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Goods Control Committee, recently made some comments on the issue of price control. Excerpts of the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Economic Theory and Finance</p>
<p>It is necessary to re-examine economic and financial issues under the new situation after December 8th of the year before last. Now, let's examine it from the perspective of economics and the current environment.</p>
<p>First, the demand for materials is now strong. However, the supply is mostly subject to control and concealment, a very different situation. It cannot be easily resolved by relying solely on old theories.</p>
<p>Second, old theories have somewhat neglected the benefits of controlling finances. Contemporary economists must be able to control prices through financial expansion or restraint measures.</p>
<p>Third, materials are divided into essential and non-essential. China is more than 90% self-sufficient in essential materials. For non-essential items such as imported goods, the source has been cut off and cannot be restored, so the price has soared indefinitely. However, the prices of essential materials are necessities of life. Under the current special circumstances, the price of non-essential items should not be used as a standard for the price of essential items.</p>
<p>Fourth, China has always been known as a country with abundant resources. The production in Central China is more than enough to maintain the current new legal currency, so the legal currency has its true value. Therefore, it is not difficult to control prices.</p>
<p>(2) Finance and Prices</p>
<p>The current amount of Central Reserve Bank currency circulating in the Shanghai area is estimated at 200,000,000,000 yuan. The old legal currency previously circulating in the city was estimated to be 300,000,000,000 yuan. In other words, the circulation of the new legal currency is only two-thirds of the old legal currency.</p>
<p>If loans are not controlled, unscrupulous merchants often take the opportunity to use their materials to continue mortgaging loans, buy up goods as much as possible, and seek profit, resulting in unwarranted price increases. Therefore, loans should be limited to important industries.</p>
<p>(3) The Function of Price Control</p>
<p>The soundest situation for a social economic institution is the stability of prices. At that time, prices are neither high nor low. During currency inflation, the phenomenon is high prices, abundant profits, booming business, secure jobs, easy credit, and low interest rates, creating a seemingly prosperous atmosphere. However, general wages cannot keep up with prices, and the livelihoods of the wage-earning class are worsening. Although capitalists appear unaffected, their actual gains are ultimately equal to empty bubbles.</p>
<p>During currency deflation, the phenomenon is low prices, meager profits, sluggish business, high unemployment, tight credit, high interest rates, and a decline in all industries.</p>
<p>Since investors rely on commodities as a tool for business competition in order to seek exorbitant profits, price control must be implemented universally.</p>
<p>The composition of prices depends on the supply and demand of materials. When materials circulate, prices will naturally fall. Therefore, the production of goods occupies the most important position in any social economic function. But at this time, the best policy is to suppress prices as soon as possible to maintain people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Controlling prices is the responsibility of the government authorities. Taking more stringent and effective measures to crack down on speculation and hoarding is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>On March 4th of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced in principle regulations restricting loans. Taking this prompt step was timely. All financial organizations must be ordered to join a general association as members. The association should strictly supervise all activities, which must be subject to jurisdiction. All kinds of lending should be limited to important real industries to be effective.</p>

<h3>The Fight for "Life"</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>The sunlight doesn't reach the corners of the streets.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't the old quartermaster who delivers the food come yet?" The little beggar crouched next to the trash can was thinking. His sunken eyes were forever fixed on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>He thought that there would be at least one more fight to perform today. He couldn't help but turn around to look at the old beggar behind him, his comrade on the hunger line, but their stomachs didn't allow them to be friendly to each other. As soon as the fat man's food basket arrived, everyone would have to take off the mask of humanity and struggle for it.</p>
<p>The fat man staggered over with his burden. Look! The old beggar and the beggars who had come from elsewhere were all there, rubbing their fists, gnashing their teeth…</p>
<p>He also stood up. Where did the strength come from? He seemed to feel a heat boiling in his body. He rushed ahead like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey to open the lid of the food basket.</p>
<p>"There's nothing left today—" the fat man shouted.</p>
<p>As usual, there were a hundred "I don't believe it's." The hungry group surrounded him.</p>
<p>"Be careful of the pot!" the fat man shouted.</p>
<p>Actually, what's so strange? "You," "me," and "stomach" are all "friends for life and death."</p>
<p>Really! The food basket was empty!</p>
<p>"I told you a long time ago that there wasn't any left. What's the price of "food" now?" the fat man complained as he packed up.</p>
<p>They dispersed! Crestfallen, a group even hungrier than before.</p>
<p>The little beggar looked at his newly torn coat with pity.</p>
<p>Let's sit down again! Disappointed? No! It's waiting, waiting for the fat man's dinner. It's noon now, so there are six more hours?</p>
<p>But the little beggar's stomach really couldn't allow him to wait six long hours. What to do! He stood up again.</p>
<p>There are many food stalls on the street, and many in women's baskets.</p>
<p>So there was one more little thief in society.</p>
<h3>Humility and Sincerity</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>We should humbly accept people's good intentions and guidance. If we are doing things, we should work with sincerity.</p>
<p>"Humbly accept well-intentioned guidance, and sincerely deal with our work." This is an unbreakable law, or in other words, a necessary condition for success. Therefore, we can only achieve success by "humbly accepting" and "sincerely working."</p>
<p>The relationship between "humbly accepting" and "sincerely working" is very simple, but there are still many people who confuse "humility" and "sincerity." Why? Because they use "humility" in work and "sincerity" in acceptance.</p>
<p>We should use an objective attitude—humility—to accept well-intentioned guidance, and use subjective power—sincerity—to work. This is the attitude we should have when doing things.</p>
<h3>Su Qin and Yan Hui</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>There is a record in the Records of the Warring States: "Su Qin wanted to sleep while studying, so he used an awl to pierce his thigh, and the blood flowed to his ankles..." Therefore, fathers and brothers often use Su Qin's bitter spirit to teach their children. I hope to emulate him even more.</p>
<p>Actually? Judging from the starting point and goal of studying, Su Qin was just a fool. He didn't understand the true meaning of studying at all. He regarded studying as a painful thing. Therefore, his starting point was not voluntary, and his goal? That's even more absurd. He completely wanted to be promoted and make a fortune, so he stabbed a hole with an awl and crammed some stiff and dead knowledge into it.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is also a record in the Analects: "A basket of rice, a ladle of drink, living in a humble lane, others cannot bear the sorrow, but Hui does not change his happiness." Yan Hui's spirit of being quick to learn and eager to learn is the true attitude to learning. His learning is completely from the heart. He is voluntary, even though he lives in a humble alley, cannot eat enough, and cannot keep warm, Zu still cannot shake his belief in learning in the slightest. No wonder Confucius said he was virtuous and a good disciple.</p>
<p>These are two famous hard-working scholars in history, but because one is voluntary and the other is passive, it is obvious that later generations have different levels of respect for them. On the one hand, they cannot inspire the true meaning of learning, and on the other hand, they tell us that only things that are voluntarily sought from the bottom of our hearts are valuable and meaningful. Otherwise, it's just a standard fool</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xinbo</p>
<p>Everyone was very nervous, but only Laibodong didn't ask or hear, his head drooped and he was dozing off. Sometimes his body darted forward, almost falling to the ground, so he quickly braced his feet and sat up straighter. Xue Fengchun simply stood up, gave the stool to Yang Zijie to sit on, and he walked quietly onto the kang, quietly and watching the ceiling while smoking.</p>
<p>Huang Chong'an smoked his water pipe more forcefully, and the gurgling sound was indeed unusually loud. Even when blowing away the ashes and putting in the smoke cylinder, he couldn't help but make strange or loud noises that were rarely heard, so that people knew how unhappy he was.</p>
<p>"I won't force you if you don't want to sign a death contract," Yang Zijie said again to mediate, "Then let's do this, let's say it's fifty-six yuan: if the Second Yuan money Huang Lord is unwilling to recognize it, I will pay it out."</p>
<p>"Two more yuan is still not enough..." Genming still didn't let go.</p>
<p>"If you know that Mr. Huang has to spend all the expenses!"</p>
<p>They just argued with each other, and Yu Duzhou picked up his pen and waited, dipping the tip of his pen into the inkstone from time to time, making a leisurely posture. After dipping it, he picked it up and looked at it, then said, "It's especially cold now, I really have to freeze it." After saying that, he put it in his mouth and sucked on it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a boy of ten years old rushed in. He didn't say a word, he rushed straight to Yu Duzhou's seat, pulled open the drawer in front of Yu Duzhou, raised his feet, stretched his neck, and fumbled inside with both hands. Yu Zhou was still holding the pen at first, and moved his body a little, waiting for him to look for it in the drawer. Later, he couldn't stand the squeezing, so he stood up and waited by the side. (Thirteen)</p>
<h3>Thousand-pound Burden</h3>
<p>— Tianming Painting</p>
<h3>Optimistic Life</h3>
<p>— Cheng Da</p>
<p>I have met many people who seem to be very "optimistic." Some say, "Take it one day at a time." Some say, "Drink today while you have wine." I feel that these two sentences thoroughly reflect the attitude of life generally held by people in the current society.</p>
<p>The people who "take it one day at a time" have already decided on the calculation of "getting by." As long as there is no uncomfortable pain in their hearts today, then they are still "optimistic." If there is not enough rice in the house, there is no oil, or they are blocked on the road, then their psychology will change immediately, from "optimistic" to "pessimistic." But once all the problems are solved, they gradually become "optimistic" again.</p>
<p>As for the people who "drink today while you have wine," they are even more "optimistic." They not only "live it up" but also "think it through," adhering to the purpose of "enjoying the present." So dance halls, theaters, tea rooms, restaurants, gambling halls, brothels... All the places that can provide "enjoyment" are gone. There is a feeling that this is not enough to express "optimism." But "enjoying" requires money, so they search and scrape everywhere. Those with greater abilities climb on top of people, and those with less abilities attach themselves to the rich. The more people "living it up" outside, the more "living it up" and "optimistic" they become.</p>
<p>In fact, a truly optimistic life focuses on the spiritual aspect rather than the material aspect. Don't we all have one or more "hopes"? For example, I hope that my health will be better next year than this year. Or we all hope that rice prices will drop in the near future. All such "hopes" are possible to realize. Before the "hope" is realized, we don't have to worry, don't have to envy "enjoying the present," and don't have to have the negative attitude of "getting by." If we try our best to cherish ourselves, live a regular, non-degenerate, always helpful, and more serious life, then we will have our "hope" ahead of us. Therefore, I think that the lives of "taking it one day at a time" and "drinking today while you have wine" are all "unreliable and easily become pessimistic" false "optimistic lives"; only "hopeful and serious lives" are truly optimistic lives.</p>
