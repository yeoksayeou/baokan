<h3 id="c1">迎大東亞戰爭第三年 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭到今天兩周年了！我們在南太平洋大捷聲中紀念這一轉變歷史的戰爭，不但値得俊幸，同時，吿訴我們這一戰爭必定能够很迅速的完遂勝利的！</p>
<p>中國參戰也已十一個月了，我們會在此時期內數度爲文反省，以促起朝野共同警覺。</p>
<p>我們今天對於大東亞戰爭固應與奮，可是對於我們自己協力戰爭一點，還須作切切實實的反省：第一，我們參戰以後實際協力些什麼？第二，我們對於大東亞戰爭是否具備了必勝的信念？反省的結果，或許使我們慚愧，因爲上面的兩個問題，不必諱言的，我們沒有方法肯定的答覆。然而，爲了中國的命運，爲了大東亞的命運，我們絕對的需要堅定信念，協力戰爭。大東亞戰爭第三年的課題，我們願意提供數點於次：</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭兩年中，盟邦日本業巳動員一切從事作戰，在此第三年開始之時，我們不必再偏重於口頭的宣傳，巳到了實踐時期，力行時期。我們應當一致體騐實踐的重要，在政府方面實踐戰時體制，推行戰時政令，官吏方面，以身作則，領導人民，實踐戰時生活。</p>
<p>協力大東亞戰爭，是中國獨立生存唯一的途徑。所以，就中國命運的本身立論，對於大東亞戰爭的勝利，爲必須爭取的。依賴於英美的重慶政權之終歸失敗，騎牆主義之心理終歸失敗，乃爲必然之事</p>
<p>協力大東亞戰爭，一切都須從基本上做起，尤須先使自己國家健全。怎樣使國家健全呢？第一，人民應有參與政治的權利，俾人民與政府打成一片。第二，人民生活安定，樂爲國用。第三，經濟建設發達，資源盡量開發利用，如果，捨此數點而談協力戰爭，其結果仍難免蹈過去落空的覆轍。</p>
<p>國家之興盛，當然不能全責諸政府，一般人民都須負責，人民一面固應擁護政府國策，一面就須督促政府革新政治，澄淸吏治。</p>
<p>總之，大東亞戰爭第三年，將是決戰勝利之年，我們中國，一方面旣須協力爭取勝利，以盡東亞一環的職責，一方面更須健全國脈，以成東亞有力的一員。</p>
<h3 id="c2">以刻苦耐勞精神協力建設大東亞　汪主席發表談話激勵國民 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　今（八日）日爲大東亞戰爭兩週年紀念日，國府注主席特發表談話，指出東亞前途之光明，並激勵全國民衆以刻苦耐勞勇猛精進之精神，協力完途戰爭，建設東亞，同時痛斥渝方甘受英美指使，爲反嘩東亞叛逆，全國民衆應一致奮起驅除云云茲恭錄如下：</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭開始以來，盟邦日本奮其國力，將英美大東亞之侵略勢力予以粉碎，最近大東亞宣言更顯示大東亞共榮之光明前途，值茲大東亞戰爭二週年紀念之日，余謹向盟邦政府及前方將士後方國民努力奮門建樹空前偉績，致最大之敬意。同時益常激勵全國民衆以刻苦耐勞勇猛精進之精神，努力於大東亞戰爭目的之完遂，及大東亞共榮建設之完全實現。渝方人士在八九月間巳有和平傾向，無如少數敗類，挾持勢力，壓迫民意，勾結英美倒行逆施。最近羅邱蔣在開羅會談，散佈習說，調須戰至日本無條件降服，並須將日本降爲三等國，無論兩年以來，英美在大束亞戰爭中節節敗北，最近美國海軍復蒙重創，窘態畢露，如此大言不慚，徒滋笑柄，而渝方盲從附和，實不啻明白說出巳完全抛棄當初抗戰之目的，而甘心受英美之指使以推及於東亞之同胞，眞可謂巨　極戾，若任其狡逞，勢必使中國半壁終昭於無底之架淵，所願全國同胞，一致奮起，驅除此等反噬束亞之叛逆，爲中國進去汚點，爲東亞增進光明，余對於時局深感使命之重大，惟有夙夜匪懈，力求進步，並以至鋮，視　大東亞最後勝利之早日到臨。</p>
<h3 id="c3">鮑斯在昭南表示决為印獨立奮門　並確信最後勝利必屬日本 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>昭南七日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉　斯氏，際茲大東亞戰爭二週年紀念發表談話，要旨如次：凡革命家皆以成功爲目的。於歐亞兩洲同時勃發戰爭一事，乃余二十年來所希望者。就歐洲戰爭而言，其將予人類以如何之影響，在前次大戰中已有所體騐。余在此次大束亞戰爭勃發以前，曾密切注意日本之外交，又當歐戰勃發時，亦會注意共與束亞之影響。同時余曾攷慮日蘇與日美關係之發展，但在日松岡外相訪蘇訂立日蘇協定之後，所餘者僅日美關係，但來栖大使赴美時，余對之更爲關心。是時德國權威方面人士曾根據各釉情報，斷定戰爭結果美國必將敗北，而余確信勝利必屬日本。余亦佔計英國之戰力甚低，蓋英國惟美國是賴，是以余深信英美絕非日本之對手。當余作是想時，而大東亞戰爭即告勃發，自是以來日軍述戰連捷，迭獲驚人之戰果，更充分證明余觀察之正確。余正式開始獨立運動者，乃在新加坡陷落之後，余之左右以前巳數次勸余推進獨立運動，但余認爲獨立運動機構成後，方可着手推進，並確信此種機會，必將來臨。當余聞悉日軍攻陷新加坡時，歡欣之情，實非言語所測形容。余本諸一般印度人之立塲，評論此次戰爭之意義，確信　印度之獨立乃輕而易舉之事。　亞洲人已打破所謂一等國家之英美。印度目前戰局實已至進攻印度之階段，現余具有決意報續奮門，直到奪囘吾人祖國印度而後已。</p>
<h3 id="c4">滿張總理　談話要旨　努力增產强化國防 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>新京七日中央社電　際此大束亞戰爭二周年紀念日之前夕，滿洲國張國務總理特發表談話，激勵國民，其要旨如次：大東亞戰爭勃發以來，於茲巳二周年，過去一年中，英·美目不顧開戰以來之莫大犧牲，迭在各方面作執拗之反攻，但一與日軍正義之師接觸觸其企圖則已悉被粉碎。日軍之所向無廠。實令人驚嘆，尤其南方海戰之數次激戰，日軍更曾收獲歷史上空前之戰果，隨戰局之進展，建設大東亞之偉大工作，亦已着着推進。蓋歲首有中華民國之雜然參戰，雜則緬。非兩國亦先後獨立，自由印度臨時政府亦　定其基礎，客月大東亞各國代表，更曾會聚東京，舉行大束亞會議，發表大東亞共同宣言。本宣言蓋即向全世界宣布大東亞各國家，各民族相協相助，擊滅英美，建設新秩序之決意者，故實可謂爲千古不磨之一大憲章。由此大東亞之團結，巳愈益鞏固，大東亞戰爭之必勝，更洞若觀火。當此局勢下，我滿洲國爲完成衛護北邊之重責，增强戰力之大任，當舉全力以增產食糧物資及强化國土防衛之途邁。</p>

<p>南京七日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍畑總司令官，當茲大東亞戰爭二週年紀念日，特發表談話稱，自對英美宣戰之大詔頒發以來，已二年於斯，仰伏聖威，因日本將士之忠勇善戰，於日本有史以來所未曾有之廣大戰域內，刻已確保磐石不動之態勢，及必勝不敗之戰勢，以迎此戰爭第三年之來臨，於此期間，日駐華派逍軍恒先發制人，隨時隨地粉碎渝軍及駐渝美空軍之企圖。日本之眞意，在以大束亞戰爭確保東亞之安定，以期確保東亞永遠之和平，此項眞意，刻巳愈益闡明。且日本對中國所採之不動國策，亦日益以事實呈示於中國民衆之前，其中於目前所締結之中日同盟條約，巳徹底覆　渝方之抗戰名目。然渝方當茲決定東亞民族運命之一大轉機時，仍隱恃英美之勢力，未悟抗戰之非，為東亞十億民族之前途計，實堪悲痛，而嗾使渝方企圖制霸東亞之英美，今後所展開之反攻，必愈益執拗，而彼於屢收之後，亟謀加强中國方面之空軍勢力，以圖挽囘頹勢，此項策略，尤決不容輕視。然日本於政戰兩略上，巳確立堅固之態勢，對於完遂大東亞戰爭途上，一切反動勢力，必澈底予以擊毀。按大東亞戰爭之眞義，在於中日關係之正常解決，及兩國國民之公正提拂合作後，以完成東亞民族之共同團結。日駐華派遣軍於中國戰棧上，直接擔當此項重大局勢，故感所負之責任已愈益重大。當茲大東亞戰爭二週年來臨之際，日駐華派遣軍將士於敬謹奉戴大詔及緬想後方國民所具眞摯熱烈之態勢，鑒於派遣軍光榮之歷史及傳統，決率全軍以鐵石之團結，以期澈底實現國家最高之方針，不達目的決不休止。</p>

<p>爪加爾達七日中央社電　爪哇中參院議長史加爾諾，五日下午二時在中央議事堂招集全體議員，舉行訪日報告會發表演說，報告達成訪日目的之經過，說明日本國民之團結精神。並稱日本視大東亞戰爭爲聖戰，蓋大東亞之運命乃繫諸日木之最後勝利，故爪哇住民應努力貢獻大東亞共榮圈之建設，以創造未來之命運。</p>

<p>廣州七日中央社電　値茲大東亞戰爭二週年，日華南派遣軍當局，頃就當前渝方動向發表談話，其大意謂：大東亞戰爭發生以來，迄今巳屆二週年，渝方仍高呼抗戰，然共實渝方並無如其所宣傳之抗戰能力。因大東亞戰爭發生以來，日本實施對華新政策，巳使渝方抗戰目的逐次喪失，試就渝方空軍方面而言，殆不見其雙影，且最近完全受美空軍之指揮。他如國內情形之逐漸喪失共繼續抗戰之要素。夫現代戰爭，乃消耗戰爭，一方面開發資源，增加生產，另一方面更須要受相當訓練之人力，渝方對此殆無準備可言。所謂開發西北，僅爲宣傳，並無成績，渝方因缺乏煤鐵，故除求英美接濟以外，實無法維持其戰力，且時至今日，渝方一部重要物資，已供給英美作為接濟代價。以渝方人力視之，似極豐富，但現代戰爭上所需要之人力與平常不同，重慶軍隊缺管訓練，又無戰意，且其人力不能不謂非常貧弱，渝方在此種狀態之下，若繼續抗戰，則徒使渝方民衆日趨崩潰。反觀日軍，自中日事變發生以來，即逐次擴大在華各地和平地區，亞與各地民衆打成一片，努力建設工作。華南方面中日軍官民亦巳打成一片，除舊　沃之三角洲地帶努力增產食糧外，並積極强化並培補既成產業，最近與香港之陸上聯絡巳告完成，華南經濟建設得有飛蹤之發展。又廣州近將與南方各地開始交通，今大東亞各民族巳團結一致，共同努力完遂大束亞戰爭，想中國國父孫先生亦必含笑於九泉。中日兩國在軍事經濟文化各方面，巳相互協力建設大東並，此種現狀，渝方實難否認，但其竟予漠視，而甘為英美走狗，且使此軍隊爲英美之奴隷軍，繼續對日抗戰，實可謂係對孫文先生之叛逆行爲，渝方今後踨繼續抗戰，但絕難阻止大東亞建設，吾人將於最　之將來，以一種事實昭示渝方，即我人將來完成大東亞共榮圖之建設。以東亞各民族綜合之威力，擊滅英美是也。</p>

<p>芬京七日中央社電　據海通社訊，芬蘭總統里茶於芬闌獨立紀念二十六週年紀念日發表學說稱：數日以後，此次大戰之經過時期，即可與上次大戰相等，常時歐洲之主要交戰國多已精疲力盡，其結果早在預料之中。今日之情形雖與前次不同，然亦已有許多交戰國已不支而倒或被佔領，但主要之交戰國仍堅强如恒，且其力量有較前更為增加者，故此次戰爭，結束之期猶難預測，當然戰爭的前途猶多變化，故歐洲之國際局勢，尙難期穩定。</p>
<p>消滅小國人類罪行　　目前之發展對於小國之地位，似將有重大影響，其中立地位亦未嘗爲人尊電，雖大四洋憲章及其池文件承認小國生存之權利，但一般人之意見似在不承認小國之止存，此誠不常巳極。蓋小國不但不應殲滅，而大國且應尊重其獨立，惟獨立之國家始能有助於世界之文化。波羅的海諸小國，在極艱雖之情形中而獲得獨立，可爲未來發展之基礎，且小國均擁護和平及國　間之組織，對於人類貢獻較任何軍事强國爲大，故消減小國實爲對整個人類之罪行，片面武斷以消滅小國爲目的之和平決難持久，蓋失去獨立之國家必思有以恢復之。</p>
<p>委曲求全不免浩刦</p>
<p>此次戰爭已成爲全面戰爭，其結果自不免促成國與國間之仇恨，共報復之心必致影響於戰後。在此次戰爭前，芬蘭係與各國維持友好，故嚴格遵守國際條約，欲圖不牽入戰爭。芬蘭深知與蘇聯之關係須以信任及友誼爲基後，故竭力與其修好，然而結果仍不免於浩刦，若謂列寗格勒受芬蘭之威脅，此語顯然難以令人置信即便欲保護列寗格勒，亦毋須發動流血之戰爭，社而併吞卡萊里亞，四年來芬蘭被迫進行防　戰，常以保障芬蘭之生命與獨立爲目的，吾人集中力量捍衛疆土，上蒼似不加保佑。</p>
<p>恩仇分明決不降服</p>
<p>一九四〇年以後，芬蘭　類馬鈴署等總收獲量，較戰事爆發前減少百分之二十至三十，穀類之缺乏，常賴德國與丹麥之接濟，加以彌補。芬蘭於牢記友邦之協助，吾人巳經過各種困難與危險。目前敵方要求芬闌無條件投降矣，無條件投降之先例，不足以引誘芬蘭，余不信芬蘭之忠誠公民，視對蘇無條件投降爲可能也。芬蘭割讓卡萊里亞與蘇聯後，卡萊里亞民衆四十七萬人，即離開故鄉，不願受蘇聯之統治，民心之向背，亳無疑義。芬蘭民衆之見解，必與卞萊里亞民衆相同，芬蘭人在運動界以持久力著名，在國際戰爭中，亦巳表現其持久力。芬軍深信正義必能勝利，不惜爲國捐軀，吾人均認　作戰之目標，吾人之奮鬥，顯示小國爲自由與獨立之千城。</p>

<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：過去二十四小時中，斯摩倫斯克以西蘇軍之攻勢業已停頓，大聶伯河套則成爲東綫戰事之重心，蘇軍進攻之區有三，即尼普貝特羅夫斯克區，克里伏洛格以北，及克里曼卓格之南及四南，尤以在第三區內攻勢最爲猛烈。德軍發言人昨稱，東綫戰事與七月五日蘇軍開始進攻時之情形相同，蘇集中戰具及兵力，在某兩點或三點進攻，初有突入德軍防綫者，但一經德預備隊自後方趕到，即堵截陣綫缺口並反攻奪獲少許土地。前斯摩倫斯克之戰已告終了，德第四軍英勇抵抗，不　蘇軍有絲亳之進展，此次大聶怕河套之攻勢，初未出德方所料，但其結果如何目前尙難預測。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：週　東棧之戰事，除大聶伯河套蘇軍之大攻勢及克里米亞之新戰事外，其餘均不甚重要。敵方報告認此等沉寂，與蘇方之更調軍隊有關，此項更調不應予以輕視，亦毋庸予以過度重視。猶憶在已往之兩個冬季中，敵方軍隊多爲受特別　練携特種配備之軍隊，此等冬戰軍隊以滑雪隊，雪撬隊，及冬戰坦克車隊爲主，此外尙有特種騎兵隊，所乘馬匹多係西伯里亞之耐寒戰馬，蘇方或已將此等部隊組成一個或兩個冬戰特別軍，但其兵力當不致超過十二師團。蘇軍當局雖儘量抽調人力，然無論如何其冬戰特別軍決未足接收整個戰綫或甚至戰綫之大部分，故蘇軍當局必至調囘雜色部隊，以凑成所謂冬戰部隊。茲者巳入冬季，德蘇雙方對於冬季之配備及遝輸，均巳籌　及之，但德方之準備則早巳開始，當較爲完善。</p>

<h3 id="c24">敵方總反攻的崩潰　日本大本營　海軍報道課長栗原大佐　陸軍報道課長松村大佐　對談 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>古今陸戰之差別　栗原大佐</p>
<p>聽說松村大佐對於戰史頗有研究，請問第一次歐洲大戰與這次戰爭中陸戰特徵截然不同之點何在？</p>
<p>松村大佐在這次戰爭中，構想全異的新武器，非常之少，以後或許會有種種出現也未可知，但目前多係前次大戰時巳有而現在有了長足進步的武器。即以飛機言，前大戰中時速約二百公里·在今日則爲六百公里七百公里，而且數量也很多·至於戰車的速度，過去爲一小時七·八公里，今日則爲五十公里六十公果。至若重量，現在也有五十　六十噸的大型戰車。所以我想這次戰爭的特微，與共說在於構想已起變化，毋靑謂是在從前的東亞現已有了非常的進步。</p>
<p>再則，前大戰中，以步兵爲主，砲兵，工兵，騎兵等爲從，而這一次，尤其是德蘇戰爭，乃是戰車部隊的戰鬥。此外，飛機亦占重要地位。這次戰爭初期，「　電戰」一詞非常流行，這亦無非說是速度化的意思而巳。昔時步兵以七十五公分的步伐前進，今日則大體上以每小時幾十公里的戰車為戰爭的主體，舊無綫電和優勢的飛機述終。</p>
<p>這次歐洲大戰初期·德國進攻法國，波蘭，皆告成功，即出於速度之賜。對於這種行動敏捷的武器，防禦方法欠充分，我想乃是法波失敗的最大原因。至於今日的德蘇戰，因係戰車對抗戰車，所以野戰的主體可說便是戰車和戰車的遭遇戰。</p>
<p>又若戰爭的方法，例如以前讓到殲滅戰，則有坦倫堡之役，瑪蘇爾之戰等等，但其規模與今日的比較，無靑大巫小巫。昔時，各步兵部隊常逐漸包抄敵軍兩翼，或將敵兵逼入沼澤地帶中，加以殲滅·然目前則用戰車突破敵軍前綫，突破成「楔」形，然後擴展楔的兩側，將敵軍包圍起來。波蘭戰後，我曾問德國武官道：「道次的坦倫堡是何處？」他答道：「整個波蘭戰爭便是坦倫堡。」總之·被包圍的兵力常常很衆，想必也是這次戰爭的一大特徵吧。</p>
<p>苒則，說到戰爭的方法，以前大體始終是陣地戰，但這次自從馬奇諾防綫被災破以來，已經不大有陣地戰了，固然，對戰車障碍物和對戰車壕等防禦方法亦巳進步，但對大型戰車和降落　部隊等進攻器具，守方終覺不如。有許多塲合，德蘇戰是稱陸戰的模範。以戰車爲主體的機械化部隊遭週戰，以及大空軍在其上紛紛散落如火花的景况，洵屬陸戰奇觀。然則，海戰如何呢？</p>
<p>海上夜戰今異於昔　栗原大佐</p>
<p>所謂海戰，常是所謂制海權的爭奮戰。扮演爭奪制海權的主角者，就是戰艦，是以迄今講到海軍力時，總以戰艦爲基準，聲稱擁有　艦幾萬噸，幾十萬噸。然在今日的戰爭中，飛機也發擇非常的威力，這在陸上戰鬥想必也是如此吧。在海上戰鬥中，也以飛機爲中核。這樣說來，所謂「制海權」三字，不是應該修正了嗎？我想應該改稱「制空權下的海上決戰」。</p>
<p>提取制空權者常具九分勝利的把握，點我這想是和前次大戰逈然不同的地方。</p>
<p>此外，海上戰尙有一種非常的變革，便是現在出了一種稱爲電波探知機的新武器，這是非當革新的變革，尤其如日本這種慣於夜戰的海軍，對它尤多期望。由於電波探知器的出現，夜　的方法也大起變化。我想這也和前次大戰不同之點。</p>
<p>祇有潛水艇，今日仍無異於第一次歐洲大戰時。目前，潛水艇依然是很難對付的，像日本這樣的國家，不問從作戰或從生產戰方面年，都很依靠船舶，所以潛水艇尤其討　。</p>
<p>現在戰爭已　堅兩年，且漸入決戰階段，所以我想此際應使國民清楚認　現狀，大家都拿出最後的力量來才行。因此，迄仿的狀况如何？現狀如何？都須使國民明白知道。關於迄今的狀况，怎樣才可使國民易於理解呢？</p>
<p>自存自衞之戰　松村大佐</p>
<p>日本二年前爲自存自衛而崛起時，美英以爲日本是易與的。固然，日本是東海的島國，既缺石油，亦無棣膠，簡直沒有可稱爲資源的東四，戰爭物質確實缺乏，可是一旦崛起於東亞一隅，同時即有珍珠灣大捷，馬來上陸，以及佔領馬來，爪哇，緬甸，將美英逐出大東亞，並進攻新幾內亞，所羅門和西南太平洋。於是日本從南方取得石油，橡膠典錫，獲得種種資源。距開戰不到半載，我們便確立了戰事物資的自給圖。</p>
<p>而且，防衛圈也從日本本土推出四，五千公里，印度，澳洲都在指顧之間，完成必勝不敗的勢態。此即戰爭第一期。</p>
<p>戰爭的第二期是美國反攻期。他們自從被日本　起時打敗以來，就盡全力大事擴充飛機，船舶據馬歇爾宣稱，業巳動員千百萬人員，學生的百分之八十已成飛行兵，這樣拚命充實力量。自去夏以來，即高喊反攻，從南部所羅門而中部所羅門，前月初以還，更反攻所羅門羣島北部的波根維爾，前幾日又反攻吉爾伯特。最近海軍在波根維爾和吉爾伯特建下　勳·國民憂鬱的心理亦頓然一爽，實在感激之至，第三期即在攔截敵方反攻，推它囘去，更進而痛堅敵人。栗原大佐，現在請你講一講國民的心情。</p>
<p>栗原大佐</p>
<p>我們希望國民想到這種事情。要之，正如你剛才所說，第一個階段是日本取得了自存上必要的區域。因此，國民頗有因爲自存的作戰既巳成功，戰爭亦祇要隨便一來就可戰勝了。實際上，即使沒有如此輕易樂觀，但是，不也以爲戰爭大體已完成了卞之八，九了嗎？這是可憂的。這樣的思想是要不得的。我們應該切記這祇是確立了能夠自存的自給經濟圖。幸而完成了這個自給經濟圈·戰爭才可以一直打下去。由此，我們才可從事第二階段的戰爭。這個自給經濟圈對於日本乃是最小限制的束四。它就是你方才所說的確立不敗勢態的好形勢。</p>
<p>可是英美深知長此以往，日本的力量將與時俱增，所以無論如何想曾它囘去，因而遂有最近的反攻之舉。日本的戰爭目的完全是自存自衛，所以第一階段是自存，今後的戰爭則係自衛之戰。因爲他們要反攻，所以我們非隨地實行所謂自衛戰，加以攔截，這是我們希望訴諸國民的。</p>
<p>國民應有的心理　松村大佐</p>
<p>第一期終了後，戰爭按步就班進行，雖有不少驚人戰績，但英美是世界大國，當然不能一時簡單解決。至於今日的反攻，日本當然早巳料到，不足為奇。</p>

<p>我也這樣想。以前的戰爭和這次的戰爭，總之是各不相同的。在過去的戰爭中，陸海軍彷彿是選手，國民則是排出選手的旁觀者，看到自己所捧的選手勝了時，則狂喜大樂，如果被人家吃　，則垂頭喪氣了事。可是，近代戰的本質決不如此，望國民三思此點。</p>
<p>因爲久無大捷，正在懷疑國民的士氣·幸而最近在所羅門，新幾內亞方面或吉爾伯特方面又打了大勝仗。可是，此際我們應該絕對小心，不許有看見所摔「相找」選手佔上風時那種浮囂的樂觀氣分。（吉：譯自十二月三日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>中央社訉　大東亞戰爭勃發以來，忽已三週年，在此期間內，賴盟邦陸海空軍將士之奮勇力戰迭次予敵重創茲已奠定必勝不敗之基礎，日駐華艦隊報道部長特於七日發表談話、說明斷平作戰到底之決心，並預料戰局益將激烈，希望後方民衆，各自完成其所負之戰鬥責任，貫澈始終，茲誌其談話內容如次：</p>
<p>見敵必殺將士猛門</p>
<p>聖戰二週年紀念日茲已來臨，目今囘顧去秋敵軍開始反抗以來，太平洋方面戰局之進展，與世界情勢之變化，並環頓目前戰局，吾人誠覺感慨無量，敵軍企圖自所羅門方面突破我方之一習，而截斷南方共榮圈與我本國之連擊，於是遂展開所羅門方面之激鬥，十月下旬以來，波根維爾島方面，展開戰鬥六次，賴我　敵必殺將士之猛鬥計擊沉擊毀敵方艦船九十四艘擊落敵機五百九十二架，遂使美海軍當局亦不得不承認其所受損害之重大，敵爲圖挽頹勢起見，乃計謀在吉爾巴特方面展開攻勢，截至目前止，並已擊沉擊毀其艦船二十六艘，擊落飛機一四五架，敵焦躁之餘乃早自爆自棄形態，不惜集中多數艦艇飛機，及犧牲莫大生命，企圖在該方面展開一人決門，故預料第二次以後該方面之戰門，必將日見激烈。</p>
<p>必勝態勢日見鞏固</p>
<p>敵除此項主要攻擊外，並為呼應圖謀寺制起見，尙有所謂緬甸反攻及中國大陸方面之空襲，更有北方方面之寺動及潛水艇之通商破　戰，一方面並運用其自爲得意之宣傳思想戰，反　　行會談，及使用重量炸彈，並揑造種種有利戰況等，企圖助長其威勞，觀於敵主腦部之倏忽往返各地，可知其內情之迫切、又觀於敵反攻之不重視戰唎戰術，可知其焦　之深刻，反觀兩方則不論局部戰况如何，必勝不敗態勢，唯　日臻强固，敵方愈接近我戰略之中檢其損害愈見重大，吾人在未獲得最後勝利之前，決不罷手，凡生產力之劃期的增强，輸送力之强化，人物雙方戰鬥力之急速擴充，以及發揚獨思想戰攻勢之成果等，均為我後方人民所應負之戰門責任，我人所有之生活及行動，不論其所在如何，吾人之身邊，均藏有激烈之戰門，此次戰門，實為世界有史以來所未有之激門，為貫澈人類正義之門爭，亦為物資力與精神力之戰門，個人主義與獻身殉國之戰鬥祖先先之血巳與吾人之血融成「片，殉國英　護佑吾人之前途，吾人唯有斷乎殲滅敵人，斷不罷手。</p>
<h3 id="c27">日海軍武官長　發表談話 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>際茲大東亞戰爭二周年紀念日，仗天皇龍威，皇軍赫赫武威，已蔽大東亞，並隨處擊滅英美猛烈反攻，而大東亞民族之決戰性團結，亦益趨勢固，大建設之巨步正着着邁進、此事誠堪慶賀。</p>
<p>中國方面艦隊，此間亦於陸軍精銳部隊密切協力下，作戰處設，雙管齊下，　負大東亞戰爭之偉大責任，全體將士，日夜奪　，努力完遂使命，而同盟條約成立後，日華協力，則期增進，正向完全實現同生共死之途，確信今後從遇任何難局，亦得達成為此民族解放聖戰之中堅，木　之勞譽及任務。</p>
<p>惟敵雖幾　慘敗，仍高爾夫擊　為猛列之反抗戰，固易推察，而彼等擬以檀長之會　等，混瞟當前難局，更逞其思想的銳鋒，亦係意中事。於憬悟戰爭第三年係眞正決戰年之秋，我等各就本位努力奉公之覺悟，固屬自明之理，無須多言。</p>
<p>此時此日，正為我等顯揚祖宗偉業，一死報國，扶翼縮縮皇運之秋，我等一切生活，一切行動，指應請此一誠。</p>
<p>並望當地官民，益知奮開，以共同完遂聖戰自誓。</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席船建辰一鄭氏致開會詞，略謂：「前年十一月二十六日敵美向日本從出之最後通牒，諸君均能深切詳知，常時日本處此環境下，殊爲忍無可忍，如當初日本予以接受，則今日之局面，將淪爲被美國所支持，故東亞各國，在此環境之下，將爲不堪設懇，以是日本迫不得巳，乃於是年十二月八日，發動戰爭，當大東亞戰爭揭開序幕，幸日空軍所向無敵，足跡所至，莫不大獲勝利，故在間戰之初，將英美整個勢力擊破　淸，在今日之東亞，英美勢力已無存在，諒諸君在報上洞悉無遺，而英美方面，爲挽回以往之失，處心積慮，謀反攻之企圖，不論在南北太平洋方面，均爲彼輩企圖之目標。余本人特在此希望諸君之攷慮，如敵英美之企圖反攻，一日獲得成功，彼輩惡勢力，重進大東亞共榮圈，則大東亞之面目及情形，又將爲如何之狀態，希望諸君應以全力總攻，擊滅英美，使彼無法進犯。英美之野心使略東亞，無時無刻，不在謀死灰復燃之想，故我人堅定信念，努力向前。此次戰爭非短期可能結果，說不定延長五年十年，我日本方面，上下早具決將英美擊滅，及實現最後勝利之決心，故定獲勝利之把握，是以希望各位整個東亞十億民族，均應抱一貫之決心，此次戰爭必須達到勝利，則東亞民族共存共榮，並希有錢出錢，有力出力，上下一心，祈求大東亞　爭之勝利云云。</p>
<p>松島報吿</p>
<p>艦隊報道部長松島大佐報告戰况，謂值茲大東亞戰爭二週年日，日軍獲得重大勝利，且將敵方之猛烈反攻，予以擊滅，完全粉碎敵之企圖，決戰之中心，在南太平洋，自十月下旬，波根維爾海面前後發生六次大海戰擊滅敵戰艦九十艘，擊落敵飛機五百架，是以敵受慘大重創。且敵在最後吉爾貝特島及　金島，曾有數次反攻，並再擊滅彼艦艇三十艘，飛俄一百餘架，故敵方之艦隊巾，其戰艦，航空母艦及重要艦船與優秀士兵六七萬名，在此反攻中盡折，可知其反攻戰力之龐大，而彼所得之影響亦頗大。嗣後我方又將戰綫移至內綫作戰，予以個別擊破。致敵損失頗厲。至在北方海面，敵軍準備以空軍反攻，無時不在處心積慮，等候機會，我方特嚴密防備，好在因氣候關係，敵未發動如何之反攻，無論在南方北方之海面，敵空軍僅作些微之奮動，無大攻勞，而在緬甸亦未開始反攻之舉，我方陸海航空部隊先驅部隊，前先加以攻擊，使敵一　　振。綜之在太平洋及印度洋二方，吾方已確立必勝，而敵方巳無挽囘餘地，隨時莫不被吾方攻擊，故大東亞戰爭之完遂，祈望即臨，希望諸君，即相互打成一片，及加强民間決意，同心協力，完成大東亞勝利，故亞細亞民族解放之期，巳告確立。</p>
<p>出淵報吿</p>
<p>大陸軍報道部出淵部長報吿戰况謂：在大東亞戰爭之初，英美兩國巳告大敗『彼輩因見長期戰爭，徒作消耗，變更戰策將龐大實力作孤注一擲之企圖反攻。是以此項向日總反攻之舉，不但在甫方海面，且利用緬甸及渝方之大陸，以驅使渝軍向日反攻，及策動在渝美空軍，謀向日本上空襲，而渝方竟自願倒行逆施，甘爲大東亞之叛徒，期夢想英美之獲取勝利，以地區甘願給英美假用，在渝方大陸作戰之現階段上，彼輩內部複雜分岐，而日軍之行動、巳暗示蒞臨明白之決意信心，有非常迅速之決戰，自十一月二日起，日軍在長江上游湘西一帶，經一月之時間，在每一區將渝方中央軍十萬人、完全撲滅，巳使不能轉機，而十二月三日完全佔領渝第六戰區常德，　常德素爲渝方重視，與長沙爲同樣之中心點，向爲培養抗戰力之據點，是以此次作戰，渝方死傷一萬數午餘兵，而我方士兵，僅五百五十名，渝方死傷之多，於此足見當時抗抵之激烈，而在渝美空軍之驚動，早爲先發制人，粉碎彼輩企圖空襲日本土之夢想，且更謀圖奪取渝方之控制，最近並成立美渝混合空軍，以渝方此次與日軍在長江上游作戰，美渝空軍參與活動，被擊落十四架之多，故渝美空軍在大陸作戰，亳無效果，我人今觀以往日在華派遣軍之戰果，主要作戰計凡三十九次，交戰二萬二千次以上，兵力出動三百三十萬，而敵戰死達廿一萬，俘滹十七萬之多，再述美在渝空軍之損失，擊落二百五十一架，除其中八架外，盡為美在渝空軍所有，於此足見美空軍在渝之實力微薄，此外在緬甸戰綫方面，渝方躁急，謀打開漢甸接濟路綫，而美亦用心該綫，企圖確保，並加强充實美在渝空軍實力，謀向日本之攻擊新路綫，而英國方面，亦謀奮囘緬甸，保持印度，不但利用緬甸之經濟等方面，且更以壓迫印度，雖然彼　目標立塲不同，而器動則為相同，另一方面，在雲南地境，渝軍有企圖進攻之舉，於上月日軍加以攻擊，在怒江西岸將渝軍予以包圍消滅，而英印軍未於援助，故在滇緬經富有活動之日軍開始攻擊後，英美渝更焦躁不安，在華南日軍早巳準備攻渝內地之戰力，在渝戰綫上，不久即可明瞭，綜上所述，爲渝方戰綫爲中心之概况，附帶的關於北邊防衛染固堅强，希望諸君抱定決心一貫努力，以確信明朋東亞之日，不久即可　臨，憑此決心，向前努力邁進。</p>

<p>中央社訉　上海大東亞民族代表懇談會後在滬大東亞各民族中國日本滿洲菲律賓印度五國代表發表共同宣言，原文如下：自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，瞬屆二週年，存有侵略，奴役大東亞野心之英美勢力，轉眼即將潰滅，大東亞民族必勝姿態，早經確立，大東亞共榮圖之基礎，亦已奠定，而大東亞建設之大業，正在邁進中，如中日締結新盟約，緬甸，菲律賓相繼獨立，自由印度臨時政府，亦亦經樹立。復於今年十一月初旬，大東亞各國，在東京舉行大東亞會議，發表大東亞宣言，從此東亞各國均得其所，相扶相助、萬邦同享共榮之樂，是則確立世界和平之根本要義？早經在火東亞共同宣言中，明白表示，大柬亞戰爭之目的，亦即在此。方今亞洲十億民衆，囘復其本來之性格，基於東方道義，而向大東亞建設集合驚起，此皆由於日本海陸軍，以及大東亞各國國軍，超越死生，艱苦奮鬥之所賜也。方今在南洋一帶，正展開劇烈之戰鬥早爲世人所共如之事實，凡我東亞民族應如何感駑，我等謹以一片至誠，對於前綫將兵，致滿腔之敬意。同時對於爲護國礎石，建國棟樑之英靈致表深軍之弔意。我等居於上海之大東亞民族代表，際茲大東亞戰爭二週年，開會紀念之時，應知如無大東亞戰爭之完成，則亦難期共存共榮，並文化之復興，故應覺悟，此是我等應負之天職。茲以大東亞共同宣言爲基幹，排除萬難，實現大東亞民族之協力結合態勢，及實施必要之實行手段以使大東亞民族完全擊滅英美，而完成大東亞之戰爭，誓挺身輔翼，建設大東亞新秩序之大業，諾宣言如上。民國三十二年十二月七日。</p>
<h3 id="c36">我國陳彬氏發言　大東亞戰爭第三年課題 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>吾國代表本報社陳社長彬　發言原詞：</p>
<p>兩年前的上海，東亞各民族間沒有可能集首一堂，談談東亞的大問題，自從大東亞戰爭爆發以後，盟邦日本首先神地獲得光輝的緖戰，接着又是赫赫的戰　，直到最近大東亞會議發表了謀求大東亞共存共榮，獨立親和，發揚文化，繁榮經濟，進而把這種信念　獻於全世界的空前大憲章，我們今天才測在此座談，由東來各民族忙表自由發表意見，共同商討東亞本身的問題，這是在東亞歷史上甚至世界史上最光榮的一頁</p>
<p>由於盟邦日本領導駑門的結果，亞洲人的亞洲理想，今日已經大部份實現，所以大東亞共榮園的外形，事實上已達到最高理想的境地，今後的課題，憲集中在共榮　內，　的如何鞏固，王於如何鞏固內賀，當非日本單獨力量所測負荷，每個民族各有其責任。</p>
<p>第一，今後共榮園內每個民族應站在義務同等的地位，對於鞏固共榮圈，期各自貢獻其力量，俾有名符其實的協力。</p>
<p>第二，各民族對於自身的弱點，應　無隱諱的開誠披瀝，且能勇於革新，因為加强本身的力量，就是加强大東亞共榮圈的力量，同時减低本身的力量，亦就是削弱大東亞共榮圈的力量。</p>
<p>現在進入大東亞戰爭的第三年，我中華民族當前應努力的課題有四：</p>
<p>第一，大東亞戰爭原是「我不滅敵敵必滅我」的戰爭，東亞興亡固在此一戰，而中國興亡，亦在此一戰，這是一個基本的認識。</p>
<p>第二，共同爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，是我們一問，我們對於戰爭的情緒但是現在還不遲，正好舉一切的一切協力戰爭，戰爭並不僅限於前綫的戰門，為政治經濟技術科學以及思想精神，都在戰鬥之列，應以絕對的信念，協力戰爭，然後才測　得必勝。</p>
<p>第三，前綫對於後方的要求，是對人對物最切實的東西，而不是僅口頭筆頭的協力。</p>
<p>第四，在全中國境域內，今日還有重慶政權的分裂　共產黨的陰謀破壞，那未今後應如何革新政治，安定民生，俾全國人民趨於一致，協力大東亞戰爭，這一重大責任，完全在於南京國民政府與和平區人民的眉上了。</p>
<h3 id="c37">我國劉仰山氏發言　大東亞戰爭與東亞民族解放 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>國代表東亞聯盟中國總會上海分會　書記長仰山發言，　爲「大東亞戰爭與東亞民族之解放，」原　如下：</p>
<p>諸位先生：今天水人得參與這個座談會，並有機會說幾句話，是非常榮幸的，今天的座談會，以參加　所屬的國別而論，是帶國際性的，以共同的使命與融和的精神而論，也可以說是一個大家庭間的兄弟的座談會，我們在大東亞戰爭二週年將臨之前夕，舉行這個座談會，其意義之重大可知。</p>
<p>本人今天的　題是「大東亞戰爭與東亞民族之解放」，當大東亞戰爭開始的時候，一般認識不正確者，總以爲這僅是日本對於英美侵略之抵抗，現在大家已經明白這是東亞民族解放的戰爭了，我們要解放東亞，非將侵略東亞的英美帝國主義者打倒不可，祗有在英美努力崩潰之後，世界才能安定，東亞民族解放的事業才能順利完成，這一次戰爭眞是大東亞民族生死存亡的戰爭。」</p>
<p>當大東亞戰爭發生以前，近數十年來所謂「遠東問題，」無非是英美帝國主義者如何宰割柬亞殖民地的，分減問題，東亞因物質的豐富，興氣候的適宜，所謂得天獨厚，也正國為這樣，東亞便成為歐美拓植殖民地的目標，近百年來眞是受盡了帝國主義者的侵略與蹂躪，尤其自一九一四年第一次世界大戰之後，英美帝國主義者更明目張膽，所有參加歐戰之損失，統想由東亞諸弱小民族的身上，樣取得來，以求補償。」</p>
<p>當時英美帝國主義者，爲了爭奪東亞殖民地，未曾沒有多次的衝突，但是在保持白稱人共同的優越地位，以及消滅東亞民族的反抗運動上，所採取的態度是一致的，舉凡英美功利主義所團結之陣綫，均以誘致中日衝突，完遂其「各個擊破」，「分別統制」為目的，這種痛心的事實，眞不勝枚舉，最後復聯結所謂ABCD陣綫，加東亞以更大的包圍威脅，其用心之毒，簡直思置東亞民族於尤刦不復之地位。」</p>
<p>但是東亞民族，是全世界開化最早最優秀的民族，是不曾永遠被蹂躪被征服，而終於共同發出東亞解放的呼聲，解放的行動了，如日本之明冶維新，是東亞民族擺脫帝國主義桎梏的首先發難者，我們國父提倡大亞洲主義，實為東亞民族共求解放，井同建設之最正確的方針。」</p>
<p>可是不幸得很，除盟邦日本自明冶雜新之發　圖强，僅得解脫帝國主義的　手外，可惜東亞同胞，大多數沒有認清大亞洲主義眞義之所在，反為英美侵略者所煽動，竟至　出了兄弟　墻之爭，致使大東亞民族的解放，遭遇了極大的障碍。</p>
<p>幸而中日　明之士，看破了　美帝國主義的陰謀，挺身而出，倡導和平運動，二十七年我領袖汪主席於日本近衞總理大臣聲明之後，發表艷電，　整兩國邦交，外則　鄰以求緊密合作，內外則安定民生以恢復國力，迨至本年一月九日，國府對英美宣占，這種切實分　責任，同甘共苦同生共死的精神，無疑的中國自認在大東亞戰爭中是一位有力的伙伴了（轉入第四版）</p>

<h3 id="c38">再論物價 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>我們許久不談物價問題了、良以本年八月初政府公佈收買棉紗布以還，繼以各主管當局先後採取大九闊斧姿態，從嚴懲究投機市儈，各業囤積商人飲跡之餘，更慮囤貨之遭受收買，紛紛從事出籠，因之各種物價，普通瀉落，迄乎上月底爲止，稱復橫轉下游，但自本月開始以來，由收買棉紗布而引起之銀根堅勢，巳趨鬆弛，而最近投機者流，復又假借節約電流生產減少的理由，從巾施其活動的技倆，以致兩週以來，百物售價，又覺面目全非，其中尤以燃料，如烟白煤斤，煤球，木柴，木炭，以及以紗爲原料之一切棉織品的漲勢爲最驚人；此外，非主要物品，如紙烟，洋燭，皮鞋之類，以及其他並不直接影響民生之物品，亦均直綫上漲，有足以間接刺激其他物價之潛勢。</p>
<p>物價上漲的最主要，也是最淺顯的原因，當然由於貨幣的貶値，與貨物之求過於供，而抑平物價之焦點，固在於增加生產與疏通運銷，可是，從通貨金融方面來限制物價之被擾亂，換句話說，統是限制不正當之放款，抑制社會上浮動的購買力，終不失爲釜底抽薪的一個物價政策，因爲社會間的囤積居奇，以至奢靡成習，大半都是出於浮動的購買力。</p>

<p>國邦日本在中國被告參戰以後，從交還租界至簽訂中日同　條約，援助緬甸及菲律賓先後獨立，印度成立臨時政府，最近並舉行太東亞會議，發表大東亞宣言，這可證明盟邦在完　大東亞戰爭，以求東亞民族解放的積極性</p>
<p>綜觀時勢的演進，大東亞戰爭的爆發，是很自然的發展，隨着大東亞戰爭的東亞民族的解放，乃是自然的結果，亦唯有高呼民族解放，才能夠把東亞各民族喚醒起來，團結起來。</p>
<p>所以我們必須認淸現實，東亞是不容征服的，東亞各國的主權領土，是獨立自由的，但在貢獻大東亞戰爭中的力量，必須溶而為一，是不分彼此的，大東亞戰爭是分東亞整個民族興亡而戰，大東亞戰爭獲勝，大東亞各民族可獲得自由解放，否則必同歸於盡，我們以一個國家而言，東亞各國各有其　然的特質，在大東亞戰爭而言，東亞各民族應同心協力，以達到共存共榮的目的，我們東亞民族求　存的大道，就祇有在這一條路上前進，沒有別的路可走。</p>
<p>英美帝國主義者，還在企圖利用渝蔣　中國的土地作了替英美打仗的戰塲，驅中國的　　替英美　止印度的獨立，這在　情與事理上都交無理由可分辯，渝蔣如再不覺悟，他的失敗，是早可預料的。</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭二週紀念的前夕，回想過去東亞各民族所受英美壓迫的情形，和前方將士流血　　的精神，我們堅信東亞民族的解放，必可完成，一個民族的忍受痛苦的程度愈大，則戰爭勝利的把握亦愈大，我們東亞民族，有着刻苦耐勞的本性，　　的精神，如能精誠團結，所發揮出的力量，當非任何敵人所能的抵當。</p>
<p>不過最後，我還希望我東亞的同胞們不要把大東亞戰爭看得太容易了，我們在這時期不問近次戰爭到什麽時候結束，我們每個東亞同胞必須各盡其力，盡可能地貢獻一切為大東亞戰爭，同時我們尤須注意的，我開頭曾說過，我們唯有國別，但是在整個東亞而言，我們也可說是大家庭中的兄弟，我們唯有强弱大小之別，但是我們必須要做到情　團結，彼此無間，才能担任這　像大的使命，民族間最容易暴露的缺點，如强者的優越感過盛，常常　示驕傲，瞧不起弱小的民族，弱小者有巴認為能力薄弱，而妄自菲薄，缺少自信力，這些都是精神團結共求解放的障礙，我們必須設法克服與掃除的。</p>
<p>以上所談　無高論，尙希各位指正，末了兄弟　　大東亞戰爭的勝利，與大東亞各民族的解放。</p>

<p>滿葉堯公氏發言　鞏固東亞民族新團結</p>
<p>滿洲國民代表葉總領事堯公發言，原文如次：明天就是大東亞戰爭爆發第二周年紀念日，今天舉行大東亞民族代表懇談會，鄙人得於此機會，以滿洲國協和會代表的資格，參加盛會，聊碠所感，實在是光榮之至。想這擁有十萬萬人口的大東亞共榮圈內的各民族，在過去經過長久的時間，大多數曾在領事以英美為魁首，　慾的各外國帝國主義的侵略政策之下，受過經濟的或政治的壓迫，在那個期間，雖有不少的民族的英雄，好幾次出來舉起解放的旗幟，而從主義的上邊說起來，全不是大乘的，不過限於地方的，團體的而已。在大東亞民族的解放上，還談不到勝利的成功，考其原因，是因為沒有富於指導性，而且能夠實行遠大計劃，領導着民族的中心國家。可是為東亞永遠的安寗，和共榮而設想的太日本帝國，顯示八　一宇的精神，第一是滿洲事亦。第二是中國事變，第三就是大東亞戰爭，可以說東亞史上，未曾見過的革新階段，堅實地進行東亞民族的解放，助成民族國家的獨立，因之才有滿洲國之誕生，中華民國國民政府新政權的樹立，對於泰國的協助，緬甸的完全獨立，以及菲列賓的獨立，再進一步，發展到印度民族解放的偉大事業，這種事實，是吾人所想像不到的光耀世紀的　業，惟有大日本帝國才能使之實現，因此回想到我們滿洲國距今十二年前的事，當時以踴躍而起的三千萬民衆的總意為基礎，仗着大日本帝國絕大的仗義，而創立了獨立的國家，直到今日十二年間，本着民族協和精神，專心不斷的從事於國家建設。客秋我們曾為了第一期基礎建設的十年而祝福，在這個基礎上，進入第二期建設，現在國內經濟產業的發展，已到了令人極為驚訝的地步同時在大東亞共榮圈之一環的地位上軍事方面，負有北邊鎭護的重任，政治方面，推進着協和精神而來　身於這義世界的建設。鄙人想到這十二年，國家建設大業今日的偉容，對於在這期間，日本帝國所盡到的無限仗義援助，只有感激而已。鄙人囘顧到我們國家新的歷史，因而想到繼起我們之後的東亞民族的解放，期望勿使今日日本帝國神聖的意，圖勞而無補，應當以日本帝國為指導國家，互相堅實地去進行，完成大東亞各民族的團結，同時將東亞共榮圈的基礎，鞏固起來，使東亞成為世界聖地之冠冕。現在大東亞戰爭正在酣烈未已，時局的　　，也不是那麽簡單，吾人得要貢獻於日本皇軍戰鬥後方的任務，是東亞各民族必能由日本的盡力，而使東亞民族解放實現，並且要將此新的團結理解，而使之强固起來，這是鄙人所最相信的事。明天就是大東亞戰爭爆發第二周年紀念日，由於這個意義，今天在東亞國際都市的上海，開東亞民族代表懇談會，眞是可喜的事，　此祝禱東亞民族奮鬥成功。</p>
<p>菲魏賢氏發言　新的東亞巳產生</p>
<p>中央社訊　在上海大東亞民族代表懇談會席上之菲律濱代表菲協會魏賢會長發言原文：東亞的各位弟兄們：一年前的今天，各東亞在上海團體代表，曾相會於此時此地，對日本在驅逐英美於東亞之外的初期英勇鬥爭中，所獲得的赫赫戰果，表明他們衷心的欣慰和快樂，在那一個可紀念的盛會中，鄙人也榮幸的列席，那時代祈禱着日本進一步的勝利，那末將來終有一天東亞其他民族，會被從桎梏中拯救出來，會被從英美帝國主義的暴虐下解放出來，那時我身為東亞人，帶着東亞人的榮耀，覺得非常快樂。可是今天呢？我成為菲律賓的國民，懷着菲律賓人的心，我是更加高興了。那不過是最近的事，我們在西方人的統治下，其先是西班牙，其後是美國，呻吟憔悴，現在我們的祖國、終於擺脫枷鎖，獲得獨立了。使我高興的是去年，我們的願望與祈求，竟好像識途老馬似的，載着我們直向勝利之途奔跑，你們看中國已經恢復了她們的主權，菲律賓民衆，已度得甦生，印度也有了她的自由臨時政府，馬來與南洋諸洲，已經恢復了繁榮，所有東亞民族，都是光輝燦爛的浸　在永久自由的目光下，他們有新的希望，有更大的民族自尊心，有甦生的自　與正義感，新的東亞已經產生了。所有這一驚天動地的事蹟，接　日本一再的勝利而次地出現，那是去年今日我們所慶祝的偉大勝利，今天的慶祝大會，其意義，更為重大，我們不但頌揚日本陸海軍的光　戰績，同時更歌頌新東亞前途。</p>
<p>印却得星氏發言　印度旗在新德里升起</p>
<p>中央社訊　上海大東亞民族代表懇談會席上印度代表獨立聯盟上海支部長却得　發言，略謂：二年前日本為解放亞洲，在極短時間，將英美擊敗，在各戰塲香港。馬來·菲律賓·東印度·緬甸，將英美驅出，二百年來英美根據地昭南島，亦已無敵人之踪。果敢無敵之日軍，不怕死之精神，震　世壇。同時我印人最覺歡欣之事，即印度軍隊今後不再受英國人之壓迫，在香港·緬甸駢　與日軍作戰，政治自由獨立之血。本年一月九日，中國國民政府參戰協力大東亞戰爭向英美宣戰。在此一年中，中國除獲得完全自由獨立，並將租界接收，肅淸英美敵人之非法藏垢納汚之所，我人預信總有一日，重慶蔣介石，自知錯入歧途，英美分裂，返歸向亞洲同　携手。日本政府自本年協助緬菲獨立，且在大東亞會議席上，束條首相宣佈，必道參島及尼考白島歸屬印度臨時自由政府，此乃表明日本毫無野心，誠意協助印度之獨立，謀印度之解放。本年六月，我江特拉鮑斯氏，自柏林至東方，為解放印度工作努力，及至昭南，並成立印度國民黨，以「返回新德里」去口號與日軍駢肩作戰，向東亞共同敵人英美作戰。在本月二十三日，印臨時政府向英美宣戰，我們要流我們的血，擊滅英癥狀，直至我們獲得自由，値茲慶祝大東亞戰爭二週年紀念日，更增加我們的力量，堅强勝利信心，在明年今日，我們二色的印度旗，定能在新德里升　云云。</p>

<p>— 孫鹿龕</p>
<p>中國同盟是成立了，新的平等互惠條約也產生了，兩國民衆，萬目睽睽，所期待的自然是全面和平這一問題。但這問題，要說他難於實現，却是考察民衆心理，除了傳播赤化之共產黨，迷信英美之蔣政權，發國難財之投機家，三種人以外，敢說是沒有一個，不是渴望和平的。身在兵間，遭受種種禍變者，不用說了，便是居住都市的人民，飽書經濟壓迫，物品缺乏，交通梗阻，一切痛苦，誰不抱有　作太平　，不為離亂人的思想，據這種看法，和平早應該實現了，何以待到今日，尙　得的路茫茫，一元把　，我以為希望和平的人儘管多，而信賴和平的人，實在太少。因為信賴和平人太少，以致全面和平，不能實現。今日之下，要全面和平實現，除了中日兩方，就過去現在的誤點，迅速予以糾正，　人民對於和平，發生了堅實信賴心，更沒有第二條路可走了。</p>
<p>就我方說，政府對於民衆，一　的誤點，勿　諱言，實在是有目共睹，第一集會多，議案多，實施少，成績少，第二任用官吏，漫無標準，半徇情面：第三朝令夕改，叫人無所適從，第四沒有民意機關，與情無從上達，第五發覺　　，不　嚴懲過舞弊者。</p>
<p>話說至此，或許有人要駁我說：「渝方之不能加入和平，並非民意的表示，而係蔣政權兵力所刧　，况且還有延安共產政府存在，更是沒有傾向和平希望的。」這類論調，固然不能斥他全無根據，但就實際上說，渝方兵士，也是由人民徵募來的，若果民心全體渙散，兵威從何施展。辛亥革命，精其利器，盡在北方，但是第八鎭工程營中一小隊人　引起尋火綫，不滿四個月，竟推倒了淸政府。北伐那年，吳孫張的兵力，對民軍是七與三之比較，然而民心一去，國民黨竟於短時間收了全功。都是不遠的事實，足為殷鑒。就渝方內容說，除却宋孔一流，對英美私人經濟關係過深，設法擺脫。其他則軍事要人何敬之，對抗戰就勉强得很，楊耿光曾說過，我們統帥的軍事學識，夠不夠得上做人家的旅團長，尙是個問題。渝方高等將校的心理，即此可以想見。桂系的力量，早已削弱到所餘無幾，川系則多半是騎兩頭馬的，並且鑒於劉輔臣之死，多數都有點寒心。　系首領龍子舟，對蔣之貌合神離，久巳達到頂點，只要現政府眞有辦法，盟邦對他有極度開誠工人黨變化，或許蔣介石只好出國去做逃亡政府，至於共黨的整個團體，是不會參加和平的，但也無妨，因為我國國體民俗，原沒有接受共產的理由，向使國民政府成立時，眞能剷除北洋餘毒，與民更始，確立廉正剛明的體制，實踐三民主義，共產黨早已不能存在了，惜乎當日除了提高黨權之外，其他一樣未曾辦到，他們借為口實，自然便於煽惑羣衆，只要政府取鑒前車，力振將來，取得民衆信仰，渝方縱有英美攀腰，經必瓦解，共黨更不難根除，至遲一兩年間，全面和平，必然實現的。</p>
<p>就友邦方面說，在其政府與國民的心理，當然希望我國早現全面和平，以便團結一致來對付英美，我如今提出三點，似乎都有檢討的必要，其一照盟邦政府對我之種種表示，可算得仁至義盡，無微弗至，然而就目下和平區域內眞實情况看來，是否處處件件，都與日政府所發表的文吿符合，互助提携的精神，共二盟邦軍政官廳，或因人少事繁，或因語言　　，　　　用華員中良　不齊，或許可說莠多於良，此曹倚仗通解日語，接近當局不免借勢凌人，甚至舞弊詐財，不時發生，金錢盡歸若　，民怨則積於盟邦，近來憲兵隊偵獲之詐財案，竟數至二十萬，可見友軍早巳覺察，但惜類似此等事項，尙屬不少，尤其以假借公共事業，舞弊害衆的事為多，憑良心說，盟邦人士，多數是能夠自　的，但希望少用浮華巧滑的僱員，並且對此輩行為，平日要加以密切之注意：更抱定有犯必懲，有懲必嚴的宗旨，自然良民受福，和平實現，倍有指望。其三外人來華，與社會接觸最密的，無疑要算商家為第一了，商家對居民，能眞實表示親善，一人傳十，十人傳百，影響又捷又大，現下我也提出三點意見：切望盟邦商家，加以檢討：（甲）各大商家如銀行公司，其組織內容大都是西洋化的，執事人員，多通英語，懂華語者，反居次位，已經略有隔閡，加之英美商行，往日對待華人，是傲慢的，似乎目下盟邦的商行尙未克盡改此習，看華人反較西洋人為輕，這類情形，當然不是家家如此，但願有則改正之一。（乙）雙方聯合組織，事業往往除了人事庶務之外，華方竟無一實權，儼然從前洋行僱用買辦的體制，試問眞正擁鉅資，當才識之商人，那個願意就這範圍，此是希望改正之二。（丙）初到中國營運的商家，大半因入地生疏，或語文膈膜，招致華人合夥，以利進行，但是殷實良善的民衆，有膽小不敢加入的，有誤信謠傳，而無意投資的，於是一班流氓騙子，乘機而起，一面假夥方為　　，而欺詐同胞，一面趁夥友之不悉華俗而無弊不作，等到倒帳或虧資之日，民衆却歸怨日商，風明此類事，在北方是見不一見的，以後似乎應當加意愼始，方能全終，此是希望改正之三，上三者看似細故，却最易引起社會惡感，也屬全部和平一大障礙，深望盟邦商友，特別留意。</p>
<h3 id="c47">全面和平的曙光 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 胡碩美</p>
<p>全面和平的聲浪，久已高徹雲霄，而實施全面和平的工作，亦早　之已熟，日在努力進行中；在國民政府的立塲，　與盟邦日本協力，向擊成英美之　邁進，自當貢獻一切，使用最高度的能力，決計不能任命重慶政權存在，而且，和平運動發生到現階段，獲得這樣合於正義的條約，抗戰的對象，巳全部消失，絕無盲目拖延的理由，國人平日以撤兵為和平的要求，現在我們盟邦日本，不但允許撤兵，即辛丑條約中的駐兵權，亦完全放棄，全面和平的關鰱，全在重慶，只要重慶放棄抗戰，全面和平就可以實現。</p>
<p>重慶方面，曾一再公開的說：「必須囘復到事變以前狀態，方能實現和平」，以目前的現狀論，此次中日同盟條約的內容說：不僅囘復到此次事跡以前的狀態，實在巳超過了若干倍，那末，抗戰論者的根據又何在呢？</p>
<p>不過，全面和平之所以至今還不能夠實現？由於淪蔣的暴力刦持，以及共產黨的從中作梗，固然是一個原因，而國民政府現下的力量，尙未能普遍發展，這也是一個重大原因。還都以來，</p>
<p>但是人民也可以為自身的存亡，家國的安危而激怒起來的。自從蘆溝橋事跡乃至對英美宣戰，中國政府莫不在求中華民國之獨立，中國人民莫不在爭國家民族之生存。中國若無七七蘆溝橋的和日本開戰，則中國決不能成一獨立國，同樣地，中國若無一月九日的和英美定點，即中國更將永不能成為一獨立國家，並且，豈祇關係中國的在望，蘆溝橋事跡和大東亞聖戰還是亞洲解放的基礎。</p>
<p>這說怎麽講呢？俗語說得好「不相打不成交」，七年之前，中日二國的關係，　　的地方實在很多，中國若不毅然與日本抵抗，　恐怕中日間的關係決不會有　今日一樣互相深切地了解的一日。目覩着同文　種的二國人民，搏　於水深火熱之中，摧毀着二國的國力，有識之士，早就感然　之，而就是這樣的在可惜之中，二國人民漸漸地悟到了自相殘殺之非，於是才有近衛的聲明，汪主席的艷電，課會漸釋，而眞實的道義的友誼之花便結出了此次中日同盟條約的果來了。所以說蘆溝橋的抗戰實在是中日互相瞭解的　介物。現在中日二國旣本道義的精神互相提　，那末昔日的敵巳變為今日的友了，而重慶政府為何還不醒悟呢？</p>
<p>凡是危害中國之獨立自由的就是中國之敵國，日本從前是敵國，但現在已是盟邦了。重慶政府何嘗不知道英美的為害中國，但所以仍依着附而與日本作戰，就是他們仍以為日本是中國第一大敵，這個觀念不能打破，全面和平也就不能實現。</p>
<p>以事實言，日本尊重中國之獨立平等亦較英美為甚，試看此番所訂之中日同盟條約，其意義何等深遠，而英美僅東施效顰，交還租界撤廢領事裁判權等，其可笑猶如美國於菲列賓獨立之後，再詭言哄菲人以獨立，其虛偽　飾，雖三尺孩童，也不為騙也。</p>
<p>但是重慶政府之不　醒悟，以吾人之目光視之，當有二種原因：</p>
<p>為英美所逼，不能反身。</p>
<p>對日本不能信任，對東亞的建設缺乏雄心。</p>
<p>此二種原因尤以後者為主，所以若要重慶翩然歸來，唯有以事實證明日本對中國之平等相視，而此事則又可分二方面言。</p>
<p>中國人民對於日本之仇視歷年以來，巳在中國人民心中種下觀念，此等仇視的偏見唯有靠宣傳之力。來鼓吹中日間的友愛。同時友邦也應一改以往之態度，使中日二國漸漸走上眞正尊重了解乃至相愛之路。</p>
<p>政治方面，日本應幫助中國成為一眞正强有力的獨立國家。中國一日不强，東亞一日不能稱為完全的解放，這是顯而易見的。</p>

<p>日本海軍的傳統精神，成就了世界海　史上空前的戰績。這種精神，不論是敵是友，無不欽仰的。日本名作家岩田豐雄傾其全力為朝日新聞社寫「海軍」一書，將日本海軍傳統精神，曲曲傳出。曾逐日披露該報，傳誦一時，並攝成電影。茲由本報迻譯，逐日刋載，敬希讀者注意。</p>
<p>男兒</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>大正八年，凡爾賽和約成立，巴　的市民，從所有的窗子中，撕碎了紙片拋下來，象徵着勝利的瑞雪。他們的感覺，與其說是勝利的欣喜，不如說迎接和平的到來。是年十一月十八日，鹿兒島市下、荒田町的食米商谷眞吉方，生下一個男孩。</p>
<p>在面臨着谷山街道的店面前，拿着簸箕的眞吉，在聽到告訴以前，已因高昻而强烈的產聲，知道這事情了。</p>
<p>「男孩不是嗎？」</p>
<p>五十歲的父親，臉上毫無一點表情。繼續　着　滿米粉的簸箕。</p>
<p>眞吉不像一個商人，是一個沉默寡言的人。有近衛騎兵，上等兵的官銜，日淸·日俄二役，都曾從軍。可是，他聽到了男孩的誕生，只似森林一般的靜寂，那不但為他有這種經歷，和性質，而另有其他的原因。</p>
<p>他，他的妻，對孩子的出生，已慣常了。這一囘生的，是第十一個。五個女的，五個男的，一個也不夭折，健全地成長起來。且，那生產輕易得很。孩子們也似庭內柿子樹結實般，自然地，且單純地，一個一個產生出來。現在　　又　了一個—男的　了。</p>
<p>眞吉就那樣淡淡地，迎受孩子的出生。當地的風氣，雖以多產為恥，也不嫌厭。固然，家境並不十分豐裕，但因有把孩子當作天賜的風俗，所以無論生下了多少，沒有一句話，何况此次還是一個男孩。雖然已經是大正八年的時代了，但在薩摩的地方，兩性之間，價値的懸隔，還很厲害。</p>
<p>（生下了男孩……）</p>
<p>眞吉在想着，怎樣取名。長女叫春子，次女呌滿子—女孩的名字，可以很隨便題下一個。但男孩就很費心思了。長男叫眞藏，次男叫眞一郞—這還容易，後來陸續生出來的，就麻煩了，四男叫四吉，還不錯，五男題名太郞，就稍粗一點了。</p>
<p>此次，無論怎樣，想取吉利一點的名字。為什麽呢？這囘孩子的名字，似乎不能太隨便！</p>
<p>（眞，眞，眞人！好啊！）</p>
<p>奇異地，順口滑出來的好名字，想起來了。眞人，谷眞人！薩摩義士八十三名中有其人，眞是非同小可的名字。那時，眞吉的家，還是平民。</p>

<p>戰中遭遇大敗的英美，覺悟到長期消　　的不利，迅　整個戰時態勢，以龐大的　　雙孤注一擲的反攻。如今南方的　城正在日夜演出　　　　的　戰。</p>
<p>英美的對日總反攻，　　方　城外，並重視緬甸反攻，及從中國大陸的反攻，驅使重慶　底從事對日抗戰，以駐　美空軍，企圖直接空襲日本本土。</p>
<p>重慶亦自行違反東亞的歷史，繼續抗戰，並　　英美聯合團的勝利，逐漸以地盤給　美軍，看望　外力粉碎日本。</p>
<p>如是，中國大陸上作戰的現　　，　　　雜的狀態，同時，大東亞戰爭中中國戰綫的地位，亦愈加重要。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭第二年的一年間，　　軍除其原來任務擊滅　軍以外，對中共軍也　　進行愈積極　　的作戰，並對駐渝美空軍的　動，當在其企圖之先，制其先機，而封閉其呼號的空　日本本土。</p>

<p>甲，交戰次數的二二，〇〇〇次，每月平均一、九〇〇次，一日約六七次，這和前年的二五、〇〇〇比較起來似見减少，但日軍出動次數，則無多大差別，由此可見敵方極力　　交戰。</p>
<p>乙，交點兵力約三、三〇〇、〇〇〇名。比前年的三六〇、〇〇〇為少，這表示敵方兵力補充的困難。</p>
<p>丙，敵方戰死者約二一〇，〇〇〇，俘虜及歸順者約一七〇、〇〇〇，後者對前者約比率為八〇％，這比　和二十九年度的一二％，三〇年的二九％，三一年度的四四％比較起來，這一年間俘虜及歸順有劃時期的增加，這正說明敵軍的戰意是怎樣的低下。</p>
<p>丁，就鹵獲的兵　來看，火砲，重火器等在减少中，這證明　　　絕之後敵方的補充困難，而　　低其　　；而　　　　刀之　的增加，　　　　以不　式的武器　戰。</p>

<p>— 鹽田大尉</p>
<p>緖言</p>
<p>在去年八月，敵方從所羅門方面從　總反攻以前，日本海軍的戰歷，如燎原之火，如下坡之水，堪稱空前。如夏威夷奇　戰，馬來海戰，　　攻略戰，爪哇海戰，新加坡攻略戰，巴里島海戰，斯拉巴　，巴達維亞海戰，印度洋海戰，珊瑚海海戰，　　中途島等，前二役在一開戰即擊滅敵主力艦隊，先使敵戰鬥力减半，又擊沈威爾斯　王號，粉碎敵人在東亞的巨大戰鬥力，後者則把精銳的矛鋒指向敵人的外方戰線，突入敵方根本要地後，陸續集中跳島攻擊，以至去年八月十四日的第一次所羅門海戰，一舉而把戰綫處長至西，南各三千公里以上，在此期間，其擊沈敵戰艦八艘，航空母舡八艘，日文損害，僅航空母艦三艘（內小型航空母艦一，水一飛機母艦一），獲得大　。從戰略上看來，到此時為止，可稱第一期作戰，或可稱為攻擊階段，總之，第一期的日本海軍力所攻擊的最大地點是所羅門。再進一步，為完全遮斷美國澳洲的聯絡，為完全斷絕澳洲夏威夷的交通，必須在南方佈置重要的補充基地。</p>
<p>此後，必然的進入第二階段，保護南方寶庫。增設根據地，佔據各據點以粉碎敵攻擊力的防　　勢。瓜達爾加納爾的決戰，伊羅貝拉，倫伽海戰，第一次至第三次所羅門海戰，南太平洋海戰，均為領帶據點粉碎敵反攻力的海戰。近如第一次至第六次的玻島海空戰，在某種意義上，和所羅門海戰有同樣的性質。</p>
<p>何故獲得大勝</p>
<p>那麽開戰以來的赫赫戰果究從何而來呢？那是由於訓練所造成的必勝信念，及立足於這必勝信念的擊滅敵人之精神。這就是日本海軍的傳統精神。必勝信念不單是室內敎育或紙上談兵所產生的，實由於不斷訓練而來，自信必可以打倒敵人。去年八月八日第一次所羅門海戰中進攻都拉其後數小時後。正在前進時，午後五時十五分，敎練的喇叭一響，水雷戰艦即開始訓練。這訓練每日在同一時刻訓練着，直至今日，所以在進攻都拉其的空暇時，訓練亦同時開始。如此，姑能一發必中，而東鄉元帥的遺訓：「一門一發百中的砲，勝過百門百發一中的砲」，也能實現。</p>
<p>但雖有這種訓練，當戰鬥時，沒有大精神力的推動，不能期其有成果。日本海軍七十年來的傳統精神「不打倒敵人不死」，變成「見敵必殺」的信念，更發展至「求敵必殺」的信念，依此信念，乃產生了以一當十。或以一架當二十架，或向敵艦自炸的勇士。</p>
<p>因華盛頓會議，被强屈於五五三之劣勢的比率，世界建艦運動所注目的新銳虞艦航空母艦，不能不出於改造，自沈之途。自此以後，日本海軍乃傾其全力於兵器的改造，訓練的澈底，及戰術的硏究。日本更注意到將來不能不以三對十的比例和英美對抗，故在兵器的質上下了最大的苦心，其結果，在此次戰中，證明日本的兵器是怎樣的優秀。</p>
<p>其一，日本有特殊潛航艇，在夏威夷，在悉尼，在人　伽斯加爾，使敵會戰　，對於另外許多新銳兵器，亦正在不斷硏究。說到飛機方面，日本海軍戰鬥機的優秀　，即美國方面也早有定評——美國在兵器上素誇為世界第一，但對日本海軍戰鬥機的出現，亦相當感到頭痛。每次海空戰，特別誇示擊　日本海軍機的數字由此可見敵方對日本戰鬥機有想像以上的恐怖。本年八月，敵方報　稱：日本在新幾內亞戰綫使用新戰鬥機，以如澈本國加速製造優秀飛機，一切戰爭，使兵器有驚異的發達，這在前次大戰中已可以明白，尤以現代的飛機，其進步令人驚異。昨日的飛機，在今日的戰鬥中已經落後了，今日的飛機，不能成為明日的第一綫飛機。日本在飛機方面，尤以戰鬥機，其優秀性常走在敵方之前。又將每次獲得戰果的航空戰中，　　沉大型巡洋艦（一萬噸以上），可見魚　也相當發達。</p>
<p>其次，不能不說戰術硏究和統帥部的深謀遠慮之作戰。近如所羅門及吉爾伯　所展開的作戰，使美國軍事評論家以日艦隊的作戰詫為異想天開，如夏威夷奇　戰，新加坡的攻擊，珊瑚海的海戰，日本往往出敵不意，其偉大戰果，在後　的戰術上，留下了偉大的戰歷。又　察二年來海戰的歷史，夏威夷並珊瑚海海戰，對敵方有極大的影響，　使英美變更其　船建艦計劃。</p>
<p>那珊瑚海海戰，中途島海戰，乃日本海軍　肉斬骨的傳統的攻擊精神之表現，又如第一次至第三次的瓜島方面海戰，尤以倫伽海夜戰，日本海軍在攻守二種戰術上均有堅强自信。瓜島的轉進，乃任務完畢後，準備次期作戰而整頓强化內部戰綫，日本統帥部對此轉進作戰的勇斷，實足稱道。</p>
<p>其次，日本海軍兵力，由物的要素及人要素所構成。人的要素可分為士官和下士官兵，下士官兵更可以分為徵兵和志願兵。下士官實為海軍兵力的根本，所獲赫赫戰果，實有　此等下士官，成為士官的手足，得以沈　且正確地進行戰鬥，故能以一敵十或十五，海軍方面為養成此等優秀下士官，曾費了很大的硏究和努力。</p>
<p>吉來戰術，要求天時，地利，人和三者之利，日本海軍的人和，在軍艦上，以艦長為父，副艦長為母，是一家的家族，生死一體，由人和所產生的戰鬥力，乃能以劣勢破數倍之敵。</p>
<p>現代海戰的性質</p>
<p>海軍的戰鬥精神，最重視最初的五分鐘和最後的五分鐘，這是和陸戰不同的海戰的特異性所要求的。至去年八月瓜島的轉進，約半截餘，實為緖戰。即　大東亞共榮圈之武力的勘定之後，確保次期　段的繼續戰鬥之補充來源，日本從基地一一奪取附近敵人的前哨地點，在其速度上，在其戰果上，樹立了空前偉大的金字塔。要之，這初期的目的，乃在確保遂行戰爭的資源，而從另一方面看，日本有利者，正是剝奪英美的遂行戰鬥力，日本在制　制空權下，取得了無限的戰時必要物資如鋁，石油，橡膠，錫，鐵等。有此，日本在任何戰爭生產上，整備了獨力可以取勝的體制，確保了北起菲列濱，南至爪哇，東自西里伯，西　　　一　地方的寶庫。同時，又意義着突入另一戰略階段。</p>
<p>第二階段的防禦戰，就是戰力增强戰。緖戰的結果，不但確保了軍需資源，且在基地上，戰略上，日本亦已確保了必勝不敗的態勢，對敵方的反攻作戰，南方諸羣島担任極偉大的任務。以上軍需資源的，戰略的有利性，當然也就是英美方面的不利條件。另一方面，如把緖戰更解剖起來，日本對英美多年來互相作為假想敵國，不斷硏究，所有兵器戰術，窮其秘術，在緒戰期中，完全發揮出來。就敵方看來，敵方戰前所有主力艦艇，完全沈沒，現在第二階段所使用的各種艦類，均為新型或艦類不詳的軍艦。</p>
<p>又戰前美國採用大艦巨砲主義，以為在廣漠的太平洋上，巨大的艦隊是必要的，但經結戰期，深情至建艦政策的重大錯誤。蓋太平洋中有無數的島。根據一切海上所成立的假定而採用的戰鬥方略，結果，大型戰艦不適用。那島有時比戰艦更有用處。而為不沈的航空母艦。又因為這些島可當作重要的根據地，補充地，美國現在正太懊悔作戰的大錯，他們的制海權制空權已被奪去，從馬來半島至所羅門羣島的大小無數島嶼，現在完全變成日本的不沈航空母艦，成為有力的艦艇，有着內綫作戰的有利態勢。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c53">波根維爾島　海空大戰始末記 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 王志超</p>
<p>十月下旬起開始的波根維爾島大海空戰，截至十二月初止，一個多月中，日本海軍擊沉了美國四艘戰艦，七艘航空母艦，十二艘巡洋艦，十一艘驅逐艦，創立了珍珠灣一役以來最鉅大的戰果。消息傳來，全世界為之震動，現在將其經過情形　述於下：</p>
<p>波根維爾島，是所羅門羣島中最大的島嶼，也是日本南方前綫海軍根據地拉巴（爾新不列顚島上）的屏障，位置在新幾尼亞之東，英屬埃利斯羣島，新　布里底斯羣島之西，澳洲之北，以上各地大都在敵軍手中，以地位來講，受敵方三面包圍中，十分孤立，然而日軍自佔。該地以來，曾用最大的努力，鞏固其防衛戰力，使之成為南方最前綫的一個堅强要　，不　威脅了澳洲，並且以此為根據，阻撓美國對於澳洲的運輸接濟。所以此次美軍不　任何慘烈犧牲，必欲得之甘心，是無足為怪的。</p>
<p>波島南部，有特羅基納河通出海口，出海之處，便叫特羅基納角，河口有個冲　威的山島，便是美　此次拿出的地方。波島南方六十公里有個荒島叫摩諾，可說是波島南方的衛星，美軍在進攻當時，便加以佔據。所謂「波島大海空戰」，就在這兩處附近的海面展開。</p>
<p>在這次戰爭開始以前，美軍自然有充分的準備。過去二年來，美國宣稱建造了十二艘航空母艦，共計五十萬噸。同時根據柏林方面的消息，地中海方面自從意大利的海軍喪失以後，英美將該方面的海軍，計戰艦四至五艘航空母艦三至四艘，重巡洋艦七至八艘，驅逐艦十艘以上，調到東方來對付日本。所以南洋日本海軍在此次波島大戰以前的形勢，就數量上說，並不怎樣　　。</p>
<p>序戰</p>
<p>十月二十日美機空　波島，可說是波島海空戰的棄。來襲的美機，不過二十架，結果被擊落十三架，由此可見此次突襲，力量甚薄，僅負有偵察日方實力的任務。</p>
<p>十月二十二日起，美方正式向波島的日守軍挑戰了。總計廿二日起至廿五日止四日中，美方派了六五二機轟炸波島的最南端布英：廿六日，一次出動了三六〇機來大舉轟炸。</p>
<p>這次突襲，實際上是牽制波島日軍，以掩護其運兵在摩諾島上陸的企圖，次日早上便發現美軍在　諾島登陸了。</p>
<p>摩諾島東西長十二公里，南北　八公里，是個荒島，並無人烟，美軍佔領以後，波島南端的要塞布英受了極大威脅。廿七日晨起日方便派遣海軍機，對上陸地附近的美國艦船，大舉轟炸，結果炸沉小運輸艦一巡洋艦二，大運輸艦一，用魚雷擊沉小運輸艦一，並擊傷大型巡洋艦一，小運輸艦一，攻擊的日機也小有損失。</p>
<p>美軍有摩諾島成立了前哨根據地後，十月底開始了大規模的行動，幾個巨大的運輸船　在　　巨艦保護下，自東南方向波島移動，此種大規模的行動，無論怎樣隱蔽，也難逃日方巡邏機的偵察。美方的攻擊目標有三　：第一處是波島北端對岸的布加島，第二處是波島腰部的特羅基納角，第三處是摩諾島與布英昌之間的　特倫島，自南方來的武裝船　便分着三路推進，三者中以特羅基納角一路為最重要，所以這一路的戰事也特別激烈。</p>
<p>日方在接得報吿後，自十月三十一日深晚起，便出全力迎擊。在摩諾島的東方，波島的西方，出動了大批的轟炸機，魚雷機，戰鬥機，作必死的攻擊，同時駐在拉巴爾港的日本艦隊也揚帆南下，在特羅基納角海面與美國艦隊遭遇，這一場大戰，直殺到十一月二日晨方始完畢，據日方公布的戰績如下：</p>
<p>海軍航空部隊戰績</p>
<p>炸沉　大運輸艦　二艘</p>
<p>擊沉　巡洋艦　一艘　驅逐艦　一艘　登陸舟　四〇以上</p>
<p>擊　　美機　一〇架</p>
<p>擊破　大巡洋艦　一艘　巡洋艦或驅逐艦　一艘　大運輸艦　二艘　小型船艇　多艘</p>
<p>艦隊戰績</p>
<p>炸沉　大巡洋艦　一艘　大驅逐艦　二艘</p>
<p>擊沉　大巡洋艦　二艘　巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦　一艘</p>
<p>擊破　大巡洋艦一至二艘　驅逐艦　二艘</p>
<p>日方也損失驅逐艦一艘·及飛機若干，另有巡洋艦一艘受傷。</p>
<p>在海空大戰的同時，十一月一日美軍便在特羅基納角登陸了，二日又在其北方的哈　登陸，特羅基納角前的小島，自然被佔，美軍損失的慘重，連美國自己也不諱言，據說據守當地的日軍，以　敵衆，在一次白刃戰中，美軍死的便有一千八百人。</p>
<p>首次戰</p>
<p>十一月一日的海空大戰以後，美方一面拚命增援登陸部隊，同時出去了二百幾十架（十一月二日）的飛機，襲擊日海軍的根據地——拉巴爾，另用一百三十五架飛機，襲擊布加島，日方兵來將擋，也用優秀的海軍機與他對抗。拉巴爾方面，日本的陸上高射砲部隊，兵艦，飛機三方擊落的飛機，竟達二百〇一架之多，美國飛機生還者極少，這在空戰史上可說是絕無僅有的。布加方面，也擊落三十九架。</p>
<p>接着十一月五日的「第一次波島空戰」。美方鑑於歷次慘敗的敎訓，採用了所謂「航空母艦集團」的戰法，這次的艦隊，以二艘航空母艦為中心，每艘　以各種艦艇，排成兩個輪形陣，戒備得十分嚴密，此外又有陸上根據地的飛機，飛來助戰，大胆地　入日本航空的威力　，企圖一舉而取得波島戰爭中的制空權，然而這正是日本方面求之不得的。五日晚上，當美國航空母艦集團駛至波島南方海面的時候，日本飛機突然出現，攻擊結果：</p>
<p>炸沉　大型航空母艦一艘</p>
<p>擊沉　中型航空母艦一艘　大巡洋艦　二艘　巡洋艦或驅逐艦二艘</p>
<p>十一月六日以後，　地的戰事仍繼續着，　不列　　方面，類類受到美機的侵襲。日本陸軍航空隊，也表現了卓越的成績。自六日至九日間，日機六次轟炸　　尼　美方　　　，炸　　　　達一百二十架，　　　　　美機也擊落五十九架。</p>
<p>二次戰</p>
<p>十一月八日早晨，日方　　　美　集中特羅基納角的　吿，大量的　　機，轟炸機分批出發，當發現美方集中如此多數　　　一處的時　，日　的飛行員也為之興奮不　，第一批日機的攻擊，只有五分　　　了，美　　　三艘，　　　四　立　　　澈底，另有二隻巡洋艦一隻運輸艦受傷，當攻擊時，美國　　中的戰鬥機飛來攻擊，結果也被擊落十五架。日方戰鬥　指揮官納富大尉，不幸便在此役中　　。</p>
<p>原來日本海軍的戰法，與別國不同，指揮官乘坐的旗艦，在交點時必第一個突入敵陣，海軍航空部隊的作風也是如此。</p>
<p>納富大尉的地位，自然最易受到攻擊。</p>
<p>這時　　漸漸轉惡，後續的日機在電光閃閃中自基地出發，一批批的決死隊，在亂　裏前進，到目的地時已在傍晚，在兩洋下午四時半便日落了，日機在偶然的機會裏，在　　中發現了這艦隊的主力，正以全速力退避。於是一　　發，便冒着高射砲火綱，直衝而下，直衝到美　身傍，才發出　雷，一瞬間平靜的海面便水柱四起。火光熊熊，美戰艦一艘起了大火。二艘巡洋艦立即沉入海中，另有巡洋艦一艘驅逐艦三艘起火。這時第三批雷擊隊接着來了，一番攻擊，四艘起火的戰艦中一　沒入海中，而領導這雷擊隊的野阪大尉也踏着先列的血跡戰死了。綜計此役日方損失了二十架飛機，除兩個大尉外並戰死三個中隊長。反之，取得的代價，自十分重大，可見此役之慘烈了。</p>
<p>擊沉　戰艦　四艘　驅逐艦　三艘　運輸艦　四艘　巡洋艦　二艘</p>
<p>擊傷　大巡洋艦　六艘重傷　巡洋艦或驅逐艦四艘　大運輸艦　一艘　擊落飛機十五架</p>
<p>三次戰</p>
<p>在美國方面為了掩飾他的敗績，非一而再再而三的想報復不可。同時各　登陸部隊，也需　續不斷的補充與接濟，勢成　虎欲罷不能。在日本方面，以價値較小的空軍去拚高代價的艦隊，自認為千載一時的良機。</p>
<p>十一月十一日便出現了雙方互炸的悲劇。是日上午，美國航空母艦與陸上航空隊聯絡，一舉出動二百架以上的飛機，轟炸日本的海空根據地拉巴爾，而日本航空隊，却捨輕就重，進攻美國的機動艦隊。一方面拉巴爾日軍沉沒驅逐艦一艘，輕傷巡洋艦一艘，輕傷巡洋艦一艘，損失十隻飛機，交換了美方七十一架飛機。另方面摩諾島西方的美艦隊，遭遇了空前的惡運。</p>
<p>美方的艦隊分成兩部，十一日午刻被發現的是以航空母艦為中心的一部，經過日機猛攻後，炸沉巡洋艦或是驅逐艦一艘，大型航空母艦二艘都中了幾個炸彈，另外有幾隻巡洋艦或驅逐艦起火。到了晚上，又發現以戰艦為中心的艦隊，在摩諾島西方的海中向北行駛當時氣　雖然惡劣，不易進攻，日機仍使一艘戰艦受到中傷，一艘大型巡洋艦重傷起火，日機也損失了三十艘。是戰的結果如下：</p>
<p>炸沉　巡洋艦　一艘</p>
<p>中傷　戰艦　一艘</p>
<p>輕傷　大航空母艦二艘</p>
<p>重傷火起　大巡洋艦　一艘　巡洋艦或大驅逐艦三艘　驅逐艦　一艘</p>
<p>四次戰</p>
<p>日海軍機　了　　，日夜不斷的向根據地　　　，果然，十一月十三日晨三時發現美艦　利用十二日的黑夜，以　　為中心，　以重巡洋艦，輕巡洋艦，驅逐艦的　　部隊，從東方向日軍根據地拉巴爾推進，巳數到　　摩諾島的　方。</p>
<p>日機開　便以戰艦航空母艦為目標，展開猛烈的　　魚雷艦，不久　　一隻重傷，艦尾冒出　烟發生火災。速力大减，氣息奄奄了。同時航空母艦起了大火災，甚至幾乎沉沒。事後日方雖未　之列入擊沉的　內，可是估計起來，大有沈沒的可能。右方，有大小巡洋艦各一艘被炸沉，驅逐艦一艘中了魚雷，但是日本的兩隻飛機，也作了　高的犧牲了。</p>
<p>這次空戰有個特點，就是海軍機實行了最困難的夜間攻擊和魚雷戰。在夜間　敵實在不易，僅賴着海面困艦隊過而激起的一條殘跡，發現與跟蹤這些殘跡，必須將飛機低得幾乎觸着海面，一個不小心，便會與波臣為伍。至於進攻時，尤須神乎其技，這種技能，正是日本海軍航空兵多年磨練的結果。第四次空戰的結果如下。</p>
<p>炸沉　大巡洋艦　一艘</p>
<p>炸沉　巡洋艦　一艘</p>
<p>擊沉　驅逐艦　一艘</p>
<p>重傷　戰艦　一艘　中型航空母艦一艘</p>
<p>五次戰</p>
<p>第五次波島海面大空戰的性質，與第一次戰相同，而戰果猶有過之，僅僅去年十月二十六日南太平洋海戰。日本曾一舉炸沉美國三　航空母艦才可比擬。美國此次不　犧牲的頑强戰法，在慣以最少犧牲換最高代價的日本人看來，科是愚不可及的。這大概是因為美國物力太豐富的原故。</p>
<p>十七日未明，以航空母艦三艘為基幹，配以巡洋等艦的有力大美國艦隊又在波島南方數十海里之外發現了。日本的「海　」，又發揮他們的「捕捉」戰術，樹立了赫赫的戰果：</p>
<p>大　航空母艦一艘</p>
<p>中　航空母艦二艘　巡洋艦　三艘　大　軍艦（　　不明）　一艘</p>
<p>在上　攻擊的同時，日本又　出戰鬥機隊轟炸機隊，進攻特羅基納角的美軍上陸　　艦隊，　　艦隊上空有三十架戰鬥機　　着，當日本戰鬥機向前攻擊的時候，那　雷　轟炸機　一擁而上，　　　　，然而樹立戰功歸來，不幸被百架左右的美國戰鬥機追　，　之損失了十架飛機，這役戰果是：</p>
<p>擊沉　中小型運輸艦共三艘</p>
<p>擊傷　小運輸艦　一艘</p>
<p>起火　驅逐艦　一艘</p>
<p>時，日本　　　　　　第六　　　　　戰大　　　　　　說十二月　　　　　　南方，　　　　　航　　　艦二艘，戰艦或大型　　艦一艘，大型巡洋鑑　　，擊沉航空母艦一艘，此外　　一艘起火重創，大　　　　及　　　　一艘重傷。</p>
<p>一筆賬</p>
<p>未已，日本海軍傳統的卓　　　　在　的克敵精神，正與美國豆大的生產力　　　着，　之，都　將來炙膾人口　赫赫武功，好似已　定了日　在等候，我們估就已知戰果，作戰統計，　以推算美國究竟受到怎樣重大的損失，究竟還勝多少實力，不是沒有意義的。</p>
<p>合計雙方損失與受傷的軍艦，共有九十三艘，小型的舟艇，尙不在內。擊落的美機，達五七六架，受傷的也有十六架。此外有一艘驅逐艦，因為誤會擊起火。日本除巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦二艘沉沒，巡洋鑑二艘受傷外，不過犧牲了若干飛機而已。</p>
<p>我們從另一角度去看，自從十月底摩諾島附近海戰以來，美國究竟損失了多少受過訓練的水兵，又有多少軍艦建造　　了海底的　　。依照日本井口情報官的算法，根據上表推算起來：</p>
<p>（註）僅計炸沉擊沉，擊毀之修理費不在內。</p>
<p>從十月底至十二月初短短的一個月零幾天中，在遼遠的南海一角幾百里海面中，兩萬多美國兵從此無聲無　地長眠在海底了，費了七萬萬差不多以上建造的　　巨艦沉淪為海底的廢鐵，戰况的慘烈與日軍的勇敢，自可想像而知了。</p>
<p>波島地勢圖說明</p>
<p>由於此次戰事而一　聞名之波根維爾島，為所羅門羣島西北端之一島。係一七六八年法人勃根堡於周遊世界途中所發現。該島面積一萬方公里，為所羅門羣島中之最大者。東　除首邑開　羅基納角附近，則為潤濕之沼澤地，住民三萬，分為米勒乃西亞及居住於該島僻地之巴布亞系山　種族二種。</p>

<p>— 北村小松</p>
<p>從西徂東</p>
<p>我們知道有敵糧一隊！包括航空母艦三艘，在遠離　　國的本土的大洋上，向四進行中。那等，我們反乘飛機向東方飛去。</p>
<p>我跟著在印度洋上蒙漬英國海軍勢力的〇〇部隊之一部，出發就航三千四百哩航　的最後一段，　到三千四百　的航程，雖然是聯給從地球上的一點訓男一點的距離，決不會是機大的距離。然而遭運離，我不會不感到在人類所飛行的距離上，決不是短的距離。</p>
<p>美國的某報道員，批評我軍此次的作戰　：日軍忘記了距離的觀念而作戰着。」</p>
<p>從事於此戰，南越赤道·又北歸赤道·西行數百哩，又東行數百哩，深感我軍忘却距離這觀念，搜索敵人，捕捉敵人·而開始戰鬥。但在擊減敵人之前，念頭中深印上之「距離」的觀念，和距離相戰，而克服距離。</p>
<p>我不能不說，他們的作戰觀念，把馬來的業林當作盾，海的浩渺當倚靠，而進行作戰，遭種觀念·和我們的觀念，大不相同。</p>
<p>我在這裏想到帖木耳的故事。</p>
<p>守備帖水耳為的荷印兵們說：</p>
<p>「日本軍是卑怯的！」</p>
<p>問他們「何故呢？」</p>
<p>「日本軍決不從正面來攻我們張着鐵絲網，嚴爲防備著的陣地。深夜中從我們的個面，後方出其不意地襲來。這不是營幕戰……」</p>
<p>—不是無格之談。我們不是在作遊戲或競賽，我們在作戰。我們決不像英美般在玩着競賽的戰爭。在這裏也表現出他們的我們的觀念之不同。</p>
<p>讀者諸君大概曾讀過海軍報道班員之一，同乘飛機在遙遠的印度洋上作索敵飛行的筆錄吧！</p>
<p>那筆錄中，讀者會感到海軍在戰鬥之前，怎樣與這大的「距離」作戰的情形。</p>
<p>夏威夷海戰也好，馬來海戰也好，爪哇海戰也好，我軍決不忘却距離而戰，無寗說，念頭中有着「距離」這觀念，由於克服那距離的精神力和機動力，而獲得這些大戰果。</p>
<p>我想到現在為止所越通的海，所飛過的空。那空，實在是廣漢的空。那海·實在是蒼茫的海。</p>
<p>波上</p>
<p>「燈火戰鬥管制！」</p>
<p>日沒時，艦內聽到當值水兵的這聲音。</p>
<p>窗完全關上鐵扉，窗玻璃上覆着一分堅的遮蔽幕。艦內的電燈，不能不管制到最小限度。</p>
<p>「軍艦在大海上駛行，很凉快吧！」</p>
<p>有打算說這種話的人，但這種話正和說「到海上去，可以吃很多的魚吧……」的話同樣，不能說是錯覺。</p>
<p>那種話，和「乘飛機飛行，可以捕捉很多的島吧！」的話一樣，不能說是應酬話。</p>
<p>當然，如其冬季航行北方的海，的確很凉快，而逼受暴烈的寒氣。但關於此次跟著軍艦在赤道那西南方海洋的作戰中航行，而說「很凉快吧！」這種話，也不能說是空話。</p>
<p>「一日空閒了，便想飲沒有燙過的酒。」</p>
<p>有人說著這樣的述懷。</p>
<p>航行南海中的船上的酒，完全被清上的熱氣燙熱了。當然，食用水也是這樣。</p>
<p>在這地方，熱也不但一會事了。</p>
<p>在東京的夏天，晚上乘凉時，我們常說：「天氣很熱，今天晚上睡不着了……」</p>
<p>然而東京之夜的　苦，不及盤谷，但猶可耐。如其和航行赤道下的洋艦之　苦比較起來。完全比不上。</p>
<p>艦上的鐵板，被太陽直射，幾乎發燒，其所吸收的熱氣，至夜　漸發放</p>
<p>有風　的屋子，熱風胡胡地在狹小的屋子中旋轉，那熱風吹上身來，汗如雨下，在這情形下，無論怎樣不能再說凉快了。渾身衣衫，從襯衫起，完全沾濕。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但並不想換。在發寒熱時，飲了發汗　坐在蒲團上出汗，我不能不想到那時出汗的情形正與此相同。如其要換級衣，恐怕也幾百件吧！且第一，因沒有漢水而受眼制，艦上也不能那樣大量洗濯。</p>
<p>我們又不能赤艦而訊，何以呢？因為我們在戰爭中。不能知道何時遭過敵人而不能不開始戰關。如其在戰爭中，艦腹隨時有被敵艦潛水艦的魚雷命中的情事。那塲合，誰也不能演出赤體飛出的　態。</p>
<p>受著這熱氣的蒸盡，我腦海中浮起煮蛋的情形。煮蛋中如其有心，那恰似「戰鬥管制」下的軍艦航行於赤道下的情彩。我們的心境正是這樣。</p>
<p>那樣看來，又不能不浮起許多無根據的聯想。我們不恰像半熱的嗎？…</p>
<p>到了半熱，頭直往下沉，打着盹兒，抬不起頭來。我們在屋子中忍受着這種苦况，實非可言喻。</p>
<p>走廊下一片赤黑。機房中的熱氣，充滿着艦內。因塲所的關係，鼻島窒悶，不辨一切。</p>
<p>現在到便所去，須挂着杖，恰似年老的婆婆，一面用手在黑略中摸索，一面在應下一步步往前闖。也有從對面來的水兵，邊襲邊走過來。</p>
<p>「請仔細前面通路，不要心慌。」</p>
<p>最初乘艦時必須法意這情形，所以在空閒中即已仔細研究，雖然通路自以為已經摸熟了，不致於對面碰到人了，但在屋子入口的鐵門檻上還要擦破皮膚，或在扶梯的半途，以為已經是平地面踏失脚，這種事常常發生，不足為奇的。</p>
<p>某型驅逐艦的士官室，因酷熱，在出第一甲板的出入口，開了一個可通一人的四角形孔，但那裏面這是熱不可當。</p>
<p>那士官室中，在如此酷熱下用膳時，自己所吃的飯中，自己的汗簌落簌落地掉在飯碗裏。</p>
<p>我用自己的汗當作鹽味而下飯。人的有眉毛，眞正很必要。假使沒有這眉毛，韻上的汗流入眼中，那麼吃一頓飯眞要弄瞎眼睛。眉毛那東四，不但為了眉目秀麗，這是人和狗不同的地方，是為了防汗所必要，恰似鐵道的防雪林一樣，眞惑到造化之妙。</p>
<p>甲板</p>
<p>酷熱中，跑出甲板看時，艦上燈火完全消滅了，在黑暗中破浪前進。</p>
<p>「蘇生過來了！」這括在此時說挺合式。</p>
<p>那眞是現實地從生死之間存下來的，所以實是不可恩議的。</p>
<p>乘在艦上，被敵人的飛行堡壘追擊着，俞後歷八小時。直待敵人的飛機離去後，卞才從軍艦的屋子中跑出甲板，婆羅門海的風，沐浴全身。此時，方才是眞的「蘇生過來了！」那不是奇踏嗎？</p>
<p>往上仰望時，右面是北斗七星，左面是南十字星，美麗地閃　着。</p>
<p>在那壯麗的星空之下，艦直往滇西走。我曉望着前方的水平綫。那邊，不見一只船影，不見一座小島的影子。然而我的腦海中。已經浮起最初在印度洋作戰的艦艇之姿，虎視耽耽，待機並翼而進的那前進基地的航空部隊之新銳機和飛行員之姿。透過狹際的甲板、看到　影在星光下，看見軍醫長和主計長因暑不能成眠，坐在椅子貪乘夜凉。</p>
<p>艦長和副艦長在艦橋上提心吊胆地注視着前方。自從軍艦出港後，艦長往來在艦橋上下來，飲食亦在艦橋上，一面用飯，一面瞪眼看着屋和艦首。</p>
<p>士官室中在慶祝二三日前昇通大尉的主計長，那慶祝。當然，在未到目的地，未完成目的前也祇能草率將就。我跟着那一個部隊，看見些什麼事，不容自由自在地迅述記述了，和我一同為海軍報道州員而從軍的人們，或以把　前登陸的狀况報告諸君，或描寫各次戰門的情彩，或寫述潛水艦的筆錄，所以我不想再寫這種新聞式的報告了。我睛時位諒解，我在諸君之前報道「大事」之前，先寫了這片斷的文章。</p>
<p>却說，我在主計長誇的空椅子上坐下來，暫時解脫了「煮蛋」的心境。我韓過目光來看看從夜光虫閃閃地發光的海面一直到遙遠的水平綫。當然，我的眺望是無止境的。歷經訓練的眼，在瞭望這大海。對飛機的警戒，對潛水艦的警戒，實是忍耐那東西的工作。</p>
<p>「在某增被中魚雷，實是厲害啊！」</p>
<p>打被了沉寂，主計長開始談起潛水艦的故事了。</p>
<p>「一枚向着艦尾，被我們躲過了，另一枚向本艦的中央，但在未到本艦之前，先已沉沒了……」</p>
<p>「魚雷的航跡，實在再清楚也沒有了……」</p>
<p>「不知什麼時候，年輕的航海士從傍插話。邊請邊噠噠噠噠地走上艦　去了。</p>
<p>「但在潛水艦上，酷熱眞沒有辦法……第一，不能拿出椅子什麼到甲板上來乘凉……」</p>
<p>軍醫長喃喃地自言自語着。</p>
<p>比起這艦來，潛水艦眞酷熱。那友軍的潛水艦的行動範圍須得從遙遠的印度洋到美國沿岸。</p>
<p>我一面擦着汗方乾的腕臂，一面望着稍微露出於波濤上的司令塔和甲板，想起了那某某地的潛水艦之勇壯的姿勢。</p>
<p>遠有比這再熱的地方嗎？我同到寢室中安息，重又想起了「煮蛋的心境」。那酷熱中，在比這艦還　遠的海上活動的人們。正在進行大戰　…。</p>
<p>飛行</p>
<p>我身上　了三種軍裝。見到我將乘坐的飛機，發動機已轟轟地開始轉動了，雖着了短袖短　的防　服，在這酷暑的熱帶基地，但打好了　也的領帶，着上了三套軍裝，汗不　　　地說下，袖衫盡濕。然而如共飛到三千米的上空，冷不可耐，所以乘飛機和乘船各有各的苦勞。</p>
<p>最初飛出　基地，遠望下面廣大的森林地帶，越過越南國境時。我身體突然發冷，正如發寒熱時的　子。身體略動，就喘息不止。看高度計，針指着近五千米的地方。</p>
<p>「如其不是慣常的搭乘員，當然越過四千米就要感到困苦。」</p>
<p>U軍醫大休這樣說，接着：</p>
<p>「在三千米感到困苦者可算是不健康的人，如普通人過四千米健方感到不舒服。」</p>
<p>空襲達爾文港的一役S君：想攝影，無意之中，把吸人酸棄的管子　在口中，因氣昧惡劣，立即大吐。空襲塲合的最高度飛行，如不經過嚴肅的訓練，當然不能動手。我們試看年輕而優秀的戰鬥機搭乘員。尼稱舉落敵機丸架的這二十二歲的K二等飛行兵曹，那時在緬旬戰綫，在　烈的攻擊精神之下，毅然低飛至飛機塲的上空槍擊，使一機起火，更槍擊避於椰子林中的另外一機，亦使之起火，正在轉變方向飛回時，那張在地上的敵鐵絲綢，掛住了左面的翼端，然那鐵絲綱的一部就掛在翼上地能飛同。這種大胆的超低路飛行，掛住了障害物還能平安歸還的手段，決不是僅靠「幸運」和「奇續」所致。</p>
<p>「從普通練習進向高級練習機時，目光有時轉愛。鯎而從高級練習機進向〇。戰鬥機時，經過戰鬥訓練，目光又有轉變。此次乘〇〇戰鬥機時，又大不相問……但愈胆大了。即使駕駛〇〇戰鬥機至其限度，也極平常」—</p>
<p>大羣的長距離轟炸隊的搭乘員，大羣的戰鬥機隊搭乘員，以至大羣的偵察隊，哨戒隊的搭乘員們所從事的世界無比的戰鬥，決不是一朝一夕所致。一步一步，經過其肉體的，精神的訓練階段，而到逮這樣的偉大。—我們這樣想着。</p>
<p>一切訓練，並不是一蹴可幾，向其目的　等的。K二飛行兵曹從初等練習機一躍而至搭乘〇〇戰鬥機，開始戰鬥，那搭乘員在戰鬥之前，常有恐怕損害自身的結果，那是很顯然的。</p>
<p>這種情事，不單是關於飛機，即在社會的訓練上，正也有同樣的情事。這情事，第一。明示任何事必須經過不斷的訓練。同時，並也啓示「太過份」包含着怎樣的危險。</p>
<p>機上</p>
<p>我靜靜地坐在電報員的一傍，目前是悠然地把着把手的駕駛員們年靑的後彩。眺望窓外，先行的某編隊，清晰地浮動着。</p>
<p>那近傍，是包括戰機在內的本編隊，搭乘人員的一個個面部表情，都歷歷可見。</p>
<p>模糊的水平綫的那方，在一望無際的大海原上，有企圖空襲我本土前進中的敵方艦隊在行動。</p>
<p>我一面胸頭隱藏如燃　一般强烈的感情，一而睜眼　　這廣漢的大海洋中那裏有數艦隊在蠢動。閉起眼睛來，我的心　可以着見那敵艦隊的　勢—但再睜開眼來，我的肉眼所見，祇是蒼茫的　，悠悠的大空，一望無　。而在道廣漢的大空和大洋之間，可以發見僅備一　　點的敵艦隊，我海軍的「眼」不是神　嗎？</p>
<p>我同　在高空的嚴寒中抱着自已的身體，在法視各種計測　及　，而從事航行工作的偵察員。我在這裏也看到那同樣的眼。我又眺望那小艦艇中「眺望」着　茫大海中一點的那些人們時。又見到那同樣的驚異。這或許是神　。我感到這是一種組織之有機的結合。</p>
<p>電報員不聲不響的把熱　食送過來：「不吃一點嗎？」</p>
<p>我收下了，也把糖菓送給他。</p>
<p>我不奈想到降落傘部隊的年靑兵士們。</p>
<p>我所乘的飛機，正是在四里伯大空上，運　日水戰史上最初的海軍降落傘部隊人員而降下的飛機之一，那兵隊也就是用這飛機第二次在帖木耳島降落作戰時的兵隊。</p>
<p>可愛的靑年們！——我對於各種部隊的靑年們，什麼時候都抱着這種親愛的心情。尤其降落傘部隊的年輕兵士，實在與快，那是最就感到是「頂兒尖兒」的男子漢。我最初從〇〇基地進出時所乘的船，那船上滿載着無數的「健康兒」標本般壯實的兵隊，就是他們。</p>
<p>起初我不知道那部隊是何種部隊。從其裝備，從其在船上的訓練，我處處都覺得奇怪。不久我才知道，「哦！就是這……」。</p>
<p>這些可親的靑年兵士們，不時嘻笑着到我的船室來遊玩，拿着糖果遞給我：</p>
<p>「先生！不吃嗎？」</p>
<p>他們不知道怎樣稱呼我—才遇二十餘歲的人，終究稱了一聲「先生」。</p>
<p>我很喜歡同他們談天。</p>
<p>「關於我們自己的配置我訓練，以前從未親說過一句。那眞是再苦也沒有的事。……假使因自己不熟練而受責也不說什麼。完全從死中逃生過來，現在可以安心地飛降下去丁，等着瞧吧！」……</p>
<p>昂然拐着眉，津津有味地談着，他們多麼眞率啊！</p>
<p>我最初被敵人的飛行堡壘轟炸時，正和這些兵士們乘在一條船上，那時，我頭腦中最强烈地感到的，乃是「這部隊不會在這裏被殺死的。</p>
<p>我既不自以為偉大，也不想粉飾自的感情。完全因為在這種「生活」中，才親身體會到這種有恃無恐的情緒。但是想到他們之中有幾個已經在南方戰綫殉國了，不禁捶胸默思。</p>
<p>因電報員的好意，把熱糧食送給我，使我浮起和電報員差不多年紀的降落傘部的兵士們。</p>
<p>雲</p>
<p>——太陽已經爬過我們的頭頂，向西方落下去了。</p>
<p>今日早晨以來，一直在空中旋轉來往着的二只發動機，一點也沒有休息。計器坂上，速度計〇〇〇徑，高度計四千三百米。眺望發動機和似銀盆般迥旋着的推通器時，前面是美麗的千變萬化的雲　，從雲縫中，可以見到大洋中大礁石的神秘的寶石色彩，脚下現出了描着二條弧的奇妙的虹。——白　上面，我　的影子印上一個一個圓圈。在那滾圓的　狀的　中……這種古人在夢中也不知道的自然的壯麗，我們已經飽覽了幾次了。</p>
<p>那壯麗的自然之美使我忘掉了戰塲上的立塲，呼吸的迫促之苦，和索索地發抖的寒冷。胸頭幾次　　　飛於太空中如羽化登仙的快樂。</p>
<p>但自然決不僅用那種優美的或壯麗的姿態迎接我們，還空中種種美觀的現象，隨時成為航空部隊的作戰障碍。</p>
<p>四方的夕陽之光，一直綫渡過大海，　射東方大空，奇形怪狀的密雲，把前方　斷。</p>
<p>第一　隊似往下沈般降下了高度。從高空看來，那恰似浮遊於大海表面的小　之姿。</p>
<p>展開航空　時，知道我們已快近目的地了。且前面不見一樣東西，　有重重疊疊的雲山載斷去路。</p>
<p>我們這一隊也降低了高度。高度計的釘三千，二千，千……我們在機內頗感得　熱起來了。</p>
<p>見有一陣大雨。鉛色的雲業已在我們的後面遮斷了日光。先前所見水天一色的前方海面，冒起一重重白色窒塞的雲。</p>
<p>不要闖過去吧——我這樣想着。</p>
<p>這雲雖然沒有酸素，但從未見過有這樣低的雲。我想起了幾時曾闖進過這種雲。</p>
<p>——翼端才可以辨淸東四的「白霧」中，暴雨的聲音，蓋可了發動機的馬達聲。太陽也不見，地上也不見。</p>
<p>飛行在晴朗的天空中所見的雲千變萬化的姿勢，虹的壯麗！不過，見到那雲，那虹，以至突入這暴雨，眞不過一瞬的時間，而我們降陸約地方被遮斷了。頓時變成了玩弄我們的感情，使我們戰慄的　　世界。</p>
<p>一陣暴雨未過，前面又有一陣暴雨接踵而來。編隊急於廻避前面的暗雲，側過翼來，變換方向。</p>
<p>我們一隊中的友機，都祗見到一小點的黑影。我們開始重又飛上高空。太陽又從西方的水平綫開始照射着列機的翼了。</p>
<p>的確，在那厚雲下，浮着目的的小島。但我們的肉眼，不能見到。</p>
<p>這如其是單機，則或許就此突入大暴雨中，飄浮在海面上而到達目的地，但我們是組成的隊伍，指揮官機似乎打算除非燃料發生問題，否則不必作以上的冒險。</p>
<p>編隊在旋廻着尋求大的雲裂縫。偵察員開始可驚的活躍，把刻刻變動的飛機的位置記入圖上。</p>
<p>雲的隙縫一點也沒有。——飛在雲上面嗎？</p>
<p>假使，飛過了在海洋祇有那麼一小點的目的地，那麼，前面將又是茫茫漢漢的大海。夕陽即將落山了。再過三十分鍾，白晝的光，就要從大空中消逝了。大海已顯出　黑色，如其夜幕籠罩過來……那就是大感困難的意思。</p>
<p>此後三十分鐘，在這雲下如其不見有島，我們就有相當的危險。我從未感到有像地球自轉一樣快的東西。「一落千丈」，三十分鐘之後，這空中的太陽就要這樣「一落千丈」的落下水平綫去了。</p>
<p>偵察員看着我微笑着，在結教命　的紐帶。</p>
<p>我到還沒有感到切實的危機。我一句話也不說。也不回顧我們的友機。或許因為見到那悠着操縱輪的靑年駕駛員之後影而　到放心吧？</p>
<p>一次戰鬥</p>
<p>忽然，我們前面見有　與　之間的溪谷，第一　似小麻雀般穿　活動的溪谷。——這　　或許隨時有併合而封閉這　　的可能。但，我們的眼睛，從這谷間，見到遠遠的鉛色的海上有一點的　影。</p>
<p>我們飛到那島，全體平安降陸後，大空和這孤島，重又綫大為雨封閉了。</p>
<p>「假使再　三十分……」</p>
<p>那夜，我們大家見面之後，都不約而同的說道話。但至於我本身，這還不能說是切實的危機。在此之前，你在道太平洋上曾接到無錢電會令：「全機在二千米距離中搜索失蹤機，」向目的地飛行三小時的時間，那時我胸中的確感到迫促。某機因傍舷發動機發生障碍，送過了「我或許也是失蹤之一」的通信之後，就斷絕消息了。</p>
<p>所以這次飛行，並不如上次那樣感到危機的迫促。但我心中所感受的，出於想像之外的强烈。那不能說是戰友愛的感情嗎？</p>
<p>這無邊無際的大海，如其　　　　芥子　那樣一點大小的失蹤飛機，似感到絕望的　情，喚起了種種想像，　激　着心胸。假使　見……無論如何不會是　上機，假使這　　看到搭乘以為是失蹤機的人們的影子？我將張開眼睛來看他嗎？</p>
<p>駕駛者，　　員，偵察員，電報員，焦急地張着八只眼睛。向四面海原　視着，發動機的聲音，支配時間與空間，我們不能不遭遇和這發動機的生命相關聯的人類生命這自然前偉大，這是比和敵人戰鬥還要艱苦的鬥爭。這又是戰鬥以前和「距離」交戰的一種戰姿態。</p>
<p>想起祖國</p>
<p>祖國的本土被空襲！</p>
<p>接到道報告，我們　到遙遠的祖國也變成前方了。接到那報告時，任何人心中的都感到，建國以，來，無論經過幾次戰事，無論其人數怎樣衆多，從未經騐過此次戰爭的情形</p>
<p>那夜，靑白的新月，掛在南海的大空，難得的凉風，從東方吹來。我們一面眺望着那新月，一面和士官們談論祖國的事情。敵人現在如大胆前來，一舉就可以覆滅！</p>
<p>我們話題的中心，談論這空襲對後方將有怎樣的影響？</p>
<p>當然，這種游擊式的空襲，對日軍的大作戰，大戰果，不會有何損害。</p>
<p>但，想到這是國家　力戰，後方的市民也配置在各自的戰鬥方位上，則道空襲給與市民的影響，也可以算是很有重大意義的一種影響。</p>
<p>「祖國無恙嗎？」—心裏深深地沈思着，大家都在談這件事。我們信賴軍隊鎭定而頑强一應付。例如不懂戰爭的人和一般市民的　　，那不過是小題大做。小題大做的　　就不能擊滅敵人，我們祗知道作戰則信賴軍隊而頑抗。</p>
<p>請看！珊瑚海海戰的偉績。敵人被我海軍打敗之後，將出何舉動，我們早有確信。同時，敵人也在計劃，何以呢？想前來空襲本土的敵人，恐怕被我方發見而一舉被殲，故不是僅用少數大型機從我海軍機的行動半徑之外急進速退嗎？這確是美國式的作風。目觀這空襲的諸君，大概都可以確認吧！</p>
<p>他們此次不希望北美B25的歸艦，這種所謂單程空襲的精神，和我海軍的攻擊珍珠灣精神，有很大的距離，諸君大概也可以知道吧？這決不是拼死擊滅的精神，那搭乘員的精神’當然也非珍珠灣特別攻擊隊的殉國精神可比。他們以為離開母艦，通過日本上空，而能　到中　大陸，那就性合可保了。這和前次大戰中美國飛行隊的「勇士們」所具的賭博精神一樣。</p>
<p>但是他們這種「賭博精神」，我們不能不大加警戒。他們知道我團對俘虜是怎樣的寬大。他們如其利用我們的寬大而前來，這實是危險。他們和我們不同，不以為當俘虜是不名譽的。他們不會抱着比此次夏蠶的炸彈，從更遠的地方前來空雙，任務完畢，舉起二手，乘降落傘下來投降嗎？</p>
<p>我們不要忘記，他們現在還妄自　大，而渺視我們。他們此次拿了小型惡性的燒夷彈前來亂　，從另一面說來，也以日本的都市為「渺小」，我們不能不想到，他們有用那種燒夷彈來來燒燬我們的都市的念頭。他們的閒談中沒有一次不談到戰爭，我們不能不警戒他們的精神。</p>

<h3 id="c55">珍珠灣空襲以後 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，自從大東亞戰爭爆發以來，今日已是第三個十二月八日了。當此大東亞戰爭二周年紀念日，不禁想起了開戰當日珍珠　頭激戰的情景。珍珠灣是太平洋美國海軍的最大據點，關於當時激戰的情形，過去早有種種報道，但本文則是最近自美蘇國的當地日僑所親自見聞的記錄，用特　譯如下，以饗讀者。——譯者附</p>
<p>是眞的攻擊</p>
<p>頭上，波因B17的編隊向韋拉飛行塲方面飛去。這就是那個十二月八日（夏威夷時間是七日）以來從美國本土連日空　而來的增援部隊。像這種屬於軍事上機密的兵力移動，為什麼竟在白　實行呢？原來在那日壯烈激戰後的夜間八時左右，曾有十九架波因B17的編隊從美國桑地亞哥（San　Diego）趕來增援，不料竟被珍珠灣的地上部隊誤認為日本飛機苒來空襲，因而狂鳴高射砲，十九架美機幾乎全部擊　。飛機上的美國航空人員，受到高射砲的（歡迎）以後，還以為珍珠灣已被日軍佔領，將所携的炸彈全都擲了下來，結果鬧成損害相當嚴重的笑話，自此以後，空輸也就改在白晝舉行了。我和妻在番石榴樹蔭下，從阿萊伐高地由小路追着飛機向崩契婆　跑去，希望去看一看祖國勇士捨身的珍珠灣。我倆在陡急的坡道上喘息着，望着珍珠灣的綠波，虔誠默禱祖國勝利。這已是日軍空襲珍珠灣以後的第三天早晨。我們為了一覩血戰遺跡，默識戰績於胸，所以不願當地軍事當局下午六時至上午八時止禁止出外的戒嚴令，於淸晨攀登阿萊伐北方的丘陵，俯瞰下方，環顧韋基之海濱以至火奴魯魯之市街及其四方的珍珠灣一帶。</p>
<p>在十二月八日晨，我聽到孩子高呌「盡咨日丸的飛機」時，剛剛吃過早實，　着烟斗，望着它的靑烟　　地昨夜被風雨洗淸的蓝天上昇，陶然自樂。在那個時候，不獨是我，就是問阿胡為上的任何住民，也一定會答道：「是演習呀！」可是，數分鐘之後，從遠方傳來了隆隆然的遠　似的聲音，而且愈來　響。那時，我的脊樑突然如同有一條虫迅速爬過一樣，感到了一種異樣的感覺。</p>
<p>馬上走無綫電收音機前面，用顫動的手將刻度盤旋到K·G·U·電台，後又旋到K·G·M·B·電台，立刻聽到無綫電台叫道。「珍珠灣這受日軍攻攻擊。是眞的攻擊!」</p>
<p>「是眞的攻擊！」啊，不是夢嗎？自從在夏威夷登岸以來，每逢受到美國當局的壓迫時我就在腦中擋畫出這樣的塲面，想不到果眞實現了！我在洋台上遙望着一陣陣湧起來黑烟，看見豆粒般的從空羣的依次突入烟中，在半中像紐絲般畫着圓圈，呈現在絲山藍空的背景前的這幅壯烈的圖畫，的確美妙極了。</p>
<p>不知經過了多少時候，無綫電在呼集醫師看護了。聽到了這個呼聲，我憬悟到事態的嚴重。尤其在聽到招集殯儀館人員時，不禁令人笑了出來。</p>
<p>街上亂極了。想打電話到朋友那裏去也打不通。在焦慮中挨到正午，日語學校K先生拿着幾份號外新聞來打聽消息。據他告訴我，在火奴魯魯市區方面，日本人有十幾個被高射砲彈的碎片擊中，有些是傷重殞命了，有些雖不曾送掉性命，可也受到重傷。他又告訴我說，歇克曼·加內典埃·　特等飛機塲全被炸燬，軍艦也大受損失。</p>
<p>在驚慌不安中過了一日。夜中聽到爆炸的聲音，心裏想着：「不要是日軍上陸了吧？「因為當時谣言很多，什麼日本傘兵登陸啦，潜水艇潛入軍港啦，聽起來很可使人相信，我也這樣相信着，直到後來方才知道祗有潛水艇潛入軍港的消息是確實的。第二天早晨，在軍用卡車疾駛聲中，天漸漸亮了。</p>
<p>許多親眼目覩的人，都互相陳述當時的情景，最使我感動的，要算M醫師的僕歐所講的話了。他說他在巴希菲克高地目擊一架自爆的日軍飛機，機翼是沒有了，機體也燒焦了，裏面幾個油污滿身的航空人員，大家互相庇護似地倒在那裏，其中一位勇士還緊緊握着軍刀。說到這裏，僕歐彷彿很詫異地道：「他們連降落傘也沒有帶！」我們深為日本軍人精神的崇高感動，不禁流下淚來。後來我們又聽說軍港方面還在搜查日本特殊潛航艇，同時開始收容燬壞的美國軍艦的戰死者。</p>
<p>翌晨（十日），我和妻爬上阿萊伐出。韋拉方面因複加里希山遮住，不能望見，但仍可看到那方冒着薄煙。看哪！珍珠灣！四日前傲然雄踞那方的美國太平洋艦隊，現在是往何處去了呢？並不像出港進擊的光景哪！看啊！那邊不是傾倒的戰艦的殘骸嗎？那些來往駛動的，都是小艇。在張網壁！灣口，有幾艘似乎是驅逐艦，正在投下爆雷。水柱冒起來了，未幾，隆隆之聲不絕傳來。再向別處一望，那邊似乎不曾有過二日前轟動世界的大戰，風光是平靜的，不變的。常我沒沈在無窮的感慨中時，妻突然嘯嘯地道：「在那水下……」在番石榴樹下望着珍珠灣的我們，不禁淚湧如泉。我們謹向日本最尊貴的人物下拜，不知不覺地跪在地上，合起掌來。我和妻的手，不知何時用力緊握着樹葉，竟弄得滿手靑綠了。（土木包工M氏記）</p>
<p>收音機畔低呼萬歲</p>
<p>眞是資妙的事情，自從日軍攻擊珍珠海後一農期左有，一般美國人對日本人的態度都變成非常　　親熱了，我們起初不明白他們的眞意，都感到有些發毛，後來才知道他們所以這樣。紙是希望在日軍登陸夏威夷時，我們會因此　他們爲親日分子。十二月八日的晚上當然不用說，就是以後的兩三日中，火奴魯魯也亂成一團糟。那時距離　　節已　很近，如果照往年的例子，福特街黎巴　百貨公司的大聖誕樹，早就可以哄動一時，但這年却誰也不去關心它了。本來，這株聖誕樹是每年特地從美國本部　最大的運來，在這沒有冬季的夏威夷，使人從它領會到冬的情緒，頗引起當地住民的注意，可是，這時，火奴厹魯魯市民最着急的是食糧。他們已沒有往時的閒情雅致，大家都一高峰地擁到食品店去，婦女們手裏携着　下挾着的，是大包小紮的鹽肉·火腿·罐頭食物等各式各樣的食品。從福特街·國王街的大食品公司到幾乎在火奴魯魯每條街角都有的威格剌食品聯號，全都擠滿了願客。不到幾小時，這些商店的東西彷彿風捲殘雲，銷售一空，可是購買的人仍絡繹湧來，弄得店家不得不拉上鐵門，讓那批尚未買到食物的羣眾在外面吵鬧。</p>
<p>從轟炸的那日起，即已頒布戒嚴令，從午後六時到早晨八時止，市民一概禁止出外。燈火管制也瘋狂地嚴厲施行。倘若屋內遮着的燈火稍有一絲微光透露出去，外面的巡捕便會開放手槍。碰到這種情形的人家，不知有多少。尤共在就寢的時候。而且巡捕在開槍以前決不警告。因此，一般市民都戰戰競競地在恐怖中挨過去。</p>
<p>幾日以後，對於日軍上陸的恐懼漸薄，於是對於當地日僑的壓迫也逐漸加强。被指為日本第五從隊而拘入聯邦調查局的日僑人數，逐日增加。聯邦調查局設於狄林格大樓。那是一座西班牙式的三層樓建築物，荷槍上刺的衛兵不讓日本人走近它前面的草地，如要走進這座建築物，那末除出從自己宅中由荷槍上刺的美兵　來以外，另無他法。例如原藉本願寺的H氏便其中之一。H氏因為他的傭人密告當局，說他在轟炸的前日熱心收聽無綫電，所以馬上被他們捕去。由聯邦調查局親轉解往G2（美國陸軍的謀報機關）和海軍謀報部，一直拘留了三個星期，方才准他歸家。同時，美國當局並開始收容日僑的有力分子。在火奴魯魯灣內的沙島上，頓時擠滿日本人，但另一方面，火奴魯魯市中却漸感人手不足，恐慌狀態日益加劇。本來，當地的木匠，農業人員幾乎全是日本人，而且為了修復炸燬的建築，增張要塞的工事，在在需要木匠，所以那時連能事不很高的木匠也可月入三百美金左右。蔬菜·水果等價格，也因運輸困難等原因，　　七·八倍。並且爲了陸海軍的增張及其糧秣的籌辨，物價更見高翔。不為收容美國士兵，從九日起，即命令日僑本願寺系的男女中等學校，小學校等各私立日語學校停課退出，將校合改作兵營。魚類也因禁止佔全島最多數的日籍漁夫出海捕魚，尤感缺乏，以致下級市民甚感困苦。</p>
<p>在這種乏味的生活中，唯一的安慰就是從無綫電收聽故國播送的捷音。日藉僑民雖皆不准便用短波收音機，但我們仍用盡手段調法偷聽，再不然則跑到第二代的日系美人家裏去聽日本的呼聲。不獨日僑如此，就是美國人亦然。這是什麼道理呢？原來他們已沒有地方去消遣了。韋基基海岸的稱為世界第一的海水浴塲，是禁止一般人出入了。那邊固不用說了，就是整個阿胡島的海岸，也都張起五·六重的鐵絲網，游泳是沒有希望了。至於登山，自金剛鑽頭要塞地區附近起，以至可以絮見夏威夷加內奧埃海軍飛機塲的奴阿奴·巴里一帶高地，全都禁人闌入。至若看電影，也祗有日裏一塲，韋基基的露天大影戲院如「公主影戲院」·「皇后劇塲」等，到了夜裏都像怪一般蹲在黑暗中，　無一人。因此他們祗得與無綫電做伴了。因為日本廣播的渣息和目擊夏威夷空襲的美人的話語符合一致，所以一般人都很相僧。美國人日本人所以不分敵友地一齋等待日本的廣播，實在是當然的事情。</p>
<p>當我們聽到馬來洋面海戰，新加坡陷落等報吿時，不知流了幾次感動的熱淚，同時也不知低聲喊了幾次萬歲。（日語學校教師〇氏記）（吉：譯自十一月廿六、廿七日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c56">吉爾伯特羣島 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 大戰回憶錄</p>
<p>聽到吉爾伯特羣島方面的大戰果，和美軍上陸瑪金，泰拉瓦的消息時，我的血沸騰起來了。囘憶去年八月十七日黎明，我在南方基地聞悉瑪金島上陸的消息，和「海鷲的勇士們一淘去轟炸。二個月後的十月末到十一月初止，又在那些島上勾留了十天。並以海軍報道班員的資格，環飛羣島上空一週，望見海陸空三位一體的堅强防務，曾感到無限的信賴。現在，空軍勇士們大約正在奮勇戰鬥吧。</p>
<p>吉島形勢</p>
<p>吉爾伯特羣島以馬紹　羣島東南二百六十哩的小瑪金為其最北端，共有瑪金，泰拉五等十六個島嶼，橫布南北，其地位正如擬向連結美澳的敵方輸血路的銳利匕首，是軍事上的重要據點，但經濟上除出椰子乾核以外，並無什麼價值。一九一七年此羣島之所以成爲英國保護領，也無非由於英國想藉壓馬紹爾羣島罷了。今日英美　用大艦隊奪囘這羣島嶼，同顧史實，也是可以首　的。</p>
<p>這或許是敵方在布根維爾島洋而接連慘收後的窮極無聊的舉動，但是，不論怎樣，他們在去年八月的上陸戰中失敗後，並未就此甘休，依舊妄　奪囘失地，所以這方面也將成為決戰之塲了。</p>
<p>泰拉瓦是從瑪金　飛機〇分鍾就可抵達的英國吉爾伯特官署的所在地，島形恰如躺着的猴子。相當於猴足的部位，是貝蒂奧島，有官器，郵政局，無綫電台，中央醫院，教堂等；共東爲庇里基島，有喬治五世學校；北岸係風平浪靜的內海，有大的棧橋突出其中。</p>
<p>瑪金島在行政上是次於泰拉瓦的重要島嶼，英國在島上置有島司。此島東北細長，在島的中央部分，南比僅三百公尺左右。去歲的瑪金作戰是在它的東部進行的，戰塲是椰子樹扶疎的地帶。</p>
<p>膚色相同</p>
<p>兩島的原住民共〇千名，他們誠心歡迎日軍登陸，操着不正確的英語道：「You　me　same　skin」（你我是膚色相同的。在瑪金戰役中，木匠拿亞的基一家，全部幫着日軍搬運子彈，担架傷兵，此外的島民也同他們一樣，協助日軍，並且朝夕在日軍幕前叩首感謝。他們將作日軍的手足協力擊滅美軍吧。吉爾怕特羣島中唯一的日僑神崎長次郎（原籍藤澤市立石原町），常說：「祗要見到皇軍的雄姿，隨便什麼時候死都行。」對於目前所有的戰果，將使大正二年（一九二三年）以來在南海孤島上過了三十年的他，感激涕零吧。</p>
<p>在這島上，沒有所羅門或新幾內亞那樣的密林，也沒有礦山，祗有疎落的椰子林和麵包樹，點綴各處。是這樣一個拔海數公尺的平坦島嶼。</p>
<p>到這裏，戰爭的情况歷應如在目前。同時，不禁想起記者離開該島時所見日軍將士的笑臉。那時，他們笑着對我說：「祗要我們尚在世上，決不讓羅斯福和邱吉爾有一日笑容。」（藤田義光特派員記）吉：譯自十一月二十四日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c57">崩潰中的大英帝國　依賴四種勢力茍延殘喘 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>值此大東亚战争二週年之际，更可确切感到的，便是大東亞戰爭對於英帝國的解體發生了多大的作用。並且如何促進了英帝國的沒落，法國屈伏後，繼續從事孤立無援的抗戰的英國，由於德蘇戰爭的開始，剛有稍舒喘息的機會，不料大東亞戰爭隨即勃發，香港，新加坡相繼失昭，英帝國的國防體系，因而支離滅裂，剩下的印度，也在日軍勝利的影響下，掀起了大規模的反英運動，即在今日，也有一舉粉碎大英帝國根本之觀。堅靱的英國人現正拼命努力，想從這窘境中掙扎出來、但是　後的英國，不獨有抵抗外部軍事威脅的必要，並且制於在政治上蠶食吞噬大英帝國的各種內部的敵性勢力，也非繼續拼命抗爭不可。這就是說，由於這次大戰的爆發，大英帝國缺乏獨力防衛自己的能力，已繼很明頣地暴露出來·英國今日是依賴着　领，勞工，美國，蘇聯這四大勞力的援助，才能繼持其殘喘的。這四大勢力雖是英國存亡關頭的最大的友伴，但同時也是想　食大英帝國的極危險的半敵性勢力，英國的抗戰，正是所謂噴火口畔的狂舞，</p>
<p>自治領的離背</p>
<p>最早而且最忠實地支持英國抗戰的，便是英國的自治殖民地。物和人的　源皆很微小的英國，若沒有屬地的幫忙，早就無法繼續戰爭了。可是，英國難仗各屬地的力量而抗戰，但隨戰爭的遷延不決，各屬領在英帝國的戰爭勢力中所占的比重，日益加大，所有屬領幾乎全體成為英本國的債權人，事實上巳呈暄賓奪主的狀態。在這樣的情勞之下，即使置南非的反英波爾人，印度的民族運動，加拿大的法系人民不論，英國的屬領，尤其是自治領，益呈獨立離背的傾向，也是理所當然的。最近在倫敦舉行的英帝國航空會議，可說是最能證明這種傾向了，　治領一方面各自要求自己的特殊權益，一方面拒絕接受本國政府委託的事項，這種事態實在打破了以英帝國為一單位而向外國爭的條件，明白顯示重建戰前渥太華協定那種協力體制的困難。所以在今日他國尙未挿身干涉的情形下，對於英國，其屬領可說是最和平的「敵人」了。</p>
<p>勞動階級憤懣</p>
<p>次於自治領而支持英國抗戰的，便是英國的勞動階級。邱吉爾組織內閣和德蘇戰爭爆發，巳使他們完全轉向支搏戰爭了。但是，關於遂行戰爭的方針，他們和政府之間並未完全一致，依然橫着一條雖以跨越的鴻溝。例如英國由於新加坡淪亡而陷於窘境時，以勞動階級為中心的反政府機運即刻昂揚，以致邱吉爾內閣曾兩次瀕於崩潰的危機。從那個時　起，經同年夏秋間的印度叛亂，以至十一月的北非登陸止，正是英國內閣飽嘗這次大戰中最大舌難的時期，這種苦難，總算由於一味阿諛追隨勞動階級而挨了過去。</p>
<p>這就是說，一面將克里浦斯迎入戰時內閣，一面將展開第二戰綫的空頭支票開給蘇聯，並下令制成皮伐立治保險法案等等，確有以克里浦斯為中心而樹立「克倫斯基政權」的模樣，但一待彈壓印度，及北非登陸成功後，邱吉爾即改變態度，於登陸北非後不到十日，即將克里浦斯擠出戰時內閣，而邱吉爾大聲疾呼地喊道：「余並非為淸算大英帝國而　首相印綏者！」也是在北非登陸成功前後的事。十二月初旬，在勞動階級對於工資頗多期待之間，發表即時實施皮伐立治案，因而關於應該拒絕即時實施的條項抑或要求延期實施的問題，　起勞動階級內部的對立。這樣，邱吉爾分化勞動階級的工作是成功了。不過，不滿政府的勞動階級因此頗有急進的傾向，所以隨着戰爭的發展，尤其是對蘇關係的推移，英國勞動階級的動向如何，殊難預斷。</p>
<p>內閣的右翼化</p>
<p>邱吉爾為對抗此種情勢而取的措置，其最堪注意者，即係內閣的右翼化。最近兩次的內閣改組，業巳在戰時內閣中確立保守黨的絕對優勢，右翼化的傾向彰彰明甚。和內閣右翼化相關且為我們所不得忽略者，就是英國的上層階級嘴裏雖高喊打倒法西斯主義，而實際上他們自己却一路向法西斯主義前進。揚棄十九世紀式民主主義而採用新民主主義的主張，已成英國今日正在生長中的新觀念。所謂新民主主義者，其內容即係獻身國家，統制經濟，及由此而生的社會政策等，顯然具有法西斯主義理想的過渡產物的特　。保守黨理論家卡敎授曾論斷希特勒和新民主主義的關係，聲稱頗與用武力傳播自由主義福音的拿破侖，和自由主義的關係相似。至於最近開放英國法四斯主羲巨魁摩士勒，理由雖說是患病不宜再行監禁，但和這種傾向怕也不是全然無關的吧。</p>
<p>這樣，目前英國勞動階級雖然易起分化，但勞動階級的急進化總是戰時的顯著現象，因而在這次大戰中，必將意起前次大戰時所不能比擬的大規模的國內鬥爭。這樣的觀察，大約不致錯誤。</p>
<p>美國對英略奪</p>
<p>比以上各種威脅更可長怖的，便是美國的吞噬計畫，今日正在暗地進行中。在資力方面，在海空路方面，在軍力方面，英國是完全被美國壓倒了。大英帝國的各個要衝都建立了美國的基地，大英帝國已被編入美國國防體系內了。美國參加戰爭的目的之一。即為「繼承大英帝國的遺產」。這巳是盡人皆知的常識。惟具體上以何種形式而行之，則是頗為微妙的問題。現在，美國的對英態度即巳現出種種異相。第一，有大胆無忌的立刻合併英國論。第二，則為近來在有力方面成為問題的美英同盟論。這是共和黨最有力的繼統候補人紐約知事裘伊所主張的。第三，則是威爾基的態度，即：　排除英國為支持羅斯福總統而干涉美國政治；　批評頑固的英帝國主義；　重視蘇聯甚於英國。第四，尤為特異，即戰前的孤立派現在已成「防衛帝國主義派」了，他們以防衛美國為口實，對英出以「謀財害命」的强盜態度。例如他們雖亦主張予日本以最强烈的打擊，但對英國也得寸進尺地竊取英國的基地，資源，領土等。</p>
<p>然而，美國當局的對英態度卻更為陰險，蓋就大局着想，立即分解英帝國，對於美國的國防及支配世界的企圖，頗有引起很大的不利和混亂之懼。所以表面上盡可能支持英帝國，而略地裏則逐漸囂食英國的領土權益。例如關於印度問題。因為威爾基似乎抱着偏袒印度國民會議派的態度，美國當局便禁止他進入印度。美國常局之所以如此，其理由即在於本維特英帝國的前提而支持英國的對印政策。結果，美國當局現在的方針如能順利推行，則正如今日英國之支配其自治傾及其他屬領，美國將來不亦可以支配英國嗎？</p>
<p>蘇聯的威脅</p>
<p>最後要論及援英勢力，便是蘚聯，蘇聯和美國的對英關係之間，頗多極有興味的異同之點。茲將蘇聯援英要素的異同比較如下：</p>
<p>美國的援英出於自動，蘇聯的援英則在於續對德抗戰。</p>
<p>美國關懷英國屬領，蘇聯則注意英國本部。所以當蘇聯發揮其對英「半敵性」本質時，英國便將陷入最大的危險中，蓋美國的武器以財力為主，而蘇聯則利用思想上的力量。</p>
<p>對英「半敵性勢力」的美國，企圖一面維持大英帝國，一面逐漸將其攫為己有，但蘇聯的敵性程度更强，頗有運用紅色觸手粉碎英本國及英帝國的可能性。</p>
<p>英國之憂慮蘇聯進出歐洲，是我們所知道的，而關於波蘭，巴爾幹及其他東南歐問題，中歐問題，地中海問題等，現在已有悉為蘇聯攻勢所勝之形，常此以往，英國將無立錐之地。英國目前雖未出以有效的對蘇反攻，且儼然以美蘇調停者自居，但在英國的政策中，早已有暗示改變對蘇態度的充分要素存在，恐怕在實我第二戰綫的　間，即將明白表演出來吧。至於程度及形式如何，固然多半須受當時情勢的支配，但是，如果英國的態度改變得厲害，那　蘇聯的反攻也强·英國爲了有效對抗蘇聯起見，不論是否願意，恐怕部不得不更深入美國的庇護之下，而成爲美國野心的犧牲。</p>
<p>綜觀上述，英國雖為保存自己而拚命掙扎，但在這種掙扎中，「半敵性勞力」卻着着得勢，結果終將不免為其囂食吞　。</p>
<p>激化武力威脅</p>
<p>另一方而，自外部加諸英國的軍事威脅本身，也不許英國對其前途樂觀。東西軸心現在雖似採取守勞為基本戰略，但在守勞中也舍着攻勢，而其攻勞的銳鋒，不論是德國或日本，都一致　向大英帝，着其作為共同目標。例如德軍現於主要戰場東綫採取守勞，一面繼續强力的反攻，一面又時行大規模的撤退，但在這種整理東部戰綫的舉動中，却含有實行對英報復轟炸及其他對英本土攻勢的可能性，這是反軸心軍事專家所承認的，希特勒總統在前次納粹起義紀念日的演說中也明白地宣稱：「我們縱然不能到達美國……但一個國家是在我們可以到達的距離內的，我們將斷然行之。」這句話當然是對英國說的。另一方面，東亞的日本在今日的主要戰塲也取守勞的攻勢，然在日本的守勢中含有偉大的攻勢，也十分明顯。例如英印軍司令歐慶萊克低喚緬甸攻勞不可能，而印度臨時政府主席鮑斯却高喊「進擊德里」。德國的目標是大英帝國的本據，日本的目標則為大英帝國的支柱印度。語云：「皮之不存，毛將焉附」，英本國一倒，自然不會再有英屬印度，但印度如果離背，則英帝國亦將喪失其實體。</p>
<p>固然，何時採取對英決戰的最後攻勢，現在我們是無從窺其端倪的。但束四軸心的重大目標之一皆在打倒大英帝國，則的確是頗饒興味的事。目前，能否擊碎反軸心大攻勞，以及打倒英帝國是否能夠成功，似已成爲這次大戰勝負的關鍵了。（喜多村特派員）（吉：譯自十一月二十八日讀　報知）</p>
<h3 id="c58">水雷戰隊　開拓補給路線　—完成非任務的任務— <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>我們艘內火艇，在艇尾上飄揚着軍艦旗，而在忙於準備出　的水雷戰隊中間，由這一艘軍艦划駛到另一艘軍艦。當靠近舷側時，即有年靑軍官一個兩個地從艇裏向軍艦扶梯而上，我們看着攀梯而上的士官們後影，高聲喊着再見！一路保重！而右手揮動着帽子。艇一離開舷側，則暫得少微住手休息的水兵們，也響應我們的離別，全都曾拚命地揮動着艦內帽。最後，我們的艇則順在驅逐艦〇〇號的舷側了。此次是該我們被送了。擦着汗的內火艇艇員說：</p>
<p>—將來該艦入港時，我們首先迎接你們去。這是一艘最吉祥的艦。自從瓜達卡那爾戰　以來，不知曾出征過多少次，但總是平安而歸，所以這次也一定不要緊。</p>
<p>—好吧，再見！多蒙關照了！</p>
<p>—那末，祝你們一路平安！</p>
<p>祈禱對方馬到成功這樣一路平安的字句，對於被送者，眞是深深地刻鑲在心板上。送客者的眞　熱情，完全流露在裏面，眞是找不出其他更好的話來。</p>
<p>爬到〇〇號驅逐艦上來一看，艦內無處不在忙碌着。在這一艘艦上，有將派往〇〇島去的陸軍士兵，有補充第一綫部隊的物品，有夾雜在中間而穿來穿去的水兵，於是甲板上看着是滿滿的。陸軍士兵們都很小心牠，盡量不要作出妨礙他人的事，在砲塔的後面和在通風筒的傍面，左一夥右一羣地在談等着。從艙裏飄浮出來一種汗奧和皮革奧、眞是軍艦從未有過的奇腥異奧。水兵們跑到陸軍士兵傍邊，似乎非常親熱的在交談着什麽話，還在關照着他們。</p>
<p>瞭望海面</p>
<p>在艦橋上，正是艦長〇〇中校和航海長〇〇上尉把羅盤針放在海圖上，在研究航路。瞭望兵雙手把着細筒式大的望遠鏡，雖然滿項頭上湧流着黃豆粒般的汗珠，但仍然緊精會神地在瞭望着，這個地方，不知怎麼，非常的寂靜。頓導着我們走的先任將校說：</p>
<p>—艦長！對於搭乘者，都收容好了。</p>
<p>—啊，辛苦，辛苦！那末這就添油，按預定時間準備出港吧！通信長，用信號通知〇〇！</p>
<p>然後艦長敏捷地發出命令，即行拔錨向給油船前進，艦長終於到我們面前來，道着歉及擦着汗說</p>
<p>我們的艦這次到〇〇處去，是第〇次，但這次是打算駛入〇〇灣的中間看看的。據說敵方飛機在港口散佈着機雷，也許不會出毛病。明天早晨〇時到達布英，到〇〇，也許就在晚上〇時左右了。〇〇地方的瘧疾非常猖獗，要加小心！那末這就是我的歡迎詞了。到士官室去喝汽水去吧！</p>
<p>因為是出港的時間，所以艦長好像非常的忙。從艦橋向下走的時俟，看到先任將校，艦長作着操舵的手勞，說這眞好。艦長說，給大家講講，前次同一〇〇運輸，而受到敵機轟炸的時候，看到黑粒般的炸彈脫離敵人飛機，而巧妙轉舵時的情形。先任將校說，此次也許還來，只要還是同一位艦長就不要緊。把敵人的炸彈脫過三十左右公尺，而落入海中時，那眞是有說不出來的痛快。先任將校這樣說着，表示着非常信賴艦長的那副神情，向我們望着。</p>
<p>我們的艦，不如不覺地業已橫擺在給油船傍了，從粗大橡皮管（Hose）裹咕嚕咕咯地吸飲着重油。太陽逐漸傾斜到西面，而今天早晨出擊去的海軍飛機，排着整齊的隊伍歸來。即根據瓜達卡那爾島倫家岬附近有敵方船隊集中的消息，而去出擊的航空隊剛剛囘來了。在編隊裏缺少一架或兩架的，那也許是自爆機吧！雖然戰鬬是家常便飯，但今天却好像特別厲害。海軍飛機在我們的艦上，隆隆作響着，一架，兩架地落地了。</p>
<p>昨夜我們曾感覺到在陸地上有强烈的地震。地愈震動的厲害，則戰爭也愈激烈。這是在敵方於倫特巴島登陸的〇日前，〇〇號驅逐艦和其他友艦一同，深入敵方制空權下的地方去出擊的。傾刻間，該艦輕輕地搖擺着出動了。無論艦長，也無論士兵，從此全都將夜以繼日，處於不眠不休的狀態裏了。不僅要和敵方飛機作鬬爭，和敵方潛水艇作鬬爭，同時還要和滿是珊瑚礁的水路作鬬爭，此後只是用〇〇海里的速度航行着，默默地禱告着，必須完成〇〇任務，即將展開大的作戰。太陽沉入海底，而附近全都黑暗起來，送艦行者，只有瞭望臺上信號燈的點點火光。</p>
<h3 id="c59">突入敵方制空圈 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>驅逐艦之為物，原來也是這樣受苦的麽？所羅門海，都說是風平浪靜的，但實際上也是顚簸很大的。終於不耐煩，而就鑽入先任將校所幫忙打開的板架的床裏，就在耳邊聽到有衝我們軍艦的波浪的聲音。非常像老虎吼叫的「吭」的厲害聲音。又加上非常熱，自己使不拘禮節地完全脫光，但全身像泡在水裏一樣的，汗在不斷地流着。不久嘔吐了一次，自己輾轉反側不能入睡的當兒，我們的軍艦又提高了速度。時時在甲板上有波浪打上來的聲音，艦體上發出嘩嘩的聲音。正當子夜時分，喉嚨發乾，就走到士官室傍的廚房去，那邊的主計兵（即廚役兵）在濛濛的熱氣裏，流着像泉瀕的汗，在佇立着。</p>
<p>這個地方不知要比我睡的地方熱多少倍，為了頂備搭乘的陸軍士兵的早飯，主計兵就這樣在艦上，通夜在作着比平常多數倍的飯。</p>
<p>士官室裏當然沒有人在。航海長，通信長，砲術長，一定全都在艦長的傍面執行自己的任務。想到這一點，便覺得在這艘軍艦上逍遙自在，無思無慮地睡覺者，只有我吧！這有點太過份了。自己在駡着自己說，這是戰爭呵！又好像要嘔吐的樣子。到了晚上，一位商船學校出身的航海長便對我說：</p>
<p>——今天晚上如睡不着，就請到艦橋上來玩吧！如天氣好，縱令是夜裏，或許也可以看見波根維爾島的巴葛諾火山吧！</p>
<p>雖然這樣約會我，但我道個樣子，委實也走不到艦橋去。所謂巴葛諾火山，對於我們的海軍飛行號是司空見慣，無足爲奇了。從〇〇基地起，僅僅經過〇〇時問，在雄糾糾去出擊的我們海軍飛行員的眼廉裏，這個火山汹湧地冒着烟雲，也許是極其美麗的。有一位航空隊的士官曾過：</p>
<p>——在接到命令後未上飛機前，的確情緒有點緊張，但一起飛，就什麼都忘記了。因為周囘過於美麗，自己總是想，就是這樣死掉，融化於大自然裏，也很覺不錯。所以當在出擊去的飛機裏，眞是心曠神怡，自己覺得眞是High　King。尤其是把主計兵費盡心血作好的飯盒打開，吃着美味的飯，喝着淸香的茶，瞭望着五顏六色，千嬌百奸的景緻，實有說不出的美感。</p>
<p>死的哲學</p>
<p>擁抱着魚雷，向敵艦進行衝接的攻擊機，也許是一件寫意的事。這位士官只是在我們上面更高的階段空中，把自己死的哲學和美的自然連結到一處，倒是一件達觀的署法。雖然如此，但於南海上美麗的夜色裏，進行水雷戰隊單縱航進的一剎那，却不得不暈船而嘔吐的自己，眞是十足表現了可憐相。</p>
<p>在艦橋更高的桅杆上，坐在水兵們稱作鳩菓的圓吊桶裏，默默擔任瞭望的士兵們，也許抱着那位航空隊士官同樣的感觸吧！同時，雖然是夜裏，但一分一秒也不能對空瞭望疏忽的士兵，在望遠鏡裏注視着星星的熒熒光暉，那種神情，也一定超越死的觀念了。我們的艦，熄滅了一切的燈光，只是一直向戰鬥的海洋驀進。在這樣美麗的緊張氛圍裏，我們的艦，雖然是在敵方潛水艇出沒無常的地方，但並未遇到，於〇時，在布英近海處入港了。</p>
<p>在白色皚皚的砂灘上，點綴着堆堆撮撮的椰子林，星星點點的Mangiore（一種熱帶常綠樹）的繁茂樹枝，甚至下垂到海面，在背後，迢　而　立雲端的塔羅加山，看着非常的險竣，但我們的陸上部隊，完全像迷失了路途的羔羊一樣，不知這是什麽所在。先任將校跑來說</p>
<p>——睡着了麽？我少微眨了一眼，你怎樣！</p>
<p>這位士官，以及在甲板上所碰到的所有士官，所有的水兵，昨夜差不多全朱能入眠，他們的眼睛上全都掛着血色。眼皮雖然看着有點臃腫，但大家都好像不知道痰倦一樣，在來囘操作着。因為我們的艦業巳椗泊，所以非値班的水兵們，便在甲板的背後面，舖着一張草墊，像蝦一樣彎曲着身體，鼾聲大起地睡着了。</p>
<p>從友艦上放下內火艇來，商量要公的士官坐着艇艇來會見我們的艦長。根據敵方的情報，必須計劃航路，速度以及通過各水路的作戰方針。</p>
<p>事實上，軍艦中頂忙碌的，是艦長。也許今天夜裏又誰也不能睡了。所羅門的島嶼，多半都是不毛之地。最不好的地方，甚至水，也必須用船運。於是，彈藥，當然一切糧秣也在內，都必須依賴後方補充。然而深入敵方制空區內，為了完成這一運輸任務，則必須夜間行動，早展退出敵方制空圈外。能夠執行這樣任務者，捨驅逐艦莫屬。</p>
<p>因此，水雷戰隊所擔任的任務，乃並非自己原來的任務之運輸。所以自從敵人在倫特巴島登陸以來，雖然沒看到有足堪稱述的大戰，但却進行着大陸戰綫上所不能看到的補給戰，在這樣地方是具有生死的重要性，且經常不變的日夜進行着戰爭（。石岩譯自十一月廿四日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c60">英軍戰敗加憶錄 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 李海波</p>
<p>在這裏記載的一文，是前馬來英軍司令官巴希伐爾中將的戰敗回顧錄，足以證明日軍作戰能力的優秀，遠非英軍　及。</p>
<p>馬來作戰，是日軍捨身進擊，發揮其民族精神的作戰，英國在馬來一帶，　百年苦心，築成銅墻鐵壁的防綫，而日軍勇猛作戰，轉戰於縱橫千百公里的廣大戰區，毫無倦色。敗軍之將巴希伐爾當日軍開　之時，立刻動員分佈於馬來四大軍管區的英，印，澳大軍，努力從事防守戰，但是終因抵不住如怒濤洶湧的日本軍突破作戰卒告全軍崩漬，矢盡刀折，一敗塗地，向稱難攻不落的新加坡要塞，終於揭起了白旗屈服。</p>
<p>巴希伐爾把這一次失敗的經過，記述得非常淸楚，分為十四章，據他的記載說，在諸戰中奪取古打巴爾飛機塲，在萊達戰綫佐伯部隊的突破齊德拉防綫，斯利摩河的激戰，在摩阿河渡河作戰中五反田戰車隊的奮鬥，新加坡的戰鬥，日方航空部隊的活躍等，對於英軍給予重大威脅，乃成英軍投降的重大因素，以上這些事實，都在敵將的筆下描寫出來。</p>
<p>英軍初期的配備</p>
<p>英軍初期的配備，考慮到以下三點：</p>
<p>新加坡島的防禦　　適宜於登陸作戰的海岸綫防禦　　聚機塲的防禦。在北部方面，這些飛機塲有二個主要部份，其一為吉蘭丹地區，另一個就是吉打州威爾斯里地區，由於以上觀點，馬來軍管區就分為以次四個管區，　新加坡要塞地區，歸基希門司少將指揮，又要塞，步兵隊及移動部隊，亦歸其統轄。　澳大利亞軍。歸貝納得少將指揮負責柔佛，麻六甲防禦事宜。　印度第三軍團，歸希斯中將指揮，擔任柔佛北部及麻六甲全境的防務，印度第三軍團，是由印度第九，第十一師團配合起來的，其配備區城如次：</p>
<p>印度第九師團（配有力旅團於吉關丹地區，配一旅於關丹地區）印廣第十一師團（齊德拉南方一旅團（北部吉打州）巽開巴太一旅團，怡保一旅團）。</p>
<p>對空防禦側重於新加坡防衛上，歸馬來軍司令部直轄。北部地區移動防空隊，歸印度第三軍團指揮。</p>
<p>日本軍的開始攻擊</p>
<p>在日本軍開始攻擊之前，我方參酌一般的國際情勞，先巳有了萬全的防禦，十二月七日節晚，我航空機在星哥拉海面約七十英哩附近，發見日本護航船團，方知準備巳經竣事，擔任吉蘭丹防務的該地區守備隊的目的，在於確保為我方飛機使用的飛機塲，上項地區，以守備隊擔任防禦，未免太廣大了，但是相信守備隊一定可以阻止最初的日軍攻擊，給予日軍相常的損害，嗣後日軍的攻擊進展，而且飛機塲因為經過日本空軍的猛炸而不能使用，我方飛機遂不得已而澈退。</p>
<p>在這種狀態之下，我方航空隊遂無死守此飛機塲的理由，吉打戰錢部隊，於十二月八日晨，接到開調齊德拉防綫的命令，得悉日軍在星哥拉登陸，偵察機隊也被派出動，同時在克洛霍的日軍部隊，奉命進覓取有利的陣地。</p>
<p>吉蘭丹撤退</p>
<p>到了十二月十一日，關於在吉蘭丹的部隊之任務有予以決定的必要，鑒於該地飛機塲的不能使用，一方面循西海岸南下的敵方全力的攻擊，愈益明顯，於是決定撤退吉關丹的部隊。</p>
<p>在吉打的情勢</p>
<p>在開戰第一週未了的時候，吉打的戰况是極其危險，亳無作戰經騐的印度第十一師團，因受日軍的進繋，竟告後退，迅速的敗退與混亂的狼狽，將士及物質方面都受了相當的損害，而且吉打及格洛戰綫之間，有被中央突被的危險性，因之就決定了下面的辦法：</p>
<p>預備隊，印度第十二步兵旅團到威爾斯利地區，歸印度第三軍團指揮。　凡巳無法使用者，雖極少數的部隊，亦需要調到吉圢州去作戰，故放棄了檳榔的防備，又，在這種狀態之下最重要的，就是在馬來半島北部地方的航空勢力，必須保持絕對優勢，因為日本軍在泰國雨部配有不少戰鬥機的綠故。所以日本軍祇要攻擊沒有防空設備的檳榔，再監視了我軍的移動，就能搗亂我們的交通聯絡。</p>
<p>向霹靂北部的後退</p>
<p>得到印度步兵第十二旅團的援助，吉打及格洛兩地的聯絡，才得維持，到十二月八日左右，這個陣地雖然保持了克利陽河的一綫，但是在十二月八日之前，印度第十一師團已經蒙受相當損害，而成爲極其脆弱的部隊，一方面少數分遣隊，仍保持着格里克道，這一個地方因爲所受攻擊比較狹小，所以它是霹展北部的最好陣地，因為進擊格里克道的敵敵軍部隊，太平地區所在的部隊，遂有被切斷的危機，所以該處陣地的守備，也不過暫時性質而已，於是不得巳而退至霹靂河以東的陣地，這個陣地，並不是天然的良好陣地，水旱兩路並行，所以在旱路上的我軍通信聯絡機關等，常耍受到企圖渡過霹靂河的日軍之攻勢，又選定一個陣地，將其最前置於卡摩巴爾，此項陣地被還定的理由，是因為地形相當廣闊，能夠充分使用砲兵。</p>
<p>從關丹的撤退</p>
<p>十二月底左右，為守備關丹地方起見，預定有一個師團到來，儘可能長期確保關丹飛機塲是極重要的事，何以必須保全它呢，因爲假使一旦為日軍佔據，則立刻增加新加坡空襲的危險，一方面西海岸綫如被擊退，則與關丹的聯絡，即吿杜絕，當時對關丹並未直接攻擊，不過對於在丁加奴北方的輕易陣地，有若干接觸，從關丹撤退部隊的方法，因為傑蘭德方面的渡船收容力有限，故不得不徐徐撤退，為充常西海岸作戰起見，遂決定使此項部隊撤退，預定到一月中旬完成撤退任務，但是在撤退還沒有終了之時，日本軍就從北方來攻關丹飛機塲。</p>
<p>斯利摩河的戰鬬</p>
<p>到一月初旬，日本軍已幾完全確保了制空權及馬來西海岸的海上聯絡，對於我方通信的威脅，愈加重大，於是為監視本海岸起見，乃有配置着干砲兵隊編成特別部隊的必要，又派若干義勇軍及一·二部隊，從東海岸移動，雖然採取如此措置，但是日軍依然登陸，對於我軍通信聯絡的威脅，並未減少，反而右增，一月第一週的週末，日本軍在霹靂州南部斯利摩河之役獲得大勝，於是日本軍在此用戰車擊被了我方前綫的二個旅團，二個旅團兵員，配備都受了極大損害，一時幾無戰鬥部隊的效用，因此一役以及連續一月未休的戰鬥消耗，印度軍第十一師團，卒告無法保全喀拉·蘭玻爾北方的防衛陣地，又在　蘭　地區及其南方，有多數道路，而且從海上不斷右威脅，於是這一帶防禦更感困難了，乃決定撤退至後方柔佛地區之北，印度第九師團的撤退，也有和第十一師團採取同樣步驟撤退的必要。</p>
<p>北部柔佛的戰鬥</p>
<p>北部柔佛地區，本來也不是容易防守的地域，特別是對於握有海權的敵人之防禦，更其困難，其理由如次：</p>
<p>主要道路有二條，一條是吉隆坡道路，一條是海岸道路，還有一條可以移動的道路。</p>
<p>該處橡皮園極其發達，差不多每一個地域都能任軍隊移動通過，一方面因為茂新克爾恩巴德道路上，有着主要飛機塲，所以不得不在這個道路的北方作戰，為了在北部柔佛地域的作戰，故而在貝納德少將指揮之下，新設了西部軍的一軍，其編成是由澳洲軍（在茂盛的一個旅團隊）印度第九師團，印度第四十五步兵旅團（最近自印到達）配合起來，當初貝納德少將部下的配備如下：</p>
<p>澳洲軍及印度第九師團，駐紮於色茄瑪托北方陣地，又派少數兵力伏在金馬士北方陣地，　印度第四十五步兵旅團，在若干澳洲砲兵隊支援之下，担任海岸道路上摩阿渡河點的監視任務，柔佛殘餘地點，統由第三印度軍指揮，其司令部設在新金山，其所轄部隊，一律從事後方工作，　以茂盛地區的一旅澳軍，在金馬士方面與緊迫我軍的日軍發生接觸，我軍伏兵部隊，獲得甚大效果，相信有數輛日軍戰車及大隊日軍陷於無法戰鬥狀態，但是這個時候，循海岸道路進擊的日軍部隊，巳在摩阿河渡河成功，進攻在摩阿河地區防守的我軍，為了支援印度第四十五步兵旅團起見，故而派遣大隊澳軍前往就是從色茄瑪托撤退與從茂盛地區撤退下來的兵力），後來又加派最近到達的第五十三步兵旅團（第十八師團）的一大隊，着其防守榮本西方的高地，印度第六，第十五混成旅團，着其自居變移動到巴德柏哈，因為後方道路閉塞，我方摩阿地區防備軍的聯絡已被切斷，所以在色茄碼托地區尙在交　中的主力部隊，直接感受威脅，遂即下令該部隊中止與敵方接觸，立刻自居　，埃爾希登陣地後退，此項行動進行順利，全數部隊，僅受極少數損害，安全退出，新的配備大概如次：</p>
<p>（A）印度第九師團的一個旅團，配駐於居　，澳洲軍配駐於埃爾希登，在移茹摩地區的印度第九師團的一旅，作為上項部隊的預備隊，以上部隊，統歸貝納德少將指揮國。</p>
<p>（B）印度第十二師團，將其先遣部隊駐紮於巴德柏哈，分配在海岸道上，澳軍一旅，仍在茂盛地區，以上部隊，爲第三印度軍團指揮，爲使新加坡減少空襲危險起見，所以死守居　飛機塲，不讓日軍奪去是最爲重要，因之下令：該地區的戰鬥要儘量拖長。</p>
<p>恩樓的登陸</p>
<p>在這個時候，有少數日軍在恩樓作小規模的登陸，我空軍雖曾攻擊其船舶，但已經是日軍登陸之後的事了，日本軍向茂盛前進，與該處設有陣地的澳軍交戰，日軍進展並不太速，所以似乎不感到威　。</p>
<p>巴德，柏哈附近的戰鬥</p>
<p>約一週問，第六，第十五旅團，為了防護居　及埃爾希登防衛軍的左翼，故在巴德·柏哈繼續作戰，巴德·柏哈·埃爾希登之間的道路被閉基之後，該部隊所能使用的唯一交通路，祗有取這海岸道路，一月二十六日左右，連得到倫基德後方的主要道路也被切斷，第六，第十五旅團的突破封　綫企圖，終告失敗，所以該旅團不得已而故棄其大部份輜重及配備，將士分水睦兩路退却，因為海岸道路　塞另外已經沒右可以使用的部隊，假如日本軍　該道路南下、則在居　，埃爾希登作戰中的全部友軍勞必被日軍切斷，因此決定將柔佛州作戰中的部隊，在一月的最後一週間，全部退至新加坡島，這個撤退工作，在一月三十一日之前完成，除了喪失印度第九師囤的印度第二十二步兵旅團之外，其他都告成功，原來印度第二十二步兵旅團分駐在倫茹摩南方的鐵逍附近，以致不能與總隊取得聯絡，大部為日軍所俘。</p>
<p>新加坡島防禦</p>
<p>在戰爭爆發之前，就集中全力於防禦新島海岸，但是北部沿岸未有絲亳防禦工事，雖然在戰鬥期間儘量從事此項防禦　施，可是終究太遲，直到退出新加坡的時候，其防禦工程尙不完全。部隊配備如次：</p>
<p>澳洲軍：統率有印度步兵第四十四旅團（最近自印度到來），駐紮在包括海峽橋的該島之四部地區，　第三印度軍團；隣接澳洲軍，駐　在包括羗契的北部地區。該軍團部下，有印度第十一師團（經過改編後的）為其左異，第十八師團（其殘部最近到達新加坡）為其右異　南部地區，包括羗契的島之南部地區及蒲關馬脫伊勃來丁與奔吉蘭）的防禦，一般防禦計劃，因為要對於企圖渡過柔佛水道的部隊給予重大損害起見，所以把前哨配在海岸，在其內部選定防禦抗戰的據點，準備了俟機反攻的預備隊，各部隊長都奉到了命令，如果接得隣接部隊的要求，為援助其起見，即當派遣頂備隊前往</p>
<p>在新加坡的戰鬥</p>
<p>日軍集中砲火於島的東北部，企圖使我們的視綫移轉到該方面，可是我軍的搜索隊，接得報告，知這日軍有力部隊正集中於與東北部相反的地區，那當然會料到日軍要在西北沿岸登陸，不管他第一次登陸是否實施，澳洲軍及馬來軍司令部，先把頂備隊派到丁加地區，為保守　岩，都倫間的一部份佈置就緒的陣地起見，傾注了一切的努力，二月十日（星期二）決計把從第十八師團中抽調出來的部隊來加强這些兵力，到同月十一日（星期三）朝晨止，喪失了擁有大隊預備兵力的蒲基台馬村及跑馬廳，用盡千方百計，好容易使阿達摩。羅德附近的陣地安然無恙到同月十二日（星期四）不得已而從北部地區後退。遭就是第十八師團。又印度軍第十一師團·從海軍根據地地區撤退，　　及東南海岸地區部隊也告撤退，這個退却，是十二日（此期四）晚上的事情，於是到十三日（星期五），在新加坡市周圍的加　飛機場，維他太利，馬克里契　水池，阿達摩。羅德，亞歷克遜多拉各地一帶，築起了陣地，十四日（星期六）因為空襲及砲擊，輸水管及水道管遭受破壞，故對於新加坡的給水，感受困難，到了十五日（星期五）早晨，補給狀况，益為逼迫，據水道專家稱，祗有一週夜給水的可能，這就是決定十五日投降的最大原因。</p>
<p>空中狀况</p>
<p>在這個囘顧錄裏，關於空中狀况，差不多沒有述及，因為這個狀况，不但是英軍，就是日本方面也很明顯的了，因為英國在其他塲所的任務關係，所以不能調派必嬰的空軍勢力到馬來，於是，日本軍最初頭上數天，就得到了制空權，而且這個制空權一直保持到現在，始終沒右失掉。這對於我們實在是一個極大的影響，尤其是在海岸作戰，要發動不讓敵人知道的行動，竟告不可能以致有許多塲合，受了攻擊，就是在新加坡地城的行動，也同樣受了嚴重的影響，使飛機塲的修理工作或則船　的工作等大感困難。</p>
<p>註：空軍因為是由陸軍中立起來的，所以關於空軍的事項，並無加以申述的地位。</p>
<p>日本軍的勝因</p>
<p>造成日本軍勝利主因的進兵神速，照我想是因為左列原因所凑成的；</p>
<p>日本軍在這個地方，有比較英軍軍以長期居住的可能。</p>
<p>日本軍在道路交通方面都有幫助。</p>
<p>日本軍具有迅速通過障碍物（即如河川，沼地等等）及迅速修復被　物的機敏與毅力。</p>

<h3 id="c61">日美交涉決裂的責任 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>兩年以前的十一月二十六日，日美兩國的關係事實上就已顏於破裂的境地。當日。美國向日本野村。來栖兩代表　出最後的提案。那無一是一份美國對日實戰的哀的美教書，事後連他們自巳的一部份人士也直認不　。在一九四三年一月。美國國務院發行了一本小册子，題為「和平與戰爭」（一九三一—一九四一年的美國外交政策），詳述十年來的美國外交政策，特別是日美關係和日美交涉決裂的「真相」。美國政府當局之所以公開刋印此書，其目的顯然是向國內外表明他們在日美交涉中的「公正立塲」，欲將戰爭挑釁者的責任和罪　轉線日本，然而在洋洋數千書的字裏行間，反將當時美國對日的挑戰態度，如意算盤，以及一面　嚇一面懷柔的政策暴露無遣，這怕是他們所始料不及的吧。將小冊子全本介紹於此，限於篇幅，殊屬困難。茲特抉出眩書第十二　及第十四章關於日美交涉部份的二。三點，以據美國的欺騙瞞蔽。</p>
<p>美國缺乏交涉誠意</p>
<p>第一可以注意的，便是美國最高當局從最初起就絲亳沒有成立交涉的希望和誠意。換言之、他們祇在藉此拖延開戰的時期，以期完成本國作戰的準備，釀成民衆擁護開戰的情緒。茲引用如下各節以明此說之不驟。</p>
<p>一。「大總統以下陸。海。國務各部院首腦，艦於目前美國的一般輿論，及軍事準備尙未充分等情，關於使美國捲入戰爭實較採取對日經濟方策尤欠妥善之點，意見完全一致」。（五十八頁，第十二章）</p>
<p>「註」美國政府首腦部至中日事變勃發一年後的一九三八年六月止，為何對日禁輪的理由，巳不打自招了。</p>
<p>二。「駐日大使格魯於一九四○年九月十二日，向本國政府具申意見如次：</p>
<p>「在英國歐戰成功以前，美國若能維持太平洋的現狀……由是美國乃有調整全太平洋問題的可能。」（六十二頁，第十二章）</p>
<p>（註）所謂「調整」者，即屈服日本之謂，係美國式的外交辭令。</p>
<p>三。「一九四一年春，日美交涉開始前，羅斯經總統和赫爾國務卿交換意見的結果，充分認識因日本的征服政策過趨極端，欲使日木停止其前進巳屬不可能的事實，故從有在束亞地區成立公正和平的協定之　，其希望亦其經渺微小。（註：此指野村大使履任後披瀝日方關於開始交涉的眞顰態度之事實）</p>
<p>美國政府關於似可提入正式會談的各基本間題，為確定能否充分協定計，不得不同意開始預備會談。」（七十七頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>（註）從這叙　中覓取美國維持太平洋和平的希望和誠意。是不可能的。</p>
<p>四。關於近衛。羅斯福會談問題的折衝—</p>
<p>日方提議</p>
<p>「一九四一年八月廿八日，近衛首相由日本大使轉交羅斯福總統如左的文書：</p>
<p>「繼續非正式預備會談，由兩國負責首腦確認其結論的辦法，實不適合可勃發意外事件的現狀之必要，故此際兩國政府首腦者從大局討論日美間關於整個太平洋的各種問題而會晤。實應必要。」（八十三頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>美方答覆</p>
<p>「同日（註：八月廿八日）會談中，赫爾國務卿向野村大使指摘如次：「美國希望於近衛。羅斯福會談以前，先成立關於主要問題的原則協定，　首腦會談歸於失敗時，其結果殊為重大。故此種會談的目的，應預有變方意見一致的重要點。」（八十四頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>考慮日方提議時，美國政府留意以下各種事實，即：近衛首相係一九三七年中日事愛勃發當時的日本首相……出席首腦會談的日本最高當局係一九三一年以來執行日本政策的負責者……會談從能達到原則上的諒解，日本會依其自己的解釋而行動，亦屬意中事……會談倘若失敗，日本將歸其實任於美方。」（八十四—八十五頁，第十四章）（註）由此可知美國為阻撓交涉，不惜每事吹毛求疵的心理。</p>
<p>美國主張的面面觀</p>
<p>第二點須指出來的便是日美交涉中的美國主張，是以傲岸不遜的見地為出發點的，而他們這些主張或用恐嚇的言辭和利誘的態度，或向被告人信口胡言而表明出來，並恬然將它分開發表。茲以交涉最大難關的日德意三國同盟條約，自中國及印度支那撤兵問題，及國際通商均等問題為中心，引用玆書原文如左：</p>
<p>一，美國對三國條約的態度</p>
<p>「一九四一年五月十一日，赫爾與野村大使會談時聲明如次：</p>
<p>「美國深知希特勒主義對於歐洲固不消說，即對其餘的世界，亦係一種禍患。不寗唯是，美國並確信日本與信頓希勒總統的歐洲各國相同，於敢近的將來亦將　受其禍。」（七十七頁，第十四章）（註）這是離間日德的惡性干求。</p>
<p>「一九四一年七月二十三日，即日軍通駐法屬越南南部真後，韋爾士國務次官與野村大使會談時陳述如次：</p>
<p>「日本與維希政府間締結的協定，皆係德國以壓力加諸維希而成功的，所以日越協定不妨解為支持德國世界支配政策之物。」（七十九頁，第十四章）（註）於此正顯露美國對束亞情勢認識的淺薄。</p>
<p>一九四一年十一月十七日野村。來栖。羅斯福。赫爾會談席上，</p>
<p>「赫爾謂：日本如依然固執三國條約，則關於太平洋領域的任何協定，亦不能認為確係眞心誠意。希特勒開始向全世界過軍的結果，美國已昭危險中，故美國須迅即請求自衛措置。」（八十八頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>（註）在此語背後實巳隱伏對德開戰的決意。美國之所以干求日本背離三國條約，即怕德美戰爭勃發時日本根據三國條約對美宣戰，故欲在打倒德國以前使日本為旁觀者。</p>
<p>二。美國對於撤兵問題的主張</p>
<p>「本提案之意圖乃在外國軍隊從越南或中國全面撤退。當時駐華美軍的撤退事實上巳皆完竣（註：此指對日軍戰，將駐華美國陸戰隊全體撤退。移往菲律賓及其他地方的措置而言。）最後部隊的撤退亦在　時進行中。又，英顰亦從中國撤退究學（註：與美軍間一目的。）所以提　日本亦從中國和印度文那撤退陸。海。空各軍及　察。」（九十二夏。第十四章）</p>
<p>十二月一日野村。來栖。赫爾會談！</p>
<p>「赫爾稱。進駐越南之日軍實係南方地域的威脅。」（九十三頁。第十四章）</p>
<p>（註）擺所謂對日ABCD包圍陣的不是他們自己　？</p>
<p>一九四一年七月二十三日，野村。隶爾士會談席上！</p>
<p>「韋爾士國務次官稱：日軍之進駐越南南部，據日方脫明，用意祇在確保米及原料等，並為對抗某種國家所企圖的對日包圍政策，但目下野村。赫爾問過行中的交滲如能圓滿妥協，則日本將可獲得比佔領印度支那更大的經濟上的保證。況且美國的政策既非包圍政策，亦非威　日本的政策。」（八十頁。第十四章）</p>
<p>（註）這真是哄騙孩子似的强辯。</p>
<p>一九四一年八月十七日。與野村大使會談時，羅斯福手交的對日通牒！</p>
<p>「日本政府若本軍事支配或武力威脅鄰邦的政策乃至計劃，今後更有任何舉措時，則美國亦將即刻實行保衛本國權限與人民安全所認為必要的一切手段。」（八十頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>一九四一年三月八日，野村。赫爾會談　　—</p>
<p>「赫爾稱，現有爾三個國家在美國眼前組織陸，海軍，欲征服世界七大洋，以及所有通商航路和美洲以外的四大陸，日方是想美國拱手靜觀嗎？」（七十六頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>三。美國對於通商均等問題的態度</p>
<p>「日本雖力有遵守國際通商關係上無整別的原則，但本實上則拒絕放棄日軍佔領區內所得的特殊地位。」（九十頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>（註）然實際上日本會「希望實行本原則於世界各國，且表明順應共實現，努力適用於包含中國在內的太平洋的地械之旨，又闡明不排斥第三國在中國的任何公正的經濟活動。」十二月八日日本政府對美覺書）所以美方係故意歪曲日方的主張；此點殊無疑問的餘地。而且，美國對於在沉美主義的名義下繫斷獨佔美洲的事實，蘭於其門羅主羲則以如次的放肆說明試行間接的強辯。</p>
<p>一九四○年四月二十日日本大使。赫爾會談席上—</p>
<p>「赫爾講，美國的門羅主義與日本所稱的門羅主義，其間之差別猶如白之於黑，即美國的門羅主義僅係企圖保障自己物質上安全的手段，而日本則認為可適用於包括經濟，政治及社會目的等一切目的。」（六十頁，第十二章）</p>
<p>事實上的最後通牒</p>
<p>第三件値得注目的事，就是十一月二十六日的提案事實上乃是最後通牒，而且他們在無意中洩露日軍攻擊珍珠灣並非「打悶棍。」</p>
<p>一。一九四一年一月二十七日格魯大使向本國政府報告—</p>
<p>「現巳獲得各方情報，日本軍事當局巳擬定於日美發生糾紛時大規模奇　珍珠灣的計劃。」（七十六頁，第十四章。</p>
<p>二。同年十一月三日的格魯報告—</p>
<p>「就迄今發生的各種事件觀，實難贊許以通　上的禁輪手段可避免東亞戰事的見解……余之目的即在阻止誤斷日本沒有能力和美國從事「自殺戰爭」的　見，　此種錯誤判斷反可促使美國捲久戰過……日本頗有採取使日美戰爭不可　免的危險手段的可能，此可預見。」（八十七頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>三，十一月七日，赫爾國務　在閣議上雜告—</p>
<p>「赫爾國務卿於十一月七日在閣議時報告日美關係已面　大的危機，以及日本頗有隨時以武力發動新行動的可能性等。是以閣議關於我國得以即　頗應此種事態的發展，應由演說强調危急情勢這點。意見趨於一致。根據是項決定。海眾部長諾克斯遂於一九四一年十一月十一日發表演說，警告美國不獨須在大西洋採取自衛的非常手段，即在太平洋那方，亦巳面遇不吉的可能性。」（八十七頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>四，十一月十七日格魯報告—</p>
<p>「日本陸海軍有在不包括於中日事變範圍內的區域中展開雷擊攻擊的危險，我們必須嚴密警戒。。」（八十八頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>五，十一月廿五日及廿八日最高首領會議時的赫爾聲明。此項聲明適在美方發出最後通牒的前後。</p>
<p>「國務卿赫爾於十一月廿五日及廿八日的政府省腦會議上，强調日美關係的危機性質。據赫爾的意見，和日本成立協定的可能性事實是不存在的、他以為今日仍有日本出以新的武力行動之懼：美國現在應將保衛國家安全的問題移諸陸海軍手中，美國必須迅即樹立軍事防衛計劃。因為日本以奇應的要素為其戰略的核心，所以赫爾主張應該假定日軍將在許多地點同實行攻擊。」（九十二頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>六，十一月廿九日，赫爾與英國大使會見—</p>
<p>「赫爾於十一月二十九日和英國大使協議，聲稱：「美國和日本的外交關係事實上已經告終。問題現將移歸　海　當局。」（九十二頁—九十三頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>（註）調介　珠灣敗戰真相的大理　推事洛伯茲的報告書亦稱：「一九四一年十一月二十七日（註）。：即美國對日提出覺書的翌日）陸軍參謀總長馬歇爾會通告夏威夷陸軍區司令馬爾泰蕭脫中將稱，對日交滲已告決裂；同日。海軍作戰部長亦同樣通告太平洋艦隊司令金末爾，下令實施遂行戰爭任務的準備。」</p>
<p>美　英　的積極合作</p>
<p>最後必須提及的，就是關於英在對日攻勢上的積極合作。這是美國提議的，並且還因此創造「日本進出印度洋的大野心」之語。</p>
<p>一九四一年八月九日，赫爾。英大使會談席上—</p>
<p>「赫爾稱，日本行將以武力進出　個印度洋及與其相接的各大陸各島嶼，使中國陷於孤立，並伸其觸手於蘇彝士運河口，波斯灣　田地域及好望角地帶，其結果則在計畫封鎖通往英國本部的貿易錢和補給源。這樣大規模的行動，恐怕除德軍橫斷英法海峽以外，再沒有比它更有害於歐洲英國的防衛吧。……日本今後如更南進，則美英兩國政府當然應該即刻協議對付辦法。」（八十二頁，第十四章）</p>
<p>（註）羅斯福與邱吉實在大西洋上舉行第一次會談，決定對日攻勢的具體卞策以及所謂大西洋憲章，即在赫爾發表這席言論之後，而「威爾斯親王」號及「雷伯爾斯」號之駛往親加坡，則在這次羅邱海上會談之後。（吉：　自十一月二十四—二十五日諸賣報知夕刋）</p>
<h3 id="c62">實現全面和平之道 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 陸雲軒</p>
<p>如何實現全面和平？一言以蔽之，重慶能及時覺悟抗戰之非，毅然拋棄迷戀英美之抗戰政策，使中國境內的戰爭狀態終了，那末全面和平當然在最短期問就可迅速的實現了。但重慶為甚麼要倡書繼續抗戰呢？我們要實現全面和平，首先的非要將重慶抗日原素解剖一下不可，過去很多人論及重慶抗日筒題，因心中懷有一種拘束，因此把要說的隱歸不說，結果立論亦就不直率不充分了，此次申報記念復刋一周年公開徵文，無疑是我們發表意見之最佳機會，筆者站在中國國民立塲上說幾句話，是否之處尙有冀盟邦賢智加以政正與批判的。</p>
<p>中國一般知識階級對日發生惡感之原因，始於九一八滿洲事變，當時因情感衝動，心中懷有日本非籍滿洲事變　去東三省乎？滿洲事變以後，中國知識階級即誤解日本之對華政策，宣傳排日抗日政策不遺餘力，一般民衆因受宣傳之惑，由誤解而生懷疑，一二八淞滬與七七蔗溝橋中日事變，均係此種排日宣傳所釀成，目前重慶幕下宣傳以抗戰收復失地之知識階級，亦以滿洲事件作為唯一的宣傳目標，滿洲事件使中國知識階級不能澈底了解日本之這義所在，思想上影響頗大，因此成為重慶對日妥協之僵局，此為重慶倡言繼續抗戰重要原故之一。</p>
<p>日本實踐對華新政策後，重慶治下之抗日思想，本已逐漸動搖，最近中日同盟條約之簽盯，日本允於兩國間恢復全面和平戰爭狀態綫了時，撤去其派在中國境內之日本國軍隊，此舉對抗戰陣營，至少能增進許多對和平之新認識，重慶目前依賴外援作戰，極有淪為英美陣綫附庸的危機，內心的苦悶是毋庸　言的，但如果毅然的脫離反軸心陣綫，日本是否藉中國為盟邦，將中國成為日本之軍需庫乎？中國連年因戰禍所及，田疇為墟，如立即區處條理，招輯流亡，使民獲安居，恢復舊觀。殆非數年或數十年不為功，如果短期間實現了全面和平，對建設新中國自然是不遺餘力，日本是否會將統制與配給制度　擅的伸展到中國，以經濟束縛中國的自由經濟發展，重慶治下的民衆思想右上述的懷疑，因此不能袪除抗日的成見此係抗日原故之二。</p>
<p>重慶當局自始即認為民主協約陣綫必勝。過去垂將二年的大東亞戰爭，因日軍節節勝利，雖不免震驚，但在英美宣傳掩蔽下，對日軍所獲戰果之眞相殆不能完全瞭然，重慶方面之報紙對英美之　敗更加以掩飾，此雖一半因恐引起迷戀英美之民心動搖，然一半係受重慶美方宜傳顧問之壓迫，此種識敗為勝之宣傳，使重慶民衆不能認識日本軍隊作戰之雄偉，所獲戰果之奇特，因此抱有日本是否會被美國擊敗的必理、因美方之揑造消息及掩飾敗況，不獨使重慶民衆對全面和平運動裏足不前，更因此造成妄思英美勝利以收復失地之心理，在一般　衆盲目的迷戀下，抗日的心理亦就因此不能消失，此係抗日原故之三。</p>
<p>綜戳上述三端，吾人可知抗日係一思想問題，此種思想如不予以調整，宜揭大東亞共同宣言之精義，即不能收頂期之效果，不獨如是，吾人所期望之全面和平亦因重慶之抗日思想存在決不致迅速的可以實現，盟邦文壞宿將吉田東祜先生他的言論能非常洞澈中國人內心的痛苦，我們過去讀他的「日本之對華文化政策與中國知識階級」一文他說：「日本在中國知識階級的猜疑心尙很濃厚的當兒，强聒不舍地揭示「興亞理論」和日本人穿中國衣，吃中國萊，亂喊日華親善，越發的要使中國知識階級愼防日本」。他這種平心靜氣的話，很透澈的指出日本如不調整中國一般民衆的懷美思想，對宣揚中日共同協力建設新東亞，在效率上自不能期望太高，我們要實現全面和平，首先非要重慶拋棄抗戰政策不可，要重慶不抗戰第一要解決重慶民衆的思想問題，我們很誠摯的希望我們中國之友吉田東祜先生對本文第一第二兩點予以公開的答覆，至於第三點日本的宣傳，我們希望能伸展到重慶，以改正重慶民衆之懷疑思想。</p>
<h3 id="c63">實踐中日盟約　幾個基本條件 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 毛持平</p>
<p>中日兩國，　齒相連，自古巳有政治和文化上的往來；際此大東亞戰爭，決定勝敗之時，大東亞民族，危急存亡之秋，不用說，兩國更當聯合起來，共支大局，共圖生存。所以中日的聯盟，就是使兩國關係，更加密切，使中國的復興强盛，能更快實現的意思。但是　　條約上的詞句，如何艷美悅耳，人民的興奮，如何慷慨激昂，這不過是一種理想，要使成為　實，必須檢討下列各點：</p>
<p>語言的疏通</p>
<p>了解彼此的語言，作為溝通文化的武器，相親相愛的媒介。如果連言語都不通，根本就沒法使之文化交流。不能互相傳達意思，也就引不起感情的共鳴。所以了解彼此的語會，實為中日澈底合作的基本條件。而得能如大東亞會議所宣言，共同發掦束方古有的文化，以達到最高的目的。</p>
<p>現在中日兩圃，已悲痛以往的受愚弄，而覺悟應相親愛團結而一致對外了。所以言語的溝通，實為團結親愛的最基本的工作。還來兩國人民，熱心地對於彼此語言的硏究，眞是一種必然的，而又十分可嘉的現象。我想一個能了解日本語的中國人，或一個能明白中國話的日本人，他們一定會把以前腦海中錯誤的觀念除去，而體味到中國或日本的可愛和可敬的好感的。</p>
<p>經濟的提携</p>
<p>經濟提携，本來是聯盟國家應有的條件，在過去，大束亞是被盤踞着英美的勢力，經濟的侵略，把中國國民經濟權殘到衰落和危險的地步，造成全中國經濟的恐慌，把中國逼得氣喘汗流，漸漸走向沒亡的末路。</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭動發以來，盟邦以麗大的戰　力，一舉而把英美的惡勢力，淸除　盡，東亞巳純粹成為東亞人的東亞，而日本所希望的，也是中國所希望的中日經濟提携，也得到實現的機會了。中國是產業落後的國家，一切生產技術，生產方法，都未加以澈底的改良，還保存着原始的狀態，如欲經濟繁榮，生產發　，決不能一蹴而就，勞非倚藉他人的力量不可。盟邦是與英美並駕齊驅的先進國家，一切皆値得中國的　效，實為中國欲復興經濟的一位有力的伙伴。</p>
<p>中國的自強</p>
<p>中國因大東亞戰爭，巳從英美的壓迫下解放出來。更由盟邦道義的精神，而得置立自主的機會，中國應趁着目下的良機，　除舊習，努力自強，以創造新的生命，才不辜負盟邦熱烈的期望。況國府於一月九日，宜告參戰以來，巳正式向英美宣戰，成為爭取大東亞戰爭勝利的一員，我們決不能空口高嚷，應當以實力來作為戰爭的武器。</p>
<p>重慶的覺悟</p>
<p>整個東亞，已逮到解放的階段，只有重慶，還受着英美的迷惑，做着東亞的叛逆，不能來共同建設大東亞，這真是最可惜最遺憾的事。</p>
<p>渝方同胞的　草根啃樹皮、寬是為了什麼？他們犧牲的代價。又是什麼？他們也是我們中華民國的人民，他們聽到中日同盟條約的簽訂後，一定要覺悟到重慶已是無謂的抗戰，而中日同盟的成立，將為中國復興的保障、重慶抗戰的呼號，巳將繫不住人民的己經覺悟的心　。希望重慶早日嚝然覺醒。不再被英美的迷　所沉醉，共同來建設理想的大東亞，爭取大東亞最後的勝利。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Welcoming the Third Year of the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War! We commemorate this historically transformative war amidst the great victories in the South Pacific, which is not only cause for celebration but also assures us that this war will be swiftly and victoriously concluded!</p>
<p>China's participation in the war has also reached eleven months. During this period, we have repeatedly reflected in our writings to awaken a shared sense of urgency among the government and the people.</p>
<p>Today, we should certainly be enthusiastic about the Greater East Asia War. However, we must also engage in sincere self-reflection regarding our own cooperation in the war effort: First, what have we actually contributed since joining the war? Second, do we possess an unwavering belief in victory for the Greater East Asia War? The results of this reflection might make us ashamed because, frankly, we cannot confidently answer either of these questions. Nevertheless, for the sake of China's destiny and the destiny of Greater East Asia, we absolutely need to strengthen our belief and cooperate in the war. We would like to offer a few points regarding the challenges of the third year of the Greater East Asia War:</p>
<p>During the two years of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has mobilized everything for the war effort. As we begin this third year, we must shift away from emphasizing verbal propaganda and move towards a period of implementation and action. We must all realize the importance of practice. On the government's part, this means implementing wartime systems and policies. On the part of officials, this means leading the people by example and living a wartime lifestyle.</p>
<p>Cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is China's only path to independent survival. Therefore, based on China's destiny, securing victory in the Greater East Asia War is a must. The ultimate failure of the Chongqing regime, which relies on Britain and the United States, and the failure of fence-sitting are inevitable.</p>
<p>Cooperation in the Greater East Asia War must begin from the basics, especially strengthening our own country. How do we strengthen our country? First, the people should have the right to participate in politics, so that the people and the government are united as one. Second, the people's lives should be stable, and they should happily serve the country. Third, economic development should be advanced, and resources should be developed and utilized to the fullest extent. If we talk about cooperating in the war without these points, the result will inevitably be a repetition of past failures.</p>
<p>The prosperity of a country cannot be solely the responsibility of the government; the general populace must also take responsibility. The people should support the government's national policies on one hand and urge the government to reform politics and clean up corruption on the other.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the third year of the Greater East Asia War will be a year of decisive victory. We Chinese, on the one hand, must cooperate in striving for victory to fulfill our responsibility as a link in East Asia, and on the other hand, we must strengthen our national foundation to become a strong member of East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Wang Issues Speech Encouraging Citizens to Cooperate in Building Greater East Asia with a Spirit of Hard Work and Endurance <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Today, the 8th, is the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Chairman Wang of the National Government issued a special speech, pointing out the bright future of East Asia and encouraging the entire nation to cooperate in completing the war and building East Asia with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and diligence. At the same time, he strongly denounced the Chongqing side for willingly accepting the instructions of Britain and the United States and for being a rebel against East Asia. He called on the entire nation to rise up and drive them out. The text is respectfully recorded below:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has exerted its national strength to crush the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia. The recent Greater East Asia Declaration further demonstrates the bright future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I respectfully offer my greatest respect to the governments of our allies and to the officers and soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear who have worked hard to achieve unprecedented feats. At the same time, I constantly encourage the entire nation to strive for the completion of the goals of the Greater East Asia War and the full realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and diligence. People in Chongqing showed a tendency toward peace in August and September, but a few villains, wielding power, suppressed public opinion and colluded with Britain and the United States to act perversely. Recently, Luo, Qiu, and Chiang met in Cairo, spreading rumors, saying that they must fight until Japan surrenders unconditionally and that Japan must be reduced to a third-rate country. Regardless of the fact that Britain and the United States have suffered repeated defeats in the Greater East Asia War over the past two years, and that the U.S. Navy has recently suffered heavy damage and its embarrassment is fully exposed, their boastful words are merely a laughingstock. The Chongqing side's blind following and adherence means that they have completely abandoned their original goal of resisting Japan and are willing to be directed by Britain and the United States to suppress their East Asian compatriots. This is truly extremely heinous. If they are allowed to act cunningly, it will inevitably lead to half of China falling into an abyss with no bottom. I hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and drive out these rebels who are biting back against East Asia, removing the stain from China and adding brightness to East Asia. I deeply feel that my mission is of great importance in the current situation. I can only work tirelessly day and night to seek progress and look forward to the early arrival of the final victory of Greater East Asia with utmost sincerity.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Bose States in Syonan that He is Determined to Fight for India's Independence and is Confident that Final Victory Will Belong to Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Syonan, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Chairman Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India issued a speech on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, with the main points as follows: All revolutionaries aim for success. The simultaneous outbreak of war in Europe and Asia is what I have hoped for for twenty years. As far as the European war is concerned, its impact on humanity has already been experienced in the previous war. Before the outbreak of this Greater East Asia War, I closely watched Japan's diplomacy, and when the European war broke out, I also paid attention to its impact on East Asia. At the same time, I considered the development of Japanese-Soviet and Japanese-American relations, but after Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka visited the Soviet Union and concluded the Japanese-Soviet Agreement, only Japanese-American relations remained. However, when Ambassador Kurusu went to the United States, I became even more concerned. At that time, authoritative German figures, based on various information, determined that the United States would definitely be defeated in the war, and I was confident that victory would belong to Japan. I also estimated that Britain's war power was very low, because Britain relied solely on the United States, so I firmly believed that Britain and the United States were by no means Japan's opponents. When I had this thought, the Greater East Asia War broke out. Since then, the Japanese army has won consecutive victories and achieved amazing results, which fully proves the correctness of my observations. I formally started the independence movement after the fall of Singapore. My subordinates had repeatedly advised me to promote the independence movement before, but I believed that the independence movement could only be started after the organization was formed, and I was confident that this opportunity would come. When I heard that the Japanese army had captured Singapore, my joy was beyond words. Based on the position of ordinary Indians, I commented on the significance of this war and was convinced that India's independence was an easy task. Asians have broken the so-called first-class countries of Britain and the United States. The current war situation in India has actually reached the stage of attacking India. Now I am determined to continue to fight until I regain our motherland of India.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Manchukuo Premier Zhang's Speech Summary: Strive to Increase Production and Strengthen National Defense <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Shinkyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo Prime Minister Zhang issued a special speech to encourage the people, with the main points as follows: It has been two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In the past year, Britain and the United States, disregarding the enormous sacrifices since the beginning of the war, have made persistent counterattacks in various aspects, but their attempts have been completely shattered as soon as they came into contact with the righteous army of Japan. The invincibility of the Japanese army is truly amazing. In particular, in the several fierce battles in the South Seas, the Japanese army has reaped unprecedented historical results. With the progress of the war, the great work of building Greater East Asia has also been steadily advancing. At the beginning of the year, the Republic of China reluctantly joined the war, and then Burma and the Philippines also gained independence one after another. The Provisional Government of Free India has also established its foundation. Last month, representatives of various countries of Greater East Asia gathered in Tokyo to hold the Greater East Asia Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This declaration announced to the world the determination of all countries and nations of Greater East Asia to cooperate and assist each other, to defeat Britain and the United States, and to build a new order. Therefore, it can be called a great charter that will never be erased. As a result, the unity of Greater East Asia has become more and more solid, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War is even clearer than watching a fire. Under this situation, in order to complete the important responsibility of defending the northern border and increasing combat power, our Manchukuo should devote all its efforts to increase the production of food and materials and strengthen national defense.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government has accepted the request of the Burmese government and decided to dispatch Member of Parliament Ogawa Kyoshiro as the Supreme Advisor to the Burmese government. Mr. Ogawa will go to Burma in the coming days to assume his new post.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The True Meaning of the Greater East Asia War: To Complete the Unity of East Asia. General Hata Issues Statement <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, issued a special statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, stating that it has been two years since the imperial rescript declaring war against Britain and the United States was issued. Aided by imperial authority and the loyalty, bravery, and skillful fighting of Japanese soldiers, we have secured an unshakable posture and a guaranteed-victory war situation in a vast battlefield unprecedented in Japanese history, and we welcome the arrival of the third year of this war. During this period, the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China has constantly taken the initiative, thwarting the attempts of the Chongqing army and the American air force stationed in Chongqing anytime and anywhere. Japan's true intention is to ensure the stability of East Asia through the Greater East Asia War, in order to ensure lasting peace in East Asia. This true intention has become increasingly clear. Moreover, Japan's unwavering national policy towards China is also increasingly presented to the Chinese people through facts. Among them, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty currently concluded has completely overturned the Chongqing side's so-called resistance against Japan. However, the Chongqing side, at this major turning point that determines the destiny of the East Asian nations, still relies on the power of Britain and the United States and has not realized the error of resisting Japan. It is truly sad for the future of the one billion people of East Asia. Moreover, Britain and the United States, who are instigating the Chongqing side to attempt to dominate East Asia, will launch increasingly persistent counterattacks in the future. After suffering repeated defeats, they are urgently seeking to strengthen their air force in China in an attempt to reverse the decline. This strategy must not be taken lightly. However, Japan has established a solid posture in both political and military strategies and will thoroughly destroy all reactionary forces on the path to completing the Greater East Asia War. The true meaning of the Greater East Asia War lies in the normal resolution of Sino-Japanese relations and the fair support and cooperation of the people of both countries, in order to complete the common unity of the East Asian nations. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China directly undertakes this major situation on the Chinese battlefield, so it feels that its responsibility has become increasingly heavy. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the officers and soldiers of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, respectfully upholding the imperial rescript and remembering the sincere and enthusiastic attitude of the people in the rear, and in light of the glorious history and tradition of the expeditionary force, are determined to lead the entire army with an ironclad unity, in order to thoroughly realize the nation's highest policy, and will never rest until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Javanese Residents Should Cooperate in the Holy War <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Jakarta, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Speaker Sukarno of the Central Council of Java convened all members at the Central Assembly Hall at 2:00 PM on the 5th to hold a report meeting on his visit to Japan. He delivered a speech reporting on the process of achieving the purpose of his visit to Japan and explaining the spirit of unity of the Japanese people. He also stated that Japan regards the Greater East Asia War as a holy war, because the destiny of Greater East Asia is tied to Japan's final victory. Therefore, the residents of Java should strive to contribute to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in order to create the destiny of the future.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Comprehensive Power of the East Asian Nations Will Crush the Remaining Forces of Britain and the United States: A Statement from the Japanese Military Authorities in South China <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Force authorities recently issued a statement on the current trends of the Chongqing side. The gist of the statement is as follows: It has been two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Chongqing side is still shouting about resistance against Japan, but in reality, the Chongqing side does not have the ability to resist Japan as it claims. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has implemented a new policy towards China, which has gradually caused the Chongqing side to lose its purpose of resisting Japan. Take the Chongqing side's air force, for example, it is almost invisible, and recently it has been completely under the command of the U.S. Air Force. Other factors, such as the gradual loss of the domestic situation, continue to be factors that cause the Chongqing side to lose the will to resist Japan. Modern warfare is a war of attrition. On the one hand, resources must be developed and production increased. On the other hand, a sufficiently trained workforce is required. The Chongqing side is almost completely unprepared for this. The so-called development of the Northwest is only propaganda and has no results. The Chongqing side lacks coal and iron, so it has no way to maintain its combat power except to seek aid from Britain and the United States. Even today, some of the Chongqing side's important materials have been supplied to Britain and the United States as the price of aid. From the perspective of the Chongqing side's manpower, it seems to be extremely abundant, but the manpower required in modern warfare is different from ordinary times. The Chongqing army lacks training, has no will to fight, and its manpower can be said to be very weak. Under this situation, if the Chongqing side continues to resist Japan, it will only cause the Chongqing people to collapse. In contrast, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Japanese army has gradually expanded the peaceful areas in various parts of China, uniting with the people in various places and striving to build. In South China, Japanese and Chinese military officers and civilians have also united as one, striving to increase food production in the old fertile Pearl River Delta area, and actively strengthening and cultivating existing industries. Recently, land communication with Hong Kong has been completed, and economic construction in South China has seen rapid development. Furthermore, Guangzhou will soon begin transportation with various parts of the South. Now all the nations of Greater East Asia are united as one, working together to complete the Greater East Asia War. We believe that Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, must also be smiling in his grave. China and Japan have been cooperating in military, economic, and cultural aspects to build Greater East Asia. This status quo is difficult for the Chongqing side to deny, but they have ignored it and are willing to be a running dog of Britain and the United States, and continue to resist Japan by making this army a slave army of Britain and the United States. This can be said to be an act of betrayal against Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The Chongqing side will continue to resist Japan in the future, but it will be difficult to prevent the construction of Greater East Asia. We will show the Chongqing side a fact in the near future, that is, we will complete the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the future. The comprehensive power of the East Asian nations will crush Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>Central News Agency – The press department of the Japanese Fleet in China announced at 4:00 PM on the 7th the integrated battle results of the fleet in China over the past year as follows: The Japanese Fleet in China has closely cooperated with the Japanese Army units in China to take on the task of attacking the Chongqing army and the enemy forces in China. At the same time, it has blockaded the Chinese coast and swept away enemy submarines, and has made every effort to protect the safety of maritime transport. Since the enhancement of relations between China and Japan, it has also cooperated in promoting various policies such as the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the handling of enemy property in order to complete its mission. In addition, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, it has cooperated with the Greater East Asia Ministry and various army agencies to develop and transport mainland resources, and has made outstanding contributions to the enhancement of combat power. Later, due to the rebellion of the Battoryo regime and changes in the international situation, as well as the independence of Burma and the Republic of the Philippines, the reform of the Sino-Japanese alliance, and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, cooperation among the countries of Greater East Asia has become closer. Therefore, appropriate countermeasures have been implemented one after another to strengthen the unity of the nations of Greater East Asia. The main operations in the past year include the cooperation of the troops stationed in North China with the army to sweep away enemy bandits in the Shandong Peninsula from mid-November to early December last year and from mid- to late February this year. In late January this year, the troops in South China peacefully advanced into Guangzhou Bay. In addition, the Hainan Island troops have launched sweeping campaigns many times since November last year, and have achieved great results. The Yangtze River troops have severely blockaded the guerrilla operations of the Chongqing side in various coastal areas. From late March to late May this year, they implemented the opening of the Yichang waterway in order to ensure the waterway. On the one hand, they cooperated with the air force to destroy the counterattacks of the Chongqing and American air forces. The integrated battle results over the past year are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Damage inflicted on the Chongqing side: (A) 253 boats sunk, (B) 408 ships captured, (C) 16 aircraft shot down, (D) 489 sea mines disposed of, (E) 5,033 guns and artillery pieces captured, 178,273 rounds of ammunition, 3,604 hand grenades, and 56 landmines and depth charges, (F) 13,643 corpses abandoned, (G) 2,545 prisoners captured, and (H) 8,659 people surrendered and returned to the fold.</p>
<p>2. Japanese losses: (A) 323 killed in action, (B) 613 wounded.</p>

<p>Syonan, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – General Terauchi, Supreme Commander of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, issued the following statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Since the war began, the morale of my Southern Army has been increasing day by day. Remembering the spirit of the people in the motherland working hard for victory with one heart and one mind, I feel infinitely grateful. In terms of military and administrative affairs, thanks to the efforts of related personnel, the bravery of the soldiers in the front lines, and the cooperation of the local people, not only has security been ensured, but also development and construction have been on the right track. At present, the total war posture in the Southern Region has gradually been achieved. However, the purpose of this Greater East Asia War is to crush the exploitation of East Asia by Britain and the United States. In other words, it is to create a new world. Now, Britain and the United States rely on their enormous material war power. Although personnel and materials are consumed greatly, they are still constantly launching persistent counterattacks. The Japanese army is engaged in fierce battles with them everywhere, and the fighting will become more intense in the future. However, the enemy is still obstinate and does not know how to repent. The material strength of Britain and the United States should not be underestimated, and their spiritual strength should not be underestimated either. However, looking back at our country, the manpower and material resources have increased since the beginning of the war, and the determination to complete the war has become more firm. In addition, the Greater East Asia War is a holy war based on morality, so no matter how stubborn Britain and the United States are, they will eventually surrender. This is my war objective. The fact that the belief in the certain victory of subduing Britain and the United States lies in this.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 6th (Central News Agency) – Thai Prime Minister Phibun, to commemorate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, issued the following statement: The expansion of the spheres of influence by Britain and the United States in Greater East Asia in the past was entirely for their own selfish interests. Consequently, the countries of Greater East Asia either lost their independence and sovereignty, or their independence and sovereignty were restricted due to extraterritorial rights and unequal treaties. Japan was the first country in the Greater East Asia region to abolish extraterritorial rights. Subsequently, other countries also followed Japan's example, determined to abolish extraterritorial rights. Now, Japan has completely driven out the violence of Britain and the United States and, in order to restore the independence and sovereignty of the countries of Greater East Asia and build a co-prosperity sphere based on mutual respect for independence, has gone to war with Britain and the United States. Thailand fully understands the true intentions of Japan's war and firmly believes that building a new order in Greater East Asia is the only way to prosper East Asia and a necessary condition for achieving lasting world peace. Therefore, it immediately formed an alliance with Japan, sharing life and death. Since then, it has fully cooperated with Japan in military, political, and economic aspects. The Thai people express their utmost joy and congratulations for the great victories Japan has achieved in the past two years and are confident that after Japan has achieved these glorious victories, the countries of Greater East Asia have laid the foundation for final victory. The outline of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has already been completed. What I hope for is that all countries in Greater East Asia will cooperate with each other and fight with an indomitable spirit, so that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be further glorified.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia War is about to enter its third year, and the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Air warfare and naval warfare are the characteristics of this war. Therefore, the importance of airplanes and ships has also increased accordingly. At the same time, the missions undertaken by the aircraft industry, shipbuilding industry, and shipping industry are becoming increasingly important. Mr. Su Ying Xiaosaburo, Chairman of the Japan New Shipbuilding Control Association, discussed the situation of the shipbuilding industry in Japan as follows: Japan's wartime production has gradually emerged from the preparation period and will begin to increase sharply from the third year of the war. So-called wartime production requires a complete plan. The shipbuilding industry started the earliest. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, it began "building standard ships." The preparation for planned shipbuilding is now ready. The government has also resolutely implemented the policies of ship and maritime national control. Everything has been on track for the past three or four years, and excellent results will be achieved in the coming year. The shipbuilding plan was implemented earlier than other industrial sectors because of the unified regulations and administrative centralization of standard ships. This method will also be implemented in other departments, and the shipbuilding industry has achieved great results as a result. Furthermore, I believe that the production of the entire heavy industry will increase sharply from the coming year. Modern warfare is a total war, and the production war has been prepared since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. After two years of preparation, everything is ready, so it will enter a full-scale stage from the third year. All kinds of materials can have planned production. If this preparation work is completed, production can be increased sharply, and there is no need to be surprised even if the war continues for fifty or a hundred years.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Finnish President's Speech Reiterates Determination to Resist War: Independence and Freedom of Small Countries Should Be Respected <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Helsinki, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to the Huitong News Agency, Finnish President Ryti stated in his speech on the 26th anniversary of Finland's independence: In a few days, the elapsed time of this war will be equal to that of the last war. At that time, most of the major belligerents in Europe were exhausted, and the result was predictable. Although the situation today is different from the previous one, many belligerents have already collapsed or been occupied, but the main belligerents are still as strong as ever, and their strength has increased even more than before. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict the end of this war, and of course, there are many changes in the future of the war, so the international situation in Europe is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Eliminating Small Countries is a Crime Against Humanity</p>
<p>The current development seems to have a significant impact on the status of small countries, and their neutral status has not always been respected. Although the Atlantic Charter and other documents recognize the right of small countries to exist, the general opinion seems to be not to recognize the existence of small countries, which is indeed extremely wrong. Not only should small countries not be eliminated, but large countries should respect their independence. Only independent countries can contribute to the world's culture. The small countries in the Baltic Sea, which gained independence in extremely difficult circumstances, can serve as the basis for future development, and small countries all uphold peace and international organizations, making greater contributions to mankind than any military power. Therefore, reducing small countries is a crime against all mankind, and a peace that unilaterally and arbitrarily aims to eliminate small countries will be difficult to sustain, because countries that have lost their independence will inevitably think of ways to restore it.</p>
<p>Compromising Will Not Avoid Disaster</p>
<p>This war has become a total war, and its outcome will inevitably lead to hatred between countries, and the desire for revenge will inevitably affect the post-war period. Before this war, Finland maintained friendly relations with all countries and strictly abided by international treaties, intending not to be involved in the war. Finland knew that its relationship with the Soviet Union must be based on trust and friendship, so it tried its best to reconcile with it, but the result was still inevitable disaster. It is clearly difficult to believe that Leningrad was threatened by Finland. Even if it wanted to protect Leningrad, there was no need to launch a bloody war to annex Karelia. For four years, Finland has been forced to conduct a defensive war, always with the goal of protecting Finland's life and independence. We concentrate our efforts on defending our territory, but heaven does not seem to bless us.</p>
<p>Clear Distinctions Between Gratitude and Hatred, Will Never Surrender</p>
<p>Since 1940, the total harvest of Finland's flax, potatoes, etc., has decreased by 20% to 30% compared to before the outbreak of the war. The lack of grains is often supplemented by assistance from Germany and Denmark. Finland remembers the assistance of friendly countries. We have experienced various difficulties and dangers. Currently, the enemy is demanding Finland's unconditional surrender. The precedent of unconditional surrender is not enough to entice Finland. I do not believe that Finland's loyal citizens see unconditional surrender to the Soviet Union as possible. After Finland ceded Karelia to the Soviet Union, 470,000 people from Karelia left their homeland, unwilling to be ruled by the Soviet Union. There is no doubt about the people's allegiance. The views of the Finnish people must be the same as those of the Karelian people. Finns are known for their endurance in the sports world and have also demonstrated their endurance in international wars. The Finnish army firmly believes that justice will prevail and does not hesitate to sacrifice for the country. We all recognize the goal of fighting. Our struggle shows the thousands of cities of small countries for freedom and independence.</p>

<p>Argentina Capital, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chicago dispatch: A British merchant ship owner, Machina, publicly stated in Chicago on the 4th, "Currently, German naval soldiers have used torpedoes to sneak into Gibraltar harbor from the seabed to attack ships." The American government and public were greatly surprised by this. According to Machina, ships in Gibraltar harbor had repeatedly sunk for no apparent reason. The British naval authorities in the area actively sought the cause, but ultimately obtained no results. Nets were set up in Gibraltar harbor to prevent submarines from entering, but incidents of ships exploding and sinking continued to occur frequently. One night, a sailor was repairing the bottom of a ship when he suddenly noticed bubbles rising from the seabed. He immediately ordered a diver to go underwater to investigate. The diver returned with a German in one hand and a torpedo in the other. Only then was it known that German naval soldiers were using torpedoes to sneak to the bottom of the ship and attach timed explosive devices, causing ships to sink for no apparent reason from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Center of Eastern Front War Shifts to the Dnieper River Bend: Soviet Winter Warfare Special Forces Still Feel Insufficient <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: In the past 24 hours, the Soviet offensive west of Smolensk has stalled, and the Great Dnieper River bend has become the center of the Eastern Front war. There are three areas of Soviet offensive: the Dnepropetrovsk region, north of Kryvyi Rih, and south of Kremenchug, with the offensive in the third area being the most fierce. A German spokesman said yesterday that the Eastern Front war is the same as when the Soviet army began its offensive on July 5. The Soviets concentrated war equipment and troops to attack at two or three points, initially breaking through the German defense line, but once the German reserves arrived from the rear, they blocked the gap in the line and counterattacked to regain a small amount of land. The former Battle of Smolensk has ended, and the German Fourth Army resisted heroically without the slightest progress from the Soviet army. This offensive in the Great Dnieper River bend was not unexpected by the German side, but it is currently difficult to predict the outcome.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Apart from the major Soviet offensive in the Great Dnieper River bend and the new war in Crimea, the rest of the Eastern Front war is not very important this week. Enemy reports believe that this silence is related to the Soviet troop redeployment. This redeployment should not be underestimated, nor should it be overestimated. It should be remembered that in the past two winters, most of the enemy troops were specially trained troops with special equipment. These winter warfare troops were mainly ski teams, sled teams, and winter warfare tank teams. In addition, there were also special cavalry teams, whose horses were mostly hardy Siberian warhorses. The Soviet side may have formed one or two winter warfare special forces from these units, but their strength should not exceed twelve divisions. Although the Soviet authorities are trying their best to transfer manpower, no matter what, their winter warfare special forces are definitely not enough to take over the entire front line or even most of the front line. Therefore, the Soviet authorities must redeploy miscellaneous troops to make up the so-called winter warfare troops. Now that winter has arrived, both the German and Soviet sides have prepared for winter equipment and transportation, but the German side's preparations started earlier and should be more complete.</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive: Talk by Colonel Kurihara, Head of the Naval Press Section, and Colonel Matsumura, Head of the Army Press Section, of the Japanese General Headquarters <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Differences Between Land Warfare Past and Present, Colonel Kurihara</p>
<p>I hear that Colonel Matsumura is quite knowledgeable about war history. Could you tell me what the distinctive differences are between land warfare in the First European War and this war?</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: In this war, there are very few new weapons with completely different concepts. It is impossible to know whether various weapons will appear in the future, but at present, most of them are weapons that already existed in the previous war and have now made great progress. Take airplanes as an example. In the previous war, the speed was about 200 kilometers per hour, but today it is 600 kilometers to 700 kilometers per hour, and the number is also very large. As for the speed of tanks, it used to be 7 or 8 kilometers per hour, but today it is 50 kilometers to 60 kilometers. As for weight, there are now large tanks weighing 50 or 60 tons. So I think the distinctive feature of this war is that the concept has changed, not to mention that the former East Asia has made extraordinary progress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the previous war, infantry was the main force, and artillery, engineers, and cavalry were secondary. This time, especially in the German-Soviet war, it is a battle of tank units. In addition, airplanes also occupy an important position. In the early days of this war, the term "blitzkrieg" was very popular, which is nothing more than saying that it means speed. In the past, infantry advanced at a pace of 75 centimeters, but today, tanks, which generally travel at tens of kilometers per hour, are the main force of the war, supported by wireless radio and superior aircraft.</p>
<p>In the early days of this European war, Germany's attacks on France and Poland were all successful, thanks to speed. The lack of adequate defense methods against these agile weapons, I think, was the biggest reason for the failure of France and Poland. As for today's German-Soviet war, because it is a tank-versus-tank battle, the main body of the field battle can be said to be the encounter battle between tanks and tanks.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the methods of war, for example, in the past, there was the Battle of Annihilation, such as the Battle of Tannenberg and the Battle of Masuria, etc., but the scale is insignificant compared to today's. In the past, each infantry unit often gradually encircled the enemy's flanks or forced the enemy into swampy areas and annihilated them. However, at present, tanks are used to break through the enemy's front line, break through into a "wedge" shape, and then expand the two sides of the wedge to encircle the enemy. After the Polish war, I asked a German military attaché, "Where is the Tannenberg of the past?" He replied, "The entire Polish war is Tannenberg." In short, the encircled troops are often very numerous, which must also be a major feature of this war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking of the methods of war, it was mostly trench warfare in the past, but since the Maginot Line was destroyed, there has not been much trench warfare. Of course, defensive methods such as anti-tank obstacles and anti-tank trenches have also improved, but the defenders ultimately feel inferior to the attacking equipment such as large tanks and paratrooper units. In many cases, the German-Soviet war is called the model of land warfare. The mechanical units, with tanks as the main force, encounter battles, and the scene of the large air force scattering like sparks above them, is indeed a spectacle of land warfare. So, what about naval warfare?</p>
<p>Naval Night Battles Are Different Now Than in the Past, Colonel Kurihara</p>
<p>So-called naval warfare is often a struggle for so-called sea control. The main actor in the struggle for sea control is the battleship. Therefore, until now, when talking about naval power, battleships have always been the standard. It is claimed that they have tens of thousands of tons of battleships, hundreds of thousands of tons. But in today's war, airplanes also exert extraordinary power, which must be the case in land battles as well. In naval battles, airplanes are also at the core. In this case, shouldn't the word "sea control" be revised? I think it should be changed to "naval battle under air control."</p>
<p>Those who seize air control often have 90% certainty of victory. I think this is very different from the previous war.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a very significant change in naval warfare, which is that a new weapon called a radio wave detector has now appeared. This is a very revolutionary change, especially for the Japanese navy, which is accustomed to night battles, and has high expectations for it. Due to the emergence of radio wave detectors, the methods of night battles have also changed greatly. I think this is also a point of difference from the previous war.</p>
<p>Only submarines are still no different from the First European War. Currently, submarines are still very difficult to deal with. For countries like Japan, whether from an operational or a production war perspective, they are very dependent on ships, so submarines are especially annoying.</p>
<p>The war has now lasted for two years and is gradually entering the decisive stage, so I think we should make the people clearly aware of the current situation at this time, and everyone should exert their final strength. Therefore, what has been the situation up to now? What is the current situation? The people must be made to understand. Regarding the situation up to now, how can we make it easy for the people to understand?</p>
<p>War for Self-Preservation and Self-Defense, Colonel Matsumura</p>
<p>When Japan rose up for self-preservation and self-defense two years ago, the United States and Britain thought that Japan was easy to deal with. Of course, Japan is an island nation in the East Sea, lacking both oil and rubber, and simply has no resources to speak of. War materials are indeed lacking, but once it rose up in a corner of East Asia, there was immediately the great victory at Pearl Harbor, the landing in Malaya, and the occupation of Malaya, Java, and Burma, driving the United States and Britain out of Greater East Asia and attacking New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Southwest Pacific. As a result, Japan obtained oil, rubber, and tin from the south, and obtained various resources. In less than half a year after the start of the war, we established a self-sufficiency plan for war materials.</p>
<p>Moreover, the defense circle was pushed out 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers from the Japanese mainland. India and Australia were within reach, completing a sure-to-win and invincible situation. This is the first stage of the war.</p>
<p>The second stage of the war is the American counteroffensive. Since being defeated by Japan at the beginning of the war, they have done their best to greatly expand their airplanes and ships. According to Marshall, millions of people have been mobilized, and 80% of the students have become pilots, desperately strengthening their strength. Since last summer, they have been shouting for a counteroffensive, from the southern Solomon Islands to the central Solomon Islands. Since the beginning of last month, they have counterattacked Bougainville in the northern Solomon Islands, and a few days ago, they counterattacked the Gilbert Islands. Recently, the navy has established great achievements in Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands. The people's depressed mood has suddenly been relieved, and we are extremely grateful. The third stage is to intercept the enemy's counteroffensive, push it back, and further severely crush the enemy. Colonel Kurihara, now please talk about the people's feelings.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara</p>
<p>We hope that the people will think about this kind of thing. In short, as you just said, the first stage was that Japan acquired the areas necessary for self-preservation. Therefore, the people have a feeling that since the war for self-preservation has been successful, the war can be won just by doing it casually. In reality, even if it is not so easily optimistic, don't you think that the war has basically completed 80% or 90% of it? This is worrying. Such thinking is unacceptable. We should remember that this is just establishing a self-sufficient economic plan that can ensure self-preservation. Fortunately, this self-sufficient economic zone has been completed, so the war can continue. From this, we can engage in the second stage of the war. This self-sufficient economic zone is the minimum limit for Japan. It is the good situation you just said of establishing an invincible situation.</p>
<p>However, the United States and Britain know that if this continues, Japan's strength will increase with time, so they want to push it back no matter what, and therefore there is the recent counteroffensive. Japan's war aim is entirely for self-preservation and self-defense, so the first stage is self-preservation, and the war from now on is a war for self-defense. Because they want to counterattack, we must implement the so-called war of self-defense everywhere and intercept them. This is what we hope to appeal to the people.</p>
<p>The Mentality the People Should Have, Colonel Matsumura</p>
<p>After the end of the first stage, the war is proceeding step by step. Although there are many amazing war results, the United States and Britain are world powers, and of course they cannot be easily resolved in a short time. As for today's counteroffensive, Japan of course expected it long ago and it is not surprising.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara</p>
<p>I also think so. The previous wars and this war are completely different. In the past wars, the army and navy seemed to be players, and the people were the spectators who lined up the players. When they saw that the players they were supporting won, they were wildly happy, and if they were defeated, they would be dejected. However, the essence of modern warfare is definitely not like this. I hope the people will think about this point.</p>
<p>Because there have been no major victories for a long time, the people's morale is being questioned. Fortunately, recently there have been great victories in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Gilbert Islands. However, at this time, we should be absolutely careful not to have that kind of frivolous and optimistic atmosphere when we see the "sumo" wrestler we are supporting taking the upper hand.

<h3 id="e26">Reporting Department Chief of the Japanese Fleet Issues Important Statement, Declaring Determination to Fight to the End <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: It has been three years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. During this period, thanks to the valiant efforts of the Allied land, sea, and air forces, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, the foundation for inevitable victory has been laid. The Reporting Department Chief of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China issued a statement on the 7th, declaring the determination to fight to the end, and predicting that the war situation would become even more intense. He expressed hope that the people in the rear would each fulfill their assigned combat responsibilities consistently from beginning to end. The content of his statement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Soldiers Must Kill Every Enemy They See</p>
<p>The second anniversary of the Holy War has arrived. Looking back at the progress of the war in the Pacific since the enemy's counteroffensive began last autumn, and the changes in the world situation, and considering the current war situation, we are filled with profound emotions. The enemy attempted to break through our lines from the Solomon Islands and sever the connection between the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere and our homeland, thus initiating fierce fighting in the Solomon Islands. Since late October, battles have been fought six times in the Bougainville Island area. Thanks to the fierce fighting of our soldiers who are determined to kill every enemy they see, a total of 94 enemy ships have been sunk or destroyed, and 592 enemy aircraft have been shot down, causing the US Navy authorities to admit the severity of their losses. To reverse their decline, the enemy plotted an offensive in the Gilbert Islands. As of now, they have sunk or destroyed 26 of their ships and shot down 145 aircraft. Out of desperation, the enemy is already showing signs of self-destruction, concentrating a large number of ships and aircraft, and sacrificing great lives, in an attempt to launch a final desperate attack in that area. Therefore, it is predicted that the battles in that area will become increasingly fierce after the second round.</p>
<p>Inevitable Victory Increasingly Consolidated</p>
<p>In addition to this major offensive, the enemy, in an attempt to respond and divert attention, has also launched so-called Burmese counteroffensives and air raids on mainland China, as well as movements in the northern areas and submarine attacks on commercial shipping. On the one hand, they are also using their self-proclaimed successful propaganda and ideological warfare, conducting anti-Axis talks, and using heavy bombs, and fabricating various favorable war situations, in an attempt to boost their power and influence. Judging from the enemy's leaders' sudden and frequent trips to various places, we can see the urgency of their situation. And judging from the enemy's counteroffensives' disregard for strategic tactics, we can see the depth of their anxiety. Conversely, regardless of the local war situation, our side's momentum of inevitable victory is only becoming stronger day by day. The closer the enemy gets to our strategic center, the greater their losses will be. We will never stop until we achieve final victory. The epoch-making increase in productivity, the strengthening of transportation capacity, the rapid expansion of combat power on both the personnel and material fronts, and the achievements of promoting independent ideological warfare offensives are all combat responsibilities that our people in the rear should bear. All of our lives and actions, no matter where we are, contain fierce battles. This battle is the most intense battle in the history of the world, a struggle for the justice of humanity, a battle of material strength and spiritual strength, a battle of individualism and dedication to the country. The blood of our ancestors has already merged with our blood, and the spirits of the war dead protect our future. We must resolutely annihilate the enemy and never give up.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Speech by Japanese Naval Attaché <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, thanks to the majestic power of the Emperor and the glorious military might of the Imperial Army, which has covered the Greater East Asia and repeatedly crushed the fierce counteroffensives of Britain and the United States, the decisive unity of the Greater East Asian nations is also becoming increasingly solid, and the great steps of grand construction are steadily advancing. This is truly cause for celebration.</p>
<p>The fleet in China, with close cooperation from the elite units of the army, has also established combat locations and is working on two fronts, bearing the great responsibility of the Greater East Asia War. All officers and soldiers are working day and night, striving to fulfill their mission. After the establishment of the alliance treaty, Japanese-Chinese cooperation is expected to increase, moving towards the complete realization of shared life and death. We are confident that in the future, we will overcome any difficulties and achieve the core of this holy war for national liberation, the labor and mission of [木?].</p>
<p>However, even though the enemy has suffered several miserable defeats, it is easy to deduce that they will still fight fiercely in resistance. It is also expected that they will use [檀?] and other means to confuse the current difficult situation and unleash their ideological sharpness. As we realize that the third year of the war is the year of true decisive battle, our determination to work diligently in our respective positions is self-evident and needs no further elaboration.</p>
<p>Today, at this moment, is the time for us to display the great achievements of our ancestors, repay the country with our lives, and support the flourishing imperial destiny. All our lives, all our actions, should be guided by this sincerity.</p>
<p>We also hope that the local officials and people will be more diligent and strive together to fulfill this holy war.</p>

<p>Recently, due to transportation difficulties, the arrival and sales of various coal retail quantities have been difficult to balance, resulting in illegal price increases in sales.

The chairman's seat was in the center, with seats for officials on the left and right, and seats for representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, the Philippines, and India on both sides. General congratulatory seats were located on the side, and the press seats were located behind the seats. The arrangement was quite solemn.

The Shanghai China Film United Film Company sent personnel to the venue to take newsreel footage of the grand meeting.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>The meeting was originally scheduled to be chaired by Mr. Hirota, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, but Mr. Hirota was unable to attend due to official business. Mr. Funatsu Tatsujiro of the Koa Hokokai presided over the meeting. The attendees included Minister Izubuchi of the Reporting Department of the Army, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department, Captain Tsugita, Secretary Manabe of the Embassy in Shanghai, and representatives of the five East Asian nations, including Liu Yangshan, [彬?] Su, Zhou Huarren, Yuan Fudeng, Cheng Zhiliang, Xu Liqiu, Xu Chao Yuan, Lang Yufei, Gu Benfan, Cao Jianjin, Zhu Ding, Li Bingqing, Jiang Wanchun [水?] Qian Jianwu, and others from China; Takeuti Fumin, Ashisaka Yoichi, Toda Yasuso, Kurimizu Toraji, [服?] Bumon Heito, and others from Japan; Consul General Yo Ko of Manchuria, Matsuba Hideo, Yu Qi, and others; Wei [?] Casino, Contrelas, Arobauqi, A.

Yun Peng, the Secretary-General of the News Federation, served as the Chinese-Japanese interpreter for the meeting.</p>
<p>The Grand Occasion of the Meeting</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia Ethnic Representatives Informal Discussion Meeting opened punctually and solemnly. Everyone took their seats in order. The two reporting chiefs of the Army and Navy were seated on the left side of the chairman's seat. Everyone saluted the national flags of the Greater East Asia countries and then sang the national anthems of the five countries. After silently praying for the war dead of the Greater East Asia, Chairman Funatsu delivered the opening remarks. Next, Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department and Minister Izubuchi of the Army Reporting Department reported on the war situation. Then, representatives from the Greater East Asian countries spoke in succession. First, Secretary-General Liu Yangshan of the Shanghai Branch of the Eastern Federation, representing the Republic of China, gave a speech on the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of the East Asian nations. Next, Mr. [彬?] Dun, President of this newspaper, also representing China, gave a speech on the topic of the third year of the Greater East Asia War. Following them, Consul General Yo Ko of Manchuria, Chairman Wei Xian of the Philippine Association, Representative Khuda [?] of the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League, and Takeuti Fumin, a cooperating member of the Japan Koa Hokokai, and Osaka Yoichi, a director of the Mainland News, and others spoke in succession.

Lastly, Chairman Funatsu led the gathering in chanting "Long live the East Asian nations" three times. Thus, this warm and grand Greater East Asia Ethnic Representatives Informal Discussion Meeting came to a successful conclusion. Everyone took a group photo after the meeting, which concluded at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Funatsu Tatsujiro gave the opening remarks, which stated, in brief: "You all know very well the final ultimatum that the enemy America issued to Japan on November 26th two years ago. At that time, Japan was in an unbearable situation. If Japan had accepted it at the beginning, the situation today would have been supported by the United States. Therefore, the countries of East Asia would have been in an unbearable situation. Therefore, Japan was forced to launch the war on December 8th of that year. When the Greater East Asia War opened, fortunately, the Japanese Air Force was invincible, and wherever it went, it won great victories. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, it broke the entire power of Britain and the United States [?]. In today's East Asia, the power of Britain and the United States no longer exists. I believe you all know this from the newspapers. To regain their past losses, Britain and the United States have been racking their brains to plan a counteroffensive. Both the North and South Pacific are the goals of their plans. I personally hope that you will consider what the situation will be like if the enemy Britain and the United States succeed in their attempted counteroffensive and their evil forces re-enter the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I hope you will use all your strength to launch a general offensive and defeat Britain and the United States so that they cannot invade. The ambition of Britain and the United States to plunder East Asia is always plotting to revive from the ashes. Therefore, we must have a firm belief and work hard. This war may not be short-term and may last five or ten years. The Japanese side, from top to bottom, has already resolved to defeat Britain and the United States and achieve final victory. Therefore, we are confident of winning. I hope that all one billion people in the entire East Asia will have a consistent determination. This war must achieve victory so that the East Asian nations can coexist and prosper. I also hope that those who have money will contribute money, and those who have strength will contribute strength. With one heart and one mind, we pray for the victory of the Greater East Asia [?] war."</p>
<p>Matsushima's Report</p>
<p>Fleet Reporting Department Chief Matsushima, a colonel, reported on the war situation, saying that on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army had achieved significant victories and crushed the enemy's fierce counteroffensives, completely thwarting the enemy's attempts. The center of the decisive battle is in the South Pacific. Since late October, six major naval battles have taken place before and after Bougainville Island, destroying 90 enemy warships and shooting down 500 enemy aircraft, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. Moreover, the enemy has launched several counteroffensives in the final Gilbert Islands and [金?] Island, and has again destroyed 30 of their ships and more than 100 aircraft. Therefore, in the enemy's fleet, its battleships, aircraft carriers, important ships, and 60,000 to 70,000 excellent soldiers have been lost in this counteroffensive, showing the enormous scale of its counteroffensive power, and the impact it has had is quite large. Afterwards, we moved the front line to the inner line for operations and destroyed them individually, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. As for the northern sea, the enemy army is preparing for an air counteroffensive, and is constantly planning and waiting for an opportunity. We have been strictly on guard. Fortunately, due to weather conditions, the enemy has not launched any counteroffensives. Whether in the southern or northern seas, the enemy's air force has only made some minor movements and has not achieved much. In Burma, no counteroffensive has been launched. Our land, sea, and air force vanguards attacked first, causing the enemy to [?]. In summary, we have established inevitable victory in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the enemy has no room to recover and is constantly being attacked by us. Therefore, the completion of the Greater East Asia War is expected to come soon. I hope that you will all unite as one, strengthen the determination of the people, work together, and complete the victory of the Greater East Asia. Therefore, the time for the liberation of the Asian nations has been established.</p>
<p>Izubuchi's Report</p>
<p>Army Reporting Department Chief Izubuchi reported on the war situation, saying that at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States had been badly defeated. Seeing that a long-term war was just a drain, they changed their strategy and attempted a counteroffensive by staking their vast strength on a single throw. Therefore, this general counteroffensive against Japan was not only in the [甫?] sea, but also used Burma and the mainland of [渝?] to drive the [渝?] army to counterattack Japan, and to instigate the American air force in [渝?] to attack Japan's airspace. However, [渝?] voluntarily went against the trend, willingly became a traitor to the Greater East Asia, dreaming that Britain and the United States would win victory, and willingly allowed Britain and the United States to use the area as a false front. At the current stage of the war on the [渝?] mainland, their internal divisions are complex and divergent, while the actions of the Japanese army imply a clear resolve and confidence to arrive at a very rapid decisive battle. Since November 2nd, the Japanese army has been in the Xiangxi area of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After a month, it completely wiped out 100,000 of the [渝?] Central Army in each area, making it impossible to turn the situation around. On December 3rd, it completely occupied Changde in the 6th War Zone of [渝?]. Changde has always been valued by [渝?], and is the same center point as Changsha, and has always been a base for cultivating resistance. Therefore, in this operation, the [渝?] side suffered more than 10,000 casualties, while our soldiers suffered only 550 casualties. The large number of [渝?] casualties is enough to show the intensity of the resistance at that time. The movement of the American air force in [渝?] was preempted and the dream of their attempt to raid Japan was shattered. Moreover, it is also planning to seize control of [渝?]. Recently, a joint American-[渝?] air force was established. The American-[渝?] air force participated in the war on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and 14 aircraft were shot down. Therefore, the American-[渝?] air force has no effect in the war on the mainland. Looking back at the war results of the Japanese dispatched army in China in the past, the main battles totaled 39 times, engagements more than 22,000 times, troop deployment 3.3 million, and the enemy's war dead reached 210,000, and more than 170,000 were captured. To further describe the losses of the American air force in [渝?], 251 aircraft were shot down, and all but 8 of them belonged to the American air force in [渝?]. This is enough to show that the strength of the American air force in [渝?] is weak. In addition, on the Burmese front, [渝?] was impatient and planned to open up the road to [漢甸?] for supplies, and the United States also used the route to try to secure it, and to strengthen the strength of the American air force in [渝?] to plan a new route to attack Japan. The British side also planned to regain Burma and maintain India, not only using Burma's economy, etc., but also to oppress India. Although their goals are different, their movements are the same. On the other hand, in the Yunnan territory, the [渝?] army attempted to attack. Last month, the Japanese army attacked and surrounded and eliminated the [渝?] army on the west bank of the Nujiang River, while the British and Indian troops did not provide assistance. Therefore, after the Japanese army, which is rich in activity in the Yunnan-Burma [經?], began to attack, Britain, the United States, and [渝?] became even more anxious. The Japanese army in South China has long been prepared to attack the [渝?] inland. The battle on the [渝?] front will soon be clear. In summary, the general situation is centered on the [渝?] front. Incidentally, the northern defense is firmly strengthened. I hope that you will be determined and work hard consistently to ensure that the day of bright [明?] East Asia will come soon. With this determination, let us strive forward.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Representatives of the Five Greater East Asian Nations in Shanghai Issue a Joint Declaration <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: After the Shanghai Greater East Asia Ethnic Representatives Informal Discussion Meeting, representatives of the five Greater East Asian nations in Shanghai—China, Japan, Manchuria, the Philippines, and India—issued a joint declaration. The original text is as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, two years have passed in an instant. The British and American forces, which harbor the ambition to invade and enslave Greater East Asia, are on the verge of collapse, and the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asian nations has long been established. The foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has also been laid, and the great undertaking of Greater East Asia construction is progressing. For example, China and Japan have concluded a new alliance, Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, and the Provisional Government of Free India has also been established. Furthermore, in early November of this year, the Greater East Asian nations held a Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration. From then on, each East Asian nation will get what it deserves, help each other, and share the joy of co-prosperity. Is this the fundamental meaning of establishing world peace? It has already been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is also here. Today, one billion people in Asia are restoring their original character, based on Eastern morality, and gathering together for the construction of Greater East Asia. This is all thanks to the Japanese Army and Navy, as well as the national armies of the Greater East Asian nations, who have fought hard beyond life and death. Today, fierce battles are unfolding in the Nanyang area, which is a fact known to the world. How should we East Asian nations be grateful? We respectfully pay our sincere respect to the soldiers on the front lines. At the same time, we express our deep condolences to the heroic spirits who are the cornerstone of protecting the country and the pillars of building the nation. We, the representatives of the Greater East Asian nations residing in Shanghai, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, should know that without the completion of the Greater East Asia War, it will be difficult to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity, as well as cultural revival. Therefore, we must realize that this is our duty entrusted by Heaven. Based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we will overcome all difficulties, realize the cooperative and united posture of the Greater East Asian nations, and implement the necessary means to completely defeat Britain and the United States and complete the Greater East Asia War. We swear to stand up and assist in the great undertaking of building a new order in Greater East Asia. The declaration is as above. December 7, 1943.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Mr. Chen Bin's Speech on the Third Year's Task of the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Speech by Mr. Chen Bin, our country's representative and president of this newspaper, original words:</p>
<p>Two years ago, in Shanghai, it was impossible for the various ethnic groups of East Asia to gather together and discuss the major issues of East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has first brilliantly achieved an auspicious initial battle, followed by glorious victories. Until recently, the Greater East Asia Conference issued an unprecedented great charter seeking co-existence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promoting culture, and prospering the economy in Greater East Asia, and further dedicating this belief to the world. Today, we are able to sit here and freely express our opinions, jointly discussing the problems of East Asia itself. This is the most glorious page in the history of East Asia, even in world history.</p>
<p>Thanks to the leadership of our ally Japan, the Asian ideal of "Asia for Asians" has largely been realized today. Therefore, the outer form of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has, in fact, reached the highest ideal. Future tasks are concentrated within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, on how to consolidate it, and on how to consolidate internal harmony. This is not something that Japan alone can bear; each ethnic group has its own responsibility.</p>
<p>First, in the future, each ethnic group within the Co-Prosperity Sphere should stand on an equal footing of obligation, and contribute their respective strengths to the consolidation of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, so as to have genuine cooperation.</p>
<p>Second, each ethnic group should openly reveal its own weaknesses without reservation, and be brave enough to innovate. Because strengthening one's own strength is strengthening the strength of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and weakening one's own strength is weakening the strength of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Now entering the third year of the Greater East Asia War, there are four tasks that our Chinese nation should strive for:</p>
<p>First, the Greater East Asia War was originally a war of "I will destroy the enemy, or the enemy will destroy me." The rise and fall of East Asia depends on this one battle, and the rise and fall of China also depends on this one battle. This is a basic understanding.</p>
<p>Second, jointly striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War is our responsibility. Our emotions towards the war are not too late even now. It is the right time to contribute everything to cooperate with the war. The war is not limited to battles on the front lines. Politics, economy, technology, science, and ideology are all in the ranks of battle. We should cooperate with the war with absolute belief, and then we can be certain of victory.</p>
<p>Third, the demands of the front lines for the rear are the most practical things for people and materials, not just verbal or written cooperation.</p>
<p>Fourth, within the entire territory of China, today there is still the split of the Chongqing regime and the subversive sabotage of the Communist Party. How should we reform politics, stabilize people's livelihoods, so that the people of the whole country can move towards unity and cooperate with the Greater East Asia War? This important responsibility rests entirely on the shoulders of the Nanjing National Government and the people in the peace zone.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Mr. Liu Yangshan's Speech on the Greater East Asia War and the Liberation of East Asian Nations <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Speech by Mr. Liu Yangshan, representative of the East Asia League China General Branch Shanghai Branch and Secretary-General, on the topic of "The Greater East Asia War and the Liberation of East Asian Nations," original draft as follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to participate in this symposium today and have the opportunity to say a few words. This symposium, in terms of the countries to which the participants belong, is international. In terms of the common mission and harmonious spirit, it can also be said to be a symposium of brothers in a big family. We are holding this symposium on the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and its significance is evident.</p>
<p>My topic today is "The Greater East Asia War and the Liberation of East Asian Nations." When the Greater East Asia War began, those with incorrect understanding generally thought that this was only Japan's resistance to Anglo-American aggression. Now everyone understands that this is a war for the liberation of East Asian nations. To liberate East Asia, we must defeat the Anglo-American imperialists who have invaded East Asia. Only after the Anglo-American efforts collapse can the world be stable and the cause of the liberation of East Asian nations be successfully completed. This war is truly a war of life and death for the Greater East Asian nations."</p>
<p>Before the Greater East Asia War broke out, the so-called "Far East Problem" in recent decades was nothing more than how the Anglo-American imperialists divided up and ruled the East Asian colonies. East Asia, because of its abundant resources and suitable climate, is blessed by nature. Precisely because of this, East Asia has become the target of European and American colonial expansion. For nearly a hundred years, it has truly suffered from the invasion and trampling of imperialists. Especially since the First World War in 1914, the Anglo-American imperialists have become even more blatant. All the losses of participating in the European war were sought from the weak East Asian nations to seek compensation."</p>
<p>At that time, the Anglo-American imperialists had many conflicts in order to compete for East Asian colonies, but in maintaining the common superior status of white people and eliminating the resistance movement of East Asian nations, the attitude taken was consistent. All the fronts united by Anglo-American utilitarianism were aimed at inducing conflicts between China and Japan, completing their purpose of "divide and conquer" and "separate rule." Such painful facts are too numerous to mention. Finally, they joined the so-called ABCD line of defense, adding greater encirclement and threats to East Asia. Their vicious intentions simply sought to place the East Asian nations in a situation of no return."</p>
<p>However, the East Asian nations are the most civilized and most outstanding nations in the world, and have never been trampled on and conquered forever, and finally jointly issued the call for East Asian liberation and the action of liberation. For example, Japan's Meiji Restoration was the first to initiate the effort of East Asian nations to get rid of the shackles of imperialism. Our founding father advocated Pan-Asianism, which is the most correct policy for East Asian nations to seek liberation together and build together."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, apart from our ally Japan which, since the Meiji Restoration, has strived for strength and only managed to get rid of the clutches of imperialism, unfortunately, most of our East Asian compatriots did not recognize the true meaning of Pan-Asianism, but were incited by the Anglo-American invaders, and even engaged in internal strife, causing the liberation of East Asian nations to encounter great obstacles.</p>
<p>Fortunately, enlightened people in China and Japan saw through the conspiracies of the Anglo-American imperialists, stood up, and advocated the peace movement. In the 27th year [of the Republic], after the declaration by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, our leader Chairman Wang [Jingwei] issued a telegram, reorganizing the relations between the two countries, externally seeking close cooperation with neighbors, and internally stabilizing people's livelihoods to restore national strength. Until January 9 this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. This spirit of truly sharing responsibilities, sharing joys and sorrows, and sharing life and death, undoubtedly recognizes that China is a powerful partner in the Greater East Asia War.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e38">Re-discussing Prices <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>We haven't discussed the issue of prices for a long time. The reason is that since the government announced the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in early August this year, the relevant authorities have successively adopted bold measures to severely punish speculators and profiteers. After the unscrupulous merchants in various industries disappeared, they were even more worried that their hoarded goods would be purchased, and they rushed to release them. As a result, various prices generally fell, and until the end of last month, they turned horizontally downwards. However, since the beginning of this month, the tight monetary situation caused by the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth has eased, and recently, speculators have again used the reason of reduced electricity production to carry out their activities. As a result, in the past two weeks, the prices of all goods have become unrecognizable again. Among them, the price increases of fuels, such as cigarettes, white coal, coal balls, firewood, charcoal, and all cotton textiles made from yarn, are the most alarming. In addition, non-major items, such as cigarettes, candles, leather shoes, and other items that do not directly affect people's livelihoods, have also risen linearly, with the potential to indirectly stimulate other prices.</p>
<p>The most important and most obvious reason for rising prices is, of course, the devaluation of currency and the demand for goods exceeding supply. The focus of suppressing prices is to increase production and facilitate transportation and sales. However, restricting the disruption of prices from the monetary and financial aspects, in other words, restricting improper lending and suppressing the floating purchasing power in society, is ultimately a price policy of drawing firewood from under the pot. Because hoarding for profit and indulging in extravagance in society are mostly due to floating purchasing power.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Economic Bureau Urges Reporting Quantities of Main Items to Provide Data for Price Evaluation <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau, in order to balance the prices of all goods and promote the healthy development of industry and commerce, has issued a notice to various industries to report the quantities of main items within a specified period, so as to compile statistics and provide data for price evaluation and household distribution. However, after the member firms of various industry associations receive this form, they must fill in detailed business information and send it to the bureau for disposal. There are many people who conscientiously fill in and send the forms, but there are also many who intend to wait and see, which violates the law and will inevitably be subject to legal sanctions or suspected of illegal hoarding.</p>
<p>Letter Urges Submission of Forms by Deadline</p>
<p>In order to complete the statistics of material inventory as soon as possible, the bureau has sent letters to various industry associations, instructing them to receive and submit the forms by deadline. The original letter stated: "In order to count the quantity of main items in this city, this bureau has formulated survey forms and registration forms of business conditions, which have been notified by this bureau's Economic Section 4, No. 167, to send personnel to the bureau to receive them and instruct the members of each industry to fill in and report them separately. It has been a long time, and we have not yet received the public association to receive them. This matter concerns important statistical policies, so we hereby send another letter to urge you to check and receive them by deadline, and do not wait and see any longer.</p>
<p>No Shortage of Supply of All Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter also inquired from various industry associations about the inventory of various main and non-essential items. So far, they are still sufficient, and there is no shortage of future supply. Among them, such as woolen cloth, silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, paper, dyes, etc., the total can meet the city's needs for several years, and at least can meet the city's needs for more than one or two years. However, most of this inventory is held by merchants who operate these items, and a small number is purchased and accumulated by people who do not formally operate these items or are outside the industry. At the same time, the date of purchase is far more than two years ago, so the cost is very low.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special City Qian-Dui Industry Association, in order to maintain the current business of the industry, convened a meeting yesterday. More than 90 Qian-Dui companies under its jurisdiction decided to first file with the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, and then apply to the Economic Bureau of this city for registration and obtain a business license. At the same time, the association is also carefully planning for the future business of the industry, establishing the principle of not engaging in speculative business. If any industry member is found to be engaged in speculative business, their membership will be immediately revoked and business will be prohibited.</p>

<p>With the dissolution of the Central China Silk Company, the future trend of the silk industry is highly noteworthy. According to Japanese newspapers, the China Silk Company and five other companies, as well as personnel from the silk industry association, are jointly starting to purchase silkworm cocoons in the area centered on Wuxi. The purchase funds are loans of several million yuan from a consortium of 19 banks, including the China Transportation, Huaxing Commercial, and other banks.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Chinese Stocks Remain Strong, Datong and World Stocks See New Highs <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks fluctuated indefinitely, rising and falling in a sideways movement. Most closed at the highest price of the day, which strengthened the hearts of the weak. In the "Textile Industry," Datong Yarn Factory had the largest increase. Xinhuo once fell, but finally returned to the same level as Zhongfang. The Yong'an Yarn Factory fluctuated narrowly throughout the day. "Culture and Entertainment" stocks rose almost uniformly, especially the World Bookstore and China Film, which both reached unprecedented peaks in the afternoon. "Department Stores" were relatively stable. In "Chemical Industry," the price of Senmao Chemical saw a slight increase, while Zhongfa and Xinya were very flat. In "Public Utilities," 315 yuan was transacted for Zhabei Water and Electricity and 210 yuan for Huashang Electric. In "Finance and Investment," Xinya Construction once rose close to 30 yuan, and Sanle Industrial rose by more than one yuan. The remaining increases and decreases were slight. The "Real Estate Industry" trend was very stable, and Xinheng, Yongxing, etc. all saw increases. In "Other Industries," Kangyuan Biscuit immediately fell after the 100-yuan level was entered. Trading was extremely active throughout the day. The closing prices of major stocks are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Business Summary <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday's prices were still mixed, with extremely little trading. Type C initial issues were still relatively stable, but "Bu Yao" once saw a decline. The final price at noon recovered slightly, resulting in a small increase of 4 yuan compared to the previous day. Type A was down 2, Type B was down 1, Type D had no trading, and Type E was down 4.</p>
<p>Interbank Rate: The interbank rate of the Qianpiao Association was listed at 18%, which remained unchanged. Rice: Yesterday, thousands of bags were delivered by truck and Bun-shaped packages. Retail sales were slow, and scattered households were busy. The market showed an upward trend.</p>
<p>Cereals: Nanjing yellow soybeans, wheat, and Mingguang mung beans were still mostly up, with supply falling short of demand. Cigarettes: Again showed a state of having prices but no sales. Old British Knife, Qianmen, Quanlu, etc. were all stable, the same as the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Yesterday, the price of candles was still calling high, and matches, US products, and Phoenix were still strong. Soap was stable.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth: Heavy overcoat woolen cloth can be described as widely sold at the right time. Because winter has arrived and the weather continues to be cold, actual sales are stimulated, and buyers' demand is strong. The Nanjing gang sends many goods to Shanghai every day, but mostly ordinary and low-grade goods below 1,000 yuan. The tailors and tailors of Western clothing in this street, etc., are all improving their procurement because of good actual sales. Standard prices are rising due to excessive demand</p>

<h3 id="e45">National Representatives Conference (Continued from Page 3) <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>After Japan, an allied nation, was sued in China for participating in the war, it returned concessions, signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, assisted Burma and the Philippines in achieving independence, established a provisional government in India, and recently held the Greater East Asia Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration. This proves the allied nations' proactive nature in completing the Greater East Asia War to liberate the East Asian peoples.</p>
<p>Looking at the evolution of the situation, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was a natural development. The liberation of the East Asian peoples accompanying the Greater East Asia War is a natural result, and only by shouting for national liberation can we awaken and unite the various East Asian peoples.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must recognize reality. East Asia cannot be conquered. The sovereignty and territory of East Asian countries are independent and free. However, the power contributed to the Greater East Asia War must be integrated and indivisible. The Greater East Asia War is fought for the survival of the entire East Asian nation. If the Greater East Asia War is won, all East Asian nations can gain freedom and liberation; otherwise, they will perish together. Speaking of a single country, each East Asian country has its natural characteristics. As far as the Greater East Asia War is concerned, all East Asian nations should work together to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. The only path for our East Asian nations to seek survival is to move forward on this path; there is no other way to go.</p>
<p>The British and American imperialists are still trying to use the land of China under the control of Chongqing's Chiang Kai-shek as a battlefield for fighting for Britain and America, driving Chinese people to fight to stop India's independence for Britain and America. There is no reason to justify this in terms of reason or morality. If Chongqing's Chiang Kai-shek does not wake up, his failure is predictable.</p>
<p>On the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, recalling the oppression suffered by the East Asian peoples under British and American rule in the past, and the spirit of the soldiers shedding blood on the front lines, we firmly believe that the liberation of the East Asian nations will be completed. The greater the degree to which a nation endures suffering, the greater the certainty of victory in the war. Our East Asian nations have the inherent qualities of perseverance and a spirit of enduring hardship. If we can unite sincerely, the power we unleash will be irresistible to any enemy.</p>
<p>However, finally, I still hope that my East Asian compatriots will not take the Greater East Asia War too lightly. During this period, regardless of when this war ends, each of us East Asian compatriots must do their best and contribute everything possible to the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, we must especially pay attention to what I said at the beginning: we only have national distinctions, but in terms of the whole of East Asia, we can also be said to be brothers in a large family. We only have distinctions of strength and size, but we must achieve emotional unity and have no gaps between us in order to shoulder this great mission. The shortcomings most easily exposed among nations, such as the strong having an excessive sense of superiority, often showing arrogance and looking down on weaker nations, and the weak believing that their abilities are weak, and belittling themselves and lacking self-confidence, are all obstacles to spiritual unity and seeking liberation together. We must find ways to overcome and eliminate them.</p>
<p>The above is nothing more than commonplace remarks. I hope you will correct me. Finally, I wish for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of all East Asian nations.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Mr. Takeouchi Fumio of Japan Speaks: Two Factors for the Success of Greater East Asia <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<h3 id="e47">Japan and Asian Nations Cooperate in Parliament — Speech by Mr. Takeouchi Fumio: <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Briefly stated: "On this day two years ago, I was in Tokyo. That day was when Japan declared war on Britain and America. The mood in Tokyo was extremely excited. One day after the start of the war, the Japanese army achieved unprecedented great victories. Every citizen was excited. We immediately felt a new belief that we would win this war, and through this war, East Asia would definitely be united in the future. This has been fully realized, and we have today's grand gathering and today's status. Last month, the historically rare Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued. Everyone is working together and moving towards a consistent goal. The East Asian nations are united, so this unity of East Asians was determined early after the start of the war. Therefore, after three years, the East Asian nations can discuss matters together. At the same time, there is another point that was not expected, that is, after the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the Indian National Army and the Japanese army took joint steps to destroy the British and American enemies. This is very gratifying. The victory of the Greater East Asia War is really a blessing from heaven. It is an inevitable event in history, and the unification of the East Asian nations is also an inevitable event in history. Therefore, we must review how to address the Greater East Asia issue in the future. I think it can be divided into two factors for success: 1. The power of Asia has developed vigorously. 2. The general outstanding talents of Asia have fully realized. Asians inherently have talent and occupy an important position in the world. Due to years of oppression, invasion, and manipulation by Britain and America, the activity of Asians, who inherently possessed talent, was concealed. Until after the Russo-Japanese War, the genius and talent of Asians had a clear realization, and they had the belief of uniting and generating strength. They regarded Asians as oppressed peoples and sought self-improvement and strength. Therefore, the discovery of the genius of Asians and the recent unity can be said to have the Russo-Japanese War as the cause, and the current Greater East Asia War as the result. Therefore, how can the genius of Asians be used and contributed to East Asia and to the peace of the world? Therefore, we should resolutely contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War and strive hard. With this determination, and relying on strength to do it, we will definitely be able to destroy the British and American invasion and achieve success." Finally, Mr. Takeouchi mentioned the images he had seen in Tokyo in the past month regarding the strengthening of domestic production, the rapid progress of national defense, economic aircraft production, and the abundance of military preparations. Therefore, it is not far off that we will eliminate the British and American forces, expel them from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and completely destroy them. At the same time, we must work harder to completely annihilate Britain and America, so that all East Asian nations can live in peace in their own places, to establish the completion of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and further establish a world co-prosperity sphere, to build a new world and a new order. He particularly emphasized that there is only one Asia united in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Mr. Osaka Yoichi of Japan Speaks: New Belief in the Victory of Greater East Asia <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<h3 id="e49">Mr. Osaka Yoichi, representative of the Continental News, speaks briefly: <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>"In the world war, there has never been seen such a spirit of righteousness among East Asian nations as in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, after Japan opened the prelude, the Greater East Asia War liberated sixteen East Asian nations and created a new world and a new history, a brilliant one. I returned to my country for a month this time and just returned the day before yesterday. This trip has given me a new belief that the Greater East Asia War will definitely be victorious. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will definitely be completed. However, in order to achieve this, we must also make the greatest effort. Japan has been established for more than 2,600 years and has achieved today's great achievements, revealing a world-rare history. This is enough to show the determination of the 100 million people of Japan to contribute their strength to the country and strive for victory." Mr. Osaka also introduced the service of the people in Japan for the country. There are no useless talents in Japan, and they have the spirit of courageously moving forward, serving, and striving for the victory of the war. Mr. Kwan also confirmed that Mr. Takeouchi's proposal that there is only one Asia was deeply agreed upon. He said that Asia must have a strong unity to achieve its goals, create a large family, and become one. Therefore, in this era, we must have this belief to serve the country. In this great historical era, it is very glorious. At the same time, our responsibilities are arduous, to liberate the sixteen East Asian nations, to achieve freedom and independence, and we must have confidence in the struggle. Not only Japan, but China and all nations are united and moving towards a common goal, and we must all join hands and work together to create a new history, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Mr. Yeh Yao-kung of Manchukuo Speaks: Consolidate the New Unity of East Asian Nations <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<h3 id="e51">Mr. Yeh Yao-kung, Consul General and representative of Manchukuo, spoke as follows: <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>"Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Today, the Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference is being held. I am honored to have the opportunity to participate in this grand meeting as a representative of the Manchukuo Concordia Association and to express my thoughts. Most of the nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which has a population of one billion, have experienced economic or political oppression under the aggressive policies of foreign imperialists led by Britain and America for a long time in the past. During that period, many national heroes came out several times to raise the banner of liberation, but from the perspective of doctrine, they were not of the Mahayana type and were limited to local and group activities. The liberation of the East Asian nations has not yet achieved victory. The reason is that there is no central country with rich guidance and the ability to implement far-reaching plans and lead the nations. However, the Great Japanese Empire, which envisions eternal peace and co-prosperity for East Asia, displays the spirit of Hakkō ichiu. The first is the Manchurian Incident, the second is the China Incident, and the third is the Greater East Asia War. It can be said that it is an unprecedented innovative stage in East Asian history, firmly advancing the liberation of East Asian nations and assisting the independence of national countries. Therefore, there is the birth of Manchukuo, the establishment of the new regime of the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China, the assistance to Thailand, the complete independence of Burma, and the independence of the Philippines. Furthermore, it has developed into the great cause of the liberation of the Indian nation. This fact is a glorious century undertaking that we could not have imagined. Only the Great Japanese Empire can make it a reality. Therefore, recalling the events of twelve years ago in our Manchukuo, at that time, based on the total will of the 30 million people who rose up enthusiastically, and relying on the Great Japanese Empire's great righteousness, we established an independent country. For twelve years until today, we have been working wholeheartedly and continuously on national construction based on the spirit of national harmony. Last autumn, we blessed the first phase of basic construction for ten years. On this basis, we entered the second phase of construction. Now, the development of the domestic economy and industry has reached an extremely astonishing level. At the same time, in the position of a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we bear the heavy responsibility of guarding the north militarily, and we are promoting the spirit of harmony politically to devote ourselves to the construction of this righteous world. I think of the great achievements of national construction over the past twelve years and can only be grateful for the infinite righteous assistance provided by the Japanese Empire during this period. I look back on the new history of our country and therefore think of the liberation of the East Asian nations that followed us. I hope that the sacred intention of the Japanese Empire today will not be fruitless. We should conduct mutually solid progress with the Japanese Empire as the guiding country, complete the unity of the East Asian nations, and consolidate the foundation of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, making East Asia the crown of the sacred land of the world. Now the Greater East Asia War is still in full swing, and the situation is not so simple. We must contribute to the rear area tasks of the Japanese Imperial Army. The East Asian nations will surely realize the liberation of the East Asian nations with the efforts of Japan, and we must understand and strengthen this new unity. This is what I most believe. Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Because of this significance, it is truly gratifying to hold the East Asia National Representatives Conference today in Shanghai, the international city of East Asia. May I hereby pray for the success of the struggle of the East Asian nations."</p>

<h3 id="e53">Central News Agency Report: <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>At the Shanghai Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference, Mr. Wei Xian, Chairman of the Philippine Association and representative of the Philippines, spoke as follows: "East Asian brothers: A year ago today, representatives of various East Asian groups in Shanghai gathered at this time and place to express their heartfelt joy and happiness at the glorious victories won by Japan in its early heroic struggle to drive out Britain and America from East Asia. I was also honored to be present at that memorable event. At that time, we prayed for further victories for Japan, so that one day in the future, other East Asian nations would be rescued from their shackles and liberated from the tyranny of British and American imperialism. At that time, as an East Asian, I felt very happy, carrying the glory of an East Asian. But what about today? As a citizen of the Philippines, with the heart of a Filipino, I am even happier. It was only recently that we, under the rule of Westerners, first Spain and then the United States, groaned and became haggard. Now our motherland has finally broken free from its shackles and gained independence. What makes me happy is that last year, our wishes and prayers seemed to be like an old horse that knows the way, carrying us straight to the path of victory. You see, China has restored its sovereignty, the Philippine people have been revived, India has its free provisional government, Malaya and the islands of Southeast Asia have recovered their prosperity, and all East Asian nations are gloriously bathed in the light of eternal freedom. They have new hope, greater national self-esteem, and a resurgent sense of self-confidence and justice. A new East Asia has emerged. All these earth-shattering events have occurred one after another following Japan's repeated victories. Today's celebration is even more significant than the great victory we celebrated last year.

<h3 id="e55">Central News Agency Report: <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>At the Shanghai Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference, Mr. Chotram Partabrai Gidwani, Head of Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League and Representative of India, spoke briefly: "Two years ago, Japan defeated Britain and America in a very short time to liberate Asia, driving Britain and America out of various battlefields such as Hong Kong, Malaya, the Philippines, East Indies, and Burma. The British and American base of two hundred years, Syonan-to, is also free of enemies. The brave and invincible Japanese army, with its spirit of fearing no death, has shaken the world stage. At the same time, the thing that makes us Indians most happy is that the Indian army will no longer be oppressed by the British in the future, and will fight alongside the Japanese army in Hong Kong and Burma for the blood of political freedom and independence. On January 9 of this year, the Chinese National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War and declared war on Britain and America. In this year, China not only gained complete freedom and independence, but also recovered the concessions, eliminating the illegal places where British and American enemies hid their dirt and filth. We believe that one day, Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing will realize that he has gone astray, that Britain and America are splitting up, and that he will return to Asia and join hands with the same enemies. The Japanese government has been assisting Burma and the Philippines to gain independence this year, and at the Greater East Asia Conference, Prime Minister Tōjō announced that he would return the Paracel and Nicobar Islands to the Indian Provisional Free Government. This shows that Japan has no ambitions and sincerely assists India's independence and seeks India's liberation. This June, Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose came from Berlin to the East to work hard for the liberation of India. He arrived in Syonan and established the Indian National Army, with the slogan "Return to New Delhi," and fought alongside the Japanese army, fighting the common enemies of East Asia, Britain and America. On the 23rd of this month, the Indian Provisional Government declared war on Britain and America. We will shed our blood and destroy the symptoms of England until we achieve freedom. As we celebrate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, it further increases our strength and strengthens our confidence in victory. On this day next year, our two-colored Indian flag will definitely be raised in New Delhi."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Restoring the Psychology of Trust and Peace — A Prerequisite for Achieving Overall Peace <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Lukan</p>
<p>The China Alliance has been established, and new treaties of equality and mutual benefit have been produced. What the people of both countries are watching and naturally expect is the issue of overall peace. But if we say that this issue is difficult to achieve, it is because, based on observing the psychology of the people, except for the Communist Party who spread red ideology, the Chiang regime who blindly believes in Britain and America, and the speculators who make a fortune from the national crisis, I dare say that there is not a single person who does not yearn for peace. Those who are in the midst of war and suffer all kinds of disasters, needless to say, even the people living in cities, saturated with economic oppression, lack of goods, traffic congestion, and all kinds of suffering, who does not harbor the thought of "living in peace" and not being a displaced person? Based on this view, peace should have been achieved long ago. Why is it that even today, the road ahead is still hazy and difficult to grasp? I think that although there are many people who hope for peace, there are really too few who trust in peace. Because there are too few people who trust in peace, overall peace cannot be achieved. Under today's circumstances, if we want to achieve overall peace, besides the Chinese and Japanese sides quickly correcting the errors of the past and present, and causing the people to have a solid sense of trust in peace, there is no other way to go.</p>
<p>From our side's point of view, the government's errors towards the people are not to be concealed. They are really obvious. First, there are many gatherings, many proposals, few implementations, and few achievements. Second, the appointment of officials has no standards and is half-based on personal relationships. Third, orders change from morning to evening, making people at a loss. Fourth, there is no representative body, and feelings have no way to reach the top. Fifth, corruption is discovered, but those who abuse their power are not severely punished.</p>
<p>Having said this, perhaps some people will refute me, saying: "The inability of the Chongqing side to join the peace is not an expression of public opinion, but is due to the coercion of the Chiang regime's military power. Moreover, there is also the Yan'an Communist government, which has no hope of leaning towards peace." These kinds of arguments cannot be said to be completely without basis. But in reality, the soldiers of the Chongqing side are also recruited from the people. If the hearts of the people are completely scattered, from where will military power be exerted? During the Xinhai Revolution, the elite and sharp weapons were all in the north. But a small team of people in the 8th Battalion of the Engineering Corps ignited the fuse, and in less than four months, they overthrew the Qing government. In the Northern Expedition that year, the military strength of Wu, Sun, and Zhang was in a ratio of seven to three compared to the people's army. However, once the hearts of the people were lost, the Nationalist Party achieved complete success in a short time. These are all recent facts that can serve as a warning. Regarding the internal situation of the Chongqing side, except for Song, Kong and their ilk, who have too deep personal economic ties with Britain and America, and are trying to get rid of them, other military leaders, such as He Jingzhi, are very reluctant to resist Japan. Yang Gengguang once said, "Our commander's military knowledge is not enough to be a brigade commander, and it is still a question." The psychology of the high-ranking officers of the Chongqing side can be imagined from this. The strength of the Gui clique has long been weakened to the point where little remains. Most of the Sichuan clique are riding on two horses, and in view of the death of Liu Fuchen, most of them are a little disheartened. The leader of the Yunnan clique, Long Yun, has long reached the point of superficial agreement and internal divergence with Chiang Kai-shek. As long as the current government really has a way, and the allied nations are extremely sincere and the workers' party changes, perhaps Chiang Kai-shek will have to go abroad to be a government in exile. As for the entire group of Communists, they will not participate in the peace, but that does not matter, because our national system and customs have no reason to accept communism. If the Nationalist government could have truly eradicated the remnants of the Beiyang warlords when it was established, started anew with the people, established a clean, upright, and just system, and practiced the Three Principles of the People, the Communist Party would not have been able to exist long ago. Unfortunately, besides raising party power, nothing else was done that day. They took the opportunity to easily incite the masses. As long as the government learns from the past and reinvigorates the future, gains the trust of the people, even if the Chongqing side has British and American support, it will inevitably disintegrate, and the Communist Party will not be difficult to eradicate. At the latest, within a year or two, overall peace will inevitably be achieved.</p>
<p>From the friendly nations' point of view, of course, their governments and people hope that our country will achieve overall peace as soon as possible, so that they can unite to deal with Britain and America. I am now putting forward three points, which seem to require review. First, according to the various expressions of the allied nations' governments to us, it can be said that they are benevolent and righteous to the extreme, and there is nothing they have not considered. However, looking at the real situation in the current peaceful areas, whether everything conforms to the announcements issued by the Japanese government, and whether the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation among the military and political authorities of the allied nations is consistent? Perhaps because there are few people and many things, or because of language barriers, the Chinese staff employed are of uneven quality, and it can be said that there are more weeds than good grain. These people rely on their ability to understand Japanese and get close to the authorities, and inevitably take advantage of their power to bully others, and even engage in fraud and embezzlement from time to time. Money all goes to them, while the people's resentment accumulates towards the allied nations. Recently, the military police have detected a fraud case involving as much as 200,000 yuan, which shows that the friendly army has long been aware of it, but unfortunately, there are still many similar matters. In particular, there are many cases of using public undertakings as a pretext to commit fraud and harm the public. Conscience dictates that most people in the allied nations are able to exercise self-control. But it is hoped that they will use fewer flashy and cunning employees, and pay close attention to the behavior of these people on weekdays, and firmly adhere to the principle of punishing those who commit crimes and punishing them severely. Naturally, good people will be blessed, and the realization of peace will be more promising. Second, among the foreigners who come to China, there is no doubt that merchants have the closest contact with society. If merchants can sincerely express goodwill to the residents, one person will tell ten, and ten people will tell a hundred, and the influence will be quick and great. Now I would also like to put forward three opinions, hoping that the merchants of the allied nations will review them: (A) The organizational content of major merchants such as banks and companies is mostly westernized. Most of the people in charge are fluent in English, and those who understand Chinese are secondary. There is already a slight estrangement. In addition, British and American merchants used to treat Chinese people arrogantly. It seems that the merchants of the allied nations have not been able to completely change this habit, and they look down on Chinese people more than Westerners. Of course, this kind of situation is not the case for every family, but I hope that if there is such a case, it will be corrected. (B) In jointly organized undertakings, apart from personnel and general affairs, the Chinese side has no real power at all, as if it were the system of employing compradors in foreign firms in the past. I ask, which truly wealthy and talented merchant would be willing to work within this scope? This is the second point I hope to correct. (C) Most of the merchants who come to China to operate in the beginning recruit Chinese partners to facilitate their operations because they are unfamiliar with the place or have language barriers. However, honest and kind people are timid and dare not join, or they misunderstand rumors and do not intend to invest. As a result, a group of hooligans and swindlers take the opportunity to rise up, pretending to be partners on the one hand to deceive their compatriots, and on the other hand taking advantage of the partners' ignorance of Chinese customs to commit all kinds of fraud. When the day comes when the accounts are overturned or the funds are lost, the people blame the Japanese merchants. Such things are not seen in the north. In the future, it seems that we should pay more attention to being careful at the beginning in order to be able to see things through to the end. This is the third point I hope to correct. The above three points seem to be minor details, but they are most likely to arouse social resentment and are also a major obstacle to the entire peace. I deeply hope that the merchant friends of the allied nations will pay special attention.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Dawn of Comprehensive Peace <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shuomei</p>
<p>The call for comprehensive peace has long resonated to the heavens, and the work of implementing comprehensive peace has also been well underway. The National Government, in its position of cooperating with its ally Japan, aims to strike down England and America, and will naturally contribute everything, using the highest degree of ability, determined not to recognize the existence of the Chongqing regime. Moreover, at this stage of the peace movement, having obtained such a just treaty, the object of resistance has completely disappeared, and there is absolutely no reason to blindly delay. The people of our country have always demanded the withdrawal of troops as a condition for peace. Now our ally Japan not only allows the withdrawal of troops, but also completely abandons the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol. The key to comprehensive peace lies entirely with Chongqing. As long as Chongqing abandons resistance, comprehensive peace can be realized.</p>
<p>The Chongqing side has repeatedly and publicly stated: "Peace can only be achieved by returning to the status quo before the incident." Judging from the current situation, the content of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty not only restores the situation to what it was before this incident, but actually exceeds it several times over. So, what is the basis for the arguments of those who advocate resistance?</p>
<p>However, the reason why comprehensive peace has not yet been achieved is partly due to the violent hijacking by the Chiang clique and the obstruction by the Communist Party. However, a major reason is also that the current strength of the National Government has not yet been universally developed. Since the return to the capital...</p>
<p>However, the people can also be angered for the sake of their own survival and the safety of their country. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and even the declaration of war against England and America, the Chinese government has been seeking the independence of the Republic of China, and the Chinese people have been fighting for the survival of the nation. If China had not fought Japan at the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China could never have become an independent country. Similarly, if China had not fought with England and America on January 9, China would never have become an independent country. Moreover, what is at stake goes beyond China, as the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the Greater East Asia Holy War are the foundation for the liberation of Asia.</p>
<p>What does this mean? As the saying goes, "No fight, no deal." Seven years ago, the relationship between China and Japan had many areas of discord. If China had not resolutely resisted Japan, the relationship between China and Japan would probably never have reached the point of mutual understanding that it has today. Witnessing the people of two countries of the same culture fighting each other in the depths of suffering, destroying the national strength of both countries, men of vision have long felt the pain. It is amidst this pity that the people of both countries gradually realized the wrongness of mutual slaughter, and thus came the Konoe Statement, Chairman Wang's telegram, the gradual release of tensions, and the fruit of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, which blossomed from the flowers of true and righteous friendship. Therefore, the resistance at the Marco Polo Bridge was indeed a medium for mutual understanding between China and Japan. Now that China and Japan are upholding each other in the spirit of righteousness, the former enemy has become today's friend. Why is the Chongqing government still not awake?</p>
<p>Anyone who endangers China's independence and freedom is China's enemy. Japan used to be an enemy, but now it is an ally. The Chongqing government certainly knows that England and America are harmful to China, but they still rely on them and fight Japan because they still believe that Japan is China's greatest enemy. If this concept cannot be broken, comprehensive peace cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>In fact, Japan respects China's independence and equality more than England and America. Just look at the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty that has been signed this time, its significance is so far-reaching. England and America are merely engaging in a clumsy imitation, returning concessions and abolishing consular jurisdiction, which is as ridiculous as the United States falsely promising independence to the Filipinos after the independence of the Philippines. Their hypocrisy is so obvious that even a three-year-old child would not be fooled.</p>
<p>However, in our opinion, there are two reasons why the Chongqing government does not awaken:</p>
<p>They are forced by England and America and cannot turn back.</p>
<p>They cannot trust Japan and lack ambition for the construction of East Asia.</p>
<p>The latter is the primary reason. Therefore, if we want Chongqing to return willingly, we can only prove with facts that Japan treats China as an equal. This can be discussed in two aspects.</p>
<p>The hatred of Japan among the Chinese people has been ingrained in their minds for many years. These prejudiced views can only be overcome by using propaganda to promote friendship between China and Japan. At the same time, friendly countries should also change their past attitudes so that China and Japan can gradually embark on the path of genuine respect, understanding, and even love.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, Japan should help China become a truly strong and independent country. It is obvious that East Asia cannot be called completely liberated until China is strong.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>The traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy has achieved unprecedented feats in world naval history. This spirit is admired by both friend and foe. The famous Japanese writer Iwata Toyoo devoted all his energy to write the book "Navy" for the Asahi Shimbun, vividly conveying the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. It was published daily in the newspaper, widely circulated, and made into a movie. Now, this newspaper has translated it and will publish it daily. We hope readers will pay attention.</p>
<p>A Man</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>In 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was established. The citizens of Paris tore up pieces of paper from all the windows and threw them down, symbolizing the auspicious snow of victory. Their feeling was not so much the joy of victory as it was the welcome of peace. On November 18 of that year, a boy was born to Shinichi Taniguchi, a rice merchant in Arita Town, Kagoshima City.</p>
<p>In front of the store facing Taniyama Street, Shinichi, holding a dustpan, knew about the birth before he was told, because of the high-pitched and intense birth cry.</p>
<p>"Is it a boy?"</p>
<p>The fifty-year-old father's face showed no expression. He continued to handle the dustpan full of rice flour.</p>
<p>Shinichi was not like a businessman. He was a man of few words. He held the rank of Private First Class in the Konoe Cavalry and had served in both the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. However, when he heard of the birth of the boy, he was as silent as a forest. This was not only because of his experiences and nature, but also for other reasons.</p>
<p>He, his wife, had grown accustomed to the birth of children. This was the eleventh birth. Five girls, five boys, none died young, all grew up healthy. Moreover, the births were very easy. The children were like the fruits of the persimmon tree in the garden, born naturally and simply, one by one. Now, another one has been added—a boy.</p>
<p>Shinichi calmly accepted the birth of the child. Although the local custom was to be ashamed of having many children, they were not disgusted by it. Of course, the family was not very wealthy, but because there was a custom of treating children as a gift from heaven, no matter how many were born, there was not a word of complaint, especially since this time it was a boy. Although it was already the era of 1919, in the Satsuma region, the disparity in value between the sexes was still very severe.</p>
<p>(A boy was born...)</p>
<p>Shinichi was thinking about what to name him. The eldest daughter was named Haruko, and the second daughter was named Mitsuko—girls' names could be given very casually. But boys' names required more thought. The eldest son was named Shinzo, and the second son was named Shinichiro—these were easy. The ones born later were troublesome. The fourth son was named Shikichi, which was not bad. The fifth son was named Taro, which was a bit rough.</p>
<p>This time, no matter what, he wanted to give him an auspicious name. Why? Because this child's name seemed like it couldn't be too casual!</p>
<p>(Shin, Shin, Shin Jin! Good!)</p>
<p>Strangely, a good name that slipped out of his mouth came to mind. Shin Jin, Taniguchi Shin Jin! One of the 83 Satsuma loyalists had that name. This was no ordinary name. At that time, Shinichi's family was still commoners.</p>

<p>England and America, which suffered a major defeat in the war, realized the disadvantage of prolonged attrition and quickly changed the entire wartime situation, using their huge resources to launch a desperate counterattack. Today, fierce battles are being waged day and night in the southern strongholds.</p>
<p>England and America's overall counteroffensive against Japan, in addition to the southern strongholds, also focuses on the counteroffensive in Burma and the counteroffensive from mainland China, driving Chongqing to engage in anti-Japanese resistance to the end. Using the US Air Force stationed in China, they attempt to directly bomb the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>Chongqing also violates East Asian history on its own, continues to resist, and hopes for the victory of the Anglo-American alliance, gradually giving territory to the American army, hoping that external forces will crush Japan.</p>
<p>Thus, the current situation of the war on the Chinese mainland is in a complex state. At the same time, the position of the China front in the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>In the second year of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to its original task of destroying the Nationalist army, the Japanese army also carried out increasingly active operations against the Communist army, and to the activities of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, they acted ahead of their plans, seized the initiative, and closed off the air routes to bombing the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>Let us now examine the results of the operations over the past year:</p>
<p>The operational results of the Expeditionary Force over the past year.</p>
<p>The main battles in North China included the Taihang Operation in 1937 and the Autumn Communist Suppression Operation; in Central China, there were the Dabie Mountain Operation and the Spring and Summer Offensive Operations, and the Southwest Taihu Lake Area Operation. In addition, there were active and vigorous activities in Xinjiang, Central China, North China, and South China.</p>
<p>Now, let us summarize the results:</p>
<p>A. The number of engagements was 22,000, with an average of 1,900 per month, or about 67 per day. This seems to be a decrease compared to the 25,000 in the previous year, but the number of Japanese troops dispatched did not differ much. This shows that the enemy is trying to avoid engagement as much as possible.</p>
<p>B. The number of enemy troops engaged was approximately 3,300,000, which is less than the 3,600,000 in the previous year. This indicates the difficulty of replenishing enemy troops.</p>
<p>C. The number of enemy soldiers killed was approximately 210,000, and the number of captured and surrendered was approximately 170,000. The ratio of the latter to the former is approximately 80%. This is a significant increase in the number of captured and surrendered compared to the 12% in 1937, 29% in 1938, and 44% in 1939. This clearly shows how low the enemy's morale is.</p>
<p>D. In terms of captured equipment, artillery and heavy weapons are decreasing, which proves the difficulty of replenishing enemy equipment after being cut off, and that they are using inferior equipment; while the increase in swords and spears shows that they are fighting with unconventional weapons.</p>
<p>E. In the air war, 148 enemy aircraft were shot down, 62 were set on fire in the air, and 41 were shot down by ground fire, totaling 251. Of these, the majority were US Air Force aircraft. It is now estimated that the enemy's current strength is approximately 250 aircraft. Thus, the enemy's air force has been almost completely destroyed.</p>

<p>— Lieutenant Commander Shioda</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Before August of last year, when the enemy launched a general counteroffensive from the Solomon Islands, the war history of the Japanese Navy was like a prairie fire, like water flowing downhill, and could be described as unprecedented. The surprise attack on Hawaii, the Battle of Malaya, the capture of Guam, the Battle of the Java Sea, the capture of Singapore, the Battle of Bali, Surabaya, the Battle of Batavia, the Battle of the Indian Ocean, the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the Battle of Midway, etc. In the first two battles, the enemy's main fleet was destroyed at the beginning of the war, cutting the enemy's combat power in half. Then, the HMS Prince of Wales was sunk, crushing the enemy's huge combat power in East Asia. The latter directed the elite spearhead to the enemy's outer front, broke into the enemy's base, and successively concentrated on island-hopping attacks, until the First Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 14 of last year. In one fell swoop, the battle line was extended by 3,000 kilometers to the west and south. During this period, eight enemy battleships and eight aircraft carriers were sunk. Japanese damage was limited to three aircraft carriers (including one small aircraft carrier and one seaplane carrier), resulting in a great victory. From a strategic point of view, up to this point, it could be called the first phase of the operation, or the attack phase. In short, the largest point attacked by the Japanese naval force in the first phase was the Solomon Islands. To further block the connection between the United States and Australia, and to completely cut off transportation between Australia and Hawaii, it was necessary to set up important replenishment bases in the south.</p>
<p>After this, it inevitably entered the second stage: protecting the southern treasure house. Adding bases, occupying various strongholds to smash the enemy's offensive power, forming a defensive posture. The decisive battle of Guadalcanal, the battles of Irovela, Lunga, the first to third battles of the Solomon Islands, and the Battle of the South Pacific were all naval battles aimed at occupying strongholds and smashing the enemy's counteroffensive. Recent battles, such as the first to sixth air and sea battles of Bougainville Island, are in some sense of the same nature as the Solomon Islands battle.</p>
<p>Why Obtain Great Victory</p>
<p>So, where did the glorious war results since the beginning of the war come from? It was due to the belief in certain victory created by training and the spirit of destroying the enemy based on this belief. This is the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. The belief in certain victory is not only produced by indoor education or armchair strategizing, but is actually born from continuous training, being confident that you can defeat the enemy. Hours after attacking Tulagi during the First Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 8 last year. At 5:15 pm, as the mine warfare ship was advancing, the coaching bugle rang, and training began. This training took place at the same time every day, until today, so even in the spare time during the attack on Tulagi, training also began at the same time. In this way, one shot will certainly hit, and Marshal Togo's teaching, "One cannon that hits with one shot is better than one hundred cannons that hit with one shot," can be realized.</p>
<p>But even with such training, if it is not propelled by a great spiritual force during combat, results cannot be expected. The traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy for seventy years, "Do not die until the enemy is defeated," has become the belief of "Kill without fail upon seeing the enemy," and has further developed into the belief of "Seek the enemy and kill without fail." Based on this belief, there arose warriors who fought as ten against one, or as one plane against twenty, or who self-exploded towards enemy warships.</p>
<p>Due to the Washington Conference, being forced into a disadvantageous ratio of 5:5:3, new aircraft carriers, which the world's shipbuilding movement focused on, could only be created through remodeling, on the road to self-destruction. From then on, the Japanese Navy devoted all its energy to the remodeling of weapons, the thoroughness of training, and the research of tactics. Japan also noticed that in the future, it would inevitably have to confront England and the United States at a ratio of 3:10, so it put the greatest effort into the quality of weapons. As a result, in this war, it proved how excellent Japanese weapons are.</p>
<p>First, Japan has special submarines. In Hawaii, in Sydney, in Madagascar, making the enemy weary, and many other new weapons are also being constantly researched. Speaking of aircraft, the excellence of Japanese naval fighters has long been established by the American side--the United States has always boasted that its weapons are the best in the world, but the appearance of Japanese naval fighters has also made them quite troubled. The enemy particularly emphasized the number of Japanese naval aircraft destroyed in each naval and air battle, which shows that the enemy has more fear of Japanese fighters than imagined. In August of this year, enemy reports claimed that Japan was using new fighters on the New Guinea front, urging their country to accelerate the manufacture of excellent aircraft. All wars cause weapons to develop surprisingly, which was already evident in the previous Great War. In particular, the progress of modern aircraft is astonishing. Yesterday's aircraft are already outdated in today's battles. Today's aircraft cannot be the front-line aircraft of tomorrow. In the field of aircraft, especially fighters, Japan's excellence is often ahead of the enemy. Also, large cruisers (over 10,000 tons) have been sunk in air battles in which war results were obtained each time, which shows that torpedoes are also quite advanced.</p>
<p>Secondly, the tactical research and the far-sighted operations of the Supreme Command must be mentioned. Recently, the operations carried out in the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands have caused American military commentators to marvel at the Japanese fleet's operations, calling them whimsical. As with the surprise attack on Hawaii, the attack on Singapore, and the Battle of the Coral Sea, Japan often caught the enemy off guard. Its great war results have left a great war history in subsequent tactics. Also, looking at the history of naval battles over the past two years, the naval battles of Hawaii and the Coral Sea have had a great impact on the enemy, causing England and the United States to change their warship building plans.</p>
<p>The naval battles of the Coral Sea and Midway were manifestations of the Japanese Navy's traditional spirit of attacking the enemy, while the naval battles in the Guadalcanal area, especially the night battle of Lunga, showed that the Japanese Navy had strong confidence in both offensive and defensive tactics. The withdrawal from Guadalcanal was a reorganization and strengthening of the internal battle lines in preparation for the next phase of operations after the mission was completed. The brave decision of the Japanese Supreme Command for this withdrawal operation is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Japanese naval force is composed of material and human elements. The human element can be divided into officers and non-commissioned officers, and non-commissioned officers can be further divided into conscripts and volunteers. Non-commissioned officers are actually the foundation of naval strength. The glorious war results obtained are due to these non-commissioned officers, who become the hands and feet of the officers, allowing them to conduct battles calmly and accurately, so that they can defeat ten or fifteen enemies with one. The navy has put a lot of research and effort into cultivating these excellent non-commissioned officers.</p>
<p>Tactics call for the benefits of timing, terrain, and people. In the Japanese Navy, the captain is the father and the executive officer is the mother. It is a family on the warship, and life and death are one. The combat power produced by the unity of people enables the inferior to defeat enemies several times their number.</p>
<p>The Nature of Modern Naval Warfare</p>
<p>The fighting spirit of the navy emphasizes the first five minutes and the last five minutes the most. This is what is required by the uniqueness of naval warfare, which is different from land warfare. Until the withdrawal from Guadalcanal in August of last year, it was only about halfway through, and it was actually the opening battle. After the determination of the military force of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, to ensure the continued supply for the next stage of battle, Japan seized the enemy's outposts one by one from the base. Its speed and war results have established an unprecedented and great pyramid. In short, the initial purpose was to secure the resources to carry out the war. On the other hand, what was advantageous for Japan was precisely the deprivation of England and the United States' ability to carry out combat. Under Japan's control of the sea and air, it obtained unlimited wartime necessities such as aluminum, oil, rubber, tin, and iron. With this, Japan was able to prepare a system that could win independently in any war production, ensuring the treasure house from the Philippines in the north to Java in the south, from Celebes in the east to the western ... one ... place. At the same time, it meant breaking into another strategic stage.</p>
<p>The second stage of defensive warfare is the battle to enhance combat power. The result of the opening battle was not only to secure military resources, but also to ensure a situation of certain victory and invincibility on the base and strategically. The southern islands played a great role in the enemy's counteroffensive operations. The above-mentioned military resources and strategic advantages were, of course, disadvantages for England and the United States. On the other hand, if the opening battle is further analyzed, Japan and England and the United States have long been hypothetical enemy countries, and have been constantly researching all weapons and tactics, exhausting their secrets, which were fully utilized in the opening battle period. From the enemy's point of view, all of the enemy's main ships before the war were completely sunk, and the various types of ships used in the second stage are new or warships of unknown types.</p>
<p>Before the war, the United States adopted the doctrine of large ships with giant cannons, thinking that a huge fleet was necessary on the vast Pacific Ocean. However, after the end of the war, they deeply realized the serious errors in their shipbuilding policy. Because there are countless islands in the Pacific Ocean. The combat strategy adopted based on all the assumptions established at sea turned out to be that large battleships were not suitable. That island is sometimes more useful than a battleship. It is an unsinkable aircraft carrier. Also, because these islands can be used as important bases and supply points, the United States is now deeply regretting the great mistakes of the war. Their control of the sea and air has been taken away. Countless large and small islands from the Malay Peninsula to the Solomon Islands have now become Japan's unsinkable aircraft carriers, becoming powerful warships, with the advantage of internal operations.

<h3 id="e63">Going East <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Komatsu Kitamura</p>
<p>From West to East</p>
<p>We know there is a fleet of enemy supply ships! Including three aircraft carriers, far away from the motherland of a certain country, advancing across the ocean. Meanwhile, we take off in our planes and fly east.</p>
<p>I, along with a part of the 〇〇 unit of the British Navy, which holds sway over the Indian Ocean, embark on the final leg of a 3,400-mile voyage. Although this 3,400-mile journey is merely a small distance from one point on Earth to another, it is by no means insignificant. Nevertheless, being so far removed, I cannot help but feel that the distance flown by humans is by no means short.</p>
<p>An American correspondent criticized our army's operations, saying: "The Japanese army has forgotten the concept of distance in its operations."</p>
<p>Engaged in this battle, crossing the equator south, then returning north, traveling hundreds of miles west, and then hundreds of miles east, I deeply feel that our army, forgetting the concept of distance, searches for the enemy, captures the enemy, and begins battle. But before defeating the enemy, the concept of "distance" is deeply imprinted in our minds, and we fight against distance, overcoming it.</p>
<p>I must say that their operational concept uses the forests of Malaya as a shield, and relies on the vastness of the sea, conducting operations in a manner vastly different from our own.</p>
<p>Here, I am reminded of the story of Timur.</p>
<p>The Dutch soldiers defending Timur said:</p>
<p>"The Japanese army is cowardly!"</p>
<p>When asked, "Why?"</p>
<p>"The Japanese army never attacks our heavily fortified positions with barbed wire head-on. They unexpectedly attack us from our sides and rear in the dead of night. This is not a formal battle..."</p>
<p>—This is not idle talk. We are not playing a game or competing; we are at war. We are not playing at war like the British and Americans. This also reveals the difference between their concepts and ours.</p>
<p>Readers have likely read the notes of a naval reporter who flew on a search mission over the distant Indian Ocean!</p>
<p>In those notes, readers can sense how the navy fights against this great "distance" before engaging in battle.</p>
<p>Whether it was the Battle of Hawaii, the Battle of Malaya, or the Battle of Java, our army never forgot distance. On the contrary, with the concept of "distance" in mind, we achieved these great victories through the mental strength and mobility to overcome that distance.</p>
<p>I think of the seas I have crossed and the skies I have flown through so far. That sky is indeed a vast sky. That sea is indeed a boundless sea.</p>
<p>On the Waves</p>
<p>"Lights out for battle!"</p>
<p>At sunset, this voice of the sailor on duty is heard throughout the ship.</p>
<p>The windows are completely closed with iron doors, and the window glass is covered with thick blackout curtains. The lights inside the ship must be controlled to the bare minimum.</p>
<p>"It must be cool on a warship sailing on the sea!"</p>
<p>Some might think of saying such a thing, but this is as much of a misconception as saying, "If you go to the sea, you can eat a lot of fish..."</p>
<p>Such a statement is as inappropriate as saying, "If you fly in a plane, you can capture a lot of islands!"</p>
<p>Of course, if you are sailing in the northern seas in winter, it is indeed cool, and you are exposed to fierce cold. But to say "It must be cool!" about sailing with a warship in the southwestern ocean near the equator is simply not true.</p>
<p>"After a day off, I want to drink some unheated sake."</p>
<p>Someone lamented like this.</p>
<p>The sake on ships sailing in the South Sea is completely heated by the scorching heat. Of course, so is the drinking water.</p>
<p>In this place, the heat is no small matter.</p>
<p>During the summer in Tokyo, when we are cooling off in the evening, we often say, "It's so hot, I won't be able to sleep tonight..."</p>
<p>However, the heat of a Tokyo night, though unpleasant, is still bearable. It is completely incomparable to the heat on a warship sailing under the equator.</p>
<p>The iron plates on the ship are directly exposed to the sun and become almost scalding. The heat they absorb is gradually released at night.</p>
<p>In a room with a fan, hot air swirls around the small space. The hot air blows on you, and you sweat like rain. In this situation, you can no longer say it is cool. Your clothes, starting with your undershirt, are completely soaked.</p>
<p>Despite this, you don't want to change. When you have a fever, you drink something to sweat it out and sit on a cushion to sweat. I can't help but think that the sweating is similar to this. If you were to change clothes, you would probably need hundreds of sets! And first of all, because there is a water shortage, you are restricted, and you cannot do that much laundry on the ship.</p>
<p>We also cannot be naked on the ship. Why? Because we are at war. We never know when we might encounter the enemy and have to start fighting. During war, a ship's hull can be hit by torpedoes from enemy ships or submarines at any time. In that case, no one can afford to be caught flying out naked.</p>
<p>Exposed to this oppressive heat, the image of boiling an egg comes to mind. If there were a mind inside the egg, it would be just like the state of a warship sailing under the equator during "battle stations." That is exactly our state of mind.</p>
<p>Looking at it that way, I can't help but have many unfounded associations. Aren't we just like half-boiled eggs?...</p>
<p>When half-boiled, your head droops, you doze off, and you can't lift your head. We endure this suffering in the room, which is truly indescribable.</p>
<p>The passageway is pitch black. The heat from the engine room fills the ship. Because of the location, it is stuffy and you can't see anything.</p>
<p>Now, when going to the toilet, you have to carry a cane, just like an old woman, groping in the darkness with one hand, cautiously taking one step at a time. Sometimes sailors come from the opposite direction, bumping into you as they walk.</p>
<p>"Be careful of the path ahead, don't panic."</p>
<p>When first boarding the ship, you must be aware of this situation, so you study it carefully in your spare time. Although you think you have become familiar with the passageway and won't bump into anyone, you still scrape your skin on the iron threshold at the entrance of the room, or you lose your footing halfway up the ladder, thinking it is already flat ground. This happens often and is not surprising.</p>
<p>In the officers' quarters of a certain type of destroyer, because of the extreme heat, a square hole large enough for one person to pass through was opened in the entrance to the first deck, but it was still unbearably hot inside.</p>
<p>In that officers' quarters, when eating in such extreme heat, your own sweat would fall into your rice bowl.</p>
<p>I use my own sweat as salt to eat rice. Human eyebrows are truly necessary. If we didn't have eyebrows, the sweat on our foreheads would drip into our eyes, and eating a meal would truly blind us. Eyebrows are not only for beauty; they are a necessary distinction between humans and dogs, and are necessary to prevent sweat, just like snow fences along a railroad. I truly marvel at the wonders of creation.</p>
<p>Deck</p>
<p>In the extreme heat, when I ran out onto the deck, the ship's lights were completely extinguished, and it was advancing through the darkness, cleaving the waves.</p>
<p>"Resurrected!" This phrase is quite fitting to say at this moment.</p>
<p>It is truly a realistic escape from the brink of death, so it is truly unspeakable.</p>
<p>Being on a ship and chased by enemy flying fortresses for eight hours, it was only after the enemy planes left that I ran out of the ship's cabin onto the deck, and the wind from the Ceram Sea bathed my whole body. At this moment, it was truly "Resurrected!" Isn't that amazing?</p>
<p>Looking up, the Big Dipper was on the right, and the Southern Cross was on the left, shining beautifully.</p>
<p>Under that magnificent starry sky, the ship sailed straight towards western Yunnan. I gazed at the horizon ahead. There, I saw no ship shadows, no shadows of small islands. However, in my mind, the image of the fleet that first fought in the Indian Ocean already floated up, watching vigilantly, waiting for an opportunity, and the new planes and pilots of the air force at the forward base advancing side by side. Through the narrow deck, I saw shadows under the starlight, and I saw the medical officer and the purser sitting in chairs, unable to sleep due to the heat, enjoying the cool of the night.</p>
<p>The captain and vice-captain stood on the bridge, anxiously watching the front. Since the warship left port, the captain had been moving between the bridge and the rest of the ship, eating meals on the bridge, while staring at the bow and the stern.</p>
<p>In the officers' quarters, the purser, who had been promoted to lieutenant two or three days prior, was being celebrated. Of course, until the destination was reached and the objective completed, the celebration could only be perfunctory. I, along with that unit, saw some things that I am not allowed to freely and fully describe. The people who accompanied me as naval reporters will either report to you the situation of the landing ahead, or describe the details of each battle, or write down the notes of submarines, so I do not want to write such a news report again. I hope you will understand that before I report "important events" to you, I have first written this fragmented article.</p>
<p>That said, I sat down on the purser's empty chair, temporarily escaping the "boiled egg" state of mind. I turned my gaze to look from the shimmering, phosphorescent sea surface to the distant horizon. Of course, my gaze was endless. Eyes that have undergone training are watching the sea. The vigilance against planes and submarines is truly a work of endurance.</p>
<p>"Being torpedoed in a certain area was really terrible!"</p>
<p>Breaking the silence, the purser began to talk about the story of the submarine.</p>
<p>"One torpedo was aimed at the stern, but we dodged it. Another was aimed at the center of the ship, but it sank before it reached us..."</p>
<p>"The torpedo's wake was as clear as could be..."</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the young navigator interjected, then politely walked off to the bridge, his footsteps tapping away.</p>
<p>"But on a submarine, the heat is truly unbearable... First of all, you can't even bring a chair out onto the deck to cool off..."</p>
<p>The medical officer muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Compared to this ship, the submarine is truly scorching. The area of operation for those friendly submarines extends from the distant Indian Ocean to the American coast.</p>
<p>While wiping the sweat from my forearm, I looked at the conning tower and deck slightly exposed above the waves, and thought of the brave posture of that submarine in a certain area.</p>
<p>Is there any place hotter than this? When I went to the sleeping quarters to rest, I thought again of the "boiled egg state of mind." In that extreme heat, people were operating on the sea even further away than this ship, engaged in a great battle....</p>
<p>Flight</p>
<p>I was wearing three layers of military uniform. When I saw the plane I was about to board, the engine was already roaring. Even though I was wearing a short-sleeved, short-trousered anti-exposure suit, in this hot tropical base, I had tied my necktie properly and put on three sets of military uniform. Sweat dripped down, and my undershirt was completely soaked. However, if you fly to an altitude of 3,000 meters, it is unbearably cold, so there are hardships involved in both flying and sailing on a ship.</p>
<p>When I first flew out of the base and looked down at the vast forest area, when crossing the Vietnamese border, I suddenly felt cold, just like when you have a fever. I could barely breathe if I moved slightly. Looking at the altimeter, the needle was pointing near 5,000 meters.</p>
<p>"If you are not a regular passenger, you will of course feel discomfort after crossing 4,000 meters."</p>
<p>Medical Officer U said this, then added:</p>
<p>"Those who feel discomfort at 3,000 meters can be considered unhealthy, while ordinary people generally feel uncomfortable after passing 4,000 meters."</p>
<p>In the air raid on Darwin, Mr. S wanted to take pictures, but accidentally took the oxygen tube out of his mouth, and immediately vomited because of the bad smell. Without rigorous training, it is of course impossible to operate during a high-altitude air raid. Let's look at the young and excellent fighter pilots. The 22-year-old Petty Officer Second Class K, who brought down multiple enemy planes, was on the Burma front at that time. Under the spirit of fierce attack, he resolutely flew low over the airfield and fired, setting one plane on fire. He then fired at another plane hiding in the coconut grove, also setting it on fire. When turning around to fly back, the enemy barbed wire on the ground caught the left wingtip, but he was still able to fly with a part of the barbed wire tangled on the wing. Such a daring, ultra-low-altitude flight, with the ability to safely return even after being caught on an obstacle, is by no means due to "luck" or "miracles" alone.</p>
<p>"When progressing from basic training to advanced training aircraft, your eyesight sometimes changes. Furthermore, when progressing from advanced training aircraft to 〇〇 fighter planes, your eyesight changes again after combat training. This time, when riding the 〇〇 fighter plane, it was completely different... but you become more courageous. Even driving the 〇〇 fighter plane to its limit is quite common."</p>
<p>The world-class battles engaged in by the crews of large long-range bomber squadrons, large fighter squadrons, and large reconnaissance and patrol squadrons are by no means achieved overnight. Step by step, they have reached such greatness through physical and mental training stages. —We think this way.</p>
<p>All training is not something that can be achieved in one go. Petty Officer Second Class K jumped from basic training aircraft to riding the 〇〇 fighter plane and began fighting. Before the battle, the crew members often have concerns about harming themselves, which is obvious.</p>
<p>This situation is not only about airplanes; there is also the same situation in social training. First of all, this situation demonstrates that anything must be learned through constant training. At the same time, it also reveals the dangers involved in "overdoing it."</p>
<p>On the Plane</p>
<p>I quietly sat next to the telegraph operator, my gaze peacefully fixed on the young backs of the pilots who were firmly grasping the controls. Looking out the window, the preceding squadron was clearly floating.</p>
<p>Nearby, in this squadron, including the fighter planes, the individual facial expressions of the crew members were all clearly visible.</p>
<p>Beyond the hazy horizon, on the boundless ocean, an enemy fleet was advancing, attempting to attack our homeland.</p>
<p>While suppressing the intense emotions burning in my chest, I stared intently to see where the several fleets were lurking in this vast ocean. Closing my eyes, my mind could visualize the strength of that enemy fleet—but reopening my eyes, all my eyes could see was the boundless sky and the endless ocean. Yet, in this vast sky and ocean, it is possible to discover the enemy fleet, which is only as big as a tiny speck. Aren't the "eyes" of our navy divine?</p>
<p>I hugged myself in the cold of the high altitude, watching the various measuring instruments and gauges, and working as a navigator. Here, I also saw those same eyes. When I looked at the people on that small ship who were "watching" for a speck in the vast ocean, I saw that same amazement again. This may be divine power. I felt that this was an organic combination of an organization.</p>
<p>The telegraph operator silently brought over the hot meal: "Won't you eat something?"</p>
<p>I accepted it and also gave him candy.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but think of the young soldiers of the paratrooper unit.</p>
<p>The plane I was riding in was one of the planes that dropped the personnel of the first naval paratrooper unit in the history of the Surabaya Sea Battle over the Siliwangi region. That unit was also the unit that landed on Timor Island for the second time in this plane.</p>
<p>Lovely young men!—I always have this affectionate feeling towards the young men of all units. Especially the young soldiers of the paratrooper unit, who are truly cheerful, are the most "top-notch" men I feel. The ship I first took out from the 〇〇 base was filled with countless "healthy children," sturdy soldiers like specimens, which was them.</p>
<p>At first, I didn't know what kind of unit that unit was. From their equipment, from their training on the ship, I felt strange everywhere. Before long, I realized, "Oh! That's it..."</p>
<p>These kind young soldiers often came to my cabin to play, smiling and handing me candy:</p>
<p>"Sir! Won't you eat some?"</p>
<p>They didn't know how to address me—those only in their twenties eventually called me "Sir."</p>
<p>I really enjoyed talking to them.</p>
<p>"Regarding our own deployment and training, we never said a word before. That was truly the hardest thing. ...If we were blamed for our lack of skill, we wouldn't say anything. We completely escaped from death, and now we can safely parachute down. Just wait and see!"...</p>
<p>Raising their eyebrows proudly, they spoke with relish. How sincere they are!</p>
<p>The first time I was bombed by enemy flying fortresses, I was on the same ship as these soldiers. At that time, the strongest feeling in my mind was, "This unit will not be killed here."</p>
<p>I don't think of myself as great, and I don't want to embellish my feelings. It was entirely because of this "life" that I personally experienced this fearless emotion. But when I thought that some of them had already died for their country on the Southern Front, I couldn't help but beat my chest and think silently.</p>
<p>Because of the telegraph operator's kindness in bringing me a hot meal, I thought of the soldiers of the paratrooper unit who were about the same age as the telegraph operator.</p>
<p>Clouds</p>
<p>—The sun has already climbed over our heads and is setting in the west.</p>
<p>Since this morning, the two engines that have been spinning back and forth in the air have not rested at all. On the instrument panel, the speedometer reads 〇〇〇, and the altimeter reads 4,300 meters. Looking at the engine and the silver-basin-like rotating propeller, in front of us are beautiful, ever-changing clouds, and from the gaps in the clouds, we can see the mysterious jewel colors of the large reefs in the ocean. Under our feet appeared strange rainbows, drawing two arcs. —On the white clouds, the shadow of our plane was imprinted in individual circles. In that round, wreath-like shadow... We have already enjoyed several times the magnificent scenery of nature that ancient people did not even know in their dreams.</p>
<p>The magnificent beauty of nature made me forget the position on the battlefield, the pain of being short of breath, and the shivering cold. Several times, a feeling of happiness like ascending to heaven after becoming a celestial being flew through my chest.</p>
<p>But nature not only welcomes us with that kind of beautiful or magnificent posture, but also all kinds of beautiful phenomena in the air, which at any time become obstacles to the operation of the air force.</p>
<p>The light of the setting sun on all sides passed through the sea in a straight line, shining on the eastern sky, and strangely shaped dense clouds cut off the front.</p>
<p>The first squadron lowered its altitude as if it were sinking. Seen from high altitude, it looked like a small boat floating on the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>When we spread out the aviation chart, we knew that we were approaching our destination. And in front of us, there was nothing to be seen, only layers of cloud mountains blocking our way.</p>
<p>Our squadron also lowered its altitude. The nail of the altimeter read three thousand, two thousand, one thousand... We felt quite hot inside the plane.</p>
<p>We saw a burst of heavy rain. The lead-colored clouds had already cut off the sunlight behind us. The sea ahead, which had previously been a single expanse of water and sky, was now filled with layers of white, suffocating clouds.</p>
<p>Don't rush past it—I thought.</p>
<p>Although this cloud had no oxygen, I had never seen a cloud so low. I remembered a time when I had rushed into such a cloud.</p>
<p>—In the "white fog" where you could only make out the things at the wingtips, the sound of the heavy rain covered the engine's roar. The sun was not visible, nor was the ground.</p>
<p>The ever-changing posture of the clouds seen in the clear sky, the magnificence of the rainbow! However, seeing those clouds, that rainbow, and even suddenly breaking into this heavy rain, was only a moment, and the place where we were about to land was blocked. It suddenly turned into a 〇〇 world that played with our emotions and made us tremble.</p>
<p>Before one burst of heavy rain had passed, another burst of heavy rain followed closely behind. The squadron was eager to avoid the dark clouds ahead, tilted its wings, and changed direction.</p>
<p>We could only see a small black shadow of a friendly plane in our squadron. We began to fly high again. The sun began to shine on the wings of the planes from the western horizon again.</p>
<p>Indeed, under those thick clouds, there was a small island, our destination. But our eyes could not see it.</p>
<p>If this were a single plane, it might have rushed into the heavy rain, floated on the sea, and reached its destination, but we were a formed squadron, and the commander's plane seemed to intend not to take the above-mentioned risk unless there was a problem with the fuel.</p>
<p>The squadron was circling, looking for a large gap in the clouds. The navigator began to be surprisingly active, recording the constantly changing position of the plane on the map.</p>
<p>There was no gap in the clouds at all. —Should we fly above the clouds?</p>
<p>If we flew past the destination, which was only a small dot in the ocean, then there would be another vast and boundless sea ahead. The sun was about to set. In another thirty minutes, the light of day would disappear from the sky. The sea was already showing a black color. If the night curtain were to come down... that would mean great difficulty.</p>
<p>If we didn't see the island under these clouds in the next thirty minutes, we would be in considerable danger. I have never felt anything as fast as the Earth's rotation. "Falling sharply," the sun in the sky would "fall sharply" to the horizon like this in thirty minutes.</p>
<p>The navigator looked at me and smiled, tying the knot of the life rope.</p>
<p>I haven't felt a real crisis yet. I didn't say a word. I didn't even look back at our friendly planes. Perhaps it was because I felt at ease after seeing the back of the young pilot holding the control stick?</p>
<p>One Battle</p>
<p>Suddenly, we saw a valley between clouds and clouds in front of us, and the first squadron was like a small sparrow, flying through the active valley. —These clouds might merge and close this valley at any time. But, from this valley, our eyes saw a dark shadow far away on the lead-colored sea.</p>
<p>We flew to that island, and after everyone landed safely, the sky and this isolated island were once again heavily sealed by rain.</p>
<p>"If it had been thirty minutes later..."</p>
<p>That night, after everyone met, they all said the same thing. But as for myself, this cannot yet be said to have been a real crisis. Before this, you received a wireless order on the Pacific Ocean: "Search for the missing plane within a 2,000-meter distance," and you flew towards your destination for three hours. At that time, I really felt hurried in my chest. A certain plane had an engine failure on the side and sent the message, "I may also be one of the missing," and then the message was cut off.</p>
<p>So this flight didn't feel as rushed as the last time. But the feelings I felt in my heart were unexpectedly strong. Can't that be said to be the feeling of comradeship in arms?</p>
<p>This boundless sea, with a missing plane as small as a mustard seed, stirred up various imaginations and stimulated the heart with a feeling of despair. What if I saw... it would never be a plane from the ship. What if I saw the shadows of people on board that I thought were from the missing plane? Would I open my eyes to look at him?</p>
<p>The driver, crew member, navigator, and telegraph operator anxiously opened eight eyes. Staring at the four seas, the sound of the engine dominated time and space. We could not help but encounter human life associated with the life of this engine. The greatness before this nature is more difficult than fighting the enemy. This is another battle posture before battle, fighting with "distance."</p>
<p>Thinking of the Motherland</p>
<p>The homeland was bombed!</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, we felt that the distant homeland had also become the front. When receiving that report, everyone felt that since the founding of the country, no matter how many wars have been fought, no matter how many people were involved, they had never experienced the situation in this war.</p>
<p>That night, a pale blue crescent moon hung in the southern sky, and a rare cool wind blew from the east. While gazing at that crescent moon, we talked about the homeland with the officers. If the enemy dares to come now, they can be wiped out in one fell swoop!</p>
<p>The focus of our discussion was what impact this air raid would have on the rear.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of guerilla air raid will not cause any damage to the Japanese army's major operations or great victories.</p>
<p>However, thinking that this is a national all-out war and that the civilians in the rear are also deployed in their respective battle positions, the impact that this air raid has on the civilians can also be considered a very significant one.</p>
<p>"Is the motherland safe?"—Everyone was thinking deeply about this matter. We trust the army to respond calmly and stubbornly. For example, the panic of people who don't understand war and the general public is just making a fuss. Panicking won't defeat the enemy. We only know that we must trust the army and resist stubbornly.</p>
<p>Look! The great achievements of the Battle of the Coral Sea. We were already sure of what the enemy would do after being defeated by our navy. At the same time, the enemy is also planning. Why? The enemy, who wanted to attack the homeland, was probably discovered by us and annihilated in one fell swoop. Therefore, are they not just using a small number of large aircraft to quickly advance and retreat from outside the radius of action of our naval aircraft? This is indeed the American way. Those of you who witnessed this air raid can probably confirm this!</p>
<p>This time, they did not expect the North American B25 to return to the ship. This so-called one-way air raid spirit is very different from the spirit of our navy's attack on Pearl Harbor. You can probably understand this. This is by no means a spirit of desperate annihilation. The spirit of those crew members is certainly incomparable to the spirit of sacrifice of the Pearl Harbor Special Attack Force. They thought that if they left the mother ship, passed over Japan, and arrived in mainland China, their lives would be safe. This is the same gambling spirit as the "warriors" of the American air force in the previous war.</p>
<p>But we must be very wary of their "gambling spirit." They know how generous our group is to prisoners. It is dangerous if they use our generosity to come here. Unlike us, they don't think it is dishonorable to be taken prisoner. Won't they come from even further away than this time with bombs from the summer silkworms, complete their mission, raise both hands, and come down by parachute to surrender?</p>
<p>We must not forget that they are still arrogantly boasting and looking down on us. This time, they brought small, malicious incendiary bombs to make a mess. On the other hand, they also consider Japanese cities to be "small," and we must keep in mind that they have the idea of using those incendiary bombs to burn down our cities. Their conversations never fail to mention war, and we must be wary of their spirit.</p>
<p>On the Southern Front, the first words of an American aviator who was shot down and captured after parachuting down were: "No matter what, please give me a glass of whiskey first." (Translator's note)</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Full Story of the Naval and Air Battle of Bougainville Island <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhichao</p>
<p>The great naval and air battle of Bougainville Island, which began in late October, lasted for more than a month until the beginning of December. During this time, the Japanese Navy sank four American battleships, seven aircraft carriers, twelve cruisers, and eleven destroyers, creating the greatest victory since the Pearl Harbor attack. The news of this shook the world. The circumstances of this battle are described below:</p>
<p>Bougainville Island is the largest island in the Solomon Islands and a shield for Rabaul (on New Britain Island), the Japanese southern front naval base. It is located east of New Guinea, west of the British Ellice Islands and the New Hebrides, and north of Australia. These areas are mostly in enemy hands. In terms of location, it is surrounded on three sides by enemy forces and is quite isolated. However, the Japanese army has occupied this location. Since occupying this location, they have made great efforts to consolidate its defensive strength, making it a strong fortress on the southern front, not only threatening Australia but also using it as a base to hinder American transportation and resupply to Australia. Therefore, it is not surprising that the American army is determined to obtain it at any cost, regardless of any tragic sacrifices.</p>
<p>In the southern part of Bougainville Island, the Torokina River flows out to the sea, and the mouth of the river is called Torokina Point. At the river mouth is a steep and majestic island, which is the location the Americans have captured this time. Sixty kilometers south of Bougainville Island is a barren island called Mono, which can be said to be a satellite of Bougainville Island to the south. The American army occupied it during the initial attack. The so-called "Bougainville Island Naval and Air Battle" unfolded on the sea near these two locations.</p>
<p>Before this war began, the American army naturally made sufficient preparations. Over the past two years, the United States has claimed to have built twelve aircraft carriers, totaling 500,000 tons. At the same time, according to news from Berlin, since the Italian navy was lost in the Mediterranean, the British and Americans transferred their navy in that area, including four to five battleships, three to four aircraft carriers, seven to eight heavy cruisers, and more than ten destroyers, to the East to deal with Japan. Therefore, the situation of the Japanese navy in the South Seas before the Battle of Bougainville Island was not very strong in terms of numbers.</p>
<p>Preliminary Battles</p>
<p>The American air raid on Bougainville Island on October 20 can be said to be the prelude to the naval and air battle of Bougainville Island. The attacking American planes numbered only twenty, and as a result, thirteen were shot down. It is clear that this surprise attack was weak and only intended to scout the strength of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Starting on October 22, the American side officially challenged the Japanese garrison on Bougainville Island. In total, from the 22nd to the 25th, over four days, the American side sent 652 planes to bomb Buin, the southernmost tip of Bougainville Island. On the 26th, they dispatched 360 planes in a single sortie for a large-scale bombing.</p>
<p>This surprise attack was actually intended to contain the Japanese forces on Bougainville Island to cover their attempt to land troops on Mono Island. The next morning, it was discovered that American troops had landed on Mono Island.</p>
<p>Mono Island is twelve kilometers long from east to west and eight kilometers wide from north to south. It is a barren island with no inhabitants. After the American army occupied it, Buin, the fortress on the southern tip of Bougainville Island, was greatly threatened. From the morning of the 27th, the Japanese side dispatched naval aircraft to launch a large-scale bombing of the American ships near the landing site, resulting in the sinking of one small transport ship, two cruisers, and one large transport ship. A torpedo sank one small transport ship, and one large cruiser and one small transport ship were damaged. The attacking Japanese aircraft also suffered minor losses.</p>
<p>After the American army established a forward base on Mono Island, they began a large-scale operation at the end of October. Several large transport ships, protected by giant warships, moved towards Bougainville Island from the southeast. No matter how concealed, this kind of large-scale operation could not escape the reconnaissance of Japanese patrol planes. The American attack had three targets: the first was Buka Island, opposite the northern end of Bougainville Island; the second was Torokina Point, in the waist of Bougainville Island; and the third was Stirling Island, between Mono Island and Buin. Armed ships from the south advanced along three routes, with the Torokina Point route being the most important, so the fighting on this route was particularly fierce.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Japanese side launched a full-scale counterattack from late night on October 31. East of Mono Island and west of Bougainville Island, large numbers of bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters were dispatched for a desperate attack. At the same time, the Japanese fleet stationed in Rabaul Harbor also set sail south, encountering the American fleet on the sea off Torokina Point. This great battle lasted until the morning of November 2nd. The battle results announced by the Japanese side are as follows:</p>
<p>Naval Air Force Battle Results</p>
<p>Sunk: Two large transport ships</p>
<p>Sunk: One cruiser, one destroyer, over 40 landing craft</p>
<p>Shot down: 10 American planes</p>
<p>Damaged: One large cruiser, one cruiser or destroyer, two large transport ships, many small vessels</p>
<p>Fleet Battle Results</p>
<p>Sunk: One large cruiser, two large destroyers</p>
<p>Sunk: Two large cruisers, one cruiser or large destroyer</p>
<p>Damaged: One to two large cruisers, two destroyers</p>
<p>The Japanese side also lost one destroyer and some aircraft. Another cruiser was damaged.</p>
<p>At the same time as the naval and air battle, the American army landed at Torokina Point on November 1st, and on the 2nd, they landed at Hall Sound to the north. The small island in front of Torokina Point was naturally occupied. The American losses were so severe that even the United States itself did not deny it. It is said that the Japanese army defending the area, facing a superior enemy, killed 1,800 American soldiers in a single bayonet charge.</p>
<p>First Battle</p>
<p>After the naval and air battle on November 1st, the American side desperately reinforced the landing troops and sent out over two hundred (November 2nd) planes to attack the Japanese naval base at Rabaul. Another 135 planes attacked Buka Island. The Japanese side met the challenge and used excellent naval aircraft to confront them. In the Rabaul area, the Japanese land-based anti-aircraft artillery, warships, and aircraft together shot down as many as 201 planes. Very few American planes survived. This can be said to be unprecedented in the history of air combat. In the Buka area, 39 planes were also shot down.</p>
<p>Then came the "First Bougainville Island Air Battle" on November 5th. Learning from the lessons of previous defeats, the American side adopted the so-called "aircraft carrier group" tactics. This time, the fleet centered around two aircraft carriers, each with various warships arranged in two circular formations, with very strict defenses. In addition, aircraft from land bases also flew in to assist, boldly attempting to break through the power of the Japanese air force and seize air supremacy in the Bougainville Island war in one fell swoop. However, this was exactly what the Japanese side had been hoping for. On the evening of the 5th, when the American aircraft carrier group sailed to the sea south of Bougainville Island, Japanese planes suddenly appeared. The results of the attack:</p>
<p>Sunk: One large aircraft carrier</p>
<p>Sunk: One medium-sized aircraft carrier, two large cruisers, two cruisers or destroyers</p>
<p>After November 6th, the land battles continued, and New Britain Island was frequently attacked by American planes. The Japanese army's air force also performed remarkably. From the 6th to the 9th, Japanese planes bombed [gap] New Guinea six times. [gap] shot down a total of 120 [gap] American planes, and also shot down 59 American planes.</p>
<p>Second Battle</p>
<p>On the morning of November 8th, the Japanese [gap] reported that the American [gap] was concentrated at Torokina Point. Large numbers of [gap] fighters and bombers departed in batches. When they discovered that the American [gap] was concentrated in such large numbers [gap] in one place, the Japanese [gap] pilots were excited. In the first wave of Japanese attacks, only five minutes [gap] American [gap] three ships, [gap] four [gap] immediately [gap] thoroughly, and two cruisers and one transport ship were damaged. During the attack, American [gap] fighters flew in to attack, but 15 were shot down. The Japanese fighter [gap] commander, Captain Nōfu, unfortunately [gap] died in this battle.</p>
<p>Originally, the Japanese navy's tactics were different from other countries. The flagship carrying the commander was sure to be the first to break into the enemy formation at the point of engagement. The naval air force's style was also like this.</p>
<p>Captain Nōfu's position was naturally the most vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>At this time, [gap] the weather gradually worsened. Subsequent Japanese planes departed from the base in flashes of lightning. Batch after batch of suicide squads advanced in the chaos. By the time they reached their destination, it was already evening. The sun set at 4:30 PM in both oceans. By chance, Japanese planes in the [gap] discovered the main force of the fleet in the [gap] retreating at full speed. As soon as the [gap] fired, they braved a barrage of anti-aircraft fire and charged straight down, right up to the American [gap] before launching torpedoes. In an instant, the calm sea erupted with columns of water. Flames roared, and one American battleship caught fire. Two cruisers immediately sank into the sea, and another cruiser and three destroyers caught fire. At this time, the third wave of torpedo planes arrived. After an attack, one of the four burning battleships sank into the sea, and Captain Nosaka, who led the torpedo squadron, also died in battle, following in the footsteps of his predecessors. In total, the Japanese side lost 20 planes in this battle, and besides the two captains, three squadron leaders also died. Conversely, the price obtained was very high, which shows how fierce this battle was.</p>
<p>Sunk: 4 battleships, 3 destroyers, 4 transport ships, 2 cruisers</p>
<p>Damaged: 6 large cruisers severely damaged, 4 cruisers or destroyers severely damaged, 1 large transport ship, 15 aircraft shot down</p>
<p>Third Battle</p>
<p>In order to cover up their defeats, the Americans had to seek revenge again and again. At the same time, the [gap] landing troops also needed [gap] continuous replenishment and resupply, making it impossible for the tiger to stop. On the Japanese side, they considered it a golden opportunity to use relatively less valuable air power to attack high-value fleets, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>On November 11th, the tragedy of mutual bombing occurred. That morning, American aircraft carriers coordinated with land-based air forces to launch over 200 planes in a single sortie to bomb the Japanese naval and air base at Rabaul. The Japanese air force, however, chose to attack the American mobile fleet, focusing on the more valuable targets. In Rabaul, the Japanese sank one destroyer, lightly damaged one cruiser, and lightly damaged one cruiser, losing 10 planes in exchange for 71 American planes. On the other hand, the American fleet west of Mono Island encountered unprecedented bad luck.</p>
<p>The American fleet was divided into two parts. The part centered on aircraft carriers was discovered at noon on the 11th. After a fierce attack by Japanese planes, a cruiser or destroyer was sunk, and two large aircraft carriers were hit by several bombs. Several other cruisers or destroyers caught fire. In the evening, another fleet centered on battleships was discovered sailing north in the sea west of Mono Island. Although the weather [gap] was bad, making it difficult to attack, Japanese planes still inflicted moderate damage on one battleship and severe fire damage on one large cruiser. The Japanese planes also lost 30 aircraft. The results of the battle are as follows:</p>
<p>Sunk: 1 cruiser</p>
<p>Moderately Damaged: 1 battleship</p>
<p>Lightly Damaged: 2 large aircraft carriers</p>
<p>Severely Damaged and on Fire: 1 large cruiser, 3 cruisers or large destroyers, 1 destroyer</p>
<p>Fourth Battle</p>
<p>The Japanese naval planes [gap] were exhausted [gap] and were constantly [gap] returning to base. Sure enough, at 3:00 AM on November 13th, the American fleet [gap] was discovered taking advantage of the darkness of the 12th, centered on [gap] battleships, [gap] and a force consisting of heavy cruisers, light cruisers, and destroyers [gap] was advancing from the east towards the Japanese base at Rabaul and had already reached [gap] the [gap] waters off Mono Island.</p>
<p>The Japanese planes [gap] immediately targeted battleships and aircraft carriers, launching a fierce [gap] attack with torpedo planes. Before long, [gap] one battleship was severely damaged. Smoke billowed from the stern, and a fire broke out. The speed was greatly reduced, and it was almost dying. At the same time, a major fire broke out on the aircraft carrier, and it was almost sinking. Although the Japanese side did not [gap] include it in the list of sunken [gap], it was estimated that it was very likely to sink. On the right, one large and one small cruiser were sunk, and one destroyer was hit by a torpedo. However, two Japanese planes also made [gap] a costly sacrifice.</p>
<p>A special feature of this air battle was that naval aircraft carried out the most difficult night attacks and torpedo warfare. It was really difficult to [gap] attack the enemy at night. Relying only on the faint trail left by the passing fleet on the sea, finding and tracking these trails required flying the plane so low that it almost touched the surface of the sea. One careless move would mean joining the sea creatures. As for the attack, it required skills of a divine nature. This skill was the result of years of training by the Japanese naval air force. The results of the fourth air battle are as follows:</p>
<p>Sunk: 1 large cruiser</p>
<p>Sunk: 1 cruiser</p>
<p>Sunk: 1 destroyer</p>
<p>Severely Damaged: 1 battleship, 1 medium-sized aircraft carrier</p>
<p>Fifth Battle</p>
<p>The nature of the Fifth Bougainville Island Naval Air Battle was the same as the first battle, but the results were even greater. Only the South Pacific Naval Battle on October 26 of last year, in which Japan sank three American [gap] aircraft carriers in one fell swoop, can be compared. The American's stubborn tactics of not [gap] fearing sacrifices were seen as foolish by the Japanese, who were accustomed to exchanging the least sacrifices for the greatest gains. This was probably because the United States had too abundant resources.</p>
<p>Before dawn on the 17th, a powerful American fleet, based on three aircraft carriers and accompanied by cruisers and other ships, was discovered again several tens of nautical miles south of Bougainville Island. The Japanese "sea [gap]" once again demonstrated their "capture" tactics and established remarkable results:</p>
<p>Large [gap] aircraft carrier: 1</p>
<p>Medium [gap] aircraft carriers: 2</p>
<p>Cruisers: 3</p>
<p>Large [gap] warship (type [gap] unknown): 1</p>
<p>At the same time as the above [gap] attack, Japan [gap] also sent out fighter squadrons and bomber squadrons to attack the American landing [gap] fleet at Torokina Point. [Gap] There were thirty fighters [gap] protecting the fleet's sky. When the Japanese fighters attacked, the [gap] torpedo [gap] bombers [gap] swarmed up, [gap] [gap], but after returning with achievements, they were unfortunately pursued by about a hundred American fighters, resulting in the loss of ten planes. The results of this battle were:</p>
<p>Sunk: 3 small to medium-sized transport ships</p>
<p>Damaged: 1 small transport ship</p>
<p>On Fire: 1 destroyer</p>
<p>At that time, Japan [gap] [gap] [gap] sixth [gap] [gap] the great battle [gap] [gap] said in December [gap] [gap] south, [gap] [gap] navigation [gap] ships 2, battleship or large [gap] ship 1, large cruiser [gap], sunk aircraft carrier 1, in addition [gap] one on fire severely damaged, large [gap] [gap] and [gap] [gap] one severely damaged.</p>
<p>A Calculation</p>
<p>Not yet finished, the Japanese navy's traditional [gap] [gap] the spirit of overcoming the enemy [gap] is competing with America's bean-sized production capacity [gap] [gap]. Both [gap] will become popular in the future [gap] remarkable military exploits, it seems that [gap] it has been decided that the Japanese [gap] are waiting, we estimate the known results, make a battle statistics, [gap] in order to estimate what kind of heavy losses the United States has suffered, how much strength is still left, it is not without meaning.</p>
<p>In total, 93 warships were lost and damaged on both sides, not including small boats. 576 American planes were shot down, and 16 were damaged. In addition, one destroyer caught fire due to a misunderstanding. Except for two Japanese cruisers and two destroyers sunk, and two cruisers damaged, only a few planes were sacrificed.</p>
<p>Looking at it from another angle, since the battle near Mono Island at the end of October, how many trained sailors has the United States lost, and how many warships have been built [gap] [gap] the bottom of the sea [gap] [gap]. According to the calculations of Japanese intelligence officer Iguchi, based on the above table:</p>
<p>(Note) Only sinking and destroying are counted, repair costs for damage are not included.</p>
<p>From the end of October to the beginning of December, in just over a month, in a corner of the vast South Sea, in an area of hundreds of miles, more than 20,000 American soldiers silently and silently rest forever on the seabed. Giant ships costing nearly 700 million [currency] or more sank to become scrap iron on the seabed. The ferocity of the battle and the bravery of the Japanese army can be imagined.</p>
<p>Explanation of the Bougainville Island Terrain Map</p>
<p>Bougainville Island, which has become famous due to this battle, is one of the islands at the northwestern end of the Solomon Islands. It was discovered in 1768 by the Frenchman Bougainville during his circumnavigation of the world. The island has an area of 10,000 square kilometers and is the largest of the Solomon Islands. Except for the capital, [gap] Roki Cape, in the east [gap], it is a humid swamp. The 30,000 inhabitants are divided into Melanesians and Papuan mountain [gap] tribes living in remote areas of the island.</p>

<h3 id="e65">After the Pearl Harbor Air Raid <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Time flies, and today, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, marks the third December 8th. On this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I cannot help but recall the fierce battle at Pearl Harbor on the day the war began. Pearl Harbor was the largest naval base for the U.S. in the Pacific. Various reports have been made about the fierce fighting at the time, but this article is a recent record of what was personally witnessed by Japanese residents in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It is specially translated below for our readers. - Translator's Note</p>
<p>It Was a Real Attack</p>
<p>Overhead, a formation of Boeing B17s flew towards Wheeler Airfield. This was the reinforcement force that had been arriving daily from the U.S. mainland since that December 8th (Hawaii time was the 7th). Why was this type of top-secret military movement being carried out in broad daylight? It turns out that around 8 p.m. on the night after the heroic battle, a formation of nineteen Boeing B17s had rushed to reinforce from San Diego. Unexpectedly, they were mistaken by the ground forces at Pearl Harbor as Japanese planes returning to attack, so they fired anti-aircraft guns wildly, almost completely destroying all nineteen American planes. The American airmen on the planes, after receiving the "welcome" of the anti-aircraft guns, thought that Pearl Harbor had already been occupied by the Japanese army. They dropped all the bombs they were carrying, resulting in a rather serious and laughable situation. Since then, air transport has been conducted during the day. My wife and I, under the shade of guava trees, chased the planes along a small path from the Aiea Heights towards Punchbowl Crater, hoping to see the heroic sacrifice of our motherland's warriors at Pearl Harbor. Panting on the steep slope, we looked at the green waves of Pearl Harbor and silently prayed for the victory of our motherland. This was the morning of the third day after the Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor. In order to witness the relics of the bloody battle and to imprint the war achievements in our minds, we disregarded the curfew that prohibited going out from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. and climbed the hills north of Aiea in the early morning to look down and survey the Waikiki coast, the city of Honolulu, and the Pearl Harbor area in all directions.</p>
<p>On the morning of December 8th, I had just finished breakfast when I heard my child shout, "Planes with the Hinomaru flag!" I was puffing on my pipe, watching the blue smoke leisurely rise into the blue sky, which had been cleansed by the wind and rain of the previous night, enjoying myself immensely. At that time, not only myself, but anyone living in Oahu would have answered, "It's a drill!" However, a few minutes later, a distant, rumbling sound came from afar, and it grew louder and louder. At that moment, I suddenly felt a strange sensation, as if a bug was quickly crawling down my spine.</p>
<p>I immediately went to the radio, and with trembling hands, I turned the dial to K·G·U· station, and then to K·G·M·B· station. Immediately, I heard the radio station shouting, "Pearl Harbor is under attack by the Japanese army. It's a real attack!"</p>
<p>"It's a real attack!" Ah, is this not a dream? Ever since I landed in Hawaii, whenever I was oppressed by the American authorities, I would imagine such a scene in my mind. I never thought it would actually come true! I gazed from the veranda at the plumes of black smoke rising up, and saw bean-sized objects diving in formation into the smoke, drawing circles like silk threads in mid-air, presenting a magnificent picture against the backdrop of the blue sky. It was indeed wonderfully beautiful.</p>
<p>I don't know how much time had passed when the radio began calling for doctors and nurses. Hearing this call, I realized the seriousness of the situation. Especially when I heard the call for undertakers, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>The streets were extremely chaotic. I tried to call my friends, but I couldn't get through. In my anxiety, I waited until noon when Mr. K from the Japanese language school came to inquire about the news with several extra editions of newspapers. According to him, in the Honolulu city area, more than a dozen Japanese people had been hit by shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells. Some had died from their injuries, and some, though not killed, had suffered serious wounds. He also told me that the Hickam and Kaneohe airfields had been completely destroyed, and the warships had suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>I spent the day in fear and anxiety. At night, I heard the sound of explosions, and I thought to myself, "Could the Japanese army have landed?" Because there were many rumors at the time, such as Japanese paratroopers landing and submarines infiltrating the naval base, they sounded very believable. I believed them too, until later when I found out that only the news of submarines infiltrating the naval base was true. The next morning, amid the sound of military trucks speeding by, the sky gradually brightened.</p>
<p>Many eyewitnesses were recounting the events of the time to each other. What touched me the most was what Mr. M's servant boy said. He said that he had witnessed a Japanese plane self-destructing in Pacific Heights. The wings were gone, and the fuselage was charred. Inside, several oil-covered airmen were lying there, as if protecting each other. One of the warriors was still tightly clutching his military sword. Saying this, the servant boy said, as if very surprised, "They didn't even have parachutes!" We were deeply moved by the noble spirit of the Japanese soldiers, and we couldn't help but shed tears. Later, we heard that the naval base was still searching for Japanese special submarines, and at the same time, they began to collect the dead from the destroyed American warships.</p>
<p>The next morning (the 10th), my wife and I climbed Aiea Heights. Because the Waiawa Ridge blocked the view, we couldn't see Wheeler Field, but we could still see thin smoke rising from that area. Look! Pearl Harbor! Where has the American Pacific Fleet, which proudly dominated that area four days ago, gone now? It doesn't look like they are leaving the harbor to attack! Look! Isn't that the wreckage of overturned battleships over there? Those moving back and forth are all small boats. At the net barrier! The mouth of the bay, there are several ships that seem to be destroyers, dropping depth charges. Water columns are rising up, and soon, the rumbling sound is heard continuously. Looking elsewhere, it seems as if the world-shaking battle of two days ago had never happened. The scenery is peaceful and unchanged. Just as I was sinking into endless emotion, my wife suddenly sobbed, "Under that water..." Watching Pearl Harbor under the guava trees, we couldn't help but have tears streaming down our faces like a spring. We bowed to the most honorable people of Japan and unconsciously knelt on the ground, putting our palms together. My wife's and my hands, without knowing when, were tightly gripping the leaves, turning our hands green. (Written by M., a construction contractor)</p>
<p>Cheering "Banzai" in a Low Voice by the Radio</p>
<p>It was truly an amazing thing. Since the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor, within about a month, the attitude of the average American towards the Japanese had become extremely intimate. At first, we didn't understand their true intentions and felt a little uneasy. Later, we realized that they were doing this in the hope that we would consider them pro-Japanese elements when the Japanese army landed in Hawaii. On the evening of December 8th, of course, and even for the next two or three days, Honolulu was in complete chaos. At that time, Christmas was already very close. If it were in previous years, the large Christmas tree at the Liberty House department store on Fort Street would have been a sensation, but this year, no one cared about it. Originally, this Christmas tree was specially shipped from the U.S. mainland, being the largest one. In this Hawaii, where there is no winter, it allowed people to experience the feeling of winter, attracting a lot of attention from the local residents. However, at this time, the most anxious thing for the citizens of Honolulu was food. They no longer had the leisure and elegance of the past, and everyone rushed to the food stores. Women were carrying in their hands and under their arms large and small packages of salted meat, ham, canned food, and all kinds of other foods. From the large food companies on Fort Street and King Street to the Weigert food chains, which were almost on every street corner in Honolulu, all were crowded with customers. In just a few hours, the goods in these stores were sold out as if swept away by a whirlwind, but people were still coming in droves, forcing the shopkeepers to close the iron gates, leaving the crowds who had not yet bought food to make a commotion outside.</p>
<p>From the day of the bombing, martial law was declared, and citizens were prohibited from going out from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. The blackout was also enforced extremely strictly. If even the slightest glimmer of light shone out from a covered light inside a house, the patrolmen outside would open fire with their pistols. Countless families experienced this situation, especially when they were going to bed. Moreover, the patrolmen never gave a warning before shooting. Therefore, the general public spent their days trembling in terror.</p>
<p>After a few days, the fear of a Japanese landing gradually subsided, and the oppression of the local Japanese residents gradually intensified. The number of Japanese residents who were designated as the Japanese Fifth Column and detained by the FBI increased daily. The FBI was located in the Dillingham Building, a three-story Spanish-style building. Guards with loaded rifles prevented Japanese people from approaching the lawn in front of it. If you wanted to enter this building, the only way was to be escorted from your home by American soldiers with loaded rifles. For example, Mr. H, who was originally from Hongwanji temple, was one of them. Mr. H was immediately arrested because his servant secretly informed the authorities that he had been eagerly listening to the radio the day before the bombing. He was personally transferred by the FBI to G2 (the U.S. Army's intelligence agency) and the naval intelligence department. He was detained for three weeks before being allowed to return home. At the same time, the American authorities also began to detain influential members of the Japanese community. Sand Island in Honolulu Bay was suddenly crowded with Japanese people, but on the other hand, Honolulu was gradually feeling a shortage of manpower, and the state of panic was increasing. Originally, almost all the local carpenters and agricultural workers were Japanese, and carpenters were needed everywhere to repair the destroyed buildings and expand the fortifications. Therefore, even carpenters with mediocre skills could earn around $300 a month at that time. The prices of vegetables and fruits also increased seven or eight times due to transportation difficulties and other reasons. Furthermore, due to the expansion of the army and navy and the procurement of their supplies, prices rose even higher. In order to accommodate American soldiers, starting from the 9th, Japanese middle schools, elementary schools, and other private Japanese language schools affiliated with the Hongwanji temple system were ordered to suspend classes and evacuate, and the schools were converted into barracks. Fish were also in short supply because Japanese fishermen, who made up the largest number of fishermen on the island, were prohibited from going out to sea to fish, causing great hardship for the lower-class citizens.</p>
<p>In this monotonous life, the only comfort was listening to the good news broadcast from our homeland on the radio. Although Japanese residents were not allowed to use shortwave radios, we still used all sorts of means to secretly listen, or else we would go to the homes of second-generation Japanese-Americans to hear the voices of Japan. Not only Japanese residents were doing this, but also Americans. What was the reason for this? It turned out that they had no place to go for entertainment. Waikiki Beach, known as the world's best swimming beach, was off-limits to the general public. Not only that, but the entire coast of Oahu Island was fenced off with five or six layers of barbed wire. Swimming was out of the question. As for mountain climbing, from the Diamond Head fortress area to the highlands around Nuuanu Pali, where the Kaneohe Naval Air Station could be seen, all were forbidden to enter. As for watching movies, there was only one daytime showing. The large open-air movie theaters in Waikiki, such as the Princess Theatre and the Queen Theatre, squatted in the dark like monsters at night, without a single person. Therefore, they had no choice but to keep the radio as their companion. Because the news broadcast by Japan matched the words of the Americans who witnessed the air raid on Hawaii, the general public was very trusting. It was only natural that both Americans and Japanese, regardless of being enemies or friends, were waiting for the Japanese broadcast.</p>
<p>When we heard the reports of the naval battle off the coast of Malaya and the fall of Singapore, we shed tears of emotion countless times, and at the same time, we shouted "Banzai" in a low voice countless times.

<p>— War Memoirs</p>
<p>When I heard about the great victories in the Gilbert Islands and the news of the American landing on Makin and Tarawa, my blood boiled. I recalled the dawn of August 17th last year when I learned of the landing on Makin Island at the southern base, and I went to bomb with the "Eagle Warriors". From the end of October to the beginning of November two months later, I stayed on those islands for ten days. As a member of the naval press corps, I flew around the islands for a week and saw the strong defense of the sea, land, and air forces united as one. I felt boundless trust. Now, the air force warriors are probably fighting bravely.</p>
<p>The Gilbert Islands Situation</p>
<p>The Gilbert Islands, with Little Makin, 260 miles southeast of the Marshall Islands, as its northernmost point, consist of sixteen islands, including Makin and Tarawa, spread out from north to south. Their position is like a sharp dagger aimed at the enemy's blood transfusion route connecting the U.S. and Australia. They are a militarily important stronghold, but economically, they have no value other than copra. The reason why this archipelago became a British protectorate in 1917 was simply because Britain wanted to suppress the Marshall Islands. Today, it is understandable that the British and Americans are using a large fleet to recapture these islands, considering history.</p>
<p>This may be the enemy's desperate act after suffering successive defeats on Bougainville Island, but in any case, after failing in the landing operation last August, they did not give up and still vainly attempted to recapture the lost territory. Therefore, this area will also become a decisive battlefield.</p>
<p>Tarawa is the seat of the British Gilbert Islands administration, which can be reached in 0 minutes by plane from Makin. The shape of the island resembles a reclining monkey. The part corresponding to the monkey's foot is Betio Island, which has government offices, a post office, a radio station, a central hospital, a church, etc.; to the east is Bairiki Island, which has King George V School; the north shore is a calm inland sea with a large pier protruding into it.</p>
<p>Makin Island is the second most important island after Tarawa in terms of administration. The British have a district officer stationed on the island. This island is long and narrow in the northeast. At the central part of the island, the width is only about 300 meters. Last year's Makin operation was carried out in its eastern part, the battlefield being an area with lush coconut trees.</p>
<p>Same Skin Color</p>
<p>The indigenous people of the two islands total 0,000. They sincerely welcomed the Japanese army's landing, saying in broken English, "You me same skin" (You and I have the same skin color). During the Battle of Makin, the Kia family, who were carpenters, all helped the Japanese army carry bullets and stretchers for the wounded. The other islanders also assisted the Japanese army in the same way, and they bowed and thanked the Japanese army morning and evening. They will work with the Japanese army as brothers and sisters to destroy the American army. The only Japanese resident in the Gilbert Islands, Chojiro Kanzaki (originally from Tateishihara-cho, Fujisawa City), often said, "As long as I see the magnificent appearance of the Imperial Army, I can die at any time." The current victories will make him, who has spent thirty years on a remote island in the South Seas since 1923, weep with gratitude.</p>
<p>On this island, there are no dense forests or mines like those in the Solomon Islands or New Guinea. There are only scattered coconut groves and breadfruit trees, dotted everywhere. It is such a flat island that is only a few meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Here, the situation of the war should be as it is now. At the same time, I cannot help but recall the smiling faces of the Japanese soldiers I saw when I left the island. At that time, they smiled at me and said, "As long as we are still alive, we will never let Roosevelt and Churchill smile even for one day."

<h3 id="e67">The Collapsing British Empire: Barely Surviving by Relying on Four Forces <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>As we commemorate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we can more clearly feel the magnitude of the war's impact on the disintegration of the British Empire. Furthermore, it has accelerated the decline of the British Empire. After France surrendered, Britain continued its isolated and unsupported resistance. The start of the German-Soviet war provided a brief respite, but unexpectedly, the Greater East Asia War erupted. The fall of Hong Kong and Singapore successively shattered the British Empire's defense system. The remaining India, influenced by Japanese victories, launched a large-scale anti-British movement. Even today, there is a view that the British Empire should be completely shattered. The tenacious British are now desperately trying to extricate themselves from this predicament. However, the post-war Britain not only needs to resist external military threats but must also continue to fight against various internal hostile forces that politically erode and devour the British Empire. This means that due to the outbreak of this war, the British Empire's lack of independent defense capabilities has become very clear. Britain today relies on the assistance of its Dominions, labor, the United States, and the Soviet Union, these four major forces, to barely survive. While these four forces are Britain's greatest allies in this critical moment, they are also extremely dangerous semi-hostile forces that seek to devour the British Empire. Britain's resistance is akin to a mad dance on the edge of a volcano.</p>
<p>The Defection of the Dominions</p>
<p>The earliest and most loyal supporters of Britain's resistance were its self-governing colonies. Britain, with its meager resources of materials and manpower, would have been unable to continue the war without the help of its territories. However, while Britain relied on the strength of its colonies to fight the war, the proportion of each colony in the British Empire's war effort increased as the war dragged on. Almost all the colonies became creditors to the British homeland, effectively reversing the roles of host and guest. Under such circumstances, even disregarding the anti-British Boers in South Africa, the Indian national movement, and the French-speaking population in Canada, it is only natural that Britain's colonies, especially the self-governing Dominions, show an increasing tendency towards independence and defection. The recent British Empire Aviation Conference held in London best demonstrates this trend. On one hand, the Dominions each demand their own special rights and interests; on the other hand, they refuse to accept matters entrusted by the home government. This situation has undermined the conditions for competing with foreign countries as a unified British Empire and clearly demonstrates the difficulty of rebuilding the pre-war Ottawa Agreement's cooperative structure. Therefore, in the current situation where other countries have not yet intervened, the Dominions can be said to be the most peaceful "enemies" of Britain.</p>
<p>Labor Class Resentment</p>
<p>Second only to the Dominions in supporting Britain's resistance is the British labor class. Churchill's formation of a cabinet and the outbreak of the German-Soviet war completely turned them towards supporting the war. However, there was no complete consensus between them and the government regarding the direction of the war. A wide gulf still separated them. For example, when Britain was in dire straits due to the fall of Singapore, anti-government movements centered on the labor class immediately surged, bringing the Churchill cabinet to the brink of collapse twice. From that time until the Indian rebellion in the summer and autumn of the same year and the North African landings in November, the British cabinet endured the greatest hardships of this war. This suffering was endured by blindly flattering and following the labor class.</p>
<p>That is to say, while welcoming Cripps into the wartime cabinet, while issuing blank checks to the Soviet Union for opening a second front, and while ordering the enactment of the Beveridge insurance plan, it certainly looked like a "Kerensky regime" was being established centered on Cripps. However, once India was suppressed and the North African landings were successful, Churchill immediately changed his attitude. Less than ten days after the North African landings, Cripps was squeezed out of the wartime cabinet, and Churchill loudly proclaimed, "I did not become Prime Minister to liquidate the British Empire!" This also happened around the time of the successful landings in North Africa. In early December, while the labor class had high expectations for wages, the immediate implementation of the Beveridge Plan was announced, thereby triggering internal divisions within the labor class over whether to reject the immediate implementation of certain provisions or demand their postponement. In this way, Churchill's work of dividing the labor class was successful. However, the labor class, dissatisfied with the government, has become increasingly radical. Therefore, as the war develops, especially with the changes in relations with the Soviet Union, it is difficult to predict the direction of the British labor class.</p>
<p>The Rightward Shift of the Cabinet</p>
<p>The most noteworthy measure taken by Churchill to counter this situation is the rightward shift of the cabinet. The two recent cabinet reshuffles have already established the absolute dominance of the Conservative Party in the wartime cabinet, and the trend towards the right is very obvious. Related to the rightward shift of the cabinet, and something we cannot ignore, is that while the British upper class loudly proclaims the overthrow of fascism, they are actually moving towards fascism themselves. Abandoning 19th-century democracy and adopting the idea of new democracy has become a new concept growing in Britain today. The content of so-called new democracy, namely dedication to the state, control of the economy, and the social policies resulting therefrom, clearly has the characteristics of a transitional product with fascist ideals. Conservative Party theorist Professor Carr has commented on the relationship between Hitler and new democracy, claiming that it is similar to the relationship between Napoleon, who spread the gospel of liberalism by force, and liberalism. As for the recent release of British fascist leader Mosley, although the reason given was that he was ill and unable to continue imprisonment, it is probably not entirely unrelated to this trend.</p>
<p>In this way, although the British labor class is currently prone to division, the radicalization of the labor class is always a prominent phenomenon in wartime. Therefore, in this war, large-scale domestic struggles will inevitably arise, which cannot be compared to those of the previous war. This observation is unlikely to be wrong.</p>
<p>American Plunder of Britain</p>
<p>Even more terrifying than the above threats is the American plan of annexation, which is currently underway in secret. In terms of resources, in terms of sea and air routes, and in terms of military strength, Britain is completely overwhelmed by the United States. American bases have been established in every strategic location of the British Empire, and the British Empire has been incorporated into the American defense system. One of the purposes of America's participation in the war is to "inherit the legacy of the British Empire." This is common knowledge. However, the specific form in which it will be carried out is a very subtle issue. Currently, the American attitude towards Britain already shows various anomalies. First, there is the bold and reckless theory of immediately merging Britain. Second, there is the theory of an American-British alliance, which has recently become a problem in powerful circles. This is advocated by New York Governor Dewey, the Republican Party's most powerful candidate for the succession. Third, there is Willkie's attitude: excluding Britain from interfering in American politics to support President Roosevelt; criticizing stubborn British imperialism; and valuing the Soviet Union more than Britain. Fourth, and most peculiarly, the pre-war isolationists have now become "defense imperialists." Using the defense of the United States as a pretext, they adopt a robber-like attitude of "plotting for wealth and harming life" towards Britain. For example, while they also advocate giving Japan the strongest blow, they also take advantage of Britain, inch by inch, to steal British bases, resources, and territories.</p>
<p>However, the American authorities' attitude towards Britain is even more insidious. Considering the overall situation, immediately dismantling the British Empire could cause great disadvantages and confusion for America's national defense and its ambition to dominate the world. Therefore, on the surface, they support the British Empire as much as possible, while gradually eroding British territorial interests in secret. For example, regarding the Indian issue, because Willkie seemed to favor the Indian National Congress, the American authorities prohibited him from entering India. The reason why the American authorities did this is that they support Britain's policy towards India on the premise of maintaining the British Empire. As a result, if the American authorities' current policy can be successfully implemented, then just as Britain today dominates its self-governing Dominions and other territories, will the United States not be able to dominate Britain in the future?</p>
<p>The Soviet Threat</p>
<p>Finally, we must discuss the Soviet Union, the force assisting Britain. There are many interesting similarities and differences between the Soviet Union's relationship with Britain and that of the United States. The similarities and differences between the elements of Soviet aid to Britain are compared below:</p>
<p>American aid to Britain is voluntary, while Soviet aid to Britain is to continue the war against Germany.</p>
<p>The United States cares about British territories, while the Soviet Union pays attention to the British homeland. Therefore, when the Soviet Union exerts its "semi-hostile" nature towards Britain, Britain will fall into the greatest danger, because the United States uses financial power as its main weapon, while the Soviet Union uses ideological power.</p>
<p>The United States, as a "semi-hostile force" towards Britain, attempts to gradually seize the British Empire while maintaining it, but the Soviet Union's hostility is even stronger, and it has the potential to use its red tentacles to shatter both the British homeland and the British Empire.</p>
<p>Britain's anxiety about the Soviet Union's advance into Europe is well-known. Regarding Poland, the Balkans, and other Eastern and Southeastern European issues, Central European issues, and Mediterranean issues, it already seems that everything has been defeated by the Soviet offensive. If this continues, Britain will have no place to stand. Although Britain has not yet launched an effective counterattack against the Soviet Union and pretends to be a mediator between the United States and the Soviet Union, there are already sufficient elements in Britain's policy that hint at a change in its attitude towards the Soviet Union, and it is likely to be clearly demonstrated during the opening of the second front. As for the degree and form, it will of course be mostly governed by the situation at the time. However, if Britain's attitude changes drastically, then the Soviet Union's counterattack will also be strong. In order to effectively counter the Soviet Union, whether it wants to or not, Britain will probably have to go deeper under American protection and become a sacrifice to American ambitions.</p>
<p>In summary, although Britain is desperately struggling to save itself, in this struggle, the "semi-hostile forces" are gaining ground step by step, and in the end, it will inevitably be devoured.</p>
<p>Intensifying Military Threats</p>
<p>On the other hand, the military threats imposed on Britain from the outside itself do not allow Britain to be optimistic about its future. Although the Axis powers currently seem to be adopting a defensive strategy as their basic strategy, they are also engaging in offensives within the defense, and the sharp edge of their offensives, whether from Germany or Japan, is aimed at the British Empire, making it their common target. For example, while the German army is adopting a defensive strategy on the main Eastern front, it is continuing to launch strong counterattacks and is also carrying out large-scale retreats from time to time. However, in this move to reorganize the Eastern front, there is the possibility of carrying out retaliatory bombing against Britain and other offensives against the British homeland. This is acknowledged by anti-Axis military experts. President Hitler also clearly stated in his speech on the anniversary of the previous Nazi uprising: "Even if we cannot reach America... there is one country within our reach, and we will resolutely act against it." This was of course directed at Britain. On the other hand, Japan in East Asia is also taking an offensive in its defensive posture on today's main battlefield, and it is clear that Japan's defense contains a great offensive. For example, while British Indian Army Commander Auchinleck dismisses the possibility of an offensive in Burma, Indian Provisional Government Chairman Bose is shouting "Advance on Delhi!" Germany's target is the stronghold of the British Empire, while Japan's target is the pillar of the British Empire, India. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" If the British homeland falls, there will naturally be no British India, but if India defects, the British Empire will also lose its substance.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot currently discern when the final offensive to decisively battle Britain will be launched. However, it is indeed very interesting that one of the major goals of the Axis powers is to overthrow the British Empire. At present, whether the anti-Axis offensive can be shattered and whether the overthrow of the British Empire can succeed seems to have become the key to victory or defeat in this war.

<h3 id="e68">Mine Warfare Flotilla: Pioneering Supply Routes —Completing a Non-Mandatory Mission— <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Our boat, with the naval ensign fluttering at its stern, was amidst the mine warfare flotilla, busy preparing to set sail. From one warship, it rowed to another. As it approached the side, young officers, one or two at a time, climbed from the boat onto the warship's ladder. Watching the figures of the officers climbing the ladder, we shouted, "Goodbye! Good luck!" while waving our hats with our right hands. As soon as the boat left the side, the sailors who had briefly stopped working to rest responded to our farewell, all desperately waving their naval caps. Finally, our boat pulled alongside the destroyer 〇〇. This time, it was our turn to be seen off. A crew member of the sweaty motorboat said:</p>
<p>—When this ship returns to port, we'll be the first to greet you. This is the luckiest ship. Since the Guadalcanal campaign, I don't know how many times it has gone to war, but it has always returned safely, so this time it will definitely be okay.</p>
<p>—Okay, goodbye! Thank you for everything!</p>
<p>—Well then, I wish you a safe journey!</p>
<p>These words of wishing the other party success and a safe journey were deeply etched on the hearts of those being seen off. The sincerity and enthusiasm of those seeing them off were fully expressed in them. There were truly no better words to be found.</p>
<p>Climbing aboard the destroyer 〇〇, the inside of the ship was bustling with activity. On this ship were army soldiers being sent to 〇〇 Island, supplies to replenish the front-line troops, and sailors mixed in between, scurrying back and forth. The deck was full. The army soldiers were very careful, trying not to do anything that would bother others, talking in groups behind the turrets and beside the ventilators. A smell of sweat and leather floated out of the cabins, a strange and unfamiliar smell that warships had never had before. The sailors ran over to the army soldiers and seemed to be talking very warmly, even taking care of them.</p>
<p>Observing the Sea</p>
<p>On the bridge, Captain 〇〇 and Navigator 〇〇 were studying the course on a chart with a compass. The lookout, with both hands on a pair of large binocular telescopes, although beads of sweat the size of soybeans were flowing down his forehead, was still observing intently. For some reason, this place was very quiet. The senior officer who was leading us said:</p>
<p>—Captain! The passengers have all been accommodated.</p>
<p>—Ah, well done! Then refuel and prepare to leave port on schedule! Communications officer, signal 〇〇!</p>
<p>Then the captain swiftly issued orders and immediately weighed anchor to proceed to the fueling ship. The captain finally came to us, apologizing and wiping his sweat, saying:</p>
<p>Our ship is going to 〇〇 this time for the 〇th time, but this time we plan to sail into the middle of 〇〇 Bay. It is said that the enemy aircraft have scattered mines in the harbor, so maybe there won't be any problems. We will arrive at Buin at 〇 o'clock tomorrow morning, and at 〇〇, maybe around 〇 o'clock in the evening. Malaria is very rampant in 〇〇, so be careful! Well then, this is my welcome speech. Go to the officers' mess and have some soda!</p>
<p>Because it was time to leave port, the captain seemed very busy. As we walked down from the bridge, we saw the senior officer, and the captain made a steering gesture, saying that this was really good. The captain said to tell everyone about the time when he was transporting with the same 〇〇 and was bombed by enemy aircraft, how he saw black bead-like bombs leaving the enemy aircraft and skillfully turned the rudder. The senior officer said that maybe it would happen again this time, but as long as it was the same captain, it would be okay. When the enemy's bombs were dodged by about thirty meters and fell into the sea, that was truly indescribably exhilarating. The senior officer said this, looking at us with an expression of great trust in the captain.</p>
<p>Our ship had unknowingly pulled alongside the fueling ship, sucking up heavy oil through a thick rubber hose. The sun was gradually setting in the west, and the naval aircraft that had set out this morning returned in neat formations. The air wing that had set out based on the news that enemy ships were concentrated near Lunga Point on Guadalcanal Island had just returned. One or two were missing from the formation; perhaps they were kamikaze planes! Although fighting was commonplace, today seemed particularly fierce. Naval aircraft landed on our ship, rumbling, one after another.</p>
<p>Last night we felt a strong earthquake on land. The more the earth shakes violently, the more intense the war becomes. This was 〇 days before the enemy landed on Rentaba Island, when the destroyer 〇〇, together with other friendly ships, ventured into an area under enemy air control to attack. In an instant, the ship gently swayed and set off. From then on, neither the captain nor the soldiers would be able to sleep or rest day and night. They would not only have to fight against enemy aircraft and enemy submarines but also against waterways full of coral reefs. From then on, they would only sail at a speed of 〇〇 knots, silently praying that they would complete the 〇〇 mission and launch a major operation. The sun sank into the sea, and the surroundings were all dark. Those seeing the ship off could only see the scattered lights of the signal lamps on the lookout tower.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Plunging into Enemy Airspace <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Are destroyers always destined for such hardship? The Solomon Sea, often described as calm, is in reality quite turbulent. Finally, unable to endure it any longer, I crawled into the bunk that the executive officer had helped prepare. I could hear the waves crashing against our warship, a ferocious roar like that of a tiger, a powerful "hum" sound. It was also extremely hot. Disregarding all formality, I stripped completely naked, yet my entire body felt as if submerged in water, with sweat constantly pouring down. Soon after, I vomited once. As I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, our warship picked up speed. From time to time, waves crashed onto the deck, and the ship's hull emitted a rushing sound. At the stroke of midnight, my throat parched, I went to the galley next to the officer's mess. There, the commissaryman (the cook) stood amidst the hazy heat, sweat streaming down his face like a fountain.</p>
<p>This place was many times hotter than where I had been trying to sleep. To prepare breakfast for the army soldiers on board, the commissaryman toiled through the night, cooking many times the usual amount of food.</p>
<p>The officer's mess was, of course, empty. The navigator, communications officer, and gunnery officer were undoubtedly all at the captain's side, performing their duties. Thinking of this, I felt that I was the only one on this warship sleeping peacefully, without a care in the world. This was a bit much. I scolded myself, "This is war!" I felt like vomiting again. That evening, a navigator from a merchant marine school said to me:</p>
<p>"If you can't sleep tonight, please come up to the bridge and hang out! If the weather is good, even at night, you might be able to see Mount Bagana on Bougainville Island!"</p>
<p>Although he invited me, in my condition, I really couldn't make it to the bridge. Mount Bagana was a common sight for our naval aviators, nothing extraordinary. Starting from the 〇〇 base, after only 〇〇 hours, the pilots of our naval air force, boldly heading out to attack, might find this volcano erupting with smoke and clouds extremely beautiful. An air squadron officer once said:</p>
<p>"Before getting on the plane after receiving orders, I do feel a bit nervous, but once I take off, I forget everything. Because the surroundings are so beautiful, I always think that even dying like this, melting into nature, would be quite nice. So when I'm in the plane heading out on a mission, I feel truly refreshed. I feel like a true High King. Especially when I open the lunchbox that the commissaryman has painstakingly prepared, eat the delicious food, drink the fragrant tea, and gaze at the colorful, charming scenery, there's an indescribable sense of beauty."</p>
<p>The Philosophy of Death</p>
<p>Embracing a torpedo and charging towards an enemy ship in an attack plane might be a matter of bravado. This officer simply connected his philosophy of death and the beauty of nature at a higher altitude above us, which is a rather optimistic approach. Nevertheless, I, seasick and vomiting amidst the beautiful nightscape of the South Sea, as the mine squadron advanced in a single column, was truly a pathetic sight.</p>
<p>On the higher mast of the bridge, the sailors who were silently standing watch in the round bucket that they call the "pigeon coop" were probably holding the same sentiment as that air squadron officer. At the same time, the soldiers who couldn't neglect aerial observation for even a second, even at night, and were focusing their attention on the faint light of the stars through their binoculars, had certainly transcended the concept of death. Our ship, with all lights extinguished, was simply pushing forward into the sea of battle. In this beautiful and tense atmosphere, our ship, though in an area where enemy submarines appeared and disappeared unpredictably, did not encounter any, and at 〇 hours, entered the port near Buin.</p>
<p>On the snow-white sandy beach, dotted with clusters of coconut trees and the scattered, lush branches of mangroves (a type of tropical evergreen tree) even drooping to the sea, with the distant Mount Taroka towering in the clouds behind, everything looked extremely rugged, but our land troops seemed completely like lost sheep, unaware of where they were. The executive officer came running and said:</p>
<p>"Asleep? I blinked slightly. How are you!"</p>
<p>This officer, as well as all the officers and sailors I encountered on deck, had hardly slept at all last night. Their eyes were all bloodshot. Although their eyelids looked a bit swollen, everyone seemed unaware of fatigue, moving back and forth, operating. Because our ship had already anchored, the sailors who were off-duty spread out straw mats on the back of the deck, curled up like shrimp, and were snoring loudly.</p>
<p>A launch was lowered from a friendly ship, and officers with public duties came on the launch to meet with our captain. Based on enemy intelligence, the operational plan regarding the route, speed, and passage through various waterways had to be discussed.</p>
<p>In fact, the busiest person on the warship was the captain. Perhaps no one will be able to sleep tonight either. Most of the Solomon Islands are barren. In the worst places, even water has to be transported by ship. Therefore, ammunition, and of course all food supplies, must rely on rear support. However, in order to complete this transport mission deep within enemy airspace, it is necessary to operate at night and withdraw from enemy airspace early in the day. The only type of ship capable of carrying out such a mission is a destroyer.</p>
<p>Therefore, the task assigned to the mine squadron is transportation, not its original task. So, since the enemy landed on Lunga Point, although there haven't been any major battles worth mentioning, a supply war, unseen on the continental front, is being waged. In such a place, this is of vital importance, and the war is constantly and invariably waged day and night. (Translated by Shi Yan from the November 24th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e70">British Military Defeat: Memoirs and Reflections <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Li Haibo</p>
<p>The article recorded here is a memoir by Lieutenant General Percival, former commander of the British forces in Malaya, reflecting on the defeat. It is sufficient to prove that the Japanese army's combat capability was far superior to that of the British army.</p>
<p>The Malayan campaign was a campaign in which the Japanese army launched a desperate attack, demonstrating their national spirit. The British had spent a hundred years in Malaya, building a seemingly impenetrable defense line. However, the Japanese army fought valiantly, engaging in battles across a vast theater stretching hundreds of kilometers, without showing any signs of fatigue. General Percival, commander of the defeated forces, upon the commencement of hostilities by the Japanese army, immediately mobilized the large British, Indian, and Australian forces distributed across the four military districts of Malaya, striving to conduct a defensive war. However, they ultimately could not withstand the surging Japanese forces, and the defensive operation collapsed, their arrows exhausted and blades broken, resulting in a complete rout. The seemingly impregnable fortress of Singapore finally raised the white flag and surrendered.</p>
<p>Percival described the entire course of this defeat very clearly, dividing it into fourteen chapters. According to his account, the seizure of the Kota Bharu airfield in various battles, the breakthrough of the Zaidra defense line by the Saeki unit on the Leda front, the fierce battle of the Slim River, the efforts of the Gotanda tank unit in the crossing of the Muar River, the battle of Singapore, and the activity of the Japanese air force posed a significant threat to the British army and were major factors leading to the British surrender. All of these facts are described in the enemy general's own words.</p>
<p>Initial British Military Deployment</p>
<p>The initial deployment of the British forces took into account the following three points:</p>
<p>Defense of Singapore Island 　 Defense of coastlines suitable for landing operations　 Defense of airfields. In the northern sector, these airfields had two main areas: one was the Kelantan region, and the other was the Wellesley region of Kedah State. Based on the above considerations, the Malayan military district was divided into the following four districts. 　 The Singapore Fortress Area was under the command of Major General Keith Simmons, who also commanded the fortress, infantry, and mobile units. 　 The Australian Army, under the command of Major General Bennett, was responsible for the defense of Johor and Malacca. 　 The Indian III Corps, under the command of Lieutenant General Heath, was responsible for the defense of northern Johor and the entire territory of Malacca. The Indian III Corps was composed of the Indian 9th and 11th Divisions, deployed as follows:</p>
<p>Indian 9th Division (with a brigade stationed in the Kota Bharu area, and a brigade in the Kuantan area), Indian 11th Division (a brigade south of Zaidra (northern Kedah State), a brigade at Sungei Patani, a brigade at Ipoh).</p>
<p>Air defense focused on the defense of Singapore and was directly under the command of the Malayan Military Headquarters. The mobile air defense units in the northern region were under the command of the Indian III Corps.</p>
<p>The Start of the Japanese Military Offensive</p>
<p>Before the Japanese military offensive began, we had already made complete preparations for defense, taking into account the general international situation. On the evening of December 7th, our aircraft discovered a Japanese convoy about seventy miles off the coast of Songkhla, confirming that preparations had been completed. The purpose of the garrison in the Kelantan area, responsible for the defense of Kelantan, was to secure the airfields for our aircraft. The area was too vast for the garrison to defend, but it was believed that the garrison could prevent the initial Japanese attack and inflict considerable damage on the Japanese. Subsequently, the Japanese offensive progressed, and the airfields became unusable due to the heavy bombing by the Japanese air force, forcing our aircraft to withdraw.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, our air force had no reason to hold on to these airfields. On the morning of December 8th, the Kedah front troops received orders to move to the Zaidra defense line, learning that the Japanese had landed in Songkhla. Reconnaissance aircraft were also dispatched, and at the same time, the Japanese forces in Kroh were ordered to seek advantageous positions.</p>
<p>The Withdrawal from Kelantan</p>
<p>By December 11th, it was necessary to make a decision regarding the mission of the troops in Kelantan. Given the fact that the airfields there were unusable and the enemy's full-scale offensive southward along the west coast became increasingly apparent, it was decided to withdraw the troops from Kelantan.</p>
<p>The Situation in Kedah</p>
<p>By the end of the first week of the war, the situation in Kedah was extremely dangerous. The Indian 11th Division, lacking combat experience, retreated under the Japanese offensive. The rapid retreat and chaotic disorder caused considerable damage in terms of personnel and equipment. Moreover, there was a risk of a central breakthrough between the Kedah and Kroh lines. As a result, the following measures were decided upon:</p>
<p>The reserve, the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, was deployed to the Wellesley region and placed under the command of the Indian III Corps. 　 Even a very small number of units, which were no longer usable, needed to be transferred to Kedah State to fight. Therefore, the defense of Penang was abandoned. Furthermore, in this situation, it was most important to maintain absolute air superiority in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, because the Japanese army deployed a considerable number of fighters in southern Thailand. Therefore, the Japanese army only had to attack Penang, which had no air defense facilities, and monitor our troop movements to disrupt our communication lines.</p>
<p>Retreat to Northern Perak</p>
<p>With the assistance of the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, the connection between Kedah and Kroh was maintained. By around December 8th, this position was held along the line of the Krian River. However, before December 8th, the Indian 11th Division had already suffered considerable damage and become a very fragile force. Meanwhile, a small detachment still held the Grik Road. This location was the best position in northern Perak because the attack it faced was relatively limited. Because the Japanese forces attacking the Grik Road threatened to cut off the troops stationed in the Taiping area, the defense of that position was only temporary. Therefore, it was necessary to retreat to the position east of the Perak River. This position was not a naturally good one. Water and land routes ran parallel, so our communication organs on the land route were often attacked by Japanese forces attempting to cross the Perak River. Another position was selected and its front line placed at Kampar. This position was chosen because the terrain was relatively open, allowing for the full use of artillery.</p>
<p>The Withdrawal from Kuantan</p>
<p>Around the end of December, it was planned to have a division arrive to defend the Kuantan area. It was extremely important to secure the Kuantan airfield for as long as possible. Why was it necessary to preserve it? Because if it were occupied by the Japanese, the risk of air raids on Singapore would immediately increase. On the other hand, if the west coast line were pushed back, communication with Kuantan would be cut off. At that time, there was no direct attack on Kuantan, but there were some contacts on the lightly defended positions north of Terengganu. The method of withdrawing troops from Kuantan was gradual, because the ferry capacity in the Gelang area was limited. In order to strengthen the west coast operations, it was decided to withdraw these troops, with the withdrawal scheduled to be completed by mid-January. However, before the withdrawal was completed, the Japanese army attacked the Kuantan airfield from the north.</p>
<p>The Battle of Slim River</p>
<p>By early January, the Japanese army had almost completely secured air superiority and sea communication along the west coast of Malaya. The threat to our communications became even greater. Therefore, it was necessary to form special units by deploying artillery units to monitor this coast. Some volunteers and one or two units were also moved from the east coast. Although such measures were taken, the Japanese continued to land, and the threat to our communications did not decrease, but rather increased. During the weekend of the first week of January, the Japanese army won a major victory in the Battle of the Slim River in southern Perak. The Japanese army used tanks to defeat two of our front-line brigades. The personnel and equipment of the two brigades suffered great damage, and they were almost useless as combat units. As a result of this battle and the continuous fighting in January, the Indian 11th Division was unable to maintain its defensive position north of Kuala Lumpur. Moreover, there were many roads in the Kuala Lumpur area and to its south, and the constant threat from the sea made defense in this area even more difficult. It was decided to retreat to the northern region of Johor in the rear. The Indian 9th Division also needed to take the same steps as the 11th Division and retreat.</p>
<p>The Battle of Northern Johor</p>
<p>The northern Johor region was not an easy area to defend, especially against an enemy with naval supremacy. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>There were two main roads: the Kuala Lumpur Road and the Coastal Road. There was also a road that could be used for movement.</p>
<p>Rubber plantations were highly developed there, and almost every area could be traversed by troops. On the other hand, because the main airfields were located on the Mawai-Kluang-Batu Pahat Road, it was necessary to fight north of this road. For the operations in the northern Johor region, a new Western Army was established under the command of Major General Bennett. Its formation consisted of the Australian Army (a brigade in Mawai), the Indian 9th Division, and the Indian 45th Infantry Brigade (recently arrived from India). Initially, Major General Bennett's deployment was as follows:</p>
<p>The Australian Army and the Indian 9th Division were stationed in positions north of Segamat, with a small force ambushing north of Gemas. 　 The Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, supported by some Australian artillery units, was responsible for monitoring the Muar River crossing point on the Coastal Road. The remaining areas of Johor were under the command of the Third Indian Corps, with its headquarters in Simpang Renggam. Its units were all engaged in rear area tasks. 　 A brigade of Australian troops in the Mawai area came into contact with the Japanese forces pressing our troops in the Gemas area. Our ambush troops achieved great results, and it is believed that several Japanese tanks and a large number of Japanese troops were put out of action. However, at this time, the Japanese forces advancing along the Coastal Road had successfully crossed the Muar River and were attacking our troops defending the Muar River area. In order to support the Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, a large number of Australian troops were dispatched (these were troops withdrawn from Segamat and Mawai), and a large detachment of the newly arrived 53rd Infantry Brigade (18th Division) was also sent to defend the high ground west of Yong Peng. The Indian 6th and 15th Mixed Brigades were ordered to move from Kluang to Batu Pahat. Because the rear roads were blocked, communication with our Muar area defense forces was cut off. As a result, the main forces still engaged in combat in the Segamat area were directly threatened. An order was immediately issued for these troops to break contact with the enemy and immediately retreat from Kluang to the Ayer Hitam position. This operation was carried out smoothly, and all troops withdrew safely with only very few casualties. The new deployment was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(A) A brigade of the Indian 9th Division was stationed in Kluang, and the Australian Army was stationed in Ayer Hitam. A brigade of the Indian 9th Division in the Yong Peng area served as a reserve for the above units. All of the above units were under the command of Major General Bennett.</p>
<p>(B) The Indian 12th Division stationed its advance units in Batu Pahat, deployed on the Coastal Road. An Australian brigade remained in the Mawai area. These units were under the command of the Third Indian Corps. In order to reduce the danger of air raids on Singapore, it was most important to hold the Kluang airfield and prevent the Japanese from capturing it. Therefore, an order was issued: the battle in this area should be prolonged as much as possible.</p>
<p>The Landing at Endau</p>
<p>At this time, a small number of Japanese troops made a small-scale landing at Endau. Our air force attacked their ships, but only after the Japanese had already landed. The Japanese army advanced towards Mawai and engaged the Australian troops who had established positions there. The Japanese advance was not very rapid, so they did not seem to feel threatened.</p>
<p>The Battle Near Batu Pahat</p>
<p>For about a week, the 6th and 15th Brigades continued to fight in Batu Pahat to protect the left flank of the Kluang and Ayer Hitam defense forces. After the road between Batu Pahat and Ayer Hitam was blocked, the only route available to this unit was the Coastal Road. Around January 26th, even the main road to Yong Peng in the rear was cut off. The attempt by the 6th and 15th Brigades to break through the encirclement failed. Therefore, the brigade had to abandon most of its baggage and equipment, and the troops retreated by water and land. Because the Coastal Road was blocked and there were no other usable units, if the Japanese army advanced south along this road, all allied forces fighting in Kluang and Ayer Hitam would be cut off by the Japanese. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw all units fighting in Johor State to Singapore Island during the last week of January. This withdrawal was completed before January 31st, with the exception of the Indian 22nd Infantry Brigade of the Indian 9th Division, which was stationed near the railway south of Rengam and could not contact the main force, and was mostly captured by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Defense of Singapore Island</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war, all efforts were concentrated on defending the coast of Singapore Island, but there were no defensive fortifications along the northern coast. Although efforts were made to carry out these defensive measures as much as possible during the fighting, it was ultimately too late. Even when Singapore was evacuated, the defensive works were not complete. The deployment of troops was as follows:</p>
<p>The Australian Army: commanded the Indian 44th Infantry Brigade (recently arrived from India), stationed in the fourth region of the island, including the Causeway. 　 The Third Indian Corps: adjacent to the Australian Army, stationed in the northern region, including Kranji. The corps was composed of the Indian 11th Division (after reorganization) on its left flank and the 18th Division (its remnants recently arrived in Singapore) on its right flank. 　 The southern region, including the southern region of the island of Kranji and the defense of Pasir Panjang, Bukit Timah, and Ponggol. The general defense plan was to inflict heavy damage on forces attempting to cross the Johor Strait, so outposts were stationed on the coast, defensive strongholds were selected internally, and a reserve force was prepared for a counterattack. All commanders were ordered to send reserve forces to assist neighboring units if they received requests for assistance.</p>
<p>The Battle of Singapore</p>
<p>The Japanese army concentrated artillery fire on the northeast of the island, attempting to divert our attention to that area. However, our reconnaissance teams received reports that strong Japanese forces were concentrating in the opposite area from the northeast. It was naturally expected that the Japanese would land on the northwest coast. Regardless of whether their first landing was carried out, the Australian Army and the Malayan Military Headquarters first dispatched a reserve force to the Tengah area. All efforts were devoted to preserving the positions already laid out between Jurong and Tuas. On February 10th (Tuesday), it was decided to reinforce these forces with troops drawn from the 18th Division. By the morning of the 11th (Wednesday), Bukit Timah Village and the racecourse, which had large reserve forces, had been lost. Every effort was made to keep the positions near Adam Road intact. On the 12th (Thursday), it was necessary to retreat from the northern region. This was the 18th Division. The Indian 11th Division and troops from the naval base area and the southeast coast also retreated. This retreat took place on the evening of the 12th (Thursday). As a result, by the 13th (Friday), positions were built around Singapore City in the areas of Kallang Airport, Vita Valley, MacRitchie Reservoir, Adam Road, and Alexandra. On the 14th (Saturday), water pipes and water mains were damaged by air raids and artillery fire, making water supply to Singapore difficult. By the morning of the 15th (Friday), the supply situation was even more pressing. According to water experts, there was only enough water for one more week. This was the biggest reason for deciding to surrender on the 15th.</p>
<p>The Air Situation</p>
<p>In this memoir, the air situation is hardly mentioned, because this situation was very obvious not only to the British army but also to the Japanese side. Because of the British commitment to missions in other theaters, it was not possible to deploy the necessary air force strength to Malaya. As a result, the Japanese army gained air superiority in the first few days and maintained this air superiority until the end, never losing it. This had a huge impact on us. In particular, it was impossible to launch actions without the enemy knowing, especially in coastal operations, which resulted in many attacks. Actions in Singapore City were also severely affected, making it difficult to repair airfields or carry out dock work.</p>
<p>Note: Because the Air Force was separate from the Army, there was no position to elaborate on matters concerning the Air Force.</p>
<p>The Reasons for the Japanese Victory</p>
<p>In my opinion, the main reason for the Japanese victory was their rapid advance, which was due to a combination of the following reasons:</p>
<p>The Japanese army had the ability to reside in this area for a longer period compared to the British army.</p>
<p>The Japanese army received assistance in terms of road transportation.</p>
<p>The Japanese army possessed the agility and determination to quickly overcome obstacles (such as rivers, swamps, etc.) and quickly repair damaged objects.</p>

<h3 id="e71">The Responsibility for the Rupture of Japanese-American Negotiations <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Two years ago, on November 26th, the relationship between Japan and the United States had essentially reached a state of collapse. On that day, the United States presented its final proposal to the Japanese representatives, Nomura and Kurusu. It was essentially a beautifully worded declaration of war by the United States against Japan, which even some of their own people later admitted was unacceptable. In January 1943, the U.S. State Department published a booklet entitled "Peace and War" (U.S. Foreign Policy, 1931-1941), detailing the past ten years of U.S. foreign policy, particularly the "truth" about Japanese-American relations and the breakdown of Japanese-American negotiations. The apparent purpose of the U.S. government in publishing this book was to demonstrate their "fair stance" in the Japanese-American negotiations to both domestic and foreign audiences, and to shift the responsibility and blame for provoking the war onto Japan. However, within the thousands of words of the book, the challenging attitude of the United States towards Japan at the time, their wishful thinking, and their policy of both intimidation and appeasement were exposed without reservation. This was probably something they did not anticipate. It is difficult to present the entire booklet here due to space constraints. Therefore, I will extract two or three points from Chapters XII and XIV regarding the Japanese-American negotiations to expose American deception and concealment.</p>
<p>The United States Lacked Sincerity in Negotiations</p>
<p>The first point to note is that the highest authorities in the United States had no hope or sincerity in establishing negotiations from the beginning. In other words, they were merely using this as a means to delay the start of the war in order to complete their own war preparations and cultivate public sentiment in favor of war. The following excerpts will clarify that this statement is not rash.</p>
<p>1. "The President and the heads of the Army, Navy, and State Departments were in complete agreement that involving the United States in the war was less appropriate than adopting economic measures against Japan, given the current public opinion in the United States and the insufficient military preparations." (Page 58, Chapter XII)</p>
<p>(Note) The reason why the heads of the U.S. government did not impose sanctions on Japan until June 1938, a year after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, is now self-evident.</p>
<p>2. "Ambassador Grew in Japan submitted his opinion to the U.S. government on September 12, 1940, as follows:</p>
<p>"If the United States can maintain the status quo in the Pacific until Britain succeeds in the European war... then the United States may have the possibility of adjusting the entire Pacific issue." (Page 62, Chapter XII)</p>
<p>(Note) The so-called "adjustment" means forcing Japan to submit, which is a U.S.-style diplomatic euphemism.</p>
<p>3. "In the spring of 1941, before the start of the Japanese-American negotiations, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, after exchanging views, fully recognized that due to the extreme nature of Japan's policy of conquest, it was impossible to stop Japan's advance. Therefore, the hope for establishing a fair and peaceful agreement in the East Asian region was very slim. (Note: This refers to the fact that Ambassador Nomura revealed the Japanese side's sincere attitude towards starting negotiations after taking office.)</p>
<p>The U.S. government had to agree to begin preliminary talks in order to determine whether a full agreement could be reached on the basic issues that could be brought into formal talks." (Page 77, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>(Note) It is impossible to find any hope or sincerity for the United States to maintain peace in the Pacific in this narrative.</p>
<p>4. Negotiations regarding the Konoe-Roosevelt meeting -</p>
<p>Japanese proposal</p>
<p>"On August 28, 1941, Prime Minister Konoe submitted the following document to President Roosevelt through the Japanese ambassador:</p>
<p>"Continuing informal preliminary talks and having the leaders of both countries confirm the conclusions are not suitable for the current situation, where unexpected events may erupt. Therefore, it is necessary for the leaders of both governments to meet and discuss various issues concerning the entire Pacific from a broad perspective." (Page 83, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>American response</p>
<p>"During the meeting on the same day (Note: August 28th), Secretary of State Hull pointed out to Ambassador Nomura: "The United States hopes to establish a principled agreement on the main issues before the Konoe-Roosevelt meeting. If the summit meeting fails, the result will be very serious. Therefore, the purpose of such a meeting should be to have important points on which both sides agree in advance." (Page 84, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>When considering the Japanese proposal, the U.S. government noted the following facts: Prime Minister Konoe was the Prime Minister of Japan at the time of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1937... The highest authorities in Japan attending the summit meeting were responsible for implementing Japanese policy since 1931... Even if the meeting reached a principled understanding, Japan would act according to its own interpretation... If the meeting failed, Japan would place the responsibility on the United States." (Pages 84-85, Chapter XIV) (Note) From this, it can be seen that the United States was nitpicking on everything in order to obstruct the negotiations.</p>
<p>Various Perspectives on American Demands</p>
<p>The second point that must be pointed out is that the American demands in the Japanese-American negotiations were based on an arrogant and disrespectful viewpoint. They expressed these demands using either threatening words and tempting attitudes, or by making wild statements to the defendant, and published them separately with a straight face. Using the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact, the issue of withdrawing troops from China and Indochina, and the issue of equal opportunity in international commerce, which were the biggest obstacles in the negotiations, as the center, I will quote the original text of the book as follows:</p>
<p>1. The U.S. attitude towards the Tripartite Pact</p>
<p>"On May 11, 1941, Hull stated during a meeting with Ambassador Nomura:</p>
<p>"The United States is well aware that Hitlerism is a scourge not only to Europe, but also to the rest of the world. Not only that, but the United States is also convinced that Japan, like the European countries under the control of Hitler, will suffer from its misfortune in the near future." (Page 77, Chapter XIV) (Note) This is a malicious attempt to alienate Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>"On July 23, 1941, immediately after the Japanese army was stationed in southern French Indochina, Undersecretary of State Welles stated during a meeting with Ambassador Nomura:</p>
<p>"The agreements concluded between Japan and the Vichy government were all achieved by Germany putting pressure on Vichy. Therefore, the Japanese-Vietnamese agreement can be interpreted as supporting Germany's world domination policy." (Page 79, Chapter XIV) (Note) This clearly reveals the shallowness of the United States' understanding of the situation in East Asia.</p>
<p>During the Nomura-Kurusu-Roosevelt-Hull meeting on November 17, 1941,</p>
<p>"Hull said: "If Japan still stubbornly adheres to the Tripartite Pact, then any agreement regarding the Pacific region cannot be considered sincere. As a result of Hitler's military expansion throughout the world, the United States is in imminent danger. Therefore, the United States must promptly request self-defense measures." (Page 88, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>(Note) Behind these words lies the determination to declare war on Germany. The reason why the United States interfered with Japan's departure from the Tripartite Pact was that it feared that Japan would declare war on the United States based on the Tripartite Pact when a war broke out between Germany and the United States. Therefore, it wanted to make Japan an onlooker before defeating Germany.</p>
<p>2. The U.S. position on the troop withdrawal issue</p>
<p>"The intention of this proposal is to have foreign troops withdraw completely from Vietnam or China. At that time, the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China was virtually complete (Note: This refers to the measures taken to withdraw all U.S. Marines stationed in China, who were fighting the Japanese army, and move them to the Philippines and other places.) The withdrawal of the last unit is also underway. In addition, the British also withdrew from China (Note: The purpose is the same as the U.S. military.) Therefore, it is proposed that Japan also withdraw its land, sea, and air forces and police from China and Indochina." (Page 92, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>Nomura-Kurusu-Hull meeting on December 1st!</p>
<p>"Hull said. "The Japanese army's advance into Vietnam is a threat to the southern region." (Page 93. Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>(Note) Isn't it they who formed the so-called ABCD encirclement against Japan?</p>
<p>Nomura-Welles meeting on July 23, 1941!</p>
<p>"Undersecretary of State Welles said: "According to Japan's explanation, the Japanese army's advance into southern Vietnam is only intended to secure rice and raw materials, and to counter a certain country's attempt to encircle Japan. However, if the ongoing negotiations between Nomura and Hull can be satisfactorily resolved, Japan will be able to obtain greater economic guarantees than occupying Indochina. Moreover, the U.S. policy is neither an encirclement policy nor a policy of threatening Japan." (Page 80. Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>(Note) This is truly a blatant argument that sounds like it's meant to deceive children.</p>
<p>August 17, 1941. A note from Roosevelt to Japan, handed to Ambassador Nomura!</p>
<p>"If the Japanese government takes any further actions based on its policy or plan to militarily dominate or threaten neighboring countries, the United States will immediately implement all means deemed necessary to protect its own rights and the safety of its people." (Page 80, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>Nomura-Hull meeting on March 8, 1941 —</p>
<p>"Hull said, "Are there three countries organizing armies and navies before the eyes of the United States, wanting to conquer the seven seas of the world, as well as all commercial routes and the four continents outside of the Americas? Does Japan want the United States to stand by and watch?" (Page 76, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>3. The U.S. attitude towards the issue of equal commercial opportunities</p>
<p>"Although Japan has made great efforts to comply with the principle of non-discrimination in international commercial relations, it has refused to relinquish the special status it has acquired in the Japanese-occupied areas in practice." (Page 90, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>(Note) However, Japan actually "hopes to implement this principle in all countries of the world, and has expressed its willingness to comply with its implementation and strive to apply it to the Pacific region, including China, and has clarified that it does not exclude any fair economic activities of third countries in China." (Japanese Memorandum to the United States on December 8th) Therefore, there is no doubt that the U.S. side deliberately distorted the Japanese side's position. Moreover, the United States, regarding its monopolization of the Americas under the name of Pan-Americanism, brazenly attempted to indirectly argue for its Monroe Doctrine with the following explanation.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador-Hull meeting on April 20, 1940—</p>
<p>"Hull said that the difference between the United States' Monroe Doctrine and the Monroe Doctrine claimed by Japan is like the difference between black and white, that is, the United States' Monroe Doctrine is only a means to protect its own material security, while Japan believes that it can be applied to all purposes, including economic, political, and social purposes." (Page 60, Chapter XII)</p>
<p>A de facto Ultimatum</p>
<p>The third noteworthy point is that the proposal of November 26 was, in fact, an ultimatum, and that they inadvertently revealed that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was not a "sneak attack."</p>
<p>1. Ambassador Grew reported to his government on January 27, 1941—</p>
<p>"We have obtained information from various sources that the Japanese military authorities have formulated a plan for a large-scale surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in the event of a dispute between Japan and the United States." (Page 76, Chapter XIV.</p>
<p>2. Grew's report of November 3 of the same year—</p>
<p>"Judging from the various events that have occurred so far, it is difficult to agree with the view that a complete embargo can avoid war in East Asia... My purpose is to prevent the mistaken judgment that Japan does not have the ability to wage a "suicidal war" with the United States, because this kind of misjudgment may promote the United States to be involved in a long war... It is foreseeable that Japan is likely to take dangerous measures that make war between Japan and the United States inevitable." (Page 87, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>3. On November 7, Secretary of State Hull reported at the Cabinet meeting—</p>
<p>"Secretary of State Hull reported at the Cabinet meeting on November 7 that Japanese-American relations were facing a major crisis, and that Japan was likely to launch new military actions at any time. Therefore, the Cabinet agreed that our country should immediately respond to the development of this situation, and that the critical situation should be emphasized in speeches. Based on this decision, Secretary of the Navy Knox gave a speech on November 11, 1941, warning that the United States not only had to take extraordinary self-defense measures in the Atlantic, but was also facing ominous possibilities in the Pacific." (Page 87, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>4. Grew's report of November 17—</p>
<p>"The Japanese Army and Navy are in danger of launching torpedo attacks in areas not included in the scope of the Sino-Japanese Incident, and we must be closely vigilant." (Page 88, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>5. Hull's statement at the Supreme Leaders' Meeting on November 25 and 28. This statement was made shortly before and after the U.S. issued the final ultimatum.</p>
<p>"Secretary of State Hull emphasized the critical nature of Japanese-American relations at the government leaders' meeting on November 25 and 28. According to Hull, the possibility of establishing an agreement with Japan was virtually non-existent. He believed that there was still a fear that Japan would take new military action. The United States should now transfer the issue of defending national security to the Army and Navy. The United States must promptly establish a military defense plan. Because Japan regards the element of surprise as the core of its strategy, Hull argued that it should be assumed that the Japanese army will launch attacks simultaneously in many locations." (Page 92, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>6. November 29, Hull meets with the British Ambassador—</p>
<p>"Hull conferred with the British Ambassador on November 29, stating: "The diplomatic relations between the United States and Japan have virtually come to an end. The issue will now be transferred to the Army and Navy authorities." (Pages 92-93, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>(Note) The report of Judge Roberts, the head of the investigation into the truth about the defeat at Pearl Harbor, also stated: "On November 27, 1941 (Note: i.e., the day after the United States submitted the memorandum to Japan), Army Chief of Staff Marshall notified Lieutenant General Walter Short, commander of the Hawaiian Army District, that negotiations with Japan had broken down. On the same day, the Chief of Naval Operations also notified Admiral Kimmel, commander of the Pacific Fleet, and ordered him to implement preparations for carrying out war missions."</p>
<p>Active Cooperation between the U.S. and Britain</p>
<p>Finally, it must be mentioned that Britain was actively cooperating in the offensive against Japan. This was proposed by the United States, and as a result, the phrase "Japan's great ambition to advance into the Indian Ocean" was created.</p>
<p>August 9, 1941, Hull-British Ambassador meeting—</p>
<p>"Hull said that Japan is about to use force to advance into the Indian Ocean and the continents and islands connected to it, isolate China, and extend its tentacles to the mouth of the Suez Canal, the Persian Gulf oil fields, and the Cape of Good Hope area. As a result, it plans to block trade routes and supply sources to the British mainland. Such a large-scale action would probably be more harmful to the defense of British Europe than the German army crossing the English Channel... If Japan advances further south in the future, the U.S. and British governments should naturally immediately discuss countermeasures." (Page 82, Chapter XIV)</p>
<p>(Note) Roosevelt and Churchill held their first meeting on the Atlantic Ocean and decided on concrete countermeasures for the offensive against Japan, as well as the so-called Atlantic Charter, after Hull made these remarks. The sailing of the "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" to Singapore was after this Roosevelt-Churchill meeting at sea. (Source: Evening Edition of Yomiuri Hochi, November 24-25)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Way to Achieve Overall Peace <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yunxuan</p>
<p>How to achieve overall peace? In a nutshell, Chongqing can realize the fallacy of the war of resistance in time, resolutely abandon the war of resistance policy of clinging to Britain and the United States, and end the state of war within China, then overall peace can naturally be quickly achieved in the shortest possible time. But why does Chongqing advocate continuing the war of resistance? If we want to achieve overall peace, we must first dissect the anti-Japanese elements in Chongqing. In the past, many people who discussed the anti-Japanese issue in Chongqing were constrained by a kind of restraint in their hearts, so they hid what they wanted to say, and as a result, the arguments were not straightforward or sufficient. The Shen Bao's open essay contest to commemorate the first anniversary of its resumption is undoubtedly the best opportunity for us to express our opinions. I will say a few words from the standpoint of the Chinese people. I hope that the wise men of the allied countries will correct and criticize any mistakes.</p>
<p>The reason why the general Chinese intellectual class developed a distaste for Japan began with the September 18th Incident in Manchuria. At that time, due to emotional impulse, they harbored the idea that Japan would not give up the three northeastern provinces after the September 18th Incident. After the Manchurian Incident, the Chinese intellectual class misunderstood Japan's policy toward China and spared no effort in propagating anti-Japanese policies. The general public, influenced by propaganda, developed suspicion due to misunderstanding. The January 28th Shanghai Incident and the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident were both caused by this kind of anti-Japanese propaganda. Currently, the intellectual class under Chongqing who are promoting the war of resistance to recover lost territory also use the Manchurian Incident as the only propaganda target. The Manchurian Incident has prevented the Chinese intellectual class from thoroughly understanding the righteousness of Japan's actions, and has had a great impact on their thinking. Therefore, it has become a stalemate in Chongqing's compromise with Japan. This is one of the important reasons why Chongqing advocates continuing the war of resistance.</p>
<p>After Japan implemented its new policy toward China, the anti-Japanese sentiment under the rule of Chongqing had gradually weakened. Recently, with the signing of the Japan-China Alliance Treaty, Japan agreed to withdraw its troops stationed in China when a state of overall peace and war between the two countries was terminated. This move will at least increase many new understandings of peace in the anti-war camp. Chongqing currently relies on foreign aid to fight, and there is a great crisis of becoming an appendage of the British and American fronts. The inner suffering is needless to say, but if it resolutely breaks away from the anti-Axis front, will Japan use China as an allied country and make China a military supply depot for Japan? China has been ravaged by war for many years, and the fields have become ruins. If we immediately take care of the situation, recruit refugees, make the people live in peace, and restore the old appearance, it will take several or even decades to succeed. If overall peace is achieved in a short period of time, we will naturally spare no effort to build a new China. Will Japan extend the control and allocation system to China at will and use economic means to bind China's free economic development? The people under the rule of Chongqing have the above-mentioned doubts, so they cannot dispel the anti-Japanese prejudices. This is the second reason for the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The Chongqing authorities have always believed that the Democratic Entente will win. In the past two years of the Greater East Asia War, although they could not help but be shocked by the Japanese army's repeated victories, they were hardly able to fully understand the truth of the Japanese army's achievements under the cover of British and American propaganda. Chongqing's newspapers have further concealed the failures of Britain and the United States. Although this is partly because they fear that it will cause the people who are infatuated with Britain and the United States to waver, it is also partly due to the oppression of the American propaganda advisors in Chongqing. This kind of propaganda that recognizes defeat as victory makes the people of Chongqing unable to recognize the greatness of the Japanese army's operations and the uniqueness of its achievements. Therefore, they hold the belief that Japan will be defeated by the United States. Due to the fabricated news and concealed defeats of the United States, not only do the people of Chongqing hesitate to move forward in the overall peace movement, but they also create the psychology of delusionally relying on the victory of Britain and the United States to recover lost territory. Under the blind infatuation of the general public, the anti-Japanese psychology cannot be eliminated. This is the third reason for the war of resistance.</p>
<p>In summary, we can see that the war of resistance is a problem of thought. If this kind of thought is not adjusted, and the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is revealed, it will not achieve the desired effect in the end. Not only that, but the overall peace that we expect will never be quickly realized due to the existence of Chongqing's anti-Japanese thought. The allied friend and veteran, Mr. Toho Yoshida, his remarks can very thoroughly understand the inner pain of the Chinese people. We have read his article "Japan's Cultural Policy toward China and the Chinese Intellectual Class" in the past. He said: "When the Chinese intellectual class is still very suspicious of Japan, persistently revealing the "Asia Prosperity Theory" and Japanese people wearing Chinese clothes, eating Chinese dishes, and shouting Sino-Japanese friendship will only make the Chinese intellectual class more wary of Japan." His calm words pointed out very thoroughly that if Japan does not adjust the pro-American thinking of the general Chinese public, it cannot expect too much efficiency in promoting Sino-Japanese joint cooperation in building a new East Asia. If we want to achieve overall peace, we must first let Chongqing abandon the policy of war of resistance. To make Chongqing not resist, the first thing is to solve the ideological problem of the people in Chongqing. We sincerely hope that our Chinese friend, Mr. Toho Yoshida, will publicly answer the first and second points of this article. As for the third point, we hope that Japan's propaganda can extend to Chongqing in order to correct the suspicious thoughts of the people in Chongqing.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Several Basic Conditions for Practicing the Sino-Japanese Alliance <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Chiping</p>
<p>China and Japan are like teeth connected, with political and cultural exchanges since ancient times. At this time of the Great East Asia War, a decisive moment for victory or defeat, a critical time for the survival of the Great East Asian nations, it goes without saying that the two countries should unite to jointly support the overall situation and jointly seek survival. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese alliance means to make the relationship between the two countries even closer, so that China's revival and strength can be realized more quickly. However, no matter how beautiful and pleasing the words in the treaty are, no matter how enthusiastic and impassioned the people are, this is just an ideal. To make it a reality, the following points must be examined:</p>
<p>Smoothing Communication in Language</p>
<p>Understanding each other's language serves as a weapon for cultural communication and a medium for mutual love and affection. If even the language is not understood, there is simply no way to achieve cultural exchange. If meanings cannot be conveyed to each other, emotional resonance will not be aroused. Therefore, understanding each other's language is a fundamental condition for thorough Sino-Japanese cooperation, so as to achieve the highest goal, as declared in the Great East Asia Conference, of jointly promoting the ancient cultures of the East.</p>
<p>Now, China and Japan have sadly mourned the deception they suffered in the past and have realized that they should love each other, unite, and act consistently against external forces. Therefore, smoothing communication in language is the most fundamental work for unity and affection. Furthermore, the enthusiastic research of the people of the two countries into each other's languages is indeed a necessary and highly commendable phenomenon. I think a Chinese person who can understand Japanese, or a Japanese person who can understand Chinese, will surely remove the erroneous concepts in their minds and appreciate the loveliness and respectability of China or Japan.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>Economic cooperation is originally a condition that allied countries should have. In the past, Great East Asia was occupied by the forces of Britain and the United States. Their economic aggression reduced the national economic rights of China to a state of decline and danger, causing economic panic throughout China, forcing China to pant and sweat, and gradually heading towards the end of destruction.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the allied powers, with their magnificent military power, have wiped out the evil forces of Britain and the United States in one fell swoop. East Asia has purely become East Asia for East Asians, and the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation that Japan hopes for and China hopes for has also gained the opportunity to be realized. China is an industrially backward country. All production technologies and production methods have not been thoroughly improved and still retain their primitive state. If economic prosperity and production development are desired, it is impossible to achieve overnight and it is essential to rely on the strength of others. The allied powers are advanced countries on par with Britain and the United States, and everything is worth China's emulation. They are indeed a powerful partner for China to revive its economy.</p>
<p>China's Self-Strengthening</p>
<p>China has been liberated from the oppression of Britain and the United States because of the Great East Asia War. Furthermore, due to the spirit of righteousness of the allied powers, it has gained the opportunity to establish itself autonomously. China should take advantage of the current good opportunity to eliminate old habits and strive for self-strengthening to create a new life, so as not to disappoint the ardent expectations of the allied powers. Moreover, since the National Government announced its participation in the war on January 9, it has officially declared war on Britain and the United States, becoming a member of the effort to win the Great East Asia War. We must not just shout slogans, but should use strength as a weapon of war.</p>
<p>The Awakening of Chongqing</p>
<p>The entire East Asia has reached the stage of liberation. Only Chongqing is still being confused by Britain and the United States, acting as a traitor to East Asia, and cannot jointly build Great East Asia. This is truly the most regrettable and regrettable thing.</p>
<p>What are the compatriots in Chongqing gnawing on grass roots and tree bark for? What is the price of their sacrifice? They are also the people of our Republic of China. After hearing about the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, they must realize that Chongqing's resistance is futile, and that the establishment of the Sino-Japanese alliance will be a guarantee for China's revival. The call for Chongqing's resistance will no longer be able to bind the hearts of the people who have already awakened. It is hoped that Chongqing will awaken as soon as possible, no longer be intoxicated by the confusion of Britain and the United States, and jointly build the ideal Great East Asia and strive for the final victory of Great East Asia.</p>

<p>Navy</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Origin of Filming the Movie "Navy" <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the Great East Asia War, the brilliant achievements of the Japanese Navy have been the result of the unwavering belief forged by generations of Japanese naval predecessors, as well as the product of continuous and intense training. The spirit of utter devotion represented by the special attack units is especially worthy of emulation by future generations, and the magnificence of their actions can be said to be unmatched in the world. It is truly the pinnacle of the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy!</p>
<p>Today, at a time when the world is undergoing a major historical transformation with Japan as the axis, it is necessary to make people correctly understand the navy. Therefore, Mr. Iwata Takao devoted his passion to writing the book "Navy" for the Asahi Shimbun, which was disclosed in the newspaper day by day, concretizing the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, enabling the Japanese people to understand the characteristics of the navy, and making it a work that conforms to the times. Therefore, Shochiku Kinema has adapted it into a movie to contribute to the people. The production of this film was a massive project, and fortunately it was completed with the assistance of various naval organizations. The list of items used is attached.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Synopsis of the Plot <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>In the third year of Bunkyu (1863), six British warships arrived at Kagoshima. This was ostensibly to use the Namamugi Incident as an excuse to intimidate Japan and force it to submit. The Satsuma clan was greatly angered and rose up in arms, firing the first shot against the British barbarians. This is known as the Anglo-Satsuma War. Among the young warriors who served in this war, many later became famous generals. Marshal Togo also first faced battle in this war, at the age of only seventeen, and the belief that "those who come from the sea must be guarded against at sea" became even more firm. Tani Makoto was born in Kagoshima. In the summer of Showa 9 (1934), when Makoto was in the third grade of middle school, a survey of academic aspirations was held. It was difficult for him to decide for a while. After being led by Instructor Kikuchi to visit Etajima Naval Academy, Makoto decided to study the navy, and Makoto's long-held aspirations were finally realized. When he entered the school, he was deeply moved by Major Hirata's speech: "Your lives have already been dedicated to His Majesty the Emperor at this school!" From then on, he began a life of intense training and strict discipline.</p>
<p>A soldier's duty is to be loyal and virtuous. A soldier should be upright in etiquette. A soldier should be trustworthy. A soldier must maintain integrity. These are the things that Makoto recited every morning and evening.</p>
<p>Are you not true to your sincerity? Are you not consistent in your words and actions? Do you not lack vigor? Are you not shaken by effort? Do you not exhaust your spirit?</p>
<p>This is the essence of the military spirit, the backbone of the "Navy Soul." Makoto often urged himself not to fail this life. "Because of my temporary negligence as a junior officer, His Majesty's ship was sunk and the lives of my subordinates were lost. I am truly guilty and inexcusable. However, before dying together, the crew remained loyal to their duties and calmly responded. We are sacrificing our lives for the country and have no regrets. We only regret that people in the world may misunderstand this matter, causing a major blow to the development of submarines. Therefore, I hope that you will know more about encouragement, do not misunderstand, and devote all your efforts to researching and developing submarines. Then we, though dead, will have no regrets." After reading Commander Sakuma's will, Major Hirata wept and said, "Even if you silently understand the principles of submarines, it is still useless. Only those who read Commander Sakuma's will and weep every time can understand the way a naval soldier serves the country—"</p>
<p>Later, he devoted himself to practicing special submarines and had gained quite a bit of experience. He received secret orders, and at this time he happened to be returning home, saying goodbye to his old mother, brother, and sister, and returning to his hometown of Kagoshima.</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy's warship secretly set sail into the Pacific Ocean at midnight. It was several days before December 8, Showa 16 (1941).</p>
<p>"At this time of national crisis for our Imperial Nation, I am honored to have a place to die. I sincerely and faithfully pray for the eternal life of His Majesty the Emperor..." Makoto drafted a will in the officers' room.</p>
<p>The commander of the Combined Fleet raised the Z flag, and the brave warriors with soaring ambitions set off in special submarines to launch a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>At this time, friendly air force units also began a fierce attack, and special submarines strongly attacked the enemy's main forces. The shadow of the battleship USS Arizona suddenly appeared in the periscope. Makoto smiled unconsciously and sank the ship with a torpedo that was sure to hit. "Our surprise attack has succeeded!"</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the Imperial Nation depend on this battle. Each member must shatter their bones and complete their mission!" After the mothership received this telegram, the whereabouts of the special submarines became unknown from then on. How heroic are the five special submarines that have not yet returned. "The road to ambition is exhausted, and if one goes, one will never return!" Yamamoto Isoroku</p>
<h3 id="e77">Slogans <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The special attack units that shook the world, may their heroic spirits live forever! The bright moon over Pearl Harbor; a torpedo leaves a white trail, a thunderous crash as if the sky is collapsing, and the warship sinks in an instant. Alas, the special attack units whose names are inscribed in history, their heroic姿 is as vivid as ever.</p>
<p>Dawn of December 8, Showa 16 (1941)</p>
<p>A great feat of the Japanese Navy that shook the world!</p>
<p>The Japanese Special Attack Unit formed by special submarines broke into the heavily guarded Pearl Harbor, either launching a strong attack on the enemy's main forces simultaneously with a certain air force unit, or resolutely carrying out a lone night attack, sinking the battleship USS Arizona and others, establishing real achievements and shocking the enemy fleet. The Japanese side lost 29 aircraft and 5 special submarines that did not return.</p>
<p>The heroic姿 of national heroes whose English names are immortal are now on the silver screen.</p>
