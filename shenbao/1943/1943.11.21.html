<h3 id="c1">星期代論　吉田東祐言論集序言 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 張一鵬</p>
<p>在蘇州民間，常常傳說一件小小的故事·我現在把他寫在下邊：</p>
<p>「有雙胞胎兄弟二人，身財面貌，一般無二，連自己家裹人亦辨不淸楚。九歲時候，父母俱亡，無所依靠，大的為張家抱養為兒，小的為李家收留為奴。等到二十多歲，大的豐衣足食，養得肥頭胖耳，小的衣單食寡，弄得面黃肌瘦。雖然兄弟二人心中，多在想念他的同胞，苦於沒法見面。有一天，小的聽了他朋友的指點，去張家訪尋哥哥，及到見面之後，各各大驚失色，心中多懷疑着我們是雙胞胎，爲什麽一肥一瘦，大的闖小的冒充，而且人多口雜，你一句我一句，把小的激怒起來，兩人扭做一團，打得頭破血流。正在難解難分之際，旁邊来了一位王先生，王先生是他們兄弟二人幼時常在一起的人，所以雖隔別了十年，還多認識他，爭着上前向他訴說。王先生不慌不忙，講了許多近情着理的話，把面貌的變動，心裏的誤會，全是環境造成，以及這回閱讀的起　由於自已的積憤，與夫外人的挑撥，一件一件，說得非常動聽。兄弟二人，恍然大悟，抱頭痛哭，大的把自己的衣食給他弟弟，小的亦到哥哥家裹幫他的忙，不到一個月，不但恢復了從前的面貌，遦加深了彼此的感情。」</p>
<p>爲什麽要把這故事嚕嚕囌癱的寫了一大段呢？因爲　覺到中日兩國近年來劇雙的遞　的經過，實在是這故事的放大。不要說是天生的同種同文，誰都不能否認，自從碧眼胡兒來給你一個對照，愈益證明了「身材相貌一般無二」與雙胞胎起初相同。到後來一個漸漸强盛，一個漸漸衰弱，因被環境沾染得改變了形狀，幾幾乎自己不認得自己，何况對方，以致漸離漸遠，漸隔漸陳，外人乘間傾軋，與雙胞胎的懷疑相同。及至種種誤會，積成無數惡感，突然碰到一起，把同種同文，抹放净盡，拼命向「同歸於盡』的死路上邁進，縱然兩方皆有「心所謂危」的志士，謀扶危救領的方法，終究不易自拔，像雙胞胎的互國相同。其所以弄到如此地步，豈非少了一個王先生的綠故嗎？</p>
<p>如今好了，王先生出現了，那就是交壇宿將吉田東祐先生。他能毅把握着現實，能彀　盧到將來，能殼平心靜氣，抑制盧　之陋見，能毅遠慮深課，斬斷無謂之葛藤。更可賣貴的，他能毅把兩國民族在內心的痛苦，披肝瀝胆，毫不隱譚的加以釋明。醫如醫生，不但是熟讀古方，並且洞澈病情，然後配給一張對症的良劑。所以每逢他的言論，在報章雜誌上宜布出來，閱讀的羣衆，無不嘆爲眞正可以代表全民眾要說而不敢說並且說不出的與倫。我可斷言，變胞胎兄弟，如果要恢復他的本來面目，述到共存共榮的目的，非趕快吃吉田先生的良劑不可。</p>
<p>申報巳將先生最近的言論，刋印小册子，一時風行海上，莫不人手一編了。現在又譯成日文重付凝梨，使友邦　心東亞大局的人急起推行，豈獨中日兩國之福？</p>

<p>南京二十日中央社電第二屆金國宣傳會議第二日，盟邦日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大仿演講，題爲『我等於決職階段中之壹務』，原文如左：</p>
<p>現在大東亞戰爭俠要到閘週年的時候·各方面的戰局正是由於敵人的總反攻，眼看着在展開着白热化的決戰塲面。當遺個時候，中日兩國在過去的十月三十日，締結了日本國及中華民國間的同盟條約，確立了劃期的中日新關係的基礎·而向大東亞的建設更進上一步。又在十一凡的五六兩日，在大東亞舉行了大東亞會議，這時候立在善鄰友好互助協力的　固的基礎上，向着達成共同目的坦途上溝進中的大東亞各國，均相會在電光爛漫的東京，關於完遂大東亞戰爭及建設大東亞的方針，施行了毫無隔膜的拹　。於是在六日那天，發表了印在大東亞的歷史上永久不磨的大東亞共同宣言，對擊破美英的貪而無厭的桎梏，及確保神賜給我們的自由獨立，與共存共榮的灌利，宜明了堂堂的方針。</p>
<p>國民政府爲滴應此等事態起見，此次召開全國宜傳會議。鄙人　着這個機會，能夠和諸位長官相　一堂，覺得非常光榮。現在對於諸位長官在宣傳各方面的種種協力與援助，表示深厚的謝意，同時還希望今後更加一層的親密和協助。現在把我個人對於現在時局的所儈陳　出來，誚諸位長官指教。第一要說的，就是犬東亞各國政治的性格·有了一個大的　進，這件事就是緬甸及菲律賓共和國的獨立，中日兩國同時確立，日泰兩國同盟的　適，以及印度臨時政府的崛起，這都是一個新的進展。各國的結合愈加堅固，各國所發出的熱意·便促成了大東亞會議的希望。結果關於完遂大東亞戰爭，及建設大東亞新秧序方針，意見完全一致，電新加强戰力，同心進成重大共同使命的快心。於是在十一月六日那天，向中外聲明了大東亞共同實言·這就是大東亞各國本着東亞共存共榮，自主獨立親和，發揮東亞交化經濟提携，繁榮世界進辰。遺五個綱領，互相提携，愈加增强了完遂大東亞戰爭，建設新大東亞·而謀在確立世界的和平上有所貢獻的決意，票明的言佈給世界了。於是夫東亞戰爭是破邪顯正的戰爭，是十億東亞民族大義名分的戰爭，這件事便顯明的宜明於中外了。也就是本着這樣明顯的戰爭目的，舉全力擊減共同的敵人美英。這正是合乎柏意在，使我降們生的這個天予的恩惠西面，而爲返遼本然的奢態所作的一個決戰。我們如果能　想到遺是將來爲了民眾在福祉之下，舉共存共榮之實的一個尊貴的準備。</p>
<p>大東亞各國·在這種牢固的信念之下給合以後，最後的勝利，必然是歸於我們而無疑的了。</p>
<p>必勝不敗的戰爭　勞以後，帝國又呼應着這個雄大的使命，和決戰的態勢。他那補　論遭過任何困難，都可以斷然的突破困難，搜得最後勝利的必腾信念，和那堅强的鬥志。於是和各種戰門部鬥的藍備，共同的鞏固着前進的步武，而反映在第一戰綫果的發揚上。下面把關於作關談一談：（未完）</p>

<p>— 白華</p>
<p>一九三九年九月，歐洲戰爭勃發後不久，英國政府會聲述預料戰爭將繼續三年，而樹立一切對策：之後；知道三年不夠、英國政府又把對策延長至五年。但現在沒有人可斷言戰爭將於五年結東吧！不、戰爭現在日經過了四年以上，其結束的徵兆依然未見，德國現在受到從三方面來的攻擊，但沒有人可說德國略有崩潰的危機吧！如在　次三國同　條約的紀念日巾所闡明，日德用極密切的組帶結合着，經過四年或五年的戰爭之後，如其說德國的歐洲要塞並　　搖，則囘隊日本又如何呢？</p>
<p>日本國力大增</p>
<p>我們敢大　的　，日本　有南方占領地的資源，其國力正在與日俱進中。說戰爭須五年的是誰？澳洲人在戰爭勃發的初期，對打倒希特勒，　素里尼表示非常的熱心，愛國熱情的浪潮，風處全澳，抓住全體人民的心〝靑年們進而加入軍隊，希望被泥遺至挨及，巴勒士坦，及其他中東各地。他們一面熱情洶湧，一面欣喜雀躍。但那是一九三九—四○年的事。時日如流……時間漸漸的使熱悄冷却了．現在是一九四三年、而且一九四三年將近告終了。當初視為　期戰，不加考慮地喜而參戰的情緒，完全拂除了。所剩的祇有恐怖，失望，　戰。歡洲及近東的戰局且不說，在太平洋，不，在演洲的上空，現正不斷地激戰着。現實的戰爭，以前以為是做夢，現在寬到了澳洲的頭上了。</p>
<p>採取善隣策</p>
<p>從地理上親來—那在政治的意義亦然—如澳洲那樣不是好戰的國民，恐怕沒有捲入太平洋戰爭的必要，然而戰爭終於來了為那戰爭業已繼續了四年以上，而且今後似乎還須繼績數年。所以五年後戰爭告終嗎？或戰爭將至何時結東呢？又假使那時候，發生那事件，則戰爭又將如何呢？我們如揣想這些講論，是無意義的。單是「坐着安樂椅子作戰」，一點也沒有用處。一個國民和另一個國民（至少在表面上）·雖在作激烈的戰爭時，那個國民採取根本的「善憐政策」，正是極可　慕的事。為了要在戰後克服因長期問的戰爭而發生的國民間之激悄與敵意，唯有靠各人心底上對於這種純情的同悄與諒解（戰爭—歐洲和東亞的二處戰事—將繼續數年吧！我們對於諸位的這推測，亦且同感。但想那些事有何用？戰爭的結東，不外是時的解決。如其說時會給我們教訓，則我們可以這樣說：第一，我們的生涯，消耗在血的浴塘中；造成相亙的毀滅、極為短促。第二，戰爭無論繼續至多久，又無論如何猛烈，交戰團民之間相亙的友情精神，斷不完全消滅。</p>

<p>斯丹埠二十日中央社電　記者塞特爾所稱關於土耳其並不採取秘密政策，而其政策係以國民為基礎之論調，土議員沙達對此利見解加以駁斥謂，倘應告知民眾以曼奈門卓格　外長開羅之行之結果·荀政府及人民蘇以為有此必要，則共會議之舉行不應閉門密議，倘以人民黨敢近對開羅會議之辯論，較之英首指訪間亞達那之辯論更為激烈，則屬錯誤，土國政府仍繼續保持對友邦之　務。著名記者耶爾門在華登報表示擊決反對土耳其參戰、謂於為獨立而戰之戰門中，土耳其應表示共勇氣，在半世紀以前，曾盛行之意見，以為無土耳其之參戰則無戰事，而今日可以申明者，土耳共不再感到須要作戰，因防禦及生存之戰事與朱受攻擊而進行戰事右所不同，且土耳其如參加作戰，其招失必大，而士國未能達到工業國之程度，故未能獨立作戰，但對於重組世界之問題，士耳共則佔有重要之地位。</p>

<p>「在兩租界收回後各位還是第一屆受訓的模範警察，至於警察的服務信條，應絕對遵照全國警察訓條努力服務，上海是中國的大都市，也就是世界有名的大都市。但是實質上各大都市的長處在上梅全無，而各大都市的壞處，在上海可說到處可見，故對訓練教育警察·尤為重要，因警察能發揮本身的力量，掃除社會的壞處，我們要悄除壞處，維持治安，改善社會道德，務求社會進步，就得先從自已做去，倘沒有根本決心，良好觀念，非但上海，就是自已的道德也得下沉。在三十年前我在求學時代，對於一般社會政府官員，感到不滿意，現在自已已為官員，却更不滿意，可是要人家好、沒有把握，要自己好，是有把握，何况警察可以發揮警察力量，警察的權威·負責職務，維持治安，指導民眾·培養道德，使社會日趨進步，先決條件先要自已好，才得人家不得不好，所以我們要訓練培養模范警察，來掃除大都會巾的壞處，而為民眾模範6過去警察三種現已合併，而對全上海警察統一問題，吾人無日不在研究改善巾，現在我們要認淸自已的責任，下一個服務社會的觀念，發揮警察力量，改善社會治安道德，我寄以萬分希望」。</p>

<p>本市各界居民，因受百物　漲影響，生活日見艱難。依據昨日報戰，全市各公司商店醫樂已議見黯淡；除日用必需品尚有添辦者外，高貴與奢侈品等，顯然鮮人問津，並聞當屬對於市民生活，頗寄予密切關懷，或將設法澈底改善。</p>
<p>人民在戰時廣其艱苦的生活，本來是勢所必然的，我們大家都覺不怨天，不尤人，祇是艱苦的生活中，亦未嘗不能護得改善之道，例如，在食糧或燃料貧乏之時，即當澈底改善其供應問題，務使一般民眾之生活艱苦狀態，不至於渝到絕糧與斷炊的地步；又如，在最大多數人終日掙扎於最低生活水準下的一個環境中，同時竟仍有驕着淫逸，肆情揮審的一個生活狀態之存在，徒使戰時人民生活呈現一種不可思議的矛盾：一方面，最少數的度着優裕生活老，終日徵逐於酒食，追求於勝利，於是奢侈之風，愈不能泯，貪婪之念，愈趨愈熾；另一方面，最多數的度着困的生活者，購買力竟由薄弱以等於零。須知最少數人民購買力的增强，與最大多數人民購買力的銳减，都足以影饗於生產界的供應開題，因為前者足使生產界消耗其人力，對力，物力，於不需要之生產，如一切奢侈品類，後者足使正常需要之生產，無由發揮，即令發揮亦要形成過剩狀態，同樣不是生產界之福。所以，我們認為改善的途徑，不外於一方面竭力提高薪水階級之待過，一方面銳意减少一切不必要之消耗。</p>

<p>組織與維持</p>
<p>中國救濟婦孺總會的組織，最上層是意事會。董事會下面股有留養院院長（正趙晋唧，副朱子奎），院長以下負責全院實隊事務的主任，男院方面，總務主任爲瞿佐庭，管理兼教養主任爲滯少楚。職工人數三十一人。女院綜理總務　教各務的主任是陳石全琳，另有事務，督藥刻　各主任導師，教職員共十一人，男女工役共六人。由於會的經費異常困難，職工的待遇都淸苦得出乎意外。除主任的期津在三百元以上之外，一般職員教員的月薪都不足二百元，不僅不足以　養家屬，即以洪個人日常　用亦萬萬不夠。名義上供給膳宿，然而與道般苦難婦孺一棧。不得不常常挨餓挨　，還得挨病呢。工作却是非常艱重，據張惠元先生說，因爲會裹經費不足，睛不起足夠的教師，以前所聘各級教師，　因忍受不了生活水準綫以下的待過和過分的忙而先後他去，以致留下的教師只有他本人和另外一位，以道兩位教師來教男院一百四十八名向來缺乏教養的流浪　宜，憑你有三頭六　九張嘴，也有難望濟事之苦何况，除了教導事務之外，道兩位教師遺得在院內兼施充工役，在會外兼作交際呢。眞的，在『教救孩子」的口號之外，尚須高喊：「救救教師』了。幼秈間的教　員，人數雖然較多，可是職務也很繁重，除了展有一位女　，一切保姆所應做的事務也都派在她們身上的。女院十一位教職員，一樣淸苦，不過因爲分工合作，和衷共濟，大家抱着犧牲服務的決心，也不再　苔了。</p>
<p>中國救濟婦孺總會三個院的經費，一向只靠中外普士的捐助，没有基金與固定的收入。戰後社會情形改戰，捐款來源不絕如　，食糧方面。從前因有美國紅十字會捐助的小廖與　粉·尚可維持五百餘人的生活，可惜早巳用　，現在只靠　口米粉，實際上不足甚鉅，雖然購買極劣的雜糧以爲稱助，其贊用也頗可驚人，共他衣著教靑醫藥费用，幾乎全部沒有着落。「天天過年夜』，在普通家庭巳是危險，何况一個規模巨大的善國繼。</p>

<h3 id="c58">砂糖黑市的由來 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 馬鈞文</p>
<p>敝地太倉，閱四日本增刊載的紙烟黑市的由來，而感到我業中的砂糖也有着同樣的病態。砂糖自今秋起，由松太區的糖業公會配給，也分甲乙丙了四級，配給量同樣的爲一二四八制。自開始以來，至最近共配給二次，而其數量，甲級不過三百多斤，而第二次爲三百斤尚不足，丁級則始移祗有三五十斤，配給價爲十元稍不足，而規定合法潤利，爲同樣的百分之二十，則甲級不過七八百元，丁級則一百元不足，且除去每月之常務等，則所餘有幾。</p>
<p>南貨店之售糖，在戰卽一般持有赤砂糖者，視爲珍　，竭力將其價格抬　，竟有較配給價高出十倍有餘，而一般之產婦。因必欲需要之故，不得不出十餘倍之價格。</p>
<p>故鄙意以爲當局之取締黑市，固屬須要，但一方面應將配給量增多，務使人民之能維持最低需要，而孕姙糖，（孕婦所需之糖）孕婦得可持居住瞪向商號申請配給，由商號轉向糖業公會申諦，而應得適量之配給，而供孕婦之需要，遺棧常局再加以服厲的禁止黑市，而各商號即巳能供人民之需要，而不必冒險去做　市，則黑市可自減矣。</p>

<p>近月以來。無分貧富，家家日不可缺的燃料——柴，售價步步飛漒，漫無止境，而本市大部份住民所用柴的代用品——煤球，尤感供不應求。一期果因時届初冬，消耗量比較其他各季更多，而煤球原料之煤屑配給量的減少，是其最大的原因，這是無庸　言的。處於今日決戰體制下的我們，當然應該萬分的體諒當局配給重要物資的艱難，在燃用時應該特別的節省，以抵消配給量的缺數。但是，事實上我們這輩薪水階級的小市民，爲了購買煤球時的種種困難，及黑市價格的無力購買，使我們用煤球時都自動的格外節約，普通之家，皆巳取消煮食早餐，而向食物難購買大餠等代以果腹，及下午晚餐煮热，即將煤球燼火息影。親友中談及挆用此法者。有限，但聚沙成塔，對於補救煤　缺乏之現狀，不無小補也。然則這種消極的辦法，祗能行之於暫時，如今嚴寒巳　不寬容的降臨了，我們必須用積極的有效方法，去對付目前足民生。</p>
<p>本報北平通訊中曾載：北平當局有鑒於煤爲戰時重要物資，爲求節省普通一般之消耗計，因有全北平市分區輪流斷電一刻錄之舉。本市有關當局，不妨研究而仿效試行之。假定全市分作若干區、各區於每星期中所規定日子之晚上十時正起，實行停止供給電流一刻鏡，處於決戰體制下之今日行之，其節約之意義尤爲重大，市民於　成習慣後，決不會有感覺不便利者；反正，現在是非常時期，我們總得熬一熬。而因此所省得之煤斤必甚可戮，以之補足煤球原料配給量之缺額，必有餘裕也。</p>
<p>末後，祈望當局對於煤屑之配給量：能逐期增加，以免市民陷於凍餒之境；而煤球限價的嚴格執行，尤爲我輩小市民所時刻關懷者也。</p>

        <h1>1943.11.21</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Weekly Commentary: Preface to a Collection of Essays by Tosuke Yoshida <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>In Suzhou, there is a small story often told among the common people. I will write it down below:</p>
<p>"There were twin brothers, identical in appearance and wealth, so much so that even their own family members couldn't tell them apart. When they were nine years old, both parents died, leaving them without support. The elder brother was adopted by the Zhang family, and the younger brother was taken in by the Li family as a servant. When they reached their twenties, the elder brother lived in abundance and grew fat and well-fed, while the younger brother was poorly clothed and meagerly fed, becoming thin and pale. Although both brothers often thought of their sibling, they had no way to meet. One day, the younger brother, guided by a friend, went to the Zhang family to find his elder brother. Upon meeting, they were both greatly surprised, suspecting in their hearts that they were twins. However, due to the difference in their appearances, one fat and one thin, the elder brother suspected the younger brother of impersonating him, and with many people talking at once, the younger brother became enraged. The two wrestled together, fighting until they were bloody and battered. Just as they were in a deadlock, a Mr. Wang came along. Mr. Wang had been with the brothers since childhood, so even after ten years of separation, he still recognized them. They rushed forward to tell him their stories. Mr. Wang, without慌张, spoke many reasonable and empathetic words, explaining that the changes in their appearances and the misunderstandings in their hearts were all caused by their environments. He also explained the cause of their present conflict, stemming from their own accumulated resentments and the instigation of outsiders, explaining everything very convincingly. The two brothers suddenly understood, embraced each other, and wept bitterly. The elder brother shared his food and clothing with his younger brother, and the younger brother helped his elder brother with his work. In less than a month, they not only regained their former appearances but also deepened their affection for each other."</p>
<p>Why did I write this long and tedious story? Because I feel that the dramatic changes between China and Japan in recent years are essentially an amplified version of this story. No one can deny that they are inherently of the same race and share the same culture, especially when compared to those blue-eyed barbarians, further proving that they were initially "identical in appearance," just like twins. Later, one gradually became stronger, and the other gradually weakened, becoming so shaped and altered by their environments that they almost didn't recognize themselves, let alone each other. As a result, they gradually drifted apart, became estranged, and outsiders seized the opportunity to sow discord, similar to the twins' suspicion of each other. Eventually, various misunderstandings accumulated into countless resentments, and when they suddenly collided, they completely erased their shared race and culture, desperately moving towards a dead end of "mutual destruction." Even if both sides had patriots who "felt the danger" and sought ways to save the situation, it was difficult to break free, just like the twins fighting each other. Isn't it because they lacked a Mr. Wang that they ended up in such a state?</p>
<p>Now, thankfully, Mr. Wang has appeared, and that is the veteran diplomat, Mr. Tosuke Yoshida. He can firmly grasp reality, foresee the future, maintain a calm and peaceful mind, suppress narrow-minded prejudices, and thoughtfully plan far ahead, cutting off unnecessary entanglements. Even more valuable, he can candidly and frankly explain the inner pain of the two nations. Like a doctor, he not only knows the ancient formulas but also thoroughly understands the patient's condition before prescribing a suitable remedy. Therefore, whenever his opinions are published in newspapers and magazines, the reading public cannot help but sigh that they truly represent what the entire population wants to say but dares not or cannot. I can confidently say that if the estranged twin brothers want to restore their original appearances and achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity, they must quickly take Mr. Yoshida's remedy.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao has already published Mr. Yoshida's recent speeches in a booklet, which has become popular in Shanghai, with everyone having a copy. Now, it is being translated into Japanese and reprinted, so that those in friendly nations who care about the overall situation in East Asia will urgently promote it. Is this not a blessing for China and Japan alone?</p>
<h3 id="e2">Propaganda Conference Opens Yesterday, Chairman Wang Attends and Delivers Instructions, Japanese Reporting Minister Matsushima Attends and Gives Speech <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - To review the past, plan for the future, and strengthen wartime propaganda efforts, the Propaganda Department of the National Government convened the Second National Propaganda Conference in Nanjing on the 20th. At 8 a.m., all attending representatives and observers, led by Conference Chairman Lin Baisheng, went to Luyuan to pay respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The opening ceremony of the conference was solemnly held in the hall. After everyone stood, they sang the National Anthem and paid their respects to the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen (three bows). After the ceremony, they respectfully listened to the instructions for propaganda workers. After the instructions, the ceremony concluded. Afterwards, everyone took a group photo outside the mausoleum and then returned to the conference venue (the Sino-German Cultural Association). At 10 a.m., the first plenary session began. After everyone took their seats, Chairman Lin delivered a brief opening speech, stating that according to the conference charter, there would be one or two vice-chairmen. It had been decided that Guo Ziming, Vice Minister of Propaganda, and Guan Yixian, Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, would serve in these roles. Chairman Lin further explained that similar proposals from various parties would be consolidated for review and that the proposals would be divided into four groups: propaganda, administration, propaganda guidance, general propaganda affairs, and special propaganda affairs. Each group would hold a small organizational review meeting. The conveners and reviewers for each group were also unanimously approved by the conference. At 11 a.m., the Chairman arrived to deliver instructions, and everyone stood to attention. The Chairman provided earnest guidance on the current propaganda policy, methods, and key points. At 12 noon, Naval Reporting Minister Matsushima gave a speech on the recent situation of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of the Greater East Asia nations.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Chairman's Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - On the first day of the Second National Propaganda Conference, the Chairman attended and delivered a speech. The main points are summarized as follows: The current time has entered a new stage, and the Second National Propaganda Conference is being held at this juncture, which is of epoch-making significance for future propaganda policies and methods. The mission is extremely important and significant. Finally, he instructed the propaganda workers on the direction of their future efforts and encouraged all attending representatives to move forward in this direction.</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Matsushima</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - On the second day of the Second National Propaganda Conference, Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet in China gave a speech titled "Our Duties in the Decisive Stage," the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Now that the Greater East Asia War is about to reach its first anniversary, the battles on all fronts are unfolding in a white-hot decisive battle due to the enemy's general counteroffensive. At this time, China and Japan, on October 30th, concluded the Treaty of Alliance between Japan and the Republic of China, establishing the foundation for a landmark new relationship between China and Japan, and taking another step towards the construction of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, on November 5th and 6th, the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo. At this time, the countries of Greater East Asia, progressing on the path to achieving common goals based on the solid foundation of good neighborliness, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, all gathered in Tokyo, where electric lights blazed, and conducted seamless discussions on completing the Greater East Asia War and constructing Greater East Asia. On the 6th, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which will be permanently engraved in the history of Greater East Asia, was issued, declaring the grand policy of smashing the insatiable shackles of the United States and Britain, securing the freedom and independence bestowed upon us by the gods, and the benefits of coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>The National Government, in response to these circumstances, has convened this National Propaganda Conference. I am honored to have the opportunity to gather with all of you officials. I would like to express my deep gratitude to all of you officials for your various collaborations and assistance in propaganda, and I hope for even closer cooperation and assistance in the future. Now, I will present my personal views on the current situation for your guidance. The first thing to say is that the political character of the countries of Greater East Asia has undergone a major advancement. This is the independence of the Republic of Burma and the Republic of the Philippines, the simultaneous establishment of the relationship between China and Japan, the formal conclusion of the alliance between Japan and Thailand, and the rise of the Provisional Government of India. All of these are new developments. The bonds between the countries have become stronger, and the enthusiasm of each country has promoted the hope of the Greater East Asia Conference. As a result, opinions were completely unified on completing the Greater East Asia War and constructing a new Greater East Asia order, strengthening war capabilities, and advancing towards the accomplishment of major common missions with one heart. On November 6th, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was announced to the world, stating that the countries of Greater East Asia, based on the five principles of co-existence and co-prosperity in East Asia, independent autonomy and amity, promotion of East Asian culture, economic cooperation, and global prosperity, will cooperate with each other to further enhance the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War, build a new Greater East Asia, and contribute to the establishment of world peace. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is a war to destroy evil and reveal righteousness, a war of great justice for the one billion people of East Asia, and this has been clearly declared to the world. With this clear war aim, we will exert all our efforts to eliminate our common enemies, the United States and Britain. This is exactly what heaven intends, to make us return to the natural state of the blessings bestowed upon us, and a decisive battle for the extravagance of reversing the natural state. If we can think of this as a noble preparation for the realization of coexistence and co-prosperity under the well-being of the people in the future...</p>
<p>After the countries of Greater East Asia unite under this firm belief, the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us.</p>
<p>After the inevitable victory, the Empire is responding to this grand mission with a decisive attitude. It has an unbreakable belief in achieving final victory, no matter what difficulties it encounters, and a strong fighting spirit. Therefore, it is jointly consolidating the steps forward with various battle departments, reflecting the development of the front line. Below, I will talk about the customs... (To be continued)</p>
<p>Welcoming Banquet for All Representatives</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Second National Propaganda Conference solemnly opened in Nanjing yesterday (20th) morning, with over a hundred representatives from various regions attending, marking an unprecedented event. That evening at 7 p.m., the Propaganda Department specially hosted a banquet at the Sino-German Cultural Association to entertain the attending and observing representatives. Furthermore, at 8:30 p.m. on the same day, a welcoming concert was held at the conference venue, with the Guangdong Music Association performing national music, creating a highly enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Key Points of a Broadcast by Guan Yixian, Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, on North China under the Decisive Battle System <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Since the National Government joined the war, the entire country, under the guidance of the highest national policy, has entered the stage of decisive battle. Under the leadership of Chairman Jiang and the instructions of successive chairmen of the Political Affairs Commission, officials and civilians in North China alike recognize the importance of their mission and bear the historical responsibility of a king-producing place.</p>
<p>Regarding political affairs, they are actively engaged in construction work, rectifying officialdom, and establishing clean governance. They are also closely linked with the New People's Society, jointly implementing the "Three Cleansing Movement." The so-called three cleansings are "clean politics, clean countryside, and..." (讳 - avoid mentioning/taboo). Starting on August 9th of this year, they implemented the first phase of the initiative to promote new construction in North China, which successfully concluded on October 31st. At the same time, they are actively guiding the practice of the New People's Movement, completing national organization, and prescribing the following four items as the guidelines for the second half of this year: eradicating communism and building the nation, increasing production and saving the people, correcting thought, and reforming new customs. They are also reorganizing all North China youth, with the number now exceeding one million.</p>
<p>Regarding economic affairs, all major commodities are subject to rational control. Fair prices are set for various goods. Since the announcement of emergency price countermeasures in June of last year, merchants have generally known to abide by the law. Food authorities are also working hard to strengthen their institutions and strive for collection, distribution, and other tasks. To ensure that the use of private capital in North China is aligned with the war effort, the authorities have devised the following measures: 1. Inducing scattered private capital into the control circle. 2. Suppressing high-interest loans. 3. Reducing speculative activities.</p>
<p>Regarding security, after the implementation of five security enhancement campaigns, security in various regions has gradually recovered. The entire city of North China has also launched a military sweep to suppress communist bandits since mid-September, under the sincere unity and close cooperation of Japanese and Chinese officials and civilians. In less than two months, significant results have been achieved.</p>
<p>Regarding cultural affairs, people in the North China cultural community have spontaneously established organizations to engage in new cultural activities. The better-established cultural organizations in Beijing include the Chinese New Culture Construction Association, the Chinese Living Culture Association, and the Chinese Culture Society, which promote comprehensive cultural construction. Those focused on literature and art include the North China Writers Association. In Tianjin, in addition to branches of the above-mentioned associations, there is also the Japan-China Spiritual Culture Association. Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, and other places have also formed cultural alliances and cultural associations.</p>
<p>Regarding propaganda, the Political Affairs Commission has a specialized agency responsible for propaganda and reporting, the Intelligence Bureau under the General Affairs Department. Each province and city has a propaganda office, and each county has a propaganda room. For propaganda and reporting on the suppression of bandits, a reporting section has been established in the General Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression Committee. There is also the "North China Propaganda Alliance," whose basic members include the North China News Association, the North China Broadcasting Association, the North China Film Company, and the North China News Material Association. Its affiliated members include the North China Opera Association, the North China Reporting Art Association, the North China Commercial and Industrial Propaganda Association, and the Chinese Journalists Association.</p>
<p>Regarding education, education in North China follows the central policy and is guided and promoted by the North China Education General Office. Peking University has established six colleges: arts, science, law, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, with over three thousand male and female students. The Normal University is a combination of the former male and female normal colleges and is a higher education institution for training teachers, with over one thousand male and female students. There is also a teacher training center, which is a re-education institution for secondary school teachers, with a six-month term and a five-year history. Shandong University is under preparation, and the number of children receiving education has fully recovered to previous levels.</p>
<p>Regarding construction, the construction of railways and highways, river and water conservancy projects, and the repair of cultural relics and civil engineering projects are all being advanced step by step according to the planned schedule. The railways have added the Shide and Tongpu trunk lines, and the Shida line (formerly the Zhengda Road) has been widened.</p>
<p>Finally, let me talk about the joint conference of the New People's Society. The full joint conference of the New People's Society in the 32nd year was held grandly in Beijing on the 26th of last month and successfully concluded on the 30th.</p>

<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German military sources stated last night: German forces occupied Zhitomir yesterday, which is located 150 kilometers west of Kyiv, capturing large quantities of war materiel. Many tanks and mortars were captured. The number of enemy troops captured was extremely large.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 19th: German forces in the Zhitomir area destroyed 320 Soviet tanks, 450 cannons, and many infantry weapons in the past nine days. General cleaning forces have buried over 10,000 Soviet soldiers' bodies. To date, over 2,500 Soviet prisoners of war have been identified in the area.</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (Central News Agency) - Moscow announced last night: Due to heavy German pressure, Soviet forces have withdrawn from Zhitomir. Last Sunday, Soviet forces announced the occupation of the city. Two days before that, Soviet intelligence agencies mentioned setbacks in the Zhitomir and Korosten areas for the first time in a four-month offensive, due to a large-scale counteroffensive by German forces under the command of Marshal von Manstein.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (German News Agency) - When Soviet forces began their pincer movement at Zhitomir, German command did not launch a counteroffensive as broad as the Soviet commanders had expected. This was a miscalculation on the Soviet side and became the precursor to the German victory. The battles of Zhitomir and Korosten were part of a campaign that the Soviet forces had been trying to achieve since July of this year. The German forces, with a fierce counteroffensive, inflicted the first blow on the Soviet plan to sweep the German front. To the west of Kyiv, Soviet forces with a strong army, advancing from the south, proceeded towards Zhitomir to the south and Korosten to the north, in a pincer movement to occupy the area between the two cities. When the flanks were threatened this time, the German forces changed their usual elastic retreat strategy. Only parts of the German army that fell within the jaws of the Soviet pincer movement retreated. German forces in surrounding positions held their original ground and attacked the flanks of the Soviet forces advancing in the south. This led to the recapture of Zhitomir. The battle is still developing. Its development north of Korosten will have repercussions, but the front line is now increasingly muddy.</p>

Units starting from Bin County advanced from north of Lijin along the north bank of the old Yellow River towards the communist forces in the Qinghe Military District. On the other hand, Japanese units advancing from Gaohua, Bo, and Guangrao attacked the headquarters and subordinate units of the Qinghe Military Command to the west and southwest of Lijin from midnight on the 17th. Other units crossed the Xiaoqing River from Liujiaogou and advanced northwest to attack the enemy's flanks.

<p>Beiping, 20th (Central News Agency) - After assuming office, Mr. Wang Yintai, Director of General Affairs of the North China Political Affairs Commission, met with a group of reporters for the first time on the 19th. He answered reporters' questions on various political and economic issues in North China as follows: (Interruption) What new policies are there regarding the food shortage problem? (Answer) I deeply regret that we have not achieved the expected results. However, we are now using past experiences to study new policies. North China has never been self-sufficient in food, but I feel that this can certainly be achieved through a substantial increase in production. (Interruption) What are the countermeasures to develop resources and enhance combat power? (Answer) Regarding this issue, the Ministry of Industry had already discussed such countermeasures before the current restructuring of the Political Affairs Commission. Promoting resource development is based on solving the food problem as a prerequisite. The authorities are determined to invest heavily in increasing food production and stabilizing prices. We will continue to actively pursue this direction in the future. Regarding the development of important resources, I believe North China still has unlimited potential for development. For example, North China's coal reserves are not only countless in type and quantity, but also largely undeveloped. Therefore, we are determined to carry out development with meticulous planning. Furthermore, regarding cotton, American cotton, Indian cotton, and Egyptian cotton have all been tested and are suitable for cultivation, and increased production can be expected. Other items such as wool, oils, and leather have also had their control mechanisms established, and work has already begun. Therefore, future production and distribution should quickly become smoother.</p>

<p>Beijing, 20th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Du Xijun, Supervisor of the General Administration of the North China Political Affairs Commission and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Pacification Army, announced on the 19th the comprehensive battle achievements of the Pacification Army in the four years since its establishment. He also made the following remarks on the mission of the Pacification Army in suppressing the communists: In addition to having the characteristics of the National Army, the mission of suppressing communists in the anti-communist war is becoming even more important. Currently, we are focusing on three points: reforming personnel, rectifying military discipline, and winning the hearts of the people. We are working with the Japanese army to advance towards the completion of an ironclad anti-communist defense. The autonomy and active anti-communist stance of the Pacification Army are gradually progressing. The battle achievements of the Pacification Army will certainly increase in the future, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Wartime Good Neighborliness <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>In September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of the European war, the British government predicted that the war would continue for three years and established all countermeasures accordingly. Afterwards, knowing that three years would not be enough, the British government extended the countermeasures to five years. But now no one can say that the war will end in five years! No, the war has now lasted for more than four years, and there are still no signs of its end. Germany is now under attack from three sides, but no one can say that Germany is even slightly on the verge of collapse! As clarified in the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact, Japan and Germany are connected by extremely close ties. After four or five years of war, if it is said that Germany's European fortress is not wavering, then what about Japan?</p>
<p>Japan's National Power Greatly Increased</p>
<p>We dare to say boldly that Japan, with the resources of the occupied southern territories, is growing stronger day by day. Who said the war would take five years? At the beginning of the war, the Australians were very enthusiastic about defeating Hitler and Mussolini. The tide of patriotic enthusiasm swept across Australia, capturing the hearts of all the people. Young people went on to join the army, hoping to be sent to Egypt, Palestine, and other places in the Middle East. They were excited and overjoyed. But that was in 1939-40. Time flies... time is gradually cooling the heat. It is now 1943, and 1943 is coming to an end. The sentiment of gladly participating in the war without considering it a long-term war has been completely swept away. All that remains is terror, disappointment, and war weariness. Not to mention the war situation in Australia and the Near East, fierce battles are now constantly raging in the Pacific, no, in the skies above Australia. The real war, which was previously thought to be a dream, is now looming over Australia.</p>
<p>Adopting a Good Neighbor Policy</p>
<p>Geographically speaking—and this is also true in a political sense—a nation like Australia that is not warlike probably had no need to get involved in the Pacific War. However, war has finally come, and that war has continued for more than four years, and it seems that it will have to continue for several years to come. So, will the war end in five years? Or when will the war end? And what will happen if that event occurs at that time? It is meaningless for us to imagine these arguments. Simply "fighting the war from an easy chair" is of no use. It is extremely admirable when one nation adopts a fundamental "good neighbor policy" towards another nation (at least on the surface) even while they are engaged in a fierce war. In order to overcome the excitement and hostility between nations caused by a long war, one can only rely on the pure sympathy and understanding in everyone's heart (the war—the two wars in Europe and East Asia—will continue for several years! We also share your guess. But what's the use of thinking about those things? The end of the war is nothing more than a matter of time. If time will teach us a lesson, then we can say this: First, our lives are consumed in a pool of blood; causing mutual destruction is extremely brief. Second, no matter how long the war continues, and no matter how fierce it is, the spirit of mutual friendship between the warring nations will never be completely extinguished.</p>

After a decision is made in the near future, formal distribution can begin. It is expected that the implementation of cotton yarn and cloth distribution will not only have a great impact on the purchase of materials, but also on all other economic revitalization.</p>

<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 19th: On the 18th, German troops occupied three islands in the Aegean Sea, including Patmos, and guarded them without bloodshed. At noon on the same day, the Italian troops guarding Samos, Fourni, Ikaria, and the Patmos military also surrendered to the German Navy. German naval units also occupied Patmos and Lipsi, two islands north of Leros, and captured many prisoners. Currently, the British forces in the area are only holding Samos. The island, except for its proximity to the Turkish coast, has been cut off from the outside world.</p>

After several hours of combat, German forces finally contained the superior enemy forces. Although Thursday's battle was only a local one, it can be seen as a prelude to a large-scale offensive launched by the enemy's plan against the left flank of the German defenses.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a recent report in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, Yu Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the puppet regime, stated when meeting with foreign reporters that there would be no lasting peace in the world if the old order was adhered to in violation of human intentions, and criticized the world policies of Britain and the United States. The fact that Kong Xiangxi, a leading figure in the British and American faction, suddenly made this statement has puzzled many. He stated that Chongqing's war of resistance sacrifices over the past six years have been enormous, and that the difficulties encountered by one of the anti-Axis camp are tantamount to the collapse of the entire anti-Axis camp. We firmly demand world peace, but under no circumstances should freedom of the puppet "National Father" be the starting point. The human hatred of war is shared by all, regardless of whether it is pursued in the East or the West. If peace comes from the great road of the world, world wars will also stop immediately. However, if Britain and the United States do not abandon their current stubborn racial concepts and dominance, their hoped-for lasting peace can never be achieved.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ankara: Since the meeting between the British and Turkish foreign ministers in Cairo, there have been various speculations about Turkey's foreign policy. The Turkish government suddenly held an emergency cabinet meeting on the 18th, but the content of the cabinet meeting is unknown.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Setter's claim that Turkey does not adopt a secret policy and that its policy is based on the nation was refuted by Turkish MP Sadat, who said that if the public should be informed of the results of Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu's trip to Cairo, and if the government and the people feel this is necessary, then the meeting should not be held behind closed doors in secret. It would be a mistake to say that the People's Party's debate on the Cairo Conference was more intense than the debate on the British Prime Minister's visit to Adana. The Turkish government continues to maintain its obligations to friendly countries. The famous journalist Yilman expressed his opposition to Turkey's participation in the war in the Wahda newspaper, saying that Turkey should show its courage in the war for independence. The opinion that prevailed half a century ago, that there would be no war without Turkey's participation, can be declared today that Turkey no longer feels the need to fight, because the war for defense and survival is different from the war conducted by those who are attacked, and Turkey's losses would be great if it participated in the war. Because the Turkish state has not reached the level of an industrial country, it cannot fight independently, but Turkey occupies an important position on the issue of reorganizing the world.</p>

<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities stated: On the 18th, anti-Axis air forces bombed Berlin and other places, most of which were four-engine long-range aircraft. Three others made emergency landings in Sweden. The fact that the German air defense was able to achieve such results in bad weather is truly commendable. Enemy aircraft were scattered by German fighters far from their targets, so they were unable to carry out concentrated attacks and most of them abandoned their bombs in the wilderness, causing only minor damage and few casualties. It is believed that the enemy air force suffered greater losses than the German civilians.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Germany Promotes Eastern European Plan, Supports Estonia and Latvia to Complete Independence - A Powerful Response to the Moscow Conference <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report: Judging from the declarations of key figures in Latvia and Estonia, and from the comments in German and Baltic newspapers on conscription in the two countries, it is expected that there will be important changes in Latvia and Estonia. Berlin believes that the preliminary step for the two countries to restore sovereignty is to mobilize the autonomous organizations of Reval and Riga. Although German officials cannot temporarily announce the time when Latvia and Estonia will declare independence, the German side responsible for Eastern European administration is paying close attention to the issues of Latvia and Estonia, including Himmler, the leader of the German Security Forces. When he visited the Baltic countries in September, he was deeply impressed by the bravery of the volunteer soldiers in the two countries. If one wants to recognize the high combat power of the two countries, one must first understand the hope of the people of the two countries for independence. Pangaski, the leader of the Latvian Security Forces, recently stated: Only by following the German offensive and fighting can the Latvian division obtain the independent country in the eyes of the people. Before I set off for the front line, I received a guarantee from Himmler that the German High Command was closely monitoring the battle of the Latvian Legion and giving it consistent praise. The German leader said that all people who understand how to fight should have their own country. Himmler also said that the fighting of the Latvian Legion made a great contribution to the country's position in the new Europe. Based on the evolution of international politics over the past four weeks, Germany's plan for the Baltic countries is a powerful response to the Moscow Conference. The fact that Britain and the United States allowed the Moscow Merger of the Baltic countries completely shattered the hopes of the people of Estonia and Latvia to repeat the events of 1919, and the determination to rise up and fight became increasingly firm.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Model Police First Bureau: Graduation Ceremony Held Yesterday, Director Chen Personally Delivered Instructions <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The first class of 50 student police officers from the Model Police Training Institute of the First Police Bureau of this city completed their training period. Yesterday (the 20th) at 10:00 AM, a graduation ceremony was held at the Police Club on Shaoxing Road (formerly Avenue du Roi Albert). The ceremony was presided over by Su Chengde, who also serves as the institute's director. Bureau Director Chen personally attended and delivered instructions. Over a hundred people were present, including Deputy Director Du Zhengjian, chiefs of various branch bureaus, and other officials. The ceremony was quite grand.</p>
<p>Director Su's Report on the Process</p>
<p>"The purpose of this model police training is due to the fact that the old patrol police system and our national police system are different, and the quality of the police is too poor. In order to adapt to the needs of the environment and gradually improve the overall situation, a model police training institute was established in a short period of time. Due to the urgency of time, the facilities are simple in many aspects, and will be gradually improved in the future. This institute officially started training on September 20th, and it has only been over two months now. As for the first batch of police officers, because it was the inaugural class, out of 500 applicants, only 50 were selected after strict physical examinations, including one university dropout, six high school graduates, ten dropouts, and twenty-eight junior high school graduates. The educational guidelines of this institute are divided into spiritual training, academic training, and practical training. The faculty and staff of this institute and officers of the troops take turns to give various lectures to enrich ideological training."</p>
<p>Director Chen's Speech</p>
<p>"After the recovery of the two concessions, you are the first batch of trained model police. As for the service creed of the police, you should absolutely abide by the national police training guidelines and work hard to serve. Shanghai is a large city in China, and it is also a world-famous metropolis. However, in essence, the strengths of major cities are completely absent in Shanghai, and the weaknesses of major cities can be said to be visible everywhere in Shanghai. Therefore, the training and education of the police are particularly important. Because the police can exert their own power to eliminate the evils of society. We must quietly eliminate evils, maintain law and order, and improve social morality. To seek social progress, we must start with ourselves. If there is no fundamental determination and good ideas, not only Shanghai, but also one's own morality will decline. Thirty years ago, when I was studying, I was dissatisfied with the general social government officials. Now that I am an official myself, I am even more dissatisfied. However, to make others good, I am not sure, but to make myself good, I am sure. What's more, the police can exert police power, police authority, be responsible for their duties, maintain law and order, guide the people, cultivate morality, and make society progress day by day. The prerequisite is to be good yourself first, so that others have to be good. Therefore, we must train and cultivate model police to eliminate the evils in the metropolis and be a model for the people. The three types of police in the past have now been merged, and we are constantly researching and improving the unification of the police in Shanghai. Now we must recognize our responsibilities, establish a concept of serving society, exert police power, and improve social law and order and morality. I place great hope on you."</p>

<p>The Guangdong Area Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office was originally affiliated with the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, along with the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation Office. Since the Ministry of Finance expanded and reorganized the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation into the Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office, Xu Jiang, the head of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Area Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation Office, became the head, and Li Dong, the head of the Guangdong Area Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office, became the Deputy Head. However, Shunde in Guangdong is a famous silkworm producing area. Every year during the silkworm season, the silk produced is sold well in the Nanyang Islands before the incident. Its importance cannot be overstated. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance still handles the special donation affairs in Guangdong through the former Guangdong Area Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office, with only a slight adjustment in the system. The post of director of the office is still held concurrently by Li Dong, the deputy director of the Silkworm Cocoon Construction Special Donation Office. Yesterday, the news that the Guangzhou Area Silkworm Cocoon Special Donation Office was changed to a branch office and that a branch office director was appointed was a rumor.</p>

<p>The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Office, for the special allotment to various industries such as tea, biscuit, etc., and for flavoring purposes in canteens of various institutions and organizations, after re-registering and adjusting, has recently completely approved the allotment amount. Notices have been issued to pay the fees and pick up the goods at the designated sugar stores. It is reported that the various industries believe that the Cooperative Office's re-approved allotment amount this time is reduced by 60% to 70% compared to the original amount, which has affected their operations. Therefore, they all hope to find ways to increase the allotment amount to maintain their business. In addition, they also request the authorities to thoroughly ban the black market for sugar, because the black market for sugar is entirely controlled by speculators, which is harmful and unprofitable to legitimate industries. At the same time, some who originally enjoyed special allotments have been suspended this time, which has caused various difficulties in their operations. In order to make up for this, they have requested the Cooperative Office to continue to provide allotments. It is reported that the Cooperative Office has already considered it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Football League A Division match between Donghua and the Jewish team was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM yesterday. Under the conditions of favorable weather, geographical location, and popular support, Donghua overcame the Jewish team by four to two and made a good start. Donghua took the lead with two to zero in the first half. Li Yao's individual skills were most consistently praised, and Yifu Zhen's translation was slightly just right. Sun Jinshun still maintained his normal state. Han Longhai has not yet recovered from his illness, and the previous record was not as good as expected. Zhou Ji's unfamiliarity with the place was barely satisfactory, and the rest were mediocre. The Jewish team kicked off, and the ball was kicked high to the center line. Wen Tuo kicked it straight into Bang Lun's body and escaped. At 34 minutes, Yifu Zhen intercepted the ball and passed it to A Dai. Sun Jinshun broke through three passes, and Li Yao took the opportunity to shoot hard. The Jewish goalkeeper gained and lost, and Donghua took the lead. At 42 minutes, Shaman was careless for a moment, and Li Yao scored with a very good angle, making it two to zero, which was the result of the first half. After changing sides, the Jewish team marched against the wind and became even more exhausted. Sun Jinshun scored in the chaos and returned.

<p>Residents from all walks of life in this city are facing increasingly difficult lives due to the impact of rising prices of all goods. According to yesterday's newspaper war, business in various companies and stores in the city has been bleak; except for daily necessities that are still being purchased, expensive and luxury goods are obviously rarely asked about. It is also heard that the authorities are paying close attention to the lives of citizens and may find ways to thoroughly improve them.</p>
<p>The difficult lives of people in wartime are inevitably the case. We all do not complain about the heavens or blame others. However, even in difficult lives, there is still a way to improve. For example, in times of food or fuel shortages, we should thoroughly improve the supply problem, so as to ensure that the difficult living conditions of the general public do not reach the point of starvation and lack of cooking. Also, in an environment where the vast majority of people struggle at the lowest living standards all day long, there is still an existence of extravagance and indulgence, making the lives of people in wartime present an incredible contradiction: on the one hand, the smallest number of people living luxurious lives are constantly pursuing wine and food, and pursuing victory, so the trend of luxury cannot be eliminated, and the greed becomes more and more intense; on the other hand, the purchasing power of the largest number of people living in poverty is reduced from weakness to zero. It must be known that the increase in purchasing power of the smallest number of people and the sharp decrease in purchasing power of the largest number of people are both sufficient to affect the supply issue in the production sector, because the former makes the production sector consume its manpower, financial resources, and material resources on unnecessary production, such as all luxury goods, while the latter makes the production of normal needs impossible to exert, and even if it is exerted, it will form a surplus state, which is not a blessing for the production sector. Therefore, we believe that the way to improve is nothing more than striving to improve the treatment of the salaried class on the one hand, and resolutely reducing all unnecessary consumption on the other hand.</p>

<p>The "Leather Special Department" of the Business Unification Association (商統會), the organizational structure for controlling leather in Central China, is actively preparing for organization while in contact with relevant parties. It is heard that in general, the special department will include leather merchant organizations from both China and Japan, with the Chinese side being the "Joint Association of Leather Industry Guilds in Central China" (華中皮革業同業公會聯合會), and the Japanese side being the "Japanese Leather Industry Association in Central China" (華中日本人皮革業聯合會). The lower-level organizations of these two Sino-Japanese joint associations in Shanghai are, on the Chinese side, the "Shanghai Raw Hide Guild" (上海原皮同業公會), "Leather Manufacturing Guild" (製革業同業公會), and "Leather Sales Guild" (皮革販會業同業公會), all of which are being actively organized. On the Japanese merchant side, they are the "Shanghai Japanese Raw Hide Association" (卜海日本人原皮同業組合), "Shanghai Fur Association" (上海毛皮同業組合), "Leather Manufacturing Association" (製革業同業組合), and "Leather Sales Guild" (皮革販賣業同業公會). As for other areas, Anqing will have the "Anqing Area Sino-Japanese Raw Hide Association" (安慶地區中日原皮同業組合合會), jointly established by Chinese and Japanese merchants. In Ningbo, the Japanese merchant organization is the "Qingbo Area Japanese Raw Hide Association" (靑波地區日本原皮同業組合), while the Chinese merchant organization has not yet been established. In Bengbu, Hangzhou, and other places, the organizational structures for both Chinese and Japanese sides are being actively implemented. Furthermore, regarding the "China Raw Hide Company" (中華原皮會社), which unifies and controls the purchase of raw hides and is jointly funded by Chinese and Japanese merchants, its total capital has been decided to be 10 million national currency. The company's future business will be to unify and control the purchase and allocation of raw hides of cattle, horses, sheep, dogs, deer, and donkeys in various parts of Central China. It is currently being actively prepared.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the rise in Chinese stocks gradually became widespread. Medium-sized stocks within 100 yuan saw activity, such as the World Bookstore (世界警局), Kangyuan Confectionery (康無製), and Sino-French Pharmacy (中法藥房), which had surprising increases. Small-value stocks followed suit, and the trend of increasing investment in Guohua (國華) continued unabated. At noon, companies such as Wing On (永安) and cotton mills, which had been stable, also rose sharply. The stock exchange will have more than 30 popular stocks opening for one-week futures trading from next week (settlement will be processed every Monday, and the commission will increase to 1.25‰), which caused the wind of short covering to stop.

<h3 id="e56">Summary of Business Conditions <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market rose again with considerable momentum. The shorts were mostly nervous and rushed to cover their positions as soon as the price rose slightly, creating a situation where it was easy to rise and difficult to fall. Category C bonds opened slightly higher yesterday, and then there were more buyers than sellers. Due to the special supply and demand situation, the price gradually rose and did not fall back. At the end of noon, it was also the highest price of the day, which was a sharp rebound compared to the previous day. Categories A, B, D, and E all rose quite a bit, indicating that it was easier to rebound.</p>
<p>Call Loan Interest Rate: Yesterday, the money market call loan interest rate was 1.7%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Grain: Zero sales continued to shrink yesterday. The demand from all parties was still sluggish. Grain merchants continued to loosen up. The market was flat and soft.

<p>Rayon: The market continued to be weak yesterday. Sales were stagnant. The owners were not determined to sell.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: Recently, due to slight movement in sales, prices have been quite firm and high. In particular, pure alkali prices exceeded the mark because of the active sales of dyeing factories and glass factories. White wax, etc., were also popular.</p>

<p>Tea: Yesterday, tea transactions became increasingly lackluster. Although buyers came in unison, the holders were unwilling to loosen their sales. The supply on the market was dwindling, so buyers had no goods to absorb. Market prices continued to be firm. From yesterday morning to the close of the market at noon, only Rongchang Tea Shop (榮昌茶行) sold nearly 10 dan of fried Ning Yuan tea (炒寗緣茶). Also, 18 boxes of black tea were absorbed by Shenchang Tea Shop (昇昌茶棧). As for other varieties of transactions, they remained in a state of stagnation.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Unfortunate Women and Children: The General Association for the Relief of Women and Children in China <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Organization and Maintenance</p>
<p>The organizational structure of the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children in China (中國救濟婦孺總會) is headed by the Board of Directors (意事會). Under the Board of Directors is the Director of the Orphanage (留養院院長) (President: Zhao Jinji 趙晋唧, Vice President: Zhu Zikui 朱子奎). Below the Director is the Director responsible for all practical affairs of the orphanage. On the boys' side, the Director of General Affairs is Qu Zuoting (瞿佐庭), and the Director of Management and Education is Zhi Shaochu (滯少楚). The number of staff is 31. On the girls' side, the Director in charge of General Affairs, Education, and Various Affairs is Chen Shiquanlin (陳石全琳). There are also Directors and Tutors for Affairs and Drug Supervision, with a total of 11 teachers and staff, and 6 male and female workers. Due to the association's extremely difficult financial situation, the staff's treatment is unexpectedly meager. Apart from the Directors' monthly salary of more than 300 yuan, the monthly salary of general staff and teachers is less than 200 yuan, which is not enough to support their families, and even their personal daily expenses are not enough. In name, they are provided with food and lodging, but they have to share everything with those miserable women and children. They often have to go hungry and cold, and even get sick. However, the work is very heavy. According to Mr. Zhang Huiyuan (張惠元), because the association lacks funds, it cannot afford enough teachers. The teachers who were hired before left one after another because they could not bear the life below the living standard and the excessive workload. As a result, only he and another teacher are left. With these two teachers teaching 148 homeless children in the boys' orphanage who have always lacked education, even with three heads and six arms and nine mouths, it is difficult to cope. Moreover, in addition to teaching, these two teachers have to work as laborers in the orphanage and do social work outside the orphanage. Truly, in addition to the slogan of "teaching and saving children," we must also shout: "Save the teachers!" Although there are more teachers in the young children's section, their duties are also very heavy. Except for one female, all the duties that a nanny should do are also assigned to them. The 11 teachers and staff in the girls' orphanage are equally poor, but because of the division of labor, cooperation, and unity, everyone is determined to sacrifice and serve, and they no longer complain.</p>
<p>The expenses of the three orphanages of the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children in China have always relied solely on donations from Chinese and foreign benefactors. There is no foundation or fixed income. After the war, the social situation changed, and the source of donations was dwindling. In terms of food, in the past, the small amount of rice and flour donated by the American Red Cross could maintain the lives of more than 500 people, but unfortunately, it has already been used up. Now, it only relies on rice flour, which is actually far from enough. Although extremely inferior miscellaneous grains are purchased to supplement it, the cost is also quite staggering. Almost all other expenses such as clothing, education, and medical care are unsettled. "Every day is New Year's Eve" is already dangerous for ordinary families, let alone a huge charity organization.</p>
<p>In the midst of an extremely difficult economic situation, the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children applied to the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association (上海市貧病救濟協會) for subsidies. Committee members Zhou Tianchi (周天池) and Li Hong'er (李鴻爾) went to investigate and believed that it was necessary to provide assistance. It was decided to subsidize 10,000 yuan per month, starting from January of this year, for a period of three months. Later, another subsidy of 20,000 yuan was given. This has been of considerable help to the work of relieving women and children. However, according to the General Association for the Relief of Women and Children, the monthly expenditure is at least 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, while the income is only several thousand yuan from the music team, and very little is received from external donations. Moreover, the vagrant and suffering children sheltered in the girls' orphanage, the young boys' orphanage, and the two orphanages must be thoroughly reorganized and improved in terms of education and care. The cries of helpless women and children can always arouse the compassion of the relatively wealthy in society! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Origin of the Black Market for Sugar <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Junwen</p>
<p>In my hometown of Taicang (太倉), after reading the supplement published in the Fourth Japanese Newspaper about the origin of the black market for cigarettes, I feel that the sugar in my industry also has the same problems. Since this autumn, sugar has been allocated by the Sugar Industry Association (糖業公會) in the Songtai District (松太區), and it is also divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The allocation amount is also the same: the 1248 system. Since the beginning, a total of two allocations have been made, and the amount of grade A is only more than 300 catties, and the second time it is less than 300 catties. Grade D initially only had 30 to 50 catties. The allocation price is slightly less than 10 yuan, and the stipulated legal profit is the same: 20%. Therefore, grade A is only 700 to 800 yuan, and grade D is less than 100 yuan. Moreover, after deducting the monthly administrative expenses, how much is left?</p>
<p>Sugar sales in Nanhua stores (南貨店) have always regarded brown sugar as a treasure, and they have tried their best to raise its price, even more than ten times higher than the allocation price. And pregnant women generally need it, so they have to pay more than ten times the price.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that it is necessary for the authorities to crack down on the black market. However, on the one hand, the allocation amount should be increased to ensure that people can maintain their minimum needs. And for pregnant women's sugar (孕姙糖, the sugar needed by pregnant women), pregnant women should be able to apply to the stores for allocation with their residence certificates, and the stores should apply to the Sugar Industry Association for approval, and they should get an appropriate amount of allocation to meet the needs of pregnant women. It is up to the authorities to strictly prohibit the black market again, and each store will be able to meet the needs of the people without taking risks to do the black market, then the black market can be reduced naturally.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Suggestion to Distribute Power Outages by Region to Compensate for the Lack of Coal Briquette Materials <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, regardless of rich or poor, the price of fuel – firewood – which is indispensable in every household every day, has been soaring and endless. And coal briquettes, a substitute for firewood used by most residents of this city, are even more in short supply. One reason is that it is early winter, and consumption is higher than in other seasons. The most important reason is the reduction in the allocation of coal scraps, the raw material for coal briquettes. This goes without saying. In today's decisive battle system, we should, of course, fully understand the difficulties of the authorities in allocating important materials, and we should be particularly economical when burning them to offset the shortage of allocation. However, in fact, we small citizens of the salary class automatically save more when using coal briquettes because of the various difficulties in buying coal briquettes and the inability to afford black market prices. Ordinary families have canceled cooking breakfast and replaced it with buying difficult-to-buy pancakes and other foods. And after cooking dinner in the afternoon, they extinguish the embers of the coal briquettes. A limited number of relatives and friends have mentioned adopting this method, but gathering sand into a tower can help remedy the current shortage of coal. However, this passive method can only be implemented temporarily. Now that the severe cold has arrived mercilessly, we must use an active and effective method to deal with the current livelihood of the people.</p>
<p>This newspaper once published a report from Beiping (北平) stating that the Beiping authorities, in view of the fact that coal is an important material during wartime, and in order to save the general consumption of ordinary people, have taken the measure of dividing the city of Beiping into regions and taking turns cutting off electricity for a quarter of an hour. The relevant authorities in this city may wish to study and imitate it. Suppose the city is divided into several districts, and each district will stop supplying electricity for a quarter of an hour from 10:00 PM on the evening of the day specified in each week. Implementing this today under the decisive battle system is of even greater significance for conservation. After the citizens get used to it, they will definitely not feel inconvenienced. Anyway, it is an extraordinary period now, and we always have to endure it. And the coal saved as a result will definitely be considerable, which will more than compensate for the shortage of coal briquette raw material allocation.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the authorities can increase the allocation of coal scraps step by step to avoid putting citizens in a state of freezing and starvation. And the strict enforcement of coal briquette price limits is what we small citizens are always concerned about.</p>

<p>Your newspaper's advocacy of helping students has greatly benefited students who have dropped out of school and made great contributions to the country and society. Now that the north wind is freezing, and the students who receive financial aid may need to make winter clothes, the sewing costs are now soaring. A cloth coat costs no less than one hundred yuan. Our store has a sewing department with many technicians, and we aim to reduce costs through mass production. Now, we are willing to make cloth coats for students receiving financial aid at a price of twenty yuan, and woolen coats for twenty-five yuan. However, we will only temporarily accept one hundred students, and they must hold a certificate from your newspaper. We dare not call it help, but we just want to do our best. And we hope that large stores in various industries will compete to advocate this, so that students will benefit more. Xie Xing (協興) is starting this. Store address: No. 895, Xinwen Road (新問路).</p>

<p>The Old Age Relief Fund is divided into two sources of income: voluntary donations and friend assistance, which are resources for mutual assistance. It raises 10,000 yuan per month and is divided into four major parts: respecting the elderly, helping the elderly cultivate themselves, benefiting the elderly, and helping the poor elderly. The above three olds are calculated separately, first say the fourth, today's value of winter, hunger and cold double fried, temporarily with the cold, four months for a period, draw 3,500 to help 100 yuan per month for the elderly, 400 yuan for the solitary name of the bitter to help the elderly widows and divided the money to guide the 60 people, 20 yuan per person. 40 people over 70 years old, 30 yuan per person. 20 people over 80 years old, 40 yuan per person. 5 people over 90 years old, 50 yuan per person. A total of 3,450 yuan and 125 people. I hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance, save and rescue the old and pity the poor.</p>
<p>The relief fund for widows expresses sympathy. The proposal to establish a household is that I do my duty and advance both "Old Age Relief Fund" and "Widow Relief Fund." Helping widows.
