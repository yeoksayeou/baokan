<p>社評</p>
<h3>證券交易所復業</h3>
<p>華商證券交易所昨日舉行復業典禮，據聞開拍之期亦在不遠，從此社會游資得有正當出路，實業證券之流通亦可愈見圓滑。交易所直接幫助國內企業界發展，間接便是促成民族經濟建設。其復業怠義之重在，概可想見。</p>
<p>吾國民生彫敝，由於國內實業檔發逹，實業之所以不能發逹，則由於資本缺乏，似已成為一致公認的理由。可是中國果眞缺乏資本嗎？如就二十六年事變前上海的資本市傷情形而言則又不然。每逢工部局徽募一次市政公債，或者各外商公用事業公司發行一次公司價，都不到五分鐘，便已認募足額，而且認募以國人佔大多數。再京上海大多數的英美商地產公司而言，都是吮吶中國人的血汗而成立的。反之，創辦一個純粹華資事業，或者某一華商股份有限公司需要增資，或募集公司債時，情形便大不相同，主持者縱然舌敝唇焦，說得頭頭是道，擁資者還不過為了情面難却的關係，敷衍點綴一個極小的數目。我們會經硏究開析過上海一般投資者的心理，他們的理由，第一，是純綷華資事業得不到法律保障，因此投資利益絲毫沒有把握，甚至連資本也會全部犧牲。第二，華股市塲尙付闕如，一經投資，即成呆滯，設遇綏急，無法週轉，即幸而覓得一二售主，亦因無公開市價可資依據，更無從調查資產內容，不免從低估値，吃虧太甚，不如外股之隨時可以流通，並有公開市價可憑。</p>
<p>照過去情，我們不能不承認上面的話是有相當理由的，法律　不能保障，股票的不能流通，（至少不能如外股之流通）的確都是事實，也就是大部份人憚於投資華股的原因。我們既然認淸病源，便應該對病下藥，第一點是政府的責任，希望政府認淸民族經濟復興意義的重大，對於國內實業不特要盡法律保護的責任，還應該進一步的獎勵扶持。第二點是證券交易的責任，過云證券交易所所開拍的，大部份是各種國有價證券，現在却希望轉移重心到實業證券方面。</p>
<p>證券交易所的作用，好的方面固然是提倡投資，促進國內企業的發展。壞的方面，却也未嘗不可以助長投機。此次證券交易所復業後，規定祗做現現貨買賣，停做期貨買賣，足見政府當局和交易所理事會方面，對於防止投機一點，早經注意，不過停做期貨，並非可以完全杜絕投機，還賴政府當局以及所派的鹽理民和理事會三方面都能隨時密切注視，防患未然。</p>
<p>其次，應訪注意者，是上塲股票瘓格問題。凡熟悉上海華股情形者，都曉得越是內容空洞的公司，越會舖張揚厲，大事宜傳，我們主張今後對於上塲股票資格的審查，應該極端嚴格，不但公司的資產要經過專家詳細調查估價，並且對於公司的營業管理，也都要列入審查標凖範團以內。因為一個事業縱有極殷實的資產，可是營業無方針，管理不得當，事業的前途，依然是成功的希望少，失敗的機會多。這樣的事業，就根本不値得扶持。至少也不應該使未上當者再去上當。還有許多工廠，設備因陋就簡，技術故步自封，其存在不過是因綠時會，等到戰事終了，世界業恢復正常狀態以後，終必歸於淘汰。嚴格的看法，其股票京不應允許上市流通。因為從政府立塲言，不僅要利用資本市塲導納人民投資於正當的途徑，還應訪籍此督促國內工業日趨於經濟合理化。</p>
<p>在審查上塲股票資格時，還有一點應訪注意的，就是股款虎抵問題，例如革實業公司投資於某公司若干萬元，同時某公司亦反投資於某實業公司若干萬元，這種虛抵辦法，如果有一處發生問題，其他一處即受聯帶影響。我們建議這種虛抵辦法，應該嚴格取締，凡有此種情形之公司，其股票非等股款調整，經審查騐資後，絕對不許登記。</p>
<p>華股之成為人民投資對象，還不過是最近一年中的事，固然由於人民心理轉變，曉得要使中國經濟有出路，必須從振興中國實業入手。但是外股買賣的嚴萬，和外股來源的斷絕，也不無相當關係。我們如何可使外股交來完全絕跡於中國市塲，全賴證券交易所的努力。假使在證券交易所開拍的股票，都能取得投資者的信任，那麼，屛除外股於中國市塲以外，並非難事。因為目前中國實業界所需要的資金固多，且利息比較優厚，當然無須再徵逐於外股了。從前因為招商局的失放，中國數十年無航業；因為漢冶萍的失敗，中國數十年無重工業。方今是中資本市塲正在萌芽，其能否發逹，關係於中國實業前途者太鉅，決非僅僅證券交易所本身問題，我們希望交易所當局以及負責審查上塲股票的各審查委員，千萬要認淸各人對於國家民族前途的責任。</p>
<p>最後還有一點，要請證券交易所當局注意的，就是股票價格問題，像近日各項股票兔起體落的情形，使眞正投資者竟如置身五里霧中，這種現現象，亟應糾正。股票價格固無一成不變之理，但亦不能上落太鉅。不然，就紙供投機者所利用，而眞投資者反望而却步。日本證券交易所總定股票的方法，是交易所可以以大藏省之許可，收買或出售證券來調節市價。我們是否也是以採用這種方法，來均銜股票供求，穩定股票價格，似亦不妨先事硏究。不久證券開拍，關於各種股票價格的評定，我們要求交易所應以科學方法和公正態度，解決道個問題，並且要有準備隨時答復各方面提出質問的材料，切不可遷就事賽，溫無凖則，或以少數人本身利害，隨意估評，致失去社會上對於該所的信仰。</p>
<p>綜合來說，交易所復業後應該注意的共有三點：　防止投機操縱，　嚴格審查上塲股票資格。　合理股票價値，並防止劇烈漲落。這是社會上對於交易所的希望，也是交易所</p>

<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　據海通社說：南義戰傷，德軍仍處於主　地位，過去兩還中，反軸心軍誠不知將於何時何地發生戰事，僅在西區海三十至四十公軍處。德軍陣綫·大致未動·其餘各綫以迄亞特里亞海岸·凱塞林上將，故意使戰事趨於　動。快速之德軍後衛·為英第八軍前進之圍屏，白西北以迄四南約沿埃巴里，波頓薩，阿爾達姆拉一綫，其東部略向北及西北曲折，將整個福奇亞平原置於其外因此英第入軍不時被　從事政編，無從佔得據點，以便集中步兵及大砲從事大規模進攻。因此原在南部最後之第八實右翼今已在最北，而其中心及左翼則反已落後·此乃英方所最不願，而德總司令部所故意造成之局勢也。敵方雖或已知薩勒諾區為戰綫之樞紐，德軍之彈性防綫順利向北及西北轉動，但猶不知德軍之陣綫之帥動，　否已經停止、或將轉動不已。敵方對南義戰品四分之三區城內未來之發展既未能提模，乃在其餘四分之一之戰區內，即蔭勒諾區，重新增加壓力。敵軍不能隊止德軍之轉動，乃思被壞此一轉勳之樞紐，此英美軍之所以進攻薩勒諾之北及貝森蒂尼山也，此項攻勢自前日起已趨擴大·但並無若何成就可言。至於中部及軍部仍僅有疏散之小接　，此種局面，乃軍事都　家所最感興趣之局面也</p>
<h3>義駐德新大使　安夫索到任</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　墨素里尼總理委任安夫索為義大利駐德大使，昨日安氏乘機抵達柏林。德外長派外部科長代表歡迎。安夫素現任駐匈公使，乃義國最能幹之外交家，而且獲得墨氏之特別　遇，前會參與德義間多次會議，自墨氏被救後，安比即表示願受指揮。前任大使阿爾斐里曾參與在七月二十五日所舉行之法西斯大會，旦投反對墨素里尼之票者，現仍居於義大利。但巴特里奧所委任之柏里安尼將軍為駐德大使，德　從未加以登載。</p>
<h3>聶伯河兩岸　戰事進行中　德軍準備冬防措置</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　昨夜此間接獲德軍戰地消息，聶伯河中部東岸之戰及西岸之小部份戰事在進行中。西岸之戰，因少數蘇軍部隊之渡河而發展，將更有進步之趨勢，張伯河東之蘇軍重新對德軍之橋頭發勸攻勢，但無任何成功。蘇軍於星期一日集巾強有力之軍隊，以圖突破　波羅齊之東及東南，雖則蘇軍使用甫抵前綫之援軍，但其攻勢仍被擊退·某蘇軍隊伍　圖突破德軍陣地，但其裂口已被彌補，主要之陣綫得以重新建立。中部前綫，蘇軍以猛烈之攻擊，企圖　亂德軍之移動，故防禦戰事仍猛烈進行，古班橋　方而僅有局部戰事，蘇運輸船被德海軍　沉約共二千一百噸。</p>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊，軍事訪員塞托里斯稱，蘇軍在張伯河前綫擊退德軍南北兩翼之企圖，益趨明顯，蘇軍在斯摩偷斯克西南及西而以生力軍作戰，企圖向摩傑萊夫方的突被總軍陣地，但於劇戰後被擊退。蘇軍集中進攻　波　　與梅里托波爾以東之德軍陣地，亦被擊退，且遭重創。德軍特別預備隊頑強作戰，　日來蘇軍迄未實現突破克里米亞與聶伯河下流間之德軍陣地之日的。聶怕河戰局，自普里貝特至河套一帶，大體上並無變化，蘇軍進攻河束德軍之權頭堡迄未獲逞，於週未在聶伯河西降落之傘兵，大都份已被磯滅，蘇軍未能增強渡河先鋒么竇力，而四岸小隊敵軍之陣地，於前日遭德軍之反攻後，愈益縮小，僅普里貝特河口附近，兵額較大之蘇軍尚能立足，但在沼澤區域，絕少進展之可能。</p>

<p>羅馬二十九日中央社電　墨索里尼以共和注四斯政府領袖資格，昨晚在羅馬雷臺向新閣發表演新法西斯共和國當在政治方而求其一致，聯邦行政當集中注意於社會問題，工人將使之負責行政事宜擔任要職。義大利現正在波此歷史上之嚴重關頭，七月二十五日之前，義大利乃一國家，國土除西西里鳥之東部外，尚未受入侵佔，義大利國旗尚社和四嘉等地飄揚，今則三分之一之國土已為敵人所侵佔，義大利所有海外陣地亦皆以撤退，此皆苛刻之停戰條件及好詐所使然，歷史上前所未見者也。法四斯共和政府今之國策原則如次：法西斯義大利仍將忠於盟約，繼續再與德軍駢肩作戰沉着為之，以期囘復義大利之政治獨立及在世界上之地位。目前情形雖極嚴重，但並未瀕於絕望，現已開始致力於興建工作，並望新任閣員羣策軍力，負實為國服務。</p>

<h3>美陸軍將領　舉行特別會議　檢討世界戰事情勢</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城二十九日中央社電據華盛頓來皆：美陸軍部二十七日曾召集國內戰綫指導者舉行特別會議，席問由參謀總長馬歇爾暨以下陸軍將領分別說明關於最近戰局之縝密情報。會後將三名之報告要旨發表如次：陸次巴德森稱，今從之一年，將為美國歷史上最大危之期·開戰　來美國雖會經歷種種困雖，但最大之困難今後始開始。余近曾部赴太平洋戰區之前綫視察，詢及西南太平洋反軸心軍聯合司令麥克沃塞何為當前最需要者，彼答稱·唯飛機切要，故余認為必須盡可能以大量飛機輸送　綫。陸軍參謀次長馬庫維屈稱：德國現似已將飛機生產之目標，由轟炸機轉向戰鬥機，蓋此即表明德國作戰之目標已改向防禦一途，德國之守勢將因此而趨於有利。反軸心軍一意促進戰鬥之進程，此將為招致大禍之主因。陸軍牒報部長斯條古稱：德國之勞力較請四年前並未稍衰，藍德軍兵力足逮進軍波蘭時之三倍。此外日本之資源亦頗豐富，軍隊之士氣以及一般民氣亦毫未勸搖，旦佔地理上有利之戰略態勢。</p>
<p>蒙特馬頓遭遇困難</p>
<p>里斯本廿八日中央社電　據英京消息：倫敦人士皆一致認為蒙特巴頓勳爵之亞洲東南指揮部遭適空前之困難，此輩人士指出政治之爭點，係以三項主題為中心。其一為蔣介石所領導之重慶戰塲，其二為麥克沃塞所領導之太平洋西兩戰塲，其三為印度之內部情況。據云，蒙氏之總部既係先設在新德里，則印度自然為對日作戰之基本根據地·蒙氏指揮部所遭之最嚴爾複雜情形乃係印度政治經濟情記之結果。蒙氏之任務，為向印度取給供應及人力以發動攻勢，但印度此際政治既已不安，又擊重大飢饉，雖則印度之政治問題自有新任印督華維爾元帥處理·而軍事問題亦有歐慶萊將軍負責，　非蒙特巴頓之事，但着不先行計及此項問題所有之影響，則殊難發動大規模之攻勞。傳蒙氏認為如欲實行有計劃的進攻緬甸日軍陣地，則必須新聞一緬甸公路。在過去九個月間，已有美國工程師督率黑全印人及渝方之勞工，從事建造「第二頃甸路」，以供反軸心軍使用。該路此時已從印度之東北開始，據云將在重慶與臘戌間之某處與舊緬甸路連接，築路工程困難甚多，故進展極為遲緩、每日僅能移去數公尺之泥土，工人既多患瘧疾及其他熱帶病、又受風雨及山崩等威脅。</p>
<h3>日本戰時　經濟槪况　資力綽有餘裕</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　現在之戰爭，可謂為物資與金錢之戰爭，故大東亞戰爭期間之日本經濟力量，實極為世人所關注。茲特將日水之經濟怕形概括介紹如次：甲午之役日本軍費為二億元，日俄之役則增加入倍，為十五億入千萬元，然在此次大東亞戰爭中，日本戰費已達四百七十入億元。就日財源而言，公債收入及借入在甲午之役佔全額百分之五八·二六，日俄之役佔　分之九七·六七，大東亞戰爭問為百分之七六八九，然大東亞戰爭之戰費並非依　外價，乃完全以國內資金籌劃老。茲將日本國民收入</p>
<p>與英美兩國國民收入作一比較，一九四二年日本國民收入為四百五十億圓，英國為入十六　鎊，美國亞為一千一百七十億美金，又是年軍事伐日　為一百入十價圓，英國為四十五億鎊、美國為七百七十億美元，日本數額題然較少。然再就國民收入典軍事　之比例而言，日本為百分之四十，英國為百分之六十，美國為百分之六十四，　顯　日本國民之收入較英美尚有機出戰　百分之二十之餘裕。再就各國稅收而言，一九四三年至一九四四年　稅收額，日本為八十六億九千一百萬元·英國為二十九億一千萬鎊，美國則為九百一十億美金，每一國民之負担額日本為一百一十八元三角，英國為六十七鎊　合日金一千零四十大元四角），美國為三百入十七美元入角（合日金一千六百五十五元六角　，日本每一</p>
<p>國民負擔</p>
<p>僅佔英國每個國民負担之百分之十一，美國每個國民負担之百分之七。綜　上述數字，則日本財政在規模上雖尚較美美為少·　其資力實有餘裕。如日本已充分利用此點發揮其強力，而於大東亞戰爭以來已收獲光輝之戰果，反觀英美徒以龐大數字自統，而增加國民負擔，尤以美國國民之納稅力巳達其限度，美參院歲入委員會委員長喬治在半月前會說明增稅間題，謂美政府要求本年增稅一百二十億美元，但按諸實　，恐將减少三十億乃至五十億美元，蓋目前所得稅其稅率在過去已達相當高度，故難再予增加，至明年合計年度之戰費，預料將達九百零十億笑元，較本年度之一千億美元略有减少云，觀此已暗示不美團戰時財政已發生破綻矣</p>
<h3>裝設收音機　收費辦法公佈　先從京滬兩地開始徵收</h3>

<h3>糧統會收購米糧　下月起實行　十月份戶口米由原機關配給</h3>

<h3>不幸者的學府　記盲童學校（三）</h3>
<p>値得讚美的生活</p>
<p>盲童學校好像一個兵營那機有組織·有紀律·有精神；又好像一個大家庭那樣充溢着父子兄弟姊妹的天倫之愛。教職員固然視一班班的學生如自己的子弟一般，男女學生也依教職員為父母兄姊。創辦人傅關雅博士逝世已久，老校長及共得力的助丰傳步開夫婦現在也解除職務，但是他倆對於學校師生的關心愛護，恐怕比從前更殷切了。現任的校長王叔實，是一位熱心於盲啞聲十們教養事業的善士，副校長何志曾（子健）更是一位在校服務二十九年的老「家長」了。半盲的教務主任范福寶服務二十餘年，而天才盲人音樂主任昌烈卿也服務遠二十七年。餘如鄭毅如以及幾位盲老師·　有一二十年的服務歷史，已以教撫盲生培養英才為終總事業。和一般學校教職員之富於流勸性者完全不同。</p>
<p>師生感情之好，不僅由於相處之久，而尤在於彼此個性的了解。普通學校每級或班，常多至數十人，往往師長不能盡識學生姓名，流動性又大，白談不到師生情感，但是盲校上課時每班至多十人，平時男女分組工作及游息，師生間及學生相互依　的需要極大，彼此了解認議也較眞確，不僅在教學上，而且在日常生活上，形成一新家庭。</p>
<p>盲童學校對於學生，是敎養並重的。現有男女學生雖然共計只九十七人，（四分之一為前工部局兒童保障科送去的，三分之一為老學生，只有四個繳費和四五個有人指名動費一　份。其中最小者不到六歲，最大者也有二十歲以上的。）為求敎養上的完善，敎戰員人數就不能太少，現有八人，實有忙得透不過來氣之苦，又為着學校離市區太遠，交通不便，不能收容走讀生，全部都在校寄宿，在生活建議上便特別費心，每一宿舍，都有一位監護者，五六年級至初中部的男女生布舍不必說都很整潔，保姆兼會　管理員張華女士領導到她負實的一二年級盲生的宿舍，葉重華女士領着去看她負責的女學部宿舍，也都收拾得整潔美化，再加上房屋建等的特別講究，每一房間都是三面開窗，裝有美麗的窗帷，帷外是開關的　林，室內一律是鐵床，白毯白被·摺疊得整整醫齊，地板像天上臘一樣光滑。這應該是最有幸福者的理想的臥室了！</p>
<p>育實們日常生活，鄭是有規律的，一清早起身清潔工作以後，就上操塲作適當的運動。不要　猜育人不會作團體操或集團運動，出乎意外的是男女盲童都愛好運動，尤其愛好集團運動。從而參加江蘇省立學校聯合還動會還得過團體遲動成續優良的獎狀呢！</p>
<p>課業之外·盲童們有的在休息審談笑，有的在圍林裏散步，但是音樂室和圖書館總是不會太冷清的。因此學校常常溢出和悅的琴聲。而圖書館的藏書，眞可算得洋洋大觀，大多數是育人特用的課太參者書，工具嘗，圖表及歷史。這裏還有一種比較新穎的盲文·是簡寫，也是厭印在特　紙片上的凸體字，專供記憶力較寰退的老盲人用的。還有許多盲人用的樂譜，有許多人在眞正的「研摩一着，因為只有研摩熟透了　諸之後，才能移到樂器上去，盲人是不能對譜奏演的啊！</p>
<p>盲童敎育的前途</p>
<p>盲童學校給人的印象是那麼美麗，令人贊羨！然而，表面的壯觀究竟掩不佳內部的恐慌與困離啊</p>
<p>當然，目前最主要的問題是經費問題。在平時，一向依靠各界樂捐。幾年來慘澹經營，內情却極為雖，因為原有一切經費來源既完全斷絕，而物價不斷飛騰，開支却無法節制！敎員責重事繁，而每月薪金最多不過二百五十元，工役十人不過五十至七十元，「機牲服務」四字，可以當之無愧。但其他開支，却是無法節省的啊！以本年上學期的該校一統計來響，總支出三十五萬六千一百七十四元八角二分中，伙食一項即占二十九萬五千八百二十七元、可說是當前的最大困難，實際上全校師生一律第天只吃三　粥，所以要開支這麼大的一筆雙用原因是：（一）該校地址在外警戒　與淸鄉區之間，並無戶口米可領，食米一槪須向黑市高價購買；（二）去年存有捐助碎麥四百包已經食　。氯堿　說當前最急的是糧食問題·如果當局准許配給特別戶。米、那麼問題就可解決一大半。次之則任何物質上的援助，也很一期待，例如盲人用的書籍紙張等，現在來源已絕，他們已改用舊雜誌（厚紙者，打印盲字，編訂課本，這　舊書雜誌，就盼望各界捐助。現在他們只求維持這一中國唯一大規模的盲人敎養事業，並準備在不久的將來恢復工藝，印刷，書報等部，成為金國盲人敎養運動的領導者，為全國不幸的盲　男女建設一個自由幸福的新天地。這個理想的實現，正期待社會上眞正熱心的　普家的協助（完）</p>

<h3>裝置無綫電收音機者　今起締結收聽契約　並應按月繳納收聽費十元　日駐滬總領通知日僑遵辦</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　宣傳部公佈實施收音機裝置許可制，並准許中國廣播協會　十月一日起，得與收音機所有人締結收聽契約，按月取收聽費十元，實施地區暫以上海南京兩特別市為限，然後再漸次擴展至一般地域。又華北方面早於去年六月實施同樣辦法，常地日僑亦照繳收聰貴。華中方面當亦採取同樣措置。上海日總領事館特於二十九日發布第三十九號告示，並由總領事館當局發表談話，茲分誌如次。</p>
<p>告示</p>
<p>在上海特別地區內，凡裝有以收聽廣播無綫電為目的之無綫電收音機者，應於十月一日至十月十四日期間內，與財團法人中國廣招協會締結收聽契約。十月一日以降，有欲新裝收音機者，應於裝置前締結上項契約。昭和十入年九月二十九日駐滬總領事矢野征記</p>
<p>談話</p>
<p>又日總領事館當局發表談話云：國民政府當局此次由宣傳部公佈實施收音機裝置許可制，同時准許廣播協會向裝置無綫雷收音機人按月收取收聽費十元，自十月一日趕實施實施地區為上海南京兩特別市地區，今後再漸次擴展至其他地區。按廣播協會為非以營利為目的之財協和法人，全部收聽　係用以充實及改善廣播事業，廣播事業在戰時下之思想戰文化戰上負有重大使命，固不待言。日方為積極援助該協會完成使命起見，認為上海特別市地區內之日本僑民，亦以負擔該項收聽費為妥，已另以本館第三十九號告示規定應締結收聽契約，華北已於去年五月實施無綫電收音機裝置許可制，並微收收聽費，當地日僑亦均繳納收聽費。此次告示所指定地區內現持有無綫電收音機者，應於十月一日至十月十四日期間內，與廣播協會締結收聽契約，切勿遺漏。又十月一日以降有欲新裝無綫電收音機者，應於裝置前先行締結契約，對於契約內容務希一一遵守。又如有避不締結契約或不遵守契約內容者，則當予以相當處分。</p>

<h3>華商證券交易所　昨舉行復業禮　雙十節左右可開拍交易</h3>
<p>上海華商證券交易所，自奉財政實業兩部會令籌備以來，各項設施均已準備就緒，假定十月入日即可正式開拍交易，萬一準備小及，亦僅延遲至雙十節左右兩日之問，故該所特於昨（二十九）日上午十時舉行復業典體，是時計到財政實業兩部，及各機關代表暨參歡典禮金融工商各界來賓不下四五白人之多，茲分誌各情如下：</p>
<p>參加觀禮來賓代表</p>
<p>是時計到各機關代表有實業部次長袁愈佺，實業部駐滬辦事處長章駿，商品檢騐局長陳中，商標局長項峋，保險當理局長孫祖基，財政部駐滬辦事處長李澂，第一區公署經濟處長陳日平，各監理委員及金融工商各界聞入聞開亭林康侯潘仰堯吳蘊齊許冠羣金宗城等。</p>
<p>報告籌備復業經過</p>
<p>張理事長慰如致開會詞後，報告籌備復業的經渦，大意謂本所自事變以來，營　停帕已逾六年，此次籌備復業，事非簡單，本年二三月間，各證劵字號因交易方法不盡公善，違背法規，計有一百餘家，被前工部局服締，經過兩個月之久，遂感覺有交易所的必要，後來政府鑒於上海為全國經濟的中心點，在戰時經濟體制之下流通證券，調劑金融，交易所實在是不可缺少的機關，又因本所在上海設立已達二十年左右，對於社會，不無相當成續，因有已往的歷史關係，所以本年七月問　實兩部，遂會同令飭　術復業，在七月二十四日股東會開學後，即積極籌備，但交易所所負的使命很大，自當愼重其事，所以直到現在，大致就緒，今天舉行復業與禮，不日即可正式開幕，請求諸位賜予指導，以匡不遠。</p>
<p>實來部袁次長訓詞</p>
<p>袁次長致訓詞，略謂：現在戰時經濟體制下，國家政策係採經潛統制主義，照一般情形　起來，　乎不應再用自由買賣主義，自相矛盾，交易所更不必復業，政府以為各種經濟統制，除與國家政策有重　關係者外，對於人民之證券交易，自不必一槪統制，且鑒於證卷流通，對於國計民生，均有影響，為金融上所不可缺少的機關，所以於本年七月間，命令交易所復業，但是政府旣採國家統制經濟政策，對於交易所此後進行各種營業，自應加以相當監督，相當干涉，而使與從前的交易所不同，且從前的交易所專門經營公債，現在大部份在於股票，股票發達，更希望有一個正規的交易所，主持共間，庶不致於有其他流弊。</p>
<p>財部代表李瀓訓詞</p>
<p>財政部代表李處長訓　·略謂，營業第一要務，在於從事交易，遵守法律，一切章則，務須規定縝密，信守不渝。一方面可使游資納入正軌，扶助各種工商企業，日趨發達；一方面可使資金流通圓滑，安定金融，對於國計民生，諸多裨益·貴所復業從事合法交易『更可較前活躍，實有極大期望。</p>
<p>林康侯代表來賓詞</p>
<p>最後銀行公會秘書長林康侯氏代表來　致祝詞、略謂，今天交易所復業，猶如事變後破壞之鐵道，已經政府整理好了，今後業務都上軌道。在此非常時期，希望貴交易所，各位經紀人應以事業為職責，勿以管利為日的。</p>
<p>下月初旬正式開拍</p>
<p>最後記者叩詢該所張理事長·據談該交易所經紀人確定二百家，每一經紀人保證金規定五十萬元，所以各種道契有價證券及銀行存單銀行担保等為担保品，現上市交易股票，登記者已超過一百六十家以上，原擬即日可實行·開拍交易·因經紀人電話朱裝置完竣，及上市股票名稱尚須審定後，送經監理委員會核準·故正式開拍須延至十月十日左右，（現假定十月八日開拍未完全確定）至於正式開拍交易規定為現貨交易七天交割一次，開拍證劵，首重以紗廠股銀行及其他有價證券，惟須呈准政府登記領有營業執照者為限·開拍時間以上午九時半至寸二時，下午二時半至四時半為開取盤時間云。</p>
<h3>經濟處召開　醬業座談會</h3>
<p>上海特別市第一區經濟處經濟團體管理科，為聯絡各業調查物價，商討各項間題，故經於本月起，分別翰流召美各業負奮人舉行座談會，交換意見，藉以安定民生，今（三十）日下午三時，在該　會議室，召集　園業，　業之調味粉製造廠業，調味鮮汁業，井公會負貴人談話，屆時對資醬油調味鮮汗等之產銷問題，當詳加討論云。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>市商會兩個議決案</h3>
<p>此次上海特別市商會常年會員代表大會所議決的各要案中，共中兩個是特別值得大家擁質的：一個是絲及製品應請准許自由搬運，一個是紗布給價存單應請免息貼現：　者是要求政令之貫澈·後者是要求政令之補救，而其意思的表示·則適合本報社評中所曾發揮者。我們對於地方行政，曾經強調指陳同一轄境之內，不當有不同之政治，設施；對於收買紗布·會經坦白表示，事前容有設想未周之處，則事後補救，實為必要。</p>
<p>以絲及製品之自由搬運而言，明明常以「戰時物資移動取締暫行條例」及「全要商品登記規則「為準總，自屬毫無疑義·況物資統制之最高權威—全國商業統制總會—既曾函知絲綢業同業聯合會，絲繭，綢緞及絲織品在三省二市或本布內移動，依照戰時物資移動取締暫行條例規定，可毋須由該會許可，則此外各地主管官署·即使職權所在，似亦祗能遵照現行中央法令辦理，而不能別樹一幟。</p>
<p>以紗布給價存單之免息貼現而言，我們雖不能斷定中央對於免息貼現一個請求的反應為如何，可是，我們到底主張金融上之教濟，不論其方式是怎樣，在收買紗布從之今日，是有絕對必要的，而其執行之責任，則凡為行莊，都覺義不容辭，祇是行莊之協力，仍有賴於中央儲備銀行，以其「銀行之銀行」的地位，為其最有力的後盾。</p>

<h3>開戰二年後　蘇聯的政治力量　蘇聯戰力分析之二</h3>
<p>德蘇戰二年後的今日任何人不能否認，史太林政權非低毫無勸搖，而且更見強化。以前本來有人這樣說、史太林政權的崩潰，就長蘇維埃聯邦的小存在、而蘇維埃聯邦的崩潰·就是史太林政權的消滅。這種關係。自德蘇開戰後，俞見密切。</p>
<p>就史太林太身說來·他最近除得了元帥的幫號而更加強蘇軍最高　令官的地位外，兼任國家防衛委員會議長·蘇維埃聯邦人民委員會議長，國防人民委員，蘇維埃聯邦共產黨中央委員會書記長等戰時蘇聯最重要的地位，一手包辦軍政兩方而最高的指揮權。</p>
<p>尤其從第一次第二次冬季反攻中，史太林指導蘇軍的反攻力、恢復陷於德軍占領下的若十失地以來·民衆對史太林的信仰愈見高昻，「祖國」和「史太林」買可說是同意語·「為了史太林」和「為了祖國」同樣是煽動前綫後方士氣的有效的標語。</p>
<p>蘇聯民衆以為史太林就是祖國，是祖國的防衛者，救濟者，他個人的地位，奠定了梅穩固的基礎。要之·史太林是列寶政策之忠實的後繼者·布爾歇雜克主義政策之忠實的實行者，且又是天才的政治家，戰略家。因為史太林是共產主義者，蘇聯是社會主義國家，他的地位是不動的·所謂獨裁者史太林·也就是共產黨政權的事支柱。所以我們不能不理解、史太林政權者·就是共產黨政權的意思。</p>
<p>是以要說到史太林政權的動向、不能不觀察共產黨的活動。以下試對德蘇戰二年來共產黨作如何活動來加以檢討。</p>
<p>共產黨的全力活動</p>
<p>蘇聯自建國以來，根據國家第一主義整備一切機構，民衆也在國家第一主義下從事勞慟。這情形德蘇開戰後亦不受何等變化，國家第一主義依然為對德戰的根本·不過所謂同家變成了祖國而已。</p>
<p>共產黨在戰前是國家的中樞，德蘇開戰後·這關係一點也沒有變化。共產黨在前綫後方依然是遂行對德戰的推行，共產黨的政策決定政府的政策。而且黨中央執行委員會的會員，也沒有什麼變化，故共產黨依然採行不變政策</p>
<p>史太林把開戰後黨機關的活動規定於二種方向，其一是擴大和平建設，組織有力的後方，其二是遂行蘇軍之攻勢防衛戰鬥。共產黨在史太林所規定的二條戰綫上盡全力活動，在後方成為軍需生產的增大及農產物的增收之推進力，在前綫，提高蘇軍的戰力，鼓舞士氣，振肅軍紀，盡着巨大的任務。</p>
<p>據紅星報所載：「戰爭是黨員的學校，是試騐傷，」蘇聯經由戰爭而提高黨員的政治意識，經由戰爭而教寶非黨員，從事共產黨的強化。這就是史太林所說的政治意織之昻揚，並立即反映於抗戰力上，而抗戰力的增大，也導向政治意織的昻揚·彼此交相作用着。</p>
<p>史太林在本年五月一日勞慟節發表的佈告上，指出波無的森戰之重要性，要彌化波羅的森戰，不能不首先昻揚民衆的政治意職，即抗戰意職·而注其全力於政治宣傳。</p>
<p>其結果，黨員必然大景增加·但現因入黨手續較煩，故受相當妨害，蘇聯各報乃要求把入黨手續簡單化。尤以在戰綫上，因在進行日常戰鬥·故入黨手續如何，有重大的影饗。</p>
<p>結果，入黨手續大見緩和，軍隊中黨員的數量，急激地增加起來。同時，因着入黨手續的緩和·預料黨員的會案必將低下·並將發生其他睹種弊害，共產黨為防止上述弊害起見，講求種種適常措置。</p>
<p>又在後方的共產黨主要活動分野，在於提高勞例生產性，強化勞勸紀律，增大生產，涵養勞勸實農民之髪國無我的精神·例如一地方的黨　關·負起農業增屋的實任·在收獲季時派遺許多黨員先鋒隊　各地，指導農民·以身作則，重範於農民。繼由這種勞慟的政治教育·和在前綫經由戰鬥的政洽教靑同樣。收得極大的效果。又據眞理報的報這，去年高加索諸共和國在德軍的威骨下時·史太林派遣倍利耶組織從高加索的防衛。聰說倍利耶給合古爾奇耶·阿賽巴琴，亞美尼亞諸共和國的防衛力，在　緒後方組織堅固的防衛力這價種例子不僅倍利耶一人，譬如巨達諾夫的在列寗格勒戰綫，佛兒希齊岳夫的在南郁戰終，機加得金的在西北戰綫，美夫利斯的在伏爾審夫戰綫等·不邊一一　舉。</p>
<p>政治宣傳更見強化</p>
<p>蘇聯的政治宣傳不能離間黨而單獨考察，在戰時下尤共如此，以前會說：「黨機關不能不知道政治宣傳是民衆視為空氣一樣必要的，」或「政治宜傳在黨員等於輸血，」德蘇開戰以來·因政治宣傳特別痛感到有必要，故宣傳員或煽動員的數量，大為增加。</p>
<p>在還裹成為問顯者，德蘇開戰以來·蘇聯傾其全力於昻揚國民的愛國心，提出今日以前不常使用的「祖國」這名詞，把對德戰加上「祖國戰爭」的名義，進一步刺戟前後方的崇拜英雄熱，加深民衆以為放棄共產主義宣傳的印象，然而蘇聯決不放棄共產主義宣傳，毋靑隊更予強化。</p>
<p>蘇聯倣拿破侖侵略莫斯科的例，規定為「祖國防衛戰爭」當作此次戰爭的目的。遺清楚地暗示史太林之聰明的意圖。他除開本國，把其他國家的戰爭目的，說是從帝國主義的意圖出發，在此點上，蘇聯的宣傳依然無所變更。</p>
<p>尤其關於英美二國的戰爭目的，在德蘇開戰之前，規定為帝國主義戰爭，開戰以從，因和蘇聯發生了關係，乃稱之為為民主主義的戰爭，為自由的戰爭，媚態畢露，但這不用說是極現實主義的基礎上，第一次五年計劃告終後，因各國對蘇聯的包衛政策而第二次世界大戰的危機日趨成熟的時候起，蘇聯即以打動國民的愛國心。當然，萬一對蘇十字軍勃發時，蘇聯認為愛國心實是強化蘇聯民衆抗載力最重要的因素。</p>
<p>所以德蘇開戰以後，蘇聯當然也從事。煽動國民的愛國心，宜傳說保住從未受過外敵欺侮的俄羅斯的傳統，在蘇聯當局，那不過是遂行戰爭必要上的一種政策。要之，祖國者非別，即社會主義的祖國也</p>
<p>然而蘇聯現在和英美結着同盟，為了和德國交戰起見，不能不利用英美二國的力量，所以稱英美為民主主義的防衛者，自由的友人。但因着變化莫測的世界戰局之要求，不能不一旦和英美開　時，「民主生義的防衛者，自由的友人，」立即變成「帝國主義者」。</p>
<p>耍之，蘇聯止在從事想經由共產主義宣傳而強化蘇聯的拉戰力，這一點並無何等變化。如上所述，蘇聯的強化政治宣傳，並不是脫離現實，而在抽象的名詞，止活動乃是通過現實的戰塲和戰傷上的活動。而且在蘇聯，政洽宣傳的武器，是共產全義宣傳，這是無可歸飾的事實。</p>
<p>總而言之，前後方的愛國心敵愾心之昻揚，經由共產主義宣傳而可致期待，乃是蘇聯獨得的方法，「一切為了戰爭」的標語，也在這種形式上實現着。（本章完全文未完）（翔　自同盟世界週報第一二二三號）</p>

<h3>防止非法加價及黑市買賣的對策</h3>
<p>— 陳乃超</p>
<p>抑平物價的方法·消滅投機囤積的對策等等，這一類的文字·在報章雜誌上已經常見不鮮，但是大多數都是極籠統大概廣義的方法，本文是祇限於商店及制造廠的非法加價及黑市買賣。因為一切物價的抬高部受店號的黑市買賣所影響，並且他們用種種的狡計，逃過當局的羅綱。　就管　所及，建議如下：</p>
<p>以前工部局的限價，袛能實行於較大的公司，商店。至於小店家，每每看「不懂市面」的人就超出限價發售，否則就是一句「沒有」。他們既無發票，又無憑據，當局就是明知，也沒有辦法捉到牠的「痛足」。就是較大的店號，每有限價的貨物，因為牠們有發票，所以都不在門市上發售，而是以黑市價批發於小店，這樣一來，限價就失了效用。還有一點限價的價格，每每為一班奸商所根據，「工部局的限價已經是多少了」。黑市當然是一倍兩倍了。同時工部局的限價時時增高，所以貨物的黑市價也不斷的向上漲。如果要限價，必需規定公平的實價，一經規定後，不能隨便自漲，靑願賣完為止。如果一經查出超越限價，則以最嚴格的處罰，決不能問代了事。據日本來的一個友人說日本的百貨公司賣到空，仍不能漲價。</p>
<p>現在很多工廠已經交遼我國，以後出品·以其質料為準·分為甲乙丙丁數等級，　定價格，不許製造五花入門，使執行戰時生產劃一制，同時調查亦較便利。</p>
<p>除了工廠製造劃一外，還要將每種出品物的名稱，號碼，　價及樣品交是當局存記，同時每出一種新物品亦必須登記。經常局批準然後方可在由上出售。還樣當局便有根據有樣品，調查就簡便得多了。未經登記批準的，一槪不許發售。譬如去年，有一種葡葡酒，當時賣三十餘元，後來換一個牌子，費六十元，現在又換一個牌子賣一百餘元。</p>
<p>還有工廠出品物必須標明出產日期·如果是有商標紙者就寫明其上。如果是織治品　在其邊卜，機明出品日期，如果是五金品卽在其身上或底上厭明出品日期。這樣一規定價格後，凡是這一時期的出品，永遠亦不許漲一分一毫，這樣一來囤積者亦不能養動了。</p>
<p>凡是發售店一律要開發票給購買者，發票上必須寫明該貨物名稱，貨號，廠名，價格字樣，少一項不行。如無發票及糊塗名詞皆在處罰之例。每每商店的出賣超過限價的買品，牠的發票總是糊糊塗塗的寫。例如「布一尺，綢一尺或是A茶，B茶等等暗記。這種的變法常然瞞過一切了。</p>
<p>配給品如香烟火柴，往往被配給的零售商揩起百分之七十以上的油，由黑市出售，寥寥的在門口出售百分之三十，假使你說他沒有賣，實在他又有得賣，如果說他賣，他又賣一點點，這樣當局是極不易調查。防止這種辦法是極不易，如果開發票，香烟又是這樣細小，概價又這樣貴，賺也賺不到還張紙價。祇有平時一概不許移運（啤酒自由移運，巡捕不受理·就釀成黑市買賣之便·所以黑風極熾，）每日發售後，由常局派員點查存貨。</p>
<p>一切存貨不論商店，私人，工廠等·來一個細登記·由當局給一張登記證，書明貨主貨名，數量地點，將據出售移動，亦須向當局登記過戶·並書明價格·這樣也是防止黑市的一個辦法。這辦法已經實行·可是未澈底，不過些　貨食及統制品。至於私人住宅及零售商的囤貨數目的確不少。如果要社絕囤積。不論任何貨物·數量多少，都要詳細登記澈底的實行。</p>
<p>有一班投機商人開一班所謂行號·字號，西藥行等等名詞，專門做投機黑市或代人買賣黑市貨物。當局對於這種店號，必須來一個登記，再加一翻調查，以其生意是否正當，否則勒令停閉以减少黑市之巢穴。</p>
<p>在戰爭時期，物資供不勝求，是一定的道理，所以一班奸商趁這機曾，壟斷物價，使漲無止境，小則影響到民衆生活，大則影響民族國家的前途。現在接收租界後，進行比較直接，消滅投機，囤積，黑市是當今急務。牠們在國家社會，好像是人體內的寄生虫，我們必須對症下藥打針來消滅牠。</p>

<h3>一個自瀆的靑年</h3>
<p>— 竹</p>
<p>大雨雖止了，天上是白茫茫的，仍有雨意·此時·空氣是非常沉悶。我步上晒台·以求散悶。這是　常的事：因為晒台下面是一片廣大的　山，在風和日暖的日子，每有很多的人當它花　般的在山多的人當它花園般的在　中徘徊，我在上面可以看到偎倚着或相挽着手的一對對、以及各種形態的人、和一方方的墓石。可是今天我所見到的是一件使我非常傷感的事，也可說是社會上可痛心的事。</p>
<p>一個約模二十歲左右的靑年，身上披着件雨衣，躲在密樹林的一邊·鬼鬼祟祟的向外張。他見沒有人近，就開始幹他自殺的行為—乎淫—却不知有我望着他。大風吹着樹葉呼呼作聲，他許在　擻着數分鐘·於是整衣離開此地。天色漸漸變烏了，下着迷茫的小雨。我的視絡中亦消失了他的形跡。</p>
<p>雖是一個靑年，在消耗他的精力之　，又受風雨的點擊，能不多病。無怪乎近年來，患有肺癆病的青年格外的多。自然是身體衰弱·易受病菌授觸的緣故。靑年是國家的　石，社會的中堅。假使部架　　·前　有尚有何望。我實悲之。上海固然是個卯惡的都市；如淫書之易得曉四週之引誘，奢靡的風尚·每易仲意志薄弱的靑年·不克外來的引誘，染成種　的惡習，以至毀滅，不可棄教。此是多　痛心的事！</p>
<p>我　盼為父母者，能透澈的將其中利害　購愛子。使他知道以種行為等於自殺，走上毀滅之途。再盼當局能收毀一切淫書，改良都市風尚，取締不良引誘。則裨益國家社會實非淺鮮。</p>

        <h1>1943.09.30</h1>
<h3>Securities Exchange Resumes Operations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Securities Exchange held its reopening ceremony yesterday. It is said that the opening of trading is not far off. From now on, idle social capital will have a legitimate outlet, and the circulation of industrial securities will become smoother. The exchange directly helps the development of domestic enterprises and indirectly promotes national economic construction. The importance of its resumption of operations is self-evident.</p>
<p>The hardship of our people's livelihood is due to the underdeveloped domestic industries. The reason why industries cannot develop is the lack of capital, which seems to have become a universally recognized reason. But does China really lack capital? If we look at the capital market situation in Shanghai before the "Twenty-Sixth Year Incident," it is not the case. Every time the Public Works Bureau issued municipal bonds or foreign public utility companies issued company bonds, they were fully subscribed in less than five minutes, and most of the subscribers were Chinese. Furthermore, most of the British and American real estate companies in Shanghai were established by sucking the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. On the other hand, when starting a purely Chinese-funded enterprise or a Chinese joint-stock company needing to increase capital or issue corporate bonds, the situation is very different. Even if the promoters speak eloquently and persuasively, the investors only contribute a small amount out of consideration for their relationship. We have studied the psychology of general investors in Shanghai. Their reasons are: First, purely Chinese-funded enterprises do not receive legal protection, so there is no guarantee of investment returns, and even the capital may be completely sacrificed. Second, the Chinese stock market is still lacking. Once invested, it becomes stagnant. If there is an emergency, there is no way to turn it around. Even if one or two sellers are found, there is no public market price to rely on, and there is no way to investigate the asset content. It is inevitable to underestimate the value and suffer too much loss. It is better than foreign stocks, which can be circulated at any time and have a public market price to rely on.</p>
<p>According to the past situation, we cannot but admit that the above words have considerable reason. The law cannot guarantee, and stocks cannot circulate (at least not as easily as foreign stocks), which are indeed facts and the reasons why most people are reluctant to invest in Chinese stocks. Since we have identified the source of the problem, we should prescribe the right medicine. The first point is the responsibility of the government. We hope that the government recognizes the importance of national economic revitalization and should not only fulfill its responsibility to protect domestic industries legally but also further encourage and support them. The second point is the responsibility of the securities exchange. In the past, the securities exchange mainly traded various national securities, but now it is hoped that the focus will shift to industrial securities.</p>
<p>The role of the securities exchange, on the positive side, is to promote investment and promote the development of domestic enterprises. On the negative side, it can also encourage speculation. After the reopening of the securities exchange, it is stipulated that only spot transactions will be made and futures transactions will be stopped, which shows that the government authorities and the board of directors of the exchange have long paid attention to preventing speculation. However, stopping futures trading cannot completely eliminate speculation. It also relies on the government authorities, the dispatched inspectors, and the board of directors to closely monitor and prevent problems before they occur.</p>
<p>Secondly, what should be paid attention to is the qualification of listed stocks. Anyone familiar with the situation of Chinese stocks in Shanghai knows that the more hollow the content of the company, the more it will exaggerate and publicize it extensively. We advocate that the examination of the qualifications of listed stocks should be extremely strict in the future. Not only should the company's assets be thoroughly investigated and valued by experts, but also the company's business management should be included in the scope of examination standards. Because even if a business has extremely solid assets, if the business has no direction and the management is improper, the future of the business still has little hope of success and more chances of failure. Such a business is fundamentally not worth supporting. At least, one should not allow those who have not been deceived to be deceived again. There are also many factories whose equipment is crude and simple, and whose technology is stagnant. Their existence is only due to temporary opportunities. When the war ends and the world economy returns to normal, they will eventually be eliminated. Strictly speaking, their stocks should not be allowed to be listed and circulated. Because from the government's standpoint, it should not only use the capital market to guide people to invest in legitimate ways, but also use this to urge domestic industries to become more economically rational.</p>
<p>When examining the qualifications of listed stocks, another point that should be paid attention to is the issue of cross-shareholding. For example, Company A invests a certain amount of money in Company B, and at the same time, Company B also invests a certain amount of money in Company A. If a problem occurs in one place with this kind of fictitious method, the other place will be affected. We suggest that this kind of fictitious method should be strictly prohibited. The stocks of companies with this kind of situation should not be registered until the shares are adjusted and the funds are verified after examination.</p>
<p>The fact that Chinese stocks have become the target of people's investment is only a matter of the recent year. Of course, this is due to the change in people's psychology, knowing that if the Chinese economy is to have a way out, it must start with revitalizing Chinese industries. However, the strict control of foreign stock trading and the interruption of foreign stock sources are also related. How can we completely eliminate foreign stock trading from the Chinese market depends entirely on the efforts of the securities exchange? If the stocks traded on the securities exchange can gain the trust of investors, then it is not difficult to exclude foreign stocks from the Chinese market. Because at present, the Chinese industrial sector needs a lot of funds, and the interest rates are relatively generous, so there is no need to pursue foreign stocks any more. In the past, because of the failure of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, China had no shipping industry for decades; because of the failure of the Hanyeping Iron and Coal Company, China had no heavy industry for decades. Today, the Chinese capital market is just sprouting. Whether it can develop is too important for the future of Chinese industries. It is not just a matter for the securities exchange itself. We hope that the exchange authorities and the members of the review committee who are responsible for reviewing the listed stocks must recognize everyone's responsibility for the future of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Finally, one more point that the securities exchange authorities should pay attention to is the issue of stock prices. The recent situation of various stocks rising and falling sharply makes genuine investors feel like they are in a fog. This phenomenon should be corrected as soon as possible. Of course, there is no reason for stock prices to remain unchanged, but they cannot rise and fall too sharply. Otherwise, it will only be used by speculators, and genuine investors will be deterred. The method of determining stock prices by the Japanese Securities Exchange is that the exchange can buy or sell securities to regulate the market price with the permission of the Ministry of Finance. Whether we can also adopt this method to balance the supply and demand of stocks and stabilize stock prices, it seems that it is also worth studying in advance. Soon, the securities will be traded. Regarding the evaluation of the prices of various stocks, we require the exchange to solve this problem with scientific methods and a fair attitude, and to be prepared to answer questions raised by all parties at any time. Do not compromise the facts, have no criteria, or evaluate at will based on the interests of a few people, resulting in the loss of social trust in the exchange.</p>
<p>In summary, there are three points that the exchange should pay attention to after resuming operations: Prevent speculation and manipulation, strictly review the qualifications of listed stocks, and rationalize stock values and prevent drastic fluctuations. This is the hope of the society for the exchange, and it is also the exchange.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Aircraft Bombard Western Australian Coast, Exterminate Truscott Airfield Base</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 29th telegram: The enemy continues to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan in the South Pacific. While fighting in East New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, they are also preparing to establish a base in the Truscott area on the east coast of the Indian Ocean, about 500 kilometers west of Darwin, as the only forward base for the East Indies. After learning of this attempt, the Japanese Air Force also made all preparations to destroy it in one fell swoop. On the 27th, several large squadrons of army and navy aircraft jointly launched an attack. On that day, army and navy aircraft flew across a certain sea and reached the Torresdale airfield on the west coast of Australia. They carried out low-altitude bombing and completely destroyed the runway, barracks, enemy aircraft, and all other military facilities of the enemy airfield. At the same time, a fuel depot hidden in the forest near the airfield was also completely destroyed. The enemy's base, which had been painstakingly built over a long period of a year, was instantly turned into ashes. After reaping great results, all Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 29th telegram: The Japanese Air Force attacked the Torresdale airfield near Albert Point, about 500 kilometers southwest of Darwin Port, Australia, at 9:30 am on the 27th, destroying the fuel and ammunition storage sites near the airfield. Two large fires broke out, and the airfield's ancillary facilities were completely destroyed. Other fires also broke out near the airfield. All Japanese aircraft have returned safely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) A certain Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific, 29th telegram: On the night of the 27th, the Japanese Navy's seaplane squadron attacked the enemy positions at the southeastern end of Bielrabiera and Arundel Island. They braved enemy anti-aircraft fire and bombed fiercely, returning to base safely.</p>
<h3>Japanese "Ryusei" Aircraft Bombard Port Moresby, Australian Forces in New Guinea Suffer Setback</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese base in the South, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) In the New Guinea area, Japanese army aircraft attacked the enemy airfields of Port Moresby and Fabuba on the 20th. It is reported that this Japanese aircraft squadron was composed of the new heavy bomber "Ryusei No. 1," and there was no fighter escort. They carried out a brave bombing. The details of the battle on that day have been reported by two petty officers who returned to the Japanese base. The main points are recorded as follows: On that day, it was raining suddenly and the weather was bad. However, after the order to attack the enemy base in Port Moresby was issued, the "Ryusei" unit took off from somewhere in the morning and proceeded towards the destination. The brave aviation fighters had completely disregarded life and death. At a certain time in the morning, they arrived over Port Moresby. The first shell of the enemy's anti-aircraft guns exploded in front of the squadron, followed by the sound of enemy shells exploding in the rear or west. The enemy's anti-aircraft guns were desperately firing. However, the Japanese aircraft were still able to maintain the squadron formation, brave the enemy's artillery fire, and accurately bomb important military facilities, causing them to catch fire. Under the fierce power of the "Ryusei" unit, a great chaos was revealed. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy had little strength to engage in fighter combat. The Japanese aircraft squadron returned victoriously. They also attacked the enemy airfield in Fabuba, destroying four enemy aircraft on the ground and severely damaging other facilities. There were no enemy fighters to engage here either. The enemy lost their courage to fight when they saw the "Ryusei" squadron approaching, because the "Ryusei" No. had sharp gun seats installed at the rear, so no matter how the enemy fighters attacked, they would be defeated. On that day, the entire "Ryusei" unit returned to base. Also, a Japanese light bomber squadron followed the "Ryusei" squadron and bombed the enemy airfield in Fabuba at 3:20 am. This surprise attack caught the enemy by surprise. When our light bombers arrived at the destination, it was just when the enemy fighters were preparing to take off and attack the "Ryusei" squadron, and the airfield was like daytime because of the night lights. The Japanese aircraft destroyed the enemy airfield in one fell swoop, causing fires everywhere and achieving great results. All aircraft then leisurely returned to base.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a telegram from New Golden Mountain, the anti-axis side also admitted that the Japanese military operations on the New Guinea front have gradually strengthened recently. The South Pacific anti-axis military headquarters announced on the 28th that the Australian army marching south towards Finshafen had been blocked due to fierce counterattacks by the Japanese army. The resistance of the Japanese army in that area was quite strong, and the anti-axis army attacking from three directions was frustrated and blocked.</p>

They were met with artillery fire from the Japanese side and fled.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 29th telegram: On the morning of the 28th, the enemy again used a large squadron of more than 70 Douglas (SBD) dive bombers and Botseski (TBF) aircraft to attack Corumbanggara Island.

<h3>Japanese Colonel Kurihara Delivered a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a telephone call from Osaka, Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara, director of the Public Relations Department of the Japanese Naval Dispatch Department, gave a speech at the Osaka Nakanoshima Central Public Hall on the night of the 29th, entitled "The Current Stage of the Greater East Asia War." The main points are as follows: The Greater East Asia War has pacified the southern regions. The Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere is a treasure trove. With this treasure trove, it can become the world's largest power. The defense and construction of Greater East Asia will become more and more advantageous to us as time goes by. The desperate counterattacks of Britain and the United States are nothing more than a concern about this point. Supply power and transportation power can determine the current South Pacific war situation. It is not necessary for supply power to be equal to the production volume of the United States. We can win by only producing the amount required by the General Staff Headquarters. Our defense against submarines is gradually strengthening. In July and August, a total of 13 submarines were sunk. The production capacity of the United States is increasing, but there is also a certain limit. During the process of increasing its production capacity, we will crush the US military's counterattack attempts. Then, the time for us to counterattack will come.</p>

We vow to rise up together to cooperate and strive to establish a sure-win economic posture in East Asia, enrich economic combat power, and achieve the mission of the economic community. The 1 billion people of East Asia have been subjected to aggression and continuous economic exploitation by Britain and the United States for 200 years. Now, the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been completely driven out, but Britain and the United States are still making a show of force with their material power and are launching a counterattack. Therefore, we must thoroughly destroy them. This is also the mission of our economic community.

<h3>German Defenses Consolidated on the East Coast of the Adriatic Sea, Italian Rebels Annihilated</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) German authorities announced on the 28th on the defensive measures taken by the German army in the occupied areas of Corfu and the Adriatic coast as follows: The various measures taken by the German army to stabilize the Adriatic Sea have achieved great success in recent days. The General Command has taken rapid and effective measures in the islands of Corfu, which are now under German control, and in Dalmatia, northeastern Italy, and other places on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea. The Italian army under Patrio, stationed on the islands of Corfu, resisted the German landing operation, but the German army overwhelmed it immediately after landing. The remaining part also surrendered in the north of the island. By occupying the islands of Corfu, the German army has secured the Strait of Otranto. The city and port of Split, formerly belonging to Yugoslavia, have also been occupied by the German army. Many bandits who joined Patrio's army have been annihilated, and the main force of Patrio's army, which attempted to escape to the eastern mountainous area, has also been surrounded and annihilated. The mopping-up operation by the German army in Dalmatia and Italian Croatia near the former Austrian Reibach has been strengthened, and powerful units of the Patrio army and bandit groups have been surrounded and defeated.</p>
<h3>German Army in Southern Italy Adopts Elastic Defense Strategy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a report from Haitong News Agency: On the southern Italian front, the German army is still in a dominant position. In the past two years, the anti-axis army has not known when and where the war will break out, only in the western sea 30 to 40 kilometers away. The German front line has remained largely unchanged. On the remaining lines to the Adriatic coast, General Kesselring deliberately made the war tend to be fluid. The fast German rearguard serves as a shield for the advance of the British Eighth Army, from the northwest to the south along the line of Bari, Potenza, Altamura, and its eastern part slightly curves to the north and northwest, placing the entire Foggia Plain outside of it. Therefore, the British Eighth Army is constantly being forced to reorganize, unable to occupy a stronghold in order to concentrate infantry and artillery for a large-scale offensive. As a result, the right wing of the last Eighth Army in the south is now in the far north, while its center and left wing have fallen behind. This is the situation that the British side is most unwilling to see, and the German General Headquarters has deliberately created. Although the enemy may have known that the Salerno area is the key to the front line, the German elastic defense line is smoothly turning north and northwest, but it still does not know whether the shift of the German front line has stopped or will continue to shift. Since the enemy has failed to predict the future development in three-quarters of the southern Italian battlefield, it is increasing pressure again in the remaining one-quarter of the battlefield, namely the Salerno area. The enemy cannot stop the German army's rotation, so it is trying to destroy the key to this rotation. This is why the British and American armies are attacking north of Salerno and in the Besantini Mountains. This offensive has been expanding since the previous day, but there is not much achievement to speak of. As for the central and military units, there are only occasional small encounters. This situation is of most interest to military strategists.</p>
<h3>New Italian Ambassador to Germany, Anfuso, Arrives</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) Prime Minister Mussolini appointed Anfuso as the Italian Ambassador to Germany. Yesterday, Mr. Anfuso arrived in Berlin by plane. The German Foreign Minister sent the head of the Foreign Ministry to represent the welcome. Anfuso is currently the Minister to Hungary and is one of Italy's most capable diplomats. He has also gained the special favor of Mussolini and has participated in many meetings between Germany and Italy. Since Mussolini's rescue, Anbi has expressed his willingness to be directed. Former Ambassador Alfieri participated in the Fascist Congress held on July 25 and voted against Mussolini. He is still in Italy. However, General Beliani, appointed by Patrio as Ambassador to Germany, has never been published by Germany.</p>
<h3>Battles on Both Sides of the Dnieper River; German Troops Prepare Winter Defenses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – News received here last night from the German warfront states that fighting continues on the central eastern bank of the Dnieper River and in a small part of the western bank. The fighting on the western bank is developing due to the crossing of a small number of Soviet troops, and the trend is towards further progress. Soviet forces east of Zhangbo River have renewed their offensive against the German bridgehead, but without any success. Soviet forces massed powerful troops on Sunday, attempting to break through east and southeast of 波羅齊. Although the Soviets used reinforcements newly arrived at the front, their offensive was repelled. A certain Soviet unit attempted to break through the German lines, but the gap has been filled, and the main lines have been re-established. On the central front, the Soviets launched fierce attacks, attempting to disrupt German troop movements, so defensive battles continue fiercely. There are only localized battles in the 古班 bridge area. Soviet transport ships were sunk by the German navy, totaling approximately 2,100 tons.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – A Reuter's dispatch reports that military correspondent Setoris states that the Soviet attempts to repel German forces on the northern and southern flanks of the Zhangbo River front are becoming increasingly obvious. The Soviets are fighting with fresh troops southwest and west of Smolensk, attempting to break through the overall German lines towards Mogilev, but were repelled after fierce fighting. Soviet concentrated attacks on German positions east of 波 and Melitopol were also repelled and suffered heavy losses. The German special reserve troops fought tenaciously. In recent days, the Soviets have failed to achieve their goal of breaking through the German lines between Crimea and the lower Dnieper River. The Dnieper River battle, from Pripyat to the river bend, has largely remained unchanged. The Soviet offensive against the German bridgehead at the river bend has not yet succeeded. Most of the paratroopers who landed west of the Dnieper River over the weekend have been annihilated. The Soviets have been unable to reinforce the bridgehead pioneers who crossed the river, and the positions of the small enemy units on all four banks have been increasingly reduced after the German counterattacks the day before. Only near the mouth of the Pripyat River can the Soviet forces, with a larger number of troops, still stand, but in the swampy areas, there is little possibility of progress.</p>
<h3>Turkey Determined to Safeguard Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity: President İsmet İnönü’s Statement</h3>
<p>Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuter’s dispatch: During his tour of Eastern Anatolia, Turkish President İsmet İnönü delivered a speech to the public in Erzurum, urging them to strive for self-defense with their existing spirit. The President said in his speech in Vilayet, on the Turkish-Soviet border, that Erzurum is an important town in Turkey's eastern frontier and will always be the center of Turkish culture and work. The people of the whole country should do their best to protect it, and so on. Political figures believe this is a statement of Turkey's determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<h3>Mussolini’s Speech Elucidates National Policy Principles; New Constitution Being Drafted</h3>
<p>Rome, 28th (Central News Agency) – At the first cabinet meeting of the new Italian cabinet held here today, Prime Minister Mussolini announced that Italian Fascism and the government are engaged in drafting Italy's new constitution. Mussolini's brief announcement was broadcast by Rome Radio. There were two important measures at the cabinet meeting: one was to dissolve the Senate appointed by the former King Emmanuel, and the other was to approve the relocation of the government away from Rome to preserve the city's undefended status. The name of the new capital has not yet been announced, but it is said to be close to the military headquarters.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th (Central News Agency) – Mussolini, in his capacity as the leader of the Republican Fascist government, delivered a speech last night in Rome to the new cabinet, stating that the new Fascist Republic should seek unity in politics, and the federal administration should concentrate on social problems, and workers will be made responsible for administrative affairs and hold important positions. Italy is now at a critical juncture in its history. Before July 25th, Italy was a country, and its territory, except for the eastern part of Sicily, had not been invaded and occupied. The Italian flag was still flying in 和四嘉 and other places. Now, one-third of the country has been occupied by the enemy, and all Italian overseas positions have been evacuated. This is all due to harsh armistice conditions and cunning. Never before seen in history. The current principles of national policy of the Fascist Republican government are as follows: Fascist Italy will remain loyal to its alliance and continue to fight alongside the German army, doing so calmly, in order to restore Italy's political independence and its position in the world. Although the current situation is extremely serious, it is not hopeless. Work has now begun on reconstruction, and it is hoped that the newly appointed cabinet members will work together to serve the country practically.</p>

<h3>US Army Generals Hold Special Meeting to Review World War Situation</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington: The US Army Department convened a special meeting of domestic front leaders on the 27th. During the meeting, Chief of Staff Marshall and other Army generals gave detailed information on the recent war situation. After the meeting, the main points of the reports of the three generals were published as follows: General 巴德森 said that the coming year will be the most dangerous period in American history. Although the United States has experienced various difficulties since the start of the war, the greatest difficulties are only now beginning. He recently inspected the front lines of the Pacific theater and asked General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Southwest Pacific, what was most needed at the moment. He replied, "Only aircraft are essential," so he believes that a large number of aircraft must be transported to the front line as much as possible. Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, General 马库维屈, said: Germany now seems to have shifted its aircraft production target from bombers to fighters, which indicates that Germany's combat goal has changed to defense. Germany's defensive posture will therefore become more advantageous. The Anti-Axis forces are determined to promote the progress of the battle, which will be the main cause of disaster. General 斯條古, the director of the Army Intelligence Department, said: Germany's labor force is not slightly weaker than it was four years ago, and the strength of the German army is three times that when it invaded Poland. In addition, Japan's resources are also quite abundant, the morale of the army and the general public have not wavered, and it occupies a geographically advantageous strategic position.</p>
<p>Montgomery Encounters Difficulties</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the British capital: Londoners all agree that Lord Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command is encountering unprecedented difficulties. These people point out that the political disputes are centered on three themes: the Chongqing battlefield led by Chiang Kai-shek, the western Pacific battlefield led by MacArthur, and the internal situation in India. It is said that since Montgomery's headquarters was first established in New Delhi, India is naturally the basic base for the war against Japan. The most serious and complex situation Montgomery's command is encountering is the result of India's political and economic situation. Montgomery's task is to obtain supplies and manpower from India to launch an offensive, but India is now politically unstable and suffering from a major famine. Although India's political problems are handled by the newly appointed Viceroy Wavell, and the military problems are the responsibility of General Auchinleck, these are not Mountbatten's affairs, but it is difficult to launch a large-scale offensive without first considering the impact of these problems. It is said that Montgomery believes that if he wants to implement a planned offensive against the Japanese positions in Burma, he must first rebuild the Burma Road. In the past nine months, American engineers have supervised black Indian and Chongqing laborers to build the "Second Burma Road" for the use of the Anti-Axis forces. The road has now started from the northeast of India and is said to connect with the old Burma Road somewhere between Chongqing and Lashio. The road construction is very difficult, so the progress is very slow, and only a few meters of mud can be removed every day. Workers are often plagued by malaria and other tropical diseases, and are threatened by wind, rain, and landslides.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Japan's Wartime Economy; Resources and Finances Are More Than Adequate</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The current war can be said to be a war of materials and money, so Japan's economic strength during the Greater East Asia War is of great concern to the world. The following is a brief introduction to the general situation of Japan's economic fears: Japan's military expenditure in the Sino-Japanese War was 200 million yuan, and it increased several times in the Russo-Japanese War to 1.51 billion yuan. However, in the current Greater East Asia War, Japan's war expenditure has reached 470 billion yuan. In terms of Japan's financial resources, public debt income and borrowing accounted for 58.26% of the total amount in the Sino-Japanese War, 97.67% in the Russo-Japanese War, and 76.89% in the Greater East Asia War. However, the war expenditure of the Greater East Asia War was not based on foreign prices, but was planned entirely with domestic funds. The following is a comparison of Japan's national income with that of the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1942, Japan's national income was 45 billion yen, the United Kingdom's was 16 billion pounds, and the United States' was 117 billion US dollars. The military expenditure of Japan in the same year was 18 billion yen, the United Kingdom's was 4.5 billion pounds, and the United States' was 77 billion US dollars. The amount of the Japanese problem is relatively small. However, in terms of the ratio of national income to military expenditure, Japan is 40%, the United Kingdom is 60%, and the United States is 64%. It is obvious that Japan's national income has a surplus of 20% more than that of the United Kingdom and the United States. In terms of the tax revenue of each country, from 1943 to 1944, Japan's tax revenue was 8.6911 billion yuan, the United Kingdom's was 2.91 billion pounds, and the United States' was 91 billion US dollars. The burden per citizen in Japan was 118.30 yuan, in the United Kingdom it was 67 pounds (equivalent to 1,040.40 Japanese yen), and in the United States it was 317.80 US dollars (equivalent to 1,655.60 Japanese yen).</p>
<p>The burden per Japanese citizen</p>
<p>Only accounts for 11% of the burden of each British citizen and 7% of the burden of each American citizen. To sum up the above figures, although Japan's finances are smaller in scale than those of the United States, its resources are more than adequate. If Japan has fully utilized this point to exert its power, it has achieved brilliant results since the Greater East Asia War. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States rely solely on huge numbers to control themselves, and increase the burden on their citizens. In particular, the taxpaying power of American citizens has reached its limit. Senator George, the chairman of the Senate Revenue Committee, explained the tax increase problem half a month ago, saying that the US government requires a tax increase of 12 billion US dollars this year, but in reality, it may be reduced by 3 billion to 5 billion US dollars, because the current income tax rate has reached a considerable height in the past, so it is difficult to increase it further. It is estimated that the total annual war expenditure for next year will reach 90 billion US dollars, a slight decrease from the 100 billion US dollars this year. This implies that the wartime finances of the United States have begun to show cracks.</p>

<p>Minister Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): To make the general public understand the significance of collecting radio broadcasting fees, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department gave a special speech, the text of which is recorded below: In addition to bearing the important mission of promoting government policies, the broadcasting industry also makes great contributions to the public's knowledge cultivation and spiritual nourishment. The development of this industry depends on the government's overall support and assistance, but even more so on the love and cooperation of compatriots across the country. The broadcasting industries of advanced countries mostly rely on radio listening fees for operation and development. Our friendly neighbor Japan has long implemented the collection of listening fees with remarkable results, and many other countries also have similar methods. Since the establishment of the China Broadcasting Association, China's broadcasting industry has relied on the cooperation of friendly Japan, and the foundation in terms of economic resources and management has been continuously established. However, there is still a regret that the collection of listening fees has not yet been implemented. In order to adapt to the needs of wartime broadcasting, and to promote the improvement of broadcasting equipment and programs, and the widespread availability of radio manufacturing and supply, the government should strengthen cooperation with friendly countries and promote the high-level development of the broadcasting industry. The people nationwide should deeply recognize the sacred mission of the broadcasting industry and enthusiastically support the government's broadcasting policies. The collection of listening fees is not only beneficial to the future of the broadcasting industry, but also of great significance in guaranteeing the legitimate broadcasting interests of the people nationwide. Recently, this department drafted the "Provisional Measures for Installing Wireless Radios for Listening to Broadcasts," which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. According to the provisions of these provisional measures, anyone who registers a wireless radio must apply to the government for a permit and sign a listening agreement with the China Broadcasting Association, paying a monthly listening fee of ten yuan in national currency. However, for the convenience of implementation, starting from October 1st, collection will begin first in Nanjing and Shanghai. All matters related to radio installation permits, fee collection, and inspection will be entrusted to the China Broadcasting Association. Implementation in other areas will be postponed. From this day forward, the "Provisional Measures for Installing Wireless Radios for Listening to Broadcasts" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, this department's order announcing the effective date of these provisional measures, and the measures for entrusting the China Broadcasting Association to handle wireless radio installation permits and other matters will be published in various newspapers. All radio users in Beijing and Shanghai should pay attention to the matters to be handled, which are specified in the respective measures and orders. This matter concerns the promotion of the national broadcasting industry and the protection of the people's listening to broadcasts. The monthly cost to each individual is minimal, but by accumulating small amounts, the broadcasting equipment can be enriched, and the broadcasting programs can be improved. It is believed that the people will be happy to cooperate and contribute to the public good.</p>

<h3>Grain Control Committee to Purchase Rice; Implementation Begins Next Month; October Rice Rations Distributed by Original Agencies</h3>
<p>Since the Grain Control Committee was actively prepared, the internal organization of one secretariat, four sections, four offices, and thirteen sub-sections has been fully completed. From October 1st, it can begin full-scale operations in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The committee's future work on grain control and purchase will be advanced step-by-step according to the established grain purchase plan. According to a Central News Agency reporter's investigation, the committee's work on purchasing rice will begin in early next month, purchased by the Rice Purchasing Trade Association composed of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special municipal districts of Nanjing and Shanghai, in preparation for the need for rice rations in November. As for the rice rations needed by the Shanghai urban area in October, more than 160,000 bags have already been purchased by the original grain management agencies and distributed to the first and other districts, as well as to the southwestern cotton cloth and other household rice rations. Whether the quantity of household rice will be increased is currently uncertain. In general, the problem of civilian food can be solved under the new system of rice and grain control. It is also understood that the joint operation of rice and grain cooperatives in various regions has ended since the 20th of this month. All files have been transferred to the Grain Control Committee for receipt.</p>
<p>Close Consideration of Purchase Funds</p>
<p>The Grain Control Committee, which is responsible by the Executive Yuan for promoting the new plan for the production and sales of rice and grain, has been publishing the "Essential Guidelines for the Establishment of Rice Purchase Trade Associations." Since the Ministry of Food and the Japanese military authorities have respectively issued statements expressing their support, rice merchants from the three provinces have been enthusiastically applying to participate in the conference. Concrete methods and implementation details are being carefully studied. As for the quantity of rice and grain purchased and the amount of funds, the attention paid to this is greater than to anything else. In particular, the price of rice and grain should be considered as necessary under the principle of maintaining the most appropriate standard. Various relevant plans are being carefully discussed with all parties by the Grain Control Committee. Regardless of whether there is any degree of determination, the timing of its implementation must still be thoroughly selected.</p>
<h3>After Air Raid Alerts Are Issued, Office Work Should Proceed as Usual; Employees Should Perform Their Duties and Not Leave Without Authorization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the public's air defense installations and the development of skills have gradually become proficient. In order to further improve the city's air defense measures, it has specially ordered all bureaus, departments, and associations under its jurisdiction to continue to work as usual in their original locations after air raid alerts are issued during office hours. Each shall perform their duties and not leave their posts without authorization, and must wait until the air raid alert is lifted before they can leave work. All should take heed and not disregard this.</p>
<h3>Investigation in District One: Artesian Wells</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency dispatch: In order to strengthen the necessary measures for air defense and firefighting, the Baojia offices in various Baojia districts in the First District have recently notified each Bao to submit detailed reports on the location, water flow, and installation style of each artesian well (or earth well) within the Bao within the recent period. It is reported by the Standing Bureau for statistics. According to a reporter's investigation, the Baojia offices have already handled this order and relayed the order to each Jia, and the Jia heads are actively investigating and reporting the artesian wells (or earth wells) in their respective Jia. The situation also applies to those belonging to private individuals, but the name and household number of the owner of the well must be noted so that the authorities can borrow it from them when necessary.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Training for Police Officers in District One</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency dispatch: The six-day air defense training, lectures, and exercises of the First Police Bureau, which began on Monday, concluded its first part of the program yesterday (29th). The venue was inside the First Police Bureau. Starting today (30th), the first day of air defense exercises will begin at the Hongkou Fire Training Association. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the First Police Bureau gave those who attended the lectures the opportunity to ask questions about air defense issues, and at the same time summarized the latest air defense methods that were discussed in the previous two days. Mr. Ogawa, the director of air defense supervision, attended to answer various questions, so that the police officers could understand the various measures to be taken during emergency air defense periods.</p>
<h3>Rice Ration Coupons to Be Issued Today</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency says that the rice ration coupons for the 48th period and the rice flour procurement materials can be issued today, and payments can be made tomorrow to exchange for warehouse receipts to pick up the rice, which can be sold within days. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the rice rations for this period are still allocated by the Central China Rice and Grain Allocation Association.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Tickets to Ningbo Discovered; China Navigation Company Retakes Direct Sales</h3>
<p>The Wansheng and Wanji ships of the China Navigation Company, which travel the Shanghai-Ningbo line, have had their tickets sold by travel agencies commissioned by the company. This has often led to various malpractices, and ship tickets have also appeared on the black market, causing difficulties for travelers. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, the China Navigation Company has now decided to directly sell first, second, and third class (i.e., large dining room cabins) tickets through the Shanghai branch starting tomorrow (1st). Fourth class (i.e., general cabins) tickets are sold at the ticket booth at No. 6, the Bund, in the company's First District. As for the transportation of goods, it will also be handled directly by the company's Shanghai branch.</p>

<h3>The School for the Unfortunate - A Record of the Blind Children's School (3)</h3>
<p>Admirable Life</p>
<p>The Blind Children's School resembles a military camp with its organization, discipline, and spirit; it also resembles a large family filled with the natural love between parents, children, siblings. The faculty and staff certainly regard each class of students as their own children, and the male and female students rely on the faculty and staff as their parents, elder brothers, and elder sisters. The founder, Dr. Fou Kwan-nga, passed away long ago, and the old principal and his capable assistant, Mr. and Mrs. Chuan Bu-kai, have now also left their positions, but their concern and care for the teachers and students of the school are probably even more earnest than before. The current principal, Wang Shu-shi, is a philanthropist enthusiastic about the education of the blind and deaf, and the vice-principal, He Zhi-zeng (Zi-jian), is an old "family member" who has served in the school for twenty-nine years. The half-blind Dean of Studies, Fan Fu-bao, has served for more than twenty years, and the talented blind music director, Chang Lie-qing, has also served for more than twenty-seven years. Others, such as Zheng Yi-ru and several blind teachers, have a service history of one or two decades and have made teaching and nurturing blind students into talented individuals their lifelong career. This is completely different from the high turnover rate of faculty and staff in general schools.</p>
<p>The good relationship between teachers and students is not only due to the length of time they spend together, but also to the understanding of each other's personalities. In ordinary schools, each grade or class often has dozens of students, and teachers often cannot know the names of all the students. The turnover rate is also high, so there is no talk of teacher-student affection. However, in the blind school, each class has at most ten students. Usually, boys and girls work and play in separate groups. The need for mutual reliance between teachers and students and among students is extremely high, and the understanding and recognition of each other is also more genuine. Not only in teaching but also in daily life, a new family is formed.</p>
<p>The Blind Children's School places equal emphasis on education and upbringing of students. Although there are only 97 male and female students in total (one-quarter were sent by the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section, one-third are older students, and only four pay tuition, and four or five have someone specifically donating for their tuition), in order to ensure the perfection of education and upbringing, the number of teaching staff cannot be too small. There are currently eight people, and they are really busy to the point of being unable to breathe. Also, because the school is too far from the city center and transportation is inconvenient, it cannot accommodate day students. All students board at the school, so special care is taken in daily life. Each dormitory has a supervisor. Needless to say, the dormitories for boys and girls in grades five and six to junior high school are very clean. Ms. Zhang Hua, the nanny and management officer, led [us] to see the dormitories of the first and second-grade blind students under her charge. Ms. Ye Zhong-hua led [us] to see the dormitory of the female students under her charge, and they were all tidied up and beautified. In addition, the building and other aspects are particularly emphasized. Each room has windows on three sides, fitted with beautiful curtains. Outside the curtains is a grove of trees that can be turned on and off. The interior is uniformly furnished with iron beds, white blankets, and white quilts, folded neatly and evenly. The floor is as smooth as if it had been waxed in the sky. This should be the ideal bedroom for the luckiest people!</p>
<p>The daily lives of the students are regulated. After getting up early in the morning to clean, they go to the sports ground for appropriate exercise. Do not guess that educators cannot do group exercises or collective sports. Unexpectedly, both male and female blind children love sports, especially group sports. They even participated in the Jiangsu Provincial School Joint Sports Meet and won a certificate for excellent group sports performance!</p>
<p>Outside of class, some blind children are resting and chatting, and some are walking in the grove, but the music room and the library are never too deserted. Therefore, the school often overflows with harmonious piano sounds. The library's collection of books can truly be considered magnificent. Most of them are books, tools, charts, and histories specially designed for educators. There is also a relatively new type of Braille, which is shorthand and also raised letters printed on special paper, specifically for older blind people with weaker memory. There are also many musical scores for the blind. Many people are truly "studying them carefully," because only after studying them thoroughly can they be transferred to musical instruments. Blind people cannot perform by reading music!</p>
<p>The Future of Blind Children's Education</p>
<p>The impression that the Blind Children's School gives is so beautiful and admirable! However, the superficial grandeur ultimately cannot conceal the internal panic and difficulties!</p>
<p>Of course, the most important issue at present is the funding issue. In peacetime, it has always relied on donations from all walks of life. It has been operating miserably for several years, but the internal situation is extremely difficult, because the original sources of funding have been completely cut off, and prices are constantly soaring, but expenses cannot be controlled! Teachers bear heavy responsibilities and have many tasks, but the monthly salary is at most only two hundred and fifty yuan, and the ten workers receive only fifty to seventy yuan. The words "sacrificial service" can be applied to them without shame. However, other expenses cannot be saved! According to a statistic from the school in the first semester of this year, the total expenditure was 356,174.82 yuan, of which food alone accounted for 295,827 yuan. It can be said that this is the biggest difficulty at present. In reality, all teachers and students in the school eat only three meals of porridge a day, so the reason why such a large amount of money is spent is: (1) The school's address is between the outer security zone and the "purification zone," and there is no household ration of rice. All rice must be purchased at high prices on the black market; (2) 400 bags of donated crushed wheat were stored last year and have already been eaten. Someone said that the most urgent thing at present is the grain problem. If the authorities allow special households to be rationed rice, then the problem can be solved for the most part. Secondly, any material assistance is also highly anticipated, such as books and paper for the blind, which are now completely unavailable. They have switched to using old magazines (thick paper) to print Braille and compile textbooks. They hope that all walks of life will donate these old books and magazines. Now they only seek to maintain this only large-scale blind education and training undertaking in China, and are preparing to restore crafts, printing, newspapers and other departments in the near future, to become the leader of the national blind education and training movement, and to build a free and happy new world for the unfortunate blind men and women in the country. The realization of this ideal is awaiting the assistance of truly enthusiastic philanthropists in society (End)</p>
<h3>Eight District Finance Office Strictly Prohibits Impersonation</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: The Finance Office of the Eighth District Public Office issued a notice stating that investigators of the Finance Office must carry the investigation certificate issued by the office in order to perform their duties outside. This has already been announced. However, it has been reported that recently some people have been impersonating Finance Office staff members outside, which is illegal and extremely bad. In addition to ordering the Third Police Station to pay attention to this at all times, all merchants and people are requested to ask for the investigation certificate from Finance Office staff members when they perform investigation duties. If there is no investigation certificate to prove their identity, they should immediately be sent to the nearest police station for custody and report to this office for investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Central Market Vegetable Price Evaluation</h3>

<h3>Shop Illegally Profiteering - Subject to Suspension</h3>
<p>The Economic Office of the First District Public Office of the Special Municipality has strictly managed the selling prices of shops in various industries by assessing and setting price limits, and has sent people to secretly investigate. If there are cases of exceeding the price limits, they are often investigated and punished with suspension of business. Previously, Huali Store at No. 239, Gongping Road, and Helai Tobacco Store at No. 167, Shandong Road, violated the economic regulations of the office and were subject to suspension. They were officially sealed by the First Police Station after the Economic Office requested them the day before yesterday. The former was suspended for three days, and the latter was suspended for five days. The sealing report stated: "After investigating that the store violated the economic regulations of this office, it is ordered to suspend business for several days. If citizens discover hoarding, speculation, illegal profiteering, and other violations of the regulations of the Economic Office of this office, they should immediately report to the Economic Office of this office for investigation and handling."</p>
<h3>Salt Still Not Universally Sold - Eagerly Awaiting Prompt Sale</h3>
<p>The supply of salt has not yet been universally available, and ordinary consumers have no choice but to turn to the black market to purchase it at high prices, which has a significant impact on daily expenses. It is understood that the salt reserves in this city are still very abundant and there is no need to worry about the interruption of supply. However, it is still impossible to purchase it at a fair price. The salt administration authorities are probably conducting thorough research. All residents of the city are eagerly awaiting prompt universal sale to benefit the people's livelihood. Awaiting prompt universal sale to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>Those Who Install Wireless Radios Must Conclude Listening Contracts Starting Today and Pay a Monthly Listening Fee of Ten Yuan - Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Notifies Japanese Residents to Comply</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: The Ministry of Propaganda has announced the implementation of a licensing system for the installation of radios and has authorized the China Broadcasting Association to conclude listening contracts with radio owners starting October 1st and collect a monthly listening fee of ten yuan. The implementation area is temporarily limited to the two special cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, and then gradually expanded to general areas. In addition, North China implemented the same measures as early as June last year, and Japanese residents in the area also paid the listening fee. Central China will also take the same measures. The Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai issued Notice No. 39 on the 29th, and the Consulate-General authorities issued a statement. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>Within the special area of Shanghai, those who have wireless radios installed for the purpose of listening to radio broadcasts should conclude a listening contract with the China Broadcasting Association, a financial organization, during the period from October 1st to October 14th. Those who wish to install new radios from October 1st onwards should conclude the above contract before installation. September 29th, Showa 18th year. Yano Seiki, Consul-General in Shanghai</p>
<p>Statement</p>
<p>The Japanese Consulate-General authorities also issued a statement saying: The National Government authorities have announced the implementation of a licensing system for the installation of radios by the Ministry of Propaganda this time. At the same time, they have authorized the Broadcasting Association to collect a monthly listening fee of ten yuan from those who install wireless radios. The implementation will begin on October 1st, and the implementation area will be the Shanghai and Nanjing special city areas. In the future, it will gradually expand to other areas. The Broadcasting Association is a financial cooperative organization that is not for profit. All listening fees are used to enrich and improve the broadcasting business. It goes without saying that the broadcasting business has a major mission in the ideological war and cultural war during wartime. In order to actively assist the Association in completing its mission, the Japanese side believes that Japanese residents in the Shanghai special city area should also bear this listening fee. The Consulate has separately stipulated in Notice No. 39 of this Consulate that listening contracts should be concluded. North China implemented a licensing system for the installation of wireless radios and collected a listening fee in May last year. Local Japanese residents also pay the listening fee. Those who currently hold wireless radios in the area designated in this notice should conclude a listening contract with the Broadcasting Association during the period from October 1st to October 14th and must not miss this. Also, those who wish to install new wireless radios from October 1st onwards should first conclude a contract before installation, and be sure to comply with the contract contents one by one. Also, if there are those who avoid concluding a contract or do not comply with the contract contents, they will be subject to appropriate punishment.</p>

The war dates are set for the 4th (Monday), 6th (Wednesday), and 11th (Monday) of next month, at the Bailemen Stadium. Qianghua is a nickname for Bailemen, while the mixed team brings together Li Zhen-zhong, Bao Song-yuan, Chen Xue-chong, Li Zu-de, and other top players in Shanghai.

<h3>Hua Shang Securities Exchange Held Reopening Ceremony Yesterday; Trading Expected to Begin Around the Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hua Shang Securities Exchange, since receiving orders from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to prepare for its reopening, has completed all necessary facilities. It is tentatively scheduled to officially begin trading on the 10th of October. In case preparations are slightly delayed, it will only be postponed for about two days until around the Double Tenth Festival. Therefore, the exchange held a reopening ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 29th). It is estimated that representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, various government agencies, as well as financial and industrial guests attending the ceremony numbered no fewer than four to five hundred. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives of Guests Attending the Ceremony</p>
<p>Representatives from various government agencies included Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry, Director Zhang Jun of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, Director Chen Zhong of the Bureau of Commodity Inspection, Director Xiang Xun of the Bureau of Trademarks, Director Sun Zuji of the Insurance Management Bureau, Director Li Cheng of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, Director Chen Riping of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office, various supervisory committee members, and prominent figures from the financial and industrial sectors such as Wen Kai, Ting Linkang, Hou Pan, Yang Yao, Wu Yunqi, Xu Guanqun, and Jin Zongcheng.</p>
<p>Report on the Progress of Preparing for Reopening</p>
<p>After Chairman Zhang Weiru delivered the opening remarks, he reported on the progress of preparing for the reopening. He mentioned that the exchange had been closed for more than six years since the incident. This reopening was not a simple matter. Between February and March of this year, over one hundred securities firms were sanctioned by the former Municipal Council due to unfair trading practices that violated regulations. After two months, the necessity of an exchange became apparent. Later, the government, recognizing Shanghai as the economic center of the country, believed that an exchange was indispensable for circulating securities and adjusting finances under the wartime economic system. Furthermore, since the exchange had been established in Shanghai for about twenty years, it had made considerable achievements for society. Based on this historical relationship, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry jointly issued an order in July to reopen the exchange. After the shareholders' meeting on July 24th, preparations were actively undertaken. However, the exchange bears a significant mission and must handle matters cautiously. Therefore, it has taken until now to be substantially ready. Today's reopening ceremony marks the imminent official opening. He requested everyone's guidance to correct any shortcomings.</p>
<p>Instructional Remarks by Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Vice Minister Yuan delivered instructional remarks, stating that under the current wartime economic system, the national policy adopts economic control. Under normal circumstances, it seems contradictory to use the principle of free trade, making the reopening of the exchange unnecessary. However, the government believes that various economic controls, except for those with a significant relationship to national policy, need not apply to the securities trading of the people. Furthermore, recognizing that securities circulation has an impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood and is an indispensable institution for finance, the government ordered the reopening of the exchange in July of this year. However, since the government has adopted a national controlled economic policy, it should apply appropriate supervision and intervention to the future operations of the exchange, making it different from the previous exchange. Moreover, the previous exchange specialized in government bonds, while now it mainly deals in stocks. With the development of stocks, it is hoped that there will be a formal exchange to oversee and prevent other malpractices.</p>
<p>Instructional Remarks by Representative Li Cheng of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Director Li, representative of the Ministry of Finance, stated that the primary task of business is to engage in trading and comply with the law. All rules and regulations must be meticulously stipulated and consistently adhered to. On one hand, it can guide idle funds into the right track, supporting the development of various industrial and commercial enterprises; on the other hand, it can smooth the circulation of funds and stabilize finance, benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood. The reopening of the exchange to engage in legitimate transactions is expected to be even more active than before, which is greatly anticipated.</p>
<p>Remarks by Guest Representative Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, delivered congratulatory remarks on behalf of the guests, stating that the reopening of the exchange today is like the restoration of a railway destroyed after the incident, which has been well-managed by the government. In the future, all business will be on track. In this extraordinary period, it is hoped that the exchange and its brokers will take their business as their responsibility and not focus solely on profits.</p>
<p>Official Trading to Begin in Early Next Month</p>
<p>Finally, when reporters inquired with Chairman Zhang of the exchange, he stated that the number of confirmed brokers at the exchange is 200, with a security deposit of 500,000 yuan required from each broker. Various title deeds, securities, bank deposit slips, and bank guarantees are accepted as collateral. Currently, the number of listed stocks for trading exceeds 160. It was originally intended to implement trading immediately, but due to incomplete installation of brokers' telephone lines and the need for the Supervisory Committee to review and approve the names of listed stocks, the official start of trading will be delayed until around October 10th (the current tentative date for opening is October 8th, but this is not fully confirmed). The trading rules specify spot transactions with settlements every seven days. The primary securities for trading will be shares of cotton mills, banks, and other securities, but only those that have been approved by the government, registered, and obtained a business license will be traded. Trading hours will be from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM for opening and closing sessions.</p>
<h3>Economic Department Holds a Symposium on the Sauce Industry</h3>
<p>The Economic Group Management Section of the Economic Department of the First District of Shanghai Special Municipality, in order to connect with various industries, investigate prices, and discuss various issues, has been convening symposiums for the persons in charge of various industries since this month to exchange opinions, thereby stabilizing people's livelihood. This afternoon (the 30th) at 3:00 PM, at the conference room of the department, representatives from the sauce industry, the seasoning powder manufacturing industry, the seasoning sauce industry, and the guild will be gathered to discuss the production and sales of soy sauce, seasoning sauces, and other matters in detail.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Two Resolutions Passed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Among the various important resolutions passed by the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce at its annual member representative conference, two are particularly worthy of everyone's support: one is that silk and silk products should be allowed to be freely transported, and the other is that the price deposit slips for yarn and cloth should be discounted without interest. The former is a request for the implementation of government orders, and the latter is a request for the remedy of government orders, and the expression of their meaning is consistent with what has been expressed in this newspaper's editorial. We have emphasized regarding local administration that there should not be different political facilities within the same jurisdiction; we have frankly expressed that there may have been insufficient consideration in advance for the purchase of yarn and cloth, so subsequent remedies are necessary.</p>
<p>In terms of the free transportation of silk and silk products, it is clearly based on the "Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement" and the "General Rules for the Registration of Essential Commodities," which are beyond doubt. Moreover, the highest authority for material control—the National General Association for Commercial Control—has already informed the Silk Industry Association that the movement of silk cocoons, silk fabrics, and silk textiles within the three provinces and two cities or within the province does not require permission from the association, according to the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement. Therefore, the competent authorities in other regions, even within their jurisdiction, seem to be able only to follow the current central laws and regulations and cannot create their own.</p>
<p>In terms of the interest-free discounting of price deposit slips for yarn and cloth, although we cannot determine how the central government will respond to the request for interest-free discounting, we still advocate that financial assistance, no matter what form it takes, is absolutely necessary in the purchase of yarn and cloth today. All firms have a duty to perform this responsibility, but the cooperation of the firms still relies on the Central Reserve Bank to act as their most powerful backing in its position as the "bank of banks."</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the generally upward trend suddenly declined sharply. The downward trend continued in the afternoon. Around 3:00 PM, it suddenly turned upward again. In the end, most stocks returned to their previous gains, though slightly less. The trading volume was brisk. The trends in various industries are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Textiles: Yong'an Textile's new shares opened high. After opening in the morning, they soared. Around 10:00 AM, sell orders flooded in. In the afternoon, they once fell close to a level only half a grade away from a loss. Finally, they rose again. The price of old shares also saw an increase. Dasheng One, Three, and Two Mills also rose. Zhongfang's losses were covered. Jiangya and Xinnuo rose sharply but ultimately declined slightly. Rongfeng Textile was firm due to news of capital increase. Small denomination Dagong Dyeing and Weaving shares exceeded their face value by 80%.

Xinxin's losses were immediately evident after opening in the morning, but later recovered slightly. The fluctuations in Jianhuo were narrow, and the decline was small. China Underwear rose sharply but also saw a decline, with the greatest change on the day, ranging over × points.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals: Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory initially rose significantly. Around noon, it fluctuated around × points. It declined in the afternoon.

Bao'an Glass, Dahua Planting, and Sanyou Industrial were all stable. Standard Paper Products attracted buyers.</p>
<h3>Commercial News Summary</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday suddenly turned soft and weak, with a relatively severe trend. Category C initially saw good market conditions, but later due to unfavorable circumstances, the result was a significant decline. Categories A, B, D, and E also fell across the board.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1%.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: The arrival of rice in the market was scarce, and trading was slow and unenthusiastic. Scattered households had limited holdings, but public sentiment was upward, and the market rose gradually. Soybean cake and corn arrivals were scarce, and prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Tea: Trading remained sparse. However, public sentiment against the grain showed signs of improvement. Even though trading was quiet, the market situation gradually shifted from stagnant to stable and promising. The entire city saw only Wan Sheng Tea House take in ten boxes of black tea, with a transaction price of over customs per dan, according to Yong Shun Tea House. There were no transactions for other varieties.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics: The downward trend of fine wool fabrics has come to a halt. The existing stock in the city's factories and stores is limited. Production has only decreased and not increased. Based on the recent market prices, the total costs have exceeded the new costs. In the past month, Tongle and other stores have been selling off fine wool fabrics at low prices. Medium-grade Chinese clothing and four-piece suits have been sold in real terms, and approximately tens of thousands of yards have been sold by breaking them down into smaller lots.</p>
<h3>Another Letter to the Business and Industrial Circles</h3>
<p>To all gentlemen in the business and industrial circles:</p>
<p>Our newspaper, in view of the many changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce in recent years, plans to compile a "Shanghai Industry and Commerce Directory" to facilitate inspection and reference. We have received information from various industry associations. We recently sent an open letter to the gentlemen in the business and industrial circles, requesting them to provide accurate survey data. In recent days, we have received letters from various companies and factories, detailing the contents, which we greatly appreciate. In order to further broaden the survey, we have specially made a form (the form is shown on page two of this newspaper on September 20th; if you need a letter or a form, you can request it). We hope that gentlemen in the business and industrial circles will fill out the form in detail according to the items and send it to us so that it can be corrected during printing. Whether you have joined an association or not, regardless of the size of your capital or the scope of your business, all Shanghai industrialists and businessmen are welcome.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shen Bao</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Funding for Cloth Factories; Petitioning the Authorities for Relief</h3>
<p>Cloth factories in this city have experienced some difficulties in the turnover of funds due to the government's explicit order to purchase yarn and cloth. Therefore, they plan to request relief from the authorities and allow the special fixed-term deposit slips for yarn and cloth to be discounted. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the fabric factory industry, will submit a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, detailing the difficult situation of various industries after the purchase of yarn and cloth, and requesting financial relief. The reasons for the cloth factories' request to be forwarded by the Chamber of Commerce are recorded below: "It is found that most of our country's industries and businesses have meager financial resources. Most of the capital, in addition to being used for machinery and equipment, is used for working capital. Therefore, taking the cloth factory industry as an example, almost all of the industry are debtors to banks. Since the government promulgated the explicit order to purchase yarn and cloth, the banks have uniformly stopped lending and urged repayment. In particular, repayments are frequently requested for maturing loans, which is extremely urgent. The government's payment for the purchase of yarn and cloth is subject to the regulations and is scheduled to take as long as three years. The distant water cannot quench the present thirst, and there is suffering in having to cope with this. As a result, the turnover of funds in various factories is inflexible, and production facilities are on the verge of bankruptcy. It is known that the recent payment for the purchase of yarn and cloth must wait three months. During this period, the daily expenses and workers' salaries of the various factories will be impossible to pay. It is common to hear that factory owners are pawning their clothes to maintain the workers' food. These difficulties that have occurred in reality were not anticipated by the authorities when they initially purchased the yarn and cloth. It seems that they are not fully in line with the economic national policy of maintaining production facilities and promoting increased production. Although the various musical guilds have petitioned the Executive Yuan for relief, there has been no clear approval. Our Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the leading organization in Shanghai's industry and commerce. At this time, the crisis of the yarn and cloth production and sales industries is pressing. The attending representatives have great foresight and will certainly help resolve difficulties and stabilize finance. Therefore, we dare to request that the competent authorities be approached with relief and allow the special fixed-term deposit slips to be discounted and the interest to be exempted, so as to use them for circulation, so that the production facilities still have a chance to survive and can fulfill their inherent responsibilities."</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Various Industry Associations</h3>
<p>Liquor: After the Shanghai Municipal Liquor Retail Industry Association was approved by the Municipal Grain Bureau and formally announced its establishment, the Grain Bureau ordered the old seals of the association to be handed over for cancellation, and the new seals have now been put into use. Other similar associations in the city should all cease their activities.</p>
<p>Ramie Products Industry: The Commercial Control Association has long listed hemp and its ramie products as important controlled materials. Since the Japanese side already has the organization of the Ramie Industry Federation, it was previously requested from the Ministry of Industry to check whether the Chinese side should be allowed to establish a similar organization. The Ministry of Industry replied that ramie is indeed an important material. According to the industry association, there are more than 300 companies in Shanghai, and there are many other companies in Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. The Ramie Industry Federation should be allowed to be added to unify the distribution and facilitate supervision and management.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>China Sewing Machine Factory was founded in the autumn of the 31st year, specializing in the manufacture of various sewing machines, comparable to imported products. Its product, the Model 1001 electric sewing machine (the same as the Singer Company's 95 sewing machine), is especially known to various weaving factories and companies.</p>
<h3>City Government to Hold a Food Production Forum Today to Discuss Wartime Food Production</h3>
<p>Since the city's food agency was adjusted by the City Food Bureau in accordance with the regulations of the City Government and the Ministry of Grain, it has now fully complied with the wartime organization. The municipal authorities, in order to actively increase food production, use resources to increase people's food supply, and revive the prosperity of rural areas, have scheduled to hold a city food production forum at 6:00 PM today (the 30th) in the City Government Auditorium. The City Food Bureau has already issued notices in advance, and all relevant district governments, agricultural improvement zones, and agricultural and forestry experiment stations are expected to attend on time in order to jointly explore solutions to increase food production.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Arrives</h3>
<p>This year's cotton crop was affected by strong winds during the flowering period, so the yield is not abundant. In addition, farmers in the interior are less motivated to grow cotton because grain prices are high and cotton profits are low. Therefore, the planting area is not as large as in the past. In the past week, new cotton has arrived in the suburbs of Nanjing and in Changshu, Taicang, Jiangyin, Sha, and other places. Due to limited planting in the suburbs of Nanjing, the harvest is less than last year. Changshu, Taicang, Jiangyin, Changyinsha, and other places, which are cotton-producing areas, have a relatively abundant yield this year. As for the current price of new cotton, it has declined due to the purchase of yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3>Two Years After the Start of the War: The Political Power of the Soviet Union – Analysis of Soviet War Potential, Part 2</h3>
<p>Two years after the start of the German-Soviet war, no one can deny that Stalin's regime is not only unshaken, but has become even stronger. It used to be said that the collapse of the Stalin regime would mean the end of the Soviet Union, and the collapse of the Soviet Union would mean the demise of the Stalin regime. This relationship has become even closer since the start of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>As for Stalin himself, he has recently not only been promoted to Marshal, further strengthening his position as the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, but also concurrently serves as Chairman of the State Defense Committee, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, People's Commissar of Defense, and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, holding the most important positions in wartime Soviet Union, wielding supreme command over both military and political affairs.</p>
<p>Especially since the first and second winter counter-offensives, Stalin's guidance of the Soviet Army's counter-offensive and the recovery of many lost territories occupied by the German army have led to a growing faith in Stalin among the people. "Motherland" and "Stalin" can be said to be synonymous, and "For Stalin" and "For the Motherland" are equally effective slogans to inspire the morale of the front and the rear.</p>
<p>The Soviet people believe that Stalin is the motherland, the defender and savior of the motherland, which has laid a solid foundation for his personal status. In short, Stalin is a loyal successor to Lenin's policies, a faithful implementer of Bolshevik policies, and also a genius politician and strategist. Because Stalin is a communist and the Soviet Union is a socialist country, his position is unshakable. The so-called dictator Stalin is also a pillar of the communist regime. Therefore, we must understand that the Stalin regime means the communist regime.</p>
<p>Therefore, to talk about the movements of the Stalin regime, we must observe the activities of the Communist Party. The following attempts to examine how the Communist Party has been active in the two years since the start of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Full-Scale Activities of the Communist Party</p>
<p>Since its founding, the Soviet Union has organized all institutions based on the principle of "nation first," and the people have engaged in labor under the same principle. This situation has not changed in any way since the start of the German-Soviet war. The principle of "nation first" remains the foundation for the war against Germany, but the so-called "nation" has become the "motherland."</p>
<p>Before the war, the Communist Party was the central hub of the state. This relationship has not changed at all since the start of the German-Soviet war. The Communist Party continues to promote the war against Germany in the front and the rear, and the policies of the Communist Party determine the policies of the government. Moreover, there have been no changes in the members of the Central Executive Committee of the Party, so the Communist Party continues to adopt unchanged policies.</p>
<p>Stalin stipulated that the activities of the Party organs after the start of the war should be directed in two ways: first, to expand peaceful construction and organize a strong rear; and second, to carry out offensive and defensive battles by the Soviet Army. The Communist Party has been fully active on the two fronts stipulated by Stalin, becoming a driving force for increasing military production and increasing agricultural production in the rear, and playing a huge role in improving the Soviet Army's combat effectiveness, boosting morale, and enforcing military discipline on the front lines.</p>
<p>According to the Red Star newspaper: "War is a school for party members, a testing ground." The Soviet Union has enhanced the political consciousness of party members through the war, taught non-party members through the war, and strengthened the Communist Party. This is what Stalin called the elevation of political consciousness, which is immediately reflected in the war resistance, and the increase in war resistance also leads to the elevation of political consciousness, with each interacting with the other.</p>
<p>In his May 1st Labor Day proclamation this year, Stalin pointed out the importance of popularizing the sense of war, and that to popularize the sense of war, it is necessary to first elevate the people's political consciousness, that is, the sense of war resistance, and devote all efforts to political propaganda.</p>
<p>As a result, the number of party members is bound to increase greatly, but this is hampered by the complicated procedures for joining the party, so Soviet newspapers have called for simplifying the procedures for joining the party. Especially on the front lines, the procedures for joining the party have a significant impact because of the daily battles.</p>
<p>As a result, the procedures for joining the party have been greatly relaxed, and the number of party members in the army has increased sharply. At the same time, with the easing of the procedures for joining the party, it is expected that the quality of party members will decline and other malpractices will occur. The Communist Party is taking various appropriate measures to prevent the above-mentioned malpractices.</p>
<p>Also, the main area of activity for the Communist Party in the rear is to improve labor productivity, strengthen labor discipline, increase production, and cultivate the spirit of selflessness among workers and farmers. For example, a local party organ is responsible for increasing agricultural production. During the harvest season, it sends many party member pioneers to various places to guide farmers, lead by example, and serve as models for farmers. This kind of political education of labor has the same great effect as the political education through combat on the front lines. According to the Pravda newspaper, when the Caucasus republics were under the threat of the German army last year, Stalin sent Beria to organize the defense of the Caucasus. It is said that Beria combined the defense forces of the Georgian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian republics, and organized a solid defense force in the rear. This kind of example is not just Beria. For example, Zhdanov on the Leningrad front, Voroshilov on the southern front, Zhgadzhin on the northwestern front, and Mekhlis on the Volkhov front, etc., cannot be enumerated one by one.</p>
<p>Political Propaganda Further Strengthened</p>
<p>Soviet political propaganda cannot be separated from the Party and examined independently, especially during wartime. It used to be said: "Party organs must know that political propaganda is as necessary to the people as air," or "Political propaganda is to party members what blood transfusions are." Since the start of the German-Soviet war, the need for political propaganda has been particularly keenly felt, so the number of propagandists and agitators has greatly increased.</p>
<p>What has become a prominent issue is that since the start of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has devoted all its efforts to elevating the people's patriotism, putting forward the term "Motherland" that was not often used before, adding the name "Great Patriotic War" to the war against Germany, further stimulating the worship of heroes in the front and rear, and deepening the impression that the people have abandoned communist propaganda. However, the Soviet Union will never abandon communist propaganda, but will strengthen it even more.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union followed the example of Napoleon's invasion of Moscow and stipulated that the "Defense of the Motherland" should be the purpose of this war. This clearly hints at Stalin's clever intentions. Apart from his own country, he said that the war aims of other countries stemmed from imperialist intentions. On this point, Soviet propaganda remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Especially regarding the war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States, they were defined as imperialist wars before the start of the German-Soviet war. Since the start of the war, because of the relationship with the Soviet Union, they have been called wars for democracy and wars for freedom, showing a flattering attitude. But this is undoubtedly based on extreme realism. After the end of the First Five-Year Plan, when the crisis of the Second World War became increasingly mature due to the encirclement policy of various countries against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union used to stir up the patriotic feelings of the people. Of course, in the event of a crusade against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union believes that patriotism is indeed the most important factor in strengthening the war resistance of the Soviet people.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the start of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has of course also been engaged in stirring up the people's patriotism, propagating the preservation of the tradition of Russia, which has never been bullied by foreign enemies. In the eyes of the Soviet authorities, that is just a policy necessary for carrying out the war. In short, the motherland is none other than the socialist motherland.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union is now allied with the United Kingdom and the United States. In order to fight against Germany, it has to use the strength of the United Kingdom and the United States, so it calls the United Kingdom and the United States defenders of democracy and friends of freedom. But because of the demands of the unpredictable world war situation, once there is a dispute with the United Kingdom and the United States, the "defenders of democracy and friends of freedom" will immediately become "imperialists."</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union is only engaged in trying to strengthen the war resistance of the Soviet Union through communist propaganda, and this point has not changed in any way. As mentioned above, the Soviet Union's strengthening of political propaganda is not a departure from reality, and its activities are not in abstract terms, but through activities on the actual battlefield and on the war wounds. Moreover, in the Soviet Union, the weapon of political propaganda is communist propaganda, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>All in all, the elevation of patriotism and hatred of the enemy in the front and rear can be expected through communist propaganda, which is a unique method of the Soviet Union, and the slogan "Everything for the war" is also realized in this form.

<h3>Countermeasures to Prevent Illegal Price Increases and Black Market Trading</h3>
<p>— Chen Naichao</p>
<p>Methods of suppressing prices, countermeasures to eliminate speculation and hoarding, etc.—this type of writing has been common in newspapers and magazines, but most of them are extremely general and broad methods. This article is limited to illegal price increases and black market trading by shops and manufacturers. Because all price increases are affected by the black market trading of shops, and they use various cunning tricks to escape the authorities' net. As far as the author's limited knowledge goes, the following suggestions are offered:</p>
<p>The previous price limits of the Shanghai Municipal Council could only be implemented in larger companies and shops. As for small shops, they often overcharge people who "don't understand the market," or they just say "out of stock." They have no invoices and no proof, so even if the authorities know it, they have no way to catch them "red-handed." Even larger shops often do not sell goods with price limits at the retail level because they have invoices, but wholesale them to small shops at black market prices. In this way, the price limits become ineffective. Another point is that the price limits are often used as a basis by a group of unscrupulous merchants. "The Municipal Council's price limit is already this much." The black market price is of course one or two times higher. At the same time, the Municipal Council's price limits are constantly increasing, so the black market price of goods is also constantly rising. If you want to limit prices, you must stipulate fair and realistic prices. Once stipulated, you cannot increase them at will, and you would rather sell out. If it is found that the price limit has been exceeded, the strictest punishment must be imposed, and the matter cannot be settled by asking for a substitute. According to a friend from Japan, Japanese department stores cannot raise prices even if they sell out.</p>
<p>Many factories have now been handed over to our country. In the future, the products will be divided into several grades, A, B, C, and D, based on their materials, and the prices will be fixed. It is not allowed to manufacture a variety of products, so as to implement a unified wartime production system, and investigation will also be more convenient.</p>
<p>In addition to unifying factory manufacturing, the name, number, price, and sample of each product must also be submitted to the authorities for record-keeping. At the same time, each time a new item is produced, it must also be registered and approved by the authorities before it can be sold on the market. This way, the authorities will have a basis and samples, and the investigation will be much simpler. It is not allowed to sell anything that has not been registered and approved. For example, last year, there was a type of grape wine that sold for more than thirty yuan at the time. Later, it was replaced with another brand and cost sixty yuan, and now it has been replaced with another brand and sells for more than one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the date of manufacture must be marked on the products of the factory. If there is trademark paper, it should be written on it. If it is a woven product, the date of manufacture should be clearly marked on the edge. If it is a hardware product, the date of manufacture should be stamped on the body or bottom. Once the price is fixed in this way, the products of this period will never be allowed to rise by even a penny. In this way, hoarders will not be able to move.</p>
<p>All retail stores must issue invoices to buyers. The invoice must clearly state the name of the goods, the item number, the name of the factory, and the price. If one item is missing, it will not work. If there is no invoice or vague terms, it is an example of punishment. Stores often write vaguely on the invoices when selling goods that exceed the price limit. For example, "one foot of cloth, one foot of silk," or "A tea, B tea" and other secret codes. This kind of trick often deceives everyone.</p>
<p>Rationed goods such as cigarettes and matches are often taken by the rationed retailers for more than 70% of the profit and sold on the black market. Only a small amount is sold at the door, about 30%. If you say he doesn't sell it, he actually has it to sell. If you say he sells it, he only sells a little bit. In this way, it is extremely difficult for the authorities to investigate. Preventing this kind of method is extremely difficult. If you issue invoices, cigarettes are so small and the price is so expensive that you can't even earn the price of the paper. The only way is to prohibit transportation at all times (free transportation of beer, which the patrolmen do not deal with, leads to the convenience of black market trading, so the black market is extremely popular). After daily sales, officials from the bureau are sent to check the inventory.</p>
<p>All inventories, whether in shops, private individuals, factories, etc., should be registered in detail. The authorities should issue a registration certificate, stating the owner's name, the name of the goods, the quantity, and the location. The sale or transfer of the goods must also be registered with the authorities and the price must be stated. This is also a way to prevent the black market. This method has already been implemented, but it is not thorough. It only covers some goods, food, and controlled products. The number of hoarded goods in private residences and retail stores is indeed quite large. If you want to eliminate hoarding, no matter what kind of goods, no matter how much the quantity, you must register in detail and implement it thoroughly.</p>
<p>There is a group of speculative merchants who open so-called firms, companies, western medicine stores, etc., which specialize in speculating on the black market or buying and selling black market goods for others. The authorities must register this type of shop and conduct an investigation to determine whether its business is legitimate, otherwise it will be ordered to close down in order to reduce the nests of the black market.</p>
<p>In wartime, the supply of materials cannot meet the demand, which is a certain truth. Therefore, a group of unscrupulous merchants take advantage of this opportunity to monopolize prices, causing them to rise endlessly, which affects the lives of the people on a small scale, and the future of the nation and the country on a large scale. Now that the concessions have been taken over, proceeding is relatively direct, and eliminating speculation, hoarding, and the black market is an urgent task today. They are like parasites in the human body in the country and society. We must prescribe the right medicine and give injections to eliminate them.</p>

<h3>Privately Contracted Hospitals – Benefiting Impoverished and Sick Teachers – This Newspaper Distributes Subsidies to Express Gratitude</h3>
<p>Since the Water Conservancy Bureau began handling medical subsidies for primary school teachers, a large number of people have applied to the Bureau for free treatment, especially those who are both pregnant and suffering from lung disease. They have been introduced to the following hospitals for examination, and these hospitals, in the spirit of serving the people, have cooperated with the Bureau. The teachers who were introduced to the hospitals for treatment have been given careful treatment and have recovered. In particular, they have been given preferential treatment in terms of medical expenses and hospitalization. The Bureau deeply admires their spirit of service and sacrifice. Because medical expenses are very high, the Bureau has specially subsidized these hospitals. Although it is only a drop in the bucket, it is only to show the gratitude of the colleagues of this newspaper.</p>
<p>The amounts are as follows: Yuzhu Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Chinese Health Association, 1,000 yuan; Yongjun Eye Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Hongren Hospital, 10,000 yuan; Foguang Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Chinese Dental Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Cash subsidies to five teachers suffering from lung disease, 1,000 yuan; Xi's Hospital, 10,000 yuan; Tongren Hospital, 5,000 yuan; Pingmin Infant Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Anti-Tuberculosis Association, 1,000 yuan. The Bureau originally subsidized Nanyang Hospital with 3,000 yuan, but President Xian repeatedly declined, saying that the hospital would give preferential treatment to primary school teachers suffering from illness in the spirit of service, so it was unwilling to accept the Bureau's donation. This is specially noted to praise his benevolence.</p>
<h3>A Self-Abusing Youth</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>Although the heavy rain has stopped, the sky is white and foggy, and there is still a hint of rain. At this time, the air is very dull. I stepped onto the sun deck to relieve my boredom. This is a common thing: because below the sun deck is a vast mountain, on windy and sunny days, many people roam in it like a flower garden, and I can see pairs of people leaning on each other or holding hands, as well as all kinds of people and square tombstones. But what I saw today was something that made me very sad, and it can also be said to be a painful thing in society.</p>
<p>A young man of about twenty years old, wearing a raincoat, hid on one side of the dense woods, furtively looking out. When he saw that no one was near, he began to engage in his suicidal behavior – self-pleasuring – unaware that I was watching him. The wind blew the leaves, making a rustling sound. He may have been fumbling for several minutes, and then straightened his clothes and left. The sky gradually turned dark, and a hazy drizzle fell. His figure also disappeared from my sight.</p>
<p>Even if it is a young man, he is consuming his energy, and is also subjected to the impact of wind and rain, so how can he not be sick. No wonder in recent years, there have been an unusual number of young people suffering from tuberculosis. Naturally, it is because the body is weak and easily susceptible to germs. Young people are the foundation of the country and the backbone of society. If the foundations are dilapidated, what hope is there for the future? I am truly saddened by it. Shanghai is indeed an evil city; the easy availability of pornographic books and the enticements of the surrounding area, and the extravagant customs often tempt young people with weak wills, who cannot resist external enticements, and become addicted to various bad habits, to the point of destruction. This is a truly painful thing!</p>
<p>I hope that parents can thoroughly explain the advantages and disadvantages of this to their beloved sons, so that they know that such behavior is equivalent to suicide, leading to destruction. I also hope that the authorities can confiscate all pornographic books, improve urban customs, and ban bad enticements. This will truly benefit the country and society.</p>
<h3>Lianyi Charity School – Hosting a Tea Party for All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>The Lianyi Primary School on Meizhou Road was founded by Ms. Gao Daying. It currently has six classes of primary school students, totaling 300 people. In order to help out-of-school children, it has set up many free places and provides books. It now plans to add a branch school on the western section of Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday, Lan Shishi, the former school director, Fan Huichun, the finance director, Cheng Zhiliang, and Huang Jingwan, the headmaster, hosted a tea party for all walks of life at the Huamei, with more than 40 people in attendance. They specially invited Sun Xiangzhong, the headmaster of the Patriotic Girls' School, to speak about the essentials of virtue and Confucius' teaching without discrimination, as a pioneer in eliminating the class system in education. They also hoped that all districts would set up more public charity schools to eradicate illiteracy. The district chiefs all expressed their willingness to promote ethical slogans, such as loyalty and forbearance.</p>
<h3>Eighth District Public School</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Party Department of this city is holding public schools. The Luxiawan No. 16 Guanghan Elementary School and the First School and the Tini Kak Road Min Village Peipei School as the Second School still have vacancies. Register as soon as possible.</p>
