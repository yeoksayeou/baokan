<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐亞戰局的展望</h3>
<p>一九四三年，將是這次世界大戰決戰的一年，也將是決定未來世界形勢的一年，這種論調，一時固難加以肯定，然而，綜合新春以來交戰雙方的一切動態來看，其準備之周詳，動員之澈底，以及各方面對於未來戰局之重視，我們可以斷定，即將展開的夏季戰爭，其規模之寵大與意義之重要，一定是空前未有的。</p>
<p>首先，從北非戰局說，由於軸心軍從突尼斯比塞大之撤退，已開始了劃時期的轉變，就是北非戰局已不再是世界戰爭的重心之一，這個重心已經轉移到地中海了。從今春以來，由於反軸心軍絕對優勢的兵力的壓迫，北非的軸心軍，在羅美爾與阿爾寗將軍的指揮之下，進行了最艱苦的奮鬥，爭取了幾個月的時間，使「歐洲大陸要塞化」的工作能夠從容完成。除了這一主要任務之外，軸心軍還有兩大决要任務，就是（一）儘一切可能，給予反軸心軍以更多的打擊與消耗，預先削弱英美軍侵犯歐陸的戰鬥意志和戰鬥力量；（二）儘一切可能，保全北非軸心軍優秀的戰鬬力，使在最危急的局面之下，可以轉移到地中海其他戰略要點或歐洲陣地。至目前爲止，反軸心的宣傳機關，也沒有能力可以指出北非軸心軍未曾完成上述任務的事實。其次，退出突尼斯與比塞大之後，有如義大利新聞報主筆蓋達所指出的：「英美帝國主義者之戰爭，已漸由非洲大陸轉向歐洲大陸」（十一日中央社羅馬電）。然而，在這裏我們不能忽視下列三件事實：（一）縱使是英美的宣傳電訉，也不能不承認目前軸心軍在突尼斯東南山中及崩角半島等地，尙有大的十萬以上的兵力，保持其强大的戰鬬力。這是英美侵攻歐陸的有力的覊絆。（二）如上文所引蓋達所指出的：一軸心軍現已完成其歐洲之防衛計劃。此可待諸今後的事實證明」。以乘隙取巧爲一貫戰略的英美軍，加以彼此間迄未完成最密切無間的戰略及指揮上的統一，是否會昧然輕進，當然是一大疑問。（三）西班牙法朗哥將軍之和平呼籲（十日中央社里斯本電），土耳其薩拉卓格魯總理關於對英國由絕對中立進而恢復非交戰國的聲明（十一日東京每日新聞夕刋所載），這種政治或外交上的微妙的發展，對於緩和戰機上的作用是不容輕忽的。因此，我們雖然應該指出歐洲戰事的可能性，及其必然要展開的前途，但同時要指出，最近的戰局重心，仍在地中海海空戰和大西洋海上的潛艇戰。</p>
<p>再就德蘇戰塲來看，從三月下旬以來，幾乎沉寂了快兩個月了。在這期間，雙方關於未來大規模作戰的準備，單憑常識也可以斷定的。軸心軍方面的準備，在時間方面，似乎較蘇聯爲久。從一九四二年冬季開始已經停止攻勢，進行第二次大攻勢的準備工作，而紅軍方面直到今年三月中旬還在緊張的作戰中，這樣，在雙方的戰略準備工作的成效上，自然不會相等。在空間方面，德國全體總動員的範圍之廣大，和蘇聯之限於烏拉爾以東向來貧弱的地區，只要展開世界地圖來對比一下，便可以瞭然的。至於素質方面，包括精神情緒與物質裝備兩者，自然不容易輕加論斷，但據德軍專門家所說：「蘇聯徹底動員男子，積極擴充軍需工業，以塡補冬季戰所受人物損失一事，大體已獲成功，惟此係量的方面，兵士之質的方面，則較開始冬季反攻之時遠爲低劣；蘇軍於兵器整備方面，似已恢復前此之强力，其重兵器大見增强。」（十一日中央社柏林電）從以上時間，空間與素質方面來看，可以見到蘇聯要與英美呼應而在夏季採取攻勢，似乎是不可能的。相反的。軸心軍雖然增加了關於地中海和歐陸方面防禦的注意，但一般的說，其戰略目標，始終未從東線他移。因此，決定性的戰爭，仍將在東綫演出，而且日子的到來會更快些。</p>
<p>最後，我們一向重視東亞戰局對於世界戰爭的決定的影響。英美在其侵犯歐陸的戰略計劃中，最大的憂慮，就是日本軍隊和政治的勢力，在太平洋上飛躍的擴展。反軸心軍首腦部最近所顧慮的，主要的就在一日本明日向何處進攻。」他們的估計大致不出以下三點：（一）北進路綫之開闢，這是英美正在宣傳中，而包含着挑撥日蘇關係的惡意的。（二）南進路綫，進軍澳洲，近來不僅澳洲當局惶恐萬狀，而且英美太平洋方面作戰當局也不斷的哀鳴求援。（三）西進路綫，最近對緬印邊境作戰的勝利，更增加了英美所感受的威脅。綜合來看，反軸心軍方面這種草木皆兵的情緒，深深地刻劃出他們對太平洋方面戰意的消失與處境的困厄。而事實上，日軍也確已保持着絕對的主動，保持着可以對任何方面進行攻勢的優越地位。當世界戰局開始新的轉變之際，他更不會疏忽爭取更大勝利的機會的。至於最近政治上總力戰體制的刷新與强化。在外交上東條首相之蒞臨中。滿。菲島和靑木大臣之歷訪南洋各地，以及內外經濟上的新措施等，都已表現出對於不久將來的決戰準備之周到與完善，與本十及東亞一切國力之更充分的緊張。我們論述至此，所負疚與不安的，是我們中國在這嚴重的大局之前，所盡的力量實在太有限了，特別是渝共政權，繼續負嵎頑抗，從本國說已極不幸，從中國對世界的責任說，更應引起自責的心情。近來日本中國派遣軍對晋豫邊區，晋察冀邊區及洞庭湖西南岸的二期進攻，正說明了中國有進一步振作他自已的力量以協助日本推進未來戰略的必要。在這裏，我們不僅希望和平區的同胞的覺悟與努力，更期望渝共挾持下的同胞認淸現實，擺脫極梏，共同犧牲奮鬬，走上光明大道，在世界戰局激劇轉變中，共求束亞民族的眞正的解放。</p>

<p>南京十三日中央社電　第十四次最高國防會議通過，組織物資調查委員會，關於物資調查與取締囤積，固有莫大裨益云，其於安定民生上亦大有連繋，茲既經最高國防會議通過本案，則物資調查當必有更具體之進展。查此次中日雙方委員，均係官方權威，而物資最集中之地，莫如上海，以上海特別市長陳公博爲此物資調查組織之委員會委員長，自屬適當，此外中國方面委員，有實業財政袁陳兩次長，全國商業統制總會陳監理官，上海市政府秘書長及警察經濟兩局長亦均受兼委員新命，更佐以經濟顧問岡田大佐，陣容可謂整備。日本方面以田尻駐上海公使爲首腦，及大使館總軍部海軍方面各適當人士，復佐以工部局警察副總監經濟部長等，實爲一有力之調查機構，各人對此實以極大期待。</p>

<h3>國府軍事視察團　葉蓬一行由日抵滬</h3>
<p>國民政府特派赴日軍事視察團陸軍上將枼蓬。孫良誠。胡毓坤，及陸軍中將項致莊。楊仲華。一行，自東渡出國以來，對友邦各項軍事上之設備，考察綦詳，用資借鏡，以增强參戰後之吾國軍力量，茲悉葉將軍等在日任務已畢，特於日前（十二）午後六時，乘機安然返國，市警察總局局長兼保安副司令盧英等均到機塲迎迓，分致寒暄後，即導入官邸休息，昨晚盧氏復在其私邸設筵歡宴，賓主備極歡洽，聞葉氏等在滬稍事逗留，即行入京，晋謁在委員長報吿此次赴日考察經過。</p>
<p>各團員談赴日觀感</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　中國國民政府派遣來日之軍事觀察團，對戰都東京及附近各地均有詳盡考察，所得印象，至爲良好，十二日已離此啟程返國，以下是該團團長葉蓬上將等臨行所談觀感大意，茲誌如次：</p>
<p>葉蓬上將（國府陸軍部長）談：此次來友邦考察所感實多，概括言之，決戰期下之日本，已經成爲一座大兵營，這個大兵營中，任何人，任何事，都在緊張中活動着，加以資源豊富，生產增强，所以沒有物質不足的現象，確能進行長期戰爭。這個大兵營的鬥士，更都有「一生懸命」的精神與「大東亞戰爭必勝」的信念，凡此種種都只有使我感佩。其中値得一說的就是我們參綱某日本國民學校的時候，該校校長親任引導，當我等行至某牆時正有一自來水管並未關閉，流水汨汨，該校長見後即上前將其關閉，此事雖小，惟所感實深，蓋於此足以表示日本國民節的之精神，與處事之認眞負責，此實堪爲我等所效法者。孫良誠上將（國府第二方面軍總司令）談：未來日本以前，在余之想像中已有一個很好的印象，到了日本後，經過詳盡考察，更得到淸晰深刻之認識，尤其是在此決戰期下之日本國民精神，更値得吾人讚佩。中國過去着重精神，歐美提倡物質，因爲都是偏於一端，所以也都發生種種弊害。但是日本恰能把精神與物質融爲一體，表裏相用，因乃有今日之强盛，有今日之結果，這是任何國家所不能相比的。余此次來日所見甚多，予余感覺最深者即爲統制政策之賢明完善，蓋此並非爲物資小足之表現，實爲戰時下必須之對策，由於統制方法之合理，故日本國民無論上下貧富均能有平均享受確保生活之安定。，中國古諺有云，「不患寡而患不均」，日本恰能作到此「均」宇，所謂囤積居奇，圖利肥己之事，此在日本絕無所聞，實足以反映戰時下日本經濟民生之安定。</p>
<h3>洞庭湖展開攻勢後　日軍獲偉大戰果</h3>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電　日軍此次於洞庭湖地區展開攻勢後，已予渝第六戰區中樞部以極大打擊，按洞庭湖地區與四川省同爲渝方之（穀倉地帶），今經此打擊，渝方之焦燥不安小難想像。頃據渝電，渝掃蕩報十三亦曾謂此次日軍於洞庭湖地區之作戰，已使湖南戰區僅存之穀倉遭受深刻之打擊與損失，此於經濟上貫爲巨大創傷云云，故渝方之狼狽情况亦於此可見。</p>
<p>湖南前綫十三日中央社電　渝第二十九集團軍此次在洞庭湖畔被日軍痛剿，似已潰不成軍，僅有上級幹部將校遁走。據最近湖南前綫所接消息，渝卞因第二十九集團軍喪師失地頗感焦燥，故最近已命令第六戰區代理司令孫連仲迅速挽救頹勢。又渝第十集團軍因懼日軍閃電作戰，刻正傾全力於防衛湘省西北部之澧縣津市兩要衝，積極構築陣地。</p>
<p>湘省南縣十三日中央社電南縣巳於八日爲日軍佔領，因渝軍曾實行焦土戰術，致全城盡成廢墟，居民無家可歸，嗷嗷待哺，厥狀殊慘，日軍淮城後，當即加以救濟，一般居民對此深表感謝，決從焦土之灰燼中，着手建設工作，以謀中國之復興。又渝軍於退出南縣之際，因過於狼狽，故遺留大批建築兵營及倉庫用之木材，刻日軍擬將其一部發給居民，以作修築房屋，其他則全部用作建設湘南之用，現日軍已得居民協助，在九都右岸編成木筏部隊，向某地溯航中。</p>
<h3>畑總司令蒞通　視察蘇北清鄉地區</h3>
<p>南通十三日中央社電　日駐華派遺軍總司令畑俊六大將，爲訪問蘇北淸鄕地區，特於十三日偕隨員由京啓程，於上午十一時抵通，前往歡迎者有淸委會秘書長李士羣，蘇北淸鄕主任張北生，黨辦處孫書記長等，以及各機關代表各校學生有千餘人，沿途軍警密佈戒備森嚴，加總司令與歡迎人員握手爲禮，旋於樂聲　揚中，乘車赴行轅休息。</p>
<h3>中共黨員三千人　宣言脫離共黨</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電</p>
<p>據南京大陸新報所得情報，在江西省發行之重慶系機關報（捷報）所載，有加入中共之三千黨員，感於中共抗戰理論之矛盾，發表脫離中共共同宣言，於中共本營江西發生上述情事，　見我和運理論之正確。聞其脫離宣言內容如下，抗戰以來，中共之罪惡，人所共知，中共抗戰之目的，純爲彼等私慾計算，我人民徒供其犧牲，尤其中共之陰謀，最近愈見暴露，竟企圖消滅國民黨，復要求取消政府之一切正當行政組織，幾欲起而代現有政治統制勢力。茲爲與中共鬥爭，特宣言脫離關係，上述脫離幹部計有（一）前中共江西省贛西南特委會書記黃路平，（二）贛西北特委會書記張籙，（三）北特委員會書記徐良善，（四）越邊靑年部主任失萍，（五）贛東特委會書記楊複生，（六）閩北特委會委員邱美峯等，總數近三千人。當茲我國府規復江西省治，政治力擴張一之際，殊値注目。</p>
<h3>財部限制　新設金融機</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電</p>
<p>關於上海地區限制新設金融機關一事，早經財政部於上年十二月十八日發表談話，截止註册，迄逾數月，而滬市區埠以內，尙有少數新設金融機關陸續開業情事，外界不明眞相，或因此發生疑慮，記者特因此事往訪財政部負責人員，承以經辦實情見吿，略謂，本部自上年十二月十八日發表談話，截止註冊後，所有對於上海地區新設金融機關，在上年十二月十八日以後呈請到部者，一概予以批駁，期達政府統制金融之政策。至截止註册以後，上海區內雖尙有少數金融機關陸續門業，然均係在上年十二月十八日以前呈請到部業經先後批准辦理，此外尙有遵照本部核准展限改爲股份公司之合夥組織各錢莊，均因籌備事改組未竣，以致遲遲開業，並非截止以後經部核准新設等語，用特發表以明眞相。</p>
<h3>華中鐵道計劃　開掘長江隧道</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電華中鐵道公司頃計劃於長江江底開掘隧道，以聯絡京滬津浦兩鐵道，刻正調查中。蓋下關浦口間相隔一長江，旅客往返極感不便，茲爲打開此運輸上之困難，計劃於和平門站附近掘人地層再潛越長江，於北岸浦口站北方掘出，其全部工事的需五年，工程費需七千萬日金，此計劃完成後，南京津浦北京新京京城等地均直接運輸</p>

<h3>土耳其議員重申　保持中立決心　全國壯丁不得逃避兵役　若干政府機關遷離土京</h3>
<p>斯丹埠十三日中央社電</p>
<p>土耳其著名議員阿克興報總編輯薩達克頃著社論云：土耳其毫無領土野心與要求，此項宗旨至今未變，蓋其對於自己之命運已甚滿意，並無改變立塲之意向。土耳其之武裝中立政策，殊屬聰明之舉，今仍將繼續之。世界各國應明瞭土耳其之立塲，最近國內外人士似有引起疑慮者殊爲遺憾。此項人士咸信第二戰綫一旦在地中海區或巴爾幹成立，雙方交戰國最近似之攻守路綫，將爲假道土耳其，故認爲土國將欲被迫放棄其目前之政策。實則德國在集中其所有武力於東綫之際，將不致改變其對土關係，回憶德軍在巴爾幹戰役中，軍隊進至土邊即行停止，旋即與土耳其締結友誼之條約，今日土耳其已獲得世界及德國之完全信託云。</p>

<h3>羅邱賡續會談　檢討今後戰略</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十三日中央</p>
<p>社電　據華盛頓來電：英首相邱吉爾十一日下午抵華盛頓後，當晚即赴白宮與羅斯福單獨開始會談，十二日繼續舉行，向時與邱吉爾同行之英軍司令亦與美參謀總長馬歇爾大將。聯合艦隊司令楊格提發等會談。據美總統秘書聲稱，後者會談之方式，與「加港會談」時同，預定與兩首腦會談併行，由兩國軍事代表舉行會議，答覆兩首腦之質問提出報吿及建議案等。會談置重阻止反軸心軍之作戰計劃及「政治戰略」，並不涉及經濟問題。華府政界觀測此次會談要點如下：（一）「戰略及補給問題」（一）歐洲戰綫及歐陸登陸作戰，（一）補給問題之再檢討及潛艇戰對策；（二）「政治及外交問題」（一）解決蘇波問題，（一）促成特戈爾與季勞之團結。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電</p>
<p>據華盛頓消息：羅邱會議昨已於白官啓幕，兩人已作一度非正式談話，參加人數亦日有增加，如加首相金已在下院宣佈，定下週啟程赴華府參加會議，澳外相伊伐特曁渝外長宋子文雖無參加之確息，而均留華府並未他去。捷克總統貝奈斯昨亦蒞臨白宮，傳將與羅總統及赫爾商討中東歐各國間之將來關係。華府有資格方面指稱，會議主要議程爲重溫進攻歐陸之舊夢，與運輸之必要準備，以及配發戰時物料與各戰備。</p>
<p>英美軍政人員出席會議名單　里斯本十二日中央社電　據本日華盛頓消息，白宮秘書歐萊本日發表反軸心軍事領袖之參加華盛頓羅邱會議者之名單：計英國方面有英帝國總參謀長勃魯克爵士，空軍參謀長波托爾元帥。駐印英軍總司令華維爾元帥。英國遠東艦隊總司令蘇瑪維爾中將。空軍司令貝爾斯元帥。英運輸大臣萊特斯勳爵。海軍大臣龐特爵士：美國方面有陸軍參謀長馬歇爾將軍。美海軍總司令金上將，駐印度美軍總司令史蒂維雨，美國駐渝空軍司令程諾德少將。歐萊透露羅邱二人將與其他領袖隔別另行會談，並將偶或參加其他領袖間之討論。據路透社倫敦消息，華維爾在伴同邱吉爾來美之前，曾在英國有相當時期之逗留。同時白宮方面本日又透露，戰後問題亦爲會議題材之一。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電</p>
<p>英方人士鄭重聲明謂皮佛勃羅克勳爵雖奧邱吉爾同機來美，但並不在隨員之列，乃係以私人資格遊美。美聯肚紐約來訊云，此次邱吉爾扺美確期及路綫，均未經宜布，唯一報吿即邱氏係乘飛機來美，並挨乘火車至華盛頓云。</p>
<p>亞洲各項問題　亦將提出討論　璐士京城十二日中央社電據美京來電，華盛頓消息靈通方面預料，此次羅斯福與邱吉爾會議之討論主題，將爲如何實現在歐洲大陸開闢第一戰塲之計劃，一如在加薩勃朗加會議中所作成之大綱。華盛頓消息靈通方面並指出，亞洲各問題亦將提出討論，來自東亞之重要人物如澳洲外交大臣伊伐特。渝方外長宋子文。蔣夫人宋美齡。以及目下在華盛頓之羅斯福駐印私人代表斐利浦等，均有參加會議之可能。</p>
<p>盤谷十二日中央社電</p>
<p>德國新聞社訊：關於邱吉爾訪羅斯福事，頃攎印廣播評論家宜稱，該二氏此次之會晤，或將對印度問題試獲一解決辦法。羅斯福駐印代表斐利浦刻正在美報吿其親察經過，羅氏將直接聽取渠之報吿。</p>
<p>柏林方面推測　政治重於軍事</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德外交部發言人本日宣稱，斯達林之未出席於華盛頓所舉行之英美會議，即表明反軸心國間之齟齬依然存在。發言人評論稱，此次羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相會談之特點，爲蘇聯領袖之缺席，在過去數星期中，英美之報紙曾鼓吹羅斯福邱吉爾與期達林之間有舉行會商之必要，但莫斯科方面並無反嚮。此項事實表明與邱吉爾偕行之軍事人員不過係代表牲質，而自加薩勃朗加會議後所發生之政治問題，無疑的將在談判中佔顯著地位，因此斯經林之不出席華盛頓會議，乃極爲自然之事，此亦足證明聯合國所描述之反軸心國家實係錯誤，英美在加薩勃朗加會議之後，曾向世界保證，謂已決定未來九個月反軸心之軍事計劃現時僅及四月，故可推定此次會議政治重於軍事（三）廢棄田地，背</p>
<h3>世界史上的一大悲劇（三）</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>（三）廢宗敎</p>
<p>離宗敎</p>
<p>英國是由澈底的個人至上主義而成立的國家。這在國家太平無事的時候，在國務的運用上，雖然不發生怎樣的障碍；可是國家一有變故，就要忽地成爲一個致命的癥結。這是因爲個人爲國家而存在，故不得不轉而向着個人要求其成爲爲國家而存在的個人，在英國，一旦有緩急臨頭，如那義勇奉公的事情，雖然並非全然沒有，却也不過是例外而已。</p>
<p>在這樣的情形之下，國家雖然是爲着個人而存在的，可是維持這個國家，實即所以擁護其個人的利益，故個人爲國家而犧牲，歸根結底，也無非是個人爲個人而犧牲。依着遠打灣轉論理的轉變，個人也應該被要求爲國家而犧牲。</p>
<p>爲了這個緣故，所以英國雖在生死存亡的十字街頭，還是不能够實行徵兵令。就是能够實行，也總是在戰事旣酣之後；並且就是在後來，也總不能爲充分有效的施行。甚至在這樣的時候，那班從事製造軍需品的勞工，爲了工資問題，對政府還要提出不當或過當的要求；如果不答應他們，竟然不惜出於同盟罷工的一途。在日本，則這種行動，簡直要被視爲對於國家的謀反；然而在英國，却無論何人，對於這種現象，恬然不以爲怪。</p>
<p>拿破侖稱英國人爲「穿着圍裙的國民」，是一點不錯的。英國人並不是生龍活虎似的敏捷的國民，縱然有着很大的成就，但其根性，無論如何，總是脫不了利益上的計算—總是脫不了穿着圍裙的店倌兒的根性，這個店倌兒的根性和海盜根性，迭相爲用，就是英國的所以成爲世界的大帝國的因素。</p>
<p>但是，也就爲了那個緣故，使英國忘記了泥拔頭，忽略了農業，顧不到一旦海運業停頓就要陷於餓死的危險。在上决世界大戰時，德國潛艇逞其猛威，若是再維持當時的現狀二星期，便會使倫敦的八百萬市民，一律活活地餓死。</p>
<p>懲前毖後，現在雖然對於糧食之類有着相當的囤貯，可是那也並非沒有限量的。前回在公園裏栽種馬鈴薯，在高爾夫球塲裏栽種小麥之類等，雖着實地做盡了種種應急的辦法，可是總不過爲一時的苟延殘喘之計，沒有根本可以彌補過去的辦法。</p>
<p>英國人本來並不是不知道耕種的國民，畜牧是英國人展所優爲的業務，其所產羊毛的精良，爲歐洲第一，弗朗達（Fladders）方面的毛織業者，完全是以英國爲原料的，然而這素以出產精良的羊毛著稱的英國，到現在不是非但沒有輸出，並且連本國應用的，還是要仰給歐洲和紐西蘭的輸入嗎？在維多利亞女皇的中期，穀物法令的廢止，曾引起非常爭執的問題；幸而廢止之後，並沒有如同反對者所憂慮那麽多的影響。這是什麽緣故呢？因爲當時從外國輸入的穀物，並沒有超過本國生產的二成以上。</p>
<p>然而從那時起，經過了五十年的現在，英國早已除了依存於加拿大之外，沒有別的辦法。如果反觀一切文化的進程，無不是第一次是狩獵的，第二次是畜牧的，第三次是耕作的；然而英國却全然與此相背而行。從來耕作的田地，盡數把它當做牧塲；成爲畜牧的牧塲，盡數把它當做獵塲。英國的農民離棄了土地而爲流浪的狀態，並非始於最近；像十八世紀末，詩人哥爾德斯密斯（Goldsmith，Oliver）所作的「荒村」詩，巳經在詠着農民漂泊無依的運命了。</p>
<p>那種傾向，隨着時代而爲加速度的進陟。英國的所謂上流社會，不問是爲諾爾曼征服以來的舊貴族，或是由那乘着大資本主義潮流的商工業階級所補充之新貴族，其生活所不可缺的，是賽馬，是打獵，允共是以獵取狐，鹿，兔或鳩雉，山鳥，野鴨爲榮事。因之劃定幾哩或幾十哩的獵區，置獵區人夫，使年年養畜多數的鳥獸，以供打獵期間的娛樂。所以一次獵取鹿幾百頭，雉幾百隻，是決不稀罕的事。</p>
<p>在這樣的狀態之下，他們把土地全然當做獵塲，賽馬塲，或高爾夫球塲，有誰還會油然而生起「陽春敷德澤，萬物生光輝」的感念來呢？</p>
<p>亡英國的，正就是那所以使英國興盛的。英國民輕棄其土地，是使其成爲商工業者而獲得成功，可是使他們連商工業者的地位也不克保持的，也是由於他們輕棄共土地的緣故。</p>
<p>其次爲我們所不容看過的，是宗敎的墮落。對於盎格魯撤克遜獰猛的海盜根性，稍稍寄與道義的氣味和心靈的風格的，是基督敎。在英國的歷史上，愛德華懺悔者（Edward　the　Confesser）是一個怎樣柔弱之王？同時又是一個怎樣篤信之王？其歷史上是遺留着很爲深刻的痕跡的。</p>
<p>所謂淸敎徒革命，在某種意義上，乃是防禦國王或要求政治自由的運動；在經濟上，是土地的分配或收稅多寡的問題；但是其也成爲一個宗敎上的問題，也決不能加以否定。西利說道：</p>
<p>「就是在克倫威瀾的時候，也恰和依利薩伯的時候相同，商業上的感化，喬裝着宗敎上的感化，而伸展其勢力。」</p>
<p>這話當然不錯，宗敎的本身，也把其宗敎的感化，施及於個人或國家，乃是不容蔑視的事。世人把克倫威爾稱之爲偽善者之尤，那是寃枉。克倫威爾一面雖是盎格爾撒克遜人所固有的海盜根性和店倌兒根性的化身；同時却又爲熱心的基督敎徒。在這意味上，他簡直可以說是愛德華懺悔者的後繼者。像他所編成的「鐵騎」，實是號令嚴明，秋毫無犯，他日解散之後，一個也沒有進入浮浪人和野盜之羣，成爲他們之敵的王黨，也曾這樣說。</p>
<p>「他們就是在和平的工作上，也是成功的。不論是麵包師，是石匠，是貨車夫，苟共是從事切實的勞作的，就斷定他是克倫威爾的老兵，大概是不會錯的。」</p>
<p>宗敎在盎格魯撒克遜看來，實是延命的靈藥；自來與時升降，隆汚不同。從十八世紀的中期以迄下期，韋斯雷（Wesley　John）發起宗敎復興運動，自國敎分離而創立美以美敎派。其次在十九世紀中期，牛津大學，以牛曼（Newman　John　Henry)爲主和其他同志，發起敎會復古運動。那運動雖然因着或是轉入羅馬公敎，或是重回英國國敎，沒有舉得充分的效果，却可以算是在宗敎界驚破惰眠的一大警鐘。嗣自以後，便要算到蒲士（Booth　William）的救世軍了。救世軍是從美以美敎派生出來的，這正像美以美敎派是從英國國敎派生出來的一般。可是蒲斯之和未斯雷，在其敎養，趣味，和性格上，適相反對，蒲斯是在熱的，民衆的。</p>
<p>格蘭斯頓也像克倫威爾一樣，被反對黨　稱爲僞善者之允，但他並不是以政治圖私利而濫用强者之權的人，這是任何人所加以認許的。所謂「賊骨頭也有三分理由」，爲海盜國的英國，實際上雖然不會實行，在口頭上却儘管是唱着仁義道德的高調。像格蘭斯頓的政敵索爾斯培利（Salisbury）侯爵，也不惜向着他的靈柩而呈獻其「偉大的基督敎者的經世家」的贊詞。</p>
<p>然而以後的英國却是怎樣呢？英國的政治家有誰足以畀與「基督敎者政治家」的稱號的呢？十九世紀的末期，格闌斯頓逝世以後，政治家的風格每况愈下；縱然是空言無實的基督敎者的風韻，也全然掃地。以至於現在的邱吉爾輩，除了說是傑驚老面皮的海盜的子孫之外，是加不上其他的贊詞的。</p>
<p>到底是英國人遺棄宗敎的呢，還是宗敎遺棄英國人的呢？不管是那樣？英國人總是把不畏神，不敬天，物質萬能主義的海盜根性，盡情無遺蘊地發揮出來。還樣，怎麽不會消耗其國家的元氣而加速其自潰作用呢！（丁：譯自四月三十日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>日陸軍報道部發言人　批評協約誇誕宣傳</h3>
<p>日本在上海號軍部報道部，於昨（十三）日下午三時，循例招待本市中國新聞記者團常會，即席由發言人就敵協約陣綫對羅邱會見作無聊　大之宣傳，加以批評稱。此次協約方面利用北非情勢，主張開闢歐洲</p>
<p>第二戰綫之說，甚　鏖上，而美海軍部長諾克斯復於會見新聞記者時詭稱，利用北非情勢，不僅可威脅西西里島，且將來更可威脅地中海云云，此雖爲協約方面之希望，但事實上能吾辦到，尙屬疑問，蓋在未恢復其旣喪失之制空權以前，縱使有何計劃，亦無異痴人說夢，斷難實現。此外，開闢歐洲第二戰綫，在種種關係之下，其對巴爾幹之外交問題，即感棘手，無法進行，一昨英倫向渝方作誇誕之廣播，前後兩段，顯示得意失望，再根述英從軍記者報吿軍力配備之不足，且士氣方面不逮日軍速甚。總之，羅邱之一再會議，上次於卡薩白朗加會見時，以反攻緬甸作基點，結果</p>
<p>仍歸失敗　此次會談，或將陰謀以太平洋作資料矣，我人以現實情勢而論，其結果當又歸失敗無疑，此乃可預言者，據昨日電訊所傳，羅邱之會見，蘇聯史太林及渝方將介石並未參輿，此種會談，在史蔣立塲上言，難免不發生問題，而渝方于斌主敎在美外交會議席上，謂美在太平洋作戰迄今，一味保持守勢，不圖振作攻勢，頗使渝方爲之失望，冀望美能採取攻勢，故此次羅邱之會談，渝方與美之關係，已可槪見矣。此次會談之中心，是否係商談太平洋問題，在事實未揭曉前、，我人固未便置論，但其主要目的，或將奪取緬甸，假定能成事實，但能否爲渝方解決一切困難，是一難題。末謂美在渝空軍與渝方爭奪指揮權甚烈，故捷諾德此次之返美，乃不得已求之於華府。</p>

<h3>滬混合隊在北平　力克北華隊　比數一對零</h3>
<p>（北平通訊）上海華人混合足球隊，旣以三對一擊敗東風隊，（九日）又在先農壇公共體育塲，與華北隊會戰。上海爲華中之代表隊，其中虎將李天生·孫錦順·賈幼良·均係曾經出席世運之名手，而北華隊亦集京·津·靑島三地之猛將而成，若李風樓，李朝權，徐護民，譚福順等，胥爲華北足球界之俊俊者，故球迷聞風到塲者達二萬人以上。雙方鬥爭，非常緊張，兩隊或攻或守，相持不下，直至前牛時終了前，上海隊始由李義臣攻入一球，遂造成一對〇紀錄，休息後再行交鋒，北華隊大取攻勢，並得順風之助，屢有射門機會。上海隊門前險象環生，幸劉顯漢身手靈活，救出不少險球。北華隊曾命中一球，惜因越位被判作廢。直至終塲，雙方均無建樹。結果上海隊以一對〇力挫北華。上海隊十四日赴津。　昨日本報發報時間七點四十分</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>「經濟上海」</h3>
<p>日本的名經濟學者武內文彬先生，主張建設「經濟上海」，認爲這一個問題，是握金中國經濟復興建設之鍵的。他的結論是：「這次轉換外交，經濟的目的，就是「經濟上海」的建設，斷不容建設在他處。』</p>
<p>武內先生的立意公允，論列精闢，是不用再說的，爲什麽要建設「經濟上海」？也是不用冉說的。我們所願檢討的一點，就是怎樣去建設「經濟上海』？武內先生在他的結論中，指出關於建設「經濟上海」的悲觀論，—就是上海的經濟，從來依靠貿易；斷絕的貿易，旣然不易恢復，現在祇有上海是否可用存貨來延長經濟壽命的問題。可楚，武內先生對於這種謬論的批評，有句「一針見血」的話，就是「祗知從來的上海經濟依靠貿易，遂誤斷中國沒有自給自足的力量。」</p>
<p>建設「經濟上海」的原動力，即在於「自給自足」，而「自給自足」的必要條件，即在於促進生產。戰前的上海，是依附貿易生存的；人民在衣，食，住，行，各方面所需要的，有的是外國貨，於是上海竟成爲一面倒的消耗者，從來不向工業生產之途，努力邁進，殊爲遺憾。自從大東亞戰爭以來，上海因爲失去了貿易依存的性格，遂乃積極從事於各種生產的推進，以期自給自足。舉一兩個最簡明的例來說罷：如關係人民健康問題的藥，以現在上海新藥業的發達情形而言，差不多是可以自給了；又如關係日常交通問題的自由車，以現在上海自由車業的製造能力而言，也差不多是可以自給了。由此看來，上海自給自足的力量，絕對不是沒有，而且是十分强大的。有人會問：上海以貿易港的地位，變爲工業都市以後，是否可以不需要貿易的輔助，便能自給自足？答復這個問題首須明瞭建設「經濟上海」的意義，是在於復興中國經濟，安定中國民生，進而至於完成中日經濟共興；那末，上海與中國各地區，以及上海與大東亞共榮圈諸地域的物資交流，當然不能不成爲建設「經濟上海」的必要條件。換句話說，上海的工業力，絕對少不來共榮圈諸地域的原料，而中國腹地的經濟支配力，也絕對少不來上海地域的產品。因此「經濟上海」雖不因失去以前所依靠的貿易，而有所顧　於其自給自足的地位，可是，維持上海工業生產力所必需要的貿易，—在共榮圈以內的—則仍然不能不予以圓滑的推進。</p>
<h3>本市金融界發起　農村銀團組織內容</h3>
<p>增强農業生產，首重確立對農村金融體制，交通銀行有鑒及此，前曾發表「農村銀團」之組織計劃，頗引起各方面注目事，頃自己獲得農村金融之具體辦法成案，預定最近呈報國府施該項計劃。</p>
<p>溯交通銀行去歲年末依據實業部指示，於本年一月底開始調查蘇浙皖和平地區實態，並敦促上海各著名大銀行加入農村金融團，頃已得各方面在原則上之同意，基於第一次調查報告，商得農村貸放具體辦法之成案，該項成案尙未發表，但主要內容大致如次：</p>
<p>參加銀行　據揣測大致以交通銀行爲中心，中國金城鹽業等數行亦加入，惟農村金融較商業金融，利潤較薄，且須長期採取低利率，有關當局亦擬限定金融性質二十餘家有力銀行得加入該團。一</p>
<p>供求定額　預料第一期（五年）定爲融資十億元，關於上項融資，財政部與中央備備銀行間對原則上亦已成立諒解。</p>
<p>貸款方法　以往農村金融失敗之主因，因金融機關與農民之中間介有地主，高利貸資本等，致農村金融之利益橫被剝奪，此次將依循下列之方途，（甲）並不全面利用旣存合作社，僅限於被視爲最有信譽者，以此爲貸款對象，如無鞏固基礎合作社之農村，則在該銀團監督指導下組織金融合作社以爲貸款對象。（乙）監督指導合作社之運營以期其適當，藉防止商業資本存在之餘地，儘量保持利率之低輕而利率之輕重分農民，農塲及農業企業等之階段，以農民貸款利率最低，其次較高，各視地方實際情形而決定之。又預定本月底派遣第二次調查隊前往各地以勘定設置該金融團辦事所之地點云。</p>
<h3>中國交通等銀行　農村貸款處將成立</h3>
<p>本市中國，交通曁江蘇，上海市復興等四銀行，聯合舉辦農村貸款，一切工作，正在積極準備進行中，四行之『農村貸款處』亦定於本月中旬宣吿設立，然後絡續設立內地各處之『農村貸款分處』。</p>
<h3>行莊註冊一律　限期完成</h3>
<p>財政部爲安定金融，統一管理金融機關起見，頒布管理金融機關暫行條例及施行細則實施後，各金融機關（如銀行錢莊及信托公司）均雖依照條例之規定辦理申請登記註冊，及補行登記註册，經財部核準發給營業執照後方准營業，現經財政部有關檢查金融之機關查悉，本市各銀行錢莊已經呈准註冊頒給執照營業者固佔多數，其未經辦理申請登記呈准註册之銀行錢莊而擅自營業者不下五十餘家，似此違反法令情形，妨碍金融推進影響甚大，故擬會商財部駐滬機關，督飭各該銀行錢莊速於八月中旬限期內，一律依法辦理申請登記註册手續，逾限後，即當嚴予取締，不准營業。</p>
<h3>江海關考慮聯繫滬郊　轉口稅徵收所</h3>
<p>江海關方面已在考慮加强分設於滬市四周之轉口稅徵收所之聯繫，蓋最近常有販子掩過各轉口稅徵收所之耳目而偷運物資，尤以徐家滙一帶已數見不鮮，爲杜絕此項弊病起見，今後凡發覺在禁止通行之路上通行時，一律根據防止偷運規定嚴辦。（五月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>再度澈查囤積聲中　黑市將遭嚴厲取締</h3>
<p>最近再度特派大員澈查囤積，並公佈囤積治罪條例，盛傳對黑市將採取强硬取締方針，故黑市一度稍見跌落，雖云若干物價停止狂漲之風，然一二三四月之平均黑市，仍堪驚人，衆皆認爲抑平物價，淸除黑市，唯有秉公澈查，期使物價回落至一月份之價格。</p>
<p>查各物之黑市中，僅食米一項，有回小現象，此亦可認爲係國府發行糧食庫券之國家管理米毅的一種成功，由於此種經騐，則對於主要物資，允以棉紗棉布等，亦盼發行商品庫劵，實行國家管理。</p>
<p>目下雜糧步步向榮，輿米價之低落適成反比例，結果農民將不重產米，祗求自己之够用，移用精力於生產雜糧，向市上傾銷，刻下各方均在考慮物價統制之均衡化。（譯自五月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>經濟局同派林科長　出席春靈研究會議</h3>
<p>實業部爲決定本年度之春蠶收買價格，特定本月十五日，在京召開蠶價評定會議，並通令蘇浙兩省建設廳，蘇淮蘇北及上海南京兩特別市有關長官，及華中蠶絲會社，推派代表出席與議，茲悉本市經濟局奉到市政府轉令後，業巳派第五科科長林弢，晋京出席，並携有提案多件。</p>

<h3>本市小麥商　昨集議採麥方策</h3>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股市態軟化，在求現賣勢下，更在貨物一致低落聲中，人心向下。百貨業最爲虛疲，永安，新新，國貨三公司多見續小三元至五元。新藥業跌後於午刻爲有力投資者收吸新亞藥廠中法藥房各小五角，舫織業之永安紗廠供方忽殷，削十元，美亞綢廠亦小四元，公用業之閘北水　與華商電氣最爲呆滯，雖少買戶，售者亦不肯廉脫也。南洋烟公司及大中華火柴平疲，久安實業及新益地產亦軟，文化業世界書局較堅定，少售出，商務與中華書局均平。中國磚瓦即將將增資，市見活躍。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>金屬業　金屬業同業公會聯合會自經實業部指定發起人後，由召集人周仲慶召集發起人，於昨（十三）日舉行第一次籌備會議，實業部派監理官孫祖基，及商統會秘書長張佩紳均出席指導，並討論修正章程草案，及其他關係組織上之重要案件畢，即茶點散會。</p>

<p>— 志武</p>
<p>「小不忍圳亂火謀」。古人立身處世，對於這句格言，是深引爲戒的。</p>
<p>項藉匹夫之勇，處事不能忍，得韓信而不能用，雖能百戰百勝，但輕用其鋒，故終有「烏江自刎」的下塲。劉邦深謀遠慮，處事能忍，能容納謀士張良陳平諸人，養其全鋒，以待其敝，故終能奪取中原，稱王天下。做人做事，成功得失，全介乎能忍與不能忍的關鍵。故范蠡不殉會稽之恥，曹沫不死三敗之辱，卒復勾踐之仇，報魯國之羞。能忍一朝的忿怒，終能湔雪百年的恥辱，歷史上是不乏先例的。</p>
<p>像季子不禮於其嫂，買臣見棄於其妻，韓信曾受袴下之辱，一個人屈不得志，困阨閭里，或生活潦倒時，隨時都有受着庸人俗子侮辱的可能。但他們都能堅忍一時，發奮地創造出偉大的前程，他們成功的條件，完全在把握着能忍與不能忍之間。所以，「匹夫見辱，拔劍而起，挺身而鬥」，道種人，是不足稱爲勇的。大勇的人，有忍辱負重的器度，「卒然臨之而不　，無故加之而不怒，，此其所以挾持者甚大，而其志甚遠也」</p>
<p>孟子曰：「天將降大任於是人也，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨，餓其體膚，空乏其身，行拂亂其所爲，所以動心忍性，增益其所不能」。所謂「苦其心志」，「動心忍性」……等，是做人立身處世的重要秘訣。故人能嚼得菜根，則百事可爲。古往今來偉大事業，都是從艱苦堅忍中奮鬥長成。設使蘇秦有洛陽負郭田二頃，怎能有封佩六國相印之日！</p>
<p>有忍耐涵養的人，才能臨事不亂，寵辱不騖。荀子說：「行忍性然後能修」，確是做人處世一句千古的金科玉律。</p>
<h3>「成功者」</h3>
<p>— 沈鐘</p>
<p>買進，買進，一片買進聲，於是隨着的是漲價，漲價，像瘋了般的在漲，道樣便造了一批——在整個多數中的少數——「成功者」暴發戶。</p>
<p>暴發戶的增多，雖是更加重了手無「寸金」的小百姓底壓榨，也就是更多的犧牲，但這在「成功者」心目中却認爲是必然的，簡直是絕對的事，於是「成功者」們得意地笑了</p>
<p>假使有「不識相」的「呆子」「理直氣壯」的提出否認來底話，同時更提出些「芷義」「道德」，「悖入者悖出」等一類的「酸話」來說法，我們的「成功者」可就得搬出一句「古已有例」的「名言」——一將成功萬骨枯——來塞沒你的嘴巴。</p>
<p>眞的「呆子！」我們的「成功者」還可以更進一步的解釋你聽，「市塲」與「戰塲」何嘗不是同一「原理」，誰叫你手無「寸金」，否則的話，你何嘗沒有「一將成功」的希望。</p>
<p>「一將成功」旣得「萬骨枯」，則一個暴發戶的「成功」便得「萬人餓」。</p>
<p>於是，朋友，你尙欲何言，除了等着做餓殍外。（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3>「萬世流芳」觀後</h3>
<p>— 爭榮</p>
<p>宣傳經年的「萬世流芳」，終於獻映在影迷們的眼前。這是「鴉片戰爭」的史跡，有一個血淋淋的事實，給與人們不可湮沒的敎訓。鴉片之戰的結束，訂立了最初辱國的南京條約，而鴉片的流毒，至今未滅，誠不勝遺憾！無限痛恨也。這史實的映出，將要震動了千千萬萬同胞的心弦，怒吼起來。當此東亞民族振奮自拔的時候，我覺得人人都有一看的價値。</p>
<p>「萬世流芳」劇本的編寫，甚足以動人，對白的有力和諷刺性的嚴重，令人痛悲，而可以深刻在每個人的心版上的。當時英國人的無理，鬼計多端及種種强暴行動，切齒可恨，而使人髮指。及至林公則徐拜命欽差大臣，專辦嚴禁鴉片運入，與英人以對峙之勢，查辦私運，英人的奸謀從此受重大打擊。和張靜嫻製戒烟丸普救世人，並樹立「平英團」義旗，爲朝庭後盾，都足以促人興奮的幾幕。</p>
<p>演員方面，高占非的林則徐，最有力量，沉着穩練，態度嚴正，淋漓盡致，肅然敬之。王引的潘達年，前以沉迷烟霞，不圖進展，後覺醒戒除惡嗜，爲國效力，豪邁俊朗，富有生氣，仍不失硬派作風。李香蘭的鳳姑，悽苦活潑，憐之愛之，歌曲兩支，婉轉動聽。陳雲裳的張靜嫻，以巾幗英雄之姿態演出，英武之氣，溢於眉宇，亦使人振奮。袁美雲的鄭玉屛，善於描摹，如泣如訴，撼動觀衆心靈。嚴俊的葉利阿妥蒙納的瑪琍安娜，表情陰險刁猾，尙稱職。其他各演員也都有特殊演出。</p>
<h3>三頭主義</h3>
<p>— 胤子</p>
<p>生存在現社會，每個人總要有些立身處世之方，方才不致處處吃虧。歸納現社會許多身價十倍者，大都不出下列三頭。　即一，排頭，二噱頭，三拳頭。排頭硬，眞是處處佔便宜。位置寫意，事情輕鬆，沾便宜不會漏綽，做錯事情也不會有大不了的風險。人家既恭而敬之，而又謙遜不遑，風頭之健，無出其右。</p>
<p>說到噱頭，這是嘴上功夫，若能運用靈敏，也的確可以八面玲瓏！自身本領學問雖然有限，可是憑着一張嘴，天花亂墜，死事也會活現，團團兜得轉呢！</p>
<p>要是並此一者也沒有，那末也得用粗的拳頭。一言不合，捲衣勤袖，大咆一聲，『老子答應這毛拳可不答應』，這樣一來，也足以嚇得對方毛骨凛凛，知道不是好惹，乖人不吃眼前虧，馬上看風轉舵，從此也要刮目相看吧！</p>
<p>生來旣無排頭，心地耿直，噱頭毫無，纖纖弱質，馴順似羔羊，那自然默默無聞，處處吃虧哩！</p>
<h3>漫言</h3>
<p>— 靜文</p>
<p>惡劣的社會環境，並不値得憤根，因爲這是人生必經的過程，所謂「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人」豐盛的結果，原藏在荊棘叢中。</p>
<p>火石不經摩擦，火花永遠不會發出。同樣，人們沒有受重大的刺激，則生命的火燄，也是永遠不會燃燒！</p>
<h3>五大連池遊記</h3>
<p>— 加藤美生</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>北滿勝景五大連池，爲阻塞十四座配列火山丘的大池，人跡罕至，本篇爲該火山地帶之實地寫照。</p>
<p>筆者此次自一月中旬至二月上旬，參加爲關東軍報道隊員，在酷寒期的北滿地方受訓，並得到了實地視察許多北滿事情的機。</p>
<p>滿洲與蘇聯僅隔着一條黑龍江，將士們在零下四十度極寒期的滿蘇國境的生活狀况，不但他們的父母，兄弟，姊妹們，即全體民衆也都是渴望明瞭的。天空凝重得像鉛一般沉重，大地舖滿粉堆玉琢的晶雪，沙沙地踏着被前人足跡所踏溶了的黑土上走着，走着，眼睛所能見到的。是一片冰天雪地的大平原，而在那平原中，躺着被人們遺忘般似的營房。軍士在那裏志樣過活的呢？見慣了本國那樣齊整繁盛的建築物，一見到此地的荒凉景象，首先被同情激起胸頭的感動。跨進營房，這些危懼的念頭，頓時消滅了。充滿着活力的兵士們，跑近來用渴念祖國的目光貪婪地望着筆者們。</p>
<p>「內地的精神大概仍很旺盛罷！」</p>
<p>兵士們雖在遼遠的邊地，可是仍苦戀地想念着祖國的現在。南方的戰友，保持了南方的進展，國民的團結，鞏固了戰綫的後方，此地的兵士們，則固守北圉。鍛鍊自己，片刻也不敢解怠於耐寒訓練，培養鬬志，是此地的兵士們所報答於後方的國民（北方的兵士常似運動選手般不絕地獨自在練習跑步，鍛鍊體格。所以一旦有敵人出現的時候，人人都抱有絕對可以戰勝　自信與實力。在冰天雪地的大自然環境中，時時刻刻與寒魔作苦戰而克服之。這在年輕的兵士們看來，恰似與敵人白刃相接般的精神鬬爭。</p>
<p>兵士們儘量找尋娛樂來安慰自己，譬如栽花，養鳥，組織演劇　，音樂團等等。北方的兵士們在這自然的猛威與環境下不能不耐受這種磨練，後方的國民，唯有加緊後方的活動，與前綫聯成一氣，始足以報答北圉將士的勞苦於萬一，筆者視察歸來後，謹捧呈感激之忱於北圉將士之前。</p>
<p>筆者想報吿一點北滿軍隊耐寒兵器及兵士們之科學上的硏究，雖其詳細不十分明瞭，且也沒有發表的自由，但仍想把視察北滿大山地帶的「冬的五大速池及配列火山」訪問記向讀者提出。</p>
<p>「北滿有地震嗎？」能確確實實回答的人有幾個呢？然而據紀錄，北滿決不是沒有地震的土地。</p>
<p>旅順工業大學的調查報吿</p>
<p>上說：「滿洲火山羣集於二處。南滿自龍岡起經伊通而至鄭家屯，東西三百籽間，有火山的二十個。在北滿地方，以北滿省墨爾根爲中心，在本經五十籽的範圍內，有火山的四十個。其餘七十多個內休火山則在長白山及五十連池二處。此外完全是死火山。」</p>
<p>我們一行計報道班員，記者班（新聞。雜誌。作家）美術班。攝影班。及實習班（國民學校訓導）多名，身携防寒具，腰掛短劍，由警備兵若干名引導，踴躍向現地開始進發。承北安省公署的好意，隊員得乘長途汽車，追隨於軍隊的載重車之後。在某部隊衛兵所前的揭示板上，指示着現時的溫度是零下三十二度。在坦蕩的北滿原野上走着，走着，我們的四圍，祗看見一條無邊無際的地平綫。雖然在汽車中，圍着圍巾，戴着防寒帽，我們的鼻毛都凍結起來，鬚髭結成白色的霜柱。是那樣廣僻的地方，幾十里不看見一個部落。手指足指都凍得麻木了。汽車走了的牛小時，因爲要取暖，我們就下車來，跟在汽車後而走，等走得有點暖和了，再乘車。穿過德都縣城，波諾穆爾河（譯音）更向北走約二十粁的地點，見到了形似仰缽般的山丘。這就是我們所欲探訪的「五大連池配列火山丘」的起點。五大連池在德都縣內（東經百二十六度七分，北緯四十八度四十三分），原名烏雲和爾各吉火山，康熙五十九年這十四個火山中，有火燒山。老黑山二處發生大爆發，溶岩液向低地在奔，形成大池，噴火後七日，這溶岩液始凝固云。</p>
<p>這就是住民們附會了許多傳說（其一說黑龍與金龍相鬥）而稱之爲石龍熔岩。十四個山面積不大，各有各的火山口，石龍熔岩在面積上相等日本九州櫻島的三·七倍，容積〇·七倍，岩質上面是中生層及玄武岩下面是漆黑或藍黑色的橄欖輝石，及微密而有孔質的玻璃岩其色澤與形狀成爲五連池的特殊背景，恰如龍呑水的模樣，所以就叫這地點是石龍熔岩流。我們爲要看淸這熔岩流及五大連池，遂沙沙地踏着粉雪。登藥泉山。這山的標高不過三五八米，牛山濯濯，四面看不見一點東西，可以淸楚而隨心所欲地眺望配列火山丘的遠景。吹過山頂的北風，似銳利的針，直透過我們的防寒具。我們眺望這十四個火山丘，在這大目然的神秘之　，低下頭來了</p>
<p>藥泉山不僅是一塊適於眺望的塲所，在此山的火口底，並有一座建築物（錡靈寺），內有怪像五楝，很有名。爲　紀念民族鬥爭的歷史，即漢。蒙民族的盛衰，故「把這地方當作靈塲。此話似難於　信。不過民國十八年有所謂老一和尙者，在此山山麓建　靈寺，以爲北安省拜泉縣法輪寺的下院。更費了十一年的時間，在拜泉縣鐘靈觀的境內，安置了古今東西聖大，賢者，忠臣孝子等與眞身同樣大小的余銅佛座像一百四十六尊，童像六十一尊，建起寺院來，使五大速池聖神化。奉祀的佛像中，有釋迦，基督，孔子，亞倍，瑪利亞，阿利斯多德，竹林七賢等，但日本的聖賢一個也沒有，頗堪注目。在連結藥泉山與熔岩地帶的東西一千二百米之問的草原地帶，隨地有炭酸泉。到春天，蒙古人老遠的用大車載了家族到此地來，在這泉中齋戒沐浴，用貝杓子汲泉而飲，據說冷泉對胃腸病有奇效，並是洗滌身心的齷齪的靈泉。（翔：譯自三月號科學書報）</p>

        <h1>1943.05.14</h1>
<h3>Prospects for the European and Asian War Situation</h3>
<p>The year 1943 will be the year of decisive battles in this world war, and also the year that determines the future world situation. While it is difficult to definitively confirm this view right now, judging from all the movements of the belligerent parties since the Lunar New Year, the thoroughness of their preparations, the comprehensiveness of their mobilization, and the importance that all parties attach to the future war situation, we can conclude that the scale and significance of the summer war that is about to unfold will be unprecedented.</p>
<p>First, concerning the North African war situation, the retreat of the Axis forces from Tunisia and Bizerte has already begun a pivotal shift. That is, the North African war situation is no longer one of the focal points of the world war; this focal point has shifted to the Mediterranean. Since this spring, under the pressure of the overwhelming strength of the anti-Axis forces, the Axis forces in North Africa, under the command of Generals Rommel and Arnim, have waged the most arduous struggle, buying several months of time so that the work of "fortifying the European continent" could be completed in an orderly manner. In addition to this main task, the Axis forces also had two major tasks: (1) To give the anti-Axis forces as much of a blow and attrition as possible, pre-emptively weakening the fighting will and strength of the Anglo-American forces to invade the European continent; (2) To preserve the excellent combat capabilities of the Axis forces in North Africa as much as possible so that in the most critical situation, they could be transferred to other strategic points in the Mediterranean or European positions. To date, the anti-Axis propaganda apparatus has not been able to point out the fact that the North African Axis forces have failed to complete the above-mentioned tasks. Secondly, after the withdrawal from Tunisia and Bizerte, as Gada, the chief writer of the Italian newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo, pointed out: "The war of Anglo-American imperialists has gradually shifted from the African continent to the European continent" (Rome telegram from the Central News Agency on the 11th). However, here we cannot ignore the following three facts: (1) Even the propaganda dispatches of the Anglo-Americans cannot but admit that at present, the Axis forces still have a large force of more than 100,000 troops in the southeastern mountains of Tunisia and the Cape Bon Peninsula, maintaining their strong combat power. This is a powerful restraint on Anglo-American aggression against the European continent. (2) As Gada pointed out in the above-quoted article: "The Axis forces have now completed their European defense plan. This can be proved by future facts." It is a big question whether the Anglo-American forces, whose consistent strategy is to take advantage of opportunities, and who have not yet completed the closest and seamless unity in strategy and command, will blindly move forward lightly. (3) General Franco of Spain's call for peace (Lisbon telegram from the Central News Agency on the 10th), and Turkish Prime Minister Saracoglu's statement regarding the transition from absolute neutrality towards Britain to restoring non-belligerent status (as published in the evening edition of the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on the 11th), these subtle political or diplomatic developments cannot be ignored for their role in easing the war situation. Therefore, while we should point out the possibility of European warfare and the inevitability of its unfolding future, we must also point out that the focus of the recent war situation is still on the Mediterranean naval and air war and the submarine war in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Looking at the German-Soviet battlefield again, it has been almost silent for nearly two months since late March. During this period, common sense can tell us that both sides are preparing for large-scale operations in the future. The Axis forces' preparations seem to have taken longer than the Soviet Union's. They have stopped their offensive since the winter of 1942 and are preparing for a second major offensive, while the Red Army was still engaged in intense combat until mid-March of this year. Therefore, the effectiveness of the strategic preparations of the two sides will naturally not be equal. In terms of space, the scope of Germany's total mobilization and the limitation of the Soviet Union to the historically weak area east of the Urals can be clearly seen by comparing the world map. As for the quality, including both spiritual mood and material equipment, it is naturally not easy to judge lightly, but according to German experts: "The Soviet Union's thorough mobilization of men and active expansion of military industry to fill the personnel and material losses suffered in the winter war has largely been successful, but this is a quantitative aspect, and the qualitative aspect of the soldiers is far lower than when the winter counter-offensive began; the Soviet army seems to have restored its previous strength in terms of weapons and equipment, and its heavy weapons have been greatly enhanced." (Berlin telegram from the Central News Agency on the 11th) Judging from the above aspects of time, space, and quality, it can be seen that it seems impossible for the Soviet Union to cooperate with the United Kingdom and the United States and launch an offensive in the summer. On the contrary, although the Axis forces have increased their attention to defense in the Mediterranean and Europe, generally speaking, their strategic goal has never shifted from the Eastern Front. Therefore, the decisive war will still be played out on the Eastern Front, and the day of its arrival will be sooner.</p>
<p>Finally, we have always attached importance to the decisive impact of the East Asian war situation on the world war. The biggest concern for the United Kingdom and the United States in their strategic plan to invade the European continent is the rapid expansion of Japanese military and political power in the Pacific. What the heads of the anti-Axis forces have been concerned about recently is mainly "where Japan will attack tomorrow." Their estimates roughly fall into the following three points: (1) The opening of the northern route, which the United Kingdom and the United States are promoting, and which contains the malicious intention of provoking Japanese-Soviet relations. (2) The southern route, advancing into Australia. Recently, not only the Australian authorities are terrified, but also the Anglo-American Pacific operations authorities are constantly crying for help. (3) The western route, the recent victory in the operation on the Burmese-Indian border, has further increased the threat felt by the United Kingdom and the United States. Comprehensively, the anti-Axis forces' mood of being terrified at every sound deeply depicts their loss of fighting spirit and predicament in the Pacific. In fact, the Japanese army has indeed maintained absolute initiative and maintained a superior position from which it can launch offensives in any direction. When the world war situation begins a new transformation, it will not neglect the opportunity to win greater victories. As for the recent political renewal and strengthening of the total war system, in diplomacy, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China, Manchuria, and the Philippines, and Minister Aoki's visits to various parts of the South Seas, as well as new measures in internal and external economy, have all shown the thoroughness and perfection of preparations for the decisive battle in the near future, and the fuller tension of the national power of Japan and East Asia. As we discuss this, what we feel guilty and uneasy about is that the strength that our China has exerted before this serious overall situation is too limited. In particular, the Yu Communist regime continues to resist stubbornly, which is extremely unfortunate from the perspective of our country, and should arouse a sense of self-blame from the perspective of China's responsibility to the world. The recent two-stage offensives by the Japanese China Expeditionary Force in the Jin-Yu border area, the Jin-Cha-Ji border area, and the southwest bank of Dongting Lake clearly illustrate the need for China to further invigorate its own strength to assist Japan in advancing its future strategy. Here, we not only hope for the awakening and efforts of our compatriots in the peaceful areas, but also hope that our compatriots under the Yu Communist regime will recognize the reality, get rid of the shackles, and jointly sacrifice and struggle, embark on the bright road, and jointly seek the true liberation of the East Asian nations in the dramatic transformation of the world war situation.</p>

<h3>Supreme National Defense Council Passes Resolution to Organize Materials Investigation Committee Composed of Sixteen Chinese and Japanese Members Headed by Mr. Chen Gongbo</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) The following are excerpts from the major cases resolved by the 14th Supreme National Defense Council at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th of this month: (1) The Chairman submitted a draft outline of the organization of the Materials Investigation Committee for public decision, which was approved. (The organizational outline of the Materials Investigation Committee and the list of our country's members are recorded separately.)

(3) The Chairman submitted a case from the Secretariat approving the Central Political Committee Secretariat's submission of the Executive Yuan's proposal to specially appoint Zhou Longxiang, Political Counselor of the National Government and Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as a member of the committee for receiving the French Concession, which was submitted to the 161st Executive Yuan meeting and approved. In addition to submitting it to the National Government for special appointment, the case is recorded and submitted for review and ratification. (4) Wu Ruiyuan is appointed as a member of the National Economic Commission. (5) National dress shall only have the original system of line grading due to the existence of medals and medal ribbons, and shall uniformly use a three-row, five-column tic-tac-toe silver line on the right lapel. (1) For national dress, the medal ribbon is worn horizontally on the right lapel, the same as military uniforms. Other formal attire, such as the regular blue robe and black jacket, and women's national dress have round medal ribbons worn on the lapel. (2) The Chinese National Government orders the wearing of medals during celebrations. (3) From June 1st to September 30th, the national dress will be changed to summer white, but local officials may make changes according to the climate.</p>
<p>List of Chinese Members The Materials Investigation Committee has a total of sixteen members, including the chairman, specially appointed by both China and Japan. In addition to the chairman, Chen Gongbo, the Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, one member from both China and Japan will be designated as standing committee members. The list of members from our country is: (1) Chairman Chen Gongbo, Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, (2) Member Yuan Yuqian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, (3) Chen Zhishuo, Director of the Ministry of Finance, (4) Zhao Shuyong, Secretary-General of Shanghai Special Municipality, (5) Chen Yunwen, Supervisor of the National Commercial Control Association, (6) Lu Ying, Director of the Shanghai Special Police Bureau, (7) Wang Zhigang, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, (8) Economic Advisor Colonel Okada.</p>
<p>List of Japanese Members Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) After the Chinese Chairman and members of the Materials Investigation Committee were decided and announced at the 14th Supreme National Defense Council, it is now learned that the list of Japanese members was also announced by the Japanese Embassy on the 13th. It is recorded as follows: Minister Tajiri stationed in Shanghai, Ishii, Director of the Economic Department of the Embassy, Nagai, Colonel of the Military Headquarters, Yano, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Yamazaki, Lieutenant Colonel of the Shanghai Military Police, Fukuchi, Lieutenant Colonel of the Naval Fleet, Inagaki, Deputy Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, and Inagaki, Director of the Materials Control Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Their future tasks will be to investigate and recommend important materials and implement the matters stipulated in the Materials Investigation Regulations.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) The 14th Supreme National Defense Council passed the resolution to organize the Materials Investigation Committee, which will greatly benefit the investigation of materials and the crackdown on hoarding, and will also be closely linked to the stability of people's livelihoods. Now that this case has been passed by the Supreme National Defense Council, the materials investigation will definitely make more concrete progress. It is found that the Chinese and Japanese members are all official authorities, and the place where materials are most concentrated is Shanghai. It is appropriate to have Chen Gongbo, the Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, as the Chairman of the Materials Investigation Organization Committee. In addition, the Chinese members include the Vice Ministers of Industry and Finance, Yuan and Chen, the Supervisor of the National Commercial Control Association, Chen, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Directors of the Police and Economic Bureaus, who have also been given new missions as members, and are supplemented by Economic Advisor Colonel Okada, which can be said to be a well-equipped lineup. The Japanese side is headed by Tajiri, the Japanese Minister stationed in Shanghai, and includes appropriate personnel from the Embassy General Headquarters and the Navy, as well as the Deputy Commissioner of the Municipal Council Police and the Director of the Economic Department, making it a powerful investigation agency. Everyone has great expectations for this.</p>

<h3>Military Inspection Group of the National Government Leaves Japan and Arrives in Shanghai with Ye Peng and His Entourage</h3>
<p>The military inspection group dispatched by the National Government to Japan, Army General Ye Peng, Sun Liangcheng, Hu Yukun, and Army Lieutenant General Xiang Zhizhuang, Yang Zhonghua, and his entourage, have thoroughly inspected the various military facilities of friendly countries since they went abroad across the sea, using them as a mirror to enhance our country's military strength after participating in the war. It is now learned that General Ye and others have completed their mission in Japan, and they safely returned to China by plane on the afternoon of the 12th. Lu Ying, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau and Deputy Commander of Security, and others went to the airport to greet them. After exchanging greetings, they were led to the official residence to rest. Last night, Lu held a banquet at his private residence, and the guests and hosts were very happy. It is said that Mr. Ye and others will stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Nanjing to meet the Chairman and report on the inspection in Japan.</p>
<p>The members of the group talk about their feelings after visiting Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) The military observation group sent to Japan by the Chinese National Government has made a detailed inspection of the war capital Tokyo and its surrounding areas, and the impression gained is very good. They have left here on the 12th to return to China. The following is the general idea of the impressions expressed by General Ye Peng, the head of the group, and others before their departure.</p>
<p>General Ye Peng (Minister of the Army of the National Government) said: I have gained a lot of impressions from this visit to friendly countries. In general, Japan in the decisive battle period has become a large barracks. In this large barracks, everyone and everything is moving in tension. In addition, with abundant resources and increased production, there is no shortage of materials, and it can indeed carry out a long-term war. The fighters in this large barracks all have the spirit of "life-or-death" and the belief that "the Greater East Asia War will be won." All of this can only make me admire. One thing worth mentioning is that when we visited a certain Japanese national school, the principal of the school personally acted as a guide. When we were walking to a certain wall, there was a water tap that was not turned off, and the water was gurgling. The principal immediately stepped forward and turned it off. Although this matter is small, the feeling is very deep, because it is enough to show the spirit of thrift and the seriousness and responsibility of the Japanese people in dealing with things. This is really worthy of our emulation. General Sun Liangcheng (Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army of the National Government) said: Before coming to Japan, I already had a good impression in my imagination. After arriving in Japan, I gained a clearer and deeper understanding after detailed inspection. In particular, the national spirit of the Japanese people in this decisive battle period is even more worthy of our admiration. In the past, China emphasized spirit, and Europe and the United States advocated material things, because they were all biased towards one end, so various evils also occurred. But Japan can just integrate spirit and material into one, using both inside and out, so it has today's strength and today's results. This is incomparable to any country. I have seen a lot during this visit to Japan. What I feel most deeply is the wisdom and perfection of the control policy. This is not a manifestation of the lack of materials, but a necessary countermeasure in wartime. Due to the rationality of the control methods, the Japanese people, regardless of their status, wealth, or poverty, can have an equal enjoyment and ensure the stability of their lives. There is an ancient Chinese saying, "We are not afraid of scarcity, but of inequality." Japan can just achieve this "equality." The so-called hoarding and profiteering for personal gain are unheard of in Japan, which is enough to reflect the stability of Japan's economy and people's livelihood in wartime.</p>
<h3>After the Offensive in Dongting Lake, the Japanese Army Achieves Great Results</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army launched an offensive in the Dongting Lake area, it has dealt a great blow to the central part of the Sixth War Zone of the Yu. According to the Yu, the Dongting Lake area and Sichuan Province are both (granary areas) of the Yu. Now, after this blow, the anxiety of the Yu can be imagined. According to the Yu telegram, the Yu Sweeping Report 13 also said that the Japanese army's operation in the Dongting Lake area has caused a deep blow and loss to the only remaining granary in the Hunan war zone, which is a huge economic wound. Therefore, the embarrassment of the Yu can also be seen from this.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 13th (Central News Agency) The 29th Army Group of the Yu was badly defeated by the Japanese army on the banks of Dongting Lake, and it seems to have collapsed. Only the senior cadres and officers escaped. According to the latest news received from the Hunan front, the Yu is quite anxious because the 29th Army Group lost its troops and land. Therefore, it has recently ordered Sun Lianzhong, the acting commander of the Sixth War Zone, to quickly save the decline. In addition, the Yu's 10th Army Group is afraid of the Japanese army's lightning warfare and is currently doing its best to defend the key points of Lixian and Jinshi in the northwest of Hunan Province, actively building fortifications.</p>
<p>Nantang, Hunan Province, 13th (Central News Agency) Nantang was occupied by the Japanese army on the 8th. Because the Yu army had implemented a scorched earth tactic, the entire city was reduced to ruins, and the residents had no homes to return to and were waiting to be fed. The situation was very tragic. After the Japanese army entered the city, they immediately provided relief. The general residents expressed their deep gratitude for this and decided to start construction work from the ashes of the scorched earth to seek the restoration of China. In addition, when the Yu army withdrew from Nantang, they were too embarrassed, so they left behind a large amount of wood used for building barracks and warehouses. The Japanese army plans to distribute part of it to the residents for building houses, and the rest will be used for building Hunan Province. The Japanese army has now obtained the assistance of the residents and formed a raft unit on the right bank of Jiudu, sailing upstream to a certain place.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Hata Visits Tong to Inspect the Qingxiang Area in Northern Jiangsu</h3>

<h3>Three Thousand Communist Party Members Declare Their Withdrawal from the Communist Party</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to information obtained by the Nanjing Continental News, the Chongqing-based newspaper (Jie Bao) published in Jiangxi Province reported that 3,000 members who had joined the CCP, feeling the contradiction in the CCP's theory of resistance, issued a joint declaration of withdrawal from the CCP. The above-mentioned incident occurred in the CCP's base camp, Jiangxi, which shows that our theory of harmony and transportation is correct. It is reported that the content of their declaration of withdrawal is as follows: Since the War of Resistance, the crimes of the CCP have been well known. The CCP's purpose of resistance is purely for their own selfish calculations, and our people are only sacrificed for them. In particular, the CCP's conspiracy has become increasingly exposed recently, and it is attempting to eliminate the Kuomintang and demand the cancellation of all legitimate administrative organizations of the government, almost intending to replace the existing political control forces. In order to fight against the CCP, we hereby declare our withdrawal. The above-mentioned departing cadres include (1) Huang Luping, former Secretary of the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Ganxin Southwest Special Committee, (2) Zhang Lu, Secretary of the Ganxi Northwest Special Committee, (3) Xu Liangshan, Secretary of the North Special Committee, (4) Shi Ping, Director of the Yuebian Youth Department, (5) Yang Fusheng, Secretary of the Gandong Special Committee, (6) Qiu Meifeng, Member of the Minbei Special Committee, etc., totaling nearly 3,000 people. It is worth noting that as our government regains governance in Jiangxi Province and its political power expands.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Restricts the Establishment of New Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Regarding the restriction on the establishment of new financial institutions in the Shanghai area, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement as early as December 18th of last year, stopping registration. More than several months have passed, but there are still a few new financial institutions opening one after another in the Shanghai urban area. The outside world does not know the truth, and there may be doubts about this. Therefore, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance about this matter, who gave a brief account of the actual situation, saying that since the Ministry issued a statement on December 18th of last year, stopping registration, all applications for new financial institutions in the Shanghai area that were submitted to the Ministry after December 18th of last year were rejected in order to achieve the government's policy of controlling finance. As for the fact that there are still a few financial institutions opening one after another in the Shanghai area after the registration was stopped, they were all submitted to the Ministry before December 18th of last year and had been approved for handling at various times. In addition, there are also partnership organizations and money shops that were approved by the Ministry to extend the deadline to change to joint-stock companies. They were delayed in opening due to the unfinished preparation for reorganization. They were not newly established with the approval of the Ministry after the registration was stopped. Therefore, a special announcement is issued to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Huazhong Railway Plans to Dig a Yangtze River Tunnel</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) Huazhong Railway Company recently plans to dig a tunnel under the Yangtze River to connect the Jinghu and Jinpu railways, and is currently investigating. Because there is a Yangtze River between Xiaguan and Pukou, it is very inconvenient for passengers to travel back and forth. In order to solve this transportation difficulty, it is planned to dig into the ground near Hepingmen Station and then cross the Yangtze River, and dig out north of Pukou Station on the north bank. The entire project will take five years, and the project cost will be 70 million Japanese yen. After this project is completed, Nanjing, Jinpu, Beijing, Xinjing, and Kyoto and other places will be directly transported.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Yitang's Speech to Reporters in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yitang, a member of the National Government of the Republic of China and former Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, after arriving in the north on the 11th, immediately visited Prime Minister Tojo and members of the Japanese government to express his gratitude for past Japanese assistance and held various cordial talks. At 5 p.m. on the 12th, he also hosted a press conference at the Imperial Hotel, stating in essence, "The purpose of my visit to Japan is to express my gratitude to the Japanese side for the assistance given to me during my tenure as Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and to observe the wartime situation in Japan. China joined the war in January of this year and is cooperating with Japan to defeat Britain and the United States. The entire country is under the leadership of Chairman Wang, and everyone is actively working in their respective positions, devoting all their efforts to cooperate with Japan in all aspects of politics and economy to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. The current China, especially the North China region, is in the rear and bears an even greater mission. Before the National Government announced its participation in the war, North China actively assisted Japan. After the National Government's entry into the war, it has worked even harder to ensure public order, stability, and people's livelihood, in order to contribute to the enhancement of the Greater East Asia war effort. This time, Japan has changed its policy towards China, and the people of China have unanimously expressed their goodwill. The recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights have been the goals that the Chinese people have strived to achieve since the Opium War. Now, thanks to Japan's friendly measures, these goals have finally been realized, for which the Chinese people are particularly grateful. At the same time, China will certainly make even greater efforts to promote wartime policies in the future. Although I have now resigned from the post of Chairman of the North China Committee, given the importance of the current situation, I am determined to contribute to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, with my powers as a member of the National Government."</p>

<h3>Fierce Air War Over Sicily - 53 British and American Planes Shot Down in Three Days - Italian First Army Ordered to Cease Resistance</h3>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - Anti-Axis air forces have recently been bombing Sicily with "flying boxcars" or liberation-style heavy bombers, but each bombing has resulted in significant losses for the Anti-Axis forces. According to the Italian military authorities, a total of 53 enemy planes have been shot down by Axis fighter squadrons over Sicily in the past three days, and the total from the 1st to the 10th has reached 132.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement today: Another Axis hospital ship was attacked by Anti-Axis aircraft in the Tunisian waters. Qualified sources here pointed out that this type of attack has occurred ten times in eight days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - German military circles declared today that the Axis forces are still stubbornly resisting in the mountainous areas of Tunisia, but the German and Italian forces on the southern front have had to abandon resistance because they are out of ammunition and have no reinforcements. They are still able to inflict heavy damage on the enemy forces under the enemy's pincer attack.

<h3>Turkish Parliamentarians Reiterate Determination to Remain Neutral - All Able-bodied Men Must Not Evade Military Service - Some Government Agencies Moved Out of Ankara</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 13th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Sadak, the editor-in-chief of the famous Turkish newspaper Akşam, recently wrote an editorial stating: Turkey has no territorial ambitions or demands, and this principle has not changed to this day, because it is very satisfied with its own destiny and has no intention of changing its position. Turkey's armed neutrality policy is a wise move and will continue. The world should understand Turkey's position. It is regrettable that there have been some doubts raised recently by people at home and abroad. These people believe that once a second front is established in the Mediterranean or the Balkans, the most likely offensive and defensive routes for the belligerent countries will be through Turkey, and therefore they believe that Turkey will be forced to abandon its current policy. In fact, Germany will not change its relationship with Turkey while concentrating all its forces on the Eastern Front. Recalling that during the Balkan campaign, German troops stopped when they reached the Turkish border and immediately concluded a treaty of friendship with Turkey. Today, Turkey has gained the complete trust of the world and Germany.</p>
<p>Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to recent actions by the Turkish government, all able-bodied men of military age in Turkey will no longer be allowed to pay money to hire others to serve in the military in their place, as in the past. This income will no longer be included in the government's budget.</p>

For example, the Railway Administration will move to Istanbul, and the Forestry Administration will move to Bolu. After taking this measure, 4,000 households will leave Ankara.</p>

At the same time, the White House revealed today that post-war issues are also one of the topics of the meeting.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>British sources solemnly stated that although Lord Beaverbrook came to the United States on the same plane as Churchill, he was not among the entourage and was traveling to the United States in a private capacity.

Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen. Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling). As well as Roosevelt's personal representative in India, Philip, who is currently in Washington, may participate in the meeting.</p>
<p>Berlin Speculates That Politics Is More Important Than Military Affairs</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry announced today that Stalin's absence from the British-American meeting held in Washington indicates that the discord between the Anti-Axis countries still exists. The spokesman commented that the special feature of the meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill is the absence of the Soviet leader. In the past few weeks, British and American newspapers have advocated the necessity of holding consultations between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, but there has been no response from Moscow. This fact shows that the military personnel accompanying Churchill are only representative in nature, and the political issues that have arisen since the Casablanca Conference will undoubtedly occupy a prominent place in the negotiations. Therefore, Stalin's absence from the Washington meeting is only natural, which also proves that the Anti-Axis countries described by the United Nations are mistaken. After the Casablanca Conference, Britain and the United States assured the world that they had decided on the Anti-Axis military plan for the next nine months. It is now only April, so it can be assumed that this meeting is more political than military. (3) Abandoned farmlands, back</p>

<p>England is a nation established on the principle of thorough individualism. While this does not pose any significant obstacles during times of national peace and in the conduct of national affairs, it can suddenly become a fatal problem when the nation faces adversity. This is because individuals exist for the sake of the nation, and therefore, it is necessary to turn to individuals and demand that they exist for the sake of the nation. In England, when emergencies arise, acts of valor and public service, while not entirely absent, are merely exceptions.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, although the nation exists for the sake of the individual, maintaining this nation is essentially protecting the individual's interests. Therefore, an individual's sacrifice for the nation ultimately amounts to nothing more than an individual sacrificing for the individual. According to the Utilitarian philosophy, the individual should also be required to sacrifice for the nation.</p>
<p>For this reason, even at the crossroads of survival, England cannot implement conscription. Even if it does, it is only after the war has already intensified, and even then, it cannot be implemented effectively. Even at such times, the laborers engaged in manufacturing military supplies make improper or excessive demands of the government regarding wages; if their demands are not met, they do not hesitate to resort to strikes. In Japan, such actions would be regarded as treason against the nation; however, in England, no one finds such phenomena strange.</p>
<p>Napoleon was correct in calling the English "a nation of shopkeepers." The English are not an agile and vigorous nation. Although they have achieved great things, their nature, no matter what, cannot escape calculations of profit—they cannot escape the nature of a shopkeeper wearing an apron. This shopkeeper's nature and the pirate's nature complement each other, and this is the factor that has made England a great world empire.</p>
<p>However, it is also for that reason that England has forgotten agriculture, neglecting the fact that a halt in maritime transport would lead to starvation. During the outbreak of World War I, German submarines displayed their power. If the situation had continued for another two weeks, eight million Londoners would have starved to death.</p>
<p>Learning from past mistakes, England now has a considerable stockpile of food and other supplies, but that is not unlimited. Previously, planting potatoes in parks and wheat on golf courses were emergency measures, but they were only temporary solutions and did not fundamentally address the past.</p>
<p>The English were originally not ignorant of farming. Animal husbandry is a profession in which the English excel. Their wool is of the highest quality in Europe, and wool weavers in Flanders relied entirely on English raw materials. However, England, once known for its excellent wool, not only does not export it now, but even relies on imports from Europe and New Zealand to meet its domestic needs. During the mid-Victorian era, the repeal of the Corn Laws caused a great deal of controversy; fortunately, the repeal did not have as many negative effects as opponents had feared. Why is this? Because at that time, grain imported from foreign countries did not exceed 20% of domestic production.</p>
<p>However, fifty years have passed since then, and England has no choice but to rely on Canada. If we look back at the progress of all cultures, the first stage is hunting, the second is animal husbandry, and the third is farming; however, England has gone in the opposite direction. Farmlands have been turned into pastures, and pastures have been turned into hunting grounds. The departure of English farmers from the land did not begin recently; as early as the late 18th century, the poet Oliver Goldsmith wrote the poem "The Deserted Village," lamenting the fate of wandering farmers.</p>
<p>That trend has accelerated with time. The English upper class, whether the old aristocracy since the Norman Conquest or the new aristocracy supplemented by the tide of large-scale capitalism, cannot live without horse racing and hunting. They take pride in hunting foxes, deer, rabbits, pheasants, grouse, and wild ducks. They designate hunting areas of several or dozens of miles, employ hunting staff, and raise large numbers of birds and animals every year for entertainment during the hunting season. Therefore, it is not uncommon to hunt hundreds of deer or pheasants at a time.</p>
<p>In such a state, they treat the land entirely as a hunting ground, a racecourse, or a golf course. Who would feel the inspiration of "spring sunshine spreading its grace, and all things shining with glory"?</p>
<p>What is destroying England is precisely what made it prosperous. The English abandonment of their land led to success as merchants and industrialists, but it is also their abandonment of their land that has made them unable to maintain their position as merchants and industrialists.</p>
<p>Secondly, we cannot overlook the decline of religion. Christianity gave a touch of morality and spiritual style to the ferocious pirate nature of the Anglo-Saxons. In English history, what a weak king was Edward the Confessor? At the same time, what a devout king he was! He left a very deep mark on history.</p>
<p>The Puritan Revolution, in a sense, was a movement to defend the king or demand political freedom; economically, it was a question of land distribution or the amount of taxes; but it cannot be denied that it also became a religious issue. Seeley said:</p>
<p>"Even in Cromwell's time, just as in Elizabeth's time, commercial influence, disguised as religious influence, extended its power."</p>
<p>This is certainly true, and the influence of religion itself on individuals or the nation should not be despised. It is unjust to call Cromwell the worst of hypocrites. Cromwell, on the one hand, was the embodiment of the pirate and shopkeeper nature inherent in the Anglo-Saxons; on the other hand, he was a zealous Christian. In this sense, he can be said to be a successor to Edward the Confessor. His "Ironsides" were strictly disciplined and committed no offenses. After their disbandment, not one of them joined the ranks of vagrants and bandits. Even their enemy, the Royalists, said:</p>
<p>"They were also successful in peaceful work. Whether baker, mason, or cart driver, if he was engaged in solid labor, it would probably be correct to assume that he was a veteran of Cromwell."</p>
<p>Religion, in the eyes of the Anglo-Saxons, is a life-extending elixir; it has always risen and fallen with the times. From the mid-18th century to the late 18th century, John Wesley initiated a religious revival movement, separating from the Church of England and founding the Methodist Church. Secondly, in the mid-19th century, Oxford University, led by John Henry Newman and his colleagues, launched the Oxford Movement. Although that movement did not achieve its full effect because it either turned to Roman Catholicism or returned to the Church of England, it can be regarded as a major alarm clock shattering the complacency of the religious world. Afterwards, there was William Booth's Salvation Army. The Salvation Army arose from the Methodist Church, just as the Methodist Church arose from the Church of England. However, Booth and Wesley were opposites in terms of education, taste, and character. Booth was fervent and popular.</p>
<p>Gladstone, like Cromwell, was called the worst of hypocrites by the opposition party, but he was not a person who abused the power of the strong for personal gain through politics. This is recognized by anyone. The so-called "even a thief has three points of reason." Although piracy was the reality of England, it still paid lip service to benevolence and morality. Even Gladstone's political enemy, the Marquess of Salisbury, offered his eulogy to his coffin as "a great Christian statesman."</p>
<p>But what about England after that? Which English politician deserves the title of "Christian statesman"? After Gladstone's death at the end of the 19th century, the style of politicians deteriorated. Even the empty rhetoric of Christians vanished entirely. As for the Churchill generation now, they can only be described as shameless descendants of pirates, and no other praise can be added.</p>
<p>Did the English abandon religion, or did religion abandon the English? No matter which, the English have fully and unreservedly displayed their pirate nature of not fearing God, not respecting heaven, and believing in materialism. How can this not consume the nation's vitality and accelerate its self-destruction! (Translated by Ding from the Mainichi Shimbun, April 30)</p>

<h3>Household Flour to Be Sold Soon - Price per Pound Awaits Announcement - Sale of Third Phase of Sugar May Be Postponed</h3>
<p>Sources in the rice industry have learned that the 35th phase of household flour in the two concessions is preparing to resume sales soon. At that time, the 35th phase flour purchase certificate will be used to grant purchases. It is reported that each person can purchase one market pound. The price per pound is awaiting formal announcement by the two authorities. The purchase method is the same as in the past. Rice stores can receive sales slips today, with each bag priced at 207.80 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, compared to 100.08 yuan per bag previously.</p>
<p>Transporting Glutinous Rice Requires a Passport</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food considers glutinous rice to be a type of rice and therefore not allowed to be transported freely. It has specifically informed the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct its subordinates to assist in inspection. Anyone transporting glutinous rice from other areas to the Shanghai area should, before transport, follow regulations and apply to the Ministry for a grain transport passport. Only after approval and issuance can the transport take place (this should also be done for transport to the Shanghai control line). When it arrives in Shanghai, each inspection agency must inspect based on the Ministry's passport. Anyone transporting without the above passport will be charged with smuggling.</p>
<p>Phase Two Sales End on the 17th</p>
<p>Since the second phase of household oil began to be sold universally with housing tax receipts on the 7th of this month, most households have already purchased it. Each person gets four ounces, sold for 5.10 yuan. It is now known that this oil sale is scheduled for ten days and will end on the 17th. Failure to collect by the deadline will be considered voluntary abandonment.</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Will Definitely Change</p>
<p>The distribution procedures for some retailers of the third phase of household sugar have not yet been completed, so the sale on the 15th may not take place as scheduled. The price of the third phase of household sugar will definitely be increased, but the amount of the increase is still under consideration by the authorities.</p>
<p>Nanshi Opens Distribution - Current Ration</p>
<p>The distribution of food rations based on population count for the 13th phase in the urban area has been completed by the Municipal Food Bureau. It has instructed the public rice distribution centers in the urban area to pay and release rice. Nanshi has already started universal distribution yesterday. Each person, regardless of age, can still purchase two *sheng* of rice, and the price is still six yuan. Other districts will also begin sales soon.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin Arrives in Shanghai Last Night - Convening the China Electric Meeting</h3>
<p>Minister of Propaganda Lin arrived in Shanghai at 9:20 PM last night by express train. Representatives from various circles went to welcome him, including the head of the Shanghai office of the Propaganda Department, Feng Jie; the secretary-general of the Education Association, Zhou Huariren; the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Ye Xuesong; the acting president of the China Daily, Xu Liqiu; the president of the Central News Agency, Zhao Muru, as well as personnel from various subordinate agencies of the Propaganda Department. After Minister Lin got off the train, he exchanged pleasantries with the welcoming personnel and then drove back to his official residence to rest. It is reported that Minister Lin will personally preside over the opening ceremony of the company's new film today in his capacity as chairman of the board of directors of the China Film United Corporation and convene the company's shareholders' meeting.</p>
<h3>Travelers to Other Places Must Have an Epidemic Prevention Certificate</h3>
<p>The China Branch Epidemic Prevention Association has responded to the epidemic prevention movement in the two concessions and launched tiger epidemic prevention injections. It stipulates that from now on, travelers going to other places by train must show an epidemic prevention certificate, otherwise they must be injected at the station. It is also learned that those going to other places by boat must also show an epidemic prevention certificate.</p>
<h3>Demolishing and Selling Old Houses in the Urban Area Requires a Permit</h3>
<p>Demolishing old houses in the urban area is a prohibited practice. However, recently, due to rising prices, there are still those who demolish and sell them. The municipal authorities believe that this not only harms the appearance of the city but also easily causes incidents. Therefore, they have instructed their subordinates that if civilians want to demolish old houses in the future, they must obtain approval and a certificate from the Municipal Works Bureau and permission from the Municipal Police Bureau. No one is allowed to demolish and sell houses without authorization, and violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Occupying Houses Where the Zhabei Owner Is Absent - Rental Procedures Should Be Completed</h3>
<p>Since the Navy Rehabilitation Department and the Japanese Resident Group transferred the houses and land in Zhabei District 1 where the owners were absent, the work of the Shanghai North Office of the Housing Management Committee has been very busy. It is now heard that the office will begin an investigation and registration because of the many changes in owners in the Zhabei area, in order to maintain the rights and interests of the owners. This registration regulation was announced by the Housing Management Committee as early as last November. Anyone occupying land and houses where the owner is absent should go to the office in the district to complete the rental procedures within two months after the announcement of the regulations. Otherwise, once discovered by investigation, they may be fined up to ten months of land rent or house rent, and 50% of the rent collected retroactively may be used as a reward for the informant. Therefore, those occupying land and houses where the owner is absent should quickly go to the office to complete the legal rental procedures to avoid harming themselves. The address of the office is No. 27 Fusheng Road, at the end of Hongkou Laobazi Road.</p>
<h3>Strict Inspection of Contraband on the Shanghai Suburban Blockade Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Blockade Management Office recently reported that there are often lawless elements in the Qingxiang area who privately carry weapons, ammunition, opium, heroin, and other narcotics in and out of the blockade line. Yesterday, it specifically instructed the blockade management offices in Nanhui, Fengxian, Beiqiao, Baoshan, Jiading, and Chongming to strictly inspect people entering and leaving, and not to be perfunctory.</p>
<h3>Tenth Batch of Coal Distribution - Starting to Handle Various Procedures - Distributed to the Industry in Four Grades - Deadline for Payment - Coal for Civil Use Has Also Begun to Be Shipped</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Retailers Joint Association has now begun to handle various procedures for the tenth batch of coal distribution and will distribute it to its members. It is understood that this distribution includes Datong, Liuquan Tong, and Sino-British small blocks. All members can pay the payment to Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai coal companies after receiving the notification from the Joint Association. If there is a delay, the distribution of this batch of coal will be stopped, and the membership qualification will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Four-Level Distribution This distribution method is divided into four grades: Grade A, Datong Tong 75 tons, Liuquan Tong 25 tons, Sino-British small blocks 1.25 tons; Grade B, Datong Tong 6 tons, Liuquan Tong 1 ton, Sino-British small blocks 1.2 tons; Grade C, Datong Tong 45 tons, Liuquan Tong 75 tons, Sino-British small blocks 1.15 tons; Grade D, Datong Tong 3 tons, Liuquan Tong half a ton, Sino-British small blocks 1.1 tons. The grade of each member is clearly indicated on the notification.</p>
<p>Coal for Civil Use</p>
<p>The first batch of civil use coal for customer registration, except for restaurants, has already been distributed in full. However, other civil use customers, such as dish and rice restaurants, dyeing industries, etc., have not yet been delivered. The reason is that the Jiaozuo white coal could not be returned to the designated storage within the scheduled time last week, causing delays for the retail merchants who delivered to customers. It is now known that the Jiaozuo white coal merchants have started shipping, and retail merchants have begun to expedite the procedures. They will be able to deliver to registered users in a few days.</p>
<p>Distribution of Charcoal The charcoal joint operation has now begun to handle the fifth batch of charcoal distribution. The distribution method is divided into two grades: Grade A, 400 kg; Grade B, 300 kg. The official distribution price is 3 yuan per kg in Central Reserve Certificates. The joint operation has sent letters to all retail members, urging them to pay the payment within the deadline, calculated as 1,200 yuan per household for Grade A and 900 yuan per household for Grade B. As for the source of charcoal, it is still very smooth, and there should be no shortage in the future.</p>

<h3>A Minor Dispute Leads to Death by Injury</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoniu, a native of Shaoxing, 42 years old, operated a pickled vegetable stall at the entrance of Baoyu Lane on Caishi Street and lived at No. 220 Kulun Road in Zhabei. At around 4:00 PM on the 9th, Wang was carrying a bucket on a shoulder pole when he collided with a dilapidated cart pushed by Yang Zhifang, the owner of the public firewood shop at No. 64 Wuzhen Road, and his partner Zhang Jun, causing an argument. Yang and Zhang immediately committed assault and injured Wang's vital parts. He was sent to Baolong Hospital but died. The police station reported it to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for examination and collection. On the one hand, Wang's wife, Wang Shen, filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office against Yang and Zhang for causing death by injury, requesting legal action. On the other hand, she appealed to the fellow villagers' association and the pickled vegetable industry association for assistance. The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office summoned the defendants for interrogation yesterday and ordered them to be detained pending review. The deceased left behind a wife and three children, and the family is poor. The deceased's wife has hired a lawyer to file an incidental civil lawsuit, seeking compensation for damages to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<h3>Case of Electric Tram Ticket Seller Neglecting Duty</h3>
<p>On the 11th of this month, Dan A'er wanted to board the trailer of the Route 12 tram. Seeing that there were very few people in the carriage, the ticket seller Zhu Bajin hurriedly pulled the iron gate shut and pushed Dan A'er down with force, causing four of Dan's fingers to be crushed off. The incident was discovered by the police, who sent Zhu Bajin to the court.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department Criticizes Exaggerated Allied Propaganda</h3>
<p>The press department of the Japanese Army Headquarters in Shanghai, at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 13th), as usual, hosted a regular meeting of the Chinese press corps in the city. During the meeting, the spokesperson criticized the enemy Allied forces for their meaningless and exaggerated propaganda regarding the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill. He stated that the Allied side, taking advantage of the situation in North Africa, advocated opening a second front in Europe, which was greatly exaggerated. Furthermore, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, during a meeting with reporters, falsely claimed that by exploiting the situation in North Africa, they could not only threaten Sicily but also the Mediterranean in the future. While this may be the Allied side's hope, whether it can be achieved in reality remains doubtful. Without regaining their lost air superiority, any plans would be no different from a fool's dream and would be impossible to realize. In addition, opening a second front in Europe faces many challenges, particularly the thorny diplomatic issues in the Balkans, making it difficult to proceed. The exaggerated broadcast from London to Chongqing yesterday, in two parts, showed both triumph and disappointment. Moreover, reports from British war correspondents revealed insufficient troop deployments and morale significantly inferior to the Japanese army. In short, the repeated meetings between Roosevelt and Churchill, the previous one in Casablanca focusing on a counteroffensive in Burma, ultimately failed. This time, they may be plotting using the Pacific as a source of resources, but based on the current situation, we can predict that their efforts will again undoubtedly fail. According to yesterday's telegrams, Stalin of the Soviet Union and Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing did not participate in the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. From Stalin's and Chiang's perspective, this kind of meeting is bound to raise problems. Furthermore, Bishop Yu Pin of Chongqing stated at the U.S. diplomatic conference that the U.S. has been maintaining a defensive posture in the Pacific, failing to take the offensive, which has disappointed Chongqing. They hope the U.S. can adopt an offensive strategy. Therefore, the relationship between Chongqing and the U.S. can be seen from this Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Whether the focus of this meeting is to discuss the Pacific issue is difficult to say before the facts are revealed. However, its main purpose may be to seize Burma. Even if this is achieved, whether it can solve all the difficulties for Chongqing is a problem. Finally, the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is fiercely competing with Chongqing for command, so Chennault's return to the U.S. is a last resort to seek assistance from Washington.</p>
<h3>Second Special District Party Headquarters Requests Strict Prohibition of Opium and Gambling in the City to Align with the Promotion of the New Life Movement and Frugality</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Second Special District Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang in Shanghai, regarding the prevalence of opium and gambling in Shanghai, which harms the people, has repeatedly received reports from various district branches stating: "Since the National Government returned to the capital, Shanghai's cityscape has become more prosperous, and the population has continued to grow. As the New Life Movement is actively promoted, the citizens' lives should urgently advocate thrift, increase production, establish a model of clean government, and lay the foundation for the construction of a new China. However, opium and gambling are rampant in the urban areas of Huhang, Zhabei, like scales on a fish. Countless citizens are destroying themselves, losing their fortunes, and ruining their families. The harm is extreme. We, the branch headquarters, are shocked and cannot remain silent. We hereby request that you forward this to higher authorities and send a letter to the municipal government, ordering a strict prohibition to align with the promotion of the New Life Movement and frugality, and to eliminate harm for the citizens." Based on this, the headquarters has already forwarded it to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Combined Team Defeats Beihua Team in Beiping with a Score of 1-0</h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) The Shanghai Chinese Combined Football Team, having defeated the Dongfeng Team 3-1, fought against the North China Team at the Xianongtan Public Sports Field (on the 9th). Shanghai is the representative team of Central China, and its star players, Li Tiansheng, Sun Jinshun, and Jia Youliang, are all famous players who have attended the World Games. The North China Team is also composed of top players from Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, such as Li Fenglou, Li Chaoquan, Xu Humin, and Tan Fushun, who are all outstanding figures in the North China football scene. Therefore, over 20,000 fans came to watch. The competition was very intense, with both teams alternating between offense and defense, holding each other at bay. It wasn't until the end of the first half that Li Yichen of the Shanghai team scored a goal, creating a 1-0 lead. After the break, the North China team launched a major offensive and, with the help of the wind, had many opportunities to shoot. The Shanghai team's goal was in constant danger, but Liu Xianhan was agile and saved many dangerous shots. The North China team did score a goal, but it was disallowed due to offside. Until the end of the game, neither side made any further gains. As a result, the Shanghai team defeated the North China team 1-0. The Shanghai team went to Tianjin on the 14th. Yesterday, this newspaper broadcast the news at 7:40 PM.</p>
<p>Economic Circle: Commentary</p>
<h3>"Economic Shanghai"</h3>
<p>Mr. Takeuch Fumio, a famous Japanese economist, advocates the construction of "Economic Shanghai," believing that this issue holds the key to the economic revitalization and construction of China. His conclusion is: "The purpose of this shift in diplomacy and economy is the construction of 'Economic Shanghai,' and it should not be constructed elsewhere."</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi's intention is fair, and his arguments are insightful. Why should "Economic Shanghai" be constructed? That goes without saying. What we want to examine is how to construct "Economic Shanghai"? In his conclusion, Mr. Takeuchi points out the pessimistic view regarding the construction of "Economic Shanghai"—that Shanghai's economy has always relied on trade. Since the severed trade is not easy to restore, the question now is whether Shanghai can use its existing inventory to extend its economic life. Mr. Takeuchi's criticism of this fallacy contains a "penetrating" remark: "Knowing only that the Shanghai economy has always relied on trade, they mistakenly believe that China has no power of self-sufficiency."</p>
<p>The driving force for building "Economic Shanghai" lies in "self-sufficiency," and the necessary condition for "self-sufficiency" lies in promoting production. Before the war, Shanghai relied on trade for survival. The people's needs in clothing, food, housing, and transportation were met by foreign goods. As a result, Shanghai became a one-sided consumer, never striving for industrial production, which is regrettable. Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has lost its trade-dependent nature and has actively engaged in promoting various productions in order to achieve self-sufficiency. To give one or two of the simplest examples: regarding medicines related to people's health, the current development of Shanghai's new pharmaceutical industry is almost self-sufficient; and regarding bicycles related to daily transportation, the current manufacturing capacity of Shanghai's bicycle industry is also almost self-sufficient. From this, it can be seen that Shanghai's power of self-sufficiency is definitely not non-existent and is very strong. Some may ask: After Shanghai changes from a trading port to an industrial city, can it achieve self-sufficiency without the assistance of trade? To answer this question, it is first necessary to understand the meaning of constructing "Economic Shanghai," which is to revitalize the Chinese economy, stabilize the Chinese people's livelihood, and further achieve the economic co-prosperity of China and Japan. In that case, the exchange of materials between Shanghai and other regions of China, as well as between Shanghai and other regions of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, must become a necessary condition for constructing "Economic Shanghai." In other words, Shanghai's industrial power absolutely cannot do without the raw materials of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the economic control of the Chinese interior also absolutely cannot do without the products of the Shanghai region. Therefore, although "Economic Shanghai" does not have to worry about its self-sufficiency status due to the loss of its previous trade dependence, the trade necessary to maintain Shanghai's industrial production power—within the Co-Prosperity Sphere—must still be smoothly promoted.</p>
<h3>Financial Circles in the City Initiate Rural Banking Syndicate Organization Content</h3>
<p>Enhancing agricultural production, the first priority is to establish a rural financial system. The Bank of Communications, recognizing this, previously announced the organizational plan of the "Rural Banking Syndicate," which has attracted attention from all sides. Now, it has obtained a concrete plan for rural finance and plans to submit the plan to the National Government for implementation soon.</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications, based on the instructions of the Ministry of Industry, began investigating the actual situation in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui peaceful areas at the end of last year and urged major banks in Shanghai to join the rural financial group. It has now obtained agreement in principle from all sides. Based on the first investigation report, an agreement has been reached on concrete measures for rural lending. The specific measures have not yet been announced, but the main content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Banks: It is speculated that the Bank of Communications will be at the center, and banks such as China, Jin Cheng, and Yanye will also join. However, rural finance has lower profits than commercial finance and requires long-term low interest rates. The relevant authorities also intend to limit the financial nature to about 20 powerful banks to join the group.</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Quota: It is expected that the first phase (five years) will be set at 1 billion yuan of financing. Regarding the above financing, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank have also reached an understanding in principle.</p>
<p>Loan Methods: The main reason for the failure of rural finance in the past was that there were landlords and usurious capital between financial institutions and farmers, resulting in the benefits of rural finance being seized. This time, the following methods will be followed: (A) Not all existing cooperatives will be used, only those deemed most reputable will be used as lending targets. In rural areas without cooperatives with a solid foundation, financial cooperatives will be organized under the supervision and guidance of the banking syndicate as lending targets. (B) Supervise and guide the operation of cooperatives to ensure their suitability, prevent the existence of commercial capital, and maintain low interest rates. The interest rate will be divided into stages for farmers, farms, and agricultural enterprises, with the lowest interest rates for farmers, followed by higher rates, depending on the actual situation in each region. It is also planned to dispatch a second investigation team to various places by the end of this month to determine the location for setting up the financial group's offices.</p>
<h3>China Communications and Other Banks to Establish Rural Loan Offices</h3>
<p>China, Communications, Jiangsu, and Shanghai Fuxing banks are jointly organizing rural loans, and all work is actively underway. The "Rural Loan Office" of the four banks will also be announced this month, and then "Rural Loan Sub-Offices" will be established in various parts of the inland.</p>
<h3>Unified Registration of Banks and Pawnshops Must Be Completed by Deadline</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize finance and unify the management of financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions and their implementation rules. After the implementation, all financial institutions (such as banks, pawnshops, and trust companies) are required to apply for registration and supplementary registration in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. They are only allowed to operate after the Ministry of Finance approves and issues a business license. The Ministry of Finance's relevant financial inspection agencies have found that most of the banks and pawnshops in this city have been approved for registration and issued licenses, but no less than 50 banks and pawnshops have been operating without applying for registration. This violation of laws and regulations hinders financial promotion and has a great impact. Therefore, it is planned to consult with the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office to urge the banks and pawnshops to complete the application for registration procedures in accordance with the law by the deadline in mid-August. After the deadline, they will be strictly banned and not allowed to operate.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Considers Connecting Shanghai Suburbs Transshipment Tax Collection Points</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs is considering strengthening the connection between the transshipment tax collection points set up around Shanghai. Recently, there have been frequent cases of peddlers evading the eyes of various transshipment tax collection points and smuggling goods, especially in the Xujiahui area. In order to prevent this malpractice, in the future, whenever it is discovered that someone is traveling on a prohibited road, they will be strictly dealt with in accordance with the regulations for preventing smuggling. (May 13th, Dalu Xinbao)</p>
<h3>Amidst Re-Investigation of Hoarding, Black Market to Face Strict Suppression</h3>
<p>Recently, special commissioners have been dispatched again to thoroughly investigate hoarding, and the "Regulations for Punishing Hoarding" have been promulgated. It is rumored that a tough policy will be adopted against the black market, so the black market has slightly fallen. Although some commodity prices have stopped rising wildly, the average black market prices in January, February, March and April are still shocking. Everyone believes that the only way to suppress prices and eliminate the black market is to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation so that prices return to the levels of January.</p>
<p>Among the black markets of various commodities, only rice has shown a slight decline. This can also be regarded as a success of the national management of rice through the issuance of food warehouse bonds by the National Government. Based on this experience, it is hoped that commodity warehouse bonds will also be issued for major commodities such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth to implement national management.</p>
<p>Currently, miscellaneous grains are prospering, and their rising prices are inversely proportional to the falling price of rice. As a result, farmers will not focus on producing rice, only ensuring enough for their own use, and will shift their energy to producing miscellaneous grains and selling them on the market. Currently, all parties are considering balancing price controls. (Translated from Dalu Xinbao, May 13th)</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Assigns Section Chief Lin to Attend Spring Cocoon Research Meeting</h3>
<p>In order to determine the purchase price of spring cocoons for this year, the Ministry of Industry has specifically scheduled a cocoon price assessment meeting to be held in Beijing on the 15th of this month. It has also ordered the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the relevant officials of Suzhou-Huai, Subei, and the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing, and the China Silk Company to send representatives to attend the meeting and discuss. It is learned that after the Municipal Economic Bureau received the transfer order from the Municipal Government, it has assigned Lin Tao, the Section Chief of the Fifth Section, to go to Beijing to attend the meeting, and he will also bring several proposals.</p>
<h3>Registration of Five Major Commodities, Including Flour, Extended for Ten Days</h3>
<p>The Municipal Food Bureau was ordered to handle the registration of merchants dealing in five major commodities in the city: flour, livestock products, eggs, sugar, and edible oil. It started at the end of last month and was originally scheduled to end on the 10th of this month. However, it was found that a small number of merchants have not yet registered. In consideration of the difficulties of the merchants, it has been decided to extend the deadline for ten days, until the 20th of this month. Merchants who have not yet registered during the extended period should expedite the procedures. No further extensions will be granted.</p>
<h3>Wheat Merchants in the City Convened Yesterday to Discuss Wheat Purchasing Strategies</h3>
<p>Recently, the wheat harvest in various regions will be new. Wheat merchants in the city, in order to assist the authorities in jointly purchasing from the production areas and ensure that there is no shortage of food for the people, specifically convened all their colleagues yesterday to discuss wheat purchasing strategies. In addition to formulating an implementation plan, they also sent representatives to consult the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee to seek guidance.</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua stock market softened. Under the pressure of selling to obtain cash, and amid the general decline in commodity prices, sentiment turned downward. Department stores were the weakest, with Wing On, Sincere, and China Goods Companies seeing further small declines of three to five yuan. After falling, the New Pharmaceutical Industry was absorbed by powerful investors in the afternoon, with New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory and Sino-French Pharmacy each down five jiao. Yong An Textile Factory suddenly had eager sellers, falling ten yuan, and Mayer Silk Factory was also down four yuan. Zhabei Water and China Merchants Electric Power in the public utilities sector were the most sluggish. Although there were few buyers, sellers were also unwilling to sell cheaply. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Great China Match were flat and weak. Jiuan Industrial and New Yih Property were also soft. World Book Company in the cultural industry was relatively firm, with few sales. Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company were both flat. China Brick and Tile is about to increase its capital, and the market has seen activity.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>Talking About Patience</h3>
<p>— Zhiwu</p>
<p>"A small impatience ruins great plans." People in ancient times regarded this saying as a profound warning for their conduct in life.</p>
<p>Xiang Yu had the courage of a commoner and lacked patience in handling affairs. He obtained Han Xin but could not use him. Although he was able to win every battle, he used his strength lightly, so he ultimately ended up "committing suicide at the Wujiang River." Liu Bang was insightful and far-sighted, and he could endure in handling affairs. He could accommodate strategists such as Zhang Liang and Chen Ping, nurturing their full strength to wait for his own weakness. Therefore, he was able to seize the Central Plains and become king of the world. Success or failure in doing things depends entirely on the key of being able to endure or not endure. Therefore, Fan Li did not commit suicide due to the shame of Kuaiji, and Cao Mo did not die from the humiliation of three defeats. They ultimately avenged Goujian's feud and repaid the shame of the State of Lu. Being able to endure a moment of anger ultimately allows one to wash away centuries of humiliation. History is not lacking in such precedents.</p>
<p>Like Jizi not showing respect to his sister-in-law, Maichen being abandoned by his wife, and Han Xin having suffered the humiliation of crawling between someone's legs, a person may be humiliated by ordinary people when they are frustrated, in distress in their hometown, or when their life is struggling. But they were all able to persevere for a time and strive to create a great future. Their success lay entirely in grasping the difference between being able to endure and not being able to endure. Therefore, the kind of person who "draws their sword and rises up in battle at the sight of a common insult" is not worthy of being called courageous. A truly courageous person has the magnanimity to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens. "They are not startled when suddenly confronted, and they are not angry when insulted for no reason. This is because what they hold is very great, and their ambition is very far."</p>
<p>Mencius said: "When Heaven is about to entrust a great task to a person, it must first cause their heart to suffer, their muscles and bones to be strained, their body to be hungry, their life to be emptied, and their actions to be disrupted, so as to move their heart and endure their nature, and increase what they cannot do." The so-called "cause their heart to suffer" and "move their heart and endure their nature" are important secrets for conducting oneself in life. Therefore, a person who can chew on vegetable roots can do anything. Throughout history, great undertakings have all grown from hard work and perseverance. If Su Qin had two qing of fields to rely on in Luoyang, how could he have had the day when he was sealed with the seal of the prime minister of six states!</p>
<p>People with patience and cultivation can remain calm in the face of adversity and not be distracted by favor or disgrace. Xunzi said, "Practice enduring nature and then you can cultivate yourself," which is indeed a golden rule for conducting oneself in life for thousands of years.</p>
<h3>"Successful People"</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhong</p>
<p>Buy, buy, a chorus of buying, and then comes the price increase, price increase, rising like crazy, creating a batch of—a minority among the majority—"successful" nouveau riche.</p>
<p>Although the increase in nouveau riche further intensifies the oppression of the little people who have no "inch of gold," which means more sacrifices, the "successful people" believe that this is inevitable, simply absolute. Thus, the "successful people" laugh triumphantly.</p>
<p>Suppose there are "clueless" "fools" who "righteously" raise objections, and even bring up "benevolence," "morality," and "ill-gotten gains never prosper" kind of "sour words" as arguments. Our "successful people" will then pull out a "famous saying" that "has been the case since ancient times"—"One general's success is built upon ten thousand corpses"—to shut your mouth.</p>
<p>Really, "fool!" Our "successful people" can further explain to you, "The market" and "the battlefield" are not the same "principle"? Who told you that you have no "inch of gold?" Otherwise, wouldn't you have the hope of being "one general's success?"</p>
<p>If "one general's success" requires "ten thousand corpses," then a nouveau riche's "success" requires "ten thousand starving."</p>
<p>So, friend, what else do you want to say, except to wait to become a starving corpse? (Payment to Charity for School Funding)</p>
<h3>After Viewing "Eternal Fame"</h3>
<p>— Zheng Rong</p>
<p>The long-promoted "Eternal Fame" has finally been screened before moviegoers. This is a historical record of the "Opium War," a bloody fact that provides people with an indelible lesson. The end of the Opium War resulted in the signing of the first humiliating Treaty of Nanjing, and the scourge of opium has not yet been eradicated to this day. It is truly regrettable! Infinitely hateful! The screening of this historical fact will shake the heartstrings of millions upon millions of compatriots, causing them to roar in anger. At a time when East Asian nations are rising up and extricating themselves, I feel that everyone should see it.</p>
<p>The scriptwriting of "Eternal Fame" is very moving. The power of the dialogue and the severity of the satire are heartbreaking and can be deeply etched on everyone's mind. The unreasonable behavior of the British at the time, their numerous tricks, and their various violent actions are hateful to the core and make one's hair stand on end. When Commissioner Lin Zexu was appointed as the imperial envoy to specifically prohibit the import of opium and confronted the British, investigating and handling private smuggling, the British schemes suffered a major blow. And Zhang Jingxian manufactured opium abstinence pills to universally save people, and established the "Anti-British Corps" banner to support the imperial court, all of which were enough to inspire excitement in several scenes.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Gao Zhanfei's Lin Zexu is the most powerful, calm and steady, with a solemn attitude, portraying the character vividly and in great detail, deserving of sincere respect. Wang Yin's Pan Danian, previously addicted to opium and unwilling to make progress, later awakened, quit his bad habits, and served the country, being heroic, handsome, and full of vitality, still retaining his tough style. Li Xianglan's Feng Gu is pitiable and lively, making people feel pity and love for her, and the two songs are melodious and beautiful. Chen Yunshang's Zhang Jingxian performed with the posture of a female hero, her heroic spirit overflowing from her eyebrows, also inspiring people. Yuan Meiyun's Zheng Yuping is good at portraying emotions, as if weeping and complaining, moving the hearts of the audience. Yan Jun's Yeli A'tuomengna's Marianna has a sinister and cunning expression, which is quite fitting. Other actors also have special performances.</p>
<h3>The Three Heads Doctrine</h3>
<p>— Yin Zi</p>
<p>Living in today's society, everyone needs some principles for living and dealing with the world, so as not to suffer losses everywhere. Summarizing the many people in today's society whose value has increased tenfold, they mostly fall into the following three heads: First, backing; second, gimmick; third, fist. Having a strong backing truly allows one to take advantage everywhere. The position is comfortable, the work is easy, one doesn't miss out on taking advantage, and there is no major risk of doing things wrong. People are both respectful and humble, and no one can surpass the strength of their momentum.</p>
<p>Speaking of gimmicks, this is a skill of the mouth. If one can use it flexibly, one can indeed be resourceful. Although one's own skills and knowledge may be limited, with a mouth that can make flowers fall from the sky, dead things can come alive, and everything can be turned around!</p>
<p>If one doesn't have either of these, then one must use a coarse fist. If one doesn't agree with a word, roll up one's sleeves, and shout loudly, "I agree to this fist, but I don't agree to this hair," This is enough to scare the other party, knowing that one is not easy to mess with. A clever person doesn't suffer immediate losses, and immediately changes course, and from then on, one must look at you with new eyes!</p>
<p>If one is born without a backing, has an honest heart, has no gimmicks, is physically weak, and is as docile as a lamb, then one will naturally be unknown and suffer losses everywhere!</p>
<h3>Random Words</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>The bad social environment is not worth resenting, because this is a necessary process of life. As the saying goes, "He who eats bitterness upon bitterness becomes a man above men." Abundant results are originally hidden in the thickets of thorns.</p>
<p>A flintstone will never produce sparks without friction. Similarly, if people do not receive major stimulation, the flame of life will never burn!</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Wudalianchi</h3>
<p>— Kato Mio</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The scenic Wudalianchi in northern Manchuria is a large pond blocked by fourteen arranged volcanic cones. Rarely visited, this article is a real-life depiction of the volcanic area.</p>
<p>The author participated as a member of the Kwantung Army reporting team from mid-January to early February. During this time, I was trained in the extremely cold region of northern Manchuria, and got the chance to actually inspect many things in northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>Manchuria and the Soviet Union are only separated by the Heilongjiang River. The life of the soldiers on the Manchurian-Soviet border during the extreme cold period of forty degrees below zero is something that not only their parents, brothers, and sisters, but also the entire population, are eager to understand. The sky is as heavy as lead, and the earth is covered with powdered and jade-carved crystalline snow. Walking with a rustling sound on the black soil that has been melted by the footprints of previous people, walking, walking, what the eyes can see is a vast, ice-covered plain, and in that plain lies a barrack as if forgotten by people. How do the soldiers live there? Having become accustomed to the neat and prosperous buildings of my own country, the first sight of the desolate scene here aroused the feeling of sympathy in my chest. Stepping into the barracks, these fearful thoughts disappeared immediately. Soldiers full of vitality ran up and greedily looked at us with eyes longing for the motherland.</p>
<p>"The spirit of the mainland is probably still very strong!"</p>
<p>Although the soldiers are in a remote border area, they still miss the present state of the motherland with deep longing. The comrades in the South maintain the progress of the South, and the unity of the people consolidates the rear of the front line. The soldiers here hold fast to the northern border. Training themselves and never slacking off in cold resistance training, cultivating fighting spirit, is how the soldiers here repay the people in the rear (The northern soldiers often practice running alone like athletes, constantly exercising their physique. Therefore, when an enemy appears, everyone has the absolute confidence and strength to win. In the icy and snowy natural environment, they constantly fight against the demon of cold and overcome it. In the eyes of these young soldiers, this is like a spiritual struggle, a white-blade encounter with the enemy.</p>
<p>The soldiers try their best to find entertainment to comfort themselves, such as planting flowers, raising birds, and organizing theater and music groups. The northern soldiers cannot but endure this kind of tempering under the fierce power and environment of nature. The people in the rear can only step up the activities in the rear and unite with the front line, which is enough to repay the hard work of the soldiers in the northern border by one ten-thousandth. After returning from the inspection, the author respectfully presents his gratitude to the soldiers in the northern border.</p>
<p>The author would like to report a little on the cold-resistant weapons of the Northern Manchurian army and the scientific research of the soldiers. Although the details are not very clear and there is no freedom to publish them, I would still like to present to the readers a visit to the "Winter's Wudalianchi and Arranged Volcanoes" in the Northern Manchurian mountainous area.</p>
<p>"Are there earthquakes in Northern Manchuria?" How many people can answer that question with certainty? However, according to records, Northern Manchuria is by no means a land without earthquakes.</p>
<p>The survey report of Dalian University of Technology</p>
<p>states: "The Manchurian volcanoes are clustered in two places. In southern Manchuria, from Longgang through Yitong to Zhengjiatun, there are twenty volcanoes within three hundred li east and west. In the northern Manchurian region, with Mo'ergen in northern Manchuria Province as the center, there are forty volcanoes within a range of fifty li. The remaining seventy or so dormant volcanoes are in Changbai Mountain and Wudalianchi. In addition, all are extinct volcanoes."</p>
<p>Our group, including members of the reporting team, the press team (news, magazines, writers), the art team, the photography team, and the internship team (national school instructors), many people, carrying cold-proof gear, short swords at our waists, led by several guards, eagerly began to advance to the site. Thanks to the kindness of the Bei'an Provincial Office, the team members were able to ride in long-distance buses, following behind the army's transport vehicles. On a bulletin board in front of the guard post of a certain unit, the current temperature was indicated as thirty-two degrees below zero. Walking, walking on the vast northern Manchurian plain, all we could see around us was an endless horizon. Although we were in the car, wearing scarves and cold-proof hats, our nose hairs were freezing, and our beards were forming white frost pillars. It was such a vast place that we didn't see a village for dozens of miles. Our fingers and toes were all numb with cold. After the car had been running for nine hours, we got out of the car to warm up and walked behind the car, and then got back in the car when we were a little warmer. Passing through the city of Dedu County, and going about twenty kilometers further north along the Bono Mur River (transliteration), we saw a hill shaped like an upturned alms bowl. This is the starting point of the "Wudalianchi Arranged Volcanoes" we wanted to explore. Wudalianchi is located in Dedu County (126 degrees 7 minutes east longitude, 48 degrees 43 minutes north latitude). The original name was Wuyun He'ergeji Volcano. In the fifty-ninth year of Kangxi, two of these fourteen volcanoes, Huoshaoshan and Laoheishan, erupted violently, and the lava flowed to the lowlands, forming a large pond. Seven days after the eruption, the lava solidified.</p>
<p>This is what the residents have associated with many legends (one says that the black dragon and the golden dragon fought) and call it Shilon Lava. The fourteen mountains are not large in area, each with its own crater. The area of ​​Shilon Lava is 3.7 times that of Sakurajima in Kyushu, Japan, and its volume is 0.7 times that of Sakurajima. The rock quality is Mesozoic and basalt, and below it is pitch-black or blue-black olivine, and dense and porous vitreous rock. Its color and shape become a special background for Wudalianchi, just like a dragon drinking water, so this place is called Shilon Lava Flow. In order to see the lava flow and Wudalianchi clearly, we rustled through the powder snow and climbed Yaquan Mountain. The elevation of this mountain is only 358 meters. The bare mountain has no grass, and you can't see anything around. You can clearly and freely view the distant view of the arranged volcanic cones. The north wind blowing over the top of the mountain was like sharp needles, directly piercing through our cold-proof gear. We looked at the fourteen volcanic cones and bowed our heads in the mystery of this great nature.</p>
<p>Yaquan Mountain is not only a suitable place for viewing, but at the bottom of the crater of this mountain, there is also a building (Qiling Temple), which is famous for its five grotesque idols. In order to commemorate the history of ethnic struggles, that is, the rise and fall of the Han and Mongolian peoples, this place is regarded as a sacred place. This is hard to believe. However, in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, a so-called old monk built a spiritual temple at the foot of this mountain, as a subordinate temple of Falun Temple in Baiquan County, Bei'an Province. It took another eleven years to place 146 bronze Buddha statues of the same size as real people, as well as 61 child statues, in the Zhonglingguan in Baiquan County, enshrining ancient and modern saints, sages, loyal ministers, and filial sons, and built temples to make Wudalianchi sacred. Among the enshrined Buddha statues are Sakyamuni, Christ, Confucius, Abbe, Maria, Aristotle, and the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, but there are no Japanese sages, which is quite noteworthy. In the grassland area connecting Yaquan Mountain and the lava area, 1,200 meters east and west, there are carbonic acid springs everywhere. In the spring, Mongolians from far away carry their families in large carts to this place, and fast and bathe in this spring, and scoop the spring with shell spoons and drink it. It is said that the cold spring has miraculous effects on stomach and intestinal diseases, and it is a spiritual spring for washing away the filth of body and mind.

<h3>Providing Free Medical Consultation and Medicine</h3>
