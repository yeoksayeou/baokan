<p>社評</p>
<h3>穩定市場與增加生產</h3>
<p>物價問題的嚴重性，至今未見澈底消除，不僅本市一般人仍苦於物價之飛　上漲，漫無止境，即其他各地物價的波動情形，也有不容忽視者。所以平抑物價，穩定市場，仍是當務之急，否則人心忐忑，社會不安，對於戰時國策的推行，實在是一大障礙，當局嚴厲實施限價之應該擁護者在此。但是要使限價發生實際上的效果，就不僅在限價本身的方案與技術上要佈置得周密適當，如我們前週所詳指陳的，而且更重要的，還必須爲限價奠定鞏固的基石：一塊是穩定幣値，一塊是增加生產。其他如解決游資問題。嚴禁囤積居奇等等，當然也不能忽視。但就治本辦法言：穩定幣值與增加生產二者，實比其他更爲重要。我們要明白，物價上漲的最基本的主導因素，是幣傎的下跌，據專家的估計，過去物價高漲因素中，屬於物資方面者僅佔三分之一，屬於通貨方面者將佔三分之二。因此要緩和物價之飛漲，必須首先着眼於「穩定幣値」。前者日本靑木大臣等之表示維持中國新幣決心，正是有鑒於此的重要對策，我們盼望當局以更大的決心以穩定的幣值，不僅是奠定限價政策成功的基石，而且也是促進中國戰時經濟正常發展的前提，否則，一切其他方面的努力，至少會是「事倍功半」的了。</p>
<p>但是，同時也不能低估物資因素的重要性，物資之缺乏的現象，是在逐漸明顯化了。有人說，物價暴漲不是物資缺乏，因爲各地握在囤戶手中的貨品很多，貨品存底旣多，自難稱之爲物資缺乏。其實，這是近視的看法，要知道目前戰爭的需要，並不是一朝一夕的，囤戶搜集的存底雖然不少，但究屬有限，而且除了某些軍用品和特殊器材以外，一般日用品主要還靠各地生產來供應的。何况由於戰時運輸的因難，物資的來源是更單純和短少了。各方之需要無窮，而存底的物資有限，因此握有這些貨物的人，便視爲奇貨可居，雖有峻法厲刑而有所不懼者矣。如果我們的生產能够大量的解決各方需要，則囤積者亦即不能居奇了。最近各方要求增加生產之呼聲，其原因即在此；否則，一切限價與統制便落空了。</p>
<p>可是談到生產事業，我們不能不指出，目前還存在着許多不利於生產發展的因素。首先在生產事業經營者本身方面，有着種種缺點，例是經營目標的錯誤，工作的不够緊張，資金籌劃的困難，主持人員之不盡合於理想，以至於各業各部門間之不能互相配合，都是不能掩飾的事實。要使我國生產事業能够發展下去，能供應更大的產量，這些缺點，顯然是必須克服的。爲了克服這些缺點，自然又必須改善勞資關係，提高工作效率，充分利用生產設備。一方面有賴於生產事業各主持者之具有國家民族思想，與政治上的遠大的眼光，和領導的能力；另方面更在政府當局之周詳的計劃與熱心的扶植，尤其是對民營企業負責調劑，供應短期流動資金，或貸放長期款項等。我們認爲政府與民間之密切合作，才能眞正收獲生產理想的效果。</p>
<p>在政府與民間協力增進生產的實際行動中，有一個重要的問題必須解決，就是「計劃生產」問題。我們要特別鄭重的指出，中國今天還未有實行嚴密完備的計劃生產的社會條件，在客觀上只是一個小商品生產佔優勢的國家，在主觀上，公家的資金器材的供給，還是十分有限的。而那些障碍與計劃生產的社會因素，更是不一而足，要實行計劃生產，就必須首先廓淸那些障碍的社會因素。這就牽涉太大，自不可期之於短期間內，那麽，在「補苴罅漏」的情形之下而談計劃生產，則結果不免走上官辦統制的道路。而自滿淸季世以來官辦事業的事實敎訓我們，重慶官辦統制的事實敎訓我們，延宕敷衍的作風，不知影響了若干生產事業，而那種微妙的人事關係，更不知加重產業界以多少重負。至於一面停止私人企業，一面又開辦同樣的國營企業的現象，其浪費之處，更不必說了。不問國家情形而徒知抄襲他國的辦法，結果決非國家民族之福。但我們也反對無條件的放任政策，而必須在擴展生產上，衡量緩急，比較輕重，我們始終認爲政府的任務，仍在於領導資助，而不在於干涉限制，更不在於超越現有條件去經營一些人民可以經營的事業。有以爲政府如不掌握大量物資，便無法平抑物價，其實這是片面的看法，只要政府能動員民衆，依靠民衆，切實裁制囤積居奇。適當的措理游資問題和穩定幣値，　增加生產的物資，縱不完全屬於國營事業，縱然未完全被政府所掌握，但市塲上的供給量顯然是會增加的。市塲的供給增加，則平抑物價不是更有效果了嗎？反之，如果不努力於獎勵私人企業之生產，則在某一時期，用某些辦法，縱可掌握一些物資，但不會繼續大量的供給下去，平抑物價不是更困難了嗎？</p>
<p>總之，穩定幣傎增加生產，乃是限價政策　至整個物價政策的根本辦法；而增加生產更必須政府與民間密切的合作。物價平抑，市塲穩定，然後民生可以改善，而一切戰時國策乃可期其貫澈。</p>

<h3>緬甸新作戰的意義</h3>
<p>日本派遺軍目睹敵方又有企圖奪回緬甸的蠢動，立即調集陸空兩路的精銳開始新作戰。</p>
<p>這次作戰的結果，不但是擊滅敵軍，確保緬甸的治安，而且有極好的影響給予印度民衆，這一點是更值得注目的。自從聖雄甘地絕食之後，印度的反英運動愈趨白熟化，所以英印軍想把緬甸克服，藉此來緩和印度的反英空氣，或抑制其反英運動，可是他的計劃並沒有成功，依然失敗，反而促進了印度民衆的反英決心，不久當有事實來證明它的失策。</p>
<p>但是我們不能輕視敵方的企圖。英印軍總司令華維爾曾經幾次聲明：「緬甸是戰略上最重要點之一，又爲要和重慶取得聯絡起見，也非要把緬甸收復不可，我時常在研究收復緬甸的作戰辦法。」羅斯福也以爲南洋的反攻旣不能如願，還是加强中國大陸的根據地來空襲日本本土，最爲上策，可是現在援蔣不能充分，始終沒有辦法可以達到目的。唯有收復緬甸重闢援蔣路綫，捨此以外，沒有其他方途。渝方軍政部長何應欽的訪問印度，和敵方要人的往來頻繁，這是事實吿訴我們敵方爲這件事正在分頭商量，所以我們要知道今後敵方必然還要發動奪回緬甸作戰，更進一步的加强力量來襲。</p>
<p>綜觀大東亞戰爭的現狀，自從喀達爾加納爾島的戰略上成功以來，東亞共榮國的外圍屛障，已經鞏固堅定，握有發動攻勢的主宰地位，努力來完成且戰且進的建設大業。尤以緬甸的建設，更有顯著成就，東條首相在議會上發表的聲明中也說過，緬甸的獨立，大概在本年度可以實現。敵方對此如何焦躁不安，我們是瞭如指掌，他們一定不肯等待緬甸的獨立成功，就要來反攻緬甸，不但是這一方，恐怕其他各方面也要發動反攻的。我們除了感謝日軍保衛前綫擊滅敵人反攻的勞苦外，同時要記住不但是緬甸的建設，任何各地的建設都是在大敵當前，火藥氣味中築起來的。（雲鵬譯自三月一日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>在中國有句很普的話叫做「非是你不成」，換句日本話來說，就是「不是你不行」。這句語是請託對方面含有謙遜的意思。可是除了謙遜之外，還有一點拜託人家的意思。這句話眞配稱「語簡言深」。在中日兩國國交上，就是將來中日兩國人士的交　上，也需要彼此存着非是你不可，非你不成的心理。</p>
<p>如果說中日兩國是兄弟之邦，那末弟敬兄，兄愛弟的敬愛和謙遜，也是少不了的。</p>
<p>中日兩國，正在步上相偕苦樂的大道，彼此之間，不但要口頭上用「非是你不成」這句話，必須要刻骨銘心來牢記這句話。使用這句話的機會越多，雙方的關係越密。祗要誠心誠意，今後中日之間隨便發生什麼問題，都會在談笑之中解決的。無論遭遇怎樣的難關，我相信也容易發見解決途徑的。</p>
<p>因撤廢治外法權，交還租界而生的種種問題和難事，也祗要中日雙方精神結合，大家抱着「非是你不成」的心理，確信它一定可以很順利的解決應付過去。</p>
<p>上次在南京要人招待的茶話會上，我在席間也引用了「非你不可」的一句話，把中日兩國應該相輔相携的道理向到會的諸公講述，承他們都用同情贊許的容顏來聽我的說話，我雖然不善操用流利的華語，可是也覺得非常欣快。</p>
<p>趁中國參戰的機會，日本的對華方針，有着飛躍進展，把預定的方針，一件一件來付諸實踐，中國也響應日本的方針，而轉換對日方針，到達了中日向同一方向進行的時機，在這樣一個嚴重局面之下，中國的大衆，是否有淸晰的理解和堅定的信心，假使單定日本人這樣想，中國人不能給予協助，那麽眞正的提携是無法得到的。我倒還是担心這一點。「非是你不成」是句中國話，中國旣已有了這句話，就要來運用這句話才是啊。在中國人們裏頭，固不乏憂　之士，可是總平均起來，似乎還欠國家觀念，爲個人利害得失打算的人倒有不少。雖然不能說沒有捨私爲國的團結心，可是這種團結心總覺得還嫌薄弱。所以現在中國人必須要抱定「非是你不成」和「非你不可」的精神，和日本方面協力來確立大東亞共榮圈。大衆的對日敎育重心，也在這裏，同時我日僑也應該玩味這句中國話的意思，不吝推誠協助復興中國，（雲鵬；譯自三月九日大陸新報栗本寅治原著）</p>

<h3>突尼西亞　南部曾有劇戰　德軍佔領若干陣地　準備再度進攻英軍</h3>
<p>瑞士京城八日哈瓦斯社電　突尼西亞前綫、昨日無大事足述、北路賽基那區、軸心軍稍有進展、但戰事限於空軍活動、中路則僅有斥堠活動、南路馬萊斯陣綫曾有劇戰、協約軍方面承認德軍於劇戰後佔領梅丹茂區（梅迪寗以西）若干陣地、英軍曾以排砲猛轟、圖阻德軍進迫、但羅美爾軍仍將英軍陣綫衝破、梅迪寗以北及西北一帶之高地、亦有激戰、另據阿爾及耳港無綫電廣播稱、羅美爾上將現調集坦克車隊及步兵於馬萊斯附近、殆將再度大舉向英軍總攻、馬萊斯陣綫以西、多澤爾附近及傑里德沙特河北岸、軸心軍與美軍亦有接觸、此外、軸心國空軍亦極活躍、昨日共擊落英機二十一架、內中十二架係被義機擊落、又德機轟炸特里波里港時、曾擊壞港內停泊之船隻二艘、</p>

<h3>日本重要產業概况（三）</h3>
<p>石炭工業</p>
<p>石炭，是各種產業交通部門的熱力和動力的泉源，不僅是不可缺的基礎資源，而且爲構成化學工業的原料，故極爲重要。在兵站物資的需要上，其次在化學工業，及其他鐵道，電氣，瓦斯，焦炭等生產擴充第一線的事業中，石炭佔重工業的第一位。石炭的增產及其順利的配給，爲目前最切要的急務，自中國事變以來，其需要有顯著的增加　。</p>
<p>因戰時石炭需要的激增，生產方面，亦有急劇的增加，昭和十一年度的產額的數爲四·七九〇萬公斤（本國四，一八），朝鮮二二八，樺太二〇八，台灣一七四）。如滿洲，華北，近年來產額的增加亦很急速。石炭的埋藏量在東亞共榮圈內各地很爲豐富，其主要者在日本本國為九州地方，至筑豐，三池，唐津各地的炭田品質那很優良，　多是粘結性石炭，和　部的炭田合計起來，約占本國出炭量的〇〇％。其次，北海道將來亦很有希望，炭質亦佳。石狩的炭田最大，福島縣平市地方的常磐炭田的炭質多爲褐炭類，因爲接近消費地帶，故從運輸的關係上看來，頗値得重視。滿洲國昭和十一年度的出炭量爲一，二〇〇高公斤，這數字比較起來在近年可見有非常急劇的增加。主要炭礦有滿鐵系的撫順，烟台，瓦房店，蚊河，老頭溝等；滿洲炭礦系的阜新，北票，西安，鶴岡，密由等；其他系有本溪湖，不邊道等，華北為世界最大的石炭資源地，炭質也極優良。主要炭礦有最近業經解除軍管理的中興，磁縣，大汶口，陽泉，和井涇，大同，開澳等。至於其他地方，可得而舉者，如華中的淮南煤礦，在越南則有質佳的鴻基煤田，柬埔寨，古爾貝的無烟煤田等。在目前決戰時期中，因船舶運輸的關係，故祗能特別注重於本國的九州煤，山口煤，常磐煤，北海道煤則用作原料用炭，發生爐用炭。</p>
<p>本國煤礦會社之主要者，在九洲，山口等主業地帶的會社有三井礦山，三菱礦業一大會社，其次有貝島煤礦，明治鑛產，住友鑛業，日鐵鑛業，日產化學工業，古河鑛業，字部興產，麻生鑛業，東邦煤礦，東見初煤鑛，杵島煤鑛，大正鑛業，嘉穗鑛業部。在北海道，常磐等地則有三井，三菱，及北海道煤鑛三大會社，其次有雄別煤鑛，太平洋煤鑛，磐城煤鑛，昭和電工，大日本炭鑛等。</p>
<p>以上二十二社爲石炭統制會的單獨會員，此外另有許多中小炭礦業者，全國分爲七個石炭統制組合，九州最多。這些大小煤鑛會社的營業成績，因工資，資材，營業費等的增加，故生產費增高，以昭和十三年下半期爲準，則其後漸有低下的傾向，十七年度的實際情形，盈餘的固有，虧空者亦不少。大概其每噸的採算價格一時比較起來，有幾分惡化的傾向。</p>
<p>爲使低物價政策得以順利進行，故自昭和十三年抑低煤價，政府並採取收貿價格補償金制度，以彌補上述採算價格惡化的傾向。</p>
<p>煤的買賣，現集中於日本石炭會社，當向採鑛業者收買煤的時候，補償各採鑛者因增進其生產所必要的生產費與適當的利潤。參酌其品質與事業能率而決定其價格：他方，當把這收買的煤賣出的時候，把收買價格，運輸費及其他等等加以綜合的計算，依照其品質而設定合理的適當的價格。避免把收買時所增加的價値轉嫁於需要者，該會社因此而生的損失，由政府的收買價格補償金來補償。</p>
<p>這一項經費，在昭和十五年度，放出二千〇六十三萬餘圓，其後因生產費的繼趨高漲，故年有增加，至十八年度，爲保障煤鑛業者的適當利潤，故預計將達三億一千六百九十萬餘圓之鉅。</p>
<p>石炭事業的決戰體制，在商工省燃料局石炭部指導之下，以石炭統制會爲中心而展開。統轄全國的煤鑛業者，與政府成爲一體，其責任至爲重大。其會長爲前明治產業社長松本健次郞氏，因欲與石炭配給部門發生密切的聯絡，並兼任日本石炭會社社長。理事長爲原企劃院次長植村甲午郎氏，並由大炭鑛會社出身的富有知識經騐者任理事及事務局的部長課長。石炭的生產擴充計劃，需給計劃，及與外地外國各統制機關的聯絡調査，或企業的整理統合計劃等廣泛的事業，分別由生產，勞務，資材，配給，監理等各部進行。</p>
<p>當生產計劃設定而實施時，把握各會社的實體，而決定每一會社所應生產的比例量。各會社對其被指定的生產量負有義務，以便生產統制徹底化。至於勞務對策，則由勞務部與厚生省所實施的勞務動員計劃相合作，將勞働者分爲一般壯年，半島勞働者，及勤勞報國隊三種，視其生產能率，而適當地分配於各煤礦。又煤礦資材勞務者的食糧及生活必需品，計有百七·八十種之多，都由資材部實施一元的統制，以期能確保其分配。</p>
<p>關於煤的配給，日本石炭會社的配給部長新居幸一氏兼任統制會的配給部長，設定配給計劃，指導統制煤的運輸裝卸。在日本石炭會社的一元統制之下，指定經紀團體及零售團體，實施共同購入，共同販賣。</p>
<p>由於官民一致的協力，克服勞力資材的不足、生產費增高的惡條件，產生極良好的成績。同時，加緊生產，突破目標額，在目前決戰情勢中，謀石炭生產的增强。煤礦區的整理統合，亦爲現實的問題之一。在有限的資材，勞務資金等生產要素與船舶運輸的關係之下，攻府頒布了戰時行政職權特例，戰時行政特例法等，糾正了原有的官廳割據主義，打開生產增强的隘路，更從地域的，炭質的，以及煤礦經營的能率等見地，全面的實施生產集中。</p>
<p>煤礦的整理統合，已成爲長時期的懸案。因與各會社有利害的關係，故今日尙無打開僵局的跡象。石炭統制會企劃部，創立以來，關於各煤礦及錯綜礦區的整理統合問題，正進調査計劃劃中，爲適應目前的情勢，在十八年後，政府將實施各煤礦的統合，及給予整理的補助金。各大煤礦會社的合理的統合，固成問題，然而最大的問題還是在於七百餘中小煤礦會社的如何整理統合。</p>
<p>煤礦之整理統合，在本屆議會上，岸商相及政府委員已屢加說明。對於生產能率良好而有希望的煤礦，在有限的資材勞力下，努力增强其生產，以各煤礦之合理的生產集中爲目的。當整理的時候，除視其能率的優秀性，煤坑的將來性之外，原料用炭，瓦斯用炭等特殊炭與一般炭更爲重視。又在船舶的運輸問題上，離消費地較遠的煤坑先於較近的煤坑加以整理。以上各項問題之如何敏速順利的解決，爲今後日本石炭增產的關鍵，也是日本增强戰力的關鍵。（翔：譯自三月三日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>夜間轟炸瓜達爾加那爾島　月光之下炸彈如雨　敵高射砲徒然咆哮</h3>
<p>（OO根據地高原海軍報道班員電）是夜，瓜達爾加那爾島的一半爲雲所蔽，在暗淡的月光之下，横躺着反映微光的隆格河。——〇月〇〇日日本海軍航空部隊，自日沒至翌〇〇日日出以前，分爲〇次，接連向瓜達爾加那爾島猛炸，敵空軍牙城，徹宵炸彈如雨而下，把共設施，痛加摧毀，使敵的心膽，爲之寒裂。而且此次夜襲，竟克服了長距離夜間飛行的困難，又且是挺身於敵方熾烈的防禦砲火和對空照射之中所行的果敢的攻擊。記者此次附乘OO少尉所率的攻擊隊，得有機會目擊其果敢的夜間攻擊。</p>
<p>攻擊機向島影進入</p>
<p>「喂！仔仔細細去看一番來吧！」OO長這樣地激勵我，我一面以笑容回答他，一面便成爲機上的人了。年輕的機員們，親切地拿出飛行衣來送給我道：「夜裏是很冷的…。」在赤道附近的地方，穿着毛織的汗衫，已經很熱，還要加上飛行衣，身體完全像進人了蒸汽浴室裏一樣，熱得渾身汗涔涔了。可是出了根據地以後，一同兒到了雲間眺月的時候，炎熱便不知被吹到那裏去了，身上已覺得很冷。飛到了高度〇〇公尺，攻擊機巧妙地避開了前面的雲塊，在沙羅門海上滑溜地進行。偶然向下一望，在白色的雲間，可以看見映着金色光彩的海面。那海面之上，處處有淸淸楚楚的黑影散在着，我以爲那些黑影大概都是島影吧，因此一心一意地看着，誰知那些都是月光所映的雲影哩。機的右側有黑暗的雲塊重疊而在，使天空呈着險惡的形狀。空中時時有電閃放射出來。</p>
<p>「天候是夜間飛行的敵」，這話一瞬間便掠過了我的腦海，現在左側出現了一個大雲峰，兀然突立，其浴着光的表面，呈着乳白之色，反面則呈暗灰色。從這個雲峰的頂上俯瞰，下面反映着水光的海，宛如湖面一樣的靜在着。月光照入駕駛座來，靑白色地照出駕駛員的半身。其前面的計器板上，浮現出許多的數字以及指針的燐光。後方的電報員靠着微弱的光，拚命地按着電鍵，而在電報機的上面，却掛着日本貨和外國貨的兩種偶形，那大槪是慰問袋贈來的吉人（Mascot）吧。從電報座這邊有小紙片轉到OO少尉那邊去，那是〇次轟炸隊過來的電報，是報吿敵地上空的氣象適於轟炸的。</p>
<p>飛機愈益順利地通過了OO島的〇側，寒冷愈來愈厲害，手已經要凍僵了，只得插入袋裏，暫時忍耐着，機員却從後面來拍我的肩膀，借給我一付皮手套。全部的機員，這時都裝上了吸氧的口套，因爲已經迫近敵陣了。這時眼下已經看見了暗淡的大小幾個島嶼，未帶着地圖的我，無法辨認出某一個是某島，只知道飛機正在飛近目標地的瓜達爾加那爾島而已，我於是便把手握得聚緊的。飛機轉入了一個大塊的積亂雲的左側之後，開始打了幾個旋回，雲綫便一時右傾，一時左傾，未幾就看見了黑色的島影，我就隨意斷定那個島一定是瓜達爾加那爾島，因此目不轉睛地注視着那個島。正在這個當兒，引擎的爆音似乎更加大起來，乘坐着的攻擊機，已採取了相當的速度向島影飛過去。</p>
<p>廻照夜空的探照燈</p>
<p>「嘿！瓜達爾加那爾到啦！」我一邊這樣地自言自語，一邊又伸頭向下看。曾記得瓜島的當中有一座高約二千公尺的山，是它的特徵，可是這時所見的却只是一個黑色的島而已。其相貌完全和預想不同了。這不知是不是因爲夜眼看不淸楚土地的高低呢，還是因着飛機的高度關係呢？認爲可作目標的東西竟一點不能當作目標了。坐機這時便從島的某一方面越過了海岸綫，正以爲是向着攻擊目標之敵方飛機塲前進的，這時忽然從黑暗的地上，放出兩道，三道的探照燈的光來，其强烈要比靑白色的月光，明亮到幾十培以上。那細長的光棒這邊那邊不停地向着夜間的天空廻照着，這時我的心裏便暗暗祈禱着「不要被它照着才好呢。正在這個當兒，機首的右下方便飛來了四五個血紅火球而爆裂開來，顏色正像熾熱的鐵，紅中稍帶一點黄色，那就是敵的高角砲彈。「哼！來了！」這樣感覺着，一壁凝視着那些火球，這時地上的探照燈數目也已增加到十架左右了。光捧漸漸迫近坐機，其中有一支好像掠過右翼，在這一瞬間，二支，三支的光芒，已經交集在坐機身上了。搭乘着的整備員，這時對我用手指着下方像告訴我什麽似的，我便向下一看，只見機的下部之方形小窗完全像弧光電燈照着那樣的明亮耀目。這次正在機首的左前方，有高角砲彈爆裂開來。爆開的時候是熾紅色的，後來變成了黑烟，在月光之中可以淸楚看見。除了地上的探照燈之光芒外，處處有驟然一亮而即消失的光可以看見，那大槪是高角砲彈的發射光吧。在近旁爆裂開來的砲彈，其衝動竟震及於機體。這時坐機又急速向右一轉，避開了光芒的照射。</p>
<p>光捧依舊執拗地在天空奔馳迴照着，然而坐機則就此飛出了照射田之外，然後悠然地旋回着，再度看準了敵方的目標。瓜達爾加那爾島的西側三分之一適在白雲之下，然而攻擊的目標却沒有被雲所蔽。一會兒坐機又從〇方再飛到敵的上空去了，不知何故，這番敵的探照燈並不像先前那樣緊張，只有一個地方放出光來，而且光芒完全照射於反對的方向，這正是絕好的機會。這時飛機塲已明白浮現於地上，於是砰，砰，砰，炸彈的炸聲痛痛快快地傳響機哩。這次正是我們的炸彈送到敵的頭上了。我伸首要想去一看中彈時的情形，可是遺憾得很，我坐着的塲所却不能看得淸楚。坐機飛到海岸錢附近，又被探照燈照着了，然而坐機依舊巧妙地避開它的照射。完畢了所定時間的上空制壓後，便須把任務讓給共次的攻擊隊，於是我們的機隊便在皎皎的月光之下，向着根據地飛回來了。這時已是〇時〇〇分，因爲非常興奮之故，一點也不覺得有睡意。歸途中機員取出罐頭食品來，作爲夜食。飛返抵根據地時，我一下機就拿出紙烟來狂吸。（丁：譯自三月四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>滬西警務局長潘達談　改革滬西警務制度　撤除分局派出所集中行政機構　增加值職警員以促進警政效率</h3>
<p>泰晤士報云、滬西警察局局長潘達、昨向記者發表談話、謂渠有意改組滬西警察、取消支局、分局、及派出所制度、而使警務行政集中化、蓋現行制度不如預期之有效、故必須取消分局之制、將全界分成數區、每區設區局、而區局則直接向總局負實、</p>
<p>實力分散捉襟見肘</p>
<p>據潘局長解釋、滬西警力現分為二十單位、包括支局·分局·及派出所等在內、人員總數五百二十三名、故每一單位之人力爲二十七名、每日分爲三班、每班値職警員僅九名、以人數之微、尙欲擔任巡査·特務·及緊急事案如封銷·火警等事、殊有捉襟見肘之虞、因此效率不强、有時甚至祇有一人擔當各該單位之職資、困難極多、而結果遂不及預料之滿意矣、潘局長又稱、如將分局及派出所等撤除、僅賸四支局、則隨時可以出動之警力可大增加、在理論上、每一支局、可得一百三十名、每班四十三名、此一新制又可在總數中抽出一百三十九名、擔任更緊要之工作、換言之、警員效率即增加百分之二十六、</p>
<p>支局與其界綫距離</p>
<p>或問分局及派出所取消以後、支局是否足以單獨擔當所轄區內之警務、潘局長答稱、每一支局離開所轄區域內最遠之處、如自中點度之、僅一公里（即二里）許、步行十分鐘可達、脚踏車三分鐘已足、實際上每一支局與其轄區界綫之距離、步行所需時間如下、（一）第一支局勞動生路、一公里半、十五分鐘、（二）第二支局、極司斐爾路、一又四分之三公里、十七分鐘、（三）第三支局、白利南路、一又四分之一公里、十二分鐘、（四）第四支局、虹橋路、二又四分之一公里、二十二分鐘、現第四支局不久將遷至地段更爲適中之處、他如與總局直接通話之電機、亦將增設、値崗人員可望增多、如上一計劃能經核准、則滬西治安更大有保障矣、</p>
<h3>南市六期授糧　糙米二升半</h3>

<h3>糧管委會改糧食部　採米搬運證仍有效　原用護照延長一個月　三月一日起改名填發</h3>
<p>糧食管理委員會、奉令改組爲糧食部、已於上月一日正式成立、所有食米採辦證、及搬運護照、自應一律改用糧食部及部長銜名、惟此項證照、前由該會分發各區辦事處、及各省市糧食管理局存備填用者、爲數尙多、當此改組伊始、重行印製以及分發應用、手續與時間均感不及、而證照之核發、事實上更不能一日停頓、茲據本報記者探悉、該部決定將原用之糧食管理委員會及委員長銜名之證照、延長塡用一個月、凡屬本年二月底以前可塡發之證照、仍爲有效、自三月一日起、改以糧食部長銜名塡發證照、業經分令該會各辦事處各省市糧食管理局函知各有關係機關外、並於日昨函市府轉飭所屬知照、</p>

<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>上海英美俘虜營一瞥</h3>
<p>— 劉寒若</p>
<p>（一）前奏曲</p>
<p>是參戰第三個月的第一日，春，雖然已降臨江南，但是在朦朧的清晨，仍然是寒意甚濃。</p>
<p>記者團一行，都五十餘人，構成的份子，除了上海區的中日各報記者及各西文報的記者們外，還有京，滬杭綫各地區，華南的香港，長江之北的揚州，安徽省的蕪湖，蚌埠等地的同業，都老遠地跑來參加，這是戰後華中新聞界同志的　大集合，爲了視察中日共同敵人，我們緊携着手，踏巡英美俘虜營一週。</p>
<p>大汽車兩輛，分載着我們一羣，暫時駛出了這繁囂的都市，原野中泛出一片靑的麥浪，使人聞着初春的氣息，農人三五，握鋤耕種於微暖的陽光之下，姿態閑適。道傍的行人們負囊携籃，目送車輛往來飛馳，江南大地上，除了殘璧斷垣之外，已找不出砲火的遺蹟，它蘇甦了，它復興了！</p>
<p>三十分鐘左右的行程，我們到達了目的地，出了汽車，在崗樓的左面，掛著一塊木牌，上面寫着「上海俘虜收容所」，我們一羣魚貫地進了這所門。</p>
<p>（二）營的外貌</p>
<p>佔地約兩百畝廣，在這上面建築了一排一排的房屋，圍繞房屋的是一層電網，那是裏警備層，外警備層是一道短墻，墻上面亦有電纜的設備，介於兩警備層之間的是通行的公路，碎石子舖築，頗整齊淸潔</p>
<p>營屋建築材料，主要的是木，一式平房，被分着士兵居室，官佐居室，醫院，廚房，浴室，厠所，畜牧塲等等，在這平原上，營屋內，被拘留着一千五百名左右的戰敗者。</p>
<p>（三）生活一斑</p>
<p>（一）居室：士兵居室每室十八人，分兩排設置床位，兩室三十六人爲一班，　設班長一人處理事務。官佐居室自少校以上每人居一室，少校以下二人或四人一室，官佐室有禦寒設備，士兵床位上有很厚的褥子，四條毛氈，摺疊都很整齊，室內洒掃淸潔，空氣流通淸新，陽光亦極充足。</p>
<p>（二）息作：上午七時半起床，晚間九時半熄燈。上午八時半至十一時半，下午一至五時爲工作時間，計每日做工七小時。</p>
<p>（三）飲食：每日三餐，兩頓飯，一頓麵包，佐餐品有肉菜湯，牛，羊，或猪肉塊，馬鈴薯，蘿卜，蔬菜，據謂：食品已較現在日本作戰士兵所食爲優。</p>
<p>（四）工餘：工餘之暇，有娛樂設備，美式足球，棒球，乒乓，擊拳，圖書館等等，都是供被俘者作身心娛樂的。</p>
<p>（四）營內速寫</p>
<p>日陸軍進籐軍醫中尉，領導中國記者羣參觀全營。士兵居室內祗有少數人居住着，因爲大多數已出外工作未歸，在室內的士兵，都很健康的樣子</p>
<p>官長室內，我們在門上看見很多銜頭不同的英文姓名，這兒最高的長官是Col．　Ashurst，他住在第一室第一號，房內火爐很暖，他微笑着向參觀者點首爲禮。</p>
<p>飯廳很寬大，玻璃窗有淡黄窗帘設備，很雅緻。</p>
<p>娛樂室是三大間，右面一間放置娛樂用具，當中是乒乓室，左面一間作爲圖書館，架上羅列小說，故事，等書籍，這是萬國紅十字會每月送得來的。</p>
<p>醫院設備太好了，在上海除了公立大醫院之外，恐怕很少有比這兒完備的。特製的避音牆壁，有X光室，太陽燈室，手術室，藥劑室，診療室，齒科診療，化騐室，還有其他醫療上的設備，一時亦記不勝記，就憑這一點，海上的醫院，有幾家能比得上？</p>
<p>經過了浴室，突然一陣陣的肉香鑽進了鼻管，原來我們已到了廚房，廚房分爲三部份，一部是大鍋煮飯及燉茶水，一列的爐灶，正煮白米飯，揭開了蒸鍋，一蓬飯香觸鼻，水壺內水汽直冒，冲着壺蓋聲音很有節奏。另一間是煮肉和烘麵包的所在，司廚者正在切着牛羊肉塊，桌面上堆積着像一座小山阜，微黄的麵包發出香味，三大鐵鍋菜肉湯，看樣子比十六元一客的「羅宋紅菜湯」還有味。再有一間門口標着「菜室」，是專門煮燒菜蔬的。</p>
<p>畜收塲上有羊，鷄，猪，這些都是俘虜們的食品，自養自吃，其味無窮！</p>
<p>（五）大寺所長的詞令</p>
<p>收容所所長大寺敏陸軍大佐，招待記者們談話，承大佐告訴我們：</p>
<p>（一）俘虜總數約一千五百名，一千四百名是美國兵，其餘是英國及其他國籍，他們的來處是威克島·天津·及上海等地。</p>
<p>（二）俘虜羣中很多是技術人員，現在他們已有專門的技術工作。</p>
<p>（三）有九名俘虜曾謀逃亡，但都被追獲，其餘都很安靜地願意生活在營內。</p>
<p>（四）衣着都很充備，不足的由日本當局補充。</p>
<p>（五）通訊辦法是明信片每月一次，信三月一次，由野戰郵便所免費遞送。俘虜們通訊的對象有很多不是他們的家屬家長，而是情人愛人。我想這恐怕是美國少爺兵的特殊性格吧</p>
<p>（六）俘虜羣中有願意學習日本文字，最好者已有日本小學六年級程度。</p>
<p>大寺大佐五十左右的年紀，蓄着短髭，談話誠懇，嚴肅中露着慈祥。大佐在中國已住了四年多，對於中國似很熟悉，末了他慨然地說：</p>
<p>「在靜安寺路上，時常看見很多的中國靑年，穿著嶄新的服裝，挽着妖艷的女人，進出餐館戲院舞塲，或悠閑的散步，這樣淫糜的靑年生活，是非重新加以敎育不可的。」記者羣中有一位答復大佐說：「這是中國上海極小一部份的靑年生活，在上海外面的靑年，大都能刻苦努力，爲新中國復興而奮鬥！」</p>
<p>靑年的朋友們！請你們自己檢點一下，你們有像大佐所說的那樣生活麽？「有則從速改之，無則加緊自勉！」搭上了歸途，時已過午了！</p>
<p>末了，我們對大寺敏大佐的指敎，和烟茶的招待，進籐中尉的領導解釋參觀，陸軍報道部的幫助，還有宣傳部及駐滬辦事處各位的襄贊，他們爲我們規劃一切，使我們能參觀往返順利，表未十二萬分的謝意。對上海以外的同業們，祝福他們歸途平安！</p>

<h3>新興的緬甸（三）</h3>
<p>— 青蓮</p>
<p>（七）日軍治理下的軍政</p>
<p>一九四二年一月中旬，日軍從泰緬國境開始行動，一月三十一日攻陷摩爾門（毛淡棉）三月八日佔領首都仰光，當即轉矛北向，三面合圍曼德勒—瓦城，英印軍和渝軍共約三十萬兵力，竟爲日軍所破，五月一日，攻陷瓦城，五月八日，日軍更突破滇緬國境而進抵雲南省的騰越。</p>
<p>日軍緬甸作戰之神速獲勝，正如英印聯軍緬甸派遣軍統帥亞力山大所承認的，是由於日軍作戰之福出鬼沒，兵器的銳利，和緬人對日本軍的協力。特別是日軍指導下的緬甸義勇軍（B·I·A·），這支軍隊，充滿着緬甸靑年愛國反英的熱血，堅信日本的援助，竟能赤手空拳，爲日軍開闢一條勝利的路。</p>
<p>英印軍退出緬甸後，和平工作立即開始，緬甸的治安在日軍的努力之下奠定了。</p>
<p>日本在緬甸方面最高指揮官飯田，於去年三月八日，頒發布吿，實施軍政。同時設立由緬甸人組織的行政機關，任命巴摩博士等七人爲中央行政機關籌備委員，至八月一日，飯田最高指揮官任巴摩爲行政府長官，在行政府下分設內務，財政，農業，工商，交通灌漑，森林，土木復興，司法，敎育衛生等各部，各部長官，由巴摩召致，而呈請日軍最高指揮官批准。同日宣布根本方針：</p>
<p>（一）軍司令官把握統治之大綱。</p>
<p>（二）對緬甸本身的行政施行，不作無用之干涉。</p>
<p>（三）一切施政之目標，集中於完遂大東亞戰爭之勝利。</p>
<p>（四）努力大東亞共榮圈之建設，使成爲以日本爲中心的大東亞共榮圈之一環。</p>
<p>行政府除上述九部外，尙有長官官房，直轄局，法律顧問及××委員會等四個特別部門，各部長官全由日軍最高指揮官任命。最高指揮官除了直接管轄用兵作戰，外交，敵產，防衛緬甸，及司法諸事項外，其餘行政事務在原則上委任行政府執行之。</p>
<p>行政府以巴摩爲長官，泰京彌亞爲副長官，高野源進爲長官官房長，合力推行政務，而集中於：</p>
<p>（一）迅速確立治安</p>
<p>（二）交通運輸之便捷化</p>
<p>（三）敎育衛生之徹底化</p>
<p>爲期地方民心之安定，與行政府之成立，同時委任出三十七縣的緬籍縣知事，並決定了各縣警察部長人選，各知事繼續治安維持會的工作，在日軍指導之下，以維持治安，推行政務。首都仰光也於九月二十五日宣布爲特別市制，任命烏賽德爲市長。</p>
<p>行政府在日軍指導下，澄淸緬甸過去小黨紛立的局面，促成緬甸最大政黨泰京黨（黨員約四十萬，領袖爲泰京彌亞），和新安沙黨（黨員約十五萬，黨魁爲巴摩博士）兩黨的合併，在「緬甸人建設緬甸」的口號之下展開國民運動。</p>
<p>更可注目的是緬甸防衛軍的編成。即當日軍進駐緬甸領土之時，緬甸靑年層中了解日軍驅逐暴英眞意的份子，即組織緬甸義勇軍，獲得日方兵器彈藥等援助，在各方面蹶起，在仰光及瓦城攻略戰中，與日軍作極大的協力。日軍佔領全緬後，即於七月一日解散所有緬甸義勇軍，在日軍最高指揮官領導之下，編成新的緬甸防衛軍，而義勇軍之大部份，即被吸收進防衛軍去。</p>
<p>緬甸防衛軍，即在兵備局的管轄之下，日夜從事於國境警備及各地駐防等有關防衛的工作，並新設緬甸防衛軍幹部候補生隊，作爲新緬甸的國民軍而在日軍積極訓練中。</p>
<p>（八）新緬甸的經濟</p>
<p>緬甸和蘇門答臘，是「南方圈」內擁有未開發資源最多的地區。在戰前，英國對緬甸投資約五十億鎊，每年可以收穫利潤達投資額的百分之二十。第二次歐洲大戰爆發以來，英國戰時資材中亟需的鎢和錫，幾乎完全取給於緬甸，增產達戰前的一倍，由此也可看出緬旬是英國東方最重要的兵站基地之一。</p>
<p>緬甸是世界聞名的農業國，年產米約六百萬噸，其中三百五十萬噸輸出國外，所以「仰光米」三字，爲世界市塲熟知的名詞。其中六成輸往印度，單只米的一點，就構成了印緬不容分裂的關係。一九四二年的米產額，據傳成績很好，可以補充馬來和蘇門答臘食糧之不足。軍政監部鑒於米的重要性，使日系三社組成日本緬甸米穀管理組合，統制收購，精碾及輸出，早於去年五月五日開始活動。</p>
<p>年產達三十萬擔，大東亞戰爭前且曾輸入日本的緬甸棉花，品質也極良好，如加以改良，前途更不可限量。軍政監部已指定日系三紡績公司，樹立植棉五年計劃，預定到完成年度，生產量可較現在增加多倍。</p>
<p>次於米和棉花的農業資源，以麻栗樹爲主的林產資源，日本緬甸，木材管理組合已由去年四月五日起開始活動，在伊洛瓦底，江和薩爾溫江各區開始採伐。</p>
<p>至於豐富的鑛藏，如鉛，銅，石油，錫等，爲戰爭中主要資源，日方已經在加緊恢復中。</p>
<p>軍政監部爲了開發產業蒐集物資，已設定基金，依次助成米，棉，鑛山，工業，貿易，雜糧，木材等日本當前最重要的事業之發展，此外，對於在改善國民生產非維持治安所必需的各種事業，也積極的援助其發展，並進而考慮日緬共同投資於一切主要的開發事業。</p>
<p>貿易方面，軍政監部實行輸出入業的許可制，經過組合制度，實施輸出入的統制。組成了包括織維，機械金屬，燃料，化學雜品，食品各部門的「緬甸物資配給統制組合」，推進日緬間有計劃的貿易。</p>
<p>財政方面，總方針爲極力减輕日本帝國之財政的負擔，以資經濟戰鬥力之培養，消除非常現象，漸次做到收支相抵的地步，對於防衛緬甸所必需的經費等，也力求某種程度的就地取給主義之實現。</p>
<p>截至八月底爲止的歲出，計爲至行政府成立爲止時期內軍政監部的行政費二十四萬盧比，行政府成立中所需的經費一百數十萬盧比，連其他經費在內，共達一百數十萬盧比。軍政監部至同日止所徵收的租稅，計酒稅二十餘萬盧比，輸出稅二十餘萬盧比，輸人稅十餘萬盧比，鹽稅數十萬盧比，連其他稅收共爲一百數十萬盧比，歲入不足則以臨時透支方式而計入行政府的預算中，</p>
<p>行政府的一般的機構還沒有健全，租稅之徵收，自然也還有不少困難。不過都在努力改善中。行政府今年度的平常預算約一億盧比，稅制等一切，還是承襲舊制，關稅和所得稅則已有若干變更。</p>
<p>撣部聯邦州的預算，去年下半年支出，約爲一百萬盧比。</p>
<p>金融方面，横濱正金銀行自四月十五日起在仰光開設分行，應一般存款和放款之需，該行又於九月一日在巴森，九月七日在摩爾門，十月十五日在瓦城設立「出張所」，其餘各地也在積極籌備中，盡力於緬甸的產業開發事業。此外「南方開發金庫緬甸支庫」也於八月二十四日開業，進行產業融資工作。</p>
<p>另一方面，土着的金融機關，在戰前曾相當地發生着金融上作用的當舖，印度人貸款業者等，還未恢復全面的活動，日軍爲着獎勵開業並加以指導與監督，已於九月二十日由行政府公布放款業條令。</p>
<p>緬甸的英印系銀行，戰前共達二百餘家，現在已經全部封閉，但是爲了避免阻滯金融起見，軍政監部又決定了非敵性銀行准許依次復業的方針。印人組織的「揭貼」銀行首先促其開業。該行在緬甸有四十餘個營業所，將利用以吸收地方游資，使成爲農民庶民的金融機關。</p>
<p>至於緬甸中央銀行之設立，也已積極的籌商着了。</p>
<p>通貨制度，日軍最高指揮官於五月一日公布，就地通貨與日本軍票爲等價法幣，一律通用，因爲原來的緬甸通貨，一盧比合十六安那，一安那合十二披，計算上不方便，又於九月十五日公布調整貨幣單位令，自十月十五日實行一盧比一百錢（分）的新制度。</p>
<p>行政府爲吸收民間浮動的資金，發行了總數達一百萬盧比的獎券，預定以後每年發行同樣數額的獎券四次。</p>
<p>緬甸的財政金融，就這樣在日本有計劃的政策之下走向新的前途。</p>

<p>經濟界　經濟譯論</p>
<h3>論交易所復業問題</h3>
<p>上海本有兩家交易所，一爲中國人之華商證券交易所，一爲外人之衆業公所。前者雖名爲交易所，實則內容未具，徒爲投機之塲台。後者經營之股票交易，計有一百五十五種之多，營業旺盛。此二者，自日軍進駐租界以後，均爲當局所封閉。</p>
<p>交易所雖受封閉，而有價證券之交易實際上仍進行如故。一般遊資紛紛趨入華股買賣之一涂，於是華股交易旺盛無比。價格昂騰，股票公司林立，交易地點散於各處，即爲此時期之現象。大東亞戰爭爆發時，上海股票公司僅有十九家，今則增至一百二十八家，營業之旺盛可知。檢討其致此之由，無非遊資作祟。當局覓求對策，結果乃有恢復交易所之聲明。</p>
<p>恢復交易所聲明之發表，爲去年十月三十日事。當局對茲發表談話稱，復業後之交業所，僅許在軍管理之下經營華商股票幷中央地方公債交易，以謀和平區經濟之復興。至於歷來商人從事投機，將嚴加禁止。十二月一日，日方上海大使館事務所幷發表聲明，登記上塲股票及經紀人，重申恢復交易所之目的在於誘導遊資入於生產部門。自此之後，各方對於交易所之復業，均寄以莫大之願望，然直至今日尙未見諸事實，且聞內部困難重重，一時似難予以解決。雖然，此亦時間事耳，復業一議，將來當有實現之一日。</p>
<p>復業後之交易所，其任務將何如耶？依大使館發表之聲明，復業後之交易所，將以調整股價爲手段，使民族資本能流入必要之產業部門，同時幷察看復業後之成績如何，如屬不惡，則交易對象且將及於其他證券公債。由此而言，華中振興系各公司及共榮圈內各重要產業之股票，亦容有上塲之可能。蓋此類股票上塲以後，當局即可利用上海市塲，導此間遊資於各地重要產業中也。此爲當局恢復交易所之目的，然衡諸事實，則恐不易達到，蓋中國一般利息已高至三分，僅有五六厘之利益，殃不能引起一般人投資之與趣，倘使股票交易純粹流於投機之一途，不特復業原意盡失，且上海通貨膨賬現象尙有波及其他地域之可能。故誘致遊資入於必要產業一事，不能期望於今後之上海交易所也。</p>
<p>雖然，凡茲所云，非謂恢復交易所乃一無意義之事。交易所之恢復，亦可軟禁投機於交易所之內。此點倘能辦到，亦不失爲一大收穫。甚願當局針對此項目標，决然行之。（東洋經濟新報二〇六〇號）</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>經濟警察</h3>
<p>孟子道性善，荀子言性惡。設孟說果確，則人人善良，安分守己，不做損人利己之事，政府平時旣不必有普通警察，戰時亦不必添置經濟警察。然而經騐吿訴我們，人類天性，若讓其自由發展，大多是傾向於損人利己的，故以荀子性惡之說爲較可靠，而法家警察國家之說，亦遂風行於近世東西各國間，即平時設置普通警察以維持治安，戰時添設經濟警察以防制奸商暴利，以維持後方人心之安定是也。</p>
<p>戰時舉世各國推行經濟警察制度，其最稱完善者，聞爲德日兩國。今滬上公共租界當局爲抑制投機，壓低物價，以求民生之安定起見，乃於去年年底，亦有正式籌備組織經濟警察之決定。現巳進行招聘訓練人員，訓練項目之最主要者，爲使之認識上海各項經濟狀態之內慕，並使之學習偵查投機，及其他不法牟利活動之方法。</p>
<p>橘逾淮而爲枳，近世各國之良法美意，一入中國，大多變成利未見而害先滋生之惡現象。其癥結所在，即爲有治法而無治人。故欲經濟警察制度之推行盡善，必須由市政當局以治人之地位，促進治法之周全，庶有效果。</p>
<h3>木村增太郎氏發表金融統制之談話</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行顧問木村增太郞氏日前由京返滬，並對日記者發表關於統制金融之意見如次：一，此次財政當局頒布放款限制辦法，係鑒於奸商運用資金，居奇囤積，引起物價激劇波動，以致不得不於資金流動上設法予以統制之故。今放款限制辦法旣經頒布，則各銀行錢莊之放款當受審査。倘發見其帶有投機色彩，即立予禁止。惟收買農產物及促進工業生產之資金，則當鼓勵銀錢業予以供給。二，實施放款限制辦法，不能以行政權力爲背景，而須基於金融界自動之合作。財政當局與金融界方面爲此已協議數次，決定於銀錢業界中選拔有識之士十數人，爲放款審査委員會委員，政府方面不再派人參加。三，目前金融統制之基本工作，在於限制放款。放款章程二三日內即可製成。關於各銀行之實施合併，目前尙難辦到，蓋此事在中國實行決不如在日本之易云。（支那情報）</p>
<h3>雜糧准許自由買賣</h3>
<p>本報前曾刊載雜糧行將自由買賣消息，今已見諸事實。雜糧公會昨已接獲當局命令。特通吿同業云：査雜糧買賣問題，業經本會與軍配當局洽商，茲蒙當局體念糧商艱困狀况，准如所請。今將辦法開列於左：</p>
<p>（一）有油質之原料黄豆·生仁·芝蔴·菜子·棉花子等五種限定百分之七十五歸軍配當局（限在上海棧房交貨）收買，價格由當局臨時訂定，其餘百分之二十五則由本公會會員自由賣買。</p>
<p>（二）普通雜糧如苞米·紅糧·蠶豆等三種限定百分之五十歸軍配當局）限在上海棧房交貨）收買，價格由當局臨時訂定，其餘百分之五十則由本公會會員自由賣買。</p>
<p>（三）蔴袋自備者，（如新蔴袋者可向本公會轉呈當局核准商借）應由本公會轉向當局申請發給搬運證。</p>
<p>如各同業會會員意欲販賣營業者，應即封樣來會登記云。惟據一般糧商方面意見，認爲當局賜予自由買賣，頗表好感，然因各產區情形不同，且已久乏販運，故大都尙抱觀望態度。</p>
<h3>股票公司六十五家　昨為當局查封　工部局招待報界發表談話</h3>
<p>工部局當局昨爲關於査封無照經營有價證券之公司一事，特發表談話如下：査未獲許可而從事有價證券交易之公司行號，爲數不少，就其營業之內容觀之，多屬不正當之投機買賣，對於物價方面之影響及與一般人心之反響，至深且鉅，在目前上海經濟狀况之下，碍難放任，本局前曾命令査詢中國永昌兩大股票公司，並於三月二日刊發第六二八一號布吿，暗示未獲許可之公司行號，當自動停止營業，然而此等公司行號，對於本局之施策絕未見有協力之意向，因此本局對於下開未獲許可而繼續營業之股票公司十五家，斷然命令査封。關於本局將來對於此等經命令査封之股票公司如何處置，目前尙未至發表時期。所望由於各該公司之査封，彼極不健全之股票投機買賣以及足以煽惑人心之證券漲勢，得吿戢止，而一般遊資，亦得結集於健全企業之投資。至於有價證劵之正當買賣業務自身，原無足非議者，凡依據合法手續獲得關係當局之許可並在關係當局監督之下營業者，本局當無任何異議也。經査封之股票公司列后：</p>

<h3>近日物價上升之由來　囤風仍未消滅　物資需要增加</h3>
<p>最近物價昂騰之原因，約有數端：一，開戰以後之囤貨風氣，仍惰性的持續存在。二，一般人民對於儲備劵固甚信賴，但仍認爲貨物可以隨時換金錢，而金錢則不易隨時可換得貨物。三，一般人多以爲各地物資需要度較前增加。四，戰區附近舊幣不安與囤貨風氣，影響及於上海。倘使金融統制强化，物資交流圓活，則物價當見跌落。（支那情報）</p>
<h3>各地經濟動態雜寫</h3>

<p>嚴格統制的華中捲烟</p>
<p>去年年底所決定由中日雙方合資儲幣六千萬元以統制華中地區的紙烟和烟葉爲業務的華中烟草配給組合在最近期間，即將在上海宣告成立。近月來因捲烟被囤積操縱的結果，以致造成黑市價格的劇漲，他們正在計劃着，無論從零售商以至批發商，將澈底的去阻止和訂定紙烟的標準價格。因實行紙烟的統制和配給制度的結果，上海混亂的捲烟市塲，自當漸漸趨於正常。在這新底配給制度之下，當局決定將有三百處登記的零售商，能自永泰和公司派得限價的捲烟，以低廉的價格；供給銷售云。</p>
<p>華北鋁的增產</p>

<p>人造橡皮在日本發明</p>
<p>博學的日本京都帝國大學敎授Kita氏，在上月發表經過彼長久時間研究的人造綜合橡皮，終於能在一個兼有着經濟和新底方法且易於運用下出現了。此種綜合橡皮在現行戰事中，迨爲不能或缺的軍用原料，因爲它能抵抗强熱和油的侵襲。利用了這新底方法將使綜合橡皮的出產方法變成十分容易及簡單。這新底發明，較諸於目下在德國和蘇聯所使用的方法，更爲經濟和簡單云。</p>
<p>輕油製造的新發現</p>
<p>日本帝國農林試騐所附屬的東京造林試騐局上月宜布在利用新底試騐中，發現一種能供工業和製造業上應用的輕油，正像酒精和安息油一樣，利用了低溫從樹中獲得了它化合的炭質。</p>
<p>從前我們只知道能出產製造輕油的樹林，僅限於松樹和柏樹，但是如能應用這新底發現的方法，從任何的樹中，都能獲得同樣的輕油。</p>

<h3>高島菊次郎繼任華中振興公司總裁</h3>
<p>華中振興公司總裁兒玉謙次氏辭職後，其繼任人選，經當局銓衡之結果，於八日決定任用前王子製紙公司社長高島菊次郞氏，就任華中振興公司第二任總裁，按華中振興公司之第一期事業目標，在於恢復戰禍中所損毀之華中產業，業已完全達到目的，大東亞戰爭發生後，國府繼起參戰，故第二期之目標，側重於加强國府，培養戰力，其意義殊大，兒玉氏功成身退後，由高島氏繼長其缺，高島氏學識經騐宏富，相信必有偉大之貢獻。其略歷如：</p>
<p>明治三十三年畢業於東京高等商業學校，大正元年由三井物產公司轉入王子製紙公司，供職未逾六年，已升常務董事，大正八年升副社長，十三年任社長，十七年十二月辭職</p>
<h3>華方對新總裁表示好感</h3>
<p>又悉，高島菊次郞氏繼任華中振興公司第二任總裁之訊傳來後，華方經濟界一致表示好感，時値日本積極加强國府機構之際，各方對於高島氏期待甚殷，中國銀行沈常務董事特於八日發表談話如次！</p>
<p>高島菊次郞氏，曾於去年來寗，本人在京會晤高島氏，氏對中國頗爲關心，與華人之交誼亦深，相信今後對中日經濟合作必多貢獻。</p>
<h3>前任總裁兒玉謙次任務完成辭職引退</h3>
<p>並悉，前任華中振興公司總裁兒玉謙次氏，於昭和十三年十一月七日就任首任總裁以來，在過去五年中，爲復與戰後瘡痍之華中產業，不遺餘力，舉凡通信，交通，鑛業，電氣，自來水，水產等公用事業及建設上海之一切事業，莫不蒸蒸日上，其所屬公司計有士四公司兩大組合，對於復興產業，開發資源，擴展貿易，厥功甚偉。兒玉氏對中國之關係尤深，明治四十四年即任正金銀行分行行長，歷時十年，昭和十二年三月，正値中日關係緊張之時，氏即以經濟視察團團長資格來滬，擬從經濟提携着手打開僵局，一度緩和雙方國交，旋於同年四月返日，不幸未幾事變發生，氏以華中振興公司總裁地位第三次來華，着手解決中國問題，並中日經濟合作事宜，就任迄今有五年，努力指導華中振興公司之關係公司，今次辭退，各方咸表惋惜（三月九日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>無錫絲市緊俏</h3>
<p>本邑絲價，自舊歷開歲以來，雖然實銷不暢，但市價不斷上漲，目前每擔之售價，較諸去年臘月相差已在一倍以上。考其原因，常不外乎囤戶從中作祟，祗吸勿吐，以致影響人心向上，造成今日之現象。頃據絲業中人談，本邑蠶絲，因事變以來，出產銳减，且銷路小暢、故過去價旣低廉，亦不爲一般囤戶所注意，自去秋物價狂漲以來，游資到處作祟蠶絲遂亦不能例外，一被投機商人侵入染指，頓使市價步步上漲，漫無止境矣。加以當局對絲價尙無限制規定，故其上漲速度，開空前之紀錄，目下市面，若與一年前相較，高漲幾已超過十倍，市面之緊張，已可見一斑矣。</p>

<h3>游資問題的再檢討</h3>
<p>— 陸廷芳</p>
<p>三月四日和五日的申報經濟界，連續刊載了二篇關於吸收剩餘購買力問題的文字。一篇是任雲鵬君所譯廣瀨庫太郞君原作「吸收剩餘購買的芻議」，一篇是仁林君的「吸收剩餘購買力的檢討」。我認爲這問題關繫非常重要。同時，吸收剩餘購買力問題也可以說是整個游資問題的一部份。在仁林君的文字內，曾涉及近來銀行浮動活存的增加，認爲有重行形成剩餘購買力的可能。我想：仁林君對於這認吸收剩餘購買力問題爲游資問題一部份的看法，或亦有同感。</p>
<p>經濟體制中各種病態的存在，常有其互相關聯的因果。要完全消滅各種病態的存在，必須從多種角度講求對策。並且要從最基本的觀點去下手。單純想用頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚的方法去求得解決，是難期收到十足的效果的。我上次所寫的「由企業的苦悶論今後企業的前途」一文中，曾說明欲求物價問題的合理解決，單純從通貨方面著手是不够的。我對於游資問題的看法，也是一樣。</p>
<p>剩餘購買力的吸收，若能推行順利，盡能符合我們的理想，對於游資問題的解決，自然有極大的袖益。不過，在推行的過程中，我們却不能不預計到可能發生的阻力。尤其是所謂强制性的使用商品庫券來收買囤積商品的方法，更能引起民間的反感，而有刺激物價上升的危險。我們在現在固然不必顧慮到囤戶利益，但何者是囤戶的囤積商品，何者是正當工商企業界的存貨，說起來雖然容易分淸，實際上却很難辨別。並且，囤戶們有的是巧妙的方法，强制的辦法雖然定得怎樣嚴密，它們却仍有方法可供趨避。却反使正當的工商企業界有受到殃及池魚的危險，這是可斷言的。我們旣明白，經濟政策的推行，光是靠當局的有決心是不够的，要使實踐的過程中事半功倍，必須要民間——尤其是工商企業界的合作。現在正是我們上下一心推行戰時經濟政策綱領的時候，我們正需要民間作衷心誠意的合作，對於有引起民間反感可能的施策，不能不從大局着想，出之愼重，盡力避免。</p>
<p>所謂剩餘購買力，實際上就是游資的變稱。因爲這種購買力完全握在少數人的手裏，呈著與生產游離的性格。至於社會上的多數人，他們的購買力不但沒有剩餘，而且顯然是不足的。這些游資，它今天用作囤積商品，明天也可以用作銀行中的浮存。從整個的社會作立塲看，游資用作囤貨，一方面囤進商品的人，固然使他的剩餘購買力暫時獲得寄託，一方面出售商品的人，他所獲得的資金還是要尋覓對象的。這對象不是投資，便是投機。採用商品庫券來作收買商品的方式，在吸收游資方面雖然可獲一部分效果，但它的作用和强制推銷一定數額的公債沒有什麽兩樣。並且反多一層有刺激物價上漲的顧慮。在今日，若强制推銷一種公債，無論這公債的用度如何正常，決沒有多少人願意甘心承受。因爲在推銷的方式上一含有强制的性質，便多少减少了證券的信用。况且，即使公債的發行不含强制的性質，在當前市塲利率這樣高昂的情形之下，它的消化情形怎樣，也很難預言。</p>
<p>但是：游資的猖獗，剩餘購買力的作祟，旣然已經使我們受害不淺，我們自然不容置之不問。在這裏，我們不能不說到游資的成因，因爲惟有把握問題的成因，才能作釜底油薪的解決。房福安君在一中國工業月刊」創刊號中曾有五年來上海游資的檢討一文，對於上海游資的情形，有極詳細的叙述。讀者不妨拿來參看。房先生在他的結論中說：「上海原係中國游資集中地區，在戰前，它的數額雖不多，但他的成因，是發生於列强經濟之剝削，與封建之榨取，卒使農村資金流入都市，都市再集中上海。」又說：「今日上海游資之數額，雖較往日激增十餘倍，但發生游資原因，及其爲害影響，均與往日大異。究應如何引導之，使入企業正軌。則爲今日的重大問題。」房君雖沒有說明今日游資的發生原因和往日異點的所在，我們也不難想見今日各種正當生產企業，因受戰時各種人爲的因素而致活動停頓的事實，是促使今日游資發生的最重要原因。現在，各地域間物資交流的高度限制，是唯一束縛生產活動的最大原因，這一原因現在旣能獲得善意的考慮，而酌量間放，必能增進正當生產企業的活動。生產企業的活動，實是吸收游資的最上方策。</p>
<p>此外，像最近所透露的發行彩票，獎勵儲蓄，和改組自治統制機構等，直接間接，都可給予游資問題以良好的影響。</p>

<h3>談機智</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>所謂不識相的人，就是缺少機智的人，因爲他們的應付不得法，而因此失去了友誼的感情，幹事情則「吃力不討好，」努而無功，弄糟了則到處受人恥笑。</p>
<p>禍從口出，無機智的人，往往在無意中得罪了許多人，以至於他不能與人合作；造成厭惡人羣的心理，影響一生的成就。</p>
<p>有機智的人，常能事半功倍，他能把握應該說的時候，他便說，應做的便做，他對人表同情，他在顧到自己的利益時也想到別人的利益，他會用婉轉的語調和氣的口吻，說服反對他的人，他在別人快樂的時候，絕對不說一句掃興的話，他尊敬別人但不是　媚的做作，他能捉住別人的興緻，他不公開別人的弱點，……這些原就是適應環境而具有領袖才幹的倏件。</p>
<p>缺乏機智的原因是一則由於不識時務二則是思想遲鈍，因此這種人是很可憐的，他們的本性並不壞，他們也想過愉快的合羣生活，所以他們在失敗之後，常常自己也不明瞭失敗的原因，他們要奇怪爲什麽自己並不懷有惡意，而人們却都要疏遠自己？</p>
<p>由此看來機智實在是一種做人的藝術。因爲機智要取悅於人，而並不是俗話的「拍馬」，如果誰誤會了機智就是拍馬，那麽也很容易拍馬屁拍到了馬脚上，反而弄巧成拙，變成眞正的卑鄙的失敗者了。</p>

<h3>我們怎樣活着？</h3>
<p>— 鵬雄</p>
<p>我們都知道自己活在世上，可是不一定人人都知道我們的身體是在怎樣活着；假使人人能明白了這問題，亦許會使一部分人更能珍視自己的身體。</p>
<p>爲了人體好比一架機器，要使這機器動作，就得加煤生火，我們身體所需的煤就是食物，所生的火就是吸入肺中的氧氣。我們一日三餐所吃東西雖然五花八門，但主要的材料成分却祗是蛋白質，脂肪質和水炭素，這三種東西存在於食物中時大都不能直接身體應用，必須先經一番調整的工作，這種工作就是「消化」。我們把食物呑進口中後，先後經食管及胃而入腸，在口及胃中先把食物消化了一都分，一面使大塊的東西變成小塊，一面使固體的東西變成液體。到了小腸中，一面還是繼續消化，以利吸收，一面却由小腸壁把有用的成分「吸收」入乳糜管中。吸收之後所餘的殘渣已是無用廢物，就移到大腸，從肛門口「排洩」出來。</p>
<p>養料被吸收進乳糜管後，還須繼續輸至全身各部以供應用，這就要靠血液的「循環」了。血液的循環由心和血管所造成，心臟的作用一面好比一架抽水機一面好比一架打水筒，心的兩端，各與動脈血管及靜脈血管相聯，而動靜脈又藉微血管之媒介而互相聯貫，所以心和血管好像成了一套首尾相通的橡皮管，心每跳一次，就把　脈中的血抽入心中，同時父把血打進　服，心跳一直不斷，就使血液在這套橡皮管中周而復始地循環運行。乳糜管與這　橡皮管亦相通聯，所以它所吸收得的養料可以由此加入血中，跟着血液的循環而被輸至全身各部去。</p>
<p>全身各部旣有煤送到，就得生火燃燒了，這步工作就由「呼吸」完成。我們都知道燃燒是必需氧氣存在的，我們由口鼻中吸入的空氣內就含有充足的氧氣，經過氣管和枝氣管而到肺中後，氧又在肺內跑進了血液，於是亦跟着動脈血液送到全身各部，把各部所接到的養料加以燃燒，產生了熱和能，全身各部生出的炭酸氣又都靠靜脈血送到心，由心到肺，再經枝氣管及氣管而在口鼻中呼出。這樣說了我們就可明白：養料由腸吸收入血，氧由肺中入血，二者都由動脈血管送到全身各部。</p>
<p>但是煤被燒去後，除了冒烟之外還有煤渣，况且旣有然力發生亦必定會生出水蒸汽。體內養料被燃燒後剩下的殘液，大部仍由血液送到排洩器官——腎　，在尿中「排洩」出去。</p>
<h3>讀書切忌不求甚解</h3>
<p>— 棄疾</p>
<p>學問之道，最小能放鬆的是一個「問」字，就是要有一種打碎沙鍋問到底」的精神，處處地方要求一個澈底解釋，不能隨隨便便讓它不明白就不明白。可是不知怎樣的，那位晋朝的大學者陶淵明先生竟會出人意料地在他的五柳先生傳中放下這樣兩句名句：「好讀書，不求甚解，」到了淸代，那位袁子才先生更好像唯恐道層意思被人遺忘了似的，又做了二句詩，說他自己有一種習慣，就是「不先詣客來還答，最愛看書過亦忘。」靑年學子本來孜孜不倦，逢到難題，總要細加思索，推原其理的，讀了道幾句書，便不禁　疑起來，以爲古人讀書，原來都抱這種優游從容的態度。</p>
<p>讀古書就怕這樣斷章取義，最容易發生誤解。五柳先生傳中「好讀書，不求甚解，」之下，就是「每有會意，便欣然忘食，」假使陶先生眞的讀書不求甚解，他怎麽能讀出如此好的滋味來，竟至於忘了飲食。再說袁子才，不要說別的，單單他那部隨園全集，卷帙之浩繁，已足驚人，如果他眞的看了書都忘掉的，他能寫得出這許多詩文來嗎？由此可知他們所謂不求甚解，最愛看書過亦忘等，無非是表示他們的閑適。</p>
<p>讀書非但不可不求甚解，而且應當處處地方求其澈底了解，逢到疑難的地方，必須要探源溯流，窮根究底，更不要怕多問，比自己程度高的人要問，和自己程成差不多的人也不妨互相切磋，務求澈頭澈尾的明瞭爲止。如此然後對於書中所說的話，自然會覺得有興趣，叫他不往下讀，他也不肯釋手了。曾文正公在講讀書記性的時候，曾有過這樣幾句話，「……若實看明白了，久之必得些滋味，寸心若有怡悅之境，則自略記得矣。」鄭板橋也說過，「讀書以過目成誦爲能，最是不濟事，眼中了了，心下忽忽，方寸無多，往來應接不睱，如看塲中美色，一眼卽過，與我何與？」又說：「有費解處，另紙摘出，求解於先生，」這種把費解處摘出來，以備求解於人的方法，很値得我們効法。</p>
<h3>交友之道</h3>
<p>— 建行</p>
<p>上月二十七日，顧政　先生在靑年會演講「我自己在生活裏體騐到的和正在體騐着的眞理」，中間有一段是講「交友之道」，鄙人聽了，頗爲感動，茲將訊憶所及，筆記下來，以供同好。</p>
<p>「我國人對於友道，向來非常注重。古人把它列爲五倫之一，與「君臣」「父子」「夫婦」「兄弟」等關係視爲同樣重要。在東方是如此，在西方亦有同樣情形。英國文豪培根在他一篇「論交友」的論文裏說過這麼一句話：「一個眞正的朋友楚一個人的另一個自己。」的確，一個眞正的朋友，不但在心情方面能給我同情，諒解，和安慰；同時在事業方面他更能給我欣賞，鼓勵，和助力。」</p>
<p>朋友旣是這麼重要，然而有許多人却是交不到朋友，這是什麼原因呢？對於這個問題，顧先生的答覆是：「當然原因是很複雜的，不過最大的原因恐怕是因爲自己太自私了。要知道一個只顧自己不顧別人，只知享受不知貢獻，只求獲得不思給予的人，心中雖然渴望着朋友，而朋友總是不會來俯就他的。」</p>
<p>交友而懂得交友的方法固然是最好，但是在某種情況之下，方法也是無濟於事的。在這兒顧先生提出了一件事實。「記得在大學　書的時候，有一偭外國間學，性情孤僻，無人跟他做友。一天他參加演購比賽，題目是「友誼」。他說：「我在小學的時候，我有許多朋友；我在中學的時候，我有幾個朋友；現在我在大學，連一個朋友也沒有！「他雖然沒有把交友所以會逐漸困難的原因說出來，但在事實上，成年人交友的確比幼年人困難得多。」</p>
<p>「交友與年齡固然有很大的關係，但是關係最大的却是一個人自己對於朋友的態度。因爲一個人對於人家的態度可以決定人家對於你的態度。記得我剛進大學的時候，有一個時期見同學都對我掛着長臉，我那時枚不出所以然來。一天，我正在衣鏡前穿衣的時候，猛一抬頭，見自己的臉原來是掛得長長的！」說至此處，哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>「孔子說：「已所勿欲，勿施於人。」耶穌說：「你要人怎樣待你，你先怎樣待人。」凡要獲得朋友的人，對於這兩句訓話，應當加一番思索，做一番研究。」顧先生以二句爲聖人作「交友之道」的結論。</p>
<h3>「嘸啥」</h3>
<p>— 史新</p>
<p>布衣老人張雲老開口「老百姓」，大陸新報竹本氏出嘴「窮庶民」，快靑兄到處「我是台灣人」。這三件事看起來好像「嘸啥」。但是仔細想想倒很有點「啥」在裏面似的。中國老百姓對於政治似乎完全沒有力量，可是很奇怪，誰不能抓住老百姓，誰就不能維持其政權！打仗的當中，庶民對於國家的效力頂大。庶民的向背可以決定國家的興亡。大東亞共榮圈裏面，大大小小有十幾種的民族，對這些民族問題解決如何，與此决戰爭之勝敗是有很大的關係。</p>
<p>大東亞問題的關鍵，誰說不是凝結在此三件「嘸啥」的裏頭呢！</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>兪寫周和楊子傑同時叫出了一聲「三小姐」，兪寫周也從椅子上立起了一些。</p>
<p>她叫了他們一聲，就走到黄崇庵的面前。大家都很興奮，用精神注意着她的一舉一動。他們，連她的父親在內，都覺得他遠非她的二個姊姊可比。她有他大姐的剛勁，但也有他二姐的溫柔，同時，他却沒有她大姊的急躁和二姊的懦怯。她的出現，就好像春天或秋天的晚上，一輪皓月，湧上東山，照徹了每一個幽暗的角落上，使人感到一陣莫名的愉快人。</p>
<p>「爹爹」，她叫了一聲，就在炕邊一張机子上坐了下來。面孔一迥過來，正對著賑桌上的燈，在根明的眼裏，只是一片燦爛，分不出那是燈光，那是容光。香煙的煙沒有了，銅壺中的水蒸汽沒有了，就只有淡淡的水煙的煙，蒙不住這些光。</p>
<p>「有湄，幸虧你，不然，……」其餘的話和水烟一同呑入了腹中。</p>
<p>「爹爹，我說明年一定要送弟弟到學校裏去讀書才是」。</p>
<p>「三小姐，這個令尊早已叫我和篤周先生說過了」，楊子傑邀功地說，『明年就進篤周先生的學堂。篤周先生的管敎是素來很嚴的』。</p>
<p>「篤周先生的管敎，我也知道，」有湄對兪篤周看了一眼，兪篤周連忙坐坐正，將背脊直了一下。「不過我想弟弟最好住到一個同學很多的學校裏去，那末，他的一切壞脾氣也訐就會改掉了。」</p>
<p>「三小姐，」楊子傑興匆匆地將鬍子一抹說，「我不是要批駁你；但我以爲住到學校裏去，恐怕正會學着許多壞脾氣，還是住在家裏好。何况新式的學校還不及舊式的私塾好。……</p>
<p>「楊先生，你那裏知道，……她侃侃地聲說了好一會。　（八）社會服務</p>

<h3>Stabilizing the Market and Increasing Production</h3>
<p>The severity of the price problem has yet to be thoroughly eliminated. Not only are the general public in this city still suffering from soaring prices with no end in sight, but the price fluctuations in other regions are also not to be ignored. Therefore, stabilizing prices and the market is still an urgent task; otherwise, public anxiety and social unrest will be a major obstacle to the implementation of wartime national policies. The authorities should be supported in strictly implementing price controls. However, to make price controls have a practical effect, it is not enough to arrange the price control plan and techniques meticulously and appropriately, as we have detailed in the previous week. More importantly, it is necessary to lay a solid foundation for price controls: one is to stabilize the currency value, and the other is to increase production. Other measures, such as solving the problem of floating capital and strictly prohibiting hoarding, cannot be ignored, of course. But in terms of fundamental solutions, stabilizing the currency value and increasing production are more important than others. We must understand that the most basic leading factor in price increases is the depreciation of the currency. According to expert estimates, only one-third of the factors contributing to past price increases belonged to materials, while two-thirds belonged to currency. Therefore, to alleviate soaring prices, we must first focus on "stabilizing the currency value." The former Japanese Minister Aoki and others' expression of determination to maintain the Chinese new currency is an important countermeasure in light of this. We hope that the authorities will use greater determination to stabilize the currency value, which is not only the cornerstone for the success of the price control policy but also the prerequisite for promoting the normal development of China's wartime economy; otherwise, all other efforts will at least be "twice the effort for half the result."</p>
<p>However, the importance of material factors should not be underestimated at the same time. The phenomenon of material shortages is gradually becoming more obvious. Some people say that the skyrocketing of prices is not due to a lack of materials because merchants in various places hold a lot of goods. With so much inventory, it is difficult to call it a lack of materials. In fact, this is a myopic view. We must know that the needs of the current war are not a matter of a day or two. Although the inventory collected by hoarders is not small, it is limited after all. Moreover, except for certain military supplies and special equipment, the main daily necessities still rely on production in various places for supply. Moreover, due to the difficulty of transportation during the war, the source of materials is more singular and shorter. The needs of all parties are endless, while the available materials are limited. Therefore, those who hold these goods regard them as rare commodities to be hoarded, and they are not afraid even with strict laws and severe penalties. If our production can greatly solve the needs of all parties, then hoarders will not be able to hoard. Recently, the call from all parties to increase production is due to this; otherwise, all price controls and regulations will fail.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to production, we must point out that there are still many factors that are unfavorable to the development of production. First of all, there are various shortcomings in the operators of production businesses themselves, such as errors in business objectives, insufficient intensity of work, difficulties in capital planning, leaders who are not ideal, and the inability of various industries and departments to cooperate with each other. These are undeniable facts. To enable China's production to develop and supply greater output, these shortcomings must be overcome. In order to overcome these shortcomings, it is naturally necessary to improve labor-management relations, improve work efficiency, and make full use of production equipment. On the one hand, it depends on the national and ethnic ideology, far-sighted political vision, and leadership ability of the leaders of the production business; on the other hand, it depends more on the government's comprehensive planning and enthusiastic support, especially for private enterprises to be responsible for mediation, providing short-term working capital, or lending long-term funds. We believe that close cooperation between the government and the private sector can truly achieve the ideal results of production.</p>
<p>In the actual actions of the government and the private sector to jointly increase production, an important issue that must be resolved is the issue of "planned production." We must solemnly point out that China today does not yet have the social conditions to implement strict and complete planned production. Objectively, it is only a country where small-scale commodity production dominates. Subjectively, the supply of public funds and equipment is still very limited. There are many social factors that hinder planned production, and to implement planned production, we must first clarify those hindering social factors. This involves too much and cannot be expected in the short term. Then, talking about planned production under the circumstances of "patching up loopholes" will inevitably lead to the path of official control. The facts and lessons of official business since the late Qing Dynasty teach us, and the facts and lessons of the official control in Chongqing teach us, that the style of procrastination and perfunctoriness has affected many production businesses, and that subtle personal relationships have added many burdens to the industry. As for the phenomenon of stopping private enterprises on the one hand and opening the same state-owned enterprises on the other, the waste is self-evident. It is not a blessing for the country and the nation to blindly copy the methods of other countries regardless of the country's situation. But we also oppose an unconditional laissez-faire policy, and we must weigh the urgency and compare the importance in expanding production. We always believe that the government's task lies in leading and assisting, not in interfering and restricting, and even less in operating some businesses that the people can operate beyond the existing conditions. Some people think that if the government does not control a large amount of materials, it will not be able to stabilize prices. In fact, this is a one-sided view. As long as the government can mobilize the people, rely on the people, and effectively cut off hoarding, properly deal with the problem of floating capital and stabilize the currency value, and increase the materials for production, even if it does not completely belong to state-owned enterprises, even if it is not completely controlled by the government, the supply on the market will obviously increase. If the supply on the market increases, will the stabilization of prices not be more effective? Conversely, if we do not work hard to encourage the production of private enterprises, then in a certain period, using certain methods, we can control some materials, but we will not continue to supply them in large quantities, will it not be more difficult to stabilize prices?</p>
<p>In short, stabilizing the currency value and increasing production are the fundamental ways to implement the price control policy and the entire price policy; and increasing production requires close cooperation between the government and the private sector. With stable prices and a stable market, people's livelihoods can be improved, and all wartime national policies can be expected to be implemented.</p>

<h3>The Significance of the New Operations in Burma</h3>
<p>The Japanese dispatch army, seeing that the enemy has made another foolish attempt to recapture Burma, immediately mobilized elite troops from both land and air to begin new operations.</p>
<p>The result of this operation is not only to destroy the enemy and ensure the security of Burma, but also to have an excellent impact on the Indian people, which is even more noteworthy. Since Mahatma Gandhi's hunger strike, the anti-British movement in India has become increasingly mature. Therefore, the British-Indian army wanted to overcome Burma, in order to alleviate the anti-British atmosphere in India or suppress its anti-British movement, but its plan did not succeed and still failed, but instead promoted the Indian people's determination to resist the British. Facts will soon prove its misjudgment.</p>
<p>But we cannot underestimate the enemy's intentions. General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British-Indian army, has repeatedly stated: "Burma is one of the most important strategic points, and in order to get in touch with Chongqing, we must recapture Burma. I am constantly studying ways to recapture Burma." Roosevelt also believed that since the counteroffensive in the South Pacific could not be fulfilled, it was best to strengthen the base on the Chinese mainland to bomb the Japanese mainland. However, since aid to Chiang could not be sufficient now, there was still no way to achieve the goal. The only way was to recapture Burma and reopen the aid-to-Chiang route. Apart from this, there was no other way. The visit of He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration of Chongqing, to India and the frequent exchanges between important enemy figures, these facts tell us that the enemy is discussing this matter separately, so we must know that the enemy will inevitably launch operations to recapture Burma and further strengthen its forces to attack.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, since the strategic success of Guadalcanal Island, the outer barrier of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere has been consolidated and firm, and we have seized the dominant position in launching the offensive, and we are working hard to complete the great cause of construction while fighting. In particular, the construction of Burma has made significant achievements. Prime Minister Tojo also said in his statement to the Diet that Burma's independence is likely to be realized this year. We are fully aware of how anxious and uneasy the enemy is about this. They will definitely not wait for Burma's independence to succeed, and they will counterattack Burma. Not only this, but they are probably going to launch counterattacks in other aspects as well. In addition to thanking the Japanese army for defending the front line and destroying the enemy's counterattack, we must also remember that not only the construction of Burma, but also the construction of any place is built in the face of a major enemy, in the smell of gunpowder.

<h3>Supreme Advisor Ishiwata Returns to Nanjing Yesterday to Issue a Statement: The Value of Savings Certificates is Determined to be Maintained; Measures for Prices and Rice are Being Planned</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, returned to China to discuss the economic issues after the change in Japan's policy towards China. He completed his mission and arrived in Nanjing by plane from Fukuoka at 3 pm on the 9th.</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. Mr. Ishiwata, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, returned to the country to report on his work last month and returned to Nanjing by plane at 3 pm on the 9th. At 6:30 pm on the same day, he met with reporters at his official residence and issued a statement as follows: When I was in Tokyo, I had cordial talks with Prime Minister Tojo, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, and Minister of Finance Kaya. Some people in Japan were skeptical about the National Government's participation in the war. I told them that the purpose of the National Government's participation in the war was to seek mutual cooperation between China and Japan, to work hard to increase production in order to win the war. Regarding the currency issue, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki stated in the Diet that he was determined to maintain the current ratio of 18 yuan of military currency to 100 yuan of reserve certificates, so people feel very stable. In other words, even if the military currency is gradually withdrawn at a certain time, and the reserve certificate is unified, the same ratio between the reserve certificate and the Japanese yen will still be maintained. Therefore, the relationship between the United Reserve Bank notes and the reserve certificates will not change. The Japanese side will, for the currency of China and the South, assume that when the reserve certificates have been unified, it will be true to its original intention of supporting military currency and cooperate in maintaining the value of the reserve certificates. This method of cooperation, such as reviving the factories of Shanghai and Tianjin, or even using existing inventory, depends on the industrial productivity of these industrial cities and the state of the rural economy in the interior. The price problem is an urgent problem at present. The Japanese side has also assisted the National Government in planning various countermeasures, the most important of which is the rice problem. The Japanese side is also considering the National Government's position in this regard and is carefully planning measures.</p>
<h3>West of Yuezhou, the Japanese Army Successfully Crossed the Yangtze River, and is Continuing to Advance Towards a Certain Place</h3>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. The Japanese Chinese Expeditionary Force announced at 16:00 on the 9th that the Japanese army carried out a river crossing in front of the enemy on the night of March 8 in an area about 300 kilometers upstream of the Yangtze River west of Yuezhou and began to attack Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. According to a certain base of the Japanese army, the various units of the Japanese army stationed in Central China previously completely annihilated about 10,000 soldiers of Wang Jinzai's army and three divisions of a certain army in the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing. Recently, they began to attack the Fourth Army Wang Zejun's troops, the 49th and 150th/12th Divisions of the Sixth War Zone in the south of the Yangtze River. Since the night of the 8th of this month, the Japanese army used elite troops to boldly carry out a successful river crossing in front of the enemy at a certain place on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They immediately eliminated the Chongqing army's resistance and broke through the various units deployed there. Then, at 12:00 on the 9th, with the close cooperation of the Japanese Army Air Force, they attacked a certain place, an important point of the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing. Another Japanese army unit secretly crossed the river in a certain place on the Yangtze River and is still advancing towards a certain place under the fierce artillery cover of the Japanese army. This time, the Japanese army dispatched a large number of elite troops to Jiangnan to carry out an offensive operation, which will surely deal a great blow to the Sixth and Ninth War Zones of Chongqing.</p>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. After the Japanese army crossed the south bank of the Yangtze River west of Yuezhou on the night of the 8th, they defeated various Chongqing army units and continued to advance forward. They are now approaching a certain place. The fall of this place is imminent. A certain vanguard force of the Japanese army attacked from the east and crossed the Yangtze River at Dazui Port, about 30 kilometers west of Yuezhou and about 3 kilometers east, to the edge of Dongting Lake on the afternoon of the next day, and rushed into and occupied Jiaoshan Heshi, about 35 kilometers southwest of Jianli. At present, the Japanese army is still chasing the remnants of the Chongqing army to the south.</p>
<p>Hankou, Central News Agency, 9th. According to a certain base of the Japanese army, the Japanese army units boldly crossed the Yangtze River on the 8th and attacked the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing. At the same time, the Japanese Army Air Force dispatched to cooperate with the operation. The Air Force departed from a certain base at dawn today in a large formation of several platoons and drove straight to bomb the Chongqing army positions about 46 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou and Huang Gongmiao (20 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou) repeatedly. It used machine guns to shoot down the Chongqing planes that were fleeing in embarrassment, and achieved great results. The Japanese planes then returned to their original defense.</p>
<p>Crushing the Lu-Chong Joint Forces in Central Shandong</p>
<p>Qingdao, Central News Agency, 9th. After the Japanese elite troops annihilated the main force of the Chongqing "113th Division and the Second Column of the Daredevils" on the 11th of last month, they launched a new operation against the Chongqing-Communist joint forces entrenched in the mountainous area of central Shandong on the 27th of last month. On the 2nd of this month, they planned to annihilate the main force of the Chongqing "51st Army 114th Division 683rd Regiment," about 800 people, in the Beizhuang area, 25 kilometers southeast of Yuezhuang. After annihilating them all at once, they turned their guns on March 6 and fiercely attacked the Chongqing army "4th Brigade of the Shandong Column," more than 400 people, in the mountainous positions surrounding Lianhuo Mountain. As a result, its main force was completely defeated. As of the 6th, a total of 549 corpses of Chongqing-Communist troops were left behind, and 162 people were captured. The Japanese army also seized two flat-firing guns, one light mortar, three heavy machine guns, eight light machine guns, two automatic rifles, 243 rifles, 114 rounds of ammunition, four pistols, and a large number of other military supplies.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, Central News Agency, 8th. In the dangerous area in southern Shanxi Province, the Japanese elite troops braved the severe cold and continued their sweeping war. On February 10, they launched a sweeping war against the Chongqing army's Wu Zhongliu troops entrenched in the Zhongtiao Mountains and annihilated them. The overall results of this battle are as follows: 17,287 enemy soldiers killed, 1,174 captured, and countless supplies seized.</p>
<p>Shijiazhuang, Central News Agency, 9th. During the middle of February, the Japanese army units launched a mopping-up operation against the remaining Communist forces in the southern and central Hebei areas. The comprehensive results that have been verified are as follows: 451 engagements, 48,389 Communist troops, 7 Communist military facilities destroyed, 1,445 captured, 1,290 Communist corpses abandoned, and seized items include light mortars, automatic rifles, Mauser rifles, pistols, hand grenades, various ammunition, and many other clothing and food.</p>

<h3>Li Yingping, Commander of the Chongqing Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, Leads His Troops to Return</h3>
<p>Qingdao, Central News Agency, 9th. Li Yingping, the commander of the Chongqing Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, had previously actively expanded his forces with Zhucheng and Rizhao counties in eastern Yue Dong as the center. However, since the National Government's participation in the war, he realized that the Chongqing resistance war was no longer meaningful. He planned to lead his troops to return. On the 2nd of last month, he was attacked by a fierce Japanese elite force. Li Wenli, the commander of the Second Column, and Han Zigan, the commander of the 113th Division, and most of the cadres, have been captured. Therefore, Mr. Li took this opportunity to lead 5,000 troops to return and pledge allegiance to the National Government.</p>
<p>Qingdao, Central News Agency, 9th. Li Yingping, the commander of the Chongqing Sixth Guerrilla Detachment, who led 5,000 troops to participate in the peace movement this time, is from Gaomi County, Shandong Province. After graduating from the Northwest Military Academy in the 17th year of the Republic of China, he joined the old Northeast Army. He resigned and returned to his hometown of Gaomi in May of the 25th year of the Republic of China. After the July 7th Incident occurred in the same year, he was instructed by Chongqing to organize a guerrilla detachment and served as the commander. He had considerable influence in the area of Zhucheng, Rizhao, Anqiu, and Juxian. According to Yu Xuezhong's Chongqing army in that area, since General Wu Huawen's participation in the peace movement in January this year, followed by the complete destruction of the 113th Division on February 21, and now Li Yingping leads his troops to participate in the peace movement, Yu Xuezhong has lost another 5,000 troops. Therefore, Yu's remaining forces, with only a part of the 114th Division, are about to be completely destroyed. Li Yingping's return with his troops has made the clearing of the Chongqing Communist camp in Lu more strengthened.</p>
<h3>Ping City Party Department Officially Established</h3>
<p>Beijing, Central News Agency, 9th. The Beijing Special City Party Department of the Chinese Youmin Party has been officially established under the active preparation of Director Lei Zaomin. The ten district party departments of the city were also established simultaneously on March 1. The registration of old party members and the joining of new party members are now being actively carried out, and various tasks are also being planned and implemented.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss Returns Home</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency, 9th. According to Chongqing news, the US Embassy in Chongqing announced that US Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss will leave Chongqing this week to return to the country to report on important matters and is scheduled to return to his post in two or three months.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Stipulates One Meat Meal Per Week</h3>
<p>Madrid, German News Agency, 9th. According to reports from New York, American newspapers have published many reports on the difficult living conditions in Chongqing. It is said that in addition to prohibiting restaurants from holding grand banquets, Chiang Kai-shek has also stipulated that meat can only be enjoyed once a week. The rations of vegetable oil and sugar have recently been reduced again, and luxury goods have been completely prohibited. All card games have been banned, and officers are not allowed to ride in sedan chairs, and women are not allowed to perm their hair.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Can Now Remit Money to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency, 9th. Remittances from overseas Chinese in Vietnam to Guangdong have begun after mediation by the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam and the local Consulate General. The first batch of remittances, 17,400 yuan in reserve certificates, has been remitted to families in Guangzhou and its surrounding areas through the Yokohama Specie Bank and has arrived. The remittance of this item, whether at any time, each time, each person is less than 50 Vietnamese currency, can be sent without requesting permission. Under the direction of the Consul General, the Yokohama Specie Bank will send it to the families of overseas Chinese through Guangdong Yuli Company and Zhongnan Company.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Memorial Day, the Japanese Army Stationed in Beijing Will Inspect Today</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 9th. This month's 10th is Japanese Army Memorial Day. It is reported that the Central Broadcasting Station of the capital will broadcast the actual situation of the live ammunition attack and defense exercise held near Qingliang Mountain at 10:00 am this morning to celebrate. In order to make Chinese and foreign visitors understand the situation of the attack and defense exercise, loudspeakers are specially installed in Qingliang Mountain. The station will send staff to report in Chinese and Japanese to increase the interest of the audience. The station will also invite Qin Hanqing, the commander of the Second Guard Division, Li Zhonggang, the Major General of the Capital Garrison Command and concurrently the Director of the Military Law Office, Guo Tianyi, the Chief of Staff of the Second Guard Division Command, and Wang Zhitang, the Chief of Staff of the Capital Garrison Command, to hold a officers and generals symposium at 10:10 pm, entitled "Swear to Destroy Britain and the United States with Japan," which will be broadcast to all parts of the country.</p>
<h3>You Are the Only One: Principles to be Followed in Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>There is a very common saying in Chinese, "非是你不成" (fēi shì nǐ bù chéng), which can be translated into Japanese as "君じゃないとダメだ" (kimi ja nai to dame da) - "It can't be done without you." This phrase implies humility when making a request. However, besides humility, it also carries a sense of entrusting something to the other party. It is truly a case of "few words with deep meaning." In the future relations between China and Japan, both countries should keep in mind this idea of "It can't be done without you," and "You are the only one."</p>
<p>If we say that China and Japan are brotherly nations, then the respect and humility of the younger brother respecting the older brother, and the older brother loving the younger brother, are indispensable.</p>
<p>China and Japan are embarking on a great path of sharing joys and sorrows. Not only should we use the phrase "It can't be done without you" verbally, but we must also engrave it in our hearts and minds. The more opportunities there are to use this phrase, the closer the relationship between the two sides will be. As long as we are sincere, any problems that arise between China and Japan in the future can be resolved with laughter. No matter what difficulties we encounter, I believe it will be easy to find a solution.</p>
<p>The various problems and difficulties arising from the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions can also be resolved smoothly if both China and Japan unite in spirit and embrace the mentality of "It can't be done without you."</p>
<p>At the tea party hosted by important figures in Nanjing last time, I also used the phrase "It can't be done without you" and explained to the attendees the principle of mutual assistance between China and Japan. They all listened to me with sympathetic and approving expressions. Although I am not good at speaking fluent Chinese, I also felt very happy.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of China's participation in the war, Japan's policy towards China has made rapid progress, and the planned policies are being implemented one by one. China has also responded to Japan's policies and transformed its policy towards Japan, reaching a time when China and Japan are moving in the same direction. In such a critical situation, do the Chinese masses have a clear understanding and firm confidence? If only the Japanese think this way, and the Chinese cannot provide assistance, then true cooperation cannot be achieved. I am still worried about this. "It can't be done without you" is a Chinese saying, and since China already has this saying, it should be used. There is no shortage of patriots among the Chinese people, but on average, they seem to lack a sense of national consciousness, and there are many who are calculating their personal gains and losses. Although it cannot be said that there is no sense of unity for the sake of the country, this sense of unity still feels weak. Therefore, Chinese people must now embrace the spirit of "It can't be done without you" and "You are the only one" and cooperate with Japan to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The focus of public education towards Japan is also here. At the same time, we Japanese residents should also savor the meaning of this Chinese saying and generously assist in the reconstruction of China.

<h3>German Troops Attack in the Rain, Reaching the Western Suburbs of Kharkov; Central Route Continues to Shorten Defense Line; Vyazma Becomes Main Battlefield</h3>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): The German Supreme Command announced today that fierce battles on the Eastern Front continue. German forces are able to control the military situation on the entire front, adopting offensive tactics at certain points, defensive tactics at others, or avoiding engagement with enemy forces and shortening their lines. Operations are not proceeding according to the original plan. German forces in the Kharkov area continue to advance, while fierce Soviet attacks are repelled. In the Orel and Susa areas, German forces, although under attack, are holding their positions. Soviet forces have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 9th (Havas News Agency Telegram): Yesterday's fighting on the Eastern Front showed two trends: one, that German forces are attempting to swiftly recapture Kharkov; and two, that Soviet troops are still fiercely attacking towards Vyazma. German troops near Kharkov are attacking in the rain and have reached twelve miles west of Kharkov. German artillery is already shelling the city. German forces in the central sector continue to shorten their lines and have withdrawn from Gzhatsk and Sichevka to prevent encirclement by Soviet forces. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army is continuing to advance southwest and northwest of Gzhatsk and has retaken six lost areas south of Volynino and west of Rzhev. West of Sichevka, the Red Army is advancing towards the Bryansk-Kirov railway line, with the apparent aim of encircling Bryansk. Fierce fighting is taking place between Sichevka and the Tesna River. West of Rzhev, there is only localized fighting. The Vyazma area has now become the main battlefield. The main target of the Red Army's attacks appears to be Nikitinka, a town located 140 miles west of Moscow, but its ultimate goal is to encircle Vyazma. Berlin claims that repeated Red Army attacks have been repelled.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): An announcement here last night stated that German forces are rapidly advancing and have reached a point 20 kilometers west of Kharkov.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Responsible sources here revealed that Soviet forces have lost another 7,000 men in the forest area south of Kharkov. The previous day, German forces captured another 3,000 Soviet soldiers, seized 38 tanks, 23 artillery pieces, 65 tanks, several anti-tank guns, and hundreds of vehicles.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): According to the latest reports from the Eastern Front, German forces are launching fierce offensives against newly established Soviet defenses south and west of Kharkov. After retreating on Sunday, Soviet forces have built another defense line on the north bank of a small river and reinforced it with a large number of anti-tank guns to prevent the advance of German tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Soviet forces attacked the German trapezoidal position southwest of Sukhinichi on Sunday, deploying two tank brigades, several infantry divisions, and aircraft and artillery units. As a result, 74 tanks were destroyed by German artillery fire, and 14 aircraft were shot down by German aircraft. Finally, due to heavy losses, they quickly retreated. The German front line remained unmoved.</p>
<p>German Troops in the Orel Region Retake Lost Positions</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Responsible sources stated that the German defense line along the Oka River in the Orel region was breached by Soviet forces a few days ago. After a German counterattack, the lost positions were retaken, and over 800 enemy soldiers were killed. Northwest of Orel, the enemy launched a fierce attack with four infantry divisions, one brigade, and three tank brigades, supported by 200 artillery pieces, but failed due to fierce German resistance.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): There is a need to clarify the recent progress of the fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front. German forces withdrew from Gzhatsk and Sichevka according to plan, primarily to shorten the line. The current situation on the central front is different from the situation on the southern front in January of this year. At that time, German forces fighting in the Caucasus were forced to withdraw because strategy indicated that the area could not be held. However, today, German forces on the central front can still hold their positions if necessary. However, German commanders considered it unnecessary to defend, so they issued a withdrawal order. After this shortening of the front, German forces have some troops that can take on other activities. When German forces initially retreated this time, the enemy, after initial surprise and hesitation, began to send troops to attack in different directions. German forces withdrew safely. Soviet forces south of Lake Ilmen continue to launch large-scale attacks, suffering heavy losses and making little progress. Soviet forces north of Orel attempted to attack but were met with strong German resistance and failed. Enemy forces northwest of Kursk are pressing towards Novgorod and are still engaged in fierce fighting. In the Kharkov area, German forces launched a large-scale counterattack. Our elite troops are advancing along the Kharkov-Akhtyrka road. Soviet forces have built strong positions, and the German vanguard has reached the southern outskirts of the city. The main German force is 20 kilometers west of the city. Soviet attempts to encircle German positions in the Orel region have failed. The situation on the Donets and Mius fronts remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Well-informed sources in Berlin stated yesterday that Soviet forces suffered heavy losses of war material during the winter offensive, which even the largest military industries cannot easily replenish. During this period, Soviet forces lost an average of 150 armored vehicles per day. German military officials openly admitted that German estimates of Soviet military production capacity were incorrect. This error was due to the fact that very few figures were published on the military industries in Eastern Russia, the Urals, and Siberia. In addition, the Soviet Union has newly established several iron smelting furnaces and rolling mills in the Magnitogorsk and Chelyabinsk regions. However, this is not enough to maintain the Soviet offensive indefinitely. The Soviet Union has begun to use its own iron reserves, so after a considerable period of time, the Soviet Union will suffer from a shortage of steel.</p>
<h3>Tunisia: Heavy Fighting in the South; German Forces Occupy Several Positions; Preparing to Attack British Forces Again</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, 8th (Havas News Agency Telegram): There is nothing significant to report from the Tunisian front yesterday. In the northern sector of the Sejnane area, Axis forces made slight progress, but the fighting was limited to air force activity. In the central sector, there was only reconnaissance activity. In the southern sector, there was heavy fighting on the Mareth Line. The Allied side admitted that German forces occupied several positions in the Medenine area (west of Medenine) after heavy fighting. British forces used barrage fire to try to prevent the German advance, but Rommel's forces still broke through the British lines. There was also fierce fighting in the highlands north and northwest of Medenine. According to a radio broadcast from Algiers, General Rommel is now gathering tank units and infantry near Mareth, and is likely to launch another large-scale general offensive against British forces. West of the Mareth Line, near Tozeur and on the north bank of the Chott el Djerid, Axis forces also had contact with American forces. In addition, the Axis air force was also very active, shooting down a total of 21 British aircraft yesterday, 12 of which were shot down by Italian aircraft. When German aircraft bombed the port of Tripoli, they damaged two ships anchored in the port.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Military sources revealed that Axis armored patrols engaged in reconnaissance in southern Tunisia discovered that the main force of the British Eighth Army, consisting of two infantry divisions, two tank divisions, and one New Zealand division, had deployed positions in front of the Mareth Line. After the destruction of two American divisions, the enemy abandoned its original plan to encircle Rommel's troops. However, due to supply difficulties, the British Eighth Army shows no sign of an imminent offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Military sources revealed last night that German forces operating in Tunisia have been able to shorten their lines. Coastal troops occupied Cape Serrat and advanced westward, capturing an important section of mountainous terrain held by British forces. A key road of the enemy is now under German control. German forces in the area captured two enemy tanks, twelve armored vehicles, five anti-tank guns, thirteen anti-aircraft guns, thirty-eight motorcycles, captured many enemy soldiers, and seized a radio station. The German advance, after encircling the enemy's rear, caught the enemy by surprise, resulting in heavy losses.</p>
<h3>German and British Air Forces Bomb Each Other</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Authoritative sources here officially stated today that British aircraft raided southern Germany last night, causing significant damage to residential areas and casualties among civilians. Eight enemy aircraft were shot down by us.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency Telegram): Responsible sources announced that enemy aircraft flew over the occupied areas of Western Europe yesterday and, within ninety minutes, six were shot down by our forces, including several four-engine bombers. It was not revealed whether the enemy aircraft were British or American.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 8th (Havas News Agency Telegram): The air forces of the belligerent countries continued to be active over Europe yesterday. German aircraft attacked the southern coast of England, dropping many incendiary and explosive bombs, causing severe damage to some factories. The British Air Force bombed the German city of Lingen in the northwest and the French towns of Orléans and Cognac. American aircraft also bombed Rouen and Rennes. An official British communiqué announced that a short naval battle took place near the British coast at dawn yesterday, and one British vessel was sunk.</p>
<h3>Overview of Important Japanese Industries (3)</h3>
<p>Coal Industry</p>
<p>Coal is the source of heat and power for various industries and transportation sectors. It is not only an indispensable basic resource but also a raw material for the chemical industry, making it extremely important. In terms of the need for military supplies, and secondarily in the chemical industry and other first-line businesses such as railways, electricity, gas, and coke production, coal occupies the first place in heavy industry. Increasing coal production and ensuring its smooth distribution is currently the most urgent task. Since the China Incident, its need has increased significantly.</p>
<p>Due to the surge in wartime coal demand, there has also been a rapid increase in production. The output in Showa 11 (1936) was 47.9 million kilograms (41.8 million in Japan, 2.28 million in Korea, 2.08 million in Karafuto, and 1.74 million in Taiwan). In Manchuria and North China, the increase in output has also been very rapid in recent years. Coal reserves are very abundant throughout the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The main ones in Japan are in the Kyushu region, where the coalfields of Chikuhō, Miike, and Karatsu are of excellent quality, mostly coking coal. These, combined with part of the coalfields, account for about 80% of Japan's coal production. Secondly, Hokkaido is also very promising in the future, and the coal quality is also good. The Ishikari coalfield is the largest. The Jōban coalfield in the Hirakata area of Fukushima Prefecture mostly produces lignite. Because it is close to consumption areas, it is worthy of attention from a transportation perspective. The coal output of Manchuria in Showa 11 (1936) was 12 million kilograms, a figure that has increased very rapidly in recent years. Major coal mines include the South Manchuria Railway's Fushun, Yantai, Wafangdian, Wenhe, and Laotougou; the Manchuria Coal Mining Company's Fuxin, Beipiao, Xī'an, Hegang, Mishan, etc.; and others such as Benxi Lake and Bubian Dao. North China is the world's largest coal resource area, and the coal quality is also excellent. Major coal mines include the recently demilitarized Zhongxing, Cixian, Dawenkou, Yangquan, and Jingxing, Datong, and Kailuan. In other areas, examples include the Huainan Coal Mine in Central China, and the high-quality Hong Gai coalfield in Vietnam, and the anthracite coalfields of Cambodia and Courbet. In the current decisive battle period, due to ship transportation issues, special attention can only be paid to Kyushu coal, Yamaguchi coal, Jōban coal, and Hokkaido coal, which is used for raw materials and gas generators.</p>
<p>The main Japanese coal mining companies are Mitsui Mining and Mitsubishi Mining, two major companies in the Kyushu and Yamaguchi main industry areas. Others include Beishō Coal Mine, Meiji Mining, Sumitomo Mining, Nippon Steel Mining, Nissan Chemical Industries, Furukawa Mining, Jibu Kōsan, Asō Mining, Tōhō Coal Mine, Tōmihatsu Coal Mine, Kijima Coal Mine, Taisho Mining, and Kaho Mining Department. In Hokkaido and Jōban, there are the three major companies of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Hokkaido Coal Mining. Others include Yūbetsu Coal Mine, Taiheiyo Coal Mining, Iwaki Coal Mining, Shōwa Denkō, and Dai Nippon Coal Mining.</p>
<p>The above 22 companies are individual members of the Coal Control Association. In addition, there are many small and medium-sized coal mine operators. The country is divided into seven coal control associations, with the most in Kyushu. The business performance of these large and small coal mining companies has been affected by increased production costs due to increases in wages, materials, and operating expenses. Taking the latter half of Showa 13 (1938) as a standard, there has been a gradual downward trend since then. The actual situation in Showa 17 (1942) is that some companies have profits, while others have deficits. In general, the cost per ton has deteriorated somewhat compared to a while ago.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the low-price policy, coal prices have been suppressed since Showa 13 (1938). The government has adopted a price compensation system to compensate for the deteriorating cost of mining.</p>
<p>Coal sales are now concentrated in the Japan Coal Company. When buying coal from mining operators, compensation is given to each mining operator for the necessary production costs and reasonable profits to increase production. The price is determined by considering the quality and business efficiency. On the other hand, when selling this purchased coal, the purchase price, transportation costs, and other factors are comprehensively calculated, and a reasonable and appropriate price is set according to the quality. To avoid passing on the increased value at the time of purchase to the consumer, the losses incurred by the company are compensated by the government's purchase price compensation.</p>
<p>This expense was over 20.63 million yen in Showa 15 (1940). Since then, due to the continuous rise in production costs, it has increased year by year, and in Showa 18 (1943), it is expected to reach as much as 316.9 million yen to guarantee the appropriate profits of coal mining operators.</p>
<p>The decisive battle system of the coal business is developing under the guidance of the Coal Department of the Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, with the Coal Control Association as the center. It unifies coal mining operators nationwide and integrates them with the government, and its responsibility is extremely important. The chairman is Mr. Matsumoto Kenjirō, former president of Meiji Industries, who also serves as president of the Japan Coal Company in order to establish close contact with the coal distribution department. The director-general is Mr. Uemura Kōgorō, former vice president of the Planning Board. Experienced individuals from major coal mining companies serve as directors and department heads of the secretariat. The production expansion plan, supply and demand plan, and liaison and investigation with control agencies in foreign countries, or enterprise reorganization and integration plans, are carried out by the production, labor, materials, distribution, and management departments.</p>
<p>When a production plan is set and implemented, the actual situation of each company is grasped, and the proportion of production that each company should produce is determined. Each company is obligated to the specified production volume in order to thoroughly control production. As for labor measures, the labor department cooperates with the labor mobilization plan implemented by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, dividing workers into general adult males, Korean laborers, and the Labor Service Corps, and appropriately allocating them to each coal mine according to their production efficiency. In addition, food and daily necessities for coal mine materials and laborers, totaling 178 items, are centrally controlled by the materials department to ensure their distribution.</p>
<p>Regarding coal distribution, Mr. Nii Kōichi, the distribution manager of the Japan Coal Company, also serves as the distribution manager of the Control Association, setting the distribution plan and guiding and controlling the transportation and loading and unloading of coal. Under the unified control of the Japan Coal Company, designated brokerage groups and retail groups implement joint purchase and joint sales.</p>
<p>Thanks to the cooperation of the government and the private sector, overcoming the shortage of labor and materials and the adverse conditions of increased production costs, excellent results have been produced. At the same time, production is being intensified, and the target is being broken through to enhance coal production in the current decisive battle situation. The reorganization and integration of coal mining areas is also one of the realistic issues. Under the limited relationship of production factors such as materials, labor funds, and ship transportation, the government promulgated wartime administrative authority special exceptions and wartime administrative special exception laws, correcting the original bureaucratic sectionalism, opening up the bottleneck for production enhancement, and fully implementing production concentration from the perspectives of region, coal quality, and coal mine management efficiency.</p>
<p>The reorganization and integration of coal mines has been a long-standing issue. Because of the conflicting interests of each company, there is no sign of breaking the deadlock today. The planning department of the Coal Control Association has been investigating and planning the issue of reorganization and integration of each coal mine and complex mining area since its establishment. In order to adapt to the current situation, the government will implement the integration of each coal mine and provide reorganization subsidies after Showa 18 (1943). The rational integration of major coal mining companies is a problem, but the biggest problem is how to reorganize and integrate the more than 700 small and medium-sized coal mining companies.</p>
<p>The reorganization and integration of coal mines has been repeatedly explained by Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi and government committee members in this session of the Diet. For coal mines with good production efficiency and prospects, efforts will be made to increase production with limited materials and labor, aiming at the rational concentration of production in each coal mine. When reorganizing, in addition to the excellence of efficiency and the future of the coal pit, special attention is paid to special coal such as raw material coal and gas coal and general coal. In addition, in terms of the ship transportation issue, coal pits that are far from consumption areas are reorganized before those that are closer. How to quickly and smoothly resolve the above problems is the key to increasing coal production in Japan in the future, and it is also the key to enhancing Japan's military strength.

<h3>Night Bombing of Guadalcanal Island: Bombs Rain Down Under the Moonlight, Enemy Anti-Aircraft Guns Roar in Vain</h3>
<p>(Report from the Naval Reporting Unit at OO Base Highlands) That night, half of Guadalcanal Island was covered by clouds. In the dim moonlight, the Lunga River lay horizontally, reflecting a faint glimmer. – On the 00th of 0th month, the Japanese Naval Air Force, from sunset to sunrise the next day 00th, divided into 0 groups, continuously bombed Guadalcanal Island. The enemy air force stronghold was bombarded throughout the night, and bombs rained down, severely destroying all facilities, causing the enemy's heart to tremble. Moreover, this night raid overcame the difficulty of long-distance night flight, and was a courageous attack made amidst the enemy's intense defensive gunfire and anti-aircraft illumination. This time, the reporter accompanied the attack team led by Lieutenant OO and had the opportunity to witness their courageous night attack.</p>
<p>Attack Aircraft Enter the Island Silhouette</p>
<p>"Hey! Let's take a good look!" Chief OO encouraged me in this way. I replied with a smile and became a passenger on the plane. The young crew members kindly brought me a flight suit, saying, "It's very cold at night..." In the area near the equator, wearing a woolen undershirt was already very hot, and adding a flight suit made my body feel like I was in a steam room, hot and sweaty all over. However, after leaving the base and arriving among the clouds to view the moon, the heat seemed to have been blown away somewhere, and I already felt very cold. Flying at an altitude of 00 meters, the attack aircraft skillfully avoided the clouds ahead and proceeded smoothly over the Solomon Sea. Looking down occasionally, between the white clouds, I could see the sea surface reflecting golden light. Above that sea surface, there were clear and distinct black shadows scattered everywhere. I thought these black shadows were probably the silhouettes of islands, so I watched intently, but who knew they were all cloud shadows reflected by the moonlight. Dark clouds were stacked on the right side of the plane, making the sky look ominous. Lightning flashed from time to time in the air.</p>
<p>"The weather is the enemy of night flying," this thought flashed through my mind in an instant. Now, a large cloud peak appeared on the left, towering abruptly, its surface bathed in light, appearing milky white, while the reverse side was dark gray. Looking down from the top of this cloud peak, the sea reflecting the water light below was as quiet as the surface of a lake. The moonlight shone into the cockpit, illuminating the driver's upper body in a bluish-white light. On the instrument panel in front, many numbers and the phosphorescence of the pointers floated. The telegraph operator in the rear leaned on the dim light, desperately pressing the telegraph key, and on the telegraph machine hung two dolls, one Japanese and one foreign, which were probably mascots given in the comfort bag. A small piece of paper was transferred from the telegraph seat to Lieutenant OO, which was a telegram from the 0th bombing team, reporting that the weather over the enemy ground was suitable for bombing.</p>
<p>The plane passed through the 0 side of OO Island more and more smoothly. The cold became more and more severe, and my hands were about to freeze, so I had to put them in my pockets and endure it for the time being. However, the crew member came from behind and patted my shoulder, lending me a pair of leather gloves. All the crew members put on oxygen masks at this time because they were approaching the enemy's camp. At this time, I could already see several dim islands of various sizes. I didn't have a map with me, so I couldn't identify which one was which island. I only knew that the plane was flying closer to its target, Guadalcanal Island, so I clenched my hands tightly. After the plane turned to the left side of a large cumulonimbus cloud, it began to make several turns. The cloud line tilted to the right for a while and to the left for a while. Before long, I saw the black silhouette of an island, and I arbitrarily determined that that island must be Guadalcanal Island, so I stared at the island intently. At this moment, the roar of the engine seemed to be getting louder, and the attack aircraft I was on had adopted a considerable speed and flew towards the island silhouette.</p>
<p>Searchlights Illuminating the Night Sky</p>
<p>"Hey! Guadalcanal has arrived!" I muttered to myself while sticking my head out to look down. I remembered that there was a mountain about two thousand meters high in the middle of Guadalcanal Island, which was its characteristic, but what I saw at this time was just a black island. Its appearance was completely different from what I expected. I don't know if this was because my night vision couldn't see the height of the land clearly, or because of the height of the plane. I couldn't regard anything as a target. At this time, the plane crossed the coastline from one side of the island, and I thought it was advancing towards the enemy's airfield, the target of the attack. Suddenly, two or three beams of searchlight light were released from the dark ground, and their intensity was dozens of times brighter than the bluish-white moonlight. The slender light rods moved back and forth incessantly towards the night sky. At this time, I secretly prayed in my heart, "I hope I don't get illuminated." At this moment, four or five blood-red fireballs flew and burst open on the lower right of the aircraft nose. The color was like red-hot iron, slightly yellow in the red, and that was the enemy's high-angle artillery shells. "Huh! Here they come!" Feeling this way, I stared at those fireballs, and the number of searchlights on the ground had increased to about ten. The light beams gradually approached the plane. One of them seemed to graze the right wing. In that instant, two, three beams of light had converged on the plane. The maintenance crew member on board pointed downwards at me, as if to tell me something. I looked down and saw that the small square window at the bottom of the plane was as bright and dazzling as if it were illuminated by an arc lamp. This time, high-angle artillery shells burst open directly in front of the left side of the aircraft nose. When it exploded, it was fiery red, and later turned into black smoke, which could be clearly seen in the moonlight. In addition to the light of the searchlights on the ground, flashes of light that suddenly lit up and disappeared could be seen everywhere, which was probably the firing light of the high-angle artillery shells. The impact of the shells that exploded nearby even shook the airframe. At this time, the plane quickly turned to the right again, avoiding the light.</p>
<p>The light beams stubbornly raced and shone back and forth in the sky, but the plane flew out of the illuminated field and then leisurely circled, re-aiming at the enemy's target. The western third of Guadalcanal Island was under white clouds, but the target of the attack was not covered by the clouds. After a while, the plane flew over the enemy's sky again from the 0 side. For some reason, the enemy's searchlights were not as nervous as before this time. Only one place was emitting light, and the light was completely shining in the opposite direction, which was an excellent opportunity. At this time, the airfield was clearly revealed on the ground, so bang, bang, bang, the sound of bombs exploding resonated delightfully in the plane. This time it was our bombs being delivered to the enemy's heads. I stretched my neck to see the situation when the bombs hit, but regrettably, I couldn't see clearly from where I was sitting. The plane flew near the coastline and was illuminated by searchlights again, but the plane still skillfully avoided its illumination. After completing the aerial suppression of the scheduled time, we had to hand over the task to the 0th attack team, so our squadron flew back to the base under the bright moonlight. It was 0:00 at this time. Because I was very excited, I didn't feel sleepy at all. On the way back, the crew members took out canned food as a midnight snack. When I returned to the base, I immediately took out a cigarette and smoked it madly. (Translated by Ding from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, March 4)</p>
<h3>Java Pacification Anniversary: Celebration Held, Residents Launch Mass Movement, Cooperating with Allied Nations to Complete the War</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 9th (Central News Agency) Residents in various parts of Java, to commemorate the first anniversary of the Japanese army's pacification of Java, have started holding celebrations since the 1st. The special city of Jakarta held a grand central celebration meeting for the first anniversary of the pacification of Java at Kampier Square at 9:30 this morning. Attendees included the highest commander of the Japanese army, the military administration department, various units of the Japanese army, important military and political figures, Chinese and Japanese residents, indigenous people, Arab Muslims, and tens of thousands of others. First, General Affairs Minister Nakayama, the chairman of the conference, delivered the opening speech, followed by a congratulatory speech by the highest commander of the Japanese army. Representatives of overseas Chinese and indigenous people also delivered congratulatory speeches separately, and the atmosphere was very warm. At noon, the Japanese army held a grand exercise in the square, and the military band also held an outdoor performance.</p>
<p>Jakarta, 9th (Central News Agency) Since the implementation of military administration in Java, the construction situation has completed various basic tasks in the past year. Now, to accommodate the wishes of indigenous leaders, the military administration department is preparing to officially construct a Mass Integrated Strength Movement, starting on the anniversary of the Java Pacification on the 9th. Its outline was announced yesterday. The purpose of this movement is to cooperate with Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War and to smoothly implement military administration to build a strong new Java. The organization decided to set up a central affairs bureau in Jakarta as the central agency, and set up local branches in seventeen states and thirty-two Hou territories on the island, and then set up branch offices in counties and districts as subordinate organizations. Furthermore, this movement is completely different from the political movement practiced in Java before the war. It is a mass life practice movement for the entire island with the aim of building a new Java and making it a new component of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it does not adopt a liberal membership organization, but is based on the entire indigenous people of Java. The main staff of the Central Affairs Bureau were appointed on the 9th, with Hatta, the former leader of the Java Mass Movement, as the director of the Central Affairs Bureau and the director of the Central Organization Department, Taiwindaro, the former chairman of the Education Federation, as the minister of Central Education, Sukarno, the former leader of the Mass Movement, as the minister of Central Propaganda, and Monsour, the former chairman of the Java Muslim League, as the minister of Central Social Organization.</p>
<h3>Bhamo Governor Delivers a Speech on Aspirations for Building a Nation in Burma: Eliminating Past Nationalism and Individualism to Form a Link in the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) During the Greater East Asia War, Burma cooperated with the Japanese army to drive out British forces. Afterwards, although the enemy used various schemes, propaganda, and alienation, the cooperation between Japan and Burma remained unshaken, and they devoted all their efforts to establishing security and promoting construction projects, all of which have achieved remarkable results. The Japanese government previously stated that it would allow Burma to build a nation this year, which has made the Burmese deeply grateful. All of the new system cases that will be born this year are the basis for building a nation in Burma. Because Burma was bound by the constitution formulated by the British, everything must be redefined from the beginning. After the establishment of Burma, it will become an important part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. How to operate its politics must also be carefully considered. Governor Bhamo once said on this point, "We, with the qualifications of bearing heavy responsibilities, must grasp this great opportunity given by Japan and move forward with the momentum of building and promoting the development of Burma. Its future success or failure depends on our ability and efforts. Burma has been imprisoned by the British in the past, resulting in it becoming a laggard in the times for nearly a hundred years. Now, establishing a national system and becoming a member of the East Asian countries, its ability to achieve sound development is tied to the ruling body." Dr. Bhamo's words are sufficient to express the heavy responsibilities of the Burmese politicians and the important tasks after the formation of Burma, which will be to seek the unification and solidarity of all Burmese politics. All Burmese are born in Burma. After falling to the British, they lost the meaning of believing in religion due to British aggression. At the same time, it made the Burmese fight each other for power. The British tightly grasped Burma to plunder resources. This kind of cunning scheme of dividing power to weaken economic power has made the Burmese attach themselves to it for many years. In the past twenty years, although incidents such as the Karen Rebellion have occurred, the Burmese have enthusiastically promoted the independence movement, but the British still used cunning schemes to exploit the two opposing people in Burma at that time. With this scheme, Burmese politicians only knew how to engage in party struggles, while they reaped the benefits. This is indeed one of the problems in Burma. Although all parties are aware of this, they have been exhausted by competition and have little time to consider the planning that Burma should have after gaining independence in the future. Burmese also have major shortcomings in the economic aspect, that is, a lack of economic administrative ability. Although the Burmese were bound by British policies in the political aspect in the past, except for the Shan Department and other areas directly under the Governor-General, about two-thirds of Burma still implemented central and local administration in the name of the Burmese government. On certain political issues, they still argued with the British, but in terms of economic administration, the British controlled the actual power, causing the Burmese to appear backward in the economic aspect and lack economic creativity and implementation capabilities. However, economic construction is the urgent task to which the nation-building capabilities of any country are tied. Since British forces were driven out of Burma, Burmese economic activity movements have been carried out on a small scale. However, the Burmese for the Burmese that is touted seems to carry a nationalistic character and neglect the rights and interests of overseas Chinese and Indians. In fact, this is not the case. The status and tasks undertaken by Indians in the Burmese economy are also very important. If they withdraw from Burma, it will have a significant impact on Burmese economic construction, and this move will not benefit Burma at all. The upper class Burmese also have a considerable understanding of this, so Indian-Burmese economic cooperation is a realistic issue, which is necessary for the national economic lives of both parties. After the establishment of Burma, what is the basic concept of its mission in the Greater East Asia Economic Sphere? Regarding this point, Dr. Bhamo once said that Burma is a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so it must eliminate past nationalism and individualism, and make the greatest efforts as a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Based on the concept of true mutual assistance, sharing life and death, and fully cooperating with the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in politics and economics.</p>

<h3>Southwest Pacific Theater: Japanese Army Holds the Initiative; Germans Admire the Outstanding War Achievements of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from London, Reuters' special correspondent on the New Guinea front admitted that the Japanese army still holds the upper hand in the Southwest Pacific. He expressed his opinion, saying that the initiative in the Southwest Pacific operations is still in the hands of the Japanese army. The Japanese army has deployed army units in all important locations for operations in this area, and the air force is also superior to the anti-Axis side. Commander McWorthley must defend Australia and its nearby islands with weak forces, so his position is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Haitong News Agency) German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer stated in a broadcast in Tokyo that the German people admire the outstanding war achievements of the Japanese army in the past fifteen months. The German people are also proud of the determination of their ally Japan to fight. The war aims of Germany and Japan are the same, and the Tripartite Pact not only guarantees to start and end the war together, but will also maintain the long-term peace of the world. Germany knows that the combat power of the German and Japanese armies is extremely strong and will be able to complete their current major tasks.</p>

<h3>Turkish Parliament Unanimously Elects Ismet as President: National Assembly Scheduled to Convene Mid-Month</h3>

<h3>U.S. Vice President Declares a Third World War Is Inevitable; Lack of Contact Between the Soviet Union and the Allied Powers is a Factor in This Fact</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Havas News Agency) According to news from New York, U.S. Vice President Wallace delivered a speech yesterday, saying that the world may face a third world war, and said that this war is mostly caused by the lack of close contact between the Soviet Union and the Allied powers. He said, "Although we Americans follow a constructive path, a third world war may still be caused by the actions of other countries. This is of course the case. For example, if the Soviet Union continues to hold the ideas of Trotsky's world revolution, or if the British side continues to sympathize with the anti-Soviet activities of Germany and other countries, then war is inevitable. In addition, if we repeat the mistakes after the First World War, it will also constitute the cause of the Third World War. At that time, creditor countries raised their tariffs and demanded that foreign countries repay their debts without allowing them to export. This action is enough to cause a trade war and eventually lead to bloodshed."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) U.S. Vice President Wallace declared yesterday at the Deleville Conference that if Britain and the United States cannot reach a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet Union before the war, then a third world war seems difficult to avoid. If the United States and the Soviet Union cannot trust each other and reach an understanding, then Germany and the Soviet Union may join hands sooner or later. If the United States wants to prevent communists from carrying out propaganda and instigation activities in the United States, then it must increase production and ensure that everyone has work to do. It is better to be prepared for a third world war. Even if people take a step, for example, the Soviet Union continues its attempt to promote world revolution, and the British sympathize with anti-Soviet tendencies, if one of them comes true, a third world war will be difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>"Prontosil" 10th Anniversary: In the week of February 2nd, the 10th anniversary of the invention of "Prontosil" by German medical luminaries Domic, Nielzsch, and Klarer was celebrated. Since the invention of "Prontosil," many sulfonamide preparations have been produced. Therefore, at present, 90% of white turbidity diseases can be completely cured with this product, and the mortality rate of pneumonia has also been reduced to 5%, and the cure rate of meningitis has also been changed to 90%. This kind of rapid progress in modern treatment is all due to the epoch-making inventions of German medical luminaries. The importance of "Prontosil" and sulfonamide preparations in this world war is even greater. All wounds and infectious diseases that could not be treated during the last world war can now be completely cured with this product. (Guang)</p>

<h3>29th Ration of Food Already Collected: White Rice More Than Brown Rice, Some Rice Shops Collect Complete White Rice, No. 2 and No. 3 Flour Sold Together</h3>
<p>The twenty-eighth period of household rice sold by rice shops in the two concessions ended yesterday. Sales are suspended today to settle accounts. According to the reporter's inquiry, the twenty-ninth period of rations collected by the rice shops in the two concessions has more white rice than brown rice. Some rice shops in the French Concession collected complete white rice. Because broken rice has been promoted, the flour in the twenty-ninth period is divided into two types of combinations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Flour Divided into Two Types of Combinations</p>
<p>According to the reporter's accurate information from the Public Works Bureau's Materials Control Office, the twenty-ninth period of household rice has been scheduled to go on sale from tomorrow, counting one and a half liters of white rice or brown rice, plus one liter of broken rice, selling for 6.3 yuan in reserve notes. One and a half jin of flour, selling for 3.85 yuan in reserve notes. However, there is more white rice than brown rice in this period of whole rice. There are two types of flour, No. 2 and No. 3, combined with one and a half jin of No. 2 and four liang of No. 3.</p>
<p>Purchase Certificates Already Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Materials Control Office and various rice purchase certificate distribution offices first issued rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates from the 22nd of last month. Starting from the 1st of this month, oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates were added. It was completed yesterday. Today, the various offices are dedicated to issuing rice tickets for the rickshaw pullers. On the 11th, they will handle the re-issuance of oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates that have been obtained from the Racecourse, and on the 12th, those who have obtained rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates from other offices will be re-issued oil purchase certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates.</p>
<p>Sales Period for Miscellaneous Grains and Edible Oil Undetermined</p>
<p>According to the reporter's inquiry, the quality of miscellaneous grains is roughly beans. It has not been determined whether the sales date will be purchased with the 30th period of household rice sold by the rice shops. The Materials Control Office has not heard of the rumors of sales on the 21st. It can only be determined when the Public Works Bureau publishes its bulletins. The date of edible oil collection has not been determined because, to date, the edible oil wholesale office has not allocated edible oil to other oil shops. Finally, according to the reporter's inquiry, the edible oil issued for the first time is bean oil. Most of this bean oil is pressed by the seven oil mills in this port.</p>
<p>Rice for Rickshaw Pullers Approved by the Authorities</p>
<p>The Special Zone Rickshaw Owners Association, because the household rice rations for rickshaw pullers were insufficient, sent representatives to the Public Works Bureau to request the issuance of extra rice. The case has been approved and registered by the Public Works Bureau. Each rickshaw puller is issued "extra rice" of two liters per period, starting today, with a deadline of three days, ending on the 13th. Each rickshaw owner can first fill out a request form at the Special Zone Association at 81 Lloyd Road, relying on the rickshaw puller's driving license (i.e., small photo card), the rickshaw owner's certificate, and the seal, and submit it to the place designated by the Public Works Bureau to receive the rice purchase certificate. However, each rickshaw owner must pay close attention to the rice purchase certificate, which must be transferred to each registered rickshaw puller in full, and no fraudulent incidents may occur, otherwise severe penalties will be imposed.</p>
<p>Request Notice</p>
<p>The request form they fill out is issued by the Materials Control Department Allocation Office of the Public Works Bureau. The period, rickshaw puller's name, certificate number, number of rickshaws, and the number of extra allocated rice purchase certificates must be filled out on the form, and the registration number of the rickshaw puller must be recorded in detail on the back of the application form.</p>

<p>At the same time, it is printed on the application form that the association and the rickshaw owner guarantee, "We, the rickshaw owner and the association, are willing to guarantee that the above-mentioned rice purchase certificates will be issued to the rickshaw pullers. Otherwise, we will return them immediately. If the Public Works Bureau finds that the terms of this guarantee or the facts reported in this application are false or inaccurate, the Public Works Bureau may revoke the rickshaw owner's license or deal with it in other ways." The signature and seal are below.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Premier's Death Anniversary: Baojia Youth Corps Drill - Detailed Program Largely Finalized - Propaganda to be Conducted by Teams After Parade</h3>
<p>According to sources speaking to a "Times" newspaper reporter, this Friday is the anniversary of the Premier's death. The Public Concession Baojia Youth Corps will gather at the Racecourse for a special training drill. The program has largely been finalized.</p>
<p>Overnight Camping at the Racecourse</p>
<p>It is said that Police Commissioner Watanabe was not, as previously reported, scheduled to inspect the Civilian Self-Defense Corps on Friday. The Baojia Youth Division's drill program includes overnight camping at the Racecourse on Thursday. They will gather at 7:30 PM on Thursday, then practice various routines. Finally, Baojia leaders will give a brief history of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution.</p>
<p>Ceremony to be Held on the Morning of the Anniversary</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM on the 12th, the campers will hold drills. At 9:00 AM, a memorial service for the Premier will be held, including raising the flag and bowing three times to a portrait of the Premier, followed by five minutes of silence.

Baojia personnel from all districts will participate.</p>
<p>Propaganda to be Conducted by Teams After Parade</p>
<p>The parade route will proceed from Avenue Edward VII via Rue Chapsal (now Jinling East Road) and Fuzhou Road, then to the Bund, before turning back to Nanjing Road and Bubbling Well Road (now Nanjing West Road), ending at Hardoon Garden (now the Shanghai Exhibition Center).

<h3>Shanghai West Baojia Association to Hold Regular Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Baojia Committee, in order to discuss Baojia work within the district and strengthen the Baojia forces, has scheduled a full committee meeting to be held at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month at the association's head office.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Police Chief Pan Da Talks About Reforming the Shanghai West Police System - Abolishing Branch Bureaus and Police Stations to Centralize Administrative Institutions - Increasing On-Duty Officers to Promote Police Efficiency</h3>
<p>The "Times" reports that Shanghai West Police Chief Pan Da spoke to reporters yesterday, saying that he intends to reorganize the Shanghai West police, abolishing the sub-bureau, branch bureau, and police station systems, and centralizing police administration. The current system is not as effective as expected, so the branch bureau system must be abolished, and the entire concession divided into several districts, each with a district bureau, which will report directly to the central bureau.</p>
<p>Scattered Strength Insufficient</p>
<p>Chief Pan explained that the Shanghai West police force is currently divided into twenty units, including sub-bureaus, branch bureaus, and police stations, with a total of 523 personnel. Therefore, each unit has 27 personnel. Divided into three shifts per day, each shift has only nine on-duty officers. With such a small number, it is difficult to handle patrol, special tasks, and emergency cases such as closures and fires. This leads to inefficiency, and sometimes only one person is responsible for the duties of each unit, causing many difficulties and resulting in results that are not as satisfactory as expected. Chief Pan also stated that if branch bureaus and police stations are abolished, leaving only four sub-bureaus, the police force that can be dispatched at any time can be greatly increased. In theory, each sub-bureau can have 130 personnel, with 43 on each shift. This new system can also free up 139 personnel from the total number to perform more important tasks. In other words, police efficiency will increase by 26 percent.</p>
<p>Distance Between Sub-Bureaus and Their Boundaries</p>
<p>When asked whether the sub-bureaus would be able to independently handle police affairs within their jurisdictions after the abolition of branch bureaus and police stations, Chief Pan replied that the furthest point in each sub-bureau's jurisdiction is only about one kilometer (two li) from the sub-bureau, measured from the center. This distance can be reached in ten minutes on foot or three minutes by bicycle. In fact, the walking time required for each sub-bureau to reach the boundary of its jurisdiction is as follows: (1) First Sub-Bureau, Labour Lane, 1.5 kilometers, 15 minutes; (2) Second Sub-Bureau, Great Western Road (now Yan'an West Road), 1.75 kilometers, 17 minutes; (3) Third Sub-Bureau, Route Tenant de Tourville (now Xiangyang North Road), 1.25 kilometers, 12 minutes; (4) Fourth Sub-Bureau, Hongqiao Road, 2.25 kilometers, 22 minutes. The Fourth Sub-Bureau will soon be moved to a more suitable location. In addition, telephones for direct communication with the central bureau will be added, and the number of on-duty personnel is expected to increase. If the above plan is approved, the security of Shanghai West will be greatly improved.</p>
<h3>Sixth Phase of Grain Distribution in Nanshi - 2.5 Sheng of Brown Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West rice shortage is delayed; Nanshi's sixth phase of grain distribution has been ordered by the Food Administration Bureau to be carried out by the district's public distribution offices, and the procedures have been completed. Public distribution began yesterday, with each person's ration increased to 2.5 sheng per ten-day period, priced at six yuan and three jiao. It is said that this time it is all brown rice. However, the Shanghai West district is short 4,000 bags of rice, so there is not enough to distribute, and it has been temporarily delayed. Once the rice arrives, the district will begin distribution quickly.</p>
<h3>Food Control Committee Reorganized as the Ministry of Food - Rice Purchase and Transport Permits Still Valid - Original Passports Extended for One Month - Renamed and Issued from March 1st</h3>
<p>The Food Control Committee has been reorganized as the Ministry of Food, and was officially established on the first day of last month. All rice purchase certificates and transport passports should be uniformly changed to use the names of the Ministry of Food and the Minister. However, there are still many of these certificates and passports that were previously distributed by the Committee to district offices and food administration bureaus in various provinces and cities for storage and use. At the beginning of this reorganization, reprinting, distributing, and applying them would be too time-consuming. The issuance of certificates and passports cannot be stopped even for a day. According to reports from our newspaper, the Ministry has decided to extend the use of the original certificates and passports bearing the names of the Food Control Committee and the Chairman for one month. All certificates and passports that can be issued before the end of February of this year will remain valid. From March 1st, certificates and passports will be issued bearing the name of the Minister of Food. The Ministry has already issued orders to its offices and food administration bureaus in various provinces and cities to inform relevant agencies, and has also sent a letter to the Municipal Government to inform its subordinate agencies.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Collect Taxes on Superstitious Items - Two Concessions Surveyed in Sections - Nanshi and Shanghai West Surveys Completed</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Nanping, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's preparatory office for collecting taxes on superstitious business articles, after being commissioned by the Bureau to be responsible for the preparatory work for collecting superstitious taxes in the city, established the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau's Preparatory Office for the Collection of Taxes on Superstitious Business Articles on Great Western Road (now Yan'an West Road) on March 1st to begin work. The office is conducting a preliminary survey of the types and amounts of various superstitious items in the city. In addition to submitting reports separately, the office will also publish announcements to inform the public. According to reporters inquiring at the survey division of the office, the survey work in Nanshi and Shanghai West has been completed. At the same time, the first and second special districts have each been divided into eight sections, with one person assigned to each section to be responsible for carrying out the survey work. It is expected that the survey will be completed by mid-March, and a notice will be issued to inform all relevant businesses dealing in superstitious items in the city to go to the office to register and complete tax payment procedures in accordance with regulations. It is also learned that the incense and candle shops in Shanghai West and the first and second special districts, reported by the industry association to the preparatory office, number about 60.</p>
<h3>Cultivating Youth's Enthusiasm for Helping Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received donations to student aid funds from various sectors, including doctors with a compassionate heart, people from cultural, academic, and business circles, contributing from candle offerings, donating from lost and found items, or generously helping students, all of which are worthy models for society. The donations received yesterday include: Doctor Cai Guangcan, 1,000 yuan; second-hand bookstore colleagues, 280 yuan (Chen Yunqing, Li Yixin, Wang Yuanqi, and Zhuang Wenxi, 50 yuan each; Chuan Zhangrong and Le Lingzhou, 15 yuan each; Wang Manqing, Zhong Hanguang, Hua Shangzhi, Huang Jingquan, and Zhou Zhiwei, 10 yuan each); all students of the Agronomy Department of Nantong College, 200 yuan (candle offerings in memory of classmates Chen Weizun and Que Deyi); Wang Min (selling a found fountain pen), 150 yuan; Yang Yongtao, Lu Hongyu, and Tang Tongfu, 100 yuan each; Guo Binghui and Ren Lianggeng, 50 yuan each; Pu Jiting (in memory of his late teacher Hua Xingcun), 20 yuan; Little Sister Zhu Xilian, 10 yuan. The total amount received is 2,060 yuan in reserve currency, with a balance of 241,230 yuan and 5 jiao and 9 fen.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Residential Certificates to be Completed by the End of June - Extended for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has been issuing residential certificates to people in various districts of the city since August 12th of last year. Six months have now passed. Previously, the Ministry of Interior instructed that the issuance of residential certificates by police agencies at all levels in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai be extended until the end of March of this year. However, the issuance of residential certificates in various districts of the city was delayed, and it is feared that it will be difficult to complete by the end of March as scheduled. Therefore, the bureau has ordered all district police bureaus to comply, and the residential certificates are allowed to be extended until the end of June. It is essential to promptly encourage people to universally apply for and receive them.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Shanghai British and American Prisoner of War Camp</h3>
<p>— Liu Hanruo</p>
<p>(1) Prelude</p>
<p>It is the first day of the third month of the war. Although spring has arrived in Jiangnan, the early morning is still quite chilly.</p>
<p>The reporter group, consisting of more than fifty people, includes reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers in the Shanghai area, as well as reporters from various Western newspapers. Colleagues from Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou line, Hong Kong in South China, Yangzhou north of the Yangtze River, and Wuhu and Bengbu in Anhui Province have also come from afar to participate. This is a major gathering of journalists in Central China after the war. In order to inspect our common enemies, we join hands and take a week to tour the British and American prisoner of war camp.</p>
<p>Two large cars, carrying our group, temporarily drove out of this bustling city. A wave of green wheat emerges in the fields, allowing people to smell the breath of early spring. Three or five farmers, holding hoes, are cultivating in the slightly warm sunlight, their postures leisurely. Travelers carrying bags and baskets along the road watch the vehicles flying back and forth. On the land of Jiangnan, besides the broken walls and ruins, no traces of artillery fire can be found. It has been revived!</p>
<p>After a journey of about thirty minutes, we reached our destination. Leaving the car, on the left side of the guard post, a wooden sign hangs, reading "Shanghai Prisoner of War Camp." Our group entered this place in single file.</p>
<p>(2) Appearance of the Camp</p>
<p>Occupying an area of ​​about two hundred mu, rows of houses are built on it. Surrounding the houses is a layer of electric fence, which is the inner security layer. The outer security layer is a short wall, which is also equipped with cables. Between the two security layers is a road, paved with gravel, quite tidy and clean.</p>
<p>The main building materials of the camp houses are wood. All are bungalows, divided into soldiers' residences, officers' residences, hospitals, kitchens, bathrooms, toilets, livestock farms, etc. In this plain, about 1,500 defeated people are detained in the camp houses.</p>
<p>(3) A Glimpse of Life</p>
<p>(1) Residence: Each soldier's residence accommodates eighteen people, with beds arranged in two rows. Thirty-six people in two rooms form a class, with a class leader in charge of affairs. Officers' residences have one room per person for majors and above, and two or four people per room for those below major. Officers' rooms have heating equipment. The soldiers' beds have thick mattresses and four blankets, all neatly folded. The rooms are clean and swept, the air is circulating and fresh, and the sunlight is very sufficient.</p>
<p>(2) Rest and Work: Wake up at 7:30 AM and lights out at 9:30 PM. The working hours are from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM in the morning and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon, totaling seven hours of work per day.</p>
<p>(3) Diet: Three meals a day, two meals of rice, one meal of bread, with meat, vegetables, and soup, beef, lamb, or pork, potatoes, radishes, and vegetables. It is said that the food is better than what Japanese soldiers fighting are eating now.</p>
<p>(4) Leisure: During leisure time, there are entertainment facilities, American football, baseball, ping-pong, boxing, libraries, etc., all for the physical and mental entertainment of the prisoners.</p>
<p>(4) A Quick Sketch of the Camp</p>
<p>Lieutenant Jin Teng, a Japanese army medical officer, leads the Chinese reporter group to visit the entire camp. Only a few people live in the soldiers' residences, because most of them have gone out to work and have not returned. The soldiers in the room look very healthy.</p>
<p>In the officers' rooms, we saw many English names with different ranks on the doors. The highest officer here is Col. Ashurst, who lives in Room 1, Number 1. The fireplace in the room is very warm. He smiles and nods to the visitors as a courtesy.</p>
<p>The dining hall is very spacious, with pale yellow curtains on the glass windows, very elegant.</p>
<p>The recreation room has three large rooms. The right room contains entertainment equipment, the middle room is a ping-pong room, and the left room is a library, with novels, stories, and other books arranged on the shelves, which are sent by the International Red Cross every month.</p>
<p>The hospital is too well equipped. Apart from large public hospitals in Shanghai, it is probably rare to find one more complete than this. Specially made soundproof walls, with X-ray rooms, sun lamp rooms, operating rooms, pharmacy rooms, treatment rooms, dental treatment rooms, and laboratories, as well as other medical equipment, are too numerous to remember. Based on this point alone, how many hospitals at sea can compare?</p>
<p>After passing the bathroom, a burst of meat aroma suddenly penetrated the nose. It turned out that we had arrived at the kitchen. The kitchen is divided into three parts. One part is a large pot for cooking rice and boiling tea. A row of stoves is cooking white rice. Opening the steamer, a fragrance of rice hits the nose. Water vapor is constantly rising from the kettle, and the sound of hitting the lid is very rhythmic. Another room is where meat is cooked and bread is baked. The cook is cutting beef and lamb into pieces. The pieces are piled up on the table like a small hill. The slightly yellow bread emits a fragrance. The three large iron pots of vegetable and meat soup look even tastier than the sixteen yuan per serving "Russian borscht." Another room is marked "Vegetable Room" at the door, which is dedicated to cooking vegetables.</p>
<p>There are sheep, chickens, and pigs on the livestock farm, all of which are food for the prisoners. They raise and eat their own food, and the taste is endless!</p>
<p>(5) Director Otani's Words</p>
<p>Otani Satoshi, the director of the prisoner of war camp, a colonel in the army, received the reporters and talked to them. Colonel Otani told us:</p>
<p>(1) The total number of prisoners is about 1,500, 1,400 of whom are American soldiers, and the rest are British and other nationalities. They come from Wake Island, Tianjin, and Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Many of the prisoners are technicians, and they now have specialized technical work.</p>
<p>(3) Nine prisoners have attempted to escape, but they have all been caught. The rest are willing to live quietly in the camp.</p>
<p>(4) Clothing is fully available, and the Japanese authorities supplement what is lacking.</p>
<p>(5) The communication method is postcards once a month and letters once every three months, delivered free of charge by the field post office. Many of the prisoners' communication objects are not their family members or parents, but their lovers. I think this is probably a special characteristic of the American young master soldiers.</p>
<p>(6) Some of the prisoners are willing to learn Japanese, and the best of them have reached the level of the sixth grade of Japanese elementary school.</p>
<p>Colonel Otani is about fifty years old, with a short beard. He speaks sincerely, and reveals kindness in his seriousness. Colonel Otani has lived in China for more than four years and seems to be very familiar with China. Finally, he said with emotion:</p>
<p>"On Jing'an Temple Road, I often see many Chinese youths wearing brand-new clothes, holding glamorous women, and entering and exiting restaurants, theaters, dance halls, or leisurely strolling. Such licentious youth life must be re-educated." One of the reporters in the group replied to Colonel Otani, "This is the life of a very small part of the youth in Shanghai, China. The youth outside Shanghai are mostly able to work hard and strive for the restoration of the new China!"</p>
<p>Young friends! Please examine yourselves. Do you live the kind of life that Colonel Otani mentioned? "If you do, correct it quickly. If you don't, work harder!"</p>
<p>We embarked on our return journey. It was already past noon!</p>
<p>Finally, we express our sincere gratitude to Colonel Otani Satoshi for his guidance and tea, Lieutenant Jin Teng for his guidance and explanation during the visit, the assistance of the Army Press Corps, and the support of the Propaganda Department and the Shanghai Office. They planned everything for us, so that we could visit and return smoothly. We wish our colleagues outside of Shanghai a safe journey back!</p>

<h3>Announcement of Sugar Distribution Method Based on Population - Each Person Entitled to Purchase Half a Catty, Packaging Costs Extra</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 6288, explaining that from March 1st, sugar distribution based on population will be implemented. Retail stores within the concession will sell sugar based on sugar ration card coupons. These retail stores should be open for business daily. During the period from March 1st to 31st, retail stores will only sell sugar based on the first coupon of the sugar ration card. The retail store with the registered number indicated on the coupon will sell half a catty of white sugar (top white or snow white) per coupon, priced at 2 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen. If packaging is required, packaging costs will be charged separately. Retail tax will be temporarily waived. Any retail stores that resist or fail to comply with this announcement should immediately report to the nearest police station or the council's office at No. 703 for verification.</p>
<p>Display Registered Number for Identification</p>
<p>After the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office was approved by the military allocation authorities to distribute sugar based on population, it consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the French Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Food Administration Bureau, and was entrusted to issue sugar ration cards. The re-registration of retail merchants has been completed, and the Cooperative Business Office has merged them. All designated retail merchants selling sugar rations will have a registered number, and each store will display a sign for identification. The sign will indicate the area (such as the Joint Concession or the French Concession, etc.) "Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Designated Retail Merchant for Sugar Rations No. XX". According to Shanghai News Agency reporters who inquired at the Cooperative Business Office yesterday, the method for purchasing sugar rations for the first period based on ration cards is as follows:</p>
<p>Method for Distributing Sugar Rations</p>
<p>The Cooperative Business Office announced yesterday that, upon investigation, the authorities have decided to implement sugar distribution based on population starting from March 11th. All sugar sales based on property tax receipts or household registration certificates will be discontinued on March 10th. The following methods are specifically stipulated, and it is hoped that all Category A retail merchants and consumers will be informed: (1) All retail merchants who have been approved to sell sugar rations must sell sugar based on sugar ration cards starting from March 11th. Those in Nanshi, Zhabei, Shanghai West, Pudong, and the city center should use the sugar ration cards issued by the Shanghai Special Municipal Food Administration Bureau. Those in the Public Concession should use the sugar ration cards issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Those in the French Concession should use the sugar ration cards issued by the Municipal Council. Sales must be made according to the designated store number.</p>
<p>Bring Your Own Container to Avoid Paying Retail Tax</p>
<p>Each set of sugar ration cards can be used to purchase half a catty of white sugar, costing 2 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen in Central Reserve Certificates. Retail tax is waived. (3) When consumers purchase sugar with sugar ration cards, they must bring their own sugar containers and purchase it from the designated retail store. If you are unclear about the store number indicated on the sugar ration card, you can inquire at this office (telephone number 83300). (4) The validity period of the sugar ration card is from March 11th to 31st, as stipulated by the authorities. It will be invalid after the expiration date. (5) If any retail store engages in price gouging, short weighing, or adulteration, consumers can report it to this office or report it to the nearest police authority for investigation.</p>
<h3>Fish Industry Association Resumes Business - All Businesses Must Join and Register</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Fish Industry Association has been suspended since the incident. Now, the authorities are ordering the organization of industry associations to handle the allocation of goods and adjust prices. The Fish Industry Association is also responding to the needs of the environment and has been approved by the authorities to resume business and begin operations. All businesses in the industry must join the association to jointly seek the welfare of the industry and comply with the authorities' instructions. Registration is limited to the end of April. The association's address is currently located at No. 20, Qiwupu Road Fish Market.</p>
<h3>Infant Patients Applying for Milk Must Have Three Types of Certificates</h3>
<p>The registration of milk by the Materials Control Department of the Municipal Council has been closed since last Monday due to the limited amount of canned milk available, except for those who have already registered. Currently, infants or patients under the age of three who must use milk as food will be provided with fresh milk instead. For registration procedures, three types of certificates must be presented for verification: birth report, household registration certificate, and doctor's certificate.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Baojia Committee, Similar Organizations Will Be Abolished</h3>
<p>In order to consolidate local security and strengthen the existing Baojia system, the Municipal Government has established a Baojia Committee, with Lu Ying, the Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau, concurrently serving as the chairman. All the details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the committee is internally divided into three sections: General Affairs, Compilation and Investigation, and Training and Guidance. It has now begun operations. All organizations in various districts of the city that are similar to the Baojia Committee should be abolished to concentrate and unify power. In addition to the Qingxiang District, the district offices in various districts should carry out Baojia work in accordance with the committee's instructions.</p>
<h3>Baojia Youth Division to Begin Academic Training</h3>
<p>The Baojia Youth Division has been conducting practical training since last winter for several months. The morale of the members is excellent, and the organizers are teaching effectively, so the results are outstanding. Now, in order to ensure that the members are well-rounded in terms of intellect, morality, physical fitness, and social skills, the authorities of the division will hold academic training for one hour every evening. They are currently looking for a suitable location. Once found, classes will begin.</p>
<h3>YMCA of Shanghai (Eight Immortals Bridge) to Organize Religious Studies Society - Classes to Begin Soon, All Welcome to Join</h3>
<p>The YMCA of Shanghai (Eight Immortals Bridge), in order to promote academic studies and develop the physical and mental well-being of young people, holds several sessions of religious studies societies every year. The society will soon begin classes. The time is every Wednesday and Friday at 5:30 PM.

<h3>Seeking Balance in Supply of Goods: Various Industries Establish Rationing Groups; Required Capital Subscribed by Participating Stores; Items Sold Distributed Fairly by Trade Associations</h3>
<p>In order to balance the distribution of materials and maintain the interests of their members, various trade associations in the city have, according to their respective charters and the provisions of Article 2 of the Trade and Industry Association Law, established "Goods Rationing Groups." After active planning, these groups have now been gradually established and have submitted reports to the Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare, the Public Concession's Bureau of Associations of the Public Works Department, and sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other relevant authorities, and are about to officially begin rationing.</p>
<p>Rational Rationing</p>
<p>The purpose of the establishment of "Materials Rationing Groups" by various trade associations is to ensure rational distribution and balance the supply of goods. Therefore, the necessary resale items of members of these trade associations will be fairly distributed by the respective trade associations. However, the amount of allocation will be determined according to the usual business scope and capital of each business. Those with a larger business scope and abundant capital will be given a sufficient allocation; otherwise, the allocation will be reduced as appropriate. The aim is to prevent illegal hoarding. However, the distributed goods must be bought and sold in accordance with established regulations.</p>
<p>Membership Qualifications</p>
<p>A Shanghai News Agency reporter learned yesterday from various trade associations that the required capital of the Goods Rationing Groups established by each industry is subscribed by the member businesses but must be paid in full at once. Those who cannot afford it will be considered to have voluntarily given up. The qualifications for joining are as follows: (1) Being a member of the association for more than one year; (2) Being able to bear unlimited liability; (3) Having no arrears in association fees in the past and no improper conduct; (4) Being deemed qualified by the highest levels of the association and the general meeting of members, and obtaining permission from the competent authority.</p>
<h3>Second Landlords Licensing Office in Two Concessions Urges License Acquisition; Dispatching Personnel to Conduct Investigations</h3>
<p>The Second Landlords' Management Office in the two concessions has already begun issuing subletting licenses for the upper quarter of this year. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, most of the second landlords in the two concessions have already obtained their licenses. However, a small number have yet to obtain them. Therefore, in addition to urging them to go and obtain them as soon as possible, the authorities have dispatched personnel to conduct investigations.</p>
<h3>Insurance Contract Stamp Duty to Be Implemented Today</h3>
<p>After the promulgation and implementation of the insurance stamp duty law by the Ministry of Industry, all insurance contracts must be affixed with stamp duty. The insurance industry will collect the stamp duty fee from the policyholders (i.e., insureds), which will be affixed at one percent of the premium stated on the insurance contract. The Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has decided that, starting today, all insurance contracts concluded in Shanghai must be affixed in accordance with the regulations. Thereafter, when receiving insurance contracts, all policyholders should pay the stamp duty fee at the same time, and also check whether the stamp duty has been affixed and whether the amount affixed is sufficient. When issuing insurance contracts, insurance company managers should also check clearly. If any deliberate failure to affix stamp duty or affixing of an insufficient amount is discovered, the bureau will handle the matter in accordance with Article 76, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Law. If a policyholder refuses to pay the stamp duty fee, the insurance industry is permitted to report the matter to the bureau at any time for strict punishment in accordance with the law. The bureau has also printed the "Insurance Stamp Duty Monthly Rolling Statement," "Insurance Stamp Duty Monthly Report Book," and an insurance stamp duty application log, which can be collected from the bureau by all insurance companies for recording and future reference. In another report, it was said that Director Sun Zuji of the bureau went to Beijing last month to inspect the current situation of various insurance companies in various regions. Director Sun is unable to personally visit Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other places due to official business. Therefore, he has appointed Wu Tianfu, manager of the Suzhou branch of Taiping Insurance Company, to be responsible for the investigation in Suzhou. Sun Junyi, a public adjudication committee member of the bureau, is responsible for Wuxi, and Li Juntian, chief of the third section of the bureau, is responsible for Hangzhou. The investigation is expected to be completed within half a month.</p>
<h3>The Publicity Department's Shanghai Office Convened a Small Seminar with Journalists Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, Feng Jie, the director of the Shanghai office of the Publicity Department, convened a meeting with responsible personnel of the existing Shanghai tabloids, one month after the reorganization of the Shanghai tabloids. Those who attended the meeting included Zhong Youcai, director of the News Inspection Office, Deng Yinxian of the Oriental Daily, Yi Liren of the Jibao, Liang Zihua of the Theater World, Shao Yunpiao of the Seabird Daily, Wei Daren of the Big Report, Wang Xuechen of the Shanghai Daily, and Chen Tingchao of the Social Daily. Mr. Feng asked about the situation of each newspaper after the reorganization and expressed his views, saying, "This time, the government adjusted the Shanghai tabloids after careful consideration and repeated consultations before implementing it. We have great expectations for the future role of the tabloids. In the past, quite a few people mistakenly believed that having a tabloid in hand meant they could arbitrarily slander, attack, and vent personal grievances, thinking that this was the authority of a newspaper. They did not know that authority is established on the value of social education. Merely using newspapers as personal tools, leading to the reversal of right and wrong, confusing the public, provoking social animosity, and stimulating hatred, is self-defeating and ultimately useless, or even harmful, to the Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, using newspapers as a means of extortion is even more unacceptable to the government. I hope all newspapers will deeply understand that during this difficult time of national construction, it is essential to recognize the importance of their own mission and respect their own value. All reporting should aim to stimulate positive social progress, cooperation, guidance towards good, and achieve the effect of social education. I have the greatest determination to prevent the existence of the past's degraded state." Subsequently, the matter of the rational development of each newspaper was discussed. The meeting adjourned at about 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Materials Control Department Approves Pricing of Cotton Fluffing Services</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Fluffing Trade Association, due to the rising cost of cotton, must adjust the prices of various cotton and cotton fluff products in order to maintain its capital. After the trade association drafted the sales prices of various grades of cotton fluff, it submitted them to the Materials Control Department for review and approval. The approved and implemented prices are as follows: (1) Special grade white cotton is 15 yuan per catty; (2) Second grade white cotton is 10 yuan per catty; (3) Rolled cotton is at least 2 yuan; (4) Processing cotton wadding with added yarn is 6 yuan per piece; (5) Adding yarn to cotton wadding (ordinary) is 16 yuan per piece; (6) Dense yarn robe and skirt wadding, with a width of 5 feet or more and a length of 6 feet or more, etc., can be negotiated; (7) Cotton wadding less than 5 catties must also be calculated as 5 catties; (8) Rolled cotton less than 1 catty must also be calculated as 1 catty. All of the above goods must use the city scale as the standard and must not be increased or decreased privately. Those who violate this will be severely punished by the authorities. All cotton fluffing shops in all districts of the city must comply with this price limit in order to achieve uniformity.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper was released at 7:40 AM.</p>
<h3>Travelers Renting Rooms Must Present Their Travel Permits for Inspection</h3>
<p>In order to prevent theft, the authorities in the two concessions stipulated last winter that customers of pawnshops, hotels, and inns must present their Citizen's ID or Residence Permit to prevent criminals from infiltrating. However, according to reports from the Datong News Agency, most pawnshops are indeed implementing the system of requiring certificates for pledged items. However, some hotels and inns often accommodate lodgers from other places, who often do not have a Citizen's ID to present. Therefore, hotels often leniently accommodate them. However, in order to comply with the authorities' intentions, the police have recently notified all hotels and inns that long-term residents must obtain a Residence Permit or Citizen's ID in accordance with the general procedures for residents. As for temporary lodgers, when renting rooms in hotels, they must present their travel permits and other documents brought from other places for inspection to show that they are indeed legitimate travelers.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Concession Bureau Announcement March 9, 1943</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Investigation Team Uncovers Major Kidnapping and Ransom Case; Ring Leader Zhang Yinlong Under Interrogation</h3>
<p>On July 30 of last year, a number of bandits kidnapped Wang Xinzhai, the owner of the Xinchang Egg Factory, at No. 260 Huagenei Road, and demanded a large ransom. The Investigation Team of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters cracked the case at No. 50 Huayuan Village, Bailinan Road, and arrested six important criminals involved in the case, including Ouyang Fengci. After strict interrogation, in addition to making a full confession, they also confessed that the scheme was planned by Zhang Yinlong, who had previously committed the kidnapping of Wu Zhesheng, general manager of the Dachunghua Rubber Factory, Zhang Jiaju, president of the Salt Industry Bank, Yao Yutang, owner of the Chongqing Yihe Yarn Factory, and others in 1941. The Garrison Headquarters executed Ouyang Fengci and others first, and also strictly ordered the arrest of the principal offender Zhang Yinlong to be brought to justice. However, after many days, his whereabouts could not be found. At 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month, Gu Baolin, an attaché of the investigation team of the Garrison Headquarters, and team member Zhang Xuechang were passing through the Baxianqiao area of the French Concession on business when they happened to see Zhang Yinlong, the principal offender in the case, walking towards them. They immediately joined forces with Chinese Constable No. 1214 to arrest him. The suspect, knowing that he had been exposed, fled in panic, running to the building at No. 32 Songcun Lane, Geluo Road. The pursuers followed him there. In desperation, the suspect jumped from the building, trying to escape. However, because the distance from the ground was too great, he fell in front of the door and was arrested. He was taken to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<h3>The Emerging Burma (3)</h3>
<p>— Qinglian</p>
<p>(7) Military Administration Under Japanese Rule</p>
<p>In mid-January 1942, the Japanese army began operations from the Thai-Burmese border. On January 31, it captured Moulmein. On March 8, it occupied the capital, Rangoon, and immediately turned its attention northward, encircling Mandalay-Ava from three sides. The British-Indian army and the Chongqing army, totaling about 300,000 troops, were defeated by the Japanese army. On May 1, Ava fell. On May 8, the Japanese army broke through the Yunnan-Burmese border and reached Tengyue in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>The rapid victory of the Japanese army in Burma was, as admitted by General Alexander, commander of the British-Indian Allied Forces in Burma, due to the Japanese army's unpredictable tactics, the sharpness of its weapons, and the cooperation of the Burmese people with the Japanese army. In particular, the Burmese Independence Army (B.I.A.), under Japanese guidance, was filled with the patriotic and anti-British fervor of Burmese youth, who firmly believed in Japanese assistance and paved the way for a Japanese victory with their bare hands.</p>
<p>After the British-Indian army withdrew from Burma, peace work began immediately, and the security of Burma was established through the efforts of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Iida, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces in Burma, issued a proclamation on March 8 of last year, implementing military administration. At the same time, an administrative organ organized by Burmese people was established, and Dr. Ba Maw and six others were appointed as preparation committee members of the central administrative organ. On August 1, Supreme Commander Iida appointed Ba Maw as the head of the Executive Administration. Under the Executive Administration, there were departments for internal affairs, finance, agriculture, commerce and industry, transportation and irrigation, forestry, civil engineering reconstruction, judiciary, education and health. The heads of each department were summoned by Ba Maw and submitted to the Japanese Supreme Commander for approval. On the same day, the fundamental principles were announced:</p>
<p>(1) The military commander grasps the outline of the rule.</p>
<p>(2) No unnecessary interference is to be made in the administration of Burma itself.</p>
<p>(3) The goal of all administration is to concentrate on completing the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(4) Strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, making it a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere centered on Japan.</p>
<p>In addition to the nine departments mentioned above, the Executive Administration also has four special departments: the Chief's Secretariat, directly subordinate bureaus, legal advisors, and the ×× Committee. The heads of each department are appointed by the Japanese Supreme Commander. In addition to directly managing the use of troops, diplomacy, enemy property, defense of Burma, and judicial matters, the Supreme Commander, in principle, entrusts the Executive Administration to carry out other administrative affairs.</p>
<p>The Executive Administration, headed by Ba Maw as Chief, Tha Kin Mya as Deputy Chief, and Kono Genjin as Chief of the Chief's Secretariat, jointly promoted administrative affairs, concentrating on:</p>
<p>(1) Rapidly establishing security.</p>
<p>(2) Facilitating transportation.</p>
<p>(3) Thoroughly improving education and hygiene.</p>
<p>In order to stabilize local public sentiment, concurrently with the establishment of the Executive Administration, Burmese county magistrates were appointed for the thirty-seven counties, and the candidates for the police chiefs of each county were determined. The county magistrates continued the work of the security maintenance committees, maintaining security and promoting administrative affairs under the guidance of the Japanese army. The capital, Rangoon, was also declared a special city on September 25, and U Seth was appointed as mayor.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the Japanese army, the Executive Administration clarified the past situation of small parties standing in Burma, and promoted the merger of the two largest Burmese parties, the Tha Kin Party (approximately 400,000 members, led by Tha Kin Mya) and the New Anti-Sa Party (approximately 150,000 members, led by Dr. Ba Maw), and launched a national movement under the slogan "Burmese people build Burma."</p>
<p>Even more noteworthy is the formation of the Burmese Defense Army. That is, when the Japanese army entered Burmese territory, those among the Burmese youth who understood the Japanese army's true intentions of expelling the violent British organized the Burmese Independence Army, obtained assistance such as weapons and ammunition from the Japanese side, and rose up in all directions, cooperating greatly with the Japanese army in the battles of Rangoon and Ava. After the Japanese army occupied all of Burma, it disbanded all Burmese Independence Army soldiers on July 1. Under the leadership of the Japanese Supreme Commander, a new Burmese Defense Army was formed, and most of the Independence Army soldiers were absorbed into the Defense Army.</p>
<p>The Burmese Defense Army, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Military Affairs, is engaged in border security and local defense work day and night, and a Burmese Defense Army cadet training unit has been newly established and is being actively trained by the Japanese army as the national army of the new Burma.</p>
<p>(8) The Economy of the New Burma</p>
<p>Burma and Sumatra are the regions with the most undeveloped resources within the "Southern Sphere." Before the war, British investment in Burma was about 5 billion pounds, and the annual profit was up to 20 percent of the investment. Since the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the tungsten and tin urgently needed in British wartime materials have been almost entirely supplied by Burma, with production more than doubling compared to pre-war levels. This also shows that Burma is one of Britain's most important logistics bases in the East.</p>
<p>Burma is a world-renowned agricultural country, producing about 6 million tons of rice annually, of which 3.5 million tons are exported. Therefore, the words "Rangoon Rice" are a well-known term in the world market. Sixty percent of it is shipped to India, and the rice alone constitutes an indispensable relationship between India and Burma. The rice production in 1942 is said to be very good, which can supplement the food shortages in Malaya and Sumatra. In view of the importance of rice, the Military Administration Office established the Japan-Burma Rice Management Association, consisting of three Japanese companies, to control the purchase, milling, and export of rice, and began operations as early as May 5 of last year.</p>
<p>Burmese cotton, with an annual production of 300,000 dans, and which was imported into Japan before the Greater East Asia War, is also of extremely good quality. If improved, its future is even more limitless. The Military Administration Office has designated three Japanese textile companies to establish a five-year cotton planting plan, with the goal of increasing production many times more than the current level by the time of completion.</p>
<p>Next to rice and cotton in agricultural resources are forest products, mainly the malipo tree. The Japan-Burma Timber Management Association began operations on April 5 of last year, starting logging in the Irrawaddy River, Jiang River, and Salween River areas.</p>
<p>As for abundant mineral deposits, such as lead, copper, petroleum, and tin, which are major resources in the war, the Japanese side is stepping up their recovery.</p>
<p>In order to develop industries and collect materials, the Military Administration Office has set up funds to help develop the most important projects for Japan, such as rice, cotton, mines, industries, trade, miscellaneous grains, and timber. In addition, it is actively assisting in the development of various projects necessary to improve national production and maintain security, and is further considering joint Japanese-Burmese investment in all major development projects.</p>
<p>In terms of trade, the Military Administration Office implements a licensing system for import and export industries, and implements import and export controls through the cooperative system. The "Burma Materials Distribution Control Cooperative," consisting of departments such as textiles, machinery, metals, fuels, chemical sundries, and food, has been formed to promote planned trade between Japan and Burma.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, the general policy is to minimize the burden on the finances of the Japanese Empire, to cultivate economic combat power, eliminate extraordinary phenomena, and gradually achieve a point of balancing income and expenditure. For the expenses necessary to defend Burma, efforts are also being made to achieve a certain degree of local self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>As of the end of August, the expenditures were 240,000 rupees for the administrative expenses of the Military Administration Office during the period until the establishment of the Executive Administration, and more than 1 million rupees for the expenses required for the establishment of the Executive Administration, totaling more than 1 million rupees including other expenses. The taxes collected by the Military Administration Office up to the same date amounted to more than 200,000 rupees for liquor tax, more than 200,000 rupees for export tax, more than 100,000 rupees for import tax, several hundred thousand rupees for salt tax, and 1 million rupees in total including other taxes. If the income is insufficient, it is included in the budget of the Executive Administration by means of temporary overdrafts.</p>
<p>The general structure of the Executive Administration is not yet sound, and the collection of taxes naturally still has many difficulties. However, efforts are being made to improve it. The ordinary budget of the Executive Administration for this year is about 100 million rupees, and everything from the tax system is inherited from the old system, but there have been some changes in customs duties and income tax.</p>
<p>The budget for the Shan States Federation for the second half of last year was approximately 1 million rupees.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, Yokohama Specie Bank opened a branch in Rangoon on April 15 to meet the needs of general deposits and loans. The bank also established "branch offices" in Bassein on September 1, Moulmein on September 7, and Ava on October 15, and is actively preparing in other locations, striving to develop industry in Burma. In addition, the "Southern Development Bank Burma Branch" also opened on August 24 to carry out industrial financing work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, indigenous financial institutions, such as pawnshops and Indian lenders, which played a significant financial role before the war, have not yet fully resumed operations. In order to encourage the opening of businesses and provide guidance and supervision, the Military Administration Office promulgated a loan industry ordinance on September 20.</p>
<p>There were more than 200 British-Indian banks in Burma before the war, but they have all been closed. However, in order to avoid hindering finance, the Military Administration Office has decided to allow non-enemy banks to resume operations in order. The "Jietie" Bank, organized by Indians, was first urged to open. The bank has more than 40 branches in Burma and will use them to absorb local floating funds and make them financial institutions for farmers and ordinary people.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of the Central Bank of Burma, it is also being actively discussed.</p>
<p>Regarding the currency system, the Japanese Supreme Commander announced on May 1 that local currency and Japanese military notes would be legal tender at equal value and would be used uniformly. Because the original Burmese currency was one rupee equals sixteen annas, and one anna equals twelve piasters, which was inconvenient to calculate, an order to adjust the monetary unit was announced on September 15, and a new system of one rupee to one hundred qian (fen) was implemented on October 15.</p>
<p>In order to absorb floating funds from the private sector, the Executive Administration issued a total of 1 million rupees in lottery tickets, and plans to issue the same amount of lottery tickets four times each year in the future.</p>
<p>In this way, Burma's finance and finance are moving towards a new future under a planned Japanese policy.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Exchange Reopening</h3>
<p>Shanghai originally had two exchanges, one being the Chinese-owned China Merchants Securities Exchange and the other being the foreign-owned Union Internationale de Bourse. The former, though named an exchange, lacked substantive content and was merely a platform for speculation. The latter, dealing in stock trading, had as many as 155 types of stocks, with flourishing business. Both of these were closed by the authorities after the Japanese army occupied the concessions.</p>
<p>Although the exchanges were closed, the trading of securities actually continued as before. Generally, idle funds flocked to the buying and selling of Chinese stocks, leading to an unprecedented boom in Chinese stock trading. The soaring prices and the proliferation of stock companies, with trading locations scattered everywhere, were phenomena of this period. At the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there were only nineteen stock companies in Shanghai, but now they have increased to one hundred and twenty-eight, indicating the vigor of the business. Examining the reasons for this, it is nothing more than the mischief of idle capital. The authorities sought countermeasures, resulting in the declaration to reopen the exchanges.</p>
<p>The announcement of the reopening of the exchanges was made on October 30th of last year. The authorities stated that after reopening, the exchanges would only be allowed to operate under military administration, dealing in Chinese stocks and central and local government bonds, to promote the economic recovery of the peace zone. As for the speculation engaged in by merchants in the past, it would be strictly prohibited. On December 1st, the Shanghai Embassy Office of Japan also issued a statement, registering listed stocks and brokers, reiterating that the purpose of reopening the exchanges was to guide idle capital into the production sector. Since then, all parties have placed great hopes on the reopening of the exchanges, but to this day it has not materialized, and it is said that there are many internal difficulties, which seem difficult to resolve in the short term. However, this is also a matter of time, and the reopening proposal will surely be realized one day.</p>
<p>What will be the task of the reopened exchange? According to the statement issued by the Embassy, the reopened exchange will use the adjustment of stock prices as a means to enable national capital to flow into necessary industrial sectors, and at the same time, it will observe the results of the reopening. If the results are not bad, the trading objects will also extend to other securities and government bonds. From this, it can be said that the stocks of various companies related to the revitalization of Central China and important industries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere may also have the possibility of being listed. Because after these types of stocks are listed, the authorities can use the Shanghai market to guide the idle capital here into important industries in various places. This is the purpose of the authorities in reopening the exchanges, but judging from the facts, it may not be easy to achieve. Because the general interest rate in China has already risen to three percent, and with only five or six percent of profit, it is impossible to arouse the interest of the general public in investing. If stock trading purely turns into speculation, not only will the original intention of reopening be completely lost, but the phenomenon of currency inflation in Shanghai may also affect other regions. Therefore, inducing idle capital into necessary industries cannot be expected from the future Shanghai Exchange.</p>
<p>However, all that has been said does not mean that reopening the exchange is meaningless. The reopening of the exchange can also confine speculation within the exchange. If this can be achieved, it would also be a major gain. I sincerely hope that the authorities will resolutely implement this goal. (Toyo Keizai Shinpo No. 2060)</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Economic Police</h3>
<p>Mencius spoke of the goodness of human nature, while Xunzi spoke of the evil of human nature. If Mencius' theory were indeed correct, then everyone would be kind, law-abiding, and would not do things that harm others to benefit themselves. The government would not need ordinary police in peacetime, nor would it need to add economic police in wartime. However, experience tells us that human nature, if allowed to develop freely, mostly tends towards harming others to benefit oneself. Therefore, Xunzi's theory of the evil of human nature is more reliable, and the theory of the police state of the Legalists has become popular in various countries in modern times, both East and West. That is, ordinary police are set up in peacetime to maintain law and order, and economic police are added in wartime to prevent profiteering and maintain the stability of the rear.</p>
<p>During wartime, countries around the world implemented an economic police system, and the most perfect ones were said to be Germany and Japan. Now, the authorities of the Shanghai Public Concession, in order to suppress speculation, lower prices, and seek the stability of people's livelihood, made a formal decision at the end of last year to prepare for the organization of economic police. They are currently recruiting and training personnel. The most important training item is to make them understand the inside story of the economic conditions of Shanghai, and to teach them how to investigate speculation and other illegal profiteering activities.</p>
<p>An orange becomes a trifoliate orange when it crosses the Huai River. In modern times, the good laws and good intentions of various countries mostly turn into bad phenomena that cause harm before benefits are seen when they enter China. The crux of the problem is that there are methods of governance but no people to govern. Therefore, if the implementation of the economic police system is to be perfect, the municipal authorities must promote the comprehensiveness of the methods of governance from the position of governing people, so that it can be effective.</p>
<h3>Mr. Kikujiro Takashima's Speech on Financial Control</h3>
<p>Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, Advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, recently returned to Shanghai from Beijing and expressed his views on controlling finance to Japanese reporters as follows: 1. The financial authorities promulgated the loan restriction measures this time because they saw that unscrupulous merchants used funds to hoard and speculate, causing drastic fluctuations in prices, so they had to find ways to control the flow of funds. Now that the loan restriction measures have been promulgated, the loans of banks and money shops will be subject to review. If it is found that they have a speculative color, they will be immediately prohibited. However, funds for purchasing agricultural products and promoting industrial production should be encouraged by the banking industry to provide. 2. The implementation of loan restriction measures cannot be based on administrative power, but must be based on the automatic cooperation of the financial community. The financial authorities and the financial community have agreed several times and decided to select a dozen or so knowledgeable people from the banking industry to serve as members of the Loan Review Committee, and the government will no longer send people to participate. 3. The basic work of financial control at present is to limit loans. The loan regulations can be made in two or three days. Regarding the merger of banks, it is currently difficult to do so, because it is not as easy to implement in China as it is in Japan. (China Information)</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Allowed to be Freely Traded</h3>
<p>This newspaper previously published the news that coarse grains will be freely traded, and now it has become a reality. The Coarse Grain Association has received orders from the authorities yesterday. Special notice to the industry: It has been found that the issue of coarse grain trading has been discussed by the Association with the military allocation authorities. Now, the authorities have taken into account the difficult situation of grain merchants and have approved the request. The methods are now listed on the left:</p>
<p>(1) Five kinds of raw materials with oil content, such as soybeans, raw peanuts, sesame seeds, rapeseed, and cottonseed, are limited to 75% for purchase by the military allocation authorities (limited to delivery in Shanghai warehouses). The price is temporarily set by the authorities, and the remaining 25% can be freely sold by members of the Association.</p>
<p>(2) Ordinary coarse grains, such as corn, red sorghum, and broad beans, are limited to 50% for purchase by the military allocation authorities (limited to delivery in Shanghai warehouses). The price is temporarily set by the authorities, and the remaining 50% can be freely sold by members of the Association.</p>
<p>(3) For those who provide their own sacks (such as new sacks, they can apply to the authorities for commercial loans through the Association), the Association should apply to the authorities for the issuance of transportation permits.</p>
<p>If members of the industry intend to sell and operate, they should immediately send samples to the Association for registration. However, according to the opinions of general grain merchants, they feel quite grateful for the authorities' grant of free trading, but because the situation in each production area is different and they have been lacking transportation for a long time, most of them still hold a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Sixty-Five Stock Companies Sealed Up by the Authorities Yesterday The Shanghai Municipal Council Hosts Press Conference to Make Statement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities yesterday issued the following statement regarding the investigation and sealing up of companies operating securities businesses without a license: It has been found that there are many companies and firms engaged in securities trading without obtaining permission. Judging from the content of their business, most of them are improper speculative transactions, which have a profound and significant impact on prices and the reaction of the general public. Under the current economic conditions in Shanghai, it is difficult to allow them to continue. The Bureau previously ordered inquiries into the two major stock companies, China and Yongchang, and published Bulletin No. 6281 on March 2, implying that companies and firms that have not obtained permission should automatically cease operations. However, these companies and firms have not shown any intention to cooperate with the Bureau's policies. Therefore, the Bureau has resolutely ordered the sealing up of the following fifteen stock companies that continue to operate without permission. As for how the Bureau will deal with these stock companies that have been ordered to be sealed up in the future, it is not yet time to announce it. It is hoped that due to the sealing up of these companies, extremely unsound stock speculation and the rise in securities prices that are sufficient to incite the public will be curbed, and the general idle capital will be gathered in sound business investments. As for the proper buying and selling business of securities itself, there is originally nothing to criticize. The Bureau will have no objection to those who have obtained permission from the relevant authorities in accordance with legal procedures and operate under the supervision of the relevant authorities. The list of stock companies that have been sealed up is as follows:</p>

<h3>Origins of Recent Price Increases Hoarding Still Not Eliminated Increased Demand for Materials</h3>
<p>There are several reasons for the recent rise in prices: 1. The hoarding trend after the start of the war still persists inertly. 2. The general public has great confidence in reserve certificates, but still believes that goods can be exchanged for money at any time, while money is not easy to exchange for goods at any time. 3. Many people generally believe that the need for materials in various places has increased compared to the past. 4. The instability of old currencies and the hoarding trend near the war zone have affected Shanghai. If financial control is strengthened and the exchange of materials is smooth, prices will fall. (China Information)</p>
<h3>Economic Trends and Miscellaneous Writings from Various Places</h3>
<p>— Caomao</p>
<p>Strict Control of Cigarettes in Central China</p>
<p>The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association, which was decided at the end of last year to be jointly funded by China and Japan with 60 million storage currency to control the cigarette and tobacco leaf business in the Central China region, will be announced recently in Shanghai. In recent months, as a result of cigarette hoarding and manipulation, black market prices have risen sharply. They are planning to completely prevent and set standard prices for cigarettes, from retailers to wholesalers. As a result of the implementation of the cigarette control and distribution system, the chaotic cigarette market in Shanghai will gradually tend to normalize. Under this new distribution system, the authorities have decided that 300 registered retailers will be able to obtain limited-price cigarettes from Wing Tai &amp; Co. and supply them for sale at low prices.</p>
<p>Increased Production of Aluminum in North China</p>
<p>The production of aluminum in North China will be expanded on a large scale in the region under the plan of the Japanese Air Liquide Manufacturing Co. They will innovate the method of refining aluminum, that is, changing from the past method of refining with electricity to the newly invented soda filter induction system. In such an innovation, they can obtain better aluminum on the one hand.</p>
<p>Artificial Rubber Invented in Japan</p>
<p>Professor Kita of the erudite Kyoto Imperial University of Japan announced last month that the artificial synthetic rubber, which he had studied for a long time, had finally appeared in an economical and new method that was easy to use. This synthetic rubber is an indispensable military raw material in the current war, because it can resist strong heat and oil attack. Using this new method will make the production method of synthetic rubber very easy and simple. This new invention is more economical and simple than the methods currently used in Germany and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>New Discovery of Light Oil Manufacturing</p>
<p>The Tokyo Afforestation Experiment Bureau, affiliated to the Japanese Imperial Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station, announced last month that in a new experiment, it discovered a kind of light oil that can be used in industry and manufacturing, just like alcohol and benzoyl oil. It obtains its combined carbon from trees at low temperatures.</p>
<p>In the past, we only knew that the forests that could produce light oil were limited to pine and cypress trees, but if we can apply this newly discovered method, we can obtain the same light oil from any tree.</p>
<p>The Japanese Imperial Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station is now planning to set up large-scale factories in Hakodate or Gifu in order to produce light oil on a large scale under this new method. (Translated from Asia Magazine, February issue)</p>
<h3>Kikujiro Takashima Succeeds as President of the Central China Development Company</h3>
<p>After Mr. Kenji Kodama, President of the Central China Development Company, resigned, the authorities decided on the 8th to appoint Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, former President of Oji Paper Co., as the second President of the Central China Development Company after weighing the candidates. The first phase of the Central China Development Company's business goal was to restore the war-damaged industry in Central China, which has been fully achieved. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government successively joined the war, so the goal of the second phase is to focus on strengthening the National Government and cultivating combat power, which is of great significance. After Mr. Kodama successfully retired, Mr. Takashima succeeded in his vacancy. Mr. Takashima has extensive knowledge and experience, and I believe he will make great contributions. His brief resume is as follows:</p>
<p>Graduated from Tokyo Higher Commercial School in the 33rd year of Meiji, transferred from Mitsui Bussan Co. to Oji Paper Co. in the first year of Taisho. In less than six years, he was promoted to managing director, promoted to vice president in the eighth year of Taisho, and served as president in the thirteenth year. Resigned in December of the 17th year of Taisho.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Side Expresses Good Feelings Towards the New President</h3>
<p>It is also known that after the news of Mr. Kikujiro Takashima's succession as the second President of the Central China Development Company came, the Chinese economic community unanimously expressed good feelings. At a time when Japan is actively strengthening the National Government's structure, all parties have great expectations for Mr. Takashima. Mr. Shen, Managing Director of the Bank of China, made a statement on the 8th as follows!</p>
<p>Mr. Kikujiro Takashima came to Nanjing last year. I met Mr. Takashima in Beijing. He is very concerned about China and has deep friendships with Chinese people. I believe he will make many contributions to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future.</p>
<h3>Former President Kenji Kodama Completes Mission and Resigns</h3>
<p>It is also known that Mr. Kenji Kodama, the former President of the Central China Development Company, has spared no effort in the past five years since he took office as the first president on November 7, Showa 13, to revive the war-torn industry in Central China. All public utilities such as communications, transportation, mining, electricity, water supply, and fisheries, as well as all construction projects in Shanghai, are flourishing. There are fourteen companies and two major associations under his jurisdiction, which have made great contributions to restoring industry, developing resources, and expanding trade. Mr. Kodama has a deep relationship with China. In the 44th year of Meiji, he served as the president of the branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank for ten years. In March of Showa 12, when Sino-Japanese relations were tense, he came to Shanghai as the head of the economic inspection group, intending to start with economic cooperation to break the deadlock and ease the national relations between the two countries. He returned to Japan in April of the same year. Unfortunately, the incident occurred shortly after. He came to China for the third time as the president of the Central China Development Company, starting to solve the China problem and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation matters. He has been in office for five years and has worked hard to guide the related companies of the Central China Development Company. All parties express regret for his resignation this time (Continental News, March 9)</p>
<h3>Wuxi Silk Market is Tight</h3>
<p>Although the silk price in this county has not been selling well since the beginning of the lunar year, the market price has been rising continuously. The current selling price per dan is more than double that of last December. The reasons are often nothing more than hoarding from middlemen, only absorbing and not spitting out, which affects people's hearts upwards and creates today's phenomenon. According to silk industry insiders, the production of silkworms in this county has sharply decreased since the incident, and the sales channels are small, so the past price was low and it was not noticed by general hoarders. Since the price surge last autumn, idle capital has been doing mischief everywhere, and silk has also become an exception. Once invaded by speculative merchants, the market price has risen step by step, without end. In addition, the authorities have not yet restricted the price of silk, so its rising speed has set an unprecedented record. At present, the market is almost more than ten times higher than a year ago, and the tension in the market can be seen.</p>

<h3>Further Review of the Problem of Floating Capital</h3>
<p>— Lu Tingfang</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* economic section on March 4th and 5th consecutively published two articles regarding the issue of absorbing surplus purchasing power. One article was "A Humble Proposal for Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power," originally written by Kuraota Hirose and translated by Ren Yunpeng. The other was "A Review of Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power" by Ren Lin. I believe this issue is extremely important. At the same time, the issue of absorbing surplus purchasing power can also be said to be a part of the overall problem of floating capital. In Ren Lin's article, he mentioned the recent increase in bank floating deposits, believing that there is a possibility of re-forming surplus purchasing power. I think Ren Lin may share the same view that the issue of absorbing surplus purchasing power is a part of the problem of floating capital.</p>
<p>The existence of various morbidities in the economic system often has its own interrelated cause and effect. To completely eliminate the existence of various morbidities, countermeasures must be sought from multiple perspectives and must start from the most basic viewpoints. Simply trying to solve the problem by treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts will hardly achieve satisfactory results. In my previous article, "On the Future of Enterprises from the Perspective of Enterprise Distress," I explained that it is not enough to simply focus on currency to seek a reasonable solution to the price problem. My view on the problem of floating capital is the same.</p>
<p>If the absorption of surplus purchasing power can be promoted smoothly and fully meet our ideals, it will naturally greatly benefit the solution of the floating capital problem. However, during the promotion process, we cannot but anticipate the resistance that may occur. In particular, the so-called mandatory use of commodity coupons to buy up hoarded commodities is more likely to arouse public resentment and risk stimulating price increases. Although we do not need to consider the interests of hoarders now, it is easy to distinguish between what are hoarded commodities by hoarders and what are legitimate inventories of industrial and commercial enterprises, but it is actually very difficult to distinguish. Moreover, hoarders have ingenious methods, and no matter how strict the mandatory measures are, they still have ways to avoid them. On the contrary, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises are at risk of being caught in the crossfire. This can be asserted. We understand that the implementation of economic policies is not enough to rely solely on the determination of the authorities. To make the practical process twice as effective with half the effort, we must have the cooperation of the people, especially the industrial and commercial enterprises. Now is the time when we are united in promoting the wartime economic policy program, and we need the sincere cooperation of the people. We must think about the overall situation and proceed cautiously, trying our best to avoid policies that may arouse public resentment.</p>
<p>The so-called surplus purchasing power is actually another name for floating capital. Because this purchasing power is completely in the hands of a few people, presenting a character that is divorced from production. As for the majority of people in the society, their purchasing power is not only not surplus, but is clearly insufficient. This floating capital can be used for hoarding commodities today, and it can also be used as floating deposits in banks tomorrow. From the standpoint of the entire society, when floating capital is used for hoarding goods, on the one hand, those who hoard goods can temporarily find a place to entrust their surplus purchasing power, and on the other hand, those who sell goods still have to find targets for the funds they obtain. This target is either investment or speculation. Although the use of commodity coupons as a means of buying up commodities can achieve some effect in absorbing floating capital, its effect is no different from forcibly promoting a certain amount of government bonds. Moreover, there is an additional concern that it may stimulate price increases. Today, if a government bond is forcibly promoted, no matter how normal the use of this government bond is, few people will be willing to accept it willingly. Because the method of promotion contains a mandatory nature, it somewhat reduces the credit of the securities. Moreover, even if the issuance of government bonds does not contain a mandatory nature, it is difficult to predict how it will be digested in the current market with such high interest rates.</p>
<p>However, since the rampant floating capital and the mischief of surplus purchasing power have already caused us a lot of harm, we naturally cannot ignore it. Here, we must talk about the causes of floating capital, because only by grasping the causes of the problem can we solve it fundamentally. Fang Fu'an had an article in the inaugural issue of the "China Industry Monthly" reviewing Shanghai's floating capital in the past five years, which provides a very detailed description of the situation of Shanghai's floating capital. Readers may wish to refer to it. Mr. Fang said in his conclusion: "Shanghai was originally a concentrated area of floating capital in China. Before the war, although the amount was not large, its causes were the exploitation of powerful economies and the exploitation of feudalism, which eventually caused rural funds to flow into cities, and then concentrated in Shanghai." He also said: "Although the amount of Shanghai's floating capital today has increased more than ten times compared to the past, the causes of floating capital and its harmful effects are very different from the past. How should it be guided to enter the right track of enterprise? This is a major issue today." Although Mr. Fang did not explain the causes of today's floating capital and the differences from the past, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the fact that various legitimate production enterprises have been forced to stop their activities due to various artificial factors during the war is the most important reason for the occurrence of today's floating capital. At present, the high degree of restriction on the exchange of materials between various regions is the biggest reason for restricting production activities. Now that this reason can be given good consideration and appropriately relaxed, it will definitely increase the activity of legitimate production enterprises. The activity of production enterprises is indeed the best policy for absorbing floating capital.</p>
<p>In addition, like the recently revealed issuance of lottery tickets, incentives for savings, and reorganization of autonomous control organizations, directly and indirectly, can all have a positive impact on the problem of floating capital.</p>

<h3>On Wit</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>The so-called tactless person is a person who lacks wit. Because their responses are not appropriate, they lose friendships, and when they do things, they "put in a lot of effort but get no credit," working hard without success. If they mess things up, they are ridiculed everywhere.</p>
<p>Disaster comes from the mouth. A person without wit often offends many people unintentionally, to the point that he cannot cooperate with others; this creates a psychology of aversion to the crowd, affecting his lifelong achievements.</p>
<p>A witty person can often achieve twice the result with half the effort. He knows when he should speak, and he speaks when he should. He does what he should do. He expresses sympathy to others. While considering his own interests, he also considers the interests of others. He will use gentle tones and polite language to persuade those who oppose him. He will never say anything disappointing when others are happy. He respects others, but it is not flattering pretense. He can grasp the interests of others. He does not publicly expose the weaknesses of others... These are originally the conditions for adapting to the environment and having leadership skills.</p>
<p>The lack of wit is due to a lack of knowledge of current affairs and slow thinking. Therefore, this kind of person is very pitiful. Their nature is not bad, and they also want to live a happy and gregarious life. Therefore, after failing, they often do not understand the reason for their failure. They wonder why they do not harbor malicious intentions, but people want to alienate them?</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that wit is indeed an art of being a person. Because wit is meant to please people, and it is not the "flattery" of common parlance. If someone misunderstands wit as flattery, then it is also easy to flatter the wrong person, resulting in the opposite effect and becoming a truly despicable failure.</p>
<p>Science Essay</p>
<h3>How Do We Live?</h3>
<p>— Peng Xiong</p>
<p>We all know that we live in the world, but not everyone necessarily knows how our bodies are living. If everyone could understand this problem, perhaps it would make some people cherish their bodies more.</p>
<p>The human body is like a machine. To make this machine work, you have to add coal to make a fire. The coal that our body needs is food, and the fire that is produced is the oxygen inhaled into the lungs. Although the things we eat three meals a day are varied, the main material components are only protein, fat, and carbohydrates. When these three things exist in food, they usually cannot be directly applied to the body. They must first undergo a series of adjustments, and this work is "digestion." After we swallow food into our mouth, it enters the intestines through the esophagus and stomach. In the mouth and stomach, the food is digested into all parts, on the one hand turning large pieces into small pieces, and on the other hand turning solid things into liquids. In the small intestine, on the one hand, digestion continues to facilitate absorption, and on the other hand, the useful components are "absorbed" into the lacteal vessels through the small intestinal wall. The remaining residue after absorption is useless waste, which is transferred to the large intestine and "excreted" from the anus.</p>
<p>After the nutrients are absorbed into the lacteal vessels, they must continue to be transported to all parts of the body for application. This depends on the "circulation" of the blood. The circulation of blood is caused by the heart and blood vessels. The function of the heart is like a water pump on the one hand and like a water plunger on the other hand. The two ends of the heart are connected to the arterial and venous blood vessels, and the arteries and veins are interconnected by the medium of capillaries, so the heart and blood vessels seem to have become a set of rubber tubes that communicate from end to end. Every time the heart beats, it draws the blood in the veins into the heart, and at the same time strikes the blood into the arteries. The heartbeat continues uninterrupted, so that the blood circulates and runs repeatedly in this set of rubber tubes. The lacteal vessels are also connected to this set of rubber tubes, so the nutrients it absorbs can be added to the blood from this, and then transported to all parts of the body following the circulation of the blood.</p>
<p>Since all parts of the body have coal delivered, they must be lit to burn. This step is completed by "breathing." We all know that combustion requires the presence of oxygen. The air we inhale from the mouth and nose contains sufficient oxygen. After passing through the trachea and bronchi to the lungs, oxygen runs into the blood in the lungs, and then follows the arterial blood to all parts of the body, burning the nutrients received by each part and generating heat and energy. The carbon dioxide produced by all parts of the body is transported to the heart by venous blood, from the heart to the lungs, and then exhaled through the bronchi and trachea in the mouth and nose. In this way, we can understand that nutrients are absorbed from the intestines into the blood, and oxygen enters the blood from the lungs. Both are transported to all parts of the body by arterial blood vessels.</p>
<p>However, after the coal is burned, in addition to smoke, there is also coal slag. Moreover, since there is force, water vapor must also be produced. The residual liquid remaining after the nutrients in the body are burned is mostly transported by the blood to the excretory organs—the kidneys, and "excreted" in the urine.</p>
<h3>Do Not Avoid Thorough Understanding When Reading</h3>
<p>— Qiji</p>
<p>In the way of learning, the least that can be relaxed is the word "ask," that is, to have a "smash the pot and ask to the end" spirit, requiring a thorough explanation everywhere, and not letting it be unclear casually. However, for some reason, that Jin Dynasty scholar Tao Yuanming unexpectedly put down these two famous sentences in his biography of Mr. Five Willows: "He likes to read, but does not seek thorough understanding." In the Qing Dynasty, that Mr. Yuan Zicai seemed to be afraid that the meaning of the sentence would be forgotten, and he made two more poems, saying that he himself had a habit of "not answering before the guest arrives, but loving to read books and forgetting them after reading them." Young students were originally diligent and tireless, and when they encountered difficult problems, they always thought carefully and traced the reasons. After reading these few sentences, they couldn't help but doubt, thinking that the ancients read books with this leisurely and relaxed attitude.</p>
<p>The most feared thing when reading ancient books is to take things out of context, which is most likely to lead to misunderstanding. In the biography of Mr. Five Willows, after "He likes to read, but does not seek thorough understanding," is "Whenever he has an understanding, he is so happy that he forgets to eat." If Mr. Tao really did not seek thorough understanding when reading books, how could he have read out such good taste, to the point of forgetting to eat? Furthermore, let's talk about Yuan Zicai. Not to mention anything else, his *Suiyuan Complete Works* alone is vast enough to be amazing. If he really forgot everything after reading the books, could he have written so many poems and articles? From this, it can be seen that what they call not seeking thorough understanding and loving to read books and forgetting them after reading them is nothing more than expressing their leisure.</p>
<p>Not only is it impossible not to seek thorough understanding when reading, but it should be sought thoroughly everywhere. When encountering difficult places, it is necessary to trace the source and trace the flow, investigate the root and explore the bottom, and do not be afraid to ask more questions. Ask people who are more advanced than yourself, and people who are about the same level as yourself may also exchange ideas with each other, and strive to understand it thoroughly from beginning to end. Only in this way will you naturally feel interested in what is said in the book, and he will not be willing to let go if you tell him not to read it. When Zeng Wenzhenggong talked about reading and memorizing, he had these few words: "...If you really understand it clearly, you will definitely get some taste after a long time. If there is a pleasant state in your heart, then you will slightly remember it." Zheng Banqiao also said, "Reading books with the ability to recite them after reading them is the most useless thing. The eyes are clear, the heart is negligent, the square inch is not much, and the coming and going are too busy, like watching a beautiful woman in the arena, passing by at a glance, what does it have to do with me?" He also said, "If there is a difficult place, extract it on another piece of paper and ask the teacher for an explanation." This method of extracting difficult places in order to ask people for an explanation is very worthy of our imitation.</p>
<h3>The Way to Make Friends</h3>
<p>— Jianxing</p>
<p>On the 27th of last month, Mr. Gu Zhengjiang gave a speech at the Youth Association on "The Truths I Have Experienced and Am Experiencing in Life." One section was about "The Way to Make Friends." I was very touched after listening to it, and now I will write down what I remember for the reference of friends.</p>
<p>"Our country has always attached great importance to friendship. The ancients listed it as one of the five relationships, and regarded it as equally important as the relationships of "ruler and minister," "father and son," "husband and wife," and "brothers." This is the case in the East, and there is the same situation in the West. The British writer Bacon said in his essay "On Friendship": "A true friend is another self of a person." Indeed, a true friend can not only give me sympathy, understanding, and comfort in terms of mood, but also give me appreciation, encouragement, and help in terms of career."</p>
<p>Since friends are so important, why are so many people unable to make friends? Regarding this question, Mr. Gu's answer is: "Of course, the reasons are very complicated, but the biggest reason is probably because you are too selfish. You must know that a person who only cares about himself and does not care about others, only knows how to enjoy and does not know how to contribute, and only seeks to obtain and does not think about giving, although he yearns for friends in his heart, friends will never condescend to him."</p>
<p>It is certainly best to make friends and understand the way to make friends, but in some cases, the method is also useless. Here, Mr. Gu presented a fact. "I remember when I was studying at the university, there was a foreign student who was eccentric and no one wanted to befriend him. One day he participated in a speech competition, and the topic was "Friendship." He said: "When I was in elementary school, I had many friends; when I was in middle school, I had several friends; now that I am in college, I don't even have one friend! "Although he did not say why it is becoming increasingly difficult to make friends, in fact, it is indeed much more difficult for adults to make friends than for children."</p>
<p>"Friendship and age are certainly very related, but the most important relationship is a person's own attitude towards friends. Because a person's attitude towards others can determine their attitude towards you. I remember when I first entered college, there was a period when I saw that my classmates all had long faces towards me. At that time, I couldn't figure out why. One day, when I was putting on my clothes in front of the dressing mirror, I suddenly looked up and saw that my own face was originally long!" At this point, the audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"Confucius said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Jesus said: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." Anyone who wants to make friends should give some thought and research to these two admonitions." Mr. Gu used these two sentences as the conclusion of the "Way to Make Friends" for the saints.</p>
<h3>"Nothing Much"</h3>
<p>— Shixin</p>
<p>The old cloth-clad man Zhang Yunlao opens his mouth to "the common people," Mr. Takemoto of the Mainland News speaks of "the poor commoners," and Brother Kuai Qing says everywhere "I am a Taiwanese." These three things seem like "nothing much." But if you think about it carefully, it seems that there is a bit of "something" inside. The Chinese common people seem to have no power at all in politics, but strangely, whoever cannot grasp the common people cannot maintain his regime! In the midst of war, the common people have the greatest effect on the country. The support or opposition of the common people can determine the rise and fall of the country. In the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, there are a dozen or so ethnic groups of all sizes. How to solve these ethnic issues is closely related to the victory or defeat of the war.</p>
<p>Isn't the key to the Greater East Asia problem condensed in these three "nothing much" things!</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xinbo</p>
<p>Yu Xiezhou and Yang Zijie simultaneously called out "Third Miss," and Yu Xiezhou also stood up a little from his chair.</p>
<p>She called out to them and walked to Huang Chong'an. Everyone was very excited, paying attention to her every move with spirit. They, including her father, felt that she was far superior to her two sisters. She had the strength of her eldest sister, but also the gentleness of her second sister. At the same time, he did not have the impatience of her eldest sister or the timidity of her second sister. Her appearance was like a bright moon in spring or autumn, rising on the eastern mountain, illuminating every dark corner, making people feel a burst of inexplicable joy.</p>
<p>"Daddy," she called out, and sat down on a small table next to the heated brick bed. Her face turned around, facing the lamp on the relief table. In Genming's eyes, it was just a piece of brilliance, indistinguishable from the lamplight and the radiant face. The smoke from the cigarette was gone, and the water vapor in the copper kettle was gone, leaving only the faint smoke from the water pipe, unable to cover these lights.</p>
<p>"Youmei, thanks to you, otherwise,..." The rest of the words and water smoke were swallowed into the belly.</p>
<p>"Daddy, I said that next year I must send my younger brother to school to study."</p>
<p>"Third Miss, your father has already told Mr. Yu and me about this," Yang Zijie said, taking credit, "He will enter Mr. Duzhou's school next year. Mr. Duzhou's discipline has always been very strict."</p>
<p>"I also know Mr. Duzhou's discipline," Youmei glanced at Yu Duzhou. Yu Duzhou quickly sat up straight, straightening his back. "However, I think it's best for my younger brother to live in a school with a lot of classmates, then all his bad temper will change."</p>
<p>"Third Miss," Yang Zijie said excitedly, stroking his beard, "I'm not trying to criticize you; but I think that living in school will probably learn a lot of bad temperaments, it's better to live at home. What's more, the new-style schools are not as good as the old-style private schools..."</p>
<p>"Mr. Yang, how do you know..." she said eloquently for a while. (8) Social Services</p>
<h3>"Teacher, Sign Me Up!" Please Listen to the Voices of Out-of-School Children</h3>
<p>— Jingyuan</p>
<p>Gathering a few comrades to create the "Daji Volunteer Night School," seeing countless out-of-school children wandering the streets, with a desire to seek progress, begging to enroll like a spring. I really feel that our achievements have exceeded our expectations. After the enrollment work was completed, we divided the more than two hundred suffering children into four classes according to their grades. Because of our economic poverty and lack of assistance from powerful people, we can only use the complex teaching method. We also set up a literacy class for children who are of school age but cannot enroll due to poor family conditions. Because our target is the children of workers, our school is located in the factory area with chimneys, using an elementary school for classes. After the school started, every day, there were always several out-of-school children in an endless stream, holding a one-yuan bill (completely no tuition or miscellaneous fees, only a one-yuan deposit is charged, which is still returned if the class is missed for less than two weeks), asking the teachers of the school sincerely and sadly: "Teacher, sign me up!" Because the classrooms were already full, with a hard heart, we politely refused each child who hoped to learn, watching them walk despondently outside the school gate with tears in their eyes. We, a group of educators, could only feel that this cruel society's treatment of countless out-of-school children was really too bad. We believe that after sowing and cultivating, there will be a harvest: working diligently and persistently will definitely achieve our expected ideal—every child enjoys their rights, and receives education in morality, intelligence, physique, and social skills under a rationalized education system. At the same time, we also hope that people of insight in the society can deeply understand our attitude towards running the school and fully understand the importance of compulsory education, and can sincerely give us sympathy, guidance, and economic assistance! (The Daji Volunteer Night School has six levels, from high elementary school to low elementary school. Tuition and fees are completely free. Classes are held from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm. Classes in the fifth and sixth grades still have vacancies. (Address: Peichu Elementary School, 468 Xiaoshadu Road, Haifang Road.))</p>
<h3>Qiu Zhi Volunteer School Opens</h3>
<p>Qiu Zhi Volunteer School, the main school is located in Shixue Elementary School, Lane 460, Aiwenyi Road, and the branch school is located in Gusheng Elementary School, Deqingli, Muerming Road. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are free, and books are provided by the school. The level is from the first grade to the sixth grade of elementary school. The main school has already started classes, and the branch school still has vacancies. Register as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The survey of the various public schools established by the city party headquarters this semester is as follows: First School, Shiqu Elementary School in Ganxingfang, Binlang Road.
