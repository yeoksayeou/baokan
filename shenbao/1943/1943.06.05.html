<h3 id="c1">男女同校利弊問題的再檢討 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今天提出這個「男女同校利弊的再檢討」的問題，因爲現在的大中小學，都已經是男女同校了，當然認爲男女同校是有利無弊的。所以，我們提出這問題，不待說出孰利孰弊之先，看了題目，也許有人說，或許大多數人要說是極不合時宜的，甚且有人說我們在反潮流，開倒車，回復封建思想，摧殘男女平等的話。不過，一切事物，從理論騐證到事實，每每因爲環境條件的差異，得不到同樣的理論所推斷之結果。因此，男女同校極端有利的理論，因着環境條件的不相配合，就很可能得到不如推斷所盡利的結果。換句話說，就是男女同校制度，並不極端的有利，而還有弊之所在，至少在中國，尤其具有特殊社會形態的上海。</p>
<p>男女同校制度，在十九世紀中葉，創始於北美而盛行。其後風氣漸及於世界各國。據吳叔班女士（美國歐海歐州立大學敎育哲學博士）解說：「男女同學，所以能行於北美而無阻者，蓋有三要素焉；新立共和，缺少古風遺浴。一也：「德謨克拉西」思想之發達，喚起婦女覺悟之心。二也；工業革命，科學發達，國家富庶，人人可有受敎育之機會。三也。以此三大原因，故能祛前古之遺俗，闢敎育之新途徑，而開男女合校之風焉。施行以來，頗收其效。而所謂其弊者，以改良學校設備，敎學方法，及種種活動而去之。故其結果，提高靑年男女間之道德，明瞭人生之責任，互相敬重，互相砥礪，對於身心品學，均有莫大之裨益。」準此而言，男女同學之利，發展至「明瞭人生之責任，互相敬重，互相砥礪」，已至高峯，而其能行之有效者，在乎上述之三大原因。</p>
<p>回顧我國仿行男女同校制度，亦已有年，是否達到「互相敬重，互相砥礪」之境地，而「提高靑年男女間之道德，明瞭人生之責任」。如果未曾達到這境地，甚且所得的爲相反的境地，那末，是否中國社會環境，不同於北美，而未具備上述成功的三大原因。這個問題我們知之不深，還是讓學校當局以及男女同校的靑年們來解答。</p>
<p>上海一地，爲國內中等學校最多的地方，而中等學校的男女同學，爲最易發生利弊的問題。我們近來時常得到男女家長對此問題的函件，母髯說是一致的表示遺憾。有的說兒子神思恍惚，不致力於學業，偕看電影，同上跳舞，私取家中錢物，夾袋中常見異性照片，與肉麻情書，到學期終了，成績報吿單都不及格等等。有的說女兒愛好修飾，塗脂抹粉，行動異常，規戒不效，滿口自由，侈談戀愛等等。誰無兒女，孰不望成，爲父母者，期望於男女同校者，當在「互相敬重，互相砥礪，而提高靑年男女間之道德，明瞭人生之責任」。如果因男女同校之機會，侈言自由，妄談戀愛，不於學業上求進修，而藉作角逐塲所，流弊所屆，不但爲父母者以子女進男女同校爲戒，而敎育前途，亦將蒙其影響。我們雖不能遽謂此種現象，爲一般的普遍，但也不能忽視此事實的發展。</p>
<p>上海的社會形態，不必諱言的是奢糜放浪的陷阱，隨處皆是，容易引誘意志薄弱的靑年墮落，雖可說靑年男女不必因爲男女同校而妄談戀愛，即社會上也隨處可有陷入墮落的機會。但是，我們要承認因男女同學的內在關係，假藉這種社會環境，就更容易妄談戀愛。所以，靑年男女不務學業，而妄談戀愛，雖非男女同校絕對的弊，但也不能說絕無關係了。也就是說，男女同校極端有利的理論，因着環境條件的不相配合，就很可能得到不如推斷所盡利的結果。</p>
<p>男女同校制度，在中國是不是絕對適合？這制度的有利的全部理論，至少涉及敎育學，社會學，心理學等內容，我們坦白的說，對此沒有深刻硏究，不敢肯定的論斷。不過，我們所可聽到見到的現實，在目前上海的社會環境中，男女同校，母髯說是有着弊過於利的事實。我們並不因此而作特殊的主張，說要根本廢除男女同校制度，以及男女同校絕對的有弊論。但是，我們誠懇的提出這問題，盼望敎育當局與學校當局，尤其是負訓育責任的敎師，嚴密注意事實的發展，而共同商討補救的辦法。</p>
<p>最後，我們乘這機會敬告一般中學大學男女同校的靑年同學們，國家正在死中求生，將來正待諸位作中流的砥柱，復興的中堅，責任是何等重大。進修學業，努力儲才，同學之間，互相敬重，互相砥礪，重理智，抑情感，慰父母，報國家。這才是唯一的大道。</p>

<p>南京四日中央社電　友邦日本於五日在東京日比谷公園舉行山本元帥國葬大典，日本駐華海軍武官前田少將，對日本國民發表談話如下：本日爲山本元帥國葬之期，我人回顧元帥生前卓拔稀世之才幹，赫赫不朽之武勳，衷心痛惜，不勝敬悼，同時本人因受山本元帥生前種種知　，尤覺無限感慨。山本元帥生前即給與前綫將兵及後方國民以强力信仰之感，敵人則亦因畏懽此名將而胆寒心驚，今戰局愈進展，國民對元帥之信賴益深，尤其當此大戰下海軍中無一不知山本司令長官之威名者，恰爲日俄戰爭東鄉司令長官之同享盛名，惜於戰爭半途，喪此名將，但戰死陣前，壯烈無比，若元帥者，亦即武人無上光榮，元帥雖爲國犧牲，而今而後，元帥英魂將深印一億日本國民心際。山本元帥雖只一人犧牲，但因此犧牲，而生一億之山本魂，所謂持久戰者，亦即靈魂戰，日本國民均保有捨生報國精神，以從事大東亞戰爭，是故能攻無不克，戰無不勝，發揮日本鬨民傳統精神及國民愛國心，將士作戰精神。於山本元帥戰死以至屐近阿圖島日軍壯烈犧牲，均屬顯著一例。憶日俄戰時，東鄉元帥會云，彼人有所謂名譽投降，實欲蓋彌彰，我國軍人遇任何艱境，決無將名譽與投降兩詞，混爲一談者，不勝利即犧牲，此爲我軍人應恪遵守者，捨此決無他途，阿圖島非無路可遁，但惟有如此犧牲，始能將日軍眞髓發揮無餘，我人於此大時代下，冠絕全球之大和魂，巳到處放射出燦然光芒，因一億國民全部奮起，必勝信念愈益堅强，山本元帥雖死，其忠魂仍無時無刻不關心戰塲與我人，元帥於生前指揮之精神及壯烈犧牲之果敢，此皆平素修養所成，我國民均應銘記，當此國葬元帥之際，尤應效法元帥忠勇，繼續努力。</p>

<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據莫斯科消息稱：德軍三日突在莫斯科西北方之加里寗地區開始大攻勢，經激戰結果，已突破蘇軍陣地。又蘇軍於庫斯克地區曾發動局部攻勢，中南部戰事亦極活躍。</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　蘇眾爲奪回庫班橋頭堡，畫夜與德軍展開激戰，蘇軍進攻目標，仍爲庫爾伊妙斯克地區，對該地至摩爾達亞斯克之狹隘地域，尤爲志在必得。三日晨蘇强力步兵部隊復由坦克車，大砲及空軍等掩護下，企圖突破德軍陣地，德軍當即予以反擊，終將共企圖粉碎。此外，蘇坦克車雖有十五輛突破德軍前綫陣地，然終被德軍包圍予以擊減。據德軍當局稱，庫班地區之蘇軍，連日雖蒙受重大損害，並未停止攻擊，蘇軍急欲奪取該地區者，乃因鑑於將來大作戰展開後，該地頗有形成蘇軍弱點之可能。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城四日中央社電據康白拉來電，澳首相寇丁三日就日軍之威脅說明如次：因反軸心軍向來注重歐洲戰綫及宣傳方法錯誤之結果，致反軸心國人均誤認日本人爲無能之弱國國民，對日軍已佔領廣大之土域茫然不知。今後反軸心軍倘仍專心致力於歐洲戰錢，則將使日軍於廣大之地域上確立絕對不敗之態勢，必致反軸心軍陷於極度危險。又西南太平洋反軸心軍司令官白萊米亦曾力戒澳人勿再聽信美國之宣傳，或對太平洋戰爭之前途過於樂觀，彼謂，因日軍於澳洲方面太平洋防綫之外廓，增派兵力，搆築鞏固之基地，如過小評價，日軍之戰力，實屬危險，即欲奪回新幾內亞島，反軸心軍亦須覺悟必須經過長期而困難之戰鬥。</p>

<p>（柏林可兒特派員二十八日發）德義空軍自突尼西亞撤退後，非洲戰綫的情况已不再出現於德軍當局每日發表的戰報中。東部戰綫近來亦祇有前哨戰，局部戰，及後方兵站綫的轟炸等，德蘇雙方都　劍拔弩張，彎弓待發。因而目前的興味又集中到西部方面的空中戰。而英美取攻勢，德國取守勢的空戰形勢，或許要有所變更吧！</p>
<p>不可忽視的英美空軍</p>
<p>英美空軍的盲炸德國，在本年開始。接一述二的在西部工業地帶，德國北部海岸，德國主要都市作集中轟炸，在此期間，柏林在三月一日所受的轟炸是開戰以來最大的一次，德人對天空的關心，亦漸次增加起來了。敵機的擊墜數，少則十五至二十架，多至三十架，如其說其擊墜率是百分之五至十，那末至少每日有敵機二百架至五百架來轟炸德國及其西部　領土的各都市，所以英美的空軍勢力殊難忽視。降落在德國本土的敵方炸彈量，年有增加，一九四〇年每月平均二千六百噸、一九四二年四千二百噸，一九四三年二月達一萬噸。</p>
<p>轟炸所造成的損害</p>
<p>據德方發表，本年四月在德國及西部佔領地帶擊墜敵機四百八十二架，因此，可推測在四月中來襲的敵機至少有四千架至一萬架。一至五月，據所公布的每日擊落幾有三十餘架，故本月中擊墜的敵機至少將有一千架，詣而來襲的敵機推算至少將達一萬架至二萬架之多。如此，那在過去曾連續五十七日毫無間歇，猛轟倫敦，使敵機潛踪的德空軍，勢必須傾其全力以守備其國上。但德空軍的這立塲是暫時的。英國空軍以爲德國空軍在對蘇戰及北非戰中受了相當的打擊，故驟然以美國的工業力爲背景，轉取積極的攻勢。英美以爲在歐洲大陸用大兵登陸開闢第二戰綫，以减輕蘇聯的負担，今日尙感困難，故集中全力猛烈轟炸以代替第二戰綫。這空龔所加於德國的負担如何呢？對抗西部英美，轟炸的飛行士，地面工作者，高射砲隊，及其他人員合計起來需要兵力七十五萬。此外從事通信，連絡，防火，救護等工作的男女約需七十萬。爲了國內的防空，德國不得不費如許人力，這是德國不得已的負担。加以德國各他的軍需工業都市，尤以西部的軍需工業地帶，經連日來的盲炸，不無相當的損害。可是最近英美的空襲，因德方防空設備的進步；航空兵員的增加，也不能獲致如最初所舉的效果。</p>
<p>德國被英美空炸所造成的損害，據說尙不及開戰之初德空軍轟炸倫敦時所給與英國的損害之大。據英方的發表，自一九四〇年九月起的三個月間，德空軍在倫敦投下炸彈三萬六千枚，死者達一萬二千六百六十九名，英本土被毀的家屋五十萬戶，每五戶之巾有一戶被毀。比起這英國所受的損害來，德方的不能不說極爲輕微。</p>
<p>空中要塞失效了</p>
<p>英美空軍的對德空襲，今後無論如何將愈趨熾烈，德國民衆對空襲的士氣與覺悟，處處顯示其大國民的鎭　態度，這也足以證明空中戰並不是決定戰爭勝敗之決定的東西。且據英美機擊墜德機的報告，美國的四引擎重轟炸機波音B一七型（空中要塞）的威力，並不如英美所宣傳之甚，美國空軍專門家密嘉爾少將以「最近歐洲空中戰』爲題著書稱：「空中要塞及其他四引擎轟炸機的畫間轟炸機時代已成過去，德國正在用高射砲戰鬥機加強空防，空中要塞和德機在空戰中顯示二十對一的損失率，以前說空中要塞是革命的軍用機之改良的結果，現在完全與事實相反』。據最近德方的發表，英美機擊墜率最近逐漸增加，最初來襲的敵機被擊墜的僅約百分之五，最近大槪達百分之十左右。又據最近德軍常局發表，五月二十四日的陶爾特蒙轟炸中，由高射砲及夜間戰鬥機擊墜來襲的敵機約三百架中的四十四架，即約百分之十五英。美飛行員的喪失，照四月份損失飛機約四百架，五月份一千架推算起來，約達一萬人左右。這數目的補充亦是相當困難的問題。對英戰暫吿停頓，而集中全力於對蘇戰的德軍，最近　有轉向以對英空襲戰爲主力的趨向。不單加强防禦，以對抗英美機的來襲，德空軍且將積極的如往年那樣，或變本加厲的轟炸倫敦及英國本上。</p>
<p>養精蓄銳的德空軍</p>
<p>最近成爲話題的其有極大威力的新性能炸彈，將在德國的新空中攻勢中担任重要的角色。最近德空軍的攻擊倫敦，所用的攻擊機雖很少，但其破壞力則使英人爲之戰慄。所使用的炸彈，使直徑七，八百米地域內的全部建築物摧毀無遺，其威力凌駕於英軍所誇稱的四噸炸彈之上。德空軍最近且大量生產與美國的「空中要塞」相彷彿的四引擎大型轟炸機，所需要的燃料，亦經蓄積，足供本年度大作戰之用。各工廠則從西部的被轟炸地帶漸次遷移到安全地帶，積極建設新工廠。二年來在對蘇作戰中所消耗的力量，重又蓄積起來了。德空軍正以新陣容及新武器窺伺着東部戰綫的夏季形勢，準備捲土重來，重取空中大攻勢。共目標所指，究竟在東方或在西方，現在不能遽下判斷，不過爲了對抗英美的轟炸戰，重又轟炸倫敦及英國本土，似乎較多可能性。（翔譯自五月卅一日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>目日本對國家事業，自滿洲事變十載以來，日新月異，故日本國內一切組織，面目究全一新，現今已完成新國家組織，並可謂自大東亞戰爭發生後，人力物力一切組織充實異常，確立鞏固，如去年之物資統計，物價高漲僅百分之三，反觀美國內情形大異，因物價之不能平衡，最近又有六十萬工人之大罷工，而日本國內，國民上下一心，均埋頭苦幹，爲大東亞戰爭努力，同時並謀國內生產　　　以充裕力量，故對擴大生產　朝野均具此規劃之決心，此次政府決以產業法案提具議會，其要點並於本月一日先行發表，以確保南方物資及日國內一切物資，乃爲適應作戰體制而加强作戰力量，故日本更重視鐵煤輕金屬飛機船舶五項產業之發展，除上述物力總動員外，並對人力總動員同時並進，由於實施人力物力總動員，故今後戰爭，較月前深刻化，長期化，我人當確保以維持大東亞戰爭達到最後勝利，末對中國參戰諸問題發表綦詳。</p>

<p>地院首席單獨起訴</p>
<p>至此，首席檢察官沈文傑氏，遂當庭起立，對郭等三犯，單獨提起公訴，宣讀起訴書，其原文云：</p>
<p>「被吿李秀英，女，年二十六歲，通州人，住馬浪路七六六號。</p>
<p>馮泉生，男，年二十六歲，川沙人，住雷米路三十七弄一號，商。</p>
<p>郭士元，男，年三十四歲，北平人，住霞飛路四五四號</p>
<p>右被吿等因誣吿等案件，經偵查終結，認爲應予起訴。茲將犯罪事實及所犯法條述之如左：被吿李秀英，於本年四月二十八日下午三四點鐘，到誠記襪廠購買襪子，自稱預備往藝洗華衣店領取所洗馬庫呢大衣兩件，襯絨袍子一件，故先將洗衣收據藏在袋內，不知在何處遺失。翌日向洗衣店掛失，該店店員馮泉生云已被人領去，遂邀同馮泉生同往誠記襪廠指認該廠學徒彭雙龍似係領衣之人，因廠主張月波否認，於是李秀英　馮泉生向法租界捕房告訴，捕房派包探朱松成，將彭雙龍逮捕，先後由貝克利米雷訊問拷打，彭雙龍受刑不過，揑稱衣在店樓，又稱同夥張金海曾在地上拾取一紙。經原探率帶彭雙龍搜索不　，遂又將張金海拘入捕房，復由米雷非刑威逼，備受拳打脚踢，灌水灌酒諸苦，以致張金海身受重傷，當夜身死，在米雷刑訊張彭之際，被吿郭士元得馮泉生電話，趕去捕房，任米雷譒譯之後，出入偵探室中，歷半小時。據證人張月波供稱，郭士元對伊說：「張金海彭雙龍倒是老鬼，明日將解送法院。」又聞哄騙張金海彭雙龍云：你們老闆巳經承認了」等語，彭雙龍歷次指供郭士元打他二個嘴巴云云。就此事實互證參觀，則被吿李秀英之遺失洗衣收據，以及遺失地點是否在誠記襪廠，旣未能證明實在，被吿馮泉生又未認明彭雙龍爲確係冒領洗衣之人，乃相率同至捕房吿訴，遂肇成死傷之慘案，推原禍始，責有攸歸，郭士元係藝華洗衣店主，能操法語，是日趕往捕房，即担任米雷問案之譒譯，（米雷原有譒譯三人，是日並未使用），出入偵探室中（即用刑室），歷半小時之久。據被害人彭雙龍及證人張月波之陳述，顯欲使張彭二人，承認胃領屬實，使受侵佔遺失物之處分，並非單純保釋店夥馮泉生之關係。按諸事實，其屬顯明。總核被吿李秀英·馮泉生·郭士元之所爲，均犯刑法第一百六十九條第一項之罪嫌，應依上海法租界內設置中國法院之協定第四條刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項規定提起公訴。」</p>
<p>郭士元供歐打經過</p>
<p>旋傳郭士元，據供洗衣有收據有存根，憑票取衣，認票不認人，四月二十八日未在家，因供職於電車公司。二十九日爲天長節，公司中休假，與李秀英素不相識。李等來店掛失，相持會達二十分鍊，堅邀店夥前往指認，最後始由馮夥同去。飯後至友人家打牌，連接兩電話，囑往保店夥，迨趕至捕房，正在訊問中，與米雷過去並不相識，候約五六分鐘，米雷領馮夥至，囑轉問馮指認，而馮則未作肯定之指認，僅云貌似。米雷乃返身而入。渠經馮夥要求保出，遂入偵探處一小間內，擾向米雷保馮外出，目觀彭雙龍正被鄕凳上，米雷正在灌水，並操中國話，屢詢洗衣紙有否，且雙拳摩擦彭之肋部，彭即痛極狂呼，乃指張金海拾取。米雷遂將張提至凳前，先行掌頰，復以同樣方法將張綁在凳上，施行灌水時，張痛極幾至不能發聲。米雷亦屢以洗衣紙有否，相詰質，當灌水時，汪樹坐於彭之下部，而四三六號華探張桂卿則坐於張金海之下部：迨鬆綁後，張已不能起立，語亦糢糊不淸，靠壁坐地。米雷以火酒一杯，令張喝飲，稍拒米雷則在張之腹部猛擊一拳，前胸心部猛踢一脚，第二杯火酒則在强制下灌入，由汪樹等二人將張扶入另一小間。郭供至此，乃作辯護自身之論調云，張月波等所供均係虛構事實。渠在捕房前後不滿二十分鐘，彭囑以曾幫同施行毆打，純係胡說。張金海已被誣而死，對渠所供種種，顯係串供，企圖詐渠等語。</p>
<p>正擬宜告退庭時，郭及汪樹均先後申請交保，均未核准。而郭要求開釋脚鐐，幷未邀准。於是郭又供稱四月三十日晚間十時許華探在澍突來店中，送一紙條，上書電話號碼，囑撥電一談。常即致電時，孰意聽雷話者即爲米雷。米雷于電話中吿渠，張金海已身死，，不能代表作證，否則將以激烈手段對付，但時至今日，已不用不說，張之家屬及其少艾　，均步入庭上，懇求仲雪懲兇。經庭上勸論後即退去，乃正式宣告退庭云。</p>

<p>昨論經濟界與華北急賑，認爲我工商金融各界人士處境較優，手頭較　，對此慘痛的災情，更覺責無旁貸，義不容辭，所以我們在舉出目前經濟界應做的幾件事當中，首先提出各人將所有經營的工商業機關，來實行節約，以一切可省的費用，如節酒禮品等，悉數捐人華北急賑。</p>
<p>經濟界人士，尤其是居於經濟界領袖地位的人士，當然是屬於社會上有錢有物的階級，他們都是有錢可化，有物可用的，所以提倡「節約救災」，應從這般人士開始，自覺毫無疑問。</p>
<p>工商界與金融界有力人士旣爲提倡「節約救災」的重心，我們願意竭誠貢獻提倡「節約救災」的兩個合理步驟：第一，以責人之心責己，就是別人家尙未能厲行節約以前，我們自己先行節約起來，以爲別人家的表率；第二，以責己之心責人，就是自己實行節約以後，我們還得勸導別人家同樣節約，俾達聚沙成塔的願望。</p>
<p>所以，最重要的一點，還是在於經濟界領袖與社會上一般人們精誠合作，通力共籌；單靠少數有錢的人去節衣節食，以資救濟，是不够的，必須社會上所有出入於紙醉金迷化的酒樓，旅館，舞廳，妓院，賭塲的「紳士」與少爺階級，在上海工商金融各界領袖的表率與提倡之下，大發慈悲，奔相捐助，則不獨大有助於華北水深火熱中的災難同胞，亦足差以自贖其奢侈淫逸的愆咎了。惟有紳士階級才是特別應當多多捐助，亦惟有社會領袖才是特別可以號召這一類的捐助。此方，一位主持災賑的社會領袖人物，能於其主待一個花園舞廳，戲院，或咖啡館揭幕典禮的時候，登高一呼，慷慨陳詞，其收效之宏，自不待說，尤其希望他們能够利用這種機會，向娛樂場所的當局與公衆，提出切實具體的經常自動助賑辦法，因爲，自動助賑是同胞們的道德責任，尤其是娛樂界同胞們的道德資任。</p>

<h3 id="c42">悔 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 聲泉</p>
<p>人們做了違心之事。到了失敗的時候，心上起了一種反應：不該如此做，而且下次決不再做了。</p>
<p>一個人從賭塲中垂頭喪氣地走了出來、當然是輸，而且輪得精光，於是囘家後「悔」了（當然，是老實的人，先「悔」贏了不該再「打」；然而，進一步想到這許多錢可買什麽，買什麽……塲是靠此過活的……於是根本發現而「悔」了：下次不去了，第二天，他的朋友又强拉他去，沒有辦法，爲的是朋友面情，看東看西，起初是決定不「打」的，然而，忍不住了，結果呢？和昨天一般……</p>
<p>這是悔嗎？不，在現實的前而，他的意志又動搖了，這不過是一種臨時的本性發現而「悔」而已，是一種無價値的「悔」。</p>
<p>一個人到了臨死之一刻，「悔」是更多了，悔他的罪過，求生者原諒，好在都是天良話，於是孟子亦說：「人之將死，其言也善。」是有大多數的人，都　死者的行爲，凡是人死了，大都是聖賢了（或更怕死鬼來作弄？）。然而死者不過在臨死前一刹那，盡吐其「悔」，欲求內心稍安而死吧了。這種「悔」，是不可信的！如果把死者延長了十年的生命，結果，遇着不如意的事，又會引起了他做那所悔的事的。</p>
<p>這不是和前者一般嗎？不過前者是「悔」了後，現實不再來了而已。</p>
<p>世界上，不知多少人喪身失敗於非眞實的「悔」中，爲的是悔的時候，根本忘了現實。</p>
<p>所以，眞正的「悔」，是把人生的經騐創痛的路舖平了，使我們順利的向這條路走去。「悔」能修身，能指示人生之路，所以我們須「悔」。</p>
<p>然而，要不忘記現實，不能一犯再犯。</p>
<h3 id="c43">目前的郵工生活 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 譚長德</p>
<p>的確，在以前，郵局的職業，正被人們目爲『鐵飯碗』，也算是優越的職位，有不少人羨慕企求着，可是這幾年，郵局也遭了厄運，這『鐵飯碗』反比『貓飯碗』不如了。</p>
<p>現下的郵工，想將他個人每月的薪水，津貼，及米貼全部來養活家口，最低限度也不可能，撫今追昔，殊深浩嘆。</p>
<p>此次事變後，郵局最大的生命綫——包裹業務，就一落千丈，加以運輸不便，匯兌限制，開支浩大，（不是華籍職工薪津）及種種的關係，以故收入减少，而郵工靠以養活家口的薪津也大受影響。</p>
<p>到現在，我們郵工的薪水，還是事變以前的薪水，從未提高過，郵工們平均每人每月薪津，全部收入不過是六七百元，你想，這六七百元，要應付，房租，水電費，開門七件事，以及親友紅白人情，子女敎育費等等，即使最節省，也難應付，當然是入不數出的，不幸從昨年年底起，更苦了，每月發給薪津，總不是一次發淸，有時分二次，有時分三次，有時分五次，零零碎碎，每次薪津到手，祗一百數十元，不知道應買戶口米呢。還是買煤球，還是先付房租，弄　七上八下，啼笑皆非，發紛薪津的日子，又無定期，不能預算日子派用塲，有時月底發三分之一，出月五六號又發三分之一，十二三號又再發三分之一，全無定期。　憑當局的意思，可是，我們郵工苦了。但這苦還不算苦，今年四月份又起新花樣了，就是：所有華籍員工，不拘等級及性別，一律置路『在家候令」之列，分班輪流更替，每一員工於每五個月內應有一個月『在家候令』，支領薪津及米貼全部之半數，……而將犧牲之一半。補助經費支繼之局方……』換言之，即每一華籍員工，在五個月當中，要有一個月薪津打對折，只可拿一半，你想，本來的薪津，已少到極可憐了，現下還要打對折，拿一半，叫我們如何過日子，如何活下去。雖則現下，戰時生活，無論何人，應該受苦，尤其是公務人員，但是，無論如何，受苦　恐怕也要有限度吧！肚皮總要吃飽的呀……『又要馬兒好，又要馬兒不吃草』是不行的。</p>
<p>我們郵工，又不能兼職，工作有早，中，晚，三班，更番輪流，即使有了機會，也不能去做，況且兼職是觸犯郵章，查出要停職務的。</p>
<p>我們的郵工，考進局內服務之後，都以郵局爲終身職業，所有學校內功課，到而今，早已拋荒了，別的業務，全本外行，因此現下要想再改行也不能，位置也難尋覓，末了，當局若不再給我們郵工設法，我們郵工只有餓死。（不受酬）</p>
<h3 id="c44">禮貌與人生 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>有人說：『禮貌是虛飾的幌子，人們對人不妨率正隨便一些』可是，我以爲他已把『禮貌』解　錯了。『禮貌』是尊敬他人的表示，當看見一個我們所崇拜着的人物、出現在眼前時；我們會不由自主地向他致敬。否則，內心『尊敬』而外表『蔑視』。這是欺騙自已；內心『蔑視』而外表『尊敬』，這便是所謂『虛飾』了。決不可以名之爲眞正的『禮貌』。</p>
<p>對於師長應該有『禮貌』是三尺童子皆知的事，可不必贅言。但，當而則老師長老師短十分恭敬:背面則謾罵師長，這是否是禮貌？我以爲上述的所謂當面的『恭敬』其實就是『虛飾』。由此可知禮貌不僅是『外表的』而且也是『內在的』。無怪乎有人在看見上述情形時，要說『禮貌』是『虛飾』的了。</p>
<p>爲人一世，天天要與人交接；以『禮貌』對於『人生』是很關緊要的一囘事。可是，反觀　現實世界。人與人之間，是否眞有『禮貌』存在呢？我們日常所遇見的大多是虛僞，數衍，陰陽面孔……的手段。僅在眞正友誼的培植中，才能見到『禮貌』的表現。眞可謂『難能可貴』。</p>
<p>俗諺云：『禮尙往來』。可見『禮貌』是需要雙方而維持的，如果有一方不能履行尊敬他人，則禮貌便被破壞無遺。因此，我們在待人接物之時需加倍留意，如一旦疏忽便貽害無窮。</p>
<p>現實社會裏的所謂『禮貌』，僅不過是一　　人手段而已。我們應該揚　它而表現眞正的『禮貌』出來；那麽，我們短促的『人生』才會率眞坦白，光明。你說對嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c45">批評管見 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 枕琱戈</p>
<p>在這「是非混淆」的現實社會裏，批評是需要的，因爲它雖不一定能夠『撥亂反正』，至少可以別『嫌疑，明是非，定猶豫』的。</p>
<p>因爲批評是需要的，所以我們就要注意它，決不能有着何苦這樣的認眞的那同事。但，單以我們文藝的領域內來看，有幾個是負起止義的立塲。來批評呢？少極了。所有的多是個評非評的東西，不是亂罵，就是瞎捧，罵起來，罵得人家的作品半文不値，捧起來，則盡是東方的貝多芬，東方的莎士比亞，易卜生；對於批評者的任務和態度，置之腦後—說不定有一些『家』，還不知道批評的任務和態度是什麼哩！</p>
<p>批評者的任務是什麼呢？批評者是把他自己對某一作品的見解，印象，介紹給讀者，幫助讀者去了解，領悟那作品的價値底所在。因爲這種任務是重大的，所以我們希望的是正確的批評，當然完全客觀是項好，法期士曾經說過『我們決不能拋棄自己，而批評他人的作品。』但，我以爲批評任何作品，主觀是能减至最低的成份最好，雖然你不能忘掉自己，丢去自己，批評者仍得爲自己底主義，立塲來論斷和批評。</p>
<p>那末他底態度該怎樣呢？如某報某君所說：『應該嚴肅的，忠實的，不意氣用事的，』但是我以爲這是枝節的條件，它底主要的條件，就是批評者要存着被批評的作品和作者，猶如做母親的褒眨子女的態度，換句話說，批評者儘管指斥，儘管襄揚，但這些郁出自『愛』的奔放。如果批評者，果能具有這一點，什麽『嚴肅』，『忠實『』，『意氣用事』等問題，都可以不發生了。還有一點。在批評某作品的時候，我們雖不要打廳作者的岳父大人是誰，祖宗在淸朝做過幾品官，但他得了解作者的動機，環境以及經騐，尤其是學習寫作者年的作品，我們不能苛求，但亦不能『馬虎』，我們要存着一個母親的責備她底孩子一樣，四五歲時，在地上打滾可以勉强不管，在十幾歲以上就不能不管。</p>
<p>上海數點，算是管見。</p>

<p>— 季維一</p>
<p>宿命論的持有者，在中國好像很多。尋常，遇見友人問一聲：「老兄，近來怎樣？。」得意洋洋的而孔囘答你：「運氣還好，還好，託福……」。憂愁的面容囘答你：「唉！命運不濟……。把一切事物皆歸之「命也運也」的範疇裏去。他們成功了，說是命運亨通，合該成就。失敗了就說是天不幫忙，命裏註定的。一些農夫，一天到晚辛苦地耕種，而每一年却還是不能度過，他們就以爲自己命不好，沒有做官（？）的運、不能像大人先生們的逍遙快活，優哉游哉。</p>
<p>還有一些人的不二法門，是大擺其頭，與「世風日下」人心不古」的浩嘆。他們以爲世界的弄得如此」團糟，唯一原因是人心太壞」。如果能夠訓練每一個人心地和善，不幹壞事，那麽，世界便會成爲安居樂業的了。他們以爲做强盜做娼妓的都是良心不好的結果，假使他們是秉性善良的，就不會幹這種爲人鄙棄的工作了。</p>
<p>上述兩種的立論，可說異途同歸、陷於泥沼而不可昇拔。其實在批判一件事情時，一定得先想前想後，細看四周的環境，其形成的原因。其未來的趨勢，其必然的結果……許多與這事情有關的事實。農夫收成不好，也不是命運使然，爲盜賊娼妓的形成，是另外有許多原因的，決不僅是良心的好壞可以達到。譬如社會經濟的畸形發展便是原因之一</p>

<h3 id="e1">Re-Examination of the Merits and Demerits of Coeducation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The reason for raising this question of "Re-examination of the merits and demerits of coeducation" today is that coeducation is already practiced in universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Naturally, it is believed that coeducation has more advantages than disadvantages. Therefore, by raising this question, even before we point out the merits and demerits, some people, or perhaps most people, may say that it is extremely inappropriate, and even accuse us of going against the tide, turning back the clock, restoring feudal ideas, and destroying gender equality. However, everything, from theoretical verification to facts, often fails to achieve the same theoretical results due to differences in environmental conditions. Therefore, the theory that coeducation is extremely beneficial may not yield results as advantageous as predicted due to the lack of coordination with environmental conditions. In other words, the coeducation system is not extremely beneficial and still has its drawbacks, at least in China, especially in Shanghai, which has a unique social structure.</p>
<p>The coeducation system originated in North America in the mid-19th century and became popular. Subsequently, the trend gradually spread to countries around the world. According to Ms. Wu Shuban (Ph.D. in Educational Philosophy from Ohio State University in the United States), "There are three key factors why coeducation can be practiced in North America without hindrance: Firstly, the newly established republic lacks the vestiges of ancient customs; Secondly, the development of 'democracy' awakened the consciousness of women; Thirdly, the industrial revolution, the development of science, and the affluence of the country allowed everyone to have the opportunity to receive education. With these three major reasons, it was possible to eliminate the traditions of the past, open up new paths in education, and initiate the trend of coeducation. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. As for its disadvantages, they have been eliminated by improving school facilities, teaching methods, and various activities. As a result, it enhances the morality of young men and women, clarifies the responsibilities of life, promotes mutual respect and encouragement, and greatly benefits their physical and mental well-being and academic performance." Based on this, the benefits of coeducation have reached their peak, developing to the point of "clarifying the responsibilities of life, mutual respect, and mutual encouragement," and its effectiveness lies in the above-mentioned three major reasons.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's imitation of the coeducation system, it has been in place for many years. Has it reached the stage of "mutual respect and mutual encouragement," and "enhancing the morality of young men and women, and clarifying the responsibilities of life"? If this stage has not been reached, and even the opposite is achieved, then does it mean that China's social environment is different from that of North America and does not possess the three major reasons for success mentioned above? We do not have a deep understanding of this issue and will leave it to the school authorities and the young people in coeducation to answer.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the place with the most secondary schools in the country, and the problems of coeducation are most likely to occur in secondary schools. Recently, we often receive letters from parents of both boys and girls regarding this issue, and their expressions of regret are unanimous. Some say that their sons are distracted and do not focus on their studies, go to movies and dances with girls, secretly take money from home, often have photos of the opposite sex and corny love letters in their pockets, and fail their report cards at the end of the semester. Some say that their daughters love to dress up, wear makeup, act strangely, are immune to discipline, talk about freedom, and indulge in love, etc. Who doesn't have children, and who doesn't want them to succeed? As parents, their expectations for coeducation lie in "mutual respect and mutual encouragement, enhancing the morality of young men and women, and clarifying the responsibilities of life." If, because of the opportunity of coeducation, they talk excessively about freedom, indulge in reckless love, do not seek advancement in their studies, but use it as a competitive arena, the drawbacks will not only make parents wary of sending their children to coeducation, but will also affect the future of education. Although we cannot immediately say that this phenomenon is general and widespread, we cannot ignore the development of this fact.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Shanghai's social structure is a trap of extravagance and debauchery, which is everywhere and easily lures youths with weak wills to fall. Although it can be said that young men and women do not necessarily indulge in reckless love because of coeducation, as there are opportunities to fall everywhere in society. However, we must admit that due to the inherent relationship between male and female students, it is easier to indulge in reckless love by taking advantage of this social environment. Therefore, the fact that young men and women do not focus on their studies but indulge in reckless love is not an absolute drawback of coeducation, but it cannot be said that there is absolutely no relationship. In other words, the extremely favorable theory of coeducation may not yield results as advantageous as predicted due to the lack of coordination with environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Is the coeducation system absolutely suitable in China? The entire theory of its benefits involves at least the content of education, sociology, and psychology. We frankly say that we do not have in-depth research on this and dare not make a definitive conclusion. However, the reality we can hear and see is that in the current social environment of Shanghai, coeducation is, in most people's opinions, a fact that has more disadvantages than advantages. We do not make any special claims because of this, such as fundamentally abolishing the coeducation system, or that coeducation is absolutely disadvantageous. However, we sincerely raise this question, hoping that the education authorities and school authorities, especially teachers responsible for discipline, will pay close attention to the development of the facts and jointly discuss remedial measures.</p>
<p>Finally, we take this opportunity to sincerely advise the young students in coeducation in middle schools and universities: The country is seeking survival from death, and the future depends on you to be the pillars in the torrent and the backbone of revival. The responsibility is of utmost importance. Pursue your studies, work hard to accumulate talent, respect and encourage each other, value reason and suppress emotions, comfort your parents, and repay the country. This is the only great path.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to express condolences to Marshal Yamamoto of Japan, the Axis powers broadcast eulogies from their respective radio stations at 9 p.m. on the 4th. In order, the broadcast was first delivered by Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo, followed by President Wang, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of China, Prime Minister Pibulsonggram of Thailand, and representatives of other countries in Greater East Asia. Subsequently, Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Karl Dönitz of Germany and Deputy Secretary of the Navy Count Emilio Barbarich of Italy broadcast their messages, concluding around 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto, Admiral of the Japanese Navy, died heroically in defense of East Asia. The Japanese government has posthumously granted him a state funeral, which will be held in Tokyo today (5th). Our government, recognizing Yamamoto's contributions to East Asia, has not only awarded him a special-class medal but also had the President of the Executive Yuan broadcast a eulogy on the 4th. The original text is recorded as follows: "Our friendly nation Japan is holding a state funeral for Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, who died heroically on the front lines. Our government and people, standing on the same front, mourn this unparalleled hero for East Asia and, at the same time, feel boundless hope for the future of the Greater East Asia War. We feel that having such a great figure standing on the front lines, eternally commanding and encouraging the emerging East Asian comrades to advance courageously, the Greater East Asia War will surely receive the guarantee of victory and achieve its goal. In addition to mourning, we are also overwhelmed with excitement. The Japanese Navy has long been the Great Wall at sea in East Asia. For a century, the continuous attacks by Britain and the United States towards East Asia have been blocked by this Great Wall at sea. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Japanese Navy displayed its bravery, shattered the U.S. naval base attacking East Asia at Pearl Harbor, and swept away the British fleet attacking East Asia near Singapore. As for the remnants across the East Pacific, South Seas, and even the Indian Ocean, the power of Britain and the United States was like fallen leaves meeting the autumn wind. The Japanese Navy, in cooperation with the Army and Air Force, laid the foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Marshal Yamamoto was the one in the Japanese Navy who assumed the highest command mission and established world-shaking achievements. His glory is the glory of Greater East Asia and is as immortal as heaven and earth. What is even more admirable is that Marshal Yamamoto, in the position of Commander-in-Chief, boarded a plane to go to the front lines and command operations, and was killed by enemy fire while calm. This spirit has further increased the admiration of the East Asian comrades. Recently, the isolated troops on Attu Island resisted ten times their number, and after killing and wounding many enemies, all died for their country without a single survivor, demonstrating the same spirit of Japanese generals and soldiers, and the same spirit of the Japanese Navy, Army, and Air Force. This spirit is what the East Asian nations must follow in order to win this war. Our country has already participated in the Greater East Asia War and has gone from sharing weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan to sharing life and death. Our government and people have long been determined to exert all their efforts for the Greater East Asia War. While reverently mourning Marshal Yamamoto, we wish to reaffirm this determination and continue Marshal Yamamoto's immortal spirit in order to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War."</p>

<p>Statement by Naval Attaché Maeda</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Our friendly nation Japan will hold a grand state funeral for Marshal Yamamoto at Hibiya Park in Tokyo on the 5th. Rear Admiral Maeda, Japanese Naval Attaché to China, issued the following statement to the Japanese people: "Today is the day of Marshal Yamamoto's state funeral. As we recall Marshal Yamamoto's outstanding and unparalleled talent and his illustrious and immortal military achievements, we are filled with heartfelt sorrow and respect. At the same time, I personally feel infinitely moved by the various kindnesses I received from Marshal Yamamoto during his lifetime. Marshal Yamamoto gave the soldiers at the front and the people in the rear a strong sense of faith during his lifetime, and the enemy was terrified and frightened by this famous general. Now, as the war progresses, the people's trust in the marshal has deepened. Especially during this great war, there is no one in the navy who does not know the prestige of Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, who enjoys the same fame as Commander Togo in the Russo-Japanese War. It is a pity to lose this famous general halfway through the war, but his death on the battlefield is heroic and unparalleled. As for a marshal, it is also the supreme glory of a warrior. Although the marshal sacrificed himself for the country, from now on, the marshal's heroic spirit will be deeply imprinted in the hearts of 100 million Japanese people. Although Marshal Yamamoto sacrificed only one person, this sacrifice gave birth to the souls of 100 million Yamamotos. The so-called protracted war is also a war of souls. The Japanese people all have the spirit of sacrificing themselves for the country to engage in the Greater East Asia War, so they can attack without fail and win every battle, and give full play to the Japanese people's traditional spirit and national patriotism, and the fighting spirit of the soldiers. Marshal Yamamoto's death in battle and the recent heroic sacrifice of the Japanese army on Attu Island are both prominent examples. Recalling the Russo-Japanese War, Marshal Togo said that there is a so-called honorable surrender, which is actually an attempt to cover up. Our soldiers will never confuse the words honor and surrender in any difficult situation. If we do not win, we will sacrifice ourselves. This is what our soldiers should strictly adhere to. There is no other way. There was a way to escape from Attu Island, but only by sacrificing in this way can the true essence of the Japanese army be fully displayed. In this great era, the Yamato spirit that surpasses the world has radiated brilliantly everywhere. Because 100 million people have risen up, the belief in victory has become stronger. Although Marshal Yamamoto is dead, his loyal soul is still concerned about the battlefield and us at all times. The spirit of command and the courage of heroic sacrifice during his lifetime are all the result of his usual cultivation. Our people should all remember this. On the occasion of the marshal's state funeral, we should especially learn from the marshal's loyalty and bravery and continue to work hard."</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) The German military communique stated yesterday: "The Soviet army's large gathering ground in Kursk and the Soviet army's supply centers in the areas between Belgorod and Orel were all heavily bombed by the German Air Force."</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) Thousands of German aircraft heavily bombed the key city of Kursk in the central region of the Eastern Front on the 2nd, inflicting heavy damage on the city's military supply depots, ammunition depots, barracks, and stations, turning these targets into a sea of fire, and dropping a large number of bombs on the city. This air raid by the Air Force was the largest and most effective air raid in months. A total of 78 Soviet aircraft were shot down, and only 16 German aircraft were lost.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) According to Moscow reports, German troops launched a major offensive in the Kalinin region northwest of Moscow on the 3rd. After fierce fighting, they broke through Soviet positions. In addition, the Soviet army launched a local offensive in the Kursk region, and the fighting in the central and southern regions was also extremely active.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) Soviet troops launched fierce battles with German troops day and night in order to recapture the Kuban bridgehead. The Soviet offensive target is still the Krymskaya region, especially the narrow area from this place to Moldavanskaya, which they are determined to capture. On the morning of the 3rd, Soviet strong infantry units, covered by tanks, artillery, and air force, attempted to break through German positions. The German army immediately counterattacked and eventually crushed the joint attempt. In addition, although 15 Soviet tanks broke through the German front line, they were eventually surrounded and destroyed by the German army. According to the German authorities, although the Soviet army in the Kuban region has suffered heavy losses in recent days, it has not stopped attacking. The Soviet army is eager to capture the area because it believes that it is likely to form a weakness for the Soviet army after the large-scale operations are launched in the future.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) According to a report from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that Japanese air units attacked the Anti-Axis forces' positions at Coutante, 70 kilometers northwest of Port Moresby, on the 2nd. It was also learned that Japanese air units bombed Balde near Wau on New Guinea Island, causing considerable damage.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) According to news from Melbourne today, General MacArthur's headquarters announced that Japanese aircraft flew over New Guinea again on Tuesday and bombed the area known as "Dog Kennel." Official details of the air raid have not yet been disclosed.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 4th (Central News Agency) According to a report from Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Curtin explained the threat of the Japanese army on the 3rd as follows: "As a result of the Anti-Axis forces' consistent focus on the European front and the errors in propaganda methods, the people of the Anti-Axis countries have mistakenly regarded the Japanese as incompetent and weak. They are unaware of the vast territory occupied by the Japanese army. If the Anti-Axis forces continue to focus on the European front, they will enable the Japanese army to establish an absolutely invincible posture in a vast area, which will inevitably lead the Anti-Axis forces into extreme danger." In addition, General Blamey, Commander of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces, also strongly cautioned Australians not to listen to American propaganda again or be overly optimistic about the prospects of the Pacific War. He said, "Because the Japanese army has increased its forces on the outer perimeter of the Pacific defense line on the Australian side and built solid bases, it is dangerous to underestimate the Japanese army's combat power. Even if we want to recapture New Guinea Island, the Anti-Axis forces must be prepared to go through a long and difficult battle."</p>

Finally, President Abe led everyone in shouting "Banzai" three times, and the meeting concluded. A luncheon was then held, during which Prime Minister Tojo strongly emphasized the importance of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association's mission and expressed hope that all members would work together for the country. After Prime Minister Tojo's address, President Abe delivered a response, reaffirming his beliefs and declaring his determination in this decisive phase.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The National Conference of the Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Young Men's Group Leaders continued at 8:00 AM on the 4th.

<h3 id="e17">Roosevelt Issues Order - Limits Coal Miners to Return to Work - Plans to Exercise Commander-in-Chief Powers - Conscript All Coal Miners into Military Service <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News) - According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt issued an order on the 3rd to the nation's more than 500,000 striking coal miners, requiring them to return to work by the 7th of this month. Otherwise, the President is prepared to take even more severe action. It is said that the President's plan will involve exercising his powers as Commander-in-Chief during wartime and the authority under the Selective Service Act to the greatest extent possible. The possibility of employing miners in the military is currently being considered. The President's advisors believe that a show of military force would be sufficient to effectively end the strike. Chairman of the War Production Board Nelson pointed out two days ago that work at military factories has been gradually reduced due to a lack of fuel. At the same time, the House of Representatives is discussing a bill to crack down on strikes, but many amendments have been proposed, so a vote is unlikely before today. Representatives of major industries yesterday requested that complete blackout be implemented throughout the United States in cities and rural areas. They said that there is no indication that the strike will end soon, so blackout measures could extend the coal supply.</p>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 4th (Central News Agency) - As the U.S. coal mine strike enters its third day, there is no sign of a solution. It is widely expected that U.S. government authorities may use military force to suppress the striking groups. If a solution is still not reached, the final measures may be taken. Whether coercive methods will be used is unknown, but one possibility is to directly conscript all coal miners into military service, allowing them to continue working as soldiers.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News) - It was officially announced in Algiers last night that after two and a half hours of negotiations between de Gaulle and Giraud yesterday morning, an agreement was reached to establish a "National Liberation Committee" consisting of seven members. However, the issue of Giraud's status as commander-in-chief of the French rebel forces remains to be resolved. de Gaulle declared to the press last night that the new committee will be chaired by Giraud and de Gaulle, with Catroux, Massigli, Philip, Georges, and Monnet as members. Three of Giraud's senior subordinates have been dismissed: Governor-General of Morocco Noguès, Commander of the North African Air Force Mendigal, and Commander of the West African Air Force Bergeret. Catroux has been appointed to succeed Peyrouton as Governor-General of Algeria, concurrently serving as Coordinator of Islamic Affairs. The position of Governor-General of Morocco will be succeeded by former High Commissioner of Syria Puaux. The positions of Commander of the North African Air Force and Commander of the West African Air Force will be concurrently held by Pousgault. The committee will be expanded in the future to increase the number of members. According to political circles in London, judging from the selected committee members, it can be presumed that de Gaulle clearly emerged victorious in yesterday's talks.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The German Air Force Returns with Renewed Vigor <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Kehler, Berlin, 28th) - Since the withdrawal of the German-Italian Air Force from Tunisia, the situation on the African front no longer appears in the daily war reports released by the German military authorities. On the Eastern Front, there have only been skirmishes, local battles, and bombings of rear supply lines. Both Germany and the Soviet Union are on high alert, with tensions rising. Therefore, current interest is concentrated on the air war on the Western Front. The air war situation, in which Britain and the United States are on the offensive and Germany is on the defensive, may be about to change!</p>
<p>The British and American Air Forces Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>The indiscriminate bombing of Germany by the British and American air forces began this year. One after another, they carried out concentrated bombings of the western industrial zone, the northern German coast, and major German cities. During this period, the bombing of Berlin on March 1st was the largest since the start of the war, and the German people's concern about the skies gradually increased. The number of enemy planes shot down ranges from 15 to 20 on the low end to 30 on the high end. If the downing rate is said to be 5 to 10 percent, then at least 200 to 500 enemy planes are bombing Germany and its western territories every day. Therefore, the strength of the British and American air forces cannot be ignored. The amount of enemy bombs dropped on German soil has increased annually, averaging 2,600 tons per month in 1940, 4,200 tons in 1942, and reaching 10,000 tons in February 1943.</p>
<p>Damage Caused by Bombing</p>
<p>According to German reports, 482 enemy planes were shot down in Germany and the western occupied territories in April this year. Therefore, it can be estimated that at least 4,000 to 10,000 enemy planes attacked in April. From January to May, the daily number of enemy planes shot down, as announced, was over 30. Thus, at least 1,000 enemy planes were shot down in May, and the estimated number of enemy planes attacking reached at least 10,000 to 20,000. As such, the German Air Force, which once continuously bombed London for 57 days without interruption, causing enemy planes to disappear, must now devote all its strength to defending its own country. However, the German Air Force's current position is temporary. The British Air Force believes that the German Air Force suffered considerable blows in the war against the Soviet Union and in North Africa. Therefore, with the industrial power of the United States as its background, it has suddenly shifted to an active offensive. Britain and the United States believe that it is still difficult to open a second front on the European continent with a large landing force to reduce the burden on the Soviet Union. Therefore, they are concentrating all their efforts on heavy bombing as a substitute for the second front. What is the burden of this air offensive on Germany? To counter the British and American air forces on the Western Front, the number of pilots, ground personnel, anti-aircraft gun crews, and other personnel adds up to 750,000 troops. In addition, approximately 700,000 men and women are needed for communications, liaison, fire prevention, and rescue work. Germany has to spend so much manpower for domestic air defense, which is a burden it cannot avoid. In addition, Germany's military industrial cities, especially the military industrial zone in the west, have suffered considerable damage from the continuous indiscriminate bombing. However, the recent British and American air raids have not achieved the same effects as the initial attacks due to the progress of German air defense equipment and the increase in aviation personnel.</p>
<p>It is said that the damage caused to Germany by the British and American air raids is not as great as the damage inflicted on Britain by the German Air Force's bombing of London at the beginning of the war. According to British reports, the German Air Force dropped 36,000 bombs on London in the three months from September 1940, killing 12,669 people and destroying 500,000 homes in the British Isles, with one in five homes being destroyed. Compared to the damage suffered by Britain, the damage suffered by Germany is extremely minor.</p>
<p>The Air Fortress Has Lost Its Effectiveness</p>
<p>The British and American air raids on Germany will inevitably become more intense in the future. The morale and awareness of the German people in the face of air raids everywhere demonstrate the calm attitude of a great nation, which is enough to prove that the air war is not the decisive factor in determining the outcome of the war. Moreover, according to reports of British and American planes shot down by German planes, the power of the American Boeing B-17 four-engine heavy bomber (Air Fortress) is not as great as Britain and the United States claim. U.S. Air Force expert Major General Miguel wrote a book entitled "Recent European Air War," stating: "The era of Air Fortresses and other four-engine heavy bombers has passed. Germany is strengthening its air defenses with anti-aircraft guns and fighters. In air combat, the Air Fortress shows a loss rate of 20 to 1 against German planes. It was previously said that the Air Fortress was the result of revolutionary military aircraft improvement, but this is completely contrary to the facts." According to recent German reports, the downing rate of British and American planes has gradually increased recently. Initially, only about 5 percent of the attacking enemy planes were shot down, but recently it has reached about 10 percent. According to recent reports from the German military authorities, in the bombing of Dortmund on May 24, 44 of the approximately 300 attacking enemy planes were shot down by anti-aircraft guns and night fighters, or about 15 percent. The loss of British and American pilots, estimated at about 10,000 based on the loss of about 400 aircraft in April and 1,000 aircraft in May, is also a difficult problem to replenish. The German army, which has temporarily halted the war against Britain and concentrated all its efforts on the war against the Soviet Union, has recently shown a tendency to shift its focus back to the air war against Britain. In addition to strengthening its defenses to counter the attacks of British and American planes, the German Air Force will also actively bomb London and the British Isles as it did in the past, or even more intensely.</p>
<p>The German Air Force, Resting and Gathering Strength</p>
<p>Recently, new bombs with extremely powerful new capabilities, which have become a topic of discussion, will play an important role in the new German air offensive. Recently, the German Air Force used very few attack aircraft to attack London, but the destructive power caused the British to tremble. The bombs used destroyed all buildings within a diameter of 700 to 800 meters, surpassing the British's boasted four-ton bombs. The German Air Force has also recently begun mass-producing four-engine large bombers similar to the American "Air Fortress," and the required fuel has been accumulated, enough for major operations this year. Factories are gradually moving from the bombed areas in the west to safe areas, and new factories are being actively built. The power consumed in the war against the Soviet Union for the past two years has been accumulated again. The German Air Force is eyeing the summer situation on the Eastern Front with new formations and new weapons, preparing to return with renewed vigor and regain a major air offensive. Whether the target is in the East or the West cannot be judged at this time, but it seems more likely that it will bomb London and the British Isles again in order to counter the British and American bombing war.

<p>Drama Performance to Raise Funds</p>
<p>Colleagues from small newspapers have organized the "North China Disaster Relief Association Sponsored by Small Newspaper Colleagues" to handle North China disaster relief matters. Ten newspapers, including Shanghai Daily, Li Bao, Hai Bao, Society Daily, Oriental Daily, Ji Bao, Robin Hood, Opera Daily, Opera World, and Prosperity Daily, are the natural initiators. Thirty-two preparatory committee members, fifteen drama committee members, and twelve publicity committee members have been appointed to be responsible for handling the charity drama performance.</p>
<p>Letters from Various Sectors</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Hongquan of China Cloth Industry Bank is enthusiastic about disaster relief and has donated twice. Yesterday, we received a letter from him saying, "I have received your letter and fully understand its contents. The drought in North China has caused widespread starvation and unprecedented suffering, urgently in need of relief. Your newspaper has written articles appealing to various sectors to raise relief funds, sparing no effort, and I deeply admire your enthusiasm for public welfare and effective leadership. Upon hearing the news, my colleagues at the bank expressed deep sympathy and remitted 2,000 yuan of national currency yesterday, requesting your newspaper to transfer it. I have now received your kind instructions, and I further admire your compassion for others. I am hereby sending another 2,000 yuan of national currency, hoping to make a small contribution and fulfill your kind request." Mr. Qian Shiqing and Mr. Yuan Qiyuan are willing to auction their family's collection of calligraphy and paintings for charity. A letter reads, "A friend from the north came to Shanghai and talked about the severe disaster situation in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, where tree bark and grass roots have been eaten, and I have repeatedly seen your newspaper's fundraising for the northern disaster area. Your compassionate efforts are truly admirable. Although I am troubled by economic difficulties, everyone has a heart of compassion. I intend to auction a large center scroll of ink peonies painted by Li Di, with a limited price of 3,000 yuan, and 20 copies of "Complete Works of Shiqing," priced at 100 yuan each, totaling 2,000 yuan, and donate all the proceeds to North China disaster relief. Donors can directly obtain books and indirectly relieve disaster victims, achieving both goals. Qian Shiqing." "I recently saw in the newspaper that the disaster in North China has left the land filled with sorrowful cries, and the people are starving and waiting to be fed, a truly tragic situation. We are all of the same race, how can we bear to hear of it? Your newspaper is making every effort to appeal to the public to open their purses and help the disaster victims. I work at the post office and my income is very meager, making it difficult to fulfill my desire to help. However, I remember that my ancestors left behind a manuscript of Yun Shouping's boneless painting and a true work of Dong Qichang's calligraphy scroll. Since I do not have the means to have them properly framed and carefully preserved, I intend to entrust your newspaper with these humble items, with a minimum auction price of 2,000 yuan, and remit half of the proceeds for disaster relief, contributing a small token of my intent. I am sending this letter in advance. Yuan Qiyuan."</p>
<p>Buddhist Association Relief</p>
<p>In view of the severe disaster situation in North China, the Municipal Buddhist Association, in conjunction with temples and Buddhist Pure Land Societies, Buddhist laypersons' organizations, and other groups throughout the city, has initiated the organization of the Shanghai Buddhist Disaster Relief Association for North China, which will be established soon. It will make a significant contribution to disaster relief efforts.</p>

The current epidemic prevention authorities have heard nothing about cholera incidents. Therefore, the external rumors are unfounded. The police stations in the French Concession's Xiafei and other districts have largely announced the end of vaccination programs.

<p>The three Japanese authorities in Shanghai—Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs—in order to focus on regular reports, specially held a joint reception for the Chinese press corps of this city, starting yesterday (the 4th). It was held at 5:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. First, Hirota, the Information Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech on the significance of the three-day extraordinary Diet session to be held on the 15th of this month, and the connection between China's participation in the war and Sino-Japanese cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Subsequently, spokespersons from the Army and Navy authorities gave brief reports one after another, and it was not until 7:30 PM that the meeting concluded.</p>
<p>Hirota's Speech: At the regular meeting of the joint reception held yesterday afternoon by the three Japanese authorities in Shanghai—Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs—for the Chinese press corps of this city, Hirota, the Information Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, spoke on the significance of the extraordinary Diet session to be convened by the Japanese government on the 15th of this month, stating in brief: The Japanese government will hold a three-day extraordinary Diet session starting on the 15th of this month. At this stage of certain victory in the Greater East Asia War, this 82nd session is particularly significant in two respects: first, in order to complete this war, a policy of thoroughly leading the war effort will be further pursued; second, in order to implement the above work, the Japanese domestic system will be streamlined during this period.</p>
<p>Utilizing Resources: He also stated that regarding the policy of leading the war effort, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War a year ago, the results of the operations during this period have established Japan's position of certain victory and invincibility. Determined to suppress the Anglo-Americans and transform Greater East Asia, Japan is sparing no effort in the construction of Greater East Asia. Currently, the operational areas are progressing in all directions, east, south, west, and north, covering an area of several thousand kilometers. At the same time, Japan is ensuring that Southern resources can be utilized, possessing truly immense operational power. Therefore, this kind of work and implementation of utilizing resources is a large-scale undertaking, or in other words, a large-scale industry. Since last year, Japan has been striving for comprehensive increased production. Therefore, although the Greater East Asia War has been ongoing for a year and a half, further reorganization of industrial issues will be necessary in the future.</p>
<p>Expanding Production</p>
<p>Currently, Japan's national endeavors have been changing rapidly since the Manchurian Incident ten years ago. Therefore, all organizations within Japan have been completely renewed. Now, a new national organization has been completed, and it can be said that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all organizations of manpower and material resources have been extraordinarily enriched, established, and consolidated. For example, according to last year's material statistics, commodity prices rose by only 3%, while the situation in the United States is very different. Due to the imbalance of commodity prices, there has recently been a major strike by 600,000 workers. In Japan, the people, from top to bottom, are united in their efforts, burying themselves in hard work to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, they are planning domestic production in order to enrich their strength. Therefore, the government and the public are determined to expand production. This time, the government has decided to submit an industrial bill to the Diet, the main points of which were first announced on the 1st of this month, in order to ensure Southern resources and all domestic resources of Japan, so as to strengthen the operational power to adapt to the operational system. Therefore, Japan attaches even greater importance to the development of five industries: iron, coal, light metals, aircraft, and ships. In addition to the above-mentioned total mobilization of material resources, the total mobilization of manpower is also being carried out simultaneously. Due to the implementation of the total mobilization of manpower and material resources, the war will become more profound and prolonged than before. We must ensure that we maintain the Greater East Asia War until final victory. Finally, he spoke in great detail on the issues of China's participation in the war.</p>

The original 60% of the active deposit reserve used as substitutes will continue to be handled according to the established plan. This was immediately communicated to Vice President Qian of the bank, who has since replied with his consent. The interest rate on these bonds is 4.5% per week, deducted in advance at the time of purchase. This is to notify you separately and to attach a copy of the bond regulations for your reference.

<p>Before the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, gunny sacks were strictly controlled by the Japanese authorities. After the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and the lifting of the daily authorities' control, the gunny sacks in this city were again controlled and manipulated by a few hoarders who bought and hoarded them, resulting in continuous price increases. Recently, the Materials Control Review Committee of the National Commercial Control Association has decided to include jute and jute products (including gunny sacks) in the list of controlled materials. The authorities, in view of the fact that gunny sacks are an important wartime material, will not allow speculative merchants to freely buy and sell or hoard them. Therefore, it is decided to actively establish a control mechanism on one hand, and on the other hand, to consider re-investigating and registering the gunny sacks stored by merchants in this city and other places, and to re-limit prices, so that those who hoard gunny sacks will have no way to use their tricks.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Summary of Market Conditions <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday morning, the dark market for unified government bonds showed mixed ups and downs. Category A and Category E both fell slightly, while Category B, Category C, and Category D saw increases.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: Yesterday morning, the retail price of gold jewelry in the city's silver shops was still sold at the limited price of two hundred yuan per tael, and the handling fee increased to two hundred yuan. Transactions within and outside the industry were not active, and prices rose slightly. The market for silver ingots remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: The cotton yarn market was slightly more active because the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, and some hoarders were eager to sell off their stock. Buyers with strength took the opportunity to drag in, so prices remained stable. The cloth market was initially stable and then firm. It was initially heard that the market was stable at the beginning of the morning, but because foreign merchants and customers had a strong appetite, the market price rose tortuously. People were very confident, and as a result, the price was generally raised, especially for Four Gentlemen broadcloth.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Trend of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stable with a firm undertone. Although there was a tight money situation, there was no shortage of investors taking advantage of the pre-holiday dip to absorb stocks, and the recent decline had been significant, so it seemed that the sellers were willing to look back. Transactions were still not active, and people from all walks of life remained dazed. The Sino-French Pharmacy in the new pharmaceutical industry was the focus of investment attention and rose the most sharply. The transaction prices of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, China-West Pharmacy, and Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory also saw higher prices. The department store industry was the most stable and firm, with the Wing On, Sun Sun, and National Goods companies all rising by only one yuan or more. Underwear was flat, and the price of Jingfu shirts and socks jumped again. There were still buyers after the afternoon close. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile also turned prosperous. Stocks such as Mayar Silk Factory, You Sheng Dyeing and Weaving, and Xin Feng Printing and Dyeing were all progressing upwards. In the public utilities industry, China Electric Power was flat and weak, and Zhabei Water and Electricity suddenly rose due to a certain household raising prices. In the cultural industry, the World Book and Business Book Bureau were stable, while the China Book Bureau fell again to Guan Nei. Nanyang Tobacco Company regained its strength; Dahua Match was flat and stagnant. Various miscellaneous stocks, such as Tongyi Trust, Zhongxing Timber, Baoan Glass, Gongxing Electrical Appliances, Jiuan Industrial, and Xinyi Real Estate, were actively traded and generally showed firmness.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Outline of the Central Reserve Bank Taking Over the Clearing of Silver Union Drafts <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank will be responsible for clearing the exchange difference of the exchange banks of the Bankers Association's Clearing House every day from June 1st, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is an excerpt from the implementation outline of the bank's receipt and handling:</p>
<p>(A) After the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee completes the exchange clearing on May 31, it will list all the remaining balances of all exchange banks' deposits, whether cash or remittances, and transfer them to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will enter them into each bank's "Exchange Clearing Account". The Joint Reserve Committee itself should also open an "Exchange Clearing Account" at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The deposits of non-exchange banks do not need to be transferred and remain at the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee. (Explanation) The funds in the current account of each exchange bank deposited in the reserve committee, whether cash or drafts, should be transferred to the Central Reserve Bank by the reserve committee according to the balance on May 31. The Central Reserve Bank will open a "Exchange Clearing Account" for each bank and issue a remittance receipt, which will be sent to each bank by the reserve committee. When each bank receives the above receipt, it should issue a transfer application based on the balance of the original current account deposited in the reserve committee as of May 31, separately stating "cash" and "drafts", and submit it to the reserve committee for safekeeping. After May 31, before each bank receives the above remittance receipt from the Central Reserve Bank, any withdrawal slips that have been issued for the original funds deposited in the reserve committee will still be accepted by the reserve committee first, and the reserve committee will add the words "Central Reserve Bank" to the heading of the withdrawal slip and send it to the Central Reserve Bank for payment. (B) From June 1st, after each day's exchange at the Clearing House is completed, a copy of the exchange difference summary statement will be sent to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will pay or receive the exchange difference for each exchange bank's "Exchange Clearing Account" according to the difference listed on the statement. (Explanation) After the exchange is completed each day, the exchange bank still needs to issue an "Exchange Difference Transfer Application" and send it to the reserve committee for verification, and then send it to the Central Reserve Bank as a transfer voucher. After the exchange bank exchanges, the returned checks will still be sent by each bank to the original presenting bank using the original "Deposit Counterparty List", and the reserve committee will stamp the counterparty list to certify it, with one copy kept for record, and the other copy sent by the returned check bank to the Central Reserve Bank to credit the corresponding amount to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. The exchange bank should issue a Central Reserve Bank check to the reserve committee to return the amount of the returned check to the exchange bank. The reserve committee will deposit the Central Reserve Bank check received from the exchange bank for the return of the amount of the returned check into the Central Reserve Bank. (C) The Central Reserve Bank may give interest to each bank's "Exchange Clearing Account". In the future, the current deposit reserve account of the exchange bank may be included in the "Exchange Clearing Account" for calculation. (D) If the deposit balance of each exchange bank is insufficient to pay the difference that the bank should pay that day due to exchange clearing, and needs to supplement funds, it can either borrow from the Central Reserve Bank, or borrow from the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee according to the usual practice, whichever is convenient for the exchange bank. (E) The Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee, up to now, handles the collection business of each bank. For those entrusted by non-exchange banks, the methods are still the same. For those entrusted by exchange banks, a Central Reserve Bank check should be issued after receiving the loan amount and handed over to the entrusting bank. On the side of the Clearing House, there should no longer be the opening of a deposit account for the exchange bank. (Explanation) If the exchange bank entrusts the reserve committee to collect the bill, temporarily use the original "Deposit Count List", and send it to the reserve committee. The reserve committee will stamp the counterparty list to certify it, with one copy kept for record, and the other copy sent by the exchange bank to the Central Reserve Bank to credit the corresponding amount to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. (F) The withdrawal slips of the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee obtained by each exchange bank will still be used temporarily, but with the heading stamp of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank added. (Explanation) After the implementation of this outline, the exchange bank will no longer issue withdrawal slips and transfer applications for the reserve committee. All Central Reserve Bank clearing account checks mentioned in the above explanations can be temporarily replaced by the above withdrawal slips with the added stamp. Exchange banks that receive this withdrawal slip, except for those directly deposited into the Central Reserve Bank, can submit it to the Central Reserve Bank for exchange within the Clearing House. (G) The various regulations of the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee regarding the exchange, clearing, and return of bills are still applicable for the time being. Matters not covered in these measures shall be handled in accordance with the articles of association of the Clearing House. (Explanation) In the future, the exchange bank's check for the Central Reserve Bank's clearing account shall still be based on the balance of the current day's funds, that is, the deposit balance at the end of the night.</p>
<h3 id="e45">The Zhang Jinhai Tragic Death Case: Court Reopens for Trial Yesterday Morning; Prosecutor's Office Indicts Guo Shiyuan and Others; Further Trial Scheduled for 9 AM on the 7th <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The case of the illegal abuse and murder of youth Zhang Jinhai by the French Concession Police, which has drawn nationwide public attention, saw the reopening of court proceedings for the Chinese suspects yesterday morning at the Second Special District Court of this city. A large number of representatives from various community organizations and the general public attended the hearing, demonstrating the broad concern across all sectors of the city regarding this case. The chief culprit, Guo Shiyuan, and two others were not prosecuted by the French Concession Police. Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie of the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, based on the results of the investigation, filed a public indictment against them independently in court. Details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Police Personnel Separately Indicted</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, Qian Sen, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, along with Judges Tang Youqi and Wang Yisheng, and Chief Clerk Li Tingfan, convened the court session with Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie. Attorney Xu Wufang, representing the French Concession Administration, presented the public indictment against four defendants from the French Concession Police: interpreter Li Hongda, Chinese Constable No. 233 Zhu Songcheng, Chinese Detective No. 417 Zai Shu, and Chinese Detective No. 436 Zhang Guiqing. The indictment stated that, following the investigation into the joint assault case, the above defendants were deemed to have assisted their superiors, Beckley (West Constable No. 23) and Mire, in the commission of violent acts (details can be found in the compiled testimonies of all witnesses). They were indicted under Article 278, Section 2 of the Criminal Code for assault. The indictment also stated that the chief culprits, Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng, would not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>District Court Chief Independently Files Indictment</p>
<p>At this point, Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie rose in court and independently filed a public indictment against the three defendants, Guo, and others, reading the indictment aloud. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Defendant Li Xiuying, female, 26 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at 766 Malan Road.</p>
<p>Feng Quansheng, male, 26 years old, from Chuansha, residing at No. 1, Lane 37, Leimi Road, merchant.</p>
<p>Guo Shiyuan, male, 34 years old, from Beiping, residing at 454 Xiafei Road.</p>
<p>The above defendants are being indicted for cases of false accusation, etc., following the conclusion of the investigation. The facts of the crime and the legal articles violated are described as follows: Defendant Li Xiuying went to Chengji Sock Factory on the afternoon of April 28th to buy socks. She claimed to be planning to collect two wool coats and a velvet robe from the Yi Xi Hua Clothing Store, so she had hidden the laundry receipt in her bag but lost it somewhere. The next day, she reported the loss to the laundry store, and the store clerk, Feng Quansheng, told her that someone had already collected the items. Subsequently, she invited Feng Quansheng to Chengji Sock Factory to identify the factory apprentice, Peng Shuanglong, as the person who had collected the clothes. Because the factory owner, Zhang Yuebo, denied this, Li Xiuying and Feng Quansheng reported the matter to the French Concession Police. The police dispatched Detective Zhu Songcheng to arrest Peng Shuanglong. Peng Shuanglong was interrogated and tortured by Beckley and Mire. Unable to withstand the torture, he falsely claimed that the clothes were in the upper floor of the store and that his accomplice, Zhang Jinhai, had picked up a piece of paper from the ground. The original detective led Peng Shuanglong to search the store but found nothing. Subsequently, Zhang Jinhai was also detained in the police station and subjected to torture and coercion by Mire, including beatings, kicking, and waterboarding, resulting in serious injuries and death that night. During Mire's interrogation and torture of Zhang and Peng, the defendant Guo Shiyuan received a phone call from Feng Quansheng and rushed to the police station. After acting as Mire's interpreter, he entered and exited the interrogation room for half an hour. According to witness Zhang Yuebo, Guo Shiyuan said to him, "Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong are old hands; they will be sent to court tomorrow." He also reportedly deceived Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong, saying, "Your boss has already admitted it." Peng Shuanglong has repeatedly testified that Guo Shiyuan slapped him twice. Based on the mutual corroboration of these facts, the fact that Defendant Li Xiuying lost the laundry receipt and whether the location of the loss was at Chengji Sock Factory have not been proven. Defendant Feng Quansheng also failed to positively identify Peng Shuanglong as the person who impersonated the laundry collector. They then went together to the police station to report the matter, leading to the tragic deaths and injuries. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the responsibility lies with them. Guo Shiyuan is the owner of Yi Hua Laundry, fluent in French. On that day, he rushed to the police station and served as Mire's interpreter during the interrogation (Mire originally had three interpreters, none of whom were used that day), entering and exiting the interrogation room (i.e., the torture room) for half an hour. According to the statements of the victims Peng Shuanglong and witness Zhang Yuebo, it is clear that he intended to make Zhang and Peng admit to the appropriation and be subjected to punishment for the lost items, and it was not simply a matter of bailing out his employee, Feng Quansheng. Judging from the facts, this is obvious. In summary, the actions of Defendants Li Xiuying, Feng Quansheng, and Guo Shiyuan constitute a criminal offense under Article 169, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, and a public indictment should be filed in accordance with Article 4 of the Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the Shanghai French Concession and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>
<p>Guo Shiyuan Testifies About the Beatings</p>
<p>Guo Shiyuan was then called to testify. He stated that the laundry had receipts and stubs, and clothes were collected based on the receipt, not the person. On April 28th, he was not at home as he worked at the tram company. The 29th was the Emperor's Birthday, and he had a holiday from the company. He did not know Li Xiuying. Li and others came to the store to report the loss and argued for about twenty minutes, strongly urging a store employee to go and identify the person. Finally, Feng went with them. After dinner, he went to a friend's house to play cards and received two phone calls, urging him to bail out the store employee. When he arrived at the police station, the interrogation was underway. He did not know Mire previously. After waiting for about five or six minutes, Mire led Feng to him and asked him to ask Feng to identify the person, but Feng did not make a positive identification, only saying he looked similar. Mire then turned around and went inside. He, at the request of Feng, entered a small room in the detective's office to ask Mire to release Feng. He saw Peng Shuanglong being held on a bench while Mire was waterboarding him, speaking in Chinese, repeatedly asking if he had the laundry receipt and rubbing Peng's ribs with his fists. Peng screamed in pain and pointed to Zhang Jinhai as the one who had picked it up. Mire then brought Zhang to the bench, slapped him first, and then tied him to the bench in the same way, administering waterboarding. Zhang was in so much pain that he could barely speak. Mire also repeatedly asked if he had the laundry receipt. While waterboarding, Wang Shu sat on Peng's lower body, and Chinese Detective No. 436 Zhang Guiqing sat on Zhang Jinhai's lower body. After being untied, Zhang was unable to stand up, his speech was unclear, and he leaned against the wall and sat on the ground. Mire ordered Zhang to drink a glass of liquor; when Zhang refused slightly, Mire punched Zhang in the stomach and kicked him in the chest. The second glass of liquor was forcibly poured down his throat, and Wang Shu and others helped Zhang into another small room. Guo, at this point, made a defense, saying that Zhang Yuebo and others' testimonies were fabricated. He was at the police station for no more than twenty minutes. Peng's claim that he helped with the beatings was pure nonsense. Zhang Jinhai had been falsely accused and died, and his testimony was clearly colluded to frame him, etc.</p>
<p>Just as the court was about to announce the adjournment, Guo and Wang Shu both applied for bail, which was not approved. Guo also requested to have his shackles removed, which was not granted. Then, Guo further testified that Chinese Detective Zai Shu suddenly came to his store at around 10 PM on April 30th and delivered a note with a phone number, urging him to call and talk. When he made the call, he realized that the person on the other end was Mire. Mire told him on the phone that Zhang Jinhai had died and that he could not testify; otherwise, he would take drastic measures. But now, he could not help but speak out. Zhang's family members, including his young wife, stepped forward in court, pleading for justice and punishment of the murderers. After the court's mediation, they withdrew, and the court formally announced the adjournment.</p>
<p>Economic Circles' Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e46">Further Discussion on Economic Circles and Emergency Relief for North China <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on economic circles and emergency relief for North China argued that people in our industrial, commercial, and financial sectors are in a relatively better position, with more resources at hand. Therefore, they feel more obliged and duty-bound towards this tragic disaster. Thus, among the several things we proposed that the economic circles should do currently, we first suggested that everyone implement frugality in all the industrial and commercial organizations they run, donating all possible savings, such as from reducing spending on alcohol and gifts, to emergency relief for North China.</p>
<p>People in economic circles, especially those in leadership positions, are undoubtedly among the wealthy and propertied classes in society. They have the money to spend and the resources to use. Therefore, promoting "frugality to aid disaster relief" should start with these people, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Since influential people in the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors are at the center of promoting "frugality to aid disaster relief," we are willing to sincerely contribute two reasonable steps for promoting "frugality to aid disaster relief": First, judge oneself with the heart of judging others, meaning that before others are able to vigorously practice frugality, we ourselves should start practicing frugality to set an example for others. Second, judge others with the heart of judging oneself, meaning that after we have practiced frugality ourselves, we must also persuade others to do the same, so as to achieve the goal of accumulating small contributions into a large sum.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most important point is still that economic leaders and the general public work together sincerely and cooperate to plan. Relying solely on a small number of wealthy people to cut back on food and clothing to provide relief is not enough. All the "gentlemen" and young masters who frequent luxurious restaurants, hotels, dance halls, brothels, and gambling dens must, under the example and promotion of leaders in Shanghai's industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, show great compassion and contribute generously. This will not only greatly help our fellow compatriots in North China who are suffering in the midst of a crisis but will also be sufficient to atone for their own extravagance and licentiousness. Only the gentleman class should contribute more, and only social leaders can particularly call for this type of contribution. In this regard, a social leader presiding over disaster relief can, at the opening ceremony of a garden dance hall, theater, or cafe, give a loud call to action and speak passionately, the effect of which need not be said. In particular, it is hoped that they can take advantage of this opportunity to propose practical and concrete methods for entertainment venues and the public to continuously and automatically aid disaster relief, because automatic aid relief is the moral responsibility of our fellow compatriots, especially the moral responsibility of our fellow compatriots in the entertainment industry.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Regret <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Shengquan</p>
<p>When people do things against their conscience, and when they fail, a reaction arises in their minds: they should not have done it that way, and they will never do it again.</p>
<p>A person walks out of a gambling den, crestfallen. Of course, he has lost, and lost everything. So, after returning home, he "regrets" it (of course, an honest person first "regrets" that he should not have continued "playing" when he was winning; but, thinking further about what he could have bought with all that money...the gambling den lives off of this...so he fundamentally discovers and "regrets" it): he will not go there next time. The next day, his friend strongly pulls him to go again. There is no way to refuse, for the sake of friendship. Looking around, he initially decides not to "play," but he cannot resist. The result? The same as yesterday...</p>
<p>Is this regret? No. In the face of reality, his will wavers again. This is just a temporary discovery of his nature and "regret," a valueless "regret."</p>
<p>A person has even more "regrets" at the moment of death. He regrets his sins, asking for forgiveness from the living. Fortunately, these are all sincere words. So, Mencius also said, "When a man is about to die, his words are good." Most people praise the behavior of the deceased; everyone who dies is mostly a sage (or, perhaps, they are afraid of being haunted by the ghost?). However, the deceased is just, in the moment before death, venting all his "regrets," seeking a little peace of mind before dying. This kind of "regret" is not to be trusted! If the life of the deceased were extended by ten years, the result would be that, encountering unpleasant things again, he would be led to do what he had regretted.</p>
<p>Isn't this the same as the former? Except that, in the former case, after "regretting," the reality does not come again.</p>
<p>In this world, I do not know how many people have lost their lives in failure because of unreal "regret," because, at the time of regret, they completely forgot reality.</p>
<p>Therefore, true "regret" is smoothing the path of life's experiences and traumas, allowing us to walk smoothly along this path. "Regret" can cultivate character and indicate the path of life, so we must "regret."</p>
<p>However, we must not forget reality, and we must not make the same mistake again and again.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Current Life of Postal Workers <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Changde</p>
<p>Indeed, in the past, the profession of postal worker was regarded as an "iron rice bowl," a superior position that many envied and sought. However, in recent years, the post office has also suffered misfortune, and this "iron rice bowl" is worse than even a "cat's rice bowl."</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is impossible for a postal worker to support his family solely with his monthly salary, allowances, and rice subsidies, even at a minimum. Looking back on the past, I deeply sigh.</p>
<p>After the recent incident, the post office's biggest lifeline—the parcel business—plummeted, coupled with inconvenient transportation, exchange restrictions, and huge expenses (not including the salaries of Chinese staff), and various other factors. As a result, income has decreased, and the salaries and allowances on which postal workers rely to support their families have been greatly affected.</p>
<p>To this day, our postal workers' salaries are still the same as before the incident and have never been increased. Postal workers earn an average of only six or seven hundred yuan per month, including salary and allowances. Think about it, these six or seven hundred yuan have to cover rent, utilities, daily necessities, family and friends' weddings and funerals, children's education, and so on. Even with the most frugal spending, it is difficult to cope, and of course, expenses exceed income. Unfortunately, since the end of last year, things have become even more difficult. Monthly salaries and allowances are never paid in full at once, sometimes paid in two installments, sometimes in three, sometimes in five, in bits and pieces. Each time a salary or allowance is received, it is only one hundred and something yuan. One does not know whether to buy rice for the family, or buy coal briquettes, or pay the rent first, causing confusion and helplessness. The dates of issuing salaries and allowances are also irregular and cannot be predicted for budgeting purposes. Sometimes one-third is issued at the end of the month, another one-third is issued on the 5th or 6th of the following month, and another one-third is issued on the 12th or 13th. There is no fixed schedule, depending entirely on the authorities' discretion. But we postal workers are suffering. But this suffering is not the worst. This April, a new trick has started: all Chinese employees, regardless of rank or gender, are placed "on standby at home" in shifts, with each employee having one month "on standby at home" every five months, receiving only half of their salary, allowances, and rice subsidies...sacrificing the other half to subsidize the bureau's expenditures... In other words, every Chinese employee has their salary halved for one month out of every five months and can only take half. Think about it, the original salary was already pitifully small, and now it is halved, how are we supposed to live, how are we supposed to survive? Although in the current wartime, everyone should suffer, especially public officials, but in any case, there must be a limit to suffering! The stomach always needs to be filled... It is impossible to "want the horse to run fast, but not want the horse to eat grass."</p>
<p>We postal workers also cannot hold other jobs. The work has three shifts: early, middle, and late, which are rotated. Even if there are opportunities, we cannot take them, and furthermore, holding another job violates postal regulations, and if discovered, we will be suspended.</p>
<p>After our postal workers pass the exam and join the bureau, they treat the post office as a lifelong career. All the knowledge from school has long been abandoned, and we are completely ignorant of other businesses. Therefore, it is now impossible to change careers, and positions are difficult to find. In the end, if the authorities do not find a way to help us postal workers, we postal workers will only starve to death (without pay).</p>
<h3 id="e49">Courtesy and Life <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Some people say, "Courtesy is a hypocritical facade; people should be straightforward and casual with others." However, I believe that he has misinterpreted "courtesy." "Courtesy" is an expression of respect for others. When we see a figure we admire appear before us, we will involuntarily pay our respects to them. Otherwise, "respecting" inwardly but "despising" outwardly is deceiving oneself; "despising" inwardly but "respecting" outwardly is what is called "hypocrisy." This absolutely cannot be called genuine "courtesy."</p>
<p>That one should have "courtesy" towards teachers and elders is something every child knows, so there is no need to elaborate. But is it courtesy to be extremely respectful in front of teachers and elders but to scold them behind their backs? I believe that the aforementioned so-called "respect" in person is actually "hypocrisy." From this, it can be seen that courtesy is not only "external" but also "internal." No wonder some people, when they see the above situation, would say that "courtesy" is "hypocritical."</p>
<p>Living in this world, one must interact with people every day; having "courtesy" towards "life" is a very important matter. However, looking back at the real world, does "courtesy" truly exist between people? What we encounter daily are mostly the hypocritical, perfunctory, two-faced...tactics. Only in the cultivation of true friendship can we see the expression of "courtesy." It can truly be called "rare and precious."</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Courtesy demands reciprocity." It can be seen that "courtesy" requires both parties to maintain it. If one party fails to show respect for others, then courtesy is completely destroyed. Therefore, we need to pay extra attention when dealing with people; if we are negligent, it will cause endless harm.</p>
<p>The so-called "courtesy" in real society is merely a tactic of humans. We should abandon it and express genuine "courtesy"; then, our short "life" will be straightforward, honest, and bright. Do you agree?</p>
<h3 id="e50">Critical Views <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Diaoge</p>
<p>In this "world of confused right and wrong," criticism is necessary because, although it may not be able to "correct the wrongs," it can at least distinguish "suspicions, clarify right and wrong, and resolve hesitations."</p>
<p>Because criticism is necessary, we must pay attention to it and never have the same casual attitude. But, looking only at our field of literature and art, how many people take a righteous position to criticize? Very few. Most of them are things that are neither criticisms nor praises, either just scolding or blindly praising. When scolding, they scold the work as worthless; when praising, they are all Eastern Beethovens, Eastern Shakespeares, Ibsens; the task and attitude of the critic are put out of their minds—perhaps some "masters" do not even know what the task and attitude of criticism are!</p>
<p>What is the task of the critic? The critic is to introduce his own views and impressions of a work to the reader, helping the reader to understand and comprehend the value of the work. Because this task is important, we hope for accurate criticism. Of course, complete objectivity is good. Faqishi once said, "We can never abandon ourselves and criticize the works of others." But, I believe that in criticizing any work, it is best to reduce the subjective component to the lowest possible level. Although you cannot forget yourself, lose yourself, the critic must still use his own doctrine and position to judge and criticize.</p>
<p>So, what should his attitude be? As a certain gentleman in a certain newspaper said, "It should be serious, honest, and not emotional." But, I believe that these are trivial conditions. Its main condition is that the critic should treat the work being criticized and the author with the attitude of a mother praising or belittling her children. In other words, the critic, no matter how much he points out flaws or how much he praises, all this comes from the outpouring of "love." If the critic can have this point, then problems such as "seriousness," "honesty," and "emotionality" will not arise. There is also one more point. When criticizing a certain work, although we should not inquire about who the author's father-in-law is or how many ranks his ancestors held in the Qing Dynasty, he must understand the author's motives, environment, and experience. Especially for the works of young learners, we cannot be too demanding, but we cannot be "careless" either. We must treat them with the attitude of a mother scolding her child. It is excusable to let them roll on the ground when they are four or five years old, but it is inexcusable to ignore it when they are over ten years old.</p>
<p>These few points from Shanghai are just my humble opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Fatalistic Human Hearts <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Weiyi</p>
<p>It seems that there are many holders of fatalism in China. Usually, when meeting a friend, one asks, "Brother, how have you been lately?" The one who is proud and happy will answer you: "My luck is good, good, thanks to you..." The one with a worried look will answer you: "Alas! Fate is not on my side..." Putting everything into the category of "fate." Those who succeed say that their fate is prosperous, and they deserve to succeed. Those who fail say that heaven is not helping them, and it is destined in their fate. Some farmers, who work hard all day long, still cannot make ends meet every year. They think that their fate is not good and that they do not have the luck to be officials (?), and cannot live as carefree and comfortable as the gentlemen.</p>
<p>There are also some people whose only way is to shake their heads and sigh about "the decline of morality" and "the hearts of people are not as they used to be." They think that the only reason the world is so "messy" is that people's hearts are too bad. If everyone could be trained to have kind hearts and not do bad things, then the world would become a place of peace and prosperity. They think that the result of robbers and prostitutes is all due to their bad conscience. If they were kind by nature, they would not do this kind of despised work.</p>
<p>The above two kinds of arguments can be said to be different paths leading to the same goal, falling into the mud and unable to rise. In fact, when criticizing a thing, one must first think back and forth, look closely at the surrounding environment, its causes, its future trends, its inevitable results... Many facts related to this matter. The poor harvest of farmers is not caused by fate. The formation of thieves and prostitutes has many other reasons, and it is not just a matter of good or bad conscience that can achieve it. For example, the abnormal development of social economy is one of the reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Mirror <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Jixian</p>
<p>This person thinks that person is ugly, and that person also thinks this person is ugly. They all think they are beautiful, but they have never seen their own faces.</p>
<p>Later, they inadvertently saw the "mirror" and discovered their true appearance; it turned out that they were both ugly.</p>
<p>I can see his shortcomings, and he can also see my shortcomings, but neither he nor I have ever seen our own shortcomings. Because we are still missing a "mirror."</p>
<p>This "mirror" is right in front of our eyes, but we have not seen it, so our shortcomings have not been discovered!</p>
<p>Everyone is bound to have shortcomings, what is regrettable is that we have not discovered them! We should accept the criticisms of others, we should deeply reflect on ourselves—that is our "mirror."</p>
<p>It is placed in front of our eyes! It is waiting for us to use it.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Starting from the Slap in the Face: Written for the Death of Female Teacher Su Yizhi <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Jun</p>
<p>One who receives a slap and responds with a smile is a slave.</p>
<p>One who is slapped and lacks the ability to retaliate is a weakling.</p>
<p>One who returns tooth for tooth and fist for fist is a true man.</p>
<p>We will not give sympathy or assistance to the first type of person. All we will bestow upon them is contempt, cold ridicule, and mockery. We will send a thorn into their spine and will never feel a twinge of sadness at the sight of their bleeding.</p>
<p>To the third type of person, there is only respect and admiration. We must sing of their greatness, worship their spirit, and even rise up and emulate their actions. This is a great sacrifice.</p>
<p>However, we give boundless pity and full sympathy to the second type of person, because they are weak. But there are two possible outcomes: one is to hold a grudge and always seek revenge; the other is "the spiritual victory of Ah Q, who says 'the son beats the father'."</p>
<p>Not long ago, we saw in the newspaper the news that a female teacher, Mr. Su Yizhi, actually died of depression after being slapped twice and cursed at by a shrewish parent. The writer believes this is a matter worthy of public outrage. Of course, advanced countries may treat this as a joke, but those who truly understand the situation in Chinese society may not? Although this is a failure in Chinese education, a small disgrace to the education community, it may also serve as a catalyst for improving our education community, a warning to society to respect teachers, and the perpetrator must be severely punished.</p>
<p>The writer is also a primary school teacher and feels quite insecure seeing this. I hope people in the community will pay attention to this and warn those who come after. In that way, although Ms. Su was sacrificed, she saved many teachers from being slapped in the future!</p>

<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Begging Fellow Chaozhou Natives to Urgently Initiate Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Amidst the major disaster in North China, it is unfortunate to receive news from many Chaozhou friends that Chaozhou is also suffering from drought. It has not rained for several months, and there is no grain harvest in the fields. In addition, there is no source of rice from Southeast Asia, so white rice has risen to 800 yuan per斗 (dou, a unit of dry measure, approx. 10 liters), (equivalent to 576 Shanghai dollars per dou). Other items, such as sweet potatoes, can only be bought for two ounces per yuan, so many victims are starving to death.</p>
<p>Taking Chaoyang County alone, there are 800 villages. Due to the high price of rice, each village has to starve to death one or two hundred people every day. Some sell their own children for food, and those girls are abandoned in the wilderness with no one to take them in.</p>
<p>No one outside knows about this panic. Those wealthy Chaozhou merchants in Shanghai, although aware of the severity of this disaster in their homeland, have not stepped forward to provide relief. If this continues, it will become the second North China. Because in Chaozhou, there are two harvests a year. The harvest in the first half of the year is virtually zero, and the harvest in the second half of the year must wait until 于月 (yuè yuè, another way of saying November), and moreover, the heavens absolutely do not send rain. I implore Chaozhou compatriots to provide relief to their hometown and not allow the disaster to expand.</p>

<p>It has been found that there are a large number of poor students in Shanghai, especially those whose parents have died or fled, and their whereabouts are unknown. Their situation is extremely difficult. In view of this, the Mutual Aid Society has entrusted this office to select 131 of these students from among the students receiving financial aid, and to subsidize their families with 30 yuan per month until the end of this year. The funds for this month have been received, and the students can come to this office to collect them as soon as they are notified.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Home Economics in Extraordinary Times <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jinying</p>
<p>Chinese women have never paid much attention to home economics. Therefore, household affairs are mostly handled by servants. An ignorant maid can manage the household, including hygiene, economy, child rearing, nutrition, and education. Therefore, there are few healthy families. An unhealthy family directly affects society and the country. Therefore, it is necessary for every woman to have sufficient knowledge of home economics. The Home Economics Research Society aims to increase women's knowledge and skills through mutual research, especially in these extraordinary times when everything is expensive. One should also be prepared for self-reliance in production. If one is without preparation, they will be able to cope and be competent. Therefore, I hope housewives will make good use of their spare time and not waste their precious time on meaningless activities. Even housewives who do not need research should join this society, because we can cooperate to create institutions that benefit society, such as schools, kindergartens, orphanages, and homes for the elderly and disabled. Our women bear a large part of the responsibility for the strength of the country, so I hope sisters, everyone quickly get up and do your part.</p>
