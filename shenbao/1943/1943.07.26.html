<p>社評</p>
<h3>論毆局</h3>
<p>歐洲戰局，始終以東綫爲主要戰塲。自七月五日以來，結束四個月的沉寂時期，開始劇烈的夏季戰爭。不過，如我們日前所指出的，德國方面，根據過去兩年作戰的經騐敎訓，已放棄長驅深入的戰略，而集中力量於對蘇軍戰鬥力之殲滅的打擊，以確保勝利，因此，最近三個星期來的劇烈戰爭中，自奥勒爾·庫爾斯克與貝爾格勒特一錢，除在若干地區作必要的推進之外，大體上並不取躍進態勢；他們所努力的是籍流動性的戰術，利用新銳的武器，特別是『虎型』坦克，予業已改取攻勢的蘇軍以嚴重打擊。現在，在德軍猛烈打擊之下，已壓迫蘇聯軍事當局採取更大規模的攻勢，也就是實現所謂『逼虎出山』的戰略，以便加以致使的打擊。自上星期以來，蘇聯方面，已從奧勒爾陣綫開始，採取全面攻勢，並且把戰綫拉開，不僅是貝爾格勒特方面，並且遠及北方的列寗格勒前綫，甚至蘇聯的一部份兵力，還企圖在挪威方面登陸，除了後者立即被軸心軍搫退之外，據二十四日中央社柏林電，自二十二日起，蘇軍於列寗格勒地方，開始大規模攻勢，於是東綫北段戰爭，又趨激烈。蘇軍動員達十八個師團，現在北從列寗格勒，南至庫班橋頭堡，全錢戰局，已漸入主力戰階段。德軍司令部已宣布「東綫戰爭現正展開從未會見的大規模戰鬥，蘇軍竭盡所有力量，不惜犧牲，對德軍陣地實行强力猛攻。」所以，雖然蘇方近來極力掩飾這種攻勢，說蘇軍方面不要採取全面攻勢，實際上只是一種企圖掩蔽大攻勢中之損害，以免刺激國內人心的一種辦法。事實上據德方軍訊，在這全面攻勢逐步展開中，即二十二日一日之內，蘇軍已損失戰車達五百六十六輛，可見其動員兵力之多及所蒙損失之重。東綫數百里至千餘里戰綫上，德蘇兩軍之空前大激戰，其前途對於整個歐局，具有極大的影響，實應爲全世界關心時局者注視。</p>
<p>地中海方面，義大利南部，以西西里島之爭奪爲中心的戰爭，自七月九日發動以來，英美加聯軍以班泰雷利亞及馬爾太爲根據，不斷增援，向西西里登陸進攻，現在戰事已在西西里島南，東，西三面展開，然而，所有這裏的戰爭，並不能影響到軸心軍的整個南綫的防衛戰力，因此，目前反軸心軍，正介圖奪取空中的優勢，以封鎖墨西拿海峽，同時以海陸軍在西島北岸活動，連日自東北岸至北部，美軍冒險登陸，但毫無成就。從地形上看，西西里島北部爲山岳地帶，也正是屏障義大利南部的天然陣綫，誰能加以佔領，誰就可以雄視地中海而控制南歐海岸。據海通社軍事訪員塞托黑斯稱，軸心軍司令部將西西里島防務，集中於該島東北部，而該島西部，包括巴勒摩，馬薩拉，及特拉巴尼等大城，正作有計劃的撤退，大概未來大戰，會在東北激烈展開，反軸心軍，在亞力山大將軍的指揮之下，也許就會在山岳中找到自己的墳墓，不過，我們對於西西里戰役，不能與南歐以至西歐孤立起來觀察的，反軸心軍顯然未把全部兵力用在這一方面，那麼，軸心軍豈能忽視西歐乃至南歐全局而在西島爭執一城一地？而從整個南歐戰局言，則義大利旣已宣布大部份國土進入戰爭狀態，實行戰時戒嚴令，而德國的精銳部隊，也已爲實踐攻守同盟而開始更大量的進軍義國，協助防禦，因此，地中海戰局可能獲得相當的稔定。</p>
<p>保障戰爭的最後勝利，其最主要的條件，是後方戰時總力體制的實踐。現在，蘇聯正被壓走上竭力以採行攻勢的危險之路，英美的國內問題及殖民地，自治邦，保護領問題，又正在紛爭迭起，反軸心國的後方動員力與對前綫的接濟力，究竟已發揮到何程度，雖難斷言，但其今後可能發揮者，則已有極明顯的限制。反之，軸心國方面，針對著國際局勢之發展，正在日益加強「戰時總力體制」，據廿四日中央社柏林電，德國政府，爲此已開始下列三項新的動員運動，第一是對於在德國佔有相當多數的中產階級，發表特別命令，封閉及整理一切不必要及不急需之商店·手工業·旅館及飲食店，俾騰出其餘剩的人力物力，用於軍需產業等緊急方面，以增强戰力。第二是對德國婦女，特別是少女的勞力，開始作大規模的有效的動員，使爲戰爭而服務，近來德國婦女在軍需工廠直接參加工作者，已佔全數百分之六十。今後在「神助勤務」口號下，勢必動員更多婦女到戰爭部門中去。第三，是男女學生的動員工作，除有特殊情形外，德國各大學專科學校及其他相當學校的男女學生，都奉令暫時放下筆桿，執起鐵鎚，進入軍需工廠工作。這種戰時總力體制，在反軸心國方面尚爲夢想所未及，則今後雙方決戰中戰鬥力之强弱，已可不卜而知。爲此，我們決不能爲一時一地的戰爭演變所迷惑，急應加强戰爭必勝的信念，與軸心國作更密切的協力。</p>
<h3>伊薩伯爾島上空　發生激烈空戰　日機襲夫納夫基美陣地</h3>
<p>束京廿五日中央社電　伊蔭怕爾島　日海軍地上部隊，於廿三日下午與來襲之敵急隆轟炸機三十架及巨人式戰鬥機廿架，展開激戰，結果擊落敵機三架。</p>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒廿五日中央社電　據新金山電。西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部蕙三日發表：日本航空部國　廿一日之後，復於廿三日轟炸夫　夫基島美軍陣地。</p>
<p>新佐治亞島敵苦戰情況</p>
<p>里斯本廿五日中央社電倫敦泰晤士報澳洲訪員近會在該報發表一文，題爲「新佐治亞情勢」，說明反軸心苦戰情形。大意謂，據新佐治亞消息，該島情況酷似新機內亞戰況，密林地帶雖在白畫亦漆黑如夜，而豪雨傾盆，地上泥濘沒腰，士兵爲　所淋，宛似落湯之鷄，且起臥於塹壕中，夜問除遭日軍奇襲外，且常爲黑虫所擾，故無不苦不堪言。日軍據守與在新幾內亞北岸所築同樣堅固之塹壕，一入夜間即深入美軍陣地，攪亂後方，於密林中着火，使美軍　恐混亂。該處日軍所擁有之糧食與彈藥，足以應付長期戰鬥，故美軍欲攻佔孟　決非易事云。</p>
<h3>收回滬租界　各地籌備慶祝</h3>
<p>無錫廿五日中央社電　扛陰訊，八月一日爲收囘上海公共租界之期，該縣爲擴大慶祝以示紀念，特由縣府聯合各機關舉行籌備慶祝會議，首由主席報告擴大慶祝意義，繼則討論慶祝大會事項。</p>
<p>中央社江陰訊、友邦尊重我國領土主權，交還上海租界，江陰民衆莫不額手稱慶。頃悉縣黨部已聯合縣政府　備擴大慶祝，業經排定行事日程表，俾便盛大宣傳，將於八月一日上午各界舉行聯合慶祝典禮，幷開民衆大會，一面率領黨員民衆，至友邦機關表示謝意，慰問傷兵。是日幷將張貼標語，散發傳單，宣揚交還親界之意義云。</p>
<p>無錫廿五日中央社電　本邑第七區黨部近爲收同上海公共租界有期，爲使此負有重大意義之歷史舉動深入民間起見，特召集所屬舉行座談會，務將此重大意義轉告民衆，以盡黨員責任。出席咯委員及所屬全體幹部，首由秦主委發表對此次收回上海公共租界之感想，對英美過去侵略情形，以及租界收回對友邦協力更表感謝等，頗爲詳盡。繼由在座各同志對於收回上海租界交換意見，座談二時左右始散。</p>
<h3>淪冀察戰區　形勢危殆</h3>
<p>廣州廿五日中央社電據重慶電，渝方自龐炳動與孫殿英兩將軍參加和平陣營後、即派新編第五軍軍長馬法吾收拾冀察戰區殘局。茲聞馬因接蔣介石電召，已行抵重慶。於廿四日會見記者團時，曾稱龐炳勳之脫離渝方，參加和運，已使冀察戰區發生種種因難，且日軍近對渝軍壓力日益加甚，故必須從速採取適當　策，以資補救云。</p>
<h3>陸軍第廿二師　點騐完竣</h3>
<p>雨京廿五日中央社電　暫編陸軍第廿二師，經軍事委員會汪委員長特準取消暫編字樣，陸軍編練總監公署遵照中央原定計劃，特於本月十日派參謀處長趙一雪，高級參謀於同遇爲正副主任，率同各部署委員分赴興化通如方面該師防地舉行嚴格點騐，檢查體格，審查資歷，測騐學術。因該區發生匪　及天候交通等關係，各點騐委員於昨日方始返京，對於此次點騐該師成績，異常良好云。</p>
<h3>日經濟使節團長談　中國當前兩大問題　—安定物價與解決食糧</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　日中國經濟考察團團長小倉正恒民，於十八日返抵東京後，即晋謁東條首相等日政府各當局，報告此次赴中國考察經過。二十四日下午並在此間丸之內東京銀行集會所招待記者團，就目下中國經濟問題發表談話。大意謂：目前中國經濟界之緊急對策，一爲物價問題，一爲糧食問題。中國政治經濟界有力人士對於安定物價價等常前問題，均一致希望日本積極協力，蓋在戰時下物價高漲與物資不足，此爲必然之現象。中國國內物價自去年十二月以來急激上升，考其原因，實爲國積所致，當前之對策，須加强收買配給等機構，以謀物資交流，並應從經濟上法律上採取適當措置，以謀促進對南方物資之交流。又糧食問題之解決，在安定民生上爲一極重要之問題，解決糧食問題之重點，厥在改良收買方法，並應以適當之指導方法與開發農地，以謀生產之增加，同時全國商業統制總會若能更進一步，研究合理之收買方策，則中國糧食問題，自能從速解決。</p>
<h3>皖高省長　公畢返蕪</h3>
<p>蕪湖廿五日中央社電　安徽省長高冠吾氏曁皖省連絡部長櫻庭大佐，前爲主持在安慶曾辦之安徽全省保安隊訓練第十期開學典禮，幷巡視安慶附近一帶新復縣治諸縣之一般政情與民間實况起見，曾於本月二十日午後乘輸離此溯江西上，茲悉高氏等業已公畢於日昨下午四時許由　寧乘輪　抵蕪埠，聞高省長櫻庭部長今日親　主持本省保安隊訓練團第四期蕪當相等縣保安隊受訓士兵之學業典禮、賜予剴切訓示。</p>
<h3>小磯總督　離滿返任</h3>
<p>新京二十五日中央社電　朝鮮總督小磯氏，此次訪滿任務完畢，已於今晨返任。該氏離滿之際，曾發表談話，並力言滿鮮提携之必要。其大意謂：余此次訪滿，目覩滿洲國自張國務總理以現政府各官長，肩負艱巨努力庶政之情形，深感敬佩，而允感滿洲國國基安如磐石，實非偶然倖致。滿鮮兩地相接，實負有共同之任命，余此次訪滿，更能確認滿鮮今後之提携協力，將益加强化，余於此更期滿洲國以全國國民之熱意，促進滿鮮之友誼，以完成決戰體制。</p>
<h3>西西裏島戰事　重心移至內地　德軍憑恃天險堅守陣地　裏昂福特區劇戰進行中</h3>
<p>柏林二十　日中央社電　據德國新聞社駐西西里特派記者柏拉納稱：四西里戰事之重心，已自喀太尼亞區移至該島內地，美軍及加拿大軍於星期五在瑪頓尼亞山及里昻福特地區，發動冀圖突破德軍陣地，但德軍仍在嚴守中。反軸心軍總司令此次改變計劃，顯係因英軍屢决以坦克車及軍艦之砲火，協助在喀太尼亞之南及蓋爾比尼附近進攻，皆被　潰，且蒙重大損失。德軍在喀太尼亞草原，運用其神妙之戰術，使蒙高茂萊將軍所部不能利用該地區，爲向北進攻之跳板，英軍已被迫探取壕溝戰，軸心軍居高臨下，頗佔上風。星明五喀太尼亞區雙方皆僅有斥堠活動及砲隊活動，巴頓將軍所部美軍已獲得蒙高茂萊將軍所　英軍及加軍增援，巴頓將軍之任務，顯然在乎遝用此項增援部隊，以任何代價突破軸心陣棧。以完成蒙高茂萊將軍所未竟之功。軸心軍前方部隊之調動，已將陣地增强。而可抽出少數部隊以困擾反軸心軍，其中一部突擊至西北海岸巴勒摩之東南約三十五公里之特爾米尼，消滅美軍之堅强哨所一處，在瑪頓尼亞山及里昻福特區，美軍及　軍冀圖突破，曾引起激烈之戰鬬。瑪頓尼亞山高的二千公尺。在北方海港塞法魯之南約二十公里，而里昻福特則距瑪頓尼亞山之東南的四十五公里，但各處德軍之前方陣地皆在固守中。軸心軍已撤離該島南部之全部有地帶，故反軸心軍在該處獲進展。</p>
<h3>義大使　訪土外長</h3>
<p>斯丹埠二十五日中央社電　義駐土大使葛利里，於二十四日訪七外長美奈門卓格魯，會談甚久</p>
<h3>匈牙利　外長易人</h3>
<p>匈京二十五日中央社電　匈矛利外次傑克齊已升任爲外長，以代總理凱萊。新外長就職時，曾致電問候日德義保芬各國之外長。傑氏誕生於一八九三年，向有小數民族問題專家之譽，一九三六年至一九三九年曾在柏林匈使館洪職。</p>
<h3>洛彬磯交通工人　實行罷工</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩二十五日中央社電　據海通社訊洛杉磯電車與公共汽車工人三千名，因戰爭勞工局拒絕增加工資之要求，昨日實行罷工，致交通大受影響，百萬餘人民途不得不徒步前往辦事處工作，該城郊外之大飛機廠之職工允感不便，該地軍事司令麥茶拉宣稱：罷工倘不停止。將宣佈緊急狀態。</p>
<h3>一日間出動三千架　東綫德機活躍　猛烈轟炸蘇後方運輸綫　奧勒爾蘇軍攻勢又挫敗</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　像德國新聞社軍事記者哈瑪上校於二十四日報告電綫戰况稱：蘇軍於二十二日首在東終之重要地點大舉反攻，但均被德軍擊退，且受重創。二十三日又企圖　動攻勢，蘇軍之反攻重點仍在奧勒爾區，蘇軍日前在奧勒爾北方及其東南方之德軍戰　攻破裂口，復爲擴大裂口計，乃於二十三日在該方　出動極多預備部隊，但其企圖仍完全失敗，蘇軍是日僅在奥勒爾地區一處，即已被德陸軍擊毀戰車九十二輛，又被德　炸毀六十七輛，蘇軍曾於二十三日在大砲空軍及戰車之掩護下，數度猛攻庫彭橋頭堡壘，但終未得逞。密烏斯河戰綫，蘇軍曾在迫擊砲之掩護下、使戰車及步兵部隊前進，但遭德空軍轟炸，其砲兵陣地立趨沉默，故其企圖完全失敗，綜計蘇軍於二十三日中喪失戰車四百二寸四輛。又德空軍曾於是日協力前綫德軍作戰，並在亞索夫海至奥勒爾地區北方之戰錢建立殊勳，蓋曾猛炸蘇車後方鐵道，炸毀車站數處及軍火倉庫，切斷重要運輸路，並猛炸滿載兵員資材之軍用火車三列予以重創。德空軍是日在東綫共出動飛機三千架，結果僅損失五架。</p>
<h3>王克敏氏　關心北京食糧　列爲施政方針之一　學子寄自北京</h3>
<p>自從本年舊正物價暴漲以來，食糧問題。爲各界最所關心的事。此次王克敏氏繼長華北政委會也是以解決食糧問題爲其就任的施政方針宣　之一。針對　個事實，政府當局過去曾經採取了兩個應付方針：一方面和各地交涉採購食糧，一方面不許私存食糧面實行公定價格。</p>
<p>採購食糧，眞是頗費苦心，王蔭泰督辦的奔波，最爲努力，可是還沒有得到最後的成功。外地採購，旣非易事，於是就想在現有的存糧利水地的生產上想辦法。華北物資物價委員曾於五月五日佈告商民呈報存糧數目，勸告存糧商民凡听存超過該戶口半年之消費量者，迅將所存種類數量自動報告，這措置就是爲此而發的。後來又由「勸告」而變成「勒令」，而有凡不告者查出即行沒收處罰的命令，苒後又有違反命令加以緊急治罪的規律，最後則佈告　於六月二十日以前呈　完畢，同時又出示以公定價格强制收買本地的產量和存糧，這公定的償格是很低的，其他小米，高梁·米·玉米·三項也以差不多相近的價格收買之。六月二十日又加上穀子·高梁·兩項的公定價格，說明自六月二十一日起實行。這些措置對於糧價的同跌確有相當的影響。再加以四五月間下了幾陣大雨，於是「豐收有望」的消息，就在各報出現，而六月中句的食糧，也居然跌到最低價格。六月三十日報紙上又登載有市公署社會局所制定的食糧零售暫定平均價，以之爲暫時的公定零售價。這公定價格剛剛開始實行。朱深委員長突於七月二日病逝，糧食問題，又受了波折，於是，劉玉書市長就於本月十八日對記者的談話中叙述了政府對於當前現象所採取的辦法：</p>
<p>「在此期間，家無隔宿之　之人、應竭力保護之維持之，予以種種方便，使其不致斷炊。希望勸告有存糧者勿再擠購、使極貧苦之人，得以生活，……希望各分局區公所應多方適查，有存糧者按日計算，自某日起至某日止不售糧字樣，在其戶口附表上加紙注明蓋戵，使其在期內不能購置，必須於其食糧將盡時始准往講。」（七月十九日實報）</p>
<p>這個辦法，是臨時措置，現在不克敏委員長已於十八日飛返北京，我們正在等着他的辦法，使北京的食糧，早趨平定。（七月二十一日）</p>

<h3>李浩駒暢述　郵務設施　收支情形仍失均衡</h3>
<p>前上海郵政總局郵務長兼郵政總局駐滬辦事處主任法人乍配林，業經辭職退休，郵政機構略有變更，郵務長除由幫辦王偉生升任外，中央並委李浩駒爲駐滬辦事處主任，國風社記者爲明瞭最近郵務情形起見，特往訪李氏，承發表下列談話：</p>
<p>郵務狀態</p>
<p>據李氏談：余於本月八日到局視事，關於目前郵務情形，外間或多不明眞相。關於組織系統，在建股部下，有郵政總局籌備處，已設立兩年於茲，但總局迄未正式成立，由該部郵電司負責管理全國郵務。現在共分六個郵區，即湖北·安徽·江蘇·浙江·廣東參上海等區。本辦事處所轄範圍，不僅限於上海區，上述六區全在本處管理之下，本處機構無大變更，主任之下尙有副主任高木氏（高氏乃前國府經濟顧間），以下共分三科，掌理各種人事與業務等事宜。</p>
<p>收支情形</p>
<p>關於本周收支情形，目前仍失均衡，緣自六月一日郵資加價以來，每月最多不過增加二百五十萬元之收入，而且體日以後之物價，又復高膽，於是各員工米貼及其他開銷之支出，遠在增入數目之上，此種入不敷出情形，中央正在統籌辦法中。關於郵包之恢復寄遞，目前業經實行，但有兩點須注意：（一）須不違反物費統劃條例，（二）須斟酌收包地域之交通情况。</p>
<p>市區戶口米</p>
<p>市區戶口米自第二十一期起，增至一升五合，惟十九，二十兩期，則每人仍規定授糧一升，售價方面亦重行調整，每升由四元五角增至六元。</p>
<h3>上海第一個孤兒院　土山灣孤兒院巡禮（二）</h3>
<p>孤兒院在這名勝區內，有着最悠久的歷史。據說在淸代，咸豐五年（公元一八五五年），天主教的薛孔昭紳父，在靑浦的樓塘鎭創辦孤兒院，後來遷移到上海西鄉的蔡家灣。咸豐十年（一八六〇年）太平天國的革命軍向上海近郊挺進，淸兵出戰，蔡家灣孤兒院竟在那决戰爭中完全毀滅，孤兒多被殺害，連拯救孤兒的馬神父亦爲亂兵殘殺。一部份脫險的孤兒，寄居於滬南的董家渡、四年之後，即同治三年（一八六四年）又由董家渡遷至滬西徐家匯土山灣，從這一年算來也有八十年了。</p>
<p>孤兒院遷到土山灣以後，環境適宜，於是救育孤兒事業，就有正常的發展，不單作消極的救濟，並進而注力於積極的教養，因此添設工塲，一方面訓練孤兒，使學得謀生必要的技藝，另一方面使孤兒長大成人後，即不出院，也可有工作自謀生計。自從咸豐五年起，八十八年以來，該院曾收養孤兒五千五百餘名，自幼稚以至成家立業，其間撫養培植眞是煞費苦心，據說該院出身的孤兒，除了在該院工塲服務之外，有的在上海各工廠商店謀生，其間還有不少已經自設工廠，營業繁盛的，甚至到各地服務，獲得各方讚美者也很多，譽爲百齡老人馬相伯先生賞識而在藝術界獲得相當聲譽的張充仁君，也就是該院出身的孤兒</p>
<p>半工半讀敎學</p>
<p>土山灣孤兒院特色之一，是對孤兒實施半工半誼的教學。</p>
<p>一進大門，是一片草坪。西面巍峙的古洋樓號是工讀的實騐所』慈雲小學』的校會、西南的稱塊草地，已屬爲大小球塲，再西就是榮圃，四周綫植樹木，構成幽雅的校園。孤兒們的學習環境，可說是再適宜不過的了。</p>
<p>慈雲小學在前年（三十年）實行整理改組後，編制方面，沒有初級小學四年，高級小學一年，實習班二年，採用學年升級秋季始業單軌制。初小四年的學科，和普通學校樣，一部份（四十名）孤兒，還在　師小學寄讀，早出晚歸，以院爲家。學費膳宿，都由院繳付，據說成績都列前茅，是該院『爭氣的』子弟。</p>
<p>孤兒升入高級小學後，除了普通學科之外，每天劉出若干鐘點到該院各工塲，稍稍學習工藝。高級小學畢業以後，升入實習班，早晚仍繼續教學各科基本知識如公民，經濟、史地，簿計，外國語等等，使將來學成後具備充分的國民常識與道德基礎。早晚以外的時間、即爲各工塲的實習生，稱爲學徒，各就性情與知能所近，學習各種工藝，以備將來畢業後進八社會，爲一具備優秀學養與技能的模範工人。實習期爲二年。</p>

        <h1>1943.07.26</h1>
<h3>On the European War Situation</h3>
<p>The European war situation has consistently regarded the Eastern Front as the primary battlefield. Since July 5th, after a four-month period of lull, a fierce summer campaign has begun. However, as we pointed out a few days ago, the German side, based on the lessons learned from the past two years of warfare, has abandoned the strategy of deep, long-range incursions. Instead, they are concentrating their efforts on annihilating the combat power of the Soviet forces to ensure victory. Therefore, in the intense warfare of the past three weeks, from Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod, they have generally not adopted an advancing posture, except for necessary advances in certain areas. What they have been striving for is to use fluid tactics and new sharp weapons, especially the "Tiger" tanks, to inflict serious blows on the already offensive Soviet forces. Now, under the fierce attacks of the German army, the Soviet military authorities have been compelled to adopt a larger-scale offensive, which is to realize the so-called "luring the tiger out of the mountain" strategy, in order to deal a decisive blow. Since last week, the Soviet side has launched a full-scale offensive, starting from the Orel front, and widened the battle lines, not only in the Belgorod area, but also as far as the Leningrad front in the north. Some Soviet forces have even attempted a landing in Norway. Except for the latter being immediately repulsed by the Axis forces, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 24th, since the 22nd, the Soviet army has launched a large-scale offensive in the Leningrad area, and the northern section of the Eastern Front has become fierce again. The Soviet army has mobilized 18 divisions. Now, from Leningrad in the north to the Kuban bridgehead in the south, the entire front war situation has gradually entered the main battle stage. The German High Command has announced that "the war on the Eastern Front is now unfolding on a scale never seen before. The Soviet army is exhausting all its strength, sparing no sacrifice, and launching strong attacks on the German positions." Therefore, although the Soviet side has recently tried its best to conceal this offensive, claiming that the Soviet army does not want to adopt a full-scale offensive, it is actually a way to conceal the damage in the major offensive, so as not to stimulate domestic morale. In fact, according to German military reports, in the gradual unfolding of this full-scale offensive, the Soviet army lost as many as 566 tanks in a single day on the 22nd, which shows the large number of troops mobilized and the heavy losses suffered. The unprecedented fierce battle between the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front, spanning hundreds to thousands of miles, has a great impact on the entire European situation and should be watched by those who are concerned about the situation around the world.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, the war centered on the battle for Sicily in southern Italy. Since it was launched on July 9th, the British, American, and Canadian allied forces have been continuously reinforcing their forces, using Pantelleria and Malta as bases, and landing to attack Sicily. Now the war has spread to the south, east, and west of Sicily. However, none of these wars can affect the overall defense capability of the Axis forces on the southern front. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces are currently trying to seize air superiority in order to blockade the Strait of Messina. At the same time, naval and land forces are operating on the northern coast of the island, and American troops have been risking landings on the northeast coast to the north for days, but without success. From a topographical point of view, the northern part of Sicily is a mountainous area, which is also a natural defensive line for southern Italy. Whoever can occupy it can dominate the Mediterranean and control the coast of Southern Europe. According to Reuters military correspondent Seto Hughes, the Axis High Command is concentrating its defense of Sicily in the northeastern part of the island, while the western part of the island, including the major cities of Palermo, Marsala, and Trapani, is undergoing a planned retreat. It is likely that the future major battle will unfold fiercely in the northeast, and the anti-Axis forces, under the command of General Alexander, may find their graves in the mountains. However, we cannot observe the Sicilian campaign in isolation from Southern Europe and even Western Europe. The anti-Axis forces obviously have not used all their forces in this area, so how can the Axis forces ignore the overall situation in Western Europe and even Southern Europe and fight for a city or place on the island? From the perspective of the overall war situation in Southern Europe, since Italy has announced that most of its territory has entered a state of war and implemented martial law, and the elite troops of Germany have also begun to march into Italy in greater numbers to assist in defense in order to fulfill their alliance obligations, the Mediterranean war situation may achieve considerable stability.</p>
<p>The most important condition for guaranteeing the final victory of the war is the implementation of the wartime total power system in the rear. Now, the Soviet Union is being pushed onto the dangerous path of trying its best to adopt an offensive. Domestic problems and issues of colonies, autonomous states, and protectorates in Britain and the United States are also arising in succession. It is difficult to say to what extent the mobilization of the anti-Axis countries in the rear and their support for the front have been brought into play, but there are already very obvious limitations on what they may be able to bring into play in the future. Conversely, the Axis countries are increasingly strengthening the "wartime total power system" in response to the development of the international situation. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 24th, the German government has begun the following three new mobilization movements for this purpose. The first is to issue special orders to the middle class, which occupies a considerable majority in Germany, to close and reorganize all unnecessary and non-urgent shops, handicrafts, hotels, and restaurants, so as to free up the remaining manpower and material resources for emergency aspects such as military industries, in order to enhance combat power. The second is to start a large-scale and effective mobilization of the labor force of German women, especially young girls, to serve the war. Recently, German women who directly participate in work in military factories have accounted for 60% of the total. In the future, under the slogan of "divine assistance service", it is bound to mobilize more women to the war departments. The third is the mobilization of male and female students. Except for special circumstances, male and female students in German universities, vocational schools, and other equivalent schools have been ordered to temporarily put down their pens, pick up hammers, and enter military factories to work. This kind of wartime total power system is still a dream for the anti-Axis countries, so the strength of combat power in the upcoming decisive battle between the two sides can be known without divination. For this reason, we must not be confused by the wartime evolution of a temporary place and should strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the war and cooperate more closely with the Axis countries.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 25th (Central News Agency) According to a New Gold Mountain dispatch, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Command announced on the 23rd, after the 21st, the Japanese aviation corps bombed US positions on Funafuti Island again.</p>
<p>Difficult Battle Situation for the Enemy on New Georgia Island</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) The Australian correspondent of the London Times recently published an article in the newspaper entitled "The Situation on New Georgia," describing the difficult battle situation for the anti-Axis forces. The general idea is that, according to news from New Georgia, the situation on the island is very similar to the battle situation in New Guinea. The dense forest area is as dark as night even in the daytime, and torrential rain is pouring down, the mud on the ground is waist-deep, and the soldiers are drenched, like chickens that have fallen into the water. Moreover, they lie down and get up in the trenches and are often disturbed by black insects at night, so they are all suffering unspeakable hardships. The Japanese army is entrenched in the same solid trenches as those built on the northern coast of New Guinea. Once night falls, they penetrate deep into the US positions, disrupt the rear, and set fires in the dense forests, causing the US military to panic and be confused. The Japanese army there has enough food and ammunition to cope with a long-term battle, so it is by no means easy for the US military to capture Munda.</p>

<h3>The War Zone in Hebei and Chahar is in a Precarious Situation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) According to a Chongqing dispatch, after Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying joined the peace camp, the Chongqing side sent Ma Fawu, commander of the newly formed Fifth Army, to clean up the remnants of the war zone in Hebei and Chahar.

<h3>Head of the Japanese Economic Mission Discusses Two Major Problems in China Today - Stabilizing Prices and Solving the Food Problem</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) Ogura Masatsune, head of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission to China, after returning to Tokyo on the 18th, immediately visited Prime Minister Tojo and other Japanese government authorities to report on his trip to China. On the afternoon of the 24th, he also met with the press corps at the Tokyo Bank Assembly Hall in Marunouchi to talk about the current economic problems in China. The general idea is: the urgent countermeasures for the current Chinese economic circles are the price problem and the food problem. Influential figures in the Chinese political and economic circles unanimously hope that Japan will actively cooperate in stabilizing prices and other current problems, because high prices and insufficient materials are inevitable phenomena in wartime. Domestic prices in China have risen sharply since December last year. The reason is actually the country's backlog. The current countermeasures must strengthen purchasing and distribution agencies to promote the exchange of materials, and take appropriate measures economically and legally to promote the exchange of materials to the south. The solution to the food problem is a very important issue in stabilizing people's lives. The key to solving the food problem lies in improving purchasing methods, and appropriate guidance methods and the development of farmland should be used to increase production. At the same time, if the National Commercial Control Association can further study reasonable purchasing strategies, China's food problem can be solved quickly.</p>

<h3>Governor-General Koiso Leaves Manchuria to Return to His Post</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 25th (Central News Agency) Korean Governor-General Koiso has completed his mission to visit Manchuria and returned to his post this morning. When he left Manchuria, he made a speech and strongly emphasized the necessity of cooperation between Manchuria and Korea. The general idea is: During my visit to Manchuria, I witnessed the Prime Minister Zhang and the current government officials shouldering the heavy task of working hard in all aspects of administration, and I deeply admired them. I sincerely feel that the foundation of Manchuria is as solid as a rock, which is by no means accidental. Manchuria and Korea are adjacent to each other and have a common mission. My visit to Manchuria has further confirmed that the cooperation and cooperation between Manchuria and Korea will be further strengthened in the future. I hereby further hope that Manchuria will promote the friendship between Manchuria and Korea with the enthusiasm of the national people to complete the decisive battle system.</p>
<h3>The Focus of the Battle of Sicily Shifts to the Interior The German Army Relies on Natural Barriers to Hold Its Ground Fierce Fighting is Underway in the Leonforte Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) According to Branner, a special correspondent for the German News Agency stationed in Sicily: The focus of the battle in Western Sicily has shifted from the Catania area to the interior of the island. On Friday, the American and Canadian forces launched an attempt to break through the German positions in the Madonie Mountains and the Leonforte area, but the German army is still holding its ground. The anti-Axis forces commander-in-chief changed his plan this time, apparently because the British army repeatedly decided to use the firepower of tanks and warships to assist in the attacks in the south of Catania and near Gerbini, but they were all defeated and suffered heavy losses. In the Catania Plain, the German army used its miraculous tactics to prevent General Montgomery's troops from using the area as a springboard for attacking north, and the British army was forced to explore trench warfare, with the Axis army occupying a commanding position and gaining the upper hand. On a clear morning on the fifth, both sides in the Catania area had only reconnaissance activities and artillery activities. The American forces under General Patton have been reinforced by the British and Canadian troops under General Montgomery. General Patton's mission is obviously to use these reinforcements to break through the Axis positions at any cost. To accomplish what General Montgomery failed to do. The movement of the Axis forward units has strengthened the positions. And a small number of troops can be drawn out to harass the anti-Axis forces. One of the troops raided Termini, about 35 kilometers southeast of Palermo on the northwest coast, and wiped out a strong US outpost. In the Madonie Mountains and the Leonforte area, American and military forces attempted to break through, causing fierce fighting. The Madonie Mountains are 2,000 meters high. About 20 kilometers south of the northern port of Cefalu, and Leonforte is 45 kilometers southeast of the Madonie Mountains, but the forward positions of the German army in all places are holding firm. The Axis forces have withdrawn from all the occupied areas in the south of the island, so the anti-Axis forces have made progress there.</p>

<h3>3,000 German Planes Sortied in One Day Active German Aircraft on the Eastern Front Fierce Bombing of Soviet Rear Transport Lines Soviet Offensive in Orel Thwarted Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) Like the German News Agency military reporter Colonel Hammer reported on the 24th about the situation on the electric line war, the Soviet army launched a major counteroffensive in important locations on the eastern end on the 22nd, but were repelled by the German army and suffered heavy losses. On the 23rd, it again attempted to launch an offensive. The focus of the Soviet army's counteroffensive was still in the Orel area. The Soviet army had previously breached the German battle in the north and southeast of Orel, and in order to expand the breach, it dispatched a large number of reserve forces in that area on the 23rd, but its attempt still completely failed. On that day, in the Orel area alone, the Soviet army had 92 tanks destroyed by the German army and 67 tanks bombed by the German army. On the 23rd, the Soviet army launched several fierce attacks on the Kupen bridgehead under the cover of artillery, air force, and tanks, but ultimately failed. On the Mius River front, the Soviet army advanced tank and infantry units under the cover of mortars, but they were bombed by the German air force, and its artillery positions immediately fell silent, so its attempt completely failed. In total, the Soviet army lost 424 tanks on the 23rd. The German air force also cooperated with the German army on the front line on the same day and established special achievements on the front line from the Sea of Azov to the north of the Orel area. It bombed the Soviet rear railways fiercely, destroyed several stations and ammunition depots, cut off important transport routes, and bombed three military trains full of soldiers and materials, inflicting heavy damage. The German air force sortied a total of 3,000 aircraft on the Eastern Front on the same day, and only lost five aircraft as a result.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Kemin Concerned About Food in Beijing Listed as One of the Policy Guidelines A Student Sent from Beijing</h3>
<p>Since the surge in prices during the old New Year this year, the food problem has been the most concerned thing for all walks of life. This time, Mr. Wang Kemin, who succeeded the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, also declared solving the food problem as one of his policy guidelines upon taking office. In response to this fact, the government authorities had previously adopted two coping strategies: on the one hand, negotiating with various places to purchase food, and on the other hand, not allowing private storage of food and implementing official fixed prices.</p>
<p>Purchasing food is really a painstaking effort. Director Wang Yintai's efforts have been the most active, but he has not yet achieved final success. It is not easy to purchase from other places, so we want to find a way to use the existing grain storage and the production of aquatic land. The North China Material and Price Committee issued a notice to merchants and residents on May 5 to report the amount of grain stored, and advised merchants and residents who stored more than six months of consumption for their household to quickly report the type and quantity of grain stored. This measure was issued for this purpose. Later, it changed from "advising" to "ordering", and there was an order that those who failed to report would be confiscated and punished upon discovery. Then there were regulations that those who violated the order would be urgently punished, and finally a notice was issued that the report should be completed before June 20, and at the same time, a notice was issued to forcibly purchase the local production and stored grain at official fixed prices. The official fixed price is very low. The other three items of millet, sorghum, rice, and corn are also purchased at almost similar prices. On June 20, the official fixed prices for the two items of millet and sorghum were added, stating that they would be implemented from June 21. These measures have had a considerable impact on the decline in grain prices. In addition, there were several heavy rains in April and May, so the news that "a bumper harvest is expected" appeared in various newspapers, and in mid-June, food prices actually fell to the lowest price. On June 30, the newspapers also published the tentatively average retail price of food formulated by the Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau, which was used as a temporary official retail price. This official fixed price has just begun to be implemented. Committee Chairman Zhu Shen suddenly died of illness on July 2, and the food problem suffered another setback. Therefore, Mayor Liu Yushu described the measures taken by the government for the current phenomenon in an interview with reporters on the 18th of this month:</p>
<p>"During this period, those who have no overnight grain should be protected and maintained with all efforts, and all kinds of conveniences should be provided to prevent them from running out of food. I hope to advise those who have stored grain not to rush to buy it anymore, so that the extremely poor people can live... I hope that the sub-bureaus and district offices should investigate in many ways. Those who have stored grain should calculate it on a daily basis, and write the words 'no grain will be sold from a certain day to a certain day' on their household registration form and affix a seal to prevent them from purchasing it during the period. They must be allowed to speak when their food is about to run out." (July 19, Shishi Daily)</p>
<p>This method is a temporary measure. Now that Committee Chairman Kemin has flown back to Beijing on the 18th, we are waiting for his method to make Beijing's food prices tend to stabilize as soon as possible. (July 21)</p>

<h3>Authorities Pay Attention to Shanghai Market Prices Individually Defeat Manipulators and Hoarders All Citizens are Now Focusing on the Results</h3>
<p>In order for Shanghai to become the starting point for solving wartime economic problems, the authorities will make every effort to promote the full implementation of the "Wartime Economic Program" in Shanghai, and will pay the closest attention to the recent increasing price panic. In terms of implementation agencies, the National Commercial Coordination Association, the Material Investigation Committee, and the Shanghai Office of the Material Control Review Committee will be the three-in-one axis. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters' inquiries from the financial circles yesterday, in principle, the countermeasures for the price problem should be fully responsible by the actual center, the Commercial Coordination Association, and its lower-level organizations, the Twenty-Two Trade Associations and the Fifty-odd Major Trade Associations. However, because of fear of being unable to do so, it has no choice but to maintain the closest contact and cooperation with the Material Investigation Committee and the Material Control Review Committee, so that control, investigation, and review are integrated into one. It is widely believed that future price countermeasures will be based on the principle of focusing on key points, that is, starting with the most important materials that are manipulated and hoarded, and implementing individual attacks. For example, the recent investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by the Material Investigation Committee and the special attention of the police authorities to cloth merchants are all based on this intention. As for other materials, when the authorities deem it necessary to rectify them, they will also be handled in the same way. Speculative profiteers will never be tolerated.</p>

<h3>Investigation and Prohibition of Smuggling Tea</h3>

<h3>Li Haoju Elaborates on Postal Service Facilities and Revenue and Expenditure Situation Remains Unbalanced</h3>
<p>The former Postmaster General of the Shanghai Postal Administration and Director of the Shanghai Office of the Directorate General of Posts, a Frenchman named Chapelin, has resigned and retired. There have been slight changes in the postal organization. In addition to the promotion of Assistant Wang Weisheng to Postmaster General, the central government has appointed Li Haoju as the Director of the Shanghai Office. In order to understand the latest postal situation, a reporter from the Guofeng News Agency visited Mr. Li, who provided the following information:</p>
<p>Postal Service Status</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li: I took office on the 8th of this month. The outside world may not fully understand the current postal situation. Regarding the organizational system, under the Construction Department (建股部), there is the Preparatory Office of the Directorate General of Posts, which has been established for two years, but the Directorate General has not been officially established and is managed by the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications. Currently, there are six postal districts: Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shanghai. The jurisdiction of this office is not limited to the Shanghai district. All six districts mentioned above are under the management of this office. There have been no major changes to the structure of this office. Under the Director, there is also Deputy Director Mr. Takagi (Mr. Takagi is a former economic advisor to the National Government), and below them, there are three sections responsible for various personnel and business matters.</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Situation</p>
<p>Regarding the revenue and expenditure situation this week, the balance is still uneven. Since the postal rates increased on June 1st, the monthly increase in revenue has been no more than 2.5 million yuan. Moreover, since that day, prices have risen sharply, so the expenses for rice subsidies and other expenses for employees are far above the increased revenue. The central government is coordinating a solution to this situation of income not covering expenses. The resumption of parcel delivery has now been implemented, but there are two points to note: (1) It must not violate the provisions of the commodity control regulations, and (2) The traffic situation in the parcel destination area must be considered.</p>
<p>Rice Rations for City Residents</p>
<p>The rice ration for city residents has been increased to 1.5 liters per person starting from the 21st distribution period. However, for the 19th and 20th periods, the ration is still set at 1 liter per person. The selling price has also been adjusted, increasing from 4.5 yuan to 6 yuan per liter.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage (II)</h3>
<p>The orphanage has the longest history in this scenic area. It is said that during the Qing Dynasty, in the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855 AD), Father Xue Kongzhao, a Catholic gentleman, founded an orphanage in Loutang Town, Qingpu, which was later moved to Caijiawan in the western suburbs of Shanghai. In the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860 AD), the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolutionary army advanced towards the suburbs of Shanghai, and Qing soldiers went to battle. The Caijiawan Orphanage was completely destroyed in that war, and many orphans were killed. Even Father Ma, who was saving the orphans, was brutally murdered by the soldiers. A portion of the orphans who escaped danger took refuge in Dongjiadu in southern Shanghai. Four years later, in the third year of Tongzhi (1864 AD), they were moved from Dongjiadu to Tushanwan in the western suburbs of Shanghai. It has been eighty years since that year.</p>
<p>After the orphanage moved to Tushanwan, the environment was suitable, and the work of rescuing and educating orphans developed normally. It not only provided passive relief but also focused on active education and training. Therefore, workshops were added, on the one hand to train the orphans and teach them the necessary skills to make a living, and on the other hand so that the orphans could have work and support themselves even after they grew up and left the orphanage. Since the fifth year of Xianfeng, over the past eighty-eight years, the orphanage has taken in more than 5,500 orphans, nurturing and cultivating them from infancy to adulthood. It is said that besides serving in the orphanage's workshops, some of the orphans who came from the orphanage work in factories and stores in Shanghai, and many have even established their own factories and have flourishing businesses. Many have even gone to work in various places and have received praise from all sides. Zhang Chongren, who was appreciated by Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian, and gained considerable fame in the art world, was also an orphan who came from this orphanage.</p>
<p>Part-Work, Part-Study Education</p>
<p>One of the features of the Tushanwan Orphanage is the implementation of part-work, part-study education for the orphans.</p>
<p>Upon entering the main gate, there is a lawn. The ancient western-style building towering to the west is the "workshop and laboratory" called "Ciyun Elementary School." To the southwest is a grassy area that serves as a ball field, and further west is the Rong Garden, surrounded by trees, creating a quiet and elegant campus. The learning environment for the orphans can be said to be most suitable.</p>
<p>After the reorganization and restructuring of Ciyun Elementary School the year before last (1941), in terms of curriculum, there are four years of primary school, one year of advanced primary school, and two years of internship classes, adopting a single-track system of annual promotion and autumn semester start. The subjects in the four years of primary school are the same as in ordinary schools. A portion (40) of the orphans also attend Shishi Elementary School, leaving early and returning late, with the orphanage as their home. Tuition and boarding are paid by the orphanage. It is said that their grades are among the best, and they are the "promising" children of the orphanage.</p>
<p>After the orphans enter advanced primary school, in addition to regular subjects, they spend a certain number of hours each day in the orphanage's workshops, learning crafts. After graduating from advanced primary school, they enter the internship class. In the mornings and evenings, they continue to learn the basic knowledge of various subjects, such as civics, economics, history, geography, accounting, and foreign languages, so that they will have sufficient common knowledge and a moral foundation when they graduate in the future. The time outside of the mornings and evenings is spent as interns in the workshops, called apprentices, learning various crafts according to their temperament and skills, in order to prepare them for entering society after graduation as model workers with excellent scholarship and skills. The internship period is two years.</p>
<p>Graduation Ceremony of the Workers' Technical College. The graduation ceremony of the first graduating class of the mechanical engineering department of the Workers' Technical Night School, sponsored by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau, was held at the Grand China Cinema at 9:00 AM on the 24th. The graduates of this class have completed three years of study in mechanical engineering. There were a total of eleven graduates. A short industrial film was shown at the end. The event concluded at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Fellow-Countrymen's Tutoring School. The Guangdong Fellow-Countrymen's Association in Shanghai is preparing to establish a tutoring school at its headquarters. It will first recruit ten male and female students for the clothing class, tuition-free, and teach subjects such as network writing, Japanese, English, and bookkeeping. Registration will be open from now until July 30th. The examination will be held at 7:00 PM on July 31st, and classes will begin on August 5th.</p>

<p>Hoping for Guidance from All Sectors at Any Time Schedule of Examinations for Each Group to be Announced Tomorrow</p>
<p>The dates and locations of the scholarship examinations for the readers of this newspaper have been decided. However, due to the large number of applicants, the schedules for the primary school, junior high school, senior high school, and university groups will be arranged separately, and the schedules will be announced in the newspaper on the 27th. As for the selection criteria for the examination, they are listed below. We hope to receive guidance from all sectors. Yesterday, this newspaper received scholarship donations from all sectors, which we deeply appreciate. The list of donors will be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>Selection Criteria</p>
<p>Regarding the selection criteria, this newspaper takes into account the original intention of the readers' donations, the supervision and teaching of all sectors, the assistance of educational pioneers, the instructions of the scholarship committee, and the experience of colleagues in handling scholarships in previous years. Before approving scholarships for this year, we would like to have an open discussion with all sectors. The capabilities of our colleagues are limited, and we are concerned that we may not be able to fully meet the ideal standard. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all sectors and the donors will provide enthusiastic guidance in order to further improve. (If you wish to provide feedback, please send your letters directly to the Scholarship Office of this newspaper.)</p>
<p>Screening Steps</p>
<p>The screening steps currently proposed by this newspaper: 1. School grades and conduct; 2. Physical strength; 3. Performance on the examination administered by this newspaper; 4. On-site investigation of family circumstances; 5. Completeness of the administration of the school. Based on the above steps: 1. Those who are from poor families, have lost their fathers or brothers, or are separated from their families, and who apply for scholarships; 2. Those who have excellent grades and conduct at school and perform well on the examination administered by this newspaper; 3. Those who are from poor families and usually work to support their families, have average grades, but have outstanding conduct; 4. Those who attend schools that are administered seriously and have excellent grades; 5. Those who study specialized subjects that are practical; 6. Those who are particularly intelligent and show special talent in major subjects and have been recognized by the school, will all be given priority for approval after taking the examination administered by this newspaper, and will be given preferential aid for tuition and miscellaneous fees. Based on these principles, those who: 1. have poor character; 2. have extremely poor grades; 3. are from families who can still afford to pay; 4. attend schools that do not grade strictly, have poor conduct, and fail the examination administered by this newspaper, and are not from very poor families, will not be approved in order to ensure the responsible allocation of donations. This newspaper hereby clarifies its starting point for the review, namely, adhering to the principle of treating everyone equally, maintaining a rigorous and careful attitude, and striving to approve scholarships for all applicants as the highest principle, and only making exceptions when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Scholarship Amount</p>
<p>As for the possibility that the funds held by this newspaper may be insufficient, the responsibility for raising funds will be borne by all sectors of society and by our colleagues. The approval itself will not be affected. If we can receive donations from all sectors in the coming days, it would be fortunate if the revenue and expenditure balance out by the time we do our accounting. Otherwise, after the approved number is determined, if there is a shortfall, we will announce it to the public and we are confident that the generosity of all sectors will gather large sums of money in the shortest possible time to complete this year's scholarship campaign.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Rationing in the Interior</h3>

<h3>Fair-Priced Coal for Boiled Water Shops First Batch to be Sold 500 Tons to be Evenly Distributed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boiled Water Shop Trade Association, at the request of all its members, requested the authorities to restore the sale of "Fair-Priced Coal for Boiled Water Shops" to facilitate the purchase of fuel and reduce costs. The association immediately submitted a report to the Dachunglian Coal Company and relevant authorities, explaining the situation of the industry. The coal industry has now formally approved the direct distribution of the first batch of fuel by industry merchants. The price is based on the industry merchant distribution price, plus the profit of small retailers. The first batch of coal to be distributed is: (1) Dabunku Screening Block (self-igniting), 300 tons, at a price of 444.2 yuan per ton. (2) Shandong Screening Block (self-igniting), 200 tons, at a price of 446.3 yuan per ton, totaling 500 tons. Each boiled water shop will receive an average of seven baskets. The coal will be distributed by five coal companies: Yitaixing, Dachang, Tongcheng, Sun Bozhao, and Junchang.</p>

<p>Economic News</p>
<h3>Rural Pawnshops Allowed to Accept Deposits</h3>
<p>In order to revive the rural economy, the authorities have promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Rural Pawnshops and are encouraging the establishment of rural pawnshops. At the same time, rural pawnshops are allowed to accept deposits, but the total amount of deposits must not exceed half of the capital on hand. However, they are not allowed to accept savings deposits. Rural pawnshops may request the competent authorities to introduce financial institutions to provide low-interest loans and may receive subsidies from the government for their operating expenses and part or all of the costs of repairing or rebuilding houses. The central or local government may award medals to rural pawnshops with well-organized operations and developed businesses to encourage them. In areas where rural pawnshops and branch pawnshops have already been established, rural pawnshops may not be established repeatedly unless the competent authority deems it necessary due to special needs. They are responsible for the safe keeping of pawned items. If pawned items are damaged due to negligence of duty, compensation should be paid at the current value. If stolen goods, appropriated items, or lost items are mistakenly accepted, the local competent authority should be notified for verification. Business operations may not be suspended unless there are special reasons and approval is obtained from the competent authority. The interest rates for pawned items are limited to the following: (1) Redemption interest is 1.6% per month, and storage fees are 8% per month. (2) The term is nine months. (3) The pawn ticket may be renewed upon expiration of the term. In addition, the style of pawn tickets is unified, with the name and address of the pawner, the name and quantity of the pawned item, the amount of the pawn, the storage location, and the expiration date noted on the pawn ticket.</p>
<h3>Authorities Paying Attention to Hoarding of Salt</h3>
<p>The salt, which is an essential seasoning for citizens, has recently caused public anxiety due to insufficient supply of spot goods. This phenomenon is said to be due to merchants shifting their focus, illegally hoarding, and attempting to raise prices for profit. The authorities are now paying close attention. According to a Shanghai News Agency reporter, spot goods shipped from the production area to Shanghai are still on their way. The authorities are providing practical assistance to stabilize the market and alleviate the suffering of the people. At the same time, anyone who illegally hoards salt can report it to the authorities.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market The Black Market Eliminated and Prices Gradually Recovering</p>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in Shanghai last week gradually recovered. Except for foreign currency, which was still fluctuating due to secret activities by speculators and non-industry people, changes in the market conditions of other industries seemed to have decreased slightly, and public panic was also disappearing. However, due to the authorities' crackdown on the black market, strict prohibition of illegal transactions, and the tense investigation of stockpiled materials in various warehouses in the city by the Materials Investigation Committee, the metropolis had a situation of high prices with little market. Therefore, the market prices of public bonds, cotton yarn, cloth, and various grains were all sluggish. Due to the imminent resumption of business by the Securities Exchange, stockbrokers were actively buying and selling, and trading was slightly lively, and market prices were also trending upward. Other items such as gold ornaments, silver ingots, military tickets, call loan interest, and the official prices of rice flour and miscellaneous grains remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pickled Vegetable Trade Association has been using large amounts of salt for the production and sale of pickled vegetables by its members. The Association has formally prepared a document and submitted it to the Municipal Food Bureau, requesting that it be forwarded to the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Bureau, requesting that the members of the Association be allocated salt by month and sold at official prices in order to maintain business operations and reduce production and sales costs, as well as to stabilize sales prices.</p>
<p>In order to increase production capacity, the Shanghai New Drug Trade Association has applied to relevant parties for an increase in electricity supply, and the matter is currently under consideration by relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Committee to Establish Cotton Public Warehouse</h3>
<p>According to sources, the Cotton Industry Committee is planning to establish a cotton public warehouse in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The planned capital is 10 million yuan, which will be invested by the Chinese and Japanese textile industries and cotton purchasing firms. In the future, all cotton stored in various regions will be purchased by the public warehouse. The textile industry in this city is facing a severe cotton shortage, with only one or two factories operating. Therefore, the industry is paying close attention to this measure.</p>
