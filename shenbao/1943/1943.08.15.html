<h3 id="c1">戰爭與革命 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>有革命約戰爭，有反革命的戰爭。前者是進步的戰爭，後　是阻碍進步的戰爭。</p>
<p>第－次大戰，同盟國與協約國的戰爭，是資本帝國主義侵奪殖民地的戰爭。因此在社會進化史上甚少革命的進步的章義。德國為了要向海外發展而與英國衝突，為了要向巴爾幹方要擴張而與俄國對立，為了要稱霸大陸而進兵法國，同盟國的戰爭目的，如此而已。至於協約國方面，也是一樣，他們雖然標榜為了世界和平，為了民主主義，然而戰爭勝利的結果，和平依然無望，過了二十年，第二次大戰又發生了。</p>
<p>但在第一次大戰中間，俄國革命到底給大戰具有若干進步的意義。共產黨將帝國主義間的戰爭轉化為革命的內戰，俄皇的專制政治給推翻了，俄國人民從此獲得解放。至於以後怎樣轉化為共產官僚的統治，以及斯太林個人的獨栽，那是另外的一回事。</p>
<p>世界資本主義的發展，原來是不均勻的。英美法是資本主義的先進，他們具有雄厚的金融資本及廣大的殖民地，他們是所謂「有」的國家，正如「千金之子，坐不垂堂」，所以主張「和平」，要求保持現狀。軸心國家資本主義的發展落後，沒有巨大的資本勢力，也沒有許多的殖民地，他們是「無」的國家，因此，他們主張建設新秩序。第二次大戰就是從道對立中發生出來的。</p>
<p>就蘇聯來說，他不蜀於這個系統，自有共社會主義的立塲。在這公本主義的世界，他因為自覺是一個異類的存在，深恐資本主義各國結成反共的十字軍，所以對於資本主義各國內部的對立，挑撥離間，惟恐戰事之不早日爆發。在這一點上，他是希望戰爭的，希望由戰爭來進行世界革命的。第二次大戰的發生，即由德蘇協定的成立，使德國感到從此沒有兩面作戰的危險，於是毅然進兵波蘭。但是同時，蘇聯有廣大的領土，豊富的資源，社會主義國家的建設正有待於「五年計盡」的實現。所以他在另一方面，又是主張和平的。當英法對德關係漸趨緊張的時候，他最初主張結成「人民陣錢」，繼則與英法代表從事軍事協定的談判。但是他還是為了不願因波蘭問題而與德國發生衝突，致受英法的利用。所以叉轉而與德相結。那知戰爭到了第三年，因為德國的用兵東綫，他到底叉不得不轉變方向而加入協約國的陣營了。</p>
<p>可是再轉變後的蘇聯，他與英美的關係決不是和好無間的。正如第一次轉變後他與德國的關係一樣，表面上雖使節往來，其買卻同床異萝。總之，英美有英美的目的，蘇聯也有共自己的野心。目前固尚未到破裂的時期，但由戰爭的發展，這個時期不久一定會到來的。我們由重慶最近的肆力反共，就可知英美與蘇聯間共暗流是如何。</p>
<p>上面是說蘇聯與這次戰爭的關係，然則就中國言，我們的立塲是怎樣呢？</p>
<p>百年以來，我們是被壓迫的民族，國民革命的目的，就在求得中國的獨立自由。所以我們對於戰爭的立塲應當是革命的，（求得民族解放）進步的（建設現代國家）。我們參加第一次大戰，為的要實現協約國所標榜的解放弱小民族的口號。但是戰爭結果，所解放的只是屬於德奧及俄國統治下之民族，例如印度，則到第二次大戰的第五年。革命領袖甘地，還給英帝國主義關在牢獄當中。印度之不願為英國而作戰是理所當然，而鮑斯之主張對英反抗乃人情之常。第一次大戰的結果，在我們中國是華府會議，九國公約，門戶開放，機會均等。這裹包含着英美與日本的衝突。就我們看來，日本的強盛由接受西洋文明，模倣歐美資本主義而來，日本之與英美，其不同的地方是在何處呢？由過去的許多事件，使一般中國人的心裹不勝疑慮。這種懷疑的心理，就是市中日全面和平所以到今日仍舊不克實現的一個重大原因。</p>
<p>但是申近衛宣言，日本已明自表示他對中國的態度，而最近的新政策，放棄阻界及治外法權，日本更有了對宜言的實踐。且如援助緬甸獨立及菲島自主，都足見日本政策與英美帝國主義有所不同。我們知道中日兩國，同處東亞，實在運命相同，且如印度也與我們有同樣的運命。亞洲三大國——中國•日本•印度，今印度已亡，中國貧弱，日本強盛，所以如此，無非因為歐洲資本帝國主義的侵略，印度先當其衝，中國次之，日本最後。中國若能脫離英美勢力的支配，印度必可繼起，獲得成功。可是中國若欲求得解放，那未由今日的情形實非先與日本成立和平，彼此協力不可。因此，中日和平可說是亞洲民族解放的關鍵。過去我們為保全國土而抗戰，可是從近衛聲明到大東亞戰爭發生，形勢已不相同。我們倘若要使這戰爭具有革命的進步的意義，那末今日殊應有全面的轉變。我們要以對日抗戰的力量用之於對日和平，恢復生產，建設國家。兩國之間所以迄今尚有許多不合理的現象存在，這乃是和平未會完成之故。</p>
<p>總之，這次戰爭，就資本主義方面看來是列強內部的利權爭奪戰，就蘇聯來說，這是一個進入世界革命的大好機會，戰事愈趨延長，他就可利用各國無產階級的勢力，來轉變戰爭的意義。至如我們，目的在求民族的獨立而建設國家，所以這戰爭在中國，應當是一個革命，以全國的生產階級為基礎，而求取政治的經濟的社會的解放。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日强大轟炸機編隊　猛炸達爾文港　襲破根維爾島布之敵機　遭迎頭痛擊損失三十四架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央計電　據新金山來電·西南太平洋麥克沃塞將軍司令部發表公報稱，強大之日轟炸機編隊，於昨日猛襲澳大利亞北部達爾文港之反軸心軍陣地，空襲詳情及損失程度，該公報並未提及。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本　十三日發表，帝國海軍航空部隊，入月十二日與來襲玻根維爾島布英之敵機五十五架以上交戰、當擊落其三十四架、餘即敗退、日　除有一架朱返外、地上亦略有輕微損害云。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十四日中央社電　最近美週刊雜誌泰晤士就美軍於新佐治亞島之苦戰情形報道如次，關於戰爭無進展之原因，吾人試觀以下之事實，當可瞭然，美陸上部隊指揮官、會期待以轟炸及砲學為步兵部隊開一不流血即循進展之路，但此期待則未實現，蒸日軍已　得多少耐炸之洞穴，此乃巧妙利用炸彈轟炸之巨坑、而築成之察固洞穴及圖頂避難壕，美軍倘欲進攻，則必須將此完全覆滅。日軍往往不畏犧牲，深入美軍陣地，美軍與此等狙攀兵交戰，其慘酷情形，實前所朱覓。且此等狙擊兵射擊為準確，因之美軍死傷者甚多，不慣於此等地區作戰之美兵，殊感痛苦。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　據此間軍事專家談，美軍自六月三下在倫特巴島方　登陸後，即企國奪囘磷接該島之新佐治亞島孟達，迄今歷時一月有半，日美雙方之戰鬥正日趨激烈，美軍雖集中新銳重火器，但在日陸海軍將士軍戰之創，不易完成其企圖，於是美軍或圖轟炸日軍後方陣地，或圖割斷海上日軍之接濟，尤以最近更總動員其新銳飛機，欲使孟達陷於孤立狀態，然日航空部隊早已洞燭共奸，乃先發制人，予以重創，自八月以來，如日大本營所發表者，已在倫特巴特港及其他等地炸沉美艦挺卅五艘，粉碎其空軍勢力，但美軍仍實行反攻作戰，如十二日白畫以飛機五十五架之大編隊來藝玻根維軍島之布英，日戰鬥機隊當即升空迎擊，擊落敵機三十四架，此次來襲之美機為統一式（B24）重轟炸機十二架，統式（P62y）飛機十二架及戰鬥機三十一架，美戰鬥機於空中全被殲減，日方僅有一架尚朱飛返，所獲戰果實極驚人，粽計美軍自開始奪囘孟達作戰以來，空襲布英前後共逢五次，所使用之飛機共計有五百餘架，其中被地上砲火擊落者實達一百六十入架之多</p>

<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>在新國民運動公務人員及青少年團署期集飄營講授新國民運動綱要，第一屆及第二屆均分三次講授，每次約一小時半，講授的大意是相同的，所不指間祇是觸類引申，詳言反覆，如今刪其繁，節其要，寫成此稿，以備諸生檢閱。　　　精衛自識</p>
<p>第一講大意</p>
<p>新國民運動網要，於中華民國三十一年元曰頒行，那時恰當大東亞戰爭發生不滿一月，我看到這是百年以來最緊要的關頭，同時最光榮的前途、也擺在前面。百年以來、英美懷着併吞世界的野心與慾望，挾其暴力與詐術，消減了美洲紅種，風分了非洲黑種，整個吞噬了澳洲棕色人種，亞洲黃色人種也被吞噬了一半，三萬萬多的印庇同胞，已成為俎上肉，全世界中所剩着的只有來亞了。這在英美如何肯單單放過，所以中國日本一齊遇着英美的壓迫，中國看看支持不住了，只有一個日本，將他抵住、這樣的苦苦抒扎了一百年，到了最近，才發生這樣決定生死存亡的戰爭，這決不是任何一國生死存亡的戰爭，而是整個東亞生死存亡的戰爭，換句話說，東亞民族如果不想隨着美洲紅種，非洲黑種、澳州棕色種，以及四亞的黃色同種之　·做英美的龍中鳥，　中　、憑他吞噬、憑他慢慢的阻嚼消化，那就只有一齊起來，和他拚一個你死我活。所謂最緊要的關頭在此，所謂最光榮的前途亦在此。東方叛逆的渝方，參加英美陣綫，口口聲聲說：「只有英美戰勝、中國才有前途」，如果掌美戰勝，中國有什麽前途呢？美洲紅種的前途，非洲黑種的前途，澳洲棕色種的前途、西亞黃色同種的前途。</p>
<p>殖民主義挑撥離間</p>
<p>百年以來，中國日本同受英美的壓迫，中國不幸積弱不振，只有日本臻於　盛，因為強弱不同，不免有許多摩擦，英美要利用這些摩擦，並且要這些摩擦加深加緊，於是造出許多挑撥離間的說話，最刻　的是：「中國與日本是永遠不能和好的，只有不斷的鬥爭，為什麽呢？因為日本強了，人口多了，需要土地，需要資源，只有取之於中國，才得滿足，中國如何受得了，所以中日衝突是無可避免的，無司調和的。「這－類話，充分表示了英美殖民地主義老的眼光。殖民地主義者的眼中，看不見入民，只看見土地，只看見資源。即使看見人民，也和看見地上的資源如牛馬之類一般，以為是沒靈魂的東西。可以供其榨取、榨取其汗，榨取共血與榨取牛馬的血汗無二、所以以己　度人之心，以為自己這樣做，日本也只有這樣做，自已和日本爭取中國做殖民地，很費力，拿這番說話激勵中國人與日本人的鬥爭。中國死，日本傷，他可不費力的將傷者致死，隨後將死者慢慢咀嚼，慢慢　化。這在英美真可能一舉兩得，最可恨的是有些自命智識階級的人們，平日以英美之是非為是非，凡是英美的說話，沒一句不是天經地義，英美說中日衝突無可避免，那真是無可避免了無可調和，那真是無可調和了，那麼，只有打到底了，這些自</p>
<p>英美勢力必歸崩潰　看啊！英國在此次戰爭中，已開始崩潰了，　着戰敗的結果，其勢力將崩潰無餘，即使不然，而英國與美國之鬥爭也事所必至，其結果亦只有同歸於崩潰。殖民地主義，看不見人，自然得不到入的擁體，所以其崩潰是必然性，兩個殖民地主義者相遏，各不相容，其同歸於崩潰也是必然性。</p>
<p>東亞共榮民族解放</p>
<p>東亞共榮主義，和殖地主義正是相反，殖民地主義者，看不見人，只看見土地，只看見資源；共榮主義者則不然，先看見人，認定人是有良心有人格的，入是自愛其國家，自愛其民族的，滿足其自愛其國家，自愛其民族的心，並且擴而大之，使之知道欲自保其國家，必共保宋亞，欲自保其民族，必共保東亞的全民族，這　以人的良心和入格，為一切原動力之本源，土地問題資源問題，就不雖得到合理的解決了。領土的野心，固不必有，即對於資源的需要亦可採用物物交易的方法，以達到長短相稱，有無相通之目的，持此與殖民地主義相較，殖民地全義者，不當人做人，沒有人的擁工，共榮主義者，當人做人，有人的擁護，其力量之大小厚工無可比工，所以殖民地主義者，與共榮主義者遇，必如落　邁風一掃而光。為什麽只標出東亞共榮主義配。因為現在未被英美看工者，只有東亞，東亞先自解放，再從英美口中，將已吞噬的美洲紅種，非洲黑種，澳洲棕色種，西亞黃色同種，一一掏了出來，共同得到解放。</p>
<p>日本獲得豐富資源</p>
<p>即以士地資源而論，共榮主義者所得，也非殖民地主義者可比，百多年以來，英美在南洋及東大平洋各羣島，實行殖民地主義，將土人當做牛馬，榨取其血汗，以開發土她，享受資源．如今其所開發的土地都B為日本所占領了，不但土地，連在土地上建築出來的鐵道，橋樑以及海濱的碼頭，都為日本所利用，土地上種出來的橡皮•金鷂納經咖啡，無窮無盡的榖米，土地下開掘出來的錫，及大量的汽油也都為日本所享受，英美昔日以土地廣大資源豐富自誇，如今這種誇稱只好拱手以讓之於入了。如果戰爭是　義土地和資源的話，那麼大東亞戰爭是　藉着最廣大的土地和最豐審的資源</p>
<p>以順待逆以逸待勞</p>
<p>「大東亞戰爭者大東亞戰爭也」這是說大東亞戰爭，只是大東亞的全民族團結起來，確保大東亞、並不是要越太平洋去攻取美國，越印度洋大西洋去攻取英國如果英美放不過東亞，定要越太平洋及印度洋大西洋而來，那麽，日本自大東亞戰爭以來，已將英美在東亞的根據地一概奪囘，一年有半以來，更將奪同來的根據地加以防禦，加以保障，以順待逆·以逸待勞，對於大東亞戰爭，穩操着必勝之勢，兼之東亞各國家各民族，在共熒主義之下團結起來、有了共榮主義做共同目的，以共同努力？其團結一致，更非英美任何勞力所能　之便散。反之英美任何勢力、在大東亞大團結之下，只有粉碎無餘。</p>
<p>英美詭計應知覺醒</p>
<p>英美不是嚷着歐洲第一嗎？如今方以全力企圖在歐洲登陸作戰，姑無論德國及其同盟國團結之麼，已非如上次歐洲大戰時•易為笑國花言巧語所搖惑，而且德國在土地方面及資源方面，也遠非上次歐洲大戰時可比，英美在歌洲登陸作戰沒有勝算，至少亦要經過長期戰爭，在這時候最無聊的是偷方了，據其所謂軍事說察團代表熊式輝的報吿：「美國租借法案，物資之分配，中國僅估百分之二」，「美國戰時生產雖然增加，但租借物資只佔戰時生產總額十二分之一，其餘十二分之十一，美國留為己用」，「據此，則中國所得租借物資，不過佔美國戰時生產全部六百分之一而已」。這是說明英美對於渝方之經視，雖欲利用渝方，多少牽掣日本，但是東亞是英美最後要吃的一塊肉，決不能任其強有力躬為東亞叛逆的渝方，於此也應知道覺　了。</p>
<p>團結一致前途光明</p>
<p>我們今日必須認定大東亞戰爭，是決定整個東亞存亡生死的最緊要的關頭，我們除了以未死的決心求同生•再沒有第二條出路，同時認定太東亞戰爭，已佔着必勝的地位•只要全東亞的民族團結一致，以促進光明前途之早日湧現。我們為什麽發起新國民運動呢？是要使中國成為東亞共榮　內一學強有力的國家，是要使我們成為這強有力的國家內一個強有力的分子。（第一講完）</p>

<p>滿洲國的金融新體制是：中央銀行成為發券銀行兼統制金融的買行機關，滿洲興業銀行為供給聞發產業資金的礦工金融機關，國內普通銀行及工商金繳合作社為一般工商金融機關，漸設的興農合作金康為農業金融檢關。遭據一個新體制，使滿洲國的中央銀行與金部金融機關取得密切聯繫，以中央銀行為中心，各向其所負使命之途邁進。</p>
<p>最　注意的是：關於中央銀行整理普通銀行業務的問題。滿洲國中央銀行則把重心放在確立金融機關業務的分野上，使其分別擔任重工業金融業〞，農埤金融業務，以及一般工商業的金融業務，而對於每一業務部門的金融機關，都能供給大量放款，俾向全國生產之途邁進。這樣一個性質的放款，真乃所謂供給銀行所需之正常頭寸了。</p>
<p>近傳中央儲備銀行為安定本市金融起見，對於各小銀行所需要於正當甲途之頭寸，繼續雜持供給，當然是金融界所最樂聞的。可是，不說正當頭寸　巳，否則我們即不能不認國內普通銀行，斤其小銀行的統合問題，以及整理普通銀行鶯務的問題，為值得我們嚴重考慮的。</p>

<p>檢查金融機關貸放</p>
<p>自江浙企業銀　　告暫停收聲之事發生後，中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處　派員檢查該行賬冊，同時並密切注意一般銀行業之動病，現已將調查銀行錢莊保險投姿企業等公司貸款狀况之工作辦理完畢幷將檢查情形報告財政部，內容略以過去金融機關之貸放，屬於囤積方面者，約達百分之六十　　放利率大都為月息三分至四分，囤積物資大部份為毛織品氣肥皂油類化學藥品人造絲等物．聞該處此次檢查在嚴密計　之下，探用迅　不及掩耳爭段，使各業無從隱蔽，故收教甚宏云。</p>

<p>There are revolutions that involve war, and there are counter-revolutions that involve war. The former is a progressive war, while the latter is a war that hinders progress.</p>
<p>The First World War, the war between the Allied Powers and the Entente Powers, was a war of capitalist imperialism to seize colonies. Therefore, there are very few revolutionary and progressive chapters in the history of social evolution. Germany clashed with Britain in order to expand overseas, confronted Russia in order to expand to the Balkans, and advanced into France in order to dominate the continent. Such were the war aims of the Allied Powers. As for the Entente Powers, it was the same. Although they claimed to be fighting for world peace and democracy, the result of the war was that peace remained elusive. Twenty years later, the Second World War broke out again.</p>
<p>However, during the First World War, the Russian Revolution did give the war some progressive significance. The Communist Party transformed the war between imperialists into a revolutionary civil war. The autocratic rule of the Russian Tsar was overthrown, and the Russian people were liberated from then on. As for how it later transformed into a communist bureaucratic rule and Stalin's personal dictatorship, that is another matter.</p>
<p>The development of world capitalism was originally uneven. Britain, the United States, and France were advanced in capitalism. They had strong financial capital and vast colonies. They were the so-called "haves," just like "the son of a wealthy man does not sit under a leaning eaves," so they advocated "peace" and demanded to maintain the status quo. The Axis countries lagged behind in the development of capitalism. They did not have huge capital power or many colonies. They were the "have-nots." Therefore, they advocated building a new order. The Second World War arose from this opposition.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, it did not belong to this system and had its own socialist stance. In this capitalist world, because it was aware of being a different kind of existence, it deeply feared that capitalist countries would form an anti-communist crusade. Therefore, it provoked and alienated the internal conflicts of capitalist countries, fearing that war would not break out soon enough. On this point, it hoped for war, hoping to carry out a world revolution through war. The outbreak of the Second World War was due to the establishment of the German-Soviet Pact, which made Germany feel that there was no danger of fighting on two fronts from then on, so it resolutely advanced into Poland. However, at the same time, the Soviet Union had vast territory, abundant resources, and the construction of a socialist country was awaiting the realization of the "Five-Year Plan." Therefore, on the other hand, it also advocated peace. When the relationship between Britain and France and Germany gradually became tense, it initially advocated forming a "People's Front," and then engaged in military agreement negotiations with British and French representatives. However, it still did not want to conflict with Germany over the Polish issue and be used by Britain and France. So, it turned to ally with Germany. Who knew that in the third year of the war, because Germany used its troops on the Eastern Front, it ultimately had to change direction and join the Allied camp.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union after the transformation was by no means on good terms with Britain and the United States. Just like its relationship with Germany after the first transformation, although there were envoys going back and forth on the surface, they were actually sleeping in the same bed with different dreams. In short, Britain and the United States had their own purposes, and the Soviet Union also had its own ambitions. Currently, it has not yet reached the point of rupture, but judging from the development of the war, this period will definitely come soon. From the recent unrestrained anti-communism in Chongqing, we can know how turbulent the undercurrents between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are.</p>
<p>The above is about the Soviet Union's relationship with this war. Then, as far as China is concerned, what is our stance?</p>
<p>For a hundred years, we have been an oppressed nation. The purpose of the National Revolution is to seek China's independence and freedom. Therefore, our stance on war should be revolutionary (seeking national liberation) and progressive (building a modern country). We participated in the First World War in order to realize the slogan of liberating small and weak nations advocated by the Allied Powers. However, as a result of the war, only the nations under the rule of Germany, Austria, and Russia were liberated. For example, in India, in the fifth year of the Second World War, revolutionary leader Gandhi was still imprisoned by British imperialism. It is only natural that India is unwilling to fight for Britain, and it is only human nature that Bose advocates resistance against Britain. The result of the First World War in our China was the Washington Conference, the Nine-Power Treaty, open door policy, and equal opportunity. This contains the conflict between Britain, the United States, and Japan. As we see it, Japan's strength comes from accepting Western civilization and imitating European and American capitalism. Where is the difference between Japan and Britain and the United States? Many past events have caused many Chinese people to feel doubtful. This kind of skeptical mentality is a major reason why a comprehensive peace between China and Japan has not been realized to this day.</p>
<p>However, in the recent Konoe Statement, Japan has clearly expressed its attitude towards China, and in its recent new policy, abandoning concessions and extraterritorial rights, Japan has further implemented its declaration. Moreover, such as assisting Myanmar's independence and the Philippines' autonomy, all show that Japan's policy is different from British and American imperialism. We know that China and Japan are both in East Asia and share the same destiny, and India has the same destiny as us. Among the three major Asian countries—China, Japan, and India—India has now fallen, China is poor and weak, and Japan is strong. The reason for this is nothing more than the invasion of European capitalist imperialism. India bore the brunt, followed by China, and finally Japan. If China can break away from the control of British and American forces, India will surely rise up and succeed. However, if China wants to achieve liberation, it is actually impossible to establish peace with Japan and cooperate with each other given the current situation. Therefore, peace between China and Japan can be said to be the key to the liberation of Asian nations. In the past, we resisted Japan in order to protect our territory, but from the Konoe Statement to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation has changed. If we want to give this war revolutionary and progressive significance, then there should be a comprehensive transformation today. We must use the strength of resisting Japan for peace with Japan, restore production, and build the country. The reason why there are still many unreasonable phenomena between the two countries is that peace has not been achieved.</p>
<p>In short, this war, from the perspective of capitalism, is a struggle for interests among the great powers. As for the Soviet Union, this is a great opportunity to enter the world revolution. The longer the war goes on, the more it can use the power of the proletariat in various countries to transform the meaning of the war. As for us, our goal is to seek national independence and build the country. Therefore, this war in China should be a revolution, based on the productive class of the whole country, and seeking political, economic, and social liberation.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Powerful Japanese Bomber Squadrons Bomb Darwin Port Vigorously Attacked and Broke Enemy Aircraft at Bogenville Island Suffered a Head-on Blow Losing Thirty-Four Aircraft <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) According to a telegram from New Gold Mountain, the Southwest Pacific General MacArthur Headquarters issued a public announcement stating that powerful Japanese bomber squadrons fiercely attacked the anti-Axis forces in Darwin Port, northern Australia, yesterday. The public announcement did not mention details of the air raid and the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 13th that the Imperial Naval Air Force engaged more than 55 enemy aircraft invading Bogenville Island on the 12th of this month, shooting down 34 of them. The remaining aircraft retreated in defeat. It is reported that only one Japanese aircraft failed to return, and there was also slight damage on the ground.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 14th (Central News Agency) The American weekly magazine "Times" recently reported on the fierce battle of the American army on New Georgia Island as follows: Regarding the reason for the lack of progress in the war, we can understand it by observing the following facts. The commander of the American ground forces expected to use bombing and artillery to open a bloodless path of progress for the infantry, but this expectation was not realized. The Japanese army has already obtained many blast-resistant caves. They cleverly used the huge pits created by bombing to build solid caves and bunker shelters. If the American army wants to attack, it must completely destroy them. Japanese soldiers often fearlessly penetrate into American positions at the cost of their lives. The cruelty of the American army fighting with these snipers is unprecedented. Moreover, these snipers shoot accurately, resulting in many American casualties. American soldiers who are not accustomed to fighting in these areas feel particularly miserable.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) According to military experts here, since the American army landed on Renterba Island on June 3rd, they have been trying to recapture Munda on New Georgia Island, which is adjacent to the island. Half a month has passed, and the battle between Japan and the United States is intensifying. Although the American army has concentrated new and heavy firepower, it is not easy to achieve its aims due to the war waged by Japanese army and navy soldiers. Therefore, the American army either attempts to bomb the rear positions of the Japanese army or attempts to cut off the Japanese army's supply at sea. In particular, they have recently mobilized their new aircraft in an attempt to isolate Munda. However, the Japanese air force had already foreseen the enemy's plot and preemptively inflicted heavy damage on them. Since August, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, 35 American ships have been sunk in Lenterbate Port and other places, and its air force has been shattered. However, the American army is still carrying out counter-attacks. For example, on the 12th, a large squadron of 55 aircraft attacked Buin on Bogenville Island during the daytime. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately took off to intercept them, shooting down 34 enemy aircraft. The American aircraft that came to attack this time included 12 unified-type (B24) heavy bombers, 12 unified-type (P62y) aircraft, and 31 fighter aircraft. All the American fighters were annihilated in the air. Only one Japanese aircraft failed to return. The results obtained were extremely astonishing. In total, since the American army began the operation to recapture Munda, it has launched five air raids on Buin, using a total of more than 500 aircraft, of which as many as 160 aircraft were shot down by ground fire.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Seminar Held by the Propaganda Department to Discuss Emergency Economic Measures <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) After the Supreme National Defense Conference passed the case of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth on the 9th, the National Government's wartime economic measures have entered the implementation stage. In order to gather ideas and cooperate with the government to promote economic policies, the Propaganda Department held a seminar on emergency economic measures at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association yesterday morning at 10:00 am, inviting officials from relevant government agencies and economic experts to participate in the seminar.</p>
<p>Those present included Tao Guoxian of the Ministry of Industry, Sui Gongbo of the Ministry of Finance, Tao Xinghao, Yin Yiheng of the Ministry of Food, Liu Bo, Xue Feng, Wang Yanzhou, and representatives from the Central News Agency and various newspapers in Peiping, totaling more than 20 people. Vice Minister Guo of the Propaganda Department also attended. Director Huang Zhaosheng of the Guidance Department of the Propaganda Department presided over the meeting and reported the significance of convening the seminar.</p>
<p>Then, the seminar began. The economic experts successively expressed their opinions on the outline of the seminar. Finally, Vice Minister Guo delivered a speech, and Director Huang delivered the closing remarks. The meeting ended at about 12:00 pm. The discussion outline of the seminar on emergency economic measures is attached below: (A) Regarding the National Government's issue of purchasing yarn and cloth: What is the impact of the National Government's ban on speculative purchases of yarn and cloth on the economy? (A) Prices, (B) Finance. Is the price of one thousand yuan per package reasonable for this purchase of yarn and cloth? (A) The basis for determining the standard, (B) Whether there is any loss to legitimate business. How should the purchased yarn and cloth be used to increase production and improve people's livelihood? How will this government's strengthening of material management change China's economic thoughts? (1) Liberal economic thought, (2) Planned economic thought. How should all the people cooperate to promote economic measures? (B) Regarding the food issue: After our country joined the Greater East Asia War, in order to adapt to the wartime system and achieve the goal of victory, the most important thing is to have sufficient food preparation. What are the methods to increase production? The control of food is a necessary means to control production, adjust surpluses and shortages, control prices, and stabilize people's livelihood during wartime. How should the control mechanism be reformed so that the people can receive real benefits? The conservation of food, during this wartime period, requires storing grain for famine relief and supplying food to the front lines. How should the people in the rear make efforts to conserve food in order to strengthen the war effort? However, at this time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, the people have already saved on their own, but how to make the distribution fair? Food shortages, every time the grain is running low, the inventory is scarce, and the source is lacking, the people's food in various places cannot be as plentiful as usual. How should we adjust to seek active remedies? High food prices. The prices of rice and grain in various places (excluding publicly sold rice) are determined by supply and demand relationships, and market prices are not easy to unify. Farmers naturally hope to sell at a good price, regardless of the difficulties, secretly transporting and selling. Unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to make profits. How to prevent this?</p>

They are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 15th and are expected to stay in Japan for three weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e14">US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Repeatedly Attacked by Japanese Army Attempts to Attack Japan Were Completely Smashed <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing used various places in Chongqing as bases to organize the US 14th Air Force in March this year. Since then, it has repeatedly attempted to strengthen its air force strength. At the same time, US Stilwell and Chennault left Chongqing and returned to the United States, maintaining close contact with the US authorities. They returned to Chongqing in June. At that time, Chennault had boasted that he was confident in the air war against Japan, and said that if he could have 500 aircraft, he could drive the Japanese army out of China. However, his request for reinforcements from the United States did not come true. It was only said that the remaining forces of Seessel's unit stationed in India's 10th Air Force were transferred, and a number of aircraft were obtained from the United States for reinforcements. Moreover, he planned to incorporate the air force personnel sent by Chongqing to the United States for training into the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing for replenishment. Furthermore, they supplemented aircraft fuel, bombs, and other items at the forward bases of Jianyang, Lingling, Hengyang, and Guilin, preparing to air raid the Japanese mainland. However, the Japanese Air Force had already detected this and suddenly bombed the enemy's forward bases on July 23, inflicting heavy damage on them. The enemy's losses reached 44 aircraft, and the fuel used for replenishment was either consumed in air combat or escaped, and the resources were almost exhausted. Therefore, Chennault's previous exaggeration has come to nothing. The enemy's US Air Force also had to marvel at the bravery and excellent performance of the Japanese Air Force in combat. However, the enemy has not yet given up the idea of ​​air raiding the Japanese mainland. It is said that the enemy's US military has recently been quite active, transporting slow food and other materials by air from India and the Northwest Line, attempting to continue to act recklessly. However, the Japanese army has made complete preparations to crush the enemy's US military's reckless actions and to grasp the air supremacy of the Chinese mainland, and the enemy air force's attempts will definitely be difficult to succeed.</p>

<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency Telegram) Colonel Hama, a military reporter accompanying the German News Agency on the Eastern Front, said: The battle to defend the area south of Lake Ladoga resumed on Friday. At that time, the Soviet army again launched a large-scale attack on the east of the Leningrad encirclement. The Soviet army first prepared with urgent artillery fire, and then mobilized several newly arrived infantry divisions to join the battle, with strong aircraft and tank formations as cover. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy army broke through the German front line in two places, but the German army immediately counterattacked and sealed off the breakthroughs. During this battle, the Soviet army lost ten tanks, seven of which were destroyed by the German army units of the East Prussian Grenadiers. At the same time, the Soviet army also launched a heavy attack on the Kuban bridgehead west of Krymskaya, but in the German counterattack, the Soviet army was repelled along the entire front, losing a large number of war equipment and suffering heavy casualties. The Romanian infantry assault team annihilated a Soviet battalion, and its contribution was particularly commendable. In the Milos district, Romanian bombers achieved outstanding success by bombing Soviet concentration points and artillery positions.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 14th (Central News Agency) The Soviet army on the Bryansk front is plotting to seize the outer perimeter positions of the German army east of the area, Kalajiv, and is launching deadly attacks from the east and west sides. The Soviet army's frontal units, which have repeatedly launched attacks, have been blocked four and a half miles east of Kalajiv. The southern troops encountered a fierce German attack at Dopatrovsk, 40 miles from Kalajiv, and fell into a state of fierce fighting. According to a Reuters report, the Soviet army in that area has abandoned its attempt to attack Bryansk since the 13th, and advanced 10 miles along the Nerlya, with the direct goal of breaking through the Bryansk-Kakov railway, apparently trying to cut off the railway between Bryansk and Gonotob. According to frontline reports from the General Army, the Soviet army on the Bryansk front has recently been rapidly declining in armored warfare, and may be shifting its main force to the Smolensk area.</p>
<p>Moscow, 14th (Central News Agency) The Soviet Information Bureau announced on the 13th that the Soviet army, in response to the central battle money, launched an offensive against Smolensk from the Yazerva and Yulof areas. It has started since the 11th, and a large-scale offensive has been launched again in the Spas-Demensk region, 130 kilometers east of Smolensk, and the Minsk region. The communiqué stated that the offensive has begun in the northwest and southeast of Basdie and Minsk. The Soviet army's attack is divided into two sides. The Soviet army west of Spas-Demensk and Minsk is attacking south, while the Soviet army southeast is attacking north.</p>

<p>Lisbon, August 14th, Central News Agency dispatch: A message from Quebec states that the American military delegation attending the Quebec Conference arrived in the city yesterday afternoon and immediately began discussions with British and Canadian leaders. It is widely believed that since the arrival of these military dignitaries, preliminary issues before the opening of the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference have been resolved, dispelling all doubts regarding the conference. Canadian military leaders will hold equal status with British and American leaders during the conference. This implies that Canada will participate in similar future conferences with equal cooperative standing. Canadian sources point out that given the importance of Canadian troops on the European battlefield, Canada is entitled to this preferential treatment. The American military delegation includes: Admiral William Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Roosevelt; General George Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army; Admiral Ernest King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet; General Henry Arnold, Commander of the Army Air Forces; and General Brehon Somervell. It is reported that the delegation members arrived individually and were greeted by numerous representatives of the Canadian government at an undisclosed location, before being led to the Citadel to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King.</p>
<p>Lisbon, August 14th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from London, Monte Mowbray, diplomatic correspondent for the London Chronicle News, argued today against TASS's claim that the Soviet Union was not invited to the Quebec Conference, stating that since Prime Minister Churchill's visit to Moscow a year ago, Stalin has had a standing invitation to meet with Roosevelt and Churchill. Therefore, London officials consider Moscow's deliberate arguments about the Anglo-American conference to be unreasonable.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Stalin's Absence: British Government Issues Statement <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, August 14th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from London, the British government issued a statement today regarding the failure to invite Stalin to the Quebec Conference. The statement roughly explains that the news released by TASS about the non-invitation of Stalin was due to a misunderstanding. The reason the Allied powers did not send an invitation to the Soviet Union was to avoid precluding the participation of other Soviet representatives. Regardless of the origin of this misinformation, there are absolutely no disagreements between the British, American, and Soviet governments. The Soviet Union is unlikely to harbor any suspicion about the Quebec Conference; Stalin was informed of the conference's agenda in advance, even though he was not invited to attend.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, August 14th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Soviet TASS news agency issued a special statement on the night of the 12th, saying that Stalin was not invited to attend the Quebec talks from the beginning, and that the Soviet government decided not to send a representative due to the nature of the talks. A New York Times correspondent in Washington stated that Roosevelt's remarks during a meeting with a group of reporters gave the impression that Roosevelt had invited the Soviet government to participate, but was rejected by Stalin. The release of this statement by TASS has caused a great stir in American political circles. Furthermore, American newspapers and radio stations have immediately shifted their propaganda focus based on the TASS release, stating that the main goal of the Quebec talks is to review the Pacific problem. A United Press International dispatch from Washington also conveyed that Washington political circles believe that the main topic of the conference will be the Pacific counter-offensive and armistice. The Washington Star reported that Roosevelt and Churchill may collaborate on promoting a plan for the Pacific War.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, August 14th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from New York, a New York Times correspondent in Washington claimed yesterday that any talk of British Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Moscow is premature. The correspondent stated that he learned from well-informed sources that Eden might attend the Quebec Conference before departing for Moscow. However, if the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference has concluded before Eden arrives in Quebec, then Eden will go to Washington to obtain instructions related to negotiations with the Soviet government.</p>

<p>Berne, August 14th, Central News Agency dispatch: A Columbia Broadcasting System correspondent in London stated today that a very important Soviet official will arrive in London in September. This news has caused a stir in Washington and London. However, the correspondent did not provide any further details. Some say this report is intended to quell external criticism of the British and American governments for failing to invite Stalin to the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference.</p>

<p>Geneva, August 13th, Central News Agency dispatch: A German news agency reports from Washington that the Argentine Ambassador to the United States, Don Adrián César Escobar, has protested to U.S. Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles about "the Washington Post's severe criticism of Argentina's neutrality as insincere and vacillating." During the meeting with the U.S. Under Secretary of State, the ambassador strongly argued that such claims do not help resolve inter-American issues and stated that his government's neutrality policy does not violate the Rio de Janeiro treaty. He emphasized that in the past few days, the Argentine government has particularly dedicated itself to inter-American cooperation, a fact that should not be ignored.</p>

<p>Berlin, August 13th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a Reuters military correspondent, Mr. Sertorius, the withdrawal and consolidation of the Axis bridgehead in Sicily are progressing steadily. Large-scale battles in the northern and central parts of the island are not hindering this process. The advance of the U.S. Seventh Army on the left flank in the Naso area has slowed down. There have been no changes in the east of Bronte and the west of Raddusa in recent days. Although the enemy concentrated artillery to prepare to break through the line between Nicosia and Aetna, their attempt ultimately failed. The Allied artillery is becoming more active. General Montgomery is strengthening the right flank of the Eighth Army by increasing pressure along the coastal highway from the east. His actions are often supported by artillery, aircraft, and naval forces. However, the German rearguard is successfully protecting the retreat of the German-Italian Allied forces. The German Air Force bombed enemy air bases on Wednesday, causing Allied air activity to gradually weaken.</p>
<p>Berlin, August 14th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a German news agency citing military sources here, British, American, and Canadian forces are repeatedly attempting to break the German defense line in the central area of the Sicilian front. After suffering heavy losses in the past two weeks due to attempts to make a major breakthrough in the Axis line in this area, the enemy is now relying on the assistance of artillery and bomber squadrons. For several days, the enemy has continuously shelled presumed German positions with intense artillery fire for several hours before launching an offensive. However, the German troops are holding deep, hardened trenches that are not threatened by enemy artillery fire. In addition, lemon trees and fruit trees provide excellent cover against enemy bombers and low-flying enemy air squadrons. The enemy's hope of weakening the Axis forces' defense capabilities to reduce their own losses has completely failed. During one continuous shelling lasting three and a half hours, only four German soldiers were injured. Three of them were slightly injured and remained with the army. In another area, the German troops suffered no casualties. After a large-scale, intense bombing, British, American, and Canadian forces attempted to assault the high ground held by German troops but were repelled by the defending forces' firepower, suffering heavy losses and retreating to their original positions without gain. On Thursday, German Göring division units defended the valley positions and launched strong counterattacks, inflicting very heavy casualties on several enemy units.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Outline of the New National Movement <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>The outline of the New National Movement was lectured in the summer training camps for public officials and youth groups of the New National Movement. The first and second sessions were each lectured three times, each time about one and a half hours. The general idea of the lectures was the same, only differing in terms of elaboration and repetition. Now, I have condensed its complexity and extracted its essence, writing this draft for the perusal of students. Jingwei, Self-awareness</p>
<p>Main Idea of the First Lecture</p>
<p>The Outline of the New National Movement was promulgated in January of the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942]. At that time, the Great East Asia War had just begun less than a month ago. I saw that this was the most critical juncture in a century, and at the same time, the most glorious future was also placed before us. For a century, Britain and the United States, harboring the ambition and desire to annex the world, used their violence and deceit to eliminate the Red Indians of the Americas, divided the Black Africans, and completely swallowed the Brown people of Australia. Half of the Yellow race of Asia was also swallowed. More than 300 million Indian compatriots have become meat on the chopping block. Of the entire world, only Asia remains. How could Britain and the United States simply let that go? So China and Japan together faced the oppression of Britain and the United States. China looked like it could no longer hold on, so there was only Japan, resisting them. After struggling so hard for a century, this war that decides life and death has finally occurred. This is by no means a war of life and death for any one country, but a war of life and death for the entire East Asia. In other words, if the East Asian nations do not want to follow the Red Indians of the Americas, the Black Africans, the Brown people of Australia, and the Yellow race of Western Asia, becoming birds in the cages of Britain and the United States, allowing them to swallow us, to slowly chew and digest us, then they have no choice but to rise up together and fight them to the death. This is what is meant by the most critical juncture, and this is what is meant by the most glorious future. The rebellious party of the East, participating in the British and American camp, keeps saying, "Only if Britain and the United States win will China have a future." If Britain and the United States win, what future will China have? The future of the Red Indians of the Americas, the future of the Black Africans, the future of the Brown people of Australia, and the future of the Yellow race of West Asia.</p>
<p>Colonialism Provokes Discord</p>
<p>For a century, China and Japan have suffered under the oppression of Britain and the United States. China unfortunately has been weak and declining, while only Japan has reached prosperity. Because of the difference in strength, many frictions are inevitable. Britain and the United States want to take advantage of these frictions, and want these frictions to deepen and intensify. So they create many provocative and divisive statements. The most cutting statement is: "China and Japan can never be reconciled. They can only engage in constant struggle. Why? Because Japan is strong, and its population is large. It needs land, and it needs resources. It can only take these from China in order to satisfy its needs. How can China withstand that? So, Sino-Japanese conflict is unavoidable and irreconcilable." This type of statement fully demonstrates the old perspective of British and American colonialism. In the eyes of colonialists, they do not see people, they only see land, they only see resources. Even if they see people, they see them like the resources on the ground, like cattle and horses, thinking that they are soulless things that can be exploited. Their sweat can be extracted, their blood can be extracted, just like extracting the blood and sweat of cattle and horses. So, taking their own mentality as a standard to measure others, they think that since they do this, Japan can only do this as well. It takes a lot of effort for them to fight with Japan over colonizing China, so they use these words to incite the struggle between Chinese and Japanese people. If China dies and Japan is wounded, then they can effortlessly kill the wounded, and then slowly chew on the dead, slowly digesting them. This is truly a win-win situation for Britain and the United States. The most hateful thing is that some people who call themselves intellectuals, who usually take the right and wrong of Britain and the United States as their own, believe that everything Britain and the United States say is irrefutably true. Britain and the United States say that Sino-Japanese conflict is unavoidable, then it is truly unavoidable. It is irreconcilable, then it is truly irreconcilable. So, the only thing to do is to fight to the end. These people who think of themselves</p>
<p>The Power of British and American Forces Will Surely Collapse Look, Britain has already begun to collapse in this war. Following the result of defeat, its power will collapse completely. Even if that does not happen, the struggle between Britain and the United States is inevitable. Its result will only be mutual collapse. Colonialism cannot see people, so it naturally cannot get the support of the people. So its collapse is inevitable. Two colonialists restrain each other, incompatible with each other, so their mutual collapse is also inevitable.</p>
<p>East Asian Co-Prosperity and National Liberation</p>
<p>East Asian co-prosperity is the opposite of colonialism. Colonialists do not see people, they only see land, they only see resources. Co-prosperity advocates are different. They see people first, recognizing that people have conscience and personality, and that people love their own country and their own nation. They satisfy the hearts of those who love their own country and their own nation, and expand upon them, making them understand that in order to protect their own country, they must jointly protect East Asia. In order to protect their own nation, they must jointly protect the entire nation of East Asia. This takes the conscience and personality of people as the source of all driving forces. The problem of land and the problem of resources can then be rationally resolved. The ambition for territory is unnecessary. Even the need for resources can adopt the method of barter in order to achieve long-term balance and mutual exchange of what is needed. Compared with colonialism, the colonialists do not treat people as people and do not have the support of the people. Co-prosperity advocates treat people as people and have the support of the people. The magnitude of their power is incomparable. So when colonialists meet co-prosperity advocates, they will be swept away like fallen leaves in a storm. Why only mark out East Asian co-prosperity? Because at present, the only ones who have not been swallowed by Britain and the United States are in East Asia. East Asia will first liberate itself, and then, from the mouths of Britain and the United States, take out one by one the Red Indians of the Americas, the Black Africans, the Brown people of Australia, and the Yellow race of West Asia who have already been swallowed, and jointly achieve liberation.</p>
<p>Japan Obtains Abundant Resources</p>
<p>Even in terms of land and resources, what co-prosperity advocates obtain is not comparable to what colonialists obtain. For more than a hundred years, Britain and the United States have practiced colonialism in Southeast Asia and various islands of the East Pacific, treating the natives as cattle and horses, extracting their blood and sweat to develop the land and enjoy the resources. Now, the land they have developed has all been occupied by Japan. Not only the land, but even the railways, bridges, and coastal docks built on the land are being used by Japan. The rubber, quinine, coffee, and endless grains grown on the land, as well as the tin and large amounts of gasoline extracted from under the land, are all being enjoyed by Japan. Britain and the United States used to boast of vast land and abundant resources, but now this boasting has to be handed over to others. If the war is about land and resources, then the Great East Asia War is about relying on the broadest land and the most abundant resources</p>
<p>To Await the Unfavorable with Ease and Await the Laborious with Leisure</p>
<p>"The Great East Asia War is the Great East Asia War." This means that the Great East Asia War is only the entire nation of the Great East uniting to ensure the Great East Asia. It is not about going across the Pacific to attack the United States, or going across the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean to attack the Great Britain. If the United States and Great Britain cannot let go of East Asia, and must come across the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, then since the Great East Asia War, Japan has already taken back all the bases of the United States and Great Britain in East Asia. For a year and a half, it has been defending and guaranteeing the bases it has taken back. To await the unfavorable with ease and await the laborious with leisure. The Great East Asia War is steadily holding a winning hand. In addition, the various countries and nations of East Asia are uniting under co-prosperity. With co-prosperity as a common goal, with common effort, their unity is something that no amount of effort from the British and Americans can break up. On the contrary, any force from the British and Americans, under the great unity of the Great East Asia, can only be crushed without a trace.</p>
<p>The British and American Schemes Should Be Known and Awakened</p>
<p>Aren't the British and Americans clamoring for Europe first? Now they are trying with all their strength to land and fight in Europe. Regardless of how united Germany and its allies are, they are no longer as easily swayed by the sweet talk of the Allies as they were during the last European war. Furthermore, Germany's land and resources are also far from comparable to those of the last European war. The British and American landing operations in Europe have no chance of success. At the very least, they will have to go through a long war. At this time, the most bored is the opposite party. According to the report of the so-called military inspection group representative Xiong Shihui, "The distribution of materials under the American Lend-Lease Act allocated only 2% to China," "Although wartime production in the United States has increased, Lend-Lease materials only account for one-twelfth of total wartime production, and the remaining eleven-twelfths are kept by the United States for its own use," "Based on this, the Lend-Lease materials received by China only account for one-six-hundredth of total wartime production in the United States." This shows the British and American disregard for the opposing party. Although they want to use the opposing party to restrain Japan to some extent, East Asia is the last piece of meat that the British and Americans want to eat. They must not allow the opposing party, who has the strength, to actively be the rebel of East Asia. The opposing party should also know and be aware of this.</p>
<p>Unite as One, the Future is Bright</p>
<p>Today, we must recognize that the Great East Asia War is the most critical juncture that determines the survival and death of the entire East Asia. Apart from seeking common life with the determination not to die, we have no other way out. At the same time, we must recognize that the Great East Asia War has already occupied a winning position. As long as the nations of the entire East Asia unite as one to promote the early emergence of a bright future. Why do we launch the New National Movement? It is to make China a strong and powerful country within East Asian co-prosperity. It is to make us a strong and powerful member within this strong and powerful country. (End of Lecture One)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Gauze Purchasing Office to Formally Open Tomorrow, Mr. Nie Employed as Director, Cao Boquan as Deputy, Mr. Cao's Letter of Resignation Already Submitted to the Trade Control Commission <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control Association, upon order to handle matters related to existing cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai, has already drafted detailed rules for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth. It was submitted to and passed by a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, resolving to establish a Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office, appointing Mr. Nie as director and Cao Boquan as deputy director, with full authority and exclusive responsibility for handling the matter. It is learned that the office will be formally established tomorrow (the 16th). The internal organization is divided into five sections, managing all affairs, including: the first section managing documents, general affairs, personnel, and liaison with related organizations; the second section managing the recording of cotton yarn and cloth purchase amounts and prices; the third section managing the examination and calculation of cotton yarn and cloth purchase applications; the fourth section managing the inspection of cotton yarn and cloth quality and quantity; and the fifth section managing the handling, transshipment, and storage of purchased cotton yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Mr. Nie's Resignation Letter</p>
<p>After the National Government announced the cotton yarn and cloth purchasing decree, it simultaneously designated the National General Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control Association to be responsible for handling the purchasing matters. The Trade Control Association felt the significant responsibility and was extremely cautious about the selection of the person in charge, with consideration given to those in the yarn and cloth industry who were well-respected and of high character. It was heard that yarn industry leader Mr. Nie had been employed as the director of the Gauze Purchasing Office, but Mr. Nie was currently submitting his resignation. It has now been learned that Mr. Nie has submitted his letter of resignation to the Trade Control Association, the original text of which is as follows: "Respected Sir: Yesterday, I received your letter of August 12th, employing Nie to serve as the director of your Association's gauze purchasing office. Upon hearing the order, I felt nothing but ashamed. I think that Nie's talent and knowledge are mediocre, and his nature is foolishly straightforward. In recent years, I have not engaged in external affairs and have kept a low profile. This year, I have been erroneously selected by fellow industry members to serve as the chairman of the Joint Association, but I have declined to no avail. After taking office for several months, I have made no contributions whatsoever. I have not been able to repay your Association above, and I have not been able to answer to my fellow industry members within. Thinking about it late at night, I feel deeply ashamed and disgusted. The gauze purchase has been passed by the Highest National Defense Conference, and the vastness of the affairs and the magnitude of the responsibilities are self-evident. One must be rich in textile knowledge and full of energy to be able to preside over it, which is definitely not something that an unlearned, unskilled, and mediocre person like Nie can be competent to do. I respectfully request your Association to withdraw the appointment and re-employ an expert, so as not to delay the major national plan, and I sincerely pray for it. I respectfully return the letter of appointment, and I hope that you will be kind enough to accept it. I am infinitely sincere. This is respectfully presented to Mr. Tang, Chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control Association. Respectfully, Nie."</p>

<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee is implementing unified flour allocation. The allocation quantities for various regions have been decided, and the five regions of Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Changzhou have already begun implementation. Flour manufacturers are allocated flour according to the daily allocation quantities and are required to take a legal profit of two percent on the allocation price when selling (the previous report of twenty percent was a rumor). The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has sent letters to branch offices in various regions to forward to the flour mills for compliance, and they must not take profits in excess of this amount.</p>

<p>The long-term broadcast lecture of the Municipal Propaganda Department was broadcast last night by Director Fan of the Shanghai Special Municipal Land Administration Bureau, titled "Reflections on the Recovery of the Concessions." Excerpts from the broadcast are as follows:</p>
<p>Now that the two concessions have been recovered, we should automatically care about municipal administration and do our best to assist the government, or at any time examine the facts in detail, distinguish between right and wrong, and contribute constructive opinions to the Municipal Bureau to ease the gap. We must work together after the recovery of the concessions and evenly develop the entire Shanghai City, so that the citizens of Shanghai are not concentrated in a small area.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Sixth Round of Rationed Sugar: Purchase Certificates to Be Issued Starting Tomorrow <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The sixth round of rationed sugar in this city has been allocated by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office. It is now scheduled to issue purchase certificates on the 16th and 17th of this month. Each licensed retailer of rationed goods should stamp and clarify the blank vouchers previously issued by the office on the 16th and 17th, in order to obtain purchase certificates. Payment should be made to the designated sugar firm before the 18th of this month in order to pick up the goods. As for Group One users (i.e., former Class B retailers), the office is currently reorganizing them and will notify them within days to exchange for purchase certificates.</p>
<p>Future Land Administration</p>
<p>As for the land administration aspects of Shanghai, such as the issuance of property ownership certificates and the collection of land taxes, regardless of whether it is in the concession or non-concession area, since the recovery, they are all handled by the Central Government's Committee. At present, the issuance of land certificates to the Chinese people, the leasing of land to foreigners, and the registration of transfers, mortgages, and surface rights or other rights, which are all fully managed by the Land Administration Bureau, are still being carried out in accordance with the printed laws, regulations, and unified procedures. Since it is often mistaken that the land in the concession has never belonged to Chinese administration, it is included as a supplementary explanation.</p>

<p>Regarding the 44th period of rationed rice, according to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, it has been decided by the Rice Adjustment Committee that the First District Public Office Rice Flour Distribution Office will issue physical vouchers to rice shops yesterday. However, because yesterday was Saturday, the Rice Flour Distribution Office did not work in the afternoon, so the rice vouchers for this period will actually have to be issued to rice shops in the first and eighth districts for collection tomorrow (Monday), and then exchange the vouchers for cash vouchers after payment. It will still take two or three days to extend. As for the quantity of rice, according to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, it will still be purchased with the voucher for 1.5 sheng per person. The date and price will be announced by the District Public Office. As for the 43rd period of rationed rice, today is the last day for sale. It will be invalid if it is overdue.</p>

<p>Minister of Political Affairs Zhou Fohai was invited to the first session of the second term of the New National Movement Civil Servants and Youth Corps Summer Training Camp. He personally visited the camp at 8:30 a.m. yesterday (the 14th) to give a special lecture titled "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings." He explained the Three Principles of the People in great detail. The trainees of both camps were deeply moved.</p>

<p>Since the reorganization and establishment of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate on the first of this month, all criminal cases in the city have been investigated separately in accordance with procedures. Rumors that the Procuratorate's investigation of cases has been temporarily suspended are untrue. According to the case investigation statistics released by the Procuratorate yesterday, from the 8th of this month to the 13th, a total of 235 cases were prosecuted to the local court, and 146 cases were not prosecuted. This shows that the Local Procuratorate is gradually exercising the powers of the procurator under sound conditions to protect the legal rights and interests of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Bread Prices <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The First and Third Districts issued a notice yesterday that from August 16th of this year, the following prices will be implemented in this district: White bread: The wholesale price is set at 7 yuan and 9 jiao per pound, and the retail price is set at 8 yuan and 5 jiao per pound (excluding packaging). Black bread: The wholesale price is set at 7 yuan and 1 jiao per pound, and the retail price is set at 7 yuan and 7 jiao per pound (excluding packaging). (If other weights are used, they shall be calculated according to the pound rate.) (If packaging is used, a fee of 3 jiao per pound is allowed.) Top-grade wheat bread: The retail price is 7 yuan and 6 jiao per pound with the flour coupon attached to the bread purchase certificate (excluding packaging).</p>

<p>All deaths occurring within the entire area of the Shanghai Special Municipality must be reported to the Shanghai Local Procuratorate for dispatching personnel to examine the bodies. It is learned that deaths occurring within the Eighth District (former French Concession) were all reported by the General Inspectorate for inspection. At the beginning of the takeover of the concession, the establishment of the Third Police Bureau was complicated and confusing. Therefore, the examination of corpses for the past two weeks has been handled according to the original rules. Now, starting tomorrow (the 16th), Monday, the reporting of deaths for inspection in the six districts of Xiaodongmen, Mailan, Laofei, Central, Beidang and Fuxu will be directly reported to the Shanghai Local Procuratorate for inspection, without going through the Third Police Bureau. However, the morgue is still located in the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall.</p>

<p>Chongming, Jiading, and Baoshan have implemented clearing since April of this year. From May 10th, districts have conducted population censuses at different times. They have requested the formation of Baojia and trained township chiefs and Baojia chiefs. By mid-July, all districts in Chongming and other places have submitted the results of the compilation and investigation to the Clearing Affairs Bureau one after another. After the bureau's responsible department compiled statistical tables and comparative tables, they were widely published. This is a major achievement of the clearing administration. Moreover, the number of households before the clearing in the district was more than the number after the clearing.

<h3 id="e46">Commentary: Speaking of Proper Headroom <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The new financial system of Manchukuo is: The central bank becomes the issuing bank and the agency that controls finance; the Manchukuo Industrial Development Bank is the industrial and mining financial agency that provides development funds; domestic general banks and industrial and commercial financial cooperatives are general industrial and commercial financial agencies; and the gradually established Xingnong Cooperative Bank is the agricultural financial agency. This new system enables the central bank of Manchukuo to establish close ties with the Ministry of Finance and financial institutions, taking the central bank as the center, and each advancing towards the mission it bears.</p>
<p>What is most noteworthy is the issue of the central bank reorganizing the business of general banks. The central bank of Manchukuo focuses on establishing a division of labor in the business of financial institutions, so that they can respectively undertake heavy industry finance, agricultural finance, and general industrial and commercial finance. For each business sector's financial institutions, it can provide a large number of loans to advance towards the path of national production. A loan of this nature is truly the so-called supply of the normal headroom required by the bank.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored that the Central Reserve Bank, in order to stabilize the financial situation in the city, will continue to provide support for the headroom needed by various small banks for legitimate purposes, which is of course what the financial community is most happy to hear. However, if we don't talk about proper headroom, then we can't help but believe that the integration of small banks by domestic general banks and the reorganization of the ordinary banking industry are issues worthy of our serious consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e47">After the Central Reserve Bank Regulates Headroom, Bank Rumors Cease <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>On Friday, due to the strict crackdown on speculation and the thorough investigation of hoarding by the Changju, and the tightening of financial institutions, interbank lending, and Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank, which was suspected of speculation, suddenly felt that the headroom turnover was not working, and announced a temporary suspension of receipts. For a while, people's hearts were uneasy, and rumors were rampant in the market. It was rumored that more than a dozen banks in this city, such as so-and-so, also had a problem with headroom turnover, and suffered from rumors of a temporary suspension of interbank lending. In view of this, the Central Reserve Bank decided to continue to maintain the supply of headroom needed by various small banks for legitimate purposes in order to maintain financial stability and reassure people's minds. At the same time, the Banking Federation and the Money House Reserve have also allocated huge amounts of headroom to lend to the industry to facilitate regulation. As a result, the headroom of each bank has become more flexible, and receipts and payments have not been suspended. As a result, financial rumors have disappeared. At the same time, the Central News Agency explained the misunderstanding in a letter from the cloth industry bank, and all operations are proceeding as usual.</p>
<p>Inspect Lending by Financial Institutions</p>
<p>Since the incident of Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank temporarily suspending receipts, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has sent personnel to inspect the bank's books and records. At the same time, it is also paying close attention to the disease movement of the general banking industry. The work of investigating the loan situation of banks, money houses, insurance investment companies, etc. has now been completed, and the inspection situation has been reported to the Ministry of Finance. The content is roughly that in the past, about 60% of the loans made by financial institutions were used for hoarding. The loan interest rate was mostly 3 to 4% per month. Most of the hoarded materials were wool fabrics, gas fertilizers, soaps, oils, chemical drugs, rayon, etc. It is reported that the inspection was carried out under strict planning and used a swift and lightning-fast method, so that all industries could not hide anything, so the teaching was very broad.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Strengthen Savings Bank Institutions and Strictly Limit Capital Utilization <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>In order to encourage savings, protect the interests of depositors, and strengthen the machinery of savings banks, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that savings banks that accept small deposits through welfare methods, and those that also operate savings, must collect a minimum paid-up capital of 5 million yuan. As for the capital of the savings bank, it must be at least 6 million yuan. In commercial military areas, it may be reduced with approval, but it must not be less than 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Stipulated Business</p>
<p>Savings banks may not engage in other businesses concurrently. Demand deposits that can be paid at any time, fixed deposits with lump-sum deposit and lump-sum payment, fixed deposits with lump-sum deposit and zero payment or lump-sum deposit and zero payment and periodic interest payment, custody business, collection of payments and remittances on behalf, trading and custody of marketable securities on behalf, payment of funds for public welfare organizations and cooperatives, and notification deposits for public welfare organizations and cooperatives.</p>
<p>Capital Utilization</p>
<p>Savings banks use the following funds: Purchase government bonds, treasury bills and other marketable securities with reliable guarantees approved by the Ministry of Finance; loans secured by government bonds, treasury bills and other marketable securities with reliable guarantees approved by the Ministry of Finance; loans secured by real estate that continues to have reliable income; loans secured by fixed deposit certificates or passbooks of other banks; purchase of bills accepted by other banks; deposits in other banks; pledge loans to agricultural payment cooperatives; and loans secured by agricultural products.</p>
<p>Guarantee Responsibility</p>
<p>Savings banks must deposit deposit reserve funds in the Central Reserve Bank in accordance with the regulations as a guarantee for the repayment of savings deposits. When the assets of the savings bank are insufficient to repay the debts of each depositor, the directors and supervisors shall bear joint and unlimited liability.</p>
<p>Chinese Stock Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, the general increase in the market was mostly due to the unanimous prosperity of all parties. However, it was dominated by banking capital, which inevitably affected the sentiment of buyers. Moreover, a certain type of measurement, which happened to be the end of the week, was not short of high-selling. Supply and demand were in a stalemate. The normal day showed a rise first and then the same labor, and the closing price was much higher than that of the previous day's noon, while the afternoon price was the same, and transactions were not active. The China Underwear of the department store industry rose the most sharply, fluctuating around 100 levels. Wing On Company suffered a small setback after hitting 170 levels, but the closing price still rose sharply. Sincere rose slightly, and then rose another 50 levels. Jingfu Socks continued to rise and exceeded 4 levels, and Jinglun followed suit slightly. Hongxing Socks Factory traded at 4 levels. Wing On Textile fluctuated within 170 levels.

Public Utilities Electrical Appliances were being sought after at 35. Xinyi Machinery also saw an increase. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose by several tens, and Da Zhonghua Match had already hit 4. Kangyuan Canned Food rose to 25. Biao Xue Wei Fen's price also rose. Xin Asia Construction and Jiu An Industrial stopped trading due to transfer of ownership. Xin Yi Real Estate rose sharply. Lianhua Real Estate had no sellers after ex-rights. Other stocks generally saw a sharp rise.</p>
<p>Commercial Summary</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: Gold shops in the gold and silver industry are still selling spot gold, and there are few transactions outside the industry, but the price is seeking to rise sharply. At noon, it rose to 10 levels. The price of silver per tael still stood at 9 levels.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The grey market for unified government bonds is firm. Grade B and Grade D both rose to 20 levels. Grade A and Grade E also rose to 2 levels, especially the latter. Grade C was outside 24 levels.</p>
<p>Rice: The rice market had about 1,000 bags arriving, but retail transactions were sluggish. There was also little intention to import from the local street. Merchant shipments continued to arrive, so prices continued to weaken. New japonica rice retreated to 20 levels, while late rice was outside 19 levels. Chongming Sha Huang opened slightly outside 8 levels, and there was no market for the rest.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Four Manufacturers Enthusiastically Help Students; Additional Donation of Stationery; Yan Hai Elementary School Returns Tuition Balance to Aid Needy Students, Commendable Enthusiasm <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper previously reported that Heji Educational Supplies Store, Puyye Printing House, Huazhong Factory, and Shanghai Pencil Factory donated a large batch of stationery, totaling over 120,000 yuan in value, to be distributed among the students approved by the various scholarship groups of this newspaper, in order to alleviate the burden on needy students. Their benevolence and righteous actions are truly admirable. However, as there were many student applicants in each group this year, the four manufacturers, fearing insufficient distribution, yesterday once again, Heji Educational Supplies Store additionally donated 750 A-brand erasers, 750 bottles of Xiaojin ink, 750 large and small Kaishu calligraphy brushes each, Huazhong Factory donated 750 bottles of 814 blue-black ink, and 750 148-brand pens. Puyye Printing House donated 850 Zhongdaolin practice notebooks. Shanghai Pencil Factory donated 1,500 Shanghai brand 380 pencils. Their enthusiasm for helping students is truly admirable. However, there have been slight changes to the distribution among the groups.</p>
<p>Yan Hai Elementary School Returns Remaining Funds</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from the Municipal Yan Hai Elementary School stating that the school's tuition for this semester is 125 yuan. This newspaper is subsidizing six students from the school who applied, at 200 yuan each, resulting in a surplus of 510 yuan, which is being returned to this newspaper to assist other needy students. The school's dedication to assisting with scholarship matters is greatly appreciated. It has been verified that the school's tuition amount has not yet been officially stipulated. Therefore, students attending the school did not fill in the application amount. During the review, this newspaper, based on the general tuition standards of schools, subsidized each student with 200 yuan. As the school's tuition is particularly low, 510 yuan is being returned, which will be incorporated into the scholarship donation fund.</p>
<p>Commendable to Extend Consideration to Others</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pei Deshun, a recipient of the second session of this newspaper's scholarship, wrote a letter stating, "I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship of 80 old currency from your esteemed newspaper for the spring semester of February 31st year of the Republic of China, from the middle school group (Quanzhou Middle School), which spared me the pain of dropping out of school midway. This kindness and virtue are always in my heart. Therefore, I have donated 160 yuan, saved from my usual transportation and snack expenses, to your newspaper as a small contribution to the scholarship fund, to express my gratitude." This student's extending consideration to others is truly commendable.</p>
