<h3 id="c1">法的神聖性 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>雖然臣願悉言所聞</p>
<p>「臣聞不知而言不智，知而不言不忠，為人臣不忠當死，言而不當亦當死。雖然臣願悉言所聞，啡大王裁其罪。」（韓非子：「初見秦」）</p>
<p>佛敎謂人死，乃動身赴陰間旅行之意。所以日本有一種習慣，當死人出殯時，要在棺材中放進六分銅錢去。這是給死人過陰間半道上「三途之川」時的渡船費，六分錢是陰問的法定波船費。無須多給。然而中國的陰間，虎狼般的封建勢力，仍然在盛踞着，因而陰間的途中，有好多關口。各個關口上都有陰間差員在攔阻去路，如不施以相當的賄賂，則不能保證旅途安全。所以在葬埋死人時，普通都要陪送數千元或數萬元的「冥鈔」。這樣還是不够，所以死人家族，親戚朋友等，就大燒其紙綫，借此把這筆巨款，電匯給陰間的旅客。陰間是人世國家機構的觀念模寫，只在這一點上，日本和中國間就有如許的不同，這決不是沒有理由的。在上海馬路上，類似這樣的現象，我們可以看得到不知月幾。向負米或運其他物品的小販，强要賄賂，此情此景，眞是世界文明國家，絕少看見的今古奇觀。所謂賄賂也者，是日本稱「袖之下」的別名，而普通原則是夜問背後，偷偷摸摸作的玩意兒。可是搬到上海來，則竟自在大庭廣衆間，車水馬龍前，公然為之。此種人所共睹的公開罪行，正好似露出海面的冰山，其看不見的部份，不知比能看見的部份要大多少倍。例如：在路傍屋角，擺設着小登擦鞋的小伙子。不僅義務地給一部份差員老爺們擦鞋，還必須從每天四五十元的微末收入裏，繳納應分的「捐稅」。否則，以「違反交通規章」的大罪名，加到身上，則被趕到陰山背後，永不得翻身。專以黃包車夫和三輪車夫為對象的，街頭巷尾上售賣「雲吞」和「豆腐腦」的小挑，除分文不苟地繳納規定營業稅外，還不得不以應分的數額孝敬孝敬「街頭保護者」，否則就不能受到適當的「保護」。如三輪車夫一不加小心忘記了點燈，則立刻沒收照會。但倒不必路途迢迢地跑到官廳去繳納罰款，而只要當塲遞過五塊頭的鈔票去，就保管立刻原璧奉趙。這種風氣，普遍地流行於任何一個社會角落裏，試看烟紙店一開市，則傍面定有人，按該店的大小，而月月要求三百元至五百元的保護費。烟紙店等，因店員有時利用黑市出賣一部份商品，如一一都按法規勒令停止營業，也是一件「吃不消」的事情，於是便不得不唯命是後，孝敬保護費，以求「保護」。以前，這類同樣勾當，曾由街頭流氓團體專任，但近來則被一部份號衣差員壓迫，奪去金飯盌，而竟自失業了。</p>
<p>國家維持社會道德的工具是法律，但應當執行法律的差員，如不把法律當作維持道德的工具用，反而當作破壞道德的工具用，那末這個國家的前途，就是十分危險的。又何况應當執行法律的官吏，竟為個人的私利，而使用法律呢？如是則民衆更不承認法的尊嚴了。被已成為强要賄賂工具的法所處罰，民衆反認為是件無上的光榮，這是最危險的現象。</p>
<p>我曾把這件事情講給一位高級官吏聽，他立刻回答說：「如動輒注意中國的少許賄路，那就會神經衰弱的」。我反駁這一點說：「我也許神經于技弱，但你是患有瘋優病的」。我認為，凡事實上不懂得這個現象的危險性者，全是患有瘋傻病的。法的神聖性被破壞時，即法成為掠奪民衆的工具時，則民衆就不再希望這個國家繼續存在下去，不明白這個嚴重的危險性者，縱稱之為傻瓜，也不算錯。</p>
<p>維持法的神聖性，是法官的至上天職，道是文明國家的一個常識。以前帝俄的最後一位皇帝，尙在皇太子時，曾到日本來遊幸，在京都的附近大津，曾遇暴徒襲擊而受傷。日本政府當局因國際形勢關係，為了保持和俄羅斯的友好，站在政治立塲上，分要求對這一暴徒處以死刑。誠然，對於國家元首的暗殺未遂兇犯，是可以處極刑的，但皇太子並非元首，所以不一定能够適甩這條法律。因此受理該裁判的一位法官，担絕政府的要求，以去留力爭，終於維持了法的神聖性。日本國民，一直到現在，尙未忘掉這個法官維護法的神聖性之功續。法，旣經決定為法，則主權者也不得任意遠反了，是有其神聖不可侵犯的尊嚴的。就在這裏，才有國家的永久存在性。</p>
<p>韓非子也很瞭解這一點，所以他曾說：「故明主使其羣臣不遊意於法之外，不為惠於法之內。動無非法，法所以凌過遊外私也」。又說：「法不阿貴，繩不撓袖，法之所加，智者弗能辭，勇者弗敢爭。刑過不避大臣，賞善不遺匹夫。故矯上之失，詰下之邪，治亂決繆絀羨齊非，一民之軌，莫如法」。</p>
<p>這樣法的神聖性，究竟在目前中國的什麽地方看得到呢？一部份下級差員不怕法，但這種精神決不是他們的專有品。「買官」所花費的錢，這樣得到了償還。不希望這樣的收入，而花錢運動官作的傻瓜，是沒有的吧！買官所下的資本，就在當官期間內把它牧回來，同時還須得到利息。於是，當他在職的短期內，就會濫用法律。只要能拿出錢來，縱使跳　廳的老闆，或是流氓小嘍囉，都可以搖身一變，成為管　老百姓的官吏，像這　現象，常然會鼓勵下級差員，為非作歹。有人認為下級差員的為非作歹，是由於單純靠月俸不够維持生活，以致不得已而然。然而試觀日本的憲兵和警察，從未以這種藉口，為自圓其說的根據。國家公認官吏的罪行，就是國家水身的自殺行為。</p>
<p>大家對於根本癥結所在，或者無須冉加伸說，早已瞭如指掌。問題中心，只是在於政府當局，毅然決然，實行快刀斬亂麻的手術。然而肅正綱紀的問題，如常此以往，置若罔聞，其為害之大，或尙未被一般人所充分認識。現在如不下一斷然決心，則病入膏盲，悔之晚矣。如死後再向陰間差員實行賄賂，也早已無濟於事了。（漢譯）</p>

<p>東京十一日中央社電　日重光外相十一日下午七時二十分假此間中央廣播電台發表廣播演說、其大意如次：英·美近曾舉行會談，表明其眞意在征服日本，使日本恢復明治維新並之狀態，並稱：彼等作戰目的在剷除妨害其意圖之日軍武力，直戰至使日本無條件屈服而後巳，然所謂使日本恢復維新前之狀態者，其含義何在耶，夫亞細亞洲雖</p>
<p>有數千年</p>
<p>之光輝精神文明，但因於和平與無謂聲中之貪圖安逸，遂不敵英美之武力，故彼等於過去數世紀間，由西而東，逐步侵略亞洲，阿拉伯之世界，伊斯蘭之世界、印度。緬甸、馬來，爪哇以及菲律賓等，悉成為彼等之殖民地，東亞大陸由南至北，不淪為其殖民地，印淪為其半殖民地。彼等如此侵略亞洲，榨取亞洲。以求木國之繁榮，復為征服中國，竟發動鴉片戰爭，彼等對於日本亦欲採取同　之措置。制定艦隊之縣殊比例，其目的不外為征服日本。今日英·美夢想時光倒流，使日本恢復維新前之狀態。實不可能、蓋日本自肇國以來，經一世紀之奮鬥，始克與世界各國併肩馳騁於國際舞台：隨隨世界之進展而漸次充實其內容，巳能以大國之地位，擔任</p>
<p>世界和平</p>
<p>責任。但日本以大國及亞洲先驅之資格保衛東亞，頗為英美所不悅，彼等故乃運用一切策謀，使日本不能成為强大國家，其最顯着者，為樹立使中國與日本抗爭之政策，分割支配，乃為彼等之常套手段。其在歐洲則作為均勢政策，予以實施，在中國則作為門戶開放，機會均等之政策，英美旣決意不許日本以大國之地位存在，故在政治上探取分割而支配之手段，在經濟上則以其壟斷之資源及有組織之經濟力為武器，進行經濟戰爭，故大東亞戰爭實在珍珠港灣戰以前，已由彼等發動。大東亞戰爭二年以來，日軍巳將侵略勢力驅出東亞，侵略勢力在過去殘存東亞之時，東亞因此朱能復固其自然姿態，但侵略勢力被逐後，東亞自然姿態巳告恢復，而一新其面目，其自然態勢巳由日本對華政策及</p>
<p>東亞政策</p>
<p>之實現表明，此已由大東亞宣言予以昭示。英美今於目覩日本建設東亞，解放亞洲，負起保衛東亞之責任之餘，竟公然表明否認日本大國之存在，而暴　其夙欲征服日本之陰謀，彼等竟　時代之進展，表明欲使日本恢復維新前之狀况。此次開羅會談使渝方參加，幷以甘言誘引防止其離反，對渝方作種種諾言，期使中日兩國相互鬥爭，彼等竟以不可能之事實為其利益着想，而騙使渝方參加對日戰爭者，雖係深恐日本之强大，世已充分露出其野心。英美征服日本之意圖，僅能不斷以語言威脅而已，彼等之意圖，實欲以一處戰爭誘致數處戰爭，對於世界和平並無任何建設之表示，僅暴露欲征服亞洲及支配世界之對心而巳。此與大東亞宣言相較，其主張之正邪，至為明暸，一　　係建設的</p>
<p>而另一則爲破壞的，此乃實為人類史上之極好對照，當此全亞洲民族獲得光明自主獨立之機運與起之際，英美此種無智下策，自不能奏效。日本現正與同盟各國同心協力為解放及保衛建設東亞而睹其國運，軍戰奮鬥中，東亞係東亞人之鄉土，此戰爭則為保衛鄉土之戰爭，束亞之能否掙脫英美之桎梏，或重淪為英美之殖民地，永遠呻吟於其壓迫下，全賴於此次戰爭，故此次戰爭既為日本興廢之戰爭，同時亦為東亞獨立之戰爭，不僅為解放亞洲之戰爭，且為發揚世界正義之大戰爭。日·德兩國為摧毀英美支配世界之野心，以奠定公正之永久和平　今在東西兩方</p>
<p>善謀勇戰</p>
<p>獲舉光　之戰果，敵方顯呈焦慮之色，日·德兩國如能與同盟諸國貫澈必勝之信念，作戰到底，則最後勝利，必屬於我者，明若觀火。</p>

<p>九日最高國防會議通過「戰時公務員宴會及送禮限制暫行條例」。綜觀內容，對於公務員「宴會」及「送禮」的限制辦法，　有具體的規定。該條例第一條即提示「為滴應戰時體制，儲存物資，增進國力，並厲行節約」。誠然，這條例的制定，完全針對戰時需要的。</p>
<p>我們曾在本年四月間倡導「節省宴會公約」，提出節約辦法，徵集各界意見，一時響應紛紛，同時，對於公務人員尤應威少宴會，也曾一再論列。而政府這次以功令約來所屬人員之宴會與送禮，一定比較我們輿論的力量更為有效。我們為戰時物資節約着想，誠不勝期待之至。</p>
<p>政府在戰時所頃布的法令巳經不少，每種法令都有其客觀與主觀上的重要性，而這次的限制宴會送禮條例，在性質上言，似乎事關微末，然而就意義上言，我們認為超過一般法令之上，而尤為未經前見的良法，這是値得人民所稱道的。</p>
<p>不過，徒法不能自行，既經制定，尤貴認眞執行。我們不希望也不願見公務員之因遠反本條例而受處分的事實。我們却希望公務員們注意與認眞實行本條例的規定，絕對遵守，絕不違犯。因為本條例的對象，只是公務員，所以，本條例公布以後的反響如何？就可以證明我國公務員的守法程度如何？寄語公務人員，幸各勉之！</p>

<p>自大東亞戰爭勃發迄今，囘顧經濟施策的抵移，不禁有幾多的感想，就其大者而言，共一為中國經濟統一化的傾向，共二為中國經濟運營的傾向，關於第一點，自去年以儲備券為統一通貨後，到今年四月，又有停止發行軍票的　規定，直至最近在蘇淮地區開始流通儲備券，更見有飛　的進步，把以前無責任的市塲流言，給予一個有力的證明，今後將由通貨而促進中國統一，則經濟力量的發揮，當更，效果，此外如設置全國經濟義員會，關於財政經濟以及　府政令，將漸次擴大適用地區，而有歷史性的全國商業統制總會之設立，更為重耍，為中國經濟統一之目標，雖目前有種種困難，但不必因此悲觀，而可徐圖改進的。</p>
<p>關於中國經濟運營的傾向·可　而舉者，如各地敵產的　渡。治外法權的撤廢，租界的歸還，以及國策公司的調整等等·都與財政經濟有很大的意義，中國是農業國，也是大東亞共榮團之一環，當就最大可能，增强農產物的生產，以盡共榮圈建設之責任，中國經濟界，應當從這點去努力，同時農村與都市的物資交流，也應該使之圓滑推進，</p>
<p>對於過去三年來的經濟情勢發展，僅扼要的舉出二項傾向、或許要招致非難，但我們對於此項傾向，深信應當助長發展，也是今後中國經濟應走的途徑，實有强化的必要，自新政策開始迄今的時日雖不短，但其成果亦不少，於此我們自當再反省檢討，以貫澈新政策的眞精神，（節譯十二月十日大陸新報」</p>

<p>鴻英圖書舘主辦的二西書　金石展覽會今天閉　了，不侒在迫隨沈僧卿蔣竹莊兩先生之後三四月來主持道一件工作、承海內賢邊及諸大名家不棄。各以珍品捐惠，謹在此先表示敬意！而夏劍永葉玉甫陳陶遺陳彬龢潘　　　定之唐快塵養　馬公愚汪亞　梅畹華申石珈丁寇顏楊達邦諸先生。吳靑霞罷左玉周鍊霞周叔惲諸女十熱忱贊助、尤為公感！</p>
<p>此次參加之名作家近二百人，出品四百點、均經專家審愼精選精裝，（以時間關係，亦有少數不及付裝者），可謂件件名責，不易多得，展會定期一週。承中國畫苑陳定山王不遷徐邦達諸子業於會塲租借破例優待，熱心　助義舉。尤應特申謝意！</p>
<p>圖書館是一種輔助敎育的社會文化事業，在我國的圖書館發展史，還不上百年，鴻英關書館的前身是人文圖書館，是甲子社，性質稍偏得於現代歷史經濟，當初由沈信卿黃伯雨馬雋卿張一　張君邁等諸先生秉服務人羣之旨而發起，當時的經費來源，都出於熱心於此事業老，如周靜　錢新之　藕初胡筆江王儒黨周作民張公權劉鴻生嚴裕棠等諸先生的維護，或任常年經費，或臨時捐助。到了民國廿二年，商界巨子葉鴻英先生來館參觀，深為許可，慨助基金，遂改今名。自此館中經濟狀況，可稱安定。其間最値得感謝的是各著作家藏書家各機關出版　的不斷予以援助，迨事變後，基金减折，大部份工作停頓，且又陷於雖以維持的境况，蓋到目下為止，館中藏書巳達十五萬餘册，各類索引卡三十十三萬片，史料　輯一百八十餘萬片。每餓閱覽人數平均在千人以上，大都爲工商學術界人士，鴻英迄已爲海上有數的圖書館，而維持爲艱，尙有待於社會扶助。</p>
<p>圖書館是「朝長夜大」的，辦理既需專門人才，支持館務尤需相當麗大之財力，私立圖書館在這一點，每很感困難，鴻英目下按月一切的支出僅萬金，但全年經費所可動用的基息與收入總共只有二乭餘元，每年不敷就有九萬十萬之巨，如果再從人事工作加以恢復調整的話，每月支出約需三萬元，那就照目下支出要增三倍之多，歷年來沈蔣兩老的緊苦卓絕精神，自必爲社會所驚歎，而來日大難，如何維護此社會文化事業，正是我人所日夜焦慮的。今年夏間，沈館長年屆八十，社會人士以先生二十年心力惟在鴻英，請移壽儀充館經費而始稱壽，初不是沈先生的本意，但我人自極感謝社會人士之熱忱維護，此次二西展會全部舊款，仍完全充經費，以海上人士之多熱心社會事業和愛好藝術，我也相信二酉展會之盛况，將為歷來所僅見。</p>

<p>這裏我們必須將眞人的出生地。下荒田的鄉土誌，介紹一下。</p>
<p>荒田的名字，據說是出於七百年前薩摩圖田帳中，可想而知是一個很古的地方。不過，僅僅是一個城下邊陬的地方，只有漁戶，農戶，或食微祿的武士的門庭，在各處散在着。</p>
<p>但也有例外，如川上，喜入等名門的公館，就在此地，此外都是些不足掛齒的陋室。</p>
<p>明治維新後，當地也並沒有什麼發展。據大正六年的戶口調查，僅有六百餘戶。近來因為發掘溫泉，才繁華起來，增到三倍了。</p>
<p>像這樣邊僻的地方，在明治時代，却出了赫赫的名人。如松方正義，川村景明元帥等。</p>
<p>從來，應兒島的名士，以西鄕隆盛為首，嚴出於城下的所謂「下」地方的寒門，下荒田也是其中的一部。松方家的貧困，是最著名的，他的賢母袈裟子常說，常時連蕃　的稀粥，也不常容易到口的。</p>
<p>像這樣的海邊　會，貧因的村落，但是，在這海中取的魚，叫做荒田魚，却以鮮美著稱的。這海濱被利用作薩摩藩的鹽田，與次郞海濱的名字，由於農民車田與次耶，獻身開發鹽田事業而起的。</p>
<p>下能田的海岸，在日本所以有歷史的重要意義，首先要推御船手址，和其他的史蹟。所謂御船手，就是舊藩時代的海軍工廠，有海兵團，以船渠為中心，船長，水手，造船工匠等，俱都過着集團的生活。在幕府未年採用蒸氣式軍艦時代，船員仍然任用御船手組的人們。當我們想起日本海軍，和薩摩水軍的關係的時候，這附近是忘却不了的地方。</p>
<p>再談關於軍事方面，火繩槍和洋式槍的競射，八十磅砲的試射，都是在這海岸舉行的。尤其是島津齊彬，斷然採用法國式的陸軍訓練，敎養了三千精兵，其地點也就在這海岸上。他決意率領這一支精兵，爲控制幕府的專橫而東上，在安政五年七月，炎暑之下，正在親自指揮演習時因發病而薨去了。</p>
<p>被數株老松圍住了的舊營址，到現在仍要使薩摩人　弔而淚下的。</p>
<p>更引起我們囘憶而不能忘却的史實，就是在這裏首創的砲臺。文久三年、淮濱之役，向英國軍艦放了最可記念的第一砲，這砲臺的遣跡，被風吹雨打，現在已經成為一塊砥石似的，在天保公園中殘留着。（五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Holiness of Law <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Although I, your servant, wish to fully express what I have heard,</p>
<p>"I have heard that to speak without knowing is unwise, and to not speak knowing is disloyal. A subject who is disloyal should die, and to speak improperly should also die. Although I, your servant, wish to fully express what I have heard, may the great king judge my crime." (Han Feizi: "First Meeting with Qin")</p>
<p>Buddhism states that when a person dies, they travel to the underworld. Therefore, there is a Japanese custom of putting six copper coins in the coffin when a person is buried. This is the fare for the ferry across the "Sanzu River" on the way to the underworld. Six coins is the legally required ferry fare in the underworld. No need to give more. However, in the Chinese underworld, feudal forces like tigers and wolves still prevail, so there are many checkpoints along the way. Each checkpoint has underworld officers blocking the way, and unless a substantial bribe is given, the safety of the journey cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, when burying the dead, it is common to include thousands or tens of thousands of yuan in "hell money." Even this is not enough, so the deceased's family, relatives, and friends burn paper money in large quantities, using this method to telegraph this huge sum to the traveler in the underworld. The underworld is a replica of human state institutions. In this respect alone, Japan and China differ so greatly, and this is not without reason. On the streets of Shanghai, we can see similar phenomena countless times each month. Forcing bribes from vendors carrying rice or other goods is a truly rare spectacle in the world of civilized nations. The so-called bribe is another name for what Japan calls "under the sleeve," and the general rule is that it is done secretly behind one's back at night. But when it is moved to Shanghai, it is done openly in public, in front of bustling traffic. This kind of public crime, seen by all, is like an iceberg with only a tip visible above the water, and the invisible part is many times larger than the visible part. For example, the young men who set up small stools on the roadside corners to shine shoes must not only shine shoes for some of the officers for free, but also pay their share of "taxes" from their meager daily income of forty or fifty yuan. Otherwise, they will be charged with the serious crime of "violating traffic regulations" and driven behind the Yin Mountain, never to recover. Small peddlers selling "wonton" and "tofu brains" in the streets and alleys, who target rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers, must not only pay the prescribed business tax without missing a penny, but also respectfully give their due amount to the "street protectors," otherwise they will not receive adequate "protection." If a pedicab driver is not careful and forgets to turn on the lights, the permit is immediately confiscated. But there is no need to travel all the way to the official office to pay the fine; simply hand over a five-yuan bill on the spot, and it will be immediately returned intact. This atmosphere prevails in every corner of society. Just look at a cigarette shop opening for business, and there is definitely someone nearby who will demand a protection fee of three hundred to five hundred yuan per month, depending on the size of the shop. Cigarette shops, etc., sometimes use the black market to sell some of their goods. If they were all ordered to close down according to regulations, it would be too much to bear, so they have no choice but to obey orders and pay protection money in order to seek "protection." In the past, these kinds of shady dealings were exclusively handled by street gangster groups, but recently, some uniformed officers have pressured them, snatched their golden rice bowl, and become unemployed themselves.</p>
<p>The state's tool for maintaining social morality is the law, but if the officers who are supposed to enforce the law do not use the law as a tool to maintain morality, but instead use it as a tool to undermine morality, then the future of this country is very dangerous. Moreover, what if the officials who are supposed to enforce the law use the law for their personal gain? If this is the case, then the people will no longer recognize the dignity of the law. To be punished by a law that has become a tool for demanding bribes is considered a supreme honor by the people, and this is the most dangerous phenomenon.</p>
<p>I once told this matter to a high-ranking official, and he immediately replied, "If you pay attention to China's small bribes, you will become neurotic." I retorted, "I may be neurotic, but you are suffering from dementia." I believe that all those who do not understand the danger of this phenomenon are suffering from dementia. When the sanctity of the law is destroyed, when the law becomes a tool for plundering the people, then the people no longer hope that this country will continue to exist. Those who do not understand this serious danger are rightly called fools.</p>
<p>Maintaining the sanctity of the law is the supreme duty of judges, a common sense in civilized countries. In the past, the last emperor of Imperial Russia, when he was still the crown prince, came to Japan for a visit. Near Otsu in Kyoto, he was attacked and injured by a rioter. The Japanese government, due to international relations, wanted to maintain friendship with Russia and, from a political standpoint, requested that this rioter be sentenced to death. Certainly, an attempted assassin of a head of state can be sentenced to the most severe punishment, but the crown prince was not the head of state, so it was not necessarily possible to apply this law. Therefore, the judge in charge of the trial refused the government's request, fought to the end, and finally maintained the sanctity of the law. The Japanese people have not forgotten this judge's merit in defending the sanctity of the law to this day. Once a law has been decided as law, even the sovereign cannot arbitrarily violate it; it has its sacred and inviolable dignity. It is here that the permanence of the state lies.</p>
<p>Han Feizi also understood this point, so he said, "Therefore, a wise ruler does not allow his ministers to stray outside the law, nor does he show favor within the law. All actions are according to law, and the law is used to restrain external private interests." He also said, "The law does not favor the noble, and the string does not bend for the sleeve. What the law applies to, the wise cannot evade, and the brave dare not contend. Punishing transgressions does not spare high officials, and rewarding good deeds does not neglect ordinary people. Therefore, correcting the mistakes of superiors, exposing the evils of subordinates, resolving disorder and confusion, eliminating excess and aligning the non-aligned, unifying the people's path, nothing is better than the law."</p>
<p>So where can the sanctity of the law be seen in China today? Some lower-level officers do not fear the law, but this spirit is by no means their exclusive possession. The money spent on "buying office" has been repaid in this way. There are no fools who spend money to run for office without hoping for such income! The capital invested in buying office is recouped during one's term, and interest must also be earned. Therefore, during his short tenure, he will abuse the law. As long as one can produce money, even the owner of a dance hall or a gangster can transform himself into an official in charge of the people. Such phenomena naturally encourage lower-level officers to commit wrongdoing. Some believe that the wrongdoing of lower-level officers is due to the fact that their monthly salaries are simply not enough to maintain their livelihoods, so they have no choice but to do so. However, look at the military police and police in Japan, who have never used this excuse as a basis for self-justification. A state recognizing the crimes of its officials is tantamount to suicide.</p>
<p>Everyone may already be fully aware of the root cause, without needing further explanation. The central problem lies in the government resolutely and decisively performing the operation of cutting the Gordian knot with a sharp knife. However, the problem of rectifying discipline, if ignored as always, is harmful to a degree that may not be fully recognized by the general public. If a decisive decision is not made now, the disease will penetrate the bone marrow, and it will be too late to regret it. If one tries to bribe underworld officers after death, it will be of no use.

<h3 id="e3">To Destroy Anglo-American Domination and Lay the Foundation for Lasting Peace: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Broadcast Address Last Night <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu gave a broadcast address from the Central Radio Station here at 7:20 PM on the 11th. The gist of his speech is as follows: England and America recently held talks, indicating their true intention is to conquer Japan, restore Japan to the state before the Meiji Restoration and claiming that their war aim is to eliminate the military force of Japan which hinders their intention, fighting until Japan surrenders unconditionally. What does it mean to restore Japan to the state before the Restoration? Asia has thousands of years</p>
<p>of glorious spiritual civilization, but due to the pursuit of peace and ease in the name of peace and futility, it is no match for the military force of England and America. Therefore, in the past few centuries, from west to east, they have gradually invaded Asia. The Arab world, the Islamic world, India, Burma, Malaya, Java, and the Philippines have all become their colonies. The East Asian continent, from south to north, has not become their colony, and India has become their semi-colony. They have invaded Asia and exploited Asia to seek the prosperity of their country. In order to conquer China, they launched the Opium War. They also wanted to take the same</p>
<p>measures against Japan. The purpose of setting the special ratio of naval fleets was none other than to conquer Japan. Today, England and America dream of turning back time, restoring Japan to the state before the Restoration. It is impossible because, since its founding, Japan has striven for a century to compete with the countries of the world on the international stage. It has gradually enriched its content with the progress of the world, and it has been able to undertake the</p>
<p>responsibility for world peace</p>
<p>in the status of a great power. However, Japan's protection of East Asia in the capacity of a great power and a pioneer in Asia is not pleasing to England and America. Therefore, they use all kinds of strategies to prevent Japan from becoming a powerful country. The most obvious is the establishment of a policy to make China and Japan fight against each other. Divide and rule is their common means. In Europe, they use it as a balance of power policy, and in China, they use it as a policy of open door and equal opportunity. England and America have decided not to allow Japan to exist as a great power, so they adopt the means of division and control in politics, and use their monopolistic resources and organized economic power as weapons to carry out economic warfare. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War was actually launched by them before the Pearl Harbor war. For two years since the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has driven the invading forces out of East Asia. When the invading forces remained in East Asia in the past, East Asia therefore could not restore its natural state. But after the invading forces were driven out, East Asia's natural state has been restored, and it has renewed its face. Its natural trend has been shown by Japan's policy towards China and</p>
<p>East Asia policy.</p>
<p>This has been shown in the Greater East Asia Declaration. England and America now, after witnessing Japan building East Asia, liberating Asia, and shouldering the responsibility of defending East Asia, openly express denial of the existence of a great Japan and revealing their long-standing conspiracy to conquer Japan, they defied the advance of the times and declared their desire to restore Japan to the state before the Restoration. The Cairo Conference lured the Chongqing side to participate and used sweet words to prevent it from defecting, making various promises to the Chongqing side, hoping to make China and Japan fight each other. They are using impossible facts for their own benefit and deceiving the Chongqing side to participate in the war against Japan. Although they are deeply afraid of the strength of Japan, the world has fully exposed their ambition. England and America's intention to conquer Japan can only be constantly threatened by language. Their intention is to induce several wars with one war, and they have not made any constructive expression for world peace, only exposing their desire to conquer Asia and dominate the world. Compared with the Greater East Asia Declaration, the right and wrong of their claims is very clear, one is</p>
<p>constructive</p>
<p>and the other is destructive. This is a very good contrast in human history. When all Asian nations gain the opportunity to be bright, autonomous, and independent, such an unwise strategy of England and America will naturally not succeed. Japan is now working with its allied countries to liberate and defend the construction of East Asia. In the midst of the military battle, East Asia is the homeland of the East Asians, and this war is a war to defend the homeland. Whether East Asia can break away from the shackles of England and America, or relapse into a colony of England and America, forever groaning under their oppression, all depends on this war. Therefore, this war is not only a war for the rise and fall of Japan, but also a war for the independence of East Asia, not only a war for the liberation of Asia, but also a great war for the promotion of world justice. Japan and Germany are working to destroy the ambition of England and America to dominate the world, in order to lay the foundation for a just and lasting peace. Now in the east and west,</p>
<p>strategizing and fighting bravely</p>
<p>achieved glorious war results, and the enemy is showing anxiety. If Japan and Germany can adhere to the belief that they will win with their allied countries and fight to the end, then the final victory must belong to us, which is as clear as watching fire.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Enemy's Decision on Comprehensive War: Party Affairs Conference Concludes Yesterday; Chairman Wang Declares Future Work Guidelines <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to meet the needs of the comprehensive decisive battle, the Chinese Nationalist Party has launched a pivotal work, gathering the masses, consolidating the foundation, reforming party affairs, and strengthening activities to promote the development of party affairs. A national party affairs work conference was convened on the 10th and 11th. The content of the meeting was: The chairman declared the future work guidelines. The central ministries presented future work plans. The meeting listened to on-the-spot reports from local party headquarters and opinions on reforming party affairs. The results of the meeting are of great importance to the promotion of current political party affairs work. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the basic policy on party-government relations, at the first general meeting on the morning of the 10th, Chairman Wang personally presided over the meeting and gave earnest instructions that party headquarters at all levels should do their utmost to correct the accumulated malpractices of "party officialization" and "party-government opposition" as a dual government before the incident. Party affairs work and political work should be closely linked to mobilize the strength of the party to assist the government in implementing policies. Regarding the basic policy on party activities, at the second general meeting on the afternoon of the 11th, the chairman encouraged all comrades at the conclusion of the meeting to deeply recognize that the fundamental foundation of the party lies in the people, the scope of party activities is in the people, and the object of party work is also in the people. Every party member must go deep into the masses and do the work of promotion. The first step is to grasp the hearts of the people so that the people believe in the party's ideology and national policy. The second step is to recruit talents so that the outstanding elements in the people can be concentrated to promote together. Regarding future work plans, on the afternoon of the 10th and the morning of the 11th, the organization department, propaganda department, and social department successively convened discussions. In addition to discussing various opinions on reforming party affairs, the most important was to carefully study the motions submitted by the three departments. On the afternoon of the 11th, it was submitted to the general meeting for discussion, revised and passed separately, and ordered to be implemented by the Central Standing Committee. The main points of each case are as follows: The work policy for the organization of party headquarters at all levels in the 33rd year includes six items: strengthening the organization of party headquarters at all levels, enriching the quality of party members, determining the central work, implementing the inspection system, implementing the evaluation method, and expanding the scope of the party's organizational activities. In addition to the regular training of general party members, the training work policy for the 33rd year also decided to hold central party affairs training groups in stages. Mobilizing all party members to promote the second phase of the New National Movement implementation plan, the policy is to mobilize all party members to participate in the promotion of all aspects of the New National Movement. Obey the three major policies of "correcting thinking," "ensuring social order," and "increasing production" instructed by the leader. In addition to intensifying ideological warfare with reasoned propaganda, we should establish "wartime life," "participating in production and increasing labor," and "cooperating in strengthening social order" as the focus of practical work. Party members should go deep into the youth groups and take the lead in advocating "going to the countryside" to establish the foundation of rural national organizations. Ensure the connection between urban youth and rural youth, and launch the great work of material construction of the New National Movement. Based on the basic outline of wartime cultural propaganda policy, prepare the wartime cultural institutions and launch the cultural movement of the new era. In order to promote work to restore effectiveness, it is proposed to implement the "Wartime Social Undertaking Center Work Outline" reform implementation plan within a limited time. According to this meeting, the emphasis is on the substantive discussion of reforming party affairs. In addition to the meeting rules and respectful reading of the Prime Minister's will, all ceremonies were completely deleted and all social activities were completely stopped. The chairman's banquet on the evening of the 11th was also in the form of a simplest meal, and the spirit of the meeting was more enthusiastic than before, and the results of the meeting were also very satisfactory. The pivotal development of party affairs in the future can be foreseen.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a Japanese military base dispatch, Japanese army air units have been continuously thwarting attempts by the US Air Force to stir up trouble on the mainland front lines. They are also relentlessly bombing enemy bases whenever and wherever possible, inflicting heavy damage. Since (the 10th), Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed Hengyang in Hunan Province, a forward base for the US Air Force, completely destroying the enemy airfield's military facilities. Another team of Japanese planes has repeatedly bombed Shaoguan in Guangdong Province, Wuzhou in Guangxi Province, Li County in Hunan Province, and He County, about 100 kilometers southeast of Guilin, in the southwest region since the 7th, inflicting heavy damage on enemy airfields and completely crushing the enemy's attempt to actively stir up trouble starting from the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The record of the Japanese planes' activities is as follows: On the morning of the 7th, at 11:00 AM, Wuzhou was bombed, destroying the airfield and military facilities, with fires breaking out in several places.

Enemy planes, having suffered heavy damage from continuous Japanese air raids, fled to various locations, making it impossible to track their whereabouts. The airfields in the southwest of Chongqing have suffered extremely heavy damage after being fiercely bombed by Japanese planes. The Japanese side lost one aircraft.</p>

Currently, the Commerce and Trade Commission is verifying the payment prices based on the then-specified standard prices of 10,000 yuan for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn and 375 yuan for Dragon Head fine cloth. Several hundred cases have already been verified and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan is currently deliberating carefully. Once the Executive Yuan formally approves, payments will begin for the verified portion. The payment method will also be based on the original regulations: half in cash and half in bidding bonds. Half will be paid three months after the date of purchase, and the other half will be paid after one year. The remaining half of the payment will be paid in reserve certificates, one-sixth every six months from the date of purchase, with the remaining amount paid in full after two years. Therefore, according to these regulations, December 7th is the date for the first payment. However, because there are many categories, it will take time to verify the prices. More than one-third has not yet been verified, so if payment is to be made after all verifications are completed, it will be at least January or February of next year. It is understood that the relevant authorities have now decided to first issue payments for the parts that have been verified. The dates of payment and other related matters will be officially announced in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e18">A Word to Civil Servants <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council passed the "Temporary Regulations on Wartime Civil Servant Banquets and Gift Giving" on the 9th. Looking at the contents, there are concrete regulations regarding the restrictions on civil servants' "banquets" and "gift giving." The first article of the regulations points out that they are "to adapt to the wartime system, conserve resources, enhance national strength, and promote frugality." Indeed, the formulation of these regulations is entirely aimed at wartime needs.</p>
<p>We advocated the "Frugal Banquet Covenant" in April of this year, proposed methods of frugality, and solicited opinions from all sectors. The response was overwhelming. At the same time, we repeatedly discussed that civil servants should reduce banquets. This time, the government's use of decrees to restrict the banquets and gift-giving of its personnel will certainly be more effective than the power of our public opinion. We are sincerely looking forward to the frugality of wartime materials.</p>
<p>The government has promulgated many laws and regulations during wartime. Each law has its objective and subjective importance. However, this regulation on limiting banquets and gifts seems to be a trivial matter in nature, but in terms of significance, we believe it surpasses general laws and is a good law that has never been seen before. This is something that the people should praise.</p>
<p>However, laws cannot be enforced by themselves. Once formulated, it is important to implement them seriously. We do not hope nor want to see civil servants punished for violating these regulations. We hope that civil servants will pay attention to and earnestly implement the provisions of these regulations, abide by them absolutely, and never violate them. Because the target of these regulations is only civil servants, what will be the response after the promulgation of these regulations? This can prove the extent to which our country's civil servants abide by the law. A word to civil servants: may you all strive for it!</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e32">Review and Outlook of Economic Policies <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Looking back at the changes in economic policies since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, one cannot help but have many feelings. In general, there are two major trends: one is the tendency towards the unification of the Chinese economy, and the other is the tendency towards the management of the Chinese economy. Regarding the first point, since the Reserve Bank of China notes were used as unified currency last year, and then in April of this year, there were regulations to stop issuing military scrip, and most recently, the Reserve Bank of China notes began to circulate in the Su-Huai area, showing even more flying progress. This has given a powerful proof to the previously irresponsible market rumors. In the future, unification of China will be promoted through currency, and the exertion of economic power will be more effective. In addition, the establishment of the National Economic Council will gradually expand the application of fiscal and economic policies and government decrees to more regions. The establishment of the historically significant National Chamber of Commerce is even more important. Although there are currently various difficulties in achieving the goal of unifying the Chinese economy, there is no need to be pessimistic and improvements can be made gradually.</p>
<p>Regarding the trend of China's economic operation, noteworthy examples include the transfer of enemy property in various places, the abolition of extraterritoriality, the return of concessions, and the adjustment of national policy companies, all of which have great significance for finance and the economy. China is an agricultural country and a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It should increase the production of agricultural products as much as possible to fulfill its responsibility for the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Chinese economic community should strive towards this goal. At the same time, the exchange of goods between rural and urban areas should also be promoted smoothly.</p>
<p>Highlighting only two trends in the economic situation over the past three years may invite criticism, but we firmly believe that these trends should be promoted and developed, and are also the path that the Chinese economy should take in the future, and there is a real need to strengthen them. Although the time since the new policies began is not short, there are many results. Here, we should reflect and review again to implement the true spirit of the new policies. (Abridged translation of "Continental New Report" of December 10)</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange Will Establish an Arbitration Committee to Judge Disputes and Prevent Manipulation</p>
<p>In order to prevent speculation and manipulation of Chinese stocks, the Chinese Securities Exchange, in addition to strictly enforcing the business rules, stipulates that when prices fluctuate excessively, it may suspend part or all of the trading. The standard for fluctuations will be announced by the exchange when necessary. The term for spot transactions is in principle the next day. At the same time, brokers are prohibited from engaging in unsound transactions, arbitrarily increasing or decreasing commission fees, concealing transactions, reporting more or less than the actual amount, attempting to gain advantages through trickery, and spreading false rumors. Brokers are also prohibited from engaging in fraudulent transactions. Regarding disputes between brokers and brokers, or between brokers and clients, when the parties involved request arbitration on the condition that they will not prosecute, the exchange will temporarily appoint three or more arbitrators from among its staff and brokers to form an arbitration committee to review and judge the matter. After the judgment, neither party may raise further objections. The chairman of the arbitration committee is the chairman of the board of directors. Arbitrators who have interests related to the matter, themselves, or their relatives may not perform their duties. The arbitration fee is determined at the time of the arbitration decision.</p>
<p>Market Summary</p>
<p>Public Debt The market price rose slightly again yesterday, but only for Class C, as short covering caused a rebound. For other classes, there were only asking prices, and no transactions.

There were still asking prices for Classes A and E, but Classes B and D were completely ignored.</p>

<h3 id="e34">After Several Days of Rising, Chinese Stocks Begin to Retrace <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were only open for half a day due to Saturday. The situation was mostly declining in the hesitation, which was a small retracement that should have occurred after a sharp rise. Some profits were taken out, but foreign firms and Shanghai Zhuang were still secretly buying. The demand and supply forces were equal. On that day, the trend went from virtual to tense, and after 11 o'clock, it restablized, and only after the lunch closing did it feel stable. "Department Store" dominated, Yong'an was flat, and Guohua and Guanghua both rose, probably due to rumors of capital increase. "Textile" Guanghua also rose due to the news of capital increase and Rongfeng's full subscription, Yong'an Yarn Factory, Zhongfang, Meiya and other companies were all inferior. "Xinya" was also flat and weak. In "Chemical Industry", Dachina Matches once reached 600 yuan, but later declined. In "Finance", the shouting was low. In "Public Utilities", Zhabei Water and Electricity was 340 yuan, and Huashang Electricity was 240 yuan, both slightly recovered. In "Real Estate", the fluctuations were narrow. In "Culture", the changes were also slight. Kangyuan Food was small, and Global Enterprise rose by one yuan alone. Jiu'an and other industries, as well as Guohua and China Investment, both fell slightly. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>— Zhang Yunbo</p>
<p>Alas! Is my brother truly dead? On October 27th, at the desk in the Zhongbao News Agency, a press release from the news agency suddenly caught my eye, stating that Mr. Zhang Yijun, a senator, had passed away from illness in Chongqing on the 25th. My hands trembled and my heart palpitated, and I fainted and couldn't stand up several times. Then, I thought, in the winter of 1937, my brother traveled back and forth between Ji and Mu, and in 1938, when my brother went from Ning to Han, and then to Changsha, there were rumors in the local letters and newspapers, which were soon proven untrue. So, using the past as an example, perhaps it is not yet possible to believe it? Therefore, my nephew Fu Wu Bian entrusted acquaintances to find out. For a month, the news from various sources was combined: the doctor who specialized in the treatment, the friends who paid for medical music, and the location of the Qingxishui Sanatorium, changing the month and day to 3:00 PM on October 24th. My sister-in-law, my second nephew, and my two daughters all personally witnessed the burial. Although there is still no direct family report, the descriptions are so detailed. Alas! Is my brother truly dead? My brother was seventy-seven years old this year, which cannot be said to be short-lived. However, in his life, there were many opportunities to die; but he did not die! When my mother was alive, she often told stories to her grandchildren, saying that when Mao Sheng (my brother's childhood name) was six years old, he was playing alone and fell into the goldfish tank. When he was discovered and rescued, his breath was barely there, and it was almost too late to save him. After my father passed away, my brother bore the burden of the family's life on his shoulders. He taught students and took examinations at the academy all day long, earning money to support his elderly mother and raise his younger siblings. He exhausted his energy and spirit, and it was difficult to continue for a long time. He had no choice but to go to Hubei to assist his teacher in the yamen. He suddenly went crazy and became unconscious. His teacher sent a servant to drag him onto a ship and go east along the river. Fortunately, he was rescued from drowning and only returned to Suzhou, where he lingered for two months before recovering. At that time, the Qing government discussed implementing a special economic examination. My brother was recommended by the Suzhou governor and Shaanxi Academy to take the examination and was ranked second. He was assigned as a magistrate to Hubei. Yuan Gong, the Minister of Beiyang and Governor of Zhili, transferred him to Yi Xiaoyao and appointed him to be in charge of official documents, and he was highly trusted. Later, Yuan advocated constitutionalism and changed the retirement system. He did everything he was asked to do. In the Xin Hai Year, the revolution rose, and he was elected president. My brother was in charge of confidential matters, and he relied on him like his right and left hands. However, when the Anhui Society arose, Yuan's close friends tried to please him by advocating the restoration of the monarchy. My brother was the only one who insisted that the imperial system could not be restored and that the republic could not be betrayed. He pestered him day and night. He had already called himself Shao Kai, but his son and his advisors regarded him as a great obstacle and secretly planned to put him to death. Xu Shichang and Yang Shiqi calmly told Yuan that Zhang Shushi did not violate the times and should be released in order to protect him. So, he was appointed Minister of Education and was spared from danger. After Yuan died, the constitutional government died prematurely. My brother lived in Tianjin in humble clothes. The Suzhou governor Zhao Guozhang brought him into the yamen to be in charge of the secretariat. Feng Jizong succeeded to the presidency and followed him into Beijing. He was unable to achieve his ambitions, so he resigned from his official career and lived in Suzhou. The people of Suzhou supported him and elected him as a provincial councilor. For all local reforms, he spoke frankly and directly. Officials and gentry who were inconvenienced by his actions often used other matters to hinder him, but he did not care. Yesterday, the warlords gradually became rampant. Suzhou, Qi, Zhejiang, and Lu fought each other. My brother strongly urged reconciliation, but he was not accepted. In the end, soldiers fought each other. The Suzhou army was defeated and continued to collapse. 20,000 to 30,000 defeated soldiers poured into Suzhou, which was in imminent danger. My brother went alone to the suburbs of the city and to Qi and his subordinates. Because of the shortage of food, there was no way to respond to the huge amount. It was about to collapse. Earlier, my brother told me that if things were urgent and other preparations could be delayed, you should go to Shanghai to gather your colleagues to borrow. By this time, 200,000 in cash had just been remitted to Suzhou, and my brother used it all to distribute it to the army. The danger in Suzhou was restored to safety because of this. Afterwards, the situation became more and more disturbed. The National Revolutionary Army raised the banner of the Northern Expedition. After occupying Wuhan, party members and politicians were active. The young people in Suzhou were particularly excited and secretly gathered to plan a response. Wang Bole and Liu Shiying were both giants of the Kuomintang and used the name of teachers and staff of Suzhou schools to spread the Three People's Principles. My brother did not slacken in protecting them. Wang and Liu were arrested and martyred. My brother was the most suspected, but he still resolutely sent a telegram condemning Governor Sun. Everyone was in danger for him. Sun knew that he had the support of the people and pretended to be tolerant but was actually jealous of him. Fortunately, the Northern Expeditionary Army divided its forces and went straight to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the matter was suppressed. However, it was also dangerous. In the winter of Ding Chou, Suzhou was in danger, and refugees from all over gathered at the station. The villagers formed a shelter, and my brother went back and forth to preside over the matter, taking Guangfu Town as a central location. The National Army retreated, and the garrison suspected that there were other plans, and reconnaissance was everywhere. My brother changed into monk's clothes to avoid attention. When the shelter was disbanded, my nephew brought funds to Shanghai to meet him, and then transferred him to Chongqing, where he took the position of senator in the Senate. Whenever he had suggestions, he never avoided the powerful and did not cater to the times. Therefore, he was always depressed and lived in Hong Kong, living a simple life. When my second nephew Wei Ding got married, it was on October 30th two years ago. My brother sailed from Hong Kong to Chongqing, and he escaped the fall of Hong Kong. All the things mentioned here were opportunities to die, but God almost deliberately hindered him and then let him go, as if he had great expectations. But now it's over! Although I am unworthy, I served as a lecturer in my youth and followed the official road as an adult. What my brother taught and encouraged me has entered my ears and been remembered in my heart. I dare not forget the meaning of success and failure and the integrity of life and death. Then, like my brother's purity and frankness, he died a worthy death, so what regrets does he have? However, when the extreme is reversed, the principles of Yi Jing are not false. Why didn't God slow down a little, so that my brother could be satisfied and let go with ease, and so that my brothers could also return to the old pass, see the comfort of the elders and brothers, but now the work is only one step away from completion, and the hatred is divided into three points. Then, can the younger brother who died later not be sad and have tears in his eyes? Alas!</p>

<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>The Second Brew Books and Bronze &amp; Stone Exhibition sponsored by the Hongying Library closed today. I am uneasy following Mr. Shen Zengqing and Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang in hosting this work for three or four months, and I am grateful for the support of domestic and foreign scholars and major celebrities. They have generously donated precious items, and I would like to express my respect here first! Also, Mr. Xia Jian Yong, Ye Yufu, Chen Taoyi, Chen Bin He, Pan Dingzhi, Tang Kuaichen, Yang Yu, Ma Gongyu, Wang Ya, Mei Lanfang, Shen Shijia, Ding Kouyan, and Yang Dabang, as well as Ms. Wu Qingxia, Ba Zuoyu, Zhou Lianxia, and Zhou Shuyun, who enthusiastically supported, are especially appreciated!</p>
<p>Nearly two hundred famous writers participated in this event, with four hundred items exhibited, all carefully selected and exquisitely packaged by experts (due to time constraints, a few were not packaged). Each item can be said to be famous and rare. The exhibition was scheduled for one week. We are grateful to the China Painting Academy, Chen Dingshan, Wang Buqian, and Xu Bangda, for their exceptional preferential treatment in renting the venue and their enthusiastic support for this charitable cause. Special thanks should be expressed!</p>
<p>Libraries are a social and cultural undertaking that complements education. In the history of library development in our country, it has not been a century. The predecessor of the Hongying Library was the Renwen Library, which was the Jiazi Society. Its nature was slightly biased towards modern history and economics. It was initially initiated by Mr. Shen Xinqing, Huang Boyu, Ma Junqing, Zhang Yiyi, and Zhang Junmai, with the aim of serving the people. The source of funds at that time came from people enthusiastic about this cause, such as Mr. Zhou Jingxian, Qian Xinzhi, Ouchu, Hu Bijian, Wang Rudang, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Gongquan, Liu Hongsheng, and Yan Yutang, who either provided annual funding or temporary donations. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ye Hongying, a business tycoon, visited the library, deeply approved of it, and generously donated funds, hence the current name. Since then, the library's economic situation can be called stable. The most commendable thing during this period is the continuous assistance from various writers, collectors, and publishing houses. After the Incident, the funds were reduced, most of the work was suspended, and it fell into a state of barely maintaining. As of now, the library has more than 150,000 volumes of books, 330,000 index cards of various types, and more than 1.8 million historical materials. The average number of readers per day is more than a thousand, mostly from the business, academic, and academic fields. Hongying has become one of the leading libraries in Shanghai, but it is difficult to maintain and still needs social support.</p>
<p>Libraries are "growing longer day by day." Running them requires specialized talent, and supporting library affairs requires considerable financial resources. Private libraries often find this difficult. Hongying's current monthly expenditure is only 10,000 yuan, but the total base interest and income available for the whole year is only 20,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 90,000 to 100,000 yuan each year. If personnel and work are restored and adjusted, the monthly expenditure would be about 30,000 yuan, which would be three times the current expenditure. The tireless and outstanding spirit of the two elders, Shen and Jiang, over the years will surely be admired by society. How to maintain this social and cultural undertaking in the coming disaster is what we are worried about day and night. This summer, Curator Shen turned eighty. People in the society felt that Mr. Shen had devoted twenty years of his efforts solely to Hongying, so they requested to use the birthday celebration funds to supplement the library's expenses and then held the birthday celebration. This was not Mr. Shen's original intention, but we are extremely grateful for the enthusiasm of the social people to maintain it. All the old funds from this Second Brew Exhibition will still be used to fund expenses. With the enthusiastic social undertakings and love of art among the people of Shanghai, I also believe that the grand occasion of the Second Brew Exhibition will be unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Navy <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Here, we must introduce the birthplace of Admiral Togo Heihachiro, the local gazetteer of Shimoarata.</p>
<p>The name Arata is said to have originated from the Satsuma Totada-cho 700 years ago, so it can be imagined that it is a very old place. However, it is only a place on the edge of the castle town, with only fishermen's houses, farmers' houses, or the residences of samurai who eat a small salary, scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>But there are also exceptions, such as the mansions of famous families such as the Kawakami and Kirei, which are located here. Other than that, they are all humble rooms that are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>After the Meiji Restoration, there was not much development in the area. According to the population survey of 1917, there were only 600 households. Recently, it has become prosperous due to the excavation of hot springs, which has increased it threefold.</p>
<p>In such a remote place, famous people emerged during the Meiji era, such as Masayoshi Matsukata, Marshal Kawamura Kageaki, etc.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the famous people of Kagoshima, led by Takamori Saigo, came from the so-called "lower" cold gates of the castle town, and Shimoarata was also a part of it. The poverty of the Matsukata family is the most famous. His virtuous mother, Kesako, often said that even thin rice porridge was not easy to get.</p>
<p>Like such a seaside village, a poor village, but the fish taken in this sea, called Arata fish, is famous for its deliciousness. This beach was used as a salt field for the Satsuma domain, and the name of Jiro Beach came from the farmer Kurumada Yojiro, who devoted himself to the development of the salt field.</p>
<p>The coast of Shimonota is historically important in Japan, first of all because of the Omifunate site and other historical sites. The so-called Omifunate is the naval factory of the old domain era, with marine corps, centered on the dock, captains, sailors, shipbuilding craftsmen, etc., all living in groups. In the era when steam warships were adopted at the end of the shogunate, the crew members were still the people of the Omifunate group. When we think of the relationship between the Japanese Navy and the Satsuma Navy, this area is an unforgettable place.</p>
<p>Speaking of military affairs, the competition of matchlock guns and Western-style guns, and the test firing of eighty-pound cannons, were all held on this coast. In particular, Shimazu Nariakira resolutely adopted French-style army training and educated three thousand elite soldiers, and the location was also on this coast. He decided to lead this elite army to the east to control the shogunate's arrogance. In July of the fifth year of Ansei, under the hot summer, he was personally directing the exercise when he fell ill and died.</p>
<p>The old camp site surrounded by several old pine trees still makes the Satsuma people mourn and shed tears.</p>
<p>What evokes our memories and cannot be forgotten is the fact that the fort was first created here. In the Bunkyu third year, the Huai Bin campaign, the most memorable first cannon was fired at the British warship. The remains of this fort have been weathered and are now like a whetstone, remaining in Tenpo Park. (Five)</p>
