<h3 id="c1">清兵與整警 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>參戰以後，各方面的視綫，自然首先會集中到軍事方面，集中到人力的動員方面但是過分的重視到這一方面，顯然是不必要的，因爲參戰的主要任務，是在更切實集中全國的人力和物力，以供政府作有組織有計劃的應用，以便協力大東亞戰爭，求東亞民族的最後解放。誠如我們所早經指出的，參戰後對日協力，電事方面應該是居於次要的地位，其原因就在這裏。然而我們並不是說參戰以後，仍舊可以維持過去的軍事現狀，這是不可能的，而且也是不應該的。中國如果沒有武裝力量以自力安定大東亞的接方，那就必須日本分出相當大量的軍隊在中國佔領區內，這樣就等於分散了大東亞作戰的友軍的實力。所以，在某種限度以內的整軍經武，還是必要的。不過，這就是一個最値得深長考慮的重大問題，我們站在老百姓的立塲，深覺有幾點應該籲請當局注意。</p>
<p>首先，現在說整軍經武，完全是以維持和平區的安全，協力日本鞏固大東亞戰爭的後方為限；而且這種中國自己的武裝力量的建立與發展，是在國家遭遇最艱若的局面之中進行的。在認淸了上述任務與環境的前提之下，就必須實行「精兵主義」。第一·軍隊的編制不能太龐大，太複雜，軍事的機構也不能太龐大太複雜，因爲太龐大了太複雜了，也許在表面上很輝煌燦爛，而實際上不免虛　國帑。第二·軍隊的數目不能徒求其多，因爲軍隊增多了，單單餉械給養幾項，就會壓迫政府加重人民的負担。那麼，縱使絕對不抽壯丁不拉夫，而結果還會增加人民的痛苦，所以求其保護安寗者，勢將造成擾亂安寗了。第三·軍隊的各級將校，不僅必須是熟嫻韜略的軍事專家，不能使門外漢瀾竽充數；而且還必須是受過相當嚴格的政治訓練的幹部，能够了解國際和國內的政治形勢，了解自己保護國家與人民的責任。這也就是我國古代著名軍事專家孫子所謂「選將」與「將將一之道。相反，如果「選將」不愼，「將將」無策，那麼縱使不致有「驕兵悍將」之禍，恐怕也不能責望其担負起目前艱苦時代的軍人的使命。而最重要的是第四，必須有嚴格的紀律。世界上以軍紀嚴格著名的如日·如德·他們的軍隊就都能完成其使命。反之，軍紀不嚴的軍隊，終必激起民怨沸騰，不僅葬送了軍隊自己，而且還給國家民族以最重的災禍。逾來本報曾接讀者投函，希望軍隊遵守紀律，愛護人民，建立鐵一樣的軍紀。我們認爲，只有上述四點起碼的要求獲得普遍而切實的實現，那麽，精兵主　就可算有了基礎，而新時代的使命才能充分的擔負起來，可告無愧。</p>
<p>不過，我們覺得爲了充分完成參戰任務，維持大東亞戰爭的後方安全，除了實現「精兵主義」的整軍經武之外，還必須注意於警政的整頓，建立新時代的警制，發揚警察爲人民爲社會衛士的力量。這裏在消極方面，希望完全改變人民過去輕視警察的傳統觀念。不過，同時就應該努力於警十警官合理的生活的維持。就目前警察的月餉情形來看，以本埠滬西區南市區爲例，每月不到百元，且須自理伙食。大家試想，這區區之數，本人吃粥之費也不够，何况警察不是和尙，和一般人民一樣需要贍養家屬老小，證樣稍有辦法的人，誰願意常警察？當了警察的人，如不翁營副業，如何能生活？在這種實際情形之下，而要高談整頓警政，發揚新警力量，豈不是强人所難？所以我們希望當局注意到這一點，趕快提高警察和警官的俸給，改善他們的物質生活。然後，第二步，從積極方面，加緊幹部的政治訓練和技術訓練，吸收各方面真正的人才，大量培養適合新時代需要的眞正能爲人民之衛士的新警容新幹部。我們從這　特別希望當局注意，在不能大規模建設軍隊發展軍隊的目前，在必須實行「精兵主義」政策的目前，整頓警察，發展警察的力量，在大東亞戰爭中鞏固後方，保障人權愛護人民的使命上，實具有第一重要的意義的。</p>
<p>當然，無論是精兵和整警，有一個前提必須緊緊的把握住，那就是先要政治上有辦法，和大公無私的吸收各方面的人才。此外，日本在精兵和警察制度方面，都有値得中國學習的地方，日本在盟國的立塲，也有協助的責任。當然，所有這些都是中國的內政，我們並不是希望日本來越俎代庖，而是希望日本站在友好的立塲，給予至誠的協助。</p>

<p>柏林二十一日海通社電　德國及義大利、昨分別與日本簽訂經濟協定、德方於此所發公報稱、德·日兩國政府、決加緊經濟提携、以充實經濟力量、完成復興歐洲及大東亞之工作、特訂立協定如下、（一）德·日兩國決加緊交換出產物、並在技術上互相合作、（二）德·日兩國加緊財政合作、以利貨款之淸償、（三）德·日當繼續保持密切合作，以實現其經濟政策、此事當由雙方政府派遣特別代表主持之、（四）雙方政府主管當局對本協定施行之細則、已予同意、（五）本協定於簽字日起發生效力、其有效期間、與一九四〇年九月二十七日所簽訂之德·義·日三國公約同、</p>

<p>日德部分</p>
<p>（甲）日·德關於經濟協力之協定、大日本帝國政府及大德國政府爲在此次建設大東亞及歐洲新秩序之戰爭中、舉其經濟　力互相援助、以爭取最後勝利、並謀在戰後分別在兩國經濟圈內、以廣泛之建設計劃實現足以確保各該民族共存、共榮之新秩序起見、故決意謀兩國間經濟協力之緊密、爲此兩國政府簽訂協定如左、</p>

<p>— 斯諾</p>
<p>英國星期六郵報於九月十二日登載愛特伽·斯諾這一篇從孟買以電報發出的印度通訊，內容比較具體，材料亦較爲廣泛，茲譯出以供参考。</p>
<p>—譯者—</p>
<p>尼赫魯本人對我設出令人驚訝的話語，他說：「過去五十年內派到印度來的英國人之中，克利浦斯是對印度害處最大的人，他不但侮辱了我們的信用，也侮學了我們的理性」。這樣想法的人，決不止尼赫魯一個人，大部份印度人都不再信賴英國的諾言，都以爲自由最好的保證，就是自由本身，而且要越早越好地取得自由。</p>
<p>更極端的人們，對英美中蘇全部不信任。當美國格拉第訪問團來到印度，調查協助印度實業家的可能性的時候，許多實業家只把格拉第當作是美國帝國主義者派來接收特權的。當蘇聯簽訂英蘇條約的時候，有些印度人以爲蘇聯不會把印度從英國人手裏解放出來了，就斥責它，背叛了印度。據尼赫魯告訴我，印度人中說中國好的人常會受到有些民族主義者尖利的批評。這些極端的人們簡直就想不到卽使英國現在讓印度自由還是要受國際時局的影響的，萬一軸心國得勝了，印度的自由立刻就會化爲烏有。</p>
<p>第三個，也是目前爆發衝突的最直接的原因，是英政府威信的衰落，那是今年春天英國在日本人手下吃了敗仗的結果。這個敗仗怎樣在羣衆之中產生廣泛的影饗，日本怎樣把英美的軍事能力和效率的威信，從亞洲人的腦筋中一掃而空，美國和英國人民是不甚了然的。</p>
<p>威信麼？就是這個，除了兌換　比以外，我們是沒有什麼威信了。這是自從我上一次訪問印度以來最大的變化。</p>
<p>第四，印度人曾深深地經騐到以種族成見和種族優劣的無稽之談爲基礎的一切形式的帝國主義的不平等待遇，最最有害一節，是最近當馬來亞和緬甸大撤退的時候，白種難民和棕種難民受到的待遇大有分別，無疑的，白種人民比較幸福，從被佔區回來的印度人在二十萬人以上，在全國各處廣播着他們的經騐。凡是他們傳播過故事的地方，都不相信英國人處理緊急事變的能力。</p>
<p>第五，印度的實業家和資本家們對於政府的戰時生產政策極爲不滿，我會和最重要的工業家談過話的。他們都認爲假使有正常的調整計劃，供給，和工業的合理化，生產可以增加兩倍至四倍。</p>
<p>格拉第告訴了我同樣的事。印度的實業家們毫無例外，他對我們談起官僚們的障礙，計劃的缺乏，效率的不足，和他們努力建造印度自給自足經濟的挫敗。我發現沒有一個人相信英國將於戰後放棄印度的。爲提供證據起見，他們舉出了很多例子，說明印度的工業發展是被封鎖着，主要的原因是由於英國戰後的需要。毫無疑義，甘地和國民大會充分地反映了印度資產階級的願望，印度資產階級資助着他們的活動。</p>
<p>第六，許多印度人對英國領導印度來作戰的能力頗有疑問。民族主義者們以爲在這個時候，政府要指揮得動最大多數的附和者，才能動員整個民矣從事戰爭。他們說，魏菲爾將軍的戰略認爲不須要印度民衆的擁護，仍然可以守住印度我還得補一句，魏菲爾和我的談論，可以說是證實了這一點的，爲證明動員民衆的必要，印度人把馬來亞，爪哇，和緬甸的潰敗，各中國蘇聯甚至菲律實的情形來對照。</p>
<p>有些事情，只有眞止的印度人的政府，能够加重擔於人民而不引起反叛的政府才辦得到，在這些事情之中，民族主義者對將來負責的內閣要求着以下各節。</p>
<p>目前工人和工業簡直是純粹爲利潤而工作着。總督下面的行政會議委員摩迪爵士對我坦白地承認了這個動機，即使不擴充工業，假如在這個動機上面加上了愛國主義，那麼工人和工廠都能大大的增加生產量。至於從被威脅的區域里遷移和疏散工廠以及工業合理化約計劃，是可以依照格拉第訪問團　提出的辦法來實現的。</p>
<p>難民和鄉村之中的失業者，應該像中國一樣在工業合作運動之類的方法中，受到敎育和訓練，學會制作戰時的貨品，應該使學生和受敎育的人們服務於國防事業，以代替兵員總限於在文盲數目極多的所謂軍事種族中徵慕的辦法。可以應用徵兵制度，而無論如何，必須大規模地實施軍事訓練。</p>
<p>應該採取政治訓練，以加强兵士平民的士氣，使他們曉得必須保衛新近得到的自由。這樣，工人們也不會像加爾各答，孟買以及其他各地發生過的那樣，在時局初初一緊的時候就粉紛逃散了。他們將把自己認爲是自由印度値得驕傲的公民，堅守着自己的職位。印度人民這就不會把非暴力的抵抗，來反對必要的國防措施了，他們會組織起來，在新的印度領導權之下，實行各種國防措施。印度將抬起頭來，抖掉自卑的心理，和世界的其餘部份合拍。</p>
<p>上述的一些理由，容有着値得非議之處，但事實上，印度人的政治意識中普遍地存在着這些信念和偏見，不管他們屬於何黨何派。</p>
<p>這些理由，相信現在行動起來，配合着盟國在歐洲抗戰中最大的危機，必能使聯合國家得到最深刻的影象，這些念頭今天激動着印度。</p>
<p>印度國民大會已經感覺到調協內部和調協全國的需要，而在民族運動之中，兩種意見開始很淸楚地分開了。第一種意見：一相情願地以爲軸心國是可以和解的，贊成對日本採取中立政策。這種意見的意識上的領導者，是前任國民大會主席的蘇已斯·鮑斯，他從英國人的監獄裏逃了出來，住在德國，常對印度，特別是孟加拉省的大批附和者的發表廣播演說。輿論之中的另一方面，則傾向於團結高於一切的主張，認爲只有以團結作爲基礎，才能很快地動員人民，抵抗軸心國把法國和中國的歷史重演於印度的企圖。這個意見，是由較小的然而效率極高的印度共產黨領導着的。</p>

<p>— 聶雲台</p>
<p>本文作者聶雲臺先生，年高德劭，樂善好施。近歲精研佛學，益發慈悲。布衣淡食，自奉彌儉，而以有餘，悉數布施，抱取諸社會，用之社會之旨。能聚能散，積極爲善。聞聶氏家世，七代昌盛，足見積德餘慶，初非倖致。縱不積錢貽子孫，而子孫均能繼志卓立，殊足使吾人之人生觀有新的啟發。茲篇所述，充分闡發「積錢」與「爲善」之至理，引證事實，歷歷如繪，一字一句，悉從經騐體味中寫出。尙盼讀者倍加留意，幸甚。</p>
<p>發財不難。保財最難。我住在上海五十餘年，看見發財的人很多。發財之後，有不到五年，十年就敗的；有二三十年即收的；有四五十年敗完的。我記得與先父往來的多數闊人，或官或商，都是煊赫一時的，現在均已多數凋零，家事沒落，有的是子孫揮霍一空，嫖賭不務正業，有的是連子孫都無影無踪了。大約屈指計數，四五十年的闊人，現在家務未全敗的，子孫能讀書務正上進的，百家之中實難得一二家。不獨上海爲然。在敝處湖南家鄕亦復如是。同洽光緒年間，中興時代的富貴人，封爵的有六七家，督撫二三十家，提鎭五六十家，現在多數蕭條了。內中文官多人，比較財產無多，後人較好。就我所熟悉的說：如會左彭李數家。錢最少者，後人比較多能讀書，以學術在社會服務。會文正公曾孫輩，六七人在國內外大學畢業，三人充大學敎授。左文襄公曾孫數人，亦以科學專門，李勇毅公孫曾輩有充大學敎授，曾孫多犬學畢業。彭剛直公後人，十年前有在上海做官的，大概當時的錢來得正路，無積蓄留錢與子孫之心，子孫就比較爲賢才、其餘文官比較錢多的十數家，現在後人多數蕭條。武官數十家，當時皆比文官富，有十萬二十萬的，（多數係戰事平　，繼續統兵，可以缺額，始能發財。至有五六十萬，近百萬的不過三四家。如郭席楊等均係後來從陝甘及雲貴軍務歸來者。金陵克復時，文正因湘軍暮氣，急裁湘軍。剿捻時改用淮軍，故湘軍老將富者極少。）各家後人亦多數衰落，能讀書上進的，耳中殊少聽見。我家與中興各大世家或湘或淮，多數爲通家瓜葛，故各家興衰情形，略有所知，至安徽文武各大家，前時富厚達勝湘軍諸人，今都彫零，不堪回首。前後不過幾十年，傳下纔到第三代，已都如浮雲故盡。然而當時不肯發財，不爲子孫積錢的幾家，子孫却多優秀，最聰明的　曾文正公，位最高，權最重，在位二十年，死時止有銀二萬兩，除鄉間老屋外，省中未造第宅，未買田一畝，手創兩淮鹽票，定價極康，利息甚厚，（票價二百兩，後來售至二萬兩，每年租息三四千兩，當時家有鹽票一紙，即稱富家。）公特論曾氏一家，不准承領。公逝多年，後人無一鹽票。若當時化些字號，花名領一二百張，極其容易。而且是照章領票，表面並不違法。然而借着政權地位，取巧營私，小人認爲無碍，君子之所不爲。此事當時家母聞知其詳，外間少有知者。中庸說的：「君子之不可及者，其爲人之所不見乎。」這叫做表裏如一，係中國政冶學的根本。若無此根本，一切政治的路，都行不通。現代的政治學家，大須注意。</p>

<h3 id="c51">後起之秀—鋁 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 立名</p>
<p>「白白的，有些亮光，當然，不是銅也不會是鐵做的，可又不是洋鐵皮，這不像洋鐵皮那末軟呀？」</p>
<p>「倒有些像家裏煮湯用的洋鐵鍋呢！」</p>
<p>現代縮短空間的交通工具，和爆炸敵方工事的戰爭利器—飛機，它本身的材料，主要就是這種東西。</p>
<p>這是無怪其然的。在我們的頭腦裏，是很難有機會留下這種金屬的印象的。它既非銅鐵，又不是鋁或鋅（洋鐵皮是鋅做的），色白，有晶瑩的光輝，但又非常輕，所以才用來做飛機的外殼和機件。這是任何我們所知道的金屬都沒有的好處。誰都知道，五金材料，總是笨重不堪的。</p>
<p>所以，在「萬事莫如空防急」的今日，這一種又輕又亮的金屬，成了風頭最健的東西了，它的名字，叫做—「鋁」。</p>
<p>其實，鋁的正式出世爲人所發現，還是近四十年的事。不過，它是「生逢其時」，正合了近代航空工業的需要，所以才短短幾十年功夫，便成了最走紅運的金屬，而古代人類早就發現利用的銅鐵之類，倒反而黯然無色。所以我們常說：「鋁是金屬裏面的後起之秀」。</p>
<p>鋁，在人類所能够應用的各種金屬之中，雖然是發現得最遲的一種，但是在事實上鋁並不是一種稀有的東西。在實際調查研究所得的結果，在六十公里厚的地殼裏所含各種金屬中，鋁的儲藏量居第一位，如以銅之儲量作爲一則鎳爲一〇，鎂爲一二〇〇，鐵爲二二〇〇，而鋁則爲四〇〇〇，其豐富可想而知了。</p>
<p>鋁所以不能很早問世的原因，大部分是在製造方面的困難，因爲鋁的化學性質非常活潑，牠的氧化物不能用通常的炭來還原，所以在最初單體鋁的製造是拿金屬鉀和氯化鋁的作用而取得的。金屬鉀本就是一種極昂貴的藥品，製出來的鋁，售價更高達每磅一百六十餘金元。其後雖然在製造方法上，有些改進，但始終不能用做普遍實用的材料。</p>
<p>在西曆一八八六年，美國人荷爾首先試騐以電解法製鋁，到一八九〇年方才達到完全的成功，由於電解法之簡便價廉，鋁之應用日益增加，近年以來，大有超越銅鐵的趨勢，無論交通製造國防以及其他各種工業部門，鋁都是不可缺少的重要原料了。</p>
<p>鋁之比重約爲二·七，在商業上鋁的純度通常由九八％到九九·五％，其餘雜質多爲銅鐵和砂等，近來由於冶金學進步的結果，最純的鋁可達九九·九九八％。</p>
<p>純鋁最主要的用途有下列幾種：</p>
<p>（一）用於製鋼工業——把鋁攙在銅裏，可以驅除鋼中殘留的氣體，以得到堅實的鋼塊，又鋁昨增加鎔鋼的流動性，所以用鋁可得比較精明繁複鋼鑄品。</p>
<p>（二）用於鎔接的工程——鋁與氧的親和力很强，如果把鋁紛和氧化劑（如氧化鐵，氯酸鉀等）二者均勻地混合以後，即能起氧化作用而燃燒，其燃燒的溫度可達五四〇〇度的高熟，遠在鋼鐵鎔點以上，所以用鋁鎔接鋼鐵，頗有事半功倍的效果。英國新製的某種燃燒彈，就是用鋁和氧化鐵和勻製成的，燒起來，不但溫度極高，而且普通的水龍以及藥沫滅火機都無法撲滅的。</p>
<p>（三）純鋁極不易與空氣起化合作用用化學的術語來說，是「抗蝕性」很强。所以常用鋁來製較精良的日用器具，和科學儀器。</p>
<p>（四）用於電氣工業——鋁的導電性相當高，差不多是銅的百分之六十左右，這要比一般金屬如鐵鋅鎳等好得多了。因此，近來對於高座電的輸送方面，用鋁綫的很多，而且若是在鋁製的紋織中間，揷入一根鋼綫做心，這樣製成的「鋼心繩」的抗拉强度可以比一般銅絲還要大好幾倍。</p>
<p>因鋁的抗蝕性很高，雖在海水裏面也不容易受到侵蝕，比起其他的金屬要好得多了，這一點在造船工業裏是相當重要的。鋁如暴露在空氣裏面，則很容易被空氣裏的氧所氧化而於表面生一層氧化膜（Oxide　film）此層氧化膜的組織非常密緻，可以保護內層，使不致繼續受到氧化作用，這一點實在可以說鋁本身的幸運，因爲如果氧化可以繼續到裏面去的話，那麼鋁在工業上將要變成爲毫無價値的東西了，那裏會有現在這樣重要呢？</p>
<p>除了上面所說的好處而外，還有一個大家所知道的特點，那就是鋁是最輕金屬。這就使它成爲飛機工業中的重要原料。</p>
<p>但實際上問題却還並不如此簡單，純鋁有一個很大的缺點：不硬。飛機是要時時準備抗擋敵人射來的子彈的，總不能用豆腐皮來做外殼呀，在這一點上鋼是最合要求的了，但又可惜太重，飛機有些「負担不起」，所以飛機工業還是要想利用這輕金屬的鋁，但若不能使這軟軟的鋁變硬起來，鋁也要和鋼一樣被丟在一邊的。</p>
<p>這個困難，很快就得到解決，即以別種適當的金屬，配定適當的成分，和鋁合鑄成「合金」，就可以成爲又輕又硬又耐用的理想的金屬。這就是所謂「鋁合金」了。（酬移濟貧金）</p>

<h3 id="c53">霓裳曲觀感 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 芒刺</p>
<p>姚克先生在特刋裏自己介紹道：「霓裳曲是一本相當好的驚奇劇Thriller。」什麼叫驚奇劇！據姚先生的解釋，是不講究人物個性刻劃，純以「劇情新奇，排塲緊凑爲主」的。</p>
<p>這驚奇劇的定義能否成立，姑置不論；單以觀後印象來說，我覺得俗氣得很，充其量，一本最下劣的美國電影而已，看慣電影的人，閉着眼也能想像得出，又哪裏有什麼「新奇」之可言呢？偵探捉强盜，這是G-man型；盜窟遇艷，這是boy-meets　girl．公式；末了，再加上happy　ending：總之，這是十足Yankee氣味的噱頭，謂之噱頭則可，自吹自擂「相當好」云云，則我不得不佩服姚先生的大胆。</p>
<p>我們不妨把最精彩的台辭引幾句在這裏：</p>
<p>阿寳：穿了睡衣會客，好倒是很好，就怕沒娶媳婦的小夥子看見了有點那個。</p>
<p>紅瑛：你怎麽知道他沒結過婚？</p>
<p>阿寳：要是結過了婚，他明天決不會大淸早就來，他起不來。……</p>
<p>够了！這幾句台辭，就十足叫人聽了有點「那個。」</p>
<p>姚克先生口口聲聲在辯明：他的驚奇劇不能以「意識」來評衡，但以上云云，不就是「惡少意識」的表現麼？須知意識二字，不是喊兩句「你是光明的姑娘」就算的，而是表露在作者的字裏行間，隨便怎麽遮掩也遮掩不了的。儘管姚先生從美國稗販來「驚奇劇」……什麼劇那一套新術語，至少，對觀衆敎育問題他總應該負責。假使說，形式新鮮就該介紹過來，那麼，美國還有Vaudeville（無聊的舞劇），burlesque（大腿舞），難道都可以採用麼？</p>
<p>退一步，就算肯定姚先生走的路是對的，這裏也還有一個問題：劇本裏的「合理化」該如何講？姚先生說：「……並不苛求劇情的絕對眞實性和合理化，只要不太荒謬無理就合格。」這等於沒有說。因爲他對合理化並未給予明確的界說。</p>
<p>我的意見正相反；如果是一部好作品的話，佈局無理是可以的。浮士德，難道找們眞相信他會和魔鬼打交道？「荒島英雄」裏的一家人，難道眞相信他們會吃老王的虧？「藝術誇張」的好處，就在以不眞實的事件，激起對眞實的更深刻的認識。然而，「霓裳曲」的不眞實，我們只能說牠是兒戲！</p>
<p>姚先生對小關節目是頗爲留心的，（如「蝴蝶回原」，「義務戲」等對話，虧他想得出！）但整個的劇結構則牽强無比，矛盾百出。孫玉庭一上來就跟紅瑛鬧翻，按道理，決不會把已到手的肥肉輕輕放過，但紅瑛騙說凌雲是未婚夫，孫玉庭就走開不管。走開之後，却又興帥動衆地派人來監視，打探……身爲私販首領，何以竟幼稚得像小孩一樣？凌雲的態度也古怪得出奇，先是不願做未婚夫，後來紅瑛告訴他消息已經傳出，倒反而答應下來。紅瑛對孫玉庭懼怕到如何程度，也叫人捉摸不定。……總之，孫玉庭，紅瑛，凌雲間的關係，壓根就是一篇算不淸的糊塗賬。</p>
<p>演員方面，喬奇飾性格粗魯的凌雲，尙有可取。餘下就不足談。最成問題的是龔家寳和飾阿寶的周凈。阿寳是一女僕，但周凈燙髮塗口紅，遠望去比主角白虹還漂亮。龔家寳身似博浪鼓，一面談話，一面老在搖擺個不停。</p>
<p>揷曲有三支，但「心靈」不慣「坐沙發椅」的我，實聽不出好處來。</p>
<p>最後，我對姚先生引的蕭伯納自認爲吹牛家的名義，並不特別贊成。蕭伯納有他的作品作保證；以蕭伯納爲護符者，也該躬自反省：自己有沒有蕭伯納那樣値得吹的作品。</p>

<p>黃包車夫，在目前上海的職業圈裏，事實上，還算吃得飽的一行。可是，他們終日奔馳，寒暑無間，僅得一飽，生活沒有保陣，也該値得同情的。</p>
<p>某次集會上，聽到一位長者的意見，他說黃包車夫的生活要得保障，只有儲蓄的一法。譬如目前黃包車夫向車主租一輛車，每天要付車租二元，就在這二元裏，要求車主提取一角，再由車夫自己拿出一角，合起來儲蓄，如果以利上滾利計算，三年以後，就有一輛車的存款，五年就有二輛，十年以後，車夫就變成車主，做到「拉車者有其車」，那時生活就有保障了。這是很具體而合理的辦法，如果黃包車夫能够團結起來，實行也並不困難。</p>
<p>其實，這個辦法，在一般機關或團體裏面，實行的已經很多。就是在職工薪水裏每日扣幾分之幾，以之儲蓄，而由機關或團體，津貼一部份，調之陪儲，經過相當時期，數目確很可觀。這種勞資互利的辦法，實有積極提倡的必要。</p>

<p>After joining the war, the focus of all parties will naturally first concentrate on military affairs and the mobilization of manpower. However, overemphasizing this aspect is obviously unnecessary, because the main task of joining the war is to more effectively concentrate the nation's manpower and material resources for the government to use in an organized and planned way, in order to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and seek the final liberation of the East Asian nations. As we have long pointed out, cooperation with Japan in military affairs after joining the war should be of secondary importance, and the reason lies here. However, we are not saying that after joining the war, we can still maintain the past military status quo. This is impossible and should not be done. If China does not have armed forces to stabilize the border areas of Greater East Asia on its own, then Japan must allocate a considerable number of troops to occupy Chinese territories, which is tantamount to dispersing the strength of the allied forces fighting in Greater East Asia. Therefore, a certain degree of military reorganization is still necessary. However, this is a major issue that deserves deep consideration. Standing in the position of the common people, we deeply feel that there are several points that should be brought to the attention of the authorities.</p>
<p>First of all, the current military reorganization is entirely limited to maintaining the security of the peace zone and assisting Japan in consolidating the rear of the Greater East Asia War; moreover, the establishment and development of this Chinese armed force is being carried out in the midst of the country's most difficult situation. Under the premise of recognizing the above-mentioned tasks and environment, it is necessary to implement "elite troops." First, the organization of the army should not be too large or too complex, and the military structure should not be too large or too complex, because if it is too large and too complex, it may appear glorious on the surface, but in reality, it will inevitably waste national resources. Second, the number of troops should not be increased blindly, because with the increase in the number of troops, the costs of salaries, weapons, and supplies alone will force the government to increase the burden on the people. Then, even if no conscription is carried out, the result will still increase the suffering of the people, so those who seek to protect peace will inevitably create unrest. Third, the generals at all levels of the army must not only be military experts who are proficient in strategy, and not allow laymen to fill the ranks; they must also be cadres who have received considerable rigorous political training, who can understand the international and domestic political situation, and understand their responsibility to protect the country and the people. This is what Sun Tzu, the famous ancient Chinese military expert, called the way of "selecting generals" and "leading generals." On the contrary, if "selecting generals" is not careful and "leading generals" is ineffective, then even if there is no disaster of "arrogant soldiers and brave generals," I am afraid that they cannot be expected to take on the mission of soldiers in the current difficult era. And most importantly, fourth, there must be strict discipline. Countries that are known for strict military discipline, such as Japan and Germany, have been able to complete their missions with their armies. Conversely, an army with lax military discipline will eventually arouse popular resentment, not only burying the army itself, but also bringing the heaviest disaster to the country and the nation. In the past, this newspaper has received letters from readers hoping that the army will abide by discipline, care for the people, and establish iron-like military discipline. We believe that only when the above four basic requirements are universally and effectively realized can the principle of elite troops be considered to have a foundation, and the mission of the new era can be fully undertaken without regret.</p>
<p>However, we feel that in order to fully complete the task of participating in the war and maintaining the security of the rear of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to implementing the "elite troops" policy of military reorganization, we must also pay attention to the rectification of police administration, establish a new era of police system, and promote the power of the police as guardians of the people and society. Here, in a negative sense, we hope to completely change the traditional concept of the people's past contempt for the police. However, at the same time, efforts should be made to maintain a reasonable life for police officers. Judging from the current monthly salary of the police, taking the Xuhui and Nanshi districts of Shanghai as examples, it is less than 100 yuan per month, and they have to take care of their own meals. Everyone can imagine that this small amount is not enough to pay for the porridge for themselves, let alone that the police are not monks and need to support their families like ordinary people. Who is willing to be a policeman if they have any other means? How can people who become police officers live without engaging in side businesses? Under this kind of reality, is it not asking the impossible to talk highly about rectifying the police administration and promoting the power of the new police? Therefore, we hope that the authorities will pay attention to this point and quickly increase the salaries of police officers and improve their material lives. Then, the second step is to strengthen the political and technical training of cadres, absorb genuine talents from all aspects, and cultivate a large number of new police cadres who are suitable for the needs of the new era and can truly be guardians of the people. From this point, we especially hope that the authorities will pay attention to the fact that in the current situation where it is not possible to build and develop the army on a large scale, in the current situation where it is necessary to implement the "elite troops" policy, rectifying the police and developing the power of the police is of primary importance in consolidating the rear, protecting human rights, and caring for the people in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Of course, whether it is elite troops or police reorganization, there is a prerequisite that must be firmly grasped, that is, there must first be political solutions and selfless absorption of talents from all aspects. In addition, Japan has things worth learning from in terms of elite troops and police systems, and Japan also has a responsibility to assist as an allied country. Of course, all of these are China's internal affairs. We do not hope that Japan will overstep its authority, but hope that Japan will provide sincere assistance from a friendly standpoint.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 11:00 a.m. on the 21st that Japan, Germany, and Italy have signed an economic agreement. After the representatives of Japan and Germany signed the agreement at the German leader's headquarters, Foreign Minister Tani, German Ambassador Ott, and the head of the German economic mission, Veltat, established three agreements in Tokyo, including specific details on trade, technical cooperation, and payment. Details on the implementation of the Japan-Italy agreement are still under discussion between Japan and Italy.</p>
<p>German Leader's Headquarters, 21st (Haitong News Agency) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima signed an economic agreement here yesterday. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also signed a similar agreement with the Japanese Charge d'Affaires to Italy, Kasai, in Rome on the same day. The validity period of these agreements is the same as that of the Tripartite Pact. Germany, Italy, and Japan will intensify economic cooperation in the spirit of the Tripartite Pact in the future. The economic circles of Europe and Greater East Asia must be developed as much as possible to meet the needs of the all-out war. The eternal economic cooperation between Germany, Italy, and Japan after the war can also be based on this.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano signed the Japan-Italy Economic Cooperation Agreement with the Japanese Charge d'Affaires to Italy, Kase Shunichi, on the 20th.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) The Italian government announced on the 21st the Japan-Italy Economic Cooperation Agreement signed by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Japanese Charge d'Affaires Kase, consisting of five articles.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The Japanese Emperor and Empress gave a banquet at the Toyoakei Palace at noon on the 21st to entertain Ambassador Ott and his wife to show their appreciation for Ambassador Ott's contributions to strengthening Japan-Germany relations since his arrival.</p>
<p>Official Statements from Japan and Germany</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The third director of the Japanese Information Bureau issued a statement on the conclusion of the economic agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy as follows: On September 27, Showa 15 (1940), Japan, Germany, and Italy, based on the Tripartite Pact, mutually recognized the guiding position in the construction of the Greater East Asia and European New Orders, and agreed to cooperate with each other to achieve this goal. This is a epoch-making driving force for the construction of a new world order. Due to the strong promotion, the construction of the Greater East Asia and European New Orders has begun to yield results. This economic agreement is a manifestation of the spirit of the Tripartite Pact in the economic field. The conclusion of this agreement fully demonstrates that the construction of the new order has reached a concrete stage. The economic cooperation between the three countries will become closer in the future. In addition, this agreement breaks the international economic system monopolized by the United Kingdom and the United States in the past, and adopts a direct settlement method between Japan, Germany, and Italy, which is also of great significance. Therefore, it is firmly believed that the cooperation between the three countries will become more and more solid in both material and spiritual aspects, which will not only be beneficial to the completion of the war, but also make a great contribution to the new world based on justice after the war.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) Germany and Italy signed economic agreements with Japan yesterday. The German side issued a communiqué stating that the German and Japanese governments have decided to intensify economic cooperation to strengthen their economic power and complete the work of restoring Europe and Greater East Asia. A agreement is hereby concluded as follows: (1) Germany and Japan shall intensify the exchange of products and cooperate with each other technically. (2) Germany and Japan shall intensify financial cooperation to facilitate the settlement of loans. (3) Germany and Japan shall continue to maintain close cooperation to realize their economic policies. This matter shall be presided over by special representatives dispatched by the two governments. (4) The competent authorities of the two governments have agreed to the details of the implementation of this agreement. (5) This agreement shall take effect from the date of signature and shall be valid for the same period as the Tripartite Pact signed by Japan, Germany, and Italy on September 27, 1940.</p>
<p>Contents of the Tripartite Agreement Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Regarding the conclusion of the economic cooperation agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the Information Bureau announced on the 21st as follows: On January 20 of this year, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop signed the Japan-Germany Agreement on Economic Cooperation at the German Leader's Headquarters. On the same day, Japanese Charge d'Affaires to Italy Kase and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano signed the Japan-Italy Agreement on Economic Cooperation. The validity period is the same as that of the Tripartite Pact. It can be said that it is an extremely large agreement that concretely realizes its aims in the economic field and strengthens the Tripartite Pact. Japan, Germany, and Italy have always strengthened their political ties established by the Tripartite Pact. Now, they have concluded two economic agreements to establish grand economic plans and strive to mobilize the total strength of the two major economic spheres of Greater East Asia and Europe, implement the war to defeat the common enemy, and establish a foundation for the two major economic circles to permanently cooperate economically after the war. Therefore, in addition to stipulating the exchange of various economic works to promote each other, the two agreements also stipulate the implementation of cooperation in economic and financial aspects. The contents of the Japan-Germany and Japan-Italy agreements are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan-Germany Section</p>
<p>(A) Agreement on Economic Cooperation between Japan and Germany. The Government of the Great Japanese Empire and the Government of the Great German Empire, in order to mutually assist each other with their economic strength in this war to build a new order in Greater East Asia and Europe and strive for final victory, and to realize a new order sufficient to ensure the coexistence and co-prosperity of each nation within the economic circles of the two countries after the war, have decided to seek closer economic cooperation between the two countries. To this end, the two governments have signed the agreement as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 Japan and Germany shall, in all sectors, exert their full efforts to promote and implement economic cooperation within their respective economic spheres. The two countries shall assist each other in adjusting materials and equipment, and implement close economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Article 2 Japan and Germany, in order to facilitate the management of funds required for the implementation of the provisions of the preceding article, shall implement close cooperation in finance.</p>
<p>Article 3 Japan and Germany, in order to implement their economic policies more effectively, shall maintain close contact. Therefore, the two governments shall specially instruct their appointed commissioners to pay attention to the development of economic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Article 4 The relevant officials of the two governments shall agree on the details necessary for the implementation of this agreement.</p>
<p>Article 5 This agreement shall be implemented from the date of signature and shall be valid for the same period as the Tripartite Pact signed by Japan, Germany, and Italy on September 27, Showa 15 (ie, September 27, 1940).</p>
<p>(B) The full text of the Japan-Italy Agreement on Economic Cooperation is completely the same as the Japan-Germany Agreement, and is omitted.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The concrete negotiations for the conclusion of the epoch-making economic cooperation agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy began in the spring of 1941. At that time, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima and Minister Matsushima began to negotiate with the Trade Bureau of the German Foreign Ministry. At the same time, the German side specially appointed Dr. Veltat, Director of the Four-Year Plan Bureau, as the head of the economic mission, composed of key members of the diplomatic, economic, and food departments and important personnel from the central bank, to visit Japan in April of the same year. Dr. Veltat was highly valued by German Marshal Goering. Under the guidance of Foreign Minister Matsuoka at that time, the Japanese side, with Foreign Ministry Advisor Saito Ryoei as the center, began to exchange opinions with the German Trade Bureau. As a result, in just over two months, the opinions of both sides were completely一致. However, in June of the same year, the German-Soviet War broke out, so this basic plan had to be re-examined. By December of the same year, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a third revision of the content was made. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it was necessary to completely update matters such as material exchange, technical cooperation, and trade settlement methods. The negotiations between Japan and Italy began when the outline of the Japan-Germany negotiations had been roughly decided. Representatives of the two countries actively negotiated in Tokyo and Rome, so it was concluded at the same time as the Japan-Germany agreement this time.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Fierce Fighting Currently Occurring Near Tripoli British Forces' Attack Repelled Again French Forces in Tunisia Suffer Damage <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>German Leader's Headquarters, 21st (Haitong News Agency) The German military report this afternoon stated that the British Eighth Army sent a large army and tanks yesterday to advance eastward, but was repelled by German and Italian armored vehicles. Our emergency dive bombers participated in the battle and achieved success, and three British fighter planes were shot down. In the past two days, the enemy's elite troops launched a counterattack against our newly occupied positions in Tunisia, but the situation on the ground in several places has improved significantly. The number of enemy captured and the spoils of war have increased. Our aircraft attacked a convoy near Algiers in several batches, sinking two transport ships with a total of 18,000 tons, and nine freighters were severely damaged, three of which caught fire.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Haitong News Agency) The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that as a result of the three-day great battle in Tunisia, 1,500 enemy soldiers were captured, 30 enemy motorcycles were destroyed, and countless military supplies were seized, including 30 cannons and dozens of machine guns. Within Tripoli, the Axis forces continued to operate according to plan. The Italian air force and artillery repeatedly bombed enemy tank convoys. German fighter planes shot down three Spitfire enemy planes, and two other enemy planes were shot down by the army. When enemy planes attacked Sousse in Tunisia, one was destroyed by the army and fell into the sea. Italian long-range bombers attacked Volos Port, one ship was hit and caught fire, and another ship was severely damaged. Our bomber group attacked Algiers Port, two ships were hit, one of which had sunk. The German air force bombed a convoy near the coast of Algeria, one ship sank and eight were damaged, totaling 49,000 tons. Later, the convoy was attacked by our torpedo planes, one large ship of 10,000 tons was sunk, and another large ship was severely damaged. Several enemy ships in the western Mediterranean were repeatedly attacked by torpedo planes at night, three ships sank and another was severely damaged.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 21st (Havas News Agency) It is reported that General Arnim has replaced General Mellin as the commander-in-chief of the Axis forces in Tunisia. General Arnim is known as a military expert and is taking on this important position for the first time.</p>
<p>Conference Held in Cairo to Discuss North African War Situation</p>
<p>Ankara, 21st (Haitong News Agency) According to news from Cairo, after British Cabinet Representative to the Near East Casey returned to Cairo, a meeting was held immediately. British military and civil authorities attended. This meeting was clearly to discuss the North African war situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Domei News Agency) According to news from North Africa relayed here, the Allied Command in French North Africa admitted yesterday that the Allied forces invading Tunisia had suffered setbacks again. It is disclosed that the Axis forces moved southwest from Pont du Fahs in southern Tunisia and advanced about seven miles. A Reuters reporter last night reported from the Allied Command, detailing the Axis victory, saying, "Although the British field artillery and flat-trajectory gun teams assisted General Giraud's French rebel army to resist the frequent pressure from the German army southwest of Pont du Fahs, the German army, with the assistance of tanks and aircraft, entered seven miles on the road from Pont du Fahs to Rougga. The fierce resistance of the Allied forces was ineffective." News from Berlin said that the French army suffered heavy losses, with more than 1,000 captured and a considerable loss of war equipment. German infantry and tanks attacked the important mountain positions, then cooperated with the Italian army to surround a large number of French rebel forces and are gradually eliminating them. The German army north of Bou Arada repelled the French army's attack and consolidated its position in a fierce encounter. Several British reconnaissance teams north of Medjez el Bab were ambushed and captured by German motorized troops. At the same time, Axis aircraft heavily attacked the Axis forces concentrated in Tunisia and bombed the port of Bone on the Algerian coast on the night of January 19, destroying military targets there. According to German news, General Rommel of Tripoli proved again that his defensive tactics were superior to those of British General Montgomery. The British Eighth Army launched a fierce attack on the southern part of the German Africa Corps on Tuesday morning, but was driven back by intense artillery fire. In the afternoon, the British army launched another attack and was repelled again. Axis air combat assistance was quite successful. In this battle, the British army lost 32 tanks and armored vehicles, more than 60 transport vehicles, and a number of cannons.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency) The Allied Headquarters in North Africa stated that the German army clearly intends to drive the Allied forces out of central Tunisia so that they cannot attack the ports of Sousse and Sfax, because the coast of Tunisia has become indispensable for the Axis forces near the port of Tunis and General Rommel's troops to establish contact. According to Axis sources, fierce fighting is currently taking place near the port of Tripoli. The French secessionist troops occupying the mountains south of the port were attacked by German mountain troops and have been surrounded. An Italian army team also participated in the battle. The French secessionist troops are in a desperate situation. General Montgomery launched two offensives yesterday, but both were repelled. However, there are still signs that the British army is preparing to attack again.</p>
<h3 id="e6">January 10th, from Macau: Must Britain Abandon India? (3) <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Snow</p>
<p>The Saturday Evening Post published this telegram dispatch from Bombay by Edgar Snow on September 12th. The content is relatively specific, and the material is quite extensive. I am translating it for reference.</p>
<p>—Translator—</p>
<p>Nehru himself set forth surprising words to me, saying, "Among the British who have been sent to India in the past fifty years, Cripps is the person who has done the most harm to India. He has not only insulted our credibility but also insulted our reason." Those who think this way are certainly not limited to Nehru alone. Most Indians no longer trust British promises and believe that the best guarantee of freedom is freedom itself, and they want to obtain freedom as early as possible.</p>
<p>Even more extreme people distrust Britain, America, China, and the Soviet Union entirely. When the American Grady mission came to India to investigate the possibilities of assisting Indian industrialists, many industrialists regarded Grady only as an American imperialist sent to take over privileges. When the Soviet Union signed the Anglo-Soviet treaty, some Indians thought that the Soviet Union would not liberate India from the hands of the British and condemned it for betraying India. According to Nehru, those who say China is good among Indians are often subjected to sharp criticism from some nationalists. These extreme people simply cannot imagine that even if Britain now gives India freedom, it will still be affected by the international situation, and if the Axis powers win, India's freedom will immediately vanish.</p>
<p>The third, and also the most direct cause of the current outbreak of conflict, is the decline of the British government's prestige, which was the result of Britain's defeat at the hands of the Japanese this spring. The American and British people do not quite understand how this defeat produced widespread influence among the masses and how Japan swept away the prestige of the military capabilities and efficiency of Britain and America from the minds of Asians.</p>
<p>Prestige? That's it. Apart from the exchange rate of the rupee, we have no prestige. This is the biggest change since my last visit to India.</p>
<p>Fourth, the most harmful aspect is that Indians have deeply experienced all forms of unequal treatment of imperialism based on racial prejudice and the absurd idea of racial superiority. Most harmful aspect was the great difference in the treatment of white refugees and brown refugees during the recent great retreat from Malaya and Burma. Undoubtedly, the white people were more fortunate. More than 200,000 Indians returned from the occupied areas and broadcast their experiences throughout the country. Wherever they spread their stories, people did not believe in the ability of the British to handle emergencies.</p>
<p>Fifth, Indian industrialists and capitalists are extremely dissatisfied with the government's wartime production policy. I have spoken with the most important industrialists. They all believe that if there is a normal adjustment plan, supply, and industrial rationalization, production can be increased two to four times.</p>
<p>Grady told me the same thing. Without exception, Indian industrialists talked to us about the obstacles of bureaucrats, the lack of planning, the inadequacy of efficiency, and the frustration of their efforts to build India's self-sufficient economy. I found that no one believed that Britain would give up India after the war. To provide evidence, they cited many examples to illustrate that India's industrial development was being blocked, mainly due to Britain's post-war needs. There is no doubt that Gandhi and the National Congress fully reflect the wishes of the Indian bourgeoisie, who finance their activities.</p>
<p>Sixth, many Indians have doubts about Britain's ability to lead India to war. Nationalists believe that at this time, the government must be able to command the largest majority of supporters in order to mobilize the entire people to engage in war. They say that General Wavell's strategy believes that it is not necessary for the Indian people to support it in order to defend India. I have to add that Wavell's discussion with me can be said to have confirmed this point. To prove the necessity of mobilizing the people, the Indians compared the defeats of Malaya, Java, and Burma with the situations in China, the Soviet Union, and even the Philippines.</p>
<p>Some things can only be done by a truly Indian government, a government that can increase the burden on the people without causing rebellion. Among these things, the nationalists demand the following from the cabinet responsible for the future.</p>
<p>Currently, workers and industries are simply working purely for profit. Sir Mody, a member of the Executive Council under the Governor-General, frankly admitted this motive to me. Even without expanding industry, if patriotism is added to this motive, workers and factories can greatly increase production. As for the plan to relocate and evacuate factories from the threatened areas and industrial rationalization, it can be realized in accordance with the methods proposed by the Grady mission.</p>
<p>Refugees and the unemployed in rural areas should be educated and trained in methods such as industrial cooperative movements, like in China, to learn how to make wartime goods. Students and educated people should be made to serve in the national defense cause, instead of the method of limiting recruitment to the so-called military races with extremely high illiteracy rates. A conscription system can be applied, and in any case, military training must be implemented on a large scale.</p>
<p>Political training should be adopted to strengthen the morale of soldiers and civilians, so that they know that they must defend their newly obtained freedom. In this way, workers will not flee in droves when the situation first becomes tight, as has happened in Calcutta, Bombay, and other places. They will recognize themselves as proud citizens of a free India, holding on to their positions. The Indian people will not use non-violent resistance to oppose necessary national defense measures. They will organize and implement various national defense measures under the leadership of the new India. India will raise its head, shake off its inferiority complex, and keep pace with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Some of the above reasons may have points that are worthy of criticism, but in fact, these beliefs and prejudices generally exist in the political consciousness of Indians, regardless of which party or faction they belong to.</p>
<p>These reasons, I believe, acting now, coupled with the greatest crisis of the Allied forces in the European war, will surely give the Allied nations the deepest impression. These thoughts are agitating India today.</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress has felt the need to coordinate internally and coordinate nationally, and two opinions have begun to separate very clearly in the national movement. The first opinion: wishfully believing that the Axis powers can be reconciled, advocates a neutral policy towards Japan. The conscious leader of this opinion is Subhas Bose, the former president of the National Congress, who escaped from the British prison and lives in Germany, often giving broadcast speeches to a large number of supporters in India, especially in Bengal. The other aspect of public opinion tends to the proposition that unity is above all else, believing that only on the basis of unity can the people be mobilized quickly to resist the Axis powers' attempt to repeat the history of France and China in India. This opinion is led by the smaller but highly efficient Indian Communist Party.</p>

<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 21st (Haitong News Agency): This afternoon's German military communiqué stated that the Southern Front of the Eastern European Soviet Army launched several fierce counterattacks, all of which were repelled, and suffered heavy losses. In the past two days, the Soviets lost 52 armored vehicles. A certain tank division of our army destroyed 24 enemy armored vehicles. Elite German Air Force units and Romanian fighter planes scattered concentrated Soviet troops and attacked enemy supply convoys. The German troops inside Stalingrad bravely resisted the approaching enemy forces and repelled them. There were local battles in the central part of Eastern Europe and south of Lake Ilmen. Commando teams repeatedly established meritorious service. Fierce fighting is still occurring south of Lake Ladoga, with 27 Soviet armored vehicles destroyed. In the ten days from the 11th to the 20th of this month, our army destroyed and captured a total of 804 Soviet tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Allied News Agency): Officials here stated last night that after fierce fighting on Tuesday, the German army and other Axis forces on the Eastern Front, from Lake Ladoga in the north to the Caucasus in the south, smashed the Soviet army's attempt to invade the Axis forces' lines. The Soviet offensive south of Lake Ladoga slightly invaded the German forces' positions after heavy losses, but the German forces resisted resolutely, and the Soviet attack finally collapsed. In the Lake Ilmen area to the south, the German army surrounded and annihilated a Soviet unit. A Soviet tank unit in the middle of the Don River was defeated by the German army, with 10 Soviet tanks destroyed. Fierce fighting in the area is still in progress. In the Stalingrad area, the Soviet army once again launched a fierce attack on the German defensive forces, which failed. The Soviet army's attempt to suppress the German army was smashed, and it suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources. On the Caucasus front, the Soviet army broke through the Axis forces' positions in the western part of the front, but its connection with the main Soviet forces has been cut off by the German and Romanian armies. The Soviet army in this area has also lost several inhabited areas. The Soviet offensive in the North Caucasus and the southern Don River has also been repelled.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency): London dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons that if bombing Rome is conducive to the victory of the war, Britain will not hesitate to do so. Since Italy has bombed London, we also have full right to bomb Rome. Several of the planes that bombed London yesterday were Italian planes.

<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Allied News Agency): According to news from the capital of Chile, at 3:40 PM Chilean time yesterday (5:45 AM Shanghai Daylight Saving Time today), Japan, Germany, and Italy received notification from Chile of its decision to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. This decision was notified by the Chilean Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Gajardo to the German and Italian ambassadors and the Japanese minister, and it was stated that the Chilean envoys stationed in Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome had notified the Axis governments separately. At the same time, the Chilean government also notified other American governments of the severance of relations with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency): Chilean President Ríos gave a half-hour broadcast speech today, implying that Chile's severance of relations with the Axis powers was due to oppression, and said, "I hope that the historical, political, economic, and cultural ties between us will not be affected by temporary measures." He concluded by saying, "Chile is still a country that loves freedom and abides by the law. People with different opinions will not suffer any sacrifice, and the law will protect everyone equally." Yesterday, before discussing international issues, Ríos talked about domestic and foreign difficulties. Chile will do its best to uphold the principles of Pan-American understanding, but there are still dissatisfied countries in the Americas. In order to fulfill our moral obligations, we cannot turn a deaf ear and take measures to sever relations.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency): Argentine President Castillo declared that Chile's severance of relations with the Axis countries has not affected Argentina's neutral attitude. Argentina has not changed its attitude.</p>
<p>Berlin Expresses Regret</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency): Berlin's reaction to Chile's severance of relations with the Axis powers was only "regret," especially towards Chile. Chile's decision is of little importance in Germany's strategic considerations. Berlin believes that there is no reason to sever diplomatic relations between Chile and the Axis powers. There is no fundamental conflict between Germany and Chile, whether politically or otherwise. Chile has maintained neutrality towards Germany in the past, and Germany has respected the status of Chile and other neutral countries. Because there is not only considerable economic connection between the two countries, but also close cultural and spiritual relations, the Chilean government's move to sever relations with the Axis powers this time is contrary to the interests of the Chilean people.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Absolute Prohibition of Wasting Gas and Electricity; Strict Implementation of Restrictions Starting This Year; Supply Stopped for Those Exceeding the Allotment <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company, in view of the large increase in gas consumption since the expansion of the war, has decided to adopt stricter new measures starting this month. If the consumption of users exceeds the officially allocated amount for two consecutive months, the supply will be cut off immediately.</p>
<p>Maximum Gas Consumption</p>
<p>According to the new measures, the maximum consumption is the amount of consumption in the month with the highest consumption from May to September last year, plus 10%. If the user's consumption exceeds this amount, the excess part will be charged at five times the normal price. If the excess amount is twice the normal amount, the excess amount will be charged at ten times the normal price. If the user continues to exceed the allocated amount for two months, the gas company will cut off the gas supply.</p>
<p>Electricity Saving Measures</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department has recently followed the regulations stipulated by the French Consulate General to implement new restrictions on electricity consumption. Therefore, inspectors are dispatched every night from various districts and neighborhoods to investigate and ensure the implementation of the electricity saving campaign with excellent results. The electricity saving measures stipulated by the French Consulate General are scheduled to be implemented from January 1 this year. The newly allowed electricity consumption is 85% of the amount stipulated in October last year. In other words, every store and household should save at least 15% of electricity this year. Store and shop window lights must be turned off from 8:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning. Stores that cannot operate due to the extinguishing of store lights will automatically close. If they are not affected by the extinguishing of store lights, they can continue to operate without a doubt. The degree of internal lights in stores and indoor lights in each household should be reduced. Those who arbitrarily waste electricity or do not comply with the regulations will be punished. In serious cases, the electricity supply will be stopped. The police department is paying close attention to this matter, strictly prohibiting violations of the rules, and determined to implement the purpose of saving electricity.</p>
<p>Power Distribution System to Be Changed</p>
<p>This newspaper in Shanghai of the Allied Press learned last night that the National Government has now joined the Greater East Asia War, and the amount of electricity required by various industries has increased. In order to cope with this need, the Central China Water and Electricity Company will soon revise the current power distribution system, which is aimed at economizing, and change it to a system based on prioritized distribution of power. In the future, electricity will be given priority to enterprises engaged in wartime and important food production, and the power allocated to businesses deemed non-essential will be greatly reduced. After the company has discussed with the office of the Japanese Embassy in this city, it will announce the details.</p>

<p>Since the expansion of the war, the number of steamships has decreased, making them difficult to allocate. To remedy this, the authorities have decided to actively reorganize junk shipping as a substitute and to facilitate freight transportation. It is reported that, regarding this plan, a Sino-Japanese joint venture operating organization will be established for control purposes. The details and organization of this operating organization are still under consideration, but it is known that it will be jointly organized by important government figures, powerful Chinese businessmen, and Japanese-Chinese shipping companies. The capital is set at 300 million yuan. After the establishment of the organization, it will mobilize all junks in Central China to strengthen the transportation of materials to various places. Currently, the Central China Junk Association is piloting junk transportation between Shanghai and Qingdao with good results. In addition, the East Asia Shipping Company is also preparing to use junks to operate in the Yangtze River and southern regions as a test for future regular navigation. Once the Sino-Japanese joint venture operating organization is established, everything can be presented in a controlled state.</p>

<p>Registration of Deeds in the Concession has been designated by the Japanese military department to be handled by commercial firms, and has been notified to apply for the release of enemy property disposal before February 9th of this year, otherwise, it will be treated as enemy property. Recently, as the deadline is approaching, the Real Estate Industry Association of this city, for the convenience of consulting with colleagues, if there are any unclear procedures, can inquire with the Association's Deed Section for detailed information to ensure the safety of property rights.</p>
<p>Deadline for Changing Land Registers</p>
<p>The authorities handle applications for the release of enemy property in the name of permitting the exchange of Japanese registration deeds, and after issuing the title deed, it is allowed to end on February 10th. It is heard that the title deed or land deed after the release of enemy management can be used as loan collateral. As for the genuine enemy title deed or joint-stock company, some of the shares belong to enemy nationals, and some belong to Chinese and neutral nationals. The authorities will also screen them. The screening period will be after the completion of the release of enemy property in the name of non-enemy nationals.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Council decided to prohibit the roadside stalls, it is dealing with the hawkers on Nanjing Road, Fourth Road, Zhejiang Road, Shandong Road and other places, and said that if they are found again in the future, their municipal certificates will be confiscated and they will be expelled from the country. At the same time, it is also learned that the police authorities will also prohibit the sheds and stalls set up on the empty land borrowed from the factory in the west, because this kind of sheds and stalls not only obstruct traffic and municipal appearance, but also have sanitation problems. Therefore, the responsible authorities have ordered the Baojia Association to forward orders to the factories to demolish all of them before the end of this month. If there are any resisters, they will report to the competent authorities at any time and impose severe punishments.</p>

<p>The Shanghai cigarette and daily necessities market, which was voluntarily closed by the industry association since last winter, originally planned to officially reopen last Monday. At the same time, the admission passes for registered colleagues have also been issued and 18 market supervisors have been appointed. However, the prices of cigarettes and daily necessities have been rising sharply recently, and there is deep concern that once the market resumes, speculators will still mix in and manipulate market prices, leading to punishment by the authorities. Therefore, it has been voluntarily decided to postpone the reopening and post a notice stating that the industry association will not be responsible for any accidents that occur in off-site transactions by colleagues before the market reopens.</p>

<p>A Dongmeng News Agency report from this city states that the newly appointed German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, is currently staying at the International Hotel. After completing preparations, he will go to Tokyo to take office. Yesterday, the Ambassador spoke to a Dongmeng News Agency reporter about the economic agreements concluded by Japan with Germany and Italy, saying that the agreements are proof that the foundations of the Axis Pact concluded by the three countries are working smoothly. The economic agreements are of great significance for completing the war efforts of the three Axis countries. He was very pleased to hear that Japan and Germany signed a new agreement on economic cooperation at the headquarters of the German head of state, and that Japan and Italy also concluded a similar agreement in Rome. This agreement is successful and important for the countries concerned, especially Japan, Germany, and Italy. It will use all industrial and economic resources of Japan and the Axis countries to ensure the victorious conclusion of this war. After arriving in Japan to take office, he will do his best to enable close cooperation between Japan and Germany, so as to seek the complete victory of the war as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Japanese Information Bureau announced the bulletin of the exchange of settlement documents between the Japanese and French governments, which was welcomed by the financial circles in this city, and it is expected that the trade relations between Central China and French Vietnam will increase. Since the outbreak of the current war, the commercial relations between Central China and the United Kingdom and the United States have been blocked, and it has had to rely on various regions in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, for trade. However, there are many obstacles in terms of settlement accounts. Now that Japan and France have agreed to use the Japanese yen as the basis for Vietnam's settlement with other regions of East Asia, the financial circles expect that there will be no more difficulties in the future, and have opened the way for Central China to trade more actively with various regions in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam will increase its rice exports to Central China. If Vietnam's exports exceed its imports from Japan, the new settlement method will offset it with Central China's exports to Vietnam. If Central China has a trade surplus with Vietnam due to the import of rice, Japan or other regions in East Asia can also increase their exports to Vietnam to offset it.</p>

<p>Last night's news, according to observers in this city, said that the registered cotton cloth and cotton yarn inventory in Shanghai totals about 700,000 bales, which is more than enough to meet the needs of Central China for the next ten to fifteen years. This huge amount of cotton goods will enable Shanghai to maintain its reputation as a major economic center and help stabilize the economy of Central China, putting Shanghai in an advantageous position to exchange agricultural products with the interior. It is found that the total amount of cotton cloth and cotton yarn registered by the authorities in this city since December 10 last year is 700,000 bales (officially estimated at 350,000 to 450,000 bales), of which 200,000 bales were registered with the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, 400,000 bales were registered with the Municipal Council and the French Public Works Bureau, and 100,000 bales were held by yarn factories and unregistered.</p>

<p>When the European War broke out in the autumn of 1939, Axis ships sailing in the Far East sailed to various ports in China, Japan, and Manchuria. Afterwards, Japan, with the expansion of the war and the increase in the demand for ships, organized the Imperial Shipping Company to be responsible for chartering Axis ships in various regions and achieved considerable success. However, the ships in various parts of Central China were not included in the charter. Recently, the Japanese side, with a greater need for ships than before, plans to have the Imperial Shipping Company come forward again to charter the Conte Verde and other ships anchored in Shanghai and other places from the Axis countries. The charter negotiations are underway.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Way to Preserve Wealth (1) <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Nie Yuntai</p>
<p>The author of this article, Mr. Nie Yuntai, is a man of high age and virtue, who is happy to do good. In recent years, he has studied Buddhism intensively, and his compassion has increased. He lives a simple life, eating simple food and dressing plainly, and uses the surplus to donate to society, taking from society and using it for society. He is able to gather and scatter, and actively do good. It is heard that Mr. Nie's family has prospered for seven generations, which is enough to see that accumulating virtue is not accidental. Even if he does not accumulate money for his descendants, his descendants can continue his aspirations and stand out, which is enough to give our outlook on life a new inspiration. The following article fully expounds the principles of "accumulating money" and "doing good", citing facts that are vivid and lifelike. Every word and sentence is written from the experience and taste. I hope that readers will pay more attention, it is fortunate.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to get rich. It is most difficult to preserve wealth. I have lived in Shanghai for more than 50 years and have seen many people get rich. After getting rich, some fail in less than five or ten years; some fail in twenty or thirty years; and some fail completely in forty or fifty years. I remember that most of the wealthy people who interacted with my late father, whether officials or businessmen, were prominent for a while, but now most of them have withered, their families have declined, some of their children have squandered everything, engaged in prostitution and gambling and not doing their proper business, and some have disappeared without a trace of their children and grandchildren. Counting on your fingers, among the wealthy people of forty or fifty years, it is rare to find one or two families whose family affairs have not completely failed and whose children can study, engage in proper business, and make progress. This is not unique to Shanghai. The same is true in my hometown of Hunan. In the Guangxu era, there were six or seven families of wealthy people who were conferred titles, twenty or thirty governors and governors-general, and fifty or sixty generals. Now, most of them have declined. Among them, there are many civil officials, with relatively little property, and their descendants are better. As far as I know: such as the Zeng, Zuo, Peng, and Li families. The one with the least money, the descendants are relatively more able to study and serve the society with academics. The great-grandchildren of Zeng Wenzheng have six or seven graduates from domestic and foreign universities, and three are university professors. Several great-grandchildren of Zuo Wenxiang are also specialized in science, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Li Yongyi have university professors, and the great-grandchildren are mostly university graduates. The descendants of Peng Gangzhi had an official in Shanghai ten years ago. Probably, the money at that time came from the right path, and there was no intention of accumulating money for their descendants, so their descendants were relatively virtuous and talented. The remaining ten or so civil officials with relatively more money, most of their descendants are now in decline. Dozens of military officers were all richer than civil officials at that time, with 100,000 or 200,000 (most of them made their fortunes by pacifying wars and continuing to command troops, and they could fill vacancies). There were only three or four with five or six hundred thousand, nearly one million. Such as Guo, Xi, and Yang, etc., all returned from military affairs in Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Guizhou. When Jinling was recovered, Wenzheng urgently dismissed the Xiang Army because of its twilight atmosphere. The Huai Army was used to suppress the Nian rebels, so very few of the old Xiang Army generals were rich). Most of the descendants of each family have also declined, and it is rare to hear of those who can study and make progress. My family and the major families of the Zhongxing, Xiang or Huai, are mostly related, so we know a little about the rise and fall of each family. As for the major families of civil and military officials in Anhui, who were richer than the Xiang Army, they are now all withered and unbearable to look back on. In just a few decades, only three generations have passed down, and they are all like fleeting clouds. However, a few families who were unwilling to get rich and did not accumulate money for their descendants have many excellent descendants. The smartest one was Zeng Wenzheng, who had the highest position and the greatest power. He was in office for 20 years, and when he died, he only had 20,000 taels of silver. Except for the old house in the countryside, he did not build a mansion in the province, and did not buy an acre of land. He created the Lianghuai salt ticket, priced it extremely favorably, and the interest was very high (the ticket price was 200 taels, and later it sold for 20,000 taels, with an annual rental income of 3,000 or 4,000 taels. At that time, a family with a salt ticket was called a wealthy family). The public specifically discussed that the Zeng family was not allowed to inherit it. Many years after the public passed away, none of the descendants had a salt ticket. If it were to be registered under some other name, it would be extremely easy to receive one or two hundred tickets. Moreover, it is in accordance with the regulations, and it does not violate the law on the surface. However, taking advantage of the power and position to engage in private affairs, the villain thinks it is harmless, but the gentleman does not do it. My mother knew the details of this matter at that time, and few outsiders knew about it. As the Doctrine of the Mean says: "What the superior man cannot attain is just this: what is not to be seen in what he does." This is called consistency between appearance and reality, which is the foundation of Chinese political science. Without this foundation, all political roads will not work. Modern political scientists must pay attention.</p>

<p>Since last year, the establishment of insurance companies in this city has been like bamboo shoots after a rain, totaling more than 80 companies. However, most of them have unsound internal mechanisms, and the total amount of capital is only 60 to 70 million yuan. Each company ranges from several hundred thousand yuan to several million yuan, with an average of less than one million yuan per company. Moreover, they compete with each other for business, and the premiums for water insurance, fire insurance, and life insurance are all inconsistent. As for the Japanese insurance companies in Shanghai, there are a total of 14 companies. It is now learned that Japanese insurance companies, in order to unify insurance operations, plan to inform the Chinese insurance industry association and the insurance company supervision bureau newly established at the end of last year to strictly control them and strictly set insurance rates.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market fluctuated, and investment and absorption were still strong, but those who chose to believe in it still raised some, while some stocks were forced to fall. The momentum is shrinking day by day, and the future continues to show a swirling image. According to the public's hearts, which are turning hazy, the Commercial Press in the cultural industry has no supply and rises to 470 yuan, up another 5 yuan. China and the World continue to see declines, the former retreated to around 180 yuan, down 2.5 yuan, and the latter was between 115 yuan and 10 yuan, down 1.5 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the public bond market initially showed signs of excitement, and market prices rose slowly. Later, due to continued pressure from sellers, it trended downward again, fluctuating without settling. People's hearts were confused. According to the current environment, it seemed that it should turn slightly higher, but it was restricted by the financial situation, making it unable to struggle. Yesterday, the Class C initial market was as high as 2.2 yuan, showing signs of rising. Then, pressure came again, and the price was again seen at 1.3 yuan, and finally at 1.56 yuan. Class E was 0.45 yuan, Class A was 1.4 yuan, and the rest were out of the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the interest rate of the Qianye Guild was still 1.7 cents and had not changed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, military tickets were flatter, with a peer-to-peer trading price of 5.5535 yuan, and the buying and selling prices for money shops and small money houses were 5.55 yuan and 6 yuan, also flat. Operators of the United Banknotes sold for 3.78 yuan and bought in for 3.73 yuan, up 3 cents.</p>

<p>Woolen cloth is difficult to obtain due to high raw material prices, and the cost is high and production is low due to electricity restrictions. The market is increasing day by day, gradually exceeding the price limit. Therefore, the industry discussed and requested the authorities to raise the previous price limit by 30%. It is heard that they have tentatively agreed to add 15%, and it is still under negotiation.</p>

<p>The daily necessities market was voluntarily closed by the industry association since last winter, and it was originally planned to officially reopen last Monday. However, since the prices of daily necessities have been rising sharply, the industry association authorities are deeply concerned that once the market resumes, market prices will still be easily manipulated. Therefore, it has voluntarily decided to postpone the reopening and posted a notice outside the industry association yesterday, stating that the industry association authorities will not be responsible for off-site transactions by colleagues before the reopening. The prices of daily necessities yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>The actual price of soap is still trending upward. Because of the lack of raw materials and the suspension of distribution, although miscellaneous brands are flooding the market, raw materials are very difficult to obtain, so production has also decreased, and the selling price is high. Yesterday, the market price of Guben soap continued to rise to 760 yuan per box, Baixiangmao soap 700 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap 640 yuan, and Scissor soap 730 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Cigarette Tax Levied Based on Value: Factory Prices Approaching Market Prices <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The rise in cigarette prices has stabilized, as the widely rumored tax increase issue has been announced by the authorities. The original plan to levy both the consolidated cigarette tax and the temporary special tax has been changed, with the temporary special tax being abolished and replaced by a value-based tax, still divided into five grades. Subsequently, the factory wholesale prices are quite similar to the current retail prices, which has somewhat calmed the public's fears, and buying and selling are becoming balanced. The prices are as follows: British American Tobacco's "Great Britain" brand is 11,300 yuan, "Old Knife" brand is 9,000 yuan, "Pinhai" brand is 7,500 yuan, "Wuhua" brand is 6,500 yuan, "Little Fairy" brand is 8,000 yuan, Japanese Tobacco's "Golden Gun" brand is 3,050 yuan, "Golden Building" is 3,800 yuan, "Red Rose" is 2,700 yuan, "Quanlu" brand is 3,450 yuan, "Nianzhi" is 3,100 yuan, "Zhinan" brand is 2,900 yuan, National Tobacco's "Pyramid" brand is 6,400 yuan, "Beautiful" brand is 5,700 yuan, "Golden Mouse" brand is 4,000 yuan, and "White Golden Dragon" is 4,100 yuan. High-quality goods, whether canned or boxed, are mostly reliant on foreign imports. With the lack of raw materials for local production, factories have stopped production for a long time, relying entirely on existing stock to meet demand. Therefore, those who have stock are bound to hoard and demand high prices, making it difficult for prices to fall. For example, 50-stick cigars cost 50,000 yuan, "Great South Gate" is 40,000 yuan, "3-5" brand is 41,000 yuan, "Big Cannon Platform" is 23,000 yuan, and "Small Cannon Platform" is 14,000 yuan, all per 10,000 sticks. However, prices have fallen considerably from their peaks.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Rising Star - Aluminum <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Liming</p>
<p>"It's white and somewhat shiny, definitely not made of copper or iron, but it's not tinplate either. It's not as soft as tinplate!"</p>
<p>"It's a bit like the tin pots we use at home for soup!"</p>
<p>The material for modern transportation tools that shorten space, and war weapons that blast enemy fortifications - airplanes, is mainly made of this stuff.</p>
<p>This is not surprising. It is difficult for us to have a lasting impression of this metal in our minds. It is neither copper nor iron, nor aluminum or zinc (tinplate is made of zinc), it is white with a crystalline shine, but very light, so it is used to make the outer shell and parts of airplanes. This is an advantage that none of the metals we know has. Everyone knows that metal materials are always heavy and bulky.</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's environment where "nothing is more urgent than air defense," this light and shiny metal has become the most popular thing. Its name is - "Aluminum."</p>
<p>In fact, aluminum's formal birth and discovery by humans was only about forty years ago. However, it was "born at the right time," fitting the needs of the modern aviation industry. In just a few decades, it has become the most popular metal, while copper and iron, which were discovered and used by ancient humans long ago, have faded into obscurity. Therefore, we often say: "Aluminum is the rising star among metals."</p>
<p>Among the various metals that humans can use, aluminum is one of the latest to be discovered. But in reality, aluminum is not a rare thing. According to the results of actual surveys and research, among the various metals contained in the 60-kilometer-thick crust, aluminum has the largest reserves. If the reserves of copper are taken as 1, then nickel is 10, magnesium is 1200, iron is 2200, and aluminum is 4000, which shows its abundance.</p>
<p>The reason why aluminum could not appear earlier is mostly due to the difficulties in manufacturing. Because aluminum's chemical properties are very active, its oxides cannot be reduced by ordinary carbon. So, the first production of elemental aluminum was achieved by the reaction of metallic potassium with aluminum chloride. Metallic potassium itself is a very expensive chemical, and the aluminum produced was sold at a higher price of over 160 gold yuan per pound. Later, although there were some improvements in manufacturing methods, it still could not be used as a common and practical material.</p>
<p>In 1886, the American Hall first experimented with producing aluminum by electrolysis. It was not until 1890 that it achieved complete success. Due to the simplicity and low cost of the electrolysis method, the application of aluminum has increased day by day. In recent years, it has shown a trend of surpassing copper and iron. Whether in transportation, manufacturing, national defense, or other industrial sectors, aluminum is an indispensable and important raw material.</p>
<p>The specific gravity of aluminum is about 2.7. In commerce, the purity of aluminum is usually from 98% to 99.5%. The remaining impurities are mostly copper, iron, and sand. As a result of advances in metallurgy in recent years, the purest aluminum can reach 99.998%.</p>
<p>The main uses of pure aluminum are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Used in the steelmaking industry - Adding aluminum to copper can remove residual gases in the steel to obtain solid steel ingots. Also, aluminum increases the fluidity of molten steel, so aluminum can be used to obtain more precise and complex steel castings.</p>
<p>(2) Used in welding engineering - Aluminum has a strong affinity for oxygen. If aluminum powder and oxidizing agents (such as iron oxide, potassium chlorate, etc.) are evenly mixed, they can undergo oxidation and combustion, with a combustion temperature reaching 5400 degrees, far above the melting point of steel. So, using aluminum to weld steel has a multiplier effect. A certain type of newly made British incendiary bomb is made of aluminum and iron oxide. It burns at extremely high temperatures, and ordinary water hoses and chemical foam fire extinguishers cannot put it out.</p>
<p>(3) Pure aluminum is extremely difficult to combine with air; in chemical terms, it has strong "corrosion resistance." So, aluminum is often used to make better daily utensils and scientific instruments.</p>
<p>(4) Used in the electrical industry - Aluminum's conductivity is quite high, about 60% of that of copper, which is much better than common metals such as iron, zinc, and nickel. Therefore, aluminum wires are often used for the transmission of high-voltage electricity. Moreover, if a steel wire is inserted into the center of an aluminum woven strand, the tensile strength of the resulting "steel-core aluminum strand" can be several times greater than that of ordinary copper wire.</p>
<p>Because aluminum has high corrosion resistance, it is not easily corroded even in seawater, which is much better than other metals. This is quite important in the shipbuilding industry. When aluminum is exposed to air, it is easily oxidized by the oxygen in the air to form a layer of oxide film on the surface. The structure of this oxide film is very dense, which can protect the inner layer and prevent it from continuing to be oxidized. This is indeed a piece of luck for aluminum itself, because if oxidation could continue to the inside, then aluminum would become a useless thing in industry, so how could it be so important now?</p>
<p>In addition to the advantages mentioned above, there is another feature that everyone knows, that is, aluminum is the lightest metal. This makes it an important raw material in the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>But in fact, the problem is not so simple. Pure aluminum has a big disadvantage: it is not hard. Airplanes must be prepared to withstand bullets fired by the enemy at any time, and the outer shell cannot be made of tofu. In this regard, steel is the most suitable, but unfortunately, it is too heavy, and airplanes cannot "afford" it. So, the aircraft industry still wants to use this light metal aluminum, but if this soft aluminum cannot be hardened, aluminum will also be discarded like steel.</p>
<p>This difficulty was quickly resolved, that is, by combining aluminum with other appropriate metals and specifying appropriate components to form an "alloy," which can become an ideal metal that is light, hard, and durable. This is the so-called "aluminum alloy." (Donations to Relief Fund)</p>

<p>Causes Consequences</p>
<h3 id="e53">Thoughts on the Play "Rainbow Garment Melody" <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Mang Ci</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Ke introduced himself in the special issue: "Rainbow Garment Melody is a pretty good thriller." What is a thriller! According to Mr. Yao's explanation, it does not pay attention to characterization, but focuses purely on "novel plot and tight staging."</p>
<p>Whether this definition of a thriller is valid is left aside; based on my impression after watching it, I think it is very vulgar, at best, just a very inferior American movie. People who are used to watching movies can imagine it with their eyes closed, so where is the "novelty"? A detective catching a robber, this is the G-man type; a bandit's den meets a beauty, this is the boy-meets-girl formula; and finally, plus a happy ending: in short, this is a full of Yankee gimmicks. It can be called a gimmick, but to boast about it as "pretty good," then I have to admire Mr. Yao's boldness.</p>
<p>We might as well quote a few of the most wonderful lines here:</p>
<p>Abao: Wearing pajamas to meet guests is good, but I'm afraid the young men who haven't married will feel a little, you know.</p>
<p>Hongying: How do you know he's not married?</p>
<p>Abao: If he was married, he would definitely not come so early tomorrow morning; he can't get up...</p>
<p>Enough! These few lines are enough to make people feel a little, you know.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Ke is constantly clarifying that his thriller cannot be judged by "consciousness," but isn't the above the expression of "rascal consciousness"? It must be known that the word consciousness is not just about shouting two sentences "You are a bright girl," but is revealed in the author's words, and cannot be covered up no matter how hard you try. Although Mr. Yao peddles "thriller"... and that set of new terms from America, he should at least be responsible for audience education. If we say that fresh forms should be introduced, then are Vaudeville (boring dance dramas) and burlesque (thigh dances) in America also acceptable?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if we affirm that the path Mr. Yao is taking is correct, there is still a problem here: how should "rationalization" be discussed in the script? Mr. Yao said: "... do not demand absolute truthfulness and rationalization of the plot, as long as it is not too absurd and unreasonable." This is tantamount to saying nothing. Because he has not given a clear definition of rationalization.</p>
<p>My opinion is the opposite; if it is a good work, the plot can be unreasonable. Faust, do we really believe that he would deal with the devil? The family in "Swiss Family Robinson," do we really believe that they would suffer losses from the old king? The advantage of "artistic exaggeration" is to use unreal events to arouse a deeper understanding of reality. However, we can only say that the unrealism of "Rainbow Garment Melody" is childish!</p>
<p>Mr. Yao pays close attention to the small Guan programs (such as "Butterfly Returns to Its Original State" and "Volunteer Drama," how he can think of it!), but the entire play structure is extremely far-fetched, with contradictions everywhere. As soon as Sun Yuting comes up, he has a falling out with Hongying. In principle, he would never let go of the fat meat that he has already obtained lightly, but Hongying lies that Ling Yun is her fiancé, and Sun Yuting walks away and ignores it. After walking away, he sends people to monitor and inquire... As the leader of a private smuggler, how can he be as naive as a child? Ling Yun's attitude is also strangely strange. At first, he is unwilling to be the fiancé. Later, Hongying tells him that the news has spread, but he agrees. The extent to which Hongying is afraid of Sun Yuting is also elusive... In short, the relationship between Sun Yuting, Hongying, and Ling Yun is completely a messy account that cannot be cleared.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Qiao Qi's portrayal of Ling Yun, who is a crude character, is commendable. The rest is not worth talking about. The most problematic is Gong Jiabao and Zhou Jing, who plays Abao. Abao is a female servant, but Zhou Jing has permed hair and lipstick, and from a distance, she is more beautiful than the protagonist Bai Hong. Gong Jiabao's body is like a rattle drum, constantly swaying while talking.</p>
<p>There are three interludes, but my "heart" is not used to "sitting in a sofa chair," so I really can't hear the good in them.</p>
<p>Finally, I do not particularly agree with Mr. Yao's use of Shaw's self-proclaimed bragging title. Shaw has his works to guarantee it; those who use Shaw as a talisman should also reflect on themselves: whether they have works worth bragging about like Shaw.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Greatest Teacher of All Time <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>In such matters, about ten times, on one occasion, he was stubborn and would not listen to advice. In almost half of these exceptions, he later regretted not having listened to her advice. Years later, whenever he had trouble with a student, he often recalled these events and his heart would soften; the child would be there waiting to hear his punishment, but she would tell him that all was well. But he never guessed that Chips was remembering something that had happened long before he was born; he never guessed that Chips was thinking: Little rascal, I can't think of any reason to let him go, but I'm sure she can!</p>
<p>But she did not always ask for forgiveness. Rarely, when Chips was inclined to pardon, she would advocate for a severe punishment. "I don't like his looks, Chips, he's too self-confident. If he's going to cause trouble, I'll be sure to give him trouble."</p>
<p>Buried deep in the past were many small events that had once been critical issues, once intense debates, anecdotes that were interesting to remember. When the last trace of emotion has disappeared from human memory, does any emotion really matter? If it does matter, then how many emotions are firmly attached to him, refusing to let go before they dissipate! He must be polite to them, he must cherish them before they sleep forever. For example, the resignation of Alger! That was a strange thing. There was also the incident about the rat; Old Ogilvie put it in the organ loft while he was conducting the choir rehearsal. Ogilvie died, and Dunster drowned in Jutland; perhaps most of the people who saw or heard the incident have already forgotten it. This incident, and many others, seemed to have happened centuries ago. He suddenly saw in his imagination millions of children, teachers generation after generation since the Elizabethan era; the history of Brookfield could be considered long, but no basic records were left behind.

<p>— Guan</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers, in the current Shanghai occupational circle, are in fact a profession that can still make a living. However, they run all day long, in heat and cold, and only get enough to eat. Their lives are not guaranteed, and they deserve sympathy.</p>
<p>At a certain gathering, I heard the opinion of an elder. He said that the only way to guarantee the lives of rickshaw pullers is through saving. For example, currently, a rickshaw puller rents a rickshaw from the owner and has to pay a rental fee of two yuan per day. In this two yuan, the owner should be required to extract ten cents, and the rickshaw puller should also take out ten cents, put them together for savings. If calculated with interest on interest, after three years, there will be enough savings for a rickshaw, after five years, there will be enough for two rickshaws, and after ten years, the rickshaw puller will become a rickshaw owner, achieving "the rickshaw puller owns his own rickshaw," at which time his life will be guaranteed. This is a very concrete and reasonable method, and if rickshaw pullers can unite and implement it, it will not be difficult.</p>
<p>In fact, this method has already been implemented in many general institutions or organizations. That is, a certain percentage of the employees' salaries are deducted daily for savings, and the institution or organization subsidizes a portion, called co-savings. After a considerable period, the amount is indeed considerable. This kind of mutually beneficial labor-capital method should be actively promoted.</p>
