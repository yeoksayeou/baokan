<p>社評</p>
<h3>如何管制物價？</h3>
<p>前日於物價對策，有所闡發，有所獻護，茲更進而一談管理與統制物價中，當局，工商界與社會一般人士所應注意者若干要點如次：</p>
<p>首先，我們始終認定經濟問題是政治問題的一部分，政治基礎優良，機構健全，則經濟上的任何措施，自然輕而易舉。反之，就會費力多而成效少，所謂事倍功半，縱有良法美意，每難悉如預期。過去政府當局施行的各種統制，立法之初意，或者無一不佳，而推行結果，則適成流弊淵籔。爲什麽？就是因爲吃了政治不健全的虧。一般人對於政府辦事失效，輒歸咎於機構之不健全，但是，機構何以會不健全？則還應承認政治基礎不良所致。老實說，幾年來，我們老百姓只聽到許多漂亮的口號，動人的標語，政治上許多毛病，還是改革很少，目前許多無庸諱言的病態，不僅由於機構之不健全，大抵政治根本積重難返，已非一紙命令文吿所能盡革今日之頽風。所以想到今後物價實施全面的管制，更望上下協力，務須盡革過去政治上的病根。否則，實爲管制前途莫大的障礙。</p>
<p>因此，我們可以指出，管制物價雖是管物，但是管物必先管人，尤其是要先管管人的人。把管人的人管好，則一般的人可望管好，而後物也可望管好。談到物價問題，常常痛斥擾亂物價的奸商，而實際上所謂奸商，大概都是社會上比較有塲面有辦法的人，他們都是手眼通天。所以，奸商必須裁抑，而官吏經商尤須認眞嚴禁。政府本有公務員不得兼營商業的禁令，這種法令現在必須貫澈。政府應該淸查一下，若干官吏兼營着商業銀行或企業公司的董事長或董事經理，或若干商人作了官（尤其是金融上經濟上及統制工作上的官），對於這種官而商商而官的二重人格的人，應該限令他們辭官或者辭商，專幹一門而不能任其進退自如，左右逢源，政府能做到這一步，再對實際負責物價管制的各級人員加以嚴格的訓練與考查，則社會視聽必能爲之一新，物價的管制上必可收到重大的效果。</p>
<p>其次，關於執行管制物價的機構與人事方面，第一，是執行機構必須統一，因爲機構不統一，不但使工商各業，有莫知所從之苦，而且互相牽制，互相推諉，互相抵觸的現象，一定不能避免，工作效率，自然要受到阻礙了。要全面的管理物價問題，這是不可不深加注意的。第二，領導機關對於工，農，鑛各業，必須處處採用扶助的態度，一紙命令，是不能濟事的。如果輕於處罰，則使從事生產者有無所措手足之感，如何還能求生產之增加？特別如本報前幾天听指出的，中國是以中小生產佔優勢的國家，小生產的特點是散漫的是薄弱的，對症下藥，只有扶助其發展生產，在經濟上刺激其擴大生產的興趣，資助其擴大生產之能力，這就可以從積極方面以增加生產來解决物價問題。第三，辦理管制工作的人，必須人人拿出天良來，一要認眞，二要無例外。中國社會的通病，就是重情不重法，人人以不受法令拘束爲榮，而只期望別人之守法，尤其是有勢力的地方官員，與富豪劣紳，平常都在盡力求通融不守法中過日子，國家法令，每每小能貫澈，此輩人是罪魁禍首。今後必須痛切注意，破壞此種惡習。第四，執行機構方面，上級對於下級，要多盡責任，指導不厭周群，監督愈嚴愈佳，檢討愈勤愈好，下級機構如推行失當，或發生流弊，上級機構，不獨應負失察之責任，並且應負連帶責任。</p>
<p>管制物價，必須是全面的和澈底的，但是決不能只靠法令文吿，只靠當局的努力，必須全國人民一德一心合力以赴，始能奏效。這裏，第一要求「公開」，對上對下，必須澈頭澈尾，毫不隱瞞，毫不掩飾，事事顯露眞相，處處宣佈實况，這樣公開辦理，一可以消除藉秘密以舞弊的因素，二可以因爲把一切管制懲罰悉數向社會公開，漸漸養成社會制裁力量，人人以不守法爲恥。第三，是需要政府髙官大吏出而做人民守法的模範。我國社會傳統，重情不重理，徇情而枉法的「固有道德」，實在不能存在於今日，而必須以髙官大吏開始，一要講理，二要守法，廟堂上有了大義滅親的盛典，社會上就有破除情面的美事，易俗移風，共濟時艱，是今日刻不容緩之舉，不僅於物價問題爲然了。</p>

<h3>梅傑士埃爾勃區　協約軍向西撤退　軸心軍佔領該處南面山地　英軍尚未與德義主力接觸</h3>
<p>里斯本廿日同盟社電　關於北非方面戰事、柏林當局謂、羅美爾上將之非洲軍、正在的黎波利坦尼亞境內照預定計劃行動、協約軍司令部則承認軸心軍會於星期一日在杜發西南稍有進展、惟柏林方面　謂、梅傑士埃爾勃區協約軍已向西撤退、軸心軍陣機已向前推進、佔領該處南面山地、</p>
<p>羅馬二十日海通社電　　義軍司令部昨發表文告稱、費桑區雙方斥堠部隊接戰之結果、吾方得利、得意斥堠隊在突尼西亞戰綫之進攻甚有所獲、是日德義空軍協助地面戰事與空製敵軍陣地、殊爲活躍、軸心國飛機計擊落敵機九架、高射砲隊則擊落四引擎之敵機一架、波那被吾機轟炸、阿爾及利亞海岸外敵護航隊遭　機所襲、擊沉中型汽　　艘、並有三船中彈起火、敵機一再空襲的黎波利、房屋受有若干損害、里比亞居民略有死傷、恩浦杜格爾港遭敵機所襲、軍事目標未被中彈、惟若干房屋受有損害、居民二人殞命、九人受傷、高射砲火擊落敵機一架、</p>
<p>柏林二十日海通社電　里比亞雖有激戰、然蒙特高茂萊將軍尚未能與德義坦克軍隊主力交戰、僅與其堅強之後衛部隊發生接觸而已、故羅美爾上將仍可將其主力任意調至預定之地點隨時發動反攻、英第八軍之實力現約有坦克軍四師團、步兵五至六師團、其左翼繼續推進、謀奪取軸心軍南翼之地位、然後與突尼西亞南部　叛軍連合、北進抵迦勃海峽、切斷突尼西亞與的黎波利間之軸心軍、此項計劃實現之希望、實殊薄弱、</p>
<h3>斯達林格勒區戰況漸趨穩定　德孤軍仍死力堅守陣地　蘇軍迭次進攻均被擊退</h3>
<p>柏林二十日海通社電　昨夜接前綫來電稱、斯達林格勒區戰況漸趨平定、大隊蘇軍已自該處撤往頓河區、</p>
<p>柏林二十日海通社電　星期一東綫之防守戰仍在激烈　行中、　事之中心在南路及拉多加湖運南之地區、德羅聯軍在西高加索擊　蘇軍之進攻、敵軍在伊爾門湖東南之進攻、未能動搖德軍之防綫、拉多加湖區蘇軍再作猛攻、經重大犧牲後、始得突入德軍陣綫、星期一紅軍在伊爾門東南及拉多加湖迤南共損失坦克軍三十二輛、德國及同盟國空軍協助地面戰　、甚為出力、計擊落蘇機十六架、已方一無損失、</p>
<p>柏林二十日同盟社電　據此間官方昨夜宣布、蘇聯軍隊於本星期一大舉進攻之後、德軍正會同友軍堅强抵抗、蘇聯軍隊雖稍有進展、但所付代價甚大、計損失戰車百餘輛、飛機十八架、大砲八十尊及其他軍備甚多、蘇聯軍隊攻勢以高加索至頓河套及斯達林城一帶、最為猛烈、斯達林城方面德國孤軍死力堅守、僅有少數前哨業已撤退。紅軍迭次進攻、均被擊退、</p>
<p>紅軍將領調任新職</p>
<p>莫斯科二十日中央社電　蘇軍最高當局、頃調任北部方面軍司令官巨哥夫大將爲蘇維埃聯邦元帥、並任命巴羅諾夫大將爲此次新制定之砲兵元帥、復任命現伏朗尼茲方面指揮官瓦西列夫斯基大將爲軍團長、</p>

<h3>阿特里出席下院　報告北非戰況　軸心軍一時難加消滅</h3>
<p>邱吉爾未見出席引起各方揣測傳已赴美與羅斯福商北非問題</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十日海通社電　倫敦電訊、英國會昨召開聖誕節後之首次會議、下院中所提出之問題共有一六五則、均與戰具生產有關、開會時、副首相阿特里對戰局略事檢討、謂蘇軍已獲有偉大之成就、北非之協約軍決完全消滅軸心軍、但以地面遼闊、氣候特殊、敵流動部隊、仍難加以消滅、羅美爾之部下、雖未在埃爾阿吉拉被完全擊潰、然其所受損失、實至為重大、今德義坦克軍隊、力事避免與我軍接觸、何時能痛擊之、現尚未能預言、政府對艾森霍華將軍及第一軍長安特森、殊爲信任、而馬爾太島之抵抗、尤足令人欽佩、馬爾太始終為敵側面之刺、關於法屬北非局勢、英美間雖有意見不合、然情形並不若宣傳之嚴重、英政府深知美國與維布保持外交關係、實具有種種便利、英美擬進攻北非之計劃時、態度殊爲融洽、蓋英美僅有一個目標、即聯合法人、向軸心奮鬥是也、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十日海通社電　倫敦來電、昨日下院開會時、邱吉爾首相未見出席、遂又引起猜測、謂邱氏於月初以來、即逗留美京、一般預料、如邱吉爾與羅斯福談話、首先討論者、必爲北非問題、消息靈通方面認英美關於該一問題、勢必成立一種協定、故不久諒可有驚人消息發　、查北非局勢、係自一月初以來、始趨嚴重、故邱吉爾或係即於是時赴美、俾與羅斯福一談、亦未可知、</p>

<h3>英國必須放棄印度麼　（二）</h3>
<p>看到甘地耽溺於詭辯和自相矛盾，印度人中間很少有被激怒的。他們直覺地從他的一個意義之中猜出一個意　來，上層階級的印度人，幾乎全都像甘地一樣具有兩種人格，一方面，他們是實用主意者，他們的信念有生活中的具體事實作為根據，另一方面，他們又是神秘主義和浪漫主義者。</p>
<p>大多數的印度人承認這個事實，而且替甘地辯解的時候，說他是以兩種語言來說話的。第一種，是過去的言語，有着神秘主義的形而上的傳統術語，印度民衆瞭解這個另一種，是現代的政治現實主義的語言。兩種聲音都是必要的。</p>
<p>心情跟甘地極不相同的尼赫魯，在解釋這個現象的時候，對我說：「你必須把甘地的人格和作為民族領袖的甘地分開來看。」甘地是一個非常實際政治家，當他實行領導的時候，他很會像任何人一樣地委曲求全和討價還價。但他永遠不放棄說述自己的內心，率直的表現他的個性，表示他是世界的良心，表示他是一個道德家。這兩個角色混合起來　達印度　主義，就往往把外界弄糊塗，覺得後者仿佛是不可理解的胡言亂語了。</p>
<p>儘管我們覺得甘地的話有一些似乎很荒唐的，這並不能取銷他的民族領袖的地位。他是人，他是良心，他是多數印度人所信任的，盲目地追隨而服從着的偉大靈魂。雖然他的私人哲學常常給印度的政治思想以狂妄的影響，但他使出看家本領，計劃一個政治行動的時候，就顯得十分靈敏。他動員了國民大會工作委員會的領袖們，特別是尼赫魯，來提出後來被全印大會通過的措辭聰敏的議案，就能證明這一點。</p>
<p>因此，假如把甘地捉起來關進牢監，大部份的印度人一定會覺得精神上和他一起入獄了。毫無疑義，如果像克利浦斯爵士的聲明以及英政府其他人士所指出的那樣，英國無意於重開談判，那麼，英國也的確沒有路走。但英政府似乎並沒有預見到激起的反應　有目前那樣的規模。</p>
<p>要估計甘地，尼赫魯和其他領袖被捕所發生的影響，我們首先必須記得，他們是印度苦痛的象徵，這苦痛是將近兩個世紀的英國統治所累積起來的，是印度人為驅除這統治而鬥爭的二十年歷史所累積起來的。他們　此為口實，堅決要求立即成立自主政府，雖然聯合國家有着慘重的困難，而國民大會是承認同情聯合國家的。在上述的苦痛之外，現在又加上一個苦痛——示威遊行者對抗英政府絞殺不服從運動的企圖而激起的殺人和流血。</p>
<p>「印度的民族主義者像愛爾蘭人一樣，」最近爲了戰爭問題而和甘地決裂的國民大會領袖之一，拉雅哥伯拉查理（Rojago-Palachari）對我說「他們和英國人鬥爭到現在，還不能把他們已經擁有的東西和新的更惡劣的威脅之間，秤一秤輕重。」</p>
<p>初到印度的英美人士聽印度人說他們自己是「奴隸」，稍稍有點兒驚異，因為在許多方面他們比我們現在更來得自由。大體上，他們比半殖民地更自由。印度人享有着範圍很廣的結社自由，出版自由，和集會自由等等。他們有述說意見的絕對自由。特務　員並不威脅到個人的安全。戰爭尚未增加很多的經濟困難，迄今為止還沒有統　日常必須的食糧。</p>
<p>我在加爾各答，德里和孟買的街上，都看到共產黨召集的羣衆大會示威遊行，羣衆高呼革命的口號，痛斥英帝國主義，紅旗活躍地在微風中飄蕩，沒有人干涉。不久以前，共產黨人很多在獄中，但如今共產黨擁護戰爭，它也就成為合法的了。</p>
<p>在華德哈，在甘地和國民大會計劃推翻英國統治的所有集會中，從沒有人來企圖解散會場，甚至會場附近一個警察都沒有。用許多種文字出版的「哈里　報」，明顯地並不經過審查，把反叛的威脅　　了全國，華德哈的國民大會員們都安然無事。</p>
<p>當俺們微詢我的意見的時候，我大胆向一位國民大會會員說：「你們也許正鑄下最大的戰略錯誤，你們已經有了百分之七十五的自由，如今你們忽略了保衛這個百分之七十五的重要性，而集中力量以爭取其餘的百分之二十五。你們可能把兩者都損失掉的。」然而我所說的，很少有人注意到。</p>
<p>我們必須記得的第二點，是戰前和戰時的舊恨新仇，變成了病症，這病症表現在對英國的亟度懷疑上頭，不論多少邱吉爾式的雄辯，都不能祛除這懷疑。現在，印度人痛恨邱吉爾的理由之中，又增加了一條：在大西洋憲章之中，他特地把印度除外，這是對印度的侮辱。</p>
<p>在最後歸於失望的許多事件中，很多印度人現在舉出克里浦斯訪印的事情來，克利浦斯此行的結果，特別使印度自由主義者和親英的民族主義者傷心。親英的民族主義者們很久以來就把這信心寄託在工業身上，希望工黨能夠親善地在印度造成和平的變革，而在工業之中，克利浦斯是位傑出的人物。所以當他戲劇化地來到印度，在兩個星期之內，談判和印度人合作的條件，而這樣的談判是兩年餘以來印度總督一直規避着的，在這樣的時候，克利浦斯到達印度，全國都湧現着希望，之後，發現了他甚至並未能夠立即給印度以自治的地位，他算錯了，以為保證戰後獨立已經儘够了，殊不知日本的成就已經改變了局勢，印度人目前看戰後的局勢，就像轉世投胎以後的事情一樣的不確定了。</p>

<p>五項宗旨</p>
<p>故國民外交促進會亟當早日成立、而　政府國民共同協力外交之最高目的、本會乃根據此重大意義、冀欲喚起全國民衆、共同促進新外交途徑、宗旨共有五點、（一）自主更新、（二）促進和平、（三）排除英美惡勢力、（四）貫徹總理遺教、（五）維護僑胞、最後略述該會工作之大概、旋即由褚外交部長訓示稱、對該會之成立、表示異常贊助及愉快、認為該會使命重大、係使人民與政府能打成一片、一致合作、協力外交、最後希望該會在外交上有極大貢獻云、繼請重光大使致詞、略謂、滬上係中國人才之集中地、現成立國民外交促進會、意義至為更大、本人出對貴會表示敬意外、並對貴國之決心參戰、表示無限敬意、更祝貴會在外交上有幾大之貢獻與成功、後由意大利大使德總領事西班牙公使相機致詞、對國民外交促進會　　有加、均贊助、</p>
<p>張一鵬詞</p>

<h3>大餅油條業瀝陳苦衷　籲請恢復配粉　三千餘家店鋪藉以營業　一萬五千職工賴以生活</h3>

<p>、爲顧請工部局變通交換辦法、照常恢復配粉、以維生計事、昨呈該局文云、竊閱鈞局於三十一年二月三十一日公布、　變更麵粉配給辦法</p>

<p>公共租界某處於最近發生一驚人鋸竊案、茲將本報記者探悉詳情、分誌如下、</p>

<p>通州人江雲生、年二十四歲、向在公共租界某處充當出店、其同鄉人趙洪惠、年三十五歲、亦在該處充包車夫、迄今有年、平日頗受主任所信任、詎於本月九日、江雲生與趙洪惠頓起歹念、竟乘隙串同潛入內室竊盜其僱主款項金條、及貴重飾物等、共值國幣二十七萬元、携賊逃逸無踪、</p>

<h3>華股漲勢漸平定　但若干仍向上進展堅持不放</h3>
<p>昨華商股票市况、接連已有六天之鋒鋩、故漲勢漸平、轉呈徘徊之局面、然不免仍有買風遺留、若十股仍向上進展而見高、握有股票者亦稍有吐出、一部份略見向下、照走勢暫時續有迥旋可能、南洋烟草公司買風未息、再升至一百二十八元半、恐難進得、大中華火柴亦升元許、達三百二十六七元、百貨業最爲穩定、麗華公司三百四十元、有求少供、永安公司一百三十二元七五升七角半、新新一百四十二元、國貨公司七十六元半、均爲正午成交價、軋平、紡織業大生一廠四百二十元有買戶、三廠返留在三百六七十元、永安紗廠平疲在三百三十五元至四十元間、美亞新股交易頗旺、見三十一元半高價、榮豐染織雖堪維持、但仍難挽疲勢、在三十五六元問，三友實業成交價在一百五十元至五十五元間、新豐印染再跌至十八元、大中華織造升至十元關口、大光明十二元二五亦挺、宏姓仍八元半、文化業回跌，最爲顯著、中華書局最小一百八十二元半、小七元半、世界步降爲一百十四元、小三元半、商務獨平、仍爲四百六十五元、新藥業僅新亞藥廠二十五元、升二角半、餘如中法二十七元二五、信誼二百四十七元半、均見疲落、五洲六百六十元、民誼六十二元半、中西四百三十五元、均平、國華銀行成交價在一百七十五元至七十元間、公用業最爲呆定、閘北水電、六十五六元、華商電氣四十五六元、均爲進出價、其他各股亦轉平疲、成交頗旺、</p>
<h3>公債買氣　不以銀根而衰</h3>
<p>昨公債行市、忽有正式轉風、買賣雙方競爭結果、竟爲多方佔優勝、銀根雖緊、不因此而顧慮、可知銀根鬆者自鬆、緊者略緊、其原因大概仍爲環境關係居多、如丙種初做爲一元四角、旋即升至二元、繼以賣方猶圖掙扎、逞最後之壓迫、再回小至一元有奇、但不旋踵復又升至一元八九角、末後二元外有人要、竟無售主、形勢已有轉變、行市可抱樂觀、其他各種亦無不上升、甲種做一元四五角、乙種做一元左右、丁種做九元七八角、戊種做五十元零五六角、聞供貨者、因催還甚緊，大概亦爲一重大原因耳、</p>
<h3>軍票結款轉稀</h3>
<p>昨錢業公會拆息一角七分、未更、</p>
<p>日軍票已見回下、同業互做價遜爲五元五角五分三五厘、略降數釐乃結款已淸、小錢莊與銀號門市售出退爲五元五角六分、收進仍五分，聯銀券小二分、經營者售出三元七角半、收進三元七角云、</p>
<h3>呢絨小運單　尚未恢復簽發</h3>
<p>本市呢絨業買賣呢絨匹頭、自經當局規定運送一匹以上者、須向興亞院申請其領大運單、滿一匹者須領小運單、然後可以自由在租界區內搬運後、旋因當局杜絕流弊、大小運單、均暫行停止簽發、達二十餘日之久、致使同業問交割送貨、均受阻礙、最近火運單已由當局恢復簽發、惟小運單則仍未發給、因此同業買賣、殊感不便、蓋照過去辦法、申請具領大運單、因須請求興亞院核准、手續較繁、小運單申請手續、則比較簡易、故一般商人、均願舍繁就簡、請領小運單、加以目前呢絨價格高昂、同業間交割買賣、匹數極微、殊無請領大運單、裝車運送之必要、所以一般呢絨商號、均望呢絨小運單恢復發給云、</p>
<h3>棉布市况寥落</h3>

<h3>英美捲煙　直綫下降　大量香烟將予適當配給</h3>
<p>香烟賣價、昨日起伏甚巨、晨開各牌價格如直綫下降、波濤洶湧、致投機者忽喜忽憂、蓋因英美貨在廢歷年內、尙有派貨、故人心虛怯、初開如大英牌猛瀉至一萬〇五白元、後市重升一萬一千三百元、相差八百元、老刀牌再小做過九千五百元後、俄至一萬元收盤、品海牌七千四百元、五華牌六千四百元、結果價較上日軋小四五百元、仙女牌七千九百元、未更動、日烟金槍牌三千元、紅玫瑰二千六百五十元、金大樓三千七百元、全祿牌三千四百五十元、念枝三千一百元、指南牌二千七百元、均小一百元强、國烟漲慢跌亦緩、計金字塔六千三百五十元、美麗脾五千七百五十元、金鼠四千一百元、白金龍四千一百五士元、黄金龍三千二百元、甚鮮變化、</p>
<p>又據權威方面透露消息、過去香烟售價、一再狂漲、原因有二、一爲時屆舊曆年底、一爲配給機構正在改組、以致配給工作稍形阻滯、最近機構改組、即將吿竣、備有大量香烟、由新組合適當配給、故香烟售價、不久即可穩定，</p>
<h3>火柴回落亦速</h3>
<p>火柴市面、疾淮銳退、做開計鳳凰脾三千六百元、美麗牌三千八百元、金鼎牌三千二百元、雜牌二千一百五十元、較上日跌落三四百元光景、</p>
<h3>日本紡織業的轉變</h3>
<p>多年來執日本輕工業的牛耳，而在世界織維產業界中佔有絕對地位的日本紡績界，在這次繼中國事變而來的大東亞戰爭勃發之後，爲適應時勢，已在改變其向來的面貌了。由於一向求給於敵國的原棉已吿斷絕，國內產業界已轉移其重點於軍需產業之故，日本紡績界目前乃向下列二途進行；即一為求其原料於大東亞共榮圈內，一爲從事整理紡績設備，以圖將其全力積極移注於適合時代性的生產。故最近對於華北棉花的增產，南方佔領地域的棉花開發，同時將其設備向海外進駐，或將國內的紡績資本改投於時局性的產業，工廠設備的運出等之傾向，實現頗著，其現狀就各公司分別而論，則如左述。現在大東亞戰爭已近在決定的階段，國內產業的超重點生產正被要求之時，紡績界的這種傾向，今後將見共益趨强化。</p>
<p>日本紡績會社　鹿兒島工廠的紡機，合計錠子三萬枚，最近已全部移駐於上海。更注目於華北，爲樹立百年之計，致力於棉花的增產，强化天津，青島二廠。在西里伯及非島方面，亦已派遣技術員，着手於棉作事業的開發。又該公司所屬的岸和田第一廠，以及津鹿兒島等各休閒工廠，現已改充士兵學校，訓練所等軍管機關之用。一方面在中國大陸，經營中國啤酒廠，天寗造紙廠，佛慈製藥廠等，作爲其旁系公司。</p>
<p>東洋紡績會社　該公司所屬大曾根紡績廠的設備，已移駐於上海：在西里伯島及菲島方面，則進行棉作事業：在爪哇及加羅島方面，設立布廠和紡績廠：又在加羅島和香港兩地，經營燜草，在昭南島（即新加坡）亦仲其巨手於橡皮事業，其在大阪四寶島，西成，三軒屋等處三工廠的寄宿所，已充大阪鐵工廠及住友金屬工廠之用。</p>
<p>鐘淵紡績會社　現正計畫移動其機械設備以擴充在華八所工廠之用；在南方菲島及西里伯島上，則設立棉作本部其董事福長水太郞等。已在開始活躍中。</p>
<p>富士紡績會社　已派遺職員至緬甸從事棉作的活動。</p>
<p>大和紡績會社　其棉作先遣隊已進入菲律賓呂宋島。</p>

<h3>生於憂患</h3>
<p>— 紀小裳</p>
<p>買新生君的「再談蘇秦」後、不禁聯想到「生於憂患，死於安樂。」的古訓。</p>
<p>西諺亦有：「適度的貧窮，足以刺激人努力。」可見貧窮和困苦不但不是壞東西，並可使人努力而有所表現和建樹。不過，倘使一個人甘於貧苦沒世，不思爾發，　當然又作別論了。</p>
<p>孟夫子說過：「天之將降大任於私人也，必先苦其心志，勞其筋骨……」這幾句話，想必是大家耳熟能詳的。所以，一個人在幼年時代的安富尊榮，舒服享受，實在是努力上進的一層障碍，貧苦的子弟，正不必對之羨慕！</p>
<p>「貧莫貧於無才，賤莫賤於無志。」出身寒苦，不足悲；生於憂患，不必嘆。只要有志向，只要能努力，那末貧窮和困苦適足以磨鍊身心，使我們獲得來日的安樂。</p>
<p>種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆。假使蘇秦當時沒有那樣以錐刺股，發奮努力，何以得有後來那種成就呢？</p>
<h3>足資楷模的叔蘋公獎學金</h3>
<p>— 黃警頑</p>
<p>物價的高漲，使一般人的生活受到極大的威脅，靠薪水維持家庭的人，一日三餐，已感不易，如果再要負擔一筆子女敎育費，那更是難乎其難了。許多有爲的靑年，在經濟困難的壓迫下，不得不輟了學，這實是社會重大的損失。所以救濟靑年失學，實是很急切的問題，社會上不少熱心人士，舉辦了獎學金助學金等，對淸寒子弟予以熱誠的援助，使他們的升學有一個保障，在這裏要介紹的，就是叔蘋公獎學金。</p>
<p>叔蘋公獎學金創始於民國二十七年，至今已舉辦至第六期，主辦人係叔蘋公後裔顧乾麟先生，顧先生秉承先人遺志，對提倡義務敎育，不遺餘力。叔蘋公獎學金所欲資助的，是家境確係淸寒而無力升學的優秀學生，所以對得獎學生的選定，極其嚴格，申請者資格，須學業成績在八十五分以上，操行優良，而家庭狀况經調查後確屬淸寒者，始准參與老試。同時有一點要注意的，就是巳得他處助學金或獎學金的學生，不能再得叔蘋公獎學金。他們對於調查家庭狀况的工作，極爲認眞，冬日冒着風寒，夏天當着烈日，東西奔走，不辭辛苦，這種熱心社會事務的精神，眞足令人欽佩。</p>
<p>錄取的學生，由該獎學金資助學費，成績好的，並得資助書籍費，該獎學金對於學生課業，極爲注意，規定學生於每月十日以前，必須作學業狀况月報一次，報告他們的學習心得與生活狀况。這樣不但能督促學生努力求學，并且還可以知道學生的生活情形，至於學　成績特佳，總平均在九十五分以上的學生，尚有一學期膳宿費津貼的獎勵，由此可見叔蘋公獎學金對資助淸寒學生的熱心了。</p>
<p>除此之外，叔蘋公獎學金還　請高明醫生替學生檢查體格和免費治療，使學生的健康得以保障，以免一旦罹疾，忍受輾轉呻吟之苦。所以叔蘋公獎學金不但幫助學生解決升學的困雞，並且還盡量替學生解決生活上的痛苦，使他們能安心向學。</p>
<p>靑年學生是國家的柱石，培植靑年就是培養國家的精華，救濟淸寒學生升學雖然是艱苦的工作，可是它的意義是積極的，它對於社會的貢獻是偉大的，叔蘋公獎學金主辦人顧乾麟先生能以他全部的精神，寳貴的時間與金錢貢獻於救濟淸寒學生的偉大工作上，社會上實屬不可多見。希望社會上富有的人士也都能效法顧先生熱心服務的精神，多做一些有益社會的事業。我和顧公父子，素不相識，寫此文的目的，完全出於自動，只爲欽佩他的助學精神，現方經辦本報讀者助學金工作，更要惕勵奮勉忠誠服務。（酬助濟貧金）</p>

<p>她是一個善於演奏的人，並且是一個優美的音樂家。加德鄒又穿了皮裘戴上煖手簡，參加十二月裏的宿舍比賽，加德鄒在演說日給獎之後的園遊會裏，加德鄰在發生的任何小問題上投出勸告。也是好的勸告——他不見得時常會聽，但是却時常會影響他。</p>
<p>「吉普斯，親愛的，如果我做了你，我就讓他們去了。畢竟這不是什麼很嚴厲的事。」</p>
<p>「我知道，我也喜歡讓他們去，但是如果我這樣做了，我怕他們還要再犯。」</p>
<p>「試試看，坦白的告訴他們，給他們機會。」</p>
<p>「我就這樣辦。」</p>
<p>偶然也的確有嚴重的事情。</p>
<p>「你知道，吉普斯，將這幾百個孩子禁閉在這裏，的確是小自然的安排，你只要想想就可以知道。因此，如果有什麼不應該的事情發生了，就此責罰他們，好像他們的所以在這裏，就是他們自己的過錯，你不會想道是有些不公平嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不知道這個，加娣，不過我的確知道，爲了大家的緣故，我們對於這樣的事情，應該相當嚴厲些。一頭黑羊是會染汚其他的羊的。」</p>

<h3>再評李少春之「洗浮山」</h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>李少春第三日打泡戲爲「余叔岩親授」之洗浮山（引廣告上語），前面還有白玉薇高維廉之得意緣，據說又是「小翠花親授」的。我雖不望他們眞能學得到家，但只要得其神韻一二，也就十分滿足了。</p>
<p>趕到天蟾，王半仙正在唱那幾句搖板。艾世菊演來並不精彩，嗓既不亮，抓哏亦嫌貧俗，我總覺得他文丑不如武丑戲好。半仙捉不著白狐大仙，搬來了關平周倉降妖，飾周倉者爲蕭德寅，噴火，抓鬚，腰腿工夫，都好，惜馬鴻麟的關平亚不見佳。是日班世超特別卯上，但出手少而要槍要鞭特多，總不免遮短之嫌，而且也叫人看著覺得鬆弛。總之，靑石山這齣戲除了呂洞賓之外，武旦，丑，武生，架子花，都有戲做。尤其對王半仙的諷刺，把天神妖精寫得那麼有人性（指周倉等幾個身段而言，都値得我們讚美。）</p>
<p>接著，就是白玉薇之得意緣。這在花旦戲中，也不失爲一齣很有風趣的好戲。惜白玉薇太差，扮相俗，身段呆，口齒也不淸，無論從哪方面都看不出小翠花半點兒影子來。我尤討厭她的唱，乏味，不貼絃，且不說，唱到末了，還要患瘧疾似地突然翻高作顫音。也虧得那把胡琴配得上，照樣也拉鋸似地跟著。居然還有人喝彩，那就更絕了。可看的，還是高維廉之廬昆杰。說白，唱，做，都還對付，自始至終，只看見他一人做戲，我們的「小翠花」倒反而被罩蓋下去了。但是，因爲太顧到做戲，這些地方就不免過火。不錯，得意綠是一齣玩笑戲，不能講究什麼合理不合理，但抓哏總要恰到好處，大哭大叫，就地打滾，似乎大可不必。</p>
<p>休息十分鐘，洗浮山上塲。先上來的是毛慶來之黃天霸，出塲身段，淌馬的架子，都不壞，見人頭後一站，往上塲門走去，身段邊式之至。惜第二次出塲，在下塲門擰一旋子，擰得太低。李少春出塲，觀衆報以滿堂彩，李之受捧似比寳森更甚，不知何故。此戲以余派標榜，開頭的確有幾分老生演武戲的穏重味兒，但入後和賊兵交戰，偷了很多出手套數，入和下手開打尤爲猛烈，難道這些都是叔岩的一路麼？我不禁深深地懷疑著。賀死後托夢給賀人傑，幾句二簧反調，有叔岩的味兒，但口勁及醇厚離叔岩的境界太遠了。</p>
<p>綜觀此次成績，李的武工，的確很可觀，但唱實不敢恭維。我想，少春自己也不是不知道，徵之他多貼孫悟空金錢豹一類戲而益信。但自己的長處既在武，就該私下多下工夫，多排身段，多學幾齣武生正工戲。要說專攻鬍子吧，那也行。那就萬萬不能拿什麼兩將軍和擊鼓駡曹併在一塊唱。須知「文武全才」是指老生而有武工底子而言，照李少春的材料，武工有，嗓音寬亮俱全，就是日勁差些，只要多下工夫，將來是不難做到這地步的。這可決不是叫你叔岩而兼小樓。望少春三思！</p>

<h3>我的冬賑建議</h3>
<p>— 榮柏雲</p>
<p>冬賑時間已甚迫促，故組織善團聯合會實急不容緩，爲此喚起各界，茲分頭設法進行，將愚見略說，以供同志之採納焉。</p>
<p>（一）組織冬賑善團聯合會之利益　蓋善團不聯繫合作，其弊凡三；一·人力薄弱，所做範圍不廣而耗費則較多；二·因組織不健全，難使社會信仰而得多數人之援助；三·財物各自發放，每偏重於鬧市，偏僻處貧民大都向隅，苦樂不勻，組織聯合會後，則人材可以集中，募款則分別負責，施賑則分區負責、前述三弊，斯可免矣。欲達如上目的，應立即登報召集各有關冬賑善團及工商界熱心公益人士，組織聯合會成立總辦事處，由各團體推舉熱心之士，主持一切以促進行，完成救濟任務。</p>
<p>（二）賑款慕集方法　（甲）賑款欲純賴各界自動捐助，祗有喚醒社會富裕者，使人人明白輸財濟貧爲偉大且應爲之善舉，其得益非僅受惠之貧黎，而輸財者本人與子孫所得善報，較所輸之數有增多千百倍者，此乃眞正的儲蓄，普通儲金遺傳子孫，子孫十九不保，此種儲蓄是一百二十分可靠的。（乙）由賑聯會具名，向當局要求批准委託全市保甲處義務向各戶募賑，每戶（一宅作一戶）規定認捐年菜節約移作冬賑費二十元，由保甲處收集後彙交賑聯會，就全滬四百萬人口計算，每四十人作一戶，合十萬戶，收入應有二百萬元，甲乙兩項捐款統計，或能集到三百萬元亦意中事。</p>
<p>（三）施賑調查步驟　調查手續，欲求其迅速與普遍，亦袱有委託全滬保甲處義務代勞，露宿者予以急賑，隱貧者予以緩賑，露宿者原無戶口證，應分別給以「〇〇保露宿人〇〇號與姓名性別及年齡」等憑票，以便據以領賑，庶公允普遍，惟着手調查，須全滬保甲在同日同時舉行，如蒙當局贊助，將全滬交通斷絕半小時則更佳，藉杜一人到兩處地方登記而得雙份露宿證之弊。</p>
<p>（四）財物收集與保管之總部　應擇適當地點設全滬善團聯合會總辦事處辦理之。其收支賬務與保管之責任，應請會計師公會委派義務人員主持之。</p>
<p>上述四項，如能按步就班辦理得宜，在目前而論，貧苦者固已受惠逾恒，而賑聯會仍能進一步而向積極途程邁進，從事墾植生產與開設工廠等企業爲澈底之救濟，　徒滬上貧苦者之大幸，亦卽改進社會之一大問題也，蒭　之言，是否可行，敬希各界善長公決。</p>

<h3>How to Control Prices?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we discussed and offered suggestions regarding price control measures. Now, we will further discuss several key points that the authorities, business community, and the general public should pay attention to in managing and controlling prices, as follows:</p>
<p>First of all, we always believe that economic issues are part of political issues. If the political foundation is sound and the institutions are robust, any economic measures will naturally be easy to implement. Conversely, it will be difficult and ineffective, achieving half the result with twice the effort. Even with good laws and intentions, it is often difficult to achieve the desired results. In the past, the various controls implemented by the government authorities, initially legislated with good intentions, often resulted in abuses. Why? Because they suffered from an unsound political system. The general public often attributes the ineffectiveness of government actions to the unsoundness of institutions. However, why are the institutions unsound? It should still be acknowledged that it is due to a poor political foundation. Frankly speaking, in recent years, our people have only heard many beautiful slogans and touching banners. Many political problems have seen little reform. Currently, many undeniable morbid conditions are not only due to the unsoundness of institutions but also because the fundamental political issues are deeply ingrained and difficult to reverse with just a piece of paper or an order. Therefore, when considering the comprehensive control of prices in the future, we hope that everyone will work together to eliminate the root causes of past political problems. Otherwise, it will be a great obstacle to the future of control.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can point out that although controlling prices is about controlling goods, controlling goods must first start with controlling people, especially those who control people. If those who control people are well-controlled, then the general public can be expected to be well-controlled, and then goods can be expected to be well-controlled. When it comes to the issue of prices, we often denounce unscrupulous merchants who disrupt prices. In reality, so-called unscrupulous merchants are probably people with influence and connections in society. They have their ways. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants must be suppressed, and officials engaging in business must be strictly prohibited. The government already has a ban on civil servants engaging in commercial activities. This law must now be thoroughly implemented. The government should investigate which officials are concurrently serving as chairmen, directors, or managers of commercial banks or enterprises, or which merchants have become officials (especially in finance, economics, and control work). For these people with dual identities of officials and merchants, they should be ordered to resign from their official positions or business roles and specialize in one field. They should not be allowed to move freely and benefit from both sides. If the government can achieve this step and then provide strict training and assessment to personnel at all levels actually responsible for price control, the public's perception will be renewed, and significant results can be achieved in price control.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the organizations and personnel implementing price control, first, the implementing organizations must be unified. Because if the organizations are not unified, it will not only cause confusion for various industries and businesses but also lead to mutual constraints, evasions, and conflicts, which will inevitably hinder work efficiency. This must be carefully considered for comprehensive price management. Second, the leading authorities must adopt a supportive attitude towards industry, agriculture, and mining. A piece of paper or an order cannot solve the problem. If punishment is used lightly, it will make those engaged in production feel helpless. How can we expect an increase in production? Especially as mentioned in this newspaper a few days ago, China is a country dominated by small and medium-sized producers. The characteristics of small production are dispersion and weakness. The right remedy is to support their development and production, economically stimulate their interest in expanding production, and provide financial assistance for their capacity to expand production. This can solve the price problem from a positive perspective by increasing production. Third, those handling control work must act with conscience, be serious, and apply the rules without exception. A common problem in Chinese society is emphasizing relationships over law. Everyone takes pride in not being bound by laws and only expects others to abide by the law, especially powerful local officials and wealthy and unscrupulous gentry. They usually try their best to get by through flexibility and non-compliance. National laws often cannot be implemented effectively. These people are the culprits. In the future, we must pay close attention to eradicating this bad habit. Fourth, in terms of the implementing agencies, superiors should take more responsibility for their subordinates, providing guidance tirelessly, supervision as strict as possible, and reviews as frequent as possible. If the lower-level agencies implement policies improperly or cause abuses, the upper-level agencies should not only be held responsible for negligence but also bear joint responsibility.</p>
<p>Price control must be comprehensive and thorough. However, it cannot rely solely on laws and documents or the efforts of the authorities alone. It requires the united effort of the entire nation to be effective. Here, the first requirement is "openness." To the top and bottom, there must be thoroughness, no concealment, no cover-up, revealing the truth in everything, and announcing the real situation everywhere. By handling things openly, we can eliminate factors that allow for corruption through secrecy and gradually cultivate social disciplinary forces because all controls and punishments are made public to society, making everyone ashamed of non-compliance. Third, high-ranking government officials need to come forward and set an example of compliance with the law. The Chinese social tradition emphasizes relationships over principles, and the "inherent morality" of bending the law for personal connections really cannot exist today. It must start with high-ranking officials, emphasizing reason and abiding by the law. If there are exemplary cases of upholding justice even against family members in the government, there will be admirable cases of breaking away from personal relationships in society. Changing customs and practices and working together to overcome difficulties is an urgent task today, and it is not only relevant to the issue of prices.</p>
<h3>Supreme National Defense Council Resolution: Adjust Provincial Administrative Structure; Provincial Government to Adopt Governor System; Revised Organizational Regulations for Economic Council</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – After the National Government decided to participate in the war against England and the United States, the Supreme National Defense Council was established to establish a wartime system. The focus of the first meeting was the adjustment of central administrative agencies. The focus of this week's second meeting was the adjustment of local administrative structures, still based on the principle of a unitary system for administrative agencies to clarify responsibilities and enhance administrative efficiency. It was resolved that the provincial government would adopt a governor system. Decisions were also made to strengthen the National Economic Council and the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee. The third meeting will focus on establishing wartime economic policies. The important resolutions of the second meeting are summarized as follows: (1) The proposal to change the provincial government to a governor system: According to the organization of local governments at all levels, counties have a county magistrate system, cities have a mayor system, but the organization of provincial governments is still a committee system, which lacks clear responsibility and efficient performance. To adhere to the principle of a unitary system for administrative agencies, it is proposed to abolish all clauses in the current provincial government organization law regarding the committee system and change the provincial government to a governor system. The main points are as follows: A. The provincial government will have one governor, specially appointed, who will manage all provincial administrative affairs under the direction of the President of the Executive Yuan and supervise all subordinate agencies and officials. B. The organizational law of the provincial government will be drafted and revised by personnel designated by this council, submitted for discussion at the next meeting, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and amendment. C. The existing departments, offices, bureaus, and other agencies of the provincial governments will remain as they are until the amended organizational law of the provincial government is promulgated. D. All current members of the provincial government will be relieved of their membership titles. Those who concurrently hold positions as directors, secretaries-general, or bureau chiefs should immediately specialize in their original positions as civil servants. E. The provincial government will have four to six councilors. F. Current members of the provincial government may be transferred to serve as councilors of the provincial government. G. The provincial government should establish a provincial affairs meeting, equivalent to the municipal affairs meeting of cities and the county affairs meeting of counties. At this meeting, it was resolved to specially appoint Li Shiqun as the governor of Jiangsu Province, Chuan Shishuo as the governor of Zhejiang Province, Gao Guanwu as the governor of Anhui Province, Yang Kuiyi as the governor of Hubei Province, and Chen Yaozu as the governor of Guangdong Province. (2) Organizational regulations and personnel appointments for the National Economic Council: The organizational regulations stipulate that there will be one chairman, concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan, two vice-chairmen, concurrently held by the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and a number of members, specially appointed by the National Government, including the ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry, Construction, and Food of the Executive Yuan, and the directors-general of Finance, Industry, and Construction of North China as ex officio members. According to these regulations, in addition to the chairman being concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan, the vice-chairmen being concurrently held by Chairman Wang of the North China Political Affairs Commission and Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan, and Mei Siping, Chen Junhui, Gu Shiheng, Wang Shijing, Wang Yintai, and Yu Jinhe as ex officio members, and the original members of the Economic Council remaining in their positions, famous figures in the economic circle who are not in office will be recruited. Zhou Zuomin, Tang Taomin, Wu Lixiu, Xiang Kangyuan, Li WuBo, Jiang Shangda, and Sun Zhongli will be specially appointed as members of the National Economic Council, and Mei Siping, Wang Shijing, Wang Yintai, Gu Baohang, Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, and Wu Zhenxiu will be designated as standing members. The opinions of two others are still being sought. Chen Junhui will be specially appointed as the Secretary-General of the National Economic Council. (3) After the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee was transferred to the National Government according to the resolution of the first meeting, this meeting resolved to specially appoint Wang Yitang and Zhou Zuoren as members of the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee and designated them as standing members. (4) The chairman reported that a vacancy had occurred for Committee Member Yin Tong of the Central Political Committee, and Wang Shijing was appointed as a member of the Central Political Committee. (5) Yu Jinhe was specially appointed as a standing member of the North China Political Affairs Commission and Director-General of the Construction Department.</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations of the Economic Council</p>
<p>Article 1: The National Government establishes the National Economic Council to review economic policies and regulate economic administration. (Article 2) The National Economic Council has one chairman, concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan, and two vice-chairmen, concurrently held by the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. (Article 3) The National Economic Council has a number of members, specially appointed by the National Government. The ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry, Construction, and Food of the Executive Yuan, and the directors-general of Finance, Industry, and Construction of North China are ex officio members. (Article 4) The National Economic Council has seven to nine standing members, designated by the chairman from among the members. (Article 5) The National Economic Council holds a plenary meeting once every three months, and extraordinary meetings may be convened when necessary.

Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council of the National Government of the Republic of China, Wang Zhaoming.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Retreat Westward from Mejes El-Erb Area; Axis Forces Occupy Mountains South of the Area; British Forces Have Not Yet Engaged Main German-Italian Force</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (DOMEI) – Regarding the battles in North Africa, Berlin authorities stated that General Rommel's Africa Corps is acting according to plan in the territory of Tripolitania. The Allied Command acknowledged that the Axis forces made slight progress southwest of Dufa on Sunday, but Berlin stated that the Allied forces in the Mejes El-Erb area have retreated westward and the Axis forces have advanced and occupied the mountains south of the area.</p>
<p>Rome, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian Military Headquarters issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the result of the engagement between the advance reconnaissance units of both sides in the Fezzan area was favorable to our side. Our reconnaissance teams have made considerable gains on the Tunisian front. The German and Italian air forces actively assisted ground battles and air control of enemy positions on the same day. Axis aircraft shot down nine enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft artillery shot down an enemy four-engine aircraft. Our aircraft bombed Bona. An enemy convoy off the coast of Algeria was attacked by our aircraft, sinking a medium-sized steamship. Three other ships were hit and caught fire. Enemy aircraft repeatedly attacked Tripoli, causing some damage to buildings. Some residents of Libya were killed or injured. Enpuduguer Port was attacked by enemy aircraft, and military targets were not hit, but some buildings were damaged. Two residents were killed and nine were injured. Anti-aircraft fire shot down one enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – Although there are fierce battles in Libya, General Montgomery has not yet been able to engage the main force of the German-Italian tank corps, only coming into contact with their strong rearguard units. Therefore, General Rommel can still freely move his main force to the predetermined location and launch a counterattack at any time. The British Eighth Army currently has about four tank divisions and five to six infantry divisions. Its left wing continues to advance, attempting to seize the position of the Axis forces' southern wing, and then join forces with the rebels in southern Tunisia, advancing north to the Gabès Strait to cut off the Axis forces between Tunisia and Tripoli. The hope of realizing this plan is very slim.</p>
<h3>Situation in Stalingrad Area Gradually Stabilizing; Isolated German Troops Still Tenaciously Defending Positions; Repeated Soviet Offensives Repelled</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – Last night, a telegram from the front line stated that the situation in the Stalingrad area is gradually stabilizing. A large number of Soviet troops have withdrawn from the area to the Don River area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – Yesterday, the defensive battles on the Eastern Front continued fiercely. The focus of military affairs was in the south and the area south of the Ladoga Lake transport. The German-Romanian joint forces repelled the Soviet offensive in the Western Caucasus. The enemy's offensive southeast of Lake Ilmen failed to shake the German defense line. Soviet troops launched another fierce attack in the Ladoga Lake area and managed to break through the German defense line after suffering heavy casualties. On Monday, the Red Army lost a total of 32 tanks southeast of Ilmen and south of Ladoga Lake. The German and Allied air forces assisted the ground battles and made great efforts, shooting down 16 Soviet aircraft without any losses on our side.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (DOMEI) – According to an official announcement here last night, after a large-scale offensive by Soviet troops on Monday this week, German troops are strongly resisting together with Allied forces. Although Soviet troops have made some progress, they have paid a heavy price, losing more than 100 tanks, 18 aircraft, 80 cannons, and many other military supplies. The Soviet offensive was most fierce in the area from the Caucasus to the Don River bend and the Stalingrad area. In the Stalingrad area, the isolated German troops are tenaciously defending their positions. Only a few outposts have been withdrawn. Repeated offensives by the Red Army have been repelled.</p>
<p>Red Army Generals Transferred to New Posts</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet Supreme Command has recently transferred General Gigov, Commander of the Northern Front, to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union and appointed General Baronov as the newly created Marshal of Artillery. General Vasilevsky, the current commander of the Voronezh Front, has also been appointed as a corps commander.</p>
<h3>Uruguay to be First to Restore Diplomatic Relations with Soviet Union, According to Uruguayan Foreign Minister's Statement</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – Uruguayan Foreign Minister Yani, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro by plane on Monday morning, said that it is very gratifying that Uruguay is the first South American country to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Uruguay severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1936. Today, the Soviet Union has become one of the major belligerent countries, so Uruguay is willing to restore diplomatic relations with it. He hopes that other South American countries can follow in Uruguay's footsteps.</p>
<h3>Attlee Reports on North African Situation in House of Commons, Difficult to Completely Eliminate Axis Forces for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Churchill's Absence Raises Speculation, Rumored to Have Gone to US to Discuss North African Issue with Roosevelt</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – A London dispatch reports that the British Parliament convened its first meeting after the Christmas holiday yesterday. A total of 165 questions were raised in the House of Commons, all related to the production of war materials. During the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Attlee briefly reviewed the war situation, saying that the Soviet army had achieved great success. The Allied forces in North Africa are determined to completely eliminate the Axis forces, but due to the vast terrain, special climate, and enemy mobile units, it is still difficult to completely eliminate them. Although Rommel's troops were not completely defeated at El Agheila, they suffered very heavy losses. Now the German and Italian tank corps are trying to avoid contact with our troops, and it is not yet possible to predict when we can inflict a heavy blow on them. The government has great confidence in General Eisenhower and First Army Commander Anderson. The resistance on Malta is especially admirable. Malta has always been a thorn in the enemy's side. Regarding the situation in French North Africa, although there are differences of opinion between Britain and the United States, the situation is not as serious as propagandized. The British government is well aware that the United States maintaining diplomatic relations with Vichy has various conveniences. When Britain and the United States planned to attack North Africa, their attitude was very harmonious, because Britain and the United States have only one goal, which is to unite the French and fight against the Axis.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – A London dispatch reports that Prime Minister Churchill's absence from yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons has once again raised speculation that Churchill has been staying in Washington since the beginning of the month. It is generally expected that if Churchill and Roosevelt talk, the North African issue will be discussed first. Well-informed sources believe that Britain and the United States are bound to reach an agreement on this issue, so surprising news is expected to be released soon. The situation in North Africa has been serious since the beginning of January, so it is possible that Churchill went to the United States at that time to talk with Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Turkey and Hungary Hold Economic Negotiations</h3>

It is reported that the goal of the discussion is to revise the commodity exchange list.</p>

<p>Vichy, 19th (Havas World News Agency) – Government leader Laval received General Dentz, the former High Commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, today.</p>
<h3>Should Britain Abandon India? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Seeing Gandhi indulging in sophistry and self-contradiction, few Indians are provoked. They intuitively discern one meaning from his words to extract another. The upper-class Indians almost all possess two personalities like Gandhi. On one hand, they are pragmatists, their beliefs based on concrete facts in life; on the other hand, they are mystics and romantics.</p>
<p>Most Indians acknowledge this fact and, when defending Gandhi, say that he speaks in two languages. The first is the language of the past, with mystical and metaphysical traditional terms, which the Indian masses understand. The other is the language of modern political realism. Both voices are necessary.</p>
<p>Nehru, whose sentiments are quite different from Gandhi's, said to me when explaining this phenomenon: "You must separate Gandhi's personality from Gandhi as a national leader." Gandhi is a very practical politician. When he exercises leadership, he is very good at compromising and bargaining like anyone else. But he never gives up expressing his inner self, directly showing his personality, indicating that he is the conscience of the world, indicating that he is a moralist. The mixture of these two roles often confuses the outside world, making the latter seem like incomprehensible gibberish, embodying the Indian way of thinking.</p>
<p>Even though we find some of Gandhi's words seemingly absurd, this does not negate his position as a national leader. He is a man, he is a conscience, he is a great soul trusted by the majority of Indians, blindly followed and obeyed. Although his personal philosophy often has a presumptuous influence on Indian political thought, he displays great sensitivity when he uses his unique skills to plan a political action. He mobilized the leaders of the National Congress Working Committee, especially Nehru, to propose a cleverly worded proposal that was later passed by the All-India Congress, which proves this point.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Gandhi is arrested and imprisoned, most Indians will certainly feel spiritually imprisoned with him. Undoubtedly, if, as Sir Cripps' statement and others in the British government indicate, Britain has no intention of reopening negotiations, then Britain indeed has no way to go. But the British government does not seem to have foreseen the scale of the reaction.</p>
<p>To estimate the impact of the arrests of Gandhi, Nehru, and other leaders, we must first remember that they are symbols of the suffering of India, which has accumulated from nearly two centuries of British rule, and from twenty years of Indian people's struggle to get rid of the British rule. Under this pretext, they resolutely demanded the immediate establishment of an autonomous government, even though the United Nations has severe difficulties, and the National Congress acknowledges and sympathizes with the United Nations. In addition to the aforementioned suffering, there is now another suffering - the killing and bloodshed caused by the demonstrators resisting the British government's attempt to strangle the disobedience movement.</p>
<p>"Indian nationalists are like the Irish," Rajagopalachari, one of the leaders of the National Congress who recently broke with Gandhi over the war issue, said to me, "They have been fighting the British for so long that they cannot weigh the relative importance of what they already have and the new, more serious threat."</p>
<p>British and American people who come to India for the first time are slightly surprised to hear Indians say that they are "slaves," because in many ways they are more free than we are now. In general, they are freer than in semi-colonial countries. Indians enjoy a wide range of freedom of association, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly, etc. They have absolute freedom to express their opinions. Secret agents do not threaten personal safety. The war has not yet increased much economic hardship, and so far, there has been no unified management of daily necessary food.</p>
<p>In the streets of Calcutta, Delhi, and Mumbai, I have seen mass rallies and demonstrations organized by the Communist Party, with crowds shouting revolutionary slogans, denouncing British imperialism, and red flags fluttering actively in the breeze, without anyone interfering. Not long ago, many communists were in jail, but now the Communist Party supports the war, and it has become legal.</p>
<p>In Wardha, at all the gatherings where Gandhi and the National Congress planned to overthrow British rule, no one has ever attempted to dissolve the venue, not even a single policeman was present near the venue. The "Harijan" newspaper, published in many languages, obviously did not undergo censorship, and the threat of rebellion spread throughout the country. The members of the National Congress in Wardha are all safe and sound.</p>
<p>When asked for my opinion, I boldly said to a member of the National Congress: "You may be making the biggest strategic mistake. You already have 75% of freedom. Now you are ignoring the importance of defending this 75% and focusing on striving for the remaining 25%. You may lose both." However, few people paid attention to what I said.</p>
<p>The second point we must remember is that the old and new hatreds before and during the war have turned into a disease, and this disease is manifested in extreme suspicion of Britain, and no amount of Churchill-style rhetoric can remove this suspicion. Now, among the reasons why Indians hate Churchill, another has been added: in the Atlantic Charter, he specifically excluded India, which is an insult to India.</p>
<p>In many events that ultimately led to disappointment, many Indians now cite Cripps' visit to India. The result of Cripps' trip was particularly sad for Indian liberals and pro-British nationalists. Pro-British nationalists have long placed their confidence in the Labour Party, hoping that the Labour Party could create peaceful changes in India, and in industry, Cripps was a prominent figure. So when he came to India dramatically and negotiated the conditions for cooperation with the Indians within two weeks, which the Governor-General of India had been evading for more than two years, when Cripps arrived in India, the whole country was filled with hope. Afterwards, it was discovered that he was not even able to give India immediate autonomy. He miscalculated, thinking that guaranteeing independence after the war was enough. Little did he know that Japan's achievements had changed the situation, and the Indian people now view the post-war situation as uncertain as reincarnation.</p>
<h3>Chilean Senate Passes Resolution to Sever Relations with Axis Powers; Former President Writes Article Opposing It</h3>
<p>Santiago, Chile, 22nd [Day of Month], Huitong News Agency: The Chilean Senate convened a meeting yesterday at 5:00 PM and resolved to sever relations with the Axis Powers. The Foreign Minister and most cabinet members attended, demonstrating the importance of the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Foreign Minister Fernández elaborated on the international situation and President Ríos' policies, and then proposed the resolution to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers, which passed with a majority of 30 votes to 10.

<p>Santiago, Chile, 20th [Day of Month], Huitong News Agency: Former Chilean President Alessandri published an article in "Opinion Daily" yesterday, stating that Chile's severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers is a misfortune for Chile, as it could expose Chile to the danger of war. Regarding the recent proposal to hold a national referendum to decide on the issue of severance, he does not approve of this, because according to the Chilean Constitution, national referendums are not applicable to the decision of foreign policy. However, the Chilean government should be able to learn the true opinions of the people.</p>
<h3>US Post-War Merchant Ships Suffer Heavy Losses; Naval Escorts Still Insufficient; Heavy Naval Casualties</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th [Day of Month], Havas News Agency: According to the Associated Press in Washington, since the outbreak of the current war, the United States has lost 825 ships. A spokesperson for the Navy Department said today, "At least at sea, we have not yet reached the road to victory. We are currently doing everything we can to reduce the losses of our ships, but the number of ships lost is still very significant. The best method we have invented to protect ships is to form merchant ship convoys, but the facts have proven that it is still not enough. Today, the Southern Fleet is sailing overseas and is still suffering heavy losses, because Axis submarines are constantly appearing and disappearing in the Atlantic Ocean. The losses are even greater in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and along the southern coast of South America. In addition, according to news from London, people in the British government are deeply concerned about the current shipping situation. The British House of Lords and House of Commons are scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting next week to discuss the situation caused by the activity of Axis submarines.</p>

<h3>Implementation of New Retail Sugar System; Sales Based on House Donation Tickets; Method of Selling Based on Citizen Certificates Cancelled; Collection on the Fourth Day After Applying for Purchase</h3>
<p>The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to maintain the supply of sugar in Shanghai, with the approval of the military allocation authorities for the calculation of quantities, starting from the fourth phase, first tried it out in Nanshi. A reporter from Shanghai News learned from the cooperative office that the measures for selling sugar in the Public Concession and the French Concession were announced by the cooperative office yesterday and will be implemented on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Summary of the New System</p>
<p>Notice to all retailers: In order to carefully review house donation tickets to reduce congestion, the sales methods have been improved, and all Category A retailers have been divided into two groups to schedule sugar sales. The house donation tickets collected by each store must be sent to the office for review before they can be sold. This method will be implemented on the 23rd. All previous methods of selling sugar based on citizen certificates and the method of selling sugar based on household registration certificates in Zhabei District will be abolished. All retailers will uniformly sell sugar based on house donation tickets for auditing purposes. In addition to announcing the implementation date in the newspaper, the "Revised Measures" are attached to this document. It is hoped that they will be handled properly in accordance with the scheduled date. However, the receipts for the collected house donation tickets must be sent to the office between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM on the same day without delay (no receipts will be accepted after the deadline). In addition, the receipts for house donation tickets collected by each retailer and the sealed covers for sending donation tickets will be issued by the office. It is hoped that you will bring your store chop to the office on the 22nd of this month to collect them for future use. This is a special notice.</p>
<p>Scheduled Sugar Sales</p>
<p>New method of selling sugar based on house donation tickets: (1) This office will divide all middle-class retailers (excluding Nanshi) into two groups to schedule sugar sales. One group that sells sugar on odd days will collect house donation tickets on even days, and one group that sells sugar on even days will collect house donation tickets on odd days. Each store will clearly indicate the date at the door. (2) When food households need to purchase sugar, they must bring their house donation tickets to any retailer scheduled on the designated date three days in advance (excluding Nanshi) to apply for purchase. After the store collects the donation tickets, it will immediately issue a receipt. The food household will pay for the sugar at the original store and retrieve the house donation tickets on the fourth day (based on this receipt). If there are attached households, the sugar obtained should still be distributed according to the household. If the purchaser has any selfish or cunning behavior, the attached household is allowed to report to the office for investigation.</p>
<p>First Submit Donation Tickets</p>
<p>(3) The receipts for house donation tickets collected by each retail store will be of a style prescribed by the office and printed for use to ensure uniformity. Each store should compile its own numbers, affix an official store chop, and fill in the date. The donation ticket numbers filled in on the receipts must be carefully checked and must not be incorrect (the receipts should indicate the area, such as "Public Concession" for public concession donation tickets). The time for collecting house donation tickets is from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on the scheduled date. (4) Each retail store will sort out the house donation tickets collected each day and send them to the office in a special bag for review. After the office reviews them, it will affix a chop and record the amount of sugar that should be sold. When the store sends someone to send donation tickets next time, they will bring the original receipt from the office to retrieve the reviewed donation tickets for distribution. They will then send and retrieve donation tickets in this way in turn. (If the donation tickets were sent to the office for review last time, even if no donation tickets are collected next time, someone must come to the office to retrieve them and must not delay).</p>
<p>No Time Limit</p>
<p>(5) If the house donation tickets submitted by each food household are forged or altered, in addition to withholding the donation tickets, the authorities will be notified to prosecute the head of the household. (6) The time for each retail store to sell sugar each time will be based on the store's business hours and will not be restricted to avoid congestion. (7) The amount of sugar that should be sold per house donation ticket and the price should be handled in accordance with the notice. If there are any malpractices such as increasing or decreasing the amount beyond the limit price or adulteration, or deliberately making things difficult for purchasers, purchasers are allowed to report to the office or to the police agency nearby.</p>
<p>Strict Management</p>
<p>(8) Each retail store will register the amount of sugar in stock and sales in the account book on a daily basis and report it to the office once every ten days for verification. (9) If each retail store estimates that the amount of sugar applied for based on house donation tickets exceeds the amount in stock, it can ask the purchasers to apply for purchase at another store. (10) If any retailer violates the regulations, they will be suspended from allocation or have their registration permanently canceled, or be sent to the authorities for prosecution depending on the circumstances. (11) From the date of implementation of these measures, all previous measures for selling sugar based on citizen certificates and the restrictions on the amount of sugar that each store should sell each day will be abolished, and the supervisory personnel will be withdrawn. (12) These measures are approved by the authorities for implementation. If there are any matters that are not covered, they will be notified and stipulated at any time.</p>
<h3>National Diplomacy Promotion Association Holds Inaugural Meeting; 500 People from Diplomatic and Business Circles Attend</h3>
<p>Since the National Government resolutely participated in the war and signed agreements with friendly countries to return the concessions and abolish extraterritoriality, celebrities in Shanghai have recently initiated the organization of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association from the national standpoint, hoping to enhance friendship with friendly countries and jointly complete the construction of Greater East Asia. The association held its inaugural meeting at the Waldorf Hotel at 4:00 PM yesterday (30th). The ceremony was simple and grand. A total of more than 500 people attended, including Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Mamoru, Italian Ambassador to China De Li, German Consul General, Spanish Minister, Mayor Chen, and heads of various agencies, as well as business leaders Lin Xiu, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Leiqing, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yipeng, Xu Guanqun, etc.</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>After the formal ceremony, Chairman Wen Ruoting (representing Lin Kanghou) delivered an opening speech, elaborating on the significance of organizing the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, which is purely to represent the people and cooperate with the government in diplomacy. He expressed gratitude to the government for respecting public opinion and vigorously promoting it. Preparatory Committee member Wu Kaisheng reported on the preparation process: "Half a year ago, colleagues initiated this association. After months of careful discussion, it was approved by Chairman Wang. The President of the Council and Foreign Minister Chu strongly advocated it, and it was enthusiastically assisted by Ambassador Shigemitsu of friendly countries. After the country participated in the war, China and Japan have advanced from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death. At the same time, China and Japan signed agreements to return the concessions and abolish extraterritoriality, and Italy followed suit. All work depends on the people's efforts."</p>
<p>Five Tenets</p>
<p>Therefore, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association should be established as soon as possible, and the highest purpose of the government and the people is to jointly cooperate in diplomacy. Based on this important significance, the association hopes to awaken the people across the country to jointly promote new diplomatic avenues. There are five tenets: (1) Autonomous Renewal, (2) Promotion of Peace, (3) Elimination of Anglo-American Evil Forces, (4) Implementation of the Premier's Teachings, (5) Protection of Overseas Chinese. Finally, he briefly described the general outline of the association's work. Then, Foreign Minister Chu gave instructions, expressing extraordinary support and pleasure for the establishment of the association, believing that the association has a major mission, which is to enable the people and the government to work together and cooperate in diplomacy. Finally, he hoped that the association would make great contributions to diplomacy. Ambassador Shigemitsu then gave a speech, briefly saying that Shanghai is a concentration of Chinese talents, and the establishment of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association has even greater significance. In addition to expressing respect for the association, he expressed unlimited respect for the country's determination to participate in the war, and wished the association great contributions and success in diplomacy. Later, the Italian Ambassador, the German Consul General, and the Spanish Minister took the opportunity to give speeches, praising the National Diplomacy Promotion Association and supporting it.</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang Yipeng gave a speech on behalf of the people, saying, "A country's external political role is different from its internal political role. The internal political role is a contract between the government and the people, and the external political role is a contract between this country and another country. Therefore, the development of the external political role is mostly handled by the government and has nothing to do with the people. However, although the nature is different, there is also a common principle, that is, the internal political role is based on the premise of mutual benefit between the government and the people, and the external political role is also based on the premise of mutual benefit between the two countries. As a result, it cannot but affect internal affairs, and the name of national diplomacy has become a common term in political science. For example, in a store, foreign negotiations are of course the manager's authority, but if the other party asks what the owner's opinion is, then the owner cannot but admit it. The government's diplomatic strategy may have its flexibility for the sake of technical application, while national diplomacy is based on seeking truth from facts. Therefore, national diplomacy can make up for the shortcomings of government diplomacy, and it can also be said to be a guarantee of government diplomacy. Then, the government's foreign policy must be based on national public opinion in order to complement each other. China's participation in the Greater East Asia War is of course beneficial to both China and Japan. The fact that you have prepared for establishment is twelve points worth celebrating."</p>
<p>The association's constitution was then passed and the directors were elected. The list is recorded as follows: Honorary Chairman of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association Chen Gongbo, Honorary Directors Wen Zuomin, Li Sihao, Zhang Yipeng, Tang Shimin, Ye Fuxiao, Guo Shan, Counsellor Chu Minyi, Zhou Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Kaisheng, Zhao Zhengping, Xu Jianping, Pan Da, Li Fang, Pan Yang, Chen Xishi. The chairman read the congratulatory speech from the Nanjing Chinese National Diplomacy Association and sent a telegram to Chairman Wang to pay his respects, and then announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Central China Cotton Control Association Promotes Purchases; Exchanges Essential Goods for Cotton; Mr. Jiang Conducts Pilot Program in Jiangbei Area; Cotton Collected is Allocated to Various Textile Mills</h3>
<p>In order to promote the development of cotton purchase work in various places, the Central China Cotton Control Association transports daily necessities to the cotton-producing areas in exchange for local cotton. The specified necessities are cotton products, soap, matches, etc.</p>
<p>This method does not affect the purchase price of cotton and has the significance of barter trade, which can promote the amount of cotton on the market in various places. This proposal is still being solicited for opinions from all parties and will be piloted in the Jiangbei area. The cotton collected by the association will be allocated to Chinese and Japanese textile mills in Central China for use as raw materials for spinning yarn. It is reported that after obtaining the cotton raw materials, various textile mills have begun preparing for the production of yarn and cloth to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Four Promotion Areas in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to improve cotton varieties and increase production, the authorities have established cotton seed breeding farms in Shanghai, Northern Jiangsu, Nanjing, and other places. The cotton-producing areas in Northern Jiangsu are divided into four promotion areas: (1) Nantong, Rugao (2) Haimen, Qidong (3) Donghao (4) Yancheng Funing. Each promotion area in Yancheng will set up a cotton seed breeding farm to test plant Chinese, American, Indian, and other cotton varieties, taking the superior and discarding the inferior. 180 piculs of cotton seeds will be allocated to the four areas for breeding purposes. It is stipulated that Datizi cotton should be tested in the two counties of Tong and Ru, and Jinzizi cotton should be tested in the three counties of Jian, Fu, and Dong.</p>
<h3>Cease Lighting in the French Concession after 8 PM – Storefront Lights, Not a Mandatory 8 PM Closing</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumor that stores in the French Concession must close at 8 PM, the information circulating is not entirely accurate. This reporter has learned that the French authorities have stipulated that storefront lights must be turned off after 8 PM. Stores will close automatically if they cannot operate without storefront lights. Conversely, if they are not affected by the lack of storefront lights, they can continue to operate. The purpose of this measure by the French authorities is to vigorously promote electricity conservation, in accordance with an order from the French Consulate General. From January 1st of this year, the newly approved electricity consumption is 85% of the amount stipulated in October of last year. In other words, the electricity conservation limit is at least 15%. Therefore, the French Medical Office, based on the Consulate General's notice, investigates the electricity usage of each store and household daily, striving to achieve the following conditions: (1) Store window lights must be completely turned off from 8 PM to 7 AM the next morning; advertising lights, signs, and decorative lights are absolutely prohibited. (2) The intensity of lights inside stores and residences should be reduced. (3) Offenders will be punished; in severe cases, the electricity supply will be cut off.</p>
<h3>National Government Prepares to Hold a Citizens' Assembly in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The local branch of the Tong Meng News Agency reports that the National Government is currently preparing to hold a citizens' assembly, scheduled for February 15th at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. The purpose is to enable the people of Shanghai to understand the intention of China and Japan to jointly oppose the Allied Powers and to solidify the people's determination to support the National Government. Key government figures, such as Lin Baisheng of the Propaganda Department and Mayor Chen Gongbo, will attend and give speeches.</p>
<h3>Fourteen Japanese National Policy Companies Hold a Joint Meeting to Discuss Joint Operations – Chinese and Japanese Share Capital Planned to be Concentrated and Distributed Separately – Kenji Kodama Will Go to Nanjing to Discuss Major Plans</h3>
<p>As various Japanese national policy companies are now brewing a merger operation, attracting great attention from Chinese and Japanese financial circles, the Central China Reconstruction Company held an important meeting at the Broadway Mansions yesterday. Representatives from fourteen national policy companies, including the Central China Railway Company, the Central China Water and Electricity Company, the Central China Urban Public Bus Company, and the Central China Electrical Communications Company, participated. The theme of the discussion was how to concentrate the Japanese and Chinese share capital within each company separately and transfer it to the Central China Development Company. The purpose of this merger of national policy companies is to form an industrial and commercial trust, internally combining several units, and then redistributing the concentrated capital to the original units. At the same time, the status of Chinese employees will be elevated in the merged organization. Yesterday's meeting was chaired by Kenji Kodama, President of the Central China Development Company, with the Vice President and Chairman of the Board also attending. At the beginning of the meeting, Kodama reported on the mission of his visit to China and the changes in Japan's economic policy toward China. He also elaborated on the company's budget and plans for the next fiscal year. The heads of the various departments of the company also reported on the financial situation in various parts of Central China. It is reported that Kodama Kenji has been in Shanghai for more than a week since arriving from Japan, staying at the Broadway Mansions. He will soon go to Nanjing to consult with officials from the Japanese Embassy and Japanese economic advisors on major plans.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Conscription are Merely the Worries of Ordinary People – Mayor Chen Issues a Statement – Enlisting Troops Will Absolutely Not Start with Conscription</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumors circulating about conscription, Mayor Chen issued the following statement yesterday: "Since [omission] there has been a rumor circulating in the city about conscription. People are overly worried and uneasy, but in reality, this is just the worry of ordinary people. Investigating the reasons for this rumor, there are probably only a few: (1) The opposition deliberately creates rumors to confuse people and shake the public's faith in the government, hoping to hinder the national policy of joining the war. (2) Some ignorant compatriots lightly believe rumors and spread them, creating this seemingly true but false tale. In fact, we only need to think calmly, and it will not be difficult to understand. Although the New Citizens' Movement has the measure of training young people, this is to improve the national quality of the people through training and is completely different from conscripting young men. As for China enlisting troops, there are laws to follow, and it will absolutely not start with conscription. I hope the citizens will not fall for the enemy's tricks and disturb themselves. If anyone deliberately creates rumors, they will be severely punished according to the law once verified."</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Winter Relief Variety Show Has Already Begun</h3>
<p>The fundraising committee for the municipal government's 31st-year winter relief fund variety show has begun yesterday at the Grand Theater.

The amount of sales was originally for eight days, but to meet the public's needs before it is sold out, it is scheduled to be completed before 4 PM on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Authorities Strictly Investigate Thugs Forcibly Selling Books and Newspapers – Report Any Discoveries Quickly to the Police</h3>
<p>Recently, there have often been Easterners pretending to be Japanese, going door-to-door to forcibly sell old magazines and books at exorbitant prices, some as high as twenty or thirty yuan. If someone refuses to buy, they threaten to take severe measures. According to a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, the police authorities of the two concessions are currently paying attention to this matter and will investigate and arrest those who impersonate identities to forcibly sell books and newspapers. It is reported that these thugs are proficient in various languages, so foreigners are most often deceived. Police officers stated that if such incidents are discovered in the future, report them to the nearest police station as soon as possible for investigation. It is also reported that in addition to the above situation, some people are falsely using the name of the Japanese Red Cross to solicit donations door-to-door, threatening those who refuse to donate. The police department is also closely monitoring this situation.</p>

<h3>Gao Nianshuo Diligently Assists Education, Spare No Effort – Proceeds from the Sale of Donated Fox Fur Coats Fully Used for Scholarships – Colleagues are Moved and Should Make an Exception to Follow Suit</h3>
<p>The deadline for primary and secondary schools to collect registration forms for the fourth reader scholarship has passed, with the deadline for primary schools set for the 22nd and for secondary schools set for the 23rd. If secondary school students have not yet obtained their report cards, they are allowed to submit them later, but they must have a letter of certification from the school. As for the date and location of the qualification examination, please pay attention to the announcements in this newspaper daily. The parents and guarantors of applicants should also pay attention at all times, as there are four to five thousand applicants, spread across the concessions and the city, and it is impossible to notify everyone by mail due to time and manpower constraints. A continuation sheet with academic records must be attached to the submitted registration form; otherwise, it will be impossible to process.</p>
<p>Donating Fox Fur Coats</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Gukuyusheng yesterday, saying, "Time flies, and the enthusiastic gentlemen of your newspaper are once again working hard for the scholarship fund. Educating talents for society and cultivating vitality for the country is such a great thing. This humble person has exhausted his meager efforts in the previous three sessions, donating what little he could. Unexpectedly, recently, the situation has become far worse than before. Business is sluggish, expenses are high, and income cannot meet expenses. It is difficult to make a living. This time, I intended to provide further assistance, but it is really beyond my means. If I were to stop here, I would feel great spiritual pain every morning when I read about the scholarship fund in your newspaper. After thinking hard, I came up with a humble solution. More than ten years ago, I acquired a fox fur coat, which I plan to entrust to your newspaper for auction. It is worth about three to five thousand Central Reserve Certificates, and I will donate all of it to the scholarship fund. I wonder if you gentlemen would be willing to go to the trouble of alleviating my spiritual pain? If you agree, please reply immediately, and I will send the coat. I apologize for the presumption and wish you well. Respectfully, Gukuyusheng, January 18th. (A very elegant soft wool coat with a top-quality fox fur upper body, about one-quarter, and top-quality long-haired white lambskin, measuring four feet in length and eight and eight-tenths inches in the waist.)"</p>
<p>Moved by All Circles</p>
<p>Our association cannot help but speak out after reading Gukuyusheng's letter. (1) Mr. Gukuyusheng's family is not wealthy. Over the years, they have been engaged in cultural undertakings. Although he is a businessman, he aims to benefit society. His sons are all self-sufficient. Mr. Gukuyusheng embraces the spirit of service and does not prioritize profit. Therefore, it is to be expected that his business cannot obtain high profits, or rather, that he does not desire to obtain high profits. (2) Since the third session, Mr. Gukuyusheng has donated or solicited a total of ten thousand yuan in scholarship funds anonymously. Society hardly knows who Mr. Gukuyusheng is, and Mr. Gukuyusheng does not want society to hear about it. In addition, he has donated clothing and bedding, and has generously helped in almost every case where this newspaper has appealed for assistance. How could he have donated just a limited amount of scholarship funds? (3) Given Mr. Gukuyusheng's advanced age and high virtue, under these circumstances, in the opinion of most people in society, he does not need to donate this only fox fur coat. However, Mr. Gukuyusheng lives modestly, with simple food and clothing, and cares deeply about others, feeling their hunger and suffering. He feels pain at not being able to fully donate to the scholarship fund. His noble and pure spirit of benevolence and love for students is enough to influence the world. (4) Leaders from various industries in the business world, over the past year, may not have obtained abundant profits, but they must be better off than Mr. Gukuyusheng. Now that Mr. Gukuyusheng has taken this righteous action, people from all walks of life should be deeply moved. (5) A gentleman loves others with virtue, while a petty person loves others with indulgence. Since Mr. Gukuyusheng has made this grand wish, we should fulfill his ambition to establish virtue. Although there is no precedent, we should follow suit. Readers who wish to purchase the coat, please contact the scholarship fund collection office.</p>
<p>Liliping Assists Education</p>
<p>In addition, Gongye, a colleague in this newspaper, is over seventy years old and an outstanding calligrapher. Every inch of his paper is treasured. Recently, countless requests have been made by celebrities at home and abroad, so he has set up rules to limit them slightly. Now, to support the scholarship campaign, he has specially created four couplets in the Li script and sent them to the association for sale, donating all proceeds to the scholarship fund. The price is set at two hundred yuan. Those who love Gongye's calligraphy will surely understand his wish to do good and assist education and will rush to order them.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The scholarship funds received yesterday totaled 200 yuan from Li Caiji, 200 yuan from Li Shugong, 100 yuan from Shi Zhenhua, 50 yuan from Chen Shufan, 4 yuan from Ju [omission], 20 yuan from Wang Shushan, 10 yuan each from Cao Juqing, Sun Zemin, Wu [omission], Cui Guanglin, Zhu Wensen, Ma [omission]fang, Cen Lesi, Tang Zihui, Song Zhaohui, Wu Baichun, and Chu Zhiyi, 5 yuan each from Cen Lemin, Cen Lesan Kang Shiyuan, Wang [omission]ling, Cao Chiyang, Han Cuihe, [omission] Qiyu, and Zheng Xianhua, for a total of 744 Central Reserve Certificates.

<h3>Pancake and Fried Dough Stick Industry Bitterly Expresses Their Plight – Appealing for the Restoration of Flour Rationing – More Than Three Thousand Shops Rely on it for Business – Fifteen Thousand Workers Rely on it for a Living</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cake, Noodle, and Fried Dough Stick Industry Allied Benefit Association respectfully submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that the Council change the exchange method and restore flour rationing as usual to maintain livelihoods. The document stated, "We have carefully read the announcement made by your Council on the 31st of the 2nd month of the 31st year, [omission] changing the flour rationing method.</p>
<p>All flour-based foods will adopt an exchange system, where citizens exchange flour or flour certificate coupons for flour-based products to prevent unscrupulous merchants from profiting. The intention is excellent. However, your Council believes that this method can benefit both supply and demand when implemented, but there are some unforeseen consequences. We respectfully present the facts as follows: The members of our association all make and sell pancakes, flatbreads, fried pancakes, and fried dough sticks. There are more than three thousand such businesses in the two concessions in total (over one thousand four hundred registered, over one thousand unregistered). They are registered with the flour rationing office of your Council and receive flour rationing on a regular basis for production. Their selling prices and profits comply with the standards and quantities stipulated by your Council and are sold at limited prices, without any violations. The citizens are also comfortable with the custom, and our industry has been able to maintain a minimum standard of living. However, with three thousand businesses in the two concessions, each employing five people, more than fifteen thousand people rely on this for their livelihood. The laboring class works from sunrise to sunset. For the sake of convenience and economy, they have always relied on pancakes and fried dough sticks to satisfy their hunger. Since [omission] they travel and are constantly on the move, their diet is simple and convenient. Carrying flour is inconvenient, and the exchange system is unfamiliar. These are all traditional habits of the Chinese lower class,</p>
<p>that cannot be corrected overnight. Based on the above factors, since the trial implementation of the exchange system, in less than twenty days, more than half of our businesses have been forced to close because no one is exchanging flour for products. The remaining businesses that have not closed are producing and selling with the little flour they have left over from ordinary business. However, within five days, their remaining flour will be used up, and they will inevitably close down one after another. The general laboring class, lacking pancakes and fried dough sticks, affordable foods to eat, is also deeply troubled by the time and expense. Sighs can be heard everywhere. Therefore, your Council only needs to send staff to patrol the urban area for a week to understand the mutually distressed situation between our industry and the laborers. This is contrary to your Council's purpose of benefiting the people. Our association, seeing that more than ten thousand workers are on the brink of destitution after the closure of businesses and that our industry is mostly small-scale operations without the financial resources to dismiss these people and send them home, reluctantly presents our plight. We earnestly request that your Council show compassion and promptly change the exchange system and restore flour rationing as usual for production, so that workers and laborers can all receive blessings. We await your urgent orders."</p>

<p>Recently, a shocking burglary occurred in a certain place in the Public Concession. The details learned by this reporter are recorded below:</p>
<p>Servant Conspires with Driver to Steal from Master</p>
<p>Jiang Yunsheng, 24 years old, from Tongzhou, has been working as a shop employee in a certain place in the Public Concession. His fellow villager, Zhao Honghui, 35 years old, has also been working as a carriage driver there for years and has been trusted by his master on weekdays. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, Jiang Yunsheng and Zhao Honghui suddenly had malicious intentions and took the opportunity to conspire and sneak into the inner room to steal their employer's money, gold bars, and valuable jewelry, worth a total of 270,000 National Currency, and fled with the stolen goods without a trace.</p>
<p>The Owner Discovers the Theft and Reports for Investigation</p>
<p>When the owner discovered that the secretly stored gold bars, banknotes, and valuable jewelry had disappeared, he also found that his shop employee Jiang Yunsheng and carriage driver Zhao Honghui had also abandoned their jobs and disappeared. Only then did he realize that the stolen gold bars and jewelry were undoubtedly stolen by the two of them. Therefore, he reported the photos of Jiang and Zhao to the police station and requested an investigation. At the same time, he investigated the guarantors of Jiang and Zhao to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>Police Department Issued a Circular for Arrest Yesterday</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched officers to the address to conduct an inspection and launched a thorough arrest, but the case has not yet been solved.

<h3>Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks Gradually Stabilize, but Some Still Show Upward Momentum, Holders Refuse to Release</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market situation, after six consecutive days of sharp rises, gradually stabilized, turning into a fluctuating situation. However, there was inevitably some buying interest remaining. If ten stocks continued to advance upwards and reached high prices, those holding the stocks would slightly release them. A few stocks showed a slight downward trend. According to the current trend, there is a possibility of continued fluctuations. The buying interest in Nanyang Tobacco Company has not subsided, rising further to $128.50, and further gains may be difficult. Great China Match also rose by about one dollar, reaching $326-27. Department stores were the most stable, with Lihua Company at $340, with limited supply relative to demand. Wing On Company rose by $0.75 to $132.75, Sincere at $142, and National Goods Company at $76.50, all being the noon closing prices. In the textile industry, Dasheng No. 1 Factory had buyers at $420, and No. 3 Factory remained at $360-70. Wing On Spinning Mill was flat and weak between $335 and $340. Trading in Meiya new shares was quite active, reaching a high price of $31.50. Although Rongfeng Dyeing and Weaving could maintain, it was still difficult to reverse the weakness, trading between $35 and $36. Sanyou Industrial's transaction price was between $150 and $155. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing fell again to $18. Great China Weaving rose to the $10 mark, and Daguangming also held firm at $12.25, while Hongxing remained at $8.50. The decline in the cultural industry was the most significant, with China Bookstore dropping to a low of $182.50, down $7.50, and World dropping to $114, down $3.50. Commercial Press was the only one flat, remaining at $465. In the new pharmaceutical industry, only Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory rose by $0.25 to $25. The remaining, such as Sino-French at $27.25 and Xinyi at $247.50, all showed weakness. Wuzhou was flat at $660, Minyi at $62.50, and Sino-Western at $435. The transaction price of Guohua Bank was between $175 and $170. Public utilities were the most stagnant, with Zhabei Water and Electricity at $65-66 and China Electric at $45-46, both being entry and exit prices. Other stocks also turned flat and weak, with relatively active trading.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Buying Interest Does Not Decline Due to Tight Credit</h3>
<p>Yesterday's public bond market suddenly had a formal change in trend. As a result of competition between buyers and sellers, the buyers prevailed. Although credit is tight, there is no concern about it. It can be seen that those with loose credit are loose, and those with tight credit are slightly tight. The reason is probably mostly due to environmental factors. For example, Class C started at $1.40 and immediately rose to $2.00. Then, the sellers tried to struggle, exerting the final pressure, and fell back slightly to a little over $1.00. However, it soon rose again to $1.80-90. In the end, there were buyers outside of $2.00, but no sellers. The situation has changed, and the market can be optimistic. Other types also rose, with Class A trading at $1.45, Class B trading around $1.00, Class D trading at $9.70-80, and Class E trading at $50.05-06. It is heard that the suppliers are urging repayment very tightly, which is probably also a major reason.</p>
<h3>Military Note Settlement Becomes Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was 17%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Japanese military notes have fallen back. The interbank trading price is less than $5.5535, a slight decrease. The settlement has been cleared. The retail price sold by small money shops and banks has retreated to $5.56, and the purchase price is still $5.55. Joint Reserve Bank notes are $0.02 lower. Operators sell them for $3.75 and buy them for $3.70.</p>
<h3>Small Consignment Notes for Woolen Fabrics Have Not Yet Resumed Issuance</h3>
<p>Since the authorities stipulated that the sale and purchase of woolen fabrics in this city requires an application to the Xingya Academy for a large consignment note for the transportation of one or more pieces, and a small consignment note for less than one piece, before they can be freely transported within the concession area, the authorities have temporarily suspended the issuance of both large and small consignment notes for more than 20 days in order to prevent abuses. This has caused difficulties in delivery and shipment among the industry. Recently, railway consignment notes have been restored by the authorities, but small consignment notes have not yet been issued, which is very inconvenient for the industry's sales and purchases. According to past practices, the application procedure for large consignment notes is more complicated because it requires the approval of the Xingya Academy. The application procedure for small consignment notes is relatively simple. Therefore, most merchants are willing to choose the simple over the complex and apply for small consignment notes. In addition, the current price of woolen fabrics is high, and the number of pieces traded between the industry is extremely small. There is no need to apply for large consignment notes for transportation. Therefore, most woolen fabric merchants hope that the issuance of small woolen fabric consignment notes will be restored.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Desolate</h3>
<p>The cloth market this morning still had high asking prices, and transactions were extremely rare, so the market was desolate. Si Junzi serge started at $9.55 and was quoted as high as $9.68. At noon, it returned to $9.64, an increase of $0.09 from yesterday. Longtou fine cloth was quoted by banks at $241.</p>
<h3>British and American Cigarettes Decline Sharply; Large Quantities of Cigarettes Will Be Appropriately Rationed</h3>
<p>Cigarette prices fluctuated greatly yesterday. The prices of various brands fell sharply like a straight line in the morning, causing speculators to be sometimes happy and sometimes worried. This is because there are still shipments of British and American goods within the abolished lunar year, so people are nervous. At the opening, brands such as Great Britain plunged to 10,500 yuan, and then rose to 11,300 yuan, a difference of 800 yuan. Old Knife brand briefly traded below 9,500 yuan and then closed at 10,000 yuan. Pin Hai brand was 7,400 yuan, and Wu Hua brand was 6,400 yuan. As a result, the price was 400-500 yuan lower than the previous day. Fairy brand was 7,900 yuan, unchanged. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Spear brand was 3,000 yuan, Red Rose was 2,650 yuan, Golden Building was 3,700 yuan, Quanlu brand was 3,450 yuan, Nianzhi was 3,100 yuan, and Zhizhi brand was 2,700 yuan, all slightly higher by about 100 yuan. The rise of national cigarettes was slow and the fall was also slow. The prices of Pyramid, Beautiful Spleen, Golden Mouse, Platinum Dragon, and Golden Dragon showed little change.</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources, the continuous surge in cigarette prices in the past was due to two reasons: one was the approach of the end of the lunar year, and the other was the reorganization of the rationing agency, which caused a slight delay in the rationing work. Recently, the reorganization of the agency is about to be completed, and a large number of cigarettes are available for appropriate rationing by the new organization. Therefore, cigarette prices will soon stabilize.</p>
<h3>Matches Also Fall Rapidly</h3>
<p>The match market retreated sharply. Phoenix brand was trading at 3,600 yuan, Beautiful brand at 3,800 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 3,200 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,150 yuan, a drop of 300-400 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Transformation of Japanese Textile Industry</h3>
<p>The Japanese textile industry, which has long held the leading position in Japan's light industry and occupies an absolute position in the world's textile industry, has been changing its traditional face to adapt to the times since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War following the China Incident. Since the raw cotton that was once supplied by enemy countries has been cut off, and the domestic industry has shifted its focus to military demand, the Japanese textile industry is currently proceeding in the following two ways: one is to seek raw materials within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the other is to organize textile equipment in order to actively shift its full strength to production that is suitable for the times. Therefore, recently, the increase in cotton production in North China, the development of cotton in the southern occupied areas, the advancement of equipment overseas, the reinvestment of domestic textile capital in industries suitable for the situation, and the removal of factory equipment have all become quite apparent. The current situation, viewed separately by each company, is as described on the left. Now that the Greater East Asia War is nearing the decisive stage, and the ultra-focus production of domestic industries is being demanded, this trend in the textile industry will be further strengthened.</p>
<p>Japan Textile Co.: A total of 30,000 spindles of textile machines from the Kagoshima Factory have recently been completely moved to Shanghai. It is also paying attention to North China, and is working to increase cotton production to establish a long-term plan, and is strengthening the Tianjin and Qingdao factories. It has also dispatched technicians to Celebes and the Philippines to start developing cotton farming. In addition, the company's Kishiwada No. 1 Factory and Tsudajima and other idle factories are now being used as soldier schools, training centers and other military control agencies. On the other hand, in mainland China, it operates China Brewery, Tianjin Paper Mill, Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, etc. as its affiliated companies.</p>
<p>Toyo Spinning Co.: The equipment of the Osone Spinning Factory belonging to the company has been moved to Shanghai: cotton farming is being carried out in Celebes and the Philippines: cloth factories and spinning factories have been established in Java and Carro Island: and burnt grass is operated in Carro Island and Hong Kong, and rubber business is also operated in Shonan Island (i.e. Singapore). The dormitories of the three factories in Osaka, Sibao Island, Nishinari, and Sanya have been used by Osaka Iron Works and Sumitomo Metal Industries.</p>
<p>Kanebo Spinning Co.: It is currently planning to move its machinery and equipment to expand its eight factories in China; in the southern Philippines and Celebes, a cotton farming headquarters has been established, and its director, Fukunaga Mizuta, and others have begun to be active.</p>

<p>Soap prices are rising daily. For example, Guben soap has continued to rise to 750 yuan per box, Baixiangmao soap is 700 yuan, Huangxiangmao is 650 yuan, and Scissors soap is 720 yuan, a huge increase of 30-40 yuan.</p>
<p>Paraffin candles are gradually falling back in price. Because supply and demand are roughly equal, the market atmosphere has changed from strong to weak. Price for Bell brand candles is 550 yuan, Monk's Cap brand candles is 480 yuan, and miscellaneous brand candles is 320 yuan, continuing to fall back from the previous day.</p>
<p>Drug prices are following suit, rising and falling, entirely dependent on the rise and fall of cigarette prices. Yesterday, Bagua Dan opened at 38 yuan, Wan Jin You at 43 yuan, Headache Powder at 37 yuan, Partridge Vegetables at 57.5 yuan, and Dragon and Tiger Ren Dan at 30 yuan, all slightly down from before.</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Initially Firm, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market was still limited to bean cake transactions. People's minds were peaceful, and the market showed a trend of initially rising and then falling back. Kaiyuanlong bean cake opened three cars, priced at 94.25 yuan to 93.75 yuan. Feizi bean cake opened two cars, priced at 94.25 yuan to 93.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Born in Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Ji Xiaoshang</p>
<p>After buying Mr. Xinsheng's "Re-examining Su Qin," I couldn't help but think of the ancient saying, "Born in sorrow, dies in peace."</p>
<p>There is also a Western saying: "Moderate poverty is enough to stimulate people to work hard." It can be seen that poverty and hardship are not only not bad things, but can also make people work hard and achieve something. However, if a person is content to be poor all his life and does not think about development, then that is another matter.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "When Heaven is about to assign a great task to a person, it must first afflict his mind, exhaust his muscles..." These words must be familiar to everyone. Therefore, a person's comfortable enjoyment in his youth is actually an obstacle to hard work and progress. Poor children do not need to envy them!</p>
<p>"Poverty is no worse than lack of talent, and baseness is no worse than lack of ambition." It is not sad to be born into poverty; there is no need to sigh at being born in sorrow. As long as you have ambition, as long as you can work hard, then poverty and hardship are enough to temper your mind and body, so that we can obtain future peace and happiness.</p>
<p>You reap what you sow. If Su Qin hadn't pricked his thigh with an awl at that time and worked hard, how could he have achieved such achievements later?</p>
<h3>The Uncle Ping Public Scholarship, a Model for Learning</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>The high prices have greatly threatened the lives of ordinary people. For those who maintain their families with salaries, it is already difficult to have three meals a day. If they have to bear the cost of their children's education, it is even more difficult. Many promising young people have to drop out of school under the pressure of economic difficulties, which is a major loss to society. Therefore, rescuing young people from dropping out of school is a very urgent problem. Many enthusiastic people in society have established scholarships and grants to provide sincere assistance to poor students, so that their access to education has a guarantee. What I want to introduce here is the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship.</p>
<p>The Uncle Ping Public Scholarship was established in 1938 and has been held for six sessions. The organizer is Mr. Gu Qianlin, a descendant of Uncle Ping. Mr. Gu has inherited his ancestor's wishes and has spared no effort in promoting compulsory education. The Uncle Ping Public Scholarship aims to support outstanding students whose families are indeed poor and unable to afford education. Therefore, the selection of scholarship recipients is extremely strict. Applicants must have academic achievements above 85 points, excellent conduct, and be confirmed to be poor after investigation of their family situation before they are allowed to participate in the examination. At the same time, it should be noted that students who have already received grants or scholarships from other places cannot receive the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship again. They are very serious about the work of investigating family circumstances, braving the wind and cold in winter and the scorching sun in summer, running around and not being afraid of hardship. This spirit of enthusiasm for social affairs is truly admirable.</p>
<p>The scholarship provides tuition fees for the admitted students. Students with good grades also receive book fees. The scholarship pays close attention to the students' studies and stipulates that students must submit a monthly report on their academic status before the 10th of each month, reporting their learning experiences and living conditions. This not only urges students to study hard, but also allows them to know the students' living conditions. As for students with particularly good academic performance, with an overall average of over 95 points, there is also a scholarship for board and lodging expenses for one semester. From this, it can be seen that the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship is enthusiastic about supporting poor students.</p>
<p>In addition, the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship also invites famous doctors to examine the students' health and provide free treatment, so that the students' health can be guaranteed, so as to avoid suffering from illness. Therefore, the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship not only helps students solve the problem of entering school, but also tries its best to help students solve the pain in life, so that they can study with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Young students are the pillars of the country. Cultivating young people is cultivating the essence of the country. Although rescuing poor students to enter school is a difficult task, its significance is positive and its contribution to society is great. Mr. Gu Qianlin, the organizer of the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship, can dedicate all his spirit, precious time and money to the great work of rescuing poor students, which is rare in society. I hope that wealthy people in society can also emulate Mr. Gu's spirit of enthusiastic service and do more things that are beneficial to society. I have never known Mr. Gu and his son, and the purpose of writing this article is entirely voluntary, only to admire his spirit of helping students. I am now handling the work of the newspaper's reader scholarship and will work harder and more faithfully to serve. (Scholarship for helping the poor)</p>
<h3>Drive Out the British and Americans and Give Me Freedom</h3>
<h3>Outpost on the Enemy Shore</h3>
<p>— Tianmingshu</p>
<h3>Model for All Generations</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yijin</p>
<p>She was a good player, and a graceful musician. Caldcote would wear fur and mufflers, attending the house matches in December; Caldcote would give advice at speech day garden-parties, Caldicote on any little matter that arose. Good advice, too—he didn't always take it, but it generally influenced him.</p>
<p>"Chips, my dear, if I were you I should let them off. After all, it's not very serious."</p>
<p>"I know, and I'd like to let them off, but if I do, I'm afraid they'll do it again."</p>
<p>"Try telling them frankly and giving them a chance."</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>Occasionally there were really serious matters.</p>
<p>"You know, Chips, locking up several hundred boys here is really Nature's own arrangement, you only have to think. Therefore, if things that shouldn't happen do happen, to blame them for it as if it were all their fault that they were here, don't you think that's a little unfair?"</p>
<p>"I don't know about that, Kathie, but I do know that for the sake of the rest we ought to be fairly severe over things of that sort. One black sheep does corrupt the others."</p>
<p>"Always provided he's been corrupt before. After all, that may be exactly what's going to happen, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Maybe. We can't help that. Anyhow, I believe Brookfield's a good deal better than some other schools. That's all the more reason--"</p>
<p>"But this boy, Chips... you mean to expel him?"</p>
<p>"The Head'll expel him, if I tell him."</p>
<p>"Must you tell the Head?"</p>
<p>"I think it's my duty."</p>
<p>"Can't you think it over... talk to the boy again... find out how it started... after all, apart from this—isn't he a good boy?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he's all right."</p>
<p>"Well then, dear Chips, can't you think of some other way?" (16) Tianmingshu</p>
<h3>Re-evaluating Li Shaochun's "Washing Floating Mountain"</h3>
<p>— Huilin</p>
<p>Li Shaochun's third-day performance was "Washing Floating Mountain," "personally taught by Yu Shuyan" (quoted from the advertisement). Before it was Bai Yuwei and Gao Weilian's "Satisfactory Marriage," which was said to be "personally taught by Xiao Cuihua." Although I don't expect them to truly learn it to the fullest, I would be very satisfied if they could get one or two points of its essence.</p>
<p>Rushing to the Tianchan Theater, Wang Bansheng was singing those few shaking board lines. Ai Shiju's performance was not wonderful. His voice was not bright, and his ad-libs were also poor and vulgar. I always felt that his comic roles were not as good as his martial comic roles. Bansheng couldn't catch the White Fox Immortal, so he brought Guan Ping and Zhou Cang to subdue the demons. Xiao Deyin, who played Zhou Cang, was good at spitting fire, grabbing his beard, and waist and leg skills. Unfortunately, Ma Honglin's Guan Ping was not very good. On this day, Ban Shichao was particularly energetic, but he used fewer moves and wanted more guns and whips, which inevitably seemed to be covering up his shortcomings, and also made people feel relaxed. In short, in the play "Qingshi Mountain," in addition to Lu Dongbin, the martial women, clowns, martial students, and painted faces all had roles to play. Especially the satire of Wang Bansheng, writing the gods and demons so humanly (referring to the several body movements of Zhou Cang, etc., which are all worthy of our praise).</p>
<p>Then, there was Bai Yuwei's "Satisfactory Marriage." This is also a very interesting and good play among the female roles. Unfortunately, Bai Yuwei was too poor. Her appearance was vulgar, her body was stiff, and her speech was not clear. From any aspect, she couldn't see any shadow of Xiao Cuihua. I especially disliked her singing, which was tasteless, didn't fit the strings, and at the end, she had to suddenly raise her voice and tremble like she had malaria. It was thanks to the erhu that could match her, and also followed like a saw. Surprisingly, there were still people cheering, which was even more absurd. The only thing worth watching was Gao Weilian's Lu Kunjie. His speech, singing, and acting were all right, and from beginning to end, only he was seen acting. Our "Xiao Cuihua" was instead overshadowed. However, because he was too focused on acting, these places were inevitably overdone. It is true that "Satisfactory Marriage" is a joke play, and there is no need to pay attention to what is reasonable or unreasonable, but the ad-libs must be just right. Crying loudly and rolling on the ground seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, "Washing Floating Mountain" was on stage. The first to come up was Mao Qinglai's Huang Tianba. His appearance and the posture of riding a horse were not bad. After seeing the heads, he stood still and walked towards the upstage door, in a very stylized posture. Unfortunately, the second time he came out, he twisted a whirlwind at the downstage door, which was too low. When Li Shaochun came out, the audience responded with a full house of applause. Li's popularity seemed to be even greater than Baosen's, for some reason. This play is touted as the Yu School. The beginning does have some of the stability of an old male role performing a martial play, but after entering and fighting with the bandit soldiers, he stole a lot of moves, and the opening fight with the subordinates was particularly fierce. Are these all Yu Shuyan's style? I couldn't help but deeply doubt it. When He died and appeared in a dream to He Renjie, the few erhuang counter melodies had the flavor of Yu Shuyan, but the oral strength and mellowness were too far from Yu Shuyan's realm.</p>
<p>Looking at the results this time, Li's martial arts are indeed very impressive, but I really dare not praise his singing. I think Shaochun himself is not unaware of this, which is confirmed by the fact that he performs more plays like Sun Wukong and Golden Leopard. But since his strength is in martial arts, he should put more effort into it privately, arrange more body movements, and learn a few more martial student plays. If you want to specialize in the beard role, that's also fine. Then you must never put the two generals and Guchao's beating the drum together to sing. It must be known that "versatile in both civil and martial arts" refers to old male roles who have a martial arts foundation. According to Li Shaochun's materials, he has martial arts, and his voice is wide and bright, but he just lacks some daily strength. As long as he puts in more effort, it will not be difficult to reach this point in the future. This is definitely not telling you to be Yu Shuyan and also Xiao Lou. I hope Shaochun will think twice!</p>

<h3>My Suggestions for Winter Relief</h3>
<p>— Rong Boyun</p>
<p>The time for winter relief is already pressing, so it is extremely urgent to organize a joint association of charitable organizations. To this end, I am calling on all sectors of society and proposing the following methods. I will briefly explain my humble opinion for my comrades to adopt.</p>
<p>(1) Benefits of Organizing a Joint Association of Winter Relief Charitable Organizations: The disadvantages of charitable organizations not being connected and cooperating are threefold: 1. Weak manpower results in a narrow scope of work and higher expenses; 2. Unsustainable organization makes it difficult to gain social trust and support from the majority; 3. The distribution of money and goods is concentrated in bustling areas, while the poor in remote areas are mostly left out, resulting in uneven distribution of hardship and happiness. After organizing the joint association, talents can be concentrated, fundraising can be divided and assigned, and relief distribution can be divided by region. The aforementioned three disadvantages can be avoided. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, we should immediately publish an announcement in the newspaper to convene all relevant winter relief charitable organizations and enthusiastic public welfare people from the industrial and commercial sectors to organize the establishment of a general office for the joint association. Each organization should elect enthusiastic people to preside over everything to promote progress and complete the relief mission.</p>
<p>(2) Methods of Fundraising: (A) If fundraising relies solely on automatic donations from all sectors of society, we can only awaken the wealthy to make everyone understand that contributing money to help the poor is a great and worthy act. The benefits will not only go to the poor, but the donor and their descendants will receive good rewards that are multiplied a hundred or a thousand times compared to the amount donated. This is true savings. Ordinary savings left to descendants are often not guaranteed. This kind of savings is one hundred and twenty percent reliable. (B) The relief association should submit a request to the authorities to approve the entrustment of all Baojia offices in the city to solicit relief donations from each household (one residence is counted as one household) on a voluntary basis. Each household should be required to donate 20 yuan from their New Year's food budget for winter relief expenses. The Baojia offices will collect and remit the funds to the relief association. Based on the total population of 4 million in Shanghai, with every 40 people forming one household, there would be 100,000 households, and the income should be 2 million yuan. The total donations from items A and B may reach 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>(3) Survey Steps for Relief Distribution: To make the survey procedures quick and universal, we should also entrust all Baojia offices in Shanghai to do it voluntarily. Provide emergency relief to the homeless and gradual relief to the hidden poor. The homeless originally have no household registration, so they should be given tickets stating "〇〇 Bao Homeless Person No. 〇〇 with name, gender and age", so that they can claim the relief based on the ticket, which is fair and universal. The survey should be conducted by all Baojia offices in Shanghai on the same day and at the same time. If the authorities can assist by cutting off all traffic in Shanghai for half an hour, it would be even better to prevent one person from registering in two places to obtain two homeless certificates.</p>
<p>(4) Headquarters for Collection and Custody of Property: It should be located at a suitable place to establish the General Office of the Shanghai Charitable Organization Joint Association. The responsibility for income and expenditure accounting and custody should be undertaken by voluntary personnel appointed by the Accountants Association.</p>
<p>If the above four items can be handled properly step by step, the poor and needy will benefit more than usual at present, and the Relief Association can still move further and move towards a more active path, engaging in reclamation and production and opening factories and other enterprises for thorough relief. This is the great fortune of the poor in Shanghai and also a major issue for improving society. Are these humble words feasible? I respectfully ask all benevolent leaders to make a public decision.</p>
<h3>Compendium of Free and Reduced-Fee Schools</h3>
<p>(2) Ji Ying Primary and Secondary School at No. 668, Yu Yuan Road, will hire more teachers and expand its school buildings next semester. The existing free and reduced-fee places will be greatly expanded.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of the Zili Girls' School is to popularize education and provide relief to out-of-school girls. No tuition fees are charged. Miscellaneous fees are 10 yuan for the junior high school department and 8 yuan for the primary school department. A deposit of 10 yuan is required. Classes are held from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm, offering more than ten subjects such as Chinese, Applied Writing, Japanese, English, Bookkeeping, Mathematics, and Home Economics.</p>
<p>(4) Jiancheng Primary and Secondary School at Da Tong Road Intersection has donated more than 20,000 yuan in student loans to assist needy students next semester, starting this semester, and has obtained the sympathy of students' parents to provide dozens of free places.</p>
<h3>Children's Library</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library reported that the number of children reading in December was 4,039. The number of books borrowed was 4,654. In order to facilitate children's borrowing, in addition to setting up three book circulation stations and fourteen group borrowing points, there are also two mobile library carts that serve street children in various places. The address of the library is No. 13, Dahua Shopping Mall, No. 1040, Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Hiring Japanese Translators</h3>
<p>The editorial department of this newspaper is hiring several Japanese translators to specialize in translating texts of political, economic, literary, and educational nature. The translation must be fluent, accurate, and quick. Working hours are from 6 pm to 12 am. Accommodation is provided, but not meals. The monthly salary is 800 yuan (no cost-of-living allowance). Those who are willing to apply should prepare a resume and a sample translation (with the original text) and send it to the Chief Editor's office of this newspaper. Suitable candidates will receive a special letter.</p>
