<p>社評</p>
<h3>敬祝沈高先生八秩大壽</h3>
<p>時勢艱危，國事　，我們沒有爲任何個人寫歌頌文章的情緒。但是，今日對於沈信卿，高翰卿二先生的八十大壽，却有表示敬賀的必要，並願特別喚起國人之注意。因爲兩先生之大壽，和我國文化事業的關係非常密切，兩先生的大壽，顯示我國文化事業前途光明的象徵！</p>
<p>信卿先生的道德文章，用不到輿論界的傳揚，早已在國人心目中留有深刻的印象。我們認爲特別値得敬重的，是他個人的道德文章以外的兩件大事業。第一，是不屈不撓努力扶助的敎育事業，自民國以前倡辦龍鬥書院，革命以後主持江蘇省敎育會，以至提倡廣開講座，在中國民族啟蒙運動史上，建立光榮的業績。尤其是自民國六年以後，信卿先生與黃任之先生鑒於民國建設之特殊需要，提倡職業敎育，在「使無業者有業，」「使有業者　業」的宗旨之下，創辦「中華職業敎育社」，二十餘年以來，在全國各地，造就了不少脚踏實地爲國家爲社會服務的專門人才。「職業委敎育」和　手萬能「之聲，洋溢全國。古人說：「一言可以興邦」，而信卿先生則不僅倡言，並且實踐不懈，誨人不倦，這種精神，定將萬壽無疆。第二，努力推行圖書館事業。信卿先生於民十三年與知友創設」甲子社」，搜輯現代史料，進而擴充爲「人文圖書館」，更得葉鴻英先生之助而宏其規模，以有今日著名全國的「鴻英圖書館」信卿先生主持其事，二十年來，每白到館，雖風雨寒暑無間，至今以八十高年，猶策杖從公，無名無利，人或未恐擺脫之不速，信卿先生獨「知其不可爲而爲之」，這種精神，殊値我們後輩的敬佩！而對於民衆敎育與中國文化事業之助益，實已不能用任何尺度來估量了！信卿先生早年曾一度爲本報編輯「常識」版，增益靑年智慧者良多，初不僅增高本報聲譽而巳。</p>
<p>翰卿先生是一位篤誠信實的基督敎徒，以其宗敎家專誠不二的精神，努力於文化事業。先生在卅餘年前，鑒於中國近代文化事業特別是出版事業之落後，成爲國家貧弱的一大主因，因此，與張菊生前輩與已故夏粹芳先生創辦商務印書館，蔚爲我國最大的出版事業之一。翰卿先生更專心經營，雖環境迭有變遷，人事閱盡滄桑，仍孜孜兀兀，始終忠於該館事業，誠未有一日或移。這種畢生盡瘁於事業之精神，並不爲了該館本身，實際是爲了整個中國出版界的利益，也就是爲了供應全國人民以精神食糧。</p>
<p>今天，喜逢信卿先生的八秩大慶，與旬以後，（本月二十日）又逢翰卿先生八秩華誕，我們如何慶賀這兩位文化界偉人，如何表示我們對這位中國文化界元勛的敬禮呢？據日前報載，由於二老生平都不主張做壽，對於信卿先生，各界朋友已經決定遵奉先生素志，移公祝觴酒之資，以充鴻英圖書館的經費，「壽人壽世，長留紀念」，實在是最合理也最可博得先生歡欣的好辦法。對於翰卿先生，日前亦已有各界名流發起公祝，先生且先慨捐萬元以爲北方振災之用，並聲明拒收禮物，如獻現金，則一併捐賑，所謂「共成善願，永留慈澤」，同樣是最滴時宜的慶賀辦法。我們除了希望各界朋友，善體二老之心，共申「壽人壽世」之祝之外，竊體二老平日熱心文化敎育事業之恒心與莊嚴的態度，希望各界協助鴻英圖書館的規模更加宏大起來，成爲東亞最完善最豐富的圖書府，使對天下貧士廣開方便之門，我們申希望信卿先生二十餘年來志趣所在的「敬業樂業」的職業敎育運動，有更普遍更深人的發展，替中華民族將來的新建設培養千千萬萬的人村；我們更希望翰卿先生數十年來經營不懈的商務印書館迅速恢復出版新書，繼續並且更進一步爲全國學生與專家供應取用不竭的精神食糧。我們敬以祝賀二老之心，期待着無數千萬繼二老而起的文化界的偉人！</p>
<h3>中國出版事業復與之曙光</h3>
<p>中國文化之奔流，不幸在這六七年中，因戰爭之拖延，受了阻遏。它是停滯了，它是消沈了！然而這實在是一種表面的微象。中國人民大衆，都能明白，一國文化的熱流，決不會眞的突然停滯，它自有一種潛在的力量，每個人的中心，仍或深或淺，或多或少，要求有文化生活的涵育。文化熱流的本質，旣具有「抽刀斷水水更流」的性能，人民對於文化生活的要求，更具有一種於飢餓中尋求食物的趨勢。因此中國文化之趨於復興，乃是必然的定論。</p>
<p>言一國之民族文化，學者大概析爲十端。一曰文史，二曰政治，三曰經濟，四曰科學，五曰哲學，六曰倫理，七曰宗敎，八曰工藝，九曰美術，十曰人物。就文化之內容言，大體不過如此。在這裏，我們所要進一步指出的，這分析的十端，是立體而活動的事物。將此事物，記以文字，傳之久遠的，便是書籍。換句話說，民族文化，爲民族生活結晶之物，而吸受此結晶物，以楮墨之材料，文字之形式，製爲書籍，遠布而久傳的，便是出版界唯一的事業，唯一的責任了。</p>
<p>中國自前淸勵行新政以來，全國文化中心，一在北京，一在上海，北京爲中國固有文物保存集聚之所，而上海則爲新文化彙集放射之所。換言之，亦即北京多文物與人才，而上海則爲出版事業之總滙。自中日事變以後，在戰火蔓延之實際環境下，出版事業之消沈，實爲不可避免之必然現象。此一現象之急宜挽救，母使延續，亦爲國內有識人士共同之意見。然而過去六七年來，上海出版事業，終于歷長久之時間，消沈不振者，推其原因，第一是印刷材料極端缺乏，平均價格，皆在戰前百倍以上，其中尤以紙張價格之高漲爲最甚。第二是物價飛漲，生活困苦。那爲出版事車業中心之文化人，或流離顚沛，或辛苦掙扎，實無心力從事著述。這兩個因素，如繼續存在，則出版事業，雖有人熱誠肫意，欲謀復興與推進，實亦難乎其難。</p>
<p>幸而且前出版事業的大轉機，已經來臨了。上海許多著名的出版家，業已本其服務文化之宏願與偉抱，自動集中人力，組織中國聯合出版公司，從事出版事業之恢復與推進。籌備以來，經過數月，定於今日開幕了。在這出版事業衰頹的今日，居然有這樣的一鳴驚人之舉，實在不能不使我們感到萬分的興奮。這許多年來，我們對於出版界的沈寂，一切文化事業的停滯，無日不在苦悶之中，會經大聲疾呼，希望文化人肯出來努力，替中國文化界作最大之奮鬥。現在這出版事業中心的上海，終於集合出版界的人力物力，有這聯合的組織，其對於文化的貢獻，是如何偉大，可以不必再勞我們贊揚了。</p>
<p>我們對於中國聯合出版公司寄予熱烈的期望。我們爲了中國文化事業的復興，希望該公司勿拘拘於營利木位的立塲，而應從國家的立塲，來担負正常的文化使命，推進戰時的文化工作。我們希望各方面的人士，尤其文化人，對該公司加以鼓勵和協助。我們希望社會上的讀者大衆，對該公司之出版物，加以督責，予以推薦。</p>
<p>可是我們所憂慮的，現在印刷原料這樣的缺乏，價格這樣的高漲，書籍的定價，幾於使讀者無法購買。該公司旣然是一種商業的組織，我們當然不能責望它虧了本來經營商業。從根木上設法，不能不請政府當局對於印刷原料，尤其楚紙張的囤積商人，加以嚴厲的制裁。更其希望能仿效友邦日本的政策，對於正當用途的紙張，予以充分的配給。這樣對於中國出版業的前途，對於中國文化的將來，定能有極大的推進力。</p>
<p>最後，我們敬祝中國聯合出版公司前途無量！中國出版事業前途無量！中國文化事業前途無量！</p>

<p>東京三十一日中央社電　阿圖島日守軍一千餘人之壯烈殉國，日本全國上下無不深爲哀悼，而因此打倒英美之決意乃更爲堅强。學校學生有數千人一致向當局請纓殺敵，另有一工廠全體工人亦一致決意努力增加飛機生產，故今日日本後方一億國民，無不敵愾同仇，充滿鬥志，決各就本位，努力誓爲殉國先烈復仇，以擊滅英美。如神奈縣日本大學拓殖科學生一千二百人，及農學豫科生二百人，於卅日晚正在操塲受訓時，突接阿圖島日軍殉國之悲報，無不深爲憤激，當即向科長小松雄道氏請願，全體願以義勇軍資格，開往前綫殺敵。小松科長深爲感動，當即召集全校學生說明此事，並暫停訓練，全體學生旋於下午八時整隊出發，一夜未眠，於卅一晨九時行抵東京，在宮城前遙拜，並宣誓爲殉國先烈復仇後，始整隊返校。旋即在大禮堂召集法科代表學生一千五百人，籲請彼等加入義勇軍共同殺敵，法科學生當即允諾，刻該校學生正在加緊軍事訓練中。關於此事，校方並已與軍部方面進行交涉中。又東京第一高等學校寄舍生，於卅日晚齊集宿舍院中：由宿舍副委昌長報吿阿圖島日守軍壯烈殉國事，全體學生聞悉之餘，深爲悲痛，決踏先烈遺血繼續前進，並合唱「都空」歌，歌畢，全體遙向阿圖島默禱。又日立飛機製造工塲南品川工員寄宿舍工員，於卅日下午五時收音機中，聞悉阿圖島日守軍成仁消息後，全體工員深爲沉痛，均大聲高呼「吾人必報此仇，決盡全力多造飛機，運往前綫助戰」云。是日下午九時全體即遙向阿圖島默禱，並於三十一上午五時全體參拜神社，決意打倒英美增產復仇。又池貝鐵工所田町工塲全體工人，亦決定自三十一起至六月六日止，一週內每日加工小時，將所得津貼完全捐獻陸軍剖，以充軍用。</p>

<h3>法分裂派兩領袖在北非開始談判　邱吉爾曾與李勞作懇談英美兩國野心益見露骨</h3>
<p>瑪德里三十一日中央社電據海通社所獲消息稱：英　相邱吉爾於二十八日在直布羅陀與北非法叛逆領袖季勞會晤，會討論季勞有與特戈雨迅速修好之必要。同時又聞邱吉爾已離直布　陀而赴阿爾及爾，大致係欲親自參加特季兩人之會議，俾在必要時對彼等施用壓力。但關於所傳邱氏赴直布羅陀或阿爾及爾之消息，尙未能自任何官方獲得證實。</p>
<p>尼亞三十一日中央社電　據海通社訊：英首相邱吉爾於本月二十七日與二十八日在直布羅陀進行談話之群情，此間已於昨夜探悉。據消息靈通人士稱，邱吉爾於二十七日晚間乘飛機自華盛頓抵直布羅陀，季勞將軍已先期自北菲抵直港。邱季二氏會晤後，立即開始談判，英國高級官員亦參加，討論解決季勞將軍與特戈爾將軍之爭端。海通社記者自可靠方面探悉，當時邱吉爾向季勞力言與倫敦法國國民委員會領袖，迅速商定辦法之必要，賈德魯將軍，英美軍繼司令艾森霍華將軍·北菲副總司令亞歷山大將軍·及英第八軍軍長蒙特高茂萊將軍均參加。未來軍事行動問題及劃分北菲英美勢力範圍問題殆已討論。因此邱吉爾前往直布羅陀，被視爲羅邱會談之直接結果。</p>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電　特戈爾到達阿爾及爾後，發表正式文吿稱：特季兩氏所計劃之談判，將於今日下午二時開始舉行，季勞宣言渠歡迎特氏之來臨，因爲法國利益計，極願兩派人士之團結一致也。特戈爾抵阿爾及爾時頗守秘密，故市民並無任何表示，在機塲歡迎特氏者，除季勞外，尙有賈德魯暨英美代表。據接近季勞之人士語人，特季兩人之未來談判，將在阿爾及爾秘密進行。</p>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電　據阿爾及爾消息：居於法國南部之法將軍喬治，已逃赴阿爾及爾，投效季勞麾下。喬治將軍在一九三九年曾任法國西北軍司令。</p>
<p>里期本三十一日中央社電　據維希消息傳稱：自北非戰局結束後，英美對注屬北非之帝國生義政治工作益形露骨。現正企圖將法屬北非分割據爲己有，其中美國似擬侵據法領摩洛哥及西非，以作進出於非洲大陸之政治經濟上之立足點，而英國則擬永久佔領阿爾及里亞，以作制覇地中海之軍事基地。對此特戈爾及季勞之態度如何，殊堪注目。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾斯達林　尚無會晤可能</h3>
<p>瑞典京城卅一日中央社電海通社消息：倫敦政界以爲邱吉爾與斯達林在最近之將來，殊無會晤之可能。美廣播公司駐莫斯科代表謂，兩氏是否會談，要視羅斯福致斯達林函件之內容若何，該函雖有提議兩人會晤之傳說，但仍不能證實云。</p>
<h3>侵歐日期之推測　登陸專家任歐洲美軍顧問</h3>
<p>瑞典京城卅一日中央社電據海通社訊，英京中立國記者報吿：倫敦一般人士已認本年六月二十二日爲侵歐之開始日期，此項日期原僅爲消息靈通人士所知，但現已人人談及此日，亦即穗法停戰之日也。觀察者報最先刋布之，其後各報均提及，大部份英報稱目前之空襲，輿步兵進攻前之排砲轟擊毫無二致云。</p>
<p>瑞典京城卅一日中央社電　據倫敦消息：諾斯少將已被任爲歐洲美軍參謀部之聯合作戰之專家顧問，氏現年四十九歲，係著名登陸專家，利用小舟試騐登陸技能，已歷二十年之久。</p>
<h3>期達林解釋　解散第三國際理由</h3>
<p>莫斯科卅一日中央社電</p>
<p>關於國際共產黨之解散，蘇眞理報僅發表係由於共黨執行委員會之決定。然蘇聯方面對解散之意義，則避免說明。路透社莫斯科特派員會以書面對斯達林委員長質問此次解散之理由，及對國際關係之影響。廿八日斯達林回答謂國際共產黨之解散，乃使各國易於結成共同戰綫，其理由如次：（一）希特勒主義者認蘇聯有干涉他國國民生活，使之共產主義化之野心，此次解散國際共產黨，即將此種見解粉碎。（一）勞動戰綫中反對共產主義者，輒謂各國共產黨非爲其本國國民謀福利，乃受外部命令而活動者，解散國際共產黨，即將此種見解推翻，（一）解散國際共產黨可促進各國愛國主義者與「對法西斯展開鬥爭者」之工作云。</p>
<p>德方評論　柏林卅一日中央社電德國通訊社外交記者霍倫頃對斯達林答覆路透社莫斯科特派員關於解散第三國際之理由，評論如次：斯達林解散第三國際，乃企圖使世界各國相信蘇聯已放棄其干涉他國內政赤化他國之野心。柏林政界認爲斯達林此次聲明，乃一種新宣傳策略，渠企圖於解脫赤化他國責任後而達成其目的。第三國際解散後，斯達林不得不打破沉默，以說明其理由，但其用心已被世界各國窺破，而渠此次解散第三國際，實並未獲得所期之效果。</p>

<h3>傅德機襲英本土　使用液體空氣炸彈　英美機襲歐陸損失重大</h3>
<p>瑞典京城卅一日中央社電瑞典各報近載倫敦消息稱。盛傳德空軍近已使用某種具有甚大威力之「液體空氣炸彈」，轟炸英本土軍需工廠地帶。據稱，此種炸彈具有如下之特別性能，（一）內裝無窒素液體空氣，炸彈爆發時，此空氣與外界空氣接觸後，立即發生暴風，可消滅周圍七百至八百米內之一切地上物。（一）因此種炸彈可於四千至四千五百米之高空正確投下，故高射砲驅逐機攻擊頗難，英空軍已感到一太威脅。衆認因此炸彈之出現，軸心空軍於歐戰中將臨大攻勢時機云。</p>
<p>柏林三十一中央社電　德負責方面宣佈：德快速轟炸機一隊，昨襲英國南岸托桂港。彈多擊中重要目標暨高射砲台，事後德機有四架未曾飛返。</p>

<p>時事選擇</p>
<h3>英美奪北非利益</h3>
<p>（巴黎特電二十二日高田特派員發）軸心軍自從突尼斯·比塞大撤退後·　北非局勢急轉直下，法屬北非的內部，情勢，顯呈極複雜的狀態。美國在非洲上陸的時侯，根據當時駐維希的美國總領事墨飛的建議，首先傾其全力於非洲殖民地土著的懷柔。可是最近非洲的物資。却見相常缺乏，尤以棉製品的缺乏最甚。該地的土著木來完全是囘敎徒，照可蘭經（囘教經典）的敎典上有一種信仰，人死之後，須用棉布包裹後下葬，因此，棉布的不足，竟可發生叛亂的危險，</p>
<p>美國資本主義　很注意這些土著，所以一自加薩勃朗加，阿爾及爾上陸後，即大量遝來這些物資廉價出售，無智的土民被懷柔後，不得已而歡迎美皸陸。</p>
<p>美軍爲防萬一的抵抗或施設的破壞，帶來了很多的鋼鐵材料，水泥，磚瓦，建築材料，鐵橋等，並有火東頭千架·自加薩勃朗加經阿爾及爾至突尼斯的鐵道，本爲單綫，自美軍上陸後，即進行數設綫工事。同時，他們自一上陸即推行通貨工作，把法國法耶對英金磅的市價，意識地從三百法耶抑低至二百法郞，對美元則自七十五法耶抑低至五十法郞。即在今日依然想維持這人爲的市價的安定，猶太人即乘隙而入，開始投機。美國海上保險會社最近又抑低對開往非洲的輪船的海上保險率。這些工作，顯然不單是爲了軍事的必要，事實上，美國的資本家，尤其摩根財閥，正在進行莫大的投資。前法國商工銀行總理樸斯，最近從摩根財閥獲得借款，在北非設立商工銀行就任爲總理，從事統一摩洛哥·阿爾及爾·突尼斯的財政。在目前·英國資本主義，分明已經在美國之下，而不得不迫隨於其後。特戈爾和季祿二者的對立，顯著地表示了英美兩國在新的殖民地藏物之前爲了利益爭奪的不均而起的戰鬥。</p>
<p>特戈爾是代表英國利益的傀儡，季祿是代表美國利益的傀儡，而二者的對立，除其幕後操縱人的關係之外，個人間感情的不洽，亦是一個原因。特戈爾在法國戰收之前，還只是一個無名小卒，他是機械化軍隊主義者，曾著書論述軍隊機械化的必要，可是法國軍部內只常他是理論家，並不採用他的主張，而個人的資望也不夠。季祿和魏剛同爲法軍的老前輩，是純粹的軍人型。特戈爾自逃到英國即向左傾，而老年的季祿則依然是保守的。因此原因，二人的對立，在各方面都表現出來，而祗有等待英美的干逻。現在他們在爭執中的一件事，就是在非洲編練中至五月底完成的卅萬大軍的運用方針。這支軍隊中，經騐最豐富的，是久戰沙塲的特戈爾派，可是季祿却想把這支軍隊　萬一當歸還法國本土的地候當作親衛事，而特戈爾則主張英美在法國本土以外的地點實施登陸作戰的時候，才想拿出來使用。</p>
<p>二者的對立，並可見之於從維希逃到時非洲的法國前內政部長貝魯東的出處問題。貝魯東曾任阿爾及爾·突尼斯的總督，富有經騐，深得土著的民心。季祿不想起用他任內長，而特戈爾則大加反對。（翔：譯自五月二十四日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>英美對西班牙經濟攻勢</h3>
<p>（馬德里特電廿一日大島特派員發）北非戰局告終後的歐洲戰局和政局，在西班牙也引起了很大的波動。</p>
<p>英美在西班牙的工作極爲積極，首先擴充大使館，設宣傳部，備有二千以上的人員，實施有組織的宣傳，從事破球軸心派要人，專變與論。一面並利通過或滯留於西班牙的反德的第三國政客，軍人，其宣傳費達數百萬西帶之鉅。經濟工作尤堪注目，乘西班牙的急於恢復內亂的疲弊現勢，加以種種壓迫工作，本年度輸入了數萬噸的棉花，除了飛機用油之外，石油，重油現在是歐洲第一的輸入國。西班牙和阿根廷所締的貿易協定，有小麥二百萬噸，其他有肉，烟草等，英國的這輸入發行航海證明書的時候，一鬆一緊，加以恐嚇，極盡狡猾之能事。例如法期哥元首在演說中言及和軸心協力時，到明天從外部輸入的物資就絕跡，而各種謠言就接踵而起。現在的西班牙，和一年前因食糧方面的麵包，農作物以至日用品雜貨等不足，而苦惱的情况比較起來，已有顯著的改善。</p>
<p>麵包，肉，砂糖，小麥，牛油，油，咖啡，石炭等，祗有形式上的配給制度，衣服等則毫無限制。去年十二月以來，公共汽車重又開始行駛，魚類，蛋等的出產很豐，果物等的市價也有下跌的現象。</p>
<p>內亂時欠德義的戰債，大體已經償還，一般的觀測，內亂的瘠傷，百分之六七十已經恢復了。（翔：譯自五月二十四日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>海軍魂（六）</h3>
<p>— 亞留申請貝上野山淸</p>
<p>某月某日晨四時。乘大型汽艇出發至鳴神島進行地區調查，如碰到狗頭蔭門魚（DogSalmon）紅眼尊魚的打漁期，也想捕一大堆魚來。乓士，調查員·漁夫數名，加上我，一共二十五六個人。特別好的天氣。國川附近調查，是向貝嘉灣去的進次。艇長大聲喊，「潛水艇！」大家都知道是敵艦將來堅擊的預兆，但兵士準備戰鬥，我們所有的武器只不過是步槍。又加上是很小的船。敵國潛水艇的水面速力的有十五六海里。彼此距離有三千公尺左右，但突然出現於黑色的波浪中。大家都覺得快葬身於亞留申的海底了。「是大敵！眞痛快！衝上去！很久沒有看見的敵人！」這是兵士的聲音。當時突然天空中飛來兩架飛機。我方偵察機急降下，要和你們這些奴才們作空中戰了。潛水艇並不錯入水底，原來是日本的。眞笑話，原來是自己人。兵士才放了心。當時我的心在想，是拾了一條命。（一頁日記）（濤譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>八十壽翕沈信卿先生墨寶快覩記</h3>
<p>— 退翁</p>
<p>敎界耆宿吳縣沈信卿先生，道德文章生平軼事，各報紀載已多，不必在下　蘇了。此次八十大慶，各界領袖，因先生近二十年來，心力所在，惟准鴻　圖書航的維持，所以以先生之志爲志，移壽儀充鴻英圖嘗館經費，發起公祝·壽世壽人，嘉惠後學，可謂不朽之盛舉。同時由籌備委員會的提議，請求壽　同意，寫聯百付，並破例寫摺扇二十面，於六月一日公開展覽於浦中同鄕會，得壽　首肯。前日筆者驅車往鴻英圖書館訪公祝沈壽卿委會員　費者，　見吿壽辰　　，　　　　，均已會畢，並出以相氶，遂　　　怏。茲將印象錄後，以吿仰慕壽翁，欲得壽翁墨寶爲紀念的一般讀者。</p>
<p>（一）壽聯方面：一共有一百零二副。五七書最多。書體篆隸正草，四體具備。其中行楷佔最多數，篆隸和草書較少。聯語大部集李社詩句，集宋詞的龍門對兩付，係壽翁七十九齡時所書，非常工整。壽翁書法由　入王，風神別具。行楷如第二十一號之「剖心輸丹雲胸肊達時地氣思經綸，」二十號之「惠施不肯千萬乘，范子何曾殺五湖，」七十一號之「心事有誰能會得，流光容易把人拋，」尤爲筆者所愛好。大草如三十二號之「化於天地外，寄情在山水間。」七十四號之「無事於此靜坐，有情可以長生」七十三，號之「美人胡爲　秋水，先生有道出　　」，七十五號之「白雲過相　，靑天若可捫，」草勢大氣盤旋，非常雄厚。祿書如六十二號之「往事知何處，此樂與　同，」五十八號之「人生爲逆旅，問事不關心」，渾穆古攔中見筆墨天趣。篆書如七十號之「曾經滄海難爲水，落盡閑花不見人。」六十九號之「秋愛冷吟春愛醉，水爲心地玉爲　，」六十六號之「獨聖淸天下，嶽立冠人曹，」七十七號之「揮手折若木，飛劍決浮雲，」七十八號之「她非黃石老，煎作濟南生，」或工整，或洒落，當在章太炎之上。</p>
<p>（二）摺扇方面：總計只有二十頁，篆祿有四五面，行揩最多，草書只有一面，是背臨十七帖，精神飽滿，行列整齊，一筆不苟。小楷一買，竟是雙行，從頭到尾，字字有神，八十壽翁作此，頗爲難得，而沈先生生平向不書扇，今此自屬難申之難。當世不乏集副的癖好之士，但不會有沈若嬰老人的書扇，現正是一個可貴的可紀念的唯一機會了。扇頁的一面，另由公視沈壽的　備委員會　求得湯定之夏劍丞白蕉藉名家的畫尤爲兩美。湯夏兩先生，素以山水享盛名，花卉夐異常流。白蕉先生以曹家作畫，夙有瀉　聖手之稱，二十頁風面，亦以　爲最多。</p>
<p>聞此次公展壽翁黑寶，所得售價，亦全充鴻英圖書館經費。定價方面對聯裝孩者行楷每付二百元，不皆裱者一百元，草不裱者二百元，孩者三百元，篆祿不孩者三百元，裱者四百元。摺扇則每頁自五百元起至一千五百元</p>

<h3>經濟界　評言　端節與銀根</h3>
<p>近來本市工商各界都感覺銀根緊迫，頭寸不足，週轉不靈。有人說，這是廢曆端節將要到來前每年必有的現象，不足爲奇。不過在此非常時期，平時的金融季節脫素，似乎十九已不適用。</p>
<p>或者又說，目前江浙鄕村的蠶藕，小麥，蠶豆，菜籽等作物相繼登塲，各廠行需要大批現款派員到鄕收買，也是銀根緊迫的另一原因。不過這個解說也僅適用於平時，而非所語於非常時期，因爲今年的收買上市春作物，究竟是與去年沒有什麼大區別的。</p>
<p>目前銀根緊迫的眞正原因，恐怕還是在於國家銀行放款政策的轉變。據說中央儲傭銀行，最近爲協助國府平抑物價安定民生起見，積極收回同業放款，於是各同案行莊亦不得不積極向囤貨客戶，收回放款或透支，或縮少其透放數額或縮短其透放期限；囤貨客戶，以銀根關係，乃不得不脫貨求現，故晨近各貨批發價格多有傾瀉之勢：批發價格下降不已，另售價格邃亦有隨之下落之勢。</p>
<p>由此，可知中央銀行放款政策之慎重與緊縮，對於目前囤貨之取締，物價之平抑，和民生之安定，確實是一種有效手段。甚望該行當局能够持之以恒，不爲似是而非的浮言所動，以致改變其目前慎重的放款政策。</p>

<h3>友情</h3>
<p>— 步建</p>
<p>一個不懂友情的人，不但在他人看來，是個沒有人緣的冷酷孤僻者，就是他本人，也會感到禁錮在「冷宮』裏樣的難受。</p>
<p>有豐富的友情的人，不但能嘗受人生的甜味，感到吃蜜餞樣的，泳在春海樣的舒暢，並且也能促助工作的興奮，和事業的成功。</p>
<p>友情的結合比較不難，或一次邂逅、聚談，宴會就可能熟悉起來。但是要達到深摯，親暱及保持到永久，誰都知道，那不是件易事，而能這樣做到的，那才是眞正的幸福。</p>
<p>有很多的友情，是建立在金錢利益上的，那麼一朝利益上起了些微風波，就會『翻臉無人情』，而趨於破裂。</p>
<p>有的友情，建立於浮面，碰面時，彼此阿諛—認爲這樣謙恭客氣，正是保持友情頂聰明的方法。其實，這樣一朝遇到患難障碍，却不能積極地相助，和眞誠地勸勉了。</p>
<p>眞摯的友情，必然不計私利，而是建於共同的事業上的。也惟有如此的友情，纔能經受得了顚簸，挫折，和保持恒久，促助工作，完成事業。</p>

<h3>日本海軍異聞錄（六）</h3>
<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>（八）快步走</p>
<p>車站中往往有擁擠的現象，於是有一種宣傳，叫人們用正常的步子走路，不要錯亂。那是因爲一般人沒有海軍中所謂「五分前」的陶養，（五分前是日本海軍中一種傳統精神，意謂五分鐘內準備一切），一到車站，大家爭先恐後，把老幼病弱的推開一傍，搶先而去。爲了要抑制這種不守規矩的人，於是就用宣傳的方法叫大家守秩序。〇〇〇驅逐艦的某大尉，好久沒有上陸了，有一次上陸，到車站中，見到那種完全不慣的狀態，顯出T非常奇怪的神氣。</p>
<p>在艦內的時候，扶梯上的走上走下，誰也是疾步而行。似松鼠那樣敏捷地，托·托·托·托地走上走下。因爲這已成了習慣，所以到車站來的時候，在扶梯的地方，足下都趦趄不前。擴聲機在叫着：『請用正常的步子走！』大尉四面張望着，車站內並沒有很大的混雜，走快一點也不妨喟！可是，如果走得快，就要被站員注意罷！他想，一個軍人而這樣，未免太不像樣了。所以他祗能咬着牙齒，從從容容地走下扶梯來。</p>
<p>在船上的日子一久，就有種種習慣，但海軍比較起來和疾走似乎有特別深的因綠。</p>
<p>在軍事學校中，有一種登宮島的彌山的分隊競走，這是著名的很苦很激烈的疾走，不僅如此，想進這種學校的人，必須先要知道，即在平常的日子，學生們在校內總　用快步走路的。走路的姿勞，也必須非常正確。規規矩矩地把手撑在腰裏，鑰·遠。遊地走着，因爲這實是一部分學校時間中最注蠶的事。</p>
<p>學生在一天沒有一點空閒的時候。上了這課，又上那謀，從這敎室走到那敎室，安排得沒有一點空。</p>
<p>其决想說的　皇族進學校的狀况，那皇族在學校中的生活，也和別的學生一樣受嚴格的訓練，照着繁忙的時間表，急忙忙地走來走去。筆奢　　的時候，怡和久邇宮德彥王殿下同學。殿下一走進學生館的正面大門，立即到左手的自修室，和同班的同學一周自修，自修終了後，如其輪到當値日生，就在黑极上用粉筆寫着，『十月八日，水　，西及北　四米，左右，晴」。寫完，就靴聲，　　地急步走上扶梯，到樓上的宿合歸寢。</p>
<p>學生們徒朝晨起身的喇叭號起到列隊操塲前爲止，不足十五分鐘。初入學的四號學生，先經過嚴酷的訓練，不久就成爲習慣了。如其在整隊時刻之先，已經到了操塲，那麽利用整隊前極短的時問，即使五秒鐘十秒鐘也好，大聲作號令的練習，『　息……立正……」</p>
<p>一到星期日，大家都到俱樂部去划船，同學間連扯談的時間也極少。他們都有一種悠然的神情。把身命寄託於偉大的東西、那種心安理得的態度、明顯地浮漾在他們的行動上　外人見了，都說這海軍敎育是一個謎。但是這種學校的存在，固然是學生的倖運，也就是日本的最大的倖運。（翼：譯自朝日新聞）。</p>
<h3>出征　（四）</h3>
<p>— 海軍報道班員　濱本浩著</p>
<p>『船眞不錯！』江戶預備中尉在嘴裏這樣說，但在他心裏却想，不要大驚小怪，應當如何在這艘船上服務。</p>
<p>這個地方並不像內地那樣穩健的黃昏，是太陽一落，馬上就看不見路。松前預備少尉用手電燈照着路，並吿訴江戶說：</p>
<p>『方才所說的砲台上的人們，他們很喜歡稱自己是靑天一家人。在野地過落，當然只能遠眺靑天。在此地一住，不知不覺地就變成幽默家，同時也就喜歡起這種態度來，所以大家都喜歡隨便說。也許這是常常給自己生活打氣。但在行動方面，都是很好的武士。喂！注意１你那個地方有鐵絲綱，』</p>
<p>在暗暗的廣塲的那邊，有隱的地透出光亮的兵房，後那裏傳播出雄壯軍歌的大合唱。</p>
<p>松前少尉解釋着說：「兵士們在調劑他們的精力。那是航空隊的兵房。』</p>
<p>周圍非常的暗，在黑影中，心裏總覺着是躱藏着什摩東西。</p>
<p>『第一次站在槍林彈雨中時，究竟感覺如何？』江戶中尉不知從何處聯想到這個問題，而這樣問了。</p>
<p>松前少尉並不打算想什麼，輕輕笑着說：「肚皮餓了，喉嚨發癢。」</p>
<p>『但我很羨慕在艦船上服務，不用步走也可以碰到敵人，至於食物和水總是帶在周圍，」松前又這樣講出自己的經騐來。　談　着話，不知不覺地已經到了江戶中尉宿舍的前面，江戶勸說：「不到屋裏坐一下麽？」</p>
<p>「明天再見吧！因爲十二點鐘還要値班，需要少微睡一覺，』松前少尉就這樣告辭了。</p>
<p>江戶囘到屋裏，脫下軍服，而從皮包中取出浴衣來。</p>
<p>當在這個時候，從另外一張床上發出聲音來，說。。「是江戶預備中尉　？』</p>
<p>他心中想，這一定是在自己跑出去的時候，來的客人，順便就同答了一聲「是」字。</p>
<p>那位客人就從蚊帳裏鑽出來，一面拖着籘精向前來，一面在作自我介紹，說自己是到前方航空隊赴任去的軍需中尉，是一位好像穿着學生服的靑年軍官，但聲音却很宏亮。</p>
<p>「方才從司令部裏派人來說，你服務的艦晚上已經入港了所以明天早七點鐘，要到艦艇上去，』這樣地吿訴了他。</p>
<p>江戶道了謝，並問：</p>
<p>「你什麼時候動身？』</p>
<p>『我也是明天早晨，聽說明天有飛機。」</p>
<p>軍需中尉，點着香烟說：</p>
<p>「這個宿舍，正確一點說是三號宿舍，據說一般人都稱爲一宿莊。像我們這樣住一宿的人是很多的。這正像社會上的旅館一樣，只是具有另外的戰地之感。無論怎樣說，這個一宿莊名詞，叫得很對，人類即使在生死的一殺那，也總是忘不掉開開玩笑。所以也許滿不在乎地跑入槍林彈雨中，』似乎很快樂地周　看了一下並無任何點綴的屋子。</p>
<p>翌晨，在門口迎接江戶到任的『黑金」艇長，完全不像傳銳和他想像山的人物。</p>
<p>體格非常魁偉，而週身却像生長於雪國一樣的潔白·而白，無鬚，眉淸目秀，覺得有一種爽之感。衣着也很雅致，而穿着長襪白鞋的脚，細長地伸直着。江戶常行到任禮時，艇長很客氣地彎彎腰。</p>
<p>「這樣遠的路程，眞太辛苦了——到這邊來凉快一下吧！」說着，就把江戶領到前面甲板的帆布椅子那邊去了。</p>
<p>於是艇長就開始說明。</p>
<p>剛是前晚進港的艇，而又接到明天就要出發的命令。雖然只是一天的停泊，但今天所有的船員都忙碌地補充彈藥，燃料，糧食，淡水等。登陸期間並未能洗一洗汗臭的衣服，對於兵士說這眞是一件大的憾事，但這是戰爭，所以實在不得已。這樣關懷兵士的詞句也溢於言表。</p>
<p>但其他兵士也決不偷懶。刷甲板洗器具的也有，對於損壞的椅子敲釘的也有。兵士們看着很精神的在忙着工作。但經過討論工作的艇長和新任砲術長的傍邊時，都規規矩矩地施行敬禮。簡直惑覺不出像別人所說的『黑金一家人」邪種滋味，而只是感到嚴肅。</p>
<p>『把先任　校喚來！」艇長向勤務兵這樣說。</p>
<p>被喚來的任將校先對着艇長恭恭敬敬地　『有什麼事麼？』並看不出　是劍道三段的豪</p>
<p>兩只像是　正秀麗的軍官。</p>
<p>房間裏的床空着嗎？」</p>
<p>艇長想把新任砲術長安置在那間房子裏。</p>
<p>「砲術長的行李已經搬過去了。防暑的制服也亦準備好了。』這是先任將校對着江戶說的。</p>
<p>「謝謝—」</p>
<p>艇長這樣犒勞了部下一句，站起來說：</p>
<p>「我領着你把艇的內部看一下吧！』</p>
<p>狹窄的艦橋也整理得很淸潔。</p>
<p>「這個你看怎麼樣？這是我的新設計。』</p>
<p>艇長一面這樣說着，一面走上台子去，把上面的像蓋打開一部。只那一部份用絞鏈鎖着，突然一開口，則看見蔚藍的天空了</p>
<p>「敵機來時，就是從這個地方探出頭去看的。盡量想把天蓋拿下去，但，　樣作是不行的。」這樣少微表示了他的豪傑氣慨，後來又指着海圖室後面的小屋說：「這是我的別墅。」</p>
<p>探進頭去一看，在狹窄的墻上，貼着敵機種類的圖表。在其傍邊有一張很奇怪的人物照片在鏡框內掛着。是褪色的一張老照片。是一位穿着白色日本舊式禮服，菩着古代的方形鬚的漂亮人物。</p>
<p>「艇長。這位是淸水决郞長老前輩是吧！」江戶這樣同着。</p>
<p>「你倒知道，呵－哈！哈哈！」艇長這樣說着捧腹大笑。（瀉：譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>Respectful Wishes for Mr. Shen Gao's Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>In these perilous and difficult times, with national affairs in disarray, we are not inclined to write eulogies for any individual. However, today, on the occasion of the eightieth birthday of Mr. Shen Xinqing and Mr. Gao Hanqing, it is necessary to express our respectful congratulations and to particularly draw the attention of the nation to this event. This is because the longevity of these two gentlemen is closely related to the cultural endeavors of our country, and their long lives symbolize the bright future of our nation's cultural undertakings!</p>
<p>Mr. Xinqing's morality and writings do not require promotion by the media, as they have already left a deep impression on the minds of the people. We believe that what is particularly worthy of respect are two major undertakings beyond his personal morality and writings. The first is his tireless efforts in supporting education. Since establishing the Longdou Academy before the Republic, and later presiding over the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association after the revolution, up to advocating for the widespread opening of lectures, he has established a glorious record in the history of China's national enlightenment movement. In particular, since 1917, Mr. Xinqing and Mr. Huang Renzhi, recognizing the special needs of the Republic's construction, advocated for vocational education. Under the motto of "enabling the unemployed to have employment" and "enabling the employed to improve their employment," they founded the "Chinese Vocational Education Society." For more than twenty years, throughout the country, they have cultivated many practical professionals who serve the country and society. The voices of "vocational education" and "versatile hands" have resonated throughout the nation. The ancients said, "A single word can revitalize a nation," and Mr. Xinqing has not only advocated but also practiced tirelessly and taught without fatigue. This spirit will surely be boundless. The second is his efforts to promote the library cause. In 1924, Mr. Xinqing and his friends founded the "Jiazi Society" to collect modern historical materials, which was later expanded into the "Humanities Library." With the assistance of Mr. Ye Hongying, its scale was further expanded, resulting in the nationally renowned "Hongying Library" today. Mr. Xinqing has been in charge of it for twenty years, visiting the library every day, regardless of wind, rain, cold, or heat. Even at the age of eighty, he still supports himself with a cane and dedicates himself to public service, without seeking fame or profit. Others may fear being unable to get rid of it quickly, but Mr. Xinqing alone "knows it cannot be done but does it anyway." This spirit is truly worthy of our younger generation's admiration! And its contribution to public education and China's cultural undertakings cannot be measured by any standard! In his early years, Mr. Xinqing once edited the "Common Sense" section of this newspaper, greatly enhancing the wisdom of young people, which not only enhanced the newspaper's reputation.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanqing is a devout and sincere Christian who, with the dedication and singleness of purpose of a religious person, strives for cultural undertakings. More than thirty years ago, recognizing that the backwardness of China's modern cultural undertakings, especially publishing, was a major cause of national poverty and weakness, he, along with Mr. Zhang Jusheng and the late Mr. Xia Cuifang, founded the Commercial Press, which became one of the largest publishing enterprises in our country. Mr. Hanqing has devoted himself to its management, and although the environment has changed and personnel have experienced vicissitudes, he has remained diligent and loyal to the institution, without ever wavering. This spirit of dedicating one's life to a cause is not for the sake of the institution itself, but actually for the benefit of the entire Chinese publishing industry, which is to provide the people with spiritual food.</p>
<p>Today, we are delighted to celebrate Mr. Xinqing's eightieth birthday, and in ten days (the twentieth of this month), we will also celebrate Mr. Hanqing's eightieth birthday. How should we celebrate these two great figures in the cultural world, and how should we express our respect for these pioneers of Chinese culture? According to reports, as both elders have always advocated against lavish birthday celebrations, friends of Mr. Xinqing have decided to follow his wishes and use the money intended for public toasts and banquets to fund the Hongying Library, "celebrating the person and benefiting the world, leaving a lasting memory." This is truly the most reasonable and pleasing approach for Mr. Xinqing. For Mr. Hanqing, celebrities from all walks of life have also initiated public celebrations, and Mr. Hanqing has generously donated 10,000 yuan for disaster relief in the north, declaring that he will not accept gifts, and that any cash gifts will be donated to disaster relief. This is a way of "fulfilling good wishes together and leaving behind kindness forever," which is also the most timely celebration. In addition to hoping that friends from all walks of life will understand the elders' hearts and jointly express the wish to "celebrate the person and benefit the world," we should learn from the elders' consistent enthusiasm and solemn attitude towards cultural and educational undertakings. We hope that all sectors of society will help to expand the scale of the Hongying Library, making it the most comprehensive and abundant library in East Asia, opening the door of convenience to poor scholars everywhere. We also hope that the vocational education movement that Mr. Xinqing has been devoted to for more than twenty years, with its emphasis on "respecting work and enjoying work," will have a more widespread and in-depth development, cultivating thousands upon thousands of talents for the future construction of the Chinese nation. We also hope that the Commercial Press, which Mr. Hanqing has diligently managed for decades, will quickly resume publishing new books, and continue to provide an inexhaustible source of spiritual food for students and experts across the country. We respectfully offer our congratulations to the two elders, and look forward to countless great figures in the cultural world following in their footsteps!</p>
<h3>Dawn of the Revival of China's Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>The torrent of Chinese culture has unfortunately been hindered in the past six or seven years due to the prolonged war. It has stagnated, it has declined! However, this is only a superficial appearance. The Chinese people all understand that the torrent of a nation's culture will never truly come to a sudden halt. It has a latent power. In the heart of every person, to a greater or lesser extent, there is a demand for the cultivation of cultural life. The essence of the cultural torrent has the characteristic of "cutting off water with a knife only makes it flow more." The people's demand for cultural life has the tendency to seek food in hunger. Therefore, the trend of Chinese culture towards revival is an inevitable conclusion.</p>
<p>When discussing a nation's culture, scholars generally analyze it into ten aspects: 1. Literature and History; 2. Politics; 3. Economics; 4. Science; 5. Philosophy; 6. Ethics; 7. Religion; 8. Craftsmanship; 9. Fine Arts; 10. Figures. In terms of cultural content, it is generally no more than this. What we want to further point out here is that these ten analyzed aspects are three-dimensional and active things. Recording these things in writing and passing them on for a long time constitutes books. In other words, national culture is the crystallization of a nation's life, and the undertaking and responsibility of the publishing industry is to absorb this crystallized substance, use paper and ink as materials, and writing as form, to produce books, which are widely distributed and passed on for a long time.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the New Policies in the late Qing Dynasty, the cultural centers of the country have been Beijing and Shanghai. Beijing is the place where China's inherent cultural relics are preserved and gathered, while Shanghai is the place where new cultures converge and radiate. In other words, Beijing has more cultural relics and talents, while Shanghai is the general hub of the publishing industry. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, under the actual environment of the spreading flames of war, the decline of the publishing industry is an inevitable phenomenon. The urgent need to remedy this phenomenon and prevent its continuation is a common view among insightful people in the country. However, in the past six or seven years, the publishing industry in Shanghai has ultimately been in a state of prolonged decline. The reasons for this are: first, there is an extreme shortage of printing materials, with average prices being more than a hundred times higher than before the war, especially the soaring price of paper; second, prices are soaring and life is difficult. Cultural figures, who are the center of the publishing industry, are either displaced and struggling or struggling to survive, and have no energy to engage in writing. If these two factors continue to exist, even if there are people with enthusiasm and sincerity who want to seek the revival and promotion of the publishing industry, it will be difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a major turning point for the publishing industry has arrived. Many famous publishers in Shanghai have, based on their great aspirations and ideals to serve culture, voluntarily concentrated their manpower and organized the China United Publishing Company to restore and promote the publishing industry. After several months of preparation, it is scheduled to open today. In today's decline of the publishing industry, such a surprising move cannot help but make us feel extremely excited. For many years, we have been distressed by the silence of the publishing industry and the stagnation of all cultural undertakings. We have loudly appealed, hoping that cultural figures will come out and make the greatest struggle for the Chinese cultural world. Now, in Shanghai, the center of the publishing industry, the manpower and material resources of the publishing industry have finally been gathered to form this united organization, and its contribution to culture is so great that it is not necessary for us to praise it any further.</p>
<p>We have high expectations for the China United Publishing Company. For the sake of the revival of China's cultural undertakings, we hope that the company will not be constrained by the position of pursuing profits, but should assume the normal cultural mission from the standpoint of the country, and promote wartime cultural work. We hope that people from all walks of life, especially cultural figures, will encourage and assist the company. We hope that the reading public in society will supervise, recommend, and promote the company's publications.</p>
<p>However, what we are worried about is that the printing materials are so scarce and the prices are so high that the price of books is almost impossible for readers to afford. Since the company is a commercial organization, we certainly cannot expect it to operate at a loss. To fundamentally solve the problem, we cannot but ask the government authorities to severely punish merchants who hoard printing materials, especially paper. Moreover, we hope that we can emulate the policies of friendly countries such as Japan and provide a sufficient allocation of paper for legitimate purposes. This will surely have a great impetus for the future of China's publishing industry and the future of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Finally, we respectfully wish the China United Publishing Company a boundless future! The Chinese publishing industry a boundless future! And Chinese cultural undertakings a boundless future!</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Hunan-Hubei Area Launch Continuous Attacks and Achieve Significant Results; Elite Japanese Troops in Yichang Reach Muqiaoxi</h3>
<p>Hankou, May 31st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a certain location on the Hunan-Hubei front, after Japanese elite troops fiercely attacked the Chongqing Defense Forces, known as the "elite and strong" forces guarding the Bashan Mountains west of Anchang, they have been pressing forward in close cooperation with the air force despite the adverse weather conditions. By the 27th, they launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing 11th, 18th, and 141st Divisions, which were stubbornly resisting along the dangerous terrain from Qianniuling (748 meters high) to Guishan, 18 kilometers west of Yichang. They also broke through several thousand Chongqing troops who were stubbornly resisting in the Yanglinzi and Fufang areas. After dusk on the same day, they launched more than a dozen fierce attacks on the Chongqing troops. The elite Japanese troops moving north also broke through the Chongqing troops who were stubbornly resisting along the dangerous terrain in the Qianniuling area at dawn on the 28th, seized the summit, and completely occupied all the surrounding heights, capturing a large number of mountain guns, mortars, and other weapons and ammunition. As a result of this battle, the Chongqing army's defensive positions, which connected Wangsi, Yanglinzi, Qianniuling, Huashiban, Yongchangsi, Zhangjiahe, and other places over a distance of 40 kilometers, were completely broken through in the center, and the advance continued. By dusk on the 28th, they had broken through the enemy's defensive lines at Shibei, Dazhujiaping (22 kilometers west of Yichang), Caojiapan, and Shuiqiaoxi (45 kilometers north of Yuyangguan). The Japanese troops advancing from the east of Qianniuling also defeated the Chongqing troops who were stubbornly resisting in the Beidoushan area (784 meters high), 10 kilometers north of Yichang. By the evening of the 30th, they had broken through the strong Chongqing positions south of Beidoushan. In addition, the Japanese troops who broke through Qianniuling further pursued the remnants of the Chongqing 35th Division, 18th Division, Provisional 34th Division, and other units. By the afternoon of the 29th, they had broken through Gangjiaban, a key point of the Chongqing army, and penetrated the strong Chongqing positions in the Baotongshu area, 25 kilometers west of Yichang, and the Sanchakou area, 35 kilometers west of Yichang, and quickly occupied them. They also coordinated with the Japanese troops in the Qianniuling and Qingyan areas, crossed the Qingjiang River from Duzhenwan, and advanced. The Japanese troops moving from the north and south, after fiercely suppressing the remnants of the Chongqing army along the way, have reached Zhoujiakou on the bank of the Danshui River, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat, and occupying Muqiaoxi, a key point of the Chongqing army's transportation. At this point, the three Chongqing Jiangfang Divisions, which were boasted to be "elite and strong," were completely annihilated near Qingyan and Qianniuling. The Japanese air force, which participated in this annihilation battle and cooperated with the ground troops, was also extremely active, especially during the three days of fighting on the 27th, 28th, and 29th, and has crushed the strong defensive lines of the Chongqing side at Beidoushan and Sanguanyan.</p>
<p>Hankou, May 31st (Central News Agency) After the Japanese troops in the Hunan-Hubei area began a fierce attack on the Chongqing troops entrenched near Yichang, they had advanced to Shipi (18 kilometers northwest of Yichang) and Muqiaoxi (26 kilometers southwest of Yichang) on the 29th, and continued to attack the remnants of the Chongqing troops, forcing them to retreat into the mountainous areas northwest of Yichang. The Chongqing troops guarding the south bank of the Hanshui River are still lurking in their positions without moving. The Chongqing troops in the Yuezhou, Jingmen, and Dongjie areas have launched counterattacks, but have been repelled by the Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Hankou, May 31st (Central News Agency) Japanese troops are now fiercely attacking the remnants of the Chongqing army everywhere around Wuhan, crushing their movements. The battle situation is as follows: (1) The Japanese troops in the Jiujiang-Nanchang area fiercely attacked a part of the Chongqing Forward Second Column near Dujiashan on the 19th. On the same day, they also swept away the remaining Chongqing troops near Huaji, Wentang, and Xingzi. On the 21st, they fought with the New Fourth Army, which had invaded the Dahebao area south of Jiujiang, and defeated them in one fell swoop. The Japanese garrison also suddenly attacked the Chongqing Special Task Force near Panlingguan on the same day, capturing a large number of rifles and ammunition. (2) The Japanese garrison on the Yuehan Railway line repelled the Chongqing troops who had infiltrated between Yanglousi and Liqiao on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Henan Occupy Jinzhenji; National Army in Dongtai Achieves Victory in Attack</h3>
<p>Kaifeng, May 31st (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>After the elite Japanese troops began operations on the 30th, they attacked Jinzhenji, where the enemy's headquarters was located. Another unit reached the enemy's headquarters and then crossed the river to cut off the enemy's retreat. With the cooperation of the air force, they launched a fierce attack on the enemy troops who attempted to flee, completely defeating them.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, May 31st (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The elite Japanese troops launched a coordinated attack at dawn on the 30th, and broke into Jinzhenji, where the Chongqing army headquarters was located, at 6:00 a.m. A unit of a certain unit also advanced to Posu, the point behind the Chongqing army headquarters where they would have crossed the river, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat. The Japanese army air force cooperated with the army to fiercely bomb the Chongqing troops who tried to escape, causing them to fall into the river and drown. The results of the first day of the Japanese army's operation are as follows: 300 corpses of Chongqing soldiers were left behind, 15 were captured, and the Japanese army captured 218 rifles and 2,300 bullets. In addition, 300 Chongqing soldiers were killed by Japanese aircraft while in 16 boats.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, May 31st (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Japanese army's operations in the Taihang Mountains this spring have inflicted a great blow on the Chongqing army (First War Zone). Now, the Japanese army unexpectedly surrounded 2,500 people of the Chongqing army (14th Column), which was gathered at Jinzhenji on the Xinhe River, 50 kilometers south of Kaifeng, at dawn on the 30th, and is now launching a fierce annihilation battle against them.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Dongtai According to reports from Dongtai, since the Qingxiang work in northern Jiangsu was launched, the New Fourth Army, in order to avoid being completely annihilated, has divided into several groups and fled to various places. On the 26th and 27th of this month, a group of bandits attempted to invade Fuan, Jiugu, and Fang. Our garrison forces, the 137th Regiment of the Provisional 35th Division, met them head-on and fiercely suppressed them, repelling the bandits and killing more than 100. After suffering this heavy blow, the bandits gathered a large force on the 23rd and 24th and attacked the Fuan, Liangdu, Dai Mi, and other defense zones of Anping. Fortunately, Commander Zhao Junsan of the Provisional 25th Division of the National Army garrisoned in Dongtai led his troops to launch attacks in multiple directions, finally defeating the thieves. Local security has been restored to normal. In this battle, 40 rifles were captured, more than 1,000 bandits were killed, and one bandit adjutant and five soldiers were captured.</p>

<h3>Rioters Disturb Capital's Security; Two Criminals, Hu and Ci, Executed Yesterday; Other Major Criminals in Henan Have Been Sentenced</h3>
<p>Nanjing, May 31st (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Chongqing rioters repeatedly attempted to assassinate key figures of the National Government and disrupt the security of the capital. Their conspiracies and vicious plans were prevented or crushed by our relevant authorities. However, Zhu Ming, the commander of the Zhongjiu Army Southern Detachment, and Yuan Can, the puppet magistrate of Jurong County, dared to rekindle their activities, instigating criminals Hu Benlan and Ci Ronghai to detonate explosives at the New Asia Ballroom in Nanjing, injuring innocent civilians. They also plotted to assassinate the supreme leader and bomb the Dahua Theater. Fortunately, the Allied military police headquarters discovered the plot and, in cooperation with the investigation and statistics department's political security headquarters, quickly solved the case and arrested all the major criminals. Hu and Ci were found guilty of heinous crimes and were sentenced to death by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission as a warning. They were taken to Yuhuatai execution ground and shot at 7:00 a.m. on the 31st. Li Fei, Yan Zheng gang et al. were given heavy punishment.</p>

<h3>Lin Sen Dies</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, May 31st (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, Chairman Lin Sen of Chongqing recently passed away due to a serious illness on May 31st at the age of 82. Lin Sen was born in Minhou County, Fujian Province, in the first year of the Tongzhi reign. In the late Qing Dynasty, he lived in the United States for many years and helped Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese revolution, to devote himself to the revolution. After the First Revolution, he served as Chairman of the Senate of the Provisional Government of Nanjing. In 1927, when the National Government was established, he was elected as a member of the government. In 1931, he assumed the position of Chairman of the National Government. After the National Government returned to Nanjing in 1940, he was controlled by the Chongqing faction and held only a nominal title under Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. After Lin Sen fell ill recently, the Chongqing faction convened a temporary emergency meeting on the 29th of this month to revise its organizational law, deciding that if the chairman was unable to handle government affairs for any reason, the president of the Executive Yuan would act as his agent. Now that Lin Sen is dead, the position of chairman will be concurrently held by Chiang Kai-shek in his capacity as president of the Executive Yuan. (Another telegram) I have just received news from Chongqing that Lin Sen, the head of the Chongqing regime, who had been receiving treatment in the hospital for cerebral congestion, died on the 31st.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on Attu Island Sacrificed Themselves for Their Country; All of Japan Mourns; Students Volunteer to Kill Enemies and Avenge the Dead; Workers Strive to Increase Production and Strengthen Combat Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, May 31st (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo paid homage to the spirits of the war dead at Yasukuni Shrine at 11:30 a.m. on the 31st, reporting the heroic sacrifice of the warriors on Attu Island, praying for their blessings, and expressing his firm determination to avenge the dead and kill the enemy. Navy Minister Shimada also visited Yasukuni Shrine at 3:00 p.m. on the same day, making the same report.</p>
<p>Tokyo, May 31st (Central News Agency) The heroic sacrifice of more than 1,000 Japanese defenders on Attu Island has deeply saddened the entire nation of Japan, and their determination to defeat Britain and the United States has been further strengthened. Thousands of students in schools across the country have unanimously petitioned the authorities to volunteer to kill the enemy, and the workers of one factory have also unanimously decided to strive to increase aircraft production. Today, 100 million people in Japan are united in hatred and filled with fighting spirit, determined to do their best in their respective positions to avenge the fallen martyrs by defeating Britain and the United States. For example, 1,200 students of the Colonial Science Department and 200 students of the Agricultural Preparatory Course at Nihon University in Kanagawa Prefecture were undergoing training on the training ground on the evening of the 30th when they suddenly received the sad news of the sacrifice of the Japanese troops on Attu Island. They were deeply angered and immediately petitioned the department head, Mr. Komatsu Yudo, to allow them to volunteer as members of the volunteer army to go to the front line to kill the enemy. Mr. Komatsu was deeply moved and immediately gathered all the students to explain the matter, suspending training. All the students then lined up at 8:00 p.m. and set off without sleeping all night. At 9:00 a.m. on the 31st, they arrived in Tokyo, worshiped remotely in front of the Imperial Palace, and vowed to avenge the fallen martyrs before returning to school in formation. They then convened a meeting of 1,500 representative students from the Law Department in the auditorium, urging them to join the volunteer army and kill the enemy together. The students of the Law Department immediately agreed, and the students of the school are currently intensifying their military training. The school has also been negotiating with the military on this matter. In addition, the students living in the dormitory of Tokyo First Higher School gathered in the dormitory courtyard on the evening of the 30th. The deputy dormitory chairman reported on the heroic sacrifice of the Japanese troops on Attu Island. All the students were deeply saddened upon hearing the news and decided to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and continue to advance. They sang the "Du Ku" song together, and after the song, they all prayed silently towards Attu Island. The workers of the dormitory of the workers of the Minamishinagawa Factory of the Hitachi Aircraft Manufacturing Plant heard the news of the sacrifice of the Japanese defenders on Attu Island on the radio at 5:00 p.m. on the 30th. All the workers were deeply saddened and shouted loudly, "We will definitely avenge this! We will do our best to build more aircraft and transport them to the front to help the war!" At 9:00 p.m. that evening, they all prayed silently towards Attu Island, and at 5:00 a.m. on the 31st, they all visited the shrine, determined to defeat Britain and the United States and increase production to avenge the dead. All the workers of the Ikegai Iron Works Tamachi Factory also decided to work overtime for one week, from the 31st to the 6th of June, and donate all the allowances they earned to the army to be used for military purposes.</p>

<h3>Negotiations between the Two Leaders of the French Splinter Faction Commence in North Africa; Churchill Has a Frank Conversation with de Lattre, Revealing Increasingly Blatant Anglo-American Ambitions</h3>
<p>Madrid, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to a report from the Havas News Agency, British Prime Minister Churchill met with General Giraud, a leader of the French rebels in North Africa, in Gibraltar on the 28th. Discussions centered on the necessity for Giraud to quickly reconcile with de Gaulle. Simultaneously, reports indicate that Churchill has departed Gibraltar for Algiers, presumably to personally attend the meeting between de Gaulle and Giraud, allowing him to exert pressure on them when necessary. However, the reported news of Churchill's visit to Gibraltar or Algiers has not been confirmed by any official sources.</p>
<p>Cairo, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to Havas News Agency, the details of British Prime Minister Churchill's talks in Gibraltar on the 27th and 28th of this month were learned here last night. According to informed sources, Churchill arrived in Gibraltar by plane from Washington on the evening of the 27th. General Giraud had already arrived in Gibraltar from North Africa earlier. Immediately after their meeting, Churchill and Giraud began negotiations, with senior British officials also participating, to resolve the dispute between Generals Giraud and de Gaulle. Havas News Agency reporters learned from reliable sources that Churchill emphasized to Giraud the need to quickly agree on a plan with the leader of the Free French National Committee in London, General de Gaulle. General Catroux, Allied Commander-in-Chief Eisenhower, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of North Africa General Alexander, and Commander of the British Eighth Army General Montgomery all participated. The issues of future military operations and the division of Anglo-American spheres of influence in North Africa have likely been discussed. Therefore, Churchill's trip to Gibraltar is seen as a direct result of the Roosevelt-Churchill talks.</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: Upon arriving in Algiers, de Gaulle issued a formal statement declaring that the planned negotiations between de Gaulle and Giraud would commence at 2:00 PM today. Giraud stated that he welcomed de Gaulle's arrival, as he sincerely desired the unity of the two factions for the sake of French interests. De Gaulle's arrival in Algiers was kept quite secret, so the citizens made no response. Besides Giraud, those welcoming de Gaulle at the airport included Catroux and Anglo-American representatives. According to individuals close to Giraud, the future negotiations between de Gaulle and Giraud will be conducted secretly in Algiers.</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to news from Algiers, French General Georges, residing in southern France, has fled to Algiers and joined Giraud's forces. General Georges served as the commander of the French Northwest Army in 1939.</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to reports from Vichy, since the end of the North African campaign, Anglo-American imperialist political activities in North Africa have become increasingly blatant. They are now attempting to divide French North Africa and take it for themselves. The United States seems to intend to seize French Morocco and West Africa as a political and economic foothold for accessing the African continent, while Britain intends to permanently occupy Algeria as a military base for dominating the Mediterranean. The attitudes of de Gaulle and Giraud toward this are worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>No Possibility of a Churchill-Stalin Meeting</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency, Havas News Agency: Political circles in London believe that there is no possibility of a meeting between Churchill and Stalin in the near future. The American Broadcasting Company's correspondent in Moscow stated that whether the two will meet depends on the content of Roosevelt's letter to Stalin. Although there are rumors that the letter proposed a meeting between the two, this cannot be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Date of the Invasion of Europe; Landing Expert Appointed as Advisor to American Forces in Europe</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency, according to Havas News Agency, neutral country reporters in London report: The general public in London now considers June 22nd of this year as the starting date for the invasion of Europe. This date was originally known only to informed sources, but now everyone is talking about it. It is also the day of the armistice between Sweden and France. The Observer newspaper first published it, and then other newspapers mentioned it. Most British newspapers say that the current air raids are no different from the artillery bombardment before the infantry offensive.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to news from London, Rear Admiral Knowles has been appointed as an expert advisor on joint operations to the staff of the American forces in Europe. He is 49 years old and is a famous landing expert who has been testing landing skills using small boats for twenty years.</p>
<h3>Expect Stalin to Explain the Reasons for Dissolving the Third International</h3>
<p>Moscow, May 31st, Central News Agency</p>
<p>Regarding the dissolution of the Communist International, the Soviet newspaper Pravda only stated that it was due to the decision of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. However, the Soviet side avoided explaining the meaning of the dissolution. The Reuters correspondent in Moscow sent a written inquiry to Chairman Stalin asking for the reasons for the dissolution and its impact on international relations. On the 28th, Stalin replied that the dissolution of the Communist International would make it easier for countries to form a common front. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Hitlerites believe that the Soviet Union has the ambition to interfere in the national life of other countries and communize them. The dissolution of the Communist International will shatter this view. (2) Anti-communists in the labor front often say that the communist parties of various countries do not work for the welfare of their own people but are acting under external orders. The dissolution of the Communist International will overturn this view. (3) The dissolution of the Communist International can promote the work of patriots in various countries and "those who are fighting against fascism."</p>
<p>German Commentary, Berlin, May 31st, Central News Agency, the diplomatic correspondent of the German News Agency, Höllen, recently commented on Stalin's reply to the Reuters correspondent in Moscow regarding the reasons for the dissolution of the Third International, as follows: Stalin's dissolution of the Third International is an attempt to make all countries in the world believe that the Soviet Union has abandoned its ambition to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and communize them. Political circles in Berlin believe that Stalin's statement is a new propaganda strategy. He is trying to achieve his goals after disclaiming responsibility for communizing other countries. After the dissolution of the Third International, Stalin had to break his silence to explain the reasons, but his intentions have been seen through by all countries in the world, and his dissolution of the Third International has not achieved the desired effect.</p>
<h3>Stilwell Arrives in England</h3>
<p>Lisbon, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to news from London, General Stilwell, the commander of the American forces stationed in Chongqing, has arrived in the United States.

<h3>German Aircraft Raid British Mainland, Using Liquid Air Bombs; British and American Aircraft Suffer Heavy Losses Raiding Continental Europe</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: Swedish newspapers recently published news from London stating that it is rumored that the German Air Force has recently used a certain kind of "liquid air bomb" with great power to bomb the military industrial areas of the British mainland. It is said that this kind of bomb has the following special properties: (1) It contains nitrogen-free liquid air. When the bomb explodes, this air comes into contact with the outside air and immediately causes a storm that can destroy everything on the ground within 700 to 800 meters around it. (2) Because this kind of bomb can be accurately dropped from an altitude of 4,000 to 4,500 meters, it is difficult for anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes to attack. The British Air Force has felt a great threat. It is believed that the appearance of this bomb indicates that the Axis air force will launch a major offensive in the European war.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 31st, Central News Agency: The German responsible party announced that a German fast bomber squadron attacked the port of Torquay on the south coast of Britain yesterday. Many bombs hit important targets and anti-aircraft gun positions. Afterwards, four German planes did not return.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: The British Air Ministry announced that German planes again attacked a coastal city in East Anglia on Sunday night. Ground losses were considerable, with several deaths and many homeless. The name of the city was not announced in the communique.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, May 31st, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from London, the British Air Ministry announced on the 31st that the British Air Force lost a total of 135 aircraft during attacks on Germany and German-occupied Europe in the past week.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 31st, Central News Agency: A German news agency said that the US Eighth Bomber Squadron lost a total of 28 four-engine giant bombers and more than 180 pilots when it attacked Brittany on Saturday afternoon. The American aircraft flew at an altitude of 7,000 feet and arrived off the coast of northern France in three batches. However, they were immediately intercepted by a strong German fighter squadron, and the formation dispersed, so they dropped bombs indiscriminately and fled, causing many civilian casualties in the Rennes area.</p>
<h3>Earthquake Disaster in Germany</h3>
<p>Tuttington, May 31st, Central News Agency: German news agency reports: The earthquake that occurred in Huttonburg on May 28th was even more severe than the one that occurred on May 2nd.

The chimneys of houses and factories in both places were destroyed, roofs flew off, many houses caught fire, water and fire pipes were broken, and many people were injured. Many other villages were also affected.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Air Force Attacks Chittagong, India; Fourteen Enemy Planes Shot Down in Aerial Combat</h3>

<h3>Anglo-American Seizure of Interests in North Africa</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Paris on the 22nd by special correspondent Takada) Since the withdrawal of the Axis forces from Tunis and Bizerte, the situation in North Africa has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The internal situation in French North Africa appears to be extremely complex. When the United States landed in Africa, based on the advice of Murphy, the American Consul General stationed in Vichy at the time, it first devoted all its efforts to appeasing the native population of the African colonies. However, recently there has been a considerable shortage of supplies in Africa, especially cotton products. The natives there are all Muslims and, according to the teachings of the Koran (Islamic scriptures), when a person dies, they must be buried wrapped in cotton cloth. Therefore, the shortage of cotton cloth could lead to the danger of rebellion.</p>
<p>American capitalism pays close attention to these natives. Therefore, from the time they landed in Casablanca and Algiers, they brought in large quantities of these supplies and sold them cheaply. The unwise natives were appeased and had no choice but to welcome the American army.</p>
<p>To prevent any unexpected resistance or sabotage, the American army brought in a lot of steel materials, cement, bricks, tiles, building materials, iron bridges, etc., and had thousands of locomotives. The railway from Casablanca via Algiers to Tunis was originally a single line, but since the American army landed, it has been carrying out double-tracking construction. At the same time, from the moment they landed, they promoted currency manipulation, consciously lowering the market price of the French franc against the British pound from 300 francs to 200 francs, and against the US dollar from 75 francs to 50 francs. Even today, they are still trying to maintain this artificial price stability. The Jews took advantage of the situation and began to speculate. The American Maritime Insurance Company recently lowered the maritime insurance rate for ships heading to Africa. These actions are clearly not just for military necessity. In fact, American capitalists, especially the Morgan banking group, are making huge investments. Poss, the former General Manager of the French Commercial and Industrial Bank, recently obtained a loan from the Morgan banking group and established a Commercial and Industrial Bank in North Africa, serving as its General Manager, engaged in unifying the finances of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. At present, British capitalism is clearly under the United States and has no choice but to follow in its wake. The opposition between de Gaulle and Giraud clearly shows the battle arising from the unequal competition for interests between the United States and Britain in the face of new colonial possessions.</p>
<p>De Gaulle is a puppet representing British interests, and Giraud is a puppet representing American interests. Besides the relationship between their behind-the-scenes manipulators, personal incompatibility is also a reason for their opposition. Before the fall of France, de Gaulle was just an unknown figure. He was a mechanization army theorist who wrote books discussing the need for the mechanization of the army, but the French military department only regarded him as a theorist and did not adopt his suggestions, and his personal qualifications were not enough. Giraud and Weygand were both senior members of the French army and were purely military types. Since de Gaulle fled to England, he has leaned to the left, while the elderly Giraud remains conservative. For this reason, the opposition between the two is manifested in all aspects and can only wait for Anglo-American intervention. One of the things they are currently arguing about is the operational policy of the 300,000-strong army that is being trained in Africa and will be completed by the end of May. The most experienced in this army are the de Gaulle faction, who have fought on the battlefield for a long time, but Giraud wants to use this army as a Praetorian Guard in case of a return to the French mainland, while de Gaulle advocates using it only when Britain and the United States carry out a landing operation at a location other than the French mainland.</p>
<p>The opposition between the two can also be seen in the issue of the whereabouts of Berrouton, the former French Minister of the Interior who fled from Vichy to Africa. Berrouton had served as the Governor of Algeria and Tunisia, had rich experience, and was deeply loved by the natives. Giraud did not want to appoint him as the Minister of the Interior, while de Gaulle strongly opposed it. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, May 24)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Economic Offensive Against Spain</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Madrid on the 21st by special correspondent Oshima) The end of the North African campaign and the situation in Europe and the political situation have also caused great fluctuations in Spain.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are working extremely actively in Spain. First, they expanded their embassies, established propaganda departments, and equipped them with more than 2,000 personnel to carry out organized propaganda, engaging in breaking up pro-Axis figures and spreading discussions. At the same time, they are also using anti-German politicians and soldiers from third countries who are passing through or staying in Spain, with propaganda expenses reaching millions of pesetas. The economic work is even more noteworthy. Taking advantage of Spain's eagerness to recover from the exhaustion of the civil war, they are carrying out various pressure tactics. This year, they have imported tens of thousands of tons of cotton. Besides aviation fuel, Spain is now the number one importer of oil and heavy oil in Europe. When the UK issues navigation certificates for the trade agreement between Spain and Argentina, which includes 2 million tons of wheat and other items such as meat and tobacco, it loosens and tightens the certificates, adding threats, and is extremely cunning. For example, when Chief of State Franco mentioned cooperation with the Axis in a speech, the imported materials would disappear from the outside the next day, and various rumors would follow. Compared to the situation a year ago, when Spain was suffering from a shortage of food, bread, crops, and daily necessities, there has been a significant improvement.</p>
<p>Bread, meat, sugar, wheat, butter, oil, coffee, coal, etc. only have a nominal rationing system, and there are no restrictions on clothing, etc. Since last December, buses have started running again, and the production of fish and eggs is very abundant, and the market prices of fruits, etc. have also fallen.</p>
<p>The war debts owed to Germany and Italy during the civil war have been largely repaid. General observation shows that 60-70% of the scars of the civil war have been healed. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, May 24)</p>
<h3>Navy Soul (6)</h3>
<p>— By Ariu Shen Qing of Ueno Mountain</p>
<p>Morning 4:00 AM on a certain month and day. Departed by large motorboat to Narukami Island for regional investigation. If we encounter the fishing season for Dog Salmon and Red-Eyed Salmon, we also want to catch a lot of fish. Sergeant, investigators, fishermen, plus me, a total of twenty-five or six people. Especially good weather. Investigating near Kunikawa is the next step toward Beijia Bay. The coxswain shouted loudly, "Submarine!" Everyone knew that it was a sign of enemy ships coming to attack, but the soldiers were preparing for battle. All we have are rifles, and it's a very small boat. The surface speed of the enemy submarine is fifteen or sixteen knots. The distance between us is about 3,000 meters, but it suddenly appeared in the black waves. Everyone felt that they were about to be buried in the depths of the Aleutian Sea. "It's a big enemy! So happy! Charge up! I haven't seen the enemy for a long time!" This was the soldier's voice. Suddenly, two planes flew in the sky at that time. Our reconnaissance plane suddenly dived, wanting to engage you slaves in aerial combat. The submarine did not enter the water by mistake; it turned out to be Japanese. What a joke, it turned out to be our own people. The soldiers were relieved. At that time, my mind was thinking that I had picked up a life. (One page of diary) (Tao translated from the Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Chinese Suspects in Zhang Jinhai Case Not Prosecuted by French Authorities</h3>
<p>In the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, the principal culprit, French patrol officer Mireille, is being tried by the French Consulate's court according to French law, and a fair legal resolution is expected. However, the Chinese suspects Guo Shiyuan and others who assisted in the beating and incited the crime, after being transferred to the Second Special District District Court, have not been prosecuted by the French authorities, resulting in repeated delays. It is rumored that the French Police Department will not prosecute the three suspects Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng. A Central News Agency reporter inquired about this matter with the Second Special District District Court yesterday, and the court stated that as of yesterday, the official French prosecution had not yet been received, so it is difficult to determine whether Guo and others are on the list of those to be prosecuted. However, it was found that the court's prosecution had opened a hearing in the case and believed that Guo and others were indeed suspected of committing a crime. Yesterday morning, Chen Bingjun, President of the Second Special Court, and Shen Wenjie, Chief Justice, jointly paid a visit to Luo Junqiang, Minister of Judicial Administration, to seek instructions, and whether the hearing can proceed on the 4th remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>Mr. Shen Xinqing's 80th Birthday Celebration; Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>

Today at 3:00 PM, the celebration will be held in the auditorium of the Pudong Native Place Association on Chengdu Road and Avenue Edward VII. Mr. Shen's treasured calligraphy couplets and fan paintings will be on public display all day. Mr. Shen has never written on folding fans in his life, and this time he has made an exception at the request of others, writing only 20 pages. One side of each fan has been contributed by contemporary masters such as Tang Dingzhi, Xia Jiancheng, and Bai Jiao, with paintings of pine, plum, orchid, and bamboo, making them quite valuable. All proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the Hongying Library. The exhibition will only last for one day, and a unprecedented event is expected.</p>
<h3>Quick Look at the Calligraphy of Mr. Shen Xinqing, Celebrating His Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Retiree</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Xinqing of Wuxian, a respected senior figure in the education community, has had his moral character, literary achievements, and life stories extensively reported in various newspapers, so I don't need to repeat them. This time, for his 80th birthday celebration, leaders from various sectors, because Mr. Shen has dedicated his heart and soul to maintaining the Hongying Library for nearly 20 years, are taking Mr. Shen's aspiration as their own, using the birthday celebration to fund the Hongying Library, initiating a public celebration, benefiting society and future generations, which can be said to be an immortal grand event. At the same time, at the suggestion of the organizing committee, Mr. Shen was asked to write 100 couplets and, exceptionally, 20 folding fans, which will be publicly exhibited on June 1st at the Pudong Native Place Association, and Mr. Shen agreed. The day before yesterday, I drove to the Hongying Library to visit the Shen Xinqing Birthday Celebration Committee and the financier, and was told that the寿辰 had all come to an end and had been released with each other, and finally 　　　　　　　　怏. Now I will record my impressions and inform the general readers who admire Mr. Shen and want to obtain his calligraphy as a souvenir.</p>
<p>(1) Couplets: There are a total of one hundred and two pairs. Five and seven characters are the most common. The styles include seal script, clerical script, regular script, and cursive script, with regular script being the most common, and seal script and cursive script being less common. Most of the couplet phrases are collected from Li She's poems, and the Longmen couplets collected from Song lyrics were written by Mr. Shen at the age of 79 and are very neat. Mr. Shen's calligraphy is derived from 入王, and has a unique style. The regular script, such as No. 21, "剖心输丹云胸肊达时地气思经纶," No. 20, "惠施不肯千万乘, 范子何曾杀五湖," and No. 71, "心事有谁能会得, 流光容易把人抛," are especially liked by the author. The large cursive script, such as No. 32, "化于天地外, 寄情在山水间," No. 74, "无事于此静坐, 有情可以长生," No. 73, "美人胡爲　秋水, 先生有道出　　," and No. 75, "白云过相　, 靑天若可捫," has a grand and swirling momentum and is very majestic. The clerical script, such as No. 62, "往事知何处, 此乐与　同," and No. 58, "人生爲逆旅, 问事不关心," reveals the natural interest of brush and ink in its simple and ancient charm. The seal script, such as No. 70, "曾经沧海难爲水, 落尽闲花不见人," No. 69, "秋爱冷吟春爱醉, 水爲心地玉爲　," No. 66, "独圣淸天下, 岳立冠人曹," No. 77, "挥手折若木, 飞剑决浮云," and No. 78, "她非黄石老, 煎作济南生," is either neat or unrestrained, and is above Zhang Taiyan.</p>
<p>(2) Folding Fans: There are only twenty pages in total. Seal and clerical script account for four or five pages, regular script is the most common, and there is only one page of cursive script, which is a back-copied Seventeen Posts, full of spirit, with neat lines and no sloppiness in any stroke. One buy of the small regular script is actually double-lined, from beginning to end, with every word being divine. It is quite rare for an 80-year-old man to do this, and Mr. Shen has never written fans in his life, so this is undoubtedly a difficult thing to ask. There is no shortage of people with a fondness for collecting pairs, but there will be no fan paintings by the elderly Shen Ruoying, and now is a precious, memorable, and unique opportunity. One side of the fan page was also obtained by the 公视沈寿 of the 备委员会 requesting the paintings of famous artists such as Tang Dingzhi, Xia Jiancheng, and Bai Jiao, which is even more beautiful. Mr. Tang and Mr. Xia are famous for their landscapes, and their flowers are extraordinary. Mr. Bai Jiao paints in the style of the Cao family, and has always been known as a master of writing, and most of the 20 fan pages are also written.</p>
<p>It is said that the proceeds from the public exhibition of Mr. Shen's calligraphy will also be used to fund the Hongying Library. As for the pricing, each couplet with frames in regular script is 200 dollars, without frames 100 dollars, cursive without frames 200 dollars, with frames 300 dollars, seal and clerical without frames 300 dollars, with frames 400 dollars. Each page of the folding fan ranges from 500 to 1,500 dollars.</p>

<h3>Economic Circle: Commentary: Dragon Boat Festival and Credit Crunch</h3>
<p>Recently, the industrial and commercial sectors of this city have felt a credit crunch, insufficient funds, and sluggish turnover. Some say that this is a normal phenomenon that occurs every year before the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar and is not surprising. However, in this extraordinary period, the usual financial seasonal 脱素 does not seem to apply.</p>
<p>Others say that the successive harvesting of silkworms, lotus roots, wheat, broad beans, rapeseed, and other crops in the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang requires a large amount of cash for various factories to send people to the countryside to purchase them, which is another reason for the credit crunch. However, this explanation only applies to normal times, not to this extraordinary period, because this year's purchase of spring crops is not much different from last year's.</p>
<p>The real reason for the current credit crunch is probably the change in the loan policy of the national banks. It is said that the Central Reserve Bank, in order to assist the National Government in stabilizing prices and ensuring the livelihood of the people, has recently been actively withdrawing loans from the interbank market. As a result, various同案banks and firms have also had to actively withdraw loans or overdrafts from customers who hoard goods, or reduce the amount or shorten the term of their overdrafts. Customers who hoard goods have had to sell their goods for cash due to credit relations, so the wholesale prices of various goods have shown a downward trend recently. As wholesale prices continue to fall, retail prices also tend to fall accordingly.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the central bank's prudent and tight loan policy is indeed an effective means for curbing hoarding, stabilizing prices, and ensuring the livelihood of the people. It is hoped that the bank authorities can persevere and not be moved by seemingly plausible rumors, so as not to change their current prudent loan policy.</p>

<h3>After the Establishment of the Joint Cooperative, the Original Rice Guild Ceases Activities</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the wartime system, stabilize the people's food supply, fulfill military needs, and prevent speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering, the Ministry of Food, based on the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice and Grain Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui," formulated the "Organizational Charter for Municipal and County Rice and Grain Joint Cooperatives" and supervised rice merchants in various locations to organize accordingly. Recently, the Ministry of Food issued a notice to the Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales Office of the Su, Song, Chang, and Jia districts, stating that the rice and grain joint cooperatives in all counties under its jurisdiction have been formally established in succession. Other districts will also begin preparations to ensure that rice and grain buying, selling, transportation, and sales in all locations are brought into order, and that there is no shortage of food for the people or military supplies. In areas where municipal or county rice and grain joint cooperatives have been established, the original rice industry guilds in cities, counties, townships, and towns, as well as all organizations similar to rice industry guilds, should be automatically dissolved and cease all activities. Matters concerning the public welfare of rice merchants will be temporarily handled by the rice and grain joint cooperatives in accordance with Article 16 of the "Organizational Charter for Municipal and County Rice and Grain Joint Cooperatives." After receiving the order, the special office has notified all county rice and grain joint cooperatives to comply.</p>

The market will designate the Chinese Paper Industry Association to be responsible for the collection and remittance of the tax. The attached pond construction donation will be suspended from today. The tax rate for imported native paper will remain at 5% as before, and there will be no re-taxation on exports.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Call Loan Rate: Yesterday, the call loan rate of the Money Guild remained at two jiao, and there was still a slight easing of credit.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: The selling price per tael of jewelry gold at the counters of major jewelry stores in the city has reached the limit price. Transactions within and outside the industry are not active, but prices are slightly firm, although people's minds are still unsettled. Transaction prices for jewelry silver within and outside the industry remain at the checkpoint, and transactions are not active.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The old bond market has slightly turned firm and expensive again, due to the rising gold price and the resulting firmness of people's minds. Yesterday, Class C bonds trended downward immediately after opening, and fluctuated for a long time in the middle before rising near noon. The final price was several yuan higher than on Saturday. The remaining four classes saw little trading.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: Transactions in cotton yarn remain extremely scarce, with only slight trading in 20-count yarn. Only a few transactions were seen in 10-count yarn, but fine yarn saw some trading, with prices slightly firmer than last week.

<h3>Friendship</h3>
<p>— Bu Jian</p>
<p>A person who doesn't understand friendship is not only seen as a cold, aloof, and unpopular person by others, but also feels trapped in a "cold palace."</p>
<p>A person with rich friendship can not only taste the sweetness of life, feel as comfortable as eating candied fruit and swimming in a spring sea, but also promote the excitement of work and the success of their career.</p>
<p>The formation of friendship is relatively easy. Familiarity can be established through an encounter, a chat, or a banquet. But everyone knows that it is not easy to achieve deep, intimate, and lasting friendship, and being able to do so is true happiness.</p>
<p>Many friendships are built on monetary interests. Once there is a slight disturbance in interests, they will "turn against each other" and tend to break down.</p>
<p>Some friendships are superficial. When they meet, they flatter each other—thinking that such humility and politeness are the smartest way to maintain friendship. In fact, when faced with difficulties and obstacles, they cannot actively help and sincerely encourage each other.</p>
<p>True friendship must not be based on selfishness but on a common cause. Only such friendship can withstand adversity, setbacks, and maintain permanence, promote work, and complete careers.</p>
<h3>Mr. Shen Xin's Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>Brilliant south pole shines on the southern sky, a pillar of literature in the central plains stands firm.</p>
<p>Early attainment in Confucian studies, the attainment of virtue, once aboard a boat with examination success;</p>
<p>Talented students leaping like dragons from the public door, blessed land, even dogs are immortal,</p>
<p>Eight generations reviving decline, leaving an old elder, may your long life reach a hundred years.</p>
<p>Repeating the Previous Rhyme</p>
<p>Leaving a corner of the southern sky, cultivated in obscurity, his heart is firm,</p>
<p>Once presented plans to stabilize the nation, now only enjoying old age with painting boats.</p>
<p>Respected as a village wine elder among his peers, now seen as a roaming immortal in his old age,</p>
<p>Raising a cup, I dare not follow the customs, donating gold to Buddha, ashamed of my meager strength.</p>
<p>China Confucian Society</p>
<h3>Ode to President Shen Xinqing on His Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— China Confucian Society</p>
<p>Profit-seeking thrives, moving further away from the past, as the examination system arises, scholars lack practice, empty words are adorned, habits become increasingly superficial, disasters are brought about, when will they return? Lofty is Mr. Shen, with great prestige, the old learning perfects himself, the new learning perfects others. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, seeking customs from the east, starting with horse bones, hearing the rooster first; his plan is for students, the beginning of elementary learning, form, meaning, and sound, both refined and familiar; consulting scriptures and history, awakening the sleeping, writing articles, returning to simplicity, occasionally speaking of poems, tasting sweeter than meat. Serving as a staff member once, in charge of civil affairs, government and industry, assisting and supporting; planning education, hand-drafting grand rules, presiding over association affairs, worthy of the name at the time, retiring after success, not diminishing his efforts. Establishing Humanities Pavilion, laying the foundation for outstanding talents, day by day, month by month, until now, the function of books, almost like insight, selecting only the refined, collecting without being bored, Confucianism is the foremost, Confucius is the wooden bell, Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity are the same, all streams flow to the same ravine, analyzing can be five, the sea is the same spoonful. Mencius said, when scriptures are rectified, the people flourish. All of your achievements are a model for the world, throwing the old wood to seek office, the East Sea awaits clarity, we respect simplicity, and truly serve as the chief ally, may your life be boundless, a thousand years is just beginning.</p>
<h3>Strange Stories of the Japanese Navy (6)</h3>
<p>— Oshita Udarou</p>
<p>(8) Fast Walking</p>
<p>Stations are often crowded, so there is propaganda calling on people to walk at a normal pace and not get confused. That is because the average person does not have the "five minutes before" cultivation in the navy, (Five minutes before is a traditional spirit in the Japanese navy, meaning to prepare everything within five minutes), and when they arrive at the station, everyone rushes forward, pushing aside the old, weak, sick, and disabled to get ahead. In order to restrain such unruly people, promotional methods are used to call on everyone to maintain order. A certain lieutenant on the destroyer 〇〇〇 had not been ashore for a long time. One time when he went ashore and arrived at the station, he saw that completely unfamiliar state and showed a very strange expression.</p>
<p>On board the ship, everyone walks briskly up and down the ladder. Nimble as squirrels, they walk up and down quickly. Because this has become a habit, when they come to the station, they hesitate at the ladder. The loudspeaker is shouting: "Please walk at a normal pace!" The lieutenant looked around. There wasn't much of a crowd in the station. It wouldn't hurt to walk faster! But if he walked fast, he would be noticed by the station staff! He thought that a soldier doing this would be too undignified. So he could only grit his teeth and slowly walk down the ladder.</p>
<p>After being on a ship for a long time, one develops all sorts of habits, but the navy seems to have a particularly deep connection with fast walking.</p>
<p>In military schools, there is a relay race to Mount Misen on Miyajima Island, which is a famous, very hard, and intense fast walk. Not only that, but people who want to enter this school must first know that even on ordinary days, students in the school always walk briskly. The posture of walking must also be very correct. Neatly bracing their hands on their waists, they walk far and wide. This is indeed the most emphasized thing in a part of the school time.</p>
<p>Students have no free time in a day. After this class, they go to that class, moving from this classroom to that classroom, arranged without a moment to spare.</p>
<p>Speaking of the circumstances of the imperial family entering school, the life of the imperial family in school is also subject to strict training like other students, hurrying back and forth according to a busy schedule. When I was a student, I was with Prince Toshihiko Kuni. As soon as the Prince entered the main gate of the student hall, he immediately went to the self-study room on the left and self-studied with his classmates for a week. After the self-study, if it was his turn to be on duty, he would write on the blackboard with chalk, "October 8th, water, west and north 4 meters, left and right, clear." After writing, he would quickly walk up the ladder with the sound of boots, and go to the dormitory upstairs to rest.</p>
<p>The students have less than fifteen minutes from the morning bugle call to the time of lining up in the drill field. First-year students undergo rigorous training, and soon it becomes a habit. If they arrive at the drill field before the formation time, they will use the extremely short time before the formation, even five or ten seconds, to practice commands loudly, "Rest... Attention..."</p>
<p>On Sundays, everyone goes to the club to row, and the students have very little time to even chat. They all have a leisurely expression. Entrusting their lives to something great, that attitude of peace of mind, clearly floats on their actions. Outsiders see this and say that naval education is a mystery. But the existence of this school is not only the good fortune of the students but also the greatest good fortune of Japan. (Wing: Translated from Asahi Shimbun).</p>
<h3>Going to War (4)</h3>
<p>— Naval Reporting Team Member, Hamaoto Hiroshi</p>
<p>"The ship is really good!" Reserve Lieutenant Edo said in his mouth, but in his heart, he thought, don't be surprised, how should I serve on this ship.</p>
<p>This place is not as stable as the mainland in the evening, as soon as the sun sets, you can't see the road immediately. Reserve Second Lieutenant Matsumae shone a flashlight on the road and told Edo:</p>
<p>"The people on the artillery platform just now, they like to call themselves a family in the clear sky. Living in the wilderness, of course, can only look at the clear sky from afar. Living here, you unknowingly become a humorist, and at the same time, you like this attitude, so everyone likes to say whatever they want. Maybe this is often cheering themselves up in life. But in terms of action, they are all good warriors. Hey! Pay attention! There's wire netting in that place."</p>
<p>On the other side of the dark square, there was a faintly lit barrack, and from there came the loud chorus of majestic military songs.</p>
<p>Second Lieutenant Matsumae explained, "The soldiers are adjusting their energy. That's the barrack of the aviation corps."</p>
<p>The surroundings were very dark, and in the shadows, I always felt like something was hiding.</p>
<p>"How do you feel when you stand in the line of fire for the first time?" Lieutenant Edo didn't know where the question came from, and asked this.</p>
<p>Second Lieutenant Matsumae didn't intend to think about anything and smiled lightly, "I was hungry and my throat was itchy."</p>
<p>"But I envy serving on a warship, you can encounter the enemy without walking, and the food and water are always around," Matsumae said again about his experience. Talking, unknowingly, they had already arrived in front of Lieutenant Edo's dormitory, and Edo persuaded, "Don't you want to come in and sit for a while?"</p>
<p>"See you tomorrow! Because I have to be on duty at twelve o'clock, I need to sleep a little," Second Lieutenant Matsumae said goodbye like this.</p>
<p>Edo returned to the room, took off his uniform, and took out his yukata from his bag.</p>
<p>At this time, a voice came from another bed, saying, "Are you Reserve Lieutenant Edo?"</p>
<p>He thought to himself that this must be a guest who came while he was running out, so he simply replied, "Yes."</p>
<p>The guest came out from the mosquito net, dragging the rattan cane forward, while introducing himself, saying that he was a supply lieutenant going to the front aviation corps, a young officer who looked like he was wearing a student uniform, but his voice was very loud.</p>
<p>"Someone from the headquarters just sent someone to say that the warship you will be serving on has already entered the port at night, so tomorrow at seven o'clock in the morning, you have to go to the warship," he told him like this.</p>
<p>Edo thanked him and asked, "When are you leaving?"</p>
<p>"I'm also leaving tomorrow morning, I heard there's a plane tomorrow."</p>
<p>The supply lieutenant lit a cigarette and said:</p>
<p>"This dormitory, to be precise, is Dormitory No. 3. It is said that people generally call it Ichiyado-sō. There are many people like us who stay for one night. It's just like a hotel in society, but it has a different feeling of the battlefield. Anyway, the term Ichiyado-sō is very correct. Even in the moment of life and death, humans always can't forget to joke around. So maybe they rush into the line of fire without caring," he seemed to happily look around the room that had no decorations at all.</p>
<p>The next morning, the "Kurogane" commander who greeted Edo at the door was completely unlike the person he had heard about and imagined.</p>
<p>He was very burly, but his body was as white as if he had grown up in a snowy country. White, without a beard, with clear eyebrows and beautiful eyes, I felt a sense of refreshingness. His clothes were also very elegant, and his feet wearing long socks and white shoes were slenderly stretched out. When Edo performed the arrival ceremony, the commander bowed politely.</p>
<p>"The journey was so long, it must have been hard—come over here and cool off!" Saying that, he led Edo to the canvas chair on the front deck.</p>
<p>Then the commander began to explain.</p>
<p>The boat had just entered the port the night before and had received orders to depart tomorrow. Although it was only a one-day stopover, all the crew members were busy replenishing ammunition, fuel, food, fresh water, etc. Not being able to wash their sweaty clothes during the landing was a big regret for the soldiers, but this is war, so it can't be helped. Words caring for the soldiers also overflowed his words.</p>
<p>But the other soldiers also never slacked off. Some were brushing the deck, some were washing equipment, and some were hammering nails on the damaged chairs. The soldiers looked energetic and busy working. But when they passed by the commander and the newly appointed artillery officer who were discussing work, they respectfully saluted. You couldn't feel the "Kurogane Family" feeling that others said, but just felt solemn.</p>
<p>"Call the senior lieutenant!" The commander said to the orderly like this.</p>
<p>The summoned lieutenant saluted the commander respectfully first, "What's the matter?" He didn't look like a heroic warrior with the third degree of kendo.</p>
<p>Two eyes are beautiful like those of a maiden officer.</p>
<p>"Is the bed in the room empty?"</p>
<p>The commander wanted to place the new artillery officer in that room.</p>
<p>"The artillery officer's luggage has already been moved over. The anti-heat uniform has also been prepared." This is what the senior lieutenant said to Edo.</p>
<p>"Thank you—"</p>
<p>The commander rewarded his subordinate with these words, stood up, and said:</p>
<p>"I'll take you to see the inside of the boat!"</p>
<p>The narrow bridge was also cleaned up very cleanly.</p>
<p>"How do you think this is? This is my new design."</p>
<p>The commander said this while walking up to the platform and opening part of the cover above. Only that part was locked with hinges, and suddenly opening it, you could see the blue sky.</p>
<p>"When enemy planes come, you look out from here. I tried to take the canopy down as much as possible, but it can't be done like that." He slightly expressed his heroism, and then pointed to the small room behind the chart room and said, "This is my villa."</p>
<p>Peeking in, on the narrow wall were posted charts of enemy aircraft types. Next to it was a very strange photo of a person in a frame. It was a faded old photo. It was a handsome man wearing a white old-style Japanese dress and sporting an ancient square beard.</p>
<p>"Commander. This is Elder Kiyomizu Kakurō, right!" Edo asked like this.</p>
<p>"You know that, ha-ha! Haha!" The commander said this and burst out laughing. (Write: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>Symposium on Elderly Welfare (1)</h3>
<p>— Initiated by this newspaper's social service department</p>
<p>This service department, respecting the spirit of honoring the elderly, invited well-known individuals who have always been enthusiastic about the welfare of the elderly, as well as practical workers from elderly care organizations, to hold a symposium on elderly welfare at Jue Lin Vegetarian Restaurant the day before yesterday. More than 30 people participated, including Gao Fengchi, Zhang Yipeng, Ding Fubao, Sun Houzai, Feng Yangshan, Zhao Ximing, Sun Choucheng, Zhu Juefo, Zeng Gongye, Wu Zai, Zhong Shoushen, and Xu Zhuodai. First, Chairman Huang Jingwan reported the significance of the meeting, briefly stating:</p>
<p>Honoring the elderly is an inherent virtue in our country, but society rarely pays attention to the impoverished and helpless elderly. This newspaper's social service department intends to launch a 100,000 yuan old-age assistance fund-raising campaign. Donations from all walks of life will be used to help the hidden poor and helpless elderly and distributed to elderly care organizations to solve the problem of old-age care. Regarding elderly associations, similar organizations have existed in the past, but most of them gather celebrities and hold periodic banquets without any practical achievements. It is hoped that future elderly associations should seek welfare for the entire elderly community. Then, each person present spoke:</p>
<p>(1) Old man Ximing reported on the living conditions of the elderly in charitable organizations, saying: There are only five to six hundred elderly people in charitable organizations and religious organizations in Shanghai that accommodate poor elderly people. Among them, the old-age homes and Xin Puyu Tang run by the Catholic Church are the most well-run. The number of elderly people accommodated accounts for almost half of the total number of poor elderly people in Shanghai. It is hoped that in the future: (1) The old-age care institutions run by the Haiyu Charitable Organization, namely the Baoan Old-Age Home, the Disabled Factory Old-Age Care, and its branch halls, and the five disabled old-age homes of the Cilian Relief Association's Old-Age Department, can be unified, divided into male, female, and disabled sections, and cared for and educated separately. (2) The five institutions run by Christianity, namely Jiangwan Rende House, Nanxiang Old-Age Home, Beiqiao Cihui Group, Baptist Old-Age Hall, and Yushi Old-Age Center, can be combined into one and actively expanded, and the Salvation Army, known for its spirit of service, can be hired to manage it, so that it can be on par with the Catholic Church's poverty and old-age welfare undertakings. (3) It is hoped that the two poverty and old-age care institutions under the Catholic Church can be merged, also divided into male, female, and disabled sections, and taught light production skills every day to eradicate their laziness and make full use of their talents. The elderly can also produce for society.</p>
<h3>Trainees Save Money to Help Refugees in North China</h3>
<p>(Letter) Recently, from hearing and reading newspapers, I have been impressed by the appeals of enthusiastic people for the disaster victims in North China and the quick relief efforts of those who bravely do what is right. I feel ashamed, because we are trainees. We lack strength and have no savings. It can be said that our hearts are willing, but our strength is insufficient. The other day, I was tied up in Qunxing and wanted to go to the Great Light Theater to watch a show, but unexpectedly it was sold out. I wanted to rush to another theater to make up for it. At that time, I remembered the disaster in North China and couldn't bear to enjoy myself idly. Now I offer the collected 30 yuan to be collected on our behalf. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is of no help, but it only expresses our sincerity to the utmost. Sincerely, Trainee Long Yaohuai.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhang's Invention of a New Treatment for Sha</h3>
<p>Sha is a disease from which few children can escape. According to old Chinese customs, improper care for sha often resulted in a high mortality rate. Now, Dr. Zhang Juying has invented a new external spray treatment for sha, which is a most modern and effective therapy. He has also written "A New Treatise on Sha," which explains it in detail and is a good reference book for patients. The doctor's clinic is located at No. 14 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road. All are welcome to visit and inquire.</p>
<p>"Lecture on Confucian Learning" The Chinese Confucius Learning Society, located at No. 954 Avenue Edward VII, will hold the second session of the "Lecture on Confucian Learning" on the first day of the month from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Mr. Yao Minghan will be invited to lecture on the "Classic of Filial Piety," and Mr. Yang Jianxing will lecture on the "Great Learning." All are welcome to attend.</p>
