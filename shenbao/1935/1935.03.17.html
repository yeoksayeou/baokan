<p>— 萍</p>
<p>我國銀行之按年編製營業報吿縷述一年來國內外之經濟狀况以及該行業務工作情形印送於各股東者除中國上海兩家外近復有金城銀行接踵而起中國上海兩家我人固知其同隸於江浙系銀行旗幟之下其投資及放欵興趣似亦以上海爲中心而側重於長江流域至若金城則不然其總行設於天津位居於北四行系（卽指該行與鹽業中南大陸等四家）之中堅而隱執華北金融界之牛耳故其事業活躍之見於事實者亦微有不同際此華北局勢嚴重之今日而該行有此營業報吿書之公表其意義之深長固不待言也</p>
<p>該行營業報吿書之昭示於我人者金城銀行固不僅爲一普通商業銀行蓋自其放欵業務分析觀察除一般工商業務外其動向似側重於交通事業與礦業礦產品之輔助此兩項放欵之合計約佔總數之五之一其成分之高恐非其他任何銀行所能比擬夫鐵道礦業之盛衰爲全國工商業命脈之所繫該行當局之獨具隻眼致力於此項事業之輔助其有裨於國民經濟當非淺鮮今者政府當局於舊路整理漸見端倪新綫修築亦積極進行而各地礦商尤多努力整頓以謀復興我人際此時日對於素持輔助路礦事業之該行當局期望尤切冀其於普通銀行業務而外務以發展路礦爲今後之職志若此則我國專業銀行之基礎可望樹立卽其成效亦較諸今日一般商業銀行之歧路徬徨自遠勝一籌也</p>
<p>自金融方面觀察與我銀錢業競爭最烈者自屬外商銀行但以我國銀行現有之資力尙不足與彼輩以國際資本爲後盾者度長絜大故我銀行界果欲與外商銀行相頡頏而周旋於國際金融市塲者當以充實資力爲先决之條件而爲充實資力計銀行之聯合與合併尤有各國之先例可援錢莊小銀行固應勸導其聯合或合併卽大銀行其實亦宜有此準備以爲倡導若此則我銀錢業之整個陣綫可望鞏固夫銀行聯合之爲我國金融業之出路該行與北四行系各當局早見及此民十二之組織四行凖備庫儲蓄會去年又添設四行聯合營業事務所皆開我國金融界風氣之先而太平保險公司（四行及交通國華合組）之增資擴充尤爲同業合作之見於事實者然而以我人觀察數行聯合營業或猶未足以應我國金融業今後之需要最有效之辦法似仍有待於再進一步之團結</p>
<p>金城銀行營業報吿書之公表尙屬初次試作然其取村之宏博分析之周密堪稱空前惟其於國內經濟情形似仍偏重於上海一隅而未能將華北經濟地位之消長天津港埠之盛衰與實業之興替予以分析透視此則在求華北之經濟研究資料者視之或不免稍有美中不足之感耳</p>

<p>德國民族乃不過爲要求自由平等而已、庶能維持民族地位、以充實發展爲歐洲中心之德國經濟與文化、使德國有餘力以挽救歐洲民族之裏落、救濟各民族之經濟及文化之危棧云、</p>

<p>哈密二次事變之一瞥</p>
<p>新疆士著民族、自漢以來、受中原文化熏陶、垂二千數百年、其新舊雜居各民族之情感、大體上實已步入融洽之階段、有時雖亦掀起微波、甚至演成星火燎原之形勢、但考其原動力、大多非發自各民族下層大衆、實出於少數頭目領袖之一念、此一念而惡、立可流血千里、如前文所述、蔓延全疆之纏變、此一念而善、亦易化干戈而爲玉帛、如本文所述哈密二次事變之起滅、</p>
<p>哈密二次事變、跡其起迄、有如驚濤駭浪、驀然襲至、忽又飄然退去、其中主角、爲堯樂博士、卽前次纏變之中心人物、當二十三年二月、馬仲英圍攻迪化、失敗南退、堯原同爲反對新政府之一健將、時在吐魯番聞訊、遂迅率殘部、退至哈密、向省府投誠、受委代理該縣縣長兼城防司令、及至八月、省府結束南疆軍事、轉念哈密爲東路重地、委任劉應頗爲行政長、徐某爲警備司令、劉先蒞哈視事、徐殆有順慮、遲至月後、始率勁旅四百餘人、進抵距哈三站之三堡、</p>
<p>堯舊與馬仲英有故、雖省府畀以重戰、然惴惴之心、究未或巳、今偵知徐軍事、更不勝駭懼、先是哈密小王聶滋爾、自幼與堯有隙、嗣沙王死後、聶滋爾襲職、與堯益相冰炭、堯雖仍充纏部伯克兼繼兵營營長、但並不到王府辦事、此次由吐返哈、且將聶滋爾衛兵繳械、聶滋爾恨甚、密派親信赴迪、求助於督辦盛世才、盛特許聶滋爾得正式襲職、幷促徐率部尅日開哈、聶派去之親信隨軍任嚮導、詎抵中途忽先逃哈密、向堯和盤托出、謂徐部來哈實欲繳堯之軍械、以問前罪、彼不忍同族被殘、故轉念急逃奉告云云、（兄弟閱牆、外禦其侮、凡信仰穆敎之民族、大多特具此種精神、）堯聞言、感駭交集、立委彼爲團長、秘令全族眷屬、送藏山中、壯丁補助纏軍、層層佈防西綫、聶滋爾適接省電、甫張襲職大紅喜報於回城、旋被堯傳至新城、責其速出黄金千兩、以備徐部軍食、聶惶然無計、遂被拘禁多日、堯旣下抗徐决心、惟恐配備不及、復佯與行政長劉應麟、慇慇議及營舍糧秣事、請轉達徐部、暫緩晋哈、容先向纏民疏通、以便一致歡迎、實則所謂疏通、乃密派頭目向纏民作種種宣傳反徐耳、纏民頭腦簡單、信以爲眞、哈薩亦隨聲附和、揚言「徐軍果進至頭堡、（距哈城一站）卽先以漢族領袖四人、開刀抗戰、若攻入頭堡、進而園城、我力不支、則决洗城退山」云云、從此滿城風雨、儼若大禍將臨、官紳以開刀人自懼、更有朝不保夕之槪、嗣官紳聯名、迭電省府、請止徐軍來哈、措詞懇切、弦外之音、隱謂堯部已可負責、商會會長某、復親詣軍營、求徐萬勿急進、但以堯歡迎代表在側、究未敢直吐實言、徐軍進至二堡、空氣驟形緊張、幸省府止電適至、幷派一漢回哈組之代表團、由外籍顧問某率領、乘二汽車來哈、堯優禮有加、並設盛席相欵、顧問醉飽之餘、令堯繳軍械、堯唯唯聽命、漫指纏兵數人曰、「某爲旅長、某爲團長、此後軍權盡解除、專理縣事亦大好、」顧問不知虛實、方慶大功成於反掌、堯復再繳縣印、自却縣長戰、代表等益覺釋然、促堯集部曲點騐、堯初以無權對、繼有纏哈民兵、一擁而入、驟囚代表等、並沒其車械、至此顧問等始知中計、驚駭萬分、允立電督署、保堯升任哈區警備司令、以求脫險、堯漫應之、嗣省電「准如所請、」堯始將彼等、釋返迪化、臨別尙開一歡送大會、請留下汽車一輛、幷囑寄語督署謂、「以後請勿仇視、迅將徐軍撤回、此間風平浪靜、可無增軍必要、今旣承委哈區警備司令、當更格外努力、維持治安、」顧問等雖明知　　此行之失敗、但旣處此局勢之下、只好唯唯而去、無何、哈王聶滋爾納金二百六十兩、遂得恢復自由、而已進抵二堡之徐軍、旋亦退返吐魯番、此一幕驚濤駭浪之危局、遂歸平息、</p>
<p>堯父係湘人、母南疆纏女、（南疆纏女、間有與漢族通婚者、哈密敎規極嚴、纏族只許娶漢女、不許嫁漢人、）彼年近五十、尙納第四妻、長子名道昌、亦有四妻、中一人且爲漢女、蓋纏民多妻、依敎例平等待遇、幷無妾之身份也、鐵部顧問斯文赫定一行、東歸過哈、各機關設宴祖餞、堯尤慇慇招待、樂叙不休、某君因笑謂、「赫定乃博士、堯名亦博士、相見恨晚、無怪其依依也、」翌晨赫定匆促離哈、堯未及送別、笑謂記者日、「此老行色匆匆、蓋恐吾扣留其汽車也、」後赫定歸至甘境、復由敦煌繞入新疆、果又在古樓蘭國故址、盤桓多日始東返、可知堯之爲人矣、</p>

<p>大通社云、報載申時社十五日津電、有李杜部軍官姚有堂之女、聞雷忽起生理變化、易爲男身、並謂其人現已離京來滬之消息、事之鶻突、殆無人能信其爲事實、第大通社記者、昨晨向李杜將軍處探悉、此事果屬實在、其人現亦已抵滬、且輾轉得親與晤面、索得有關此事之照片兩幀、始信天地之大、誠無奇不有矣、亟誌其情於後、以供生理學家之研究、</p>
<p>女化男姚錦屏歷略</p>
<p>大通社記者昨晨訪謁李杜將軍、始得證實上項消息爲事實、乃赴法租界其寓處、親與會面、始悉該女化男之主角姚錦屛（非金幷）、爲河北靑縣城區中街人、今年二十歲、其父姚華亭、（有堂其號）肄業於保定軍官學校、張宗昌督魯時、曾在第八師姚韻珂部爲參謀、嗣赴吉林充警官學校隊長、瀋變發生、投効義勇軍李杜部、任吉林自衛軍第一師參謀長、</p>
<p>聞雷有感易釵而弁</p>
<p>旋因抗戰失利、卽隨軍退入俄境、繞道至新疆後、卽音訊梗絕、生死不明、故錦屛在籍、思父心切、日夜啜泣不止、女化男身之事、亦馴以發生矣、據姚錦屛之祖姚慶普（卽此次挈同錦屛來滬者）談、去年舊曆七月二十一日晚、錦屛因思父悲切、臥於小樓之床上、發聞雷聲隆然、小樓屋瓦、爲之震躍、其時錦屛卽若有所感、次日靦覥吿其母章氏謂、己身已易爲男子、母以爲戲、試隔袴探之、果觸手纍贅矣、</p>
<p>褫審視岸然偉男</p>
<p>當時全家爲之驚異不止、又據女言、晚間曾夢一老嫗向其言、爾已化爲男體、此後可以尋爾父、隨你之願、第尙須過百日後、始能將下體出視於人、否則不鮮、殆滿百日後、家人將其褫袴視之、則果岸然偉男矣、以上蓋均爲其祖姚慶普之談話、以其人之老邁樸實、當不致相欺、然其事固有類於齊東野語矣、</p>
<p>證明事實關係文件</p>
<p>記者昨晨曾親見姚錦屛其人、雖與尋常男子無異、第其人見人頗有靦覥之色、幼年似曾纏足、故尙露踡屈、耳際環孔未消、此其與平常男子不同之處、其祖姚慶普並出示記者以在未化男身前及已化男身後之照片各一幀、似足證明其事之非虛、同時尙有民國十九年當其在籍女校肄業之文憑一紙、另錄於後、其祖姚慶普又謂、當其離津前、係下榻河北小關董家胡同戚家、談及此事、鄰里爲之哄動、警務機關、亦派警前來調査、甚感麻煩、故囑記者勿以滬寓地點宣佈、</p>

<p>龍華每年春季、於淸明節相近、必有香汛一次、遊人倍於柱昔、平日公共汽車、祗有六輛對開、茲値香汛已到、原有車輛不敷支配、現新車巳到滬、故該處特於昨日起、加開龍華香汛專車、共票價仍照舊、並不增加、</p>

<p>如東方之域，都是魚鹽之地，海濱傍水，其民食魚而嗜鹹，皆各安其處，美其食，魚者使人熱中，鹽者勝血，故其民皆黑色疎理，其病最多　痬，　痬之病，由於血熱，治血熱莫如砭石，砭石者，石針也，卽磁鋒之屬，高氏之山，石如玉，可以為針，卽是砭石，故有砭石之治從東方來。</p>
<p>西方為金玉之域，沙石之處。其民陵居而多風，水土剛強，其民不衣而褐　，華食而脂肥，邪不能傷其形體，其病生於內、其治宜乎毒藥，故毒藥之治從西方來。</p>
<p>北方地高陵居，風寒冰冽，其民樂野處而乳食，藏寒則多生滿病，其治宜灸焫，灸焫就是艾灸火灼，所以灸焫之治從北方來。</p>
<p>南方其地卑下，水土濕弱，霧露之所聚也，其民嗜酸而食腐，故其民皆緻理而赤色，病多攀痺，其治最宜微鍼，所以九鍼之治從南方來。</p>
<p>中央之地平以濕，其民食雜而不勞，故其病多痿厥寒熱，其治宜導引按蹻，故導引按蹻之術從中央出。</p>
<p>國醫之五種治法，皆是神農時代所發明，自軒轅黃帝以武德四征不庭，代神農而統治中國，召集四方之英傑，明堂討論，岐伯雷公伯高等從容辨難，而診脈察色聞聲問語，診病之法始大備，肌肉膚幐筋骨經脈絡脈臟腑，營衛氣血之行，草井營俞合之穴，始得大明，著成內經一書，為醫書之祖。</p>
<p>商相伊尹，既相湯而王天下，留心民病，博采醫方，著成湯液經一書，為醫方書之祖。</p>
<p>漢太倉公淳於意，應文帝之召，以手治效騐各症，列為二十四案，奏聯朝廷，為國醫醫案之祖。</p>
<p>先師張仲景，當東漢靈帝時代，慨當時醫者各承家技，不求經旨，遇熱病則譔以冷水，寒症則火追溫計，以致死亡相繼，張姓宗族素多，十年中死亡三分有二，傷寒十居其七，感往昔之淪喪，傷橫夭之莫救，於是獨出手眼，發明治療之法，分經辨症，寒熱判然，立出三百九十七法，集成一百一十三方，為外感病治法南針，兼及雜病治療。</p>
<p>自仲景而後，唐之孫思邈王熹，金元之劉李張朱四大家，明之立齊景岳輩，清之棄薛吳王各名家，雖談火談陰談濕熱，主脾主腎主命門，各各不同，要不過補充仲景而已。</p>
<p>注釋仲景書者，前後一百三十餘家，見智見仁，不免有所偏，而真能識傷寒論真目者，衹有清賢武進鄒閏菴先生一人。</p>
<p>神農到今近五千年載，故國醫已有五千年之歷史，為世界學冠，自神農到黃帝，為醫學發明時代，至東漢張仲景出而學術始全備，唐宋到今，各大家，各名家，不過為仲景學說之補充，此國醫之歷史也。</p>

<p>客問於余曰。三一七為軒轅或歧伯之誕日耶。抑藥王間善俊之紀念耶。余曰。否否。曰。然則國醫節曷為而渭於此日耶。亦有說乎。余曰。唯唯。此日者。民十八年。因反對廢止中醫。而全國國醫藥界舉代表大會之日也。現定為國醫師者。殆欲本前此奮鬥之精神。作將來不斷之努力耳。惟是歲月不居。瞬已六年。覆按往事。有足滋人感概者。十八年三月二十二日。申報載衛生部長薛子良談話。「……現業中醫者。除少數明遠外。類多故步自封。不能為精進之研究與入進。值此科學進步。瞬息千里時代。倘仍因循坐誤。而不急起直追。吾恐知識落後。終難逃灭然淘汰例。…今後為調節國民經濟。改進中國醫藥計。應卽引導業中醫藥者。分別研究解剖學，生理學，化學，病理學，藥物學，等科目。將舊有醫藥典籍。為一有系統的整理。……」然而六載以來。故步自封者。依然在因循坐誤。寥寥之國醫各學校。雖略備書本上之解剖，生理，化學，等科。然未嘗解剖屍體也。未備化學儀器也。示曾化騐藥物也。過去之六年已矣。將來之六年如何。相期有以報從前薛氏之談話。無復負當時各界之聲援。方不枉今日這紀念也，同僨其勉旃。</p>
<h3 id="c177">為什麽要紀念三一七 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 吳去疾</p>
<p>（前言）我在神州國醫學會當個編緝員。沒有什麼大名。這一次我國醫藥兩界舉行盛大的「三一七」紀念。會中諸公要我替會裏做篇文章。我辭之不得。只好隨隨便便的說了些廢話。求當代諸鉅公指教指教。</p>
<p>有人問我。今天國歷三月十七日。是你們國醫國藥兩界的紀念節麼。」我說。是的。</p>
<p>又問你們舉行這個紀念節。有什麽意義。</p>
<p>我說。你沒有看見近來教育界十大教授所作「中國本位的文化宣言」麼。那篇宣言中。不是有這樣三句話麼。（一）檢討過去。（二）把握現在。（三）創造將來。我們這回發起紀念這「三一七」節。也就是這個道理。」他說。我倒要聽聽你說這個道理。</p>
<p>我說。你若不怕麻煩。請聽我逐一的說來。</p>
<p>（第一）檢討過去。　當民國十八年的時候。有一部份西醫。要試騐他們的科學醫法。主張把中醫藥廢掉。我們在上海一般同志。看簽名簿這種情形。不大妥當。便馬上聯合起來。組織一個全國醫藥團體總聯合會。於是年三月十七日成立。一面向政府請願。保存固有的醫葉。一面集合海內外同志們。一致奮鬥。那個時候。真有登高一呼衆山皆應之勢。弄到後來。中醫中藥，雖然是幸而保存。然而因為醫藥團體，一同聯合組織。與現行法令不合。因此全國醫藥團體總聯合會宣告解散。我們醫藥兩界。經此挫折。無形之中。不知要損失多少力量。這是令人值得注意。不可以不追溯的。</p>
<p>（第二）把握現在。　自從全國醫藥團體總聯合會解散之後。中央政府雖然是順從民意。設立了一個國醫錧。但是他的職權。只能研究學術。在政治上沒有勢力。去年秋天。立法院諸公，曉得我們本國的醫藥。實在是有價值。不可偏廢。當卽通過一種中醫條例。送到行政院。因為某種關係。這項條例。依然是立而不行。醫界各同志。也有上書請願的。也有晉京請願的。還是不能邀准。那末。我們國醫國藥。在政治上的憑藉。既然是這樣的薄弱。何以還能上社會上立得脚住。這是什麼緣故呢。咳。我們要曉得。這就是我們的自力啊。我們的自力。在醫界一方面。是有治病之特長。在藥界一方面。是藥物有不可思議之效力。這兩種事實。就是我們自力的真憑實據。這們琮要曉得。現在的時代。是個生存競爭的時代。我們要想永久的存在。非運用我們現有的自力。脚踏實地的做去不可。</p>
<p>（第三）創造將來。　創造兩個字。本不容易做到。況且醫藥的事。尤其是難之又難。但是我國有句成語。天下無難事。只怕有心人。法國拿坡崙一世也曾說過。法國字典中。沒有難之一字。我們醫藥兩界。這幾年來。經過了許多時候的風浪。心中都有所覺悟。所以常聽到整理中國醫藥的論調。這是多麼可喜的事啊。我想整理我國的醫藥。書面上的工夫難不可少。最緊要的。還是下層工作。何以故呢。書面上的工夫。不過發揮我們醫藥的真理。實傳我們治療的效能。這種是學問方面的研究。普通的人感不到興趣。他們所需要的。就是生了一種病。能夠由醫生馬上替他治好。這是他們所最歡迎的。我們的醫藥。本來已得民衆的信仰。如果再從下層工作著實下一番工夫。使得社會上的人們。個個都覺得治病服藥。非我要自已的醫藥不可。那時節我們的根基穩固。人家就是要想推倒。也沒有法子好想了。</p>
<p>我對於三一七的感想。是如此如此。你說對不對。</p>
<p>那個人聽了。點頭微笑。一句話都不講。就此走開。</p>
<p>我就把這番問答。筆記出來。作為我做的文章。請諸公原諒及指教。</p>
<h3 id="c178">對於醫藥界今後希望 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 俞同芳</p>
<p>三一七「國醫節」。本市中國醫藥六團體.聯合舉行紀念會。並擬就實施計劃逐步進行。是誠中國醫藥復興之標的。國民健康之運動也.夫我國醫藥。二十年來。因遭外力侵襲.暄賓奪主。大受打擊。對於發展方面。不能長足進步。誠迫於勢耳。縱觀世界各國。方以研究中國醫藥。為新發現之寶藏。採買中國藥材。製成新藥。轉售我國。利權外溢。不可勝數。今者農村凋敝。都市肅條。失地未復。國難日亟。茲屆我醫藥兩界同仁。聯合舉行三一七「國醫節」紀念大會之時。敢貢芻堯之忱。表示希望。所冀逐步進行。實現成功。同芳不禁馨香禱祝者也。</p>
<p>（甲）對於醫界方面之希望</p>
<p>（一）醫術本是仁術。創斯格者。卽以「治國救民之社會政策」為本旨。物理論云。「醫者非仁愛不可托。非聰明理智不可任。非廉潔淳良不可信。」此後對於學術。宜勤求古訓。博采新知。治療方面。須有驚人成績表示。為外醫所不能治之病。設法治愈之。若一人之力不為之。則合數人之為之。或以團體之力為之。對於貧苦民衆。宜格外衿憐。減低診金。或完全免費。以符仁術之本旨</p>
<p>（二）中國醫藥。深信治療確有實効。毋受外力之引誘。勿作騎牆之論調。本「為國醫而學國醫」之初衷。抱定「為國醫而作國醫事業」之主張。其有毁我者。笑而頷之。譽我者。亦笑而頷之。所謂「事實勝雄辯」。毋庸自護。更毋庸自豪</p>
<p>（三）中國醫藥。功効卓特。宜盡力宣傳。務使家喻而戶曉。衛生方面。隨處指導。無論公衆衛生個人衛生。時病預防。病前病後。均宜注意。勿憑一方了事。應負完全責任。</p>
<p>（乙）對於藥界方面之希望</p>
<p>（一）藥以療病。雖有良醫。若無良藥。亦醫之興藥。唇齒相關。宜相互提携。共存共榮。不可貪圖厚利。以偽亂真。泡製宜遺古法。不可因陋就簡。自墮聲譽。並希各自檢舉。互相督責。而堅信仰。</p>
<p>（二）各省地土。氣候不同。產藥各異。藥性各有所偏。治療各盡所用。所以千金論藥。首重道地。不可張冠李戴。以甲代乙。有亂國藥個性。而失治療作用</p>
<p>綜此數條。行之尚易。然必持之以恒。功効乃見。而尤要者。在我醫藥兩界。團結互助。切實聯絡。共策進行。相當政策。以破比此難局。而達到光明之途徑也。諸公以為然否。</p>
<h3 id="c179">國醫之出路安在 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 徐相任</p>
<p>為二十四年三一七紀念作</p>
<p>在業務乎，在地位乎，此皆一人一時之事，無關大局者也，愚意唯有共同努力於學術，有精確之建樹，得善逼之信仰，始是吾國醫真正之出路，凡吾同志，亟起圖之。</p>

<p>東華乙昨與西捕乙、作西聯足球初級盃决賽於逸園、東華於出人意料之外、以三比零痛擊西捕、奪得冠軍、東華以人才平均、攻守俱佳、聯絡純熟勝、西捕極形散漫、毫無合作、全憑其魁梧體格、遂爲東華所收、觀者昨日寥寥、僅數百人耳、</p>
<p>十二碼同聲嘆惜</p>
<p>西捕開球、東華以巧妙之小派司、向西捕進攻、時在西捕門前活動、但西捕以其高大之身村、頭頂肩撞、無所不作、屢試不得、東華勢亦稍减、於是西捕重兵來犯、其勢汹汹、一時東華躭憂、如此來往、約半點鐘、吳炳浩帶兵進抵西捕門前、深入腹地、陶格拉斯見勢不佳、一撞之下、豈知觸犯第九條、判罰十二碼、一時歡天喜地、由陳虞添踢去、用力過輕、出球亦低、竟爲守門撲出、全塲嘆惜、</p>
<p>吳炳浩先開紀錄</p>
<p>陳虞添坐失良機、於是羣望其能將功贖罪、十二碼失去後之十分鐘、張金海在門前十多碼、對門一脚亞倫伸脚一擋、碰成角球、陳虞添角球、此中老手、落點準確、恰到好處、吳炳浩在人後一脚、攻入門內、其不容易得破之西捕大門、到此方吿陷落、西捕雖拼命反攻、上半時東華以一比零佔先、</p>
<p>東華二比零佔先</p>
<p>下半時易地後、西捕關竭力反攻、然以缺少射門之脚頭、巧妙之聯絡、徒憑其笨拙之硬功夫、自然無濟於事、東華嚴陣以守、得機而動、互相攻守、相持至半點鐘、東華中鋒龔子文、帶球直進、西抽正在恣意亂攻、後防空虛之時、龔猛冲而進、亞倫見狀、沖出阻禦、馬律斯急忙奔入替代、龑見亞來、急傳吳炳浩、對門猛攻、馬律斯又被射落、至是東華以二比零佔先、</p>
<p>陳虞添造三比零</p>
<p>東華之勝利局面、旣已確定、西捕之反攻、亦聊以盡盡人事耳、在將終局之三分鐘時、東華竟又獲中第三球、亦出乎意外、西捕傾全力攻取、後防完全不顧、秦佐芝獲球、遂匹馬直進、向右傅陳虞添、陳對門一脚、三比零奠定江山、</p>

<p>昨日下午、優游乙與聖芳濟、作字林杯决賽於中園球塲、四座觀衆、頗形寥落、僅三四百人、聊資點綴耳、然東呼西喊、頗不寂寞、觀昨戰、兩隊旗鼓相當、實力至爲平等、競爭因而劇烈、但優游守門、傷腿半途出塲、聖芳濟乘機而攻、卒以三對二勝、榮獲字林杯、茲將當時情形、分誌於下、</p>
<p>世琦開紀錄</p>
<p>鐘鳴三下、裁判員一聲動員、戰事爆發、優游乘天時之利、旗幟常在聖芳濟腹地、縱横攻打、聖芳濟逆來順受、加意防範、二十分鐘轉瞬即逝、奚巧生截獲一球、遙送敵門前、胡有成被敵絆跌、無法施射、沈世琦見機而作、如飛趕到、碰的一聲、球由左下角而入、紀錄遂開、</p>
<p>被罰十二碼</p>
<p>優游旣勝一球、前鋒依舊耀武揚威、肆意進攻、胡有成在二十碼處得球發射、勢在必中、不料操之過急、球越横木而逸、聖芳濟危機旣解、乃乘虛進窺、中鋒比德遜、得球力射、楊守門接住、敵前鋒一湧而上、將楊包圍、楊欲避敵、一不留心、滑跌一交、滕部受重創、臥地不起、不得已乃退出塲外、由許文奎代其職、未幾、寇曼尼自邊綫挑中、正從門前從下、許守門從容躍鵝接住阿斗、正擬一脚送出、而裁判員之銀笛狂鳴、不知何故、判罰十二碼、由比德遜一踢而中、四座觀衆乃鼓噪不巳、上半時即以一對一而終、</p>
<p>比德遜再中</p>
<p>下半時開始、楊守門忍痛助戰、雙方競爭益爲劇烈、聖芳濟右翼邊陲傳中、比德遜馬不停蹄、得而即射、楊守門彳亍守門、跳躍殊感不便、眼巴巴望球進網、二對一聖芳濟佔先、而楊守門之傷腿、更覺厲害、勢難支持、不得巳乃再次出塲、缺職由石金生代替、</p>
<p>成三一之比</p>
<p>聖芳濟愈戰愈勇、優游係殘缺之軍、一任攻打、聖芳濟右翼帶球疾進、到相當地點、對門力射、準而且急、又中鴣的、造成三與一之比、</p>
<p>三對二而終</p>
<p>東隅雖失、桑楡可收、優游受此激刺、乃全軍用命、抱破釜沉舟之志、怒撲聖芳濟腹地、卒由許文奎射中一球、四幷觀衆、掌聲雷動、優游受此鼓勵、進攻之力益盛、正擬翻本、無不時不我待、一聲長鳴、宣吿結束、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<p>— 希寔</p>
<p>小朋友！你看，現在的中國，不是努力於生產的建設嗎？生產建設所需要的原料與機械，原料在中國是最富庶的。要是用著你們的兩隻眼睛！與雙手去找，到處都有，但是機械呢？機械在生產建設上是最偉大的工具。我們所需要的機械，種類很多，但是那一種機械我們所最需要的呢？</p>
<p>我們所最需要的機械，是製造機械的機械，這理由是很明白的，因爲我們有了這類的機械，其餘的機械都可製造出來了。在我們的國家裏，惟有飛機，但沒有製造飛機的機械；在我們的國家裏，惟有汽車，但沒有製造汽車的機械；諸如此類眞多着呢。因此我們不得不向外國去購買了。</p>
<p>小朋友用着你們靈巧的頭腦，活潑的雙手，努力地準備製造機械的機械。</p>

<p>— 玲</p>
<p>王兒是一個天資聰明，舉動活潑的孩子，不幸在四歲的那年，他父親一病逝世了，於是他的母親做些針黹，苦苦的養活自己和王兒，一瞬眼，王兒已是十三歲了，母親身體日漸衰弱，再不能多做針黹，想替王兒找一件事情做做，以維持生活，所以四方托人替伊的兒子找事，但找了一月，二月，三月……一些事也沒有找到，於是他的母親着急了，在一個寂靜的夜裏，伊翻來覆去的睡不着，在微風吹動樹梢颼颼的聲音中，便想着了一個計劃，還是賣報吧。後來伊决定了這個計劃，在太陽未升起來的時侯，伊把這個計劃吿訴了兒子，伊的兒子也答應了。於是他的母親說了許多好話，向鄰居借到了一些錢，做賣報的資本，從這天起，王兒爲了生活，每天出外，雖然在大雨寒風中，也只得奔走着。</p>
<p>過了幾年，國家便有了對外的戰爭，他仍舊每天做他的職務，他本也稍識幾個字，所以在每日的報紙上看見印着血紅的大字，便觸目驚心，等到他每天的報分發完畢了，便坐在牆角很不舒適地看着報。他雖然不識很多的字，但已經知道中國受帝國主義的侵略，在他簡單的思想中，要想去加入軍隊。後來戰爭漸漸的緊張了，他就拋棄了職務，離別了親愛的母親，上前綫去了。於是他每天和同伴在戰地上抵抗着，奮鬥着。不幸兇惡的炸彈，入了他愛國的心窩中，於是他便犧牲了，他爲國犧牲了！在軋軋的飛機聲中，轟轟的大砲聲中，微微聽得他喊着「中華民國萬歲，萬歲，萬萬歲；……」！</p>
<h3 id="c213">動植物相同之點 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>諸君日常所見的動物貓狗，與植物的花草樹木，其生活好像大不同的，然而從實際上說起來，動物與植物的性質，原是相同的。第一，植物與動物都有雙親，植物開了美麗的花，其雄蕊花粉，吹到雌蕊中，就會結子。第二，動物與植物，都會呼吸，植物如缺少了酸素，就要枯死，動物停止呼吸立刻窒息而死。我們如用顯微鏡一照，植物有無數小穴，呼吸不停的。第三動物植物都要吃東西，動物從口內食進，植物從根幹枝葉吸收。第四動植物各有抵抗的利器，人類用拳打脚跌，貓狗用爪牙抓咬，植物的仙人掌莓粟等細針刺棘，都爲抵抗傷害的。第五，植物也要爭吵，野草蔓生，妨碍附近的植物時，鳶尾草就會捲起幹來，把野草捲斷。第六，動物愛讓子女，植物也保護種子，好像椰子的果實與栗子的針刺。第七，動物與植物都要休息，我們晨起，夜睡，植物在白天攝取營養物的到了太陽西下，停止勞動休息了。第八，動植物都有新陳代謝的機能，動物的毛髮肌膚細胞，終年不停的生長脫落，植物的根枝葉皮，也是常常凋落換新的。照這樣看起來，動物是有形的動的作用，植物是無形的靜的變化，二者的性質，是完全相同的。</p>

<h3 id="c215">蝸牛和明兒 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>明兒是立志小學五年級的學生，他的記憶力很壞，悟性也比人家差，因此他的各門學科都趕不上同班的同學。</p>
<p>先生勸告他應該耐心地用功，有幾個俏皮的同學給他取上一個「笨蟲」的綽號。明兒對於先生的勸吿，表示接受，對於同學們的惡謔，心中自不免羞憤。</p>
<p>某日，明兒偶在花園裏散步，他無意間看見土牆脚有一隻蝸牛努力地向上爬，蝸牛爬行速度是很蠕緩的，那麽長久的時間過去了，它還爬不到一尺路。</p>
<p>明兒不禁笑問道：「蝸牛呀！你莫非同我一樣的是笨蟲麽？你爬得這樣慢，還想爬到牆頂呢？」但蝸牛一聲不發，只管前進。</p>
<p>晚上，明兒再來探看蝸牛，出乎明兒意料之外，蝸牛已高高地爬上牆頂，這好像蝸牛以事實回答了明兒：「不要自餒，耐心地爬，不息地爬，笨蟲也會爬上牆頂的。」</p>
<p>明兒受了這番感動以後，他就耐心地，努力地，孜孜不息地學習各門學科，以他的苦學來補足了他的悟性和記憶力不如人的缺憾，不到幾個月，每個先生都贊賞他，同學們再也不敢喚他爲「笨蟲」了。</p>
<h3 id="c216">植物怎樣過冬天？ <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>植物須有兩件東西才能够生活，一件是適當的溫度，一件是合宜的乾濕。到了冬天，溫度低了，空氣又很乾燥，地下有時給冰凍住，沒有方法吸收水分，因此，有許多植物都枯死了。但是到了春天，他們仍舊會生出來，或活起來的。像鳳仙花，在它沒有枯死之前，早已留下了種子，這些種子，一到了天氣暖和的時候，就會重新生出來的，（一圖）。有些植物，莖和葉都枯死了，但是它們泥裏的根仍舊活着，到了明年天氣一轉暖，由這根上又生出新的莖和葉來；菊花便是這樣的。（二圖）。那些樹，它們的葉子雖然股落了，但是枝和根幹，是仍舊活着的，到了天暖的時候，又生出新芽來了，（三圖）。松，柏，萬年靑，冬靑之類，要算是最强勁的植物了，他們的葉子到了冬天，還不枯落，依舊是碧綠生靑的，（四圖）。</p>
<p>我們要有好看的樹木，在冬天必須保護它們：花草的種子要收藏在玻璃瓶內，預備天暖時下種。對於留根的植物要用礱糠，草灰，稻草等蓋在根上，使它溫暖，樹枝和樹幹要用稻草縛着，免得被霜雪和冷氣所損害，（五圖）。我們如果這樣保護樹木花草，到了天暖的時節，我們的庭園一定仍會熱鬧起來的。</p>
<h3 id="c217">氈的來歷 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>小朋友，你們知道氈的來歷嗎？氈的來歷是有一段趣味的發現史。</p>
<p>在幾百年前，外國有個行脚和尙，呌葛萊孟。這一天，他旅行到一座高山上；那山頂堆積着許多白雪和黄砂，要走過這山頭，委實是不容易的。他恐怕把脚弄痛，所以預先拿了兩塊羊毛襯在兩隻鞋子內。</p>
<p>當他走過了這座高山，脚底要覺得灼熱，於是把羊毛取來出一瞧，怎麼？羊毛已變成了一種天然的織物了。從此以後，那個行脚和尙便想出這造氈的工業來。</p>
<p>小朝友，這氈雖然很像一種織物，但却不是織成的。製氈的方法十分前單，我們只須把羊毛一層層地壓起來，使它的識維互相交疊，氈立刻可以成功了。</p>
<h3 id="c218">有翼子的字 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 楊鴻富</p>
<p>有一天，我同我的弟弟正坐在一枝大樹下的時候，忽然看見一隻小鳥飛進了一枝大樹的要面去。後來：那隻小鳥就唱了一隻歌，他唱完了那隻很好聽的歌以後，就用了他的翼子飛去了！我們心想再去看看那隻小鳥，但是他却已經用了他的小小的翼子很快的飛去了。</p>
<p>後來我們就立了起來去看另外的鳥和一隻鳥窠。不多時我的弟弟看見了一隻小小的東西定在樹枝上，他說：「那面是一隻靑色的小鳥呀！」於是我就抬起頭來一看；原來樹上是一隻靑色的蛙，他正在從這枝樹枝而跳到別枝的樹枝上去。我的弟弟看了就喊道：「呀！他也是有翼子的呀！」</p>
<p>蛙的跳躍，是不用翼子的，他們又沒有翼子。但是鳥却是有翼子的。</p>
<p>但是「字」也是有翼子的。假使你不把緊緊的捉住着，那末它們就立刻要飛去了！</p>
<p>那末：「怎樣能够把它們捉住呢？」</p>
<p>這個方法是很省力的，只要常常想想它們的意思，並且要十二分的用心去寫讀。這樣一來它們就同你一起住着了！</p>

<p>— 子系</p>
<p>瑞珍在抽屜裏找到一根蠟燭，把底面一頭，用小刀削出燭芯少許。在燭的中部，用錐刺孔，以鉛絲穿過蠟燭的中部，蠟燭能回轉自如，另用木板一方，兩端豎立兩根竹爿，頭上削出了一個圓形，把鉛絲挿在中間，再把重的一頭向下倒去，用火柴點兩端燭芯，不久，在下面的一頭，就會向上昇起，一會兒在上面的一頭，又會向下倒去。從此，一上一下不停的動，就成爲一個自動蹺蹺板了。</p>
<p>正在瑞珍高與得發狂一般的時候，伊的弟弟瑞璋却也來了，瑞章看了多時，就高興的死要問伊這個綠由。</p>
<p>瑞珍停了一歇，才很得意的說：「這因爲兩面不能平衡，重的一頭，就要向下倒去。在兩端用火點着之後，在倒下的一頭蠟燭，又多被火鎔解，較重的一頭又輕了，就向上昇起，一方就向下倒去。照這樣一上一下不停的動，豈不同蹺蹺板一樣？」瑞璋聽了，眞佩服他姊姊的聰明。</p>

<p>蔣委員長提倡的「新生活」是誰的？</p>
<p>我想：這新生活不是別人的，正是我們兒童的吧！因為新生活，就是兒童，兒童便是新生活。</p>
<p>怎說新生活就是兒童，兒童便是新生活呢？說來是一點也不會錯的，因爲兒童活潑潑地生到這世界來，有的是新的體魄，新的頭腦，新的活力，新的希望，新的生機，……在這一切皆新中，過着新的生活，那末，兒童還不就是新生活嗎？新生活也不就是兒童嗎？</p>
<p>新生活旣然不是別人的，而是兒童的，那末，我們兒童，自該一切實行自己所有的新生活，方不負自己所有的新生活。</p>
<p>我祝：現在是「兒童世界，」將來便是「新生活世界。」</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>傍晚時我們睡在海濱，但是不多一會就嚇醒過來。我聽得近邊有一種聲音。這聲音是發於棕樹般長的一尾大蛇，在我們睡熟時爬得很接近了。</p>
<p>它咬住了我一個朋友在它的大顎中，此人雖是爲了自己的性命奮鬥着，沒口子的放聲呼喊，那蛇却一會兒就喫了他了。如今我只賸了一個朋友，兩下裏駭極而逃，否則，怕我們也要供給道畜生作第二餐了。</p>
<p>我嚷着道：「我們是冒着何等的險呀！我們剛到這美島上來時，充滿着快樂，以爲我們巳脫身於那黑大漢了，不道如今却又瀕於死境！」</p>
<p>我們瞧見一株高樹，於是我們就在樹枝中間過夜。在天明之前，那蛇却又尋到了我們，又把我那最後的朋友從他坐着的樹枝上吃下去了。</p>
<p>此時我害怕巳極，好像死人一般，接着却很快樂，原來那畜生就去了。天一亮我便從樹上下來，但不知道走那條路是安全的。我先還想結果了自己的性命就完了，然而覺得生命仍是甜蜜的，因此我便信賴着上帝，開始給我做成一個安全之所。</p>
<p>我取了一大堆的樹枝和長木條，繞着找的樹做了一帶高籬。把那木條的梢縛住在樹枝上。今夜時我便藏身在我的砲台中。</p>
<p>我剛做好了這回事，那蛇又來了。它兀自盤繞着我所做的籬，却不能進來爲難我。於是他</p>
<p>下來專我出來，正好像一頭貓專着一頭鼠子一般。天明時它就離了我回到它的巢穴中去了。</p>
<p>我又弱又病，因為這畜生的氣息直使我病了。太陽升起來時，我就離村下來到海邊去，了給我的一生，可是我覺得死後比活着而如此恐怖，要甜蜜的多咧。</p>
<p>我到了海邊，却見遠遠的海面上有一艘船在着。我便把頭巾的布做了一面旗往復搖揮着，同時又將我那高呼之聲使空氣振盪起來。</p>
<p>我很快樂見那船上的人已瞧見我了，不一會便有一艘小船放來接我過去。我一上了船，就把我一切經過的事情訴說出來。當下那些人便給了我最好的食物和一套新衣服，因爲我自己的東西只賸破爛的衣塊了。</p>
<p>我們在海上過了幾時，便到那薩拉白島上。我們在港口中繫住了纜，船上的那些人本是做買賣來的，於是從艙中取出他們的包件貨物來預備出賣。</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>藝人阮玲玉的自殺，驚動了全上海甚至全國人的心靈，賺得了不少靑年男女的熱淚。這由于她在銀幕上的演技，使每個看到她作品的觀衆，作五體投地的佩服，她的扮什麽像什麽的各種姿態，深深地印入每個觀衆的心底，使他們不得忘懷。然而這樣一個天才的藝術家，受千千萬萬觀衆愛戴的影星，終不免被萬惡社會葬送了。阮玲玉只能認識藝術，不能看淸社會，不能將一切身受的苦難，社會的罪惡再借藝術來暴露于每個觀衆之前生前，這是她的失策處，也是她的軟弱處。但阮玲玉而反出於一死是偉大的，她的忠誠于藝術，努力求進，不苟且工作的精神、値得靑年男女佩服的。她的演技，誠然是天才，但天才而不加後天的努力與修養，刻苦與奮鬥，也仍淪于平庸，不但仍淪于平庸，甚或竟墮落而不能自拔的也天有人在。阮玲玉留在銀幕上的驚人藝術，决不是整個天生的。半由于她一生痛苦生活的經騐，半由于她對藝術的認眞與努力。所以她决不是以明星做幌子，過一天算一天，以享樂爲歸宿的墮落女性。</p>
<p>當南方報紙登滿了藝人阮玲玉死事的消息時，北方各報，爭載着女作家劉荷影爲娼的新聞：「劉荷影，現年十九，曾肄業于貝滿女中，性好文藝三年前已爲各小報撰文，文筆流利，淸麗可誦，旋任某小報文藝編輯與同事發生曖昧，被父驅逐，轉輾流浪，現已抽白面，且淪爲三等娼妓」。由這一段新聞，可窺知使劉荷影墮落的，亦是這萬惡的社會與封建勢力，封建勢力，使一有望的女靑年，墮入姻花，賣淫度日，但劉荷影的嗜抽白面，不再努力于寫作，難免有自甘墮落之嫌。比于阮玲玉之刻苦于藝術，半生奮鬥，鬥不勝而出于死，大有天壤之別了。然而我們仍希望有人救出她于火坑，更希望她從此用她流利的文筆，來描寫社會的罪惡，與身受的痛苦。</p>
<p>現社會是萬惡的，封建禮敎，隨處在吃人，靑年女子，在這時代，應該努力認識社會，確定自己人生，負起責任來改造這惡劣的社會，消滅封建勢力，才是正眞的出路，自殺不是出路，墮落更不是靑年女子該取的方策。眞正的出路正待能刻苦耐勞，勇往直前的女靑年去開道。</p>

<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>記得在幾年前，美國發生所謂猴子案，喧動一時。這所謂猴子案者，就是一位「不識時務」的敎授在某學校敎投達爾文的進化論，說人類的祖先是猴子，而不是什麽島的亞當夏娃。這種冒瀆聖經的言論，竟觸動了美國資產階級的憤怒，遂被處罰。這樣耐人尋味的案子，給我們提出如下的問題。</p>
<p>「到底基督敎的聖經對嗎？還是達爾文的進化論對呢？一</p>
<p>其實這個問題早在數十年前被解决了，聰明的美國資產階級也很明白進化論的眞理，那末，爲什麽反對這個眞理呢？理由很簡單，就是在他們的眼裏有利害不利審，而無所謂眞理不眞理，聚經是他們的支配工具，冒凟了牠，即是冒凟了他們的支配權！</p>
<p>自從十九世紀生物學及歷史科學昌明以來，我們知道了人類原是猿猴科的一種動物，而由進化的法則演逃到現在的人類，同時知道了有史以前的人類社會的進化過程，對於這方面的最大貢獻者，首推生物學者達爾文，其次是原始社會的發見者巴霍芬，麥克林蘭，摩爾根，昂格斯等。</p>
<p>人類的祖先是什麽？對這問題之達爾文的回答，在十九世紀基督敎統治歐美的時代，的確是叛逆的言論。據他的硏究說來，人類本來是一種動物，和其他的猿猴同樣在樹林閒採果實充飢，或捕小動物果腹，他們偶然拾得石片或木棍，拿來作採取食物的工其，從此人類對其他動物佔優勢的地位。這樣數千年因勞動工具的實踐的使用，人類的前半肢特別專門化，而終止了用以行走的任務，成了人類勞動及防衛的機關。同時因手的任務的變化而開始直立步行，人類的骨骼亦因而仲直起來。其後更由於工具的使用及製造上的責踐；勞動的社會的性質；直立步行及肉食等事情而人類的肉體的容貌完全發生變化，遂演進爲現在的人類。這樣，由動物進化到人類的過程中，最决定的基本動因，就是勞動工具的製造及使用。所以，十八世紀美國的政治家富蘭克林說：「人類是製造工具的動物」。</p>
<p>人類的祖先爲動物這件事，懂得科學的人都不會否認，除了因階級的利害關係，故意抹煞眞理的人外。</p>
<p>其次，關於原始社會的硏究，最先確立科學的基礎的人，就是糜爾根。雖然在他以前，已有巴霍芬的母權社會的發見及麥克林蘭的原始人類的婚姻制度的研究，但到了摩爾根摩把牠作成統一的體系。他在美洲土人印弟安民族中前後考究了數十年，他從「羣」，「家族」，以至「國家」的形成，詳細考察原始社會的演進過程，特別他發明母系制度和原始社會的兩性關係，對於從來宗敎的兩性問題的思想上起了很大的變革。</p>
<p>摩爾根在古代社會中，把人類的全部演進過程分爲野蠻未開，文明一個時代，而且把前一個時代再分爲初中後三期，對於每時期的人類生活狀態加以詳細的說明，在這裏，簡括的說明其內容：</p>
<p>一，野蠻時代—初期，人類棲息於一定的地域，以草根木果爲食料，但已有簡單的言語，中期，開始用火，以魚類爲食料，後期，發明弓矢，以禽獸爲食物。</p>
<p>二，未開時代初期，發明陶器，中期，開始飼育動物，栽培穀類，使用乾磚及石材，後期，發明鑄鐵與簡單的文字。</p>
<p>三，文明時代—開始使用聲音字母。製成文字的紀錄，從此開始了有史時代。</p>
<p>我們的所誚先史時代，就是野蠻和未開時代。關於這時代中的兩性的結合問題，摩爾根分爲（一）血族羣婚制，（二）半血族羣婚制，（三）對偶婚制，（四）一夫多妻制四個形態。是和上記的各階段相適應的。</p>
<p>上述的各時代，各有新的特徵，這是人類的生產手段的變遷所引起的。我們以爲生產手段的發達程度，是剖視人類社會的進化過程之尺度。摩爾根的這一見解是很偶然的吻合於史的唯物論的基本法則。</p>
<p>昂格斯繼摩爾根之後，著家族私有財產及國家之起源一書，而把摩爾根的全部硏究，加以明確的整理與說明，從此以後，從來隱藏在悶葫蘆的先史時代的人類社會情形，遂爲人們所看破，同時，明白了從來關於兩性問題與及家族制度的宗敎的解釋，都是荒唐無稽的鬼話！</p>
<p>最後，我們借倍倍爾的一段話來作本節的結語吧。</p>
<p>「略述原始時代的兩性關係，在本書的目的上是很重要的，這是我們要從此證明以下的事實與原故。就是在古代人類進化的過程中，已經因生產方法和生產物分配方法的變化而影響於兩性的關係，因此，今後生產和分配方法的變動，兩性關係也必然因之變動，不論什麼，沒有「永久不變的」，在自然界和人生都是一樣，永久不變的祇有「轉化」和一變遷」自身而巳。（婦人與社會）</p>

<h3 id="c241">怎樣做後母 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 浣英</p>
<p>我們知道歷史上有許多偉大的人物，僅由其賢母之慈愛陶冶而得—他們從小就沒有父親了的—我們也可以想到，自古至今許多貧苦的家庭中怎樣才得使他們的孩子不至因凍餒而沒絕。反之，我們可以想到沒有母親的孩子，該是怎樣的不幸了！</p>
<p>親子的關係本是自然的，惟一的，不能替頂的，爲甚麽又有所謂後母呢？這就是因爲現社會的組織尙未完善，對於撫育兒童的責任，還是整個的由其父母負擔，死了母親的孩子的父親祇得再娶一個女子來做這孩子的母親—當然也是爲着自己的需要。</p>
<p>共同生活眞不是一件容易的事體，除了相愛的夫婦及親生兒女以外，雖有，都是牽强的組成，不是愛的組合了。這種牽强組成的集團，畢竟是要發生不睦—如嫉妒，猜疑，恨惡種種的不道德行爲，尤其在現經濟組織之家庭裏；所以我常說「爲後母難，做前兒亦不易」！</p>
<p>我國婦女受了數千年來封建思想的薰淘，至今尙很少有着社會觀念，多半以兒童爲私有產物．撫育親生的孩子，除了親子之自然愛以外，還懷有ｇ　種望報酬的心理，至於撫育前兒則前項因素旣缺乏而後者又怕不可靠；所以就索性拿出狠毒的手段來虐待前兒了！事實吿訴我們：在婦女知識未開以前，做後母的其中或有些因存着宗敎觀念不敢十分虐待前兒，至於落在現在一班過渡時代的婦女，她們旣不信因果報應，而自己做人也沒有正確的認識，所以這種虐待前兒的手段就更形尖刻化了！</p>
<p>至於兒童的心理，或因耳聞目染一班後母虐待前兒的情景，對於目前目己的後母發生不敢信任的情緒也是難免的，有時他也會自制其天眞的流露，甚至他也會很慚愧地去認求這種盧僞的母子關係。</p>
<p>在現有家庭組織之下，後母和前兒，旣是如此冰炭不能相容，我們應當怎樣才能剷除這兩者之間的壁壘呢？</p>
<p>整個問題的解决，當然要期待社會組織之改良，使婦女和小孩都變爲社會人，婦女不僅担任家庭事務，也加入社會做生產的工作，小孩則交給國家所設專門機關去撫育，如是後母對前兒必然十分客氣，十分融洽，絕不如以前一樣，視之若眼中釘了；但這種美滿的未來，不是一蹴而成，正如遠水難救近火一樣！</p>
<p>爲不幸的孩子們着想，我們祇有向現有的或將近未來的後母求情：希望他們徹底改變固有的成見，認識自己是社會一份子，對於社會本來隨時隨地可盡着羲務，前兒是社會上的無吿的弱小生命，除了他的父親以外，社會已明白地指定了你的責任—代表他的母親—你就應該特別負起責任來，如同撫育親生兒一般去撫育前兒，如果做後母的抱着至公無私的决心去對待前兒，我想前兒縱是低能無義，也將被其感化而視之為親母了。</p>
<p>做後母是像做醫生和護士一般，是需要偉大的愛心的，一個盡責任的後母是堪敬佩的！</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>在中國，無論在哪個城市裏，女傭工都佔着人口上的一個不小的數目，固然有一般從鄉下出來的婦女也有不少是往工廠裏鑽，但粥少僧多，容不下去的只好另外找路。</p>
<p>在北平，工廠旣不如上海天津之多，再加上近年來農村衰落，女傭工也更多了。大街小巷時常會看到一個木牌子，上面寫着「女傭工介紹所」，并且加了「社會局」批准的註解，當所主的不是男子，而是××氏。</p>
<p>前些天曾伴了街坊去一家介紹所呌人，那是一家規模不太小的。木牌子上看紅布條兒。</p>
<p>我們走進一小條湫隘的弄堂，裏面是個長方的土地小院子、在暖暖的春陽下，站着四五個穿着深藍淺藍衣服的女人，有的在洗衣服，有的在粘鞋面。</p>
<p>「有人好送嗎？」那個街坊問。</p>
<p>一個六十歲光景的老女人笑迎了上來，雖然瘦，却顯出她的精悍，兩雙眼晴沉在眼眶下看人，笑時露出一排黄白斑剝的牙。</p>
<p>「有啊，多得很呢。」她打量着問她話的人。隨後便問幾口人，做點什麼活兒。最要緊的是多少工錢。聽到街坊的回答使她滿意時，她呶呶嘴：</p>
<p>「到屋子裏挑去吧、年紀輕，利利落」落的有的是。」</p>
<p>我們進了上房。一共是三間，一間被隔開成爲套間，小坑上圍坐着五六個男男女女在鬥紙牌，男的大槪是所主的家人或女傭們的伴送鄕親，女的也許就是手裏還不空的待雇女傭人吧？</p>
<p>那些人正興濃，只有站在地上看熱鬧的對我們瞅了幾眼。我們又回對外屋那兩個統間。</p>
<p>兩間的一半都讓一個大坑給估去了，另外一間的一小半也搭了一個很寬的橫舖。坑上和舖上都坐滿了女傭人，她們在焦急地挨着日子等待有個吃飯地方，有才從鄉下上來的枯黄寡言的女人，有花白了頭髮的龍鍾女人，有在城內轉工的油滑老練的女人。舖上則還坐着兩個帶着孩子的，孩子們啣着母親的奶，却不知道他或她還沒有享受自己母親的奶的幸福。</p>
<p>「那兩個是奶媽。」老所主說。大約是想讓事情定妥了再把孩子交人帶到鄉下貼奶吧，有現成的奶在，總不肯多花幾天貼奶錢的。而且母子們的依戀也聽她們不忍驟然分開。</p>
<p>大坑上那十八九個人在盤着腿兒聊天，手裏拿着點針綫作活計，為的遺悶而已，雖然也有在希望縫一雙新鞋一件新布褂好壯觀瞻。有的却無奈地躺下睡覺。她們每人有自己的舖蓋，（這和江南人家主人預備鋪蓋不同。）到夜間便橫七豎八地攤開，每晚花四枚到六枚的夜宿錢，白天自己買點粗食充飢。</p>
<p>「有大脚的麼？」我的街坊用眼晴搜索着。</p>
<p>所主笑了：「那倒沒有呢，近來恰巧出來的全是小脚。」</p>
<p>一個近五十歲的正在洗脚的女傭工搭話了，她正在把一對棕子形的金蓮放在一隻綠盆裏說：「小脚不和大脚一樣麼？別瞧小，事情不少作哪，炒菜拖地板全行。」說着，很氣憤似的。</p>
<p>街坊終于點了一個二十多歲的。這要是沒有南方沒出閣的「大姐」的，卽使是二十歲，也全是出了嫁的，據說是家裏捨不得，一半也許是比較不開通的原故吧。</p>
<p>那所主還在替女傭工掙點工錢，因爲如果成功時，循例第一個月她拿一元錢中的三角，如果工錢是四塊，那女傭工便得送她一元二角，到節下還得給一兩毛。明知她苛，但不能不去找她、而且找也不是容易的，非有鄕親介紹不可，否則不敢担保。</p>
<p>走出來時，看見廂房裏還坐着五六個呢，一個人凑了上來問：</p>
<p>「不送我麽，我去！」</p>
<p>「得挨前後啊！人家指定了。」所主答話。她送到門口時還股般叮囑：</p>
<p>「別另呌了啊，明天一定送。」</p>
<p>「這個人可靠，別上別家去另呌了吧。明早一定送。」她怕我們照雇了別的介紹所。</p>
<p>找飯吃的人是過剩，而靠這剝削的人也更在掙扎。</p>
<p>由城市到鄉村，鄉村到城市，全是處弱，災病，和貧苦，只是勉强的支撑罩住了這些症侯。也許一些打鄕下逃荒出來不久的人會暫時感到安慰，但如果住久了也會迷惘地這樣猜摸：</p>
<p>「哪一天才會找不到一個連勞力也沒處出賣地方呢？」</p>
<h3 id="c244">談私娼聯保法 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>社會不景氣，影響到公娘生意冷淡她們又負不起重捐，就漸流爲私娼。以及各地農村破產，都市工塲貨物，傾銷减少，失業女工頓見增加，卒爲衣食不繼，多迫得秘密賣淫。最近據廣州市之私娼調査統計，爲數達二萬餘人之多。</p>
<p>按公娼和私娼的分別，就是在政府領有營業牌照與否之別。那麽爲私娼的，自然都是爲要避免花捐之負担而已。但當局認爲私娼茂盛，甚傷風化，卽行嚴令査捕懲罰。罰資大約每次三數十元。</p>
<p>她們以私自出局侑酒或接客過夜，其所得三數元必與該店待役四六均分，介紹人旣得四成，本身只佔有六成；而六成之中又須繳納房租，電費，女傭工艮，膳費等。她們出賣了自己的肉體，拿來的錢還要分給別人，結果自己所得，實不過幾角小數，還不够花費在服飾與醫理花柳病症。</p>
<p>因此，她盡想盡了千方萬法，化裝爲女學生之流，徘徊於熱鬧塲所，盡其吊膀子手段，引誘男子入其私窩。至有賣身與人，大受鴇母約束酷待，尙不能自由私勾嫖客，又負不起被拿獲時之罰金者，只得在生存的掙扎之下又想了一個分担痛苦的辦法，就是「聯保方法」——她們集十數人爲一組，如有某同人被査捕時，卽平均凑欵，代爲繳納罰金。</p>
<p>在這裏我們到底發生了疑問：是不是我們可以用高壓的手段——抽捐，就能餘滅絕或减少娼妓底發展和流弊，匡護道德，拯救女子走上正當的軌道？事實上，賣肉生涯並不好過，那一個娼妓不想像人一樣地幸福地生存着？誰不想在社會上護獲得一點正當的職業？可憐的是這些被社會所有的職業部門排除，接棄出來的，（亦有智識淺薄），不能有所別謀的婦女們。無疑的，她們何曾不是和大家一樣的由社會要滾下來的良善份子？現在旣淪爲公娼而轉爲私娼，在私娼的私生活之下，尤維持不得，而設了聯保的方法……來保留和延長各人的生命。如此變幻無窮的顧存這種苦不像人的生活。這個豈是任何壓力可以阻止？更豈是一種形式的廢娼運動所能撲滅的嗎？</p>

<p>— 路爾鈺</p>
<p>男女平權的聲浪雖巳高唱入雲，然而這一二十年來的女權究竟伸張到了什麽地步，這就不是怎麽容易答覆的問題，這次我們的地方報上大閙西施選舉，舉凡湯糰西施，鐵匠西施，香姻西施都在被選之列，選舉「西施」，是不是崇高女權？無論如何我以爲是含有侮辱性質，男入閙女人的玩意兒日新月異，這種變相的侮辱，做女人的一刻不能忍受呵！然而像敝縣的「西施羣」逆來順受，而且「笑逐顏開」，眞令人不解！爲明白「西施羣」的逆來順受，二月十一日午才有訪湯糰西施的舉動！</p>
<p>北門巷口一爿二葷店模樣的湯幗店內生意興隆，滿滿的兩桌人不容你挿足，這兩桌學生模樣的顧客嬉皮笑臉地在糊調。所謂湯糰西施，白凈鵝蛋臉，蓬髮，長長的身材，她很圓到的應酬着，時常笑，少爺們川流不息，來這裏抽一根紙烟弄上兩個湯糰，不比打茶圍經濟得多！男女的心理大槪如此！好容易找到了屋角的位置，同是給我五分鐘的機會。</p>
<p>我開始訪問西施：</p>
<p>「你叫西施，是嗎！久仰！」</p>
<p>「胡閙，報館裏跟我揍上一個什麽西施」，我不懂什麽呵！先生！」她格格的笑了一陣。</p>
<p>「你是很快活的！我知道！」</p>
<p>她驀然綳緊面孔低低說「你曉得！」</p>
<p>「生意好哇！」</p>
<p>「生意是不錯，一天有這麼十多塊錢！」</p>
<p>「生意好，就應該快活，誰也趕不上你們呵！」</p>
<p>「生意好，我就快活？嗯！」</p>
<p>「我每天打從你們前走過，你那一會不是笑嘻嘻的招待人？」</p>
<p>「沒法呵！不這麼着那來飯吃，我願意嗎？」</p>
<p>一塊小手帕輕輕的掩上眼來。</p>
<p>湯糰店裏的小夥計瞪着我，我知道三言兩語找出禍來了，接着門板一響，兩個烏黑頭髮的西裝少年闖入，西施的手被揑得緊緊，她迎着笑臉說。</p>
<p>「隨便坐坐！潘先生！」</p>
<p>「四兩陳紹，湯糰四個，花生米六十文」</p>
<p>我走出門外。</p>
<p>一路想，二萬萬女同胞中類似湯糰西施的很多，爲了生計問題輾轉在痛苦的鞭子」下，女權運動固然抗爭得非常熱烈，而結果只是解放了上中層階級的婦女，湯糰西施還是一輩子解放不到的呵！</p>
<h3 id="c247">花魁的要求 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 伍月</p>
<p>最近翻閱從前剪下來的舊報，覺得有很多的舊事値得重提，這裏就是許多舊事中値得一提的一件小事，今且抄錄如下：</p>
<p>「前淸遺老繼紫綬之棄妾花魁，入濟良所擇配後，希望領娶者頗不乏人。惟因花魁所要之條件中有兩條不能如願，故此未肯遷就。聞此兩條件：（一）須年齡相當，不願作妾。（一）領娶爲妻之良人須尊重其自由權，不得稍有侵犯。凡欲領娶者，聞此條件，咸以爲難事云。</p>
<p>我看了花魁這兩個條件以後，覺得這是很平常約條件，爲什麽領娶者聞此條件咸以爲難事呢？我想，旣然希望領娶者頗不乏人，對於須相當年齡」這一要求大概不會成問題；成問題的顯然是在作妾不作妾和須尊重其自由權不得稍有侵犯這兩件事。</p>
<p>仔細考應一下，這兩個條件是互相矛盾的，討不起小老婆的男人，固然會尊重其自由權而且不會侵犯她，可是道種男人不能養活她；能够有金錢給她揮霍的男人，他即使不把她作妾，至少不會尊重其自由權，而且稍稍總要侵犯她的。所以結果，大家都覺得，這兩個條件是一件難事啦！</p>
<p>其實，花魁的遭遇正指示出一般女人的命運。一般女人，跟從窮漢的女人吵起架來總是因爲他不能養活她，跟從富翁的女人哭訴起來總是因爲他虐待她。</p>
<p>造成這一局面的基本原因，自然，要追朔到當時社會的經濟關係。女子不能自立，女子從屬於男子，這完全是我們這種社會的特徵。</p>
<p>這則舊新聞是已經有十年光景了，現在的女子是已經有了職業了。然而，假使我們把這段舊新聞在報上再刊一遍，人們一定會相信這是一則新近發生的新聞吧？這就是說明，花魁所要求的這兩件很平常的條件，經過十年之後的現在，人們還是認爲一件難事呢！</p>
<p>唉，鬧過迸許多年數的婦女運動，連花魁的要求還未曾允諾，那末，還談得到什麽婦女解放！長此以往，我相信，花魁的要求是沒萌時候被允諾的了，如果社會的經濟關係一直没有變更？</p>

<p>我說，文章的性質有兩種：一種是硬性的，一種是軟性的。所謂硬性文章者，卽關於科學，政治，經濟……等等的理論文章是；所謂軟性文章者，乃是指詩歌，小說，戲劇，生活素描，幽默小品，散文隨筆……等等具有藝術的特性的文章而說的。如果一切文章都是表現着人類的思想與感情的，那麽，硬性文章的特點，便是在於說理論，以理解的力來表現一定的思想與感情；軟性文章則反是，它的特點，不是在於議論，而是在於描寫，是具體地生動地來描寫一定的思想與感情的。好的硬性文章，是從各方面詳細地去說明一種眞理的；善於作這類文章的人，他不僅具有正確的觀念，而且還有非常豐富的論澄，也不空談由象的旣念，也不幾戒也羅列公式，也是以也史的見實的許多實際的列證來說明一個正確的理論的；他不僅有豐富的材料，而且還有系統的科學的方法，他能漸次地很有次序地把他的材料溶化在他的理論中，一點也不混亂：他作起文章來，好像剝笋子一樣，一層一層地剝得非常淸楚，毫無遺漏和混雜的地方，使讀者看起來非常順眼，不致糢糊不懂。所以好的硬性文章雖然較硬，但讀起來也是有興趣的。譬如，因格爾士與普利哈洛夫等的硬性文章，雖然他們的理論很深刻，沒有較高的哲學科學的知識便不容易看得懂，但是，倘若你有了看他們的着作的能力，細心去閱讀他們的著作，那你便會覺得他們說的頭頭是道，處處都是以不容否認的事實和眞理來抓住你的心的。至於那些淺學的愚笨的作硬性文章的人，不是亂七八糟地堆積材料，便是玩弄抽象名詞，或者濫列公式，因此，不管其理論本身是否正確，其作出的文章都是使人越讀越討厭的。與上面所說的好的硬性文章同樣，好的軟性文章乃是非常細微非常具體地從各方面來描爲人類的一種生活的；善於作軟性文章的人，他對於他所要描寫的生活非常理解，他所佈置出的塲面完全是活的塲面，使讀者看着时好像自身也存在於那塲面中似的；他所表現的喜悅，憤怒，悲傷，恐懼的感情都是極眞實的感情，使人看着時也卽刻發生同樣的感情出來……我們看陀思杜以夫斯基的「罪與罰」，當我們的眼睛接觸到其中的主人公去殺人和其殺了人以後的情境時，我們的心裏也要跳動，覺得有點恐懼，但無論怎樣恐懼，還是要熱心地看下去；同樣，當我們看蕭伯納的幽默文章時，自己也要發笑；當我們看到托爾斯泰的「復活」中的最悲痛的一幕時，不禁眼淚也會流了出來，心裏感到極大的悲傷……這是什麽道理呢？我以爲這便是因爲那些偉大的作家善於寫軟性文章，他能　　眞實地藝術地把人間的一種生活形態，思想感情表現出來，使你看時就非發生極大的感動不可。</p>
<p>硬性文章與軟性文章雖然各有其特點，但它們也並非絕對不同的。依我看來，硬性文章中有軟性，軟性文章中也有硬性；硬性文章並非硬如鋼鐵，一點柔和氣也沒有；軟性文章也並不是其軟如棉，一點力量也沒有的。非常顯然，好的硬性文章，不僅是能征服人的思想，而且能感動人的感情；善於寫硬性文章的人，其思想自然是很正確，同時其感情也是非常熱烈的；他寫起文章來，不僅沒有乾燥無味的議論，而且還曾用生動的詞句去描寫他所表現的思想。因此我說「硬」中有「軟」。同樣，好的軟性文章也是在正確的理論支配下寫出來的；一個善於寫軟性文章的人，不僅具有偉大的藝術的表現力，而且是具有前進的世界觀；其在表現某種社會生活時，絕不是無意識的表現，而是在其前進的世界觀支配之下意識地描寫着的。因此我又說「軟」　也有「硬」。</p>
<p>但是，因爲軟性文章戚情成分較多，是形象地生動地表現着社會生活的，其所用詞句也多爲我們在日常生活中所用的用語，所以有起來很順眼睛，不須費多大的思索力就能理解，有些寫硬性文章的人，往往喜歡借着軟性文章的形式來表現其「硬性」的理論者，其原因卽在此。目前中國的一般的文化水平當然很低，較高的「硬性」的理論不易爲初學的讀者所理解，所以有些寫硬性文章的人便常在一般讀者的日常生活中去找問題，借着軟性文章的形式（如戲劇小說或講故事的形式）來表現其硬性的理論。如「新生」的「街頭講話」，新出各雜誌</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的硬性文章「軟寫」的各種學術講座等，皆可說是由此產生的、這個硬性文章「軟寫」的辦法當然很好，但要想把這類文章寫得好却不容易、因為這不僅要有正確的理論，對於一般讀者的生活要有涳刻的理解，而且還要有相當的描寫才能；但「硬」慣了的寫硬性文章的人，要馬上完全具備這些知能，把自己的文章相當地「軟」下來，却是很難辦到的所以我奉勸一般寫硬性文章的人，如果自己有「軟」的才能，那當然可將其硬性文章「軟寫」，以增加其對社會的作用，倘使沒有這種才能，那就希望慢慢去學習，不要忙着就將那低下的硬性文章軟寫的東西發表出來，去擾亂一般讀者的眼睛。眞的，沒有將硬性文章「軟寫」的才能的人，如果一定要「硬」着頭皮去「軟」幹，那其所寫成的東西一定是「硬」旣不「硬」，「軟」也不「軟」，什麽都不像的。最近我就看到許多以軟性文章的形式來講自然科學的「硬」理論的文章，不僅是並無軟性文章的趣味，而且因爲作者拼命在形式上去講求（形式當然也未講求好）（而使內容空虛，終於使其文章成爲男不男，女不女的，不像個東西了　像這樣的將硬性文章「軟寫」的文章，我以爲並不比好的原本的硬性文章高强。於此我說：能做什麽的，還是去做什麽吧，不要去做自己不能幹的事情來出醜啊！</p>

<h3 id="c249">鐵路英雄們 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 陳數旬</p>
<p>一切在平漢鐵路上找油水的傢伙——游民，痞子，散兵，都呌荒騎遊勇。這是鐵路人員給他們取的渾名，牠的歷史也許同鐵路的壽命一樣古老。</p>
<p>這一些傢伙，說不定是農人的兒子，亦工友的兄弟，總之，他們是沒有了土地，沒有了工作，爲了生活的進攻，學會了偸鷄摸狗的勾當。又因爲鐵路給與他們偷竊的機會，於是就到這兒來找油水了。</p>
<p>很明顯的，他們不是員工，也非旅客，但每天都在車裏鑽進鎭出，站上跑來跑去。鑽，跑幹嗎？自然是販運私貨竊取行李，偸煤炭，騙鄕老。總之是幹着一切不規則的把戲！</p>
<p>北方的海洛英（白麵），仗他們運到漢口，南方的姻土，也仗他們運到北京。他們是癮君子的救命恩主，人間罪惡的推銷員（製造罪惡另有其人），但自己不明白對社會的利害，祗知道能够獲到油水，什末也願幹！</p>
<p>所謂私貨，不單是毒品，凡是能够賺錢而又逃脫關稅的買賣都包括在內。譬如磁州（在河南河北兩省間，曹操七十二塚在這兒）出梨棗，販到漢口賺錢兩倍，回頭帶銅子到北平，可得十分之四的摩利，來往不放空，有的是油水。</p>
<p>不過做這買賣，最少要具備：一，資本，二，聲望。沒本錢做什末生意？沒活動能力豈敢冒險運私？普通的游民，痞子不敢而且也不能來這一套，所以幹這買賣的，大都另有背景，或歸荒騎遊勇中的老英雄直接經理。至於初出茅廬的窮傢伙，則各依自己的本領，找尋吃飯的路徑，年齡小的半節子，祇好偸煤炭。可是他們人雖小，本事可不尋常，媒車離站二三里，便一躍跳進車廂，上面抬起煤塊向下用，下面有人往別處搬，迨車進揚旗（離站半里左右），他們已工作完畢，溜過對面的荒地了。每列媒車停站，最少有幾噸煤的損失。沿途雖有警兵押護，也難照顧周到。煤偷的先决條件，便是學會抓車，無論速度快慢、都要上下自如（自然也有殉難的），使押車的就是趕去也抓他不住、要想開槍，又覺事體太小。其實媒炭是他們的生命，縱然槍刀架頸、也要奪回生命的。而且他們的服裝與媒灰混合，恰成天然約保護色，如果是在朦　的夜間，便誰也分辨不出他是人還是煤炭！</p>
<p>竊取行李的，大都是筋强力壯的少年英雄，不但抓車的本領高强，而且偸竊的技巧件件皆能，因爲一年三百六十天，天天都在練習這項技術。他們能够巧妙的化裝，混在旅客中，要偸軍人，目己便扮裝一個軍官，總之，隨着買賣的不同，他們的裝束也得隨時改變，給他們竊取的，自然以小東西爲多，（如皮包，禮帽，小箱，）但有時連被蓋捲，大皮箱，也給他們盜走，往往大功吿成，失主還不知覺，縱然發覺很早也奈何他不得，因爲他可以跳下火車。做　生意，大致都是幾個人在一道：有人巡風，有人動手，有人擋住失主，一切都安徘的很好，失風的事很少見的。不過在快車的頭二等裏，比較要費點力，這兒有憲兵，警察，而且客人較少，不易藏躱。假若在慢車那就很隨便，這兒沒有高貴的旅客，也沒有憲警保護，祇要看中某項東西，十有九分可以到收。——假如乘慢車由漢口出來，人的擁擠，眞使你閉氣，其中有大部分都是來找油水的。祗要過了横店，人數就覺减少，但這時最少可以聽見幾個人在嚷鬧，說是丢掉東西。火車的頭一小站，平素很少査票，因此想找油水的也特別多。到了站口，不管達到目的與否，大都跳下車去等對面車來，以便找回頭生意。</p>
<p>還有一種跑荒車的散兵，因爲自己有一套破軍服或舊符號，乘坐慢車，煤車，是很自由的，於是常常奔走於平漢道上，一則幹那偸鷄摸狗的勾當，同時還可斯騙老百姓。斯騙的方法，不外：一，假裝招募委員：三五個人梭巡在街頭巷尾，扯起招兵紙旗幌來幌去，見着年靑小子就吹：那兒地方繁華，那個部隊待遇很好——三餐大米飯，十幾元大洋的薪餉，說的天花亂墜，口角油流；於是勾引了學徒，勾引了農人的兒子。等到報了名，又故意宣傳給家長知道，假如家長不願意兒子當太兵，便要化錢贖取。否則投軍人的衣服和銀錢，也要給「招募員」騙走。二，携帶旅客：鄕壩佬總是愛錢，想出門很吝惜車費，散兵訪得這消息，於是自吿奮勇願帶某人前去，祗要幾毛茶錢，一切都可保險。鄉壩佬貪圖便宜，又知道兵大爺有這本領，於是東摸西摸摸出幾毛錢，縮脚縮收的跟兵大爺上了車。可是不久兵大爺溜走不見了。自己又得摸錢補票——也許被趕下車。</p>
<p>我們到了黄河北岸，假如注意一下，每個大站（新鄕，彰德，順德，保定等）都可見着手搖紙旗的招募委員，這就是欺騙老百姓的散兵。同時每一部慢車，煤車，都裝滿了灰色動物，這當中最少有大半是荒騎遊勇。這些傢伙幹嗎愛在黄河北岸活動？據我的推想，也許由於北方的窮小子羨慕南邊的大米飯！</p>
<p>整個平漢路，都給荒騎遊勇做了活動的地盤。不過因為地域環境不同，也產生各種角色；北方製造海洛英，毒販也特別多。彰德產煤，偷煤的小子可以編成隊伍。致於李鬼之流的剪徑客，則首推漢口至信陽州最多，就中要算廣水與武勝關之間，為英雄用武之地。他們不單劫奪行李，有時還送你回老家：我在這一段地帶，曾經遇着兩次甩人下軌這。據同車人說：頭一回是復仇，第二次乃因失主反抗‘當時我眞有戒心，覺得行路之難，勝過上靑天！這些傢伙愛在這兒生事，無非因爲山嶺較多，便於逃匿，並不是像別人所謂：湖北佬原不規矩！</p>
<p>鐵路英雄們，在表面看來，自然是各顯神通，無人管束，其實內裏却有　密的組織，各有活動的範圍　，煤偸不能刧行李、黄河北岸的荒騎，不能越過南岸截奪財喜（也有勾通的時候）。每個組織均有嚴格的紀律，有最高的領袖（頭子）；小傢伙在外面衝錄陷陣，所得的財喜，一古腦兒交給頭子，由他自由分配。不過頭子雖然坐地分金銀，可是平時也得養活小傢伙，同時若惹出什末禍事，也要十分的担承。情形和哥老會的差不多。</p>
<p>「頭子」這尊銜和地位，全憑鬥爭得來的，在荒騎遊勇的歷史上，不知記下了多少汗馬功勞，而今平漢路上的潑皮，無賴，能有生活的地盤，都是頭子們掙下的基業。他稱孤道寡統領羣衆，也是千該萬該，要知堂堂的交通機關，居然給他們打進打出，誰說頭子沒有功勞，沒有本領呢？</p>
<p>如果掙下一名「荒騎既子」，等於揭揚嶺上的張横，李俊，可以稱覇一方；誰敢喊他一聲游民，痞子？誰敢說他壞蛋？假如他要抖一下威風，馬上可以號召幾百個弟兄，也許交通機關，要給他搗亂不堪呢！</p>

<h3 id="c250">淮北酒業 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 樹旬</p>
<p>淮北的酒業，不但甲於工蘇一省，就同全國產酒區比較，也不會敗下風頭！</p>
<p>那兒農村的主要產品，便是高粱，小麥，這兩項東西都是酒的原料；釀酒的槽坊不必取之於遠的市塲。同時許多槽坊老板，大都是擁有麥田的地主，以自己的原料供自己釀酒，可以省减許多麻煩，（縱然還需要購買，也由附近市塲供給。）並且與其出售高粱小麥，不如把牠變成酒獲利來得原。有了這種種原因，酒業就在淮北普遍起來了。</p>
<p>我們如果巡視淮北一週，在東海，灌雲，贛楡，漣水，沐陽的鄉村，城　，都可發現很多槽坊，總之整個淮北都是酒業分佈地帶。——在這兒我們可知酒業與農村經濟的重大關係，也可說槽坊便是淮北農村經濟的代表，由牠的榮枯，卽測量得出農村的眞實情形了。</p>
<p>槽坊有大小不同，所出的酒也分兩類；（卽當地人所稱的大酒，小酒）大槽坊所釀者爲「高粱」，（酒名如此，原料乃高粱小麥兩種　雜。）小槽坊祇能出產「土燒仿紹」，（、小槽坊又名「小鍋甑」，土紹又名「土黄」。）二者不但名色有別，卽價植，銷路，亦相差很遠。不過我祇簡單的提明：大酒可以行銷遠地，每担（磅秤一百斤）約二十餘元，小酒祇在當地零售，每祖最高價値八元。還須說明的，大槽坊乃是完全的商業組織，小槽坊祗當農家的副業，釀酒或閉歇，均沒一定的計劃。</p>
<p>就產酒區比較，東海，贛褕，產量較多？沭陽的酒味最好，因此價値方面無論在當地或遠處沭酒都要昻責，（沭酒一担二十七八元，其他的祇賣二十二三元。）不過那要看購買者是否行家，因爲運往遠處的酒同是頂的「淮酒」招牌。酒質的優劣自然以水質為轉移，含鹽分較少的水所釀的酒是味便好，否則反是。要知淮北的飲料，普通都是鹹約，想喝一杯「淡水」茶，眞比窮人吃咖啡還難！</p>
<p>淮酒的主要市塲首推上海，其次是南京鈸江。當其繁盛的的時候，單走上海的酒，平均每月總在千担左右，而價値也抬的很高。糟坊的老板，大都吃得肥肥胖胖，荷包也裝得很滿、這麼一來引起投機家的眼紅，許多土豪劣紳都搖身一變而爲酒商了。那時單說贛楡一縣，足有八十餘家大糟坊，如果統計整個淮北，眞是一串大的數字。、</p>
<p>可是花好不常，月圓難再，繁榮的景况已成了往事的追憶；在這全國木景氣的籠罩下，酒業也難逃惡劣的命運：銷路閉塞，價格低落。過去專走上海的酒，改道附近各縣亂</p>

<h3 id="c251">愛因斯坦傳（續完） <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>在德國，一九一九年十一月「柏林畫報」刊載了愛氏的肯像，柏林由才此人知道了這樣偉大的學者是和自己同住在一個都市中；以後在德國各地都傳着愛氏的大名；甚至有些人把其新生的孩子也名爲亞爾巴特，一時之間，愛因期坦及其相對性原理，簡直成爲了世間的流行兒。然而，同時在另一方面，由於愛氏是猶太種而引起的反感也日益高揚了起來。</p>
<p>一九二一年，愛氏應請在巴黎講演，這是大戰後法國聘請德國知識階級的第一次。但當時法德仇恨甚深，在巴黎市街上講德國話者都有危險，所以聘請愛氏的主持者特向人說明他是瑞士人，不是德國人。在當時德國的學界中愛氏當然是初出的新人，對他的學說懷疑的人也不少，但聽了他的講演之後，大家都敬佩他了。數學者力學者潘爾費也是其中之一人。</p>
<p>以後不久，愛氏又被請到倫敦講演。當其登台演講時，荷爾登卿向衆介紹道：此人是二十世紀的牛頓，甚至較牛頓還要偉大的喚起思想上之革命的一人。據說因爲他是猶太種德國人，起初並未有人拍手歡迎，經過荷爾登卿的老練的介紹之後，聽衆才注意到了這個新發見的重要性，覺悟到了學問藝術是沒有國境的。於是愛氏才受到了歡迎。此後他更到美國各地講演派行，當然都是很受歡迎的，據說有一次他在某都市中講演時，聽衆有五六千人之多。</p>
<p>一九二二年愛氏曾應日本「改造社」之請赴日，也備受歡迎。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>大戰爆發後，愛因斯坦因爲是瑞士國籍，與什麼總動員等無關係。同時，在戰爭的時候，德國九十三名大學敎授述名發出的有名的宣言，他也沒有參加。這時候，不管周圍的空氣是如何地緊張。他還是努力他的研究，完成了一般相對性理論。其態度，正如拿破倫戰爭時代的黑格爾樣。但是，戰時的德意志國家主義者非常反對猶太人，及至德國戰敗以後，這種反猶太人的形勢尤其激烈。他們以爲當時俄德的革命，歐洲的不安，都是猶太民族之陰謀的結果。愛因斯坦是猶太種，當然是被反對的一個對象。他的被稱爲科學革命的相對性原理，在當時也被那些反猶太的人們認爲是猶太人顚覆世界的陰謀之一，而加以攻擊了。</p>
<p>大戰以後，在德國排斥猶太人正熾熱的時候，在一九一九年的某一天，柏林的猶太人知識份子在一個餐館裏集會，討論關於猶太人的將來問題。愛因斯坦本來是離開了猶太人恊會的束縛的，但他出席這個會議，靜聽了那些猶太人的言論後，却發生了把猶太民族從現實的苦惱中救出來的想念。這並不是因爲他自己也是猶太人，完全出於利己的心理，也不是由於一時的感情衝動，更不是因爲他具有什麽猶太的意德屋羅基而發生這種想念的，不，他之所以如此者，乃是因爲猶太人受了殘酷的虐待，他是站在人道主義的立塲，想把他們從虐待中救濟出來。從此以後，在猶太人問題上，愛因斯坦便貢獻了他的很大的力量。</p>
<p>及至一九三三年時，德國政局發生變化，愛氏又大受當局的腰迫，便於這年九月離開比利時的旅居而往英國，十月　行渡美，現在還在繼續其偉大的硏究，並利用其餘暇的時問在美法等國的大學裏講學。（完）</p>
<p>碰，等於給人趕慌了的流寇祇好抄小路逃命，繁盛時代每担最少二十五六元（沭酒三十餘元），隨後减到二十元，好像失掉了靑春的婦人，情塲中逐漸减色了！在這種情况下，資本大的老招牌還可維持，否則便是虧本得呌苦連天！</p>
<p>於是他們極力的掙扎着，想出許多法術預備逃出眼前的大難。所謂「法術」，不外節省開支，（取締學徒，裁减工人，）减低成本：他們在運銷遠處的高梁中，儘量混雜土黄，每一祖裏面，最少有七成小酒，表面還充大酒的牌子，這麽一來，市價雖低，而成本就少了。同時他們的土黄並不是在小糟坊批發，自己隨着環境的需要也附設小鍋甑，—牠的作用自然是造出土黄，專門冲淡大酒。</p>
<p>但是這效用也不過等於安眠藥水，久之還是一種自殺政策，一方面批發者祇能被騙一次，同時「大限臨頭」，無論再掙扎也祇是迴光反照罷了！近來的情况更轉險惡：運到上海的酒减賣十七八元還沒有顧主，有許多糟坊的「跑賬」（酒的推銷員）滯留上海半年，還眼睜睜的對着存貨嘆息！至於抄小路的流寇生意也常有原缸原簍向後轉的笑話。遠處的銷路旣已閉塞，可是有許多從未出過門的酒，偏偏在這風勢不佳的當兒運到上海南京，這並非學時髦，實在是不得已的矛盾呵！要知糟坊不釀酒，過了相當時間窖口就要變壞，酒若裝缸也要逐漸損失分量，而且爲了取出本錢，不得不急於發售；但是本地的銷路有限，兼之各糟坊間又競爭甚烈，如此不得已而運往別處胃險一試！</p>
<p>在去年，整個淮北的糟坊，幾乎走到最後的命運；一年中約有五十家大糟坊宣吿歇業，至於小糟甑可說是已全體倒閉，就中要算贛楡損失最大；因爲劉黑七（劉桂堂）的匪軍，曾刦掠縣城一次，擾亂鄉村竟達數月（如接鄰山東之沙河等處），在那掠奪擾攘中，酒的銷路旣被阻隔，本錢亦給其提取，在那馬隊的踐踏下，酒缸窖口也要破壞無餘呢！</p>
<p>總之，淮北的酒業，已由繁榮降爲蕭條，枯萎，凋敝了！我曾經見着大糟坊减少窖口（窖口愈多，表現生意愈發達），也見着他們拆鍋爐，賣牲口，直到「關門大吉」！</p>
<p>酒業的凋敝不單是糟坊老板的惡運，而且還影響到淮北整個農村呵！（自然由於農村的破產而影響到酒業。）上面已經說過，淮北主要出產是高粱小麥，兩者都是酒的原料，在酒業興盛時代，兩者的銷路糟坊要佔四分之二，現在糟坊倒閉的很多，最少减去一成銷路。在過去，小麥還可推銷到上海南京，可是受了美麥的抵制，不但市價低落，竟至不能出口。（美麥更佔據准北市塲！）在這情况下，擁有麥田的地主，也弄得焦頭爛額了！</p>
<p>還有：糟坊在淮北的鄕村，等於一個農村錢莊，在別處販回現金，收買本地的原料，又把現金放散出來，對於淮北農村最少盡有調節金融的作用。同時酒業發達，糟坊需要勞働力也多，使一部份鄕村失業者得有噉飯的地方。可是現在糟坊逐漸倒閉下來，農村經濟異常枯窘，失業集團更增加了許多生力軍。如此，淮北酒業的衰頽，給與農村的影響是多麼的嚴重呵！</p>

<p>在世界經濟危機緊迫的當前，無論中外人士都在竭力探求復興或繁榮的出路。美國是世界上最富足的國家；同時，也是世界經濟危機最深入化的主要部分。人們欲圖復興或繁榮之道，雖然未必卽以美國爲可仿效，可是，回溯美國資本主義在當年以突飛猛進的姿勢稱雄於世界的歷史情形，這對於我們的認識和研究，恐怕不無小補的吧！</p>

<p>全世界的百分之七十五；烟草爲百分之三十八；小麥爲百分之十七；棉花爲半數以上。這樣，其農業的發達不僅充分利用了地理的優越條件，而且也充分地促進和輔佐了工業的生產。</p>
<p>美國經濟在如此壯盜的進步中，據一九二七年的統計，牠的財富竟在三千萬萬法郞以上，約佔全世界財富的百分之四十。牠的現金，當時在各銀行所保存的總數，爲全世界所有現金的　數。因此，美國對於世界各國，成爲高利貸的債權人。牠不僅有佔着世界各國輸出第一位的資格；在金融資本的對外投資方面，它更是首要的獨佔「超額利潤」者</p>
<p>美國在經濟發展的過程中，比較英法諸國資本主義，總算是短期內成長起來的。這種以迅速發展致富的原因，當然要從美國社會史與地理條件的特殊性上得到科學的說明。</p>
<p>美國經濟發展史上第一個特點，是沒有封建制度障碍資本主義。我們曉得歐洲白人移到美國去的時候，除了南部地方　以對建的方式分割土地成功之外　　北部　　　　　了的。因為部　　方氏從前是奴隸制度，歐州白人去把封建制度放在南部，土人易於接受。可是，美國北部有廣大的面積都是自由土地。這種自由土地對於後來美國資本主義的發展具有决定的意義。</p>
<p>歐洲人最初僅移民到美國北部的大西洋沿岸。（這是現今人口最稠密的地方。）由這種地方向西部發展，是從十八世紀七十年代開始的。當時的中央政府及各邦政府，規定了極低廉的價格販賣土地與人民。差不多有一世紀之久，人民無須出多大的代價卽可取得土地。這是政府鼓勵人民迅速西移的政策。在一八六〇年間，密士失必（Mississippi）河以西地方，僅有全人口的七分之一。但在一九一〇年間，這裏的人口數目竟爲全國的三分之一了。在十九世紀的後半期間，美國（除了南部）農業沒有租借土地缺乏的痛　。這樣的情形，使農民獲得了充分發達的助力，而且也加速了資本的蓄積。當時農民，就是土地的自由所有者，同時也是企業家。因爲土地所有者能够充分利用地面上的資源，對於工業便可供給價格低廉的原料，而且工業中心地帶的勞動者可以獲得價格低廉的食品，特別是農業自身的資本蓄積發達的結果，能使勃興的工業品暢銷於國　内市塲。所以，美國的資本主義，在一開始便是農業與工業自由並進。這種人力與自然力能够協調於產業之發展的簡單理由，就是美國社會史上沒有封建制度阻碍其資本主義發展的緣故。</p>
<p>還有一件事情是我們不能疏忽的：這就是美國資本主義發展的向上時期內，沒有帝國主義的更大的資本主義去壟斷它。倒是恰恰相反的，在歐洲已經發展起來的英法資本主義，作了美國經濟的極好參考。這，無論對於美國資本主義的經營與技術方面都是有意義的。</p>
<p>至於從生產力的特質上研究，美國資本家所給的工資，比歐洲的要高一些。因爲勞動者旣然易於獲得土地謀生活，所以他們去充當工錢勞動者的時候，資本家自然要拿出較高額的工資方能得到僱傭。由於這樣的關係，美國資本家在採用機械及使勞動者工作的生產性上，不能不設法加緊其生產效率。這可以說是美國資本家不能不以大力注意生產技術之改良的理由。難怪有許多大資本家或企業家都花了莫大的費用，努力組織科學研究所或實騐室，促進了許多技術家及勞動者的各種新發明。關於這層，在美國經濟之發展上，是極有意義的</p>
<p>此外還有美國農業之機械化，海陸交通之發展，其直接的影響，也是反轉去促進生產手段之製造的。這樣的生產手段之進步，幾乎使美國經濟體系完全分工化和秩序化。這也是美國經濟發展的主要條件。</p>
<p>美國經濟順利地向前發展着的情形，旣如上述，所以，在它一帆風順的近歡十年間，國内是很少暴亂或戰爭的浪費的。譬如以軍隊的人數一項而論，美國現有陸軍不過十一萬人的樣子，還沒有中國四川省一省軍隊人數的三分之一那樣多。這是因爲美國民主政治秩序足以維持其經濟制度的自然結果。這種政治軍事上的特點，在過去的數十年間，對於美國經濟之發展，具有很大的意義。可是，自近幾年美國經濟恐慌的危機普遍化於國內外以來，由於維持暴亂，罷工及準備國際戰爭所消耗的海，陸，空軍費，確已超出於世界各國之上了。</p>

<h3 id="c260">文學底表現方法 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 天真</p>
<p>文學之所以被稱爲「間接藝術」，是基因於它的表現工具—文字祇習慣地代表某一種觀念，讀者們接受這形象的地反映喚出腦海中固有的觀念而使這兩種觀念混化後才能接觸文學作物詔示的眞實境界。同時我們因戟刺而暴生的靈感，稍縱卽逝，要想用呆滯的文字翻印在生滅祇一剎那頃的靈戚的全貌，縱有純熟的手技，也祇是幾分之幾了。因此文學的表現法，在一個作家—尤其是新踏進文學領域上的人，也是重要凖備工作之一。</p>
<p>我們不否認近年來中國文學踏上了新的路向，無論在題材上和風格上：但除開故意用文字裝飾枯骨淆惑讀者視覺外，較有生命的作品，都顯露着表現力的貧弱，因着論文式的叙述故事，遂使應有的呼應力减少了效果，這在作者，是一個重大的損失吧。</p>
<p>福勞貝爾這樣說過：「不論我們要表現什麽事物，祇有唯一的名詞；要描寫它的運動，祇有唯一的動詞：要課予它的性質，祇有唯一的形容詞。我們應當耐心地去發掘，直到接取唯一的名詞，動詞與形容詞而後已。如果單是發見了類似這些名詞動詞和形容詞，决不能認爲滿足，尤其不能憚於搜求的艱辛而簡便地潦草塞責。」作爲文藝批評史上「單語法」（Siugke　Word　Theory）的福氏的名言；在今日我們認爲創作者從事創作活動時尙應該實踐的。因爲由現實主義出發而刻畫典型的人物性格時，人物的個性的深化和擴大的程度，全恃表現法的傳達，尤其是現階段的從都會的小市民層破落下來的智識分子的兩種矛盾性格，如果在筆下帶有畸輕畸重的誇張的遊戲，那將成了非驢非馬的東西。在作品上，作家應注意的尙有情調部分。音樂之有高亢柔和，繪畫之有明暗，文學之由它的内容的决定，也應有淸脆或憂鬱的調子。</p>
<p>偉大的寫實主義者杜思退夫斯基，構成他的作品的特色是混沌的力學性。他描寫生活在都會的地下室的人們的談話，是急促的斷句，話與話緊迫地重奏着，病態和黯雲籠罩了都會的下層。他寫街燈「如葬儀的明燭散着陰鬱」，寫時鐘「如緊握的咽喉放出尖聲」，寫小屋「如猪棚箱櫃一般」，寫風「如垃圾上乞食的五月蠅嗡嗡地鳴呌着」。這種調子，是何等適切地攝取了文明的大都會的另一面情景！要聯想地象徵底地助長主題的嚴肅性和鼓動力，必需有唯一的詞彙紀錄大都會的騷音的調子，這在杜思退夫斯基的作品上是値得我們學習的。高爾基說得好：「文學的技術，最主要的是語言（卽文字）的研究。語言是作物的基本材料，特別是小說這一部門。它（小說）卽是用法蘭西語或俄羅斯語寫成的「美的語言」。「美」是—音響，色調，言語和故事，通過作家之手的創造的力底人間之感情與智性的產物。卽是作家運用藝術的手腕賦與內容與形式的諧和，用驚異的誇張喚起人們的共戚，我們才稱之爲「美」。」又說：「力學的語言的眞的美，爲情調，性格，以及形成作物的思想的語語正確，明晰和由這影響創製出來的。文學者—「藝術家」應有從豐富的誥彙的全寳庫中和廣博的知識中揀取正確而明瞭的有力的語言的能力。卽在章句之間，用正確的語言—在語言所代表的意味上—來配列，調和地補綴，使作者的思想形象化，並鮮明其情景，使讀者在作者的靈活的筆觸下發見所表現的人間底生動的姿態來。……並且—世界是從鬥爭的動態中發展。文學家對於言語應有仔細的研究，卽須有揀取簡潔，洗鍊，適切，鮮明，優美的語言的才能，纔能使作品收到高度的效果。…」</p>

<h3 id="c261">英國的「好萊塢」歐斯德里的概況 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>好萊塢—這個名字似乎於我們太熟悉了。不用說，它是二十多年以來，世界所承認的事實上的「影都」。但是現在英國的影戲事業，也不甘落後、也自己樹立了一個「影都」，和好萊塢分庭抗　起來。這個英國的影者，就是歐斯德里（Elstree）。</p>
<p>好萊塢（Hollywood）—亦有譯作霍萊塢的—是因為那個地方荊榛未斬的時候，遍地生的都是一種小樹。它的植物學上的名字，叫做「鳥不宿」，因為它的枝葉多角多刺，飛鳥不能棲宿的緣故。這種小樹，英文叫Holly，因此那個地方，就稱為「烏不宿的林」了。歐斯德里一這還是初次的譯名—不知原意是什麼。大概從「德里」上面顧名思義，從前亦是個樹木業生之地吧。</p>
<p>歐斯德里是倫敦郊外一個地方，卻和好萊塢同樣的，具有一種假借附會的意味。我們平常說慣了好萊塢—好萊塢就是美國電影界的全體，影業的集合名詞，殊不知美國最大的米高梅公司却不在好萊塢，而在與好萊塢毘連的卡而佛城（Culver　City）。歐斯德里亦是相仿的。它在普通的說法上，雖是英國的影片公司三大集團的匯聚之所，但是英國的大公司如高蒙英國公司，却在鄰近的「牧林」（Shepherd's　Bush）也。</p>
<p>說明了以上的一點，我們可以不必再提，儘管照舊將歐斯德里當作英國影業的代名詞，如同我們慣用好萊塢三個字，來代表美國影業的全部一樣。不過歐斯德里和好萊塢，却又有一個根本不同之點。好萊塢是一個電影從業員的殖民地，那裏一切與影片製作有關的人物，製片家，導演，演員，臨時演員，技術人員，茶房，聽差等等，生於斯，息於斯，工作於斯。但是歐斯德里不過是一個工場。他們日中去工作了，晚上各自散開，回到倫敦的各處，混在普通的社會之中，看戲，跳舞，或家居靜坐。有人說，就因為這個分別，歐斯德里將來決不至於像好萊塢那樣充滿着風流放誕的新聞了。</p>
<p>歐斯德里和好萊塢相距，有五千五百哩。但是在好萊塢所用的術語，符號，手勢等等，同樣的可以在歐斯德里攝影場看到聽到。什麼靜默哩，燈光哩，卡脫哩，兩地同樣地喧嘩着。在歐斯德里，可以看見同樣的佈景骨子，堆置如山的放着：上海的賭窟哩「注意」；迭更司時代的軍房哩；巴黎的一角哩；到處都可以看見。所以，除去了倫敦的烟霧，是歐斯德里所獨具者之外，其餘的可以說是沒有什麼差別。</p>
<p>因此。好萊塢的演員，如果跑到歐斯德里，給他們同等的豐富薪水，他們一定，是覺得和在家一樣的。在已往的過去，二十餘年好萊塢的極盛朝代，英國及歐洲的電影明星，凡是想賺大薪水，博得大聲譽的，一定先要受到好萊塢的洗禮。歐洲大明星的一半，差不多却被好萊塢吸收了去。但是現在，好萊塢非但將外籍的明星釋放了，讓他們自動跑到倫敦去，並且還有許多美國的明星，要跑到歐斯德里去拍戲。</p>
<p>當然，在美國人方面，不得不冠冕堂皇地說：「從前我們借用他們明星的一半，現在我們亦借了許多位明星給他們。英美兩國本來是同種同文的兄弟之邦，有這許多明星的相互交換，兩國的邦交必定因為藝術上的互助和提携而益加密切了」。須知以上的話，那是外交上的術語。明星們的來來往往，並不是像大學教授或講席，可以由兩國關繫方面設法交換的。金錢，金錢，金錢是他們流轉的原動力。英美兩國並不是互相提携，而是互相爭競，想操縱這一大企業的霸權，想爭得世界的影片市場。</p>
<p>誰能聚集大量的金錢，誰就能吸引大明星，以及技術人才，導演，著作家等。在這種商品藝術的戰爭上，我們返願本國，那一樣及得到人家的萬一。人為砧斧，我為魚肉，怎能不令人心灰意懶呢？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c262">評「堅苦的奮鬬」 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>—卡爾登—</p>
<p>雖然一般的說來，中國電影在進步着，可是個別的作品仍然表示着十分落後。近如「堅苦的奮　」，就是一部失敗的出品。</p>
<p>衹就技術來說，這裏的故事是聯接不起來的。是故事的交代，這對於要求看片子的情節觀眾，在某種程度之下，是可以滿足的，但是「堅苦的奮　」，却連故事的直敘，也沒有做到。最顯然的說明書上有「畢業的一天，朱先生…對學生講演，…不要『承認』東北四省是失地，…」等等，在銀幕上却沒有，以致開頭楊國光所說的朱先生如何如何，簡直使觀眾摸不着頭腦。（至於東北四省，雖不「承認」也是「失地」的問題是在怎樣的訴諸民族戰爭以謀收復失地。）他如大學教師在講「權利」與「義務」的法學的時候，那樣的鏡頭的呆笨，講上二三分鍾，也是說明故事只在乎生硬的說教，完全失去了電影的藝術價值。沒有明顯的聯繫，粗糙與無組織，是劇本最大的毛病。至於進而說到內容如何，更非三言兩語所能說盡了。</p>
<p>一點也不誇大的說，這裏的導演或演技，都顯庸俗與幼稚。以前有過「似水流年」的作者是，想不到會退步到如此地步。這裏衹有笨拙的說教，決不是電影藝術的表現。至於在營業上，也將給與製片者很好的事實教訓了。</p>
<h3 id="c263">「戰地離魂」雜談 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>「戰地離魂」（The　Man　Who　Reclaimed　His　Head），這又是一部富有時代嚴重性的非戰影片。</p>
<p>戰爭的負担，戰爭的罪惡，戰爭的虛偽與欺騙，戰爭的恐怖，以及藉戰爭而作惡的人們的罪孽，這些都赤裸裸地在「戰地離魂」中暴露了出來。</p>

<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>美國廿世紀公司出品　龍納考爾門　洛麗妲楊等主演</p>
<p>勞伯特克萊夫是個瘋人——至少那時的不列顛東印度貿易公司的許多同事的辦事員，是都相信的。克萊夫生性剛愎自用。他厭惡一般商人排場的闊綽。他厭惡辦事員的機械生活，每天在大賬簿裏登記着無窮無盡的數目字。他不服從上司的命令。他以一個辦事員的身份，而僱用了　個掮傘的人。印度白畫之中，烈日當空，熱不可當，但是既為辦事員，就不應當怕熱。克萊夫的不知自量，使潘勃頓大為震怒。尤其使人覺得他是瘋人的，他竟公然指斥莊斯東門牌有弊。莊斯東同在一個公司服務，但地位比他高些。莊斯東要和他決鬥。克萊夫答應了。但是到了兩雄相見的時候，克萊夫衹朝上放空槍。莊斯東眼看着那小夥子的氣燄逼人，未免覺得氣憤　胸，但是却舉不起槍來。</p>
<p>他却不甘示弱，故意恫嚇道：「你還敢說我欺嗎？」克萊夫應聲答道：「我還是說你欺騙！你有本事放槍」！莊斯東却始終舉不起槍來。過了一回，他羞慚滿面，將槍往地上一擲，走了開來，口中恨恨地道：「這人瘋了！」這人瘋了，這次大家又相信了，除去文德蒙麥斯格林之外。麥斯格林之對於克萊夫，是始終如一，深信不疑的。</p>
<p>印度在十八世紀的中業，寶藏物產的富庶，是帝國主義者貪心所夢想不到的。遍地的金銀，稀有的香料，無價的珍寶，使荷蘭，葡萄牙，英，法等國的亡命少年，都願意遠涉重洋，歷盡千辛萬苦，來到酷熱終年，瘴厲遍地的熱帶。所為的都是想掠得一些珍寶錢財，綑載而歸，一生不愁吃着了。但是人種國籍既如此龐雜，於是就互相驚恨殘殺起來。每一個人都藏身於別一人的身後，想得了機會去搯他的喉嚨，置之於死地，好攫得更多的財寶。他們尤其喜歡和當地的部落勾結了，借刀殺人，驅逐另一國籍的人，好使自己享受貿易！簡捷是刦掠—的專利。於是白種人在印度的，因為國籍的不同，就自在殘殺起來。</p>
<p>一天一天的，長行的駝馬隊馱着形形式式的珍寶，運到通商碼頭去。一天一天的，商船載滿了珍寶，橫渡重洋，運到歐洲去。這財源的外流，歷盡多年而不竭絀。各國駐在的官吏，大腹賈，陸續地都已綑載而歸，而團團作富家翁了。但是公司里的辦事員，地位卑微，却除了有限的工資以外，意外之財好似永遠無份的了。不過無份儘管無份，誰不是懷着奢望而來的。勞伯特克萊夫亦就是其中的一份子。</p>
<p>克萊夫來到印度，過着無味的記賬生涯，不覺侷促不安起來。他對着麥斯格林憤然道：「要是早知道這種生活的一無所有，還不如自殺了乾淨些！」艾德蒙安慰他道：「你且安靜些。不要鬧吧。再鬧下去，弄得我們大家却沒有安身之處了。」克萊夫皺着眉深思着。他忽然看見他朋友脖子上，掛着一條細金練，下面還垂着一個小金匣。他從前亦曾看見過的。但是這次他却不知不覺的將那東西擎在手裏。（未完）</p>

<p>(Harbin) The eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway has recently been somewhat peaceful, but today a band of bandits demolished the tracks on the bridge near the Maoershan station (transliteration), ambushed near the bridge, intending to loot when a westbound train derailed. However, they were seen by a passerby, who urgently signaled the train to stop, and their plan failed. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Passengers Traveling Out of Shanhaiguan on the Peiping-Shenyang Train Are Blocked at Yu Pass and Forced to Return <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) According to some passengers who arrived in Peiping on the Peiping-Shenyang train this morning, they left Peiping for Shenyang on the 14th. When they arrived at Yu Pass yesterday, they were ordered to disembark and stay in Yu Pass for a limited time because the Japanese did not allow Chinese people to leave the pass. The fare for their direct tickets was refunded at half price by the station there. They were never informed of the reason for being blocked from leaving the pass. They also said that a company called the "Great East Company" in Yu Pass used to sell "entry permits" for three mao each, but not long ago, the price suddenly increased to one yuan and three mao. Starting from the 14th, they were ordered to stop selling them, and at the same time, anyone without an entry permit was absolutely forbidden from leaving the pass. In the past two days, the number of passengers from Peiping, Tianjin, and other places traveling to the Northeast who were blocked at Yu Pass reached more than a thousand. According to the railway bureau and related parties, they have not yet received a confirmed report. They also said that the through train between Peiping and Shenyang was originally requested by the Japanese, with the reason being to facilitate transportation. If passengers are now really not allowed to leave the pass, the through train will become ineffective. It is uncertain whether this is accurate or not. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than a thousand Chinese passengers who took the through train from Peiping and Tianjin to Guanwai on the 14th were suddenly rounded up by the puppet border police when they arrived at Shanhaiguan and prohibited from entering the territory. As a result, some passengers negotiated with the railway to get a refund for the Guanwai section of the ticket and returned to Peiping and Tianjin. The reason for the ban on leaving the pass is unknown. It is rumored that the Righteous Bravery Army near Suizhong on the puppet Fengshan Road destroyed the tracks, and the Japanese army is attacking, so traffic is blocked. However, the transportation authorities have not yet obtained confirmation of the facts. On the 15th and 16th, the stations on the Beining Railway still sold through tickets to Guanwai as usual. It is still unknown whether passengers can leave the pass. The Great East Company in Shanhaiguan sells puppet state entry permits, originally selling them for three jiao each. Recently, due to the large number of laborers leaving the pass to make a living, the fee has been increased to one yuan per person. However, even at one yuan each, it is not easy to buy one in the past three days. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e23">After Reading "The 23rd Year Business Report of Jin Cheng Bank" <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Among Chinese banks that annually compile business reports detailing the economic situation at home and abroad, as well as the bank's operational performance, and distribute them to shareholders, besides the two in Shanghai, recently Jin Cheng Bank has followed suit. We know that the two banks in Shanghai both belong to the Jiang-Zhe banking group, and their investment and lending interests seem to be centered in Shanghai and focused on the Yangtze River basin. However, Jin Cheng is different. Its head office is located in Tianjin, and it is a pillar among the "Four Northern Banks" (referring to Jin Cheng Bank, Yieh Commercial Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, and the Continental Bank). It subtly holds the reins of the financial world in North China. Therefore, the manifestations of its active business are slightly different. At a time when the situation in North China is severe, the publication of this business report by the bank is of profound significance.</p>
<p>What the Jin Cheng Bank's business report reveals to us is that Jin Cheng Bank is not just an ordinary commercial bank. From an analysis and observation of its lending operations, in addition to general industrial and commercial businesses, its direction seems to focus on assisting transportation and mining industries and mineral products. The total of these two lending items accounts for about one-fifth of the total. The high proportion of this component is probably unmatched by any other bank. The prosperity or decline of railways and mining industries is related to the lifeblood of the national industry and commerce. The bank's authorities, with their unique vision, are dedicated to assisting this sector, which is of no small benefit to the national economy. Now, the government authorities are gradually seeing the beginnings of old road repairs, and the construction of new lines is also being actively carried out, and mining merchants in various places are also making great efforts to reorganize in order to seek revitalization. At this time, we have high expectations for the bank authorities, who have always supported the road and mining industries, hoping that they will take the development of road and mining as their future mission in addition to ordinary banking business. If this is the case, the foundation of China's specialized banks can be expected to be established, and its effectiveness will far outweigh the wandering and indecisiveness of today's general commercial banks.</p>
<p>From a financial perspective, the fiercest competition with our banking and money industry comes from foreign banks. However, the existing capital of Chinese banks is still insufficient to compete with those backed by international capital. Therefore, if the Chinese banking sector wants to compete with foreign banks and navigate the international financial market, it must first increase its capital. For the sake of increasing capital, there are precedents in various countries for bank alliances and mergers. Money shops and small banks should be encouraged to unite or merge. Even large banks should also make this preparation as a leader. In this way, the entire front of our banking and money industry can be expected to be consolidated. The bank and the authorities of the "Four Northern Banks" had long seen that bank alliances are the way out for China's financial industry. The organization of the Four Banks Reserve Treasury Savings Association in the 12th year of the Republic, and the establishment of the Four Banks Joint Business Office last year, both pioneered the trend in China's financial sector. The capital increase and expansion of the Taiping Insurance Company (jointly established by the Four Banks and the Bank of Communications and China National Bank) is even more a manifestation of cooperation among the industry. However, in our view, the joint operation of several banks may still be insufficient to meet the future needs of China's financial industry. The most effective method seems to still need further unity.</p>
<p>The publication of Jin Cheng Bank's business report is still a first attempt. However, its broad perspective and detailed analysis can be called unprecedented. However, it seems to still focus on Shanghai in the domestic economic situation and fails to analyze and penetrate the changes in the economic status of North China, the rise and fall of Tianjin Port, and the rise and fall of industries. This is perhaps a slight disappointment for those seeking economic research data on North China.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan is drafting cigarette tax regulations, and Wei Tingsheng and others have successively gone to Shanghai to investigate the types and grades of cigarettes. It has been a year and a wealth of materials has been collected. However, because the quality and price of foreign cigarette products are very different from those of Chinese merchants, in order to make the domestic cigarette industry bear an average burden, it is planned to divide the cigarette tax rate into several grades to make up for this. At the same time, in order to respect the opinions of the financial authorities, the opinions will be provided to the Ministry of Finance for reference, and the Ministry of Finance will be asked to consider and draft them before submitting them for review. Currently, the Ministry of Finance has sent the regulations to the Legislative Yuan, and Commissioner Chen Jianru will convene a preliminary review within days to determine the principles and send them to the Finance and Economic Committees for a joint meeting to review them before submitting them to the General Assembly for approval.

<h3 id="e58">French Chamber of Deputies Passes Extension of Military Service Bill, Extending from One Year to Two Years, Strengthening Military Strength, Germany Also Announces Immediate Implementation of Conscription <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) When the government of Dunsu sleeves made an important statement this morning in Congress when passing the bill to extend the term of military service, it was rumored that Britain and the Soviet Union had requested France to increase the number of active servicemen. Congress passed the bill to increase the term of military service from one year to two years by 389 votes to 190 votes. Military experts declared that the bill could in fact double the number of active servicemen in France. According to the number of soldiers in France's army, it is second only to the Soviet Union. After passing the bill, Congress passed the government's confidence vote by 354 votes to 210 votes. Observers believe that Helleu's remarks are noteworthy. Helleu declared to Congress, "If you know what we know, then no one in Congress will oppose the government." Some members of Congress believe that Helleu's words imply that Britain and the Soviet Union have requested France to increase its military strength. When Premier Flandin debated the bill, he cited Germany's rearmament, saying, "Now we can prove with numbers that the expansion of Germany's military strength is enough to put France's army in danger. Since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, the relationship between France and Germany has changed. Since then, it has violated the Treaty of Versailles and carried out the restoration of military equipment." According to the military service bill passed today, the term of service for those who enlist in mid-April will be increased to 18 months, and the term of service for subsequent grades will be two years. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government issued a declaration today, stating that Germany had violated the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles restricting its armaments and intended to establish an air force. The declaration was issued in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, stating that when Germany unilaterally increased its combat strength, France's combat strength could not be allowed to fall for a moment. The French government cannot tolerate Germany's actions more than the British government. The term of military service for new recruits called up in mid-April 1935 has been increased from one year to 18 months. Those called up in mid-October 1935 and those called up in the next four years will be increased to two years. The government has submitted a bill to the House of Representatives today, stipulating that the age of military service will be gradually reduced from 21 to 20 and that mercenaries will be recruited. The bill clearly states that this plan is not intended to increase the regular quota of 230,000 soldiers, but to make up for the decrease in the birth rate in the years of the war. If this is not done, France's army will be reduced to 118,000 by 1940. The conclusion of the government's declaration calls on Congress to inspire patriotism, agree with the government's measures, and said that the military equipment maintained by France is only necessary to protect peace and security and to prevent aggressors from achieving their desires.

<p>(Berlin) The German government has decided on Germany's general military equipment and will immediately implement a compulsory military service system. Today, German leader Hitler issued a proclamation on this matter, and Minister of Propaganda Goebbels read this document to foreign news interviewers. What is now known is that Germany's peacetime standing army will be 12 legions and 36 divisions. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, after learning that the French parliament passed a bill to extend military service, newspapers here have used headlines such as "France dealt a fatal blow to disarmament," "France is the gravedigger of disarmament," and "Disarmament is dead" to write about it on the front page. The newspapers also wrote critical remarks, unanimously expressing disappointment with France's policy of expanding its military strength. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Debates in the French Chamber of Deputies on the Military Service Bill: The Socialist Party Appeals for Peace and Opposes a Napoleonic-Style Army <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies today discussed the bill to extend the term of military service until late into the night. After Prime Minister Flandin explained the reasons for the government's proposal, Socialist Deputy Blum, representing the orthodox Socialist Party, spoke out against extending the term of military service, advocating "making the most sublime appeal for peace to the world." He stated that the government's proposed two-year military service bill was intended to improve the quality of the army and that the situation was similar to that of 1913-1914. He claimed that the government was preparing a large-scale Napoleonic-style offensive plan. Following this, Foppé, Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Army Committee, analyzed the current state of the German army and its military supplies. Foppé stated, "Regarding the state of French military preparations, there is no reason for Germany to rearm. Germany should bear sole responsibility for the expansion of armaments. In the past year, Germany has increased its defense forces from 200,000 to 600,000 men, and its reserve forces from 100,000 to 400,000 men. The military industry is intensifying its work, and all civilian aviation has been converted to military aviation. This warmongering spirit of Germany inevitably makes all of Europe, and even Russia, uneasy. Now, the French government cannot propose a clear and frank military bill, leaving the size of the French army uncertain and making mobilization difficult. This is regrettable." Foppé also stated that the general advocacy of abolishing the army is despicable. One should know that the Soviet Red Army has also increased from 600,000 to 940,000 men. In conclusion, he stated, "I am deeply aware of our people's belief in peace and their desire for security, but the cabinet's declaration is far from sufficient." During the Chamber of Deputies' recess, the Radical Party held a caucus. After a speech by Minister Without Portfolio Herriot, the entire caucus voted to support the government's proposal, with 30 deputies abstaining. Subsequently, the Chamber of Deputies continued the debate, and it is expected that a vote on the bill will not be taken until late into the night. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The bill to extend the term of military service has been passed in the Chamber of Deputies. The discussion and voting situation is as follows: A Communist deputy rose to speak against it after Foppé, Chairman of the Army Committee, saying that the two-year military service system is a threat of a new war. Former Minister of Finance Reynaud of the Republican Center Party stated that most countries, such as Britain, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia, have reluctantly increased military spending due to Hitler's Germany. In France, it is necessary to focus on the substance of the army and form elite troops composed of specialized personnel in order to resist attacks. Minister Without Portfolio Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, enthusiastically supported the bill to extend the term of military service, saying, "The news is very serious. What you know may not be as detailed as what I know. Otherwise, your applause and support will be the first to come." Former Prime Minister Daladier of the same party believed that reorganizing the army was better than extending the term of military service. Independent Deputy Pouis said that he opposed gradually extending military service to two years and advocated extending it directly. When the debate concluded, various parties proposed a total of three motions: (1) proposed by the Socialist Party, stating, "The Chamber of Deputies refuses to increase the military burden before seeking public opinion." The government raised a vote of confidence on this motion, and the Chamber of Deputies rejected it by a vote of 309 to 109. (2) Proposed by Foppé, Chairman of the Army Committee, expressing confidence in the government but demanding that the government propose a bill to reorganize the army, with the situation of German rearmament as the goal. The government opposed this motion and also raised a vote of confidence, which the Chamber of Deputies rejected by a vote of 530 to 44. Socialist deputies also voted against this motion. (3) Proposed by former Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac, stating, "The Chamber of Deputies trusts the government and expresses its approval of the government's declaration." The government accepted this motion and raised a vote of confidence. As a result, the Chamber of Deputies finally passed it by a vote of 350 to 196. Among the deputies of the Radical Socialist Party, only 32 voted against it, and the rest expressed their support. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon delivered a speech in Swansea today, vigorously defending Britain's increase in defense capabilities. Simon stated that it is absolutely necessary for us to increase our sense of security and seek a disarmament agreement. He also said that if he and Lord Privy Seal Eden can achieve success during their upcoming tour of Europe, a disarmament convention may be concluded, and the League of Nations and the collective peace system may be consolidated as a result. Simon also cited the Manchurian problem, clarifying the difficulty of resolving international disputes by invoking the principles of the League of Nations, stating that the League of Nations' handling of the Manchurian incident has caused Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations, but some people are still demanding more severe measures. Simon further stated that the recent actions of Japan, Germany, Russia, and the United States have not only failed to disarm but have expanded armaments. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon recently delivered a speech in Swansea, Wales, outlining the visit to Berlin, stating, "If this visit to Germany can achieve something, it will not only help ease the European situation but also make it possible for the disarmament agreement we have been longing for to be established. The British government also attaches great importance to Lord Privy Seal Eden's visit to Russia and Poland. Our visits to these three countries are of great significance. We sincerely hope to obtain the sincere cooperation of the governments of these three countries to promote international understanding, as international understanding is what we are most concerned about. Moreover, peace is not a partial issue but the main goal of British foreign policy, and it is also the common expectation of all the British people. Some people believe that Britain does not have the firm intention to support the League of Nations, and there is no greater fallacy than this, because the British government is committed to building a collective system to maintain peace." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The Havas Agency's correspondent in London has learned that British diplomatic circles believe that before Britain and Germany discuss the issue of German rearmament in Berlin, the German government and British cabinet members must first reach a principled agreement on the East European Mutual Assistance Pact. How to restore friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union will be the first goal of the Anglo-German talks in Berlin. After this issue is resolved, the second issue, the conclusion of a Danube River Pact to guarantee Austria's independence, will be discussed. As a third step, British cabinet members will ask Germany to sign an arms limitation treaty. Only after the above security issues are resolved can the issue of German rearmament continue to be discussed. However, no final conclusion can be reached on the issue of German rearmament during the period when British cabinet members visit Berlin. After Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden return to their country, they will first report to the British cabinet on the results achieved on security issues and rearmament issues, and then consult with the French and Italian governments before the British government can make a final decision.

British authorities believe that this article indicates that the future resolution of Central European events can be expected to be smooth and unobstructed.

<p>(London) According to a statement issued by the Hejaz Embassy in London, King Ibn Saud of Hejaz and Nejd and his eldest son, Emir Saud, narrowly escaped assassination during morning prayers today. As the King was circling the Kaaba four times, several people suddenly rushed towards the King with sharp blades. Just before the King reached the Black Stone, the leader of the assassins lunged at him. Seeing this, the Crown Prince stepped forward to block him, and the assassin retreated slightly. Just as he was about to move forward again, a guard shot and killed him. At that time, the other assassins attacked the Crown Prince, but before they could strike, they were all knocked down by the guards. The King and the Crown Prince calmly completed the seven rounds of circling the Kaaba. After the ceremony, they happily received the delegation that came to offer congratulations, as is customary after completing the pilgrimage to the holy site. The assassins were all Zaydis from Yemen. It is said that Ibn Saud fought with Yemen last year, so the purpose of this assassination must have been revenge. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Congressman Torrens today proposed to the House of Representatives a large-scale development of Midway Island and Wake Island as Pacific aviation bases, with expenses reaching $4 million. The proposal calls for an immediate allocation of $700,000 to improve the ports of the two islands to facilitate the takeoff and landing of aircraft, and also advocates that the U.S. Department of Commerce set up aviation bureaus on each island, equip ships, and report weather conditions by radio. The estimated cost of ships and equipment is $3 million, and the government must also assume annual operating expenses of $200,000. It is impossible to predict the government's attitude towards this proposal, as Japan has already expressed its belief that the United States' establishment of commercial aviation bases on the islands is merely an attempt to conceal its consolidation of Pacific defenses. Pan American Airways has already been granted government approval to install a broadcasting radio station in Alameda, California, as part of the facilities for the Sino-American air route.

<p>(Washington) The issue of Philippine independence is of concern to the U.S. government today.

Murphy also listed the Philippines' urgent needs as follows: (1) $1 million for public works, flood control projects, sanitation, and road construction; (2) $100,000 to eradicate locusts in the Philippines; (3) An investigation of food to adjust production restriction plans, with expenses of $25,000; (4) Reclamation of wasteland, with expenses of $1 million; (4) Purchase of sugar. Governor Murphy also telegraphed the Vice-Governor of the Philippines, asking him to immediately formulate detailed rules for each plan in preparation for Undersecretary of Agriculture Wallace, and said that he hoped that this request would be approved because this request is not only urgent but also purely a job relief plan. Murphy also discussed Philippine finances with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Postal Minister Farley. Murphy also said that every time he meets with government officials, he asks to listen to the statements of the Philippine delegation in good faith. The independence of the Philippines is an important issue for the United States. It is now believed that the words and deeds of Philippine leaders can understand the aspirations of the Filipinos. He has asked President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Secretary of War Dern to meet with the Philippine delegation as soon as possible so that the delegation can make a statement to the government. When he met with government officials, he had agreed to send an envoy to the Philippine Republic. The government hopes to submit the Philippine constitution to the President as soon as possible.

<p>(London) The anxiety caused by Belgium's maintenance of the gold standard has led European countries to compete to purchase sterling today, so the price of sterling in terms of dollars and other gold coins has suddenly rebounded. The dollar fell from $4.75625 to $4.7975, the French franc fell from 72.09 to 72.78, and the Belgian franc fell from 20.37 to 20.59. The market price fluctuated greatly throughout the day due to public unrest. Belgian franc transactions have recently been quite difficult, as today's one-month term discount rate is nominally 70 centimes, while the three-month term discount rate is 120 centimes. As a result of the rebound in sterling, the price of gold fell by one shilling and seven and a half pence per net ounce to 146 shillings and a half pence, and then to 145 shillings. However, due to the unstable exchange rate trend, many buyers are hesitant. The stock exchange is currently discussing what impact gold will have if the "gold bloc" collapses. Insiders say that when the United States is preparing to purchase at a price of $35 per ounce and the New York-London exchange rate is below $5, the price of gold must be above 140 shillings.

<p>Oslo: The Norwegian Liberal Party government, formed by Mowinckel on March 1, 1933, has been stable, but today the Labor Party in the parliament demanded increased funding to alleviate unemployment. The government opposed it, saying that if so, the tax rate would inevitably increase. When the vote was taken, the Labor Party's proposal was passed by 95 votes to 55, so the government resigned immediately. The Labor Party is currently forming a new government, with Speaker of Parliament Nygaardsvold as Prime Minister. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Oslo: Liberal Prime Minister Mowinckel announced that the current government will resign today, predicting that Norway will have its first Labor cabinet. According to official sources, King Haakon VII will appoint Labor leader Nygaardsvold to form a new government. Prime Minister Mowinckel refused the request of the leaders of the Labor and Farmers' Parties to increase emergency funds by 10 million kroner, and the parliament immediately passed a vote of no confidence in the government. The Mowinckel cabinet then resigned. Observers say that the requested funds would have to be met by issuing bonds or increasing taxes. Parliament passed the vote of no confidence by 94 votes to 65. It is said that Mowinckel's resignation this time is similar to the situation when he took office as Prime Minister for the third time. Observers say that Norway's exports in 1934 accounted for the highest amount since the war, so some cabinet members did not believe that it was necessary to increase 10 million kroner. Norway's officially announced unemployment rate is about 35,000, slightly higher than last year, but the government believes that since business has the prospect of prosperity, it should be able to absorb these unemployed people in a short period of time. It is now heard that Nygaardsvold will be ordered to form a new cabinet. Nygaardsvold is the speaker of the upper house and has been involved in the labor movement for a long time. The Norwegian Labor Party does not belong to the Second or Third International and is more radical than other Labor parties in Europe, and it also occupies more seats in parliament than other political parties, so it is not yet certain whether Nygaardsvold will ask other political parties to participate in the formation of the cabinet.

<h3 id="e71">Japanese House of Representatives: Commends Yukio Ozaki for Over Thirty Years of Struggle for Constitutional Government <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives met at 1:00 p.m. today to hold a commendation ceremony for Representative Yukio Ozaki. Ozaki has been continuously elected as a representative for more than thirty years since the Japanese government opened the first Diet. To this day, his contribution to constitutional government has been great. Vice-Speaker Uehara was the first to take the podium, explaining Ozaki's active involvement in the political world and his various contributions. Then, he proposed to commend Ozaki, requesting everyone's consent. With unanimous approval, the proposal was passed. After Speaker Hamada read the commendation, Ozaki took the stage to give a speech. His speech was as follows: "I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the commendation from you today. However, I regret that I cannot share this happy event with Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi, who has worked together for politics since the first Imperial Diet." (Applause from the whole house) "I am not the only one who has struggled for constitutional government, but it is regrettable that those who are still alive receive this honor, while the dead have not seen this move. If the two major political parties today are healthy and developed and see the commendation, there is no greater joy than this. However, I am saddened by the current state of decline of political parties, and it is a great pain to see today's event. The majority of the responsibility for the decline of constitutional government should be borne by us, and I am extremely ashamed to be commended by you today." Ozaki then spoke in detail about the decline of political parties, and the hall was silent. Ozaki continued, "I have served as a minister twice and have been awarded the rank of Senior Third Rank and the First Order of Merit. However, many have struggled for constitutional government for forty-three years without receiving this grace, and the world does not find it strange. This is evidence of a lack of understanding of constitutional politics and a sign of respecting officials and despising the people." Ozaki's words of gratitude for the commendation turned into a fierce denunciation of the current government. Ozaki then turned his criticism to the political parties, saying that the reason for the corruption of political parties lies in the fact that they cannot gain power without money or power. This is something you are already familiar with. Ozaki then gave various warnings and bitter words to each political party before descending from the podium, and the whole hall applauded thunderously. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The German National Question <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>(Correspondence from the National News Agency in Germany) Dr. Gidd, a eugenics expert at the University of Berlin, made the following remarks to reporters: The future of a nation and its history are extremely long and far-reaching. We have already conducted in-depth research into the natural phenomena of the plant and animal kingdoms, but our knowledge of national physiological issues and the study of the survival of various civilized nations remains stagnant. Some people like to compare a nation to an individual, dividing life into three periods: youth, middle age, and old age. This type of division is fundamentally flawed. The survival of a nation is not comparable to a clock. Machinery can sometimes stop, but if a nation has a strong will and courage, it can last forever. The reasons for a nation's demise are often due to civil war, disease, and the transformation of social culture. These nations have destroyed the necessary conditions for their national reproduction and survival. Furthermore, ethnic mixing and changes in national character can also lead to a gradual decrease in population, causing the country's culture to decline day by day. However, this kind of observation is still insufficient to explain the reasons for a nation's decline; this is just a superficial observation. If we further study the essential elements of a nation's survival, we must create the fate of the nation ourselves. If various nations still do not understand this true meaning, maintaining the reproduction of the race and nation will inevitably lead to danger in the future. Anyone who understands Mendel's laws of heredity and succession will have a national concept and will be able to understand the value of national politics. We must stay away from anything that hinders the maintenance of a nation's survival, so as not to prevent national reproduction. We must regard anything that can promote family health as the nation's greatest political priority, view it as a sacred duty, and resolve to implement it to achieve good results.</p>
<p>We should imprint in our minds all things that can promote healthy families and use them as the standard for determining overall national policy. We must take the survival of the entire German nation as our own responsibility, act according to this principle, and work for the common good. In this regard, we can observe that the current German government's laws since taking power fully demonstrate the government's emphasis on national politics and national service. The state, according to its laws, is the ruler of the masses, and everyone is a builder of the nation every day. At present, the national service undertaking is not only about our leader Hitler's struggle for freedom and for the nation, but also needs to be maintained under Hitler's guidance.  The goal is to preserve the nation's position and the health of its descendants, and purify the nation. The National Socialist government has the courage to save its own nation from crisis, resist all fallacies against the health of descendants and pure national families, and the people of the whole country help each other so that the actual effects will be gradually realized in the future. Special priority is given to children, so that families with healthy offspring will inevitably continue to appear with ideal procedures, implemented step by step. Therefore, our primary concept is to focus on the maternal aspect. German women are responsible for Germany's future, so there are laws that give them special protection. Furthermore, we must reach the point where women are trained early in marriage and family life. This one move alone will be enough to permanently solve the unemployment problem. Our national service is an undertaking for the sake of public health. It also focuses on protecting women who have not yet given birth or women in similar situations, preventing the spread of racial diseases and hereditary diseases. On the contrary, it aims to ensure that everyone has a good and happy family, and there are laws to prevent sick and hereditary conditions. These laws are re-established by government offices that are enthusiastic about national affairs.</p>
<p>If a country's national undertakings want to increase the inheritance of descendants, it must pay attention to the healthy migration of farmers. If this is done, the descendants of the entire nation can be healthy. Bloodline heredity has a close relationship with the country and its birthplace. If a country wants to carry out national undertakings, it must develop the national consciousness education of young people, so that the entire nation has a national concept. It is also necessary to promote early marriage for young people, promote scientific research, and promote sports so that fallacies that aim for freedom and internationalism and organizations that undermine public happiness are quickly eliminated because their theories want to go beyond the social stage, causing everyone to marry late and delay establishing families, resulting in general youth remaining widows and spinsters. We must not only pay attention to the material aspects of the country. The country must fulfill its responsibility to young people, maintain the nation's bloodline, so that all young people in the country have happy marriages, have their own families, and work hard for racial and national undertakings. National service undertakings are carried out in stages, and the establishment of families is extremely developed. Family and national studies are the golden rules handed down from generation to generation, used to build the country. The reduction in population reproduction rates is a national physiological danger, which is really caused by too much genetic inheritance of national diseases, as well as ethnic mixing and changes in national character. Even in civilized countries, if this phenomenon occurs, the national physiological danger will inevitably occur. Even the spirit of national unity will be sharply reduced. This kind of national change is not only in Europe, but also inevitable all over the world. The work of the National Socialist movement, in the recognition of descendants and eugenics, establishes the physiological foundation of various nations in the world with great impetus. Therefore, Germany not only in the domestic aspect, but also in the diplomatic aspect, follows this path, so that all white nations can enter the highest stage of economy and culture. If the German government is wholeheartedly focused on building national descendants and the knowledge of eugenics, implementing policies for the health of descendants and national policies, some people suspect that Germany will inevitably become estranged from other nations in the future and despise other nations. Such a inference is extremely inappropriate. We will never put the crisis of terrifying nations everywhere and the facts of national standards out of our minds.</p>
<p>The German nation is only asking for freedom and equality so that it can maintain its national position and enrich and develop Germany's economy and culture as the center of Europe, so that Germany has surplus power to save the decay of European nations and help the economic and cultural crises of various nations.</p>

<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London: The price of gold today is 145 shillings and 5 pence, a decrease of 7.5 pence compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>London: The spot price of silver today is 27.125 pence, a decrease of 1/875; the forward price is 27.25 pence, a decrease of 1/25. India sold, and China and speculators bought when the price fell. The market closed steadily.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: In the London foreign exchange market this morning, Europe continued to buy British pounds, so the price of the British pound continued to be strong. The British-American exchange rate opened at $4.79125, half a cent lower than yesterday's US-British exchange rate close. This price was supported for quite a long time, then it trended upward. The closing price was $4.80025, 1.125 cents higher than the opening price.</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: Although there were expectations of a rebound in cotton prices in the New York cotton market, the price still plummeted when the market opened, falling almost one dollar per bale. The reason was that foreigners sold in large quantities. However, everyone felt that the cotton market was currently in a position of being oversold, but people were panicking and being affected. Printed cotton is in higher demand, and there is talk of canceling the cotton handling fee. If that happens, the number of workers employed in cotton mills can be greatly increased.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market had stable sentiment, and the opening price trended upward. Manufacturers bought, and there were reports of wind damage in the production areas.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Second Hami Incident</p>
<p>The indigenous ethnic groups of Xinjiang, since the Han Dynasty, have been nurtured by the culture of the Central Plains for over two thousand years. The emotions of the various ethnic groups, both old and new, residing together, have generally entered a stage of harmony. Although occasional ripples may arise, even evolving into a prairie fire situation, examining the driving force, it mostly does not originate from the lower masses of various ethnic groups but rather stems from a single thought of a few chieftains and leaders. If this thought is evil, bloodshed can occur for a thousand miles, as mentioned in the previous article regarding the widespread turmoil in Xinjiang. If this thought is good, it can easily transform conflict into friendship, as seen in the rise and fall of the Second Hami Incident described in this article.</p>
<p>The Second Hami Incident, tracing its beginning and end, resembles a sudden attack of stormy waves, arriving unexpectedly and then retreating swiftly. The main protagonist is Dr. Yao Lebos, the central figure of the previous turmoil. In February of the 23rd year [of the Republic of China, 1934], Ma Zhongying besieged Dihua but failed and retreated south. Yao, originally a staunch opponent of the new government, upon hearing the news in Turpan, quickly led his remaining troops to Hami and surrendered to the provincial government. He was appointed as the acting county magistrate and commander of the city defense. By August, the provincial government concluded its military affairs in southern Xinjiang and turned its attention to Hami as an important eastern route. Liu Yingpo was appointed as the administrative director, and a certain Xu was appointed as the garrison commander. Liu arrived in Hami first to take office, while Xu seemed to have reservations, arriving a month later with over four hundred elite soldiers, reaching Sanbao, three stations away from Hami.</p>
<p>Yao had an old relationship with Ma Zhongying. Although the provincial government entrusted him with an important battle, his heart was ultimately filled with unease. Now, upon learning of Xu's military affairs, he was even more frightened. Earlier, Nie Zier, the Little Prince of Hami, had a long-standing feud with Yao since childhood. After the death of the Sand King, Nie Zier inherited the position, and his relationship with Yao became even more strained. Although Yao still held the position of Chán [Muslim] tribe chief (bek) and continued as the battalion commander of the military camp, he did not go to the Prince's residence to work. This time, upon returning to Hami from Turpan, he disarmed Nie Zier's guards. Nie Zier was deeply resentful and secretly sent a confidant to Dihua, seeking help from Governor Sheng Shicai. Sheng specifically permitted Nie Zier to formally inherit the position and urged Xu to lead his troops to capture Hami as soon as possible. The confidant sent by Nie served as a guide for the army. Unexpectedly, he suddenly fled to Hami midway and revealed everything to Yao, saying that Xu's troops were actually coming to Hami to confiscate Yao's weapons to investigate his past crimes. He could not bear to see his fellow tribesmen being harmed, so he changed his mind and rushed to report the news. (Brothers quarreling at home defend against external aggression. Most ethnic groups who believe in Islam particularly possess this spirit.) Upon hearing this, Yao was filled with both gratitude and fear. He immediately appointed him as a regimental commander and secretly ordered all tribal families to hide in the mountains, with the able-bodied men supplementing the Chán army, setting up layers of defense on the western front. Nie Zier had just received a telegram from the province and posted a large red announcement of his inheritance in the Hui [Muslim] city when he was summoned by Yao to the new city and ordered to quickly produce one thousand taels of gold to prepare for Xu's troops' provisions. Nie was at a loss and was imprisoned for many days. Yao, having made up his mind to resist Xu, feared that preparations would be insufficient, so he pretended to discuss the matter of barracks and provisions with Administrative Director Liu Yinglin, requesting him to convey to Xu's troops to postpone their advance to Hami, allowing him to first communicate with the Chán people to facilitate a united welcome. In reality, the so-called communication was secretly dispatching chieftains to spread various anti-Xu propaganda to the Chán people. The Chán people, simple-minded, believed it to be true. The Kazakhs also echoed, declaring, "If Xu's army actually advances to Toubao (one station away from Hami city), we will first start by executing four Han Chinese leaders to resist the war. If they attack Toubao and advance to the garden city, and we cannot resist, we will decide to cleanse the city and retreat to the mountains." From then on, the whole city was in an uproar, as if a great disaster was imminent. Officials and gentry feared being the ones executed and felt a sense of impending doom. Subsequently, officials and gentry jointly telegraphed the provincial government repeatedly, requesting them to stop Xu's army from coming to Hami, with earnest wording, and the unspoken implication that Yao's troops could be held responsible. A certain chairman of the chamber of commerce also personally went to the military camp, requesting Xu not to advance hastily, but with Yao's welcoming representatives by his side, he ultimately did not dare to speak the truth directly. As Xu's army advanced to Erbao, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Fortunately, the provincial government's order to stop arrived in time, and a delegation from the Han-Hui joint Hami team, led by a certain foreign advisor, came to Hami in two cars. Yao treated them with great courtesy and hosted a grand banquet. After the advisor was full and drunk, he ordered Yao to hand over the weapons. Yao obediently listened and casually pointed to several Chán soldiers, saying, "So-and-so is a brigade commander, so-and-so is a regimental commander. From now on, all military power will be lifted, and it would be great to focus on county affairs." The advisor, unaware of the reality, rejoiced that a great achievement had been accomplished with ease. Yao then handed over the county seal, resigning from the position of county magistrate. The representatives felt even more relieved and urged Yao to gather his troops for inspection. Yao initially refused, saying he had no authority. Then, Chán and Kazakh militiamen swarmed in and suddenly imprisoned the representatives, confiscating their vehicles and equipment. Only then did the advisor and others realize they had been tricked and were shocked. They agreed to immediately telegraph the governor's office, guaranteeing Yao's promotion to Hami District Garrison Commander in order to escape danger. Yao casually agreed. Later, the provincial telegram arrived, "Approved as requested." Yao then released them and returned them to Dihua, even holding a farewell conference before their departure, requesting them to leave one car behind and instructing them to convey to the governor's office, "Please do not be hostile in the future, and quickly withdraw Xu's army. The situation here is calm and there is no need to increase troops. Now that I have been appointed as the Hami District Garrison Commander, I will work even harder to maintain law and order." Although the advisor and others knew that this trip had failed, they had no choice but to agree and leave. Shortly after, King Nie Zier of Hami paid 260 taels of gold and was able to regain his freedom. Xu's army, which had advanced to Erbao, also retreated to Turpan. This scene of a dangerous situation with stormy waves was thus calmed.</p>
<p>Yao's father was from Hunan, and his mother was a Chán woman from southern Xinjiang (Southern Xinjiang Chán women occasionally intermarried with Han Chinese. Hami religious rules are very strict, Chán tribes are only allowed to marry Han women, not Han men.) He is nearly fifty years old and has taken his fourth wife. His eldest son, Daochang, also has four wives, one of whom is a Han woman. Chán people commonly have multiple wives, and according to religious rules, they are treated equally and do not have the status of concubines. The Steel Department consultant Sven Hedin and his party, on their way east, passed through Hami, and various agencies held banquets to bid them farewell. Yao especially treated them with courtesy, enjoying endless conversations. Someone jokingly said, "Hedin is a doctor, and Yao is also called a doctor. They met late in life, no wonder they are so attached to each other." The next morning, Hedin hurriedly left Hami, and Yao did not have time to see him off, jokingly telling the reporter, "This old man is traveling in a hurry, probably fearing that I would detain his car." Later, Hedin returned to Gansu territory and re-entered Xinjiang via Dunhuang, indeed lingering at the site of the ancient Loulan Kingdom for many days before returning east, which shows Yao's personality.</p>

<p>Annihilating Several Hundred Elements of the False Central Government; Key Figure Ruan Xiaoxian Also Shot Dead</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The remnant bandits in Jiangnan, led by Ye Jianying, Chen Yi, Xiang Ying, and others, numbering about 40,000 to 50,000, have been stirring up trouble separately in recent days. On one hand, they are using scattered bandits to harass Jiangnan; on the other hand, they are sending bandits to attempt to cross the Hunan border to connect with Guizhou bandits. Therefore, in recent days, Jiangxi bandits have been invading southward through multiple routes. On the 4th of this month, about 2,000 members of the false 24th Division attacked Anyuan City from Huichang. Bandit traces were discovered in the Banshi and Chongshi areas. The [Unit/Division name unreadable due to blurring in source] regiment of the [Unit/Division name unreadable due to blurring in source] Division stationed in Xinfeng was dispatched to intercept them. They engaged in a major battle with the bandits on the 6th, and the bandits were unsuccessful. At the same time, a portion of the Communist bandits, led by Xiang Ying, Chen Yi, and Ye Jianying, also committed crimes near Ganxian through various routes. Our [Unit/Division name unreadable due to blurring in source] Division has been in intense battle with the bandits in the Jinsha, Xiazhu Keng, Shiliao, and Luokeng areas for three days and three nights. From the 4th to the 6th, they have already defeated the main force of the bandits. We have just received a telegram from Yu Hanmou on the 8th, stating that according to the face-to-face report from Division Commander Mo, the [Unit/Division name unreadable due to blurring in source] regiment annihilated the important central organs of the bandits on the 5th and 6th in Tangcun, on the border with Lingdu, killing over 300 bandits and capturing over 700, including important bandit criminals such as pseudo-Central Committee member Liu Bojian, Ruan Xiaoxian, and the chief of staff's secretary (according to reports, the key Communist bandit Ruan Xiaoxian was a member of the Communist bandit's pseudo-Central Committee, concurrently serving as a member of the pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Committee, and key positions such as the pseudo-Central Secretary, and was shot dead in Shangshui Keng; this unit of bandits was the pseudo-General Supply Department, and the Jiangnan regiment, as well as the pseudo-24th Division), etc. According to the report from [Unit] Commander [Unreadable], our regiment encountered the Communist bandits' pseudo-Jiangnan Regiment 1, 2, and 3 at Jinsha, Shiliao, Yachikeng, and other places on the 5th and 6th, engaging in fierce battles all day, killing on the spot the pseudo-special envoy commander Luo Kehai, the pseudo-detachment leader, and over 200 others, capturing the pseudo-Jiangnan Military Region political director Liu Bojian, secretary Liao Gekun, chief of staff Ye Rulong, transportation section chief Lian Desheng, trade bureau director Wang Zhikai, and over 700 others, seizing 7 light machine guns and 450 rifles. According to the prisoners, the bandits attempted to develop guerrilla warfare to protect the Jiangnan bandit area. The bandits killed this time were the backbone of the pseudo-Jiangnan bandits. Our troops are currently searching the deep mountains around Tangcun, Shangshui Keng, and Luokeng. Yesterday, another telegram stated that several hundred bandits were near Changluo Ao on the 7th, and a team is currently being dispatched to suppress them. According to the captured bandits, this unit is the Yuxi Independent Battalion, coming from Lefeng, intending to secretly cross the west. Our First Regiment's two battalions have returned to Changluo and have been defeating the pseudo-Independent Third Regiment in the Diya Meiziyuan Tangtou Ao area for days, killing dozens including the pseudo-battalion commander and political commissar, and capturing dozens including the battalion and company commanders and political commissars. Our army has dispatched the captured pseudo-battalion commander to the mountains near Diya to collect the scattered bandits, issuing each a certificate so that the advancing troops will know, (March 10)</p>

<p>Li Zekun, chief of the First Branch of the Tinglin Public Security Bureau, was reported for bribery and releasing morphine offenders Sun Jichen and Shen Zhangshi, and fled with his family. It has been many days since. Director He of the Public Security Bureau returned to the bureau from the province a few days ago and immediately detained Li's brother Jifu and the branch bureau staff member Que Jizhou, submitting them to the county government for verification. On one hand, he secretly dispatched officers to search everywhere. Now, Fei Gongxia, the captain of the water patrol team, has captured Li Zekun in the Wangyifang Bridge Kuai Xueshi Street area of Suzhou and escorted him back to Songjiang, submitting him to the county government for interrogation and verification.</p>

<p>Li Jincheng, the first squad leader of the security team stationed in Jiangzhuang, suddenly heard gongs and cries for help from the northeast corner around 12 o'clock on the night of the 12th. He immediately led the team to investigate and saw a crowd gathered in one place. Upon seeing the team, they swam away and scattered. A suspected thief was captured, who identified himself as Cai Niannong, 30 years old, residing in Xihutang, Caojing Township. He confessed to conspiring with others to rob the home of Gu Jinhu in Xiawutu, Majing Township, District Seven, but failed. A stolen boat was also seized and returned to the team headquarters for interrogation on the 15th.</p>

<p>The home of Zhu Ronggou, a villager in Nanli Xu, Central Street, Sanchang City, caught fire due to a child carelessly playing with matches at 10 AM yesterday. Suddenly, thick smoke filled the air, and flames soared. Zhu urgently called for neighbors to help put out the fire, but the wind was strong, and the fire spread rapidly, making it difficult to contain. In an instant, eight thatched houses and furniture were completely burned, and a five-year-old girl failed to escape and was buried in the inferno. The body was charred and horrifying to witness. It is reported that the total loss is estimated at over 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>When former County Magistrate Wu Bogeng left office, he owed the provincial government over 10,000 yuan. Later, considering that it was during the Communist bandit disturbances and the situation was special, the Department of Finance approved the write-off of over 3,900 yuan in administrative expenses overruns and over 4,800 yuan in special expenses related to bandit suppression, leaving a remaining deficit of over 3,319 yuan. The province ordered a strict pursuit. The county's public property department, etc., considered that former County Magistrate Wu had contributed greatly to bandit suppression, and the deficit owed to the province was due to public service, and requested the Department of Finance to waive the pursuit. The Department of Finance, based on the report, instructed the county government to convene a meeting of local agencies and groups on the 15th to discuss mitigation methods. It was resolved that since former County Magistrate Wu was unable to raise funds and the local government was unable to make up for the deficiency, but the deficit was incurred due to public service and was in response to special circumstances, the province should waive the pursuit.</p>

<p>The river surface in the Baitang Embankment area of the county is wide and has always been a place where bandits emerge. Passing ships are often robbed. Around 9 PM the night before (the 15th), a civilian ship was passing through Baitang Embankment when it suddenly encountered three bandit ships with thirty to forty bandits, each armed with guns and weapons, trying to rob silver, foreign currency, and clothes. Upon seeing the situation, the crew frantically shouted for help. The No. 5 and No. 7 patrol boats of the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, stationed at Doumen Bridge, heard the news and immediately went to pursue them. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire to resist. Officer Ye Tingzhang of the No. 7 patrol boat led the police to return fire. The sound of gunfire was rapid and dense, like a string of pearls, lasting for four or five minutes. Officer Ye ran out of ammunition, so he ran to Qinxiang Town and notified the 34th detachment of the Shitouwan Chamber of Commerce by telephone, which then reported to the 15th detachment of Kaizhou and the security teams at Beiqifang Yanqiao, requesting each to send a team to assist. Seeing a large number of merchant groups arriving, the bandits were outnumbered and fled in all directions. In addition to dispatching all the staff of the Supervision Division and the detectives of the Detective Team, the Public Security Bureau also ordered the car patrol team to go to catch them. Yan Heling, the captain of the 9th detachment of the 2nd District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Bureau stationed in Wuxi, also sent Officer Xiang Wengui, leading more than ten team members, to rush to the Gaoqiao area to pursue them. Because it was night, there was no effective protection.</p>

<p>Shanghai Xinhua Foreign Company recently received a tip-off that the Xincheng Printing Factory on Jiaoji Road in this county was counterfeiting the trademark of Youteermi Bai Zhuo Wan, a drug sold by the company. The company immediately sent its representative lawyer Fu Wanghou to Wuxi a few days ago, and reported it to the police on Jiaoji Road. More than 40 counterfeit trademarks were found inside the Xincheng Printing Factory. The owner of the factory, Wu Wenbin, and the person involved, Xu Zhaosheng, were brought to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After the investigators of the Bureau opened a court hearing, and other people, such as Li Haosheng and Zhang Hantao, were implicated. Because the case was related to counterfeiting trademarks, the case was immediately submitted to the General Bureau, and yesterday, they were transferred to the local branch court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Outside the North Gate of this county, there is a famous ancient temple called Qingliang Chan Temple (also known as Sanfeng Temple), a very popular incense burning site. It is currently presided over by Abbot Yixi, a monk who graduated from a certain Buddhist school in Japan. The temple was built in the Tang Dynasty and contains many ancient artifacts, books, and paintings. On the 12th of this month, Jiang Canran, the current manager of the local telephone company, Shen Zhuqing, the owner of the Kaitai Rice Mill, and Zhang Shenzhi, an engineer from Beijing, and others came. Because they were drinking too much, they complained that the monks were not hospitable enough, so they started arguing and actually destroyed the Buddhist hall (that is, the abbot's room). In addition to the table lamps and sundries on the table, three exquisite sandalwood wooden Buddha statues were broken, and the dharma seat was also overturned. Among them, there was also the most precious dragon head crutch (dharma staff), which was said to have been passed down from the Han Dynasty, and has been more than 500 years old. It was considered a rare treasure, and it was also broken. At that time, Jiang and Shen were reported to the police station and arrested. Now, the temple officials have hired lawyer Yu Chengmei to draft a complaint and sue in court.</p>

<p>The Department of Civil Affairs believes that the 12th and 13th teams of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Third District are extremely corrupt, so it secretly ordered Zheng Yitong, the Nantong District Security Commander, to inspect the two teams in Nantong. The security team surrounded the Xiaoying barracks in the west of the city and ordered them to surrender their weapons. All the arms and ammunition were temporarily kept by the platoon leader training class of the Nantong District Security Team. The surrendered officers and soldiers were housed in the Jinling Ningshao Guild Hall, pending selection and retention of the strong, and dismissal of the weak. The remaining officers and soldiers were paid off and sent back to their hometowns. The name of the 13th team was abolished, and Wu Yanjie was appointed as the captain of the 12th team to train unarmed police in Tongzhou.</p>

<p>Wang Peishen, a wealthy kiln owner in the Podiexiegang area of the town of Xiadianmiao, had been coveted by lake bandits for a long time. His two brothers had been separated for a long time, so the bandits set their sights on Wang. Late at night a few days ago, two black awning boats carrying over 20 lake bandits speaking different dialects arrived in the harbor, broke down the front door, searched for Wang Peishen but failed to find him, and kidnapped Wang Peishen's wife, Li, and her young child, using hemp ropes to tie them up. At the same time, they robbed the rooms of Wang's two brothers, taking away all the valuable clothing. Wang Peishen's self-defense pistol was also taken by the bandits. The Xiadianmiao town security team, known for its bravery, heard the alarm and opened fire. The two sides began to fight fiercely for about an hour. The security team fired over 200 rounds. The bandits were overwhelmed and tried to escape. The 7th squadron of the water police happened to be chasing from Xitang in a shallow-water gunboat. The county government also sent a police brigade and basic team on the Xinming ship to encircle and suppress them via Ganyao. The bandits abandoned their loot and fled.</p>

<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the signing of a draft agreement between Japan and Russia regarding the illegal sale of Dongtie (Chinese Eastern Railway), the local Sino-Russian Daosheng Bank immediately filed a lawsuit requesting the court to execute a provisional disposition. After receiving the petition, the court held a hearing yesterday afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation Process</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, the Nanshi Local Court formally accepted Daosheng Bank's request for provisional disposition of Dongtie's property in Shanghai, specifically the Pudong Wharf case. Judge Yao Fucheng opened the first civil court and summoned both parties to the court for an informal investigation. The plaintiff's attorneys, Yao Yongli, Yang Ruinian, and the American attorney Xu Li, all appeared in court. However, the defendant's side did not appear because the notification had not been delivered. Judge Yao asked about the detailed circumstances and then adjourned the hearing to a later date, summoning both parties for a formal investigation. The court adjourned at 2:45 PM. The Yangjiadu Wharf and Warehouses of the Dongtie.</p>
<p>Talks with Russian Advisor</p>
<p>According to Yavadersky, the legal advisor to the liquidation office of Daosheng Bank, he believes that the seizure is highly likely from a legal standpoint. The rights and interests of the Dongtie issue are not a problem for Japan, because when Japan held illegal sale negotiations in Tokyo, it repeatedly stated that the purchase of the railway was unrelated to Japan and that only China, Russia, and Daosheng Bank had the right to decide its future. The construction of the railway was due to the five million ruble capital of Daosheng Bank, and the Qing imperial court of China provided five million taels of treasury silver to Daosheng Bank.</p>

<p>Awaiting Approval from the Ministry of Finance to Shanghai, the Subcommittee Will Convene to Study</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that regarding the issue of organizing a five million industrial and commercial credit loan, the Qianye Gonghui (Money Trade Association) has indicated that it will expand lending to the best of its ability and not participate in the banking syndicate. The banking syndicate organization will change its policy. The Banking Association subcommittee meeting must wait for the Ministry of Finance's approval of the case before convening a meeting to decide everything. The details learned by the Xinxin News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<p>The Banking Sector Decides to Continue</p>
<p>The five million yuan industrial and commercial credit loan, according to the original opinions of all parties, would be undertaken by the government for 2.5 million, the banking sector for 1.25 million, and the Qianye sector for 1.25 million. The three parties would jointly form a banking syndicate to handle the loan matters. Now that the Qianye sector has indicated that it will not participate in the banking syndicate, all sectors are paying close attention to whether the syndicate organization will change its policy. According to news from the banking sector, it is believed that the syndicate organization originally intended to proceed jointly by the three parties. Now that one party is unwilling to participate, the other two parties can still continue. This measure is for relief and also a duty that the financial sector should fulfill.</p>
<p>The Subcommittee Postpones the Meeting</p>
<p>The subcommittee organized by the Banking Association is entirely for the study of industrial and commercial credit loans. Regarding its meeting date, according to Lin Kanghou, the Secretary-General of the Banking Association, the subcommittee originally intended to convene a meeting to study the matter immediately. Now, because the Qianye sector has indicated that it will not participate and the banking syndicate organization should be changed, it must wait for the Ministry of Finance's approval of the case to Shanghai before scheduling a meeting to study the progress.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Replies to the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting a revision of water and electricity rates to ease the burden on residents. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Municipal Council stating: "In reply to your letter of February 12th regarding the revision of water and electricity rates, the water rates were last implemented on April 1st of last year with an 80% discount for a period of one year. Now that the time limit has expired, the matter is under review. The increase in electricity prices is not purely due to the increase in coal prices, but is related to the increase in labor, warehouse goods, and other prices. Since the last revision of prices, prices have generally increased, and coal prices should only be considered as one of the elements. According to the items listed in the contract with the power company, if the circumstances for reducing prices are realized, the price will be reduced accordingly. This is a special reply."</p>

<p>Set to Sail to Shanghai Soon - Polish Goods Exhibition Ship Coming to the Far East</p>
<p>The Dar Pomorza, a school ship belonging to the Polish government's naval academy, carrying 66 students studying navigation and maritime commerce, and 41 crew members and professors, departed from Gdynia last September on a round-the-world voyage. It is now learned that the ship arrived in Yokohama, Japan, at the end of last month, and is currently docked in Nagasaki for repairs. It is expected to sail to Shanghai soon. Since it relies entirely on wind power, the exact date of arrival in Shanghai cannot be predicted. If there are no special winds or obstacles at sea, it may arrive by the end of this month, otherwise it may have to wait until the beginning of next month. The Polish community in Shanghai is preparing a grand welcome, and the Chinese government has designated the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Wusong Merchant Marine School to be responsible for the reception. In addition, Poland's total import volume for foreign trade last year was 79.7 million Polish zlotys, and its export volume was 97.5 million Polish zlotys, resulting in a surplus of 17.8 million Polish zlotys, an increase of 4.6 million Polish zlotys compared to the surplus of 13.3 million Polish zlotys in 1933. Overseas trade, such as with China, the United Kingdom, and Japan, has made considerable progress. Therefore, in order to develop overseas commerce, there are plans to establish consulates in important commercial ports such as China, Japan, and India. At the same time, two Polish goods exhibition ships will be sent to the United States and the Far East. The one sailing to the United States is the "Irmgard" and the one sailing to the East is the "Dadaros." The "Dadaros" exhibition ship is fully loaded with 10,000 tons of Polish goods. It departed from Gdynia, Poland, at the end of January and, after passing through Port Said, Penang, Suez, Singapore, and Hong Kong, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on April 20th.

<p>A Letter to the Banking Association Requesting Consistent Implementation - Also a Letter to the Silk and Satin Industry Association</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association created commercial acceptance drafts with the aim of reducing the account period and increasing currency utilization, the public has paid close attention to this issue. After receiving the association's letter requesting discounts upon implementation, the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank convened a meeting of important officials and decided to first promote and provide discounts as much as possible in accordance with regulations, and is planning convenient and simple discount procedures for these drafts. At the same time, it is believed that once these drafts are circulated, because they are indeed in line with the current needs of industry and commerce, it is expected that various industries will follow the silk and satin industry and imitate them. The relationship with the business of various banks in Shanghai will also become increasingly practical. Therefore, the bank suggested that the Shanghai Banking Association discuss this matter when it convenes a meeting in order to gather ideas and benefit the public, so that these notes can be easily promoted and the discount system can be perfected. It is heard that the Banking Association, according to the Silk Industry Bank's letter, established a subcommittee yesterday and appointed nine banks, including China, Communications, Shanghai, Guohua, Silk, and Xinhua, to formulate detailed implementation measures. It is expected that the circulation of these commercial notes will become more widespread day by day. The original letters from the Silk Industry Bank to the Banking Association and the reply to the Silk and Satin Industry Association are copied below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Banking Association</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, we have received your letter of March 8th stating that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's letter regarding the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association's creation of commercial acceptance drafts was forwarded to the banks in the association for review. We have also received a separate letter from the association stating that the association has resolved to create commercial acceptance drafts at a temporary members' meeting, with the aim of reducing the account period and increasing currency utilization. The benefits of its application are that the seller has a definite period for short-term collection of the goods, and can also hold it to banks and money shops for discounting. The buyer pays on schedule without any preparation. For banks and money shops, this acceptance draft is jointly responsible by the issuer and the acceptor, and the term is not long. If discounting is accepted, it is more secure and reliable than credit lending. It has a safe way to grow profits and can support the development of industry and commerce. Your association is known to be an up-and-coming force in the banking sector, paying attention to financial regulation and social services, and our silk and satin industry benefits even more because of business relationships. Therefore, the establishment has grown rapidly in just a few years, and its reputation is growing. It is also timely to take the lead and create new achievements, and industry and commerce are benefiting greatly. The commercial acceptance draft created by our colleagues is in line with your association's usual purpose and is expected to be supported. We hope that you will take the lead in allowing discounts when implemented to benefit industry and commerce. Commercial bills have been in use in various countries for a long time, so the discounting business has developed accordingly, and the discounting market should be established in response. Now that the association has created the aforementioned drafts, it is indeed in line with the current needs of industry and commerce. It is expected that various industries will follow suit, and its function to indirectly promote banking business is worth supporting. Our bank is approving the methods for accepting discounts. Once it is settled, we will send a special letter to inform the association. However, political matters are important, and we hope that your association will raise it for discussion when convening a meeting, so that we can gather ideas and benefit the public, and the implementation will be more helpful. It is expected that this discounting system will become more perfect, and fellow industries can also benefit a lot in business."</p>
<p>Reply to the Silk Industry Association</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, we have received your letter stating that your association has resolved to create commercial acceptance drafts in accordance with the bill law at a temporary members' meeting, with the aim of reducing the account period and increasing currency utilization, which is the same as our bank's usual purpose of serving society. We intend to negotiate discounts when implemented in order to facilitate circulation. At this time of industrial and commercial depression, the circulation of this bill is a unique and effective policy for increasing leverage, regulating finance, and restoring all industries. We are in awe of your association's leaders who initiated the compass for merchants to prescribe the right medicine. The bank originally aimed to regulate surpluses and deficits, and circulation is its responsibility. For this commercial acceptance draft, it should be supported and promoted. If your colleagues implement it on schedule, our bank will accept discounts as much as possible in line with its usual purpose of service to facilitate elegant life. As for the discount procedures, our bank is planning convenient and simple methods in order to make promotion easier. Moreover, commercial bills have been in use in various countries for a long time, and the discounting business has also developed accordingly. The discounting market has emerged in response. Now, the drafts created by your association are in line with the world trend and the current needs of industry and commerce. It is expected that various industries will follow suit, which requires the cooperation of the entire financial industry to achieve its full success and achieve its great effect. Therefore, in addition to accepting your association's commission to discount this bill as much as possible in accordance with regulations, we have already asked the Shanghai Banking Association to raise it for discussion when convening a meeting to formulate a detailed plan, so that this bill will be more easily promoted, the discount system will become more perfect, and the national economy will benefit from it. Is it only one industry that benefits from it? This is a special reply, and I hope you will consider it."</p>

<h3 id="e136">White Russian Panic in the French Concession: Activities of Soviet Russian Secret Agents <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>When the Russian ship "Northern," carrying Ambassador Yan and Mei Lanfang, etc., to Vladivostok, arrived in Shanghai, a foreign doctor on board, Mr. Tai Miduweizhi, and a mechanic, Mr. Daweidufu, fled the ship. Mr. Tai has been taken in by the White Russian Union in Shanghai, but Mr. Da has been missing since. On Friday, around 5:00 PM, two Russian youths went to the photo studio opened by a White Russian named Beierjin at 999 Avenue Joffre to request the negatives of portraits of Mr. Tai and Mr. Da. The two youths claimed to be detectives from the French police. Mr. Bei was alone in the studio at the time and asked for proof of their investigation. The two claimed it was at home and they would bring it the next day. Mr. Bei replied that he would give them the negatives the next day. One of the two youths then asked Mr. Bei to take a photo of him. As Mr. Bei was looking through the camera viewfinder, the other youth struck Mr. Bei on the head with a weight, knocking him unconscious. The two youths then left. Ten minutes later, a visitor discovered him and rushed him to the Russian hospital for treatment. Since this incident, the White Russian community in this port has been in a state of panic, fearing that Soviet Russian secret agents are operating in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Chamber of Commerce Informs the Public Security Bureau Regarding Lost Pawn Tickets and Affixing Stamps: Old Books Need Not Be Restamped Unless Continued in Use <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau explaining the responsibility for affixing stamps to lost pawn tickets. The letter states that lost pawn tickets and pawn receipts are documents issued by pawnshops to pawners to protect their rights. According to the provisional regulations on stamp tax, the responsibility for affixing stamps lies with the pawner who issued the document. For example, if a shop fails to affix a stamp to an invoice, the person who issued and received the invoice will be fined. The pawnshop should not be held responsible for the pawner's fault. Regarding account book stamps, according to the regulations, a stamp worth one dime should be affixed to each book each year. If a new book is used in the following year and the old book is not continued, then there is no need to affix additional stamps to the old book. This is the natural interpretation of the regulations and has been the practice for many years. Whether the old book from the previous year is continued in use depends on whether new accounts are added to it. Each pawnshop's book is a volume per month and has a starting and ending point. The serial numbers have long been assigned. Therefore, the new accounts in the following year will not be connected to the old book from the previous year. All of this is clear to anyone who understands accounting and business practices. Placing old accounts on the desk or in the account box is for the same purpose: for reference. There is no law requiring additional stamps to be affixed to old accounts when they are inspected. The public association's statement is alarming. Except for one account book with a missing stamp, which should be sent to the court for punishment by your bureau according to regulations, the remaining six account books with sufficient stamps, as well as the nine pawn tickets and one pawn receipt, should be returned to us to maintain fairness and to inform the inspectors to handle the matter carefully in the future. This is our earnest request.</p>
<h3 id="e138">YMCA 35th Anniversary Celebration Highlights <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's 35th-anniversary celebration, including all preparations and order, has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the anniversary celebration was held in the YMCA auditorium at Ba Xian Qiao. The auditorium was well-arranged and very solemn. The Chinese and foreign guests who attended included Minister Kong Xiangxi, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Minister Gu Weijun, Li Zhaokun, Zhao Jinqing, Li Dachao, Xu Xinliu, Hao Gengsheng, Cao Yunxiang, Pei Zhenyong, Dong Kechang, Cui Tongyue, Kuang Fuzhuo, Li Yuanxin, Zheng Qingcheng, Wang Chengzhi, Shi Zhaoyi, Liang Xiaochu, Fei Wusheng, Bao Naide, and more than 700 others. After signing their names, the guests were presented with a commemorative booklet by the receptionists and led into the auditorium. The meeting began at 3:00 PM and ended at 5:00 PM. Excerpts from the speeches are recorded below. At noon today, the YMCA held the opening ceremony of the 35th fundraising campaign. The YMCA invited more than 500 team leaders and members from each team, and the event was even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Sun Zhesheng's Speech</p>
<p>Li Zhaohuan delivered a speech on behalf of President Sun Zhesheng, saying that President Sun went to Hangzhou on official business today and could not attend. He was ordered to deliver the speech on his behalf and was also entrusted by the National YMCA to deliver congratulations. (According to Li, he is currently the president of the National YMCA.) The Shanghai YMCA has been established for 35 years since its founding, which coincided with the beginning of the 20th century. Therefore, it can also be regarded as a Christian organization born in the 20th century. It is also a religious, educational, and social organization. It not only enhances the morals, studies, improves the lives, and exercises the physique of its members, but also seeks happiness and improvement for the entire society of Shanghai, China, and the world. Because the YMCA is a Christian organization, it is based on the spirit of reverence for God and love for others. It not only seeks the interests of its members. When the Shanghai YMCA was founded, there were only two small houses and forty to fifty members. Today, after 35 years, it has expanded to various association locations on Sichuan Road, Ba Xian Qiao, West Shanghai, Pudong, and the city center, with the number of members increasing to three to four thousand. This kind of development from small to large and from low to high is due to the spirit of Jesus' love for others. The prosperity and expansion of an organization depend entirely on its service capacity and spirit. The Shanghai YMCA has already achieved today's results, and it is hoped that it will develop further in the future. Members and responsible personnel must identify goals and work harder to improve the health, knowledge of the youth in our country's organizations and the nation under oppression. At the same time, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide guidance and assistance in terms of talent and economy. Then, the future development of our association will have greater progress.</p>
<p>Gu Shaochuan's Speech</p>
<p>The topic I am talking about today is "The YMCA and International Justice." In the current world situation, I am afraid everyone will doubt whether there is any justice in the world, but I believe there is indeed justice in the international community. For example, when the League of Nations discussed the Northeast issue, many national representatives expressed their displeasure. It can be seen that there is still right and wrong in the world. However, on the one hand, our country must talk about self-defense and self-rescue, and on the other hand, it must instill the idea of justice into the world. This mission rests on the youth of the future. Speaking of youth, we must talk about the YMCA. I think the YMCA usually pays attention to the equal emphasis on the four educations, creating a sound personality. Only with personality can there be a sense of justice, can justice be promoted. Today, I congratulate the success of the Shanghai YMCA. On the one hand, I hope that the YMCA will promote justice. Ten years later, when the YMCA is celebrating its 45th anniversary, 55th anniversary, and 70th anniversary, justice will be promoted all over the world.</p>
<p>Secretary-General's Speech</p>
<p>The association's secretary-general, Mu Ganchen, reported that today is the 35th anniversary of the association's founding. Colleagues and others are holding a commemorative meeting to review the past and encourage the future. We are honored to have people from all walks of life attend. The members of our association are very grateful. Regarding the past history of our association, it is not possible to mention everything in a short time. Fortunately, there is a commemorative booklet for reference. In summary, this association was founded in 1900 (the 25th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty) by Mr. Yan Junren, Mr. Huang Zuoting, Mr. Wang Gechen, Mr. Cao Xuegeng, Mr. Lu Yisi, and other gentlemen. At the beginning of the establishment, the association only had a few rented houses in the city, and there were only dozens of members. Now there are two association locations on Ba Xian Qiao and Sichuan Road, as well as two branch locations in Pudong and West Shanghai, with thousands of members. This is really due to people from all walks of life and the members of the association understanding the purpose of this association and providing cooperation and support. As for the causes promoted by the association over the years, such as physical education, popular education, civic education, religious education, scientific lectures, model new villages, health campaigns, labor and rural services, and student movements, etc., all are designed to meet the needs of the times and to achieve the association's goal of guiding young people and promoting society. However, these are all methods of service. I think that the YMCA's contribution to the country and society lies in the following aspects: (1) Instilling the concept of a healthy personality, (2) Promoting cooperation throughout society, (3) Establishing a moral force to resist social evils, (4) Promoting youth movements.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Shanghai Industrial Trust Society to Take Over Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach and Expand It According to Plan <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach is a natural sandy beach, vast and boundless, with flat terrain and water levels of varying depths, making it a natural place for sea bathing and swimming. Since the Seaside Hotel leased and operated it, many people have gone there every summer. However, the hotel is limited by its finances, and it is difficult to achieve perfect facilities. Therefore, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Society will take it over this year and run it municipally. Inquiring about various situations, they are recorded below:</p>
<p>Preparing Funds to Take Over</p>
<p>The Gaoqiao Seaside Hotel has been leased and operated for several years. Although there were few visitors at first, the investment in facilities has exceeded tens of thousands. Although the business has recently developed gradually, the shareholders do not intend to continue operating it because the expansion of facilities is beyond their ability. Therefore, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Society has prepared funds to take it over. The two parties have reached an agreement through negotiations, and the society will expand it.</p>
<p>Planning Expansion</p>
<p>According to news obtained from the society, the society will focus on the following points when expanding and reorganizing the seaside bathing beach: (1) Reorganize the sandy beach, flatten the fine sand, and sift out the stones; (2) Build a large-scale cafeteria, selling Chinese food, snacks, cold drinks, etc.; (3) Build rain showers, changing rooms, and rent out high-quality bathing suits; (4) Plant flowers and trees extensively and set up wisteria trellises; (5) Provide遊boats and small boats for tourists to use. The above projects are estimated to cost 50,000 to 60,000.</p>

<p>The Municipal Shanghai Hospital on Duojia Road in Nanshi recently added the latest X-ray equipment and hired Dr. Shen Chengwu, an X-ray expert with a medical doctorate from the University of Vienna in Austria, to specialize in this field. In the future, he will make many contributions to the diagnosis of diseases and the inspection of pathology. The fees are very fair and reasonable. General inspections range from 5 yuan to 25 yuan, which is lower than any other medical institution. The poor and sick will be provided with more convenience.</p>

<p>Open from 9:30 AM Every Day; Open as Usual on Mondays to Read Newspapers</p>
<p>The purpose of the Shen Bao Circulation Library was originally to be a circulation library. Later, at the request of the guardians, a reading room was opened next to the lending desk to read books, magazines, and newspapers. The library currently displays more than 180 kinds of relatively advanced magazines, more than 40 kinds of newspapers, and various magazine compilations. You can take them out and read them at will. The average number of readers per day has reached more than 450 people. It is open every morning and closes at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. It is closed one day on Monday. Recently, some readers proposed on the library's bulletin board that it should be open from 9:00 AM in the morning and that it should not be closed on Mondays. Now, in order to respect the readers' opinions, the library's board of directors has decided that it will be open from 9:30 AM every morning, and the closing time in the afternoon will remain the same. It will be open on Mondays during the regular hours so that readers will not be interrupted from reading newspapers every day. However, due to time constraints, there are fewer books and magazines. It will still not be lent out or read on Mondays. This decision will be implemented starting this Monday.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Drug Manufacturing Facility Cracked Down on at Bazilu <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Second Landlord of the House Is Japanese; Whether Everyone Is Arrested Is Unknown</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, the Chinese Superintendent of the General Inspectorate, and Song Bingzheng, the detective, learned that there was a large-scale drug manufacturing facility for heroin on the upper floor of a four-story Western-style building at 45, Lane 512, Bazilu. They issued Search Warrant No. 6134 to the First Special District Court and went secretly with West Detective Pullat at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday. It was found that the second landlord of the house was a Japanese named Yi Yaxi who rented it. The Japanese Police Department was notified to send a Japanese detective to enter the house together. It was learned that the drug manufacturing facility was on the fourth floor. Without making a sound, they calmly went up. It was already after 2:00 PM. The workers in the room were about to start working when they heard the news and fled in a hurry. Four local people, Ma Rongmei, Zhang Xiaodi, Hu Afa from Shaoxing, and Li Abao from Yangzhou, were arrested outside the door. Two barrels of heroin weighing 37 pounds, two large cans of raw materials weighing 19 pounds, and a package of crude materials weighing 3 pounds were seized and taken to the Hongkou Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Public Works Bureau detailed the previous situation and said that the house was said to have been sublet to a Chinese named Wang Dingru by the Japanese Yi. The defendants denied being workers in the facility at the police station, but when they were arrested, their hands were white. He requested that they be detained for further investigation. Although the large number of machines and objects in the manufacturing room were now guarded by Chinese and Japanese detectives and were not allowed to be moved, it would be best to ask the court to conduct an on-site inspection. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives presented the details of the case. When questioned, the defendants hesitated and denied working in the heroin manufacturing facility on the fourth floor. Judge Wu Zihan ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further clarification.</p>

<p>Two Foremen Tragically Drown; Customs Detains Xin Shuntai</p>
<p>The Linxing, a small steamer owned by the Songhu Maoxing Company, was sailing to the Yawosha sea off the Sancha Estuary of Wusong at 10:30 PM the day before yesterday (14th) to tow a timber boat from Fujian to Shanghai. At the same time, another small steamer, Xin Shuntai, also arrived. The two small steamers, competing for business, both accelerated and rushed to arrive first. When they were about to reach the timber boat, the Linxing was accidentally collided with by the Xin Shuntai. At the same time, the sea breeze was strong, and the Linxing immediately sank. Huang Helou, a 30-year-old foreman from Yiqiao, Zhejiang, drowned because he could not escape. His body has not yet been recovered. The other four sailors were fortunate enough to climb onto the timber boat and were rescued. After Zhang Huabang Customs learned of the incident, they boarded a customs small steamer and rushed to the scene of the accident to inspect it for a week. They then took the Xin Shuntai, which caused the accident, to Zhang Huabang and detained it. Meanwhile, Maoxing Company filed a report with the customs to negotiate with Xin Shuntai for compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e146">French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association Protests the Dong Wenli Case; Yesterday, a Letter Was Sent to the French Consul General for Investigation and Handling <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, regarding the case of merchant Dong Wenli being illegally searched by the French police and falsely accused of opening a gambling establishment, jointly petitioned the French Concession authorities the day before yesterday, but it has not been resolved for a month. At the same time, the Jiangtui Association in Shanghai also sent a letter to the association making the same request. The association sent a letter to the French Consul General (Badas) yesterday to negotiate on reasonable grounds. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency has recorded the original text below:</p>
<p>"Respectfully, according to a letter from various merchants with their seals, on the night of February 12 this year at 8:00 PM, a large number of French police officers went to Wang Shunxing Wood Shop at 206 Avenue Foch, claiming to be searching for gambling, and violently beat apprentices and arrested merchants, framing Dong Wenli. More than two weeks have passed, and there is still no solution. The public is panicked and restless. At the time of the incident, the merchants were outraged by what they heard and saw. They all believed that the police's search of shops was often based on rumors and anonymous letters. This kind of reckless action is enough to make residents unable to sleep peacefully. Since the case has been found to be unfounded, four merchants and one ignorant apprentice who were playing mahjong were arrested. Afterwards, they tried to frame Dong Wenli and monitor his actions. It was later heard that various groups came forward to negotiate, but there was no response. Their attempts to cover up their mistakes are even more obvious. Our stores are deeply chilled when we think of this. Therefore, we jointly affix our seals and petition your association to lodge a serious protest and send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French authorities seriously. At the same time, we ask the court that the concession police should apply to the court for a search warrant before searching residents in the future to show caution and avoid abuses, etc. We are currently reviewing the matter. The Jianghuai Association in Shanghai also sent a letter saying that the French police's illegal search and framing of our association member Dong Wenli was caused by the police inspector Qian Chenglong abusing his power and arbitrarily fabricating the case. Now that the truth has been clarified, we request that your association send a letter to the French authorities to investigate and handle the matter strictly to deter others and reassure the residents. Based on this, we respectfully report the case and ask you to investigate and handle it and reply to us so that we can inform you. Sincerely, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, to Mr. Badas, French Consul General in Shanghai."</p>

<p>At 8:00 PM the night before last (15th), Gao Huaibao, a barber shop owner from Yangzhou, invited guests to Qingpingyuan Restaurant at No. 7, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and West Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. He invited his fellow townsman Wang Jilong (37 years old), who lived at No. 62 Lagenal Road in the French Concession, to be the host. Halfway through the meal, Wang ordered the waiter Meng Xiangqing (31 years old, from Yangzhou, living at No. 64, Fengyuli, Saposai Road) to change two dishes according to the menu. Meng refused to change them. When Wang settled the bill at the end of the meal, Wang blamed Meng for refusing to change the dishes. The two then quarreled and were persuaded to stop. Wang went home immediately, and Meng went to work on the third floor. Unexpectedly, after the quarrel, he was overwhelmed with anger, his face turned pale gray, and he could not stand still and fell down. He immediately hired a car to send Meng to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital across the street from the Dashijie on Xizang Road for treatment. Unexpectedly, he died when he arrived at the hospital. His family reported to the French police, saying that he had died of anger after quarreling with the customer Wang Jilong and requested an investigation. The police officer approved the request and sent a detective to send the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall. One side brought Wang to the case. Yesterday, the police station summoned the deceased's mother, Meng Wangshi, and the witnesses Zhang Rongxi, the owner of Qingpingyuan, and Guo Honglin, another waiter, to the case. They reported to the Second Special Court Procuratorate and appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to come to the office with the forensic doctor, the clerk, etc., at noon to examine the body. The autopsy revealed that the deceased died of a relapse of old heart disease and that there was no other cause. After the autopsy, they took their seats in the court. First, West Detective Henry and Chinese Detective Zhang Chunsheng reported the investigation process. According to the deposition of the deceased's mother, Meng Wangshi, she said that the deceased was her son and had suffered from stomach problems before his death. Last night, he died of anger after a quarrel. The defendant Wang Jilong confessed that he had a slight quarrel with the deceased over changing dishes, but it was not fierce. The two were quickly persuaded to stop. According to the statements of the witnesses Zhang Rongxi, Guo Honglin, and the deceased's old man, Huang Huanwen, the official ruled that Meng Xiangqing died of illness during his lifetime, and the body was handed over to the deceased's relative, Meng Wangshi, for burial. Whether the defendant Wang Jilong was at fault will be investigated and handled by the police department.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Woman's Death from Quitting Opium <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Autopsy Reveals Death from Illness While Quitting Opium</p>
<p>Xie Xu, a 37-year-old woman from Pudong, lived with her husband, Xie Linkui (a tailor), at No. 307 Tongfu Road. She was physically weak and addicted to opium for seven or eight years. Recently, she suddenly felt that this was inconvenient and became disgusted with it. She then repeatedly asked someone to help her quit this addiction. On the 12th of this month, through the introduction of someone, she found Xu Yongshi (34 years old, from Tongzhou), a quack doctor living at No. 88 Robison Road, to help her quit. At that time, it was agreed that it would cost 45 yuan, and 20 yuan would be paid first. Then, Xu bought the medicine and ordered her to decoct and take it, stipulating that she should eat it every six hours, for a total of six times. After taking it, she would be able to quit. Unexpectedly, her illness suddenly became serious after taking the medicine for the fifth time, and she died before the day before yesterday. Her husband believed that his wife's death was caused by Xu, so he called Xu to his house and argued with him, saying that he would not settle the matter unless he paid 2,000 yuan. Then they quarreled and wrestled with each other to the Chengdu Road police station. After the police officer inquired about the situation, he ordered Detective Xie Guisheng and others to investigate. He then sent the body to the autopsy room on Pei Tou Road. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, and forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, the clerk, etc., came to the office to examine the body. Xie Linkui said that he was 43 years old and that the deceased was his wife. Recently, she wanted to quit smoking. Through the introduction of someone, she asked Xu to come, but after eating his medicine, she became ill and died. Therefore, he asked for justice. Xu Yongshi said that his opium-quitting medicine was a family secret recipe. He had given it to seven or eight people to decoct and take, and the results were good. He bought the medicine for her, which contained the medicine "wind eggplant flower," which would temporarily make people dizzy after eating, but it was not life-threatening. Judge Song then told the husband of the deceased that, according to the forensic doctor of our court, the cause of your wife's death was still illness. If you still have any doubts, our court can dissect the body for examination. However, he was unwilling. Judge Song then ruled that the deceased Xie Xu was a woman who died of illness while quitting opium. The body was handed over to her husband, Xie Linkui, for burial after he signed a statement.</p>

<p>Ding Hanzhang and Yang Defu Trade Accusations, but the Weapon Was Found at Ding's Place</p>
<p>Police officer Gu Luyan of the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, while on duty at the Dalin Road area outside Xiaoximen around 2 AM on December 10th of last year, was suddenly approached by two men who hurriedly reported that a girl had been abducted by bandits and was being held in a house at a certain address on Dalin Road. They requested that Officer Gu go immediately to rescue her. Officer Gu, believing them to be telling the truth, followed them to the entrance of Dalin Road. Suddenly, four thugs jumped out from the darkness at the roadside, grabbed Officer Gu around the waist, pinned him to the ground, and began beating him severely with fists and feet. Then they used two sharp axes to hack at Officer Gu's hands. At that time, Officer Gu was outnumbered and badly wounded in his right hand. His right thumb was completely severed, and his No. 7460, eight-inch Browning pistol was also snatched. Afterward, the authorities issued a general order to strictly apprehend the escaped bandits. On the 14th of this month, the French Concession Police arrested three bandits, Xu Fuyuan, Li Yutang, and Xu Delu. After interrogation, it was learned that the Xu bandits had committed multiple robbery cases in the Chinese territory. The Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team was immediately notified and officers were dispatched to bring them back for questioning. According to the Xu bandits, their accomplice, Ding Hanzhang (nicknamed "Little Pockmark"), was the main culprit who hacked Officer Gu and snatched his pistol. It was learned that Ding was hiding at No. 16 Hengzhenfang, Tangjiawan. The team dispatched a large number of personnel to secretly arrest Ding Hanzhang at that address around 7 AM yesterday morning. Two sharp axes and several iron rulers were found under his bed. He was brought back to the team, where Chief Lu interrogated him. Ding confessed that he was 25 years old and from Bao'ying. Earlier, because his friend Yang Defu and others had demanded expenses from a new construction site, Officer Gu Luyan of the Ximen Branch knew about it and went to forcibly stop them, causing Yang and Officer Gu to harbor deep resentment and hatch a plot to murder him. He then asked his friend "Little Yangzhou" and six others, including himself, to hide two sharp axes at the entrance of Dalin Road around 2 AM on December 10th of last year, lure Officer Gu to Datong Road, and hack at him with the axes. However, at that time, everyone was panicked and only saw Gu fall to the ground motionless, so they did not have time to check whether he was dead before scattering and fleeing. The pistol that was snatched at that time was also taken by Yang and the others. Yang is now hiding at No. 1, Zengrongli, Ailai Ge Road, in the French Concession. Officers were dispatched again, together with detectives from the French Police, to arrest Yang Defu. According to Yang, he is 25 years old and from Gaoyou. He used to run a noodle shop. Last year, because Ding Hanzhang's uncle stole one of my quilts and hid without showing his face, I argued with Ding many times, leading to a feud. Ding Hanzhang's arrest this time is simply a false accusation making me the main culprit in the case. He begged for a thorough investigation. Because the case was important, they were ordered to prepare a written report and send it to the Bureau for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Yao Jinping, Who Transformed from Female to Male, Has Arrived in Shanghai <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Her Vivid Account is Like a Fantasy; Witnesses and Evidence Suggest it is True; Worthy of Study by Physiologists</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: It was reported by Shenshi News Agency's Tianjin telegram on the 15th that Yao Youtang's daughter, an officer of Li Du's troops, suddenly underwent physiological changes upon hearing thunder and transformed into a male body. It was also said that the person had already left Beijing and come to Shanghai. The suddenness of the matter made it hard to believe as true. However, yesterday morning, a Datong News Agency reporter learned from General Li Du that this matter was indeed true and that the person had already arrived in Shanghai. After many turns, the reporter was able to meet the person and obtained two photos related to the matter, which made him believe that the world is full of wonders. The reporter records the situation below for the study of physiologists.</p>
<p>A Brief Account of Yao Jinping, Who Transformed from Female to Male</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a Datong News Agency reporter visited General Li Du and confirmed that the news was true. The reporter then went to her residence in the French Concession and met the protagonist of this female-to-male transformation, Yao Jinping (not Jinbing), who is from Zhongjie, Qingxian County, Hebei. She is 20 years old this year. Her father, Yao Huating (Youtang is his alias), studied at the Baoding Military Academy. During Zhang Zongchang's rule in Shandong, he served as a staff officer in Yao Yunke's Eighth Division. Later, he went to Jilin to serve as the captain of the police academy. After the September 18th Incident, he joined Li Du's Volunteer Army and served as the chief of staff of the First Division of the Jilin Self-Defense Army.</p>
<p>Transformation upon Hearing Thunder</p>
<p>Because of the defeat in the war of resistance, he retreated with the army into Russian territory. After detouring to Xinjiang, there was no news of him, and his fate was unknown. Therefore, Jinping, at her home, missed her father so much that she cried day and night. The transformation from female to male also occurred in this way. According to Yao Qingpu (Yao Jinping's grandfather, who accompanied Jinping to Shanghai this time), on the evening of the 21st day of the seventh lunar month of last year, Jinping was lying on her bed in the small building, thinking sadly of her father, when she heard a loud thunder. The roof tiles of the small building shook. At that time, Jinping immediately felt something. The next day, she shyly told her mother, Mrs. Zhang, that she had transformed into a man. Her mother thought it was a joke and tried to feel through her trousers, and indeed felt something extra.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Dignified Man</p>
<p>At that time, the whole family was extremely surprised. According to the woman, in a dream that night, an old woman said to her, "You have transformed into a male body. From now on, you can look for your father and fulfill your wish. However, you must wait a hundred days before you can show your lower body to others, otherwise it will not be auspicious." After a full hundred days, the family took off her pants and examined her, and indeed, she was a dignified man. The above is all from the talk of her grandfather Yao Qingpu. Given his old age and simplicity, he would not deceive us. However, the matter is indeed somewhat akin to a fantasy.</p>
<p>Documents Proving the Facts</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the reporter personally saw Yao Jinping. Although she was no different from an ordinary man, she was quite shy when meeting people. She seemed to have bound her feet as a child, so she still showed signs of bent feet. The pierced earring holes had not disappeared. This is where she differs from ordinary men. Her grandfather Yao Qingpu also showed the reporter one photo of her before the transformation and one after the transformation, which seemed to prove that the matter was not false. At the same time, there was also a diploma from the girls' school she attended in her hometown in 1929, which is recorded below. Her grandfather Yao Qingpu also said that before leaving Tianjin, they stayed at the Qi family in Dongjia Hutong, Xiaoguan, Hebei. When they talked about this matter, the neighbors were in an uproar. The police also sent officers to investigate, which was very troublesome. Therefore, he asked the reporter not to announce the location of their Shanghai residence.</p>
<p>Joining the Army to Find Her Father, Li Persuaded Her Not To</p>
<p>Since transforming into a male body, Yao Jinping has changed her name to Yao Zhen and her style name to Gengsheng. She arrived in Shanghai on the 8th of this month and visited General Li Du and his wife. Regarding joining the army to find her father, Li advised her not to because she was young and her parents were old. The reporter now records her girls' school graduation diploma below: "Certificate of Completion: Student Yao Jinping is from Qingxian County, Hebei Province, is 15 years old this year, and has completed the four-year course at this school. Her examination results are passing. This certifies. Yao Zhengqian, Principal of the Qingxian Public Zhongjie Girls' Elementary School, July 2nd, Republic of China 19."</p>

<h3 id="e151">The Dispute Between Zhou Defang and His Wife <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Judge's Firm Persuasion is Ineffective</p>
<p>The Wife Wants Separate Living and Alimony; the Husband's Condition of Disease Awaits Examination</p>
<p>Zhou Defang, the second son of Zhou Bingchen, the former owner of the Sanxing Stage, was recently sued by his wife, Ge Lijun, in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering separation from Zhou and payment of alimony of 50,000 yuan. The reason is that Zhou wanders outside all day and associates with prostitutes such as Fang Qing, Lao Jiu, and Xiao Yun, resulting in the transmission of venereal diseases and frequent abuse. The First Special Court had summoned the parties for questioning before. This newspaper has already reported on the matter. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Qinglan continued the trial in the Fourth Civil Court. Zhou Defang continued to retain lawyer Yuan Yang'an to defend him. The court first advised them to reconcile. The plaintiff, Ge Lijun, stated that cohabitation was impossible and only agreed to set up a small family outside and receive 100 yuan per month from Zhou for living expenses. Zhou Defang stated that his father's business had failed and that he had no occupation himself. How could he afford this 100 yuan per month? Separation would also increase expenses, which he could not agree to. He demanded to live with the plaintiff. Judge Zhang repeatedly enlightened and persuaded them, but the opinions of both parties could not be reconciled, resulting in no possibility of reconciliation. Judge Zhang then proceeded with the trial. According to the plaintiff, the defendant's venereal disease was white turbidness, which he contracted from the prostitute Xiao Yun in Qunyu Lane in the winter of the year before last. In July of last year, she was also infected and later cured by Dr. Zhong Shuzhen. The rest of her testimony was similar to that given during the previous court hearing. Zhou Defang completely denied all the points made by the plaintiff. Judge Zhang repeatedly advised them to reconcile, but both parties insisted on their views and refused to back down, resulting in no settlement. The court stated that the case required investigation and adjourned the hearing to the 23rd, ordering Zhou Defang to go to the forensic room of the court on Monday morning for examination.</p>

<p>Route 4</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to develop traffic in southern Shanghai, plans to open new routes 4 and 5. The stations and fares for Route 4 have been determined, with Dapu Bridge as the terminus. After the incense season, all the new vehicles will be used on this route. As for the cross-city route 5, the road surface is uneven and is being paved by the Public Works Bureau. Therefore, the official implementation date has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Zhang Guanghua's Appeal Trial Opens <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, a Henan native living in the pavilion room on the third floor of No. 24 Chongdefang, Minguo Road, in the French Concession, lived with his younger brother, Zhang Guangzhou. Guanghua worked at the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, and Guangzhou was still studying, tutored by Nai Shi. On November 22nd of last year, Guanghua resigned from his position at the Shipping Administration Bureau and was preparing to pack his luggage to return to his department. That night, his younger brother Guangzhou was suddenly slashed in the neck and died tragically. Guanghua was also slashed in the head. The police sent Guanghua to the hospital for treatment. Guangzhou's body was reported to the court for inspection and was buried by the benevolent hall. After Guanghua recovered, he was brought back by the police for investigation. It was then learned that the tragedy occurred because the deceased held a knife to kill his older brother. The brother seized the knife and killed his younger brother. Therefore, Zhang Guanghua was prosecuted by the Second Special Court on charges of murder. Judge Xiong Huicui held several court hearings to summon witnesses and study the case, and personally went to the scene of the incident for investigation. At the end of the trial, Zhang Guanghua was convicted of murder and sentenced to five years in prison. The knife was confiscated. The details have been reported repeatedly in previous newspapers. Now Zhang Guanghua has filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court, based on the petition, summoned the witnesses yesterday morning by Judge Fan Peien: the landlady Dai Chen, Yan Jintao who lived with Zhang in the pavilion room on the second floor, and Shan Bingchang and Lin Shenxiang (the two who were the first to go out to call for help), relatives of the landlady who lived on the mezzanine, as well as police officer No. 455, Bao Tan, and others. The appellant Zhang Guanghua was brought back, and a special investigation court hearing was held. Zhang still maintained his previous statement, that he felt someone砍 him on the head first in the dark, and then砍 his younger brother. Because he couldn't open the door, he jumped out of the window and shouted for help, and so on. The testimony of the witnesses was also the same as their testimony during the first trial. The court verified the testimony and then adjourned the trial. The appellant was still returned to the detention center, and the others left to await further notice.</p>

<p>Xie Yin, a young woman from Zhenjiang, is 27 years old and lives at No. 202 Songxue Street in the city. Her husband returned to his hometown due to business, and before leaving, he instructed his wife that his friend Monk Zhuang (34 years old, from Zhenjiang, lives at No. 1 Yongheli, Qinglian Street, and makes shoes, and often stayed at Xie's home) must not stay at our home. Unexpectedly, after her husband left, Monk Zhuang still requested to stay. To avoid suspicion, Xie sternly refused. Who knew that at 1:20 AM yesterday morning, Zhuang actually moved bedding and so on to Xie's home. Although Xie repeatedly refused, Zhuang playfully jumped onto Xie's bed and demanded that Xie sleep with him. Xie was terrified and shouted for help to drive him away. Zhuang then forcibly covered Xie's mouth and attempted rape. Xie resisted vigorously and was not defiled. Zhuang forced Xie to agree to a marriage date and said that the wedding invitation had been printed and sent out many, but Xie snatched one (the original invitation cover had 〇〇 first, and the inside said "Ashamed to marry neighbor Yin's daughter on the 19th of this month, humbly request your presence, Zhuang the Monk invites"), fortunately, Zhang Deru, the watchman of No. 30 who lived with them, arrived and took Zhuang and Xie Yin to the police station for investigation. After questioning by Chief Shen, the plaintiff Xie confessed to the above, and presented the invitation as evidence. The defendant Zhuang each confessed that Xie Yin 呌 him to sleep together at night and was not raped. It was deemed that Monk Zhuang printed red invitations privately, harming Xie Yin's reputation and family, and was sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>What is their marital relationship? Transferred to the Court for Questioning</p>
<p>Wang Hua, a woman from Danyang, 40 years old, was holding a note at 1:20 PM yesterday and asked Chen Fangcheng, the 9th watchman stationed at the Yimiao Police Station on Zhonghua Road, for directions. As Officer Chen was taking the note to look at it, a young man suddenly reached out and snatched the paper, immediately tearing it up, saying, "I'll take you to collect it!" Wang Hua negotiated with the young man, "You tore up my two hundred yuan check, you must compensate me." They argued endlessly. The police asked if she knew the young man. She replied that she did not know him. The police deemed the case bizarre and brought them both to the station for questioning. After questioning by Chief Liu, Wang Hua confessed to the above. She pieced together the torn pieces and it was not a check. The defendant, named Lin Chongfang, 18 years old, from Yongtai Guiyuan Store, Lihongqiao, Fujian, said that because there was a marital relationship, he had been involved in litigation in the court that had not yet been decided. The case was related to the court and a judgement was sent to the court for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e158">A Record of the Interrogation of the Songjiang Fire Brigade Committee for Arson and Destruction <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Former Suzhou Public Security Bureau Director Yin Shisheng opened the Songhui Amusement Park next to Songhui Automobile Road in his hometown of Songjiang last year. At that time, Li Ruizhi, Yao Chongfu, and other members of the Second District Fire Brigade of the county went to solicit monthly donations for the fire brigade. Yin refused to donate, and therefore they parted unhappily. On July 15th and 16th, Li, Yao, and others, while practicing firefighting, somehow destroyed the doors, windows, and utensils of the park, and moved Yin's beds, tents, boxes, and quilts to the patio and set them on fire. Afterwards, Yin sued through the Songjiang County Court and requested the Jiangsu High Court to transfer jurisdiction, designating the Shanghai District Court to handle the case. After inquiry by Prosecutor Kong Xianglin, Li Ruizhi, Yao Chongfu, and others were prosecuted for obstructing order and public danger, damage, and obstructing official duties. Judge Shao Qinzhi held a court hearing once, but it was not concluded because witnesses still needed to be summoned. It was decided to continue the hearing at a later date. It is now known that the plaintiff Yin Shisheng retained lawyer Cao Shuling to file a private prosecution, requesting to recover all the destroyed items, according to the actual value, totaling 18,447.66 yuan, to be compensated by the defendants, etc. The defendants Li Ruizhi and Yao Chongfu retained four lawyers, Jin Xiongbo, Gu Changyuan, Yu Chuan鼎, and Zhang Yinkui, to submit a defense. According to the cause of this case, the Songhui Amusement Park was destroyed by hooligans when the fire brigade of a district was testing the vehicle. At about 8:00 PM on that afternoon, there were more than 10,000 spectators in front of the Songhui Art Park. The spectators and the park threw bricks and stones at each other, resulting in the injury of several spectators. This aroused public anger, and then developed into the demolition of the wall and the entry into the park. One person shouted and everyone responded, leading to a riot. As for the destruction of the park and the burning of the fire truck, it is difficult to prove in the chaos. Yesterday morning, Judge Shao Qinzhi specially opened the third court to continue the trial. Both parties were accompanied by lawyers to the court. First, witness Zhu Yinhui, 39 years old, in the printing industry, testified. Asked whether he had mediated the case outside, he answered no. Next, witness patrol officer Wu Xisheng testified about the suppression process at the time. Finally, Yin Shisheng's wife Yin Zhu testified that in addition to the destroyed items, 2,626 yuan in cash, 580 yuan in silver, more than 3,000 silver coins, and 397,000 copper coins were lost in the cupboard, prepared for disaster relief in Shanghai the next day, were all lost. The presiding officer obtained the testimony, and because it was past noon, he ordered the lawyers and plaintiffs and defendants to schedule a continuation of the trial on the 23rd of this month at 10:00 AM. After the order was given, the court was adjourned.</p>

<p>Requesting the Owner to Extend the Deadline for Relocation</p>
<p>At the intersection of Yinghuali, Laobesheng Road in western Shanghai, there is vacant land of about twenty acres. Because the location is remote and there are few people, most residents from Jiangbei, unable to afford to rent houses, built thatched sheds on the vacant land to live in, totaling about four hundred and sixty rooms, housing more than two thousand four hundred people. Recently, because the landlord Qiasheng Company planned to sell the vacant land, it ordered all the shantytowns to be demolished within two weeks, otherwise, it would be enforced. The shantytowns were unable to relocate at once and demanded that the landlord relocate them at a preferential address, which was not approved. Instead, workers were ordered to build bamboo dams around the land to prevent entry and exit. The shantytowns were panicked. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, they sent representatives Zhu Guangyou, Yue Jisong, Yin Jiafu, Zhao Qike, and dozens of others, carrying petitions to the Municipal Party Department in Fenglin Bridge. Yu Yaoqiu, a staff member of the Investigation Section, received them. The representatives recounted their hardships and requested assistance to avoid displacement.

<p>According to a statement released by the Dyeing Industry Association, Changxing Mercerizing Dyeing Factory, located at No. 17 Ning'an Lane, Weining Road, South Shanghai, was established in the 16th year of the Republic of China by Wu Xinfu as a sole proprietorship. The initial capital was several thousand yuan, and due to business development over the years, the surplus is estimated to be over two hundred thousand yuan. Its success is remarkable and is a rare sight in the dyeing industry. However, the factory suddenly announced its closure in February of this year, claiming poor business performance, which angered all the workers. They reported the matter to the Dyeing Industry Union, which in turn reported it to the Party and government agencies for legal mediation and strictly ordered the employer to resume operations. The case is currently under investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, but no results have been achieved. To clarify whether the factory's annual business has been profitable or loss-making, the Party and government agencies will entrust an accountant to conduct a legal audit of the accounts and then mediate the matter. In the meantime, the labor side is ordered to await a resolution quietly.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor, upon reading the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 16th, the statement that "Japanese Buddhist scholars Kochimura Haruki and Shakushimoku Zen are staying at the Xuezi Branch Temple and were invited to Fenghua Xueshi by Taixu yesterday, and accompanied them there" is entirely untrue.

<p>(2) Non-Gold Standard Countries</p>
<p>The economic situation of non-gold standard countries in recent years includes the so-called gold sterling bloc (represented by the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, and Sweden), the U.S. dollar bloc (represented by the United States), and the Japanese yen bloc (represented by Japan). The common policy of these countries is to abandon the gold standard, devalue their currencies through inflation, increase national prices, and increase corporate profits to promote production and reduce unemployment. At the same time, they also encourage exports by lowering foreign exchange rates, which has gradually become effective. The financial, price, production, unemployment, bankruptcy, and trade conditions of these countries are described below.</p>
<p>(1) Finance: Generally speaking, the financial situation is gradually stabilizing and improving and is achieving the expected goals to some extent. Looking at the discount rate of central banks, it has generally been declining since 1932, which proves that the financial situation has become increasingly stable. Looking at the statistics of banknote issuance and cash reserves in various countries, the amount of banknotes issued last year decreased in the United States and Japan compared with 1933, except for a slight increase in the United Kingdom. And cash reserves have gradually increased. It can be seen that the main purpose of currency inflation is to devalue the currency, suppress the rate of increase, increase prices, and develop exports, not to issue banknotes indiscriminately.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the exchange rate, since 1931, the exchange rate of non-gold standard countries against France, a gold standard country, has consistently declined. The exchange rates between non-gold standard countries are affected by currency devaluation wars and other factors. In general, the exchange rate of the British pound against the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen has been increasing since 1932. In 1934, due to the U.S. gold and silver nationalization policy, the exchange rate of the British pound against the U.S. dollar increased from 4.218 U.S. dollars in 1933 to 5.040. The exchange rate of the British pound against the Japanese yen also increased this year compared to the previous year. Looking at the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, due to Japan's abandonment of the gold standard at the end of 1931, the exchange rate increased significantly in 1932 and 1933, putting Japan at a disadvantage in export trade competition. At the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen increased to two U.S. dimes for one Japanese yen. In March 1933, the U.S. abandoned the gold standard, and the exchange rate gradually decreased. By July of the same year, it had decreased to 2.8 U.S. dimes for one Japanese yen. After October, until May 1934, it decreased to three dimes due to the U.S. gold policy. Therefore, the average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen in 1934 was 0.2971 U.S. dollars, which was lower than 0.2565 U.S. dollars in 1923. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e174">The Causes and Consequences of March 17th <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Boliang</p>
<p>In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the surge of anger against the abolition of traditional Chinese medicine at the Health Committee meeting erupted. My colleagues in the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association (now the National Medicine Association) were the first to fight for it. Subsequently, at the request of medical groups across the country, we initiated the organization of a national conference of representatives of medical and pharmaceutical groups to seek a way to preserve ourselves. Therefore, in view of the poor environment for traditional Chinese medicine, medical groups in Shanghai jointly initiated and convened a national conference of representatives of medical and pharmaceutical groups in Shanghai. On March 17th, when the meeting was held, representatives from seventeen provinces traveled thousands of miles to participate in the discussions. We gathered together to seek unity, to make effective arguments with righteous appeals. Therefore, the resolution to ban Chinese medicine in the 19th year of the Republic of China was not implemented. Time flies, and eight years have passed in an instant. Our traditional Chinese medicine has resisted cultural and economic aggression from abroad and sought academic progress and theoretical innovation internally, gradually moving towards a scientific path. The numerous achievements are obvious to all. On the occasion of the emergence of the March 17th National Doctors' Day, I dare to solemnly inform my beloved 450 million compatriots that traditional Chinese medicine has protected the health of the people, preserved national essence, and promoted culture for thousands of years, which is not without merit. Moreover, our eastern neighbor Japan is still reviving Chinese herbal medicine, and Western countries are also exploring Chinese medicine. It can be seen that traditional Chinese medicine has its true value, which our people should recognize. I have one more word to say to all medical circles across the country: All academics regress if they do not advance, and the same is true for our medical and pharmaceutical circles. If we only seek temporary survival without striving for self-improvement, then things rot and worms grow, giving opponents an opportunity to take advantage. For the sake of serving society and preserving the glorious history of thousands of years, in accordance with the principle of survival of the fittest, the Chinese medicine community should conduct further and deeper research on Chinese medicine academics in order to achieve perfection and gain faith. We should also be vigilant about the conspiracies and strategies of those who oppose us and never succumb to them. Let all my fellow practitioners rise up. Then, the future of traditional Chinese medicine may be promising.</p>
<h3 id="e175">History of National Medicine <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shi'e</p>
<p>Chinese medicine originated with Emperor Yan Shennong. The "Huainanzi" records that Shennong tasted the flavors of hundreds of herbs and encountered seventy poisons in a single day, from which medicine emerged. It can be seen that there was no medicine before Shennong. Since Shennong ruled China, the suffering of the people began to rely on him for relief. However, at the beginning of its invention, medicine was extremely simple, relying on the properties of drugs to treat diseases, without knowing the organization of prescriptions, let alone the meaning of prescriptions. During the Shennong era, the medical techniques invented included not only drug treatment, but also Bianstone, moxibustion, nine needles, guidance, massage, and other methods, all due to differences in local weather, climate, customs, and diseases, so treatments varied with time, place, and disease. The "Inner Canon" says that diseases are treated differently in different places, all with the same result, because of the terrain. This is what it means.</p>
<p>For example, the eastern regions are all places of fish and salt, near the sea and water. Their people eat fish and like salt, and they are all comfortable in their places, enjoying their food. Fish makes people hot, and salt overcomes blood, so their people are all black and sparse-skinned, and their diseases are mostly hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are caused by blood heat, and the best treatment for blood heat is Bianstone. Bianstone is a stone needle, a kind of magnetic peak. The mountains of the Gao clan have stones like jade, which can be used as needles. This is Bianstone, so the treatment with Bianstone comes from the east.</p>
<p>The west is a land of gold and jade, a place of sand and stone. Their people live on hills and are often windy, and the water and soil are strong. Their people do not wear clothes but wear rough cloth, eat extravagantly, and are fat. Evil cannot harm their bodies, and their diseases arise from within. Their treatment is suitable for poisons, so the treatment with poisons comes from the west.</p>
<p>The north is high and hilly, with wind, cold, and ice. Their people enjoy living in the wild and eating milk, and their cold storage often causes full-body diseases. Their treatment is suitable for moxibustion, which is the use of artemisia moxa and fire to burn, so the treatment with moxibustion comes from the north.</p>
<p>The south is low-lying, with weak and humid soil, and a gathering place for mist and dew. Their people like sour foods and eat rotten things, so their people are all fine-skinned and red, and they suffer from numbness. Their treatment is most suitable for fine needles, so the treatment with nine needles comes from the south.</p>
<p>The central land is flat and humid, and its people eat a variety of foods and do not labor, so their diseases are often weakness, faintness, chills, and fever. Their treatment is suitable for guidance and massage, so the techniques of guidance and massage come from the center.</p>
<p>The five treatments of national medicine were all invented during the Shennong era. Since Xuanyuan Huangdi conquered the unrighteous with martial virtue and ruled China in place of Shennong, he gathered the heroes of the four directions and discussed them in the Mingtang. Qi Bo, Lei Gong, Bo Gao, and others freely debated, and the methods of diagnosing diseases, such as feeling the pulse, observing the color, listening to the sound, and asking questions, were greatly improved. The muscles, skin, tendons, bones, meridians, collaterals, viscera, Yingwei qi, and blood flow, the wells, springs, ying, yu, and combining points were all made clear, and the book "Inner Canon" was written, which is the ancestor of medical books.</p>
<p>The Shang minister Yi Yin, who assisted Tang and ruled the world, paid attention to the people's diseases and collected medical prescriptions widely, writing the book "Tangye Jing", which is the ancestor of medical prescription books.</p>
<p>Chunyu Yi, the Han Taicang public, responded to the call of Emperor Wen and treated various symptoms with his hands, listing twenty-four cases, and presented them to the court, becoming the ancestor of national medical case records.</p>
<p>The late teacher Zhang Zhongjing, during the reign of Emperor Ling of the Eastern Han Dynasty, lamented that doctors at the time each inherited family skills and did not seek to understand the classics. When encountering heatstroke, they arbitrarily treated with cold water, and for cold symptoms, they used fire to chase away warmth, resulting in successive deaths. The Zhang surname clan was usually large, but two-thirds of them died in ten years, with typhoid fever accounting for seven out of ten deaths. Grieving the loss of the past and lamenting the irredeemable death, he developed unique methods of treatment, distinguishing between the meridians and differentiating symptoms, clearly distinguishing between cold and heat, establishing 397 methods and compiling 113 formulas, which became the southern needle for the treatment of exogenous diseases and also covered the treatment of miscellaneous diseases.</p>
<p>Since Zhongjing, the famous families of the Tang dynasties Sun Simiao and Wang Xi, the four great families of the Jin and Yuan dynasties Liu, Li, Zhang, and Zhu, the Beibei of the Ming dynasties Li and Qi Jingyue, and the various famous families of the Qing dynasties Qi, Xue, Wu, and Wang, although they talked about fire, yin, dampness, and heat, focusing on the spleen, kidney, and the gate of life, they were all different, but they were only supplementing Zhongjing.</p>
<p>More than 130 people have annotated Zhongjing's books before and after, each with their own opinions, inevitably biased, but only Qingxian Wujin Zou Ruanan was the only one who truly recognized the true purpose of the Treatise on Febrile Diseases.</p>
<p>It has been nearly five thousand years since Shennong, so national medicine has a history of five thousand years, making it the crown of the world's learning. From Shennong to Huangdi was the era of medical invention, and until Zhang Zhongjing of the Eastern Han Dynasty emerged, academics were fully prepared. From the Tang and Song dynasties to the present, various great families and famous families have only supplemented Zhongjing's theory. This is the history of national medicine.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Expectations for National Doctors' Day <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yanhe</p>
<p>A guest asked me, "Is March 17th the birthday of Xuanyuan or Qibo, or is it a memorial to Yaowang Jian Shanjun?" I said, "No, no." He said, "Then why is National Doctors' Day set on this day? Is there any explanation?" I said, "Yes, yes. This day is the day in the 18th year of the Republic of China when medical and pharmaceutical circles across the country held a conference of representatives in opposition to the abolition of traditional Chinese medicine. It is now designated as National Doctors' Day, probably because we want to base ourselves on the spirit of struggle from the past and make continuous efforts in the future." However, time does not stay, and six years have passed in an instant. Reviewing the past events, there are things that cause people to feel emotional. On March 22nd of the 18th year, the Shen Bao published an interview with Health Minister Xue Ziliang, "...Currently, most of those engaged in traditional Chinese medicine, except for a few who are enlightened and far-sighted, are sticking to old ways and cannot conduct intensive research and progress. In this era of rapid scientific advancement, if we continue to err and do not catch up quickly, I am afraid that our knowledge will lag behind and we will inevitably be eliminated...In the future, in order to adjust the national economy and improve Chinese medicine, we should guide those engaged in traditional Chinese medicine to study anatomy, physiology, chemistry, pathology, pharmacology, and other subjects separately, and systematically organize the existing medical classics..." However, for six years, those who stick to old ways are still sticking to old ways. The few national Chinese medicine schools, although they are slightly equipped with books on anatomy, physiology, chemistry, and other subjects, have never dissected corpses, and they have no chemical instruments, nor have they ever chemically tested drugs. The past six years are over. What about the next six years? We look forward to living up to Xue's words from the past and not failing the support of all walks of life at that time. Only then will we not be in vain for today's commemoration. Let us all strive together.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Why Commemorate March 17th <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Quji</p>
<p>(Preface) I work as an editor at the Shenzhou National Medicine Association. I am not particularly famous. This time, our medical and pharmaceutical communities are holding a grand "March 17th" commemoration. The gentlemen at the meeting asked me to write an article for the association. I couldn't refuse, so I just casually said some nonsense. I seek the guidance of contemporary masters.</p>
<p>Someone asked me, "Today is March 17th on the Gregorian calendar. Is it your medical and pharmaceutical communities' memorial day?" I said, "Yes."</p>
<p>They further asked, "What is the significance of holding this memorial day?"</p>
<p>I said, "Haven't you seen the 'China-Centered Cultural Declaration' made by ten professors in the education sector recently? Doesn't that declaration contain these three sentences? (1) Review the past. (2) Grasp the present. (3) Create the future. The reason we are initiating the commemoration of this 'March 17th' festival is also this principle." He said, "I'd like to hear you explain this principle."</p>
<p>I said, "If you're not afraid of trouble, please listen to me explain it one by one."</p>
<p>(First) Review the Past. When it was 1929, some Western doctors wanted to test their scientific medical methods and advocated abolishing traditional Chinese medicine. We Shanghai comrades felt that this situation of signing the petition was not appropriate, so we immediately united and organized a National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Organizations. It was established on March 17th of that year. On one hand, we petitioned the government to preserve traditional medicine. On the other hand, we gathered comrades from home and abroad to fight together. At that time, there was a real sense of "a single call from a high place brings responses from all the mountains." In the end, traditional Chinese medicine was fortunately preserved. However, because the medical and pharmaceutical organizations were jointly organized, it was not in line with current laws. Therefore, the National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Organizations was dissolved. Our medical and pharmaceutical communities suffered a setback from this, and countless forces were lost invisibly. This is something that deserves attention and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>(Second) Grasp the Present. Since the dissolution of the National Federation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Organizations, the central government, although complying with public opinion, established a National Medicine Institute. However, its power was limited to academic research. It had no political influence. Last autumn, the gentlemen of the Legislative Yuan understood that our native medicine was indeed valuable and should not be neglected. They immediately passed a set of regulations for traditional Chinese medicine and sent it to the Executive Yuan. Due to certain reasons, this regulation is still on the books but not implemented. Comrades in the medical community have also submitted petitions and gone to the capital to petition, but still cannot get approval. So, our traditional Chinese medicine's political reliance is so weak, how can it still stand on its feet in society? What is the reason for this? Alas. We must understand that this is our self-reliance. Our self-reliance, on the medical side, is having the specialty of treating diseases. On the pharmaceutical side, it is that the medicines have incredible efficacy. These two facts are the real evidence of our self-reliance. Everyone must understand that the current era is an era of survival of the fittest. If we want to exist permanently, we must use our existing self-reliance and work hard practically.</p>
<p>(Third) Create the Future. The two words "create" are not easy to achieve. Moreover, medical and pharmaceutical matters are especially difficult. But our country has an idiom: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." Napoleon I of France also said, "The word 'difficult' does not exist in the French dictionary." Our medical and pharmaceutical communities have experienced many storms in recent years, and we have all realized something. Therefore, we often hear discussions about reorganizing Chinese medicine. This is a very gratifying thing. I think that reorganizing our country's medicine requires written work, which is indispensable. The most important thing is grassroots work. Why? Written work is only for explaining the truth of our medicine and spreading the effectiveness of our treatments. This is academic research, and ordinary people are not interested in it. What they need is to be able to be cured by a doctor immediately when they get sick. This is what they welcome most. Our medicine has already gained the faith of the people. If we put a lot of effort into grassroots work, so that people in society all feel that they must use their own medicine for treatment, then our foundation will be solid. Even if others want to overthrow it, they will have no way to do so.</p>
<p>My feelings about March 17th are like this. Do you think it's right?</p>
<p>That person listened, nodded, smiled, and didn't say a word, then walked away.</p>
<p>So I wrote down this conversation as my article. Please forgive me and give me your guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Hopes for the Future of the Medical and Pharmaceutical Communities <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Tongfang</p>
<p>The March 17th "National Medicine Day." The six medical and pharmaceutical organizations in this city jointly held a commemorative meeting and plan to gradually implement the plan. This is truly a sign of the revival of Chinese medicine and a movement for national health. For the past twenty years, our country's medicine has suffered greatly due to external forces invading and seizing the leading position. It has been difficult to make significant progress in development. This is truly due to the pressure of the situation. Looking at countries around the world, they are all researching Chinese medicine as a newly discovered treasure and purchasing Chinese medicinal materials to make new drugs, which are then resold to our country. The outflow of profits is countless. Today, rural areas are declining, cities are desolate, lost territories have not been recovered, and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. Now that the medical and pharmaceutical colleagues are jointly holding the March 17th "National Medicine Day" commemorative meeting, I dare to offer my sincere suggestions and express my hopes. I hope that it will be implemented gradually and achieve success. Tongfang cannot help but offer a fragrant prayer.</p>
<p>(A) Hopes for the Medical Community</p>
<p>(1) Medical skills are inherently benevolent arts. Those who founded this profession took "social policies for governing the country and saving the people" as their fundamental aim. Physics theory states, "Doctors should not be entrusted without benevolence, cannot be relied upon without intelligence and reason, and cannot be trusted without integrity and purity." Therefore, in the future, academic research should diligently seek ancient teachings and widely adopt new knowledge. Treatment should have remarkable results to show. Find ways to cure diseases that foreign medicine cannot cure. If one person's strength is not enough, then combine the strength of several people or use the strength of a group. Impose compassion for the poor and reduce consultation fees or provide them completely free of charge to conform to the original meaning of the benevolent art.</p>
<p>(2) Deeply believe that traditional Chinese medicine has real efficacy in treatment. Do not be tempted by external forces. Do not make fence-sitting arguments. Adhere to the original intention of "studying national medicine for the sake of national medicine." Hold the belief of "doing national medicine for the sake of national medicine." Smile and nod at those who slander us. Smile and nod at those who praise us. The so-called "facts speak louder than words." There is no need to defend ourselves, and even less to boast.</p>
<p>(3) Traditional Chinese medicine has outstanding efficacy. It should be vigorously promoted to make it known to every household. Provide guidance on hygiene everywhere, whether it is public hygiene or personal hygiene, disease prevention, before and after illness, all should be paid attention to. Do not rely on one prescription to finish the matter. Should be fully responsible.</p>
<p>(B) Hopes for the Pharmaceutical Community</p>
<p>(1) Medicines are for treating diseases. Even with good doctors, if there are no good medicines, medicine is useless. Doctors and medicines are as closely related as lips and teeth. Should support each other for common survival and prosperity. Do not be greedy for huge profits and use fake products to confuse the real ones. Decoction should follow ancient methods. Do not simplify them due to crudeness and simplicity and ruin your reputation. And hope that you will each report on each other and supervise each other, and hold firm beliefs.</p>
<p>(2) Each province has different soil and climates, producing different medicines. Each medicine has its own bias in medicinal properties, and each treatment uses its own. Therefore, when discussing medicine, the first priority is authenticity. Do not misattribute or substitute one for another. This will disrupt the individuality of national medicine and lose its therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>In summary, these points are easy to implement, but must be persisted in to see their effectiveness. The most important thing is that our medical and pharmaceutical communities should unite, help each other, truly connect with each other, and jointly strategize to implement relevant policies in order to break through this difficult situation and reach a bright path. Do you all agree?</p>
<h3 id="e179">Where is the Way Out for National Medicine? <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiangren</p>
<p>Written for the 24th March 17th Commemoration</p>
<p>Is it in business, or in status? These are all matters for one person at one time and have nothing to do with the overall situation. In my opinion, the only way out for our national medicine is to work together on academics, have precise achievements, and gain the trust of good people. All my comrades, quickly rise up and plan for it.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Junior Cup Final; Donghua B Wins the Championship; A Decisive 3-0 Victory Over Xibu B; Excellent Performance Beyond Expectations <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Donghua B and Xibu B competed in the final of the Xilian Football Junior Cup at Yiyuan yesterday. Donghua unexpectedly defeated Xibu 3-0 and won the championship. Donghua won due to its balanced talent, excellent offense and defense, and skilled coordination. Xibu was extremely disorganized, with no cooperation, relying entirely on their burly physique, which was exploited by Donghua. Only a few hundred spectators watched yesterday.</p>
<p>A Sigh of Regret for the Penalty Kick</p>
<p>Xibu kicked off, and Donghua launched an attack on Xibu with clever short passes. They were active in front of Xibu's goal, but Xibu used their tall bodies to head and shoulder barge, trying everything. After repeated attempts failed, Donghua's momentum waned slightly. Then Xibu launched a heavy attack, which was fierce, and Donghua was worried for a while. After about half an hour of back and forth, Wu Binghao led his troops to Xibu's goal, deep into their territory. Seeing the situation was not good, Douglas tackled, but violated Article 9 and was penalized with a penalty kick. Everyone was overjoyed, and Chen Yutian took the kick. He used too little force, and the ball was too low and was saved by the goalkeeper. The whole field sighed with regret.</p>
<p>Wu Binghao Scores the First Goal</p>
<p>Chen Yutian missed a good opportunity, so everyone hoped that he could redeem himself. Ten minutes after missing the penalty kick, Zhang Jinhai was more than ten yards from the goal and took a shot. Alan stretched his foot to block it, resulting in a corner kick. Chen Yutian was an experienced corner kicker, and his placement was accurate and just right. Wu Binghao took a shot from behind and scored into the goal. The Xibu goal, which was not easy to break, finally fell. Although Xibu desperately counterattacked, Donghua led 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Donghua Leads 2-0</p>
<p>After switching sides in the second half, Xibu tried their best to counterattack, but lacking shooting skills and clever coordination, they relied only on their clumsy hard work, which was naturally useless. Donghua defended firmly, moved when the opportunity arose, and attacked and defended each other. After holding out for half an hour, Donghua's center forward Gong Ziwen dribbled straight in. Xibu was recklessly attacking, leaving the defense empty. Gong charged forward, and Alan rushed out to stop him. Marius hurriedly ran in to replace him. Seeing Alan, he quickly passed to Wu Binghao, who took a shot at the goal. Marius was also shot down. At this point, Donghua led 2-0.</p>
<p>Chen Yutian Creates a 3-0 Lead</p>
<p>Donghua's victory was certain. Xibu's counterattack was just a formality. With three minutes left in the game, Donghua scored a third goal unexpectedly. Xibu put all their efforts into the attack, completely ignoring their defense. Qin Zuozi got the ball and dribbled straight in, passing to Chen Yutian on the right. Chen took a shot at the goal, making it 3-0 and securing the victory.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, Youyou B and St. Francis competed in the final of the Zilin Cup at Zhongyuan Stadium. There were few spectators, only three or four hundred, just for decoration. However, the shouts from the east and west were quite lively. Judging from yesterday's battle, the two teams were evenly matched, and their strength was very equal, making the competition intense. However, Youyou's goalkeeper injured his leg and left the game halfway. St. Francis took the opportunity to attack and finally won the Zilin Cup 3-2. The situation at the time is recorded below.</p>
<p>Shi Qi Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>With three rings of the bell and the referee's order, the battle broke out. Youyou took advantage of the weather and its flags were often in St. Francis' territory, attacking horizontally and vertically. St. Francis accepted the attacks passively and defended carefully. Twenty minutes passed in the blink of an eye. Xi Qiaosheng intercepted a ball and sent it to the enemy's goal. Hu Youcheng was tripped by the enemy and could not shoot. Seeing the opportunity, Shen Shiqi rushed to the spot and, with a bang, the ball entered from the lower left corner, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>After Youyou won a goal, the forwards continued to show off their power and attack arbitrarily. Hu Youcheng got the ball at 20 yards and fired, certain to score. However, he was too impatient, and the ball went over the crossbar. St. Francis resolved the crisis and then took the opportunity to attack. Center forward Peterson got the ball and shot hard. Goalkeeper Yang caught it, but the enemy's forwards surged up and surrounded Yang. Yang wanted to avoid the enemy and slipped accidentally, suffering a heavy blow to his leg and falling to the ground. He had no choice but to leave the field, and Xu Wenkui replaced him. Before long, Koumani picked up a ball from the sideline, just in front of the goal. Goalkeeper Xu calmly jumped up to catch it, but the referee's silver whistle screamed wildly. For some reason, a penalty kick was awarded. Peterson took the kick and scored. The audience clamored non-stop. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>Peterson Scores Again</p>
<p>The second half started, and goalkeeper Yang endured the pain to assist in the battle. The competition between the two sides became more intense. St. Francis's right winger crossed the ball, and Peterson arrived without stopping, getting the ball and shooting. Goalkeeper Yang staggered to guard the goal, and jumping was very inconvenient. He watched helplessly as the ball went into the net. St. Francis led 2-1, and Yang's injured leg became even more painful, making it difficult to support him. He had no choice but to leave the field again, and Shi Jinsheng replaced him.</p>
<p>Becomes a 3-1 Score</p>
<p>St. Francis became more and more courageous. Youyou was a crippled army, leaving them to attack at will. St. Francis's right winger dribbled quickly, and at the appropriate point, shot hard at the goal, accurately and quickly, scoring again and making it 3-1.</p>
<p>Ends 3-2</p>
<p>Although they lost in the east, they could make up for it in the west. Youyou, stimulated by this, used their entire army, with a do-or-die spirit, furiously attacking St. Francis's territory. Finally, Xu Wenkui scored a goal, and the audience applauded thunderously. Encouraged by this, Youyou's attack became even stronger. Just as they were about to turn the tide, a long whistle announced the end. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Youyou Team</p>
<p>Yang Mingjin</p>

<p>Tournament Date Set for April 1st to 7th; Invitations Sent to Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces to Participate Enthusiastically</p>
<p>(Hankou Dispatch) The Wuhan Sports Association, to promote sports in the Central China provinces, is sponsoring the Central China Regional Men's and Women's Basketball and Men's Soccer Championships. The competition rules and dates have been finalized, and on the 15th, letters were sent to the education departments of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, inviting them to select outstanding athletes and participate enthusiastically. The original letter and rules are as follows:</p>
<p>Official Letter: We believe that the strength of the national physique is related to the rise and fall of the nation. Education authorities, aware of this, have vigorously promoted sports in recent years, and the atmosphere is becoming increasingly vibrant. However, compared to other regions, the Central China provinces lag behind. After investigating the reasons, we find that they are no more than the following two: (1) lack of effective promotion organizations or groups; (2) lack of opportunities for mutual learning and observation. Therefore, at the first meeting of the Standing Committee of this Association, it was resolved to send letters to the Central China provinces, proposing to hold the Central China Regional Men's and Women's Basketball and Men's Soccer Championships in Hankou during the spring break this year, so that athletes from the four provinces can have the opportunity to learn from and observe each other, making the sports atmosphere more intense and arousing public interest in sports. We have long admired your department's enthusiasm in promoting sports, and we believe that you will support and participate in this event, contributing to its success. Now, we enclose a copy of the competition rules for participation by the provinces, which is sent with this letter. Please investigate and reply by telegram for planning and implementation purposes.</p>
<p>Rules: (1) The tournament is named the Central China Regional Basketball and Soccer Championship; (2) The Central China region is defined as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces; (3) The events are divided into men's and women's basketball and men's soccer, with two championship trophies awarded. This year, the Wuhan Sports Association initiates and is responsible for hosting the event; (4) The date of the event is set during the spring break this year, from April 1st to 7th; (5) The location is in Wuhan this year; (6) Each unit should send the list of athletes by registered mail before March 28th; (7) Each unit must register in Hankou before April 2nd; (8) The number of athletes is ten per men's basketball team, twelve per women's team, and fifteen per soccer team; (9) The number of staff is one head of delegation per province, and one instructor and one manager per team; (10) The Association is responsible for bidding for accommodation and meals for each unit. Each province is responsible for its own transportation costs; (11) The competition system adopts a single round-robin system. The Association will be responsible for the overall planning and management of referees and all sports equipment. (15th)</p>

<p>Not Wishing to Be Perfunctory; Publication Changed to Saturday</p>
<p>The "Female Athlete," edited by the Shanghai Sports and Newspaper Publishing House, has rich content, needless to say. However, because the entire book contains copperplate illustrations, the printing must be very precise, so it cannot be published according to the original date. Therefore, it was once rescheduled for publication today. The publishing house, not wanting to be perfunctory, and for the sake of perfection, has postponed it for a few more days and set it for publication on Saturday. It is guaranteed to be satisfactory to readers. Before publication, pre-orders are still only two jiao, extremely cheap. Now, we list the names of some of the selected female athletes' photos to give a glimpse:</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong, Qian Hangsu, Sun Guiyun, Jiao Yulian, Wang Chunwei, Wang Chunjing, Lan Diqing, Xi Moli, Gao Junzhu, Xu Zhongzuan, Huang Jifen, Guan Liuzhu, Wang Zhixin, Li Yuanfen, Zhang Jieqiong, Zhu Tianzhen, Liang Yongxian, Chen Shuqing, Qin Zhixue, Liao Zhuyuan, Chen Rongru, Chen Jucai, Tao Chun, Su Zuqi, Hu Ruisheng, Chen Yingrui, Sun Zheng, Ma Ji, Liu Yulan, Zhong Pingzhen, Xiao Jieying, Chen Yuru, Wang Dale, Luan Xiuyun, and dozens of others.

Last semester, they competed with Shangzhong Private School, McLaren Middle School, Guangxia Middle School, Moore Memorial, and other teams, and won all the games. This semester, there are even more talented new students. In order to promote sports and arouse sports interest, the school has specially organized a basketball team to conquer Jiangsu, following the high school's Jiangsu tour group, and invited Suzhou Middle School, Soochow University, Yancheng Chenglie, and other famous basketball teams in Suzhou to play friendly matches.

<p>The Lingnan Sports Association performed a play last night at the Guangdong Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road to raise funds. The theater was crowded, and both upstairs and downstairs were full. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Liang Fuchu of the Fifth District, and various directors attended the performance. The Peking Opera programs included "The Imperial Stele Pavilion," "Woman Escorted," and "Playing Phoenix in the Dragon." The Cantonese Opera program was the association's newly written "Virtuous Daughter-in-Law," which satirized society and was humorous and exaggerated, winning a lot of applause. All the actors were members of the association. It is said that tonight's program will be even more exciting.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Soccer World is Worth Referencing <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The Donghua team and the French Business team will compete today for the Skota Cup championship.

<h3 id="e195">Wife of Veteran Athlete Lu Ming Killed by Gunfire in Beiping <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Shot Seven Times and Died on the Spot; Perpetrator Liu Jinggui, Formerly Engaged to Lu; Teng Was a Good Shot Putter, Basketball, and Volleyball Player</p>
<p>An Unprecedented Bloody Case of a Love Triangle Among Athletes</p>
<p>(Beiping, 16th) At around 10 a.m. this morning, at the Tongzhi Girls' Middle School in Fangsheng Hutong, Beiping City, a female guest named Liu Jinggui, under the pseudonym Li Zhenhua, visited Teng Shuang, a female physical education teacher. After being received, Liu and Teng met, and after only a few words, Liu pulled out a pistol and fired seven shots at Teng, all hitting vital points. Teng died on the spot. The perpetrator, Liu Jinggui, surrendered on the spot and was taken into custody by the police. According to Liu's confession, she is 24 years old, from Yihua, Chahar Province, and studied at the Beihua Art School. She did not know Teng. Because after she became engaged to Lu Ming, Teng took away her fiancé Lu Ming, causing her to suffer greatly. She originally planned to kill Lu Ming, but realized that a single woman's ability was limited, so she decided to put Teng to death. Lu originally had a wife. After meeting her in 1932, she asked him to divorce his wife first, but Lu did not agree. Then, at the North China Games that year, he met Teng Shuang. Lu took a job at Lihua Middle School, and Teng asked Lu to divorce his wife. Lu divorced his wife in 1932. In November, he paid her 600 yuan, saying that he was severing previous relationships. She had no way to deal with it and could only endure the pain. In April of that year, Lu married Teng in Yihua. She killed Teng this time to avenge her for destroying her relationship with Lu Ming. The pistol was bought from a rickshaw puller, etc. Dai Ming is a veteran in the sports world and currently works at the Xiahuayuan Station on the PingSui Railway. Because the deceased and the perpetrator are both related to Lu Ming, the authorities sent a letter to the Xiahuayuan Station on the PingSui Railway in Yihua, summoning him to come to the case for questioning.</p>
<p>Brief History of Teng Shuang</p>
<p>Ms. Teng Shuang is from Shaoyang, Hunan, and graduated from Beiping Normal University. She is also an athletic star. She won the shot put championship at the North China Games and was a basketball and volleyball star in Beiping. She was selected for the Beiping basketball team at the 4th National Games in Hangzhou. At the 5th National Games in Nanjing, Ms. Teng served as the manager of the Beiping team. She is the older sister of Teng Shugu, a reporter for the Shishi Daily. Mr. Teng was very saddened upon receiving the news and decided to go to Beiping today to investigate the truth.</p>

The registration period is one month. Anyone who registers to join the association will be given a cheap book purchase coupon, which can be used to purchase the above-mentioned books from bookstores at half price or even lower.</p>
<p>Correspondence Guidance</p>
<p>Anyone participating in the Reading Competitive Association can ask questions about the books by correspondence. After receiving the letter, the association will forward it to the specialized instructors for separate replies. The instructors who have been hired include Li Ximou and others. Several more people will be hired in the future to be responsible for explaining difficulties.</p>
<p>Assigned Staff</p>
<p>The preparatory committee decided to appoint several people to assist the chairman in handling daily affairs in order to ensure that the reading movement spreads throughout the country. Wu Xingya, chairman of the committee, has now appointed Jiang Jianbai as the general manager, Wang Xinming as the general secretary, and Zhou Hanmei and Huang Jingzhai as secretaries.</p>
<p>Expand Publicity</p>
<p>In order to create a good atmosphere for learning and encourage young people across the country to join this reading association, the association plans to expand the publicity of the reading movement. Many methods have been determined, and a large number of slogans have been printed for posting. The most incisive slogans are as follows: (1) In school, you must study hard, and when you buy a book, you must read it; (2) Save the wasted time to read; (3) Using both hands and brains is a great thing; (4) Not only students should read, but also teachers should read.</p>

<p>Children! Look, isn't China now striving for productive construction? The raw materials and machinery needed for productive construction – raw materials are the most abundant in China. If you use your two eyes! And your hands to find them, they are everywhere, but what about machinery? Machinery is the most important tool in productive construction. We need many kinds of machinery, but which kind of machinery do we need the most?</p>
<p>The machinery we need most is machines to manufacture machines. The reason for this is very clear, because if we have this kind of machinery, we can manufacture all other kinds of machinery. In our country, we only have airplanes, but we don't have machines to manufacture airplanes; in our country, we only have automobiles, but we don't have machines to manufacture automobiles; there are so many examples like this. Therefore, we have to buy them from foreign countries.</p>
<p>Children, use your clever minds and lively hands to work hard to prepare to manufacture machines to manufacture machines.</p>

<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Wang'er was a child of bright intelligence and lively movements. Unfortunately, his father passed away due to illness when he was four years old. Therefore, his mother did some needlework and barely managed to support herself and Wang'er. In the blink of an eye, Wang'er was thirteen years old. His mother's health was declining day by day, and she could no longer do much needlework. She wanted to find something for Wang'er to do to maintain their livelihood, so she asked people everywhere to help find a job for her son. But she searched for a month, two months, three months... but found nothing. So his mother became anxious. One quiet night, she tossed and turned, unable to sleep. In the rustling sound of the breeze blowing through the treetops, she thought of a plan: to sell newspapers. Later, she decided on this plan. Before the sun rose, she told her son about the plan, and her son agreed. So his mother said many kind words and borrowed some money from the neighbors as capital to sell newspapers. From that day on, Wang'er went out every day to make a living. Even in heavy rain and cold wind, he had to keep running.</p>
<p>After a few years, the country had a war against foreign powers. He still did his job every day. He also knew a few characters, so when he saw the blood-red characters printed on the newspaper every day, he was shocked. After he had finished distributing the newspaper every day, he sat in the corner, looking at the newspaper very uncomfortably. Although he did not know many characters, he already knew that China was being invaded by imperialism. In his simple mind, he wanted to join the army. Later, as the war gradually intensified, he abandoned his job, left his beloved mother, and went to the front lines. So every day he and his comrades resisted and fought on the battlefield. Unfortunately, a ferocious bomb entered his patriotic heart, and he sacrificed himself. He sacrificed himself for the country! In the whirring sound of airplanes and the booming sound of artillery, he was faintly heard shouting "Long live the Republic of China, long live, long live...!"</p>
<h3 id="e213">Similarities between Animals and Plants <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>The animals like cats and dogs, and plants like flowers, grasses, and trees that you usually see seem to have very different lives. However, in reality, the natures of animals and plants are the same. First, both plants and animals have parents. When a plant blooms with beautiful flowers, its stamen pollen is blown into the pistil, which will produce seeds. Second, both animals and plants breathe. If plants lack oxygen, they will wither and die. Animals stop breathing and suffocate to death immediately. If we look through a microscope, plants have countless small holes, breathing non-stop. Third, both animals and plants eat. Animals eat through their mouths, and plants absorb from their roots, trunks, branches, and leaves. Fourth, animals and plants each have weapons of resistance. Humans use punches and kicks, cats and dogs use claws and teeth to grab and bite, and the fine needles and thorns of plants such as cacti and poppy are all for resisting harm. Fifth, plants also quarrel. When weeds spread wildly and hinder nearby plants, irises will curl up their stems and break the weeds. Sixth, animals love their children, and plants also protect their seeds, like the fruit of coconuts and the thorns of chestnuts. Seventh, both animals and plants need to rest. We get up in the morning and sleep at night, and plants absorb nutrients during the day and stop working to rest when the sun sets. Eighth, both animals and plants have the function of metabolism. The hair, skin, and cells of animals grow and fall off all year round, and the roots, branches, leaves, and bark of plants also often wither and are replaced. From this point of view, animals are tangible dynamic actions, and plants are intangible static changes. The natures of the two are completely the same.</p>

<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>Ming'er is a fifth-grade student at Lizhi Elementary School. His memory is very poor, and his understanding is also worse than others. Therefore, he cannot keep up with his classmates in all subjects.</p>
<p>The teacher advised him to work hard patiently, and several playful classmates gave him the nickname "Dumb Bug." Ming'er accepted the teacher's advice and inevitably felt ashamed and angry at the students' ridicule.</p>
<p>One day, Ming'er was taking a walk in the garden when he unintentionally saw a snail struggling to climb up the base of an earthen wall. The snail's crawling speed was very slow. So much time had passed, and it still had not crawled even a foot.</p>
<p>Ming'er couldn't help but laugh and ask, "Snail! Are you a dumb bug like me? You crawl so slowly, do you still want to climb to the top of the wall?" But the snail didn't say a word and just kept moving forward.</p>
<p>In the evening, Ming'er came to see the snail again. To Ming'er's surprise, the snail had already climbed high to the top of the wall. It was as if the snail was answering Ming'er with facts: "Don't be discouraged, crawl patiently, crawl tirelessly, and even a dumb bug can climb to the top of the wall."</p>
<p>After being moved by this, Ming'er patiently, diligently, and tirelessly studied all subjects. He used his hard work to make up for his shortcomings in understanding and memory. In less than a few months, every teacher praised him, and the students no longer dared to call him "Dumb Bug."</p>
<h3 id="e216">How Do Plants Survive Winter? <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Plants need two things to survive: a suitable temperature and proper moisture. In winter, the temperature is low and the air is very dry. The ground is sometimes frozen, and there is no way to absorb water. Therefore, many plants wither and die. But in the spring, they will still grow or come back to life. Like balsam flowers, they leave behind seeds before they wither, and these seeds will regrow when the weather gets warm (Figure 1). Some plants have stems and leaves that wither, but their roots in the soil are still alive. When the weather turns warm next year, new stems and leaves will grow from these roots; chrysanthemums are like this (Figure 2). Those trees, although their leaves have fallen, their branches and trunks are still alive. When the weather warms up, new buds will grow (Figure 3). Pine, cypress, evergreen, and holly are considered the strongest plants. Their leaves do not wither in winter and are still green and verdant (Figure 4).</p>
<p>If we want to have beautiful trees, we must protect them in winter: flower and grass seeds should be stored in glass bottles, ready to be sown when the weather warms up. For plants with roots left in the ground, use rice husks, ash, and straw to cover the roots to keep them warm. The branches and trunks should be tied with straw to avoid damage from frost, snow, and cold air (Figure 5). If we protect trees, flowers, and grasses in this way, our gardens will surely become lively again when the weather warms up.</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Origin of Felt <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Children, do you know the origin of felt? The origin of felt has an interesting history of discovery.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, there was a foreign traveling monk named Clement. One day, he was traveling to a high mountain; the mountain top was piled with a lot of white snow and yellow sand. It was not easy to walk over this mountain. He was afraid of hurting his feet, so he took two pieces of wool and lined them inside his shoes in advance.</p>
<p>When he walked over the mountain, the bottoms of his feet felt hot, so he took out the wool and took a look. What? The wool had turned into a kind of natural fabric. From then on, the traveling monk came up with the felt-making industry.</p>
<p>Little friends, although felt looks very much like a kind of fabric, it is not woven. The method of making felt is very simple. We only need to press the wool layer by layer so that its fibers overlap each other, and the felt can be made immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Words with Wings <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Hongfu</p>
<p>One day, when my younger brother and I were sitting under a large tree, we suddenly saw a small bird flying into the top of the tree. Later: the little bird sang a song, and after he finished singing that very nice song, he flew away with his wings! We wanted to go see that little bird again, but he had already used his small wings to fly away quickly.</p>
<p>Later we stood up to look at other birds and a bird's nest. Before long my brother saw a small thing fixed on a branch, he said: "That's a green little bird!" So I looked up and saw that it was a green frog, who was jumping from this branch to another branch. My brother looked and shouted: "Ah! He also has wings!"</p>
<p>Frogs' jump, is without wings, they have no wings. But birds have wings.</p>
<p>But "words" also have wings. If you don't hold them tightly, then they will immediately fly away!</p>
<p>Then: "How can you catch them?"</p>
<p>This method is very easy, just think often about their meanings, and be twelve minutes attentive to write and read them. In this way, they will live with you!</p>

<p>Ruizhen found a candle in the drawer and used a small knife to shave a little bit of the wick at the bottom. In the middle of the candle, she pierced a hole with an awl and passed a lead wire through the middle of the candle. The candle could rotate freely. She used another piece of wood with two bamboo pieces standing upright at both ends, with a circular shape shaved at the top. She inserted the lead wire in the middle and then tipped the heavier end down. She lit both ends of the wick with matches. Soon, the lower end would rise up, and after a while, the upper end would fall down again. From then on, moving up and down continuously, it became an automatic seesaw.</p>
<p>Just as Ruizhen was going crazy with excitement, her younger brother Ruizhang came too. Ruizhang watched for a long time and then excitedly asked her the reason.</p>
<p>Ruizhen stopped for a while and then said very proudly: "This is because the two sides cannot be balanced, and the heavier end will fall down. After lighting the two ends with fire, the candle at the falling end is melted more by the fire, and the heavier end becomes lighter and rises up, and the other side falls down. Moving up and down continuously in this way, isn't it the same as a seesaw?" Ruizhang was very impressed by his sister's intelligence.</p>

<p>Whose is the "New Life" promoted by Chairman Chiang?</p>
<p>I think: this new life does not belong to others, it is precisely ours, the children! Because new life is children, and children are new life.</p>
<p>How can we say that new life is children, and children are new life? It is not wrong at all, because children are born into this world lively, with new bodies, new brains, new vitality, new hope, new vitality… Living a new life in all of this newness, then, aren't children new life? Isn't new life children?</p>
<p>Since new life does not belong to others, but to children, then we children should implement our own new life in everything, so as not to fail the new life that we all have.</p>
<p>I wish: now is "Children's World," and the future will be "New Life World."</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>We slept on the beach in the evening, but were startled awake after a little while. I heard a sound nearby. This sound came from a large serpent as long as a palm tree, which had crept very close to us while we were asleep.</p>
<p>It seized one of my friends in its large jaws, and although this man was struggling for his life, shouting at the top of his voice, the serpent devoured him in a moment. Now that I had only one friend left, we were so terrified that we ran away, otherwise, I am afraid we would have provided the beast with a second meal.</p>
<p>I cried, "What dangers we are facing! When we first came to this beautiful island, we were filled with joy, thinking that we had escaped from that black giant, but unexpectedly we are now on the verge of death!"</p>
<p>We saw a tall tree, so we spent the night in the middle of the branches. Before dawn, the serpent found us again and ate my last friend from the branch he was sitting on.</p>
<p>At this time I was extremely afraid, like a dead man, and then I was very happy, because that beast had gone. As soon as it was light, I came down from the tree, but I did not know which road was safe. I first thought of ending my own life and being done with it, but I felt that life was still sweet, so I trusted in God and began to make a safe place for myself.</p>
<p>I took a large pile of branches and long wooden strips and made a tall fence around the tree I was in. I tied the ends of the wooden strips to the branches. Tonight I will hide in my fort.</p>
<p>I had just finished doing this when the serpent came again. It wound itself around the fence I had made, but could not get in to make trouble for me. So he</p>
<p>came down to ambush me, just like a cat ambushing a mouse. At dawn it left me and returned to its lair.</p>
<p>I was weak and sick, because the beast's breath made me sick. When the sun rose, I left the village and came down to the beach, hoping to end my life, but I felt that death was sweeter than living and being so afraid.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the beach, I saw a ship in the distance. I made a flag out of my turban and waved it back and forth, and at the same time made the air vibrate with my loud shouts.</p>
<p>I was very happy to see that the people on the ship had seen me, and soon a small boat was launched to pick me up. As soon as I got on the boat, I told them everything that had happened to me. Then those people gave me the best food and a new set of clothes, because all I had left were tattered rags.</p>
<p>After a few hours at sea, we arrived at the island of Sarabak. We moored the cable in the port. The people on the ship had come to trade, so they took out their packages of goods from the cabin to prepare for sale.</p>

<p>May Contract Speculation Begins: Overall Trend Remains Flat, with Minimal Price Fluctuations Considering Swap Calculations</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the May contract began, with the trend remaining flat. The Central Bank initially sold shillings, causing prices to rise then fall. Sassoon seized the opportunity to cover short positions at low prices. News that the Central Bank might repurchase April contracts early at par led to a rebound, but the market ultimately ended with a mediocre performance. Considering swap rates, offers came mostly from the long side, resulting in a very stable outcome. Initially, the overseas silver market saw British banks covering short positions. After closing, the Indian quote was still selling at a low of .0625. While American banks were long, forward silver prices narrowed by 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Exchange rates continued to rise. London gold fell by 1 shilling and 7.5 pence, stirring sentiment. Off-floor forward trading opened, immediately rising to 67.78 yuan. After the open, the Central Bank announced its official rates, with the British pound stable and the American dollar up by .1875. Customs Gold Units suddenly fell by 0.02, and the standard speculation price dropped to 906.3 yuan. The market opened weakly but quickly regained momentum, briefly surpassing the 70 yuan mark before banks sold to take profits, temporarily halting the rise. News circulated that HSBC's official rates would show a decrease in the British pound by .125, while the American dollar would be little changed, having minimal impact. The market remained mediocre, with many deals occurring after declines. Later, Jardine Matheson attempted to sell but failed, prompting the Central Bank to sell shillings, creating a loose and uncertain atmosphere. This led to wavering long positions and a break below the 60 yuan mark. Sassoon covered short positions at low prices, and large buyers gradually pushed the price back above 60 yuan. Chinese merchants showed increasing interest, fueled by rumors that the Central Bank would repurchase futures contracts at par, boosting confidence. Buying activity then intensified, with prices fluctuating and rising, almost reaching the 70 yuan mark before the Central Bank resumed selling shillings, prompting profit-taking and a midday decline. Swap rates continued to rise, with the long side offering 2.5 yuan. Trading volume was scattered. The following is a record of the market for half the day.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 866.5 yuan, an increase of 4.5 yuan from the previous close. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with Customs Gold Units plunging 0.02. Heng Yu aggressively sold, causing a drop to 5 yuan. Fu Xing Yong Hui Xiang advanced to 9 yuan. Heng Yu and Fu Yu continued selling, bringing the price down to 7 yuan. You Li bought June shillings at .1875. Yong Li, Hui Xiang, Heng Yu, Da Da, Fu Xing, Yong Fu, Yu Qing, and Yong all advanced, raising the price to 70.02 yuan. Ying Xiang, Fu Xing, Yong Heng Yu, Da Da, Wan Xing, and others sold at high prices. You Li sold March shillings at .325, retreating to 66 yuan. Fu Yu, Yi Cheng, Fu Xing, and Yong bought at low prices, pushing the price back up to 8 yuan. HSBC's official rates were expected to show a decrease in the British pound by .125, while the American dollar would be unchanged, dampening sentiment. Hui Xiang, Fu Yu, Yong Li, Heng Yu, and others sold, bringing the price down to 4.5 yuan. Yong Li and Fu Yu continued to buy, pushing the price up to 7 yuan. The Central Bank was willing to sell June shillings at .125. Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan Mao, and others sold down to 3.8 yuan. Yong Li advanced to 5.5 yuan. The Central Bank had already sold June shillings at .1875. Fu Yu, Ying Xiang, Da Fa, Yong Wan Xing, Wan Feng, Fu Xing, and Yong sold down to 1.2 yuan. Da Ying bought May American dollars at .5625. Heng Yu and Fu Yu advanced to 2.1 yuan. The Da Lian group sold Heng Yu down to 1.4 yuan. Mai Jia Li bought June shillings at .25. Hui Xiang and Heng Xing bought contracts, pushing the price back up to 3.5 yuan. Jiao Tong was willing to sell March American dollars. After rising, the price stabilized. Run Chang, Yu Chang, Da Da, Fa Yong, scattered longs, and Fu Yu all aggressively sold, causing the exchange rate to harden and break the 60 yuan mark, falling to 58.8 yuan. Although Yuan Kang Xiang and Fu Xing Yong bought at low prices, pushing the price up to 60.07 yuan, Da Fa Yong Heng Yu Hui Xiang all sold contracts, retreating to 57 yuan. Sassoon bought and settled shillings. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Yong Li, Fu Xing, Ying Xiang, Fu Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Run Chang, and Yong Yu Li all advanced, gradually pushing the price back up to 65 yuan. Yong Li, Heng Yu, and Yi Cheng sold at high prices. Banks aggressively sold May American dollars at 0.5 yuan, retreating to 2.6 yuan. Fu Yu, Heng Yu, Fu Xing Yong, and Hui Xiang all advanced, pushing the price up to 7 yuan. Fu Yu, Yong Li, and Heng Yu then sold at high prices, retreating to 4.1 yuan. After entering, news spread that the Central Bank was still willing to repurchase cash at par. Yong Li, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Wan Xing, Shun Li, and others jointly bought contracts, pushing the price up to 9 yuan. Yu Qing Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Yu, and Da Fa Yong sold at high prices. The Central Bank sold June shillings at .1875, gradually falling to 3 yuan. The midday close was at 863.8 yuan. After closing, Fu Xing Yong actively bought, pushing the price up to 5 yuan. The highest price for the half-day was 870 yuan, and the lowest price was 857 yuan, a fluctuation of 13.2 yuan. The final result was a slight increase of 1.8 yuan compared to the previous close, which was flat considering swap rates.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the Central Bank's standard speculation price of 906.3 yuan, approximately 42 yuan less than the closing price, a decrease of about 12 yuan from the previous close. April entries were at 862 yuan, and May entries were at 864 yuan. The morning water supplement was at 854 yuan. Gold was approximately 5 yuan more, at 871.5 yuan. Tianjin goods were approximately 7 yuan more, mainly because swap rates required the long side to offer over yuan. However, supply was lacking. Initially, Yi Feng Yong offered 2 yuan to Wan Chang Yong for swaps, but Da De Cheng Heng Yu Shen Kang Tong Xin Yong Fu Xing Yong and others offered to buy, reducing the rate to 1.6 yuan. Da Chang Xiang Ren Fa Yong and others continued to offer, and Da Kang also was willing to offer, but there was a lack of short positions. Finally, Qian Chang Xiang offered 2.5 yuan. Trading was extremely fragmented. The Central Bank continued to repurchase April contracts early at par, but in small quantities. Heng Xing and others made offsetting transactions. Although April contracts decreased, the reduction was not significant.</p>
<p>Floor trading was normal. Overall, Fu Xing Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Xing, Run Chang Yong, Da De Cheng, Da Fa Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, and Shun Li were on the buying side. Hui Xiang, Wan Xing, Fu Yu, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Yu Xin Xiang, Yu Qing Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Qing Fa Yong, and Wan Feng were on the selling side. Fu Yu Yu Qing Yong and Da Da Ying Xiang Yong Li advanced first and retreated later. Fu Xing Heng Yu and Hui Xiang retreated first and advanced later. The Da Lian group and Wan Xing jointly traded around 1,100 contracts, netting over 600. Shun Li jointly traded over 300 contracts, netting over 100. The Guang group and Heng Xing advanced over 100, with few retreats. Sheng Da was normal. The total number of transactions on the day was 40,523 contracts.</p>

Da Chang Xiang Yuan Heng Yuan Yi Yi Yu each have over 100. The total remaining number is 5,257 contracts, with 17 long parties and 33 short parties.</p>

The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with the British pound flat and the American dollar up by .1875. Customs Gold Units fell by 0.02. However, because banks had both buying and selling interest, the market remained tight. Banks continued to sell at high prices. HSBC's official rates were announced, with the British pound decreasing by .125 and the American dollar unchanged, with ongoing struggles. Then, Sassoon suddenly showed selling interest, and the Central Bank sold aggressively, causing sentiment to weaken. The process gradually hardened. Later, Sassoon covered at low prices, reportedly benefiting Chinese merchants, and the market slightly tightened. The closing near-term selling prices were: the British pound at 1 shilling and 7.375 pence, and the American dollar at 38.6875 yuan, with the British pound tighter by .125 and the American dollar flat compared to the previous close.

<p>Yesterday was the weekend, and the foreign market was even quieter. The foreign interbank lending rate was the same in the morning and afternoon, remaining at 8%, unchanged from the previous day. Most rollover transactions were due to not wanting to forgo the Sunday interbank lending interest, so they rolled over, creating an oversupply situation. No additional interest was added throughout. In interbank lending transactions, over 3.5 million was transferred in the morning, with over 400,000 in new transactions. Afternoon transactions amounted to over 300,000. The small clearinghouse had over 600,000 in transactions. Foreign mortgage loan transactions saw over 400,000 redeemed and over 300,000 newly issued. Over 1.1 million in banknotes were recovered, and over 800,000 were issued. There were also over 300,000 in coded securities, with over 300,000 cashed out.

<h3 id="e228">Securities: Longs Exit, with the 20th Issue Plummeting .95 Yuan <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly weakened, and selling became more prevalent. The 20th issue, which had been bought previously by the 53rd group, was sold off in each round. The 4th group also continued to sell, and the 47th and 48th groups also sold off a considerable amount. The 20th, 21st, and 43rd issues, etc., did not show strong buying interest. The surface remained oversupplied. The money industry expressed that it would not participate in this credit loan to maintain the market. There is a way to govern, but no one to govern. Maintaining the market is but empty talk. The loan news has disappeared without a trace, and people's hearts are wavering. Longs are exiting. Unless the environment improves, it will be difficult to rebound in the short term. The morning opening saw the 18th and 19th year bonds opening flat to slightly weak. The 20th issue, due to the 53rd group selling at a discounted price, plummeted by .8 yuan, immediately dampening sentiment. Afterwards, various issues followed suit and uniformly trended lower, all down .3 to .4 yuan. The second round only saw the Troop Reduction issue slightly recover, down .4 yuan, with the rest flat. Highs and lows were mixed. The afternoon opening saw the leading issues stable, and the Troop Reduction issue rebounded .3 yuan. The rest were also mixed, with minor ups and downs. Before closing, the leading issues had no transactions, and the trailing issues were weak and declining. Most were down .1 to .2 yuan. As a result of the market prices, only the 19th Customs issue was slightly better, up .051 yuan. The rest all declined, ranging from .1 to .6 yuan, except for the current month's 20th issue, which plummeted .95 yuan due to the long exit. The total transaction volume was 9.825 million yuan. The rise and fall results are listed on the left for comparison. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 15th), the New York stock market rebounded, with the largest rebound reaching nearly 2 yuan. Due to the chaotic currency situation in gold standard countries, gold and silver stocks were in high demand and had the strongest prices. The market was entirely dominated by currency issues. The French franc was near the gold export point, the opposite of the recent situation. European speculators sold currencies of gold standard countries and bought British pounds, causing the British pound to rise by three points. The forward selling price of the Belgian currency fell by one point and had no buyers. Foreign exchange experts doubted whether Belgium could maintain its gold standard in the long term. Railway stocks strengthened, as it was widely expected that the Interstate Commerce Commission would soon approve the increase in railway transportation prices. The bond market was mixed and slightly weak. The small exchange rose slightly with mixed results. Wheat rose due to short covering and reports of large dust storms in the southwest. The total daily trading volume was 770,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Yarn and cloth are weakening, showing a softening trend due to the continuous decline in overseas yarn and cotton prices, which dampens sentiment. Foreign merchants are inclined to sell. However, current month yarn is up due to strong spot yarn consumption recently. Longs are holding on, and floating shorts are covering, causing the current month yarn to rise by 1.3 yuan alone.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Near and Far Inverted) Pre-market opening for speculative yarn showed a more declining market atmosphere due to the continuous decline in overseas cotton industry conditions, which dampened sentiment. However, the current month is up due to strong demand for spot yarn recently. Longs are holding on, and shorts are covering, causing the current month yarn to rise by .8 yuan alone. However, far months are all down .2, .3, and .4 yuan. After opening in the afternoon, spot yarn sales slowed down, with only 1,000 bales transacted. Sentiment remained weak, and far months fell another .3 and .4 yuan. The current month rose another .5 yuan. The total number of bales sold was 1,050 for Yi Chang, 500 for Jun Chang, 400 for Yuan Yi, 750 for Yu Da, 750 for Da Feng, and 500 for Yong Da. The total number of bales bought was 1,100 for Da Fu, 900 for Tong Ji, 1,700 for Jin Chang, 700 for Yuan Yi, 400 for He Xing, 400 for Yi Da, and 400 for Chang Yu.

<p>The cotton market is trending downwards, as the price declines in Indian and American cotton markets intensify, and the calculated prices are decreasing daily. Cheap rough Indian cotton is being traded, so factories show no interest in purchasing domestic cotton. According to cotton industry insiders, there are over 400,000 dan of cotton stored in Hankou, and over 1 million dan of cotton stored in Shanghai, both domestic and foreign.</p>
<p>(Speculative Cotton Softening) Pre-market opening for speculative cotton showed all months trending downwards. The price declines in American cotton intensified, and Indian cotton followed closely behind, causing panic in the market. Selling pressure was slightly strong, resulting in all months falling .1 to .25 yuan. After opening in the afternoon, poor news from foreign cotton markets increased the number of sellers, making the situation loose and weak. All months fell another .05 to .15 yuan. The total number of dan sold was 2,000 for Yuan Da, 1,200 for Ji Feng, 1,200 for Da Feng, 1,000 for He Xing, 3,400 for Guang Feng, 1,300 for Jun Chang, 2,800 for Run Kang, 1,000 for Tong Feng, 1,100 for Yi Chang, and 1,100 for Tong He.

<p>(Indian Cotton Encroaching on Domestic Cotton) Spot cotton consumption is becoming more desolate due to strong declines in foreign cotton prices. Factory demand is decreasing, and it is reported that a considerable amount of Indian cotton has been purchased on the market at low prices in recent days, encroaching on the business of domestic cotton. The sources were 600 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the state of American cotton, due to political, agricultural, and international monetary conditions, left those in the industry at a loss. At the same time, news from Liverpool was unfavorable. Large quantities were sold off from Liverpool, the mainland, and the Far East. Textile mills engaged in hedging sales to protect unsold textiles, while merchants dumped to protect their unsold spot cotton. This led to an opening drop of 17 to 25 pounds. Later, some industry members, brokers, and local buyers stepped in, and short positions were covered, leading to a slight rebound. However, sentiment remained unstable. Demand is currently poor, but there are not many sellers, and the ground is still firm. Transactions in cotton textiles are slightly better. Hays estimates factory use this week at 276,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks at 309,000 bales. The closing was stable, with no change in spot prices and a drop of 13 to 19 pounds in futures prices. Spot prices for British cotton fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 13 to 19 points. Indian cotton was weak due to profit-taking by bulls and a lack of buyers. Pingguoer fell by 3.75 rupees, Aolamu fell by 4.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 6 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (dated 15th).</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 16th is 225 rupees, up 1.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 15th reported on the cotton market for the week, saying that the cotton market last week fell sharply due to disappointment with some changes in the government's cotton production procedures and the uncertainty of next season's plans. In addition, the decline in exports last year increased by 1.7 million bales by January 1, and reached 2.35 million bales by March 11. Furthermore, the factory is discussing automatic production cuts, so pessimism is rampant, and bulls are taking losses in large numbers. Industry buyers are withdrawing limit orders, which has created this disastrous situation. The South and factories are selling heavily to protect their existing cotton and unsold goods. This is because they previously deeply believed that the market would be stable at 12 cents for collateral and had not hedged, but later, statements from Washington led industry buyers to rebound. Agriculture Minister Wallace seems to be too early, and the purchasing power of Southern farmers may not yet be weakened. Market sentiment is mixed, and as soon as there is a turnaround, it encounters profit-taking by bulls.</p>

<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months generally remained firm. Imported wheat was quoted at 8 to 34 cents higher for Chicago, and 8 to 48 cents higher for Canadian. When the market opened, transactions for all months were not　　robust. Because spot flour is still tight, factories have no inventory, and 1134 flour cannot be exported unless approved daily. Under these circumstances, the market does not seem to be able to fall too much. However, as imported wheat continues to arrive and orders are only shifting in terms of exchange rates, buyers are also difficult to excite. In this environment, the market is mutually rejecting, and transactions are even more sluggish. When the market opened in the afternoon, because factories were not dumping, sentiment stabilized, and coupled with good quotations for imported wheat, market sentiment showed a slight boost. The total transactions for the morning and afternoon factories were only 120,000, which shows the general downturn in the market. As a result, this month was up by half a cent, April and May were up by 7.5 mils, June was up by 1.25 cents, July was up by 7.5 mils, and August was up by 1.25 cents.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months generally showed a sluggish and stable picture. Imported wheat was quoted at 8 to 34 cents higher for Chicago, and 8 to 48 cents higher for Canadian. When the market opened, because the quotation for imported wheat was slightly better, sentiment naturally showed a slight boost. However, both buyers and sellers were mostly watching and waiting, and transactions were light. In this situation, it will only be lively when new wheat is negotiated. As a result, this month was up by 2 cents, July was up by 2 cents, and August was up by 1 cent. Spot wheat market conditions are quite smooth, but prices have suddenly dropped by 6 to 7 cents, because imported wheat has arrived smoothly, and there is a feeling that there is nothing special to hold on to. Kaishan Dong Guitai wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen, Bengbu Linhuai wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao half, Xinpu wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao 35 fen, and Yaowan wheat was 3 yuan 6 jiao, totaling 3,500 bales, handled by Xinda.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, more than 50 Ke Bang merchants arrived, (nearly 10,000 piculs in total). In this unfavorable weather, people were in a daze, which caused the sales market to be surprisingly sluggish and extremely dull. Although the sellers shouted for lower prices, there were few inquiries. As a result, actual transactions were not many. For example, only Jinan Bang went for two to three hundred bags of each late rice, and the price fell by one or two jiao, while each thick japonica rice dropped two jiao by mistake. Since the Shejian rice has been out of stock for a long time, the market color is fresh in the air, and the Yin Yuan wheat is weak.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Recently, because the Yuji River blocked the village, few ships arrived. However, sales were slow. In addition to the slight reduction in the price of Northern japonica rice, the price of thin rice was high, and the medium and second grades were close to one jiao. The other goods were also weak.</p>
<p>(Imported Rice) There were slight differences. There were too many high-end goods in stock, and the traders were quite willing to lower the price to sell. Also, the Jiangxi Gang's Jiujiang and Hankou gangs went out of stock and the market continued to weaken by four or five points to nearly one jiao. However, low-grade broken rice and semi-polished rice were welcomed by the inland gangs, and there was not much floating stock on the market. The inland offices sold 500 bags of Saigon rice sugar at a price of 7 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen, which was 1 jiao higher than the previous market price. 2,500 bags of broken rice were opened, and the price also rose by 7 fen. Other Saigon Annam Tarra small twisted rice totaled 5,000 bags, and the selling price generally fell.</p>
<p>(Ke) Opened 461 bags, and continued to be 5 or 6 fen smaller. The main destination was inland. This　　office only handled　　100 tons of futures and 2,000 bags of imported rice.</p>

<h3 id="e238">From Ruan Lingyu to Liu Heying <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The suicide of the actress Ruan Lingyu shocked the minds of people in Shanghai and even the whole country, and earned the tears of many young men and women. This is because her acting skills on the screen made every audience who saw her works admire her wholeheartedly. Her various postures of playing anything like anything were deeply imprinted in the hearts of every audience, making them unable to forget. However, such a talented artist, a movie star loved by millions of viewers, was ultimately buried by the evil society. Ruan Lingyu can only recognize art, but cannot see the society clearly. She cannot use art to expose all the suffering she has suffered and the sins of society to every audience before her death. This is her miscalculation and her weakness. But Ruan Lingyu's suicide is great. Her loyalty to art, her efforts to improve, and her uncompromising work ethic are worthy of admiration by young men and women. Her acting skills are indeed genius, but genius without acquired effort and cultivation, hard work and struggle will still be reduced to mediocrity. Not only will it be reduced to mediocrity, it may even degenerate and be unable to extricate itself. The amazing art Ruan Lingyu left on the screen is definitely not entirely innate. Half is due to her life of painful experiences, and half is due to her dedication and effort to art. Therefore, she is definitely not a decadent woman who uses being a star as a cover, living one day at a time, and taking pleasure as her destination.</p>
<p>When Southern newspapers were filled with news of the death of artist Ruan Lingyu, Northern newspapers were scrambling to publish news of the female writer Liu Heying becoming a prostitute: "Liu Heying, 19 years old, once studied at Beiman Girls' Middle School, and loved literature and art. Three years ago, she had written articles for various small newspapers, and her writing style was fluent and beautiful. Later, she served as a literary editor for a small newspaper and had an affair with a colleague. She was driven out by her father and wandered around. Now she is addicted to opium and has become a third-class prostitute." From this news, we can see that what caused Liu Heying to degenerate was also this evil society and feudal forces. Feudal forces caused a promising young woman to fall into prostitution and sell her body for a living. However, Liu Heying's addiction to opium and no longer striving to write makes her seem to be giving in to self-degradation. Compared with Ruan Lingyu's hard work in art, her half-life of struggle, and her suicide because she could not win, there is a world of difference. However, we still hope that someone will rescue her from the pit of fire, and even more hope that she will use her fluent writing to describe the sins of society and the suffering she has suffered.</p>
<p>The current society is evil, and feudal ethics are eating people everywhere. Young women should strive to understand society, determine their own lives, and take responsibility for transforming this evil society and eliminating feudal forces. This is the right way out. Suicide is not a way out, and depravity is even less of a strategy that young women should take. The real way out is waiting for young women who can endure hardship, be hardworking, and be brave enough to move forward to pave the way.</p>

<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago, the so-called Monkey Trial happened in the United States, causing a stir. This so-called Monkey Trial was about a professor who "didn't know the times" teaching Darwin's theory of evolution in a certain school, saying that the ancestors of human beings were monkeys, not Adam and Eve from some island. This blasphemous remark actually aroused the anger of the American bourgeoisie and was punished. This thought-provoking case raises the following questions for us.</p>
<p>"Is the Christian Bible right after all? Or is Darwin's theory of evolution right?"</p>
<p>In fact, this problem was solved decades ago. The smart American bourgeoisie also understands the truth of evolution very well. Then why oppose this truth? The reason is very simple, in their eyes there is the consideration of advantages and disadvantages, and there is no such thing as truth or untruth. The Bible is their tool of control. Blaspheming it means blaspheming their right to control!</p>
<p>Since the flourishing of biology and historical science in the 19th century, we have learned that humans were originally a type of animal in the ape family, and evolved into modern humans through the laws of evolution. At the same time, we have learned about the evolutionary process of human society before history. The greatest contributors to this area are Darwin, a biologist, followed by Bachofen, McLennan, Morgan, and Engels, who discovered primitive societies.</p>
<p>What are the ancestors of human beings? Darwin's answer to this question was indeed a rebellious statement in the 19th century, when Christianity ruled Europe and America. According to his research, humans were originally an animal, and like other apes, they foraged for fruits in the woods to fill their stomachs, or hunted small animals to feed themselves. They accidentally picked up stone flakes or wooden sticks and used them as tools for collecting food. From then on, humans occupied a dominant position over other animals. Over thousands of years, due to the practical use of labor tools, the front half of human limbs became particularly specialized, and they ceased to be used for walking, becoming the organs of human labor and defense. At the same time, due to the changes in the function of the hands, humans began to walk upright, and human bones also became straight. Later, due to the practical use and manufacturing of tools; the social nature of labor; upright walking and carnivorism, etc., the physical appearance of human beings completely changed, and they evolved into modern humans. In this way, in the process of evolution from animals to humans, the most decisive basic driving force is the manufacture and use of labor tools. Therefore, the 18th-century American politician Franklin said: "Humans are tool-making animals."</p>
<p>That the ancestors of human beings were animals is not denied by those who understand science, except for those who deliberately抹煞the truth because of class interests.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the research of primitive society, the first person to establish a scientific foundation was Morgan. Although before him, there had been Bachofen's discovery of matrilineal society and McLennan's research on the marriage system of primitive humans, it was not until Morgan unified it into a system. He investigated the American Indian nation in the Americas for decades. He detailedly investigated the evolutionary process of primitive society from the formation of "groups", "families", and even "countries", especially his invention of the matrilineal system and the relationship between the sexes in primitive society, which caused a great change in the traditional religious ideas on the issue of gender.</p>
<p>In ancient society, Morgan divided the entire evolutionary process of humans into a savage uncivilized, civilized era, and divided the previous era into early, middle and late three periods, and gave detailed explanations on the human life status of each period. Here, briefly explain its content:</p>
<p>1. Savage Era—Early stage, humans lived in a certain area, using grass roots and tree fruits as food, but already had simple languages; middle stage, began to use fire and used fish as food; later stage, invented bows and arrows, and used birds and animals as food.</p>
<p>2. Uncivilized Era Early stage, invented pottery; middle stage, began to raise animals, cultivate grains, and use dried bricks and stone materials; later stage, invented cast iron and simple writing.</p>
<p>3. Civilized Era—Began to use phonetic alphabets. The written record was made, and the historical era began from then on.</p>
<p>The so-called prehistoric era is the barbaric and uncivilized era. Regarding the issue of the combination of the sexes in this era, Morgan divided it into (1) the blood clan group marriage system, (2) the half-blood clan group marriage system, (3) the pair marriage system, and (4) the polygamy system, which are adapted to the above-mentioned stages.</p>
<p>Each of the above-mentioned eras has new characteristics, which are caused by the changes in human production methods. We believe that the level of development of production methods is the yardstick for dissecting the evolutionary process of human society. Morgan's view coincided very coincidentally with the basic law of historical materialism.</p>
<p>Engels followed Morgan and wrote the book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, and clearly sorted out and explained all of Morgan's research. From then on, the human social situation in the prehistoric era, which had always been hidden in the stuffy gourd, was seen through by people. At the same time, we understood that the religious explanations of the gender issue and the family system were absurd and nonsensical ghost stories!</p>
<p>Finally, let us borrow a passage from Bebel to conclude this section.</p>
<p>"A brief description of the relationship between the sexes in the primitive era is very important for the purpose of this book. This is because we want to prove the following facts and reasons from this. That is, in the process of human evolution in ancient times, the relationship between the sexes has been affected by the changes in production methods and the distribution methods of products. Therefore, in the future, the changes in production and distribution methods will inevitably change the relationship between the sexes. No matter what, there is no "permanently unchanged". In nature and life, the only thing that is permanently unchanged is "transformation" and a change itself." (Women and Society)</p>

<h3 id="e241">How to Be a Stepmother <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Huan Ying</p>
<p>We know that there are many great figures in history who were only nurtured by the love of their virtuous mothers—they had no fathers since childhood—we can also imagine how, from ancient times to the present, many poor families have been able to prevent their children from dying from cold and hunger. Conversely, we can imagine how unfortunate children without mothers must be!</p>
<p>The relationship between parents and children is natural, unique, and irreplaceable. Why is there such a thing as a stepmother? This is because the organization of current society is not yet perfect, and the responsibility of raising children is still entirely borne by their parents. A father whose child has died of the mother has to marry another woman to be the child's mother—of course, also for his own needs.</p>
<p>Living together is really not an easy thing. Except for loving couples and biological children, even if there are, they are reluctantly formed, not combinations of love. These reluctantly formed groups are bound to have discord—such as jealousy, suspicion, hatred, and all kinds of immoral behaviors, especially in the current economic organization of the family; so I often say "It is difficult to be a stepmother, and it is not easy to be a stepchild!"</p>
<p>Chinese women have been influenced by feudal ideas for thousands of years, and even now few of them have a social concept. Most of them regard children as private property. In addition to the natural love between parents and children, they also harbor the mentality of wanting rewards for raising their own children. As for raising stepchildren, the former factors are lacking and the latter is afraid of being unreliable; so they simply use cruel methods to abuse stepchildren! Facts tell us that before women's knowledge was developed, some of the stepmothers dared not completely abuse stepchildren because they had religious ideas. As for the current group of women in the transitional era, they do not believe in karma, and they do not have a correct understanding of how to be a person. Therefore, these means of abusing stepchildren have become more and more sharp!</p>
<p>As for the psychology of children, it is inevitable that they will develop a distrustful attitude towards their current stepmother because they have heard and seen the scenes of stepmothers abusing stepchildren. Sometimes he will restrain the flow of his innocence, and even he will be ashamed to recognize this hypocritical parent-child relationship.</p>
<p>Under the existing family organization, since stepmothers and stepchildren are so incompatible, how should we remove the barriers between the two?</p>
<p>The solution to the whole problem, of course, is to expect the improvement of social organization, so that women and children become social people. Women not only take on family affairs, but also join society to do productive work, and children are handed over to specialized institutions set up by the state to raise them. In this way, stepmothers will definitely be very polite and harmonious with stepchildren, and will never see them as a thorn in their side as before; but this beautiful future will not be achieved overnight, just like it is difficult to put out a fire far away!</p>
<p>For the sake of unfortunate children, we can only beg the existing or soon-to-be stepmothers: hoping that they will completely change their inherent prejudices, recognize that they are members of society, and can fulfill their duties to society anytime and anywhere. Stepchildren are socially helpless and vulnerable lives. In addition to their fathers, society has clearly designated your responsibility—to represent their mothers—you should especially take responsibility, and raise stepchildren as if they were your own children. If a stepmother treats stepchildren with the determination of utmost fairness and selflessness, I think even if the stepchildren are incompetent and ungrateful, they will be moved and regard her as their own mother.</p>
<p>Being a stepmother is like being a doctor and a nurse, it requires great love. A responsible stepmother is worthy of admiration!</p>

<h3 id="e243">Beiping Headhunter Shops <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>In China, in every city, female domestic workers constitute a considerable portion of the population. While some women come from the countryside, many seek work in factories. However, with limited opportunities, they must find alternative paths.</p>
<p>In Beiping, factories are not as numerous as in Shanghai or Tianjin. Coupled with the decline of rural areas in recent years, there is an even greater number of female domestic workers. It is common to see wooden signs on the streets and in alleys that read "Female Domestic Worker Placement Agency," along with a note indicating approval from the "Social Affairs Bureau." The owner of the agency is not a man, but a Madam so-and-so.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I accompanied a neighbor to an agency to hire someone. It was a relatively large establishment. A red cloth banner hung on the wooden sign.</p>
<p>We entered a narrow, cramped alleyway. Inside was a rectangular courtyard. Four or five women dressed in dark and light blue clothing stood there in the warm spring sunlight. Some were washing clothes, others were attaching shoe soles.</p>
<p>"Do you have anyone available to send?" the neighbor asked.</p>
<p>An old woman, around sixty years of age, greeted us with a smile. Although thin, she appeared shrewd. Her eyes, set deep in their sockets, scrutinized people. When she smiled, a row of yellowed, mottled teeth were revealed.</p>
<p>"Yes, plenty," she replied, sizing up the person who had spoken. Then she inquired about the number of people in the household and the type of work required. Most importantly, she asked about the wages. Satisfied with the neighbor's response, she pursed her lips.</p>
<p>"Go inside and choose. There are plenty of young and efficient ones."</p>
<p>We entered the main room, which consisted of three sections. One section was partitioned off into an attached room. Five or six men and women sat around a small platform, playing cards. The men were likely family members of the owner or relatives accompanying the domestic workers. The women may have been prospective domestic workers who were still unemployed.</p>
<p>The card players were engrossed in their game, only glancing at us as we stood watching. We returned to the two connected rooms facing outward.</p>
<p>Half of each room was occupied by a large platform bed. A smaller section of the other room also had a wide, raised platform. The platforms were filled with female domestic workers, anxiously waiting for a place to earn a living. There were gaunt, taciturn women who had just arrived from the countryside, gray-haired, elderly women, and seasoned, worldly women transferring from other jobs in the city. Two women with children sat on the platform. The children were suckling at their mothers' breasts, unaware that they may not enjoy the comfort of their mother's milk for much longer.</p>
<p>"Those two are wet nurses," the old owner said. She probably intended to finalize the arrangements before sending the children back to the countryside with someone to care for them. With readily available milk, she was unwilling to spend money on a wet nurse for a few more days. Moreover, the mothers and children were reluctant to part ways so abruptly.</p>
<p>The eighteen or nineteen women on the large platform sat cross-legged, chatting and doing needlework to relieve boredom. Some hoped to sew a new pair of shoes or a new cloth jacket to improve their appearance. Others, resigned, lay down to sleep. Each had her own bedding (unlike in Jiangnan families where the master provides bedding). At night, they would spread out haphazardly, paying four to six copper coins per night for lodging. During the day, they would buy cheap food to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>"Are there any with large feet?" my neighbor asked, looking around.</p>
<p>The owner laughed. "No, it so happens that all who've come recently have small feet."</p>
<p>A domestic worker, nearly fifty years old, who was washing her feet, chimed in. She was placing a pair of lotus-shaped bound feet in a green basin. "Small feet are no different from large feet, are they? Don't underestimate them. They do a lot of work. They can cook and mop the floor." She said it with a hint of indignation.</p>
<p>The neighbor finally chose a woman in her twenties. Without the "older unmarried daughters" of the South, even a twenty-year-old woman would already be married. It was said that their families were unwilling to let them go, perhaps because they were less progressive.</p>
<p>The owner continued to bargain for a higher wage for the domestic worker. If successful, she would take thirty cents from the first yuan, as was customary. If the wage was four yuan, the domestic worker would have to give her one yuan and twenty cents. At festivals, they would also have to give her one or two dimes. They knew she was exploitative, but they had no choice but to go to her. Even finding her was not easy; one needed a referral from a relative or acquaintance. Otherwise, there was no guarantee of a job.</p>
<p>As we left, we saw five or six people still sitting in the side room. One of them approached and asked,</p>
<p>"Aren't you taking me?"</p>
<p>"You have to wait your turn! They asked for someone specifically," the owner replied. As she saw us to the door, she urged repeatedly,</p>
<p>"Don't call anyone else. I'll send someone for sure tomorrow."</p>
<p>"This person is reliable. Don't call another agency. I'll definitely send someone tomorrow morning." She was afraid we would hire from another agency.</p>
<p>There were too many people seeking work, and those who exploited them struggled even more.</p>
<p>From the city to the countryside, and from the countryside to the city, all were vulnerable, suffering from disaster, disease, and poverty. Only a precarious support system sustained them through these hardships. Perhaps those who had recently fled the famine in the countryside would feel a temporary sense of relief. But if they stayed long enough, they would wonder in bewilderment:</p>
<p>"When will the day come when there isn't even a place to sell one's labor?"</p>
<h3 id="e244">Discussion on the Joint Guarantee System for Private Prostitutes <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Er</p>
<p>The economic downturn has affected public brothels, making business slow. Unable to afford heavy taxes, they gradually become private prostitutes. Furthermore, rural areas across the country are facing bankruptcy, and factories in urban areas are experiencing reduced sales, leading to an increase in unemployed female workers. Unable to sustain themselves, many are forced to engage in secret prostitution. Recent surveys in Guangzhou estimate that there are over 20,000 private prostitutes.</p>
<p>The difference between public and private prostitutes lies in whether they possess a government-issued business license. Those who engage in private prostitution do so to avoid the burden of taxes and levies. However, authorities believe that the proliferation of private prostitution is detrimental to public morals, and they have issued strict orders to investigate, arrest, and punish offenders. Fines typically range from three to several tens of yuan each time.</p>
<p>When these women secretly leave the brothel to entertain or spend the night with clients, they are required to split the meager earnings of three to several yuan with the waiters in the brothel, with the introducer taking 40% and the women retaining only 60%. Out of the 60% they receive, they must also pay for rent, electricity, servants, and food. Having sold their bodies, the money they earn is shared with others. In the end, what remains for themselves amounts to only a few dimes, which is barely enough to cover their expenses for clothing and treatment for venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Therefore, they exhaust every possible means to disguise themselves as female students, loitering in crowded places, employing all sorts of flirtatious tactics to lure men to their secret lairs. Some are sold into servitude and subjected to harsh treatment by their madams, leaving them unable to solicit clients freely or afford the fines imposed upon being caught. As a means of coping with the struggles of survival, they devised a way to share their burden: the "joint guarantee system." They would form groups of ten or more, and if one of them was caught, they would pool their money to pay the fine on her behalf.</p>
<p>This leads us to a question: can we truly eliminate or reduce the proliferation and negative impact of prostitution, uphold morality, and guide women onto the right path through coercive measures such as levying taxes? In reality, the life of a prostitute is far from easy. Which prostitute doesn't yearn for a life of happiness, just like everyone else? Who doesn't want to secure a legitimate occupation in society? Sadly, these are women who have been excluded and abandoned by every sector of society (some also possess limited knowledge), leaving them with no other options. Are they not also essentially good people forced down a path by society, just like everyone else? Now that they have fallen from public to private prostitution, they struggle to sustain themselves even in the secret lives of private prostitutes, leading them to establish the joint guarantee system… in order to preserve and prolong their lives. Such an infinitely variable approach to preserving a life that is barely human. Can this be stopped by any kind of pressure? Can it be eradicated by a mere formal campaign to abolish prostitution?</p>

<p>London Dispatch: During a heated debate in Parliament on a Labour Party motion to impeach the government for its military expansion policy, an unexpected interruption occurred. Several women in the audience threw leaflets advocating peace, scattering paper throughout the assembly hall. These women also loudly condemned the government's defense white paper. They were immediately escorted out by parliamentary police. Subsequently, several other women in the audience staged a similar demonstration and were also expelled. Simultaneously, a crowd of approximately two hundred people, mostly women, gathered outside the Parliament building, intending to meet with lawmakers to express their opposition to the government's policies.</p>
<h3 id="e246">A Visit to "Glutinous Rice Ball Beauty" <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Er Yu</p>
<p>Although the cry for gender equality has long been resounding, it is not easy to determine to what extent women's rights have actually been extended in the past decade or two. Recently, our local newspapers have been vigorously promoting beauty contests, with "Glutinous Rice Ball Beauty," "Blacksmith Beauty," and "Lipstick Beauty" all being considered for selection. Is electing "beauties" elevating women's rights? In any case, I believe it contains an element of insult. Men's tricks for making fun of women are becoming increasingly innovative, and women cannot tolerate this kind of disguised insult! However, the "beauty group" in our county accepts it submissively and even "smiles with delight," which is truly perplexing! To understand the "beauty group's" submissiveness, I took action to visit the "Glutinous Rice Ball Beauty" on the afternoon of February 11th!</p>
<p>A small, two-dish restaurant-like glutinous rice ball shop at the entrance of North Gate Lane was doing thriving business. The two tables were full, leaving no room to squeeze in. The customers, who appeared to be students, were joking and laughing casually. The so-called "Glutinous Rice Ball Beauty" had a fair, oval face, disheveled hair, and a tall figure. She dealt with the customers very skillfully, always smiling. Young men flocked to the shop, coming to have a cigarette and a couple of glutinous rice balls, which was much more economical than going to a teahouse! Such is the psychology of men and women! It was difficult to find a spot in the corner of the shop, giving me only five minutes for the interview.</p>
<p>I began my visit to the "beauty":</p>
<p>"Are you called Beauty, is that right! I've heard so much about you!"</p>
<p>"It's all nonsense. The newspaper folks are making up some 'beauty' for me. I don't understand it, sir!" She giggled for a while.</p>
<p>"You seem very happy! I know!"</p>
<p>Her face suddenly tightened, and she said softly, "You know!"</p>
<p>"Business is good, isn't it!"</p>
<p>"Business isn't bad. I make about ten or more yuan a day!"</p>
<p>"Good business should make you happy. No one can keep up with you!"</p>
<p>"Good business makes me happy? Hmm!"</p>
<p>"I walk past your shop every day, and you always seem to be smiling and greeting customers!"</p>
<p>"What else can I do? If I don't, how will I eat? Do I want to do this?"</p>
<p>A small handkerchief lightly covered her eyes.</p>
<p>The shop assistants in the glutinous rice ball shop glared at me. I knew that I had stirred up trouble with my words. Then, the door slammed open, and two young men with dark hair and in Western suits rushed in. The "beauty's" hand was squeezed tightly. She greeted them with a smile.</p>
<p>"Have a seat! Mr. Pan!"</p>
<p>"Four ounces of Chen Shao wine, four glutinous rice balls, and sixty cash worth of peanuts."</p>
<p>I walked out of the shop.</p>
<p>Along the way, I thought about how there are many women similar to the "Glutinous Rice Ball Beauty" among the 200 million female compatriots. For the sake of livelihood, they are tossed about under the lash of suffering. While the women's rights movement has been fought very vigorously, the result has only been the liberation of women in the upper and middle classes. The "Glutinous Rice Ball Beauty" will never be liberated in her lifetime!</p>
<h3 id="e247">The Courtesan's Demands <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yue</p>
<p>Recently, while leafing through old newspapers I had previously clipped, I felt that many old stories were worth revisiting. Here is one small item among the many old stories that is worth mentioning. I will now transcribe it below:</p>
<p>"After being abandoned by a former Qing dynasty official with a purple ribbon, a high-ranking courtesan entered a women's reformatory to find a suitable match. There was no shortage of people hoping to marry her. However, because two of the courtesan's demands could not be met, she refused to compromise. The two demands are: (1) The man must be of a suitable age, and she refuses to be a concubine. (2) The good man who marries her must respect her right to freedom and must not infringe upon it in any way. Upon hearing these demands, all those who wished to marry her found them to be difficult to fulfill, it is said."</p>
<p>After reading these two demands of the courtesan, I felt that they were very ordinary conditions. Why did those who wished to marry her find them difficult to fulfill? I thought that since there was no shortage of people hoping to marry her, the demand for a "suitable age" would probably not be a problem. The problem clearly lay in the issues of being a concubine versus a wife and the need to respect her freedom and not infringe upon it in any way.</p>
<p>Upon careful consideration, these two conditions are mutually contradictory. A man who cannot afford to take a concubine would certainly respect her freedom and would not infringe upon it, but such a man would not be able to support her. A man who can afford to spend money on her, even if he does not take her as a concubine, would at least not respect her freedom and would always infringe upon it to some extent. Therefore, in the end, everyone felt that these two conditions were difficult!</p>
<p>In fact, the courtesan's situation reflects the fate of women in general. When women follow poor men, they always argue because he cannot support her. When women follow rich men, they always complain because he mistreats her.</p>
<p>The fundamental cause of this situation naturally goes back to the economic relations of the society at the time. Women's inability to be independent and their dependence on men are entirely characteristic of our society.</p>
<p>This old news item is already about ten years old. Now, women already have occupations. However, if we were to republish this old news item in the newspaper, people would certainly believe that it was a recently occurring news story, wouldn't they? This illustrates that these two very ordinary conditions that the courtesan demanded are still considered difficult to fulfill even after ten years!</p>
<p>Alas, after so many years of women's movements, even the courtesan's demands have not been granted, so what is there to talk about in terms of women's liberation! If things continue in this way, I believe that the courtesan's demands will never be granted if the economic relations of society do not change.</p>

<h3 id="e248">"Hard" and "Soft" Articles <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Lie</p>
<p>I say, there are two types of writing: "hard" and "soft." By "hard" articles, I mean theoretical articles on science, politics, economics, and so on. By "soft" articles, I mean poems, novels, plays, lifestyle sketches, humorous pieces, essays, and the like – articles with artistic characteristics. If all articles express human thoughts and feelings, then the characteristic of "hard" articles is that they discuss theories, using the power of understanding to express certain thoughts and feelings. "Soft" articles are the opposite; their characteristic is not in discussion but in description, vividly and concretely depicting certain thoughts and feelings. Good "hard" articles explain a truth in detail from all aspects. Those who are good at writing such articles not only have correct views but also possess very rich arguments. They do not engage in abstract concepts or list formulas casually, but explain a correct theory with many practical and historical examples. They not only have abundant materials but also possess a systematic scientific method. They can gradually and methodically integrate their materials into their theory, without any confusion. When they write, it's like peeling bamboo shoots, layer by layer, very clearly, without any omissions or mixtures, making it very easy for the reader to understand. Therefore, although good "hard" articles are relatively rigid, they are also interesting to read. For example, the "hard" articles of Engels and Plekhanov, although their theories are very profound and not easy to understand without a higher level of philosophical and scientific knowledge, if you have the ability to read their works, you will find that everything they say is logical, and they capture your heart with undeniable facts and truths. As for those shallow and foolish people who write "hard" articles, they either pile up materials in a chaotic manner or play with abstract nouns or overuse formulas. Therefore, regardless of whether the theory itself is correct, their articles become increasingly annoying to read. Like the good "hard" articles mentioned above, good "soft" articles depict human life very subtly and concretely from all aspects. Those who are good at writing "soft" articles have a deep understanding of the life they want to depict. The scenes they create are completely alive, making the reader feel as if they are present in the scene. The emotions of joy, anger, sadness, and fear that they express are extremely real, immediately evoking the same emotions in the reader. When we read Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," when our eyes encounter the protagonist's murder and the situation after the murder, our hearts also beat faster, feeling a little afraid, but no matter how afraid we are, we still want to read on enthusiastically. Similarly, when we read Bernard Shaw's humorous articles, we also laugh. When we see the most tragic scene in Tolstoy's "Resurrection," we can't help but shed tears, feeling great sadness. What is the reason for this? I believe it is because those great writers are good at writing "soft" articles. They can truly and artistically express a certain form of human life, thought, and emotion, making you unable to avoid feeling deeply moved when you read them.</p>
<p>Although "hard" and "soft" articles each have their own characteristics, they are not absolutely different. In my opinion, there is "softness" in "hard" articles, and there is "hardness" in "soft" articles. "Hard" articles are not as hard as steel, without any gentleness. "Soft" articles are not as soft as cotton, without any strength. Obviously, good "hard" articles can not only conquer people's thoughts but also move people's feelings. Those who are good at writing "hard" articles naturally have very correct thoughts and very passionate feelings. When they write, they not only avoid dry and tasteless discussions but also use vivid words to describe the thoughts they express. Therefore, I say there is "softness" in "hardness." Similarly, good "soft" articles are also written under the guidance of correct theories. Someone who is good at writing "soft" articles not only possesses great artistic expression but also has a progressive worldview. When they express a certain social life, they are not doing so unconsciously but consciously depicting it under the guidance of their progressive worldview. Therefore, I also say there is "hardness" in "softness."</p>
<p>However, because "soft" articles have more emotional content and depict social life vividly and figuratively, using words that we use in daily life, they are easy to read and understand without much thought. Some people who write "hard" articles often like to use the form of "soft" articles to express their "hard" theories, and that is because of the aforementioned. At present, the general cultural level in China is certainly very low, and more advanced "hard" theories are not easily understood by novice readers. Therefore, some people who write "hard" articles often look for problems in the daily lives of general readers, using the form of "soft" articles (such as plays, novels, or storytelling) to express their "hard" theories. For example, the "Street Talks" in "New Life" and the various academic lectures in the new magazines that "softly" write "hard" articles can all be said to have arisen from this. This method of "softly" writing "hard" articles is certainly very good, but it is not easy to write such articles well because it requires not only correct theories and a deep understanding of the lives of general readers but also considerable descriptive talent. However, it is difficult for those who are used to writing "hard" articles to immediately acquire all these knowledge and abilities and "soften" their articles appropriately. Therefore, I advise those who write "hard" articles that if they have the talent to "soften" their "hard" articles, they can certainly do so to increase their impact on society. If they do not have this talent, then I hope they will learn slowly and not rush to publish those inferior "hard" articles written in a soft manner, lest they disturb the eyes of the general readers. Truly, those who do not have the talent to "soften" "hard" articles, if they insist on forcing themselves to do so, the result will certainly be something that is neither "hard" nor "soft," and it will be like nothing at all. Recently, I have seen many articles that use the form of "soft" articles to talk about the "hard" theories of natural science, and they not only lack the fun of "soft" articles but also make the content empty because the authors are desperately trying to work on the form (and the form is certainly not well-worked), ultimately making their articles neither male nor female, like nothing at all. I believe that such articles that "softly" write "hard" articles are no better than good original "hard" articles. Therefore, I say: do what you can do, and don't do things you can't do and make a fool of yourself!</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>and various academic lectures in new magazines that "soft write" hard articles etc, they can be said to be born out of this. Of course this method of "soft writing" hard articles is good, but it is not easy to write this type of article, because this not only needs to have correct theories, also needs to have profound understanding about the life of general readers, and also needs to have significant descriptive talent, but it is difficult for people who are used to "hard writing" hard articles to immediately fully have these knowledge and abilities, and to "soften" their articles reasonably, so I advise to general people who "hard write" hard articles, if they have "soft" talent, then it is of course acceptable to "soft write" their hard articles, to increase its effect on society, if they do not have this type of talent, then it is hoped that they will slowly go to learn, do not rush to then publish the low-level hard article written in a soft manner, and go to disturb the eyes of general readers. Truly, if those who do not have the talent to "soft write" hard articles, if they must "hard" their scalp to "soft" dry, then what they write will certainly be "hard" is not "hard", "soft" is not "soft", doesn't look like anything. Recently I have seen many articles that use the form of soft articles to talk about the "hard" theories of natural science, and they not only do not have the interest of soft articles, also because the authors desperately go to work on form (of course the form has also not been well worked) (thereby causing the content to be empty, finally making their articles become neither male nor female, don't look like anything like that type of article that "soft writes" hard articles, I believe is not better than good original hard articles. Regarding this I say: can do what, still go do what, don't go do what you can't do and embarrass yourself!</p>
<h3 id="e249">Railway Heroes <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shuxun</p>
<p>All those who seek to profit on the Pinghan Railway – vagrants, hooligans, disbanded soldiers – are called "Wild Cavalry Braves." This is a nickname given to them by railway personnel, and its history is perhaps as old as the railway itself.</p>
<p>These fellows are perhaps the sons of farmers, or brothers of workers; in short, they have no land and no work. For the sake of survival, they have learned the tricks of petty theft. And because the railway provides them with opportunities to steal, they come here to seek profit.</p>
<p>Obviously, they are neither employees nor passengers, but they are constantly moving in and out of the carriages, running around the stations. What are they doing running around? Naturally, they are trafficking in smuggled goods, stealing luggage, stealing coal, and deceiving villagers. In short, they are engaging in all sorts of irregular tricks!</p>
<p>Northern heroin (white powder) relies on them to be transported to Hankou, and southern opium relies on them to be transported to Beijing. They are the saviors of addicts and the salesmen of human sin (others create the sin). But they do not understand the harm or benefit to society; they only know that if they can obtain profit, they will do anything!</p>
<p>The so-called smuggled goods are not just drugs; they include all business that can make money and evade customs duties. For example, pears and dates from Cizhou (between Henan and Hebei provinces, where Cao Cao's seventy-two tombs are located) can be sold to Hankou for double the profit, and bringing copper coins back to Beijing can yield a 40% profit. There is no empty return trip, and there is plenty of profit to be made.</p>
<p>However, to do this business, one must have at least: first, capital; second, reputation. What business can you do without capital? Who would dare to risk transporting smuggled goods without the ability to operate? Ordinary vagrants and hooligans do not dare and cannot do this, so those who engage in this business usually have other backgrounds, or are directly managed by the old heroes among the Wild Cavalry Braves. As for poor fellows just starting out, they each find a way to make a living according to their own abilities. The younger ones have to steal coal. But although they are small, their skills are extraordinary. When the coal car is two or three li from the station, they leap into the carriage. They lift the coal blocks up and pass them down, and people below move them elsewhere. By the time the car enters Yangqi (about half a li from the station), they have finished their work and slipped across the opposite wasteland. Every coal train that stops at the station loses at least several tons of coal. Although there are police guards along the way, it is difficult to take care of everything. The prerequisite for stealing coal is to learn to grab the train. No matter how fast or slow it is, one must be able to get on and off freely (naturally, there are also those who die in the attempt). Even if the guards try to catch them, they cannot. If they want to shoot, they feel it is too trivial. In fact, coal is their life. Even if a gun or knife is held to their neck, they will still try to reclaim their life. Moreover, their clothing blends with the coal ash, forming a natural camouflage. If it is a hazy night, no one can tell whether they are people or coal!</p>
<p>Those who steal luggage are mostly strong young heroes. Not only are they skilled at grabbing trains, but they are also capable of all kinds of stealing techniques, because they practice this skill every day of the year. They can skillfully disguise themselves and blend in with the passengers. If they want to steal from a soldier, they will dress up as an officer themselves. In short, their attire must be changed at any time according to the type of business. What they steal is naturally mostly small things (such as handbags, hats, small suitcases), but sometimes even quilts and large suitcases are stolen. Often, the theft is successful and the owner is unaware. Even if they discover it early, there is nothing they can do, because the thief can jump off the train. This kind of business is usually done by several people together: someone is on the lookout, someone does the stealing, and someone blocks the owner. Everything is arranged very well, and it is rare for things to go wrong. However, it is more difficult in the first-class and second-class carriages of express trains. There are constables and police here, and there are fewer passengers, making it difficult to hide. If it is a slow train, it is very casual. There are no noble passengers here, and no police protection. As long as they take a fancy to something, they can get it nine times out of ten. If you take a slow train from Hankou, the crowd is so dense that you can hardly breathe. Most of them are here to seek profit. Once you pass Hengdian, you will notice that the number of people decreases, but at this time you can hear at least a few people shouting that they have lost something. The first few stations of the train rarely check tickets, so there are particularly many people who want to seek profit. When they arrive at the station, whether they have achieved their purpose or not, they mostly jump off the train and wait for the opposite train to come, so that they can find return business.</p>
<p>There is also a type of disbanded soldier who roams the railways. Because they have their own set of broken military uniforms or old insignia, they can ride slow trains and coal trains very freely. Thus, they often travel on the Pinghan Railway, on the one hand engaging in petty theft, and on the other hand deceiving the common people. The methods of deception are nothing more than: first, posing as recruitment committee members. Three or five people patrol the streets and alleys, waving recruitment flags. When they see a young boy, they boast: that place is prosperous, that unit has good treatment – three meals of rice, a salary of more than ten silver dollars, talking a blue streak, with oily mouths. Thus, they lure apprentices and farmers' sons. After they have registered, they deliberately publicize it to the parents. If the parents do not want their son to be a soldier, they must pay money to redeem him. Otherwise, the soldier's clothes and money will be swindled away by the "recruiters." Second, escorting passengers: villagers always love money and are reluctant to pay for train tickets when they want to go out. The disbanded soldiers hear this news, so they volunteer to take someone there, requiring only a few cents for tea money, and promising to ensure everything. The villagers are greedy for cheapness, and know that the soldier lords have this ability, so they fumble around and produce a few cents, and timidly follow the soldier lords onto the train. But soon the soldier lord slips away and disappears. They have to fumble for money to buy a ticket – or perhaps be kicked off the train.</p>
<p>When we arrive on the north bank of the Yellow River, if we pay attention, we can see recruitment committee members waving paper flags at every major station (Xinxiang, Zhangde, Shunde, Baoding, etc.). These are the disbanded soldiers who deceive the common people. At the same time, every slow train and coal train is filled with gray animals, at least half of whom are Wild Cavalry Braves. Why do these fellows like to operate on the north bank of the Yellow River? According to my guess, perhaps it is because the poor boys in the north envy the rice in the south!</p>
<p>The entire Pinghan Railway has become the territory for the Wild Cavalry Braves to operate. However, because of the different regional environments, various roles have also emerged. The north produces heroin, and there are also particularly many drug dealers. Zhangde produces coal, and the coal-stealing boys can form teams. As for the cutthroats like Li Gui, the area from Hankou to Xinyangzhou is the most prevalent, especially between Guangshui and Wushengguan, which is the place for heroes to display their talents. They not only rob luggage, but sometimes also send you back to your hometown: I have encountered being thrown off the tracks twice in this area. According to people on the same train: the first time was revenge, the second time was because the owner resisted. At the time, I was really wary, and felt that the difficulty of traveling was greater than ascending to the blue sky! These fellows like to cause trouble here, simply because there are more mountains, which are convenient for escape, and not as others say: the people of Hubei are inherently unruly!</p>
<p>The railway heroes, on the surface, naturally display their own unique abilities, with no one to control them. In fact, there is a close organization inside, with each having its own scope of activities. Coal thieves cannot rob luggage. The Wild Cavalry Braves on the north bank of the Yellow River cannot cross the south bank to intercept wealth (there are also times when they collude). Each organization has strict discipline, with the highest leader (the boss). The little fellows charge and fight outside, and all the wealth they obtain is handed over to the boss, who distributes it freely. However, although the boss sits and divides gold and silver, he also has to support the little fellows in ordinary times, and must also take full responsibility if any trouble is caused. The situation is similar to that of the Gelaohui.</p>
<p>The title and position of "boss" are entirely obtained through struggle. In the history of the Wild Cavalry Braves, it is unknown how many meritorious deeds have been recorded. Today, the hooligans and rascals on the Pinghan Railway have a place to live, all thanks to the foundation laid by the bosses. He claims to be alone and leads the masses, which is entirely appropriate. To know that a dignified transportation agency is actually being infiltrated by them, who can say that the boss has no merit, no ability?</p>
<p>If one earns the name "Wild Cavalry Brave," it is equivalent to Zhang Heng and Li Jun on Jieyang Ridge, who can dominate one side. Who would dare to call him a vagrant or a hooligan? Who would dare to call him a bad egg? If he wants to show his power, he can immediately call up hundreds of brothers, and perhaps the transportation agency will be thrown into chaos!</p>
<p>Industry Investigation</p>
<h3 id="e250">Huai Bei Brewing Industry <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Xun</p>
<p>The brewing industry in Huaibei is not only the best in Jiangsu Province, but also compares favorably with the wine-producing regions of the entire country!</p>
<p>The main products of the rural areas there are sorghum and wheat, both of which are raw materials for wine. The wineries do not have to obtain them from distant markets. At the same time, many winery owners are mostly landlords who own wheat fields, and use their own raw materials to brew their own wine, which can save a lot of trouble (even if they still need to buy, it is supplied by nearby markets). Moreover, rather than selling sorghum and wheat, it is more profitable to turn them into wine. For these reasons, the brewing industry has become widespread in Huaibei.</p>
<p>If we tour Huaibei for a week, we can find many wineries in the villages and towns of Donghai, Guanyun, Ganyu, Lianshui, and Muyang. In short, the entire Huaibei is a wine-producing area. From this we can know the important relationship between the brewing industry and the rural economy. It can also be said that the winery is the representative of the Huaibei rural economy. From its prosperity or decline, we can measure the real situation of the countryside.</p>
<p>Wineries come in different sizes, and the wine they produce is also divided into two categories (i.e., what the locals call "big wine" and "small wine"). Large wineries brew "sorghum wine" (the name is sorghum wine, but the raw materials are sorghum and wheat mixed together). Small wineries can only produce "local-brewed imitation Shaoxing wine" (small wineries are also called "small pot stills," and local-brewed wine is also called "local yellow wine"). The two not only have different names, but also differ greatly in value and sales. However, I will simply point out: big wine can be sold in distant places, and each dan (100 jin on a scale) costs about 20 yuan or more. Small wine is only retailed locally, and each zuo costs a maximum of 8 yuan. It must also be explained that large wineries are completely commercial organizations, while small wineries are only considered a side business of farmers. Whether they brew wine or close down is not planned.</p>
<p>Compared to other wine-producing regions, Donghai and Ganyu produce more? Muyang's wine tastes the best, so its value is higher both locally and far away (Muyang wine costs 27 or 28 yuan per dan, while others only sell for 22 or 23 yuan). However, that depends on whether the buyer is an expert, because the wine transported to distant places all carries the "Huaibei Wine" brand. The quality of the wine naturally depends on the quality of the water. Wine brewed with water that contains less salt tastes better, otherwise it is the opposite. It should be known that ordinary drinks in Huaibei are salty. It is harder to drink a cup of "fresh water" tea than it is for a poor person to drink coffee!</p>
<p>The main markets for Huaibei wine are Shanghai and Nanjing. At its peak, the wine sold in Shanghai alone averaged around 1,000 dan per month, and the value was also very high. The winery owners were mostly fat and well-fed, and their pockets were also full. This aroused the envy of speculators, and many local tyrants and gentry transformed themselves into wine merchants. At that time, there were more than 80 large wineries in Ganyu County alone. If we count the entire Huaibei, it is a large number.</p>
<p>But good times don't last forever, and the full moon is hard to see again. The prosperous scene has become a memory of the past. Under the shadow of this nationwide economic recession, the brewing industry cannot escape its bad fate: sales are blocked and prices are falling. The wine that used to be sold exclusively in Shanghai has changed its course and is being sold chaotically in nearby counties.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Biography of Einstein (Continued to End) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Cong Mu</p>
<p>In Germany, the "Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung" published a portrait of Einstein in November 1919. The people of Berlin then knew that such a great scholar lived in the same city as them. Later, Einstein's name spread throughout Germany, and some even named their newborn children Albert. For a time, Einstein and his theory of relativity became a fad in the world. However, at the same time, the resentment caused by Einstein being Jewish also rose higher and higher.</p>
<p>In 1921, Einstein was invited to lecture in Paris, which was the first time that France had invited a member of the German intelligentsia after the war. But at that time, the hatred between France and Germany was very deep, and it was dangerous to speak German in the streets of Paris, so the organizers who invited Einstein specifically explained to people that he was Swiss, not German. At that time, Einstein was of course a newcomer in the German academic world, and there were many people who doubted his theories, but after listening to his lecture, everyone admired him. The mathematician and mechanician Painlevé was also one of them.</p>
<p>Not long after, Einstein was invited to lecture in London. When he took the stage to speak, Lord Haldane introduced him to the audience: This man is the Newton of the twentieth century, even greater than Newton, a person who has awakened an intellectual revolution. It is said that because he was a Jewish German, no one initially applauded to welcome him. After Lord Haldane's skilled introduction, the audience noticed the importance of this new discovery and realized that learning and art have no borders. Thus, Einstein was welcomed. After that, he went to lecture and teach in various parts of the United States, and of course he was very popular. It is said that once when he lectured in a certain city, there were as many as five or six thousand people in the audience.</p>
<p>In 1922, Einstein was invited to Japan by the "Kaizosha" and was also very popular.</p>
<p>(Six)</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, Einstein had nothing to do with general mobilization because he was a Swiss national. At the same time, he did not participate in the famous declaration issued by ninety-three German university professors during the war. At this time, no matter how tense the surrounding atmosphere was, he still worked hard on his research and completed the general theory of relativity. His attitude was like Hegel's during the Napoleonic Wars. However, the German nationalists during the war were very opposed to the Jews, and after Germany's defeat, this anti-Jewish situation became even more intense. They thought that the revolutions in Russia and Germany at that time, and the unrest in Europe, were all the result of the conspiracy of the Jewish people. Einstein was Jewish, and of course he was an object of opposition. His theory of relativity, which was called a scientific revolution, was also regarded by those anti-Jewish people as one of the Jewish people's conspiracies to subvert the world, and was attacked.</p>
<p>After the war, when the rejection of Jews was at its height in Germany, one day in 1919, Jewish intellectuals in Berlin gathered in a restaurant to discuss the future of the Jewish people. Einstein had originally left the shackles of the Jewish association, but he attended this meeting. After quietly listening to the speeches of those Jewish people, he had the idea of saving the Jewish people from their real suffering. This was not because he himself was Jewish, and completely out of selfish psychology, nor was it due to a momentary emotional impulse, nor was it because he had any Jewish ideas and reasons. No, the reason why he did this was because the Jewish people had suffered cruel abuse, and he was standing on the position of humanitarianism, wanting to rescue them from the abuse. From then on, Einstein contributed his great strength to the Jewish question.</p>
<p>By 1933, the political situation in Germany had changed, and Einstein was greatly coerced by the authorities. He left his residence in Belgium in September of that year and went to England, and in October he crossed the sea to America. He is still continuing his great research, and is using his spare time to lecture in universities in the United States and France. (End)</p>
<p>The old signboards with large capital can still be maintained, otherwise they will lose money and cry out in pain!</p>
<p>So they struggled hard and came up with many tricks to escape the great disaster in front of them. The so-called "tricks" are nothing more than saving expenses (abolishing apprenticeships, laying off workers) and reducing costs: they tried to mix as much local yellow wine as possible into the sorghum wine they transported and sold in distant places. In each zuo, there were at least 70% small wine, but they still used the brand of big wine. In this way, although the market price was low, the cost was reduced. At the same time, they did not wholesale local yellow wine from small wineries. They also set up small pot stills as needed, and their function was naturally to produce local yellow wine, which was specially used to dilute big wine.</p>
<p>But this effect is only equal to sleeping pills. Over time, it is still a policy of suicide. On the one hand, wholesalers can only be cheated once, and at the same time, "the deadline is approaching," and no matter how hard they struggle, it is only a deathbed glow! The recent situation has become even more dangerous: the wine transported to Shanghai has been reduced to 17 or 18 yuan and there are still no customers. Many wineries' "runzhang" (wine salesmen) have been stranded in Shanghai for half a year, and they are just sighing at the inventory! As for the story of the robbers who copy small roads often have the joke of the original jar of wine turning back. The sales in distant places have been blocked, but there are many wines that have never been out of the house, and they are transported to Shanghai and Nanjing during this bad wind, which is not learning fashion, but is really an unavoidable contradiction! It should be known that if the winery does not brew wine, the cellar mouth will deteriorate after a considerable period of time. If the wine is put into a jar, the amount will gradually be lost, and in order to take out the capital, it has to be sold urgently. But the local sales are limited, and the competition between the wineries is fierce. In this way, they have no choice but to transport it to other places to try their luck!</p>
<p>Last year, the entire Huaibei winery almost came to its final fate. About 50 large wineries announced that they were closing down, and as for small pot stills, it can be said that they have all closed down. Among them, Ganyu suffered the greatest losses, because Liu Hei Qi (Liu Guitang)'s bandit army once looted the county seat, and disrupted the countryside for several months (such as Shahe and other places bordering Shandong). During the looting and disturbance, the sales of wine were blocked, and the capital was also extracted, and under the trampling of the cavalry, the wine jars and cellar mouths had to be destroyed!</p>
<p>In short, the brewing industry in Huaibei has declined from prosperity to depression, withering, and desolation! I have seen large wineries reducing the number of cellar mouths (the more cellar mouths, the more prosperous the business is), and I have also seen them dismantling boilers and selling livestock, until they "close their doors and declare victory"!</p>
<p>The decline of the brewing industry is not only the bad luck of the winery owners, but also affects the entire Huaibei countryside! (Naturally, the bankruptcy of the countryside affects the brewing industry.) As mentioned above, the main products of Huaibei are sorghum and wheat, both of which are raw materials for wine. In the era of prosperity of the brewing industry, wineries accounted for two-quarters of the sales of both. Now that many wineries have closed down, sales have decreased by at least 10%. In the past, wheat could also be sold to Shanghai and Nanjing, but it was resisted by American wheat, and not only did the market price fall, but it could not even be exported. (American wheat occupies the quasi-city market!) In this case, the landlords who own wheat fields are also burnt out!</p>
<p>Also: the winery in the villages of Huaibei is like a rural money house. It sells cash back elsewhere, buys local raw materials, and disperses the cash. At least it has the function of regulating finance for the Huaibei countryside. At the same time, the development of the brewing industry means that wineries need more labor, so that some of the unemployed in the countryside have a place to eat. But now that wineries are gradually closing down, the rural economy is extremely poor, and the unemployed group has added many new forces. In this way, the decline of the Huaibei brewing industry has such a serious impact on the countryside!</p>

<p>In the face of the current urgent world economic crisis, both Chinese and foreign people are doing their best to explore a way out of recovery or prosperity. The United States is the richest country in the world; at the same time, it is also the main part of the world economic crisis that has deepened the most. Although people may not take the United States as an example when seeking a way to recover or prosper, recalling the historical situation of American capitalism when it dominated the world with a rapid posture in those years may be of some help to our understanding and research!</p>
<p>As early as four or five years ago, when the American economy was prospering, its heavy industry production accounted for about half of the world's total. At that time, its coal mining volume accounted for 45% of the world's total; cast iron, pig iron and steel accounted for 50%; and oil accounted for two-thirds. As for the production volume of copper, tin, zinc, etc., it also ranked first among the countries of the world. The development of light industry can almost be said to have advanced completely in conjunction with the development of heavy industry. Especially the progress of agriculture, American rubber production is</p>

<p>— Piyi</p>
<p>Guanzi said, "Think and think again, think even harder. If you think but cannot understand, the spirits will enlighten you. This is not the power of spirits, but the utmost sincerity."</p>
<p>Zhang Hongfan was a Yuan general who helped Kublai Khan unify China. When his army reached Yashan in Guangdong, later generations mocked him in a poem: "Zhang Hongfan carved his name on Yashan, not a barbarian, but a Han Chinese."</p>
<p>Lord Fan Zhongyan once said to people: "It's easy to be a regular official, but hard to eat regular meals." Lu Ling Tan Dajing said: "If a man can be content with eating regular meals, then he can be content with being a regular official." This saying is also enlightening.</p>
<p>Xin You'an sent a poem to Qiu Zongqing, saying: "For thousands of years, where can one find Sun Quan, the hero of the Yangtze River? The pavilions and towers, once filled with romance, are now swept away by wind and rain. The setting sun shines on the grass and trees, and ordinary alleys. People say that Liu Yu once lived here. Imagine the iron horses of that year, with a spirit that devoured thousands of miles like a tiger. Yuanjia hastily sealed Langjuxu, only to win a hurried glance north. Forty-three years, looking at the lights in the distance, I still remember the road to Yangzhou. Alas, looking back, beneath the shrine of Emperor Tuoba Tao, there is only a scene of divine crows and community drums. Who can ask if Lian Po is old and can still eat?" This poem is exquisite and magnificent, worthy of immortality.</p>
<p>Layman Dongpo said: "Raising a cat is to catch mice. One should not raise a cat that does not catch mice when there are no mice." Nowadays, there are those who raise cats that do not catch mice, but instead catch chickens. Is it acceptable to raise such a cat?</p>
<p>After Yan Ziling helped Emperor Guangwu restore the Han Dynasty, he drifted away into seclusion, whereabouts unknown. Someone saw him wearing a fur coat, fishing by the riverbank. Emperor Guangwu searched for him, but again, his whereabouts were unknown. People all said that his character was one level above others. However, someone later wrote a poem satirizing him: "Once he put on a sheepskin coat, he had ambitions. His false name has been praised to this day. If he had worn ordinary clothes back then, where could he be found in the vast Yin River?" Is this an excessive criticism?</p>
<p>When Hu Dan'an met Yang Shishan, Guishan raised both elbows to show him and said: "My elbows have not left this desk for thirty years. Only then have I made progress in the Way." Is this what is called studying to death?</p>
<p>In all matters, one should always have a mind like a rolling ball and hands like a sounding arrow. This is what Yang Dongshan said.</p>
<p>Yi Yin served Tang five times and Jie five times, and the people of the world never considered it a disgrace. Su Shi commented on it, saying: "Those who handle great affairs of the world have great integrity; those who establish great integrity for the world are broad-minded. If the greatness of the world is not enough to move their hearts, then great integrity cannot be established, and great affairs cannot be handled."</p>
<p>One man is enough to surpass Yu, and three households can destroy Qin. Facts prove both.</p>
<p>When Li Ji was on his deathbed, he said to his younger brother: "If my sons and younger brothers have ambitions that are inappropriate or associate with the wrong people, kill them first and then report it to me." His words were so stern.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Cunwen Association and others issued a declaration, saying: "With the fear of Yi Chuan for the Rong people, we pledge to serve the country with our writings." Is this the beginning of the saying "serve the country with writings"? Another way to save the country has been added.</p>
<p>The third day of the third month is the memorial day of the fall of my hometown county. Waking up on this day, I immediately recalled the lines, "Warhorses and chariots in the arena of fame and gain, who remembers the old setting sun in the gardens? The Han family still has bronze men's tears, flowing towards the wind, weeping for Emperor Wu." I couldn't help but feel a mix of awe and sorrow.</p>
<p>Dongpo's poem from prison: "Dreams linger around the clouds and mountains, my heart like a deer, my soul flies through boiling water and fire, my life like..." After being released from prison, he wrote a poem: "Facing the wine cup, I suspect it's a dream, picking up the pen, I'm already like a god." Without the slightest intention of repentance, it can be said to be unique.</p>

<p>75% of the world’s total; tobacco accounts for 38%; wheat for 17%; and cotton for more than half. In this way, its agricultural development not only makes full use of its geographical advantages, but also fully promotes and assists industrial production.</p>
<p>In the midst of such a magnificent advancement in the American economy, according to statistics from 1927, its wealth was more than 30 trillion francs, accounting for about 40% of the world’s total wealth. The total amount of cash it held in various banks at that time accounted for a large proportion of all cash in the world. As a result, the United States has become a usurious creditor to countries around the world. It not only has the qualification of being the first in the world's exports, but it is also the primary monopoly "super-profit" maker in terms of foreign investment of financial capital.</p>
<p>Compared to the capitalism of countries such as England and France, the economic development of the United States can be said to have grown in a short period of time. The reasons for this rapid development and enrichment should of course be scientifically explained from the particularity of American social history and geographical conditions.</p>
<p>The first characteristic in the history of American economic development is the absence of feudal barriers to capitalism. We know that when Europeans migrated to the United States, except for the southern regions where land was successfully divided by a feudal-like method, the northern regions were ... [text missing]. Because the southern regions formerly had a slave system, Europeans easily transplanted the feudal system there, and the natives readily accepted it. However, the northern United States had a vast area of free land. This free land had a decisive significance for the subsequent development of American capitalism.</p>
<p>Europeans initially only immigrated to the Atlantic coast of the northern United States. (This is the most densely populated area today.) The westward expansion from this region began in the 1770s. At that time, the central government and the state governments stipulated extremely low prices for selling land to the people. For almost a century, people could acquire land without having to pay a large price. This was the government's policy of encouraging people to move west rapidly. In 1860, the area west of the Mississippi River accounted for only one-seventh of the total population. But in 1910, the population there accounted for one-third of the country. During the latter half of the 19th century, American agriculture (except in the South) did not suffer from a lack of leased land. This situation helped farmers to develop fully and also accelerated the accumulation of capital. At that time, farmers were free owners of the land and also entrepreneurs. Because landowners can make full use of the resources on the ground, they can supply cheap raw materials to industry, and laborers in industrial centers can obtain cheap food. In particular, the result of the development of capital accumulation in agriculture itself can make the booming industrial products sell well in the domestic market. Therefore, American capitalism was characterized by the free and parallel development of agriculture and industry from the beginning. The simple reason why manpower and natural power can be coordinated in the development of industry is that American social history did not have feudal barriers to its capitalist development.</p>
<p>There is also another thing that we cannot ignore: that is, during the upward period of American capitalist development, it was not monopolized by larger capitalist countries of imperialism. On the contrary, the already developed British and French capitalism in Europe served as an excellent reference for the American economy. This is meaningful for both the management and technology of American capitalism.</p>
<p>As for studying from the characteristics of productivity, the wages paid by American capitalists were slightly higher than those in Europe. Because it was easy for laborers to acquire land and make a living, capitalists naturally had to offer higher wages to get hired when they went to work as wage laborers. Because of this, American capitalists had to find ways to increase their production efficiency in the adoption of machinery and the productivity of workers. This can be said to be the reason why American capitalists had to pay close attention to the improvement of production technology. No wonder many large capitalists or entrepreneurs spent enormous sums to organize scientific research institutes or laboratories, promoting various new inventions by many technicians and laborers. Regarding this aspect, it is of great significance in the development of the American economy.</p>
<p>In addition, the mechanization of American agriculture and the development of land and sea transportation have also directly affected the promotion of the manufacturing of means of production. This kind of progress in the means of production has almost completely divided and ordered the American economic system. This is also a major condition for American economic development.</p>
<p>As described above, the American economy has been developing smoothly. Therefore, in the nearly ten years of smooth sailing, there was little waste due to domestic riots or wars. For example, in terms of the number of troops, the current US Army has only about 110,000 people, which is less than one-third of the number of troops in Sichuan Province in China. This is a natural result of the fact that the American democratic political order is sufficient to maintain its economic system. This political and military characteristic has had great significance for the development of the American economy in the past few decades. However, since the recent crisis of American economic panic has become widespread at home and abroad, the cost of maintaining riots, strikes, and preparing for international wars has indeed exceeded that of all countries in the world.</p>

<p>Taking a break to stroll through the spring suburbs. Appreciate the scenery of the suburbs carefully. See the willows shading the willow bank. Beside the bank, you can also see the blooming peach trees, peach blossoms turning into brocade waves, and smoke misting the willows, willows reflecting peach cheeks, making the flowers even more beautiful. Beautiful birds fly and sing on ancient trees, and in the forest, a wine flag is fluttering. The tourists on brocade horses sit, urging their horses to cross the small bridge. Under the bridge, the fishermen buy wine and drink it. They drink fragrant glue, and get drunk and happy. Remotely looking at the bamboo forest, the houses are stacked with greenery. Green pines and cypresses connect to the sky. The mountains and rivers are high and low like a painting. In the painted building, flutes are played. When the sound of the flute fades, the sky is about to dawn. Xiaofeng passes by the temple bell from afar. The tapping makes the ambition more luxurious.</p>

<h3 id="e260">The Expression Method in Literature <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Innocence</p>
<p>The reason literature is called an "indirect art" lies in the fact that its means of expression—words—merely represent a certain concept in a conventional way. Readers accept the image's reflection and evoke the inherent concept in their minds. Only after these two concepts are mixed can they touch the true realm indicated by the literary work. At the same time, the inspiration we gain from stimuli is fleeting. To reproduce the whole picture of the spiritual feeling that exists and vanishes in an instant with dull words, even with skillful techniques, only captures a fraction of it. Therefore, the method of expression in literature is one of the important preparations for a writer—especially someone newly entering the field of literature.</p>
<p>We do not deny that Chinese literature has embarked on a new path in recent years, both in terms of subject matter and style. However, apart from deliberately using words to decorate dry bones and confuse the reader's vision, most of the works with life reveal a weakness in expressiveness. Because of the essay-like narration of stories, the necessary resonance is reduced, which is a major loss for the author.</p>
<p>Flaubert once said: "No matter what we want to express, there is only one noun; to describe its movement, there is only one verb; to assign its quality, there is only one adjective. We should patiently excavate until we seize the only noun, verb, and adjective. If we merely find something similar to these nouns, verbs, and adjectives, we must not be satisfied, and especially must not be afraid of the hardship of searching and carelessly shirk our responsibility." Flaubert's famous saying as the "single word theory" in the history of literary criticism; we believe that creators should still practice it when engaging in creative activities today. Because when depicting typical characters based on realism, the depth and extent of the character's personality depend entirely on the communication of the expression method, especially the two contradictory personalities of the intellectuals who have fallen from the petty bourgeoisie of the metropolis in the current stage. If there is an uneven exaggeration in the writing, it will become something neither donkey nor horse. In works, writers should also pay attention to the emotional part. Just as music has its high and low notes, and painting has light and dark, literature, depending on its content, should also have a crisp or melancholic tone.</p>
<p>The great realist Dostoevsky's distinctive feature in his works is chaotic mechanics. His descriptions of the conversations of people living in the basements of cities are rapid, fragmented sentences, with words closely repeating each other, and morbidity and dark clouds envelop the lower layers of the city. He wrote of streetlights "scattering gloom like candles in a funeral," of clocks "emitting sharp sounds like clenched throats," of small houses "like pigsties and chests," and of wind "buzzing and screaming like flies begging for food on garbage." How appropriately this tone captures the other side of the civilized metropolis! To associatively and symbolically promote the seriousness and impetus of the theme, it is necessary to have a unique vocabulary to record the tone of the metropolis's noise. This is worth learning from Dostoevsky's works. Gorky said it well: "The most important technique of literature is the study of language (i.e., words). Language is the basic material of works, especially in the novel genre. It (the novel) is a 'beautiful language' written in French or Russian. 'Beauty' is—sound, color, speech, and story, the product of human emotions and intellect created through the hands of the writer. That is, a writer uses artistic skills to harmonize content and form, and arouses people's empathy with amazing exaggeration. We call this 'beauty.'" He also said: "The true beauty of mechanical language is the correctness and clarity of the language for mood, character, and the ideas that form the work, and the influence created by this. The writer—'artist'—should have the ability to select correct, clear, and powerful language from the rich treasury of vocabulary and broad knowledge. That is, between chapters and sentences, use correct language—in the meaning represented by the language—to arrange, harmonize, and patch together, to visualize the author's thoughts and clarify the situation, so that readers can discover the vivid posture of human beings under the author's flexible brush... And—the world develops from the dynamics of struggle. Literary artists should have a careful study of language, that is, they must have the talent to choose concise, refined, appropriate, vivid, and beautiful language in order to achieve a high degree of effect in their works..."</p>

<p>Hollywood—this name seems too familiar to us. Needless to say, it has been recognized as the de facto "film capital" of the world for more than twenty years. But now the British film industry is not willing to lag behind and has established its own "film capital" to compete with Hollywood. This British film location is Elstree.</p>
<p>Hollywood—also translated as Holliwood—is because when that place was still covered with undergrowth, it was full of a kind of small tree. Its botanical name is "birds don't roost," because its branches and leaves are thorny, and birds cannot perch there. This kind of small tree is called Holly in English, so that place is called "the forest where birds don't roost." Elstree—this is still the first translation—I don't know what the original meaning is. Probably, judging from the "tree" in the name, it used to be a place where trees grew.</p>
<p>Elstree is a place in the suburbs of London, but like Hollywood, it has a sense of borrowing and attaching meaning. We are used to saying Hollywood—Hollywood is the entirety of the American film industry, a collective noun for the film industry. But the largest American company, MGM, is not in Hollywood, but in Culver City, which is adjacent to Hollywood. Elstree is similar. In general parlance, although it is the gathering place of the three major groups of British film companies, large British companies such as Gaumont British are in the nearby "Shepherd's Bush."</p>
<p>Having explained the above point, we don't need to mention it again, and just continue to treat Elstree as a synonym for the British film industry, just as we habitually use the three words Hollywood to represent the entire American film industry. However, Elstree and Hollywood have one fundamental difference. Hollywood is a colony of film industry employees, where all people related to film production, producers, directors, actors, extras, technicians, tea boys, messengers, etc., live, breathe, and work. But Elstree is just a factory. They go to work during the day, and at night they disperse and return to various parts of London, mixing in ordinary society, watching plays, dancing, or staying quietly at home. Some people say that because of this difference, Elstree will never be as full of scandalous news as Hollywood.</p>
<p>Elstree is five thousand five hundred miles away from Hollywood. But the terminology, symbols, gestures, etc. used in Hollywood can also be seen and heard in Elstree studios. What about silence, what about lights, what about cuts, the two places are equally noisy. In Elstree, you can see the same set bones, piled up like mountains: Shanghai's gambling den "Attention"; Dickens-era military quarters; a corner of Paris; you can see them everywhere. Therefore, except for the London smog, which is unique to Elstree, there is not much difference.</p>
<p>Therefore. If Hollywood actors run to Elstree and give them the same rich salary, they will definitely feel like they are at home. In the past, during the heyday of Hollywood for more than twenty years, British and European movie stars, anyone who wanted to earn a big salary and gain a great reputation, must first be baptized by Hollywood. Nearly half of the European superstars were absorbed by Hollywood. But now, Hollywood has not only released foreign stars, letting them automatically run to London, but also many American stars want to go to Elstree to make movies.</p>
<p>Of course, the Americans have to say grandiosely: "In the past, we borrowed half of their stars, and now we also lent many stars to them. The United Kingdom and the United States are originally brotherly countries of the same race and language. With the mutual exchange of so many stars, the friendship between the two countries will definitely become closer because of artistic mutual assistance and promotion." It must be known that the above words are diplomatic terms. The comings and goings of stars are not like university professors or lectureships, which can be exchanged through relations between the two countries. Money, money, money is the driving force behind their circulation. The UK and the US are not promoting each other, but competing with each other, trying to manipulate the hegemony of this big business, and wanting to win the world's film market.</p>
<p>Whoever can gather a lot of money can attract big stars, as well as technical talents, directors, writers, etc. In this war of commodity art, we return to our country, how can we reach even one ten-thousandth of others. We are the chopping board and axe, and they are the fish and meat, how can it not make people feel discouraged?</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e262">Review of "Difficult Struggle" <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ren</p>
<p>—Carlton—</p>
<p>Although generally speaking, Chinese films are progressing, individual works still show a great deal of backwardness. As recent as "Difficult Struggle" is a failed product.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the stories here are not connected. The explanation of the story can satisfy the audience to a certain extent, but "Difficult Struggle" does not even achieve a direct narrative of the story. The most obvious explanation in the brochure says "On graduation day, Mr. Zhu... gave a speech to the students... Do not 'recognize' the four northeastern provinces as lost territory..." etc., but it is not on the screen, so that what Yang Guoguang said at the beginning about Mr. Zhu makes the audience confused. (As for the issue of the four northeastern provinces, even if they are not "recognized," they are still "lost territory." The issue is how to resort to a national war to recover the lost territory.) When university teachers talk about "rights" and "obligations" in jurisprudence, the clumsiness of such shots, talking for two or three minutes, also shows that the story only focuses on stiff preaching, completely losing the artistic value of the film. Lack of obvious connection, roughness, and disorganization are the biggest problems with the script. As for further discussion of the content, it cannot be said in a few words.</p>
<p>Not exaggerating at all, the directing or acting here shows vulgarity and naivety. The author of "Like Water Flowing Years" has regressed to such an extent. Here, there is only clumsy preaching, not the expression of film art. As for business, it will also give producers a good practical lesson.</p>

<p>— Guo Cheng</p>
<p>"The Man Who Reclaimed His Head" is another anti-war film with serious contemporary significance.</p>
<p>The burden of war, the sins of war, the hypocrisy and deception of war, the terror of war, and the crimes of those who do evil through war are all nakedly exposed in "The Man Who Reclaimed His Head."</p>
<p>The performance of such a film for us on the eve of the secret deployment of the clouds of World War II cannot be said to be meaningless.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Claude Rains plays the lead role in this film. He previously starred in "Invisible Man" and "Crime Without Passion" and became famous. Joan Bennett plays the female lead in this film. Her past successful works include "Bulldog Drammond" and other films. In addition, in this film, the three-year-old child star Baby Jane has a very sensational performance. She has previously appeared in "Have A Heart" and "Were Rich Again"; she has recently played a very important role in the world-shocking great ethical film "Imitation of Lmitation of Lito" (Chinese name "Spring Breeze Autumn Rain". This film will also come to China).</p>

<h3 id="e267">The Hate of India's National Subjugation (Clive of India) (1) <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>Produced by the 20th Century Company of America, starring Ronald Colman and Loretta Young</p>
<p>Robert Clive was a madman—at least that's what many clerks of the British East India Trading Company believed at the time. Clive was stubborn by nature. He hated the extravagance of ordinary merchants. He hated the mechanical life of clerks, registering endless numbers in large ledgers every day. He disobeyed his superiors' orders. As a clerk, he hired someone to hold an umbrella for him. In the Indian daytime, the scorching sun was unbearable, but as a clerk, he shouldn't be afraid of the heat. Clive's ignorance of his own limits greatly angered Pemberton. What made people think he was crazy was that he openly accused Johnston's door plate of being fraudulent. Johnston also worked for the same company, but his position was higher than his. Johnston wanted to duel with him. Clive agreed. But when the two heroes met, Clive only fired a blank shot into the air. Johnston watched the young man's arrogance and couldn't help but feel angry, but he couldn't raise his gun.</p>
<p>But he was unwilling to show weakness and deliberately threatened: "Do you still dare to say I'm cheating?" Clive replied: "I still say you're cheating! You have the ability to shoot!" Johnston still couldn't raise his gun. After a while, he threw the gun on the ground with a ashamed face and walked away, muttering hatefully: "This man is crazy!" This man is crazy, everyone believed again this time, except for Edmond Macsgreen. Macsgreen's feelings for Clive were always the same, and he was deeply convinced.</p>
<p>In the mid-18th century, the wealth of India's treasures and products was beyond the wildest dreams of imperialists. Gold and silver everywhere, rare spices, and priceless treasures made desperate young people from the Netherlands, Portugal, England, France, and other countries willing to travel across the ocean and endure all kinds of hardships to come to the tropical region where it was hot all year round and there were widespread miasma. All they wanted was to plunder some treasures and money, load them up and return home, and never have to worry about eating and wearing them for the rest of their lives. However, since the races and nationalities were so diverse, they began to hate and kill each other. Everyone hid behind someone else, wanting to get a chance to grab his throat, kill him, and seize more treasures. They especially liked to collude with the local tribes, borrowing a knife to kill people and drive out people of another nationality, so that they could enjoy trade! Simplicity is the monopoly of looting. So the white people in India, because of different nationalities, began to kill each other freely.</p>
<p>Day after day, long caravans of camels carried all kinds of treasures to the trading pier. Day after day, merchant ships loaded with treasures crossed the ocean and transported them to Europe. This outflow of financial resources has continued for many years without exhaustion. The officials stationed in various countries, the big merchants, have successively packed up and returned to their hometowns and became rich men. However, the clerks in the company, with their humble status, seemed to never have a share of unexpected wealth except for a limited salary. But despite having no share, who didn't come with extravagant hopes? Robert Clive was one of them.</p>
<p>Clive came to India and lived a tasteless bookkeeping life, and felt restless. He said angrily to Macsgreen: "If I had known that this kind of life was all empty, I would have committed suicide!" Edmond comforted him: "Calm down. Don't make a fuss. If you keep making a fuss, we will have no place to stay." Clive frowned and pondered. He suddenly saw his friend's neck with a thin gold chain hanging, with a small gold box hanging below. He had seen it before. But this time, he unconsciously held the thing in his hand.
