<p>— 彦</p>
<p>本市錢業領袖。鍳於已往營業政策之未臻妥善。不足以控制當前艱難之局勢。曾於十六日在内園招集臨時會議。對於目前蕭條之局面作一度之討論。並有營業新方針之决定。以冀改善環境而穩定該業之基礎。其營業新方針凡分三項。（見二十日各報。）</p>
<p>（一）中央中國交通三銀行本届大結束時向各錢莊所放押欵。迄今尚有五百萬元以上未能按期贖回。此項押欵例以二月為期。届滿即須取贖或請轉期。致使各莊提心吊膽。時感侷促不安。故錢業方面現希望中央中交等行將訂期延長。改為三月一結。俾資周轉。</p>
<p>（二）通告各莊。對於採辦洋貨商號。其中尤以銷售奢侈品之商號。不予信用借欵。藉以减少入超。間接可减少白銀大量岀口。</p>
<p>（三）市面未復常態以前。各莊營業取最慎重態度。其對於業務之信用借欵。復無限制者。尤宜力圖謹慎。以厚實力。同時對於各方面之存户。更當設法為其作安全之保障。</p>
<p>就此三項而觀。第一項為押欵轉期問題。其二三兩項雖同屬於放欵政策之轉變。但亦各有其原因與作用。請分别申述之。</p>
<p>（一）當二十三年總結賬前。榮康益康德昶寶大裕等四莊以週轉不靈。先後猝告倒閉。影響所及。銀錢兩業均呈空前之緊張。設非中央中國交通三銀行有巨額押欵之放岀。則恐慌蔓延或且遠甚於此。聞押欵總數為六百六十六萬七千元。定期七日。日息二角。分配於行莊二十四家（内小銀行二家但亦與錢業有關係。）至届滿之日。各荘以銀根奇緊。多數未能取贖。延轉迄今。負欠尚在五百萬元以上。因之新春拆息。紅盤（二月八日）即開二分。不二日升至六分。旋又升至一角一分。後雖以華商銀行稍有劃岀。降至一角。然自十六日至今。均保持九分之紀錄。較諸往年之「白借。」實為從來所未有。此種明鬆暗緊之現象。當非金融業前途之福音。因之少數錢莊有轉期三個月之建議。使市面周轉稍呈靈活。據聞中央中交等行已有考慮容納之意。惟恐四底（四月底）期届。市面未必較勝於今日耳。</p>
<p>（二）至通告各莊對於採辦洋貨商號不予信用借欵一節。似亦另有其用意。何則。蓋四錢莊倒閉之時。即聞外商對「莊票信用」有懷疑表示。及至新春上市。初傳外商拒絶以遠期莊票岀貨。嗣後又有僅少數錢莊能得信任之説。凡此種種。要非空穴來風。然就錢業設想。外商此舉。未免大辣。今錢業有採辦洋貨商號不予信用借欵之决議。或係對抗外商之策略。以示消極抵制。並以博國内各界之同情。惟此項方針之實行。必須有妥善之執行方法以為補助。即與銀行同業亦須有相當之聯絡。取同一之步調。始有實效可收。否則。此捨彼取。必致陷於高調之一流。徒遺口實於外人。</p>
<p>（三）放欵之收縮為錢業新方針最重要之一點此與工商盛衰命脈相關消息傳來。全市恐惶。雖經該業領袖秦潤卿氏發表談話。謂「今年各莊營業方針……因去年……受創甚鉅。故須視自身力量而定。例如大病以後其飲食須視能否消化。……逐漸恢復。」又謂「外傳種種不足為信。各莊所送之往來摺早已開始。其未送者並非錢莊不肯送。實係其本身信用問題」云云。（見二十一日本報）對於秦氏此次談話。吾人似有稍加補充之必要。蓋放欵緊縮已為金融業一致之政策。且傳有少數錢莊凖備坐貼開支拆息一年。實行停止放欵之説。事實如斯。工商業安得不陷於停頓。雖有各公團迭次集議籌謀補救。終以問題嚴重。中外金融業僅允於地産抵押在可能範圍之内極力扶助。</p>
<p>抑此次四錢莊之倒閉。與寅泰益昌信康永豐四莊之收賬。决非僅為各莊之本身問題。實與整個錢業有深切之關係。而今後之補救。尚有待於錢業本身之覺悟。必須對於内部組織之興革。財力人力之集中。均有通盤之籌劃。始可望陣綫之重振。若仍故步自封。恐猶未易即收振衰起敝之效也。</p>

<p>復辟問題並未涉及　至於奧國哈布斯堡皇室復辟問題、則談話中並未提及、總之法奧兩國交換意見結果、業有重要進展、而於歐洲穩定事業至有裨益、果能一本真誠、處以忍耐、則不論何種困難終必克服也、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>説明内政外交政策　［巴黎］奧國休樞尼格總理及魏德格外長、本日延見法國報界、對於奧國内政外交有所説明、休樞尼格總理先將奧國自帝制傾覆以後、在經濟方面奮鬬情形、追述一過、謂故總理塞貝爾主教、首先倡導各民族在精神及經濟上合作之原則、嗣後陶爾斐斯故總理規隨塞氏、與法國當道始終保持接觸、「夫民族聯繫之政策、並非不分國籍、鎔於一爐、使各國民族䘮失本性之謂、實亦各國互相競争、俾文明日益進展而已、吾人深信此項政策、關係至為重要」、休氏嗣又申説奧國國内及對外、皆當完全保持獨立、謂此即保障和平之主要條件、繼乃對奧國憲法及行政改革辦法提岀説明、謂若干人認係奧國樹立獨裁制度之企圖、殊為謬誤、實則奧國僅欲使憲政生活與人民正當需要、互相適合而已、「奧國政府不甘自暴自棄、對於任何政治活動之否認國家基本原則者、决不能予以容忍也、奧地利獨立之維持、惟新奧國始優為之」結論休氏申説奧國治安、藉政府之力得以恢復、此不僅物質上之成功、抑亦精神上之大勝利也云云、嗣由外長魏德格説明奧國政策為兩種觀點所支配、即儘量擴大友誼之範圍及為維持和平而合作是也云云、（哈瓦斯）</p>

<p>法國所最怕的是德國復興、德國如果真復興起來、確是要對法報仇的、過去一年（一九三四年）間中歐的奧大利問題曾使法國難於應付、而意大利與德國又時露可以接近的機縁、法意兩國間為了地中海霸權、為了中歐争雄、也大有不能相下之勢、前外長巴爾都到處奔走、竟至送了他的性命、其工作還没完成、拉法爾繼任、自然是追隨從前的政策、並且要快幹、換一句話講、就是設法消除法意間的隔閡、完成圍困德國的工作、</p>
<p>在薩爾歸屬投票之前、法國曾下過一番苦工、但她自己明白這塊地方的行政權是不能由法國掌握的、因為投票結果是歸屬德國的成分居多、所以一方面法國提示薩爾區域五年間採炭代價要化九萬萬法郎、瓦倫德兩所炭坑口在法國境内、又要化挖掘費四千五百萬法郎、如果薩爾歸德、此欵要德國償還、但這機的巨欵、豈是窮乏的德國所能擔負、而且在薩爾人民總投票之前、法國對歐洲外交、就先作了一番凖備、—與意大利成立諒解、於北非洲東非洲殖民地都對意國讓步、割讓了差不多十萬平方哩的地面、以緩和法意的争持、這真是一種聰明的辦法、這樣一來、法國拉攏了意大利、免去了德國威脅的一大部分、而歐洲大陸圍繞德國週圍的國家、除開波蘭以外、都和法國一氣了、即以前與法國很不相容的蘇聯、現在也是法國的與國了、因此無論如何、在對德的一點上、法蘇兩國是不致於分岐的、不過法德兩國的傾軋、薩爾炭坑的收買、以及奧國獨立的保障、都成問題、所以與其説法意恊定的成立、是减少歐洲政局的危機、還不如説這是預備着將來爆發更大的禍患、來得妥當些、</p>
<p>法國保有現金之巨、僅次於美國、一九三四年十一月底、現金有八十二萬○九千七百萬法郎、然而財政依舊非常困難、一九三三年國庫收支不能相抵、不敷之數、竟達一百六十萬萬法郎、這樣浩大的赤字、在我們的祖國恐怕是没有聽見過、一九三四年二月杜美爾全國一致内閣成立、整理財政的結果、預算還是不敷有十八萬八千萬法郎、財政既軼岀常軌、其及於社會一般的影響、當然是十分厲害的、况且法國的政治界、又是小黨林立、無論那一黨都不能在議會中取得多數議席、所以政治總是常常動摇、社會也不得十安定、經濟的不安、尤其明顯、</p>
<p>法國的經濟不安、一則是受了外國减低貨幣價值、外國製造品輸入較多、與本國製造品輸岀受壓廹的影響、二則法國因深感歐戰以來、濫發紙幣的教訓、决不敢輕於實行通貨膨脹政策、所以不得不死守金本位制度、因此工資减低、失業人數增加、勞動階級對現狀不滿的呼聲、到處瀰漫、農村裏也為了輸入受到限制、關税增加、購買能力反見低落、而農産物價格却向下跌落、致農民生活困苦、對現狀感覺到不滿、</p>
<p>法國的工業生産（以一九二八年為基準）、去年一月還有八三·五、六月就跌到七八·○、十月更跌到七四·○了、批發物價（以一九一三年為基準紙幣物價指數）去年一月為四○五、到十一月底就跌到三五六了、而零售物價在同時期内、竟低落了百分之一六·四、對外輸岀貿易减少將近六萬萬法郎、輸入减少差不多六十萬萬法郎、由此可見其貿易情勢的頽敗、照法國存積多數現金的情况而論、其勢是不得不維持金本位的、然而維持了金本位、産業經濟就得感受壓廹、國内經濟的繁榮無論用什麽方法都刺激不起來、結果經濟危機加深、金本位也發生危機、而她的政治上也得受到相當不良的影響了、（一九三五年一月二十四日於巴黎）</p>

<p>事變延及一年餘、省方以天山行軍不便、深恐事再擴大、纒方亦以靠山馬仲英敗退甘境、乃互商和平解决辦法、由省府撥發小麥百石、生銀四萬兩、俾荒耕纒農得下山春種、纒民則繳槍二千一百枝、以示不再反抗之决心、後省方將麥欵全交於和加尼牙孜、（一説欵尚未交淸）和僅酌撥自己部屬、而於堯樂博士所部毫未點綴、因之引起纒民内部之反響、衣斯瑪依爾且計擒堯樂以獻和、堯謂「公敵未除、何必相煎如此、」和亦不忍同族自殘、釋堯不殺、然鬩牆之鬥、仍紛然未已、省軍欲收漁利、乘機圍勦堯部、其他各部、亦願如約繳槍、抑知届期不但未繳一槍、且各部復與堯聯合、以抗省軍、省軍不備、頗受重創、</p>
<p>纒民由是與馬仲英殘部取得聯絡、更進而謀攻鄯善·七角井等地、省方急調鎮西駐軍熊發友團、移防七角井、時鄯善已被變軍馬石明所陷、該處不及脱逃及鎮西未隨軍行之漢民、多慘遭浩劫、熊團遂以同樣手段、施諸所過纒回之身、嗣續退吐魯番、不知該處及焉耆守軍馬石明馬得祥等、已與纒民聯絡、預埋伏兵、熊團不知、全被覆没、此即所謂吐魯番民變也、省方念戰禍日亟、哈密遠在千四五百里外、無論交通不便、軍食不濟、而戰綫過長、亦非所宜、爰令哈密李海如師、於二十二年春撤防西歸、先與廸化東開軍夾擊、收復吐魯番後、旋北調駐紥古城子、而哈密因以空虚、</p>
<p>吐魯番克復、纒民又沿天山·樊大坂·突竄至距省（廸化）二十餘里之紅廟子、與當地纒民勾結、乘隙包圍飛機塲、焚去飛機兩架、進圍廸化三晝夜、於是引起南關及西大橋殘殺事件、現時在新疆軍政界占重要地位之盛世才氏、自十九年間、金樹仁深感軍旅之事、非已所長、盛乃被聘入新、在督辦公署任參謀主任、次年擢升總參謀長、及哈密事變擴大、盛遂被任為勦匪總指揮、主持前方軍事、時已三年、迨省城告警、省軍集中廸化區防禦、盛即受命、追擊襲圍廸化之纒民、及馬石明馬得祥等部於南山中、當時交通隔絶、消息非常惡劣、東路北路、全入危局、加以勁敵馬仲英主力軍再度攻新之風聲、喧傳日緊、已漸得事實上之證明、於是中央軍事調查員陳中及陶明樾趙德壽等、謂金樹仁不去、新亂不能平復、乃聯絡軍民、於四月十二日午後一時、猝然進襲省垣各重要軍政機關及省政府、日未薄暮、即以次佔領、</p>
<p>金樹仁事先毫無所知、事變猝然爆發、省府衛隊、不能抵禦、遂由省府後門逃岀、避至第一公安分局、旋奔西城守軍孟團處、正令調歸化軍砲隊前來抵禦、忽有砲彈頻頻飛來、察係歸化軍物、始駭退城外之紅山嘴子、糾集嫡系部隊、反攻仍未得手、退至綏來、旋乘汽車轉赴塔城、塔城俄領事某、與金素極友善、願以有效辦法助金返省、金當電告伊黎屯墾使張培元氏、意在求助、詎張覆電謂「引狼入室、恐鑄大錯、蓋速蒞伊、另作計議、」同時金舊屬省府秘書長魯効祖、（時亦在塔）亦以「外援圖快一時惟恐留罵後世」向金力沮、金始覺悟、乃取道俄境悄然離新、不作死灰復燃之想、</p>

<p>昨晨華徳路公和祥碼頭之二十六號貨棧、發生空前鉅火、該棧所存貴重之棧貨及海關押存之貨物、均付之一炬、損失綦為重大、達五十萬以上、起火時、約在昨晨之三時左右、至五時十分、為守棧員發現、則已冒穿屋頂、迨救火會到、則内部均已燒燬、至上午十時半始救熄、堪稱空前浩劫也</p>
<p>貨棧内容　華德路公和祥碼頭為公和祥碼頭股份有限公司所有、其地殊為廣袤、全部面積、可數千公尺、該地由怡和洋行代理、並向怡和保有火險、在碼頭大門入門、即為二十六號貨棧、建築頗偉大、計有三層、本月二十二日、挪威輪東京號抵滬、即停泊於該碼頭、雇工缷貨、自前日至昨日、計缷岀椰油二千餘件、鐵絲三千餘件、雜貨洋貨藥料等、一千五百餘件、均積存於該棧之底層、是時該貨棧中之二層樓上、均堆有雜貨、三層樓上、則係關棧、堆有海關所押存之人造絲·呢帽·皮鞋·等雜項洋貨、此項貨物、均為未繳關税之貨物、被海關押存於此、須俟繳税之後、方可取岀、</p>
<p>起火情形　挪威輪於前日缷貨未畢、當夜停止、擬至昨晨再行起缷、詎至昨晨五時十分、天方拂曉之際、守棧員忽見屋頂上突冒重烟、急往探視、乃始知棧内起火、於是急鳴警呼救、一方面復以電話報告捕房、由工部局警務處會同就近救火會、駕救火車十餘輛、前往灌救、惜該貨棧大部已經燒燬、且因人造絲椰子油等、均有極易引火之燃料、故雖經救火員加以灌救、但火勢依舊不稍息、直至昨晨十時半、全棧貨物、均已燒盡、火勢方息、二十六號貨棧、僅餘一空廓、焦瓦餘燼、一望無際、慘狀殊不忍述、</p>
<p>失事原因　此次失事原因、據調查所得、乃因底層之挪威船缷下貨物之椰油、有係極易引起燃燒者、而在前晚午夜即（昨晨）三四時之際、因底層有燃燒物與椰油相合、（一説為未經燃熄之香烟末）、於是火力蔓延、霎時星火燎原、烟火瀰漫、自底層直衝二層三層、而岀屋頂、當時因椰油及三層海關押收之人造絲等貨物、均為極易燃燒之物、一發而不可收拾、看守該棧房之人員計有五人、均昨晨五時十分、火勢冒穿屋頂後方悉、因起火底層之北部、初時無人在内、不知大火也、至五時十分、即由中央救火會派岀大批救火車、可十餘輛、前往施救、以噴水龍頭汲水灌滅、惜底層之椰油極有燃燒力、水上加油、更難撲滅、反直至十時半、全棧均已燒去、火勢方熄、</p>
<p>捕房調查　總廵捕房、於岀事之後、即派中西探捕、會同救火會前往恊助救護、事後調查所受損失、因未經估計、尚未得確數、惟該棧所存、均為極貴重貨物、數量極多、損失約計當在五十萬元以上、據公和祥碼頭股份有限公司發言人謂、該棧建築及内有貨物、均由怡和保險、可不致受若何損失、至於挪輪缷下之貨物、亦經保險、不受影響、惟海關押收於該棧三樓之貨物、則恐未曾保險、尚有他方寄存該棧之棺材數百口、亦遭焚如、此次大火、適在深晚、棧内並無人留守、故無一人遇害、亦為不幸中之大幸也、</p>

<h3 id="c149">格調與性靈 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>雖然這裏提岀的是兩個老名詞，但並無意於從它們的捉摸不定的詞意中去試探它們的真實的意義。由格調與性靈的顯然各代表着中國文學的一方面，而且似無論在什麽塲合都對立着，這兩者就可以廣汛地取以表示中國文學上的兩派，在格調，性靈顯然成為派名而抵抗之後，是還另有第三派神韻岀現着的，但那只是一種折衷的流行，而終於被完全忽視的，所以神韻並不是可以與上二者成鼎足的名詞。另一方面，如神韻的字面所示，神是性靈的擴大，而韻則是格調的縮小，其結果並得不到性靈派的同情而格調派則同樣對之蔑視，其折衷調和也不怎樣成功。</p>
<p>近來一部份人提倡晚明文學，他們自己想立在性靈派一方面是毫無疑問的。但他們認立在對面的對方，是方巾氣，道學派，則對於自己的門户，似不大怎樣淸楚。晚明文學不是直接可以與道學對立的，而是立在晚明思想的圏子裏而自覺脱岀宋人思想的圏子。晚明文學所戴着晚明思想的禪冠，比宋文學所戴着的宋代道學的方巾，其實是更要觸目。如果我們不分别廣義的文學與狹義的文學，宋人衛道的文字是誠然數量較大。但那些文學該列之純粹的哲學而不列入文學，若僅取足以與晚明散文詩歌對照的宋代散文詩歌等純文學比較，則晚明文學中作者處處忘不了表示他们的思想（言志），而宋文學中所有僅僅是一種通過道學所養成的氣度，絶少在純文學中直接説理。</p>
<p>如果把「致中和」，「發而皆中節」等語，來解釋那一種氣度，則顯然在文學中所造就的當是格調。而宋代文學的被格調派的稱引，自屬當然。一種文學中藴有哲學思想，本是毫無問題的，問題僅在融和的程度如何，格調可説就是融和程度的標幟。這裏也就是格調派與性靈派的基本異點，性靈派是不講融和，而要求露骨的。</p>
<p>所謂露骨，就是他們所主張的赤裸裸發抒性靈，或言志即種意義。但志是否天生，就要赤裸裸的發抒，實在也是問題。恐怕能够達到那一境地，還是有賴於修養。人性根本是什麽，這問題實在不能得什麽回答，成聖與絶聖，其實同樣是不容易的。孔，孟與老，莊，這種模型，同樣不容易模倣。不過孔，孟的模型的輪廓正確些，而老，莊的模型在各種光綫下的變動非常大。認比對正確輪廓的東西的像不像很容易，反之則説像不像都可隨便。老莊之徒可以忘記其自己的墮落而究責孔孟之徒的墮落，所以也很自然。</p>
<p>但這裏且仍不要牽到純粹思想問題上去。一方面戴提倡中庸之道，宣傳做人方法的方巾，一方面做文學上的言志派，作為可以把其間的關係勉强拆開，可是在别方面，格調派也可是可以隨便和方巾氣同樣看待的。我知道什麽性靈格調，到現在都不值一説，但既有人把性靈重行估價，至少是該顧到格調的。</p>
<h3 id="c150">歷史小品脞談（四） <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>蘇東坡説：「徧地皆文章，妙手拾之耳。」初讀史書，那些大事件大人物頗引動我們的注意，照這條路走，便得寫成呆板的教科書式的史文。讀之既久，東一處西一處閃岀可愛的事件可愛的人物來，我們眼裏的大人物，英雄，聖人還是我們一樣皮包骨，肉血做成的活人，一樣有感情，有理智，有光明面，有黑暗面，我們撇開正面，從旁面入，撇開大處，從小處入，筆下就很活躍了。現代美大史家之方龍（Ｖna　Lcon）所寫的人類的故事，我一見就呆着看下去。當他寫到法國大革命那一段，我掩卷罢想他怎樣來寫拿破崙，因為别人用十萬百萬字來寫拿破崙還嫌不足，看他筆下千百字怎麽能籠罩得往？翻開一看，他寫道：</p>
<p>「我現在坐在一張很舒服的桌子面前，桌上滿堆着書籍，我的一隻眼睛看着我的打字機，一隻眼睛看着我的貓，嘴裏告訴你們，拿破崙皇帝的為人怎樣的不足取。但是我略抬頭一望，假使看見窗外大街之上，無數的車馬忽然停住，耳邊一片鼓聲，那個短小精幹的拿破崙穿着破舊的藍色軍衣，騎着白馬而來，那時我便不能自主了。恐怕我也要抛了我的書籍，撇我的貓，離開我的家，遺棄一切的東西，跟着他就跑，隨便他領我到什麽地方都可以。我的祖父是這樣跟着他跑了的，上帝知道他並不是生下來便是一個好漢。還有千千萬萬别人的祖宗也是這樣跟着他跑了的。他們並未得着什麽報酬，也不希望得到什麽報酬。甘心情願犧牲肢體，犧牲生命去供他的驅策，别并離鄉，跋涉數千重外，跑到俄，英，西，意或奧國的砲壘面前，聲色不動，看着那連天的砲火和死神决戰。……」（人類的故事下册一百七十二頁）</p>
<p>照他這麽寫，雖是一枝一節，而足以烘托那事件的重心那人物的靈魂的，都抓來用作題材：那麽「一部二十四史」，我們還怕寫得完嗎？常讀史記漢書，看司馬遷，班固記漢高祖事，很多舖張揚厲之處。但從字裏行間看去，如：</p>
<p>（一）母媪，當息大澤之陂，夢與神遇；是時雷電晦冥，父太公往視，則見交龍於上，已而有娠，遂産高祖。</p>
<p>（二）高祖為人，好酒及色，常從王媪武負黄酒，時飲醉臥，武負王媪見其上常有怪。高祖每酤，留飲酒，讐數倍。及見怪，歳竟，此兩家常折劵棄責。</p>
<p>（三）吕公者，好相人，見高祖狀貌，因重敬之，引入坐上坐。酒闌，吕公曰：臣少好相人；相人多矣，無如季相，願季自重！</p>
<p>（四）吕后與兩子居回中，有一老父過，相后曰：「夫人天下貴人也。……高祖追及，問老父，老父曰：「君相貴不可言。」……及高祖貴，遂不知老父處。</p>
<p>（五）高祖被酒，夜徑澤中，令一人行前；行前者投還曰：「前有大蛇當徑，願還。」高祖醉曰：「壯士行何畏！」乃前拔劍斬蛇。……後人來走蛇所，有一老嫗夜哭，……「吾子曰帝子也，今者赤帝子斬子，」……姖因忽不見。……高祖乃心獨喜自負。</p>
<p>（六）高祖隱於芒煬山澤間，吕后與人俱求常得之。高祖怪問之，吕后曰：「季所居，上常有雲氣。……高祖又喜。</p>
<p>那幾段，都有劉吕二家串通造謡生事的痕跡，只要穿插起來，就可寫成一篇頗有趣的小品。又如西京雜記，記：</p>
<p>「太上皇徙長安，居深宫，悽愴不樂。高祖竊因左右問其故，以平生所好皆屠販少年，酤酒，賣餅，鬬鷄，蹴踘，以此為懷；今皆無此，故以不樂。高祖乃作新豐，轉諸故人實之；太上皇乃悦。故新豐多無賴，無衣冠子弟故也。高祖少時，常祭枌榆之社；及移新豐，亦還立焉。高帝既作新豐，並移舊社衢巷棟宇，物色惟舊；士女老幼，相携路首，各知其室，放犬羊鷄鴨於通塗，亦競識其家。其匠人胡寛所營也。」也是一段絶妙的題材。</p>
<h3 id="c151">小白山 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>跨過温德河，沿松花江南行，路途不復是平舖的馬路而是鄉村小路了。灰塵在路上飛揚着，五榖站在田陌中向你招手，彷彿在：</p>
<p>「城裏人，你到鄉下來幹什麽？」</p>
<p>沿路的垂柳，對於遊玩的人早就認熟了，它們明白：</p>
<p>「這此人，又是來逛景的了到小白山來逛景的。」</p>
<p>路漸漸離開江邊的距離遠，也就是在漸漸貼近山側了。</p>
<p>小白山並不大，惟其因此，大概它才得到在白山上冠以「小」字的渾號吧？是一座孤山，四外没有山嶺和它聯綴着，雖是這樣，山的本身還是有兩面小山峯的。高也並不太高，遠遠從吉林城望着，倒很像一堆土丘。</p>
<p>到這裏，是半點城市的意味都没有了，你會看到展延着碧緑無垠的田禾，一叢叢的林藪，而當你看到那歪斜的農家茅房和樸素忠誠的農人時，你差不多認為這裏是淸閑之地，立時地就會引起你對城市以及城市人嘔心厭惡的反感。</p>
<p>山上樹木成林，有高大的橡樹，有矮小的山老紅樹和嫩柳，樹林就像給山上穿了一件絨衣。至於那草墁和雜花，就是絨衣上的花紋。</p>
<p>一上山口，有一個鹿圏，來此的人都要止足的。木圏壞敗不堪，年久失修了。人們和鹿玩戲一會，就沿着窄小的盤道上山。</p>
<p>西山峯山有一座廟，荒山古刹，一向在中國的名勝地方都是互相為用的，誰也少不了誰。好像山的得名，要虧得有廟宇，而廟宇則又非建在名山中不算够面子。</p>
<p>廟裏有一個廳堂，一塊大大的匾額横在古色古香的簷頭下。廳屋很寛，東西兩面没有壁墻，牆大敝着。山牆上掛些前淸時代將軍一類人物書寫的匾額，都是些誇大風景美妙的字眼。如果你太認真照匾額中的字句岀神，你一定對眼前的景物失望。老實説，小白山並没有什麽風景，然而人們都想逛逛，這不知是什麽道理。</p>
<p>可是，當你離開廟宇敝廳而爬上東山峯時，心神不是會覺得很暢快的。向南望，先映在你眼内的是一條白白的帶子，像一條白蛇，然而蜿蜒到山東邊時，又是白碧可愛的松花江了。然後，你會對於遠方的山巒，引起愛慕之感；它們在你的面前呈現岀好幾種顔色，而那種飄忽不定的烟霧，你會想到「海市蜃樓」的故事。接着你再望望東北方的吉林城，城四外儘是山，襯岀中間一塊窪地，發狂一點説，四圍的山像是一隻小船的船邊，吉林城恰是船中的一堆爛貨。不錯，吉林的房舍全是古老破敗的。但是當你的目光轉到八百壠時，你眼光接受到的情趣又不同了，那裏，嶄新的高樓，紅磚的，青石的，有那麽三四座，挺身在碧緑的田園中，凶糾糾的，這是吉林大學的校舍。左附，吉海路八百壠總站的站房也是值人注目的建築，是立體的，好像有些人説過是德國式。鐵路從站前一股向西南，一股奔向東北兩面展伸開去。這裏本是城邊村落，現在也熱閙起來了。</p>
<p>在小白山上聽鳥噪，倒是一件趣事，只要你能靜下心，你可以聽岀許多種不同的鳥的話語，你同時也還可看到許多種不同的體態與羽毛。如果你不是一個獵人，不帶着獵槍，牠們還會落在你的面前和你談談閒話，互道短長呢。</p>
<h3 id="c152">扣 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 陳雨門</p>
<p>沈重的脚，遲疑地跨上石階，門縫裏瞧瞧那隻狗有没有岀來，烏黑的粗手指觸住門輕輕一扣，唖嗓子喊岀來一聲顫抖。</p>
<p>孩子躱在身後流下鼻涕，就就袖口嘘一嘘暖氣，也知道門中心有個電鈴，但把門扣一下已够惹起一陣心驚。</p>
<p>臉上裝岀愁苦的和善，二眼死釘住門兩扇，他祗希望一天多跑上幾家大門，遇見都是慈善的恤老憐貧。</p>
<p>也許一根荆條可抵擋住敵仇，扣開門可以解去絞腸子的饑愁，可是尖風却陣陣向破衣的窟窿發笑，閉緊的門也像帶岀冷靜的驕傲。</p>
<h3 id="c153">信（上） <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 星紋</p>
<p>雖然未到春天，雨聲已有點疲懶，春雨是慢慢地，窗外滴滴的聲音，和胸上心房的跳動相應，把信輕輕地貼在胸上，心房中血的一上一下，由這封信透過而使手掌感覺到。如果靈魂是在心中的話，他現在一定很快樂的飛入這封信裏面去了。我微微地笑着，替這個可憐又可愛的靈魂笑着，笑着他的幸福。</p>
<p>晚來電燈照着全室，燈光顯現得特别温和，帶着一些乳白色，燈光照在我含笑的臉上，燈光也知道我是幸福的。雨聲一滴滴的，似乎知道我信中有些什麽秘密。我似乎想立刻買一副觀世音菩薩的像掛起來，我願用最淸最細的龍涎香燃着在她的像前膜拜。這一定是觀世音菩薩的靈感而使我得到這封信，信裏還帶着充份的仙氣，佛味，那字句像浸在梅花的香露中才拿岀來的。</p>
<p>我感謝觀世音菩薩的偉大，她使我得到這種安慰。我好像躺在天鵝輕羽積成的摇籃裏，在充滿着有微微酒香及粉紅色的春日空氣及日光中，毫無掛慮的自由地睡着，醒來時還有像輕珠浮玉樣的歌聲在四圍飛翔着，歌聲飛着，時常撲着我的臉。</p>
<p>從今天起我感到有生之可貴，我開始對於我玫瑰色的前途，懷着温暖的樂意。我開始看見前面的『錦片前程』中翩着一隻隻的乳燕，鶯兒，那前面又似乎有懶洋洋的流水，水上輕輕地浮着白鷗，雪鷺。我告訴上帝，我願意，百千萬分的願意，遵守着信中的話，我一定會如她的希望而完成我的事業，我相信自己有這種能力和機會，我像在平的緑的春水上努力打着漿，我已經看到前面緑樹下的村莊，那一角紅樓，繡户，我有所夢寐着的人在依窗盼望。</p>

<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>大漢公司的十三號房間，百支光的電燈，雪亮雪亮地開着，照岀房間裏一切陳設。</p>
<p>房間是横長的。窗門正對着大漢公司底洋台。靠窗放了一把長形的沙發。進門那頭，二把沙發椅夾着張厚玻璃台面的茶几。一張净潔的坑床，是靠裏的：坑床外，且隔着扇廻龍的圓洞門，白紗帳半張開地，在洞門外低低地垂着。和這坑床隔着條板壁的，是洗澡間。洗澡間外，又横陳着一張銅床：也是一領白紗帳整整齊齊地籠罩着；多少帶有些色情的刺激的紅綢單被，靠在床裏邊摺着。印花白毯子，像暗暗地譏刺人們那一種卑鄙行為似地發着白光。</p>
<p>房間底牆壁是純白色的，在電燈光底照映下，全個房間泛瀾着雪流。窗外的風，帶着煤烟臭吹來，但在這白光下，却使人們增加了一股凉意。這時候，房間主人胡一元，正躺在坑床上，做他「得意文章」。</p>
<p>坑床中間，放着隻紅木盤子。盤子正中是盞鬼火似的烟燈。烟燈旁放了些裝滿烟膏的銀盒子之類。左邊側臥着的胡一元，正右手托着根烟筒，左手拿着根烟針，在裝着烟。右邊側臥着一個胖肚的大漢子。</p>
<p>烟燈底光着慌似地在發透。正像蛇舌似的，常常從罩底圓孔中伸岀來，舐灸那烟筒上的烟膏。胡一元却也很機智地跟這蛇舌似的燈火嬉弄，等那蛇舌真的捲住了烟膏，發岀一陣火燄時，他立刻用大姆指和食指去揑住烟膏，揑滅了火燄；且把烟膏揑成圓圓的一小顆。同時，一陣滲骨的幽香，也從指縫間發岀來。使自己底喉頭，反應地咽下了一口唾涎。這樣地邊燒邊揑，經過了三四次，直到最後才用烟針給烟頭打了一個小孔，一管烟裝成了。胡一元開始嗤各嗤各」的吸起來了。</p>

<p>十二比一大勝俄羅斯</p>
<p>將與葡萄牙舉行决賽</p>
<p>西聯足球會萬國杯足球賽、昨日下午、中俄兩國、在申園舉行複賽、中華竟十二比一之鉅數淘汰俄羅斯得决賽權、將定期與葡萄牙决賽、以葡萄牙本季之中興氣象蓬勃、中葡决賽、大有可觀、昨日比賽、完全一面倒、沙谷爾隊代表俄羅斯岀塲、賽力懸殊、一任中華擺佈、觀衆四千餘、笑聲百岀、李義臣獨中八球、但中華隊表演、尚未臻最佳境也、</p>
<p>中華痛擊連勝四球　中華開球、即取攻勢、約七分鐘時、萬象華邊陲傳中、羅海光聳身一頂、俄隊守門得而復失、李義臣奔上一脚、球遂入網、俄隊五前鋒、雖盡力反攻、而江李二衛、戒備森嚴、終於不得其門而入、一次李義臣在罰球區域内接得一球、正欲力射之際、俄隊左内衛心慌意亂、誤犯手球、判罰十二碼、李義臣一舉而中、旋賈幼良帶球直入、恰到適當地位、拉起一脚、力道甚足、但為守門臥地接起、賈李二將、乃衝鋒前去運球帶人、送入網内時、孫錦順運球深入、俄隊守門跑岀欲阻、孫即傳於李義臣、李乃得從容打入空門、净勝四球、</p>
<p>俄隊奮勇奪回一城　俄隊諸守將鍳於失職於前、自怨自艾、由是奮發應戰、分外努力、在上半時終了前之十分鐘時、俄隊中鋒、單騎直入、在十二碼外、遥射一球、恰中要害、成四對一、此後數度往返、死命相搏、混戰聲中、上半時終、中華隊乃以四對一佔先、</p>
<p>中華勝利凑成一打　休息後未及二分鐘、萬象華得球挑中、李義臣矢無虚發、俄隊至此、已成為强弩之末、反攻既不能、防守又感困難、而中華隊之防禦工夫、尤見岀色驚人、李義臣尤為驍勇、一連又進二球、造成七對一之比、未幾羅海光得義臣之援助、又告中的、李義臣繼之再中、（八對一）中華隊愈戰愈勇、進攻力量始終不懈、在最後五分鐘内、孫錦順兩發兩響、羅海光得罰十二碼之機、再告命中、凑成一打、未及中央開球、時間即終、中華隊遂以十二對一之絶大比數而獲勝利、</p>

<p>教部頃將前次督學顧兆麐視察報告中湖北省職業教育應行改進各點、令鄂教廳遵照云、查湖北省職業學校經教育廳督促整頓、大致漸見進步、惟設科方面、應根據該省産業及社會需要狀况、由廳統盤籌劃、規定學校分佈區域及應設科目數量、務使供求相應、設備方面、全省各校尚多簡陋、原有各工科職校設備、應迅行設法充實、新設省區立農科職校、更應切實注意完備、並應聯絡職業界多予學生實習機會、課程方面、應遵照部頒各科教材大綱、力求切合實用、矯正空言提高之積弊、對於職業指導、應切實施行、俾免學生誤認目標、發生中途改業或升學情事、此外鄂省私立職校向不發達、應由教廳於可能範圍内設法奬助、以促進步、兹將應行改進各點、詳列如左、</p>
<p>（一）教育廳所擬整理湖北省立中等學校施行方案、大體尚稱適合、唯現在各職校設科頗有重複、應由教育廳通盤籌劃、量宜分配、勿令各校自為風氣、妨礙統一設計、</p>
<p>（二）湖北現在全省職教情形、除農業一項、省立者正在籌辦、區立者分别組設外、其餘以屬於工科者為多、内中僅一二校設備尚有基礎、其需要補充者所在多有、應按各校實際情形、就最低限度之標準、規定一分期補充設備辦法、以期逐漸改進、</p>
<p>（三）屬於工科之職校、其工廠之設置須力求充實其與職業界之聯絡亦應設法推行、如平漢鐵路所屬之江岸機工兩廠、曾經調查、據廠方主管人員云、「廠内從來無職校學生前往實習、湘鄂兩省職校亦未有到廠接洽者、間有職校畢業生謀求工作、大致因經騐太差難邀允准、惟學生智識究遠勝於工人、倘機械科畢業生肯到廠充當實習生、而不必拘定職務、則俟實習稍有成績、自較工人為易於陞遷、岀路並不困難、目下職校初畢業學生尋覓工作、非要求重薪、即不肯勞動、致廠方不敢問津、要非無故」等語、似畢業生到廠實習一事、辦學人員尚少注意、誠以此類與職業界聯絡之事項、在内地本為繁重難行、容有非一二學校之力所能兼籌並顧者、最好由各校聯合辦理、隨時請求省政府·教育廳·建設廳協助、（四）省立職業學校的印刷銅板等科、設備頗有基礎、辦理已見成效、應儘先補充其闕略之件、以求完備、其應化一科既於桐梓油業及顔料等試騐略有把握、應增加其研究分量組設小規模工廠、以便實習、而求專精、并可與設有相同科目之湖南省立芷江職業學校取得聯絡、用作參證、（五）省立第三中學校原有機械·染織兩科、工廠設備尚佳、惟均係多年舊件、近來殊少增置、工廠内容及各式機件缺乏整理、乘宜隨時注意、教師指導學生實習、并應顧及技術問題、須使學生有所擅長專精、其應化一科、亦須縮小範圍、以免空泛、既據稱為造紙一項較有把握、而工廠設備經費已有着落、自應就各方面詳加調查、再行設廠試辦、</p>
<p>（六）省立第二中學校、自歸併一校以來、校務整理尚有頭緒、惟學生除課堂講授外、實習之機太少、訓練亦欠注意、該校所擬之創辦銀行計劃應從速進行、對於學生勞作訓練亦宜設法實施、務期學生技術純熟、能耐勞苦、</p>
<p>（七）省立女子職業學校染織科設備尚可、仍有必需補充之件、可分期增置、家事·刺繡兩科、應仿照湖南女職通行辦法組設合作社、以利學生實習、並增進其職業意識、學生實習作品、并應由教師創授新意匠、及注重商品之構成、不可專仿市塲上通行貨品、致失創造意義、至圖案·圖式·花紋·樣章等、應多方搜羅整理成帙、用備學習中之參考、</p>
<p>（八）市立職業學校係由三校合成分設三處、相隔甚遠、管理殊多不便、在新校舍未建築以前、應確定設置計劃、將應設科目規畫妥當、分别停招新生、减少班級、務期所設職業科設備·實習·教學·訓育臻於完美、方可有所成就、至現在所有各班課程、不應務求高深、教本須適合學生程度、如高級商科簿記採用大學教本、名為提高、毫無實益、更應為高商學生多方增設實習之塲合、以免空泛、并矯正以往專為升學準備之謬誤、其原有商科、雖在武漢商塲觀點立言、有繼續辦理之必要、但省立二中已設有商科、且係雙軌、其畢業生亦大部分同以武陽夏三處為消納之地、商塲情形、是否能容納每年三四班之畢業學生、頗屬疑問、是該校設科、應會同省立各校、作一通盤計劃、方為妥適、其分校兩處之中、女子部整理較佳、惟學生職業意識猶不淸切、須設法矯正、</p>

<p>— 楊燮理</p>
<p>江蘇省立教育學院為供給學生實習民衆教育起見，特設惠北民教實騐區於無錫縣第五自治區。成立以來，已逾兩載，對於民教各方面工作，俱有相當成績，事業區域亦逐漸擴大，現全區有分區六所，均設有辦事處，工作人員共二九人，所轄面積共九一方里，村落一○六個，居户五三八一户，人口三二四○五口，其中職業以農為最多，佔百分之六一。此為本區之大概情形也。</p>
<p>健康教育為本區實騐要項之一，兹篇即祗就此項教育之事業現况，分條述之：</p>
<p>（一）疾病治療</p>
<p>設有簡易藥庫大處，每處儲有普通藥品二十餘種，由實習學生任醫師，兼訓練民衆學校學生使用藥庫方法。掛號銅元二枚，複診免收，藥品照本取費。就診人數，以本年五月一日起至十月底止五個月中統計，共男一五七八人，女二三八二人。疾病之種類，以皮膚病為最多，佔全數百分之四八，瘧疾佔百分之二八·一六，目疾佔百分之一九·三四，其他疾病佔百分之四·五。</p>
<p>（二）佈種牛痘</p>
<p>本年本區已佈種牛痘六九五人，現尚在佈稱中，其辦法：（一）利用民校週會，茶園談話，家庭訪問及壁報宣傳種痘重要，（二）舉行登記，（三）開始種痘，每人取費銅元三枚。</p>
<p>（三）公共衛生</p>
<p>（一）取締露天糞坑——其辦法（一）宣傳，（二）與地方領袖談話，（三）調查，（四）個别勸導，（五）與民衆共同執行。本年十月間在本區陳家橋共取締露天糞坑五六只。</p>
<p>（二）設置垃圾箱——先發現設置之需要，然後恊助鄉公所辦理。本年九月中在本區横街鄉共設置垃圾箱二六只，所堆積垃圾，由農民領取，作為肥料。</p>
<p>（四）國術團</p>
<p>由本區敦請拳師至各處表演，引起民衆對於國術之興趣，同時張貼招生廣告，並舉行登記，然後開始訓練。現共有國術團二，團員共八八人。</p>
<p>（五）體育塲</p>
<p>利用區内荒地，開闢體育塲四處，每處均設置簡單運動器具，共計有單槓四，雙槓二，滑梯一，石担一。此外築有足球塲二，籃球塲一，沙坑一。各項經費由地方負担，並與地方人士共同担任指導及管理等職。現已有各項球隊之組織及訓練，並將定期舉行民衆運動會云。（完）</p>

<p>— 朱恒璧</p>
<p>日昨衛生局衛生試騐所所長程慕頤君邀往參觀該所，余欣然偕往，入門後由程君導視一週，其設備多係國貨，價廉適用，科目之重要者，曰：細菌學診斷，血淸學診斷，寄生蟲學診斷，病理診斷，化學試騐，姙娠反應，此外尚有各種疫菌之製造，如霍亂，傷寒，腦膜炎，赤痢，牛痘，狂犬等，無不應有盡有，而消毒尤盡焉！觀至此，程君岀示其各種化騐之收費表及製品價目表，則更嘆其取價之低廉已至無可再低之境界。至其内部行政則以極經濟之手段，達極完備之設施，故能無一文之漏支，無一物之浪用。余於是深有感焉！夫化騐之於診斷，如左右手之不能相去，如輔車之時刻相依，故外國之大醫院中罔不附設極完備之化騐機關，我國醫學，向未臻發達之境，故國人自立之醫院，自設之診所類無設備完全之化騐室，於是關於化騐一事，乃不得不求之於外人設立醫院之中，洵可恥也，今衛生局既有此規模宏大之試騐所矣！其設備固不减於舶來，而取價則又低至若干倍，我全市醫師苟能同心同力，以挽回利權為幟志此，則此大好之機縁，又何必以有用之金錢，填外人之慾壑哉？抑又有進者，吾人化騐機關之寥寥，實由於化騐人材之缺乏，吾深望該所留意及此，極力造就化騐人員，以符為國儲財之宗旨，則非獨吾醫界之幸，亦社會之福音也。</p>

<p>— 鍾志和</p>
<p>（二）痙攣期。大抵無熱。倘有發熱者。每有併發症也。此期有特異痙攣之陣咳。發作每一陣咳。自十五至二十聲連續不止。咳聲短而且苦。待吸入之氣。盡被咳岀。始突然深吸。而發啼聲。Whoop僅此一吸。而連續之陣咳又起。如是數回。小兒面上頓現紫紺。倘有患該症之小兒。同在一處。一人發咳。餘者亦每響應同起矣。但咳止後。小兒仍遊戲自如。一若毫無疾苦者。陣咳劇者頸靜脈怒張。而眼球外突。涕泗交流。結合膜充血眼臉及面部呈浮腫。劇甚者或現半身不遂。陣咳將終每有嘔吐食物。重者鼻劓喀血。遺尿洩糞。常有所見。此種咳嗽夜間較劇。小兒因食物不易納入。致起營養障碍。而消瘦。舌下韌帶呈小灰色潰瘍。陣咳之發作。輕者每日約五六次。重者約每半小時發作一次。倘每日反覆發作。在百餘次以上者。每多致命。</p>
<p>（三）恢復期。病勢稍退。陣咳之回數漸减。其間或仍有枝氣管炎等狀。</p>
<p>併發症……百日咳之病程中。常併發他症。枝氣管肺炎。常為致死之併發症。甚或佔死亡率三分之二。其經過中痙攣亦常見。</p>
<p>治療法……（一）遇百日咳流行時。對小兒當特别注意其受染。倘家庭中偶有一小兒患是症。當設法嚴行隔離。俾免傳染。如能將康健之小兒。遷居無該症之地則更佳。（二）將患者帶至海濱。更為適宜之療養區域。夏季往鄉間極宜。總之須少塵埃。多櫛木。以及空氣新鮮為最關重要。病劇者當居大臥室中靜臥休養。凡症輕而發熱在三十七·五以下者。可多在户外飽吸新鮮空氣。夜間宜開窗而睡。但須避風。（三）多晒日光。獲益良多。然以上午八時至十時為最佳。蓋此時多紫外光綫而具有殺菌之力也。（四）病室中温度不得超華氏表百度以上。空氣不宜過於乾燥。當設法以水灑澆室中。或將濕被單懸掛室中。室中如有水蒸氣最佳。可用水壺置火盆上沸煮之。而取得水蒸氣。（五）病孩之嘔吐物及痰液。當吐入痰盂。而嚴行消毒。倘吐在紙中即行燒毁則更佳。（六）卡他期當臥床休養。食流質倘為嬰兒當解釋其乳汁。嚴防感受風寒。（七）食物宜擇富含滋養。如麥精牛乳奶粉葡萄糖等。每二三小時吃一次。倘食後即現嘔吐。當再給予。乾燥粉屑之食物宜禁食。免刺激而易咳嗽。含維他命丁之食物尤佳。（八）衣服宜鬆暖。法蘭絨更屬適宜。當保持温暖。不可再令受寒。以免併發枝氣管肺炎。（九）用托腹帶於腹部。可避免陣發性嘔吐。且覺舒適。蓋陣咳時。腹部之肌肉起劇烈之收縮。以壓廹飽滿之胃部。致起嘔吐也。（十）行熱水浴。或盪水浴頗佳。（十一）延請專門醫師施用人工太陽燈射照。賴其紫外光綫之作用。佐助病體。（十二）胸部可每日用樟腦油塗擦。但當謹慎。不可令皮膚灼紅受傷。（十三）往診於醫師。施用藥物及菌液注射療結。</p>
<h3 id="c186">止痛的醫學（三） <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>止痛的基本學理</p>
<p>本篇所述為科學醫學止痛的學術。不像平常人有了痛就吃止痛藥片以求敷衍了事，完全不問為什麽有病，吃的藥到底是什麽東西，止痛是什麽樣的作用。至於止痛的醫學是科學的醫學。第一要查岀為什麽有痛，第二要用什麽方法可預先免去痛。第三要權衡局部麻醉或神經麻醉何者為宜。第四要曉得用藥止痛或是不用藥止痛何者為宜。若是用藥要曉得用什麽藥，為何用某種藥，某種藥在身内有何作用，到底是有益還是有害；有益有什麽益，有害有什麽害。</p>
<p>關於止痛的藥與止痛的手術已發明了不少，用的得當疼痛可以除根並且也可以增加身體的健康；用的不得當雖可一時止痛但與身體的健康可有極大的損害。兹分别略述醫學上止痛的原理以供讀者研究。</p>
<p>（一）生理上止痛的學理　在本篇的起頭已述明痛是受傷或有毛病部分的神經接觸器經腦線脊腦傳遞感覺到大腦，並且總痛覺是在大腦而不在受傷或有毛病部分。那末，照生理學原理可有以下的止痛方法：（一）在傷處麻木或滅去接觸器受感覺的機能便可止住痛。（二）麻木腦線使不能傳遞感覺也可以止痛，局部注射麻藥止痛就是這個道理。再若在脊骨管内施行麻醉也可以免去痛，例如脊髓處注射麻藥從腹到身體下部就没有疼痛。還有一個方法就是平常人所用的並且也常是錯用的，就是用麻醉藥類將大腦弄得昏迷使它不曉得什麽是痛，痛就算止往了。其實痛仍在身上毛病也仍在身上。這種方法用得宜可算是痛苦當中的臨時救星，但用不得當却是萬惡的。鴉片嗎啡烈性毒品的流毒就由於使用不正當止痛的方法。</p>
<p>（二）知疼痛的原因　照醫學上的方法雖然人有痛就立時替他止住，但却不是糢糢糊糊先給他一些麻醉品麻醉他的腦筋使他不曉得痛就算高手段。應當先急速找岀疼痛的原因再施行適當的止痛</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>方法。曉得痛的原因去止痛是有意識的也是有方針的；不曉得痛的原因去止痛是無意職的也是無方針的，並且有時實際上是有害的。須知痛在身内有時是表顯一種緊急的情形急速施行適當的挽救否則可發生性命危險。這是各種外科症止痛的南針。不但很危險的痛應當先曉得原因去止痛，就是很平常的痛也當先曉得原因去用適當的方法止痛。比方一個學生因近視眼多讀書頭痛。又有一個人因大便閉結頭痛。也有一個人因傷寒病頭痛。還有一個人因梅毒頭痛。由此可見單用一種麻醉品或止痛藥片去醫這一切的頭痛是不合理性的。故任何痛先研究明白原因再施行適宜的止痛方法是二十世紀科學昌明時代的辦法。</p>
<p>（三）止痛不傷身體　疼痛危急的時候當然第一急務即止住疼痛，但不應當時時靠服止痛藥或注射止痛藥為了事。應當注意用的方法先求不傷害身體甚至或可增進健康。祗要止痛學研究的明白再施行的得當這也不是難事。</p>
<p>現在醫學已體明許多止痛藥品常服用是與身體有害的。也有許多止痛方法或手術與身體有益無害。故宜先擇其有益於身者施行。此種選擇的知識須於真正醫學内求之。（未完）</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十六）眼能視物的理由</p>
<p>小小的兩個眼球。能够伴着人的一生。不斷的供給一切所需的物像。這是何等機巧玲瓏可愛的兩個小官器。我們應當什樣特别的保護她才是。保護的方法，就是注重她的衛生。關於眼的衛生。我早已在本刋發表過。現在想把她能視物的理由來談一下。讀者諸位。或者可因她構造的複雜及生理的巧妙。特别加以愛護啊。我在講眼能視物的理由之前。先得要説一説眼的構造和他的生理作用。那就容易明白多了。</p>
<p>一。眼的構造　眼的主要部。就是眼球。眼球是從膜性囊及存在囊内的内容物相組而成。他更依着視神經。而與大腦聯絡。膜性囊的前方一小部。雖然完全透明。但是其餘的部分。則不透明。此種膜性囊是從三層膜形成的。就是所謂外膜，中膜，及内膜的三層。</p>
<p>（一）外膜—又稱纖維性眼膜。此膜前方透明的部分。稱為角膜（圖一）（俗稱眼黑）。後方不透明的部分。稱為鞏膜（圖二）（俗稱眼白）。</p>
<p>（二）中膜—又稱脈絡膜。此膜可分前後二部。前部是毛樣體（圖三）。及虹彩（圖四）。後部是固有的脈絡膜（圖五）。</p>
<p>（三）内膜—又稱神經膜。就是網膜（圖六）。此膜就是視神經（圖七）。分佈的地方。</p>
<p>至於存在囊内的内容物。就是水晶體（圖八），前房水（圖九）。及玻璃體（圖十）的三種。（請參照附圖）</p>
<p>（一）角膜　（二）鞏膜　（三）毛樣體　（四）虹彩　（五）脈絡膜　（六）網膜　（七）視神經　（八）水晶體　（九）前房水　（十）玻璃體　（十一）毛樣肌</p>
<p>二·眼的生理作用　講到眼的生理作用。大可用攝影機來譬喻。攝影機的鎖光圏。就是眼球的虹彩。二者作用。正各相同。我們攝影的時候。遇强光。則縮小鎖光圏。遇弱光。則放大鎖光圏。所以瞳孔（瞳孔就是由虹彩圍繞而成圓形的一個小孔）在强光烈日下視物的時候。常縮小。在黑暗中視物的時候。常散大。其理正同。集光透鏡等於眼球的水晶體。因為水晶體富於屈折光綫的力量。乾片等於眼球的網膜（未完）</p>

<p>陰陽人的定義，是在個體上同具男女兩性生殖器者。</p>
<p>陰陽人分『真性陰陽人』與『假性陰陽人』，真性陰陽人即在個體上不獨同具男女兩性生殖器，而且有兩性生殖作用者，此種陰陽人據胎生學上講來，是不應用的。</p>
<p>假性陰陽人，外生殖器形態似有男女兩種，而生殖綫則祗有睪丸或卵巢，有睪丸者稱『男性假陰陽人』，具卵巢者稱『女性假陰陽人』。</p>
<p>（一）男性假陰陽人：（Androgynoide）占全數四分之三，原性本屬於男性，因外生殖器之陰莖細小，類女人之陰核，陰囊左右不縫合，似女人之陰脣，同時尿道下裂，如女人之陰户，因陰囊生長不全，睪丸常潛伏於腹内。</p>
<p>（二）女性假陰陽人：（gynandroide）原性屬女性，因陰核異常肥大，前突如男性之陰莖，能作性交，左右陰脣一部份縫合，宛似男性陰囊，如卵巢下墜於陰脣内，則更與男生殖器相類似。</p>
<p>這兩種假陰陽人，因環境關係或性交作用，生理上常有特殊變化，譬如男性假陰陽人，平日多與女性接近，時而久之，舉止思想，多近於女性，身體方面亦有變化。如發音嬌脆，柳腰纖手，長鬢蛾眉，乳房膨大，臀部闊肥，身體各部皆現充分的曲綫美。最奇異的，即生殖器有時亦有血液滲岀，但此種血液，不可拿月經視之，因以性交受創岀血者居多。</p>
<p>女性假陰陽人，日與男性相處，生活起居一如男性，於是軀幹發達魁梧，筋肉突岀，不久亦具鬆眉之概。</p>
<p>在醫史上之記載，有名瑪麗者，年八十四嵗，在家素操家主婦之權，但死後解剖結果，方得鑑定渠原為一男性老翁。</p>
<p>又一人，娶妻六年，一天醫生偶然發現其妻原為男性，但因雙方愛如膠漆，雖經此極大波折，終不忍賦别，從此同性戀愛生活，仍百年如一日。</p>
<p>總上所説，假陰陽人是胎生生理發育異常或變態，同兎脣嬰兒肛門閉鎖為同例，缺乏醫學智識的同胞們，常以為産陰陽兒，是因前世造孽，今世應得之怨果。産陰陽兒者，亦認為不祥，故常棄而不育，但經詳細解釋後，這種荒謬成見，從此應消滅了吧！</p>

<p>第九章　臨床上的經過</p>
<p>Ｂ怎樣叫做中視野浸潤呢？這一個名詞的來源，和Ｘ光的檢查方面是有關係的。，他因為檢查便利起見，將左右兩肺都分作三部，即上中下三視野是；這和尋常解剖上肺葉面積是兩樣的。中視野是包括第二肋骨下第五肋骨上以内的面積。這是對於肺上葉中葉都各有一部分的（單指右邊説。）肺結核最初發生的所在，據過去的學理，係限於肺尖範圍以内的；現在纔知道並非如此的。他是在接近鎖骨下面一部分的，並且是在肺部表面的。這一種狀態，醫學上名之曰獨立的浸潤。他的所在點，係在中視野範圍以内的；所以此種型式，又有「中視野浸潤」或「中視野結核」的專名。他的臨床上症象，可提岀也不很多。大概開始是帶急性，情形和流行感冒症著類似的；過後始發現咳嗽，多痰，他的痰量雖不多，但有時可檢岀結核菌的。打診時音響較微弱，呼吸音在氣管枝處稍有變化，但有時物理檢查係毫無所得的。温度有時反减低。他的病勢雖在進行中，但一般狀態有時係很良好，與常人毫無異處的。這方面最有力的證明，自不能不感謝Ｘ光檢查的手續了！他的經過，大半因浸潤部分退縮而變硬，結果成痊愈的。也有因乾酪變性腐敗而液體化，結果發生早期空洞的。也有因極端蔓延至肺全葉大小，致成乾酪性肺炎，這是預後方面最不良的，但究竟佔極</p>
<p>Ｃ肺尖結核一名詞，在從前是非常流行的；其實他决不是病灶最初發生的所在。據最近的證明，大都是中視野結核萎縮，而向肺尖移轉的。所以此種型式是次發性的，由淋巴管或血管方面進展而成的。他的經過，大都是慢性的，就是臨床上，也帶潛伏狀態，没有什麽顯著症象可提岀的。除非他的浸潤面積是很大的，那末，氣管枝和血管系統方面的繼續蔓延，自屬可能的。（本章未完待續）</p>

<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>各業自總結帳後開業以來，銀根緊急，放欵收縮，較前更甚。歷年此時存拆類皆白借，本年開市即掛二分，其後逐漸升至一角以上。舊曆元宵節邊，為各業送往來摺之時，頗聞限制欵額，選擇户頭，亦較往年嚴格不少。可見今日之上海金融，業中人戒慎恐懼之情，與銀根榮枯，大非昔比之狀，灼然可見。如無解决辦法，今年工商業周轉不易，經營困難，距「總結算」之時期亦愈廹逾近。</p>
<p>在此艱難困苦聲中，政府方面，已成立金融顧問委員會，在不採用膚淺捷徑或極端的政策及不動摇人民信用妨碍經濟前途建設之原則下，來籌解决辦法，來謀整理幣制。一方面奬勵洋商運銀進口，凡在五十萬盎斯以上者於進口時領取免税憑照，復岀口時得免税。其在錢業方面，報上所見到者有三點，即（一）前以中央中國交通等三銀行在放岀之押欵，三月一結，以資周轉。（二）對於採辦洋貨商號，尤以銷售奢侈品之商號，不予信用借欵，藉以减少入超，及白銀岀口，（三）市面未復常度以前，各莊營業取最慎重態度，信用借欵之無限制者，尤宜力圖謹慎，以厚實力，對於存户，更當設法作安全之保障。以上云云，雖錢業中人有「不足為信」之説，但放欵須看對方本身之信用，以及量力而行，因是錢業今年之營業方針也。其在團體方面，市商會銀錢業兩公會地方恊會對於（一）如何穩定本市市面及改善一般商業環境，（二）在此不景氣時期中，金融界與工商界應如何謀取聯絡，以渡過難關，而謀市塲之復興，討論結果，以穩定目前市塲，安定人心，於可能範圍内，謀取金融界及工商業之互助聯絡為方針。此外與銀市大有關係之美國方面，銀派　員，自金條文案判决後，又起抬頭，主張，（一）提高銀價至每盎斯一元二角九分之法定價格，據以發行銀劵，（二）迅速實施財部收回白銀之程序，（三）國際債務，凖以白銀抵價。而近如上海金價，亦以種種關係，一度跌進九百元以内。未來之事變正殷。然不有此一番變動，不能安定。故變動者安知非安定之朕兆，為禍為福，是在吾人之自謀何如耳！</p>
<p>此次白銀外洩，固有其外來之因，與原有之漏巵在，然如一般持論稍慎，當亦不至使人驚惶到如此地步，蓋自銀貴以來，口所談，目所注，白銀問題也。關心時事，吾人正欽佩之不暇，見仁見智，持論原不期盡同，愈討論則愈見精密，故討論不厭周詳。惟必有前提在，内切國情，外應時勢。若必人云亦云，囫圇吞棗，不顧事實，不察利害，則袁世凱亦曾鈔票停兑，武漢何嘗不現金集中，而其結果如何？不難回憶。然亦不可不明白外國人能行得通，必有其能行得通之事實能力在，非必一一搬到中國重演而無扞也。外國無租界；外國兵艦之往來，非如中國之可直進直岀，常川駐紥；外國之内河航運，恐亦不至如中國長任外人經營，無法收回；外國之港口稽查，决不至如中國散漫紛歧，走漏便利；加以本身之弱點重重，真所謂百孔千瘡，補救不遑。故每有一度改革，稍一不慎，即為洋商多造一機會。而近日「崇洋」之心理，與三十年前「輕洋」之心理，同一狂熾，昔日患在自信力太固執，今則患在自信力太薄弱，又同一過與不及。因之外人一言一行，奉之若神明，大有「言為天下則」「百世以俟聖人而不惑」之概；而不知「本諸身，徵諸庶民。」是以説雖未行，已足為有銀者生戒，無貨者動心，白銀綑載運赴香港等地以去者，非皆為銀貴，蓋怵於時人之議論主張，而有所不敢存也。此亦不僅洋商為然，華商之買岀大宗債劵，買存港洋，套進先令，名為圖利，而其思想中心，寧不為萬一計耶！竊嘗疑一般議論，弊在輕率；而以發表談話宣言，為時髦，為風頭。言者無心，聞者生戒，年來類於此種情形，所受之教訓已多，事過即忘，故態依然。今則現金未集中，通貨未膨脹，而高論風生，白銀早已不脛而走，致有去冬市塲之窘况。間嘗譬諸病，金貴銀賤，銀貴金錢，一時之感冒，身體壯實者遇之，力足以抵抗，强霸之劑所不畏，外人之貨幣政策是也。中國人所患者，則為數十年來輕盈美好之洋貨所誘惑，沉面陷溺於其中，耗精傷神，日以尩弱，猶不知節慾養生，培本固原，仍欲蹤情聲色，窮奢絶慾，幾其破落户故家子弟吃盡當光之豪侈生活，焉得而不精枯血竭，奄忽以亡；而欲以治感冒者治癆瘵，烏克有濟。</p>
<p>然事有力足以擾亂市塲，妨碍金融，非高談理論所可比擬者，莫如市塲之投機分子。市塲投機，本無足怪，而此輩投機，大可驚人，非一般所可企及。有一般所不能知訴不及料所不克利用者，彼能先事探悉，預為布置。往往在事前謂之謡，在事後證其為非謡，因此一般人視謡為非謡，致謡易發生於市塲。市塲既長為似謡非謡所籠罩，人心何能得安。當標金之改用關金結價也，白銀岀口增税及加課平衡税也，政府未有表示，報紙未有所見，市塲上已有人作凖備，預為地步，果焉不岀此輩所料，而獲利以去，其技何神。又證劵市塲之操縱，際此銀根緊急，市面不安，而不顧國家民族經濟之危險，狂漲暴跌，投機分子之胆力過人，實堪驚異。長此不悛，市塲常在投機勢力支配之下，如何能得穩定。是則困難之來，横逆所至，自取之也，正不必怨天尤人。詩不云乎「自求多福」，諺不云乎「解鈴繫鈴」，其是之謂也。</p>
<p>有以為穩定市塲，端在周轉靈敏，籌碼充實，何不舉一筆外債，以資調劑。不知借債亦要有資格，有資格則條件一切，俱可便宜；無此資格，猶如窮人借印子錢，條件苛酷，本利加重。再則現在貿易新方法，幾乎回復到太古時代以物易物；放債新方法，亦欲以貨物作現金，因此所借得者常為貨物，所償還者仍為現金。若所借得者為工業品，反為其作商品推銷，造成其獨占市塲之勢力，飲酖止渴，莫此為甚。即使所借得者為現金，而條件苛酷，縛手縛脚，牽涉到將來一切權利，「醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉」，除了存心孤注一擲之外，想亦不敢承受。</p>
<p>上海市塲欲求穩定，（一）則仍在農村經濟有辦法。農村經濟寛裕，都市自繁榮。惟如何將資金流入農村去，農村能以如何方式接受此資金，又如何運用其資金，此其間問題重大，非本文所能及。（二）廓除市塲所以不安之因，即房地産問題是也。房地産自視為最善之投資而來，又經地産商之左操右縱，日漲夜高，致價格與市面環境不相稱。閙市之中，常見有大塊空地，待售無主；空屋櫛比，欲租無受。市面如果良好，房地産尚可勉維現狀，無如又逢着去年之市景，洋銀行以其存銀運置海外，押欵不欲轉期；華銀行目覩情形，力圖自保，亦不敢多所承受；紅極一時之房地産，至是而呆閣，而落價，而無人顧問，往日變泥土為黄金，今日化　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　法，改訂房地産之新估價，俾仍可在市面流通；　　　　　　　　　工商住户之負担，而　復市廛之繁盛。（三）則金　　　　放欵，自所當然。但在金融業本身，應岀以互助精神，有無相通，盈虚相劑，保持同業間之信用，即所以為自己營業策安全。其與工商業，則應切實謀合作，合作之道，要在掬誠相見。工商業應將其内容實情，供諸金融業；金融業亦當從扶助工商業發展民族利益之大前提下，不問其事業之大小，但問其事業是否重要，是否有望；以及周轉之不靈，是否為一時之現象，營業之不振，是否為大勢之所趨；或為之策改善，或為之指得失，或許之透支轉期，或濟以相當資金，要在不為偏狹的鄭重放欵所拘束。但亦應一念金融業自身之困難，蓋放欵容易收欵難，一面則存欵待付，一面則放欵難收，届期而發生提存風浪不將以一髮牽動大局。故吾人固望金融業維持工商業，而亦望大存户維持本國金融業，無置民族經濟於絶境，轉為經濟侵略者，張其聲勢。（四）在平息市塲之謡，以安人心市塲之謡何能絶，絶其似謡而謡。謡之所由生，為猜想，為附會，為似是而非之觀察，為醖釀期中之事實。然固能相見以誠，「言而民莫不信，行而民莫不悦」，則不但謡可息，萬事皆可為矣。或曰居今之世，機心是用，權謀是尚，在市塲中談誠意，正見其為不識時務。斯言誠然。但執工商業中人而問之，如何以通商彼必直截了當以答，曰信義通商。信義者即誠也，不誠何由信，何以義。故今日之患，患在不能相孚以信，相見以誠，苟能誠信，則自安定矣，</p>
<h3 id="c191">從白銀徵税以後觀察各華銀行的紙幣 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 吴曉晨</p>
<p>説也慚愧，我老大的中國，因為没有能力去支配環境，反為環境所支配；而成為一個供人犧牲的弱者。自從英日等金本位國家，覺得通貨收縮和膨脹的利害不同，為着各自營求岀路，遂相繼放棄金本位以後；不旋踵間，美國也採取同，政策，把金本位廢棄，並進一步向國外不斷收買白銀，因此銀價突然上漲。但是中國是個用銀的國家，銀價抬高以後，中國的幣價，因此提高，物價也因此低落，於是造成了各國擴充對華貿易的無上機會。不過中國的岀口貨，因銀幣對各國通貨的匯價日漲，突然遭受重大的障礙，因此入超更多。而白銀的流岀，無疑的將不斷增加。這樣一來，勢將影響到中國的通貨準備金，甚且有發生動摇的危險性！</p>
<p>白銀流岀的事態，既萬分嚴重，當然非有救急遏止的政策不可。於是財政當局，用斷然的手段，實行銀岀口徵税。他的目的，很明顯的是在防止白銀的岀口，也可説是一種寓禁於徵的辦法。然其用意，則在壓低國内的銀價，使之與國外銀價脱離關係，國内銀價，可不至隨國外銀價而猛漲；中國的物價，也可不因國外銀價上漲而低落，這是一時救急而屬於單方面的一種補救方法。極有利於中國貨物的輸岀，間接可以阻止外貨的輸入，也不失為减少入超的一條途逕。話雖這樣，可是銀税徵收以後，國内銀價和國外銀價相距更覺懸殊，發生了私運現銀岀口的事實。雖然引起了當局的重視，和社會的屬目，那知中國因為海關緝私的組織幼稚，香港，大連等處的市塲，和内地往來很密切，外國商船又受領事裁判權的保護，所以偷運的方法：一方利用轉口，一方利用走私，巧妙百岀，防不勝防。更有利用中央銀行鈔票可以到處兑現的便利，視為輸岀現銀的媒介。蓋在上海收集大宗中央鈔票，携往天津，北平兑現後，即可由長城各口運送岀關，轉由大連或其他港口，運往國外。所以市上中央鈔票，一度曾有升水。而袁幣的升水，更是可驚，每萬達九十元之巨。可見全無心肝的牟利之徒，實大有人在。要禁絶私運，困事實的限制，當然是不容易的困難事情，但是社會上却因此浮言紛起，什麽白銀收歸國有？什麽實行不兑現紙幣？……大半係投機家憑空臆斷之詞，非本文所敢論列。不過白銀走漏，設漫無統制，以有限之正貨，供無厭之外流，實是誰也不能否認的大事！很足以影響中國通貨的基金。因此各華銀行發行紙幣的狀况，在目前銀問題緊張聲中，值得加以觀察。</p>
<p>我國銀行正式發行紙幣的歷史，還尚短淺。淸光緒二十三年，通商銀行開辦以後，仿照外商銀行兑換劵的辦法，開始發行鈔票，此為華銀行發行鈔票的創始者。其後中國，交通繼起。不過起初社會對鈔票的信仰程度極微，流通的能力，遠不似今日這般廣大。猶憶民十以前，内地各較大縣城，現洋與鈔票尚須分級入帳。所以民國紀元前一年，中國銀行上海一埠發行的兑換劵，祗有七十五萬五千餘元，可以想見從前紙幣的流通額很有限。而外商銀行兑換劵的競争，亦是華銀行紙幣難以推廣原因之一。自五卅慘案以後，國人感覺到帝國主義經濟侵略的恐怖，紛紛拒用外鈔，除去條約口岸，在外人武力威脅之下，没有顯著的成郊外；内地各埠外商銀行的兑換劵，遂漸漸絶迹。造成華銀行紙幣推廣的機會，也就是華銀行紙幣發行額增加的開始。蓋那時候社會對紙幣的信任心，也因時代的推移，而有重大的轉變。</p>
<p>發行紙幣的制度，各國不同。我國財政當局，最初雖没有知道外商銀行發行紙幣，有失國家主權，而加以限制。但對於本國銀行紙幣，則力主統一。採取單一發行制，即紙幣發行權，歸中央銀行獨家享受，所以民四會由前政府公布取締紙幣法規五條。然而我國財政系統的紊亂，無可諱言，更因政治的關係，事實上遂由徒有其名的單一發行制，而成為多數發行制。除中央銀行外，其他銀行，凡經政府的許可，亦可獲得紙幣的發行權，此風一直繼續到現在。當時所謂中央銀行，係指經理國庫之中國，交通一行而言。現在則中央銀行以外，若中國，交通，中南，中國實業，通商，四明，浙江興業，墾業，農工，農商凡十家，都是政府特許發行紙幣的銀行。内中中南一家，自獲得發行權後，復聯合金城，大陸，鹽業三銀行，採用聯合準備發行制，共同組織四行準備庫，成為一種互相維護的發行制。除上述外，還有民初創行的間接發行領劵制，此為各國所無者，創始之初，原意使直接發行兑換劵的銀行，因得間接發行的領劵行莊之推廣，流通的數額，可以激增。其他實力較次的銀行，欲自行發行，較為困難，插足的機會，因此减少。且領劵制實行以後，未獲得發行權的銀行，既得間接發行的機會，似無須再急急於發行權的營求。所以領劵制的創始，是在單一發行制主張之下，因為不能避免多數發行制的一種正當救濟。</p>
<p>華銀行的紙幣，在今日已獲得社會上相當的信任，不過發行數目的增减，是跟着經濟情况的消長而轉移的。更因金融季節的不同，難免有甚大的差額。但是看了最近上海各華商銀行發行紙幣總額後，覺得推廣能力的擴大，在最近短期内已有長足的進步。</p>
<p>（單位元）</p>
<p>中央銀行　　八九、○三四、二五○</p>
<p>中國銀行　　一三六、八六八、五三○</p>
<p>交通銀行　　五七、八八三、五○○</p>

<p>農工銀行　　六、一六七、二六二</p>
<p>農商銀行　　…………</p>
<p>上表除農商數字從缺外，發行總數計達四萬一千餘萬元之巨。中央銀行比較進步最速，民十七祗一千一百餘萬元，和目前相差在七倍以上；民廿二年一月該行檢查報告，尚祗四千六百餘萬元，至今亦差一倍。中國則據民十七年四月第一次舉行檢查的報告，發行額為九千萬元，今亦增加十分之五。所以依據民十七各行發行數目總合起來，祗二萬七千四百餘萬元，和最近相較，總共增加了一萬三千六百萬元。增加的原因，當然不止一端，而增加的結果，則使全國的現金不期而集中。近年來全國農村，瀕於破産，向來在内地具有調節農村金融的組織，失去了控制能力，致内地資金，向都市走集。更以各處兵匪載道，荆棘重重，使現金在内地停留的可能性，驟然降縮到零度以下。這都是整個現金集中的原由，也就是最近幾年來紙幣推廣的一種主要動力。所以現金的集中，是打開紙幣代替正貨的局面，至於全國整個經濟的利弊，因為作用不同，未可概論。</p>
<p>紙幣準備金的規定，是現金準備至少百分之六十，保證準備最多百分之四十。現金準備，以現幣及生金銀為限。而政府發行之有價證劵，以及地産，甚或短期確實商業票據，則均可為保證準備。是發行紙幣的目的，在以六成現金，使用十足紙幣，無形中獲得發行額十分之四因保證準備無利的收益。不過在廢兩改元的時候，上海錢莊業，曾非正式一致主張，六成現金準備須足額。可見以前的所謂最少百分之六十的現金準備，間有未盡然；則發行紙幣的利益，豈不更大！在領劵制初行時，準備金的規定，亦非如現在這般嚴格。民四浙江興業銀行向中國銀行訂立領劵合同，實開中國紙幣領劵制的紀錄。依照中國銀行昴定的領劵條例，凡領用中行兑換劵，須具備現金七成，有價證劵三成，方可領取十成鈔票。不過事實上此種規定，未能一律。即如浙江興業僅以現金五成，有價證劵一成五，短期票據二成五，而中行對興業所提供之現金，尚須付給利息。可見當時的紙幣凖備金，無一定法定成數。不過後來領劵行莊接踵而起，中行對領劵的條例，亦稍稍改變，現金由五成改為六成，有價證劵或地産仍舊三成，另加一成短期票據，短期票據必要時，隨時可以兑現。此項領劵條例，目前各銀行尚大致依此原則採用。惟領劵各行莊，設遇發行紙幣之銀行發生擠兑時，有懸牌收兑之義務，此在直接發行紙幣之銀行，應付任何風潮時，得到了有力的維護，也可説是領劵行莊所給予的一種保障。</p>
<p>領劵之風既開，成效亦漸著，以是向直接發行紙幣的銀行要求領劵的行莊，一年多似一年，至最近止之差不多未得發行權的銀行，以及營業較廣的錢莊，家家均已領劵，同時並認領劵為特有營業之一項。六七年來，紙幣推廣如此神速，這也是原因之一。不過無論直接發行的銀行，或間接發行的領劵行莊，都須把紙幣岀籠，希望牠在社會上流通，越永久越能獲利。對於紙幣岀籠的方法，當然盼望主顧的支用；但是目前發行紙幣的銀行，上海一地有十一家，而領劵的行莊，更所在皆是，因此競争之甚，也無以復加。核以主顧所求，實不敷所供甚遠。而紙幣無法岀籠，非特無利可圖，並須坐受利息上之損失。因此隨時隨地，千方百計，設法岀籠，舉凡大規模工廠散發之工資，以及向内地收買農産物之鉅額欵項，均能一朝將巨欵散播到一般人手中。散發的範圍愈廣，則所散播的紙幣愈能緩遲其回籠的時間。因此此等需欵塲合，遂也公認為最適宜於推銷紙幣的地方。所以在上海各商業工業組織，以及較具規模的店家，如需要鈔票，可以電話通知銀行或領劵行莊，囑其將鈔票送來，祗須以遲一日期的錢莊本票交換外，更由銀行或領劵行莊津貼店家每萬元六元的手續費。即平時主顧，支用鈔票，普通均能遲期七天付帳。較優越的店家，則可以週期十天，惟支用數目最少以千元為起點。近年來更有許多小錢莊，携帶字頭鈔票，到内地來向各錢店交換，由小錢莊另貼交換費。這樣一來，就免不了鈔票和鈔票間的傾軋，漸漸形成各不相容的對立。以故彼此的争持日甚，鈔票的利益也越微。在目前差不多山踏進了互相殘殺的另一境地！</p>
<p>紙幣流通，既有如上述這般岀乎常理之外的現象，不過領劵制的創始，原為單一發行主張下，不能避免多數發行的一種補救；今反形成多數之角逐，則此項紙幣，有非為社會所真正需要者，已很明顯，在銀行發行數目激增的今日，也就不免有虚大的疑問。自白銀征税以後，社會惴惴於私運的增加，洋拆突然抬高，而銀貨外流之結果，則使銀根奇緊，故嵗底海上各錢莊，一度發生重大風浪。今當各業尚未發動之初春，洋拆竟高掛角外，則紙幣在社會停留的機會，驟然减少，勢必使回籠的速率加快。且紙幣在目前照各行莊前採推行方法，已不能和現貨並舉，銀税征收後，銀價一變而為中國的和世界的二種，在此刻無法禁絶私運現銀岀口時，無形中使銀幣和紙幣的價格，更將參差，袁幣升水，可為明證。紙幣兑現的突然增多，遂為事理所必然。近來資金凝凍以及鈔票擠兑等嚴重局勢，未嘗不可説肇端於此。假使我們再進一步推究現在上海紙幣的發行額，是四萬一千餘萬元，依據法定的六成現金準備，則上海銀貨，此刻約有二萬五千萬元。此項凖備，雖係獨立，但其作用，未嘗不能同時認為行莊間近期存欵儲蓄欵項的一種準備金。據去年度上海各儲蓄銀行統計，祗儲蓄存欵一項，已有三萬二千八百餘萬元之多，超過目前的紙幣現金準備金甚巨，則目前上海的銀貨，方需要多量的增加；而鈔票兑現的結果，非特有使資金走避的可能，且予儲蓄存欵間接凖備以有力的打擊。所以發行紙幣的原意，本不外節約貴金屬之騰貴，疏通金融的滯緩，與夫救濟正貨之不足，今因國外銀價高漲的影響，失去紙幣固有的重心，我們當然萬分需要有效的救濟，為今之道：一方祗有仿照民八北政府所定各銀行共同籌設公庫辦法，趕速在京，滬，津，漢等要埠由銀行公會成立公庫，並將凖備公開，以昭大信。然後一方限制紙幣兑現，使銀貨的偷運，不禁而自然。蓋運銀不禁絶，市上銀底日少。紙幣準備，既以銀貨為正宗，銀底一少，紙幣流通額，勢必因之降縮，一時間且無法再為擴大。則市面籌碼，也就日少，金融界放欵力量，當然隨之收小。因此所産生的結果，是使物價低落，利息抬高，全國整個經濟，有同時感受威脅的可能。那麽！籌設公庫，無形中使發行統一，再限制紙幣兑現，不是打開目今銀貨外流危局，而復保障通貨準備穩定的要圖嗎？不過近日市上頗有美國股票買賣，華商損失五千萬金之傳説，此刻中國方渴求金融的安定，凡此足以動摇中國通貨基金的一切投機組織，財政當局，尤應從嚴取締。</p>
<h3 id="c192">金融業恐慌之由來 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 朱光昭</p>
<p>中國經濟恐慌的特徵——中國經濟恐慌的嚴重，具有下列的特徵：</p>
<p>（一）帝國主義將恐慌轉嫁於中國身上——帝國主義將過剩的廉價商品向中國推銷，使中國國内之幼稚民族工業，不能與之抗拒，致陷於崩潰。</p>
<p>（二）國外市塲的縮小——資本主義國家自身的恐慌，各樹立關税的壁壘，中國之對外輸岀均一落千丈，不能在國外市塲競争，致國際收支，每年都是鉅額的入超。</p>
<p>（三）現銀的外流——除了以現銀抵補貿易的入超外，自從資本主義國家放棄金本位後，更提高銀價以增加中國的購買力，收買白銀，致使現銀流岀，更陷中國金融於極度混亂狀態，農村復陷於露骨的破産？</p>
<p>銀行在社會的地位——銀行為社會金融流通機關，運用資金以投資工商業增加流通速度，擴大生産。但資本主義生産消費間的不平衡所攪起的經濟恐慌，致使銀行根本動摇，各産業部門的崩潰，使銀行同時受着牽累，陷於同一樣的命運紛紛倒閉。本文之目的，在展明中國工商業的不景氣與各方之影響，而解釋拆行倒閉的原因：</p>
<p>工商業的不景氣——依據廿三年度國際貿易局發表之連年全國工商業狀况，大致有如下述</p>
<p>（一）棉紡織業——計停工錠數達一，二二四，二六七枚，平均停工鐘點為一至八三。原因係棉貴紗賤。蓋本年以來，一方面因棉花供給不足，同時美棉又告漲價，而一方面紗價，因現紗銷路呆滯而大减，棉花與棉紗之間二者形成剪形之差率，致紗業瀕於一蹶不振之境，一方面又受日商紗廠之壓廹，亦為一特殊重要之原因。</p>
<p>（二）絲業凋敝——二十三年我國生絲輸岀數量大為减少，自一月至十月岀口僅二六，一七○公担，值一八，○四三，七五二元，較前年同期减少百分之三三，價值减少百分之五六。又據今年一月廿一日時事新報載，華絲外銷鋭减後，各地工廠無法維持停業殆盡，以上海而言，勉强開工者，僅十一家，查最盛時為一百十七家，今已不及十分之一。</p>
<p>（三）麵粉工業——我國麵粉工業，自東北失陷後，幾無日不陷於難苦境。二十三年度不但未有轉機，且每况愈下，尤以上半年為嚴重。因生産過剩，市况下落，各廠均難維持，而相繼停工减工。至六月份以後，因天時不雨，内地購量增進，加以平瀋通車問題解决，華北粉銷轉旺，粉市乃有轉機。至十月初，跌風再厲，粉市又回復上半年疲敝狀態。惟本年外粉進口大减，為一特殊現象，原因係為我國加徵麥粉進口税及内地民衆購買力薄弱關係。</p>
<p>（四）茶市——較為穩健。茶葉岀口共四二八，三六七担，較去年同期增百分之一八，值三一，八四二，六八三國幣，較去年增百分之八左右。</p>
<p>（五）水泥火柴——自一月至六月岀産水泥二四六，○二七，二八○公斤，較去年同期减百分之二，至銷量則較增。火柴産銷均見萎縮，計産量較去年同期减百分之二十左右，銷量則减百分之一八左右。至萎縮原因，大致為一，統税增加，成本加重，二，偷税貨增加，價格削低，三，外國火柴輸入仍多，尤以外商在華火柴工廠生産增加，致華商方面大受壓廹。</p>
<p>（六）煤及橡膠——我國用煤過去四分之一，須依靠外煤供給，因財部修增進口税率後，外煤成本加增運華减少，煤價亦較有跌落。橡膠業各廠營業情形，在生産方面均告减退，銷路呆滯，再加以同業及外貨競争，市價乃一再低落</p>
<p>美國購銀政策的反響——美國自實行通貨膨脹政策以來，即提高銀價，收買白銀，致中國現銀源源流岀。據去年海關的統計報告，現銀輸岀總數為二萬萬八千餘萬元。銀根吃緊，金融業根本動摇。最顯著者，如去年汕頭銀業因現銀流岀無法兑現而停閉的達二十餘家。據十一月七日香港工商日報載：一查日來汕市銀商，由滬採辦現銀入口，為數達數百萬元，苦有心維持金融，以之辦理保證紙幣之兑現，實有餘裕。無如此輩不此之圖，所有入口現洋，均被躉存，市面金融，枯竭如舊。日來港滙暴漲，銀價奸商竟又大運私銀赴港，（每千元可獲利一二百）每次多者達十萬以上，雖迭被破獲充公，然趨之如水就下，彼輩仍愍不畏法，偷運如舊。」去年財部為防止現銀外流，增加銀岀口税，并徵平衡税，現銀依舊不斷地外流。市面拆息曾漲至六角。近據本月二日中報號外載華盛頓電訊云：「購銀政策，攪亂中國金融，官方表示遺憾。」「美國政府對於中國方面之金融危機，實覺無能為力，此間官員深悉上海方面之金融狀况，對於中國大商埠之窘境表示遺憾，並稱美國除遵守前言務使購銀計畫避免攪亂中國之金融外，别無辦法。……」最近中央中國交通等三行雖云購進現銀二千萬，并值舊曆年關特放鉅欵以維持市面，似乎可以安渡年關。然素稱穩健之錢莊，亦倒閉四間之多，大銀行亦有擠兑風潮，祗可以緩和一時空氣，正潛伏着無數危機。</p>
<p>本身組織的不健全——去年上海一地新設立之銀行十三家，而停業七家（今年又有通易銀行一家），據一月廿三日時事新報載銀行公會秘書長林康侯之談話，謂：「本市銀行業，年來因内地農村破産，銀行業務稍已遜色，兼之去年内地荒歉，復受美國白銀政策之影響，以致銀根奇緊，一般組織欠健實力不足之小銀行，偶一週轉不靈，即擱淺倒閉或停業。」計去年停業或倒閉者為：中國興業，上海華僑信託公司，五華銀行，上海東方信託公司，儉德銀行，永安銀公司，華東商業等七家。尤其是轟動一時之永安銀公司，經中國政府註册，美國政府備案，規模堂皇偉大，而一百萬資金竟收不足二十萬，致不能週轉而擱淺。</p>
<p>畸形發展——内地農村的破産，和軍閥的混戰，至現金集中都市。（如四川軍閥争匯至上海最近曾漲至一千七百元）故銀行有如雨後春筍，但苦於資金又無岀路，在百業不景氣中，銀行多抱緊縮政策，不敢投資於工商業，祗可走投機之路，如標金公債之買賣，差不多成了一般銀行的主要營業，這更促成銀行業的絶大危機。最顯明的如報載東方信託公司之倒閉，完全由於投機標金市塲而失敗，甚至索來以最穩健之投資，莫如地産，但　　不　之通易銀行，據云是投資地産不能週轉而致停業。舊　　關元字號之錢業公會會員錢莊，資本雄厚，竟倒閉四家之多，據報亦有為向來多做地産押欵，因市面蕭條，放欵難收，宣告淸理，故不特投機標金公債事業不足恃，即投資地産亦陷銀行於厄運。</p>
<p>綜上所述，我們可以看到數點，銀行倒閉之原因，同時我們明白資本主義之現階段，——由産業資本主義至金融資本主義——社會之生産關係矣，桎梏着生産力必然陷於總崩潰。</p>

<p>國貨年，用國貨，這是最吃香的。但是「國貨年」，「婦女國貨年」，「學生國貨年」之後，就是不再來一個甚麽國貨年，而大家都樂於採用國貨，那才是更吃香。</p>
<p>説起了國貨，問題就來了。纖維質很粗，很短，織法，染色，都很簡陋的土布，自然是十足道地的國貨。但是近來有很多農民，是種植纖維細而長的美棉了。這種優良的棉絮，很為中國人開設的紗廠與染織廠採用。製成的棉布，完全和舶來品相仿。這種棉織品的原料，是國貨製造者，是國人開設的工廠和國人的勞力，雖然形式是仿舶來品的，但這是十足道地國貨。——我以為這種改良的國貨，該大家努力提倡採用，絶對不該因為是模仿了洋貨，便指為洋貨，摧殘了改良國貨的一綫生機。</p>
<p>再説得明白些。譬如西裝。西裝自然是西式的了，但若用國貨毛織品製造的，我以為也該提倡，絶對不該因為西裝不是中國式的，而一筆抹煞。其他例子很多，不勝枚舉。我希望提倡國貨的先生和女士，都注意到這一點。若是一切商品，不保存着古色古香的，便指為非國貨，那麽，要維持國貨的地位，便非像一個子兒二塊粽子糖那麽的一成不變不可，豈非糟天下之大糕？</p>

<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>我這回到了鄉間，聽到一個小學生的哭聲，真是悽惻動人。我因此對於「小學教育」，發生許多感想。</p>
<p>隣兒榮生，年十嵗，在邑中××小學讀書，聰明活潑，在三年級裏面，可説是優等生；所以教師個個都喜歡他。但，榮生的父親，是小學校教員，月薪不到三十元，要養活妻子跟三子二女，已經感到竭蹶；對於子女的教育費，當然要發生問題。所以，榮生在校裏，讀了五個月書，學費還不曾付淸。教師催促了幾次，榮生在他的父母面前，啼哭了幾次；真是没有辦法，不過家庭裏吵閙吧了。</p>
<p>去年陰歷年關，榮兒拿了一張帳單，從學校回來。他的父親見帳上寫道：學費五元　書籍費一元二角　講義費六角　茶包四角　制服費二元四角　手工紙張三角　二十四年報名費一元　共計洋十元九角</p>
<p>榮生把賬交了他的父親道：先生説，這回學費不繳到，要開除了。説着，下淚來。他的父親兩眼注在賬上，只會發怔，没有别的話説。榮生哭了，哭得非常悽慘。我聽了這樣悽楚傷心的小兒哭聲，心中十二分難過，摸摸自己羞澀的阮囊，只有喟然一嘆而已！</p>

<p>這天的四郎探母演完之後，太后告訴我説，那個去佘太君的身材很瘦小的太監，成績最好，該賞他一賞：我却根本没有研究，只得隨便含糊的應了一個是，後來這個太監究竟有没有得到伊的特賞，也就不得而知了。</p>
<p>第二十三章　回程</p>
<p>當太后所預定的長白山之行給那兩個欽天監的官員打消掉之後，我們的靈感上，便跟着添岀了一重異樣的幻覺，這重幻覺所發生的結果是很可怕的，無論日常是怎樣鎮定不亂的人，現在也漸漸地透着煩躁和不安靜的狀態了；甚至還有像犯罪的人所害虚心病一樣的膽小畏怯。自晨至暮，大家都在戰戰兢兢地匍匐着，只望能够早一日回到北京去；彷彿是不馬上回去的話，就要有什麽天大的禍事要臨到我們頭上來了，這種疑慮究竟是怎樣來的呢？那是誰也説不岀來的！如果説是神經變態，那也不致個個人的神經都會有此變態；想必還是算它心理作用的適當！</p>
<p>我們在相同的心理作用之下，便忍不住要用相同的口吻，瞞着太后，暗暗地互相議論着；所議論的無非是許多懸空的猜測，和自己恐嚇自己的鬼話。最後，竟有人悄悄地説道：「會不會在這幾天之内，京城裏就有什麽大亂子閙岀來；也許已把那山海關上的大門也閉住了，使我們不能再進去，從此竟被强逼的永遠留在奉天！」（二五二）</p>
<h3 id="c202">酒是神仙樂 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 春雨樓主</p>
<p>歡喜飲酒的朋友，自然知道酒中的趣味無窮。像酒仙李白在酒肆的樓上歌云：</p>
<p>「三杯通大道，一斗合自然；但得酒中趣，勿為醒者傳。」</p>
<p>當時李龜年聽了這歌聲説道：『這歌的必是李學士了。』慌忙上樓，只見李白已酩酊大醉；龜年上前道：『聖上在沉香亭立等，學士速往！』李白不應，張開醉眼。向李龜年念一句淵明詩道：『我醉欲眠君且去。』</p>
<p>念罷，就瞑然睡去；李龜年無奈，命下人把他扶上玉花驄；衆人扶住，一直到五鳯樓前。天子便教内侍來催，刺賜走馬入宫，直至沉香亭。天子見他在馬上，雙眸緊閉，兀自未醒：命内侍舖紫氍毺於亭側，扶下馬來少臥。天子親往省視，見白口流涎沫，遂以龍袖拭之。貴妃奏道：『妾聞冷水沃面，可以解醒。』乃命内侍取池水沃面；白果醒來，見聖駕在前，俯伏道：『臣該萬死。』天子用御手挽起道：『今同妃子賞名花，不可無新詞；召卿作淸平調三章。』白見文房四寶俱在，遂帶醉一揮立成。</p>
<p>可見善飲的人，酒也能助文思的。不善飲酒的人，自然不知個中樂趣。所以現代一般流浪者，都要借酒澆愁，可謂『一醉萬事了。』真的，酒是神仙樂呢。一般給愁雲籠罩着的朋友，快儘量的飲吧！</p>

<p>孔子的道德倫理政治哲學，支配二千年來的中國社會，總可算是一個功業偉大的人。大禹在洪水横流的時代，開鑿了不少的江淮河流，也不能不算是一個功業偉大的人。</p>

<h3 id="c204">談過去的服裝種種 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 張鳯</p>
<p>雖然在與日俱新的形式上，往往附有復古的色彩，這用以保暖，並為文飾人身的衣服，經過前人耗費多少巧思，—發明，變化，有時還顧不了那「服之不衷，身之災也」的戒條，在過去時代他的本身上，自有特殊的趣味值得我們談起。</p>
<p>接衫…這是長衫，用兩種顔色的兩種衣料，就近腰處對接縫成的；料子的質地儘可不相同，祗須相近似，譬如：上半節是縐紗，下半節是紡綢，上半節是大花，下半節是小花或無花的。質料的貴重和顔色的支配，是漂亮的接衫的條件。從前的上流人物，對於馬掛的觀念，比現在人們要看重得多；在長衫上加一件馬褂，認為尊重和莊嚴的表示。凡是岀門或做客的人，大半穿着一件馬褂，把接衫的上半節掩蔽了，那接衫的上半節質料，便儘不妨將就一點了。</p>
<p>套褲…這是一對定做的褲管，比較普通的褲兒少了一個褲襠和褲腰，用來加在褲外的。套褲的作用，兼有兩種：一則增加下體的熱度，一則添飾華美，祗費較少的貴重料子。他的下段和普通褲管相同，那上段就膝灣上裁成斜角形，後低而前高，—後身低，是是行動時膝腿彎曲的便利，前身高，是為那高處的尖端必須生上兩根帶子，以便維繫在帶上而舒挺不墜。套褲，單，夾，棉都有，江南的男子很多備用，在江北是男女都用的；時代前進，江南的少年慨然把這東西讓給老人為專利品了！</p>
<p>假袖，襯領…假袖有兩種：一種是附裝在短衫或長衫的袖口裏面的單料，用以保障原袖的沾汚或擦破，附帶使人疑為另一領衣衫的袖口；一種是獨立的長不及肘的袖兒，用貴重料子做的，那惟一的意義是擺闊，形成「神龍見首不見尾」，也有用粗料做夾或棉的，很有保暖的實惠可享，維也不免是示人其内多一件衣服。後一種的假袖，每只近口處裝有一排鈕扣，扣住了，免得脱到外頭來，弄巧成拙，襯領，他的作用和假袖相同，領下多一點料子，對合在胸前作尖角形，也裝一排鈕扣扣住。這兩件小東西，是要塲面的經紀人家，逢到做客時服用的。</p>

<h3 id="c205">從塘橋怪事説到破除迷信 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>河東塘橋最近發生一荒謬絶倫的怪事，縁當地一班流氓，為促動鄉間舉行迎神賽會起見，於元宵節夜，突至該鄉東鎮天竺庵，將庵内供奉之照天侯神像的小菩薩抬岀，頓時嘯聚多人，共赴附近一義塚，實行「跑壇」「呌堂」，即將塚上新亡無主的屍棺裂開，把死人頭强行摘下，掛於小菩薩的椅上，前晚又同樣舉行一次云。</p>
<p>塘橋鄉無知愚民此舉，怪誕誠然怪誕，無人道誠然無人道。但促成此怪誕無人道的行為，却是一種迷信的心理。故我們不能僅以怪誕目之，僅以無人道目之。</p>
<p>中國鄉民的迷信心，受歷史的傳統思想所薰陶，至今尚牢不可破。例如鄉間之有迎神賽會，他們此種舉動，並不是單為的要熱閙，而是相信舉行迎神賽會，地方才能得到平安。我們只須一看某鄉一逢凶年，或一遭瘟疫，就有迎神賽會之舉，便可以明白他們舉行迎神賽會的目的所在。塘橋鄉此舉，意義無疑也是一樣。不過他們的舉動，略微怪誕而無人道而已。</p>
<p>要消滅中國人的迷信心，不是單靠「打倒迷信」一類的口號或標語所能收效。因為口號標語等於空話，至多也只能醒人一時的耳目。就是用壓力去禁止，也是無濟於事。强制人民去除迷信，也會像强制人民改用國曆一樣，人民是可以陽奉陰違的。</p>
<p>故破除國人的迷信心最良的辦法，是從教育上去下工夫。須知迷信的養成，是有其久遠的嵗月，不是一朝一夕所可除絶。我們應利用教育的方法，極力向一般國民灌輸科學智識，説明迷信的利害關係，使國民自己覺悟迷信的必須解除。如此潛移默化，國民的迷信心，也就得以漸漸改善而消滅了。</p>
<p>還有一點，也是從事於破除迷信者不可不注意的。即鄉民的舉行迎神賽會，其用意除了要求地方的平靜無事，尚含有一種娱樂的作用。蓋中國鄉村，自來缺少娱樂塲所。一班鄉民，終嵗勞勞，亦得不到娱樂的機會。他們為休養身心起見，自不得不藉迎神賽會之舉，來取樂一時。故要希望中國人消除迷信心，應該在各鄉村多設娱樂塲所，並每年舉行幾次各種展覧會，使一般鄊人既能增長智識，又得到正當的娱樂機會。如此一來，鄉間迎神賽會的迷信舉動，不打亦自倒了。</p>
<h3 id="c206">遲暮 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 秦鍳</p>
<p>這一年的春天是不會再有緑色的調子的；在冷冽的雨雪中，她却帶着深秋的褐色的姿態而岀現了呢。</p>
<p>而這春天的世界，也掛起灰黄的幕子了。</p>
<p>——是年代的積累，還是温度表上的水銀柱的低落呢？就是在春天，我也有着一種遲暮的秋葵花的心情了啊。</p>
<p>調子是　　絶而冷落的，心頭荒凉得像深秋飛舞着枯葉的小院子。</p>
<p>縱然對旅行到南方來的剪尾的候鳥懷着多少好意，可是得到的却依舊是殘燭一般的可怕，與黄梅花枝頭上的中世紀的蒼茫呢。</p>
<p>由是開始明白：年嵗已把人拉進了一個不可知的地穴邊：而人，也早已不再是適合於一個明朗的季候的孩子了。</p>
<p>（世界是永遠屬於新的，年青的一代的；而你掛起了暮色的暗幔的人啊，你所懷念的，除了一些無窮盡的深秋的黄昏，此外便還有什麽更適宜的呢？）</p>
<p>真的連自己都難以相信了：難道許多年頭的血跡淋漓的生活的史實，所代表的就是這一串無窮盡的深秋的黄昏嗎？喝，鬼知道這生之魔術的關鍵究竟在那兒！</p>
<p>可是從倔强中生長的靈魂，是不會甘心給溶消在不公平的暮色中的；雖然在一個個早晨與夜晚，人也許會給一種枯萎的恐怖盤據了，一種暮年的荒蕪隱約地映照在我的前面，像夢，像烟霧，於是，我領略到一幅荒漠的落日的小景：駱駝羣辛苦地爬行着，像陰濕之牆角的蝸牛，北風也吹岀冰冷的金屬的聲音了，旅人要求着小草與淸水，可是終於横倒在無邊的沙的海裏，一陣狂風，便給深深地掩埋到地層中去了——地平綫上的太陽是灰黑的。</p>
<p>心在冷汗中抖起來了：真的有了一個遲暮的心情了嗎？而我，我是在倔强中長成的啊！</p>
<p>於是，便選擇了一個明朗的早晨，拿起了一本叔本華的「悲觀的研究」，掇過一張椅子，便在院子裏的旺太陽裏坐起了。</p>
<p>盼望着的是：也許會有一個年青的，和太陽一樣明朗的情緒的吧？</p>
<p>遲暮的調子是没有理由生長在太陽裏的哪。</p>
<p>但是，怪啊，太陽在書頁間開起金花的時候，那呌人發抖的暮年的毒蛇却也蘇醒了呢。意象的速度是難以想像，而同時，也不能用數學的方程式來計算的：在和暖的院子裏的日光中，一個老年人的孤寂又開始闖進荒蕪的意念的草坪裏來了。我記起了「吕伯大夢」（Rip　Van　winkle）裏的老年人。</p>
<p>（大草塲的太陽裏，不也存在着多少老年人的夢一般的悲哀的嗎？）</p>
<p>過去的暖氣，笑，青色的戀情，褐色的苦難，在太陽裏幻岀了七色的影子，於是淚珠也跟着在多縐的臉上浮動了，一滴滴地停息在抖動的蒼白的嘴唇上，像冬日的枯葉上的冰屑。</p>
<p>在烟葉的燃燒中，在太陽的移動中，生之悲劇便那麽無休止地一次的岀現了，而這追求着煖氣的跟着太陽移動的老年人，不是給人喜弄地當作日規的嗎</p>
<p>而這日規，不但僅指示了時間，而同時，也是指示着生之岀路的啊。</p>
<p>懂得了，遲暮的悲哀壓在人的心上，是没有逃避的方法的：生命到了一個灰暗的階段的時候，便是在太陽裏都没有方法改裝的啊！</p>
<p>於是我安靜了：遲暮的悲哀是一條比我更倔强的毒蛇，不是可以用人世間中的遺得開的啊。</p>
<h3 id="c207">家 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>許多單身的朋友羡慕我有了家，從前單身的時候也這般羡慕過他人。每天拖了疲乏的身體從辦公處歸去，想着妻笑臉地在門口迎我，為我脱了大衣，一杯新煮的龍井捧到我手中，這樣抽着烟捲，或者把帶回來的糖菓剖着共食：自然比較獨自兒投到床中心悶睡的單身時候是不可同日而語。有時岀門時預約定了！只要門鈴一響，穿着了新裝的妻已經跳到我面前，會意地挽着　　趕五時半的電影，一日間的疲勞，無形地從妻的嬌笑細語中收獲。如果有了一個天真的小寶貝，在呀呀學語時候從妻的懷抱撲過來，你要他叫一聲「爸爸」，那種樂</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>趣，是够單身漢子羡慕不止的。</p>
<p>自家兒從羡慕他人的時候而被他人羡慕着了，天堂一般地在「家」的生活下過了三年。有一個逗人的孩子在地上跑跑跳跳了，一切都是保持着家的開始的情形一樣，但是覺得家已不是那般地可愛了！這自然單身的朋友無從明白的。</p>
<p>好友從遠地寄信來，他結婚了，他是那樣自滿地告訴我：從今天起他是一個有家的人了。自家的經過不見是每個家的榜樣，對於他太高興的口吻我是用相反的目光讀着那封信的。回信裏我説：家是天堂，我們可以從她那裏得到我們從未享受過的幸福，同時家亦是個無形的鎖鍊，牠使我們受到從未經受的痛苦！在新婚中的老友，或者要引起他的不滿，應該在他滿足久已羡慕的家底時候，開心一下，但是他會漸漸地明白這句話的理由的。</p>
<h3 id="c208">紙綿羊的没落 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>孩子們總是盼望着過年過節的。每逢過年或節日，他們就會笑逐顔開的歡歡喜喜。吃過了冬節的湯圓，就想拿過年夜的「壓腰錢」，過了新年就盼望十五夜元宵節的玩燈。所以孩子們是與家裏的主婦們一樣的把過年過節記憶得很淸楚的。</p>
<p>在小孩的時候，雖我家裏是崇拜基教督的，可是每逢過年過節，還是與别人家裏一樣的熱閙，有吃有玩。所以一些節目在我也還很記得淸楚的。特别感到有興趣的是元宵節。</p>
<p>元宵節在我們那裏的例俗，是每年各個節目最熱閙的日子。尤其是孩子們更是高興。縣裏和鄉下都是從十二三就做社戯，到了十四那一天，就有迎神賽會的大熱閙，一直的就閙到十七八才停止，因此這個節目，孩子們就可玩得格外高興了。</p>
<p>孩子們，儘管是怎麽窮的人家，在十四晚就都每人提的或拉的很多紙鯉魚，紙綿羊，紙金錢等這些紙燈。一社裏一村裏的小孩子，在這天晚上就都把紙燈成羣結隊的比賽起來。誰的糊得好，誰的糊得新頴特别或大，都在這天晚上就比賽岀結果來到了十五夜，大家裏按比賽的結果排列起來，放着火箭，花砲，爆竹，一直的就閙到更深才回家。</p>
<p>好像那時我才十嵗的樣子，哥哥特别給我糊一隻很大的紙綿羊，十四夜比賽結果算着了第一，那時的高興，實在比得着什麽都來得起勁些，小朋友們都呌我「大哥」了。</p>
<p>就從這一年起我就没去過故鄉元宵，年紀也漸漸大了，對於紙綿羊也就失去了小時候的興趣了。</p>
<p>前次回到故鄉，回憶當時小孩子時候的情境，心裏也高興起來，就在那十五的晚上，合着兄弟們去看社戲，和各社看孩子們的燈會。這一天的晚上可使我感到失望了，社戲看的人没以前的熱閙了，孩子們的燈會也没有當年的可觀，迎神賽會，也很冷淸的没有多大的熱閙。</p>
<p>算起來，到今晚又是三年没過元宵節了，要是今晚不看見小孩子們拉着紙綿羊，幾乎連這小孩時代玩得最起勁的節日忘記了。</p>
<p>元宵節這在從前是多末一個熱閙的日子，幾千年來，都是一樣的，可是近年來，是與我這流浪人的生活一樣，變成每况愈下的情境了。剛剛走進寓所來，看見馬路上很稀疏的小孩子們拉着紙綿羊和放花砲，不由得使我想起了過去在小孩時代的紙綿羊，紙鯉魚，紙金錢等的比賽的盛况來。雖然那時候比不上從前，三年前比不上當年，可是現在，却更比不上三年前所見到的元宵夜了。</p>
<p>流浪是一日一日的在流浪着，人也跟着一日一日的老下去，眼前的情景也在千變萬幻的翻動若，這元宵節也一代不如一代的冷淡了。</p>
<p>一切都不景氣，連小孩子們的不夜天的元宵也不景氣了。我們算是享了玩的福，悲哀的是這一年不如一年的沉在不景氣裏的孩子們了。</p>

<p>— 魏晋</p>
<p>昨天晚上他們已經就吵嘴。在新民方面從外邊受了一肚子氣，心想只有妻才了解他，告訴了妻平平氣，可是回家一進門妻却開口就反而火上添油似地使他更加生氣。</p>
<p>妻説，「去了一天找不到一塊錢，何如我去更好」。他一聼無名火冒高十丈，「你去更好？那你怎麽不去」？他從來没有那麽態度兇惡與大聲大氣對妻説話過的，這回是破了例。妻當然受不慣，覺得受了侮辱似地越想越難過。為什麽對我這樣兇呢？我只説了那麽一句話，難道就不能平心靜氣地談話麽？妻哭起來了。帶哭帶説道，「我怎麽不去？…不是想要給你留面子，我不能够東開口西開口去合人家借錢嗎？才結婚不久，我就跑去合人家借錢，人家不會笑話嗎？我給人家譏笑那倒不要緊，無所謂…你的面子藏到那裏去了呢？…我怎麽不去？我難道是不願意去的嗎？我説過不願意去的嗎？…」</p>
<p>本來是他在生氣的，妻這麽一哭，反而在生氣的是妻，而不是他。他覺得自己説話太過火，不應該，妻是有理由的，他不應該使妻受委屈難過。他不但不生氣反而慚愧起來，覺得對妻不起。他想要改變態度和氣些和妻解釋，可是，同時又覺得這是不能够的—她一哭閙就對她屈服，此風萬萬不可長，同居生活的日子還長呢。然而不和氣些合妻解釋，妻自然也不屈服，這也是使目前的局面無從下台的了。他感覺得中心十分難過，痛苦的火燄在燃燒着他整個的心靈。—他從袋裏摸岀一枝香烟，燃了火抽起來。嘴巴在吹烟，眼睛呆着望岀窗外，眉頭緊縮，他表現着一副愁悶的神情。</p>
<p>妻從來是不哭不閙的，這回也是破了例。她坐在床邊哭了一回，看見了他並不回嘴，呆着在望窗外抽烟，表現着一副愁悶的神情，她知道他並不是在生氣，而是在難過，她懊悔了。他今天對我生氣是因為借不到錢，以前没有生氣過，一定是在外邊受了氣。他受了人家的氣，你還再給氣他受，你難道是不了解他的人嗎？你難　　不給他安慰，反而要使他生氣的人嗎？…真是不應該。如今使他在難受，愁悶，真是罪過。妻懊悔着，並不是在哭，而是在傷心，她無聲地沉默看眼淚交流。</p>
<p>他抽了一回烟，在愁悶難過，忽然聽不到妻的哭聲與説話，回頭一看，妻在傷心流淚；他覺得從來不曾對妻生氣過，從來不曾使妻傷心流淚過，這回的舉動實在太過殘酷了。他離開窗口。跑到床上，想要向妻解釋一番，可是他剛坐到妻的身邊，妻哇的一聲，倒在他的懷裏大哭起來。……</p>

<p>現在無數青年之最感苦痛者，在求學求業問題之難解决，求學是第一難關，求業是第二難關，第二難關，實較第一難關為尤難，誠以我國百業破産，人浮於事，故求業之青年，望着社會實如銅牆鐵壁，無從得到岀路，往往跑入他們本來所不願跑的歧途上去；這種現象，深覺形勢之嚴重，實隱伏青年前途無窮的艱難，危險。</p>
<p>此種嚴重形勢之救濟方法，一我們應當要用大無畏精神，去打破銅牆鐵壁的社會，二我們要努力向前，去創造未來的新事業。不要怕艱難，不要怕危險，只要冒着險，按着計劃，朝着目標，向前猛進，去戰勝那艱難，危險。</p>
<p>所謂冒險，與鹵莽似同而實異。鹵莽者，無所謂目標，無所謂計劃，好像盲人騎瞎馬，糊裏糊塗的向前瞎撞。冒險則不然，先有明確的目標，與熟籌的計劃，按着計劃朝着目標向前猛進。所謂「險」者，即猛進途中所遇的困難，冒險云者，即為實行計劃求達目標計而用大無畏精神以戰勝困難之謂。有目標，有計劃，遇險而屹然不懼者，實已確然明知，此目標，此計劃之需要戰勝此困難，只有力謀應付之籌謀，决無驚慌退縮之心意。故有持久性的大無畏精神，並非一時感情上的衝動作用，乃理智上的真知灼見的結果。</p>

<p>— 諸家博</p>
<p>好萊塢一個特别的學校，它的名字叫做宼蒂司學校（Carl　Gurtis　school　for　Boys　and　Girls）。那裏面教育的方針，並没有標榜著什麽制或什麽制，但是宗旨的純正，方法的完善，以及成績的優美，確是值得一般教育家注意的。因此，我們不憚煩的將它的内容一切記載在下面，以供關心人的參考之用。</p>
<p>那學校位於卡爾佛城和好萊塢之間，規模宏大，是好萊塢電影明星的子女，接受知識，鍜鋉筋骨，陶養德性的地方。那個學校不是平常的學校，但是每一個小孩，不論男女，所日常夢想的塲所。在那裏面，游泳，打拳亦是功課之一，户外的運動，是和英文算學佔着同等重要的地位。</p>
<p>差不多十年以前，好萊塢名導演西席地米爾，和一般大明星們，和賈克霍爾脱，惠爾羅吉士，諾亞皮萊等，因為已故的體育專家宼蒂司，和教育家勃朋特等，計劃着設立一種學校，使兒童教育中，體力和思想並行發展，他們看了那種計劃極為贊同，就先將自己的子女，送到他們辦的學校裏去。這就是現在宼蒂司學校的創始了。</p>
<p>在較小的，或者是規模已具的城市之中，差不多没有人敢來倡議，設立這種維新式的學校的。但是在那時草萊初闢的好萊塢，他們覺得這種計劃，極合乎理論，他們就無所顧忌的着手進行了。果然一年方完，學生的父母都看了他們子女的成績而表示驚異起來。</p>
<p>在那個學校裏，就是幼穉園的小學生，都要練習游泳。等到進了小學，就叫他們練習外國文學。身體方面的缺陷，可以用操練來糾正。脾氣剛復憂悶的，可以化導為和善快樂。每個兒童體重的增加，普通的健康，腦筋的敏捷，都覺得成績斐然，使一般電影明星之為父母者，都紛紛將他們的子女，送到那個特别的學校裏去。就是有力的人家，不在影界作事的，亦都要將他們的子女送到那裏去。但是那個學校當局，以限於地位設備等等，仍維持了原有八十名的學額。</p>
<p>好萊塢一般影界人物對於該校的信仰和稱譽，可以將克萊芙勃羅克斯所説的話來證明一下。克萊芙勃羅克的女兒斐絲，和他的兒子小克萊芙，都在那個學校裏上學。他説：一這兩個孩子在那裏所得到的，是最良好的功課。但是良好的功課，在别個學校裏亦有的。這個學校的特點，使我贊成的就是它給與每個小孩子的身體方面的技巧，使他們長大了之後，不再為疾病所侵襲而䘮失或减少了人生的樂趣。他們非但教育兒童的腦筋，並且訓練兒童的筋骨。要是一個小小的孩子，懂得游泳，騎馬，滑冰，拍網球，打高爾夫，將來他們感覺到寂寞或不安的機會就少了。</p>
<p>克萊芙是不錯的。如果一個人的身體，和他的腦筋，一樣地受過了操練之後，他一生的生活，一定是很平衡而富有興趣的。</p>
<p>那是現任校長勃勞朋特確切不移的理論，亦是宼蒡司學校十幾位教師所共同深信的理想，亦是十餘年來各大教育家所測騐證明的，就是兒童體力的增加，能大大促進知識的發展的。勃勞朋特能够將學童的紀錄來證實這個理想，因為凡是宼蒂司學校裏的學生百分之八十順學到普通小學或中學去的，在各門功課上，都能插高一級至三級之多。</p>
<p>現在我們且將一個理想中的學生，自入學手續以至在校初期訓練的大概情形，叙述一下。譬如説，那個學生名字叫吉梅。他的母親是一位女明星。這個五嵗的吉梅，就是他母親眼中的寶貝，比公司裏的合同還要寶貝。有一天她帶領了吉梅去見校長勃勞朋特。她受着學校當局的平淡的招待，好像不知道她是紅極一時的女明星似的，或者有些生氣。</p>
<p>如果八十名的學額還没有滿的話，她就取到了一張查騐體格的空白證書，叫她夫請她的家庭醫師一項一項填寫好了，兩三天之内交來，同時受知識和心理的測騐。又如果她回去之後，對於學校當局平淡的招待不介意的話，普通是不會的，她過了兩三天，一定會帶領了吉梅再到那個學校裏來的。（未完）</p>

<p>蘇聯電影恊會，發起於本年二月間，在俄都莫斯科召集國際電影展覧會，並邀請遠東及歐美各國電影界，派遣代表，及選送作品，參加展覧。我國自得蘇俄當局邀請之後，曾由政府徵集各大公司代表作品，送交展覧。海上電影界人物之前往參加者，復有明星公司經理周劍雲，及影星胡蝶等。</p>
<p>兹據柏林二月二十一日電訊，德國政府亦擬於四月下旬在柏林召集一同樣性質之國際電影大會，並已致電於各岀産及放映影片之歐美遠東各國，邀請參加。該項邀請，已由德國政府中央電影局發岀，日期定為自四月二十五日至五月一日云。</p>
<p>並據德國電影局公佈消息各國所派遣之代表，不計本國代表在内，約共有八百餘人之多。此外若再加以本國代表，如德國國家電影恊會年會之代表等，則全球影業聞人，專家，影星等之齊集柏林，將超過一千五百人之譜，可云極一時之盛，或將超過蘇聯之電影展覧會云。</p>
<p>再則遠方各國代表之已前往莫斯科參加蘇俄之國際電影展覧會者，大部份將於展覧會閉幕之後，遨遊歐西各大名勝，至四月下旬再岀席柏林之世界電影大會，則一舉兩得，所費亦不鉅也。</p>

<h3 id="c219">「處女的日記」褒語 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 雲門</p>
<p>風流瀟灑第一流小生，洛勃蒙高茂萊，自從在「無名先生」，「俠友」，以及最近「山窮水盡」演岀以來，他始終保持着他那種風流藴藉，磊落輕鬆的優長。可是洛勃將在最新作品「舊約新盟」中，竟為他達觀的個性而兩度失掉他的愛人。不過這是後話，暫且不題。現「南京」公映之「處女的日記」蒙高茂萊與多才多藝安哈婷重度合作。這「處女的日記」為美國名戲劇家褒門氏N.S.Behman生平最受歡迎的作品，曾經在紐約百老匯劇院，繼續排演有八個月之久，可見其吸引力之偉大了。吾們試觀美國各報評論之態度，也應有佳劇難再之概，同時亦足以證明它在銀幕上的價值。以下是美國各報論調之一斑：</p>
<p>紐約阿美利堅報—「處女的日記」實在不止是一部絶妙的戲劇。當然它是本年度最成功的，最少數的作品之一。</p>
<p>紐約泰晤時報—這真是褒門氏宣示人類本性的最成熟的傑構。它是天一般崇高，海一般的淵深。</p>
<p>日報—「處女的日記」雖然是一齣曲折多致的喜劇，但劇中人各别的個性，已被褒氏描寫得淋漓盡致，饒有趣味的妙品。無疑地，它應列在「必看」之列。</p>
<p>紐約晚刋—拈筆寫來，入木三分。褒氏對於此間各類生命的觀察，可謂探幾剖微。</p>
<p>世界電訊—這部「日記」，吾僅能够採用兩字以批評它。那是「成年」和「誘惑」。（這兩字意義殊覺模稜）</p>
<h3 id="c220">亦將獻身銀幕的安娜史丹的丈夫 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>聽説安娜史丹的丈夫郁金法萊克博士（Dr.　Eugene　Frenke）將於最近的將來，成為好萊塢一個新的影藝人了。</p>
<p>這位俄國女明星的外子法萊克，在俄國的時候是一個建築家，所以除了到好萊塢後，和妻子做了一點電影劇本以外，可以説對於影業的經騐是完全没有的。可是他總想在影界裏幹點事，而他終於幹起來了。</p>
<p>他自己想做導演，可是他毫無經騐，自然没有一個製片家肯給他嘗試之機會的。因此他開始找非常有吸引力的故事了。恰巧那時候，康尼許博士—加州有名的科學家，成功於使一隻死狗復活。</p>
<p>這就是法萊克所需要的。假使把這新時代的驚異攝成影片，不是極有號召力的麽？於是他就寫起關於這大發見的有趣的電影劇本了。接着他又向康尼許博士得了將來攝片時，借用他實騐之結果的影片之允許。</p>
<p>一切都辦妥之後，他就到環球公司的老闆拉美爾處，商洽擬拍這部影片。拉美爾竟答應了他，不過説定這部影片只能用極少的代價攝製的。</p>
<p>這部影片—「Life　Returns」現在已經攝竣了。同時法萊克還證明了他的確是有非凡的導演天才的。雖然只費了十一天工夫，並且亦没有大明星在Cast裏，可是據看過的人説「Life　Returns」却是近來難得有的有趣的片子。</p>
<p>法萊克對新聞記者用着確信的口氣這樣説：「現在我能和妻子同在影界工作了。我們常是很要好地，很有理解地共同工作着。所以我相信我們倆一定能够在好萊塢做一點有意義的事的。」</p>

<p>有些人是一生不知失敗兩個字的，這種特質，就是密司露蘭貝爾斯夫秉之所具。不過露蘭貝爾斯的鬥争，並不是為他自己，而是為她的許多青年學生們。露蘭貝爾斯作了亞芳臺爾地方市立中學的校長，已經二十八年了。她雖然在這長年嵗月之中，覺到她身心的交瘁，但緬懷往昔，得有如斯成績，却也私衷竊慰。她自己亦記不淸多少次，她抱了决心而為她的「孩子們」鬥争，為他們的身體，思想和道德上的利益，為他們自己選擇娱樂的權制，為他們將來生活的根據。</p>
<p>她現在獨自一個人，坐在校長室裏寫字檯上，深思着最近所發生的一個新鬥争。她並不是愚人。她深知對方合併着對付她個人的力量。她深知無論這次鬥争的勝負，她都要償付無上的代價。她知道她自己已無路可擇。她疲倦的眼睛——她的聰明的，仁慈的，了解一切的眼睛——不覺注視到牆上掛的一塊木牌。那是一九零六年級畢業生合送於她的，上面燙着一行字：「見義即行—勇也。」</p>
<p>她看了不覺色然以喜。勇……義……不錯的，她肚子裏是具有這兩種東西的。管他什麽約瑟傑賴，當地最有勢力的人，富有錢財，開着一家亞芳台爾的報館。她知道他的不竭的財源，有許多不實不盡之處。她知道為什麽克拉倫斯戴德，就是克立克戴德的賭塲，能永久開着的縁故。她知道當地還有許多趨炎附勢之輩，一聲百諾的應聲蟲，許多當地的「政痞」，想舐瘡吮痔的瓜分些餘濶。她想着，自己頻頻摇着頭。她自己咬着自己的嘴唇。就是當地的學校視察員，賀倫特，都自己跑了來，親口警告她，不要過於熱心了，還是用些「外交手段」的好。</p>
<p>賀倫特對她説道：「密司貝爾斯，無論如何，戴德已經投資不少了……」貝爾斯立即駁覆道：「投資？我看起來，那是地方之害，惡勢力的造成。戴德的賭窟，不是我的孩子們的集會之所。」賀倫特將眼睛擠成了兩條縫，惡意的看着她問她道：「你到底有什麽憑據呢？」密司貝爾斯瞪着眼睛道：「憑據是没有。但是我一天不死，總有一天給我找到的！」</p>
<p>不錯的，她確已得到了證據……她微微地歎着氣，想起了……但也不抱怨她所付的代價和失敗。她却咬定了牙根立定了主意，一定要佔得最後之勝利。他們為什麽這樣糊塗。他們却不知道，她所最關心的，就是吉莉傑賴，約瑟傑賴的䘮母之女。吉莉是高中三年級的學生，容貌秀麗，但却驕縱成性，在一班同學之中，她總是一個領袖。吉莉心想，到戴德的地方去，是一種大胆有趣的行為。那裏有一個冰淇淋櫃台，外面看來是一個絲毫没有毛病的地方。但是在那冰淇淋櫃台的後面，却有一個「後房」，那裏面是克立克戴德售賣特别飲料之所。戴德在這裏面，並且引誘一班青年，從事於賭博之道。</p>
<p>密司貝爾斯有一天，想自己去和戴德理論去。他從前，亦做過她的學生。但是現在的戴德，明知自己有了護身符，不怕你一個老太婆有什麽法力。他對她哈哈大笑起來。但他却很喜歡她。無論什麽人，都免不掉喜歡她的。但是現在，密司貝爾斯看了戴德的神氣，知道她校長的威力，已經及不到這老學生的身上。她無路可走，祗好和他鬥争了。（未完）</p>

Tibet is eager to be integrated and extremely supportive of the central government. They earnestly hope that the Panchen Lama will return to Tibet to preside over affairs and will send representatives to Nanjing to thank the central government for its kindness. Therefore, the results of this trip were very good. The Panchen Lama intends to return to Tibet, but the date of his trip has not been determined. (24th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Academic Groups Telegraph Urging the Closure of the International Savings Society <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Twenty-two academic groups, including the Chinese Economic Society, issued a telegram on the 23rd regarding the closure of the International Savings Society. The original text reads: "To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Party Headquarters, Governments, Newspapers, Mass Organizations, and Fellow Compatriots throughout the Provinces, Cities, Counties: National savings should have legitimate channels and must not be carried out in a gambling manner. In particular, it is impermissible for foreigners to absorb the hard-earned money of our toiling masses through gambling-style savings within our country. Organizations such as the French International Savings Society in the commercial ports and the interior are truly alarming. How its organization and operating results are, the Chinese government is not allowed to supervise or ask about. Its content is rumored to be full of many loopholes, and there is no way to guess. However, the funds it has absorbed, excluding profits, have amounted to more than 65 million yuan and are currently increasing without end. Exhausting the country's fat to supply foreign merchants is a dangerous situation that does not need to be explained. It has recently been heard that the government has drafted a method for closure and is currently negotiating. By weighing the circumstances and reasoning, the French side should be able to consider the good relations between the two countries, the feelings and interests of our people, and international morality and justice, and accept it impartially. However, during this period, there are still things that our side should pay attention to, that is, the deadline for the closure of the society must be clearly stipulated and strived for the shortest possible time. Moreover, the refund of savings must absolutely not be left to the society to determine its own rules and arbitrarily discount. It must be calculated in full to ensure that depositors do not suffer any losses and to bring the trade relations between China and France into the right track in the future. Similar gambling-type dog racing tracks, etc., should also be abolished together, so that Chinese people have a good impression and friendship with France, then commerce can naturally become more prosperous, and diplomacy can become more benign. At this time when the lottery savings society has not yet closed, it is especially hoped that fellow compatriots who have not yet joined will absolutely not join again. Those who have already joined should not temporarily withdraw alone and let them hold them hostage. They should register separately by province and district, organize a depositors' union, and use the power of the group to assist the government as the backing of negotiations, striving to achieve the goal of recovering all the principal and interest of the savings and then stopping. At this time of national economic hardship, fellow compatriots can only endure hardship, accumulate bit by bit, and engage in legitimate production investments to save themselves. It is absolutely impossible to have a fluke mentality and harbor extravagant thoughts, and it is especially impossible to use the funds of sweat and blood for foreign merchants to take advantage of. We earnestly hope that the government and the people will work together to recover our rights and interests and actively eliminate all its gambling organizations in the future, exchange them for leakage, and cultivate the people's morality. This is indeed the key to saving the country."

<p>[Nanjing] The National Disaster Propaganda Team returned to Nanjing. The head of the team, Lin Xinmin, said, "From the surveys we have made over the past three years, we feel that all provinces have a common shortcoming in politics, that is, (corruption) has not been completely eradicated. In remote provinces, even county chiefs who are slightly far from the provincial capital want money and do not understand politics. A major case involving human life can result in the plaintiff being judged to have lost the case due to the power of money. A property case can result in statutory evidence being dismissed as waste paper. A certain border case in the past once caused a sensation, but in fact, it was because the adjutant wanted money, which aroused the rebellion of the Yi people, and the foreigners took the opportunity to instigate discord, almost leading to a major national problem. We entered Guizhou via Hunan. Regarding ethnic groups, the Miao people are the most numerous besides the Han people in each county, divided into raw Miao, cooked Miao, and embroidered ball Miao. The raw Miao and embroidered ball Miao will belong to the uncivilized, only controlled by the Tusi. They support themselves by farming and never enter the city. In terms of education in the province, 99 out of 100 people are illiterate. The climate in Yunnan is very mild, and women still practice foot binding. The Yi people are the most numerous besides the Han people in the province. In places like the Savage Mountain, there is still a type of the most undeveloped savages, who live under the cliffs and cliffs, and their buttocks still have the same tail as apes and monkeys. The educational situation in the province is the same as that in Guizhou. When we returned to Nanjing, we passed through the Annamse coastal defense. There are about 30,000 overseas Chinese living there, and each person must pay the colonial government 30 yuan of head tax every year. The King of Annam, under the control of the French colonial government, leads a carefree life and follows the Chinese Former Qing Dynasty's legacy of opening a department every year to recruit talents, recruiting Xiucai, Juren, Jinshi, and so on."

<h3 id="e20">Review of New Business Policies of Shanghai Money Shops <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The leaders of the money shop industry in this city, recognizing the inadequacy of past business policies to control the current difficult situation, convened a temporary meeting at the Nei Yuan on the 16th. They engaged in a thorough discussion of the present economic downturn and made decisions regarding new business policies, hoping to improve the environment and stabilize the foundation of the industry. These new business policies consist of three items. (See various newspapers of the 20th.)</p>
<p>(1) Of the collateral loans extended by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China to various money shops at the close of the last session, more than five million yuan remains unredeemed on schedule. These collateral loans are typically for a term of two months, after which they must be redeemed or extended. This causes the money shops to be constantly anxious and feel constrained. Therefore, the money shop industry now hopes that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China will extend the term to be settled every three months to facilitate circulation.</p>
<p>(2) Notify all money shops that they should not extend credit loans to businesses that purchase foreign goods, especially those that sell luxury goods. This is intended to reduce imports and indirectly reduce the large outflow of silver.</p>
<p>(3) Until the market returns to normal, each money shop should adopt the most cautious attitude in its business operations. It is especially important to be prudent with credit loans for businesses without restrictions to build up strength. At the same time, they should take measures to provide security for depositors from all sectors.</p>
<p>Looking at these three items, the first item concerns the extension of collateral loans. Although the second and third items both belong to changes in lending policies, each has its own reasons and effects. Please explain them separately.</p>
<p>(1) Before the closing of accounts in the 23rd year, four money shops, Rong Kang, Yi Kang, De Chang, and Bao Da Yu, suddenly declared bankruptcy one after another due to insufficient turnover. The impact of this event caused unprecedented tension in both the silver and money industries. If the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China had not released huge amounts of collateral loans, the panic might have spread even further. It is reported that the total amount of collateral loans was 6,667,000 yuan, with a term of seven days and a daily interest rate of two corners. It was distributed among 24 banks and money shops (including two small banks that also have relationships with the money shop industry). By the date of maturity, most of the money shops were unable to redeem due to the unusually tight money supply, and the extension has continued to this day, with more than five million yuan still outstanding. As a result, the New Year's lending rate for remittances opened at two fen on the red plate (February 8th). In less than two days, it rose to six fen and then to one jiao and one fen. Although it later dropped to one jiao due to the Hua Shang Bank providing some allotments, it has maintained a record of nine fen from the 16th to the present, which is unprecedented compared to the "white loan" of previous years. This phenomenon of apparent looseness but actual tightness is not a good sign for the future of the financial industry. Therefore, a small number of money shops have suggested extending the term for three months to make the market turnover more flexible. It is reported that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China are considering accommodating this idea, but there are concerns that the market may not be any better than it is today by the end of April.</p>
<p>(2) As for the notification to all money shops not to extend credit loans to businesses that purchase foreign goods, it seems that there are other intentions behind this as well. What is the reason? It is said that at the time of the bankruptcy of the four money shops, foreign merchants expressed doubts about the "credit of money shop notes." By the time new products were launched in the New Year, it was initially reported that foreign merchants refused to ship goods with long-term money shop notes. Later, it was said that only a small number of money shops could be trusted. All of these things were not entirely groundless rumors. However, from the perspective of the money shop industry, this action by foreign merchants is somewhat harsh. Now that the money shop industry has resolved not to extend credit loans to businesses that purchase foreign goods, it may be a strategy to counter foreign merchants, demonstrating passive resistance and seeking sympathy from various sectors within the country. However, the implementation of this policy must be supported by sound execution methods. There must also be considerable coordination with banks in the same industry to take the same steps in order to achieve practical results. Otherwise, abandoning this and taking that will inevitably fall into the trap of high-sounding rhetoric, leaving excuses for foreigners.</p>
<p>(3) The contraction of lending is one of the most important points of the new policy of money shops. This is related to the lifeline of the rise and fall of industry and commerce. When the news came out, the entire city was alarmed. Although Qin Runqing, the leader of the industry, gave a speech saying, "The business policy of each money shop this year... is because it suffered a great deal last year, so it must be determined based on its own strength. For example, after a serious illness, its diet must be based on whether it can digest it... gradually recover." He also said, "Various external rumors are not credible. The account books sent by each money shop have already begun. The reason why those who have not sent them are not because the money shops are unwilling to send them, but because of their own credit issues," and so on. (See this newspaper on the 21st.) Regarding Qin's speech this time, we seem to need to add a little bit. It is said that the contraction of lending has been a consistent policy of the financial industry, and it is rumored that a small number of money shops are preparing to sit down and pay for expenses and remittance interest for a year, implementing a cessation of lending. Given these facts, how can industry and commerce not fall into stagnation? Although various public organizations have repeatedly gathered to discuss remedies, the problem is ultimately serious. Chinese and foreign financial institutions only allow for the utmost assistance within the possible scope of real estate mortgages.</p>
<p>Moreover, the bankruptcy of these four money shops and the collection of accounts by the four money shops of Yin Tai, Yi Chang, Xin Kang, and Yong Feng are by no means just the individual problems of each shop. They are actually deeply related to the entire money shop industry. Further remedies depend on the self-awareness of the money shop industry itself. Comprehensive planning must be done for the internal organizational reforms and the concentration of financial and human resources in order to hope for the revitalization of the front lines. If they continue to be complacent, it will probably not be easy to achieve the effect of reversing the decline and reviving the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Franco-Austrian Compromise Reached After Talks in Paris <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>London Proposal Considered Indivisible</p>
<p>Agreement to Conclude Central European Convention Guaranteeing Peace Based on the Principles of the Rome Accords</p>
<p>Austrian Chancellor and Foreign Minister Leave France for London</p>
<p>[London] Since the German government issued an encouraging reply to the Anglo-French communique of February 3, European pacifism has once again made welcome progress today. The Franco-Austrian discussions in Paris have reached a complete compromise. The participants in the meeting were Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval from the French side, and Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Walterberger from the Austrian side. According to a statement issued tonight, "The authorities of the two countries met all morning, followed by the afternoon, and now they have agreed</p>
<p>(1) Both sides recognize the benefit of concluding a Central European Convention in a spirit of complete equality. The principles have recently been determined by France and Italy in talks in Rome.</p>
<p>(2) Both sides welcome the Franco-British compromise and regard this convention as a security factor. Together with other regional conventions, it can form a complete and indivisible guarantee of peace and facilitate the resolution of various outstanding issues."</p>
<p>After their success in Paris, the Austrian Chancellor and Foreign Minister prepared to leave for London that night for their first return visit. The Austrian Chancellor mentioned the long-standing friendship between Britain and Austria, saying that Austria wants and needs peace and the freedom to achieve its complete independence. The Austrians deeply feel that if there is no foreign interference, they will definitely succeed. The Austrian Foreign Minister also made pro-British remarks. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Statement Issued</p>
<p>[Paris] The Franco-Austrian talks have now concluded. According to the statement, the ministers of the two countries jointly studied the general political situation in Europe, and paid particular attention to various situations that can develop the confidence of the peoples of Central Europe and enrich the peace of Central Europe. France and Austria agreed to recognize the Franco-Italian Rome Accords, which have confirmed the principles of the Central European Convention. If the countries concerned can sign this convention in a spirit of complete equality, the benefits will be widespread. The recent Anglo-French London Agreement also recognizes the Central European Convention as a safety factor, and together with other regional conventions, it is a tool to guarantee peace and form a whole that is inseparable. This is particularly gratifying.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation and Cultural Cooperation As for the economic aspect, Austria has already concluded agreements with France and other countries, and the results are good and satisfactory. The statement concludes that France and Austria have agreed to hold negotiations soon in the hope of concluding a cultural agreement. Generally speaking, people commenting on the statement say that the Austrian government not only expressed its approval in principle of the Danube non-interference treaty, but also listed this treaty among various multilateral treaties, considering it "a tool to guarantee peace and form a whole that is inseparable." It can be seen that Austria has completely supported the position of the Anglo-French London Declaration. In addition, the statement mentions the words "spirit of complete equality," which shows that if the negotiations on the Danube Convention can be based on this spirit, its establishment will be easier.</p>
<p>Restoration Issue Not Involved As for the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg royal family in Austria, it was not mentioned in the talks. In short, the exchange of views between France and Austria has resulted in important progress and is beneficial to the cause of European stability. If they can act with sincerity and patience, all difficulties will eventually be overcome. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Austrian Prime Minister Visits Britain</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Franco-Austrian talks ended today, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Weithaler presented the Grand Cross of the First Class of Merit of Austria to Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval. In the evening, the Austrian Embassy held a grand banquet, to which important figures from both countries were invited. The Austrian ministers are scheduled to leave for London tomorrow, not only to exchange views on the European situation.</p>
<p>To Explore British Views on Political and Economic Issues Generally speaking, they will raise specific questions to the British authorities to find out what attitude Britain has toward Austrian economic and political issues. In general, it is believed that in terms of economics, the Austrian ministers will ask Britain to invest in building Austrian railways and use the purchase of a large number of British materials as an exchange condition. As for the political aspect, London political figures believe that the Austrian ministers will definitely inquire about Britain's views on the Central European Convention proposed by the Franco-Italian Rome Accords and the thorny issue of the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. Regarding the restoration issue, news from Vienna said that after the restoration is realized, Austria's efforts to unite the country will be easier to succeed. The British government will adopt a completely objective attitude on this, but it is not absolutely hostile, because no treaty prohibits the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. However, in practice, it is better to postpone the issue. In any case, the restoration issue and the Central European Convention are two completely separate matters and should not be confused. This is what we should pay attention to. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Explaining Domestic and Foreign Policy [Paris] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Weithaler met with the French press today and explained Austrian domestic and foreign policies. Chancellor Schuschnigg first reviewed Austria's struggles in the economic field since the overthrow of the empire, saying that the late Prime Minister Seipel first advocated the principle of cooperation among all ethnic groups in spirit and economy. Later, the late Prime Minister Dollfuss followed Seipel and maintained contact with the French authorities from beginning to end. "The policy of national connection does not mean melting all nationalities together, so that the nationalities of various countries lose their nature, but also that various countries compete with each other so that civilization progresses day by day. We firmly believe that this policy is of the utmost importance." Schuschnigg then stated that Austria should maintain complete independence both domestically and externally, saying that this is the main condition for guaranteeing peace. He then explained Austria's constitution and administrative reform measures, saying that some people believe that this is Austria's attempt to establish a dictatorial system, which is a fallacy. In fact, Austria only wants to make constitutional life and the legitimate needs of the people mutually compatible. "The Austrian government will not abandon itself and will not tolerate any political activities that deny the basic principles of the country. The maintenance of Austrian independence can only be better done by the new Austria." In conclusion, Schuschnigg stated that Austria's security has been restored by the power of the government. This is not only a material success, but also a great spiritual victory, etc. Then, Foreign Minister Weithaler explained that Austrian policy is dominated by two perspectives: to expand the scope of friendship as much as possible and to cooperate to maintain peace, etc. (Havas)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Comment with Uniform Satisfaction [Paris] The negotiations between the Austrian ministers and the French authorities ended last night, and all newspapers expressed satisfaction and sympathy for Austria. "Le Petit Parisien" said that France and Austria have the same ideas on the European security system. "L'Ere Nouvelle" commented on the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg royal family, saying, "The activities of the restoration party now seem to be a domestic issue specifically related to Austria and have nothing to do with international affairs. Only when the issue of the restoration of the capitals of Austria and Hungary leads to the reorganization of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire and makes the new countries that succeeded the old empire feel threatened can it be regarded as an international issue. However, the organizers of the new Republic of Austria will be able to deal with this danger, which the French government is deeply convinced of," etc. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Entrusted with Mission to Stabilize European Situation</p>
<p>Will Visit Capitals of Germany, Poland, and Russia</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon plans to visit Berlin, Moscow, and Warsaw in early March to hold talks with Germany, Russia, and Poland. Judging from the scope of his proposed talks, this trip will be the most important diplomatic mission since the European War. It is likely that Lord Privy Seal Eden will accompany the Foreign Secretary. They will not only discuss how to consolidate the foundation of European peace to make it more stable than the Treaty of Versailles, but will also consider issues related to the Far East. According to reliable sources obtained by the Associated Press today, Simon's trip has four purposes: (1) To clarify the opinions of Germany, Russia, and Poland on the European security plan in order to devise conditions that the three countries can jointly accept. (2) To ask Hitler to clearly state exactly how much military strength Germany requires and how much military equipment it will implement. (3) At the same time, Britain will also try its best to make France clearly state the same requirements, because France believes that Germany's manpower and industry are better than France's, so it must reserve leeway. (4) Russia's land and air forces have made great progress, which is also the main reason for Germany's request to increase military equipment. Therefore, Simon plans to know to what extent the strength of the Red Army can be reduced in order to make Germany abide by the military equipment treaty. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Troops Continue to Be Sent to East Africa</p>
<p>[Rome] Italy is now actively preparing for war and intends to meet Abyssinia on the battlefield. Italian troops are currently continuing to be sent to Italian Somaliland in East Africa. Last night, the Volcania ship carrying 2,000 Italian troops sailed from Naples and arrived in Messina this morning. From there, another 2,000 to 4,000 troops will be loaded to East Africa. In addition to various specialized personnel for war, the ship also carries doctors and staff from various parts of Italy. Massawa, the capital of Italian Eritrea in East Africa, is extremely tense due to Italy's urgent preparations for war. If Italy and Abyssinia declare war, Massawa will be the center of the Italian military's danger. It is built on a coral island in the Red Sea, with a levee of about one mile long connecting to the mainland. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Council of State met today and passed several bills to implement the colonial part of the Rome Agreement between Italy and France on January 7. (There are three conventions on colonies: (1) To resolve the status of Italian residents in French Tunisia in Africa. (2) and (3) To stipulate France's concessions on territory in Italian Libya to the south and Somaliland. The Council of State then approved the agreement previously signed by Italy with Britain and Egypt to demarcate the boundary line. Finally, the cultural agreements signed by Italy and Austria-Hungary were also approved by the Council of State. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Mussolini met with Libyan Governor Balbo today and inquired in detail about the Italian colonies in North Africa, such as the spiritual and material conditions of the local people (including Europeans and natives), the agricultural and commercial situation, and the planned reforms in colonial rule. In addition to praising Balbo's work, Mussolini gave various military instructions. Finally, Mussolini ordered the construction of a large road along the Libyan coast to connect the traffic between Egypt and Tunisia. This project is decided to start in the fourteenth year of the fascist government. In addition to sincerely thanking Mussolini for his concern and assistance to the colonies, Balbo stated that the Italians and natives in the colonies are eager for the Prime Minister to visit. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Le Journal published a special article today on Italy's management of East Africa, with many photos, to illustrate the work of the fascist rule in the colonies. The newspaper said that Italy's dispatch of troops to East Africa to protect its various construction projects in the colonies is a necessary measure. Italy has spent countless money on reclamation, road construction, water conservancy, and other projects in the Red Sea colonies. The tribes on the border of the Italian colonies are extremely rampant and pose a threat to the lives and property of Italians at any time. In theory, these tribes should be restrained by the Abyssinian government, but in fact, the Abyssinian government does not have this power. Therefore, it is impossible to seek a solution through diplomatic means. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>British Mediation</p>
<p>[Rome] Britain is still actively mediating the dispute between the two countries. British Ambassador to Italy Drummond held important consultations with Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich today on this issue.

<p>Negotiations Break Down</p>
<p>Cairo, Egypt According to news from the capital of Abyssinia, Italy and Abyssinia's negotiations on the organization of a mixed committee to determine the neutral zone have broken down due to Italy's opposition to the participation of European Abyssinian officials. Therefore, the current situation is very worrying. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

Yesterday, the Italian army commander notified the Abyssinian army commander that he had reported this matter to the government and is now waiting for the reply from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>[London] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain gave a speech in Bradford today, urging all countries to support the League of Nations. He said that what Britain is most concerned about is maintaining peace. The main point of the British government's policy is to consolidate and develop the League of Nations with all the means at its disposal so that it becomes an instrument for obtaining international cooperation and the only powerful instrument. People are too easy to speak out and criticize the League of Nations. It is important to know that the way to remedy its weaknesses is not to abandon the League of Nations, but to make persistent efforts to repair its weaknesses and improve its methods of operation. If possible, it should be made a more powerful tool in the future than it has been in the past, etc. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Asuncion The government announced today that Paraguay has declared its withdrawal from the League of Nations. Because Paraguay did not accept the League of Nations' mediation of the Chaco War, the League of Nations considered Paraguay an aggressor. Paraguay was greatly angered, which led to this. In addition, the League of Nations' proposal to lift the arms embargo on Bolivia while still prohibiting it for Paraguay is also a major reason for withdrawing from the League of Nations. In a notice sent to the League of Nations by the Paraguayan Foreign Ministry, it was said that the League of Nations regarded Paraguay's reply to the League of Nations' ceasefire as a rejection of the proposal and took decisive measures. In fact, Paraguay had not yet formally decided at that time, but only asked the League of Nations to reconsider some fundamental issues. Moreover, Paraguay has repeatedly requested the League of Nations to conduct a detailed investigation of the responsibility for the war, but the League of Nations has ignored it. Instead, it has lifted the arms embargo on Bolivia, helping Bolivia purchase military supplies. Therefore, Paraguay has no other way but to withdraw from the League of Nations. At the same time, the Paraguayan army has stepped up its attack on the Bolivian army in Villa Montes in the hope of capturing it before the deadline for the ceasefire set by the League of Nations expires tomorrow. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Capital of Paraguay The Paraguayan government has notified League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol that the country has decided to withdraw from the League of Nations. In November last year, the League of Nations Extraordinary Assembly made mediation proposals on the Chaco dispute. Bolivia immediately accepted, while Paraguay consistently rejected them. Therefore, the League of Nations Consultative Committee recently recommended that the previous ban on arms shipments to the Chaco be lifted for Bolivia and only applied to Paraguay as a sanction. This is probably the reason for Paraguay's withdrawal from the League of Nations. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is generally believed that since Paraguay withdrew from the League of Nations, the United States is prepared to conduct negotiations between Paraguay and Bolivia on the Chaco dispute, but will wait for Paraguay to make a request before conducting negotiations. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>General Masaki Plots to Overthrow Army Minister Hayashi</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency Tokyo Correspondence: The distribution of power within the Japanese Army is quite complex. Army Minister Hayashi and Inspector General of Military Education General Masaki have long been at odds. General Masaki belongs to the Southwest faction (mainly the Saga clique) and is skilled in conspiracy. After General Araki resigned as Army Minister, many of General Masaki's faction scattered far away. Therefore, they believe that they must take the position of Army Minister in order to save the situation and are plotting to overthrow Army Minister Hayashi. General Masaki is surrounded by many right-wing ronin, so they are mobilized to slander Army Minister Hayashi and Nagata, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, and other senior army officials. Moreover, Army Minister Hayashi did not provide economic assistance to the ronin. The right-wing groups, who have been praising the military, since the era of General Araki as Army Minister, also harbor great resentment towards Army Minister Hayashi. In order to achieve his goal of overthrowing Army Minister Hayashi, General Masaki conspired with political parties. In January of this year, Kuwabara Fusanosuke, the Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, secretly met with General Masaki at Nanpoin in Azabu Ward. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Tsugumo of the Seiyukai exposed the 500,000-yen embezzlement case at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. On the surface, it seemed to be an attack on Minister of Communications Tokonami, but the materials for the attack were provided by General Masaki's faction. Therefore, the main purpose was to accuse the military of lacking control, leading to the leakage of confidential documents to the outside world, and to force Army Minister Hayashi to resign. Therefore, it was rumored for a time that Army Minister Hayashi would resign in March. The trend of the two powerful figures fighting each other is of great interest.</p>

This booklet is expected to be completed on the 25th and will be distributed to schools and other influential groups throughout the country. The booklet will describe the situation of the 30th anniversary of the Russo-Japanese War, review the past, and clarify the origin of Japan's current emergency situation. It will also reveal the awareness that the people should have in the future. Because the Army's issuance of booklets had become a problem in the Diet, the Army authorities have carefully reviewed the content and wording this time. It is considered to be the most meaningful commemorative event and the booklet will serve as a major warning to the current domestic situation, likely attracting widespread attention. Therefore, the impact on various fields is expected to be significant. In particular, it can serve as a guide to the current chaotic political situation, and all parties are paying close attention to this. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>[Washington] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, has formally protested to the State Department against the egg sales tax proposed by Democratic Congressman Lee in the House of Representatives. The reason for the protest is that this tax is discriminatory against China, as the United States imports eggs almost exclusively from China. Although the sales tax is collected domestically, Lee's proposal only taxes imported eggs, which in effect increases the tariff by five cents per dozen for fresh eggs, 31 cents per pound for dried eggs, and 10 cents per pound for egg yolks and egg whites.

<p>Tashkent Correspondence: The Pamir Plateau is known as the "roof of the world." Previously, it was rarely visited, but now Soviet scientists frequently enter the hinterland for exploration. They have discovered rich deposits of silver, tungsten, and gold, and have also learned that crops can be cultivated at altitudes of 4,000 meters. In 1917, the Pamir had a total of 3,768 hectares of cultivated land; in 1934, it increased to 10,200 hectares. Crop yields have increased by one-tenth, and total production has increased from 27,000 poods to 78,000 poods. Threshing machines, harvesters, and other machines have been discovered in the mountains. Farmers in eastern Pamir use tractors to cultivate wasteland. Before the revolution, the people of the area suffered greatly from food shortages, with mulberry cakes being the main food. Now, the area can be self-sufficient in food for at least nine months of the year. In terms of transportation, until 1932, people had to ride horses to various villages and towns in the Pamir, taking a full month. Now, there is a new highway of 750 kilometers between Osh and Khorog. Khorog also has a power plant. Major Soviet cities can now communicate with the Pamir via radio. There is also an air route between Stalinabad and Khorod. Currently, there are 142 schools in the Pamir, with 5,000 students, whereas before the revolution there were only two schools. Khorog has a normal school with 90 students, as well as theaters and cinemas. Local witch doctors have been eliminated and replaced by modern doctors. There is also a sanatorium at an altitude of 2,000 meters. In short, the primitive life of the Pamir has gradually transformed into a healthy and cultured life. (TASS, January 27)</p>

<p>France's greatest fear is the resurgence of Germany. If Germany truly revives, it will surely seek revenge against France. Over the past year (1934), the Austrian issue in Central Europe has been difficult for France to handle, and Italy and Germany have frequently shown signs of potential rapprochement. Regarding the Mediterranean hegemony and the contention for supremacy in Central Europe, France and Italy are in an irreconcilable situation. Former Foreign Minister Barthou traveled extensively but ultimately lost his life. His work remained unfinished. His successor, Laval, naturally followed the previous policies and expedited them. In other words, he tried to eliminate the rift between France and Italy and complete the encirclement of Germany.</p>
<p>Before the Saar plebiscite, France had put in a lot of effort, but she herself understood that the administrative power over this region could not be held by France, because the majority of the vote would result in its affiliation with Germany. Therefore, on the one hand, France suggested that the price for mining the coal in the Saar region for five years would amount to 900 million francs, and the excavation costs for the two Walrand coal mine entrances located within France would amount to 45 million francs. If the Saar returned to Germany, Germany would have to repay this amount. However, such a huge sum of money is something that impoverished Germany could not bear. Furthermore, before the Saar people's general vote, France had first made preparations for European diplomacy—establishing an understanding with Italy, making concessions to Italy in North African and East African colonies, and ceding nearly 100,000 square miles of territory to ease the conflict between France and Italy. This was truly a clever move. In this way, France won over Italy and eliminated a large part of the German threat. Except for Poland, all the countries surrounding Germany on the European continent were aligned with France. Even the Soviet Union, which was previously very incompatible with France, is now an ally of France. Therefore, in any case, France and the Soviet Union will not diverge on the issue of Germany. However, the infighting between France and Germany, the purchase of the Saar coal mines, and the guarantee of Austrian independence all pose problems. Therefore, rather than saying that the establishment of the Franco-Italian agreement reduced the crisis in the European political situation, it is more appropriate to say that it is preparing for a greater disaster to erupt in the future.</p>
<p>France holds a huge amount of cash, second only to the United States. At the end of November 1934, the cash reserves amounted to 82,097 million francs. However, the financial situation remains very difficult. In 1933, the state treasury's revenues and expenditures could not offset each other, and the shortfall reached 16 billion francs. Such a huge deficit is something that has probably never been heard of in our motherland. In February 1934, the Doumergue national unity cabinet was established. As a result of reorganizing the finances, the budget still had a shortfall of 18.8 billion francs. Since the financial situation has deviated from the norm, its impact on the general public is naturally very severe. Moreover, the French political arena is full of small parties, and no single party can obtain a majority of seats in parliament. Therefore, politics are always constantly fluctuating, and society cannot be stable. The economic instability is particularly obvious.</p>
<p>The economic instability in France is due, on the one hand, to the impact of foreign countries reducing the value of their currencies, resulting in more imports of foreign manufactured goods and the suppression of domestic manufactured goods exports. On the other hand, France, deeply aware of the lessons learned from the excessive issuance of banknotes since the European War, dared not easily implement a policy of currency inflation, so it had to adhere to the gold standard. As a result, wages were reduced, the number of unemployed people increased, and the voices of dissatisfaction from the working class with the current situation permeated everywhere. In rural areas, due to restrictions on imports and increased tariffs, purchasing power declined instead, while the prices of agricultural products fell, causing farmers to live in poverty and feel dissatisfied with the current situation.</p>
<p>France's industrial production (with 1928 as the base year) was still at 83.5 in January of last year, but it fell to 78.0 in June, and further to 74.0 in October. Wholesale prices (with 1913 as the base year, paper currency price index) were 405 in January of last year, but fell to 356 by the end of November, while retail prices fell by 16.4 percent during the same period. Exports decreased by nearly 600 million francs, and imports decreased by almost 600 million francs, which shows the decline of its trade situation. Given France's accumulation of a large amount of cash, it has no choice but to maintain the gold standard. However, maintaining the gold standard puts pressure on the industrial economy, and domestic economic prosperity cannot be stimulated by any means. As a result, the economic crisis deepens, and the gold standard also faces a crisis, which has a considerable adverse impact on its political situation. (January 24, 1935, in Paris)</p>

<h3 id="e68">An Overview of the Recent Turmoil in Xinjiang (3) <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Hami Mountain Tangle Incident, initiated by the conversion of local hereditary chieftainships into centrally administered districts, served as the trigger for the turmoil. Its leaders were primarily chiefs under the jurisdiction of the Duo Wang Mansion. (1) Hejia Niyazi, who had made a pilgrimage to Mecca (the holy site of Muhammad), held a high position in the religious community. The Tangle people respectfully referred to Hejia as "Aji." He held an unspecified position in the Wang Mansion. (This reporter inquired with Dr. Yao Le about He's past career. Yao replied that he had previously served the old Wangye, but now he has risen to become the vice chairman of the new provincial government.) After the incident broke out, he commanded a large following. (2) Dr. Yao Le, whose original name was Yao Lobasi, was the son of a Xiang man and a Tangle woman. He was proficient in both Tangle and Chinese. He had been to places like Beiping and Hankou. During the incident, he served as the battalion commander of the Sha Wang's Tangle soldiers. He is now the garrison commander of the Hami Township District. He employs a Chinese secretary and changed his name to Yao Le Boshi. He is known to be alert and straightforward. (3) Sima Yi, the treasurer of Sha Wang, has the air of a politician. (4) Other figures included Grand Ahong, Da Er Gua, and Ismail, the company commander of Little Wang Niezi'er.</p>
<p>The incident dragged on for more than a year. The provincial authorities, finding it inconvenient to march through the Tianshan Mountains, feared further escalation. The Tangle side, having witnessed Ma Zhongying's retreat to Gansu, also sought a peaceful resolution. They negotiated a settlement whereby the provincial government would allocate 100 shi of wheat and 40,000 taels of silver to enable the Tangle farmers affected by the famine to return to the mountains for spring planting. In return, the Tangle people would surrender 2,100 firearms to demonstrate their commitment to non-resistance. Later, the provincial authorities handed over all the wheat funds to Hejia Niyazi. (Some say the funds were not fully disbursed.) He only allocated a portion to his own subordinates, leaving Yao Le's troops uncompensated, which triggered internal repercussions among the Tangle people. Ismail even plotted to capture Yao Le and present him to He. He said, "The common enemy has not been eliminated. Why must we turn against each other?" He also could not bear to see his own people harm each other and released Yao without killing him. However, the infighting continued unabated. The provincial army, seeking to exploit the situation, seized the opportunity to encircle and suppress Yao's forces. Other tribes were also willing to surrender their weapons as agreed. Little did they know that when the deadline arrived, not a single gun was handed in, and instead, each tribe reunited with Yao to resist the provincial army. The provincial army, unprepared, suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>From then on, the Tangle people established contact with the remnants of Ma Zhongying's forces and further planned to attack Shanshan and Qijiaojing. The provincial authorities urgently dispatched Xiong Fayou's regiment, garrisoned in Zhenxi, to move to Qijiaojing. By that time, Shanshan had already fallen to the insurgent Ma Shiming. The Chinese civilians who failed to escape or who had not accompanied the army from Zhenxi mostly suffered a catastrophe. Xiong's regiment then applied the same methods to the Tangle and Hui people they encountered. Subsequently, they retreated to Turpan, unaware that Ma Shiming, Ma Dexiang, and other troops stationed there and in Yanqi had allied with the Tangle people and laid an ambush. Xiong's regiment, unaware, was completely annihilated. This is what is known as the Turpan Rebellion. The provincial authorities, realizing that the war was escalating daily, and Hami was located 1,400 to 1,500 li away, making transportation difficult, supplies inadequate, and the battle lines too long, ordered Li Hairu's division in Hami to withdraw westward in the spring of the 22nd year. First, they joined forces with the Eastern Frontier Army in Dihua to recapture Turpan, and then they were transferred north to garrison Guchengzi, leaving Hami empty.</p>
<p>After Turpan was recaptured, the Tangle people, following the Tianshan Mountains and the Fan Da Ban, suddenly infiltrated Hongmiaozi, which was more than 20 li away from the provincial capital (Dihua). They colluded with the local Tangle people, took the opportunity to encircle the airport, burned two airplanes, and besieged Dihua for three days and nights. This led to the massacres in Nanguan and Xidaqiao. Sheng Shicai, who currently holds an important position in the Xinjiang military and political circles, was recruited into Xinjiang in the 19th year when Jin Shuren deeply felt that military affairs were not his forte. Sheng served as the chief of staff in the governor's office. The following year, he was promoted to chief of general staff. As the Hami Incident expanded, Sheng was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression campaign, presiding over military affairs at the front. By that time, it had been three years. As the provincial capital was in danger, the provincial army concentrated its defenses in the Dihua area. Sheng was ordered to pursue and attack the Tangle people and Ma Shiming's and Ma Dexiang's troops in the Nanshan Mountains. At that time, transportation was cut off, and news was extremely bad. The eastern and northern routes were in a critical situation. Moreover, rumors of Ma Zhongying's main force attacking Xinjiang again were spreading rapidly and were gradually being confirmed. Therefore, Chen Zhong, Tao Mingyue, Zhao Deshou, and other central military investigators claimed that the turmoil in Xinjiang could not be quelled unless Jin Shuren left. They contacted the military and civilians and launched a surprise attack on the major military and political organs and the provincial government in the provincial capital at 1:00 PM on April 12th. Before dusk, they had occupied all the important locations.</p>
<p>Jin Shuren was completely unaware of the situation beforehand. The mutiny broke out suddenly. The provincial government's guards could not resist and fled through the back door of the provincial government, seeking refuge in the First Public Security Bureau, and then to Meng's regiment, the garrison in the west city. He was ordering the Guihua Army artillery unit to come and defend when suddenly artillery shells began to fly in frequently. Upon discovering that they were from the Guihua Army, he retreated in alarm outside the city to Hongshanzuizi, gathered his core troops, and launched a counterattack, but he was still unsuccessful. He retreated to Suilai and then traveled by car to Tacheng. A Russian consul in Tacheng was extremely friendly with Jin and was willing to help Jin return to the province with effective measures. Jin immediately telegraphed Zhang Peiyuan, the reclamation commissioner in Yili, intending to seek assistance. However, Zhang replied in a telegram, saying, "Inviting a wolf into the house could lead to a big mistake. You should quickly come to Yili and make other plans." At the same time, Lu Xiaozu, the former secretary-general of the provincial government and one of Jin's former subordinates (who was also in Tacheng at the time), also strongly dissuaded Jin, saying that "seeking foreign aid for temporary expediency may bring condemnation to future generations." Jin then realized the situation and quietly left Xinjiang through Russian territory, without thinking of making a comeback.</p>

<p>The day after the mutiny suddenly broke out, Sheng Shicai, who was fighting in Wulapai (in the Nanshan Mountains, 40 li south of Dihua), was summoned back by Jin by airplane and stopped at "Yipao Chenggong" (a place name) north of the city. Jin requested a face-to-face meeting, but Sheng dared not go. Sheng's attitude then became clear. After Jin left, 38 representatives from all sides and all ethnic groups formed a Provisional Maintenance Committee and elected Liu Wenlong, the director of the Department of Education, as the provisional chairman, Sheng Shicai, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression campaign, as the provisional governor, and Zheng Runcheng of the Northeast National Salvation Army as the garrison commander of Dihua. Liu and Sheng jointly issued a notice to appease the people, stating the significance of the mutiny and listing three conditions: (1) protecting the lives and property of the Jin family, (2) protecting the consulates, and (3) protecting the lives and property of people of all ethnic groups and the Guihua Army. People in the new provincial government said that the overthrow of the old government and the establishment of the new government were based on the success of the April 12th mutiny in the 22nd year, and therefore designated that day as "April 12th Revolution Commemoration Day."</p>
<p>Sheng had only been in Xinjiang for three years and was suddenly in command of the military. He claimed that the April 12th mutiny was unexpected, as he was commanding the military at the front and had no knowledge of it beforehand. However, on the eve of the mutiny, he dreamed of Jin wearing a monk's hat and robes, inviting him to sit in a remote room in a mountain village. Jin immediately slammed the door shut and left. When he woke up, he did not understand the meaning at first, but later he realized that the previous dream was not without cause and effect. In previous years, when Yang Zengxin was in charge of Xinjiang, his subordinates cast a bronze statue to celebrate his birthday, with the words "General Yang's Bronze Statue" engraved on it. (Since Yang's supervision of Xinjiang, the military and civilians have all referred to him as General Yang. Even today, the Tangle and Hui people in Hami still refer to him as the old general.) During the unveiling ceremony in the park, Yang himself was in the front row. When he suddenly saw the statue, which was covered with gold leaf, he did not resemble his true face in Lushan. He blurted out, "Is this General Yang? It's General Jin!" As he spoke, he looked back and saw Jin Shuren standing behind him in formal attire. Everyone then spread the rumor that it was a prophecy of future events. This time, the April 12th mutiny was also preceded by Sheng's dream. People in Dihua also liked to compare it with Yang's statue, saying that everything is predestined and that it was a coincidence. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chen Cheng, Yu Xuezhong, and Others Have All Arrived</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou from Jiangxi on the 21st and stayed at the Central Bank. In recent days, he has received Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Qian Dajun, Ye Peng, Chen Xizeng, and others, inquiring about the anti-bandit policies and the security situation in Wuhan. He also telegraphed Chen Cheng, the commander of the 18th Army, Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of Hebei Province and commander of the 51st Army, Wan Fulin, the commander of the 53rd Army, Wang Shuchang, the commander of the Pingjin Garrison, and others to come to Hankou. Chen left Jiangxi on the 22nd aboard the Minxing express steamer and arrived in Hankou at 6:00 PM on the 23rd. Yu, Wan, and Wang also arrived at 6:30 PM by special express train from Pingjin, accompanied by Liu Zhe, the former Minister of Education, Miao Chengliu, Guo Xipeng, Huang Xiansheng, and other division commanders. They were all scheduled to meet Chiang on the 24th. Chen Jicheng, He Zhuguo, Wang Yizhe, Hao Mengling, and other division commanders, who were already in Hankou waiting to meet Chiang, remained in Hankou, except for Chen, who had returned to Puqi. As for those who are about to come to Hankou but have not yet arrived, there is Xu Yuanquan. Xu originally planned to fly east on the 23rd, but due to unforeseen circumstances, he first sent his chief of staff, Yang Shaodong, to Hankou to represent him in meeting Chiang and report on military affairs. Xu himself will depart from Shashi within a few days. In addition, Liu Zhi and He Jian, the chairmen of Henan and Hunan provinces, and Yang Hucheng, the pacification director of Shaanxi and Suiyuan, have also been reported to be coming to Hankou. Chairman Chiang's arrival in Hankou this time is with the determination to eliminate the remaining bandits. He will wait for all the generals to arrive, personally instruct them, and attend the enlarged memorial week training at the headquarters on the 25th. All civil officials above the section chief level and military officers above the rank of captain will participate.</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, gave an interview to reporters, stating, "We have been summoned to Hankou to report on military and political affairs to Chairman Chiang and Vice Commander Zhang, and to request instructions on everything. We do not plan to attend the establishment ceremony of the Wuchang General Headquarters and will return north immediately. Regarding the Luan Dong Incident, it has now come to an end. The security forces in the war zone have been fully organized, totaling 5,000 men. The timing of their entry into the war zone has not yet been determined and is currently under negotiation. The joint office of the various departments and bureaus of the Hebei Provincial Government will be implemented on April 1st. The relocation of the provincial government to Baoding is difficult to schedule at present. Regarding the issue of the boundary demarcation between the province and the city, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Executive Yuan has ordered the provincial and municipal governments to consult and demarcate the boundary. After consultation between representatives from both sides, the provincial government advocates maintaining the original boundaries, while the municipal government believes that the urban area should be expanded. Therefore, no decision has yet been made. The issue of establishing a city in Tangshan will be shelved due to insufficient population and failure to meet the conditions for establishing a city."

<h3 id="e71">Recent Situation of Bandit Suppression in Eastern Fujian <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>—Shen and Liu's Brigades Have Both Telegraphed Victories—</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Wang Jingjiu, the commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone stationed in Fujian, believed that the banditry in Lianjiang and Luoyuan counties along the coast of eastern Fujian, and in Gutian and Nanping counties along the river in northern Fujian, was rampant. He specially dispatched Shen Fazao's brigade and Liu Anqi's brigade to encircle and suppress them separately. According to the reports from Shen and Liu's brigades, the bandit suppression situation is very smooth. The details are recorded below: (1) Shen's brigade telegraphed that, in recent days, they have been supervising the Qingxiang (clearing the villages) in the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts of Lianjiang and Luoyuan counties and handling the Baojia system. A total of more than 200 bandits have been captured. In addition to more than 30 major bandits who were shot dead on the spot and more than 50 who were sent to the county government, the rest were released after being allowed to reform themselves. A total of more than 300 people have voluntarily come forward to seek self-reformation. More than 70 firearms have been seized. Upon investigation, the Wei Geng bandit gang had about 200 firearms. We have captured more than 70 firearms and scattered more than 60. There are now no more than 80 firearms remaining, about two-thirds of the losses. They have fled to the Western Ocean Island and have been tracked and pursued by our troops. (3) Liu's brigade telegraphed that, among the bandit gangs in Nanping and Gutian counties, Wei Jianlong's faction has the greatest strength. They specialize in intercepting passing ships and wooden rafts along the Minjiang River and levying military rations. Troops have been dispatched in recent days to search and advance along the river. The bandits have retreated into the mountains. Our troops have dispatched teams to encircle them. The bandits are in disarray due to the cut-off of food supplies. Yesterday, another company was dispersed by Li's battalion. The false company commander, Yang Ziming, was shot and killed. Peng Ziang, the largest faction entrenched in Shanyang on the border of Gutian, has expressed sincerity to Jia's battalion and requested permission to surrender their weapons and reform themselves, and to be given security guarantees. This has been accepted. There are few remnants of Wei's bandits remaining, and they will be wiped out soon. The Baojia system will be reorganized and a militia will be organized to strengthen local self-defense. As for the Red bandits in eastern Fujian, the factions of Ma Liefeng (i.e., Li Feng) and Feng Pintai are the most powerful. Ma's bandits have been killed by Ma Hongxing's troops of the Third Security Regiment, and more than half of his troops of more than 1,000 have scattered. Feng's bandits have only 600 or so men remaining and have fled to the Pingxi, Hutou, and Wuting areas under the jurisdiction of Shouning County. (February 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Jinan's Filial Daughter Enters Prison in Place of Her Mother <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>A Teenage Girl's Heartfelt Plea Regarding a Family Property Dispute</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhou Hanzhang of Jiyang was accused by his brother's wife of seizing property and forcing a marriage due to a family property dispute. Zhou went out to make a living, causing his wife, Zhou Hao, to be detained in the military law office. His daughter, Zhou Qingzhen, 16 years old, was extremely saddened and voluntarily requested to enter prison in place of her mother. Shi Jingzhou, the director of the military law office, was sympathetic to her filial piety and, given that the case involved a family dispute, today (22nd) specially approved Zhou Hao's release on bail to go home for medical treatment. Her family dispute will be entrusted to Zhou Hanzhang's father for handling. If it still cannot be resolved, the military law office plans to send the case to the court for handling. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou's Family History: Qingzhen's father, Hanzhang, and mother, Hao, are from Zhoujialou Village, Jiyang County. The Zhou family is a prominent family with four brothers: Hanting, Hanzhang, Hanjue, and Hanwen. Hanting and Hanjue died early, and Hanwen is still young. Hanting was adopted by his uncle, Yunshan, who lived at No. 94 County East Alley in Jinan City. His wife, Chen, had no children, so they adopted Hanzhang's son, Qingyu, as their son. Hanzhang, seeing that his widowed sister-in-law and young son could not manage the family affairs, managed them on their behalf. His uncle, Yunshan, was in charge of Qingletang, and Hanzhang's brothers were in charge of Changle tang. They had already separated and lived separately for many years. Although he managed the family affairs on behalf of his son, the properties were separate and not mixed. Later, Hanzhang's father, seeing that his children were grown up, advocated that each should establish their own household. Except for Hanting, who was adopted, Hanzhang, Hanwen, Hanjue's wife, Ma, and the elderly couple were separated into four shares, and 120 mu of land were divided equally, with each share receiving 30 mu, which was enough to make a living. Hanting's family inherited his uncle's business and was known to be wealthy, with more than 200 mu of land. In addition to the house in County East Alley, there was also a house in Jinjuxiang. Zhou Chen gave up the house in Jinjuxiang, leaving it to her parents-in-law. She treated Zhou Ma's two daughters and Hanzhang's daughter, Qingzhen, as her own. After the chaos was over, Zhou Ma wanted to go home, but they could not keep her. She took her two daughters straight back to Jiyang and suddenly accused Zhou Hanzhang of seizing property and forcing her to marry in the military law office of the Third Route Headquarters, claiming that her family had not separated and that Hanzhang had seized several qing of land (including Hanting's land), 300,000 yuan in deposits in Shanghai Bank and HSBC Bank, and forced her to remarry. At that time, Zhou Hanzhang had already gone out to make a living and had not been summoned. His wife, Zhou Hao, and daughter, Qingzhen, lived at the home of her mother, Hao Pin, in Zhenying Street. On the 14th of this month, Zhou Ma and her two daughters went to Zhou Hao's house. In the midst of talking and laughing, she secretly had her daughter report to the Public Security Bureau, saying that Zhou Hanzhang's family was hiding military supplies. Soon after, the police arrived and searched, but found nothing. They then sent Zhou Hao to the General Bureau of Public Security, and then transferred her to the military law office for detention, pending investigation.</p>
<p>A Tragedy: Zhou Hao has dropsy and dysentery. After entering prison, her condition worsened. The day after her detention, her daughter, Qingzhen, went to visit her. Zhou Hao was extremely surprised and said, "How did you, a weak little girl, get here?" The girl, who had studied poetry and books, should explain to her mother that she was willing to imitate Han Ti Ying's story and enter prison in place of her mother, asking her mother to go home for medical treatment. Her mother refused, saying, "This is your filial piety, and I am very happy, but it is not allowed by law. Your father has been falsely accused, and since he is not in Jinan, I should attend the hearing on his behalf. How can you, a weak person, replace me? It is absolutely impossible." At that time, the girl had just recovered from measles. Her mother urged her to go home, but the girl refused, and they embraced and cried bitterly. Everyone watching was moved to tears. Finally, the girl obeyed her mother's order and went home. That night, she drafted a memorial and sent it to the military law office, willing to enter prison in place of her mother, so that her mother could go home for treatment. The memorial stated, "According to the government doctor, her condition is not light. Upon hearing this, my heart and soul were torn apart. If she dies as a result, my mother and daughter will be buried underground, and what face will I have to live in this world? Rather than both of us dying, it is better to replace the old with the young."</p>
<p>Mother and Daughter Reunite: After the memorial was submitted, Shi Jingzhou, the director of the military law office, found the wording heartfelt and, given that the case had no basis in fact, approved her release on bail to go home. Today (22nd) morning, Zhou Hao has returned home, and mother and daughter have reunited. However, Zhou Hao's face is yellow and thin, and she is haggard and pitiful. Zhou Chen is very angry about Zhou Ma's false accusation against Zhou Hanzhang and is preparing to appeal. According to reports, the reasons she has provided are: (1) Zhou Hanzhang did not have any military supplies. (2) Hanzhang has no private property. What Zhou Ma pointed to was probably my family property. (3) Hanzhang only had 30 mu of land that he was entitled to inherit and did not seize my family property or Zhou Ma's family property. (4) The Zhou family has lived separately for three generations, and there is evidence of this. Zhou Ma is actually coveting other people's property, so she took this path and was undoubtedly instigated by others. Previously, seeing that I was widowed and living in difficulty, I had intended to divide several dozen mu from my 170 mu of land, but she refused to acknowledge this. I did not expect that she had ulterior motives and would take such action. (22nd)</p>

<p>The Anti-Smoking Association Orders Smokers to Quit</p>
<p>The county's Anti-Smoking Committee, in order to give unlicensed smokers a chance to reform themselves, began to accept smokers' voluntary surrenders on the 21st in accordance with provincial orders, and established two rehabilitation centers to allow the smokers who surrendered to enter the centers to quit smoking. Since the start, only a few people have surrendered, less than ten. The county government has now decided to search smokers' homes from today onwards. Anyone who is unlicensed will be ordered to enter the rehabilitation centers to quit smoking.</p>

<p>Investigation of Food Transportation by the General Staff</p>
<p>The National Defense Design Committee of the Nanjing General Staff Headquarters has recently dispatched Zhang Wenduo to investigate the food and various transportation conditions in eleven counties including Wujin, Wuxi, Wu County, Jiading, Qingpu, Songjiang, Jinshan, Liuhe, Yizheng, Nantong, and Taixing. They have specifically requested the provincial government to instruct the above counties to provide full assistance and convenience when the said official arrives. Yesterday, Zhang Wenduo arrived in Wuxi from Nanjing to liaise with the county government and the Chamber of Commerce and conduct thorough investigations into the rice and bean storage businesses and shipping industries.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Land Survey in Five Counties</p>
<p>The Land Bureau of Jiangsu Province is organizing a province-wide land survey. The first phase, involving counties such as Wuxi, has been largely completed. The second phase involves eleven counties including Taicang, Shishan, Nantong, and Siyang. It was originally scheduled to start in April this year. However, it is reported that due to the early completion of the first phase counties, the second phase involving five counties, including Taicang, Chuansha, Baoshan, Chongming, and Wujiang, will be started earlier. Currently, a land survey team has been established in Wujiang, and guide wire surveying has been established in Taicang and the other four counties. The provincial bureau issued team emblems a few days ago to ensure credibility. Furthermore, Bureau Chief Zhu Ping stated that as land surveys in various counties are being completed successively, there is a need for many draftsmen and calculators for the preparation of various land maps and registers. Yesterday, he specifically recruited thirty people each for drafting and calculation, with the examination scheduled to be held at the bureau in Sanguantang, Zhenjiang, starting on March 11.</p>
<p>Robbery and Assault in the Eighth District</p>
<p>In the Guojia Township, Changding Bridge area of the Eighth District, the families of Wu Qiaobao, Wu Agen, and Zhu Xiaobao, who are neighbors and engaged in farming, were targeted. It is reported that around 1:00 AM the night before last, more than a dozen bandits suddenly broke into Wu Qiaobao's house, forced the door open, pulled out pistols, silenced the occupants, and ransacked the house. Subsequently, they went to the homes of Wu Agen and Zhu Xiaobao and continued to rob them. The total losses amounted to more than one hundred yuan. Later, Shao Caibao, a neighbor, heard the noise, came out, and sounded the gong to raise the alarm. The villagers came out to catch the bandits, who fled with the stolen goods, firing several shots into the air as a warning. However, Shao Caibao bravely pursued them and was shot in the buttocks by a bandit with a live bullet. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. After receiving the alarm, the Third Sub-station directly under the Public Security Bureau went out to pursue the bandits. At dawn, they intercepted a bandit boat near Xizhuang Bridge and found two bullets on the boat. However, the bandits had all escaped without a trace. The bandit boat and bullets were handed over to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Drug Production Operation</p>
<p>Fan Shilin, a native of Wanshan Township, south of Xinmu Bridge outside the East Gate of this county, opened a teahouse in the township, collected commissions for gambling, and also organized a drug production operation to manufacture red pills and traffic them to various places. The rumors have been circulating for many years. Because of his powerful means, he has not been caught. The year before last, he had a dispute with his accomplice, Lu Amao from Baoshan, over a romantic affair. Fan instigated his gang to beat Lu to death and move the body to Baojie. The case has not been solved yet. Lu's wife, Ms. So-and-so, was unwilling to let it go and secretly reported Fan's drug production operation to the Baoshan County Detective Team. On the 21st of this month, Team Leader Wang and more than 30 policemen, accompanied by Lu's wife, took two boats and secretly ambushed near Fan's house. Around 5:00 PM, they surrounded and searched the house. Fan heard the alarm in his sleep, put on his clothes, got up, and opened fire with a pistol, resisting fiercely and trying to escape. However, the pursuers had densely surrounded him, and he was eventually captured. Eighteen packets of red pills and a pistol were seized in his house. Most of his gang members fled. It is now known that the suspect and the seized items have been sent to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Petition to Reduce and Postpone City Land Tax</p>
<p>The land survey in Jiangdu has been completed and the land tax in the urban and rural areas will soon be levied. Local residents, such as Zhu Zhuxuan, feel that the local people are poor and have exhausted their resources. The sudden imposition of this tax is something the people cannot afford. They have jointly submitted a petition to the County Party Department, requesting that it suggest to the County Government to reduce the land tax and postpone the grain levy. The reasons for the petition are: (1) Jiangdu has always been a strategically important place since its history. Whenever there is a military conflict, the markets are reduced to ruins. There has never been a land tax. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, the markets were restored, and only rent was paid for the land. The land tax was exempted due to the salt merchants' contribution of huge sums of money. In recent years, with the implementation of land administration, the authorities have proposed to collect grain in the city. It is heard that the households with taxable residential land will be levied, and the collection of grain is indicated on the printed list with the city map. Each mu is levied one qian, four fen, and five li of labor, and five sheng and five he of rice, totaling about two or three yuan. It will be levied in the 24th year, and those who hear about it are indignant and those who talk about it change color. Those who are involved are unable to bear it, and every household cries out, so it is better to jointly appeal. The grain levy is a legacy of the imperial system, the so-called "heavenly grain tribute," which should be exempted with the imperial system. The former Jiangsu Provincial Assembly discussed and requested its abolition because it was related to the national tax, but it could not be done. Now, collecting grain in the city is even worse, which is not allowed by Party rule. Moreover, the military and other miscellaneous offices do not have grain levies. (2) The land tax in Jiangdu should be based on the three grades and nine levels. Whether the regulations for the land tax in the city have been approved by the Legislative Yuan and approved by the Executive Yuan. Moreover, the land in the city has superior and inferior, prosperous and remote areas. Whether they are the same grade is not fair. Even if it is said to be two and a half grades, the people's strength cannot bear it. Moreover, the new salt law will soon be implemented, and the market will decline in the future. There will be demolition but no construction, and it will be difficult to collect taxes. Therefore, it is not enough to reduce taxes to facilitate the implementation. (3) Jiangdu has always relied on the salt industry. Judging from the current situation, it will be difficult to stop the grain levy without exempting it. It should also be postponed, otherwise it will hinder the land reporting. Moreover, the tax rules must be determined after the establishment of autonomy and implemented simultaneously throughout the province. Now that autonomy has not yet been implemented and the counties are not uniform, it cannot be implemented immediately because of the opportunity to report the land of the taxable residences. Therefore, no matter whether the land reporting is done first, or the city land tax is held after the place is prosperous, it can avoid misunderstandings.</p>

They were escorted to Hangzhou. After being approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek through Yu Jishi, the director of the Zhejiang Security Office, the bandit leaders were transferred to the Nanchang Pacification Headquarters to be handled together with the Fang Zhimin bandit case. The Security Office specifically dispatched soldiers led by a specialist yesterday (23rd) to escort 35 bandit leaders, including Zhou Qun, the head of the pseudo-army group defense bureau, Tan Shiqing, the minister of the pseudo-army group health department, Hu Tiantao, the commander of the pseudo-21st division, Qiu Yucheng, the chief of staff, and Li Shubin, the political commissar of the pseudo-19th division, to Jiangxi by night train at 5:55.

<p>Suicide Due to Economic Pressure</p>
<p>On the night of the 21st, a male traveler arrived at the Weixing Hotel on Weixin Street in the northern city of Jiaxing. He was wearing a cotton robe and had a sad expression. He booked a room and claimed to be 31 years old, named Jiang Zhenting, a native of Songjiang, and a Jinghuo merchant. He went out once and returned to the hotel to sleep. Until the afternoon of the 22nd, he had not gotten up. The hotel staff pried open the door and entered, and saw that his expression was different. They questioned him, and he said he was sick. After being questioned again, he said he had swallowed opium. The hotel sent him to Dexin Hospital for treatment. However, the poison had already entered his internal organs, and although he was rescued, it was ineffective. He died in the evening. Only two small foreign coins and a few copper coins were found on his body, and a suicide note was found in his bedroom. The note said, "To the hotel, please forgive me. Recently, business has declined, and I have been unemployed for several months. Economic difficulties make it impossible to maintain my livelihood, so I commit suicide by taking poison. Please forgive me for everything. Jiang Zhenting from Songjiang, handwritten." Judging from his words, he committed suicide because he was economically pressured and unable to survive. The hotel has reported to the local branch of the court and sent someone to examine the body. After setting up a coffin, they are trying to find the relatives to claim the body.</p>

<p>Youth Commits Suicide Due to Unemployment</p>
<p>Sun Caixing, a native of Jiangcun in southern Yin, is 24 years old. Both of his parents are alive, and he has a younger brother and sister. He is engaged, but not yet married. Caixing worked as a partner in the Yuandong Shoe Store on Dongdu Road in Ningbo. Because the store's business was slow, the employees were laid off, and Caixing was dismissed. Caixing has been unemployed since then. Fearing being ridiculed by his neighbors if he returns to his hometown, he stayed with friends in Ningbo, thinking of finding a place to eat. However, in this time of commercial depression and overstaffing, he has been unable to find a suitable job for a month. His life has been miserable, and he has the idea of suicide. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, he booked room number 9 at the Mingzhou Hotel on Lingqiao Road and committed suicide by taking medicine. When the waiter discovered it, he had already died. A suicide note to his father, Sun Shunsheng, was found on the table, saying that the current situation is difficult and there is no interest in living, so he committed suicide.</p>

<h3 id="e84">China Labor Association Established Yesterday <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Tao Baichuan, Li Pingheng, etc., Elected as Directors</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Labor Association held its founding meeting at the auditorium of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in Meijialong at 1:00 PM yesterday. More than 300 representatives attended the meeting, passed the constitution, elected directors, and issued a declaration. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Those who attended yesterday included Tong Hangbai and Zhang Xiaotong from the Municipal Party Department, members Lu Jingshi, Tao Baichuan, Cheng Haifeng, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhao Shusheng, Ye Xianggao, Li Mengnan, Shui Xiangyun, Zhang Risheng, Dai Youheng, Lu Yunshu, Yu Yaoqiu, Liu Xinquan, all the students of the Workers' Training Department, the postal workers' Boy Scouts, and guests Zhu Shuren, etc., more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Lu Jingshi delivered the opening speech, saying, "Everyone, today is the day when the China Labor Association holds its founding meeting. The association has been initiated and prepared for three months. In these three months, we have legally completed the procedures and obtained the approval of the party and government agencies. Today, we are honored to have the party and government representatives give instructions and the guests enthusiastically participate, which shows great gratitude. The purpose of our establishment of this association is that the labor circles across the country believe that in the current environment, the production movement is needed, and it is necessary to engage in labor. If this is the case, the entire country will be able to be saved, and the labor circles themselves will have a way out. Therefore, the labor circles across the country believe that there must be such an organized organization. In the Soviet Union and Germany, they try their best to improve the ability of service and labor. Only those who can labor and serve loyally can have a happy life. This spirit is full of vigor. Today, the atmosphere of decay is permeated throughout the country. It is necessary to inject this vigor to arouse the people across the country to work hard. We are all engaged in the labor circles. In the future, we will formulate a work program and gradually realize it. This is the purpose and meaning of this association. This association will not only seek the welfare of the labor circles across the country and make the people across the country attach importance to the labor cause, but also seek to contact the world labor movement."</p>
<p>Preparation Process: After the chairman's report, Zhu Xuefan, a member of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparation process, saying, "The gentlemen who are enthusiastic about the labor movement and the labor circles first initiated the organization of the China Labor Association. However, because we feel that the mission of this association is great and the meaning is important, it is not something that a few people can shoulder. We have to seek it widely. In addition to continuing to recruit members in this city, we also seek membership from the gentlemen engaged in labor across the country. At the same time, we are legally handling the filing procedures with the party and government agencies. In the preparatory work, these two things are the most important. Now, in addition to Shanghai, there are also Beijing, Nanjing, Hankou, Luoyang, and other places participating in this association. After the establishment of this association, we not only hope that the labor circles across the country can practically seek the progress of the labor cause, but also hope that other circles can also give assistance from time to time, so that the association's affairs can be improved day by day."</p>
<p>Representatives' Instructions: Tong Hangbai, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave instructions, saying, "The establishment of the China Labor Association today is more important than the establishment of a certain trade union, because the Labor Association seeks the welfare of the entire labor circles, while a certain trade union is only limited to a certain part of the labor circles. The importance of the position of the labor circles in the entire nation is known to everyone. Moreover, since the serious national disasters suffered by our country since the 'September 18th' and 'January 28th' incidents have made the fate of the country in a state of extreme anxiety. Today, the people of the country all know that the country's fate is in danger, and they have come out to create the proposition of saving the country, but there are many propositions of saving the country, and I am afraid that it cannot be effective. Today, for the way of saving the country, there is nothing better than gathering the national power. In other words, it is to unite the strength of the entire nation and use it for the country. The labor circles are one of the most powerful parts of the entire nation. In the past, the labor circles were also affected by the atmosphere of decline. Today, we deeply hope that after the establishment of this association, it can be like a fierce bomb, thrown into the silent air, and in a bang, it can shake its silent air and turn it into an active air. Moreover, the importance of the position of the labor circles in the entire nation means that in the future, we not only hope that the labor circles themselves can be practically combined and show their great strength, but also promote other circles to get excited together and seek the liberation of the entire nation. On behalf of the Municipal Party Department, I hope that your association can fully exert its spirit and gradually complete the established plan." Subsequently, Cui Conghao, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech, saying, "I express my congratulations to the labor circles across the country for the establishment of your association. However, I still have a hope for your association. The responsible persons of your association should strictly prevent the moths of the labor circles from mixing in and practically protect the interests of the labor circles, and make the labor affairs proceed smoothly." Cheng Haifeng, the director of the China Branch of the International Labor Bureau, delivered a speech, saying, "On behalf of the International Labor Bureau, I express my great joy for the establishment of your association, and I am very happy for the future of the world labor movement. I am willing to cooperate sincerely in all future work of your association. I also see that the purpose of your association is perfect, and all those who participate in this association are practically engaged in the labor movement and are experienced, so I deeply congratulate the Chinese labor movement on its bright future."</p>
<p>Election of Directors: After the speeches, the constitution was passed and the election began. As a result of the election, the formal directors Tao Baichuan, Li Pingheng, Cheng Haifeng, Wu Huan, Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Maocheng, Zhao Shusheng, Wu Shaoshu, Yu Jiayong, Zhou Jiaxiang, Fu Dewei, Wang Yongsheng, Zhang Xiaotong, Zhang Jianbai, Shui Xiangyun, Chen Wenbin, Wen Zhuangyou, Zhang Daomin, etc., were elected. The alternate directors elected were Lu Yinshu, Han Dayong, Zhou Bingwen, Wang Yisheng, Guo Tian, Wang Jiashu, Li Mengnan, Ye Xianggao, Zhang Guangdai, etc.</p>
<p>Declaration of the General Assembly: China's labor movement has made rapid progress in recent years with the progress of the National Revolution. Not only are the second organization labor training, labor legislation, and labor welfare undertakings now roughly in scale, but also the general public's views and attitudes toward laborers and the labor movement have become more correct than before. I remember when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek began to advocate the New Life Movement, he put forward the slogan "Labor is the source of happiness" and established the method of "National Labor Service." Recently, in the letter to compatriots on the first anniversary of the New Movement, he further advocated "Life is productionized" and praised the greatness of labor. This is the gospel of the Chinese labor movement. These are the gains of the labor movement in recent years. However, if we look at the bright side, it is so. If we look at the dark side, there are indeed many shortcomings. First, although workers have organizations, the organizations are not all sound. Labor training is also not very successful. Second, although important labor laws and regulations are generally available, some parts are just lip service and do not reach the reality. Third, because of the rapid economic aggression of imperialism, the development of China's national industry has been affected, and the welfare undertakings of workers cannot be generally established. Fourth, although there are many urban workers with trade union organizations, there are no joint organizations between trade unions in one place and trade unions in other places, resulting in a lack of central strength, and scholars who study labor issues and social figures who sympathize with the labor movement, laborers, and labor groups do not realize that there is an organized connection, which somewhat affects the progress of the labor movement. Fifth, the labor movement has been advocated for more than ten years, but in addition to the general principles of the Three People's Principles, we do not have a detailed work program for the labor movement. These are all undeniable shortcomings in the labor movement. In order to remedy the defects and adapt to the needs of the facts, the China Labor Association was organized and established on February 24th, 24th year of the Republic of China. Based on the purpose of the establishment of this association, we have formulated a work program to be the goal of our future efforts. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Work Program: "Work Program of China Labor Association" This association is organized by various individuals or groups in the labor circles, as well as those who study labor issues or are engaged in the labor movement, to create labor theory and implement labor control. The work program is formulated as follows: (1) General Outline: Confirm the Three People's Principles as the highest principle of the Chinese labor movement. On the one hand, passively eliminate the ideology of class struggle, and on the other hand, actively promote the spirit of labor-management coordination, in order to strive for the construction of production undertakings and labor welfare, and seek the implementation of our party's labor policy. (2) In terms of education, advocate the dualism of "labor education" and "education labor", refer to the modern educational trend, and vigorously promote the universality of labor education, and promote national sports as much as possible, implement military training, and enhance the physical strength of self-defense. (3) In terms of production, we must rely on national interests, contribute ability and sacrifice freedom as a fashion, and take hard work and frugality as a creed. We must eliminate the bad habits of stealing, being passive, jealous, decadent, selfish, and opportunistic, and actively increase the nation's productivity. (4) In terms of welfare, we will work together to promote the undertaking of cooperation, labor insurance, labor nurseries, etc., in order to enrich the economic self-sufficiency of laborers. (5) In terms of organization, advocate taking courtesy, justice, integrity, and shame as the center, and diligence, thrift, neatness, cleanliness as the basis, and develop new life habits of being responsible, disciplined, believing in leaders, and obeying groups. (6) In terms of culture, advocate taking the Three People's Principles as the center, indicate the fallacy of communism and capitalism, eliminate cruel and hypocritical proletarian propaganda, and create a positive, scientific, and national labor culture. (7) In terms of relief, we will organize unemployment registration, job placement, and vocational guidance to relieve the panic of unemployment, and establish labor hospitals to solve the suffering of laborers. (8) In terms of legislation, we will adopt the modern legislative spirit of various countries, study the advantages and disadvantages of domestic labor codes, and suggest that the government improve labor legislation. The above is all the experience of our colleagues in researching and engaging in the labor movement in recent years. At the beginning of the establishment of this association, we would like to inform the people of the country and hope that we can encourage each other. China Labor Association, February 23rd.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Various Groups Meet to Discuss Relief, Market Recovery is Expected <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Three Banks Prepare to Launch Goods Mortgage Loans</p>
<p>Money and Banking Industries Release Loans as Much as Possible to Stabilize the Market</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai market has been depressed, after the local association, the municipal chamber of commerce, the money and banking industry association, and other national organizations held meetings for days to discuss the relief plan, and after the Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi expressed his best efforts to maintain it, the market has gradually stabilized and recovery is promising. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency learned from various parties yesterday that (1) the Central, China, and Transportation Banks have started preparing to launch goods mortgage loans. Once the amount of loans and detailed methods are determined, they can be implemented. The method will be modeled after the previous money and banking industry mortgage loans. However, the goods will be converted at the market price, and the daily dismantling market will be announced by the Central Bank every day. (2) The money and banking industries had previously resolved to tighten loans and restrict real estate mortgages, which had a great impact on the market. Real estate is one of the largest enterprises in Shanghai, and its prosperity and decline are closely related to the market. In view of this, the money and banking industries have expressed that in order to revive the market, they will appropriately increase the amount of real estate mortgages and handle the acceptance of various goods as usual. (3) Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the method of rewarding the import of foreign silver, major Chinese and foreign banks will have a large amount of cash transferred to Shanghai to regulate. At the same time, the Ping City Committee has purchased a large amount of cash from London, which will arrive in Shanghai in mid-next month. In the future, Shanghai's capital is expected to increase day by day, so the Shanghai market has gradually stabilized and recovery is promising.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Bank Circles Plan to Establish Public Warehouses <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The plan must be resolved and announced by the Financial Advisory Committee</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, major banks in the city, due to the recent economic downturn and reluctance from outside parties to accept warehouse receipt mortgages, convened a meeting at 4 PM yesterday at the Shanghai Bankers' Association Joint Preparatory Committee at 59 Hong Kong Road. The meeting aimed to increase the credibility of warehouse receipts and facilitate financial circulation in the market. The result was a general plan to establish public warehouses, which would issue warehouse receipts to facilitate mortgages. It is reported that this plan will be submitted to the Financial Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Finance for resolution before it can be announced and implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Estonia's National Day Celebrated Yesterday <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Estonian Residents Hold Celebration Ceremony</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the 27th anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Republic of Estonia. Although the number of Estonian residents in this port is not large, they are very united. They gathered at the Estonian Consulate last night to hold a celebration, chaired by Honorary Consul Lundborg, who has held this position since 1922. Estonia was ruled in turn by Germany, Denmark, and Sweden for seven hundred years, and for the last two hundred years, it was incorporated into Russian territory. Because of its position as a cultural and commercial intermediary between East and West, major powers often wanted to seize it for themselves. After losing their freedom, the Estonian people never forgot their ambition to restore their country. The outbreak of the European War provided an opportunity, and with the help of the British Navy and Finnish volunteers, they launched a righteous uprising against Russia and finally achieved their goal.</p>

<p>Notice from the Tunxi Anhui Provincial Government Administrative Office</p>
<p>The Post-War Affairs Office of the Anhui Provincial Government Chairman's Administrative Office in Tunxi issued a notice to tea merchants in Shanghai, stating that the Hong and green tea produced in the Anhui area is very large. Now that the Red Bandits in southern Anhui have been suppressed, teams have been sent to various counties to maintain law and order. It is known that the Tunxi-Huizhou, Hangzhou-Tunxi-Qimen, and other highways have been completed, and cars are running, making transportation very convenient. As the spring season approaches, tea merchants from various ports are urged to come to southern Anhui to conduct business as usual. The local government will absolutely be responsible for protecting them, and all kinds of exorbitant taxes will be prohibited to maintain commerce and alleviate financial difficulties. The bandit atmosphere in the Liuan area of western Anhui has long been cleared. Last year, tea merchants conducted business as usual. This year, the local order is even more peaceful.

<h3 id="e92">Professor Tan Yunshan of India's International University Returns to China <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Preparing to Organize the Sino-Indian Cultural Association</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Professor Tan Yunshan of India's Calcutta International University took leave from India on the 2nd of this month and returned to China. He arrived in Shanghai on the 21st aboard the Canadian Empress. The reporter met with Tan at his residence in Lida Academy in Jiangwan yesterday. According to him, in India, in addition to initiating the organization of the Sino-Indian Cultural Association, he also gave lectures on Chinese culture and Buddhism in various parts of the country, which aroused the sympathy and attention of Indian scholars. He also traveled to various Buddhist holy sites in India with Xu Weiguang, Commander of the Yunnan Gendarmerie and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and met with his old friend Mahatma Gandhi to discuss their long separation and the union of Chinese and Indian cultures, etc., which was very pleasant. The tasks of this return to China are: (1) To formally organize the Sino-Indian Society, because although the Sino-Indian Society was initiated by the Chinese side, it has not yet been formally organized. The Indian side has already been established, and the Chinese side should organize it as soon as possible. (2) To prepare to establish a Chinese Academy at the International University as a concrete foundation for the Sino-Indian Society to communicate the cultural undertakings of the two countries. Tagore is very hopeful about this and has personally written a concrete plan, which he handed to me (Tan refers to himself) to carry out. Tagore also has a personal letter to Dai Jitao and others in China to discuss this matter. I very much hope that this kind of organization can be realized as soon as possible, in order to conform to the Prime Minister's intention to unite the world's small and weak nations, to struggle together, to communicate Chinese and Indian cultures, and to promote Sino-Indian friendship.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the China Chemical Industry Society requesting an explanation as to whether the employee purchase discount manual should be stamped. The Chamber telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for clarification last month. The Chamber received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday. The original text is recorded below: The telegram and sample manual have been received. Since the employees of the China Chemical Industry Society purchase goods by paying cash according to the preferential price and are given a shipping invoice with payment and delivery at any time, the preferential manual issued is only for restricting the quantity of purchases and is not used to withdraw goods.

<h3 id="e103">Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Railways Again to Request Repayment of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Purchase Bond <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Purchase Bonds Cannot Be Compared to Old Debts of Distant Years</p>
<p>The Business and Transportation Conference Resolved to Repay Them First</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways yesterday, saying, "To the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, on the 22nd of this month, we received a letter from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Purchase Bond Holders Association stating that on the 12th of this month, we received your letter of the 11th, indicating that you had forwarded a telegram to the Ministry of Railways, ordering the Railway Bureau to take into account the agreement and not to extend it again. It also stated that you had received the Ministry of Railways' Geng telegram, which stated, "We have received the telegram, and regarding the case of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Purchase Bond holders requesting the return of principal and interest, the Ministry has repeatedly received petitions from the bondholders, which have been forwarded to the Railway for review and response. We have also telegraphed the Railway to promptly discuss and determine a plan and announce it to the bondholders for negotiation." We have listened to all of this and are very grateful. We have now received the Ministry of Railways' approval No. 49 on February 7, which stated, "We have received the report of January 22 of this year. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway has many debts, and the reorganization plan must be planned as a whole. The repeated postponement of the repayment of the principal of the purchase bond is based on the economic situation of the Railway. The various points mentioned in the report are mostly ignorant of the facts. In addition to ordering a prompt overall review and response for approval, this is the approval for notification." We were deeply surprised after receiving this. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau issued 1 million yuan of purchase bonds in 1928, and the regulations stated on the face of the bond that the locomotives and rolling stock purchased with this bond and the Railway's surplus profits would be used as collateral, and it was determined that from January 1931, the principal and interest would be paid off in ten months, except for April and September. According to what is stated on the face of the bond, there was originally no room for extension. However, the Railway Bureau first extended the period by two years due to the impact of the war on revenue. On February 4, 1933, the Railway clearly replied that the purchase bond tickets should be drawn for repayment of principal and supplementary payment of interest, and a plan had been drafted and submitted to the Ministry for instructions. Once approved, it would be announced, but there was no news of implementation afterwards. Until December 20 of the same year, the Railway issued a notice again, stating that it would be extended again for one year from 1934 for repayment. In summary, the Railway has treated its own credit as nothing, repeatedly breaking its promises, not understanding the suffering of merchants. The period of this extension has passed again, and there is still no clear repayment plan. After our detailed statement requesting immediate repayment, the Ministry did not plan for immediate repayment and accused us of being ignorant of the facts, and used the name of overall planning to delay the repayment period. It is not known that this bond has a specified guarantee and a limited repayment date, which is a specially ordered debt. How can it be mixed with other debts? It is very clear that it should not be planned as a whole. Moreover, the debt has been resolved by the National Business and Transportation Conference convened by the Ministry of Railways to give priority to repayment, and it goes without saying that it cannot be compared with other debts. We still ask for your righteousness to urge the Ministry of Railways to instruct the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to repay the debt on a specific date. The purchase bond is a new debt that has arisen in recent years. The amount is not huge, the agreed repayment period is short, and the locomotives and rolling stock purchased with the bond are used as collateral. It cannot be compared with old debts of distant years. The National Business and Transportation Conference also has a resolution to give priority to repayment. It seems that the old debt reorganization plan should not be applied, which would violate credit. According to the previous letter, we hereby telegram again to the Ministry for review and approval, and it is in the public interest to handle it as requested by the bondholders association. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows."</p>

<p>Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss Aviation Salvation Donation</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Recruitment Team Headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association began the second recruitment campaign, it has been actively carrying out recruitment matters, such as separately appointing leaders from all sectors, agencies, groups, and schools to serve as recruitment team leaders, carrying out activities to expand the recruitment of members, continuing to collect membership fees, and raising funds for aviation salvation. Letters have been sent to all groups in the city to join the Chinese Aviation Association as group members, and all banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, and other places in the city have been entrusted to raise funds for aviation salvation, in order to gather the strength of the people to assist the government in building air defense and developing civil aviation. It has been reported in various newspapers. It is reported that the headquarters also sent letters to the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and other organizations yesterday, requesting them to notify their members to strive for the aviation salvation movement, join the Chinese Aviation Association as members, and hold meetings regularly in the near future to promote and provide strong support, and to jointly achieve this great event. It is believed that the Municipal Education Association and other organizations have always been enthusiastic about aviation salvation, and their members will definitely participate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Clock and Watch Trade Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association's office on Nanjing Road at 2 PM yesterday. Dong Zixing and others attended. Zhang Yuliang, a representative from the Recruitment Team Headquarters, attended as a guest. The meeting discussed the issue of aviation salvation donations. Dong Zixing was immediately appointed as the team leader, and Shi Zongtang, Chen Baomeng, Zhuang Baoyong, He Youlan, Sun Meitang, He Zhaowen, Xu Chengzhao, Zhou Qingxiang, Wang Zhongzhen, Hu Qiaqin, Chen Duoming, Li Weizhai, Jin Shanbiao, Ren Kangbo, He Nanzhao, Bao Yiou, Hu Jinxiang, Wang Xinglong, Zhuang Honggao, Tian Zhaolin, Zhuang Zhihe, Cao Xiaoquan, Li Yangqiao, He Renqin, Shi Chongfu, Zhu Aoyuan, and Mao Wenrong were appointed as team members. In addition to each member determining the amount, they will start soliciting donations from outside immediately to achieve the predetermined goal.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei, the captain of the 301st Recruitment Team, found that the various recruitment documents previously issued by the headquarters were insufficient, so he personally went to the headquarters yesterday to collect 500 membership applications, 500 badges, and 10 copies of the Second Recruitment and Donation Campaign Overview. It can be seen that the captains are making efforts in the recruitment work.</p>

<p>But Five Points Must Be Noted</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's board of directors submitted a plan to the Ministry of Communications to borrow money from the Shanghai banking community to purchase ships to transport goods for the Longhai Intermodal Transport, and the Ministry of Communications instructed its approval. The original order said, "All submitted documents have been received. Purchase should be approved, and the funds can be borrowed from the Shanghai banking community by the Bureau. However, before the purchase, the following should be noted: (1) The ship's draft is 21 feet 9 inches. If it is fully loaded, it may not be able to enter the Haizhou Port, because the water in Lianyungang is only 18 feet when it is shallow. According to the report, the ship is used to transport wood and cotton, so the calculation is about 3,000 tons of cargo each time, and the draft can be reduced. However, it should be verified that if the ship carries about 3,000 tons of cargo and cannot freely enter and exit Lianyungang, the purchase should be stopped. (2) The appearance, hull condition, and internal equipment of the ship have not been stated. A simple drawing should be provided to clarify the situation and facilitate inspection. (3) Whether the boiler and smoke pipe or water pipe and other important components of the ship are in good condition should be checked before purchase. (4) The speed of the ship, according to the report, is 9 nautical miles per hour. It should be clarified whether it is the maximum speed or the ordinary speed. (5) The business estimate of the ship does not include depreciation, which should be added to the calculation of profit and loss. The above points should be followed."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Shenxin No. 5 Factory Declares Shutdown <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>More Than 2,000 Employees Lose Their Jobs</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Shenxin No. 5 Textile Factory (formerly Deda) at 1316 Huade Road was founded in 1914, with the Rongs as managers, Rong Weiren as the factory director, and Zeng Xiangxi as the chief engineer. The registered capital was 1.3 million taels, with 54,208 spindles and 12,720 thread spindles, and more than 2,131 employees.</p>
<p>Reasons for Shutdown　In recent years, the price of yarn has been cheap and the price of cotton has been expensive to the extreme. Under the leadership of the Rongs, the factory was fortunate not to fail. By the time of the Spring Festival, after the final settlement, the decline of the yarn industry reached its peak. Although the Rongs tried their best to plan, there was no solution, resulting in the official declaration of temporary shutdown on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>Aftermath Problems　Since the factory shut down, more than 2,000 workers have suddenly lost their support, resulting in the organization of a petition delegation to request relief from relevant Party and government departments. The workers deeply understand the Rongs' difficulties and are actually acting out of desperation. It is said that some workers are willing to reduce their wages, but due to factual difficulties, it has not been possible to fulfill their wishes so far. As for Rong himself, he is actively planning to start the factory again. According to relevant departments, the banking syndicate related to Shenxin should urgently seek a relief plan for this incident in order to maintain it, to maintain the livelihood of more than 2,000 people, and to support this basic national industry.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Inland Navigation Association Strives for Cooperation Rights on Inland Waterways <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Revised to Include Cooperative Clauses</p>
<p>Urging Fellow Businesses to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Dagong She reports that when the Ministry of Transportation held a meeting last year to promote the shipping industry, it instructed the former Shanghai Shipping Association to collaborate with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to establish a Shipping Cooperation Design Committee. A plan was drafted and preparations were underway. However, the Inland River Steamboat Association of this city, feeling that the plan excluded inland river businesses and was of great significance to the inland navigation industry itself, submitted a reasoned argument to fellow businesses. The original text stated: Since the Ministry of Transportation convened a national shipping conference in Beijing in March of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) to promote the shipping industry, the most important resolution was to promote effective cooperation in the national shipping industry. It was agreed upon to implement two methods, A and B. Method B stipulated that the Shanghai Shipping Association, following the Ministry's approval of the resolution, would join with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to form the China Shipping Cooperation Design Committee to plan specific cooperation schemes. On August 23rd, Mr. Chen Bogang, the Secretary-General of the former Shipping Association, sent a letter to the Chairman Zhang of this Association, suggesting that the issue of shipping cooperation had been privately decided by both parties. Inland river businesses should participate in the cooperation based on the principle of line division. On September 7th, this Association submitted a document to the China Shipping Cooperation Design Committee, clearly stating that inland river navigation should be based on the principle of line division and incorporated into the specific cooperation scheme. On September 13th, this Association received a letter from the committee stating that, after a supplementary discussion at the temporary committee on the 11th of this month, a special clause had been drafted and included in the scheme. However, the specific cooperation scheme for Chinese shipping, approved by the Ministry of Transportation on December 29th of the 23rd year of the Republic, instruction number 22149, only included clauses for harbor vessels and did not have a special clause for inland river vessels. This Association considered the matter of inland river cooperation to be of great importance and raised it for discussion at the 50th Executive Committee meeting. It was resolved to: (1) request the preparatory office of the China Shipping Cooperative to copy the original text and plan submitted to the Ministry of Transportation by the former Design Committee for reference; (2) formulate the principle of line division for inland river businesses and hold a joint meeting with inland river business associations to promote progress; (3) convene a temporary general meeting of members to jointly discuss cooperation methods. On February 3rd, this Association received a letter from the preparatory office of the China Shipping Cooperative stating that after the China Shipping Cooperation Design Committee approved this Association's request to include inland river lines in the scheme, it was passed at a meeting and a separate clause was drafted, added as Article 24 of the scheme, which stated: "Small boats operating on various inland river lines shall cooperate according to line, and profits and losses shall be calculated separately." It also added an explanation, submitted to the Ministry for inspection and approval. Later, an instruction and the scheme were received, indicating that there were still unsatisfactory points that needed correction, and specifically pointed out that Article 24 should be deleted and revised. After the meeting, the Ministry's instructions were followed for separate revisions and submitted for approval. Therefore, the scheme did not include clauses for inland river lines because it was handled according to the Ministry's instructions. This Association believes that the above-mentioned sections clearly show that the Ministry and the Cooperation Design Committee are depriving us of the right to cooperate on inland river lines. This Association considers this matter to be of great importance to the future safety and security of the inland river shipping industry, and should proceed with implementation in accordance with the resolutions of the 50th meeting. We hope that our fellow businesses will argue on reasonable grounds.</p>

<p>Instructing Personnel to Gather at Wuhu on the 25th to Lead Them into the Village</p>
<p>The Shiye She reports that since the completion of Qiaole Village, the number of unemployed returned overseas Chinese who have registered to go there has been very enthusiastic. Quite a few people have already been approved to enter the village for cultivation. The village originally had five residential buildings, a large auditorium, a warehouse, a public kitchen, and a cooperative, which are no longer sufficient. It has been decided to add six more residential buildings to accommodate them. The village has also sent Changwu Director and Affairs Section Officer Qian Bingkun to Wuhu to set up a reception center at the Huayang Hotel by the riverside to specifically receive overseas Chinese entering the village. According to reporters' investigation, the third batch of those approved to enter the village for cultivation includes Pan Hongguang, Chen Chonggeng, Chen Liangcong, Luo Qiming, Zhou Rihao, Chen Yangao, Wu Yinfa, Xia Yongchang, Ke Shixian, and other nine people. Yesterday, Approval Order No. 4 from the Nanjing Relief Committee for Unemployed Overseas Chinese was received, stating (details omitted): The returned overseas Chinese are allowed to arrive at the Huayang Hotel or Wan'an Hotel on Wan'an Street in Wuhu on February 25th, where they will be received by personnel from Qiaole Village and led to Shuiyang Town and then to Qiaole Village for cultivation. (Details omitted). The overseas Chinese and others, after receiving the approval order, are penniless and unable to travel, causing great anxiety.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, Dr. Jiang Kanghu gave the second lecture on the Ten Admonitions for a Good Life at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge. The lecture covered the third admonition, "Sleeping in the Open," and the fourth admonition, "Waking Up Early." Dr. Jiang specifically hired the Bingxun Shorthand Society of Kade Road Shanchang Lane to record the lecture. More than 500 people attended. The main points of the lecture are recorded below. Dr. Jiang said that Zeng Guofan often used the four characters "renting books, pigs, vegetables" to encourage his descendants. I also have the four characters "cloth, vegetables, dew, walking" to encourage myself. I have already discussed "wearing cloth" and "eating vegetables." "Dew" is "sleeping in the open," and "walking" is "walking." I absolutely practice the first two, and I relatively practice the latter two. I sleep in the open in warm and sunny weather in spring and autumn, and I walk when time and energy permit. "Sleeping in the open" does not mean without shelter, but rather fully obtaining sunlight and air. Westerners sleep with their windows wide open, which is very beneficial to health. The Chinese do the opposite, which should be improved. Next, he talked about getting up early. Dr. Jiang advocated sleeping for six hours. The concern is not lack of sleep, but rather sleeping without truly sleeping. Insomnia not only affects the body but also affects one's career. The best way to remedy insomnia is through intense work and more exercise. In this way, a tired body will surely get a sound sleep, and getting up early is especially necessary.</p>

<p>The Completion of Jinrong Pavilion Will Be Held at the Same Time</p>
<p>The people in the Caohejing Town area of ​​western Shanghai have suffered from wars since Jiazi (1924). Caohejing Town alone was spared from the devastation. During the Qingdang (Purge the Communist Party) campaign, Yang Xinzheng, the chief of the town's defense group, took strict precautions, and there was no disturbance. Therefore, the local people loved and respected him. They specifically initiated a torchlight procession for three days every year on February 27th and March 1st to celebrate and commemorate this event. It has now been eleven years. This year, we are fortunate to celebrate the victory of the frontline soldiers in suppressing bandits, sweeping away the lairs of bandits, and the frequent news of victory. The New Life Movement has been promoted for one week, and the revitalization of the nation is truly beginning. Therefore, the residents feel more excited and cheerful about the local commemoration. Another event worth commemorating in the area is the enthusiastic advocacy and generous donations of Huang Jinrong, a prominent figure in Shanghai, for the public welfare of the town, including building bridges and roads, defense, fire prevention, hospitals, and charity. The townspeople were all grateful for his virtue. Therefore, Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, and others donated the construction of the Jinrong Pavilion in the west of the town for the citizens to admire. Construction began last winter and has now been completed. It is now scheduled to hold an unveiling ceremony for the pavilion on the 27th and 28th of this month. A public banquet will be held for guests in the Huang Family Garden at noon, and a torchlight procession will be held in the evening. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

Next to the corpse were a pair of tattered cloth shoes, one silver dollar, twelve dimes, and sixty-eight copper coins. The corpse looked like a released prisoner from the Second Prison. It was determined that the cause of death was illness. No family members were found. It was ordered to take photos, and the corpse was handed over to the Baojia for burial.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Three Months of Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>Peng Shaoxiang, from Yancheng, Jiangbei, is 23 years old. He married Wang (approximately the same age as Peng), a woman from the same village, as his wife. They have been married for six years and have one son and one daughter each. Peng and his wife originally farmed in their hometown for a living. Recently, due to the bankruptcy of the rural areas in their hometown, they came to Shanghai together last year to make a living. They lived together in the back building of No. 6 Wufeng Lane, Kangdi Road, in the French Concession. After Peng arrived in Shanghai, he first made a living as a peddler, and then pulled a rickshaw. Recently, he was recruited as a patrolman in the French Concession Police Department. As a result, the family's life was slightly better than before, and they lived happily together. Jiang Deshe, also from the same village and an acquaintance of Peng, is 35 years old. He used to pull a rickshaw for a certain family for a living. He lived alone in the attic below Peng's house. He often joked with Peng's wife, Wang. Recently, he developed an affair with Wang. At about 5 AM on the 21st of this month, Jiang took advantage of Peng's absence from duty and sneaked into the room to carry out the cuckoo's nest plan, engaging in a secret rendezvous with Wang. They were in the midst of passion when Peng happened to forget his clothes and returned home to retrieve them. He suddenly saw his wife and Jiang naked, sleeping in the same bed. Peng was consumed by jealousy and immediately grabbed Jiang and reprimanded him. Jiang, in desperation, knelt on the ground and begged Peng to forgive him. At that moment, Peng was in a hurry to go to the police station for duty, so he did not pursue the matter and released Jiang. At about 10 AM that day, Peng returned home from his shift and saw Jiang still sitting on the bed with his wife, talking and laughing. Therefore, unable to vent his anger, he reported to the police station and sent Detective Jiang Shaotang to bring Jiang and Wang to the police station. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the Special Court No. 2. Fee Xizhen, the lawyer of the police station, stated the case and prosecuted them for the crime of disrupting the family according to Article 256 of the Criminal Code, requesting legal action. Then, the plaintiff described the previous situation. When Wang was interrogated, she confessed that when her husband went out for duty yesterday morning, she was sleeping in bed. Jiang Deshe suddenly broke into the room and raped her. At the time, she refused, but he claimed that her husband owed him 9 yuan and 40 cents, which had not been repaid. If she allowed him to have sexual intercourse, the debt would be waived. Therefore, she was temporarily deceived and defiled. Jiang Deshe confessed that he had been in a relationship with Wang since June of last year and had had intercourse three times. The rest of his words were evasive. After verification by Judge Qiu Huanying, the court sentenced Peng's wife, Wang, to continuous adultery, and Jiang Deshe to continuous adultery with a married woman, each sentenced to three months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Major Fire at Gonghexiang Warehouse <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Burning from Midnight Until 10:30 AM Before Being Extinguished</p>
<p>Valuable Goods All Reduced to Ashes, Fortunately No Injuries</p>
<p>——Losses of Goods Exceed 500,000 Yuan——</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a major fire occurred at Warehouse No. 26 of Gonghexiang Wharf on Huade Road. Valuable goods stored in the warehouse and goods deposited by the customs were all reduced to ashes. The losses were extremely heavy, exceeding 500,000 yuan. The fire started at around 3 AM yesterday morning. It was discovered by the warehouse keeper at 5:10 AM, by which time it had already broken through the roof. By the time the fire brigade arrived, the interior had been completely destroyed. It was not extinguished until 10:30 AM, truly a catastrophic event.</p>
<p>Warehouse Contents. The Gonghexiang Wharf on Huade Road is owned by Gonghexiang Wharf Co., Ltd. The land is very vast, with a total area of ​​several thousand meters. The land is represented by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd. and is insured against fire with Jardine Matheson. Entering the wharf through the main gate, Warehouse No. 26 is a magnificent building with three floors. On the 22nd of this month, the Norwegian ship Tokyo arrived in Shanghai and docked at the wharf. Workers were hired to unload the cargo. From the day before yesterday to yesterday, more than 2,000 pieces of coconut oil, more than 3,000 pieces of iron wire, and more than 1,500 pieces of sundries, foreign goods, and medicines were unloaded and stored on the ground floor of the warehouse. At that time, the second floor of the warehouse was filled with sundries, and the third floor was a customs warehouse, filled with miscellaneous foreign goods such as artificial silk, felt hats, and leather shoes deposited by the customs. These goods were all goods that had not paid customs duties and were deposited here by the customs. They could only be taken out after paying the taxes.</p>
<p>Fire Situation. The Norwegian ship had not finished unloading the day before yesterday and stopped that night, planning to resume unloading yesterday morning. However, at 5:10 AM yesterday morning, just as dawn was breaking, the warehouse keeper suddenly saw heavy smoke rising from the roof. He rushed to investigate and realized that the warehouse was on fire. He immediately sounded the alarm and called for help. At the same time, he reported to the police station by telephone. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, together with the nearby fire brigade, drove more than ten fire trucks to put out the fire. Unfortunately, most of the warehouse had already been destroyed by the fire. Because artificial silk, coconut oil, and other materials were extremely flammable, the fire continued to rage despite the firefighters' efforts. It was not until 10:30 AM yesterday morning that all the goods in the warehouse were burned, and the fire was extinguished. Warehouse No. 26 was reduced to an empty shell, with scorched tiles and ashes as far as the eye could see. The tragic scene was unbearable.</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident. According to investigations, the cause of the accident was that some of the coconut oil unloaded from the Norwegian ship on the ground floor was extremely flammable. At around 3 or 4 AM the night before last (yesterday morning), a burning object combined with the coconut oil on the ground floor (one theory is that it was unextinguished cigarette butts). The fire then spread, and in an instant, a small spark ignited a large area, and smoke and fire filled the air, rushing from the ground floor directly to the second and third floors and breaking through the roof. At that time, because coconut oil and artificial silk and other goods seized by the customs on the third floor were extremely flammable, the fire became uncontrollable once it started. There were five people guarding the warehouse, and they only became aware of the fire after it broke through the roof at 5:10 AM yesterday morning. Because the fire started in the northern part of the ground floor, no one was inside at first, and they were unaware of the fire. At 5:10 AM, the Central Fire Brigade dispatched a large number of fire trucks, more than ten in total, to rescue and extinguish the fire by spraying water from fire hoses. Unfortunately, the coconut oil on the ground floor was extremely flammable, and adding water on top of oil made it even more difficult to extinguish. On the contrary, it was not until 10:30 AM that the entire warehouse had been burned down and the fire was extinguished.</p>
<p>Police Investigation. The General Patrol Police Department dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, together with the fire brigade, to assist in the rescue and protection after the accident. An investigation was conducted into the losses suffered. Because no estimate had been made, the exact number was not yet available. However, all the goods stored in the warehouse were extremely valuable, and the quantity was very large. The losses were estimated to be more than 500,000 yuan. According to a spokesperson for Gonghexiang Wharf Co., Ltd., the construction of the warehouse and the goods inside were all insured by Jardine Matheson, so there should be no losses. The goods unloaded by the Norwegian ship were also insured and unaffected. However, the goods seized by the customs and stored on the third floor of the warehouse were feared to be uninsured. There were also hundreds of coffins deposited in the warehouse by other parties, which were also burned. Fortunately, the fire occurred late at night, and no one was on duty in the warehouse, so no one was killed, which was a great blessing in misfortune.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government and the Central Bank</p>
<p>Agree on Four Mutually Beneficial Measures</p>
<p>The Central Bank has long been planning and proceeding with the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf. In order to promote the early completion of the wharf, the Municipal Government invited representatives from the Central Bank, Secretary Ling, to exchange opinions and agreed on four mutually beneficial measures: (1) The Central Bank will pay for the construction of roads in the wharf area. (2) The Central Bank will build a public wharf with a shoreline of 50 meters in accordance with the city's plan. (3) The Central Bank must first seek the consent of the Municipal Government for the entire plan of the wharf warehouse and the steps for phased implementation. (4) If the Central Bank transfers the assets of the wharf warehouse, it must first obtain the consent of the Municipal Authority, and the city retains the right to repurchase at a preferential price. It is reported that the above-mentioned measures have been agreed upon by both parties.</p>

As for the openly solicited wedding certificate styles, there have also been many applicants. However, in order to achieve perfection, the Bureau is still deeply hoping that art experts from this city and other places will actively apply, so as to obtain a beautiful and innovative design. It is reported that in mid-March, the Bureau plans to announce the names of the approved married people and register them publicly.</p>

<p>In order to take care of the welfare of the general poor, the Municipal Government has specifically formulated a complete plan and submitted it to the Central Government for approval. The construction of housing for the poor will begin soon. In order to prepare thoroughly, the Municipal Government held a registration for the shanty towns in Qimei Road, Zhabei, and western Shanghai. The heads of each household were photographed and filed. Those who are literate were asked to sign the registration form, otherwise they were asked to imprint their fingerprints for verification. When the housing for the poor is successfully built in the future, the residents can be moved in separately according to the registration book. This detailed method is currently being negotiated and finalized by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>The Detective Who Went to Hong Kong to Escort Hua Zhongchu Will Be Sent Again</p>
<p>Yang Jianping, the former Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, was impeached by the Supervisory Yuan and reported by the court for corruption and embezzlement of public funds during his tenure. Not only did Yang not surrender and confess his crimes, but he fled to Fujian in the winter of the previous year to participate in the treasonous activities advocated by Chen Mingshu. When the Central Government pacified the Fujian Rebellion, Yang fled to Hong Kong to seek refuge with foreigners. Recently, after negotiations between the Central Government and the Hong Kong authorities for extradition, Yang was detained by Hong Kong officials. The Shanghai First Special District Court, which was handling Yang's case, learned that the case had not been able to proceed because Yang had been evading justice. Now that he has been captured, he should be extradited and brought to justice according to law to deter corruption. Therefore, a formal letter of extradition was prepared, and the Public Concession Police Department was requested to send Detective Cai Liu, who had previously gone to Hong Kong to escort Hua Zhongchu, to Hong Kong at 1 PM yesterday afternoon on a certain ship to carry out the extradition with his expertise. The round trip will take about a week. If the Hong Kong authorities do not object to the extradition, Yang will be able to be brought back to Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>

<p>Marriage Not Yet Approved by Family</p>
<p>Teachers Should Not Be Intimate with Female Students</p>
<p>——Sentenced to One Year, Suspended for Three Years——</p>
<p>Wang Xiaohuai, a native of Shaoxing, 23 years old, resided in the Xiaobanqiao area within the city of his hometown. His father ran a school with many male and female students. Among them was Zhu Muying, a neighbor girl, 16 years old, with beautiful features, who had been studying at the school for eight years. Last spring, Wang's father passed away, and Wang took over as a teacher. Seeing Zhu's beauty and intelligence, and knowing she was not yet betrothed, while Wang himself lacked a suitable spouse, he developed desires. He frequently made flirtatious advances, and they fell in love. In July, they had physical relations. Zhu's mother, Zhu Zhou, was unaware of this. Later, someone acted as a matchmaker, but she refused due to the age difference between Wang and her daughter, and his less affluent family situation. However, the daughter was deeply attached to Wang, vowing to stay with him until old age, but was unable to disobey her mother's wishes, finding herself in a dilemma. Wang had recently been hired as a teacher at a primary school in Jiaxing and entrusted the school to others before going to He to take up the position, hoping to escape the local area and avoid the mother's nagging, planning to discuss things further. Zhu secretly left home on the 17th of this month, went to Jiaxing, found Wang, and asked him to take leave at night. Together, they came to Shanghai and stayed at the residence of a friend surnamed Zhang at No. 3, Yuan Yi Fang, Yangshupu Road. They each sent a letter to Zhu Zhou in Shaoxing, asking to resolve the marriage issue quickly. After her daughter went missing, Zhu Zhou immediately sent people to inquire, learning that she had gone to Jiaxing to find Wang, and then went to Shanghai. She arrived the day before yesterday, learned the location of their residence, and reported it to the Yangshupu police station. The head detective dispatched Liu Changgen to secretly go to the address and arrest Wang, along with Zhu Muying, taking them to the police station for detention. The woman was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital, where doctors confirmed that her hymen had been ruptured for some time. The next morning, Wang was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, detailed the situation and filed a public prosecution for the crime of obstructing marriage under Article 257, Paragraph 1. Subsequently, Zhu Zhou claimed that the defendant should not have induced her daughter to elope. Muying stated that she was not abducted by the defendant but voluntarily wanted to marry him. When questioned, the defendant, with tears streaming down his face, claimed that he did not ask Zhu to come to Jiaxing, and she came to Shanghai to play. He said she refused to return home, but he could not afford to maintain everything in Shanghai, so he and she each wrote letters to her mother, asking her to send someone to discuss the matter. The court declared that as a teacher, his marriage should require her mother's approval, and he should not engage in such improper behavior. The defendant said it was his great mistake and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi, after beginning the debate, sentenced Wang Xiaohuai to one year of imprisonment, suspended for three years. Attorney Li abandoned the appeal, and Wang was released. The woman was taken back by her mother, Zhu Zhou.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Mother Sues Son for Theft <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>And Requests the Judge to Punish Severely</p>
<p>Result: Sentenced to Two Months of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Sun Xiangzi, a young man from Jiangbei, residing at No. 34, Dongxin Lane, Median Road, French Concession, is 22 years old this year. His original surname was He, and his given name was Yu Fu. Because his father died early, his mother remarried into the Sun family, and he changed his surname to Sun. After his mother married into the Sun family, she opened a brothel for a living. Xiangzi had already married and started a family. He used to work at the tram company, but because he did not seek advancement, he was dismissed by the company and became unemployed. He also liked to associate with hooligans. When he had no money to spend, he gradually stole household items such as clocks, candlesticks, bedding, and other miscellaneous items for pawn or sale. Because his mother's brothel was like an inn, she had many quilts, and over thirty of them were stolen. Recently, his mother, Sun Zhou, unable to bear it any longer, reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Sun Xiangzi, confiscating dozens of pawn tickets and recovering many stolen goods, all of which belonged to her. He was taken to the police station for detention. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed a lawsuit for theft under Article 337 of the Criminal Code. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Sun Zhou, testified that her unfilial son had stolen household bedding and pawned it for spending. She redeemed it, but it was stolen and pawned again countless times. Unable to bear it any longer, she reported it to the police and requested severe punishment. When questioned, Sun Xiangzi confessed that after he lost his job, he asked people to find him work, but he had no money for socializing. He asked his mother for money, but she refused, so he had no choice but to pawn the items for use. He claimed that taking his own belongings for pawn could not be considered theft. Now that his mother wanted to punish him, he could do nothing and requested severe punishment to please his mother. The plaintiff also stated that there were over a hundred pawn tickets for her son's stolen goods, but nearly a hundred had been destroyed, so not many stolen goods were recovered. She requested severe punishment to warn against unfilial behavior. After Judge Sun Peng examined the confessions and admonished the defendant, he immediately sentenced Sun Xiangzi to two months of imprisonment for continuous theft as a warning.</p>

<p>Chen Manzi, a native of Yangzhou, lives in the stove room at No. 1250, Siwen Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road. His wife, Wu, is his concubine and is 47 years old this year. At about 7 p.m. yesterday, three robbers dressed in blue cloth shirts and trousers suddenly broke into Wu's room, threatened her with guns, and forced her to take off the gold ring on her hand. Wu, upon seeing this, disregarded the danger and ran out, shouting for help in the alley. At that time, the robbers, seeing her escape, knew things were bad and also ran out. However, as she was shouting for help, residents gathered from all directions, and the robbers panicked. They pulled out their guns and fired two shots at her, hitting her head and shoulder, causing her to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. The robbers then seized the opportunity to escape. Nearby patrol officers arrived, but they had already disappeared without a trace. They immediately reported to the police station and sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. An investigation into the gang was launched. However, as she was seriously injured, her life was in danger.</p>

<p>The Yangjing District of Pudong has a large population, separated from Yangshupu by only a river. It has long been included in the urban area, and because of its low rent and convenient transportation to the bustling city, it is a gathering place for vendors. The area covers about twenty square li, with over 17,000 households and a population of over 70,000. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau's Pauper Loan Office, for the purpose of expansion, originally planned to establish another pauper loan office there. However, after investigation, it was found that local thugs were engaged in lending money at high interest rates, exploiting the poor. It is necessary to strictly crack down on this behavior, and the establishment of a loan office is even more urgent. Personnel have now been dispatched to liaise with the local party branch and public security sub-bureau, and it is expected to open soon.</p>

<p>The case of Lang Zuyin, a detective from the Old Zha police station, being sued for injuring Cai Yangqi has lasted nearly a year, and the trial has been held more than ten times. However, because Detective Lang has refused to appear in court, the case remains unresolved. It has recently been learned from a certain source that since our Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the relevant country's ambassador, ordering the Shanghai Municipal Council to immediately instruct the detective to surrender for the court to handle the case according to law, negotiations have made some progress. A relatively satisfactory resolution may be achieved soon. Yesterday (the 23rd) afternoon, the date for determining the documents was reached, but the police station only submitted the cause of action to the First Special District Court. Judge Liu Yugui approved the postponement of the hearing to the afternoon of April 18. It is reported that the lawyer representing Cai Yangqi's wife, Cai Fan, intends to change tactics if the negotiations are not resolved and Lang Zuyin still refuses to appear in court by the deadline. They will request a halt to the part of the lawsuit concerning Detective Lang's injury and first hear the part of the lawsuit accusing Bao Defu of defamation, gradually concluding the case to avoid prolonged delays.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Mr. Zheng Jinwen, Founder of the Datong Music Society, Passed Away Yesterday Morning <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Jinwen, Standing Committee Member and Director of Music Affairs of the Datong Music Society, was the founder of the society. He was gentle, humble, and amiable. He was exceptionally intelligent from a young age. At the age of twelve, he was proficient in silk and bamboo instruments. Later, he learned major musical pieces such as the pipa and zither. In his spare time, he explored musical classics and music theory, especially focusing on elegant ancient music. Mr. Zheng's achievements today were not accidental. In the past, he lamented the decline of Chinese music, believing that such a large ancient country was being criticized for having no music. He was deeply concerned and worried about this. Therefore, in 1925, he, along with Mr. Wang Tiyu, Wang Yuting, and Mr. Shi Liangcai, General Manager of Shen Bao, advocated the establishment of a music society to revitalize it. The plan was completed in less than a month, and Mr. Zheng was elected as the president. He strongly advocated using Datong as the society's name, believing that it was based on ancient and modern times, thoroughly researched, and created valuable music to meet the music of the world. This was Mr. Zheng's ambition. Later, he repeatedly led members to attend cultural gatherings and international gatherings to perform, which was highly praised by Chinese and foreign figures. The society was famous at home and abroad, and people from the party, government, and society gradually paid attention to it. In his spare time, Mr. Zheng also edited music books, among which "A History of Chinese Music" was the most brilliant. In 1930, the society was reformed, and a committee system was adopted. Mr. Li Shizeng, Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Gongquan, Zhang Yuejun, Feng Youwei, and other gentlemen sponsored and served as standing committee members, which accelerated the society's progress. Mr. Zheng was still not satisfied and strived for development, such as supervising craftsmen to imitate more than 160 kinds of ancient musical instruments, forming a large orchestra, composing large musical pieces, and so on. He spared no effort in training future generations. People in society hoped that he would achieve something, so that Chinese music could be placed in a bright position. However, heaven did not bless him, and the art star suddenly fell. Mr. Zheng suffered a stroke on the morning of the 23rd of this month. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he died of illness at 1 a.m. on the 24th, at the age of 64. The news of his death shocked the art world. Mr. Zheng had many students. Now, an organizing committee will be formed to assist in funeral affairs, and a request will be submitted to the committee to form a memorial service preparation committee to plan memorial activities to express sorrow.</p>

<p>Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou police station, learned that someone was selling narcotics, red pills, for profit at No. 31, Jiugeng Lane, Haining Road. At about 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, he, along with Chinese and foreign detectives, secretly went to the address to arrest them. The main culprit had fled upon hearing the news. A group of people, including a Ningbo woman, Gu He, a Ningbo man, Li Arong, and a suspect, Feng Guilong, were arrested. Seventy-four packages of red pills, totaling 1,054 pills, along with smoking paraphernalia, were confiscated and taken to the police station for separate detention. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated the situation and requested investigation. Subsequently, Detective Shao reported the process of solving the case and presented the evidence for inspection. After Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated the defendants, Gu He was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, Li Arong to three months, and Feng Guilong was acquitted and released. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Fellow Merchants in the Straw Hat Export Business Organize a Association <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Fellow merchants in the straw hat export business in this city operate businesses producing straw hats in the Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Taizhou regions, selling them overseas. Because there was no corresponding organization in the past, disputes and dishonored bills often occurred. It has recently been heard that over thirty businesses, such as Wang Xiangji, Huifeng, Shenyi, Wuzhou, Tongchun, Jufeng, Dalai, Shentai, and Zhang Junji, have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Straw Hat Export Business Association. The Shanghai Municipal Party Department has approved and registered the association, and issued Permit No. 399. Since receiving the permit, the association has begun preparations, electing Wang Jiuxiang, Zhang Shanhe, Feng Mingsheng, Shu Lincai, Zhan Baoqi, Xu Zhishang, Zhang Wenhuan, Shen Minli, and Lin Jinfu as preparation members responsible for the process. The temporary office is located at No. 5, Lane 1, Dean Lane. The association's declaration is recorded below: We, the straw hat export businesses from the Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Taizhou regions, specialize in exporting straw hats, selling them overseas, reaching tens of millions of dollars annually. However, due to the lack of corresponding connections and the organization of a association, everyone acts on their own, often leading to disputes, even manipulating the market, disrupting market prices, inciting female workers, and dishonoring bills. All of this can lead to bankruptcy for fellow merchants, let alone conducting foreign trade. Our country's famous silk and tea export industries have existed for over two thousand years, and their history is unparalleled by other industries. However, due to merchants adhering to old methods and the shortsightedness of seeking immediate gains, they have been seized and replaced by neighboring countries. Moreover, our industry's history is still young, and it is likely to follow in the footsteps of the silk and tea industries. In today's world of increasingly fierce commercial warfare, the survival of the fittest is the natural law. Looking at various European and American countries, their organizational steps for business are extremely strict, either monopolizing the market or aggressively dumping goods, competing openly and advancing steadily. The collapse of rural areas and the decline of industry and commerce in recent years have been long-standing issues, not accidental. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of an industry is extremely important for the livelihood of female workers and farmers. We, who are engaged in this industry, understand this deeply. In the face of the current crisis, how can we remain silent? Therefore, we have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Straw Hat Export Business Association, hoping to unite businesses and customers, dispel mutual barriers, strive for excellence in product technology, promote market expansion, and work together to save the situation. We hope that enthusiastic fellow merchants will actively join. The bright future depends on this. May our fellow merchants strive for this. We hereby announce our sincere intentions and hope you will understand. We hereby declare.</p>

<p>The Eighth District Branch of the Second Special District Municipal Association Resolves to Assist</p>
<p>The Yongmao Coal Yard at No. 94, Rue Coubert, French Concession, has been setting up coal depots on three vacant lots at No. 106 on the same street and Nos. 782 and 793, Rue de la Luta, for several years. They have always been at peace with each other. Recently, the Jiu Yi Real Estate Company, adjacent to the two depots at No. 106, Rue Coubert, and No. 793, Rue de la Luta, suddenly claimed that the two depots were damaging the company's properties, forcing Yongmao Coal Yard to move the two depots, otherwise, they would have to compensate for the loss of rent. Mr. Xu Shunbao, the owner of the yard, argued that the two depots had built high fences and stacked coal baskets near the bamboo fences before storing coal, so there was no risk of dampness or damage to Jiu Yi's properties. He politely refused, and the matter was shelved. Unexpectedly, on the 16th of this month, the French police suddenly sent Western police officers to the yard, ordering them to move all three depots within eight days and imposing a fine of fifteen foreign dollars. Yongmao Coal Yard is a member of the Eighth District Branch of the Second Special District Municipal Association. They reported the information and requested assistance from the Eighth District Branch. The branch held an emergency meeting at noon yesterday. Nine executive committee members, including Qian Kan, Cao Xianda, Wu Guowei, Zhang Zhiqin, Pan Dafu, and Ding Weisheng, were present. Wu Guowei was elected as the chairman, Zhou Guantian as the secretary, and the meeting was conducted according to regulations. First, Executive Committee Member Xu Shunbao reported the situation of being forced to move by Jiu Yi Real Estate Company and the French police.

<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the province to investigate and register pawnshops established in accordance with regulations, as many have not provided guarantees and have been privately established. Moreover, pawnshops have very little capital, and if there are cases of fraud, it will have a significant impact on the livelihoods of farmers. It is necessary to investigate separately for assessment, etc. The county government yesterday instructed the district chiefs to quickly investigate all registered and unregistered pawnshops in their jurisdictions, listing their names, addresses, and the names of the owners, and submit them for verification and transfer.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Fire Dispute Lawsuit Concluded <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Heshun Woodware Shop, opened by Zhang Zhongxiang at No. 761, Nine Mu, in this city, suddenly caught fire at about 6 a.m. on December 17 of the previous year. Afterwards, Zhang pointed out that the stove in Xie Xing Restaurant, opened by Chen Guoyou at No. 763 next door, was close to the wall and burned through the wall due to the strong fire, spreading to the wall cabinets of his shop, causing the fire. Because both shops had fire insurance, they shifted responsibility to each other. Chen Guoyou claimed that the fire started from Zhang's shop and caused damage to his property, so he filed a lawsuit with the local court. The Criminal Court was instructed to summon and interrogate the plaintiff. Zhang Zhongxiang hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to defend him. Yesterday, the verdict was announced, Zhang Zhongxiang was found not guilty, and Chen Guoyou's attached civil lawsuit was dismissed.</p>

<p>Bai Lao Si Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Bai Lao Si, a native of Anhui, 43 years old this year, has been engaged in selling vegetables. He lived with his wife, Zhou (30 years old this year, a native of Nanjing), and their eight-year-old son at No. 94, Route Mercier, French Concession. On January 9 of this year, at 3 a.m., Bai, as usual, went out to buy vegetables. When he returned home at 5 a.m. to sort them, he discovered that Li Zhijia, an acquaintance from his hometown (47 years old, residing at No. 6, Lane 128, Route de la Luta, guarding a self-flowing well at No. 159, Lane 1, Route Haig), was having intercourse with his wife, Zhou, in bed. Bai, consumed by jealousy, immediately used the bamboo pole used to carry vegetables to beat his wife and Li in bed. Unexpectedly, Zhou and Li resisted. In a panic, Bai used the sharp-edged knife used to sell vegetables to stab Li in the lower abdomen and Zhou in the arm. They shouted for help, and the sub-landlord heard the noise and reported it to the police. Detective Xu Jinlong rushed to the scene and arrested Bai, along with the murder weapon, and took them to the police station for detention. The next day, the police sent Bai to the Second Special Court, charging him with attempted murder and detaining him pending further investigation after the injured parties recovered. This has been previously reported. Later, Li and Bai Zhou recovered from their injuries and were discharged from the hospital. Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court held a continued hearing. The police changed the indictment, charging Bai with the crime of assault under the Criminal Code. The interrogation has been completed. The day before yesterday, Judge Zhang presided over the First Criminal Court, ordered the defendant to be brought to court, and acquitted Bai Lao Si. During the appeal period, the defendant was detained in the detention center awaiting instructions.</p>

<p>Shanghai National Goods Company Spring Clearance Sale – The Shanghai National Goods Company, located across from the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, is preparing to implement scientific management and has established a clearance department on the second floor of the company since the day before yesterday to clear inventory from all departments. New goods for each department have been completely replenished. It is specifically scheduled to hold a spring clearance sale starting today. The most new goods brought in by the company this time are in the silk and satin department, which sells products from 125 factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. All kinds of patterns are complete. During the spring clearance sale, they will all be sold at cost to protect the silk industry's inventory. The one-corner goods sold by the clearance department, such as one box of Pushi soap powder, two bars of Aihua soap, one pair of children's leather shoes, one bar of Aihua sandalwood soap, and one pair of men's and women's yarn socks, are selling very well. Other items, such as three-compartment enamel handbags, are only sold for five corners each, and stewed bamboo shoots are only sold for one corner and a half per can, which is an unprecedented bargain.</p>
<p>Grand Sale at Huahua Company – The Huahua Silk and Satin Company on Sanma Road, Shilu, has seen prosperous business and crowded customers since its grand opening sale the day before yesterday.

Therefore, the customers who went to the store yesterday morning were like a flowing river of horses and cars and were unusually crowded. Before 9:00 AM, the store could no longer accommodate them, so the iron gate had to be pulled up, causing those who came later to feel regret. They stood at the door of the store waiting for it to open, which caused more and more people to gather. The roads on both sides were crowded with people. In addition to the sidewalks being full, there were also many people in the center of the road. However, I heard that there were so many customers that some could not buy the cheap goods and were inevitably disappointed. It is reported that the store is planning other common methods and will choose a date to hold another event to seek compensation.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Style and Genius <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>Although what is presented here are two old terms, there is no intention of exploring their true meaning from their elusive word meanings. Style and genius obviously each represent one aspect of Chinese literature, and they seem to be opposed to each other in any setting. These two can be broadly used to represent two schools in Chinese literature. After style and genius clearly became school names and resisted each other, a third school of Shenyun (神韵, divine rhyme) appeared, but that was just a popular compromise that was ultimately completely ignored, so Shenyun is not a term that can be a match for the former two. On the other hand, as the literal meaning of Shenyun suggests, Shen (神, divine) is an expansion of genius, and Yun (韵, rhyme) is a reduction of style. As a result, it did not receive sympathy from the genius school, and the style school similarly despised it, and its compromise and reconciliation were not very successful.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of people advocated the literature of the late Ming Dynasty. There is no doubt that they want to stand on the side of the genius school. But they recognized that the opponent standing on the opposite side was the Fangjinqi (方巾气, square cap spirit) and Daoxuepai (道学派, school of morality), then they seem to not be very clear about their own sect. The literature of the late Ming Dynasty cannot be directly opposed to Daoxue, but it stands in the circle of thought of the late Ming Dynasty and consciously breaks out of the circle of thought of the Song Dynasty. The Chan crown of the late Ming Dynasty thought worn by the literature of the late Ming Dynasty is actually more conspicuous than the square cap of the Song Dynasty Daoxue worn by Song literature. If we do not distinguish between literature in a broad sense and literature in a narrow sense, the texts of the Song people defending Daoxue are indeed larger in quantity. But those literatures should be listed as pure philosophy and not included in literature. If we only take pure literature such as prose and poetry of the Song Dynasty to compare with the prose and poetry of the late Ming Dynasty, then the authors in the literature of the late Ming Dynasty can't forget to express their thoughts (expressing their aspirations) everywhere, while all in the Song literature is just a kind of atmosphere cultivated through Daoxue, and rarely directly gives reasoning in pure literature.</p>
<p>If we use words such as "zhi zhong he" (致中和, achieving balance) and "fa er jie zhong jie" (发而皆中节, issuing and all are moderate) to explain that kind of atmosphere, then it is obvious that what is created in literature should be style. And it is natural for the style school to cite Song Dynasty literature. There is no problem that a literature contains philosophical thoughts. The only question is how harmonious the degree of integration is. Style can be said to be a sign of the degree of integration. This is also the basic difference between the style school and the genius school. The genius school does not talk about integration but requires nakedness.</p>
<p>The so-called nakedness is the meaning of nakedly expressing their genius or expressing their aspirations that they advocate. But whether aspiration is innate and needs to be expressed nakedly is indeed a question. I am afraid that being able to reach that state still depends on cultivation. What is human nature at all? This question really can't get any answers. Becoming a saint and absolute saint is actually equally difficult. The models of Confucius, Mencius, Lao Tzu, and Zhuangzi are equally difficult to imitate. However, the outline of the model of Confucius and Mencius is more accurate, while the model of Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi varies greatly under various lights. It is easy to recognize whether something compared to the correct outline is similar or not. On the contrary, it is okay to say whether it is similar or not. The followers of Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi can forget their own depravity and blame the followers of Confucius and Mencius for depravity, so it is also natural.</p>
<p>But here, let's not involve pure ideological issues yet. On the one hand, wearing a square cap that advocates the doctrine of the mean and promotes the methods of being human, and on the other hand, being an expressionist school in literature, the relationship between them can be reluctantly separated, but in other respects, the style school can also be regarded as the same as the Fangjinqi. I know what genius and style are, and they are not worth talking about now, but since some people are re-evaluating genius, at least style should be taken care of.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Random Talks on Historical Anecdotes (4) <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Su Dongpo said: "Articles are everywhere, only a skillful hand can pick them up." When first reading history books, those major events and major figures attract our attention. If we follow this path, we will have to write dull textbook-style historical texts. After reading for a long time, lovely events and lovely figures flash out here and there. The great figures, heroes, and sages in our eyes are still living people made of skin and bones, flesh and blood, just like us, with emotions, reason, a bright side, and a dark side. We put aside the front and enter from the side, put aside the big things and enter from the small things, and our writing will be very active. The story of mankind written by the great modern American historian Vna Leon (Vna　Lcon), I was stunned to read when I first saw it. When he wrote about the French Revolution, I put down the book and wondered how he would write about Napoleon because others used hundreds of thousands of words to write about Napoleon and still felt it was not enough. How could he cover it with thousands of words? When I turned it over, he wrote:</p>
<p>"I am now sitting in front of a very comfortable table, the table is full of books, one of my eyes is looking at my typewriter, one eye is looking at my cat, and I am telling you that Emperor Napoleon is not worthy of being human. But if I look up slightly and see countless cars and horses suddenly stop on the street outside the window, and a burst of drums in my ears, and the short and capable Napoleon comes riding on a white horse wearing a worn blue military uniform, then I will not be able to control myself. I am afraid I will also throw away my books, abandon my cat, leave my home, abandon everything, and run after him, and he can lead me wherever he wants. My grandfather followed him like this, and God knows that he was not born a hero. And thousands of other people's ancestors also followed him like this. They did not get any rewards, nor did they hope to get any rewards. They were willing to sacrifice their limbs and lives to be driven by him, leaving their hometowns and traveling thousands of miles to the fortresses of Russia, England, Spain, Italy, or Austria, calmly watching the continuous artillery fire and death battle... (The Story of Mankind, Volume 2, page 172)</p>
<p>The way he wrote it, although it was a branch and a section, was enough to set off the center of gravity of the event and the soul of the figure, and all of them were used as themes. Then, for "one twenty-four histories", are we still afraid of finishing writing it? Often read the Historical Records and the Book of Han, and see Sima Qian and Ban Gu record the affairs of Emperor Gaozu of Han, with many extravagant and exaggerated places. But from the lines, such as:</p>
<p>(1) Mother Ao should rest by the Great Lake, and dreamed of encountering a god; at that time, there was thunder and lightning and darkness, and his father Taigong went to see it, and saw Jiaolong on it, and soon became pregnant, and then gave birth to Emperor Gaozu.</p>
<p>(2) Emperor Gaozu was a person who loved wine and sex, and often drank and lay drunk from Wang Ao and Wu Fu Huangjiu, and Wu Fu Wang Ao saw that there was always a monster on it. Emperor Gaozu bought wine every time and stayed to drink, and the enemy doubled. When he saw the monster, at the end of the year, these two families often folded their debts and abandoned their responsibilities.</p>
<p>(3) Lu Gong was good at judging people, and saw the appearance of Emperor Gaozu, so he respected him and invited him to sit in the seat. After the wine was over, Lu Gong said: I have been good at judging people since I was young; I have judged many people, but none is as good as Ji, I hope Ji will cherish himself!</p>
<p>(4) Empress Lu lived in Huizhong with her two sons, and an old father passed by and said to the queen: Madam is a noble person in the world... Emperor Gaozu chased him and asked the old father, and the old father said: The appearance of the king is so noble that it cannot be said. ... When Emperor Gaozu was rich, he did not know where the old father was.</p>
<p>(5) Emperor Gaozu was drunk and walked through the Ze in the middle of the night, ordering one person to walk in front; the one who walked in front threw back and said: There is a big snake in front of the path, I wish to return. Emperor Gaozu drunk said: What is the fear of a strong man! Then he drew his sword and cut the snake. ... Later people came to run to where the snake was, and there was an old woman crying at night,... My son said that the emperor is also a son, and now the son of the Red Emperor cuts the son,... The woman suddenly disappeared. ... Emperor Gaozu was happy and proud.</p>
<p>(6) Emperor Gaozu was hidden in the Mangyu Mountain Ze, and Empress Lu and others often found it. Emperor Gaozu asked strangely, and Empress Lu said: Where Ji lives, there is often a cloud of gas above. ... Emperor Gaozu was also happy.</p>
<p>Those sections all have traces of the Liu and Lu families colluding to create rumors, as long as they are interspersed, they can be written into an interesting sketch. Also, such as Xijing Zaji, remember:</p>
<p>"The Supreme Emperor moved to Chang'an, living in a deep palace, sad and unhappy. Emperor Gaozu secretly asked the left and right about the reason, because his favorite in his life were all butcher young people, buying wine, selling cakes, fighting chickens, and playing Cuju, and he missed this; now there is nothing like this, so he is unhappy. Emperor Gaozu then made Xinfeng and moved all the old friends to it; the Supreme Emperor was pleased. Therefore, Xinfeng has many ruffians and no children of clothing and hats, so it is also. When Emperor Gaozu was young, he often sacrificed to the Fen Yu Society; when he moved to Xinfeng, he also re-established it. Emperor Gaozu had built Xinfeng and moved the old community lanes, buildings, and objects to the old state; the men and women, old and young, carried their heads on the road, and each knew their room, released dogs, sheep, chickens and ducks on the main road, and also competed to know their homes. The craftsman Hu Kuanying also managed it." It is also an excellent theme.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Little White Mountain <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>Crossing the Wender River and heading south along the Songhua River, the road is no longer a flat road but a country road. Dust is flying on the road, and the five grains are standing in the fields waving to you, as if to say:</p>
<p>"City people, what are you doing in the countryside?"</p>
<p>The weeping willows along the way have long recognized the people who come to play, and they understand:</p>
<p>"These people are here to go sightseeing at Xiaobaishan."</p>
<p>The road is gradually moving away from the river, which means it is gradually approaching the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>Xiaobaishan is not big, probably because of this, it got the nickname "Little" on Baishan? It is an isolated mountain, with no mountain ranges connected to it. Even so, the mountain itself still has two small mountain peaks. It is not too high either. Looking at it from Jilin City from afar, it looks like a pile of earth.</p>
<p>Here, there is not a bit of the meaning of the city. You will see the boundless fields of green wheat, clumps of forest bushes, and when you see the crooked farmhouse thatched cottages and the simple and loyal farmers, you almost think that this is a place of quiet, and it will immediately arouse your aversion to the city and the city people.</p>
<p>The mountains are forested with tall oak trees, short mountain old red trees, and tender willows. The forest is like putting a velvet coat on the mountain. As for the grass and miscellaneous flowers, they are the patterns on the velvet coat.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the mountain pass, there is a deer circle, and people who come here must stop. The wooden circle is badly damaged and has been in disrepair for many years. People play with the deer for a while, and then go up the mountain along the narrow winding path.</p>
<p>There is a temple on Xishanfeng Mountain, a desolate mountain ancient temple, which has always been mutually used in famous places in China, and no one can do without the other. It seems that the name of the mountain is due to the temple, and the temple must be built in a famous mountain to be considered enough face.</p>
<p>There is a hall in the temple, and a large plaque is hung horizontally under the antique eaves. The hall is very wide, and there are no walls on the east and west sides, and the walls are mostly open. On the gable walls hang plaques written by generals and other figures from the Qianqing period, all of which are exaggerated words of beautiful scenery. If you take the words in the plaque too seriously and lose yourself, you will definitely be disappointed in the scenery in front of you. Honestly, Xiaobaishan doesn't have any scenery, but people want to go around, and I don't know what the reason is.</p>
<p>However, when you leave the open hall of the temple and climb to the east mountain peak, you will not feel very happy. Looking south, what first comes into your eyes is a white belt, like a white snake, but when it winds to the east side of the mountain, it is the lovely Songhua River. Then, you will feel admiration for the distant mountains; they present several colors in front of you, and for that kind of erratic smoke, you will think of the story of the "mirage". Then you look at Jilin City in the northeast. The city is surrounded by mountains, setting off a depression in the middle. To say it madly, the surrounding mountains are like the side of a small boat, and Jilin City is just a pile of rotten goods in the boat. Yes, the houses in Jilin are all old and dilapidated. But when your eyes turn to Baibailong, the mood that your eyes receive is different. There, brand-new high-rise buildings, red brick and bluestone, there are three or four of them, standing tall in the green fields, ferocious. This is the Jilin University campus. Left attached, the station building of the Baibailong Terminal on Ji-Hai Road is also a noteworthy building, which is three-dimensional, and it seems that some people have said that it is German style. The railway extends from the front of the station, one towards the southwest and one towards the northeast. This was originally a village on the edge of the city, but now it has become lively.</p>
<p>Listening to the birds chirping on Xiaobaishan is an interesting thing. As long as you can calm down, you can hear many different kinds of bird languages, and you can also see many different shapes and feathers. If you are not a hunter and do not carry a shotgun, they will also land in front of you and chat with you, telling each other's short and long stories.</p>

<p>— Chen Yumen</p>
<p>Heavy footsteps hesitantly stepped onto the stone steps, peeking through the door crack to see if the dog was out. Dark, thick fingers touched the door and gently knocked, a hoarse voice uttering a trembling sound.</p>
<p>The child hid behind, sniffling, breathing warm air into their sleeve, knowing there was a doorbell in the center of the door, but knocking on the door was enough to cause a moment of fear.</p>
<p>A sorrowful and kind expression was put on the face, eyes fixed on the two door panels, hoping to visit several more houses in a day, meeting charitable people who cared for the old and pitied the poor.</p>
<p>Perhaps a cane could ward off enemies, knocking on the door could relieve the hunger that twisted the intestines, but the sharp wind laughed at the holes in the tattered clothes, and the closed door seemed to carry a cold arrogance.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Letter (Part 1) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Xingwen</p>
<p>Although spring has not yet arrived, the sound of rain is already a bit weary. Spring rain falls slowly. The sound of raindrops outside the window corresponds to the beating of the heart in my chest. Gently pressing the letter against my chest, the up and down movement of blood in my heart is felt by my hand through this letter. If the soul is in the heart, it must now be happily flying into this letter. I smile slightly, smiling at this poor and lovely soul, smiling at its happiness.</p>
<p>The electric light illuminates the entire room in the evening. The light appears particularly gentle, with a milky white hue. The light shines on my smiling face, and the light also knows that I am happy. The sound of rain falls drop by drop, seemingly knowing some secrets in my letter. I feel like I want to immediately buy an image of Guanyin Bodhisattva to hang up. I am willing to burn the purest and finest ambergris in front of her image and worship. It must be the inspiration of Guanyin Bodhisattva that brought me this letter, which is filled with the aura of immortals and the flavor of Buddha. The words seem to have been soaked in the fragrant dew of plum blossoms before being taken out.</p>
<p>I thank Guanyin Bodhisattva for her greatness, she has given me this kind of comfort. I feel as if I am lying in a cradle made of soft swan feathers, sleeping freely and without worry in the spring air and sunlight, filled with a faint scent of wine and pink hues. When I wake up, there are songs like light pearls and floating jade flying all around, the songs flying and often brushing against my face.</p>
<p>From today onwards, I feel the preciousness of life, and I begin to feel a warm willingness towards my rosy future. I begin to see swallows and orioles fluttering in the "bright future" ahead. It seems as if there are lazy flowing waters, and white gulls and snow egrets are gently floating on the water. I tell God that I am willing, a hundred million times willing, to abide by the words in the letter. I will definitely fulfill my career as she hopes, and I believe I have the ability and opportunity. I feel like I am paddling hard on the calm, green spring water. I have already seen the village under the green trees ahead, that corner of the red building, the embroidered windows, and the person I have dreamed of waiting by the window.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Towards Evening (6) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Room number thirteen of the Dahan Company has a hundred-candlepower electric light, shining brightly and illuminating all the furnishings in the room.</p>
<p>The room is horizontally long. The windows face the Dahan Company's balcony. A long sofa is placed by the window. At the entrance, two sofa chairs flank a tea table with a thick glass top. A clean heated bed is靠inside: Outside the heated bed, there is a round doorway with a dragon pattern, with a white gauze curtain hanging low outside the doorway, half-opened. Separated from this heated bed by a slat wall is the bathroom. Outside the bathroom, there is also a copper bed lying horizontally, also covered neatly with a white gauze curtain; the red silk quilt, somewhat sexually stimulating, is folded靠inside the bed. A printed white blanket emits a white light, as if secretly mocking the despicable behavior of people.</p>
<p>The walls of the room are pure white, and under the illumination of the electric light, the entire room overflows with snow. The wind outside the window blows in with the smell of coal smoke, but in this white light, it adds a sense of coolness to people. At this time, the owner of the room, Hu Yiyuan, is lying on the heated bed, writing his "successful article."</p>
<p>In the middle of the heated bed is a mahogany plate. In the center of the plate is a ghostly-fire-like opium lamp. Next to the opium lamp are some silver boxes filled with opium paste. Hu Yiyuan, lying on his left side, is holding a pipe in his right hand and an opium needle in his left hand, packing the opium. A big man with a potbelly is lying on his right side.</p>
<p>The light from the opium lamp is flickering as if in a panic. Like a snake's tongue, it often stretches out from the round hole at the bottom of the cover, licking and cauterizing the opium paste on the pipe. Hu Yiyuan is also very clever in playing with this snake-tongue-like light. When the snake's tongue really wraps around the opium paste and emits a burst of flames, he immediately uses his thumb and forefinger to pinch the opium paste, extinguishing the flames; and pinches the opium paste into a small, round ball. At the same time, a bone-penetrating fragrance emanates from between his fingers, causing his throat to reflexively swallow a mouthful of saliva. He burns and pinches it like this three or four times until he finally uses the opium needle to make a small hole in the opium head, and a pipe of opium is packed. Hu Yiyuan begins to suck on it, making "chi ge chi ge" sounds.</p>

<p>A Decisive Victory Over Russia by Twelve to One</p>
<p>Will Hold the Finals with Portugal</p>
<p>In the Western Union Football Club's International Cup football match, China and Russia held their semifinals in Shenyuan yesterday afternoon. China eliminated Russia with a huge score of twelve to one and won the right to the finals, which will be held with Portugal at a later date. With the thriving image of Portugal this season, the Sino-Portuguese finals will be very interesting to watch. Yesterday's game was completely one-sided. The Shaguer team represented Russia in the game, and the difference in strength was so great that China had complete control. More than 4,000 spectators burst out laughing. Li Yichen scored eight goals alone, but the Chinese team's performance was not yet at its best.</p>
<p>China Painstakingly Scores Four Goals in a Row</p>
<p>China kicked off and immediately took the offensive. About seven minutes into the game, Wanxiang Hua crossed from the side, Luo Haiguang jumped up and headed the ball. The Russian goalkeeper got the ball but lost it again. Li Yichen rushed up and kicked the ball into the net. Although the five Russian forwards tried their best to counterattack, the Jiang and Li defenders were heavily guarded and ultimately could not enter. Once, Li Yichen received a ball in the penalty area and was about to shoot forcefully when the Russian left inside defender panicked and mistakenly committed a handball, resulting in a penalty kick. Li Yichen scored with one shot. Then, Jia Youliang dribbled straight in, kicked the ball with great force at a suitable position. But the goalkeeper dived to catch the ball. Jia and Li charged forward to dribble the ball and the man, and when they sent it into the net, Sun Jinshun dribbled deep. The Russian goalkeeper ran out to block, Sun immediately passed to Li Yichen, who was able to calmly score into the empty net, leading by four goals.</p>
<p>The Russian Team Bravely Recaptures a Goal</p>
<p>The Russian defenders, ashamed of their previous dereliction of duty, blamed themselves and fought back with extra effort. Ten minutes before the end of the first half, the Russian center forward went straight in alone and shot a ball from outside the penalty area, hitting the target and making it four to one. After that, they fought back and forth several times, desperately fighting. In the chaos, the first half ended, with the Chinese team leading by four to one.</p>
<p>China's Victory Makes Up a Dozen</p>
<p>Less than two minutes after the break, Wanxiang Hua got the ball and picked it up. Li Yichen made no mistake. At this point, the Russian team was already at the end of its rope. It could not counterattack and found it difficult to defend. The Chinese team's defensive skills were particularly outstanding. Li Yichen was especially brave and scored two more goals in a row, making the score seven to one. Before long, Luo Haiguang scored with the help of Yichen, and Li Yichen then scored again (eight to one). The Chinese team became more and more courageous and their offensive power never wavered. In the last five minutes, Sun Jinshun scored twice, and Luo Haiguang got a penalty kick and scored again, making it a dozen. Before the center kick-off, time ran out, and the Chinese team won with an overwhelming score of twelve to one.</p>

<p>The Result is Six to Three</p>
<p>In the Western Union Football First Division, the Donghua and Youyou teams did not play yesterday and the day before because of the Chinese team's semifinal match against Russia in the International Cup. Fa Shang won Ingus four to one, the results of which were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, there were also two games at the racecourse. Lux won a big victory with six to three. In the past one or two months, Lux has won every game and its military appearance is very strong. In the previous week, the Scota Cup met with Donghua in Shenyuan and after two hours of intense fighting, the game ended in a 2-2 draw. In the replay, Donghua could not deal with the full force and played cautiously. You Tai defeated the old and weak West Shang with six to zero. The scores of the teams in the first division are as follows:</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Will Decide in Mid-March</p>
<p>—The Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education Will Be Re-elected—</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 24th) The Sixth National Games will be held this year on Double Ten Day (October 10th) at the newly built stadium in Jiangwan, Shanghai. The Shanghai Education Bureau believes that although there are still seven months to go, preparations must be made early to avoid being rushed. It has specifically submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for instructions on how to prepare and to send personnel to preside over the preparations. After receiving the submission, the Ministry of Education will convene a meeting of the Sports Committee in mid-March to discuss the matter. In addition, because the term of office of the Sports Committee, which was established after the Fifth National Games in 1933, is one year, it has expired and one-third of the members should be re-elected according to the regulations. When the meeting is held next month, the re-election will be decided, and the list will be submitted to the Minister of Education for approval.</p>

<p>The Shanghai International Track and Field Games, organized by the National Sports Association, were originally scheduled to be held in mid-October last year. However, after a meeting of representatives from various countries, it was decided to postpone the games to the spring of this year due to various reasons. It is now learned that the authorities of the Sports Association are planning to hold the games in mid-May and will convene a meeting of overseas Chinese groups in Shanghai in the near future.</p>

<p>In the women's B game between Liangliang and Jiangjiang, the two sides are classmates and friends, so it can be said that they are like sister flowers. However, for the sake of sports and competition, they took to the stage to compete against each other for their respective teams. How different is this from siblings fighting each other? However, the younger sister was ultimately not as strong as the older sister. The score led all the way, and Jiangjiang, despite repeated efforts, was ultimately beyond reach. Liangliang won with a score of 33 to 16.</p>

<p>The Competition Schedule Will Be Decided in Shanghai in the Coming Days</p>
<p>The Venue Will Still Be Divided Between Shanghai and Nanjing</p>
<p>The Jiangda Sports Association will successively hold basketball, volleyball, track and field, and other competitions starting next month. The association had originally planned to convene a meeting in Shanghai recently, but because there were no particularly important matters, it has switched to using communication methods to discuss everything. A reporter from the Daily News learned the following from the person in charge of the association:</p>
<p>The Meeting Was Suspended and Discussion Was Conducted Through Communication</p>
<p>According to the discussion, the Jiangda Sports Association had originally planned to convene a meeting in Shanghai recently to discuss the various championship competitions that should be held this semester. Now, in addition to sending letters to the various organizing committees to prepare, there is no need to convene a meeting, so it has switched to using communication methods to discuss everything. A few days ago, it sent a letter from Shanghai to Mr. Xu Shaowu, a member of the association in Beijing, and Mr. Wu Demao Duan Naxun to discuss track and field matters, because these three are responsible for preparing the Jiangda track and field competitions. In addition, regarding the eligibility of athletes, whether students who graduate in three and a half years can participate, please also discuss with Mr. Wu Yunrui. According to the latest regulations of the Ministry of Education, universities should graduate in four years, and those who can graduate in three and a half years are no longer applicable today, so this case should not be discussed.</p>
<p>Basketball Competition is Actively Underway</p>
<p>As for the various championship competitions that should be held this semester, there are three items: basketball, volleyball, and track and field. The association has previously decided that the basketball competition will be held in March, the volleyball competition will be held in April, and the track and field competition will be held in May, all of which must be completed within that month. Currently, the Jiangda basketball competition is actively underway and is scheduled to begin in early or mid-March. The competition schedule will be decided in Shanghai in the coming days. The competition venue will still be divided between Shanghai and Nanjing as usual. At that time, the basketball teams of Fudan and Guanghua will first go to Beijing to compete against Jinling and Zhongda, and then Jinda and Zhongda will come to Shanghai to compete with Jinan and Chizhi.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Ministry of Education Orders on Improvement Points for Vocational Education in Hubei <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the Hubei Education Department, instructing them to follow the improvement points for vocational education in Hubei Province as detailed in the previous inspection report by Inspector Gu Zhaolin. It is understood that vocational schools in Hubei Province, after being urged and reorganized by the Education Department, have generally shown gradual progress. However, regarding the establishment of departments, the department should comprehensively plan based on the province's industrial and social needs, and stipulate the distribution areas and the number of departments to be established in schools to ensure that supply and demand are aligned. In terms of equipment, many schools throughout the province are still poorly equipped. The existing equipment of various engineering vocational schools should be enriched as soon as possible, and newly established provincial and district agricultural vocational schools should pay more attention to completeness. Furthermore, connections should be made with vocational circles to provide students with more internship opportunities. Regarding curriculum, the teaching material outlines promulgated by the ministry should be followed, striving for practicality, correcting the accumulation of empty talk and raising standards. Vocational guidance should be earnestly implemented to prevent students from misidentifying goals and changing careers or pursuing further education midway. In addition, private vocational schools in Hubei Province have not been developed. The Education Department should provide awards and assistance within its capabilities to promote progress. The points that need to be improved are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The implementation plan for reorganizing Hubei provincial secondary schools proposed by the Education Department is generally suitable. However, there is considerable duplication in the departments established in the current vocational schools. The Education Department should comprehensively plan and allocate appropriately, preventing schools from creating their own trends and hindering unified design.</p>
<p>(2) The current vocational education situation in Hubei Province, except for agriculture, where provincial schools are being planned and district schools are being established separately, is mostly focused on engineering. Among them, only one or two schools have a basic level of equipment, and there are many places where supplements are needed. A phased method for supplementing equipment should be stipulated according to the actual situation of each school, based on the lowest standard, to gradually improve.</p>
<p>(3) Engineering vocational schools must strive to enrich their factory settings and actively promote their connections with vocational circles. For example, according to the relevant responsible personnel of the Jiang'an Machine and Engineering Plants under the Pinghan Railway, "No vocational school students have ever come to the factory for internships, and vocational schools in Hunan and Hubei provinces have not contacted the factory. Occasionally, vocational school graduates seek work, but they are generally difficult to approve due to their poor experience. However, students' knowledge is far superior to that of workers. If mechanical engineering graduates are willing to come to the factory as interns without being restricted to specific positions, then they will be easier to promote and have better prospects than workers after they have achieved some results in their internships. Currently, newly graduated vocational school students seeking work either demand high salaries or are unwilling to work hard, which makes the factory dare not ask. This is not without reason." It seems that school personnel pay little attention to the matter of graduates interning at factories. Indeed, such matters of connecting with vocational circles are inherently cumbersome and difficult to implement in the mainland, and may be beyond the ability of one or two schools to manage. It is best for schools to jointly handle them and request assistance from the provincial government, education department, and construction department at any time. (4) The printing and copperplate departments of provincial vocational schools have a good foundation of equipment and have achieved effective results. Missing or lacking parts should be supplemented as soon as possible to achieve completeness. The applied chemistry department has some confidence in the tung oil industry and pigment experiments, so it should increase its research component and establish a small-scale factory for practical training to specialize and refine skills. It can also establish contact with Zhijiang Vocational School in Hunan Province, which has the same subject, for reference. (5) The original mechanical engineering and dyeing and weaving departments of the Third Provincial Secondary School have good factory equipment, but they are all old equipment from many years ago, and there have been few additions recently. The content of the factory and various machines lack organization. Attention should be paid to it and the teacher should guide the students. Practical training should also take into account technical issues to ensure students have expertise and specialization. The applied chemistry department should also narrow its scope to avoid being too broad. Since papermaking is said to be more certain and factory equipment funds are secured, a thorough investigation should be conducted on all aspects before setting up a factory for trial operation.</p>
<p>(6) Since the Second Provincial Secondary School merged into one school, the school affairs have been reorganized and are organized, but students have too few opportunities for practical training outside of classroom lectures, and training is also lacking. The school's proposed plan to establish a bank should be carried out as soon as possible. Labor training for students should also be implemented to ensure students are proficient in technology and can endure hardship.</p>
<p>(7) The dyeing and weaving department of the Provincial Girls' Vocational School has good equipment but still requires some necessary supplements, which can be added in phases. The home economics and embroidery departments should establish cooperatives, imitating the common practice of Hunan women's vocational schools, to benefit students' practical training and enhance their vocational awareness. Teachers should also create new designs and pay attention to the composition of goods in students' practical works, instead of just imitating popular products on the market to avoid a loss of creative meaning. Patterns, diagrams, flower designs, and sample chapters should be collected and organized into volumes for reference in learning.</p>
<p>(8) The municipal vocational school is composed of three schools divided into three locations, which are far apart, making management very inconvenient. Before the new school buildings are built, a setting plan should be determined and the subjects to be established should be planned properly. New students should be suspended and classes reduced to ensure the establishment of vocational subjects with perfect equipment, practical training, teaching, and training so that some achievements can be made. The current curriculum in each class should not strive for deep and advanced content. Textbooks must be suitable for students' levels. For example, using university textbooks for bookkeeping in senior commercial subjects is called improvement, but it has no practical benefit. More internship opportunities should be provided for senior commercial students to avoid being too broad and to correct the previous fallacy of preparing solely for further education. Although the original commercial subjects are based on the viewpoint of the Wuhan commercial market and there is a need to continue operating, the Second Provincial Secondary School has also set up a commercial subject, which is a dual-track system. Most of its graduates are also employed in Wuhan, Yangxia, and Hanyang. It is questionable whether the commercial market can accommodate three or four classes of graduates each year. Therefore, the establishment of the school's subjects should be planned in consultation with the provincial schools in a comprehensive way to be appropriate. Among the two branch schools, the girls' department is better organized, but students' vocational awareness is still not clear and must be corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Surveying Confucius' Tomb and Temple for Repairs <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the repair of Confucius' tomb and temple, the Executive Yuan ordered personnel from the Ministry of Interior (Chief of Section Tang Wencong) and the Ministry of Education (Chief of Section Zhong Lingxiu) to meet, together with experts in ancient architecture such as Liang Sicheng, to go to Shandong to inspect and estimate costs. Tang, Zhong, Liang, and Mo (Mo Zongjiang is Liang's assistant) arrived in Jinan on the 16th and 17th respectively. As it was Sunday, they began on the 18th to meet with engineers and surveyors from the provincial government's Civil Affairs, Education, and Construction Departments, eight people in total (12 total), to go to Qufu to survey Confucius' tomb and temple. The Confucius Temple covers dozens of acres and has a majestic appearance. After the officials inspected the temple, such as the Dacheng Hall, which is eighty or ninety feet high, scaffolding was erected to inspect the upper layer. The roof leaks and needs major engineering. The surrounding walls and column bases also need to be repaired. The Wenkui Hall (the name of the hall is unknown, whether it is Kui Xing Hall or Da Kui Hall, the reporter did not ask clearly and did not record it) is ten feet high. All parts of the roof also need to be repaired. In addition, Yan Zeng Meng and the Yansheng Gong Mansion have been inspected. Comparatively speaking, the Confucius Temple project is larger. Confucius' tomb covers dozens of miles. Except for the tombs of Confucius, Zisi, etc., which are concentrated in one place, the tombs of Confucius' descendants surround it on all sides, numbering in the millions. Ancient trees line the way, and pine and cypress forests are everywhere (pine, cypress, and juniper trees are the most numerous). It is heard that in recent years, a Mr. Zhang from Anhui donated more than 30,000 yuan to repair Confucius' tomb, so Confucius' tomb has been slightly reorganized and is inferior to the Confucius Temple. The officials stayed in Lu for five or six days. Engineering expert Liang Sicheng made a plan and instructed his assistant Mo Zongjiang to work with the technicians from the provincial government to conduct a detailed survey. Liang returned to Peiping because of matters in Peiping, and then joined another commissioner to work with Mr. Mo and others to carry out surveying and design work. The two chiefs of section, Tang and Zhong, returned to Beijing on the 23rd. Liang, an engineering expert, plans to draw detailed charts and tables based on the results of the inspection and survey, and to create a description of the types of materials needed for the project and all plans. In about two weeks, the representatives of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education will meet with relevant personnel from Shandong Province to discuss the estimate of the project and the construction method. After the representatives of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education have a concrete plan for their second visit to Shandong, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education will submit the estimated engineering expenses to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Central Research Institute of Zoology and Botany to Investigate Coastal Fish Production <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>To Proceed in Four Phases, Scheduled to be Completed in Four Years</p>
<p>First Phase of Work Determined to Depart in Mid-April</p>
<p>The Central Research Institute of Zoology and Botany, in view of the large output of fish in our country, in order to understand the situation of coastal fish production, has organized a Chinese Coastal Fish Production Investigation Group, which is scheduled to depart in mid-April. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Initiation The Central Research Institute of Zoology and Botany, recently, in view of the large output of fish production in our country, and the nature, types, producing areas, fish feed, etc., have not been studied in detail. Also, because our country's fishing industry is declining, in order to promote revitalization and understand the situation of coastal fish production, last year, Wu Xianwen was sent to Yantai, Shandong, for investigation. At that time, due to the short time, the results obtained were very small. Therefore, it has now been decided to organize a Chinese Coastal Fish Production Investigation Group to conduct large-scale searches and, incidentally, to test seawater properties, temperature, etc., as a reference for the development of fish production.</p>
<p>Work Plan The work plan is divided into four phases, each lasting one year, and is expected to be completed in four years. The first phase of the work will be from Qinhuangdao, Hebei, to Chengshanjiao, Shandong. The second phase of the work will be from Chengshanjiao to the Yangtze River Estuary. The third phase of the work will be from the Yangtze River Estuary to Shantou. The fourth phase of the work will be from Shantou to Guangdong Bay. Currently, the first phase of the work plan has divided the section into three areas, each with twelve fishing stations to facilitate investigation.</p>
<p>Organizational Overview The organization of the group is headed by Wu Xianwen, a researcher at the institute. In addition, there are two assistant members, several testers, and several fishermen. In addition, there is a fisherman leader. It has been agreed with the Navy Department that a warship will be allocated for use at that time. In addition to conducting fishery surveys, the first phase of the work will also focus on testing plankton.</p>
<p>Scheduled Departure The first phase of the investigation is scheduled to depart in mid-April. The budget for the expenses is more than 40,000 yuan. In addition to the 10,000 yuan extracted from the institute's annual expenses, the remaining insufficient amount will be submitted to the government for subsidy. The original four-year work plan may be shortened to two years if difficulties are encountered in terms of funding.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Overview of Health Education in the Wuxi Huibei Experimental Zone <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xieli</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute established the Huibei People's Education Experimental Zone in the Fifth Autonomous Region of Wuxi County in order to provide students with practical training in popular education. Since its establishment, it has been more than two years, and it has achieved considerable results in various aspects of people's education. The business area has also gradually expanded. There are now six branch areas in the entire area, all equipped with offices, and a total of 29 staff members. The area under its jurisdiction is 91 square li, with 106 villages, 5,381 households, and a population of 32,405, of which agriculture is the most popular occupation, accounting for 61%. This is the general situation in this area.</p>
<p>Health education is one of the key experimental items in this area. This article will only focus on the current situation of this education business, and describe it in detail:</p>
<p>(1) Disease Treatment</p>
<p>A simple pharmacy is set up in each area, storing more than 20 kinds of common medicines. Intern students serve as doctors and train students in public schools to use the pharmacy. The registration fee is two copper coins, and follow-up visits are free of charge. Medicines are charged at cost. The number of patients seen, based on statistics from May 1st to the end of October of this year, a total of five months, was 1,578 males and 2,382 females. The types of diseases were mostly skin diseases, accounting for 48% of the total, malaria accounting for 28.16%, eye diseases accounting for 19.34%, and other diseases accounting for 4.5%.</p>
<p>(2) Vaccination of Smallpox</p>
<p>This year, 695 people have been vaccinated against smallpox in this area, and it is still in the process of being vaccinated. The methods are: (1) using public school weekly meetings, tea garden talks, family visits and wall newspaper propaganda to publicize the importance of vaccination, (2) holding registration, (3) starting vaccination, charging three copper coins per person.</p>
<p>(3) Public health</p>
<p>(1) Eliminating open-air latrines——The methods are (1) propaganda, (2) talking with local leaders, (3) investigation, (4) individual persuasion, (5) joint implementation with the public. In October of this year, a total of 56 open-air latrines were eliminated in Chenjiaqiao in this area.</p>
<p>(2) Setting up trash cans——First discover the need for setting up, and then assist the township office in handling it. In mid-September of this year, a total of 26 trash cans were set up in Hengjie Township in this area. The accumulated garbage is collected by farmers and used as fertilizer.</p>
<p>(4) National Martial Arts Group</p>
<p>The area invites boxers to perform in various places, sparking the public's interest in national martial arts. At the same time, enrollment advertisements are posted and registration is held, and then training begins. There are now two national martial arts groups with a total of 88 members.</p>
<p>(5) Sports Field</p>
<p>The area uses wasteland to open up four sports fields, each equipped with simple sports equipment, totaling four horizontal bars, two parallel bars, one slide, and one stone shoulder. In addition, there are two football fields, one basketball court, and one sand pit. The expenses are borne by the local area, and local people are jointly responsible for guidance and management. There are now organizations and training of various ball teams, and a public sports meeting will be held regularly. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e184">Thoughts After Visiting the Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Laboratory <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Hengbi</p>
<p>Yesterday, the director of the Hygiene Laboratory of the Hygiene Bureau, Mr. Cheng Muyi, invited me to visit the laboratory. I was delighted to go. After entering the door, Mr. Cheng led me to visit for a week. Most of the equipment is domestic products, which are cheap and applicable. The important subjects are: bacteriology diagnosis, serum diagnosis, parasitology diagnosis, pathological diagnosis, chemical testing, and pregnancy reactions. In addition, there are various vaccines, such as cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis, dysentery, cowpox, and rabies. They are all available, and the disinfection is especially complete! At this point, Mr. Cheng showed me the fee schedule for various chemical tests and the price list of products, and I was even more amazed at how low the prices were. As for its internal administration, it achieves extremely complete facilities with extremely economical means, so that there is no leakage of money and no waste of anything. Therefore, I have a deep feeling! The chemical test is as inseparable as the left and right hands in diagnosis, and it is as dependent as the auxiliary car is on the cart. Therefore, large hospitals in foreign countries are equipped with extremely complete chemical test facilities. My country's medicine has not yet reached a developed stage, so hospitals and clinics established by Chinese people generally do not have fully equipped chemical test rooms. Therefore, the matter of chemical testing has to be sought in hospitals established by foreigners, which is really shameful. Now that the Hygiene Bureau has this large-scale laboratory, its equipment is no less than that of imported ones, and the price is several times lower. If all the doctors in our city can work together to recover the interests, then this great opportunity, why must we fill the greed of foreigners with useful money? Furthermore, the scarcity of our chemical test institutions is due to the lack of chemical test personnel. I deeply hope that the institute will pay attention to this and strive to cultivate chemical test personnel, so as to conform to the purpose of saving money for the country, which is not only the blessing of our medical community, but also the gospel of society.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Annoying Whooping Cough (Part 2) <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>(2) Spasmodic Stage. Mostly without fever. If fever occurs, it is often accompanied by complications. This stage has a unique spasmodic paroxysmal cough. Each paroxysm consists of fifteen to twenty continuous coughs, short and painful. After all the inhaled air is coughed out, a sudden deep breath is taken, accompanied by a crowing sound. The "Whoop" is just this one inhalation, and then the continuous paroxysmal cough starts again. This happens several times, and the child's face suddenly turns purple. If children with this disease are together, one child's cough often triggers the others to cough in response. However, after the cough stops, the child still plays normally, as if without any suffering. In severe cases of paroxysmal cough, the jugular veins are distended, and the eyeballs bulge out. Nasal discharge and tears flow, the conjunctiva is congested, and the eyelids and face become swollen. In very severe cases, hemiplegia may occur. Towards the end of a paroxysm, vomiting of food often occurs. In severe cases, blood may be coughed up from the nose. Involuntary urination and defecation are commonly seen. This type of cough is more severe at night. Children have difficulty ingesting food, leading to nutritional deficiencies and emaciation. Small gray ulcers appear on the frenulum of the tongue. The frequency of paroxysms varies; in mild cases, it occurs about five or six times a day, while in severe cases, it occurs about every half hour. If it occurs repeatedly more than a hundred times a day, it is often fatal.</p>
<p>(3) Recovery Stage. The disease gradually subsides. The frequency of paroxysms gradually decreases. There may still be symptoms of bronchitis during this period.</p>
<p>Complications... Other diseases often complicate the course of whooping cough. Bronchopneumonia is a common and often fatal complication, accounting for perhaps two-thirds of the mortality rate. Spasms are also common during the course of the illness.</p>
<p>Treatment Methods... (1) During a whooping cough epidemic, special attention should be paid to prevent children from being infected. If a child in a family has the disease, strict isolation should be implemented to prevent transmission. It is even better to move healthy children to an area where the disease is not present. (2) Taking the patient to the seaside is a suitable convalescent area. Going to the countryside in summer is highly recommended. In general, it is most important to have little dust, plenty of trees, and fresh air. Patients with severe symptoms should rest quietly in a large bedroom. Patients with mild symptoms and a fever below 37.5 degrees Celsius can spend more time outdoors absorbing fresh air. It is advisable to sleep with the windows open at night, but avoid drafts. (3) Sunbathing is very beneficial, especially from 8 to 10 am, as this is when there is more ultraviolet light, which has bactericidal properties. (4) The temperature in the sickroom should not exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The air should not be too dry. Methods should be used to sprinkle water in the room or hang wet sheets in the room. It is best to have water vapor in the room. A kettle can be placed on a brazier to boil water and produce water vapor. (5) The vomit and sputum of the sick child should be spat into a spittoon and strictly disinfected. It is even better to burn the sputum if it is spat into paper. (6) During the catarrhal stage, bed rest is necessary. Feed liquids. If it is an infant, dilute the milk. Prevent catching a cold. (7) Choose nutritious foods, such as malt extract, milk, milk powder, and glucose. Feed every two to three hours. If vomiting occurs immediately after eating, feed again. Avoid dry, powdery foods as they can irritate and easily cause coughing. Foods containing Vitamin D are especially good. (8) Clothing should be loose and warm; flannel is especially suitable. Keep warm and avoid getting cold again to prevent complications such as bronchopneumonia. (9) Using an abdominal support belt can prevent paroxysmal vomiting and provide comfort, as the abdominal muscles contract violently during paroxysmal coughs, compressing the full stomach and causing vomiting. (10) Hot water baths or sitz baths are good. (11) Consult a specialist to administer artificial sunlamp irradiation, relying on the effects of ultraviolet light to assist the patient's body. (12) Camphor oil can be applied to the chest daily, but caution should be taken to avoid burns or injury to the skin. (13) Consult a doctor for medication and bacterial lysate injections.</p>

<p>The Basic Principles of Pain Relief</p>
<p>This article describes the academic aspects of pain relief in scientific medicine. It is unlike the common practice of simply taking a painkiller tablet when one feels pain, without considering the cause of the pain, the nature of the medication, or how the pain relief works. The science of pain relief is indeed scientific medicine. First, it seeks to identify the cause of the pain. Second, it determines how to prevent the pain beforehand. Third, it assesses the suitability of local or nerve anesthesia. Fourth, it decides whether to use medication for pain relief or to use non-medication methods. If medication is used, it is necessary to understand what kind of medicine to use, why to use a particular medicine, what the medicine does within the body, and whether it is ultimately beneficial or harmful; what benefits and harms it has.</p>
<p>Many medications and surgical procedures for pain relief have been invented. When used properly, pain can be eliminated and overall health can be improved. When used improperly, temporary pain relief can be achieved, but at great expense to overall health. Here, I will briefly describe the principles of pain relief in medicine for the reader's study.</p>
<p>(1) Physiological Principles of Pain Relief: As stated at the beginning of this article, pain is caused when nerve receptors in the injured or problematic area transmit sensations to the brain via the spinal cord and brain pathways. The overall perception of pain resides in the brain, not in the injured or problematic area. Therefore, according to physiological principles, the following methods can be used to relieve pain: (1) Numbing or eliminating the sensory function of the receptors at the site of injury can stop the pain. (2) Numbing the nerve pathways to prevent transmission of sensations can also relieve pain. Local injection of anesthetics for pain relief works on this principle. Furthermore, performing anesthesia within the spinal canal can also eliminate pain. For example, injecting anesthetic into the spinal cord can eliminate pain from the abdomen down. Another method, commonly used and often misused, is to use narcotics to cloud the brain, making it unaware of pain, thereby supposedly relieving it. In reality, the pain and the underlying problem remain. When used appropriately, this method can be a temporary lifesaver in times of extreme suffering. However, when used inappropriately, it can be a source of great harm. The harmful effects of opium, morphine, and other strong narcotics stem from the improper use of pain relief methods.</p>
<p>(2) Understanding the Cause of Pain: In medical practice, although doctors immediately seek to relieve a patient's pain, they should not simply administer anesthetics to numb the brain without understanding the cause. Instead, they should rapidly identify the cause of the pain and then implement appropriate pain relief methods. Relieving pain with knowledge of the cause is conscious and targeted. Relieving pain without knowing the cause is unconscious and untargeted, and can sometimes be harmful. It is important to recognize that pain in the body can sometimes signal an emergency situation, requiring prompt and appropriate intervention to prevent life-threatening consequences. This is the guiding principle for pain relief in all surgical cases. Not only for severe pain, but also for common pain, one should first understand the cause and then use appropriate methods for relief. For example, a student may have headaches from reading too much due to nearsightedness. Another person may have headaches due to constipation. Yet another person may have headaches due to typhoid fever. And another person may have headaches due to syphilis. It is clear that using a single anesthetic or painkiller tablet to treat all these headaches is irrational. Therefore, thoroughly investigating the cause of any pain before implementing suitable pain relief methods is the modern approach in this age of scientific advancement.</p>
<p>(3) Pain Relief Without Harming the Body: In urgent cases of pain, the primary concern is obviously to relieve the pain immediately. However, one should not rely solely on taking or injecting painkillers for the sake of expediency. One should pay attention to using methods that do not harm the body, and may even improve health. As long as the science of pain relief is understood and applied properly, this is not a difficult task.</p>
<p>Modern medicine has revealed that frequent use of many pain relievers is harmful to the body. There are also many pain relief methods or surgeries that are beneficial and harmless to the body. Therefore, one should first choose those that are beneficial to the body. This knowledge of choice must be sought within genuine medical science. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e187">Common Sense About Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Renzhen</p>
<p>(36) The Reason Why Eyes Can See</p>
<p>Two small eyeballs can accompany a person throughout their life, constantly providing all the necessary images. What ingenious, exquisite, and lovely little organs they are! We should protect them with utmost care. The method of protection is to focus on their hygiene. I have already published articles on eye hygiene in this journal. Now I would like to discuss the reasons why they can see. Perhaps readers can develop an even greater love for them because of the complexity of their structure and the ingenuity of their physiology. Before I discuss the reason why eyes can see, I must first discuss the structure of the eye and its physiological functions, which will make it easier to understand.</p>
<p>1.  Structure of the Eye: The main part of the eye is the eyeball. The eyeball is composed of a membranous sac and the contents within the sac. It is connected to the brain via the optic nerve. A small portion of the front of the membranous sac is completely transparent, while the rest is opaque. This membranous sac is formed from three layers of membranes, namely the outer membrane, the middle membrane, and the inner membrane.</p>
<p>(1) Outer Membrane - also known as the fibrous coat of the eye. The transparent part of this membrane at the front is called the cornea (Figure 1) (commonly known as the "black of the eye"). The opaque part at the back is called the sclera (Figure 2) (commonly known as the "white of the eye").</p>
<p>(2) Middle Membrane - also known as the choroid. This membrane can be divided into two parts, the anterior part being the ciliary body (Figure 3) and the iris (Figure 4), and the posterior part being the choroid proper (Figure 5).</p>
<p>(3) Inner Membrane - also known as the nervous membrane, which is the retina (Figure 6). This membrane is where the optic nerve (Figure 7) is distributed.</p>
<p>As for the contents within the sac, there are three types: the lens (Figure 8), the aqueous humor (Figure 9), and the vitreous humor (Figure 10). (Please refer to the attached diagram).</p>
<p>(1) Cornea (2) Sclera (3) Ciliary Body (4) Iris (5) Choroid (6) Retina (7) Optic Nerve (8) Lens (9) Aqueous Humor (10) Vitreous Humor (11) Ciliary Muscle</p>
<p>2.  Physiological Function of the Eye: When discussing the physiological function of the eye, it is useful to use a camera as an analogy. The diaphragm of a camera is like the iris of the eye. Their functions are exactly the same. When we take photos, the diaphragm is narrowed in strong light and widened in weak light. Therefore, the pupil (the pupil is a small hole surrounded by the iris) usually shrinks when viewing objects in strong sunlight and dilates when viewing objects in the dark. The principle is the same. The converging lens is equivalent to the lens of the eye. Because the lens is rich in the power of refracting light, the dry plate is equivalent to the retina of the eye (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e188">Hermaphrodites <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongli</p>
<p>The definition of a hermaphrodite is an individual possessing both male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Hermaphrodites are divided into "true hermaphrodites" and "pseudo-hermaphrodites." A true hermaphrodite is an individual who not only possesses both male and female reproductive organs but also has both male and female reproductive functions. According to embryology, this type of hermaphrodite should not exist.</p>
<p>A pseudo-hermaphrodite has external genitalia that appear to be of both sexes, but the gonads are either testes or ovaries. Those with testes are called "male pseudo-hermaphrodites," and those with ovaries are called "female pseudo-hermaphrodites."</p>
<p>(1) Male Pseudo-Hermaphrodites: (Androgynoide) Account for three-quarters of the total. Their original sex is male, but the penis is small, resembling a woman's clitoris. The scrotum is not fused on both sides, resembling a woman's labia. At the same time, hypospadias is present, resembling a woman's vulva. Because the scrotum is incompletely developed, the testes are often hidden in the abdomen.</p>
<p>(2) Female Pseudo-Hermaphrodites: (gynandroide) Their original sex is female, but the clitoris is abnormally enlarged and protrudes like a male penis, capable of sexual intercourse. Parts of the left and right labia are fused together, resembling a male scrotum. If the ovaries descend into the labia, they are even more similar to male genitalia.</p>
<p>These two types of pseudo-hermaphrodites often undergo special physiological changes due to environmental factors or sexual activity. For example, male pseudo-hermaphrodites often associate with women, and over time, their behavior and thoughts become more feminine. Their bodies also undergo changes, such as a delicate voice, a slender waist, long sideburns and arched eyebrows, enlarged breasts, and wide hips, with fully developed curves in all parts of the body. The most peculiar thing is that the genitals sometimes ooze blood, but this blood should not be mistaken for menstruation, as it is mostly caused by bleeding from sexual intercourse injuries.</p>
<p>Female pseudo-hermaphrodites live and interact with men daily, their lifestyles are the same as men, so their bodies become developed and strong, their muscles protrude, and soon they also have a rough appearance.</p>
<p>In medical history, there is a record of a woman named Mary, who lived to be eighty-four years old. She had always been the head of her household, but after her death, an autopsy revealed that she was originally a male.</p>
<p>Another person married a wife for six years. One day, a doctor accidentally discovered that his wife was originally a male. However, because their love was so strong, they could not bear to part despite this great shock. From then on, they continued their homosexual love life as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>In summary, pseudo-hermaphrodites are caused by abnormal or deformed embryonic physiological development, similar to cleft lip infants or imperforate anus. People lacking medical knowledge often believe that the birth of a hermaphrodite is the result of sins committed in a previous life. The parents of hermaphrodite children often consider them to be unlucky, so they often abandon them. However, after detailed explanation, this absurd prejudice should be eliminated!</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (42) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Clinical Course</p>
<p>B. What is meant by mid-field infiltration? The origin of this term is related to X-ray examinations. For the convenience of examination, the left and right lungs are divided into three parts, namely the upper, middle, and lower fields. This is different from the usual anatomical division of lung lobes. The middle field includes the area below the second rib and above the fifth rib. This area includes parts of both the upper and middle lobes of the lung (speaking only of the right side). According to past theories, the initial site of pulmonary tuberculosis was limited to the area within the lung apex. Now we know that this is not the case. It is located in a part close to the underside of the collarbone, and on the surface of the lung. This state is medically termed independent infiltration. Its location is within the scope of the mid-field, so this type also has the specific names "mid-field infiltration" or "mid-field tuberculosis." Its clinical symptoms are not numerous. Generally, the onset is somewhat acute, with conditions similar to those of influenza. Coughing and excessive phlegm will be discovered later. Although the amount of sputum is not large, tubercle bacilli can sometimes be detected. The percussion sound is weaker, and the breath sounds have slight changes at the branch of the trachea, but sometimes physical examination yields no results. The temperature sometimes decreases. Although the disease is progressing, the general condition is sometimes very good, and there is no difference from normal people. The most powerful proof of this aspect is, of course, thanks to the X-ray examination procedure! In most cases, the infiltrated part shrinks and hardens, resulting in recovery. In other cases, caseous degeneration causes liquefaction, resulting in the development of early cavities. In still other cases, extreme spread to the entire lobe of the lung results in caseous pneumonia, which has the worst prognosis, but ultimately accounts for a very small proportion.</p>
<p>C. The term apical tuberculosis was very popular in the past, but it is definitely not the initial site of the lesion. According to recent evidence, most cases are due to the atrophy of mid-field tuberculosis and its transfer to the lung apex. Therefore, this type is secondary and progresses through the lymphatic or vascular system. Its course is mostly chronic, and clinically, it also has a latent state, with no significant symptoms. Unless the area of infiltration is very large, the continued spread of the tracheal branches and vascular system is possible. (End of this chapter, to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e190">How to Obtain a Stable Market and Pacify People's Hearts <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Since the end of the year's accounting and the reopening of businesses, the money market has become tight, and lending has contracted, even more so than before. In previous years, interbank lending was practically free during this period, but this year, the opening rate was already two percent, and later gradually rose to over ten percent. Around the Lantern Festival in the lunar calendar, when businesses were submitting reports of past transactions, there were reports of restrictions on the amount of credit and stricter selection of clients than in previous years. This shows that the current financial situation in Shanghai, the cautious and fearful attitude of those in the industry, and the prosperity or decline of the money market are significantly different from the past, which is clearly visible. Without a solution, this year's working capital for industry and commerce will be difficult to turn over, business operations will be difficult, and the period of "final settlement" will be even closer.</p>
<p>Amidst these difficult and distressed voices, the government has established a Financial Advisory Committee to seek solutions and plan for currency system reform without adopting superficial shortcuts or extreme policies, and without shaking public confidence or hindering the construction of economic prospects. On the one hand, it encourages foreign merchants to import silver, granting tax-free certificates upon import for those importing over 500,000 ounces, and exempting them from taxes upon re-export. As for the money industry, there are three points seen in the newspapers: (1) The collateral loans previously issued by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will be settled every three months to facilitate turnover. (2) Credit loans will not be granted to merchants purchasing foreign goods, especially those selling luxury goods, in order to reduce import surpluses and silver exports. (3) Before the market returns to normal, all businesses should adopt the most cautious attitude, and unlimited credit loans should be handled with utmost care to build up strength, and safe safeguards should be provided for depositors. Although those in the money industry say that the above is "not to be believed," lending must consider the other party's own creditworthiness and act within its means, which is the operating principle of the money industry this year. In terms of organizations, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and local associations have discussed (1) how to stabilize the local market and improve the general business environment, and (2) how the financial and industrial and commercial sectors should seek cooperation to overcome difficulties and seek market recovery during this recession. The result of the discussion is to stabilize the current market, pacify people's hearts, and seek mutual assistance and cooperation between the financial and industrial and commercial sectors within the possible range. In addition, in the United States, which is closely related to the silver market, silver advocates have re-emerged after the gold clause ruling, advocating (1) raising the price of silver to the statutory price of $1.29 per ounce, based on which silver certificates are issued, (2) promptly implementing the Treasury Department's procedure for recovering silver, and (3) allowing international debts to be offset by silver. Recently, the price of gold in Shanghai has also fallen below 900 yuan due to various reasons. Future changes are imminent. However, stability cannot be achieved without this change. Therefore, change may well be a sign of stability. Whether it is a blessing or a curse depends on how we plan for ourselves!</p>
<p>The recent outflow of silver has its external causes and existing loopholes, but if general opinions were slightly more cautious, it would not have caused such panic. Since silver became expensive, people have been talking about and focusing on the silver issue. We admire those who care about current affairs, and we do not expect everyone to have the same opinion. The more we discuss, the more precise we become, so we should not be afraid of detailed discussions. However, there must be a premise: to be internally relevant to the national situation and externally responsive to the times. If we simply parrot others, swallow things whole, disregard facts, and fail to observe advantages and disadvantages, then Yuan Shikai also suspended the exchange of banknotes, and Wuhan also centralized cash. What were the results? It is not difficult to recall. However, we must also understand that foreign countries can succeed because they have the ability to do so. We cannot simply transplant everything to China and expect it to work without any obstacles. Foreign countries do not have concessions; the coming and going of foreign warships is not as direct and unhindered as in China, and they are not stationed permanently; the inland river transportation in foreign countries is probably not as long-term operated by foreigners as in China, and there is no way to recover it; the port inspections in foreign countries are definitely not as scattered and chaotic as in China, allowing for easy smuggling; coupled with our own numerous weaknesses, it is truly a hundred holes and thousands of sores, and there is no time to remedy them. Therefore, every reform, if not handled carefully, will create another opportunity for foreign merchants. And the recent "worship of foreigners" mentality is as fanatical as the "contempt for foreigners" mentality thirty years ago. In the past, the problem was too much confidence, and now the problem is too little confidence, which is another case of excess or deficiency. As a result, foreigners' words and actions are regarded as divine, with the idea that "words are the law of the world" and "waiting for a sage for a hundred generations without doubt." However, they do not know that "it should be based on oneself and verified by the people." Therefore, even though the words have not been put into action, they are enough to warn those who have silver and move those who have no goods. Those who load silver and transport it to Hong Kong and other places are not all because silver is expensive, but because they are afraid of the opinions and propositions of the people of the time and dare not keep it. This is not only true for foreign merchants, but also for Chinese merchants who sell large amounts of bonds, buy and store foreign currency in Hong Kong, and hedge against the pound sterling. In name, they are seeking profit, but in their minds, are they not planning for the worst? I have always suspected that general discussions are flawed by recklessness, and that making speeches and declarations is fashionable. Speakers are unintentional, but listeners are warned. In recent years, there have been many lessons of this kind, but people forget them after the event, and the old habits remain. Now, cash has not been centralized, and currency has not been inflated, but lofty arguments are flourishing, and silver has already disappeared without wings, leading to the embarrassing situation in the market last winter. Sometimes it is compared to illness. Expensive gold and cheap silver, or expensive silver and cheap gold coins, are like a temporary cold. Those with strong bodies can resist it, and they are not afraid of the strong霸道 medicine, which is the currency policy of foreigners. What Chinese people suffer from is the temptation of light and beautiful foreign goods for decades. They are addicted to them, exhausting their energy and spirit, and becoming weaker day by day. They still do not know how to restrain themselves and nurture their health, strengthen the foundation and consolidate the origin. They still want to indulge in pleasure and extravagance, just like the prodigal sons of bankrupt families who eat up their entire fortunes. How can they not be exhausted and die suddenly? They want to treat consumption with medicine for a cold, which is useless.</p>
<p>However, there are things that have the power to disrupt the market and hinder finance, which cannot be compared to lofty theories. The most important thing is the speculators in the market. Market speculation is not surprising in itself, but the speculation of these people is alarming and cannot be achieved by ordinary people. They have access to information that ordinary people cannot know, complain about, expect, or utilize. They can find out things in advance and make arrangements in advance. Often, it is called a rumor beforehand, but it is proven to be true afterwards. Therefore, ordinary people regard rumors as not rumors, which makes it easier for rumors to occur in the market. Since the market is long-term shrouded in pseudo-rumors, how can people's hearts be at peace? When the margin system was changed to use customs gold as the settlement price, when silver export taxes were increased and countervailing duties were levied, the government had not made any statements, and newspapers had not reported anything, but some people in the market had already made preparations and taken steps in advance. As expected, they did not exceed the expectations of these people, and they profited from it. How magical is their skill? Moreover, the manipulation of the securities market, at a time of tight money and market unrest, disregards the dangers to the country, the nation, and the economy, and the boldness of speculators in wildly rising and falling prices is truly astonishing. If this is not corrected for a long time, the market will always be under the control of speculative forces. How can it be stable? Therefore, the difficulties and adversities that come are self-inflicted, and there is no need to blame heaven or others. Does the Book of Songs not say, "Seek much happiness for yourself"? Does the proverb not say, "He who tied the bell must untie it"? That is what it means.</p>
<p>Some people think that stabilizing the market depends on flexible turnover and sufficient chips. Why not borrow a foreign debt to make adjustments? They do not know that borrowing debt requires qualifications. With qualifications, all conditions can be cheap. Without such qualifications, it is like a poor person borrowing usurious loans, with harsh conditions and increased principal and interest. Furthermore, the new method of trade now is almost reverting to the ancient times of bartering. The new method of lending also wants to use goods as cash. Therefore, what is borrowed is often goods, and what is repaid is still cash. If what is borrowed is industrial products, it will help them promote their products and create a monopoly market, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Even if what is borrowed is cash, but the conditions are harsh, binding, and involve all future rights, it is like "curing the sore in front of you, but cutting out the flesh in your heart." Except for those who intend to make a desperate gamble, I think no one dares to accept it.</p>
<p>If the Shanghai market wants to be stable, (1) it still needs solutions for the rural economy. If the rural economy is prosperous, the city will naturally prosper. However, how to flow funds into the countryside, how the countryside can accept these funds, and how to use these funds are all major issues that cannot be covered in this article. (2) Eliminate the causes of market unrest, namely the real estate issue. Real estate has been regarded as the best investment, and with the manipulation of real estate developers, prices have risen day and night, resulting in prices that are not commensurate with the market environment. In the bustling city, there are often large plots of vacant land waiting to be sold, and vacant houses are lined up, but there are no tenants. If the market is good, real estate can barely maintain the status quo. Unfortunately, it also coincided with last year's market situation. Foreign banks transported their silver deposits overseas, and they did not want to renew their collateral loans. Chinese banks saw the situation and tried to protect themselves, and they did not dare to bear too much. The once-popular real estate industry became stagnant, and prices fell, and no one consulted it. In the past, it turned mud into gold, but today it turns into... [missing text in original]. The law is changed, and new valuations of real estate are revised so that they can still circulate in the market; [missing text in original]... the burden of industrial and commercial households, and restore the prosperity of the market. (3) Gold... [missing text in original] lending is a matter of course. However, in the financial industry itself, a spirit of mutual assistance should be shown, with mutual exchange of resources and mutual compensation for surpluses and deficits. Maintaining credit among colleagues is the key to securing one's own business strategy. In cooperation with industry and commerce, sincere cooperation should be sought. Industrial and commercial enterprises should provide the financial industry with their internal realities. The financial industry should also proceed from the major premise of supporting the development of industry and commerce and national interests. Regardless of the size of the enterprise, it should only ask whether the enterprise is important, whether it is promising, and whether the inflexibility of turnover is a temporary phenomenon, and whether the sluggishness of business is the trend of the times. It may formulate improvement strategies for it, or point out its gains and losses, or grant it overdrafts and renewals, or provide it with appropriate funds, so as not to be constrained by narrow and cautious lending. However, we should also be mindful of the difficulties of the financial industry itself, because it is easy to lend money but difficult to recover it. On the one hand, deposits are waiting to be paid, and on the other hand, loans are difficult to recover. If a run on deposits occurs at maturity, it will affect the overall situation with a single hair. Therefore, we hope that the financial industry will support industry and commerce, and we also hope that large depositors will support the national financial industry, so as not to put the national economy in a desperate situation and turn it into an economic aggressor, increasing its momentum. (4) Suppress market rumors to pacify people's hearts. How can market rumors be eliminated? Eliminate the rumors that are like rumors. Rumors are born from speculation, association, pseudo-observations, and facts that are brewing. However, if we can meet each other with sincerity, "words will be believed by the people, and actions will be pleasing to the people," then not only can rumors be quelled, but everything can be done. Someone may say that in today's world, scheming is used, and power is valued. Talking about sincerity in the market is simply not knowing the times. This is true. But if you ask someone in the industrial and commercial sector how to trade, they will answer directly, "Trade with integrity and trustworthiness." Integrity is sincerity. Without sincerity, how can there be trust? How can there be righteousness? Therefore, the problem today is that we cannot trust each other and meet each other with sincerity. If we can be sincere and trustworthy, then we will naturally be stable.</p>

<p>— Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>It is shameful to say that my great China, unable to control its environment, is instead controlled by it, becoming a weak victim. Since countries with the gold standard, such as Britain and Japan, felt the different advantages and disadvantages of currency contraction and expansion and sought their own ways out, they successively abandoned the gold standard. Before long, the United States also adopted the same policy, abandoning the gold standard and further buying silver abroad, causing silver prices to suddenly rise. However, China is a country that uses silver, and after the price of silver increased, the value of Chinese currency increased accordingly, and prices also fell, creating an unparalleled opportunity for various countries to expand their trade with China. However, China's exports suffered significant obstacles due to the daily rise of silver currency exchange rates against other countries' currencies, resulting in even more imports exceeding exports. The outflow of silver will undoubtedly continue to increase, which will inevitably affect China's currency reserves, and may even endanger their stability!</p>
<p>Since the outflow of silver is extremely serious, there must be urgent policies to curb it. Therefore, the financial authorities took decisive measures to implement silver export taxes. Its purpose is obviously to prevent the export of silver, which can also be said to be a method of prohibition through taxation. However, the intention is to lower the domestic silver price, so that it is divorced from the foreign silver price. The domestic silver price will not rise sharply with the foreign silver price, and China's price level will not fall due to the rise of the foreign silver price. This is a temporary emergency and a unilateral remedy, which is extremely beneficial to the export of Chinese goods, and can indirectly prevent the import of foreign goods, which is also a way to reduce the excess of imports over exports. That being said, after the silver tax was levied, the difference between domestic and foreign silver prices became more disparate, leading to the fact of smuggling silver out of the country. Although it has attracted the attention of the authorities and the public, it is known that China's customs anti-smuggling organization is immature, and the markets in Hong Kong and Dalian are closely linked to the mainland. Foreign merchant ships are also protected by consular jurisdiction, so smuggling methods are ingenious and difficult to prevent: one way is to use transit, and the other is to use smuggling. More use is made of the convenience that Central Bank notes can be cashed everywhere, regarding them as a medium for exporting silver. A large amount of Central Bank notes are collected in Shanghai and taken to Tianjin and Beiping for cashing, after which they can be transported out of the country through various passes of the Great Wall, and then transported to foreign countries via Dalian or other ports. Therefore, Central Bank notes in the market once had a premium, and the premium of Yuan coins was even more alarming, reaching 90 yuan per 10,000. It can be seen that there are indeed many unscrupulous profiteers. It is certainly not easy to ban smuggling due to factual limitations, but the public is therefore full of rumors, such as nationalizing silver, implementing inconvertible paper money, etc. Most of them are speculations by speculators, which this article dares not discuss. However, if silver leaks out without any control, using limited legal tender to supply the insatiable outflow is a major event that no one can deny! It is very likely to affect China's currency fund. Therefore, the situation of various Chinese banks issuing paper money is worth observing in the current tense situation of the silver issue.</p>
<p>The history of formal paper money issuance by banks in our country is still short. After the opening of the Commercial Bank of China in the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, it began to issue banknotes in imitation of foreign banks' exchange certificates, which was the beginning of Chinese banks issuing banknotes. Later, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications followed suit. However, at first, the public's belief in banknotes was minimal, and the ability to circulate was far less extensive than it is today. I still remember that before the tenth year of the Republic of China, in the larger county towns in the interior, silver dollars and banknotes still had to be entered into accounts at different levels. Therefore, in the year before the founding of the Republic of China, the amount of exchange certificates issued by the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China was only more than 755,000 yuan, which shows that the circulation of paper money was very limited in the past. The competition from foreign banks' exchange certificates was also one of the reasons why it was difficult to promote Chinese banks' paper money. After the May 30th Massacre, the Chinese people felt the terror of imperialist economic aggression and refused to use foreign banknotes. Except in treaty ports, where there were no significant results under the threat of foreign force, the exchange certificates of foreign banks in the interior gradually disappeared, creating an opportunity for the promotion of Chinese banks' paper money, which was also the beginning of the increase in the amount of paper money issued by Chinese banks. At that time, the public's trust in paper money also underwent a major change due to the passage of time.</p>
<p>The system of issuing paper money varies from country to country. Although our country's financial authorities did not initially know that foreign banks issuing paper money would lose national sovereignty and impose restrictions, they strongly advocated the unification of domestic bank paper money. The single issuance system was adopted, that is, the right to issue paper money was exclusively enjoyed by the Central Bank. Therefore, in the fourth year of the Republic of China, the former government promulgated five articles of regulations to ban paper money. However, the chaos in our country's financial system is undeniable, and due to political relations, it has in fact changed from a nominally single issuance system to a multiple issuance system. In addition to the Central Bank, other banks, with the permission of the government, can also obtain the right to issue paper money, and this trend has continued to the present. The so-called Central Bank at that time referred to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, which managed the national treasury. Now, in addition to the Central Bank, there are ten banks, namely, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China-South Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Commercial Bank of China, the Sze Ming Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Reclamation Bank, the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, which are all banks specially authorized by the government to issue paper money. Among them, the China-South Bank, after obtaining the right to issue paper money, re-affiliated with the Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Continental Bank, and the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, adopting a joint reserve issuance system, jointly organizing the Four Banks Reserve Treasury, which became a mutually supportive issuance system. In addition to the above, there is also the indirect issuance certificate system created in the early years of the Republic of China, which is unique to various countries. At the beginning of the creation, the original intention was to enable the banks that directly issued exchange certificates to have the amount of circulation greatly increased due to the promotion of the indirectly issued certificate banks. Other banks with weaker strength would find it more difficult to issue on their own, and the opportunity to get involved would be reduced. Moreover, after the implementation of the certificate system, banks that had not obtained the right to issue paper money, since they had the opportunity to issue indirectly, did not need to rush to seek the right to issue paper money. Therefore, the creation of the certificate system was a legitimate remedy under the advocacy of the single issuance system because it could not avoid the multiple issuance system.</p>
<p>Chinese banks' paper money has gained considerable trust in society today, but the increase or decrease in the number of issues changes with the ebb and flow of the economic situation. Moreover, due to the difference in financial seasons, there will inevitably be a large difference. However, after looking at the total amount of paper money issued by various Chinese commercial banks in Shanghai recently, I feel that the expansion of promotion ability has made great progress in the recent short term.</p>
<p>(Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>Central Bank 89,034,250</p>
<p>Bank of China 136,868,530</p>
<p>Bank of Communications 57,883,500</p>
<p>Four Banks Reserve Treasury 32,070,473</p>
<p>China Industrial Bank 33,645,413</p>
<p>Commercial Bank of China 24,302,900</p>
<p>Sze Ming Bank 18,310,300</p>
<p>Zhejiang Industrial Bank 9,247,838</p>
<p>Reclamation Bank 7,084,000</p>
<p>Agricultural and Industrial Bank 6,167,262</p>
<p>Agricultural and Commercial Bank …………</p>
<p>Excluding the missing figures for the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the total number of issues in the above table reached more than 410 million yuan. The Central Bank has made the fastest progress. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was only more than 11 million yuan, which is more than seven times the current amount. In the inspection report of the bank in January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, it was still only more than 46 million yuan, which is also twice as much as today. According to the report of the first inspection of the Bank of China in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the amount of issuance was 90 million yuan, which has also increased by 50%. Therefore, based on the total number of issues of various banks in the 17th year of the Republic of China, it was only more than 274 million yuan, which has increased by 136 million yuan compared with the recent figures. The reasons for the increase are certainly more than one, but the result of the increase is that the country's cash is concentrated unexpectedly. In recent years, rural areas across the country have been on the verge of bankruptcy. Organizations that have always played a role in regulating rural finance in the interior have lost their ability to control, causing funds in the interior to flow to cities. Moreover, the rampant banditry and heavy thorns everywhere have caused the possibility of cash staying in the interior to suddenly shrink to below zero. These are all the reasons for the concentration of cash as a whole, which is also a major driving force for the promotion of paper money in recent years. Therefore, the concentration of cash has opened up the situation of paper money replacing legal tender. As for the advantages and disadvantages of the entire national economy, because the effects are different, it is impossible to generalize.</p>
<p>The regulations on paper money reserves are that cash reserves must be at least 60% and guarantee reserves must be at most 40%. Cash reserves are limited to cash and raw gold and silver. Government-issued securities, real estate, and even short-term reliable commercial paper can all be used as guarantee reserves. The purpose of issuing paper money is to use 60% of cash to use 100% of paper money, and invisibly obtain 40% of the issuance amount due to the unprofitable nature of guarantee reserves. However, during the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, the Shanghai money shop industry once unofficially unanimously advocated that the 60% cash reserve must be fully paid. It can be seen that the so-called minimum 60% cash reserve was not always fully implemented in the past, so wouldn't the benefit of issuing paper money be even greater! When the certificate system was first implemented, the regulations on reserves were not as strict as they are now. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank signed a certificate contract with the Bank of China, setting a record for the Chinese paper money certificate system. According to the certificate regulations set by the Bank of China, anyone who receives exchange certificates from the Bank of China must have 70% cash and 30% securities before they can receive 100% of the banknotes. However, in fact, this regulation was not uniform. For example, Zhejiang Industrial Bank only used 50% cash, 15% securities, and 25% short-term bills, and the Bank of China still had to pay interest on the cash provided to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. It can be seen that there was no fixed legal percentage for paper money reserves at that time. However, later, certificate banks sprang up one after another, and the Bank of China also slightly changed the certificate regulations, changing the cash from 50% to 60%, securities or real estate remained at 30%, and another 10% was added for short-term bills, which could be cashed at any time if necessary. The current certificate regulations are generally adopted by various banks according to this principle. However, each certificate bank has the obligation to suspend cashing when the bank issuing paper money experiences a run, which provides strong protection for the bank directly issuing paper money to cope with any turmoil, and can also be said to be a kind of guarantee given by the certificate banks.</p>
<p>Since the trend of certificate issuance has been opened and the effect has gradually become apparent, the number of banks requesting certificates from banks directly issuing paper money has increased year by year. Until recently, almost every bank that has not obtained the right to issue paper money and money shops with wider operations have obtained certificates, and at the same time, they recognize certificate issuance as a unique business item. In the past six or seven years, the promotion of paper money has been so rapid, which is also one of the reasons. However, whether it is a directly issuing bank or an indirectly issuing certificate bank, they must put the paper money into circulation, hoping that it will circulate in society, and the longer it lasts, the more profitable it will be. Of course, they hope that customers will use it for the method of putting paper money into circulation. However, there are currently eleven banks issuing paper money in Shanghai alone, and certificate banks are everywhere, so the competition is extremely fierce. Considering what customers want, the supply is far from enough. If paper money cannot be put into circulation, not only will there be no profit, but also interest losses will have to be borne. Therefore, they try every possible means to put it into circulation at any time and anywhere. All large-scale factories distribute wages, and huge amounts of money are used to purchase agricultural products from the interior, all of which can spread huge amounts of money to the general public in one day. The wider the scope of distribution, the slower the time it takes for the distributed paper money to return to the bank. Therefore, these occasions where money is needed are also generally recognized as the most suitable places for promoting paper money. Therefore, if commercial and industrial organizations in Shanghai and larger stores need banknotes, they can notify the bank or certificate bank by telephone, instructing them to send the banknotes, and only need to exchange them for a money shop draft with a later date. In addition, the bank or certificate bank subsidizes the store a handling fee of 6 yuan per 10,000 yuan. Even regular customers can usually pay their bills seven days later when using banknotes. More superior stores can have a ten-day cycle, but the minimum amount used is 1,000 yuan. In recent years, many small money shops have carried banknotes with letterheads to the interior to exchange them with various money shops, and the small money shops separately pay the exchange fee. In this way, the infighting between banknotes is inevitable, and the opposition that gradually forms is incompatible. Therefore, the dispute between each other is becoming more and more intense, and the benefits of banknotes are becoming more and more marginal. At present, it is almost stepping into another situation of mutual killing!</p>
<p>The circulation of paper money has such unreasonable phenomena as described above. However, the creation of the certificate system was originally a remedy for the inevitable multiple issuance under the advocacy of single issuance. Now it has instead formed a competition among multiple parties, so it is obvious that this paper money is not really needed by society. Today, when the number of bank issues has increased sharply, there is also an unavoidable question of exaggeration. Since the silver tax was levied, society has been worried about the increase in smuggling. The foreign exchange rate has suddenly increased, and the result of the outflow of silver and goods has made the silver base extremely tight. Therefore, at the end of the year, various money shops in Shanghai experienced a major storm. Now, at the beginning of the early spring when various industries have not yet started, the foreign exchange rate is high, so the opportunity for paper money to stay in society is suddenly reduced, which will inevitably speed up the rate of return to the bank. Moreover, paper money cannot be used in conjunction with spot goods according to the promotion methods previously adopted by various banks. After the silver tax is levied, the price of silver changes into two types: Chinese and world. At this moment, when it is impossible to ban the export of smuggled silver, the price of silver coins and paper money will be more disparate, and the premium of Yuan coins can be used as clear evidence. The sudden increase in the cashing of paper money is therefore inevitable. The recent serious situations such as the freezing of funds and the run on banknotes can be said to have originated from this. If we further investigate the current issuance amount of paper money in Shanghai, which is more than 410 million yuan, according to the legal 60% cash reserve, there are currently about 250 million yuan of silver and goods in Shanghai. Although this reserve is independent, its effect cannot be regarded as a reserve fund for short-term deposits and savings deposits between banks. According to the statistics of various savings banks in Shanghai last year, the savings deposits alone amounted to more than 328 million yuan, which is much larger than the current cash reserve of paper money. Therefore, a large increase in the amount of silver and goods in Shanghai is needed, and the result of the cashing of banknotes not only has the possibility of causing funds to flee, but also gives a strong blow to the indirect preparation of savings deposits. Therefore, the original intention of issuing paper money is nothing more than to save the cost of precious metals, smooth the sluggishness of finance, and relieve the shortage of legal tender. Now, due to the influence of the high price of silver abroad, the inherent center of gravity of paper money has been lost. Of course, we urgently need effective relief. The way to do this now is: on the one hand, we can only imitate the method of jointly establishing a public treasury by various banks set by the Northern Government in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and quickly establish a public treasury by the Bankers' Association in important ports such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou, and make the preparations public to show great trust. Then, on the one hand, limit the cashing of paper money, so that the smuggling of silver and goods will be naturally prohibited. If the transportation of silver is not prohibited, the silver base in the market will become less and less. Since the paper money reserve is based on silver and goods as the mainstream, if the silver base is small, the circulation of paper money will inevitably shrink due to it, and it will not be possible to expand it again for a while. Then, there will be less and less bargaining chips in the market, and the power of the financial community to lend money will naturally shrink accordingly. Therefore, the resulting result is to lower prices, raise interest rates, and the entire national economy may feel threatened at the same time. Then! Establishing a public treasury invisibly unifies the issuance, and then limiting the cashing of paper money, isn't it the key to opening up the current crisis of the outflow of silver and goods and protecting the stability of currency reserves? However, recently there have been rumors in the market that Chinese businessmen have lost 50 million yuan of gold in the trading of American stocks. At this moment, China is thirsty for financial stability. The financial authorities should strictly ban all speculative organizations that are enough to shake China's currency fund.</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Origin of the Financial Industry Panic <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Guangzhao</p>
<p>Characteristics of China's Economic Panic — The severity of China's economic panic has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) Imperialism Shifting Panic to China — Imperialism promotes the sale of surplus cheap goods to China, making it impossible for China's nascent national industries to resist, leading to their collapse.</p>
<p>(2) Shrinking Foreign Markets — Capitalist countries are experiencing their own panic, erecting tariff barriers, and China's exports have plummeted. It is unable to compete in foreign markets, resulting in huge deficits in international payments every year.</p>
<p>(3) Outflow of Silver — In addition to using silver to offset trade deficits, since capitalist countries abandoned the gold standard, they have further increased the price of silver to increase China's purchasing power and buy silver, causing the outflow of silver. This puts China's finances in extreme chaos, and the countryside is again falling into stark bankruptcy?</p>
<p>The Position of Banks in Society — Banks are social financial circulation organs, using funds to invest in industry and commerce to increase circulation speed and expand production. However, the economic panic caused by the imbalance between capitalist production and consumption has shaken the foundations of banks. The collapse of various industrial sectors has implicated banks, leading to the same fate of frequent bankruptcies. The purpose of this article is to reveal the stagnation of China's industry and commerce and the impact of various factors, and to explain the reasons for the collapse of clearing houses:</p>
<p>Stagnation of Industry and Commerce — According to the annual national industrial and commercial conditions published by the International Trade Bureau in the 23rd year, the general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton Textile Industry — The number of spindles stopped reached 1,224,267, and the average stoppage time was 1-83 hours. The reason is expensive cotton and cheap yarn. Since this year, on the one hand, the supply of cotton is insufficient, and at the same time, American cotton has also risen in price. On the other hand, yarn prices have been greatly reduced due to sluggish sales of existing yarn. The difference between cotton and cotton yarn has formed a scissor-shaped difference, causing the yarn industry to be on the verge of collapse. On the one hand, it is also subject to the pressure of Japanese yarn factories, which is also a particularly important reason.</p>
<p>(2) Withering of the Silk Industry — In the 23rd year, the quantity of raw silk exported from my country decreased greatly. From January to October, exports were only 26,170 metric tons, worth 18,043,752 yuan, a decrease of 33% compared with the same period last year, and a decrease in value of 56%. According to the Shishi Xinbao on January 21 this year, after the sharp reduction in silk exports, factories in various places were unable to maintain operations and were almost completely shut down. Taking Shanghai as an example, only 11 factories are barely operating. The most prosperous time was 117 factories, which is now less than one-tenth.</p>
<p>(3) Flour Industry — Since the loss of the Northeast, my country's flour industry has been in dire straits almost every day. Not only was there no turnaround in the 23rd year, but the situation worsened, especially in the first half of the year. Due to overproduction and falling market conditions, it was difficult for various factories to maintain operations, and they successively stopped or reduced production. After June, due to lack of rain, the purchase volume in the interior increased, and the problem of the Ping-Shen Railway being open to traffic was resolved, and the sales of flour in North China turned prosperous, and the flour market turned around. In early October, the downward trend intensified again, and the flour market returned to the depressed state of the first half of the year. However, the large reduction in foreign flour imports this year is a special phenomenon, due to my country's increased import tax on wheat flour and the weak purchasing power of the people in the interior.</p>
<p>(4) Tea Market — More stable. A total of 428,367 piculs of tea leaves were exported, an increase of 18% compared with the same period last year, worth 31,842,683 national currency, an increase of about 8% compared with last year.</p>
<p>(5) Cement and Matches — From January to June, 246,027,280 kilograms of cement were produced, a decrease of 2% compared with the same period last year, while sales increased. The production and sales of matches both shrank, with production decreasing by about 20% compared with the same period last year, and sales decreasing by about 18%. The reasons for the shrinkage are roughly: 1. Increased consolidated tax, increased costs; 2. Increased tax evasion, reduced prices; 3. There are still many foreign matches imported, especially the increased production of foreign-owned match factories in China, which has put great pressure on Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>(6) Coal and Rubber — In the past, my country used one-fourth of its coal and had to rely on foreign coal supply. After the Ministry of Finance revised and increased import tax rates, the cost of foreign coal increased and shipments to China decreased, and coal prices also fell. The operating conditions of rubber factories have declined in terms of production, sales are sluggish, and coupled with competition from the same industry and foreign goods, market prices have repeatedly fallen.</p>
<p>Repercussions of the U.S. Silver Purchasing Policy — Since the United States implemented an inflationary policy, it has raised the price of silver and bought silver, resulting in a continuous outflow of silver from China. According to last year's customs statistics, the total amount of silver exported was more than 280 million yuan. The money supply is tight, and the financial industry is fundamentally shaken. The most obvious example is that more than 20 silver firms in Shantou closed down last year because they could not cash out due to the outflow of silver. According to the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily on November 7: "It is found that silver merchants in Shantou have purchased millions of yuan of silver from Shanghai in recent days to import, and they have the intention to maintain finance, and it is more than enough to handle the cash redemption of guaranteed banknotes. However, these people do not do this. All the imported silver dollars are stored, and the financial market is as dry as before. The Hong Kong exchange rate has soared in recent days, and unscrupulous silver merchants have even transported silver to Hong Kong privately (a profit of 100 to 200 yuan can be made for every 1,000 yuan). Each time, the larger amounts reach more than 100,000, although they have been repeatedly seized and confiscated, they still rush to it like water flows downward, and they still risk the law and smuggle as before." Last year, in order to prevent the outflow of silver, the Ministry of Finance increased the silver export tax and levied a balancing tax, but silver continued to flow out. The interbank lending rate has risen to 60%. According to the China News Extra on the 2nd of this month, a telegram from Washington stated: "The silver purchase policy has disrupted China's finances, and officials have expressed regret." "The U.S. government feels powerless to help China's financial crisis. Officials here are well aware of the financial situation in Shanghai and express regret for the plight of China's major commercial ports, saying that the United States has no choice but to abide by its previous commitments to avoid disrupting China's finances with the silver purchase plan. ... " Recently, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have stated that they have purchased 20 million yuan of silver and specially released large sums of money to maintain the market during the old New Year, which seems to be able to safely get through the New Year. However, even money houses, which have always been known for their stability, have gone bankrupt in as many as four cases, and major banks have also experienced bank runs. They can only ease the atmosphere for a while, and there are countless crises lurking.</p>
<p>Unsoundness of the Organization Itself — Last year, 13 new banks were established in Shanghai alone, and 7 were closed (this year there is also the Tongyi Bank). According to the conversation of Lin Kanghou, the secretary-general of the Bankers' Association, recorded in the Shishi Xinbao on January 23, he said: "In recent years, the banking industry in this city has been slightly inferior due to the bankruptcy of the rural areas in the interior. In addition, last year, the interior was barren, and it was affected by the U.S. silver policy, resulting in a strange tightness of silver. Small banks with generally unsound organizations and insufficient strength will be stranded and closed or suspended even if they are occasionally unable to turn around." It is estimated that those who closed or went bankrupt last year were: China Industrial Development, Shanghai Overseas Chinese Trust Company, Wuhua Bank, Shanghai Oriental Trust Company, Jiande Bank, Yongan Silver Company, and Huadong Commercial Bank. In particular, the sensational Yongan Silver Company, registered with the Chinese government and filed with the U.S. government, has a magnificent scale, but only less than 200,000 of the 1 million capital was collected, resulting in its inability to turn around and stranding.</p>
<p>Abnormal Development — The bankruptcy of rural areas in the interior and the warlords' melee resulted in cash being concentrated in cities. (For example, the Sichuan warlords' remittances to Shanghai recently rose to 1,700 yuan.) Therefore, banks sprang up like mushrooms after rain, but they suffered from a lack of funds and no way out. In the midst of industrial stagnation, banks mostly adopted a tight policy and did not dare to invest in industry and commerce. They could only take the path of speculation, such as bidding on gold public bonds, which almost became the main business of general banks, which further promoted the great crisis of the banking industry. The most obvious example is the bankruptcy of the Oriental Trust Company, which was completely due to failure in the speculative bidding market. Even the most stable investment, such as real estate, is not reliable. The Tongyi Bank is said to have closed down due to its inability to turn around in real estate investment. The Qianye Association members of the old Guanyuan Character Brand money houses, with strong capital, have closed down in as many as four cases. According to reports, some of them have always made more real estate mortgages. Due to the economic depression, it is difficult to recover the loans, and they have declared liquidation. Therefore, not only is the speculative bidding public bond business not reliable, but also investing in real estate has put banks in misfortune.</p>
<p>In summary, we can see several points, the reasons for the collapse of banks, and at the same time, we understand the current stage of capitalism—from industrial capitalism to financial capitalism—the social relations of production are shackled, and the productive forces are bound to fall into a general collapse.</p>

<p>Sunday Interbank Rate Still at 9%</p>
<p>Jiangnan Auxiliary Currency Continues to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, so collection and settlement were completely suspended. The interbank rate in the market seemed to have become a stereotyped article. The morning and afternoon markets were still at 9%, and there had been no change for many days. The transaction of interbank bills seemed to be active, and it was not slightly inferior due to the bank holiday. It is estimated that more than 2.3 million were transferred in the morning market, more than 600,000 in new transactions, more than 200,000 in transactions in the afternoon market, more than 40,000 in transactions in the Small General Association, more than 16 million in collection and settlement of Yang public bills from money houses, more than 200,000 in remittances from various sources, and nothing else was heard. As for auxiliary currency, Jiangnan small foreign currency continued to fall. The morning market was 828 yuan, originally changed to small 2 yuan, and the afternoon market continued to be small 1 yuan, changed to 827 yuan, so the result fell 3 yuan from the previous day. The transaction volume was 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign currency was 733 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a slight drop of 0.5 jiao from the previous day. The transaction volume was 200,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 331,000 wen, which was still the same as the previous day. The transaction volume was 46,340 strings of wen, totaling 14,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Last Week's Securities Were Weak First and Then Firm</p>
<p>—Only the 23rd Customs 96 Fell Uniquely—</p>
<p>Last week (18th to 23rd) was the last week of the February futures of the Huashang Securities Exchange. Most ordinary bonds were weak first and then strong, with a slight short squeeze. At first, it was said that there would be a huge need for foreign rice imports, and the six-month loans from various houses would expire soon, and the amount was very large. The silver supply in the market was already extremely tight. If this blow were to be suffered again, it would cause a great rift in the financial world. Therefore, various houses have further tightened, and the lending route has been blocked, and people are inevitably panicked. Then, various groups tried to cope, and people gradually calmed down. Because the money houses did not lend, they used floating funds to do arbitrage. There were rumors that the Sino-British gold pound loan was established, so it slightly caused a short squeeze. This is because the short side was crowded during the delivery period. Only the two types of 96 and 23 Customs caused great reactions due to the crowding of the long side. It was not easy to swap 96, and it fell by as much as 3 yuan. When there was no rumor in the environment, it fell by such a large amount, which should be due to the excessive crowding of the long side. The turmoil in the 23rd Customs was no less than the previous week. It rose sharply and fell wildly, doing everything possible to speculate. If you are not careful, no matter whether you are long or short, you will be in a mess. At first, it was rumored that it would be recalled, and the market price was raised wildly again and again. The highest price in February reached more than 82 yuan. Then I heard that a certain bank had settled millions of 23rd Customs mortgages, and the market price once returned slightly. Then there was a rumor that the Russian Boxer Indemnity Certificate was returned to the 23rd Customs collateral pledged to various banks. The recall of the 23rd Customs failed to pass, and the longs came out, and it plummeted. The market price fell wildly by 8.4 yuan in one week, which is a spectacle that has not been seen since the 91 Public Bond. The 23rd Customs is indeed a very beautiful treasury bond, so the market price often maintains its value above 80%, and the amount in circulation outside is still small. After last week, from Monday to Wednesday, ordinary bonds were stable in market price because the delivery period was approaching. There was not much difference. Only the 23rd Customs once rose wildly on Monday, reaching a maximum price of more than 82 yuan, and it seemed to have reached its peak. On Tuesday, because a certain bank settled millions of dollars, 21st sold very vigorously and fell wildly by 2-3 yuan. People were already empty on Wednesday and fell by about 1 yuan again. From Thursday to Saturday, ordinary bonds turned better due to the environment and the delivery was approaching, so there was a slight short squeeze, and they rose slightly every day. The 23rd Customs was the most peaceful on Thursday. Friday was the last day of the February futures, and the strength of the long side also came to light. Various gangs scrambled to come out, and they saw a miserable drop to the limit in the morning. Although trading continued in the afternoon, the decline did not abate. The March futures also almost hit the limit. Although various bonds rose on Saturday, the 23rd Customs still fell wildly by more than 2 yuan. In terms of the market price results for one week, the 23rd Customs fell by a total of 8.34 yuan. Except for 96, which also fell by 2-3 jiao, the rest all rose by 1-2 jiao to 7-8 jiao. The total transaction volume was 122.25 million yuan, and the 23rd Customs accounted for 2.6 million. The increase and decrease results are compared and listed on the left. Today, only March futures are traded for one month, and April futures are allowed to be launched on the 27th. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<p>U.S. Government Bonds Reach a New Peak Again</p>
<p>According to the report of Xinfeng Foreign Firm, yesterday (23rd), the New York stock market stepped down under the leadership of railway stocks. One reason was the bleak profit outlook, and the other reason was the weakness of railway material stocks such as Baur Baldwin and American locomotives. Generally, people's views on public utility stocks are slightly optimistic. In the Baominghan area, Federal Judge Glebb ruled that 14 cities and towns in Alabama were permanently prohibited from borrowing funds from the Public Works Administration to build municipal power plants for the purpose of distributing electricity from the Dennis Valley. Wall Street is also paying close attention to the strength of silver prices. The current New York silver price is 55.375 cents, only 375 cents away from the highest peak since 1929. The London silver price is currently 25 pence 25, which is equal to the highest price since 1929. Part of the reason is that there will be a large import on Thursday. Bond prices rose and fell. U.S. government bonds were very strong and reached a new peak again. Small exchange stocks were sluggish and uneven. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound was firm, and it was volatile compared with the gold standard currency. Half-day turnover was 540,000 shares.</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Export Demand Disappoints</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened, and the market was active. The main transaction was the closing of March long positions, which led to a small price in the distant months, with a drop of 4-7 pounds per sound. Then, due to the weakness of the stock market and disappointing export demand, there were more sellers, and the price continued to soften. The closing price was sluggish, with a drop of 10 pounds per sound for spot goods and a drop of 9-12 pounds per sound for futures. The British cotton market was sluggish, with spot prices rising by 2 points, near-month prices rising by 1 point, and the remaining months unchanged. Indian cotton was initially weak due to the closing of long positions by retail investors and the selling by operators in the market, and then it recovered due to speculative buying. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1.25 Robi, Aomula rose by 0.25 Robi, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.5 Robi. The original telegram recorded the left (telegram on the 22nd).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi flower on the 25th was 248 Robi, an increase of 0.75 Robi compared with the closing price of the previous day.</p>

<p>Rice Market Sales Stagnant and Continue to Fall by 1-2 Jiao</p>
<p>(Hunan, Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were relatively rare, with a total of more than 30 houses arriving (nearly 6,000 stones of goods). However, the sales market continued to be sluggish. Bao Wei had 600 bags from the Tianjin gang. The street was almost stagnant. The prices of thick japonica rice and late rice continued to fall by 1-2 jiao. Although Dujian was in short supply, it was tired due to sluggish sales. The Yinbianyuan was slightly soft by several fen to more than a jiao.</p>
<p>(Hubu, Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 ships from various gangs from Hexia arrived. The ships stored in Hexia were in good condition. Yesterday, the price of Beigeng rice in the market was also less than a jiao, and the price of thin rice was less than 5-6 fen. The middle road was sluggish and did not move, and the price was about 1 jiao short. The price of Yinbianyuan was also close to a jiao. The prices of other goods all showed a downward trend.</p>

<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>National goods year, using national goods, this is the most popular. But after "National Goods Year", "Women's National Goods Year", and "Students' National Goods Year", if there is no more national goods year and everyone is happy to use national goods, that is even more popular.</p>
<p>Speaking of national goods, the problem comes. Native cloth with very coarse and short fibers and simple weaving and dyeing methods is naturally a completely authentic national product. However, recently many farmers have been planting fine and long American cotton. This kind of high-quality cotton wool is used by yarn factories and dyeing and weaving factories opened by Chinese people. The cotton cloth produced is completely similar to imported products. The raw materials for this kind of cotton textile are national goods, the manufacturers are factories opened by Chinese people, and the labor is provided by Chinese people. Although the form is imitation of imported products, this is a completely authentic national product. — I think this kind of improved national product should be vigorously promoted and adopted by everyone. It should never be regarded as a foreign product and destroy the lifeline of improved national products just because it imitates foreign products.</p>
<p>To put it more clearly. For example, a suit. A suit is naturally Western-style, but if it is made of national wool fabrics, I think it should also be promoted. It should never be rejected just because the suit is not Chinese-style. There are many other examples, too numerous to mention. I hope that the gentlemen and ladies who advocate national goods will pay attention to this point. If all commodities that do not preserve the antique style are regarded as non-national goods, then to maintain the status of national goods, they must be as unchangeable as a two-cent zongzi candy, wouldn't that be terrible?</p>

<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>This time I went to the countryside and heard a primary school student crying, which was really sad and moving. Therefore, I have many feelings about "primary school education".</p>
<p>My neighbor, Rongsheng, is ten years old and studies at a ×× primary school in the county. He is smart and lively and can be said to be a top student in the third grade; therefore, every teacher likes him. However, Rongsheng's father is a primary school teacher with a monthly salary of less than 30 yuan. He already feels exhausted trying to support his wife and three sons and two daughters; naturally, there will be problems with the education expenses of his children. Therefore, Rongsheng has been studying at school for five months, and the tuition has not been paid off. The teacher urged him several times, and Rongsheng cried several times in front of his parents; there was really no way, but there was a quarrel in the family.</p>
<p>Last year, during the lunar New Year, Ronger brought a bill back from school. His father saw on the bill: Tuition fee 5 yuan Book fee 1.2 jiao Lecture notes fee 0.6 jiao Tea bag 0.4 jiao Uniform fee 2.4 jiao Craft paper 0.3 jiao Registration fee for the 24th year 1 yuan Total 10.9 jiao</p>
<p>Rongsheng handed the bill to his father and said: The teacher said that if the tuition fee is not paid this time, I will be expelled. As he spoke, tears fell. His father stared at the bill, only dazed, and had nothing else to say. Rongsheng cried, crying very miserably. When I heard such a miserable and sad cry from a child, I felt very sad in my heart, and when I touched my shy pocket, I could only sigh!</p>

<p>Although he didn't know what kind of material it was made of, he could tell that the clothes were soft and fitted to her body, and they were worth money. Her hair, although not like the woman just now, was all curled up, but she didn't comb her hair or braid it. Her black hair was smoothly draped behind her head. At least two-thirds of her arms were exposed, and the rouge on her face was painted as if it were bleeding. She went downstairs in front, and there were three or four men behind her, holding the railings and shouting, Why are you in such a hurry? It doesn't matter if you sit for another ten minutes! If you are hungry, we will ask the waiter to get you something to eat. There are salty ones and sweet ones. Those men just kept begging one after another. The woman smiled faintly on her face, and without looking back, she left on her own. Yueying whispered to Hu: Did you see that? This is not like in the countryside of Gansu. You always have to dress like this for people to like you. Hu nodded, as if to say that her daughter's understanding was right. She had no choice but to sigh and continue walking forward. At this time, there was Zhang Jie夫's voice behind him. He said: Just now, Mr. Cheng Zhiqian told me that there was no Chief Gao at the banquet today, and I believed it. It turns out that Chief Gao left five minutes ago, which has embarrassed me. Yueying turned her head and saw that it was him and Jia Duocai, walking and talking. As soon as Jia Duocai saw him, he squinted his eyes and said "咦". Yueying thought that the other day, because there were foreign devils coming to see him, he told people to leave quickly. This was the same as the woman just now, telling people to go and telling people to get out. Perhaps wealthy people from the East have such a problem. She couldn't help but blush and lowered her head, clinging tightly to her mother. Zhang Jie夫 had already rushed forward a few steps, went around in front of their mother and daughter, blocked the road, and said with a smile: What I said is correct, things haven't been settled, right? I was just talking to Mr. Jia, let's... (141)</p>

<p>— Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After the "Fourth Son Visits His Mother" opera finished that day, the Empress Dowager told me that the eunuch who played She Taijun, the one with the small stature, performed the best and deserved a reward. However, I hadn't paid any attention and just vaguely agreed. Later, I never found out if he received a special reward.</p>
<p>Chapter 23: The Return Journey</p>
<p>After the Empress Dowager's planned trip to Changbai Mountain was canceled by the two officials from the Imperial Astronomical Observatory, a strange illusion filled our minds. This illusion had terrible consequences. Even those who were usually calm and collected gradually became agitated and restless. Some even became timid and fearful, like criminals suffering from a guilty conscience. From morning till night, everyone trembled with fear, hoping to return to Beijing as soon as possible. It was as if some great disaster would befall us if we didn't return immediately. Where did this anxiety come from? No one could say! If it were a nervous breakdown, it wouldn't affect everyone. It must be a shared psychological effect!</p>
<p>Under the influence of this shared psychological effect, we couldn't help but secretly discuss our fears with each other, hiding it from the Empress Dowager. We talked about baseless guesses and ghost stories that frightened ourselves. Finally, someone whispered, "What if there's a big disturbance in the capital in the next few days? Maybe they've already closed the gates of Shanhaiguan, preventing us from entering, and we'll be forced to stay in Fengtian forever!" (252)</p>
<h3 id="e202">Wine is the Joy of the Immortals <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Master Chunyu Lou</p>
<p>Friends who enjoy drinking naturally know that the pleasure in wine is endless. Like the wine immortal Li Bai, who sang in a tavern:</p>
<p>"Three cups lead to the great Dao, a斗 (dou, measurement) unites with nature; just get the fun in wine, don't tell the sober ones."</p>
<p>When Li Guinian heard this song, he said, "This must be Scholar Li!" He hurried upstairs and found Li Bai completely drunk. Guinian stepped forward and said, "The Emperor is waiting at the Agarwood Pavilion! Scholar, go quickly!" Li Bai didn't respond but opened his drunken eyes and recited a poem by Yuanming to Li Guinian: "I am drunk and want to sleep, please go."</p>
<p>After reciting, he fell asleep. Helpless, Li Guinian ordered servants to help him onto a white horse. The crowd helped him all the way to the Five Phoenix Tower. The Emperor then ordered eunuchs to urge him to ride into the palace until he reached the Agarwood Pavilion. The Emperor saw him on horseback with his eyes closed, still not awake. He ordered eunuchs to spread a purple carpet next to the pavilion and helped him off the horse to lie down for a while. The Emperor went to see him and saw saliva flowing from Bai's mouth, so he wiped it with his dragon sleeve. Consort Yang said, "I heard that washing the face with cold water can sober one up." So she ordered the eunuchs to fetch water from the pool to wash his face. Bai woke up, saw the Emperor in front of him, and prostrated himself, saying, "Your subject deserves ten thousand deaths." The Emperor raised him up with his own hand and said, "Today, I am admiring famous flowers with the Consort. We cannot be without new lyrics. Summon the scholar to compose three chapters of Qingping Melody." Bai saw that the writing instruments were all there, so he composed it while drunk in one stroke.</p>
<p>It can be seen that for those who are good at drinking, wine can also help literary inspiration. Those who are not good at drinking naturally do not know the joy of it. Therefore, modern wanderers often use wine to relieve sorrow, which can be described as "one drunk and all things are over." Indeed, wine is the joy of the immortals. Friends who are shrouded in clouds of sorrow, drink as much as you can!</p>

<p>Confucius's moral ethics and political philosophy have dominated Chinese society for two thousand years, so he can be considered a man of great achievement. Yu the Great dredged many of the rivers of the Yangtze and Huai during the era of great floods and can also be considered a man of great achievement.</p>
<p>However, there is not a single bronze statue for us to look up to, which must be considered a shameful and regrettable thing.</p>
<p>Chinese culture is not a culture of stone carvings, not a culture of iron castings. Chinese culture is a culture of bamboo books recording the years, a culture of continuous ink marks, not a hard culture, a soft culture, not a rigid culture, a gentle culture.</p>

<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Although new and improved forms often have a retro feel, clothing, which is used to keep warm and adorn the body, has undergone countless ingenious designs and inventions by predecessors. Sometimes, ignoring the rule that "if the clothes do not fit properly, there will be disaster," it has its own special charm in the past that is worth talking about.</p>
<p>Jie Shan (Pieced Robe)…This is a long robe made by joining two different fabrics of two different colors near the waist. The material can be different, as long as they are similar. For example, the upper half is crepe, the lower half is spun silk, the upper half has large flowers, and the lower half has small flowers or no flowers. The value of the materials and the coordination of colors are the conditions for a beautiful jie shan. In the past, upper-class people valued the magua (mandarin jacket) more than people do now. Adding a magua to a long robe was considered a sign of respect and solemnity. People who went out or visited guests mostly wore a magua, covering the upper half of the jie shan, so the material of the upper half of the jie shan could be a little more casual.</p>
<p>Tao Ku (Over-pants)…This is a pair of custom-made trouser legs with no crotch or waistband, used to be worn over pants. The function of the tao ku is twofold: to increase warmth in the lower body and to add beauty, while using less valuable material. Its lower section is the same as ordinary trouser legs, and the upper section is cut into an oblique angle at the knee bend, lower in the back and higher in the front - the lower back is for ease of bending the knees and legs when moving, and the higher front is so that the tips of the high part can be affixed with two straps for attachment to the belt. Tao ku can be single-layered, lined, or cotton-padded. Many men in Jiangnan have them, and in Jiangbei, they are used by both men and women. As times advance, the youths of Jiangnan generously give this thing to the elderly as their patent!</p>
<p>Jia Xiu (False Sleeves), Chen Ling (False Collar)…There are two types of false sleeves: one is a single-layered lining attached to the cuffs of short or long shirts to protect the original sleeves from getting dirty or torn, incidentally making people suspect that it is the cuff of another piece of clothing; the other is an independent sleeve that is not as long as the elbow, made of valuable material, and its sole purpose is to show off wealth, forming "the divine dragon sees its head but not its tail." There are also those made of coarse material with lining or cotton padding, which is very practical for keeping warm, but inevitably shows people that there is one more piece of clothing inside. The latter type of false sleeve has a row of buttons near the opening to prevent it from falling off, defeating its purpose. The chen ling (false collar) has the same function as the false sleeves, with a little more material under the collar, folded together in a pointed shape in front of the chest, and also fitted with a row of buttons. These two small items are worn by brokers when they go to visit guests.</p>

<h3 id="e205">From the Strange Incident at Tangqiao to Breaking Superstition <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, a ridiculous and outrageous incident occurred in Tangqiao, Hedong. A group of local ruffians, in order to promote a temple fair in the countryside, went to the Tiantian Temple in the eastern town of the village on the night of the Lantern Festival and carried out the small statue of the Zhaotianhou deity enshrined in the temple. A large crowd quickly gathered and went to a nearby public cemetery to perform "pao tan" (running the altar) and "jiao tang" (calling the hall). They cracked open the coffins of newly deceased unclaimed bodies on the tombs and forcibly removed the dead people's heads, hanging them on the chair of the small deity. It is said that they held the same event again the night before.</p>
<p>This behavior of the ignorant and foolish people of Tangqiao is certainly bizarre and inhumane. However, the behaviors that contributed to this bizarre and inhumane act are of a superstitious mindset. Therefore, we cannot just look at it as bizarre or inhumane.</p>
<p>The superstitious minds of the Chinese villagers are still deeply rooted, influenced by historical traditional thoughts. For example, the reason why the villagers hold temple fairs is not simply for the sake of having fun, but because they believe that holding temple fairs will bring peace to the area. We only need to look at a village holding a temple fair when there is a bad harvest or an epidemic to understand their purpose for holding the temple fair. The meaning of the Tangqiao event is undoubtedly the same. It's just that their actions are slightly bizarre and inhumane.</p>
<p>Eliminating the superstitious minds of the Chinese people cannot be achieved simply by slogans or signs like "Down with superstition." Because slogans are equal to empty talk and can at best wake people's ears and eyes for a moment. Even using pressure to prohibit it is futile. Forcing people to get rid of superstition will be like forcing people to switch to the national calendar. People can obey in appearance but disobey in their hearts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best way to eliminate the superstitious minds of the people is to work hard on education. It must be known that the cultivation of superstition has a long history and cannot be completely eliminated overnight. We should use educational methods to vigorously instill scientific knowledge into the general public, explaining the pros and cons of superstition, so that the people can realize the necessity of eliminating superstition themselves. In this way, the people's superstitious minds will gradually be improved and eliminated.</p>
<p>There is another point that those engaged in breaking superstition must pay attention to. That is, the villagers' holding of temple fairs contains a recreational function in addition to asking for peace and tranquility in the area. Because Chinese villages have always lacked recreational venues. A group of villagers work hard all year round and cannot get a chance to enjoy themselves. For the sake of physical and mental relaxation, they have to take advantage of the temple fairs to have fun for a while. Therefore, if we want the Chinese people to eliminate superstitious minds, we should set up more recreational venues in the villages and hold various exhibitions several times a year, so that the villagers can increase their knowledge and get proper recreational opportunities. In this way, the superstitious behavior of holding temple fairs in the countryside will fall without being overthrown.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Twilight <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>This year's spring will no longer have green tones; in the cold rain and snow, it appears with the brown posture of late autumn.</p>
<p>And the world of this spring is also hanging up a gray-yellow curtain.</p>
<p>— Is it the accumulation of the years, or is it the drop in the mercury column on the thermometer? Even in spring, I have the mood of a wilting autumn sunflower.</p>
<p>The tone is one of desolation and indifference. The heart is as barren as a small courtyard in late autumn with fallen leaves dancing.</p>
<p>Even if I have good intentions toward the migratory birds with clipped tails traveling to the south, what I get is still as terrible as a dying candle and the desolation of the Middle Ages on the branches of plum blossoms.</p>
<p>From this, I began to understand that age has pulled people to the edge of an unknowable cave: and people are no longer children suitable for a bright season.</p>
<p>(The world always belongs to the new, the younger generation; and you, who have hung up the dark curtain of twilight, what else is more suitable for you to miss other than some endless late autumn evenings?)</p>
<p>It's really hard to believe even myself: Could it be that the historical facts of a bloody life for many years represent this endless string of late autumn evenings? Ha, God knows where the key to this magic of life lies!</p>
<p>However, a soul that grows in stubbornness will not willingly be dissolved in the unfair twilight. Although in mornings and evenings, people may be occupied by a withered terror, a twilight desolation is vaguely reflected in front of me, like a dream, like smoke. So, I comprehend a small scene of a desert sunset: a group of camels crawling hard, like snails on the damp corners of walls, and the north wind blowing out the cold metallic sound. The travelers ask for grass and clear water, but finally fall horizontally in the endless sea of sand. A gust of wind deeply buries them into the strata—the sun on the horizon is gray and black.</p>
<p>My heart trembled in cold sweat: Did I really have a twilight mood? And I, I grew up in stubbornness!</p>
<p>So, I chose a bright morning, picked up a copy of Schopenhauer's "Studies in Pessimism", grabbed a chair, and sat in the strong sun in the courtyard.</p>
<p>What I hope for is: maybe there will be a young mood as bright as the sun?</p>
<p>The tone of twilight has no reason to grow in the sun.</p>
<p>But, strangely, when the sun shines golden flowers between the pages of the book, the venomous snake of old age that makes people tremble also awakens. The speed of imagery is unimaginable, and at the same time, it cannot be calculated with mathematical equations: in the warm courtyard's sunlight, an old man's loneliness begins to break into the lawn of barren ideas again. I remembered the old man in "Rip Van Winkle".</p>
<p>(Isn't there also so much dreamlike sorrow of old people in the sun of the big meadow?)</p>
<p>The warmth, laughter, blue romance, and brown suffering of the past conjure up seven-colored shadows in the sun. Then tears also float on the wrinkled face, dripping and resting on the trembling pale lips, like ice crystals on withered leaves in winter.</p>
<p>In the burning of tobacco leaves, in the movement of the sun, the tragedy of life appears endlessly once again, and this old man who pursues warmth and moves with the sun, isn't he delightfully regarded as a sundial?</p>
<p>And this sundial not only indicates the time but also indicates the way out of life.</p>
<p>I understand that the sorrow of twilight is pressing on people's hearts, and there is no way to escape it: when life reaches a gray stage, there is no way to disguise it even in the sun!</p>
<p>So I calmed down: the sorrow of twilight is a more stubborn venomous snake than me, which cannot be avoided in the world.</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Many single friends envy me for having a home, and I used to envy others this way when I was single. Every day, I dragged my tired body back from the office, thinking that my wife would greet me with a smiling face at the door, take off my coat for me, and present me with a freshly brewed cup of Longjing tea. Smoking cigarettes like this, or sharing the candies I brought back: naturally, it is incomparable to the lonely sleep in the center of the bed when I was single. Sometimes, when going out, I made an appointment in advance! As soon as the doorbell rang, my wife, dressed in new clothes, had already jumped in front of me, knowingly took my arm, and rushed to the 5:30 movie. The fatigue of the day was imperceptibly reaped from the wife's charming laughter and whispers. If there is an innocent little baby who throws himself from his wife's arms while learning to speak, and you want him to call out "Dad," that kind of</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>pleasure is enough for single men to envy endlessly.</p>
<p>From envying others, I was envied by others. I spent three years living a "home" life like heaven. There is a charming child running and jumping on the ground, and everything is maintaining the same situation as when the home started, but I feel that home is not as lovely as it used to be! This is naturally incomprehensible to single friends.</p>
<p>A good friend sent a letter from a distant place. He got married. He told me so proudly: From today on, he is a person with a home. My own experience may not be a model for every home. I read that letter with contrary eyes to his overly happy tone. In the reply, I said: Home is heaven. We can get happiness from her that we have never enjoyed before. At the same time, home is also an invisible chain. It makes us suffer from the pain we have never experienced! The old friend who is in honeymoon may be aroused to be dissatisfied. He should be happy at the time he is contentedly with a home he has been yearning for long, but he will gradually understand the reason for this sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Decline of the Paper Sheep <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Taku Ren</p>
<p>Children always look forward to celebrating the New Year and festivals. Whenever there are New Year or festivals, they will happily smile. After eating the tangyuan of the Winter Solstice, they will want to get the "lucky money" of the New Year's Eve, and after the New Year, they will look forward to playing with lanterns on the fifteenth night of the Lantern Festival. Therefore, children are as clear about remembering the New Year and festivals as the housewives in the family.</p>
<p>When I was a child, although my family worshiped Christianity, we were as lively as other families every New Year and festival, with food and fun. Therefore, I still remember some programs clearly. I was especially interested in the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>The Lantern Festival, according to the customs there, is the liveliest day of the year in all events. Children especially are even happier. Both the county and the countryside perform community operas starting from the twelfth or thirteenth. On the fourteenth, there will be a big celebration of welcoming the gods, which will continue until the seventeenth or eighteenth. Therefore, children can have extra fun during this event.</p>
<p>Children, no matter how poor their families are, all carry or pull many paper carp, paper sheep, paper gold coins, and other paper lanterns on the fourteenth night. The children in a community or village all compete with paper lanterns in groups on this night. Whose is made well, whose is made novel, special, or large, the results will be determined on this night. On the fifteenth night, everyone arranges according to the results of the competition, setting off rockets, firecrackers, and firecrackers, and they will continue to have fun until late at night before going home.</p>
<p>It seems that I was only ten years old at that time. My brother specially made a very large paper sheep for me. The result of the competition on the fourteenth night was the first. The happiness at that time was really more exciting than anything else. The children all called me "Big Brother."</p>
<p>From this year on, I have never been back to my hometown for the Lantern Festival. I have also gradually grown older, and I have lost the interest I had in paper sheep when I was a child.</p>
<p>The last time I returned to my hometown, recalling the childhood situation at that time, I was also happy. On the fifteenth night, I went with my brothers to watch community operas and the lantern festival of the children in each community. This night made me feel disappointed. The community operas were not as lively as before. The children's lantern festival was not as spectacular as it used to be. The welcoming of the gods was also very deserted without much excitement.</p>
<p>It has been three years since I have celebrated the Lantern Festival. If I hadn't seen the children pulling paper sheep tonight, I would have almost forgotten the festival that I used to have the most fun with as a child.</p>
<p>The Lantern Festival used to be such a lively day. It has been the same for thousands of years, but in recent years, it has become a situation of deteriorating day by day, just like the life of me, this wanderer. Just walking into the apartment, seeing the very sparse children pulling paper sheep and setting off firecrackers, I couldn't help but think of the grand occasion of the competition of paper sheep, paper carp, paper gold coins, etc., in my childhood. Although that time was not as good as before, three years ago was not as good as that year, but now, it is even worse than the Lantern Festival night I saw three years ago.</p>
<p>Wandering is wandering day by day, and people are getting older day by day. The scene in front of me is also changing rapidly, and this Lantern Festival is becoming more and more indifferent generation after generation.</p>
<p>Everything is in a recession, and even the Lantern Festival, which is a night without sleep for children, is in a recession. We are considered to have enjoyed the blessing of playing, but it is sad that the children are sinking into a recession year after year.</p>

<p>— Wei Jin</p>
<p>They already quarreled last night. In Xinmin's case, he suffered a bellyful of anger from the outside, thinking that only his wife understood him, and told his wife to calm his anger, but when he came home, his wife opened her mouth and added fuel to the fire, making him even more angry.</p>
<p>His wife said, "Going out for a day and not finding a single penny, it would be better for me to go." He listened to an unknown fire rising ten feet high, "It would be better for you to go? Then why don't you go?" He had never spoken to his wife in such a fierce and loud voice. This time, he broke the rule. His wife couldn't bear it, of course, and felt insulted. The more she thought about it, the more sad she became. Why are you so fierce to me? I only said that one sentence. Can't we talk calmly? His wife began to cry. With crying and speaking, she said, "Why don't I go? …Isn't it because I want to save face for you? Can't I open my mouth to borrow money from people? We've only been married for a short time, and I'm already running around to borrow money from people. Wouldn't people laugh at me? It doesn't matter if I'm ridiculed, it doesn't matter… Where did your face hide? …Why don't I go? Don't I want to go? Have I ever said that I don't want to go? …"</p>
<p>Originally, he was angry, but after his wife cried, it was his wife who was angry instead of him. He felt that he had said too much and shouldn't have. His wife had a reason, and he shouldn't have made his wife feel wronged and sad. He not only didn't get angry but felt ashamed, feeling sorry for his wife. He wanted to change his attitude and explain to his wife in a more gentle manner, but at the same time, he felt that this was not possible—he would give in to her as soon as she cried and made a fuss, and this trend must not be allowed to continue, as the days of cohabitation are still long. However, if he didn't explain to his wife in a gentle manner, his wife would naturally not give in, and this would also make the current situation impossible to resolve. He felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart, and the flames of pain were burning his entire soul.—He took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and smoked it. His mouth was blowing smoke, his eyes staring out the window, and his brows were tightly furrowed. He showed a melancholy expression.</p>
<p>His wife never cried or made a fuss, and this time she also broke the rule. She sat on the bed and cried for a while. Seeing that he didn't talk back but stared out the window to smoke, showing a melancholy expression, she knew that he was not angry but sad. He was angry with me today because he couldn't borrow money. He hadn't been angry before. He must have been angry outside. You gave him anger when he already received other people's anger, aren't you understanding him? You shouldn't give him comfort, and you want to make him angry? …It's really wrong. Now that he is made uncomfortable and melancholy, it is really a sin. His wife was regretting, not crying but sad, she silently watched tears flow.</p>
<p>He smoked for a while, in melancholy and sadness, and suddenly didn't hear his wife's crying and talking. He looked back and saw his wife crying sadly. He felt that he had never been angry with his wife before, and had never made his wife cry sadly. This time, his actions were too cruel. He left the window, ran to the bed, and wanted to explain to his wife, but as soon as he sat down next to his wife, his wife burst into tears and fell into his arms…</p>
<h3 id="e211">Adventure in Difficulty <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>What causes the most suffering for countless young people now is the difficulty in solving the problems of seeking education and seeking employment. Seeking education is the first hurdle, and seeking employment is the second hurdle. The second hurdle is actually even more difficult than the first. Indeed, with the bankruptcy of all industries in our country and a surplus of manpower, young people seeking employment see society as an impenetrable wall, with no way to find an outlet. They often end up on detours they originally did not want to take. This phenomenon makes one deeply feel the seriousness of the situation, which conceals the endless difficulties and dangers in the future of young people.</p>
<p>There are two ways to remedy this serious situation: first, we must use a spirit of great fearlessness to break down the copper wall of society; second, we must work hard to move forward and create new careers for the future. Do not be afraid of difficulties, do not be afraid of dangers, as long as you take the risk, follow the plan, and move forward towards the goal, you can overcome those difficulties and dangers.</p>
<p>So-called adventure seems the same as recklessness, but they are actually different. A reckless person has no goal, no plan, and is like a blind man riding a blind horse, blundering forward in confusion. Adventure is not like that. First, there is a clear goal and a well-thought-out plan, and then one moves forward towards the goal according to the plan. The so-called "danger" refers to the difficulties encountered on the way forward. The so-called adventure means using a spirit of great fearlessness to overcome difficulties in order to implement the plan and achieve the goal. Those who have a goal, a plan, and are not afraid of danger have already clearly known that this goal and this plan require overcoming this difficulty. They only strive to devise ways to cope with it, and have no intention of panicking or retreating. Therefore, there is a lasting spirit of great fearlessness, which is not a temporary emotional impulse, but the result of a rational and insightful understanding.</p>

Faintly, the sound of the oriole is already slanting with the sun. It's not that she doesn't respect the rules of the boudoir, but she's just shy and familiar with the family. Only because of the evil bandit soldier Sun Longhu, thousands of people surrounded and made noise, wanting to forcibly snatch the slave away, encircling the forest and thoroughly searching. My dear mother personally promised the marriage, but now the marriage is relied upon without end. It harms him in the West Chamber, thinking about the situation, the sin is on me. The slave heard Hong Niang persuade her that she should send a cup of tea when asking about the illness. Tonight, the slave will ask him.</p>

But seeing its Guanghan Palace closed, its bright light dimmed, the world is over in thirty days. The moonlight is faint and evokes homesickness. The hometown is thousands of miles away, separated by mountains and rivers, wanting to send a family letter to the distant swan. Pitiful, the cold quilt is lonely, the moonlight shines, sighing endlessly, the melancholy has no place to go. Fragrant mist and cloudy hair wet tonight, idly leaning against the jade railing in boredom. Moonlight fills the couch with worries, moonlight is clear and gentle, remembering distant traces. The ends of the earth are separated, crying in the boudoir, tears are red. I don't know when the good man will be seen, the night scene is bleak, meeting under the moon and asking why he is rushing. He is seeking food and clothing on the road. Therefore, he does not distinguish between day and night, and earns money to cure poverty. The whole family can live together, so he is traveling long distances to seek grain. The hometown is often separated for three autumns, the moon returns to the world several times. Since traveling year after year, the years of reunion are in the guest house. Alas, the world is like a tumbleweed.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Hollywood's Special School that Emphasizes the Three Aspects of Education and Simultaneously Imparts Intellectual Power (Part 1) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiabo</p>
<p>Hollywood has a special school called the Carl Gurtis School for Boys and Girls. The educational policy there does not advocate any particular system, but the purity of its purpose, the perfection of its methods, and the excellence of its achievements are indeed worthy of attention by educators in general. Therefore, we will record all of its contents below in detail for the reference of those who are concerned.</p>
<p>That school is located between Culver City and Hollywood, on a grand scale. It is a place where the children of Hollywood movie stars receive knowledge, temper their muscles and bones, and cultivate their morals. That school is not an ordinary school, but a place that every child, regardless of gender, dreams of every day. There, swimming and boxing are also part of the curriculum. Outdoor sports occupy the same important position as English and arithmetic.</p>
<p>Almost ten years ago, Hollywood's famous director Cecil B. DeMille and other big stars, such as Jack Holt, Will Rogers, and Noah Beery, planned to establish a school with the late physical education expert Carl Gurtis and educator Brabant, to develop children's physical and mental strength in parallel. They greatly agreed with that plan and first sent their own children to the school they founded. This is the beginning of the current Carl Gurtis School.</p>
<p>In smaller cities, or those with established scales, almost no one dares to propose the establishment of such a reformist school. But in Hollywood, which was in its early stages of development at that time, they felt that this plan was very much in line with theory, so they proceeded without hesitation. Sure enough, after only one year, the students' parents were amazed by their children's achievements.</p>
<p>In that school, even kindergarten students practice swimming. When they enter elementary school, they are taught foreign literature. Physical defects can be corrected by exercise. A temperament that is just and gloomy can be transformed into kindness and happiness. The increase in weight, general health, and mental agility of each child are all considered to be remarkable achievements, which has led many movie stars who are parents to send their children to that special school. Even powerful families who do not work in the film industry want to send their children there. However, due to limitations in location and equipment, the school authorities have maintained the original enrollment of eighty students.</p>
<p>The faith and praise of Hollywood film industry figures for the school can be proven by the words of Clive Brook. Clive Brook's daughter Faith and his son Clive Jr. both attend that school. He said: "The best lessons these two children get there. But good lessons are available in other schools as well. What I approve of as a special feature of this school is that it gives every child the physical skills that make them grow up without being attacked by disease and losing or diminishing the joy of life. They not only educate children's minds but also train their muscles and bones. If a little child knows how to swim, ride a horse, skate, play tennis, and play golf, they will have fewer opportunities to feel lonely or uneasy in the future."</p>
<p>Clive is right. If a person's body and mind have been trained in the same way, his life will be very balanced and full of interest.</p>
<p>That is the firm theory of the current principal, Brabant, the ideal that more than a dozen teachers at Carl Gurtis School share, and what has been tested and proven by major educators for more than a decade, that increasing children's physical strength can greatly promote the development of knowledge. Brabant is able to confirm this ideal with student records, because 80% of the students at Carl Gurtis School who go on to ordinary elementary or secondary schools are able to advance one to three grades in each subject.</p>
<p>Now, let us describe the general situation of an ideal student from the admission procedure to the initial training at the school. For example, let's say the student's name is Jimmy. His mother is a female star. This five-year-old Jimmy is the treasure in his mother's eyes, more precious than a contract with a company. One day, she took Jimmy to see Principal Brabant. She received a plain reception from the school authorities, as if they didn't know she was a very popular female star, which made her a little angry.</p>
<p>If the eighty student slots have not yet been filled, she will receive a blank certificate to check her physical condition, and her husband will be asked to have her family doctor fill it out item by item and submit it within two or three days, along with knowledge and psychological tests. And if she doesn't mind the plain reception from the school authorities after she goes back, which is usually not the case, she will definitely bring Jimmy back to that school again in two or three days. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e218">Germany to Convene International Film Conference in Late April <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The Soviet Film Association initiated an international film exhibition in Moscow in February of this year, and invited film industries in the Far East, Europe, and the Americas to send representatives and selected works to participate in the exhibition. After receiving the invitation from the Soviet authorities, our country collected representative works from major companies and sent them for exhibition. Those who went to participate from the Shanghai film industry included Zhou Jianyun, manager of the Mingxing Company, and movie star Hu Die.</p>
<p>According to a Berlin telegraphic dispatch on February 21, the German government also intends to convene an international film conference of the same nature in Berlin in late April, and has telegraphed various European, American, and Far Eastern countries that produce and show films, inviting them to participate. The invitation has been issued by the German Central Film Bureau, and the dates are set from April 25 to May 1.</p>
<p>According to news released by the German Film Bureau, the number of representatives dispatched by various countries, not including the national representatives, is approximately 800. In addition, if we add the national representatives, such as the representatives of the annual meeting of the German National Film Association, etc., then the gathering of global film industry celebrities, experts, and movie stars in Berlin will exceed 1,500, which can be said to be a grand occasion, perhaps exceeding the Soviet film exhibition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the representatives from distant countries who have gone to Moscow to participate in the Soviet Union's international film exhibition will tour major scenic spots in Western Europe and the West after the closing of the exhibition, and then attend the World Film Conference in Berlin in late April, which will be a win-win situation and will not cost much.</p>
<p>It is not the first time that Germany has convened an international film conference. The last World Film Conference was also convened by Germany, held in Berlin in 1928.</p>

<p>The most dashing and elegant leading man, Robert Montgomery, has consistently maintained his graceful, generous, and relaxed strengths since his performances in "The Anonymous Mr.," "Forsaking All Others," and most recently, "The Last of Mrs. Cheyney." However, Robert will lose his love twice in his latest work, "The Old Testament and the New Covenant," due to his optimistic personality. But this is a story for later, so let's not mention it for now. Now, "The Diary of a Virgin," which is currently being screened in "Nanjing," features Robert Montgomery and the talented Anne Harding in a second collaboration. "The Diary of a Virgin" is the most popular work in the life of the American playwright N.S. Behman. It was performed continuously for eight months in the Broadway Theatre in New York, which shows its great appeal. If we observe the attitude of the American newspapers' comments, we should also have the idea that it is difficult to have another good play, and at the same time, it is also enough to prove its value on the screen. The following are some of the American newspapers' comments:</p>
<p>New York American—"The Diary of a Virgin" is really more than just a wonderful play. Of course, it is one of the most successful and least numerous works of this year.</p>
<p>New York Times—This is truly Behman's most mature masterpiece declaring human nature. It is as lofty as the sky and as deep as the sea.</p>
<p>Daily News—Although "The Diary of a Virgin" is a complicated comedy, the individual personalities of the characters in the play have been vividly portrayed by Behman, making it an interesting and wonderful product. Undoubtedly, it should be listed as a "must-see."</p>
<p>New York Evening Post—Writing with a pen, it is very insightful. Behman's observation of all kinds of life here can be said to be exploring the subtleties.</p>
<p>World-Telegram—For this "Diary," I can only use two words to criticize it. Those are "adult" and "temptation." (The meaning of these two words is particularly ambiguous)</p>
<h3 id="e220">Anna Sten's Husband Who Will Also Devote Himself to the Screen <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>It is said that Anna Sten's husband, Dr. Eugene Frenke, will become a new film artist in Hollywood in the near future.</p>
<p>The wife of this Russian movie star, Falek, was an architect in Russia, so apart from doing a little film script with his wife after coming to Hollywood, it can be said that he has no experience in the film industry at all. But he always wanted to do something in the film industry, and he finally did it.</p>
<p>He wanted to be a director himself, but he had no experience, so naturally no producer was willing to give him a chance to try. Therefore, he began to look for a very attractive story. It just so happened that at that time, Dr. Cornish, a famous scientist in California, succeeded in reviving a dead dog.</p>
<p>This is what Falek needed. Wouldn't it be extremely appealing to film this wonder of the new era? So he began to write an interesting film script about this great discovery. Then he obtained permission from Dr. Cornish to borrow the film of his experimental results when filming in the future.</p>
<p>After everything was done, he went to Lamel, the boss of Universal Company, to discuss filming this film. Lamel agreed to him, but stipulated that the film could only be produced at a very low cost.</p>
<p>This film, "Life Returns," has now been completed. At the same time, Falek also proved that he did have extraordinary directing talent. Although it only took eleven days and there were no big stars in the cast, people who have seen it said that "Life Returns" is a rare and interesting film recently.</p>
<p>Falek said to reporters in a confident tone: "Now I can work in the film industry with my wife. We often work together very well and with a lot of understanding. So I believe we will definitely be able to do something meaningful in Hollywood."</p>

<p>An American production by Ai Kai Hua Lei Dian Hua Company, starring Mei Lao Bo Xun</p>
<p>Some people go through life without ever knowing the meaning of the word "failure." This trait is possessed by Miss Lulan Beiersifu. However, Lulan Beiersifu's struggle is not for herself, but for her many young students. Lulan Beiersifu has been the principal of the Municipal Middle School in Afang Tai'er for twenty-eight years. Although she feels physically and mentally exhausted after these long years, she secretly finds solace in reminiscing about her past achievements. She herself can't recall how many times she made up her mind to fight for her "children," for their physical, intellectual, and moral well-being, for their right to choose their own entertainment, and for the foundation of their future lives.</p>
<p>She is now alone, sitting at her desk in the principal's office, pondering a new struggle that has recently arisen. She is not a fool. She knows that her opponents are combining forces to deal with her personally. She knows that regardless of the outcome of this struggle, she will pay an immense price. She knows that she has no other path to choose. Her weary eyes—her intelligent, kind, and understanding eyes—unconsciously focused on a wooden plaque hanging on the wall. It was a gift from the graduating class of 1906, with a line branded on it: "Do what is right—that is courage."</p>
<p>Looking at it, she couldn't help but feel a surge of joy. Courage... righteousness... indeed, she possessed both of these qualities. Let it be whatever Joseph Jielai, the most powerful man in the area, rich with money and the owner of a newspaper in Afang Tai'er, may say. She knew that his inexhaustible wealth had many dishonest and incomplete sources. She knew why Kelalunsi Daide, the gambling den of Kelike Daide, could remain open permanently. She knew that there were many sycophants in the area, echoers who agreed to everything, and many local "political thugs" who wanted to lick sores and suck pus, hoping to get a share of the leftovers. Thinking about this, she frequently shook her head. She bit her own lip. Even the local school inspector, Helunte, came to her personally to warn her not to be too enthusiastic and to use some "diplomatic means."</p>
<p>Helunte said to her, "Miss Beiersi, in any case, Daide has already invested a lot..." Beiersi immediately retorted, "Invested? It seems to me that it is a harm to the area, the creation of evil forces. Daide's gambling den is not a place for my children to gather." Helunte narrowed his eyes into slits, looking at her maliciously, and asked, "What evidence do you have?" Miss Beiersi glared and said, "I have no evidence. But as long as I am alive, I will find it one day!"</p>
<p>Indeed, she had obtained evidence... She sighed softly, thinking of... but not complaining about the price she had paid and the failures she had experienced. She clenched her teeth and made up her mind to achieve the final victory. Why were they so foolish? They didn't know that what she cared about most was Jili Jielai, the orphaned daughter of Joseph Jielai. Jili was a senior in high school, beautiful in appearance but spoiled and headstrong, and always a leader among her classmates. Jili thought that going to Daide's place was a bold and interesting thing to do. There was an ice cream counter there, which seemed perfectly harmless on the outside. But behind the ice cream counter, there was a "back room," where Kelike Daide sold special drinks. Daide also lured a group of young people into gambling.</p>
<p>One day, Miss Beiersi wanted to reason with Daide herself. He had once been her student. But now Daide knew that he had a protective charm and was not afraid of what an old woman could do. He laughed at her. But he still liked her. Everyone couldn't help but like her. But now, Miss Beiersi saw Daide's arrogance and knew that her authority as principal no longer reached this former student. She had no other choice but to fight him. (To be continued)</p>
