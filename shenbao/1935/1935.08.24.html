<p>（倫敦）華盛頓所宣佈一九三五年棉產每磅借欵九分二辦法、為利物浦與倫敦人士所歡迎、美國棉農今後可由尋常商業途徑推銷其棉、而由政府彌補其售價、以一角二分為度、此舉應可使現有棉花所有之緊張為之鬆動、而導成更廣大之交易、美棉出口之可能性、亦將因此大增、蓋在過去棉季中美棉常處於莫可購買之地位、但今後美國可在比較的無限制之基礎上與他國競爭矣紐約經紀人預料棉市開盤將低落六十至七十磅音、而十月期超過五月期之差價亦將縮小、市塲中人前因棉花化參議員之樂觀的預料而購進之期貨或將脫售、棉派議員大為不滿、因棉農前有一角二分之借欵、外加二分半之利益金、今則僅有一角二分之担保、而利益亦包括在內也、利物浦棉市近期較遠期為弱、但了結雖多皆被吸收、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國下屆總選舉之前瞻</h3>
<p>— 緯</p>
<p>英國自上次總選。迄於今日。四年之期。倏焉將至。下屆總選。據最近電訊傳來。已定於本年十月舉行。英國左右各黨。均爲選舉競爭。大事活動。此次競選。在保守黨方面。實早已從事準備。六月間國民內閣二次改組。保守黨領袖包爾溫之代麥唐納爲首相。卽爲整飭陣容。統一戰綫。以增競選實力計耳。蓋自一九三一年以來。麥氏雖投入保守黨之懷抱。盡其安定金鎊。挽回預算平衡之任務。然而其政治上之設施。殊不能盡如人意。在野敵黨。對彼固極端非難。卽政界及黨中之極端保守派。亦加以排擠。麥氏在此左右夾攻中。聲譽日隳。威望旣不足爲號召之資。政策又多爲人所指摘。去歲倫敦市議會之選舉。工黨竟獲空前勝利。可覘人心之向背。保守黨人爲未雨綢繆起見。自不得不嚴陣以待。首揆一席遂舍包爾溫莫屬矣。包氏自任首揆。麥氏置諸閒曹之樞密院長。西門調任內相。國民內閣。名義猶是也。而實質今非矣。前此之內閣。猶稍具一致之精神。今則置保守黨重要人物於內閣之最前綫。使政權全入保守黨掌握。此其意義無他。便於與反對黨搏戰而已。下屆大選中。國民工黨與自由黨西門派之沒落。殆可預下。保守黨之排除麥唐納與西門。勢所難免。然則保守黨曷爲仍以國民內閣之陣容而出現於下屆選舉哉。推其原因。實欲在競選中吸收黨外選民票數。以博得絕對勝利。故爲增加西門派自由黨及國民工黨候選人計。卽令若干保守黨候選人。放棄候選。亦所不惜。目前保守黨有政治上之優勢。爲其利用。有雄厚之財力。資其活動。有兩小黨作其羽翼。有恢復景氣政策爲其號召。其陣勢固不弱也。</p>
<p>在總選中可與保守黨相角逐者。惟在野黨重鎭之工黨耳。工黨近三年來。無處不作捲士重來之計劃。雖工黨領袖。如藍斯堡。如漢德森。稍嫌缺乏威望。不足號召。然左派同盟苟能成立。以號稱威爾士魔術家之前首相路德喬治爲其首魁。以新政綱領爲競選號召之資。則左野聯合政黨之陣容。亦極雄厚。下屆大選中。鹿死誰手。正未可知。所不可知者惟路德喬治之主張。能否得工黨一致之贊助耳。路德喬治雖得右派工黨之贊助。然其主張。在左派工黨猶認爲對工人有不利傾向。且路氏在下屆選舉中。旣以其新政爲競選政綱。聯合左派爲其與黨。則大選勝利。必仍以聯合內閣形式出現。而自任首揆。此種主張。能否爲工黨贊同。目前尙屬疑問。苟左派同盟不能成立。就目前形勢觀之。恐在野之工黨。亦難操勝算耳。</p>
<h3>對意阿爭案　英法密切合作　英閣决議通知法政府　恪守國聯盟約下義務　藉外交談判挽回戰禍　軍火禁令暫予以維持</h3>
<p>（倫敦）內閣討論怠阿爭案之會議、歷五小時、而於午後四時三十分散會、諸閣員離唐寗街相邸時、門外羣衆皆予以誠摯之敬禮、堂璽大臣麥唐納曰、「吾人已悄然靜然冷然决定主張、吾人對於所應做之事、頭腦甚淸、」其餘閣員均謝絕作何評論、關於會議情形、未如預料發表正式文吿、據負責方面消息、不管部閣員艾登曾詳細報告巴黎三國會議之經過情形、然後內閣乃考慮與案有關之各種問題、</p>
<p>內閣極贊成英法政府在巴黎之决議、卽兩國仍恒相接觸、密切合作、一面與意國探討覓取和平解决之可能性、以待九月四日國聯行政院會議之召集、爲作此探討起見、七月間所作暫禁發給輸往意阿兩國軍火執照之决議、目前不加變更、此並非以爲此項决議必須維持至九月四日也、並議决英政府對國聯與盟約所持之態度、其政策曾經屢次宣布、今無變更之理由、關於此節、內閣曾引述外相霍爾七月三十一日在下院所發「吾人深知一切條約與國聯盟約之義務、吾人確擬保持之」等語、</p>
<p>後此數日內不致續有發展、內閣未定續開會議、閣員若干人將留居倫敦或倫敦近處俾隨時可以會集、閣員數人將復作假期之出遊、首相包爾溫今夜已返埃克斯萊斯班、麥唐納定明日乘飛機返洛西茅資、</p>
<p>路透電社探悉、九月四日之國聯行政院會議與九月九九之國聯大會、現無理由可臆測其不依尋常方針進行、（廿二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）掌璽大臣麥唐納今日乘飛機返洛西茅資之前、曾主席閣員會議、彼等現留居倫敦或倫敦近處、以便應付因昨日內閣緊急會議之决議發生之任何事伴、今日之會議仍在唐寗街相邸舉行、歷兩小時十五分之久、出席者有財相張伯倫外相郝爾海相孟塞爾陸相海哈列福克斯、昨日內閣會議之决議今日將由尋常外交途徑通吿法政府、或由外相郝爾親吿駐英法大使、惟不欲通吿意國、（廿三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英內閣對於意阿問題、議决兩種辦法、（一）英國决計再度藉外交談判之途徑、以挽回意阿之戰爭、（二）意大利若甘爲戎首、則應如何對付、美聯社今日從可靠方面得悉、英內閣已考慮下列數種問題、（一）地中海與紅海艦隊調動之問題、（二）蘇丹及埃及英國防軍之增加問題、（三）對阿軍火之解禁問題、（四）巴力斯坦英軍之從新分配以便應付意外變故之問題、（五）加速擴充空軍之問題、（六）增加造艦之問題、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>籌思延宕方法　免致戰事立即爆發</h3>
<p>（巴黎）關於意阿爭端之近狀、今晨各報均有所載述、晨報駐倫敦訪員謂、英意兩國現已重循尋常外交途徑、從事交換意見一吾人現可相信英政府業已授權外相霍爾與不管部大臣艾登二人、務於九月四日國聯會行政院開會以前、自行覓獲調解途徑、俾使英意兩國對於阿國經濟利益之對立狀態、得以消除、」巴黎逈聲報駐倫敦訪員相信、英國內閣已將制裁問題澈底研究「事之可以注意者、該國空軍總司令亞靈頓爵士會應邀赴道寗街、經過長時間之議詢、英國政府深知苟無法國海陸軍力之援助、則實施制裁必甚困難、」該訪員又稱、英國政府現頗有將本案設法延宕之傾向、並切願與法國通力合作、「在外交界方面以爲如能拖延時日、則雖費任何代價亦所願爲、因此現擬籌思一種延宕之方法、其法卽在九月四”國聯會行政院開會之時、由意相墨索里尼發表宣言、陳述該國對阿比西尼亞種種不滿意之處、俾將本案再經一番調解、或再行繕製報吿書、提交行政院審核、蓋依照國聯會盟約第十二條之規定、在此項報吿書提交行政院之後、非俟滿足三個月之期限、意大利不能從事戰爭也、苟其不然、意大利竟罔顧一切、則行政院當可按照盟約第十五十六兩條之規定、考慮實施對意制裁也、」小巴黎人報駐倫敦訪員則謂關於軍火出口之解禁問題、祇須首相包爾慍與外相霍爾二人商妥之後、卽可實行、無需徵求全體內閣同意也云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>威林登　紐西蘭首相福勃斯今日發表公吿謂英國如參加戰爭、紐西蘭亦將參加、惟國會於宣戰之前、將先事考慮國家之地位云、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>聞英內閣决議　法國大為寬慰</h3>
<p>（巴黎）此間報紙聞英內閣决定對意阿爭端採取暫待態度、大為寬慰、晨報論調表示滿意、稱英政府並未决定要求九月四日國聯行政院對意制裁、且知將軍火售與未來之交戰國、實非解决爭端之良法、故暫時决定維持軍火出口禁令將來之决議雖可預測、但英國內閣曾討論調和爭端之新辦法、故關係國政府苟具心與善意、則九月四日以前尤有獲得解之可能也、（二十三國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英內閣關於意阿爭案之决議、法國負責各界皆深為滿意、尤其歡迎英法繼續合作之一點、某權威曰「吾人所求者、無更勝於此、吾人對英國之决議、殊自慶幸」云、此間人士現料英法之合作、將首取繼續由外交途徑交換意見之方式、惟法政府遇必要時、當然願與英政府作更進一步之接觸也、（廿二日路透電）</p>
<h3>意大利　積極軍事準備　空軍不斷開東菲</h3>
<p>（倫敦）意當局現正儘速進行軍事準備、據羅馬路透電稱、本星期內船隻、由那泊爾開往東菲者、益見其多、衆信意當局鑒於英政府或有實行日內瓦制裁、封鎖蘇彝士河之可能性、故擬儘速完成軍事準備、惟英國能否在國聯行政院會議獲實行此舉必要之多數贊成票、今尙屬疑問也、聞意國陸軍參謀爲未雨綢繆計、已考慮應付此舉之計畫、昨日飛機母艦一艘載飛機十架飛行員八十人、由那泊爾開往東菲後、今日續有轟炸機與偵察機一分隊、共二十四架、由該港運菲、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>那泊爾　英內閣正在開會考慮意阿爭案之際、意飛機母艦米拉格列亞號載轟炸機與偵察機各五架、已由此開往東菲、並載有飛行員八十人、及意國空軍副參謀長平諾將軍、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）航空母艦密拉格利亞號載運轟炸機九架、偵察機五架、及駕駛員八十人隨郵船賴文那號開往東菲、賴文那號上載有驢馬三百七十五匹、二船離那不勒斯港時、在港者均係意國空軍要人、故引起人民之極大衝動、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>意向德購買大郵船</h3>

<h3>意報對英警告　制裁實同作戰　權利所在决全力以赴之　認外交談判徒枉費唇舌</h3>
<p>（羅馬）英內閣會議之决議繼續禁止軍火輪往意阿兩國、此間聞之、大爲欣慰、蓋初恐英政府或將决議僅許軍火自由運往阿國也、英政府關於國聯之政策繼續維持之决議、爲意人所預料者、惟英政府仍擬由外交途徑繼續談判以求解决意阿爭議、意人皆目爲「意善而無用、」同時意人視軍火自由輸往阿國及封鎖蘇彝士運河之警吿、爲對意之眞實的敵對行爲、意大利日報曾載有蓋達所著一文、謂昨曾撰一淸明和善之文、以吿英國了解意國需要之通達事理者、今不得不再發數言、以吿英國之主張和平者、繼謂制裁卽等於戰爭、英國各報之倡制裁者、其行爲實同作戰、恐因此將令非洲之戰爭波及世界各部分、將成陸海空之破壞戰爭、保衛其生活工作之機利與其榮譽之强毅果敢之人民、必能一怒而爲之也云云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）半官式意大利日報、頃發表論文、指責英國一部份輿論謂其爲一和平主義之極端派·國聯會派頑固之徒·縱火之消防隊員」、幷謂「制裁與戰爭無異」、英國各報現正要求國聯會與英國對於意大利採取制裁手段、例如允許軍火自由運往阿比西尼亞、封鎖蘇彝士運河之類、不一而足、此種辦法、敵視意國、實與現行條約相違背、一旦實行、又與戰爭無異、此其所爲、係爲戰爭而工作、戰事恐將因此而由菲洲蔓延至歐洲、以至於全世界也、「意國所擁護者、乃榮譽生存、與工作之權利、凡此在意國人民視之、實與日用麵包同一重要」、意大利日報嗣又答復倫敦晨郵報日前所發表之論文、謂意國幷不危害大不列顚帝國、所望英國亦不危害意國、則善矣、其結論則謂、「世人所當知者、意國行動、不爲任何事物所阻礙、此項行動、若受有阻礙、而遭遇最大之困難、則意國必以較大之毅力、更爲團結之精神以赴之、英國人以縱火之消防隊員自任者、充其所爲、適足加重阿比西尼亞對於意大利之義務、而意大利要求總結算之理由、亦因之而愈見充足矣」云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>一件、陳藝初布被單一條、姜阿楚布短衫一件、孟子元布短衫褲　套、庭上檢查之下、即令姜·沈·二原告試穿、以觀其所質之衣是否　已物、但沈因服長衫、今將其所質洋裝雨衣穿上、當然不合、且大小亦不配身、旁聽者覩狀均大笑、嗣由</p>

<p>顯不相當</p>
<p>之重利者、處一年以下有期徒刑拘役或科或併科一千元以下罰金」是明明規定須乘他人急迫之際、但按照典當慣例、來當憑物、贖當憑票、故當者姓名及典欵之用途、一概不問不聞、無論其與欵買米或賭博、典當不得而知、是無乘人急迫之可言、與刑法</p>

<p>且本案各原告旣經詢明均不相激、何能食同延請樂律師於同一日期出　警告、况內有一人於廿三號質物、而典當即於是日接到律師之信、顯係　有計劃無疑、此點應請注意、再查民法規定利息最大者、雖不得超越二分、但</p>
<p>如有超越</p>
<p>亦不過無請求權而已、譬如當者不贖、則典當無請求取　之權、再刑法規定有取得非法重利字樣、今杳各原告并未取贖、自無损失之可言、應請諭知各被告無罪、馮推事逐諭本案論終結、定下星期上午宣判、</p>

<p>康樂特刊</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 鈍根</p>
<p>康樂特刊非廣告也。康樂素非戒煙藥也。閱報諸君驟見康樂特刊之標題。不加詳審。　下武斷曰。是康樂製藥廠宣傳戒煙藥之廣告也。棄之弗顧。則殊辜負編行者之苦心矣。夫康樂者人生唯一之需求。求之而不得其法則結果適得其反。本刋宗旨。在集思廣益。供獻國人以增進健康取得快樂之方法。如何修養性業。如何煆鍊身體。如何發展事菜。如何顯揚名譽。且更於研究衛生討論世道之外。多載有趣味之文字。藉以引起讀者興趣。而蘇息精神疲勞。亦造成康樂之一道也。至於康樂素為現代醫藥界最新發明之一種大補劑。其功用之奇偉。擊紙難書。無論老幼男婦。均可服用注射。持以恒心凈信。眞能却病延年。回天再造。蓋人類生活之原素。在各部分細胞中發生一種高基氏體。使人精神興奮。身體健旺。凡先天不足。或久病衰弱者。尤其是吸雅片煙者。其高基氏體之供給。異常缺少。必待鴉片煙或相類之品。刺激榨取。始得勉强供給。不啻向銀行作透支。終必破產而後已。惟服用康樂素。則高基氏體自然滋生補充。漸臻富足。與健康人無異。更無借助鴉片之必要。吾故曰。康樂素能治百病。復健康。初非專用以戒煙之藥。惟試之戒煙。見效最速而顯著。人逐以戒煙藥目之。製造者唐家珍醫師。發行者陳小蝶先生。深慨同胞困於鴉片者之多也。以為衆既稱道康樂素救鴉片毒有奇效。公認為戒煙妙劑。則吾儕亦不妨以戒煙藥自居。而先用力於拯拔同胞出離黑籍之工作焉。且吾國所以累貧積弱。未能享一日之康樂者。鴉片誠為一大障礙。當道諸公。痛心疾首。三令五申。若曰。外海不足憂。內亂不足患。惟吸鴉片者。實負亡國滅極之責。故處治煙民。宜殺無赦。而煙民心中。則亦自有一腔寃苦。含淚俯首而不敢言。其意則謂。吾以自己之錢。吸自己之煙。與人無患。與世無爭。法律以妨害他人為犯罪之原則。吾非但不傷於公德。無礙於治安。且以重疊之捐稅。仰助軍費政費。奈何動觸法網。朝不保暮。處此環境。孰不思戒。顧什九為疾病所牽纏。而新派醫生多少年操切。略不體貼戒煙者之痛苦。更無根本救濟身體虧弱之靈藥。逐致欲戒者趨趄不前。而已戒者終於復吸。今吾編輯康樂特刋之用意。卽欲報告吸煙同胞以康樂素之奇驗神效。補益身體。去病萬全。旣有如此妙藥。更何憚而不戒。一方面固為協助政府禁煙之進行。一方面更為吸煙同胞代白無窮之寃苦。暢所欲言。字字打入諸君心坎。庶對康樂素之信仰。釋然無疑。諸君亦可投稿。各自陳述吸煙之經過。種種不同之病情。務使胸中鬰悶。盡情發洩。精神為之一快。而後服用康樂素以戒煙。收效更速。故康樂特刋出版之始。多討論戒煙文字。後乃漸及於其他一切衛生問題焉。惟望閱報諸君。勿誤為尋常戒煉藥之廣告。毫無趣味。而置之不顧。則編輯者幸甚。</p>
<h3>康樂蛋黄素利物濟人</h3>
<p>— 吴鐵城</p>
<h3>蛋黃素戒煙之原理</h3>
<p>— 唐家珍</p>
<p>按唐醫師此文早經印入康樂素說明書各報</p>
<p>所載醫家著述多有獵取之者本刊特為重佈據歷年來各國學者之觀察。知人體組織各細胞中。含有一種主要部分。曰「高基氏體」。Golgis　Body在各部份多寡不一。而以腦及神經內所含為最豐富。此體化學成分為類脂質。卽蛋黃素等是也。</p>
<p>自經馬文昭敎授數年之深切研究。發現各細胞中當「高基氏體」增加時。則人之精神奮發。思想翻陳出新。四肢運用亦愉快異常。反是則體疲力倦。周身酸懶。奄奄無生氣矣。</p>
<p>雅片。嗎啡。紅丸。及海洛英之作用。在能刺激血中之赤血球。使其產生大量之「血小板」。血小板所含無他。亦卽此類脂質耳。由血中數種白血球。採取此質。運輸於各器官。而各器官之細胞。得此類脂質後。卽造成其本體內之「高基氏體」。由此觀之。雅片等所增加之「高基氏體」。乃完全由其刺激作用而生。吸煙或打針旣久。此種類脂質。卽非藉雅片或嗎啡之力。不能運行。故一且停止吸煙或打針時「血小板一之數量大减。白血球因之停帶於血管內。不作運輸工作。而各器官之細胞。當然無從吸收此類脂質。因之固有之「高基氏體」亦大减其數量。或完全消失。而人之精神及身體。則呈種種不安之狀態矣。</p>
<p>蛋黃素對於戒煙之特效。則因其中成分。與血小板所含之要素相似。蓋同為類脂質也。此素服後。白血球卽可直接自腸內採取類脂質而送達於各器官之細胞。細胞獲此大量之類脂質後卽可營其正常之工作。一方面無須間接取自赤血球。則赤血球可得休養而增加其效能也。</p>
<p>吾人在服用蛋黃素期間。「高基氏體」旣能由腸內直接採取類脂質而增加其數量。故得脫離雅片等之統制。一旦將雅片嗎啡紅丸或海洛英减少。或竟屏棄之。「高基氏體」因有充分蛋黃素為其後盾。不致有减少或消失之患。而達生理戒煙之目的矣。</p>
<p>蛋黃素又為一大補劑。早經各國醫師。用之於神經衰弱。貧血第一二期。肺癆及虛弱等症。其作用亦在補充細胞內之類脂質耳。蓋細胞內之類脂質充滿。則體力充實。精神旺盛。一方對於微生物之抵抗力亦大增加。是以能消滅其毒質。則病狀漸减。而臻健康之境。</p>
<p>康樂素為康樂製藥廠自製出品。取自新鮮鷄蛋黃。含動物性蛋黃素百分之九十以上。為半固體。色帶深黃。無臭無味。一切原料。完全國產。新鮮純良。遠勝任何舶來品。</p>
<h3>培養原氣增進健康</h3>
<p>— 吴醒</p>
<h3>戒煙福音</h3>
<p>— 李</p>
<p>— 王</p>
<p>天生人體强弱不齊欲轉弱而為强賴藥力以調劑澄淸腦經惟一妙計</p>
<p>家庭　之康樂　其效力不可思議</p>
<h3>敬告讀者</h3>
<p>— 小蝶</p>
<p>自康樂素發行以來。戒煙見效者。頗多出於意料之外。譬如依服法。預定至少要二十天或三十天可以戒除。而事實上竟有十天就戒除了的。但是也有戒了三分之二。後漸濡緩。不能立時斷根的。我們覺得這不是藥力的靈不靈。却是戒煙人的內信心堅不堅。若要戒煙人的自信心堅。尤其要對於所采取的戒煙藥品。充分認識。一方面更要製造者有充分的進善利研究。因為戒煙者身體種種的不同。因戒煙而發生的病狀。也種種不同。我們同然狠希望服康樂素的給與我們一種經過的報告。就是采取別種藥品戒煙的。也能彀與我們一個商榷。不但希望承認康樂紫為一種戒煙良好藥物的。與我們一種贊許。更希望不滿意於康東素的。也與我們一種批評。因為創造康樂素的原旨。是在援助一般吸煙者脫離苦海。不是要為牟利。所以决計犧牲了大幅廣告地位。來編輯一種特刊。希望然心戒煙諸君子。多多與以投稿。儘量的發揮個人意見。便用大家一致起來拒毒。完成戒煙工作。則本刊有厚望焉。</p>
<h3>蛋黃素之鑒別</h3>
<p>— （簡明）</p>
<p>蛋黃素可由三種物質取得之。一為動物腦質。二為蛋黃。三為大荳。三者之中。效力最顯著者。厥為蛋黃中之蛋黃紫。據許多學者試騐之結果。蛋黃素確為有力之補品。已如前述。卽無煙癮之人。亦可自由服食。自然體重增加。思想聰敏。容光煥發。且絕對無毒。及任何副作用。故蛋黃素不但為戒煙品。亦一種重要之補劑也。</p>
<p>但市上所售。間有非純粹蛋黃所提煉者。茲特列表以明之。</p>
<h3>康樂素戒煙之簡易法：</h3>
<p>凡有煙癮之人。服此素五日。其功效卽能流通全體。可减煙量四分之一。服過十日。可减煙量四分之二。服過半月。可减煙量四分之三。服過二十天。則煙癮完全除盡。毫無痛苦。服至一月。身體完全復原壯健。見烟自厭。以後如能常服三四粒。以代補品。不但永得康樂。且聞到鴉片煙味。卽作惡心。自然遠避。卽多年老癮。亦不復發。服量多寡。參照左表。</p>
<p>盒裝服法用於戒煙者每日三次飯後用開水送服用為補劑者每日三次每次二粒</p>
<h3>鴉片源流考</h3>
<p>— 陳劍農</p>
<p>鴉片之輸入中國發端於唐德宗貞元年間。前人筆記有「阿拉伯」商人者。始將罌粟漿輸入中國境內。作醫療疾病之用。頗著奇效。又一說則謂唐高宗乾封年間。西域「拂麻國」遣使進貢「底也伽」。此底也伽。卽鴉片之別名。猶我人之稱「福壽膏」「阿芙蓉」也。此說果確。則較貞元尤早矣。考之正史。絕少證明。要之晚唐之際。中國確已有此毒品。且彼時國人自己亦能栽種。據可考者分記如左。</p>
<p>唐人詩中之鴉片詩人雍陶作「西歸斜谷」詩云</p>
<p>行過險棧出裏斜。歷盡平川似到家。</p>
<p>無限客愁今日散。馬前初見米囊花。</p>
<p>又李貞白「詠罌栗子」云。</p>
<p>倒排雙陸子。稀插碧牙籌。旣似犧牛乳。</p>
<p>又如鈴馬兜。鼓槌並瀑箭。直是有來由。</p>
<p>觀上二詩。鴉片之在晚唐時流入中原。已無疑義。米囊花卽罌栗花。罌栗之漿。乃製造鴉片土之原料。不過當初鴉片之輸入中國。係作一種貴重藥品耳</p>
<p>佛書中之鴉片唐人所譯佛書「毗奈耶雜事」中。亦有此項記載。「佛家有病。可以吸煙。法以兩碗相合。底上穿一孔。中着火置藥。再以鐵管長尺許者置孔吸之」。此種吸煙法。實為後來燈搶之蒿矢。</p>
<p>蘇東坡與鴉片宋大詩人蘇東坡亦有關於此種毒品之吟詠。如</p>
<p>道人勸飲鷄蘇水。童子能煎罌栗湯。</p>
<p>此外。尚有詠此毒品之專集。名「種藥苗」詩。內中專咏罌粟。及服食罌粟湯等。想唐宋時代。鴉片極稀少而名貴。降至明代。雖已流及民間。亦尚不若現時之多。「大明會典」記載各國貢品。若暹　邏爪哇等國。均以鴉片進獻。而成化間憲示遺人收買鸦片。其值與黃金相捋。珍貴可知矣。再後百餘歲。至神宗萬歷十七年。其關稅表中。載有鸦片二斤。值銀寶二個云。自是以後。鸦片之輸入。源源不絕。而價亦漸低。又考外夷來華互市歷史。葡萄牙人為最先。當明中葉。來居澳門。握東亞貿易之霸權。鴉片一物。實為其大宗重要貨品。故粵人首罹其毒。及至明末淸初英人在東亞貿易之潛勢日漸澎漲。乃由印度販運鴉片入中國。惟當時藉口作藥品。可以醫療疾病。我執政者只知科以進口稅。絕不以為毒品。且服用者僅為　建廣東沿海等處人民。尚未流入內地。故民間鮮有注意而反對者。　（未完）</p>
<h3>虞美人館雜記（一）</h3>
<p>— 鈍根</p>
<p>按虞美人館為小蝶所改題。余不願作楚覇王也。一笑。</p>
<p>怪習慣</p>
<p>吸鴉片是一種大習慣。如同時兼作他事。亦必隨之而成副習慣。有吸煙時須兼飲茶者。有食糖果者。更有須齡豬者。予嘗見一友。每吸煙必喝極猛烈之燒酒一大碗。肥肉一大碗。某筆記所載。一人有愛子。甫五歲。常嬉煙榻前。父每令翻觔一次。輙犒以鴉片一口。後此子年長。亦成大癮，每吸煙一口。必就地翻觔斗一次。否則不快也。又一人。弱冠時。閉門私吸鴉片。恐為父母所知。常趨門側。伏隙外窺。偵父母來否。後成大　。父母雖死。而吸煙時猶頻頻躍起。趨窺門隙。否則不能過癮也。又聞某名夫人。吸煙時。須屏人局戶。盡褫衣服。一絲不掛。而後翹足狂吸。務使一室迷濛。全身葬煙霧中。於意始快。</p>
<p>拼命吸煙</p>
<p>林文忠公禁烟時。犯者輙斬首。相傳有一卒。奉令於夜間看守被斬未殮之屍。文忠偶出巡視。乃見此卒方籌燈臥屍堆中吸烟。卽以人頭作枕。因并斬之。此卒可謂愍不畏死。直有「頭可斷鴉片不可不吸」之氣概。然由此可見徒以嚴刑禁煙。而不為烟犯謀根本救毒之出路。無益也。</p>
<h3>浦江又獲得鱷魚</h3>
<p>住居浦東冰廠內勤餘里八號之江北人邵章生。張和尚二人、前日午後、在廣東路與洋涇浜之間浦灘邊、發現怪獸一具、在水面爬行、急將兩隻划船拼起、冉用繩套住其腰部、熬費氣力、始得拖起、察得確係鱷魚、惹起岸上行人注意、一時圍觀者甚衆、兩人以為奇貨可居、急切檯回家中、置於長桶內放水靜養、查該魚身長五華尺許、有四足及一長　、前足五爪、後足四爪、渾身烏色、背部分顯為長方塊形、頭長約一尺弱、形狀極似穿山甲、性頗馴善、食肉類、呌聲極小、似鬼號、入晚鼻聲如雷、一若老年人酣睡者然、　日前往觀看者粉至沓來、均以少見為奇、按數日前曾見報載有人亦在廣東路浦灘捕鱷魚一頭、可謂無獨有偶云、</p>

<h3>證券　政局安定　公債末盤回好　惟結果大都仍跌</h3>

<h3>糧食　廠商套粉行販套麥　標準步步下游</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市、上下兩市均見盤軟之局、因日來客帮久無暢化、而各廠存積與製出則漸見多、因廠有洋麥抵申、足以應解拋貨而有餘、因此一方向外埠求售、一方在市塲套出、出意甚濃、進戶觀望、市乃步步下鬆、且抽現加價五分一舉、已議即日取消、客囤進計更多袖手、但以原料成本高昂、亦難十分跌落云、收市價八九十月各小一分、十一月小七五、十二月一月各小一分云、</p>
<p>麥昨日麥市、上午開布後洋麥雖一致報漲、美麥漲七八角、坎麥小五六角、但定貨不劃、各方均不聞問、且現貨廠方不動、少數行販則向所中套出標準、業外囤戶完全停手、市價隨至一再趨下、下午被粉市影響、市氣更軟、牧價八月十月十一月一月各小五分、九月小六分、十二月小四分、現麥各廠繼續擯持不辦、一部份行販頗有求售之意、市上雖無正式市面、而配廠貨則又小三四分矣、</p>

<h3>新來到貨漸多　陳米暴跌三四角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到二十餘號、（貨共四千石左右）、下游市况、今則更有暴跌、良以天時晴正、各處見新漸多、致人心尤處、零躉銷塲旣滯、遂造成此不景氣象、故各厚粳及薄稻等行情悉續渲三角有奇、竟至有四角者、杜洋尖及陰變元亦跌一二角不等、東新再小二尺、葉榭新粳今亦上市、價開八元八角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源二十三四號、市一去胃各貨均見淡弱、市價白粳又小二角、早稻跟小一角、薄稻價短角許、東新粳價小二尺、新客尖價小數分至一角、新團尖價短二三角、白元價小角外、其餘各貨亦小近角、</p>
<h3>生油突漲半元</h3>
<p>近日豆油及花生油銷塲不湧、市塲中交易祇有聽價交易、而無正式賣買、昨花生油因新陳不接、來源寥寥、本市底積碍於昔日去路平常、貨戶先已陸續走完、故在此正式開盤之下、市價即呈突漲半元、計開泊兒生油一百件、價為十五元、夾倉生油二百件、價為十四元八角、豆油　開本廠油二百件、輪大連油五十件、輪沙河歧山油三百件、沙船牛莊油五十件、輪牛莊油百五十件、行情比較前市不相上落，</p>

<p>昨日糖市、以關金微鬆趨勢略軟公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨以十七元二角、稍有成交、比降五分、轉口貨五元三角半、未成、太古糖B嘜、因行家手貨告斷、公司新到之貨、呌漲三角半、須十八元四角半、方肯開兌、尚未成盤、本廠綿白振裕一號仍十六元四角、二三四號照退、號貨有廣潮帮開出海南赤二百餘包十元〇二角、比小一角、又奇白七八十包、十三元六角半、　據汕頭訊、潮青登記事聞將解决之說、後貨或可照常運申、確否待證、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子銷暢價漲</h3>
<p>黑瓜子近以地價步緊、行方進意甚濃、昨開出一千餘包、計明光子四百數十包、八元三角至二角、毫州子四百餘包、九元、泰興子五十包、十元六角、滙溪口子一百包、十二元二角、徐魁子一百包、十一元八角、比升一二角至三四角不等、尚有號存徐魁子堅持卡開、仍着續緊、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵客銷復活</h3>
<p>二百磅會司鐵、自到貨多後、市上因　業急圖脫手、所以供愈多而求者愈少、緣是標準節節下降、最低價每　祇開二十六元、但以連日外滙短小、共成本已超過至二十七元光景、雖以公會討諭漲價、奈環境不佳、致寶際仍乏大宗買賣、前昨以來、如天津烟台青島等客帮、銷路突然發動、查開出為數共達六七百箱之多、致市勢甚佳、而人心亦巳回蘇、况本街廠家亦因正號馬口鐵飛漲不已、故均改辦會司鐵、致問津及談判者亦比前熱鬧、據熟悉此貨情形者云、如九十磅一百磅等馬口鐵目下市貨已有青黃不接之勢、會司鐵以價格低廉、頗合　用、預料來日市面必有良好之消息也、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>生活只能昭示人們的前進，沒落實是自己的錯誤。</p>
<p>我們在事業黯澹，經濟窘迫，生活十分艱難的時侯，放在眼前的兩條路，一條果是在誘惑你到頹廢消極，甚至挺而走險的岐途去，可是，那另一條路，却也正就是使我們檢察過去的失敗原因，得到正當的啟示，而獲着最大的長進。</p>
<p>生產與消費，是人們生活上所必有的權利與義務，但，在現下，却往往有不少的人們，在不事生產，専於燈紅酒綠下　情陶醉，作他那粉紅色的迷夢，而另一部人，却正胼手胝足，辛苦經營，欲謀粗茶淡飯而不得。</p>
<p>「六月爐邊打鐵，嚴寒江上漁翁，」這正是給與我們生活奮鬥最好的啟示，尤其一般初入社會的靑年，為開拓自已未來的園地，更應當怎樣以全部的心和力，整個的生命，去貢獻給社會，最經濟，最有效地使用。</p>
<h3>紅頭阿三考</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>凡住在或到過上海的朋友們，總常見過那黑臉虬髯大漢，頭纏著紅布，站在馬路中間，或伸手，或舉棍，指揮着行人車輔，怪有權威的。這種大漢，來自印度，人都叫他印度巡捕，可是大多數人則叫他「紅頭阿三」。</p>
<p>細繹「紅頭阿三」這個名稱，「紅頭」二字，意頗明顯；惟「阿三」則殊費解，因印度巡捕旣執有無上權威，他何以不被呼作「阿大」或「阿二」而竟屈居「第三」，這頗費猜測的。有人說，蘇州人喚猢猻做「阿三」，今移以稱印度巡捕，是極言其身手伶活，目光銳利，有如猢猻一般，這恐不確。</p>
<p>一說，「阿三」是O　Sir的諧音。租界警務向執在西人手裏。印度巡捕位卑職小，對上司報告，自然只能唯唯否否，說那O　Sir，O　Sir。其說雖似近理，然下屬呼上司，例應舉其官銜以示尊崇，不應僅說O　Sir，O　Sir,故這說亦恐似是而非。</p>
<p>又有一說，「阿三」是I　Say的諧音，其說似較合理。印度巡描有所報告，上司因聽不懂而追問What　do　you　say？（你說什麼？），自是當然的事，印捕巡捕因於陳述正文之先，冠以I　Say……（我說……）亦是應有的事，一般國人因不諳此二字的意義，只聽見印度巡捕開I　Say，閉口I　say，逐誤以為那巡捕的名字叫做「阿三」，於是「紅頭阿三」竟成印度巡捕的綽號了。</p>
<p>這三說之中，我以為以後說為是，不知對否。（按「紅頭」現已改為藍黃之色相間的頭了，然而「紅頭阿三」的名稱，依然存在。）</p>
<h3>游泳碎錦</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>游泳季開始而後，上海人的游泳熱又和寒暑表成正比例的昇高起來，在上海，幾個游泳池裏，最熱鬧當然要算虹口游泳池了。對於游泳有相當嗜好的我，這年頭又上虹口去游過幾次水，這裏拉雜的寫些碎錦。</p>
<p>當我第一次下池游水的時候，覺得比以前分外的吃力，也許為的是去年全個年頭沒有去遊過的緣故吧？接着休息了一回，第二次下池，就不覺得吃力了。</p>
<p>向來虹口游泳池裏，游泳的人脫下的衣帽物件，是沒人負責替你保管的；因此，衣服被竊，錢鈔不翼而飛等事，常會發生。可是今年已有寄物的地方，每人的衣服，什物，可交到寄物處，換了一塊銅牌，游好了拿銅牌去領回來。所以你上虹口去游水，可不必再穿破衣服去了。</p>
<p>在虹口游泳池裏，女人眞是不少吓！但伊們之中，會游水的却是不多，因為身上雖是十九穿着一九三五式羊毛泳衣，而深水的地方，再沒有人敢去的。一位朋友感慨系之的對我說：「女人在游泳池裏，無非裝陽，會游水的究竟不多！」然而他不知道伊們雖多數不會游水，攝了一張照片，明天刋在畫報上，冠上一個女游泳家的銜頭，西洋鏡又有誰去拆穿啊！</p>
<p>第一天去游水的時候，幾個西洋人太討人厭了，他們在水裏追逐，狂呼，一些不守公共塲所的秩序，誰說西洋人此我們文明得多，我是始終不信！</p>
<h3>房東的厄運</h3>

<h3>智能的遺傳</h3>
<p>— 賓錫</p>
<p>一個嗜酒而好色的男子和一個淫蕩而低能的女子相結合，結果是無疑地產生許多不健全的後代。不錯，我們從生理方面去研究，所謂『馬生駒，牛生犢，』親子的形質一定是很相像的，不但此也，我們更從心理方面去觀察，知道「智慧與能力」也同樣地遺傳下去，而且彩響於後代很大，心理學者Goddard氏研究心理劣點之遺傳，很為詳盡，曾經把Kallikak氏之家譜，很完全的加以一番研究：而且供獻於我們讀者之前：事情是這樣的，美國革命時，有少年名Martin　Kallikak者，良家子弟，與一低能婦私通，產一兒，實肖其母氏，此後其後商四百八十人中，無一非低能見，據Goddard統計之結果，四百八十人中，一百四十三人確定為低能人，三十六人為私生子女，三人為罪犯，三人患癎病，四十一人性慾上有不道德行為者，二十四人害酒瘋，八十二人天殤，革命後，Martin娶一普通女子，其後裔中無一柢能，且有不少天才或近於天才者，這一家兩支系同州同縣而居，不自知互為血屬，且低能一系的後裔，曾有一人傭於第二支之後裔家。</p>
<p>讀者，我們看了這椿事實後，我們感到低能之遺傳及其所造成的罪惡，貧苦，疾病等。的確是一個驚人的紀錄，我們要提倡「優生，」來避免這可怖的低能的遺傳，注意結婚，限止低能者生殖，這未始非「改良人種」之一法！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十八回　戚黨高攀逢迎斥小吏雌威大作嘈雜惱夫人</p>
<p>裘則誠穿了灰嗶嘰夾袍，套了靑馬褂，光凈的面皮，微微的養了一抹上唇鬍子，倒不失個官僚樣兒。他見了張介夫，立刻在光凈的面皮上，泛出了愁苦的樣子，兩道眉峯，差不多皺成一綫。便道你怎麼也到西安來了。只說那這句話，他已經和各歡迎代表去說話，將介夫丟在一邊，他並不忙，靜隨在則誠之後，等則誠把代表們都送走了。就低聲笑道：我在此地，已經得了銀行界朋友的帮助，可以在建設應方面，找一個位置。則誠是一面走路，一面和他說話的。聽了這種話，才把脚站定，因道：那就很好了。介夫扛了肩膀笑道，只是事情大小不能定，能得在藍專員這方面找一張八行，這就大妥了。你看，這墻上的標語，都是我做的。雖然，不過是幾張紙，可是替藍先生增了風光不少。則誠這才留意到墻上的標語。看到標語下而，全落了有張介夫的下欵便將臉色變着，重喝一聲道：你簡直是胡鬧！說着這話時，立定了脚，根根的向他瞪了一眼。連他鄉遇故知，應該說的幾句寒喧談，也一字沒提竟自走了。介夫走到過路的穿堂中間，却是不免呆上了一呆。身後却有人叫道：張先生，你今天實在是忙得很呵！看時，却是自己所說帮忙的銀行界人。（二九八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>頭髮眞是一件最討厭的東西，尤其當人的年事稍高時，黑髪一根的變灰白起來，更令人可恨」！太后一面對着鏡子仔細揣詳伊自己的頭髮，一面向我說道：「而像我們處在這種地位上的人，越發不能讓它們灰白起來。這倒不是我們的虛榮心在作怪，事實上我們確有不能不使我們的皮相，處處保持着完美的狀態的必要；就為這個緣故，我們便非把頭髮染黑不可！」</p>
<p>伊這樣說了，我就用心瞧伊究竟怎樣的染黑伊的頭髪。</p>
<p>在伊的梳裝檯的某一具抽屜內，藏着有幾缸顏色深黑，而且瞧上去彷彿是極富膠質的東西；太后便隨手取出了一缸來，待那理髮匠把伊的長髮鬆解了下來，並很小心地輕輕篦過一番之後，伊自己便取起一柄不很大的毛刷來，打那缸裏蘸了些黑色的東西，塗上髮去。這東西的確也能使伊頭上的一部份灰髮變為黑髮，然而伊的頭皮，却也連帶的被染黑了。我瞧伊用盡方法，極小心地刷着，希望祇把頭髮染黑，不要沾污頭皮，委實是非常可憐；但結果仍然是一起染黑了。我瞧伊差不多就要大怒起來了，可是這個不可避免的結果，伊已足足經騐了一二十年了，因此伊終於還能竭力忍耐，把這一般無名火消為烏有。自從伊的頭髮開始一根根的變成灰白色以來，這許多年數中間，伊的頭皮可說未曾白過，老是給那髮膏染黑着，絕無挽敎之策。（三九八）</p>

<p>吃飯的代價　吃飯難，因為吃飯的艱難，而人又不能不吃飯；於是為了吃飯，而時時鬧出笑話了。前幾天蘇州某小飯店中，來了一位短衣仁兄，他坐停之後，就大魚大肉的點了五六道菜肴，飯店裏的堂倌，見這位客人，一起手就點了這許多菜肴，當然是大主顧哩。於是打手巾，倒濃茶，招待得異常週到。那位客人等小菜來了，虎嚥狼吞的大嚼起來，不但把菜肴吃去大半，並且還吃了三碗白飯。堂倌等他吃完了飯，洗過了臉，正要將菜賬拿上；那知這位仁兄立起身來，拍了拍肚皮說道：「吃好哉，你們來罷！堂倌見了這個樣兒，莫明其妙，那知客人却一本正經的說道：「殺人抵命，吃飯還錢？我吃了你們的飯，當然要付你們的錢，不過我身上現在分文沒有；飯是吃了，所以把這身體，做我吃飯的代價。，你們來打一頓出出氣罷！無論把我打得怎樣，我决不還手呌　」。堂倌聽了，無法可想，急急告訴老闆，老　恐怕打出人命，也無法可想；於是這位以身體換飯吃的　　，　他們無法可想　，安安易易吃到了　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一頓豐美的鈑。</p>
<p>殺狗趣談　蘇州前幾天曾一度捕殺野狗，可是因為手續的殘忍，引起了慈善家的護狗運動。在捕殺的第一笑，在公安局對門人家的一隻家狗，因為事前照會未曾領到，在晨光熹徴中，就給警士一鐵棍打得腦槳迸裂，等到養狗的主人，聞聲趕出，早已狗命鳴呼；於是這位狗主人悲傷萬分，特地購了幾刀錫箔，摺成紙錠，到公安局門首焚化，一面號　痛哭，大喊：「阿黃死得寃枉，請清天大老爺伸寃」！</p>
<p>自殺的技術　王先生近來天天換了游泳衣上游泳池去，他的朋友小陳對他笑道：「老王，你這樣勤懇練習游泳，難道想練習好了，和美人魚競賽一下麼？」王先生聽了，正色道：「小夥子！你可知家有千金，不如一技隨身；在這個年頭，自殺是人人說不定的。我學會了游泳，自殺起來，可以投河，就是沒有人來救，有了這游泳的技術，到了危險的時候，也可以自己爬到岸上，不會溺死哩！」</p>
<p>打氣的功用　吳家的小孩子，見那　　的汽球，放在輕氣瓶上，一霎時漲成各色各樣胖胖的汽球，覺得異常好玩。他在旁邊看着正覺得津津有味，有一個汽球，因汽灌得太足了，斗砰的炸了開來，小孩子吃了一嚇，連忙逃走，一天他家來了一個大胖子的客人，小孩子對着那客人圓鼓鼓的肚皮，服了一眼，連忙逃到裏面，一邊嚷道：「這大大的皮球，汽打得太足了，炸裂開來，那聲音一定要嚇死人哩！」</p>

<h3>小型交直流收音機中之交流聲</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>近日小型交直流收音機，頗為盛行，但因其地位另件力求節省之故，常有可厭之交流聲發生。此種交流聲，倘能加以檢查，亦不難察出其來源，而設去减少之。</p>
<p>交流聲之來源　此種交流聲，大概不外下列諸來源：</p>
<p>（一）來自乙電源供給部份，此因所用濾波電容器容量過小，或成音週率阻流綫圈過小，或竟以固定耗阻器代替，致尚有一部份交流波動，未能濾凈。</p>
<p>（二）擴聲器勵磁綫圈（Field）中之交流波動，影響於音圈（Voice　Coil），而引起極大之交流聲。</p>
<p>（三）由檢拾雜散之磁力綫或電力綫而引起交流聲。</p>
<p>（四）自電源供給綫傳入之電訊，在整流部份受交流調幅後，亦可被其餘部份檢拾而生交流聲。</p>
<p>（五）熱絲電流（Heater　Current）之磁力綫，亦可感應至其他部份而生交流聲</p>
<p>（六）眞空管之陰極與熱絲間，因漏電過大而生交流聲。</p>
<p>確定交流聲發生之所在在着手减免交流聲之前，先須查出其來源之所在，法以銅絲一根，先短路第一射電週率級之輸入，再短路其輸出，以試交流聲有否减少；然後以同一方法，自射電週率部份起至成音週率部份，逐級試之：如試某部而交流聲大减者，卽知此部份為交流聲之發生處也。若度至末級真空管而交流聲仍不减少者，則弊病大概在電源供給部份。</p>
<p>避免交流聲之方法旣探知交流聲之來源，第二步手續，當然為設法以减免之，常用之法如下：</p>
<p>倘有足够之地位，則可設法加大濾波電容器之容量；此法不但可减少交流聲，且足增進乙電壓之電壓穩定度（Volgage　regulation）</p>
<p>在整流管之屏極陰極間，加接容量約〇·〇五券法拉特之傍路電容器。</p>
<p>在電源進綫間，跨接〇·〇五至〇·二五券法拉特之傍路電容器。</p>
<p>若用25Z5式整流管者，則試以一組屏極陰極供給擴聲器勵磁綫圈之電流，另一組則供給乙電，亦可减少交流聲。但有時若以其二組屏極陰極並連，而同時供給擴聲器之勵磁電流與乙電流，反可减少交流聲。</p>
<p>如所用擴聲器備有「交流聲减除綫圈（HumReducingCoil）」者，有時加以調整，亦可减少交流聲。</p>
<p>如某級因檢起雜磁塲或雜電塲而引起交流聲：則在其屏回路或柵回路或簾栅回路，試加濾除器，頗為有効；但有時須將另件及接綫重行排列，使帶有交流電壓者，不與帶有訊號電壓者過于接近，始得將交流聲减除。所云濾除器，為一耗阻器與一電容器連接而成，普通用一萬至二十五萬歐姆，及〇·〇五至〇。一券法拉特；詳細數目可試騐决定之。</p>
<p>如各級眞空管之熱絲串連使用者，應將最易引起交流聲之真空管之熱絲接至靠近地電位之一邊。照普通情形而論；無極外差式中最易引起交流聲者為第二檢波，次之為混合管，射電週率管，輸出管，整流管，然後接至降壓耗阻器。在射電週率放大式者，則應以檢波管接近地電位，次之者為射電週率管，輸出管，而後整流管。詳細接法並不拘定，最佳試騐决定。</p>
<p>熱絲陰極間漏電過大之眞空管，應卽更換新者。</p>
<p>此種收音機中之整流管，甚易衰老，應換新試之。</p>
<p>如用綠氣整流管者，屏極串連一枚四份亨利之阻流綫圈，可减少交流聲。</p>
<p>其他如有斷綫短路及損壤之另件，自應加以修正，不必多贊。</p>
<h3>新最式壓電晶體聽筒</h3>
<p>— 丁曦</p>
<p>新近發明一稱聽筒，是以晶體來代替舊式聽筒中的磁鐵和綫圈。牠的構造的主要部份是一片５＼８英寸正方，0.010英寸厚的壓電晶體，連着一個錐形，裝在最優等電木殼子裏，形式是極為美觀。</p>
<p>這種聽筒的優點極多；舊式聽筒認為不可能的都達到了，現在一條一條的列在下面：</p>
<p>（一）普通的聽筒，音調過高或過低的聲音都要失眞；或者根本就聽不出來。但是這種壓電晶體聽筒在60至10000週率以內的音波都可以淸晰傳播出來，尤其是高音部份，更使人滿意。</p>
<p>（二）這種聽筒耗阻極高，在1000週時約為5000歐姆：和普通舊式4000歐姆的相較，要大到十餘倍：所以極為靈敏，雖很小的電流，也能發出頗響的聲音。</p>
<p>（三）這種聽筒的重量很輕，總計衹有6英兩Ounce所以用者更覺舒適。有</p>
<p>有這幾點優點，舊式聽筒的缺憾差不多可以說是解决了；尤其是短波收音機，更為適宜，不過現在售價太昂，需美金十二元。</p>
<p>壓電晶體聽筒和收音機的聯接法與通常略有不同，下面這幾幅圖是示其大概。</p>
<h3>夏季無綫電上的諸問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 春</p>
<p>四　接收靈敏度。</p>
<p>為什麼冬天能稱做「遠距離的季節」（DX　Season）而夏天却不能呢？要明白這個，不能不瞭解電波傳播的情形：從電台所發射出來的電波，分兩方播射一沿地面前進，叫做地波，極易被吸收而衰减，不能及遠。一向空間發射，叫做天波，天波能由海氏層的反射再達地上。</p>
<p>海氏層的成因，是由於：</p>
<p>一，地球鐳錠等發射綫。</p>
<p>二，放射物質的透徹性發射綫。</p>
<p>三，太陽所散射下來的細微電子。</p>
<p>四，太陽所散射下來的緊外綫。</p>
<p>至於他的發生由於一·二·的原因較少，大都由於太陽中放射下來的電子同大氣間的氣體發生衝撞而生，存在於地球的周圍。海氏曾，他又因性質的不同，而分為兩種，距地面一百公里的地方，叫E層，E層之上一百里，叫F層。</p>
<p>電波，因波長的差異，他的發射狀態也就不同了。</p>
<p>長波（三千公尺以上）的，電波沿地面前進，不入海氏層。</p>
<p>中波及短波（五十公尺至三千公尺）相當進入海氏層，漸次屈折回至海面。這種電波，晝間衰落極烈，晚上則較少因此，夜間常能聽到白畫完全聽不到的遠地播音。</p>
<p>短波及超短波（五十公尺以下），短波已不在E層屈折。通過了E層而在F層屈折，反射至地面。但是超短波，在F層也不屈折，電波通過了F層，遠遠地離開地球了。</p>
<p>夏季的電波，因受强烈的天電干憂，以致强度大為减退。所以不能像冬季之能稱為遠距離的季節。（完）</p>
<h3>意大利廣播電台</h3>
<p>— 蕭蓮</p>
<p>用十二種言語播音</p>
<p>意大利有七個無綫電廣播台用十二種語言以播送遊歷及經濟之消息。七電台是在羅馬，米蘭，巴里，杜侖，佛羅侖斯，脫里斯脫，及波爾珊那各地，所用的是英·法·德·匈·西班牙·保加利亞·世界語·阿爾巴尼·阿刺伯·羅馬尼亞及希臘等十二種言語七電台每晚播音時間共為五十八小時廿八分鐘。巴里電台每星期一次，由無綫電敎授希臘及阿爾巴尼兩國人讀意大利文。</p>
<h3>歐洲的無綫電收音機數目</h3>
<p>— 蕭蓮</p>
<p>全洲合計僅稍高於美國</p>
<p>據日內瓦國際無綫電播音聯合會的統計，一九三四年歐洲的收音機數目，較之一九三三年增加百分之十九，一九三三年末，全歐洲收音機的總數是一七，八八二，六六五具，一九三四年是二一，一九四，七九二具。</p>
<p>收音機數目與人口數目的比例算來，丹麥居歐洲首席，在丹麥一千人中平均有收音機一百六十具，英國次之，千人中有一四七，二五具。其餘的國家計：瑞典一一八，〇三具；荷蘭半一〇八，八六具；德國九四，二二具；氷洲九十具；瑞士八七，七五具；奧國七十八具，比利時七三，五二具；但　六三，九〇具；那威五四，八五具；捷克四七，一〇具，盧森堡四五·八三具；法國四一，九七具；匃牙利三九，一四具，意大利一〇，〇八具，西班牙八，九九一具，羅馬尼亞五，五九具，布加利亞一，四八具，最少的是希臘，每千人中只有十分之八具。</p>
<p>但是說到收音機實在數的多寡呢，則推英國居首席，英國全國所有的收音機達六，七八〇，五六九具，第二是德國，共有六·一四二，九二一具。法國一九三三年有一，三六七，七一五具，一九三四年一　而至一，七五五，九四六具。</p>
<p>可是全世界各國的收音機數目與人的比較，美國之數目最高，平均每千人中有收音機一六二，二三具，丹麥也不及。歐洲全洲的收音機總數，僅稍高於美國，因為美國一國的收音機的總數已達二〇七五〇，〇〇〇具呢。</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3>出版界往何處去</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>如認出版界不僅僅是白紙上　些油　，而是當時思想及文化情狀的反映的話，那末，我們不妨大胆地說，今日中國的出版界不僅是患「貧血症」，而是已將斷氣了。</p>
<p>中國「有內容的」出版界之發展，近百年來有幾個顯著的階段，便是：（二）康梁維新運動，（二）五四運動，以及（三）國民革命運動。第一個階段搖動了封建絕對主義」的基礎，第二個皆段引發了民族自决的要求，第三個階段，也是最重要的階段，開展了民族獨立的反帝鬥爭。但是最後的一個階段，沒有多少成効，現在早已消沉。</p>
<p>如以為「書店」是出版界的中心，以「書店」的變動來觀察出版界的趨向，那未，更足以表現今日出版界的奄奄一息。在一九二七年左右，活躍於出版界的書店，有百分之四十以上，巳經不復存在。即使仍能支持至今的書店，性質也已「非復舊觀」。在新書業中具有歷史地位的幾家，如新生命書局，今日已失去了「新生命月刊」，甚至「社會與敎育」時代的光芒，，開明書局已喪失了「新女性」時代的前進精神；神州國光社已找不到一些「讀書雜誌」時代的力量，北新與現代也沒有了「推進新文藝的發展」的作用。此外尚有幾家，如華通。犬東等，在歷史上固無何種貢獻，而今日在「出版」方面，已呈停頓之狀，自更無足論。</p>
<p>但是，這並不是說：今日的出版界連「白紙上塗油墨」的都巳絕迹，不過，就是在出書的「數量」上，也已滅少。號稱文化街的上海四馬路上幾家書店。「照常」出版新書的，祇有商務等幾家，有幾家雖仍間有新書出版，而為數已不如以前的多。此外則差不多都已入於停頓狀態。</p>
<p>即就這些新出版的書來說，究有些什麼作用呢？我們可由其「數量」中來分析其質量：</p>
<p>（一）敎科書——還是競爭最烈的目標·如最近敎部新將各級師　課程標準公佈，各書局莫不抖擻精神，大事競爭，如商務·中華·正中·開明·黎明·大華等都在鬥心鈎角，積極進行。</p>
<p>（二）古書——太多了。資本雄厚的大部翻印，較次的則也退而求其次。如商務的叢書集成，開明的二十五史等，都是「亭子間的文人」沒有地方安置的巨書，其次如好幾家爭印的「袁中郎集」等，也都是不要稿費的「國粹」。</p>
<p>（三）舊小說——舊小說也是「古書」的一種，不過在一般正人君子如古直先生等看起來，究不能和「十三經」等相提並論。舊小說的翻印開始很早，即所謂標點小說；而現在却大走紅運，除了文化圖書公司等的「一折八扣」的不　外，幾家大書局也競印舊小說起來。「合購十部，大洋四元」的三國志。紅樓夢等翻印本，成了世界書局近日來的利市賣買。幾種舊曲詞話佔了生活書店的世界文庫之巨頁篇幅。</p>
<p>（四）圖晝雜誌——數量很大，為這一階設出版界的特色，幾家雜誌公司因之成立。內容是給姐兒爺兒們坐在「蘇乏」上看看怪有趣的春色，健康美，人體藝術，以及許多不能沒有「影星」及「舞星」的東西。</p>
<p>此外，是的，此外還有什麼，除了一些「怎樣種菜」。「怎樣造屋」，以及「怎樣算帳」的書籍？（如商務的每日新書，都不過是些基礎技術科學的書，兒實書也已過時了。）是則，這些東西對於新的思想與新的文化之推進，究有些什麼作用呢？</p>
<p>於是，有許多批評者高聲疾呼，什麼各書局不應該出版中國古書啦，應該出版西洋古書啦，應該多出哲學科學的書啦，應該，應該，「第三個還是應該。」實則造成今日出版界這種現狀的，有其各種現　　　　不是應該　應該的理論問題所能挽救過來。</p>
<p>造成今日出版界這種局面的原因，除了政治環境以外，最重要的是經濟關係。經濟衰落不但造成購買力的减低，而且也可促進思想的苦悶，無心於讀書。為了這樣，於是各書局的參考書都成了廢紙。就是在上海，號稱文化最發達的地方，不但各校學生大多不讀參考書，敎授大多不看參考書，就是一般文人，著作家，其所寫的書的數量也有超過其同時間所讀所看的。在內地，不要說是在農村，就是在都市中，就筆者近日所到的長江流域幾個商埠，中產以上的人民都在鬧恐慌，化一元買一本書是很少見的事，所以，如在九江蕪湖等處，就是商務中華等幾個大書局的分館，其日常至要的營業也祇見數角數分的賣買，市上所見的無非是一拆八扣七扣的東西。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，怎能不逼各書局走上今日的路。他們出版敎科書，他們知道祇要有學校，總有些銷路。出古書，他們知道至少有些圖書館及收藏者還有一些購買力。出版舊小說，因其讀者對象最廣，而且「大魚吃小魚」，至少那些舊的石印書及書攤的生意是可以搶過來的，圖畫雜誌性質也相類似。</p>
<p>但是，就是站在書局本身的立塲來說，今日的處境雖已困難，而也是不能維持長久的。譬如課本，競爭結果必為大的書局所獨佔，如敎部及國立編譯館的編印各級課本計劃成功，這路即將斷絕，古書雖有一部份圖書館及收藏者的惠顧，但這市塲極狹，而且衹有减縮，沒有開拓的。湖家書局如以舊小說及圖畫雜誌作為營業主目，則其事實上已不屬於新書業範圍，更無論此路也是不能持久的，因為舊小說的數量不能有新的增加，老是這末幾本，大家競爭的結果，必然是同歸於盡。</p>
<p>今日中國的出版界究往何處去呢？但是在這國民經濟總崩潰之時，沒有去路的，實不止出版界，各種事業都是這種情形啊！</p>
<h3>「社會鬬爭通史」</h3>
<p>— 李建芳</p>
<p>畢亞著　神州國光社出版</p>
<p>——讀史筆記之一——</p>
<p>社會戰爭通史為德國學者Max　Beer著。書分五券。後二券在　　　　　　　　　　漢民從日文譯出，由民智書局出版。神州國光社譯本是葉啟芳由美國H．J．Stenning出版的英文本譯出的。照譯者的申明，英文本是由原作者親自校對過的。因此這版本當是十分可　的。</p>
<p>葉譯第五卷上有胡漢民的一篇長序。由這序的內容雖可以看出今日的胡氏與昨日的胡氏精神趨向之不同，但一般的說，序言的作者仍備極推崇本書「內容引證極宏博，編排極精審，叙述極深刻。』至於葉君，他不獨深佩畢亞『知識之廣博，論斷之謹嚴，觀察之深刻，和參考書之豐富，』甚至還發現了原作者『章之流麗和叙述之活潑。』</p>
<p>由這兩大譯者的介紹與推崇看來，我們即在未讀本書以前，也可以想見本書之價值了。</p>
<p>的確，本書確有牠的相當的價值，這價值是甚麼？這價值表現在原作者當大戰後欲積極的脫離社會民主黨右傾傾向而轉向到革命，表現在原作之一貫的戰　唯物論精神上。胡漢民在二次革命前夜之所以來介紹這部書，正是表示胡氏當時因矢意而欲重新引起靑年的同情。胡氏的現序思想與前序之所以不同者，正足以說明胡氏前後心理之矛盾。</p>
<p>雖然畢亞這部象徵自己精神轉變的著作帶有濃厚的革命氣分，但它能否稱得起是一部歷史傑作呢？不能。畢亞的轉變是值得稱述的事情，但他的歷史素養可遠不及德國的麥林格科諾夫和考茨基等。不，畢亞的著作簡直不能儕於後者之羣。</p>
<p>畢亞的著作只能算是歐洲的物觀歷史派的三四等的作品。决不能說是二等的，更决不能設是頭等的歷史作品。過分地推崇這本書，在胡氏是因當時另有作用，在葉君就不免表現他太沒見過歷史傑作了。</p>
<p>放下每卷每章那些瑣細的缺陷不談，且對本書最主要的缺點加以指示吧。這或者比盲目的推崇本書對於讀者更有意義。這有兩大缺陷，即第一，沒有中心。第二，沒有基於階級眼光的分析能力。</p>
<p>先說第一個缺陷。本書題名為『社會鬬爭通史。』顧名思義，牠應以社會變革運動為牠的研究對象。至社會思想的發展和鬬爭只在叙述　　　　　　　　　提到，萬不能把這兩項等量齊觀地加以排列叙述。等　　　　　　　　叙述，就不免使本書變為非軀非馬的產物了。</p>
<p>其次，所謂社會鬬爭，它不僅是包括古代和近代的無產者的鬬爭，而且也包括古代和近代的有產者和封建貴族的鬬爭。但嗶亞這部書並沒有盡這一叙述任務。他的書，有時看來，像是在研究一般的社會鬬爭史，有時候，又像是僅是研究特種的社會主義鬬爭史。畢亞在講希　羅馬社會鬬爭時，對於希臘羅馬的共和國運動完全沒有講到。在講近代社會鬬爭時，雖以專章來講法國大革命，德國革命，但他對於更早的尼德蘭革命，英國革命，和意大利統一等都沒有講。豈是因這些事件不值研究麼？不是，乃是由於畢亞的著作常常失去中心。</p>
<p>醫如本書的第二卷，中世紀的社會鬬爭史，作者只是零零細細講了一套，而對於中世紀的社會和國家之特質一點也未講到。第三卷，講中世紀末的社會鬬爭，按歷史運動的脈搏說，他一開始應對中世紀末城市與公社的鬬爭加以閘述，其次是行會的學徒與老板的鬬爭，其次，是中世末的農民暴動，作者是應該而必然要這樣去分配他的研究。但作者却不如此，作者在把幾個主要的農民暴動加以叙述之後，即把全卷的重要篇幅都用到烏託的思想叙述上去了</p>
<p>總之，全書沒有中心，這是本書第一個根本缺陷。</p>
<p>現在我們要說本書的第二個根本缺陷，即作者沒有分析能力。</p>
<p>在歷史上不同極類的思想運動，照例表現着極不相同的歷史利益。柏拉圖的共和國所代表的歷史利益决不等於司巴達卡斯運動所代表的歷史利益；而傳利葉聖西門西斯蒙特的社會主義所代表的歷史利益，决不等於馬克思的社會主義所代表的歷史利益。因此，我們叙述社會主義的歷史發展時，一個中心的任務，是在分析各家社會主義思想之社會階級的特質。要分析各種類似的社會主義之不同的社會特質，只有從分析各時代的生產方式和社會關係着手。</p>
<p>但畢亞在講述各家社會主義思想時，他全然沒有做到這一層。他的叙述，奧其說是分析，不如說是含混不淸的材料的堆積。這一根本缺陷，全然是因為畢亞在生活上不是，一個實際的社會　爭　　　思想上　種形式思維方法所至</p>
<p>這是本書的第二個根本　缺陷，形式思維方法所致</p>
<p>然不則本書就不值得一體麼？是又不然。本書雖不是物觀歷史派的頭等著作，但畢竟是有它的相當價值的。而且以本書去比威爾斯的世界天網，其價值更高出萬倍；不過神州國光社會把這樣一種普通的歷史作品定價到三元五角，就未免太只圖賺利，而沒有想到一般讀者的驟買力了。</p>
<h3>向樊先生提出二點意見</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>前一期樊仲雲先生在本刋發表一篇「與室伏高信論中日兩國知識分子的結合」，讀後覺立論甚為正當。樊先生非常同情於室伏高信先生「中日兩國知識分子應卽結合起來」的主張，以為「為了中日兩國及人類文明的將來，在這時候，中日兩國為求彼此的深刻理解，其知識分子的結合，實有非常的必要。」這見解是十分對的。然我們覺得樊先生的話，其中尚有二點，是很值得提出來討論的。</p>
<p>第一，樊先生論中日關係，有一段是這樣說：「無論日本單獨的力量，不足以排除中國，卽令能之，試問世界列强能坐視日本勢力的發展乎？自九一八事件以來，在中國固是遭遇了空前的國難，可是日本為什麼也是國難，是所謂非常時期，而叫出危機一九三六年的呼聲來呢？卽此一點，便可知彼此的爭執，是只有使中日兩國，交受其害了。」世界列强不能坐視日本勢力的發展，從前我們也相信這句話。但現在却不然了，現在我們巳明白這是一種錯誤的認識。因為自東北失陷而後，我們已看見我們相信為不能坐視日本勢力發展的世界列强，却正在那裏坐視日本勢力的發展。這不是一伴很明顯的事實，足以打破我們的迷夢嗎？至若說九一八以來，中國喊出國難的呼聲，日本也喊出國難的呼聲。要知同是一聲國難，中國的國難，和日本的國難，情形是完全兩樣的。我們倘因此便認為是中日兩國交受其害，那就很錯了。</p>
<p>其二，樊先生向日本一般知識分子提出一個問題，謂：「日本當前的敵人，究竟是中國，還是其外某一國家呢」？我們以為樊先生這一問是多餘的。蓋日本當前的敵人，究竟是那一國，這可以不必管。我們惟知道日本一向之對待中國，並不將中國視為敵人，而是把中國當為一個發展的目的地。老實說，中國今日遠不配作為日本的敵國，像美國或蘇俄一樣。</p>
<p>最後，我們覺得中日兩國知識分子的結合，誠然可以促進彼此的深刻理解。但中日間的糾紛，並不能因此獲得解决，還須於別種方法中求之。　　　問題的　算，實不如此筒單而容易也。</p>
<p>行安先生大鑒：尊論甚是。但由東亞均勢的破壞，列强各國不甘從此罷手，則我以為是很明白的事。不過現在因彼此間的糾紛，尚未得到一致，故不能起而淸算耳。總之，國際形勢變化多端，目前那種局面，决不是一成不變者。至中日糾紛之解抉，當然須求別法，惟自己沒有實力，恐一切都不過空談，無補於事也。</p>

<h3>發刊談話</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>近代衛生的重要，已為一般人所重視了，往昔因為敎育的不普遍，所以國人對於醫藥的常識，根本缺乏研討，自五四以後，民族智識漸開，並且知道衛生及醫藥常識的需要，但除却一般智識階級之外，尙不能謂是普遍而大衆化，本刊同人，卽為適合一般國人之需要，及灌輸新醫藥的知識起見，特借本報這一角地，來盡我們的責任，然而我們知道這偉大的工作，决難勝任，故同時希望醫藥界的同志，時刻的不吝賜敎，來共同扶助這小小的一角地，使它成為社會上一個健全有益的刊物，這是我們所最希望的，本刊的立塲，巳如上述，但本刊剛纔產生，對於內容當然不能如理想那般的使人滿意，嗣後閱者如有意見及醫藥上的討論，本刊一樣的熱烈歡迎，務使我們達到服務社會，使衛生及醫藥常識大衆化的宗旨，</p>
<h3>慢性胃加答兒（慢性胃炎）</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>慢性胃加答兒在臨床上時有發現。其所以如是者。皆因本病多為續發性也。尤以在胃潰瘍胃癌胃擴張或心肺肝口腔等疾患後而續發之。至於自家中毒者雖有而不多見也。此外亦有特發性者多由於患者飲食之不攝生而起。如咀嚼不足。急速呑嚥。或强有力過量之烟酒刺戟食物。甚或因牙齒不健全者亦足發病。</p>
<p>在病理解剖上可見種種變態畸型。如胃體肥厚。甚或縮小而成胃萎縮症。</p>
<p>在病者自覺症候。有胃部膨滿上腹部壓痛及重感。尤以粗硬食物攝取後著明。其他如糊樣之淡味。食慾缺乏或錯亂。口渴舌苔。並有惡臭及酸性噯氣。嘈雜惡心。欠伸。流涎。嘔吐。睡眠因之不良。頭重。全身倦怠。就業嫌忌。胃因異常醱酵而生瓦斯。此外因胃神經之刺戟。發劇烈頭痛眩暈恐怖等症。心臟間接受其影響而發生喘息心悸亢進不正脈。其他因鹽酸Pepsin之缺乏。食物常不易消化而停滯胃中。故大便多呈秘結尿量减少等。</p>
<p>本症在臨床上由胃液檢查結果可分（一）單純性慢性胃炎（二）粘液性慢性胃炎（三）酸性及過酸性慢性胃炎（四）减酸性慢性胃炎（五）無酸性慢性胃炎（六）萎縮性胃炎等六種</p>
<p>其在診斷上與胃潰瘍鑑別較為容易。如激痛起於食後一定時間。壓痛點之存在及出血等。均為胃潰瘍所特有。與胃癌初期殊不易鑑別。但依照息者自覺症狀。再行朝食檢査。視其胃內粘液量之多少。游離鹽酸之定性量酸酵素之消化力如何。此外更用X光檢視從中幫助之。當易診斷也。</p>
<p>對於治療方面有種種。如食麥理學鑛泉及藥物胃痛靈等治療。如患者能遵從醫師之規定和忠吿。當不致陷於預後不良也</p>
<h3>余服升殖素之經騐</h3>
<p>— 李松林來稿</p>
<p>余因腎虧之故，神經異常衰弱，最感痛苦者，厥為精神之不足，辦事恒感畏縮，且耳嗚目眩，頭昏腦脹，四肢乏力，腰痠背痛等諸虛百症，無不患遍，雖年祇念四，而衰老不虛老人，靑年所具之生氣，消滅迨盡，中西醫求治無數，亦難見效，痛苦之深，實難言表，數月前偶於途中逅邂前同窗知友王一嗚君，數年闊別，王君丯采依然，反顧自身，羞慚莫名，王君亦詫而相詢，余卽將所患相吿，彼云有生殖素一藥，為治君病之唯一良劑，蓋一試之，余初尙不置信，然良友見吿，當不欺我，姑且試之，服後果出余之意料，神淸氣爽，精神大振，連服月餘，余終身之痛苦，得以解决盡絕，誠希世聖藥也，</p>
<h3>治白帶應用療帶靈</h3>
<p>— 程竹筠女醫師</p>
<p>余每於治療婦女白帶病時，療帶靈往往成為一非用不可之藥物。蓋其不僅具有獨出之殺菌功能。而且能於患者膣中發生一種有益之化學變化。不揣胃味。敢為一述余之經騐。（一）該劑係以優良之乳酸菌經人工培養而成。用時能發生一種乳酸。使塍內之檢性分泌物變為酸性。以保持　生理之健全。扶助有益的　桿菌之繁殖。（二）能消滅浸入之病菌。淸退濃性分泌物，消失外陰部之刺戟疼痛及漁潤靡爛等徽象。用以治療赤白帶下，子宮頸管炎，子宮內膜炎，非淋毒性　炎，淋病後之分泌物過多等症，均有出入意表之效力。余自得用此藥。實不管給余於臨床上一莫大帮助也。（按療帶　上海華美藥房有售每瓶二元四角）</p>
<h3>遺精之痛哭</h3>
<p>— 何中眞來稿</p>
<p>余係閩人，年廿三歲，僑居滬上已八載，幼時肄業故鄕某校時，受同校劣生之引誘而犯手淫，後吾父經商來滬，余亦考入本埠某中學，惡習仍未稍改，每夜必行，及後身體日漸衰弱，面黃肌瘦，視力短縮，至此方悟其害，立卽戒絕，而遺精卽接踵而起，初尙月遺二三次，及後七八次甚至十餘次，且無夢居多，因之凡頭昏腦脹，神經衰弱，精神疲乏，四肢軟痲，腰背痠痛，健忘，失眠，心悸，耳嗚，食慾减退等病徵，莫不患遍，雖經數度醫治，終鮮效果，因循至今，已達五年，痛苦備　，實難申述，今春偶見報章，載有希米脫氏固精片治愈遺精患者之來函，余乃至正威藥房試購一瓶服之，果非虛言，連服十餘瓶，數年惡疾頓吿霍然，迄已四月未見再發，故特錄出，以為同病者吿。</p>
<h3>胃痛特效藥</h3>
<p>— 曹仲衡</p>
<p>胃病，為普通流行之病症，余卽患者之一，罹本病已十餘年，時發時愈，備嚐痛苦，當余胃病發作時，每痛至氣急涕淚，猶如裂肚抽腸，迥蕩於胸腹間，疼痛欲絕，雖屢次醫治，終因無特效藥品，不得根治，醫者咸感束手無策，余之健康亦日被摧殘，消化之機能，幾全為消失，人生之不幸，孰有過於此者，前月胃痛復發，乃亟至華美藥房購胃痛靈一藥，定價二元，為余前所未服過者，滿擬携回試服，於途中劇烈之疼痛忽發卽以該藥服之，未片刻疼痛停止，且胸襟舒適，功效之神速，令人驚奇，後續服數瓶，卽根本治愈，現飲食大增，消化暢快無阻，康健亦得恢復，特誌之藉作介紹，</p>
<h3>腎萎之正確療法</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>患者彭景淞。年二十八歲。松江人。十七歲便賦好合。當時年幼無知。未免放肆。性能因而受害。及二十歲忽患遺精。且時失眠。精神疲倦。四肢無力。胃呆不納。心跳耳鳴。當時旣未加以正確療法。亦不以其病為可怕。遷延數年。病勢日增。直至今春竟成完全腎萎。由其友盧君介紹來所。經余診察。實為腎虧。余乃囑其向正威大藥房購生殖素內服。共計歷時兩月。現在不但所病已失。且已生氣百倍。康健超羣矣。</p>
<h3>又一遺精患者</h3>
<p>— 陳震</p>
<p>余為僻處窮鄕之小職員，亦患遺精症之一人也，余之遺精，甚時月必廿次以上，巳達五年之久，且患極重之失眠，身體之虛弱，精神之萎頓，已趨極點，然因環境之不良，交通之不便，故身雖罹生命相連之病症，亦不得良醫以治，余之命運亦可謂酷矣，屢見每星期由滬運來之各報所載所刊，見諸同病者因服希米脫氏固精片而治愈之自述，實深涎羨，然千里迢遙，無法購服，深以為苦，適滬戚來函，云月後將返故里，因馳函囑其務必代購希米脫氏固精片一打帶回，果於其歸來時未失所望，亟服之，一夜酣然，使余不勝驚異，遺精固止，失眠亦愈，現一打服畢，健康恢復，不啻再造一身也</p>
<h3>遺精失眠宜服固精片</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>遺精失眠。固為人生康健之大敵。其起因多由神經衰弱。久而久之。不但神志萎靡及精神疲倦。且可引起抵抗力薄弱。而易罹病。食慾不振及消化不良。呈營養不足。如此苦痛。豈可忽視。故醫學界每多研究之。但出品雖多。而效騐卓著者。寥若晨星。自德國性病專家希米脫氏發明希米脫氏固精片以來。依余臨床經騐。確具大效。輕症服後二三瓶。即可完全解决。重症亦無不藥到病除。故余在臨診。如一遇此種患者。喜為介紹之。因其確為最靈騐之出品。實亦患本症之福音也。</p>
<h3>性病診療報告</h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌醫師</p>
<p>一.性能斵傷與遺精早洩</p>
<p>患者蔣某。二十八歲。本地人。商界。主訴——性感覺過敏。性神經衰弱。遺精。病歷——習業時受同伴引誘。引起手淫惡癖。接連四五年而不悟。致能斷傷。婚後尤不能人事。雖竭力進服補品。而體軀仍弱不勁風。去年十月前來請求治療。現在症——精神疲乏。作事無恒。時作無謂之焦思。或竟注然流涕。睡眠時夢魂不安。記憶力與判斷力均减退。脊骨疼痛。時有重壓感。大便不調。性神經呈虛性興奮。精神肉體。兩有痛苦。治療——首先着重內服藥。以希米脫氏固精片治其遺精。再以生殖素補其虛。一面復施用各種有效手術。越兩月而愈。愈後仍繼續服用生殖素半打瓶。據云其體壯已較前增加多多矣。</p>
<p>二.腎虧多病戒之在色</p>
<p>患者焦君。三十一歲。湖南人。政界。主訴——遺精。腎萎。久醫不愈。愈而不能持久。病歷——焦有寡人癖。妻妾滿室。放肆無度。廿四歲便起遺精。繼以早洩。廿九歲時。始成為完全腎萎。加以百病相襲。痛苦不堪。現在症——性神經由衰弱而麻痺。靑春腺衰老。腎部呈萎縮狀。性慾淡薄。隔日遺精。間有在白盡中失精者。精神因之恍惚。食慾亦第次减退。身體枯瘦如柴。治療——用斯丹那氏生殖素內服劑。促其內部發育。再以電波感刺局部。頻治頻愈。前後九星期。始恢復常人之健康。昨得其來函謂刻下家庭人事。無不處處滿意云</p>
<p>附啓　姚博士門診時間上午十時至十二時下午四時至六時星期六下午及星期日休息診所在四川路北京路轉角</p>
<h3>體虛腦弱之療法</h3>
<p>— 徐紀文醫師</p>
<p>患者范崇堯。廿五歲。湖北人。幼時每聽朋輩道及女性或見有關於異性之文字。即生種種幻想。而引起手淫習慣。至十九歲時。便覺面色蒼白。身體衰弱。百病亦隨之而起。腦弱，咳嗽，健　？腰背酸痛，意志頹喪。四肢無力。遇事畏縮。自念如此之身。終不敢言婚娶。然而高堂二老。抱孫心切。固無容聽其自然也。為此懇余為之治療。經余檢騐之後。發覺其性組織及內分泌已失一般常態。急投以各種補針。無效。後乃以斯丹那氏生殖素進之。服完三瓶。症狀顯退。未及十瓶。而體軀强壯。面色紅潤。靑春回復矣。</p>

<h3>暑假與寒假</h3>
<p>— 工</p>
<p>每逢學校寒暑假，開學和放假，我便要擔心事，因為開學必須為子女張羅一筆學膳宿費，放假則從二房東處秀下來的一些房屋，室小人多，頗不衛生，所以開學放假，交受其困。</p>
<p>我小時，讀學費旣極微薄，而一年中之放假時期，祇有清明，端午，八月半，年夜，一年之中差不多祇有一月光景，此種「死讀書」和「讀死書」的方法，確眞如撳住牛頭吃草，絕不相宜。</p>
<p>而現在的讀書，似覺過於寫意，費了偌大的學費，而一年之中，僅讀半年書，期間放假時期，除春假，星期，運動會，紀念日之外，還有寒暑假之長期放假，此種讀書，對於經濟時間，似沈過於浪費。</p>
<p>若謂暑期冬令，讀書不合衛生，美的精神，寓於美的體魄，卻也不差，但是亭子間的生活，是否宜於學堂中之衛生，且在此長時期的放假中，子弟能在家溫習舊課，或自修學業者，能有幾人，不是出外尋娛作樂，便是過睡多食，故長時時期的放假，約略言之，其弊有三：（一）校中學課，多半遺忘，（二）結伴閒遊，漸　墮落，（三）室狹人稠，易生疾病。</p>
<p>以上三端，雖未必子弟多是如此，并且富有者，決不至地狹人稠，但有以上情形者，必不在少數，可以斷言。故此種感想，非我一人之私言，實凡有子弟之公言也。但現在東西各國學制，大抵如是，我國學制，採自列強，應亦無可　議，并且此種主張，頭腦冬烘，與近代思潮，完全相反，因為現在這樣讀書，尚不免有「讀死書」之誚，假定現在還要加緊讀書工作，豈不為識者所譏。</p>
<p>其實不然，各國某種制度，行之頗收效果，但一採行於我國，卽變為枳，其事例原不可勝數，而代議制度之取消，亦其一端也，我國變法業已多年，而工業，經濟，生產，商業，事事落後，所以我國任何一種學問，事業，人一己百，人十己千，當虞不及，而專學外人之形式與皮毛，宜中外之不相及矣。</p>
<h3>新秋偶記</h3>
<p>— 譚曇</p>
<p>劈鈸這套玩意完畢後，和尚們又高聲的唸經了，觀眾們自然全部又回向道士據着壇那方去。當和尚劈鈸的時候，道士們知道觀眾們的心理，所以那時候戲做得極不起勁，直到和尚的鈸一劈完，他們放起勁起來。</p>
<p>道士們捲土重來的第一聲，是變衣：變衣是先拿一件有各種不同的顏色逐層制就的衣服穿在身上，手裹拿一幅加官手卷，依着各種樂器的聲音，在某一個適當的時期由幾個助手幫忙突然把穿着的衣服和手卷同時換了一個顏色，方法是和京戲中的加官換手卷一樣，并沒有一點奇異處，而我當時，卻最高興看這套。</p>
<p>衣變好，時候大概是已半夜了。年長一點的人和太小的孩子早已回家睡去，壇下站着的都是十三四歲到二十五六歲的大孩子。這時候我們幾個就互相把手緊握一下，或則輕輕的打一下，意思是互相招呼「注意，好戲就要開始了。」就在這時候，許多賣小食的人就走出來招呼我們，當時雖則很想吃東西，但是偏不馬上買，先四面看一看，把幾個平日已經知道他們要好的青年男子，記牢他們的方位，然後叫賣小食的人拿東西來吃。自然，吃的時候，是不會定心的，斜着眼釘着要注意的人物。</p>
<p>東西還沒有吃好，忽然有一個青年人突然從人叢中退了出去。我那時就死釘着和退出去的青年有關係的女子，同時更關照了我自己的同伴，果然不多一回，這女子也像破曉的星星悄然隱去，我們就急急的跟出去，躡手躡脚的不使前邊走著的人聽到。根據幾次的經騐，知道這種女子在走路的時候是一定頻頻回頭的，所以我們絕對不是直跟而定打斜的跟。</p>
<p>在這開醮壇約有半里之遙，一片高梁濃得純黑，她在高粱田外徘徊了一回，突然分開高粱進去了。我們那時幾乎笑起來，大家努力閉住了嘴，更輕的走近高粱田，但是那時到底膽小，互相對望着，不敢進去，沒有辦法，就大家蹲下各人握了兩塊泥塊，一聲不響的向高粱地拋去。</p>
<p>這一來，高粱田中突然跑出來四五個人拚命的向四方竄去，原來在此良宵，青年男女幽會的不止一對。</p>
<p>這時候我們自然勝利地笑了。</p>
<p>因為這些幽會的男女，都是自己的近鄰，所以即使在月色朦朧的夜晚，也清清楚楚的知道這是誰某那是誰某，我們牢記心頭，再回到醮壇下去看戲。醮壇情形已經完全不同了，人已經少得很，壇上蠟燭的蕊長得過份，沒有人去剪，所以燭光暗得出奇，和尚唸經聲也有氣無力，道士做戲，也沒精打彩。就是我們突然感到疲倦，急急的跑回家去敲門，養息第二天晚上再看的精神。</p>
<p>傳聞像流行病般的傳染，第二夜醮壇下除了評論昨天道士的戲外，更有議論某少女和某少年幽會的聲音。</p>
<p>我記得，我清楚的記得，我自從十三歲那年起參加這種野性而且快樂的偵獵，直到十六種離開家鄉為止。</p>
<p>流年忽忽，今年的七月十五，已經過去了。瓜果雖則不至吃不到，但這種快樂何時再遇呢？卽使回到鄉下也不能再去追尋舊了！（完）</p>
<h3>舅父</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>舅母來信說，舅父的腳氣病又發作了，今年可比往年要厲害，曾經有過兩三天不走路的。</p>
<p>舅父的病，每逢夏天都有過一陣劇烈的發作。這次居然累得舅母來信提及；而且，并細述病狀，他的嚴重性，是可想而知了。</p>
<p>他，是我素來崇欽而又恨惱的人。我崇欽他單靠一雙手，從世襲農家的環境中，打開了一條走入市儈商的路，外祖父常把這事引以為榮幸的；同時，我恨惱他那老氣橫秋的，自以為超人的態度。——時常對人家說，他自己怎麼地在困苦的生活中掙扎，奮力，怎麼地由「一脚牛屎一脚泥」的農夫階級，而爬到靠筆，靠腦生活的商人層上。</p>
<p>那一年，父親因為在事業上的失敗，我們的家境一時潦倒得不能打轉兒。為了省些開支，而且，父親要出門遠離我們去，貪得有個把男人家照料家務，曾經有過一個時候，我們和舅父他們是同住在一起的。</p>
<p>由於他的出身是混在貧窮的人堆里的緣故吧，他對於金錢，有着非常愛情的習性。因之，每每只顧省錢，忽略了因省錢所受到的損失。他的九歲大的兒子也在這樣情況而送掉了性命，而現在，十六歲的女兒也輟學在家。於是，吝嗇鬼這難堪的綽號，便暗暗加上他的頭上了。街頭巷尾，好理閒事的人，是那末地多，他們譏諷和嫉妒超手於他們　的人，輕視和嘲笑底於他們的。基於這樣的情形之下，舅父，在一部分人的嫉妒，以及在另一部分人的輕視，交織成的所謂「人情世故」的陷井中，便像中世紀時代，教皇為君主們加冕似的，多得了一個為人所踏在腳下的名字。正是，給人家踢了一脚，還不夠味，尚要受着暗地里藏了刀子一般的冷笑。……</p>
<p>他，因為是南方人，旣流浪到東方支加哥的都市來，生活在那里，一切日常所需，都要和言語不同，風俗習慣各異的人們接觸，當然處處受到人家的欺騙，有時，雖然明知上了當，但因言語隔膜，而免生更多的麻煩，便都息事寧人地，把苦惱深化在沒奈何的咀咒中。像淡淡的輕烟，起先是沈　的緊緊的一團，過後，就得在不能確定的時間和空間里邊消散了。然則，遣留下那盤聚在心坎上的苦澀的味兒，卻是永遠不能磨滅的。時常為了一點新的刺激，個的創痕，也跟着發酵了。於是，他咬緊牙根，輪起拳頭搥着腦袋：</p>
<p>「丟那——，要是天開眼，看得見我亞錦的一生為人，……唉，病猫也有發威的一天的。瞧着那——」</p>
<p>但有一點我是不能同情於他給人輕視的。生長在美麗的南國，當人家問起他南國的景物，他便楞着眼珠子，往往答非所問的牽引到別的不相干的東西上面。</p>
<p>我的表兄，受了他的薰陶，渲染，接受了他的產物。對於我的表妹在十六歲那年輟學在家，他贊同的最激烈。當時，舅父初有這個主意的萌芽時候，他的建議，像一支利箭似的，深深地貫穿了舅父的心，為他父親的主意建築了一個堅固的基礎。</p>
<p>有一次，表妹哭着對我說：</p>
<p>「現在是什麼時代！你看，我還得從父從兄，樣樣不論什么都說舊的好，新的壞，那麼他們不回到舊的時代去，而偏生在這應該是新的世界過活呢？那些十八世紀的頭腦，擺在現在飛着一樣的前進的世界面前，要是這樣的繼續下去，那種死氣沉沉的情況，教我怎樣的活得下去呵。」</p>
<p>她在學校里讀了幾年書，居然對於新的社會也懷着一知半解的熱望。然而，受個中等教育的表兄，腐化得到這地步，我眞是莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>舅父雖然對於錢是慳吝；可是偏又陷入於賭博的沉迷中。每次，輸了錢回來的神情，眞是教我疑心他會有自殺的的可能性。</p>
<p>「丟——，吃也不捨得多吃一點，却白白地　孝敬了那個干老子了！」</p>
<p>「………………」</p>
<p>此外，還有許多咀咒的怨語，良心的譴責。一次，兩，……次數多了，便感覺煩膩了。對於這些可笑的舉動，只有讓遺忘在腦子里把這些印象拿去。………</p>
<p>我所知道的舅父，便是這樣的一個人。</p>
<p>後后，在我十六歲那年，因為漢口大水，他帶了家小，在我們家暫住了幾個月。</p>
<p>這一回，我從他給於的印象中，却不像從前那般惡劣了。而反有一點憐憫他奔波了一生，到了暮年，還不曾享過安逸的清福的可苦惱。</p>
<p>人老了，火氣的灼焰也只得在沒奈何的境況中低頭了。</p>
<p>——是一只獅子，因為暮年的境況的潦倒，追憶著過往的光榮日子，太意着。深悔可寶貴的青春一去不復返。</p>
<p>舅母的信，我一起讀過三遍，覺得有一種悒　的味兒，和黃昏的暮　似的一樣，從心底，緩緩地把年青的心蒙蔽了。</p>
<p>不論什麼美麗的花朵，在盛開過之後，（色，香，儘情地顯露過了。）而後漸漸兒趨向凋殘的時候，沒有不為先前是愛好者的遺棄。</p>
<p>他年紀一天一天地老大，我想，他的患的病怕不會有痊愈的日子了。</p>

However, as I have been ill for over a month and my physical strength has greatly diminished, I am deeply concerned that my absence from duty will cause delays. I have repeatedly submitted requests to the Central Executive Committee and Chairman Lin of the National Government, earnestly requesting to resign, but these requests have not been approved.

<h3>Li Yizhi Discusses Situation in Tianjin; Yellow River Diverting into Canal to Enter Huai River Appears Inevitable; Although River Mouth Closing Measures Have Been Determined, Work Has Not Started Due to Lack of Funds; River Mouth Has Recently Expanded; Starting Construction Requires More Than One Million; Three Resolutions from Shandong River Mouth Closing Meeting</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, came to Tianjin for convalescence. According to his remarks, his illness has slightly improved after a week, and he will go to Beijing soon. He participated in the River Mouth Closing Meeting in Dongzhuang, Shandong Province. On the way from Kaifeng to Jinan, the disastrous situation was dire and shocking. The Dongzhuang meeting determined the river mouth closing measures, which will be the responsibility of the Shandong Provincial Government. The total cost of the project is one million, but the Commission only approved 300,000, which is far from sufficient. Due to the lack of funds, work has not started yet. The river mouth has recently expanded, and starting construction now requires more than one million. It appears inevitable that the Yellow River will divert into the canal and enter the Huai River, which is beyond human power to reverse. Disaster in northern Jiangsu is unavoidable. Regarding the fundamental Yellow River management project, I requested the government to allocate five million for disaster management, but this number has not been approved by the government. This year's water conservancy funds are only designated at a little over one million, which is not even enough for temporary measures, let alone fundamental management. Due to the lack of funds, even the proposal to test the yellow soil in Kaifeng has been abandoned. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The River Mouth Closing Meeting decided to dig a diversion channel from Dahouzai to Lao Hanzai, about twenty li long, which requires 600,000. The Provincial Government will be requested to requisition 900 large carts to transport materials to Lanfeng Station on the 28th. Telegrams will be sent to the governments of Hebei and Henan provinces, as well as various counties along the river in this province, to requisition 550 civilian boats to arrive at Dongbatou by a deadline for use. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The River Mouth Closing Meeting was held on the morning of the 23rd and resolved: (1) To send personnel to work with the Engineering Office to purchase the necessary materials to protect Lishengtun and the Jiangsu Dam, and to rush the maintenance project. (2) To request the Provincial Government to telegraph various counties along the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways to requisition 900 large carts, to gather at the stations in each county by the 28th of this month, awaiting transport to Lanfeng Station for use. (3) To request the Provincial Government to telegraph the governments of Hebei and Henan provinces and various counties along the river in this province to quickly requisition 550 civilian boats, to arrive at Dongbatou by a deadline. The River Mouth Closing Plan, in addition to closing and repairing the silted mouth to protect the Jiangsu Dam and the remnant embankment, decided to dig a diversion channel from Yaohouzai to Lao Hanzai, about twenty li long, requiring 600,000 yuan. Personnel will be sent to survey within days, and then construction will begin. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Plans to Reward Troops for Disaster Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in view of the fact that the troops have been continuously donating to the disaster relief efforts for this year's Yangtze and Yellow River floods, or engaging in defense and rescue of embankments, intends to reward them based on their merits in order to encourage them. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Yichang River Water Levels Rise Again</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The river water levels in the Chongqing-Yichang section have risen again, warning of autumn floods. The Han River is still receding and there is no cause for concern. The Flood Relief Association has stipulated that assistance will be given to the extremely poor as a principle, given the severe disaster and limited relief, and has announced to the public that personnel who act improperly in distributing relief will be severely punished. The Yangtze River Group of the Provincial Government's Flood Disaster Inspection Team has concluded its inspection of ten counties, estimating losses of over 90 million yuan. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Director of Canal Works Bureau Discusses Mistakes in Embankment Construction in Northern Jiangsu; More Than Ten Breaches in Northern Jiangsu Embankment Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Kong Lingrong, Director of the Canal Works Bureau, said that the embankment construction in northern Jiangsu was a major mistake in obstructing the water flow. The water level of Weishan Lake is 18 meters lower than the breach, and the embankment height must be the same to prevent the water from flowing in. However, with no outlet for the water, Fengpei in northern Jiangsu and Shan County and Chengwu in western Shandong will be completely flooded. The Huai River diversion project will also be destroyed, and the Jinpu and Longhai railways will inevitably be cut off. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, there were more than ten breaches in the embankment in northern Jiangsu, with no one to protect them. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tongshan Holds Emergency Flood Prevention Meeting; Decides to Request Commissioner Shao to Determine Defense Measures; Yellow River Water Floods into Mao Village and Hanzhuang Stations</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Tongshan Flood Prevention Meeting resolved on the morning of the 23rd to determine the county's plan for preventing the Yellow River from changing its course, awaiting the Commissioner's decision for implementation.

(23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River water continues to rise, and the flow of the Bulao River is rapid. The bridge over the Bulao River on the Jinpu Railway is being severely eroded. The water is overflowing its banks, and Mao Village Station has been flooded. On the morning of the 23rd, Yellow River water entered the station, with the water depth on the ground reaching one meter. Station employees have moved to the platform and are living in the open. People escaping the flood have also fled to both sides of the roadbed to avoid the water. According to a phone call from Hanzhuang at noon on the 23rd, the water level of the canal rose another two inches overnight, and both inside and outside the station were flooded. Railway staff also moved to the station platform to take shelter. The water has approached the side of the roadbed, three meters from the tracks. Fortunately, the Weizhuang embankment has a civilian embankment, and the water surrounds it, otherwise the embankment would have been flooded long ago. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Pizhou telegram states that the Bulao River water rose eleven centimeters yesterday, and the southern embankment in the Liushanzi area was infiltrated by water, with a 20-meter breach. Efforts are being made to reinforce the breach. The Feng County telegram states that the wind and waves were too strong last night, and the western embankment of Weishan Lake and the northern embankment of the East Branch River were damaged by the water, but they were repaired without incident. The Pei County telegram states that the water levels in Xiaosiduan, Gaoxiaohu, and Hu Zhai Lake have all risen, and the water situation in Longguji is becoming stable. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water situation in northern Tongshan continues to rise. The water flooding westward has reached the newly built embankment base, and the water flowing eastward along the river is flooding northward east of the Jinpu Railway. Both the third and sixth districts have been affected by the disaster. The breach in the Daiwutang west embankment has a very strong water flow, and villages have been flooded. Wang Gongyu is requisitioning civilian boats in Zhengji to rescue flood victims. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ziya River Swells; Civilians Rush to Protect Embankment Works</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level in the Dacheng section of the Ziya River has swelled, only six or seven inches from the top of the embankment. The West Embankment Works Association mobilized more than a thousand civilians on the 22nd to rush to protect the embankment day and night in the Huangcha embankment area. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pinghan Railway Undertakes Flood Prevention Project</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Baoding states that due to the flooding of various rivers south of Daming, which endangers the railway tracks, the Pinghan Railway has decided to allocate 30,000 yuan to undertake a flood prevention project in three sections, with 10,000 yuan for each section. The first section is from Beiping to Shunde, the second section is from Shunde to Ancheng, and the third section is from Ancheng to Hankou. Several thousand workers have been mobilized for each section. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Glimpses of the Disaster in Eastern Puyang</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Baoding states that in Puyang and Dongming counties, near the Shandong border in Linpuji, all seventeen villages in Chahua Village in the two counties were submerged due to the collapse of the Yellow River embankment, with water depths ranging from five to six feet. More farmland outside the embankment was flooded. In nine villages, including Lengzhai, only the ridges of the houses are visible, and residents have fled to the embankment.

Tada inspected the Japanese troops after exiting the station, then took a car directly to the Fuso Hotel to stay. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, he visited the Japanese Embassy, and at 4:30 PM, he met with Chinese journalists. He will visit our military and political authorities tomorrow morning. Tada will not stay in Beiping long and is scheduled to host a tea party for Chinese and foreign circles at the Japanese Embassy on the 24th.

<p>(Beiping) Tada said that regarding Sino-Japanese relations, he hopes that the governments and people of the two countries will work together. He believes that mutual happiness is the key. Although anti-Japanese sentiment in China will be difficult to eradicate immediately, if they work together and support each other, it will be easy to reach a point of peace and friendship. He believes that economic cooperation between China and Japan is beneficial to both sides, but all aspects, such as the economy, industry, and finance, must work to improve the situation, then cooperation will be hopeful.

<h3>US Senate Special Committee Established to Investigate the Silver Situation Pittman Appointed Chairman Request Treasury Department to Provide Materials on Silver Purchase Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) The special committee appointed by the Senate to investigate the impact of the US silver policy on the domestic market held its inaugural meeting today and resolved to request the Treasury Department to provide detailed information and materials on the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act. (22nd National Dispatch)</p>

This proposal calls for the following provisions in the Silver Purchase Act to be deleted: (1) 50% tax on profits from silver sales; (2) Silver is nationalized; (3) Silver exports require a license.

<h3>US Agricultural Adjustment Administration Announces 9-Cent Cotton Loan and Guarantees Cotton Producers Can Sell Up to 12 Cents per Pound</h3>
<p>(Washington) The government today announced a 9-cent cotton loan to cotton producers, while guaranteeing that producers can sell at 12 cents per pound. (22nd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Davis, Director of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, stated that 13/16-inch Low Middling cotton and longer fibers can obtain a 9-cent loan per pound. It is found that last year's 12-cent loan was applied to 7/8-inch Middling or better. Officials said that setting 13/16 as the standard this year will allow approximately 200,000 more bales of cotton this season to qualify for the loan than last year. As for low-grade cotton below 13/16, it will not be eligible for this loan. The 12-cent guarantee will be fulfilled by paying supplementary benefit money. An official said that the average price of 7/8-inch Middling cotton will establish the standard by which the government grants supplementary benefit money. Loans and benefit money can only be obtained by cotton farmers who sign this year's contract and agree to sign the 1936 contract. The announcement of the above measures disappointed and angered Southern senators. Peng Haide said that this method is very confusing. The President's failure to announce a direct loan of 12 cents per pound is a great injustice. The victory of Agricultural Secretary Wallace, Agricultural Adjustment Administration Director Davis, and cotton traders is evident here. Senator George said that President Roosevelt and Wallace have now succumbed to traders and the shipping industry. This announcement is very harmful to the entire cotton planting industry in the South. He will ask Southern cotton farmers not to sign contracts with the government. Officials said that this new method can enable cotton farmers to earn 700 million yuan in revenue from their 1935 ginned cotton harvest. It is found that the 1934 revenue was only 613 million yuan. The price that cotton farmers can obtain under this plan should be above 12 cents. For example, if the market price temporarily reaches 13 or 14 cents, farmers can sell their cotton. If the average market price falls below 12 cents within the four months before January next year, cotton farmers can still obtain supplementary benefit money payments. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration announced that President Roosevelt has approved this plan. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture released the second ginning report for the 1935 cotton season today. According to the report, the ginning figure before August 16 was 317,000 bales. It is found that the figure for the same period last year was 354,000 bales. It is also found that the first report released on August 8, the ginning figure up to August 1, was 94,241 bales. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) Today, the price of cotton futures plummeted by 3-4 yuan per bale. In other words, it fell by about 75 points or more per pound. The reason is that the government is implementing a 9-cent cotton loan per pound for 1935 cotton. Cotton speculators had previously expected that this year's loan would still be 12 cents, but they are now greatly disappointed. However, cotton economists and cotton merchant authorities believe that the measures announced by the government are very constructive. According to a New Orleans telegram, the cotton price there fell by 4 yuan and 5 jiao per bale, and then recovered by about 1 yuan in the near term. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Washington announcement of a 9.2-cent loan per pound for the 1935 cotton crop was welcomed by people in Liverpool and London. American cotton farmers can now sell their cotton through normal commercial channels, and the government will make up for the selling price, up to 12 cents. This move should loosen the tension in the existing cotton holdings and lead to greater transactions. The possibility of US cotton exports will also increase greatly as a result. In the past cotton season, US cotton was often in an unpurchasable position, but in the future, the United States can compete with other countries on a relatively unrestricted basis. New York brokers expect the cotton market to open 60 to 70 points lower, and the difference between the October and May contracts will also narrow. Market participants who had previously purchased futures based on the optimistic expectations of cotton senators may sell them off. Cotton senators are very dissatisfied because cotton farmers previously had a 12-cent loan plus a 2.5-cent benefit, but now there is only a 12-cent guarantee, and the benefit is also included. The Liverpool cotton market is weaker in the near term than in the long term, but although there are many liquidations, they are all absorbed. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Meningitis Epidemic in Japan 75 Deaths in Osaka</h3>

<h3>Prospect of the Next British General Election</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Since the last general election in Britain until today, four years have passed in a flash. According to recent telegrams, the next general election has been scheduled for October this year. The left and right parties in Britain are all engaging in major activities for the election competition. On the Conservative Party's side, preparations have actually been underway for some time. The second reorganization of the National Government in June, with Conservative Party leader Baldwin replacing MacDonald as Prime Minister, was precisely a move to reorganize the ranks and unify the front in order to increase electoral strength. Since 1931, although MacDonald has embraced the Conservative Party and fulfilled his task of stabilizing the gold pound and restoring budget balance, his political measures have not been entirely satisfactory. The opposition parties have been extremely critical of him, and even the most conservative factions in political circles and within the party have ostracized him. MacDonald's reputation has been declining amidst this double attack, and his prestige is no longer sufficient to serve as a rallying point. Moreover, many of his policies have been criticized. The Labour Party's unprecedented victory in last year's London municipal council election can be seen as an indication of the people's inclination. The Conservatives, in order to prepare for the future, had no choice but to stand ready for battle. As a result, the post of Prime Minister could only be entrusted to Baldwin. After Baldwin took office as Prime Minister, MacDonald was placed in the idle position of Lord President of the Council. Simon was transferred to Home Secretary. The National Government is still nominally the same, but the reality is different. Previously, the cabinet still possessed a degree of unified spirit, but now the important figures of the Conservative Party have been placed at the forefront of the cabinet, giving the Conservative Party full control of political power. The meaning of this is nothing more than to facilitate the struggle against the opposition party. In the next general election, the decline of the National Labour Party and the Simon faction of the Liberal Party can be foreseen. The Conservative Party's elimination of MacDonald and Simon was inevitable. So why does the Conservative Party still appear in the next election in the formation of the National Government? The reason is that they want to absorb votes from voters outside the party in the election campaign in order to win an absolute victory. Therefore, in order to increase the number of candidates from the Simon faction of the Liberal Party and the National Labour Party, they are even willing to have some Conservative Party candidates give up their candidacies. Currently, the Conservative Party has a political advantage, which they are taking advantage of. They have strong financial resources to support their activities. They have two small parties as their wings. They have a policy of restoring economic prosperity as their rallying cry. Their position is indeed not weak.</p>
<p>In the general election, the only party that can compete with the Conservative Party is the Labour Party, a stronghold of the opposition party. The Labour Party has been making plans to regroup and make a comeback for the past three years. Although Labour leaders such as Lansbury and Henderson are somewhat lacking in prestige and are not sufficient to serve as rallying points, if a left-wing alliance can be formed, with the former Prime Minister Lloyd George, known as the Welsh magician, as its leader, and with a new policy platform as a rallying cry for the election campaign, then the position of the left-wing united political party will also be extremely strong. In the next general election, who will win is still unknown. The only unknown is whether Lloyd George's proposals can gain unanimous support from the Labour Party. Although Lloyd George has the support of the right-wing Labour Party, his proposals are still considered by the left-wing Labour Party to be unfavorable to workers. Moreover, since Lloyd George is using his new policy as the election platform in the next election and is uniting with the left-wing as his party, then a victory in the general election will still appear in the form of a united cabinet, with him serving as Prime Minister. Whether this proposal can be agreed to by the Labour Party is still a question mark. If a left-wing alliance cannot be formed, judging from the current situation, it is feared that the Labour Party in opposition will also find it difficult to win.</p>
<h3>On the Italo-Ethiopian Dispute Britain and France Work Closely British Cabinet Resolves to Notify the French Government to Abide by the Obligations Under the League of Nations Covenant Avert War Through Diplomatic Negotiations Arms Embargo Temporarily Maintained</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet meeting to discuss the Italo-Ethiopian dispute lasted five hours and adjourned at 4:30 pm. As the cabinet members left the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, the crowd outside gave them sincere salutes. Lord Privy Seal MacDonald said, "We have quietly, calmly, and coldly decided our position. Our minds are very clear about what we should do." The other cabinet members declined to comment. Regarding the situation of the meeting, no formal announcement was issued as expected. According to responsible sources, Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden gave a detailed report on the proceedings of the Paris Three-Power Conference, and then the Cabinet considered various issues related to the case.</p>
<p>The Cabinet highly approved of the resolutions of the British and French governments in Paris, that is, the two countries will continue to maintain contact and work closely together, and on the one hand, explore the possibility of seeking a peaceful settlement with Italy, pending the convening of the League of Nations Council meeting on September 4. For the purpose of this exploration, the resolution made in July to temporarily suspend the issuance of licenses for the export of arms to Italy and Ethiopia will not be changed for the time being. This does not mean that this resolution must be maintained until September 4. It was also resolved that the British government's attitude towards the League of Nations and the Covenant, its policy has been repeatedly announced, and there is no reason to change it now. In this regard, the Cabinet cited Foreign Secretary Hoare's words in the House of Commons on July 31, "We are well aware of the obligations of all treaties and the League of Nations Covenant, and we are determined to maintain them."</p>
<p>There will be no further developments in the next few days. The Cabinet has not scheduled another meeting. Some cabinet members will stay in or near London so that they can be gathered at any time. A few cabinet members will resume their holiday trips. Prime Minister Baldwin has returned to Aix-les-Bains tonight, and MacDonald is scheduled to fly back to Lossiemouth tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters learned that there is currently no reason to speculate that the League of Nations Council meeting on September 4 and the League of Nations General Assembly on September 9 will not proceed according to the usual procedures. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Before Lord Privy Seal MacDonald flew back to Lossiemouth today, he chaired a Cabinet meeting. They are now staying in or near London in order to deal with any incidents arising from the resolutions of yesterday's emergency Cabinet meeting. Today's meeting was still held at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, lasting two hours and fifteen minutes. Attendees included Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Hoare, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, and Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha. The resolutions of yesterday's Cabinet meeting will be communicated to the French government through the usual diplomatic channels today, or by Foreign Secretary Hoare personally to the French Ambassador to Britain, but it is not intended to notify Italy. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet has resolved on two methods for the Italo-Ethiopian issue: (1) Britain is determined to once again avert the Italo-Ethiopian war through diplomatic negotiations; (2) How to deal with Italy if it is willing to start the war. The Associated Press learned today from reliable sources that the British Cabinet has considered the following issues: (1) The issue of the movement of the Mediterranean and Red Sea fleets; (2) The issue of increasing the number of British defense forces in Sudan and Egypt; (3) The issue of lifting the arms embargo on the Ethiopian army; (4) The issue of reallocating British troops in Palestine to deal with unexpected events; (5) The issue of accelerating the expansion of the air force; (6) The issue of increasing shipbuilding. (23rd National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Thinking of Delaying Methods to Avoid the Immediate Outbreak of War</h3>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers this morning all carried reports on the recent situation of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. A correspondent for the Morning Post in London said that Britain and Italy are now resuming the usual diplomatic channels and exchanging views. "We can now believe that the British government has authorized Foreign Secretary Hoare and Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden to find a way to mediate on their own before the League of Nations Council meeting on September 4, so that the conflict between Britain and Italy over the economic interests of Ethiopia can be eliminated." A correspondent for the Paris Echo in London believes that the British Cabinet has thoroughly studied the issue of sanctions. "What is noteworthy is that Sir Ellington, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force, was invited to Downing Street for a long period of consultation. The British government knows that it would be very difficult to implement sanctions without the assistance of the French naval and military forces." The correspondent also said that the British government is now very inclined to find a way to delay the matter and is willing to cooperate with France. "In diplomatic circles, it is believed that it is worth any price to delay the matter. Therefore, a method of delay is now being considered, which is that at the meeting of the League of Nations Council on September 4, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will issue a declaration stating the country's various dissatisfactions with Abyssinia, so that the case can be mediated again, or a report can be prepared and submitted to the Council for review. According to Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant, Italy cannot engage in war until a period of three months has been satisfied after this report is submitted to the Council. If this is not the case and Italy disregards everything, then the Council should consider implementing sanctions against Italy in accordance with Articles 15 and 16 of the Covenant." A correspondent for the Little Parisian in London said that the issue of lifting the arms export ban can be implemented after Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Hoare have agreed, without the need to seek the consent of the entire Cabinet.

<h3>British Fleet in the Mediterranean Ordered to Relocate to Egyptian Waters</h3>
<p>(Rome) It is learned here that a squadron of the British Mediterranean Fleet has been ordered to temporarily station in Egyptian waters in September and October. Therefore, this fleet will no longer be stationed near Alexandria and Port Said, but will be relocated between the Suez Canal and Ismailia. The British defense forces in Egypt have now left their camps and are heading to Port Said and the Suez Canal area. (23rd National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>France Greatly Relieved to Hear of the British Cabinet's Resolution</h3>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here were greatly relieved to hear that the British Cabinet had decided to adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The Morning Post expressed satisfaction in its commentary, saying that the British government had not decided to ask the League of Nations Council to impose sanctions on Italy on September 4, and knew that selling arms to future belligerents was not a good way to resolve disputes. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily maintain the arms export ban. Although future resolutions can be predicted, the British Cabinet has discussed new ways to reconcile the dispute. Therefore, if the governments concerned have the heart and good intentions, it is still possible to obtain a solution before September 4. (23rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French responsible parties are all very satisfied with the British Cabinet's resolution on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, especially the point that Britain and France will continue to cooperate.

People here now expect that the cooperation between Britain and France will first take the form of continuing to exchange views through diplomatic channels. However, the French government is, of course, willing to have further contact with the British government when necessary. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy Actively Engaged in Military Preparations Air Force Continues to Arrive in East Africa</h3>
<p>(London) The Italian authorities are currently making military preparations as quickly as possible. According to a Reuters dispatch from Rome, the number of ships sailing from Naples to East Africa this week has increased. Many believe that the Italian authorities, in view of the possibility that the British government may implement Geneva sanctions and blockade the Suez Canal, intend to complete military preparations as quickly as possible. However, it is still questionable whether Britain can obtain the necessary majority in the League of Nations Council meeting to implement this measure. It is heard that the Italian Army Staff has considered a plan to deal with this measure in advance. Yesterday, after an aircraft carrier carrying ten aircraft and eighty pilots sailed from Naples to East Africa, a squadron of bombers and reconnaissance planes, totaling twenty-four aircraft, was shipped from the port today. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Naples While the British Cabinet is meeting to consider the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the Italian aircraft carrier Miraglia, carrying five bombers and five reconnaissance planes, has sailed from here to East Africa, carrying eighty pilots and Italian Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff General Pinno.

<h3>Italian Newspapers Warn Britain: Sanctions are Equivalent to War; Will Defend Rights with All Efforts; Believe Diplomatic Negotiations are Futile</h3>
<p>(Rome) The decision of the British Cabinet to continue prohibiting arms shipments to Italy and Abyssinia was received here with great pleasure, as there were initial fears that the British government might decide to allow arms to be freely transported only to Abyssinia. The British government's decision to maintain its policy regarding the League of Nations was expected by the Italians. However, the Italians see the British government's continued intention to seek a solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute through diplomatic channels as "well-intentioned but useless." At the same time, the Italians view the warning of free arms shipments to Abyssinia and the blockade of the Suez Canal as genuine hostile acts towards Italy. An article by Gaida published in the Italian Daily newspaper stated that he had previously written a clear and amicable article to inform Britain of Italy's needs, to enlighten those who are reasonable. Now, he must speak again to inform those in Britain who advocate for peace, continuing by stating that sanctions are equivalent to war, and the actions of British newspapers advocating for sanctions are tantamount to engaging in warfare, fearing that this will cause the war in Africa to spread to all parts of the world, resulting in a destructive war on land, sea, and air. The resolute and courageous people who defend their livelihoods, work interests, and honor will surely act in anger, and so on. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Italian Daily recently published an article criticizing a section of British public opinion, calling them "extremists of pacifism, stubborn League of Nations zealots, and firefighters who set fires," also stating that "sanctions are no different from war." British newspapers are now demanding that the League of Nations and Britain take sanctions against Italy, such as allowing free arms shipments to Abyssinia and blockading the Suez Canal, and so on. These measures are hostile to Italy and violate existing treaties. Once implemented, they are no different from war. This is working for war, and the conflict may spread from Africa to Europe and even the world. "What Italy upholds is the right to honor, survival, and work, which the Italian people view as being as important as daily bread." The Italian Daily then responded to an article published by the London Morning Post the other day, stating that Italy does not harm the British Empire and hopes that Britain will not harm Italy either, which would be good. The conclusion is: "What the world should know is that Italy's actions will not be hindered by anything. If these actions are hindered and encounter the greatest difficulties, Italy will face them with greater determination and a more united spirit. Those British who act as firefighters who set fires, in the end, only increase Abyssinia's obligations to Italy, and the reasons for Italy's demand for a final settlement will become even more sufficient."

<h3>Abyssinia, Regardless of Age, Vows to Defend National Territory; Army Ordered to Deal with Contingencies</h3>

<h3>Constructing a Second Line of Defense Along the Franco-Abyssinian Railway; Enough to Resist Aerial Attacks</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The Franco-Abyssinian Railway Company, which runs from Djibouti Port to the Abyssinian capital, requested this week that the Abyssinian Emperor transfer the protection of the railway to French or other neutral countries, and withdraw the current Abyssinian guards on the railway, deeply fearing conflicts with the Italians after the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian War. The railway authorities took the opportunity to announce that a week ago, Abyssinian guards and Italian police had clashed near the Ferték station. Defensive measures have been taken on the section from Télédéga to French Somaliland, and a second line of defense has been built. This line of defense is more resistant to aerial attacks.

<h3>Italian Consul in Abyssinia Suffers No Serious Injury; Confirmed to be a Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound from Hunting</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The Italian Embassy recently issued a bulletin stating that after being wounded, the Italian Consul, Falconi, has regained consciousness and can speak. The circumstances of the Consul's injury are as follows: When Falconi was leading a camel caravan to his post in Debre Marqos, he left the caravan halfway and descended alone onto a small hill. He walked about several hundred kilometers, intending to find a suitable place by the river to have lunch. At that time, he used his pistol to hunt wild birds. After firing one shot, the mechanism was damaged and unable to fire again. Therefore, he put it back in his pocket, but accidentally touched the trigger, and the bullet fired automatically, causing the injury. The caravan heard the sound and went to rescue him. They walked for seventeen hours in the rain, intending to transport Falconi back to the Abyssinian capital. The local porters carrying him on their shoulders stumbled many times along the way, before encountering the doctors and Falconi's friends who came to meet them. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee today advocated replacing the Neutrality Act with a measure prohibiting arms exports until the end of February 1936. Chairman McReynolds of the Foreign Affairs Committee stated today that this compromise would be more satisfactory to President Roosevelt's proposal to the Senate Arms Investigation Committee to introduce a Neutrality Act, because President Roosevelt was not entirely satisfied with the Senate's proposal, as the President did not approve of the mandatory nature of the bill.

<h3>Central Berlin Hastily Building a Huge Building for the Aviation Ministry; Underground Cellars Can Avoid Aerial Bombardment; Construction Cost 150 Million Marks</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Here, the new Aviation Ministry building is being built, with a large number of workers working day and night, with few interruptions. The construction is proceeding surprisingly quickly. The new building is made of reinforced concrete and costs 150 million Marks. It is located between two major thoroughfares, and the original old buildings on the site have been demolished. Visitors are prohibited inside the construction site, and photography is not allowed even on the street. Moreover, there are National Socialist Party troops guarding it day and night. Therefore, there are various rumors about the content of the new building, which are difficult to verify. The roof is flat and made of cement, which can be used for airplanes to take off and land. There are also underground cellars, protected by armor. In the event of an air raid alert, all personnel and files can enter them. There are also extremely large garages in the new building. All telephone and telegraph lines are buried underground, so they will not be damaged even by the most violent aerial bombardment. As for the interior decoration, it is both very modern and very luxurious. After the entire building is completed, it will be like building a city for Aviation Minister General Göring in the center of Berlin. It is said that Göring also wanted to build a car road from the new Aviation Ministry building directly to the Tempelhof Airport, but because it would require demolishing many houses, the cost would be too high, so it has been abandoned.

<p>American Cotton: New York cotton market, today the price fell sharply due to the government's announcement of cotton loans. It fell about 80 British pounds at the opening. Although there were continued long-term futures liquidations later, the price trend was stable. Many cotton merchants welcome this government measure because it can create an open market and encourage cotton industry activities, especially benefiting export trade.</p>
<p>British Wheat: Liverpool prices fell due to long-term liquidations and sympathy with yesterday's American wheat market. At 1 p.m., the October futures price was 5 shillings and 6 pence, lower than yesterday's closing price by one pence.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market plummeted due to the announcement of American cotton loans. The spot price fell even more sharply than the futures price.

<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market fell by one cent at the opening, but soon rebounded due to wheat production estimates favoring the long side and optimistic statistical positions in Europe. The trend of miscellaneous grains was the same as wheat.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Southern Tour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>(20) National Basic Education Research Institute</p>
<p>The Guangxi Provincial Outline for the Six-Year Plan for Universalizing National Basic Education hopes to: (1) Establish the Guangxi Universal National Basic Education Guidance Zone and National Basic Normal School before February 1935; (2) Universally establish National Basic Schools in all villages (streets) throughout the province before July 1936; (3) Universally establish Central National Basic Schools in all townships (towns) throughout the province before July 1937; (4) Complete the first phase of National Basic Education, which lasts one academic year, before July 1938; (5) Complete National Basic Education, which lasts two academic years, before July 1939; (6) Complete the preliminary work of village (street) township (town) construction throughout the province before July 1940. The center for implementing National Basic Education is the Guangxi Universal National Basic Education Research Institute. The institute was established in January 1934, with the Director of the Department of Education serving as the Director of the Institute. Its activities include (1) investigation, (2) research and design, (3) short-term training courses, (4) guidance for personnel serving in rural areas and finding ways to assist them in further education, (5) editing teaching materials. The reporter visited the institute on the 13th, and the Director of the Department of Education, Lei Pei-hong, was also present. The institute's staff led the way to visit various departments. At that time, the third section chiefs and supervisors of various counties were undergoing short-term training. The instructors' lectures and the trainees' standing up to ask questions created a very serious atmosphere, which cannot be compared with merely superficially training a false reputation. A certain gentleman also explained in detail the implementation policy of national basic education and the progress that has been made, which is worthy of reference. He said that the National Basic Schools located in villages (streets) are called Village (Street) National Basic Schools, and those in townships (towns) are called Township (Town) Central National Basic Schools. Village (street) basic schools accept school-age children aged eight to twelve who have not yet completed their education and provide them with two years of basic education, with only four courses: Chinese language, arithmetic, work, and music. Those aged twelve to sixteen who have not yet completed their education are provided with one year of basic education. Out-of-school adults over the age of sixteen are provided with six months of basic education, with only two courses: Chinese language and arithmetic. Township (town) central basic schools continue to accept students who have completed their studies at village (street) schools and provide them with two years of continuing education. There are more than 25,000 villages in the province, and each village must have a national basic school. To date, the counties with the best performance have established national basic schools in 90% of the villages, and even the worst ones are around 50%. Therefore, in any case, it is hoped that national basic schools will be universally established in all villages throughout the province by the summer of next year to complete the second year's plan. All kinds of national basic textbooks are edited by the institute and printed and distributed to various schools by the Guangxi Provincial Printing Office. There are also nineteen experimental primary schools in Nanning for experimentation, etc. The institute has printed various books on national basic education, and the plan is indeed very detailed and rigorous. Amid the current widespread literacy education movement, it is also a good reference.</p>
<p>(21) Livestock Conservation Institute</p>
<p>Among the various emerging industries that the reporter visited in Guizhou Province, the Provincial Livestock Conservation Institute was the most interesting and beneficial to farmers. The Livestock Conservation Institute is located in the suburbs of Nanning, a twenty-minute drive by car. The building is magnificent and paved with the latest white porcelain tiles. According to the staff of the institute, the institute was opened in May 1934, with an opening cost of 200,000 Guangxi silver dollars. The regular expenses for 1934 were 85,000 yuan, the temporary expenses for 1935 were 50,000 yuan, and the regular expenses were 100,000 yuan. The director is Ma Minghai, and the American consultant is Luo Duo. There are four sections under it: general affairs, research, pharmaceuticals, and epidemic prevention. Livestock conservation begins with protecting cattle. There are many farm families raising cattle throughout Guangxi Province. Every year, about 10,000 head of cattle are sold out of the province. Yellow cattle are worth about 20 yuan per head, and water buffalo are worth about 30 yuan. However, countless cattle die from disease every year. It is estimated that the loss is at least 1 million yuan. Therefore, the provincial government pays special attention to this. Since its opening, it has been able to produce its own epidemic prevention drugs and send veterinarians to various villages to provide farmers with free injections of healthy cattle for epidemic prevention and to diagnose and treat sick cattle. Farmers were initially quite skeptical, but after the cure, and as cattle plague gradually decreased, they gradually understood and welcomed injections. It is estimated that after it was opened last year, cattle plague deaths decreased to 25%. It is expected that the goal of 50% can be achieved this year. There are currently five veterinarians, including one Filipino, one graduate of school 83, and two Chinese. As for the method of making epidemic prevention drugs, several healthy cattle that have been inspected and are completely disease-free are first raised. Then, they are injected with vaccine. After twenty days, the cattle's body becomes feverish and tearful, and finally they fall ill. At this point, they are killed, and their internal organs are used to make medicine. Killing one cow to make epidemic prevention medicine can protect 50 cows from cattle plague, etc. Then, they led the way to visit the cattle sheds. One shed was for completely disease-free healthy cattle, numbering several hundred. Another cattle shed was for cattle that had been injected with vaccine. One strong cow had already had tearing and fever, and the others had not yet changed. They also visited the latest cattle slaughtering truck. The room was paved with tracks. After the cow was killed and its useful internal organs were removed, the cow's body was driven into another room to be burned. There were also ice-making rooms and disinfection rooms. According to American consultant Mr. Luo Duo, before the institute was opened, the Guizhou authorities had invited Filipino veterinarians to Guizhou to treat cattle in various villages, but the results were not significant. He worked in the Philippine Bureau for six years to prevent cattle plague and wrote a special book. He was hired to come to Guizhou and began planning and creating the current institute. Its main purpose is to manufacture epidemic prevention drugs and send personnel to various villages to inspect and inject them to protect the health of cattle. Then, they will further train rural farmers on how to improve their cattle breeds. Finally, they will select and purchase Indian cattle to breed here to make cultivation more efficient, and milk, etc., will also have the best ingredients to provide people with nutritious beverages. Therefore, although a large amount of money has been spent, the invisible production has increased, and both the government and the people benefit. (Sent from Nanning on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Han and Li Telegraph the Central Government Requesting 1 Million for Dyke Closure Fees and Requesting the Paving of a Spur Line from Lanfeng to Batou</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, Li Yizhi, and all the personnel of the Dyke Closure Committee held a meeting in Dongzhuang to discuss the Dyke Closure issue. After the meeting, they returned to Jinan. The Dongzhuang meeting resolved to request the Central Government to allocate 1 million yuan for Dyke Closure work and to request the paving of a spur line from Lanfeng to Batou for transporting materials. Li and Han had telegraphed the Central Government en route. Before the Ministry of Railways approved the allocation of material transport trains, Kong Xiangrong first borrowed a train from the Longhai Railway. Therefore, Li and Han separately telegraphed Qian Zongze, the Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, requesting immediate allocation for transporting stone for the Dyke Closure. Han also telegraphed the Central Government separately, describing the inspection of the breach and estimating that it would not be easy to succeed without 3 million yuan. Shandong has no ability to raise the funds, and requested the Central Government to allocate the full amount. Furthermore, the Dyke Closure Committee held its third regular meeting today (August 21st). Chairman Zhang Honglie reported the proceedings of the Dongzhuang meeting and discussed the proposal to repair the remaining dam at Lisheng Tun. It was resolved to first draft a plan for discussion at the next meeting. The proposal to block the breach was resolved to wait for the Yellow River Commission to complete the measurement before drafting a plan. As for the proposal to protect the Su Causeway, it was resolved to purchase materials first and actively proceed. The following is a record of Li and Han's telegram to the Central Government:</p>
<p>(1) To President Kong of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Chairman Song Junjian of the National Economic Council, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance: We held a meeting in Dongzhuang today to discuss the Dyke Closure work and resolved to re-submit the previous request to immediately approve the allocation of 1 million yuan for Dyke Closure fees. It is now found that the Dyke Closure plan is underway, and the need for funds is urgent. We respectfully record the original resolution and telegraph it for your consideration. We earnestly request that the full amount be allocated as soon as possible to benefit the key project. This is our sincere prayer. Respectfully, Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>(2) To President Kong of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Chairman Song Junjian of the National Economic Council, and Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways: We held a meeting in Dongzhuang today to discuss the Dyke Closure work and resolved to pave a spur line from Lanfeng to the Dongbatou breach for transporting materials. It is now found that stone is the main material for the Dyke Closure. After transporting it to Lanfeng, it is still thirty Chinese miles away from the Dongbatou breach. If manpower is used, it will be time-consuming and costly, and we fear it will delay the key project. We respectfully record the original resolution and telegraph it for your consideration. We earnestly request that you approve our request so that the Dyke Closure can proceed smoothly. This is our sincere prayer. Respectfully, Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>(3) To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Chairman Jiang, and Acting President Kong of the Executive Yuan: We have previously telegraphed reports on the water situation and disaster situation of the Yellow River breach at Dongzhuang, Cao County. More than a month has passed, and the erosion of the breach is getting worse day by day. The water flowing out is flooding and has nowhere to go, and the disaster area is also expanding day by day. In order to urgently seek closure and save the catastrophe, we consulted with the National Economic Council and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to determine the Dyke Closure method. We requested the Central Government to allocate funds for the project, and the province established a Dyke Closure Engineering Committee to be responsible for the construction. It has been approved. We immediately followed the agreed-upon method and actively proceeded. However, before construction, a detailed survey and design must be implemented to avoid omissions. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, we personally led the engineers of the Dyke Closure Engineering Committee to the breach. On the 18th, we jointly inspected the situation with Chairman Li of the Yellow River Commission. We found that the water flow at the Yellow River breach was extremely fierce, taking up 80% of the river's flow. The main river only has 20% of the flow, and the water flow is slow, and the siltation is very rapid. It may dry up in a few days. Breaches 1, 2, 3, and 4 are silted up, and breaches 5 and 6 are connected, with a width of more than four li and a depth of one zhang to one zhang eight or nine chi. If the breach is not closed quickly, there is a risk of changing the river course. According to the preliminary plan with Chairman Li, the Dyke Closure project, based on the current situation, will not be easy to complete without 3 million yuan. At this time, the locality is desolate, and refugees are everywhere. Saving the dying and rescuing the drowning is already overwhelming, and there is no surplus to raise funds for the project. We are anxiously thinking day and night. In addition to submitting a separate report after the detailed Dyke Closure plan is drafted, we hereby telegraph to request your review and prompt allocation of the full amount of project funds so that materials can be purchased and construction can begin, and the dyke can be joined as soon as possible. If this great disaster can be avoided in the future, we will be fortunate. Approaching thunder, we cannot express the urgency of awaiting orders. Respectfully, Han Fuqu.</p>
<h3>The "Strange Westerner" Case is Tried in the Hubei High Court; Debate Has Concluded and Sentencing is Scheduled; Jiang Junyu is Escorted from Shanghai to Wuhan for Investigation</h3>
<p>Wuchang Correspondence: The "Strange Westerner," also known as the "Mysterious Westerner," Joseph Walton, previously colluded with Liu Suiyuan, Xiao Bingshi, Lu Haifang, and others to organize an agency to gather political and military secrets of China to report to the Third International. After the case was exposed, the Shanghai Garrison Command dispatched detectives on May 5th of this year to capture Lu Haifang. Subsequently, Lu surrendered and provided information, leading to the capture of the Westerner and Wang Moqing, Hu Kelin, Yu Ruiyuan, and others. Huang Weiyou, a woman involved in the case, also surrendered to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters. Jiang Junyu, the daughter of Jiang Zhiyuan, the assistant manager of the Shanghai Bank, was sent to the Garrison Command by her father. Because her involvement was relatively minor, she was released on bail. However, the main criminals Liu Suiyuan and Xiao Bingshi are at large. The Garrison Command investigated and found that Liu had been living under an assumed name in the Chen Wenlu family's residence in Wujia Bridge Lane, Suzhou. By the time of the arrest, Liu had fled to Taiyuan with Chen Wenlu. Only Chen's younger brother, Wenjie, was captured. Another person named Yuan Shu also surrendered. The initial breakthrough in this case stemmed from the capture of Lu Haifang's younger brother, Lu Dubu, by the Military Affairs Commission's Headquarters in Wuhan. Therefore, the Shanghai Garrison Command transferred all the suspects to the Hubei High Court for investigation. The "Strange Westerner," Joseph Walton, was originally detained in the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Because his nationality was unclear, the Hubei High Court also extradited him. The woman Huang Weinuo was escorted from the Capital Police Department. Except for Yuan Shu, who was prosecuted first and sentenced according to Article 6 of the Emergency Criminal Law of the Republic of China and sent to the Rehabilitation Center, Joseph Walton, Lu Haifang, Huang Weiyou, Wang Moqing, Hu Kelin, Yu Ruiyuan, and Chen Wenjie were prosecuted separately under Article 5, Paragraph 2, and Article 4 of the Emergency Criminal Law of the Republic of China. The First Criminal Division of the High Court scheduled a trial for the 21st of this month. At 9:00 AM that morning, Judge Zuo Jingchang, Assessors Hu Shiheng and Xiong Shichang, and Prosecutor Shi Zhenxiang took their seats in the First Court and summoned the defendants in custody for trial. Ren Jiaxiang, the defense lawyer selected by the defendant Joseph Walton, Chen Shaolie, the appointed defense lawyer, Ge Xiujian, the defense lawyer selected by the defendant Huang Weiyou, Ma Xuchang, the defense lawyer selected by the defendant Chen Wenjie, and the appointed defense lawyers for the defendants Lu Haifang, Wang Moqing, Hu Kelin, and Yu Ruiyuan, were all present in court. From 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, a recess was announced for lunch. The debate continued at 2:00 PM until midnight, when the debate was declared concluded, and sentencing was scheduled. The defendants were returned to custody. Before the trial began, due to concerns about public security, a notice was issued prohibiting onlookers. Therefore, the content of the questioning and debate is unknown. However, it was heard that Joseph Walton claimed not to know his nationality, name, education, or family situation when questioned, but he spoke eloquently and endlessly about matters outside the case. The nickname "Strange Westerner" or "Mysterious Westerner" is indeed well-deserved. As for Jiang Junyu, the woman who had been released on bail by the Shanghai Garrison Command, Lu Haifang identified her as the "bank kid" mentioned in the English bills found on the "Strange Westerner." Therefore, the Hubei High Court Prosecutor also considered her important and sent a letter the day before yesterday to bring her to the case for investigation. However, after the investigation, she was still released on bail and ordered to be available for questioning at any time, or she may be prosecuted in a separate case. (August 22nd)</p>
<h3>Robbery of Passenger Bus by Bandits on the Beijing-Wuhu Road; Driver Shot and Passengers Robbed</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After the completion of the Beijing-Wuhu Highway in 1933, long-distance buses began operating in June of that year. The entire route is 100 kilometers long. Wuhu is both a major town in Anhui Province and on the Yangtze River, and it is also close to the capital, so there are many travelers coming and going. Great importance is also attached to the protection of safety along the way. Major stations have military police stationed. Since the opening of the road, it has been very peaceful, and the military police in Anhui Province have recently been withdrawn due to some events. Unexpectedly, at 5:40 AM this morning, the first passenger bus (No. 61.515) from Yan to Beijing on the Beijing-Wuhu Highway was traveling to a sub-station 20 miles away from Wuhu when two bandits, dressed in Western-style shirts and blue-and-white striped shorts, posing as passengers, boarded the bus. They spoke with a Hunan accent and appeared to be around 20 years old. Less than a mile after the bus left the sub-station, one of the bandits went to the driver Zhang Jinqing's seat, calmly pulled out a pistol, fired two shots, and forced the bus to stop. Seeing this, Zhang accelerated, intending to reach the next station to avoid disaster. Unexpectedly, the bandit fired a shot at Zhang's abdomen, and the bullet penetrated his abdomen and exited from his right thigh. He immediately lost his ability to drive, and the bus stopped on the side of the road. The bandits then searched the passengers, including Wang Bichen, a doctor from Xiaguan, Nanjing, who was robbed of several dozen yuan in cash and a sphygmomanometer worth about seventy or eighty yuan. Shen Yuncheng, a lawyer from Wuhu, lost several tax deed receipts, a lawyer's uniform, and some cash. The total loss for all passengers was about several hundred yuan. At that time, Peng Jiaosong, a worker from the bus company, was on the bus. Seeing the situation, he jumped out of the back of the bus and ran towards the 20-mile sub-station. The bandits opened fire and shot remotely from the window, but luckily missed. After obtaining the stolen goods, the bandits got off the bus and fled eastward. When the Wuhu General Station received the news, they reported to the Second District Security Command and the Wuhu Public Security Bureau. Security teams and patrol teams were dispatched by car to pursue the bandits, but they had already fled without a trace. The company dispatched another bus to take the passengers to Beijing and sent the injured driver Zhang Jinqing to the Yijishan Hospital in Wuhu for treatment. Although he had lost a lot of blood, his life was not in danger. All bus services were restored to normal. Officials attached great importance to the fact that bandits dared to rob a passenger bus on the Beijing-Wuhu National Highway in broad daylight and have dispatched teams along the way to search for the bandits to ensure safety. (August 22nd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Record of the Trial of the Parricide Case</h3>
<p>The case of Zhang Xu, the wife of Mo Jia Ya Nei Ying, being murdered by her son Shunxi in collusion with Shen and Yu on August 5th has been reported in this newspaper. The defendant Zhang Shunxi was immediately escorted to the court prosecutor's office for interrogation after the discovery of his mother's body. He fully confessed to conspiring to murder her. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution for the crime of premeditated murder. Today, he was summoned by the Criminal Court. President Yang Litang, accompanied by Secretary Li, ascended the court and summoned the defendant Zhang Shunxi to the case and appointed Zhang Bingyang as his pro bono lawyer. According to the defendant's testimony, he was previously convicted by his mother and imprisoned. After being released from prison, he, Yu from Zhangze and Shen from Fengxian, were released on the same day. They conspired to murder his mother in the Yishiyuan teahouse. That night, he sent Yu and Shen to pretend to be a midwife named Li from Changqiao Street to invite his mother to the open space behind the nursery, where they strangled her with Yu's belt. Shunxi held the deceased's hands and feet until she died. After her death, he found 26 silver dollars, six jiao in small silver coins, and more than 40 copper coins on the deceased. Yu also stripped the deceased's clothes and took them away. After the confession, the neighbors were summoned for interrogation. The case will be investigated further.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Shipping Boat Robbed Midway in Kunshan and Taicang</h3>
<p>A ship sailing between Kunshan and Taicang Hengjing was fully loaded with goods and seven passengers and departed from Kunshan at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, heading for Hengjing. At about 8:00 PM, it reached the Sanqianwan area of the Eighth District, where it encountered a pirate ship with seven or eight bandits on board, armed with two pistols, who ordered it to stop. Seeing this, the boat owner Yuan Fenglai stopped the boat. The bandits then boarded the ship and robbed all the passengers of their belongings. After the robbery, they ordered the passengers to go ashore and then ordered the boat owner to sail the boat towards Yangcheng Lake. When they were near the lake, the bandits tied up the boatman and threw him on the shore. Then they rocked the boat into Yangcheng Lake. At 8:00 AM yesterday, passersby found the boatmen and untied them. The boat owner immediately went to the Lujiaqiao Public Security Patrol Station to report the incident and requested that the bandits be arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Suzhou, Fire Outside Chang Gate Claims Seven Lives</h3>
<p>Zhu Shunxing Broom Shop, No. 242 South Hao Street outside Chang Gate, was opened by Zhu Renshan. Two years ago, a fire occurred, killing two people. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out again yesterday morning. Due to the dry weather, flames quickly engulfed the roof. After receiving reports, various fire brigades rushed to the scene and worked hard to extinguish the fire. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to neighboring houses. However, the fire broke out in the late night, and the shop owner and his wife were fast asleep upstairs. They were awakened from their dreams and tried to escape. Zhu's wife, Cheng, and her younger sister, Cheng Xiaoxiang, jumped out of the building and escaped. The shop owner, Zhu Renshan, and his child, Zhu Qingyuan, were unable to escape and perished in the fire. Three neighbors who were renting in the shop and two broom customers were also burned to death. A total of seven men and women were killed, which is truly tragic. After the fire was extinguished, people dug out six charred corpses from the rubble, their flesh unrecognizable. One child's body was still missing and had not been found. It is feared that it had been burned to ashes. At noon, the local prosecutor's office sent personnel to examine the corpses one by one and ordered coffins to be prepared for burial.</p>
<h3>Wuxi, Ministry Approval for Decimal Subsidiary Currency</h3>
<p>Xu Ruzhou, the standing committee member of the local wine and sauce shop industry association, and Shi Weilin, the standing committee member of the tobacco industry association, previously requested the Ministry of Finance to implement decimal subsidiary currency as soon as possible to help businesses that suffered significant losses due to the sharp drop in foreign prices in the county. Yesterday, they received instruction No. 677 from the Ministry of Finance, stating, "Received your submission. The Ministry is currently studying and planning the reorganization of subsidiary currency. In the future, upon finalization and implementation, the currency in circulation in the market may be changed to cash, fen, and li. There will be a separate plan for reorganizing copper coins. Please be informed of this approval."</p>
<h3>Chief Judge and Prosecutor Swearing-in Ceremony</h3>
<p>Since the county court was changed to the district court on July 1, the chief judge, Cui Yun恭, and the prosecutor, Qian Chengjun, had not yet been sworn in. Yesterday (the 23rd) at 10:00 AM, a supplementary swearing-in ceremony was held in the court. Shen Yuan, the presiding judge of the Civil Division 1 of the High Court, was appointed by the High Court to preside over the ceremony. County Magistrate Wang Baoquan, County Party Committee member Li Tiping, County Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Yuchu, guest Jiang Mengxiang, and others gave speeches before the ceremony concluded.</p>
<h3>Changzhou, Continued Apprehension of Major Criminals in the Liu Hangsu Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Liu Hangsu, the second son of the late painter Liu Ran of Dongxiatang, Wuyi County, was kidnapped in the second district Xizhou last November while collecting rent. To this day, there has been no news. It was rumored that Liu had been killed or had died of illness in the bandit's lair. Two major criminals, Xu Qinghuang and others, were interrogated by the county government and confirmed to be guilty and were executed by shooting. Liu Hangsu's servants, Zhu Guixian and Fan Guofu, and six others, were also major criminals in the case. They had impersonated Liu Hangsu to negotiate ransom payments. After Xu and others were executed, Zhu and the others disappeared. Now, the two criminals, Zhu and Pan, have been captured by the Taixing County Public Security Bureau, and personnel have been dispatched to Changzhou to arrange their extradition. Magistrate Hou immediately ordered investigator Chen Sendu to select detectives to go to Taixing on the 22nd. Today (the 23rd), they should be able to bring them back to Changzhou for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang, Land Bureau Appoints Inspectors</h3>
<p>The Provincial Land Bureau has appointed officials to inspect land registration in the fourteen counties of Shanghai, Fengxian, Songjiang, Qingpu, Nanhui, Jiading, Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujiang, Nantong, Changshu, Wujin, Danyang, and Zhenjiang, all of which have started land registration with a one-year completion plan. Since implementation, Wuxi, Fengxian, and Shanghai have been progressing smoothly, with as many as 2,000 or more applications for registration per day, a situation unprecedented before. Now, to complete the project ahead of schedule, the Bureau has specially appointed multiple staff members to go to various counties to supervise registration. Ding Songlin for Wujin, Li Qizhen for Danyang, Yu Renmei for Nanhui, Qian Leyao for Qingpu, Zhang Yizhi for Songjiang, Wu Zunyi for Wuxian, and Yao Qiyu for Changshu have been assigned. After Director Zhu instructed the staff members, they went to their respective counties to carry out supervisory work.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou, Sudden Increase in Demand for Zhejiang Autumn Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Province is actively promoting autumn silkworm breeding through the Construction Department, and the industry has been expanding year by year. This autumn, the silk market has gradually improved, and demand has increased sharply. It is estimated to be about 700,000 sheets, breaking all previous records. However, the total autumn egg production of all breeding farms in Zhejiang Province is only 180,000 sheets. The Silk Control Association has successively purchased 240,000 sheets from breeding farms in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Hushu Pass in Jiangsu Province. It has also pre-ordered 40,000 sheets of late autumn eggs from Zhenjiang, totaling 460,000 sheets. The supply still falls far short of demand, making it extremely difficult to allocate to various counties and cities. Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoji believes that the shortage of silkworm eggs will greatly affect the livelihood of farmers and has telegraphed Jiangsu Chairman Chen to find a way to transfer some eggs to supplement the supply. The improved seeds for various counties and cities have already begun to be distributed for breeding.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Datong Lane Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Chen Cai, a resident of No. 48 Datong Lane in Hangzhou City, runs a candle shop in the lane. This morning (the 23rd) at 4:45 AM, a fire was accidentally started by mosquito incense. Thick smoke filled the air, and the fire quickly spread. Fire brigades rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out after an hour. A total of four buildings were burned down, with losses estimated at 5,000 gold.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen's Interview with the Press Yesterday: Discussing the National Economic Council's Efforts in Construction; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Attention to Developing the Northwest and Southwest; Hoping Shanghai Banks Will Invest and Lend More</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, flew west from Shanghai on the 16th of this month to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the National Economic Council's construction of the Northwest and Southwest. Along the way, he also inspected flood conditions in various places. He returned to Nanjing on the 20th after completing his official duties, and returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 22nd. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, he met with reporters from various newspapers at the Bank of China and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Discussing Construction of the Northwest and Southwest</p>
<p>Mr. Song went to the Bank of China at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to handle official business. He first met with prominent bankers such as Bei Songsun and Ye Zhuotang. After Bei and Ye left, he met with the press. He said that he and Finance Minister Kong had gone to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss matters concerning the Economic Council's future construction of the Northwest and Southwest. Since Chairman Chiang is also one of the five Standing Committee Members of the Economic Council, Chiang's opinion is that the knowledge of the people and the local construction in the Northwest and Southwest provinces are far inferior to those in the Southeast provinces and must be developed immediately. Chiang also advised Shanghai bankers to invest and lend more in these areas, so that rural finance would be ample and local economies could develop.</p>
<p>Most of the Remnant Communists in Sichuan Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>As for the suppression of bandits in Sichuan Province, since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Sichuan, he has supervised the officers and soldiers to encircle and suppress them in separate directions. Over the past few months, most of the remnant bandits have been eliminated. This time, because he had been away from Nanjing for a long time, he left Sichuan and traveled east to inspect everything.</p>
<p>Striving to Develop the Northwest</p>
<p>Mr. Song continued to discuss the National Economic Council, saying that the most important task of the Economic Council in the future is the construction of highways in various provinces and cities. Many highways have already been built. The three main roads of Sichuan-Hubei, Sichuan-Gansu, and Sichuan-Shaanxi are very important to the construction of the Northwest. Since construction began, most of them have been completed, and construction is still ongoing. These three roads are very long and have continuous mountain peaks, so construction is more difficult. Mr. Song also said that to develop the Northwest provinces, it is most important to strive for progress in transportation. It has been decided to first focus on the construction of railways and highways and the dredging of water conservancy in these provinces.</p>
<p>No Decision Yet on Currency Reform</p>
<p>Regarding the dispatch of personnel from the five countries of Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan to China to investigate China's currency problem, the representatives of Britain and Italy have already set off for China. Mr. Song did not express any important opinions on this, only saying that the banking community has not yet received detailed news. As for the foreign news that the countries sent personnel to China to investigate for various purposes, such as Britain hoping that China's currency would be related to the British pound, France hoping to be related to gold, and the United States hoping to be related to the US dollar, he said that he did not dare to fully believe it and that he had not heard that the dispatch of personnel to China contained such purposes. The Ministry of Finance is conducting a reorganization of the national currency system. As far as he knows, it does not seem to have made a decision yet. The reorganization of the national currency system is indeed important and cannot be delayed, but this matter is of great importance and should be discussed at length before proceeding.</p>
<p>Relief Funds for Disaster Victims Under the Auspices of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Mr. Song finally said that he had gone west to inspect the flood conditions in various provinces. The disaster situation was serious and urgently needed funds for relief. However, relief for disaster victims has always been under the auspices of the Minister of Finance, and he did not know the details.</p>
<h3>President Sun Arrives in Shanghai: President Wang Decides to Resume His Post; The Resumption of Posts by Various Ministers is Even Less of a Problem; The Publication Law Still Awaits Review by the Central Political Council</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, returned to Nanjing from Qingdao a few days ago and arrived in Shanghai by night train the night before last at 11:00 PM.

After resting briefly, he went out to visit friends and did not return to his residence until about 10:30 AM to rest. He successively received Yang Dezhao, Huang Hanliang, and reporters from various newspapers. According to Mr. Sun, President Wang has now dispelled his intention to resign and decided to resume his post. The resumption of posts by various ministers is even less of a problem. At present, domestic affairs and foreign affairs are as before, without any changes. The focus of the Sixth Plenary Session will be on preparations for the Fifth National Congress, which is scheduled to be held on November 12 and will not be delayed. The draft constitution is currently stored in the Central Standing Committee and will be submitted to the Fifth National Congress for approval after discussion at the Sixth Plenary Session. He had not heard of Hu Zhantang and Wang Chonghui returning to China.

<h3>Raising Funds for Flood Relief: Standing Committee Meeting Tomorrow; Inviting Zhang Zhijiang to Serve as Head of Overseas Fundraising Group; Discussing Allocation of Expired Aviation Lottery Prizes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces has been working intensely and achieving good results in raising flood relief funds in recent days. In addition to the Women's Fundraising Group, which has been invited to be headed by Madam Kong Soong Ai-ling, the association has now invited Zhang Zhijiang to serve as the head of the Overseas Fundraising Group to conduct fundraising activities overseas. It has also sent a letter to the Aviation Lottery Office, requesting the allocation of expired lottery prizes. In addition, the association has scheduled a Standing Committee meeting for tomorrow (the 25th). The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Conducting Overseas Fundraising</p>
<p>The Relief Association sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Central Committee member Zhang Zhijiang, inviting Mr. Zhang to serve as the director of the Overseas Fundraising Group and conduct fundraising activities overseas. Zhu Ziqiao was also invited to join the Overseas Fundraising Group, but he is unable to leave the country due to official business. In addition to sending a letter to Mr. Zhang in the United States, asking him to work hard to raise relief funds, the association also sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that it inform the consuls of Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and other countries to assist Mr. Zhang in raising funds for flood relief overseas.</p>
<p>Discussing Allocation of Unclaimed Aviation Lottery Prizes</p>
<p>In addition, the Relief Association believes that fundraising by the design and fundraising groups is very busy. To maximize resources, the association sent a letter to the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office, asking it to participate in disaster relief, still based on the previous method of the office, to collect the unclaimed prizes after the aviation lottery is drawn each month and transfer them to the Relief Association to assist in disaster relief.</p>
<p>Li Dachao Discusses Securing Relief Loans</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Li Dachao, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Group of the Relief Association yesterday. According to him, the 500,000 yuan that the Relief Association had previously borrowed from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks in the city has been fully secured and is in the process of filling out the contracts separately. The Standing Committee meeting tomorrow will discuss the allocation of the borrowed 500,000 yuan relief funds and fundraising matters. Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, so it cannot be delayed for a day.</p>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces has issued a notice to convene a meeting of all Standing Committee members, scheduled for tomorrow (the 25th) at 4:00 PM at the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road. The most important agenda items of this meeting are: (1) how to allocate the borrowed 500,000 yuan to various provinces; (2) how to conduct fundraising separately, in addition to the borrowed 500,000 yuan; (3) the manual procedures for internal office work should be reorganized to be simple and fast.</p>
<p>Sending Disaster Victims Back to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>At about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Renji Hall on Yunnan Road issued boat tickets to more than 200 disaster victims from Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces in the Yangtze River region who had come to Shanghai to beg for food due to the recent floods, and sent them back to their hometowns in their respective provinces. After all, it is not a long-term solution for these disaster victims to wander in Shanghai. After the disaster, returning to their hometowns, they can gradually plan to cultivate and make a living. It is said that 200 of these disaster victims were taken away by the Xinjiangtian wheel yesterday.</p>
<p>Martial Arts Groups Perform for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Martial Arts Hall and the Jingwu Athletic Association believe that the floods in various places this year are extremely severe and the situation is tragic. It is their unavoidable duty to raise funds for relief. Various groups in Shanghai have held art performances for disaster relief one after another. The martial arts comrades in this city should also express something. Therefore, the two groups jointly initiated the Shanghai Martial Arts Community Disaster Relief Performance. Yesterday, a preparatory meeting was held at the Jingwu Special Zone Branch of the Continental Department Store. It was decided that all preparatory expenses would be borne by the two initiating groups, and all ticket proceeds would be used for relief funds. It is said that the second preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held at 8:00 PM on the 26th of this month, and all martial arts circles in the city have been notified to welcome their participation.</p>
<p>The Museum Received Donations Yesterday</p>

<h3>Minister Kong et al. Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Chu Minyi left Nanjing by night express train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Loan Association Strictly Prohibits Illegal Solicitation: Anyone Engaging in Such Conduct Will Be Prosecuted According to Law</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Industrial and Commercial Credit Small Loan and the review and lending of various situations by the Loan Review Committee have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that after accepting applications for these loans, the association dispatches personnel to conduct on-site investigations. However, it has recently been discovered that some unscrupulous people among the merchants applying for loans are making improper solicitations during the investigation, hoping to deceive. The person in charge of the association specifically met with visiting reporters yesterday and said that this action by the applicants is illegal and shows a lack of understanding of the Loan Committee's review of loan applications. It must be known that every application to the association must go through several public review procedures and be submitted to the general meeting for review before a decision can be made. If the applicant's situation is untrue, it will be difficult to obtain a loan through deception. Moreover, the above-mentioned behavior is a violation of criminal law. If the committee discovers such behavior again in the future, it will be prosecuted according to law. The committee is now doing its best to provide convenience within its possible scope to those who apply properly, so as to provide relief, but will never tolerate this type of troublemaker.</p>
<h3>International Telegraph Bureau Prepares for Sino-Japanese Telephone Communication: Yesterday Discussed the Engineering for Connecting Chinese Lines in the Chinese Area</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The various components of the international wireless telephone being prepared by the International Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications have all been ordered from the British STANDARD Electric Manufacturing Factory. After being transported to Shanghai, they were moved to the Zhenru Radio Station for complete assembly. The International Telegraph Bureau then notified the China Electric Company, the Shanghai-based manager of the factory, to send British engineers to test communication with Tokyo, Kobe, Osaka, and other places in Japan for several days. The time difference is only one hour. Sometimes, there are still obstacles and insulation problems in terms of audio transmission, so research and testing are still continuing. The International Telegraph Bureau has been instructed by the Ministry of Communications to realize Sino-Japanese communication in the near future, so the bureau is actively preparing. Yesterday afternoon, the International Telegraph Bureau and the International Wireless Radio Station invited the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to discuss the engineering for connecting antennas. It was decided to first connect the trunk lines of various users in the Chinese area to the Zhenru International Wireless Telephone Station. A letter will also be sent to the Shanghai Telephone Company in the near future to negotiate the release of user antennas in the concession area. As for the foreign news that the Director of the Telephone Administration Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Communications, Arakawa, has been specially sent to Shanghai to contact China for communication procedures, the International Telegraph Bureau said that it has not received this report.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Explains Ambiguities in the Stamp Tax Law</h3>
<p>Explanation of Duplicate Copies: The City Chamber of Commerce replied to the Dazhong Dye Factory, explaining the so-called duplicate copies in the implementation rules of the stamp tax law. Article 3 of the implementation rules of the stamp tax law defines duplicate copies as those whose content is completely the same as the original that has been affixed with stamp tax. The so-called completely the same content refers to the matters recorded and the format recorded being completely the same. In other words, it is the so-called "one style in two copies" in common parlance. The so-called completely the same in nature in the letter is very different from the meaning of content and nature. If it is only the same in nature, but the content differs in complexity and detail, according to the interpretation of Article 3 of the implementation rules, it is not recognized as a duplicate copy and is not exempt from affixing stamps.</p>
<p>Nature of Delivery Receipts: The delivery receipt, signed by the customer and taken back to the company, is a receipt for the goods. According to the temporary regulations on stamp tax, it may not need to be stamped, but since the implementation of the stamp tax law on September 1, it is treated the same as silver and money receipts and must be stamped. This is an absolute difference between the old and new laws, and must be recognized. The letter mistakenly assumes that the return slip is a substitute for the invoice because it has no price and is marked as having a separate invoice. I do not know that this note should be stamped, purely as a receipt for the goods, for future proof, and is another matter from the invoice. Since this return slip is signed by the customer and taken back to the company for verification, it originally belongs to the receipt issued by the customer to the company, and the customer should be responsible for affixing the stamps.</p>
<p>Responsibility for Stamping Bills of Exchange: The Chamber of Commerce also explained the responsibility for stamping bills of exchange in a letter to the Shanghai Local Court, stating that the responsibility for stamping bills of exchange rests with the drawer, as always. That is, judging from the invoice, if an invoice without stamp tax is found in the hands of the customer, only the shop that issued the invoice will be fined, and the customer who received the invoice will never be fined. The responsibility for stamping bills of exchange lies with the drawer, and there is no difference from the invoice. Then, the method of punishment should also be the same, and it is not appropriate to make the recipient suffer for others. According to the previous letter, this letter should be sent to your court for your reference.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Arrives in Shanghai by Train This Afternoon: The Disaster Report Is Being Drafted</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, left Shanghai in early September to inspect the floods in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other provinces in the Yellow River basin. Now that he has completed his official duties, he has returned to Nanjing. On the previous two days, Mr. Xu visited Wang Jingwei and Kong Xiangxi in Nanjing to report on the inspection and discuss relief measures. Mr. Xu believes that the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces is scheduled to hold a Standing Committee meeting tomorrow (the 25th) and must rush back to attend. Therefore, he initially planned to return to Shanghai by the China Merchants Jiang'an Wheel yesterday, but the plan was temporarily suspended due to official business. He remained in Nanjing to discuss the dredging of the Jianghan River with Hubei Chairman Zhang Yuejun and others. Now, according to news from the Xu residence in this city, Mr. Xu has changed his plans and will take the Nanjing 8:00 AM express train to Shanghai. It is also learned that Xu's report on the inspection of the floods in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other provinces is still being drafted and can be submitted to the central government and released two or three days after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Finance Ministry's Tax Affairs Department Trains Stamp Duty Inspectors and Commissioners; Lectures on the Evolution of Tax Laws and Various Procedures; Commissioners to Depart for Various Provinces and Cities for Inspection</h3>
<p>The new Stamp Duty Law is scheduled to take effect on September 1st.

<h3>Li Zuicong Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Mr. Li Jingcong, the General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, traveled from Shanghai to Beiping in mid-month to visit relatives and inspect the situation at the Beiping branch. He then traveled south to Nanjing at the end of last week to report to Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua. Upon learning that landing at the Hanzhong airport was difficult during the Shaanxi-Chengdu route test flight, he went to Xi'an again to personally negotiate with Shaanxi Chairman Shao Lizi. After completing a second inspection of Beiping and Tianjin, Mr. Li took the Shanghai-Beiping through train south, passing through Nanjing and arriving in Shanghai. He arrived at the North Station at 7:40 AM yesterday. He then went to the headquarters on Renji Road to handle various matters before returning to his residence to rest.</p>

<h3>A Section of the Shentan Shoal Has Been Dredged; Change in Dredging Area; Original Dredging Site Moved Several Thousand Feet South; Customs Buoy Moved Accordingly</h3>
<p>The Shentan shoal outside the Wusongkou is located at the center of the Yangtze River estuary. The depth of the shoal is only between fifteen and seventeen feet, which obstructs the passage of oceangoing ships with deeper drafts during low tide. The Dredging Bureau, recognizing this problem, planned to dredge the shoal and ordered a giant mud dredger, the "Jianshe" (Construction) from the Schichau shipyard in Germany. It arrived in Shanghai in April of this year and sailed to the shoal for trial dredging. These events have been reported in the newspapers. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has compiled the following detailed updates:</p>
<p>Dredging Progress</p>
<p>The giant mud dredger "Jianshe" of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau sailed to the Shentan shoal for trial dredging after arriving in Shanghai. The results were excellent. It officially started dredging at the beginning of last month. The trial dredging signal was removed, and the international signal flag (.A.H.F flag, indicating that the ship is engaged in dredging work) was used instead. The working hours are limited to daytime only. The above is the progress from the trial dredging period to the official dredging period.</p>
<p>Change of Area</p>
<p>The Shentan shoal is located northeast of Wusongkou, about thirty nautical miles away. The dredging area is twenty nautical miles long and about one thousand feet wide. The dredging line is oriented east-west. A Datong News Agency reporter learned from the Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau, Xue Zhuobin, yesterday morning that the current dredging site is a section of the Lanjiang sandbar. The preliminary work on this section has been completed. Therefore, starting yesterday, the orientation of the dredging area has been changed, remaining east-west but shifted slightly south by several thousand feet.</p>
<p>Daytime Work</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Xue added that all the crew members work on the ship, even on Sundays. However, the ship returns to Shanghai every two weeks to replenish coal, water, and food. The working hours are still limited to daytime. The preliminary dredging plan is scheduled for five years. Rumors that it will be completed in two years are due to people not being familiar with the Bureau's situation, he said.</p>
<p>Customs Notice</p>
<p>Since the dredging area has changed, the buoys placed by the Customs must also be changed accordingly. Here is the notice from the Maritime Affairs Section: It is hereby announced that the import buoys in the Yangtze River channel under the Jianghai Customs have been added and moved for the convenience of dredging. Now that the dredging area of the Lanjiang sandbar at the Yangtze River entrance is about to change, all the buoys there should be moved or added to facilitate the operation. A. Buoys to be moved (details omitted). B. Buoys to be added (details omitted). C. Effective date: around August 22nd of this year.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Citizens Urge the Government to Cancel the Original Land Acquisition Plan; Listing Difficulties and Unnecessary Circumstances</h3>
<p>Apply to Change the Location and Set Other Methods; Songjiang County Citizens Sun X, Sheng, etc., submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, etc., regarding the Shanghai Radio Station's requisition of private land. The presentation stated that the Shanghai Radio Station disregarded people's livelihood and forcefully requisitioned farmland. It requested that the location be changed and other methods be set. Now that the time is pressing, the presentation continued, please quickly stop the project from proceeding. The presenters previously submitted a report because the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau was boastful and ambitious, making empty plans and forcefully requisitioning private farmland, which harmed the livelihoods of thousands of people. They requested that the location be changed and other methods be set, but the Telegraph Bureau repeatedly deceived the Executive Yuan and demanded that the Songjiang County Government issue a public notice, acting willfully and forcefully seizing private property for its own selfish purposes and to carry out unnecessary projects. This has caused widespread anxiety among the people, as if a catastrophe is about to occur. This three hundred mu of land is the source of livelihood for more than two hundred farming households and more than a thousand people. They have lived and fed off it for thousands of years. Their homes and graves are all within it. If it is seized, they will inevitably be displaced, their wives and children separated, and their lives will not be protected. This is tantamount to sentencing thousands of people to death at the same time. To overturn graves and expose bones would be a disaster for their ancestors. Is it right for those in power who care about the people's livelihood to act in this disastrous way? Moreover, their plan is still hypothetical, and the services are not urgent. It only wastes public funds and does not benefit the country, but harms the people's livelihood and causes thousands of people to be displaced. The harm is already apparent. We hereby present the following to your ministries and the Executive Yuan: (1) The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau originally had twenty sets of machines. Now it plans to expand to twenty-nine sets. That is, only nine sets are being expanded, and it is still under planning. However, they claimed to the mediator that they had already ordered them from a foreign country, which is obviously false. (2) The original Telegraph Bureau's transmitting stations are located on Xin Zha, Maigen, and Zhonghua Roads. The total land occupied by these three sites is less than twenty mu, which can already accommodate twenty transmitting machines. Based on this ratio, combining the address of a foreign address, the official address can be further reduced. If not, expanding to thirty or forty mu would be enough to accommodate everything. Now they are requisitioning up to three hundred mu of land, which is obviously false. (3) Moving east and west, dismantling and installing, all require sighs. Moreover, even if at most thirty or forty mu of land are needed, they are requisitioning more than three hundred mu of land, increasing the cost tenfold. It is an extreme waste of public funds. Even if the national treasury were full, it would still be unacceptable, especially when the farmers are looking up at the roof and the national treasury is empty, relying on borrowing to get by. Borrowing without real benefit to the people is still unacceptable, let alone forcefully taking the people's farmland, seizing the livelihood of thousands of people, and increasing the burden on the people of the whole country. It is harmful to the country and disastrous to the people. Is this what Premier Sun's Doctrine of the People's Livelihood allows? Is this what our government's Instruction No. 293 allows? (4) The Zhenru International Wireless Radio Transmitting Station has relations with the whole world and is on a large scale, which is incomparable to the local radio station in Shanghai. However, its land occupation is only two hundred and thirty-eight mu. Such a large radio station occupies less than three hundred mu, which shows the Shanghai Radio Station's false reporting and need for more land. (5) The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's plan is to build control stations with wireless radio stations in Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Hankou, and Yantai. All the above places have wired telegraphs that can be connected. When all industries are declining and wired telegraphs have few people to consult, they want to add wireless radio stations, which is like piling beds on top of each other and drawing legs on a snake, just for show and not practical, and it greatly harms the people's livelihood. Can this be stopped? For the above reasons, the Shanghai Radio Station's forceful requisition of a large amount of private land is false, has private intentions, wastes public funds, is not practical, seizes people's property, and harms the people's livelihood. For the sake of the country and the local people, it is necessary to cancel the established case, change the location, and set other methods. The Songjiang County Government, in view of the people's situation, issued a public letter to cancel the public notice (a copy is submitted separately). The Jiangsu Provincial Government is also aware of the people's anger and has a directive to consult with the internal and transportation ministries. The lives of thousands of people are at stake, and we dare to appeal to you again. We hope that you will order the cancellation of the original land acquisition plan, change the location, and set other methods to relieve the people's suffering and give importance to people's livelihood. We anxiously await your orders. Respectfully submitted to the President of the Executive Yuan Wang, Minister of the Interior Huang, Minister of Transportation Zhu, and Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Chen.</p>

<h3>Cotton Control Commission Bans Watering and Adulteration; Japanese Textile Industry Suggests Submission for Discussion</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China offered the following plan to the Cotton Control Commission of our country for improving Chinese cotton: (1) The amount of water mixed in the cotton will be limited to a minimum of 9% in the future. However, starting this year, both the minimum and maximum limits will be temporarily increased by 1%, that is, the minimum will be 10% and the maximum will be 12%. (2) Make every effort to prevent the mixing of foreign substances (such as sand and gravel). Implement strict inspections locally. At the same time, check the cotton export areas. If there are improper behaviors such as red flying, heavy penalties will be imposed. (3) If Chinese cotton is exported abroad in the future, the packaging methods must be improved, the weighing should be unified, and the quality should be strictly selected. (4) Regarding the weighing matters in transportation, this requirement is not only hoped for by Japanese textile companies, but also by Chinese textile companies. There is no need to elaborate. Because Chinese textile companies account for two-thirds of the consumption of Chinese cotton, it is not surprising that they have the same requirements.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Cotton Control Commission yesterday morning that the commission is implementing the first article of the Provisional Regulations for banning watering and adulteration of cotton: "The statutory standard for domestic cotton is 11% moisture content." Article 2: "The maximum moisture content for the sale of domestic cotton in the market is 13%." Article 7: "If the moisture content of the cotton purchased by the yarn mill exceeds the standard moisture content but does not exceed the maximum limit, the price should be deducted according to the moisture content. If the moisture content does not meet the standard, the price should be compensated accordingly." The commission has made further efforts to reduce the maximum limit to 12% and will gradually reduce it. As for the opinions contributed by the Japanese yarn mill association, they will be submitted to the committee for discussion upon receipt. In general, there is no practical problem.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Rally; Submit to Party and Government to Send Personnel to Participate and Send Letters to All Sectors for Speeches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Rent Reduction Committee will hold a Rejuvenating Market Rent Reduction Rally at the Ningbo Fellow Association at 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month. The committee submitted a request to the party and government yesterday to send personnel to participate and guide, and sent letters to celebrities from all sectors to attend and give speeches. Excerpts from the committee's submissions and letters to all sectors are as follows:</p>
<p>Submissions to the Party and Government</p>
<p>In accordance with the decision of the Rent Reduction Committee, the Rejuvenating Market Rent Reduction Rally will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road at 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month. It is requested that your ministries and governments send personnel to guide and assist in the grand event. Although some residents have benefited from the rent reduction movement over the years through the voluntary rent reduction of understanding landlords, it is still minimal. At a time when the commercial market is declining day by day, although prices are low, purchasing power is very weak, resulting in daily store closures, the lack of financial adjustment is a major reason. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major elements of life, and the burden of housing rent accounts for about five-tenths. Therefore, to increase purchasing power, it is necessary to reduce the burden of housing to maintain the difficult situation. The association should respond to the expectations of all citizens for rent reduction, and for the sake of public opinion and for the sake of rejuvenating the market, it has to seek the realization of unified rent reduction. We have repeatedly submitted requests to your ministries and governments to promulgate rent reduction measures. Now, in order to promote rent reduction, we have specifically scheduled the rent reduction rally at 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month, and from that day to the end of the month, we will post slogans and distribute leaflets to publicize the request to landlords. We have always admired your ministries and governments for caring about the people's hardships, and we hope that you will immediately order the implementation of rent reduction and send personnel to guide, so as to emphasize the importance of the people's movement. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Special City Party Department and Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Letters to All Sectors</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, China has been hit by disasters, with successive droughts and floods, rural bankruptcy, and urban collapse. This city is located on the banks of the Huangpu River, with smooth transportation. Since the opening of the commercial port, the city has been thriving day by day. However, citizens are ignorant of immediate interests and do not think about long-term plans. Speculators tend to regard the operation of real estate as a shortcut to wealth. Therefore, rents have increased, forming a畸展怪状, sucking bone marrow, no different from cutting down trees to seek growth. In recent years, the market has declined sharply, and industry and commerce have plummeted. The prosperous city has turned desolate, and citizens are working hard but cannot afford to eat and stay warm. However, the price index has gradually returned to the normal track of life, and the burden of rent is still above food and clothing. The association cannot bear for the citizens to be trapped in high rents for a long time. In order to maintain the great plan of people's livelihood, we are promoting rent reduction to achieve an appropriate solution. In order to awaken landlords to reduce rents, we have specifically scheduled a rent reduction rally at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road at 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month, so that rent reduction can be implemented as soon as possible. We have always known that your reputation is well-deserved and admired by the whole world, so we specially send this letter, requesting that you take the time to attend and express your great ideas for us to follow, which will be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yansong, Yu Zuoting, and other gentlemen, Shanghai First Special District Rent Reduction Committee, August 23rd.</p>

<h3>Construction of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Bridge: Ningbo Compatriot Association Convened a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Progress and Submitted a Report to Chairman Chiang for Approval</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai convened a special committee meeting yesterday to discuss the construction of the Ningbo Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Bridge. Attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Jin Runxiang, Fang Jiaobo, Zhu Meixian, Zhang Shensan, Mao Heyuan, Zhang Jiguang, Mu Zixiang, He Shaoting, and Wu Yaqin. Yu Qiaqing served as chairman, and Zhao Kuiyi recorded the minutes. (A) Matters Reported: (Omitted). (B) Matters Resolved: (1) Approved the public announcement soliciting initiators (recorded below). (2) To submit a report on the progress to Chairman Chiang for review. The public announcement roughly stated: "Chairman Chiang has been dedicated to the Party and the country for thirty years. Provinces and cities, cherishing his benevolence and expressing their admiration, have erected bronze statues and memorial halls to commemorate his achievements, which is a grand undertaking. Ningbo, as the Chairman's ancestral home and a place he frequently visits, should not lag behind in honoring his great accomplishments. Our association members believe that we should inscribe his virtues and accomplishments with works that benefit the people's livelihood, so that they will never be forgotten and will last forever. Therefore, we propose the construction of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Bridge. Ningbo has two bridges spanning the river: one is the Old Jiang Bridge, also known as the Ling Bridge, which crosses the Fenghua River; the other is the New Jiang Bridge, which crosses the Yuyao River. They converge at the Yong River, formerly known as Sanjiangkou (Three Rivers Estuary). The New Jiang Bridge is located northwest of Sanjiangkou, a vital transportation hub where boats and vehicles converge, goods are abundant, shoulders rub against each other, and the number of passersby reaches thousands daily. It is also a place of great concern for both Chinese and foreigners. Using this bridge as a permanent memorial to Chairman Chiang is deemed appropriate by all. Therefore, we have set the plan, examined the engineering, and imitated the new design to make it sturdy and durable, renaming it the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Bridge to signify that we will not forget him. At both ends of the bridge, we will build memorial pavilions, one displaying a portrait of Chairman Chiang, compiling his major events, and recounting his achievements over the years; the other will list the names of the contributors, detailing them in stone. All aspects of the engineering design, the standard of the rules, the amount of donations, and the total funds raised will be reported to Chairman Chiang for record. However, at the beginning of this endeavor, fundraising comes first. We plan to solicit like-minded comrades, regardless of whether they are from Ningbo or not. Those who support the cause can contribute, for example, one hundred gold coins per person, so ten people would contribute one thousand gold coins, one hundred people would contribute ten thousand gold coins, and one thousand people would contribute one hundred thousand gold coins. Considering each individual, it is merely a small offering of water and a little effort. In the future, when the bridge is completed, those who pass by this bridge will consider its name and think of Chairman Chiang's merits, which will always be before their eyes and in their hearts, and will be spread by word of mouth. Then, what was once a small offering of water will be like drinking water and remembering the source, and a little effort will be like basking in the sun and holding a quilt. It will not only bring glory to Siming (Ningbo). The poem 'Lingtai' says, 'We began to build the Lingtai, planning and constructing it. The common people worked on it and completed it in a few days.' We know that the fundraising for this bridge will also have people rushing to contribute for fear of being left behind. Now that the discussion is complete, we describe the origin of the matter as follows. This is the announcement."</p>
<h3>National Goods Promotion Association: Exhibition Scheduled in Suzhou; Letters Sent to Factories for Preparation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association, organizer of the Suzhou National Goods Movement Exhibition, sent letters to participating manufacturers and staff, stating: "To promote national goods and deepen their penetration into the people's lives, with the aim of increasing the strength of consuming national goods, we are holding the Suzhou National Goods Movement Exhibition. The opening is scheduled for September 1st. Participating manufacturers have responded enthusiastically. Space is limited, and those who register first will be given priority. We have verified that your factory has already registered, so we are sending this special letter to inform you that on the morning of the 30th, at 9:00 AM, staff from each factory should bring flags and gather at the North Station to board the train to Suzhou. Upon arrival in Suzhou, we have received a letter from the Suzhou Preparatory Office stating that they will welcome you at the station at the appointed time. In addition to preparing a military band, banners will be hung at the station and other busy locations to express welcome. The goods from each factory must be shipped to Suzhou before the 28th to avoid being rushed. We are sending this letter to request your factory to take note and handle it accordingly. Sincerely, Qian Chengxu, Chairman of the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association, August 23rd."</p>

<h3>Flood Relief Variety Show: Soliciting National Goods; Letters Sent to National Goods Factories Yesterday; Giving to Winning Sisters in the Flower Selection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Variety Show Association is initiating a flower selection to promote the sales of tickets. Yesterday, they sent letters to various national goods factories to solicit national goods products, so that after the election results, they can be given to the winners as encouragement. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Since the beginning of this summer, the Yellow River and Huai River have been flooded, and the Yangtze River and Han River have overflowed.

Therefore, this association was formed to combine charity with variety shows, hoping to gather small contributions to make a large one. All ticket revenue will be used for relief. To promote ticket sales, we have initiated a flower selection to attract the attention of sisters in the flower world, with the aim of increasing ticket sales. Once the titles are selected, in addition to issuing awards separately by our association to encourage and reward them, we also plan to give national goods products to increase their interest in the competition. We have always known that your factory is enthusiastic about public welfare and cares about those in need. As for the quality of your products, they have long been praised by all. We dare to send this letter to ask you to donate some products, and we hope you will indicate the product name, trademark, function, and price, so that they can be displayed in the association for the public to view and for publicity. Once the election is completed, they will be given to the elected famous flowers. If you agree, please reply, and our association will send someone with a receipt to collect them."</p>

<h3>Resolution of the Taxi Industry Association: Penalties for Violating Industry Rules; Yellow Automobile Company Fined for Relief; Officially Responded to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Taxi Industry Association of this city believed that the Yellow Automobile Company's price cutting competition violated industry regulations. It previously submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting a ban. The Social Affairs Bureau approved the association to handle the matter itself. The association convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon of the previous day and resolved to fine the Yellow Automobile Company 1,050 yuan to be transferred to the Flood Relief Association for disaster relief. It also responded to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The association's official response to the Social Affairs Bureau stated: "Regarding the matter of responding to the instructions, we received your bureau's instruction No. 7634, which stated that the Chinese Yellow Automobile Company violated industry regulations and publicly advertised price cuts. We request a prompt ban. In addition to ordering a ban, we requested the association to propose measures to punish and sanction in accordance with industry regulations, and then submit them for approval. Upon receiving this, our association immediately convened an emergency meeting of temporary members, attended by Sun Bingsheng of the Yuegong Automobile Company and 23 other companies. It was found that before the Yellow Automobile Company advertised price cuts, its daily business was about 400 yuan. After the price cuts, its daily business suddenly increased to more than 750 yuan. It was resolved to impose a fine of 350 yuan per day for a total of 1,050 yuan for the three days of the 10th, 21st, and 23rd. It is proposed to submit this fine to your bureau for transfer to the flood relief fund. Furthermore, the Liyi Automobile Company violated industry regulations earlier and has so far refused to comply with the order to correct its behavior. We request that your bureau revoke its business license in accordance with Article 13 of Chapter 5 of the industry regulations to serve as a warning. Whether this is appropriate, we have prepared this document for response, and we hope that you will review and approve it promptly for public convenience. Sincerely presented."</p>
<h3>Westerner's Employee Wrongly Accused and Commits Suicide: Xu Yishou, Honest but Deceived; Chen Amin Steals and Harms Others</h3>
<p>Xu Yishou, a native of Qingjiang, Jiangbei, about 30 years old, worked as a shop assistant at the home of a German named Siffin at 131 Baisezhong Road in the French Concession. He was known for his honesty, and therefore, he was deeply trusted by his employer. Two months ago, Siffin and his servant, Mou Jingshan, 36 years old, a native of Shandong, who served as the head steward and shop assistant, and Chen Linshi (a native of Fuzhou, an amah, etc.), went to Fuzhou to avoid the summer heat. They entrusted Xu Yishou to watch over their residence in Shanghai. Chen Linshi had a son named Chen Amin, who was 25 years old, did not engage in honest work, and was addicted to vagrancy. He was also light-fingered. Therefore, Siffin refused to allow Amin to enter the house to stay to prevent him from stealing. This time, Amin learned that Siffin's entire family and servants had gone to Min to avoid the summer heat, so he discussed with Xu about borrowing a room in Siffin's residence. Initially, Xu, due to his previous service with his mother, felt obligated to allow him to stay. However, Amin, after entering the house, had bad intentions. Taking advantage of Xu's unpreparedness, he made a key and opened the doors of Siffin's parlor, study, dining room, etc. He stole valuable typewriters, antiques, decorations, clothing, shoes, and other items, and sold them for cash, which he spent. Xu was completely unaware of this. On the 10th of this month, the owner, Siffin, returned to Shanghai from Min and discovered the loss. He questioned Xu, who then learned that Chen Amin had committed the theft. He truthfully reported this to Siffin. Siffin held Xu responsible and ordered him to negotiate with Chen Amin's mother, Chen Linshi, to find Amin. The two sides met and agreed on a time to meet, but Chen failed to keep the appointment. Xu was anxious and unable to face Siffin. Siffin called Xu to heat water for a bath, but there was no response for a long time. Siffin searched for him himself and found Xu hanging in the attic. He was already dead and beyond rescue. Siffin reported this to the Fuxu Patrol Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Funeral Home for examination.

<h3>Dismissed Employee Seeks Revenge with a Knife: Employers Must Be Cautious</h3>
<p>Huang Jihai, a native of Anhui, 26 years old, worked as a shop assistant at the home of a Westerner named Fox at 811 Judang Road in the French Concession. Recently, due to his improper behavior, he was dismissed by his employer. Huang held a grudge and, at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, hid a sharp knife, intending to attack his employer. He was discovered by his employer, who rushed to snatch the knife from him. The two then wrestled with each other, and Huang was injured. Subsequently, his employer reported the incident to the Beidang Road Patrol Station, which sent detectives to arrest Huang. After interrogation, Huang was charged with attempted murder and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment due to his injuries. Yesterday, the Patrol Station sent Huang's case file to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court.顾守熙, a lawyer from the police department, explained the case and requested a postponement until the defendant recovered from his injuries for interrogation. Judge Tu Gangxu reviewed the case and ordered that the case be re-examined on the morning of September 2.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens for the Murder of Lu Guixing: Court Conducts Separate Interrogations; Defendant's Testimony Evasive</h3>
<p>Lu Guixing, a native of Wuhu, residing at No. 3 Dexing Lane, Triangle Street, Hugun Camp, Nanshi, was stabbed to death on the fourth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar this year due to a dispute with Fan Guangyu and others over the settlement of accounts. Subsequently, the police arrested and transferred the defendants Fan Guangyu, Li Guitian, and Shu Sandou to the Prosecutor's Office of the District Court for interrogation and detention pending further investigation. These facts have been reported previously. It is now learned that the prosecutor has filed a public prosecution in this case. In addition, the deceased's wife, Lu Ni's, retained lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file a private prosecution, stating that she requested the defendants to jointly and severally compensate for the loss of clothing, coffins, funerals, and other expenses totaling 811.89 yuan. Furthermore, the plaintiff's family's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, as well as the education expenses of her children, all depended on her deceased husband. Now that he has been murdered by the defendants, the family's livelihood is unsustainable. She requested a joint and several payment of 2,000 yuan in consolation money. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge He opened the Twelfth Court for trial. To be cautious, the judge interrogated each defendant separately. The plaintiff, Lu Ni's, along with her children and lawyer Hu, arrived at the court and briefly recounted the events. The judge ordered that Fan Guangyu be brought to the dock. Fan Guangyu, 40 years old, a native of Shandong, claimed to be unable to make a living. On the fourth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, Foreman Chen Yaitou asked me to go to the Nanmatou Tea House to settle accounts. Chen Yaitou and Lu Guixing strongly demanded a commission, deducting 20 yuan for every 100 yuan. We did not agree. Chen Yaitou then used an iron rod to strike my head. Seeing the fierce situation, I wanted to dodge, but it was too late, so my left hand was injured. Next, Li Guiyong testified, 38 years old, also a native of Shandong, working as a laborer. When asked who killed Lu Guixing, he replied, "When Chen Yaitou was hitting Fan Guangyu with an iron rod, Lu Guixing was cutting me with a knife. At that time, I instinctively resisted with a bench. I don't know how Lu Guixing was injured." When asked, "Did you bring the knife?" he replied, "No, I live in Pudong. If I carried a weapon, I would have been arrested by the guards." Then, Chen Yaitou testified, 40 years old, currently a foreman. When asked, "Did you ask them to settle the accounts?" he replied, "Yes." When asked, "Why did a fight break out?" he replied, "When Fan Guangyu and others arrived, there were more than a dozen people. Seeing that the situation was not good, I went downstairs and went home. I hadn't gone far when a fight broke out in the tea house." When asked, "Who killed Lu Guixing?" he replied, "I don't know." When asked, "Did you hit Fan Guangyu's arm?" he replied, "I wasn't there, how could I hit him?" Finally, Shu Erbao testified, 28 years old, a native of Xinghua. When asked, "Were you there when the fight broke out?" he replied, "No." When asked, "Are you also a shareholder?" he replied, "No, my brother has shares." When asked, "Were you there that day?" he replied, "No, I went to Pudong." When asked, "Then why were you arrested?" he replied, "I was arrested when I returned home in the afternoon." After hearing the testimony, the judge ordered further investigation and retrial. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Sheng Zecheng Accused of Damaging Graves, Found Not Guilty; Sheng Files a Countersuit for False Accusation; Both Plaintiffs Also Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Sheng Zecheng, a native of Wugang, Changzhou, was recently sued by Xue Wanyu and Zhang Changbai, directors of the Ren'er Hall of the Lupu Shui Gongsuo in Jiangbei, for building houses on the Yichang land of the Gongsuo at the corner of Meibaige Road and Jing'an Temple Road, removing two coffins, and damaging graves. The case was heard several times in the First Special District Court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. He was ordered to summon the expert witness Du and others to the case for further verification. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao continued the trial in the Criminal Division II. The plaintiff's side claimed that at the time, Du Er instructed worker Wang Xiaoer to secretly check the land for two coffins, with or without bones. Many photos were taken of the wasteland on Aiwenyi Road and Kade Road. In court, Du Er could not be found for questioning. It was claimed that he could not be found. Worker Wang Xiaoer also excused himself due to illness. Wang Yuzhao, the owner of the construction company contracted to build the house, claimed that the house was built on August 26 by Aierde Foreign Company, with Sheng Juyou as the owner, and a contract was signed on July 8. The land had old houses demolished and leveled, and there were no graves used as foundations. When filling the land with lake soil, it was two feet deep, and there were no coffins or corpses. He presented the construction drawings of the foreign company and claimed that the like. Xue Wanyu and Zhang Changbai, the plaintiffs, insisted that there were photos of the coffins as evidence, and Sheng Xueyou needed to be summoned to the case. Sheng Zecheng was questioned and said that Xueyou went abroad on August 7, and the case had nothing to do with him. He was actually falsely accused and demanded a retrial of Xue and Zhang's crimes. He also retained lawyer Xu Shihao, who argued that the land had been previously sued in civil court, and the first trial had concluded, so it was no longer an issue. This time, the intentional criminal accusation was actually a matter of extortion, causing the client to innocently respond to the criminal court. All the witnesses, Du Er and Wang Xiaoer, are now absent, fabricating facts and forging photos. Moreover, the land had houses built on it as early as 1918. The land is located along the road, so how could there be graves on it? Before the incident, the client had no intention of reconciling with the other party. He now filed a countersuit for false accusation in accordance with Article 169 of the Criminal Law, requesting an investigation. Judge Xiao ruled that Sheng Zecheng, Xue Wanyu, and Zhang Changbai were all not guilty.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Yang Dize Travels to Sichuan and Tibet Three Times to Collect Exotic Birds and Animals for Specimens</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Yang Dize Kunxin embarked on the Min Sheng Shipping Company's Shui Nian wheel from Shanghai last night to enter Sichuan, then to Xikang and Tibetan border areas to collect birds and animals for specimens. Yang's trip was entrusted by an American charity. Yang had previously traveled to Sichuan, Kang, and Tibetan border areas twice to collect exotic birds and animals for specimens. This is his third trip. On the previous two trips, he brought his wife along. This time, his wife was unable to accompany him due to illness. Yang grew up in the United States and is not fluent in the language. However, Sichuan and Kang are his old haunts. The trip is scheduled to last ten months. After returning to Shanghai, he will immediately send the captured birds and animals to the United States for display.</p>
<h3>County-Owned: Pudong to Communicate with the City</h3>
<p>The Chenxing telephone in Shanghai County, having previously connected to the Sixth District of the two counties and to the various regions of the Southern County, reported to the Shanghai and Southern County governments and, in addition, asked the district chief of the district, Xing Zhigang, together with the Yangsi District Administration Committee member, Chen Zixin, requested the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to install a public telephone in the Yangsi District to connect with the various districts of Shanghai City or long-distance calls, and to benefit the development of local commerce. The bureau replied that it would be approved. Chen immediately prepared the formal procedures to request the installation. Chenxing Xing District Chief, that is, will consult with the Sanlin District Chief Chuan District Chief, sorting out the original routes of the four or five districts, which can directly reach Yangsi, and then connect to the Shanghai City telephone.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange: Ignoring Mortgage Disputes Heard Yesterday; Second Defendant is Zhang "Dan" Ru, Not Zhang "Wei" Ru; Exchange Denies Second Increase in Mortgage; Zhang Danru Also Files Lawsuit to Confirm Representation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange repeatedly mortgaged British registered property deeds to Englishman Lester for over 1.8 million, and after Lester's death, Morris and others, who were in charge of Lester's estate, sued the Exchange for not repaying the mortgage and for owing interest.  Yesterday's news reported this.  However, yesterday's report that the Chairman of the Exchange was Zhang Weiru was a rumor. Zhang is the Chairman of the Hankou Road Securities Exchange, and the one ignoring the mortgage is the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Jiangxi Road. It has nothing to do with Zhang and the Securities Exchange on Hankou Road. However, this newspaper omitted the word "Goods" in the headline, which may easily cause misunderstandings. In fact, the original plaintiff's complaint only listed Xue Zhusun as the defendant, and then Zhang Danru was added as the second defendant. The difference between "Dan" and "Wei" almost caused outsiders to be in a fog. Therefore, we are specifically making a correction. The reason why Zhang Danru was sued is because he represented the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange to mortgage the British registered property deeds to the plaintiff. In law, he is in the position of the main debtor. The plaintiff initially only wanted to sue the guarantor Xue Zhusun, but later believed that Danru should also bear important responsibility, so he was added to the defendants. Currently, the Exchange's board of directors stated that this mortgage was originally divided into two parts. The first part involved mortgaging five British registered property deeds, gradually mortgaging 1,188,811.19 yuan, which the Exchange entrusted Zhang Danru to represent. The second time, on September 16th, 1933, one British registered property deed, number 17, was added as collateral, and an additional 629,370.63 yuan in national currency was mortgaged. The Exchange denies entrusting Zhang Danru to handle it, saying that at that time, he was only ordered to negotiate with the mortgagee to extend the repayment period of the first mortgage, and was not asked to represent the Exchange to add collateral or increase the mortgage amount. Therefore, when Judge Shen Hong of the First Special District Court held a hearing on Thursday morning, the Exchange specially hired a lawyer to appear in court and raised the issue that Zhang Danru could not represent the Exchange. Although the lawyer was rejected by the court, the Exchange's attorney had already declared in court that he would appeal. It can be seen how much the Exchange values this point. Zhang Danru is particularly concerned about this issue, and has hired lawyer Wu Zhengsuito file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange to confirm the right to represent the mortgage. The First Special Court has scheduled Judge Mo to hold a hearing on the morning of the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Public Attention: High-Interest Exploitation Case; The Gallery Was Full; Debate Ends, Awaiting Sentencing; Trying on Clothes Caused Laughter</h3>
<p>Tangshan Road Zou Feng Pawnshop owner, Hongqing · North Henan Road Da Ji pawnshop owner Li Deyue, Huaihai Road Maowen pawnshop owner Weng Xuchen, Henan Road Quanxing pawnshop owner Tang Yaowei, Fujian Road Songtai pawnshop owner Zhou Songtai, were recently sued in criminal court by Jiang Chunqing, Shen Changshou, Chen Bianchu, Jiang Achu, Meng Ziyuan and five others, who jointly hired lawyer Le, accusing them of high-interest exploitation and violating Articles 344 and 345 of the Criminal Law. The details of the case, which has been tried once by the Special District Court, have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case reached</p>
<p>the stage of continued questioning.</p>
<p>However, since the implementation of the new criminal law, this type of high-interest criminal case is the first one accepted by the Special Court. Therefore, many people from all walks of life came to the court to observe, filling the gallery. At around 11:00 AM, Judge Feng Shi of the Criminal Court One took the bench. Both the plaintiffs and defendants arrived on time. The court questioned the defendants about the organization of the pawnshops. Later, the defendants' lawyer presented the clothes pawned by the plaintiffs, including Jiang Chunqing's long gown, Shen Changshou's</p>
<p>Western-style raincoat,</p>
<p>Chen Yichu's cloth bed sheet, Jiang Achu's cloth short shirt, and Meng Ziyuan's cloth short shirt and pants set. After examining them, the court immediately ordered the two plaintiffs, Jiang and Shen, to try them on to see if the pawned clothes were the correct items. However, because Shen was wearing a long gown, he was naturally unable to wear his pawned Western-style raincoat, and the size was also not a good fit. The spectators laughed at the sight. Subsequently,</p>
<p>a bailiff stopped them.</p>
<p>Shen also stated that the raincoat was borrowed from a friend and was not the item he pawned. Judge Feng determined that Jiang Achu and Meng Ziyuan's pawned items were old cloth short shirts, and ordered the bailiff to check them. The clothes they were wearing today were both spun silk and cotton short shirts and pants. Since the details of the case were clear, he ordered the debate to begin. First, the plaintiffs' lawyer stated, "The plaintiffs are all commoners who were forced to pawn their belongings due to livelihood difficulties, in order to address urgent needs. Unexpectedly, the defendants charged interest starting at two percent per period, with each ten days being one period, which means three periods per month, requiring</p>
<p>six percent interest.</p>
<p>If calculated annually, it would be 7.2%, which violates Articles 344 and 345 of the Criminal Law and should be punished according to the law." Next, the defendants' lawyers, Peng Qi and Yu Zhongluo, stated, "The plaintiffs are suing under Articles 144 and 345 of the Criminal Law. Article 344 states, 'Whoever takes advantage of another's urgency, rashness, or inexperience to lend money or other items and obtain significantly</p>
<p>disproportionate</p>
<p>high interest compared to the principal shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year, detention, or a fine of not more than one thousand yuan, or both.' This clearly stipulates that it is necessary to take advantage of another's urgency. However, according to pawnshop practices, items are pawned based on the item itself and redeemed with a pawn ticket. Therefore, the name of the pawner and the purpose of the pawned funds are never asked or known. Whether they use the money to buy rice or gamble, the pawnshop has no way of knowing. This</p>
<p>clearly does not conform</p>
<p>to the criminal law. Moreover, the plaintiffs have all been interrogated and stated that they were not incited. How could they all hire lawyer Le to send a warning letter on the same date? Furthermore, one person pawned an item on the 23rd, and the pawnshop received the lawyer's letter on the same day, which is clearly</p>
<p>premeditated.</p>
<p>This point should be noted. Furthermore, the Civil Code stipulates that the maximum interest rate should not exceed 2%, but</p>
<p>even if it exceeds</p>
<p>that, it only means that there is no right to claim. For example, if the pawner does not redeem, the pawnshop has no right to demand repayment. Furthermore, the criminal law stipulates obtaining illegal high interest. Since the plaintiffs have not redeemed their items, there are no losses. The defendants should be declared innocent." Judge Feng then announced the conclusion of the case and scheduled sentencing for next Monday morning.</p>

<h3>Xie Kang Sheng Fire; Two Bodies Pulled Out; Burned Beyond Recognition</h3>
<p>The awning built in the courtyard of Xie Kang Sheng Southern Goods Store at No. 243 Caishi Street, west of Xilaihuo Street, in the French Concession, suddenly caught fire and burned at 0:20 AM on the 22nd. The store employees were all asleep and no one noticed. The fire quickly spread to the store and four neighboring houses. The fire department rushed to extinguish the fire. When the fire was raging, several employees of Xie Kang Sheng were unable to escape and died in the fire. After the fire, the fire department sent people to turn over the rubble. At 3:00 PM, two male bodies were found. The two corpses were tightly embracing each other. After being separated and identified by the employees who escaped from the store, one was identified as Yu Zhizhang, the 28-year-old bookkeeper from Ningbo, and the other was Xu Youqing, a 22-year-old apprentice from Suqian. Both corpses were burned beyond recognition and were extremely gruesome. In addition, due to being exposed to fire and two days of heat, the bodies had become foul and decayed. The supervising Mailan police station notified the Tongren Fuyuan branch to send laborers to carry the corpses to the morgue. The detectives were also sent to notify the families of the two corpses to report the case, pending the dispatch of personnel from the Second Special Court for inspection this morning. It is reported that Xie Kang Sheng Southern Goods Store has fire insurance of 18,000 taels. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire to verify the case. In addition, the residence of Zhang Zhicheng at No. 2 Yuqing Lane behind the store was also affected, suffering considerable water damage.</p>
<h3>Xu Lai Crowning Ceremony; Social Bureau Orders Suspension</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau yesterday ordered the Preparatory Committee for the Crowning Ceremony of Xu Lai, the "Oriental Standard Beauty," stating: "Upon reviewing newspaper reports regarding the so-called 'Preparatory Committee for the Crowning Ceremony of Xu Lai, the Oriental Standard Beauty,' the name of the committee is inappropriate, and there is no responsible initiator, which is already not in compliance. Furthermore, according to reports, the clothing and equipment prepared for the ceremony are extremely extravagant and wasteful. As for the remaining proceeds from the committee's ticket sales, how much will actually be used for relief? This action by the committee is clearly misleading the public and is related to public morals. It cannot be disguised under the name of relief. Therefore, it is hereby ordered that you immediately cease the event. Failure to comply is not permitted."</p>

It is heard that the goods that the store added from the German factory have already arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Kuizhao Road Corpse Relocation Case Continues: Culprit Rickshaw Puller Guiltily Flees; Remaining Suspects' Confessions Already Clarified</h3>
<p>On the 19th of this month, Wu Kezhong and Chu Jingwu, the chief and deputy detectives of the City Center Branch of the Zhou Detective Team, received a confidential report stating that the unidentified male corpse discovered in the ditch at the intersection of Jiangwan Kuizhao Road and Jiangchang Road on the afternoon of the 10th of this month was struck and killed by a brick-carrying truck from the Lu Gen Ji Cart Company (vehicle license numbers are 12014 in the Chinese area and 16054 in the concession). It was then disposed of at that location in an attempt to conceal the crime. Upon receiving the report, the team immediately waited near Xianshan Road. As expected, the truck with the aforementioned license plate passed by, but the original red and black paint had been changed to green. The detective team immediately impounded the vehicle along with eight individuals, including the driver and laborers.  Upon questioning, it was discovered that the rickshaw puller responsible for the accident had already fled out of guilt. However, Shi Guoliang, a bookkeeper, was also on the truck at the time. Shi lives at 426 Alabaster Road in the British Concession. After learning this, the team reported to Chief Huang Qiguang, who rushed to the concession and, together with the Haining Road police, went to 426 Alabaster Road and arrested Shi Guoliang. He was taken back to the Haining Road police station. The next day, the police escorted him to the First Special District Local Court, which ordered him to be handed over to Wang Yao, the foreman, and Li Bingsen, a detective, of the City Center Detective Team, for interrogation. After the detectives brought him back, Zhang Guirong, a member of the branch bureau, interrogated Shi Guoliang, who confessed that he was 21 years old, from Shaoxing, and worked for the Lu Gen Ji Cart Company. At 2 p.m. on the 10th of this month, I was riding in a truck driven by Jiang Asi towards Zhenru. I was sitting next to the driver. While passing the Xiaoyang Bridge on Jiaotong Road, the wheels ran over and killed someone. I told Asi to report it to the local police, but he said not to. They, three or four people, lifted the deceased onto the truck. I also said to report to the boss, but he refused. He drove the truck straight to the intersection of Jiangwan Kuizhao Road and Jiangchang Road and dumped the deceased in the ditch. Asi also said to me, "Whoever dares to report, I will deal with them." Laborer Hou Guisheng confessed that he was 40 years old, from Taixing, and lived at 17 Fuxiang Lane, Tian Road. At 2 p.m. on the 10th of this month, our company's truck was carrying bricks to Zhenru. At Xiaoyang Bridge, we ran over and injured someone. Jiang Asi, Shi Guoliang, myself, and an unnamed laborer lifted the injured person onto the truck. Shi Guoliang and Asi said they would take him to the hospital, but Asi turned the truck around and drove straight to the countryside of Jiangwan, where he abandoned the injured person in the ditch. Because of business matters, I did not dare to report. Driver Yang Shaowen confessed that he was 29 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived at 441 Tokyo Road. A few days ago, a friend named Wang San came to me and said that Jiang Asi, a driver for Lu Gen Ji, had caused an accident and asked me to fill in for him. I don't know anything else. Laborers Yuan Changxing, 38 years old, from Yancheng, living at 15 Chang'an Lane, Manzhou Road; Wu Buyuan, 34 years old, from Taizhou, living at the Qiaozhen Road Bridge, Guangfu Road; Lu San, 38 years old, from Taixing, living at 75 Jian, 18 Qichang Warehouse, Pudong; and Huang Er, 45 years old, from Yangzhou, living in a thatched shed at the Sun Temple, all gave testimonies that shifted blame. Pan Miaoyuan, 28 years old, from Nantong, living at 2, Lane 284, Qipu Road, a kiln goods dealer, confessed that he hired a Lu Gen Ji truck to transport bricks to the Tang Yuxing Construction Company on Qiujiang Road, but he did not know about the running-over incident. After the interrogating official verified the confessions, since the rickshaw puller Jiang Asi was on the run and the car company owner Lu Gensheng had also not been found, in addition to requesting the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to issue arrest warrants for Jiang Asi and Lu Gensheng, Shi Guoliang, Hou Guisheng, Yang Shaowen, and a total of nine laborers suspected of being involved were sent, along with the truck, to the Public Security Bureau, who transferred them to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Kang Le Special Edition</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Dun Gen</p>
<p>The Kang Le Special Edition is not an advertisement. Kang Le is certainly not a quit-smoking drug. Readers of the newspaper, upon seeing the title "Kang Le Special Edition," without careful consideration, may rashly conclude: "This is an advertisement for a quit-smoking drug from the Kang Le Pharmaceutical Factory." Discarding it without a second glance would be a disservice to the hard work of the editors and publishers. Kang Le, after all, is the sole demand of human life. Seeking it without the proper methods can lead to the opposite result. The purpose of this publication is to gather collective wisdom and offer the people of the nation methods to improve health and obtain happiness: How to cultivate one's character, how to strengthen the body, how to develop a career, and how to enhance one's reputation. In addition to researching hygiene and discussing social customs, it also contains interesting articles to pique the reader's interest and alleviate mental fatigue, which is also a way to create Kang Le. As for Kang Le Su, it is one of the latest inventions in the modern pharmaceutical world, a major tonic. Its functions are so extraordinary that they are difficult to describe on paper. Whether old or young, male or female, all can take or inject it. If one persists with faith, it can truly cure diseases, prolong life, and bring about rebirth. The fundamental element of human life is a Golgi body that develops in the cells of various parts, making people mentally excited and physically strong. Those who are congenitally deficient or weakened by prolonged illness, especially opium smokers, have an abnormally low supply of Golgi bodies. They must rely on opium or similar substances to stimulate and extract it, which is like overdrawing from a bank and will eventually lead to bankruptcy. However, by taking Kang Le Su, the Golgi bodies will naturally regenerate and replenish, gradually becoming abundant, no different from a healthy person. There is no need to rely on opium. Therefore, I say that Kang Le Su can cure all diseases and restore health; it is not specifically a drug for quitting smoking. However, it has been tested in quitting smoking and has been found to be the fastest and most effective. People therefore regard it as a quit-smoking drug. The manufacturer, Dr. Tang Jiazhen, and the publisher, Mr. Chen Xiaodie, deeply lament the large number of compatriots trapped by opium. Since the public praises Kang Le Su for its miraculous effect in curing opium addiction and recognizes it as a wonderful quit-smoking remedy, we may as well regard ourselves as a quit-smoking drug and first focus on rescuing compatriots from the clutches of addiction. Furthermore, opium is a major obstacle to our country's poverty and weakness, preventing us from enjoying a single day of Kang Le. Public officials are heartbroken and have issued repeated orders, saying: "External threats are not to be feared, internal chaos is not to be worried about. Only opium smokers bear the responsibility for national subjugation and extinction." Therefore, the treatment of opium addicts should be merciless. However, opium addicts themselves also have a belly full of grievances, shedding tears and bowing their heads without daring to speak. Their meaning is: "I am using my own money to smoke my own opium, harming no one and competing with no one. The principle of law is that harming others is a crime. Not only am I not harming public morality or disturbing public order, but I am also contributing to military and political expenses through heavy taxes. Why am I violating the law and living in constant fear?" In this environment, who wouldn't want to quit? However, most are entangled by illness, and modern doctors are often hasty, failing to understand the suffering of those quitting smoking, and there is no fundamental remedy for the physical weakness. This leads to those who want to quit hesitating, and those who have quit eventually relapsing. The purpose of our editing the Kang Le Special Edition is to report to smoking compatriots the miraculous effects of Kang Le Su, which can replenish the body, cure diseases completely. Since there is such a wonderful medicine, why hesitate to quit? On the one hand, it is to assist the government's anti-smoking efforts, and on the other hand, it is to speak for the endless grievances of smoking compatriots, expressing what they want to say. Every word strikes the hearts of the readers, so that there is no doubt about the belief in Kang Le Su. You can also submit articles, each stating your experience with smoking, various different illnesses, so that the depression in your chest can be vented to the fullest, and your spirit will be refreshed. Then, taking Kang Le Su to quit smoking will be even more effective. Therefore, at the beginning of the publication of the Kang Le Special Edition, there are many discussions about quitting smoking, and later it gradually extends to all other health issues. It is hoped that readers of the newspaper will not mistake it for an ordinary quit-smoking drug advertisement, which is not interesting, and ignore it, then the editors will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Kang Le Egg Yolk Su Benefits People</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<h3>The Principle of Egg Yolk Su for Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Tang Jiazhen</p>
<p>According to Dr. Tang, this article has already been printed in the Kang Le Su instruction manual and various newspapers. The writings of many medical experts have quoted it. This journal is specially re-publishing it. According to observations by scholars from various countries over the years, the tissues and cells of the human body contain a major component called the "Golgi body." The quantity of Golgi bodies varies in different parts of the body, with the most abundant being in the brain and nerves. The chemical composition of this body is lipids, i.e., egg yolk lipids, etc.</p>
<p>Since Professor Ma Wenzhao's in-depth research over the years, it has been discovered that when the "Golgi body" increases in various cells, a person's spirit is vigorous, their thoughts are innovative, and the movement of their limbs is also exceptionally pleasant. Conversely, the body is tired and exhausted, the whole body is sore and lazy, and there is no vitality.</p>
<p>The effects of opium, morphine, red pills, and heroin are to stimulate the red blood cells in the blood, causing them to produce a large number of "platelets." Platelets contain nothing other than these lipids. Several types of white blood cells in the blood take this substance and transport it to various organs. After the cells of various organs obtain these lipids, they create the "Golgi body" within their bodies. From this perspective, the "Golgi body" increased by opium, etc., is entirely produced by its stimulating effect. After smoking or injecting for a long time, these lipids cannot circulate without the help of opium or morphine. Therefore, once smoking or injecting is stopped, the number of "platelets" greatly decreases. The white blood cells consequently stop carrying them in the blood vessels and do not perform their transport work. The cells of various organs naturally have no way to absorb these lipids, so the original "Golgi body" also greatly reduces its quantity or disappears completely, and a person's spirit and body exhibit various states of unease.</p>
<p>The special effect of egg yolk su on quitting smoking is because its components are similar to the elements contained in platelets, both being lipids. After taking this su, white blood cells can directly extract lipids from the intestines and deliver them to the cells of various organs. After the cells obtain this large amount of lipids, they can carry out their normal work. On the one hand, there is no need to indirectly extract them from red blood cells, so red blood cells can rest and increase their effectiveness.</p>
<p>During the period when we take egg yolk su, the "Golgi body" can directly extract lipids from the intestines and increase its quantity, so it can break away from the control of opium, etc. Once opium, morphine, red pills, or heroin are reduced or even discarded, the "Golgi body" will not have to worry about decreasing or disappearing because it has sufficient egg yolk su as its backing, thus achieving the goal of physiological smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Egg yolk su is also a major tonic. It has long been used by doctors in various countries for neurasthenia, first and second stage anemia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and weakness. Its function is also to replenish the lipids in the cells. When the lipids in the cells are full, the physical strength is replenished, the spirit is vigorous, and the resistance to microorganisms is greatly increased, so it can eliminate its toxins, and the symptoms gradually decrease and reach a state of health.</p>
<p>Kang Le Su is a self-made product of the Kang Le Pharmaceutical Factory, extracted from fresh chicken egg yolks, containing more than 90% of animal egg yolk lipids, is a semi-solid, deep yellow in color, odorless and tasteless. All raw materials are completely domestic, fresh and pure, far superior to any imported products.</p>
<h3>Cultivating Original Qi and Improving Health</h3>
<p>— Wu Xing</p>
<h3>Gospel of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>— Wang</p>
<p>Human bodies are born with varying degrees of strength. Turning weakness into strength relies on medicinal power to regulate and clarify the mind. A single wonderful plan.</p>
<p>The Kang Le of the family, its effect is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Notice to Readers</h3>
<p>— Xiaodie</p>
<p>Since the release of Kang Le Su, the number of people who have quit smoking effectively has exceeded expectations. For example, according to the instructions, it is expected to take at least twenty or thirty days to quit, but in fact, some people quit in just ten days. However, there are also those who quit two-thirds of the way, then gradually slow down and cannot completely break the habit immediately. We feel that this is not about the effectiveness of the medicine, but rather about the firmness of the inner confidence of the person quitting smoking. To strengthen the confidence of the person quitting smoking, it is especially important to fully understand the quit-smoking products they are using. On the one hand, the manufacturer must have sufficient continuous improvement and research. Because the bodies of people quitting smoking are different, the symptoms that occur due to quitting smoking are also different. We sincerely hope that those taking Kang Le Su will provide us with a report on their experience. Even those who are taking other medications to quit smoking can also discuss it with us. We not only hope to receive endorsements from those who recognize Kang Le Su as a good quit-smoking drug, but also hope to receive criticism from those who are dissatisfied with Kang Le Su. Because the original intention of creating Kang Le Su was to help smokers escape the sea of suffering, not to seek profit, we have decided to sacrifice a large advertising space to edit a special publication. We hope that all gentlemen with the heart to quit smoking will contribute articles and express their personal opinions as much as possible, so that everyone can unite to reject drugs and complete the work of quitting smoking. Then, this publication will have great hope.</p>
<h3>Identification of Egg Yolk Lipids</h3>
<p>— (Brief)</p>
<p>Egg yolk lipids can be obtained from three substances: one is animal brain matter, the second is egg yolk, and the third is soybeans. Among the three, the most effective is the egg yolk lipids in egg yolk. According to the results of many scholars' tests, egg yolk lipids are indeed a powerful tonic, as mentioned earlier. Even people without nicotine addiction can freely consume them. Naturally, their weight will increase, their thinking will be sharp, and their complexion will be radiant. Moreover, it is absolutely non-toxic and has no side effects. Therefore, egg yolk lipids are not only a quit-smoking product, but also an important tonic.</p>
<p>However, some products sold on the market are not extracted from pure egg yolks. A list is specially made to clarify this.</p>
<h3>Simple Method for Quitting Smoking with Kang Le Su:</h3>
<p>For people with nicotine addiction, taking this su for five days can make the effects circulate throughout the body, reducing the amount of smoking by one-quarter. After taking it for ten days, the amount of smoking can be reduced by two-quarters. After taking it for half a month, the amount of smoking can be reduced by three-quarters. After taking it for twenty days, the nicotine addiction is completely eliminated, with no pain. After taking it for one month, the body is completely restored to health and strength, and there is a natural aversion to smoke. If you can continue to take three or four pills regularly as a tonic, you will not only have permanent Kang Le, but you will also feel nauseous when you smell the smell of opium smoke, and you will naturally avoid it. Even long-term addiction will not recur. Refer to the table on the left for the amount to take.</p>
<p>Boxed Instructions for Smoking Cessation: Take with warm water three times daily after meals. As a tonic: Take two pills three times daily.</p>
<h3>A Study of the Origins of Opium</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiannong</p>
<p>The import of opium into China began during the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty. According to previous notes, "Arab" merchants first imported poppy juice into China for medical treatment of diseases, which was quite effective. Another theory is that during the Qianfeng era of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, the "Fumo Kingdom" in the Western Regions sent envoys to offer "Diyejia." This Diyejia is another name for opium, just as we call it "Fushou Gao" or "Afurong." If this theory is accurate, then it is even earlier than the Zhenyuan era. However, there is little proof in the official history. In short, China certainly had this drug in the late Tang Dynasty, and the Chinese people themselves were able to grow it at that time. According to verifiable records, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opium in Tang Dynasty poems: The poet Yong Tao wrote a poem "Returning West to Xiegou" saying:</p>
<p>Walking through dangerous passes, emerging from Xiegou,</p>
<p>After experiencing flat rivers, it feels like returning home.</p>
<p>Endless sorrows of travelers dissipate today,</p>
<p>The mita nang flower is first seen before the horse.</p>
<p>Also, Li Zhenbai's "Ode to Poppy Seeds" says:</p>
<p>Inverted rows of Shuanglu pieces, sparsely inserted jasper chips.</p>
<p>Like sacrificial cow's milk, and like a bell and horse bag.</p>
<p>Drumsticks and waterfall arrows, there is a reason for everything.</p>
<p>From the above two poems, there is no doubt that opium flowed into the Central Plains during the late Tang Dynasty. Mita nang flower is poppy flower. Poppy juice is the raw material for manufacturing opium soil. However, initially, opium was imported into China as a valuable medicinal product.</p>
<p>Opium in Buddhist books: The Tang Dynasty translation of the Buddhist book "Vinaya Miscellaneous Matters" also contains this record: "If a Buddhist is sick, he can smoke. The method is to combine two bowls, punch a hole in the bottom, put fire and medicine in the middle, and then put an iron pipe about a foot long in the hole to inhale." This method of smoking is actually the precursor to later lamps.</p>
<p>Su Dongpo and opium: The great Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo also wrote about this drug, such as:</p>
<p>Taoist priests advise drinking Jisu water, boys can decoct poppy soup.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a special collection of poems about this drug, named "Planting Medicinal Seedlings," which specifically praises poppies and the consumption of poppy soup, etc. It is thought that opium was extremely rare and precious in the Tang and Song dynasties. By the Ming Dynasty, although it had spread to the folk, it was still not as much as it is now. The "Da Ming Huidian" records that various countries offered tribute, such as Siam and Java, all offering opium. During the Chenghua era, the imperial edict instructed people to buy opium, the value of which was similar to gold, which shows how precious it was. More than a hundred years later, in the seventeenth year of Emperor Shenzong's Wanli reign, the tariff table recorded that two catties of opium were worth two silver treasures. Since then, the import of opium has been continuous, and the price has gradually decreased. Examining the history of foreign trade in China, the Portuguese were the earliest. In the middle of the Ming Dynasty, they came to reside in Macau and seized the hegemony of trade in East Asia. Opium was indeed their major commodity. Therefore, the people of Guangdong were the first to suffer from its poison. By the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the potential of British trade in East Asia gradually expanded, so they transported opium from India to China. However, at that time, they used the excuse of medicine to treat diseases. Our rulers only knew to levy import taxes and never thought it was a drug. Moreover, only the people in Guangdong and other coastal areas consumed it, so people in the interior rarely paid attention to it or opposed it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from the Poppy Pavilion (1)</h3>
<p>— Dun Gen</p>
<p>The name Poppy Pavilion was changed by Xiaodie. I don't want to be the Chu Hegemon. Just kidding.</p>
<p>Strange Habits</p>
<p>Smoking opium is a major habit. If done in conjunction with other things, it will also become a secondary habit. Some people must drink tea while smoking. Some eat sweets. Still others must eat gelded pigs. I once saw a friend who had to drink a large bowl of extremely strong liquor and a large bowl of fatty meat every time he smoked. A certain notebook recorded that a person had a beloved son who was only five years old. He often played in front of the opium couch. His father would order him to do a somersault once and would reward him with a mouthful of opium. Later, when this son grew up, he also became a major addict. Every time he smoked, he had to do a somersault on the spot, otherwise he would not feel satisfied. Another person, in his youth, secretly smoked opium behind closed doors. Afraid of being discovered by his parents, he often went to the side of the door and spied out of the gap to see if his parents were coming. Later, he became heavily addicted. Even after his parents died, he still frequently jumped up and went to peek through the door gap when he smoked, otherwise he could not get his fill. It is also heard that a certain famous lady must dismiss people and lock the door when she smokes, and strip off all her clothes, not wearing a thread. Then, she would lift her feet up high and smoke madly, making the whole room hazy, burying her whole body in the smoke. Only then would she feel satisfied.</p>
<p>Smoking Like Crazy</p>
<p>When Lin Wenzhong banned opium, offenders were often beheaded. It is said that a soldier was ordered to guard the unburied corpses of those who had been beheaded at night. Wenzhong happened to come out on patrol and saw this soldier lighting a lamp and smoking in the pile of corpses, using a human head as a pillow. He was beheaded as well. This soldier can be said to have been unafraid of death, truly having the spirit of "the head can be cut off, but opium cannot be missed." However, this shows that it is useless to strictly ban opium with harsh punishments without finding a fundamental way out of addiction for opium addicts.</p>
<h3>Another Crocodile Captured in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Shao Zhangsheng and Zhang Heshang, two people from Jiangbei living at 8 Qin Yuli, inside the Pudong Ice Factory, discovered a strange beast on the afternoon of the previous day on the Bund between Guangdong Road and the Yangjingbang River, crawling on the surface of the water. They quickly lashed two boats together, then used a rope to lasso its waist. After exerting a lot of effort, they were finally able to pull it up. Upon inspection, it was confirmed to be a crocodile, attracting the attention of pedestrians on the shore. A large crowd gathered to watch for a while. The two men thought it was a rare commodity, so they hurriedly carried it home and placed it in a long tub to rest quietly in the water. It was found that the fish was about five Chinese feet long, had four legs and a long tail, was completely black, and the back part was clearly a rectangular block shape. The head was about one foot long, and its shape was very similar to a pangolin. It was quite docile, ate meat, and its cry was extremely small, like a ghost's wail. At night, its nasal sounds were like thunder, as if an old man was snoring. Those who went to see it every day were numerous, all finding it rare and strange. It has been reported a few days ago that someone also caught a crocodile on the Bund of Guangdong Road, which can be said to be not unique.</p>

<h3>Football Authority Donghua Team: Plans to Withdraw from the Western Union This Session</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Union Football Association has made considerable efforts in holding football league matches in the past. The football season of this year is approaching. The Western Union has begun active preparations, and invitations to old members were sent out by the secretariat the day before yesterday. The Donghua Club, the only strong football team in Shanghai, has also received this invitation. However, according to those close to Donghua, the problem of the venue has been resolved, so it has been decided not to participate in the Western Union this year. It is heard that the new venue has been set near Shanzhong Road, Xiahui Road, and construction will begin soon. If it is limited by economic or time constraints, then it is decided to take a break for a season this year. If this move is realized, then there will be a new environment in the Shanghai football world, and the Western Union will suffer a major blow. It is heard that the reason for Donghua's withdrawal this year is not only dissatisfaction with the Western Union in various aspects, but the biggest reason is still the unexpected incident that occurred in the previous session.</p>
<h3>National Table Tennis Competition - Tianjin, Jiangxi, and Guangdong Provinces Send Letters to Participate - Enthusiastic Registration for Preliminary Selections in This City</h3>
<p>Following the launch of the national table tennis competition by the Shanghai Chinese Table Tennis Association and Allied Associations, letters have been successively received from various regions, including Tianjin, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Beijing, Wuhan, Jiangsu, Hangzhou, and Xiamen, requesting to participate. Preliminary selections in Shanghai began on the 20th, and registration has been quite enthusiastic. Participants already include Lu Zhongqiu, Le Junchang, Ma Tingliang, Gui Weimin, Liu Longzhou, Ye Shucun, Lu Hanjun, Deng Guofu, Fang Keping, Lu Xiulu, Ye Xiuzhang, Dong Zaiqing, Liu Jihan, and over ten others. It is reported that the registration period ends at 7 PM on the 25th of this month, with no extensions. Below is a copy of the letter sent to various provinces and cities regarding participation in the national competition:</p>
<p>Respectfully informing, our association considers table tennis to be a modern, scientific, and popular sport, and various countries around the world are vigorously promoting it. However, in our country's past National Games, although most ball sports have been included, table tennis has been neglected. Our association believes that this sport is important for international competition and should be encouraged by the government. Therefore, we submitted a request to the organizing committee of the current National Games to formally include it as a competition item to encourage its development. This was approved, and we were instructed to organize a performance at a designated location and time. Now, our association, to conduct an open selection and facilitate mutual communication, has decided through a resolution of its executive committee to establish a championship and invite athletes from various provinces and cities to Shanghai to participate in the national table tennis competition (each province or city to send one team, consisting of one leader and five players). This will gather the best table tennis players from across the country in one place and initiate an unprecedented grand event, ensuring that talent is recognized and few gems are missed. The most outstanding players will then perform at the National Games. Knowing that your region promotes table tennis with great effort, we are sending this special letter to inform you. At that time, we kindly request that your region coordinate with various counties in your province to select athletes to come to Shanghai to participate. We are greatly looking forward to it. Enclosed is a copy of the Shanghai preliminary selection regulations for your reference. Please also inform us of the progress in your region at any time. Furthermore, members who have joined the All-China Federation will have their room and board in Shanghai during the competition period provided by our association. This is for your information.</p>

<h3>Simplified Characters Promulgated by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments of all provinces and cities on the 21st, stating: Chinese characters have long been difficult and complex. Over thousands of years, from pictographic characters to seal script, clerical script, cursive script, and finally to the current traditional characters, all have evolved from complex to simple, from convoluted to straightforward, and from strange to plain. The traces of this evolution are clearly visible. However, while traditional characters are simpler than the original ancient seal script and clerical script, recognizing and writing them remains difficult. Previous generations recognized this and often used simplified characters in official and private documents. Simplified characters are also frequently seen in memorials, classics, and correspondence. The Ming Dynasty scholar Huang Zongxi strongly advocated for the use of simplified characters, stating that they "can save half the effort." While the general public often cannot read books written in traditional characters, they can easily understand novels and handwritten bills published in simplified characters. This shows that simplified characters have a deep and widespread foundation and utility among both scholars and the general public, which is a clear fact.</p>
<p>In recent years, although the government and society have longed to popularize compulsory education and mass education, the results have not been significant. While there are many reasons for this, the complexity of the characters is a major one. Therefore, those discussing the popularization of education mostly advocate selecting the most common simplified characters and applying them to education to remedy the situation and facilitate progress. This was formally proposed at the First National Education Conference convened by the former University Council. In recent years, researchers in the academic community who study character reform have also proposed plans to promote simplified characters and requested their adoption. The Ministry, considering this a major matter, conducted thorough research and deliberation, submitting the issue to the former National Language Unification Preparatory Committee for detailed review. At the same time, it sought the opinions of other experts. The former National Language Unification Preparatory Committee then submitted a report stating that simplifying characters would greatly benefit the future of culture. Other experts also stated that since national education needs to be popularized quickly, adopting simplified characters to promote popularization is imperative. Considering the urgent need and the consensus of opinions, the Ministry formulated three principles for promoting simplified characters, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for discussion and resolution, and then the Yuan submitted them to the Central Political Conference for approval. After the case was approved, the Ministry entrusted the former National Language Unification Preparatory Committee to carefully select and stipulate the following as standards for selecting simplified characters: "(1) Adhere to the principle of 'transmitting but not creating'; (2) Select the simplified characters that are most commonly used in society for initial adoption; (3) Characters with very few strokes in their original form will not be further simplified." Subsequently, the former National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, based on these standards, drafted a list of simplified characters and submitted it. After careful review by the Ministry, the first batch of the most commonly used simplified characters was compiled.</p>
<p>In addition to the measures for promoting simplified characters in education, which have been carefully formulated by the Ministry in accordance with the centrally approved plan and ordered to be implemented by the provincial and municipal education administrative agencies for schools and publishing agencies to follow and adopt, the Ministry will separately submit a request to the Executive Yuan for transmission to the National Government to order the adoption of simplified characters in official documents and public announcements. Attached is a copy of the first batch of simplified character list for general information. This order is hereby issued. (Attached is the list of simplified characters as above.)</p>
<h3>Flexible Measures for Separate Education of Boys and Girls in Ping City</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd) Due to various difficulties in implementing the separate education of boys and girls in secondary schools in Ping City, it is not easy to complete it in a short time. The municipal government has now decided on the following flexible measures: (1) All private co-educational secondary schools must not enroll female students from this year onwards. Those who have already been enrolled should be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, which will find ways to place them; (2) Existing female students in the second and third grades of junior and senior high schools in each school are temporarily allowed to remain in their original schools to study until graduation, which will be completed by the end of the 25th academic year. If there are more than 25 female students in each grade, they should be taught in separate classes. If there are fewer than 25, they are temporarily allowed to attend classes together. However, from this year onwards, absolutely no new female students should be enrolled into any grade. Female students who have already registered with the bureau for transfer should be properly placed by the bureau. Those who wish to return to their original schools to study are allowed to do so.</p>

<h3>Little Boys (24)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Mrs. Pei tried her best to create various methods to promote their health. The real sons also loved and treated him well. However, he didn't like their active behavior and just sat quietly watching the pigeons, sometimes for hours. Sometimes he poked a hole in the ground for Tandy until the enthusiastic little driller felt he had had enough. Sometimes he followed Rice, the farmhand, around and around, watching him work because honest Rice treated him well. Although Bilan had forgotten his words, he could remember the friendly faces.</p>
<p>Pon Tao Mo was the troublemaker in the school and had been the most unbearable little troublemaker since birth. He could tease people like a monkey, but he had a good heart, so people couldn't help but forgive his cunning. Messy and chaotic, everything said to him was like wind in his ears, but when he swore to heaven that he would repent and start anew, or proposed all kinds of strange and unusual punishments to redeem himself, he felt that he was so deeply remorseful for every mistake that it was not easy to hold him to his strict words. Because of him, Mr. and Mrs. Pei were always preparing for all kinds of unexpected events, from Tao Mo breaking his own neck to the entire school being blown up by gunpowder. Nasuit set up a drawer with bandages, plasters, and ointments specially for him because Tao Mo often encountered dangers and was carried in half-dead. But nothing had ever killed him. After suffering a setback, he tried again and again, and his spirit was twice as strong as before.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<h3>After the Announcement of the U.S. Cotton Nine-Tenths Loan, Cotton Yarn Sees a Shocking Price Drop; Bullish Positions Collapse and Are Painfully Cut; No. 3 Cotton Yarn Plummets by Eight or Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market suffered a major setback, with an unusually fierce price drop. This was due to the U.S. cotton loan rate being changed from one and two-tenths to nine-tenths of a cent for the pledge. As this news spread, the market was thrown into panic, sentiment was shaken, bullish positions became unsustainable, and the line of defense collapsed, causing the market to plummet. The price dropped sharply from three yuan four jiao to two yuan eight jiao. It is said that Changfeng released 10,000 bales in one day.</p>
<h3>The Price of Golden Rooster Cotton Yarn Falls by More Than Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Before the market opened for standard cotton yarn, news of the changes to the U.S. cotton loan pledge procedures arrived, and the situation in the market changed dramatically. Selling pressure surged, and the initial price dropped sharply by one yuan seven, eight, or nine jiao. By the second and third rounds of trading, news arrived that Osaka No. 3 cotton yarn had plummeted by six, seven, or nine yuan. For a time, the atmosphere was chaotic, and sellers swarmed in. The market was overwhelmed with selling pressure and became increasingly difficult to support. Prices for all months broke through the 70-yuan mark together. As a result, all months fell by three yuan four jiao to two yuan seven jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market opened steadily in the afternoon. Inland factories profited from extensive short covering, and the market recovered slightly. However, by the second and third rounds of trading, weakness was seen, and the market fell again due to further cutting of bullish positions. However, manufacturers continued to resist short positions. The market recovered slightly at the close. As a result, all months rose or fell by one, two, or three jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yugang sold 1,150 bales, Dafeng 1,150 bales, Zhenda 1,900 bales, Gengfeng 1,050 bales, Ruida 2,650 bales, Gu Da 1,150 bales, Changfeng 10,200 bales, Xincheng 750 bales, and Da Ji 5,500 bales.

<h3>Spot Cotton Yarn Also Falls by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Sales of spot cotton yarn remain flat. According to statistics, various merchants bought a total of 400 bales throughout the day. The spot market had been firm for many days, and cotton merchants were pulling prices up strongly. Now, impacted by the U.S. cotton news like a bolt from the blue, bullish investors were heavily hit. Many painfully cut their positions, leading to a market sell-off. It is said that bullish investors cut a massive 40,000 to 50,000 dan.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Distant-Month Cotton Plummets by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Before the market opened for standard cotton, news of the lowered U.S. cotton loan pledge spread, causing fear. No. 3 cotton fell nearly four yuan in the near month and three yuan six jiao in the distant month. Sellers surged like a tide, and bullish investors were unable to resist. The market plummeted, and the trading floor was flooded with orders. Bullish investors were caught off guard. As a result, the current month fell by seven jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and the distant month fell by one yuan to one yuan five fen. The market opened calmly in the afternoon, and selling pressure eased slightly. However, many floating bullish positions were still being cut. At the close, No. 3 cotton was up more than one yuan in the near month and flat in the distant month. As a result, the near month rose by one jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the distant month was flat.

<p>Tianjin American Cotton at 45.00: Shenxin Factory purchased 100 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory. Lingbao Cotton at 44.00: Shenxin Factory purchased 90 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Loan at Nine-Tenths</h3>
<p>Washington, 22nd: The administration has announced a loan of nine-tenths of a cent for cotton.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Before the Loan Announcement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with firm conditions, with prices for all months rising or falling by one to three points. Trading was sluggish as merchants awaited an announcement about the cotton loan. Subsequently, buying by fellow traders and brokers pushed prices higher, but transactions were few. In addition, rumors from Washington indicated that there might not be an announcement about the loan today, which disappointed merchants. Apart from brokers buying distant months and selling December, there was nothing remarkable to report. The market closed steadily. Spot prices rose five points, while futures rose or fell by one to three points. English spot cotton rose one point, while futures fell three to five points. Indian cotton saw short covering, with short positions being covered, and sellers sold slightly. Plain Gore rose half a rupee, Amritsar rose 0.75 rupees, and Broach rose 0.25 to 2.125 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (Telegram of the 22nd).</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton - Compared to the Previous Day (National Currency). English - Compared to the Previous Day (National Currency). According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Broach cotton for April-May on the 23rd was 206 rupees, the same as the previous day's close. The Cotton Industry Association's forecast price was 196.5 rupees, down 95 rupees.</p>
<h3>Finance - Hong Kong Market Strengthens; Standard Gold Price Drops by 5.2 Yuan; Briefly Rises After Falling; Remains Unstable Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was influenced by the strengthening of the Hong Kong market and the tightening and subsequent easing of the local exchange market. However, mid-session, due to Sassoon's covering of exchange rates, which tightened the market, prices rebounded after falling. The trend continued to fluctuate. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw London rising and the U.S. market remaining flat. After the close of the large-bar market, prices rose due to speculative buying. Forward silver prices in Monte Carlo rose by 1.2 to 5.7 cents. Exchange rates contracted. London raw gold rose half a penny. News of the depreciation of Hong Kong currency had little impact, as this was due to the depreciation of Hong Kong paper against Guangzhou currency, which had little direct relationship with foreign exchange rates. However, differing psychological observations led to considerable uncertainty when the market opened. Pre-market trading opened at 82.3 yuan, having been called at 83.4 yuan, slightly lower than the previous close, but relatively stable compared to the post-market close. Trading was light, with major players on the sidelines and small investors selling heavily. The price fell into the 80-yuan range. Seeing the worsening trend, major players sold slightly, driving the price down to 78 yuan. Hengyu, Dahui Xiang, Richang, Chunyuan, and Yong'erxing bought actively, pulling the price back up to 83-84 yuan. This was because the Central Bank's board was unchanged, with no changes to British, American, or Customs Gold Unit rates, which stimulated buying interest. The standard gold price was 930 yuan. After opening, selling pressure increased, gradually pushing prices lower and falling into the 80-yuan range. Banks took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, and buyers became active, soon pushing the price back above 80 yuan. It was learned that HSBC's rates were flat for the pound and down 0.0625 for the dollar, stabilizing the situation. Later, HSBC and Sassoon successively covered their positions, tightening the domestic market and stimulating buying, causing prices to rise. However, banks sold at higher prices, causing prices to fluctuate again. Later, the exchange market eased due to selling by banks and Qiao Zhifu, and prices repeatedly fell below 80 yuan. However, major players continued to buy at low prices, easily pulling prices back up. It was predicted that Indian silver would shrink by two annas. The market was stable at noon. The afternoon market opened slightly late, with light trading. However, sentiment was not strong and trended downward. The Hong Kong market strengthened, and Indian silver rebounded by two annas, falling back into the 80-yuan range, but it was still easy to pull prices back up, as major players continued to accumulate. Thereafter, banks suddenly sold aggressively, loosening the domestic market. The Hong Kong market remained strong, and selling pressure intensified, causing a sharp decline. Indian silver twice fell back to a small two annas. Buyers became active at low prices, and finally the price rose back above 80 yuan. A record of the day's market situation is presented below.</p>

However, banks maintained prices by buying at low prices. It was learned that HSBC's posted rates were flat for the pound and down 0.0625 for the dollar, and the market was extremely stable at this time. Later, HSBC covered its position, and Sha continued to cover, and the market gradually tightened. However, banks sold at higher prices, causing much fluctuation. Later, the mainland and Qiao Zhifu suddenly sold, causing the process to ease again. It was predicted that Indian silver would shrink by two annas. The market was still flat at noon. The afternoon market opened calmly. However, due to the strengthening of the Hong Kong market, banks gradually became sellers.

<h3>Lending by Qian Zhuang Remains Difficult</h3>
<p>The late autumn heat does not diminish the summer's intensity, affecting the progress of commerce. Silver banks and Qian Zhuang are carefully considering the current market and local liquidity. This is because the number of reputable shops has greatly decreased, and many ordinary shops, in order to adjust their finances, often lose their reputation and credit, making lending particularly difficult. As a result, even now during the Mid-Autumn Festival, goods remain unsold, and a significant number of orders have not been shipped. In the Qian Zhuang market, foreign exchange swap rates remain largely unchanged. Both the morning and afternoon markets are at 1 jiao 7 fen, and the settlement rate remains unchanged. In the morning market, interbank transfers were over 3.5 million yuan, and new transactions were over 300,000 yuan. In the afternoon market, transactions were over 400,000 yuan. Transactions in the Small General Assembly were over 700,000 yuan. Foreign exchange collateral transactions involved redemption of over 400,000 yuan and new loans of over 300,000 yuan. Banknote withdrawals were over 600,000 yuan, circulation of banknotes was over 700,000 yuan, clandestine notes were over 300,000 yuan, customer sources were 200,000 yuan, expenses were 300,000 yuan, Qian Zhuang's receipts for foreign exchange public orders were over 42.2 million yuan, foreign exchange settlement receipts were over 3.4 million yuan, remittances from various sources were over 500,000 yuan, and cash receipts were over 300,000 yuan. Bank receipts included foreign bank receipts for bills of over 3 million yuan, various goods, exchange, tax, and collateral receipts of over 3.1 million yuan, telegraphic transfer receipts of over 500,000 yuan, special transfer receipts of over 900,000 yuan, foreign exchange settlement receipts of over 400,000 yuan, and warehouse entry of 600,000 yuan. Chinese bank receipts for bills were over 2.1 million yuan, various goods, exchange, tax, and collateral receipts were over 3.89 million yuan, special transfer receipts were over 900,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer receipts were not recorded, foreign exchange settlement receipts were over 700,000 yuan, and warehouse exit was 400,000 yuan. Japanese bank receipts for bills were over 2 million yuan, various goods and exchange receipts were over 4.2 million yuan, special transfer receipts were over 300,000 yuan, telegraphic transfer receipts were over 500,000 yuan, foreign exchange settlement receipts were over 10,000 yuan, and warehouse exit was 500,000 yuan. Based on yesterday's market observation, liquidity was slightly tighter in secret compared to the past few days, but the surface remained as relaxed as before.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign silver fell by 1.5 yuan to 833 yuan, with the same price in both the morning and afternoon markets. Completed transactions totaled 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign silver was 735.8 yuan in the morning market and 736 yuan in the afternoon market. As a result, it decreased by 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Completed transactions totaled 165,000 jiao in the morning market and 55,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at 344,000, the same as the previous day, with 41,280 strings of completed transactions, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign silver.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Clandestine Banknotes Have Been Returned</h3>
<p>The banknotes issued by major banks in Shanghai are mostly distributed by smaller banks and Qian Zhuang, with the number of clandestine notes ranging from 200,000-300,000 to 3-5 million (smaller banks or Qian Zhuang that have placed orders have clandestine characters stamped on both the front and back of the banknotes, such as the '健' character stamped on banknotes ordered by the silk industry, the '至' character stamped on those ordered by Zhizhong, the '華' character stamped on those ordered by Guanghua, and the '超圭' characters stamped on those ordered by the Central Trust Company, hence the term 'clandestine notes'). In the past, when the market was booming, the banknotes were dispersed and not concentrated. Even if they were collected daily, they would amount to less than one-tenth of the total. Now, due to the sluggish market and the weak purchasing power of the people, the use of these banknotes has sharply decreased. As a result, the sales of these banknotes have also become scarce, and the number of returned banknotes has increased. Often, half of the millions of banknotes sold in the past are now returned, and at least 20-30% are returned. As a result, those who have placed orders for clandestine banknotes often find it difficult to redeem them with cash. It is not easy to raise large amounts of funds in a short period of time, and at least a dozen of them have been forced to suspend operations.</p>
<h3>Securities - Political Situation Stabilizes; Public Bonds Recover at the End of the Session; However, Most Still Decline Overall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was in the final two days of this month's futures trading. The market showed no signs of significant squeezing, and both bullish and bearish parties slowly rolled over their positions. There were no urgent situations or major fluctuations. Large quantities were traded, and because bullish and bearish parties checked each other, there was very little movement up or down. In the afternoon, the market opened and continued to fall by about 1 jiao. Starting at 22, it gradually strengthened. Positive 6 suddenly rose by 3.5 jiao. Number 4 and Number 16 were actively bought. News at the close of the session was better, and market sentiment recovered, slightly better by about 2 jiao. The market price results mostly showed a decline of 0.05, 0.1 or 0.35, with a total turnover of 15.78 million yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are compared in the following table (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grain - Manufacturers Selling Flour, Merchants Selling Wheat; Standard Prices Trend Downward Step by Step</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw soft conditions in both the morning and afternoon sessions. This was because customer demand had been sluggish for days, while the inventory and production of various factories were gradually increasing. As factories had foreign wheat arriving in Shanghai, they had more than enough to meet the demands of selling. Therefore, one side sought sales in other ports, while the other side sold in the market, with strong intentions to sell. Buyers were watching, and the market trended downward step by step. Furthermore, the additional fee of 0.05 for cash payment, which had been agreed upon, was cancelled on the same day. Customer hoarding was even more restrained. However, due to high raw material costs, it was difficult for prices to fall significantly. The closing prices were down 0.01 for August-September, down 0.0075 for November, and down 0.01 for December-January.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw foreign wheat prices uniformly reported as rising after the morning opening, with American wheat rising by 0.7-0.8 and Canadian wheat rising by a small 0.5-0.6. However, orders were not finalized, and no one made inquiries. Furthermore, spot goods from factories remained unmoved, and a few merchants sold standard wheat in the market. Outside hoarders completely stopped, and market prices trended downward repeatedly. In the afternoon, influenced by the flour market, market sentiment became even softer. Wheat prices were down 0.05 for August, October, November and January, down 0.06 for September, and down 0.04 for December. Spot wheat continued to be rejected by factories, and a portion of merchants had strong intentions to sell. Although there was no formal market, factory wheat was down by another 0.03-0.04.</p>

<h3>New Arrivals Gradually Increase; Old Rice Plummets by 0.3-0.4</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, a total of more than 20 merchants arrived with goods (approximately 4,000 shi in total). The downstream market situation is now experiencing an even steeper decline. This is because the weather is sunny and clear, and new crops are gradually increasing in various places, causing anxiety. Both retail and wholesale markets are sluggish, creating this bleak situation. Therefore, the prices of various thick glutinous rice and thin japonica rice continued to fall by more than 0.3, even reaching 0.4. Du Yang pointed rice and Yinbian Yuan rice also fell by 0.1-0.2. Dongxin rice fell by another 0.02, and Yexie new japonica rice also entered the market, with an opening price of 8.8 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 23-24 merchants arrived with goods from various routes downstream of the river. The market saw weak demand for all goods. The market price for white japonica rice fell by another 0.2, early rice followed and fell by 0.1, and thin japonica rice fell by a small amount. Dongxin japonica rice fell by 0.02, new customer pointed rice fell by a small fraction to 0.1, new tuan pointed rice fell by a small 0.2-0.3, and white yuan rice fell by more than 0.1. The remaining goods also fell by nearly 0.1.</p>
<h3>Crude Oil Suddenly Rises by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, sales of soybean oil and peanut oil have not been strong. Transactions in the market are only listening to prices and there is no formal buying and selling. Yesterday, peanut oil saw a sudden increase of half a yuan because the new and old crops were not connected and sources were scarce. The local inventory was hindered by the usual slow sales in the past, and merchants had gradually sold out their goods. Therefore, under this formal opening, the market price showed a sudden increase of half a yuan. It was estimated that 100 pieces of Bai'er crude oil were priced at 15 yuan, and 200 pieces of Jia Cang crude oil were priced at 14.8 yuan. Soybean oil: 200 pieces of oil from the local factory were opened, 50 pieces of Dalian oil by ship, 300 pieces of Shahe Qishan oil by ship, 50 pieces of Niuzhuang oil by sand boat, and 150 pieces of Niuzhuang oil by ship. Prices were comparable to the previous market and were not significantly different.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Shortage Fuels Price Hikes - Resolution Said to Be Found for Guangdong Sugar Registration -</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a slight softening trend due to a minor easing of customs gold; the guild's quoted price was $17.20 per picul for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar for immediate delivery, with some transactions occurring, down five cents. Re-export goods were quoted at $5.35, but no deals were made. Taikoo Sugar's B Mark sugar saw its price rise by thirty cents due to the shortage of goods in the hands of traders. The company's newly arrived goods were quoted at $18.45 before it would exchange, but no deals were made. Our factory's refined white sugar, Zhenyu No. 1, remained at $16.40, while Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were sold at a discount. Some Guangdong and Chaozhou merchants offered over 200 packages of Hainan red sugar at $10.02, down a small cent, and also 70-80 packages of strange white sugar at $13.65. According to a Shantou dispatch, there is talk of resolving the Chaozhou-Qing registration issue, and later goods may be shipped to Shanghai as usual. Whether this is true remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Sell Well, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have recently seen tight land prices, and merchants are very keen to stock up. Yesterday, over 1,000 packages were offered, including about 450 packages of Mingguang seeds at $8.20-$8.30, over 400 packages of Haozhou seeds at $9, 50 packages of Taixing seeds at $10.60, 100 packages of Huixi seeds at $12.20, and 100 packages of Xu Kui seeds at $11.80, up 12-44 cents. There are still Xu Kui seeds in storage that are being held firm, and the tightness is expected to continue.</p>
<h3>Metals: Revival of Sales to Company Iron Customers</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of more 200-pound Company Iron, the market has seen businesses eager to sell, so the supply increases as the demand decreases. Consequently, the standard has been declining steadily, with the lowest price quoted at only $26 per piece. However, due to the recent shortage of foreign exchange, the total cost has exceeded $27. Although the guild has discussed raising prices, the poor environment has resulted in a lack of major transactions. Since the day before yesterday, customers from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other regions have suddenly begun to buy. It has been found that a total of 600-700 boxes have been sold, greatly improving the market situation, and confidence has returned. Furthermore, factories on this street have also switched to dealing in Company Iron due to the soaring prices of genuine horseshoe tinplate. As a result, there are more inquiries and negotiations than before. According to those familiar with this commodity, the market for 90-pound and 100-pound horseshoe tinplate is currently facing a shortage, and Company Iron, with its lower price, is well-suited for temporary use. It is predicted that the market will have good news in the future.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Life can only show people the way forward; failure is one's own fault.</p>
<p>When our careers are bleak, our finances are tight, and life is very difficult, there are two paths before us. One is tempting us to decadence and negativity, even to taking risks and going astray. But the other path is precisely what allows us to examine the reasons for past failures, gain proper inspiration, and achieve the greatest progress.</p>
<p>Production and consumption are the necessary rights and obligations of people's lives. However, at present, there are often many people who do not engage in production but instead indulge in pleasure and intoxication under the bright lights, indulging in their pink dreams. On the other hand, some people are working hard and struggling to make a meager living.</p>
<p>"Blacksmithing by the furnace in June, old fisherman on the freezing river," this is the best inspiration for our struggle in life, especially for young people who are just entering society. To open up their own future, they should dedicate their whole heart and strength, their entire lives, to society in the most economical and effective way.</p>
<h3>A Study of Red-Turbaned Ah San</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Friends who live in or have visited Shanghai have always seen those black-faced, bearded men with red turbans standing in the middle of the road, either raising their hands or holding batons, directing pedestrians and vehicles with a strange authority. These men come from India and are called Indian constables, but most people call them "Red-Turbaned Ah San."</p>
<p>Analyzing the name "Red-Turbaned Ah San," the words "Red Turban" are quite obvious. However, "Ah San" is difficult to understand. Since the Indian constables hold supreme authority, why aren't they called "Ah Da" or "Ah Er" and instead are relegated to "Third"? This is quite puzzling. Some say that people in Suzhou call monkeys "Ah San," and now they use it to refer to Indian constables, extremely exaggerating their agility and sharp eyes, like monkeys. This is probably not accurate.</p>
<p>One theory is that "Ah San" is a homophone of "O Sir." The foreign people always held the police affairs of the concessions in hand. The Indian constables have low status and small positions, and when reporting to their superiors, they can only say "Yes, Sir," "Yes, Sir." Although this theory seems reasonable, subordinates should use their official titles to show respect, not just say "O Sir, O Sir." Therefore, this theory may also seem to be true but is not.</p>
<p>Another theory is that "Ah San" is a homophone of "I Say," which seems more reasonable. When an Indian constable has something to report, it is natural for the superior to ask, "What do you say?" because they cannot understand. It is also appropriate for the Indian constable to preface the main text with "I Say..." The general public does not understand the meaning of these two words and only hears the Indian constable saying "I Say" all the time, mistakenly thinking that the constable's name is "Ah San." Thus, "Red-Turbaned Ah San" became the nickname of Indian constables.</p>
<p>Of these three theories, I think the latter is correct. I don't know if it is right. (Note: The "Red Turban" has now been changed to a blue and yellow color combination, but the name "Red-Turbaned Ah San" still exists.)</p>
<h3>Swimming Snippets</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Since the start of the swimming season, the Shanghai people's enthusiasm for swimming has increased proportionally with the thermometer. In Shanghai, the most popular swimming pool is undoubtedly the Hongkou Swimming Pool. As someone who has a considerable fondness for swimming, I have been to Hongkou several times this year. Here are some random snippets.</p>
<p>The first time I went swimming in the pool, I found it particularly difficult compared to before. Perhaps it was because I hadn't been swimming at all last year? After resting for a while, I didn't feel so tired the second time I went into the pool.</p>
<p>In the Hongkou Swimming Pool, no one has been responsible for taking care of the clothes and belongings that people take off while swimming. Therefore, things like clothes being stolen and money disappearing often happen. But this year, there is a place to store things. Everyone's clothes and belongings can be handed over to the storage area and exchanged for a copper tag. After swimming, you can take the copper tag to get them back. So, you don't have to wear old clothes when you go to Hongkou to swim.</p>
<p>There are indeed many women in the Hongkou Swimming Pool! But few of them can swim. Although they are wearing 1935-style woolen swimsuits, no one dares to go to the deep end. A friend said to me with emotion, "Women in the swimming pool are just showing off. Few of them can actually swim!" However, he doesn't know that even though most of them can't swim, if they take a photo and publish it in a pictorial tomorrow, with the title of a female swimmer, who will expose the trick?</p>
<p>The first day I went swimming, some foreign people were too annoying. They were chasing each other in the water, shouting, and not following the rules of a public place. Who says foreign people are more civilized than us? I never believe it!</p>
<h3>The Landlord's Misfortune</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<h3>The Inheritance of Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Bin Xi</p>
<p>The combination of a wine-loving and lecherous man and a licentious and mentally deficient woman undoubtedly results in many unhealthy offspring. Indeed, from a physiological point of view, as the saying goes, "Horses give birth to foals, and cows give birth to calves." The physical characteristics of parents and children are certainly very similar. Not only that, but from a psychological point of view, we also know that "wisdom and ability" are also inherited in the same way and have a great impact on future generations. The psychologist Goddard's research on the inheritance of psychological weaknesses is very detailed. He once conducted a very complete study of the Kallikak family tree and presented it to our readers. The story is as follows: During the American Revolution, a young man named Martin Kallikak, from a good family, had an affair with a mentally deficient woman, and they had a child who resembled his mother. Since then, among his 480 descendants, none was not mentally deficient. According to Goddard's statistics, out of 480 people, 143 were confirmed to be mentally deficient, 36 were illegitimate children, 3 were criminals, 3 suffered from epilepsy, 41 had immoral sexual behavior, 24 suffered from alcoholism, and 82 died young. After the revolution, Martin married an ordinary woman, and none of his descendants were mentally deficient, and many were talented or close to geniuses. The two branches of this family lived in the same state and county but did not know that they were related by blood, and one of the descendants of the mentally deficient branch once worked as a servant in the home of the descendants of the second branch.</p>
<p>Readers, after reading this fact, we feel the inheritance of mental deficiency and the resulting evils, poverty, and disease. It is indeed an alarming record. We want to promote "eugenics" to avoid this terrible inheritance of mental deficiency, pay attention to marriage, and limit the reproduction of mentally deficient people. This may not be a method of "improving the human race"!</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Qi Party Clings to High-Ranking Officials, Flattering and Catering to Them; Petty Officials Act with Ferocity, Annoying the Madam with Their Commotion</p>
<p>Qiu Zecheng wore a gray serge jacket and a blue mandarin jacket. His clean face had a hint of a mustache on his upper lip, giving him the appearance of a bureaucrat. When he saw Zhang Jiefu, a look of sorrow immediately spread across his clean face, and his eyebrows were almost furrowed into a line. He said, "Why have you come to Xi'an too?" He only said that one sentence, and he went to talk to the welcoming representatives, leaving Jiefu aside. He was not in a hurry and quietly followed Zecheng, waiting for Zecheng to see off all the representatives. Then, he whispered with a smile, "I have already obtained the help of friends in the banking industry here and can find a position in construction." Zecheng was walking while talking to him. Upon hearing this, he stopped and said, "That's very good." Jiefu shrugged his shoulders and smiled, "It's just that the size of the matter cannot be determined. If I could get a signature from Commissioner Lan, that would be perfect. Look, the slogans on this wall are all made by me. Although they are just a few pieces of paper, they add a lot of prestige to Mr. Lan." Only then did Zecheng notice the slogans on the wall. Seeing that the Zhang Jiefu's name was listed under the slogan, his expression changed. He said in a heavy voice, "You are simply messing around!" As he said these words, he stopped, glaring at him intently. He did not even mention a few words of greeting that should be said when meeting an old friend in a foreign land and left. Jiefu walked to the middle of the through hall, but he could not help but be stunned for a moment. Someone behind him called out, "Mr. Zhang, you are really busy today!" When he looked, it was the person from the banking industry who had said he would help. (298)</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Hair is really the most annoying thing, especially when one gets older, and a single black hair turns gray, it's even more hateful!" The Empress Dowager said to me while carefully examining her own hair in the mirror, "And for people in our position, we can't let them turn gray. It's not that our vanity is acting up, but in fact, we really need to keep our appearance perfect everywhere. For this reason, we have to dye our hair black!"</p>
<p>After she said this, I carefully watched how she dyed her hair black.</p>
<p>In a certain drawer of her dressing table, there were several jars of things that were dark black in color and looked very gelatinous. The Empress Dowager picked up one of the jars at random and waited for the hairdresser to loosen her long hair and carefully comb it gently. Then, she herself picked up a not-so-large brush, dipped some of the black stuff from the jar, and applied it to her hair. This stuff did indeed turn some of the gray hair on her head black, but her scalp was also dyed black along with it. I watched her use all sorts of methods, brushing very carefully, hoping to only dye her hair black and not stain her scalp. It was really very pitiful. But the result was still that it was dyed black together. I saw that she was almost about to get very angry, but she had experienced this inevitable result for over a decade, so she was finally able to endure it and turn this nameless fire into nothing. Since her hair began to turn gray one by one, her scalp has never been white in all these years. It has always been dyed black by the hair cream, with no way to remedy it. (398)</p>
<h3>Total Mobilization of Laughter</h3>
<p>— (Sha Yu)</p>
<p>The Price of Eating Rice: Eating is difficult because it is hard to eat, and people cannot but eat, so laughter breaks out when eating. Several days ago in a small restaurant in Suzhou, a short-clothed man came in. After he sat down, he ordered five or six dishes of fish and meat. The waiters in the restaurant saw that this guest had ordered so many dishes at the start and naturally thought he was a big customer. So, they handed him a towel, poured strong tea, and treated him extraordinarily well. The guest waited for the dishes to come, and he devoured them ravenously, not only eating most of the dishes but also eating three bowls of white rice. The waiters waited for him to finish eating, washed his face, and were about to bring the bill, but the man stood up, patted his belly, and said, "I've eaten well. Come on!" The waiters were confused. But the man said solemnly, "Murder is paid with a life, and eating is paid with money? I ate your rice, so of course I have to pay you the money, but I don't have a penny on me right now. I ate the rice, so I'll use my body as the price of my meal. Come and beat me to let off steam! No matter how you beat me, I will never fight back or shout." The waiters listened, unable to think of a way. They quickly told the boss, who was afraid of causing a death and was also unable to think of a way. So, this person who used his body to pay for his meal was able to eat a delicious meal easily because they could not think of a way.</p>
<p>Fun Facts About Killing Dogs: Suzhou recently had a campaign to kill stray dogs. However, the cruelty of the procedures caused the animal welfare movement to protect dogs. In the first instance of killing, a family dog ​​in a house opposite the Public Security Bureau was beaten to death with an iron rod by the police in the dim morning light because the prior notice had not been received. By the time the dog's owner heard the sound and rushed out, the dog's life was already gone. So, the dog's owner was very sad and specially bought several knives of tin foil, folded them into paper ingots, and burned them at the gate of the Public Security Bureau, shouting and crying, "Ah Huang died unjustly. Please, clear sky, grand master, extend justice!"</p>
<p>The Technique of Suicide: Mr. Wang has been going to the swimming pool every day in his swimming suit. His friend Xiao Chen smiled at him and said, "Old Wang, you are practicing swimming so diligently. Do you want to practice well and compete with the mermaid?" Mr. Wang listened and said sternly, "Young man! You know, it is better to have a skill than to have thousands of gold pieces. In this day and age, suicide is uncertain for everyone. I have learned to swim, and when I commit suicide, I can jump into the river. Even if no one comes to save me, with this swimming skill, I can climb to the shore myself in a dangerous situation and not drown!"</p>
<p>The Effect of Inflating: The children of the Wu family saw that the balloon was inflated with light gas on the gas cylinder, and it swelled into various fat balloons in a flash, and they found it very fun. He was watching with great interest when a balloon exploded with a bang because it was too full of gas. The child was frightened and ran away quickly. One day a fat guest came to his house. The child glanced at the guest's round belly and ran inside, shouting, "This big balloon is too full of gas. If it bursts, the sound will definitely scare people to death!"</p>

<h3>Hum in Small AC/DC Radios</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>Recently, small AC/DC radios have become quite popular, but because of their low cost and few parts, annoying hums often occur. If this kind of hum can be inspected, it is not difficult to find its source and reduce it.</p>
<p>Sources of Hum: This kind of hum is probably due to the following sources:</p>
<p>(1) From the B power supply section, this is because the filter capacitor used is too small, or the audio frequency choke coil is too small, or even a fixed resistor is used instead, so that a part of the AC ripple is not filtered out.</p>
<p>(2) The AC ripple in the speaker field coil affects the voice coil and causes great hum.</p>
<p>(3) Hum caused by picking up stray magnetic or electric lines.</p>
<p>(4) Electrical signals transmitted from the power supply line can also be picked up by other parts and generate hum after AC amplitude modulation in the rectification section.</p>
<p>(5) The magnetic field of the heater current can also be induced into other parts and generate hum.</p>
<p>(6) Hum is generated due to excessive leakage current between the cathode and the heater of the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>Determining the Location of Hum: Before trying to reduce hum, you must first find its source. Use a copper wire to first short-circuit the input of the first radio frequency stage, and then short-circuit its output to test whether the hum is reduced; then use the same method to test each stage from the radio frequency part to the audio frequency part: if the hum is greatly reduced when testing a certain part, it is known that this part is the location where the hum is generated. If the hum is still not reduced after passing to the final vacuum tube, the problem is probably in the power supply section.</p>
<p>Methods to Avoid Hum: After finding the source of the hum, the second step is of course to find a way to reduce it. The commonly used methods are as follows:</p>
<p>If there is enough space, you can try to increase the capacity of the filter capacitor; this method can not only reduce hum, but also increase the voltage stability of the B voltage (Voltage regulation).</p>
<p>Add a bypass capacitor with a capacity of about 0.05 microfarads between the plate and cathode of the rectifier tube.</p>
<p>Connect a bypass capacitor of 0.05 to 0.25 microfarads between the power input lines.</p>
<p>If you are using a 25Z5 rectifier tube, you can try to supply the current to the speaker field coil with one set of plate and cathode, and supply the B voltage with another set, which can also reduce hum. But sometimes, if the two sets of plate and cathode are connected in parallel to supply the excitation current and B current of the speaker at the same time, the hum can be reduced instead.</p>
<p>If the speaker used has a "Hum Reducing Coil", sometimes adjusting it can also reduce hum.</p>
<p>If a certain stage causes hum due to picking up stray magnetic fields or electric fields: adding a filter to its plate circuit or grid circuit or screen grid circuit is quite effective; but sometimes the parts and wiring must be rearranged so that those with AC voltage are not too close to those with signal voltage in order to reduce hum. The so-called filter is composed of a resistor and a capacitor connected together, generally using 10,000 to 250,000 ohms and 0.05 to 0.1 microfarads; the detailed numbers can be determined by trial and error.</p>
<p>If the heaters of the vacuum tubes in each stage are connected in series, the heater of the vacuum tube that is most likely to cause hum should be connected to the side closest to the ground potential. Under normal circumstances, the second detector is the most likely to cause hum in the superheterodyne type, followed by the mixer tube, radio frequency tube, output tube, rectifier tube, and then connected to the step-down resistor. In the radio frequency amplification type, the detector tube should be close to the ground potential, followed by the radio frequency tube, output tube, and then the rectifier tube. The detailed connection method is not fixed, and the best way is to determine it by trial and error.</p>
<p>Replace vacuum tubes with excessive leakage between the heater and cathode with new ones.</p>
<p>The rectifier tubes in this type of radio are very easy to age and should be replaced with new ones for testing.</p>
<p>If a green gas rectifier tube is used, connecting a 4-henry choke coil in series with the plate can reduce hum.</p>
<p>Other parts with broken wires, short circuits, and damage should be repaired, without further elaboration.</p>
<h3>Newest Type of Piezoelectric Crystal Earpiece</h3>
<p>— Ding Xi</p>
<p>A type of earpiece has recently been invented that uses crystals instead of magnets and coils in the old-fashioned earpiece. The main part of its construction is a 5/8-inch square, 0.010-inch thick piezoelectric crystal, connected to a cone, and installed in a top-quality Bakelite case. The form is extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>This earpiece has many advantages; what the old-fashioned earpiece thought was impossible has been achieved. They are listed one by one below:</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary earpieces will distort sounds that are too high or too low in pitch; or they simply cannot be heard. However, this piezoelectric crystal earpiece can transmit sound waves within the frequency range of 60 to 10,000 cycles clearly. Especially the high-frequency part is even more satisfying.</p>
<p>(2) This earpiece has extremely high resistance, about 5000 ohms at 1000 cycles: compared with the ordinary old-fashioned 4000 ohms, it is more than ten times larger: so it is extremely sensitive, and even a very small current can emit a loud sound.</p>
<p>(3) This earpiece is very light in weight, only 6 ounces in total, so users feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>With these advantages, the shortcomings of the old-fashioned earpiece can almost be said to be solved; especially for shortwave radios, it is even more suitable. However, the current selling price is too high, requiring US$12.</p>
<p>The connection method of the piezoelectric crystal earpiece and the radio is slightly different from the usual method. The following pictures show the general idea.</p>
<h3>Problems on Summer Radio (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>4.  Reception Sensitivity</p>
<p>Why can winter be called the "DX Season" and summer not? To understand this, one must understand the state of radio wave propagation: the radio waves emitted from the radio station are broadcast in two directions: one travels along the ground, called the ground wave, which is easily absorbed and attenuated and cannot reach far. One emits towards space, called the sky wave. The sky wave can be reflected by the Heaviside layer and reach the ground again.</p>
<p>The formation of the Heaviside layer is due to:</p>
<p>1.  Radiation emitted by radium and other substances on the earth.</p>
<p>2.  Penetrating radiation from radioactive materials.</p>
<p>3.  Fine electrons scattered down by the sun.</p>
<p>4.  Tight outer rays scattered down by the sun.</p>
<p>As for his occurrence, the reasons for one and two are fewer, and most of them are caused by electrons radiated from the sun colliding with gases in the atmosphere and existing around the earth. The Heaviside layer is also divided into two types due to different properties. The area 100 kilometers from the ground is called the E layer, and 100 kilometers above the E layer is called the F layer.</p>
<p>Radio waves, due to the difference in wavelength, have different transmission states.</p>
<p>For long waves (above 3000 meters), the radio waves travel along the ground and do not enter the Heaviside layer.</p>
<p>Medium waves and short waves (50 meters to 3000 meters) enter the Heaviside layer to a considerable extent and gradually refract back to the sea surface. This type of radio wave decays extremely severely during the day and less at night. Therefore, it is often possible to hear distant broadcasts at night that cannot be heard at all during the day.</p>
<p>For short waves and ultra-short waves (below 50 meters), short waves no longer refract in the E layer. They pass through the E layer and refract in the F layer, reflecting to the ground. However, ultra-short waves do not refract in the F layer either. The radio waves pass through the F layer and leave the earth far away.</p>
<p>In summer, radio waves are greatly reduced in intensity due to strong atmospheric interference. Therefore, it cannot be called the long-distance season like winter. (End)</p>
<h3>Italian Radio Broadcasting</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lian</p>
<p>Broadcasting in Twelve Languages</p>
<p>Italy has seven radio broadcasting stations using twelve languages to broadcast travel and economic news. The seven stations are located in Rome, Milan, Bari, Turin, Florence, Trieste, and Bolzano. The languages used are English, French, German, Hungarian, Spanish, Bulgarian, Esperanto, Albanian, Arabic, Romanian, and Greek. The total broadcasting time of the seven stations each evening is fifty-eight hours and twenty-eight minutes. The Bari station teaches Italians to the people of Greece and Albania in Italian once a week via radio.</p>
<h3>Number of Radio Sets in Europe</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lian</p>
<p>The Total Number in the Continent Is Only Slightly Higher Than in the United States</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Geneva International Broadcasting Union, the number of radio sets in Europe in 1934 increased by 19% compared to 1933. At the end of 1933, the total number of radio sets in Europe was 17,882,665, and in 1934 it was 21,194,792.</p>
<p>In terms of the ratio of radio sets to population, Denmark ranks first in Europe, with an average of 160 radio sets per 1,000 people. The United Kingdom is second, with 147.25 sets per 1,000 people. The remaining countries are: Sweden 118.03 sets; the Netherlands 108.86 sets; Germany 94.22 sets; Iceland 90 sets; Switzerland 87.75 sets; Austria 78 sets, Belgium 73.52 sets; Denmark 63.90 sets; Norway 54.85 sets; Czechoslovakia 47.10 sets; Luxembourg 45.83 sets; France 41.97 sets; Hungary 39.14 sets, Italy 10.08 sets, Spain 8.991 sets, Romania 5.59 sets, Bulgaria 1.48 sets, and the fewest is Greece, with only 0.8 sets per 1,000 people.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the actual number of radio sets, the United Kingdom ranks first, with a total of 6,780,569 sets nationwide. Germany is second, with a total of 6,142,921 sets. France had 1,367,715 sets in 1933 and increased to 1,755,946 sets in 1934.</p>
<p>However, comparing the number of radio sets to the population in countries around the world, the United States has the highest number, with an average of 162.23 radio sets per 1,000 people, even surpassing Denmark. The total number of radio sets in Europe is only slightly higher than in the United States, because the total number of radio sets in the United States alone has reached 20,750,000.</p>
<p>Publishing World</p>
<h3>Where Is the Publishing World Going?</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>If we recognize that the publishing world is not merely ink on white paper, but a reflection of the thoughts and cultural conditions of the time, then we might boldly say that today's Chinese publishing world is not just suffering from "anemia," but is already on its last breath.</p>
<p>The development of the Chinese publishing world "with content" has had several significant stages in the last hundred years: (1) the Kang-Liang Reform Movement, (2) the May Fourth Movement, and (3) the National Revolutionary Movement. The first stage shook the foundation of "feudal absolutism," the second stage sparked the demand for national self-determination, and the third stage, the most important, launched the anti-imperialist struggle for national independence. However, the last stage did not achieve much and has long since faded.</p>
<p>If we consider "bookstores" to be the center of the publishing world, and observe the trends in the publishing world through the changes in "bookstores," then this is even more indicative of the dying state of today's publishing world. Around 1927, more than 40 percent of the bookstores that were active in the publishing world have already ceased to exist. Even those bookstores that have managed to survive until today have "lost their former glory" in nature. Several publishing houses with historical significance in the new book industry, such as New Life Bookstore, have lost the brilliance of the "New Life Monthly" and even the "Society and Education" era; Kaiming Bookstore has lost the progressive spirit of the "New Woman" era; Shenzhou Guoguang Society can no longer find the strength of the "Reading Magazine" era; and Beixin and Modern have lost their role in "promoting the development of new literature and art." In addition, there are several others, such as Huatong and Yuandong, which have no historical contribution to speak of, and today are in a state of stagnation in terms of "publishing," so there is even less to discuss.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that even "ink on white paper" has disappeared from today's publishing world. However, even in terms of the "quantity" of books published, it has decreased. Of the bookstores on Shanghai's Fourth Avenue, known as Culture Street, only a few, such as Commercial Press, are "still" publishing new books. Some still publish new books occasionally, but the number is not as large as before. Others have almost all come to a standstill.</p>
<p>Even considering these newly published books, what role do they play? We can analyze their quality from their "quantity":</p>
<p>(1) Textbooks - Still the most competitive target. As the Ministry of Education recently announced the curriculum standards for all levels of normal schools, all publishing houses perked up and competed fiercely. Companies like Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Zhengzhong, Kaiming, Liming, and Dahua are all actively competing with each other.</p>
<p>(2) Ancient Books - Too many. Large companies with strong capital reprint them, while smaller ones retreat to second place. For example, the Commercial Press's Series Integration and the Kaiming's Twenty-Five Histories are all huge books that "garret writers" have no place to put. Secondly, several companies are competing to print "The Complete Works of Yuan Zhonglang," which are all "national essence" books that do not require royalties.</p>
<p>(3) Old Novels - Old novels are also a type of "ancient book," but in the eyes of gentlemen like Mr. Gu Zhi, they cannot be compared with the "Thirteen Classics." The reprinting of old novels started very early, i.e., so-called punctuated novels; but now they are very popular. In addition to the "20% off" books from companies like Cultural Books, several large publishing houses are also competing to print old novels. "Buy ten copies for four yuan" reprints of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Dream of the Red Chamber have become the recent bestsellers of the World Bookstore. Several old operas and ballads occupy huge pages in the World Library of the Life Bookstore.</p>
<p>(4) Picture Magazines - The quantity is large, and it is a characteristic of the publishing world at this stage. Several magazine companies have been established because of this. The content is for young ladies and gentlemen to sit on the "sofas" and look at strangely interesting spring scenes, healthy beauty, human art, and many things that cannot be without "movie stars" and "dance stars."</p>
<p>In addition, yes, what else is there besides books on "how to grow vegetables," "how to build houses," and "how to keep accounts"? (For example, the Commercial Press's New Books Every Day are all basic technical science books, but they are already outdated.) So, what role do these things play in promoting new ideas and new culture?</p>
<p>Therefore, many critics are shouting loudly, saying that publishing houses should not publish ancient Chinese books, they should publish ancient Western books, they should publish more books on philosophy and science, they should, they should, "the third one is still should." In fact, there are various realities that have created the current situation in the publishing world, which cannot be salvaged by theoretical issues of should or should not.</p>
<p>The most important factor causing this situation in the publishing world, apart from the political environment, is the economic relationship. Economic decline not only reduces purchasing power, but also promotes ideological depression, with no desire to read. Because of this, all the reference books of the publishing houses have become waste paper. Even in Shanghai, the most culturally developed place, not only do most students in schools not read reference books, most professors do not look at reference books, but even the number of books written by general intellectuals and writers exceeds the number they read and see at the same time. In the inland, not to mention in the countryside, but even in the cities, according to the author's recent visits to several commercial ports in the Yangtze River basin, people above the middle class are in a panic. It is rare to spend one yuan to buy a book. Therefore, in places like Jiujiang and Wuhu, even the branches of several large publishing houses such as Commercial Press and Zhonghua only see sales of a few cents and a few dimes in their daily essentials business. What is seen on the market is nothing more than goods with 20% or 30% discounts.</p>
<p>In this situation, how can we not force publishing houses to take the path they are on today? They publish textbooks because they know that as long as there are schools, there will always be some sales. They publish ancient books because they know that at least some libraries and collectors still have some purchasing power. They publish old novels because their readership is the widest, and "the big fish eat the small fish," so at least the business of the old lithographic books and book stalls can be snatched away. The nature of picture magazines is also similar.</p>
<p>However, even standing from the perspective of the publishing houses themselves, today's situation is difficult, but it cannot be maintained for long. For example, in the end, the competition for textbooks will be monopolized by large publishing houses. If the Ministry of Education and the National Compilation and Translation Bureau's plan to compile and print textbooks for all levels is successful, this path will be cut off. Although ancient books have the patronage of some libraries and collectors, this market is extremely narrow, and it can only shrink, not expand. If publishing houses like Huajia take old novels and picture magazines as their main business items, then they are not actually within the scope of the new book industry, not to mention that this path cannot be sustained, because the number of old novels cannot be increased, and it is always just a few books. The result of everyone competing must be mutual destruction.</p>
<p>Where is today's Chinese publishing world going? But in this time of total collapse of the national economy, it is not only the publishing world that has no way to go. All kinds of businesses are in this situation!</p>
<h3>"A General History of Social Struggle"</h3>
<p>— Li Jianfang</p>
<p>By Bi Ya, published by Shenzhou Guoguang Society</p>
<p>——One of My History Reading Notes——</p>
<p>A General History of Social Struggle was written by the German scholar Max Beer. The book is divided into five volumes. The last two volumes were translated from Japanese by Hu Hanmin and published by Minzhi Bookstore. The Shenzhou Guoguang Society's translation was translated by Ye Qifang from the English version published by H.J. Stenning in the United States. According to the translator's statement, the English version was proofread by the original author himself. Therefore, this version should be very reliable.</p>
<p>Ye's translation of the fifth volume has a long preface by Hu Hanmin. From the content of this preface, although it can be seen that today's Hu and yesterday's Hu have different spiritual trends, but in general, the author of the preface still highly praises the book's "content and citations are extremely broad, arrangement is extremely meticulous, narrative is extremely profound." As for Mr. Ye, he not only deeply admires Bi Ya's "breadth of knowledge, rigor of judgment, depth of observation, and richness of reference books," but even discovered the original author's "chapter's fluency and narrative's liveliness."</p>
<p>From the introduction and praise of these two major translators, we can imagine the value of this book even before we read it.</p>
<p>Indeed, this book does have its considerable value. What is this value? This value is expressed in the original author's desire to actively break away from the right-leaning tendency of the Social Democratic Party and turn to revolution after the war, and is expressed in the original work's consistent spirit of materialist warfare. The reason why Hu Hanmin introduced this book on the eve of the Second Revolution was precisely to express Hu's intention at the time to regain the sympathy of young people. The reason why Hu's current preface's thought is different from the previous preface is precisely to explain the contradiction between Hu's psychology before and after.</p>
<p>Although Bi Ya's work, which symbolizes his own spiritual transformation, has a strong revolutionary atmosphere, can it be called a historical masterpiece? No. Bi Ya's transformation is a commendable thing, but his historical literacy is far less than that of the German Mehring and Kautsky. No, Bi Ya's work simply cannot be compared to the latter's group.</p>
<p>Bi Ya's work can only be regarded as a third- or fourth-rate work of the European materialist historical school. It can never be said to be second-rate, let alone first-rate. Overly praising this book is due to Hu's other role at the time, and Mr. Ye can't help but show that he has never seen a historical masterpiece.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the trivial flaws in each volume and each chapter, let's point out the most important shortcomings of this book. This may be more meaningful to readers than blindly praising this book. There are two major flaws, namely, first, no center. Second, no analytical ability based on the class perspective.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the first flaw first. The book is titled "A General History of Social Struggle." As the name suggests, it should take social change movements as its research object. As for the development and struggle of social thought, it is only mentioned in the narrative, and these two items cannot be arranged and narrated equally. Equal narrative inevitably turns this book into a product that is neither fish nor fowl.</p>
<p>Secondly, the so-called social struggle not only includes the struggle of the proletariat in ancient and modern times, but also includes the struggle of the propertied and feudal aristocracy in ancient and modern times. But Bi Ya's book does not fulfill this narrative task. Sometimes, his book seems to be studying the general history of social struggle, and sometimes, it seems to be only studying the special history of socialist struggle. When Bi Ya talked about social struggle in Greece and Rome, he did not mention the republican movement in Greece and Rome at all. When talking about modern social struggle, although he used a special chapter to talk about the French Revolution and the German Revolution, he did not talk about the earlier Netherlands Revolution, the British Revolution, and the unification of Italy. Is it because these events are not worth studying? No, it is because Bi Ya's work often loses its center.</p>
<p>For example, in the second volume of the book, the history of social struggle in the Middle Ages, the author only talked about a set of odds and ends, and did not talk about the characteristics of the society and the country in the Middle Ages at all. The third volume talks about the social struggle at the end of the Middle Ages. According to the pulse of the historical movement, he should first describe the struggle between cities and communes at the end of the Middle Ages, followed by the struggle between apprentices and bosses in the guilds, and then the peasant riots at the end of the Middle Ages. The author should and must allocate his research in this way. However, the author did not do so. After describing several major peasant riots, the author used the important space of the entire volume to narrate the ideas of Utopia.</p>
<p>In short, the lack of a center throughout the book is the first fundamental flaw of this book.</p>
<p>Now we want to talk about the second fundamental flaw of this book, that is, the author has no analytical ability.</p>
<p>In history, different types of ideological movements usually manifest extremely different historical interests. The historical interests represented by Plato's Republic are definitely not equal to the historical interests represented by the Spartacus movement; and the historical interests represented by Fourier, Saint-Simon, and Sismondi's socialism are definitely not equal to the historical interests represented by Marx's socialism. Therefore, when we describe the historical development of socialism, a central task is to analyze the social class characteristics of various socialist ideas. To analyze the different social characteristics of various similar socialisms, we can only start by analyzing the modes of production and social relations of each era.</p>
<p>But when Bi Ya talked about various socialist ideas, he did not do this at all. His narrative is more of an accumulation of vague materials than an analysis. This fundamental flaw is entirely because Bi Ya is not a practical social activist in life, and is due to a kind of formal thinking method in his thinking.</p>
<p>This is the second fundamental flaw of this book, which is caused by formal thinking methods.</p>
<p>Then is the book not worth mentioning? It is not so. Although this book is not a first-rate work of the materialist historical school, it does have its considerable value. And comparing this book to Wells' World History, its value is ten thousand times higher; but the Shenzhou Guoguang Society has priced such an ordinary historical work at 3.5 yuan, which is too focused on making profits and does not consider the purchasing power of the general readers.</p>
<h3>Two Opinions for Mr. Fan</h3>
<p>— Xing'an</p>
<p>I read Mr. Fan Zhongyun's article "Discussing the Union of Intellectuals in China and Japan with Mr. Murobuse Takashin" published in the previous issue of this journal, and I feel that the argument is very appropriate. Mr. Fan very much sympathizes with Mr. Murobuse Takashin's proposition that "intellectuals in China and Japan should unite immediately," and believes that "for the sake of the future of China and Japan and human civilization, at this time, in order for China and Japan to deeply understand each other, the union of intellectuals is very necessary." This view is very correct. However, we feel that there are still two points in Mr. Fan's words that are worth discussing.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Fan said the following about Sino-Japanese relations: "No matter how strong Japan is alone, it is not enough to exclude China. Even if it can, may I ask if the world powers can sit idly by and watch the development of Japanese power? Since the September 18th Incident, China has indeed encountered an unprecedented national crisis, but why is Japan also in a national crisis, a so-called emergency, and shouting the crisis of 1936? From this point alone, it can be seen that the dispute between each other is only making China and Japan suffer." We used to believe this sentence that the world powers cannot sit idly by and watch the development of Japanese power. But now it is not so. Now we have realized that this is a wrong understanding. Because since the loss of the Northeast, we have seen that the world powers that we believe cannot sit idly by and watch the development of Japanese power are actually sitting there watching the development of Japanese power. Isn't this a very obvious fact that is enough to shatter our dreams? As for saying that since the September 18th Incident, China has shouted the call for a national crisis, and Japan has also shouted the call for a national crisis. It should be known that although it is the same call for a national crisis, the situation of China's national crisis and Japan's national crisis are completely different. If we therefore think that China and Japan are suffering from each other, then that is very wrong.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Fan raised a question to the general Japanese intellectuals, saying: "Who is Japan's current enemy, China or a certain other country?" We think that Mr. Fan's question is superfluous. It is not necessary to care about which country Japan's current enemy is. We only know that Japan's treatment of China has never regarded China as an enemy, but has regarded China as a destination for development. To be honest, China is far from worthy of being Japan's enemy today, like the United States or Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Finally, we feel that the union of intellectuals in China and Japan can indeed promote deep understanding between each other. However, the disputes between China and Japan cannot be resolved by this, and must be sought in other methods. The problem is not so simple and easy to calculate.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Xing'an: Your argument is very good. However, I think it is very clear that the destruction of the balance of power in East Asia means that the powers of all countries will not give up from now on. However, because the disputes between each other have not been consistent, they cannot rise up to liquidate. In short, the international situation is constantly changing, and the current situation is definitely not unchangeable. As for the solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, of course, other methods must be sought, but if we do not have our own strength, I am afraid that everything will be empty talk and will not help.</p>
<p>Respectfully replied by your brother, Zhongyun</p>

<p>Modern Medicine Journal</p>
<h3>Inaugural Remarks</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The importance of modern hygiene has been valued by the general public. In the past, because education was not widespread, the people of the country basically lacked research on medical knowledge. Since the May Fourth Movement, national knowledge has gradually opened up, and they have also realized the need for hygiene and medical knowledge. However, apart from the general intellectual class, it cannot be said to be universal and popularized. The people of this journal are in order to meet the needs of the general public and to impart new medical knowledge. With this in mind, we have specially borrowed this corner of this newspaper to fulfill our responsibilities. However, we know that this great work is very difficult to complete, so at the same time, we hope that our comrades in the medical field will not hesitate to give us advice at all times to jointly support this small corner and make it a sound and beneficial publication in society. This is what we most hope for. The position of this journal has been described above, but this journal has just been produced, and the content will of course not be as satisfactory as we would like. In the future, if readers have any opinions and medical discussions, this journal will welcome them with the same enthusiasm, so that we can achieve our goal of serving society and popularizing hygiene and medical knowledge.</p>
<h3>Chronic Gastritis (Chronic Gastritis)</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Chronic gastritis is often found clinically. The reason for this is that this disease is mostly secondary. Especially after secondary to gastric ulcers, gastric cancer, gastric dilatation, or diseases of the heart, lungs, liver, oral cavity, etc. As for self-poisoning, although it exists, it is not common. In addition, there are also idiopathic cases, which are mostly caused by the patient's unhealthy diet. Such as insufficient chewing. Rapid swallowing. Or strong and excessive alcohol and irritating foods. Or even if the teeth are not healthy, it is enough to cause disease.</p>
<p>Various abnormalities and malformations can be seen in pathological anatomy. Such as thickening of the stomach body. Or even shrink to become gastric atrophy.</p>
<p>In the patient's subjective symptoms. There is fullness in the stomach, tenderness and heaviness in the upper abdomen. Especially after taking coarse and hard foods, it is clear. Others such as mushy taste. Lack of appetite or confusion. Thirst and tongue coating. And there are bad breath and acidic belching. Noisy and nauseous. Yawning. Salivation. Vomiting. Sleep is therefore poor. Heavy head. General fatigue. Job aversion. The stomach produces gas due to abnormal fermentation. In addition, due to the irritation of the gastric nerves. Severe headache and dizziness and terror occur. The heart is indirectly affected, resulting in shortness of breath, palpitations, hyperactivity and irregular pulse. Others due to lack of hydrochloric acid and pepsin. Food is often difficult to digest and stagnates in the stomach. Therefore, the stool is mostly constipation and urine volume is reduced.</p>
<p>This syndrome can be divided into six types based on the results of gastric juice examination in clinical practice: (1) simple chronic gastritis (2) mucous chronic gastritis (3) acidic and hyperacidic chronic gastritis (4) hypoacidic chronic gastritis (5) anacidic chronic gastritis (6) atrophic gastritis</p>
<p>It is easier to distinguish it from gastric ulcer in diagnosis. Such as sharp pain that starts a certain time after eating. The existence of tender points and bleeding. Are all unique to gastric ulcer. It is not easy to distinguish it from early gastric cancer. But according to the patient's subjective symptoms. Then conduct a morning meal examination. See how much mucus there is in the stomach. How is the qualitative determination of free hydrochloric acid? How is the digestive power of the acid enzyme? In addition, use X-ray examination to help. It should be easy to diagnose.</p>
<p>There are various aspects of treatment. Such as food, McLerie’s medicine, mineral springs, and drug stomach pain spirit and other treatments. If the patient can follow the doctor's regulations and loyal advice. Should not fall into poor prognosis</p>
<h3>My Experience with Taking Reproduction Prime</h3>
<p>— Contributed by Li Songlin</p>
<p>I was abnormally neurasthenic due to kidney deficiency. The most painful thing was that I lacked energy. I always felt timid in doing things, and I also suffered from tinnitus, dizziness, headache, brain swelling, weakness in the limbs, back pain and other symptoms of deficiency. I was only 24 years old, but I was as old as an old man. The vitality of youth was completely extinguished. I sought treatment from countless Chinese and Western doctors, but it was difficult to see any effect. The depth of the pain is difficult to express. A few months ago, I happened to meet my former classmate and friend Wang Yiwu on the road. We had been separated for many years. Wang Yiwu's demeanor was still the same. Looking back at myself, I felt extremely ashamed. Wang Yiwu also asked in surprise. I immediately told him about my illness. He said that there is a medicine called reproduction prime, which is the only good medicine to treat your disease. Give it a try. At first, I didn't believe it, but I thought that my good friend wouldn't deceive me, so I tried it. After taking it, it really exceeded my expectations. I felt refreshed and my spirits were greatly lifted. After taking it for more than a month, my lifelong pain was completely resolved. It is truly a rare and holy medicine.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Leukorrhea with Liaodailing</h3>
<p>— Female Physician Cheng Zhujun</p>
<p>Whenever I treat women with leukorrhea, Liaodailing invariably becomes an indispensable medication. It not only possesses unique bactericidal properties but also induces beneficial chemical changes within the patient's vagina. Disregarding my limited knowledge, I venture to share my experience. (1) This preparation is cultivated artificially from excellent lactic acid bacteria. When used, it generates lactic acid, transforming the alkaline secretions in the vagina into an acidic environment, thereby maintaining healthy physiology and supporting the propagation of beneficial vaginal bacilli. (2) It eradicates invading pathogens, clears thick secretions, and eliminates irritant pain and eroded symptoms in the vulva. It has remarkably effective results in treating red and white leukorrhea, cervicitis, endometritis, non-gonococcal vaginitis, and excessive post-gonorrhea secretions. Since I have been using this medicine, it has provided me with tremendous assistance in my clinical practice. (Note: Liaodailing is sold at Shanghai Huamei Pharmacy for $2.40 per bottle.)</p>
<h3>The Anguish of Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Manuscript by He Zhongzhen</p>
<p>I am from Fujian, 23 years old, and have resided in Shanghai for eight years. During my youth, while studying at a school in my hometown, I was led astray by delinquent classmates and engaged in masturbation. Later, my father came to Shanghai for business, and I was admitted to a local middle school. This bad habit persisted unabatedly every night. Eventually, my health deteriorated daily, my complexion turned sallow, and my eyesight diminished. Only then did I realize the harm it caused and immediately stopped. However, nocturnal emission ensued. Initially, it occurred two or three times a month, but later it increased to seven or eight times, even more than ten times, often without dreams. Consequently, I suffered from dizziness, mental fatigue, neurasthenia, lethargy, numbness in my limbs, aching back and waist, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, tinnitus, and reduced appetite. Despite several attempts at medical treatment, the results were minimal. I have endured this for five years, and the suffering is unbearable. This spring, I happened to read in the newspaper a letter from a patient who was cured of nocturnal emission by taking Schmidt's Solidifying Essence Pills. I purchased a bottle from Zhengwei Pharmacy and found it to be true. After taking more than ten bottles, the ailment of several years was suddenly cured. It has been four months since the recurrence, so I am recording this to inform those with the same condition.</p>
<h3>Effective Medicine for Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— Cao Zhongheng</p>
<p>Stomach disease is a common ailment. I am one of the sufferers. I have been afflicted with this disease for over ten years, experiencing both flare-ups and remissions, enduring great suffering. When my stomach disease flares up, the pain is so severe that I experience shortness of breath and tears, as if my stomach is being ripped apart and my intestines are being drawn out, causing excruciating pain in my chest and abdomen. Despite repeated medical treatments, a complete cure has been unattainable due to the lack of effective medication. Doctors have felt helpless. My health has been deteriorating daily, and my digestive function has almost completely disappeared. What greater misfortune could there be in life? Last month, when my stomach pain recurred, I rushed to Huamei Pharmacy to purchase Weitongling (Stomach Pain Remedy), priced at two dollars, which I had never taken before. I intended to take it home and try it, but a severe pain suddenly erupted on the way. I immediately took the medication, and within moments, the pain ceased, and my chest felt comfortable. The rapid efficacy was astonishing. After taking several more bottles, I was completely cured. Now, my appetite has greatly increased, my digestion is smooth and unimpeded, and my health has been restored. I am recording this to introduce it.</p>
<h3>The Correct Treatment for Kidney Atrophy</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The patient, Peng Jingsong, 28 years old, from Songjiang, began marital relations at the age of seventeen. At the time, he was young and ignorant, inevitably indulging excessively, thus harming his sexual function. At the age of twenty, he suddenly suffered from nocturnal emission and often experienced insomnia, mental fatigue, weakness in his limbs, poor appetite, palpitations, and tinnitus. At the time, he neither sought correct treatment nor considered his illness to be serious. After several years of neglect, his condition worsened daily, eventually resulting in complete kidney atrophy this spring. He was referred to me by his friend, Mr. Lu. Upon examination, I determined that he was suffering from kidney deficiency. I instructed him to purchase Shengzhisu (Reproductive Essence) from Zhengwei Pharmacy for internal use. After a total of two months, not only had his ailment disappeared, but he was also full of energy and exceptionally healthy.</p>
<h3>Another Nocturnal Emission Patient</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhen</p>
<p>I am a small clerk in a remote rural area, also suffering from nocturnal emission. My nocturnal emission occurred more than twenty times a month, lasting for five years. I also suffered from severe insomnia, and my physical weakness and mental exhaustion had reached an extreme point. However, due to the poor environment and inconvenient transportation, I could not find a good doctor to treat me, even though I was suffering from a life-threatening illness. My fate was truly harsh. I repeatedly saw in the newspapers and publications transported from Shanghai every week accounts of patients who had been cured by taking Schmidt's Solidifying Essence Pills. I deeply envied them, but being thousands of miles away, I could not purchase them. I was deeply distressed. Fortunately, a relative from Shanghai wrote to me, saying that he would be returning to his hometown in a month. I immediately wrote to him, urging him to purchase a dozen Schmidt's Solidifying Essence Pills and bring them back. As expected, he did not disappoint me upon his return. I immediately took them and slept soundly that night, which astonished me. The nocturnal emission stopped, and the insomnia was also cured. Now, after finishing a dozen bottles, my health has been restored, as if I have been reborn.</p>
<h3>Solidifying Essence Pills are Suitable for Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission and insomnia are great enemies of human health. They are often caused by neurasthenia. Over time, they not only lead to mental languor and fatigue but also weaken resistance, making one susceptible to illness. Poor appetite and indigestion result in malnutrition. Such suffering cannot be ignored. Therefore, the medical community has been studying them extensively. However, although many products are available, few are remarkably effective. Since Dr. Schmidt, a German venereologist, invented Schmidt's Solidifying Essence Pills, based on my clinical experience, they have proven to be highly effective. Mild cases can be completely resolved after taking two or three bottles. Even severe cases are invariably cured. Therefore, in my clinical practice, I am happy to introduce them to patients with this condition because they are truly the most effective product and a blessing for those suffering from this ailment.</p>

<p>— Physician Xu Jiwen</p>
<p>Patient Fan Chongyao, 25 years old, from Hubei.

By the age of nineteen, he felt pale and weak, and many illnesses followed. Brain fatigue, cough, forgetfulness, aching back, low spirits, and weak limbs. Cowering when facing situations. He thought that he would never dare to marry in such a condition. However, his parents were eager to have grandchildren and would not allow him to remain single.

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Summer Vacation and Winter Vacation</h3>
<p>— Gong</p>
<p>Every time there is a summer or winter vacation at school, at the start and end of the vacation, I have to worry. Because at the beginning of the school term, I have to scrape together tuition, room and board for my children. And at the end of the term, I have to squeeze them all into the cramped and unsanitary rooms rented from the landlord. So the start and end of school are both a cause for worry.</p>
<p>When I was a child, tuition was very low, and the vacations throughout the year were only for Qingming, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Lunar New Year. The total vacation time was about one month. This kind of "dead studying" and "studying to death" was like forcing a cow to eat grass and was definitely unsuitable.</p>
<p>Now, studying seems too carefree. A large amount of tuition is spent, but there are only six months of schooling in a year. Besides spring break, weekends, sports meets, and commemorative days, there are also long summer and winter vacations. This kind of studying seems too wasteful in terms of time and money.</p>
<p>It is said that studying in the summer and winter is not good for hygiene. A beautiful mind resides in a beautiful body. But is the living in small garret apartments suitable for the hygiene of the classroom? And how many children can review old lessons or study on their own during these long vacations? Aren't they going out to have fun or oversleeping and overeating? Therefore, the long vacations have three drawbacks: (1) School lessons are mostly forgotten, (2) Hanging out with friends leads to gradual degeneration, (3) Cramped living conditions easily lead to illness.</p>
<p>The above three points may not apply to all children, and the wealthy certainly do not live in cramped conditions, but there must be quite a few who experience these situations, I can say for sure. Therefore, this feeling is not just my own private opinion, but the shared sentiment of all parents. But the education systems of various countries in the East and West are mostly like this. China's education system is adopted from the great powers, and it should be unquestionable. Furthermore, this view is old-fashioned and completely contrary to modern thinking. Because even with the current way of studying, there is still the criticism of "studying to death." If we were to intensify the studying even further, wouldn't we be ridiculed by the knowledgeable?</p>
<p>Actually, that's not the case. Some systems work well in other countries, but when adopted in China, they turn sour. There are countless examples of this, and the abolition of the representative system is one of them. China has been reforming for many years, but industry, economy, production, and commerce are all lagging behind. Therefore, for any kind of learning or enterprise in China, we should strive to do a hundred times better than others, a thousand times better, and worry about not being good enough. We should not only learn the form and superficial aspects of foreigners. Otherwise, China and the outside world will never be on the same page.</p>
<h3>Random Notes in Early Autumn</h3>
<p>— Tan Tan</p>
<p>After the cymbal crashing was over, the monks started chanting scriptures loudly again, and the audience naturally turned back to the Taoists at the altar. When the monks were crashing the cymbals, the Taoists knew the audience's psychology, so their performance was not very energetic. It wasn't until the monks finished crashing the cymbals that they started to put in more effort.</p>
<p>The Taoists' first act of comeback was changing clothes: changing clothes involved wearing a garment with layers of different colors, holding a scroll with an official image, and, according to the sounds of various instruments, at a specific moment, with the help of several assistants, suddenly changing the color of both the garment and the scroll. The method was the same as changing the scroll when adding an official in Peking opera. There was nothing particularly strange, but I was most excited to watch this part.</p>
<p>The clothes changing ended around midnight. The older people and very young children had already gone home to sleep. Standing at the altar were mostly older children between thirteen or fourteen and twenty-five or twenty-six years old. At this time, we would hold hands tightly or tap each other lightly, signaling each other to "pay attention, the good show is about to begin." At this time, many food vendors would come out to greet us. Although we wanted to eat something, we wouldn't buy it right away. First, we would look around, memorize the positions of several young men whom we knew were interested in certain girls, and then call the food vendors to bring us something to eat. Naturally, we wouldn't be able to eat peacefully, but would keep a close eye on the people we were watching.</p>
<p>Before we finished eating, a young man suddenly retreated from the crowd. I would then focus on the girl related to the young man who retreated, and also alert my companions. Sure enough, before long, this girl also quietly disappeared like a star at dawn. We would quickly follow, sneaking quietly so that the people walking in front wouldn't hear us. Based on several experiences, we knew that these girls would definitely turn their heads frequently while walking, so we would definitely not follow directly but diagonally.</p>
<p>About half a mile from the altar, a field of sorghum was so dense that it was pitch black. She hesitated outside the sorghum field for a while, then suddenly parted the sorghum and went inside. We almost laughed at that moment. We tried hard to keep our mouths shut and walked closer to the sorghum field even more quietly. But we were still timid at that time. We looked at each other and didn't dare to go in. We had no choice but to squat down, each of us grabbed two clumps of mud, and we threw them silently into the sorghum field.</p>
<p>As a result, four or five people suddenly ran out of the sorghum field, desperately fleeing in all directions. It turned out that there was more than one couple meeting secretly on this lovely night.</p>
<p>At this time, we naturally laughed triumphantly.</p>
<p>Because these courting couples were our neighbors, we could clearly identify them, even on a moonlit night. We remembered them well and went back to the altar to watch the show. The scene at the altar was completely different. There were very few people left. The candle wicks on the altar were too long, and no one was trimming them, so the candlelight was unusually dim. The monks' chanting was also weak, and the Taoists' performance was uninspired. We suddenly felt tired and hurried home to knock on the door to rest and prepare for watching the show the next night.</p>
<p>Rumors spread like an epidemic. On the second night, besides commenting on the Taoists' performance yesterday, there were also discussions about the secret meeting between a certain girl and a certain boy.</p>
<p>I remember, I clearly remember, that I participated in this wild and happy detection from the age of thirteen until I left my hometown at sixteen.</p>
<p>Time flies quickly. This year's July 15th has already passed. Although we can still eat fruits, when will we encounter this kind of happiness again? Even if I go back to the countryside, I can't go back to pursue the old days! (The End)</p>
<h3>Uncle</h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>My aunt wrote that my uncle's athlete's foot has flared up again. It's worse this year than in previous years. There were even two or three days when he couldn't walk.</p>
<p>My uncle's illness has always flared up severely in the summer. This time, it was severe enough for my aunt to mention it in her letter, and even describe the symptoms in detail. Its severity can be imagined.</p>
<p>He is someone I have always admired and resented. I admire him for opening up a path into the world of business from his hereditary farming background with just his own two hands. My grandfather often cited this as a source of pride. At the same time, I resent his old-fashioned, self-superior attitude—constantly telling people how he struggled and strived in a difficult life, how he climbed from the farmer class of "one foot in cow dung and one foot in mud" to the merchant class who live by pens and brains.</p>
<p>One year, because of my father's business failure, our family was temporarily in such dire straits that we couldn't make ends meet. To save on expenses, and also because my father had to leave us to go far away, we lived with my uncle and his family for a while, hoping to have a man around to take care of the household.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of his background in poverty, he had a very strong attachment to money. As a result, he only cared about saving money, neglecting the losses caused by saving money. His nine-year-old son lost his life in such circumstances, and now his sixteen-year-old daughter has dropped out of school at home. Therefore, the embarrassing nickname of miser was secretly added to his name. There were so many busybodies on the streets and in the alleys. They ridiculed and envied those who surpassed them, and despised and mocked those who were inferior to them. Under such circumstances, my uncle, in the so-called "human relations" trap woven from the envy of some people and the contempt of others, received another name to be trampled upon, as if the Pope was crowning monarchs in the Middle Ages. It was like being kicked and not finding it enough, still having to endure cold smiles that hid knives in the dark...</p>
<p>Because he was from the South, and he had wandered to this metropolis that could be considered a Chicago of the East, living there and needing to interact with people who spoke a different language and had different customs for everything in daily life, he was naturally often cheated. Sometimes, even if he knew he had been tricked, he would avoid causing more trouble because of the language barrier and would quietly deepen his suffering into a helpless curse. Like light smoke, it was initially a tightly packed mass, but later it would dissipate in an uncertain time and space. However, the bitter taste that lingered in his heart could never be erased. Often, because of a new stimulus, the old wound would ferment along with it. So, he would grit his teeth, swing his fists, and pound his head:</p>
<p>"Damn it—, if the heavens have eyes, can see how I, Ya Jin, live my life... Alas, even a sick cat has its day. Just watch—"</p>
<p>But there was one thing I couldn't sympathize with him for being looked down upon. Growing up in the beautiful South, when people asked him about the scenery of the South, he would stare blankly, often answering irrelevant things that had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>My male cousin, influenced and tainted by him, accepted his products. He was the most vehement supporter of my female cousin dropping out of school at the age of sixteen. When my uncle first had the idea, his suggestion pierced my uncle's heart like a sharp arrow, building a solid foundation for his father's idea.</p>
<p>Once, my female cousin cried to me:</p>
<p>"What era is this! Look, I still have to obey my father and older brother, and say that everything old is good and everything new is bad. Then why don't they go back to the old era and insist on living in this new world? Those eighteenth-century minds, placed in front of this fast-moving world, if things continue like this, how can I live in that stagnant atmosphere?"</p>
<p>She had studied at school for a few years and actually harbored a vague desire for a new society. However, I was truly bewildered that my cousin, who had received a secondary education, had become so corrupted.</p>
<p>Although my uncle was thrifty with money, he was also addicted to gambling. Every time he came back after losing money, his expression made me suspect that he might commit suicide.</p>
<p>"Damn—, I can't bear to eat a little more, but I've given all that to that dry father for nothing!"</p>
<p>"..............."</p>
<p>In addition, there were many other cursing complaints and pangs of conscience. Once, twice... after many times, I felt bored. I could only let oblivion take these impressions from my mind.</p>
<p>The uncle I knew was such a person.</p>
<p>Later, in my sixteenth year, because of the great flood in Hankou, he brought his family to stay with us for a few months.</p>
<p>This time, the impression I had of him was not as bad as before. Instead, I felt a little pity for him, having toiled all his life and not yet enjoying a peaceful and comfortable old age.</p>
<p>When people get old, the flame of anger has to bow its head in a helpless situation.</p>
<p>—He was once a lion, but because of the desolate circumstances of his old age, he cherished the memories of his past glory and regretted the irretrievability of his precious youth.</p>
<p>I read my aunt's letter three times and felt a kind of sadness, like the twilight of dusk, slowly obscuring my young heart from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>No matter how beautiful a flower, after blooming (showing off its color and fragrance to its heart's content) and then gradually tending to wither, it is inevitably abandoned by those who once loved it.</p>
<p>He is getting older every day, and I think his illness may never be cured.</p>

Knowing that Li was slightly displeased, Han quickly apologized and went inside to get a cloth to wipe up the water on the table. He then continued to chat with Li Shoubai. Just then, Xiaomei, having changed her clothes, came out and walked past the screen door. Seeing Li Shoubai sitting in the hall, she was about to turn around and leave, but Han Leyu had already seen her. He immediately called out to Xiaomei, asking her to first go to the study to clean up and then accompany Li Shoubai to the study to rest. Xiaomei saw that it was getting late and ordered Er Tu to prepare dinner in the kitchen. She then personally took the silver lamp to the study.</p>

<p>Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber Tune" (Part 2)</p>
<p>Seventh month, Golden Phoenix ascends the small building. Lightly frowning, Daiyu's face is sad. Gazing into the distance, where is home? White clouds and red leaves linger. Xiaoxiang Pavilion tears flow secretly. Grieving over spring and complaining about feelings, Ox. Ziyuan's weeping breaks the third watch moon. Going south and coming north, stop and stop. Osmanthus fragrance, eighth month day. Xiangyun comes out of the eastern mountain with the moon. Next door, the sound of a pestle is urgent. The Milky Way is silent, and the jade plate turns. The sky is clean. The dew is cold. Hundred-foot building, people . Watching the autumn parasol in the courtyard gradually falling. I first heard that the wild geese have no cicadas. Ninth month, chrysanthemums by the fence are new. Light makeup condenses into the beauty of jade for the gods. Not competing with begonias for clever smiles. Bamboo fences and thatched huts are content by themselves. Solitary and aloof, few confidants. Dangerously sitting and leisurely studying the Golden Character Sutra. There is also Siqi as a companion. Not receiving a speck of dust. Picking red flowers in the tenth month of Little Spring. Playing the zither with rich charm, unparalleled in the world. Snow and jade faces reflect each other. Together with the plum blossoms, they make a perfect spring. Poetry as companion, brocade as heart. People are on the first floor of Yao Terrace. Amber cups pour rose dew. Nanshan faces the door and turns clearly. The weather is cold in the Zi month, and the wind enters the pine. Xiuyan covers the snow. Beautiful women warm the pavilions and burn venison. The bamboo stove boils and the fire is first red. Competing for verses, the language is skillful. Pouring cups is a pleasure, enjoying the heart and mind. Wen Wanli, the glow of smoke illuminates. Only with plum blossoms is it different. Ugly month, snow presses a branch of flowers. Baochai cleverly tilted her temples. Plum and beauty compete for elegance and plainness. Singing incense and playing with powder in the snow. Green quiet. Jade face . Stagnant people's charming state is really admirable. There are also scattered shadows of Caiyun. Deeply covered in water, shallowly covered in sand. In the leap month, I was bored and drunk under the shadow of flowers. Keeping jade in my heart, spring in all seasons. How many extravagant trousers and fans. Only the sunflowers face the sun. Thousand-day red, evergreen. Xiaochuang cold bamboo becomes a neighbor. The jade box has not yet risen the Wu hook sword. Looking for Taoyuan to avoid Qin.</p>
<p>Cai Yuting's Record of Retribution</p>
<p>Anding (860) 5 PM to 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Pearl Pagoda Chasing the Nephew"</p>
<p>Saying goodbye, Qing Yi is secretly saddened. The returning son is even more desolate. Originally knowing that the world is as thin as autumn clouds. Only because. The mother's life is difficult to violate, arriving at the state of Chu. The girl is. Expecting my body to be chilled to the bone. Autumn wind has no osmanthus fragrance. The ups and downs of the world have been fully tasted. I am like. A solitary swallow going back and forth on the river. Difficult advance and retreat touching the sheep. You see, the pavilions are staggered, wearing the setting sun. He is. Drifting in the cold pond, sadly lost. Fortunately. Chen Lian scattered to Jin Baoyi Hall. Frequently calling Wang Ben to invite Dongjun. Today. Aunt and nephew meet, happy and joyful. Mount Tai's past favor is like the sea. What to say. A thousand gold meals can be repaid. I am. Ao never forgets the three mountains. Why. People's words contain sad intentions. Holding shame, my big nephew returns home specially. Madam, ah. A warm heart in exchange for your cold heart. For no reason, an occasional change in the beauty's hexagram. One. An old servant measures the length of the plan. Saying. Chase back the young master to avoid sadness. Therefore, drive the wind and scold the electricity, riding side by side. But see the desolate cooking smoke and the twilight. A young man seems to be vaguely by the pine pavilion.</p>

<h3>Lianhua's New Initiatives</h3>
<p>Lianhua believes that the script is the soul of the film and is extremely important. Recently, a script review office has been established to extend talent and specialize in:</p>
<p>(1) Providing materials.</p>
<p>(2) Story segmentation.</p>
<p>(3) Helping to complete the script material.</p>
<p>(4) Brainstorming and mutual discussion.</p>
<p>In addition to the original silent large photography studio, Lianhua General Factory has moved the old No. 2 factory iron shed to a total of two large photography studios. Moreover, because it rains every day, the built exterior scenes cannot be filmed, and the scenery is damaged by rain. In the near future, it plans to move the old photography studio of the Xiafei Road branch to the general factory to build exterior scenes exclusively. The original site of the old shed will be used to arrange part of the exterior scenes. As for the new sound photography studio of the branch, it will be completely used for sound films. The film dubbing will be done in the sound studio of the general factory.</p>
<p>Lianhua authorities have recently decided to produce a minimum of 18 films each year, with sound films accounting for two-sixths.</p>
<p>Lianhua established a music and drama troupe to train sound film talents. In terms of sports, in addition to building various ball fields and swimming pools, it also organized a team. Leisure and entertainment include the construction of a club (temporarily at the branch). To facilitate the academic cultivation of colleagues, the library will be further expanded.</p>
<h3>Sun Yu Watches "The Storm"</h3>
<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>That afternoon, Sun Yu, the famous director of Lianhua Company, went to Yihua Company to visit. The famous technical personnel of Yihua, such as Xia Wan Cang, Shi Dongshan, Yuan Congmei, Zhou Ke, Fang Peilin, Qiu Yi , etc., were all previously employed in Lianhua. Mr. Sun Yu met with these old comrades that day, and naturally they were very enthusiastic. Finally, Mr. Sun Yu asked Yuan Qiao to praise the actors, plot, and photography, etc., and believed that the clarity of the sound was more than doubled that of "At the Beginning of Man." After watching "The Storm," Mr. Sun Yu bid farewell and left.</p>
<h3>"Boatman's Daughter" is a Cry for Women's Issues</h3>
<p>Shen Xiling is a young director who is highly regarded in the film industry. His works are full of new content and new techniques. His past works such as "Nostalgia" are good evidence of this. The theme of "Boatman's Daughter" focuses on the cry for women's issues. The whole play tells us that the "Boatman's Daughter" Xu Lai, under the pressure of the environment, the temptation of vanity, and the deception of Sun Min, finally stepped into the abyss of depravity and ran into the human fire pit. It is a work that should be paid attention to by women's activists across the country. It also provides a new opinion on the issue of prostitution.</p>
