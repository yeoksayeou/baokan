<p>— 崔</p>
<p>本市平民生計攸關之典當業以市面疲敝。經營爲難。日前呈准當局。於本月起。試行縮短當期。以十二個月爲滿。藉資維持。實行之初。僅及一部分。然時會所趨。行見全市同業。相繼仿效。是誠足爲平民生計之前途憂也。</p>
<p>本市典當總數。原達六百餘家。去年以營業衰落。相繼收縮。最近統計。不過四百左右。多寡相權。幾去其半。推究其衰落原因。一在通貨之收縮。一在物價之步跌。夫典當業收受質物。首須資金之流通。丁茲通貨緊縮之秋。資金來源日少。平民需要。日以加增。典業予取予求。義無固拒。因是周轉乏術。未遑自保矣。至物價步跌。滿期之貨。尤苦不易脫售。稽典質之意。原爲暫濟眉急。如期納贖。相濟勿失。乃資周轉。顧以社會一般的貧窮之故。質者以物易欵。卽興以典當爲尾閭之念。典當一經受質。卽不殊於貨取。在平昔之時。典業以低値受質百貨。及期求售。可得善價。乃近來市面日疲。百物傾銷。相習成風。食貨所需尚。苦滯積。敝衣舊貨。寗値顧盼加以典質物品。多屬衣着。時流所趨。惟新是尚寄。庫日久。早失其時。雖貶値求沽。絕少問津。典當營業上之困難。可想見矣。</p>
<p>典質以期。無非警惕質者。期在必贖。縮短當期。徒使當而不贖者愈益增多。且典當方面之有此舉。意在將質物提早脫售。用資挹注。然民生凋敝已久。欲圖貨取。必需財力。力能舉敝舊之質物。孰若取之於市肆乎。</p>
<p>此次與當業縮短當期雖非得已顧結果所及匪獨難矯時弊抑且足病民生爲與當業本身困難着想殊當別謀救濟之道近來金融業因得政府方面之救濟已收顯著成效與當業具金融業之雛型對於平民生計關係尤切政府方面亦有予以維護之必要今者本市社會局已根據典當業呈文草擬救濟方案提市政會議討論想必有以副該業之望也</p>

<h3 id="c53">江河災情視察記　本報特派記者賡雅　漢川慘象與岳口天堂 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>從新溝績行六十里、卽抵漢川、下輪登岸、堤垠高厚、水湮全城、此堤巍然獨存、故附近居民、均逃此避災、於舊有鋪店外、新加無數草棚、單人交通、為之不便、驟視表面、幾疑熱鬧市塲、細察內幕、十九皆在生死綫上掙扎之災民也、轉灣繞巷、行至城垣、積水尙沒城高三分之二、久滯不流、色已發綠、蝌蚪蛙蟆蜥蜴之屬、跳躍浮泳自如、城門水甚深、不能通過、若駕小舟、可由西南城决口處出入、地勢較高之街巷、無舟亦架木橋、其形式與安慶九江所見略同、惟此處災情特重、居民不死卽逃、陰森之氣、頗覺濃厚耳、</p>
<p>漢川地勢低窪、襄河橫穿境中、分全縣為南北兩部、均恃堤垸為保障、七月四日、河水漸漲、惟形勢緩和、詎至八日、上游鍾祥之獅子口、京山之多寳灣、縣屬之毛家堤等堤垸、相繼潰决、水頭高至六七尺、昻然奔騰而來、襄河南岸之彭公堤、計大小七十二垸、外防襄水之潰决、內防江水由沌口之倒灌、作用極為重大、不幸濱襄之索子垸、亦崩大口、遂陷全縣於深國、十三日、南屏大売、又被屯口上泛之江水所漫潰、江襄交禍、災勢益增慘烈、</p>
<p>洪水排山倒海、破城而入、適當八日之晚間、城中人民、初則避居棹几、繼則高登樓上、終則折橡去瓦、翻出屋頂、大呼救命、適値天已微曙、縣府招得小舟三十、迅予救援、分送仙女山及堤街上、兩地距離旣近、救護尙易、故城關物質損失雖大、人口尙無被淹而死者、惟鄉間如「田二河等村落、因深居垸內、大水四圍奄至、全村立被淹沒、大小男女、均已付諸洪流、竟無一人倖生、從此人烟斷絕、誠慘劇也、</p>
<p>全縣災情概况、據該縣水災救濟委員會調查、災區所占面積為百分之九十五、被災農田達四十八萬畝以上、農產物損失約一千四百餘萬元、人口淹斃者約五千、災民有三十六萬餘、約占人口總數十分之九、且各處積水、須俟江襄兩水位、再落丈許、始克退放於外、非如他縣水退較速、尙可播種秋糧、故此間民食、不但目前大起恐慌、卽來春亦將成為大問題也、</p>
<p>從漢川上輪、據解犯人赴沔陽之縣役劉某談、「此次水災、堤垸先後潰决、一面固由於洪水之暴漲、欲防範而措手不及、一面實由於堤工局主管人員、向來漠視職責、事先未能防患於未然、臨時又復尅扣搶險工料、故農民頗為情懣、曾謂如得該主管人員某氏、誓必投諸洪流、用以陪死千百無辜淹斃之人民」云云、漢川四鄉在民國十七八年、曾一度淪於洪湖赤區之範園、今之仙女山上、汈洨湖畔、戰跡斑斑、往事尙依稀可尋、農民性直膽大、其來有自、欲得某氏而甘心、良彝無的而放矢、一般溺職官吏、諒能引為當頭棒喝也、</p>
<p>嗣經緊馬口·楊池口·城隍港·蚌湖口·分水嘴·各碼頭踞堤而望、災情均不甚顯、附近有黃公·鶴豐·泰安·白玉·謝家·天池·等六垸、因縣長督同鄉民努力搶險、先保住黃公一垸、其餘五垸、遂得安渡險關、全縣僅此一塊乾凈土、蓋亦人定勝天之鐵證也、再行至脈望嘴、亦一靠河之小鎭、原屬沔陽、近將劃歸漢川、沔陽地味豐腴、農產富庶、惟湖流連綿、易遭水患、故俗有「沙湖沔陽洲、十年九不收、若還收一年、狗也不吃鍋粑粥、」之諺、但今年隣封大水、末由自拔而沔陽災區、僅達十之三四、誠屬意外之徼倖、推其原因、一由於襄河自鍾祥汜濫而下、大溜多在河之北岸、一由於連日大颱南風、水助風威、風助水勢、致襄河北堤、旣先被風濤攻破、而洪水暴風、復不斷向北岸掃蕩而去、結果、襄北災情、較甚於襄南、沔陽縣區、大半又在襄南、故可得到意外之徼倖、</p>
<p>脈望嘴西南行五十五里、到沔陽縣屬第九區之仙桃鎭、該鈸素為軍事必爭之地、商貨吞吐之塲、居民衆多、市面繁華、俗有「小漢口」之稱、「好吃街」之蒸菜、「竹器街」之竹具、可口精美、頗為世人所贊稱、此次大災之後、因係工商會萃之地、各鄉富戶、多來寄居、市面反驟形繁榮、惟時間上之繼績性、恐將與曇花同一命運耳、沔陽第九區之災况、據區公所調查、被淹戶數為六千餘戶、被災人數男為一萬五千餘丁、女為一萬五千餘口、房屋田產、損失不計其數、</p>
<p>漢川街市中之木橋</p>
<p>仙桃上游、歷經多祥河·蔴洋潭·彭市河·橫口·雙河垸·各處、民居類多傾塌不堪、或就高堤、或依綠柳、暫造草屋、勉以棲止、為防災祲再至、且時繫小舟於庭柱、高架木巢於樹上、情狀至堪憫惻、雙河垸决口、寬約三四十丈、深淺二三丈不等、水尙外流不已、無怪其為禍數縣、時逾兼旬也、</p>
<p>迨抵距仙桃一百二十里之岳口、局面又煥然一新、商肆鱗次櫛比、市人絡繹不絕、以較仙桃、殆有過無不及、岳口有一露天戲塲、　前因市面蕭條、絕少買票入座者、男女優伶之伙食、多賴駐軍代為維持、今於水災之後、夜塲忽常告客滿、各業貿易、亦多相隨而有轉機、兼營茶食旅館洗藻業之得月·翠華·兩樓、建築高大、設備較善、尤有罇中酒已空、座上客猶滿之概、甚有富商大賈、呼妓彈唱、在煤燈照耀下、通宵不寐者、其他茶樓與私家、男女聚賭紙牌、或打麻將者、更數觀不鮮、沿河各地賭風之盛、由來固已甚久、惟岳口乃湖北水災最重縣之大鎭、四鄉洪水未退、鎭民竟荒淫如此、喪心病狂、麻木不仁、母乃過甚、</p>
<p>鎭中有縣立岳口完全小學一所、設備尙稱完善、私小二三處、學生亦頗不少、惟對社會敎育、似尙未注意及之、市民因無正式書報之閱讀、大多圍聚街頭書攤、任意購閱、或聽讀目連救母·新女拐男·賈氏扇墳·公公燒火·二姑娘倒貼·等等不倫不類之木刻小書、有害身心及時問、誠非淺鮮、嘗問書賈、「何書暢銷」、據答、「平日各書均有買賣、最近則百本頭銷數特多、每本百六十文、平均每日竟銷至十五六本」、怪而翻閱其內容、乃淸代編本、以供乞丐所唱之蓮花鬧也、</p>
<p>宮民合作救災之沙陽</p>
<p>岳口以上、河水漸淺、輪行恒以竿探河、然尙發生一次之擱淺、襄河漲洛無定、且忽而流南、忽而流北、灣曲度往往大如直角、從岳口至沙陽水程計一百八十里、若按陸行郵程、祗得六十里、舉凡水利家認為最險最忌之水道現象、多可於襄河見之、輪上大副、與一般乘客之閒話、反多認為此乃「神河魔力當然之表現、絕無思用人力、克服自然之議、聞之殊堪浩歎、客有談京山災况者、據稱、「該縣於七月八日上午四時、因鍾鮮三四號堤潰口、大水奪永漋河冲洗而下、水頭高至二丈、致縣屬四五區災情最重、中如斜陽港·觀音閣·永漋河前村·等房產人口、均罹慘劫、無一得免者、」又謂「此次水災、最重如天門·漢川·潛江·京山·等縣、在昔均為赤禍慘烈之區、岳口鎭人烟稠密、工商麕集、近郊萑苻不靖、防範素稱嚴密、但於民國十九二十兩年問、曾為匪共述陷三次、頭次匪共巷戰陣亡者、餘人卽奮奪其尸、反手握其雙腿、如拉人力車然、迅速拖之而去、後兩次人數倍增、逼去富商現銀十數萬元、市中買物及雇船脚、均照市給價、其發號施令者、係賀龍之妹賀英、姿熊英爽、面色黧黑、騎白馬、掛盒砲、女從五六人、到處演講人多見之」云云、舊創未復、新災又來、襄城人民之痛苦、誠非片楮所能罄矣、</p>
<p>張截港距岳口四十五里、村舍離河岸里許、大水時人避高岸、所建草蘆尙新、嗣經澤口·黃家塲·長樂垸·而至多寳灣、各地因河道灣曲、水流迥蕩、上游冲來之草木什物、紛紛然掛於柳枝屋椽間、多寳灣一處、所撈人尸尤不少、時有一男尸蕩漾於堤邊、屈肱縮腿、俯浮如蛙、而臀部及兩上臂特別臃腫及血紅、似無衣蔽、迎輪乍然見之、心中難過萬分、憶來時與許世英氏一行同輪、過武穴憑櫚眺江、許公子公實君嘗謂「報載江浮死尸甚多、但吾等何未發現」、頗有視災必見流尸、始為澈底之神情、記者當時亦聯想到「男尸俯流女殭仰浮」之事實問題、今見流尸慘狀如此、又不禁大轉宏願、默以幸勿再見為禱、大副在旁、殆已察知這番心事、乃顧而笑曰、「這算得甚麼、前數次上行時、水冲下來的男女老少、鷄犬豬羊眞是一路看之不盡、還有冲下來的草房或屋架、上面落着活鷄、振翅「拍拍」作響、水牛能浮水、見堤岸尙欲掙扎以赴之黃牛及犬豕、死而腹脹如鼓、則隨波逐流而去、我輪初遇水頭、傾斜欲覆、乃急拋錨而繫柳、停泊兩畫夜、始克脫險、對彼漂流之人畜、雖心有不忍、但又無法施救」云云、五嶽歸來不看山、勿怪適見流尸、人多手指而歎、大副獨若無所覩也、</p>
<p>迨抵沙陽、忽起風浪、而河灘乾沙、亦飛颺障目、輪正停泊河中、當有十餘小划、蜂擁前來、均相帮於輪舷、而欲兜客波岸、另由岸來一小划、上載水警二人、一警長身帶盒砲、二警士各手短槍、擬登輪檢查、不料將攏相帮之民划、警長起身、一足先登相帮之民划、一足尙有原來之小划、致小划重量、失其均衡、外加風浪之鼓動、小划遂傾斜進水、二警跌落河中、丟槍急攀他划、經衆救起、該警長移怒於輪、乃登輪扭大副而去、後經該三分局局」長湯作新派員調查、詢明眞相、始宣佈無罪、而釋大副、失槍當晚撈獲其一、如此意外風波、旣未淹斃水警、復未罪及無辜、亦云幸矣、</p>
<p>沙陽屬荊門第九區、地勢低窪、年遭水患、人民對於防水工作、頗富經騐、此次雖曾漫溢入鈸、但未釀成大害、七月八九十三天、襄河暴發、居民尙各划小舟、恊助水警、分赴各鄉救人、附近二十里內、僅死十餘人、較遠之處、則淹斃無數、水警打撈尸身、亦頗努力、計沙陽撈起百餘具、舊口二百具、馬良·三官廟·等處共三百餘具、屍具多係中年男女、因彼等搶護財物、遂遭滅頂之禍、至於老年及幼童、反先高縛於樹上、或早送登於屋脊、遂免於難、十一日以後、水卽漸退、救出之人、曾經三四日之駭餓、多已口不能言、沙陽曾籌欵三百餘元、買麪蒸饃分振之、然欵數旣微、為時且暫、杯水車薪、蒙惠者恐不及十之一也、又大水時、豫省南陽縣之門牌、亦被冲來、足見上游災區之廣、</p>
<p>沙陽農產、以花生·芝麻·棉花·雜糧·爲大宗、陸有汽車、水有輪船、交通便利、且設電燈公司、往年貿易、頗為可觀、糧價未災時、米每斗八吊餘（合大洋一元一角、）蠶豆二吊三四、芝麻油每百斤十六元、水災之後、均已見漲、計米每斗十一二吊、蠶豆三吊一二、油則更飛漲至二十八元矣、</p>
<p>各處潰堤、須速修治、以防冬末春初、所謂襄河、特有之「拜年漲、」又修堤切勿再用包工制、以圖省費减料、致堤身不固、遺害無窮、此次七十二垸之潰决、卽正坐其弊、前事不忘後事之師、責任機關、幸勿河漢斯言、</p>

<p>— （片月）</p>
<p>誠實的女子，在靑春時代，要覓一個可靠的丈夫託以終身，以為這樣，伊的未來的長期生活可以早得安定了。狡獪的女子雖是同抱希望伊的長期生活得有安定的心理，却决不肯在伊靑春時代便决定了伊名義上的丈夫。伊寗願多做一點培養與抬高伊自己的芳譽與身份的工作，享受够了靑春時代所有男子們貢獻給一個小姐的物質與精神上的一切，所有社會造就給一位名媛的宏偉的榮譽，最後纔趕在將被時代遺棄之前，選定伊終身生活的歸宿處：嫁一個廣衆求為而慮不得的丈夫。</p>
<p>當世的人往往慨歎着「世風不古」，或者推崇着「古道可風」，多數抱着重古輕今，以古為鑑的心理。可是一考古代的風氣，古人的行為，也總是重利輕情，不行古道者居多數。若使推溯到最古的時代，乃是智識未開，專講武力侵略的世界。可見無論那一代人，全不過是出於「遠來和尚好看經」的成見，偕重「古道」做幌子以衡量當世罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c117">七夕雜感 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>在不少的歲時令節中，要算昨天的七夕，是最含有詩意和情趣的了，也許是牛郎織女這一段神話，結搆得十二分的技巧，情節是多麽的哀感頑艷，自無怪一般富有情感的小兒女，都表着同情，向雙星膜拜乞巧，我們現在無須研究這段神話的意義和價值，但是我們對於它却發生了下列的二種感想：</p>
<p>我們姑且依照那神話的傳說，天孫和牛郎，因為欠了天帝的十萬聘錢，無力償還，天帝便行使債權者的權威！譴罰他倆終歲耕織勞役，使他倆終歲東西兩岸隔絕着，祇能在七夕相會一次，我們就可以知道欠債是長痛苦不過的一件事，無論天上與人間，都會受到債權者的欺凌壓迫！一個人若能勤儉處世，而不負債，那才能獲得眞自由。</p>
<p>至於向雙星乞巧的一回事，實在也是錯誤的！雖然是遊戲舉動，也要求個實際，試想他倆終年遙隔，那想思的味兒，自然不言可喻了，那末何不想個計策，謀個久長共處，何等快樂甜蜜！可是連這一點也辦不到，由此看來，他倆實無巧處可言，人們更向他倆去乞巧，未免太愚拙了。</p>
<h3 id="c118">逃荒人語 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>大門偶然沒有關上，突然進來了一個形似傭媼的婦人。看去伊不過四十多歲。面有菜色。衣衫並不褸襤，穿了一件半舊的夏布衫。一手還提着一個包。</p>
<p>到了庭心裏，她開口低聲說：「奶奶，討口飯吃」。嫂子對她上下瞧了一過，便答說：「相你也不像討飯吃的，怎麽無端闖入門來」？</p>
<p>「逃荒呀」！這三個字輕輕地傳入我的耳朶裏，不由的使我放下報紙，要靜聽那婦人的談話了。</p>
<p>伊說：「去年旱災，勉強逃過：接着今年又是水災，鄉裏人眞沒得命了！一家老小，東西四散；兩個孩兒，也早已賣給人家了。到了杭州，原望找碗飯吃，那知……」</p>
<p>嫂子不等伊說完，卽攙說道：「不要工錢，帮帮人家，不見得沒人要，強如沿門索討」。</p>
<p>「中人行裏人多得緊，已經坐守兩天了。便是飯，還是昨天中午纔下肚的！奶奶，討口飯吃罷，銅子不要。」</p>
<p>嫂子有些不忍，因叫阿二盛了一碗飯給伊，並撮了些鹹菜給伊。那婦人又索了一張舊報，把飯菜包好，謝了一聲，携之而去。</p>
<p>我目送伊去，深深地感到悵惘，因憶明陳子龍小車行云：</p>
<p>「小車斑斑黃塵晚！夫為推，婦為挽。出門何所之？靑靑者榆療吾飢，願得樂土共哺糜。風吹黃蒿，望見牆宇，中有主人當飼汝。叩門無人室無釜，躑躅空巷淚如雨！」</p>

<h3 id="c120">怪國阿比西尼亞 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 郭健</p>
<p>菲洲黑人國阿比西尼亞，自從去年在華爾華爾地方和意屬索馬利蘭的軍隊發生衝突以來，形勢日益嚴重狂熱的備戰，毫不减殺，徒然多增一種國際時事的好資料。向來對於阿此西尼亞不甚關心的人們，也從報章或刊物的介紹，得到相當的認識。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的祖宗，原是猶太人，當昔日猶太人移居若爾坦的時候，其中有一部份，迷失路途，誤至阿比西尼亞高原，而以為到達目的地，就决定為永住的地方。後來，和尼格羅放雜交，種族漸漸繁殖，遂成現在的阿比西尼亞民族。在人種學上研究，或另有一個見解，不過，斷定他們是含有漢米特族或色米特族和尼格羅種的血，是頗正確的。他們不斷把異已的野蠻人征服淘汰，現在，已有四千餘年的建國歷史，國王哈拉熙勒賽，要算第二百六十代的君主。</p>
<p>他們的民族性很強，很不喜歡人家呌一阿比西尼亞」，倒要人稱着「亞西阿比亞」的。因為「阿比西尼亞」，可作「野蠻人的國家」的解釋。這樣看來，他們比較在菲洲的尼格羅，霍尼督等野蠻人，優秀得多。至於能受教育的，除了上流階級以外，其他的一般民衆，不能享有這種權利，所以大部份是文盲。文字約製成二百餘種，字形很是特別，令人很難明白。但是書寫外交文書的時候，並不用英文法文，始終用着本國文字來保持國粹。他們的法律，是根據一千五百年以前的「摩西法典」和「耶穌敎的經典」，編成一類很古格的法典。其實，他們判决一件案，大都憑着法官的常識或經騐的判斷，而用不着什麼麻煩的法律。</p>
<p>軍隊占全人口百分之三十，即約二百萬人，這種武裝羣衆，統統都在酋長統制之下受着指揮，其巾算是精銳而有相當訓練的，總計不出三十萬人。新式的軍器，只能供給三十萬人之用，其餘的，只隨便握着劍，刀，矛，盾棍棒等。所謂新式的武器，全國共有七十萬挺的步槍，三百挺的機關槍，二百門的火砲，十架飛機，和十輛五噸重的戰車。這種軍器，受歐洲各國的供給也有，收買法意殘舊的二，三流貨也很不少，甚而至連子彈奪不入的步槍也常常發現，軍器的性能，毫不講究的。老實說，他們的以槍對槍，以劍對劍的舊式戰術，仍是根深蒂固的保留着。</p>
<p>出陣時，除了男性的軍隊要赴戰綫以外，還有一羣女件（兵士的配偶者）參加的。伊們列隊跟在後面，帶着日常的用品，攀山越嶺，長途跋涉，毫不厭倦。到了戰綫，就在後方露營，觀望着戰况。有的預備做救傷隊，有的擔任子彈糧食的搬運和通訊的聯絡任務。如果不幸自己的丈夫戰死，為妻子的，就自殺以殉節；或同病相憐的女同志們，互以利刃自相殘殺，以表貞烈。世人只知阿人蠻橫強硬，驍男善戰，而殊不知裏面有這種女性的存在。</p>
<p>大多數的阿比西尼亞人，視軍人為無上的名譽職，所以憧憬着的很多，因為這種念頭在腦海裏，無形中使他們在戰塲上，無論如何，雖戰至一卒一彈，也要拚死禦敵的。比方有一個兵士戰死，他們的妻子或從僕就馬上拾起戰死者遺下的武器，向前奮戰，直至戰死方止。如果有不聽軍命，投降敵軍，或潛逃的，就要當作俘虜看待，毫不寬恕，而處以死刑的。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因此我就答道：「這倒是沒有的事！太后，到目前為止，奴才確不曾給人打過。」我的話雖已說出了口　心上却依舊很狐疑，不知道太后得到了我這個答復之　，又將說化麽話。</p>
<p>「事勢這樣強迫着我，使我不得已而降罰於我們的朝廷中的一人，」伊似乎並不注意我的答復，祇須我說出了便算了，接着伊就直說出伊自己的心事來。「像這樣一個立朝已久，而且過去也不無微勞足錄的人，一旦要把他斥辱開去，委實也是一椿令人極感不快的事！然而他旣已幹錯了事，又經澈查不枉，那末就非處罰他不可；要是我們輕輕地放過了他，不給他一些處罰，其結果必至使各省的巡撫，全把這廣東的巡撫做榜樣，一般也貧贓枉法起來，這還成什麽體統？所以依着律法而論，他所受的處罰眞是再也公正不過的了：不過還有一些遺憾，雖然他是應該受罰的，但由我們這些僅能勉守法度的人去處罰他，終覺有些不安！你可聽人說過嗎？做父親的人逢到他的兒子幹錯了什麽事，不得已而要用手掌或棍棒去責打他的時候，他的心上總不免有一種很痛苦的感覺。</p>
<p>什麽感覺呢？這個我倒還不曾聽人說過咧！</p>
<p>「啊！是什麽啊？老佛爺能講給奴才聽聽嗎？」我很誠懇地請求着。（三八二）</p>

<p>志前淡淡的笑着鼻子裏哼了一聲道：將來的事，那有誰能够知道呢？浣花又低頭玩弄那個茶杯子，不能說話。他向志前的臉色看看，才低聲道：程先生一說明了，我也覺得這事是做錯了。不過這也只有我心裏難過，要我想法子來救他，已經是來不及了。我知道，程先生是一顆佛心，决不會對他還想什麽心事，無非是念他可憐。這時候，大概那位賈先生出去了。我可以到他那裏看看去。這倒可以問問他，他覺得心裏痛快呢，還是心裏難受呢？志前道，不必問了。我一個事外之人，何必管那些閑事。剛說完了這句，又作了一種沉吟的樣子，因道：假使你不提起我是去找他談談心呢，那倒也無所不可。浣花就收起了愁苦的樣子，笑道：我當然不能說是程先生要我去的．說着這話，自向賈多才屋子裏走來．可是到了那裏，却見房門緊閉。便是連月英也出去了，正想掉轉身去問茶房，却聽到月英連連的在裏面咳嗽了兩聲。便笑道：賈太太，開門罷，我要進來和你談談。月英將門開着一條縫，向外張望了一下，才放了浣花進去。浣花見屋子並沒有什麽異樣，只是桌子上有兩小件紙摺的玩意。因笑道：我以為你在屋子裏睡覺呢。好端端的坐在屋子裏，關着門幹什麽。（二八二）</p>

<h3 id="c124">女子壘球規則確定　决用女子戶外壘球規則 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>棒球一道、世人目爲美國之國技、而各國亦多採用者、蓋以其運動量頗爲適當、而於訓練個人之思想周密、行動敏捷、團體之互相合作、犧牲私己等德性、尤有甚大之功能也、此種游戲、流入我國雖巳有年、但因設備種種之不經濟、游戲方法之不適宜於一般心理、習之者鮮、更不為大衆所重視、棒球原有戶內戶外之分、我國因各地譯名之不統一、有稱棒球者、有稱壘球者、有稱棍球者、更有沿用名野球者、降至近年、始漸歸統一、而以棒球名男子游戲、壘球名女子游戲、已成習慣、</p>
<p>然考美國關於壘球、猶有數種不同之規則、施用於各種不同之環境中、如戶內壘球規則（IndoorBaseball　Rules體育塲壘球規則（PlaygroundBaseball　Rules）、女子戶外壘球規則（OutdoorBaceball　Rulesfor　Girls　and　Women）等、分別適用於男女室內游戲、體育塲游戲、及專用於女子戶外游戲者是也、查自第五屆全國運動大會列女子壘球為錦標之一種、即以戶內壘球規則為指定之規則、而比賽則行於戶外、試行結果、雖未發現若何不合之處、然終以規則與塲地環境之不適宜、究未能盡其所長、本屆大會有鑒於此頗思有以改進之、遂經籌備委員會常委會議之决定、採用女子戶外壘球規則、良以此項規則、本專為女子而設、又係在戶外比賽、可稱最宜、惟念規則之確定、為期較遲、其設備方面、誠恐各方沿用屆舊規、驟有變更、技能訓練上諸感不慣、故經通告球塲尺寸及球之大小、均仍其舊、游戲方法、則適用新規、好在新舊者、其內容條小有差別、常不致影響於整個戰術也、</p>
<p>此項規則、係一九三五年美國司堡丁運動器具公司出版（Spalding　Athletic　Library　No.t　zfR）現經本會譯成中文、正在趕速印刷、儘早寄送各單位以作準繩、各單位於未收到譯本前、如需參老、希先覓購原文參閱是幸、</p>
<p>抑尤有進者、女子運動、範圍較男子為狹、而壘球一道、不失為適當而和平之游戲運動、設備並不甚貴、大有提倡之價值、故望各單位於是項錦標、踴躍參加、而於平日訓練、尤望多加推行焉、</p>
<h3 id="c125">業餘運動規則 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>

<p>「這些是龐韜摩的便鞋；可是他從外面回到房子裏，從不記到把它們換上；所以他就沒有份了。它們是太大些；那不就是更好呢？因為這麼你就跑不快，逃不掉了。」</p>

<p>「這便很好！現在我要好好把你烘燥，幷且要設法除掉你那種惡嗆。你嗆得多久了，寶？裴夫人問道，她一面搜索她那個針錢大籃子，想尋找一條法蘭絨。</p>
<p>「整個冬天了。我有一次傷了風，以後便總像不能好起來。」</p>
<p>「莫怪，住在那潮濕地窖裏，背上幾乎連一條破布都沒有！」裴夫人以輕微的聲音對她的丈夫道，其時他正以一雙老練的眼睛審視那個童子，特別注意到那瘦削的太陽，乾燥的口唇，以及瘖啞的聲音，和一連種不時的重咳，咳的時候，使那穿着了打補針背心的彎曲的雙肩也不息地震撼。</p>
<p>裴先生和他的夫人對兩對而且互道了電報以後，他就說道，「羅勃，我的小幫手，輕輕跑到納綏那邊去，告訴她給你那一瓶咳嗽藥和藥膏。」</p>
<p>乃德聽到了用藥，臉上顯出有些担心，然而他的恐懽已消失於一次捧腹的大笑中，當裴夫人做着一種令人發噱的臉相對他附耳說道：</p>
<p>「聽我的滑頭坦第硬做咳嗽的模樣。我給你的露漿裏含有蜜汁在內，他也想要一點呢。」</p>

<h3 id="c165">素食 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>有人以為「中國的菜比外國的好吃」，列為中國文化的優點之一。自然，在肉食的一羣，吃慣了山珍海味，吃慣了大魚肥肉，無論西餐，日本料理，他們都覺得吃了不大舒服，那是可想而知的。但是他們不曾吃過樹皮，草根，觀音土之類，也不曾每日只吃粗米小菜，就不曉得同是生在中國，於他們的世界之外，還有另一世界存在，在這另一世界裏，中國的菜不會比外國的好吃，因此他們論到中國文化的優點，就把自己一羣吃的好菜作為優點之一了。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，肉食的人，也每每讚美素食。相傳乾隆皇帝南巡，在常州天寗寺吃到素菜，不覺笑向住持僧道：「蔬食殊可口，勝過鹿脯熊掌萬萬。然而乾隆皇帝並不因此出家，近代名流如伍老博士，提倡索食衛生，蔡孑民先生也倡素食主義。但是他們未必完全屛絕肉食。藉素食換一換胃口，那倒是好的。尤其是一般腸肥腦滿的人，油葷吃膩了，吃點淸淡的素菜，更覺爽口愜意。上海的功德林，覺林，幾個蔬食處，生意還不錯，就靠這一般人支持。但若有人叫他們戒絕肉食，永遠茹素，我想他們未必會聽從。</p>
<p>好幾個月以前，江亢虎博士演講善生十箴，他的素食箴道，「刀俎生靈，充我口腹。人而不仁，野蠻遺俗。矧於衛生，有禍無福。何如茹素，淸潔遠毒！咬得菜根，香味具足。」他說，（葷腥食物，有害無益。並且殺害弱小生命，道德上亦屬殘酷。茹素旣屬衛生，又屬節儉。但專門茹素，亦甚不便，不妨隨時變通，希望在座聽衆痛下决心云云。」江博士的素食論，我並不反對。卽是肉食的人也不妨提倡茹素。何况江博士的意思原是茹素不妨吃肉，可以隨時變通。說是素食衛生，或許有理，因為鄉下老百姓，一年難吃幾回肉，身體倒蠻健康。說是素食節儉，也不盡然，比如上海功德林的蔬食，不見得會比大三元的粵菜，陶樂春的川菜，致美樓的京菜，價錢公道。至於說是素食慈善，佛家戒殺，本意如此。然而我們的所謂大善士大居士之流，乃是有了錢纔行善，纔信佛的。我們沒有積下孽錢，吃齊拜佛，都非急事。倘若果有天堂地獄，我們並希望升入天堂，地獄却未必專為我輩而設。素食不素食，素食是否一椿功德，都不是我們要注意的問題。何况只憑偶然幾次的素食，儘管作孽一世，就想修福來生，我佛有靈，未必照應。</p>
<p>固然我們知道素食求福之說，是隨着佛教來到中國的。六朝人最信佛，信佛素食的人，也未必獲福，梁武帝就是一個好例。這位皇帝為了佞佛的緣故，不但自己刻苦素食，不肯傷生，他曾命令過太醫，不得以生類為藥。並曾禁止織造仙人鳥獸的花紋，以為褻衣裁翦，有乖仁恕。便是祭祀天地宗廟的大典，要用牲畜，他也只用麫製的代替。他還算是虔誠信佛，行善去殺的了，無奈佛菩薩無用，他還是餓死毫城。</p>
<p>大約是因為梁武帝曾經用過麫製的牲畜祭物罷，後來便有人用麫製的豬蹄羊腿，作為素食的珍品。至今蔬食館子所製素菜二還有素鷄，素鴨，素火腿，素肉鬆等名目。記得孟子上說過「孔子曰，始作俑者，其無後乎，為其象人而用之也！」我以為最初創作素肉的人也該無後，因為他模倣葷血之物製造食品，可見食肉之心未忘，還不如爽爽快快的吃肉。禪宗六祖嘴裏吃肉，心裏無肉之說，倒覺得頗有道理。據王讜的唐語林那部書裏說，最初製造素肉的人是唐朝崔安潛。說是「崔侍郎安潛崇奉釋氏，鮮茄葷血。……鎮西川三年，非多蔬食。宴諸司以麫及蒟蒻之類，染作顏色，用象豚肩羊臑膾灸之屬，皆逼眞也。」這位肉食的官僚，為了崇奉釋氏，勉強素食，然而對於肉食，又苦未能忘情，只好用麫粉蘑芋之類製造素肉，虧他想得出來。倘用淫慾打比，素肉算是意淫手淫之類，倒還恰切，只是褻凟了素食兩字，要算一椿罪過了。總而言之，凡是虔誠素食的人，無論他的動機為了戒殺，為了衛生，為了省錢，我都一律看待，並不一定菲薄。雖說我們知道素食的人，不能不吃植物類的食品，不能不飲含有許多微菌的水，不傷生物是做不通，然而能够去泰去甚，不吃肉類，也自然有他的理由，我也不一定反駁。至於借了素食奉佛掩飾肉食的罪惡，或者騙個大善士大居土之名，那就又當別論了。</p>
<h3 id="c166">獅島海濱 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>在新加坡，我每每蹀環於海岸邊上。我愛海。我愛那狂濤洶湧，我也愛那狂暴而雄壯的吼聲。我愛那深藍的色澤，我尤其愛那由風浪所激成的個個的雪白的銀花。</p>
<p>朝晨，當熱帶的驕陽初初露臉的時候，新加坡的海濱是一片的靜寂。海從東方借到了曙光，在那深藍色的海水上閃出了一片片的金蛇。偏東的海唃上是一片深綠的茂林，傍岸白色建築物的屋角上貼上了紅色的綴片。海從朝晨上吹起了凉風，木船響起了欵乃的音調。船夫在靜寂的朝晨間響出了笑語，那有力的赤臂撑起了整個的空間。汽笛劃破了畏空，那尖銳的呌聲驚醒了罪惡的都市的夢。</p>
<p>最留下深刻的印象的是一個濃霧的早晨。我站立在新加坡河出口的尖唃上。看大霧迷住了人間，海在大風中吼起了劇烈的壯調。陽光被霧層所包圍，金綫變成了黯淡。孤獨的寂影像與世隔離，木船的欵乃聲只遙遙聽見。那時的世界眞像沙漠荒島，敏感的靈魂也會沈入玄想的黑暗的深淵。一種幻覺可以聽出是炮火的聲音，海的狂濤也會想做是偉烈的戰鼓。無邊的境界似乎是虛無，大霧也俞像是烟幕障。思潮會起伏得像海潮一般的起伏，一切人間的不平與憤怒會與狂濤一樣激盪。身體像同化於道時的空間和時間，海似乎呑去了我的生命。</p>
<p>在黑夜，新加坡的海濱人影憧憧，碧綠血柔軟的草地上坐滿了異國的流浪者。海潮不住地敲擊着石岸，海中的長堤遠遠地躺下長條的黑影。夜風不住地在身畔吹拂，歐戰紀念碑旁却偶然地會聽釗一聲輕微的哀嘆。我和萩每每坐在石籬上，把足垂下向海面。海風吹去萩的灰色的淚珠，海鼓起靑年人的鮮紅的熱血。每夜每夜，海的浪濤在萩的壯烈的心中敲擊，直把他送上戰塲。海改去了脆弱底人生觀，海也每每使人的熱情沸騰起來。</p>
<p>在月夜，月亮的銀光灑上海面。雪白的浪花在各處的輪船燈光中潑辣地跳躍和舞蹈。海水洗刷去人問的創傷，月光長長地伸着手向人間撫慰。萊佛士旅館的淫蕩的音樂會令人痛恨，船夫的歌聲却會令人愛。海的狂濤消滅了岸上轟轟的車聲，只有小汽船的一綫光影，向前邁進而消逝，會令人注意。</p>
<p>在獅島的海濱，海鼓起了我的幻想力，海堅強了我的意志；海抹殺了朋友們的創傷，海消滅了流浪漢的惡夢。</p>
<p>我愛海。我愛獅島的海濱。</p>
<h3 id="c167">我們那河堤潰决了（上） <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>「我們老百姓，」那逃災到這裏來的一個宣肩膊，闊嘴唇的年靑人坐下沒有多久就開始說他的故事了。「眞是一年必有一度災難啦。」</p>
<p>聽的人默然。夜空點綴着繁星不住的閃灼，天氣是悶熱得使人氣也差點透不過來了，汗水從說故事者的頭上直往下流，那腦袋像剛從水池裏抬起來的一樣，濕淋淋地。大家都赤了膊，只有那癆病鬼穿着件藍大掛蹲伏在街角落裏，吸着馬占山牌的香烟，一聲也不響地把自己隱藏起來。一個被呌作表嫂的婦人毫無羞意地坦露了她那已經不算飽滿的胸脯，喂她第三胎的嬰孩；面把孩子摟緊些，一面心裏盤算着家裏又多了兩張口吃飯了，就有點疼痛，像一條生活的鞭子抽上了她的心那樣。別的一些人却多少懷着好奇心，所以就促着他：「喂，幹麽不說下去？」</p>
<p>那副寬肩脯移動了一下，用着遲鈍的目光望了望茅草屋裏邊的妻子，她正在替表嫂做着廚房的工作。像有什麽積憤塞在他的胸膈似地，雖說他的口才並不怎樣伶俐，却也和盤把他所遭受的苦難告訴人家了。</p>
<p>他說：「去年我們鄉裏呢，是鬧早災。他媽的田地部乾枯得裂開了縫，面朝着靑色的天，沒有風也沒有雨，弄得大家車水不是，不車水也不是。水少田多，常常要跟人家爭鬧，不然你簡直只好等着餓死。我耳朶上的一大塊傷疤，就是那時候跟鄰會老八打架弄傷了的；我記得我用一支扁擔打壞了他的腿……。」說到這裏，他叱了一堆口沫在煤屑地上，又用手揩揩嘴唇。人家其實是想聽聽他那家鄉的水災的故事的，而說話的人却牽引去年說了好一會，然而才回到本題上來。</p>
<p>「今年呢，來了水災哪！」繼續着說，他漸漸興奮起來。「春天裏也一連下過不少雨水，大家都擔心河水要漲；於是鄉裏那個黃太爺就出而修堤：每家要分派修堤費和人工。我們自然知道河堤的緊要，不弄妥當一旦造成水患可不是玩的，所以都很！雖然那數目也有點負不起。過了幾天輪到我要上河堤那邊去做工了，一早就帶了鋤頭上那裏去。那天是烏陰天，黑雲佈滿在天上，沒有一綫陽光，河水隨着風捲起波浪，我站在那邊頭看了一會兒，覺得水眞是可怕的東西。正在那裏發楞的時候，身後有人呌着我：</p>
<p>「喂，躱懶嗎，要命的就—」</p>
<p>我翻過頸來，原來是什麽工程師，黃太爺的女婿站在那裏，兩隻手叉在腰上，口裏還含着一支烟斗。我便跳下去開始用鋤頭把泥送到堤上去。</p>

<p>我獨自低低地哭着，</p>
<p>但並沒有淚，眼前祇是</p>
<p>從生活上掉下來的辛酸。</p>
<p>那些離開我的，飄得遠遠，</p>
<p>讓它跟着日月悠悠地流過。</p>
<p>夢的幻境，還有什麽溫熱呢？</p>
<p>疲倦的眸子已不勝於閃爍，</p>
<p>生之誘又片片地搖落了。</p>
<h3 id="c169">墻外 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>像碰見了魔鬼一樣，三四個月來一直是病着，獨自個在外面混着的人對於醫藥眞是一件重如千斥大石的負担，踟躕在設備完善的醫院的門外好久而終於不得不蹺開來時便只剩有深深的嘆息了。</p>
<p>自家的屋子靠着街，透過朶爛泥裏嵌着碎磚頭的薄牆，可以聽見牆外的一切動靜，醫如像擺小攤的老六公的嗆咳，被一些高門檻裏的孩子們呌為野豬的小菱兒的哭喊，甚至街狗追逐的聲音都可以聽到的。</p>
<p>北平的担販是比那兒都多些似的，吃的用的，各樣挑子像展覽會一般地從早到晚流動在小胡同裏，不必上市跑街，管你能過日子。</p>
<p>靑菜挑子一天要過十幾回，夏天了，綠綠的紫紫的各樣菜蔬舖滿在籃子上，生水滴子在上面淌，吆喝的勁兒此別的季候特別殷動複雜，手裏只有幾個銅板的人也儘可以挑選一不了。</p>
<p>在這時候，當作人們的早點的是燒餅麻花和白麵饅頭，喊得更響朗的是「杏仁茶開鍋……豆腐漿……」一大枚一張的小報也出市了，由那硬撑的嗓子裏拉出一些裂帛似的聲浪，你可以閉眼摹描出那是一個多小多小的孩子。生久了病的人會憎惡這繫複的人事，因此連報紙都小願買，但每次聽得那些小喉嚨叫喊時却總要心動一下。</p>
<p>直到太陽爬到床上時，車輪輾動的聲音也多起來，鄰近的大胡同裏的汽車也有穿過這小胡同的時候，如是是在大雨過後，大皮帶溜過水塘的聲音都是那麼淸晰。偶而地，也還有那沒有被淘汰盡的馬車得得地行過，轉角處，鞭子一抽，蹄聲又紆遲起來。撫着自己的時常在劇跳的心臟，我知道坐在馬車裏的不是碩胖禿頭的老人便是濃裝的少婦，綢絹子墊在拖下的髮髻背後——這些道地的本地人。頭重得不能起來的日子便痛快地躺着，用整副精神去諦聽那些音籟，猜忖，分析，在心頭勾起許多不同的影子，這些影子伴着我，驅走了一點苦痛，半星寂寞……</p>
<p>「肥油鷄……」「燻魚兒……」的吆喝能引起我的嘔吐，窒悶的胸膈是拒絕這些油腥東西的，只有白梨擔子來時還高興扶了門牆去探探。門外停着一些在樹蔭下閒談的女人，止住了嗓子對我這病鬼出神，怕被人笑話這改不了的饞勁，我輕輕地掩上門。</p>
<p>在傍晚，推小車賣布的那涿州佬是一定來二趟的，鼕鼕地搖着手裏那面小鼓，他要在這幾家門前站住够半點鐘，我聽得見對門那幾位梳辮子姑娘的伶俐的爭執：有的說前天的花布下水掉顏色，有的要用自家的尺量布。</p>
<p>星星快出來的時候，可當晚菜的炸丸子炸豆腐又來徘徊了，零食擔子慢慢疏落起來。小胡同似乎只有這幾個鐘頭是寗靜的，人都像倦鳥似的回窠了。</p>
<p>病中，夜晚的精神總是那麽亢奮，在不眠之夜，眼瞪瞪地瞅着窗櫺，時常地，被一個熟悉的瘋人的脚步嚇得心悸起來，那傢伙嘴裏總不斷京戲，靜夜裏，那大踏步的足音似乎蹂住了我的心，給我一天天內的最後一次的擾動。</p>
<h3 id="c170">大學時代（三八） <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>她不在那些跳舞人裏頭，當我從正在跳「華爾茲舞」的人羣中穿過去時候，我就看見她站在一個窗戶旁邊，不勁地痴呆地注視那紛亂的人羣。她面孔蒼白得像頭上那朵白玫瑰一樣。</p>
<p>「您還認得我麽？」我問，當我走到她面前時候。</p>
<p>她突然滿臉通紅起來。「認得，認得！」她輕輕說。</p>
<p>「我們一起跳舞，好麼，娜麗？」</p>
<p>她仲手給我，一面把頭低下去，使我不能看見她的眼睛；但我看見她的白色小牙齒如何深深地咬着嘴唇。</p>
<p>我們便道樣跳舞了。我們祇跳了一兩圈，因為她會明白我並非為跳舞而來的。不久我們就並立在那雙扇大間的大門底下。我不覺向外邊看去；外邊非常黑暗，祇有靠近屋子的櫸樹才給映射出來的燈光照着。但是一陣流動的夜風雨向我們襲來，使人精神一爽；我一面聽見提琴底音樂和跳舞人底步聲，一面還聽見外邊林中樹梢上像夢一般的蕭蕭聲響。</p>
<p>娜麗站在我身邊，沒有說話，眼光垂向地下。——我鼓起了勇氣。「克里斯多夫近來還好麽？」我問。</p>
<p>她全身顫了一下，喃喃地說了幾句，但我沒有聽懂；現在她那蒼白的嘴角現出了兩條暗紅色的斑紋。</p>
<p>「他今晚若到這裏來，」我繼續說，「那麽他會說甚麼話呢？」</p>
<p>我看見她呼吸急促了，下垂的手痙攣地抓住她的衣服。「請你不要說啊！」她輕輕地喊，「不要在這裏說啊，這裏說不得啊！」</p>
<p>「到那裏說好呢？你願意聽我的話麽，娜麗？」</p>
<p>她抬頭看我。「在外面吧，她輕輕說，「我也要出去的；我們再跳一圈就到外面去、——我在側房看見您時候，那時我就要請您同我說幾句話了。」</p>
<p>我們還跳了一次；然後我送她到她的坐位去，就穿過大門走出小柱廊外面來。——遠處有雷聲：當我走下那二個階級來到空地時候，忽然有電光一閃，使我得從樹株中間看下去，看到海水底閃耀。</p>

<h3 id="c171">美國汽車之禍勝戰爭 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>紐約警廳最近張貼告示，喚醒行人注意交通安全，同時更將美國在歐戰中死傷人數與行車肇禍死傷人數，作了一個比較，謂「歐戰時美國派往歐陸之軍隊，作戰十八月，共戰死五〇·三一〇人，受傷一八二·六七四人；而本年五月二十日前十八月，車輛肇禍死者達五一·二〇〇人，受傷者一·三〇四〇〇〇人，可見其傷害尚較戰爭為重」云云。</p>
<p>這一事實，值得我們加以注意。因為它使我們提出一個嚴重的問題來，即科學的發展是造福我們社會呢，或者還是有損于人羣呢？這并不是毫無來由的，記得去年英國英倫協會開會，有人說愛迪生的發明，已使世界增加三十萬萬鎊的富力，但是另外有人則謂這些發明，使世界產生幾百幾千萬的失業者，陷大多數人於貧困，就是同樣性質的事情。</p>
<p>自然，科學的進步對于人們利益的增進，這點的答覆我們是應當肯定的，坐汽車與利用各種電器的發明，任隨如何是比徒步坐小車，同沒有電燈電車電報電話電力機等之時候來得愜意。其所以這些科學的發明反而造成無數人類中的禍害，不在科學本身，而是人類自己，就是說，如英倫協會一部人所云，人類駕御自然雖極進步，然而在我們人類自身卻極糟糕，即如繁華的都市之中，無論「馬路如虎口」卻不得不走，萬一擋了汽車的路，阿三罵你一聲「豬　」，　你幾記耳光，不幸作了輪下冤魂，其代價則不過幾十百元了事。再如各種交通安全設備，盡屬為汽車所有者的「輕快舒適」着想，而汽車對行人生命的威脅則從來也沒有相當的布置，</p>
<p>所以汽車肇禍事件的繁多，表面看來似乎是交通安全的技術問題，而其實則不僅僅在乎技術問題，且與復興戰爭為害人類有同一性質。</p>
<h3 id="c172">夢裏家鄉 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>偶然想起家，腦袋陡然地漲大起來，彷佛喝過了過度的酒量，沈沈重重地搖晃着。</p>
<p>（家呵！家在那兒呢？）</p>
<p>頹然地倒到床上去了，眼前閃着零亂的光影。</p>
<p>自家也不曉得什麽緣故，最近總時時害着懷家病，只要是獨個兒的時候，尤其是在靜謐謐的深夜裏，家就清清楚楚地在腦海裏浮現起來，一直到腦袋有點發燒，沈重，迷朦，以至於失去了知覺沈沈地睡去。然而，在睡鄉裏，我又時時地做着回家的夢。</p>
<p>（家呵，也許在夢裏才能歸得哩！）</p>
<p>沿著北欖坡的一條支流，我坐在一隻小舢板上，給赤裸着上半身，滿口吃着　　的船娘慢慢地蕩着。在舢板裏，我瞧着桃紅的江水，泛著　　的漣漪，微微的，一疊一疊地流逝下去。微波中，不時地飄浮着椰子壳和香蕉幹，浮屍似的載沉載浮地流着。兩岸青葱的椰林，躺在炎熱的陽光下熟睡，一點也沒有氣息，祇有江上往來的梭也似的舢板的咿呀的櫓聲，清脆的潑水聲，和從船娘的朱唇裏哼出來的熟識的南國調子，打破這清晨的靜穆。</p>
<p>（這一切新鮮，美麗，有詩意的景緻，—已經和我闊別多年—此時對於我</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>似乎覺得倍形親切了！）</p>
<p>小舢板轉了一個灣，蕩過滿植着高大的芒菓樹的三角洲，我已望見岸上高高屹立着的棕欄樹的後面的亞答屋，於是，不禁快活起來，心花怒放了，這便是我所思懷的家呵。</p>
<p>（家，家就在眼　了。）</p>
<p>小舢板靠近岸，第一個給我瞧到的是大順叔，他依然和他的兒子守着那艘半新不舊的粟船，但樣子看來似乎不大神氣，臂膊沒有幾年前般的粗大，醬油色的額上的縐痕似乎深刻而且增多，頭髪也一根根的斑白了。這龍鍾的老態，使我想起哥哥的來信：</p>
<p>（學業到一段落之後，還是回來爲是。因爲雙親是眼巴巴地盼望你回來的。……現在，父親已是一個白髪蒼蒼的老年人了。……）</p>
<p>（也許父親的老態，比大順叔還要龍鍾哩。）心像蒙着一層灰塵似的黯淡起來！</p>
<p>「大順叔，好呀！」我走上前去和他招乎。</p>
<p>這招呼分明地使他感到奇突和詫異，他緊縐着眉頭儘管對着我端詳着。</p>
<p>「我就是達雲呀，大順叔，你忘記了嗎？」我有點不耐煩給他端詳，馬上把名字說出來。</p>
<p>「呵，你就是四少，現在真是長大得認不出來了，哈哈，」他快活得像小孩子般的跳將起來。「怎麼這怎久才回來呢？好吧，快點回家去，「座山」時刻都在盼望你呀。……但是，四少，這年頭兒，市情真個冷清，唉！……」臉孔像鉛鍾似的沉下去。</p>
<p>抵家門，門前是冷靜靜的，簡直像深山裏的寺院，就連那隻喜歡在門旁角落裏睏覺的阿花，也都沒有踪跡了。於是，我靜悄悄地閃進去，心裏想：也許這出其不意地歸來，會使慈愛的父母親快樂得流淌了眼淚呵！可是，當我走到客廳上，廳裏却靜寂得沒有一個人影，聽不見父母親的快樂的笑聲，和弟妹們的歌聲，嘻笑聲，而且一切的佈置也都非常的　　，全不像從前一樣，同時，牆壁和屋頂，已有幾處破漏，彷彿要崩塌下來了。</p>
<p>（這那裏是我的家呢！）</p>
<p>終於我又走到屋後的廚房去，那兒也靜寂寂的，廚門半掩着。走進去，一股潮濕的霉氣直衝進鼻子裏，怪難受的，此外，一切的食具，都七零八落地擺置，彷彿走進了刦後的荒村。</p>
<p>（唉，這就是我的家嗎？家破落得像這個樣子嗎？我忍不住哇哇地哭出來了，很傷心地！）</p>
<p>當我夢迴的時候，擦乾了眼眶裏盈盈的眼淚，躺在床上凄然地想着：「家，就是在夢裏也歸不得啊？」整個的心，像沈浸在凄凉的氛氣裏。……</p>
<h3 id="c173">黃昏的郊野 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>悒鬰的，都市底囂雜的氣息充塞着我底腦袋。那炎烈的太陽光照射着疲乏的人們的身子，白色的建築物的頂尖透出來的腥臭的氣息，跟着夏天的風輕輕地飄楊，溜進了人們的鼻子里，怪鬰悶的。</p>
<p>「到郊野外流盪去吧！像一片無根的萍草似的飄流呀！」</p>
<p>於是，戴上了歪歪的草帽兒，穿上了運動鞋，哼着年輕人的悠然的調子，輕快的，企圖在郊野里吸取一種新鮮的空氣，企圖在茸茸的綠草塲上看見黃昏的村子間的孩子們的天真的臉孔。</p>
<p>下午，白色的太陽還張着猙笑的嘴巴似的在天空的西方，廣漠地照着大地上的房屋，樹林，虹口公園的鐵絲綱的欄牆外是白色的，絡繹地有着年輕的男女們帶着沒有悲哀的笑臉兒跑來跑去，夏天唯一的消遣塲所的游泳池里透出的笑聲，水花的衝激和散飛的聲音，帶着愉快的調子，在江灣的郊野路上跟着從南方飄來的風混雜地飄揚。</p>
<p>我們三個沿着土敏土的結實的馬路向着江灣慢慢兒跑去的時候，下午的太陽好像含笑地歡迎着我們一樣。沿路兩邊都是叢林跟透着新鮮的風的蘆葦草。碧綠的水平靜得鏡子似的反映着白色的太陽。沒有囂雜的聲音沒有大都市的繁榮的區域里那麼可怕底氣息。雖然這是炎烈的夏天，我却感不到郊野里的寂寞和難過來的。</p>
<p>慢步到復旦大學的時候，那正是夕陽快要西墜，吐出來一片鮮紅的光彩，美麗而可愛的。那時，我們帶着好奇的心情，帶着陌生人的氣息，在那十八世紀的宮殿式的校舍的周圍散盪着，在平坦的煤屑路的上面眺望這一座蘊藏着濃厚的資本主義的商塲氣息的地方，不禁地想起了時代的沒落的影子，從那蔚藍色的廣漠的傍晚的天空的罩籠底下看到的幽美景緻，從那沒有悲哀的染滿了時代的脂粉的香氣的青年們的臉孔，可以聯想到時代的暗角的散漫與荒凉。——畸形的可怕底氣息緊緊地浸襲了我的腦子與心膛呵。</p>
<p>因爲跑了許多路的緣故，在靠着學校前的一家麵館貪婪地吃了一碟粉，肚子漲了起來，又穿過了小橋，帶着空空的心情，像向寂寞的世界探求人生的路似的慢慢地跑着，眼睛瞪着一幕遼闊的蔚藍色的天空。蔚藍色的天空的確好像要沸滌了飛底悒鬰似地，一種無涯的詩底畫幅，從東到西，從南到北，總是這樣溫柔，好像少女張着一個微羞的臉孔，罩籠着旅人的情懷，——我們慢慢兒沿着清清的小溪，眺望着綠色的平野上，給南風吹動得倒幌着的粟枝和長長的葉片，簡直好像一些天真無邪的少女們在跳躍着的妖媚。</p>
<p>夕陽是更溫矛而可愛的。那時已垂在樹梢下，從平野的廣塲面望過去，只見的是穿上了鮮艷的紅霞的輕紗，那叢密而倒垂的楊樹的針葉片中間透出來一個不圓整的血輸實在又好像美麗的少女在躱軀着一樣的含羞而溫柔。是呀！可愛的夕陽。然而，生活在繁盛的都市區里的人們，得到這樣寶貴的黃昏的野景！尤其是美麗的夕陽，簡直是黃金都比不上的。於是，我們又像小孩子似的高笑，愉快的聲息跟着那密密的汽車從身邊駛過鳴鳴的聲音而飄揚。</p>
<p>音樂的，美的，撩動旅人的心懷的。那可愛的蟬聲像歡迎我們似的，不停地在高唱，波揚的調子打破了郊野的寂寞，把黃昏點綴得好像一幅精靈的詩意的活動的畫圖。</p>
<p>黃金色的水面跟那深藍色的天空已漸漸地變得黑了，夜之神已降臨了，郊野里已漸漸地朦迷了，那都市區里的燈光也在閃灼着了。而我們也亡帶着疲乏的腿兒，迅速地又投進了繁華的不夜的街頭了。——可愛的夏的郊野呵！黃昏帶來了看不透的那許多幽美的影子昵。</p>

<p>— 沈塢</p>
<p>…誰知道，真實的生命之一瞬，果然不值生存底若干整年嗎？</p>
<p>V·柯洛連科。</p>
<p>朋友，當我靜悄悄地離開了你時，你千萬不要追尋我的踪跡，也不要跟誰扯起我們的往事。你只要把這一次最後的別離，當作在浩瀚的大海裏泛起一些輕淡的微波。</p>
<p>也許這微波在一瞬之間就平息了，但，在你底記憶之中，這一瞬是決不會跟我們的別離那樣，悄悄地就泯滅了的。</p>
<p>不論在海邊慢步或山間爬行，我告訴你，在這兒正隱藏着我倆之問的危難的奇蹟。你切勿去玄想，玄想會給你極痛楚的失望和渺茫。假如你喜歡，你不妨在海邊拾起些貝殼，靜靜地帶回你底家裏去。但是，如果你不是在海邊而是在山野間時，你拾着一些落在地坪上的松子吧，你好好地用一個小盒子把它們盛了起來；朋友，你就權作珠寶般對它們非常之珍貴地保藏着！不許些兒的風去吹動它，也不許一些兒的雨水去打濕它，殷勤備至：朋友，你該是多麼地得意啊！</p>
<p>但是，從茲貝殼不復在海邊，松子也不復在山野，它永遠地看不見天，永遠地埋藏在盒子裏頭。然而，正就在這之間，它輕輕地潛伏着無限的非愴了，這悲創的絃音你可以從回憶中，聽得出來麼？</p>
<p>現在，我們是分袂了。我知道，在感情上我們的內心總不免隱藏着一些莫名的感傷。也許你更在感傷中期望着我的歸來，這是你底寂聊中之唯一的撫慰。但當時間像瀑布般流駛過去時，你就曉得這期待漸漸有點兒空虛，要不然，那定是用玄想去補償你底失望。然而玄想的結果也是一樣空虛的。</p>
<p>我想你最好還是當它是生命的海裏底一些微波，把強烈的記憶慢慢地消磨了去，你當是不曾經過的生命之一瞬吧。……</p>
<p>够了，從茲風雨再也不會侵　盒子裏的松子和貝殼，皮鞭跟血盆似的巨口，再也不能鞭捷，吸吮我們的血汁了。——讓我們的青春消逝了時，或者讓陳舊的圯塔崩坍了時，朋友，我們再從死灰之中，燃起一點舊日的熱情，回想我們底真實的生命之一瞬吧！</p>
<p>如今，我悄悄地離開了你，朋友啊，你千萬不要追尋我的行踪，也不要跟誰扯起了我們的往事。——靜候着時日曷喪，我們以一瞬的生命抵償了若干整年。</p>

<p>開篇「誡爲人」</p>
<p>紅塵自浪兩茫茫。忍耐和氣是妙方。弗幹壞事度歲月。安分守巳過時光，休將自己心田昧。莫把他人過失揚。謹慎修身心正直。耐煩做事好商量。常觀硬弩絃先斷。每見剛刀口易傷。惹禍皆爲閒口舌。招災多因熱心腸。是非不必爭你我。彼此何須論短長。世界本來稱缺陷。人生那得不無常。吃些虧處原無害。讓人幾分有何妨。春天纔看楊柳綠。秋來又見菊花黃。榮華總是三更夢。富貴如同九月霜。疾病身亡誰替得。甜酸苦辣自承當。那怕爲人工計巧。難瞞舉頭有上蒼。自古道，詔曲工媚共鄙惡。莫不如，舉止行爲要大方，須知曉，應爲香重身遭厄。暨因絲多命泡亡。倘爲人，恃財多勢利。恐被，財多身弱病魔降。還是，廣佈仁義行方便。濟困扶危學孟嘗。延年益壽樂永康。</p>

<p>— 伊東忠太（著）張廣正（譯）</p>
<p>宗敎建築的意義</p>
<p>現在若將人類解作靈與肉的綜合，而將此解釋放到建築上面，到亦可認建築有靈的建築與肉的建築二種。宗敎建築是前者，非宗敎建築則屬於後者。</p>
<p>即是說，前者若謂之為精神的，則後者可以說是物質的；前者說是信仰的，後者可以說是實用的，兩者間固有此劃然的區別。</p>
<p>要之，宗敎建築的對象，是超人間的神佛。非宗敎建築的對象，則是人類。靈是永久不滅的，靈的生活是永久不變的。然，人生則有如朝露，肉的生活是時時刻刻如走馬燈般在那裏轉變。故靈的建築是需要有永久性的，有給與一種靈的印象的風格的必要。肉的建築則無須乎永久性，只求其風貌與建築的物的要求相調和便已滿足了。</p>
<p>神廟建築的理想</p>
<p>日本最普通的神廟，是奉祀皇祖皇宗的神廟。位於神廟以上的伊勢兩宮，是例外來得偉大。至於其他官欵國欵的各神廟及以下各階級的神廟，無非是遵照奉祀永久不滅的神靈的意義。故其神殿，老是保守古式，從不隨意改竄。</p>
<p>然，世人不察此理，至有以爲神殿爲永外保存計，很可以用鋼骨，鐵條，水門汀等堅牢地建築起來的論調，這是謬誤的。蓋理想的神廟，不能不依照自有祭神時的建築形式。所謂「祭神如神在」，可知神廟是神靈的宮室。而水門汀建築的宮室，恐不能盡如神意。甚且有些一定須依照木造草茸的古式，這不能不說是武斷的祗見建築的肉而忘記建築的靈的說法。</p>
<p>最近來日的德國建築大家波爾羅社頓氏，當其首先參拜伊勢神宮時，亦激昂興奮，對其建築的純潔無垢，崇高淸凈，大加讚賞。曾這樣說：「這非僅是日本建築的靈，而實是世界建築的靈」。外人尙且如斯，吾人豈可不加深察？</p>
<p>大概世人往往以為神廟建築亦應順應時勢，以新的優喪材料，施以現代的新新意匠，這是將神廟與家屋，官衙等建築同等視之。關於這些，不再細說，就此告一段落。</p>
<p>破例的神廟建築</p>
<p>晚近以耐火耐震為目的而用水門汀建造的破例樣式的神廟，漸被實現。這是有其不得已的理由與苦衷在。例如大都市的中心區域，有不准木造建築的法規。在如此區域內的神廟，不得已只好用水門汀建造。連帶亦祗好無可奈何對樣式加以改竄，這是頗可惜的事。四週的建築物，悉為水門汀建造，而因此，介在其間的神廟，亦必須以水門汀建造，這本來是說不過去。</p>
<p>蓋四圍的建築物旣悉皆為耐火的，則介在其間的神廟，卽不幸遭逢火災危險，但其鄰近的建築物，絕不會受波及與威脅。况且若在無數枯燥無味的水門汀建築聳立，滯重空氣壓人中，有一座為濃茂幽遝的樹林所圍繞而構造淸凈古雅的神廟坐鎭其間，則正如萬綠叢中一點紅，是多麼愉快的事。人立廟宇前，為俗念污濁的心一時為之洗凈。廻思往昔，追懷古代，未有不悠然而生敬畏之心。故予意以為在大都市水門汀固封中，神廟更須以木造為佳。何况在山間為蒼鬱樹林所擁抱的神廟，若亦要求以水門汀建造，那更沒有道理了。用水門汀建造的的神殿，直簡成為神的堆棧。</p>
<p>有些建築家們，頗以神廟的建築自古以來千遍一律為未足，苦思別拓新面目。又，往往實際從事於破例方式嘗試的，亦大有人在。這是錯誤的想頭。建築家揮運獨創的手腕，其分野是祗可自由運用於別一方面。</p>

<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>（十六）</p>
<p>—關於築塲裏用—</p>
<p>門子板—建造房屋遇到有水門汀柱子（Cment　Clumn）的地方。當然除了紮鐵（詳前）之外。那就是撑壳子板了。對於這種壳子板。普通終是用二寸十二寸洋松料。可是這是一種整塊的材料。僅僅在水門汀柱子的兩邊。但另外兩邊。就用門子板把柱子本身封固。不過這種板料。指的是普通用的福建松或毛板之類的局頭。（詳前）這些局頭一到築塲裏就叫它門子板了。</p>
<p>毛板—毛板（Rough　Plank）就是一寸六寸洋松板的簡稱。這種毛板在築塲裏的用塲。大都是把它做搗水門汀樓板用的一種底板。有時候也把它當做屋面板。但用於屋面板時。切忌有灣曲的弊病發生。</p>
<p>搭頭—立樘子時。墻身是難以倚靠的。必定將樘子用二寸四寸洋松長料兩頭釘牢。這就叫搭頭。</p>
<p>揷鐵—紮鐵在第一步基礎上。（卽底脚大料。或墩子等）。是照樣在底脚裏工作。假使遇到有柱子的地方。最好連根紮起。在工作上也可以省却一番手續。可是有時候。因為「生活」上的犯界。（詳前）祇得將來再紮。那末。勢必事前預先師好柱子鐵的二尺長的局頭。對於這種局頭就叫做揷鐵。</p>
<p>斗—搗水門汀對淤水門汀黃沙石子三者的混合法。在築塲裏是有一定規則的。搗底脚和滿堂。差不多用一三六合。搗大料柱子樓板等就是一二四合。一三六的意思。就是一份水泥。三份黃沙。六份石子。一二四類推。不過對於這種一三六或一二四的質量方面。在築塲裏也有一定的規則。因為一份的質量是一尺高一尺闊的相合。則一份就是一立方尺。三份就是三立方尺。六份就是六立方尺。但對於尺寸的多寡。决不可隨便小工用媒鏟亂鏟。那就用一種做好的斗把它的質量一量。普通斗的做法有兩種。一種是一立方尺的。一種是二立方尺的。（就是高一尺闊一尺長二尺。）</p>
<p>滿堂—底層的地面做煤屑或水門汀就叫滿堂。（按水門汀三字就是水泥混凝土的簡稱）。</p>
<p>對拔榫—一塊一寸六七分厚四五寸長的木塊。在角與角用直綫對鋸。就成為長三角形。用以撑頭底下使之擠緊的設備就叫對拔榫。</p>
<p>拷子—石子在築塲裏假使是建造五六層高樓大廈。那末它和水泥黃沙同樣是認為重要的。石子的出產地很多。築塲裏用松江貨的比較普遍。可是另外有一種用人工拷出來的石子。差不多太湖那邊居多。這種拷出來的石子。比不上用機器軋的松江貨。同時因為手拷的緣故。對於石子的本身。也比松江貨用機器軋的不平勻。但對於這種人工拷出來的石子。就名之拷子。</p>
<p>勢道—築塲裏做的工作。大都依照樣子。但有時候應該做的工作和樣子的尺寸不符。在工程的設施上發生犯界（詳前）的事情。不過旣然碰到犯界。必須來個解救方法。這解救方法。又免不得看工打樣作頭東家四方面互相討論。在築塲裏叫犯勢道。至於勢道云者。就是研究研究的意思。（待續）</p>

<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>——世界建築史蹟上最光榮的一頁——</p>
<p>（D）桎頭　「柱頭」Order之對於希臘神廟有莫大密切之關係。每一時期的代表作，其不同之點，就因柱頭之關係。而一個神廟之組織，柱頭為其重要原素之一，並且神廟名稱，亦每因柱頭而不同，大多數係依柱頭數或形式而轉異的呢！由此，可知柱頭之與神廟，是有何等重大的關係呢！當時最重要之柱頭有三卽：</p>
<p>一，Doric　Order多立克柱頭</p>
<p>二，Ionic　Order愛阿尼亞柱頭</p>
<p>三，Cornithien　Order可林新柱頭</p>
<p>以上三種神廟建築採用最多者則為DoricOrder，故此柱頭之歷史及年代之老古，可想而知了。至柱頭之詳細情形，則留待下節專門討論之，因牠在神廟上講，是佔有極重要的地位啊！</p>
<p>（E）階石踏步　希臘神廟之踏步，普通為三步，但亦有二步的。至派生登神廟Parthenon之踏步，則很特別；此廟之踏步有三級，高一呎八吋，寬二呎四吋，因其踏步之高大，不易走上；因此在前後門中間的大踏步中，有小踏步，以利人們走上？此種大踏步中有小踏步的神廟，是很少見的。並且每一神廟所稱的闊度，係指最下踏步之尺寸為標準的。牠亦為神廟上重要部份之一。</p>
<p>（F）建築材料　希臘神廟之所以有織巧的，鮮麗的，偉大的，作品出現？原因還在於採用建築材料良好之結果也。因建築是以材料為肉體的，意匠為精神的產物，然材料因意匠而改良，意匠因材料而成立；二者互相輔助，互相補充之，以達到建築之美滿程序為止。所謂意匠者卽雕刻之技術，欲求雕刻之纖麗，則不得不愼於材料之選擇也。</p>
<p>當時建築材料用於神廟上最廣者，則首推大理石Morblo，大多用於神廟之內部屋頂上，以及柱頭之外部。大理石採用最普遍的為黃色的大理石，係從Pentus島上所運來的名之曰Penteric大理石，在世界上為極著名建築材料之一。因此等材料之花紋極細，且色彩極似人體色彩一般，故在其上雕刻人物後，因其色彩之關係，尤為生動纖麗，足以增加全部建築之美觀不少。此外神廟之地基，大多採用整塊的石灰石Jine　stone舖築之。又其殿堂之內部，總以採用有發光體之林料為主；如此，雖四週無窗戶之開置，但人入其內，也不致威到黑暗了。此其建築材料情形之一斑也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Meeting of the National Economic Council on Yellow River Management Decides on Two Proposals: Flood Diversion and River Redirection <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Council (NEC), in order to discuss the problem of the Yellow River breach and water flow, convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies at 10:00 AM on the 5th at Chen Nianzhong's residence in the Executive Yuan. Present were representatives from Shandong Province, Zhang Honglie; Jiangsu Province, Shen Baixian; the Huai River Conservancy, Xu Kai; the Yellow River Water Conservancy Association, Kong Xiangrong and Xu Xinwu; from the NEC, Qin Fen, Mao Yisheng, and Zheng Zhaojing, as well as technical personnel, totaling over twenty people. Kong Xiangxi presided over the meeting and resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the water flowing southward from the Yellow River breach, it should be diverted in two ways. A: The water flowing into Nan Zhao Lake should be directed into Dongping Lake and returned to the Yellow River. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Association and Shandong Provincial Government should be responsible for this. B: The water flowing into Weishan Lake should be directed through the Hukou Lock and Lanjia Dam, passing through the Central Canal, the Liutang River, and the Guan River to the sea. The amount of water entering the canal from Weishan Lake should be based on the maximum flow that the Central Canal can discharge. The Huai River Conservancy and Jiangsu Provincial Government should be responsible for this. (2) Regarding how to divert the water from the Dongzhuang breach back into the main river before the breach is closed, in order to reduce the rate at which the breach erodes and captures the main flow, the resolution was: the Yellow River Water Conservancy Association and Shandong Provincial Government should immediately send personnel to conduct an on-site survey of the terrain, formulate a plan for the location of the diversion channel and methods for guiding the flow, and implement it rapidly. Another meeting was held in the afternoon to discuss technical issues. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 5th, this reporter interviewed Shen Baixian and Zhang Honglie, inquiring about their views on the water situation in Jiangsu and Shandong. Shen said that in recent years, Jiangsu Province has not only paid attention to the Huai River conservancy projects, but also devoted efforts to dredging the tail reaches of the Yi and Shu Rivers. Thanks to this, the Yellow River disaster was avoided this time, and the water flow in northern Jiangsu has a regular course to follow, benefiting both Jiangsu and Shandong. Currently, the main flow of the Yellow River is heading south, and the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau is responsible for emergency protection and defense, with the principle of ensuring that Yellow River water entering Jiangsu can follow the main canal and quickly flow into the sea, minimizing the disaster area. Zhang said that he strongly agrees with the first item of the first proposal of this meeting, but whether this project can succeed depends on the water situation. The second proposal requires widening and deepening the riverbed, and building dams further away. He earnestly hopes that Jiangsu Province will make efforts to implement it. Regarding the severity of the breach, he hopes that the central government will quickly send senior officials to conduct an on-site survey and allocate large sums of money to close the breach and provide disaster relief. He has discussed this with Minister Kong, who promised to actively pursue it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Li Yi News Agency recently sent a telegram to the National Economic Council, reporting on the latest situation of the Yellow River breach, briefly stating that the remaining dikes at the five or six breaches are being protected by the Guiliu (Guixiu?) unit, but the water flow is pouring down, facing enemies on all sides, causing severe erosion, extending for about five hundred zhang. The sixth breach is still stable. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

The main current in the middle of the downstream channel is surging, and the water situation is dangerous. However, the southern embankment is still stable. The Water Conservancy Association received a report that heavy rain is still falling upstream, causing mountain floods and heavy flows, which may continue to rise. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Nan Canal reported rising water levels on the 5th. The River Affairs Bureau received a report from the second section of Baimazhen that the Dabu Canal embankment in Jiahe County is being eroded, the situation is critical, and dangerous spots are constantly appearing. Emergency repairs are underway. The River Bureau ordered intensified protection, mobilizing laborers to desperately plant willows on the 5th, and ordered the first and third sections to provide assistance. In addition, the water level in the lower reaches of the canal has reached eleven chi and six cun. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Luan River water level rose again by five chi. The Houkushi dam breached, and the breach became larger. The moat was backfilled by the river water, overflowing its banks, and flooding the city, reaching a depth of three to four chi, blocking all traffic. Hundreds of laborers are still trying to close the breach. The Lutai Ji Canal was flooded by the rising water of the Yutian Huanxiang River, with surging waves. All the farmland along the river was flooded. The Handan Fuyang River water rose continuously. Mountain floods erupted upstream, and trees, houses, livestock, and people along the river were swept away by the waves, floating everywhere. All the villages west of the Pinghan Railway were flooded, and there was not an inch of dry land left in the entire county. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Qingjiangpu) The flood control offices of the Jiangbei Canal and the tail reaches of the Yi and Shu Rivers recently received a telegram from the Commissioner stationed in Hanzhuang, stating that the Yellow River water from the Dasha River breach has directly entered Weishan Lake, increasing the water level by three cun and eight fen, and the water level in the Hanzhuang Canal has increased by three cun and five fen. The situation is very tense for flood control. On the 4th, urgent telegrams were sent to the county magistrates of Huaiyin, LianShui, SiYang, Suqian, Donghai, GuanYun, and Shuyang, ordering them to increase the conscription of laborers and repair the river dikes within their jurisdictions overnight. At the same time, engineers Guan Chengwu and Ke Tang were ordered to assist the above seven counties in repairing the dikes along the Liutang, Qiangwei, and Shaoxiang Rivers. Xia Xianglu, the fourth section chief of the Central Canal, and others urged the flood control officers in Pizhou, Suqian, and Taoyuan to repair the dike gaps, and from that day on, they would report the water levels of each river by telegram every day.

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies at 9:00 AM on the 5th to review the disaster relief measures for the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. Hu Mai, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, presided over the meeting. During the review, the three measures proposed by Xu Shiying, namely, emergency relief, work relief, and agricultural relief, were discussed at length. The result was that since Xu's original scope of relief only covered the Yangtze River basin, while the disaster situation in the Yellow River basin was also severe, it was proposed to include it. As for funding, the original plan was to allocate 900,000 yuan from the disaster relief reserve fund for the 24th year of the Republic, but it was also proposed to increase it by 100,000 yuan, totaling 1 million yuan to be allocated from the disaster relief reserve fund, to be distributed to the disaster-stricken provinces for emergency relief. It was decided to prepare a report outlining the review opinions and submit it to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 6th for a decision. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 5th to review the proposal submitted by Xu Shiying to carry out work relief, agricultural relief, and emergency relief to effectively assist the flood-stricken areas of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. Gao Bingfang of the Ministry of Finance, Cai Pei of the Ministry of Interior, Wang Shouzhen of the Relief Commission, Jin Baoshan of the Ministry of Personnel, and Jin Guanfu of the National Economic Council attended the meeting, presided over by Hu Mai of the Executive Yuan. It is reported that work relief, agricultural relief, and emergency relief were discussed item by item in detail. The discussion on raising relief funds was particularly detailed. Opinions have been noted item by item, and it is expected that they can be submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 6th for discussion and a concrete decision. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) The chief of Pei County, Su Min, telegraphed Xuzhou, saying that the newly built people's embankment north of Gaozhuang breached in two places, with the breaches being two to three zhang wide, making it impossible to close them. Therefore, the water reached the base of the Gaozhuang embankment. The chief of Feng County, Wang Xian, telegraphed, saying that the water from the Xiao embankment reached under the main embankment, and the north of the embankment was all water. Laborers gathered at the embankment to defend it. The Hanzhuang water station telegraphed that the water level at the lake entrance was 32.705 meters, and the canal water level was 32.65 meters, both higher than before. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After Shao Hanyuan inspected the northern embankment of Fengpei and directed the emergency repairs, he returned to Tongshan this afternoon. It is reported that the torrential water in northern Fengpei is flowing southward, breaching the people's embankment and reaching Gaozhuang. The water depth at the embankment base is one meter. The height of the embankment is sufficient to provide protection, but the newly built soil is loose, and if there is a strong surge, it is still a cause for concern. Zhou Shuyu, a technician from the Construction Department, has rushed to Longguji in northern Pei to survey the water situation and guide the reinforcement to strengthen the embankment. The Commissioner's Office has ordered the three counties of Feng, Pei, and Tongshan to handle three matters: (1) Prepare emergency materials for disaster relief; (2) Collect medicine for disease prevention; (3) Form roving disease prevention teams to go to the embankment for disease prevention. (Special dispatch, 5th) The water level of Weishan Lake has continued to rise for several days, and rose another 28 centimeters on the 5th, with a water level of 32.705 meters. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the Yellow River in Shanzhou rose, with a water level of 294.14 meters and a flow rate of 585 cubic meters per second. All three tributaries in this province have also risen. The River Bureau has issued a general order for strict prevention. For the Dongzhuang breach closure, it is planned to use both stone and straw materials. Lanjia Dam is the main outlet for Weishan Lake. If Jiangsu blocks the dam, not only will western and southern Shandong be flooded, but also Shengpei and Tongshan will be difficult to spare. Disputes are bound to arise. The Yellow River Commission has now dispatched a plane to measure the Dongzhuang breach. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since the discovery of large groups of bandits at various passes of the Great Wall, Zunhua, Miyun, Qian'an, and other counties have simultaneously reported emergencies. According to reports received in Beijing this morning, hundreds of bandits have infiltrated the Tangjiakou area of Zunhua, engaging in arson, murder, looting, and all kinds of evils. The area is being extremely harassed by them. At the same time, over a thousand bandits have infiltrated the Luowenyu area and occupied Hongshankou, creating a formidable situation. The special police force in the war zone seems to feel somewhat weak. Relevant parties are now ordering the special police force to unite and suppress them, using substantial force to strive for a complete suppression in the shortest possible time. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The security situation in the war zone is quite chaotic. Large and small groups of bandits along the Great Wall are all acting blindly. As of this evening, there are about one thousand bandits in the Luowenyu area, about nine hundred in the Panjiakou area, and nearly two thousand in the Xifengkou area, all holding considerable weapons. Since last night, Luanzhou has announced temporary martial law, and the situation is extremely tense. Today, telephone communications east of Tangshan were suddenly cut off, and rumors are rampant, causing disorder. (Japanese United News dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The third company of the second regiment of the Security Forces under Commander Zhang Yantian arrived at Shihexi on the evening of the 4th and began to suppress the bandits. This group of bandits has entrenched itself along Shihekou all the way to Xihaiyang west of Yuguan, refusing to retreat. Relying on the fact that Shihedong is a non-militarized zone, they stubbornly refuse to retreat. It was rumored on the 4th that this group of bandits had infiltrated Yuguan, plotting mischief. The Public Security Bureau has stepped up its alert. The Japanese army has also increased patrols. All transportation agencies in eastern Luan were under special alert on the night of the 4th to prevent bandits from rioting. Ao County was still under martial law on the 5th, with all city gates guarded by the Security Forces, checking people entering and leaving the city. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zunhua and Qian'an both reported emergencies. Liu Guitang's bandit gang is approaching the two county towns. Miyun is also tense. Commanders Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian of the first and second Security Regiments have all been dispatched to defend the areas. (Special dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yongding Fort in Qian'an County was captured by over five hundred bandits on the night of the 3rd. They looted from house to house, searching for firearms, and ordered all residents to provide food and drink. The bandits once attempted to attack the two strongholds of Hei Hanling and Erdao Pass on the morning of the 4th, but were repelled by the combined efforts of the Security Forces and the militia.

<h3 id="e15">Pawnshops Try to Shorten the Redemption Period <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Cui</p>
<p>The pawnshop industry, which is closely related to the livelihood of the common people in this city, is facing difficulties due to the economic downturn. Recently, it has been approved by the authorities to try shortening the redemption period from this month onwards, with twelve months as the maximum, to maintain operations. At the beginning of the implementation, it only involves a part of the industry. However, as the trend of the times dictates, it is expected that all the businesses in the city will follow suit. This is indeed a cause for concern for the future of the common people's livelihood.</p>
<p>The total number of pawnshops in this city originally reached more than 600. Due to the decline in business last year, they have successively shrunk. According to recent statistics, there are only about 400 left. Comparing the numbers, almost half of them are gone. The reasons for its decline can be attributed to two factors: one is the contraction of currency circulation, and the other is the gradual decline in commodity prices. The pawnshop industry needs the flow of funds to receive pledges. In this autumn of currency tightening, the source of funds is decreasing day by day, while the needs of the common people are increasing day by day. Pawnshops have no choice but to grant loans, because they can't refuse. As a result, they lack the ability to circulate funds and cannot even protect themselves. As for the gradual decline in commodity prices, it is even more difficult to sell goods that have reached the redemption period. The purpose of pawning is originally to temporarily relieve urgent needs. If the pledges are redeemed on time, it helps each other and avoids losses. It also helps the turnover of funds. However, due to the general poverty in society, those who pledge goods for money immediately think of pawnshops as the end of the line. Once a pawnshop accepts a pledge, it is no different from buying goods. In the past, pawnshops could get a good price by accepting low-value pledges and selling them at the right time. However, in recent years, the market has been sluggish and all kinds of goods are being sold off. The demand for food and daily necessities is still sluggish. Worn-out clothes and old goods are even less likely to be looked at. In addition, most of the pawned items are clothing, and the trend of the times is to pursue novelty. The longer they are kept in the warehouse, the sooner they lose their value. Even if they are sold at a discount, few people will inquire about them. The difficulties of pawnshops in business can be imagined.</p>
<p>Setting a redemption period is nothing more than to remind the pledger to redeem the pledge as scheduled. Shortening the redemption period will only lead to an increasing number of unredeemed pledges. Moreover, the purpose of this move by pawnshops is to sell the pledges earlier to supplement funds. However, the people's livelihood has been declining for a long time. If you want to buy goods, you need financial resources. If you have the ability to buy old pledges, why not buy them from the market?</p>
<p>Although shortening the redemption period of the pawnshop industry this time is a last resort, the results will not only be difficult to correct current malpractices but also harm the people's livelihood. In order to consider the difficulties of the pawnshop industry itself, it is necessary to find other ways to provide relief. Recently, the financial industry has achieved remarkable results because it has received relief from the government. The pawnshop industry is a miniature of the financial industry and is closely related to the livelihood of the common people. It is necessary for the government to protect it. Today, the Social Affairs Bureau of this city has drafted a relief plan based on the document submitted by the pawnshop industry and submitted it to the municipal meeting for discussion. Hopefully, it will meet the expectations of the industry.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central National Government held a joint memorial week at the Central Auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 5th. Present were Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Li Zonghuang, Xie Zuomin, Hong Ludong, Zheng Zhanan, Jiao Yitang, and Zeng Kuoqing, as well as Wei Huai, Chief Secretary of the National Government, and Zhu Wenzhong, Gao Lingbai, and the bureau chiefs Wen Yiyou, Xiao Qin, Chuan Xuanqing, and Fu Guangpei, Navy Commander Chen Shaokuan, and staff members of the Party Headquarters, totaling about 800 people. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Xie Zuomin reported on the recent situation of the Party, government, and military in Sichuan Province, briefly stating that since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went to Sichuan to take command of the bandit suppression military affairs, not only is the bandit situation reaching its end and their elimination is expected soon, but also the chaotic phenomenon of disunity in military and government affairs in Sichuan Province, which has been caused by the power of defense zones for more than twenty years, can also be reformed and refreshed. Over the past few months, the responsible persons in various fields have worked hard in accordance with Chairman Chiang's instructions, and there has been considerable progress in civil affairs, finance, education, etc. In particular, the abolition of excessive taxes and levies and the reduction of the people's burden have been effective, creating a close relationship between the government and the people. By earnestly implementing the New Life Movement, the long-standing negative activity and decadent atmosphere in Sichuan Province have been transformed. It can be said that everything is gradually getting on the right track. Sichuan has always been a land of abundance, and the people of Sichuan also have intelligence and talent. In the future, they will be able to give full play to their strengths. Not only will the people of Sichuan have boundless benefits, but also the revival of the nation will depend on them. Xie's speech ended at 9:00 AM, and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Abyssinian Capital) Here today, there is doubt about the League of Nations' ability to salvage the Italian-Abyssinian War. Therefore, the army continues its concentration. Military officials believe that the Italian attack will originate from Italian Eritrea, advancing towards the following three main objectives: (1) Aksum, where the former Abyssinian king massacred Italian troops; (2) Adwa, where the Italian army was defeated in 1896; and (3) Adigrat, the capital of the Akkele Guzai province. Therefore, Abyssinian troops are concentrating along this border, while other troops are moving towards the French Somaliland border. (4th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources, the Italian representative's abstention from voting on the resolution for a meeting to be held on September 4th at the League of Nations Council does not mean that Italy will not attend. However, sources still claim that a military solution must be implemented before the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be resolved. Heavy rains and mud in Italian East Africa are significantly hindering Italian military operations. Meanwhile, Italian newspapers continue to criticize the "barbaric methods" employed by Britain. The Genoa newspaper "Lavoro" claims that Britain's main objective is to annex Abyssinia into its territory in the future. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, national youth groups in the Abyssinian capital held a large-scale demonstration, which was particularly noteworthy due to the participation of 500 veterans of the Battle of Adwa. The Italian army suffered a complete defeat in that battle in 1896. These veterans carried spears and rifles used in the Battle of Adwa and delivered passionate speeches, urging the youth to emulate their example and learn from their valiant fighting. Mikael, the most powerful chieftain in southwestern Abyssinia, led 15,000 troops from the Wollo region to assist the Abyssinian king. These troops are equipped with old-fashioned rifles, each carrying 50 bullets. Mikael declared to visiting reporters that he and his troops are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the country and will never allow a foreign flag to fly over the royal palace. He said that his troops are not afraid of guns and bombs and that they marched to the capital in three weeks, believing that only one-tenth of the Italian army would reach its destination if it attempted to travel the same route.

<p>(Paris) According to a "Paris-Soir" correspondent in Rome, Italy is scheduled to hold large-scale military exercises at the end of this month near Taranto along the Austrian border, involving approximately 500,000 personnel. King Victor Emmanuel III, Prime Minister Mussolini, and Chief of Staff General Badoglio will personally command the exercises. Various new scientific inventions researched by Italian military technology agencies will also be tested. The most noteworthy of these is a "mysterious light." When used, this light can instantaneously shut down all engines in the air or on land. In certain circumstances, it can even destroy the entire enemy line instantly. It is also rumored that this weapon will be used in the war against Abyssinia. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Local newspapers report that the Italian Navy will not hold large-scale exercises this year. The Italian Navy has been largely reorganized over the past twelve months and has completed the construction of numerous new cruisers, submarines, and destroyers. In addition, two 35,000-ton super battleships are currently under construction and are expected to be completed in two years, making them the most powerful battleships in the world. Two other battleships are also being modernized and will be ready for deployment next year. (4th, National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Abyssinian Capital) Japan will supply the Abyssinian army with a quantity of new-style munitions. According to today's news, the Abyssinian government has signed a contract with Japan, stipulating that Japan will supply a large quantity of arms and ammunition in order to rapidly modernize the army. Meanwhile, preparations are being completed for Japan to send a military and commercial inspection mission to the Abyssinian capital. The issue of a mandate for Abyssinia is now receiving more attention. It is likely that the important parties involved will not object to a British or French mandate, but they will definitely not agree to an Italian mandate. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun correspondent in the Abyssinian capital hosted a forum with influential figures from Abyssinia and telegraphed the views of the Abyssinian side as follows: Selassie, Chief Secretary of the Abyssinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said, "We are very grateful for the encouraging telegrams from Japan, which are arriving like snowflakes. We firmly believe that the establishment of a Japanese embassy is a prerequisite for promoting trade and friendship between Japan and Abyssinia." Maggagne, Chairman of the Patriotic Youth League, said, "The state of trade is the same as in previous years and is quite smooth, especially trade with Japan. Japanese goods account for 80% of total imports into Abyssinia. We hope to import special goods from Japan (referring to weapons)." Negere, a powerful legal expert, said, "This Italian-Abyssinian dispute is solely caused by Mussolini and the Fascists. Seventy-five percent of the Italian people still advocate friendship with Abyssinia. It is indeed a fact that Mussolini does not have the support of the people. Italian propaganda about Japan's position in Abyssinia is so clumsy that it is astonishing." (5th, Dentsu)</p>

<p>(London) Although British officials welcome the resolution passed by the League of Nations on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, seeing it as a respite, the public senses that the future is still uncertain. The period from now until September 1st is the last chance to reach a compromise. The British government's anxiety about this can be seen in the broadcast speech by Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden, who said, "We have set a date to limit the success of negotiations; otherwise, the League of Nations Council will have to fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. There is absolutely no question of retreating in the face of difficulties or tacitly accepting the situation through delaying tactics." The Sunday Times stated that the League of Nations' mediation plan maintains the important principle of the League of Nations' responsibility. Negotiators must use their eloquence to address Italy's objections to the dispute and should strive to make its relationship with the League of Nations indirect on paper, while in practice remaining the same. If the Council's responsibility for handling this matter is ignored, it will cause a major blow to the League of Nations system and have repercussions for future international disputes, which is greatly detrimental to peace.

<p>(Brussels) During the opening of the International Exposition here today, over fifty Belgian communists suddenly gathered to demonstrate in front of the Italian "Riccardo" pavilion. Lallemand, a communist member of parliament, stood on the highest step of the marble staircase and gave a loud speech to the crowd, recounting the events of August 1914 (referring to the start of World War I, when German troops invaded Belgium) to compare them with the events of August 1935. He said, "Even today, the threat of war has returned, because the people of Abyssinia wish to live in peace and freedom, while Italian pan-nationalism seeks to throw them into flames and blood." At that time, leaflets were scattered, and the crowd gathered to listen at the foot of the staircase grew larger and larger. The demonstrators then broke into the main hall of the "Riccardo" pavilion. One of the demonstrators tried to destroy a portrait of Mussolini hanging in the pavilion, but Italian staff members intervened, leading to a conflict. Although it did not last long, one staff member was slightly injured in the disturbance. When the police arrived, they dispersed the demonstrators and arrested two people. MP Lallemand was also arrested but was quickly released. After this incident, the "Riccardo" pavilion was heavily guarded with increased police presence and temporarily closed for fifteen minutes.

Minister of National Defense Te Vandt gave a radio broadcast speech, stating, "In order to resist foreign invasions by land, we must have a well-trained army, fully equipped weapons, and a strong and agile organization. Belgium should have the border as its first line of defense, the forts built on the Haelen Plateau and the banks of the Demer River as the second line of defense, and the Meuse River, the Escaut River, and the Yser River as the third natural line of defense. We should have complete autonomy over our national defense. Only when our country is invaded by an enemy and requests assistance from friendly countries can the troops of friendly countries enter our territory. At that time, we should make preparations in advance so that the reinforcements can be sent to the front rather than retreat to the rear. If this national defense plan can proceed smoothly and be fully achieved, and if we have a well-trained and permanently serving team, then the invasion of foreign troops will be virtually impossible."

<p>(Berlin) Labor Front leader Dr. Ley stated at the National Socialist Party Congress in Essen today that there is no need for complacency in the ranks of the National Socialist Party. Faced with a major enemy, do not be complacent or allow the dangerous situation to overwhelm you. Not everyone has the belief that the National Socialist Party will survive as long as Germany exists, and the number of those who do not hold this belief seems to be increasing daily. Hitler will not only conquer Germany but will also conquer the whole world. It is God's law that unites the people with the German leader, and this is his religion, which can move mountains. Propaganda Minister Goebbels spoke, attacking foreign newspapers, Jews, and Catholics with sarcastic remarks. He predicted that a law would soon be passed prohibiting marriage between Jews and non-Jews and that those who criticize and complain would also be suppressed. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a lengthy speech at the National Socialist Party regional congress in Essen, in which he discussed the Jewish question, the church question, and the Stahlhelm question, and also made critical remarks about the attitude of various countries towards Germany. He stated, "The act of Germans marrying Jews can no longer be tolerated, as we cannot allow the mixing of German blood to be seen in our descendants. Therefore, this national struggle must continue. On the one hand, we should recognize our own strength, and on the other hand, we should recognize the enemy's tricks, so as not to be fooled by them. Foreign newspapers often misunderstand this action of Germany, thinking that there is panic within the National Socialist state, but this is not the case. What we are doing is merely a process of elimination, treatment, and purification, the purpose of which is to maintain the integrity of racial values. In the past, disputes arose because of Jewish provocations, and we have always tolerated them. Some comrades in our party can no longer understand this attitude of tolerance. In short, we should treat Jews according to how Jews treat us. For the sake of the Jewish people, since they have resided in our country, they should abide by German laws and keep themselves clean. As for the church question, we do not want to engage in a Kulturkampf (referring to the anti-Catholic movement led by Bismarck during his administration), but judging from recent facts, some people in certain aspects of the Catholic Church seem to be eager to stir up this Kulturkampf. We should wait and see how we will deal with these church figures in the coming weeks, which will not be difficult for the world to understand. In short, what we are doing is dealing with affairs in the real world, while what the church manages is the spiritual world. Therefore, it is not helpful for the church to issue newspapers and interfere in current affairs. Moreover, the National Socialist movement is the sole representative of the political will of the country. Therefore, we oppose not only left-wing political enemies but also the right-wing Stahlhelm, as we do not want them to be an obstacle to the National Socialist Party." Goebbels then mentioned the Abyssinian question and made many sarcastic remarks about the great powers, saying in essence that a few years ago, various countries signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact in Paris, opposing the resolution of international disputes through war, but not long after, the crisis of war is imminent. From now on, various governments and newspapers should shift their focus from Germany to their own domestic affairs, so that they can recognize their own weaknesses. He also said, "The act of shooting at residential houses with machine guns does not need to be sought in Germany. Germans have also never forcibly removed the flag of any foreign country (referring to the recent incident in New York where the German mail steamer Bremen had its flag removed by American communists). Only other 'civilized countries' have this 'privilege.' Moreover, the British do not need to travel across the ocean from London to Berlin to see a few broken pieces of glass in front of Jewish stores, as not far from London, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, we can openly see several houses being destroyed. As for the French, they seem to concentrate on paying attention to the substitute legal orders issued by their government regarding budget adjustments, rather than worrying about the economic panic in Germany."

For the sake of the welfare of the entire country, various special groups within the country are currently "not only useless but also harmful." Therefore, there is no reason for their existence.

<p>(Berlin) Former member of the Reichstag Keiser was found guilty of high treason by the People's Court today and sentenced to death. This is the second death sentence handed down by the court.

<p>(Warsaw) Since Danzig announced a non-military state of emergency, Polish officials have been planning to adopt economic blockade measures to cripple the port of Danzig. Poland and Danzig are each planning to increase troops on the border. Officials here are deeply concerned about provoking Germany's resentment and stated that they will not occupy Danzig's customs checkpoints. However, in order to force Danzig to abandon its anti-Polish commercial and monetary policies, they must take various economic measures against Danzig. (5th, National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Vienna) The Austrian government today ordered a ban on official propaganda for the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty and prohibited local governments from granting honorary citizenship to Archduke Otto. Those familiar with the matter believe that this action by the Austrian government is an attempt to resolve the restoration issue through diplomatic channels. Therefore, unless the Little Entente does not object, they would not dare to welcome Otto back to Austria. (5th, National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Washington) Senator Gibson stated today that he will introduce a bill in the Senate to increase the government's control over territories and establish a dedicated colonial department. The position of the minister will be equal to that of other cabinet members. Currently, the administrative agencies for US territories are not unified. For example, Hawaii and Alaska belong to the Department of the Interior, Guam and Johnston Island belong to the Department of the Navy, and the Philippines and Panama are directly under the Department of the Army. Gibson also said that the United States is the only country in the world with such a system. The Washington Naval Treaty will expire in 1936. At that time, if the United Kingdom and Japan do not agree to renew the naval ratio system, the United States will also be free to fortify its islands to maintain its dominance in the Pacific. However, before implementing fortification, if all territories can be governed by a single department, then unified authority and progress can be facilitated. In recent years, similar proposals have been made several times, but they have not been implemented due to two difficulties: first, this plan would make the United States too imperialistic; and second, Philippine leaders oppose it because they believe this move would jeopardize the independence movement. Although the second obstacle has now been removed, the United States still retains the right to fortify the Philippines. Gibson also said that he has been studying this issue for a long time and believes that the United States should have a strong defense in the Philippines, which is even more important now than it has been in the past.

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira's intention to resign is very firm. Former Ambassador to Italy Yoshida Shigeru's succession suddenly has momentum. The formal order will be issued approximately before November 17, when Yoshida is waiting for orders. Although Foreign Minister Hirota's efforts to persuade Ambassador Matsudaira to stay have not ceased, Matsudaira himself has decided to retire bravely at this time and must find a successor. Matsudaira himself believes that his terms of three years in the United States and seven years in the United Kingdom are too long and he is eager to give way to a worthy successor. In addition, in the disarmament conference, various parties have acknowledged his skill in requesting equal military strength last fall, and he does not delay his successful retreat, leaving room for future special tasks. Ambassador Matsudaira requested leave in July, so it will not be too late to decide whether to stay or go before February of next year. Ambassador Yoshida's waiting period expires in November, so Foreign Minister Hirota must decide on the change of Ambassador to Britain this autumn. (5th, Dentsu)</p>

<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry held a plenary meeting yesterday, Sunday, in the morning and afternoon. Deputy Minister Ohashi, Chief of the Soviet-Russian Section of the European Bureau Yoshizawa, and diplomatic representatives from Harbin, Suifenhe, Daheihe, Manzhouli, etc. attended. Deputy Minister Ohashi first said that the frequent border disputes between Manchukuo and Russia are a matter of deep concern. The reason for this is the illegal border crossings and violations of the border by the Soviet-Russian side. "Manchukuo" has repeatedly issued warnings and protests. However, of the 50 incidents since the founding of the country, only 20% have been resolved. If this is allowed to continue, it will cause serious incidents in diplomatic relations and even adversely affect the peace of the Far East. Therefore, it is hoped that a fundamental policy toward Russia will be decided to ensure complete security. After deliberation, the following emergency measures were established:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the protests against the Soviet-Russian side's frequent illegal border crossings, border violations, and illegal shootings, because the Russian side is not sincere in responding, the Russian side should be urged to reflect deeply. (2) In order to demarcate the border line, which is the cause of frequent disputes, it is advocated to establish a Japan-Manchukuo-Russia border demarcation committee. Japan and Manchukuo will make preparations. If Soviet-Russia hopes to resolve the matter with sincerity, a tripartite border demarcation committee will be established immediately. (5th, Dentsu)</p>

(Fifth day, Dentsu telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The disrespectful incident involving the American magazine "Vanity Fair" has prompted Foreign Minister Hirota to send a telegram instructing Ambassador Saito in the United States to call the attention of the American government. It is generally believed that the central government has the authority of publishing laws, so it is different from the problems of persecution of Japanese and Manchurian people in the western states. It should be easy to prohibit and resolve. However, the Foreign Ministry believes that the special feelings of the Japanese people towards the imperial family cannot tolerate this disrespectful incident. If the American government takes a laissez-faire attitude, it is difficult to predict whether an incident will occur due to the intensification of Japanese national sentiment. Therefore, it is planned to restrict the distribution of such magazines and demand future prohibitions. However, it remains to be seen how the American government, which respects freedom of speech, will handle the prohibition. (Fifth day, Dentsu telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) The American satirical magazine "Vanity Fair" recently published a cartoon about the Japanese Emperor, which has aroused dissatisfaction from the Japanese authorities.

If it is published by a publication with serious content, there may be something to defend. If it is a publication that focuses on humor, like our magazine, then even if a cartoon is published, it will not cause any disputes because it has no significant meaning. For example, our magazine has published no less than ten cartoons about President Roosevelt in the past. The President has always accepted them with a smile and even purchased multiple copies of each issue to give to friends. We have never heard any criticism from him." The editor also said that only 500 copies of the issue containing the aforementioned cartoon were sent to Japan. (Fourth day, Havas telegram)</p>

<p>Shishou County Representatives Telegraphed the Whole County's Disaster Situation Shanghai Zhongbao Newspaper Office's Honorable Gentlemen, Shishou County has been hit by disasters one after another. The people of our county have suffered from the destruction of the bandits since the 19th year, and have experienced military disasters. In the 20th year, a flood caused the disaster, the dikes were breached, and the houses were in ruins. They have been displaced and suffered from repeated disasters and calamities. The people are suffering unspeakable hardships. The people have not yet recovered from their difficulties when another disaster struck. Unexpectedly, this year, a natural disaster came suddenly. At the beginning of the summer, heavy rain fell for days, and the ground suddenly dropped several feet, causing the river to rise sharply and the floods to overflow. Our dikes are mostly Yangtze River dikes, which were repaired by the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. On the 8th, the Daxingwan, Dongdawan, Huangshan Dawan, Jidiwan, and Luochengwan dikes breached one after another, affecting the entire county, inundating about 500,000 mu of farmland, and causing tens of thousands of deaths. Factories and houses were washed away, and people were displaced. According to reports from various districts and villages, the dead have been washed away by the waves, and the living are either sheltering on trees or dikes. This flood is滔天搖川漫野,畜類水中作圈,男女樹上為窠, and it is hard to find food or clothing from morning till night. All of this is the result of the collapse of the river dikes, which has caused countless tragedies in the entire county. Because the flood came so suddenly, the local area was caught off guard. The solidity of the river dikes was of no use. A safe area suddenly became a泽国. The palaces and chambers were all connected to the fishes, and the land turned into江河. It is pitiful to see the flood drowning the crops, and the people in a state of恓惶. There is nothing the people can rely on, and the villages have become like燕 without nests, and the surplus grain is ashes, all waiting to be fed. After the disaster, there is 薰蒸烈日, the 腸鳴五內, they are dwelling on ruined walls,露宿終宵, without shelter from wind and rain, and even more unable to fill their hunger. Cries can be heard all over the fields, and饿殍載道. The sight is unbearable, and those who see it lose their hearts. The pitiful survivors are垂毙, and it is difficult to go to the coming days,待振孔殷. This representative feels it is dangerous and the righteous are difficult to silence. I respectfully present the situation of the flood disaster suffered by the whole county, so that the Cí鑒 may be examined and verified. According to the express will, we safeguard the righteousness of the disaster victims and publish it in the newspaper to widely publicize it, to move the compassion of the benevolent, to invite the宏施of righteousness, to 起死回生,胜造浮亂之七级拯灾救难, and implement merits to all people. I am too much for the临书, and the 至翘企蹙续. Shishou County disaster victims' representatives Liu Yulong, Gao Moxian, Xia Chunrong, and Tang Ruisong.</p>
<p>New Wild and Five Counties Need Urgent Relief Telegraph Shanghai Shenbao Hall Transfers to Central Party Department, National Government, All Ministries, All Governments, Municipal Governments, All Halls and Bureaus, All Legal Groups, All Charitable Organizations, All Nations' Red Cross Societies, All Nations' Red Swastika Societies, China Jisheng Society, Sino-Foreign Righteous Relief Association, All Overseas Chinese in Various Countries, Central Overseas Chinese Committee, National Government Relief Committee All鉴, The five counties of Ye, Xiangyang, Nanyang, Dengxian, and Tanghe are located in the border of the province, adjacent to northern Hubei and southern Henan. The Xinye Baihe Tanghe Lihe Tuanhe Shahe Diaohe river, folding south, runs straight through Xiangyang, and enters the Hanjiang River from Xianghe.昊天不第,久旱望雨, unexpectedly on the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month, heavy rain poured down, non-stop day and night. 河伯肆虐, the ground rises like蛟, the flood bursts out, and the momentum is like 天降. The waves are汹涌, coming across the sky. The water head is more than two zhang high, and the low one is also one zhang and two feet high. As a result, the dikes on the banks of the rivers in the five counties collapsed simultaneously. Within one day, the ground of the five counties became 泽国. Because the water came too violently, the villagers were caught off guard 汪洋恣肆, the people and animals drowned, and the properties helped the east flow. Tens of thousands of villages were swept away, and fertile land became deserts. The rich families became beggars, and the middle-class families became饿莩. The so-called disasters in northern Hubei are all the aftermath of southern Henan, and the great flood in Hubei is also attributed to this number. We lament that the five counties suffered this鞠凶, an unprecedented catastrophe, which far exceeded Xiangzhe. However, Nanyang, Dengxian, and Tanghe were the first in the upper reaches, and the water势 was slower, but Xinye and Xiangyang</p>
<p>County suffered exceptionally severe flooding. The grains of wheat were gone, the houses collapsed, the people and animals drowned, and the clothing was scattered. The total loss of more than 400,000 households in the five counties is nearly one hundred and fifty million or more. The disaster is exceptionally severe and unprecedented. Two million disaster victims in the five counties are still in deep waters, without food or clothing, 風餐露宿,嗷嗷待哺,困苦萬狀,筆難盡述. People are good and benevolent, who is not as good as me,己饥己溺,谅有同情. A drop in the bucket is of little help, and a grand move depends on one. For this, we urge to allocate huge funds, or 慨解义囊, to quickly transfer them down so that they can be distributed quickly to relieve the five counties from the abyss and save the people from death. The kindness of thousands of families is immeasurable. The five counties' culture, education, and community associations thank you 敬蒸印and pay homage to the God, on behalf of the two million lives in the five counties!</p>

<h3 id="e53">Inspection Report on Flood Disaster Areas: Special Correspondent Keng Ya for This Newspaper: Tragic Scenes in Hanchuan and Paradise in Yuekou <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Sixty li from Xingou, one arrives at Hanchuan. Disembarking from the steamboat, one sees high and thick embankments. The entire city is submerged, yet this embankment stands alone, towering. Consequently, nearby residents have fled here to escape the disaster. Besides the existing shops, countless new straw sheds have been added, making passage for a single person difficult. At first glance, it seems like a bustling marketplace. However, upon closer inspection, nine out of ten are disaster victims struggling on the brink of death. Turning and winding through the alleys, one reaches the city wall. The accumulated water still covers two-thirds of its height. Stagnant and unmoving for a long time, the water has turned green. Tadpoles, frogs, toads, and lizards leap and swim freely. The city gate is submerged in deep water, making it impassable. However, a small boat can enter and exit through a breach in the southwest city wall. In the higher-lying streets and alleys, wooden bridges have been erected where boats cannot reach, similar to what was seen in Anqing and Jiujiang. However, the disaster situation here is particularly severe. The residents are either dead or have fled, creating a thick atmosphere of gloom.</p>
<p>Hanchuan's terrain is low-lying. The Xiang River cuts through the county, dividing it into northern and southern parts. Both rely on embankments for protection. On July 4th, the river water gradually rose, but the situation seemed stable. Unexpectedly, by the 8th, the Lion's Mouth in Zhongxiang, Duobao Bay in Jingshan, and Maojia Dike in this county all collapsed in succession. The water surged six or seven feet high, rushing in. The Penggong Dike on the south bank of the Xiang River, consisting of seventy-two embankments of varying sizes, plays a crucial role in preventing the Xiang River from overflowing and preventing the Yangtze River from backflowing from Dunkou. Unfortunately, the Suozi Embankment near the Xiang River also suffered a large breach, plunging the entire county into deep water. On the 13th, Nanping Dam was also breached by the Yangtze River flooding from Tunkou. The combined disaster from the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers further intensified the tragedy.</p>
<p>The floodwaters arrived like an avalanche, breaking into the city. It happened on the evening of the 8th. Initially, the people in the city sought refuge on tables and benches. Then, they climbed to the upper floors. Finally, they tore down doors and tiles, scrambling onto the rooftops, shouting for help. Fortunately, dawn was breaking, and the county government managed to gather thirty small boats for a swift rescue operation, transporting people to Fairy Maiden Mountain and the dike streets. Since the two locations were close, rescue was relatively easy. Therefore, although the material losses in the city were significant, no one drowned. However, in rural villages like "Tian Er He, etc.," deep within the embankments, the floodwaters surrounded and submerged the entire village. Men, women, and children were all swept away by the floodwaters, with not a single survivor. From then on, human habitation ceased. It was truly a tragedy.</p>
<p>According to an investigation by the Hanchuan Flood Relief Committee, the disaster area accounts for 95% of the county's area. Over 480,000 mu of farmland have been affected, with agricultural losses estimated at over 14 million yuan. Approximately 5,000 people have drowned, and there are over 360,000 disaster victims, accounting for about nine-tenths of the total population. Furthermore, the accumulated water in various places will only recede when the water levels of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers drop by several feet. Unlike other counties where the water recedes faster and autumn crops can still be planted, the food supply here is not only a major concern now but will also be a problem next spring.</p>
<p>Boarding a steamboat in Hanchuan, a county official named Liu, escorting prisoners to Mianyang, said, "In this flood, the successive breaches of the embankments were partly due to the rapid rise of the floodwaters, making prevention difficult. However, it was also due to the embankment bureau's supervisors consistently neglecting their duties, failing to take preventive measures beforehand, and embezzling funds for emergency repairs. Therefore, the farmers are quite resentful and have said that if they could get their hands on Mr. So-and-So, the supervisor, they would throw him into the flood to accompany the thousands of innocent people who have drowned." In the years 1928 and 1929, Hanchuan's four rural districts were once part of the Honghu Red Zone. On the Fairy Maiden Mountain and the shores of Diaoxiao Lake, traces of past battles are still faintly visible. The farmers are straightforward and bold, which has its origins. It is understandable that they want to get their hands on Mr. So-and-So to appease their anger. However, general neglect of duty by officials should be taken as a warning.</p>
<p>Passing by Jinmakou, Yangchikou, Chenghuanggang, Bengkoukou, Fenshuizui, and other docks, looking out from the embankment, the disaster situation was not very evident. Nearby are six embankments: Huanggong, Hefeng, Taian, Baiyu, Xie, and Tianchi. Thanks to the county magistrate's supervision and the efforts of the villagers in emergency repairs, Huanggong Embankment was protected first, and the other five embankments safely weathered the crisis. This is the only clean land in the entire county, a testament to the idea that human determination can overcome nature. Further along to Maiwangzui, a small town also near the river, originally belonging to Mianyang, will soon be incorporated into Hanchuan. Mianyang's land is fertile, and its agricultural products are abundant. However, the continuous lakes and streams make it prone to flooding. Hence the saying: "Sand Lake and Mianyang Island, nine years out of ten bring no harvest. If there is a harvest one year, even the dogs won't eat the pot-bottom porridge." However, this year's massive floods in neighboring areas have left Mianyang unable to escape. Fortunately, the disaster area in Mianyang only reaches thirty to forty percent. One reason is that the Xiang River, after flooding from Zhongxiang, mostly flowed along the northern bank of the river. Another reason is the continuous strong south winds, which aided the water's power. As a result, the northern embankment of the Xiang River was first breached by the wind and waves, and then the floods and strong winds continued to sweep north. As a result, the disaster in northern Xiang was more severe than in southern Xiang. Most of Mianyang County is in southern Xiang, so it was fortunate to have escaped unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Fifty-five li southwest of Maiwangzui lies Xiantao Town, belonging to the ninth district of Mianyang County. This town has always been a strategic military location and a hub for commercial goods. It has a large population and a thriving market, and is commonly known as "Little Hankou." The steamed dishes of "Good Food Street" and the bamboo utensils of "Bamboo Utensil Street" are delicious, exquisite, and highly praised. After this major disaster, because it is a center for industry and commerce, many wealthy households from various villages have come here to reside, causing the market to become more prosperous. However, the sustainability of this prosperity may be as fleeting as the ephemerality of the night-blooming cereus. According to an investigation by the Ninth District Office of Mianyang, over 6,000 households have been flooded. The number of people affected is over 15,000 men and over 15,000 women. The losses of houses and fields are countless.</p>
<p>Wooden Bridge in the Streets of Hanchuan</p>
<p>Upstream from Xiantao, passing through places like Duoxiang River, Mayangtan, Pengshi River, Hengkou, and Shuangheyuan, most of the houses are collapsed and uninhabitable. People have temporarily built straw huts on high embankments or next to green willows as a temporary shelter to prevent future disasters. They also tie small boats to the pillars of their homes and build wooden nests high in the trees. The situation is pitiful. The breach in Shuangheyuan is about thirty to forty zhang wide and two to three zhang deep. The water is still flowing out, no wonder it has caused disaster in several counties for over ten days.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Yuekou, 120 li from Xiantao, the scene is completely renewed. Shops stand side by side, and the market is bustling with people, almost surpassing Xiantao. Yuekou has an open-air theater. Previously, due to the sluggish market, there were very few ticket buyers. The livelihood of the male and female actors largely depended on the support of the stationed troops. Now, after the flood disaster, the night shows are suddenly always sold out. Various industries have also seen a turnaround. The Deyue and Cuihua Buildings, which also operate tea houses, restaurants, and bathing facilities, are tall and well-equipped. They have the air of "the wine in the jar is empty, but the seats are still full." Some wealthy merchants and large businessmen call prostitutes, sing songs, and stay up all night under the glow of kerosene lamps. In other tea houses and private homes, men and women gather to gamble on cards or play mahjong, which is common. Gambling has always been rampant in the areas along the river. However, Yuekou is a large town in a county that has been severely affected by the floods in Hubei. While the floodwaters have not receded in the four rural districts, the townspeople are so debauched, heartless, numb, and beyond reason. It is excessive.</p>
<p>The town has a county-run Yuekou Complete Primary School, which is relatively well-equipped, and two or three private primary schools with quite a few students. However, it seems that not much attention has been paid to social education. Because the citizens do not have access to formal newspapers, most of them gather at street bookstalls and arbitrarily purchase or listen to the reading of "Mulian Saves His Mother," "New Woman Abducts Man," "Jia's Fan Over the Tomb," "Grandpa Burning Fire," "Second Daughter Gives Dowry," and other nonsensical woodblock books. This is harmful to their minds, bodies and waste of time. I asked a bookseller, "Which books sell well?" He replied, "All books sell on normal days, but recently, 'One Hundred Lotus Flowers' have been especially popular. Each book costs 160 wen, and on average, we sell 15 or 16 copies a day." Out of curiosity, I flipped through the contents and found that it was a Qing Dynasty edition compiled for beggars to sing lotus flower ballads.</p>
<p>Shayang Collaborates with the People to Save the Disaster</p>
<p>Upstream from Yuekou, the river water gradually becomes shallower. The steamboat constantly probes the river with poles. However, it still runs aground once. The rise and fall of the Xiang River are unpredictable, and it sometimes flows south and sometimes north. The degree of curvature is often as large as a right angle. From Yuekou to Shayang, the waterway is 180 li, but according to the land mail route, it is only 60 li. Most of the waterway phenomena that hydraulic engineers consider most dangerous and undesirable can be seen in the Xiang River. The steamboat's first mate and the passengers generally believe that this is "a manifestation of the power of the river gods and demons, and there is no way to use human power to overcome nature." It is lamentable to hear this. A passenger talked about the disaster situation in Jingshan, claiming that "on July 8th at 4:00 AM, due to the breach of Dike Numbers Three and Four in Zhongxian, the floodwaters swept down Yonglong River, reaching a height of two zhang. As a result, the fourth and fifth districts of the county were most severely affected. Villages such as Xieyanggang, Guanyinge, and Yonglonghe Qiancun suffered a terrible disaster in terms of houses and population, with no one spared." He also said, "This flood was most severe in counties such as Tianmen, Hanchuan, Qianjiang, and Jingshan, all of which were once areas severely affected by the Red Disaster. Yuekou Town has a dense population, industry, and commerce. The surrounding area is known for its bandits, and security measures are usually strict. However, in 1930 and 1931, it was captured by the communists three times. In the first communist street battle, some of the remaining communists seized the bodies of those who died in battle, grabbed their legs, and dragged them away like rickshaws. In the latter two times, the number of communists doubled, forcing wealthy merchants to hand over tens of thousands of yuan in cash. They paid market prices for goods purchased in the city and for hired boat fares. The person giving orders was He Long's sister, He Ying, who was valiant, had a dark complexion, rode a white horse, and carried a box cannon, with five or six female followers. She gave speeches everywhere and was seen by many." The old wounds have not healed, and a new disaster has struck. The suffering of the people of Xiangcheng cannot be described in a single piece of paper.</p>
<p>Zhangjiegang is 45 li from Yuekou. The villages are about a li away from the riverbank. During the flood, people took refuge on high ground, and the straw huts they built are still new. Passing through Zekou, Huangjia, Changleyuan, and arriving at Duobaowan, the river channels are winding, and the water flows in circles. The grass, trees, and miscellaneous objects washed down from the upper reaches are hanging from the willow branches and eaves of the houses. In Duobaowan, a considerable number of human corpses were also retrieved. At one point, a male corpse was drifting near the embankment, with its arms and legs bent, floating face down like a frog. The buttocks and upper arms were particularly swollen and blood red. It seemed to be unclothed. Suddenly seeing this as the boat approached made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Remembering that on the way here, I was on the same boat as Mr. Xu Shiying's party, and we were gazing at the Yangtze River from the rail near Wuxue. Mr. Xu Gongshi once said, "The newspapers report that many corpses are floating in the river, but why haven't we seen any?" He seemed to have the attitude that one must see floating corpses to truly understand the disaster. At that time, I also thought about the saying that "male corpses float face down, and female corpses float face up." Now, seeing the tragic state of the floating corpses, I could not help but make a great vow, silently praying that I would not see them again. The first mate, perhaps aware of my feelings, smiled and said, "This is nothing. The previous times we went upstream, the men, women, children, chickens, dogs, and pigs washed down were endless. There were also straw houses or roof frames floating down, with live chickens perched on them, flapping their wings. Water buffaloes can float, and yellow cattle, dogs, and pigs that were trying to reach the embankment out of desperation have died and their bellies are swollen like drums. They drifted with the waves. When our boat first encountered the flood, it tilted and almost capsized. We quickly dropped anchor and tied it to the willows, staying there for two days and nights before we could escape safely. Although we felt sorry for the floating people and animals, there was nothing we could do to save them." After climbing the Five Sacred Mountains, one does not look at other mountains. One should not be surprised that after seeing floating corpses, many people point and sigh, while the first mate seems to see nothing at all.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Shayang, the wind and waves suddenly rose, and the dry sand on the river beach was also flying and blinding. The steamboat was anchored in the middle of the river when more than ten small boats swarmed forward, all vying to help the steamboat in order to solicit passengers to the shore. Another small boat came from the shore, carrying two water police officers. One officer, tall and carrying a box cannon, and two policemen, each with short guns, were preparing to board the steamboat for inspection. Unexpectedly, when the officer was about to step onto the boat, one foot was on the small boat helping, and the other foot was still on the original small boat. The weight of the small boats was unbalanced, and the wind and waves caused it to capsize. The two police officers fell into the river, dropped their guns, and quickly clung to other boats. They were rescued by the crowd. The officer transferred his anger to the steamboat and boarded the boat to take the first mate away. Later, the "Chief of the Third Sub-Bureau" Tang Zuoxin sent personnel to investigate and clarified the truth, and announced that the first mate was innocent and released him. One of the lost guns was recovered that night. Fortunately, no water police officers drowned in this unexpected turmoil, and no innocent people were harmed.</p>
<p>Shayang belongs to the ninth district of Jingmen. The terrain is low-lying and suffers from floods every year. The people are experienced in flood prevention work. Although the flood overflowed into the town this time, it did not cause major damage. On July 8th, 9th and 13th, the Xiang River burst. The residents were each rowing small boats and assisting the water police to go to various villages to rescue people. Within 20 li of the surrounding area, only about ten people died. Further away, countless people drowned. The water police also worked hard to retrieve the corpses. According to statistics, Shayang retrieved more than 100 bodies, Jiukou 200 bodies, and Maliang, Sanguanmiao, etc., a total of more than 300 bodies. Most of the corpses were middle-aged men and women because they were trying to protect their property and were drowned. As for the elderly and children, they were tied high to trees in advance or sent to the roofs, so they were spared. After the 11th, the water gradually receded. Those rescued had suffered three or four days of starvation and could hardly speak. Shayang raised over 300 yuan to buy flour and steam buns to distribute. However, the amount of money was small, and the time was short. It was a drop in the bucket, and perhaps only one in ten benefited. Also, during the flood, nameplates from Nanyang County, Henan Province, were washed here, indicating the vastness of the disaster area upstream.</p>
<p>Shayang's agricultural products mainly consist of peanuts, sesame seeds, cotton, and grains. There are cars on land and steamboats on the water, which makes transportation convenient. There is also an electricity company. In previous years, trade was considerable. Before the disaster, the price of grain was about 8 diao per dou (equivalent to $1.10 in silver), broad beans 2.3 to 4 diao, and sesame oil 16 yuan per 100 jin. After the flood, prices have risen. Grain is now 11 to 12 diao per dou, broad beans 3.1 to 2 diao, and oil has soared to 28 yuan.</p>
<p>The breached dikes must be repaired quickly to prevent the so-called "New Year's rise" unique to the Xiang River at the end of winter and the beginning of spring. Also, do not use the contract system for dike repairs again, in order to save costs and reduce materials, resulting in unstable dikes and endless harm. The breach of the 72 dikes this time was precisely due to this problem. Learn from the past to avoid future mistakes. Responsible authorities, please do not disregard this advice.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Meeting of Various Agencies in Hubei Province: Methods for Dredging Rivers and Constructing Dikes; Construction to Begin Half a Month After the Xiang River Main Dam Breach; 2 Million Needed for Repairing the Zhanggong and Wuhui Dikes; Request for the National Water Conservancy Commission to Coordinate the Dredging of the Changting River <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, considering the severe floods this year and the urgent need for both temporary and permanent solutions to ensure long-term relief, has issued a general order to Hunan province, instructing the construction of dikes and dams. He also called upon refugees to work on these projects in exchange for food. Simultaneously, he implemented labor conscription according to the "Regulations for People's Labor Service," promulgated by the General Headquarters. Hubei Province, located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, must act without delay. After receiving the order, Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun instructed the Department of Construction to convene a joint meeting with the Department of Civil Affairs, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the Flood Relief General Association. Initial discussions over two days yielded no concrete solutions. At the third meeting, the following five decisions were made: (1) Dredging the Yangtze River is beyond the capacity of a single province and should be coordinated by the National Water Conservancy Commission. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau will design the dredging of the Xiang River. (2) The Department of Construction, in conjunction with the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, will conduct a survey and statistics of dikes throughout the province. (3) The Jianghan Engineering Bureau will be responsible for the repair, inspection, and maintenance of dikes and sluices. (4) Refugees in disaster-stricken areas will be employed in public works projects in exchange for food. (5) In areas with autumn harvests, labor will be conscripted according to the "Regulations for People's Labor Service" to repair dikes, following the guidelines of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau.</p>
<p>The Jianghan Engineering Bureau had previously received repeated orders to expedite the construction of breached dikes along the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers and had already commenced planning. It was decided to first construct the breached main dikes in the areas of Jiukou, Jingshan, and Zhongxiang on the Xiang River to prevent autumn floods. Two surveying teams were dispatched on the 2nd to conduct measurements, with construction scheduled to begin in two weeks. Other breached dikes will be repaired gradually through public works projects in exchange for food. Dikes that have not been breached will be reinforced through labor conscription. The Zhanggong Dike in Hankou, which remained intact after the flood, has been taken over by the Bureau. Today, the Wuhui Dike in Wuchang also escaped danger and was also taken over by the Bureau. Considering the two dikes as vital safeguards for Wuhan, which fortunately did not collapse, the Bureau intends to quickly reinforce the dike body and protect the dike foundation, requesting 2 million yuan for the repair of both dikes. For other dike repair expenses throughout the province, a proposal has been submitted to the National Economic Commission to allocate a ten-year fund entirely for this year's annual maintenance projects to ensure consolidation. The current flood prevention expenses amount to over 800,000 yuan.

<p>Songjiang: Han Yifei Exposed for Trafficking Opium</p>
<p>Li Genyuan, the owner of the Yuanxing Opium Den at Xiuye Bridge outside the West Gate, was apprehended by the Public Security Bureau's special task force the day before yesterday. Five packages of private opium, bearing the Xiangtai brand, were found on his person. He claimed to have purchased them from Han Yifei. Han's hidden opium was very well concealed in a false bottom of a chamber pot in his bedroom, making it initially difficult to locate. Consequently, officers from the Second Sub-Station of the Public Security Bureau were dispatched to Han's residence, where they seized the chamber pot with the false bottom and opium paraphernalia. All items and the suspect were handed over to the county bureau and then forwarded to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>

They requested the association to forward the complaint to the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Judicial Administration for severe punishment. The association immediately raised the issue at its deliberation meeting, which resolved as follows: (1) The matter concerns damage to the reputation of all lawyers and disruption of the judicial system, making silence impossible.

<p>Wuxi: The Zhenxin Factory Labor Dispute Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>The Zhenxin Cotton Mill outside the West Gate, facing difficulties due to the high cost of cotton and low price of yarn, and exacerbated by repeated labor unrest caused by unpaid wages, had become increasingly severe. The factory temporarily suspended operations on the 1st of this month.

They convened a meeting the day before yesterday and unanimously decided to petition the County Government Public Security Bureau to promptly dismiss and severely punish him. Failing that, they would elect representatives to petition the provincial government. They have already collected evidence and submitted it to the County Government Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation and punishment to uphold the law.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Three Districts Report Drought and Famine</p>
<p>Wu Zongjin, the director of the Third District of Wujin County, reported that since the beginning of summer, the six townships and towns of Longting, Renxing, Shiqiao, Mengcheng, Zhengli, and Wansui in the district have experienced scarce rainfall, totaling less than 0.5 Chinese feet. The water in the ditches and ponds has long been evaporated by the intense sun. Currently, bean seedlings are withering, and rice seedlings are scorched. All types of red, green, and black beans, sesame, and other crops are damaged by leaf rollers, black cutworms, and other pests. A plague has broken out, and the future harvest is hopeless. Yesterday (4th), he specially reported to the county government, requesting the swift dispatch of personnel for on-site inspection and relief efforts.</p>

<p>Nantong: A Promising Cotton Harvest</p>
<p>In the counties under the jurisdiction of Nantong in Jiangbei and the coastal reclamation areas of Huainan, although the cotton planting initially suffered from drought, subsequent heavy rains and hot summer weather with a suitable balance of sun and rain have led to excellent cotton seedling growth. The cotton plants are now blossoming and forming bolls, promising a full harvest. The market is showing positive signs due to the expected bumper harvest of new cotton in the autumn.</p>
<p>The Nantong District Commissioner's Position Remains Vacant</p>
<p>Zheng Yitong, the administrative inspector of the Nantong District, has left Nantong to take up a new position as a member of the provincial government.

<p>Haimen: Notorious Opium Trafficker Arrested</p>
<p>Zhang Yuncheng (from Ziyang, Shandong Province, currently residing in Hexi, Haimen County), a notorious opium trafficker in the county, has been trafficking and selling private opium in various districts for years, amassing significant profits. Due to his careful planning, he has never been caught. On the morning of the 3rd, Zhang transported a large quantity of private opium from Shanghai by sea and landed at Niuhong Port. About a mile north of the port, he was stopped and inspected by police officers Zhang Yucheng and others from the Public Security Bureau, who found his bags suspicious.

<p>In the bamboo forest of Faha Temple on the banks of the Slender West Lake in the northern suburbs of Yangzhou, an unusual flower has suddenly bloomed, with five colors on one stem, said to be auspicious. Visitors come morning and evening to admire it. The red flower gradually turns into tender pink, tender yellow, tender green, ocher yellow, and powdery white, all five colors. The stem is straight, and the petals are shattered, with five segments. The petals resemble velvet embroidery and seem to speak in the wind, captivating observers. Some people identify it as Qionghua, but it is uncertain whether that is the case.</p>
<p>Lawsuit Against Widow for Arranging Granddaughter's Marriage Without Consent</p>
<p>Wu Youchao, a farmer from Caowang Township in the county, filed a lawsuit because his widowed daughter-in-law, Wu Xiao, had been living separately since her husband's death. She inherited thirteen and four-tenths acres of land and an orphaned daughter, Yu Mei. Currently, Ms. Wu is involved in an affair with Chen Songxiu. The land has dwindled to only eight acres, and she intends to marry Yu Mei (age seven) to Chen Songxiu's son. Citing Article 973 of the Civil Code, which prohibits marriage contracts for girls under the age of fifteen, Wu Youchao went to court yesterday (3rd) to request that Ms. Wu be summoned to court to legally prohibit the marriage and to determine guardianship of Yu Mei. A mediation hearing is scheduled for the 10th.</p>
<p>Pinghu: Pedestrian Killed by Car on Highway</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in Zhapu, incidents of pedestrians being injured or killed have occurred frequently. Two accidents occurred last month, both resulting in fatal injuries. On the afternoon of the 31st, Zhang Shouchun, residing on Hosiery Factory Street in the South City of Shanghai, was driving his private car with Shanghai license plate number 7362 when he struck and killed Bao Shunhe, a 66-year-old pedestrian, near Longwangtang in the Zhapu jurisdiction. The Second Public Security Sub-Bureau, upon learning of the incident, impounded the vehicle and telegraphed the county government for instructions. Yesterday, County Magistrate Zhang Zhouwen personally went to collect the body.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Agricultural Bank Prepares for Agricultural Warehouses</p>
<p>The Jiaxing County Local Farmers Bank, in order to regulate rural finance and increase the price of agricultural products to maintain farmers' livelihoods, plans to establish seven agricultural warehouses this year, one each in Xinsheng, Xinfeng, Wangdian, Wangjiangjing, Yuxian, and Youchegang. Preparations are currently underway to enable farmers to store various grains and miscellaneous grains in the warehouses and sell them when prices are favorable. Furthermore, Manager Shen Xian'en believes that the bank's operations have been significantly hampered by the past embezzlement and escape of former manager Wu Heshu, despite reorganization by the Construction Department and gradual recovery. Past loans amounted to 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, and efforts are being made to recover them to improve financial flexibility. The bank is also seeking loans from other banks to establish mortgage loans as soon as possible. With the early rice harvest approaching and rice prices declining daily, the agricultural warehouses in Wangdian and Yuxian will be established first to allow farmers to obtain mortgages.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Reconnaissance of the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway Completed</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council, following a telegram from Chairman Chiang instructing the Council to examine the proposal from Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, to extend the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Jiangxi province to Fuzhou in Fujian province, dispatched a reconnaissance team led by Wang Xiuqin in early June. The team traveled from Shangrao through Fujian, passing through Yanping and arriving in Fuzhou. The reconnaissance has now been completed, and the team returned to the province yesterday. According to reports, the entire line is over 300 kilometers long, traversing high mountains and steep ridges, making the project extremely difficult. The estimated construction cost is approximately 22.2 million yuan. A measurement cost budget will be prepared to conduct surveying, with funding to be provided by the Fujian Provincial Government, to facilitate construction.</p>
<p>The Autumn Incense Market in the City is Quiet</p>
<p>The autumn incense season in Hangzhou is upon us. The Provincial Highway Bureau has opened a special bus route from Hubin to Dongyue Temple to facilitate travel. However, due to the economic downturn and the collapse of the rural economy, the number of pilgrims is extremely small, resulting in reduced temple revenues and a quiet market. Business for shops is slow, and the Highway Bureau has reduced the frequency of special bus trips. Daily ticket revenue is only around one hundred yuan, less than half of last year's figure.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan: Locusts and Rice Borers Found in Cotton and Rice Fields</p>
<p>Cotton plants cultivated in the Xiaoshan East Township Improved Cotton Area have been found infested with "seed hopper nymphs" that feed exclusively on cotton leaves. In areas such as Changshantou and Yujiatan, most of the cotton leaves have been eaten. Early rice in sandy areas has also suffered significant damage from rice borers. While people are catching the pests, they cannot be eradicated entirely. Additionally, rice borers have been found feeding on rice in the inland rice patties, but a heavy rain on the 3rd, which lasted all day, raised the water level in the fields to half a foot, killing most of the rice-eating insects. Farmers were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Tragic News: Wife Murdered After Gambling Losses</p>
<p>In the Xinlin Village area of Xiaoshan East Township, a merchant named Zheng Jimin was addicted to gambling. In recent days, he repeatedly lost, totaling over 500 yuan. On the morning of the 3rd, he demanded jewelry and silverware from his wife, Ms. Wei. When she refused, he repeatedly stabbed her with a kitchen knife, inflicting five fatal wounds. Neighbors reported the incident to the local police, who then reported it to the county government for an autopsy. Zheng, realizing the enormity of his crime, fled alone towards the Nansha area.</p>
<p>"Correction": In yesterday's Ningbo correspondence, the "Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Financial Relief Measures" contained an error. The "Tongyang" in the phrase "Tongyang among smaller firms" should have been "Tongchun." We urgently correct this error.</p>

The 32nd plenary meeting of the Board of Trustees was held yesterday morning, discussing and approving major proposals submitted by the finance and education committees, including loans for the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Huai River Commission. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Finance Committee Resolves Various Proposals</p>
<p>The expanded finance meeting of the China-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees was held at 5:00 PM on July 26th at No. 6 The Bund, Shanghai, to discuss the loan issue for the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Attendees included Yan Deqing, Chen Qicai, Marshall, Zeng Rongpu, and others, with Zeng Rongpu chairing the meeting. The meeting discussed the Ministry of Railways' proposal to borrow 2.2 million yuan in Boxer Indemnity funds to address the urgent need for construction funds for the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. It was resolved that, after reviewing categories 3 and 5 of the loan agreement for the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, no further loans were available except for those already allocated and designated for the Public Debt Fund, and the 500,000 yuan approved at the 69th meeting of the expanded finance committee to be allocated in early August. The expanded finance committee suggested allocating 600,000 yuan monthly starting on September 10th from Category 4 loan funds.</p>

The Board of Trustees is advised to allocate half of the funds to Qinghai and half to Ningxia. However, this is a special situation and shall not be used as a precedent for any subsequent requests.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Delivered Farewell Address Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China-British Boxer Indemnity Committee selected 24 students to study in the UK this year. They were given a farewell tea party by Mr. Marcel, the Vice-Chairman of the Committee and President of the British Chamber of Commerce. Following a speech by Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the Board, Mayor Wu delivered the following address: "I am very honored to have the opportunity to attend the farewell party for this year's students going to study in the UK and to say a few words at this grand gathering. You must know that the difficulties China is currently facing are like what is described in ancient Chinese poems, 'A leaking house suffers from continuous rain, and a broken boat faces headwind.' These two lines of poetry not only symbolize China's current difficulties but also deserve to be a constant reminder for every patriotic Chinese. To resolve these difficulties, we must begin with the wisdom of the people, a unified will and action, patience, and prolonged effort. Your most important goal and mission in studying in the UK is to prepare to resolve these difficulties and build a new China. When our Chinese youth go abroad to study, their purpose is to learn from others' strengths and make up for our own weaknesses. Therefore, what we should study and research is not the prosperity of foreign countries today, but how foreign countries have become strong. China and the UK have a long history of friendly relations, and the UK has many things we can learn from. I hope that when you return to the country after completing your studies, you will not only make valuable contributions to the country and society but also enhance the intimacy of Sino-British relations. There are not many Chinese youth with the opportunity to be educated, and even fewer who can go abroad to study. We who have the opportunity to be educated, and especially those who have the opportunity to receive foreign education, should serve our compatriots who do not have the opportunity to be educated. Therefore, I often say to Chinese students, 'Now is the time to build houses, not to live in them; now is the time to cook food, not to eat it.' So, I cannot help but take this opportunity to express my hope that you will serve the country and society in the future, build houses for the people, and cook food for the people. Farewell, everyone, goodbye, everyone. I hope you will remember my sincere and earnest farewell words today, and work hard and cherish our difficult and struggling motherland."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Silk and Tea Exports Gradually Thrive; Tung Oil Shipments to America are Most Numerous <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The price of Chinese silk abroad has been steadily declining, leading foreign merchants to halt their operations. Although the government has encouraged exports and attempted to improve silkworm varieties, it has been unable to restore the industry to its former state. However, in recent months, European and American countries have begun to purchase Chinese silk again. Last month, French company postal ships transported a total of 1,500 to 1,600 bales of Chinese silk to Europe. British company postal ships also shipped over 900 bales, and Blue Funnel Line and Japanese postal companies also each shipped several hundred bales.</p>
<p>The largest shipment by a French postal ship, containing over 800 pieces, marks the largest amount of Chinese silk exported in recent years and suggests a revival in the foreign demand for Chinese silk. Shipments to America are also simultaneously improving. Last month, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. shipped over 500 pieces of Chinese silk to New York. The amount transported by the Ch'ang Hsing Company to Vancouver and then to America was roughly equal. As for Chinese tea, exports to Europe have slightly increased, with shipments primarily going to Kashmir. Recently, a Blue Funnel Line ship exported 1,200 tons of tea valued at 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Today, the British postal ship Kaiserieh departed for Europe with over 100 tons of tea. In America, tea exports remain sluggish, but there has been a large increase in tung oil shipments recently, with over 100,000 barrels already exported.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Hsu Shih-ying's English Talk: Flood Relief Matters - Continues to Visit Financial and Charitable Circles, Deciding to Hold a Joint Meeting to Plan Emergency Relief <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Hsu Shih-ying, Chairman of the National Government's Relief Commission, returned from inspecting the disaster areas in the Yangtze River provinces. For two days in Shanghai, he separately instructed Mayor Wu and financiers and philanthropists such as Chang Kung-ch'uan to discuss raising funds for flood relief. He has been extremely busy running around and appealing for millions of disaster victims. A reporter from the Hsin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Hsu at Renji Hall yesterday and was received for a detailed discussion of the negotiations of recent days. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Support from All Sectors</p>
<p>Mr. Hsu stated, "Since returning from inspecting the disaster areas in the Yangtze River, the lives of millions of disaster victims have been constantly on my mind. Yesterday and the day before, I visited Mayor Wu twice but did not meet him, as the Mayor was out on official business. According to his family, he will return in the evening, and I will contact him by telephone. In addition, I visited Chang Kung-ch'uan, Ch'ien Hsin-chih, Lin K'ang-hou, and others from the financial sector in Shanghai, as well as philanthropists Wang I-t'ing, Wen Lan-t'ing, Huang Chin-rong, Tu Yueh-sheng, and others. All have expressed unanimous support and generously donated. Therefore, there should be no difficulty in raising funds for relief in the future."</p>
<p>Holding a Meeting</p>
<p>"Now that this matter has the support of all sectors, it has been decided to hold a joint meeting of all sectors to discuss the progress of fundraising. The joint meeting is scheduled to be held this Thursday (August 8) at 4:00 PM at Renji Hall. The name will be the Shanghai Flood Relief Association for Various Provinces. Its organization and fundraising methods will be streamlined and implemented aggressively following the previous methods used by the Drought Relief Association, because although the number of disaster victims is very large, many are in danger of not making it to the next day. Therefore, this relief effort is urgent."</p>
<p>Inviting Mei to Perform</p>
<p>Mr. Hsu also stated, "The night before last, I accepted an invitation from Li Shih-tseng to attend a banquet at the World Academy for Mr. Mei Lanfang, who had returned with acclaim. At the banquet, I described in detail the severity of this year's flood and the suffering of the disaster victims. All the guests present unanimously supported the idea of inviting Mr. Mei to stay in Shanghai to advocate for millions of disaster victims and raise funds through performances. The performance period is set for one month. The start date and performance location have not yet been determined, but will likely wait until the New World's flood relief entertainment is over before setting a date to begin. Whether it will be at New World will be discussed and decided at that time."</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai on the Tenth</p>
<p>"As for inspecting the Yellow River flood areas, I have decided to depart from Shanghai on the tenth, taking a ship to Qingdao and then transferring to the disaster area. The duration is set for two weeks. If time is not sufficient, it will be extended temporarily. The joint meeting of the Relief Association will be held on the eighth and will likely be established. Therefore, leaving Shanghai on the tenth will mark a small break in my efforts for the relief effort. After inspecting the flood in the Yellow River area, I will return to Shanghai to continue working hard on the relief effort."</p>

The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. It is reported that the society began its second recruitment of members on the first of this month, and there has been a very enthusiastic response to join from various locations.</p>
<h3 id="e59">City Center - Railroad Fully Completed - Opening to Traffic Before the Opening of the National Games on October 10 <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency met with Xiao Wei-kuo, Director of the Two-Road Traffic Department, yesterday. According to him, the city government, in order to facilitate transportation in the city center, has jointly built a railroad in the city center with the Ministry of Railways, starting from the Kaochingmiao Station on Sung-Hu Road, along Sanmin Road to the intersection of Wusong Road, with a total length of over two kilometers. The construction cost is over 40,000 yuan and is being built by the Two-Road Bureau. Construction began in the spring of this year, involving 4,200 cubic meters of earthwork, the construction of two wooden bridges, and one station building and platform each. It is now fully completed and awaiting the Ministry of Railways' approval before officially opening to traffic. It is expected to be open for passenger traffic before the opening of the Sixth National Games on October 10.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Industrial and Commercial Credit Loans - Loan Committee Reviews and Approves - Rejections for Non-Compliance - Mortgage Loans Negotiated with Banks and Firms <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Since announcing the review of small credit loans on August 1, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee has been handling matters in accordance with the ten principles promulgated by the Ministry. As for mortgage loans, factories negotiate with banks and firms themselves. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Credit Loan - Review and Approval</p>
<p>Industrialists and businessmen have been enthusiastically obtaining application forms for small credit loans from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It is reported that the Loan Committee initially sent 3,000 application forms to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which have already been used up. The committee approved the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's two requests for additional forms yesterday and sent another 1,500 copies for distribution. However, there are not many who have submitted completed forms to the committee. It is reported that several of the applicants are not engaged in the production of national goods. According to the loan regulations, "loans are limited to factories manufacturing national goods, shops selling national goods, and those transporting national goods for export," so they fundamentally do not qualify for loans. In addition, several factories have applied for loans that are several times their own assets, which is inconsistent with the ninth principle of the ten loan principles promulgated by the Ministry, "the total amount of loans shall not exceed half of the factory's capital and public reserve." It is reported that the committee will reject such applications in accordance with the regulations and hopes that applicants will pay special attention to the regulations and the explanatory notes issued by the committee to facilitate the process. Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the Loan Committee, the committee will handle applications fairly in accordance with the regulations and procedures and submit them to the committee meeting for decision. Factories should formally apply to the committee in accordance with the procedures and do not need to seek help from individuals to save time.</p>
<p>Mortgage Loan - Negotiated Independently</p>
<p>After the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce approved inquiries from various industries regarding mortgage loans of 15 million yuan, it sent a letter to the Loan Review Committee urging inquiries. According to a reporter from the Hsin Sheng News Agency, according to Article 2 of the loan details, "the total amount of industrial and commercial mortgage loans is limited to 15 million yuan, which will be lent by banks and money shops themselves, but must be reported to the committee for review and national treasury certificates will be issued as the second guarantee for the loan in accordance with the loan amount." Therefore, these loans should be negotiated directly between factories and shops and banks and money shops. It is reported that several factories and shops have directly negotiated with banks and money shops. After negotiation, they will report to the committee for review and issuance of national treasury certificates.</p>

<p>The German Second New Transport Potsdam is the second of the three ships in the North German Lloyd's Central Europe Express service. The shipowner is Hapag-Lloyd, which was merged into North German Lloyd by order of the German government to facilitate unified management in business. Potsdam is also a specially built new ship, and its equipment and layout are all designed to suit the Far East route. Like the North German Lloyd's Scharnhorst, the ship has first class and economy class passenger seats. Since the route must pass through the tropics, special attention is paid to ventilation and heat resistance. Since its first voyage from Germany on July 5, the schedule has been delayed by ten days due to receptions and visits being held everywhere along the way. The Shanghai Melchers &amp; Co. received a telegram from the shipowner Olendorff yesterday stating that the ship will arrive in Shanghai on the seventeenth and will still dock at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf. The ship plans to invite visitors from all walks of life and will depart for Japan on the nineteenth. The ship is slightly smaller than the Scharnhorst, with a net tonnage of 17,518 tons, a length of 193 meters, a width of 22.5 meters, and the same speed as the Scharnhorst. Passenger seats to the Far East are full, and first class and economy class cabins from Shanghai to Europe have all been pre-purchased.</p>

However, the procedures will not take much time. The exact date of departure from Shanghai to Sichuan is difficult to determine for the time being. It has not yet been decided whether to fly to Nanjing. Ambassador Lojacono is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the tenth of this month to go to Beidaihe to escape the heat. Rumors that he will accompany the aircraft to Sichuan to hold a presentation ceremony are not true.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chu Min-yi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, returned to Shanghai from Qingdao a few days ago and took a train to Nanjing last night. Before leaving, he made the following statement to reporters: "Mr. Wang's illness has been improving since arriving in Qingdao due to the climate. The persistent heat that lasted for three weeks since the end of June subsided at the end of July, and the elimination of the gallbladder swelling began in early August and is gradually taking effect. He should be fully recovered by the end of this month. The German doctor Knoll is in charge of the treatment, and he recently flew to Qingdao for a diagnosis. I saw him when I visited Mr. Wang a few days ago. Rumors of indiscriminate medication are false. It is also untrue that Wang can see guests and give speeches to various groups. Since arriving in Qingdao, Wang has not left the building. Before the end of July, he was bedridden all day, and only recently has he been able to sit up."</p>
<h3 id="e65">Municipal Land Bureau - Reorganizing Shanghai Land - Clearing 75% of the City's Area - Developing Land Certificate Areas Covering One Hundred and Five Maps <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau has been actively carrying out the reorganization of land in Shanghai for several years. The information obtained from the bureau is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Clearing 75% of the Area</p>
<p>It has been over seventy years since land was cleared in Shanghai in the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855), and the boundaries of people's fields have not been accurate, and the boundaries of maps have been lost and difficult to verify. Moreover, the area of ​​Shanghai includes the former Baoshan and Shanghai counties, so the names of the maps are inconsistent. To facilitate organization and benefit the people, all the original bao tu wei numbers in the cleared areas will be abolished, and new divisions will be made based on natural boundaries, and map names will be compiled. Land certificates will be filled in accordingly in the future. Currently, the Zhenru, Wusong, Gaoqiao, Jiangwan, Yinhang, Pengpei, and six districts in the former Baoshan area have been cleared by the Baoshan Land Clearing Bureau. A part of Wusong Jiangwan belongs to the war zone and has been re-measured. A part of Yinhang District belongs to the city center area and has also been re-measured. Other areas such as Zhenru, Pengpu, and Gaoqiao have also been re-measured due to road construction and requisition. The seven districts of Hunan, Caojing, Fahua, Yinxiang, Yangsi, Zhabei, and Tangqiao have all been measured. Yangjing and Pusong are currently being measured. The total cleared area accounts for approximately 75% of the city.</p>
<p>Property Evidence Collected Uniformly</p>
<p>Shanghai is an industrial and commercial port, and the evidence of land ownership is extremely complicated. Therefore, the bureau has collected all the original property evidence and issued land occupation certificates. However, due to the different natures of the various documents, the certificate replacement procedures are also slightly different. In the cleared area, each household's map will be drawn first, the area calculated, and the plot number assigned. The bureau will then announce the certificate replacement and order the people to bring various documents and grain certificates for the past three years to the bureau within the specified time to identify the single map. After signing and recognizing, the certificate will be issued. Each certificate will be attached with a map, and the terrain and four addresses, as well as the location of the land and the location of the entire area, will be clear at a glance. The number of acres is accurate, and the evidence is unique, so the land certificate is the only proof of property rights in the city. There are now one hundred and five areas that have been measured and developed for land certificates, and approximately 110,000 certificates have been issued.</p>
<p>The Riverbank Base Will No Longer Be Used</p>
<p>Land prices in Shanghai are expensive, so if ownerless land is discovered during the clearing, or if people report the encroachment of public land, it will be taken over by the city after verification. The land taken over can be requested for sale, or it can be leased to the people to avoid waste and benefit the income. As for the old riverbank base, it is stipulated that all those with a length of more than 500 meters and a width of more than one meter are public riverbanks, and those that do not meet the above regulations but are indicated in the deeds held by the owners are private riverbanks. This public riverbank was indeed needed in the past, but the current situation has changed, and fields have become thoroughfares. The old riverbank base will no longer be used and can be taxed by the owners on both sides. If the owners on both sides give up their rights, it can be taxed by a third party. There are also extra land surcharges and beach surcharges.</p>

<p>After 71 overseas Chinese who were expelled from Japan returned to China on the China Revival Company's Hua Wu ship, they were temporarily staying at the Jiangxi Guild Hall. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent representatives to comfort them after hearing the news. The overseas Chinese sent representatives to the Municipal Government yesterday to petition for relief to maintain their lives. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Petitioned Yesterday, the overseas Chinese elected Hu Junmin as their representative and brought a letter from the Tokyo Direct Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang to petition the Municipal Government for relief to maintain their livelihoods. The Municipal Government sent Liu Xunru to meet them and provide comfort, promising to convey the situation and send personnel to investigate and provide relief. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Three More Arrived According to a reporter from the Industrial News Agency, three overseas Chinese, Chen Feijin, Zhang Guoliang, and Lin Yandie, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Tokyo on the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Aso Maru. They are currently staying at the Yuelai Hotel on the 16th Wharf. A total of 74 people have been forced to return to their home countries in three days. They are on the verge of starvation and urgently hope for relief from the authorities.</p>

<p>The 18 silk factories in Zhabei suddenly experienced a strike on the morning of the third, causing all 18 silk factories to be shut down. Party and government agencies paid close attention to this matter and sent personnel to investigate in detail. The Silk Industry Association convened a meeting at the association hall the day before yesterday and decided to listen to the handling of the matter by the party and government authorities. Yesterday, the 10 silk factories north of the railway were restored to work, while the railway factories remained shut down. Yesterday morning, the chairman of the association, Shen Huachen, went to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs to ask for guidance. Party and government agencies believed that the matter should be resolved quickly and ordered the factories to open today and notified the workers of all factories to resume work, while notifying the local military and police agencies to protect them, so it is expected that all factories will resume work today.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Representatives of Hubei Native Place Association Discuss Relief Methods with Hsu Shih-ying <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Hubei Native Place Association established a Flood Relief Association the day before yesterday. Chairman Han Juemin reported on the preparations for the Flood Relief Association. It was generally believed that the disaster area in Hubei this time was as wide as 51 counties, with hundreds of thousands of disaster victims and a large number of people drowned. The loss of cotton, grain, and miscellaneous grains was approximately 200 million yuan. The disaster was serious and unprecedented. Chairman Hsu Jingren of the Accounting Committee was asked to investigate despite the summer heat and did not hesitate to work hard. As a senior citizen of venerable age, he traveled thousands of miles, traced up the Jingjiang River and down the Xiangjiang River, and personally oversaw the situation. This attention to the disaster area was unprecedented and was a savior for the people of Hubei and a lucky star for Jianghan. It was resolved that Tang Zhuxin, Yin Guanzhi, Han Juemin, Liu Wanqing (replaced by Peng Yuncen), and Lu Xingjie would be publicly elected as representatives to thank Chairman Hsu and ask about the impressions of the disaster area and the current and future relief methods. Chairman Hsu replied, "The Jingjiang and Xiangjiang rivers are connected by the sky and water, and it is difficult to distinguish north from south. Except for the treetops, the parapets, and the roofs, it is a vast expanse of water. The tragedy is heartbreaking and indescribable. Three methods have been proposed for post-disaster relief: emergency relief, agricultural relief, and industrial relief. The funding for emergency relief belongs to the local government and is for setting up porridge kitchens, building shacks, selling cheap grain to relieve hunger, and providing medicine to prevent epidemics. The funding for agricultural relief belongs to the provincial government and is for distributing seeds, replenishing agricultural implements, and opening farmers' banks for lending. The funding for industrial relief belongs to the national government and is for dredging waterways and building trunk dams and people's dams. Emergency relief and agricultural relief are the standard for water management, and industrial relief is the basis for negotiating water. They will be carried out in order to save the natural disaster in the future." The representatives believed that what Chairman Hsu said was a good plan for saving lives and was a permanent solution, with good laws and intentions, and the same contribution as Yu and Ji. They hoped that he would preside over the implementation and save the common people, and thanked the 30 million people of Hubei. The chairman replied, "I will do my best and exhaust my strength." The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Sino-Foreign Relief Association - Continued Reports of Disaster Situations in Various Places <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road received many letters and telegrams from various places requesting relief for flood disasters yesterday. They are summarized as follows, hoping that philanthropists at home and abroad will act with compassion and generosity to help the survivors of the disaster avoid sinking into misery: (1) Yuan'an, Hubei: The county currently has more than 20,000 people waiting for assistance, unable to live or die. The sound of fathers and mothers crying for their children and the groans of starvation can be heard everywhere, and suicides by hanging and drowning are common sights. (2) Jingsha: (omitted) Jingsha was struck by a natural disaster, with floods overflowing, and hundreds of thousands of lives were in ruins, half buried in the bellies of fish and half as mourning wild geese. At present, the disaster victims should be gathered, waiting to be fed. Although Shabu is a rice-producing area, it is now a time of scarcity, with rice reserves exhausted and sources cut off. If this continues, they will all perish. (3) Shishou: Historically remote and barren, located in the lower reaches of the Jingjiang River, statistics show that 80% of the county was flooded, with more than 5,000 people drowned, more than 400,000 mu of farmland submerged, and more than 30 million yuan of property lost. Since 1927, Shishou has suffered from successive soldiers and bandits, as well as the great flood of 1931 and the severe drought of 1934. This year, it has suffered this tragedy again. There is not only no empty house, but also no field of green grass. Children cry and women wail, with no way to find food. (4) Sheng Lu, Anhui: Since the summer, the river tide has risen sharply and mountain floods have broken out. The Yonggu, Tianbao, Dacheng, Sucun, Yongfeng, and Lotus weirs, as well as the various dikes along the river, have been tragically destroyed one after another. Livestock have been swept away, and houses have been destroyed. Tens of thousands of people have suffered the same catastrophe, eating grass and sleeping in the open, and the sound of lamentation is unbearable to hear. The county suffered from drought last year, and the livelihoods of farmers were already unsustainable. Now, the houses and crops have been swallowed by the flood. Food and shelter are not available, and they are repeatedly devastated. The state of hunger and separation is extremely miserable. What is the crime of the people, to suffer this disaster? (5) Shimen, Hunan: The current flood has stretched for about 400 miles and is about 100 miles wide. About 5,600 houses have been destroyed, nearly 200,000 mu of farmland have been destroyed, and about 10,000 people have been drowned. The severity of the disaster is even greater than that of Tianmen and Xiangyang counties in Hubei. About 60,000 to 70,000 people are in urgent need of relief.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Office of the Chief of the Aviation Association Headquarters: Held the 23rd Office Affairs Meeting <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The office of the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Team of the China Aviation Association convened its 23rd office affairs meeting at 3:00 PM on the 3rd at the office. They discussed all matters related to the fundraising campaign. Attendees included: Chief Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Chen Shuo, Li Jimin, Liu Songtao, Lu Zhangyan, Wei Jianxin, Zhang Xiamin, Li Wenyao, Bao Lengxue, Zhu Shengyang, Xue Baolun, etc. The meeting was chaired by Chief Secretary Li, with Chen Shuo as the recorder. The chairman reported that various fundraising teams were actively proceeding, successively submitting membership fees and donations. The office considered fundraising a major undertaking, relying on collective efforts to succeed. Therefore, they continued to hire enthusiastic and capable individuals to serve as team leaders, deputy team leaders, and team members to conduct activities separately. Regarding fundraising, the hotel industry's donation collection for June had already been settled and announced. Due to the hot weather and slow business, the results were less impressive. However, the hotels were commended for their diligent efforts and the enthusiastic contributions of travelers. Staff responsible for inspecting the industry should intensify their efforts to assist and supervise them at all times, so that they may improve daily and complete the fundraising mission as soon as possible. The collection of donations from the brick and tile transportation industry was proceeding smoothly after its commencement. However, some vehicle owners had not yet paid their donations. After dispatching personnel for persuasion and requesting assistance from the police stations of the Public Security Bureau for advice, most had complied and made supplementary payments. For those who had not paid, the association should conduct a thorough investigation, compile a list, and promptly recover the funds to facilitate progress. As for the collection of donations from the sand and gravel industry, the trade association had approved the collection of 100,000 yuan. The office formulated collection methods and submitted them to the municipal government for approval and filing, which had already been communicated. It was decided that collection would begin on August 20th. The Liangjiang Swimming Pool was organizing an aviation swimming competition, scheduled to be held on the 10th of this month at the pool on Xiangyin Road. Ticket sales were entrusted to the YMCA and public sports fields, and purchases had been very enthusiastic in recent days. Additionally, Team 74 leader Zhang Shichuan and Team 320 leader Hu Die proposed holding an aviation entertainment event, scheduled to be held on the 17th of this month at the Lyceum Theatre. They invited performers and the entire female cast of a star company, known for their reputation at sea, to participate in the performance, with the proceeds going towards fundraising. The chairman hoped that the secretaries would work hard to assist in the process. Subsequently, after the external secretaries reported on their work, various cases related to the fundraising plan were discussed until the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>

<p>The Cotton Control Association of the National Economic Council, due to the impact of the Yellow River floods on cotton production in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces this year, had previously received reports from its affiliated cotton improvement institutes regarding the damage. To gain a clearer understanding, it specially dispatched Zou Bingwen, a standing committee member of the association, to conduct an on-site inspection. Zou departed yesterday and plans to first visit various parts of Shandong Province before proceeding to Hebei. The trip is scheduled for two weeks. If time permits, he also intends to travel south along the Pinghan Railway to investigate the situation in Henan Province. According to the person in charge of the association, among the cotton fields affected by the disaster in various provinces of North China this year, Shandong suffered the most severe losses, followed by Hebei and Henan, while the situation in Shaanxi was the best. The actual situation will be reliably reported after Zou's inspection.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government has received instructions from the Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, roughly stating: the tax rate for land and property deeds has been reduced to 6.3%, and the original surcharges must not exceed half of the regular tax. The deadline for this extension was the end of July this year. However, as it is currently the lean season and the social economy is in difficulty, many white deeds have not been taxed in time. If the extension and reduction are not considered, it will inevitably lead to a wait-and-see attitude, which is not conducive to increasing tax revenue and benefiting the people. Now, starting from August, the extension will be extended for another three months, until the end of October. The original surcharges are still not allowed to exceed half of the 6.3% tax rate. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Ye issued a notice to the public yesterday to inform them. The continuation of the extension and reduction this time is intended to show consideration for the people's livelihood. It is imperative to take advantage of this extension period to pay taxes on all untaxed deeds, and there should be no further delays.</p>
<h3 id="e74">After Yu Qiaqing Resigned, the Work of the Shipping Cooperative Was Suspended; Authorities Still Hope for Continued Active Progress <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The specific plan for China's shipping cooperation, formulated by the China Shipping Cooperation Design Committee after six months of research, has been promulgated by the Ministry of Communications and the board of directors of the China Shipping Cooperative has been established. Subsequently, due to obstacles, Executive Director Yu Qiaqing resigned in anger, resulting in a suspension of work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Work Suspended After Yu's Resignation: After the establishment of the board of directors of the cooperative, it planned to establish (1) a Joint Business Office for Yangtze River Steamers, under which all regular liners operating on the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Shanghai-Ningbo line would be affiliated; (2) a Joint Business Office for Coastal Steamers, under which all regular liners and non-regular liners operating to ports in the North and South Seas and non-regular liners operating on the Yangtze River would be affiliated; (3) a Business Office for Port Steamers, under which all regular liners operating to ports not designated as treaty ports would be affiliated. For several months now, due to practical obstacles, it has been impossible to implement. Executive Director Yu Qiaqing resigned in anger, resulting in a suspension of the cooperative's work.</p>
<p>Various Companies Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude; Cooperation Difficult: The reason for the suspension of shipping cooperation is that state-owned and private shipping companies cannot effectively cooperate. For example, each company, due to local historical route relationships and slightly different business practices, is unwilling to share all of its special interests with the public. At the same time, they are deeply afraid that the cooperative will be controlled by a small number of people. After its implementation, the original personnel of each company will inevitably be eliminated. Therefore, various companies have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and some parties have intentionally delayed, making it impossible to implement in practice. However, in order to plan for shipping cooperation, the authorities hope for continued active progress in order to achieve the goal.</p>

<p>Since the labor unions of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways were ordered to cease activities by the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways in December of last year, Chen Junpei, Zhang Yunhe, and others were appointed as instructors, and Xue Jie, Luo Lairong, Pan Xiangqin, Hong Desheng, and Yuan Qiaofu were appointed as reorganizers to establish a reorganization office and immediately begin work.

<p>Since Du Yuesheng accepted the request of the rickshaw merchants, he visited the Police Department of the Municipal Council yesterday morning to mediate the registration of rickshaw drivers. As a result of the discussion, the French Concession authorities agreed to submit the registration fee to the Board of Directors for discussion. The remaining registration matters cannot be changed and must be implemented. It was stated that if the rickshaw drivers do not register, their vehicles will be detained and difficult to release. Therefore, the situation has reached a breaking point. Yesterday, the French police continued to arrest vehicles. The rickshaw drivers in the area held a meeting at the South Wharf at 6:00 PM yesterday, attended by more than 200 representatives. Chaired by Shi Changsheng, it was decided: (1) to keep the discussions confidential; (2) to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau for relief tomorrow (today); (3) to send representatives to the Chinese Directors of the Police Department of the French Municipal Council and the Chinese United Association of Citizens to expand the petition; (4) to request the rickshaw owners and the guild, as well as the rickshaw owners and drivers in the British Concession, Zhabei, and West Shanghai, to provide assistance; (5) to issue a declaration and a letter to all sectors of society. Because the rickshaw drivers knew that the negotiations were ineffective, they beat and injured Zhang Huaiyang and Qiu Changshan, the executive committee members of the guild, at 7:00 PM last night. The Police Committee of the Public Security Bureau sent police to stop them and sent the two injured men to the hospital for treatment by car.</p>
<p>Special News: The case has not opened up a new situation as of midnight yesterday. Therefore, all rickshaws in the French Concession will be completely shut down today.</p>

<p>The National Goods World and the Water Disaster Propaganda Meeting of the Citizens' Association were held simultaneously yesterday. Attendees included: Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo (represented by He Bingxian), He Bingxian of the International Trade Bureau, Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Chinese Taxpayers Association, Cheng Xiesheng of the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association, Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association, and representatives from all walks of life, Yuan Ludeng, Ye Jiayu, Liu Zhongying, Chen Jiufeng, Ge Futian, Zheng Dongshan, Hu Die, and others, totaling more than 500 people. He Bingxian, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Xu Xiaochu served as the presidium. After performing the rituals, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, saying, "Today, the National Goods World is opening here, and we are honored to have guests from all walks of life come from afar. At this time of severe national crisis, the only way to save the nation and survive is for the people of the whole country to uniformly use national goods to consolidate the national foundation. Only then can the country and the people become strong." Then, He Bingxian gave a speech, saying, "The National Goods World is intended to promote national goods and enable domestic production to supply the market. Therefore, we have collected rare national products from the market and displayed them for purchase." Yuan Ludeng and Cheng Xiesheng also gave speeches, which will not be recorded due to their length.</p>
<p>Opening Declaration</p>
<p>The opening declaration of the world stated, "Military aggression is certainly enough to destroy a country, but economic aggression is also enough to destroy a country and exterminate a race. Our country, under the economic aggression of the great powers, is also encountering floods and droughts, which have led to rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial collapse, and a general state of depression in all aspects of society. To save the country from such a national crisis, in addition to using customs policies to curb foreign economic aggression, we must also cultivate the psychology of the people of the country to love and use national goods, so that national goods can be sold vigorously in the market. After blocking the loopholes, we can talk about all other national salvation policies. Shanghai is the largest port in China, with a population of 3.5 million, holding the hub of national culture and economy. Its every move is enough to make the whole country follow suit. Our world is based on this principle, uniting more than 100 famous national goods factories to sell exquisite daily-use national goods, serving as a medium between production and consumption, in order to achieve equal supply between production and consumption, so that industry and commerce can be revived and finance can become stable. We hope that wise men and pioneers of national goods at home and abroad will work together to achieve this. We hereby declare."</p>
<p>Unveiling and Ribbon-Cutting</p>
<p>After the opening of the world, the presidium accompanied He Bingxian and Hu Die to unveil and cut the ribbon. First, Mr. He unveiled the cloth covering the main entrance. Then, Hu Die held silver scissors and cut the ribbon. The crowd then poured in, and the business section opened for business. The presidium and Mr. He and Hu also visited the Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the Chinese and Western Pharmacy, and other participating manufacturers in turn.</p>
<p>Water Disaster Propaganda</p>
<p>Then, the Water Disaster Propaganda Meeting was opened, with Wang Xiaolai, Hu Fengxiang, and Lin Kanghou as the presidium. After performing the rituals, Hu Fengxiang first reported, "The Citizens' Association, in view of the floods in more than a dozen provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Anhui this year, the victims are displaced and have no food or clothing. It is truly a scene of misery everywhere. Therefore, we are holding this Water Disaster Propaganda Meeting to enable the ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai to slightly reduce their dance and music activities and save these disaster victims." Then, Qiu Liangyu gave a speech, saying, "The national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, and we are also suffering from this natural disaster. 30 million compatriots in the disaster-stricken areas are crying for food and shivering with cold, and they cannot live through the day. Because Shanghai has not suffered this catastrophe, the general public is still indulging in extravagance and singing and dancing all night long. It is truly what is called 'A merchant girl does not know the hatred of national subjugation, and still sings the backyard flower across the river.' It is truly sighing. Although the government is taking measures to provide relief to the disaster areas and the victims, the date of implementation is still uncertain. The Citizens' Association has initiated propaganda for this purpose, hoping that all sectors will donate generously."</p>

After being brought to the case, they confessed that there were a total of ten principal offenders in the case. The main offender was He Jichang (nicknamed "Little Shandong"). After He</p>
<p>Robbed the Silver and Pistols, he hid them in Zhang Yansheng's house, paying Zhang ten yuan. Shi Arong was the offender who seized the police pistol during the robbery. Xu Axiang was the thief who pretended to push a bamboo cart. Bu Jinyuan was the one who provided the lead for the case. Wang Kaifu was the one who drove the car. The remaining Lu Jinfu, Lu Jintao, Li Dean, and Zhang Chuanhu jointly robbed the money and seized the Bank of Communications guard's pistol.

<p>The Great American Evening News reported that Dr. Calent, an American surgical bone specialist from Los Angeles, arrived in Shanghai with his son on Sunday and plans to stay for a week. Dr. Calent's bone-setting skills are very famous in the United States. He can transfer bones from other parts of the patient's body to the fractured area. He has long heard that China has special methods of bone-setting, so he came here specifically to visit famous experts, hoping to learn their secrets. However, there are very few Chinese medical books on bone-setting, and the techniques are mostly passed down orally from teachers to students, so it is feared that his wishes will be difficult to fulfill.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Assistant Manager of Tongqing Qianzhuang Embezzled a Large Sum of Money; Case Postponed for Rehearing Yesterday Due to Police Holiday <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Tongqing Qianzhuang at No. 280 Ningbo Road is a financial giant opened by partners. They hired Xia Guichu from Ningbo as the manager and Zhu Haichu from Huzhou as the assistant manager. Since its opening in the spring of 1934, it has been operating for only a little over a year and has suffered heavy losses. Each share of capital was originally 30,000 yuan, but now it needs to be increased tenfold, for a total of 300,000 yuan per share. After the shareholders investigated the accounts, they discovered major malpractices. It was found that Xia and Zhu, the two managers, colluded in fraudulent activities and embezzled 534,393.23 yuan of public funds. They hired lawyer E Sen to report to the General Inspectorate of Police, ordering detectives to arrest Xia and Zhu and hand them over to the First Special District Court for trial. The court ordered Xia to be remanded in custody and Zhu to be allowed to post bail of 100,000 yuan in cash or collateral in the form of stores, as detailed in this newspaper. This case was originally scheduled to be continued for trial in the First Criminal Court by Judge Feng Shide of the First Special Court yesterday morning, but it happened to be a holiday for the Municipal Council, and the police suspended the transfer of cases. This case was also prosecuted by the police, so it could not proceed and was declared postponed for rehearing.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Complex Case of a Woman's Corpse Retrieved from the Huangpu River: Three Laborers Describe Witnessing the Victim's Murder; Another Girl Also Thrown into the Huangpu River Simultaneously <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>On the third of this month, at 2 PM, as the Beiyang-class Shengjing ship berthed at Pier No. 3 of the Taikoo Dock in the French Concession was raising anchor to leave the port, its propeller's rotation suddenly churned up an unidentified female corpse. The lower body was naked, and medical examination revealed signs of redness, suggesting a possible murder. However, valuable jewelry and over one hundred yuan in banknotes from various banks that she carried were not taken. After the corpse was retrieved by the Customs Water Police, detectives were dispatched to investigate this suspicious case, details of which were reported in this newspaper previously. After the occurrence of this case, the day before yesterday evening, an elderly woman from Suzhou, Zhang Zhou Shi, along with her daughter-in-law, Zhang Li Shi, went to the South City Rescue Bureau claiming that after reading the newspaper today, the description of the deceased strongly resembled their niece. The bureau then had the corpse brought out, and Zhang Zhou Shi positively identified her without mistake. That evening, they reported to the Customs Water Police requesting the arrest and prosecution of the murderer. They provided a detailed account of the deceased's life, stating that the deceased was named Zhang Jinlin, 48 years old, from Suzhou. When she was 29, her first husband passed away from illness. Later, she became involved with a Shandong man named Mou Jia, leading to disdain from her in-laws and uncles. She then followed Jia to Shandong and opened a silk shop in Kaifeng Prefecture, which gradually prospered and became quite profitable. The deceased once brought two thousand yuan to Shanghai, deposited it in a comb shop in this port, obtained a deposit book, and collected interest annually. She now has a ten-year-old daughter in Shandong. Recently, the deceased came to Shanghai alone, withdrew two hundred and sixty yuan in interest from the shop, and then engaged in an affair in Shanghai, forgetting to return to Shandong. She and her lover bought utensils and planned to rent a house to live together. Recently, she suddenly did not return for two nights, and unexpectedly, she died in the Huangpu River. After receiving the report, the police department intensified its investigation. Yesterday morning, they brought in three dockworkers from the Taikoo Dock, Hao Zhongyang, Zhuang Changshou, and Qi Jinbao, who claimed to have witnessed the victim's murder. They all stated that at around 11 PM on the second of this month, they were cooling off on Taikoo Pier No. 3 when two men and a woman suddenly appeared with a six- or seven-year-old girl to stroll around the pier. After wandering around on the Shengjing ship for a week, they returned to the pier. Then, they saw one of the men angrily scold the woman and use a wooden stick in his hand to hold her down and strike her head violently. The woman pleaded in vain, and then another man instructed the woman to take out dozens of yuan to settle the matter, but the assailant refused, insisting that unless the woman was killed, his own safety would not be guaranteed. After arguing until midnight, they forced the woman to take off her Xiangyun silk pants and, taking the opportunity, violently pushed her into the Huangpu River. The six- or seven-year-old girl wanted to cry for help but was also thrown into the river by the man. Both of them did not resurface. The three of them intended to use bamboo poles to rescue them, but the assailant pointed a pistol at them, making it impossible to save them, and they watched the two men flee. After obtaining these statements, the police department deemed the case complex. The reason for the woman's murder and the identity of the girl who was killed at the same time were still difficult to find clues for. In addition to sending the three witnesses to the local court for questioning first, at 11 AM, they sent personnel to report to the court, requesting an official to examine the corpse, ordering the family members of the deceased to prepare a coffin for burial, and waiting for the arrest and prosecution of the murderer.</p>

<p>Li Jining from Hangzhou, 36 years old, residing at No. 3, Mingyue Lane, Qiwupu Road, has been working as a deputy foreman at the Zhonghua No. 1 Knitting Factory on Longjiang Road, Yangshupu. Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, while Li was still working in the factory, he suddenly received a phone call from outside the factory, claiming that his brother, Li Jishou, had been hit by a Southern automobile near Dongxin Bridge and that the injured person had been sent to the Southern Automobile Head Office at the intersection of Xihua De Road and Huade Road, waiting for Li Jining to negotiate compensation for medical expenses. Upon receiving this news, Li Jining, deeply concerned for his brother, became extremely anxious and went with the factory's head foreman, Wu Donglin. However, both Li and Wu were unfamiliar with the route, so upon arriving near Zhuangyuan Mansion, they became lost and immediately asked a man in short clothes at the entrance of the lane for directions. The man also claimed not to know and told them to inquire with another man in short clothes at the entrance of the lane ahead. Li and Wu, without suspecting anything, followed the instructions. Upon reaching the location, the man in short clothes immediately pulled out an iron rod from behind him and violently struck Li and Wu. Li Jining and Wu Donglin, caught off guard, were struck one after the other and fell to the ground, screaming for help. Nearby patrol officers, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene, but the assailant had already fled. They then transported the two to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Li Jining's leg was the most severely injured, with his foot bone having been broken. Wu Donglin was also injured in the leg. As for the incident of Li's brother, Li Jishou, being hit by a car, after police investigation, it turned out to be completely fabricated. The victims also did not recognize the assailant's face. According to bystanders, it was speculated that someone who had a grudge against Li had devised a plan to retaliate by falsely reporting an accident, luring him out, and carrying out this vicious act. The police are currently pursuing the matter.</p>

<p>Western officers from the Sanitation Department of the French Municipal Council, in view of the fact that in recent years, the stalls selling re-rolled cigarettes along various roadsides were all set up by impoverished and idle people who specialize in collecting leftover cigarette butts picked up from the roads or garbage dumps, taking them apart and re-rolling them to sell to others, which seriously hinders public health and abnormally crowded the roadsides, especially notified the French police to crack down and arrest them. On the 3rd, the French police dispatched detectives to investigate and arrest them in all directions. From 9:00 AM to 11:15 AM, within two hours, in places such as Xujiahui Road, Kangdi Road, Mofang Street, and Maidian Road, they successively arrested Sun Zhiqing (40 years old, from Xinghua), Zhang Rongyao (45 years old, from Yangzhou), Chen Songwu (31 years old, from Nanxiang), Su Diancheng (47 years old, from Shandong), Xiao Yangzhou (35 years old, from Anhui), Wang Yongfu (45 years old, from Yangzhou), Jia Tianchen (18 years old, from Yangzhou), Zhang Shao (56 years old, from Qingjiang), Ai Wangshi (33 years old, from Gaoyou), Zhang A'e (29 years old, from Hangzhou), Kong Zhenlin (58 years old, from Hangzhou), Chen Quanyuan (20 years old, from Suzhou), Li Rongsheng (40 years old, from Suzhou), Qian Jinda (22 years old, from Wuxi), Li Genquan (47 years old, from Suzhou), Chen Er (26 years old, from Jiangbei), Sun Daguniang (60 years old, from Liyang), Li Yushi (70 years old, from Suzhou), Wu Meitang (39 years old, from Ningbo), a total of nineteen men and women, seizing nineteen sets of cigarette stalls, totaling more than twenty catties of finished cigarettes and unrolled cigarette shreds and un拆烟头, as well as the tools used for re-rolling, all of which were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the 8th Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court, where Judge Qiu Huan Ying presided over the hearing. Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer from the police department, explained the case and filed a lawsuit based on Article 191 of the new criminal law for the public danger crime of endangering public health, and presented the evidence to the court. After the court questioned the defendants one by one, they immediately ruled that Xiao Yangzhou, Kong Zhenlin, Sun Daguniang, and Li Yushi were innocent. The remaining defendants were each fined one yuan, and if they were to perform labor service, one yuan would be deducted for one day. The rolled cigarettes and other items seized in the case were confiscated and burned.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Lost Eight Yuan, Committed Suicide at Home with a Knife; Borrowed Money from Relatives to Treat Illness; A Tragedy Occurred After the Money Was Stolen <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Chen Huabao, a 26-year-old farmer from Caohujiazhai Village, Paotai Bay, Wusong, made a living by farming. His parents passed away early, and he married Shen Shi, who was of similar age. They had two sons and one daughter, all of whom were young children. Huabao had been suffering from tuberculosis for many years, which led to poverty in the family. Recently, his old illness recurred. The day before yesterday, he borrowed ten yuan from relatives to treat his illness. This morning, he went to Songzhen to buy vegetables, spending two yuan. The remaining eight yuan was placed in his pocket, intending to see a doctor in the afternoon to treat his illness. However, he was pickpocketed at the vegetable market, and the thief stole the money. When Chen realized that the money was stolen and tried to investigate, the thief had already disappeared. He returned home with tears in his eyes and cried loudly. The neighbors all knew that he had been robbed, but they did not expect that there would be an accident. Unexpectedly, after crying, Chen thought to himself, "I am already plagued by illness, and I hate the ruthlessness of the thief." In anger and resentment, he conceived a world-weary thought and took advantage of the fact that his wife and others were working in the fields, and committed suicide with a sharp knife in the house, stabbing himself seven times all over his body. He immediately fell dead on the bed. At noon, his wife, Shen Shi, returned home for lunch and, not seeing her husband's face, went to the room and saw her husband lying face up in a pool of blood. She called out to him, but he did not respond. In panic, she rushed out and called the neighbors, and went back to look closely and saw that Huabao's whole body was covered in blood and his breath had been cut off for a long time. At this point, Shen Shi realized that her husband had committed this tragic murder due to the stolen silver. Although she was heartbroken, she had no one to raise her children. She could only prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Huang Shengda Dies Tragically after Being Slashed by an Enemy; Suspect Song Guanlong Arrested; Bloody Axe Found <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Huang Shengda, 36 years old, from Changzhou, had been running a round wood shop at No. 98, Fuling Road, and also contracted to make wooden barrels in the Chinese Nail Factory at No. 85 on the same road, so business was not bad. It was recorded that at around 3 AM the day before yesterday, Huang and his wife, Zhang Shi, were sleeping on the floor in front of the shop when someone broke in and slashed Huang's right temple with an axe before escaping. Huang's screams for help woke Zhang Shi and others, who saw that her husband's head was already bleeding profusely, but the murderer was nowhere to be found. They immediately went out to report to the Chinese police and called for an ambulance by telephone, which rushed him to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. After being informed, the Yulin Road police station dispatched detective Jin Wanrong to the hospital to investigate. Huang stated that he did not see the murderer's face when he was slashed, so he did not know who it was, but he had never had any feud with anyone. Only Song Guanlong (currently residing at No. 8, Beijie, Yinxiang Port) in the same industry had previously contracted the wooden barrels of the nail factory together, but recently Song had been dismissed by the factory, so all the wooden barrels were made exclusively by Huang. Therefore, this assassination was likely committed by him. After hearing the statement, the detective immediately went to the address and arrested Song, and found an axe with blood stains at the scene. He was brought to the police station together and prepared to be sent to the court for detention and investigation today (the 6th). The axe was also sent to the Municipal Council's chemical testing office to test the blood stains. Huang died in the hospital due to the severity of his injuries, and the treatment was ineffective. He passed away at 3:15 PM the day before yesterday. The body was transported to the Felun Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor from the Special No. 1 Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and secretary Wang Zuyi, came to the station to examine the body. According to the report from Western police chief Beikesi, Song Guanlong, 43 years old, from Chuansha, who runs a round wood business, denied having any feud with the deceased and also denied slashing him with an axe. The rest of the statement was inconsistent. Huang Zhangshi, the wife of the deceased, stated that although she was sleeping with her husband at the time, she did not see who the murderer was and requested an investigation. After receiving the statement, Guo Jun issued a statement that the deceased, Huang Shengda, male, was indeed killed by a sharp instrument during his lifetime, and the suspect Song Guanlong was handed over to the police station for investigation before being sent to the court for verification. The body was handed over to his wife, Huang Zhangshi, for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>

<p>Around 5 PM the other day, a foreigner (nationality unknown), Watterson (transliteration), was driving his private car with Municipal License No. 8142, traveling west from Minquan Road and Dongxin Kaihe at a very high speed. When passing the entrance of No. 395, West Head, Yuanlong Lane, he did not honk the horn and knocked the elderly Wu Jinbao (61 years old, from Anhui, residing at No. 24, Xicheng Lane, French Concession), who was traveling from the French Concession to the Chinese-controlled Hengchuan Road, into the tram tracks, causing severe injuries.

<p>Hou Bosheng, a villager from Caigenglang Wangjiaku, Hongqiao, West Shanghai, married Xu Caibao, the younger sister of Zhu Zhang Xiuying, a woman from Pinghu, as his wife through a matchmaker on the sixth day of the first lunar month this year. He paid 180 yuan as a tea gift, and they immediately married. Unexpectedly, after half a year, Xu Mingsheng, a man from Pinghu, reported to the Beixin Jing Police Station that his cousin Xu Caibao had been designed and enticed to be sold by Zhu Zhang Xiuying, requesting detention and investigation. Following instructions, the police dispatched officers to detain Zhu Zhang Xiuying, Hou Bosheng, Xu Caibao, and others and send them to the local court. After investigation by Prosecutor Zhang Zi, he ruled that Xu Caibao be taken back by Xu Mingsheng, Zhu Zhang Xiuying be detained, and Hou Bosheng be released on bail, and filed a lawsuit with the criminal court. Yesterday, Judge Wu Deying specially opened the 12th court to hear the case. First, the plaintiff Xu Mingsheng testified about the previous situation, requesting legal action. When questioned, Zhu Zhang Xiuying, 26 years old, admitted that she was a matchmaker, but denied enticing Caibao, and the rest of her statement was evasive. Hou Bosheng testified that he was 25 years old and that Chen Quantang's wife came to him as a matchmaker on the third day of the first lunar month, talking about Zhu Zhang Xiuying, who opened a teahouse a short distance from my house, having a younger sister who was intended to be married to me, and agreed on a tea gift of 180 yuan. On the sixth day, my family used a sedan chair to carry Xu Caibao home, and I really didn't know that Xu Caibao had been enticed by Zhu Zhang Xiuying. The official asked them since they were sisters, why did they have different surnames? Hou replied that Zhu Zhang Xiuying said she was her maternal uncle's daughter. Finally, Wang Jianchun, the lawyer hired by Hou Bosheng, rose and defended for a long time. The judge said that the case was clear, so he concluded the hearing and awaited sentencing. Zhu Zhang Xiuying was sent back to custody to await instructions.</p>

He immediately reported this to the police station, who dispatched a car to take him to the hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, due to severe poisoning, he could not be saved and soon died. The body was sent to the coroner's office for a special examination, while the family of the deceased was being investigated. The cause of the suicide was reportedly due to economic hardship.

Yesterday afternoon, around eight o'clock, after Yin finished his dinner, he and other fellow apprentices went outside to cool off because of the hot weather. Because it was dark, the group suggested finding a way to connect a light outside. Yin was instructed to fetch an electric wire to connect to the power. Carelessly, Yin touched the live light socket with two fingers. Instantly, the electric current threw him several feet away, electrocuting him to death on the spot. Other fellow apprentices saw this and rushed to check on him, but he was already dead. They immediately reported it to the police station, who transported the body to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<p>Li Shaoguang, a mental health therapist currently residing at 41 Huayuanfang, Jinshenfu Road, had already engaged in the study of mental medicine during his studies at Southeast University. After more than ten years, his experience and knowledge have become extremely rich. He has a unique understanding of various modern mental therapies. Since Zhao Hengti, Xu Shiying, Zhang Taiyan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, and other famous figures in the country persuaded him to stay in Shanghai to practice medicine, three years have passed, and his achievements have been outstanding. All those who have received his treatment have seen remarkable improvements. Moreover, he does not haggle over consultation fees. In the past, when Sun Houzai's wife suffered from tuberculosis, hemoptysis, and severe chest pain, Mr. Li braved the wind and rain to treat her, and she recovered after ten treatments. Not only did he not receive any payment, but when they were in dire straits, he lent them a dozen silver dollars to help them through their difficulties. Sun, originally from Zhejiang, had fallen into the officialdom. The elderly couple had never met Li before, but they were introduced by a friend. He is so chivalrous and his intention to save the world is commendable. It is now heard that Mr. Li, recognizing that illness is a significant loss to mankind, and that nine out of ten cases can be cured without medication, and in light of the current economic downturn, many poor patients suffer and ruin their futures due to the high cost of medicine, he has decided to offer reduced-fee medical treatment starting from today. Except for Sundays, there will be morning clinic hours from 9 AM to 12 PM, with only a registration fee of four jiao in silver dollars, and medical fees are waived to benefit the poor. In the afternoon, from 1 PM to 4 PM, there will be regular clinic hours with a medical fee of one yuan. The fee for house calls and long-distance treatment is also one yuan, which is also an affordable price. However, for special appointments, the consultation fee is still five yuan, and the house call fee is ten yuan. All of the above registration fees are as usual.</p>

<p>The Rongji Great World is Shanghai's only mass entertainment venue. With low ticket prices and a variety of performances, it attracts visitors like rivers flowing into the sea. Therefore, its business is very prosperous. In the past, this amusement park employed male and female tea servers, distributed throughout the venues, to serve guests and offer tea, for the convenience of visitors. Unexpectedly, these tea servers have recently dared to secretly demand exorbitant tips. When the management of Changfa discovered this, they immediately dismissed all of them and closed the tea rooms to avoid extra expenses for visitors. If visitors want to quench their thirst, there are economical fragrant teas available for only one copper coin per cup. This is truly a well-deserved policy of accessibility to the common people. Therefore, the Great World has become even more lively recently, and many people go to the rooftop to cool off in the evening.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn used for sewing comes in two sizes: 200 yards and 500 yards. Although someone in our country had previously started a business for the 200-yard size, it ultimately failed due to its inability to compete with foreign goods. Several companies in our country have started businesses for the 500-yard size, and the best of them is the Red Lion brand. The 500-yard foreign cotton yarn was originally capable of being defeated by domestic cotton yarn. Unexpectedly, recently there have been imported goods being dumped on the market at very low prices. The sales methods are also meticulous. The future of our domestic cotton yarn is truly worrying. Recently, it has been heard that the manufacturers of the Red Lion brand cotton yarn, in view of this situation, have carefully studied and reduced production costs so that they can offer the same price as imported goods. The cotton yarn products were launched on August 1st.</p>

<p>Jiangyin: It has been one month since the establishment of the Shanghai Jiangyin Fellow-Villager Association. All the undertakings that need to be carried out inside and outside the association are being planned and implemented step by step. The original address of the association was at No. 10 Jiangyin Village, Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, Nanshi. Later, because the location was remote in southern Shanghai, making it inconvenient for members to travel, it was decided at the first meeting of the Standing Committee to establish an office at Rooms 314 and 315 on the third floor of the Nantai Chang Company Building on Zhejiang Road, Ningbo Road. The rooms are spacious and the location is convenient. There is also a telephone installed with the number 95873, which is very convenient. The temporary equipment costs for the location were decided at the first joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees to be donated by the Executive and Supervisory Committee members. The chairman of the association, Xi Rungeng, and the director of general affairs, Liu Yongkang, were responsible for the arrangements, which were completed on August 4, and the office was moved in.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, stating that the Shandong area is cloudy with winds varying from northeast to southeast. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River are cloudy but still sunny with southeast winds. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River have moderate to strong northeast to southeast breezes. The area around Taiwan and the east of Dongsha Island has severe cyclones. This is due to a hurricane passing through the Taiwan Strait and moving northwest, with two small centers between the Bashi Channel moving northwest. The center of the hurricane was located at noon within about 30 miles of 24 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude. The wind force is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the temperature in this city reached a high of 93.4 and a low of 77.2. On the same day last year, the high was 102.2 and the low was 76.3.</p>

<p>— (Pianyue)</p>
<p>An honest woman, in her youth, seeks a reliable husband to entrust her life to, believing that this will ensure her long-term future stability. A cunning woman, though sharing the hope for long-term stability, would never decide on her nominal husband in her youth. She would rather invest more in cultivating and elevating her own reputation and status, enjoy all the material and spiritual offerings that men bestow upon a young lady, and all the grand honors that society bestows upon a famous woman. Only then, before being abandoned by the times, would she choose her final destination: marrying a husband sought after by the masses but difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>People of the present often lament "the decline of social morality" or praise "the revival of ancient ways," mostly holding a psychology of valuing the past over the present, using the past as a mirror. But if one examines the customs of ancient times and the behavior of the ancients, they also mostly valued profit over sentiment, and those who did not follow the ancient ways were the majority. If one traces back to the most ancient times, it was a world where knowledge was undeveloped and only brute force and aggression were valued. It is evident that every generation is merely influenced by the prejudice that "distant monks are better at chanting scriptures," using the facade of valuing "ancient ways" to measure the present.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Random Thoughts on the Double Seventh Festival <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Among the many seasonal festivals, yesterday's Double Seventh Festival (Qixi), is the most poetic and sentimental. Perhaps it is because the myth of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl is constructed with extreme skill, and the plot is so sad and beautiful. It is no wonder that the general public of emotional young men and women express sympathy and pray to the stars for skill. We do not need to study the meaning and value of this myth now, but we have two feelings about it:</p>
<p>Let us temporarily follow the legend of the myth: the Celestial Granddaughter and the Cowherd, because they owed the Heavenly Emperor a hundred thousand wedding money and were unable to repay it, the Heavenly Emperor exercised the authority of a creditor! He punished them by making them farm and weave all year round, separating them on opposite banks all year round, only allowing them to meet once on the Double Seventh Festival. We can know that being in debt is the most painful thing in the world, and creditors will oppress and bully them in heaven and on earth! If a person can be diligent and thrifty in life and not be in debt, then he can obtain true freedom.</p>
<p>As for praying to the stars for skill, it is also a mistake! Although it is a game, it requires reality. Think about it, they are separated all year round, and the taste of longing is naturally self-evident, so why not think of a plan to seek a long-term cohabitation, how happy and sweet! But even this little bit cannot be done. From this point of view, they have no skill at all, and it is too clumsy for people to ask them for skill.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Words of a Famine Refugee <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The gate was accidentally left open, and suddenly a woman resembling a maidservant entered. She looked to be only in her forties, with a sallow complexion. Her clothes were not tattered, but she was wearing a half-worn summer cloth shirt. She was also carrying a bundle in one hand.</p>
<p>Reaching the courtyard, she opened her mouth and said in a low voice: "Madam, please give me some food." My sister-in-law looked her up and down and replied: "You don't look like someone who is begging for food, why did you suddenly break into my home?"</p>
<p>"Fleeing the famine"! These three words softly entered my ears, and I couldn't help but put down my newspaper and listen quietly to the woman's conversation.</p>
<p>She said: "Last year there was a drought, barely survived: then this year there was another flood, the people in the countryside really have no life left! The whole family is scattered in all directions; the two children have also been sold to others long ago. Arriving in Hangzhou, I originally hoped to find a bowl of rice to eat, but who knew..."</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, my sister-in-law interjected, saying: "Helping others without pay, there must be someone who will take you, it is better than begging from door to door."</p>
<p>"There are so many intermediaries, I have been waiting for two days. Even the rice I had was from yesterday noon! Madam, please give me some food, I don't need any coins."</p>
<p>My sister-in-law was a little reluctant, so she asked the servant to serve her a bowl of rice and some pickles. The woman also asked for an old newspaper, wrapped the rice and pickles, thanked her, and left.</p>
<p>I watched her leave, feeling deeply melancholy. I remembered Chen Zilong's poem "Small Cart":</p>
<p>"The small cart is mottled, the yellow dust is late! The husband pushes, the wife pulls. Where are they going out? The green elm soothes my hunger, I wish to share gruel in a happy land. The wind blows the yellow wormwood, I see walls and houses, there must be a host who will feed you. I knock on the door, no one is home, the house has no pot, wandering empty streets, tears fall like rain!"</p>
<p>Comparing that to this, I think this famine refugee is still lucky.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Strange Country of Abyssinia <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Jian</p>
<p>The African black country of Abyssinia, ever since the conflict with the Italian Somaliland troops in the Wall Wall area last year, has seen an increasingly serious and frenzied arms buildup, without any reduction, merely adding to the good material for international current events. Those who have not been very concerned about Abyssinia in the past have also gained considerable understanding from newspaper or magazine introductions.</p>
<p>The ancestors of Abyssinia were originally Jews. In the past, when Jews migrated to Jordan, a portion of them got lost and mistakenly reached the Abyssinian plateau, thinking they had reached their destination, and decided to settle there permanently. Later, they interbred with Negroes, and the race gradually multiplied, eventually forming the present Abyssinian nation. In anthropological research, there may be another view, but it is quite accurate to determine that they contain the blood of the Hamitic or Semitic race and the Negro race. They have continuously conquered and eliminated alien barbarians. Now, they have a history of more than four thousand years of nation-building. King Haile Selassie can be counted as the 260th generation of monarchs.</p>
<p>Their national character is very strong, and they do not like people calling them "Abyssinia," but want people to call them "Ethiopia." Because "Abyssinia" can be interpreted as "a country of barbarians." From this point of view, they are much better than the Negroes and Hottentots in Africa. As for those who can receive education, except for the upper class, the general public cannot enjoy this right, so most are illiterate. The script is made up of about two hundred kinds, and the shapes of the characters are very special, making it difficult for people to understand. However, when writing diplomatic documents, they do not use English or French, and always use their own language to preserve the national essence. Their laws are based on the "Mosaic Code" and the "Christian Classics" from 1,500 years ago, compiled into a very ancient code. In fact, they mostly judge a case based on the common sense or experience of the judge, without the need for any troublesome laws.</p>
<p>The military accounts for 30% of the total population, or about two million people. These armed masses are all under the command of the chiefs. Among them, the elite and relatively well-trained total no more than 300,000 people. Modern weapons can only be supplied to 300,000 people. The rest simply hold swords, knives, spears, shields, and clubs. As for the so-called modern weapons, the country has a total of 700,000 rifles, 300 machine guns, 200 cannons, 10 airplanes, and 10 five-ton tanks. These weapons are supplied by European countries, and there are also many second- and third-rate goods bought from France and Italy. Even rifles that bullets cannot penetrate are often found. The performance of the weapons is not taken into account at all. Frankly speaking, their old-fashioned tactics of gun against gun and sword against sword are still deeply rooted.</p>
<p>When going to war, in addition to the male soldiers going to the front lines, there is also a group of women (soldiers' spouses) participating. They line up behind, carrying daily necessities, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, trekking long distances without getting tired. When they reach the front line, they camp in the rear, watching the battle situation. Some prepare to be medical teams, and some are responsible for transporting bullets and food, and contacting communications. If unfortunately their husband dies in battle, the wife commits suicide to show her loyalty; or female comrades who sympathize with each other kill each other with sharp blades to show their chastity. The world only knows that the Abyssinians are barbaric, tough, and good at fighting, but they do not know that there is such a female presence inside.</p>
<p>Most Abyssinians regard soldiers as an honor, so many people yearn for it. Because this idea is in their minds, it invisibly makes them fight to the death to defend against the enemy on the battlefield, no matter what, even if there is only one soldier and one bullet left. For example, if a soldier dies in battle, their wife or servant immediately picks up the weapons left by the dead and fights forward until they die. If someone disobeys military orders, surrenders to the enemy, or absconds, they are treated as prisoners of war, without forgiveness, and are executed.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Therefore, I replied, "That's not true! Empress Dowager, so far, this servant has never been beaten by anyone." Although I had said these words, I was still very suspicious in my heart, wondering what the Empress Dowager would say after receiving my answer.</p>
<p>"The situation is forcing me to impose punishment on one of our officials," she didn't seem to pay attention to my answer, as long as I said it, that was enough. Then, she spoke her mind directly, "To dismiss someone who has been in the court for a long time, and who has made some minor contributions in the past, is indeed a very unpleasant thing! However, since he has done something wrong and has been thoroughly investigated, then he must be punished; if we lightly let him go without giving him some punishment, the result will inevitably be that the governors of all provinces will take the governor of Guangdong as an example, and generally become corrupt and pervert the law. What kind of system would that be? So, according to the law, the punishment he received is really fair enough: but there is still some regret, although he should be punished, but it always feels a little uneasy for us who can only勉守法度 [barely abide by the law] to punish him! Have you ever heard people say that when a father encounters his son doing something wrong, and he has to punish him with his palm or a stick, there is always a kind of painful feeling in his heart."</p>
<p>What feeling? I haven't heard anyone say that!</p>
<p>"Ah! What is it? Can Old Buddha tell this servant?" I asked very sincerely. (382)</p>

<p>Zhiqian smiled faintly and snorted in his nose, saying: Who can know what will happen in the future? Huanhua lowered his head again to play with the teacup, unable to speak. He looked at Zhiqian's face and then said in a low voice: Once Mr. Cheng explained it, I also felt that this matter was done wrong. However, only I am sad in my heart. It is too late for me to think of a way to save him. I know that Mr. Cheng has a heart of Buddha and will definitely not think anything about him, but only pity him. At this time, Mr. Jia has probably gone out. I can go to him and see. I can ask him, does he feel happy or sad? Zhiqian said, no need to ask. As an outsider, why should I care about those idle matters. Just after saying this, he made a contemplative look and said: If you didn't mention it, I would go and talk to him, which is not impossible. Huanhua put away his sad look and smiled: Of course, I can't say that Mr. Cheng asked me to go. Saying this, he walked towards Jia Duocai's room. But when he arrived there, he saw that the door was tightly closed. Even Yueying had gone out. Just as he was about to turn around and ask the tea room, he heard Yueying cough twice in a row inside. He smiled and said: Mrs. Jia, open the door, I want to come in and talk to you. Yueying opened a crack in the door, looked out, and then let Huanhua in. Huanhua saw that there was nothing unusual in the room, only two small paper-folded toys on the table. He smiled and said: I thought you were sleeping in the room. Sitting in the room well, what are you doing with the door closed? (282)</p>

<p>(2) Each unit must first notify this committee of the approximate number of officials and athletes attending the conference before August 15 by mail or telegram, so that the reduction certificates for boats and vehicles can be filled out. This should be noted second.</p>
<p>(3) The athlete registration certificates, various registration forms, national martial arts rules, national martial arts registration forms, etc. of this committee have all been sent to each unit by registered mail one after another, so that each unit can immediately prepare to handle registration procedures. If there are any errors or losses in the above items, resulting in failure to receive them, please write directly to this committee for reshipment, and do not wait and delay the time. If there are any questions, please also use mail and telegram to consult at any time, hoping to get a full understanding. This should be noted</p>
<p>(4) In order to make the various competitions proceed in an orderly manner, this committee has specially formulated a competition and review agreement, which has been sent to each unit at the same time as the registration form. After each unit receives this competition agreement, it is best to follow it within the possible range when holding sports meets or preliminary elections, so that athletes can get practical experience in the field, so as to reduce difficulties when the conference is held in the future. This should be noted fourth.</p>
<p>(5) Athletes participating in the national martial arts competition must be amateur athletes. The amateur sports rules are those formulated by the China National Sports Association. To facilitate後[later]　利[benefit]　考[examination]. 慶請[Celebratory request] 注意者五[Attention fifth].</p>
<p>(6) Weightlifting competition is one of the items in the World Games. This committee has also included it in the performance, as preparation for participating in the Berlin World Games next year. The weightlifting rules translated in this notice are those sent by the Berlin World Games (arrived in early July this year) and will be adopted by the World Games next year. This rule has strict regulations on weightlifting movements and fouls, etc., which are by no means comparable to the stone carrying methods commonly used by our people. Therefore, athletes participating in the weightlifting performance must carefully read the articles of the rules and make full training in advance. Do not blindly believe that your strength is superhuman and think that it is enough, so that your movements are not in compliance with the regulations during the official competition and you are judged to have failed. This should be noted sixth.</p>
<p>(7) Athletes participating in track and field events are not allowed to participate in more than four events per person, and swimming is also limited to no more than four events per person, except for relays. This committee does not limit the participation of the same athletes in all-around sports, ball games, and national martial arts competitions, but participants should each estimate whether their physical strength can bear this heavy task, and whether the time of each competition conflicts (if there is a conflict, this committee will怒不通[angrily not communicate]　充分之者處[Those who are sufficient] The ratio should be noted.</p>
<p>(8) Each item, from the rules, follows the guard has been modified, each of the eight positions implemented, the women's softball rules have been changed to women's outdoor softball rules, track and field and all-around sports rules have also been slightly modified, and are being rushed to print separate editions, hoping to be in the shortest period of time, with men's baseball, football, swimming, volleyball, tennis, and men's and women's basketball rules, all sent to each unit for application, each unit before receiving this committee's various rules, please try to purchase the latest published English original nearby, first try it out, and period循然[follow], This should be沈意[ponderous] eight.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Women's Softball Rules Determined: The Women's Outdoor Softball Rules are to be Used <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Baseball is regarded by the world as the national sport of the United States, and many countries have also adopted it. This is because its amount of exercise is quite appropriate, and it has a great function in training the individual's thorough thinking, agile action, mutual cooperation of the group, and the virtue of sacrificing oneself. This kind of game has been introduced into our country for many years, but because the equipment is uneconomical, the game method is not suitable for the general psychology, those who learn it are few, and it is not valued by the public. Baseball originally has indoor and outdoor divisions. Because the translations in various places in our country are not unified, some call it baseball, some call it softball, some call it club ball, and some even use the name baseball. Until recent years, it has gradually become unified, and the name baseball is used for men's games, and the name softball is used for women's games, which has become a habit.</p>
<p>However, according to the United States, there are still several different rules for softball, which are applied in various different environments, such as Indoor Baseball Rules (Indoor Baseball Rules), Playground Baseball Rules (Playground Baseball Rules), Outdoor Baseball Rules for Girls and Women (OutdoorBaceball Rules for Girls and Women), etc., which are respectively applicable to men and women's indoor games, playground games, and those specifically for women's outdoor games. Since the Fifth National Games listed women's softball as one of the championships, the indoor softball rules were used as the designated rules, and the competition was held outdoors. Although no inconsistencies were found in the trial implementation, the rules and the suitability of the venue environment ultimately failed to achieve their full potential. In view of this, the organizing committee of this conference has been thinking about improving it, so it has been decided by the Standing Committee of the Organizing Committee to adopt the women's outdoor softball rules. This rule is specifically designed for women and is played outdoors, which can be said to be the most suitable. However, it is thought that the determination of the rules is relatively late, and in terms of equipment, I am afraid that all parties will follow the old rules. There will be sudden changes, and there will be many inconveniences in skills training. Therefore, the size of the ball park and the size of the ball have been notified to remain the same, and the new rules will be applied to the game method. Fortunately, the new and old ones have minor differences in their content, and often do not affect the overall tactics.</p>
<p>This rule was published by Spalding Athletic Library No.t zfR in 1935. It has now been translated into Chinese by this committee and is being rushed to print and sent to each unit as a standard as soon as possible. If you need to refer to it before receiving the translation, you are advised to find the original text for reference.</p>
<p>What is even more important is that the scope of women's sports is narrower than that of men's, and softball is undoubtedly a suitable and peaceful game sport. The equipment is not very expensive, and it is of great value to promote it. Therefore, I hope that all units will actively participate in this championship, and hope to promote it more in daily training.</p>

<h3 id="e127">The Competition Unit Singapore is Changed to Malaya <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Third Malayan Overseas Chinese Games sent a letter requesting that the competition unit Singapore be changed to Malaya. The original letter said, "This is to inform you that the Preparatory Committee of the Third Malayan Overseas Chinese Games held a representative meeting in Penang on June 29th and 3rd. A proposal was made at the meeting, stating that the competition rules of the Sixth National Games, Chapter 2, Competition, Unit Ding, Overseas Chinese groups, only lists Singapore, and there is no word Malaya. A letter should be sent to the National Games Committee, requesting that the word "Singapore" be changed to "Malaya." The case has been approved as discussed. Accordingly, we should report the situation. Malaya contains twelve districts, and the Malayan Overseas Chinese Games are held every two years, while Singapore is one of the districts of Malaya. Now your association's regulations only list Singapore, which cannot include the whole of Malaya. We ask you to approve our request and amend it accordingly, and we hope to receive a reply." This case has been approved by the 8th Standing Committee of this association, and the three words "Singapore" in the competition unit have been changed to "Malaya."</p>

<p>In order to pay attention to public health and eliminate accidental dangers, the health team of this committee requests that all units ask doctors to separately examine the physical condition of male and female athletes participating in swimming competitions and male athletes in long-distance races before registration. The physical examination form is specified as follows:</p>
<p>Physical Examination Form for Swimmers and Long-Distance Runners</p>
<p>Height (cm) Weight (kg)</p>
<p>Name Gender Native Place Representative Unit Address of this Association Items to Participate in</p>
<p>Number Age</p>

<p>Pulse Blood Pressure</p>
<p>Date Year Month Day Doctor</p>
<p>During the examination, if any unqualified physical conditions are found, please do not register for them. After the relevant athletes report, the health team of this committee may conduct random checks at any time if it deems it necessary. If the results of the random checks are deemed unsatisfactory, they will not be allowed to attend the competition.</p>
<h3 id="e129">National Games: The Selection of Referees is Decided and Letters will be Sent Soon to Solicit Everyone's Agreement <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>As the Double Tenth Festival of the Sixth National Games is approaching, the preparatory work is also becoming increasingly tense. The construction and equipment of the runway, track and field, baseball field, tennis court, volleyball court, and national martial arts field are still in progress, hoping to be completed as soon as possible. In addition, the selection of referees, except for the national martial arts part, has also been decided. According to Jiang Xiangqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress and Director of the Planting and Judgment Division, he told the Dagongshe reporter yesterday that the referees of this Congress, after he drafted each draft, repeatedly discussed and considered with Director Hao Gengsheng, Secretary-General Shen Siliang, Deputy Secretary-General Shao Rugan, Ma Chonggan, Wu Bangwei, and other related parties, which lasted for a month and several modifications before making the final decision. From August 1st, no more changes will be made. The competition committee will send letters to all the people who have been hired to solicit their agreement. If anyone cannot attend the meeting to serve due to circumstances, they will be sought separately to fill the vacancies. These letters can be sent within days. After all the replies are sent back, the preparatory director will send formal letters of appointment. Jiang Jun also said that he is deeply grateful for the recommendations of referee talents from all parties. He has now included them in the list as much as possible according to their strengths, but due to the limited budget, he cannot recruit experts from afar one by one, and there is regret that there are pearls left out in the sea.</p>

Registration began on August 1st, and in the past few days, shops have been very enthusiastic to register. It is now heard that about 40 rooms on the lower level have been rented, and there are only about 20 rooms left.

<p>Xu Chengji, representative of our country's Davis Cup team, went to the United States with Zheng Zhaojia and manager Karlsen in early April to compete. Although Xu and Zheng did not win in the United States, their performance was unexpectedly good. After the Davis Cup competition, the two also participated in competitions throughout the United States and were very popular wherever they went. Now that the competitions in the United States are over, Zheng Zhaojia still needs to stay in the United States. Xu, however, must rush back because his sister is getting married in Singapore next month. Therefore, he is returning to China with manager Karlsen ahead of Zheng. They are travelling on the President Jackson liner and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. They will stay in Shanghai for about a week and will give a performance at the China Lawn Tennis Association.</p>
<p>Rongpu Welcome Reception</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Qihao, a local enthusiast of tennis, believes that Mr. Xu has returned with honor this time and his skills must have improved greatly. A scholar should be looked at with new eyes after three days. Those who admire Mr. Xu's tennis skills should also be eager to see him first. Therefore, he has pre-arranged for Mr. Xu and Mr. Karlsen to give a tennis performance at Mr. Chen's garden "Rongpu" (next to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital) at 4:00 PM on Thursday, August 8th, after a short rest. He has also prepared refreshments and cordially invites friends who love this sport to come and visit.

<p>Houquan Cup Summer Football Tournament, the day before yesterday (Sunday), Wujin and Feigong first had an exhibition match. Wujin has been working hard lately after being eliminated by Yiming in the last cup, and the team has great hope for the future. In the cup match, Yiming and Waihong competed for the final. The famous referee Deng Xiaoliang served as an honorary official. Yiming's prestige has greatly increased since eliminating Wujin last time, especially with He Jingen, Huang Yongming, Wang Weiming, Xu Jingxiu, and goalkeeper Zhu Yongyuan being the most outstanding. It is not easy to draw with them. Waihong has always been known for its good fighting skills, and Zhu Ruihong, Jiang Tongshan, Xiao Guanghan, Chen Zhigang, and Shen Jindan have been fighting on the field for a long time and have excellent skills. It was originally possible to eliminate Yiming, but the team was unlucky. Some Waihong players often expressed dissatisfaction with the referee, which is a great loss of the spirit of a football player. It is hoped that all teams should strictly abide by sportsmanship and obey the referee's orders during the competition, so as to enhance the reputation of the team. The results are listed below:</p>

<p>The private Xiaguang Primary School in Renqingfang, Huade Road, this city, is a disguised reorganization of the Qiangguang Primary School that was previously banned. The equipment is simple, the content is corrupt, and there is no improvement. Recently, it has been falsely claiming to be affiliated with the bureau and spreading rumors outside. The Municipal Education Bureau sent personnel to investigate and requested the Public Concession Bureau to strictly ban it.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Education Bureau Bans Performing Arts Experimental Institute <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Performing Arts Experimental Institute on Chongqing Road in this city has not applied for registration with the Municipal Education Bureau in accordance with the law. It publishes enrollment advertisements in various newspapers. The Education Bureau, in view of the fact that there are often various film and drama groups enrolling students in the city, and it is inevitable that they will use the name to spread rumors, sent personnel to investigate and found that the organization was not sound. In addition to first deducting the advertisement, it is said that a ban will be ordered.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Shanghai Social Education Society Plans to Promote Alley Education, First Designating One or Two Alleys as Experimental Areas, Implementing Education Methods Based on the Environment of Each Place <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Social Education Society has achieved great success in promoting social education and researching social education academics. The society was originally located in the Municipal Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road. Now, due to the expansion of social affairs, the original buildings are insufficient. Therefore, it was approved by the Municipal Education Bureau to allocate two buildings at No. 8 Banfang Road near Penglai Road, and it will move to the office from today. The Shanghai Press reporter interviewed Mr. Ding Shoutang, the director and head of the general affairs group of the society, yesterday, who told us about the latest progress of the society's work, as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting Alley Education</p>
<p>The society recognizes that the environment of this city is complex, and all social situations are very different from those of other provinces and cities, especially the alleys. Therefore, it plans to use these residential alleys to promote alley education, treating the alleys as natural social schools and providing appropriate guidance based on the composition of the residents. For example, during the summer, when the general public is cooling off, this time can be used to promote education. Also, in places where dirt and dust accumulate, where feces and garbage are often dumped at will, guidance on hygiene knowledge can be given to the people. It is now planned to first use Wenyuanfang on Wenmiao Road in the South City and Banfang Road near Penglai Road as experimental areas. After it has been done successfully, it will be promoted throughout the city. This plan is largely in place and will soon be implemented.</p>
<p>Improving Comic Strips</p>
<p>Popular reading materials are the source of knowledge for the public. Comic strips are especially close to the reading materials of children and illiterate people. However, the comic strips popular on the market are either obscene and unbearable, or full of feudal ideas, which greatly affect the evolution of the nation. The society is aware of this, so it has specially compiled "Sister Wang's" comic strip, which has been published. The content is literacy education material, which is most suitable for literacy school students as supplementary material. It is said that the price is six jiao, and social education institutions and literacy schools will be given a 50% discount. The second type, "Li Amao," has been written by Mr. Xu Zhuodai, a director of the society and a famous comedian, and illustrated by Mr. Zhang Meisun, and will be printed soon.</p>
<p>Assisting Literacy Education</p>
<p>The government of this city is promoting large-scale literacy education this time. The society recognizes that literacy education is the foundation of social education, and in strict accordance with the consensus of the Literacy Education Committee of this city, the work of literacy education in the Yinxiang District of this city is completely undertaken by the society, and Mr. Lu Hailan, the director of the research group of the society, is the director of the district. The first phase of literacy schools has been temporarily established in two schools because the district is rural, and they have been teaching for more than a month.</p>
<p>Establishing Remedial Schools</p>
<p>In order to improve the knowledge and skills of adult illiterate women, so that they can adapt to social life, the society has established a women's remedial school, located near Banfang Road on Penglai Road. Registration can be made at the Municipal Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road and the Municipal Zoo from today. The school will open on September 1.</p>
<p>Cultural Lecture News</p>
<p>The society previously held cultural lectures to revive the national culture movement. The first phase invited the famous scholar Dr. Jiang Kanghu to speak on Confucius' philosophy of life, which was very popular with the audience. Later, because Jiang left Shanghai, it was temporarily suspended. There are already hundreds of thousands of words of lecture notes, which have greatly elaborated on Confucius' philosophy of life. It is now heard that the lecture notes of the two chapters "Zi Yue" and "Cong Zheng" in the "Analects" will be published by the society after being personally sorted out by Jiang.</p>

<p>—Original by Ms. Olcott of the United States, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>"These are Pompeo's slippers; but he never remembers to put them on when he comes back to the house from outside; so he doesn't get them. They are a little too big; isn't that even better? Because this way you won't run fast and can't escape."</p>
<p>"I don't want to escape either, madam," Ned said, opening his dirty little hands before the lovely firelight, sighing at the sudden attainment of this state.</p>
<p>"That's good! Now I'm going to dry you out well, and I'm going to try to get rid of that cough of yours. How long have you been coughing, dear?" asked Mrs. Pei, as she searched her large needlework basket for a piece of flannel.</p>
<p>"All winter. I had a cold once, and then it just never seemed to get better."</p>
<p>"No wonder, living in that damp cellar, with hardly a rag on his back!" Mrs. Pei said in a low voice to her husband, who was examining the boy with an experienced eye, paying particular attention to the emaciated temples, the dry lips, the husky voice, and a series of frequent heavy coughs, which shook the curved shoulders of the patched vest he was wearing.</p>
<p>After Mr. and Mrs. Pei had exchanged telegraphic glances, he said, "Robert, my little helper, run quickly over to Nancy and tell her to give you that bottle of cough medicine and ointment."</p>
<p>Ned's face showed some worry at the mention of medicine, but his fear was dispelled in a fit of laughter as Mrs. Pei made a funny face and whispered to him:</p>
<p>"Listen to my sly Tandy make believe he's coughing. The syrup I give you has honey in it, and he wants some too."</p>

Now that the national crisis is serious, this kind of disciplined group sport is very important, and I hope that this sport will not be limited to businessmen, but should be expanded to the whole country, and every young person should have the necessity and opportunity to receive this kind of sport.

<p>Although yesterday was the beginning of the week, it happened to be the foreign merchants' usual summer holiday, and all business was suspended. Incoming and outgoing receipts and deliveries were even more deserted, and only Chinese merchants relied on to decorate the market. The foreign interbank lending rate was 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, and the clearing rate remained blank throughout.

<h3 id="e158">Securities Government Bonds Quietly Awaiting Environmental Changes <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a steady trend with a gradual consolidation. Trading also gradually decreased, but the trend was still one of fatigue and revival. The talk of currency circulation has not yet subsided. Amid this chaotic news, the various groups are gradually adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The bond market may have a period of consolidation. Large traders are inactive and will all wait for changes in the environment. The 1996 government bond lacks the strength to rise and has turned weak again. It is not easy to be excited for the time being. Yesterday, the opening session was originally trending firm, but due to the sale of the 21st division's bonds, the market price went from high to low. After that, it gradually showed signs of fatigue, slightly decreasing by 2 or 3 cents. In the second session, the 48th division continued to buy in, and the market price suddenly became firm again, generally rebounding by 5 cents to 4 cents. The market price results, except for one or two types that were slightly better by about 1 cent, the other types were still trending weak, slightly decreasing by 5 cents to 3 cents. The 1996 bonds were down 2.5 to 4 cents. The total transaction volume was 6.81 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e159">Cotton Yarn Multiple Scattered Orders Compete to Release, Support for Marked Yarn Fails <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is still weak, and the situation is gradually becoming unstable. This situation is entirely due to the fact that the previous general speculators pulled the market too aggressively, and the current reaction is also severe. In addition to the fact that it has fallen by 7 yuan compared to the peak, the majority of buyers are still calm and holding their purchases steady. Because the inventory is too thin, the industry is hoping for higher prices, but unfortunately, spot yarn transactions are too sluggish.</p>
<p>Giant Amounts Remain Quiet</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market earlier was tight for near-term futures, but weak for distant futures. Buyers were lacking. By the second or third round of auctions, it was heard that spot yarn business was sluggish, and the market suddenly loosened, and a falling trend began again. However, the majority of buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, but generally small investors, with rumors subsiding, competed to sell to close out positions, and the market then trended downward. As a result, each month fell by 9 cents to 1.4 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market sentiment rose slightly due to short covering activities by small investors. The market situation was normal when the third auction closed. As a result, the current month fell by 2 cents compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months all rose by 5.6 cents. The special margin for cotton yarn will be cancelled from tomorrow for all months except the current month. The actual sales were 1,800 bales for Dafu, 150 bales for Shenji, 1,400 bales for Run Kang, 400 bales for Senkang, 450 bales for Renfeng, 300 bales for Dachang, and 350 bales for Shengyuan. The purchases were 400 bales for Mingde, 1,300 bales for Yukang, 1,350 bales for Heyu, 700 bales for Gengfeng, 600 bales for Yuanyi, 450 bales for Shengyuan, 550 bales for Yongda, 1,150 bales for Xincheng, and 400 bales for Taixing. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Are Perceived as Quiet</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still quiet. It is estimated that all dealers bought a total of 353 bales throughout the day. The market price fell by 5 cents to 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of each dealer are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 150 Jiangxi 32 Peers 17</p>
<p>Guangdong 75 Ningbo 5 Changsha 50</p>
<p>Wuhu 4 Shantou 10</p>

<p>The cotton market for August is uniquely firm, with long positions holding on tightly. The concept of squeezing shorts is still strong, so when the market loosens, buyers pull it up. However, the distant months are slightly weak because the US cotton production is expected to have a harvest of over 12 million bales, and market sentiment is slightly soft. However, there are reports of distant-term foreign cotton imports.</p>
<p>Distant Term Shows Softening</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market earlier, all months were trending upward. It is said that a certain Japanese trading company has purchased a considerable amount of new cotton. By the second or third round of auctions, cotton yarn was trending downward, and the news from the US cotton market was flat. The margin for marked cotton is expected to fall tomorrow, and the market price is becoming increasingly unstable. A falling trend began again, and as a result, each month fell by 1.2.3 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the August market was uniquely firm. It is said that there were not many transactions, and buyers' minds were looking high, and the buying trend was particularly strong, which brought up the distant months. As a result, the current month rose by 3.5 cents compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months rose by 1.5 to 2.5 cents. The sales were 1,100 dan for Tongji, 1,200 dan for Dafeng, 2,600 dan for Gengfeng, 2,400 dan for Shenji, 2,000 dan for Taichang, 1,600 dan for Changfeng, 1,700 dan for Dachang, 2,700 dan for Jiacheng, 4,000 dan for Yuanxingwei, 2,500 dan for Changhe, and 1,500 dan for Shengyuan. The purchases were 1,000 dan for Tongfu, 1,800 dan for Hexing, 1,900 dan for Taixing, 2,100 dan for Ruida, 4,900 dan for Yuan, 1,600 dan for Hengchang, 3,000 dan for Yongda, 1,500 dan for Changyu, 1,000 dan for Renfeng, and 2,300 dan for Yicheng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Mill Needs 200 Bales</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is quite clear. The source is estimated to be 960 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 51.50 100 pieces of spot goods sent to the mill from Yufeng Mill</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet 42.75 10 pieces of spot goods sent to the mill from Shenxin Mill</p>
<p>New Indian Cotton Harvest May Be Above Average</p>
<p>The cotton market situation in the past week did not see much change due to the lack of development in the US cotton situation. Although speculators had closed their long positions, the trend here is still firm and high. Spot sales have not seen progress, and inquiries from abroad continue to be disappointing. Mills, except for slightly increasing the amount of marked cotton purchased, are unwilling to buy more. With favorable weather, the condition of new cotton is above average overall. The statistics for the past week are attached below:</p>

<p>Special Margins for Yarn and Cotton Only Collected for the Current Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange, in view of the wild rise and fall of yarn and cotton market prices, increased the special margin for the sake of stability. Currently, due to the subsidence of rumors, the trend has eased. Regarding this matter of increasing the special margin, from the 6th of this month, the cotton yarn portion will be cancelled for the five months of September, October, November, December, and January. The current month will still be collected as previously indicated. The cotton portion will be cancelled for the four months of October, November, December, and January. However, the special margin of 3 yuan per dan in cash, which is usually collected for the current month, will still be collected as before.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Grains Term Flour Slightly Suppressed by Foreign Wheat <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was generally stable. Due to the report of foreign wheat prices, Chicago continued to be down by 0.2 cents and Canada was down by 0.08 cents. Market sentiment initially did not see any vibration due to the slight decrease in the opening price of each month of foreign wheat. However, both buyers and sellers were mostly on the sidelines, and transactions were quiet. Mills were not seen to be dumping goods, and due to the current low exchange rate, orders for foreign wheat were temporarily hopeless. As for the price of domestic wheat in various regions, the combined price was roughly the same as that in Shanghai. There was no profit from selling. With this situation, although transactions were few, the bid prices were slightly held up. If there are no major fluctuations in foreign wheat prices in the future, the market should remain stable. As a result, the current month fell by 0.075 cents, September and October fell by 0.005 cents, November and December fell by 0.01 cents, and January fell by 0.075 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e163">In the Midst of Flood Disaster, the Wheat Market Firmly Benefits <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's term wheat market saw prices generally close to stable in all months after the opening of the market in the morning. The current month initially opened down by 0.02 cents due to the slight decrease in foreign wheat prices. The distant futures also trended flat and weak. Soon, however, selling was scarce, and the current wheat market value remained strong throughout. The combined price of domestic wheat also did not loosen or cheapen. Therefore, subsequent bids were again seen to be firm. Considering the situation of domestic wheat, it is not possible to see it decline after this flood and drought disaster. However, whether foreign wheat will continue to be dumped is the key to the future. As a result, the current month was unchanged, September was up by 0.01 cents, and October to December were up by 0.03 cents. The current wheat was still actively purchased by various merchants. Medium-quality and substandard goods were gradually priced at 0.02 to 0.03 cents. Special high-quality goods were scarce. Shandong wheat was priced at 1.65 yuan per bag. Wheat from Zhangba嵡, Qingjiangpu, Yanghe, and Yaowan was priced at 3.62 yuan. Wheat from Bangbu and Shaheji was priced at 2.60 yuan. Wheat from Bacheng, Baoying, Gaoyou, and Puzhen was priced at 3.567 yuan. Wheat from Daqiao was priced at 3.59 yuan. Wheat from Taicang and Wuxi was priced at 2.55 yuan. Wheat from Yangzhou and Hushu was priced at around 1.50 yuan. The whole city's Shenfu Xin went to 10,000 bags, Shenda 1,000 bags, Fufeng 3,000 bags, and Xinda 4,000 bags. The market is still bullish due to the expected decrease in inventory.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Bran's Off-Market Trading Suddenly Soars <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The bran market is still strong and expensive. With the Eastern companies and domestic companies still continuing to digest the inventory, market sentiment is unusually firm. Although there were no formal transactions yesterday, scattered bran has already been bid at 1.20 yuan, and Fuxin bran has already been bid at 1.30 yuan. As for the price fluctuations of bran, they are very large. It is not surprising for the demand to jump 0.03 to 0.04 cents. Otherwise, if it continues to fall step by step like the previous month, the minimum price for customs entry would be 1.90 yuan, which would also be the minimum record for the market. It can be seen that the price of all goods is severely affected by the supply and demand.</p>
<p>Local and Foreign Rice Improves by a Dime or Two</p>
<p>Local Rice (South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various merchants continued to arrive at berths Nos. 20 and above (a total of 4,500-600 shi of goods). Yesterday, customers continued to take orders, with merchants from Tianjin and Qingdao purchasing over 800 bags. Market sentiment was slightly relieved and has begun to stabilize. Furthermore, the market sentiment in the city and countryside has rebounded, and the market color has reversed its previous state, suddenly presenting a firm and tight pattern. As a result, the prices of various thick japonica rice have already rebounded by several cents to nearly a dime. The medium-quality thin indica rice has generally rebounded due to the thorough price drop in the previous day's trading, except for the high-quality goods that have stabilized. As for the Dongxin continuous price, it has become stable. The supply and demand of Duyang sharp-headed rice are balanced, and there are no gains or losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Fifteen or sixteen boats arrived from various routes. The market price of various grades of white japonica rice was slightly volatile in the morning market, and the price trend was stable. Later, due to the improved demand from various shops, the market trend increased by 0.1 to 0.2 cents. The retail of early-season rice was active, and the price trend was strong. The retail of Baiyuan thin indica rice was dull, and the price was weak by nearly a dime. The rest of the goods were stable.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Yesterday, Japanese customers' digestion of inventory shifted the market from fatigue to firmness. The market was weak and recovered on the weekend as customer digestion stopped and prices tended to decline. Yesterday morning, in addition to the local Yangtze River merchants purchasing, new merchants from Beiyang and Xiamen also started purchasing. Nanjing also made inquiries. Total transactions throughout the day again exceeded 10,000 bags. The sudden increase in purchases from Xiamen merchants, who had not inquired for a long time, was even more exciting. As a result, prices surged by 0.4 cents in the morning and continued to rise by 0.05 cents in the afternoon. Customer digestion was very active, and the future trend is still bullish. Throughout the day, 8,650 bags of Saigon rice, 3,500 bags of Min rice, over 1,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice, and 2,000 bags of Siamese rice, Guimai rice, Sukengdi rice, etc. were opened. 100 bags of Wuhu Yuan rice were also opened. If customer digestion continues to be strong in the next few days, the market will further improve.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Changzhou Cowhide and New Soybeans Enter the Market <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>This year's Changzhou Lingkou cowhide and yellow soybeans have had a more abundant harvest compared to last year, and the products are also of excellent quality. A total of two batches, totaling 270 bags, arrived yesterday and the day before. The goods are dry and are yellow-mouthed small grains. 60 bags were opened the day before yesterday, and the price was 4.25 yuan, which was distributed by the local retailers. 120 bags were opened yesterday, and the price was 4.20 yuan. The market price was 0.05 yuan lower than the previous day. Over 90 bags remain unsold, because the export merchants are not active and the local retailers lack sales. There are only a few active merchants, so the market is inevitably sluggish. With the Jiangxi new soybeans having prices but no sales, the situation of aged soybean flour and cakes is tight, and the market is showing signs of stability. However, the future trend may not be long-lasting, because the new soybeans are becoming less popular and the supply may continue to arrive. The cake sales may weaken, so market sentiment is showing slight weakness.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous: Paper Industry Association Evaluation Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Paper Industry Association held a machine paper group evaluation meeting at the No. 10 Sijing Road office. Liu Minjia was the chairman, and Li Jinghe was the recorder. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, the representatives all stated that with the recent decline in foreign exchange, costs have been increasing. The sales price of each product is more than 20% different from the cost, resulting in huge losses. It is necessary to slightly increase the price to maintain capital.

<h3 id="e167">Vegetarianism <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Some people believe that "Chinese food is better than foreign food," listing it as one of the advantages of Chinese culture. Naturally, for the meat-eating group, accustomed to delicacies and rich dishes, to big fish and fatty meat, whether it's Western food or Japanese cuisine, they all feel uncomfortable eating it. That is understandable. However, they have never eaten tree bark, grass roots, or Guanyin soil, nor have they eaten only coarse rice and simple vegetables every day. They don't know that, born in China, there exists another world outside their world. In this other world, Chinese food is not necessarily better than foreign food. Therefore, when discussing the advantages of Chinese culture, they regard their group's good food as one of the advantages.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, meat-eaters also often praise vegetarian food. It is said that when Emperor Qianlong toured the south, he ate vegetarian dishes at Tianning Temple in Changzhou and couldn't help but smile at the abbot, saying, "Vegetable food is indeed delicious, surpassing venison and bear paws by far." However, Emperor Qianlong did not become a monk because of this. Modern celebrities such as Dr. Wu Lao advocated vegetarianism for health, and Mr. Cai Yuanpei also advocated vegetarianism. But they may not have completely abandoned meat. Using vegetarian food to change one's appetite is good. Especially for those who are generally overweight and tired of oily food, eating some light vegetarian dishes feels refreshing and pleasant. Several vegetarian restaurants in Shanghai, such as Gongdelin and Jue Lin, have good business, relying on this group of people for support. But if someone told them to abstain from meat and remain vegetarian forever, I don't think they would listen.</p>
<p>Several months ago, Dr. Jiang Kanghu gave a lecture on the Ten Precepts for a Good Life. His precept on vegetarianism stated, "Slaughtering living beings to fill my stomach, a barbaric custom for those who lack compassion. In terms of health, there is misfortune, not fortune. Why not eat vegetarian, clean and far from poison! Biting into vegetable roots, the flavor is complete." He said, "(Meat dishes are harmful and not beneficial, and killing small lives is morally cruel. Vegetarianism is both healthy and frugal. But specialized vegetarianism is also very inconvenient. It may be altered at any time. I hope all audience members will be determined," etc. I do not oppose Dr. Jiang's theory of vegetarianism. Even meat-eaters may promote vegetarianism. Moreover, Dr. Jiang's meaning is that vegetarianism does not preclude eating meat and can be altered at any time. Saying that vegetarianism is healthy may be reasonable because rural people rarely eat meat throughout the year, yet their bodies are quite healthy. Saying that vegetarianism is frugal is not entirely true. For example, the vegetarian food at Gongdelin in Shanghai is not necessarily more reasonably priced than the Cantonese cuisine at Dasanyuan, the Sichuan cuisine at Taolechun, or the Beijing cuisine at Zhimeilou. As for saying that vegetarianism is charitable, Buddhist abstaining from killing is the original intention. However, our so-called great philanthropists and great lay Buddhists only do good deeds and believe in Buddhism after they have money. We have not accumulated wicked money, so eating vegetarian and worshiping Buddha are not urgent matters. If there is indeed heaven and hell, we also hope to ascend to heaven, but hell is not necessarily designed solely for us. Whether or not to eat vegetarian, whether or not vegetarianism is a virtue, are not issues we need to pay attention to. Moreover, relying on only a few occasional vegetarian meals, wanting to cultivate blessings for the next life after committing sins all one's life, even if Buddha is powerful, may not be effective.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that the theory of seeking blessings through vegetarianism came to China with Buddhism. People in the Six Dynasties period believed in Buddhism the most, but those who believed in Buddhism and ate vegetarian did not necessarily receive blessings. Emperor Wu of Liang is a good example. This emperor, for the sake of worshiping Buddha, not only endured hardship and ate vegetarian himself, unwilling to harm living beings, but also ordered the imperial physicians not to use living creatures as medicine. He also prohibited weaving patterns of immortal birds and beasts, believing that using them for underwear tailoring was contrary to benevolence and forgiveness. Even for grand ceremonies of worshiping heaven, earth, and ancestral temples, which required livestock, he only used those made of flour instead. He was considered devout in his belief in Buddhism, performing good deeds and abstaining from killing. Unfortunately, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas were useless, and he still starved to death in Hao City.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Emperor Wu of Liang had used sacrificial offerings made of flour that later, some people used flour-made pig trotters and lamb shanks as vegetarian delicacies. Even today, vegetarian restaurants still have names such as vegetarian chicken, vegetarian duck, vegetarian ham, and vegetarian meat floss. I remember Mencius saying, "Confucius said, 'He who first made burial figures, will he have no posterity? For he made images of men and used them.'" I think that the person who first created vegetarian meat should also have no posterity because he imitated bloody things to make food, showing that the desire to eat meat had not been forgotten. It would be better to eat meat frankly. The Sixth Patriarch of Zen Buddhism's saying that "the mouth eats meat, but the heart has no meat" seems quite reasonable. According to Wang Dang's "Tang Yulin," the first person to create vegetarian meat was Cui Anqian of the Tang Dynasty. It is said that "Cui Shilang Anqian revered Buddhism and abstained from meat and blood... When he was stationed in Xichuan for three years, he mostly ate vegetables. He hosted banquets for officials using flour and konjac, dyed with colors, to imitate pig shoulders, lamb shanks, and roasted meats, all very lifelike." This meat-eating official, for the sake of revering Buddhism, reluctantly ate vegetarian, but still could not forget his passion for meat, so he had to use flour and konjac to make vegetarian meat. It was a stroke of genius. If one used lewd desire as an analogy, vegetarian meat would be like mental masturbation, which is quite apt, but it profanes the words "vegetarian" and should be considered a sin. In short, for all those who are devout vegetarians, whether their motive is to abstain from killing, for health, or to save money, I treat them all the same and do not necessarily belittle them. Although we know that vegetarians cannot avoid eating plant-based foods, cannot avoid drinking water containing many microbes, and that not harming living beings is impossible, they naturally have their reasons for being able to go to extremes and not eat meat, and I do not necessarily refute them. As for those who use vegetarianism to worship Buddha and cover up the sins of eating meat, or to deceive for the name of a great philanthropist or great lay Buddhist, that is another matter.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Seaside of Lion City <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>In Singapore, I often stroll along the coast. I love the sea. I love the surging waves, and I love the violent and majestic roar. I love the deep blue color, and I especially love the snow-white silver flowers created by the wind and waves.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the tropical sun first reveals its face, the Singapore coast is completely silent. The sea borrows the dawn from the east, shining golden snakes on the deep blue water. The eastern sea cape is a lush green forest, with red patches affixed to the corners of the white buildings along the shore. The sea breeze blows cool in the morning, and the wooden boats echo with the sound of "kuai nai." The boatmen laugh in the quiet morning, and their strong bare arms support the entire space. The whistle pierces the sky, and its sharp call awakens the dreams of the sinful city.</p>
<p>Most memorable is a foggy morning. I stood on the tip of the cape where the Singapore River empties. Watching the fog obscure the world, the sea roared with a dramatic grand tune in the strong wind. The sunlight was surrounded by the fog layer, and the golden threads turned dim. The lonely silence seemed isolated from the world, and the sound of the wooden boat's "kuai nai" could only be heard faintly. At that time, the world was like a desert island, and even the sensitive soul would sink into the dark abyss of fantasy. A kind of illusion could be heard as the sound of artillery fire, and the sea's raging waves could be thought of as mighty war drums. The boundless realm seemed to be nothingness, and the fog seemed to be a smokescreen. Thoughts would rise and fall like the tides, and all the injustices and angers of the human world would surge like the raging waves. The body seemed to assimilate into the space and time of Tao, and the sea seemed to swallow my life.</p>
<p>At night, the Singapore coast is filled with shadows, and the soft, green grass is filled with wanderers from foreign lands. The tide incessantly beats against the stone shore, and the long breakwater in the sea lies far away as a long black shadow. The night wind incessantly blows around the body, but beside the European War Memorial, one can occasionally hear a faint sigh. Qiu and I often sit on the stone fence, letting our feet hang down towards the sea. The sea breeze blows away Qiu's gray tears, and the sea swells up the young man's bright red blood. Every night, the sea's waves beat in Qiu's heroic heart, sending him straight to the battlefield. The sea changed the fragile outlook on life, and the sea often made people's passions boil.</p>
<p>On a moonlit night, the moon's silver light sprinkles on the sea. Snow-white waves jump and dance wildly in the lights of the ships everywhere. The sea washes away the wounds of the human world, and the moonlight stretches out its hand longingly to comfort the human world. The licentious music of the Raffles Hotel is hateful, but the boatmen's songs are lovable. The sea's raging waves eliminate the booming sound of cars on the shore, and only the line of light and shadow of a small steamboat, moving forward and disappearing, will attract attention.</p>
<p>On the coast of Lion City, the sea swelled my imagination, and the sea strengthened my will; the sea erased the wounds of my friends, and the sea eliminated the nightmares of the vagrants.</p>
<p>I love the sea. I love the coast of Lion City.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Our River Embankment Has Collapsed (Part 1) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>"We common people," a young man with broad shoulders and thick lips, who had fled the disaster and arrived here, began to tell his story not long after sitting down. "There is truly a disaster every year."</p>
<p>The listeners remained silent. The night sky was adorned with twinkling stars, and the weather was so stifling that it was almost impossible to breathe. Sweat streamed down the storyteller's head, making his head look as if it had just been lifted out of a pool, dripping wet. Everyone was bare-chested, except for the consumptive who was wearing a blue gown and crouching in the street corner, smoking a Ma Zhanshan brand cigarette, hiding himself without making a sound. A woman called "Sister-in-law" shamelessly exposed her already not-so-full breasts, feeding her third child; while hugging the child tightly, she was calculating that there were two more mouths to feed in the family, and she felt a pang of pain, like a whip of life lashing at her heart. Some other people, however, were somewhat curious, so they urged him: "Hey, why don't you continue?"</p>
<p>The broad-shouldered man shifted a bit, looked at his wife inside the thatched hut with dull eyes. She was doing kitchen work for his sister-in-law. As if some accumulated resentment was blocking his chest, although his eloquence was not very good, he told people about the suffering he had suffered.</p>
<p>He said, "Last year, our village experienced a drought. Damn it, the fields were all dried up and cracked open, facing the blue sky, without wind or rain, making it difficult for everyone to draw water. With little water and many fields, we often had to argue with others, or else you simply had to wait to starve to death. The big scar on my ear was injured in a fight with Old Ba from the neighboring village at that time; I remember I broke his leg with a carrying pole..." Speaking of this, he spat a mouthful of saliva on the cinder ground, and wiped his lips with his hand. People actually wanted to hear the story of the flood in his hometown, but the speaker dragged on about last year for a while before returning to the topic.</p>
<p>"This year, the flood came!" He continued, becoming gradually excited. "In the spring, it rained a lot in a row, and everyone was worried that the river would rise; so Huang Taiye in the village came out to repair the embankment: each household was assigned to pay for the embankment repair and labor. We naturally knew the importance of the embankment, and if it wasn't done properly, a flood would be no joke, so we were all willing to put in the effort! Although the amount was a bit unaffordable. After a few days, it was my turn to go to the embankment to work, and I brought my hoe there early in the morning. That day was an overcast day, with dark clouds covering the sky, without a ray of sunshine. The river water rolled up waves with the wind. I stood there and watched for a while, and I felt that water was a truly terrifying thing. While I was in a daze, someone behind me shouted:</p>
<p>"Hey, are you loafing around? If you want to die—"</p>
<p>I turned my neck, and it turned out to be some engineer, Huang Taiye's son-in-law, standing there with his hands on his hips, with a pipe in his mouth. I jumped down and started using the hoe to send the mud to the embankment.</p>

<p>I cry softly by myself,</p>
<p>But there are no tears, only</p>
<p>The bitterness that has fallen from life.</p>
<p>Those who left me drifted far away,</p>
<p>Let them flow slowly with the sun and moon.</p>
<p>What warmth is there in the illusion of dreams?</p>
<p>The tired eyes can no longer bear to flicker,</p>
<p>And the temptation of life is falling, piece by piece.</p>

<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>As if I had met a devil, I had been sick for three or four months. For a person who lives alone outside, medicine is a burden as heavy as a thousand-foot stone. I lingered outside the door of the well-equipped hospital for a long time and finally had to leave, leaving only a deep sigh.</p>
<p>My own house is next to the street. Through the thin wall made of rotten mud embedded with broken bricks, I can hear all the sounds outside the wall, such as the choking cough of Lao Liu Gong, who sets up a small stall, the cry of Xiao Ling'er, who is called a wild boar by the children in some high-threshold families, and even the sound of street dogs chasing each other.</p>
<p>There seem to be more peddlers in Beijing than anywhere else. From morning till night, all kinds of carrying poles, with food and supplies, flow in the small alley like an exhibition. You don't have to go to the market or run the streets to make a living.</p>
<p>The vegetable carrying pole passes by more than a dozen times a day. In summer, green and purple vegetables are spread all over the baskets, and raw water drips on them. The shouts are particularly loud and complex compared to other seasons. People with only a few copper coins in their hands can also choose a few.</p>
<p>At this time, what people have for breakfast is sesame seed cake, fried dough twist, and white flour steamed buns. The loudest shouts are "Almond tea is ready... Tofu soy milk..." A small newspaper, as big as a palm, is also on the market. Some tearing sound is pulled out from the hard-stretched throat. You can close your eyes and imagine how small the child is. People who have been sick for a long time will hate this complicated human affair, so they are unwilling to buy even the newspaper. But every time they hear those small throats shouting, they are always moved.</p>
<p>Until the sun climbs into the bed, the sound of wheels rolling also increases. Cars in the nearby big alley also pass through this small alley. If it is after a heavy rain, the sound of the big leather belt slipping through the pond is so clear. Occasionally, there are still horse-drawn carriages that have not been completely eliminated, trotting by. At the corner, with a whip, the hoof sounds slow down again. Stroking my frequently throbbing heart, I know that the person sitting in the carriage is either a fat, bald old man or a heavily made-up young woman, with silk padded behind the drooping hair bun - these authentic locals. On days when my head is too heavy to get up, I lie down comfortably and use all my energy to listen to those sounds, guess, analyze, and evoke many different shadows in my heart. These shadows accompany me, driving away a little pain and a little loneliness...</p>
<p>The shouts of "Fatty oil chicken..." and "Smoked fish..." can make me vomit. My suffocating chest rejects these greasy things. Only when the white pear carrying pole comes, I am happy to support the door frame to explore. Some women who are chatting in the shade of the tree outside the door stop their voices and stare at me, the sick ghost. Fearing being laughed at for this incorrigible craving, I gently close the door.</p>
<p>In the evening, the Zhuozhou man who pushes a small cart to sell cloth always comes twice, beating the small drum in his hand. He wants to stand in front of these houses for half an hour. I can hear the nimble arguments of the several braided girls across the street: some say that the printed cloth from the day before yesterday faded when washed, and some want to measure the cloth with their own ruler.</p>
<p>When the stars are about to come out, the fried meatballs and fried tofu for dinner come to linger again, and the snack carrying poles slowly become sparse. The small alley seems to be quiet only for these few hours. People return to their nests like tired birds.</p>
<p>In sickness, the spirit at night is always so excited. In sleepless nights, I stare blankly at the window lattice. Often, I am frightened by the footsteps of a familiar madman, who always sings Beijing opera. In the quiet night, the sound of his large strides seems to trample on my heart, giving me the last disturbance of the day.</p>

<p>— Written by German Storm, Translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>She was not among those dancing people. As I passed through the crowd of people who were dancing the waltz, I saw her standing by a window, listlessly staring at the chaotic crowd. Her face was as pale as the white rose on her head.</p>
<p>"Do you still recognize me?" I asked as I walked up to her.</p>
<p>Her face suddenly turned red. "I recognize you, I recognize you!" she said softly.</p>
<p>"Shall we dance together, Nali?"</p>
<p>She gave me her hand, lowering her head so that I could not see her eyes; but I saw how her small white teeth bit her lip deeply.</p>
<p>So we danced. We only danced one or two rounds, because she knew that I had not come for dancing. Soon we stood side by side under the large double doors. I could not help but look outside; it was very dark outside, only the beech trees near the house were illuminated by the lights. But a gust of flowing night wind attacked us, making people feel refreshed; I heard the music of the violin and the footsteps of the dancers, and also heard the dream-like rustling of the treetops in the forest outside.</p>
<p>Nali stood beside me without speaking, her eyes cast down to the ground. - I mustered up my courage. "How is Christopher these days?" I asked.</p>
<p>Her whole body trembled, and she murmured a few words, but I did not understand; now two dark red marks appeared on her pale corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>"If he comes here tonight," I continued, "then what will he say?"</p>
<p>I saw her breathing rapidly, her drooping hand convulsively grasping her clothes. "Please don't say it!" she cried softly, "Don't say it here, it can't be said here!"</p>
<p>"Where is it good to say it? Are you willing to listen to me, Nali?"</p>
<p>She looked up at me. "Outside," she said softly, "I want to go out too; we'll dance one more round and then go outside. - When I saw you in the side room, I wanted to ask you to say a few words to me."</p>
<p>We danced once more; then I sent her to her seat, and walked out of the small colonnade outside the door. - There was thunder in the distance: as I walked down the two steps to the open space, there was a sudden flash of lightning, allowing me to look down from between the trees and see the shimmering of the sea.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Disaster of American Automobiles Surpasses War <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The New York Police Department recently posted a notice, awakening pedestrians to pay attention to traffic safety. At the same time, it compared the number of deaths and injuries in the United States during the European War with the number of deaths and injuries caused by traffic accidents, saying, "During the European War, the American troops sent to Europe fought for eighteen months, with a total of 50,310 deaths and 182,674 injuries; while in the eighteen months before May 20 this year, vehicle accidents caused 51,200 deaths and 1,304,000 injuries, showing that the damage is even greater than war," and so on.</p>
<p>This fact deserves our attention. Because it makes us raise a serious question, is the development of science a blessing to our society, or is it harmful to people? This is not without reason. I remember last year at the British Association meeting, someone said that Edison's inventions had increased the world's wealth by 300 million pounds, but others said that these inventions had created hundreds of millions of unemployed people, plunging most people into poverty, which is the same kind of thing.</p>
<p>Naturally, we should affirm that the progress of science is increasing the interests of people. Riding in a car and using various electrical appliances is more pleasant than walking or riding in a small car, and more pleasant than the time without electric lights, trams, telegraphs, telephones, or power machines. The reason why these scientific inventions have caused countless disasters among humans is not in science itself, but in humans themselves. That is to say, as some people in the British Association said, although humanity's control of nature has greatly improved, we humans ourselves are extremely bad. In bustling cities, we have to walk in "roads like tiger's mouths". If you happen to block the path of a car, an Indian curses you, slaps you a few times, and unfortunately becomes a wronged soul under the wheels, the price is only a few tens or hundreds of yuan. Furthermore, various traffic safety facilities are all designed for the "lightness and comfort" of car owners, and the threat of cars to the lives of pedestrians has never been adequately addressed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the large number of car accident incidents seems to be a technical problem of traffic safety on the surface, but in fact, it is not just a technical problem, and it has the same nature as the harm caused by the revival of war to humanity.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Homeland in a Dream <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Jingyun</p>
<p>The accidental thought of home made my head suddenly swell, as if I had drunk too much, swaying heavily.</p>
<p>(Home! Where is home?)</p>
<p>I collapsed onto the bed, my eyes flashing with disordered lights and shadows.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but recently I've been afflicted with homesickness more and more often. Whenever I'm alone, especially in the quiet of the night, home appears clearly in my mind, until my head starts to burn, heavy, and hazy, until I lose consciousness and fall into a deep sleep. However, in my sleep, I often dream of returning home.</p>
<p>(Home, perhaps I can only return in a dream!)</p>
<p>Along a tributary of the North River, I sat in a small sampan, slowly being rowed by a boat girl with a bare upper body, her mouth full of betel nut. In the sampan, I watched the peach-red river water, with its glistening ripples, gently flowing away in layers. In the ripples, coconut shells and dried bananas occasionally floated, bobbing up and down like floating corpses. The lush coconut groves on both banks lay asleep in the hot sun, without a hint of life, only the creaking of the oars of the sampans shuttling back and forth on the river, the crisp sound of splashing water, and the familiar southern tune hummed from the boat girl's rosy lips, breaking the morning's solemnity.</p>
<p>(All these fresh, beautiful, and poetic scenes – from which I have been separated for many years – at this moment seem doubly dear to me!)</p>
<p>The small sampan turned a bend, passing a delta densely planted with tall mango trees. I could already see the atap house behind the tall palm trees standing on the shore. I couldn't help but feel happy, my heart blossoming. This was the home I longed for.</p>
<p>(Home, home is right before my eyes.)</p>
<p>The small sampan approached the shore. The first person I saw was Uncle Da Shun. He was still guarding that half-new, half-old grain boat with his son, but he didn't seem as energetic as before. His arms weren't as thick as they had been a few years ago, the wrinkles on his soy-sauce-colored forehead seemed deeper and more numerous, and his hair was streaked with white. This aged appearance reminded me of my brother's letter:</p>
<p>(After your studies reach a certain point, it's best to come back. Because our parents are eagerly waiting for your return… Now, Father is an old man with white hair…)</p>
<p>(Perhaps Father's old age is even more advanced than Uncle Da Shun's.) My heart dimmed as if covered with a layer of dust!</p>
<p>"Uncle Da Shun, how are you?" I went up and greeted him.</p>
<p>This greeting clearly made him feel surprised and astonished. He frowned tightly, staring at me intently.</p>
<p>"I'm Da Yun, Uncle Da Shun, have you forgotten?" I was a little impatient with his scrutiny and immediately said my name.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're Fourth Young Master. You've really grown up so much that I didn't recognize you, haha," he jumped up like a child, delighted. "Why did it take you so long to come back? Good, hurry home, 'Zuoshan' is always waiting for you… But, Fourth Young Master, business is really slow this year, alas!…" His face sank like a lead weight.</p>
<p>Arriving at the door of my home, it was quiet and still, like a temple in the deep mountains. Even Ah Hua, the dog who liked to sleep in the corner by the door, was nowhere to be seen. So, I quietly slipped inside, thinking: perhaps this unexpected return would make my loving parents shed tears of joy! But when I reached the living room, it was so silent that there wasn't a soul in sight. I couldn't hear my parents' happy laughter, or the singing and laughter of my younger siblings. Moreover, all the furnishings were very different from before. At the same time, there were several leaks in the walls and roof, as if they were about to collapse.</p>
<p>(Where is my home!)</p>
<p>Finally, I went to the kitchen behind the house, which was also quiet and still, the kitchen door half-closed. I walked in, and a wave of damp mildew hit me in the nose, which was quite unpleasant. In addition, all the cooking utensils were scattered and broken, as if I had walked into a deserted village after a robbery.</p>
<p>(Alas, is this my home? Is my home so dilapidated? I couldn't help but cry out, very sadly!)</p>
<p>When I woke up from my dream, I wiped away the tears welling up in my eyes, and lay on the bed, thinking sadly: "Home, can't I even return in my dreams?" My whole heart felt like it was immersed in a cold atmosphere…</p>
<h3 id="e175">Countryside at Dusk <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>The oppressive and noisy atmosphere of the city filled my head. The scorching sunlight shone on the tired bodies of people, and the fishy stench emanating from the tops of the white buildings gently floated with the summer breeze, sneaking into people's noses, making them feel strangely depressed.</p>
<p>"Let's wander out to the countryside! Drift like a rootless duckweed!"</p>
<p>So, I put on my crooked straw hat, wore my sneakers, and hummed a leisurely tune of the young, lightly, trying to absorb some fresh air in the countryside, trying to see the innocent faces of the children in the village at dusk in the velvety green grass.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the white sun was still grinning like a monster in the western sky, broadly shining on the houses and forests on the earth. The iron wire fence of Hongkou Park was white, and young men and women with carefree smiles were running around busily. The sounds of laughter and splashing water from the swimming pool, the only place of entertainment in summer, floated in a pleasant tune, mixed with the wind from the south, and drifted along the Jiangwan suburban road.</p>
<p>As the three of us slowly ran along the solid dirt road towards Jiangwan, the afternoon sun seemed to welcome us with a smile. On both sides of the road were thickets and reeds with fresh wind blowing through them. The emerald green water was as still as a mirror, reflecting the white sun. There was no noisy sound, no terrible atmosphere like in the prosperous area of the big city. Although it was a hot summer, I did not feel the loneliness and sadness of the countryside.</p>
<p>When we strolled to Fudan University, it was the time when the setting sun was about to set in the west, spitting out a brilliant red glow, beautiful and lovely. At that time, with curious hearts and the air of strangers, we wandered around the 18th-century palace-style school buildings, looking at this place that contains a strong capitalist business atmosphere on the flat cinder road. We couldn't help but think of the shadow of the decline of the times, the beautiful scenery seen from under the blue and vast evening sky, and the licentious and desolate of the dark corners of the times from the faces of the young people who were not sad and covered with the rouge of the times - the distorted and terrible atmosphere tightly invaded my mind and heart.</p>
<p>Because we had run a lot of roads, we greedily ate a dish of noodles in a noodle shop near the school, and our stomachs swelled up. Then we crossed the small bridge, with empty hearts, slowly running as if exploring the road of life in a lonely world, our eyes staring at a vast blue sky. The blue sky really seemed to be boiling away the depression, an endless poetic painting, from east to west, from south to north, was always so gentle, like a girl with a shy face, covering the traveler's feelings - we slowly walked along the clear creek, gazing at the green plain, the millet branches and long leaves blown by the south wind, simply like some innocent girls jumping and charming.</p>
<p>The sunset was even gentler and lovelier. At that time, it had already hung under the treetops. Looking out from the broad square of the plain, all I saw was a light gauze with bright red sunset clouds. A blood vessel that was not round and intact came out from the thick and inverted needles of the poplar tree. It really seemed like a beautiful girl was hiding her body, shy and gentle. Yes! Lovely sunset. However, people living in the prosperous urban area get such precious evening scenery! Especially the beautiful sunset, simply cannot be compared with gold. So, we laughed loudly like children again, and the pleasant sound floated with the sound of the dense cars driving past us.</p>
<p>Musical, beautiful, stirring the traveler's heart. The lovely cicada sound seemed to welcome us, singing incessantly, and the swaying tune broke the loneliness of the countryside, and decorated the dusk like a poetic and active painting of elves.</p>
<p>The golden water and the dark blue sky have gradually turned black, the god of night has come, the countryside has gradually become hazy, and the lights in the urban area are also flickering. And we also dragged our tired legs and quickly plunged into the prosperous sleepless streets again. - Lovely summer countryside! Dusk brought so many beautiful shadows that I couldn't see through.</p>

<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>… Who knows, is one instant of true life really not worth the many years of survival?</p>
<p>V. Korolenko.</p>
<p>Friend, when I quietly leave you, please do not follow my tracks, nor mention our past to anyone. Just treat this last farewell as some light ripples in the vast sea.</p>
<p>Perhaps these ripples will subside in an instant, but, in your memory, this instant will never be as quietly extinguished as our separation.</p>
<p>Whether strolling by the sea or climbing in the mountains, I tell you, the miracle of the difficulties between us is hidden here. Do not speculate, speculation will give you extremely painful disappointment and obscurity. If you like, you might as well pick up some shells by the sea and quietly take them back to your home. But, if you are not by the sea but in the mountains, pick up some pine cones that have fallen on the ground, and put them in a small box. Friend, treat them as jewels and treasure them very much! Do not allow a bit of wind to blow on them, nor allow a bit of rainwater to wet them, be attentive and careful: friend, how proud you should be!</p>
<p>However, from now on, the shells will no longer be by the sea, and the pine cones will no longer be in the mountains, they will never see the sky, and will be buried in the box forever. However, precisely in between, it lightly lurks with infinite sadness. Can you hear the string sound of this sadness from your memory?</p>
<p>Now, we are parting. I know that emotionally, our hearts will inevitably hide some inexplicable sadness. Perhaps you are even more in sadness, hoping for my return, which is your only comfort in loneliness. But as time flows like a waterfall, you will know that this expectation is gradually becoming a little empty, otherwise, you will definitely use speculation to compensate for your disappointment. However, the result of speculation is also the same emptiness.</p>
<p>I think you'd better treat it as some ripples in the sea of life, slowly wear away the strong memories, you should treat it as an instant of life that you have never experienced…</p>
<p>Enough, from now on, wind and rain will no longer invade the pine cones and shells in the box, and the giant mouth like a whip and a blood basin will no longer be able to whip quickly and suck our blood. – When our youth fades away, or when the old ruined tower collapses, friend, let us rekindle a bit of old passion from the ashes, and recall that instant of our true life!</p>
<p>Now, I quietly leave you, friend, please do not follow my tracks, nor mention our past to anyone. – Quietly waiting for the day to come to an end, we will use an instant of life to compensate for many years.</p>

<p>Opening "Admonition on How to Behave"</p>
<p>The mortal world is vast and boundless. Patience and harmony are the best way. Do not do bad things to spend the years. Be content and live a peaceful life. Do not betray your conscience. Do not publicize the faults of others. Be cautious in cultivating yourself and be upright. Be patient in doing things and be willing to discuss. Always observe that the string of a hard crossbow breaks first. Often see that the edge of a hard knife is easily damaged. Troubles are all caused by idle talk. Disasters are mostly caused by enthusiasm. There is no need to argue about right and wrong. Why bother to discuss merits and demerits with each other. The world is inherently imperfect. How can life be without impermanence. It is harmless to suffer some losses. What harm is there in yielding a few points to others. In spring, you see the willows turn green. In autumn, you see the chrysanthemums turn yellow again. Glory and wealth are always a dream in the middle of the night. Riches are like frost in September. No one can bear illness and death for you. You must bear the sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy yourself. Even if someone is scheming for you, it is difficult to deceive the heaven above. Since ancient times, flattering is contemptible. It is better to be generous in demeanor and behavior. You must know that you should be burdened by fragrance. And because there are too many silk threads, life is in danger. If you are a person, you rely on wealth and power. You may be afflicted, and because there is a lot of wealth, you may be weakened by illness. You should still spread benevolence and righteousness and practice convenience. Help the poor and support the needy, learn from Mencius. Extend your life and enjoy eternal health.</p>

It has been almost three weeks since then, and it could have returned in triumph around the 5th of this month, but unfortunately the weather is not good, and the work is difficult to complete as scheduled, so it is feared that it will have to be delayed for a few days. Now, Bu Wancang's letter is specially disclosed below: "... The kind assistance of the Yellow River water conservancy authorities has made our work very smooth. We worked continuously in the disaster area for five days. Although everyone was exhausted, their spirits were always very excited. Because everyone believed that if they worked like this, they would be able to return to Shanghai in three days. However, the heavens are not beautiful. On the 1st of this month, a burst of heavy rain and small rain wreaked havoc again, ravaging this human hell that had just suffered a great disaster. The rain on this day was really terrible. The sky was as dark as if it had been painted with black ink, and things three feet away could not be seen. Bursts of heavy rain poured straight down like a torrential downpour. We huddled in the hotel with great disappointment, but how anxious our hearts were! Because on this day, we wanted to use the borrowed plane to capture the majestic appearance of the Yellow River and the tragic situation in the disaster area. The next morning (that is, the 2nd), we got up early to see that the sky seemed to have the hope of clearing up, but we received a letter from the airport saying that the airport was wet and could not take off, so we had to wait another day. On the morning of the 3rd, we were able to fly into the sky, but when we looked at it, the clouds were low and not suitable for photography, so we had to give up and fly down, so we are now waiting for the weather to clear up..."</p>

<p>Among the movie theaters that screened first-run domestic films, Xinguang has already announced its summer shutdown. Now only Jincheng is left. The slump in the domestic film industry is a bit scary. The trailer for "Little Angel" has already been seen in the newspapers. It is said that Jincheng will follow the screening of "Black Shadow" with the screening of this film, which is not necessarily good news.</p>
<p>There are also trailers for films such as "Goddess of Liberty," "Stormy Seas," "Tianlun," and "Mother" listed in the Jincheng Theater brochure, which are probably to be screened after "Little Angel." I hope that in this summer, Jincheng, the only relatively high-end theater that specializes in screening domestic films, will screen more new films, so that a group of movie fans who support domestic films will not feel disappointed. And don't let the sluggish film industry remain sluggish.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Japanese Temple Architecture (Part 2) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Itō Chūta (Author), Zhang Guangzheng (Translator)</p>
<p>The Significance of Religious Architecture</p>
<p>If we now interpret mankind as a combination of spirit and flesh, and apply this interpretation to architecture, we can recognize two types of architecture: spiritual architecture and physical architecture. Religious architecture belongs to the former, while non-religious architecture belongs to the latter.</p>
<p>That is to say, if the former can be called spiritual, then the latter can be called material; if the former is said to be of faith, the latter can be said to be practical. There is a clear distinction between the two.</p>
<p>In short, the object of religious architecture is the gods and Buddhas beyond humanity. The object of non-religious architecture is mankind. The spirit is immortal, and the life of the spirit is eternally unchanging. However, human life is like morning dew, and the life of the flesh changes like a revolving lantern. Therefore, the architecture of the spirit needs to be permanent, and it is necessary to have a style that gives a spiritual impression. The architecture of the flesh does not need to be permanent; it is sufficient if its appearance is in harmony with the material requirements of the building.</p>
<p>The Ideal of Temple Architecture</p>
<p>The most common Japanese shrines are those dedicated to the imperial ancestors. The Ise Grand Shrine, located above other shrines, is exceptionally grand. As for other shrines funded by the government and various shrines of lower ranks, they all follow the meaning of worshiping the immortal spirits. Therefore, their main halls always preserve the ancient style and are never arbitrarily altered.</p>
<p>However, people do not understand this principle, and some even believe that, for the sake of preserving the shrine permanently, it is possible to build it firmly with steel frames, iron bars, and cement. This is a fallacy. The ideal shrine must follow the architectural form from the time of the initial worship. As the saying goes, "Worship the gods as if they are present," which shows that the shrine is the palace of the spirits. A palace built of cement may not fully satisfy the gods. Moreover, some must follow the ancient style of wooden structures and thatched roofs, and this can only be said to be an arbitrary view that focuses on the flesh of the architecture and forgets the spirit of the architecture.</p>
<p>Recently, when the German architectural master Professor Pōrrō Schēdūn first visited the Ise Grand Shrine, he was also excited and praised its architecture for its purity, nobility, and cleanliness. He said, "This is not only the spirit of Japanese architecture, but also the spirit of world architecture." If foreigners are like this, how can we not deepen our understanding?</p>
<p>Generally, people often think that shrine architecture should also adapt to the times, using new and superior materials and applying modern and innovative designs. This is to regard shrines as the same as houses and government offices. I will not go into detail about these and will end here.</p>
<p>Exceptional Shrine Architecture</p>
<p>In recent years, exceptional-style shrines built with cement for the purpose of fire resistance and earthquake resistance have gradually been realized. There are unavoidable reasons and difficulties for this. For example, in the central areas of large cities, there are regulations that prohibit wooden buildings. Shrines in such areas have no choice but to be built with cement. Consequently, they have to helplessly alter the style, which is quite regrettable. It is originally unreasonable for surrounding buildings to be all built with cement, and therefore, the shrine in between must also be built with cement.</p>
<p>Since the surrounding buildings are all fire-resistant, even if the shrine in between unfortunately encounters a fire hazard, the neighboring buildings will not be affected or threatened. Moreover, if there is a shrine surrounded by lush forests and constructed in a pure and elegant ancient style among countless dry and tasteless cement buildings, with a heavy and oppressive atmosphere, it would be like a touch of red in a sea of green, which is so pleasant. People standing in front of the temple have their minds, polluted by worldly thoughts, cleansed for a moment. Recalling the past and reminiscing about ancient times, one cannot help but feel reverence. Therefore, I believe that in the cement enclosure of large cities, shrines should be built of wood. Moreover, it is even more unreasonable to demand that shrines embraced by lush forests in the mountains also be built with cement. Temples built with cement are simply reduced to stacks of the divine.</p>
<p>Some architects feel that the architecture of shrines has been the same for thousands of years and are struggling to create a new look. Moreover, there are many who are actually engaged in trying exceptional styles. This is a mistaken idea. Architects can freely exercise their creative skills in other areas.</p>

<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>(Sixteen)</p>
<p>—Regarding uses on the construction site—</p>
<p>Menzi Board - When building houses and encountering cement columns (Cement Column), naturally, in addition to tying steel (as mentioned earlier), you need to support the formwork. For this type of formwork, ordinary two-inch by twelve-inch foreign pine material is usually used. However, this is a whole piece of material, only used on both sides of the cement column. But on the other two sides, menzi boards are used to seal the column itself. However, this type of board refers to ordinary Fujian pine or rough boards. These rough boards are called menzi boards as soon as they arrive at the construction site.</p>
<p>Rough Board - Rough Board (Rough Plank) is the abbreviation for one-inch by six-inch foreign pine board. In the construction site, this type of rough board is mostly used as a bottom board for mixing and pouring cement floors. Sometimes it is also used as a roof board. However, when used as a roof board, it is important to avoid the problem of warping.</p>
<p>Tadou - When erecting door frames, the wall body is difficult to rely on. The door frame must be nailed firmly on both ends with long pieces of two-inch by four-inch foreign pine material. This is called tadou.</p>
<p>Insertion Iron - Tying steel on the first step of the foundation (i.e., the bottom large material or pier, etc.) is done in the same way as working in the bottom. If you encounter a place with columns, it is best to tie it up from the root. This can save a lot of procedures in the work. However, sometimes, because of "life" violations (as mentioned earlier), you have to tie it later. In that case, it is necessary to pre-set the two-foot-long end of the column iron in advance. This type of end is called insertion iron.</p>
<p>Dou - The mixing method of cement, yellow sand, and gravel for mixing cement has certain rules in the construction site. Almost 1-3-6 is used for mixing the bottom and the whole floor. 1-2-4 is used for mixing large materials, columns, floor slabs, etc. The meaning of 1-3-6 is one part cement, three parts yellow sand, and six parts gravel. 1-2-4 can be deduced by analogy. However, there are also certain rules in the construction site for the quality of this 1-3-6 or 1-2-4. Because the quality of one part is a combination of one foot high and one foot wide, one part is one cubic foot. Three parts is three cubic feet. Six parts is six cubic feet. However, the amount of the size must not be randomly shoveled by the handyman with a coal shovel. Then use a prepared bucket to measure its quality. There are two common ways to make buckets. One is one cubic foot, and the other is two cubic feet. (That is, one foot high, one foot wide, and two feet long.)</p>
<p>Mantang - Making coal ash or cement on the ground floor is called mantang. (Note: The three words "cement" are the abbreviation for cement concrete).</p>
<p>Dui Ba Sun - A piece of wood that is one inch and six or seven points thick and four or five inches long. It is cut diagonally at the corners in a straight line to become a long triangle. The equipment used to support the bottom of the head to tighten it is called Dui Ba Sun.</p>
<p>Kaozi - If gravel is used to build five or six-story high-rise buildings on the construction site, it is considered as important as cement and yellow sand. There are many places where gravel is produced. The use of Songjiang goods is more common in construction sites. However, there is another type of gravel that is artificially beaten out. Most of them are from the Taihu Lake area. This type of gravel that is beaten out is not as good as the Songjiang goods that are machine-rolled. At the same time, because of manual beating, the gravel itself is not as uniform as the machine-rolled Songjiang goods. However, this type of artificially beaten gravel is called Kaozi.</p>
<p>Shidao - The work done on the construction site is mostly based on the sample. However, sometimes the work that should be done does not match the size of the sample. Borderline (details previously) things happen in the facility engineering. But since it touches a borderline, there must be a solution. This solution, inevitably depends on the foreman, contractor, modeler, and owner discussing it. In the construction site it is called Fan Shidao. As for Shidao, it means to research.

<h3 id="e190">From Architectural Art to the Temples of Greece (5) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>——The most glorious page in the history of world architecture——</p>
<p>(D) Zhi Tou "Capital" The Order has a very close relationship with Greek temples. The representative works of each period differ due to the relationship of the capital. The organization of a temple, the capital is one of its essential elements, and the name of the temple also varies depending on the number or form of the capital! From this, you can know how important the capital is to the temple! At that time, the most important capitals were three:</p>
<p>1. Doric Order</p>
<p>2. Ionic Order</p>
<p>3. Corinthian Order</p>
<p>Among the above three types of temple architecture, the most used is DoricOrder, so you can imagine how old the history and age of this capital is. As for the details of the capital, it will be discussed in a special section below, because it occupies a very important position in the temple!</p>
<p>(E) Step Stone The steps of Greek temples are usually three steps, but there are also two steps. The steps of the Parthenon temple are very special; the steps of this temple have three levels, one foot and eight inches high, and two feet and four inches wide. Because the steps are high and large, it is not easy to walk up; therefore, there are small steps in the middle of the large steps in front and back doors to facilitate people to walk up? This kind of temple with small steps in large steps is rare. And the width of each temple is referred to the size of the lowest step as the standard. It is also one of the important parts of the temple.</p>
<p>(F) Building Materials Why are there ingenious, bright, and great works of Greek temples? The reason lies in the result of using good building materials. Because architecture is a product of material as the body and design as the spirit, the material is improved due to the design, and the design is established due to the material; the two assist each other and supplement each other to achieve the perfect procedure of architecture. The so-called design is the technology of carving. If you want to seek the delicacy of carving, you must be cautious in the selection of materials.</p>
<p>At that time, the most widely used building material for temples was marble (Morblo), mostly used on the inner roof of the temple and the exterior of the capital. The most common use of marble is yellow marble, which is transported from Pentus Island and is called Penteric marble, which is one of the most famous building materials in the world. Because the patterns of these materials are extremely fine, and the colors are very similar to human skin color, after carving characters on them, they are particularly vivid and delicate due to the relationship of the colors, which greatly increases the beauty of the entire building. In addition, the foundation of the temple is mostly paved with whole pieces of limestone (Jine stone). And the interior of the palace is always based on the use of luminous materials; in this way, even if there are no windows around, people who enter it will not feel dark. This is one aspect of the situation of building materials.</p>
