<h3>國際聯盟應有之自覺</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>本界國際聯盟大會。於東菲戰爭一觸卽發之際開幕。國聯生命千鈞一髮。旁觀者莫不希望國聯能自覺自勉。一掃舊日之積弊。向振作新的精神。以應付此艱難局面。旬日以來。大會所表　。有可樂觀者亦有可悲觀者。夫國聯過去萎靡不振。號令不行之原因甚多。而其中最顯著者。一則爲會員國對於盟約　護之不誠意。於制裁問題。太缺乏熱忱。二則爲國聯範圍之不能世界化。歐洲國家把持理事會。而二三歐洲大國。又把持歐洲各國之發言權。使此國際聯盟。成爲二三歐洲大國之御用機關。此二弊端。凡擁護國聯理想。及盟約眞精神者。莫不思加以改革。吾人深覺國聯之能否生存。有否生存之價值。均視此二問題而决定。</p>
<p>過去對國聯盟約。表示冷淡。對於制裁。表示不願參加者。會員國中。當以英國及其各自治領爲最。九一八事件使。西門外相之徒。稍効忠於日內瓦。而稍以英國海軍及經濟之力。以爲盟約之後援。則遠東戰爭之結局。當不至如今日也。擁護制裁政策者。本以法國爲首領。小恊約國等從之然。法國以英國態度之不可靠。亦不願單獨冒險。國聯盟約無力量爲後盾。於是弁髦集體和平者。乃得自由行動。日本恣意於前。意大利效顰於後此次國聯大會。英國以其切身利害關係。奮然而起。願作盟約之忠僕。法國見風轉舵。繼而表示効忠。霍爾及賴佛爾之演說。爲國聯開一新生路。俄比諸國。和者紛然。意者國聯經此度表示後。其第一缺點。稍有革新之可能。此則吾人認爲樂觀者也。</p>
<p>更就第二弱點言之。國聯對於遠東關係。殊爲蔑視。理事會現任理事十四人之中。竟無一個遠東國家。故自國聯成立以來。每次大會。中國代表必以中國之在理事會中席次爲爭。理　會會員三種。常任者限於英　俄　。非常任者八名。由大會每年選換二分之一。地域分配。亦甚嚴。介於此一種之問者有半常任理事。卽任滿後可以連選運任。波蘭西班牙是也去年吾國任期屆滿。競爭連任而失　。國人方以把持國聯諸國。不顧及遠東四萬五千萬國民之權利爲痛心。今歲大會。吾國代表。事先巳作活動。希望獲得非常任理事一席。乃昨日選舉結果。我國又復落選。中國年向國聯繳納鉅費。其國之人口富源·歷史·文明·均非波蘭西班牙·意大利輩之所能比擬·且自九一八以來·中國因矢忠國聯。所受犧牲已至可驚。國聯與中國技術合作。使南京與日內瓦間。關係日密。而諸大國竟不考慮及此。悍然置中國人民願望於不顧。使此一年四度之國聯理事會。無中國代表之發言權。其不合公平之理。蓋至明顯也。</p>

<p>各單位注意事項</p>
<p>（一）各單位須自行製辦隊旗一面、以備開會時應用、其顏色大小及式樣、由各單位自定之、</p>
<p>（二）各單位負責人員、　於選手出發前、召集各選手練習大會會歌、並須將歌譜歌詞（與上屆大會同載於籌委會通告第一號）印發選手、以便開幕典禮時應用、</p>
<p>（三）各單位選手之服裝、須力求整齊、以壯觀瞻、而振精神、</p>
<p>（四）大會表演項目中之舉重與競走兩項、爲世界運動大會節目之一、本會雖未列爲正式錦標、但爲檢閱實力、以供來年選拔世運選手之參考起見、至希會有相當練習而具成績者、報名加入、一展身手、藉以考核國人對此兩項競　之程度、</p>
<p>（五）各項球類選手之號布、本會概不發給、應由各單位於製發此項制服時、自行預爲規定、始得報名註冊、其詳細辦法、巳於籌委會通告第二號第五項第四條中明白規定、但男女籃球球隊員制服之號數、不得用（一）號與（二）號、此爲籃球規則所規定、蓋籃球比賽時、栽判員與簽察昌宣佈球員之犯規、常用手指作記號、舉一指者、表示罰一次、舉二指者、表示罰兩次、此項無聲暗記、爲籃球裁判員所習用、如制服中有（一號　（二）號、則易使記錄員誤解裁判員之「一指與二指」爲「一號球員」與「二號球員」、爲免各單位製發制服時疏忽起見、特提出以請注意、</p>
<p>（六）大會會塲在市中心區、以地方曠野、蚊蟲較多、各單位選手、務須自備蚊帳、俾入夜得以安跟、兼防瘧疾、各單位負責人員、更須督促各選手目備面巾面盆、以免砂眼傳染、而重衛生、</p>
<p>運動塲地之支配</p>
<p>大會會塲（上海　體育塲）、興工以來、巳逾一載、茲市運動塲（即田徑塲）、市體育館、及市游泳池三大建築、均巳先後竣工、跑道及田賽塲之舖草工程、亦於最近完成、排球及網球塲、正在加工趕造中、棒球塲方在破土時期、預計亦可及時告竣、以供應用、截至現在止、建築巳成尾聲、今後所努力者、爲如何佈置耳、　將塲地之支配情形及以後之進行、略述如次、</p>
<p>（田徑塲）田徑塲即市運動塲、爲全塲之主要建築、所費亦饅鉅、其偉大可稱空齣、惟其內部平面之建築、因最後經費不敷、稍嫌因陋就簡、而覺美中不足、看台下面、分築上下兩層、上層一圈、闢爲運動員宿舍、可供兩千人住宿、沐浴室及廁所等衛生設備均有、下層一圈、除一部份作辦公室及運動員食堂等外、其餘在大會期間、均作開設臨時商舖之用、刻巳出租一空、跑道爲五百公尺、四週裝置洩水管、東西兩邊爲二百公尺之直道、道寶十三公尺、可供十人分道比賽、各項距離之徑賽、其終點均設於西面之直道上、</p>
<p>田賽塲各項田賽之佈置、每項均有兩處、以供男女或性質類似之運動、可以同時舉行比賽、俾遇時開不敷、而須加速度趕完預定項目之時、可以進行順利、不受塲地之拘束、</p>
<p>跑道南北兩端、尙有廣大之餘地、南端闢爲網球塲、遇必要時、網球將在此决賽、北端闢爲國術塲、將來國術比賽、除踢毽在體育館、及射遠須另擇地點外、俱在此舉行、</p>
<p>（二）體育館　體育館之建築、甚爲富麗、屋頂蓋以鉛絲玻璃、光綫充足、高度舒暢、看台查容三四千只、各種設備、如浴室健身房更衣室廁所等、應有盡有、地板亦極堅固精緻、籃球架用鋼製、可以隨時移動、看台與球塲隔絕、比賽時不致有混雜之弊、</p>
<p>（三）游泳池游泳池已於九月八日先行開放、池爲露天式、長五十公尺、寬二十公尺、同時可容十人此賽、看台用鋼骨水泥製成、可容五六千人、池之容量甚大、置有循環濾水器、以求池水常保淸潔、池底裝置電燈、全池照耀淸晰、燈光水色、打成一片、在夜間觀之、更覺蕩漾悅目也、</p>
<p>（四）足球塲　足球塲原擬闢在田徑塲東司令台之外面、嗣因時間及經濟關係、不能實現、將來大會所有足球比賽之初賽及次賽等、决假用延平路全國體育協進會管轄之申園足球塲舉行、該塲地面平坦、草皮濃密、上海所有國際足球及其他重要比賽、向在該塲舉行、四座看台、可容萬餘人、但複賽及决賽、則在大會田徑塲內臨時佈置之足球塲舉行之、</p>
<p>（五）綱排球塲　網球及排球塲、照原定計劃、在體育館前、現因足球塲不另闢、乃將田徑塲東司令台外面原有足球塲之面積、改築網球及排球塲、共計網球塲八片、排球塲四片、互相毘連、兩端裝置木料看台、可容二三千人、該塲現正積極趕造中、不久即可竣工、</p>
<p>（六）棒球及壘球塲　棒球塲在田徑塲西首、地面極曠、現巳興工、但因限於經濟、地面不再舖草、塲之四週、圍以鉛絲網、看台亦用木製、開會時所有棒球及女子壘球比賽、均在此舉行、</p>
<p>（七）國術塲　國術塲闢於田徑塲之一端、四週用鉛絲網圍隔、賽員與職員之進出口、亦與田徑塲各異、故比賽雖與田徑賽同時舉行、絕無妨碍及紛擾秩序之弊、塲內建一平台、爲比賽之用</p>
<p>場地設備舉要</p>
<p>（一）電話爲求栽判員服務便利及成績傳送之迅速起見、在各運動塲辦公處及田徑塲內、均裝設電話機、田徑塲內重要處所、如跑道之起點與終點、總記錄處、東西司令台、及報告牌管理處、均可直接通話、不特職員栽判員遇有問題得隨時互商、即比賽結果、亦能迅速傳播於令塲、於觀衆興趣、關係尤深、現該項工程、正由市公用局規劃裝置、一至會期、當可實行通話、以利比賽之進行、</p>
<p>（二）決賽成績報吿牌　田徑賽及游泳各</p>
<p>項運動決賽結果、也用播音器向觀衆報告外、誠恐以耳代目、或有錯誤、乃另建成績報告牌、將各項優勝者之姓名、所屬單位、時間或距離、及六人名次、用二尺見方這大字、高懸牌上、供觀衆以準確之報告、該牌在田徑塲者、裝於東司令台頂、高二十三尺、在游泳池者、裝於看台項、高十尺、觀衆雖在看台四圍之最遠處、亦能一覽無遺、</p>
<p>（三）籃球自動記分牌　記分牌用木製、後有輪軸四付、四周漆以紅底自色之數字、軸上用繩繞繫、下懸重量相當之鐵塊、使輪軸時時有下轉之趨勢、每輪均凑合於紀錄牌上八寸高六寸闊之長方孔內、如是則脾上分數、只須輕撥關紐、輪即下轉、而數字亦隨之變更、一如人意、管理旣極簡易、使用亦復便捷、</p>
<p>（四）籃球賽球員名單　競爭熱烈之籃球比賽、觀衆第以未能認登塲球員之姓名或面目爲憾事、雖各球員胸前背後、均有號數可別、但此項標記、僅能供比賽職員之查審而已、對於遙遠之觀衆、實覺無濟、本屆大會爲補救此項缺憾起見、特於記分牌之下部、將每隊登塲球員姓名及其號數、詳細標明、以供全塲觀衆識別認記、此項設備、不特有利觀衆、更有助於新聞記者仇、</p>
<p>衛生設備與工作</p>
<p>值茲秋凉氣候、集國內外水土不同之數千選手於一塲、作此長期之競賽、欲求健康方面、毫無問題、爲事實所不可能、益以開會期間、觀者雲集、意外疾病之發生、亦所難免、故大會衛生組對於一切衛生設備及工作、巳作深切之考慮、關於醫務·預防·保健·及環境衛生諸端、無不有精密之策劃、下述各點、至關重要、幸希注意爲要、</p>
<p>（一關於醫務方面）</p>

<p>（戊）防止腳癬　凡經體格檢查有腳癬者、須立即受衛生　之治療、該組特備大量脚癬藥水、專供患有脚癬之選手應用、同時在游泳池人口、設置藥水槽、凡入池游泳者、必先走過此藥水槽、以防傳染腳癬、</p>
<p>（三）關於保健方面</p>
<p>（甲）體格檢騐爲免除臨時擁擠起見、預先由大會通告各單位先自行檢查、報到時隨繳檢騐證、凡參加劇烈運動及游泳者、再經衛生糾複騐、以示鄭重、</p>
<p>（乙）健康視察衛生組向各醫學校商請、在大會期間、輪流派學生若干名、擔任運動會選手休息時之健康視察、遇有不正常情形、隨時報告該組、立即派醫士護士前去治療·或即由視員察設法送療養室診治、</p>
<p>（丙）健康指導除將健康指導文宇圖表印發運動員外、在運動員宿舍張貼健康生活標語圖表、籍以灌輸運動員衛生常識、</p>

<h3>小男兒（四九）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>先是韜摩一陣怒嗥，繼以全堂的鼓噪，其勢汹汹，不得停止，直到唐恩感覺得彼衆我寡，就提議　刀之戲，誰占勝利　取了那寶物，韜摩答應了，大家環列而觀，臉上都現緊張之態，一見韜摩得勝，　變作欣慰之色，韜糜也就將那柄小刀放在他最安全的一個袋裏的最深處了。</p>
<p>「你和我一同走去，我給你看看各個地方，」乃德招呼唐恩道，覺得他必得要和他的朋友作一點嚴重的密談。</p>
<p>他們倆作什麼的談話，也沒人知道，但後來他們回來的時候，唐恩對人人的禮貌已經好得多，雖然他的說話和舉動還是粗暴的；我們原也何可奢望於這個可憐的孩子？他年齡雖小，卻已飽歷風塵，儘自度着流浪的生涯，從來也沒有人去敎導他的。</p>
<p>童子們巳决意不能愛好他，他們只讓乃德一人去陪他；乃德不久也覺得到那倘責任之不勝其重，卻又不忍捨菜他。</p>
<p>然而韜摩還覺得雖然竹發生過那柄柄刀的事件，他們兩人間卻已有了一種同情的聯繫，常常想和他談談翻觔斗的有趣的題目。他的機會不久也使到臨，因爲唐恩見到他多麼羨慕他，對他也逐漸和氣，不到一星期，和那活潑的韜摩也已經很熟識了。</p>

<p>字體選擇確定後、部方會經擬訂頒布辦法、訓令各省敎育廳局遵照施行、茲將公布辦法再行申述、（一）凡小學短期小學民衆學校課本、兒童及民衆讀物均應採用部頒簡體字、（二）採用簡體字的課本應在各冊末頁附生字表、將簡字表一併編入、幷須於第一批用該字之課本末、或下方或其他適當地方另立對照表有資比對、（三）自二十五年七月起、凡新編之小學課本、短期小學課本及民衆學校課本、不用部頒簡體字者不予審定、（四）自二十五年七月起、凡穿印前條所開各課本、均應採用部頒簡體字、（五）自二十五年七月起新編或重印之兒童或民衆讀物不用部頒簡體字者各校不得採用、（六）自二十五年七月起各級師範學校、均應注重部頒簡體字之敎學、（七）自二十五年七月起各學校考試試卷部頒簡體字得一律適用、（八）各省市縣各新聞事業應由所在地主管敎育行政機關勸令在可能範圍內採用部頒簡體字排印、</p>

<h3>九一八四週年</h3>
<p>— （黃寄萍）</p>
<p>有人問我：對於「九一八」四週年紀念，有什麼感想？</p>
<p>我說：這個年頭兒，說話要謹慎，談不到什麼戚想的。不過有幾句不痛不療的話，倒可以閑談談：（一）一般人鑑於阿國不畏强鄰，始終如一的反抗意國，因而大受刺激。我以爲阿王和各部落戰士衛國保土的精神，值得欽敬，也值得做我們的榜樣。不過我國的情勢與阿不同，自己也得明瞭；（二）國聯究竟是列强分贓的機關，以前信賴它的人，現在總可覺悟！自從日德退盟以後，意國亦將脫退，其實我國亦當退出，每年可省一大筆會費，移作正當用途；反正我們要獨立，不需國聯作保障；（三）弱肉强食，已成公例，將來愈演愈劇，國人應各努力「本位救國」，充實國力，何患患外侮？（四）處今之世，國防不充實的國家，便隨時有受人宰割的危險，所以我人要求建設科學化的中國。此外，我對於「九一八」的感想，便不敢多談。</p>
<h3>山上剪九</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>到過杭州旅行的人，誰都知道張小泉的剪刀很聞名的，尤其是女客到了杭州，說不定還要買上數十把回到家內去分贈戚友。可是杭州的張小泉剪刀店太多了，反把旅客弄得頭暈目眩，究竟不知那一爿是眞正張小泉老店。這一種現象，正和蘇州的陸稿荐一樣，連住在蘇州的本城人，也還辨不出那一家是眞正陸稿荐。</p>
<p>貨色只要好，並不需要牌子老，像現代的潮流要，科學　步的神速，新發明的物品，常常在社會上發見，也很有許多是非常精美的。</p>
<p>山上剪刀，近來能受女人的歡迎，因爲價廉物美，說起這山上兩字，就是洞庭山的簡稱。洞庭山位處太湖的中央，誰都知道的。山上剪刀，是由山上的女人出來叫賣的，淸脆的叫賣聲，拖長了喉嚨，雖然只在沿街叫賣，因爲聲音的嘹喨，傳入了戶內，會給少奶奶或小妣傳喚進去的。可是伊們做生意的嘴巴，又十分厲害，十有其九都成交的。我們從小就聽到做生意的人，佔據商塲最普遍的，中國要算洞庭山和徽州兩處的人。俗諺有、穿天洞庭，遍地徽州，」的一句。今天我們看到賣剪刀的刀山上婦人，有這樣很好的生意經，怎不使人佩服呢</p>
<h3>代哭</h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>在上海，有許多無本生意」之中，「代哭」也是一種營業。</p>
<p>大凡某人家裏有了喪事，而死者或是未曾婚嫁的靑年，做父母的不便跟了棺材一直哭至墳塲，那末，這時候就須僱用那「代哭的女人來了。</p>
<p>事情最奇怪的是，這女人不知從那裏來的這副急淚，伊一走入喪門，看見這個放在廳堂上的陌生屍首時，便以手帕掩面，嚎啕大哭起來，哭得如此傷心，直使過路之人亦爲之下淚，伊是全身在抽噎，打着最凄凉的調子，一字字噴出哀歌，敎人聽了，誤以爲伊是這喪家的最密切的戚族，絕不想到伊是爲賣眼淚而來的。伊是這樣的識了服務的最高效能。</p>
<p>最辛酸慘切，莫如在墳塲時那一會，臨穴狂號，眞似這無情的黃土快要吞沒了伊的自己人二樣，哭得來昏天黑地，使伴送的人也不免百威交集，淚盈雙眸了。</p>
<p>幹這一種營生的女人，無疑的，伊先要有一個極度苦惱的生活環境，而伊自己也該有一條最不幸的運命，不然，無論如何也不會哭得這樣「像眞」的。有人說，伊開始在哭，是假意的，哭到眼淚出來了，伊又想起了自己亡過了的丈夫，想起了自己的苦况，便眞的傷心起來。這叫做「借他人之屍首，哭自己的凄凉一。我以爲這種見解是最爲近似的。</p>

<h3>續智能的遺傳</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>八月一十四日本刊載賓錫君「智能的遺傳」一文，引心理學者Goddard研究Kallikak家譜結果：謂良家子弟Martin　Kallikak因與一低能婦私通，致其後裔四百八十人中，無一非低能兒，讀之使人知擇配是一伴大事，斷不可兒戲的。茲再舉一例。</p>
<p>美國最著名傳道師及思想家Jonathan　Edwards和他的夫人均系出名門，據Winship博士調查其家乘，結果如下：</p>
<p>從一千九百位後裔中，已鑑定過的一三九四人而論，計：大學畢業者，二九五人：大學校長十三人：醫師六十人；牧師，傳道師或神學敎授一百人；海陸軍軍官七十五人；名著作家六十人，曾輯過一三五種名著及十八種定期刋物：慈善家三十三人，其仁澤已溥及國內國外；律師百餘人，最著名者爲敎授Prof．Wooley　Ofg　Yalet法官八十人：任過國家要職者八十人，副總統Aaron　Burr卽其一；參議院議員三人；州長，國會議員，各州行政機關幹員，市長及外國公使若干人；太平洋郵船公司總理一人；鐵道局長，銀行行長，保險公司經理及經營過其他工業企業事務者十五人。據此，可證社會各方面的進步與公共的幸福都和這健康的民族大有關係。還有，其後裔中沒有一人犯過罪。</p>
<p>試把二氏家譜相比，可見夫婦結合宜若何重視！按西諺有云，Like　Produces　Like；我國俗語亦有「龍養龍，鳳養鳳，賊養兒子掘壁洞」等話：證以遺傳及優生之說而益信。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十九回　大員惜羽毛敲六有術新歡離骨肉探病無由</p>
<p>則誠道：你和他們怎樣交涉？介夫道：你去打聽打聽罷。和我先說話的，是中華銀行的西北調查專員，將來西安分行的經理，叫賈多才。後一個是陝西有名的强項令周有容。他兩人都說要把這件事登報，求社會之公判。我再三的說，事情過去了，也就算了，好在館店裏出不出頭，二位又何必和藍專員過不去。你是看見的，被我二言兩語，把他們都說笑了大槪……再能够安慰他們兩句，也許就沒有什麼事了。你如不放心的話，我還可以和你跑兩躺。雖然閣下不承認我是親戚，然而我們究竟是　鄉，我願以同鄉的鄉誼，和你盡一點力。裘則誠這倒有些不好意思，便笑着拱拱手道：以前頗有不足　　介懷了，請到我屋子裏稍坐一下。介夫道：專員若是有話和我直說，我也不計較以往的。　誠道！好的好的，你先請到我屋子裏坐一會兒。他將張介夫引到自己屋裏。　然後去見藍專員。這　，那藍　員不是先前那副樣子了，口裏啣了雪茄，一手撑了頭，靠桌子坐完。臉色只管沉下來，似乎還帶點蒼白。藍夫人呢，原另有一間屋子，然而他並不在似專用的屋子裏，却是和衣趟在老爺床上上。誠進門來，還不曾開口，蓋專員問道。　怎麼了？怎麼了？則誠道：倒是沒有什麼事了。（三一八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第三十三章　上苑奇葩</p>
<p>大體的講，愛美觀念對於女性的確要比較厚些，普遍些，因此女人對於花也就格外的愛惜，格外的善於欣賞；尤其是我們的太后，除掉權勢貨財之外，花卉也許就是伊最寳貴的嗜好品了。雖還不曾够上「花痴」的資格，然而迷却巳迷得很深了！我們的上苑內，各式各樣的奇花異草眞不知有多少種類收集着，凡可以索到或買到的花種，總得設法去弄了來才歇：好在宮內另有一部份的太監是專門在執行着園丁的職務的，他們所具的園藝常識也很廣博，無論那一種花木都能很周到的給太后栽培着，沒有不極適宜地發育起來的。何况太后自己還要三天兩天的走往各處去視察，更不容他們有偷懶或疎忽的餘地！（四一八）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>諧謔的時光</h3>
<p>— 片月</p>
<p>照例的「人生於世」，一天一天的過着，一天一天的長大起來，誰也沒法遏制或留住他，也沒法脫身事外，不與歲月相關，除非把生命消滅了。大家只得很顯明的在做時問的儲蓄罐，紀錄簿而已！</p>
<p>在全部的人生中，自幼而壯而老，循序進展，這也是一成不變的紀律。那麼，不得已而思其次，我們對於人生的過程中，閱時少些或多些，究竟何者較爲適當，這有準確的評價沒有呢？</p>
<p>若抱樂觀的說得好時，閱時少的是「少年英俊」，又道是「英雄出少年」，閱時多的，也是「老成練達」，又道是「讀頭屬老成」，似乎都够差强人意的。</p>
<p>說得壞時，年歲過得少了，不是「少年氣盛」，便是「少不更事」；年歲過得多了，不是「老奸巨猾一，便是「老朽昏庸」，又似乎都不足道！</p>
<p>「江南望見江北好」，人性是頗多不滿足於現實生活的。少年人每稱羨着老者的歷練較多，而嚮往未來，老年人每思慕着少年的天眞爛漫而依戀過去；所以少年很多竭力慕做老者所爲，務達「少年老成」的資格，老者却多勉强保存少年行徑，博取「童心未失」的嘉名。</p>
<p>「有嘴說他人，無嘴說自身」，人性又多昧於貢已而明於責人的。那自以爲巳够「少年老成」者，那知很有對他不以爲然的人，正在訾　他「暮氣太深」；那自以爲已够「童心未失」者，又那知也有對他不能滿意的人，正在鄙夷他「稚氣太重」呢！</p>
<p>大概，歲數少的人總目覺得淺薄不足，對於一切事理物態都能感到新　和趣味的，歲月愈過，入世愈深，件件都經歷過來，明瞭得多了，才智也愈增愈備了；待到充足的年齡時，自然隨處能覺得和達到像「未下先知」的境界，幾非他自己往日意料所及了。俗稱那遠謀深算的人爲「老狐狸」，眞是一點不錯！年深月久所　的資格，自會狡獪多端，變化莫測，在若狐狸般的特點哩哩！不過，人對人問世的一切到多份熟習的時候，過去的歲月必已不少，未來的餘生也着實有限了。衰頹，龍鍾，會把你豐足勝人的才智漸歸作廢。上壽百歲又做了人生的止境，使你一世只够做了那時光的奴隸，發揮不到那裏去。不然，要是人生通常能活二百歲的話，豈不世上多了活仙人，那字宙之謎也不難打破了麼？</p>
<p>這麼看來，時光，眞是一個絕大的騙局，像大羅地網般的張着，等候入世的任何人鑽進去，上他，個老當，直至死而後已，這麼一件無聲無臭不可捉摸的東西，誰還能給他報復呢？人生，這沒能爲的東西，惟有悶聲低首，馴良臣服，受他謔至蹂躪而已！</p>
<p>那麼，時光是可詛咒的麼？不不！我只覺得時光是件最詼諧的東西——他是何等的滑稽呵！</p>

<h3>多和少</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>物以稀爲貴，中國的作家一向也抱定這個觀念的，顧炎武就是反對多作的一個，他說道。</p>
<p>「隋志載古人文集，西京惟劉向六卷，楊雄劉歆谷五卷，爲至多矣。他不過一卷二卷。而江左梁簡文帝至八十五卷，元帝至五十二卷，沈約至一百一卷，所謂雖多亦奚爲。」</p>
<p>這是什麽理由呢？因爲文不貴多，多則必不能工，他說道：</p>
<p>「二漢文人所著絕少，史于其傳末，每云所著凡若干篇，惟董仲舒至百三十篇，而其餘不過五六十篇，或十數篇，或三四篇。史之錄其數，蓋稱之，非少之也。乃今人著作，則以多爲富。夫多則必不能工，卽工亦不必皆有用於世，其不傳宜矣。」</p>
<p>這種寗少毋濫的意見自然不能說不對，爲讀者着想，與其略涉不如精讀，故寗可出版的數量少，而不可不求每本出版的作品都有相當的價値，使讀者有所得益。可是在這裏不能不留心一點，我們不能忽略了現代與古代的時地相異，而劇認爲古代人的少作乃完全是精審鄭重的綠故，現代人之多作卻說必定是濫，必定是爲名爲利。顧炎武去今三百年，那時候的印刷術固然沒有現在的進步，故成書尙不易，若推而上之，去古愈近，書成尤難，這又不但關平印刷術一點，若因學術之尙未發達，研究材料之稀少，中西文化之尙未溝通，這些都是使文人不能多作的客觀限制。所以顧氏的意見，在原則上雖無可非議，但他因昧於時地觀念而舉出的前例，究不能作爲我們反對「粗製濫造」的標準。</p>
<p>再者，文人產量的多少，也不能作爲判斷價値的標準，多產未必就濫，少產未必就精，試以西歐名產作家而論，如托爾斯泰，左拉，巴爾扎克，大仲馬，杜斯托也夫斯基諸家，每人所產，何止百萬，然未必因其多產就减損他的文學價値，反之，一張十年雕琢成的楮集，也未必一定有多少藝術價値。</p>
<p>五四以來十六年間，我國出版界也曾經過幾翻的漲落，而以一九二八年到一九，三二年爲最活躍多產的時期，過此以後，因着社會經濟之墮落和某種特殊原因，出版界就完全沉入了墊眠狀態，到此刻已達到消沉的極點，文塲上已看不見新作的產生。但另一方面，靑年的求智欲是依然存在的，不過因了需要與購買力的矛盾，致使那需要成爲一種潛伏意識，不足以表現出來吧了。所以當此不健全的現狀下，我們權衡輕重，銖較利害，我以爲還是應該從提倡「多」的方面做去，暫時撇開那些淸客的高調爲是。</p>
<h3>名（上）</h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>米薔蝴先生走進一家書店，站在一個用兩條長凳四張木板搭成的雜誌攤前。攤上一順地擺滿了三行雜誌：紅封面的：綠封面的；黃封面的；白封面的；有的封面上畫着一根黃竹烟槍和一盞圓口玻璃罩的烟燈的，玻璃罩當中還有一點毛筆尖似的紅色火燄；有的則畫的是一個三脚香爐旁邊擺着一隻裝滿苦茶的古黃色方盃子的；……。但米薔蝴先生一手摸着頸子下的一條紫色領帶，把眼光向這上面掃的時候，却被一個印着兩乳峯起的裸體女人的封面吸住了。那女人的黑色鬆髮上面，橫橫地印着四個紅色仿宋字是：「滿新雜誌一。定睛一看，那女人的鼻尖上却有米大一點被挖破了的痕跡，現出紙底一點黃色，雖然沒有前天當這雜誌剛剛出版時他搶先買了的那一本好看，但他總覺得仍然美麗，漂亮，比這排列着的三行雜誌都特別出色。他仲出一隻手爪去，抓了一本來，捧在胸前。右手尖着兩根指　揭開封面，那排滿一行一行方　黑字的目錄就現了出來，尤其是那「小說欄，的第五行—</p>
<p>「她的心……米薔蝴」</p>
<p>道幾個字，又在他的眼前特別凸出。一不錯，這字很好看，這麼黑亮，光燙，方正，美麗。要是排在第一行，那就……」這一串意識忽然在他腦子里滑了過去，他的嘴角邊便閃出一個夢似的微笑。但他立刻驚覺，知道這攤千周圍還站着六七個人，於是赶快仲出上面的一排白牙齒，緊緊咬住下面的嘴唇皮，同時把雜誌捧到鼻尖來，向上翹起，遮完自己的臉。他决心翻出那一篇一她的心」的正文來了，剛剛仲出兩根指頭去夾着雜誌的下角的時候，忽然從右肩旁邊伸出一個頭戴灰呢博士帽的尖鼻子的小白臉來了，而且那尖鼻子上面的一對眼睛就在灼灼地對着米薔蝴先生丰上捧的目錄閃光。</p>
<p>「哪，你這，眞討厭！」米薔蝴先生臉色一沉，憤憤地這麼想，幾乎要拍的一聲把雜誌關上：但他的腦子里却立刻　閃出另一種思想來了，他的左掌就　然那麼地捧着雜誌，右手仲出的兩根指頭仍然夾着雜誌的下角，不翻它，並且還把</p>
<p>「她的心……米薔蝴」</p>
<p>這一行目錄斜過去一點，對正小白臉的眼睛，幾乎脫口地說出：「呵，你看！」但博士帽的小白臉却忽然向他肩後一退，不見了。他跟着掉過臉來，就看見灰博士帽經過他的背後，擠到他的左肩旁邊來了，而且伸出五根白手指就去翻着那壘「滿新雜誌」。米薔蝴先生很感興趣地，仍然在鼻尖前手捧那本雜誌，單把眼睛斜視下去，就看見五根白手指居然翻出標題着「她的心」的正文的一頁，那「米薔蝴」的一個仿宋的黑字又嚇然地出現在他的眼前。他的一顆心怔，便好像提到了喉頭。但那手指立刻又把那幾頁翻過去了，在另外一篇文章的挿畫那兒停了一會兒！是這樣的挿畫；一個腦後垂着長黑髮的女人，高鼻樑的臉孔朝上仰，兩條豐滿的手臂撐在背後的一條橫綫上，兩條豐滿的脚則斜挺向前，是個「人」字形似的雪白裸體。小白臉的眼睛脥兩脥，嘴角邊便閃出一個夢似的微笑。米薔蝴先生的嘴角也笑一下，剛要把臉掉開的時候，那手指却又翻回前面來了。一頁又一頁的翻過去。哪，再翻過去兩頁，又可以看見「她的心」「米薔蝴」了。他的一顆心又揑緊似的忽然提到喉頭。一頁翻過去了。哪，就只一頁了。把這頁翻過去，「她的心」「米薔蝴」的幾個字又要出現了。那手伸出的兩根白指頭在夾着那一頁的下角了，下角揚起一點來了，那「薔蝴」的兩個字都可以看見了。那兩根指頭動一下。哪，就要揭開了。但是那手指却忽然一下不動了。他於是把眼光從那手指移了上來看灰博士帽下面的眼請。可是這眼睛却沒有看着自己手指夾着的雜誌，却在向着門口那方，看見一個麻臉的，身穿一件翻黃了的黑色長袍的朋友正甩動着兩手走了進來。「唉唉，今天又碰着這老土，准又要被他　借總毛錢去！」博士帽的小白險想，趕快從「滿新雜誌」上面縮回自已的手來，把臉掉開，便向着一列書架前面走去。他面向着書架上的書，從眼角梢望過去，就看見老王正走到他剛才站過的雜誌攤那兒，嘴唇笑嘻喀地，伸出右手的手爪對住那個頸前拖着一倏紫色領帶的人的右手。這紫色領帶的米薺蝴先生手不動地，皺皺兩眉遲疑了一下想，「這是誰？」但立刻他就記起來了，是前天剛認識的老王，他便嘴唇含笑地說道一聲：「哦！」把自己的右手爪就伸出去。</p>
<h3>明星</h3>
<p>— 張春橋</p>
<p>「又是預備去當明星！」</p>
<p>不然，葉先生預備作什麼呢。他胳膊斜搭在椅背上，手指間挾着支烟。烟絲靑靑地盪漾在空氣里。座位正對着窗口，從窗口光綫的明快，可以知道是個晴天，但時有雲彩　過。他抬頭瞅着白雲變換地流着，像淸新的河水里的沉澱物。在這樣美好的光綫下，他探身從桌子上取下那塊小玻璃鏡，向臉前一擺，就是一幅自己的影子。是的，很漂亮，濃黑的眉毛，準直的鼻子，勻稱的嘴唇，發紅的臉蛋，面孔不太大，嘴巴不大小，照下側面，也不難看。放下鏡子，仲仲胳膊，關節各各拉拉地發響。胸圍很大，僩子又是北方型的男子，…</p>
<p>「又是預備去當明星！」</p>
<p>坐在對面椅子上看報的朋友向他說。</p>
<p>他笑了一笑，感覺到不大好意思，腮上就添了一點紅彩。接着用一個動作鎮定住，向朋友說：「沒有什麼不可以！」</p>
<p>「你戲公映時，我一定捧塲！」另一位朋友說。</p>
<p>「謝謝吧！」他俯在窗口向下投射着幽閑的視綫。那是一個街市。</p>
<p>八月初的梧桐葉肥大的遮住了街心的陽光，行人已經穿上深色的衣服。已經是秋天了。因爲地方很偏僻，街上行人並不多。拾垃圾的孩子，正爭搶一個洋鐵筒。對樓的窗子關閉着，而且封了塵網，門口掛一張召租的鐵片。葉先生正注意着那上面的字，豁郎一聲，把他震動了。看時，行人都止住脚步，圍成一個圈子，圈子當中立住一個黃色衣服的巡捕，個子高高的，是一個山東大漢，立在他旁邊的到是一個年靑的小伙子。小伙子手揉着眼睛，淚和泥灰塗成黑眼圈，嘴裏嘟嚷着什麼。巡捕用短棒揮動，一脚蹄向他的屁股。人們的圈子向四周散了，小伙子　下腰，眼睛注視着巡捕的手和皮鞋，手慌忙地檢着潑滿地皮的大餅跟油條。檢完以後，被帶走了。人仍舊走各人的路。</p>
<p>葉先生看完這幕劇以後，僅只笑了笑。</p>
<p>「都市裏的小事」！他取過鏡子，剪刀，鉸下巴上的鬍髭。「電影上早就有這種事了。我要是……」</p>
<p>「當電影明星這是靑年的憧憬。但，明星不是這樣容易的。你只知道明星能出風頭，其實於其那樣，不如回到你家鄕看看水災的好。至少對於你生活的認識和偉大人格的修養是有莫大帮助的」。朋友停了停，「你要知道：許多靑年得到一點虛名而墮落下去的，例子是不勝其舉的」！說完，自己看自己的報紙。</p>
<p>葉先生把剪子微用力地向桌子上一丟：「又卉這個，幾天發講義」！一邊照鏡子，手得意地摸着下巴，心頭怪舒服地注視裏邊的漂亮的面容。剛要想一個明星面貌和自己比較，朋友又批評他：</p>
<p>「光是好臉盤子，僅能當個平凡人！明星的條件……」</p>
<p>「吊，又弄這個」！把鏡子一丟，下樓洗臉去了。</p>
<h3>歸來</h3>
<p>— 柳絮</p>
<p>我懷着一顆顫慄的心兒偷偷地歸來，</p>
<p>哦！錦綉河山已變成一條破爛的棉被。</p>
<p>不堪回首的故鄉呀！</p>
<p>於今只讓窮途的遊子來哭祭你潰爛的腐屍。</p>
<p>渤海之水載滿着哀怨，</p>
<p>河山負着創痛的傷痕。</p>
<p>問國魂何處？</p>
<p>唯有暮風伴着老殘的長城！</p>
<p>且鬆開深鎖的眉梢吧，弟兄！</p>
<p>把呻吟化作慷慨的歌聲，</p>
<p>莫忍辱而偷生；聚沉弱的羣力，</p>
<p>重整我們的舊山河！</p>
<h3>秋天里的信</h3>
<p>— 白兮</p>
<p>我說：朋友！人吃點苦頭倒是好的。如果住在大洋房里，彈彈批啊娜，唱唱美國好萊塢的電影名曲，唱到消魂失魄的時候，就向女人的胸懷里一倒，做起天堂里神童神女的風流韻事來，雖則快懷一時，然而一日被逐出天堂，到下界來做個凡人，那時候的痛苦窘狀，是實在比自殺還要痛苦上百倍。吃慣苦頭的咱們，雖然覺得苦頭的味兒是不會甜的，然而那種比自殺還要痛苦上百倍的痛苦是不會有的。——那是無疑的。</p>
<p>做人糊塗，雖然是不對的。像「做一日和尙撞一日鐘」，「今日有酒今日醉」，「得過且過」，諸如此類的「糊塗話」，有人却把牠們也解作「現實主義者」的話的，似乎有點說不過去。不過在某種點上糊塗一下，那倒也未始不是好的事。例如你信上的話：「幾乎像乞丐一樣了，秋風吹醒我，我才感覺到自己是一無所有」！在熱天被夏天的風吹着，就在担憂着秋天的風，或竟至冬天的風，而終日涕淚滂沱，逢人便設：「怎末辦哪？秋天快要來啦！啊啊！……」這是人家會覺到你是太可厭了！被夏天的風吹着的時候，就做夏天的事。秋天的風把你吹醒了，你覺得你自己一無所有，那未你就做做秋天里的工作吧！這樣動勤懇懇地做牠個一年，雖然吃了不少的苦頭，然而你的人格却因此而也偉大起來了。你不會大聲吼叫的喉嚨，也準會像獅虎一樣地吼叫起來了。——這，朋友！如果你覺得獅虎的吼叫是偉大的，那末你學會了牠們的吼叫，該是多麼値　你的驕傲呀！</p>
<p>在你的信里，想求我一點帮助，然而你的對象的我，却也被秋風吹醒了，也覺得自已一無所有。所幸的，自己還有一顆不曾被時代的瘴氣麻殺的血心，還跳着哩，跳得非常猛烈。</p>
<p>我們間無所謂「同情」，「同情」只會葬送一個靑年人的志氣。我們間只有在冷的時候，互相抱抱緊，學學獅虎的吼叫。——那倒或許會有一點甜頭嘗到的。</p>
<p>你要叫我答覆，就是這點。</p>

<p>— J.喬易斯作立波譯</p>
<p>波利是一個十九歲的繼弱的姑娘。她有輕柔的頭髮和圓圓的小口。當她和人家說話的時候，她的微帶錄色的灰色眼睛總喜歡仰望着，這使她像是一個小小的乖張的聖馬利亞的塑像。莫里太太起初把她的女兒送在一位毅物商人的寫字間充當打字員，但是，當她一個名譽不好的郡長的從人總是隔一天要到寫字間來一趟，要求允許和他的女兒說話的時候，她又呌回她的女兒，令她做家內的不作。波利對於使她可以自由接近靑年人的這個主意覺得非常快活。同時，靑年人也很高興覺到有一位年輕的女人，相距非遙。自然，洪利和靑年人常當調笑，可是莫里太太，她是一個慧眼的識者，知道靑年人不過是消磨時間：他們沒有一個是認眞的·這樣過了很久，於是莫里太太開始想着再把女兒送去打字，她看到了波利和個靑年中間有些異樣了。她監視他們兩個，默默地不露顏色。</p>
<p>波利知道她是被監視了，可是她的母親的繼續的沉默是不能誤測的。母女之間沒有坦白的　謀，沒有坦白的理解，雖然宿舍中人都在談論這事，莫里太太還是不加干涉。波利的態度已經有些奇怪，那靑年人顯然有些心亂了。終於，莫里太太認爲適當的瞬間已到，她干涉了。她處理道德的問題，好像屠刀處理肉片一般：在這種塲合她是胸有成竹的。</p>
<p>是初夏的一個明麗的禮拜天早上，有些熱意，却吹拂着新鮮的微風。寄宿舍的窗通通開了，花邊的帷幔在升起的窗框下徐徐地向　外鼓賬着。喬治敎堂的鐘樓上發出不斷的鐘聲，孤獨的或成羣的禮拜者們正橫過敎堂前面的小小空塲，他們的自抑的風采和他們戴　手套的手裏的小書，顯露了他們的目的。寄宿舍的早餐過了，餐室的桌上散滿了盤子，盤子上留着蛋黃的痕印和醃猪肥肉和肉皮的碎片。莫里太太坐在麥桿靠椅上，監視着僕人馬利收拾早餐的雜物。她要馬利把麵包的皮和碎片收集起來，留着滲　　拜二的麵包布丁裏。當桌子收拾淸楚了，碎麵包收集好了，白糖和牛油的冰箱也封鎖停當了的時候，她開始回想昨夜和波利的會談。事情像她所猜想的一樣：她的詢問是坦白的，波利的回答也是坦白的。當然，兩個人都有些不遜。她的不遜是　爲她不願意過於隨便地接受這消息，或者好像是默許了，波利的不遜不僅是因爲那總是惹她生氣的諷示，更因為她不願意　人猜想：在她的聰慧的天真裏，她看透了她的母親的寬恕背後的　向。</p>

<h3>天氣的驟變</h3>
<p>— 家為</p>
<p>今年的中秋佳節，眞太掃興啦！一位中年的朋友，從電影院里歸來，受了一身的風雨，太冷了：說他似乎從沒有記得以往的中秋節是有過這樣的。眞的，所謂「一年明月今宵多」，「月到中秋分外明」，「一半秋光此夕分」，更有「萬里無雲鏡九州，最團圓夜如中秋」等等的古人詩話，在今年那晚，非但無此良宵佳境，而且正是風吹雨打的悽凉之夜。尤其掃興的是，在上午日光融融的九十多度氣候之下，竟變成陰霾四起，風雨飄搖而溫度驟降到七十餘度的氣候了。而且到了昨日，最低的溫度竟只六十六度，眞是高下判若兩季了。這正將使人要咄咄稱怪的吧？</p>
<p>「天變了，什麼都變了」，時常聽見老年人對「世風日下」的當下要這樣嘆息着。不過，在退一步說，這話也言之成理的，世界與時代原沒有固凝着的，「一切都是動的」某大哲學家早就這樣說過了。何况，在今日這個「幾家歡樂幾家愁」的社會里，「大戶人家」正齊備着設筵祀嫦娥，團圓賞明月的當兒，有幾人再想到那哀鴻遍野的災區里，有成千萬無辜的災民，正在嗷嗷待哺呢？這樣，大槪自然界正為的是「天地為動」，風雨共愁」之故，所以一日里竟來了一個這樣大的「驟變」，作着「不平之鳴」—迷信之談，或者在這里可以借用一下吧？</p>
<p>不過，這驟變也並不偶然的，這原是東西氣壓高低的關係吧了，常謂「天有不測風雲」，也正有其前後因果在的。再就國際間的風雲來看吧，像最近鬧得人心皇皇的意阿之爭，時緊時弛，令人莫測。然要是我們能認識歷史，正規現實，那也就不難明白一切變態的本質。要知帝國主義者的「眞理」，是「解决人口過剩（？）僅有三種方法，一則將目前各大殖民所佔有之富源，重行分配，二則佔領目前尚未有人佔領之殖民地，三則向目前之殖民國家從事戰爭…」（見報載十三日哈瓦斯羅馬電「人民日報」載的評論）所以，所有國聯的開會，仲裁，英法的奔波，週旋，是為的什麼，也不難明白了—討價還價去解决他們的「人口過剩」吧？</p>
<p>總之，變，何論是漸變或驟變，都有牠們的起因與根據的，卽使牠是來得那樣的奇突，或至無聲無息。看吧，好在，牠這樣變的原因，一切事實都告訴我們一個明白了！</p>
<p>可是，「天變了，什麼都變了」！</p>

<h3>夜的河面</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>晚夏的天氣是那麼悶熱的，南方的大都市的馬路上透出來的瀝靑溶化的氣息，跟着海面飄來的風蕩漾着。然而，我是都市的咒咀者，我討厭在都市里過着那鬱悶而難過的生活。爲了這，我剛南歸，在都市里不過逗留了一天就得快快地踏上了歸鄕的船上，又開始河面的航行了。</p>
<p>離開了囂張而混雜的都市的堤岸，拖渡慢慢地向着靜寂的鄕村里航行着。——我愛在黃昏的暮色里旅行，沉靜的空氣所包圍着的大地上的一切，都是那麼悠然地向着黑而權威的夜色里爬行，我愛那西方的夕陽吐出來的血紅似的艶麗的色彩所反照着一片嫩紅的天空，問中是一幕蔚藍色的雲兒，這些好像太息着的美人在沉思着的情景。更可以煽起我的悒鬱的心情的浪蕩——流浪的年輕人就像一朶萍葉似地在海上飄泊的，不錯，這時候，我又帶着從老遠的地方所得到的自苦的痕跡，人生的慘傷歸來了</p>
<p>我愛在這樣的暮色里去想像我們的世界，人生上的一切都似乎沒有一點固定的，只不過是跟着狂風滾盪，跟着海水而飄流吧了。（當我看着海面的顫動的光彩的時侯，我就會這樣的想着。）</p>
<p>船依然在平靜的河面航行着，然而，當那暮色漸漸兒迷矇的時候，我的眼珠子也好像給一層輕飄的薄紗罩籠了一樣，什麼都看不淸楚的，只知道船在輕輕地移動着向前進行，江水的嘩啦嘩啦地響着，兩岸上的植物的影子，一堆一堆地在迷矇的的眼前榴了過去。</p>
<p>每一次向着鄉間的航綫歸去的時候，在船中總是那麼悒鬱而且難過的，不像在白天一樣可以在船的甲板上眺望那恬靜的景色，只能躲在艙里的小窗子前望着那廣漠而迷離的黑色的天空。黑色的天空沒有吿訴我什麼，黑色的河面也沒有吿訴我一種什麼可怕的恐怖。只是船艙里的賣藥的人們在張大了嘴巴的叫賣，什麼腰骨麻痺，什麼精神丸，什麼花柳病，一切的都是慣例地在吵雜着旅人的心頭，每一次，我都感到這樣的空氣是很難過而可怕的。然而，晚夏的熱的天氣，也不是那麼容易睡覺的。</p>
<p>不過，我自己無論是怎麼去排除自己的悒鬱和苦惱，無論怎麼的去抑制心情的顫動，那一切痛苦的影子都在煽動着。尤其是這一次忽忽的南歸，生活的痛苦到處都給我打擊着，一切的希望都變成了可怕的夢想，更令我感到前途的茫茫。就好像這一次的希望得到一個安靜的居所，然而，事實上和精神上比以前還要痛苦的。——流浪的入總怕永遠都是在旅途上流浪着的吧！</p>
<p>這樣，在艙里，在河面上，我的心情就好像沒有一條可以把握着的綫似的。生活的失望就增加我南行的苦惱了。而且更感到人生的路就像黑夜的河面一樣在爬行若，——永遠爬不完的艱險的路啊！</p>
<h3>北平速寫</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>大雜院</p>
<p>當你走到荒凉的城邊或是僻靜的小胡同裏，大抵總可以看見一些門漆剝落，屋宇傾斜的人家，這兒大都就是我們這里要談的大雜院。</p>
<p>由街門走進去，看到的就是一個又大又髒的土埕，址圾用具，小孩同畜牲佔有了所有的空間，腐爛的東西，人同畜牲的排洩物等等觸鼻欲嘔的氣味揚溢在這院落裏。就是這樣的地方是北平最大多數人的家，亦是他們在人世間唯一的安息處呵！</p>
<p>在土程的三面就是一些又小又矮的房子，每個房子就是一家。他們父母兄弟姊妹妻兒晚上就一起睏在那個大坑上。冬天夜裏，因爲日子太短了，屋裏亦許點着火燄小得像螢火　一樣的淸油燈。夜裏是陰森的，日裏是嘈雜的，這大雜院。</p>
<p>住在這裏的人大都是一些工人，小販，車夫，苦力或是叫賣者等等被剝奪的人們。天一吐亮，他們就爬下床出賣他們的氣力去了，小孩子亦成羣地在街上的灰土裏翻滾，打架或到垃圾堆去拾荒，全院落就是女人們的世界。正確說來不如說是老人們的世界，因爲這時日就是女人們亦爲着生活走出她們的街門來了。</p>
<p>太陽落山之後，拉着空車的爸爸在小孩們望眼欲穿中歸來了。被飢餓同疲倦蹂躪的爸爸實在再沒有餘力可以抱一抱，親一親他們。有飯時候大家默默地吃，沒飯時候，他打他的妻子，擰他的小孩，罵他的隣人，把社會給他的氣發洩在這些命運相同的人們身上。</p>
<p>冬天一到，這些掙扎在北風同冰雪裏的人們的日子是難以想像的。他們是那樣子希罕着熱氣呵！把房間的窗壁用碎紙補了又補，貼了又貼，再把從垃圾雄檢來的燒過的煤球，生火，小小的綠色的火苗在爐口閃動着，這小屋子是那樣的陰森，空氣又是那樣的惡濁，有時換，隔天醒來，一家都在煤氣中永遠安息了。</p>
<p>這裏的大姑娘沒褲子穿，整天躱在屋子裏，或是穿着自以爲挺漂亮的衣衫，黃昏時侯到街上去拍賣他的肉體；這裏的小孩早上給爸同娘帶出去後就永遠沒有回來；這裏的主婦們當丈夫發出了沉重的鼾聲時侯，正在爲生活絞着腦汁　，爲生活在傷心地哀哭着；這裏……</p>
<p>這大雜院就是他們的家，而這就是他們的「生活」！</p>
<p>灰士上駱駝</p>
<p>你讀過魯迅先生的「灰土」麼？北平就是這麼一座無日不在飛着灰土的古城·</p>
<p>北平的胡同差不多全是土路，平日脚踏的是比香爐裏的香灰還要深的灰塵·風定的時侯，一隻駛過去的汽車所蕩，起來的灰塵就像一面姻幕，把你捲入那黃色的雺中·刮風的日子它就來得更猖獗了，它鑽入你的毛孔，滲入你的嘴巴，混進了你的頭髮，把你弄成一個泥人。</p>
<p>就在這灰土瀰漫的街巷中，時常有一些碩大無朋的東西出現。它有着小小的頭，小小的眼睛，小小的耳朶，像蛇一樣的又星，又軟又彎曲的頸項，有隆起的雙峯同極長的腿子，這就是駱駝。它們是從塞外來的，悠長的旅途折磨了又鍜鍊了它，無情的風沙把它弄失了明。當街頭捲了一陣陣的風沙的時候，這一羣有着龐大的軀體的東西便使人家聯想了亞州的風暴伺蒙古的怒吼了。他抬着頭，運着力氣，舉起沉着的步子，一步一步地緩緩的走，雖然風沙把它的前鋒的足印掩上了，但他並不曾迷失了路途，它依舊向前走，向前走！</p>
<p>我以爲這就是北平這古城的象徵。北平雖然到處揚着風沙，飛着灰土，但它並不曾爲它所窒息，它像這駱駝，緩緩地一步走進一步。</p>
<p>雖然紆徐·終有達到光明的一天的。我咒詛，我又祝福它，這古城！</p>
<h3>暹羅和尚（海外風物誌）</h3>
<p>— 芳沁</p>
<p>暹羅的佛俗也說是：「佛門不管俗政，己但是和尙要比暹玉還高貴。佛門高於一切，暹王不只是管不及佛門，且常須去謁見所謂活佛，就敎於和尙。而凡王每見一切衣和尙衣的和尙，必以敬佛少禮見之；和尙却不用回禮，可坦然接受。這在暹羅歷史上有個故事記載着。故事是：王遇一小和尙，敬以佛禮，小和尙也惶恐回禮，於是這和尙便遭了殺戮。罪狀的意思是以爲王見穿和尙衣的和尙而和他行禮，乃如見佛；今和尙回禮，卽係妄屈佛與王行禮，便算增重王的罪孽。所以暹人眞是尊敬和尙如父母了。</p>
<p>因此，暹羅和尙的生活。就特別舒服。每家　人，經常的都習慣了自動買</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>辦許多食物供奉和尚，和尚菴寺，也得每天派和尚託鉢而出。所經之處，差不多沒有一家不放些東西給他。一些貴族，富人，以及暹王，又常佈置堂皇的宮殿，請高貴的和尚去講經，和尚的享受便格外豐富。</p>
<p>而有和別國很特異的；和尚可以娶妻，也頗別緻。普通和尚是可以隨意出入的，當一年三年，或十年，終身，都極自由。娶妻後當三年和尚再歸家，或者做了和尚回來娶妻，盡是平常習慣。</p>
<p>暹羅為徵兵制，而當過幾個月和尚的就可以免兵役。這又算是優待和尚之一了。有錢人想避免子弟當兵，便贈許多錢給某一和尚菴，使子弟去掛個和尚名。</p>
<p>談到和尚住所，更　不同了。大的就像王宮那樣建築得十分偉大輝煌。其尊嚴華貴，在暹羅境內，直較皇宮更給暹民敬仰，不下從前的羅馬敎皇的至高無上。這樣就無怪這種白吃飯的和尚，特別的多！</p>
<p>不過，和尚裏面也像社會的層次一樣，有着階級的嚴分，大致是分上中下三級，最上的是主敎的活佛之類。許多和尚寺內，設有似學校樣子的講壇，由裏面的大和尚登台講經，下級和尚就要經常聽講，算是一種功課，共中有的叫做「學徒和尚！」</p>
<p>至於生活更有兩樣。每個寺都有大和尚主持，一切收支歸他支配。捧鉢出去化緣的，不是每個和尚都可以那樣的，盡由大和尚分派。所以大和尚除了物質美滿外，要小和尚服待，再加上和家裏的三妻四妾叙叙。</p>
<p>所以暹人當和尚的分外多，就連異國人，以及華僑，在暹久住的，也有些當了暹羅和尚去。不過，這在暹人叫做「客和尚」，雖然優待，郤沒有本國和尚那麼尊貴。且總有些異樣的看法。</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>胡蝶的刺激</h3>
<p>我們這電影圈裏，就有許多刺激朋友，有些人找尋刺激，是為了要來麻醉自己苦悶的神經，有些人找尋刺激，也可以這麼說，他是要體騐生活，認識眞實的人間相，不是嗎？在各種刺激塲中，可以使我們看見許多五色繽紛喜怒哀樂的事情，常常歡樂的背後，是藏着憂患的，一個人受了重大的刺激，才能使他對人生有深刻的認識。胡蝶在「夜來香日」中，受盡了刺激，她被大少爺孫敏誘上了，但給固執的爸爸識破而被驅逐了出來，未幾快樂的時間飛過，她不幸給大少爺遺棄了，這時她只得又回到自己的家裏去，父親給氣得一命嗚呼了。在這幾重的刺激下使她明白了人生原來祇是欺騙呵！為了生活，祗得又每晚站在舞塲的門口呌賣「夜來香」。</p>
<p>有一天，她正在賣花，看見路邊停着一輛汽車，分明是大少爺孫敏帶着一個女人坐在裏面，她立時憤火中燒，拾起磚塊，將車窗玻璃擲壞，待她定眼一看，車中坐着的却並非孫敏，霎時闖了大禍，她給巡捕捉住了，唉！朋友，想想看，這是多大的刺激呵！</p>

<p>三·劇本時期</p>
<p>去年夏天，王天北緊緊揑住了「三個媳婦」的劇本，揮了一把汗說：「三個媳婦」至少也得是自己作品中最滿意的一部：」眼睛裏閃鑠着火花一樣，樣子有着極大的雄心創造一下，那時候正是劇本審查會贊美和提供意見的信剛接到，鼓動得他太興奮了，於是不避苦熱，立刻進行他的撮製工作。</p>
<p>四·演員支配</p>
<p>徐素貞學得需要作一次浪漫戲的嘗試，演一個交際之花，陳雁則是適合地演了一個雍容華貴的女子，新人白葉演的是賢淑的媳婦的典型，其他賀志剛，秦桐諸角色，都是在互相的笑意裏訂定了的，在「三個媳婦」裏你可以看見他們都如何地努力？</p>
<p>五·整個介紹</p>
<p>提示着一個嚴重的婦女問題，悲劇的構造，淡淡的散上一點喜劇的氣息，緊張，抽你的心靈沉沒在錢塘江口的怒濤裏，這裏有的是二個小時的刺激可以給你，這「三個媳婦」！</p>
<h3>應雲衛岳楓舌戰記</h3>
<p>— 靑雲</p>
<p>藝華公司的導演中，推「時勢英雄」的導演應雲衛與「花燭之夜」的導演岳楓兩位最善說話，最詼諧滑稽，他們能操縱你的情感，要你喜，你就得不自主的哈哈大笑，要你怒，你就得不自主的怒髪沖冠，要你哀，你就得不由自主的　　衣　　　　　　　你就得不自　的手舞足蹈，因此藝華同人對此兩公，無不表示好感。</p>
<p>兩公旣擅長這種「天賦獨厚」的特長，在工作的時間，導演演員演戲的時候，也能够正當的在演員們身上運用，而能得到很好的效果，譬如拍一幕喜劇的時候，演員們這時候正因有着悲痛的遭遇，而不能够笑，那麼兩公一施用這「特長」時，演員們的情感立被操縱，不由得破涕大笑了，這非作者「信口雌黃」有看過兩公導演戲的時候，可以做證人也。</p>
<p>言歸正傳，用言休絮，話說袁叢美導演的「暴風雨」聲片在公司試片之日，這都各有所長的兩公，亦在座參觀，應雲衛看到魏鶴齡發瘋一段，話匣子便開開了向岳楓挑釁：</p>
<p>老魏道一塲戲做得眞好，的是硬派戲，同尚冠武在我的「時勢英雄」裏一幕倒僵屍有異曲同工之妙，但是如果這段戲換了我們的硬派導演岳楓先生導演，一定更有可觀……」話未意，岳楓也不甘示弱：</p>
<p>「好了，同是一道的人，何必排擠，三句話未　，先替自己的片子宣傳起來」。</p>
<p>「稱你硬派導演，眞是再名符其實沒有，「中國海怒潮」，「逃亡」，這兩片誰敢說一聲不「硬」？新大作「花燭之夜」，當然也有硬的表演」，</p>
<p>兩公唇槍舌戰，你一句，我一旬，互不相讓，直至「暴風雨」停止演奏，兩公相對一笑，始駕返導演部，一幕額外妙戲，也就此告終。</p>
<h3>天一半逾間</h3>
<p>— 白芸</p>
<p>「海葬」LOCATION記</p>
<p>巨浪狂掀的大海里，飄浮着一個漁人的死屍，那人雖然是死去很久了，但是他的手上還緊緊抓着他的破魚綱不放；由此便可證明他是昨夜在風浪中為捕魚而犧牲的漁人。他那種凄慘恐怖的樣兒，使每一個人都掩面而不敢正視。祗有導演王斌，好像鐵石心腸似的，使那浮在水面上的死屍，受盡了他的支配，設若你留神他的面孔，眞是活像個閻王。</p>
<p>死屍是誰？誰裝的這個死屍！這倒是一件可貴的記載；他是王斌的朋友，這次天一攝影的工作，同時他還擔任「海葬」的塲記，他名字呌着梁雲庚，因為他善泅水的原故，所以要他飾演一個死屍；當他裝着死屍浮在海面的時候，誰也不相信他是個活人，那種逼眞的做樣兒，能够呌你流下眼淚來；所以在拍完這恐怖的一塲戲之後，王導演還這樣的慨嘆說：「唉！祗有阿梁才肯這樣犧牲，祗有我的阿梁才肯這樣吃苦，同時，也祇有他才有這種泅水的本領，假若眞眞換上一個田方或陳天國，恐怕他們早葬身魚腹了。」聽他說話的幾位，沒不動乎其中的嘆息着。</p>

<h3>「一九三六式」新車構造和式樣的預測</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>一九三五式汽車構造的精良。和式樣的新頴。我們已經儘量的欣賞過。在我們心目中。對於這種堅强和靈巧的引擎。極端流綫化的車身。和一切的一切。均已給我們以十二分的滿意。要作更進一步的改進。似乎是不可能的事情。但是。事實上絕對不會這樣。世界的汽車工程師。絕對不會以現在的成績爲滿足。在這一九三五年將要臨別的當兒。正在處心積慮地計劃他們的「一九三六式」新車。最近美國汽車製造專家史密司氏發表一篇關係「一九三六式」新車式樣和構造的論文。對於各部的改進和趨勢。言之頗詳。這實在是很有價値而同時很有興趣的一種計劃。用特分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）引擊構造的趨勢在一九三五式以前的汽車上。引擎的尺寸的設計。每視爲不重要的部分。其實這是極大的錯誤。尺寸笨大的引擊。非但不能增加馬力·同時足以消耗過量的金屬。直接使整個汽車的售價增高。這是最不經濟的·在一九三五式的汽車上。這種弊計已儘量除掉。因爲引擎的各部分已儘量的縮小。不但使成本减輕。抑且使發動機佔據地位减省。促成寬舒的車廂。但是在一九三五式的汽車上。工程師尙有二個不滿意的地方。就是（甲）高速率的困難。和（乙）低熱度時掣動的困難。這二個巨大的問題。預料將在「一九三六式」汽車上完全解决。</p>
<p>引擎高速率困難的焦點。就是因爲以前缺少適當的金屬和滑油。當引擎行駛過速時。活塞行動的次數很多。汽缸內部就會發生多量的熱。使金屬的溫度增加。而發生消蝕的作用。同時使滑油氣化。生成酸性化合物。更進一步的使汽缸受到侵蝕。使整個引擊蒙到損害。</p>
<p>經過了多次的試騐和研究。現在已有一種新的合金製造成功。這種合金不但可以抗拒高熱。同時可以不受酸性反應。不過這種合金的價値很貴。所以引擊的尺寸。比較一九三五式還要縮小。但是因爲速率的增加。對於馬力是絕對不會起影饗的。</p>
<p>低熱度時掣動的困難。每個駕駛者都已經騐過來。這因爲燃料發揮性的缺少和爆發制的遲鈍。現在這在試騐一種「一九三六式」的汽車燃料。內部包含高級的Butone將來採用後。定能把以前的弊病取消啊。</p>
<p>（二）車身的趨勢車身的長度。將作更進一步的伸展。這是無可疑義的。車廂至地面的距離。更將接近。車身的寬度。將漸成「卵形」。引擎可以放置在車首的最前端。足以便車廂的地位展開。同時。使重心適宜。</p>
<p>在一九三五式汽車上。雖然車身已儘量的「流綫化」。但是無謂的棱角。依然存在風洞試騐的結果。每每不能令人十二分的滿意。並且還有一種最壤的現像·就是各廠每藉「流綫」相號召。大都數是廣吿的性質·沒有眞實的效能。這實在是很不好的。所以。在現在設計「一九三六式」新車的當兒。工程師已規定一種標準的曲綫。以應用於「流綫」化的車身。這種曲綫有點像卵形。據風洞試騐的結果。有着驚人的成績。</p>
<p>鋼頂的車殼。在「一九三六」式汽車上將有更進一步的發展。因爲電桿的普遍。無縫的車殼將有最佳的成績。車身的顏色。將來大槪以土黃色和草綠色量受買主的歡迎。這都因爲一種自然的趨勢罷。</p>
<p>一切的附件。例如制動和掣動機。槓桿的作用。將更敏捷。大部的附件。將愈趨自動化。雷力的供給。因爲有更强的蓄電池和三極發電機。將更其充足·車前燈和車尾燈的控制將更來的容易。「不炫」而强烈的燈光。將在「一九三六式」新車上大吿成功。</p>
<p>總之。在「一九三六式」的新車上。我們將找到以前所忽略過的優點。更完美的構造。和更周密的設計啊。</p>
<h3>追記故都舉行之公共汽車經濟測騐</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>四項測騐均以道奇爲第一</p>
<p>今春北平市政當局。爲擬購備公共汽車底盤三十輛。供市上行駛之用。爰决舉行多次經濟測騐。以便决定究以選購何種底盤爲宜。按此種測騐。當然以比較汽油消耗量爲主。但當試騐之際。關於上坡能力。潤滑情形。以及是否平穩。與夫裝儎溫量時底盤與彈簧之反動力等等。亦均可由此覘及之。該項試騐哩程。約共三十英里。均屬平市境內。惟各種路面。實均已包括在內。察其用意。蓋欲藉此特別選定之道路。以使測騐結果彌極準確可靠也。</p>
<p>試騐時。平市當局代表。對於每輛車上所裝汽油若干。以及駛回以後賸油幾許。尤爲特別注意。所有與試各車之汽油箱。事前均先漏凈。使其不留滴油。然後以一定數量之汽車油。貯於其中。注入以後。且更複量一過。務使其完全相等。毫無差異。其手續之嚴密。檢騐之認眞。殊屬罕有。此其結果所以非常可靠也。</p>
<p>第一次測騐。係在三月三十一日下午舉行。與試底盤凡三輛。概係空車。並未裝儎重量。測騐結果。以道奇成續爲最佳。計用油二·一加侖。平均每加侖走一四·五英里。若其餘兩種底盤。一則用油二·七七二加侖。平均爲每加侖一〇·九英里。另一則用油二·八三六加侖。平均爲每加侖一〇·七英里。均不逮道奇遠甚。嗣復於四月二十二日。於同樣路程。作第二次測騐。所有與試各車。一律裝儎碎沙石子等六千磅。結果仍以道奇成績爲第一。計用油二加侖半。平均為每加侖一一·七英里。翌日舉行第三次測騐。與試底盤共計八種之多。結果冠軍仍屬道奇。計用油二·七二三加侖。平均爲每加侖一一·〇二英里，。此後因傳說某種底盤。曾經私人測騐。於同樣路上。作同樣測騐。成績亦殊不弱云云。當局爰爲愼重起見。特再作第四次最後測騐。所有與試各車。一律儎重八千磅。結果第一仍屬道奇。其成績爲用油二·六一五加侖。平均每加侖一一·四六英里。經此四度測騐以後。平市當局遂决意選購道奇底盤三十輛。蓋以道奇之效用宏偉可靠。與夫絕對經濟合算。固已彰明昭著。逈非一般車輛所可冀及也。</p>

<h3>American Ambassador Presented Credentials Yesterday; Chairman Lin and President Wang Hosted Banquets Separately; Various Yuan, Department, and Council Officials Were Invited to Accompany</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Johnson, the first American ambassador to China, went to the National Government at 11:30 am on the 17th to present his credentials to Chairman Lin. At 11:00 am, Mao Zhongfang, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the National Government, and Liu Naifan, Section Chief, went to the embassy in official cars to welcome the American ambassador, accompanied by the counselor and military attaché, totaling ten people. They were escorted by Mao, Liu, and others by car to the government. Military police were added along the way, all of whom paid their respects. Two rows of infantry lined both sides of the driveway inside the gate of the National Government, along with a military band. When the ambassador arrived, a bugle sounded a salute, and the American national anthem was played. Li Youchu and Song Jinye, staff members of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the National Government, and Lin Tongshi, Section Chief of the External Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, greeted him at the disembarkation point. Lu Chao, Chief Aide-de-Camp, greeted him at the bottom of the steps of the reception room and led him inside to rest. Soon, the Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies entered to inform the Chairman, who came out to the hall. Attendant civil and military officials were lined up on both sides in order. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the interpreter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stood to the right of the Chairman. The Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies invited the ambassador to enter. After the ambassador delivered his speech, the interpreter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs translated it into Chinese for the Chairman. After the translation, the American ambassador presented his credentials. After the Chairman received them, he handed them to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He then began to read his reply in Chinese and the interpreter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recited the translation. The Chairman shook hands with the American ambassador and spoke with him, with the interpreter relaying the words. The Chairman first inquired about the health of the American President. After a brief exchange, the ambassador introduced the embassy staff, and the Chairman shook hands with each of them. The ambassador and his staff left the hall and were led by the Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies into the reception room. At this time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Chief Secretary, and the Chief Aide-de-Camp also entered the reception room and mingled with the ambassador. The Chairman returned to his office to rest. The ambassador stayed at the government to participate in the luncheon. At noon, Chairman Lin hosted a banquet at the National Government for the American ambassador and his staff, inviting the presidents of the five Yuans and the heads of various ministries and councils to accompany him. The officials who attended included Dai Chuanxian, He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Jiahua, Ma Chaojun, Huang Musong, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Xu Mo, Liu Shishun, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Shengwu, Xu Jingzhi, Zhou Zhongliang, and Mao Zhongfang, Directors of the National Government Bureau.

The officials attending the banquet followed and took their seats in order. After the banquet, the Chairman took a photo with the ambassador and the officials attending the banquet in front of the corridor. They then went to the reception room for tea and cigarettes. After a short while, the Chairman first shook hands with the ambassador to say goodbye and returned to his office.

<p>(Nanjing) American Ambassador Johnson presented his credentials at the National Government on the 17th. The original texts of the speech and reply are as follows: (1) American Ambassador's speech: Mr. Chairman, tracing back to when I, the ambassador, personally came here to present my credentials as minister, it has been more than five years. Since then, I have strived to cooperate with the officials of your government to maintain the friendship between the two countries. I feel very pleased with this work. Our two governments have now decided to upgrade the level of their respective legations to embassies. I am very honored to have been specially appointed by the President of my country to represent my government as the first ambassador to the Republic of China. Today, I, the ambassador, personally come here to rededicate myself to the work of promoting and maintaining the principles of mutual and sympathetic understanding and friendship, hoping that these principles of friendship can continue to specially express the relationship between the people of our two countries. In addition to feeling honored by being selected for this position by my government, I, the ambassador, have a special interest in this position in China, because I first came to China in 1907 and have been stationed in China for a total of sixteen years. During these sixteen years, I have been stationed in several famous cities in your country and have also personally visited many of your country's major commercial centers and places of historical value. I feel extremely happy and have been given friendly treatment by the majority of the amiable and sociable people of your country. These ten years have been the most enjoyable time of my life, and I am amazed by all the reforms in both countries at that time. I am extremely honored to present to your esteemed Chairman the credentials of my country's President specially appointing me as the first ambassador to the Republic of China. (2) Chairman's reply: Mr. Ambassador, it is with great pleasure that I receive the credentials you personally present as the accredited ambassador by order of the President of your esteemed country. The mutual upgrading of diplomatic missions by the two governments is enough to consolidate the sincere friendship between China and the United States with your outstanding contributions as the American minister to China. I am especially pleased to receive you in person today. Furthermore, I am confident that the common interests of our two countries will be further enhanced by the selection of you as the ambassador by the President of your esteemed country. You have served in this country in your prime, with rich experience and have witnessed the important changes in our country's rapid development and have been in contact with our people from time to time. With such experience, the value of mutual and sympathetic understanding will be greatly increased. This is already a solid foundation for true friendship between any two great countries, such as yours and ours. Your Excellency's presence in this country will further strengthen the friendly relations between China and the United States. This is my sincere hope, and the National Government and I will sincerely assist in the realization of this expectation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<h3>Judicial Conference Held Second Meeting Yesterday Morning; 180 Proposals Distributed to Four Groups for Review; Tan Zhen Reported on Impressions of Judicial Inspection in Europe and America</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Judicial Conference held its second general meeting at 8:00 AM on the 17th. Ju Zheng, Tan Zhen, Wang Yongbin, Hong Ludong, Xie Guansheng, Zhang Zhiben, Xie Jian, and others attended, totaling 157 attendees and 27 observers. Chairman Tan Zhen, in addition to reporting on the transfer of items to other groups for review and reading the minutes of the first meeting, began the discussion. A total of 180 proposals were listed on the agenda of the second general meeting. It was decided to distribute them to various groups for preliminary review. Cases 1 to 49 were assigned to the first group, cases 50 to 107 to the second group, cases 108 to 142 to the third group, and cases 143 to 180 to the fourth group. Subsequently, Chairman Tan Zhen reported on his impressions of judicial inspection in Europe and America and the judicial conditions in various countries. He also proposed that after this conference, in order to continue improving the judiciary, a group of legal scholars from across the country should be gathered to form a legal research and improvement organization, so as to produce laws that meet the needs of the times and the people, such as the German Law Academy in Germany, which currently has 140,000 members and brings together all German lawyers in one academy to study laws suitable for their nation. Such legal academic organizations are extremely needed in our country. He made this suggestion for everyone's reference. Then, Zhang Jiyong, President of the High Court of Zhejiang, and Sui Yujun, President of the High Court of Hunan, were appointed to report on the judicial conditions in their respective provinces. The meeting was adjourned for a ten-minute break at 10:00 AM. At 10:10 AM, the meeting continued. At the proposal of Zhang Yuxun, Peng Yangguang, Wang Yongbin, and others, it was decided that due to the large number of proposals, in order to save time and engage in review work, the judicial conditions of each province would no longer need to be reported orally at the general meeting. Instead, the presidents of the high courts of each province could prepare written reports, distribute them to all members for reference, which was unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM. All four review groups immediately reconvened their second review meetings separately. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister Wang of the Judicial Administration Department personally visited the residences of the representatives at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday for interviews and discussions. According to his interview with Wang Qufei, the representative of Chizhi College, he said that the improvement of the judiciary should focus on the overall improvement. The so-called overall improvement should focus on judicial education and the training of good judges for the purpose of renewal, so that the entire system can be renewed. As for the current judges, they should not be arbitrarily changed. The training of young judges is still limited in number, and replacing old judges with old judges may not be better than keeping the status quo. Moreover, the duties of judges are very important, and frequent changes cause many inconveniences. Therefore, I am very cautious about the transfer of judges and do not want too many changes, which may cause disputes. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The representatives of the National Judicial Conference attended a banquet hosted by the Judicial Yuan at noon on the 17th. During the banquet, the representatives expressed great interest in the proposal made by Tan Zhen to organize a legal academic group. Sun Yuxun will draft a proposal and submit it to the third general meeting for discussion. The second and eighth review meetings were held at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM, respectively. All 384 proposals from the two general meetings can be reviewed. At 6:00 PM in the evening, the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, the Administrative Court, the Judges Training Institute, and the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office hosted a banquet for all members. The conference is scheduled to hold its third meeting at 8:00 AM on the 18th. The agenda has been drafted, including 66 proposals and the review reports of the four review groups. The review meetings will be held at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<h3>The Self-Awareness That the League of Nations Should Possess</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The current session of the League of Nations Assembly opened as the East African War was on the verge of breaking out. The League of Nations' life was hanging by a thread. Observers all hoped that the League of Nations could be self-aware and self-motivated, sweep away the accumulated ills of the past, and invigorate itself with a new spirit to cope with this difficult situation. In the past ten days, what the Assembly has shown has been both encouraging and disappointing. The reasons for the League of Nations' past weakness and inability to enforce orders are many, but the most obvious ones are: first, the lack of sincerity of member states in protecting the Covenant, with too little enthusiasm for the issue of sanctions; and second, the inability of the League of Nations to become globalized, with European countries controlling the Council and two or three major European powers controlling the right to speak for the European countries, turning this international league into a tool for two or three major European powers. All those who support the ideals of the League of Nations and the true spirit of the Covenant want to reform these two shortcomings. We deeply feel that the League of Nations' ability to survive and its value of survival depend on these two issues.</p>
<p>In the past, among the member states that expressed indifference to the League of Nations Covenant and unwillingness to participate in sanctions, the United Kingdom and its autonomous territories were the most prominent. The September 18th Incident caused the followers of Foreign Minister Simon to be slightly loyal to Geneva and to use the power of the British Navy and economy as a backup for the Covenant. Then, the outcome of the Far East War would not be what it is today. France was originally the leader in supporting the sanctions policy, and the Little Entente countries followed. However, France, seeing the unreliability of the British attitude, was also unwilling to take risks alone. The League of Nations Covenant had no power to back it up, so those who treated collective peace as worthless were able to act freely. Japan acted arbitrarily in the past, and Italy followed suit. In this League of Nations Assembly, the United Kingdom, with its own vested interests, rose up vigorously and was willing to be a loyal servant of the Covenant. France, seeing the wind change direction, then expressed its loyalty. The speeches of Hull and Laval opened a new path for the League of Nations. The Ethiopian countries all agreed. It seems that after this degree of expression, the first shortcoming of the League of Nations has the possibility of being reformed. This is what we consider optimistic.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the second weakness, the League of Nations has been particularly dismissive of Far Eastern relations. Among the fourteen current members of the Council, there is not a single Far Eastern country. Therefore, since the establishment of the League of Nations, the Chinese representative has always fought for a seat for China on the Council at every assembly. There are three types of Council members: permanent members, limited to Britain, France, and Russia; eight non-permanent members, elected by the Assembly every year, with strict geographical distribution. Between these two types is the semi-permanent member, which can be re-elected after the term expires. Poland and Spain are examples. Last year, when our country's term expired, we competed for re-election and lost. The Chinese people were pained by the fact that the countries controlling the League of Nations did not consider the rights of the 450 million people in the Far East. In this year's Assembly, our country's representatives made efforts in advance, hoping to obtain a seat as a non-permanent member. However, the election results yesterday showed that our country failed to be elected again. China pays huge fees to the League of Nations every year. The population, resources, history, and civilization of its country are not comparable to those of Poland, Spain, or Italy. Moreover, since the September 18th Incident, China has suffered appalling sacrifices due to its loyalty to the League of Nations. The technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China has made the relationship between Nanjing and Geneva increasingly close. However, the major powers have ignored this and brazenly disregarded the wishes of the Chinese people, making the League of Nations Council, which meets four times a year, without the right to speak for Chinese representatives. Its unfairness is extremely obvious.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters Held Important Meeting Yesterday; Discussed剿匪 Matters on the Great Wall Line</h3>

<h3>Multiple Bodies of Victims Discovered in Tianjin Concessions; Under Investigation in Major Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The authorities of the British, French, and Japanese concessions in Tianjin successively discovered seven male corpses who were kidnapped, strangled, and buried alive by bandits in Lixing Lane No. 18, Tongshan Lane No. 83, Liu Jia Laoma Store Lixing Lane No. 2, Zhuyuan Lane No. 13 of the French concession, Yongfeng Lane No. 12 of the Japanese concession, and Taichang Lane No. 6 of the Special District No. 1. The deaths were all tragic. The perpetrators in this case were already apprehended by the cooperation of the British and French Municipal Councils last week, including one female bandit, who is under interrogation. The bandits kidnapped their victims and had women lure them to the destination to kill them, and then sent letters to the victim's families to demand ransom. The reason for solving the case was that a British concession resident, Liu Zhihua, was kidnapped and strangled, and his family was ordered to prepare 30,000 yuan. When they contacted the police with a　lamp, they were detected by the detectives, who disguised themselves and ambushed the bandits. The bandits escaped into the green gauze tent. The British Municipal Council made every effort to investigate and finally solved the case last week. At that time, Liu Zhihua's body was found at No. 23 Zhuyuan Lane, French Concession, and the body of the manager of a firewood factory was found at No. 11 Qianhua Lane, Special District No. 1. According to the bandits' confession, seven murdered male tickets were discovered on the 17th. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Special Committee Meets to Consider Mediation of the Italo-Ethiopian Case Drafts Prepared and Repeatedly Revised Final Efforts to End the East African War Rumors of Contact Denied by Rome</h3>
<p>(Geneva) A phone call was received here today from overseas, stating that Italian and Ethiopian troops had already started fighting on the border of Ethiopia, causing great shock. But it was soon learned that this was not true, and the alarm subsided. Rome was the first to deny this rumor, but skepticism here is growing even more, because the draft prepared by the Committee of Five based on the Paris plan has reportedly been met with serious opposition from some members of the League of Nations Executive Council. The Committee of Five met at 10:30 this morning. The draft has been repeatedly revised, but it has not been studied in detail. It is scheduled to meet again this afternoon to discuss the unprecedented delimitation issues in the original plan. It is rumored that after the draft is prepared, it will be submitted to the representatives of both Italy and Ethiopia at the same time. The Paris Concorde newspaper telegraphed that the agreed-upon method would be verbally notified to the representatives of both parties to avoid leakage. At the same time, according to news from the Far East, the Italians are now withdrawing deposits from British banks. (Seventeenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council's Italo-Ethiopian Dispute Sub-Committee held a meeting at 10:30 this morning.

The sub-committee is scheduled to continue the meeting at 4:00 pm, hoping to produce a report and formulate a draft resolution, which will be distributed to the officials of both the Italian and Ethiopian delegations. Officials refuse to comment on the work of the committee, but well-informed sources believe that the report has a total of ten pages, the content of which is divided into three points: (1) A description of the Ethiopian government's repeated requests for assistance from the League of Nations and its willingness to implement all resolutions of the League of Nations; (2) A description of Italy's accusations against Ethiopia, saying that it has failed to fulfill all the obligations of a member state of the League of Nations; (3) The proposed solution should be based on the suggestions put forward by Britain and France at the Paris Three-Power Conference in August, which is to say, revise the border between Ethiopia and Italian colonies, reorganize the Ethiopian police, and hire technical advisors by Ethiopia, etc., while still respecting the sovereignty enjoyed by the Ethiopian Emperor. As for the reform plan that Ethiopia should carry out under the leadership of the League of Nations, Italy will assist to a greater extent than other countries. (Seventeenth Havas Dispatch)</p>

Thus, Italy can obtain a part of Ethiopian territory, and Ethiopia can obtain an outlet to the sea. (Seventeenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Naval Cooperation British and French Secret Talks Laval Returns to Geneva</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Secret British and French talks are rumored to be underway today. The issues discussed are cooperation between the two countries in all aspects, including naval issues. However, the British delegation denied the claim by the French news agency that Britain had proposed a joint economic blockade against Italy to France. As for the issue of naval cooperation, that is, patrols in the North Sea will be handled by France, so that Britain can concentrate its efforts to deal with the situation in the Mediterranean. At the same time, Laval is still trying to continue to find ways to prevent the League of Nations from collapsing due to the Italo-Ethiopian issue. Therefore, today he again had a secret talk with the chief representative of Italy, Alosi, for an hour. The content is unknown. (Seventeenth National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Statement Cannot Stop Using Troops Against Ethiopia No Conflict Between Britain and Italy</h3>
<p>(London) The Morning Post published today an interview with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini by its Rome correspondent. Mussolini said, "Our preparations in East Africa have cost 20 billion lire (approximately 33.5 million pounds). Do you think we are doing this for fun? No, we must move forward. It is too late to ask us to stop today." Mussolini absolutely does not believe that British-Italian friendship has lasted for centuries and will lead to war. He said that such an absurd thing will never happen. The reporter asked why Italy did not present its reasons earlier. Mussolini replied that Italy invited Britain on January 29 to consider an agreement to jointly develop British-Italian interests in Ethiopia. He was prepared to present his reasons, but the British Foreign Office responded evasively. Mussolini then said loudly, "Then there is only one way left. I will proceed." Italy consulted with Britain again on May 1 after the Stresa Conference, but the result of this proposal was still just unresolved talks. He was unmoved by proposals to redistribute raw materials or land concessions, regarding them as a distant and uncertain matter. He does not expect anyone to cede a part of his autonomous territory or colony to Italy. Now, even countries such as Portugal, Belgium, and the Netherlands all have fertile colonies. Why can't Italy have one? Mussolini concluded by saying, "Whether or not war will happen is not in Italy's hands, but in Ethiopia's and the League of Nations'." (Seventeenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Mussolini told a reporter from the Morning Post today, "Italy does not want to act in a hostile manner towards any European country, but if other countries take hostile actions against Italy, it will be equivalent to declaring war on Italy. At the same time, if counter-sanctions are taken against Italy, the result will inevitably cause the entire map of Europe to be completely reshaped. Italy and Britain have been friends for a long time, and Britain's territory is all over the world. Now, it is too much to not allow Italy to acquire a piece of land in Africa." Finally, he stated the strength and determination of Italy's material and spiritual power, and said that the country can easily summon 10 million combatants immediately.

<h3>England Wishes to Adhere Strictly to Treaties, Guaranteeing Peace in Central Europe: Draft Reply to France in Progress</h3>
<p>(London) French Ambassador Corbin previously inquired with the Foreign Office, stating, "Given the firm stance Britain has taken in Geneva regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, if Central Europe, especially Austria, were to be invaded in the future, would Britain take the same firm stance?" The Foreign Office is currently busy drafting a reply to this question. It is heard that the government does not intend to accept special agreements regarding any particular country, but is prepared to reiterate a passage from Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech at the League of Nations Assembly, namely, "Aggressive acts that may occur in any part of Europe should be strictly handled according to the League of Nations Covenant." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to Geneva dispatches received by "La Concorde", after the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, there is hope for a peaceful resolution: Italy is willing not to engage in warfare in Africa in exchange for Britain's undertaking to guarantee peace in Europe. Therefore, everything depends on Britain's response to France's inquiry regarding this matter. Everyone is eagerly awaiting Britain's reply. However, Italy still needs to curb Abyssinia's extravagant hopes, but is willing to achieve this through negotiations rather than resorting to force. Italy is most concerned about the Brenner Pass in Europe, located in the Tyrol province between Germany and Italy. Italy believes that only Britain's undertaking is worth making concessions in Africa. It also believes that if Britain hesitates to grant this undertaking, France will be able to provide Italy with full assistance in defending its European borders. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Assembly General Debate Ends, Lithuanian Representative Declares Faithful Fulfillment of International Obligations, Litvinov Shows Rhetorical Skill, Aims for Friendly Policy with Poland</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the League of Nations Assembly this afternoon, Lithuanian representative Foreign Minister Lozoraitis delivered a speech, stating, "The fundamental point of Lithuania's foreign policy is to respect all international constraints, and to strictly fulfill the constraints that have already been adopted, especially regarding the elections in the Memel region." He then mentioned a section of German Chancellor Hitler's speech in the Reichstag yesterday regarding Lithuania (note: Hitler said, "During this peaceful period, Lithuania openly seized the Memel region, disregarding the legislation of the League of Nations. Countless Germans in the Memel region have suffered. The League of Nations must quickly find a way to prevent the situation from becoming irredeemable."). He said that regarding the disputes in the Memel region, the Lithuanian government is prepared to handle them in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the treaty. However, various rumors from the German side are enough to disrupt the atmosphere of international cooperation. "It is regrettable that such rumors are often found to be untrue." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Polish representative Beck spoke, saying that Russian representative Litvinov had criticized the German-Polish non-aggression pact with obvious prejudice and arrogance on Saturday. The Russian representative rose to reply, but as soon as he began to speak, Beck left his seat and left the venue, not wanting to hear the Russian representative's reply. Litvinov said that Beck's remarks were unfounded, and that his objections did not involve Poland, nor did they mention Polish policy. The question of comparing bilateral pacts with collective systems should be openly discussed, as this is necessary for international cooperation. Russia is particularly careful to ensure that its foreign policy is understood by other countries. One of the main objectives of Russia's foreign policy is foreign friendship. For the sake of foreign friendship, Poland should also make its foreign policy known to other countries. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>After Litvinov finished speaking, Assembly President Beneš declared the general debate closed. The Assembly adjourned at 4:50 PM. The Assembly will not hold any more plenary sessions for at least a week, and the various committees will instead focus on their work. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital Authoritative sources here today interpreted German Chancellor Hitler's declaration in Nuremberg, saying that it is quite indicative of the danger of Lithuania being attacked by Germany at any time, and believe that Germany's resentment caused by the Memel issue may indeed lead to an attack on Lithuania.

<h3>Our Request for a Council Seat: League of Nations Indefinitely Delays Resolution</h3>
<p>(Geneva) China's request for the League of Nations Council to add a member to confer with that country on a certain issue has, after negotiations by all parties, been decided to be resolved indefinitely. Regarding this matter, the Secretariat of the League of Nations originally intended to suggest to the Council that a temporary member be added from this year to confer with China. Once Turkey, the current Asian non-permanent member, completes its term in 1937, China could fill the vacancy, and this seat would be changed to a semi-permanent nature. In other words, even if China completes its three-year term thereafter, it can still be elected for consecutive terms as a member. This proposal was explored by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to the large and small member states of the League of Nations, and the countries' intentions were rarely in favor. Finally, when the Council met, the representatives of the member states believed that the issue of allocating Council seats should be discussed in full, because when Portugal obtained a temporary membership in 1934, the Council had raised a reservation, saying that the issue of seat allocation should be discussed in full.

<h3>Roosevelt and Davis Discuss Navy and European Situation: Pessimistic About the Future</h3>
<p>Hyde Park, New York President Roosevelt discussed the general state of the Navy and its relationship to the current situation in Europe with Davis here today. Davis later told people that his discussion with President Roosevelt on the overall situation in Europe naturally did not mention US intervention. The United States has a moral obligation under the Kellogg-Briand Pact to help prevent war, and the United States is fulfilling this obligation. In terms of the foreign situation, the British government is in a leading position. When war is about to break out, there is little chance of a naval disarmament agreement being reached, but he hopes to have talks with British officials on maritime disarmament in a short period of time. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park, New York US envoy and disarmament expert Davis declared today after meeting with President Roosevelt that the hope of revising the naval treaty to replace the Washington and London treaties is very slim. It is heard that their discussion focused on naval issues, but also involved the situation between Italy and Abyssinia. Davis also said that with the European situation so tense, disarmament issues cannot be discussed. Britain has launched new negotiations, and partial agreements may be possible before a universal new treaty is established. However, Davis expressed pessimism about the prospects for disarmament and said that he would no longer go to Europe to discuss disarmament issues. All naval negotiations will be the responsibility of the State Department. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Navy has scheduled a meeting in late October to discuss personnel changes. The naval personnel changes before the critical year of 1936 are noteworthy, and the question of who will take office as commander of the Combined Fleet is particularly interesting. The commander of the Combined Fleet has traditionally served a two-year term, but now, due to the serious international situation, there is a strong opinion in favor of shortening the term. It is possible that the current commander, Vice Admiral Takahashi Sankichi, may be transferred. If so, the current commander of the Kure Naval District, Fujita Hisanori, and the commander of the Second Fleet, Vice Admiral Mine Mitsumasa, are the most likely successors.

<h3>Philippines Begins Presidential Election: Quezon Expected to Win</h3>
<p>Manila The prediction of Quezon's great victory has now become a reality. Voting began at 7:00 AM this morning and will end at 6:00 PM tonight. More than half of the reports from the districts of Manila have been received. The ratio of votes for Quezon in this city is three to one. It is now believed that the final count of votes for Quezon in the islands will be even greater than this. Quezon's competitors are prominent revolutionary leader Aguinaldo and Aglipay, a religious figure. The authorities have adopted extremely strict precautions, which have been very effective. Although rumors have been circulating outside that the radical party will attempt to strike and engage in disturbances, there have been no reports of any disturbances on the islands today. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Manila The Philippine Commonwealth government will be established on November 15th. The national election for its first president and vice president began this morning. Businesses across the country were closed today to facilitate voting. Voting will take place from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The authorities have firmly declared that the election will be clear and orderly, but in order to prevent disturbances, they have taken extremely strict precautions. There are three candidates vying for the presidency: Quezon, President of the Philippine Senate; Aguinaldo, a prominent revolutionary leader; and Aglipay, a bishop. Among these three, Quezon seems to have the best hope of obtaining a majority of the votes. According to the Philippine Constitution approved by President Roosevelt on March 23rd, the political system is republican, the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines is recognized, and Philippine officials are required to swear allegiance to the United States. The Philippine democratic republic will be formally established ten years after November 15th. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>German National Socialist Party Congress Closes, Grand Review of the National Defense Force, Hitler Personally Delivers Admonitions</h3>
<p>Nuremberg Chancellor Hitler addressed the German National Defense Force and 300,000 spectators at the closing ceremony of the National Socialist Party Congress today, stating that Germany's glory lies in its past armies. After a long period of rest, the past armies have now been resurrected. "You only need to maintain the heroic spirit of the past so that the country has something to rely on. Even if you do not seek other glories, the glory is already immense." At the same time, Hitler demanded that party members have absolute obedience to him, like the military. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers have detailed the German National Defense Force's exercises before Hitler yesterday. A reporter for "Le Journal" compared the German army's exercises this time with the recent exercises of the French army, saying that the German National Defense Force's nature and equipment are extremely sophisticated, but may not be superior to the French army. German soldiers seem to be more proficient and agile in the use of rifles, but this may not be the general situation, and perhaps only the most elite were selected to participate in the exercises. "Le Matin's" criticism of the German motorized army believes that the materials are practical, the structure is solid, and the engine power is extremely strong. The army uniforms are strong and beautiful. At the same time, attention was also paid to the people's cheers and their emotions of expressing unlimited respect for the army.

<h3>Hitler's Speech: Methods for Succession of Dictatorship, Training Leaders to Supply the Nation, the Leader Can Die but the Party Endures</h3>
<p>Nuremberg The National Socialist Party Congress closed tonight. Chancellor Hitler delivered a great speech, reviewing the aims, hopes, and functions of the National Socialist Party, predicting the relationship between the National Socialist Party and the state, and its guidance of the fate of the German nation in the future, which will be endless. Hitler said that the aim of the National Socialist Party is to make the German people unanimously support National Socialism, to make them all National Socialist Party members, and to entrust state affairs to outstanding party members. The acceptance of political power must be done gradually and must go through a long transition period. If National Socialism is not forced to abandon its mission, it will be intolerable to others. In other words, National Socialism will, in any case, insist on and implement its claims and decisions that it considers correct. Whoever wants to fulfill his historical mission must have a strong doctrine himself. "I do not know when I will die, but I know for sure that after I pass away, the Party will be able to survive and continue to lead the German nation." The strength or weakness of the people has nothing to do with it. The National Socialist Party guarantees the stability of Germany and its people, and maintains its leading position. The constitution of the new Germany is based on this solid foundation. Since the National Socialist Party is the spiritual and political trustee of Germany's destiny, it should supply the country with leaders. The army should also entrust its military power to the national leader appointed by this movement, because whoever is elected as the new leader will be the leader of the Party and the state, and the commander-in-chief of the National Defense Force. If such principles become the unshakable foundation of the state and the people, Germany will be able to safely weather all risks. "Now I am the leader of Germany, so I must offer a piece of advice: the leader can live or die, but Germany must endure forever. This movement will also lead Germany to immortality." After Hitler finished his speech, the applause at the meeting thundered for a long time. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Petroleum Law's Implementation Extended</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government held a cabinet meeting at 10:30 this morning. Prime Minister Okada and other ministers were present. Minister of the Navy Osumi reported on the tragedy of the cruiser "Ashigara." Minister of the Navy Osumi said that the tragedy occurred inside the turret, not in the entire ship, but 41 people were killed or injured, which he deeply regretted. The cause is under investigation. Minister of Commerce and Industry Machida said that the Petroleum Law was originally scheduled to be implemented on October 1st, but because foreign merchants opposed the obligation to store oil, it has been postponed until June next year. Minister of the Army Kawashima said that the number of righteous armies in North Manchuria has been reduced to one-tenth of what it was during the Rehe War. Minister of Colonial Affairs Kodama said that the armed immigrants in Jiamusi have achieved great results after the authorities encouraged marriage through photographs. Minister of Foreign Affairs Hirota reported that the future of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is difficult to predict, because Italy is Mussolini's dictatorship, and its trend is difficult to predict.

<h3>Impressions of a Southern Journey</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>(38) Interview with Huang Xuchu</p>
<p>Huang Xuchu, the Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, is a graduate of the Peiping Army University. He once held military command, showing bravery and skill in battle. Since assuming the chairmanship, he has vigorously advocated for clean governance. All expenditures exceeding fifty yuan from the provincial government must be personally signed by Huang to ensure prudence. Huang walks to the provincial government from his residence every morning. Although the provincial government provides a car, Huang rarely uses it. His wife personally manages the household affairs, going to the market before dawn. Such is their frugality. Therefore, the clarity of Guangxi's politics today is largely attributable to the leaders' practice of thrift. Huang is usually quiet and reserved, but when he speaks at banquets, he can deliver eloquent and persuasive speeches that resonate deeply with the audience. In managing finances, he lives within the means. Although the province's income is dwindling, he uses surpluses to offset deficits and manages effectively. Once expenditures are approved, they are always paid on time, without delay. Therefore, military, political, educational, and other affairs are thriving. When I was in Nanning, I visited the provincial government. The provincial government building is the newest in Nanning, adopting a consolidated office system. The offices are furnished like classrooms, with male and female staff working together. The offices of directors and section chiefs are also very simple, differing only in the smaller number of people. The messenger led me to the reception room on the second floor, which was furnished more luxuriously with sofas and Western-style furniture. Shortly, Huang appeared, also dressed in an ordinary gray cloth Zhongshan suit and cloth shoes, with slightly balding hair and a slender frame, lacking the imposing air of a military man. He answered only when asked, hesitating as if unable to speak. If I had met him elsewhere, I would hardly have recognized him as Huang Xuchu, the Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government. I (asked): What is the financial situation of Guangxi? How are military and political expenses allocated? (Answered): In recent years, Guangxi's total annual revenue has been around 27 million yuan. Military and political expenses account for about half. Detailed allocation is based entirely on the principle of living within our means. Sometimes, if administrative expenses increase, we find ways to reduce military expenses accordingly, so that income and expenditure balance. Therefore, we strive to be frugal in all matters. The remaining money is used for various construction projects. Although we live frugally in terms of material comforts, the morale of everyone, from top to bottom, is high. (Asked): I heard that the Chairman's salary is only 300 yuan per month. Is this true? How do you manage your living expenses? (Answered): My salary is indeed 300 yuan. Because we live a simple life, wearing cloth and eating vegetables, and have no other bad habits, money is of no use to us. Therefore, 300 yuan is enough. (Asked): What is the treatment of other public officials? (Answered): The treatment in the military and various provincial government departments is very frugal. Specialists and schoolteachers receive better treatment. The highest-paid specialists can earn five or six hundred yuan. The average monthly salary for middle school teachers is one hundred and several tens of yuan. (Asked): Guangxi's current financial management methods focus on reducing expenditure. Are there any plans to increase revenue? (Answered): Revenue generation plans, such as the development of mineral resources, the improvement and increase of agricultural products, and the breeding of forests and livestock, are all being actively planned, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. We can only take things slowly. (Asked): Does Guangxi welcome foreign investment? (Answered): We absolutely welcome it. In the past, many people came to negotiate loans and cooperative development of mineral resources, but none were successful, perhaps because Guangxi's transportation is inconvenient, so foreigners are not very enthusiastic about investing. Recently, an American businessman from Nanyang sent personnel to survey gold and tungsten mines, but there has been no official document so far. (Asked): How is Guangxi progressing with the implementation of universal basic education? (Answered): There is a six-year plan for universal basic education, with political force as the main driver and economic and social forces as supplements. It is planned that universal basic education will be generally completed throughout the province before July of the 28th year of the Republic of China, and then the power of universal basic education will be used to assist in the political, economic, cultural, and social construction of the province. However, some educators believe that economic and educational development should go hand in hand. In economically backward Guangxi, rapid implementation of universal education, with the economy unable to keep pace, leading to abnormal development, is not appropriate. (Asked): It is admirable that Guangxi completed over 30,000 li of roads in the shortest time and with the least expenditure by relying on the militia. However, the project was hastily done, and much of it is not up to academic standards, resulting in frequent repairs to the roads and bridges, which is not cost-effective. How will this be remedied in the future? (Answered): Guangxi is barren and the people are poor, and the economy is really too weak. Therefore, when building roads, we only sought rapid completion. It is undeniable that the project was hastily done. Today, the cost of repairs is indeed considerable and uneconomical. The poor suffer losses, and there is nothing we can do about it. We can only console ourselves with the four words "better than nothing." (Asked): What are the political measures in Guangxi regarding the Yao people? (Answered): The Yao areas in Guangxi account for about seven or eight counties, with a population of several hundred thousand. In the past, due to differences in language and customs, and because they lived deep in the mountains, they had very little contact with the Han people. At the same time, due to various forms of oppression by the Han people in history, they developed a psychological aversion to the Han people. Currently, Guangxi is implementing a policy of Yao-Han assimilation, selecting personnel who are familiar with the Yao situation to go deep into the Yao areas to propagate, offering kindness and righteousness, explaining the benefits and harms, and treating the Yao people with the most sincere attitude of absolute equality, so that the Yao people are happy and willing to submit, and naturally become close to us. In recent years, messengers have been traveling back and forth constantly, and Yao representatives also come here from time to time for sightseeing. The Yao areas are now divided into the nearby seven or eight counties for separate administration, and there are also village chiefs appointed by the Yao people. The training of the militia and the basic education are carried out in the same way as in ordinary villages, with Yao people as principals and teachers. Therefore, more and more Yao people understand the Han language, and contact with the Han people is increasing, and the feeling of hostility has been completely swept away. (Asked): Has there been any reform of the lower-level political organizations in Guangxi recently? (Answered): The lower-level political organization is, of course, based on the village unit. The orders of the provincial government are directly conveyed to the village chiefs, who are always ready to follow and handle them. Village chiefs can be sent to the province for training at any time. In the past, if the counties did not owe land taxes, the villages would have nothing to do. Now, the village chiefs are also responsible for militia training, basic education, health administration, and matters related to the development of the rural economy. The provincial government issues an order in the morning and a document in the evening, which is really very complicated. Village chiefs without considerable knowledge, physical strength, and training are absolutely not to be trusted. Therefore, almost all the village chiefs in the province are young people who have graduated from senior or junior high school and have received training. As for the treatment of village chiefs, it ranges from seven or eight yuan to fifteen yuan per month, which can be barely enough because the living standards in the villages are not high. In the future, we should find ways to improve their treatment. In the past, young people were unwilling to return to the countryside, mostly because of economic problems. If the living conditions can be adequately resolved, what is the difference between the city and the countryside? Currently, the political organization consists of counties below the province, districts below the counties, townships (towns) below the districts, villages (streets) below the townships, and jia below the villages, and households below the jia. In the future, it is planned to abolish the district organization, because the addition of a district adds an extra layer of bureaucracy to the transmission of official documents and orders, which delays a lot of time. After the district is abolished, the county government will be directly below the village, and the government's affairs will naturally be more convenient.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation of the Flood in Yun County, The Flood Relief Committee Is Fighting To Handle The Aftermath</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states: Yun County in Hubei Province is located amidst ten thousand mountains, crisscrossed by streams and rivers, with the Han River and the Du River flowing through it. Except for areas along the rivers, where some plains can be seen, they are only half a li or a li long. The rest is all ravines. Villagers live in thatched huts built against the mountains, tilling the land and burning the forests on the towering mountains. They work hard between storms and sunshine. However, from July 1st, torrential rains poured down for five days and nights without stopping. Suddenly, flash floods erupted, and the rivers overflowed, turning the world upside down. After several days and nights, the water began to recede. At this time, in the northwest two townships, officials were struck by heavy storms and hail, which uprooted trees and damaged homes. The crops were completely flattened, and many people and animals were killed. It was truly a catastrophe unprecedented in centuries. The Yun County Flood Relief Committee was hastily established and immediately began to provide food and relief. Coupled with the humid and hot weather and the ceaseless rain, the aftermath was even more worrying. They also had to actively carry out work such as patching up leaks and preventing epidemics. With countless problems and limited resources, they had to consider everything at once, which was quite a challenge. Most of the roads were submerged, and traffic was almost cut off. The disaster area was vast, and investigations took a long time, making them more difficult. Although it is not as vast as it used to be, there are still corpses everywhere and starving people all over the place. Those who survived are also living in the open air, without a home to return to. As for the grand buildings and pavilions, only broken bricks and ruins remain. Ancient tombs have become ponds. Even the newly built highway to Shaanxi, which was several hundred li long, involved nearly a million laborers, took nine months to complete, and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, has now been washed away by the flood, turning into ravines or cliffs. The difficulty of traveling is now comparable to the dangers of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. In terms of repairs, it would require several times the manpower and financial resources of the previous year to complete. As for the number of deaths of people and animals and the amount of property lost, it is almost impossible to calculate. The following is a brief description of the recent investigation.</p>
<p>Breaches of Dikes and Capture of the City: Yun County is originally a mountain city. In the Ming Dynasty, it was once the seat of the provincial government. The city walls were quite high and thick, and the east, west, and south sides were surrounded by the Han River. The banks had been repeatedly repaired and were very solid. Therefore, it had survived many floods. However, this time the rainfall was excessive. On the night of July 5th, the river overflowed and poured down, directly breaking through the southeast corner of the city. The water level was several feet higher than the city wall. By the morning of the 6th, the large dike outside the south gate was breached, flooding the city walls. Attempts to block it were ultimately ineffective. From the south gate to the east gate, about a hundred zhang of the city wall was submerged. On the morning of the 7th, over a zhang of the wall collapsed, and the river water poured in. The streets and houses in the southeast were all submerged. Fortunately, the north side was backed by mountains, and the people fled to the top of the mountain, avoiding being swallowed by the river. However, the torrential rain provided no shelter, and it was difficult to light a fire. The suffering can be imagined. Fortunately, the water receded sharply the next day, and the Flood Relief Committee was established on that day. Repair work also began on that day. Hundreds of workers were hired every day, and it took fifty days and thousands of dollars, but the work was still not completed. The extent of the damage can be imagined.</p>
<p>Landslides and Earth Cracks: The hinterland of Yunyang used to have many forests. In the past, although the floods were large, the trees were rooted and stable, so the impact was lighter. In recent years, however, the people have been unable to make a living due to continuous wars and droughts. Some have cut down trees to make a living, while others have stripped bark to stave off hunger. Reckless deforestation has turned the mountains into bare slopes. This time, the floods originated in the high mountains, carrying rocks and mud, eroding and impacting everything along the way. In many places, mountains were pierced and valleys were blocked. In particular, Mount Guabang in the south of the city, the large stone ridge in Xixiang Liaowa, were all steep cliffs over a hundred ren high. This time, they suddenly collapsed, and the nearby fields and houses were all submerged. In the east of the town, in Hujiawan, there was a plateau of more than ten mu, which sank into a pit several zhang deep, with water gushing upwards, making it impossible to approach. In addition, there are many cracks and sinkholes in fields, houses, villages, and markets. As the ancients said, "High banks become valleys, and deep valleys become hills." The vicissitudes of life are now being seen again, which is truly a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Destruction of Homes and Bankruptcy: Yun County has always been known as a poor area. The villagers are accustomed to simplicity, and most of their homes are mud walls and thatched roofs. This time, the flood spread throughout the county, and all the homes built against the mountains and along the rivers were destroyed. Moreover, it rained continuously in July and August, and it was impossible to build with mud. To this day, there are tens of thousands of people who have no home to return to. Mountain villages have very little fertile land. Some draw water from rivers and streams to build dikes and fields, while others build terraces on the mountainsides and cultivate the land. Now, the canals are blocked, the dikes have collapsed, the terraces have fallen, and the soil has flowed away. Flat fields have become gravelly areas, and mountain slopes have become barren land. It will take decades of siltation and soil cultivation before they can be cultivated again. Compared with the lower reaches of the plains, where the floods may submerge the land but the crops can still be planted after the water recedes, the loss is only for one season, which is worlds apart. Therefore, many wealthy farmers in Yun County have suddenly become penniless. With the surrounding areas being disaster areas and everyone feeling poor, how many people have lost their jobs, and how will they be resettled to avoid becoming vagrants? This is an extremely serious problem at the moment.</p>
<p>Lack of Food and Interrupted Cooking: Yun County has suffered from frequent floods and droughts for many years. The local bandits often disturb, so food has always been scarce. However, this spring, the military and political leaders strictly prohibited the planting of opium, so the wheat harvest was relatively good. This time, countless houses in the city and countryside were destroyed or collapsed. The food that was stored was completely lost. There are more than ten thousand families throughout the county who have been unable to cook for several days. The government has approved the distribution of grain from the original warehouses for emergency relief and has set up several porridge kitchens. Only one district in the city has a total of only two thousand households, and the refugees who have no home to return to, relying solely on porridge to survive, reach two thousand people every day. There are even fewer merchants in the four townships, so it is estimated that there are more than 70,000 households and no fewer than 10,000 people without food in the entire county. The amount of grain in the warehouse is limited, which is like pouring a cup of water on a cartload of burning firewood. Before the day is over, the supply will be exhausted. Soon, autumn will come, and those who cry from hunger will also be cold. Every time I think about it, I can't help but feel pain.</p>
<p>Dysentery Epidemic: Since the flood, floating corpses have been everywhere, and the river has filled the wells. Coupled with the humid and hot weather, everything is moldy and rotten, emitting a foul odor, breeding maggots and flies, which fill the sky. People are sleeping in the open air and eating cold food, which contributes to the spread of various germs, such as dysentery and cholera, throughout the county. Although officials and gentry, as well as Chinese and Western doctors, have been mobilized to carry out a cleanup campaign, provide medicine and treatment, and inject various preventive medicines and serums to those who are not yet sick in order to eradicate the disease and avoid the spread, the effects are still small due to limited resources. It is truly a case of misfortunes never coming singly.</p>
<p>In short, the people of Yun County are now in dire straits in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The disaster and panic are still in full swing. The Flood Relief Committee has requested the government to quickly allocate a large sum of money for relief and urgently hopes that all sectors will help with relief funds.</p>

Over thirty representatives from various provinces and cities attended, including Qin Kai, Niu Chuan'e, Huang Shiqiang, Lei Xun, and Wu Shirui. At 9:00 AM, they paid respects at the mausoleum, with Jiang Wanping presiding over the ceremony. Xi Yushu was also reportedly present. At 10:00 AM, the assembly commenced with an opening address by Chairman Xi Yushu. Representatives from the Central People’s Movement Committee, Director Liang from the Ministry of Industry, representatives from the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, and Representative Zhou from the Social Affairs Bureau delivered speeches filled with encouragement.

Subsequently, proposal review committees were designated, divided into two groups: Business and Legal. The Business Group included Wu Shirui, Lang Junwei, Wang Haifan, Shu Daoming, and Lei Yi, convened by Wu Shirui. The Legal Group included Niu Chuan'e, Wang Sifang, Xia Sunhuan, Tao Senjie, and Ye Zhaochang, convened by Niu Chuan'e.

<h3>Jiading: Farmers Fear Famine Due to Failed Autumn Harvest</h3>
<p>The cotton and rice crops in this county initially flourished during the summer, showing promising growth. However, since the onset of autumn, continuous wind and rain have caused unformed cotton bolls to fall off entirely, while the formed bolls lack sufficient sunlight to fluff, leading to extensive rot. Rice crops have either been infested by rice stem borers or flattened by strong winds, resulting in significant damage. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month, over a hundred farmers from Gusong and Gujing townships in the Fifth District, fearing a fruitless harvest, brought damaged cotton and rice to the county government in the city to appeal for famine relief. This nearly led to a conflict with the security guards. County Magistrate Xu eventually agreed to let representatives enter and received them, represented by Section Staff Zhang Delong. The representatives reported the severity of the damages and requested relief measures. Zhang promised to handle the matter and instructed them to return to their villages, providing each person with 60 cash coins as a token of support. They left immediately. On the morning of the 17th, Cai Bingzhang, the Section Chief of the County Government's Material Section, went to various townships to assess the damages.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Peng Guoyan to Appeal Again</h3>
<p>Peng Guoyan, the former magistrate of Pi County, was accused of excessive tax collection and bribery. The Zhenjiang District Court sentenced him to a fixed-term imprisonment of [blank] years and a fine of five thousand yuan. Peng refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. On the 17th, the High Court overturned the original verdict. Peng Guoyan was sentenced to one year and four months of fixed-term imprisonment for knowingly collecting taxes that should not have been levied, while he was found not guilty on the bribery charges. After the judgment, Peng Guoyan expressed his dissatisfaction and decided to file a third appeal.</p>
<h3>Construction Supervisors of Zhongshan Hall Accused</h3>
<p>The Zhongshan Hall in Yuanmiao Temple was built two years ago with donations totaling over ten thousand yuan. However, due to negligent construction, the main beam of the roof suddenly broke a few days ago, causing the roof to collapse unexpectedly and resulting in significant losses. Subsequently, the Zhongshan Hall Management Committee convened an emergency meeting, presided over by County Magistrate Wu of Wu County. It was decided that the contractor, Shen Xing's Construction Company, would be held responsible for the reconstruction. Meanwhile, Director Zhou of the Construction Bureau was instructed to plan the repair project. Following this incident, some donors believe that the Zhongshan Hall, a place revered by the people, suffered from such negligent construction that the supervisors, engineers, planning committee members, and contractor should all bear corresponding responsibilities. They should not solely hold the contractor responsible. They have filed a complaint with the Central Party Headquarters and the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting them to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and punish the responsible parties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Provincial Committee Mediates Zhenxin Dispute</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Zhenxin Yarn Factory in this county has dragged on and remains unresolved. The local Party and government authorities have reported the matter to the provincial authorities for resolution. It has been learned that after receiving the report, the Provincial Party Committee has dispatched staff member Guo Jun to Wuxi to investigate and discuss solutions with County Magistrate Wang and others. The factory's representatives are nowhere to be found, making the resolution difficult and the dispute has reached a standstill.</p>
<h3>County Government Plans to Establish County Warehouses</h3>
<p>The County Government of this county received an order from the provincial authorities to establish county warehouses. However, due to the lack of suitable locations and funds, the establishment was delayed. It has now been decided to establish the county warehouse in Sitou Town in the Fifth District, with a branch warehouse in Youjiatan. The annual operating expenses total 1,580.64 yuan. Apart from the estimated income of 1,318.50 yuan, there is a shortfall of 262.14 yuan. Additionally, the start-up costs of 828 yuan are also unfunded. Therefore, the matter was submitted to the political affairs meeting for discussion yesterday. It was decided to request the provincial authorities to allocate the unfunded amounts from the county's general contingency fund for the 24th year to facilitate the official opening.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Mediation of Rickshaw Rental Fails</h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers of Wu County went on strike due to the high rental fees. Following discussions at a Party meeting, it was decided to reduce the daily rental fee to 920 cash coins, which led to the resumption of work. Subsequently, the rickshaw owners argued that the losses were too significant and requested to levy 30 cents of silver dollar in rental, similar to Zhenjiang's approach. The County Government forwarded the request to the Construction Department for approval. However, the rickshaw pullers were unwilling to accept this and repeatedly requested that the rental fee be maintained at 920 cash coins. The conflict between the rickshaw owners and pullers remained unresolved. The County Government instructed Xu Baoguang, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Lin Jun, the District Chief of the First District, to mediate. After several rounds of negotiations, a mediation meeting was held at the Public Security Bureau on the 16th. Representatives from the rickshaw owners, including Xi Shuping and others, and representatives from the rickshaw pullers, including Han Zinan and others, attended. Chief Xu explained the benefits and drawbacks, urging both parties to quickly find a solution to ensure the safety and convenience of merchants and travelers. However, the rickshaw owners insisted on the rental fee approved by the Construction Department, while the rickshaw pullers requested that the daily rental fee be maintained at 920 cash coins, leading to a standstill. After three hours of waiting, no results were achieved, and the meeting adjourned. It is reported that Chief Xu and District Chief Lin intend to report the mediation situation to the County Government and discuss the decision-making process further during the upcoming Party and government meeting.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Second Phase of Huai River Diversion to Begin on Schedule</h3>
<p>The provincial government convened a meeting on the 15th, bringing together the magistrates of the counties along the canal related to the Huai River diversion project, as well as Director Xu of the Huai River Engineering Office, to discuss the progress of the second phase of the project. The meeting has concluded, and all participants have returned to their respective counties. Regarding the principles of proceeding with the labor recruitment, it is learned that the provincial government has set a target of recruiting 160,000 to 200,000 laborers, with a deadline of the end of this month to complete the recruitment and bring all laborers to the construction site. The large-scale construction will commence on October [blank]th, and the engineering aspect is scheduled to be fully completed by the end of April next year. All unfinished projects from the previous phase will also be fully completed during the second phase.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Clash Between Tax Police and Villagers in Jizhen</h3>
<p>A conflict erupted between the tax police in Jizhen and the villagers of Gongdi Township due to an investigation. The police opened fire, killing villagers Shao An and others, sparking an uproar. The case has been transferred to the judiciary for review and is scheduled for investigation on [blank]th. In addition to summoning the villagers and police officers present at the scene, District Chief Yi Ziqi will also be questioned.</p>

<h3>Sino-Burmese Boundary Commission: Our Representatives Depart This Morning, Proceeding in Accordance with the Mission Outlined by Both Parties to Facilitate Final Resolution by the Two Governments</h3>
<p>The Chinese members of the Sino-British-Burmese Boundary Commission, Liang Yu-Gao, Yin Mingde, and their entourage, boarded the Dollar Line's President Jefferson last night and set sail this morning for Yunnan. Liang and Yin met with reporters yesterday morning to discuss their mission. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Concentration of Personnel: The Chinese members of the Sino-British-Burmese Boundary Commission and the staff of their office, numbering one thousand, assembled in Shanghai on the 16th. They purchased tickets from the Dollar Line and boarded the company's small ferry from the Xinguang Wharf at 10 PM last night to board the President Jefferson, which set sail from Shanghai at 3 AM this morning. After arriving in Hong Kong, they will proceed to Yunnan via [blank] Fang, expecting to arrive in early December. They will meet the British representatives and the neutral chairman appointed by the League of Nations at the agreed-upon location of "Hu Suan."</p>
<p>Boundary Disputes:</p>
<p>In order to clarify their mission to all sectors, Chinese representatives Liang Zi Gao and Yin Mingde met with reporters at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road at 11 AM yesterday morning. Yin stated that the Sino-Burmese border is divided into northern and southern sections. The northern section, around Pianma, was resolved by officials during the Qing Dynasty. The southern section, around Pan Hong, was surveyed and demarcated by representatives from both governments between the 20th and 23rd years of the Guangxu reign, and a treaty was signed. However, disputes arose during a joint survey conducted by representatives in the 25th year of Guangxu, leading to delays and unresolved issues to this day. Recently, the Pan Hong issue arose, leading both parties to exchange documents on April 29th, agreeing to form a boundary commission. The commission, composed of two representatives each from China and Britain, and a neutral chairman appointed by the League of Nations, will travel to the southern border of Yunnan and Burma to conduct on-site surveys in order to thoroughly resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Thorough Survey:</p>
<p>The two representatives further stated in a written statement that all accommodation equipment, food, tents, and other supplies for the Chinese side during the survey of the southern border of Yunnan and Burma must be purchased new in Shanghai.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Sends Representative to the Netherlands to Promote Sino-Dutch Trade: The Overseas Trade Association will Host a Banquet for Commissioner Hou Tonight and Invite Minister Chen Gongbo to Give Instructions</h3>
<p>Since the visit of Mr. Hart, the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Dutch East Indies, the friendship between China and the Netherlands has grown stronger, and commodity trade has also flourished. Recently, the Ministry of Industry received a telegram from the Consul General in Batavia stating that the Dutch East Indies government has decided to organize a Sino-Dutch Trade Committee. The Chinese community in the Dutch East Indies also intends to organize a special committee of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies to promote Sino-Dutch trade. Both parties will cooperate to develop the overall trade between China and the Netherlands. At the same time, the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies telegraphed the Ministry of Industry requesting to send experts to the Netherlands to reside permanently, participate in meetings, and preside over all matters. After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Industry considered the matter to be of great importance to the development of overseas trade and ordered the International Trade Bureau to select a commissioner to go. It is learned that the International Trade Bureau has appointed Mr. Hou Houji, the statistics commissioner of the bureau, to go. Mr. Hou believes that in order to preside over Sino-Dutch trade, it is necessary to investigate and consult on the detailed situation of major domestic factories and import and export firms. He has sent a letter to the Chinese Industrial Overseas Trade Association, informing all members and factories to facilitate the process.

<h3>Miscellaneous Grain Merchants Firmly Oppose Bran Tax, Visited Huang Yesterday to Request Mediation, Industrial Federation Telegraphed Guangdong Requesting Repeal, Gu Xin Yi and Others to Petition in Guangdong in a Few Days</h3>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that since the implementation of the joint shutdown and suspension of transport by oil cake and miscellaneous grain merchants, a petition delegation has been organized to visit various ministries and commissions in the central government in Beijing, together with representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Guangdong provincial authorities to abolish the bran tax. However, the Guangdong authorities have not yet made a clear statement. The various Hunan factory guilds have reported the situation to the Chinese General Federation of Industry and requested assistance. After accepting the request, the federation dispatched Commissioner Qian Chengxu, and invited Zheng Zenan, the supervisor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Gu Xinyi, the chairman of the Miscellaneous Grain Guild, and Chen Ziyi, the standing committee member of the Oil Mill Trade Association, to visit Mr. Huang Jilu, a central committee member who came to Shanghai from Guangdong, to mediate and restore the economic relationship between the two parties as soon as possible. Mr. Huang expressed his acceptance and telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for consultation. It is believed that there will be a turning point in the future.</p>
<p>Promoting Wang Zhisheng to visit Chen in Guangdong: According to the reporter of Da Gong News Agency, Wang Zhisheng, the employer representative of the Chinese delegation to the International Labor Conference, will take advantage of his trip to the Singapore National Exhibition to transit through Guangdong and visit Chen Jitang, the chairman of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, to discuss the withdrawal of the ban. Mr. Wang will take the British Steamship Company's Ranpura steamship to [blank], and representatives of the oil cake and miscellaneous grain merchants will also depart for Guangdong to file a petition within a few days.</p>
<p>Industrial Federation Petitioned for Repeal: Guo Shun, the chairman of the Chinese General Federation of Industry, submitted a letter to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of Guangdong requesting the repeal of the bran tax. The original text is as follows: "Letter for the purpose of requesting the cancellation of the bran surtax, requesting your approval and examination. Our association received letters from member oil mills and factories, and from branches in Wujin, Suzhou, and other places on September 6th and 8th, respectively. They stated that Guangdong recently levied a surtax on bran to finance the construction of Zhongshan University, causing oil merchants in various places to strike and disrupting manufacturers' production and workers' employment. The situation is extremely serious. We request that our association forward the situation to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for relief to maintain industry and benefit farmers. We have learned that the oil cake produced in various parts of our country is mostly used by farmers for fertilizing their fields because it contains a large amount of nitrogen. It is suitable for the southern climate. Therefore, Guangdong province accounts for more than 63% of the total output in the country. It is conceivable how important it is to China's agricultural policy. In recent years, foreign chemical fertilizers have been rampant in the country, with high quality, low prices, and great effectiveness. According to the principles and experiments of modern agronomy, they could have long ago taken the place of natural fertilizers. However, natural fertilizers still exist and have not been replaced by chemical fertilizers because soil fertilizer is still cheaper than foreign fertilizer in terms of value, and its use has been a habit for thousands of years, so farmers are reluctant to give it up. Now, if a surtax is levied on soil fertilizer, it is tantamount to directly increasing the selling price of soil fertilizer and expanding the market for foreign fertilizer, harming merchants and farmers alike. In the opinion of our association, the local government should reduce or even exempt taxes on Chinese products that still have a place for consumption to maintain the livelihood of farmers and resist the import of foreign goods. Unexpectedly, at a time when various places are vigorously advocating the abolition of excessive taxes, the Guangdong Provincial Government has contracted the surtax on all bran to merchants and companies, with a tax of up to 25 cents per load of cake. On the one hand, it is cutting off the livelihood of oil mill workers, and on the other hand, it is increasing the burden on Guangdong farmers. Weighing the pros and cons, production and sales are both unfavorable. For this reason, we are writing to your association, informing the Guangdong Provincial Government to cancel the surtax as soon as possible so that merchants in various places can resume transportation as before and restore the economic relations between the two parties, which would be a great benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government Ordered the Department of Finance to Handle: The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association received a document from the Guangdong Provincial Government, Cai Zi No. 4697, stating: "One telegram, still the Guangdong province's tax merchants contracting the collection of bran surcharges, harming excessive miscellaneous [taxes], please maintain the case and strictly order the repeal, by the Shi telegram [known]. It has been found that this case was previously telegraphed by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and others requesting the repeal, and the Department of Finance was ordered to handle it accordingly. Now, according to the previous situation, the Department is hereby ordered to expedite the investigation and handle the matter together. This batch, September 7th, 24th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Lin Yunhai."</p>

The counties of Tongfeng, Pi, and Pei in Northern Jiangsu have been affected by floods, and the recent impact of the severe wind and rain on the evening of the 11th has caused the breaches in Tong, Pi, and Pei counties to worsen.

<p>Pi County Appeals for Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, located on Yunnan Road in this city, received a letter yesterday from the Public Funds and Public Property Management Office and other groups in Pi County, which stated: "To the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disaster Relief in Various Provinces: In view of the recent Yellow River flooding, the dikes of the Yunhe (Grand Canal) and Bulao River and the newly built dikes have successively collapsed, causing areas 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to be submerged. Looking around, the waves surge everywhere. Villages, huts, food, clothing, livestock, and utensils are all collapsing and sinking in the great flood. The number of disaster victims is approximately 300,000, and the disaster area covers two-thirds of the entire county. The severity of the disaster can be said to be unprecedented. Before the collapse, the people were busy building dikes and had no time to prepare for family matters. When the sudden torrent arrived, they could only help the young and flee to higher ground in a hurry. All their belongings were difficult to take care of. Those who survived have no clothes or food, and their cries of sorrow are heart-rending. The newspapers have briefly reported on this situation, and we trust that you are already aware of it. Pi County has suffered from banditry for years, and the people have been living in misery. Now that the banditry has just subsided, the floods have come again. Alas, our people, how can they endure it? However, even though Heaven has sent down such a great calamity, can humanity do nothing to save them? However, even though Pi County is making every effort to raise funds for relief, it is still a drop in the bucket, and the breach in the upper reaches has not yet been blocked, so the flood continues to rise. The future is long, and it will be difficult to sustain. We believe that your association's purpose is to relieve disasters, and you have compassion for those who are hungry and drowning. Therefore, we are telegraphed to inform you of the disaster situation in our county and request that you promptly allocate relief funds to comfort the disaster victims. We are impatiently awaiting your orders." Signed by Liu Maokai, Director of the Public Funds and Public Property Management Office of Pi County; Liu Chengbing, Chief Secretary of the County Farmers' Association; Zhang Hongen, Standing Secretary of the County Education Association; Liang Fanwu, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce; Wu Shuyun, Standing Director of the County Women's Association; Jiao Yingong, Director of the Relief Institute; Liu Gaotang, Director of the Zhonghe Town Public Education Center; and Chen Huaying, Director of the Fangshang Township Public Education Center.

However, a long time has passed, and there has been no indication of any use of these union fees. This indefinite management not only places a heavy burden on the management committee but also deviates greatly from the original purpose of the management. In the future, as time goes on and personnel changes occur, there may be criticism. Colleagues of the railway are concerned that there is no need for permanent storage and have proposed to transfer all of the $1,000 union fees to aid water disaster relief, demonstrating the past public spirit, humanitarian assistance, and spirit of universal love of the colleagues of the railway. All union fees will be transferred to aid disaster relief, which is admirable. It is reported that these union fees will soon be submitted to the special party headquarters of the two railways and then to the central government for distribution.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Instructions on Doubts Regarding Sticking Stamps on Allocation Lists and Other Documents</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent separate letters of reply and instruction to resolve questions related to the sticking of stamp tax on the third copy of invoices and allocation slips. The original letters are as follows:</p>
<p>Third Copy of Invoices</p>
<p>Reply to Lei Hua Water Factory from the Morning Council: Dear Sir/Madam, on the 16th of this month, we received your letter inquiring about the matter of affixing stamp tax, along with multiple autumn order forms. Our reply is as follows: (1) For the third copy of invoices, the copy given to the customer should have the stamp tax affixed by your factory. The copy used as a receipt is a receipt for the goods and should have the stamp tax affixed by the customer receiving the goods. The third copy, which is only a duplicate for verification purposes, does not need to have the stamp tax affixed according to Article 3, Item 7 of the Stamp Tax Law and Article 3 of the Implementation Rules. (2) The customer's order form should have a stamp tax of 2 cents affixed per sheet by the person issuing the order form, according to Article 16, Item 2 of the Stamp Tax Law, for any item priced at 3 dollars or more. (3) For notification slips, since the upper left corner already states "receipt provided separately", based on the circumstances, it is not a document given to the customer for payment as described in Article 16, Item 3 of the Stamp Tax Law. Furthermore, the left corner also has the words "Check for errors frequently". Based on its nature, it should be used for checking whether there are errors in the accounts. According to Article 5 of the Implementation Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, if the name is corrected to a "Verification List", it will not be necessary to affix the stamp tax.</p>
<p>Allocation List</p>
<p>The association also replied to Minfeng Industrial Raw Material Company stating that on the 16th of this month, we received your letter inquiring about two points regarding stamp tax. Our reply is as follows: (1) The allocation list used for collecting goods externally is a document for collecting goods as described in Article 16, Item 5 of the Stamp Tax Law. For any item priced at 3 dollars or more, a stamp tax of 2 cents should be affixed per sheet. Although the allocation list has never specified the price of the goods, your company should be aware of the approximate price of the allocated items. You can determine whether or not to affix the stamp tax based on these standards. In order to avoid misunderstandings by inspectors in the future, it is recommended that you add a "Price" column to the allocation list in the future to clarify matters. (2) According to Article 12 of the Implementation Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, various tickets and forms that should be subject to stamp tax, if bound in a booklet format, should be affixed with stamp tax per item before use or delivery. In addition, it is not necessary to affix stamp tax on the cover of the booklet. Therefore, since stamp tax is already affixed on each sheet on the receipt, it is not necessary to affix it on the booklet again. (3) The receipt is another name for the receipt. The responsibility for affixing the stamp tax should be borne by the person issuing the document, as stipulated in the "Responsible Taxpayer" column of the Stamp Tax Law tax rate table. Therefore, to avoid complications, your company prints blank receipts, that is, blank receipts, for customer use. This blank receipt is printed by your company on behalf of the customer, which is similar to a printing company printing blank receipts on behalf of someone else. It can only become a receipt after the customer has received the payment and goods and has stamped or signed it. Otherwise, it is just a blank piece of paper. Therefore, since the person issuing the document is the customer who receives the payment and goods, the responsibility for affixing the stamp tax to each receipt should be borne by the customer and should not be borne by your company.</p>
<h3>Indian Nationals Grieved by the Motherland's Earthquake, Donate Funds to Aid Victims of Quetta Disaster</h3>

<h3>Construction Committee Borrows 500,000 Yuan in Materials from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the National Government's Construction Committee, in order to purchase additional power generation equipment for the Capital Electric Plant, to add equipment to the Electrical Testing Laboratory, and to renovate buildings, borrowed 37,000 pounds in materials and 35,000 yuan in cash from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Custody Committee. Furthermore, the Huainan Railway is scheduled to be completed and open to traffic by the end of the year. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Borrowing Funds to Expand the Capital Electric Plant</p>
<p>In order to expand the Capital Electric Plant and increase power generation equipment to supply electricity to surrounding towns such as Longtan, the committee borrowed 36,000 pounds in materials from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Custody Committee. At the same time, in order to renovate the committee's Electrical Testing Laboratory at Xihua Gate in the capital and add various equipment, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors resolved to hand it over to the finance and technology groups for review. Each pound is calculated at thirteen yuan in national currency, totaling approximately 500,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Huainan Railway to Be Completed by Year's End</p>
<p>The committee issued 6 million yuan in electrical business public bonds in 1933, using them as collateral to borrow 3 million yuan from a syndicate composed of ten banks including the Bank of Communications, to build the Huainan heavy-rail railway and add various machinery and equipment to the Huainan Coal Mine. The Huainan Railway has now been built to Chaoxian County. Its starting point is the Huainan Coal Mine, passing through various stations: Kongdian, Shuijiahu, Zhugang, Tangji, Luoji, Dunjiji, Hefei, Cuozhen, Qiaotouji, Jiongchanghe, Zhonghu. As for the earthwork from Chaoxian County to Yuxi Town (i.e., the terminus), it has been completed and the track laying has begun. It is expected to be completed and open to traffic by the end of this year. It was also decided to build coal docks at Wuhu Jiang Yuxi Ji and purchase two cargo ships specifically for coal transportation.</p>
<h3>Eighty Batches of Stranded Overseas Chinese Return to Shanghai from Japan</h3>
<p>Lin Guisheng and Eight Others Return Home on the Tsukuba Maru; Six Among Them Took the Haiyan Steamer Yesterday Evening</p>
<p>The eightieth batch of overseas Chinese compatriots forced to return from Japan, including Lin Guisheng, Hu Zhengchang, He Yinchang, Hu Zhibiao, Xu Chengjun, Zhou Yunjing, Zhou Shixiang, and Zhu Caizhong, arrived in Shanghai on the 16th aboard the NYK Tsukuba Maru, which docked at the Huishan Wharf. After disembarking, they temporarily stayed at the Laogongxin and Xingongxin Inns on the 16th Pier. Except for Lin Guisheng and Xu Chengjun, who held documents from the directly affiliated branch of the Chinese Kuomintang in Tokyo and went directly to Nanjing, the rest were registered by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and sent back to their original hometowns at half price after their identities were clarified. It is reported that six of the overseas Chinese compatriots took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan steamer last night to return to Wenzhou to seek a living.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Asks the Public Works Department to Pay Attention to the Guaranteed Interest Rate of Telephone Services, Allowing Telephone Experts to Research the Scope</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Settlement sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, making further statements on expanding the research scope of telephone experts. The original letter stated: "To the Director, We previously sent a letter on September 6th, requesting your council to expand the research scope of telephone experts in three areas, which we believe you have already noticed and implemented. We hereby solemnly declare to your council that if this research scope is not expanded, this association will not consider the research report satisfactory to the wishes of telephone users, and there is room for further consideration on this. We must ask your council to pay special attention to this, and respond with a letter for your review. Attached are three items for expanding the research scope: (1) The guaranteed interest rate of the world's telephone business and the guaranteed interest rate of the Shanghai Telephone Company here are far apart. Is it reasonable for the Shanghai Telephone Company's six-percent reserve fund and two-percent combined into one share of guaranteed interest? Otherwise, propose a guaranteed interest rate that you consider reasonable. (2) Should the business income fee (4.5 percent), the material purchase commission (5 percent), and its income tax be outside of business expenses? (3) Is there a way to avoid losses from exchange rate changes? Whose fault is it, and should it be compensated by the public?"</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Merchants Petition Anhui to Exempt Tea Taxes, Claiming Treatment Is Too Unequal Compared to Cooperatives</h3>
<p>According to Chen Yizhou, a supervisor of the Shanghai Foreign Dressed Tea Merchants' Association, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency reported yesterday that Qimen boxed tea in Anhui Province has always been subject to a tax of four yuan per lot. In the past few years, although tea merchants' businesses were sluggish, they could still maintain themselves. In recent years, the export of Chinese tea has become even more exhausted, and tea merchants have been hit repeatedly, losing money year after year. However, the taxes in Anhui Province have not been exempted or reduced. Therefore, all tea merchants have petitioned the Anhui Provincial Government based on the orders issued by the Ministry of Finance, stating that all unreasonable taxes and miscellaneous levies on exported goods should be eliminated. However, months have passed and there has been no reply. At the same time, the Qimen Tea Cooperative also requested exemption from tea taxes, and the Anhui Provincial Government agreed to a five-year exemption. This is too unequal. Therefore, Qimen tea merchants are currently determined to request tax exemption from Anhui Province, and they will not stop until their goal is achieved. Chen continued, "Even if the Qimen Tea Cooperative is slightly different from the Qimen tea merchants in terms of organization, their goal of buying and selling on behalf of customers is the same. Furthermore, both the cooperative and the tea merchants are stores registered and permitted by the same government. From this point of view, it is too unfair that the cooperative and the tea merchants have to bear an additional four yuan in tea tax due to the difference in name."</p>
<h3>Contents of the Public Works Department Meat Market's Refrigeration Equipment</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Health Office recently built a meat market and refrigeration plant at the corner of Dixiwei Road and Zhaqin Road, next to the Public Works Department's Slaughterhouse. The construction of the building has now been completed and accepted for use by the Health Office. Here is a brief record of its contents: The building is a two-story steel-concrete structure. Entering from Dixiwei Road, one goes directly to the cargo yard, and then exits from Zhaqin Road. The bottom floor is mostly a refrigeration room, with a loading platform and seats in the open space, as well as a machine room and public office. The refrigeration room is divided into two major sections, with different temperatures. The section with the lower temperature, between 30 and 35 degrees Fahrenheit, is for storage periods of up to four weeks, with a capacity of 680,000 pounds. The section with the lower temperature, between 15 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit, is for storing meat for more than four weeks, with a total capacity of 170,000 pounds. The above two sections are further divided into several small rooms, each with its own specific use and separate storage. The second floor is a meat sales market, with 72 meat stalls, each occupying 40 square feet. Each stall can hang ten or so slaughtered livestock of various sizes, with a total of 864 animals in the entire market, approximately double the number of animals slaughtered daily last year. At one end is the inspector's office, and at the other end is another refrigeration room. The temperature of this refrigeration room is approximately between 30 and 35 degrees Fahrenheit, and is specifically for meat that is no more than one week old, with a capacity of 71,000 pounds. Therefore, the total capacity of the refrigeration rooms in this area is 911,000 pounds. The third floor is used as a place for butchers to change clothes, shower, and relieve themselves, as well as a machine room, etc. Furthermore, the upper and lower floors of this building and the adjacent slaughterhouse have overhead transportation equipment for communication, using electricity and gravity as power, making transportation convenient. All transfers are done without manual labor, both for convenience and for hygiene.</p>

<h3>Yi Fangshuo Case Concluded; Sentencing Set for the 21st</h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a comedic playwright from Hangzhou, was previously arrested and prosecuted by the Second Special Court for rape of his cousin and disruption of public morals. The plaintiff withdrew the charges, but he was also involved in restricting freedom and monitoring the actions of female performers in his home. He was sentenced to three years in prison. He appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After the trial, the sentence was changed to enslavement of others and the three-year prison sentence was upheld. Yi was not satisfied and filed a third appeal with the Basic High Court. Now, the Basic High Court has revoked the original judgment and sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for a retrial. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:30, the Third Branch of the High Court, consisting of judges Sun Honglin, Li Changnian, and Wang Yue, together with prosecutor Dong Qiming, specially opened the Third Criminal Court for trial. Judge Sun served as the presiding judge. Lawyer Fei Xizhen appeared in court on behalf of the Police Affairs Department. Yi's defense lawyer was also present to await instructions. The court ordered the appellant Yi Fangshuo to be brought to the case, first asking for his age and origin, and then asking for the reasons for appealing the judgment. Then, regarding Yi's enslavement of others, he was asked whether there was any inhuman treatment. Yi claimed that the female performers in his home were all relatives and friends who were sent to him to learn to perform, entrusted by their families to prevent them from going out, fearing unexpected harm, and that there was no enslavement or abuse. He requested an investigation. The rest of his statements were the same as those made in the previous two trials. Witnesses were also summoned and questioned. The court believed that the facts of the case were clear and ordered the beginning of the debate. First, the prosecutor stated his opinion, mainly that according to the results of the trial, the appellant's sentence could be reduced. Then, the lawyer for the Police Affairs Department and Yi's defense lawyer debated each other. At the end of the debate, the court scheduled the sentencing for the 21st. Yi was returned to the detention center to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Seize Property; Forced Marriage as a Comedy; Father Remarries and Has a Son; Two Daughters Have Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>Xi Futang, a local resident living at 10 Chenjiamen, Qichangzhan, Pudong, is engaged in the dock business and owns four dock boats and a five-room residence with land, possessing modest assets. After his first wife passed away, he left behind two daughters. The eldest daughter, Lin Gen, had already taken Cao as her son-in-law. The second daughter, Lin Bao (i.e., Yu Ying), had studied at Junyi Middle School in Shanghai and is now 20 years old and not yet betrothed. However, because Xi lacked someone to serve him, he remarried a certain woman last year, which aroused strong opposition from his two daughters, and family conflicts arose from time to time. Seeing that she was no match for them, the woman moved to Yangjing. This year, she gave birth to a son. The two daughters, fearing that the woman's son would inevitably lead to disputes over property division in the future, and that their sister would be isolated after Lin Bao's marriage, decided to strike first. Without consulting Xi, they secretly hired a matchmaker to find another son-in-law for Lin Bao to strengthen their position. Shen Lansheng and his wife Shen Chenshi learned of this and volunteered to introduce their relative Shen Ruiting to the door. Shen works as a surveyor in a certain agency in the city. After both parties agreed on the marriage arrangement, they chose the day before yesterday at noon for the matchmaker to hire a sedan chair to carry Shen to Xi's house, along with four tables of banquets, firecrackers, incense candles, and other items, to prepare for the wedding with Lin Bao. However, the secret was leaked, and Xi Futang had already heard about it. He rushed to his residence that day to resist. When he saw the matchmaker, the groom, and others swarming in, Xi argued that his daughter was not yet of legal age and that his consent should have been obtained beforehand for this marriage to be legal. He argued that Shen and others had arranged this secret marriage, violating criminal law, so he slammed the door shut and sent someone to report to the Qichangzhan police station. Seeing that the situation had changed, the matchmaker forced Shen Ruiting to the side door. Just as Shen's cousin A Bing arrived and dragged Shen and others out, the police arrived and took both parties to the station for questioning. After the earnest persuasion of relatives and friends, they were first instructed to return home and then discuss the matter. The police station agreed. However, Xi Futang was still furious after leaving the station.</p>
<h3>Purchased Cows Left for Fostering on a Farm; Went to Check and There Were No Cows; Yuan Yuan Farm's He Fusang et al. Sued</h3>
<p>He Fusang, Chairman and Manager of Yuan Yuan Farm, and Chen Liting, Standing Director, have recently been sued in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court by Huang Ainong, Gu Shoubai, Fang Luqin, etc., who hired lawyers on charges of fraud, forgery of documents, and misuse of checks. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. He Fusang claimed to be ill and did not attend. Only Chen Liting and his lawyer attended the court. Huang Ainong testified that, introduced by He Fusang, he invested in shares, totaling 200 yuan in foreign currency, and purchased cows to be raised on the farm, holding a registration book. Later, he deposited 2,000 yuan in the farm, also holding a deposit book. Later, when he went to retrieve the cows, he was unable to do so because the registration book did not have a number. However, after investigation, it was indeed his cows. When the deposit was withdrawn, He Fusang issued a check for 2,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank, which was not honored upon maturity. After negotiation, he agreed to repay in installments and Chen Liting guaranteed it, but he failed to fulfill the contract. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit. Gu Shoubai testified that he and Fang Luqin purchased three cows from Yuan Yuan Farm at a price of 960 yuan per cow and also left them for fostering at Yuan Yuan Farm, holding a deposit book with numbers on it. The milk yield of the cows was calculated at seven pounds per yuan, and He issued settlement slips. He also took out insurance for 1,000 yuan on his behalf, but there is no cow insurance available in Shanghai, so he felt suspicious. When he went to the farm to investigate, he could not find the cows with the numbers on his deposit book, which was clearly fraud. The milk yield settlement slips he had heard about daily were forged because there were no cows. Chen Liting testified that he worked at Jin Cheng Bank and was friends with He Fusang. He invested 100,000 yuan in Yuan Yuan Farm and served as a director. The farm's capital was initially 250,000 yuan and was increased to 500,000 yuan last autumn. He had full authority over business operations, and he did not advise on anything other than board meetings. As for Huang Ainong's allegations, He Fusang said that they were private loans, not deposits, because the company never accepted deposits. Although he guaranteed the loan, Huang did not seek it from He, who was in Shanghai, but instead sought it from him, so he did not pay it. His tenure as a standing director was from July 1 to August 10 of this year. He was completely unaware of the plaintiff's allegations and needed to ask He Fusang to clarify. Judge Jiang verified the statements and ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Qianjiatang Last Night; One Thief Intercepted by Detectives; A Handgun Found; It Belonged to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhao Rongmao, a 24-year-old local from Shengqing Lane, 105 Wujialong, Qianjiatang, French Concession, runs a Yushun cigarette and paper store. At 10:30 PM on the 16th, three robbers suddenly arrived, holding a handgun, threatening to make a noise. They robbed him of 27 yuan in silver dollars and fled. Afterwards, the victim reported to the French Concession police for arrest. After getting the loot, the robbers fled in all directions. The robber fled to Xujiahui Road and was met by Inspector Jiang Futian of the French Concession Police, along with detectives Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, and detective Liu Jinrong, who were on patrol. Seeing that the robber looked flustered, they immediately stopped him for questioning. The robber stammered. A Browning handgun with six rounds, and two flashlights were found on his body. He was taken back to the police station. The robber confessed his name as Fei Jinan, 29 years old, from Anhui. He admitted that he had just robbed the Yushun cigarette and paper store in Qianjiatang with two other accomplices who were at large. The detectives inspected the recovered handgun and found the number 153301 of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, which showed that the gun had been seized from a police officer of the Public Security Bureau. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Xiong Yiping questioned him.

The court verified the report, questioned the defendant Fei Jinan, and then ordered that the case be adjourned for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Mortgage Dispute: Lawyer Accused of Fraud Due to Poor Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Jin Youmei, also known as Jin Hongji, a local resident residing at No. 24 Wengjia Lane, Ximennei, and a lawyer, owned a registered land deed No. 1197 in the French Concession, behind the Shanghai Funeral Home on Talas Road, measuring 7.751 mu, and another plot of 0.561 mu. The total value was estimated to be nearly 400,000 gold yuan. He mortgaged it to China United Assurance Company for 200,000 silver yuan to build the Fuli New Village 洋房 on the land. A mortgage construction contract was signed, stipulating that the rent collected after the houses were completed and rented out would be used as interest payments. On January 16th of this year, Zhang Zhiliang, the owner of the Xinsheng Construction Factory on Songshan Road, borrowed 5,000 silver yuan from Jing Tiansheng (61 years old), a Shaoxing native residing at No. 170 West Aihamus Road, and signed a contract using another contract as collateral, with a six-month redemption period. It was also stipulated that 500 yuan of the monthly payments from China United Assurance Company, as stated in Article 6 of the mortgage contract with China United Assurance Company, would be used as a guarantee. It was further noted that if the repayment was not made on time, Jing Tiansheng could directly collect the monthly payment of 500 yuan from China United Assurance Company. Subsequently, due to poor market conditions, Jin failed to repay the loan on time. The creditor sent a letter to China United Assurance Company, claiming the right to receive the monthly 500 yuan. In response, China United Assurance Company replied that Jin Youmei had also mortgaged 24,000 silver yuan on April 24th of the previous year, using the benefits from the first mortgage as collateral. Only after the principal and interest of the first and second mortgages were cleared could the third creditor claim their rights. At this point, Jing Tiansheng believed that Jin Youmei had stated that the China United Assurance Company's payment benefits would be used as collateral when borrowing the money, without mentioning the second mortgage with China United Assurance Company. Considering Jin's actions to be fraudulent, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Court's Criminal Division, accusing Jin Youmei of fraud under Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and also filed a civil suit requesting 5,000 yuan, plus interest at a rate of 1.6% per month from October 16th of this year until the execution of the judgment. The court, based on the complaint, summoned both parties to the Criminal Division yesterday morning for questioning by Judge Qiu. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Jing Tiansheng, stated the intent of the lawsuit. When questioned, the defendant, Jin Youhai, admitted to borrowing the money and the second mortgage with China United Assurance Company, stating that it was due to the impact of poor market conditions, which resulted in the failure to rent out all of the completed houses. The rental income was not sufficient to cover the interest to China United Assurance Company, which led China United Assurance Company to withhold the monthly payment of 500 yuan. He claimed that it was all due to poor market conditions and that he would find a way to repay the plaintiff's loan. However, he argued that this was entirely a civil dispute, and the plaintiff should pursue civil litigation rather than criminal charges. After reviewing the statements and questioning the witness Zhang Zhiliang, the court deemed the facts clear and instructed the lawyers of both parties to argue their cases before declaring the hearing concluded and scheduling a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3>Seizure of Illegally Traded Firearms: Six Handguns Found in a White Canvas Bag; Suspect Arrested for Selling with Secret Signals</h3>
<p>Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Controller Wang Cheng, and Detective Zhou Honglin of the General Inspectorate received information that Shao Afang, a Ningbo native, was selling firearms in the灶披間 of No. 40, Lane 74, Beikai'er Road. They dispatched Detective Zhou, disguised as a customer, to negotiate with Shao. Shao claimed to have a total of ten handguns, with a minimum price of 35 yuan each, otherwise it would be difficult to make a deal. Detective Zhou said he would first buy six for trial use. As a result, around 1 to 3 PM the day before yesterday, they were to be delivered at the location. A pre-arranged signal of one silver yuan was given, and the remaining amount would be paid later. Shao agreed. At the appointed time, Inspector Wang and West Inspector Keming secretly went to the address and waited near the front and back doors, observing the situation. Detective Zhou entered and spoke with Shao, taking out 210 silver yuan from his pocket and asking him to hand over the firearms. Shao asked him to wait a moment and hurriedly went out. After a while, he returned with a white canvas bag containing six handguns and six hundred bullets. Following behind him was a local woman, Qiu Fangshi. Detective Zhou opened the bag, inspected it, and then grabbed both of Shao's hands. Upon hearing the signal, the Chinese and Western inspectors, along with Detective Zhang Yunhong and others, rushed in and arrested Shao. They learned that he lived upstairs at No. 18 Jinyang Lane on the same road. They went to the location to search and only found a bamboo basket. Shao claimed that the firearms belonged to Qiu Amao, her husband, who asked him to sell them on his behalf, with a commission of two silver yuan per gun. Three portraits were seen hanging on the wall, and Shao identified Qiu Amao's face. Shortly after, Qiu Amao entered from outside and was immediately apprehended. Upon questioning, they learned that three more handguns and four hundred bullets were hidden at No. 163, Lane 73, Beikai'er Road, at his mother-in-law's house. They went to arrest him again, but he had already escaped. The guns and bullets were found in a small room upstairs and were all taken to the Huishan Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department detailed the events and requested an extension for further investigation. Subsequently, Inspector Wang and Detective Zhou reported the details of the case. The guns and bullets were presented for inspection. Shao Afang firmly stated that Qiu Amao had asked him to sell them on his behalf, with a commission of two silver yuan per gun. Qiu Fangshi claimed that her husband had asked her to hide the guns and bullets in the bamboo basket. Qiu Amao confessed that he had bought the guns and bullets from a Japanese person on a certain ship for 24 silver yuan each. He claimed that one gun had been stolen two months ago. Because he had no sales channel, he asked Shao Afang to sell them on his behalf, but only the first time, pleading for leniency. Judge Xiao Bianfen ordered that they be remanded in custody separately, pending further investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Yongyuan Head Office and Branches Close Down; Owner and Manager Jiang Tingfu Absconds</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Yongyuan Head Office at No. 7 Laoyong'an Street in the French Concession was established by businessman Jiang Tingfu, who also served as the general manager. It had been in operation for more than seven years, with a capital of 50,000 yuan, mainly engaged in the export of national products. Branches were established in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Guangxi, and other places. The business was relatively developed, and the credit was also relatively good. Therefore, many national product factories traded with it. However, the company's finances were solely controlled by Jiang Tingfu. Recently, the two branch employees called, saying that it had gone bankrupt. The Shanghai office was unable to maintain operations and also ceased business. It is estimated that the debts owed include goods from national product factories, overdrafts from silver houses, and deposits from employees and friends, totaling more than 200,000 yuan. It is reported that the creditors are now planning to form a creditors' group to find ways to recover the debts.

<h3>Cai Renchu Inheritance Dispute: Either Partition or Liquidation; Mediation Fails and Lawsuit to Be Filed</h3>
<p>Cai Renchu, a Ningbo native merchant who lived in Shanghai, engaged in many businesses during his lifetime and possessed a large amount of wealth. Therefore, all of his estate after his death was managed by his wife, Cai Shen. Cai had several children, some of whom were grown up and some who were still young, and they all continued to live off of Mrs. Shen. However, his daughter, Cai Cuiyu, who is in her thirties and already married, currently lives in Yong'an Lane, Baier Road, in the French Concession. Since her father's death, she has requested the partition of the inheritance, claiming that her father had more than one million in estate and requesting that it be divided among her siblings according to their shares. However, Mrs. Cai Shen and her children believe that the exact amount of the estate has not been determined. If they want to partition it, they should first liquidate the assets, otherwise it would be difficult to divide. Negotiations between the two parties have continued until now without resolution. Cai Cuiyu hired Lawyer Yu and submitted a petition to the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, requesting that Mrs. Cai Shen and her children be ordered to appear in court for mediation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Jiandang specially opened a mediation court to hear the two parties. Lawyers represented each party in court. One party advocated for the immediate partition of all assets in accordance with the law, while the other party requested a three-week extension to first liquidate the estate and determine the amount before distributing it. As a result, mediation failed. Judge Zhou ordered them to leave and prepare for a formal lawsuit and await trial.</p>

<p>Important Notes for Each Unit</p>
<p>(1) Each unit must prepare its own team flag for use during the opening ceremony. The color, size, and design should be determined by each unit.</p>
<p>(2) Those in charge of each unit should gather all athletes before departure to practice the Games anthem and must distribute the sheet music and lyrics (the same as the previous Games, published in the Organizing Committee's first notice) to the athletes for use during the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>(3) Athletes of each unit must strive for neat and uniform attire to create a grand spectacle and boost morale.</p>
<p>(4) The weightlifting and race walking events in the Games demonstration program are part of the World Games program. Although this committee has not listed them as official championships, they are intended to review strength and provide a reference for selecting athletes for the World Games next year. It is hoped that those who have practiced considerably and achieved results will register to participate and showcase their skills, thereby assessing the level of the Chinese people's competition in these two events.</p>
<p>(5) The Games will not provide number cloths for ball game players. Each unit should specify this requirement when making uniforms before registration. Detailed instructions have been clearly stated in Article 4, Section 5 of the Organizing Committee's second notice. However, the numbers on the uniforms of male and female basketball players must not be (1) or (2). This is stipulated in the basketball rules because referees often use finger signals to announce fouls during basketball games, raising one finger to indicate one foul and two fingers to indicate two fouls. This silent code is commonly used by basketball referees. If there are uniforms with numbers (1) and (2), it is easy for recorders to misunderstand the referee's "one finger and two fingers" as "player number one" and "player number two." To avoid negligence when units make uniforms, this is specifically brought to your attention.</p>
<p>(6) The Games venue is in the city center, a wilderness area with many mosquitoes. Athletes from each unit must bring their own mosquito nets to ensure a peaceful night's sleep and prevent malaria. Those in charge of each unit must also urge athletes to bring face towels and basins to prevent trachoma transmission and emphasize hygiene.</p>
<p>Distribution of Sports Venues</p>
<p>The Games venue (Shanghai Sports Field) has been under construction for over a year. The Shanghai Sports Field (i.e., Track and Field Field), the Municipal Gymnasium, and the Municipal Swimming Pool, three major buildings, have been completed one after another. The paving of the track and field grass project was also recently completed. Volleyball and tennis courts are being rushed to completion, and the baseball field is just beginning to break ground, but it is expected to be completed in time for use. As of now, the construction is nearing completion, and the focus is on how to arrange it. The distribution of the venues and the subsequent progress are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(Track and Field Field) The Track and Field Field, also known as the Municipal Sports Field, is the main building of the entire venue, and the cost is also very high. Its greatness can be called unprecedented, but the internal layout of the building is slightly simplified due to insufficient funding at the end, which is somewhat unsatisfactory. Below the grandstand, there are two floors, the upper layer of which is set up as an athlete dormitory, which can accommodate 2,000 people. There are also sanitary facilities such as bathrooms and toilets. The lower layer, in addition to a part of it being used as offices and athlete canteens, etc., is used for opening temporary shops during the Games. It has now been rented out. The runway is 500 meters, with drainage pipes installed around it. The east and west sides are 200 meters of straight track. The track is 13 meters wide, which can provide 10 people for lane competition. The finish line for all distance track races is set on the west side of the straight track.</p>
<p>The layout of each field event venue has two locations, so that men and women or similar sports can be held at the same time, so that when the time is short and the scheduled items must be completed as quickly as possible, it can proceed smoothly without being restricted by the venue.</p>
<p>There are also vast open spaces at the north and south ends of the runway. The south end is designated as a tennis court. If necessary, the tennis finals will be held here. The north end is designated as a martial arts court. In the future, martial arts competitions will be held here, except for shuttlecock kicking in the gymnasium and long-distance shooting in another location.</p>
<p>(2) Gymnasium: The architecture of the gymnasium is very magnificent. The roof is covered with lead wire glass, with ample light and a comfortable height. The grandstand can accommodate three to four thousand people. Various facilities, such as bathrooms, gyms, dressing rooms, toilets, etc., are all available. The floor is also extremely solid and exquisite. The basketball hoop is made of steel and can be moved at any time. The grandstand is isolated from the court, so there is no confusion during the game.</p>
<p>(3) Swimming Pool: The swimming pool was opened first on September 8th. The pool is open-air, 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, and can accommodate ten people to compete at the same time. The grandstand is made of steel-concrete and can accommodate five to six thousand people. The pool is very large in capacity and has a circulating water filter to keep the pool water clean. Electric lights are installed at the bottom of the pool, illuminating the entire pool clearly. The lights and water color create a single entity. Watching it at night is even more enchanting and pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>(4) Soccer Field: The soccer field was originally planned to be opened outside the east rostrum of the track and field field, but it could not be realized due to time and economic reasons. In the future, all preliminary and secondary soccer games of the Games will be held at the Shen Garden soccer field under the jurisdiction of the National Sports Association on Yanping Road. The ground of the field is flat and the turf is dense. All international soccer and other important games in Shanghai have been held at the field. The four grandstands can accommodate more than 10,000 people, but the semi-finals and finals will be held on the soccer field temporarily arranged in the Games track and field field.</p>
<p>(5) Netball and Volleyball Fields: The tennis and volleyball fields are in front of the gymnasium according to the original plan. Now, because the soccer field is not opened separately, the area of ​​the original soccer field outside the east rostrum of the track and field field has been rebuilt into tennis and volleyball fields, with a total of eight tennis fields and four volleyball fields, which are connected to each other. Wooden grandstands are installed at both ends to accommodate two to three thousand people. The field is currently being rushed to completion and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>(6) Baseball and Softball Fields: The baseball field is at the west end of the track and field field. The ground is extremely open. Construction has now started, but due to limited economics, the ground will no longer be covered with grass. The four sides of the field are surrounded by wire mesh, and the grandstands are also made of wood. All baseball and women's softball games will be held here during the Games.</p>
<p>(7) Martial Arts Field: The martial arts field is opened at one end of the track and field field. The four sides are surrounded by wire mesh. The entrances and exits for athletes and staff are also different from those of the track and field field. Therefore, although the competition is held at the same time as the track and field competition, there is absolutely no disadvantage of hindering and disturbing the order. A platform is built inside the field for competition.</p>
<p>Summary of Venue Equipment</p>
<p>(1) Telephone: In order to facilitate the service of the referees and the speed of the transfer of results, telephone sets are installed in the offices of each sports field and in the track and field field. Important places in the track and field field, such as the starting and ending points of the runway, the general record office, the east and west rostrums, and the management office of the report board, can all communicate directly. Not only can staff and referees discuss problems with each other at any time, but the results of the competition can also be quickly transmitted to the scene, which is especially important to the interest of the audience. The project is currently being planned and installed by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. During the conference period, telephone calls can be made to facilitate the progress of the competition.</p>
<p>(2) Final Result Report Board: In addition to reporting the results of the track and field and swimming finals to the audience through the sound system, for fear that there may be errors when using ears instead of eyes, a separate result report board will be built. The names of the winners of each event, the affiliated units, time or distance, and the names of the six places are hung high on the board in two-foot square large characters to provide the audience with accurate reports. The board in the track and field field is installed on the top of the east rostrum, 23 feet high, and the board in the swimming pool is installed on the item of the grandstand, 10 feet high. The audience can see it at a glance even at the farthest point around the grandstand.</p>
<p>(3) Automatic Basketball Scoreboard: The scoreboard is made of wood, with four wheel axles on the back, and the wheels are painted with red bottoms and white numbers. The axles are tied with ropes, and weights of considerable weight are hung below, so that the wheel axles always have a tendency to turn down. Each wheel is put together in a rectangular hole on the record board that is eight inches high and six inches wide. In this way, as long as you lightly turn the button on the board, the wheel will turn down, and the numbers will change accordingly, just as you wish. The management is extremely simple and the use is also convenient.</p>
<p>(4) Basketball Game Roster: In a fiercely competitive basketball game, the audience is sad that they cannot recognize the names or faces of the players on the court. Although each player has numbers on the front and back of their chest to distinguish them, this mark can only be used for checking by game officials. For distant audiences, it is really of no help. In order to remedy this shortcoming in this Games, the names and numbers of the players on the court in each team are clearly marked in the lower part of the scoreboard for the audience to identify and remember. This equipment is not only beneficial to the audience, but also helpful to journalists.</p>
<p>Hygiene Equipment and Work</p>
<p>Now that the autumn climate is cool, thousands of athletes from different water and soil conditions at home and abroad are gathered in one place for this long-term competition. It is impossible in fact to ask for no problems in terms of health. In addition, during the conference period, the audience is crowded, and the occurrence of unexpected illnesses is also unavoidable. Therefore, the Games Hygiene Group has made in-depth considerations for all hygiene equipment and work, and has made precise plans for all aspects of medical treatment, prevention, health care, and environmental hygiene. The following points are of utmost importance. I hope you will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>(1 Regarding Medical Affairs)</p>
<p>(A) Clinic: A clinic is set up next to the office of the Hygiene Group in the general office building of the sports field to diagnose and treat diseases for the staff, athletes, and audiences of the Games. The clinic is equipped with two full-time doctors and nurses. During the Games, famous doctors and nurses from this city are also hired to take turns on duty to carry out the diagnosis and treatment work.</p>
<p>(B) Convalescent Room: A convalescent room with 20 beds is set up near the southeast entrance of the sports field. All equipment must be clean, perfect, and practical. It is specially used for people with minor illnesses and injuries to stay in the hospital. There are three nurses who are responsible for nursing.</p>
<p>(C) Specially Contracted Hospital: The Hygiene Group has a special contract with the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital and the Shanghai Municipal Hospital. Any infectious diseases and seriously injured patients will be transferred to these hospitals for diagnosis and treatment by the medical staff of the group. The hospitalization costs are negotiated for a half-price discount.</p>
<p>(D) First Aid Team: The Hygiene Group has organized four first aid teams and hired medical school students and nursing school students to take turns to volunteer. One team is stationed in the basketball court, martial arts hall, or swimming pool, two teams are stationed in the track and field field, and one team is stationed near the office of the Hygiene Group to wait for emergency treatment.</p>
<p>(E) Medical and First Aid Equipment: Although the Hygiene Group has little expense, it should still strive for perfection in medical and first aid equipment. In addition to borrowing part of the Shanghai Military Training Medical Equipment from the municipal government, it will borrow as much as possible from the Municipal Health Bureau if the number is insufficient. Other special equipment, such as oxygen supply devices, will be purchased as much as possible within the scope of the economy.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Prevention</p>
<p>(A) Preventing Gastrointestinal Diseases: Gastrointestinal diseases are caused by unclean food and drink. Therefore, managing small food stores inside and outside the sports field and the Association's kitchen and water supplies is of utmost importance. In addition to sending drinking water to the Municipal Health Testing Institute for testing every day, all food stores must be deemed satisfactory by the inspectors of the Hygiene Group before they can sell food and beverages. The water used in the swimming pool is also subject to bacterial examination every day to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>(B) Preventing Tuberculosis: In addition to posting signs that say "No Spitting," spittoons are set up in appropriate places to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(C) Preventing Malaria: There are many mosquitoes in the city center. In addition to asking the Health Bureau to intensify the mosquito extermination work in the area, athletes from all over the world are notified in advance to bring a mosquito net to prevent malaria.</p>
<p>(D) Preventing Sand Sleep: Strictly urge all athletes to bring their own face towels and basins to avoid the spread of sand eyes.</p>
<p>(E) Preventing Athlete's Foot: Anyone who has athlete's foot after a physical examination must immediately receive hygiene treatment. The group has specially prepared a large amount of athlete's foot medicine for athletes with athlete's foot to use. At the same time, a medicine trough is set up at the entrance of the swimming pool. Anyone who enters the pool to swim must first walk through this medicine trough to prevent the spread of athlete's foot.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Health Care</p>
<p>(A) Physical Examination: In order to avoid temporary crowding, the Games will notify each unit in advance to conduct its own inspection first, and submit the inspection certificate when registering. All those who participate in strenuous exercise and swimming will be subject to a re-examination by the hygiene team to show solemnity.</p>
<p>(B) Health Inspection: The Hygiene Group has requested medical schools to send a number of students to take turns to conduct health inspections of athletes during the Games. If any abnormal situations are found, they will report to the group at any time, and doctors and nurses will be sent to treat them immediately or the inspectors will find a way to send them to the convalescent room for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>(C) Health Guidance: In addition to printing and distributing health guidance texts and charts to athletes, health living slogans and charts will be posted in the athletes' dormitories to instill health knowledge in athletes.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding Environmental Sanitation</p>
<p>(A) Garbage Disposal: Garbage cans (a total of 100) will be set up in appropriate places in the dormitory for athletes, canteen, rest room, and various parts of the sports field to facilitate the collection of cleaners. The cleaners hired are all under the management and supervision of the inspectors of the Hygiene Group.</p>
<p>(B) Toilet Cleaning: In addition to the existing fixed toilets in the venue, it is planned to add several toilets that can accommodate 25 people at the same time, and they will be set up in the four directions of the venue. Male and female cleaners will be responsible for the cleaning and management, and will be supervised by the inspectors of the Hygiene Group.</p>
<p>(C) Fly Extermination Work: All items that are sufficient to breed or attract flies will be strictly prohibited by the inspectors of the Hygiene Group. Sodium cyanide will be used to kill maggots in the toilets, and lime will be used to kill pupae outside the toilets. The inspectors of the Hygiene Group will be responsible for supervising the cleaners to spread it.</p>
<p>(D) Hygiene Inspection: Inspectors of the Hygiene Group will be distributed in the venue and athlete dormitories, and are responsible for checking and prohibiting the cleanliness of the temporary market for selling food and beverages, as well as the environmental hygiene of the venue and dormitories. Their work is assigned according to the sections of the venue.</p>

<p>Soliciting Prizes, Please Donate Cash</p>
<p>Prizes are set up to encourage the interest of athletes and for commemorative purposes. They emphasize meaning rather than price. As the saying goes, "A small gift means a great deal." However, in the past, due to the improper award of prizes at some sports meets, the current trend of general athletes is to aim at obtaining a large amount of material. The growth of this kind of "prize desire" is enough to cultivate the youth's vanity and arrogance, and forget the purpose of their education. Abundant prizes are similar to the giving and receiving of money, which loses the spirit of amateur sports. In order to correct the abuses of the past, the Games prizes are based on frugality, and every effort is made to ensure that the total value of what each person receives does not exceed the provisions of the Association's amateur rules. In addition, social customs often use copper-plated silver for prizes. Once exposed to sunlight or after a long period of time, the color changes. This kind of prize is close to hypocrisy and deception, and it also loses the true meaning of the award and fails the efforts of the athletes. Therefore, the prizes for this Games will strive for less quantity and higher quality, so that the athletes will feel that they are valuable and can be permanently commemorated. In order to realize the tenth narration plan, the Standing Committee of the Organizing Committee has decided to follow the example of the previous session, and the Association will send letters to the central agencies and provincial and municipal governments. When giving prizes, they will donate cash to be made on behalf of the Association in order to be uniform and easy to distribute. Starting from today, collection will begin. For all prizes made on behalf of the Association, the names of the institutions or individuals will still be engraved on the prizes to promote the enthusiasm for supporting sports. If you are willing to assist, please send the money to the Prize Shares of the Organizing Committee of the Sixth National Games in the central district of Shanghai for safekeeping and production.</p>

<p>Measures for Reduction of Ship Fares by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Reply from the Ministry of Communications, "Approved letter, regarding the reduction and exemption of round-trip train fares for judges and athletes during the congress. Please follow the established case and reply, etc., after ordering the State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to report back, it should be handled in accordance with the company's rules for free and reduced ship fares, etc., reply for verification.

It has been reported back by the State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that the company had no fixed free and reduced fare method during the National Games in the 20th and 22nd years. At that time, it was in compliance with the order of your Ministry and the approved method of the National Government and the Ministry of Education. Therefore, the round-trip fares of the judges and athletes were either free or reduced by a quarter. Now that the rules for free and reduced ship fares have been announced and implemented, it seems that it should be handled in accordance with item B of Article 4 of the rules, etc. According to this, the old debts of the State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are heavy and the deficits are huge. If we do not strive to increase business income, it will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, the company formulated twelve rules for free and reduced ship fares last year and submitted them to the Ministry for approval and implementation. All requests for free or reduced ship fares from all walks of life over the years have been handled in accordance with these rules. The round-trip ship fares of all judges and athletes in this National Games should be handled in accordance with item B of Article 4 of the rules. In addition to instructions, I have attached a copy of the rules for free and reduced ship fares of the State-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and replied for verification.

Now, to meet the needs of all parties and to reward its loyal customers, the factory, taking advantage of the autumn season, when people are making new clothes, has launched an autumn sale for 30 days, starting on the 14th of this month. All goods will be drastically reduced in price, a truly shocking sacrifice. The factory also employs professional tailoring technicians to provide custom tailoring services, with timely and prompt delivery, and charges only at cost. Both branches, located at the Penglai Road Penglai Market and the Nanjing Road Continental Department Store, can take measurements.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Executive and Supervisory Meeting</h3>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Tu Kaizheng, Fan Heshi, Zhou Mengbai, and Zhu Chen. The results are as follows: (1) Sun Choucheng reported on the flood relief donations.

Zhou Bangjun, Yuan Hesong, and Zhu Yuquan were appointed as a committee of three to handle the matter in its entirety. (2) Members requested clarification on various points regarding the affixing of stamps.

The remaining questions will be answered in detail in accordance with the detailed rules for implementation. (3) The Chinese-Western, Sino-German, Yonghe, and Windsor Pharmacies requested amendments to the association's charter to reduce membership fees.

It was decided that the request would be granted, and Xu Naochu, Zhou Bangjun, and Hesong were appointed as a committee of three to arrange the premises. (5) Lianchangde Pharmacy and Weiling Medicine Company requested to join the association. It was decided that the requests would be approved.</p>
<h3>Lida Academy Farm Honey Sells Well</h3>
<p>The honey market in this city has long been dominated by American and Australian honey, resulting in a considerable outflow of national wealth each year. In the past four or five years, Chinese people have gradually adopted scientific methods to raise Italian bees, and the production of honey has increased daily. The general public has gradually come to recognize honey as a nutritious food, and the consumption of honey has become increasingly widespread. The purple clover honey produced in this city is of excellent quality, with a clear and bright color, and is highly praised by customers. In order to promote sales and popularize honey consumption, the original price of 6 jiao per bottle has been reduced to 5 jiao. Major companies such as China Goods, Wing On, Sincere, and other major department stores, as well as major pharmacies, candy companies, food companies, Nanjing Matekang, Yingfeng, and other well-known stores in this city, and China Goods companies throughout the country, all act as sales agents. The Sanyou Industrial Society considers the farm's honey to be a rare domestic product and has recently also begun distributing it. With the arrival of autumn, honey has become a seasonal food, so the farm's honey is selling particularly well.</p>

<h3>Little Men (49)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>First, Tommy uttered a roar of anger, followed by a general uproar in the hall, which continued until Donny felt that he was outnumbered, and proposed a knife game. Whoever won would take the treasure. Tommy agreed, and everyone stood around to watch, their faces tense. When Tommy won, their faces changed to expressions of relief. Tommy put the small knife in the deepest part of his safest pocket.</p>
<p>"You and I will go together, and I will show you around," Nat said to Donny, feeling that he had to have a serious conversation with his friend.</p>
<p>No one knew what the two of them talked about, but when they came back later, Donny's manners towards everyone were much better, although his speech and actions were still rough. What more could we expect from this poor child? Although he was young, he had already experienced much of the world, living a wandering life, and no one had ever taught him.</p>
<p>The boys had decided not to like him, and they only allowed Nat to accompany him. Nat soon felt that the responsibility was too heavy, but he couldn't bear to abandon him.</p>
<p>However, Tommy still felt that although the knife incident had happened, there was already a connection of sympathy between them, and he often wanted to talk to him about the interesting topic of somersaults. His opportunity soon arrived, because Donny saw how much he envied him, and gradually became friendly to him. Within a week, he was already very familiar with the lively Tommy.</p>

<h3>The Significance of Simplified Characters in the Literacy Movement (Part 2) - Lecture by Lei Zhen on the Central Broadcasting Station on September 14</h3>
<p>Since the government and experts have agreed on the principle of promoting simplified characters, the next issue is the selection of characters. Experts in the field believe that simplifying characters is not a fundamental reform of Chinese characters. The standard should be to search and collect existing styles from historical cursive, running script, variant forms, and reduced strokes, and to take those familiar and easy to promote. It is not necessary to create new forms, because characters without historical habit relationships are not only difficult to achieve their purpose but may also cause resistance. At present, the commonly used simplified characters are being compiled into a simplified spectrum, and the coordination of radicals will be selected later. This initial selection work was entrusted to the former National Language Unification Committee. After the initial draft was prepared, the text was reviewed word by word, and the selection and compilation were carried out in accordance with the principle of "transmitting but not creating." The entire list of more than 2,400 characters was sorted and deleted to 324 characters as the first batch of published simplified character lists. However, there are still many characters that should be published but have not been published, and people in the country inevitably complain that the number is too small to be used. This issue was also deliberated several times during the selection process. Because the goal is to make the written strokes simple and the structure easy, so that children and the public can easily recognize and write them, it was generally advocated that: 1. Characters within four or five strokes should not be simplified; 2. Characters that are only simplified into one or two strokes should not be adopted; 3. Characters that are only regional (occasionally used in one place) should not be used; 4. Only characters that have been used for a long time and are widely popular should be adopted. Although the number of characters in the first batch is small and the table is simple, because this is basic work, the selection should be stricter at the beginning of promotion. Once promotion has reached a considerable level and the society has a correct understanding, there is plenty of room for remedy when the second and third batches are published successively.</p>
<p>After the character selection was finalized, the Ministry of Education drafted and promulgated implementation measures, instructing the education departments and bureaus of each province to follow them. The promulgation measures are restated as follows: (1) Textbooks for primary schools, short-term primary schools, and public schools, as well as reading materials for children and the public, should all use the simplified characters promulgated by the Ministry of Education. (2) Textbooks using simplified characters should attach a new word list at the end of each volume, incorporating the simplified character list, and a comparison table should be established at the end or bottom of the first textbook using the character, or in other appropriate places, for comparison. (3) From July 1936, newly compiled primary school textbooks, short-term primary school textbooks, and public school textbooks that do not use the simplified characters promulgated by the Ministry of Education will not be approved. (4) From July 1936, all copies of the textbooks opened in the previous clause shall use the simplified characters promulgated by the Ministry of Education. (5) From July 1936, children's or public reading materials newly compiled or reprinted that do not use the simplified characters promulgated by the Ministry of Education shall not be adopted by schools. (6) From July 1936, all levels of normal schools should focus on the teaching of the simplified characters promulgated by the Ministry of Education. (7) From July 1936, the simplified characters promulgated by the Ministry of Education may be uniformly applied to all school examination papers. (8) Newspaper businesses in all provinces, cities, and counties should be advised by the local competent educational administrative organs to adopt the simplified characters promulgated by the Ministry of Education for typesetting to the extent possible.</p>
<p>The government is embracing the greatest determination to advocate from above. If the people of the whole country have this deep understanding and effort, and everyone starts to eliminate illiteracy, everyone extends to others what they know. Not only can they get the possibility of receiving education in short-term primary schools or adult remedial schools, but also in remote areas, in small groups, everyone can teach the unknown with what they know. People can get the opportunity to read and write at any time in the community. Using this simplified character tool, instill it into the minds of people in all different environments, so that they can receive it in their brains and use it in their hands. They can have the skills to live, and citizens of the country have the qualifications of modern citizens that they should have. Not only has the goal of the literacy movement been achieved, but also most of our compatriots, who can only consume, do not produce, and only have the shell of life without the spirit of life, can transform uselessness into usefulness, and can get the greatest efficiency from the most economical tools. The meaning of life is improved, and we can talk about the conditions of survival of the fittest, and we can talk about jointly shouldering the responsibility of construction and national salvation. The significance of the literacy movement that I am talking about today lies here. (End)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Municipal Government Compiling Elementary School Textbooks - Suitable for the Environment of Tianjin, North China</h3>
<p>(Tianjin, September 17th) The Tianjin Municipal Government has decided to revise the textbooks for elementary schools to suit the environment of elementary schools in North China and Tianjin. Mayor Cheng Keyan and expert Xie, along with the new Director of the Education Bureau, Li Jinzao, are responsible for carrying out the work.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Province Exempts Elementary School Tuition Fees - Highly in Line with the Ministry's Goal of Universalizing Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>The Guizhou Provincial Department of Education has drafted standards for the collection of tuition fees for schools at all levels in the province. Elementary schools are completely free of charge, and middle schools also charge very little tuition, which can greatly understand the economic burden of the people. The report to the provincial government of the province stated that the collection of tuition fees by schools should be determined within the standards issued by the Ministry, taking into account the economic capacity of the local people, so that ordinary students have the opportunity to go to school and will not be unable to afford the fees and lose their studies. Elementary schools should be exempted from tuition fees to make education more accessible. The collection of fees by public and private schools at all levels in the province has always been without a fixed standard. In order to unify the methods, in addition to ordering the county governments to investigate the number and purpose of the fees collected by private schools and report them to the department for verification, the provincial department of education specially follows the provisions of Chapter XI of the Ministry's Elementary School Regulations and Chapter XI of the Ministry's Middle School Regulations, and, taking into account the economic capacity of the people of the province, has drafted standards for the collection of tuition fees for provincial schools at all levels as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Provincial normal schools, girls' normal schools, simplified normal schools, rural education teacher training institutes, and vocational schools' vocational departments operated concurrently by middle schools shall not collect tuition fees. (2) Provincial middle schools: high school departments will charge 10 yuan per person per academic year, and junior high school departments will charge 6 yuan. (3) Provincial elementary schools (provincial normal school affiliated elementary schools and provincial girls' normal school affiliated elementary schools are included): the senior department will charge 1 yuan per person per academic year, and the junior department will be free of charge. (4) If students in provincial elementary and middle schools have excellent academic performance, pure conduct, and sound physique, they may be exempted from tuition fees at the discretion of the principal, who will submit a special report to the department for verification. It is also heard that the provincial government has recently approved the application.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province School Principals Request Payment of Arrears</h3>
<p>(Changsha, September 17th) The presidents and accountants of provincial schools are requesting the raising and payment of arrears again, otherwise they will resign. The Ministry of Education asked them to do their best to overcome the difficulties and to raise and pay the education fees as much as possible.</p>
<h3>City Education Bureau Promotes Phonetic Han Characters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to various social education organizations, cultural groups, and public and private elementary and secondary schools stating that the Ministry of Education's Order No. 11932 states that the phonetic symbols can assist in literacy and unify the national language. The Central Executive Committee decided to promote the phonetic symbols at the 88th meeting in 1930, and the Ministry of Education also detailed the promotion measures in 25 articles in the same year and ordered them to be followed. The promotion situation in various places in recent years, although the effectiveness is visible, most of the teaching textbooks used in elementary schools and public schools are still written and printed entirely in Han characters, and the phonetic symbols have not been adopted in tandem for annotation. The Ministry has carefully considered that the imperfection of printing tools is a major reason. Therefore, the Ministry raised funds and handed them over to merchants to cast Chinese phonetic bronze molds to facilitate needs. The bronze molds are fully equipped with various sizes, and they will be cast soon. They are extremely economical and beautiful. In accordance with the spirit of the Central Resolution of 1930, and in consideration of the opinions of experts, the Ministry has formulated measures to promote the phonetic Han characters to facilitate implementation. In addition to issuing a notice, the Ministry has also entrusted the Shanghai China Bookstore to rush to manufacture various sizes of phonetic Han bronze molds, with a time limit for completion, for various authors and printing shops to purchase at a price, or to follow the current fixed style and procedures to cast their own. All orders are to be followed.</p>

<h3>Fourth Anniversary of the September 18th Incident</h3>
<p>— (Huang Jiping)</p>
<p>Someone asked me: What are your thoughts on the fourth anniversary of the September 18th Incident?</p>
<p>I said: In this day and age, we must be cautious in our speech, and there is no point in talking about any feelings. However, there are a few irrelevant words that we can chat about: (1) People in general, seeing that Abyssinia is not afraid of powerful neighbors and has consistently resisted Italy, have been greatly stimulated. I think that the spirit of the Abyssinian King and tribal warriors to defend their country and land is worthy of respect, and it is also worthy of being our example. However, China's situation is different from Abyssinia's, and we must be clear about it ourselves. (2) The League of Nations is ultimately an organ for the division of spoils by the great powers. Those who trusted it before can now realize this! Since Germany and Japan withdrew from the League, Italy will also withdraw. In fact, China should also withdraw. Every year, we can save a large amount of membership fees and transfer it to proper uses. Anyway, we want to be independent and do not need the League of Nations as a guarantee. (3) The law of the jungle has become a common rule, and it will become more and more intense in the future. The people of the country should work hard to "save the country in their own position" and enrich the national strength. Why worry about foreign insults? (4) In today's world, a country with insufficient national defense is in danger of being slaughtered at any time. Therefore, we people must demand the construction of a scientific China. In addition, I dare not talk more about my thoughts on the September 18th Incident.</p>
<h3>Clipping from the Mountains</h3>
<p>— Yan Boguang</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled to Hangzhou knows that Zhang Xiaoquan's scissors are very famous. Especially female tourists, when they come to Hangzhou, may buy dozens of pairs to take back home and give to relatives and friends. However, there are too many Zhang Xiaoquan scissor shops in Hangzhou, which makes tourists dizzy, and they don’t know which one is the real Zhang Xiaoquan old shop. This phenomenon is just like Lu Gaojian in Suzhou. Even the locals living in Suzhou cannot tell which one is the real Lu Gaojian.</p>
<p>As long as the goods are good, there is no need for an old brand. Like the trend of the modern era, the progress of science is rapid. Newly invented items often appear in society, and many are very exquisite.</p>
<p>Mountain scissors have recently been welcomed by women because of their low price and good quality. Speaking of the word "mountain," it is an abbreviation for Dongting Mountain. Everyone knows that Dongting Mountain is located in the center of Taihu Lake. Mountain scissors are sold by women from the mountain. Their clear and crisp calls are drawn out. Although they only sell along the streets, because the sound is so loud, it is transmitted into the houses and may be called in by young mistresses or concubines. However, they are very skilled in business. Nine out of ten deals are successful. We have heard since we were young that the people who occupy the most common business in the business world are from Dongting Mountain and Huizhou. There is a saying, "People from Dongting Mountain are everywhere, and people from Huizhou are all over the place." Today, we see women from the mountains selling scissors, and they have such good business acumen. How can people not admire them?</p>
<h3>Hired Mourners</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>In Shanghai, among the many "businesses without capital," "hired mourning" is also a kind of occupation.</p>
<p>Whenever a family has a funeral, and the deceased is a young person who has not yet married, the parents are inconvenient to follow the coffin all the way to the cemetery to cry. Then, at this time, they need to hire "hired mourning" women.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is where these women get their tears from. As soon as they enter the mourning gate and see the unfamiliar corpse placed in the hall, they cover their faces with handkerchiefs and wail loudly. They cry so sadly that even passers-by are moved to tears. Their whole bodies are sobbing, uttering the most mournful tunes word by word, making people mistakenly believe that they are the closest relatives of the bereaved family, never thinking that they are there to sell tears. They understand the highest efficiency of service.</p>
<p>The most poignant and tragic moment is at the cemetery, wailing wildly at the tomb, as if the ruthless yellow earth is about to swallow their own people. They cry so hard that the accompanying people cannot help but feel a mixture of emotions, their eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that women who engage in this kind of business must first have an extremely painful living environment, and they themselves must have the most unfortunate fate. Otherwise, they would never be able to cry so "realistically." Some people say that when they start crying, it is fake, but when the tears come out, they remember their own deceased husbands and their own suffering, and then they become truly sad. This is called "borrowing someone else's corpse to cry about one's own misery." I think this view is the most similar.</p>
<h3>Little Pigeons Under Coercion</h3>

<h3>Continued Inheritance of Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>On August 14, this publication published an article by Mr. Bin Xi, "The Inheritance of Intelligence," citing the results of the psychologist Goddard's research on the Kallikak family pedigree: It is said that Martin Kallikak, a son of a good family, had an affair with a mentally handicapped woman, resulting in none of his 480 descendants being anything but mentally handicapped. Reading this makes people know that choosing a spouse is a major event and should not be taken lightly. Here is another example.</p>
<p>Jonathan Edwards, the most famous preacher and thinker in the United States, and his wife were both from famous families. According to Dr. Winship's investigation of his family tree, the results are as follows:</p>
<p>Of the 1,900 descendants, 1,394 have been identified, including: 295 university graduates; 13 university presidents; 60 doctors; 100 pastors, missionaries, or theology professors; 75 army and navy officers; 60 famous writers, who have edited 135 kinds of famous works and 18 kinds of periodicals; 33 philanthropists, whose benevolence has spread both at home and abroad; more than 100 lawyers, the most famous of whom is Professor Wooley of Yalet; 80 judges; 80 people who have held important national positions, including Vice President Aaron Burr; 3 senators; governors, congressmen, state administrative officials, mayors, and foreign envoys; 1 president of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company; 1 director of the Railway Bureau, bank presidents, insurance company managers, and 15 people who have managed other industrial enterprises. Based on this, it can be proved that the progress of all aspects of society and public happiness are closely related to this healthy nation. Also, none of their descendants have committed crimes.</p>
<p>Comparing the pedigrees of the two families, we can see how important it is to value the union of husband and wife! According to Western sayings, "Like Produces Like"; there are also Chinese folk sayings such as "Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, thieves raise sons to dig through walls": this is further confirmed by the theory of heredity and eugenics.</p>

<p>Chapter 19: High Officials Cherish Their Reputation, Skillful in Exploitation; New Love Separated from Flesh and Blood, No Way to Visit the Sick</p>
<p>Ze Cheng said: "How did you negotiate with them?" Jie Fu said: "Go and inquire. The first person who spoke to me was the Northwest Investigation Commissioner of the China Bank, the future manager of the Xi'an branch, named Jia Duocai. The second person is Zhou Yourong, a famous and unyielding official in Shaanxi. They both said that they would publish this matter in the newspaper and seek public judgment from society. I repeatedly said that the matter is over, let it be. Anyway, whether the hotel comes forward or not, why should the two of you disagree with Commissioner Lan? You saw that I made them laugh with a few words... If I can comfort them a few more words, maybe nothing will happen. If you are not at ease, I can run a few more times with you. Although you don't admit that I am a relative, we are still from the same hometown. I am willing to do my best for you with the friendship of a fellow villager." Qiu Ze Cheng was a little embarrassed, so he smiled and cupped his hands and said: "I used to be quite inadequate... Don't take it to heart, please sit in my house for a while." Jie Fu said: "If the commissioner has something to say to me directly, I won't care about the past." Ze Cheng said! "Good, good, please come to my house and sit down for a while." He led Zhang Jie Fu to his own house. Then he went to see Commissioner Lan. At this time, Commissioner Lan was not the same as before. He was sitting at the table with a cigar in his mouth and his head propped up with one hand. His face kept sinking, and seemed a little pale. As for Madam Lan, she originally had another room, but she was not in her usual room, but lying on the master's bed with her clothes on. Ze Cheng came in, but before he could open his mouth, Commissioner Gai asked. "What's wrong? What's wrong?" Ze Cheng said: "It's nothing." (318)</p>
<h3>The Fragrant Drifting Record of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 33: Rare Flowers in the Imperial Garden</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the concept of beauty is indeed thicker and more common for women, so women are particularly fond of flowers and are particularly good at appreciating them; especially our Empress Dowager, in addition to power and wealth, flowers may be her most precious hobby. Although she is not yet qualified as a "flower idiot," she is already deeply obsessed! In our imperial garden, there are really countless kinds of strange flowers and exotic plants collected. All the flower species that can be found or bought must be found by some means before stopping: fortunately, there is another part of the eunuchs in the palace who are specially performing the duties of gardeners. They also have a wide range of horticultural knowledge, and can take good care of all kinds of flowers and trees for the Empress Dowager, and they can all develop very appropriately. What's more, the Empress Dowager herself has to go to various places to inspect every two or three days, and there is no room for them to be lazy or negligent! (418)</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3>Time of Playfulness</h3>
<p>— Pian Yue</p>
<p>As usual, "life in the world" goes on day after day, growing up day after day. No one can stop it or keep it, nor can anyone escape it and be unrelated to the years, unless they destroy their lives. Everyone is very obviously making time a savings jar and a record book!</p>
<p>In the whole of life, from childhood to adulthood to old age, progressing in order is also an unchangeable discipline. So, if we have to think about the next best thing, which is more appropriate for us to spend more or less time in the course of life? Is there an accurate evaluation of this?</p>
<p>If we say it well from an optimistic point of view, spending less time is "young and handsome," and it is also said that "heroes come from youth." Spending more time is also "mature and experienced," and it is also said that "reading belongs to the old." It seems that they are all satisfactory.</p>
<p>If we say it badly, if we spend too few years, it is either "youthful vigor" or "inexperience"; if we spend too many years, it is either "old and cunning" or "old and mediocre," and it seems that they are not worth mentioning!</p>
<p>"Jiangnan sees Jiangbei as good," human nature is quite dissatisfied with real life. Young people always envy the experience of the elderly and yearn for the future, while the elderly always miss the innocence of youth and are attached to the past; therefore, many young people try their best to imitate what the elderly do, striving to achieve the qualification of "young and mature," while the elderly mostly try to preserve their youthful behavior, seeking the reputation of "retaining a childlike heart."</p>
<p>"Having a mouth to talk about others, but no mouth to talk about oneself," human nature is also mostly ignorant of contributing to oneself and clear about blaming others. Those who think that they are "young and mature" do not know that there are many people who disagree with them and are criticizing them for being "too old"; those who think that they are "retaining a childlike heart" also do not know that there are also people who are not satisfied with them and are despising them for being "too childish"!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people with fewer years always feel superficial and inadequate, and can feel novelty and interest in all things and states. The more years pass, the deeper they enter the world, and the more they experience everything, the more they understand, and the more their talents increase and become more prepared; when they reach a sufficient age, they will naturally feel and reach a state like "knowing before falling" everywhere, which is almost beyond their own expectations in the past. The common name for those who plan far ahead is "old fox," which is really not wrong! The qualifications accumulated over the years will naturally be cunning and unpredictable, like the characteristics of a fox! However, when people become familiar with everything in the world, the past years must have been many, and the remaining years of the future are really limited. Decay and decrepitude will gradually make your abundant talents useless. Living to a hundred years is the end of life, making you only enough to be a slave to time in this life, unable to exert yourself there. Otherwise, if life could usually live to two hundred years, wouldn't there be more living immortals in the world, and the mystery of the universe would not be difficult to break?</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, time is really a great deception, spreading out like a great net, waiting for anyone who enters the world to drill into it, let him get old, until death, such a silent, odorless, and intangible thing, who can avenge him? Life, this useless thing, can only lower its head silently, be docile and submissive, and suffer his jokes and trampling!</p>
<p>So, is time to be cursed? No, no! I only feel that time is the most humorous thing—how funny he is!</p>

<h3>Financial Giants Compete to Purchase, Tender Price Falls Sharply and Rises Sharply, Italian-Abyssinian War Unable to Stop, Once Reached 60 Yuan Mark, Foreign Exchange Loose and Then Suddenly Firm, Closing Back at 11 Yuan 3</h3>
<p>The gold market has been extremely fatigued since the sudden and tragic fall in the previous dynasty. Yesterday, there was still a downward trend, but because the Central Bank opened a lot of preparations, it suddenly became stagnant. There was too much floating short, and people started to buy, and the buying trend rebounded sharply, resulting in a rebound. In the early morning, the overseas silver market, both the UK and the US were flat, and the forward silver price in Montedori rose by 1/100 to 2.5/100. The exchange rate continued to fall, and London raw gold fell by 2.5 pence, but people were not satisfied. The off-site pre-market trading opened and turned into 66 yuan, which was bought by Fuxingshui. However, because the sellers were eager, Huixiang was also injured and once fell to 3 yuan. Fuxing, Yonghua, and Feng entered again to 5.5 yuan, Huifu Yu sold, and the price dropped to 4 yuan. Fuxing, Yongyong, and Lilai entered, and the price rose to over 7 yuan. In the morning, Gaoxiu opened, and after the opening, the Central Bank's brand was announced, and both the UK and the US rose. The customs gold unit fell by points, and the standard tender price was listed and retreated to 912.5 yuan, which was slightly lower. However, because the giants competed to purchase and the banks scraped together, the exchange market tightened. The buying sentiment was quite strong at the time, and it broke through the 70 yuan mark. It was learned that HSBC Bank lost its temper, the British rose by 1.25, and the US rose by 1.875. The banks took advantage of the opportunity to plug in and then fell together. However, because the mainland Shanghai and other places were still scraping, and the Central Bank also had open positions, people's hearts were calmed down. At this time, there were many rebounds. After entering, the exchange market suddenly became loose, and Foreign Lei also intended to show each other. The news that the war against Abyssinia could not be stopped was transmitted, and people's hearts had already turned tired. At this point, the downward trend was launched, but the giants took the opportunity to buy at low prices again, and there were many struggles in the middle. The Hong Kong market was hard, and the banks' selling was even stronger. The 60 yuan mark was also broken, and the exchange market became loose again and again, and the situation in the market was oversupplied, and it fell step by step. The silver forecast in India also rose to Anna, and the situation was very tired. However, the giants still bought at low prices, and the noon closing turned slightly flat. The off-market market then broke through the 60 yuan mark, and people's hearts turned firm. After the opening, the giants continued to buy fiercely, and the banks also came to scrape together. The exchange market tightened, stimulating the buying sentiment, and the rise was very rapid. However, because the banks took the opportunity to plug in at high prices, the market rebounded after the high. Guangdong and other gangs desperately scraped foreign exchange, causing the domestic market to tighten even more. The buying sentiment in the market was even hotter, and it broke through the 70 yuan mark. The banks took the opportunity to plug in five times at high prices, and Hong Kong also came to sell by telegram. The silver in India reported a rise of 4 Anna, and the degree returned to fall. However, because Guangdong continued to make up for it, and scraped US dollars, the table turned tight, and the shorts competed to purchase. Finally, it broke through 70 yuan again, and the rising trend was quite strong. Today, the market situation will be recorded later.</p>

<h3>Wild Speculation by the Cantonese: The Exchange Rate, From Relaxed to Tight</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's long and short-term rates were flat, and New York's silver market remained unchanged. Montreal's forward silver prices rose by varying amounts, up to 2.5%. London's spot gold fell by 2.5 pence. The British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar to 9375, and against the French franc by 10 points. The U.S. dollar strengthened against the British pound by a fraction, and against the French franc by 25. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for the British pound at one shilling and seven pence, and the U.S. dollar at 39.0625 yuan. However, due to optimistic sentiment, the rates soon changed to one shilling, six pence, and 9375 for the British pound, and 38.89375 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared to the previous closing rates, the British pound was flat and the U.S. dollar was tight by 1875. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with the British pound rising by 125 and the U.S. dollar by 1875. The customs gold unit fell by one cent, slightly calming sentiment. However, as banks engaged in heavy speculation, the market tightened again after the opening. It was anticipated that the HSBC's official rates would be announced, with the British pound rising by 125 and the U.S. dollar by 1875. Banks took advantage of the high rates to sell, gradually bringing the market back to a flat position. However, the mainland, Shanghai, and other areas continued to speculate, causing the market to fluctuate. Hong Kong continued to ease, and banks suddenly sold heavily. Continental banks also released their holdings, and advantageous entities engaged in aggressive selling. Pessimistic news, such as reports from foreign dispatches that both sides in the Italy-Abyssinia conflict had taken a firm stance, made it difficult for the market to rally and maintain stability, leading to repeated easing. It was predicted that the Indian silver would rise by two annas, and would become even tighter thereafter. However, some engaged in speculation while prices were low, causing a slight improvement at noon. In the afternoon, the market gradually tightened, and banks also engaged in speculation. However, HSBC continued to sell, causing the market to fluctuate. Subsequently, Cantonese speculators aggressively bought U.S. dollars, causing a continuous tightening process. However, banks took advantage of the high rates to sell from time to time. Later, as Indian silver rose by four annas and the Hong Kong market eased, there was a temporary easing. Banks sold aggressively, and Hong Kong entities also sold by telegraph. However, sentiment had improved, and Cantonese speculators continued to buy, ultimately tightening the market again. The closing near-term selling price was one shilling, six pence, and 8125 for the British pound, and 28.6875 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared to the previous closing prices, the British pound was tighter by 125, and the U.S. dollar by 4375. Chinese merchants and intermediaries engaged in speculation, with an estimated speculation volume of 50,000 pounds for the British pound and over 500,000 yuan for the U.S. dollar. A record of today's transactions will be provided later.</p>
<p>The British pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of one shilling, six pence, and 9375. Citibank took November at 4375 and 375.

<h3>Autumn Goods Sales Brisk, Bank Remittances Increase</h3>
<p>Since the Mid-Autumn Festival, various business operations have been hampered by tight financial conditions, making it difficult to operate as desired. The situation has been sluggish and lacking in vigor. However, bank remittances have been brisk due to the seasonal availability of autumn goods, both imported and domestic, especially silk and cloth, which are in high demand. The volume of remittances for these goods often reaches millions, and the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic. However, the interbank lending rate remains unchanged, opening at 10.3 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions. There is no added interest on clean bills, but the Small Clearing House rate is slightly higher at 1.3 cents. Interbank lending transactions totaled over 3.9 million in the morning session, with new transactions of over 400,000. Afternoon transactions totaled over 600,000, and Small Clearing House transactions totaled over 400,000. It appears that there are no issues with interbank lending among affiliated institutions, but non-affiliated institutions require careful consideration before lending. Therefore, interbank lending transactions are unlikely to boom. Collateralized lending transactions amounted to over 400,000 in redemptions and over 300,000 in new loans. Banknote transactions involved the recall of over 1.3 million, with the issuance of over 600,000 in circulating notes and over 700,000 in marked notes. Customer sources amounted to 400,000, with 150,000 in withdrawals and over 400,000 in banknotes. Remittances from native banks totaled over 4.3 million, and remittances for foreign goods totaled over 3.3 million. Remittances from various sources amounted to over 900,000, with 7-800,000 in cash withdrawals. Regarding bank remittance news, foreign banks' remittance totaled 1.7-800,000, various remittances and collateral totaled 3.0 million, goods remittances totaled 1.3 million, telegraphic transfers totaled 500,000, foreign exchange settlements totaled 800,000, special remittances totaled 900,000, and warehouse entries totaled 900,000. Chinese banks' remittances totaled 3.1 million, various remittances, collateral, and tax payments totaled 3.4 million, goods remittances totaled 1.4 million, special remittances totaled 600,000, foreign exchange settlements totaled 900,000, telegraphic transfers totaled 600,000, and warehouse exits totaled 400,000. Japanese banks' remittance totaled 1.5-600,000, various goods and remittances totaled 3.7-800,000, foreign exchange settlements totaled 800,000, special remittances totaled 700,000, telegraphic transfers totaled 800,000, and warehouse entries totaled 500,000. Overall, the market situation yesterday was sluggish, but remittance activity was brisk. As for Jiangnan silver, the morning price rose by one yuan to 835 yuan, but the afternoon price fell back to the previous afternoon's price of 833 yuan. The transaction volume was 4,000 taels in the morning and 3,000 taels in the afternoon, similar to the previous afternoon. Guangdong silver was 752 yuan in the morning and rose by 5 jiao to 756.5 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 2.5 yuan from the previous day's morning price. The transaction volume was 130,000 jiao in the morning and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins fell by 2,000 wen to 344,000 wen, with a transaction volume of 37,840 strings of cash, equivalent to 11,000 yuan in silver. The total number of bills exchanged in the city was 11,196,606.07 silver dollars, including 4,821,197.21 silver dollars in general exchange, 4,414,835.66 silver dollars in remittances, 1,833,393.83 silver dollars in collections by money shops, and 1,169,579.37 silver dollars from other sources.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds: Both Bulls and Bears Engage in Swaps - This Month's Deposit Balance Still Lags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the market situation was relatively stable. Futures trading was quite lively, with both bulls and bears participating, but the market was dominated by bear swaps. The market had an unstable appearance, and market sentiment remained weak. The Italy-Abyssinia dispute has reached its final stage, but it has no temporary impact on China's public bond market. However, people are uneasy due to the Italy-Abyssinia situation. Before the situation is clarified, the market will be difficult to improve. Moreover, existing arbitrage cannot be swapped, so delivery is inevitable. The deposit balance for this month is still 3 million yuan short. It is expected that there will be significant changes in the last one or two days before settlement. Yesterday, at the opening, the No. 5 bond was bought up, and retail investors also engaged in bear swaps, with prices rising by about 2 jiao. However, large investors continued to sell the No. 23 bond, causing it to fall by 1 jiao. In the second session, the No. 14 bond was sold off and bull swaps were executed, causing prices to fall slightly by 1 jiao. At the afternoon opening, the market was chaotic, with more gains than losses. The No. 33 bond was bought up, and at the closing, the No. 47 bond was suddenly bought up, with most investors selling, but prices still rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. As a result, only the No. 23 bond's forward price fell slightly by 5 fen, while the rest rose uniformly by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. The total transaction volume was 6.98 million yuan. The price changes are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Bullish Closing, Stocks Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported from New York yesterday (16th) that most stocks rebounded slightly due to bullish closures. However, traders believed that this was just a reaction. The trading volume decreased, which was generally considered good. Public bonds were mixed, and small exchange stocks fell. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.49 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Strong Anticipation of Deliveries This Month - Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Strong, Three-Grade Yarn Soars by 4-5 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market situation has turned stronger because the spot yarn sales have been active recently and sales in southern China have expanded, leading to a tightening of market sentiment. As for yarn deliveries this month, it is said in the market that both Xu and Chen plan to take delivery. At the same time, Osaka three-grade yarn soared by 4-5 yuan, and the market became more invigorated.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Rebounds by 8-9 Jiao. At the opening of the futures market, the market was weak because the foreign cotton market turned sunny and the forecast dropped. Also, the weather turned sunny, and it was predicted that the cotton market would decline. Prices fell by nearly 2.3 jiao. Prices rose for distant months, and the overall market was flat. However, the market suddenly turned strong at the second closing because Osaka three-grade yarn rose by one yuan and spot yarn sales remained robust. It is said that a certain Mr. Jia of the 20th has taken delivery of 2,000 bales this month. The market became strong, and distant months rose. As a result, prices for all months rose by 5, 6, and 7 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, the delivery period for this month's futures was approaching, and there was strong anticipation of long positions taking delivery. In addition, three-grade yarn jumped up by 2 yuan at the afternoon opening, and the market remained strong. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1, 2, and 3 jiao compared to the morning closing price. According to reports, Fei Chu and Yu Da sold 100 bales, Da Feng 600 bales, Minghua 300 bales, Sen Kang 300 bales, Shen Ji 1,450 bales, Yi Cheng 600 bales, Yi Chang 600 bales, Tai Chang 250 bales, Yu Feng 250 bales. Da Fu bought 1,100 bales, Huai Ji 450 bales, Zhen Da 300 bales, Chang Yu 700 bales, He Xing 550 bales, Chang Feng 1,300 bales, Chang Chang 250 bales, and Yong Da 250 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Over 1,500 Bales. Spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, various brokers bought a total of 1,519 bales throughout the day. The prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase volume of each broker is listed below.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Floods In, Futures Cotton Sees Massive Selling</h3>
<p>The cotton market weakened because the weather cleared up, the Indian and American cotton markets trended downwards, and the exchange rate was relaxed, causing the market to fall further. Selling pressure increased, and arrivals of Ningbo Yao cotton remained abundant, so the cotton market was weaker than the yarn market. The latest new prices for all months were discovered.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Both Fall by 2 Jiao. At the opening of the standard flower futures market, prices for all months uniformly fell, and the downward trend intensified. The atmosphere cleared up, the American and Indian cotton markets continued to fall, market sentiment greatly loosened, and selling pressure increased. New cotton from various sources entered the market, and news became crowded. Factories were restricted by financial constraints, and purchases were not strong, so a pessimistic psychology dominated the cotton market. All months fell by 1.3 jiao, and the latest new lows were discovered. At the closing, distant months rebounded by 2.5 jiao. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.5 to 2 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening remained weak, but the yarn market turned strong, and prices rose to 3 jiao at the closing, which was called a rebound. Osaka three-grade cotton rose by 58 jiao. As a result, prices for all months rose or fell by 5 fen compared to the morning closing price. According to reports, Shen Chang sold 1,600 dan, He Xing 1,600 dan, Sen 1,500 dan, Chang Yu 800 dan, Shen Ji 2,200 dan, Yi Chang 2,700 dan, Run Yi Kang 1,100 dan, Xie Cheng 1,200 dan, Yi Shou Xiao 3,800 dan, Xin Cheng 1,400 dan, and Chang He 2,300 dan. Da Fu bought 2,800 dan, Da Feng 2,600 dan, Run Kang 900 dan, Geng Feng 900 dan, Chang Ji 900 dan, Rui Da 2,000 dan, Yuan Yi 3,800 dan, Chang Feng 2,000 dan, Xin Cheng 1,600 dan, and Chang Yu 800 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>New Cotton Arrives in a Flood, Sales Stagnate. Spot cotton consumption remains sluggish. Factories are idle, and the sources include 4,316 bales of Yao cotton and over 1,300 bales of general cotton.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Arbitrage Selling Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, prices for all months fell by 1-2/100 of a cent. Arbitrage selling increased, and retail investors closed out their positions in October. Local brokers sold, and the weather was good, so it was expected that new cotton shipments would increase, which would help with late harvests. The stock market was weak, which were all factors for the price decline today. Japan and Liverpool both lost their ability to maintain prices. Traders absorbed selling at low prices, and the market situation then turned quiet. The closing was flat. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices fell by 3-8 points. Indian cotton European exporters and futures traders sold, and long positions closed out, but this was offset by Japanese purchases. The prices for Pinger fell by 1.15 rupees, Aomura fell by 1.75 rupees, and Bailuo Creek fell by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram recording is on the left (telegram from the 16th).</p>
<p>Also, according to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuo Creek cotton on the 17th was 196 rupees, a decrease of half a rupee from the previous day's closing price. 71 yuan has been opened, and 80 yuan is within sight.</p>
<h3>The Oil Market: White Tung Oil Rises Wildly Nonstop - 71 Yuan Has Been Opened, and 80 Yuan Is Within Sight</h3>
<p>Since white tung oil was sought after by foreign firms, the inventory in the production areas of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei has been shipped out. Last week, there was little to be had in Hankou, and even small quantities of three to five tons were difficult to collect. Even small amounts of ten or five loads in remote rural areas are being scoured for, so prices have skyrocketed. Over the past week, prices have soared from 60 yuan to 70 yuan per load. Foreign firms are not asking about prices, but are only seeking to have goods, so prices are increased with every delivery. According to a telegram from Hankou, Fu Zhong Foreign Firm bought 10 tons at a price of 71 yuan per load, and subsequent deliveries require 72 yuan. After 72 yuan has been opened, further transactions will require even higher prices. Because Hankou merchants can now collect ten or five tons, they can open a transaction with foreign firms, and each transaction will increase the price by at least one yuan, or even two or three yuan. So it is not surprising that prices rise by several yuan in a day, and 80 yuan is probably within sight.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Over 1,500 Bales. Spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, various brokers bought a total of 1,519 bales throughout the day. The prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase volume of each broker is listed below.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>More and Less</h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Rarity makes things valuable. Chinese writers have always held this view. Gu Yanwu opposed writing too much, saying:</p>
<p>"The History of the Sui Dynasty records collections of ancient writings. In the Western Capital, only Liu Xiang had six volumes, and Yang Xiong and Liu Xin had five volumes. These were the most. Others had only one or two volumes. But in the Jiangzuo region, Emperor Jianwen of Liang had as many as eighty-five volumes, Emperor Yuan had fifty-two volumes, and Shen Yue had one hundred and one volumes. What is the point of having so many?"</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Because writing is not valued for its quantity. If there is too much, it cannot be refined. He said:</p>
<p>"The writers of the Two Han Dynasties wrote very little. The history books at the end of their biographies always mentioned the number of works they wrote. Only Dong Zhongshu had as many as one hundred and thirty works, while the rest had no more than fifty or sixty works, or ten or so works, or three or four works. The history books recorded their numbers to commend them, not to criticize their lack. But nowadays, people consider writing a lot to be a sign of wealth. But if there is too much, it cannot be refined. Even if it is refined, it may not be useful to the world. It is appropriate that it is not passed down."</p>
<p>This opinion of "rather less than inferior" is naturally not wrong. For the sake of readers, it is better to read carefully than to dabble superficially. Therefore, it is better to publish less and not to seek every published work to have considerable value, so that readers can benefit. But we must be careful here. We cannot ignore the differences in time and place between modern and ancient times, and think that the ancient people's few works were entirely due to careful consideration, while modern people's many works must be shoddy and made for fame and profit. Gu Yanwu lived three hundred years ago. The printing technology at that time was certainly not as advanced as it is now, so it was not easy to complete a book. If we go further back, the closer to ancient times, the more difficult it was to complete a book. This is not only related to printing technology. The lack of academic development, the scarcity of research materials, and the lack of communication between Chinese and Western cultures were all objective limitations that prevented writers from writing a lot. Therefore, although Gu's opinion is not objectionable in principle, the examples he cited because of his ignorance of the concept of time and place cannot be used as our standard for opposing "shoddy production".</p>
<p>Furthermore, the amount of a writer's output cannot be used as a standard for judging value. Being prolific does not necessarily mean being shoddy, and being concise does not necessarily mean being refined. Take famous writers in Western Europe as an example, such as Tolstoy, Zola, Balzac, Dumas, Dostoevsky, each of whom produced more than a million words. But their literary value is not diminished because of their prolificacy. On the contrary, a collection of essays that took ten years to refine may not necessarily have much artistic value.</p>
<p>In the sixteen years since the May Fourth Movement, China's publishing industry has undergone several ups and downs, with the period from 1928 to 1932 being the most active and prolific. After that, due to the decline of the social economy and certain special reasons, the publishing industry completely sank into a state of lethargy. At this moment, it has reached the extreme of decline, and new works are not seen in the literary world. But on the other hand, the youth's desire for knowledge still exists, but due to the contradiction between needs and purchasing power, this need has become a latent consciousness and is not enough to express itself. Therefore, under this unhealthy situation, when we weigh the pros and cons and compare the advantages and disadvantages, I think we should still start from advocating "more" and temporarily put aside the high-sounding rhetoric of those purists.</p>
<h3>Title (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Mr. Mi Qianghu entered a bookstore and stood before a magazine stall made of two long benches and four wooden boards. The stall was neatly arranged with three rows of magazines: red covers; green covers; yellow covers; white covers; some with a yellow bamboo opium pipe and a round-mouthed glass-covered opium lamp, with a red flame like the tip of a brush in the glass cover; others depicting a three-legged incense burner next to an ancient yellow square cup filled with bitter tea… But when Mr. Mi Qianghu, touching his purple tie under his neck, swept his eyes over these, he was drawn to a cover featuring a naked woman with prominent breasts. Across the woman's loose black hair, there were four red Song-style characters: "New Magazine Full." Looking closer, there was a rice-sized blemish on the tip of the woman's nose, revealing a bit of the yellow paper underneath. Although it wasn't as appealing as the copy he had rushed to buy when the magazine was first published the day before yesterday, he still felt it was beautiful, pretty, and particularly outstanding compared to the three rows of magazines arranged there. He reached out a hand, grabbed a copy, and held it to his chest. With the tips of two fingers on his right hand, he opened the cover, revealing the catalog filled with rows upon rows of square black characters, especially the fifth line of the "Fiction" section—</p>
<p>"Her Heart... Mi Qianghu"</p>
<p>Those few words stood out particularly in front of his eyes. Yes, the words were beautiful, so black and shiny, smooth, square, and beautiful. If it were arranged in the first line, then… this string of thoughts suddenly flashed through his mind, and a dreamlike smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. But he immediately became aware, knowing that there were six or seven people standing around the stall, so he quickly bared a row of white teeth, biting down firmly on his lower lip, while holding the magazine up to his nose, tilting it upwards to cover his face completely. He was determined to find the main text of "Her Heart." Just as he reached out with two fingers to clip the lower corner of the magazine, a pale-faced man with a pointed nose wearing a gray flannel doctoral cap suddenly appeared from beside his right shoulder, and the eyes above that pointed nose were shining brightly, staring intently at the catalog that Mr. Mi Qianghu was holding.</p>
<p>"Ugh, you're really annoying!" Mr. Mi Qianghu thought angrily, his face darkening, almost slamming the magazine shut. But another thought immediately flashed through his mind. His left palm held the magazine just like that, and the two fingers of his right hand still clipped the lower corner of the magazine, not turning the page, and also angled the line</p>
<p>"Her Heart... Mi Qianghu"</p>
<p>a little, pointing it directly at the white face's eyes, almost blurting out: "Oh, look!" But the white-faced man with the doctoral cap suddenly stepped back behind his shoulder and disappeared. He turned his face and saw the gray doctoral cap passing behind him, squeezing to the side of his left shoulder, and reaching out with five white fingers to flip through that stack of "New Magazines Full." Mr. Mi Qianghu, very interested, still held the magazine in front of his nose, only squinting his eyes down, and saw that the five white fingers had actually turned to the page with the main text titled "Her Heart," and the black Song-style characters of "Mi Qianghu" appeared shockingly before his eyes again. His heart paused, as if it had risen to his throat. But those fingers immediately flipped those pages again, stopping for a while at an illustration in another article! It was an illustration like this: a woman with long black hair hanging behind her head, her high-bridged face tilted upwards, her two full arms supporting her on a horizontal line behind her back, her two full legs sloping forward, a snow-white naked body in the shape of a "person." The white-faced man's eyes narrowed, and a dreamlike smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. Mr. Mi Qianghu's mouth also smiled slightly, and just as he was about to turn his face away, the fingers flipped back to the front again. Page after page was turned. Oh, turn over two more pages, and you can see "Her Heart" "Mi Qianghu" again. His heart tightened again as if suddenly raised to his throat. One page was turned. Oh, there was only one page left. Turn this page, and the words "Her Heart" "Mi Qianghu" were about to appear. The two white fingers that the hand stretched out were clipped to the lower corner of that page, the lower corner was raised a little, and the two words "Qianghu" could be seen. The two fingers moved slightly. Oh, it was about to be opened. But the fingers suddenly stopped moving. So he shifted his gaze from those fingers and looked up at the eyes under the gray doctoral cap. But these eyes were not looking at the magazine clipped by his fingers, but were looking towards the door, seeing a friend with a pockmarked face, wearing a faded black robe, walking in, swinging his arms. "Oh dear, I've run into this old-fashioned guy again today, I'm sure he's going to borrow money again!" the white-faced man with the doctoral cap thought, quickly withdrawing his hand from the "New Magazine Full," turning his face away, and walking towards a row of bookshelves. Facing the books on the bookshelves, he looked out of the corner of his eye and saw Old Wang walking to the magazine stall where he had just been standing, his lips smiling, extending the claws of his right hand towards the right hand of the person with the purple tie around his neck. The purple-tied Mr. Mi Qianghu paused, frowning and hesitating, thinking, "Who is this?" But he immediately remembered, it was Old Wang, whom he had just met the day before yesterday, and he smiled and said, "Oh!" and stretched out his own right hand.</p>
<h3>Star</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunqiao</p>
<p>"Preparing to be a star again!"</p>
<p>Otherwise, what else is Mr. Ye preparing to do? His arm was slung over the back of the chair, a cigarette held between his fingers. The cigarette smoke drifted lazily in the air. His seat faced the window, and from the brightness of the light through the window, one could tell it was a sunny day, but clouds passed by from time to time. He looked up at the changing flow of the white clouds, like sediment in fresh river water. In such beautiful light, he leaned forward, picked up the small glass mirror from the table, and held it in front of his face, creating an image of himself. Yes, very handsome, thick black eyebrows, a straight nose, well-proportioned lips, a flushed face, not too big a face, not too big a mouth, and not bad-looking in profile. He put down the mirror, stretched his arms, and the joints popped. A large chest, a northern-type man...</p>
<p>"Preparing to be a star again!"</p>
<p>A friend reading a newspaper in the chair opposite him said.</p>
<p>He smiled, feeling a little embarrassed, and a hint of red appeared on his cheeks. Then, using a gesture to compose himself, he said to his friend: "There's nothing that says I can't!"</p>
<p>"When your play is released, I'll definitely be there to support you!" another friend said.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" He leaned over the window, casting a leisurely gaze downwards. It was a street scene.</p>
<p>The large leaves of the plane trees in early August obscured the sunlight in the center of the street, and pedestrians had already donned dark-colored clothing. It was already autumn. Because the place was very remote, there were not many pedestrians on the street. Children collecting garbage were fighting over a tin can. The window of the building across the street was closed and covered in dust, and a "For Rent" sign hung on the door. Mr. Ye was paying attention to the words on it when a sudden noise startled him. Looking, all the pedestrians had stopped and formed a circle, in the center of which stood a yellow-uniformed policeman, tall, a Shandong giant, standing next to him was a young lad. The young lad rubbed his eyes, tears and mud smearing dark circles around them, muttering something. The policeman waved a baton and kicked him in the buttocks. The circle of people dispersed, and the young lad bent down, his eyes fixed on the policeman's hands and leather shoes, frantically picking up the pancakes and fried dough sticks scattered all over the ground. After picking them up, he was taken away. People went back to their own ways.</p>
<p>After watching this scene, Mr. Ye only smiled.</p>
<p>"A small event in the city!" He picked up the mirror and scissors, trimming the stubble on his chin. "The movies are already full of this kind of thing. If I were..."</p>
<p>"Becoming a movie star is a young person's aspiration. But, being a star isn't that easy. You only know that stars can show off, but in reality, instead of that, you should go back to your hometown and see the flood. At least it would be a great help to your understanding of life and the cultivation of a great personality." The friend paused. "You need to know: there are countless examples of young people who get a little empty fame and fall!" After speaking, he went back to reading his newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye tossed the scissors onto the table with a little force: "Another lecture, just like every day!" He looked in the mirror, his hand touching his chin with satisfaction, comfortably gazing at the handsome face inside. Just as he was about to compare a star's face to his own, his friend criticized him again:</p>
<p>"Just having a good-looking face can only make you an ordinary person! The conditions for being a star..."</p>
<p>"Damn, here we go again!" He threw down the mirror and went downstairs to wash his face.</p>
<h3>Return</h3>
<p>— Liu Xu</p>
<p>I secretly return with a trembling heart,</p>
<p>Oh! The magnificent land has become a tattered quilt.</p>
<p>Unbearable to recall, my hometown!</p>
<p>Now let only the wanderer at the end of his rope mourn your festering corpse.</p>
<p>The waters of the Bohai Sea are filled with sorrow,</p>
<p>The land bears the scars of pain.</p>
<p>Where is the national soul?</p>
<p>Only the evening wind accompanies the old and broken Great Wall!</p>
<p>Let's loosen our deeply furrowed brows, brothers!</p>
<p>Transform our groans into generous songs,</p>
<p>Let us not endure humiliation and eke out an existence; gather the strength of the downtrodden,</p>
<p>Rebuild our old homeland!</p>
<h3>Letter in Autumn</h3>
<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>I say: Friend! It's good for people to endure a bit of hardship. If you live in a big house, play the piano, sing American Hollywood movie songs, and when you sing until your soul is lost, you fall into a woman's embrace, and indulge in the romantic affairs of child prodigies and goddesses in paradise, although you may be happy for a while, when you are expelled from paradise one day and come down to be a mortal, the pain and embarrassment at that time will be a hundred times more painful than suicide. We, who are used to hardship, although we feel that the taste of hardship is not sweet, we will not have that kind of pain that is a hundred times more painful than suicide – that is without a doubt.</p>
<p>It's not right to be muddled in life. Phrases like "a monk for a day strikes the bell for a day," "have wine today, be drunk today," "take it as it comes," and other similar "muddled words" are sometimes interpreted as the words of "realists," which doesn't seem quite right. However, it might not be a bad thing to be a little muddled at some points. For example, in your letter you say: "I feel almost like a beggar, the autumn wind wakes me up, and I realize that I have nothing!" Being blown by the summer wind in the hot weather, worrying about the autumn wind, or even the winter wind, and weeping all day long, asking everyone: "What should I do? Autumn is coming! Ah!..." People will find you too annoying! When you are blown by the summer wind, do summer things. When the autumn wind wakes you up and you feel that you have nothing, then do autumn work! If you work diligently like this for a year, although you will endure a lot of hardship, your personality will also become great as a result. Your throat, which cannot shout loudly, will also surely roar like a lion or tiger – This, friend! If you feel that the roar of lions and tigers is great, then how proud you should be to have learned to roar like them!</p>
<p>In your letter, you want me to help you, but I, the object of your request, have also been awakened by the autumn wind, and I also feel that I have nothing. Fortunately, I still have a heart of blood that has not been numbed by the miasma of the times, and it is still beating, beating very fiercely.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as "sympathy" between us, "sympathy" will only ruin a young person's ambition. Between us, only when it is cold, we hug each other tightly and learn to roar like lions and tigers – that might be a bit of sweetness to taste.</p>
<p>This is what you asked me to answer.</p>
<h3>Boarding House (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— by J. Joyce, translated by Libo</p>
<p>Polly was a delicate nineteen-year-old girl. She had soft hair and a small, round mouth. When she spoke to people, her slightly greenish-gray eyes always liked to look up, which made her seem like a small, innocent statue of Saint Mary. Mrs. Mooney initially sent her daughter to work as a typist in the office of an import merchant, but when an attendant of a county magistrate with a bad reputation came to the office every other day, requesting permission to speak to her daughter, she called her daughter back and made her do housework. Polly was very happy about this idea that she could freely approach young men. At the same time, the young men were also happy to feel that there was a young woman not far away. Naturally, Hongli and the young men often teased each other, but Mrs. Mooney, she was a discerning person, knew that the young men were just passing the time: none of them were serious. This went on for a long time, and then Mrs. Mooney began to think about sending her daughter back to typing, she saw some differences between Polly and a young man. She monitored the two of them, silently and without revealing her intentions.</p>
<p>Polly knew she was being monitored, but her mother's continued silence could not be misconstrued. There was no open discussion between mother and daughter, no open understanding, although people in the boarding house were talking about this, Mrs. Mooney still did not interfere. Polly's attitude was already a bit strange, and the young man was obviously a bit confused. Finally, Mrs. Mooney thought the right moment had come and she intervened. She handled moral issues as a butcher knife handles slices of meat: in this situation, she was confident.</p>
<p>It was a bright Sunday morning in early summer, somewhat hot, but with a fresh breeze blowing. The windows of the boarding house were all open, and the lace curtains were slowly billowing outwards beneath the raised window frames. The clock tower of George Church emitted a continuous chiming of bells, and solitary or groups of worshipers were crossing the small square in front of the church, their self-restrained demeanor and the small books in their gloved hands revealing their purpose. Breakfast at the boarding house was over, and the dining room table was covered with plates, with traces of egg yolk and fragments of bacon and rinds left on the plates. Mrs. Mooney sat in a straw armchair, watching the servant Mary clear away the breakfast debris. She wanted Mary to collect the bread crusts and crumbs, to save them for soaking in the bread pudding on Tuesday. When the table was cleared, the bread crumbs collected, and the refrigerators for white sugar and butter were locked up, she began to recall last night's conversation with Polly. Things were as she had guessed: her inquiry was frank, and Polly's answer was also frank. Of course, both of them were a bit arrogant. Her arrogance was because she was unwilling to accept the news too casually, or as if she had acquiesced, Polly's arrogance was not only because of the irony that always annoyed her, but also because she did not want people to suspect that in her clever innocence, she saw through her mother's inclination behind her forgiveness.</p>

<h3>Sudden Change in Weather</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>This year's Mid-Autumn Festival was truly disappointing! A middle-aged friend, returning from the cinema, caught a lot of wind and rain and was very cold: he said he didn't seem to remember a Mid-Autumn Festival like this before. Indeed, the ancient poems and sayings like "The moon is brightest tonight in the year," "The moon is especially bright at Mid-Autumn," "Half of autumn's glory is shared tonight," and "Ten thousand miles of cloudless sky reflect Kyushu, the most perfect night is like Mid-Autumn," were not only absent this year, but it was a bleak night of wind and rain. What was especially disappointing was that the ninety-plus degree weather in the morning turned into overcast skies, wind and rain, and a sudden drop in temperature to seventy-plus degrees. And yesterday, the lowest temperature was only sixty-six degrees, truly as different as two seasons. Wouldn't this make people exclaim in astonishment?</p>
<p>"The world has changed, everything has changed," you often hear old people sighing about the "decline of social morality" these days. However, to take a step back, this saying makes sense. The world and the times are not static, "everything is in motion," as a great philosopher said long ago. Moreover, in today's society of "some rejoice, some worry," while "wealthy families" are preparing feasts to worship Chang'e and enjoy the bright moon together, how many people think of the disaster areas where mourning cries echo everywhere, and there are tens of millions of innocent victims crying for food? Thus, it is probably because "heaven and earth are moving" and "wind and rain share sorrow" that nature made such a "sudden change" in one day, making a "cry of injustice"— a superstitious argument, perhaps we can borrow it here?</p>
<p>However, this sudden change is not accidental. It is originally the relationship between the high and low air pressure in the east and west. As they say, "Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds," and there is a cause and effect behind it. Looking at the international situation, the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, which has been causing anxiety, is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, making it unpredictable. But if we can understand history and face reality, then it is not difficult to understand the essence of all abnormalities. You should know that the "truth" of imperialists is that "there are only three ways to solve the problem of overpopulation (?): one is to redistribute the resources currently occupied by the major colonies, the second is to occupy colonies that are not yet occupied, and the third is to wage war against the current colonial countries..." (See the "People's Daily" comment carried in Havas Rome telegram on the 13th). Therefore, it is not difficult to understand what all the League of Nations meetings, arbitrations, and the efforts of Britain and France are for—bargaining to solve their "overpopulation?"</p>
<p>In short, change, whether it is gradual or sudden, has its causes and basis, even if it comes suddenly or even silently. Look, fortunately, the reasons for this change, all the facts tell us everything clearly!</p>
<p>But, "The world has changed, everything has changed"!</p>

<h3>River Surface at Night</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>The weather in late summer is so sultry that the melting asphalt fumes rising from the roads of the big southern city ripple with the wind blowing from the sea. However, I am a curser of the city, I hate living that depressing and difficult life in the city. For this reason, I just returned to the south, and after only staying in the city for a day, I had to quickly embark on the ship back to my hometown, and started the river voyage again.</p>
<p>Leaving the noisy and chaotic banks of the city, the tugboat slowly sailed towards the quiet countryside. —I love traveling in the twilight of dusk, everything on the earth surrounded by the calm air is so leisurely crawling towards the black and authoritative night, I love the tender red sky reflected by the blood-red and gorgeous colors vomited out by the sunset in the west, and in the middle are azure clouds, these seem like beautiful women sighing and contemplating. It can further stir up the wandering of my melancholic mood—the wandering young people are like duckweed floating on the sea, that's right, at this time, I came back with the traces of self-suffering obtained from afar, the misery of life</p>
<p>I love to imagine our world in such a twilight, everything in life seems to have no fixed point, it is just rolling with the strong wind and drifting with the sea water. (When I look at the trembling brilliance of the sea, I will think like this.)</p>
<p>The boat was still sailing on the calm river surface, but when the twilight gradually became hazy, my eyes seemed to be covered with a light gauze, and I could not see anything clearly, I only knew that the boat was moving forward gently, the river water was rustling, and the shadows of the plants on both banks flashed past in heaps in front of my hazy eyes.</p>
<p>Every time I return to the countryside on the navigation line, I am always so melancholic and sad in the boat, unlike during the day when I can look out at the tranquil scenery on the deck of the boat, I can only hide in front of the small window in the cabin and look at the vast and hazy black sky. The black sky did not tell me anything, and the black river surface did not tell me any terrible horror. Only the medicine sellers in the cabin were shouting with their mouths wide open, what lumbar paralysis, what spirit pills, what venereal diseases, everything was routinely disturbing the hearts of the travelers, every time, I felt that such air was very sad and terrible. However, it was not so easy to sleep in the hot weather of late summer.</p>
<p>However, no matter how I try to eliminate my melancholy and distress, no matter how I try to suppress the trembling of my mood, all the shadows of pain are stirring. Especially this time of hasty return to the south, the pain of life hit me everywhere, all hope turned into terrible dreams, making me feel even more confused about the future. It is as if this time the hope is to get a quiet residence, however, in fact and in spirit it is more painful than before. —Wandering people are always afraid of wandering on the road forever!</p>
<p>In this way, in the cabin, on the river, my mood is like there is no line I can grasp. The disappointment of life increases my southward suffering. And it makes me feel even more that the road of life is crawling like the river surface in the dark night, —a dangerous road that can never be finished!</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>The Slum Courtyard</p>
<p>When you walk to the desolate edge of the city or a secluded alley, you can often see some families with peeling paint on their doors and dilapidated houses. This is mostly the slum courtyard we are going to talk about here.</p>
<p>Walking in through the street gate, you see a large, dirty earthen courtyard. Rubbish and utensils, children and livestock occupy all the space. The nauseating smell of rotten things, human and animal waste, permeates the courtyard. Such a place is home to the vast majority of people in Beiping, and their only resting place in this world!</p>
<p>On three sides of the earthen courtyard are some small and low houses, each housing one family. Parents, siblings, spouses, and children all sleep together on that large heated platform at night. On winter nights, because the days are too short, a clear oil lamp with a flame as small as a firefly might be lit in the house. The night is gloomy, and the day is noisy, in this slum courtyard.</p>
<p>Most of the people living here are laborers, peddlers, rickshaw pullers, coolies, or hawkers – all exploited people. As soon as dawn breaks, they climb out of bed and go out to sell their strength. The children also roll around in the dust on the streets in groups, fighting or scavenging in the garbage heaps. The entire courtyard is a world of women. Or, more accurately, a world of old women, because even the women go out of their street gates for a living during the day.</p>
<p>After the sun sets, the father, pulling an empty cart, returns amidst the longing gazes of the children. Ravaged by hunger and fatigue, the father really has no energy left to hug or kiss them. When there is food, everyone eats in silence; when there is no food, he beats his wife, pinches his children, and curses his neighbors, venting the anger that society has inflicted on him on these people who share the same fate.</p>
<p>When winter arrives, the lives of these people struggling in the north wind and snow are unimaginable. How they cherish warmth! They mend the windows and walls of their rooms with scraps of paper again and again, and then they light a fire with burnt coal balls picked up from the garbage heaps. The small green flames flicker at the mouth of the stove. The small room is so gloomy, and the air is so foul. Sometimes, if they forget to ventilate, the whole family will be forever at rest in the coal gas when they wake up the next day.</p>
<p>The older girls here have no pants to wear, hiding in the house all day, or wearing clothes that they think are quite pretty, going to the streets at dusk to auction off their bodies. The children here are taken out by their parents in the morning and never return. The housewives here are racking their brains for a living when their husbands are snoring heavily, crying sadly for life. Here...</p>
<p>This slum courtyard is their home, and this is their "life"!</p>
<p>Camels on Dusty Ground</p>
<p>Have you read Mr. Lu Xun's "Dust"? Beiping is such an ancient city where dust is flying every day.</p>
<p>Almost all the alleys in Beiping are dirt roads. On weekdays, you step on dust that is deeper than the incense ash in an incense burner. When the wind stops, the dust stirred up by a passing car is like a curtain of smoke, engulfing you in that yellow fog. On windy days, it is even more rampant, drilling into your pores, seeping into your mouth, mixing into your hair, turning you into a mud man.</p>
<p>In these dust-filled streets and alleys, some huge things often appear. They have small heads, small eyes, small ears, and snake-like, soft, and curved necks, with raised humps and extremely long legs. These are camels. They come from beyond the Great Wall. The long journey has tormented and tempered them, and the merciless wind and sand have blinded them. When gusts of wind and sand sweep through the streets, this group of creatures with huge bodies reminds people of Asian storms and Mongolian roars. It raises its head, exerts its strength, and lifts its steady steps, walking slowly step by step. Although the wind and sand have covered its vanguard's footprints, it has not lost its way. It still walks forward, forward!</p>
<p>I think this is the symbol of this ancient city of Beiping. Although Beiping is filled with wind and sand, flying dust, it has not been suffocated by it. It is like this camel, slowly taking one step at a time.</p>
<p>Although slow, there will eventually be a day to reach the light. I curse and bless it, this ancient city!</p>
<h3>Siamese Monks (Overseas Scenery)</h3>
<p>— Fang Qin</p>
<p>Siamese Buddhist customs also say: "The Buddhist temple does not care about secular politics, but monks are more noble than Siamese jade. The Buddhist temple is higher than everything. The Siamese king not only has no control over the Buddhist temple, but often has to visit the so-called living Buddha and receive teachings from the monks. And whenever a king sees any monk wearing a monk's robe, he must pay respects to the Buddha and give a slight bow; the monk does not need to return the salute and can accept it calmly. There is a story recorded in Siamese history about this. The story is: The king met a young monk and paid respects to him with Buddhist etiquette, but the young monk returned the salute in panic, and the monk was then killed. The meaning of the crime was that the king saw a monk wearing a monk's robe and saluted him, as if seeing the Buddha; if the monk returns the salute, it is equivalent to falsely allowing the Buddha to salute the king, which is considered to increase the king's sins. Therefore, the Siamese truly respect monks as their parents.</p>
<p>Therefore, the life of Siamese monks is particularly comfortable. Every family is habitually used to automatically buying</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>and preparing many foods to offer to the monks, and the monks' temples also have to send monks out to beg for alms every day. Almost every family along the way puts something in his bowl. Some nobles, rich people, and the Siamese king often decorate magnificent palaces and invite noble monks to preach the scriptures, and the monks' enjoyment is particularly rich.</p>
<p>What is very unique compared to other countries is that monks can marry wives, which is also quite unique. Ordinary monks can come and go as they please, whether for one year, three years, or ten years, or for life, they are extremely free. It is a common custom to marry a wife after being a monk for three years and then return home, or to become a monk and then come back to marry a wife.</p>
<p>Siam has a conscription system, but those who have been monks for a few months can be exempted from military service. This is also considered one of the preferential treatments for monks. Wealthy people who want to avoid their children from serving in the army will donate a lot of money to a certain monk's temple to have their children register as monks.</p>
<p>Speaking of monks' residences, they are even more different. Large ones are built as magnificent and glorious as palaces. Their dignity and nobility are more admired by the Siamese people than the royal palace in Siam, no less than the supreme power of the Roman Pope in the past. Thus, it is not surprising that there are so many monks who eat for free!</p>
<p>However, monks also have strict hierarchies, just like the layers of society, roughly divided into upper, middle, and lower levels, with the highest being the bishops and living Buddhas. Many monk temples have lecture platforms similar to schools, where senior monks take the stage to preach the scriptures, and lower-level monks must regularly listen to the lectures as a kind of homework, some of whom are called "apprentice monks!"</p>
<p>As for life, there are two different aspects. Each temple is presided over by a senior monk, who controls all income and expenditure. Not every monk can go out to beg for alms, and it is entirely up to the senior monk to assign them. Therefore, in addition to a fulfilling material life, the senior monks want the junior monks to serve them, and also chat with their three wives and four concubines at home.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are exceptionally many Siamese who become monks, and even foreigners and overseas Chinese who have lived in Siam for a long time also become Siamese monks. However, these are called "guest monks" by the Siamese. Although they are treated well, they are not as respected as native monks and are always viewed somewhat differently.</p>

Some people seek stimulation to numb their tormented nerves, while others seek stimulation to experience life and understand the true human condition, isn't that so? In various stimulating scenes, we can see many colorful things of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. Often, behind the joy lies worry. A person needs to receive significant stimulation to have a profound understanding of life. In "Night Fragrance," Hu Die endures all kinds of stimulation. She is seduced by the young master Sun Min, but is exposed by her stubborn father and driven out. Before long, the happy times fly by, and she is unfortunately abandoned by the young master. At this time, she has no choice but to return to her own home, where her father is angered to death. Under these multiple stimuli, she understands that life is just a deception! For the sake of survival, she has to stand at the entrance of the dance hall every night and sell "Night Fragrance."</p>

<h3>Ying Yunwei and Yue Feng's Battle of Wits</h3>
<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>Among the directors of Yi Hua Film Company, Ying Yunwei, the director of "Hero of the Times," and Yue Feng, the director of "Wedding Night," are the most eloquent and humorous. They can manipulate your emotions. If they want you to be happy, you will have to laugh involuntarily. If they want you to be angry, you will have to have your hair stand on end involuntarily. If they want you to be sad, you will have to be heartbroken involuntarily. If they want you to be excited, you will have to dance with joy involuntarily. Therefore, everyone at Yi Hua has a good impression of these two gentlemen.</p>
<p>Since the two gentlemen are good at this kind of "unique talent," they can also properly use it on the actors when directing them during work, and can achieve very good results. For example, when filming a comedy scene, if the actors are experiencing a tragic event at this time and cannot laugh, then as soon as the two gentlemen use this "talent," the actors' emotions are immediately manipulated, and they cannot help but burst into laughter. This is not the author's "reckless talk." Those who have seen the two gentlemen directing a play can attest to it.</p>
<p>To get back to the main topic, to stop saying pointless things, on the day when Yuan Congmei's "Storm" silent film was screened at the company, these two gentlemen, each with their own strengths, were also present to watch. When Ying Yunwei saw Wei Heling's mad scene, he opened the conversation and challenged Yue Feng:</p>
<p>"Old Wei's scene is really well done. It's a hard-style play, which has the same subtle effect as Shang Guanwu's zombie scene in my 'Hero of the Times.' But if this scene were directed by our hard-style director Mr. Yue Feng, it would definitely be more spectacular..." Before he finished speaking, Yue Feng also refused to be outdone:</p>
<p>"Okay, we're all in the same business, why push each other down? Before you've said three sentences, you've already started advertising your own film."</p>
<p>"Calling you a hard-style director is really befitting the name. Who dares to say that 'China Sea Fury' and 'Escape' are not 'hard'? Your new masterpiece 'Wedding Night' must also have hard performances."</p>
<p>The two gentlemen engaged in a verbal battle, one sentence from you, one sentence from me, neither yielding to the other, until "Storm" stopped playing. The two gentlemen smiled at each other and then returned to the director's office, and an extra wonderful scene came to an end.</p>
<h3>Half a Day Beyond</h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>"Sea Burial" Location Notes</p>
<p>In the raging sea, a fisherman's corpse floats. Although the man has been dead for a long time, he still tightly grasps his broken fishing net in his hand. This proves that he was a fisherman who sacrificed himself for fishing in the wind and waves last night. His miserable and terrifying appearance makes everyone cover their faces and dare not look directly. Only the director, Wang Bin, seems to be cold-hearted, subjecting the corpse floating on the surface of the water to his control. If you pay attention to his face, he really looks like Yama, the King of Hell.</p>
<p>Who is the corpse? Who is pretending to be the corpse! This is a valuable record. He is a friend of Wang Bin. This time, he is working on the photography for Tian Yi, and he is also serving as the location manager for "Sea Burial." His name is Liang Yungeng. Because he is a good swimmer, he was asked to play a corpse. When he pretends to be a corpse floating on the sea, no one believes that he is a living person. The realistic portrayal can make you shed tears. Therefore, after filming this terrifying scene, Director Wang still sighed: "Alas! Only Ah Liang would be willing to sacrifice like this, only my Ah Liang would be willing to endure hardships like this, and only he has this swimming skill. If we really replaced him with Tian Fang or Chen Tianguo, I'm afraid they would have been buried in the belly of a fish long ago." Several people who heard him speak couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>"Sea Burial" News</p>

<p>Former Lianhua actor Wen Rong and Diantong actor Liu Shangwen both made guest appearances in several scenes in "Burial."</p>
<p>In addition to the three-inch fishing net brought back from Shandong, five more fishing nets were shipped from Ningbo yesterday for use in "Sea Burial." One of the fishing boats used in "Sea Burial" was self-made, and the other was purchased from the Huangpu beach.</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Wang Manjie, one of the so-called "three major singers" who had a few shots in "The Beginning of Man," is said to be following in the footsteps of Chen Jingfang, who played "Auntie Types," and is going to sea to accompany dancers.</p>
<p>In this era, women with no way out are forced by circumstances on the one hand, and lured by vanity on the other. The only way out seems to be to go to the volcano.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that the platitude "time will tell" can be saved. The most important thing is to produce evidence to determine "the truth once and for all." Otherwise, no matter how flowery the words, they are all superfluous. This is what I think and believe about the "Chen Diao incident."</p>
<p>Diao Gong is a good person. Watching her "scribble" and "scribble" several engagement notices when she was "suddenly excited," one can be more convinced. Although Diao Gong "at least would not treat marriage as child's play in this way."</p>
<p>(My conclusion is this: if Diao Gong's words are credible, and if that reporter did not misunderstand, then Diao Gong is undoubtedly a complete good person.)</p>

<h3>Predictions on the Structure and Style of "1936 Model" New Cars</h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>The excellent structure and novel style of the 1935 model cars have been fully appreciated by us. In our minds, we are extremely satisfied with the strong and flexible engine, the extremely streamlined body, and everything else. It seems impossible to make further improvements. However, the reality is absolutely not like this. The world's automotive engineers will absolutely not be satisfied with the current achievements. As the year 1935 is about to bid farewell, they are racking their brains to plan their "1936 Model" new cars. Recently, American automotive manufacturing expert Mr. Smith published a paper related to the style and structure of the "1936 Model" new cars, detailing the improvements and trends in each part. This is indeed a very valuable and interesting plan, which is described in detail as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The Trend of Engine Structure: In cars before the 1935 model, the design of the engine size was often regarded as an unimportant part. In fact, this is a huge mistake. Bulky engines not only fail to increase horsepower, but also consume excessive amounts of metal, directly increasing the selling price of the entire car. This is the most uneconomical thing. In the 1935 model cars, this drawback has been eliminated as much as possible, because the various parts of the engine have been reduced as much as possible, which not only reduces costs but also reduces the space occupied by the engine, promoting a spacious cabin. However, engineers still have two dissatisfactions with the 1935 model cars: (A) the difficulty of high speed and (B) the difficulty of braking at low temperatures. These two major problems are expected to be completely resolved in the "1936 Model" cars.</p>
<p>The focus of the difficulty of high engine speed is because there was previously a lack of suitable metal and lubricating oil. When the engine runs too fast, the piston moves a lot of times, and a lot of heat will be generated inside the cylinder, which will increase the temperature of the metal and cause corrosion. At the same time, the lubricating oil will vaporize, generating acidic compounds, which will further corrode the cylinder and damage the entire engine.</p>
<p>After many tests and research, a new alloy has now been successfully manufactured. This alloy can not only resist high heat but also is not affected by acidic reactions. However, the value of this alloy is very expensive, so the size of the engine is smaller than that of the 1935 model, but because of the increase in speed, it will absolutely not affect the horsepower.</p>
<p>The difficulty of braking at low temperatures has been experienced by every driver. This is due to the lack of fuel volatility and the sluggishness of the burst system. Now, a "1936 Model" car fuel is being tested, which contains advanced Butone. It is believed that after its adoption, it will be able to eliminate the previous problems.</p>
<p>(2) The Trend of Car Body: The length of the car body will be further extended, which is undoubtedly the case. The distance from the car to the ground will be closer. The width of the car body will gradually become "oval." The engine can be placed at the very front of the car, which is sufficient for the position of the car to be expanded. At the same time, it makes the center of gravity suitable.</p>
<p>In the 1935 model cars, although the car body has been "streamlined" as much as possible, unnecessary edges and corners still exist. The results of wind tunnel tests are often not satisfactory, and there is also a worst phenomenon: that is, each factory uses "streamlining" as a slogan, most of which is advertising in nature, without real effectiveness. This is really bad. Therefore, when designing the "1936 Model" new cars, engineers have stipulated a standard curve to be applied to the "streamlined" car body. This curve is a bit like an oval, and according to the results of wind tunnel tests, it has amazing results.</p>
<p>Steel-top car shells will have further development in the "1936" model cars. Because of the universality of electric welding, seamless car shells will have the best results. The colors of the car body will probably be most welcomed by buyers in ocher and grass green. This is all due to a natural trend.</p>
<p>All accessories, such as braking and braking machines, and the function of levers, will be more agile. Most of the accessories will become more and more automated. The supply of lightning power will be more sufficient due to stronger storage batteries and triode generators. The control of headlights and taillights will be easier. "Non-glare" and strong lights will be a great success on the "1936 Model" new cars.</p>
<p>In short, in the "1936 Model" new cars, we will find the advantages that we have previously ignored, a more perfect structure, and a more thorough design.</p>
<h3>Additional Notes on the Public Automobile Economic Test Held in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>All Four Tests Showed Dodge to be First</p>
<p>This spring, the Peiping Municipal Authorities planned to purchase thirty chassis for public buses to be used on city routes. They decided to conduct multiple economic tests to determine which chassis would be best to purchase. Naturally, these tests primarily compared gasoline consumption. However, during the trials, they also observed the ability to climb hills, the lubrication situation, whether the ride was smooth, and the reaction force of the chassis and springs when loaded with weight. The test mileage was approximately thirty English miles, all within the boundaries of Peiping. However, all types of road surfaces were included. It was intended that the specially selected roads would make the test results as accurate and reliable as possible.</p>
<p>During the tests, representatives from the Peiping Municipal Authorities paid special attention to the amount of gasoline loaded into each vehicle and the amount remaining after the return trip. Before the tests, the gasoline tanks of all participating vehicles were completely drained to ensure no residual gasoline remained. Then, a specific amount of gasoline was added to each tank, and the amount was measured again to ensure complete equality without any differences. The thoroughness of the procedure and the seriousness of the inspection were rare. Therefore, the results were very reliable.</p>
<p>The first test was held on the afternoon of March 31st. Three chassis participated, all of which were empty without any load. The results showed Dodge to have the best performance, using 2.1 gallons of gasoline, averaging 14.5 miles per gallon. The other two chassis used 2.772 gallons and 2.836 gallons of gasoline respectively, averaging 10.9 miles per gallon and 10.7 miles per gallon, both significantly less than Dodge. Subsequently, a second test was conducted on April 22nd on the same route. All participating vehicles were loaded with 6,000 pounds of crushed stone. The results again showed Dodge to be first, using 2.5 gallons of gasoline, averaging 11.7 miles per gallon. The third test was held the following day, with a total of eight types of chassis participating. The championship still belonged to Dodge, using 2.723 gallons of gasoline, averaging 11.02 miles per gallon. Later, there were rumors that a certain chassis had undergone a private test on the same route and under the same conditions, with results that were said to be quite strong. Therefore, for the sake of prudence, the authorities conducted a fourth and final test. All participating vehicles were loaded with 8,000 pounds. The result still showed Dodge to be first, with a performance of 2.615 gallons of gasoline, averaging 11.46 miles per gallon. After these four tests, the Peiping Municipal Authorities decided to purchase thirty Dodge chassis, because Dodge's magnificent and reliable effectiveness and absolute economic efficiency were already clearly demonstrated and far beyond the reach of ordinary vehicles.</p>
<h3>Automobile Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>India to Build Automobile Factory: India seems poised to have an automobile factory constructed in the near future. It is widely rumored that a German trading company will undertake this manufacturing venture. The factory site will likely be chosen in the Salli area, about five miles from the port of Bombay. The initial production plan is to manufacture ten five-seater cars and five buses per day. In late May, Sir Visvesvaraya, the alleged initiator of this plan, reportedly convened a meeting in Bombay to discuss the progress of the project. Over forty investors attended. The capital required to build this factory is estimated at £1,000,000, but it is said that only half of this amount will be needed to start. While the exact location of the factory has not been decided, if Salli is not chosen, a site near Bombay will be selected. Jamshedpur is under consideration because Tata has a steel mill there. However, Bombay, being India's only major seaport, offers the greatest convenience for procuring raw materials and semi-finished goods. The first cars to be manufactured will be five-seater vehicles, as they are considered most suitable for use in India. Initially, production will involve assembling imported parts, which is the focus of the German company. Later, they will begin manufacturing various car parts in India. At that time, the production plan will be to manufacture thirty cars and fifteen buses per day. Currently, body manufacturing has already begun. Merchants in Bombay are installing machinery to facilitate this manufacturing venture, which is expected to be completed in about a month. Currently, India imports automobiles worth £100,000 annually. Investors in this new venture have reportedly suggested that the government impose high tariffs on imported automobiles to provide protection. However, whether the authorities will adopt this proposal remains unknown.</p>
<p>Astonishing Italian Automobile Race: On the 6th of this month, the grand 14th Italian National Automobile Race was held in the Montichiari area near Milan, the Italian capital. More than 50,000 spectators were present. The race track is renowned worldwide for its difficulty. A total of sixteen people participated in the race, but only five reached the finish line. The rest dropped out midway. Italian driver Navorari, driving an Alfa Romeo car, was the most favored, but unexpectedly, the champion was German driver Hans Stuck, driving an Auto Union. He completed seventy-three laps, reaching the finish line in three hours, thirty-six minutes, and fifty-nine seconds. The average speed was 137 kilometers per hour and 0.08. Navorari finished second, with a time of three hours, forty-one minutes, and fifty seconds, averaging 136 kilometers per hour and 0.04. The third place went to a young German named Benterosmeier, also driving an Auto Union. He was four laps behind Navorari. The fourth place went to Malino, driving an Alfa Romeo car, who was six laps behind. The last place went to Tarofi Hong, driving a Borgward car, who was fifteen laps behind. This was the first time a German driver had won the championship, which was unprecedented in previous races. Last year's winners were German driver Karaschewara and Italian driver Fagli, both driving Mercedes-Benz cars. Navorari was once victorious, with a lap time of two minutes, fifty seconds, and six tenths, averaging 154 kilometers per hour and 0.22. This race was extremely difficult from start to finish. When the flag dropped, the two German drivers, Karaschewara and Stuck, were in the lead. The former was two laps ahead of the latter, with Stuck leading the three behind him. By the twenty-third lap, Stuck was in first place, followed by Karaschewara and Navorari. By the thirty-sixth lap, Navorari tried hard to take the lead, and he succeeded once on the thirty-eighth lap. However, Stuck regained the lead two laps later. By the forty-fourth lap, Stuck was in first place, with Navorari closely following. Unfortunately, Navorari's car suddenly caught fire, and Trevors immediately took second place, closely following Stuck's car. By the fiftieth lap, Trevors stopped to give way to Navorari, who then drove to the finish line. However, despite using all his amazing strength, he failed to win. The champion was ultimately German driver Hans Stuck.</p>
<p>Hupmobile Sets New Record: According to Robert, the Pacific Coast Sales Manager of the Hupmobile Automobile Company, the 1935 Hupmobile recently climbed a steep slope on Mount Wilson in high gear with great success. This is the first time a non-expert has driven a high-gear car up an American mountain and set a record. The slope is not only extremely steep, but also very winding and difficult to navigate. The driver was Mr. Polich, an employee of the Hupmobile Automobile Company. He did not originally intend to set any altitude records. During the entire journey, the car's speed averaged within 20 miles per hour. During the climb, the Hupmobile ascended to an altitude of 6,000 feet in 9 1/8 miles, passing through no less than 400 mountain bends, with slopes ranging from 5/10 to 20 percent.</p>
