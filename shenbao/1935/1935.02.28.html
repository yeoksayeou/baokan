<h3 id="c20">對於洋銀行增發鈔票之自衛 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>外國銀行發行鈔票。由來已久。去歳通貨膨脹謡諑盛傳之際。亦曾一度發生洋銀行將先我增發鈔票之説。而如日前報載各節。洋銀行增發鈔票。似已成為事實。查華商銀行未發鈔之前。市上流通之鈔票。與銀幣未鑄前之盡為西洋墨洋者正相同。及華銀行既發鈔票。其信用猶未如洋銀行之堅固。又與墨洋龍洋間之故存軒輊者復相同。其後卒為國人愛國心所驅使。與華銀行力排艱危。堅持信用。其不屈不撓之精神。博得國人之深厚信用。外鈔始稍稍歛跡。然猶未能盡絶。觀於本報廿五日所載之「外商銀行鈔票流通内地調查。」正見倒持之勢已成。權利之失去易收回難。欲加取締。固為法理所許。而為事實上所難能。坐觀其發行無饜。吸收我現金。操縱我金融。妨礙我民族經濟之發展。其痛心為何如。雖然。聞洋銀行自將存銀運往海外之後。常思有以補其闕。而便其活動。於是提高利率。以吸我存欵。增發鈔票。以吮我膏血。但欵項之存與不存。鈔票之用與不用。其權固操之於國人。我國人之有大宗金銀者。不貪其存息之高而往存。見其鈔票者。以其為非華銀行所發而不樂用。彼必無如我何也。若猶存卑劣心理。洋銀行雖不提高利率而亦往存。雖不增發鈔票而樂為使用。則自無可為力矣。</p>
<p>洋銀行既决心有此舉動。恐非空言抗争所能打銷。即發鈔取締。亦非待諸貨幣整理發鈔統一之後。難以收效。然則今日所可為者。仍祗有盡其在我。本來市塲中心理。對於華洋銀行之信用。已是不同。而此次歳尾年首。金融業中波瀾疊起。以及銀根緊急之惶慮。至今猶未盡釋。一般重私利而忘公義者。遂致故態復萌。為虎傅翼。衡其迹可恨。原其心可憫。蓋彼固不知民族經濟之為何物。猶太富商之可為而不可為也。故若存欵不移動。則鈔票之推行難。增發自不可得。鈔票即使增發。而人各有志。持票者見票即使用。兑票者收兑即回籠。徒見其手續繁而無所得。彼亦不欲增發矣。所望各以民族經濟之利害關係為重。銀錢業兑換業工商業一致聯絡。分工合作。則其勢雖張。而我壁壘森嚴。自亦無所肆其技矣。</p>
<p>愚以為今日之所患「不在顓臾而在蕭墻。」吾人果有健全之組織。何虞外力之襲擊。原夫金融恐慌之來。其因多端。而往往先見之於小銀行。故此後關於金融業之監督。自應從謹嚴方面着眼。小銀行之組織亦應勸導其互相合併。以增加其抵抗之力量。至金融業初以為工商業投資為不穩。而移其目光於房地産。今則房地産實行其為「不動産。」周轉無術。亦未見其為穩妥投資。要之。惟生産之建設。在物資貧乏之中國方為切要之圖。金融業舍正道而不由。偏欲岀奇而師以制勝。何能望其有成。結果為他人造機會。則更不值得矣。故此後應移轉其目光。融通其資金於生産事業。以自利利他。直接所以减少洋貨輸入。間接所以削洋銀行之勢力。整齊同業之陣綫。而鞏固信用。不使存户舍而之他。再以不斷之努力。挽回金融業已失之利權。而自保藩籬。能如此。洋銀行有無立足餘地。尚是問題。增發鈔票。更無庸顧慮矣。</p>

<p>外相答：</p>
<p>中日親善最近漸形轉佳、值此機會、可將從來各種誤會為之一掃、王寵惠氏之來日正合乎時機、吾人得以披誠談論彼此所希望、故余信中日關係可使之轉好一層、據王氏以私人資格所談之情形、大致可分為左列三項、（一）中日兩國之關係、須以和平外交工作而使之密接、（二）所謂和平外交乃平等對等之外交、（三）非僅由國家行使此項方針、國民亦非互相融和不可、以上各節、余均表同情、並擬遵循此三大原則進行、余覺將來當可舉其親善之實也、</p>

<p>迄今中日親善之轉佳、事實上非常簡單、在日本方面僅要求中國制止一切排日行為而已、對於中國方面是在乎今後對日親善之態度為何如耳、在目前並無具體問題、至將來之方針頃已説明趣旨矣、對於具體上之問題、今後非特别加以研究不可、現在實未便有所討論、</p>
<p>淸瀨氏問：</p>

<p>永安銀公司、於去秋由從前東北軍政要人莫德惠·王家楨·李杜·等發起、集資百萬、開始營業、舉鄧鏡寰為公司董事會董事長、歐建成任總經理、詎至十二月間、即以週轉不靈、宣告停止營業、一般存户、認其有欺騙情弊、紛籌對付之方策、就中之債權人德隆烟草公司·及彭子燦·朱文奎·姚克明·張蔭記·等、遂對董事長鄧鏡寰、董事王家楨·莫德惠·林康侯·張子廉·葉漢丞·錢幼菊·林秋湖·彭報暉·姜琦·顧春濤·戴克昌·歐建成·等提起</p>
<p>詐欺侵占　之刑事自訴、正由第一特區地方法院進行審理間、而該公司已增聘沈祖福為經理、羅華舫·王永鑫·為副經理、宣傳加厚資力、重行復業、謂對於債務、當行淸償、於是德隆等所控之案、乃暫緩期審究、不意其於上月二十一日復業、僅及三天、忽然第二度停業、此一刹那間、非但前欠各債未曾淸償、且更藉復業美名、又向各界</p>
<p>騙得存欵　頗鉅、蓋沈祖福受聘後、因欲表現其手腕之靈活、特游説其親友、請於復業日、多將現欵送至公司存儲、並與相約、此乃表面帮忙辦法、儘可隨時暗中提取、决不使受損失、若輩經沈委婉懇求、殊覺情難堅却、且以為朝存夕取、當不致擲金錢皆虚牝、爰允所求、不料欵項一入該公司、縱使瞬即往提、竟亦分文不得、此種欺騙技倆、術語謂之「掛紅」、故因掛紅而被倒欠者、實繁有徒、現覺該公司</p>
<p>二度復業　遥遥無期、乃紛紛向第一特院起訴、所列被告、除與德隆等所控相同者外、則加入新任正副經理·沈·羅·王·三人、昨日下午、為彭子燦等所控一案續審之期、而陳生堯·蔣能彪·胡啓慧·冠龍行·馬芳良·等因掛紅被騙一萬四千餘元、</p>
<p>新起訴案　亦同時傳審、惟十餘被告、微特皆不投案、抑且法院送達該公司之各被告傳票、亦均被退轉、祗歐建成之辯護律師到庭、仍稱該公司尚在計劃復業中、要求展期、並謂莫德惠·王家楨·等均擬籌欵三十萬、以期公司之復活、現在滬股東董事、訂期三月一日開會討論、如届時議有辦法、當能實現復業云云、吴則韓推事遂准所請、諭候展期十四天再訊、</p>

<p>從前看金聖歎批的書，往往有「以文生情，以情生文」八個字，不甚明白其真意。近年我學寫文章，往往寫到半路，文思自然從筆底下流岀來，全篇意思，大半是執筆時所未想到的。有時寫小説，寫到一半，把原來計劃的故事的内容改變了，順着筆臨時創造岀新的計劃來。因此原來凖備寫一個惡人的到後來會寫成了一個好人，寫一個好人到後來却變作了壞蛋。順着文字所發生的新的意境而發展故事，可使全篇故事天衣無縫而不露一絲裂痕。若按照了預定的計劃把人物寫下來，固然可以得到最大的成功，但須具有極深的修養，能把握住自己筆下的人物，不為文字造成的新境界所移動，也就是把握了文字不使造成原定計劃以外的新境界。否則全篇都會現岀生硬而不自然。這就是「文情互生」的作用。</p>
<p>因此，我們有時並不想寫什麽長的精彩的文章，只是想着一點意思任意寫去，也會寫成一篇相當好的東西。相同地，有時滿心以為定要寫成一篇有價值的大作時，却到半途抛棄了這殘稿而無法繼續。前者因為自己的文字産生了新的情境（或情調），而後者則僅有死的情境（或情調）而不能産生活的文字來。這也正是「文情互生」的作用。</p>
<p>從事於寫作修養的人，必須訓練自己的文字適合於自己預定的全篇意境（空氣），由這意境引起「情」，而這「情」正所以帮助「文」之發展。「情文互生」而不岀於自己預定的一篇文章的内容的範圍，是完成一篇好作品所必具的條件。可是談何容易呢！</p>
<p>小仲馬寫茶花女劇本的時候，忘記了這個可憐的女人是自己筆下所創造的人物，所以寫到茶花女死的時候他自己先哭了起來。日本女作家平林泰子，她一邊寫小説一邊哭，哭了再寫，寫了再哭，這只是隨手抓來的例證。我相信没有一部文學的傑作不是在這種情形下寫了下來的。</p>
<p>作者對於自己創造的人物不感動，「文情互生」條件是無法完成的。</p>

<p>— 仃</p>
<p>每届歳暮及新春這一段時間内，心裏常常掀起種種不同的變化。一方面，實在感覺日子過得太快，這樣的，會引起心深之懊惱的。一來自己的年紀增大了，人也漸漸的衰老了，事業是一無所成啊！可是一到立春之後，思想又是轉變了，心也好像活躍起來。到了這樣的時候，自己總喜歡對自己説：「過去的讓它一一滚蛋吧！未來的就該好好地振作一下子，努力！重新開始我的工作，不要浪費了寶貴的光陰又虚擲了僅有的生命啊！」</p>
<p>這麽樣説過之後，着實也有一個時候，自己是「專心誠意」，「埋頭埋腦」的去幹過些的，心也衝動過相當時候的。可是不久之後，漸漸地冷淡下來，直至鬆懈到懶洋洋的時候為止。</p>
<p>這樣的又是一年過了一年。</p>
<p>現在雖然不能説是老，或怎樣的頽唐無聊，但却非少年莫俊，精神奕奕那個樣子了。</p>
<p>我想：這是我懶的縁故，不幸之悲哀，失敗的所在，被時代的巨輪輾壓於後面泥土之中的因由。由於我這種苟且偷閒的態度使我着實蒙受着不少的損失，只消事情一到來，在我感覺到了自己學識的淺薄，技能低劣，應用起來不够的時候，心裏便那麽的懊悔呀，傷心呀，難受呀，惋惜呀。…………但這有什麽用哩？</p>
<p>一切的事實使我慚愧。雖然本着良心説吧：我並不是一個怎樣無望的人，而且自己確實曾經艱難困苦地做過一些事情的。但這是如何渺小的啊。</p>
<p>前進吧，過去的祗算幾步開頭而已。前進吧，帶着我這顆曾經用血培養過了的心，默默地前進。</p>
<p>生命應該充滿着火的。我嫌惡我没有火般光芒的生命之力量。然而我願此後實實在在的能够做點事情。勇敢地把我一般的惡習克服，跟着世紀的巨輪滑進。</p>
<p>滑進，直至生命達到了最後一口呼吸為止。</p>
<p>滑進，直至生命達到了最後一滴鮮血為止。</p>
<p>人類的生命永遠繼續不會中斷的。</p>
<p>時間的行程永遠進展不會滯留的。</p>
<p>是不息的進化之演進啊！</p>
<p>我想由鑽石取火而至發明了火柴，由油燈而至電燈，由跑路，坐船，而至汽車，火車，汽船，飛機；由洞穴，蘆舍而至高樓大厦，由生食而至熟食，雜食；由樹葉，麻，皮，而至紗綢綾緞；……這其間不知經過幾許的時間及犧牲了多少的生命才成功的。</p>
<p>這就是文化進步的産物，是人類珍貴經騐之積蓄及智慧之結晶。雖然這些的物質並不能為一般大衆所享受的。</p>
<p>所以，我感覺是人都應該有致力於文化。我感覺工作的人們，才是真正的文化的創造者。</p>
<p>我願我能够這樣，人人這樣。</p>

<p>— 夏時</p>
<p>屋内有火盆，四老爺靠在摇椅上，正和他的女人在烤火。禮生一進門，照例喊一聲：</p>
<p>「四老爺！吃過飯麽？」聲音不自然。</p>
<p>四老爺眼皮向上略一翻，幾聲咳嗽，算是招呼。</p>
<p>禮生隨便在一個凳子上坐下。火爐放在脚下，兩眼直瞪着火盆内的火。</p>
<p>寂然無聲。禮生臉上烘烘然，話在喉内轉。特來算賬，不開口，不行；於是，定一定心，慢吞吞地着力把話從喉内逼岀。</p>
<p>「老爺！算一算？」</p>
<p>「……」老爺眼皮又一翻。停一會，才把身子慢慢撑起，進了房。</p>
<p>他一手拿算盤，一手拿着簿，從房内拿到堂前方桌上。扭亮了燈，翻着簿，算盤打得答答響。</p>
<p>禮生望着翻白眼。</p>
<p>算盤停了響，忽然，似乎平空飛來一個霹靂，老爺在喊：</p>
<p>「禮生！總結，你還欠十五塊！」</p>
<p>十五塊！禮生嚇一跳，直立起來，嚅囁地問：</p>
<p>「欠那麽多？」</p>
<p>「你説欠多少？這是有賬的哪。」老爺馬上現岀不耐煩，接着咳嗽了幾聲。</p>
<p>「共借了十六吊錢；我做了十幾個工，還有蕪草一百捆，兩抵……」禮生自己在盤算。</p>
<p>「欠的租榖不算碼？」老爺忙着補上這一句。</p>
<p>「欠租榖？幾時欠的？」禮生聲音在顫動。</p>
<p>「你不曉得麽？」老爺又咳嗽，指着簿，態度轉和緩。「告訴你吧！去年欠租榖兩石，今年豆租二斗一升，不錯罷？榖算四塊錢一石，一年息，總共九元六角；豆子連息一共算兩塊錢；滿結除下你的工錢和蕪草錢，便是……不會錯的。」</p>
<p>「去年的租榖，不是已經承認讓的嗎？那樣的年歳！」禮生忍着氣，語氣似懇求。</p>
<p>「有那樣容易的事，一讓就是兩石榖。」老爺反而冷笑着，復向摇椅上坐。</p>
<p>「豆租也是讓的！今年連豆種也没有。」</p>
<p>「……」老爺瞌上眼，不做聲，鼻孔哼岀來的，是冷笑。</p>
<p>「除掉這兩筆。看欠多少？」語氣愈懇切。</p>
<p>「……」仍只有鼻孔内的冷笑</p>
<p>「那塊地太壞了，年年要貼租，我不作。」禮生有點忍不住。</p>
<p>「不作那塊地麽？」老爺張開眼，望着他。態度仍安閒。</p>
<p>「不作！我没有本錢貼。」禮生回答，决然。</p>
<p>「真的不作嗎？」老爺仍從鼻孔内笑。</p>
<p>「不作！」</p>
<p>「也好！不作便連田地一概不要作！我的田地，好壞是搭配好了的，我就讓牠荒。」老爺站起來，挾起桌上的簿往房内走。</p>
<p>禮生氣得透不過氣，手脚都在抖。半響，才嚷岀來：</p>
<p>「就一概不作吧！不作田地，看會餓死麽？」</p>
<p>他提着火爐，邊嚷，邊往外跑。</p>
<p>衝過黑暗，跨進了自己的屋。從房内，偷岀一綫光，那是一盞青油燈，忽明忽暗摇曵着，女人在紡綿花。</p>
<p>「太惡了！看就會餓死麽？」他走進房，便往床上坐。臉孔猪肝似的，眼珠向下吊。他喘着氣，愈嚷愈高，好像哭。</p>
<p>女人摸不着頭腦，望着他發怔。</p>
<p>「為什麽？」</p>
<p>「媽的，太惡了，明年一定不作田！」禮生只顧自己嚷。</p>
<p>女人似有些明白，站起來，移近他的身，再問：</p>
<p>「為什麽，四老爺……」</p>
<p>「那老傢伙太惡，明年一定不作他的田！」禮生仍是喘着氣。</p>
<p>「你瘋了麽？總是那樣牛一般的脾氣。不作田，去做什麽？只怪自己窮了」。女人的眼淚快要落下來。繼而，嗅到酒味，又加上：</p>
<p>「好好又要喝酒，醉成這樣」。</p>
<p>「誰喝醉了？」禮生轉眼釘住他的女人，女人太糊塗，不明白自己。「去年承認讓的租榖，今年又要加利算起來，你能忍受得住嗎？」</p>
<p>女人低下頭，眼淚向地下落。「只怪自己窮了，你能閙得過他麽？」説完，索性走回紡綿花的凳子上，抽咽起來了。</p>
<p>「不閙又怎樣？」他是没人心的。他只看到錢。</p>
<p>「總不能不作田啥！」女人抽咽得更厲害。</p>
<p>禮生不再做聲，倒在床上，兩手蒙着頭。起初，他仍是執拗地在憤怒中兜圏子，但後來氣喘畢竟漸漸平靜下來了。他那失去思索力的神經，便被他女人的哭聲提了醒來。不作田，去做什麽呢？於是他轉覺到前面只有一條遥遥無盡的黑暗的路，望不見太陽，望不見田莊，那裏充滿的只是流浪飢餓和死亡。他禁不住地嘆了一口氣，眼淚也自然跟着掉下來。</p>
<p>「我們怎麽辦呢？我們怎麽辦呢？」他像孩子似地瘋狂地喊。（完）</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>這一段彈唱文，依照論語原意，把南方幾個隱者（接輿，長沮，桀溺）和孔門師弟應答的話，加油加醋敷衍開去；不獨是神情逼肖，成為現代化；即全文意義，也成為現代化了。宋元以後的説書人説古事，小説家寫章回小説，大都以敷衍法見長。茶坊中有連説小姐吩咐梅香事，歷一月之久者，可謂極敷衍之能事。最近，在國聞週報十二卷第一，二，三期連載絶聖先生的論語譯文，亦用敷衍法，如譯「古者言之不岀，恥躬之不逮也。」為「古代的人不亂喊口號，駭怕他自己做不到。」，譯「君子周急不繼富」，為「我甯自雪裏送炭，不肯肥肉上抹油！」都敷衍得很好。（「敷衍」本義作「推廣其義」講，今人誤用，乃作「媽虎應付」解。）</p>
<p>「　抬」，「敷衍」可説是粗枝大葉的工夫，再進一步，我來談一談另一種細膩工夫，即所謂「渲染法」。前人作抒情文字，描别離者甚多。江文通别賦，首段云：</p>
<p>「……是以行子腸斷，百感悽惻，風蕭蕭而異響，雲漫漫而奇色，舟凝滯於水濱，車逶遲於山側；櫂容而詎前，馬寒鳴而不息！……居人愁臥，怳若有亡，日下壁而沉彩，月上軒而飛光……</p>
<p>以下接寫富貴别，任俠别，從軍别，絶國别，伉儷别，方外别，狹邪别，乃分段描述。這個題材，一到北宋詞人柳永手裏，又别開新面了。他用各種手法寫離别之精，而各各不相同，如雨霖鈴：</p>
<p>「寒蟬凄切；對長亭晚，驟雨初歇。都門帳飲無緒，留戀處，蘭舟催發。執手相看淚眼，竟無語凝咽。……多情自古傷離别；更那堪冷落淸秋節！今宵酒醒何處？楊柳岸，曉風殘月！……」</p>
<p>絶不用故事來推砌，渲染岀一個外景來構成一幅心理的圖畫，决非江文通那樣粗疎手法所能寫的。後來到了北曲作家手裏，那更不相同了。如董解元西廂記長亭送别一折：</p>
<p>「……雨兒乍歇，向晚風如凛冽，那聞得衰柳蟬鳴悽切！未知今日别後，何時重見也？衫袖上，盈盈揾淚不絶，幽恨眉峰暗結，好難割捨，縱有千種風情何處説；莫道男兒心如鐵石，君不見滿川紅葉，盡是離人眼中血！……衰草凄凄一徑通，丹楓索索滿林紅。平生蹤跡無定著，如斷蓬，聽寒鴻啞啞的飛過暮雲重。憶得枕鴛衾鳯，今宵管半壁兒没用。觸目悽凉千萬種；見滴流流的紅葉，淅零零的微雨，率刺刺的西風！驢鞭半裊，吟肩雙聳，休問離愁輕重，向個馬兒上，駝也駝不動！」</p>

<p>「没有什麽，没有什麽。」胡一元一屁股坐在長沙發上。同時，又請他們二個坐在靠入門那邊二張沙發椅上。「老朋友，也得常常碰碰頭呀！開個房間洗個澡，趁便又得談一談天哪——」</p>
<p>既然是没有什麽事，來此不過白嚼蛆。二個人却不曾預備這一套，便也不免有點茫然了。嘴上擱着很乾燥的笑。隨便向屋子四面看去。於是誰都注意到站在桌角那個大肚子。——一身白紡綢短衫褲，粲粲地裹紥着的大肚子。</p>
<p>「哦！」胡一元重又站了起來。介紹開始了。「這一位，是我遠房娘舅。是個師長資格。——而這位呢，哦！是我日本時代同學，在東亞預備大學裏同學。新文學家，——這位，噯，我的娘舅，你别瞧他人矮腿短，却是個步行全國的好漢呀！真是難得，難得。」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈」跟着這介紹詞而發岀來的，是相互間表示「精誠團結」的一聲哄笑。「哈哈哈！」</p>
<p>於是，房間裏又歸靜寂了。雪流似的白光，熠閃在各人底眼前。相互間又換了個會心的微笑。——實行「幽默」起來了。然而不久，這新文學家終於打破了「幽默」，向大肚子打了個揖；</p>
<p>「貴師是屬於那一軍的？」且還和靄地問。</p>
<p>大肚子像給堵住了嘴，再也回不上來；在杌隉不安中，儘把肚子像地球儀似地轉，轉着，轉着，「不，不，不，」擊鼓似的聲音也一聲二聲地漏了岀來。</p>

<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>在二十年前，似乎還没有民衆教育這個名詞，而提倡國貨的聲浪，却早甚囂塵上耳熟能詳了；都會的民衆教育，建設比較先一些，然而所收的實效，並未見到顯著的進步，互惠於失學的羣衆，也覺微乎其微，我以為病在「好高鶩遠」四個字，假使勤求實際工作，辦理民衆教育者，絶不會感到如今日的沈悶咧。</p>
<p>民衆教育館，現在已普遍到每個縣城和比較興盛的市集了，但是一踏到這些所在，只看見幾份日報，幾種雜誌，植物標本，和通常的幾色禽獸昆虫，以及一些生理的模型，其餘呢，再也尋不到什麽了；這些陳設，成了民教館的刻版文章，成了辦民教事業者天經地義了，年年如此，歳歳這般，民衆教育的範圍，好像也給教育部編審過的教本一樣；我不是説動植物標本，生理模型等，不配給民衆做增長常識的資料，却以為過於呆板，不是進取民族應有的表現；供職民教館的先生們！不要把它當着吃飯睡覺的傢伙，它是完成優良民族性的利器！民教事業，要當它是一種運動看待，在抽烟閒話之餘，多留辦公室，用的腦筋轉些念頭，何者應興，何者應廢，我們常見到許多民教館，把堂堂的辦公室，認為少數供職人員的俱樂部，絲絃管竹，盡興淸歌漫唱，形同一所「養老院」；當它教育局直轄下的一座小衙門，辦公，休息，神氣活現。</p>
<p>我希望教育當局，把每所民教館，增設一間「國貨陳列室」，精選地方岀産，指導觀衆别識商標，年深日久，地方男女老幼，認淸了一邑的産品，把它推銷到隣縣去，隣縣的土産，輸運到本邑來，這樣川流不息的陳設，國人對國貨的印象，自必日深一日；大家知道舉辦國貨展覧會，要專設會所，要專雇人員，而且為時頗暫，不是每一個小縣財力可及的；今年是學生國貨年，説句老實話，光臨民教館的觀衆，當然以教育界人士及學生為多，不妨先就教育用品陳設，其次兼及家庭日用服飾飲食；建築民衆認識國貨心理，似乎比較灌輸其他常識來得近切呢；不枉費政府公幣，藉此增厚民族經濟陣線，我們不要「好高鶩遠」罷！脚踏實地的來做罷。</p>
<h3 id="c169">談談課本問題 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 鑫泉</p>
<p>在學校裏和學生接觸機會最多的，當然要推到書本；因為不計上課的時候，和課餘的，自習，差不多總離不開的，從此可以知道書本和一般學生關係的密切了。可是話就在此，目今各大書局供給學生們用的課本，十分之九都是用洋貨紙張印刷；在學生國貨年中，學生竟讀那洋紙印成的書籍，豈不是一件矛盾透頂的事？可是要在現代一般書坊裏找一册國貨紙張印成的課本，那麽除了舊式綫裝的四書五經等外，可以説得「簡直没有。」倘若學校把四書五經來作課本，當然是勢所不能；如此豈非弄成僵勢，要讀書祗有洋紙印成的課本，若因不用洋貨而情願輟學，未免因噎廢食，似覺太笨拙了。</p>
<p>實在，這問題的解决，祗要幾家供給課本的書局，改用國産紙張印刷就是啦！不過一般書局對於春季所用的書籍，大多早已印就，若欲改用國産紙張印刷，一時為成本關係，又屬勢難照辦。因此，這問題就覺得難於解决了。可是我們不應該因其「難」，而聽其自然。</p>
<p>「學生國貨年」已在過去的不久開始啦！我們當然希望它今年能有良好的成績，在國貨年中佔着最光榮的一頁。因此樂意把這個課本問題提岀，和各位書局經理，校長先生討論一個適當辦法；使一般學生在這國貨年中，達到「凡屬學生不用洋貨」的目的。</p>
<h3 id="c170">國貨調查以後 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 江淹</p>
<p>墨水</p>
<p>國貨——民生32％大華27％其他2％共61％</p>
<p>非國貨——華脱門20％卞德14％派克3％其他2％共39％</p>
<p>筆</p>
<p>國貨鉛筆——大華％75</p>
<p>非國貨鉛筆——25％</p>
<p>國貨自來水鋼筆——博士12％關勒民9％其他8％共29％</p>
<p>非國貨自來水鋼筆——派克35％康克令20％其他16％共71％</p>
<p>紙（包括練習簿，信紙信封，稿紙等等）</p>
<p>國貨——30％非國貨——70％</p>
<p>在我們五百個人的中學校中，我費了三天工夫，跑遍了教室宿舍，做了個上面的調查報告，這次我只取紙，墨水，筆，三項做範圍，目的是要知道我們的學生國貨年中，這最重要的「文房三寶」，現在已走到了何種地步，也就是我們學生能排斥非國貨的「文房三寶」，現在已有何成績。我的調查雖然不能十分真確，又因為篇幅關係不能分得仔細，不過，我深信這不能不算是學生國貨年開端的一個縮影。</p>
<p>我很欣幸，國貨鉛筆在鉛筆中佔了75％，墨水又佔了61％。同時我也懷疑，舶來品的自來水筆在牠們之間，竟佔了71％的地位，固然，一大部分是以前買的，但在學生國貨年中，我們不得不認為這是一個很大的黑點。國貨紙張有30％，我以為是太少，國貨紙張産量，雖然大家知道少的，但是宣告售罄的消息，到底是没有，所以我希望牠的百分比，漸漸地能居於舶來品之上。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來算一算平均數，很簡單的，我們求岀國貨居40％，舶來品居51％，我曾想過：這相差的2％，甚至整個的51％，就是我們學生國貨年的弱點，由這個弱點，一個國家會起一個很危險的貧血症。</p>
<p>總之，學生國貨年的一副担子是重的，這副担子是需要全部的人來負起來</p>

<p>「提倡國貨，固然無分男女，可是，學生們的責任，却尤其來得重大。所以，提倡國貨，先要從學生做起。」這幾句話，是我時常和人談起的。</p>
<p>為什麽提倡國貨，先要從學生做起呢？因為學生是社會的中堅，國家的柱石，他的智識是豐富的，他的心地是純潔的，他的情感是熱烈的，他的行動是勇敢的，社會國家之所期望於學生者，也是非常懇切，提倡國貨，如果能委諸青年學生，我想：一定能有相當的成績表現岀來。</p>
<p>去年是各團體公定的婦女國貨年，娘們努力的結果，雖然不能使我們十分滿意，可是，其宣傳呐喊的功勞，以及把入超的數目字，在無形之間，减少下來，這是不可磨滅的，有人説：「婦女的能力，終究不及男子，所以成績到底不能有顯著的表現。」不過，男子的能力，究竟比婦女高了多少，或是婦女們的能力，是不是真的不及男子，這不但是個教育上的問題，而且是一個男女間的大問題，這裏可置諸不論。同時，在另一方面看來，今年是各團體公定的學生國貨年，學生的成份中間，雖然也有女學生參加其間，而男學生到底佔了絶對的多數，所以，今年的學生國貨年的成績怎樣？大可當作男子能力是否高於婦女的試金石。</p>
<p>可愛的青年學生們呀，你們的偉大的使命，從今天起要開始担負起來了！我很希望你們勇敢的接受下來，要有一個「提倡國貨，非我莫屬」的决心，不論衣呀，食呀，用呀……等等，都要揀國貨的購買，萬萬不能够再馬虎下去了，要知道學生是社會的表率，學生而能切實的服用國貨，那末，人之好善，誰不如我，一般人自然而然也能够轉變其觀念了，這個移風易俗的大效果，真要歸功於可愛可敬的青年學生了。</p>
<p>好，今年是學生國貨年，讓學生們來幹一下吧！我在這裏，先預祝學生國貨年的成功。</p>

<p>過了婦女國貨年，便是挨到我們學生國貨年了。有人會想，學生們所用的外國貨，有限得很，講到讀的書，那麽如果只有外國岀版，也不得不買牠，何必定名為學生國貨年呢？我以為學生是中國的主人翁，將來的一舉一動，對於國家的興亡，有很大的關係，如果在現在的求學時代，對於國貨，有一種認識，那麽將來中國的民族工業，也許更可以振興，為了這縁故，我就寫這篇計劃</p>
<p>一、從本身做去　現現一般提倡國貨的人，穿着外國貸，到處勸人用國貨，你想，這種顧言不顧行的人，怎能够做這工作呢？從本身做去，除了本身可以提倡國貨外，又可以改革社會用洋貨的劣習慣，如果經理穿國貨衣，戴國貨帽，那麽職員也不得不用國貨品了。</p>
<p>二、介紹國貨品　除了本身服用國貨外，還要向不知道有國貨代替品的人介紹。好像你看見你的朋友用外國貨鋼筆，你就應該很恭敬的對他説：老兄，中國貨的關勒銘和新民綱筆，確和外國岀品的差不多，價錢也不貴，中國國貨公司有得買。」那麽、在無形中，你帮助國貨的振興了。</p>
<p>三、參觀國貨工廠　今年我希望乘空暇時，多參觀國貨工廠。一、可以認識國貨界的生活，二可以增進我的智識。這意義是很大的。</p>
<p>四、多讀關於國貨的書和多作關於國貨的文　我預備多買點各地民族國貨工業狀况的書，和海關國貨洋貨進岀口統計的時，前者使我明瞭實况，後者使我知道國貨運動的成敗。因此，我就將許多感想，寫成文章了。</p>
<p>上面四點是我個人計劃，我希望同學們合作起來，做一個有實力的工作。我還希望自己不要虎首蛇尾，没有恒心幹下去。那麽在今年的最末一天，在我自己的日記簿裏，記着：「今年雖依然故我，然國貨工作，稍有成就，參觀工廠已達十四廠，承各廠熱心指導，得益不少。國貨討論會成立已數月，結果甚好，各會員努力合作工作，贊助者頗衆。然進行方針，有待於明年也。」那時，我該多麽快樂呀！</p>
<h3 id="c174">「富貴白頭」 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 彌高</p>
<p>「有資財樂享富貴，有賢妻白頭偕老。」這當然是人生無上的幸福，人們終日奔波忙碌，也無非是為了這樣的目的而已。</p>
<p>可是在現在這國家多難社會不甯的時候，有幾個人能够享到這樣美滿的幸福呢？大部分人還不是在磨難中夭折以死嗎</p>
<p>就像我國實業界聞人項松茂先生，他本來有一個快樂的家庭，然而他却在「一二八」滬變的時候被適慘害了！但是項先生雖然没有享到「富貴白頭」的幸福，他的死却是為國而死—為救人而死，這種犧牲精神實在偉大！他的芳名更可以永垂千古；無怪今年舉行項氏殉難三週紀念的時候參加的人都感動得墮淚了</p>
<p>五洲固本皂藥廠有一種極品香皂，名字就定為「富貴白頭皂」，我想這名字是包含着深刻的意義的，這意義是暗示：提倡國貨，就能富國裕民，如果人人都能購用國貨，那麽利權不再外溢，社會的經濟穩定，人們也都有享受美滿幸福的機會了。</p>
<p>最後我説：「願國人都能一致提倡國貨，願提倡國貨的國人都能富貴白頭</p>

<p>— （顔波光）</p>
<p>每年的春季，總聽得社會上的人們，要推行新計劃，如何如何節省，想法子開源節流。流光忽忽，春的季節過去以後，依然在浪吃浪用，到了年終，還是一個不得了！這，也許是社會上的人們都在實行「一年之計在於春」的計劃吧？</p>
<p>遇事猶豫不决的人們，每喜求籖問卦，測字算命，來指示迷途。這些人真是世上的大傻瓜，因為他能指示你的迷津，難道就不能指示自己的迷津嗎？</p>
<p>這幾天有錢的人們依然有人大請喝春酒，酬酢很忙。窮苦之家，連樹皮草根都没有吃，活活餓死！正是「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨！」的剪影呢。</p>
<h3 id="c213">落燈話 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 張凰</p>
<p>舊俗正月二十四日是落燈節，這天大家小户都要做湯糰吃，呌做「落燈糰子」，各地廟宇前都從元宵節起豎點塔燈，有的祗點三天便罷了，多數經費能力足够的，要連宵點到這天纔收歇。那時，大衆對這祈禱豐年的敬神典禮圓滿—告終—的日期，須得表示一下小小的紀念，做了糰子家人聚食，很有並行分送親友和鄰家的。其實，還不是假借名義，圖暢一番口腹之慾—腹地現得豐收麽？</p>
<p>可是，新年的景致到了正月二十四這天，已成强弩之末，無可留戀；大衆狂歡的氣燄，跟隨着燈火落下，同樣地熄滅，再也不容豎起燃着了！</p>
<p>現在一班略懂英文，喜作華洋合璧的言語的人們，常把「落燈」（一個英文字）嵌入本國話裏説着，「譬如説：『他的賣相真「落燈」咧！』就是説這人的外表太不行。這個英文字「落燈」的意義和落伍相仿，攙進本國語裏，便滿透着歐化（？）的榮光了。或者替這字牽强附會一下，當作比喻那燈到了降落的時候，非但没有了光輝，也不合於時宜了。</p>
<p>落燈是落了，歡娱的日子是截止了，但人們在落燈節後各自加緊事業工作的勇氣，應該是像塔尖的燈光一樣地高據半天，光芒四射，休要不久便墮，自甘躋於「落燈」之列纔得！願大家記着同把落燈自勉啊！</p>

<p>「雪」，原來是豐年的佳兆，然而占候家説：臘裏得雪，那末：來春二麥必熟；所以俗語有句話：「臘雪如被，春雪如鬼，」還呌：「若要麥，見三白，」大意以為得雪三次，是農家最希望的；咦！豈料天公，偏偏不在臘裏降雪，而在春天下了幾次，一樣的雪，而一般人們對他的感想，却有些不同了。</p>
<p>有天區區同老友顧夢飛律師，黄君天白等，因事到西南鄉，倘從航路去，周折太多：於是就在西門外，僱了一隻小船，一個舟子，名呌「喜喜」，向間道以進；這時候，正是春寒料峭，六岀飛飛，不多幾時，恰如白擁藍關，漫云歸去，那舟行，穿過了小橋者不曉得多少，而目的地還遠遠没有望着，忽然瞥見一橋，他的面積和水一般的平，像船也不能穿過，喂！行近倒緩緩的逕去了。</p>
<p>黄君天白，把盞且飲且吟，余也不由得拈成了一句，「雪壓橋心兩岸闊，」因這個當兒，時間已到黄昏，不過彌望一白，所以河邊真與大地不分，煞是好看；余請天白屬對，天白就繼續了下句，「風吹船尾一壺春，」大家浮一大白；後來夢飛片響不語，忽然大呌曰，「有了」，説：風「吹」的「吹」字，殊覺不妥，當易一「回」字，風回轉，酒不至冷而失去暖氣，方切「春」字，吾兩人服他點鐵之功，詩律竟勝於法律，相與轟飲，一會兒，那一位鄉友已在宅前迎候良久，携手同上。</p>

<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咜未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>他雖窮，坐椅子的經騐，總是有的，所以很大意的坐着，却不料坐下去之後，彷彿感到寄子的坐板，隨了屁股，沉下去個窟窿，大概是自己坐得用力太猛了，所以把椅子坐壞了，嚇得他手扶了桌子沿，立刻坐了起來。回頭看時，這算長了一個見識，原來這椅子坐的所在，不是木板，是藤絲編的漏孔網子。在甘肅，總是坐土坑，人家家裏，可以摸岀兩三條方凳來坐，這就了不得了。這小西天裏，實在是考較，客人坐椅子，都不讓他屁股受委屈，竟是想岀花樣來，教人受用，他心裏想着，放岀來猶豫的態度，就很是難看。賈多才笑道：你那樣小脚，還和我們客氣什麽，你就坐下來罷。胡氏反着手伸下去，將椅子的藤網面，摸索了一陣，才慢慢兒的輕輕兒的坐下。賈多才在他遠遠的斜對面坐着，向他看看，又向站在桌子角邊的月英看看，心裏想着，不想這樣的母親，會生岀這美妙的女兒，怪是不怪？那一回，月英坐在這裏，就讓賈多才看得没奈何，不想今天他又是這樣的看起來。不過自己也想破了，若不是讓人看得中意了，怎能够望人家帮忙？這位姓賈的，只要見了面，就釘着睛睛來看，那也就是他有幾分喜歡的樣子，只要他肯要我，就讓他多看一會子罷。害臊有什麽用？吃飯穿衣服，才是要緊呢。心裏這樣的想破了，那也就更不知道害臊，只微微低了頭，手扶住桌子站定。賈多才看他雖是板住了面孔，然而却在白裏透岀血紅來，這分明他還是有那相當的難為情，這也就分外的增加他那一分嫵媚了。（一四四）</p>

<p>我的歸心簡直比一切的人都急，雖然已上了車，兀自還揑着一把冷汗，生恐在這最後的幾分鐘裏頭再會有什麽意外的事變發生，使我們依舊走不脱。但人的心理往往總是很矛盾的：我一面雖然　　　担憂着，焦急着，一面却又牢牢地倚定了車窗，儘往後面瞧着，巴不得真有什麽事變發生。</p>
<p>「噲！德齡！火車立刻就要開了！你不能再望後面看了！這是很不吉利的！」太后瞧我望得太岀神了，心上就不高興起來，便很嚴厲地呼叱着我。我當然不敢請問伊為什麽望後看了就是不吉利：只得立即旋過頭來，端端正正的站着。</p>
<p>還是像來的時候一樣，汽笛也不吹，警鐘也不打，我們的御用列車，便悄悄地輾動了。在它開始輾動的兩三小時以前，這一條京奉路的全綫上，其他的列車，已一律禁止行動了；各處的地方官，也已派了人，在路軌兩旁小心警備着；一切情形，都和來時一樣。所不同的祗是車行的速度。來的時候，太后拚命的吩咐要走得慢，好像是愈慢愈好：現在是反過來要它走得愈快愈好了。不過伊老人家雖然這樣吩咐，司機的人却萬萬不敢就此開足速率疾駛；因為在我們岀發的時候，已曾很嚴厲地警戒過他們，車行時一定不能有劇烈的震動，而火車要行得快，震動便絶對的不能免，於是司機的人為求兩全起見，只得把火車開得比來的時候快一些，比尋常的客車慢一些，這樣是快也快了，震動也不致十分劇烈了！我們看着車窗外面的樹木和田地像走馬燈似的望後面退去，也就知道我們的火車，已確比先前行得快了許多了。（二五五）</p>

<p>那老媪的話，挹雲坐在隔牆的書室中，聽得都很淸楚。但他永不曾料到這非常可憎的老媪，竟就是自己所認為非常可愛的那位吴宫名花佩紅的化身。到今他一想到這件事，心頭依然感到迷惑，再也分辨不淸，那照片中人是否是可愛的？而那俞家的老媪，究竟是否是可憎的？</p>

<h3 id="c219">東山猛將會 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>在東山每個村莊裏可以見到一所猛將堂，門口高高地掛着的那塊匾額上，寫着「上天王行宫」五個金色的大字。我們假如要把全東山的來統計一下的話，劉猛將不過近二十尊，猛將堂倒有着六十處以上呢。因為村莊比較大些的，那末一尊會裏就得分岀東村西村來，在東村西村裏各自造一所，輪到自己一面接會的年頭，就把劉猛將抬到自己的堂裏來，所以猛將堂就有那末的多了。</p>
<p>村民供祀劉猛將的目的，大概説起來都是希望着保佑他們村裏的蠶花好，旱災祈雨，蟲災的時候抬着劉猛將岀來驅一下，蟲害就可立免</p>
<p>每年逢着廢曆的新年裏，平時冷漠的猛將堂裏呈着一番熱閙的氣象，晝夜燈燭輝煌，香火興盛了。天天上小茶館坐板茶的也都會擠到猛將堂裏軋熱閙，直要到正月半謝了將，才得再把猛將堂的門關閉着。</p>
<p>滿山轉，這是每處會裏都要大舉行一次的，抬着幾百斤重的劉猛將，要經過許多高山跟村莊，前面打着鑼，跟着旗傘，到前後山那末的兜一轉。臨到村莊的地方，他們猛將堂門前有着香案抬來迎接，並且在塲上要轉一下機义，這意思算是到這裏已經拜過年了。轉會的人可以歇一下力，吃一些醬煮的黄荳，鹹菜，茶等等。</p>
<p>廢曆年初九那天有着一次很危險的搶會，這是前山各個村莊裏的小猛將總集合。在槎灣村的塘子嶺頭插了兩面劃界為限的虎旗，小猛將視來的先後，須依照着旗綫排列。向午時那邊大榆樹上戤着的黄色大纛旗，給有着蠻力漢子掮了向嶺下飛也似的跑了，跟着每一座小轎在塵霧滚滚裏捻着下嶺了。</p>
<p>據説：不論那個村莊搶到先，那末這個村裏的蠶花好有着十二分把握？可是在他們拚了命搶，有的鞋襪失掉了，有的跌得頭破血流，往往自己在地上抓一手泥敷了創口仍要行會。</p>
<p>東山的猛將會有着如此的習俗，總刮説一句都是祈求着切莫有荒災到臨。可是近年來的東山那一處村裏不在閙着災荒，那一處村裏的村民不在過着飢餓的生活，假使劉猛將能保佑的話，恐怕就没有這種情形吧。</p>

<h3 id="c220">魔術眼鏡 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 甲</p>
<p>中國人真是福氣不小，外國的科學家，剖心揠膽，絞盡腦汁，從科學實騐室一樣一樣地發明岀來，如電燈，汽車，飛機，電影，供我們有錢的人去欣賞，利用，這種福氣，不知中國人幾身修到的。</p>
<p>從前愛克司光初發明時，我便有一種理想，假使把愛克司光配成眼鏡，到賭博塲中去賭博，無論骰子，無論竹牌，均能透視，則勝算獨操，無往不利。可惜外國科學家，不曾替我國人打算，没有發明這樣東西，而只會利用不會發明的中國人，也只有空成存理想，殊為缺憾。</p>
<p>據廿四日巴黎電，年逾古稀之著名物理學家奧古斯特，頃發明一種「魔術眼鏡」將使電影大為改新。奧氏原係發明電影者之一，渠於一千五百種顔色中，覓得兩種，分别製成玻片，配製眼鏡，用以觀一照片，即可窺見實物之形像，而具有主體之感覺。假定戴了這種兩色眼鏡，去觀看電影，和看真正事跡，毫無差别，如電影中有火車疾駛之景，則宛如欲躍岀銀幕，而向觀者迎面駛來也。</p>
<p>假定此種眼鏡，一到上海，生意必定興隆，購者必定踴躍。因為中國人的電影迷，着實深刻，着實起勁，現在没有此種眼鏡，也看得眼花撩亂，目眩頭暈，亦所不惜，倘有此種眼鏡，無論價值如何昂貴，經濟十分為難，就是當去了包脚布，也要去買一付雙光眼鏡來戴戴，這是必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>我想這種「魔術眼鏡」還有一些缺點，範圍未免太狹，因為這種眼鏡僅僅能看電影，方能發生効力，若拿來觀看别樣東實，和别種東西，就不會發生什麽效力。我想把此種眼鏡，拿來改造一下，假定戴了此種眼鏡，能把變幻離奇的社會狀態，浮滑虚僞的人民心理，縱横捭闔的各國外交政策，一齊可以透視岀來，則此種眼鏡，一定更有價值。</p>
<p>或者更發明一種眼鏡，任何物質，盡能改觀，譬如有一醜陋的女子，假定一戴眼鏡，可變成為一絶色女子，如有一件痛心疾首的事，假定戴了眼鏡，便成為一饜心愜理的事，又如有一不共戴天的仇人，假定戴了眼鏡，便如親兄弟一般。我想假定有這樣眼鏡發明，必定還要利市萬倍，大受歡迎。</p>
<h3 id="c221">晨 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>鄉居雜居之二</p>
<p>晚上睡得很甜，醒來已是金黄的陽光探望到床前的時候了。隔壁堂屋裏老夫人低聲地誦着佛號，那喃喃的聲音彷彿有韻味的音樂似的，在這般靜謐的早上的空氣中，我就領會着這像情人的私語貪戀着温暖的被窩不想起床。這友人的書齋，有四扇南向的玻璃窗，太陽温柔地爬到床心了，我仰面迎着這股暖意，為那音樂味的佛號幾乎重復誘進甜蜜的睡鄉。</p>
<p>「奶奶，上海伯伯没有起來？」</p>
<p>那個七歳的孩子在院子中呌了起來，那樣天真，不知他見我遲起覺得驚異，或者獨自個兒玩得不够味，想到我這個孩子氣的伯伯？他奶奶立即停了佛號，似乎她離開了　着香燭的紫檀天然几向小孫兒走去，　那樣低微的聲音禁止他説話。　　骨碌翻起身下床，他們祖孫兩個正在窗前探望我呢。</p>
<p>老夫人先命她孫兒進來，自己在門外説：「吵得伯伯不能安睡。孩子就是這末不懂事！」</p>
<p>「不，醒來了半天，在床上翻了幾頁書。」那樣扯了個慌，一邊我輕輕拍着孩子的頭頂問：「在外面玩？」</p>
<p>「真的？説孩子——倒是被我唸經吵醒了……</p>
<p>「没有的事，没有的事！」我忙笑着迎岀去。</p>
<p>「鄉下人起來得早，空閑着没有事做，唸着經作為消遣，現在可成了習慣了。雲蓀——我的朋友——常説我媽迷信，我却是隨便唸着玩，菩薩那裏管得了這些事呢？」她解釋着。</p>
<p>黄媽從橱房裏捧了面水進來，就插嘴説：</p>
<p>「太太還想修一位孫小姐哩！」</p>
<p>太太没有反對，滿意的笑意透露在她慈祥的嘴角，更覺得被説着了心事般的搭訕説：</p>
<p>「少爺的早飯菜都預備好了，停會搬到書房裏去。」</p>
<p>慈母的愛在我記憶上激盪起來，像那孩子大的時候，傷失了生我的父母，寄居在姊丈家中長大，不復有燦爛的童年生活，更不知慈母的愛的偉大。及至我用自己的體力來養活自己，生命簡直是刀爼上的魚肉，你想求得一些温暖的慈母的愛嗎？</p>
<p>早餐很豐富，都是些可以久藏的鄉味菜肴，恐怕專預備着嚮敬上賓的吧？，時候還是很早，很想到附近去散步，孩子却來拉我到屋後去看果園。</p>
<p>在積善堂後面，經過一條横弄，是他家的橱房，也是一排三間。從左側的小門岀去，是一個菜園及花園兼合的大果園。近處是種着蔬菜，黄媽告訴我他們一個冬天還吃不完這幾畦菜呢？</p>
<p>踏着滋潤的黏士，我們站到一株梅樹之下，樹上盛放着莊雍的淡白花朶，一球球的，送着淸沁的香味，不由地敞開兩手吸滿了整個肺部。醫生忠告我要有那樣一個空曠之地供我休養，感謝上帝，賜於我這勝地。</p>
<p>園四周圍着一列矮牆，彷彿遊歷名山勝景似的遍走了。牆角有十數株桃樹，含苞未放，已經妖冶地摇着她們的腰肢了。允許我住過這個春天，我向天祈禱。</p>
<p>孩子多了個同半也快活地跳躍着，他講了許多天真的故事，直到他祖母喚他去讀書的時候。</p>
<h3 id="c222">開山 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 吴飛</p>
<p>天纔微明，孤山和龜山一帶人家的屋尖上，已經透着一縷縷的炊烟了。</p>
<p>逍遥宫上金林嫂，今天起身是第一個早，當她離床的時候，天還没有發亮，户里是漆黑洞洞的，要點了煤油燈纔好做事。</p>
<p>「德寶爸！起來吧！飯也滚了。」她向着床里睡得死猪似的金林喊，但是生怕驚醒了床角里那纔週歳的孩子！德寶！所以聲音呌得很低。然而金林一天到晚掮了笨重的鐵鎚，在那石磧里和石頭拚命，身子疲勞得委實有些不支了。更其是到了晚上，正想藉這睡眠來，補償他失去的精力；因此他老婆連推帶喊了幾次，還是動也不動的，依然沉沉地睡着。</p>
<p>「天白亮啦！人家都吃了上山飯到礦里去了；你還不起來，自己礦里的一亨輪頭，也得早些開了下來，裝岀去銷銷看……」她喊得不耐煩了，便咕噥着，重要地在他鼻子上揑了一下：「起來呀！」</p>
<p>「嗚　！天亮了嗎？吃力得來！」骨節像給分裂了！」他給老婆揑了一下鼻子，便翻了一個身，摸摸筋骨酸痛得十分利害，然而終於斗的爬了起來。</p>
<p>「日頭三尺高啦！阿狗叔·黄毛公公，他們都上山了；吃力，誰不懂得吃力呢！都是為了三餐牢羹飯啊！」</p>
<p>「哦！他們已經去了！」他趕忙抹了一把臉，坐到破板桌上，三扒兩义的嚥了兩大碗飯，掮起鐵鎚鐵棒就往山上奔馳。他到得礦里，却看見和他做輪流工的長生，金華，阿犬，毛狗，福林等都比自己先到，他們正坐在石巖上拍潮烟。</p>
<p>「你們倒已經來了！」金林走上前一步，把肩上的鐵鎚鐵捧放在地下，喘了一口氣説。</p>
<p>「來了！我們今天還是先開扛頭呢，先打輪頭？」大家照例地向他問。</p>
<p>「我看先下輪吧！反正扛頭煞片没有去路。」金林一隻脚搭在一堵石腦上，盤算了一下，指着四五千噸的一堵石峯對他們説。</p>
<p>「唉！這一輪白石要是在十年以前，怕就少不了二百多塊錢，記得那時候，幾個扛扛煞片的女人，金戒指都戴得連指頭也彎不轉，那些有礦的，撑石頭船的，打山的，那一個不是天天大魚大肉的吃，皮貨綢緞的穿。新年里開起賭來，檯面動不動就是論千論百，唉！現在却幾乎連肚子還裝不飾，真是誰也想不到的！」阿大確實不勝今昔之感，所以便對那排輪頭發起牢騷來。</p>
<p>「咳！現在這門飯也吃滿了，還好同從前比較嗎？如今有了貨還在愁着不能岀銷！有時也許連苦工錢還撈不着落哩！」金林也不覺有些感慨係之！</p>
<p>他們吸了一陣烟，彷彿把全身所有的精力，都由烟的力量趕集了攏來，大家抖擻抖擻精神，拿了各人所應用的傢伙，走上了石巖。</p>
<p>「嗯哼！啊呵！唔唷！」每一個人的力量集中在鐵鎚和鐵捧上，每一個人的精神運用在這雄壯而偉大的呼號上。</p>
<p>砰—砰—砰—石屑飛进在天空，石片爆跳到遼遠，筋在他們體内漲，汗在他們身上淌！</p>
<p>「嗯哼！啊呵！唔唷！」每個人在嘶聲地呼號！呼號……</p>
<p>整個山谷，全給震撼得動摇了！</p>
<p>附註—輪頭，就是石巖，因開下後須用輪木紥了拖下山的，扛頭，有二人，四人，甚至十多人之别，即是言可以抬扛的。煞片，就是五六十斤的石片了。</p>
<p>媽媽！這裡不是有飯吃的嗎？</p>
<p>— 愚言</p>
<h3 id="c223">童養媳 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>「媽，我不去！我一定不去！」女孩兒氣急敗壞的説着，臉上的肌肉，被極度的難受刻成了縐紋，身子倒在母親的懷中。「我受不了家娘（註——即丈夫的母親）的打，家娘打起人來没有輕重，動不動就是一頓木棒！媽，你看我……這一身……」女孩兒脱下了上衣，背上的斑紋，一條紅，一條紫，横豎的參差着，那極度的創痕，映入人們的眼中，誰都要被感動得流淚的。</p>
<p>「乖孩兒，還是聽娘的話去吧！娘是没有辦法，那個忍心丢下你們！不是為了養不活……你們……」母親越説越急，越説越難受，她感覺自己非常罪過，明明地看到自己的女兒身上一攸條的棒痕，明明知道女孩兒是受不了的，但她自己還是呌她的女孩兒乖乖地回去，這不是她自己宣佈了女孩兒的死刑麽？「乖孩兒，我明年一定想辦法接你回來，只要田中不像今年這麽糟，稍微有辦法的話。」母親這麽安慰着。</p>
<p>「不，我不！我一定不回去！你舊年就説有收成接我回來，直到現在還没有……」</p>
<p>「乖孩兒，你不要怪你的娘，你的娘看到家中没飯吃才把你給别人作小媳婦的啊！」</p>
<p>「没飯吃？弟弟又有飯吃」！女孩兒有些氣憤。</p>
<p>「乖孩子，你怎麽説岀這種話來？這樣説來，你的娘倒有偏心了」！母親還是怪柔和的解釋着：「你們女孩兒不能和男孩兒比哩！男孩是要傳宗接代的！你的父親去世時是怎麽的交代我，要我好好的教養你的弟弟，呌我吃草根樹皮也將你的弟弟帶在一起，王家的香火，全靠你弟弟一人承接哩」！</p>
<p>「……」女孩兒没有話説，大概默認了她母親的説法是對的吧？</p>
<p>一個十二歳的女孩兒，照例是應當很天真活潑的；但不知是什麽原故，她却有着一顆蒼老的心了！也許是極度的磨折與非人的生活將她熬成了這樣的吧！的</p>
<p>晚上，月明如水，萬籟皆寂，這該是詩人很好的詩料吧，但是我們的女孩兒却被可怖的回憶所束縛着呢。</p>
<p>是一個晨霧瀰漫的濃秋，那霧大得差不多對面不見五指，而十二歳的童養媳，却摸索到了自家的田塍上拔豆苗叢中的雜草。</p>
<p>霧呢，直到早飯以後二鐘茶才散盡，她因為一個早晨的辛勞，正想預備休息一下。</p>
<p>也許是在地下蹲得太久，她突然的立起來，脚底下一歪，一顆蠶豆苗已被她踏得粉碎了，雖則她自己還没有覺得。</p>
<p>「賤婊子相，一肚皮壞主意！看到老娘呌你拔雜草，你倒故意踏壞蠶豆苗！看我打得死你不」？這突然的聲音，真把她驚得太利害了！她像老鼠聽到貓呌一樣的害怕，渾身都抖起來了。接着，一條木棒已落在她的頭上，背上，脚上……。</p>
<p>那一陣猛烈的毒打，不知在什麽時候才住手的，因為不到二十棒她就暈去了。</p>
<p>已經是午夜以後的兩點鐘了！離天明不到幾個鐘頭呢；天明以後，她就得上家娘家去了。前兩天的舊創還在身上作痛，也許不到幾天，又有新的創痛來替代微微隱去舊的創痛吧！她不敢想，又不得不想。</p>
<p>家娘的面貌好似在黑暗中浮動着：那粗重的眉頭，寛大的嘴巴中狰獰的黄牙，那臉上的横肉，那鬼呌似的尖聲……。</p>
<p>「死鬼，今天才回來！為什麽不死</p>

<p>到娘家去」！她料定了家娘看到了她時的開塲白是這樣的。</p>
<h3 id="c224">南國風光 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 江遠汀</p>
<p>水是天才</p>
<p>在地理書上，對於南國的梧州，引以為特徵的，是所謂「水上市街」。其實這些，在梧州人的眼中，毫無一種特殊的感覺，也許是「司空見慣」的縁故。然而，另外有一種奇蹟，也許是梧州人所不經意的。但是，在我認為南國風光，這應該是第一好景。</p>
<p>在灘江右岸，矗立着白鶴山，山頂便是河浜園，有松林，棕櫚以及翳日的榕樹，無論怎樣溽暑蒸人的炎夏，那兒總是一個淸凉世界。</p>
<p>當我們立在樹陰下憑眺的時候，可以看見梧州是被灕江與西江包圍了三面，這兩條江水就在當前合流了，梧州人特别起了一個名字，呌做「鴛鴦江」。</p>
<p>為了灕江是碧緑的，西江是黄濁的，這兩派水匯合之後，便交流成一幅美麗的畫面。因為距離較遠的縁故，看不見水的流動，河面成為靜的渦流。如果你仔細地鍳賞，便會認岀許多漫畫。在黄濁的水中參入一抹緑色，或者緑色在周圍包着一道黄色，往往形成為解散的，拖長的女人的頭髮，或者一帶遠山，以及其他各種形象，是很富有象徵的詩意的。與空中飛逝着，凝滯着的雲影，對照來看，更是生趣。</p>
<p>假如你承認雲是天才的話，同樣，也該認水是天才。</p>

<p>淸幽雅緻數餘杭。西子湖邊照夕陽。南宋高宗曾駐蹕。建都九帝世稱王。風光畢竟是稱幽絶。景色宜人到處良。君不見山水晴明鴉鵲噪。飛來峯對面有韜光。欣看天竺分三座。雄峻威風萬佛藏。印月三潭成古典。白蘇隄上柳絲揚。吟鞭到此人人駐。為覧湖光山色臧。真個是西子不虚生一世。因名雀噪永流芳。九泉應得呵呵笑。千載悠悠消遺悵長。只可憐乞食子胥成夢境。吴王臺畔為君䘮。可憐他蕭蕭白髮把頭顱斬。遺恨千秋切齒傷。故此是每到深秋來報復。潮頭汹湧向錢塘。其心忿怒是西施計。枉死無端把一命亡。致失江山吴越併。千秋恨事憾綿長。雖然西子泛舟去。歸隱湖山把影跡藏。伍大夫是怒髮冲冠甚。故而汹湧逞潮狂。至今千古相傳下。目為奇情勝蹟彰。誰識當年忠藎客。丹忱浩氣報吴王。一腔怒意什錢塘。</p>

<h3 id="c230">泰山又將來了！原作人生財有道 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 塵雄</p>
<p>在去年（一九三四）九月，「泰山情侣」開映於本埠，打破西片開映紀錄之時，泰山的名字。已經深印在一般影迷的腦海中了。</p>
<p>泰山影片的攝製，始自十九年前—一九一六年第一張泰山影片公映於世，—直到最近的「泰山情侣」，已經是十二次搬上銀幕了。因為每次泰山片岀都能獲利，尤其是「人猿泰山」與「泰山情侣」，而後者又被選入去年十大名片之一，米高梅製片公司方面最近又收買了原作人的第十三泰山劇本，預備今年再來一張泰山獸片，當然，男女主角就是一般影迷們所熱望的韋斯穆勒與瑪琳奧蘇里文了。</p>
<p>泰山不單馳名影壇，在美國無綫電播音界泰山已經成了各播音台採用的戲劇；他也是無數日報讀者常見的鋼筆漫畫，以及十數種日用商品如口香糖，吊襪帶，膠質玩具等的商標記號。這些，無論什麽作者，都很願意做泰山的主人吧。泰山當然會使他的主人名利雙收的，然而這些權利除了原作人愛加拉斯，坡路士Edgar　Rice　Burroughs之外，還有誰來享受呢？</p>
<p>坡路士本來不是一個著作者。一九一二年前他是一個騎兵，鐵路檢查員，淘金者，專賣藥品的經售員，與商店服務所的顧問。一九一○年坡路士從一個朋友的口中聽説寫文稿的人所得的酬報是很豐厚的。於是他就開始筆墨生涯，在各雜誌報章上賣文取稿費，到了一九一二年他初次發表泰山小説第一部呌做「人猿泰山」，在默片時代，有一家影片公司曾把它攝成影劇改名為「洪荒鳥獸記」，是大力士愛摩林肯主演的。這「洪荒鳥獸記」就是默片中收入超過一百萬金的鉅片之一。所以坡路士見了他的泰山小説果然受人歡迎，他就屏棄一切，决定把全部的工夫從事於寫小説了。</p>
<p>十年之後，到了一九二二年，坡路士感覺他的小説被發行人剥削佣金太多了，就組織坡路士公司，自己來印刷發售自己的岀品。坡路士於一九一三年初次寫作泰山小説成功之後，幸虧他有點遠大眼光，早把泰山的名稱向專利局註了册，以後就很安穩地享受着專利的利益了。</p>
<p>坡路士現年差不多六十歳了，但從外表看起來很像一個四五十歳的壯年人。他每天到郊外去騎馬，打網球。他在幾個月前學習駕駛飛機，現在自己備有專用飛機一部。他有一個兒子，已經承繼父業，管理坡路士公司一切行政事務。</p>
<p>坡路士的泰山雖然以非洲做背景，讀過他的小説的人都以為坡路士對於非洲風土人情一定是很熟悉的，其實，這位以描寫非洲小説岀名的著作家却是從來没有到過非洲地方的呢。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c231">評「四健將」 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Band　Plays　On</p>
<p>—南京—</p>
<p>以前，我們接觸過不少的美國體育影片同時，我們也指岀過那些影片都是和一般以飛機，競舟等為題材的作品一樣，用賽球為主要的題材，無非是使影片在緊張的空氣中進行，對觀衆獲得刺㦸的效果，此外乃是没有何等意義的。但是，現在同樣屬於這一類的作品「四健將」，却是較好的一部，這不是説它的内容何等充實，而是在製片技巧上，頗為成功的。</p>
<p>和每一部平凡的影片一樣，這裏的故事是寄托於空想之中，使四個流浪孩子成為四個足球健將。可是比較特色的却是劇作者將他們四人寫得十分親愛，再在其中構成一段戀愛的糾紛，於是這一影片在情感的把握方面，有着很好的成就。</p>
<p>通常的美國影片，常有一種活潑奮發的青年的朝氣同時不能缺少的還有滑稽詼諧，在這裏自然也不會缺少的。這些和足球塲的緊張空氣組織起來，已經使我們覺得導演確能勝任愉快。然而這些不是本片的特點，更主要的我們得指岀凱蒂周旋在湯尼和斯蒂芬之間的愛的悲劇。當湯尼偶然看到凱蒂吻斯蒂芬的時候，他的苦痛，從在病房中的聲明退讓，到岀病房後走錯了路，這一塲戲我們將前面的斯蒂芬送皮篋給凱蒂，凱蒂在斯蒂芬受傷後大罵湯尼等，幾塲戲連繫起來，我們是給它感動了的。此外，他們五人在鄉間，有的下棋，有的作葉子戲，而輕描淡寫的描畫斯蒂芬和凱蒂的愛的嬉戲，湯尼感傷的獨去散步，凱蒂追隨上去，那兩塲戲，無論是空氣或情感，都有很好的成就。</p>
<p>從這些地方，我們固然可以看到導演的成功，同時主要演員如飾斯蒂芬的Stuart　Erwin和在「自由萬歳」中的記者同一個性，他的演技的優秀，是誰都可以體會岀來的。又如第一次見面的女主角Betty　Furness也是演得很好的，她是那樣富於情感的，很自然的將劇中人的個性深刻描畫岀來。</p>
<p>其他如湯尼在以前的影片中，没有何等成就，在這裏也演得還好，可見導演Russell　Mack對於演員的支配，真是很有把握的力量了</p>
<h3 id="c232">三大明星合演的「舊的新盟」 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>這的確是一個難得的機會，瓊克勞馥，克拉克蓋博，勞勃脱蒙高茂萊，三大明星合作的「舊約新盟」Forsaking　All　Others將在南京大戲院和我們見面了，這張影片，已被認為米高美的佳片之一。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥主演女角，她是一個多麽受人愛戴的女星！克拉克蓋博和勞勃脱蒙高茂萊也是兩顆很紅的男星，三個人在一起合作「舊約新盟」的成績如何也，就可想而知了。</p>
<p>佈景的偉大，表演的特岀，都在水凖以上，而除了三大明星之外，其餘的配角，也都是電影界有名的人物。導演范達克是當代好萊塢有數的大導演，在他處理之下，這影片當然更見完美。</p>
<p>故事的取材，描寫一幕三角戀愛的喜劇。蓋博從小和瓊是一雙愛侣，當她自西班牙回到紐約的前夕，在公園路上泣别之時，更曾表示願意嫁他，不過他知道蒙高茂萊是他的情敵。</p>
<p>第二天他接到蒙高茂萊的電報，説是已和一個少女結婚。隔了一年之久，和蓋博心心相印的瓊，忽地愛上了蒙高茂萊，經蓋博幾星期的追求才允和他駕車往鄉間一行。片中於汽車撞壞，更插入很多有趣的枝節，三個主角，都很盡力的表演。</p>

<p>露蘭貝爾斯笑道；「那到不是的。我特為來再看看你。」戴德奇怪道：「你看了我三十年，還不够嗎？」露蘭道：「我有是這樣想……但是……或者我自己錯誤了……我常常自己想，一個賭博家，一定亦是個胆大公正的人，情願犧牲一切，以博取更大的勝利的……」戴德插嘴道：「賭博本來是一個職業，和别的職業一樣的。」露蘭貝爾斯似乎有所感觸的道：「可是我的叔叔—莎拉都加貝爾斯—却就不同了。」戴德納罕道：「你的叔叔！」露蘭貝爾斯且不理他，仍舊自言自語着道；「我常常看見他，接連擲着六個天然，但是他總是統通注上，直等到贏完了，我輸光了。」、</p>
<p>戴德聽了，不覺睁了兩隻大眼驚異道：「喂，你説話好像是個行家似的。」露蘭不覺悽然道：「吃盡苦中苦，方為人上人。這些東西都是上了當得來的經騐。擲岀一個天然，固然是好的；可是擲岀一對蛇眼來却就冰僵了。戴德不覺驚喊道：「神聖的馬克魯爾！」露蘭還滔滔不絶地説道：「所以我要再來看你一看。我向來佩服你的賭品正直，但是我却很失望，你不過是個鐵角，專擲銅子兒的。」</p>
<p>戴德跳起來道：「你聽好了！我不論大小，隨時隨地，都敢和你賭！」露蘭故意逗他道：「二百五，一下子，好不好？」戴德聽了，楞了一下子道：「那太大了。」露蘭做着不屑的神氣道：「我當你是個真賭博的呢。」戴德挺挺腰道：「當然。你有多少錢，我就和你來一下。」露蘭道：「就是二百五十塊吧。」戴德對她看了一下。她知道自己的骰子是靠得住的，於是就毅然答應了。他站了起來笑道：「密司貝爾斯，這是你自己要來的。好吧，我們就上機會堂上去吧。」</p>
<p>他説着，就領頭向着那著名的「後房」走過去。可是他到了門口，又站住了説道：「不興，我不再上你的當。你的手快不過，要搶東西的。」露蘭道：「克拉倫斯，我恐怕那是不會的了。上次是我認輸了，還有什麽話説？我現在不過要些現欵，好岀門去。像我的叔叔一樣，我情願全數注上，一下子作輸贏。」戴德聽了，似乎覺得贏這老太婆的錢，於心何忍。但是，這是她是已送上門的生意，豈有將財神打發回去之理。况且兩百五十塊，亦不是少數。他於是將肩膀聳了一聳。</p>
<p>戴德進了「後房，」就去開抽屜取骰子。露蘭連忙打開她的袋，取岀一張支票來，向桌子上一抛，並且取岀她的兩顆骰子來，很和氣地問道：「我做莊好不好？」戴德還在翻尋他的特别的骰子可是露蘭又問道：「讓我用我自己的骰子吧……我用慣的，運氣好些……：」她説着，聲音都發抖了。她然後笑着，似乎怪可憐的。戴德心想她亦不見得一擲就贏，於是就慨然答應了，隨即拿岀一捲票子來問道：「你注多少？」</p>
<p>露蘭道：「我全數注上。」她手裏拿着骰子，很内行似的向耳朶邊摇了兩摇，並且吹了一口氣，嘴裏喊着：「骰子乖乖的……寶貝要去買雙鞋……」她將手向前一送，兩顆骰子滚了岀來。她隨即喊道：「神聖的狄傑帝！一個天然！騎得好馬！」戴德無法，一捲鈔票已經輸了一大半。他就將其餘的向桌子上一擲，露蘭照樣的拿起骰子來，在耳朶邊摇着，吹了一口氣然後喊道：「骰子！熱下去！」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Central Political Council Yesterday Passed the Case for Protecting People's Lives and Property <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Regulations for the Exercise of Governing Power</p>
<p>A Letter Requesting the National Government to Order Subordinates to Comply</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Political Council held its 446th meeting at 8:00 AM on the 27th. Those present included Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Lin Sen, Kong Xiangxi, Zhou Qigang, Chen Lifu, Ding Chaowu, and more than 30 heads of various ministries and commissions attending as observers. Sun Ke chaired the meeting. The resolutions obtained are as follows: (1) Passed the principle of the Academic Degree Conferral Law and submitted it to the Legislative Yuan. (2) Passed the principle of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System and submitted it to the Legislative Yuan. (3) Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng and Chairman Wang Zhaoming proposed to send a letter to the National Government, ordering all subordinates to earnestly protect the lives, property, and business freedom of the people based on the regulations for the exercise of governing power, and not to infringe upon them arbitrarily. The resolution was passed. (4) The Ministry of Personnel presented a supplementary draft of the Regulations on Performance Evaluation, Rewards, and Punishments for Civil Servants and submitted it to the Legislative Yuan. (5) The resignation of Gan Naiguang, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, was approved, and Tao Lüqian was appointed as Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior. (6) Ratified the National Government's explicit special appointment of Xue Yue as Pacification Commissioner of Guizhou. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Today, Wang and Jiang proposed at the Central Political Council that Article 16 of the Provisional Constitution states, "The property of the people shall not be sealed or confiscated except in accordance with the law," and Article 37 states, "The people shall have the freedom to choose their occupation or business, but the state may restrict or prohibit it by law if it is detrimental to the public interest." Therefore, the property and business freedom of the people are originally protected by the Provisional Constitution and shall not be restricted in any way without legal procedures. However, recently, local officials have often infringed upon the people's property and hindered their business freedom under various pretexts, which is undeniably a disregard for the law. If this is not rectified urgently, how can we rectify official conduct and promote the rule of law? It is proposed that this Council send a letter to the National Government, ordering all subordinates to earnestly protect the lives, property, and business freedom of the people based on the regulations for the exercise of governing power, and not to infringe upon them arbitrarily. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly. The resolution was passed and a letter will be sent to the National Government for handling. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>[Beiping] Prince Suo Ding will go to Datong on the morning of the 28th, then to Mount Wutai to worship Buddha. Wu Peifu visited at 2:00 PM on the 27th, and He Yingqin also paid a personal visit at 4:00 PM, briefly discussing the issue of setting up checkpoints on the Mongolian border to collect taxes. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] In order to thank Chairman Jiang, Prince De specially sent his adjutant Ban Ciniima to bring Mongolian velvet antlers, which arrived in Beiping on the 27th and were handed over to Prince Suo to be presented to Jiang. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The issue of Mongolian tax collection has been ongoing for more than ten days, and there is still no sign of a resolution. The Mongolian side's attitude seems to be gradually softening, but the key still lies with the Sui Province government. This issue is currently being discussed in Beiping. This morning, Xiao Zhenying again invited Shi Huayan, the representative of Sui Province, and Bao Yueqing, the representative of Mongolia, to discuss the matter. The Mongolian side still hopes for fairness. If this matter can be resolved in Beiping, Xiao will not enter Mongolia for the time being. Otherwise, he will go to Bailing Temple in the near future to meet with Prince De and discuss everything. According to relevant sources, there is strong opposition to setting up checkpoints on the Mongolian border to collect taxes. Regarding the Sui Province government sending troops to the vicinity of Bailing Temple to suppress bandits, since there are no bandits, it is hoped that the Sui Province government will withdraw these troops so that the issue can be resolved as soon as possible. Xiao paid a visit to He Yingqin in the afternoon to report everything. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] After mediation from all parties, the situation regarding the Mongolian Political Council's plan to set up checkpoints on the Mongolian border to collect taxes has eased slightly, and it is hoped that they will not insist on their views. However, the key still lies with the Sui Province government. Because Wang Jingguo's troops from the Sui Army previously went to the vicinity of Milong Temple to pursue and suppress the Yang Monkey bandits, now that there are no bandits in the Mongolian border area, the Mongolian side very much hopes that Wang's troops will be withdrawn as soon as possible. The Sui side has not yet made a definite statement on this. Shi Huayan recently came to Beiping as a representative of Fu Zuoyi to report the truth of the matter and coordinate a solution. It is said that he will stay in Beiping for quite some time. Bao Yueqing visited Xiao Zhenying again on the morning of the 27th to discuss the matter. Xiao paid a visit to He in the afternoon to report on the matter of going to Mongolia for investigation, which has not yet been decided. If a decision can be reached in Beiping, Xiao plans to postpone his trip for the time being. It is said that the Mongolian Political Council has not formally approved the establishment of checkpoints, and it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain approval.

<p>A Consensus Has Been Reached on a Solution</p>
<p>Awaiting Yu Xuezhong's Return to Tianjin for a Final Decision</p>
<p>[Beiping] The implementation plan for the unresolved issues in the war zone has been discussed with the Japanese side by Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, etc. during their trip to Tianjin. There have been general results. Japanese military officer Takahashi will participate in this meeting and then go to Changchun to negotiate the return of the Eastern Mausoleum in Malanyu. Yin and others will also return to Beiping immediately. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese side indicated that a portion of the newly formed security team in the war zone should first enter the Luan Yu area for a troop rotation. After a considerable period of time, so that the Japanese side can learn that the security team is indeed well-disciplined and of the correct number, another portion of them will be sent to the Ji Mi area for a troop rotation in two or three months. We did not agree to this, thinking that if they are not sent in, that is fine, but if they are sent in for a troop rotation, then all of them should be sent at once to avoid prolonged problems. Negotiations take time. (Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese side insists that the replacement location for the Yutian security replenishment team should be near the Beining Railway line and must be stationed in one place. Our side believes that the team has disrupted Yutian in the past and advocates that they be stationed in several places to divide their power and not be limited to the railway line. This morning, Yin Tong, Tao Shangming, and Yin Rugeng visited Takahashi at the Tokiwa Hotel to discuss issues in the war zone. In the afternoon, Japanese Deputy Consul Tanaka, Japanese military staff officer Dokyo Kawaguchi, and Takahashi, along with Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, and Takahashi, held another meeting at the Tokiwa Hotel and discussed the replacement of the new security team in the war zone and the reorganization and transfer of the Yutian team for a long time. In the evening, Yin Tong invited Takahashi and Kawaguchi to a banquet at the Beining Reception Office in the French Concession. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the entry of the newly formed security team into the war zone and other issues, Chinese and Japanese personnel have been meeting in Tianjin for days. A consensus has been reached on a solution. After Yu Xuezhong returns to Tianjin, a final decision will be made and implemented in order. On the 27th, reporters visited Japanese military officer Takahashi, who said that he came to Tianjin not only to pay his respects to Commander Umezu, but also to discuss the remaining issues in the war zone with your country's representatives. Now, the number of people and firearms entering the newly formed security team have been generally determined. The original security team stationed in Luandong Yutian will be transferred out for reorganization and incorporation. The remaining details have not been discussed. As for the exact date of the handover of Malanyu and the Eastern Mausoleum, it has not yet been determined, but the principles have been agreed upon. I plan to return to Beiping within a few days after completing my mission here and report to Changchun early next month. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The departure of the war zone security team for replacement and various issues of reorganization and training have been continuously discussed in Tianjin by Yin Tong and others with the Japanese side to implement the measures.

<p>[Nanjing] The case of the auction of Shenxin's seven factories will be discussed at a meeting of the Ministries of Industry and Finance on the 1st. It is planned that the government will contribute funds to repay the HSBC debt. Because the total amount of Shenxin's debt is more than 20 million yuan, and the seven factories are purchased by Japanese merchants, there are problems with all the loans, and it especially affects the government's revenue from unified taxes. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The government has entrusted Finance Minister Kong to find a way to handle the case of the auction of Shenxin's seven factories and has contacted all parties.

<p>[Nanjing] Liu Weichi, the Second Minister of Industry, told reporters who visited him on the afternoon of the 27th that Shenxin Yarn Factory was almost unsustainable last year. At that time, the Rong family was unwilling to accept the government's reorganization plan, which led to deeper debts. Recently, since Shenxin's seven factories stopped production, the government has been planning relief measures based on the petitions for relief from all circles in Shanghai. When the Executive Yuan discussed this matter at a meeting on the 26th, in addition to deciding to plan relief measures by the Ministries of Finance and Industry, Wang also telegraphed Wu in Shanghai to persuade and stop it nearby. Minister Chen had already taken the night train to Shanghai that night to contact all parties. There is no news from Beijing yet.

The repayment of debts has legal procedures, but the ministry has not yet received a detailed report from Shanghai on this matter. As for the court, if it accepts the case, it will handle it impartially. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation after receiving a telegram from Shanghai, and has not yet received an investigation report.

<p>Seeking Instructions from the Government on Governance Policies</p>
<p>Talking about Xinjiang's Loan Situation from Russia</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Gao Xibing, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, arrived in Beijing to talk about reporting to the Central Government on the current political situation in Xinjiang and seeking instructions on future governance policies. Xinjiang's transportation is inconvenient, and it has been affected by the war in recent years. The news from the inland is blocked, and the outside world's speculation does not match the facts. The war in Xinjiang lasted for three years and ended last August. Currently, the army is being reduced in size and the refugees are being comforted. Xinjiang's politics is extremely difficult to govern due to differences in race, language, religion, and customs. In recent years, the provincial government has added deputy directors to various departments, who are selected from outstanding members of various ethnic groups. Also, important figures who preside over East Turkestan are also cooperating with the provincial government. Xinjiang's tax revenue has sharply decreased, and more banknotes have been issued to maintain the situation. At present, the annual expenditure is 300 million yuan, while the tax revenue is only more than 130 million. Please ask the Central Government to provide subsidies. Military vehicles are currently running between Hami and Dihua to undertake commercial transportation. Long-distance bus companies are responsible for the route between Hami and Suiyuan. Xinjiang's diplomacy is also handled by the Central Government. If it is necessary to hire foreign consultants, please file with the Central Government. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Someone asked Gao Xibing about the content of Xinjiang's loan from Russia. Gao replied that Xinjiang borrowed 5 million gold rubles from the Soviet Union to serve as construction funds. It was proposed last year and discussed with Russian representative Svarizh at one time. It was stipulated that the annual interest rate would be 4% and repaid in five years with local products. The draft contract has been drafted. Because there are still conditions that are not suitable, Svarizh has returned the original plan to Moscow for discussion. After the decision, it will be submitted to the Central Government for approval and then signed. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>[Tianjin] The prices of domestic soil cloth, reed mats, straw hats, and braids in North Hebei have fallen sharply, and production feels excessive. Sales outside the customs have been completely cut off due to the repeated tax increases by the false customs. The price of each reed collar has fallen from one yuan to four corners, the price of a bolt of cloth has fallen from three yuan to one yuan and seven corners, and the price of each zhang of straw hat braid is two corners. More than 100,000 people who depend on this for a living have lost their jobs. Tao Shangming specifically talked with Takahashi and asked the false customs to reduce the tariff on domestic goods so that there would be no shortage of goods outside the customs, and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people within the customs could be maintained. Takahashi promised to convey the message. Tao Shangming came to Tianjin from Tangshan this morning and stayed at the Tokiwa Hotel in the Japanese Concession. Yin Rugeng visited in the morning.

<h3 id="e20">Self-Defense Against Foreign Banks Issuing More Banknotes <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Foreign banks have been issuing banknotes for a long time. Last year, when rumors of currency inflation were rampant, there was talk that foreign banks would increase their banknote issuance before us. As reported in recent news, foreign banks seem to have already increased their banknote issuance. Before Chinese banks issued banknotes, the currency circulating in the market was entirely Western silver dollars, just as it was before silver coins were minted. When Chinese banks issued banknotes, their credit was not as strong as that of foreign banks, and there was still a difference in value between them and the Mexican and Dragon silver dollars. Later, driven by the patriotism of the Chinese people and the efforts of Chinese banks to overcome difficulties and maintain credit, their indomitable spirit won the deep trust of the Chinese people. Foreign banknotes began to gradually retreat, but they were still not completely eliminated. As seen in the "Survey of Foreign Banknote Circulation in the Interior" published in this newspaper on the 25th, the trend of holding back the tide has already formed. It is easy to lose rights, but difficult to recover them. It is permissible under the law to prohibit them, but it is difficult to do so in reality. To sit idly by and watch them issue banknotes without limit, absorb our cash, manipulate our finances, and hinder the development of our national economy would be a source of great distress. However, after hearing that foreign banks have been transferring silver reserves abroad, they are constantly thinking of ways to compensate for the deficit and facilitate their activities. Therefore, they raise interest rates to attract our deposits and issue more banknotes to suck our blood. However, the right to deposit or not and to use or not use banknotes rests with the Chinese people. If our people who have large amounts of gold and silver do not deposit them out of greed for high interest rates, and if they see foreign banknotes and refuse to use them because they are not issued by Chinese banks, then they will have no way to harm us. But if we still harbor inferior psychology, and deposit our money even if foreign banks do not raise interest rates, and use their banknotes even if they do not issue more, then there is nothing we can do.</p>
<p>Since foreign banks are determined to take this action, it is unlikely that empty protests will be able to stop them. Even issuing a ban on banknotes will be difficult to achieve results until after currency consolidation and unified banknote issuance. Therefore, what we can do today is still only to do our best. Originally, the market's psychology towards the credit of Chinese and foreign banks was different. And this time, at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, there were repeated waves in the financial industry, and the fear of a credit crunch has not yet completely dissipated. Generally, those who value private interests and forget public righteousness have relapsed into their old ways, adding wings to the tiger. Judging their actions, they are hateful, but understanding their hearts, they are pitiful. They do not know what the national economy is, or what Jewish merchants can and cannot do. Therefore, if deposits do not move, it will be difficult to promote banknotes, and increased issuance will be impossible. Even if banknotes are issued, everyone has their own will. Those who hold banknotes use them immediately, and those who redeem banknotes redeem them and return them to the bank. This only makes the procedure cumbersome and achieves nothing. They will not want to issue more banknotes. It is hoped that everyone will prioritize the interests of the national economy, and that the silver money industry, the exchange industry, and the industrial and commercial sectors will unite, cooperate, and divide their labor. Then, even if their momentum is strong, our defenses will be solid, and they will have no way to display their skills.</p>
<p>I believe that the problem today "lies not in Zhuan Yu, but within the walls." If we have a sound organization, what do we have to fear from external attacks? The causes of financial panic are many, and they often first appear in small banks. Therefore, in the future, supervision of the financial industry should focus on strictness. Small banks should also be encouraged to merge with each other to increase their ability to resist. Initially, the financial industry thought that investing in industry and commerce was unstable, so they shifted their focus to real estate. Now, real estate has become "immovable property," and there is no way to turn it around, so it is not a reliable investment. In short, only the construction of production is the most important plan in a country like China, which lacks resources. If the financial industry abandons the right path and insists on taking shortcuts and seeking victory through ingenuity, how can we expect it to succeed? The result will be creating opportunities for others, which is even less worthwhile. Therefore, in the future, they should shift their focus and channel their funds into productive enterprises, to benefit themselves and others. This will directly reduce the import of foreign goods and indirectly weaken the power of foreign banks. Align the ranks of the industry and consolidate credit so that depositors do not abandon us for others. Continue to work hard to recover the lost rights and interests of the financial industry and protect our own defenses. If we can do this, whether foreign banks will have a foothold is still a question. There is no need to worry about issuing more banknotes.</p>

<p>[London] During today's House of Commons session, Labour MP Mr. Mander brought up the Sino-Japanese negotiations and asked whether a conference of signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty would be convened to discuss the overall situation in the Far East. He also asked whether the British government had explained to the Chinese government the concern and goodwill of Britain and other Western countries towards China. Lord Privy Seal Eden replied on behalf of the government that Foreign Secretary Simon had already made a statement on this issue and could not provide further information at this time. However, the British government would express its goodwill towards China and its concern for the well-being of China whenever there was an appropriate opportunity. He also said that he had no reason to believe that the Chinese government and the Chinese people did not deeply appreciate this. Mander then asked whether the British government was currently cooperating with the American government on matters concerning the overall situation in the Far East.

<p>[London] In the House of Commons today, someone mentioned the Nine-Power Treaty and discussed the Far East issue. Lord Privy Seal Eden, a spokesman for the Foreign Office, avoided answering. The questioner was Labour MP Mandel. His question was, now that someone is alleged to be violating the Nine-Power Treaty and infringing upon China's territorial integrity, what plans does the British government have regarding this? Eden cited Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration of February 10, saying that Britain is currently paying close attention to the situation in the Far East and maintaining the most friendly relations with China. Mandel then asked whether Britain was cooperating with the United States on this matter. Eden replied that this was another matter. Eden then declared to the House of Commons that, according to the Foreign Office, there was no basis for the claim that Poland and Japan were negotiating to conclude a military defense pact. Observers said that this pact would have been of great concern to Britain and other European powers. However, according to Eden, there was no such thing. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Changes in Sino-Japanese Relations; Hirota Reissues Statement to Europe and America <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota issued the following statement regarding his China policy today in the form of a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities. Recent talks between key figures from China and Japan have only discussed general issues of improving Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. There has been no mention of Japan providing financial assistance to China, China withdrawing from the League of Nations, expelling European and American advisors from other organs of the National Government, and joining an East Asian alliance, as reported in the London telegram. (1) Japan, as repeatedly stated, hopes to increase friendship with European countries. At the same time, based on this meaning, it hopes to increase friendly relations between China and Japan. (2) To this day, it is suddenly said that Japan is destroying existing treaties, urging the mobilization of signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty, and proposing the opening of the "Manchukuo" door, causing an uproar in East Asia. What is the motive behind such remarks? It is difficult to understand. (3) The occurrence of this kind of criticism today cannot but raise suspicions that these critics are advocating East Asian peace but actually want to alienate Sino-Japanese relations. (4) The Empire is truly striving for peace in East Asia and friendship between China and Japan, and hopes that all countries will understand Japan's true intentions. (Dentsu Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota, in his foreign policy speech to the 67th Diet, clarified the principles of non-threat and non-aggression towards China. The meeting between Chairman Chiang and Ambassador Arima and Lieutenant General Suzuki, Wang Jingwei's pro-Japanese speech at the Central Political Conference, and Dr. Wang Chonghui's visit to Japan, etc., have shown a rapid and concrete trend towards Sino-Japanese friendship, which is about to return to its normal state. However, the jealousy of European and American countries is gradually increasing. Therefore, the following discussions have arisen:</p>
<p>(1) On the American side, former Secretary of State Stimson's faction is secretly active. (2) On the British side, Lord Lothian advocated in the Times of the 18th that the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty should mobilize to create a force to counter Japan. General Smuts of South Africa even strongly advocated a British-American alliance.</p>
<p>Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota clarified the fundamental spirit of the Imperial Government's China policy in the form of a statement from the authorities and issued the statement. (Dentsu Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>An Understanding Has Been Reached on Cooperation Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Will Proceed Based on Three Principles Going Forward</p>
<p>—Foreign Minister Hirota's Response—</p>
<p>[Tokyo] During today's plenary session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Mr. Kiyose Kikuo raised questions regarding Sino-Japanese issues, which were answered by Foreign Minister Hirota. The question and answer session was as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Kiyose asked:</p>
<p>What is the recent progress of Sino-Japanese friendship, the process of Mr. Wang Chonghui's visit to Japan, and its results? I would like to hear the details.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese friendship has recently improved gradually. At this opportunity, various misunderstandings from the past can be swept away. Mr. Wang Chonghui's visit to Japan was perfectly timed. We were able to frankly discuss what we hoped for from each other. Therefore, I believe that Sino-Japanese relations can be improved a notch. According to Mr. Wang's remarks in a private capacity, they can be roughly divided into the following three items: (1) The relationship between China and Japan must be closely connected through peaceful diplomacy. (2) So-called peaceful diplomacy is diplomacy on an equal footing. (3) Not only must the state exercise this policy, but the people must also be mutually harmonious. I agree with the above points and intend to proceed according to these three major principles. I feel that in the future we should be able to realize the reality of our friendship.</p>
<p>Mr. Kiyose further asked:</p>
<p>I still have in-depth questions. If it is inconvenient to publish them here, please hold a separate closed meeting and provide an explanation.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>The above principles already contain all the issues. Even if a closed meeting is held, there is nothing to talk about. Mr. Wang Chonghui came to Japan in a private capacity to discuss various matters, and there was no concrete discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Kiyose asked:</p>
<p>It is not just about the situation of Mr. Wang's visit to Japan. Can we hear in detail about general China-related issues in a closed meeting?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>The fact that Sino-Japanese friendship has improved to this day is very simple. On the Japanese side, we only ask China to stop all anti-Japanese behavior. On the Chinese side, it depends on their attitude towards Japan in the future. There is no concrete issue at present. The policy for the future has already been explained. It is really inconvenient to discuss concrete issues at present.</p>
<p>Mr. Kiyose asked:</p>
<p>Does the Chinese side have any concrete requests? Is there any discussion or proposal regarding China's current plight?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Chonghui did not make any concrete remarks other than stating the above principles. (Nichiren Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Will Begin Formal Negotiations After Ota Returns to Office</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota met with Soviet Ambassador Yurenlev twice, on the 13th and 18th, to discuss everything related to adjusting Japanese-Soviet relations. On the 23rd, at the request of the Soviet side, he held a third meeting with Ambassador Yurenlev from 3 pm to 6 pm. This meeting was a free discussion of concrete measures to improve Japanese-Soviet relations regarding pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as the extension of the North Sakhalin oil prospecting rights, the revision of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, the establishment of a demilitarized zone on the North Manchurian border, and the establishment of a joint border commission. No conclusions have been reached yet. The meetings are scheduled to continue next week. Currently, Ambassador Yurenlev is negotiating with Foreign Minister Hirota in a personal capacity. After the results of the Hirota-Yurenlev talks determine the content of the official diplomatic negotiations on Japanese-Soviet relations, it is scheduled that after Ambassador Ota returns to his post in Moscow in late March, formal negotiations will begin with the Moscow government. In addition, Foreign Minister Hirota stated in the Diet that he is prepared to conclude a non-aggression treaty when general pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union are resolved, creating an opportunity for such a treaty. Therefore, depending on the outcome of the negotiations after Ambassador Ota returns to office, a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty may be concluded within this year. (Dentsu Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Last August, negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway stalled in Tokyo. At the same time, the Harbin Manchukuo police arrested a large number of Russian employees of the railway, accusing them of sabotage. The Russian side demanded their release, but was unsuccessful. For half a year, it has become the focus of disputes between the Russian and puppet sides. Now, the negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been settled, and the agreement will soon be signed. It is reported that the 38 Russian railway employees who were previously detained have been released by the puppet Manchukuo authorities. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e52">Czech Overseas Chinese Expelled <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>According to the Hua Lian News Agency, a letter from a Czech overseas Chinese businessman states that at the peak, there were about two hundred overseas Chinese in Czechoslovakia, mostly small-scale merchants and peddlers. They sold Japanese-exported goods such as vases, tea bowls, and tablecloths. Their business situation was not bad, with an average annual income of one thousand several hundred yuan per person, which they remitted back to China. However, their living conditions were extremely difficult and they were often bullied by Czechs, which was truly pitiful. Unfortunately, in November 1933, the Czech government issued an order to expel the Chinese, making it impossible for the overseas Chinese to endure hardship and seek sustenance. As of now, only the Five Continents Company remains as a Chinese business in Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, the company's residency and business issues have not been resolved, and it is questionable whether it will be allowed to continue operating in the future. Our country, at the request of the Czech side, established a legation two years ago, sending Liang Long and Gong Jun as acting chargé d'affaires and vice-consul, respectively. They have repeatedly negotiated with the Czech side, but to no avail. All the overseas Chinese have been forced to leave Czechoslovakia. Currently, only the two diplomats, Liang and Gong, are permitted to reside in Czechoslovakia. (January 15th)</p>

Colonial Secretary Lister replied that the Governor of the Straits Settlements had telegraphed to report that the resolution for the contribution had been passed by the non-governmental members of the local Legislative Council. The Straits Settlements previously contributed 4 million pounds annually to the Straits Settlements Defence Fund, and the current 500,000 pounds is in addition to that. A similar donation was made a year ago. The British government has thanked the local Legislative Council, which demonstrates the goodwill and cooperation of the Straits Settlements on issues of common interest to the entire empire, which is commendable. The annual contribution of 4 million pounds is used to maintain the standing army and local volunteer forces in Singapore. (Reuters dispatch dated the 27th)</p>

The index at 31st January reached 90 percent of the average for 1932, 1924 and 1925. This is the highest point since 1933. Production in December last year was 86 percent, an increase of 8 percent compared to January of last year. This was due to increased automobile production, and increased winter employment in factories was also a factor. However, general construction remains lagging behind. The authorities are excited about this improvement, but are also unwilling to comment on future trends. Since the gold clause ruling, business activity has not increased as expected, which is disappointing to many. Some say that the uncertain outlook for legislation is the reason. Commercial recovery depends on heavy industry, but heavy industry remains sluggish. The work relief program, which is considered to revitalize basic industries, is now facing an uncertain fate. According to Wall Street experts, market rallies are unlikely to occur until the work relief bill and other political issues are resolved. However, the general commercial situation is still fairly satisfactory. (Reuters dispatch dated the 26th)</p>

<p>Navy Doesn't Trust Experts' Theories</p>
<p>[Washington] Senior naval officials here today expressed little confidence in the theory put forward by airship expert Dr. Klemin that the crash of the airship Macon was caused by sabotage of the machinery. Rear Admiral King, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, told the licensing committee investigating the airship crash that he did not believe the incident involved sabotage of the machinery. Although sabotage of the machinery is always possible, I really do not believe that this time was related to sabotage. Captain Wiley, the captain of the Macon, previously stated that Dr. Klemin's claim of pouring corrosive acids on metal plates was impossible because the Macon was heavily guarded and inspections were carried out frequently. Dr. Klemin still believes that the cause of the Macon's crash was sabotage of the machinery. Dr. Klemin said today that Captain Wiley should know that it only takes a minute to pour enough acid on the metal plates to completely disable the airship, and then in another minute, the perpetrator can escape unnoticed on board. It is said that the House Licensing Committee will continue to investigate the cause of the incident, and its conclusions will have a significant impact on Congress's decision on whether the United States should build more large military airships in the future. Secretary of the Navy Swanson has stated that he personally does not want to support the continued construction of large airships, but some officials are asking the government to subsidize the construction of one or more national airships. It is reported that the Congressional committee will also study the possibility of this matter. (Guomin News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">General Assembly of the League of Nations Meets in September: China is Expected to Be Elected to a Council Seat <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly will discuss the issue of re-electing China as a council member of the League of Nations in September. It is widely believed that China has a good chance of being elected. Since Japan's withdrawal from the League, there has been no country representing Asia on the Administrative Council. Turkey often considers itself a European country, so it cannot be truly regarded as an Asian country. Although there is no question of China succeeding Japan and occupying a permanent council seat, there is a feeling that a new permanent or non-permanent council seat should be added so that the number of members of the Administrative Council is not lacking, and this new seat should naturally belong to China. South America, including Mexico, occupies three seats on the Administrative Council. The League of Nations feels that the distribution is uneven and is studying ways to remedy this. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, said in an interview with a Reuters reporter today that when China failed to be re-elected last September, he explained these reasons to the representatives of various countries in the League of Nations. He now understands that the executive department of the British League of Nations Union is now strongly urging Geneva to re-elect China as a council member of the Administrative Council.

<p>Eight Million Soldiers Can Be Mobilized Immediately</p>
<p>Publishing a Communiqué is No Less Than a Warning to Germany</p>
<p>Will Resolutely Exercise National Power Over the Weak and Small in East Africa</p>
<p>[Rome] The government recently issued a communiqué stating that, in addition to the reservists of the 1911 class who have been mobilized and sent to East Africa, it does not intend to further conscript reservists into the army. This communiqué is sufficient to ease people's minds. Recently, there have been rumors everywhere that the government will launch a large-scale conscription of reservists to be sent to the north to prevent incidents on the Austrian border. The Supreme Defence Council recently issued a communiqué stating that if a war were to break out, Italy would be ready and prepared, and people's minds began to calm down slightly. The government's communiqué issued today also stated that the Franco-Italian agreement of January 7 and the Anglo-French agreement of February 3, in which Italy indirectly participated, created a foundation for a security system. Italy's participation in this security system also applies to other regions of Europe. Although the claim that Italian troops are concentrated near the Brenner Pass has been repeatedly denied by the authorities, the authorities have always demanded that Italy has the right to set up garrisons in the border area. Although the communiqué issued today did not mention the risk of disputes arising in the current European situation, it is indeed a serious warning to those who seek to disrupt the current international order, indicating that if necessary, the Pan-Italic government will intervene without hesitation. (Havas dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Italian government issued a communiqué yesterday to explain the dispatch of troops to the East African territory of Eritrea, stating that Italy is ready and prepared in both Africa and Europe. The Reuters dispatch from yesterday has already covered this. The Rome correspondent of "Le Petit Parisien" added a commentary, saying that "the Italian government recognizes the Rome and London agreements" as the foundation for the peaceful development of international relations. However, should unexpected changes occur in the European situation, Italy is also prepared for Germany. A reporter from "Le Matin" also made the same argument, saying that "Although Italy is preparing to develop its colonies, its potential military strength is not weakened as a result. If Europe is in trouble, Italy is prepared to deal with everything. Italy's friendly assurance to Britain and France is, at the same time, a solemn declaration to Germany, and its intention is nothing more than this." According to the communiqué issued by the Italian government, Italy can mobilize seven to eight million regular troops in times of crisis. (Havas dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<p>[Rome] "Italy can mobilize eight million soldiers in a very short period of time." This was the warning in the communiqué issued by the Italian government when it dispatched troops from various ports to Italian Somaliland. Officials do not regard this statement as a show of intimidation, but as a formal warning to the small state of Abyssinia, urging it to be prudent and to know that the European powers will never allow themselves to be played with, as the Abyssinian officials are currently adopting an indifferent attitude. The communiqué stated, "It should be known that the current Pan-Italic law forces all men aged 18 to 55 to serve in the military, so Italy can mobilize 37 classes of troops, totaling seven to eight million people." To prevent incidents on the Somaliland border, two divisions have been re-mobilized and concentrated in Naples, ready to depart at any time. "However, Italy's dispatch of troops to Africa is only to increase the defense of the two territories of Somaliland and Eritrea." According to official announcements, Italy has sent tens of thousands of troops to East Africa in the past two weeks. Some observers believe that today's communiqué is intended to warn the Abyssinian King that his 100,000 soldiers cannot resist Italy's millions of well-equipped troops.

<p>Three Battalions of the Italian Fascist Party Arrive in East Africa. [Rome] One battalion of the three battalions of the Pan-Italic Fascist Party army heading to East Africa has arrived in East Africa. The other two battalions have also been transported to East Africa by the "Ganges," landing at the port of Massawa in Italian Eritrea, where they were warmly welcomed by the Italian people. However, the "Vinci," which transported troops from the port of Messina to East Africa, has delayed its departure due to bad weather. (Havas dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires declared during a visit to Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich that Abyssinia was prepared to abandon its demand that the Swedish and Belgian investigation teams currently in the country participate in negotiations to demarcate a six-kilometer neutral zone between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. This investigation team is purely military in nature. The Italian government has already approved this new proposal and has agreed to allow nomadic peoples to enter and exit the area and use the water from the wells there. Italy has not yet commented on Abyssinia's suggestion to invoke the arbitration clause in the Italo-Abyssinian Peace Treaty. Italy is still actively transporting troops and armaments to Italian Somaliland. Italian newspapers believe that this is a necessary step to ensure safety.

<p>Arabs Serve Italy. Milan, Italy: According to reports from here, Italy has a very large indigenous volunteer army in Eritrea, East Africa, which is the largest in the cities around the Red Sea. These people are mostly Arab Muslim warriors, as well as farmers, herdsmen, and miners from British Somaliland. (Guomin News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian Colonial Commander Graziani expressed his views on European operations in Africa. Graziani is a major authority on Italian colonial affairs. Regarding European and indigenous armies, he advocated using more indigenous troops. Firstly, indigenous people are accustomed to the hardships of the tropical climate, while European troops require supplies and replenishment, which are indispensable in every aspect. To achieve perfection, there must be a perfect organization, but this is especially difficult to achieve in guerrilla warfare in Africa. As for the transportation costs of the troops, they are even more enormous. Just looking at the transportation costs in the Suez Canal, it costs 25 francs per person to pass through this canal, and other transportation costs are even greater. Therefore, the use of troops in the colonies is not as good as using indigenous people. (Guomin News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<p>Sweden Avoids Getting Involved in the Vortex. The Swedish officers serving as military instructors in Abyssinia have been ordered by the Swedish government not to undertake other missions in Abyssinia, unless they receive special instructions from the Swedish government. It is reported that Abyssinia requested that one Swedish and one Belgian officer participate in the demarcation committee for the neutral zone, but this was rejected by Italy. The Swedish government's order is a response to this rumor. (Havas dispatch dated the 26th)</p>

Schuschnigg and Berger carried back to Vienna the responses of the British and French diplomatic authorities regarding the future of Austria. For a week, the two met repeatedly with British and French authorities. They announced that they had reached an agreement with France. As for their secret departure from England, it was to prevent communist demonstrations, so there was a large police presence at the station to protect them.

He then described the political and economic situation of Austria and vigorously demonstrated how prosperous the financial prospects of Austria after its independence would be. When the Austrian guests left London, there were strict precautions taken to prevent accidents. Schuschnigg also met with the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom while in London.

<p>[London] Before returning to his country, Austrian Foreign Minister Berger told a reporter from "Le Matin" in Paris: "We are not here to beg for alms. What we are discussing is the political stability and economic recovery of Central Europe based on the Danube River Convention.

After the Austrian cabinet members departed, well-informed sources announced that if the Danube River Convention included a clause prohibiting the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty, it would be extremely opposed by the Austrian government. In addition, Prime Minister Schuschnigg said in response to press inquiries that the Austrian restoration is currently necessary because it is impossible to restore economic prosperity without restoration.

He will then travel to Berlin next week with Lord Privy Seal Eden. After Simon visits Berlin, he will return to London to report the results of the British-German talks to the British Cabinet.

<p>US Soybean Cultivation Successful, Inevitable Competition with Manchurian Beans</p>
<p>Changchun Dispatch: Northeast soybean production has always occupied a leading position in international trade. Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has been in a state of mixed warfare between the Volunteer Army and the Japanese puppet army. In addition, in the past two years, floods have affected various regions, and the rural economy has reached the point of bankruptcy. Soybean production has also declined as a result. Recently, the results of soybean cultivation in various European and American countries have also tended to improve. Countries such as the United States, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Germany all account for a considerable proportion of annual production. Among them, the United States has the highest production. In 1932, it exported 112,700 tons, accounting for one-fifth of the Northeast soybean exports in the same year. Last year, soybeans imported into Japan from "Manchuria" accounted for one-fifth of the total "Manchurian" production, and soybean oil exports to Japan accounted for about three-quarters. The Northeast soybean imports to Europe and the world soybean production, as well as the import volume of various countries, are listed as follows:</p>
<p>As shown in the table above, the United States has achieved the best results in soybean cultivation. Previously, the production was only enough to meet domestic needs. Recently, production has increased and imports to Europe have also accounted for a considerable proportion. Judging from the recent situation, the United States is making more efforts in soybean cultivation and seed improvement, and claims that it can compete with "Manchuria" to compensate for the loss of US wheat production. In the event that US soybeans surpass "Manchuria," the "Manchurian" soybeans under Japanese puppet management will suffer a great blow. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>Telegraphs Sichuan Provincial Government to Take Over Various Generals' Garrison Areas, Expeditionary Headquarters Established as Scheduled, Personnel Designated for Various Positions</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek crossed the Yangtze River at 9:00 AM on the 25th to attend the expanded memorial week of the Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and gave a very earnest speech (full text being organized). He then received Zhang Xueliang, Qian Dajun, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Huang Musong, Chen Cheng, Yu Xuezhong, Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Miao Chengliu, Guo Xipeng, Huang Xiansheng, etc., and inquired about military and political affairs. Huang Musong reported the details of his trip to Tibet. After leaving the headquarters, Chiang inspected the Provincial Government and then returned to Hankou. The Wuchang Expeditionary Headquarters will be formally established on the first day of next month. In addition to Zhang Xueliang as Director of the Expeditionary Headquarters, Qian Dajun as Chief of Staff, and Yang Yongtai as Secretary-General, which were decided earlier, the candidates for the seven directly subordinate departments have also been designated. Generally speaking, the Director of the First Department is Yan Xunfu, the Director of the Second Department is Xiong Zhongtao, the Director of the Third Department is Mi Chunlin, the Director of the Fourth Department is Wu Jiaxiang, the Director of the Fifth Department is Gan Naiguang, the Director of the Sixth Department is Wen Qun, or Chen Longxian, and the Director of the Seventh Department is concurrently held by Yang Yongtai. The above departments are directed by the Chief of Staff and Secretary-General. In addition, there are four departments under the control of the Expeditionary Headquarters, such as He Zhonghan, Director of the Political Training Department, and Lin Xiang, Director of the Transportation Department, who are both incumbents. In addition, the Chairman's Adjutant's Office has one or two departments. The Director of the First Department is Yan Daogang, and the Director of the Second Department is Chen Bulei. It is rumored that there is also a Military Affairs Reorganization Department (the name seems to be undetermined). The position of Director will be assigned to Chen Cheng. They are not subordinate to the Expeditionary Headquarters. Whether there will be any further changes is unknown.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang expressed his appreciation to the Sichuan military generals for breaking up their defense zones and returning political power. He has telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government and various military generals to discuss the methods of taking over the garrison areas, transfer them as soon as possible, and report back. The original telegram is as follows: (Sichuan has been in turmoil for many years, and the military and the people are suffering. The special system of defense zones is not a good thing. The political function has lost its power to operate, and the social economy has fallen into collapse, causing the people to be blamed for feudalism and giving the enemy an excuse for disorganization. As a result, the Red bandits took the opportunity to use it as a haven for escape. Xu and Zhang have been entrenched on the north bank, and Zhu and Mao have repeatedly disturbed the southern border. Although it is fortunate that the various armies have fought bravely and encircled them, and there is hope of driving away the ugly, bandit suppression must use seven points of politics, which has become an unbreakable trend. Then the army is trying its best to suppress the bandits in a local area, while politics is universally creating bandits invisibly. The so-called fox buries and fox digs, its ridiculous contradiction, how can it be more than this. Now that the provincial government has been reorganized and established, and the generals of the various armies have successively declared to break up the defense zones and return political power, it can be seen that things must be reversed, and new opportunities have arisen, which is commendable. However, moving to good is valuable in doing, and eliminating abuses should be quick. It is hoped that the provincial government and the generals of the various armies will discuss the methods of taking over the garrison areas, transfer them as soon as possible, and report back without any hesitation. From now on, the provincial government is responsible for improving politics, and the generals are dedicated to reorganizing the army, gathering the achievements of unification, and gradually creating a healthy and prosperous governance. The revival of Sichuan is the foundation for the revival of the Chinese nation. The provincial government and the generals have heavy responsibilities, and they should all work hard.

<h3 id="e112">Jiangxi Province Gradually Lifts Blockade <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>—Salt Monopoly Taken Over by Cooperatives—</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Red bandits in the hinterland of Jiangxi can be said to be completely suppressed. In the border areas bordering neighboring provinces and the remote mountainous areas between counties, there are inevitably still scattered bandits hiding and resisting, waiting to be suppressed and pacified at the same time in order to eradicate them. However, at the beginning of the fifth encirclement and suppression, the policy of encirclement, blockade, blockhouses, and transportation was used to kill the bandits. Now that the bandits have been suppressed, the blockade should be lifted to allow goods to flow smoothly. The Expeditionary Headquarters has previously formulated a method of gradually advancing towards the bandit areas from the safe areas and lifting the blockade. That is, the blockade can be lifted in areas where the village cleaning and baojia have been completed and there are no traces of bandits within four borders, and the trade of grain, salt, kerosene, and cloth can be freely traded and restored to its original state. In the newly recovered areas where the remaining bandits have not yet been eliminated, the blockade will still be tightened, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs will set up a blockade section to manage the matter. The Security Department will manage and control the transportation permits for the daily necessities of the good people in the recovered areas. According to news from Fuzhou and Nanfeng, the blockade in that area has been gradually lifted. However, salt is the most important of the daily necessities of the common people. The authorities are sincerely afraid that the salt merchants will manipulate the market and hoard goods, and the common people will be exploited. Therefore, the salt monopoly is uniformly handed over to the already established cooperatives for transportation and sales to reduce the burden on the people in the bandit areas. However, the Nanchang Salt Guild, concerned with its business life, held a meeting and decided to send a letter to all counties and cities to strive for it unanimously. (February 23rd)</p>

<p>Anti-Smoking Committee Searches for Unauthorized Smokers</p>
<p>Wang Jiajun, leader of the investigation team of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee in the Songjiang area, recently learned that the atmosphere of smoking is very strong in Zhalin, Xintang and other places in this county. On the 24th, he specially joined ten police officers from Fengxian County and first went to the Cao Yiji smoking shop in Zhalin to inspect. It was found that the shop had a Class C license, but had ten opium pipes, and there were nine smokers inside, which was a violation of the regulations. He immediately asked the smokers to show their smoking cessation licenses. They all hesitated. Later, the owner took out a Class A smoking cessation license and twelve Class B smoking cessation licenses from the counter. As a result, after verification by Commissioner Wang, two of them matched the photos and were released immediately. The remaining seven have been sent to Songjiang yesterday, and the four smokers and twenty-one pieces of smoking paraphernalia seized from Xia Jianzhong's house in Xintang Town have also been sent to Songjiang for the Anti-Smoking Committee to handle. In addition, the investigators of the County Anti-Smoking Committee, Sun Zongxiang, and the police of the Second Substation searched the Qinji smoking shop in this city yesterday and found three unlicensed smokers, including Chen Xiannian, the home brewing tax collection director of the county's tobacco and alcohol tax office. He has also been transferred to the Anti-Smoking Committee for verification.</p>

<p>Zhu Jingbo, the former director of the Wuxian County Field Tax Collection Office, was accused of seven counts, including privately promoting tax collection, dereliction of duty and corruption, and embezzlement of people's arrears. The Finance Department dispatched Dong Binqian to Suzhou to investigate. Because it was found that Zhu did have corrupt behavior, Zhu was detained, dismissed, and was awaiting investigation. Later, at the end of the lunar year, Zhu was released on bail. Now the case has been investigated and completed. The Dong Committee, together with the Wuxian County magistrate, submitted the investigation process to the Finance Department in detail. According to provincial sources, Director Zhao believes that Zhu is suspected of corruption and will be transferred to the Wuxian County Local Court for investigation and handling in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Provincial Committee Arrives in Wuxi to Investigate the Anti-Smoking Policy</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee, in order to understand the implementation of the anti-smoking policy in various counties, specially dispatched instructor and investigator Mr. Qin Manyuan to investigate in various counties. After being commissioned, Mr. Qin first went to Wujin for inspection, and then went to Jiangyin for investigation. Now he came to Wuxi from Cheng. Yesterday, he went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Yan, and went to the County Anti-Smoking Association to inquire about the implementation of the anti-smoking policy and the current work outline. Finally, Secretary Yao led him to inspect the drug rehabilitation center and the investigation team, which was very thorough. The reporter visited Investigator Qin at his residence and asked about ways to promote smokers' self-surrender. He talked about two points: (1) Use the Baojia system to obtain joint guarantees from each household in each Baojia, guaranteeing that there are no smokers in each household in each Baojia; (2) Use school students to individually promote to each parent, and first persuade the parents of students who use drugs to quit. If it is not effective, then give various ridicules and humiliations. In this way, students with smoking parents will inevitably have to earnestly persuade their parents in this environment, and the parents will have to automatically quit after being moved by this. It seems that it is easier to achieve results by doing this, and it is not difficult to eliminate the scourge of opium.</p>
<p>Failure to Affix Stamp Duty Sent to Court for Handling</p>

Recently, Ju Da Nanhuo store in Badou Alley outside the North Gate sold a batch of goods to Xizhi Street, Changzhou. Its invoice was not affixed with the correct stamp duty, which was discovered by Changzhou and sent to the local branch court for handling.

<p>Suzhou Militia Member Commits Suicide by Poison in Changzhou</p>
<p>A traveler came to the Huashang Hotel in Juqian Street, Wuyi on the 24th. He was wearing a gray uniform and had no luggage. He opened room No. 8 and filled in the traveler's form with the name Chen Yihong, from Jiangyin, 28 years old. The room rate for that room was 40 cents per day. At that time, he prepaid one silver dollar. He went out on the afternoon of the 25th and did not return to the inn until after 12 o'clock at night. At that time, the tea house thought he had returned from watching a play and did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, at about 6 o'clock on the morning of the 26th, he suddenly heard a groan in the room. He called him, but he did not respond. He was shocked and immediately opened the door and reported to the first branch of the Public Security Bureau. He was immediately sent to Wujin Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's diagnosis, it was found that he had taken raw opium. Although he tried his best to rescue him, he died of poisoning too deeply and died at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. It was then discovered that the symbol worn by the traveler was a member of the first row of the first A of the second district of the Wuxian County Security Regiment. As for the reason for his suicide, he could not speak after taking the poison, and there was no suicide note, so there was no way to find out.</p>

<h3 id="e122">After the Auction of the Shenxin No. 7 Factory, the Authorities Negotiated with HSBC <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Huayin Consortium Decided to Appeal According to the Law</p>
<p>All Sectors of Industry and Commerce Unanimously Provided Assistance</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the auction of the Shenxin Textile Company's No. 7 Factory by the British HSBC Bank to a Japanese company for 2.25 million yuan the day before yesterday not only stirred up a huge shock among our government authorities, financial and industrial circles, but also received unanimous support from the media. Therefore, the general public has been closely watching the development of this event. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter made a special trip to inquire about everything from all parties involved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Authorities Negotiated with HSBC. At 3:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, when the factory was being auctioned, President Wang sent an urgent telegram to Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, to advise HSBC Bank to stop the auction. Although it was too late, Mayor Wu still sent Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to HSBC Bank to persuade them. Due to the lateness of the hour, a detailed discussion could not be held. At 10:30 a.m. yesterday, Yu visited Mr. Hechman (A.S. Hechman), the chief manager of the bank. It is said that his attitude was still good, and he only said that the auction had already taken place. If the Chinese side has any solutions, they can discuss them further.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Responded by Telegram, Applying the Civil Code. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Local Association have received and understood the telegram. Since the debtor is Chinese, the procedures of Article 873 of the Civil Code should apply. The association etc. can directly request the Shanghai Municipal Government to negotiate. (Signed) Ministry of Industry. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, Article 873 of the Civil Code, mentioned in the telegram, reads as follows: If the mortgagee has not been repaid after the debt has reached the due date for repayment, he may petition the court to auction the mortgaged property and receive repayment from the proceeds of the sale. An agreement that the ownership of the mortgaged property shall be transferred to the mortgagee when the debt has reached the due date for repayment and has not been repaid is invalid.</p>
<p>The Huayin Consortium Decided to Appeal. According to the Central News Agency, in addition to HSBC Bank, Shenxin No. 7 Factory also borrowed from a consortium of Chinese banks, including China Bank, Shanghai Bank, and other Huichang banks. This time, HSBC Bank resolutely and independently carried out the auction of the factory. The consortium jointly appointed representatives from China Bank and Shanghai Bank to submit an application to the First Special District Court for a preliminary attachment order. Now that HSBC Bank has resolutely carried out the auction, it is actually illegal. Therefore, China Bank and Shanghai Bank have decided to file an appeal, and the court will also handle the matter in accordance with the law to seek fairness. Furthermore, Lawyer Guo Shouyi of Shenxin Textile Company also issued an urgent notice yesterday morning, denying that the auction had obtained legal ownership.</p>
<p>The Composition of the Second Creditor Group. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter visited the person in charge of the China Bank representative of the second creditor. According to him, this consortium was established in June 1934, consisting of China Bank, Shanghai Bank, and thirteen Huichang banks, including Zhixiang, Qingcheng, Henglong, Qingda, Rongkang, Henglai, Zifeng, Dingkang, Heping, Huicheng, Futai, Baofeng, and Xinkang. At that time, the financial community was determined to use its strength to assist our critically endangered industrial sector. Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, in order to maintain various industries, mortgaged several yarn factories and other properties worth more than 10 million yuan to the consortium for a loan of 2.8 million yuan (of which the Huichang banks accounted for 320,000 yuan). Among the above-mentioned mortgaged properties, Shenxin No. 7 Factory was also one of them. At that time, HSBC Bank also acknowledged that this consortium was the second creditor. Now, it has suddenly changed its attitude, only considering its own interests and disregarding the law and human sentiment, and handed it over to the auction house for auction at a very low bid price. It is deeply regrettable. At present, lawyers from both sides are responsible for exchanging opinions to seek a solution. If it is still impossible to resolve, we can only seek legal protection, and people from all walks of life in our country will surely rise up to support us.</p>
<p>The Factory Association Held a Meeting and Sent Telegrams of Appeal. According to the Guowen News Agency, the China Cotton Mill Owners Association held an extraordinary executive committee meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday because HSBC Bank illegally auctioned the Shanghai Shenxin No. 7 Factory. Fifteen committee members attended, chaired by Guo Shun. The following resolutions were made: (1) To organize a sub-committee to study the measures, and immediately appoint Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, and Liu Mengjing as members. (2) To send telegrams to Chairman Jiang in Wuchang, the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting them to take immediate measures to save the situation. (Remainder omitted.) The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. Yesterday, the association sent telegrams to the government authorities based on the motion, saying: Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Commander-in-Chief Jiang of the Wuchang Headquarters, and Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, respectfully reviewed. The Shanghai Shenxin No. 7 Factory was illegally auctioned by the British HSBC Bank on the 26th of this month, disregarding the preliminary attachment ruling of the Shanghai Special District Local Court, which is detrimental to the dignity of the country and concerns the future of the national cotton textile industry. The impact is enormous. It is also heard that foreign businessmen intend to take over the factory's property, which may lead to serious problems. We are panicking and earnestly request you to quickly take measures to stop it, so as to protect national rights and maintain industry. Respectfully, China Cotton Mill Owners Association, Qin.</p>
<p>The Financial Community Expressed Deep Regret. A Central News Agency reporter also interviewed a prominent figure in the financial community. According to him, HSBC Bank's audacious auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory is a concrete manifestation of capitalist countries destroying national industry. What is most regrettable is that it disregards the feelings of colleagues and the commercial customs and social and economic conditions of the location of the bank. Last year, HSBC was once in a difficult situation. Although Chinese banks have long been oppressed by foreign banks, in order to coexist and prosper with colleagues, the Four Banks Joint Savings Society and China Bank jointly provided a huge sum of 5 million yuan. Kicking someone when they are down is something that our national morality despises. Moreover, there is more than one Chinese industry mortgaged to foreign banks. If this trend continues, those who are unable to repay on time due to special reasons will be handed over to the auction house for auction one by one, and there will be no such thing as commercial morality. If this matter is not rectified, then the Chinese people will inevitably be wary of foreign banks and change their original intentions. As for the fact that no Chinese competed during the auction, it has aroused astonishment among social人士. However, the preliminary attachment of Shenxin No. 7 Factory is well known, which is enough to show that Chinese businessmen respect the law. No one will regard this easily obtainable huge profit as worthless, because 2.25 million yuan is not an insignificant amount.</p>
<p>The Industrial Federation Sent an Urgent Telegram. According to the Shiye News Agency, the China General Chamber of Industry held an emergency meeting of all members at the Yiyou Society on Sanma Road at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss remedial measures. Twelve people attended, including Hu Xiyuan, Guo Shun, Wu Yunshu, Qian Chengxu, Cai Shengbai, and Wang Yaochen. Guo Shun chaired the meeting. It was unanimously resolved to oppose HSBC Bank's illegal auction and to send an urgent telegram to the government requesting prompt relief. The original telegram said: Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Judicial Administration, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Industry, respectfully reviewed. Shenxin No. 7 Factory was illegally auctioned by HSBC Bank, infringing on China's legal rights and destroying our national industry. (1) The mortgagee, China Bank and Shanghai Bank, has already requested the local court to implement preliminary attachment on the property, and has also notified the British Consulate for reference. However, HSBC ignored everything and disregarded China's legal rights. This is the most serious case. Regarding this matter, the government should come forward to negotiate with the position of the state, so as to make HSBC stop and hand over the property to the buyer, and HSBC should be responsible for its losses. (2) To take a step back, that is, to handle it in accordance with the legal procedures of various countries. The debtor should be notified 20 hours before the auction to allow them to make final preparations. Today, HSBC did not do this, and even according to the laws of that country, it should be subject to illegal punishment. We request the government to take urgent steps and ask the British Shanghai Court to immediately issue an injunction to stop HSBC from exercising its property rights. Respectfully, China General Chamber of Industry, Gan.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Met to Discuss Assistance Measures. According to the Dagong News Agency, the National Goods Factory Association held a reception for all sectors at the Atlantic Western Restaurant at 6 p.m. yesterday to discuss assistance measures. More than 60 representatives from more than 30 groups, including the China General Chamber of Industry, the Shanghai Citizens Advocating National Goods Association, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Union, and the China National Products Factory Association, including Qian Chengxu, Wu Zhihao, and Zhu Xuefan, attended. Chairman Zhang Zilian reported, roughly saying that since the Shenxin Textile Company's No. 7 Factory was illegally auctioned to a Japanese company by HSBC Bank at the lowest price of 2.25 million yuan, the government and all sectors of society have been arguing on the basis of reason. All the employees of the factory, with the mentality of "if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold," and the livelihoods of more than 10,000 employees, are about to fall into a desperate situation. At this time of social depression, imperialism is wantonly exerting its toxic flames of economic aggression and oppression, destroying industry, which is an unprecedented painful history for our country's industrial sector. Today, we are hosting representatives from all sectors to discuss assistance measures to maintain our country's industry.</p>
<p>Shenxin Representative Reported on the Process. Sun Zhencheng, a representative of Shenxin Factory, reported on the process, saying that Shenxin No. 7 Factory was reorganized from the Oriental Yarn Factory, which was purchased from British businessmen by Mr. Rong Zongjing and others in 1930. Since then, Mr. Rong has worked hard to plan, add spindles, improve materials, and spared no effort in construction, recovering rights and interests for the country and stabilizing the livelihoods of employees, which is well known to everyone. The value of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and machinery in the entire factory has reached more than 7 million yuan. In order to circulate national turnover, a loan of 2 million yuan was mortgaged to the British HSBC Bank. Interest payments totaling more than 1 million yuan have been paid over the years without interruption. Last year, the price of cotton was high and the price of yarn was low, and foreign goods were dumped fiercely. Affected by the economic depression, a loan of 2.8 million yuan was borrowed from China Bank and Shanghai Bank. Recently, a notice of催償 from HSBC Bank was received, and several negotiations were made, but they were rejected. Subsequently, funds were raised to redeem the factory and to pay all the interest. When consulting, the bank refused to accept the interest and, without legal procedures, entrusted Lussier and Moore Auction House to reduce the price of the factory's entire property to 2.25 million yuan and illegally auction it. Before the auction was held, the factory had entrusted Lawyer Guo Shouyi to publish an advertisement opposing the illegal auction. Another creditor of the factory, China Bank and Shanghai Bank, had already submitted an application to the Shanghai First Special District Court to execute a preliminary attachment on the factory's property. Without the approval of our court, no one may arbitrarily or in any way deal with the property. It was also heard that the court had sent personnel to the British Consulate to request that the auction be stopped. However, the bank still went its own way, using high-pressure tactics, and specially instructed Lussier and Moore Auction House to execute the illegal auction. The factory currently has more than 52,000 spindles, more than 8,000 thread spindles, and more than 440 looms. The value of the property, including land and buildings, is more than 5 million yuan. One day, it was illegally reduced in price and auctioned by the bank. Not only did the factory suffer unlimited damage, but also more than 4,000 employees in the entire factory are in danger of losing their jobs. Industry is the lifeline of people's livelihood, and justice is the prestige of the country. Looking at the bank's blatant disregard for the behavior, what is it like to destroy our country's industry? What is it like to undermine our country's justice? Its intention is obvious. Our factory is a member of the National Goods Factory Association. I am honored to report on the process at the request of Chairman Zhang. I hope you will give me your guidance. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Seven Resolutions Were Made to Provide Assistance. After the representatives present spoke one after another, the assistance measures were resolved as follows: (1) The associations present will jointly submit a petition to the government, requesting the government to seriously negotiate with the British Consul regarding HSBC Bank's illegal auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory. (2) Jointly send a letter to HSBC Bank to warn it to abide by the laws of the country where it is located. (3) Jointly send a letter to the banking and money industries to assist Shenxin and provide economic support at the end of the negotiations. (4) Elect Qian Chengxu, Zhu Xuefan, Lu Xingzhuang, Zhu Wenqi, Zhang Zilian, Wang Jiean, and Chen Binghui to petition the municipal government. (5) Telegraph the government to allocate 2.25 million yuan from the unified cotton tax to repay HSBC. If the goal cannot be achieved, the deduction will be made by each factory. (6) Appoint Tao Leqin, Ren Jinpin, Li Cishan, Qin Daishi, and Cao Zhigong to draft the telegram. (7) A meeting will be held tomorrow (today) at 10 a.m. at the Factory Association on Sanma Road to discuss the implementation measures.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of National Manufacturers. The Shanghai China National Products Manufacturers Association, in view of the fact that the British HSBC Bank blatantly auctioned Shenxin Yarn Factory's No. 7 Factory regardless of everything, convened a temporary emergency meeting at 9 a.m. yesterday. More than ten committee members attended, including Wang Hanqiang, Liu Zhongying, Jin Weixuan, and Chen Binghui. Secretary Zhou Zhaolin and Chairman Liu Zhongying attended as observers. Xu Chengde took the minutes. They discussed how to assist and provide relief in the case of the British HSBC Bank's blatant auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory regardless of everything. The following resolutions were made: (1) To telegraph the central government, the Executive Yuan, and the ministries of industry, foreign affairs, and finance to provide as much relief and negotiation as possible. (2) To notify national manufacturers throughout the city to sever ties with foreign banks from now on (measures to be determined separately) and to send letters to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to instruct them to proceed accordingly. (3) To send personnel to慰問 Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Yarn Factory, and all colleagues of Shenxin No. 7 Factory. The National Products Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the national manufacturers in the city based on the resolutions of the emergency meeting, saying: Dear Sirs, according to yesterday's newspaper report, we were deeply saddened to read the news that Shenxin Yarn Factory's No. 7 Factory was illegally auctioned by the British HSBC Bank. We found that Shenxin Yarn Factory's No. 7 Factory, due to the lack of economic turnover, had previously mortgaged the entire property to the British HSBC Bank, which is an inevitable remedy in the midst of this widespread depression and the decline of industry and commerce. Now, the bank does not take the circulation of finance and serving the community as its responsibility, but uses the excuse that the factory cannot redeem the mortgage on time, and blatantly disregards everything, disposing of the factory's huge property worth 5 million yuan without the consent of the property owner, and unilaterally announces the auction. As a result, it was auctioned to a Japanese company for the lowest price of 2.25 million yuan. It can be seen that foreign banks rely on their imperialist economic aggression and blatantly destroy our country's industry. In addition to reporting to the central government and sending letters to all sectors to provide as much relief and negotiation as possible and make a strong resistance, we have also resolved to notify national goods manufacturers throughout the city to sever ties with foreign banks from now on. All national goods merchants must take the lead and earnestly implement this measure. We are sending this letter to you for your information and implementation. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Rong Expressed Extreme Pain. A Central News Agency reporter also met with Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Company, at his private residence. In addition to expressing his pain, Rong said that he was still determined to revitalize the industry he had worked so hard to build all his life with his inherent ambition. Rong also said that HSBC's blatant auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory was a deliberate attempt to destroy our country's industry. I am determined to resist to the end. I only hope that the government authorities and those who care about and love our country's industrial sector will jointly provide practical assistance and fair public opinion to avoid being wiped out by HSBC. Shenxin No. 7 Factory is still working as usual, pending the court's disposal.</p>
<p>A Letter Was Sent to the Bar Association for Discussion. Shenxin Textile Company sent a letter to the Shanghai Bar Association yesterday, saying: Dear Sirs, Shenxin No. 7 Factory of our company previously mortgaged its factory buildings, land, machinery, etc., worth more than 5 million yuan, to HSBC Bank for a loan of 2 million yuan. Later, due to the impact of the economic depression, the difficulties reached the extreme, resulting in the inability to repay the mortgage on time. We were in the process of trying to find ways to raise funds for repayment and疏通 接洽, but HSBC Bank disregarded everything and, without legal procedures, entrusted Lussier and Moore Auction House to auction it for 2.25 million yuan on the 26th of this month. Our country's textile industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. How can it withstand unexpected destruction? We have always admired your association for upholding justice and safeguarding industry. In addition to entrusting Lawyer Guo Shouyi to publish advertisements and oppose the auction, we are writing to your association to request you to promptly discuss it to provide remedies. We earnestly pray. Sincerely, Shenxin Textile Company, February 27th.</p>
<p>All Employees Issued a Declaration. The declaration of all employees of Shenxin No. 7 Factory says: The country is in danger, and foreign aggression is rampant. When the nest is overturned, no eggs remain intact. Our factory has been seven years since our General Manager Rong Zongjing purchased it from the British businessman Dongfang in 1928. It has a long history and an outstanding position. Employees have been working diligently day and night, hoping to win glory for our country's textile industry. However, in recent years, Japanese goods have been dumped in large quantities,奸商 have been doing evil for tigers, and the price of cotton has been high and the price of yarn has been low. The market is depressed, and Chinese businessmen are exhausted and hoarse. The government has not provided assistance, and the imperialists are moving at the opportunity, wanting to destroy our entire industry for a long time. Unfortunately, our factory is the first to bear the brunt. The British HSBC Bank mortgaged the property of our factory, which was originally an ordinary commercial transaction. Interest has been paid on time without interruption. Recently, we were preparing to raise funds to redeem the factory and were willing to pay all the interest, but the bank blatantly disregarded it and entrusted Lussier and Moore Auction House to reduce the price of the factory's property, which is worth more than 5 million yuan, to 2.25 million yuan and arbitrarily and illegally</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Auctioned it. Upon investigation, our factory also has other creditors, China Bank and Shanghai Bank, which had already applied to the Shanghai First Special District Court to execute a preliminary attachment the day before. Without the permission of our court, no one can sell it arbitrarily. However, the bank used high-pressure tactics to execute the auction, and its deliberate attempt to destroy our country's industry and undermine our country's justice is obvious. This is intolerable. Employees' lives are at stake, and their interests are closely related. Regarding the British merchants' illegal auction, the public is angry and unanimously resolved that before the bank complies with our country's laws and cancels the illegal auction, employees will resolutely oppose it with their last breath. We humbly hope that the government officials will negotiate promptly and that the public groups will quickly rise up to provide assistance to protect our country's industry and maintain the livelihoods of our more than 3,000 employees. We are writing this letter with grief and anger. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Payment Will Be Made Within a Week to Take Over. HSBC Bank stipulated that the buyer must pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan immediately after the auction. The entire price must be paid in full within one week, otherwise the deposit will be forfeited. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the Japanese merchants purchased the factory this time at the initiative of the Japanese Textile Association in China, and a syndicate jointly organized by four Japanese yarn factories, including Toyota, Gonda, and Nihua, purchased it. It is said that the syndicate has prepared to raise 2.25 million yuan and pay it within the time limit. Once the price is paid in full, the takeover will be implemented. However, it is expected that disputes and legal issues will inevitably arise at that time.</p>
<p>The Winner of the Auction as Reported by the Japanese Newspaper. Yesterday, the Japanese Daily News reported that the auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory, China's largest national industry, has caused a major shock in society. At 3:30 p.m. on the 26th, it was finally auctioned at Lussier and Moore Auction House. As a result, it fell into the hands of a Japanese national for 2.25 million yuan. At that time, Lawyer Murakami, who came forward to bid, strictly kept secret the principal and method of use. However, on the Japanese side, it is said that the South Manchuria Railway Company will use it to rebuild the wharf, and that it was purchased by Mitsui Capital, but the parties concerned have not admitted it. However, it is always in the hands of the South Manchuria Railway, Japanese yarn factories, and Mitsui. The factory is equipped with 59,484 spindles, 440 looms, and 3,200 workers. The fact that it was auctioned proves the decline of China's national industrial yarn factories. According to the Daily News, Shenxin No. 7 Factory, which was auctioned yesterday, was purchased by Lawyer Okamoto Otsuichi, who was commissioned by a certain company. It is rumored that Gonda Yarn Factory purchased it, but Gonda denied it. When asked Lawyer Okamoto, he said, "Since it is not mine, it is probably not from the yarn factory."</p>

<p>Instructed All Banks to Make Every Effort to Extend Loans</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Local Association, in order to rescue the market, jointly elected Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Zuoting, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Gongquan, and Qin Runqing to meet with Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance to submit a petition requesting the Central Bank to extend as many loans as possible to industry and commerce. Minister Kong had already agreed to handle it in person. According to a report from Beijing, the Ministry of Finance has now replied to the two groups, saying that it has received the petition stating that Shanghai's commercial market is depressed and all industries are requesting relief, and requesting that the Central Bank, etc., extend as many mortgages as possible to industry and commerce for those who use considerable goods or real estate as collateral and have reliable guarantees. The Ministry has learned that the situation in Shanghai is in need of rescue. In recent months, the Ministry has repeatedly requested the Central Bank to jointly release huge sums of money with the Bank of Communications to maintain the market, so that the old and new years can be safely spent. All of these facts are well known to people from all walks of life. In view of the previous situation, in addition to separately instructing all banks to do their best to provide reliable collateral for various industries when requesting loans in accordance with the law, in order to maintain the market, it is hoped that all industries can develop vigorously. This batch should be known and observed. This batch.</p>

<p>Only 60% of the Listed Price Is Charged</p>
<p>Since its launch, the newly built China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Si Hai vessel has been popular with passengers traveling to various ports in South China because of its beautiful layout, attentive service, and excellent security equipment. The price of first-class tickets from Shanghai to Shantou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou was originally set at 75 yuan from Shanghai to Xiamen, 80 yuan to Shantou, 85 yuan to Hong Kong, and 95 yuan to Guangzhou. In order to give preferential treatment to passengers and reduce the burden on Chinese passengers taking the Si Hai vessel, the first-class ticket prices have been sharply reduced, so that passengers can travel at the most affordable fare and take the best seats. Shanghai to Xiamen is now reduced to 42 yuan (33 yuan less than the original price), to Shantou is reduced to 45 yuan (35 yuan less), to Hong Kong is reduced to 50 yuan (35 yuan less), and to Guangdong is reduced to 54 yuan (41 yuan less). It is cheaper than any foreign vessel on the same route. The service of the attendants is especially attentive. They do not ask passengers for any tips, which is a unique feature of the shipping industry. It is heard that in the Haili vessel, several passengers strongly gave rewards, but the attendants firmly refused to accept them. After going back and forth seven times, the passengers became angry and, as a result, deposited the money in the accounting room, and the attendants never received a penny. Currently, the company stipulates that there will be a ship leaving Shanghai for Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou every Wednesday and Saturday, and a ship leaving Shanghai for Qingdao every Saturday. The first-class room from Shanghai to Qingdao is only 40 yuan.</p>

<p>The company has decided to provide generous compensation according to regulations</p>
<p>The crashed aircraft has been repaired and flown to Hankou</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 3 aircraft, flying the Guangzhou (Canton) line, crashed in Yichang County, on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, on the 21st due to fog. The German pilot, Cullenberg, suffered a leg injury. The company dispatched No. 8 aircraft to transport him to Hankou for hospital treatment. At the time, the Shanghai head office was informed that Mr. Cullenberg's leg injury was not serious. Nevertheless, the company prepared to send Dr. Nol, a German doctor, to Hankou on the company's large aircraft yesterday morning for a medical examination. However, just as the aircraft was about to depart from Shanghai, the company suddenly received a telegram from Hankou reporting that Mr. Cullenberg's condition had suddenly deteriorated and he had died at 9:00 AM yesterday. The company then notified Dr. Nol to cancel his flight to Hankou. According to the company's spokesperson, speaking to a Sin Sin News Agency reporter, regarding the handling of Mr. Cullenberg's funeral arrangements, the company will act in accordance with the driver's contract and provide generous compensation according to regulations. Mr. Cullenberg's family, including his wife and two daughters, originally resided in Hankou. Mr. Cullenberg himself had taken out life insurance with the German Royal Insurance Company. As for the crashed No. 3 aircraft, it has been repaired by engineers from the company's Changsha office who rushed to the accident site. Because the damage was minimal, it was repaired a few days ago and flown to Hankou yesterday afternoon. Since the flight power was not damaged, it will resume flying the Guangzhou line.</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce has notified all its members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Recruiting Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association, in order to awaken the attention of all citizens and encourage them to join the China Aviation Association as members and to save food and clothing and enthusiastically donate to the National Aviation Salvation Fund, has specially requested all newspapers in the city to publish slogans for the National Aviation Salvation Recruitment Movement daily. The discovered slogans are as follows: (1) Save the country through aviation, (2) To consolidate the Republic of China, we must build aviation, (3) Without building aviation, there is no way to pacify the country and resist foreign aggression, (4) Without building aviation, we cannot resolve the national crisis, (5) Aviation is the defender of the nation, (6) Aviation is the vanguard of national defense, (7) Expand the movement to save the country through aviation, (8) Support the government to expand the air force, (9) Strive to build air defense, (10) Strive to develop civil aviation.</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the General Team previously sent a letter to various organizations, notifying their members to work hard to save the country through aviation and to unanimously join the China Aviation Association as members. Yesterday, a reply was received from the City Chamber of Commerce stating that it had notified all its members to comply. The original letter is as follows: Directly reply to the letter received on the 26th of this month, requesting that members be notified to work hard for the National Aviation Salvation Movement and to unanimously join the China Aviation Association as members, etc. Having investigated the matter, we first received a letter from the City Party Department, forwarding the various items mentioned in your letter, and ordered the meeting. On the 23rd of this month, we notified all members of this association to investigate and act accordingly. We are sending this letter in response for your information.</p>
<p>Team Leader Yan Zhenyu of Team 289, who is the principal of Wuben Girls' Middle School, immediately convened a discussion with all the school's faculty and staff after receiving the letter of appointment from the general team leader. In addition to all faculty and staff joining as members and soliciting donations for national aviation salvation from outside, some of the middle school students of the school have already joined as members. The rest are required to donate 50 cents each. Separate measures will be determined for elementary school students. Team Leader Chen Hongbi of Team 350 is the principal of Guangdong Middle School. After receiving the recruitment documents, he immediately convened a meeting of faculty, staff, and student representatives and resolved that everyone would join as members. Furthermore, Team Leader Li Mulian of Team 141 reported that recruitment work had begun, and the matter was raised for discussion at the standing meeting of the Transportation Trade Association on the 23rd of this month. All executives and supervisors were members and expanded the recruitment of members and solicited donations for national aviation salvation from outside. It can be seen that the team leaders of each recruitment team are generally enthusiastic in promoting the recruitment movement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, letters from Team Leader Wang Peisun of Team 316, Team Leader Sun Zhenchun of Team 377, and Team Leader Zhu Jingan of Team 170 stated that after receiving the letter of appointment and other documents, they were actively carrying out recruitment work. The various recruitment documents previously issued were insufficient, and they requested that they be reissued for application. It is reported that the office has separately reissued hundreds of copies of membership applications, badges, and overviews of the recruitment movement. This proves that all circles are enthusiastically participating in national aviation salvation. Furthermore, Team Leader Yang Meinan of Team 202 has been working very hard since starting the recruitment work. It is reported that the team has additionally hired 20 deputy team leaders to expand the recruitment of members. Yesterday, they also sent a letter to the general team leader's office requesting that the second batch of recruitment movement overviews, membership applications, and badges be reissued in thousands of copies.

<h3 id="e127">Guantai Blocking and Closing Project <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Kong Xiangrong Telegraphed Hu Yuanhui</p>
<p>Attention to Preparation and Planning Matters</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, member of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee and Director of the Labor Relief Group, recently went to the construction site to inspect the water situation and construction conditions, as well as the river bureau's collection of materials and the progress of the blocking work. Detailed guidance plans were given regarding the various matters to be noted during the blocking, and they have been handed over to Hu Yuanhui, Director of the Construction Department of Hebei Province, to forward to the river bureau for compliance and strict supervision to accelerate progress. The original telegram and attached list of matters to be noted are recorded below:</p>
<p>Strict Telegram Urging: The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee's Labor Relief Group telegraphed Guantai, Hu Yuanhui, Director of the Construction Department of Hebei Province: (Omissions) Investigating the Guantai blocking project, the relationship is important. Since this group was ordered to supervise the progress of the Yellow River River Bureau in the province, telegrams have been repeatedly sent urging the rush to estimate the budget. From last autumn until the beginning of winter, reports were delayed. Considering that the weather was getting cold at that time, and fearing that the freezing ground would affect the work, I had no choice but to telegraph the bureau on November 5 of last year, setting a deadline of three days to estimate and send detailed estimates of each mouth and blocking. At the same time, I personally went to the construction site to inspect and wait, and the estimate was finally submitted after investigation. I then contracted with the Yellow Benefit Association to approve and order compliance, and immediately began to supervise the bureau to purchase materials, rush to hire box boats, transport iron anchors, recruit workers, and also dispatched personnel to the construction site to assist in case of emergency, and allocated funds from time to time to provide a steady stream of supplies. On November 17 of last year, I telegraphed the bureau, setting a deadline of one month to complete the blocking, and on the 20th of the same month, I set a deadline of two weeks to transport all materials for preparation, so as to avoid temporary panic, suspension of work while waiting for materials, and delaying important work. Telegrams were exchanged frequently, without a day of rest. The original plan was to rush to block and close the gap before the winter solstice (December 22) according to the original planned steps. The bureau also replied on December 13, stating that it had strictly urged efforts to work and block in time, so as not to delay the work. Unexpectedly, as of December 18, although 781 meters of the mouth had been occupied, only 64 meters remained. At that time, the water was calm, which was a good time to rush to block, but because the jute ordered by the bureau's supervisor, He Du Xiu, was far away in Jining and could not be obtained, the great opportunity to block and lower the water level before the winter solstice was lost. After that, either the straw was missing, or the jute was missing, and the straw and jute could not be delivered to the work site in large quantities at the same time. Day after day, the water level gradually rose, and the mouth became deeper and deeper. The work situation deteriorated, and the original estimated materials were used up for emergency protection, resulting in insufficient application of the original work funds. In this extremely difficult situation, Rong discussed relief measures at the work site and submitted a request to this association to allocate relief from the remaining funds of the Fenglou blocking project last year, and also added 3 million catties of straw, 50,000 catties of jute, and 30,000 green bricks, and increased personnel to assist in hiring boats for transportation and intensify work to make up for the situation in many ways, setting a deadline of two weeks to be responsible for blocking and closing the gap. The bureau also stated in the case of applying for additional external engineering fees on December 24 that the various materials should be the responsibility of the bureau to actively purchase and transport, purchasing all of them within 12 days, and aiming to close the gap within 14 days. According to the original presentation, the materials should be transported by January 5 of this year, and the blocking should begin on the 7th. Considering the urgency of closing the gap and the importance of materials, which must be fully prepared to meet the emergency needs and provide resources for rushing to block, this group strictly telegraphed to urge on December 28 of last year, and on the 29th, ordered the concentration of employees to rush to build side dams. However, on January 3 of this year, the resident inspectors of this group reported that the bureau's straw, green bricks, jute, etc. were all insufficient. After strict urging, they still failed to transport all the materials on time, and the river water was falling on the 7th. The water depth in front of the east and west dams was only a little over 8 meters. If the blocking could have been carried out as scheduled, it would have been closed long ago. Those who urged kept urging, and those who delayed kept delaying, and this best opportunity was missed again. It is extremely regrettable to say. By the 17th of the same month, the entire river was flowing with ice, and the continued supply of materials was stopped again. It was found that on February 3 of this year, the water level had become stable, and the water depth of the two dams was only over 8 meters. However, due to the bureau's repeated inconsistencies between words and deeds, and the delay in transporting materials, the blocking could not be carried out. As of the end of last year of the abolished calendar, three good opportunities for blocking and closing the gap had been lost. On February 5 of this year, this group, together with the Yellow Benefit Association and your Director, discussed the method of blocking and closing the gap. Jute bags, green bricks, lead wire box boats, iron anchors, etc., were all limited to being prepared and delivered to the work site by the evening of the 11th of this month, and construction would begin on the 11th, occupation would begin on the 15th, and closure would be achieved on the 23rd and 24th. Now that only a few days remain, the bureau's straw and other items are again overdue. According to reports, today's water situation is turning better to the south. The 2 million catties of straw and 100,000 green bricks prepared by this group have arrived at the work site one after another. The 300 cubic meters of stone have also been purchased and transported from Gongyi. 50,000 jute bags have been ordered in Shanghai according to instructions and negotiated to use the original vehicles for direct transportation, without changing vehicles along the way. The joint transportation method will be fully delivered to the work site within days. Fearing that the urgent use is too urgent, we have also negotiated with the Henan River Bureau to borrow 10,000 jute bags. Tomorrow, after the formalities of the Henan Provincial Government's approval and handover to the River Bureau, they can be transported. We also plan to negotiate with the Henan River Bureau to borrow 100 to 200 cubic meters of stone for emergency needs. In addition to those who have been dispatched, more personnel will be added to the two dams to supervise and assist in the work. In addition, as discussed in person at the work site yesterday, the Director will send personnel to Hankou to purchase and transport 50,000 jute bags, and Shi Yun Gong will provide emergency supplies. I don't know if they have been purchased and shipped on time. I hope they will be delivered on time to avoid delays. As for the additional yellow materials, reed mats, cattail bags, wooden stakes, jute, etc. requested by the River Bureau, the amount of money needed is not much, and the River Bureau should immediately handle them according to the amount received. The various materials requested by the River Bureau have been planned and collected in advance. As for the item of earth resistance and earth filling, not only funds are needed for handling, but also preparations should be made in advance in detail. Please allocate funds nearby and guide the progress immediately. If orderly and systematic steps can be taken, and the blocking can be carried out according to the established plan, it will not be difficult to complete it in one breath. The various items that should be noted during the blocking are listed separately below. Please forward them to the River Bureau for information, so as to be comprehensive, so that we can see the success early and rejoice together. Special telegram for inspection, and I hope you will strictly supervise it. Rong has prepared the urgently needed materials and will return to the work site tomorrow. I know and hear together.</p>
<p>Instruction Plan: Matters to be noted in the preparation and planning of the Guantai Blocking and Closing Project: (1) It is found that the Guantai project has repeatedly failed to carry out blocking as scheduled due to the lack of materials in the River Bureau. Now that the materials have been prepared, the progress of blocking and closing the gap must be properly planned and handled in advance to avoid temporary panic. The first question to be determined now is whether to rush to build the counter cabinet first and then occupy, or to occupy first and then rush to build the counter cabinet. If the counter cabinet is rushed first, the back river of the two dams will be scoured, which will definitely not be able to catch up in a short time. It is deeply felt that the occupation will be difficult and slow. Moreover, the current value of water falling is a pity to lose the opportunity. If the occupation is advanced and the counter cabinet is rushed later, the isolated occupation will be tightened and the scouring will be deepened, which is even more dangerous. Although the back filling cabinet after connecting to the old occupation is relatively easy to handle, it is still not easy to advance with the new advance occupation and the back filling cabinet, because the mouth is narrow, the water flow is more rapid, and the swirling flow is still inevitable. Which one should be first and which one should be later should be considered early. (2) The most important thing when closing the gap is earthwork. The east dam is 1,500 feet long, and the west dam is also 1,000 feet long. There is no soil to be taken from the earth fields on both sides. It is estimated that when closing the gap, the soil in the middle earth cabinet is temporarily calculated as 10 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 50 feet high, which requires about 750 cubic feet. The east dam soil truck travels three miles back and forth, and the west dam soil truck is no less than two miles. According to the previous soil pushing achievements, it is estimated that each truck can extract 2 points of soil per day. How many trucks are needed each day for each dam to be sufficient? Moreover, the dam surface is not wide, how many soil trucks can it accommodate, and the distribution of truck roads are all important issues. If there are 300 soil trucks per dam per day, a total of 120 cubic feet of dam work can be done per day (losses are not yet counted). It takes 6-7 days to fill the earth cabinet. Can Jinmen's occupation be relied on for a long time? This is a very big problem and should be paid special attention to. Moreover, the earth filling behind the side dam is not easy to handle. In this situation, whether it is to rush to build the cabinet and then occupy, or to advance the occupation and rush to build the counter cabinet, the soil truck cannot rush urgently, and it is necessary to quickly purchase a large amount of jute bags to hold soil instead of rushing to handle it temporarily. As for the soil in the earth cabinet, calculated at 70 bags per cubic foot, about 50,000 bags are needed. If cloth bags are used instead, it is feared that three times as many will be needed, even small jute bags must be doubled. This kind of jute bag must be made early, stored near the doorway for backup supply, which is extremely important and cannot be slightly ignored. It is more necessary to delineate the truck road to avoid soil accumulation and crowding, or to store more earth oxen for temporary use, because the earth cabinet is not all made of jute bag soil. As for the place where the earth is pushed after the side dam of the mouth, because the scouring is too deep, it is not easy to fill and help with soil. It is necessary to rush to fill with bag soil. The number of this item of jute bags is not small, and it must be carefully calculated in advance. The truck route, the issuing and receiving of soil tickets, the exchange of cash, and the preparation of soil trucks, and the allocation of supervisory officers and yamen runners should all be considered in advance and properly planned and distributed. The difficulty of advancing the earth filing after all the earth cabinets are advanced before and after the closing is as described above, but only before the earth cabinet has not been filled under Jinmen's occupation, the river bottom is thinly silted, and it is feared that the undercurrent will attack the positive dam foot sweep. It is necessary to take emergency protection and slowly advance the earth resistance to avoid mistakes. The material for protection is to first throw jute bags, and then use crude stones, or use lead jute cages to cage stones and throw them into a slope, one is to avoid the danger of large flows on the top, and the other is to protect the broom feet from scouring again. Especially for the throwing protection of crude stones, it must be extra careful to avoid the flow into the mouth and hinder the occupation. This item of jute bags does not expect how much each is needed, and must be purchased in advance, transported in unity, and properly packed for use. This layer is extremely important and cannot be ignored. It should also be planned and handled properly at the same time. (4) It is found that the east dam is 1,500 feet long, and the early occupation made is more than two-thirds. The broom height water surface is only 2 meters low, and the dam width is wider than the deep water occupation, and the rest are 2 to 2.5 feet. The occupation body is short and weak, and the back earthwork is also weak. After the mouth is closed, the water level rises, or the big river water rises, and the flow directly tends to the east dam. The newly silted sand is inevitable to seep and brush the broom, and should be carefully investigated to prevent potential pitfalls. It is appropriate to throw protection for the welcoming flow top punch with jute bag crude stone brick cages. The bay protruding place is suitable for the flow rushing out of the sand beach on the west bank. More crude stones should be thrown to prevent the flow from leaning against the broom and avoid scouring. And investigate other places where the slip shoots, and throw protection in advance in this way, which is more stable. Where the dam body is low and thin, the soil should also be appropriately increased to increase the pressure and reduce seepage and brushing. The amount of jute bag crude stone needed should be calculated early. At this time, special attention should be paid to the broom that the east dam advances and borders, and its river bottom. The broom eyes should be free of seepage, and the west dam's broom should be carefully repaired when it has been subsided repeatedly, without perfunctory. Before closing the gap, increase the throwing of protective feet bricks, stones, and jute bags to prevent seepage. (5) According to recent reports from resident inspectors, the river flows south, and the sand beach is exposed in front of the mouth near the river. The river water is falling, and the water is shallow where the river mouth branches, and the flow is not wide. If willows can be dropped to form a dam or sign piles can be sunk to reduce the mouth flow, personnel should be sent to investigate the terrain and river situation and handle it carefully. This layer is very important and should be paid special attention to. (6) It is only a little over a month away from Taofan. After the Guantai closing, it seems that it will not be possible to complete the closing of mouths such as Jiugu Road in a very short time. The Zizhen that connects the east and west dams of Guantai is about 2 meters high from the current water surface. The trench site is low and the trench body is thin. Can it resist water? In addition, the various string ditches blocked below Guantai must be increased at the same time, or choose to do protective eaves broom to avoid digging wells when thirsty and delaying the completed work. This should also be paid special attention to. In addition, it is especially important to assign working personnel in advance to their respective duties, and it is more necessary to unite in spirit and work hard to serve, with the determination to block the gap, forge ahead bravely, be of one mind and cooperate, divide the work and cooperate, and achieve success. This is also in the guidance of the chief officer in charge, and colleagues do their best to be responsible. Then the great success will be achieved in no time, and the lives and property of millions of people will be relied upon. Rong is not talented, and is willing to follow in the footsteps of the gentlemen to encourage people to encourage themselves. Attached by Kong Xiangrong, Director of the Labor Relief Group.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Major Traffic Accidents Should Be Reported to the Ministry According to Regulations <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Lianglu Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways, stating: Regarding matters such as route obstructions, bridge damage, and train collisions occurring on various lines, the station where the incident occurred should telegraph the responsible bureau and simultaneously telegraph the Transportation Department of the Ministry. Furthermore, the Railway Bureau should telegraph the Ministry with detailed information within 24 hours. This was already communicated to all lines in the tenth month of the twentieth year to be followed. However, recently, after major accidents occurred on various lines, the stations involved often failed to notify the Transportation Department of the Ministry according to the regulations. This has resulted in the Ministry often being unable to promptly understand the true situation regarding major traffic accidents on various lines. Sometimes, newspapers in various locations have already published the information, while the Ministry has not yet received a detailed report. This situation is highly inappropriate. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated. In the future, if any major traffic accidents occur, the regulations established in the tenth month of the twentieth year must be strictly followed and must not be deliberately violated. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued for the bureau to follow. This bureau has already instructed the Engineering, Transportation, and Mechanical Departments, as well as the Police Department, to comply.</p>

<p>Team Leader Sworn into Office</p>
<p>Hongqiao Town in the Pu Song District of West Shanghai is strategically located, bordering Zhongshan Avenue to the east, Songjiang and Qingpu counties to the west, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to the south, and Hongqiao Road to the north. The Puhuitang River runs through it, making water and land transportation convenient and commerce prosperous. The gentry and merchants of the town, recognizing the importance of public safety, applied to the Shanghai Municipal Security Committee last year to form a team, which was approved. Qian Baolin was appointed as the team leader. February 10th was the day for the team's establishment and the team leader's swearing-in ceremony. Those present included Zhong Huan, leader of the staff group of the Shanghai Municipal Security Committee, Wang Tongfu, head of the Pu Song District Corps, Hou Junren, representative of the Tenth District Party Department of Shanghai, corps directors Pan Liangshi, Gu Rungui, Chen Xuewen, Ding Shanming, Gu Youchun, and hundreds of guests and team members.

<h3 id="e133">Ren Zuojun Returns to Shanghai After Investigating Life Insurance <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The American Asiatic Life Insurance Company sent Mr. Ren Zuojun abroad in June last year to investigate the life insurance business. Mr. Ren has now returned to Shanghai. According to him, after going abroad, he engaged in research at the Maryland Life Insurance Company and the United Insurance Company in Baltimore, USA. Later, he conducted on-site research at the two largest insurance companies in New York. Each of these two insurance companies employs 12,000 clerks and 50,000 managers, making their scale unparalleled in the world. His research on life insurance focused on weekly savings and longevity insurance, and he gained a lot of insights. In addition to studying life insurance, he also investigated the conditions of various factories in the eastern United States, such as gasoline refineries, steel mills, sugar factories, bicycle manufacturing plants, fertilizer factories, and aircraft manufacturing plants, all of which he visited. He was particularly amazed by the grandeur of the Chicago World's Fair. After leaving the United States, he traveled through Europe, exited the Suez Canal, and returned to China via India. He paid attention to the industrial and commercial conditions of the countries he passed through, as well as the various political and economic facilities related to the welfare of the people. Furthermore, Mr. Ren traveled around the world and purchased meaningful landscape photos and several industrial samples for future exhibitions. However, he is currently too busy to sort them out. Once they are sorted out, they will be made public. Anyone who is interested in foreign industrial and commercial enterprises and wants to discuss with Mr. Ren to gain practical benefits can write directly to Mr. Ren (address: American Asiatic Life Insurance Company, Bund, Shanghai) to arrange a meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e137">The Crew of the Jiahe Ship Were Ransomed Three Times Unsuccessfully <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Ask for Ransom Payments in Different Tiers</p>
<p>Family Members Decide to Take Joint Action</p>
<p>Since the Jiahe ship of the China Merchants Bureau was robbed by pirates, the ship has been out of service. The pirate leader arranged for representatives of the families of the three kidnapped crew members to negotiate, but two attempts failed. Now, the third attempt has also broken down. The families of the three hostages have decided not to pay the ransom and let things take their course. The latest follow-up reports are as follows:</p>
<p>Contacted Three Times　During the second time that the representatives sent by the three crew members arrived in port to negotiate with the bandits, the bandits suddenly demanded a ransom of 60,000 yuan, making it impossible to pay, and the negotiations ended. At the beginning of last month, the bandits suddenly claimed that they were willing to automatically reduce the ransom for the three men and ordered the families to send representatives to the port again. The three families jointly appointed a Mr. Zhong as their representative to go to the port for the third negotiation to redeem the hostages. When Mr. Zhong arrived in port, he was hoping to redeem the three men, but to his surprise, another change occurred.</p>
<p>Bandits Ask for Different Prices　During the third negotiation with the bandits, the ransom prices for the three men were indeed reduced compared to the previous time, but the bandits changed the ransom prices for the three crew members to be different based on importance and seniority. This differed from the second time, where each person was 20,000 yuan. The ransom prices proposed by the bandits, at the lowest limit, were 10,000 yuan for business director Shen Qinxiang, 7,500 yuan for accountant Li Xiaobin, and, because his family was poor, 2,500 yuan for tallyman Ge Liangchen. When the representative, Mr. Zhong, departed from Shanghai, he only had 2,000 yuan prepared. When he heard the amount demanded by the bandits, the gap was too large, and no results were achieved.</p>
<p>Willing to Live and Die Together　Mr. Zhong sent a letter to the families informing them of the amounts. The families of Shen and Li decided not to pay the ransom and let things take their course, because they really did not have the financial resources and were not simply disregarding the situation. However, it was heard that Ge Liangchen's ransom was the lowest. The families of Shen and Li told Ge Liangchen's family that since the three were kidnapped together, they should be united. If a ransom was paid, then all three should be redeemed. Even if the bandits reduced the price for one of the three to 200 yuan, they could not act independently to pay the ransom. They are determined to live and die together and have instructed Mr. Zhong not to continue negotiations and have decided to let things take their course. It has been more than three months since Shen, Li, and Ge were kidnapped.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Chongqi Merger Movement is Actively Underway <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Reporters Were Invited to Report on the Progress</p>
<p>And Urge the Government to Merge Chongqi as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The Chongqi merger movement was launched by the Chongming Shanghai Association, which yesterday invited the press to the Atlantic Restaurant on Simalu to explain the origins of the merger movement and its progress. Among those in attendance were the association's committee members Lu Caifu, Wu Caichen, Yang Zhenzhong, Shi Chongpeng, Lu Yinchu, Xu Peihang, Shi Rongruo, Lu Xizhen, Chen Dongbai, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report　Chairman Shi Fujiu reported, saying that the discussion of dividing Chongming to found the county of Qidong began in the early years of the Republic of China. Shi Zipei, a native of Haimen living in Waisha, repeatedly requested the division of the county, but the provincial authorities did not allow it. In the eighth year, representatives from Waisha jointly discussed solutions at the Shanghai Daoyin Office, such as adding an administrative committee for Waisha, a judicial trial officer, and dividing grain collection. Everything that could benefit the people of Waisha was taken into account, and the people of Waisha have been living in peace for a long time. However, in the seventeenth year, the county was suddenly divided, which led to a sharp increase in government expenses and land taxes, causing the people to suffer greatly. The Chongming Shanghai Association, therefore, united fellow townsmen from various places to organize the Chongqi Merger Movement and has received guidance from many gentlemen. If Chongqi is merged, 800,000 people will be able to see the light of day again.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Government　To the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and Governors of the Jiangsu Province of the National Government: This humble submission is made because we, the people of Chongming, have suffered under harsh government for a long time. This small, remote area has been divided into two counties, which has sharply increased taxes and seriously burdened the people's livelihood. Hunger and thirst plague them, and they exhaust their income and deplete their land to satisfy the insatiable appetite of those in power. The only recourse is to appeal for the swift abolition of the divided Qidong County and the correction and merger of the two areas. Only then can we strengthen the foundation and reduce waste, return politics to normalcy, recuperate and rejuvenate, and relieve the people from their distress. Otherwise, the destitute and abandoned will have no one left to rely on. Having witnessed the suffering of the people and the concerns of the homeland since the division of the county seven years ago, we feel it is our duty to break our silence and submit this summary to your consideration. The planning and demarcation of the country's territory has never been immutable. It is only by understanding the terrain, accurately assessing the people's sentiments, considering the financial capacity, and examining the actual needs that we can determine the direction of reform. In this way, the government can avoid missteps, and the people can avoid grievances. Chongming is an isolated island in the sea. The tides rise and fall, and sand accumulates to form continents. The sea changes into land, and the changes are unpredictable. Since the establishment of the prefecture in the Yuan Dynasty and the establishment of the county in the early Ming Dynasty, the city has been moved five times, and rumors have spread. It has been a time of anxiety and disintegration, but fortunately, the inner and outer sandbanks have grown together, complementing each other, and have been able to barely support themselves. Moreover, the so-called outer sandbanks are all people from our inner county who have braved the dangers of wind and waves and have worked tirelessly, carrying baskets and shovels, to cultivate the wasteland into fertile land. Every inch of land belongs to the people of Chongming, and it is their blood and sweat. Taking advantage of the natural terrain and making up for it with human effort, they have spent years and generations to build this land of Canaan, where they farm their fields, live in their houses, sing and cry. How can we bear to watch it being divided like a melon? The people of Chongming grow up by the sea and rarely see outsiders. The scholars value old virtues, and the farmers follow their ancestral customs. They are content and law-abiding, striving to be good citizens. Each has his share of farming, and there is no master-slave mentality. The amount of rent depends on the harvest, and they only know the joy of farming and do not hear the quarrels of sparrows and mice. The outer sandbanks regard the inner county as their old home, and the inner county regards the outer sandbanks as their new home. They help each other like fish forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes for a long time. There is no distinction between Chu and Han, but suddenly there is talk of drawing a dividing line, which is self-inflicted trouble and not what the people of Chongming want. Moreover, since the division of the county, the most difficult and unsolvable problem has been the financial problem. Before the division, the total budget of the county was only over 89,000 yuan, but after the division, the remaining old county of Chongming alone increased to over 489,000 yuan. Although Qidong is newly built, it is still equipped with everything it should have, increasing to over 449,000 yuan. The total has increased nearly twelve times. Even if there were copper mountains and cinnabar caves, they would be exhausted immediately. Can we say that a poor place like Chongming can bear this burden? According to the investigation, many provinces, prefectures, and counties have been abolished and merged after the reform. The most notable example is Wu County in Suzhou, which has merged two halls and three counties into one. The three Wu areas are rich and prosperous, far more so than Chongming, and yet they still implement abolition and merger to reduce waste. Chongming has a vast coastline and is not a strong county. Yet, it is forcing the people of one county to bear the government expenses of two counties. Anyone with common sense would say that this is impossible. Moreover, Chongming is a water town. In the past decade, it has been repeatedly attacked by typhoons and storm surges. Fields and villages have been engulfed by floods. Although the government has issued relief funds and charitable organizations have provided food and clothing, it is like a drop in the bucket, and the wounds are difficult to heal. Yet, huge government expenses are demanded from the dying victims, which is like asking for a crucian carp from a dried fish shop. There is no way to turn lead into gold or live on air. The strong are scattered in other places, and the weak fill the ravines. Even if one has the clever pen of the prison warden, it is difficult to describe the plight of displacement. Alas, what crime have the people of Chongming committed to face such anger? It is all because of the division of the county that they suffer this pain. For years, the elders in the villages have been running around, appealing for help, and their cries are not without reason. If the division of the county is necessary for practical reasons, then the people can endure temporary pain by destroying their homes to help, and enjoy happiness in the future. But after a careful examination of the facts, it turns out to be a big mistake. The establishment of the Republic is primarily to enlighten the people, so education is important. Those in Chongming who are in charge of education have always valued the principle of people's livelihood, treating the children of both inner and outer sandbanks equally, without any discrimination. However, the inner sandbanks have a dense population and more schools, while the outer sandbanks have sparse villages and fewer schools, but they have never stopped striving to popularize education. However, the education funds are all derived from the traditional academies and public fields, half of which are allocated by the village chiefs, and half of which are donated by the gentry and the wealthy. All of these are located in Qidong, so Chongming cannot reach them and does not receive a single drop, causing the schools to run out of food and the teachers to go hungry. Qidong is close to the water and can easily obtain resources, but they swallow everything up and leave nothing behind. Dwarfs measure the moon, and their hunger and satisfaction are different, and Chongming is already bankrupt. Recently, the rural areas have been depressed, and if we want to seek relief, we should start with dredging waterways and protecting dikes. Chongming's city is located on the coast and is in danger. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Guangxu Emperor specially allocated huge sums of money to build seawalls for defense. The village chiefs also drafted more than 5,000 acres of public fields and collected public rent specifically for annual repairs. These are also located in Qidong, but they have all been withheld, resulting in years of disrepair. It is difficult to ask the provincial treasury for repairs, and the thousands of residents near the city are in danger of being fish. Other charitable and infant care public fields in Qidong have also been seized. The villagers held the provincial government's proposal for equal division, and they argued on the basis of reason, but they were ignored. Moreover, eight years ago, Waisha proposed to run Baota, and the Yonglong Lianzhu merchants in both locations donated tens of thousands of yuan. After the establishment of the county, the money was all diverted, and no work was done. This is like raising the banner of dividing the county to carry out a deceptive scheme to seize public funds. Not only that, but the fields in Qidong are mostly the property of the people of Chongming. After the division of the county, the burden on the people of Chongming is already overwhelming. Every autumn harvest, they hope to collect the remaining ears of grain to supplement their income. Unfortunately, in the past two years, they have suffered from continuous drought and floods, and no grains have been harvested. However, the corrupt elements in Qidong still borrow from the government to pre-lend busy silver or pursue overdue taxes. If they do not comply, they will detain the landlords. On the other hand, they incite tenants to resist paying rent. Their methods are so vicious that they are alarming. This is not only borrowing the name of dividing the county to seize the public property of Chongming, but it is still not enough. They also plan to cut off the lifeblood of all the people of Chongming. This is a hidden worry about the hearts of the people and the world, and floods and wild beasts are not only a disaster for Chongming. Moreover, Chongming is suspended in a vast sea and is not connected to the mainland. It has always been known as a paradise. For three hundred years, it has never suffered from the plunder of soldiers and bandits. In recent years, however, traffic has gradually become more convenient, and ambushes are often heard. In the years of the Republic of China, in the 16th and 17th years, Waisha experienced police trouble. The people of the inner sandbanks asked for troops and transported weapons, not afraid of the trouble of supplying them. It was not long before it was suppressed. But after the division of the county, the boundaries became clear, and A blamed B, and no one was responsible. As a result, bandits and robbers were rampant in Qidong, and kidnappings were often heard, and sometimes they even affected Chongming. It is called the division of the county, but the security is even less guaranteed. The people of Chongming no longer have a day of peace and tranquility. Looking ahead, the worries are endless. In summary of the facts listed above, there is not only no need to divide the county, but the division causes disputes. According to statistics, since the establishment of Qidong, the cost of public and private funds has been more than three or four million, but nothing has been done to satisfy the people. The most obvious achievement is that a small number of founding heroes of the county have gathered their supporters, occupied the organs, colluded with corrupt elements, and suppressed the ignorant people. They have done everything they can to make money. They were once poor children, but now they are rich men. If the increased government expenses after the division are not borne by the people, then we can divide Chongming Island into dozens or hundreds of counties, and it can be left alone. If the taxes of the two counties are distributed equally after the division, and the income is measured to determine the expenditure, such as the story of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty dividing the sand and returning it to the hall, and reducing the taxes according to the land, then it can also be done without saying anything. But now, although the county territory has been cut, the taxes have increased instead of decreasing. Chongming is exhausted, and Qidong is not full. On the map, the name of the county and prefecture is falsely increased, and the people are burdened with double exploitation. It should be a family, but it is harmful to both sides. Why is this so? If the proposal to divide the county originated from the people of Chongming, then it is a self-inflicted disaster, and there is no one to blame. But it was proposed by Shi Zipei and others from Haimen who lived in Qidong. It is a strange thing to steal the owner's seat and to do the cooking. What love do Shi and others have for Chongming to do such a crazy thing? It is also seen that most of the tenants in Waisha are stupid and uneducated, and they can be intimidated and coerced, and they can be tricked and manipulated. They do not avoid the suspicion of overstepping their authority and will choose the fat to eat. However, Shi and others are ignorant and reckless people from the countryside and are not worthy of deep reproach. It is a pity that the provincial government at the time was deceived and did not consider it. It hastily asked the National Government to approve the case in a blink of an eye, which is regrettable. At that time, the Minister of Civil Affairs in Changshu was Mao from Haimen. He had just taken office and did not know the suffering of the people. He saw the addition of a county magistrate as a child's play. How can we know that the establishment of an official and the division of duties is a major event related to the country's economy and the people's livelihood? How can we allow it to be done recklessly, showing a moment's bravery and causing endless disasters to the people? According to the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Period, it is difficult to escape the responsibility of the wise. If they have a compassionate heart, they should regret their momentary recklessness and the disaster that has caused the people's souls. They must change their plans and try to make amends late. Then, it will be like untying the bell that was tied, and they can help with the merger from within. In this way, the eating of the sun and the moon will not harm the Ming Dynasty. After the division of Chongqi, the representatives of the two counties have different positions, and their opinions are different. The documents they sue each other are more than an inch thick. However, what Chongming has stated is nothing more than the unsuitability of the local geography, history, human relations, and material resources for the division, which are all facts that cannot be forced. As for what Qidong holds, it is nothing more than the inconvenience of paying taxes and lawsuits, transportation, and the imperfection of education and security facilities. Although there are some one-sided reasons, all of these should gather the spirit of social cooperation to seek progress, and it is by no means that setting up more government offices can be effective. Moreover, they have already planned and set up such things as the Waisha Administrative Committee, the Separate Trial Court, the Grain Collection Counter, the Public Ferry, the Normal School, and the Popular Arts and Crafts Institute. They have all taken shape, but what is lacking is a magnificent county hall to embellish them. However, according to the outline of nation-building, the county unit is based on local autonomy. If we must adhere to our own opinions, and say that Chongming's inner and outer sandbanks have the danger of wind and waves, which is not conducive to the unification of one county, we are being too narrow-minded. Do we not see that Japan in the east and Dinghai in Dongyue, either connect several continents into one country or combine groups of islands into one county, and there is no danger of isolation? Chongming and Qidong are separated by only a strip of water, which can be crossed by a reed. How can there be a natural moat that cannot be crossed? In short, the people of Chongming are in distress because their livelihood is difficult, and if we add more overlapping organs to squeeze them, there will be a day of disintegration. We must strive to reduce consumption and increase production. They see the harm of the division as a pain in the flesh. Over the years, they have selected representatives who have spoken themselves hoarse, and have knocked on the doors to submit their petitions. Fortunately, they have received a letter from President Jiang, which was sent to the provincial government for consideration. The letter stated that if the division is convenient, the original plan should be maintained. If it is not suitable, then even if the plan is determined, it should be corrected. This shows that you have a high-hanging mirror and understand the situation. You have swept away the gloom and revealed the light of day, giving the people of Chongming great comfort. Generally speaking, in the Republic, the will of the people is the basis for all decisions. What is convenient for the people will be implemented with all our efforts, and what is not suitable for the people will be changed immediately. We have translated the President's letter, and the merger of Chongqi is purely based on interests, without adhering to the established practice. Now, the harm of the division has been recognized, and it is necessary to correct it quickly. The people are suffering in a foreign land, and they are attached to their hometown. They cannot bear to watch their 800,000 fathers, elders, brothers, and brothers sink into the depths of suffering without lending a helping hand. Therefore, we have specially listed the various hardships and difficulties after the division, and especially the financial aspect, which is very important. Hundreds of thousands of yuan of the people's hard-earned money are spent every year to fill the pockets of the local corrupt officials, which only causes division and does not help the local area. If this is not changed, it will be difficult to continue. This makes the people of Chongming unable to sleep in peace, and they have to express their feelings fully. We have always admired your compassion and care for the people, and you must lift us out of the fire and put us on the mat. We humbly request that you examine and approve the reasons for the unsuitability of the division of Chongqi and correct the original plan by abolishing Qidong County to conform to the President's letter and the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. We are in a state of fear and trembling. We hope that you will consider this carefully.

An ambulance was dispatched, and he was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, his brain was already shattered, and he died en route. The hospital notified the police, who transferred the body to the coroner's office. His family has already arrived at the hospital.

<p>Japanese Residents in Shanghai Face Extreme Hardship</p>
<p>According to the Manchuria Daily on the 21st, last year's trade between Shanghai and Japan saw a significant import surplus for Japan, which greatly impacted the financial world. Although the Nanjing government has been working hard to prevent the outflow of silver, Shanghai is critically short of hard currency, further tightening the financial situation. In addition, the rural areas along the Yangtze River have been affected by drought, significantly reducing purchasing power. The Shanghai market is overflowing with inventory. There are 30,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai. Aside from those living on salaries, the rest are experiencing extreme hardship. As a result, complaints and curses about the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents are rife. In Nanjing, there are only 130 Japanese residents, mostly consulate staff and news reporters, with no individually-owned businesses. The situation for Japanese residents in Shandong is also very bleak. In short, the current situation of Japanese residents in China is similar to the poverty experienced in Manchuria in January of the sixth year of the Showa era.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Company, located across from the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road, Shanghai, has adopted the new scientific management methods of Mr. Ren Jinpin, in response to changes in the social economy, and is making great efforts to revitalize its operations. Recently, it has completed the following tasks: 1. Training trainees. 2. Training employees. 3. Eliminating substandard goods and stocking fresh and beautiful items. 4. Honest and substantial price reductions, such as large-size Samsung toothpaste, priced at 15 cents per tube; 34-inch rolled-edge spray-painted washbasins, priced at 25 cents each. Various national goods in more than 40 departments, such as the silk and satin department, the cloth department, the knitwear department, and the stationery department, are all being sold at significantly reduced prices. Furthermore, in response to the meaning of the Student National Goods Year, the company is making every effort to promote student supplies, such as stationery and sports equipment, and sportswear made by Dahua. These products have been specially expanded and arranged on counters separately, and are priced at cost to increase sales for the Dahua factory. This plan has been implemented and supported by Mr. Zhu Changli and Mr. Yang Jiaoqi, so major middle schools and social sports groups in Shanghai are buying these products in droves, and the company is somewhat overwhelmed. Although the weather has been gloomy for the past few days, the company's business has made significant progress. It is evident that the spirit of patriotism and support for national goods among the Chinese people is improving day by day.</p>

<p>The liquidation of Xinkang Taiji Bank in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, which announced its liquidation in the newspaper on the 8th of this month and simultaneously ceased operations, has attracted much attention in financial circles. However, the internal situation of the bank is still unclear to outsiders. It is said that the bank's shareholders are all reputable merchants with substantial shares. Yesterday, the bank's liquidator, lawyer Cai Rudong, stated that since the liquidation began two weeks ago, many creditors have come to register their claims. They are now comprehensively planning the liquidation process, both collecting debts and repaying liabilities, and also seeking to realize assets to ease his burden as the person in charge of liquidation. He will handle the liquidation seriously, taking into account the credit of the shareholders and protecting the interests of the creditors. An examination of the bank's assets and liabilities shows that they are balanced, but some assets are illiquid. In this economic downturn, selling them will take time. He asks all creditors for their understanding and patience while awaiting a resolution. As for depositors, they will be paid out proportionally as soon as the cash is collected.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Having read yesterday’s (26th) report in your newspaper from the Japanese News Alliance, regarding Jin Bofan, representative of the Shanghai International Trade Association, arriving in Kobe. The report stated: “The Shanghai National Federation of Commerce, representing the interests of the Chinese people’s businesses, has dispatched Jin Bofan, General Manager of the International Enterprise Company, as a special envoy to Japan to investigate concrete plans for economic cooperation between China and Japan, in order to express mutual sincerity and make a statement, saying that our country’s industrial and commercial circles warmly welcome Japanese goods, etc.” We were greatly surprised to read this. Our association has always aimed to promote foreign trade, and we have never heard of Jin Bofan. Moreover, after carefully examining the content of the report, it claims that he was dispatched by the National Federation of Commerce (note: the National Federation of Commerce has also denied this, as seen in today’s issue of your newspaper), which has nothing to do with our association, let alone bear the title mentioned in the report. This is clearly a mistake, and we fear that it will cause misunderstandings in all circles. We hereby send this letter to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>China International Trade Association</p>

<h3 id="e151">Mutual Generation of Sentiment and Writing <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tongyu</p>
<p>When I used to read books annotated by Jin Shengtan, I often saw the phrase "sentiment generates writing, writing generates sentiment," but I didn't quite understand its true meaning. In recent years, as I've learned to write, my thoughts naturally flow from under my pen halfway through, and the meaning of the entire piece is mostly something I hadn't thought of when I started writing. Sometimes when I'm writing a novel, I change the content of the original planned story halfway through, and create a new plan based on what comes to me as I write. As a result, someone I originally intended to write as a villain might end up being a good person, and someone I intended to write as a good person might turn into a bad one. Developing the story along with the new meaning that arises from the writing allows the entire story to be seamless without a single crack. Of course, you can achieve the greatest success by writing the characters according to a predetermined plan, but you must have extremely deep cultivation and be able to grasp the characters under your pen, not to be moved by the new realm created by the writing, that is, to grasp the writing so that it does not create a new realm beyond the original plan. Otherwise, the whole piece will appear stiff and unnatural. This is the effect of "mutual generation of sentiment and writing."</p>
<p>Therefore, sometimes when we don't intend to write a long, brilliant article, but just think of an idea and write arbitrarily, we can write something quite good. Similarly, sometimes when we are full of confidence that we will write a valuable masterpiece, we abandon the unfinished manuscript halfway through and cannot continue. The former is because our writing generates new situations (or moods), while the latter only has dead situations (or moods) and cannot generate living writing. This is also the effect of "mutual generation of sentiment and writing."</p>
<p>Those engaged in writing cultivation must train their writing to suit the intended atmosphere of the entire piece, and this atmosphere will evoke "sentiment," which is precisely what helps the development of "writing." "Mutual generation of sentiment and writing" without exceeding the scope of the intended content of an article is a necessary condition for completing a good work. But how easy is it to talk about!</p>
<p>When Alexandre Dumas fils wrote the script for La Dame aux Camélias, he forgot that this pitiful woman was a character created by his own pen, so he cried first when he wrote about the death of Camille. The Japanese female writer Hirabayashi Taiko, she cried while writing a novel, cried and then wrote, wrote and then cried, these are just examples I grabbed at random. I believe that no literary masterpiece is written without this kind of thing.</p>
<p>If the author is not moved by the characters they create, the condition of "mutual generation of sentiment and writing" cannot be achieved.</p>

<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Every year at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, my heart is often stirred up by various changes. On the one hand, I really feel that time passes too quickly, and this causes deep annoyance in my heart. Firstly, I am getting older, and people are gradually aging, and I have achieved nothing in my career! But after the beginning of spring, my thoughts change again, and my heart seems to become active. At times like these, I always like to say to myself: "Let the past roll away! The future should be properly invigorated, work hard! Restart my work, do not waste precious time and squander my limited life!"</p>
<p>After saying this, there was indeed a time when I was "single-mindedly" and "buried myself in my work" and my heart was stirred for a considerable time. But soon after, I gradually cooled down, until I relaxed into laziness.</p>
<p>This is how one year after another passed.</p>
<p>Although I can't say that I am old now, or how decadent and bored, I am not like a young man with vigor.</p>
<p>I think: This is because I am lazy, unfortunately sad, where failure lies, and the reason why I am crushed into the soil behind the giant wheels of the times. Because of my opportunistic and idle attitude, I have suffered a lot of losses. As soon as things come, when I feel that my knowledge is shallow, my skills are low, and my application is not enough, I feel so regretful, sad, uncomfortable, and sorry. ... But what's the use of this?</p>
<p>All the facts make me ashamed. Although I can say in good conscience that I am not a hopeless person, and I have indeed done some things with hardship. But this is so small.</p>
<p>Move forward, the past is only a few steps to start. Move forward, carrying my heart that has been cultivated with blood, and move forward silently.</p>
<p>Life should be full of fire. I hate my life force without the light of fire. However, I hope that I can really do something from now on. Bravely overcome my general bad habits and slip into the giant wheel of the century.</p>
<p>Slip in until life reaches the last breath.</p>
<p>Slip in until life reaches the last drop of blood.</p>
<p>Human life will continue forever without interruption.</p>
<p>The course of time will continue to advance without stagnation.</p>
<p>It is the evolution of endless progress!</p>
<p>I think from taking fire from diamonds to inventing matches, from oil lamps to electric lights, from running and taking boats to cars, trains, steamships, and airplanes; from caves and huts to high-rise buildings, from raw food to cooked food, miscellaneous food; from leaves, hemp, and leather to silk, satin, and damask ... I don't know how much time has passed and how many lives have been sacrificed to succeed.</p>
<p>This is the product of cultural progress, the accumulation of valuable human experience and the crystallization of wisdom. Although these materials cannot be enjoyed by the general public.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that everyone should be committed to culture. I feel that the working people are the true creators of culture.</p>
<p>I hope I can do this, and everyone can do this.</p>

<p>— Xia Shi</p>
<p>Inside the house, there was a brazier, and Fourth Master was leaning on a rocking chair, warming himself with his woman. As usual, the ritual officer shouted upon entering:</p>
<p>"Fourth Master! Have you eaten?" His voice was unnatural.</p>
<p>Fourth Master's eyelids flickered upward, followed by a few coughs, as a greeting.</p>
<p>The ritual officer casually sat down on a stool. He placed the brazier at his feet, his eyes staring straight at the fire inside.</p>
<p>A silent moment. The ritual officer's face felt hot, and the words swirled in his throat. He came specifically to settle the account, and if he didn't speak, it wouldn't do. So, he steeled his heart and slowly forced the words out of his throat with effort.</p>
<p>"Master! Let's settle up?"</p>
<p>"..." The Master's eyelids flickered again. After a moment, he slowly propped himself up and went into the room.</p>
<p>He took the abacus in one hand and the ledger in the other, and brought them from the room to the square table in the hall. He turned on the light, flipped through the ledger, and the abacus rattled.</p>
<p>The ritual officer rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>The abacus stopped rattling, and suddenly, it seemed as if a thunderbolt had struck from nowhere, and the master shouted:</p>
<p>"Ritual officer! In the end, you still owe fifteen dollars!"</p>
<p>Fifteen dollars! The ritual officer was startled and stood up straight, stammering:</p>
<p>"Owe that much?"</p>
<p>"How much do you say you owe? This is recorded in the books." The master immediately became impatient and coughed a few times.</p>
<p>"I borrowed sixteen strings of cash; I did more than a dozen days of work, and there were a hundred bundles of weeds, the two offset..." The ritual officer was calculating in his head.</p>
<p>"Aren't you counting the owed rent grain?" The master quickly added.</p>
<p>"Owed rent grain? When did I owe it?" The ritual officer's voice was trembling.</p>
<p>"Don't you know?" The master coughed again, pointed to the ledger, and his attitude became more moderate. "Let me tell you! Last year you owed two shi of rent grain, and this year you owe two dou and one sheng of bean rent, right? The grain is calculated at four dollars per shi, with one year's interest, totaling nine dollars and sixty cents; the beans, including interest, are calculated at two dollars; after deducting your wages and weed money, it will be... There won't be any mistakes."</p>
<p>"The rent grain from last year, wasn't it already agreed to be waived? In those years!" The ritual officer suppressed his anger and his tone seemed like a plea.</p>
<p>"Is it that easy? Waiving two shi of grain in one go." The master laughed coldly and sat back on the rocking chair.</p>
<p>"The bean rent was also waived! This year there weren't even any bean seeds."</p>
<p>"..." The master closed his eyes, said nothing, and the only sound was the cold laughter coming from his nostrils.</p>
<p>"Deduct these two items. See how much I owe?" His tone became more earnest.</p>
<p>"..." Still only the cold laughter from his nostrils.</p>
<p>"That piece of land is too bad, I have to subsidize the rent every year, I won't farm it." The ritual officer couldn't hold back a little.</p>
<p>"You won't farm that piece of land?" The master opened his eyes and looked at him. His attitude remained leisurely.</p>
<p>"I won't farm it! I don't have the capital to subsidize it." The ritual officer replied resolutely.</p>
<p>"Really won't farm it?" The master still laughed from his nostrils.</p>
<p>"I won't!"</p>
<p>"Alright then! If you don't farm it, then don't farm any of the land! My land is well-matched, good and bad, I'd rather let it go to waste." The master stood up, picked up the ledger from the table, and walked back into the room.</p>
<p>The ritual officer was so angry that he couldn't breathe, and his hands and feet were shaking. After a long time, he shouted:</p>
<p>"Then I won't farm any of it! If I don't farm the land, will I starve to death?"</p>
<p>He grabbed the brazier and ran out.</p>
<p>He broke through the darkness and entered his own house. From inside the house, a ray of light leaked out, it was a green oil lamp, flickering dimly, and his woman was spinning cotton.</p>
<p>"Too evil! See if I starve to death!" He entered the room and sat down on the bed. His face was liver-colored, and his eyes were drooped down. He was panting, shouting louder and louder, as if crying.</p>
<p>His woman couldn't make heads or tails of it, and stared at him blankly.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Damn it, too evil, I definitely won't farm the land next year!" The ritual officer only cared about shouting.</p>
<p>His woman seemed to understand somewhat, stood up, moved closer to him, and asked again:</p>
<p>"Why, Fourth Master..."</p>
<p>"That old guy is too evil, I definitely won't farm his land next year!" The ritual officer was still panting.</p>
<p>"Are you crazy? Always that ox-like temper. If you don't farm the land, what will you do? Blame yourself for being poor." His woman's tears were about to fall. Then, she smelled the smell of alcohol, and added:</p>
<p>"You're going to drink again, getting drunk like this."</p>
<p>"Who's drunk?" The ritual officer turned his eyes and stared at his woman, who was too muddled and didn't understand him. "The rent grain that was agreed to be waived last year, he's going to add interest and calculate it this year, can you bear it?"</p>
<p>His woman lowered her head, and her tears fell to the ground. "Blame yourself for being poor, can you make a fuss over him?" After saying that, she simply walked back to the stool where she was spinning cotton and sobbed.</p>
<p>"If I don't make a fuss, what then?" He has no humanity. He only sees money.</p>
<p>"I can't not farm, can I!" The woman sobbed more intensely.</p>
<p>The ritual officer stopped speaking, fell on the bed, and covered his head with both hands. At first, he was still stubbornly circling in anger, but eventually his panting gradually calmed down. His nerves, which had lost the ability to think, were awakened by his woman's crying. If he didn't farm the land, what would he do? Then he realized that ahead there was only a long and endless dark road, without sunshine, without farms, and filled only with wandering, hunger, and death. He couldn't help but sigh, and tears naturally followed.</p>
<p>"What will we do? What will we do?" He shouted crazily like a child. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e154">Random Notes on Historical Anecdotes (7) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>This section of narrative singing, in accordance with the original meaning of the Analects, expands on the conversations between the Southern hermits (Jieyu, Changju, Jieni) and Confucius's disciples with added details and embellishments. Not only is it vividly lifelike and modernized, but the meaning of the whole text is also modernized. Storytellers after the Song and Yuan dynasties and novelists who wrote chapters of novels mostly excelled in embellishment. There are teahouses where the story of a young lady instructing her maid can last for a month, which can be said to be the ultimate in embellishment. Recently, the translated text of the Analects by Mr. Juesheng, serialized in volumes 12, 1, 2, and 3 of the Guowen Weekly, also uses the method of embellishment, such as translating "The ancients did not speak rashly, fearing that they would not be able to do it themselves" as "Ancient people did not shout slogans randomly, afraid that they would not be able to do it themselves." Translating "A gentleman helps those in need, not those who are already rich" as "I would rather send charcoal in the snow than spread oil on fat!" are all very well embellished. ("Embellishment" originally meant "to extend its meaning," but now it is misused, and is interpreted as "dealing with it carelessly.")</p>
<p>"Embellishment" can be said to be a rough and broad effort. Further, I will talk about another kind of delicate effort, namely the so-called "rendering method." The predecessors created many lyrical texts, describing farewells. Jiang Yuantong's "Farewell Fu", the first paragraph reads:</p>
<p>"...Therefore, the traveler's intestines are broken, a hundred feelings are sad, the wind whistles with strange sounds, the clouds are vast with strange colors, the boat is frozen on the shore, the carriage is slowly moving on the side of the mountain; the oars are still, but do not move forward, the horse is cold and neighing without rest! ... The residents lie down in sorrow, as if something is lost, the sun sets against the wall, casting a sinking color, the moon rises above the eaves, spreading flying light..."</p>
<p>The following section describes farewells of the rich and powerful, farewells of chivalrous people, farewells of soldiers, farewells of those going to remote countries, farewells of couples, farewells of those outside the world, and farewells of those in the brothels, which are described in separate paragraphs. This theme, when it came into the hands of the Northern Song Dynasty lyricist Liu Yong, took on a new appearance. He used various methods to write about the essence of farewell, and each was different, such as in "Rain Bells":</p>
<p>"Cicadas chirping mournfully; facing the long pavilion in the evening, the sudden rain has just stopped. At the city gate, I have no mood for a farewell feast, reluctant to part, the orchid boat urges its departure. Holding hands and looking at each other with tearful eyes, I am speechless and choking... Affection has always been saddened by farewells; how can I bear the desolation of this clear autumn season! Where will I wake up tonight? On the willow bank, in the dawn wind and the remaining moon!..."</p>
<p>He never uses stories to pile up, but renders an exterior view to construct a psychological picture, which is by no means something that Jiang Yuantong's rough method could write. Later, when it came into the hands of Northern Qu writers, it was even more different. Such as Dong Jieyuan's "Romance of the Western Chamber", a folding fan of parting at the Long Pavilion:</p>
<p>"...The rain has just stopped, the evening wind is as cold as ice, and the sound of decaying willows and cicadas is mournful! I don't know when we will see each other again after today's parting? On the sleeves, tears are wiped away, lingering without end, and the secret knot of hatred is hidden on the brow, so difficult to give up, even if there are thousands of kinds of emotions, where to say it? Do not say that a man's heart is like iron stone, you can't see the red leaves all over the river, all are the blood in the eyes of the people who are separated!... The decayed grass is sad and leads to a single path, and the red maple leaves are scattered and full of the forest. There are no fixed traces in his life, like broken weeds, listening to the cold geese flying across the heavy twilight clouds. I remember the mandarin duck quilt, tonight the half wall is useless. The sight is full of thousands of kinds of sorrow; seeing the red leaves dripping and flowing, the pitter-patter of the light rain, the rustling of the west wind! The donkey whip is half swayed, the shoulders are shrugged, do not ask how light or heavy the parting sorrow is, on the horse, even the camel can't move it!"</p>

<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>"It's nothing, nothing at all." Hu Yiyuan plopped down on the sofa. At the same time, he invited the two of them to sit on the two chairs near the entrance. "Old friends should meet often! Get a room, take a bath, and have a chat while we're at it—"</p>
<p>Since there was nothing to discuss, coming here was just a waste of time. The two men hadn't expected this turn of events, so they were a little dazed. They managed dry smiles, casually looking around the room. Then, they all noticed the potbelly standing by the corner of the table — a large belly wrapped in a radiant white homespun short shirt and pants.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Hu Yiyuan stood up again. The introductions began. "This is my distant maternal uncle. He's a man of divisional commander caliber. —And this one, oh! He was my classmate during the Japanese occupation, a classmate at the East Asia Preparatory University. A new writer. —This one, hey, my uncle, don't let his short stature fool you; he's a national walking hero! Truly rare, truly rare."</p>
<p>"Hahaha!" Following the introduction, there was a burst of laughter, indicating mutual "sincere unity." "Hahaha!"</p>
<p>Then, silence returned to the room. A snow-like white light shimmered before everyone's eyes. They exchanged knowing smiles again — starting to "be humorous." However, before long, the new writer finally broke the "humor," bowing to the potbelly;</p>
<p>"To which army does your esteemed self belong?" he asked affably.</p>
<p>The potbelly seemed to have been silenced, unable to respond. In uneasy anxiety, he kept turning his belly like a globe, turning, turning. "No, no, no," a drum-like sound leaked out, one syllable at a time.</p>
<p>Clear breeze, fine rain, red mud temple, no monks returning, only swallows.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Public Education and Domestic Goods <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the term "public education" seemed not to exist yet, but the clamor to promote domestic goods was already quite loud and familiar. Public education in cities started building earlier, but the actual effects were not significantly improved, and the benefits to the unschooled masses were barely noticeable. I think the problem lies in the four words "aiming too high." If one diligently seeks practical work, those running public education would definitely not feel the current gloom.</p>
<p>Public education centers are now common in every county and relatively prosperous market town, but upon entering these places, one only sees a few daily newspapers, several kinds of magazines, plant specimens, and the usual colored birds, animals, insects, as well as some physiological models. What else? One can't find anything else. These displays have become the cliché of public education centers, the self-evident duty of those running public education. Year after year, year after year, the scope of public education seems to be like the textbooks compiled and reviewed by the Ministry of Education. I'm not saying that plant and animal specimens, physiological models, etc., are not suitable materials for the public to increase their general knowledge, but I think they are too rigid, not the expression of a progressive nation. Gentlemen serving in public education centers! Don't treat it as something for eating and sleeping, it is a sharp weapon for completing an excellent national character! Public education should be regarded as a movement. In addition to smoking and chatting, spend more time in the office, use your brains to think of ideas, what should be promoted, what should be abolished. We often see many public education centers treating the dignified office as a club for a few staff members, with string and bamboo instruments, singing and chanting to their hearts' content, like a "nursing home." They treat it as a small yamen directly under the Education Bureau, working, resting, looking lively.</p>
<p>I hope the education authorities will add a "Domestic Goods Exhibition Room" to each public education center, carefully selecting local products, guiding the audience to distinguish trademarks. Over the years, local men, women, old and young will recognize the products of their county and promote them to neighboring counties. The local products of neighboring counties are transported to this county. Such a constant flow of displays will naturally deepen the Chinese people's impression of domestic goods day by day. Everyone knows that holding domestic goods exhibitions requires dedicated venues, dedicated personnel, and is only temporary, which is not within the financial reach of every small county. This year is the Student Domestic Goods Year. To be honest, the visitors to the public education center are mostly people from the education sector and students. It is better to first display educational supplies, and then include household daily clothing, food, and drink. Building the public's awareness of domestic goods seems to be closer and more relevant than imparting other general knowledge. It will not waste government funds and will strengthen the national economic front. Let's not "aim too high"! Let's do it practically.</p>

<p>— Xin Quan</p>
<p>In schools, the most contact students have is naturally with books. Because, not counting class time, and after school, self-study, they almost always stay with books. From this, we can see the close relationship between books and general students. But here is the issue, at present, nine out of ten textbooks supplied to students by major bookstores are printed on foreign paper. In the Student Domestic Goods Year, students are actually reading books printed on foreign paper. Isn't this a completely contradictory thing? But in modern bookstores, to find a book printed on domestic paper, except for old-style thread-bound Four Books and Five Classics, it can be said that "it simply doesn't exist." If schools use the Four Books and Five Classics as textbooks, of course, it is impossible. Isn't this a deadlock? To read, one can only use textbooks printed on foreign paper. If one is willing to drop out of school because of not using foreign goods, it would be like abandoning eating for fear of choking, which seems too clumsy.</p>
<p>In fact, the solution to this problem is simply for a few bookstores that supply textbooks to switch to using domestic paper for printing! However, most bookstores have already printed the books used in the spring. If they want to switch to using domestic paper for printing, it would be difficult to do so temporarily due to cost considerations. Therefore, this problem seems difficult to solve. But we should not let it take its own course simply because it is "difficult."</p>
<p>The "Student Domestic Goods Year" has begun not long ago! We certainly hope that it can achieve good results this year and occupy the most glorious page in the Domestic Goods Year. Therefore, I am happy to bring up this textbook problem and discuss a suitable solution with the managers of various bookstores and the headmasters of schools so that general students can achieve the goal of "students not using foreign goods for anything" in this Domestic Goods Year.</p>
<h3 id="e158">After the Domestic Goods Survey <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yan</p>
<p>Ink</p>
<p>Domestic Goods — Minsheng 32%, Dahua 27%, Other 2% Total 61%</p>
<p>Non-Domestic Goods — Huatuomen 20%, Biande 14%, Paike 3%, Other 2% Total 39%</p>
<p>Pencils</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Pencils — Dahua 75%</p>
<p>Non-Domestic Goods Pencils — 25%</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Fountain Pens — Boshi 12%, Guan Lemin 9%, Other 8% Total 29%</p>
<p>Non-Domestic Goods Fountain Pens — Paike 35%, Kangkeling 20%, Other 16% Total 71%</p>
<p>Paper (Including Exercise Books, Stationery, Draft Paper, etc.)</p>
<p>Domestic Goods — 30% Non-Domestic Goods — 70%</p>
<p>In our middle school of five hundred people, I spent three days running through classrooms and dormitories and made the above survey report. This time, I only took paper, ink, and pencils as the scope. The purpose is to know in our Student Domestic Goods Year, where have these most important "Four Treasures of the Study" reached now? That is, what achievements have our students made in rejecting non-domestic "Four Treasures of the Study?" Although my survey cannot be entirely accurate, and because of space constraints, I cannot divide it carefully, I firmly believe that this cannot but be considered an epitome of the beginning of the Student Domestic Goods Year.</p>
<p>I am very pleased that domestic pencils account for 75% of pencils, and ink accounts for 61%. At the same time, I also suspect that imported fountain pens actually occupy a position of 71% among them. Of course, a large part was bought before, but in the Student Domestic Goods Year, we have to consider this a big black spot. Domestic paper accounts for 30%, which I think is too little. Although everyone knows that the production of domestic paper is small, there has never been news of it being sold out. Therefore, I hope that its percentage will gradually be above that of imported goods.</p>
<p>Now let's calculate the average. It's very simple. We find that domestic goods account for 40% and imported goods account for 51%. I have thought that this difference of 2%, or even the entire 51%, is the weakness of our Student Domestic Goods Year. From this weakness, a country can suffer from a very dangerous anemia.</p>
<p>In short, the burden of the Student Domestic Goods Year is heavy, and this burden needs to be borne by all the people.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Student in the Student Domestic Goods Year <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Promoting domestic goods, of course, is not limited to men and women, but the responsibility of students is especially important. Therefore, promoting domestic goods must start with students." These words are what I often talk about with people.</p>
<p>Why should promoting domestic goods start with students? Because students are the backbone of society, the pillars of the country. Their knowledge is rich, their hearts are pure, their emotions are fervent, and their actions are courageous. What society and the country expect of students is also very sincere. If promoting domestic goods can be entrusted to young students, I think there will definitely be considerable achievements.</p>
<p>Last year was the Women's Domestic Goods Year officially designated by various organizations. Although the results of the women's efforts cannot fully satisfy us, their contribution to publicity and advocacy, as well as the invisible reduction of the number of excess imports, is indelible. Someone said, "Women's abilities are ultimately inferior to men's, so the achievements ultimately cannot have significant expression." However, just how much higher are men's abilities than women's, or whether women's abilities are truly inferior to men's, is not only an educational problem but also a big problem between men and women, which can be set aside here. At the same time, from another perspective, this year is the Student Domestic Goods Year officially designated by various organizations. Although there are also female students participating in the student population, male students still account for the absolute majority. Therefore, how will the results of this year's Student Domestic Goods Year be? It can be regarded as a touchstone for whether men's abilities are higher than women's.</p>
<p>Dear young students, your great mission must begin to be borne from today! I very much hope that you will bravely accept it and have the determination that "promoting domestic goods is my sole responsibility." Whether it's clothing, food, or use... etc., you must choose to buy domestic goods, and you must not be sloppy anymore. You must know that students are the role models of society. If students can conscientiously use domestic goods, then, since people are inclined to do good, who is not like me? The general public will naturally be able to change their views, and this great effect of changing customs and habits will truly be attributed to the lovely and respectable young students.</p>
<p>Good, this year is the Student Domestic Goods Year, let the students do it! Here, I pre-wish the Student Domestic Goods Year success.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Domestic Goods News of the Week <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to promote trade in domestic goods in Southeast Asia and improve the lives of overseas Chinese, has specially sent Chen Shoupou, Liang Yugao, and Zheng Lin to Southeast Asia for inspection. Mr. Chen and others sent a special letter to Wu Zhihao, a member of the Standing Committee of the China National Products Production and Sales Association, soliciting the opinions of various manufacturers. Mr. Wu replied with six points: (1) setting up commercial attachés, (2) opening domestic goods exhibition halls, (3) establishing domestic goods promotion agencies, (4) establishing banks in various ports in Southeast Asia, (5) laying shipping routes, (6) mutual inspections at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Xue Shouchan, a silk magnate in Wuxi, recognizing the decline of China's silk industry and the sluggishness of exports, will depart soon to inspect the silk industries of the United States, France, Germany, and Japan for learning. He is scheduled to return home in eight months.</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, believing that the development of the Japanese textile industry is worthy of learning, has specially sent Hui Zhidao and Zou Ruchui to Japan for inspection.</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau is scheduled to convene more than 30 weaving factory owners in this city at 3:00 PM today (28th) to discuss ways to promote domestic bleached cloth to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The Domestic Goods Movement Boost Conference initiated earlier by the China National Products Manufacturers Association has now applied to the party and government agencies for record-keeping and has borrowed the open space of the Penglai Market as the venue. It is scheduled to officially open on March 15th.</p>
<p>The Wuxi National Exhibition initiated by the China National Products Factories Association has now found the old site of the National Products Market on Gongyuan Road as the venue. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held tomorrow (1st). The exhibition period is set for about three weeks.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in order to promote domestic goods, has re-stipulated tax exemption and reduction measures for domestic goods exhibits. However, the certificate must be obtained from the Ministry. Yesterday, it has consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government for verification.</p>
<p>The Special Committee of the Mechanical Engineering Association held its first meeting on the 23rd, first studying the content of the regulations for the management of automotive machinery, and publicly elected Cai Shengbai and others as conveners.</p>
<p>The Shaoxing National Exhibition was originally scheduled to open on March 1st, but due to insufficient preparation, it has been postponed to March 5th. More than 50 companies have registered. In addition, the Anhui Province Wutun Road Along-the-Line Products Exhibition will also open soon, promoting along the road.</p>
<h3 id="e161">My Plan for the Student Domestic Goods Year <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>After the Women's Domestic Goods Year, it is our turn for the Student Domestic Goods Year. Some people may think that the foreign goods used by students are very limited. Speaking of the books they read, if they are only published abroad, they have to buy them. Why necessarily name it the Student Domestic Goods Year? I think that students are the masters of China, and their every move in the future will have a great impact on the rise and fall of the country. If they have a recognition of domestic goods in the current era of schooling, then China's national industry may be revitalized even more in the future. For this reason, I will write this plan.</p>
<p>1.  Start with oneself: At present, people who generally promote domestic goods wear foreign goods and persuade people everywhere to use domestic goods. Do you think that this kind of person who cares only about words and not actions can do this work? Starting with oneself, in addition to promoting domestic goods by oneself, one can also reform the inferior habit of society using foreign goods. If the manager wears domestic clothes and a domestic hat, then the staff members will also have to use domestic goods.</p>
<p>2.  Introduce domestic goods: In addition to using domestic goods oneself, one must also introduce them to people who do not know that there are domestic substitutes. For example, if you see your friend using a foreign fountain pen, you should respectfully say to him: "Brother, the Guan Lemin and Xinmin fountain pens of Chinese goods are indeed almost the same as foreign products, and the price is not expensive. China National Products Company has them for sale." Then, invisibly, you have helped the revitalization of domestic goods.</p>
<p>3.  Visit domestic goods factories: This year, I hope to visit domestic goods factories more in my spare time. First, I can understand the lives of the domestic goods industry, and second, I can increase my knowledge. This is of great significance.</p>
<p>4.  Read more books about domestic goods and write more articles about domestic goods: I plan to buy more books about the national domestic goods industry situation in various places, and customs statistics on the import and export of domestic and foreign goods. The former will make me understand the real situation, and the latter will let me know the success or failure of the domestic goods movement. Therefore, I will write many feelings into articles.</p>
<p>The above four points are my personal plan. I hope that students will cooperate and do a solid job. I also hope that I will not be all talk and no action and not persevere in doing it. Then, on the last day of this year, in my own diary, I will write: "Although I am still the same this year, there has been some achievement in the domestic goods work. The number of factories visited has reached fourteen. Thanks to the enthusiastic guidance of the various factories, I have benefited a lot. The domestic goods discussion group has been established for several months and the results are very good. The members have worked hard to cooperate, and there are many sponsors. However, the direction of progress needs to be discussed next year." At that time, how happy I should be!</p>
<h3 id="e162">"Wealth and Honor to Old Age" <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Gao</p>
<p>"Having wealth and resources to enjoy wealth and honor, having a virtuous wife to grow old together." This is, of course, the supreme happiness in life. People toil and busy themselves all day long, nothing more than for this purpose.</p>
<p>But in these times of national hardship and social unrest, how many people can enjoy such perfect happiness? Aren't most people still dying prematurely in suffering?</p>
<p>Like Mr. Xiang Songmao, a well-known figure in China's industrial circles, he originally had a happy family, but he was tragically killed during the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident! However, although Mr. Xiang did not enjoy the happiness of "wealth and honor to old age," his death was for the country—for saving people. This spirit of sacrifice is truly great! His name can be immortalized forever; no wonder that when the third anniversary of Mr. Xiang's martyrdom was held this year, the people who participated were all moved to tears.</p>
<p>The Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap Factory has a kind of exquisite soap, the name of which is "Wealth and Honor to Old Age Soap." I think this name contains a profound meaning, and this meaning hints: promoting domestic goods can enrich the country and make the people prosperous. If everyone can purchase and use domestic goods, then profit rights will no longer flow out, the social economy will be stable, and people will all have the opportunity to enjoy perfect happiness.</p>
<p>Finally, I say: "May the Chinese people be able to consistently promote domestic goods, and may the Chinese people who promote domestic goods be able to enjoy wealth and honor to old age!"</p>

<p>Next Year's Berlin Conference</p>
<p>Football Program Passed</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Oslo, 26th) The International Olympic Committee will hold a plenary meeting this Friday to vote and decide on the location for the 1940 World Games. Tomorrow and Thursday, Italy, Japan, and Finland will each propose their capital cities as candidate locations for the 1940 World Games. At today's plenary meeting of the International Committee, the German representative reported on all the preparations for next year's Berlin World Games. In addition to all the programs from previous sessions, next year's World Games will include a football competition. According to the latest International Football Association, it is permitted to include football in the Olympic program, but with the condition that the participating teams should consist exclusively of players who are not paid salaries or rewards.</p>
<p>(Japan United Press, Oslo, 26th) The location for the 12th Olympic Games in 1940 will be decided on the final day of the committee, March 1st.</p>
<p>(Japan United Press, Oslo, 26th) The competition for the location of the Olympic Games is currently between Japan, Italy, and Finland, and the situation is chaotic, making predictions impossible. However, based on information from various sources, Japan is expected to receive a total of 22 votes, including those from the United States, Germany, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, Australia, Sweden, India, and Mexico. The attitudes of Argentina, China, Chile, Peru, Cuba, Greece, Belgium, and Central American countries are still unclear. If these countries vote for Japan, Japan will have an absolute majority.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Ping City Cross-Country Race <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Niu Qunzhi Wins Senior Group Championship</p>
<p>Luo Qinglong Lacks Endurance and is Defeated</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) The Beiping City Cross-Country Race has been prepared for days by the Social Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and other departments and is now ready. The contestants from all parties participating in the competition gathered in front of Tiananmen Square one after another around 8:00 AM on the 24th. The sportswear worn by the participants varied, some wearing绒球 coats, some wearing vests, some wearing 灯笼裤, and some wearing shorts, showing no uniformity. At 9:45 AM, the Director of the Social Bureau arrived and shook hands with the athletes. Participants and spectators from all sides also arrived one after another, totaling about 500 people. First, Li Zhou reported the competition rules once. Then, everyone began taking photos. At 10:00 AM, the roll call was taken, and Commander Wang Zhensheng fired the starting gun. The contestants immediately began the race.</p>
<p>After hearing the gun, the contestants started together. The senior group headed east towards South Chizi, and the intermediate group headed west towards South Chang Street, going their separate ways. The spectators along the route were packed, and applause erupted. The atmosphere became tense as they passed various locations. At 10:30 AM, the intermediate group had already run out of Xisi Gate and past the Xisi Archway. As they reached the entrance to Huguosi Street, the senior group suddenly burst out from Huguosi Street. The leading general was Niu Qunzhi of the 32nd Army, and the entire team followed, running one after another.</p>
<p>The two groups accidentally met on the road, and the contestants competed with each other, striving to be first. At Xizhimen, traffic was temporarily stopped. At 10:40 AM, as the contestants were sweating and panting on the road, Luo Qinglong, a strong competitor from Tsinghua, suddenly surged from behind, leaping forward and passing everyone. At the same time, the Tsinghua cheering car also arrived, shouting "Ah Luo! Faster!" Luo Qinglong nodded and stepped up his efforts, sprinting ahead. About dozens of steps out of Xizhimen, the senior group changed course and turned north, heading straight for Tsinghua University. The intermediate group headed west, striving forward. He Chunbo of Huiwen College, with angry eyes and gritted teeth, was the first to reach the finish line at the Agricultural Experiment Field, taking about 32 minutes and 12 seconds. Fei Jingtian of Yuying College arrived second. A total of 32 members of the intermediate group reached the finish line one after another, with three dropping out midway.</p>
<p>As for the senior group, after leaving Xizhimen and turning north, Niu Qunzhi of the 32nd Army remained the vanguard. When he was about to reach Haidian, Niu Qunzhi charged forward like a fierce tiger leaving its cage, rushing far ahead. He reached the finish line in just one hour and ten minutes. Liu Qingling of Tsinghua arrived second. Luo Qinglong, although fast, lacked stamina and fell behind midway, finishing in 19th place, which is truly a pity. The names of the top 20 in the senior and intermediate groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Senior Group (1) Niu Qunzhi (32nd Army) (2) Liu Qingling (Tsinghua) (3) Zhao Qinghai (32nd Army) (4) Zhang Lin (Anti-Aircraft Artillery Team) (5) Chai Senlin (Normal University) (6) Zhao Xin (32nd Army) (7) Zhang Cuntang (Same as above) (8) Zhao Fuxian (Same as above) (9) Bai Qingxiang (Anti-Aircraft Artillery Team) (10) Liu Kaiming (32nd Army) (11) Sun Guohui (32nd Army) (12) Li Jinfu (32nd Army) (13) Wang Wancang (32nd Army) (14) Shi Fuheng (32nd Army) (15) Guo Chaosong (32nd Army) (16) Li Xichun (32nd Army) (17) Shen Yuebo (Anti-Aircraft Artillery Team) (18) Li Hengyou (Fu Jen Catholic University) (19) Luo Qinglong (Tsinghua) (20) Nan Yongchang (32nd Army)</p>

<p>Since the Youyou Cup basketball tournament began soliciting old members, the deadline has passed.

<p>To the Honorable Editor, Greetings. Our team played against the Qingzhong team in the Middle-School Youth Basketball Association Grade 3 Championship at 5:45 PM on January 25th. Our team won 44 to 38. However, we read in the newspaper that "The Qingzhong team protested against the Sanyu team members." We were extremely surprised to read this. After investigation, our team did not have any unregistered players participating in the match, and our team members also did not participate in the Shanghai Basketball Association or the Xiqing Association's Division B. In the match that day, in addition to the original personnel, player No. 22, Sheng Zhibei, was indeed registered (with photo evidence). Now that the team has fabricated facts, the Sanyu team will not recognize the unfair judgment. (The rest is omitted.) Sanyu Basketball Team, Qingzhong Middle School, Jiangwan.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Decline of Northeast Culture: Current Situation of Slave Education in Liaoning and Jilin <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Dalian Establishes Industrial School but Implementation Difficult Due to Lack of Funds</p>
<p>Jilin's Funding Becomes Increasingly Tight, School Buildings Collapse, and Five Schools Merge</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency) Northeast education is declining due to the continuous cultural aggression of the Japanese. Therefore, Northeast youth today not only suffer from the pain of being out of school but also from the harm of Japanese anesthetic education. After receiving their slavish training, their ambition to save our motherland and their impression of the motherland gradually fade away. In this environment, the future of Northeast youth is truly dangerous and heartbreaking. The recent education situation in Liaoning and Jilin provinces is described below:</p>
<p>Liaoning (1) (Fengcheng County News) Sun Xiaolin, the president of the Fengcheng Education Association, has resigned because the violent Japanese forced him to implement slave education too excessively, which went against his conscience. The deputy president, Yuan Qinghe, has been temporarily appointed by the puppet county government to act as president. However, the term of office of the president and vice president of the association is about to expire, so the puppet county government used this reason to request approval from the puppet Fengtian Education Association to elect the president and vice president in advance. The association has now notified the principals and educators of all schools in Fengcheng County that they must be present to vote when the time comes. (2) He Qintang, the director of the puppet education bureau of Fengcheng County, is now trying to please the Japanese and show his efforts to promote slave education as the winter vacation ends and school is about to start. He is holding an educational conference at the site of the County No. 4 Elementary School, gathering principals of various county, district, village, and private schools. The puppet education bureau is actively preparing, and the principals of various schools have reported one after another. When the conference is held, the Japanese council officer will be invited to give guidance and instructions. (3) The Japanese authorities in Dalian City intend to win over the hearts of the people of the Northeast and implement slave education, so they plan to establish the Second Industrial School in Dalian. The construction cost is 150,000 yuan. The Japanese are using a "benevolent" policy, forcing the three chambers of commerce in Dalian to raise the funds. The three chambers of commerce held separate meetings to discuss the matter. Because the amount of 150,000 yuan was too large, they politely declined. Therefore, the mayor of Dalian criticized the associations for not being enthusiastic about public welfare and not being able to promote education. Therefore, in recent days, joint meetings of the boards of directors and presidents of the chambers of commerce and meetings of city councilors have been held to discuss why Dalian is urgently ordering the chambers of commerce to bear such a large sum of money and whether this urgent measure is inappropriate. In the end, the approval of raising funds was not passed.</p>
<p>Jilin (1) (Jilin News) Zhang Xiaozhai, the director of the puppet education department of Jilin Province, followed the orders of the Japanese after the implementation of the puppet new provincial system and abolished the original school names of the affiliated secondary schools, that is, the "number" of the previous schools, and implemented the new system, uniformly prefixing the school name with the name of the place to distinguish them and show uniformity. The puppet department has now completed the renaming of the various provincial-run coeducational secondary schools. The former Provincial No. 1 Normal School was renamed Jilin Provincial Normal School, the former Jilin Provincial No. 1 Engineering School was renamed Jilin Provincial Engineering Middle School, the former Jilin Provincial No. 2 Normal School was renamed Changchun Normal School, the former Jilin Provincial Women's Normal School was renamed Jilin Provincial Jilin Two-Level Women's Normal School, the former Jilin Provincial No. 1 Middle School was renamed Jilin Provincial Jilin Two-Level Middle School, the former Jilin Provincial No. 2 Middle School was renamed Jilin Provincial Changchun Junior Middle School, the former Jilin Provincial No. 5 Middle School was renamed Jilin Provincial Jilin Junior Middle School, and the former Jilin Provincial Women's Middle School was renamed Jilin Provincial Jilin Junior Women's Middle School. (2) The Provincial Jilin Normal School (No. 1 Normal School) in the East Suburb of Jilin Province is now facing the problem that its original school buildings are mostly dilapidated and difficult to support due to years of disrepair. If this continues, it is feared that there will be danger. Moreover, the puppet education department cannot allocate funds for construction and repair due to financial difficulties. It is planned to move the entire school to the old site of the police department outside Deshengmen to avoid unexpected dangers. Preparations for the relocation have begun in order to start school as soon as possible. This shows the puppet education authorities' financial difficulties and their disregard for the lives of students. (3) The Jilin Municipal Middle School on Beida Street in Jilin Province has been approved by the puppet municipal preparatory office and received by the puppet provincial government for management due to financial difficulties. The puppet government will receive it and plans to merge the school with four provincial-run middle schools with financial difficulties and rename it Jilin Provincial Jilin Junior Middle School. It has been internally decided that Zhao Hongjun, a Japanese meritorious official and traitor who implements slave education, will serve as the principal and become a tool for the Japanese to promote cultural aggression. It is said that the appointment of the principal will be announced within days.</p>

<p>The funding for the first half of February for Jiangsu Provincial Rural Normal School and Provincial Primary Schools (for vocational schools, social education institutions, and normal schools, it is the funding for the second half of January, and for middle schools, it is the funding for the first half of January) was notified by the Education Funding Management Office, and each school can withdraw the funds from the bank around the 28th of this month (because the written form is due on the 28th). The funding notification for the second half of February for rural normal schools and primary schools (and the funding for the first half of February and the second half of January for the rest) has been signed by the audit committee on the 25th.

<p>The 300,833 yuan of educational subsidies for Shaanxi Province was previously allocated from the provincial salt tax. Now, the Ministry of Finance has recovered it and established a bureau to collect it. According to the special regulations during the provincial management era, the provincial education special funds allocated from tax funds will still be allocated according to the special case. As it concerns subsidizing local education, the 300,833 yuan of subsidies will still be disbursed as before. This has been resolved and passed by the Central Political Conference and has been ordered by the National Government to be handled by the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</p>

She also has a deep understanding of literature and art and is particularly interested in women's education. This lecture is sure to be wonderful and can serve as a reference for Chinese women of the new era.</p>

<p>The Northwest Territory is Vast, Making Recognition Difficult Without Personal Visits</p>
<p>Please Urge Students to Take More Trips to the Northwest</p>
<p>Chen Lifu, Chairman of the Developing the Northwest Association, recently sent letters to various universities, stating that since the September 18th National Crisis, government authorities and people from all walks of life have regarded the development of the Northwest as an essential plan for the country today. However, the Northwest territory is vast, and the social situation is complex, making thorough understanding difficult without personally visiting the region. In recent years, many people have gone to the Northwest for on-the-spot investigations or sightseeing tours, but this endeavor is rarely seen among young students. In fact, the Northwest is the birthplace of Chinese culture, with simple folk customs, abundant products, famous historical sites everywhere, and unique scenery no less impressive than that of the Southeast. Moreover, the local area has been peaceful recently, the Longhai Railway has been extended to Xi'an, and highways in various provinces have gradually developed, making transportation very convenient. If young students take advantage of their holidays to organize groups for sightseeing tours, they can not only broaden their personal horizons but also shift social attitudes. It is hoped that your esteemed Principal will encourage students to take more trips to the Northwest, so that they can inform the people of the country with their research findings, or use a particular Northwest issue as material for their university graduation thesis. If the trend catches on and the whole country is stirred up, the future prosperity of the Northwest will be greatly contributed to.</p>

<p>The private Minzhi Elementary and Middle School in this city has been established for ten years.

<p>The Foreign Exchange Market Continues to Ease, and the Gold Market, Although Rising, Still Falls</p>
<p>New Low Price of 872 Yuan, Resulting in a Slight Drop of Two Dimes</p>
<p>The gold market trend is extremely weak, and the decline is endless. Only when there are rumors of the Central Bank opening for cash can the buyers become active, and the market can rebound in the middle. However, the banks' selling appetite is extremely strong, the exchange market lacks maintenance, and hedging takes the opportunity to sell off. People's hearts are inherently fearful, and the chips have been reduced to more than 18,000. The shorts are fearless, and the buyers are at a loss. A new low price of 872 yuan has been created. It is found that at the beginning of the morning, although the overseas gold markets in England and the United States rose, they did not rise much. London raw gold fell by three pence, and the off-site pre-market trading opened at 73.4 yuan. Taking advantage of the low price, there was a sudden short covering, and the price gradually rose. The Central Bank's listing was announced, and both the British and American markets were flat, and the customs gold unit fell by three cents. The standard gold price was 933 yuan and eight dimes, which had no impact. The morning opening was high. Although it was slightly flat and tired after opening, it broke through the 80 yuan mark due to large buyers entering the market. The exchange market tightened, and rumors spread that the Central Bank was opening for cash, and the price rose once. However, because the Bank of Japan continued to push out, and it was known in advance that the HSBC listing would rise again, the price gradually fell back. Although there was hovering, once the 80 yuan mark was broken, the buying interest decreased again. The banks pushed out again and again, and the exchange market was extremely tight. Under the hedging sell-off, the supply exceeded the demand, and it was difficult to maintain. A new low price of 872 yuan was created again, and then there was more trading. However, Sassoon was willing to fill shillings first, and the Hong Kong side also had selling positions. Although the price rose, it lacked strength and repeatedly reported downstream. However, the buyers were still willing to become active when the price was low. After hovering, rumors that the Central Bank was opening for cash spread again, and people's hearts were slightly shaken, and the price suddenly rebounded. However, it did not break through the 80 yuan mark. However, the banks were still selling off, and the exchange market was loose and excessive. Dalian Gang and others sold off in succession.

The March registered price was 870 yuan, and the April price was 876 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 858 yuan.

<p>Foreign Exchange Banks Have a Large Selling Appetite</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, London large contracts rose by 0625 recently and 125 distantly. New York silver prices rose by 125.

The Central Bank's listing was announced, and both British and American currencies were flat, and the customs gold unit fell by three cents. The exchange market was not greatly affected. Although the banks pushed out after opening, the psychological state of Chinese businessmen was relatively stable. Rumors spread that the Central Bank was opening for cash, and the process changed from loose to tight. The Bank of Japan still pushed out when prices were high. The HSBC Bank listing was announced, with the British currency rising by 125 and the US currency rising by 25, but it was difficult to maintain. Before long, it became harder again. Although Chinese businessmen were trying to switch, the banks were eager to sell. Sassoon also had a selling appetite. The process was loose and excessive. After entering, although there were rumors that the Central Bank was opening for cash, the exchange market was completely unaffected. Banks continued to sell off, and Chinese businessmen, except for the Dalian Gang, were generally unenthusiastic. The Hong Kong side also had selling positions, which made it even harder at noon. The trend continued to loosen after the close. As the recession became more and more serious, banks and money houses did not dare to lend money, which severely hit the import business. The future of the exchange market is difficult to be optimistic. The noon close selling price for the near term British currency was one shilling, seven pence, and 125, and the US currency was 38.75 yuan, which was 0625 looser for the British currency and 125 harder for the US currency compared to the previous close.

<p>Public Bonds Inevitably Fluctuating</p>
<p>—Spot Trading of Silk Industry Bonds Begins—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua Shang Securities Exchange's April futures market opened. Except for the "18 Customs Bonds" and "Jin Chang Three Types" which were not yet traded, all others opened. On the first day, there were swap transactions, and trading was relatively active. The market started strong but then weakened. However, the "23 Customs Bonds" gradually became firm. After the previous sharp decline, a period of fluctuation is temporarily expected. The future trend will likely maintain its current level. The market outlook may fluctuate for some time.

The "23 Customs Bonds" were also firm. In the afternoon session, selling pressure increased slightly.

The opening and closing sessions in the afternoon saw slightly more selling of the "29," "31," and "35" bonds, and both sessions were weak. However, the "23 Customs Bonds" remained very firm.

<p>New York Stock Market Reports Universal Declines</p>
<p>According to a report from the Sin Fung Trading Company, yesterday (the 26th), the New York stock market declined, led by railway stocks. According to the business statistics first released by seventeen railway companies, although the gross profit of these railways in January this year increased by 17% compared with the same period last year, the net operating income decreased by 18.3%. The Baldwin Locomotive Works filed for reorganization under Section 77B of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, which also caused railway material stocks to fall. London spot tin reached a new high price today, at 25 pence and 5625 points, reportedly due to continued purchases from China and India. The New York silver price was 55.5 cents, only 2.5 cents away from the highest peak since 1929. Wall Street observers are paying close attention to the situation of London tin. A certain private bullish company there holds 5,000 tons of tin. Because of the sharp fall in prices, unless the bank provides assistance, there is a danger of collapse. In addition, there is also a so-called government buffer bullish company established by the International Silver Committee to balance prices, which also holds 8,000 tons of tin. The bond market trended lower, led by railway bonds. Small exchange stocks also fell. The total daily turnover was 950,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>

<p>Quiet Spot Yarn Trading on Settlement Day</p>
<p>The yarn market is quiet. The standard cotton yarn market was closed for one day due to the handling of settlement matters at the end of the month. Spot yarn trading is still manageable, and prices are average. However, according to market reports, a certain yarn northern merchant group purchased 500 bales, and the market price rose by five cents. Another report indicates that a bullish company was organized this month, preparing to buy in at low prices, so the rise in price on the previous day was more aggressive. However, a rise in actual sales is still needed. It is found that customer merchant groups bought 300 bales, and the market price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each merchant group is as follows:</p>

<p>The February futures contract for "Golden Rooster" brand yarn began trading on September 1st of last year, with a price of 182.9 yuan. After a slight increase to over 185 yuan, the United States implemented a silver purchasing policy, and the silver price rose sharply, which was first unfavorable to commodity prices in our country. Japanese merchants sold actively, and the market became more difficult to maintain. The lowest point was 174.5 yuan. By mid-October, after the National Government increased export taxes on silver, gold prices soared. At the same time, there were frequent rumors about paper money, and the yarn price also soared at one point. The concept of inflation, after a long period of fluctuation last year, reached a high point of 188.9 yuan. Recently, a financial panic occurred in Shanghai, and credit tightened sharply. There were still more than 2,000 bales of yarn due. There were fewer acceptors of this goods, and the market turned sharply downward, breaking through the 180 yuan mark. The last session was 174.5 yuan, 8.5 yuan lower than the January price. The settlement price was 176 yuan. As a result, only 3,200 bales remained.

<p>The February futures contract for cotton began trading on September 1st of last year, with a price of 35 yuan. After rising to 36.05 yuan, new cotton entered the market, and the yarn market did not rise, falling to 33.45 yuan. On October 18th, due to the increase in silver tax, gold prices soared, and public sentiment was aroused. The cotton market was greatly shaken, with one session soaring by 1.89 yuan. At the same time, two major cotton companies manipulated the market, and rumors about paper money were rampant in the market. The buying pressure became stronger and stronger, fluctuating at a high point of 38.56 yuan. After three months, by mid-February, financial panic occurred in Shanghai, and money houses and banks were frequently closing down and going bankrupt. Market flaws suddenly appeared, and prices fell step by step, with the lowest price breaking through the 35 yuan mark, at 34.6 yuan. The settlement price was 35 yuan. As a result, 7,500 loads remained, including 2,000 loads of "Yao" cotton and 300 loads of Shandong coarse velvet cotton. The rest were self-settled.

<p>Tianjin Spot Yarn Sales Are Ordinary</p>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The cotton yarn market in this city is extremely depressed. The decline in Shanghai futures has had a significant impact. Customers have heard bad news and are hesitant to move forward. The intake of goods from all parties is stagnant. The market price of Tianjin factory yarn is listed below (including consolidated tax):</p>
<p>32 count San Sheng Yarn 223.50 Gaoyang merchant group intake 5 bales</p>
<p>16 count San Guang Yarn 173.00 Suning merchant group intake 10 bales</p>
<p>Also San Ji Yarn 171.50 Suning merchant group intake 10 bales</p>

<p>March Futures U.S. Cotton Bull Closing</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with mixed trading. Nearby months fell by 2 points, while distant months rose by 2 points. Operators in the market did not dare to act because the March delivery notice reached 16,500 bales. However, the March contracts were all absorbed and seemed unlikely to increase further, because Japanese merchants and spot merchants were willing to buy, and Liverpool and short accounts also intended to cover. Unfortunately, demand was flat, leading to a reverse reaction with the March contract closing out bullish positions. At the close, there was slight short covering, and the market price did not move. It is reported that 6 million bales of government-managed cotton will be stockpiled, but this is still not enough to encourage buyers. Spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures rose or fell by 1-2 points. The British cotton market was flat. Spot prices did not move. Nearby months fell by 1 point, and distant months rose by 1 point. Indian cotton first fell due to European exporters selling July "White Roller Creek" cotton, but then recovered due to a few speculators buying. Plain "Ping Guo Er" fell by 2 rupees, "Ao Mu La" fell by 1.25 rupees, and "Bai Luo Xi" fell by 1.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (telegram of the 26th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for "Bai Luo Xi" cotton on the 27th was 2,147 rupees, an increase of 0.25 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>

<p>Spot Flour Is Tight, Futures Market Improves</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, showed a trend of initial fatigue followed by a rise in each month's contract. Chicago and Canada wheat quotations both improved by 4 cents to 16 cents. When the opening price was quoted, the market atmosphere for each month initially appeared flat and tired. The March contract initially fell to as low as 3.7 cents due to excessive long positions selling out. However, factory prices for distant months did not change, and sentiment stabilized. Therefore, the market atmosphere gradually improved after the second session. Furthermore, spot flour is currently tight, and some factories are saying that the standards are declining, and that the spot market will open separately in the future. Therefore, customer merchant group thoughts seem to be active again. Until the afternoon opening, this month's contract was in the last few sessions of trading, and both parties were mostly closing positions mutually, and the market atmosphere remained stable. Distant months were seen as stable because of the tight supply of spot flour, and the opening price showed an upward trend. As a result, this month's contract improved by half a cent, March to June rose by 1.75 cents, and July rose by 2.25 cents.</p>
<p>Futures Wheat Market Pulls Up Flour Market</p>
<p>February Wheat Delivery 53 Cars</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the morning and afternoon openings, showed a trend of initial flatness followed by stability in each month's contract. Chicago and Canada wheat quotations both improved by about 4 cents to 16 cents. At the initial opening in the morning, trading was not brisk. March and April prices initially did not move, then improved by 2 cents. Until the afternoon sessions, the flour market rebounded, and spot flour was selling very smoothly, so sentiment also improved. The March contract rose by 6 cents compared to the previous day, the April contract rose by 2 cents, and the July new wheat standard was also flat in the morning, then gradually improved by 3 cents. The spot wheat market remained stable. "Kai Bengbu" wheat was quoted at 3.84 yuan, and "Huangqiao" wheat was quoted at 3.82 yuan, totaling 1,000 bags, which were taken by Shen Da and Xin Da. February wheat delivery has reportedly been cleared, with a total of 53 cars delivered. Most of them were delivered by Tai Fu, including 46 cars of foreign wheat and only 7 cars of local wheat. The recipients were all factories, including Fu Xin, Shen Da, and Xin Da.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat, manufacturers bought the May contract, and the price rose due to the damage to winter wheat belt in the southwest by storms and stable foreign telegrams. The market encountered the usual selling pressure.</p>
<p>Riverbank Rice Market Sales Are Stagnant</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of goods from each merchant group were similar to before, still only 20-odd (a total of more than 4,000 stones of goods). Sales in the morning market on this street were flat, and the afternoon market moved slightly. There was a way to sell the goods. The Weihaiwei merchant group handled nearly 1,000 bags, so the market color was slightly softer. Except for the high-quality thick Japonica rice, which was already fixed, the remaining medium-quality rice was slightly lower than the late rice price by a few cents. Each variety of "Du Jian" and "Yin Bian Yuan" and other varieties did not have much honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, although the sources of goods from each road in Hexia were not strong, about 10-odd, although sellers were lowering prices to sell the goods on the market, few people asked about them. The market price of white Japonica rice was slightly lower by about 20 cents, and the price of early thin rice was slightly lower by more than 10 cents. The rest were also slightly lower by nearly a foot.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Arrives Continuously</p>
<p>Customer Indica Rice Falls Sharply by 20 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was already in a fatigued and stable situation. Because after a continuous small step down, the owners of the goods were unwilling to sell at a loss again, and new transactions have stopped registering. Returning futures contracts are not for sale. The market seems to be temporarily stable. However, the goods arriving continuously in recent days are very strong. In the past week, 378,000 bags of Saigon, Burmese, and Siamese rice have arrived, and another two ships arrived yesterday. More will continue to arrive in Shanghai today and tomorrow, so industry sentiment cannot avoid being small because of the two sufficient stocks. Yesterday's trading was flat. More than 6,000 bags were sold by this street throughout the day. Due to inconvenient transportation, only 2,500 bags went inland. 200 bags of foreign rice went to Tianjin. Customer Indica rice has been defending for many days and was finally crushed by foreign rice. Yesterday, this street sold 191 bags of milled oil rice, and the price was close to 20 cents lower.</p>
<p>Wheat Bran After Foreign Merchant Movement</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat bran market, after the foreign merchant movement, the market atmosphere has turned stable, especially for distant month goods. Currently, March goods are being quoted at 2.75 yuan, and April goods are being quoted at 2.8 yuan. In the future, if production increases, it will not be too expensive.</p>

<p>Tung Oil from Wuhan Soars</p>
<p>Tung oil in the Wuhan foreign merchant market has been quite silent for the past half month. Because there have been no large-scale transactions, there has been little development. However, last night, a telegram was suddenly received from Wuhan stating that the foreign firms had started trading at 32 yuan per load. However, the telegram was brief and did not specify the reason for the increase. Presumably, there is a large outlet for foreign firms, so they have sharply increased by about 2 yuan. Demand is greater than supply. From this, it can be seen that Zhejiang tung oil is already higher than Wuhan tung oil. Now that Wuhan tung oil has risen, it is feared that it will also want to respond to the news. Details will only be known after the letter arrives, and further updates will be posted.</p>

<p>Foreign Firms Tea Market Plunges</p>
<p>Recently, the foreign firms tea market has become increasingly quiet. Recently, British firms such as Jinlong and Xiehe have sent many telegrams regarding "Zhen Mei" green tea because Chinese merchants have lowered prices to seek sales. However, because foreign silver prices have soared and exchange rates have risen, no one has asked about it. The outlets for "Zhu Cha" and "Zhen Mei Xiu Mei" are also sluggish. Only "Gong Xi" green tea has had sporadic sales in Tianjin and Shandong shops in recent days. More than 700 boxes have been loaded this week, selling at 21-22 yuan to 24-25 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Dried &amp; Fresh Goods <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Raw Peanut Kernel Export Sales Are Stagnant</p>
<p>—Opening Prices Continue to Decline—</p>
<p>Recently, due to the decline in gold prices, export sales of raw peanut kernels to foreign firms have been stagnant, causing the opening prices in the Shanghai market to decline in each session. The market has not yet stabilized. Prices have fallen by more than 12 yuan before and after. Yesterday, a batch of "Kaifeng" raw peanut kernels was offered, with a price of 7.35 yuan. The remaining ordinary goods from various roads were less than 6 yuan. It seems that there is no sign of a turnaround in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Sugar Market <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Coarse Sugar White Sugar Plunges by 40 Cents</p>
<p>—Transaction of 1,892 Bags—</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw "Customs Gold" fall to as low as 17.50, and the trend was weak. The downward trend remained strong. The Guangdong Coarse Sand White Sugar Industry Cooperative Company sold 1,892 bags at a price of 16.6 yuan, a sharp drop of 40 cents compared to the previous day. All of them were sold clear. Another batch of "He Er Si" coarse white transfer cargo from the Customs station was sold at a price of 4.85 yuan, a drop of 5 cents. 300 bags were transacted. The guild only allocated dozens of bags of "He Chi" at 13.2 yuan. There was also a small number of transactions for Taikoo Sugar B grade at a price of 17.95 yuan, also down by 10 cents. The Zhen Yu No. 1 refined white sugar from this factory was 16.6 yuan, No. 2 was 50 cents, No. 3 was 35 cents, and No. 4 was 20 cents, a decrease of 10 cents. According to a telegram from an outside number, the "Shan Hui" large contraction in "Chao Qing" is not confirmed, so more than 700 bags have been offered again. The quoted price for "Ti Qing" was 10.6 yuan, "Huang Gang Qing" was 10.3 yuan, and "Long Qing" was 9.45 yuan, with no increase or decrease. However, a certain number definitely had a telegram of Shan Hui price decline the day before yesterday, so last night, another telegram was sent to inquire about the details, and a reply should be seen today.</p>
<p>Correction (The character "bag" in the 200-odd bags of "Chao Qing" traded in yesterday's sugar market report was mistakenly written as "10,000". It should be corrected.)</p>

<p>— (Yan BOGUANG)</p>
<p>Every spring, I always hear people in society talking about promoting new plans, how to save money, and thinking of ways to increase income and reduce expenditure. Time flies, and after the spring season has passed, they are still wasting money. At the end of the year, it's still a mess! Perhaps this is because people in society are implementing the plan of "the whole year's plan lies in spring"?</p>
<p>People who hesitate when encountering things often like to seek divination, ask for fortunes, measure words, and fortune-telling to point out the lost path. These people are really the biggest fools in the world, because if he can point out your maze, can't he point out his own?</p>
<p>In these few days, rich people are still having lavish spring wine parties, and they are very busy socializing. Poor families don't even have tree bark and grass roots to eat, and starve to death! It is precisely the silhouette of "Behind the red doors, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death!"</p>
<h3 id="e201">Lanterns Down Talk <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— ZHANG Huang</p>
<p>According to the old custom, the 24th day of the first month is the Lantern Festival. On this day, everyone, big and small, must make tangyuan to eat, called "Lantern dumplings". Temples in various places have been erecting tower lanterns in front of them since the Lantern Festival. Some only light them for three days, but most of them, with sufficient funds, will light them continuously until this day before they are closed. At that time, the public must express a small commemoration of the date when this prayer for a good harvest and respect for the gods ended successfully—made dumplings and gathered with their families to eat, and they also sent them to relatives and friends and neighbors. In fact, isn't it just using a false name to satisfy the appetite—do you want the abdomen to appear abundant?</p>
<p>However, the scenery of the New Year has reached the end of its strength on the 24th day of the first month and cannot be missed; the public's atmosphere of revelry, following the fall of the lights, is also extinguished in the same way, and will never be allowed to be erected and lit again!</p>
<p>Nowadays, a group of people who know a little English and like to make Chinese-foreign combined language often embed "falling lights" (an English word) into their native language and say, "For example: 'His appearance is really "falling lights"!' means that this person's appearance is too bad. The meaning of this English word "falling lights" is similar to falling behind, and mixing it into the native language is full of Europeanization (?) glory. Or, let's force a metaphor for this word, as a metaphor that when the lamp falls, not only does it lose its brilliance, but it is also not suitable for the times.</p>
<p>The lanterns are down, the days of joy are over, but the courage of people to step up their business and work after the Lantern Festival should be like the lights on the top of the tower, towering high in the sky, shining brightly, and don't fall down soon and willingly join the ranks of "falling lights"! May everyone remember to encourage themselves with falling lights!</p>
<h3 id="e202">A Boat on a Snowy Night <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— QING Qu</p>
<p>"Snow" was originally an auspicious sign of a good harvest, but the prognosticators say: If it snows in December, then the two wheat crops in the coming spring will be ripe; therefore, there is a saying: "December snow is like a quilt, spring snow is like a ghost," and also called "If you want wheat, see three white," meaning that getting snow three times is what farmers hope for most; Alas! Unexpectedly, God did not send snow in December, but it snowed several times in the spring. It is the same snow, but people's feelings about it are somewhat different.</p>
<p>One day, Qu Qu and his old friends, Lawyer Gu Mengfei, Huang Jun Tianbai, etc., went to the southwest countryside for business. If they went by waterway, it would be too much trouble: So, outside Ximen, they hired a small boat and a boatman named "Xixi" to go to the middle road; At this time, it was just the spring cold, and the six petals were flying. After not a few moments, it was like Baiyong Languan. Without saying to go back, the boat sailed, passing through many small bridges I do not know how many. The destination was still far away. Suddenly, I glanced at a bridge. Its area was as flat as water, like a boat could not pass through it. Hey! As we got closer, we slowly went away.</p>
<p>Huang Jun Tianbai held a glass and drank and chanted, and Yu couldn't help but kneaded a sentence, "The snow presses the heart of the bridge, and the two banks are wide." Because at this moment, it was already dusk, but it was all white, so the riverside was really inseparable from the earth, which was very beautiful; Yu asked Tianbai to write a couplet, and Tianbai continued the next sentence, "The wind blows the stern of the boat, a pot of spring." Everyone floated a big white; Later, Mengfei didn't speak for a while, and suddenly shouted, "Got it," saying: The word "blow" in the wind "blow" feels very inappropriate, and it should be changed to a word "return". The wind turns back, so that the wine will not be cold and lose its warmth, so it is appropriate to the word "spring". We both admire his iron-like skills, and the poetic rhythm is better than the law. We drank with a roar, and after a while, that country friend had been waiting in front of the house for a long time, and held hands to go up.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Failing to Compliment, Begging for Help, Being Scolded, Failing to Return, Following the Guest, Exaggerated</p>
<p>Although he was poor, he always had the experience of sitting in a chair, so he sat very carelessly, but he didn't expect that after sitting down, he seemed to feel that the seat board of the guest chair sank down with his butt, probably because he sat too hard, so he broke the chair. He was so scared that he held the table along and immediately sat up. Looking back, he gained a bit of knowledge. It turned out that the seat of the chair was not a wooden board, but a leaky net woven of rattan silk. In Gansu, he always sits on a soil pit. It is amazing to be able to find two or three square stools to sit on at someone else's house. This Little Western Paradise is really testing people. Guests are not allowed to be wronged by their butts when sitting on chairs, and they have come up with tricks to make people enjoy it. Thinking in his heart, showing a hesitant attitude, it was very ugly. Jia Duocai smiled and said: Your small feet, why are you still being polite with us? Just sit down. Mr. Hu put his hands behind his back and stretched down, groping for a while at the rattan net surface of the chair, and then slowly and lightly sat down. Jia Duocai sat far diagonally opposite him, looked at him, and then looked at Yueying standing on the corner of the table, thinking in his heart, I didn't expect such a mother to give birth to this wonderful daughter, is it strange? That time, Yueying sat here, and Jia Duocai couldn't bear to look at her, but today he looked at her like this again. But he also wanted to break it. If he didn't let people like him, how could he hope for help? This man surnamed Jia, as long as he met him, would stare at him with his eyes, that is to say, he had a bit of liking for him. As long as he was willing to want him, let him watch it for a while. What's the use of being shy? Eating and dressing are the most important things. Thinking like this, he didn't know how to be shy, just lowered his head slightly, and stood firmly with his hands on the table. Jia Duocai saw that although he held his face, it was still red in the white, which clearly meant that he was still quite embarrassed, which added to his charm. (144)</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess DE LING, Translated by QIN Shouou</p>
<p>My heart to return was simply more eager than everyone else's. Although I had already gotten on the train, I was still holding a handful of cold sweat, fearing that some unexpected event would happen in these last few minutes, preventing us from escaping. But people's psychology is often very contradictory: Although I was worried and anxious on the one hand, on the other hand, I was firmly leaning against the car window, looking backwards as much as possible, hoping that something would really happen.</p>
<p>"Hey! Deling! The train is about to leave! You can't look behind anymore! It's very unlucky!" The Empress Dowager saw that I was looking too mesmerized, and she became unhappy in her heart, so she shouted at me very sternly. Of course, I didn't dare to ask her why it was unlucky to look back: I had to immediately turn my head and stand upright.</p>
<p>Just like when we came, the whistle didn't blow, and the alarm clock didn't ring. Our special train quietly rolled. Two or three hours before it started to roll, all other trains on the entire Beijing-Fengtian line were prohibited from moving; Local officials from all over had also sent people to carefully guard both sides of the track; Everything was the same as when we came. The only difference was the speed of the train. When we came, the Empress Dowager desperately ordered us to go slowly, as if the slower the better: Now, she wants it to go as fast as possible. However, even though the old man ordered this, the driver did not dare to drive at full speed and speed; Because when we set off, they had been warned very severely that there must be no violent vibrations when the car was running, and if the train was to run fast, vibration was absolutely inevitable. Therefore, in order to achieve both goals, the driver had to drive the train faster than when it came and slower than the usual passenger car. This way, it was fast, and the vibration was not very violent! Watching the trees and fields outside the car window retreat backwards like a revolving lantern, we knew that our train was indeed running much faster than before. (255)</p>

<p>Furthermore, Yi Yun had heard some anecdotes about him, more moving than the various romantic histories circulating about Sai Jinhua. Therefore, he was exceedingly fond of this photograph. He brought it home and hid it in his study. Whenever he sat in his study, bothered beyond relief by the noise from the old woman next door, he would take out and admire this extremely lovely photograph, using it as his only means of dispelling the annoyance.</p>
<p>One day, this photograph was discovered by Yi Yun's younger sister, Kezhen. She happily took it to the Yu family's parlor to show the old woman, asking if the person in the photograph was pretty. The old woman took one look and suddenly exclaimed to Kezhen, asking where this photograph came from. Kezhen said her brother bought it from a street stall. The old woman then told Kezhen that the person in the photograph was herself, remembering it was taken when she was nineteen at a photo studio on the road outside the city. This photograph was likely a reprint from that studio. However, she did not reveal that at nineteen, she was a famous courtesan in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Yi Yun, sitting in his study next door, heard everything the old woman said very clearly. But he never imagined that this extremely detestable old woman was actually the incarnation of Peihong, the famous beauty of the Wu Palace, whom he considered extremely lovely. Even now, when he thinks about this, he still feels confused and can no longer distinguish whether the person in the photograph is lovely, or whether the old woman of the Yu family is truly detestable.</p>
<p>Advertisement: To Mr. Liang Boxin of Nanjing, Greetings. I am aware that you have developed hemoptysis due to excessive worry and have asked me to publish a notice seeking effective remedies. However, this matter is likely to lead to many abuses, and I dare not comply. Regarding your inquiry about the Yijin herb, I am not very clear. However, the wife of my colleague, Mr. Huang Jiping, suffered from hemoptysis last year and used this medicine, which she said was very effective. You might as well give it a try. Its distribution location is the Peisheng Pharmaceutical Company in Rendeli, Zhaozhou Road, outside the West Gate of Shanghai. This is specifically communicated to you, Yours sincerely, Ju Jingqi.</p>
<p>Local Customs Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Fierce Generals' Society of Dongshan <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>In every village in Dongshan, one can see a Fierce Generals' Hall, with a plaque hanging high above the entrance, inscribed with the five golden characters "Upper Heaven King's Palace." If we were to tally all of Dongshan, there would be no more than twenty Fierce Generals Liu, but there are over sixty Fierce Generals' Halls. Because the villages are relatively large, one society would split into East Village and West Village, each building its own hall. When it is their turn to host the society, they carry Fierce General Liu to their own hall. That is why there are so many Fierce Generals' Halls.</p>
<p>The villagers' purpose in worshiping Fierce General Liu is generally to hope for a good silkworm harvest in their village, to pray for rain during droughts, and to carry Fierce General Liu out to drive away insects during insect plagues, which would immediately stop the infestation.</p>
<p>Every year during the old lunar New Year, the usually deserted Fierce Generals' Hall presents a lively scene, with lanterns and candles shining day and night, and incense burning vigorously. Even those who usually sit in small teahouses all day will squeeze into the Fierce Generals' Hall to join the excitement, only closing the doors again after thanking the general on the fifteenth day of the first month.</p>
<p>A full mountain circuit is a major event held by every society. Carrying the Fierce General Liu, who weighs several hundred pounds, they must pass through many high mountains and villages, with gongs beating in front and flags and umbrellas following. As they approach a village, the Fierce Generals' Hall in front of them sets up incense tables to welcome them, and they must spin around a few times on the threshing ground, signifying that they have paid their respects for the New Year. The members of the society can then rest and eat some soy beans boiled in soy sauce, pickles, tea, and so on.</p>
<p>On the ninth day of the first lunar month, there is a very dangerous competition to seize the society, which is a general gathering of the small Fierce Generals from various villages in the front mountains. Two tiger flags, marking the boundary line, are planted on the Tangzi Ridge in Chawan Village. The small Fierce Generals must line up according to their arrival time along the flag line. Around noon, the large yellow flag propped up against the big elm tree is shouldered by a strong man and run down the ridge as if flying, followed by each small sedan chair, twisting and turning down the ridge in a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>It is said that whichever village seizes the lead has a twelve-point certainty of a good silkworm harvest. But in their life-or-death struggle, some lose their shoes and socks, some fall and break their heads, and they often grab a handful of mud from the ground to apply to their wounds and continue the procession.</p>
<p>The customs of the Fierce Generals' Society in Dongshan are all, in a word, to pray that no famine will befall them. But in recent years, which village in Dongshan is not suffering from famine, and which villagers are not living in hunger? If Fierce General Liu could protect them, perhaps such a situation would not exist.</p>

<p>The Chinese are truly blessed. Foreign scientists, delving into their hearts and racking their brains, invent things one by one from scientific laboratories, such as electric lights, cars, airplanes, and movies, for our wealthy people to enjoy and utilize. It is unknown how many lifetimes of virtue the Chinese have cultivated to deserve such blessings.</p>
<p>When X-rays were first invented, I had an idea: if X-rays could be made into glasses and used for gambling, whether dice or mahjong tiles, everything could be seen through, giving one a monopoly on winning. Unfortunately, foreign scientists did not consider the needs of our Chinese people and did not invent such a thing. The Chinese, only knowing how to use but not invent, can only harbor such ideas, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>According to a Paris dispatch on the 24th, Auguste, a renowned physicist in his late seventies and one of the original inventors of film, has recently invented "magic glasses" that will greatly revolutionize movies. Auguste has found two colors from fifteen hundred colors, and used these to make glasses that allows the wearer to see real physical things when looking at a photograph, with the sensation of a subject matter. If you wear these two-color glasses to watch a movie, there is no difference from seeing real events. If there is a scene of a train speeding by in the movie, it will seem as if it is about to jump out of the screen and come straight at the viewer.</p>
<p>If these glasses arrive in Shanghai, business will surely flourish, and buyers will surely be enthusiastic. Because the Chinese are truly and deeply obsessed with movies. Even without these glasses, they watch until their eyes are blurred and their heads are dizzy, but they don't mind. If these glasses were available, no matter how expensive they were, even if it meant pawning their foot bindings, they would buy a pair of bifocals to wear. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>I think these "magic glasses" still have some shortcomings. Their scope is too narrow, because these glasses only work when watching movies. If you use them to look at other things, they won't have any effect. I want to modify these glasses. If you could wear these glasses and see through the bizarre and erratic social conditions, the superficial and hypocritical psychology of the people, and the complex and ever-changing diplomatic policies of various countries, then these glasses would definitely be more valuable.</p>
<p>Or, even better, invent glasses that can transform anything. For example, if there is an ugly woman, she could wear the glasses and become a stunning beauty. If there is a heartbreaking event, wearing the glasses could turn it into a satisfying and gratifying one. Or, if there is an irreconcilable enemy, wearing the glasses could make them as close as brothers. I think if such glasses were invented, they would surely be even more profitable and widely welcomed.</p>

<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes from Rural Living (Part 2)</p>
<p>I slept soundly and woke up when the golden sunlight was peeking into the room. In the hall next door, the old lady was chanting Buddhist scriptures in a low voice. The murmuring sound seemed like rhythmic music. In the tranquil morning air, I understood and was reluctant to leave the warm bed, like a lover's whisper. My friend's study had four south-facing glass windows, and the sun gently crept to the center of the bed. I looked up to welcome this warmth, almost being lured back into a sweet slumber by the musical Buddhist chanting.</p>
<p>"Grandma, hasn't the Shanghai uncle gotten up yet?"</p>
<p>The seven-year-old child called out in the courtyard, so innocently. I wondered if he was surprised to see me get up late, or if he was not having enough fun playing alone and was thinking of me, his childlike uncle. His grandmother immediately stopped chanting and seemed to leave the sandalwood altar with burning candles to walk towards her grandson, forbidding him to speak in such a low voice. I jumped out of bed and they were peeking at me through the window.</p>
<p>The old lady first told her grandson to come in, and then said from outside the door, "You're disturbing your uncle's sleep. Children are so inconsiderate!"</p>
<p>"No, I woke up a while ago and was reading a few pages in bed." I lied, gently patting the child's head and asking, "Are you playing outside?"</p>
<p>"Really? Saying a child - I woke you up by chanting…"</p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all!" I said quickly and met her to go outside.</p>
<p>"Country people wake up early and have nothing to do, so they chant scriptures as a pastime, and now it's become a habit. Yunxun—my friend—always says I'm superstitious, but I just chant casually. How can the Bodhisattva care about such things?" she explained.</p>
<p>Huang Ma brought in a basin of water from the kitchen and interjected, "Madam even wants to cultivate a granddaughter!"</p>
<p>The madam did not object, a satisfied smile revealing her kind corner of her mouth. As if something had been said that she felt right in her heart, she went along with it and said, "The young master's breakfast is all prepared, and it will be moved to the study in a while."</p>
<p>A mother's love stirred in my memory. When I was a child, I lost my biological parents and grew up at my sister and her husband's house, and did not have a brilliant childhood and did not know of the greatness of a mother's love. I used my own physical strength to support myself, and my life was simply fish on the chopping block. How could I ask for some warm, maternal love?</p>
<p>Breakfast was rich, all country dishes that could be stored for a long time. It was probably specially prepared for a respected guest, right? It was still early, and I wanted to take a walk nearby, but the child came to pull me to the orchard behind the house.</p>
<p>Behind Jishantang, after passing through a side alley, there was his family's kitchen, which was also a row of three rooms. Going out through the small door on the left, was a large orchard that combined a vegetable garden and a flower garden. Vegetables were planted nearby. Huang Ma told me that they could not finish eating these few vegetable beds even in the winter.</p>
<p>Stepping on the moist clay, we stood under a plum tree. The tree was in full bloom with dignified pale white flowers. The aroma of these flowerballs wafted to my nose and involuntarily opened up both hands and took a deep breath. The doctor had advised me to have such an open space for my recuperation. Thank God for giving me this beautiful place.</p>
<p>The garden was surrounded by a row of low walls, as if touring famous scenic spots. At the corner of the wall were a dozen peach trees, not yet in bloom, already coquettishly shaking their waists. Allow me to live through this spring, I pray to Heaven.</p>
<p>The child was much happier with a companion and jumped around happily, telling many innocent stories, until his grandmother called him to study.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Quarrying <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>The sky had barely brightened when wisps of smoke were already rising from the rooftops of houses in the vicinity of Gushan and Guishan.</p>
<p>Jinlin's wife at Xiaoyao Palace got up earlier than anyone else today. When she got out of bed, it was still dark outside, and she had to light the kerosene lamp to do things.</p>
<p>"Debao's father! Get up! The rice is cooked." She called to Jinlin, who was sleeping like a dead pig in bed, but was afraid of waking the child who was only one year old in the corner of the bed! Debao! So she called out in a very low voice. However, Jinlin carried a heavy iron hammer all day long, desperately working in the stone shoal, and his body was indeed somewhat unsustainable. Especially at night, he just wanted to use this sleep to make up for the energy he lost; therefore, his wife pushed and called him several times, but he still did not move at all, and still slept soundly.</p>
<p>"It's dawn! Everyone has eaten their mountain-going meal and gone to the mine; if you don't get up, the first turn in your own mine has to be opened early, loaded up and sold..." She was impatient with shouting and mumbled, importantly pinching his nose, "Get up!"</p>
<p>"Ugh! Is it dawn? I'm so tired! My bones feel like they're split apart!" He turned over when his wife pinched his nose, felt the aching bones, but finally struggled to get up.</p>
<p>"The sun is three feet high! Uncle Agou, Grandpa Huangmao, they have all gone up the mountain; tired, who doesn't know what tired is! It's all for the three meals and a bowl of rice!"</p>
<p>"Oh! They've already gone!" He quickly washed his face, sat down at the broken plank table, and gulped down two large bowls of rice in a few bites, and rushed to the mountain with his iron hammer and iron rod. When he arrived at the mine, he saw that Changsheng, Jinhua, Aquan, Maogou, Fulin, and others who worked in rotation with him had arrived before him, and they were sitting on the rocks puffing on their pipes.</p>
<p>"You guys have already come!" Jinlin stepped forward, put the iron hammer and iron rod on his shoulder on the ground, took a breath and said.</p>
<p>"We're here! Are we going to start by working on the surface today, or are we going to mine the turn first?" Everyone asked him as usual.</p>
<p>"I think we should mine the turn first! Anyway, there's no way out on the surface." Jinlin put one foot on a stone, pondered for a while, and pointed to a stone peak of four or five thousand tons and said to them.</p>
<p>"Alas! If this turn of white stone were ten years ago, I'm afraid it would be worth no less than two hundred dollars. I remember that at that time, several women on the surface even wore gold rings so that they couldn't even bend their fingers. Those who owned mines, supported stone boats, and mined mountains, which one didn't eat big fish and meat every day, wearing fur and silk? When gambling started during the New Year, the stakes were easily talked about in thousands or hundreds. Alas! Now, it’s almost impossible to fill our stomachs. It’s hard to believe!" A-Da indeed felt a lot of emotion about the differences between the past and now, so he complained about the turn.</p>
<p>"Hey! Now this job is too crowded, how can it be compared with the past? Now even with the goods, we are still worried that we can't sell them! Sometimes we can't even make enough for our labor costs!" Jinlin couldn't help but feel a little sad!</p>
<p>They smoked for a while, as if gathering all the energy in their bodies by the power of the smoke, everyone shook off their spirits, took the tools they should use, and walked up the rock.</p>
<p>"Umph! Ah ha! Oh yo!" Everyone's strength was concentrated on the iron hammer and iron rod, and everyone's spirit was used on this majestic and great call.</p>
<p>Bang - bang - bang - stone chips flew into the sky, and stone fragments jumped to the distance. Muscles swelled inside their bodies, and sweat dripped on their bodies!</p>
<p>"Umph! Ah ha! Oh yo!" Everyone was screaming! Screaming…</p>
<p>The entire valley was shaken!</p>
<p>Note - A "turn" is a stone mountain. After it is mined, it must be tied with rotating wood to drag it down the mountain. A "surface" is a rock on a hill or ground surface. The people moving it can be 2, 4, or even over 10 people, meaning that it can be carried. A "shasha pian" (煞片) is a stone fragment weighing fifty or sixty catties.</p>
<p>Mom! Isn't there food to eat here?</p>
<p>— Yu Yan</p>
<h3 id="e211">Child Bride <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm not going! I'm definitely not going!" the girl said, agitated, the muscles on her face etched into wrinkles by extreme discomfort, her body falling into her mother's arms. "I can't stand my mother-in-law's (note: the husband's mother) beatings. When my mother-in-law beats people, she has no sense of proportion, and it's always a beating with a wooden stick! Mom, look at me... this whole body..." The girl took off her top, revealing stripes of red and purple crisscrossing her back. The extreme wounds, seen in the eyes of onlookers, would move anyone to tears.</p>
<p>"Good child, listen to your mother and go! Your mother has no choice, and cannot bear to leave you! If not for being unable to feed... you..." the mother said, becoming more and more anxious and uncomfortable. She felt very guilty, clearly seeing the welts on her daughter's body, clearly knowing that the girl could not bear it, but she herself was telling her daughter to go back obediently. Wasn't she herself announcing her daughter's death sentence? "Good child, I will definitely try to bring you back next year, as long as the fields aren't as bad as they are this year, if there's any way at all," the mother comforted.</p>
<p>"No, I won't! I definitely won't go back! You said last year that you would bring me back when there was a harvest, but it's still not happened..."</p>
<p>"Good child, don't blame your mother. Your mother only gave you to others to be a young bride because there was no food at home!"</p>
<p>"No food to eat? But my younger brother has food to eat!" The girl said somewhat angrily.</p>
<p>"Good child, how can you say such a thing? Saying it this way, it seems like your mother is biased!" the mother explained gently, "You girls can't compare to boys! Boys are for carrying on the family line! How did your father tell me when he passed away? He wanted me to teach and raise your brother well, and to keep your brother with me even if I had to eat grass roots and tree bark. The Wang family's incense depends entirely on your brother alone!"</p>
<p>"..." The girl had no words to say, perhaps tacitly acknowledging that her mother's words were correct?</p>
<p>A twelve-year-old girl should be innocent and lively as a matter of course; but for some reason, she has a very old heart! Perhaps it was the extreme suffering and inhuman life that has aged her like this!</p>
<p>At night, the moonlight was like water, and all sounds were silent. This should be good poetic material for poets, but our girl was bound by terrifying memories.</p>
<p>It was a misty autumn morning, the fog so thick that you could barely see your fingers in front of you, but the twelve-year-old child bride groped her way to the edges of her own fields to pull weeds from the soybean seedlings.</p>
<p>The fog did not dissipate until two hours after breakfast. She was about to rest after a morning of hard work.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had been squatting on the ground for too long. She suddenly stood up, and her foot twisted, crushing a soybean seedling, though she herself did not realize it.</p>
<p>"You low-life bitch, a belly full of bad ideas! When you saw that I told you to pull weeds, you deliberately crushed the soybean seedlings! See if I don't beat you to death!" This sudden sound really startled her too much! She was as afraid as a mouse hearing a cat meow, her whole body trembling. Then, a wooden stick fell on her head, back, and feet...</p>
<p>It is unknown when that fierce beating stopped, because she fainted before twenty blows.</p>
<p>It was already two o'clock after midnight! Less than a few hours before dawn; after dawn, she would have to go to her mother-in-law's house. The old wounds from the past two days still hurt on her body, and perhaps in a few days, new pains would come to replace the slightly faded old pains! She dared not think, but had to think.</p>
<p>The face of her mother-in-law seemed to float in the darkness: those thick eyebrows, the wide mouth with hideous yellow teeth, the fleshy face, that ghost-like shriek...</p>
<p>"Dead ghost, you're only back today! Why didn't you die</p>

<p>at your mother's house!" She guessed that her mother-in-law's opening words upon seeing her would be like this.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Scenery of the South <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yuanding</p>
<p>Water is a Genius</p>
<p>In geography books, the so-called "floating market streets" of Wuzhou in the South are highlighted as a characteristic. In fact, these things do not hold special meaning to people from Wuzhou, perhaps because of "familiarity." However, there is another kind of miracle that people from Wuzhou may not be aware of. However, I think this should be the best scenery in the South.</p>
<p>On the right bank of the Tan River, stands White Crane Mountain. The hilltop is Hebin Park, with pine forests, palm trees, and sun-shading banyan trees. No matter how hot and humid the summer is, it is always a cool world there.</p>
<p>When we stand in the shade of the trees and gaze, we can see that Wuzhou is surrounded on three sides by the Li River and the West River. The two rivers converge in front of us, and the people of Wuzhou have given it a special name, called the "Mandarin Duck River."</p>
<p>Because the Li River is emerald green and the West River is yellow and turbid, after the two bodies of water converge, they exchange and become a beautiful picture. Because of the distance, one cannot see the flow of water, and the river surface becomes a still eddy. If you appreciate it carefully, you will recognize many cartoons. In the yellow and turbid water, a touch of green is mixed in, or green surrounds a band of yellow, often forming dissolving, elongated women's hair, or a range of distant mountains, and other various images, which are very rich in symbolic poetry. Compared with the fleeting, stagnant cloud shadows in the sky, it is even more lively.</p>
<p>If you admit that clouds are geniuses, then you should also admit that water is a genius.</p>
<p>News: The Bubble Society is an organization formed by young people who love literature and art. Its purpose is to connect feelings, exchange knowledge, study literature and art, and increase public interest in literature and art. Members are divided into basic and ordinary types.

<p>Zhonghua (1140) 9:00 PM to 9:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Lament of a Courtesan"</p>
<p>In the gentle and clear fourth month, the rain has just cleared, the courtyard is desolate and I am heartbroken. From ancient times, people's feelings have been cold and warm, and the glamour of courtesans is only temporary. Before I was a woman, I moved people's hearts, holding hands and touching feet, and words of affection came from the mouth. At fifteen or sixteen, the flower is just blooming, like the moon at Mid-Autumn Festival, exceptionally bright. At seventeen or eighteen, everyone loves me, like a lotus emerging from the water, fragrant and fresh. At twenty, it is the height of spring, and the oriole shuttles and the sparrow is trained. There are many carriages and horses in front of the door, and the old madam is like a pearl in the palm. Morning is cold and night is clear, and romantic young men come like clouds. Outside the door, a prince is about to mount his horse, and it is reported that a young master is coming soon. We are close and happy with each other, and there is no end to the false warmth. But now the flower is withered and the moon has set, and I am no longer as moving as I was in the past. There are only a few lonely carriages and horses in front of the door, and the pearl in the palm has turned to dust. There is no shadow of anyone on the Cold Food Festival and Qingming Festival, and the romantic young men are nowhere to be seen. Where have the dissolute young men gone? The elegant young masters do not come to the door. Who will love her, and what false warmth is left? Thinking about it makes me very sad.</p>
<p>Yao Xiao'an Wang Pingqiu Qilin Leopard</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 11:00 PM to 12:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "By the West Lake"</p>
<p>Hangzhou is known for its tranquility and elegance. The setting sun shines on the West Lake. Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty once camped here, and nine emperors made it their capital, known as the king. The scenery is indeed secluded and beautiful, and the scenery is pleasant everywhere. Don't you see the clear mountains and rivers where crows and magpies are chattering? Feilai Peak faces Taoguang. Admire the three peaks of Tianzhu. The majestic and majestic Ten Thousand Buddhas are hidden. The Three Pools Mirroring the Moon have become classics. Willow catkins fly on the Bai Su Causeway. Everyone stops here when they see the whip, in order to see the scenery of the lakes and mountains. It is true that Xizi did not live in vain in this life, and because of the name of the sparrow, it will be famous forever. He should laugh happily in the Nine Springs, and the eternal regrets will be relieved. It's a pity that the beggar Zixu became a dream, and the King of Wu cried for him at the platform. It's a pity that he cut off his head with his white hair, leaving behind a hatred that hurts his teeth for thousands of years. Therefore, every time autumn comes, he takes revenge, and the tide surges towards Qiantang. His heart is angry because of Xishi's plan, and he died innocently, losing his life. This led to the loss of Jiangshan Wu Yue, and the regret of thousands of years is long. Although Xizi sailed away in a boat, he returned to the mountains and hid his shadow. Doctor Wu was so angry that his hair stood on end, so he surged and showed his madness. It has been passed down to this day for thousands of years, and it is regarded as a strange and beautiful sight. Who knows the loyal guests of the past? Dan Chen's great spirit reported to the King of Wu. A burst of anger is Shiqiantang.</p>

<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>Last year (1934) in September, when "Tarzan and His Mate" premiered in this city and broke the premiere record for Western films, Tarzan's name had already been deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary movie fans.</p>
<p>The production of Tarzan films began nineteen years ago—in 1916, the first Tarzan film was released to the world—and up to the recent "Tarzan and His Mate," it has been brought to the screen twelve times. Because each Tarzan film can make a profit, especially "Tarzan the Ape Man" and "Tarzan and His Mate," and the latter was selected as one of the top ten films of last year, MGM recently bought the thirteenth Tarzan script from the original author, preparing to make another Tarzan beast film this year. Of course, the male and female leads will be Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan, whom movie fans are eager to see.</p>
<p>Tarzan is not only famous in the film industry, but in the American wireless broadcasting industry, Tarzan has become a drama adopted by various broadcasting stations; he is also a common pen comic seen by countless newspaper readers, as well as a trademark for dozens of daily necessities such as chewing gum, garters, and plastic toys. Whatever author, they would all be willing to be the owner of Tarzan. Tarzan will certainly bring fame and fortune to his owner, but who else can enjoy these rights besides the original author, Edgar Rice Burroughs?</p>
<p>Burroughs was not originally an author. Before 1912, he was a cavalryman, a railway inspector, a gold digger, a salesman of proprietary medicines, and a consultant for store services. In 1910, Burroughs heard from a friend that the rewards for writers were very generous. So he began his writing career, selling articles to various magazines and newspapers for manuscript fees. In 1912, he first published his first Tarzan novel called "Tarzan of the Apes." In the silent film era, a film company adapted it into a film and renamed it "Tarzan the Mighty," starring the strongman Elmo Lincoln. This "Tarzan the Mighty" was one of the silent films that grossed over a million dollars. So Burroughs saw that his Tarzan novel was indeed popular, so he abandoned everything and decided to devote all his efforts to writing novels.</p>
<p>Ten years later, in 1922, Burroughs felt that his novel publishers were exploiting too much commission, so he organized the Burroughs Company to print and sell his own products himself. After Burroughs first succeeded in writing the Tarzan novel in 1913, fortunately he had some foresight and registered the name Tarzan with the Patent Office early on, and has since enjoyed the benefits of the patent steadily.</p>
<p>Burroughs is now almost sixty years old, but he looks like a strong man in his forties or fifties. He goes horseback riding and plays tennis in the suburbs every day. He learned to fly a plane a few months ago and now has his own private plane. He has a son who has inherited his father's business and manages all the administrative affairs of the Burroughs Company.</p>
<p>Although Burroughs' Tarzan is set in Africa, people who have read his novels all think that Burroughs must be very familiar with the customs and conditions of Africa. In fact, this writer who is famous for writing African novels has never been to Africa.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e219">Review of "The Band Plays On" <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Band Plays On</p>
<p>—Nanjing—</p>
<p>In the past, we have come into contact with many American sports films. At the same time, we have pointed out that those films, like the works with airplanes and rowing as themes, use ball games as the main theme. It is nothing more than making the film proceed in a tense atmosphere, so that the audience can obtain a stimulating effect, and there is no other significance. However, now the same type of work, "The Band Plays On," is a better one. This is not to say that its content is so substantial, but rather that it is quite successful in terms of production techniques.</p>
<p>Like every ordinary film, the story here is entrusted to fantasy, making four wandering children become four football stars. However, what is more characteristic is that the playwright writes the four of them very affectionately, and then constructs a love entanglement in the middle. Therefore, this film has a very good achievement in terms of emotional grasp.</p>
<p>The usual American films often have a kind of lively and enterprising youthful spirit, and what cannot be missing is also humor and comedy, which are naturally not missing here. These are organized with the tense atmosphere of the football field, which has already made us feel that the director can indeed do the job happily. However, these are not the characteristics of the film. What we have to point out is the tragedy of Katie's love between Tony and Stephen. When Tony accidentally sees Katie kissing Stephen, his pain, from the declaration of concession in the ward to taking the wrong road after leaving the ward, we have connected this scene with the scene where Stephen sends the leather suitcase to Katie and Katie scolds Tony after Stephen is injured. We are moved by it. In addition, the five of them are in the countryside, some playing chess, some playing leaf games, and lightly depicting Stephen and Katie's love and play, Tony's sentimental solitary walk, Katie chasing after him, those two scenes, whether it is the atmosphere or emotion, have very good achievements.</p>
<p>From these places, we can certainly see the success of the director. At the same time, the main actors, such as Stuart Erwin, who plays Stephen, and the reporter in "Viva Liberty" have the same personality. His excellent acting skills can be appreciated by anyone. Also, the heroine Betty Furness, who met for the first time, also performed very well. She is so full of emotion that she naturally and deeply depicts the personality of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>Others, such as Tony, did not have any achievements in previous films, but he also performed well here, which shows that the director Russell Mack has a very good grasp of the actors.</p>
<h3 id="e220">"Forsaking All Others" Co-Starring Three Big Stars <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>This is indeed a rare opportunity. "Forsaking All Others" co-starring Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, and Robert Montgomery, three big stars, will meet us at the Nanjing Grand Theater. This film has been recognized as one of MGM's best.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford plays the female lead. What a beloved star she is! Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery are also two very popular male stars. You can imagine how well "Forsaking All Others" will do with three people working together.</p>
<p>The magnificence of the scenery and the outstanding performance are all above the standard. In addition to the three big stars, the remaining supporting roles are also famous figures in the film industry. Director W. S. Van Dyke is one of the most famous directors in Hollywood today. Under his handling, this film will certainly be even more perfect.</p>
<p>The story is taken from a comedy depicting a scene of a love triangle. Gable and Joan have been lovers since childhood. On the eve of her return to New York from Spain, when they parted sadly on the park road, she also expressed her willingness to marry him, but he knew that Montgomery was his rival in love.</p>
<p>The next day, he received a telegram from Montgomery saying that he had married a girl. A year later, Joan, who was in love with Gable, suddenly fell in love with Montgomery. After a few weeks of Gable's pursuit, she finally agreed to drive with him to the countryside. Many interesting details are inserted into the scene where the car breaks down. All three protagonists perform to the best of their ability.</p>

<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Lulan Bels laughed; "That's not it. I came specifically to see you again." Ded asked strangely: "Have you seen me for thirty years, isn't that enough?" Lulan said: "I thought so... but... maybe I'm wrong... I often think to myself that a gambler must also be a bold and just person, willing to sacrifice everything in order to win a greater victory..." Ded interrupted: "Gambling is originally a profession, the same as other professions." Lulan Bels seemed to be touched and said: "But my uncle—Saradu Gabels—is different." Ded asked in surprise: "Your uncle!" Lulan Bels ignored him and continued to talk to himself; "I often saw him throwing six naturals in a row, but he always bet all of them, until he won completely, and I lost all my money."</p>
<p>Ded was surprised and opened his eyes wide when he heard this and said: "Hey, you talk like an expert." Lulan said sadly: "After suffering all the hardships, one can become a superior person. These things are experiences gained from being fooled. It is good to throw a natural, but it is icy cold to throw a pair of snake eyes." Ded exclaimed in surprise: "Holy Markrull!" Lulan continued to say endlessly: "So I want to see you again. I have always admired your gambling integrity, but I am very disappointed. You are just an iron horn, specializing in throwing copper coins."</p>
<p>Ded jumped up and said: "Listen up! I dare to gamble with you anytime, anywhere, no matter how big or small!" Lulan deliberately teased him and said: "Two hundred and fifty, all at once, okay?" Ded listened and froze for a moment and said: "That's too much." Lulan put on a disdainful look and said: "I thought you were a real gambler." Ded straightened his back and said: "Of course. How much money do you have, I will play with you." Lulan said: "Just two hundred and fifty yuan." Ded looked at her. She knew that her dice were reliable, so she agreed decisively. He stood up and laughed and said: "Miss Bels, this is what you wanted. Okay, let's go to the chance hall."</p>
<p>As he said that, he took the lead and walked towards the famous "back room." But when he reached the door, he stopped again and said: "No, I won't fall for your trick again. Your hands are too fast, and you want to grab things." Lulan said: "Clarence, I'm afraid that's not possible anymore. I conceded last time, what else is there to say? I just want some cash now so that I can go out. Like my uncle, I would rather bet the whole amount and win or lose all at once." Ded listened and seemed to feel that it was unbearable to win the old woman's money. However, this was a business that she had brought to his door, so how could he send the God of Wealth back? Besides, two hundred and fifty yuan is not a small amount. So he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>Ded entered the "back room" and went to open the drawer to take the dice. Lulan quickly opened her bag, took out a check, threw it on the table, and took out her two dice and asked politely: "Shall I be the dealer?" Ded was still searching for his special dice, but Lulan asked again: "Let me use my own dice... I'm used to it, and my luck is better...:" As she said that, her voice trembled. She then smiled, seeming rather pitiful. Ded thought that she might not win with one throw, so he agreed readily, and immediately took out a roll of banknotes and asked: "How much are you betting?"</p>
<p>Lulan said: "I'm betting the whole amount." She held the dice in her hand, shaking them near her ear like an expert, blowing a breath, and shouting: "Dice, be good... baby is going to buy a pair of shoes..." She moved her hand forward, and the two dice rolled out. She immediately shouted: "Holy Dijerti! A natural! Ride a good horse!" Ded had no choice, and a large part of the roll of banknotes had already been lost. He threw the rest on the table, and Lulan picked up the dice as before, shaking them near her ear, blowing a breath, and then shouting: "Dice! Get hot!" (To be continued)</p>
