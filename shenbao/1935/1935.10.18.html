<h3>英答覆法政府　地中海艦隊難撤　法如合作則商量　國聯制裁絕不鬆懈　英有封鎖意海岸說</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法總理賴伐爾提出英國將地中海艦隊撤退一部份之建議、英政府已答覆之、其大意聲明地中海之英艦隊仍有維持之必要、英内閣昨日開會議决對法建議婉詞拒絕、昨夜英國駐法大使卽將此覆文送達法總理、聞英大使向賴伐爾聲稱、如法國不予以相等之保護、則英政府不能考慮减少地中海英海軍力量事、雖昨夜晤談之眞正內容現尙未經披露、但衆料賴伐爾爲便利與墨索里尼談判起見、或許以法國艦隊爲英國後援、聞法總理曾向英大使探詢、如意國减少其駐利比亞之軍力、英國可否亦减少其地中海軍力、而恢復原有狀態、惟據此間消息靈敏者認法總理調和成功之希望、至爲微細、在昨夜英大使送達英政府覆文以前、賴伐爾曾接見意國駐法大使、據未證實之消息、意大使已將墨索里尼發來有建設性質之覆文送交法總理（十六路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）英國半官發言人頃向哈瓦斯社記奢發表談話略謂「英國爲事勢所迫、或將封鎖意大利海岸、蘇彝士運河、及紅海各海口、亦未可知、若然則僅係爲挽救國聯會之危亡、不得已而後出此、蓋實施封鎖、雖其性質並非軍事制裁、亦必引起若干軍略上之問題、倘欲封鎖意大利海岸、則必由英法兩國海軍全部合作而後可，故英國竭力欲避免之、今晨英國不管部大臣艾登向經濟制裁委員會提議、主張絕對禁止意國貨物入口、而不主張採取眞正之封銷、其故實由於此」云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）內閣今日開會曾詳細考慮意阿問題之全部形勢、並悉外相霍爾擬於十月廿二日在衆院演說、其演說稿亦經內閣核准、霍氏演說之時火槪將聲明、英國如不遇極端之挑釁、不　戰爭云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日自官塲方面得悉、英意雨國如發生衝突、英國原曾要求法國以海軍協助、現在對於英國船隻得使用法國港口一項、卽能滿意、英國以爲將來是否擁護國聯及對於歐洲問題之一般政策、當全視法國之答案爲轉移、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯之制裁行動今日繼續進行、惟此間外交家則咸注目於英法兩國之齟齬、九月中英國外相霍爾在國聯之演說今日已重新提起、以證明法國如過於袒意、而不能擁護英國集體保安制之主張、則英國準備自劃於歐洲太陸陸之外、此間今日相信、法國努力維持意國之親善、或將使英德兩國之關係益形鞏固、若英國一旦解除其對於集體保安制之積極領袖地位則國聯將僅餘軀壳而已、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）據與國聯接近各界之意見、法總理賴伐爾最近的或亦爲最後的竟取基礎調和意阿戰爭之企圖、恐不免遭遇失敗、故國聯進行組織對意制裁、毫無鬆懈之傾嚮、衆信縱墨索里尼以爲賴伐爾之建議可加接受、阿皇亦必拒絕之、蓋阿皇現將受國聯之擁護也、惟此間人士均不信墨索里尼將接受賴伐爾所提出之建議、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）總理兼外長賴伐爾於本日先後接見意國大使賽呂蒂、及英國大使克拉克、會談歷時頗久、官方對於談話內容雖取保留態度、然一般人相信賴伐爾現仍進行作和解之努力據一般人所得印象、英法意三國問之談判現似在停滯狀態中、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國堅決行動　羅馬大感不安　最後希望在敎廷居間</h3>
<p>（羅馬）政界要人因英國政府竭力主張嚴格施行制裁手段、頗爲不安、以爲和平解决最後希望、端在教廷方面、蓋以教廷現行政策、乃反對嚴厲制裁故也、此間官塲對於英國所採取之堅决政策、表示區驚異、以爲意國政策對於英國在東菲洲之利益、從未加以威脅、而英國所採堅决行動、謂由於尊重國聯會所致、亦殊不見充分、綠該國不管部大臣艾登前於本年五月間、聘問羅馬時、曾提出關於解决意阿爭端之建議、幷未主張須由國聯會參預其間也、據負責方面所知、最近教廷已由外交途徑、着手調解、其所採取之立塲、乃對於一切戰爭併意國對阿比西尼亞戰事在內、均加以反對、第對於嚴厲制裁手段、尤其是軍事制裁手段、因恐其掀起世界第二次戰爭尤所反對、因而教廷駐外各大使、最近多奉有訓令、分別進行調解工作云、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>英國揭底　實行抵制意貨　制裁股員會昨一致通過　互助股會考慮損失補償</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）經濟制裁股員會於今晨討論英國不管部大臣艾登所提出之建議案、主張禁止意國貨物入口、當經一致通過、英國代表團方面認爲此係央國之一大成功、蓋一則本日討論該案時、出席各國代表對於禁止意國貨物入口、實際上無一人表示反對、二則小恊商及巴爾幹協商各國、並未提出以滴當之損失補償、作爲參加經濟制裁之條伴實出當初意料之外、三則南美各國代表、如阿根廷及委内瑞拉、日前曾提出重要之保留、而於本日仍投票贊成該案、實亦爲初料所不及、又據哈瓦斯社記者探悉、各小國擁護國聯會盟約、確具熱誠、例如立陶宛代表駐法公使克里瑪期向本記者宣稱、謂立陶宛主張增加國聯會威權、較諸任何人爲尤甚、捷克代表團某要人則謂、「吾人抱有二重目的、一則必須尊重國聯會盟約、蓋盟約乃爲吾國獨立及安全之唯一保障、二則須顧及意大利與小協商各國之相互提携、免遭無可挽救之損害、凡經各國共同商定之各項措置、吾人自常完全加以贊助、但對於意闕、則須避免引起非必要之困難、則以意國爲歐洲穩定之一要素故也」云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）經濟制裁股員會、今晨討論原料品輸往意國問題時、當决定將禁運物品、列作兩種淸單、第一淸單包括鋼·羊毛·橡皮·機械各項、第二淸單包括煤·煤油·棉花·銅各項、此項淸單須俟該股員會查明非會員國態度之後、始可加以討論、該股員會旋于午後賡續開會、討論英國不管部大臣艾登所提出之建議、卽主張抵制意國輸出貨物者波蘭瑞士兩國代表當提出保留、波蘭代表科瑪爾尼凱所提出之保留、關於現行合同如何處置問題、倒如波蘭曾向意國　造船　、目下雖未完成、但已分部繳付造價、瑞士代表史德基、則反對英國代表團所提出之建議、所持理由、（一）爲匈奧兩國已採取反對態度、（二）抵補辦法、猶未確定、（三）瑞士國經濟具有特殊情形、經濟制裁股員會當决定指派小組委員會、研究各項特殊問題、例如波蘭所定購之船隻問題、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）今日國聯互助委員會開會時、羅馬尼亞外相　稱、英國所提出無論環境如何、無論互助與賠償之問題如何、决定對意制裁必須實施一節、羅國願贊助之云、十八人委員會通過法學家小糾委員會關於可否因憲法上困難而不實施或展緩實施制裁問題之報告書、法學家以爲國聯任何會員皆受盟約第十六條之束縛、各　會員國皆負有迅速設法實施制裁之責任、此項報告書宣讀後、阿眞廷代表卽撤消其前所提出之保留、十八人委員會又通過軍事小組委員會之報告書、將科學與引火戰術中所用之各種瓦斯器具列入禁品之列、上述兩種報告書、後經制裁調整委員會在公開會議時通過之英代表艾登所發對於意國　出品應一律禁絕之提議現幾獲有各國一致之贊助、蘇俄小恊約國巴爾幹恊約國與斯堪的那維亞半島諸國對此提議、贊助尤力（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聯决議通知美德</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）哈瓦斯社記者就負責方面探悉國聯會不擬要求德國與美國參加目前所計畫之對意制裁方案、但國聯會對於制裁問題所有决定、則不問會員國與非會員國、均一律予以通知、所有國聯會關於該問題之討論經過及决議、均經分別通知柏林及華盛頓政府云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於抵制意國輸出品問題、英法兩國政府未向國務院提出交涉、要求美國出而參加消息靈通人士相信、美國立塲係以戰時中立法爲歸宿、不致有所變更、羅斯福總統日前發表宣言、謂美國人民與交戰國交易者、倘遇有危險、須當自行負責、若干人士卽責以逾越職權範圍、又安望其能有進一步之舉動、各報記者頃以美國若果拒不參加國聯會所决定之經濟制裁辦法、其效力必爲之减削一層、詢諸商業部畏羅伯、羅伯當以閃爍之詞作答、幷拒不說明美國是否準備以原料品加入禁運淸單之列、僅謂「吾人現願研究一切問題、俾克採取必要之行動」云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯發動停供煤油</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）外傳日内瓦方面現正舉行談判、以諜完全停止意國之媒油供、給此說頃已由煤油業方面加以徵實、對意國停止供給煤油之議、聞係田蘇聯發動、而英國則竭力加以贊成、各國煤油公司代理人、現拒絕發表何種宣言、但英美兩國煤油公司現爲此事、在日內瓦舉行談判、則係屬實、至關於羅馬尼亞所產煤油、聞羅國政府尙無切實表示、僅謂倘令該國媒油停止輸出意國、則應補償其損失云、又英國方面以爲意國在羅馬尼亞獲有煤汕讓與機、因此如實施煤油割裁、是否徒勞無益、亦殊成問題云、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>俄在國聯之策略　日人之觀察　旨在獲英援助以制日</h3>
<p>（東京）朝日新聞今日載有「可靠方面」消息、蘇俄外委李維諾夫曾向英國不管部閣員艾登詢問、將來如蘇俄土地爲敵侵入、英國其願實施制裁否、該報加以評論、謂此項消息現殊惹人注意、蓋衆視蘇俄之行爲爲一種奇異策略志在引國聯爲其熱切援助者、而籍以獲遏制日本之道、該報又稱、國聯制裁委員會近開會時、李維諾夫如英國然、取强硬之態度、促謂委員會對不與國聯合作實施對意制裁之各國、無論其會員國或非會員國、一律加以制裁云、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>名譽博士學位之授予問題</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>曩昔徐世昌任北政府總統時代。法國巴黎大學曾以文學博士學位。贈予徐氏。此爲中國人受外人贈與名譽學位之始。不數年前。名戲劇家梅蘭芳遊美。又蒙美國坡馬那大學贈與文學博士學位。上海約翰大學。亦曾數以名譽博士學位贈與國內之。政界要人及社會聞人。最近復旦舉行三十週紀念時。亦以名譽博士學位授與孫科等六人。迥溯名譽博士在中國授予之歷史。已有多年。此種制度之得失。雖難斷言。然普通公私大學有無授予博士或名譽博士學位之權限。在今日之中國。當不失爲一值得討論之問題。按民國十九年教育部對於大學授予名譽學位事。曾有明令禁化。本月十四日。教部亦通令各大學在學。位法未公佈前。不得擅自授學位。良以授予學位。必須極度愼重。然後受之者。始能重視其價值。而不失其獎勸之效用。若贈之者不由其道。而其用意又別有所在。則效尤者必將羣起。雖欲不喪失其學位之尊嚴性與可貴性不可得也。</p>
<p>近十數年來。我國戴有博士頭銜者。日見增加。然叩其所給予者。則莫非爲外國之大學。就中尤以　國爲多。然所謂博士者。其名號是否眞與其實質相當。每成一大疑問。且國人之獲取外國大學博士者。其所憑論文往往取材於中國問題之類。外人對於中國問題。旣不了了。何能嚴其博士學位之授予。且事實上因中國論文而獲博士學位者。往往徒負虛譽。不獨對西洋文化。不克盡其紹介之責。卽對中國之文物制度亦未必有特殊之研究。且據美國教育研究會調査。美國授予博士學位之大學研究。院平均有三十餘所。然嚴格言之。所授學位眞能名符其實者。不過七所。就此一點。美國。博士學位授予之濫。可以概見。我人於此應有二種覺悟。（一）外國博士。未必盡爲有實學之學問家。故國家有重加考試。或另行授予學位之必要。（二）國內外各大學漫無標準的授予博士之現象。應從早設法防止。以免流於浮濫。一言以蔽之。博士學位之贈予。其權應操自國家。其事不妨由考試院教育部中央研究院。會同辦理。如此經過相當時期。或能樹立中國學術獨立之其礎。收回外向已久之獎學權也</p>
<p>至於名譽博士。亦以國家贈予爲最相宜。受者之資格宜有嚴格。之規定。務使此等學位。完全用於獎勵有關生產之學術文化。至若個人在政治上之功勳。似可由政府另以勳章之類。給予獎勵。良以我國今後國運之復興。端在物質方面之建設。故對於發明家之獎勵。自應盡最大之努力。筆者之意。凡在純粹科學上能爲理論原理之發口者。固當由國家授以名譽博士學位。同時凡能在機械上工藝上有特殊發明者。亦應予以名譽博士學位。用資獎勵。若然。不較漫無標準之授予爲佳耶。</p>
<p>最後。我人以爲此一問題至大且　。國內教育專家。似應亟起注意。多貢意見。俾立法者有所借鑒。以利進行。同時考試院立法院教育部與中央研究院方面亦應儘速草擬學位授予辦法。公布實行。庶幾國人漸可認識學位之尊嚴矣。</p>

<h3>阿軍十萬備開前綫　東菲大戰將開始　北路意軍進窺瑪加爾　南路沿希比利河推進</h3>
<p>阿京　阿比西尼亞總司令部準備將集中此間之軍隊開發前綫作戰、全局勝負卽可分曉、軍隊之目的地現守秘密、惟據今日有力方面表示、阿軍主力防綫將在此間東北某地及特賽與狄里達華之間、陸軍部長葛泰及其他閣員或將親率私人軍隊參戰、政府官員及部落酉長均將加入、觀察者預測阿皇卽將赴前綫、設立總部、此間一般人咸信、阻碍意軍自索謀里方面南下之雨水、使阿人急遽决定採取攻勢、駐紮阿京郊外之野蠻部落民族數千人、因爭先赴前綫與意軍决戰、遂發生內鬨、結果傷三十人、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　意軍已在北陣綫取新攻勢、進窺距阿杜華東南六十五哩之瑪加爾、該城爲意軍進攻之第二大目的物、據阿京今日所接之消息、意軍刻正從事包圍之、聞意飛機兩架今日飛於阿京吉波蒂鐵路上阿夫丹與比克特二車站附近之天空按該二站介於阿京與哈拉爾之間、意軍並在南陣綫續沿希比利河流域而進、其地氣侯酷熱、加以各部落民衆仇意甚烈、故意軍所處之境况甚爲艱困、阿京四周現駐有大軍十萬人、平原一帶、滿播營帳、共達數萬、婦女孩童僕役亦成羣結隊隨戰士開往前綫、今日有一女子騎白騾、後隨百人、至王宮前請發軍械、俾赴前淺助戰、見者爲之動容、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　如意軍當局繼續將南部白兵調往他處、則南部阿軍總司令那西布將軍或將對意軍取攻勢據各方面消息、內地軍隊、調動甚忙、足徵大戰之期、卽將開始、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　據南部巴里省吉尼爾來訊徵實阿軍現謀卽向東南前進、與希比利河附近之山谷密切接觸、因瘴氣及乏水之故、欲由哈拉爾南下進攻、似不可能、惟經行瀕於希比利河之比較略低之地、可疾擊意軍左翼、此次進攻、將以台斯太將軍所率之巴里省各部落首領爲前導、該將在阿京郊外之別墅、現仍供意使文西伯爵居住、阿軍不若意軍之須携糧而行、彼等可就地取食、實佔甚大之便利、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>張氏略歷</p>
<p>張君字孝若、名怡祖、一字潛廬、年三十八歲、南通望族、遜淸狀元張謇（字季直）先生之長公子也、張君年少英俊、學貫中西、幼承庭訓、克紹箕裘、年二十、卽赴美留學、得工學士學位、歸國後、佐父經營實業、首創淮海實業銀行、任總經理、民十一、特任考察歐美實業專使、十三年任智利全櫬公使、十五年任掦子江水道委員會會長等要職、建白極多、</p>
<p>近年事來</p>
<p>旋季直先生逝世、氏遂無志仕進、　心編輯先人　著張季子九錄、並繼承先業、致全力於實業慈善教育、先後被選南通學院校長、大生紗廠董事長、大達輪船公司總經理、淮南各鹽墾公司常務董事董事長、大陸報館董事等、年來實業鹽墾、日處風雨飄搖之中、氏苦心撑持、朝夕不遑、先業賴以不墜、每日必親赴以上各機關洽商要公、晚間回寓以爲常、平日待人極和易胸次超曠、素無仇怨、</p>
<p>老僕行兇</p>

<p>槍殺主人</p>
<p>前日（十六日）下午二時許、吳又自通乘大達輪來滬、手提木質手提箱一只、下輪後、郎逕至張寓見張、循例當晚卽宿於張家、張與妾李氏之臥房在二層樓前房、是晚、吳與張之傭僕周芝美（三十一歲、常州人、）同宿於張之後房臥室内、詎知吳此次來滬、已預存殺張之念、故隨身帶來盒子砲一支、（此槍季直先生在日吳充護兵時發給者、）暗藏手提箱内、至昨晨淸晨六時、吳乘張家傭僕等尙未起身之際、彼起身下牀、持所帶之盒子砲、躡足掩入張之臥房、時張與妾了氏睡在牀上、熟悉睡未醒、吳卽對張之左脇開放一槍、珠彈洞穿右脅、血流滿牀、頓時氣絕殞命、</p>
<p>張孝若氏遺像</p>
<p>兇手自戕</p>
<p>張妾於睡夢中猝聞槍聲、驚醒下牀、大聲呼喊救命、方行抵房門口時、亦被吳對準氏之胸部右乳旁開放一槍、氏中彈倒地、吳見目的已達、懷槍下樓圖逃、繼又想及前後門均已下鍵、難以脫身、待走至樓梯脚邊、卽持盒子砲對自己胸部開放一槍自殺、迨張之家人傭僕聞聲驚醒、起身察看、祇見吳已倒臥樓梯脚下血泊中、呻吟不止、上樓看視張李氏倒臥房門口、鮮血汨汨流出、人已昏迷、張則已死在牀上、鮮血染滿牀褥、</p>
<p>長女痛哭</p>
<p>卽由當差用電話報告法捕房、立召救護車前往、將張李氏與兇手吳義高車送廣慈醫院急救醫治、一面將張之尸體、舁送同仁輔元分堂騐尸所、候報法院檢騐、乃吳亦因傷在胸部要害、抵醫院卽氣絕、由捕房將尸併送駝尸所張之在滬親友、已經得信趕至駝尸所察視張之尸體、張之長女名非武、年二十歲、現在務本女子中學肄業、寄宿梭內、經家人往報、亦趕赴騐尸所、見父尸痛哭、由親友勸止、</p>
<p>法院相騐</p>
<p>至午刻、由法捕房報請特二法院檢察處、由首席檢察官喬萬選、偕魏姜兩法醫、彭翊書記官等、蒞所檢駝張吳兩尸後、升坐公案、據承辦西探及華探張勝報告、出事後調查情形、據證人張之當差周芝美投稱、兇手吳義高、係老太爺在日所用之護兵、相隨二十餘年、現派伊在南通看守老太爺老宅房屋、盆子砲他當護兵時發給他的、此次昨日來滬、下午二時到張家、晚上與我同睡在後房、不料至今晨他竟將主人殺死、我聞聲起身察看、兇手臥在樓梯下呻吟、上樓入房、見李氏倒在房門口、主人已死在床上、我卽報告捕房、</p>
<p>當差供詞</p>
<p>至吳殺主人原因、大約爲其兒子求主人提援、派的位置不好、懷恨在心、諒必爲此、以外主人待吳感情很好等語、又據尸女張非武投案、請求給領父尸、以外事據稱、她住在學校内、不明詳細、喬君核詞、遂諭騐得張孝若委係生前受槍傷身死、尸交尸女張非武領殮、又諭騐得吳義高委係生前自殺身死、尸交同仁輔元堂收殮騐畢、張之尸體、舁往中國殯儀館、定十九日上午十時成殮吳之尸體、由同仁輔元堂發給三四九三號板棺收殮、今晨運住浦東塚地埋葬、候屬認領、至張李氏現在廣慈醫院醫治、傷勢頗重、安危未定、</p>

<h3>謝福生君軼事</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>本月五日淸晨展閱本報時，忽見第二張封面廣告，有「謝福生先生於十月四日下午二點十分病歿　寓」等字，猶疑爲非海上之名繙譯家，曾任本報記者之謝君，或係同名而同姓者，蓋予雖與君數月未晤，然每遇舊友，時時問及，悉其一星期前，尙操作如故也。及閱第四張本埠新聞，忽見謝先生之　像，及「前本報記者謝福生逝世」之標題，方知此謝福生，確係上海總商會之老同事，頓覺目瞪口呆，而有人生如朝露之歎！　謝君身雖短小，精神尙健，年少於予，同事時，因其行動矯捷，面部尖瘦，僉予以一諢號曰猴子；孰料不數年後，此猴　效法悟空，向天上偸桃去矣，爰將謝先生之軼事追述一二，以表哀悼。</p>
<p>謝君不特對於英文造詣極深，卽其他各國文字與語言，亦莫不融曾貫通，任上海總商會英文秘書時，遇有國際間之酬酢，僉請其繙譯，主席致歡迎詞時，渠由中譯西，來賓致答謝詞時，又由西譯中，一人包辦，均甚流利。</p>
<p>君嗜食糖果，而秉性詼諧，上海總商會辦事員月會開會時，君雖事冗，亦必出席，來時必携陳皮梅牛奶糖等嚮客，未開會前，恐同人久待生厭，則於英文故事中，擇其有趣味者，向人講解，習以爲常，出席諸君咸引領以望此君之解悶。</p>
<p>民國十五年，孫傳芳時代，渠所辦之英文公論報，名副其實，抨擊軍閥之橫行不法，而讚美革命軍之秋毫無犯，孫氏恨之刺骨，密令淞滬警備司令李寳璋將其拘至軍署，擬以共黨二字加諸其身，處以死刑，幸由虞洽卿傳筱菴（傅時充商會會長）等向孫力保，未遭槍決，然仍拘禁不放，是年除夕，身在囹圄，據云無所消遣，除譯稿外，幷向囚徒講外國故事以解岑寂，革命軍次年抵滬後，始被釋出。</p>
<p>君自奉甚儉，所御之西裝，並不講究，雖不買汽車，但每月所出之汽車費，有時反較有汽車者爲多，因兼事太多，路遠不得不借汽車以代步，性甚落拓，向汽車行叫一汽車，由甲地至乙地，時忘回絕，及發覺，則已有三四時之勾留，汽車費須照算也。家內人口衆多，家用浩繁，且不善居積，故雖有數百元之收入，仍窮困異常。上星期中西大藥房請其將「越陳越香，繙成英文，君謂老富不客氣，予靠辦報教書以維生計，每字須譯費二元，始可照辦，周邦俊久慕其名，情願照送，豈料此次所譯，卽爲絕筆，予因「越陳越香」四字，而變成越想越悲矣。</p>

<h3>謊</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>這世面上沒專門技能的就掙不到飯吃，駡人能够駡到錢用，無怪說謊亦被人利用爲一種專門職業。</p>
<p>假使你和你的太太要一探名山勝景，儘可不必帶「遊覽指導」，似乎名勝景緻一「詳實」就覺乏味而提不上逸興了·當你們跑到山門口，甚至還未踏上第一塊石級，就有一位斯文的人來向你們含笑點頭的，你便可毫不猶豫地把「導遊」的責任委諸與他，必定會使你的太太出神。</p>
<p>山道邊有一塊橫倒的石頭，他會告訴你從前怎樣被仙人用一隻手指從山巔推下的，假使那石頭上還有個窒洞，他會煞費苦心地想出「乾隆皇帝」的足甲的故事，而又會把「劉伯溫」牽在「乾隆」一塊。山腰裏有座土地廟，他也會很負責地說：「呂純陽在這裏喝過茶的，你瞧，院子裏有一座仙井。」他很像一本正經。</p>
<p>倘你太太高興聽，你正可含笑站在半邊，要是自誇聰敏，當面揭穿他的漏洞的話，那非但「犯不着」而且你也說不出那株大松樹是誰種的？歷史上亦無從稽考。好在你不是考古，聽聽謊話散散心，並非完全沒有好處。至多，他說完個十八，或三十六個古蹟後，要求你買他幾盒當地土產或幾張碑帖罷了。</p>
<p>得明白，他是靠說謊吃飯的人！</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后的坑上所用的枕頭，說來倒又是一件很異樣的東西，而且還是有些歷史的關係的。原來伊的外表上雖說很快活，很驕傲，但伊的內心上也不免藏着一重相當的恐怖，祗是伊自己竭力的隱秘着，不肯公然道出罷了！這重　怖究竟是什麼呢？就是惟恐有人會買嗎了什麼有本領的人，偷進宮來行刺。這重恐怖本不是無而起的：有一次的確有過一個人很大膽地偸進了頤和園，想加不利於太后；當時宮內少不得就有相當的騷動，而伊老人家也不免受了幾許的驚嚇，但經無數的兵將努力搜捕之後，那刺客終於給他們抓住了，當日便正了法，事情總算很迅速地有了結束；可是太后的膽却從此嚇破了，伊想這一遭雖然幸而免禍，下次怎能保得不會再來。於是忙着加添警衛，並且還將伊晚上用的枕頭加了一番改造，就是在中部開一個銀圓大小的孔兒，對直貫穿，活像是人家打高而夫球的小洞。</p>
<p>伊睡的時候，就把伊的一個耳朶緊貼在這個洞口上；好在這洞就在枕的中間，一睡上去，便不難使伊的左耳或右耳緊貼着了。這樣的佈置伊認爲是可以使伊把附近的一切聲息，格外聽得淸楚一些的。我因爲不很相信，有一次便親自躺上去試了一試；（當太后不在左右的當兒，凡伊所用的種種東西，我是都得悄悄地偸試一遭的。）也許是我受了一種心理作用的支配，那也說不定，不過我的耳覺上似乎的確覺得　枕上的一孔，頗有幾分和掦聲筒相等的功效，至少，並非完全無用。（四三八）</p>
<p>逰踪所至</p>
<h3>銀座之夜</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>東京最繁盛的市角，東部是日本橋京橋銀座，西部是新宿。新宿是大地震後才繫盛起來的。現在雖沒有銀座的繁盛，將來至少可以和銀座並駕齊驅。因爲那裏有一個公娼區，是優勢之點。擔起了東京，總要講起銀座。日本人對銀座感情之好，興趣之濃，是無以復加的。讚美得和倫教紐約一樣，只少了泰晤時河上的大橋和高聳天空的摩天樓罷了。意大利的威尼斯，以河流作市街，小艇作交通，是名聞全球的「水的都市」。於是日本人便讚美銀座爲「陸的都市」，因爲兩旁高起的建築物，好像河岸。汽車來往，如威尼斯的小艇一樣，往來如織。總之日本的銀座，將捧爲「世界的銀座」了，這不得不佩服他們宣傳能力的高明了。</p>
<p>日本橋京橋銀座新橋是一條連續的直綫形的街道，兩旁商店林立，交通頻繁，銀座居中，所以最爲繁盛。交通有汽車電車高架電車，地下電車，又和銀行區娛樂區的「丸之內」又近，是日本布　階級唯一的享福去處。丸之內也是新闢的區域，全是銀行和洋行，東京寶塚劇塲，帝國劇塲，大電影院，都在附近。於是銀行洋行的職員和戲院裏的觀衆，都要乘便到銀座去走一回，所以銀座街上整天的士女如雲，車水馬龍的喧鬧着。在旁的街上，所看到的日本人是沉毅勞苦而緊張的。獨有銀座的日本人又換了一番情形，瀟灑安閑而浪漫的。倘然同旁的街道一樣緊張的行走着，一定要踏痛前面人</p>
<p>日本人時常咒罵地震，和怨恨軟弱的土地，使他們不能像美國一樣的建造幾十層的大廈，遜色不少。照日本的土地，只能限定造　層樓的高屋，建築物遠不及我國上海漢口的偉大。三越伊東屋白木屋等大公司，沿路樹窗裏，佈置得花團錦簇，不由你不站定了觀看一下。公司裏面滿是紅嘴唇細眉毛的女職員，打着笑臉的接待你。幾架電梯和轉梯把羣衆上下輸着。倘然時間空閑的話，不妨各部細細兒去欣賞，飽飽眼福。在樓上樓下散步了一回，依舊走了出來，到門外，女招待，依然對你九十度的鞠躬道謝，你不妨睬都不睬的大踏步去了。很有許多人以大公司為散步休息去處的，或邀不　跋涉到屋頂上或是地下食堂去進食。在旁的飯店裏總覺得出菜太慢。而大公司的食堂裏，常要等了幾十分鐘才有飯吃，或是要立在旁邊，等着座位。吃飯如此艱難而座上客常滿，眞是矛盾事情。更有人進了大公司不買東西，匆匆的走入廁所去了，也是常有的事情，尤以女性爲多。日本公共廁所在繁盛地方是沒有的，只有奉送給大公司，是唯一辦法。</p>
<p>除了大公司之外，便是跳舞塲咖啡店酒店。走到裏面，黯淡的五色電燈光裏，只看見男子和女性並坐着低聲調笑。啤酒咖啡，一杯杯的向喉嚨裏倒下去。每一爿咖啡店裏常有近百的女性預備着，招待雇客。身入其境，宛如到了女兒國裏一般。跳舞塲大都不買飲食，客座很少。舞罷休息，都立在旁邊，等着歌詞再起。舞票從角餘至二角餘不等，很多閨秀女子進跳舞塲，去消磨良宵的。。</p>
<p>五色的年紅燈把沿街的牆壁，點綴殆遍。在各種不同的光綫交織之下，整千整萬的羣衆，在下面移動着。銀座是日本布爾階級的「散步之街。」路旁布棚子裏，各種小販，等候着散步者來光顧。立在黑角裏的馬路藝術家，得而蓬鬆的頭髮，黑領結破西裝，托一盤顏色，費了兩角錢，便可立着速寫一張肯像。路上只見靑年紳士，穿着筆挺的西裝，挾着各色洋服的淑女。那裏日本裝很少，即使有也是高貴的絲織品，非普通人所夢想的。時間漸漸轉移，在晨光初曦的時候，一切繁華都消失了。從淺川貧民羣走出來的拾垃圾者，背上肩着竹簍，來拾取紳士淑女們的廢棄物了。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>朱氏道：八毛錢一天，我們總還住得起！你就把屋子打開來，讓我們進去。茶房要把錢的話去僵他，不想他就答應了給錢，這倒沒有更好的法子去挾制他們，只管搔着頭髮，發出苦笑來。志前在身上掏出一塊。錢來塞給茶房手上道：　！這一塊錢我代給了，那裹　不能作好事，你們這樣心硬！茶房看了一看志前的顏色，歎了一口氣道：這是何苦，讓我們爲難。於是走到對面屋子裏，將一間小屋子的門推開，望了胡嫂子道：讓他們進去哭罷。我去通知賬房了。胡嫂子也覺得在這過廳裏大家圍了看着，與人家旅館裏生意有妨碍，這就苦笑道：你們祖孫三代，到那邊屋子裏去坐坐罷，把話說完了，我們還是回家。免得賈老爺回來了，帶累了月英。他究竟是在人家家裹的日子長，難道你們不替他想想嗎，胡嫂子口裏說着，心裏是想得很淸楚，這件事全在老太太身上，於是扶着老太太，就向小子裏去。果然的，大家也都跟了去了。那些看熱鬧的人，見人家已經進了屋子，不能跟着也向屋子裏追了去，聽人家的秘密話，所以大家散了。其實他們三代人，隔開以後，什麼事全覺得沒有一個交代。及至見面以後，倒想不出來有什麽可說的，所以倒反是彼此面面相覷。（三四二）</p>

<h3>壓倒楊秀瓊　劉標王珍一鳴驚人</h3>
<p>女五十公尺决賽意外結果　卅六秒二破全國亦破遠運　美人魚初遭失敗屈亞軍</p>
<p>昨日游泳變、女子組二項决賽、五十公尺自由式及一百公尺仰泳、皆出於一般意料之外、造成極優越之成績、縱橫游泳池、未曾遇到敵手之楊秀瓊、昨日於五十公尺决賽中、竟爲廣東劉桂珍小姐所壓倒、相差極徵、比賽中途、競爭極烈、楊秀瓊在複賽曾以三六秒優越之成績、故觀衆視線皆集中美人魚、萬頭鑽動、掌聲如雷、在未賽前攝影皆爭先恐後、爲之攝影、以冠軍當無問題、詎料　聲一發、粵之劉桂珍即佔優勢、楊秀瓊終不超左右、以三六秒到達終點、楊秀瓊僅以一手之差、屈居亞軍、</p>
<p>破紀錄壓倒人魚</p>
<p>女子五十公尺自由决賽上塲、空氣白熱、達於極點、鎗聲一響、吶喊聲四起、但見水花濺處、人魚秀瓊、位列第三、粵將劉桂珍、在先領導、一掠過廿五公尺界綫、其時人魚尙落後約三尺、四座人氣、更爲狂熱、尤以粵選手、更手之舞之、足之蹈之、而一方爲人魚打氣者、更大有人在、人魚潑刺一聲、如矢離弦、漸漸趕上、詎劉僅數吋、最後五公尺內、奮爭尤烈、終以些微之差、被劉占得驚頭、成績卅六秒二、破秀瓊保持之遠東紀錄卅六秒九三、及全國紀錄卅卅八秒二、但尙不及秀瓊複賽中之卅六秒成績、其餘諸人、相差極微、至玉輝薰英、不幸落選、此項粵入選四人、共獲十四分、港則僅得八分、</p>
<p>劉桂珍笑逐顏開</p>

<p>楊秀瓊別有滋味</p>
<p>五十公尺賽後、楊小姐　居亞軍、出水後、左右清清無人過問、粉臉含暈、眼眶若不勝傷楚、獨自垂頭掃興、逕往休息、嚶嚶啼泣、女士自享盛名以來、第一次爲人壓倒、心中自有一番滋味也、</p>

<h3>男四百公尺自由預賽　楊維莫破紀錄</h3>
<p>五分四十九秒二　决賽冠軍無問題</p>
<p>男四百公尺自由式預賽、共分六組舉行、成績以馬華楊維英之五分四十九秒三、破全國紀錄爲最佳、滬施博根之六分一秒九、閩陳樹林之六分二秒一、亦稍堪人意、各領一組、其餘成績平平、港陳震南爲長途健將、昨未顯工夫、聞留以有待最堪發笑者、爲第一組比賽時、僅得粵麥偉明蘇王厚昌二人參加、王成綾去麥甚遠、達終點時、已歷時十分許、麥游畢、王尙未達三百公尺、然因兩人參加、故亦得列第二、第一組達四人、僅粵麥偉明與蘇王厚昌、探閱時計、麥爲六分十三秒三、王爲十分四十七秒、第二組仍有二人棄權、粵石錦培原爲長距名將、確具功夫、京彭宗貴亦非弱者、競爭殊烈、最後一匝、尙成駢肩、石賴最後衝刺、爭得第一、彭落後達九尺、第三組施博根顯出功夫、着着領先、餘子望　莫及、僅桂雷秉昌能緊追不捨、終點距施僅十尺、確爲可貴、平陶用中泳法雖不高明、惟氣能奮力到達終點、頗博觀衆同情、第五組馬華楊維莫爲此中能手先聲奪領袖羣倫、桂黃景煥不甘示弱緊隨不捨、百公尺時、已然並駕齊驅、嗣後兩人始終不離、最後一匝、楊努力衝刺、如矢離弦、以十四餘公尺領先、奪得首名、五分四十九秒、破史興　保持之全國紀錄、冀楊仍以蛙泳殿軍、距楊有三匝之多、第五組閩陳樹林以六分二秒一之優異成績、壓倒港之陳福星、可稱冷門、陳全程平均、衝刺欠佳、浙小將丁兆華則以十尺之差落選、甚爲可惜、第六組僅閩洪安訓及港陳震南參加、餘均棄權、中途不先不後、最後衝刺、速度均佳、終點洪以一臂之先壓倒震南南可稱難能、成績如下、</p>
<p>創四百公尺自由式泳全國新紀錄　楊維莫</p>
<h3>男女游泳兩標　穩落廣東之手　陳振興楊秀瓊兩人　分獲男女總分第一</h3>

<h3>佔先三公尺擊退梁詠嫻　楊秀瓊百尺仰泳冠軍</h3>
<p>一分三七秒四亦破遠運　五十公尺失敗後之慰藉</p>
<p>楊秀瓊旣於五十公尺决賽、意外爲人屈服、一百公尺仰泳决賽登塲、亦有勁敵廣東梁詠嫻、頗有一般人爲之躭心、以預賽中梁之成績、較優於楊秀瓊也、四座空氣、一時緊張之至、秀瓊爲保持令名計、故亦集中全力、作背城借一之拚命、果然將梁詠嫻打倒、造成一分三十七秒四意想不到之優異成績、梁詠嫻雖敗、成績亦頗斐然可觀也、</p>
<p>最後三十米</p>
<p>一聲號令、八條人魚、向前直鑽、梁於第一程尙着先鞭、於七十公尺時、爲秀瓊超過、終點佔先三公尺許、成績一分三十七秒四、破本人保持之三十八秒遠東紀錄、以一分四十五秒之全國紀錄、較預賽時梁之一分四十一秒一及本人之一分四十三秒二、超出許多、無怪泳罷離水時、又受數十鏡頭之包圍、桂小姐龐永芳力掙得第三、且壓倒秀珍、難能可貴、</p>
<p>梁小姐亦哭</p>
<p>七十公尺時、梁詠嫻尙居前列、此時祇見楊秀瓊仰飄水面、咬牙閉眼、努力掙扎、速度突然加速、後勁可畏、爲其得勝主因、梁體質不如、致遭屈服、出水後、梁小姐不禁悲從中來、淚簌簌下、其志可嘉、梁小姐必有出頭一日、歸返休息室、尙見其舉臂拭淚也、决賽成績如下</p>

<p>網球今日男女子全屬雙打决賽、上午九時之滬馬複賽、必有劇戰、馬華二單打因全敗於上海、勢必在雙打中報仇雪恨、並抱有染指冠軍之决心、林望蘇與阮國英配合凑巧、有如天衣無縫、且阮國英之雙打表演、尤在林望蘇之上、其實力可想而知矣、上海欲圖奪得本屆大會錦標、林邱組際此大敵當前、决不首輕易放鬆、是組勝者、即於今日下午再與爪哇决賽、以定雙打錦標、同時滬馬複賽之失敗者、與四川王文正錢耀彬决第三四名、女子雙打山西與四川决賽、王氏姊妹穩操勝券、上海馬華則决第三四名、</p>
<p>女子籃球滬粵决賽</p>
<p>上届錦標上海隊、本屆視錦標如襄中物、初賽次賽複賽、一路順風、全不費力、滬隊視爲唯一勁敵之福建隊、球藝不如前屆、昨日複賽、已爲廣東擊敗、今日上海乃與廣東爭榮奪霜、粵隊技術、亦夙負盛名、屆時决賽、必甚劇烈、複賽失敗者江蘇與福建、則决第三四名、勝者再與滬粵决賽之失敗者、爭第二第三名次、男子籃球爲複賽、冀對平、滬對京、旗鼓相捋、難免惡戰、</p>
<p>女子籃球滬粵决賽</p>
<p>男排自初賽兩次賽而複賽、今日即將舉行複賽、由滬粵兩隊對壘、一爲上屆錦標隊名宿、一爲南國排球戰將之盟主、兩雄相遇、自然難解難分、戰爭結果如何、目下猶難逆料、惟以連日戰跡觀之、滬隊進攻力量較大、但後排聯絡、不免稍走碼子、粵隊閂門未見活躍、此爲最大吃虧、决賽時兩隊如能各加補救、則錦標得主、即視其補救之程度如何而定、三四名决賽、由香港對馬來、則港隊比較吃硬、二三名决賽、則須視錦標解决後、方可推知局勢、女排球本日有兩塲複賽、湖南對廣東一塲、湖南必定吃癟、上海對北平、亦可直落三、迅速解决、十九日錦票賽、上每盟主雖望蟬聯、但以廣東數球之兇、應恩患預防、以免失之千里、三四名複賽、北平將遭淘汰、二三名決賽、則將視錦標落選球隊之陣容而定、</p>
<p>男子棒球滬粵奪權</p>
<p>此次棒球賽、滬粵兩隊之得决賽權、早在意料之中、上海隊雖係本年新創之年、但以訓練有素、人材出衆、對於大會錦標、抱有極大决心、廣樂隊有攸久之歷史關係、人材平平、實力自屬不凡、本屆錦標賽、不知鹿死誰手、</p>

<h3>女子壘球　山東得女壘球錦標　昨日决賽十比六克河北　上屆冠軍上海退居第四</h3>
<p>女子壘球錦標、本屆參加者上海·江蘇·河北·南京·山東·廣東·等六隊、自十一日開賽以來、歷經大戰、至昨日止、上屆錦標廣東業已失落其覇權、而歸山東隊所有、上海則名列第四、今日上午九時河北將與廣東作二三名之决賽、爲本屆最後之一幕、</p>
<h3>山東榮膺冠軍　七局終了各得六分搆和　延長賽中山東加上四分</h3>
<p>山東初勝南京、繼拔廣東、再克河北、三戰三勝、榮膺冠軍、全隊投擊優美、作戰勇敢、以及合作佳妙、三者已具、得此榮譽、亦應得之酬報也、河北所具優點、與錦標隊相彷彿、所不及者、未蒙幸運兒之靑睞也、七局終了、雙方各得六分、成和局、延長比賽之中、山東一氣加上四分、乃以十對六勝河北、奪得錦標、山東投手張慕霞、接手金志範、河北投手陸韻嫣、接手陸慶嫣、司球裁判員申國權、司壘裁判員崔亞蘭、紀錄員夏開明、</p>
<p>四記安打造成勝利</p>
<p>山東隊　後勝利、即產生在七局相和後之第八局、一連四記安打、加跑帶偷、獲得四分、於是高下乃分、雙方成績比較、山東十一次安打、得十分、河北九次安打得六分、偷壘工夫、山東優於河北、蓋前者有十二次、後者僅八次也、</p>
<p>勁敵相逢勢成對抗</p>
<p>山東先攻、王鳳傑初試不利、金志範繼登、擊出安打、占一壘、一再賠襲、占三壘、值投手出野球、飛步歸疊、爲山東立第一功、河北反守爲攻、黃秀蓮蓮跑加倫、轉眼至三壘、崔惠嫻一記安打、助甚成功、第一局各得一分、第二局堅璧清野、各守疆界、第三局山東三將出戰受挫、河北陳蘭湘突出驚人之舉、作本壘打、得一分、陸慶嫣亦得一安打、奈同伴不得力、第三局河北一、山東零、</p>
<p>七局終結不分高下</p>
<p>第四局山東張淑芳之一壘打、及龐素貞之本壘打、在其本人獲分之前、又送歸張慕霞、二記安打、得三分、河北繼擊、初山凍馮　英與龐素貞合作雙殺、希望斷絕、第五局山東失勢、河北氣盛、初陸　嫣步走一壘、連倫至三壘、繼同伴陳蘭湘助以三壘打　陸奏凱旋而歸、陸亦以山東接手之錯誤、同時還壨、是局山東零、河北二、第六局山東張淑芳得一安打、助者不力、勞而無功、河北上塲、陸惠瑾首出安打、得一壘、偷兩壘、駐於三壘、李文秀繼擊安打、陸即歸壘、爲河北加一分、是局起、陣綫各有調動、河北山東之中堅與右翼、均互換其位、第七局山東發現二記安打、馮關英梁光因此先後歸壘、河北陳蘭湘一記安打之下、山東中堅左　發生誤會、陳乃乘　而還、七局終結、各得六分不分高下、</p>
<p>延長比賽奠定錦標</p>
<p>七局終了、分數相同、延長比賽、以决勝負、山東張慕霞荷棒先登、振臂揮出、高越二壘而過、成三壘打、值河北中堅失漏、張乃欣然奔還、張淑芳龐素貞相繼得安打、明偷暗襲、亦均順利、侯玉貞又加上安打、張龎絕不躊躇、還壘報功、侯亦不久奏旋而返、此四記安打、速得四分、實爲二隊生死之關鍵、河北亦作最後奮鬥、因受山東之封鎖、志未得逞、垂頭喪氣、而告失敗、</p>

<h3>廣東大敗上海　上海空前慘敗比數三對三十二　廣東今日與河北作二三名决賽</h3>
<p>廣東上海同在複賽中失敗、乃於昨晨九時作三四名决賽、上海遭空前慘敗、以三對三十二之結果、退列第四、廣東則於今晨九時與決賽失敗之河北隊、作二三名决賽、昨日司球裁判員侯洛洵、司壘裁判員高梓、記錄員夏開明、</p>
<p>實力懸殊每局必失</p>
<p>上海投手杜素貞、經騐不足、一逢大敵、心慌意亂、接手錢坤格、功過相抵、其他隊員、均難合作、遂予對方絕大進攻機會、一時上海陣內、但見廣東鐵騎四出、縱橫逞雄、開始第一局甚有聲色、奪得二分、後此頻頻告失、終至不可收拾、第六局雖挽還一分、業已無補大局、</p>
<p>個個活躍人人建功</p>
<p>廣東戰勝上海、可謂得意之作、登塲人員、紀錄薄中、均右功續、上海第一局得二分、至第六局又得一分、共討三分、廣東則第一局五分、第二局三分、第三局竟得十四分之多、第四局四分、第五局一分、第六局五分、第七局犧牲不打、廣東投手梁適宜、接手粱莊兒、合作佳妙、梁且於第三局本隊得十分之後、出一全壘打、引起全塲采擊、</p>

<h3>女子排球　港馬淘汰　滬粵競奪錦標　滬直落三勝港　粵三比一勝馬</h3>
<p>男子排球複賽、昨日下午分兩塲舉行、（一）上海對香港、滬三對〇勝、（二）廣東對馬來亞、粵三對一勝、從此滬粵兩隊、又跳過一關、今日下午三時、將舉行奪標賽、死活存亡、即可分明雌雄、</p>
<p>上海勝香港</p>
<p>流年不佳港隊失利</p>
<p>上海香港於下午一時開賽、裁判員丘紀祥、發號施令、港軍擁有李沃林·盧百寗諸將、發球伊後、着實厲害、滬隊流年不佳、百對烈日、以致對方來球、錯過機會、因此開球即連失三城、上海陳博才發球、亦平平而過、上海本爲上屆錦標隊、宿將豐集、是局首屈下風、非但錦標無染指希望、且幾年心血、亦將傷於一旦、故中路將士、若曹遷贊·丘廣慶·皆各顯神通、努力反攻、果然得心應手、於七比八時追至十一比八、換塲以後、順風順水、硬手硬脚·以廿一對十三之比、對香港各將先作一下馬威、</p>
<p>中排鬆懈沒精打彩</p>
<p>第二局港軍彭蔀農發球、前後護衛倍周、生死所繫、大有性命交關之勢、來潮踴躍、得分不多、中排邊將李振安失之過火、高球壓境、一失手時、馴致見死不救、上半塲仍以七對十一爲滬隊佔據上風、掉過陣容、上海前排活躍非常、而香港反欲以硬功取勝、於是經不起滬隊閉關自守、港隊雖球出如狂風暴雨、而什九以門禁森嚴、反打回票、失地難復、浚精打彩、勝利仍歸上海、香港冉失一局、比數香港十二上海廿一、</p>
<p>銳不可當香港淘汰</p>
<p>第三局香港一籌莫展、徒見飛將軍、丘廣　縱縱跳跳、揮拳如雨、銳氣囂張、香港實無法應付、而滬隊衛鼎彝、更助桀為瘧、表演似神、港隊楚歌四面、一任强鄰之支配宰割、毫無反抗餘地、李沃林雖居中呼應、顧力竭聲嘶、獨脚戲終難博得彩聲、是局又以十三比廿一爲上海淘汰、總結果爲三對〇、上海得决賽權、</p>
<p>（二）廣東勝馬來</p>
<p>殺劈之烈等於肉搏</p>
<p>廣東馬來亞排球複賽、繼滬港之爭而起、三時登塲、粵馬兩隊、實力平衡、馬來全綫、昨且加工努力、因此討好不少、戰幕旣啟、隊健兒、各有决勝雄心、殺劈之烈、等於肉搏、上半塲進退相同、並存均勢、下半塲始現緊張局勢、連珠砲聲令人聞而喪膽、馬來後排鄭心敏、中排黃秀仁、前排林天賜輩、亦有法難使、當以十七對廿一之比失利、</p>
<p>飛舞躍仆各不讓步</p>
<p>馬來亞以久訓之師、遠道來征、屢次戰來、未遇勁旅、今複賽局中、初逢猛將、自然少不得担驚受嚇、二塲開始、全比差、因形勢嚴重、表賽乃益見精彩、看　上正塞滿球哥球妹、鶯燕驕憨、各為捧塲、一時兩區戰將、飛舞躍仆、煞是好看、球員中本全部爲廣東同鄉、比時以各爲其主、亦不稍讓步、雖一分之失、均屬非常小氣、立須索還、迨最後五分鐘時、馬來竟以以一比十九二分之勝算、而奪回一局、</p>
<p>失地太多無從救藥</p>
<p>休息片刻、大家商籌應付妙計、竣事、再開血戰、羊城大將胡應才、發球得獲二分、馬來還他顏色、亦有造就、你來我往、短兵相接、觀衆眼花頭暈、幾不辨誰是誰非、正在落花流水之中、公證人已宣布換塲、馬來時僅九分、當時圈轉馬頭、左衝右突、亦一無生路、比馬來梁居發球、以機遇之佳、大爲得利、然以失地太多、沉痼之疾、終歸不救、比數爲十四對廿一、廣東又佔上風、</p>
<p>陷馬坑裹逃生乏術</p>
<p>第四局、馬來認生死關鍵、在此一舉、故不敢草率待慢、乃初生之犢、究不慣重重壓迫、廣東軍容、一時整飾嶄新、起手殺球、毫無還價、馬來亞全部人馬、幾如墮入陷馬坑裏、欲圖反身、已不可能、更遑論有所進取、故上半塲僅十一對五、換塲過後、輪至粵軍黃英傑發球、一連接二、馬來皆坐以觀敗、連發連中、多至八分、最後由梅迪賢以生辣乾脆之方法、得後排傳球、力殺完成大業、是局比數爲廿一對十九、廣東得大奏得勝歌、</p>

<p>男子單打、昨日複賽兩組、於下午一時啟賽、許承基對林寶華、劇戰四盤、方分勝負、結果許藉砲彈式之發球、及峻急之抽球、控制全局、而表演之精彩、尤爲大會以來所未見、林則背城借一、拼命週旋、雖取得第三盤、卒因技術稍偏、甘拜下風、邱飛海對錢耀彬、一對牛皮糖、精彩少見、血戰四盤、邱始取得决賽權、許邱兩人、將於明日互爭首席、林錢兩人、亦同時舉行三四名决賽、許邱决賽、許可穩得冠軍、林之勝錢、亦可無疑、於是林邱兩人、又將於後日作兄弟戰、以定第二第三、</p>

<p>許承基自大會開幕以來、戰無不勝、攻無不克、一敗徐燎培、再敗王文正、且從未失去一盤、氣勢之盛、無與倫比、砲彈式之發球、雷霆千鈞之過頂高壓、峻急無比之正反抽擊、在在高人一等、且其回擊峻疾、落點至佳、不但球技高超、且亦智多識廣、百戰百勝固所宜矣、林寳華年來身體發胖、不善奪跑、不耐久戰、日前與林重蘇相遇、劇戰三小時、始獲複賽權、但已筋疲力盡、元氣大傷、昨林雖不憚奔跑、拼命招架、但許以智取、聲東擊西、時遠時近、球出無定、難以捉摸、林終以疲於奔命、甘心屈服、林有時以近球窘敵、但許搶救得法、反弄巧成拙、綜觀全局、盡為許之天下、林得一盤、已屬不易矣、</p>
<p>劇戰開始</p>
<p>林先發球、得勝還朝、繼又以二比一領前、預兆甚佳、滿望一帆風順、直搗黃龍、乃事與願違、許藉發球造成平手、繼又高壓抽擊、頻施壓迫、林一味招架、防守爲難、許取得林之發球局後、一瀉千里、連陞三級、以六比二獲得首盤、第二盤起、許挾戰勝餘威、光芒萬丈、底綫長抽、深入兩角、或沿邊直入、使林挽救不及、林屢以高球窘敵、弄巧成拙、反被許過頂　壓、命中要害、以致又告失守、比數爲六對三、許以二比（）盤</p>
<p>高佔上風</p>
<p>第三盤開始、林鑒於首二盤之慘敗、破釜沉舟、矢志報仇、並變更戰略、用其盒手傑作之斬球制敵、許雖高强、亦一籌莫展、許發球取勝後、被林連得四局、是時林聲勢大盛、風頭一轉、亦爲林之黃金時代、下局許上網攔殺、施其截球神技、扳回一局、此後頻以兩綫底角之抽擊、向林進攻、惟林滿塲奔馳、</p>
<p>奮不顧身</p>
<p>竭力應付、救出險球不少、許則以爲窮寇莫追、不事苛求、遂爲林以六比二奪回一盤、休息片刻、戰事又起、林經劇鬥後、不免疲乏、許則游刃有餘、鎭定非凡、許四記發球、先取一局、旋又以兩角抽球、攻破林之發球局、二比零遙居上風、林奮起反攻、又施斬球故技、奪得一局、許識破奸謀、上網截擊、加倍奉還、以四比一佔</p>
<p>絕對優勢</p>
<p>林見許上網得勝、乃又以高球遠送、時日光耀目、許之高壓、不克奏功、林追成四比二、許即報以顏色、加上一局、成五比二、下局已入肉搏時期、林先已四十對三十勝、但一記野球、造成平手、繼雖上網攔殺、被許猛抽不已、直向底角飛去、林回天乏術、束手無策、二比六結束全局、</p>
<p>邱飛海勝錢耀彬</p>
<p>邱飛海沙塲老將、經騐豐富、惜體力衰弱、、出球無力、即其最拿手之底綫長抽、亦不足以制敵死命、昨戰四川錢耀彬、錢自戰敗爪哇曾端才、奪得複賽權後、聲勢喧赫、後生可畏、昨雖敗北、但臨陣鎭靜、大刀闊斧、時予老邱以極大之威脅、且比數始終接近、固雖敗猶榮也、</p>
<p>邱發球得利、錢照樣回敬、自後你一局我一局、各不相讓、比數並肩而進、直至各五時、邱仍得發球局、而錢突失管東力、野球頻頻、斷送大局、七比五老邱</p>
<p>首吿勝利</p>
<p>第二盤錢不甘雌伏、迭勇力抗、正手抽擊、連建大功、三對零遙遙領前、老邱人老珠黃、奔跑艱難、勉力應付、挽回一局、錢再接再厲、造成五比一之優勝局面、邱雖又得一局、然大勢已去、不可收拾、遂被錢以六比二</p>
<p>造成均勢</p>
<p>第三盤小錢甚形努力、老邱緊緊相隨、專步不離、惟錢因求勝心切、反多野球、致爲邱所乘、連加兩局、錢扳回一局、次局關係是盤勝負、雙方競爭至烈、經七次平等、邱始奪得勝利、而獲第三盤、比數六比三、第四盤錢竭力反抗、欲挽狂瀾於旣倒、但至緊要關頭、總以操之過急、</p>
<p>坐失良機</p>
<p>老邱勝利在握、後勁甚足、三元連中、予小錢一致命傷、錢因之精神渙散、鬥志全無、雖勉强追上數局、但四比二、五比三、一路屈居人下、最後老邱再以六比三獲得决賽權、</p>

<h3>雙打複賽　爪哇淘汰四川　上海馬華今日上午補賽　勝者下午即與爪哇决賽</h3>
<p>男子網球雙打、上海對馬華原定十六日舉行、因單打賽畢、各人精力疲乏、更加天色已晚、雙方同意、改於今日上午九時舉行、上海仍由林寳華邱飛海出塲、馬華則爲林望蘇阮國英、是兩組實力雄厚、各有問新冠軍之可能、屆時必有最精彩最激烈之競爭、</p>
<p>爪哇對四川之戰、日昨比賽三盤、未能了結、四川以二比一佔優、改於昨日上午九時續賽、王文正錢耀彬胸懷大志、滿擬一嗚驚人、擊敗爪哇二許、但心與願違、全因技遜一着、第四盤起、二許一路順風、以峻急之抽擊、及沉重之高壓、使王錢一籌英展、連負五局後、雖急起直追、扳回三局、卒以六比三歸二許勝利、最後决球、四川仍無起色、爪哇又以六比二勝、得决　權、五盤成績如下、</p>
<p>上海馬華複賽之優勝者、即於今日下午與爪哇决賽、</p>

<h3>女子網球　王春菁魏麥谷　得單打决賽權　黃山農陳清一敗塗地</h3>
<p>女子網球單打、昨日下午一時複賽兩組、山西王春菁對南京黃山農、上海魏麥谷對南京陳淸、形勢均成一面倒、尤以晋京之戰、更爲悽慘、結果晋王滬魏奪得决賽權、</p>
<p>晋王春菁</p>
<p>在本屆大會中、一路順風、未遇敵手、迄未失守一盤、京黃山農球藝尙佳、惜大敵當前、臨陣慌張、第一盤尙有競爭各一平手後、王連勝兩君、黃追上一局後、即一蹶不振、遂以六比二失首盤第二盤黃更不景氣、不便無還手能力、即招架亦時現捉襟見肘、全盤結束、僅勝四記、得兩記者一局、一記趙兩局、光局三個、開本屆大會之新紀錄、亦一趣事也、</p>
<p>川爪雙打代表自右至左王文正錢耀彬許承基許承位　（國際及王開攝）</p>
<p>滬魏麥谷</p>
<p>擊法穩健、前勝山西小王、絕非倖致、陳淸爲首都健將、球技亦尙可觀、惜體力較差、不能耐久、第一盤魏取攻勢、旗開得勝、馬到成功、陳僅左支右架、毫無還手、繼雖振作精神、奪回數局、終以三比六先負一盤、第一盤陳更覺不支、魏則操縱自如、鋒芒更健、陳僅奪得一局、以一比六再告失守、魏遂獲得决賽權、</p>
<p>女子單打形勢</p>
<h3>女子籃球　福建隊身矮力弱　廣東苦戰獲决賽權　上海大勝江蘇五十八對四　滬粵二隊今下午四時決賽</h3>
<p>獲得女子籃球複賽權之上海、江蘇、廣東、福建四隊、於昨日下午二時起、分別舉行複賽、首塲上海逢江蘇、結果江蘇逈非上海敵手、以四對五十八大敗次塲爲廣東對福建、雙方競爭至烈、分數此起彼落、福建隊員身材矮小、吃虧不少、結果於最後五分鐘內爲上海連進數球、以三十四對四十失去决賽權、獲得决賽權之上海廣東兩隊、定今日下午四時决賽、依據本屆歷次比賽成績觀之、上海隊奪標希望、有八分把握、複賽被掏汰之江蘇福建兩隊、則定於今日上午十時爭奪三四名地位、福建勝江蘇、可不成問題、如廣東爲上海所敗、則福建與廣東尙須接戰一次、以定亞軍地位、昨戰結果如後、</p>
<h3>上海大勝江蘇　江蘇免吃鴨蛋</h3>
<p>上海江蘇兩女子籃球隊、於昨日下午二時舉行複賽、江蘇隊自一戰而勝北平後、聲威爲之一振、昨日戰極銳利之上海隊、吾人固料其必敗、然决不料其竟敗得若是之凄慘、徐碧雲之投籃、平時尙見準確、昨日竟失常態、罰球五次、一次未中、上海隊尙一度以候補軍應戰、蘇隊亦不能稍挽頽勢、全局中任人宰割、束手無策、趙連貞黃連珍、於上下半時獲實貴之四分、免吃鴨蛋、其餘盡係滬軍天下、四十分鐘結果、陳家將面不紅、氣不喘、寫寫意意、以五十八對四、奪得决賽權、</p>

<h3>粵軍苦戰勝閩　最後五分定勝負</h3>
<p>粵閩之戰、則絕非蘇滬之戰可比、是設也、戰雲彌天、殺聲震地、空氣緊張、人人興喬、眞如小說書上所謂、棋逢敵手、將遇良材、分數此起彼落、直至最後三分鐘、廣東隊達中數球、四十對三十四、福建慘遭淘汰、詳情如後、</p>
<p>先聲奪人</p>
<p>二時旣屆、兩軍跳躍而出、觀衆迎之以掌、裁判員舒鴻、發下動員令、中綫跳球、三五傳遞、廣東後衛犯規、閩中將林素卿、首先一罰而中、粵鋒黃慧兒、玉臂一揮、球入籃園、雙着守太嚴、同時犯規、各獲一分後、容羨各大施身手、三球連中、以十對三佔先閩軍急宣告停戰、許心喜見球心喜、兩擲均中、林素卿罰球準確、亦獲三分、追成八對七、不旋踪又爲廣隊所乘、首節十二對七、粵軍先聲奪人、</p>
<p>後來居上</p>
<p>第二節中、閩隊後防稍已更動、佈置較前整齊、林素卿與師勤王、許前鋒雪中送炭、容羨紅悄然離塲、粵鋒頓失重心、廈門姑姐瑞屏、連續犯規、林中鋒球上有眼、直奔籃心、反以二分超分、轉戰多時、休息時届、閩隊以十九對十七、小勝上半時、</p>
<p>四百公尺接力第一北平隊　（王開及國際攝）</p>
<p>難解難分</p>
<p>檸檬橘子食罷、十分鐘瞬息而過、黃慧見的是可兒、兩次攻破敵籃、許心喜惡運頻臨、侵規被罰出塲、吳仙玉由後調任前鋒、實力大受影響、容家羨紅、東山再起、春門見喜、閩隊何甘落後、分數平均　增、四週掌聲雷動、直殺得難解難分戰成各二十五平手以後、到瑪琍再中兩球、閩軍亦有所獲、以二十八分對三十、稍已見屈、</p>
<p>功虧一簣</p>
<p>最後一節、為雙方生死關頭、各出死力以拼、吳仙玉得後方來球、不辱命、又成平等、至此彼長此落、分數由各三十二而至同罰犯規、黃慧兒一罰中的、吳　兒蓮心慌意亂未塲入籃、球爲對方所奪、容羨紅冉現顏色、兩球均告命中、全塲呼聲如雷、閩方軍心搖動、手不應心、無何　聲一響、福建小姐、玉容失色、竟以六分之差、慘遭淘汰、</p>
<p>球藝槪評</p>
<p>閩南姑娘、昨日之敗、非敗於技術之不如、實收軍材矮小、體力之不及、跳球每已吃虧、粵軍身高力壯、時用高球傳遞、務閩隊無可　何、搶球時閩隊、每翻身倒地、昨日所跌觔斗、不知若干、論合作及戰略、閩實較粵爲優、林素卿許心喜搶刦投籃、頗有獨到之處、粵方以容羨各爲最出色、黃慧兒劉瑪琍亦頗强悼、惟全隊之聯絡、尙覺未至純熟　地、今日戰上海、恐難取勝也、</p>
<p>啼笑皆非</p>
<p>福建女子籃球盛對素著、上屆全運、轉戰至决賽、最後以一分之差敗於滬隊、賽後全兪隊昌、抱頭大吳不止、昨日又以可勝之局面、不幸見挫於廣東、比賽終了後、該隊員許心喜趙阿玉林秀臺等、不竟悲從中來於籃球房內、暗泣不止、即未垂淚者、亦痴若木鷄、如失貴珍、惘然不知所措、廣東隊則雀躍三十、鷄呼雷動、一喜一悲、一館之內、一塲之中、而氣候不齊、</p>

<p>男子舉重决賽、除輕量組已於前日比賽完畢外、尙有中量組次重組重量組、均於昨晨舉行完畢、參加人數極少、重量組原有二人、其中一人棄權、故此組僅有一人、即馬來亞選手黃社基、但爲仍努力、造成三組中最高之紀錄、其他兩組之冠軍、亦悉爲馬來亞選手所包辦、蓋各組雖有北方數省選手之參加、而北方選手、其臂力原亦不能算小、但以舉重方法之不同、以致較次、中有豫選手海全祥、在挺舉時、其所增重量、與馬來亞潠手黃社基相差甚少、蓋挺舉在方法上較爲自由、而其他提舉推舉與我國之舉石檐亦有不同處、且多約束、以致成績上不無較差、</p>

<h3>卅二軍　馬球隊昨表演</h3>
<p>分紅黃兩隊黃隊以八對上獲勝　下星期在江灣與西人比賽四塲</p>
<p>久著盛名之第卅二軍馬球隊、於昨日下午三時、在大會運動塲　次表演、滬上人士咸欲一擴眼界觀此　興球術、故觀衆頗形踴躍、表演分紅黃兩隊、歷一小時、精彩百出、結果黃隊以八對上　　、茲　詳情如次、</p>
<p>英雄氣概</p>
<p>出塲表演者其有八人、分作紅黃兩隊各　黃角長統皮靴、百馬褲、戴白　盆帽、紅隊　　　紅　　　　、黃隊上衣　黃翻領運動衣、背上有三十二軍記號、左襟綴一馬形、人人具有英雄氣概、</p>
<p>競走冠軍蔡正老達到終點</p>
<p>壯馬馴服</p>
<p>兩隊各備馬八匹、以四匹替換乘坐、馬尾挿以紅黃色標熾、馬頸下亦有紅黃彩綢、在未賽前、馬上各披紅黃綢布、有馬夫十六人、在塲照料、各馬壯健異常、且有良好之訓練、故頗為馴服、</p>
<p>比賽情形</p>
<p>塲地較大於足球塲、球門無橫木、柱上圍以白布、頂挿紅旗兩面、每隊作戰者四人、兩任前鋒兩任後衛、共比賽六次、每次賽六分鐘、即休息三分鐘、以打鈴爲號、每勝一球、即交換方向作戰、裁判員童震、亦騎白馬、往來馳騁、馬上並掛球囊、隨時應用、</p>
<p>黃隊獲勝</p>
<p>三時開賽、各騎士跨上馬鞍、雙方環球塲半圈、至中綫列隊、裁判員由中綫擲出一球、雙方開始鏖戰、各以丁字式棒、猛力擊球、球甚小、馬不動、故擊球頗難、非具有功夫者萬難應付、第一局二對零黃勝、第二局一對一平局、第三局一對零紅勝、第四局三對二黃勝、第五局一對一平局、第六局二對一紅勝、結果八對上黃隊勝名單如下、</p>
<p>紅隊　郭廷智　閻學儀　李培智　張應龍</p>
<p>黃隊　李麟炳　楊桂芳　韓樹芬　龐馥延</p>
<p>對抗西人</p>
<p>該隊已約定本市西人馬球隊、於本月　一、二十三、二十六、二十八、下午三時在江灣跑馬塲比賽、尤以二十六日一塲最爲精神、願我滬上人士屆時前往、一觀鏖戰也</p>
<h3>入塲券　仍照定價出售</h3>
<p>此次全運會自開幕以來、已經八日、秩序良好、每日票價均照規定之　分別出售、乃近有不肖之徒、有以購得之　抬價轉賣他人者、被大會稽查察出後、已送公安局法辦、至大會票價、無論何種入塲券、除上海市銀行及中國旅行社代售外、其餘均在售票亭發售、絕無臨時加價兜售之理、觀衆以後如遇此情事、可隨時報　拘究云</p>

<p>會塲觀衆這幾日已全部擠到游泳池去了、昨日網球塲上因有爪滬之戰尙稱熱鬧、籃球房中與田徑塲上間直冷靜得四座皆空、與第一日相較、　不知相去若干哩、</p>

<p>秋已深老、天氣漸寒、女選手們客窗無事、相率持毛絨、添識寒衣、遠坐之、不管一幅美人圖畫、頗能耐九尋味、</p>
<p>國術女選手、皆糾糾如武夫、而射箭手右抱明月、左托泰山、巾幗而有鬆眉氣概、十三妹不得專美於前矣、</p>
<p>王開照相館、攝有全套全運照片、携歸贈送故人、為絕妙之紀念物、故各選手往購者、保形踴躍也、其他如勤奮書局等之各種體育讀物、日來銷路亦佳、蓋亦送禮之妙品也、</p>

<h3>陵汴賣書記</h3>
<p>— 寒峯</p>
<p>「文明小史」第二十四回，曾經說到一個到濟南趕考的書商，說他是「一位大維新的豪傑」，八股出身，做過幾年名秀才，只因常常出外遊學，「居然是位維新的領袖·「他這回去　書，自己也下考塲。事後並作了一部「濟南賣書記」。李伯元很醜惡的把他列傳了一番。當時讀過，我很懷疑是有所指，但捉不定他指的究是誰個。</p>
<p>後來看「癸卯新民叢報彙編」，見目中有「讀金陵　書記」一文，乃恍然大悟。據叢報稱，此書不知何人作，說作者是「有學者，能文者，愛國者，」評此書爲「雖小篇亦見精神」。並徵引論小說，論翻譯，寫考生各段，以見其內容。當時頗有一讀之念，顧無緣得到。</p>
<p>後來「來靑閣」書目出版，查有此册，並「汴梁賣書記」一種下著梁啟超著，乃欣喜欲狂，及至去買，竟已爲人購去。嗣後常以不得見此書爲恨。最近過「粹寶齋」，見主人床頭，竟有「汴梁賣書記」一冊，因詢其曾否收到「金陵賣書記」。主人謂，「有是有，但不知放到何處去。」因重托之，然仍恐到不得手也。直到日昨，親與主人翻檢歷數小時，始得之於亂書堆中，其快慰之情：殆可見矣。</p>
<p>書非梁啟超作也，署名公奴，就其內容觀之，大約是那時的「開明書店」的主人。李伯元所著，實是影射此君，事實自多臆造。「金陵記」一卷，上寫各種書發賣情形，及所以暢銷滯銷之優點缺點「爲輸入文明者較準其方針」。下則寫考生在塲内外種種生活狀態，及學識大略，「以示社會之現狀」。所叙年代，是光緒二十八年壬寅（一九〇二）。「汁梁記」是翌年所作，分三卷，上爲賣書情形，中爲旅程志，下爲人物志。書里曾說到「金陵記」，僞托此書是友人所作：</p>
<p>「金陵賣書記，友人某去年所誌，描寫內地社會情狀，頗極妙肖。於此間爲非賣品，遇有記中相似人物，輒投之以當藥石，旬日間指索甚衆。或稱其學問之博，或贊其筆墨之工，其轉語則比之禹鼎，未免太酷云云。然用爲開聲利器，却無過是。一日，有客昂然入，揀閱書數十種，隨手一揭，即云不好，置之·又揭一書亦如之。余友應櫃者，亦孝廉也，詢以何科。大聲答曰：甲午。閱書如故。其胸中舉人二字，膨脹已臻極頂，故外形亦龐然而不覺。繼而選定書數種，問曰：有無折否？答以無。則鼻應日哼。又問：能欠乎？答以不能。又應曰哼。聲益厲，同人知其非藥不靈也，急以金陵賣書記進。客受而問價，答以非賣品，遂與同來者並觀之。未及數行，兩人相顧語，蠻鴃不可辨。忽擲書汗赧而遁。」</p>
<p>兩記內容，即此一例可知。蓋亦是譴責之作。書雖均短小，有兩點是極可稱的。其一，是關於考生生活思想及種種醜態的暴露。其二，是從「生意眼」的一點上以見運動的進展及其缺陷。二記並不是怎樣了不起的書，但能使後來的人，能以看到當時文化方面的部分形象，這是可貴的。「新民叢報」的批評，却是注意於一借鏡」的一點。</p>
<p>譬如「金陵記」的論小說：「小說書亦不銷者，於小說體裁多不合也。不失賭直，即失諸略，不失諸高，即失諸。筆墨不足副其宗旨，讀者不能得小說之樂趣也。即有極力爲典雅之文者，要於詞章之學相去尙遠，塗澤滿紙，只覺可厭，不足動人也·今新小說界中，若黑奴籲天錄，若新民報之十五小豪傑，吾可以百口保其必銷。經國美談次之。然龍溪固小說家之雄，如所撰浮城物語者得詞章家以評之，必有偉觀·」而在後兩節中，則評爲「今之爲小說者，俗話所謂開口便見喉嚨，又安能動人。」都可看到作者怎樣從「生意眼」上來論學。其說翻譯書歷史書的缺點，尤其深到處。最有趣的，是寫考生以如何的姿態來買生理學諸書：</p>
<p>「……一見其圖，喜躍不自己。然惟恐人之見之也，故來購必以暮夜。避師友，屏羣從，伺人少時以隻身來。其擇取之也，指以手，而口不取道也。稍高者則目之爲閒書，意若謂可有可無，取以銷永日耳。……」一派腐儒的神氣，寫得眞是活現。然在另一面所呈現的，却又是一種姿態：「考棚街上之考先生，大莫與京，等無可對者也。其招搖過市時，一服所抹倒者，皆市儈也。一其橫行又可見。故此書之末，有考生五變六變，塲內塲外生活素描，以窮形極詆。至彼等對新學之了解，是於「時務通考」外，一無所知，便是「時務通考一，也大都不曾讀過。</p>
<p>如「金陵記」所說：「李鴻章康南海二書，最足起其疑問。見者輒大詫曰：何謂李鴻章？告之曰：其傳也。則何以無傳字。搖首咋舌不自已。「又如：「一日，，有以亞東地球全圖問者，有客在座，爲之鬨堂。其人始則赧然，旣而曰：吾確見報上有此書名，諒爾店無此物耳。頷之乃去。」甚至「有指寗波香港而問爲何解者，」其可笑可憐蓋得以見矣。叢報對「金陵記」加以讚揚，是確有可讚之處的。</p>
<p>「金陵記」以寫考生生活為最好，「汴梁記」則特寫了考生購書的酸態，擴大一點說，就是更詳的寫了賣書的情形。甚至爲想節省一文錢，不惜僞作窮窘，哀告求乞，或告貸鄰家，搶盡徑走。篇首所舉大肚「舉人，」亦是此種人物之一。而兩記相較，亦可見江南確比北方開通得多。「汴梁記」有一則寫買書的情形道：</p>
<p>「凡閱書目，大半如讀東觀書，亦不辨書中部類，隨指一書取閱，以兩手合書，從中間翻頭展，左右顧視，一展輒數頁，即隨書掩閣，又指索別卷，亦如之。少或數種，多則十餘種，或歷數分鐘久，或一小時，叩以究欲何書，又　愕不知所對。求一先看叙文目錄者，十不得一二。及選定何書，則斤斤論價，以爲必有折扣。因此不成而去者，日必數起。」</p>
<p>那邊的考生大概是如此的，對新書殊少興味。也就因此，作者遂不得不改變計劍，專寫那邊考生買書醜態，蓋無法「藉茲考察，以資改革一也。兩書相較，以「金陵記」爲優，其顯示之社會性極强，而不像一汁梁記」着眼於「旅程，」「友朋，」較强於私生活。我終幸得見此册以見當時情形。如此輩中人有存者，目擊四十年來世界之進展，再重讀此編，回想當時對「新學」之驚訝，不知其將如何啞然抑嗟歎呢！</p>
<h3>雨聲</h3>
<p>— 陳琳</p>
<p>秋夜的雨聲是悲切的。讀到『秋風多，雨如和，簾外芭蕉三兩窠，夜長人奈何！』的詞句，我們自然會有一陣哀凉之感！然而有秋風送着的秋雨，音調是熱鬧的，音色是明朗的，雖是秋風送不盡秋雨，然聽着一陣陣嘯呌奔騰　聲音，所領受的苦味仍可說是生動的苦味！春夜的雨聲是清麗的！『夜來風雨聲，花落知多少！』雨的音色非特十分鮮艷，想到明朝的落花滿徑，燕翦紅泥的情境，連夢影也滲入微笑了。祇有夏夜中梅雨的滴聲，闇淡陰鬱，纔是有極度的凄凉味的！旣沒有驚破沉悶的輕雷，連雨外的籟聲也聽不到。波浙波浙地只管滴着，沒有風，沒有動，沒有停期的單調的聲音，織成一面憂鬱的網，蓋上灰色的希望。</p>
<p>像這般充滿着灰聲的苦味的雨聲，我想就是天才的妙筆，也難借着形象的媒介把牠道出。</p>
<p>在月下哀呌着簫聲，雖會使　婦隨着中夜的眼淚，但畢　一總有月色，雲光，說不定還有倚樓的翠袖，一切都是在蕩着淸麗的影子。杜宇的苦唱，可算是凄絕，但生命至死使算完了，痛苦解脫了，詩人濟慈歌頌死，且把死看做一種永生，一種無盡的快樂。死原是沒有什麽可怕的。只有夏夜的淋聲，絲絲滴滴，波浙波浙地下着，人像臥在蒸籠中的一粒饅頭，心　然活着，但呼吸却被煩悶窒息了，實在此摸上萬　的蜀道還絕望，比　竄進遼闇的幽靈的國土還可怖。</p>
<p>整個天地的空間，都滴滿着煩悶的聲音，沒有一絲漏隙。更進而滴入我的肉膣，我的血管，我的靈魂的深處。凡是雨聲滴到的地方，煩悶的波浪也趕着漲到。我忽然想到我家園的幾株牽牛花，此際雖當在盛開時候，但怕也給這雨聲滴碎，在煩悶的波中憔悴了！我的姊妹的基碣，怕也給雨淋倒，荒山寂寞，她那無依的孤靈，要向何處躱避呢？</p>
<p>在生命力充滿着的當兒，我還能排去悲觀，想着自己也是靑斗，果能苦幹去下，或許也可做點人類需要的工作。但現在蜷臥在這煩悶的雨聲中，我眞禁不住這悲感的襲聲！</p>
<p>我戰慄着，眼角突然蠕動着兩道冰冷的液體。</p>
<h3>寓言</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>在「托爾斯泰自白」中有一段很好的寓言，這高言如用來形容我們這時代的人，是再好沒有的了。他說：</p>
<p>「一個旅行者在野原裏爲一猛獸追襲，趕緊逃入一枯井中，但看見井底有個毒龍，張牙欲噬。這不幸的旅人，不敢往外爬，恐怕給猛獸毀滅，又不敢向下躍，恐怕給毒龍吞噬，只是緊緊地抓住井隙間長着的小樹枝。他的手漸漸乏力了，他覺得快要給上面的或下面的惡獸毀滅了，但他仍然抓着。接着他看見兩個小鼠，一黑一白，在那小枝的莖上轉來轉去，而且咬着它。小枝快要被咬斷，他快要落於龍的爪牙中了，他看見了知道無可倖免了。這時，他向周圍張望，看見小枝的葉上有幾點蜂蜜，他就用舌舐它。」</p>
<p>依我看來，這實在不是一個寓言，誰都知道這是眞實的事，尤其是現在一般人的眞實的情况。</p>
<p>上有猛獸，下有毒龍，當中有老鼠咬他攀住的小樹枝，說不定那時小樹枝就斷了，在這千鈞一髮之際，他反而沒有什麽恐怖了，知道了自己的必然的命運。這時發現了一點蜂蜜，倒很放心的去舐一舐，知道不舐也是白不舐，自己總是要墜下井去，被毒龍吃了的，那還不如趁　着在未墜下去的一剎那，來　一點甜的滋味，雖然這種享樂也就僅是一剎那。</p>
<p>我們的時代，我們的環境，是不是像猛獸與毒龍，這我不必下這個斷言。但我敢斷言的是我們這時代不需要暫時舐蜂蜜的人，雖然我們的命運已經注定是斷送給猛獸和毒龍，但我們不妨走上去和猛獸拼一下，或下到井裏跟毒龍打一塲，雖然我們是要給它撕成粉碎的，但這樣死，總比馴順的死好一點，或者可以不死而得着一條生路。</p>
<p>我們這時代不需要暫時舐蜂蜜，以後很馴　把性命斷送給毒龍猛獸的人！</p>
<h3>某夜（下）</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>從男女兩人的話語中，我猜得出這三個人是安徽人，一定是從那方面逃來的。不錯，安徽的水災不小。可是，像女人所說的行行好事可讓我怎麽行法呢？以我個人來說，雖然近來算是找到個夜工作着，算是有個職業，但這事也是有今天不知明天的。而且，就算我能够買得起，我這孤身漢又有什麽理由買一個孩子多添麻煩！我將怎樣養活他？孩子跟我不是更受罪麼。一個失去母親的孩子，他是再也不會好生長養的。再說，就算我對他們行了好事，買下孩子，可是那果眞可以就救了他們？未必見得。和他們同罹水災的難民，不知，有多少，縱然救了他們三人，還不是救不了別人！不行，我沒有辦法。我沒有話說。我却在搖頭表示着我愛莫能助的遺憾。</p>
<p>他們大概起初對我的希望很大，但是我這種表示太使他們失望了，男人的眼光頽傷的低下去，死釘釘地釘着地面不動一動；女人失望地望着孩子的臉，隨即把臉貼上孩子的臉上。</p>
<p>我爲什麼不是一個大善士呢？不是我可以救濟救濟他們麽。可是眞牌的大善士們的眼睛，恐怕又沒有機會讓他們看到這樣一幅的黎民圖吧？</p>
<p>「先生」，那男人又開口了，伸手摸摸孩子乾瘦的小手。」你眞不能行行好事麽？唉！這世界好人太少了。先生，沒有這個孩子走到那里全好辦，大人可以挨冷受餓，孩子就挨不了，吵呌得你心像刀割般痛。沒法子，不願眼看着孩子跟着受罪，就想賣了他罷，賣給人家也許還有碗飯吃着。」停一停，他似又想起了別的事情，望望女人的身上。「還有個藥根呢，先生，不看她肚子又大了麽？人越窮，孩子越來的快，眞不知這里面有什麽道理。」</p>
<p>我的脚步怎也挪不動了，就像生了兩支釘，牢牢地釘在地里面。我忘記自己的行程了。我想起當地的救災事業來，這不是給他們找到了出路了麼？我問道：</p>
<p>「你們沒有到救濟會去麼？那里該有個辦法罷。」</p>
<p>這也是我在報紙上看到的，我怕他們不知道本地還有這麼一個慈善團體，告訴他們去請求救濟。男人說他昨天剛剛離開那里，里面也沒有好法，只是把難民一船船遺送回籍，停在那里是不允許的。原籍遭水一無所有，回去還不是一樣挨餓，要回去，當初又何必逃出來！我問他有沒有發錢，他說錢沒有，只發船票，船上有飯，不上船，不回家，就得離開那里，那里不收容白住白吃的人。</p>
<p>這時洋房里忽然傳出無綫電的聲響。「好哥哥」「好妹妹」的唱着，還有年靑女人在學唱。寂靜的夜攪破了。男人和女人直着眼睛聽着，好像那里面有什麽東西足以使他們忘記了飢餓！他們完全忘記了身前還有一個我！他們聽什麼呢？果然是在欣賞音樂麽？他們的眼眶里爲什麽又流出眼淚來，一滴一滴的？……</p>
<h3>天問</h3>
<p>— 凡海</p>
<p>縱使父老弟妹們一旦相見，一塲歡笑下，怕也解不了重重的愁懷！就說看見了相思那麼久的她，怕也只徒然羞紅了臉，急壞了心胸，一股兒氣喘，在忘我的陶醉裏，還不是再打開淸醒的眼？……走過來的旅路記不淸多少長，看背後自己留下的脚印那樣重苦，才知道赤裸的足板已經又裂又厚，這還不已够了麽？爲什麽又甘心把自己的煩慮當作第一個記號刻在她那淸澄而無猜的額上？幾年之後，是將什麽放在她的手臂上？</p>
<h3>名譽老婆婆（十）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鈞譯</p>
<p>『我也這麽想。這完全是皇上的福蔭。眞不敢當。南無阿彌陀佛，南無阿彌陀佛。』</p>
<p>不久，遺骨運到了·據說，老婆婆就把它放在生病的丈夫和自己中間，跟活人一般地抱着睡了一夜。</p>
<p>殯葬的時候，鎭中重要的人物都集攏來了，各各親切地照拂着一切。這當兒，燒飯老婆婆就完全像在發熱病一般地，喧嚷地噪鬧着，有時亂說話，有時高聲大笑。突然，她不曉得想起了什麽，就買了許多點心，把附近許多窘孩子集攏到門外，將點心分給他們吃。</p>
<p>『喂，你們大家，』她似乎很滿足地眺望着孩子們在貪婪地吃着她所給與的點心，說：『長大了都要做個了不起的人物。都要跟我　兒子勇造般地做個了不起的軍人，爲着國家服務。唔，你們曉得名譽這回事嗎？不曉得名譽這回事的，簡直不是人。嘿，我還要把許多點心給你們吃，做個了不起的人吧。現在老婆婆已經是個有錢人了。你們恐怕還不曉得吧，我已經從政府那邊領到了一筆三百兩的大欵子。這完全是叨勇造的福。你們現在能够這樣地領到點心吃也是叨勇造的福。曉得了嗎？嘿？』</p>
<p>接着，她還把剩下來的點心撒到路上去；含着眼淚，笑嘻嘻地眺望着孩子們嘩啦嘩啦地在那兒把它搶起來吃。</p>
<p>伴靈的晚上，老婆婆又拿出那「貓皮」，在人們的羣集當中胡亂地彈了起來。她還唱着種種的歌兒，歌詞和腔調都是亂來的。述極潦亮的歌兒她也公然高聲地唱了起來。並且，她還時常張大着一張紅嘴巴哈哈地哄笑着。這時候，在門前，就黑壓地站滿了人。</p>
<p>「貓皮」的聲響約模繼續了一個　點左右。接着，老婆婆就在紙門後而隱去了；一會兒她却穿着一套不曉得從什麽地方借　　軍服出現在大家的跟前。功六級的金　勳章在胸前燦然地發亮。</p>
<p>但是，頭髮蓬亂的老婆婆穿着軍服的姿態，實在是怪形怪狀的。而且，對於那套軍服，她那貧弱滖頽的身體也未免過於瘦小。她的兩手和兩足完全隱藏在衣服裏面，每跑一步，那寬闊的衣服裏面的手足就一動一動的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>為三房客說幾句話</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>本山减低房租委員會，爲力促實現六折减租，於前日發表二次官言，並開始總動員，要求各商號住戶簽字，準備推派代表，晋京向六中全會請願。行見本市减租運動，得實現其减　目的，以解除市民房租負担的痛苦。</p>
<p>减租運動，是誰都應該表示同情的。因爲這是全上海市民一致的要求。然當這運動熱烈進行之時，我們尙有一點疑問，卽减租運動，共所代表的，是全市的房客呢還是一部分的二房東而已？依情理言，减租運動，旣是全市民一致的要求，其所代表，應是前者，而非後者。但從减租運動的行動看，則所謂减租　動，似乎只有代表一般　舖及二房東，而於三房客，却未曾提及。這實是一個最大的缺陷。</p>
<p>我　要知道，本市租屋居住者，除商舖及二房東外，尙有所謂三房客。而房租的負担，直接是二房東，間接到是三房客。老實說，上海負高貴房租的重担者，只有佔全居民多數的三房客。一部分二房東，大都是住屋不出租的。若善於經營者，屋上架房，　怕還有餘利。故减租運動，如僅代表二房東，實是不澈底的。須述二房客也包括在内，才能普記，才於大多數市民有益。</p>
<p>或者有人說，二房東向大房東要求减租，大房東的房租一减低，不但二房東受其賜，卽三房客　沾其利。因爲二房東所要求的目的一達，對於三房客的房租，自然也可以减低。這話似說得不錯，可定事卻並不如此。例如本市自减租運動發生以後，房產業者之只知圖利，不顧大局者，固居多數。而深明情勢，自動减租者，　不乏人。然减租的結果，二房東的負担果然减輕，三房客却仍須出昻貴的房租。其間卽有少數减租者，所减也屬微少。</p>
<p>故我們以爲减租運動，應是普遍的。大房東的房租「减低，二房東的房租，也須隨之而减低。如此才能眞正减輕本市全體居民的負担。否則减租的要求，只於一部分二房東有益，於大多數三房客，卻沒有多大的彩響。</p>
<h3>殘秋</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>早晨挾了一本書，踱進了公園裏面，踏着落滿黃葉的草徑，在疏林裏走着；目家兒的心境正和這肅殺的秋天一樣地沉鬱，一樣地感傷。我常常望着那天外薄薄的白雲嘆息着。週遞是只有哀愁，沒有歡樂；現實的環境正象徵着我整個的命運，因爲我的生命中只有秋天了啊！</p>
<p>偶然看見人家對我注視一下，但我覺得這鋒利的眼光似乎有一種譏諷在對準我射擊。使我害怕，使我慚愧，所以近來卽是親戚朋友我也很有點兒不願看見；因爲他們全會用那鋒利的目光向我射擊的。</p>
<p>獨自個兒坐到園角池畔的一隻露椅上去，翻閱着一本「魯迅雜感選集一，勉强看了半頁，便把它扔了。將肢體沉重地算在椅子背上，仰首望着那澄淸平靜的天，天是那末晴和的，倒像個四月裏的天氣。這時有幾隻小鳥往上面樹梢頭掠過，觸動了那些枝頭，籟落落的飄下一張枯葉來，它恰巧又跌落在我面上，我便下意識地將它捏在手中一揉，就變了粉碎。</p>
<p>——是殘秋了呵！日子眞太容易過去了，只一雲眼，一個秋天又在我生命中悄悄地飛了過去，然而冬天不是又要跑來了嗎？我見冬天比秋天更怕，因爲我沒有方法來應付這寂寞的，悠長的冬天啊！</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>二十多個可貴的秋天是這樣平凡地，毫無代價的逝了過去，眞似流水一樣，永遠也不會回來了。</p>
<p>從椅子上站起身來，拾起那本書，默默地沿着池邊走去，池中的殘荷，已經剩了幾張不完整的焦葉，怪憔悴可憐地徜在水面上，草上的露珠却在太陽底下一閃一閃地耀光。</p>
<p>園中是那麽地靜寂，雖然還有幾個人在那兒散步，但都同我一樣的沒有話語。枝頭上突然飛來了幾對小鳥，牠們吱吱唧唧的噪着，仿彿代表我們在嗚不平；於是那靜穆的空氣也似乎被攪起了一種小小的波動。</p>
<p>——是殘秋了呵！冬天該要跟着來了吧！</p>
<p>秋天它像一個龍鍾的老人，它一來，就會使你意識到這一年的命運卽將快要終了，然而冬天更如老人患了第三期的肺結核，可以等待着它的壽命逝去。</p>
<p>走出了公園，茫茫然的在街頭亂闖着，一顆心是已像失去歸宿的孤鳥般的徬徨着，自己也不明白該往那兒去見好</p>
<h3>堤上</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>病中的生活是寂寞的，孤獨的，三個月居住在這人地生疏的幽僻的鄕間，把那難挨的日子打發過去，如同有三年那樣長。有時在夕陽西下的時候，慢步堤上，望着那一輪血盆的落日漸漸被河心吞沒，我聲乎疑惑自己是生活在這世界之外了。</p>
<p>到鄉間來的時候，正是知了高唱入雲之時，瞬眼三個月了，聽着楓葉的枯葉在堤上發出一陣陣悉索的聲音，我沒來由地感到自己是被人們遺忘在這角落里了。</p>
<p>剛才到鄕間，從囂雜的環境中逃脫出來，這里的一草一木，都引起我的好威，好像我所渴望的生活就在目前了，秋天生點小病，有人是這樣贊美過的，那末，我應該利用這難得的機會享受這小病所賜與我的一切。</p>
<p>居處是三間平屋，分臥室，書房，起居室，如果懸掛一點字畫，製辦點麽登傢具，像模像樣地佈置起來，約二三知己，吟詩幾首，敲琴一曲，或許要感覺得三個月是過得太快了。我僅帶了隨手幾件簡單的行囊，不够一間臥室的打扮，所以被我稱為書房和起居室的實在是徒有其名而已。在我搬來後的一個月，鄰居大興土木，說是爲他兒子完婚而特地工興築鳩的，於是那兩間屋子就被借作作塲，每天擊木之擊，吵擾不能使我午睡，但是和木匠們撩撩天，他們像小孩子一樣率直，天眞，到解除了寂寞的歲月。</p>
<p>平屋面對着長堤，如果是樓房的話，你可以開了窗，憑在窗橋上，早晨看太陽從河心里升起來，晚上盼着點點漁舟的歸帆，鄉間自有鄉間的幽美了。但是屋子臨面是成行的楓樹，屋主人的意思是避蔭在烈日當空的時候，這三間平屋簡直照不到一點太陽，想讀一點書，或打一個午睡，那是再幽靜適合沒有的了。我郤不願把自己關在屋子里，醫生也需要我多多運動，對於這長堤我就十分愛好了，我甚至幻想把這一列楓樹削平。</p>
<p>據說這長堤就是把河底的泥土翻起來的，這泥土的灌養十分豐富，慢步在堤上，如同踏着輕鬆的野鴨絨一般。一陣小雨之後，堤上彷彿要勾引你的脚步似的，往往慢慢地向前走去，忘了自己屋子的方向。一邊望着脚下湧擁的浪花向堤脚打來，有時那些水沫一如噴泉一樣打到自家的脚邊，於是擔憂着不要一失足跌下去，其實是永遠不會發生的事。卽使眞的跌到江里，在沙邊上洗個澡，或是在水里浸上半嚮，對於我們的身體到是有莫大的益處的。不過鄉人不會利用這天然的游泳塲，否則，這小小鄉鎭，在夏天到來的時侯，也要和莫干山靑島那樣地見之於廣告了。</p>
<p>我每天早上，戴了大凉帽，比我肩膀還要寬闊的大凉帽，支一枝籐杖，趿在拉鞋向東去，很多時候是在堤上把帶着的食品作爲午餐的。有一次偶然在離屋很遠的地方發現有一段堤榻毀了，我就坐在那里，赤脚蕩到河心去，讓那擊濺的浪花冲着我的脚，有說不出的愉快之後，我幾乎每天在那里打發寂寞的日子。</p>
<p>現在，秋深了，中午時候我還在堤上散步，但是風雨連朝，悶居在屋子里，從樹隙間望到堤上去，那些美麗的浪花，漁舟點點，都引不起我的好感了。瞧着一片片的枯葉從樹頂跌下來，跟着無情的秋風在半空中打着盤旋，慢慢地墮到河心去；彷彿自己也是被人們遺忘在這角落里了。</p>
<p>鄰居的樓房已巍然地矗立在堤畔了，我再找不到一個可以撩撩天的同志，於是我提了行囊向長堤告別。</p>
<h3>港</h3>
<p>— 貝華</p>
<p>港水靜靜地流，從高凸的地方望下來你會感覺得那是一條長而且彎曲的衣帶。它穿過叢林，掠過杉木橋，在拐角處吹哨着南國草原的調子，一直往無止境的前面流下去了。</p>
<p>近叢林的深處，港水的顏色在林蔭下面失去了光澤，黃澄澄地，有的時候却也滲透着濃綠，那大槪是因爲水的深度異樣的利害的緣故吧。就在這里的岸邊，有一株很大的樹，密密的葉子遮住了炎烈的太陽。我喜歡到這里來坐着，聽深深的港灣底音樂；往港的那邊望去，是無邊的廣闊的天野。人的心境會在這種風景的前面完全變換過來的；我非常滿足於這里的生活，而那邊不想回到都會的懷抱里去。</p>
<p>有一個年紀在六十歲以上。健全的老人常常走過這里，像是上什麽地方去的樣子。他的背微微地有點屈，頭髮差不多完全白了，還留了一撮鬍子；不時一面模撫着一面走路。如果我在這里停留得久一些的話，還能够碰見他踽踽地走回來。大槪是走了不少的路吧，他喘着氣，帶着疲勞邊在這樹下休憇着，把他的背靠着樹幹。我回轉頭來，他微笑地對着我招呼了：</p>
<p>「大孩子，你還在這里哪。」</p>
<p>他叫我做大孩子。這是很有趣的，我用一種友誼的熊度和他交談起來。</p>
<p>「從那里來的呢？」我問。</p>
<p>「我天天都到菜市塲去的；天天邊在這半路上瞧見你。你知道邦加嗎——他是我的兒子，在菜塲里做人家的助手。」</p>
<p>「你是看他去的嗎？」</p>
<p>「對啦。我怎麽可以不看作他呢？他今年已經二十歲了。」他說着，忘了疲倦似地漸漸興奮起來，一對眼珠子出神似地望着我。「他的老闆離然已經四十歲了，却有一個年輕的，具備着一切婦人智慧的妻子。她天天用躲在家里悶不過，並且也離不開她的男人的理由到菜塲去。她喜歡邦加，她—這樣我就感到有什麼不幸的事伴要到來一樣，要邦加扔掉那個助手的職務，回到家里來」。</p>
<p>說到這里他停住了。可是當我要打挿一句話的時候他又繼續着說：</p>
<p>「你猜邦加怎麽說？他說辭了那個職務不是要餓肚皮了麼，我們一共有五個人吃飯。是的，邦加不能沒有工作；我又老得只剩一身骨頭…」</p>
<p>聽了這麽許多說，我還沒有明白這老人天天看他的兒子去的原因。但是從那個年輕的老闆娘的身上可以推想得到：他是想法子防止着女人對於邦加的誘惑。</p>
<p>「女人是親近不得的啊！」他終於用哲學家的風度說出來了。「她有的時候是一條蛇，緊緊地纏住你，不讓你做你底了。有的時候她是吸血蟲，她吃乾了你象上的血液，然後就扔棄你了！」</p>
<p>大孩子的我沒有理　他的說教的智力，却看出他那縐紋滿刻着的蒼老的臉上是曾經在女人的手上得到極深的教訓的。他那沒有扣攏的狹穿的胸部一起一伏的跳躍。於是，他想到了什麽似地，一絲酸苦的微笑泛起在乾枯的唇邊，沉默下來了。</p>
<p>太陽的光綫軟弱得棉一般，瀉在對過靑色的烟田上；吹着的回晚的風掠過去時，烟苗被捲成波浪似地，十分耀眼。我默默地望着靑色的浪，老人的氣息和港水的聲音柔和而淸澈。可是黃昏已經臨近了。</p>
<p>臨別的時候他背伸着手去槌了一陣腰，然後站立在我的前面。「你不懂我的話的，你不懂…」</p>
<p>就落寞地走了…</p>
<p>那時候我正熱戀着一個嫵媚而活潑的少女，她因爲母親的病回到婆羅洲去了。想起椰子林下的戀情，第二天我就坐了船，從港水上面漂向家里，等待着一個年輕人的夢……</p>
<h3>東行草</h3>
<p>— 流冰</p>
<p>二·東京的食</p>
<p>談到食物，我想，全世界的國家沒有比日本人再節儉簡單的了。不過，他們雖然節儉簡單，而食物中所含的營養料郤比我國那些耗金錢而又麻煩的大酒席還要多。</p>
<p>日人普通吃三餐，早飯大槪是家家一律的，每人一小碗咪　湯，三幾片黃蘿蔔，如果還有一點較好的小菜，那是中等以上的人家了。同時，他們很講究客氣的，雖然是一家人，到放下飯碗時，兒女也得　母親說：「多謝你給我這樣豐滿的早餐，」而做母親的也要客氣地回答：「那裏，組糙得很」。呢中飯呢，大概男人和子女因為辦事或續書，多不在家中吃，他們的母親會和他們預備好一個「辦當箱。」（那是一種約六寸長四寸闊的方形扁鐵盒，裏面有兩三格，可以盛飯，幾片菜，和一對箸子。中午時，便用那裏面的一點菜飯解决肚子問題·晚餐是比較豐盛一點了，但普通的還是烤幾片魚，咪嘈湯，和幾片羅蔔。鷄肉是中等以上的人家才吃得起的。</p>
<p>他們不大吃豬肉，牛肉也是明治年間才開始有人吃，現在還不普遍，他們最愛吃的是魚。魚的種類也極繁羅，價格相差也很遠，有二錢一大塊的鮭魚，有專用飛機從琵琶湖運來的活鮎，不過　指大小，三四寸長價要四五十錢。這種魚是供給大戶人家不時用用的。</p>
<p>因爲日本人食東西的節單，所以留日中國學生戚到最不痛快的便是食。大家都還要食中國菜，可是，在東京想吃中國菜也是不容易，到支那料理館去吃，不好的還是和日本菜一樣。好的價錢驚人。想自己煮，一個人是萬難，因　日本人肯出租一個房間結中國人住，大都是因爲負窮，所以，他便趁此賺幾塊錢，你要租房子便得連吃飯，每月非二三十元不可。所以，有許多留日生合幾個人在京外住一個貨家」，自己一座房子，燒飯便方便了，如果再請一個下女，則什麽衣服洒掃都可解决了，幸而東京交通方便，又特別優待學生，雖住市外，也無甚關係。</p>
<p>自己弄飯吃的時候，最初也還會覺得無菜可吃，不過，住久了，便自然會發現許多價廉物美的好東西。比方，豬腰子就祗賣三個錢一隻，全副豬肝祗要兩十錢，因爲這些東西日本人　不吃的，祗有中國人去買來吃。但這東西也不容易買到，必先隔日和肉店先行定下，而且，吃這東西是爲日本瞧不起的，必需遮遮掩掩的吃。還有豬蹄，是我們中國人的妙品，但全東京都找不到的，要想豬蹄則非到橫濱去買不可，故留日學生如到橫濱時，必然要帶點豬蹄回來，價錢之　，簡直非國內所能相信。不過，近來日本人也聰明起來了，把價錢提高了許多。</p>
<p>吃鷄肉也要乖巧點，明明共一隻鷄，價錢就不　，背肉八角錢十兩，腿肉却祇要四角錢，此外還有一種牛奶鷄，尤其鮮美，價錢也不貴，據說這是牛奶塲的副產品，日常吃的是牛奶，所以他的味道也格外不同，但要大百貨公司才有賣，平常的市是買不到的。</p>

<p>快活林新片「小姨」歌曲</p>
<p>靑天如覆鈢，回望何寥廓，朗月當頭，只覺得空虛零落。亮晶晶的光波，冷消淸的塲合，萬里凄凉，可悶、拉孤單單的一個！哦，嘆紅顏命比烟還薄，淚比露還多，恨比天還闊，夢境在誘惑，棲烏在軟窩，羣星在笑樂，借問月兒呀！你，你，你，獨自團圓置，是不是也透着那們一點兒快活，快活。中心如火灼，　興何蕭索？亂世荒年，總不絕天災人禍，急忙忙的靑春，苦菌菌的生活，萬里銀河，肯讓我這孤兒來寄託…哦，直難忍耐着心兒過，盡此壽兒磨，任　繩兒縛，骨肉在宰割，身體在網盤，精神在炮烙，奮鬥到何時？我，我，我，才能　脫哩！問一問小嫦娥我可到底是誰的罪惡，罪惡？哦！</p>
<p>晚安</p>

<h3>British Reply to French Government: Mediterranean Fleet Difficult to Withdraw; Willing to Discuss Cooperation; League of Nations Sanctions Will Not Be Relaxed; Rumors of British Intention to Blockade the Italian Coast</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Laval proposed that the British government withdraw part of its Mediterranean fleet. The British government has replied, stating in essence that it is still necessary to maintain the British fleet in the Mediterranean. The British Cabinet held a meeting yesterday and politely rejected the French proposal. Last night, the British Ambassador to France delivered the reply to the French Prime Minister. It is reported that the British Ambassador stated to Laval that unless France provides equivalent protection, the British government cannot consider reducing its naval forces in the Mediterranean. Although the true content of last night's meeting has not yet been disclosed, it is generally expected that Laval, to facilitate negotiations with Mussolini, may use the French fleet as a backup for the British. It is said that the French Prime Minister inquired of the British Ambassador whether Britain could also reduce its military strength in the Mediterranean and return to its original state if Italy reduced its military strength stationed in Libya. However, informed sources here believe that the French Prime Minister's hope for successful mediation is extremely slim. Before the British Ambassador delivered the British government's reply last night, Laval received the Italian Ambassador to France. According to unconfirmed reports, the Italian Ambassador delivered Mussolini's constructive reply to the French Prime Minister. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A semi-official British spokesperson recently made a statement to a Havas News Agency reporter, stating, "Forced by circumstances, Britain may blockade the Italian coast, the Suez Canal, and the entrances to the Red Sea. If so, it would only be as a last resort to save the League of Nations from demise. Although the nature of a blockade is not a military sanction, it would inevitably raise some strategic military issues. If the Italian coast is to be blockaded, it must be done through the full cooperation of the British and French navies. Therefore, Britain is doing its utmost to avoid it. This morning, British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden proposed to the Economic Sanctions Committee that a complete ban on the import of Italian goods should be enforced, rather than adopting a genuine blockade. This is the real reason." (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet met today and thoroughly considered the entire situation regarding the Italian-Abyssinian issue, and it was learned that Foreign Secretary Hoare plans to deliver a speech in the House of Commons on October 22. His speech draft has also been approved by the Cabinet. It is generally expected that Hoare will declare in his speech that Britain will not resort to war unless faced with extreme provocation. (Sixteenth National dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned from official circles today that if a conflict were to occur between Britain and Italy, Britain had originally requested naval assistance from France. Now, it would be satisfied if British ships were allowed to use French ports. Britain believes that its future support for the League of Nations and its general policy on European issues will depend entirely on France's response. (Sixteenth National dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' sanctions actions continue today. However, diplomats here are paying close attention to the discord between Britain and France. Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech to the League of Nations in mid-September has been brought up again today to prove that if France is too supportive of Italy and fails to support Britain's collective security system, Britain is prepared to isolate itself from the European continent. It is believed here today that France's efforts to maintain goodwill with Italy may strengthen the relationship between Britain and Germany. If Britain were to relinquish its position as the active leader of the collective security system, the League of Nations would be reduced to a mere shell. (Sixteenth National dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to opinions from circles close to the League of Nations, French Prime Minister Laval's recent, or perhaps final, attempt to reconcile the Italo-Abyssinian War will likely fail. Therefore, the League of Nations' organization of sanctions against Italy shows no sign of relaxation. It is generally believed that even if Mussolini finds Laval's proposal acceptable, the Abyssinian Emperor will definitely reject it, as the Abyssinian Emperor is now being supported by the League of Nations. However, people here do not believe that Mussolini will accept Laval's proposal. (Seventeenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval successively received Italian Ambassador Cerruti and British Ambassador Clerk today, and the meetings lasted quite a long time. Although officials are adopting a reserved attitude regarding the content of the talks, it is generally believed that Laval is still making efforts for reconciliation. According to general impressions, negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy seem to be at a standstill. (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain's Firm Actions Cause Great Anxiety in Rome; Last Hope Lies in the Vatican's Mediation</h3>
<p>(Rome) Political figures are quite uneasy due to the British government's strong advocacy of strict sanctions, believing that the last hope for a peaceful resolution lies with the Vatican, as the Vatican's current policy is to oppose severe sanctions. Official circles here have expressed surprise at the firm policy adopted by Britain, believing that Italian policy has never threatened British interests in East Africa. The firm actions taken by Britain, ostensibly due to respect for the League of Nations, are also not seen as fully justified. It is recalled that British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, during his visit to Rome in May of this year, proposed suggestions for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, without advocating the participation of the League of Nations. According to those in charge, the Vatican has recently begun mediation through diplomatic channels. Its stance is to oppose all wars, including Italy's war against Abyssinia. It particularly opposes severe sanctions, especially military sanctions, for fear that they will ignite a second world war. Therefore, the Vatican's ambassadors to various countries have recently received instructions to carry out mediation work separately. (Seventeenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Reveals its Hand: Implementing a Boycott of Italian Goods; Sanctions Committee Unanimously Passes Resolution Yesterday; Mutual Aid Committee Considers Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Economic Sanctions Committee discussed the proposal put forward by British Minister Without Portfolio Eden this morning, advocating a ban on the import of Italian goods, which was unanimously passed. The British delegation believes this is a major success for Britain. Firstly, no representative of the participating countries expressed opposition to the ban on the import of Italian goods during today's discussion of the proposal. Secondly, the Little Entente and Balkan Entente countries did not propose corresponding loss compensation as a condition for participating in economic sanctions, which was beyond initial expectations. Thirdly, representatives of South American countries, such as Argentina and Venezuela, had previously raised important reservations, but still voted in favor of the proposal today, which was also beyond initial expectations. Furthermore, according to Havas News Agency reporters, the smaller countries are indeed enthusiastic in upholding the League of Nations Covenant. For example, Lithuanian representative and Minister to France, Klimas, declared to this reporter that Lithuania advocates increasing the authority of the League of Nations more than anyone else. A key figure in the Czechoslovakian delegation said, "We have a dual purpose. Firstly, we must respect the League of Nations Covenant, as the Covenant is the only guarantee of our country's independence and security. Secondly, we must take into account the mutual cooperation between Italy and the Little Entente countries to avoid irreparable damage. We will always fully support all measures agreed upon by the countries. However, we must avoid causing unnecessary difficulties for Italy, as Italy is an element of European stability." (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Economic Sanctions Committee decided to list prohibited items into two categories when it discussed the issue of raw materials being transported to Italy this morning. The first list includes items such as steel, wool, rubber, and machinery. The second list includes items such as coal, kerosene, cotton, and copper. This list must be discussed after the committee has determined the attitudes of non-member states. The committee then continued its meeting in the afternoon to discuss the proposal put forward by British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, which is to advocate a boycott of Italian exports. Representatives from Poland and Switzerland raised reservations. The reservation raised by Polish representative Komarnicki concerned how to handle existing contracts, such as Poland having ordered ships to be built in Italy. Although they have not yet been completed, installments have already been paid. Swiss representative Stucki opposed the proposal put forward by the British delegation, giving the following reasons: (1) Hungary and Austria have adopted an opposing attitude; (2) the compensation method has not yet been determined; (3) Switzerland's economy has special circumstances. The Economic Sanctions Committee decided to appoint a subcommittee to study various special issues, such as the ships ordered by Poland. (Seventeenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the League of Nations Mutual Aid Committee, the Romanian Foreign Minister stated that Romania is willing to support Britain's decision that sanctions against Italy must be implemented regardless of the circumstances, and regardless of the issue of mutual assistance and compensation. The Eighteen-Member Committee passed the Law Subcommittee's report on the question of whether sanctions could be implemented or delayed due to constitutional difficulties. The jurists believed that any member of the League of Nations is bound by Article 16 of the Covenant, and all member states have a responsibility to swiftly devise measures to implement sanctions. After the report was read out, the Argentine representative immediately withdrew his previous reservation. The Eighteen-Member Committee also passed the Military Subcommittee's report, which included various gas appliances used in scientific and incendiary tactics on the list of prohibited items. The above two reports were subsequently passed by the Sanctions Coordination Committee in an open meeting. British representative Eden's proposal that Italian products should be completely banned has now gained almost unanimous support from all countries. The Soviet Union, the Little Entente countries, the Balkan Entente countries, and the Scandinavian countries are particularly supportive of this proposal. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Resolution to Notify the U.S. and Germany</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Havas News Agency reporters learned from those in charge that the League of Nations does not intend to ask Germany and the United States to participate in the currently planned sanctions against Italy. However, all decisions made by the League of Nations regarding the sanctions issue will be notified to both member and non-member states alike. All discussions and resolutions of the League of Nations on this issue have been separately notified to the governments of Berlin and Washington. (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of boycotting Italian exports, the British and French governments have not approached the State Department to request the United States to participate. Well-informed sources believe that the United States' position will be guided by wartime neutrality and will not change. President Roosevelt's recent declaration that American citizens trading with belligerent countries must bear the risks themselves has been criticized by some as exceeding the scope of his authority, so it is unlikely that he will take further action. Reporters recently asked Secretary of Commerce Roper whether the effectiveness of the League of Nations' economic sanctions would be reduced if the United States refused to participate. Roper gave a vague answer, refusing to say whether the United States was prepared to add raw materials to the embargo list, only stating, "We are now willing to study all issues in order to take the necessary actions." (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Initiates Suspension of Kerosene Supply</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored that negotiations are currently underway in Geneva to completely halt the supply of kerosene to Italy. This claim has recently been verified by the kerosene industry. It is said that the proposal to stop supplying kerosene to Italy was initiated by the Soviet Union, and Britain is strongly supporting it. Agents of various oil companies are currently refusing to make any statements, but it is true that British and American oil companies are holding negotiations in Geneva regarding this matter. As for the kerosene produced in Romania, it is said that the Romanian government has not yet made a firm statement, only saying that if its kerosene exports to Italy are stopped, its losses should be compensated. Furthermore, the British side believes that Italy has acquired kerosene concessions in Romania, so whether implementing a kerosene embargo would be in vain is also a question. (Sixteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Observations on Soviet Union's Tactics in the League of Nations: Aimed at Gaining British Assistance to Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun carried a report today citing "reliable sources" stating that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov had asked British Cabinet Minister Eden whether Britain would be willing to implement sanctions in the future if Soviet territory were invaded by an enemy. The newspaper commented that this news is now attracting attention, as the Soviet Union's behavior is seen as a peculiar strategy aimed at attracting the League of Nations as its ardent supporter, thereby gaining a way to restrain Japan. The newspaper also stated that at a recent meeting of the League of Nations Sanctions Committee, Litvinov, like Britain, took a tough stance, urging the committee to impose sanctions on all countries that do not cooperate with the League of Nations in implementing sanctions against Italy, regardless of whether they are member states or not.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Issue of Awarding Honorary Doctorate Degrees</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>In the past, during the era when Xu Shichang served as President of the Beiyang Government, the University of Paris in France awarded Xu an honorary doctorate in literature. This marked the beginning of Chinese individuals receiving honorary degrees from foreigners. A few years ago, renowned playwright Mei Lanfang toured the United States and was also awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by Pomona College in the United States. St. John's University in Shanghai has also awarded honorary doctorates to prominent political figures and social celebrities in the country on several occasions. Most recently, when Fudan University held its 30th anniversary celebration, it awarded honorary doctorates to Sun Ke and five others. Tracing back the history of awarding honorary doctorates in China, it has been many years. Although it is difficult to judge the merits and demerits of this system, whether ordinary public and private universities have the authority to award doctorates or honorary doctorates in China today is undoubtedly a question worth discussing. According to the Ministry of Education's explicit ban in the 19th year of the Republic of China regarding universities awarding honorary degrees, the Ministry of Education also issued a circular to all universities on the 14th of this month, stating that before the degree law is promulgated, they must not award degrees without authorization. This is because the awarding of degrees must be extremely cautious, so that those who receive them can value their worth and not lose their effect of encouragement. If those who grant them do not do so properly, and their intentions are also different, then those who follow suit will inevitably rise up in groups. Even if one wants not to lose the dignity and preciousness of the degree, it is impossible.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the number of people in our country with doctoral titles has been increasing day by day. However, when asked about those who conferred them, they are all foreign universities. Among them, the United States is particularly numerous. However, whether the title of so-called doctorate truly matches its substance often becomes a major question. Moreover, the dissertations of Chinese people who obtain doctorates from foreign universities often draw material from topics related to Chinese issues. Foreigners do not fully understand Chinese issues. How can they rigorously grant doctoral degrees? Moreover, in fact, those who obtain doctoral degrees based on Chinese dissertations often bear only empty reputations. Not only are they unable to fulfill their responsibility of introducing Western culture, but they may not even have special research on China's cultural relics and systems. Moreover, according to a survey by the American Educational Research Association, the average number of graduate schools at American universities that award doctoral degrees is more than 30. However, strictly speaking, no more than seven of those who award degrees can truly live up to their name. From this point alone, the abuse of doctoral degree awards in the United States can be generally seen. We should have two kinds of awareness about this. (1) Foreign doctorates are not necessarily scholars with true learning. Therefore, the state has the necessity to re-examine or award degrees separately. (2) The phenomenon of domestic and foreign universities awarding doctorates without standards should be prevented as early as possible to avoid becoming too much. In short, the right to award doctoral degrees should be controlled by the state. The matter may be handled jointly by the Examination Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Academia Sinica. After a considerable period, it may be possible to establish the foundation for China's academic independence and recover the scholarship awarding power that has been outward for a long time.</p>
<p>As for honorary doctorates, it is also most appropriate for the state to award them. The qualifications of the recipients should have strict regulations, so that these degrees are completely used to reward academic culture related to production. As for personal political achievements, the government may give awards such as medals. This is because the revival of our country's national fortune in the future lies in material construction. Therefore, the encouragement of inventors should be done with the greatest effort. In my opinion, those who can make theoretical breakthroughs in pure science should be awarded honorary doctorates by the state. At the same time, those who can make special inventions in mechanics and technology should also be awarded honorary doctorates for encouragement. If so, is it not better than awarding them without standards?</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that this issue is very important. Domestic education experts should pay attention to it as soon as possible and contribute more opinions so that legislators can learn from it to facilitate progress. At the same time, the Examination Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Academia Sinica should also draft degree awarding methods as soon as possible and announce them for implementation, so that Chinese people can gradually recognize the dignity of degrees.</p>

<h3>100,000 Abyssinian Troops Prepare to Advance to the Front Lines: The East African War Is About to Begin; Italian Troops Advance in the North to Invade Magal; Advance Along the Shibili River in the South</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa. The Abyssinian General Headquarters is preparing to deploy the troops concentrated here to the front lines for combat. The outcome of the overall situation will soon be determined. The destination of the troops is currently kept secret. However, according to authoritative sources today, the main Abyssinian defense line will be located somewhere northeast of here and between Tesse and Dire Dawa. Minister of the Army Getachew and other cabinet members may personally lead private troops to participate in the war. Government officials and tribal chiefs will also join. Observers predict that the Abyssinian Emperor will soon go to the front lines to establish a headquarters. It is generally believed here that the rains preventing Italian troops from advancing southward from Somalia have prompted the Abyssinians to quickly decide to take the offensive. Thousands of barbarian tribal people stationed outside Addis Ababa have engaged in internal strife due to competing to go to the front lines to fight the Italian army, resulting in 30 injuries. (Sixteenth National dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. Italian troops have launched a new offensive on the northern front, invading Magal, located 65 miles southeast of Adowa. The city is the second major objective for the Italian offensive. According to news received in Addis Ababa today, Italian troops are currently engaged in surrounding it. It is reported that two Italian planes flew over the Afdan and Bikte stations on the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway today. The two stations are located between Addis Ababa and Harar. Italian troops are also continuing to advance along the Shibili River in the southern front. The climate there is extremely hot, and the people of various tribes are extremely hostile to the Italians, so the situation facing the Italian troops is very difficult. There are currently 100,000 troops stationed around Addis Ababa. The plains are filled with tens of thousands of camps. Women, children, servants, and maids are also accompanying the soldiers to the front lines in groups. Today, a woman riding a white mule, followed by 100 people, went to the palace to request the issuance of weapons to help fight on the front lines, which moved those who saw it. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. If the Italian military authorities continue to transfer southern white soldiers to other places, General Nasibu, the commander-in-chief of the southern Abyssinian army, may launch an offensive against the Italian army. According to various sources, troops in the interior are being mobilized very busily, indicating that the war is about to begin. (Seventeenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. According to news from Ginir in the southern Bali province, it is confirmed that the Abyssinian army is planning to advance to the southeast to make close contact with the valleys near the Shibili River. Due to miasma and lack of water, it seems impossible to attack by going south from Harar. However, by passing through relatively low-lying areas near the Shibili River, the Italian army's left flank can be attacked quickly. This offensive will be led by various tribal leaders from Bali province led by General Taitai. The general's villa outside Addis Ababa is still being used as residence for Italian envoy Count Vinci. The Abyssinian army does not have to carry food like the Italian army and can obtain food locally, which is a great advantage. (Seventeenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Authorities here fear that after the lifting of the arms embargo against Abyssinia, the Abyssinian army's war equipment will inevitably be replenished.

<h3>Large Numbers of Troops Gather in Addis Ababa: Men and Women Share the Same Hatred of the Enemy</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa. An unprecedented grand review was held today in the square outside the Addis Ababa Parliament. 50,000 cavalry, infantry, and auxiliary soldiers marched past the Abyssinian Emperor. The Emperor then delivered a speech of encouragement. When the 3,000-4,000 guards, who are about to depart for the Taishih and Magal areas in the north, were conducting artillery exercises, the Abyssinian Emperor personally aimed and fired a 37mm Mida gun twice, hitting a small tree in the distance, and the soldiers at the scene cheered in praise of the Abyssinian Emperor's eyesight. (Seventeenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. Our special correspondent Ochina cabled that 100,000 Abyssinian soldiers are commanded by General Mullu and are about to depart for the front lines for combat. The Abyssinian Emperor recently inspected them and gave a speech saying, "The reason why we have been slow to retaliate against Italy's acts of aggression is because we are constrained by the League of Nations Covenant. Now that the League of Nations has designated Italy as an aggressor, our actions have therefore gained freedom. Soldiers, be brave and go forward to kill the enemy!" (Seventeenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. According to our war correspondent Lavoya, a large number of troops are currently concentrated in the vicinity of the capital, including 50,000 troops from the Kaffa region, 30,000 troops from the Ikakni Ariel region, and 50,000 troops from the Walega province. (All three regions are located in the southwest of Abyssinia, bordering the British-Egyptian Sudan.) The government is preventing various armies from stationing in the city for fear of disturbing public order, because various armies come from remote border areas, and their appearance is not much different from that of Europeans, so they can be easily mistaken for Italian soldiers. In total, about 100,000 troops are concentrated near the capital. They will participate in the unprecedented large-scale military exercise of Abyssinia, personally inspected by the Emperor and ministers. Afterwards, they will personally lead the army to depart for the front lines to supervise the battle. In recent days, a large number of volunteers have gathered around the Imperial Palace, expressing their loyalty to the Emperor to the palace gates from afar. Even women are participating, mixing into the military ranks. Among them, a woman riding a white mule, followed by a personal male bodyguard of 100 people, entered the palace to petition to be granted military weapons and ammunition to go to the front lines to kill the enemy, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. Today is also the feast day of St. Apostle, protected by more than a thousand guards, the Emperor personally went to St. Apostle's Church to pray for the Holy Spirit to exert its divine power to protect the Abyssinian army. In addition, the road from the capital to Taishi City is now being rushed by thousands of workers, so that when the Emperor leads the ministers to the front lines, the large team can travel easily.

<h3>Italian Military High Command to Confer on Offensive Strategy; Aja General Appointed Governor of Tigray Province</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to a report from Adowa, General De Bono, the supreme commander of the Italian forces in East Africa, deeply impressed upon the chiefs and priests of the Agame province the sincerity of their submission today in Adigrat. The General entered the church of Quorattic, knelt and prayed, and then kissed the ivory cross on the altar. He then announced to the chiefs and priests that Italy was determined to occupy Tigray and make it a prosperous and loyal province of Italy. He then appointed, in the name of the King of Italy, the recently surrendered Gokchai as the Governor of Tigray Province. The Italian army has begun to repair Adowa and has decided to demolish the residence of the famous Ethiopian leader General Seyoum, to create a square in the city. Today, General De Bono conferred with General Badoglio, the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, who arrived in Adowa from Rome a few days ago, on the offensive strategy. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Cairo: The troops stationed in Italian Libya and Cyrenaica in Africa are now increasing defense works in the area near Gegsab, in front of the Siwah oasis, digging trenches, laying mines, and concentrating large numbers of tanks and ammunition towards the Egyptian border. However, this claim is currently difficult to verify. This move is probably related to the recent defensive measures taken by the British and Egyptian governments on the Libyan border. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Cairo: The Egyptian railway authorities have now taken all necessary steps to prevent the outbreak of war. The railway bureau has purchased and stored 4,000 tons of coal and 200,000 railway sleepers for emergency needs.

Although reinforcements are continuously heading to Harar, political circles deny that the Ethiopian king has ordered a general offensive in the Ogaden. The Ethiopian king's strategy is to allow the Italian army to advance, extend its communication lines, and then launch a surprise attack. The Ogaden province is often plagued by fever in November, which will greatly help the Ethiopian army. It is said that the reason why the Italian army transferred 10,000 white soldiers from the Ogaden province to Eritrea was for this reason. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>Revision of Stamp Tax Rates: Three Points of Recommendations from Various Parties</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the implementation of the Stamp Tax Law, various parties have pointed out that many provisions in the tax rate schedule require careful consideration. They have requested the government to revise it. It is now known that the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan has scheduled a review meeting on the 18th. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, as well as the banking, insurance, and shipping industries, have been invited to the Yuan to present their opinions for reference. It is reported that opinions from various parties on the revision of the Stamp Tax Law rate schedule have converged on the following three points: 1. Regarding stamp duty on checks, the current law stipulates complicated procedures. When revising, the principle of stamping should still follow the old stamping procedure. It is proposed to adopt the British legislative example, where checks issued by banks are only stamped with a "stamp duty paid" mark. The banks would report the number of checks they issued to the government for verification, and the government would levy taxes based on their reports. Any concealment or underpayment would be penalized according to the law. However, in England, the stamp of "stamp duty paid" is affixed by government offices, while in our country, it would be affixed by banks. 2. Regarding stamp duty on insurance policies, the current law does not differentiate between life and property insurance, which is considered unfair. When revising, life insurance policies should follow the current system, while property insurance policies should be subject to separate regulations based on the length of the insurance period. 3. Regarding stamp duty on shipping bills of lading, the current law does not differentiate between long and short voyages. For example, a bill of lading for a ship sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo has the same stamp duty of 20 cents as one for a ship sailing from Shanghai to America. This seems unfair. When revising, it is proposed to differentiate based on the length of the voyage. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Collapse of the Dike at the Juye Section of the Yellow River: Raging Yellow Waters Flood Two Entire Villages; Zhang Lianjia Has Arrived to Supervise Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Last night, a strong northwest wind caused the main current of the Yellow River to surge directly against the dike at Juye. Despite desperate rescue efforts, it collapsed at 8:30 this morning. The breach is ten zhang wide and three chi deep. Two villages were flooded. Although there is a small levee behind the collapsed dike, it is newly built, has not been subjected to rain, and is composed of shifting sand. Once the current reaches it, it will be difficult to withstand. If it collapses again, not only will tens of thousands of acres of fertile land within the river bend be flooded, but also the major dike on the south bank, which has not yet been reached by the water, is at risk. If there is any negligence, then Juye, Wenshang, Dongping, Feicheng, Tai'an, and Ningyang will all be affected. Practically no dry land would remain in southwestern and western Shandong. Zhang Lianjia has arrived to supervise the rescue efforts. However, the breach at Dongzhuang may reduce the water flow, making it easier to close the breach. Reportedly, this dike was the one that Li Yizhi advocated breaching last month. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

However, the collapsed portion has reached three kilometers, and the situation is critical. They are currently rushing to build a diversion dam. In addition, another six meters of the bank at the junction of the southern third and fourth sections has collapsed, leaving only sixty-four meters to the dike.

<h3>Economic Delegation's Visit in Tokyo: Exchanges, Banks, Textile Factories, and Paper Mills</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: The Chinese Economic Delegation was hosted for lunch by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the 11th. Key members of the Chamber attended. After a welcoming speech by the host, Wu Dingchang also gave a brief reply. In addition to expressing gratitude, he hoped that in the future, trade between the two countries, any things that benefited both sides, could be discussed openly, such as yarn factories and coal industries, in order to find ways to help each other and benefit each other. At 6:00 PM, they were invited by the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Trade Association to have dinner at the Yokohama Shokin Club. The location was on a mountaintop overlooking the entire city of Yokohama. The hosts, Tadaichi Ariyoshi and Nobuhiro Kamiya (Ariyoshi is the brother of the ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi), prepared eight tables of famous Chinese cuisine and invited the family members of the delegation to the banquet, which was hosted by the women. The banquet was quite grand. After the meal, they viewed the night scene of Yokohama together on the roof until about 9:00 PM, when the guests and hosts happily bid farewell. On the morning of the 12th, they began their visits, dividing into two groups. One group visited the exchange, and the other visited the Bank of Japan. When the delegation arrived at the exchange, the brokers temporarily stopped working and applauded to welcome them. At noon, eleven banks in Tokyo held a banquet at the Bankers Club. During the meal, they casually chatted and did not give speeches. After the banquet, it was heard that they briefly discussed the recent situation of the banking industry in China and Japan in the conference room. They dispersed at about 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, they divided into two groups again, one group visiting the Nisshin Textile Factory and the other visiting the Oji Paper Factory, and they also paid their respects at the memorial hall of Viscount Shibusawa, a pioneer of the Japanese industrial world. In the evening, they attended a dinner party hosted by the Japan-China Friendship Association at the Jin'yokukan.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Provisional Headquarters to be Established in Sichuan Next Month; Yichang Headquarters Responsible for Directing Bandit Suppression in Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Previously, when the bandit suppression in northern Sichuan was intense, the two bandits He Long and Su Ke used their main force to disturb the borders of Hunan and Hubei, eyeing Jin and Feng with the potential to make a comeback. The large armies of Hunan and Hubei provinces, led by Liu Jianxu and Xu Yuanquan, fought fiercely with the bandits but failed to completely eliminate them. Chairman Chiang once considered personally supervising the suppression but was unable to spare the time. He then ordered He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, to reside in Yichang and represent him in directing the suppression. After receiving the order, He departed from Hankou to Yichang to organize a headquarters and direct the various armies to advance and suppress the bandits. The bandit offensive was thus slightly curbed. The headquarters soon moved to Shashi. The two bandits, He and Xiao, retreated eastward after suffering losses and continued to develop westward. They are now in the Sangzhi and Shimen areas, bordering the National Army. On October 10th, Chairman Chiang's Yichang headquarters was established, responsible for directing the military affairs of bandit suppression. He then abolished the headquarters and returned to Hankou by plane on the 16th to oversee matters. The important officials of the headquarters, Xu Chengxi, Wei Wuxiang, Hua Juemin, and others, all returned east on the German "De Xin" ship to the Sichuan headquarters. The Sichuan headquarters is scheduled to be established on the first of next month. The Wuhan headquarters will cease operations on the 20th of this month. Zhang Xueliang has already returned to Hankou by plane from Xi'an today to oversee the closing affairs. After the headquarters is closed, all requests for instructions and telegrams should be sent to Chongqing. Chairman Chiang has telegraphed all parties to inform them of this. (October 16th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Provincial Government for Relief in the Market; Provincial Government Consults with Banks to Release Loans</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi's commerce has plummeted in recent years. Since the summer, bankruptcies have occurred one after another, causing widespread anxiety. The Nanchang Chamber of Commerce held a special meeting yesterday and decided to petition the provincial government's Finance Department for relief. On the 15th, the executive members of the city's Chamber of Commerce, Xu Huaiqing and Wan Zhucun, and others, carried a petition to the provincial government. Xiong Shihui came out to meet them. Xiong told Xu and others that the provincial government had long considered this matter. Director Wu of the Finance Department reported in detail at the provincial affairs meeting. Regarding temporary measures, the Finance Department will order all banks to lend as much as possible to industry and commerce. Fundamental solutions are still being planned. Xu and others then petitioned the Finance Department. Director Wu replied, saying that he had been deeply concerned about this matter and had convened a meeting with the banking community to discuss relief measures. It was decided that each bank would lend as much as possible for relief. It is now proposed that the Yumin Bank allocate 1 million yuan from the tungsten mine to relieve the market. Other banks will also release as much as possible. After the New Year, each bank must also provide as much credit as possible in order to adjust the market. The text of the petition is recorded below: "Upon investigation, at the 119th executive committee meeting of the Chamber, the first temporary motion, proposed by Committee Member Yue Jingqing, Committee Member Xu Huaiqing, Committee Member Liang Dui Shi, Committee Member Yang Gengfu, Committee Member Yan Sui Zhi, Committee Member Zhang Zipan, and Committee Member Zhao Zhi Zhou, stated that bankruptcies are now frequently seen in this city. An atmosphere of depression is undeniable. Commerce is already in recession, and finance is becoming increasingly tight. If a collapse occurs again, the market will be in an even more unimaginable state. If no relief measures are taken, people will become even more panicked. The method of relief is to invigorate finance and turnover in the market. It was unanimously resolved to petition the government and the Finance Department to consider the commercial situation and approve the immediate convening of the city's banks to properly plan relief measures to stabilize commerce and reassure the people. We hereby submit this petition to your government for review and approval. We earnestly request that you convene the banks as soon as possible to properly plan relief measures. The situation is urgent, and we hope for immediate implementation." (October 15th)</p>
<h3>European Situation is Tense; Guangdong's Exports Find New Opportunities; Demand for Tungsten Ore Exceeds Supply; Silk Exports Also Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the global recession began, the major exports of Guangdong Province have declined sharply. The raw materials that Guangdong has traditionally exported in large quantities include silk, grass mats, cinnamon, canned food, tea, tobacco, and the minerals tungsten and manganese. Recently, the war between Italy and Abyssinia broke out, and the clouds of war filled Europe. Sea transportation gradually became inconvenient, and the global market underwent new changes due to various factors. Guangzhou, the commercial center of South China, is close to Hong Kong, and its commercial relationship is closely connected to foreign countries. It is inevitable that the Guangzhou market will change as the global market changes. Therefore, since the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia began, all countries have been searching for military supplies. The demand for raw materials for military equipment, such as tungsten ore, is particularly urgent. Therefore, the demand for Guangdong's tungsten ore has suddenly exceeded the supply. Previously, the value of each dan (100 catties) was only six yuan. Before long it rose to eight or nine yuan. Recently, due to foreign competition, the value of each dan has risen to seventeen to twenty yuan. The four countries that order this tungsten ore are mainly Britain, Italy, France, and Japan. On average, Guangdong exports several hundred dan per day. Tungsten ore merchants here have personally gone to various mining areas to search for supplies to meet the demand. As for raw silk, it is not related to the war. However, because Italy, the country that produces the world's artificial silk, has recently been subjected to an invisible blockade, Italy's artificial silk exports have almost stopped. Silk merchants from various countries have turned to Guangdong Province to order local silk to replace Italy's artificial silk. As a result, the price of Guangdong silk has risen sharply. In a period of ten days, local silk has risen to more than three jiao and five fen per liang, which is almost one-third higher than the previous month. According to those in the industry, the production of silk in this province is limited. Because of the continuous exports, prices will continue to rise. In addition, the sales of raw silk exported to foreign countries have also recently shown improvement. The export of raw silk has been depressed for a long time. The economies of the silk-producing villages in Shunde, Nanhai, Zhongshan, and other counties have long been bankrupt. The rise in the price of silk is a boon for the silk farmers in the above three counties. According to a recent survey, 1,292 packages of raw silk were exported from this province in the second half of last month, accounting for a large portion of the total of more than 12,000 packages exported in the five months from May to September of this year. It is estimated that October can double the previous month, and the future seems promising. (October 12th)</p>

<p>Jiading: Ancient Stone Carvings Discovered in Anting</p>
<p>Boddhi Temple in Anting Town, which is under the jurisdiction of the county, is an ancient temple built during the Chiwu years of the Later Han Dynasty. Recently, the abbot of the temple, Monk Miaoxing, and others repaired the halls and rebuilt the Buddha seat. Yao Minghui, a layman from Nanxiang, was invited to illuminate the site and discovered an ancient stone carving in the center of the Buddha seat. The inscription reads: "Songjiang Prefecture, Shanghai County, 47th Bao, Grain Chief Gao Pei, Pond Chief Yao Ti, Chengziwei Wei Chief Zhu Qing, Weigengwei Chief 426 zhang and 6 chi, officially managed public and private fields totaling 2 qing, 1 mu, and 3 fen, assessed at 320 shi and 3 dou, built on the day of the seventh month of the seventh year of Zhengde." According to research, the seventh year of Zhengde, Xinwei, was 424 years ago. The 47th Bao is now the Ducun area of Qingpu County. Qingpu County was separated from Shanghai in the twenty-first year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty. During the Zhengde period, the 47th Bao was indeed within the territory of Shanghai County. After this stone was discovered, the resident monks properly placed it next to the Liang Dynasty well in the temple so that it may last for a long time.</p>
<p>Taicang: Seriously Accused Prisoners Escape from Jail</p>

This summer, more than half of the prisoners became ill, and nearly a hundred died, breaking a new record that had never been seen before. Local people blamed him with complaints. At around 2:00 PM on the 15th, seriously accused prisoners from Suzhou, including Wang Yuting, Du Junda, Wang Zhenhe, and Li Guangming, who were sentenced to more than ten years for robbery, broke through the walls and escaped. After discovering the escape, a search was conducted everywhere, but nothing was found. A report has now been made to the county, requesting neighboring counties to assist in the search.</p>

<p>Ningbo: Landslide at Shenjiamen</p>
<p>In front of the Xin Changmao Mixed Wood Company on the Donghengtang mud dike in Shenjiamen, Dinghai, there was an open space of about two or three mu. Outside the open space was the sea. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 PM on the 15th, the middle of the open space suddenly cracked open, and the tide gushed out from below. The ground immediately tilted towards the sea. In an instant, seawater poured in, transforming it into a part of the sea. Fortunately, the pedestrians at that time were able to run away quickly and no one fell into the water, causing a sensation throughout the town. Those who came to see from near and far were all speechless at the sight of the ocean. As for the cause of the collapse, those with a little geographical knowledge speculated that the embankment was eroded by the sea tide, the base of the embankment was hollowed out, and over time, it could not withstand the ground pressure, thus collapsing. Fortunately, there were no buildings on the ground, so the loss was minimal.</p>

<h3>Zhang Xiaoruo Suddenly Shot and Killed</h3>
<p>The murderer was Wu Yigao, an old servant of more than twenty years. After killing his master, he also committed suicide with the murder weapon. Zhang's concubine, Madam Li, was shot near her breast and is in critical condition.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaoruo, who held the reins of China's industry and commerce, a prominent figure in the industrial world, and the eldest son of Mr. Zhang Jian (Zijizhi), the former envoy to Europe and the United States for industrial investigation and a late Qing dynasty Zhuangyuan from Nantong, was suddenly shot and killed at 6:10 yesterday morning by Wu Yigao, an old servant from Anhui who had just arrived in Shanghai from Tongzhou the day before. The incident occurred at Zhang's residence at No. 1288 Lafayette Road in the French Concession. In addition to killing Zhang himself on the spot, the murderer continued to fire a shot at Zhang's concubine, Madam Li, with the bullet entering near her right breast, leaving her life hanging by a thread. Finally, realizing that it would be difficult to escape, the murderer aimed at his own chest and fired, killing himself at the bottom of the stairs. Zhang's residence immediately reported the incident to the French Concession police station by telephone. The police chief immediately dispatched several Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They first rushed Madam Li and the murderer Wu Yigao to the Guangci Hospital on Jinshenfu Road for emergency treatment. However, Wu died shortly after arriving at the hospital due to the severity of his injuries. Subsequently, the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor was instructed to send undertakers to transport the bodies of Zhang and Wu to the morgue. In the afternoon, personnel from the Second Special District Court arrived to conduct an examination. Zhang's remains were claimed by his eldest son, Feiwu, and sent to the Haig Road Chinese Funeral Home, with the funeral scheduled for 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 19th). The murderer's body will have its head dissected by a forensic doctor, and the brain will be extracted for detailed examination to determine whether the murderer suffered from mental derangement or premeditated the killing. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Mr. Zhang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, styled Xiaoruo, named Yi Zu, also known as Qianlu, was 38 years old and came from a prominent family in Nantong. He was the eldest son of Mr. Zhang Jian (Zijizhi), the late Qing dynasty Zhuangyuan. Mr. Zhang was young and handsome, with knowledge spanning both Chinese and Western learning. He was raised under strict family instruction, inheriting his father's legacy. At the age of 20, he went to the United States to study, earning a degree in engineering. After returning to China, he assisted his father in managing industrial enterprises, first establishing the Huaihai Industrial Bank and serving as its general manager. In the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), he was specially appointed as an envoy to Europe and the United States to investigate industrial affairs. In the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), he served as the Minister to Chile, and in the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), he served as the Chairman of the Yangtse River Waterway Commission, making numerous proposals.</p>
<p>Recent Events</p>
<p>After Mr. Jijizhi passed away, Mr. Zhang lost his ambition for officialdom. He devoted himself to editing his father's writings, the "Nine Records of Zhang Jizi," and inherited his father's business, dedicating all his efforts to industry, charity, and education. He was successively elected as the president of Nantong College, chairman of Dasheng Yarn Factory, general manager of Dada Steamboat Company, and executive director and chairman of various Huainan salt and land reclamation companies, as well as a director of the Continental Newspaper. In recent years, the industrial and salt land reclamation businesses have been facing precarious situations. He worked hard to support them, striving day and night. Thanks to him, his father's legacy did not collapse. He made it a routine to personally visit the above-mentioned organizations every day to discuss important matters, returning to his residence in the evening. He was known for his easygoing manner and broad-mindedness, and had no known enemies.</p>
<p>Old Servant Commits Murder</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's Shanghai residence was located at No. 1288 Lafayette Road in the French Concession. Living with him were his second beloved concubine, Madam Li (34 years old, from Wuxi), and two sons and four daughters. The older children were all studying at school. Wu Yigao, an old man from Anhui in his fifties, had served as a personal guard for Mr. Jijizhi during his lifetime for more than twenty years. After Mr. Jijizhi passed away, Mr. Zhang treated Wu with special consideration, as Wu was his father's guard. He ordered Wu to stay in Tongzhou to look after the old residence, paying him a monthly salary of thirty taels of silver. Recently, he had also recommended Wu's son to work in the steamboat company. Wu often traveled between Tongzhou and Shanghai, and when he came to Shanghai, he stayed at Zhang's residence.</p>
<p>Murder of the Master</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 16th), at around 2:00 PM, Wu arrived in Shanghai from Tongzhou on the Dada steamboat, carrying a wooden suitcase. After disembarking, he went straight to Zhang's residence to see Zhang. As usual, he stayed at Zhang's house that night. Zhang and his concubine, Madam Li, had their bedroom on the second floor in the front room. That night, Wu shared a bedroom in the back room with Zhang's servant, Zhou Zhimei (31 years old, from Changzhou). Unexpectedly, Wu had already harbored the intention to kill Zhang on this trip. Therefore, he brought with him a Mauser pistol (which Mr. Jijizhi had issued to Wu when he was his guard), hidden in the suitcase. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, while Zhang's family and servants were still asleep, he got out of bed, took the Mauser pistol, and quietly entered Zhang's bedroom. At that time, Zhang and his concubine, Madam Li, were sleeping in bed, barely awake. Wu immediately fired a shot at Zhang's left rib, the bullet piercing his right rib. Blood flowed all over the bed, and Zhang died instantly.</p>

<p>Murderer Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Madam Zhang suddenly heard the gunshot in her sleep. She woke up in shock and got out of bed, shouting for help. As she reached the doorway, Wu also aimed at her chest near her right breast and fired a shot. Madam Li was hit by the bullet and fell to the ground. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Wu, with the gun in his hand, went downstairs to escape. However, he then thought that both the front and back doors were locked, making it difficult to escape. When he reached the foot of the stairs, he held the Mauser pistol against his chest and committed suicide. When Zhang's family and servants heard the noise and woke up, they got up to check and saw Wu lying in a pool of blood at the foot of the stairs, moaning non-stop. They went upstairs and saw Zhang and Madam Li lying at the doorway, with fresh blood gushing out. They were unconscious. Zhang was already dead in bed, with blood staining the bedding.</p>
<p>Eldest Daughter Mourns</p>
<p>The family immediately reported the incident to the French Concession police station by telephone. Ambulances were immediately summoned to transport Zhang, Madam Li, and the murderer Wu Yigao to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment. At the same time, Zhang's body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor to be examined, awaiting a court inspection. Wu also died at the hospital due to the severity of his injuries to his chest. The police station sent the body to the morgue as well. Zhang's relatives and friends in Shanghai rushed to the morgue upon receiving the news to examine Zhang's body. Zhang's eldest daughter, Feiwu, 20 years old, who is currently studying at Wuben Girls' Middle School and boarding at the school, also rushed to the morgue after being informed by her family. She cried bitterly upon seeing her father's body, and was comforted by relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Court Examination</p>
<p>At noon, the French Concession police station reported the case to the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office. Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan, accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Jiang, clerk Peng Yishu, and others, arrived at the morgue to examine the bodies of Zhang and Wu. They then took their seats in court. According to the report by Western Detective and Chinese Detective Zhang Sheng, after the incident, the investigation revealed that, according to the testimony of Zhang's servant Zhou Zhimei, the murderer Wu Yigao was the old master's guard, accompanying him for more than twenty years. He is currently assigned to look after the old master's old residence in Nantong. The Mauser pistol was issued to him when he was a guard. This time, he came to Shanghai yesterday, arriving at Zhang's house at 2:00 PM. He slept with me in the back room at night. Unexpectedly, this morning, he killed the master. When I heard the noise and got up to check, the murderer was lying under the stairs moaning. I went upstairs into the room and saw Madam Li lying at the doorway, and the master was already dead in bed. I immediately reported it to the police station.</p>
<p>Servant's Testimony</p>
<p>As for the reason why Wu killed the master, it was probably because he asked the master to help his son get a better position, but the position he got was not good, and he harbored resentment because of this. Besides this, the master treated Wu very well, etc. Also, according to the case filed by the daughter of the deceased, Zhang Feiwu, she requested to claim her father's body. Other than that, she claimed that she lived in the school and did not know the details. After verifying the statements, Qiao declared that Zhang Xiaoruo had indeed died from gunshot wounds sustained during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his daughter, Zhang Feiwu, to prepare for the funeral. It was also declared that Wu Yigao had indeed committed suicide during his lifetime. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for collection. After the examination was completed, Zhang's body was transported to the Chinese Funeral Home, with the funeral scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 19th. Wu's body was collected by Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor with coffin number 3493. This morning, it was transported to the Pudong Cemetery for burial, awaiting family members to claim it.

<p>Gao Tingzi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday After Inspecting the Nanhua Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Gao Tingzi, Director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, flew to Guangzhou to inspect the shipping affairs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, first from Shanghai to Fuzhou, then to Wenzhou, and then took the route through Haimen and Ningbo to return to Shanghai. Director Gao inspected Fujian and Guangdong for three days, and after arriving in Haimen, he took the road through Huangyan, and then from Yin-Feng Road to Yongbu. Zhou Jianyin, the director of the Ningbo Shipping Administration Bureau, welcomed Gao and accompanied him on the inspection. In the evening, the Yongbu shipping merchants held a banquet at the YMCA. During the banquet, Gao gave many instructions on the shipping industry of Yongbu. On the 16th, he transferred to Zhenhai and took the Xin Jiangtian ship, returning to Shanghai yesterday morning. Director Gao considers the shipping achievements of Shantou and Guangzhou to be the best among the four provinces he investigated, because the people of Shantou and Guangzhou love national ships, and their enthusiasm is unmatched by other ports. The national goods in Shantou and Guangdong are almost entirely transported by domestic ships. The shipping industry in Fuzhou and Xiamen is far less successful than Shantou and Guangzhou. Due to time constraints, he did not have time to visit Guangxi for inspection. The Ministry of Transportation is now determined to improve the national shipping industry and strive for a basic organization. Because Director Gao is burdened with many affairs within the ministry, he could not stay outside for long, so he urgently needed to return to Beijing. As for North China, a special commissioner has been dispatched to conduct an inspection. After the inspection is completed, a report will be submitted to the ministry, and then a comprehensive improvement plan will be formulated.</p>

<h3>Minister Chen Petitions on Behalf of Zhejiang Fishermen</h3>
<p>Requests the Chairman of Zhejiang to Assist in Establishing Cooperatives and Writes to the Bank of China to Continue Handling Fishermen's Loans</p>
<p>According to the Shiye Press, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, at the request of the fishermen of Dinghai, Zhejiang Province, to organize fishery cooperatives and handle fishermen's loans, is strongly supporting them for the sake of rescuing the fishermen. In addition to writing to Huang Shaohong, the Chairman of Zhejiang Province, requesting assistance in establishing the cooperatives, he also wrote to Jing Songsun of the Bank of China in this city, requesting him to continue handling fishermen's loans to provide relief. The Shiye Press reporter recorded the original letter as follows: Mr. Songsun Jian, it is heard that your bank's Shenjiamen branch used to provide loans of 50,000 yuan to fishermen during the fishing season. This year, due to market conditions, the loans have been suspended. However, the fishing industry is declining, especially this year. If relief is not provided, it will inevitably be on the verge of bankruptcy. It is my duty and I cannot stand idly by. Therefore, I am specially requesting on their behalf. If you could consider handling it according to the old practice, both the public and private sectors would be grateful. Best wishes, Chen Gongbo.</p>
<p>The First Half of This Year Showed a Trend of Decreased Imports of Other Goods Due to the Contract for Purchasing Railway Materials</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi Press, according to German sources, German trade with China in the first half of this year was in a deficit. From January to June this year, German exports to China reached 47.7 million marks, an increase of 9.9 million marks compared to the first half of 1934. However, this is still 10 million marks less than the total value of Chinese goods imported into Germany. In the first half of this year, Chinese exports to Germany totaled 57 million marks, while in the first half of 1934 they totaled 64.4 million marks. According to economic observers, the reason for the increase in German exports to China is due to the large-scale purchase of railway materials after the conclusion of the contract for purchasing railway materials for Chinese railways. However, the export of other German goods to China has shown a decreasing trend. For example, German rayon exports to China in the first half of 1934 were about 900,000 kg, while in the first half of this year they were only 900,000 marks. Also, the number of Chinese eggs imported into Germany increased in the first half of this year, while German textiles, car and bicycle paints, and perfumes imported into China saw a large decrease. However, Chinese-made coarse yarn exports to Germany increased threefold, and Chinese sheepskins also increased. Chinese wool imports into Germany increased twofold, while cotton increased fourfold.</p>

<h3>Mortgage Rights of the Arsenal's Base. The City Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Land Bureau Declaring That If a Third Party Claims to Transfer the Land Certificate, It Would Be Detrimental to Legitimate Creditors and Should Be Rejected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Land Bureau yesterday stating, "We are writing to inform you that the entire real estate of the Shanghai Arsenal was mortgaged in 1924 when the military affairs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang ended. The then-Ministry and Provincial authorities entrusted the four groups of the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai County Chamber of Commerce, Charity Association, and Public Property Office to borrow commercial loans to pay for the demobilization of disbanded soldiers and for supplies and transportation. The former Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Army in Beijing jointly issued an official document, agreeing to use the Arsenal's base as collateral, and the former General Chamber of Commerce had a formal receipt. It was stipulated that once the relocation of the factory was implemented, all land prices would be used to repay the advances. The land title deed was originally stipulated to be held by the former General Chamber of Commerce. At the same time, Han Guojun, the Governor of Jiangsu Province, and the three groups of the County Chamber of Commerce also signed a contract with the same meaning as above. Later, the proposal to sell the land after the factory relocation was not implemented. In addition, with the transfer of political power, the former General Chamber of Commerce repeatedly presented the previous case in order to determine the mortgage debt, and on May 10, 1929, it received Official Letter No. 5032 from the Ministry of Finance, which stated, 'The Shanghai Arsenal's deeds are very important. In order to maintain the original case, the Ministry intends to have your association temporarily keep them, but you should be fully responsible and not re-mortgage or sell them. Once the Committee for the Management of Domestic and Foreign Debts has a definite plan for managing the aforementioned advances, they will be transferred to the competent authority in full.' The Executive Yuan was also informed and instructed to handle it as agreed. In accordance with the above-mentioned Ministry's letter and Executive Yuan's order, the above-mentioned deeds for the entire real estate of the Arsenal are still being kept by our association. Unless there is a definite plan for the advances and the land titles are transferred, the other party or any third party shall not engage in any behavior that would harm the rights and interests of the person holding the land title as a mortgage creditor. It is now heard that someone has applied to your bureau to transfer the land certificate of the base, knowing that the land title is held by the mortgage creditor, intending to obtain the land business license and then freely dispose of the real estate and abolish the mortgage deed. This kind of illegal behavior that damages the creditor's rights cannot be silenced, and the land title is still held by our association. It is difficult to understand on what basis the land business license was obtained. Therefore, we are writing to request your bureau to investigate the above situation. If someone applies, please reject it. This is our earnest request, and we hope to receive a reply."</p>

<h3>Concession Telephone Company States Call Charges Cannot be Abolished</h3>
<p>Different Automatic Systems in the Two Areas, Call Charges Collected According to Contract</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Telephone Company stated its opinion in response to a recent letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting the cancellation of call charges between the Chinese and Concession areas. The company stated that the method of collecting these call charges is based on the temporary contract signed on April 19, 1933. In a large area like Shanghai, it is not unreasonable to charge a small extra fee for user calls. Major cities such as New York and London have precedents for this, and Shanghai is not the first. The Concession Telephone Company has done its best to serve its users, and all parties can attest to this. Furthermore, the automatic telephone systems installed in the Chinese and Concession areas are different, and the two sides cannot directly operate together. This call charge was considered appropriate by all parties when the contract was signed, and it will continue to be applied.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau's Narcotics Suppression Section Suggests Establishing Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Hospital</h3>
<p>To Accommodate Addicts Forced into Rehabilitation During Mandatory Registration, Before Establishment, Negotiating to Borrow Caojing Prison for Temporary Detention</p>
<p>In order to vigorously prohibit narcotics and urge addicts to register promptly, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with the Narcotics Suppression Committee, has dispatched personnel to various districts to hold open-air lectures since the 16th of this month. Dai Li-zhen, Section Chief of the Bureau's Addict Registration Section, believes that the deadline for voluntary registration is approaching, and there will inevitably be omissions and concealed situations. When mandatory registration begins, those who should be arrested according to law will be numerous. The existing Hu-nan and Hu-bei hospitals may not be sufficient to accommodate them. Therefore, he specifically suggested to Director Cai that he transfer a letter to the Health Bureau to establish a temporary rehabilitation hospital to facilitate accommodation. His proposal states: "Since the second dispatch of personnel from this bureau to conduct investigations, the number of addicts found by various sub-bureaus, together with the number from the previous investigation, totals approximately 13,000 to 14,000 people. The number of addicts registered according to regulations has reached over 10,000, which is already quite a few. However, given the density of the population in this city, and the huge volume of opium sales, the number of addicts may be more than this. It is expected that there are still many people who have been omitted or concealed. In the future, when mandatory registration begins, these unregistered addicts will inevitably be strictly searched and arrested, and fined 50 to 300 yuan according to regulations, and then ordered to register. Most of the addicts in this city are poor. In the future, the number of addicts who are found but cannot pay the fines or are unable to obtain a license will inevitably be large. These addicts should be sent to a drug rehabilitation hospital and ordered to break their addiction. The number of addicts admitted to drug rehabilitation hospitals in this city is at most 20 to 30 people per day. From July to the present, the total number of people treated in the Hu-nan and Hu-bei rehabilitation hospitals is only over 1,000. During the mandatory registration period, this bureau will strictly arrest addicts. Even in one day, it can detain more than 1,000 people. If the majority of addicts cannot pay the fines or are unable to find bail, this bureau cannot release them immediately and will inevitably take ordering rehabilitation as a last resort. The number of people undergoing rehabilitation will increase, and the Hu-nan and Hu-bei hospitals will not be able to accommodate them in time. The bureau's detention center can accommodate a maximum of 300 addicts. If the number increases, it will be impossible to detain them. It is proposed to send a letter to the Health Bureau requesting it to establish a temporary drug rehabilitation hospital capable of accommodating 500 people to accommodate addicts forced into rehabilitation during the mandatory registration period. Before this drug rehabilitation hospital is established, it is proposed to negotiate with the local court to temporarily borrow a part of the Caojing Prison to temporarily detain the addicts temporarily detained by this bureau. Once the drug rehabilitation hospital has vacant rooms, they will be sent for rehabilitation separately. All the food for the temporarily detained prisoners will be the responsibility of this bureau and will be paid from the addicts' fines. It is proposed to report to the municipal government for record first."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Begins Seafarer Examinations</h3>
<p>Held Specifically at Wusong Merchant Marine School, Unregistered Seafarers May Continue to Register</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' seafarer certification examinations are being held in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou this time to facilitate examinations for seafarers. The Shanghai examination has already begun on the 16th. A reporter from the Datong News Agency recorded the following details:</p>
<p>Commencement of Examinations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has specially sent Wu Ying-hui, Section Chief of the Maritime Affairs Section, to Shanghai to preside over the Shanghai part of the seafarer certification examinations, together with He Dao-yun, Section Chief of the Examination Section of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau. The examinations began on the 16th at the Wusong Merchant Marine School and will end on the 10th of next month. A total of 26 Chinese and foreign seafarers have registered and have been scheduled for examinations separately.</p>
<p>Seafarers Under Examination</p>
<p>The names and native places of the Chinese and foreign seafarers who have registered with the Maritime Affairs Bureau for the examination are as follows: Chen Jing-shi (Songjiang), Dai Rong-rui (Yinxian), Zhang Zeng-yan (Anhui), Yue Song-nian (Zhenhai), Chen Chun-yang (Yinxian), Kai Xing Ni Lin-gu (Russia), Hu Long-fang (Guangdong), Guo Deng-shi (Zhejiang), Shi Yan-tang (Yinxian), Hong Chang-gen (Dinghai), Yu A-yao (Zhenhai), Jiang Ming-sheng (Shanghai), Zhang Zhi-he (Chongming), Wu Shi-cheng (Chongming), Chen Qi-lin (Yinxian), Wang Hong-yuan (Yinxian), Tong Zhong-zhi (Ninghai), Huang Chong-fu (Jiangsu), Fan Wu-liang (Dinghai), Zheng Shi-chun (Zhenhai), Zhu Wen-bing (Shanghai), Qu Tuo-na (Norway), Xu Yin-fu (Yinxian), Lin Qiu-kang, Hu Nian-zai, Lin Rong-tang.</p>
<p>Continued Registration</p>
<p>In addition to the seafarers who have already registered, the Ministry of Communications, considering that there are many steamships and even more seafarers in the country, and fearing that there may still be omissions, has specially extended the registration period from October 20th to December 15th. This one-month extension is to provide an opportunity for seafarers who have not yet taken the examination to register. If they do not take the examination after this period, it will be difficult to make up for it, and they will be dealt with according to law when the certificates are checked in the future.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Bank Continues to Distribute 40% of Debts</h3>
<p>Still Limited to Savings Department Debts, Urging Debtors to Repay as Soon as Possible</p>

It is now decided to continue distributing 40% of the Savings Department debts starting from October 19th. The liquidators of the bank, Shen Jia-zhen, Jiang Wan-ping, the accountants Dong Chun-biao, Dong Chi, and the lawyers Jiang Yi-ping and Shen Zhao-jiu, hereby announce as follows: "The Savings Department debts of this bank were previously distributed at 15% starting from August 10th. It is now decided to continue distributing 40% of the Savings Department debts every day from October 19th, from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM (except Saturday afternoons and Sundays) at Jiang Accountant Firm, No. 149 Sichuan Road, Shanghai. It is hoped that all Savings Department creditors will bring their debt certificates to the above time and address to collect their money. Furthermore, many debtors still owe debts to this bank and have not repaid them. This is a stern reminder to repay them immediately to avoid legal action."</p>
<h3>Shao Ji-yue, Chief Accountant of the Fujian Stamp Tax and Tobacco Bureau, Will Go to Fujian to Take Office</h3>

<h3>Record of the Trial of the Zou Xiao-san-zi Case for the Murder of Yan Shi-fu: The Motive for Murder was to Avenge his Sister-in-Law</h3>
<p>Yan Shi-xiang (also known as Yan Qi), a native of Suqian, was lured to the vicinity of the Meifu Wharf in Peidong at 7:00 PM on April 10th of this year and killed with a knife. Afterwards, his brother Yan Shi-hong reported to the Procuratorate of the Local Court that his brother was murdered by Zou Xiao-san-zi and his accomplices Huang San-ma and Qian Jia-chun, who lured Yan Shi-xiang out of Pu-dong under the pretext of selling cloth and murdered him. They stole 300 yuan from Yan Shi-xiang. He requested justice in this case. After receiving the report, the court ordered the police to arrest Zou Xiao-san-zi and found blood-stained clothes and a murder weapon at Zou's residence. After prosecutor Wu interrogated Zou and confirmed the facts, he filed a lawsuit with the criminal court. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Tan Zhuo-hong opened a court hearing to investigate the case. The plaintiff, Yan Shi-hong, hired lawyer Ni Jiong to attend the court and requested that the 300 yuan stolen be recovered and that compensation of 1,000 yuan be paid. The defendant, Zou Xiao-san-zi, hired lawyer Zha Ren-wei to defend him in court. After the judge took his seat, Yan Shi-hong first stated the previous situation and requested that the law be enforced. The judge ordered Zou Xiao-san-zi, who was in custody, to be brought to the case and asked him, "Although you have admitted to killing Yan Shi-xiang, you have not admitted to robbing 300 yuan. What kind of evidence can you present now?" Zou replied that there was no such thing as yuan. At this point, the defendant's lawyer stated, "The cause of this case is that Zou Xiao-san-zi's sister-in-law was kidnapped by the bandit Yan Shi-xiang in his hometown of Suqian in July of the 20th year of the Republic of China. He demanded 400 yuan for ransom, which was ignored, and she was eventually killed. The fact that the defendant Zou Xiao-san-zi killed Yan to avenge his sister-in-law is very clear. Moreover, your court has sent a public letter to Suqian County to investigate, and last month the county magistrate of Suqian County, Zhang Nai-fan, replied to your court, proving that the defendant's sister-in-law was indeed killed by Yan and others. Please investigate carefully." The judge said that the case involved major discrepancies and that the court would continue to investigate in detail and postpone the retrial. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The home of Indian Nu Bao-ke-xing (transliteration), who lived upstairs in a Western-style clothing store at No. 1033 Fuxu Road in the French Concession, was suddenly invaded by five armed bandits at around 7:00 AM on the 15th. Nu's wife, Pi Sheng-tie-ke (transliteration), disregarded the danger and stepped forward to stop them, which angered the bandits. They opened fire on her, and she was hit in a vital area and immediately fell to the ground and died. Realizing they had caused a major disaster, the robbers did not have time to loot and fled, firing their guns along the way to resist arrest. They wounded two men and one woman who were pedestrians. Police officers chased them to the entrance of No. 209 Maggie Road, killing one robber and arresting one suspect. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the detectives took a pistol from the dead robber's hand, containing five bullet rounds. They also found five bullet rounds in his pocket, loaded in a magazine. The suspect who was arrested gave his name as Li Guo-xiang, 32 years old, living at No. 4 Guba Road, making a living by pulling rickshaws. The next day, the police handed Li over to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Zhang Chao-zuo interrogated him. Police lawyer Fei Xi-zhen explained the case and requested an extension for investigation before filing charges. Detective Lu Lian-liang reported the circumstances of the defendant's arrest and presented the bullets found in his possession. When questioned, Li claimed that he heard the sound of robbers that morning and went to watch. He now pulls a rickshaw for a certain family on Jing'an Temple Road and would not dare to engage in illegal activities. The court ordered that the hearing be postponed to the 25th and that the defendant be returned to custody.</p>

Xie Gui-qing, Xie Wei-qing's paternal uncle, who is 61 years old and very poor, lives in the residence. Last year, Gui-qing asked Wei-qing to introduce his son You-tuo to a business, and he was recommended to work as an apprentice in the sock department of the China National Products Company. Because there was no salary, Wei-qing subsidized Gui-qing with 10 yuan per month. However, on June 18th of this year, at 10:00 AM, Zhu-qing went to No. 15, Lane 68, Sichuan Road to collect the 10 yuan subsidy. Accountant Shen Ji-chen, Division Clerk Xu De-shen illegally detained him. At 8:00 PM, he was twisted into the General Police Station and detained for two hours.

Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xie-fen opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. First, Xie Gui-qing stated the situation at the time. When Xie Wei-qing was questioned, he claimed that he was not present at the time, so he did not know. Then, witnesses Shen Ji-chen and Xu De-shen testified that the plaintiff had occupied the office from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM and was still unwilling to leave, even wanting to stay in the accounting office. Because the accounting office was very important, they advised him to go out. If he wanted to borrow money, he could come back another day. However, the plaintiff firmly refused to leave, so they called the police. After Judge Xiao questioned both parties, he ordered the debate to begin and then announced the verdict that Xie Wei-qing, namely Xie Wei-qing, was not guilty.</p>

<h3>Chen Jinlan's Second Attempt to Escape: Court Interrogates Yesterday, All Involved Suspects Questioned, Origin of Saw Focus of Case</h3>
<p>The murderer Yongren Chen Jinlan, previously escaped from the Special No. 2 Court Detention Center while appealing his case. After being recaptured, he was sentenced for escaping and sent to the Special No. 2 Prison. Recently, Chen attempted to escape again within the prison, acquiring a saw to cut through his shackles and the iron bars of his cell door. Using bedsheets twisted into a rope, he was preparing to act on the night of the 13th at 10 PM, when he was about to burst out of the prison gate and was discovered by guard Xi Keyuan, who reported to the director, who in turn reported to the superiors. Chen and three suspected inmates, Ji Jinquan and Xu Xinbao, were transferred to the Special No. 2 Court Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor, Wang Ren, opened court in the afternoon before yesterday to interrogate them. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday at noon, Prosecutor Wang continued the hearing and questioned the guards Chen Rensheng and Zhao Qi, who testified that Ji Jinquan had good conduct in prison and was unlikely to have supplied Chen Jinlan with the hacksaw for the escape. When Chen was questioned, he still claimed that the saw was provided by Ji, but Ji vehemently denied it. The court adjourned for further questioning in the afternoon. At 3 PM in the afternoon, Prosecutor Wang ordered the questioning of inmate Chen Liangen, No. 673, and inmate Fu Zilong, No. 606, who had knowledge of the case, and brought in Chen and Ji for interrogation in the Fifth Court. First, Chen Liangen testified that he was sentenced to nine years for theft and was transferred to Cell No. 1 on the fourth floor of Cell Block A for violating workshop rules. He knew Chen Jinlan, who was in the same cell. He stayed in Cell No. 1 for a month and then requested a transfer to work carrying rice between cells. He knew Ji Jinquan, who cleaned windows and floors on the fourth floor with glue, and is now working on the third floor. He did not see Chen with a saw in Chen's cell. Fu Zilong testified that he was sentenced to five years for theft by the French Concession Court and sent to Cell Block A, Room No. 21 on the fourth floor of the prison in the mainland. He did not know Chen before, and only knew him after he entered the prison. About a month ago, inmate Feng Xiangfa, No. 1024, told him during outdoor exercise that Chen Jinlan had asked him to buy a saw after his release from prison and hide it in a bar of soap to give to Chen during visiting hours. He advised Feng against it, saying it was related to him and he would be in trouble with the law. Feng was sentenced to four months for theft and has been out of prison for nearly a month. Feng told him that he lived at No. 4 Yicheng Lane, Jiaxi Road, and asked him to visit him after he was released from prison. Feng gave Chen Jinlan a set of short shirt and pants when he was released. He did not know whether Feng helped Chen or where Chen's saw came from. When Chen was questioned, he denied Fu's testimony and still claimed that the saw was provided by Xi. Xi continued to testify as before. At this point, the court ordered Chen, Xi, Chen, and Fu to be sent back to prison to await prosecution. The night before last, Chen Xinlan and Xi Jinxiang were detained in the detention center. The warden paid special attention to Chen because he had escaped before and been recaptured. In addition to shackles, both Chen and Xi were handcuffed and ordered to be closely guarded to prevent accidents. Therefore, when Chen and Xi were brought to court yesterday afternoon, they were still handcuffed and shackled, with the sound of iron chains. After the interrogation, they were sent back to prison to serve their sentences. It is expected that in this prosecution, Chen's sentence will be more severe than the last time he escaped.</p>

<h3>Wife of Flower Club King Suddenly Reports Suspicious Robbery, Police Investigation Finds No Trace, Now Sued in Court for False Accusation</h3>
<p>Wang Manman, a Shanghai native, 25 years old, who used to work as a dancer in dance halls such as Dahua and Dadong, and lives at No. 10, Tongchun Lane, Zhejiang Road, is the wife of Liu Lianghong, the Flower Club King who was assassinated five years ago. She is addicted to opium and has been fined twice by the court. At 3:55 AM yesterday, Wang suddenly shouted "Robbery!" at a small tea market on Dagu Road. Patrol officer No. 1930 nearby rushed to the scene. According to Wang, she had been robbed of jewelry worth 289 yuan. The patrol officer took Wang to the Chengdu Road Police Station to report. After an investigation by Chinese Detective Wang Xichang, Wang stated that she had gone to the newly moved residence of Manli and Wang Xiaomei, who were also dancers, at No. 14 Ma'an Lane, Dagu Road, with Wang's lover to play cards. She was planning to go home when, at a small vegetable market on Dagu Road, Liu Lianghong's friend, Little Ningbo of the Flower Club, and another unknown person blocked her way. Little Ningbo held a pistol and asked to borrow 50 yuan from her. When she refused, they forcibly robbed her of 2.2 yuan in silver, a watch, and a diamond ring from her purse, totaling 289 yuan. They then jumped into a gray-white car with license plate No. 13031 and fled. The detectives immediately investigated according to Wang's statement. They found that the car with license plate No. 13031 was owned by Liu, an officer residing at No. 314 Zhaojia Road, and the car was black, not gray-white. They also went to No. 14 Ma'an Lane, Dagu Road, to investigate, but no one in the house knew Wang Manman. The detectives suspected that this matter was confusing and Wang was falsely accusing someone, so they detained her. Wang then suddenly claimed that she went to Ma'an Lane to smoke opium. At 9 AM yesterday, she was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous events, prosecuted her for false accusation, and stated that the police station requested a postponement because the facts were still unclear. Wang Manman insisted that she was indeed robbed and that Little Ningbo was also seen while watching the play. As for the stolen watch, it was pawned by the wife of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, and she redeemed it for 34 yuan. When the Chinese detectives came, she did not want to go to the police station, but the detectives insisted on going to the police station with her. She was not falsely accusing anyone. Judge Liu Yugui ordered a postponement for further investigation, and Wang Manman was released on bail pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Shi Family's Daughter-in-Law and Father-in-Law in Endless Litigation: From Mediation to Criminal and Civil Lawsuits, Shi Yongkang Implicates Wang Baofeng</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Court yesterday afternoon heard a case in which a widow demanded separation from her father-in-law and mother-in-law. The daughter-in-law and father-in-law slandered each other in court. The daughter-in-law accused the father-in-law of breaking into her room late at night and raping her, while the father-in-law accused the daughter-in-law of being frivolous, being touched by someone in the store and not feeling ashamed. The situation was quite interesting. The record of the interrogation is as follows: Shi Ye Cuiying, a young woman from Ningbo, 22 years old, married Ahe, the son of Shi Yongkang, the owner of the Shiyukang cigarette paper shop at the intersection of Yinggong Temple Road, Penglai Road, in this city, at the age of 17. She has two sons, the eldest is six years old, and the youngest is only four years old. Ahe opened a new store on Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen, and the couple lived together there. After Ahe died of illness, Ye Cuiying moved to the old store on Penglai Road. Recently, Shi Ye Cuiying filed a petition in the mediation court of the District Court to separate from her father-in-law and mother-in-law, and accused her father-in-law of indecent behavior. As a result, the mediation failed. When leaving the court, Shi Yongkang twisted his daughter-in-law to the prosecutor's office, accusing her of intentionally slandering and damaging his reputation. After the interrogation, the prosecutor did not prosecute Ye Cuiying. On the one hand, Shi Ye Cuiying hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to formally sue the court for separation. At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Han Jingdou opened the Sixth Court for interrogation. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were present in court as summoned. First, Shi Ye Cuiying stated that her husband died two years ago, and on the night of August 12th of this year, her father-in-law broke into her room and raped her. Because she was unwilling to be humiliated, she returned to her mother's house at No. 70 Wanyu Street, Wangjia Pier, the next day. She is now seeking separation and that her gold jewelry was exchanged by her father-in-law when she opened the new store, and she should be asked to return 290 yuan. Next, Shi Yongkang, 48 years old, from Ningbo, stated that his daughter-in-law has always been well-behaved. Since June of this year, Wang Baofeng, the owner of the Wang Baoji store across the street, has come to the store and touched and flirted with his daughter-in-law. He criticized him for not flirting with the widow, which caused them to resent and falsely accuse him of raping his daughter-in-law, which is a blood-spitting accusation that makes people embarrassed. He asked for an investigation. Finally, Shi Zhang stated, 44 years old, Ye Cuiying is her daughter-in-law. Since June of this year, her daughter-in-law has suddenly changed her usual behavior. Wang Baofeng, a neighbor, often comes to the store under the pretext of buying cigarettes, and her daughter-in-law laughs and teases with him in the store. At about 2 PM on August 12th, she returned from outside and saw Wang Baofeng touching her daughter-in-law's chest. She told her husband and negotiated with Wang. At this point, she presented several kinds of medicines and flesh-colored silk stockings given by Wang to her daughter-in-law as evidence and asked for an investigation. The questioning officer examined them and asked Ye Cuiying for further interrogation. Ye replied that she had a heartache and Wang Baofeng gave her the medicine. As for the silk stockings, they were bought by her father-in-law. She had no relationship with Wang. She asked for an investigation. The questioning officer obtained the confession and ordered a postponement for further trial because there was a need to summon witnesses and investigate.</p>
<h3>Lu Ruifang Sues His Father to Confirm Paternity: Previously Separated Due to Disagreement, Now Hopes to Return Home Because His Father is Old</h3>
<p>Lu Weiyong, a comprador of Jardine Matheson, is over 60 years old. His son Ruifang, born to his first wife, is now 35 years old and lives at No. 29 Yuli, south of the First Special District Court, North Zhejiang Road. His mother passed away when he was eight years old, and his father remarried. At the age of 18, his parents arranged his marriage. Soon after, because he did not please his parents, Lu Weiyong wrote a statement severing their relationship, giving him 10,000 yuan and agreeing that he would not covet the property in the future. From then on, Ruifang took his wife and lived separately from his parents. However, Weiyong initially subsidized him with dozens of yuan per month to help his son and daughter-in-law maintain their livelihood, but after two years, the money stopped. Since then, there has been no contact for more than ten years. Now that Lu Ruifang sees that his father is getting old and has a lot of property, he is eager to restore his original father-son relationship. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Lu Weiyong in the First Special District Court to confirm the relationship. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo Chongtai opened the court for interrogation, but the defendant did not appear. According to his lawyer, the defendant is now 63 years old and has never been involved in litigation with anyone in his life. He did not expect to be sued by his son now, and he was so angry that he became ill and could not appear in court. However, the defendant did not deny the father-son relationship. The plaintiff Lu Ruifang stated that he had repeatedly written to the defendant asking him to acknowledge him as his son, but he did not receive a reply. Then, he submitted a presentation to the mediation court and requested mediation, but the defendant also did not appear in court, so he filed a lawsuit. If he had already expressed his acknowledgement, there would be no need for litigation. He also recounted the past events of writing the statement. After the debate between the lawyers of both parties, the court ordered that the verdict be announced on the afternoon of the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Promotes Academics, Reduces Pigeon Transportation Fees, Effective November 11th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zoo established a pigeon research association in August of this year. Because pigeons need to be taken to various places at any time to train for flight speed, the zoo requested the Training Directorate General to consult with the Ministry of Railways to reduce transportation fees. The Ministry of Railways believes that pigeons are related to national defense transportation and are different from ordinary pigeons. In order to promote academic research, transportation fees can be reduced appropriately within the scope of not losing road administration to show encouragement. It ordered Shan Gailu to investigate and report the transportation of pigeons in the past and the content of the pigeon research association. Now, Ministry Order No. 8825 states that pigeons (limited to those of the Shanghai Zoo pigeon research association) should be transported by passenger car or train, and those with accurate certification from the pigeon research association should be subject to a uniform 50% reduction in transportation fees, effective from November 11th of this year, for a period of one year. The bureau has already instructed the traffic department to comply with this order.</p>

<h3>Truth of Blood Case Revealed: Luo Yusheng Claims to Avenge His Father, Luo Yan Believes His Father Zhaoxin's Death is Related to Jin Dai, So He Discussed with Xu Wenxian to Kill Her and Retrieve Her Property, Yesterday's Debate Concluded and Sentencing Scheduled for Next Thursday</h3>
<p>Jin Dai, a woman residing at No. 459 North Henan Road (wife of the late former Ningbo District Court Prosecutor Jin Zhaoluan), and her maid Luo Guo, were suddenly assassinated with a sharp axe at 8:10 AM on September 23rd of this year. Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective Zhao Qingkui of the Huishi Police Station arrested Luo Yusheng, a teacher at Mingchen Elementary School, who was sent to the First Special Court. After several interrogations, although Luo confessed to the murder at the police station, he firmly denied it in court. The judge, in order to understand the truth, did not tire of seeking details. A few days ago, the presiding judge Liu Yugui, accompanied by the clerk, police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin, and Chinese and Western detectives, took the defendant Luo Yusheng to the scene of the incident to investigate. Luo gave a detailed account of the murder at the time, as if it were painted. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the date for the continued hearing of this case arrived, and many men and women were listening. After Judge Liu ascended to the public office, police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin began by stating that the court had ordered the seized pair of yellow leather shoes to be examined. The police station immediately complied with the order and sent them to the Lester Medical Research Institute on Awenyi Road for testing. The result was that there was no blood on the leather shoes, but there were traces of scraping with a blade on the soles. All the witnesses Li Jianxing and Chinese Police No. 3370, who were present at the time of the investigation, have arrived in court. The two witnesses then appeared in court, affirmed and testified that they were all present at the time of the investigation and heard the defendant's confession correctly. The defendant Luo Yusheng confessed everything, saying that he knew his accomplice Xu Wenxian, and Ma was invited by Xu. The day before the incident, they first discussed the plan in my school. Xu suggested using an axe to chop them to death. So, on the morning of the 23rd, Xu and Ma each took an axe to Jin's house. I was on the second floor next to the stairs, watching the wind. Xu and Ma went upstairs. Soon after, Ma went downstairs and said that the person had been killed. Then, he and Xu went back first. Then, I went up to the third floor, took out the items from the night pot box, wrapped them in the newspaper of the day, took them back to the school, packed them in a suitcase, and sent them to Wang Mingrong's house at No. 14 Jiu'an Lane, Huangjia Que, which had been rented in advance. However, this action was entirely to avenge my father, because after my father Luo Zhaoxin was killed, all of my father's property was taken away by Jin Dai, and I suspected that my father's death was related to Jin, so after discussing with Xu Wenxian, I killed her and retrieved my father's property. Judge Liu believed that the facts of the case were clear and ordered the debate to begin. First, police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin expressed his opinion and prosecuted. After investigating the confessions of all parties in several court sessions, the defendant committed robbery and murder in violation of Article 332 of the Criminal Law and should be sentenced to death. Then, defendant's lawyers Xu Jie and Zhang Sijie debated one after another, requesting leniency. Jin Yongxi, Yongzhen, and Lingyi, the children of the deceased Jin Dai, knelt down and asked for justice. Lawyer Cheng Shangfeng, hired by the family of the victim, stood up and brought a civil lawsuit, demanding that the defendant be ordered to pay the funeral expenses and compensation for Jin Dai and Luo Guo, totaling 4,000 yuan. Finally, the defendant Luo Yusheng laughed and confessed that his actions were entirely for revenge and had no purpose of greed for money. Therefore, all the obtained passbooks, etc., were not moved at all. At that time, I only instructed Xu and Ma to go to kill Jin Dai alone. The killing of the maid Luo Guo was entirely Xu's free action. After my father was killed, I received a letter stating that it was done by someone named Zhang. Now that Zhang has not been arrested, and it is not known whether he exists, and after checking the handwriting in the letter, it seemed to be from Jin Dai, which made the suspicion even greater. Therefore, the heart of revenge was never forgotten. For a year, there was no opportunity, but now with the help of Xu and others, the goal was achieved. Judge Liu verified the confession and ordered the debate on this case to be concluded, and the sentence will be pronounced next Thursday afternoon. The defendant was remanded to the police station.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Special Committee Discusses Rickshaw Issues: Drivers Must Wear Badges Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Special Committee recently convened a meeting to discuss the report of the Rickshaw Management Office. The minutes of the meeting have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors. Now, we will select the important items from the Management Office's report and record their general outline as follows. Regarding the issue of self-owned rickshaw pullers' donation of licenses, the current licenses expired on September 30th. The Rickshaw Management Office now specifically recommends that self-owned rickshaw pullers be re-registered starting from November 1st, and licenses be issued. The license fee will be 50 cents for the entire year of the Republic of China 25. Furthermore, each registered driver will be given a new porcelain arm badge. Starting from January 1st of the following year, drivers without a license and arm badge will not be allowed to engage in the rickshaw pulling business. According to the report of the Rickshaw Management Office, there are now 345 new-style rickshaws on the market. After the introduction of these new vehicles, dilapidated old vehicles have been gradually abandoned. On average, about 200 dilapidated old vehicles are abandoned each month. Regarding the registration of public rickshaw drivers, according to the report of the Rickshaw Management Office, approximately 41,000 people have been registered and licensed. After the first registration deadline, 4,909 rickshaw drivers who had not been registered and licensed have been given as much opportunity as possible to register and obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations, and most of them have already done so. The Rickshaw Management Office also proposes that starting from November 1st, public rickshaw drivers who have not obtained a license and do not have an arm badge will not be allowed to engage in the rickshaw pulling business. According to the Management Office's opinion, drivers have been given as much opportunity and considerable time for hesitation. It is now inconvenient to delay this matter any longer. Therefore, it has been decided to handle it in accordance with the regulations to ensure uniformity. This matter has been agreed upon by the Rickshaw Special Committee and submitted to the Board of Directors for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Carters Mutual Aid Association: Minutes of the Board Meeting. Association Affairs Increasingly Prosperous in Recent Months; Carters Representatives to Elect Directors Soon</h3>
<p>On the 15th of this month, the Carters Mutual Aid Association held its 23rd board meeting at its general headquarters on Jiaxing Road. Chairman Mr. Mac oversaw the meeting. All directors attended except for Gu Songmao and Yan Chengde, who were excused due to prior commitments. The meeting began with a discussion of the association's business report for September, which was immediately approved. According to the report, the number of carters visiting the association's facilities for bathing was exceptionally high, reaching over 27,500 people. The number of residents in the dormitory has gradually increased, averaging 240 people per day. Other relief and visitation work has become increasingly busy. In terms of medical care, the number of people seeking medical attention in September reached over 14,600. Next, the meeting discussed the minutes and recommendations of various committees, which were generally approved with slight modifications. Among the most important issues were the education of carters' children, group insurance for carters, and medical care for carters. Regarding the insurance issue, since its emergence, various insurance companies in Shanghai have been competing fiercely. The Mutual Aid Association plans to first establish standard conditions and then invite various companies to bid for the insurance contract. Regarding medical care, the Mutual Aid Association, recognizing the growing development of its medical services, has decided to hire two more physicians with extensive knowledge and two nurses. It is anticipated that with the addition of staff, physicians will be able to visit carters' homes for treatment when necessary, saving patients the hardship of travel. Furthermore, in September, a total of 150 carters and 250 family members who were found to be unfit for work were assisted by the Mutual Aid Association in returning to their hometowns. Approximately 200 people received other forms of relief. The Mutual Aid Association provides assistance to all carters who are unable to make a living and seek relief, without exception. In addition, regarding the election of two carter representative directors to the Mutual Aid Association, the numbers of 400 carter voters have already been drawn. The date for the election of representative directors by carters has been set for the 24th of this month. At that time, Mr. Yao Huimo, Deputy Chief of the Police Department of the Public Works Department, will be present to supervise the election.</p>
<h3>New Fixed Prices for Thermos Bottles to Be Implemented Periodically. Starting from the 21st of This Month, the Shanghai Thermos Bottle Manufacturers Association, in View of the Endless Infighting Among Manufacturers and the Imminent Bankruptcy of the Newly Emerging Domestic Products, Convened a Meeting of Manufacturers to Resolve the Issue, Reorganize Market Prices, and Establish Uniform Pricing, to Be Implemented Starting from the 21st of This Month. The Following Is a Record of Their Notice and New Price List.</h3>
<p>Notice to Fellow Manufacturers</p>
<p>The Association, in view of the fact that fellow manufacturers in the city are constantly engaged in infighting, each pursuing their own interests, even to the extent of sacrificing capital and engaging in reckless dumping, leading to market chaos, a sharp decline in business, and increasing obstacles to the future, believes that if measures are not taken quickly to rectify the situation, complete bankruptcy is imminent. Therefore, it convened all members for several discussions and publicly decided to set minimum market prices, which have been submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for approval and filing, with instructions for implementation. It is hoped that all fellow manufacturers in the city, whether members or non-members, will strictly comply with the above-mentioned prices and refrain from privately reducing prices and engaging in dumping (prices exceeding this fixed amount are not subject to this rule). If anyone is found to be insincere or to violate these regulations, they will be severely punished in accordance with industry rules. All are urged to pay attention and abide by these rules, and not to bring trouble upon themselves. This is our hope.</p>
<p>New Monthly Price List</p>
<p>Shanghai Thermos Bottle Manufacturers Association, New Minimum Price List: Two-pound white iron new floral thermos bottle, 5.9 yuan per dozen; two-pound white iron chongxi thermos bottle, 5.6 yuan per dozen; two-pound black iron chongxi thermos bottle, 5.3 yuan per dozen; adding a handle adds a minimum of 0.2 yuan per dozen; bottle cores in boxes, 2.5 yuan per dozen; prices for patterned goods are to be determined and added as appropriate. The above prices, regardless of wholesale or retail transactions, are subject to a 10% discount. Cash sales receive an additional 2% discount. Payment periods should not exceed ten days. It is also stipulated that all prices will be implemented starting on October 21, 1935.</p>

<h3>Huang Xianyao and Others Accused of Damaging Credit Rights Case Concludes; Sentencing Set for the 24th</h3>
<p>Huang Xianyao, the second son of the late wealthy merchant Huang Chu Jiu, founder of the Ri Ye Bank and the Great World amusement center, and his father-in-law, Zhou Songqing, were previously sued in the Second Criminal Court by Wang Shaozeng and other creditors of the Gongfa Company, represented by lawyers Xu Yannian and others, for allegedly damaging credit rights. Huang repeatedly avoided appearing in court. Only Zhou Songqing appeared in court with his defense lawyer, Wu Zhiping, and denied issuing a note guaranteeing Huang's assets. When Huang was arrested, the court dispatched personnel to retrieve the original note from a safety deposit box at the Guohua Bank. Zhou then filed a complaint with the French Concession Police against Huang Xianyao for forging documents. Huang was taken into custody for investigation. Huang then confessed that he had conspired with lawyer Mi Jingshen and his clerk Wu Jiajin to forge the note and defraud his father-in-law of money. After the police identified the forgery, they filed charges of forgery against Huang in the First Special Court. The civil suit was then suspended. Subsequently, the public prosecution concluded, and Huang was sentenced to one year in prison for forgery, with a two-year suspended sentence. Later, the civil suit for damaging property rights was heard by Judge Sun Peng of the Second Special Court. This newspaper has previously reported on the hearings and postponements. Yesterday, the case was heard again. The plaintiffs, Wang Shaozeng and others, along with their attorneys Xu Yannian, Bian Jialu, and Dong Yu, appeared in court. The two defendants, Huang and Zhou, also appeared with their defense lawyers. Judge Sun briefly questioned both parties and, finding the case to be clear, ordered the commencement of arguments. The plaintiffs' lawyers argued that the note in question had initially been examined by a panel of five experts appointed by the court, who had determined that it was indeed written by Zhou Songqing. The plaintiffs argued that they did not believe the later determination by the French Concession Police that the note was not written by Zhou was correct. They pointed out that the French Concession Police examiner, Rao Boze, was French and only had investigative experience, lacking knowledge of Chinese calligraphy. Therefore, they argued that his examination should not be considered credible and requested a legal judgment. Zhou Songqing's defense lawyer argued that the police had already thoroughly examined the note, initiated a public prosecution, and sentenced Huang Xianyao for the crime. He stated that Zhou's innocence had already been revealed and requested that the court declare Zhou Songqing not guilty. Huang Xianyao's defense lawyer argued that Huang had hired lawyer Mi to handle a case regarding cohabitation with his wife. Huang had been misled by Mi and Wu, who falsely claimed that there would be no benefit from requesting his wife to cohabit with him. They then proposed forging the note to obtain money from his father-in-law. However, Huang had never seen the note and had only seen a photograph of it. He argued that he had been deceived and implicated and that he had already been sentenced in the public prosecution. Based on the principle of double jeopardy, he requested that the civil suit be dismissed. After reviewing the arguments, the court declared the proceedings concluded and scheduled sentencing for the 24th. The defendants remained on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Sixteen-Year-Old Robber: Steals a Gold Wooden Fish, Injuring a Child's Arm; Also, Smokes Heroin in Cigarettes</h3>
<p>A local woman, Zhu Chen, 25 years old, living inside the Great South Gate, took her child to burn incense at the Chenghuang Temple yesterday morning at 11:20. As she was walking near Fangbang Road, a man and a boy followed her. They cut the gold wooden fish off the child's arm with a razor blade. Because the child's arm was fleshy, the rope was embedded in the flesh, making it difficult to cut. This caused the child's arm to be cut open, and blood flowed profusely. However, the gold wooden fish was not stolen. The woman cried out for help. Police officer Cheng Fuhai caught the boy, but the robber escaped. The boy was taken to the Chenghuang Temple Police Station for questioning. According to the boy, Shen Xingfa, from Ningbo, 12 years old, living at 13 Huade Road, confessed to conspiring with another robber, Xiaojiangbei, to steal the plaintiff's child's gold wooden fish. Three packets of heroin were found on Shen Xingfa. When asked what the drugs were for, he confessed that he and his accomplice put them in cigarettes to smoke for pleasure. The police chief, Liu, found it extremely audacious that a 12-year-old would engage in such outrageous behavior and ordered him to be sent to the General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Suddenly Grabbed and Wept: Zhu Zhang Accuses Tian Baozhang; The Truth Is Not Difficult to Ascertain</h3>
<p>Tian Baozhang, 34 years old, from Zhenjiang, a tea server at the East Asia Hotel, Room 59, third floor, of the Xianshi Company, was visiting relatives at the Wang Jingyuan Hardware Store on Minquan Road the other day. As he stood in the doorway, he was grabbed by Ding Zhang, a 29-year-old woman from Anhui (newly arrived in Shanghai from her hometown), who refused to let go and wailed, claiming that Tian had brought her to Shanghai from her hometown and abandoned her halfway. Tian flatly denied this, saying that she had mistaken him. Zhang Xiaoshan, officer number 22, arrived and took them both to the Old North Gate Police Station for questioning. According to the plaintiff's statement, she made the same claim as above, stating that she was living in a foreign land with no relatives and that the defendant was heartless. According to the defendant's statement, he had never been to Anhui, so how could he have brought her to Shanghai from her hometown? The police chief said that the case involved accusations of abandonment and abduction and ordered him to be sent to the Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Haichang Road</h3>
<p>At around 7 p.m. last night, four robbers suddenly came to the home of Jiang Jixiang, located upstairs at No. 4 Anji Lane, Haichang Road, Zhabei. The robbers, wearing short blue-black cloth shirts and speaking with a Jiangbei accent, threatened them with handguns and forbade them from making a sound. They ransacked the house and stole 95 yuan in banknotes. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled in different directions. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Xinzha Branch Bureau, requesting an arrest. After receiving the report, the Bureau immediately reported the incident to the Supervisory Office of the Public Security Bureau and ordered the investigation team to strictly arrest the thieves and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>The Xinwei Relief Society Sends Off a Large Number of Refugees</h3>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Society has successively sent off over 5,000 refugees, men, women, and children, since May of this year. Because a continuous stream of disaster victims from various provinces have gathered at the main entrance, requesting to be sent to Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places, the executives Chen Youtang and Ge Yunxun have been counting the number of people, issuing free ship tickets, and escorting them on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an ship to various ports along the Yangtze River this morning at about 5:00 a.m. A total of over 100 people were sent off, and they will be taken care of by the local Public Security Bureaus.</p>

He reported the incident to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which dispatched detective Zhou Yushan and apprehended the perpetrator, Zhang Yunlong, from Chongming. He was sent to the First Special Court. The details of his confession have been reported in this newspaper. The court ordered him to await sentencing.

Graduates who have served in society have been trusted by all sectors. In recent years, the number of students from far and near who have come to study at the school has been increasing day by day.

Since moving, the school has been making further improvements, hiring more teachers, increasing the number of classes, emphasizing serious teaching, and striving for complete equipment. The number of students has increased sharply this semester, so the school buildings are again insufficient.

<h3>Anecdotes of Mr. Xie Fusheng</h3>
<p>— Sun Chouchang</p>
<p>When I perused this newspaper on the morning of the 5th of this month, I suddenly saw on the second page of the cover advertisement the words "Mr. Xie Fusheng passed away due to illness at 2:10 PM on October 4th at his residence." I was still hesitant, wondering if it was not the famous translator of Shanghai, Mr. Xie, who had served as a reporter for this newspaper, or someone with the same name and surname. Although I had not seen him for several months, I would ask about him whenever I met old friends, and learned that he was still working as usual just a week ago. When I saw Mr. Xie's portrait and the headline "Former Newspaper Reporter Xie Fusheng Passes Away" in the local news on the fourth page, I realized that this Xie Fusheng was indeed the old colleague from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. I was stunned and felt a sense of the transience of life! Although Mr. Xie was short in stature, he was still energetic and younger than I. When we worked together, because of his agility and thin face, we all gave him the nickname "Monkey." Who would have thought that after a few years, this monkey would imitate Sun Wukong and steal peaches from heaven? Therefore, I will recount one or two anecdotes of Mr. Xie to express my condolences.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie was not only deeply proficient in English, but also thoroughly understood the writing and languages of other countries. When he was the English Secretary of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, he was always asked to translate international social communications. When the chairman delivered a welcome speech, he would translate it from Chinese to Western languages, and when the guests delivered a thank you speech, he would translate it from Western languages to Chinese. He handled everything himself and was very fluent.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie loved to eat sweets and had a humorous nature. When the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its monthly staff meeting, he would always attend despite being busy. He would bring preserved tangerine peel, milk candy, and other snacks for the guests. Before the meeting started, fearing that his colleagues would become bored from waiting, he would choose interesting English stories to explain to them. This became a habit, and the gentlemen who attended all looked forward to Mr. Xie's entertainment.</p>
<p>In 1926, during the Sun Chuanfang era, the English-language newspaper he ran, the "Public Opinion," lived up to its name, criticizing the rampant lawlessness of the warlords and praising the revolutionary army for not committing the slightest offense. Sun hated him to the bone and secretly ordered Li Baozhang, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, to arrest him and bring him to the military headquarters, intending to accuse him of being a communist and execute him. Fortunately, Yu Qiaqing, Chuan Xiaolian (Fu Shichong, president of the Chamber of Commerce), and others strongly vouched for him to Sun, and he was spared execution, but he was still detained. On New Year's Eve of that year, he was in prison. It is said that he had nothing to do except translate manuscripts and tell foreign stories to the prisoners to relieve their loneliness. He was released after the revolutionary army arrived in Shanghai the following year.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie lived a frugal life, and did not pay attention to the Western suits he wore. Although he did not buy a car, the amount of car fare he spent each month was sometimes more than those who owned cars, because he had too many jobs and had to rent a car to get around because of the long distances. He was very easygoing. He would call a car from a car company to go from place A to place B, and sometimes forget to cancel it. When he realized it, he had been detained for three or four hours, and the car fare had to be paid accordingly. He had many family members and large household expenses, and he was not good at accumulating wealth, so even though he had an income of several hundred yuan, he was still extremely poor. Last week, the Sino-Western Pharmacy asked him to translate "The older, the better" into English. He said Old Fu was being impolite. He made a living by running a newspaper and teaching, and each word had to be translated for two yuan before he could do it. Zhou Bangjun had long admired his name and was willing to pay. Who would have thought that this translation would be his last? Because of the four words "The older, the better," I have become increasingly sad.</p>
<h3>Weighing the Priorities</h3>
<p>— Juanyin</p>
<h3>Lies</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>In this world, people without specialized skills cannot earn a living. Being able to earn money by scolding people is not surprising, as lying is also used as a specialized profession.</p>
<p>If you and your wife want to explore famous mountains and scenic spots, you don't need to bring a "tour guide." It seems that once the famous scenic spots are "detailed," they become boring and cannot evoke a sense of leisure. When you run to the entrance of the mountain, or even before you step on the first stone step, there will be a refined person who smiles and nods to you. You can unhesitatingly entrust the responsibility of "tour guide" to him, which will surely enchant your wife.</p>
<p>Beside the mountain path, there is a fallen stone. He will tell you how a celestial being pushed it down from the top of the mountain with one finger. If there is a hole in the stone, he will painstakingly come up with a story about the "fingernail of the Qianlong Emperor," and will also link "Liu Bowen" to "Qianlong." There is a Land God Temple in the middle of the mountain, and he will also responsibly say: "Lü Dongbin drank tea here. Look, there is a fairy well in the courtyard." He is very serious.</p>
<p>If your wife is happy to listen, you can stand to the side with a smile. If you pride yourself on being clever and expose his loopholes in person, it is not only "unnecessary," but you also cannot say who planted that big pine tree? There is no way to verify it in history either. Fortunately, you are not an archaeologist. Listening to lies is relaxing and not entirely without benefits. At most, after he finishes telling eighteen or thirty-six historical sites, he will ask you to buy a few boxes of local products or a few rubbings from stone tablets.</p>
<p>You must understand that he is a person who makes a living by lying!</p>
<h3>The Misty Record of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The pillow used on the Empress Dowager's kang bed was a very peculiar thing, and it also had some historical connection. Although she seemed very happy and proud on the outside, she inevitably hid a considerable amount of terror in her heart, which she tried her best to conceal and refused to reveal publicly! What exactly was this terror? It was the fear that someone might bribe a capable person to sneak into the palace and assassinate her. This terror was not unfounded: once, someone did sneak into the Summer Palace with great courage, intending to harm the Empress Dowager. At that time, there was bound to be considerable commotion in the palace, and the old lady was inevitably frightened. But after countless soldiers worked hard to search and arrest, the assassin was finally caught and executed on the same day. The matter was quickly concluded; however, the Empress Dowager's courage was shattered from then on. She thought that although she had fortunately escaped the disaster this time, how could she guarantee that it would not happen again next time? So she busied herself adding guards and also modified the pillow she used at night, opening a hole the size of a silver dollar in the middle, running straight through, looking like a small hole for playing golf.</p>
<p>When she slept, she would put one of her ears tightly against this hole; fortunately, this hole was in the middle of the pillow, and when she lay down, it was not difficult to make her left or right ear tightly against it. She believed that this arrangement would allow her to hear all the sounds nearby more clearly. Because I didn't quite believe it, I personally lay down and tried it once (when the Empress Dowager was not around, I had to secretly try everything she used). Perhaps I was dominated by a psychological effect, that's not certain, but my ears seemed to actually feel that the hole in the pillow had a certain effect equal to a megaphone, at least, it was not completely useless.

<p>Whereabouts</p>
<h3>Ginza Nights</h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>The most prosperous corners of Tokyo are the Nihonbashi, Kyobashi, and Ginza in the east, and Shinjuku in the west. Shinjuku only became prosperous after the Great Kanto Earthquake. Although it is not as prosperous as Ginza now, it will at least be able to keep pace with Ginza in the future. Because there is a public prostitution district there, which is an advantage. When taking responsibility for Tokyo, one must talk about Ginza. The Japanese have an unparalleled fondness and interest in Ginza. They praise it as much as London and New York, only lacking a bridge over the Thames and skyscrapers towering into the sky. Venice, Italy, uses rivers as streets and small boats as transportation, and is known worldwide as the "City of Water." So the Japanese praised Ginza as the "City of Land" because the tall buildings on both sides are like riverbanks. Cars come and go, like small boats in Venice, weaving back and forth. In short, the Japanese want to promote Ginza as the "Ginza of the World," and one has to admire their high level of propaganda ability.</p>
<p>Nihonbashi, Kyobashi, Ginza, and Shinbashi are a continuous straight street, lined with shops and with heavy traffic. Ginza is in the middle, so it is the most prosperous. Transportation includes cars, streetcars, elevated streetcars, and underground streetcars. It is also close to the banking district and entertainment district of "Marunouchi," and is the only place for the Japanese bourgeoisie to enjoy themselves. Marunouchi is also a newly developed area, full of banks and foreign firms. The Tokyo Takarazuka Theater, the Imperial Theater, and large cinemas are all nearby. Therefore, the staff of banks and foreign firms and the audiences in the theaters all take the opportunity to take a walk in Ginza, so the streets of Ginza are crowded with men and women all day long, and the traffic is heavy and noisy. On the streets beside it, the Japanese people seen are deep, hardworking, and tense. Only the Japanese in Ginza have changed into a different kind of situation, chic, leisurely, and romantic. If you walk as tense as on the streets beside it, you will definitely step on the feet of the people in front.</p>
<p>The Japanese often curse the earthquake and resent the soft soil, which prevents them from building dozens of stories of buildings like the United States, which is much inferior. According to the Japanese soil, only high-rise buildings of several stories can be built. The buildings are far less grand than Shanghai and Hankou in our country. Large companies such as Mitsukoshi, Itoya, and Shirokiya are lined up along the road, with their windows decorated with flowers and brocades, so you can't help but stop and take a look. Inside the companies are full of female staff with red lips and thin eyebrows, greeting you with smiling faces. Several elevators and escalators carry the crowds up and down. If you have free time, you may wish to go to each department and carefully admire it and feast your eyes. After walking around upstairs and downstairs, you still walk out. Outside the door, the female receptionists still bow to you at ninety degrees and thank you. You may as well ignore them and stride away. Many people use large companies as places to take a walk and rest, or invite them to trek to the rooftop or the underground cafeteria for a meal. In the restaurants next to it, it always feels like the dishes are served too slowly. In the cafeterias of large companies, you often have to wait for several tens of minutes to get a meal, or you have to stand next to it and wait for a seat. It is so difficult to eat, but the seats are always full, which is really a contradictory thing. What's more, some people enter large companies without buying anything and rush to the toilet, which is also common, especially for women. There are no public toilets in prosperous places in Japan, so the only way is to provide them to large companies.</p>
<p>In addition to large companies, there are dance halls, cafes, and hotels. Walking inside, in the dim, five-colored electric lights, you can only see men and women sitting side by side and laughing softly. Beer and coffee are poured down their throats cup by cup. Each cafe often has nearly a hundred women prepared to entertain customers. Entering the environment, it is as if you have arrived in a country of daughters. Most dance halls do not sell food and drink, and there are few seats. After dancing, they all stand aside, waiting for the lyrics to start again. Dance tickets range from a few cents to two cents. Many ladies and daughters enter the dance halls to spend the good night. .</p>
<p>Five-colored neon lights adorn the walls along the street. Under the interlacing of various different lights, thousands upon thousands of people are moving below. Ginza is the "Street of Strolls" for the Japanese bourgeoisie. Various hawkers in stalls along the road are waiting for the strollers to patronize them. The street artists standing in the dark corners, with their messy hair, black bow ties, and torn suits, hold a plate of colors. For two cents, you can quickly sketch a portrait standing there. On the road, you can only see young gentlemen in neat suits, holding ladies in various Western dresses. There is very little Japanese dress there, and even if there is, it is high-end silk fabric, which ordinary people cannot dream of. Time gradually shifts, and at the first rays of dawn, all the prosperity disappears. The garbage collectors who come out of the Asakawa slum, carrying bamboo baskets on their backs, come to pick up the waste of the gentlemen and ladies.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Struggling to Look at the Beloved Grandson, Embracing Each Other and Crying, Recalling the Past in a Year of Famine, Sowing Wheat and Inviting Disaster</p>
<p>Zhu said: Eight cents a day, we can always afford to live! Just open the house and let us in. The waiter wanted to use money to stalemate him, but he unexpectedly agreed to give the money. There was no better way to control them, so he scratched his head and smiled bitterly. Zhiqian took out a dollar from his body and stuffed it into the waiter's hand, saying: ! I'll pay this dollar for you. You can't do good things there. You're so hard-hearted! The waiter looked at Zhiqian's expression, sighed, and said: Why bother, let us be difficult. So he walked to the opposite house, pushed open the door of a small room, and said to Sister Hu: Let them go in and cry. I'm going to notify the cashier. Sister Hu also felt that everyone watching in the hallway would hinder the business of the hotel, so she smiled bitterly: You three generations, go and sit in that room, finish your words, and we'll still go home. Lest Mr. Jia comes back and implicates Yueying. After all, she has been living in someone else's house for a long time, don't you think about her, Sister Hu said, thinking very clearly in her heart that this matter was entirely on the old lady, so she helped the old lady and went to the cubicle. Sure enough, everyone followed. Those who were watching the fun saw that people had already entered the house and could not follow them into the house to listen to other people's secrets, so everyone dispersed. In fact, after they were separated, all three generations felt that nothing was explained. When they met again, they couldn't think of anything to say, so they looked at each other in silence.

<h3>The Eighth Day of the National Games: Liaoning Wins the All-Around Championship, Shanghai Ranks Second, Shandong Wins the Women's Softball Championship, Three National Records Set in Men's and Women's Swimming Yesterday, Football Semi-Finals Today, Five Kinds of Ball Game Finals</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth day of the National Games. There are only three days left in the Games. Yesterday, the All-Around Championship ended. The Shanghai team performed poorly and the Liaoning team won the championship, while Shanghai fell to second place. The men's and women's swimming championship situation has already been determined. Guangdong will seize both championships. As a result of yesterday's swimming finals, Chen Zhenxing of the men's team broke the national record for the 100-meter freestyle. The women's competition was full of twists and turns. Yang Xiuqiong was unexpectedly defeated by Liu Guizhen in the 50-meter final, suffering her first defeat. The women's 50-meter and backstroke events both broke the Far East Games record. The competition will continue today. In ball games, Shandong won the women's softball championship. There will be five championship finals today: (1) Women's Basketball, (2) Men's Volleyball, (3) Baseball, (4) Men's Doubles Tennis, (5) Women's Doubles Tennis. Today's football semi-finals, Malaya vs. Hong Kong, Guangdong vs. Shanghai, will be particularly sensational.</p>

<h3>Defeating Yang Xiuqiong, Liu Guizhen Becomes an Overnight Sensation</h3>
<p>Unexpected Result in Women's 50-Meter Final, Breaking National and Far East Games Records with 36.2 Seconds, Mermaid Suffers First Defeat and Ranks Second</p>
<p>Yesterday's swimming changes, the women's group two finals, 50-meter freestyle and 100-meter backstroke, were all beyond general expectations, creating extremely excellent results. Yang Xiuqiong, who swam across the swimming pool without ever encountering an opponent, was unexpectedly defeated by Miss Liu Guizhen of Guangdong in yesterday's 50-meter final, with a very slight difference. The competition was extremely fierce in the middle. Yang Xiuqiong had a superior result of 36 seconds in the semi-finals, so the audience's attention was focused on the mermaid, with heads moving and thunderous applause. Before the race, photographers rushed to photograph her, assuming that the championship would be no problem. Unexpectedly, as soon as the gun fired, Liu Guizhen of Guangdong took the lead, and Yang Xiuqiong never surpassed left and right, reaching the finish line in 36 seconds. Yang Xiuqiong was only a hand away, ranking second.</p>
<p>Breaking the Record and Defeating the Mermaid</p>
<p>The women's 50-meter freestyle final was held on the court, and the atmosphere was white-hot, reaching its peak. At the sound of the gun, shouts rose everywhere, but seeing the splashing water, the mermaid Xiuqiong was ranked third. Guangdong's Liu Guizhen took the lead first. When she swept past the 25-meter dividing line, the mermaid was still about three feet behind. The audience's energy was even more enthusiastic, especially the Guangdong athletes, who danced with their hands and feet. On the one hand, those who cheered for the mermaid were even more numerous. The mermaid splashed and rushed like an arrow leaving the string, gradually catching up, but Liu was only a few inches away. In the last five meters, the struggle was even more fierce, and Liu finally took the lead with a slight difference. The result was 36.2 seconds, breaking Xiuqiong's Far East record of 36.93 seconds and the national record of 38.2 seconds, but still not as good as Xiuqiong's 36 seconds in the semi-finals. The others were very close, and Zhi Yuhui and Xun Ying unfortunately failed to be selected. This Guangdong entry of four people won a total of fourteen points, while Hong Kong only got eight points.</p>
<p>Liu Guizhen Smiles</p>
<p>When Liu Guizhen came out of the water, the cheers of the Guangdong team shook the audience, and photographers surrounded her, impenetrable. There were those who took pictures and those who expressed concern and comfort. The lady's attitude was quiet, smiling frequently, and she must have had unspeakable joy in her heart.</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong Has a Different Taste</p>
<p>After the 50-meter race, Miss Yang ranked second. After coming out of the water, no one asked her about it. Her pink face contained a halo, and her eyes seemed unable to bear the sadness. She lowered her head in disappointment and went to rest, sobbing softly. Since the lady has enjoyed fame, this is the first time she has been defeated, and she has a different taste in her heart.</p>
<p>Results of the Women's 50-Meter Freestyle Final</p>

<h3>Guo Zhenheng Maintains the Breaststroke Throne</h3>
<p>Final Result 3 Minutes 9.5 Seconds Record Is Average Due to Lack of Competition In the men's 200-meter breaststroke final, after the start, the frog king Guo was careful and cautious. After one lap, it was just floating waves, and there was no outstanding performance. No such Guangdong general Wang Yaomin, with great ambition, intended to gently grab the throne of the frog king, closely following, and refused to let go half a step. At the second lap, he was almost overtaken. Seeing the great enemy in front of him, Xiao Guo did not allow himself to be negligent, so he changed his light and casual style to a tense pace of bold strokes. Sure enough, in the third lap, the frog king had broken away from the enemy's pursuit and was walking in the tranquil front line of the mist. Wang Yaomin followed step by step, struggling to catch up, but in the end, his strength was higher and lower than that of Guo, and he was thrown off by five feet. General Lao Jicheng of Malaysia and the main force of Shanghai, Jian Erjie, both abandoned their efforts due to various reasons, knowing that the competition lacked, and failed to update the national record. Filipino Huang Eryi is indeed a rare talent, and the Min general Lin Huitian and the Gui general Liu Kun actually defeated the Ma Hua He Shidong and Chen Fuxing of Hong Kong yesterday, which is also great.</p>
<p>First Place Guo Zhenheng (Guangdong) 3 Minutes 9.5 Seconds</p>

<h3>Men's 100-Meter Freestyle Final Chen Zhenxing Breaks National Record</h3>
<p>1 Minute 5.7 Seconds Chen Qisong Second</p>
<p>Chen Zhenxing broke the national record for the men's 100-meter freestyle, 1 minute 5.7 seconds, which was the most colorful of the men's yesterday. The strength of each person is average. Within 50 feet, they still move forward shoulder to shoulder, with no order. Chen Zhenxing turned quickly, taking the lead. Chen Qisong tried his best to compete at 60 feet, almost surpassing. Chen relied on his good sprint and won Chen with one arm. The result was 1 minute 5.7 seconds, breaking Qisong's national record of 1 minute 6.6 seconds. Li Luomin lived up to expectations and indeed struggled to win third place. Zhu Xiushan followed closely, and Liang Weisheng was listed fifth by a narrow margin. Min Pan William was named the last.</p>

<h3>Men's 400-Meter Freestyle Preliminary Yang Weimo Breaks Record</h3>
<p>5 Minutes 49.2 Seconds No Problem for the Final Championship</p>
<p>The men's 400-meter freestyle preliminary, a total of six groups were held, the best result was Ma Hua Yang Weiying's 5 minutes 49.3 seconds, breaking the national record. Shanghai's Shi Bogen's 6 minutes 1.9 seconds, and Min Chen Shulin's 6 minutes 2.1 seconds, were also slightly satisfactory. Each led a group, and the rest of the results were average. Hong Kong's Chen Zhennan is a long-distance athlete, but he did not show his skills yesterday, and it is said that he is waiting. What is most laughable is that in the first group competition, only Guangdong's Mai Weiming and Su Wang Houzhang participated. Wang Chengling went very far from Mai, and it took more than ten minutes to reach the end point. After Mai finished swimming, Wang had not yet reached 300 meters, but because the two participated, they were also ranked second. In the first group, there were four people, only Guangdong's Mai Weiming and Su Wang Houzhang. When looking at the time, Mai was 6 minutes 13.3 seconds, and Wang was 10 minutes 47 seconds. In the second group, there were still two people who abandoned the competition. Guangdong's Shi Jinping was originally a famous long-distance general and had indeed skilled at it. Beijing's Peng Zonggui was also not weak, and the competition was very fierce. In the last lap, they were still shoulder to shoulder. Shi relied on the final sprint to win first place, and Peng fell behind by nine feet. In the third group, Shi Bogen showed his skills, leading all the way, and no one could match him. Only Gui Lei Bingchang was able to closely follow him, and was only ten feet away from Shi at the finish line, which was indeed valuable. Although Ping Tao's Yongzhong swimming method was not very good, he was able to work hard to reach the end, which won the sympathy of the audience. In the fifth group, Ma Hua Yang Weimo, a master in this field, took the lead and led the group. Gui Huang Jinghuan was unwilling to show weakness and closely followed. At 100 meters, they were already side by side. Afterwards, the two always did not leave, and in the last lap, Yang worked hard to sprint, like an arrow leaving the string, leading by more than fourteen meters, and won the first place, 5 minutes and 49 seconds, breaking Shi Xing's national record. Ji Yang was still the last in breaststroke, more than three laps away from Yang. In the fifth group, Min Chen Shulin defeated Hong Kong's Chen Fuxing with an excellent result of 6 minutes 2.1 seconds, which can be called a cold door. Chen's whole process was average, and he lacked sprinting. The small general Ding Zhaohua of Zhejiang was unfortunately not selected by a difference of ten feet, which was very regrettable. In the sixth group, only Min Hong Anxun and Hong Kong Chen Zhennan participated, and the rest abandoned the competition. In the middle, neither was ahead nor behind. In the final sprint, the speed was good. At the end, Hong defeated Zhennan by the lead of one arm, which can be said to be commendable. The results are as follows,</p>
<p>Set a New National Record for the 400-Meter Freestyle Swim Yang Weimo</p>
<h3>Men's and Women's Swimming Two Flags, Steadily Fell into the Hands of Guangdong, Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong Won First Place in the Men's and Women's Overall Scores</h3>
<p>The situation of the swimming championship is now settled. Guangdong men and women are the heroes and will seize the two championships to go. There are many and average talents. Hong Kong's women's championship will give way this year. The Yang sisters are isolated and cannot match. However, the individual overall score, the men will still be Chen Zhenxing Yang Xiuqiong without problems.</p>
<h3>Yang Hsiu-chiong Wins 100-Meter Backstroke Championship, Beating Liang Yongxian by Three Meters</h3>
<p>1 Minute 37.4 Seconds Also Breaks Far East Games Record – A Consolation After 50-Meter Failure</p>
<p>After Yang Hsiu-chiong was unexpectedly defeated in the 50-meter final, she also faced a strong opponent, Liang Yongxian from Guangdong, in the 100-meter backstroke final. Many people were concerned for her because Liang's performance in the preliminary round was better than Yang Hsiu-chiong's. The atmosphere was extremely tense. Hsiu-chiong, to maintain her reputation, concentrated all her strength and made a desperate effort. She indeed defeated Liang Yongxian, achieving an unexpected excellent result of 1 minute 37.4 seconds. Although Liang Yongxian lost, her performance was also quite remarkable.</p>
<p>The Last 30 Meters</p>
<p>At the sound of the starting gun, eight mermaids darted forward. Liang took the lead in the first leg, but Hsiu-chiong overtook her at 70 meters, finishing about three meters ahead. Her time was 1 minute 37.4 seconds, breaking her own Far Eastern record of 38 seconds. Compared to Liang's 1 minute 41.1 seconds and her own 1 minute 43.2 seconds in the preliminary round, her time far exceeded them. No wonder she was surrounded by dozens of cameras when she left the water after the swim. Miss Gui Yongfang managed to win third place, and even surpassed Hsiu-chen, which was commendable.</p>
<p>Miss Liang Also Cries</p>
<p>Liang Yongxian was still in the lead at 70 meters. At this point, only Yang Hsiu-chiong could be seen floating on the water, gritting her teeth, closing her eyes, and struggling hard. Her speed suddenly increased, and her late burst of strength was the main reason for her victory. Liang's physical condition was not as good, leading to her defeat. After getting out of the water, Miss Liang couldn't help but feel sad, and tears streamed down her face. Her ambition is commendable, and Miss Liang will surely have her day. When she returned to the rest room, she was still seen raising her arm to wipe away tears. The final results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yang Hsiu-chiong (Hong Kong) 1 minute 37.4 seconds (Breaks National and Far East Games Record)</p>
<p>(2) Liang Yongxian (Guangdong) 1 minute 42.8 seconds (Breaks National Record)</p>
<p>(3) Liu Guizhen (Guangdong)</p>
<p>(4) Pang Yongfang (Guangxi)</p>
<p>(5) Yang Xiuzhen (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>(6) Chen Fengqing (Hong Kong)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong, Malaysia, Shanghai, Guangdong: Soccer's Four Giants in Semifinals Today, Starting at 1:00 PM at the Athletics Field; Shanghai and Guangdong to Compete in Three Finals Today</h3>
<p>The Games will conclude the day after tomorrow. The team competitions will all be resolved today and tomorrow, with each team vying for the championship. The competition is especially intense, and spectators will be overwhelmed. Today's program includes five finals: women's basketball, men's and women's tennis doubles, men's volleyball, and men's baseball. The soccer matches, which are most popular in Shanghai, will feature the four giants: Hong Kong, Malaysia, Shanghai, and Guangdong, competing in the semifinals today. Shanghai will play Guangdong, and Hong Kong will play Malaysia. All four teams are evenly matched, so there is no real distinction between semifinals and finals. Men's basketball is also an exciting event. In addition, the women's volleyball semifinals will surely be spectacular.</p>
<p>Soccer Semifinals: Hong Kong, Malaysia, Shanghai, Guangdong</p>
<p>The four soccer giants, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Shanghai, and Guangdong, are scheduled to play in the semifinals today. Their strength and talent are well-known. Today, Hong Kong will play Malaysia, and Shanghai will play Guangdong, starting at 1:00 PM at the athletics field. Their evenly matched strength and the rare opportunity to meet will be a grand event. Because it is the semi-final, final, third-fourth place match, and second-third place match, the four teams will have the opportunity to meet each other. The continual performances will make fans lose sleep and forget to eat. The team lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Lineup</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Yu Qingyuan, Liang Xianzhan, Li Guowei, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Zhuo Shijin, Li Huitang, Li Zhaorong, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Malaysia Lineup</p>
<p>Huang Jinbo, Zhen Anlin, Lin Xifu, Cai Wenli, Jian Dehui, Du Zhiquan, Du Yachi, Guan Xinde, Xie Qingfu, Yao Shenghua, Yin Jinzhen</p>
<p>Guangdong Lineup</p>
<p>Xiao Dianlian, Mai Shaohan, He Zuoxian, Liu Qingcai, Xu Yahui, Li Guozhao, Chen Zhenhe, Ou Bingming, Huang Yongkang, Tan Jiangbai, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Shanghai Lineup</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Li Ning, Jiang Shanjing, Gu Shangqin, Feng Yunyou, Liang Shutang, Wan Xianghua, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Men's and Women's Tennis Doubles Finals</p>
<p>The tennis matches today are all doubles finals. The Shanghai-Malaysia semifinals at 9:00 AM will surely be fierce. Since the two Malaysian singles players lost to Shanghai, they will surely seek revenge in the doubles match and hope to win the championship. Lin Wangsu and Ruan Guoying cooperate perfectly. Ruan Guoying's doubles performance is even better than Lin Wangsu's, so their strength can be imagined. Shanghai wants to win this year's championship. The Lin-Qiu team will not easily let go in the face of such a strong enemy. The winner of this group will play Java in the finals this afternoon to determine the doubles championship. At the same time, the loser of the Shanghai-Malaysia semifinal will play Sichuan's Wang Wenzheng and Qian Yaobin for third and fourth place. In the women's doubles, Shanxi and Sichuan will compete in the final, with the Wang sisters having a strong chance of winning. Shanghai and Malaysia will compete for third and fourth place.</p>
<p>Women's Basketball Shanghai vs. Guangdong Final</p>
<p>Shanghai won the championship last year. This year, they see the championship as something already in their possession. They have had smooth sailing through the preliminary, second, and semi-final rounds. They consider Fujian to be their only strong opponent, but Fujian's skills are not as good as in the previous year. In yesterday's semifinal, they were defeated by Guangdong. Today, Shanghai and Guangdong will compete for glory. Guangdong's skills are also well-known. The final will surely be intense. The semi-final losers, Jiangsu and Fujian, will compete for third and fourth place. The winner will then compete with the loser of the Shanghai-Guangdong final for second and third place. The men's basketball matches are the semifinals: Hebei vs. Beiping, and Shanghai vs. Beijing. The competition will be fierce.</p>
<p>Women's Basketball Shanghai vs. Guangdong Final</p>
<p>The men's volleyball teams have advanced from the preliminary and second rounds to the semi-finals, and today will be the semi-finals. The Shanghai and Guangdong teams will face off. One is the championship team from last year, and the other is the leader of the volleyball warriors from the South. The meeting of these two powers will naturally be difficult to separate. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of the war. However, judging from the battles of the past few days, Shanghai has a greater attacking power, but the rear line coordination is somewhat lacking. Guangdong's blocking is not active, which is their biggest disadvantage. If the two teams can make up for their shortcomings in the final, then the winner will depend on the degree of their improvement. In the third and fourth place match, Hong Kong will face Malaysia, and Hong Kong will be relatively tough. The second and third place match will depend on the line-ups after the championship is decided. There are two women's volleyball semifinals today. Hunan will play Guangdong, and Hunan will definitely suffer. Shanghai will play Beiping and the match can be quickly resolved with a straight three. In the championship match on the 19th, although the Shanghai leader hopes to retain the title, they should be wary of Guangdong's several balls and prevent it from failing. In the third and fourth place semi-final, Beiping will be eliminated. The second and third place final will depend on the line-ups of the teams that are not selected for the championship.</p>
<p>Men's Baseball: Shanghai and Guangdong Compete for Power</p>
<p>It was expected that Shanghai and Guangdong would win the right to compete in the baseball final. Although the Shanghai team was newly established this year, they are well-trained and have outstanding personnel. They are determined to win the championship. The Guangdong team has a long history and is composed of average personnels, but their strength is not bad. In this year's championship game, it is unknown who will emerge as the winner.</p>

<h3>Liu Changchun's Effort in 400-Meter Relay Secures All-Around Championship for Liaoning; Shanghai Only Third, Losing Throne; Zhang Lingjia's Performance in Decathlon Mediocre</h3>
<p>The all-around competition concluded yesterday. The remaining events of the decathlon and the 400-meter relay final were held as scheduled. The final results show that Liaoning won the all-around championship with 19 points, Shanghai came in second with 17 points, Guangdong came in third with 16 points, and Beiping came in fourth with 15 points. Liaoning's victory in the all-around championship was unexpected. Their ability to beat Shanghai in the 1600-meter relay was not easy. Hao Chunde's disqualification from the competition was also a major reason for Shanghai's loss of the all-around championship. The 400-meter relay final yesterday was quite intense. The Beiping team won the first place. The results of the second half of the decathlon showed that Zhang Lingjia still took the lead, but his performance was mediocre, far less than his performance in the previous Games.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lingjia Retains Decathlon Championship, But Score of Only 4989 Points Is Unsatisfactory</h3>
<p>The decathlon's second half was held yesterday. The participants included Zhang Lingjia, Zhou Changxing, Cheng Mengping, Wu Jinqi, Liang Zhichu, Wang Shilin, Xia Shufu, Chen Yijing, Wei Zhiping, Huang Bogang, Wu Guangtai, and Liu Mengling, a total of twelve people. The high hurdles and discus were held in the morning, and the javelin, pole vault, and 1500 meters were held in the afternoon. As a result, Zhang Lingjia led the group with 4989 points and won the championship. Zhang is a veteran athlete in our country. Since 1920, he has been the leader in the national decathlon. However, Zhang's results in the past two days have not exceeded his own past records. The results of other athletes were even more mediocre. Among the decathlon competitions, Zhang Lingjia's discus throw of 35.96 meters was relatively impressive, but none of the others are worth mentioning. The results of the second half are recorded below. The first half was recorded in this newspaper previously.</p>
<h3>Beiping Team Wins 400-Meter Relay – Time of 46.5 Seconds – Liu Changchun of Liaoning Pulls Through Three Barriers</h3>
<p>The 400-meter relay final yesterday included teams from Beiping, Guangdong, Shanghai, Nanjing, Liaoning, Hebei, Suiyuan, and Qingdao. At the start, Guangdong took the lead, followed by Beiping, and Shanghai was in third place. In the second leg, the Shanghai, Beiping, and Guangdong teams were running side by side, making it difficult to distinguish. In the third leg, Beiping overtook Guangdong. In the fourth leg, Beiping was first, Guangdong was second, and Shanghai was third. Liaoning was in eighth place. The fourth leg runner for Liaoning was Liu Changchun. After receiving the baton, Liu Changchun struggled to catch up, first catching up with Suiyuan, then Qingdao, and soon catching up with Hebei's Han Jinglin, thus taking fifth place. Liaoning's success in the 400-meter relay was entirely due to Liu Changchun. Liaoning's victory in the all-around championship was due to Liu Changchun's special efforts in the two relay races. As a result, the Beiping team won the championship with a time of 46.5 seconds, which was not as good as Shanghai's 46 seconds and Guangdong's 46.3 seconds in the preliminary round. The list of winning team members is recorded below.</p>

<h3>Women's Softball: Shandong Wins Women's Softball Championship; Defeats Hebei 10-6 in Yesterday's Final; Defending Champion Shanghai Retreats to Fourth Place</h3>
<p>The women's softball championship included six teams: Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hebei, Nanjing, Shandong, and Guangdong. Since the start of the competition on the 11th, after many battles, as of yesterday, the defending champion Guangdong had lost its hegemony, and it was owned by the Shandong team. Shanghai was ranked fourth. At 9:00 AM today, Hebei and Guangdong will compete in the second and third place match, which will be the last scene of this year's competition.</p>
<h3>Shandong Wins the Championship: Seven Innings End in a 6-6 Tie, Shandong Adds Four Points in Extra Innings</h3>
<p>Shandong first defeated Nanjing, then Guangdong, and then Hebei, winning three consecutive matches and winning the championship. The entire team's pitching and batting were excellent, the fighting spirit was brave, and the cooperation was wonderful. All three were present, and this honor is well-deserved. Hebei had advantages similar to those of the championship team, but lacked the favor of fortune. After seven innings, the two sides each scored six points, resulting in a tie. In the extra innings, Shandong added four points in one breath, thus defeating Hebei 10-6 and winning the championship. Shandong pitcher Zhang Muxia took over from Jin Zhifan, Hebei pitcher Lu Yunyan took over from Lu Qingyan, umpire Shen Guoquan, base umpire Cui Yalan, and recorder Xia Kaiming.</p>
<p>Four Base Hits Lead to Victory</p>
<p>Shandong's victory came in the eighth inning after a tie in the seventh. Four consecutive hits, plus running and stealing, earned four points, thus deciding the outcome. Comparing the scores of both sides, Shandong had eleven hits and scored ten points, while Hebei had nine hits and scored six points. Shandong was superior to Hebei in stealing bases, with twelve steals compared to the latter's eight.</p>
<p>Formidable Opponents Clash</p>
<p>Shandong batted first. Wang Fengjie's initial attempt was unsuccessful, and Jin Zhifan took over, hitting a single to reach first base. After repeated attempts, he reached third base. When the pitcher fumbled the ball, he rushed back to home plate, scoring the first point for Shandong. Hebei switched to offense, and Huang Xiulian ran and advanced to third base in the blink of an eye. Cui Huixian's single was very helpful, and each side scored one point in the first inning. In the second inning, they defended their boundaries firmly. In the third inning, three Shandong players were thwarted. Hebei's Chen Lanxiang made a surprising home run, scoring one point. Lu Qingyan also had a single, but her teammates were unable to help. In the third inning, Hebei scored one, and Shandong scored zero.</p>
<p>No Winner After Seven Innings</p>
<p>In the fourth inning, Shandong's Zhang Shufang hit a single, and Pang Suzhen hit a home run. Before she could score, she also sent Zhang Muxia back, and two hits scored three points. Hebei continued to hit, but Shandong's Feng Lanying and Pang Suzhen cooperated for a double play, ending their hopes. In the fifth inning, Shandong lost momentum, and Hebei's morale was high. First, Lu Yunyan walked to first base, and then reached third base. Then, her teammate Chen Lanxiang helped with a triple, and Lu returned triumphantly. Lu also reached home due to Shandong's fielding error. In this inning, Shandong scored zero, and Hebei scored two. In the sixth inning, Shandong's Zhang Shufang got a single, but her teammates were unable to help, and her efforts were in vain. Hebei took the field, and Lu Huijin led with a single, reaching first base, stealing two bases, and stopping at third base. Li Wenxiu then hit a single, and Lu returned to home plate, adding one point for Hebei. From this inning, the lines changed. Hebei and Shandong's center fielders and right fielders switched positions. In the seventh inning, Shandong found two hits, and Feng Guanying and Liang Guang returned to home plate one after another. Hebei's Chen Lanxiang hit a single, and Shandong's center fielder made a mistake. Chen took advantage of it and returned. At the end of the seventh inning, each side had six points, with no clear winner.</p>
<p>Extra Innings Determine the Championship</p>
<p>At the end of the seventh inning, the scores were tied, and extra innings were played to determine the winner. Shandong's Zhang Muxia stepped up to the plate, swung her bat, and hit a triple that went over second base. When Hebei's center fielder made a mistake, Zhang happily ran back. Zhang Shufang and Pang Suzhen then hit singles, and secretly stole bases, both successfully. Hou Yuzhen also added a single, and Zhang and Pang did not hesitate to return to base and score. Hou also soon returned. These four base hits quickly earned four points and were the key to the two teams' life and death. Hebei also made a final effort, but was blocked by Shandong and failed to achieve its goal, dejectedly admitting defeat.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Crushes Shanghai: Shanghai Suffers Unprecedented Defeat with a Score of 3-32, Guangdong to Compete with Hebei Today for Second and Third Place</h3>
<p>Guangdong and Shanghai both failed in the semi-finals, and competed for third and fourth place at 9:00 AM yesterday. Shanghai suffered an unprecedented defeat, losing 3-32 and ranking fourth. Guangdong will compete with the defeated Hebei team in the semi-finals at 9:00 AM this morning for second and third place. Yesterday's umpire was Hou Luoxun, base umpire was Gao Zi, and recorder was Xia Kaiming.</p>
<p>Disparity in Strength Leads to Losses in Every Inning</p>
<p>Shanghai pitcher Du Suzhen lacked experience, and panicked when facing a strong opponent. Catcher Qian Kun's contributions balanced out. Other players were unable to cooperate, giving the opponent a great opportunity to attack. For a time, the Guangdong cavalry rampaged through Shanghai's defense. The first inning started well, with two points scored. After that, they frequently lost points, eventually becoming unmanageable. Although they recovered one point in the sixth inning, it was already too late.</p>
<p>Everyone Active, Everyone Contributes</p>
<p>Guangdong's victory over Shanghai can be described as a triumph. All players on the field have earned merit. Shanghai scored two points in the first inning and one point in the sixth inning, for a total of three points. Guangdong scored five points in the first inning, three points in the second inning, and as many as fourteen points in the third inning, four points in the fourth inning, one point in the fifth inning, and five points in the sixth inning. The seventh inning was sacrificed. Guangdong pitchers Liang Shiyi and Liang Zhuang'er cooperated well. Liang also hit a home run after her team scored ten points in the third inning, eliciting cheers from the audience.</p>

<h3>Women's Volleyball: Hong Kong and Malaya Eliminated, Shanghai and Guangdong Compete for the Championship, Shanghai Wins 3-0 Against Hong Kong, Guangdong Wins 3-1 Against Malaya</h3>
<p>The semi-finals of the men's volleyball tournament were held in two matches yesterday afternoon: (1) Shanghai vs. Hong Kong, Shanghai won 3-0; (2) Guangdong vs. Malaya, Guangdong won 3-1. From then on, the Shanghai and Guangdong teams jumped over another hurdle. The championship game will be held at 3:00 PM today, and the life and death will be clear.</p>
<p>Shanghai Wins Against Hong Kong</p>
<p>Bad Luck Leads to Hong Kong's Loss</p>
<p>Shanghai and Hong Kong started at 1:00 PM. Umpire Qiu Jixiang gave the order. The Hong Kong team had players like Li Wolin and Lu Baining, and their serves were really powerful. The Shanghai team had bad luck, facing the scorching sun, which caused them to miss the opponent's ball. Therefore, they lost three points at the start. Shanghai's Chen Bocai's serve was also average. Shanghai was the championship team last year, and had many veteran players. This game was their first setback. Not only was there no hope of winning the championship, but also years of hard work would be hurt. Therefore, the central players, such as Cao Qianzan and Qiu Guangqing, all showed their skills and worked hard to counterattack. Sure enough, they succeeded, and chased from 7-8 to 11-8. After changing courts, they had smooth sailing, winning 21-13 and giving Hong Kong a taste of their power.</p>
<p>Loose Middle Row, Listless</p>
<p>In the second inning, Hong Kong's Peng Bunong served. The front and rear guards doubled their efforts, as their life and death depended on it. However, their score was not high. Middle row player Li Zhen'an made a mistake, and when a high ball pressed down, he failed to save it, leading to a lack of enthusiasm. In the first half, Shanghai was still in the lead at 7-11. After changing formations, Shanghai's front row was very active, while Hong Kong wanted to win with hard work. Therefore, they could not withstand Shanghai's closed-door defense. Although Hong Kong's balls came like a storm, most of them were turned away by the strict gate. They lost ground and lacked energy, and victory still went to Shanghai. Hong Kong lost another game, with the score being Hong Kong 12 and Shanghai 21.</p>
<p>Irresistible Force, Hong Kong Eliminated</p>
<p>In the third inning, Hong Kong was at a loss. They could only see General Fei, Qiu Guang (?), jumping and waving his fists like rain, his aura arrogant. Hong Kong really had no way to deal with it. Shanghai's Wei Dingyi even helped the wicked, performing like a god. Hong Kong was surrounded by enemies, at the mercy of the strong neighbor, with no room to resist. Although Li Wolin responded in the middle, his voice was hoarse and exhausted. His solo performance was difficult to win applause. Shanghai eliminated them again in this game with a score of 13-21. The overall result was 3-0, and Shanghai got the right to the finals.</p>
<p>(2) Guangdong Wins Against Malaya</p>
<p>The Fierceness of the Attacks is Like a Melee</p>
<p>The volleyball semi-final between Guangdong and Malaya started after the Shanghai-Hong Kong match, starting at 3:00 PM. The strength of the Guangdong and Malaya teams was balanced. Malaya had worked hard yesterday, so they had a good performance. As soon as the battle started, the athletes had the ambition to win. The fierceness of the attacks was like a melee. The first half was the same, and the situation was balanced. The tense situation appeared in the second half. The sound of continuous artillery fire was frightening. Malaya's back row Zheng Xinmin, middle row Huang Xiuren, and front row Lin Tianci also had no way to use their skills. They lost with a score of 17-21.</p>
<p>Flying, Dancing, and Falling, Each Not Giving Way</p>
<p>Malaya came from afar with a long-trained army. They had not encountered a strong team in previous battles. In the semi-final, they met a strong general for the first time, so they were naturally frightened. The second game was worse than the first, because the situation was serious. The game was even more exciting. The stands were filled with ball brothers and ball sisters, flirting, all cheering. For a time, the warriors in the two regions flew, danced, and fell, which was very interesting. All the players were from Guangdong, but they played for their respective teams and did not give in. Even a point lost was very petty, and they had to get it back. When there were five minutes left, Malaya actually won back a game with a score of 19-21.</p>
<p>Too Much Lost Ground, No Way to Recover</p>
<p>After a short break, everyone discussed how to deal with the situation. After the game was over, another bloody battle began. Guangdong general Hu Yingcai won two points for serving. Malaya returned the favor. You came and I went, and the soldiers met. The audience was dizzy and could hardly tell who was who. In the midst of the chaotic situation, the referee announced the change of courts. Malaya only had nine points at the time. At that time, they turned the horse's head, rushing left and right, but there was no way out. When Malaya's Liang Ju served, he benefited greatly from the opportunity. However, because of too much lost ground, the chronic disease could not be cured. The score was 14-21, and Guangdong took the lead again.</p>
<p>Trapped in a Horse Pit, No Way to Escape</p>
<p>In the fourth game, Malaya believed that the key to life and death was in this game, so they did not dare to treat it carelessly. However, the newborn calf was not accustomed to heavy pressure. Guangdong's military appearance was refreshed for a time. The starting kill was not worth the price. Almost all of Malaya's troops were trapped in a horse pit. If they wanted to turn around, it was impossible, let alone make any progress. Therefore, the first half was only 11-5. After the change of courts, it was Guangdong's Huang Yingjie's turn to serve. He connected two consecutive times, and Malaya sat back and watched the defeat. He scored as many as eight points in a row. Finally, Mei Dixian used a fresh and crisp method to get the back row pass and kill it to complete the great cause. The score of this game was 21-19, and Guangdong won a great victory.</p>

<h3>Men's Tennis: Singles Semi-finals: Lin Baohua Loses to Xu Chengji</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai Defeats Qian Yaobin, Xu and Qiu to Compete for the Championship Tomorrow</p>
<p>The two groups of the men's singles semi-finals started at 1:00 PM yesterday. Xu Chengji vs. Lin Baohua, a fierce battle of four sets, ended in victory. As a result, Xu controlled the overall situation with his cannonball serve and urgent shots, and the performance was the most exciting since the start of the competition. Lin, on the other hand, borrowed from the city and worked hard, although he won the third set, he finally bowed down due to his slightly biased skills. Qiu Feihai vs. Qian Yaobin, a pair of bull skin candies, with few exciting moments, a bloody battle of four sets, Qiu finally won the right to the final. Xu and Qiu will compete for the top spot tomorrow, and Lin and Qian will also hold a third and fourth place final at the same time. Xu's final, Xu can steadily win the championship, Lin's victory over Qian is also undoubted, so Lin and Qiu will have a brotherly battle the day after tomorrow to determine the second and third place.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Wins Against Lin Baohua</p>
<p>Since the opening of the competition, Xu Chengji has been invincible and invincible. He defeated Xu Liaopei and then Wang Wenzheng, and never lost a set. His momentum is unparalleled. His cannonball serve, his thunderous overhead high pressure, and his extremely rapid forehand and backhand shots are all superior. Moreover, his counterattack is urgent, and the landing point is excellent. Not only is he highly skilled, but he is also knowledgeable and experienced. It is appropriate to win a hundred battles and a hundred victories. Lin Baohua has gained weight in recent years, is not good at running, and cannot last for a long time. He met Lin Chongsu the other day, and fought fiercely for three hours before winning the right to the semi-finals, but he was already exhausted and his vitality was greatly damaged. Although Lin did not hesitate to run and desperately parry yesterday, Xu took it with wisdom, attacked from the east and west, sometimes far and sometimes near, and the ball came out uncertainly, making it difficult to grasp. Lin finally surrendered because he was tired of running. Lin sometimes used a near ball to embarrass the enemy, but Xu rescued him properly, and instead made a fool of himself. Looking at the overall situation, it was all Xu's world. Lin won a set, which was not easy.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle Begins</p>
<p>Lin served first, and returned victoriously, and then led with a score of 2-1, which was a good omen. He hoped to have a smooth journey and directly attack Huanglong, but things went against his wishes. Xu used his serve to tie the score, and then high-pressure shots, frequently applying pressure. Lin simply parried and defended with difficulty. After Xu won Lin's serve, he went all the way and rose three levels in a row, winning the first set 6-2. Starting from the second set, Xu used the remaining prestige of his victory, and the light was shining. The bottom line was long shots, deep into the two corners, or directly along the side, making Lin unable to save. Lin repeatedly used high balls to embarrass the enemy, but he made a fool of himself and was counterattacked by Xu's overhead (?), hitting the key point, so he lost again. The score was 6-3, Xu won 2-0 (sets).</p>
<p>High Advantage</p>
<p>The third set started. Lin, in view of the disastrous defeat in the first two sets, broke the boat and vowed to avenge. He also changed his strategy and used his masterpiece of chopping the ball to control the enemy. Although Xu was strong, he was at a loss. After Xu won by serving, Lin won four games in a row. At this time, Lin's momentum was strong, and the limelight turned, and it was Lin's golden age. In the next game, Xu went online to block and kill, and used his interception skills to win back a game. After that, he frequently used two-line bottom corner shots to attack Lin. However, Lin ran around the field,</p>
<p>Disregarding One's Own Safety</p>
<p>He tried his best to cope with it and saved a lot of dangerous balls. Xu thought that it was better not to pursue the poor bandits, and did not demand too much, so Lin won a set with a score of 6-2. After a short break, the battle started again. Lin was inevitably tired after the fierce battle, but Xu was relaxed and calm. Xu took one game first with four serves, and then broke Lin's serve with two corner shots, and was ahead with a score of 2-0. Lin launched a counterattack, and again used the old trick of chopping the ball to win back a game. Xu saw through the plot, went online to intercept, and returned it twice, occupying</p>
<p>Absolute Advantage</p>
<p>Lin saw Xu winning online, so he sent a high ball again. At that time, the sunlight was dazzling, and Xu's high pressure failed to succeed. Lin chased to 4-2. Xu immediately returned the color and added a game, making it 5-2. The next game has entered the melee period. Lin was already 40-30 ahead, but a wild ball caused a tie. Then, although he went online to block and kill, he was fiercely pulled by Xu and flew straight to the bottom corner. Lin was unable to recover and was helpless. The whole game ended 2-6.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Wins Against Qian Yaobin</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai is a veteran on the sand court, with rich experience, but unfortunately his physical strength is weak, and his shots are weak. Even his best bottom line long shots are not enough to kill the enemy. Yesterday he fought Sichuan's Qian Yaobin. Since Qian defeated Javanese Zeng Duancai and won the right to the semi-finals, his momentum was loud and the younger generation was awesome. Although he lost yesterday, he was calm in the face of battle and acted boldly, giving Lao Qiu a great threat, and the score was always close, so although he lost, he was still glorious.</p>
<p>Qiu served to win, and Qian returned the same way. Since then, you one game and I one game, each not giving way, the score advanced side by side, until at 5-5 each, Qiu still got the serve, and Qian suddenly lost control, and the wild ball repeatedly, ruined the overall situation, 7-5 Lao Qiu</p>
<p>First Victory</p>
<p>In the second set, Qian was unwilling to be dominated, and resisted with courage. His forehand shots made great contributions, leading with a score of 3-0. Lao Qiu was old and tired, and it was difficult to run. He struggled to cope with it and saved a game. Qian continued his efforts and created a 5-1 winning situation. Although Qiu won another game, the general trend was gone and could not be recovered. He was beaten by Qian with a score of 6-2</p>
<p>Create a Balanced Situation</p>
<p>In the third set, Xiao Qian worked very hard, and Lao Qiu followed closely, never leaving his footsteps. However, because Qian was eager to win, he made more wild balls, which was taken advantage of by Qiu, and added two games in a row. Qian won back a game. The next game was related to the victory or defeat of this set. The competition between the two sides was fierce. After seven ties, Qiu finally won the victory and won the third set, with a score of 6-3. In the fourth set, Qian tried his best to resist and wanted to save the crazy tide from falling, but in the most critical moment, he was always too hasty,</p>
<p>Lost a Good Opportunity</p>
<p>Lao Qiu had the victory in his hands, and his stamina was very strong. Three yuan in a row gave Xiao Qian a fatal injury. Qian's spirit was dissipated, and his fighting spirit was gone. Although he reluctantly chased up a few games, he was always inferior to others all the way with a score of 4-2, 5-3. Finally, Lao Qiu won the right to the final with a score of 6-3 again.</p>

<h3>Doubles Semi-finals: Java Eliminates Sichuan, Shanghai and Malaya to Play a Supplementary Game This Morning, The Winner Will Compete With Java in the Finals This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The men's tennis doubles, Shanghai vs. Malaya was originally scheduled to be held on the 16th. Because the singles game was over, everyone was exhausted, and the sky was getting late, both parties agreed to change it to 9:00 AM today. Shanghai will still be represented by Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, while Malaya will be represented by Lin Wangsu and Ruan Guoying. These two groups are strong and have the possibility of winning the championship. There will be the most exciting and fierce competition at that time.</p>
<p>The battle between Java and Sichuan was a three-set match the other day and was not completed. Sichuan was in the lead with a score of 2-1. It was changed to be continued at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Wang Wenzheng and Qian Yaobin had great ambitions and planned to make a splash and defeat the two Xus of Java. But things went against their wishes, all because their skills were inferior. Starting from the fourth set, the two Xus went all the way smoothly, and with their rapid shots and heavy high pressure, they made Wang Qian at a loss. After losing five games in a row, although they quickly chased up and won back three games, they finally lost to the two Xus with a score of 6-3. In the final game, Sichuan still did not improve, and Java won again with a score of 6-2, and won the final (?). The five-set scores are as follows.</p>

<h3>Women's Tennis: Wang Chunjing and Wei Maigu Win the Right to the Singles Finals, Huang Shannong and Chen Qing Suffer a Complete Defeat</h3>
<p>The two groups of the women's tennis singles semi-finals started at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Shanxi Wang Chunjing vs. Nanjing Huang Shannong, Shanghai Wei Maigu vs. Nanjing Chen Qing, the situation was one-sided. Especially the battle between Jin and Jing was even more miserable. As a result, Jin Wang and Hu Wei won the right to the finals.</p>
<p>Jin Wang Chunjing</p>
<p>She has been going smoothly in this competition, and has not encountered any opponents. She has not lost a set so far. Jing Huang Shannong's skills are still good, but she panicked when facing a strong enemy. After a tie in the first set, Wang won two games in a row. After Huang chased up a game, she fell into a slump and lost the first set with a score of 6-2. Huang was even worse in the second set, and there was no way to fight back. Even the parry was often stretched. At the end of the whole game, she only won four points, winning one game with two points, one game with two points, and only three games. It opened a new record in this competition, which is also an interesting thing.</p>

<p>Hu Wei Maigu</p>
<p>Her shooting method is stable, and she defeated Shanxi Xiao Wang before, which was by no means accidental. Chen Qing is a capital player, and her skills are also respectable. Unfortunately, her physical strength is poor and she cannot last long. In the first set, Wei took the offensive, and won the victory and succeeded. Chen only supported and had no way to fight back. Then, although she cheered up and won back a few games, she finally lost the first set with a score of 3-6 first. Chen felt even more unable to support in the first set. Wei was able to control freely and was even more aggressive. Chen only won one game and lost again with a score of 1-6. Wei won the right to the final.</p>

<p>The four teams of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Fujian, who won the right to the women's basketball semi-finals, held their respective semi-finals starting at 2:00 PM yesterday. In the first game, Shanghai met Jiangsu. As a result, Jiangsu was not Shanghai's opponent at all, and was defeated 4-58. The second game was Guangdong vs. Fujian. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and the scores rose and fell. The Fujian team members were short, which was a big disadvantage. As a result, Shanghai scored several goals in a row in the last five minutes, and lost the right to the finals with a score of 34-40. The two teams of Shanghai and Guangdong, who won the right to the finals, are scheduled to compete in the finals at 4:00 PM today. According to the results of previous competitions in this competition, Shanghai has an 80% chance of winning the championship. The two teams of Jiangsu and Fujian, who were eliminated in the semi-finals, are scheduled to compete for the third and fourth place at 10:00 AM today. It is not a problem for Fujian to win against Jiangsu. If Guangdong is defeated by Shanghai, then Fujian and Guangdong will have to fight once to determine the runner-up. The results of yesterday's battle are as follows.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Defeats Jiangsu; Jiangsu Avoids Being Shut Out</h3>
<p>The women's basketball teams of Shanghai and Jiangsu held a rematch yesterday afternoon at two o'clock. After Jiangsu's victory over Beiping in the first match, their reputation soared. Yesterday, they fought against the extremely sharp Shanghai team. We certainly expected them to lose, but we never imagined they would lose so miserably. Xu Biyun's shooting, usually quite accurate, was out of sorts yesterday. She missed all five free throws. Shanghai even used substitute players at one point, but the Jiangsu team still couldn't reverse the decline. Throughout the game, they were at the mercy of their opponents, helpless. Zhao Lianzhen and Huang Lianzhen scored a valuable four points in the first and second halves, avoiding a shutout. The rest of the points were entirely scored by Shanghai. After forty minutes, the Shanghai players, without even breaking a sweat, easily won with a score of 58 to 4, securing the right to the final.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Team Wins Against Fujian After Hard Fight; Last Five Points Determine Victory</h3>
<p>The match between Guangdong and Fujian was completely different from the Shanghai-Jiangsu game. The atmosphere was tense, filled with the sound of battle, and everyone was excited. It was truly like a clash between equally skilled opponents, as described in novels. The scores fluctuated, and it wasn't until the last three minutes that Guangdong scored several goals, leading 40 to 34. Fujian was eliminated. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Taking the Initiative</p>
<p>At two o'clock, both teams leaped out, greeted by applause from the audience. Referee Shu Hong issued the order to start. After a center jump and some passing, a Guangdong defender committed a foul. Lin Suqing, a Fujian player, made the first free throw. Huang Hui'er, a Guangdong forward, flicked her wrist, and the ball went into the basket. Both sides defended too tightly, committing simultaneous fouls, each gaining one point. Rong Xian then displayed her skills, scoring three consecutive goals, taking a 10-3 lead. The Fujian team quickly called a timeout. Xu Xinxi saw the ball and was delighted, making both free throws. Lin Suqing also made accurate free throws, scoring three points, narrowing the gap to 8-7. Soon, the Guangdong team took advantage again, ending the first quarter with a 12-7 lead, taking the initiative.</p>
<p>Coming from Behind</p>
<p>In the second quarter, the Fujian team's defense was slightly changed, and the arrangement was more organized than before. Lin Suqing and Shi Qin Wang, and Xu, the forward, provided timely support. Rong Xianhong quietly left the court, and the Guangdong team lost its focus. Aunt Rui Ping from Xiamen committed consecutive fouls. Lin, the center, had eyes on the ball, heading straight for the basket, surpassing the score by two points. After much back and forth, it was time for a break. The Fujian team narrowly won the first half with a score of 19-17.</p>

<p>Neck and Neck</p>
<p>After enjoying some lemonade and oranges, ten minutes passed quickly. Huang Hui saw that it was time to shine, breaking through the opponent's basket twice. Xu Xinxi's luck ran out, and she was penalized for fouls and had to leave the court. Wu Xianyu was transferred from defense to forward, greatly affecting the team's strength. Rong Jia Xianhong made a comeback, and the spring gate saw joy. The Fujian team was unwilling to fall behind, and the scores evened out. Applause thundered all around, making the match extremely close. After tying at 25 points each, Dao Mali scored two more goals, and the Fujian team also gained some points, but they were slightly behind with a score of 28-30.</p>
<p>Falling Short</p>
<p>The last quarter was a matter of life and death for both sides, and each team fought with all their might. Wu Xianyu received the ball from the back and lived up to expectations, making the score even again. From then on, one side would gain momentum while the other would lose it. The scores went from 32 each to simultaneous foul calls. Huang Hui'er made one free throw, but Wu, Lianxin, was flustered and missed the basket. The ball was snatched by the opponent. Rong Xianhong reappeared, making both goals. The entire stadium roared. The Fujian team's morale wavered, and their hands didn't respond to their minds. Suddenly, a shot rang out, and the Fujian misses lost color in their faces, ultimately losing by six points and being eliminated.</p>
<p>Overall Evaluation of Skills</p>
<p>The Fujian girls' loss yesterday was not due to inferior technique, but rather to their short stature and lack of physical strength. They were always at a disadvantage in jump balls. The Guangdong team was tall and strong, often using high passes, leaving the Fujian team helpless. When stealing the ball, the Fujian team often flipped over and fell to the ground. They must have fallen countless times yesterday. In terms of cooperation and strategy, Fujian was actually better than Guangdong. Lin Suqing and Xu Xinxi's snatching and shooting were quite unique. On the Guangdong side, Rong Xian was the most outstanding, and Huang Hui'er and Liu Mali were also quite strong. However, the overall team coordination was not yet perfect. It would be difficult for them to win against Shanghai today.</p>
<p>A Mixture of Tears and Laughter</p>
<p>Fujian's women's basketball team has always been well-known. In the previous National Games, they fought all the way to the finals, ultimately losing to the Shanghai team by one point. After the game, the entire team of Yu Chang cried together, inconsolably. Yesterday, they unfortunately lost to Guangdong despite being in a winnable situation. After the game ended, team members Xu Xinxi, Zhao Ayu, Lin Xiutai, and others couldn't help but feel sorrow and cried silently in the basketball room. Even those who didn't shed tears were as still as wooden chickens, as if they had lost something precious, not knowing what to do. The Guangdong team, on the other hand, was jubilant, cheering like thunder. One happy, one sad, in the same venue, in the same game, but the atmosphere was completely different.</p>

<h3>National Martial Arts for Men and Women; Finals of National Martial Arts for Men and Women; Mei Niu Wins Women's Strength Test Championship; Malaysian Chinese Dominate Three Weightlifting Groups</h3>
<p>The national martial arts event on the 17th included strength tests and weightlifting competitions for both men and women in the morning, and fist fighting finals for both men and women in the afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strength Test Competition for Men and Women</p>
<p>The strength tests for both men and women were held in the gymnasium, divided into (1) grip strength test, (2) combined strength test, (3) pinching strength test, (4) straddling strength test, (5) splitting strength test, (6) supporting strength test, (7) pushing strength test, (8) pulling strength test, (9) shooting strength test, (10) extending strength test, (11) lifting strength test, and (12) picking strength test. The martial arts division prepared new strength testing devices. Most of the athletes had not used these new devices in their past training, so the inspectors assigned to each strength testing device provided temporary guidance. However, the results were still excellent. Mei Niu Meng Jianli from the women's group once again won the championship. The top rankings are as follows:</p>

<p>Weightlifting Finals; Malaysian Chinese Dominate</p>
<p>The men's weightlifting finals, excluding the lightweight group which was completed the day before, included the middleweight, light heavyweight, and heavyweight groups, which were all completed yesterday morning. The number of participants was very small. There were originally two people in the heavyweight group, but one withdrew, so there was only one person in this group, Malaysian athlete Huang Sheji. However, he still worked hard and set the highest record in the three groups. The champions of the other two groups were also all dominated by Malaysian athletes. Although athletes from several northern provinces participated in each group, the arm strength of the northern athletes was originally not considered small, but due to the different weightlifting methods, they were inferior. Hai Quanxiang, an athlete from Yu, had a very small difference in the weight he increased during the clean and jerk compared to the Malaysian athlete Huang Sheji. This is because the clean and jerk is more free in terms of method, while other lifts such as the snatch and clean and press are different from our country's stone lifting and have more restrictions, resulting in poorer performance.</p>

The athletes from the Qing and Xiang units were the most outstanding in the women's group, while the athletes from the Ji and Lu units were the most brilliant in the men's group. After the fist fighting finals for both men and women, because Wei Fengde and Wang Zizhang had the same score in the solo weapons final the day before, another competition was held to determine the winner.

<h3>Issues with the Women's 400 Meter Relay: Shanghai Team's Protest Letter with Four Reasons; Also Reports Beijing Athlete Yang Chunfu's Eligibility; Jury to Discuss This Matter This Morning - Beiping Team Hears the Situation is Unfavorable -</h3>
<p>In the women's 400-meter relay final, the Shanghai team ran in the wrong lane, and after a protest from the Guangdong team, based on photos taken by Wang Kai, the organizing committee officially announced the disqualification of the Shanghai team, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Shanghai team finds this decision difficult to accept and has submitted a protest letter to the organizing committee stating four reasons. They also reported Beijing athlete Yang Chunfu for participating in preliminary rounds in two different locations, requesting that his eligibility be revoked. The jury has decided to hold a meeting at 10:30 this morning to discuss the matter. The protest letter is transcribed below: Respected Sirs, Regarding the results of the women's 400-meter relay race on the 15th, our team won first place. Later, the Guangdong delegation protested that our team ran in the wrong lane. The organizing committee submitted this case to the jury for discussion on the evening of the 16th. Our team was preparing a written defense when we suddenly heard the official announcement from the organizing committee, revoking our hard-earned victory. We were extremely shocked. The lane assignments for the women's 400-meter relay, (1) were Malaya, (2) Henan, (3) Qingdao, (4) Jiangsu, (5) Beiping, (6) Shanghai, (7) Guangdong, and (8) Fujian. The results, first Shanghai, second Guangdong, third Malaya, fourth Qingdao, fifth Fujian, and sixth Beiping, were officially announced on the afternoon of the 15th, and prizes were awarded. Now, the Guangdong delegation is using the final photo of the race as the basis for their protest, and the organizing committee rashly revoked our team's hard-earned rights. We must submit a defense, (1) The lane assignments for the women's 400-meter relay were already specified in the official program. According to the photo taken by Wang Kai, our team's athletes were in the fifth lane. However, it is questionable whether the officials checked the positions of each team's athletes at that time. This should be noted and is the first point of our protest. (2) Since the Jiangsu athlete in the fourth lane was absent, this lane should have been left empty. Why did the Beiping team run in the same lane during the relay? This should be noted and is the second point of our protest. (3) According to the photo, both the Beiping and Shanghai athletes ran in the wrong lanes. However, we did not hear any official report from the officials at that time. This should be noted and is the third point of our protest. (4) According to the photo taken by Wang Kai, our team was disqualified because we ran in the wrong lane, which is a valuable record for the organizing committee. However, we have not heard that the Beiping athletes, who also ran in the wrong lane, were officially disqualified. This is unfair in terms of both reason and justice. This should be noted and is the fourth point of our protest. Based on the above points, we find it difficult to accept the organizing committee's disqualification of our team in the women's 400-meter relay race. Furthermore, in the all-around sports 400-meter relay race, Nanjing athlete Yang Chunfu participated in the preliminary round in Jiangsu Second District, originally named Yang Donghai. Now, he is representing Nanjing and has changed his name to Yang Chunfu. We request that the organizing committee thoroughly investigate and disqualify him. Attached is a protest deposit of ten yuan. We hope that you will investigate and reply. Sincerely, Sixth National Games Jury, Shanghai Delegation General Representative Jiang Jianbai, Team Leader Shao Rugan. It is heard that the general opinion of the jury members is that since Beiping also violated the rules, they should also be disqualified.</p>

<h3>50,000 Meter Race Walking Performance; Cai Zhengyi Achieves Amazing Result; Time of 4 Hours, 56 Minutes, and 10 Seconds, Only Six Minutes Off the Record; Only Cai and Zhang Zaojiu Complete the Entire Distance Among the Five Participants</h3>
<p>The 50,000-meter race walking performance was originally scheduled for six participants. However, Wang Jingren did not participate due to foot pain, so only Zhou Yuyu, Cai Zhengyi, Zhang Zaojiu, Zheng Chengshan, and Zhu Rongsheng, five people, started at 10:21 AM yesterday at the track and field stadium, circling the track three times, and then exiting the stadium from the east command stand at 10:33 AM. The order was Zhou, Zhu, Cai, Zhang, Zheng. Until 3:25 PM, during the polo performance, five gunshots were heard from the east command stand. Cai Zhengyi had already completed the entire distance and returned, walking like a woman with bound feet, twisting and turning. He walked another lap in the stadium and finished with a time of 4 hours, 56 minutes, and 10 seconds, only five minutes off the world record (the world record is 4 hours, 50 minutes, and 10 seconds). Chu Minyi, Mayor Wu, Zhang Boling, and others, seeing that this race walking lasted more than four hours and that the athletes were competing on an empty stomach, admired their spirit and immediately went to shake hands and offer their condolences. At 3:36 PM, Zhang Zaojiu also entered the stadium. The remaining three did not complete the entire distance and withdrew. If Cai Jun is given time and works hard, he will not find it difficult to break the world record.</p>

<h3>The 32nd Army Polo Team Performed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Yellow Team Won Over the Red Team with a Score of Eight to</p>
<p>Next Week, Four Matches Will Be Played Against Westerners in Jiangwan</p>
<p>The 32nd Army polo team, which has long been famous, gave its first performance yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the games stadium. Shanghai residents were eager to expand their horizons and watch this exciting ball sport, so the audience was quite enthusiastic. The performance was divided into the Red Team and the Yellow Team. After one hour, the Yellow Team won with a score of eight to . The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Heroic Spirit</p>
<p>Eight people participated in the performance, divided into the Red Team and the Yellow Team. They wore yellow and red long-barreled leather boots, riding pants, and white pith helmets. The Red Team wore red , and the Yellow Team wore yellow turn-down collar sports shirts with the 32nd Army insignia on the back and a horse shape on the left lapel. Everyone had a heroic spirit.</p>
<p>Tamed Horses</p>
<p>Each team prepared eight horses, with four horses being replaced for riding. The horse tails were decorated with red and yellow flags, and the horse necks also had red and yellow colored silk. Before the match, each horse was draped in red and yellow silk cloth. There were sixteen grooms taking care of the horses in the stadium. Each horse was exceptionally strong and had good training, so they were quite docile.</p>
<p>Match Situation</p>
<p>The field was larger than a soccer field. The goalposts had no crossbar, and the posts were surrounded by white cloth with two red flags inserted at the top. Each team had four players, two forwards and two defenders. There were a total of six periods, each lasting six minutes, with a three-minute break in between. A bell was used as the signal. Each time a goal was scored, the teams exchanged directions. The referee, Tong Zhen, also rode a white horse, galloping back and forth. He also had a ball pouch hanging on his horse for use at any time.</p>
<p>The Yellow Team Wins</p>
<p>The match started at 3:00 PM. Each knight mounted his saddle, and both sides circled half of the stadium before lining up at the center line. The referee threw a ball from the center line, and both sides began to fight fiercely. Each player used a T-shaped mallet to hit the ball hard. The ball was very small, and the horses were not moving, so hitting the ball was quite difficult. It was impossible to handle without skill. In the first period, the Yellow Team won 2-0. The second period was a 1-1 tie. In the third period, the Red Team won 1-0. In the fourth period, the Yellow Team won 3-2. The fifth period was a 1-1 tie. In the sixth period, the Red Team won 2-1. As a result, the Yellow Team won with a score of eight to . The roster of the Yellow Team is as follows:</p>
<p>Red Team Guo Tingzhi Yan Xueyi Li Peizhi Zhang Yinglong</p>
<p>Yellow Team Li Linbing Yang Guifang Han Shufen Pang Fuyan</p>
<p>Match Against Westerners</p>
<p>The team has agreed to play against the local Western polo team on the 21st, 23rd, 26th, and 28th of this month at 3:00 PM at the Jiangwan Racecourse. The match on the 26th is expected to be the most exciting. It is hoped that Shanghai residents will go at that time to watch the fierce battle.</p>

<h3>Admission Tickets Sold at Set Prices</h3>
<p>Since the opening of this National Games, it has been eight days, and the order has been good. Daily ticket prices are sold according to regulations. However, recently some unscrupulous people have been buying tickets and reselling them to others at inflated prices. After being discovered by the Games inspectors, they have been handed over to the Public Security Bureau for legal action. As for the Games ticket prices, regardless of the type of admission ticket, except for those sold on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Bank and the China Travel Service, all others are sold at the ticket booths. There is absolutely no reason to temporarily increase prices and hawk them. If the audience encounters such a situation in the future, they can report it at any time for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Shijie Flies to Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th) Wang Shijie is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 19th to preside over the closing ceremony of the National Games. Also, Lei Zhen went to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 17th to attend the National Games Awards Committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Small Ball Performance: Hong Kong vs. Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow, the King of Balls Personally Takes the Field</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong small ball team, led by King Li, will make its debut on the National Games stage on the 20th. The opponent is the Shanghai small ball team. It is the "invincible in all of Shanghai" small ball overlord All Black Team (recently renamed Lianghua). Of course, this unprecedented battle for the Chinese small ball throne will once again cause a sensation in Shanghai, creating a tense atmosphere of tens of thousands of people watching small ball. The first protagonist of the National Games small ball performance was the Shanghai mixed team against Hubei. Although the excitement could not keep up with the Hong Kong-Shanghai battle, that day, the ball-loving masses still stood shoulder to shoulder, unwilling to relax even half a step. Veterans knew that the two-corner stands would be crowded, so they would rather spend more money to buy six-corner tickets. Those who recognized the small ball battlefield knew that it was the tennis court at the south end of the athletic field. The two-corner ticket holders were in a "close to the water tower" position and were very satisfied with what they saw. Everyone was happy. The six-corner VIPs, on the other hand, frequently called "injustice" and "injustice" because of the distance. Ball fans must set off for the athletic field of the National Games at dawn the day after tomorrow. As long as you spend two corners and find a stand around number ten, you are guaranteed to be satisfied and say "good value for money." However, seats are limited, so mobilization should be quick, otherwise the site may be worrying and it will be too late to regret. The referees are Tang Zhongguang, Huang Bingxing, and Lu Shunde, who will serve as linesmen.</p>
<h3>Water Diving Performance Today</h3>
<p>The water diving performance was originally scheduled to be held on the 17th (yesterday) and the 19th (tomorrow). However, yesterday there were quite a few swimming finals, and Wang Zhengting presented the awards immediately after the competition. The men's 400-meter freestyle preliminary round was also held in six groups on the same day, which took a long time. Therefore, the conference temporarily announced that the water diving performance would be changed to today and tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee for the Chinese Sports Society Established Yesterday: Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Shao Rugan, and Six Others</h3>
<p>The Chinese Sports Society held its second preparatory meeting at Deli Apartment at 6:30 p.m. yesterday. More than thirty initiators attended, including Hao Gengsheng, Ma Yuehan, Cheng Dengke, Wu Zheng, Wu Yunrui, Wang Fudan, Fang Wanbang, Zhang Jiwu, Song Jun, Shu Hong, Ma Chonggan, Chen Shi, Zhang Huilan, Liu Shenzhen, Rong Qizhao, Jiang Lianggui, Xiao Guozhong, and Shang Rumei.

Then, Wang Fudan, Ma Yuehan, Zhang Jiwu, Fang Wanbang, and others spoke one after another. As a result of the discussion, Shao Rugan, Zhang Jiwu, and Chen Dengke were elected to sort out the draft constitution, and Yuan Dengli, Shen Siliang, Wu Yunrui, Cheng Ke, Hao Gengsheng, Zhang Jiwu, and six others were elected to the preparatory committee. It was decided to prepare for the establishment of the general assembly next year and research work. The preparatory committee will hold its first meeting today.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee of the North China Sports Federation Holds a Conversation Meeting Tonight to Decide the Location and Date of the Next North China Games</h3>
<p>Many executive committee members of the North China Sports Federation have recently come to Shanghai to attend the National Games.

<h3>National Goods Manufacturers Welcome Female Athletes at a Tea Party: More Than 500 People Attend, the Mermaid Representative Expresses Thanks</h3>
<p>Local national goods manufacturers such as Meya held a tea party at the International Hotel on the second floor at 5:00 p.m. yesterday to welcome all the female athletes of the National Games and invited Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Games, and members Zhang Boling, Pan Gongzhan, and Chu Minyi to attend and deliver speeches, giving many instructions on promoting national goods and cultivating national wealth. Finally, Yang Xiuqiong, the mermaid, delivered a speech to express thanks. It was not until about 7:00 p.m. that the event ended in joy. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Party Welcome</p>
<p>Meya Silk Weaving Factory, China Enamel Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Zhanghua Wool Spinning Factory, Yaguang Manufacturing Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, China First Knitting Factory, etc. welcomed the female athletes of the National Games at 5:00 p.m. yesterday and held a tea party in the large restaurant on the second floor of the International Hotel. A wooden frame was specially set up in the passage to display the products of each factory, which were dazzling. In the hall, a cloth banner was hung with the red characters "Promoting National Goods and Forging Physical Fitness are the Way to Revive the Nation," which attracted attention. The mermaid sisters, together with their father Yang Zhunan and friend Xia Xiaoxia, arrived first and sat around a table, chatting and laughing happily. Then more than 500 female athletes arrived one after another, and the seats were full. Those who arrived late were invited to the small restaurant on the fourteenth floor. After several music performances, the meeting began. The presidium included Cai Shengbai, Fang Yexian, Chen Nianpeng, Ren Shigang, Fang Jiange, Xu Yangnan, Zhang Huikang, and Xie Bingru.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>First, Chairman Cai Shengbai stood up and gave a welcome speech, saying that today, the national goods manufacturers welcome the female athletes of the Sixth National Games. It is a great honor to have you all here. The significance of our welcome is because young women have lofty aspirations, sound physical fitness, and gentle temperament, and they are the leaders of the Chinese nation in the future. Therefore, we are especially respectful and sincerely welcome the female athletes from all over the country and overseas Chinese to the Sixth National Games. We are all national goods factories, and the national goods we manufacture are daily necessities. The quality is not worse than imported goods. We dare to say that you will definitely believe and be willing to promote the purchase of Sichuan goods, because you young women regard "advocating national goods" as your own duty and believe that "recovering leakage" is as important as your promotion of sports. The purpose of your promoting sports is to strengthen the physical fitness of the people, and the purpose of our actively promoting national goods is to consolidate the lifeline of the country. We are standing on a horizontal line, but the things we manufacture must be promoted by young women so that the trend of the Chinese people completely purchasing national goods can easily become a reality, because the relationship between all national goods and women is particularly close. Some of you have returned to the country from Nanyang, and some have come to Shanghai from very remote inland areas, so we hope that you will give us guidance at any time on how to improve in the future, and we are willing to accept it sincerely. At the same time, we hope that you will take the purpose of our manufacturing national goods back to your hometowns and tell everyone about it. Promoting national goods and making the Chinese people completely purchase national goods is also the glorious work of young women. Because we are very rushed for time, we cannot invite all the national goods factories in the city to participate, but we dare to represent all the national goods factories in Shanghai or the whole country to express our respect to the female athletes, and very honestly and unceremoniously request you to give us more national goods publicity when the whole conference closes and you all go back to your hometowns. Today is very simple, there is only some respect to welcome you all and wish you physical and academic progress every day.</p>

<p>Guests' Speeches</p>
<p>Then Mayor Wu, Chu Minyi, Zhang Boling, and Pan Gongzhan delivered speeches one after another, elaborating on the relationship between promoting national goods and promoting sports. Chu said that our country is poor and weak and is laughed at by others. You have performed very well at the National Games. The achievements of the women are especially impressive (it can be seen that effort in sports can turn weakness into strength). We should promote more goods to enrich the economy and turn poverty into wealth.</p>
<p>Mermaid Thanks</p>
<p>Finally, the mermaid representative expressed her thanks, saying that it is a great honor to be invited by Meya and other national goods factories today. Promoting national goods is the responsibility of the people. Thank you for the earnest instructions from Mayor Wu and others. We will definitely work hard to promote and purchase them. We are very grateful for the warm hospitality today and would like to express our thanks on behalf of everyone. After the speech, tea and refreshments were served, and photos were taken. Each factory also presented many products. The young ladies from various places, having had the opportunity to visit the most magnificent hotel in Shanghai and received exquisite gifts from various factories, returned happily.</p>
<h3>Bicycle Performance Again Yesterday: Tan Meiguan's Skills are Very Good, Like Nezha Riding on Wind Fire Wheels</h3>
<p>Vietnamese Tan Meiguan gave his second performance at the National Games at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Whether lying down or standing up, suddenly advancing or retreating, his superb riding skills amazed the audience. The most remarkable thing was that he placed the bike on two small oranges, and Tan stood upside down on the bike, and the bike remained stable. This is indeed a rare spectacle.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xianyan of the Iron Gate Will Return to China Next Spring</h3>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, the iron gate of the Donghua football team, who is famous throughout the country, was sent by the Two Roads Bureau to the United States for railway practice in the early spring of last year. More than a year has passed since then. All football fans who love Zhou's beautiful skills miss him very much and yearn for him. According to news from the Road Bureau, Zhou has been diligent in his studies in the United States, but he has not neglected his football skills, so he practices whenever he has time. Now that Zhou's internship is about to end, he is scheduled to return to China next spring. If he can be selected at that time, he will represent our country at the World Games and show his skills.</p>
<h3>Snippets from the Venue</h3>
<p>The track and field competition has ended, and each unit is handing over, especially the women. Most of them have taken off their military uniforms and put on casual clothes. They are all competing for beauty in the most fashionable clothes. If it weren't for the badges on their chests, you wouldn't be able to tell that they were the athletes who were running and jumping on the sand a few days ago.</p>
<p>The audience at the venue has all crowded into the swimming pool these days. Yesterday, the tennis court was still lively because of the Shanghai-Java battle. The basketball hall and the track and field court were so quiet that all the seats were empty, which is very different from the first day.</p>
<p>The types of people who can move freely in the venue are (1) those who wear special badges, (2) referees performing their duties, (3) those who have long-term passes, (4) newspaper reporters, and (5) athletes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the women's basketball game between Shanghai and Jiangsu, an illiterate worker on the scoreboard mistakenly reversed the names of the Jiangsu players. The Jiangsu players said that they were unlucky and would definitely lose today.</p>
<p>Miss Meng Jianli changed her clothes three times yesterday. In the morning, she wore a black silk long cheongsam, in the afternoon she wore a yellow turn-down collar top and white suit pants, and in the evening she changed into a beautiful travel robe.</p>
<p>The mermaid Yang Xiuqiong was defeated by Liu Du in the 50-meter freestyle. Everyone was shocked and highly praised Liu's quality. In the future, the title of mermaid will definitely be transferred to Miss Liu.</p>
<p>In the battle between Lin Baohua and Xu Chengji, Baohua's wife, Ms. Liang Peiyu, watched the game from the sidelines and said several times that it was terrible when she saw Lin failing repeatedly.</p>
<p>A Miss said that Xu Chengji is young and beautiful, physically strong, has superb ball skills, and is also amiable and approachable, and can be called a standard man.</p>
<p>The National Games is about to close. The male and female athletes from various provinces gather together for a short time and then say goodbye. People are not made of wood or stone, so how can they be emotionless? Therefore, some give handkerchiefs or offer admonitions. Handbooks and colored silks fly together, and cherishing and exhortation are made together, adding a lot of good stories.</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and the weather is getting colder. The female athletes have nothing to do in their guest rooms, so they hold wool and add to their winter clothes. Sitting far away, it is like a picture of beauty, which can withstand long-term taste.</p>
<p>The female athletes of martial arts are all brave like warriors, and the archers hold the bright moon in their right hands and support Mount Tai in their left hands. Women have a relaxed spirit, and the Thirteenth Sister is not the only one who is beautiful in the past.</p>
<p>Wang Kai Photo Studio has a complete set of National Games photos, which can be brought back and given to old friends as a wonderful souvenir. Therefore, athletes are eager to buy them. Other sports books, such as those from Qinfen Bookstore, also have good sales these days, as they are also great gifts.</p>

<h3>Zhixin Girls' School Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhixin School was established to commemorate the martyr Zhu Zhixin. The school is large in scale and has about a thousand students. Recently, in order to raise funds for the construction of the Zhu Zhixin bronze statue and school buildings, the basketball and track and field teams were specially sent to Beijing and Shanghai to raise funds. It is reported that Zhixin's wife, Yang Dao, the principal, has gone to Beijing in advance to plan. As for the basketball team, led by team leaders Li Guoliang, Liu Jinwei, and Mo Gongbian, they arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The team members are mostly well-known figures in the south.

<h3>Finance Large Speculators Push Prices Higher, Gold Price Reaches $947.30; Heavy Manipulation Drives Arbitrary Price Increases, Shorts Suffer Great Losses; Rumors Abound, Resulting in a Sharp Rise of $14.40</h3>
<p>Yesterday, large buyers continued to push gold prices higher, leading to a corresponding tightness in the exchange rate market. Short sellers suffered heavy losses, and prices soared to a high of $947.30. Banks heavily sold, and large speculators unloaded their holdings, causing the market to stabilize. Initially, overseas silver markets showed a decline in England and stability in the United States. However, forward silver prices in Monte Carlo rose by 0.5 to 1.5 cents. Exchange rates continued to rise, and London spot gold fell by 1.5 pence. Reports indicated that the Bank of China stated that the exchange of old banknotes for new ones would not exceed the existing circulation.

The Central Bank's posted rates showed no change for British and American currencies, while the customs gold unit decreased by 3%. The standard gold price was posted at $927.70, causing the market to slightly weaken and decline. Banks actively sold shillings, leading to further weakness. However, due to the tight market conditions, some maintained support at lower prices, resulting in frequent rebounds. The HSBC posted rates also showed no change for British and American currencies. At this point, buyers and sellers were divided, and the market price fluctuated around the settlement price for quite some time. Later, with the Guangdong merchants heavily buying US dollars, banks became hesitant to sell, and the price broke through the $30 mark. Subsequently, the exchange rate market tightened, and market sentiment improved. The extremely dry market conditions further fueled buying interest, leading to continuous price increases. Predictions indicated a 7-anna reduction in Indian silver, and the Hong Kong market softened further. Mei Foo also had settlement news, and the market strengthened further at noon. After closing, instead of falling, the market rose again, with improved market sentiment and strong buying pressure from large speculators. Rumors circulated about Hong Kong devaluing its currency, and the market immediately broke through the $40 mark. However, due to sellers offering notes at high prices, there was much consolidation in the middle. HSBC repeatedly revised its posted rates downward, and the exchange rate market became exceptionally tight. The market was filled with buying interest, especially with strong buying pressure from the buyers. Short sellers suffered heavy losses, and prices soared to $947.30.

After entering the market, certain banks and large speculators unloaded their notes, and selling pressure began to ease. Banks and Qiao Zhibu promptly sold, and the Hong Kong market also eased. The domestic market hardened and retreated to within the $40 range. Indian silver was reported stable for the second time, and the market finally fluctuated.

<h3>Securities Market: Bond Market Has Deviated From the Norm</h3>
<p>Large Fluctuations and Active Trading… Only Three Sessions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua Shang Securities Exchange experienced market fluctuations that were so bizarre that they deviated from the normal trend of the bond market. Moreover, the market rose in adverse circumstances, clearly due to financial manipulation. Regrettably, although the near-term and long-term market prices were getting closer, they still failed to attract arbitrage interest. From this, it can be seen that the long side had difficulty finding a way out, forcibly raising prices. Tensions from rumors in North China, short positions became more fortified. The future is still not dared to be optimistic. The previous day had failed to follow the rebound to continue rising. The market price became weaker. The 22nd series bonds for this month, fell sharply by 6.5 jiao. New low prices were discovered, and all were sold. The North Gang and numbers 54, 73, and 78 were the most active in selling. Number 72 slightly covered shorts, and numbers 4 and 16 also slightly sold. The second session saw the 6% bonds rise sharply by 7 jiao, and the rest also trended higher, but the buyers were still mostly scattered. The afternoon opening was delayed, and only one session was conducted. Rumors circulated that financial institutions were pulling up prices. Number 11 had significant buying, and retail investors covered, creating a lively atmosphere. However, adverse late-night news made it difficult to reverse the declining market sentiment. Judging from the fact that the consolidated tax bonds only rose by about 8 jiao, and the 6% bonds only rose by 5.1 jiao, it did not appear to be a rebound. The market price results, rose from 2 jiao to 9 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 25 million yuan. A table is provided below comparing the results of the rises and falls (in yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Differing Views of Longs and Shorts; Yarn and Cotton Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: Prices fall, the situation is confused, and market sentiment is divided. Still affected by rumors, the market shows uncertainty. The long side is supported by the declining yarn inventory in various factories and the stable overseas market. However, the short side views the situation as unfavorable, with securities taking steps to create new low prices, targeting a bearish outlook. Therefore, the long and short sides compete fiercely.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Falls 6-7 Jiao</p>
<p>The morning opening of the standard yarn market saw a relatively flat near-term market, while the far-term market tended to decline. At that time, rumors were rampant, and the second session was particularly weak. However, by the third session, the upward trend suddenly turned higher. Towards the close, rumors suddenly arose. Public and large sellers rushed in, and the market price fell. As a result, each month fell by 5, 7, 8, and 9 jiao compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening heard of the high price of gold, reaching over 947 yuan. The rumors grew stronger, and the market was briefly stimulated, with each month rising by 5 and 6 jiao. After the second session, a slight decline was seen. Shen Ji and Chang Feng sold off in large quantities. As a result, each month rose by 1 and 3 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yu Da sold 400 bales, Zhen Da 300 bales, Sen Kang 1,300 bales, Shen Ji 1,350 bales, Chang Feng 1,900 bales, Sheng Yuan 950 bales, Yong Chang 950 bales, Xin Chang 650 bales, and Chang Yu 550 bales. Xin Chang bought 1,000 bales, Yuan Da 900 bales, Jin Chang 1,050 bales, Ming De 650 bales, Geng Feng 1,650 bales, Yi Chang 400 and 500 bales, and Heng Chang 450 bales. The highest closing prices of the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Oct | 175.4 | 174.9 | 175.4 | Rose 0.40 | 22,150</p>
<p>Nov | 175.7 | 174.7 | 174.8 | Fell 0.60 | 47,450</p>
<p>Dec | 175.3 | 174.2 | 174.4 | 0.70 | 66,550</p>
<p>Jan | 174.7 | 173.9 | 174.0 | 0.60 | 52,600</p>
<p>Feb | 175.3 | 174.3 | 174.4 | 0.80 | 36,350</p>
<p>Mar | 175.9 | 175.0 | 175.0 | 0.40 | 15,70</p>
<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 250,800</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Falls Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good, more than before. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 765 bales throughout the day, and the price fell by 0.5 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>Nanjing 15, Nanyang 10, Inland 145, Changsha 395, Tianjin 15, Shantou 50, Guangdong 100, Hankou 25, Counterpart 10</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then strengthened, but recently, due to the less active yarn sales, the factories' demand for raw materials has turned dull. Therefore, most in the industry tend to sell short. However, the gold price is rising, and rumors are rampant, and there are also many who are doing long.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Near Term Falls, Far Term Rises</p>
<p>The morning opening of the standard cotton market saw the near-term market weaken, but the far-term market tightened and rose. Because of the rising gold price news, retail investors covered their shorts and rose. After the second session, due to the falling yarn market, rumors spread, and market sentiment suddenly weakened. The selling pressure was even stronger at the close. As a result, each month fell by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening heard that the gold price was rising sharply, and the market fluctuated and rose. However, new buyers were not very enthusiastic. As a result, each month rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Geng Feng sold 700 piculs, Yuan Yi 2,800 piculs, Yi Cheng 700 piculs, Sheng Yuan 1,700 piculs, Tong He 1,700 piculs, Da Fu 600 piculs, Shen Ji 1,000 piculs, Yong Da 900 piculs, Rui Yuan 1,300 piculs, and Xin Heng 1,200 piculs. Yuan Da bought 1,900 piculs, Yi Chang 1,000 piculs, Chang Feng 2,400 piculs, Xin Cheng 3,000 piculs, Tai Chang 3,600 piculs, Ri Chang 1,400 piculs, and Chang He 2,300 piculs. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Supply Exceeds Demand</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption has turned quiet again, and factory demand is particularly sluggish. The source is estimated to be 1,896 bales of Yao cotton and 3,000 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Coarse Lint 35.00 Shin Shin Factory Buys 300 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Yao Cotton 35.50 Also 1,200 Bales Also Also</p>
<h3>American Cotton Quietly Awaiting Market Developments</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with each month rising 1 to 4 points. The Liverpool news was good, and speculators and local firms bought. There was a lack of large-scale hedging. Off-market transactions were very limited. Firms are waiting for developments in Europe and the Supreme Court's ruling on the reorganization case. Subsequently, due to the weakness of the wheat market and hedging sales, the market price softened. Current demand is active, and Southern feet are solid. The closing was stable. The current spot price was unchanged, and the futures price rose 1 to 2 points. English cotton spot futures rose 1 point. Indian cotton saw long covering, and long and speculators bought. Pirgaon and Oomra fell 1.25 rupees, and Broach fell 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 16th).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 17th Broach cotton flower was 215.5 rupees, a decrease of 0.5 rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs Wheat Futures Fall, Future Flour and Wheat Inevitably Loosen</h3>
<p>The flour market unanimously sees a flat trend.  As foreign wheat prices are reported, Chicago continues to fall by 6.5 to 10 cents per bushel, and Canada falls by 10 cents per bushel. Market sentiment, due to the large drop in foreign wheat, inevitably adds to concerns about the situation abroad. Although domestic wheat is hoarding endlessly, it should not be underestimated too much. However, speculative customers dare not rush to buy, so transactions are not very smooth, and prices also fall by 1 to 2 cents per bushel.  By the afternoon opening, the market for each month was roughly stable.</p>
<p>Although prices were seen to be high, the market did not move. Because the difference between domestic and foreign wheat is quite large, and the market within and outside are disconnected, domestic markets will eventually have to address this matter.</p>
<p>Wheat is generally flat and lacks momentum. Because foreign wheat prices are reported to be approaching fatigue, market sentiment is inevitably loosened. According to insiders' news, the asking prices for foreign wheat have been quite inconsistent recently. If the various factories are truly determined, a transaction may be possible. However, the shipping dates cannot be as certain as in previous years. With this situation, buyers are difficult to excite. Transactions for each month are not smooth, and they are back by 2.25 cents per bushel and are not long. Due to customers' thoughts of hoarding, existing wheat is even more difficult for factory owners to approach. It is heard that the highest-quality goods are being quoted at $4.47 per bushel, but no transactions have been seen.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market has heard that Canadian bullish companies are heavily selling, and the market is weak. Export demand is minimal, and the exchange's account balance is extremely large.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over forty sources arrived in South Shanghai (a total of more than 9,000 shi of goods). Coupled with slow sales, the market was difficult to recover. Prices for both thick-husked and thin-husked rice all continued to fall by 10 to 20 cents per shi. Only 600-700 bags of Yantai and Qingdao rice were sold, and prices showed no ups or downs. There were also 500-600 bags of kiln-dried rice sold. Sales of Bago rice were only retail, and the volume was limited. Thick, new japonica rice fell by 10 to 20 cents per shi. Due to the imbalance between supply and demand of Du Yang and other varieties of new top-quality rice, prices were again falling outside the normal range. New and old rice of various origins all weakened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than forty sources arrived in North Shanghai and He Xia. The market was slow to sell thick-husked japonica rice, new japonica rice, and white rice. Prices declined by another 10 to 20 cents per shi. Thin rice, kiln-dried rice, and Bago rice also fell slightly outside the normal range. Sales of Du Jian and Bu Jian rice were sluggish, and prices were slightly outside the normal range. New Yang Jian rice was quoted high, but medium-grade and lower-grade rice weakened by nearly 10 cents per shi. Customer-grade rice turned out to be more favorable, and other goods also showed weakness.</p>
<h3>Foreign Company Sesame Fluctuates Greatly</h3>
<p>Since the opening price of sesame by foreign firms at 9.5 yuan, market sentiment has been brisk. Previously, Jardine Matheson completed a transaction of 400 tons at a price of 9.5 yuan, 5 cents per ton. Yesterday, due to rumors and a large supply, hoarders intended to release their holdings. The market suddenly showed a trend of large increases and small pullbacks. Jardine Matheson then continued to buy 500 tons at a price of 9.45 yuan, still with delivery scheduled for November and December. As the supply of forward goods surged and sales decreased slightly in various places, the market immediately showed signs of loosening. Soybean prices have fallen to date. However, due to active cake sales, Northeast soybeans and car soybeans once showed signs of recovery in the market. However, the Dalian market is still in a weak state, and market sentiment in this city has softened. Fortunately, factories continue to purchase. Yesterday, 18 cars of Sipingjie soybeans and 1 car of Bengbu soybeans were sold. Jiading and Pudong soybeans are still available.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Tianjin Red Dates Officially Open</h3>
<p>Tianjin red dates, the official new crop, have arrived and are now available. High-grade red dates are priced at 25-26 yuan, second-grade at 22 yuan, first-grade red dates at 16-17 yuan to 14-15 yuan, and second-grade red dates at 13-14 yuan to 11-12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware Black Sheet Iron Prices Rise Frequently</h3>
<p>The fixed price of black sheet iron was upside down in the past few months, and very few orders were placed. Since the intervention of Yi Chang Yong Xiang Tai of the Qingdao group and Da Xin San Yi Tai Wan Feng Tai and other numbers of the Tianjin group, they have started to handle them. This street's thermos bottle factory, enamel factory, etc. are also continuing to add more, so the standard has been raised a lot. The initial price of 2.6-foot, 18-gauge patterned sheets was 7.70-7.80 yuan, and now it is impossible to obtain a price below 9 yuan. The initial price of 3.6-foot, 3-6-gauge patterned sheets was 7 yuan, but now it cannot be obtained below 7.5 yuan. The recent price of 7-10-gauge sheets is estimated at 8-9 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Scholar Who Sold Books in Jinling and Bian</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Chapter 24 of *A Brief History of Civilization* mentions a book merchant who went to Jinan to take the imperial examination.  He is described as "a hero of great reform," who came from an orthodox background and was a successful scholar for several years.  Because he often traveled to study, he "became a leader of reform." He went there to sell books, and also took the examination himself. Afterwards, he wrote a book called *Record of Selling Books in Jinan*. Li Boyuan vilified him in a biography. When I read it at the time, I suspected that it referred to someone specific, but I couldn't pinpoint who.</p>
<p>Later, when I read the *Compilation of the癸卯New People's Journal*, I saw an article titled *Reading the Record of Selling Books in Jinling*, and I suddenly understood. According to the journal, this book was written by someone unknown, and the author was said to be "a scholar, a writer, and a patriot."  The journal praised the book, saying that "even a small piece shows spirit," and quoted sections on novels, translation, and the writing of examination candidates to show its content. At that time, I had a strong desire to read it, but I had no chance to obtain it.</p>
<p>Later, when the *Laiqing Pavilion* book catalog was published, I found this book listed, along with *Record of Selling Books in Bianliang*, attributed to Liang Qichao. I was overjoyed, but when I went to buy it, it had already been purchased by someone else. Afterwards, I often regretted not being able to see this book. Recently, I passed by *Cuibaozhai* and saw the owner had a copy of *Record of Selling Books in Bianliang* by his bedside. I asked him if he had ever received *Record of Selling Books in Jinling*. The owner said, "Yes, I do, but I don't know where it is." I entrusted him with finding it, but I was still afraid of not getting it. Until yesterday, I personally searched through piles of books with the owner for several hours before I finally found it. My joy can be imagined.</p>
<p>The book was not written by Liang Qichao, but signed as "Gong Nu." Judging from the content, it was probably the owner of the "Kaiming Bookstore" at that time. Li Boyuan's book was actually a veiled reference to this gentleman, and many of the facts were fabricated. *Record of Jinling* is one volume, writing about the selling situation of various books and the advantages and disadvantages that make them sell well or poorly, "to give those who introduce civilization a more accurate direction." The lower part describes the various living conditions of examination candidates inside and outside the examination hall, and a general overview of their knowledge, "to show the current state of society." The year described is the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu, Renyin (1902). *Record of Bianliang* was written the following year and is divided into three volumes: the first volume is about selling books, the second is a travelogue, and the third is a biographical account of people. The book mentions *Record of Jinling*, falsely claiming that the book was written by a friend:</p>
<p>"Record of Selling Books in Jinling was written last year by a friend, and describes the social conditions of the interior with great vividness. Here, it is a non-selling item. When encountering characters similar to those in the record, they are thrown at them as medicine. Within ten days, many people asked for it. Some praised its breadth of knowledge, while others praised the skill of its writing. They compared its transitions to the Yu tripod, which is too much. However, as a tool for opening up fame and profit, nothing surpasses it. One day, a customer entered proudly, selected dozens of books, and immediately said it was not good, and put it down. He picked up another book and did the same. My friend who was tending the counter, also a successful scholar, asked him what subject he studied. He answered loudly: Jiawu. He continued to read books as before. The words 'successful candidate' in his mind had swollen to the extreme, so his external appearance was also enormous and he did not realize it. Then he selected several books and asked: Is there a discount? The answer was no. Then his nose responded with a snort. He asked again: Can I owe you? The answer was no. He responded with an even louder snort. My colleagues knew that it could only be cured by medicine, and quickly presented him with Record of Selling Books in Jinling. The customer received it and asked about the price, and was told that it was not for sale. He and his companion then looked at it together. Before they had read a few lines, the two men looked at each other and spoke in a dialect that was unintelligible. Suddenly, they threw the book down, blushed, and fled."</p>
<p>This example shows the contents of the two records. They are both works of condemnation. Although the books are both short and small, there are two points that are very commendable. The first is the exposure of the lives, thoughts, and various ugly states of the examination candidates. The second is the progress of the movement and its shortcomings seen from the point of view of "business." The two records are not great books, but they allow later generations to see a partial image of the cultural aspects of that time, which is valuable. The *New People's Journal*'s criticism focused on the point of "borrowing a mirror."</p>
<p>For example, *Record of Jinling*'s discussion of novels: "Novels that do not sell are mostly incompatible with the novel genre. They are either too straightforward or too brief; they are either too lofty or too vulgar. The writing is not sufficient to support its purpose, and the reader cannot obtain the pleasure of reading a novel. Even those who try their best to write in an elegant style are still far from the study of rhetoric. Covering the paper with words, it only feels repulsive and not enough to move people. In the new novel world today, *Uncle Tom's Cabin* and the fifteen young heroes of the *New People's Daily*, I can guarantee with a hundred mouths that they will definitely sell well. *Stories of Beauty Managing a Country* is second best. However, Longxi is a giant among novelists, and if his *Floating City Tales* were to be evaluated by a rhetorician, there would be a great spectacle." In the latter two sections, it is commented that "the novels of today, as the saying goes, 'open your mouth and you can see your throat,' how can they move people?" We can see how the author discusses scholarship from the point of view of "business." His discussion of the shortcomings of translated books and historical books is especially profound. The most interesting is the writing about how the examination candidates buy books on physiology:</p>
<p>"...When they see the diagrams, they are overjoyed. But they are afraid that others will see them, so they come to buy them at night. They avoid teachers and friends, dismiss their followers, and come alone when there are few people. When they choose them, they point with their hands, but do not speak. Those who are slightly more upright regard them as leisure books, as if they are dispensable, and take them to pass the long days...A completely corrupt scholar's air is vividly written. However, on the other hand, what is presented is another posture: "The examination candidates on Examination Hall Street are unparalleled, and there is nothing to compare to them. When they swagger through the market, everything they sweep down are merchants. Their rampant behavior can be seen. Therefore, at the end of this book, there are sketches of the five or six changes of the examination candidates, inside and outside the examination hall, to exhaust their forms and criticize them to the extreme. As for their understanding of new learning, they know nothing outside of the *Current Affairs Compendium*, and most of them have not even read the *Current Affairs Compendium*."</p>
<p>As *Record of Jinling* says: "The books of Li Hongzhang and Kang Youwei are most likely to raise their questions. Those who see them are often surprised and say: What is Li Hongzhang? They are told: It is his biography. Then why is there no word 'biography'? They shake their heads and click their tongues endlessly." Also, for example: "One day, someone asked about the *Asian Earth Globe Map*, and a guest was present, causing a roar of laughter. The person was initially ashamed, but then said: I clearly saw the name of this book in the newspaper, I suppose your shop does not have it. He nodded and left." Even "there are those who point to Ningbo and Hong Kong and ask what they mean," their ridiculousness and pitiableness can be seen. The *New People's Journal*'s praise of *Record of Jinling* is indeed worthy of praise.</p>
<p>*Record of Jinling* is best at writing about the lives of examination candidates, while *Record of Bianliang* specially writes about the sour attitude of examination candidates buying books. To expand on this, it writes in more detail about the situation of selling books. Some even pretend to be poor and distressed, begging for help, or borrowing from neighbors and running away in order to save a penny. The pot-bellied "successful candidate" mentioned at the beginning is also one of these characters. Comparing the two records, it can also be seen that Jiangnan is indeed much more open than the north. *Record of Bianliang* has a passage that describes the situation of buying books:</p>
<p>"When reading the book catalog, most of them are like reading the books of the Eastern Library, not distinguishing the categories of the book. They point to a book and take it to read, holding the book with both hands and flipping through it from the middle, looking left and right. Each flip turns several pages, and then they close the book again and point to another volume, doing the same. Sometimes a few kinds, sometimes more than a dozen kinds. Sometimes it takes several minutes, sometimes an hour. When asked what book they want, they are shocked and do not know how to answer. Those who ask to see the preface and table of contents first are one or two out of ten. When they have chosen a book, they haggle over the price, thinking that there must be a discount. As a result, several leave without buying every day."</p>
<p>The examination candidates there were probably like this, with little interest in new books. Therefore, the author had to change his plan and focus on writing about the ugly state of examination candidates buying books, because he could not "borrow this to examine and reform." Comparing the two books, *Record of Jinling* is superior, and its social depiction is extremely strong, unlike *Record of Bianliang*, which focuses on "travel," "friends," and is more focused on private life. I am finally fortunate to see this book to see the situation at that time. If there are people of this generation who still exist, witnessing the progress of the world over the past forty years, and rereading this book, recalling their surprise at "new learning" at that time, I wonder how they will be silent or sigh!</p>
<h3>The Sound of Rain</h3>
<p>— Chen Lin</p>
<p>The sound of rain in the autumn night is sorrowful. Reading the lines "The autumn wind is strong, the rain is gentle, there are three or two banana trees outside the curtain, how can a person endure the long night!" we will naturally have a feeling of sadness! However, the autumn rain sent by the autumn wind is lively in tone and bright in color. Although the autumn wind cannot send away all the autumn rain, the bitterness we receive when listening to the bursts of howling and rushing sounds can still be said to be a vivid bitterness! The sound of rain in the spring night is beautiful! "The wind and rain came last night, how many flowers have fallen!" The color of the rain is not only very bright, but when we think of the scene of flowers falling all over the path and swallows cutting red mud in the morning, even our dreams are permeated with smiles. Only the sound of plum rain in the summer night, dim and gloomy, has the most extreme taste of desolation! There is no light thunder to break the dullness, and even the sounds outside the rain cannot be heard. The sound of droplets dripping, dripping, dripping, without wind, without movement, without the monotonous sound of a period, weaves a net of melancholy, covering gray hope.</p>
<p>Like this sound of rain filled with gray sound and bitterness, I think even the ingenious pen of a genius would find it difficult to express through the medium of images.</p>
<p>The sound of the xiao flute wailing under the moon, although it may cause widows to cry in the middle of the night, always has moonlight, cloud light, and maybe even emerald sleeves leaning on the building, all of which are swaying with beautiful shadows. The cuckoo's bitter singing can be said to be desperate, but life has finally come to an end, the pain has been relieved, and the poet Keats sings of death, and regards death as a kind of eternal life, a kind of endless happiness. Death is not something to be afraid of. Only the sound of dripping rain in the summer night, dripping drop by drop, drop by drop, is like a steamed bun lying in a steamer. The heart is still alive, but the breath is suffocated by boredom. It is more hopeless than climbing the ten thousand dangers of the Shu Road, and more terrifying than escaping into the dark land of ghosts.</p>
<p>The entire space of heaven and earth is filled with the sound of boredom, without a single gap. It further drips into my flesh, my blood vessels, and the depths of my soul. Wherever the sound of rain drips, the waves of boredom rush to rise. I suddenly think of the several morning glory flowers in my garden, which should be in full bloom at this time, but I am afraid that they will also be crushed by the sound of rain and wither in the waves of boredom! My sister's tombstone is probably also overturned by the rain. The desolate mountain is lonely, and where should her helpless lonely spirit hide?</p>
<p>When I am full of vitality, I can still dispel pessimism and think that I am also a youth. If I can work hard, maybe I can do some work that human beings need. But now, curled up in this boring sound of rain, I can't help but be attacked by this sense of sadness!</p>
<p>I shudder, and suddenly two cold liquids wriggle at the corners of my eyes.</p>
<h3>Fable</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>In "Tolstoy's Confession" there is a good fable, which is very good to describe the people of our era. He said:</p>
<p>"A traveler in the wild was chased by a beast, and rushed into a dry well, but saw a poisonous dragon at the bottom of the well, grinning and wanting to devour him. This unfortunate traveler did not dare to climb out, for fear of being destroyed by the beast, nor did he dare to jump down, for fear of being swallowed by the poisonous dragon, but tightly grasped the small branches growing in the cracks of the well. His hands gradually weakened, and he felt that he was about to be destroyed by the beasts above or below, but he still grabbed it. Then he saw two small mice, one black and one white, turning back and forth on the stem of the small branch, and gnawing at it. The small branch was about to be bitten off, and he was about to fall into the claws of the dragon, and he saw that there was no escape. At this time, he looked around and saw a few drops of honey on the leaves of the small branch, so he licked it with his tongue."</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is really not a fable, everyone knows that this is the truth, especially the truth about the general situation of people now.</p>
<p>There are beasts above, poisonous dragons below, and mice in the middle are biting the small branches he is clinging to, maybe the small branches will break at that time, at this critical moment, he is not afraid of anything, and knows his inevitable fate. At this time, he found a little honey and licked it with peace of mind, knowing that it would be useless to not lick it, he would always fall into the well and be eaten by the poisonous dragon, so it is better to take a little sweet taste in the moment before falling.</p>
<p>Is our era, our environment, like beasts and poisonous dragons, I don't need to make this assertion. But I dare to assert that our era does not need people who temporarily lick honey, although our fate has been doomed to be ruined by beasts and poisonous dragons, but we might as well go up and fight with the beasts, or go down into the well and fight with the poisonous dragons, although we are going to be torn to pieces by it, but it is better to die like this than to die obediently, or maybe we can not die and get a way out.</p>
<p>Our era does not need people who temporarily lick honey, and then obediently give their lives to poisonous dragons and beasts!</p>
<h3>A Certain Night (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>From the words of the man and woman, I could guess that these three people were from Anhui, and must have fled from that area. Indeed, the flood in Anhui was not small. However, how could I do good deeds as the woman said? As for me personally, although I have recently found a night job, which can be considered a career, this is also something that I don't know if I'll have tomorrow. Moreover, even if I could afford it, what reason would I, a single man, have to buy a child and add trouble? How would I feed him? Wouldn't the child suffer even more with me? A child who has lost his mother will never grow up well. Furthermore, even if I did good deeds to them and bought the child, would that really save them? I don't necessarily see it that way. I don't know how many refugees have suffered the same flood as them, and even if I save these three, I still can't save others! No, I can't do it. I have nothing to say. But I was shaking my head to express my regret that I could not help.</p>
<p>They probably had great hope for me at first, but my expression made them too disappointed. The man's eyes fell down in despair, nailing themselves to the ground and not moving; the woman looked at the child's face in disappointment, and then put her face against the child's face.</p>
<p>Why am I not a great philanthropist? Wouldn't I be able to help them? But the eyes of the real philanthropists probably don't have the chance to see such a picture of the common people, right?</p>
<p>"Sir," the man opened his mouth again, reaching out to touch the child's dry, thin hand. "Can't you really do a good deed? Alas! There are too few good people in this world. Sir, without this child, everything would be easier. Adults can endure cold and hunger, but children can't, and their cries will make your heart ache like a knife. There's no way, I don't want to watch the child suffer with us, so I want to sell him. Maybe he can get a bowl of rice to eat if he's sold to someone else." He paused, as if he had remembered something else, and looked at the woman's body. "There's another root, sir, don't you see that her belly is big again? The poorer people are, the faster the children come, I really don't know what the reason is."</p>
<p>I couldn't move my feet at all, as if two nails had grown, firmly nailed into the ground. I forgot my schedule. I thought of the local disaster relief efforts, wouldn't this give them a way out? I asked:</p>
<p>"Didn't you go to the relief association? They should have a way."</p>
<p>This is what I saw in the newspaper. I was afraid that they didn't know that there was such a charitable organization in the local area, so I told them to ask for relief. The man said that he had just left there yesterday, and there was no good way inside. They were just sending the refugees back to their hometowns ship by ship, and they were not allowed to stay there. The hometown was flooded and there was nothing left, so wouldn't it be the same to go back and starve? If they wanted to go back, why did they run away in the first place! I asked him if they gave out money, and he said that there was no money, only boat tickets. There was food on the boat. If you didn't get on the boat and go home, you had to leave there. They didn't take in people who just lived and ate for free.</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of a radio suddenly came from the Western-style house. Singing "Good brother" and "Good sister," and there was a young woman learning to sing. The silent night was broken. The man and woman listened with straight eyes, as if there was something inside that could make them forget their hunger! They completely forgot that there was me in front of them! What were they listening to? Were they really enjoying the music? Why were tears flowing from their eyes again, drop by drop?…</p>
<h3>Heavenly Questions</h3>
<p>— Fan Hai</p>
<p>Even if fathers, elders, siblings and sisters meet one day, a burst of laughter will probably not solve the heavy worries! Just say that you see her whom you have been missing for so long, probably you will only blush in vain, and worry your heart, a burst of breathlessness, in selfless intoxication, will you not open your clear eyes again? The journey you have traveled, you can't remember how long, seeing the footprints you left behind are so heavy and bitter, you know that the naked soles of your feet are already cracked and thick, is this not enough? Why are you willing to put your worries as the first mark on her clear and innocent forehead? What will you put on her arm in a few years?</p>
<h3>Honorary Old Woman (10)</h3>
<p>— By Jiang Maxiu, translated by Ren Jun</p>
<p>"I think so too. This is entirely thanks to the Emperor's blessing. I really don't deserve it. Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha."</p>
<p>Soon, the remains were transported. It is said that the old woman placed them between her sick husband and herself, hugging them overnight as if they were alive.</p>
<p>At the funeral, important figures from the town gathered, each kindly attending to everything. During this time, the cooking old woman was completely like someone with a fever, noisily making a ruckus, sometimes talking nonsense, sometimes laughing loudly. Suddenly, she didn't know what she remembered, so she bought a lot of refreshments, gathered many poor children from nearby outside the door, and distributed the refreshments to them to eat.</p>
<p>"Hey, everyone," she said, seemingly satisfied as she gazed at the children greedily eating the refreshments she had given, "When you grow up, you must become great people. You must all be like my son, Yongzao, and become great soldiers, serving the country. Hmm, do you know what honor is? Those who don't know what honor is are simply not human. Hey, I'll give you more refreshments to eat, to become great people. Now the old woman is a rich person. You probably don't know, but I have already received a large sum of three hundred taels from the government. This is entirely thanks to Yongzao's blessing. You are able to receive refreshments like this now also thanks to Yongzao's blessing. Do you understand? Hey?"</p>
<p>Then, she scattered the remaining refreshments on the road; with tears in her eyes, she cheerfully gazed at the children scrambling to pick them up and eat them.</p>
<p>On the night accompanying the spirit, the old woman again took out that "cat skin" instrument and played it randomly amidst the crowd of people. She also sang all kinds of songs, the lyrics and tunes all messed up. She even openly sang extremely discordant songs loudly. Moreover, she often opened her red mouth wide and laughed loudly. At this time, the area in front of the door was densely packed with people.</p>
<p>The sound of the "cat skin" instrument continued for about an hour or so. Then, the old woman disappeared behind the paper door; after a while, she appeared before everyone wearing a military uniform that she didn't know where she had borrowed. A golden meritorious service medal of the sixth class shone brightly on her chest.</p>
<p>However, the appearance of the old woman with disheveled hair wearing a military uniform was truly bizarre. Moreover, for that military uniform, her weak and frail body was far too small. Her hands and feet were completely hidden inside the clothes, and with each step she took, her hands and feet moved within the wide clothing.</p>

<h3>Saying a Few Words for the Sub-Tenants</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, in order to vigorously promote the realization of a 40% rent reduction, issued a second official statement the day before yesterday, and began a general mobilization, requesting all shops and residents to sign, preparing to send representatives to Beijing to petition the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. It seems that the rent reduction movement in this city will achieve its rent reduction goals in order to alleviate the pain of the citizens' rent burden.</p>
<p>The rent reduction movement is something everyone should express sympathy for. Because this is the unanimous demand of all Shanghai citizens. However, as this movement is proceeding enthusiastically, we still have a question, that is, does the rent reduction movement represent all tenants in the city, or only some of the secondary landlords? Logically speaking, since the rent reduction movement is the unanimous demand of all citizens, it should represent the former, not the latter. However, looking at the actions of the rent reduction movement, the so-called rent reduction movement seems to only represent general shops and secondary landlords, and sub-tenants have not been mentioned. This is a major flaw.</p>
<p>We must know that among those who rent houses in this city, in addition to shops and secondary landlords, there are also so-called sub-tenants. And the burden of rent is directly on the secondary landlords, and indirectly on the sub-tenants. To be honest, those who bear the heavy burden of expensive rent in Shanghai are only the sub-tenants, who make up the majority of all residents. Most of the secondary landlords do not rent out their own houses. If they are good at managing, they may even have surplus profit from building rooms on top of their houses. Therefore, the rent reduction movement, if it only represents secondary landlords, is not thorough. It must also include sub-tenants in order to be universal and beneficial to the majority of citizens.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that the secondary landlords ask the main landlords to reduce rent, and once the main landlords' rent is reduced, not only the secondary landlords will benefit, but the sub-tenants will also benefit. Because once the goal pursued by the secondary landlords is achieved, the rent for the sub-tenants can naturally also be reduced. This sounds good, but the reality is not so. For example, since the rent reduction movement occurred in this city, most of the real estate operators only know how to seek profit and disregard the overall situation. However, there is no lack of those who understand the situation deeply and automatically reduce rent. However, as a result of the rent reduction, the burden on the secondary landlords has indeed been reduced, but the sub-tenants still have to pay high rent. Among them, even the few who reduced rent only reduced a small amount.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the rent reduction movement should be universal. The main landlords' rent should be reduced, and the secondary landlords' rent should also be reduced accordingly. Only in this way can the burden on all residents of this city be truly reduced. Otherwise, the demand for rent reduction will only benefit some secondary landlords, and will not have much impact on the majority of sub-tenants.</p>
<h3>Late Autumn</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>In the morning, carrying a book, I strolled into the park, walking along the grass path covered with fallen yellow leaves, walking in the sparse forest; my mood was as gloomy and sentimental as this bleak autumn. I often sighed, looking at the thin white clouds in the sky. I am surrounded only by sorrow, not joy; the reality of the environment symbolizes my entire fate, because there is only autumn in my life!</p>
<p>Occasionally I see people looking at me, but I feel that this sharp gaze seems to have a kind of sarcasm aimed at me. It makes me afraid, makes me ashamed, so recently I am a little unwilling to see even relatives and friends; because they will all shoot at me with that sharp gaze.</p>
<p>Alone, I sat down on a dew-covered chair by the pond in the corner of the park, flipping through a "Selected Collection of Lu Xun's Miscellaneous Thoughts", forcing myself to read half a page, and then threw it away. I leaned my heavy body against the back of the chair, looking up at the clear and calm sky, the sky was so clear and peaceful, like the weather in April. At this time, a few small birds flew over the treetops above, touching those branches, and a dry leaf floated down rustlingly, it happened to fall on my face, and I subconsciously crumpled it in my hand and it turned to powder.</p>
<p>——It's late autumn! The days really pass too easily, in just a blink of an eye, another autumn has quietly flown past in my life, but isn't winter about to come again? I am more afraid of winter than autumn, because I have no way to deal with this lonely, long winter!</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>More than twenty precious autumns have passed in such an ordinary, worthless way, just like flowing water, never to return.</p>
<p>Getting up from the chair, I picked up the book and walked silently along the pond. The remaining lotus flowers in the pond had only a few incomplete scorched leaves left, looking haggard and pitiful as they floated on the water, but the dewdrops on the grass shone brightly under the sun.</p>
<p>The park was so quiet, although there were still a few people walking there, but they were all as silent as me. Suddenly a few pairs of small birds flew onto the branches, chirping, as if representing us complaining; so the solemn air seemed to be stirred up by a small ripple.</p>
<p>——It's late autumn! Winter should be coming soon!</p>
<p>Autumn is like a senile old man, when it comes, it will make you realize that the fate of this year is about to end, but winter is even more like an old man suffering from third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis, waiting for his life to pass away.</p>
<p>Walking out of the park, I wandered aimlessly on the street, my heart was wandering like a stray bird that had lost its home, and I didn't understand where to go to be good.</p>
<h3>On the Levee</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Life in illness is lonely and solitary. Living in this unfamiliar and secluded countryside for three months, spending those difficult days feels as long as three years. Sometimes, as the sun sets, I slowly walk along the levee, watching the blood-red setting sun gradually swallowed by the heart of the river. I seem to wonder if I am living outside this world.</p>
<p>When I came to the countryside, it was when the cicadas were singing loudly into the clouds. In the blink of an eye, it has been three months. Listening to the sound of maple leaves and withered leaves rustling on the levee, I inexplicably feel that I have been forgotten by people in this corner.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in the countryside, having escaped from the noisy environment, every plant and tree here aroused my favor, as if the life I longed for was right in front of me. Autumn brings a slight illness, and some people have praised it in this way, so I should take advantage of this rare opportunity to enjoy everything that this slight illness has given me.</p>
<p>The residence is three bungalows, divided into bedrooms, studies, and living rooms. If I hung up some calligraphy and paintings and prepared some modern furniture, arranging them in a decent manner, and invited two or three close friends to chant a few poems and play a piece of music, I might feel that three months have passed too quickly. I only brought a few simple pieces of luggage with me, not enough to decorate a bedroom, so what I call the study and living room are really only nominally so. A month after I moved in, the neighbors started a major construction project, saying that they were specially building a new house for their son's wedding, so the two rooms were borrowed as workshops. The sound of hammering wood every day was so noisy that I couldn't take a nap, but chatting with the carpenters, they were as straightforward and innocent as children, which relieved the lonely years.</p>
<p>The bungalows face the long levee. If it were a building, you could open the window and lean on the window sill, watching the sun rise from the heart of the river in the morning, and looking forward to the returning sails of the fishing boats at night. The countryside has its own unique beauty. However, the houses are lined with maple trees in front, the owner's intention is to provide shade. When the sun is high in the sky, these three bungalows simply do not get any sun. If you want to read a book or take a nap, it is as quiet and suitable as can be. However, I don't want to lock myself in the house. The doctor also needs me to exercise more, so I love this long levee very much. I even fantasize about leveling this row of maple trees.</p>
<p>It is said that this long levee was built by turning over the mud from the bottom of the river. This mud is very fertile. Walking slowly on the levee is like stepping on light wild duck down. After a light rain, the levee seems to be attracting your footsteps, often slowly walking forward, forgetting the direction of your house. On one side, you watch the surging waves hitting the foot of the levee, and sometimes those water splashes hit your feet like a fountain, so you worry about falling down if you lose your footing, but it is something that will never happen. Even if you really fall into the river, taking a bath on the sand or soaking in the water for half a day would be of great benefit to our body. However, the villagers will not use this natural swimming pool, otherwise, this small town will be advertised like Moganshan and Qingdao when summer comes.</p>
<p>Every morning, I put on a large coolie hat, a large coolie hat that is wider than my shoulders, support myself with a cane, and walk eastward in slippers. Many times, I take the food I bring with me on the levee as lunch. Once, I accidentally found that a section of the levee had collapsed far away from the house. I sat there, dipping my bare feet into the heart of the river, letting the splashing waves wash my feet. After an unspeakable joy, I spent my lonely days there almost every day.</p>
<p>Now, autumn is deep. At noon, I still take a walk on the levee, but with continuous wind and rain, I stay in the house. Looking at the levee from the gaps between the trees, those beautiful waves and the dotted fishing boats no longer arouse my favor. Watching pieces of withered leaves fall from the treetops, swirling in the air with the merciless autumn wind, slowly falling into the heart of the river; it seems that I have also been forgotten by people in this corner.</p>
<p>The neighbor's building has been erected majestically on the bank of the levee. I can no longer find a comrade who can chat with me, so I picked up my luggage and said goodbye to the long levee.</p>
<h3>Harbor</h3>
<p>— Bei Hua</p>
<p>The water of the harbor flows quietly, and from a high place you would feel that it is a long and curved ribbon. It passes through the jungle, skims over the cedar bridge, and at the corner it whistles the tune of the southern grassland, flowing endlessly forward.</p>
<p>Near the depths of the jungle, the color of the harbor water loses its luster under the shade of the trees, yellowish, and sometimes it also permeates with dark green, which is probably because of the different depths of the water. Right here on the shore, there is a very large tree, its dense leaves covering the scorching sun. I like to sit here, listening to the music from the depths of the harbor; looking towards the other side of the harbor, there is an endless expanse of open fields. People's moods will completely change in front of this kind of scenery; I am very satisfied with life here, and I don't want to return to the embrace of the metropolis.</p>
<p>There is an elderly man, over sixty years old and in good health, who often walks past here, as if going somewhere. His back is slightly bent, his hair is almost completely white, and he has kept a tuft of beard; he often strokes it as he walks. If I stay here a little longer, I can also meet him walking back slowly. He has probably walked a lot of roads, he is panting, resting under this tree with fatigue, leaning his back against the trunk. I turn my head, and he greets me with a smile:</p>
<p>"Big kid, you're still here."</p>
<p>He calls me a big kid. This is very interesting, and I start to talk to him with a friendly attitude.</p>
<p>"Where are you coming from?" I ask.</p>
<p>"I go to the vegetable market every day; I see you on the way every day. Do you know Bangjia—he is my son, and he works as an assistant for someone in the vegetable market."</p>
<p>"Are you going to see him?"</p>
<p>"That's right. How can I not go see him? He is already twenty years old this year." As he speaks, he gradually becomes excited, forgetting his fatigue, and his eyes look at me as if in a trance. "His boss is already forty years old, but he has a young wife who has all the wisdom of a woman. She goes to the vegetable market every day with the reason that she is bored at home and cannot leave her man. She likes Bangjia, and she—this makes me feel like something unfortunate is about to happen, and I want Bangjia to give up that assistant job and come home."</p>
<p>He stopped here. But just as I was about to interject, he continued:</p>
<p>"Guess what Bangjia said? He said that if he quit that job, wouldn't he starve? We have a total of five people to feed. Yes, Bangjia can't be without work; and I'm so old that I'm just bones…"</p>
<p>After listening to so much, I still haven't understood the reason why the old man goes to see his son every day. But from the young boss's wife, it can be inferred that he is trying to prevent the woman from tempting Bangjia.</p>
<p>"Women can't be close to!" He finally said with the demeanor of a philosopher. "Sometimes she is a snake, tightly wrapping around you, not letting you be yourself. Sometimes she is a vampire, she sucks all the blood from your body, and then throws you away!"</p>
<p>I, the big kid, do not have the intelligence to understand his preaching, but I can see from his wrinkled, old face that he has received extremely profound lessons from women. His narrow, unbuttoned chest rose and fell. Then, as if he had thought of something, a trace of bitter smile appeared on his dry lips, and he fell silent.</p>
<p>The sunlight was as soft as cotton, pouring onto the green tobacco fields across the way; when the evening wind blew past, the tobacco seedlings were rolled into waves, which were very dazzling. I silently watched the green waves, the old man's breath and the sound of the harbor water were soft and clear. But dusk was already approaching.</p>
<p>When parting, he reached out and hammered his waist for a while, and then stood in front of me. "You don't understand my words, you don't understand…"</p>
<p>And then he walked away lonely…</p>
<p>At that time, I was deeply in love with a charming and lively girl, who had returned to Borneo because of her mother's illness. Thinking of the love under the coconut grove, the next day I took a boat, drifting from the harbor water towards home, waiting for a young man's dream…</p>
<h3>Eastbound Grass</h3>
<p>— Liu Bing</p>
<p>II. Food in Tokyo</p>
<p>Speaking of food, I think no country in the world is more frugal and simple than the Japanese. However, although they are frugal and simple, the nutrients contained in their food are more than in those expensive and troublesome feasts in our country.</p>
<p>Japanese people usually eat three meals a day. Breakfast is generally the same for every family, a small bowl of miso soup per person, and a few slices of yellow radish. If there is a little better side dish, that is a middle-class or above family. At the same time, they are very particular about politeness. Even if they are a family, when they put down their rice bowls, the children must say to their mother: "Thank you for giving me such a full breakfast," and the mother must politely reply: "Not at all, it's very coarse." As for lunch, most men and children do not eat at home because they are working or studying, and their mothers will prepare a "bento box" for them. (This is a square flat iron box about six inches long and four inches wide, with two or three compartments inside, which can hold rice, a few slices of vegetables, and a pair of chopsticks. At noon, they use the vegetables and rice inside to solve the problem of their stomachs. Dinner is a little more plentiful, but ordinary people still grill a few slices of fish, miso soup, and a few slices of radish. Chicken is only affordable for middle-class or above families.</p>
<p>They don't eat much pork, and beef was only eaten by some people in the Meiji era, and it is still not common now. What they love to eat most is fish. The types of fish are also very complicated, and the prices vary greatly. There is salmon that sells for two cents a large piece, and there is live trout transported by special plane from Lake Biwa, but small ones, three or four inches long, cost forty or fifty cents. This kind of fish is supplied to wealthy families for occasional use.</p>
<p>Because Japanese people eat things so simply, Chinese students studying in Japan feel that the most unpleasant thing is eating. Everyone still wants to eat Chinese food, but it is not easy to eat Chinese food in Tokyo. If you go to a Chinese restaurant to eat, the bad ones are still the same as Japanese food. The good ones are shockingly expensive. If you want to cook yourself, it is very difficult for one person, because Japanese people are willing to rent a room to Chinese people to live in, mostly because they are poor, so they take this opportunity to earn a few dollars. If you want to rent a house, you have to include meals, which costs no less than twenty or thirty yuan a month. Therefore, many students studying in Japan combine several people to live in a "rental house" outside Tokyo, owning a house by themselves, which makes cooking convenient. If you hire a maid, then all the clothes and cleaning can be solved. Fortunately, transportation in Tokyo is convenient, and students are treated especially well, so even if they live outside the city, it doesn't matter much.</p>
<p>When cooking for themselves, at first they still feel that there are no vegetables to eat, but after living there for a long time, they will naturally discover many good things that are cheap and good. For example, pork kidneys only sell for three cents each, and a whole set of pig liver only costs twenty cents, because these things are not eaten by Japanese people, only Chinese people buy them to eat. But these things are not easy to buy, you must first order them from the butcher shop the day before, and eating these things is looked down upon by the Japanese, so you must eat them secretly. There are also pig trotters, which are delicacies for us Chinese, but they cannot be found anywhere in Tokyo. If you want pig trotters, you have to go to Yokohama to buy them, so students studying in Japan who go to Yokohama will definitely bring some pig trotters back, the price of which is simply unbelievable in China. However, the Japanese have become smarter recently and have raised the price a lot.</p>
<p>Eating chicken also requires a little cleverness. Obviously, it is one chicken, but the price is different. Back meat is eight cents per two taels, but leg meat only costs four cents. In addition, there is a kind of milk chicken, which is especially delicious, and the price is not expensive. It is said that this is a by-product of the milk farm, and they usually eat milk, so its taste is also particularly different, but it is only sold in large department stores, and ordinary markets cannot buy it.</p>

<h3>New Song Introduction</h3>
<p>Love Under the Moon</p>
<p>Song from the Kuai Huo Lin's new film "Little Aunt"</p>
<p>The azure sky is like an overturned pot, looking back, how desolate, the bright moon hangs overhead, only feeling emptiness and loneliness. Sparkling light waves, a cold and pure scene, a desolate ten thousand miles, how suffocating, a solitary one! Oh, lamenting that a beautiful woman's life is thinner than smoke, tears are more than dew, hatred is wider than the sky, dreams are tempting, birds are nesting in soft nests, stars are laughing and joyous, may I ask, moon! You, you, you, are alone and reunited, do you also feel a little bit of happiness, happiness. My heart is burning like fire, and my spirit is so desolate! In chaotic times and years of famine, natural and man-made disasters never cease. Hasty youth, bitter and hard life, the Milky Way of ten thousand miles, would it allow this orphan to entrust himself to... Oh, it's really hard to endure the heart, exhausting this life, letting the rope bind me, flesh and blood are being slaughtered, the body is in a net, the spirit is being scorched, when will I be able to break free! Ask the little Chang'e, whose sin is this, after all?</p>
<p>Good Night</p>
<p>The setting sun on the vast edge, good night. The light breeze through the curtains, good night. Tomorrow will definitely be sunny, tonight we can sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>The bright moon in the sky, good night. The towering mountains across the ridge, good night. Tomorrow will definitely be peaceful, tonight will definitely be peaceful, tonight we can sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>The lonely traveler at the end of the world, good night. The lover across the sea, good night. Tomorrow will definitely be pleasant, tonight we can sleep peacefully. Friends all over the world, good night. The factory next door, good night. Tomorrow will definitely be bright, tonight we can sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>Parting Feelings</p>
<p>The whistle blows a long, drawn-out sound, the iron wheels roll on and on, leaving wisps of light smoke that stir the heart, let us gather on the terrace to express our parting feelings, farewell, farewell, departing people. Going away with the呜呜 sound of the whistle, I don't know when we will see each other again.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Hometown, take a look at her parents' home, meet her old friends she hasn't seen for many years, spend some good times of family reunion, I hope you don't just enjoy the beautiful dream of your hometown, but forget the me who misses you day and night, goodbye, goodbye, I'll wait for you to come back and tell me your parting feelings.</p>
<p>Renewing Old Affections</p>
<p>The night breeze has blown away the scorching heat of the sun, and a new crescent moon hangs high in the sky again. The mountains embrace each other with long arms, tightly hugging each other. Ah, today I see this familiar hometown again. Looking at the distant, swaying silver waves, it seems like a small boat is tossing, with two black shadows shoulder to shoulder, their collars overlapping, it vaguely resembles mandarin ducks spending the night by the lotus pond. Ah, dreamlike old affection, now it is renewed for me, an eternal chest! Ah! Today I see this familiar hometown again, and I can't help but shed tears and feel sad!</p>
<h3>A Collection of Telegrams</h3>
<p>Thank you for your kindness, "Copper Thunder Young Master," inviting me to your mansion (48 Penglai Market) for a feast. It is just that I have some matters and cannot accompany you as agreed; at the same time, I also have no face to eat this free meal. Moreover, if I come to your mansion, I am afraid that the "Young Master" will be so frightened that he will fall into the "coffee pot" (because my face is very ugly). But I think that there must be a grand situation in the sky, and I hope that the "Young Master" will lend me this place for a listening. Then, it will be enough to express your kindness. Wishing you happiness! (Iron Pen answers Copper Thunder)</p>
<p>Editor: Regarding the correction of the Mei Hua Music Association in your newspaper the other day, Liu Ma Yi, a leader of the old Mei Hua Music Association, shamelessly claimed in your newspaper that the association is indeed old and declared the association's great history. Since the association insists on using the name "Mei Hua", our association has no choice. Because our association is not registered with the Ministry of Industry of the Nanjing government, we cannot restrict them. We can only protect each other's personality. Since it is old, there is no need to add the word "old". If this word "old" is not added, then facts speak louder than words, and outsiders will definitely understand who is old and who is imitating. Moreover, before our association broadcasted, we had never heard of an old Mei Hua Music Association broadcasting in the air. Once our association has achieved considerable success in broadcasting, an old Mei Hua Music Association will appear. Isn't this also an interesting thing? Our association is entirely an amateur group, so it cannot be compared with those who rely on collecting a few shows to make a living. I also do not have the time to constantly submit letters to your newspaper for debate. This is also my last letter of clarification. Our association has broadcasted on the You Lian, Fu Xing, Hang Ye, Dong Lu, Hua Guang radio stations, the New World Disaster Relief Entertainment Fair, and the Qing Ping Singing Society, singing and accompanying the Mei Hua Music Association on stage for two days. Our association's history is that old, so please ask Liu Ma and the others to inquire at the radio stations? Our association does not intend to compete for the old brand or fake brand, but only wants the listeners who listen to our association's music not to be deceived by counterfeit goods. Li Hongshou, Leader of the Mei Hua Music Association</p>

<h3>Yi Hua Magazine</h3>
<p>— (Bai Yun)</p>
<p>Yi Hua established a drama troupe, rehearsing the "Death of a Famous Actor" very diligently these days.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new work, "Wedding Night," has decided to go to Nanjing at the end of this month to shoot outdoor scenes first.</p>
<p>People generally expect that Ying Yunwei's "Hero of the Hour" will breathe a sigh of relief into the sluggish Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Guo Bolin is scheduled to take "Hero of the Hour" and "Triumphant Song" to Japan for screening in mid-next month.</p>
<p>"Triumphant Song"—not only does Xia Wan Cang himself attach importance to it, but the general public also values it very much.</p>
<p>Yesterday, "Triumphant Song" filmed a scene at the Dragon King Temple. The grandeur of the scene, the excitement of the situation, the large number of actors, and the tense atmosphere truly opened a new era for national films.</p>
<p>The performances of the two old men, Qin Tong and Wang Guilin, in "Triumphant Song" are truly "very hard".</p>
<p>Fang Peilin has been very busy designing the scenery for "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" these days.</p>
<p>"Look! This world is the world of home," Shang Guanwu once said in "Hero of the Hour." Ah! Whose world is this after all?</p>
<p>"Hero of the Hour" can be released at the end of January.</p>
<h3>Lianhua News</h3>
<p>A pioneer in the film industry, Wang Hanlun, had a brilliant history in the past. Now, it has been several years since she left the film industry. After such a long separation, how do her vast audiences miss her!</p>
<p>This is certainly welcome news. She is now back in the film industry. "Weeping Tears of Red," written by Zhu Shilin and directed by Wang Cilong, is her first work upon returning to the screen.</p>
<p>Next to the National Games venue, Lianhua rented eleven rooms and closed them off as the Lianhua Pavilion, displaying the achievements of Lianhua's predecessors, the situation of the films, and educational supplies, so that visitors not only have a considerable understanding of Lianhua, but also have a considerable understanding of the entire film production process. Therefore, the number of visitors has been endless recently, and athletes often come in and out of it. Lianhua has also specially assigned several staff members to be responsible for reception and management.</p>
<p>Lianhua Books and Newspapers has a history of more than three years. Since its publication, it has been enthusiastically welcomed by the audience. Therefore, there has been a progressive reform in the past. Now, in Volume 6, Issue 8, there is a fourth reform. The cover uses a color plate, and the copperplate drawing also adds a two-color plate on one page. The text is printed on Daolin paper, eight pages in total, with a total thickness of forty pages. The price is changed to one corner per copy, which is extremely novel and pleasing to the eye, and has now been published.</p>
<p>After "National Customs", Luo Mingyou and Zhu Shi co-directed the new work "Song of a Loving Mother" again, which is a full-length sound dialogue film. The classroom scene has now been filmed, and young stars Li Keng, Ge Zuo Zhi, Chen Juan Juan, and others are fully on stage. Huang Yunzhen plays a female professor. This scene is performed extremely vividly and interestingly.</p>
<p>The photography team that set off to Qingdao "to go to nature" has already returned. A test screening of the films taken a few days ago shows that the beauty of the scenery is so breathtaking that people feel refreshed and as if they are bathing in the natural world.</p>
<p>There is a small bridge in "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River," about a foot and a half long and less than a foot high. However, when people stand on the bridge, the people are smaller than the bridge. The skills of this set design are truly mysterious.</p>
<p>The two gentlemen, Dan Ganting and Fan Quanbo, from the general distribution department of Lianhua, are called "Egg Fried Rice" by Han Lan Gen.</p>
<p>In the midst of arduous struggles, the Lianhua General Production Factory has built two photography studios one after another, forming a three-legged situation with the original one.</p>
<p>Sun Yu, Chen Yanyan, Li Lili, Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, and others went to the National Games venue and were surrounded by people asking for autographs and inscriptions. Shanghai athlete Ms. Li Sen broke the national record in the 50-meter sprint. Sun Yu went to shake hands and congratulate her.</p>
<p>The location shooting team for "Waves Washing Sand" is still in Qingdao. Wu Yonggang, Hong Weilie, Jin Yan, Zhang Zhizhi, and others work on the beach island every day, which is quite like explorers.</p>
<p>Li Lili is good at archery, which few people know. Recently, she showed off her skills in "To Go to Nature." Sun Yu joked, "In ancient times there was Huang Zhong, now there is Lili."</p>
<p>Ge Zuo Zhi's style in "The Lost Lamb" is completely different from his previous works such as "Black Heart Amulet" and "Little Angel". The Ge Zuo Zhi we see in this film is truly a naughty child.</p>
<p>Heng Fu, who is known as an important person in the photography studio, is nicknamed "Little Ningbo." He has a Pascal-like cold face and his movements are very funny. He has now been selected for an important role in "Three Modern Men."</p>
<p>The village street scene for "Weeping Tears of Red" is being set up and will be filmed in the next few days. Director Wang Cilong has been galloping through the film studio in a very busy state these days.</p>
<p>After "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp," Tan Youliu is devoting all his efforts to the writing of his new script. It is said that it will be completed in a few days.</p>
<p>The three major photography studios in the Lianhua General Factory stand tall and are exceptionally magnificent. After completion, the work of filming can be accelerated several times.</p>
<p>The Lianhua General Factory has a completely new and vibrant atmosphere.</p>
<p>The word "Tian Lun" (Family Ethics) has a very deep impression in the minds of audiences across the country. This film will be released soon.</p>
<p>After the return of the Putuo photography team for "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River", they immediately rushed to shoot the interior scenes. The entire film can be completed in a few days. Director Ma Xuweibang said to people, "It took much more effort to shoot this film than when shooting 'Storm of Pear Blossoms', and Ms. Chen Yanyan's performance was also more demanding than in 'Storm of Pear Blossoms'."</p>
<p>Shang Guanwu's acting skills have improved surprisingly. "Tian Lun" has extremely high achievements. Wang Cilong's "Weeping Tears of Red" has been decided to be starred by him.</p>
<h3>Heroes and Beauties in Xinhua's New Film "Hero of the Hour"</h3>
<h3>Silhouette of "Moon Bends"</h3>
<p>The large water set scene in "Moon Bends" is very realistic and is the result of the hard work of the set department of the Star Company.</p>
<p>Wu Zhu, the daughter of Haozi Wu Village, is eleven years old, lively and innocent, and is a charming little bird. She plays the role of Xue'er in "Moon Bends" and is also one of the leading actors.</p>
<p>There are more than seventy actors in the entire cast of "Moon Bends," of which more than thirty are disaster victims.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhen plays the role of the noblewoman Yingyu in "Moon Bends," so Zhu has been ordering many new clothes recently.</p>
<p>In "Moon Bends," Hu Die is also one of the disaster victims, living on pancakes every day. It is expected that after the five-act play is completed, Hu Die will have eaten half a dozen pancakes.</p>
<p>Old Gao (Zhan Fei) also made two sets of Western-style clothes in order to play in "Moon Bends."</p>
<p>The sound effects in "Moon Bends" are designed by Wu Village, such as the sound of a flood breaking out, a house collapsing, and a car injuring people.</p>
