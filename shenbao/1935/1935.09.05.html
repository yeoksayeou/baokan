<p>（日內瓦）各國對於行政院本屆會議程序、聞已商定辦法行政院首先當舉行非公開會議、然後舉行公開會議、屆時當由英國不管部大臣艾登對於巴黎會議經過提出報吿書、法國國務總理兼外長賴伐爾對於報吿書詞旨、當加以贊助、其次再由意國代表阿洛錫說明意國主張、最後乃由阿國代表發表意見、凡此係屬形式問題、至意阿爭端內容、則在本日會議中未必加以討論也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）此數日內此間情緒極度緊張、今日聞讓與權行將取銷、故悄緒卽吿弛緩、一般人希望、此一表示後、可使外交談話之空氣爲之澄淸、今晨艾登與賴伐爾曾作長談、其所着重之問題、卽英法關於三國會議流產一事、究應一方單獨提出、或聯合提出、今日會議是否公開亦極可疑、今午秘密會議起自下午四時、恐將延長下去、公開究覓能否立卽開幕、亦將視秘密會議之久暫爲轉移、（四日國民電）</p>

<h3>仲裁委員會　决議不落邊際　認華爾華爾衝突事件　意阿雙方均不能尸</h3>
<p>（巴黎）意阿仲裁與調解委員會因國聯行政院曾於八月三日决議委員會之任務、不得涉及華爾華爾主權問題、此實使委員會不能依法判决是非、聞委員會因是乃作出人不意之和緩而不落邊際的决議、卽華爾華爾衝突案與後此一切事端、意阿兩方皆不負任何道德上或金錢上之責任是、委員會曾决計以查明事實爲根據、而處理該問題、但自第一案發生至今已閱九月、調查當日眞相、殊非易事、且意人在華爾華爾之行動、乃屬殖民性的、阿人則屬國家性的、雙方性質不同、故不能歸咎於任何一方、法國視委員會之决議已撥除天空之陰霾、而使意阿問題易獲和平之解决、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>美孚公司　允放棄採油權　因受國務院之干涉　阿國聞訉大為失望</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）阿比西尼亞國煤油讓與權、係由菲洲拓殖銀公司取獲、該銀公司乃係美孚媒油公司之附庸、該公司對於此項讓與權、頃應國務卿赫爾個人之請、决定予以放棄、赫爾當宣稱、「美國政府對於此項讓與權甚覺爲難、卽他國政府凡竭誠維護和平者、實亦窮於應付、茲美孚公司旣允予以放棄、自屬善事」云、此事經過悄形有可得而言者、美孚煤油公司董事長華爾頓副董事長鄧達斯曾晋謁國務卿赫爾、吿以阿國煤油讓與權確係該公司所獲得、旋幷與國務院近東司司長慕雷相會晤嗣又晋見赫爾、赫爾當聲明此項　與權在目今情形之下、係屬維持和平之大障礙、幷可發生嚴重影響、華爾頓與鄧達斯爰乃遄回紐約、與該公司重要股東曾商、幷用電話通知國務院、謂願放棄此項讓與權、至關於赫爾與華爾頓鄧達斯會晤悄形、頃由公報予以發表、據云華爾頓曾向國務卿赫爾說明美孚公司對於阿國煤礦自二十年以來甚爲關切曾迭次進行不懈、迨至本年初李凱特在倫敦時又以取獲讓與權之可能性、通知該公司主管人員、幷與之從長計議、該公司爰乃獨力組織「菲洲拓殖銀公司」、準備開始經營、該公司幷於上星期五日接獲電報、謂已取獲讓與權、特合同全文尙未寄到、而該公司亦未以欽項繳付阿國政府耳云云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）菲洲拓殖公司所獲開採阿國油礦七十五年之讓與權、因　務院之干涉、行將取消、國務院總理在過去數日內研究因此讓與權而起之難題、及日內瓦等處所將發生之反響、今日聲稱、此項讓與權頃予註銷赫爾吿新聞記者、渠與美孚油公司職員討論後、該公司允放棄此讓與權庶便取消赫爾又稱、菲洲拓殖公司之獲有讓與權、决不能變更美國對意阿局勢之態度此項交易無論在商業上或政治上有何性質、惟美政府對意阿爭議之政策、今後仍如舊貫此項讓與權之談判、美政府絕無所知云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　阿政府某員聲稱、美國取銷李支特所獲讓與權之消息、令人大爲失望、受讓者在合同簽字未滿一週後而能取銷此權、殊令人不解、聞合同中並無取銷之規定、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>戰雲籠罩之東菲形勢　圖中——為由意通阿之海道</p>
<h3>阿國政府發表聲明</h3>
<p>油讓與權有助於富源開發　一九零六年條約不受拘束</p>
<p>阿京　阿比西尼亞政府頃發表公報、對於李凱特媒油讓與權一事有所聲明、謂「阿比西尼亞政府給予開採煤油礦之讓與權完全係根據阿國獨立主權而行事、此項讓與權純屬經濟性質、有助於阿國富源之開發、抑阿　政府之政策、始終出以忠誠態度、志在延攬各國專門家金融家以開發廣大之國土、此種政第旣屬大公無私、故阿國政府决不加以變更」云、述及外間所傳此舉違反一九零六年三國條約一節、則　「阿比西尼亞政府並未簽字於一九零六年條約、故不受其拘束、此層曾於一九二六年八月七日阿國政府致當時國聯會秘書長德魯蒙之公函中、加以聲明、一九零六年條約雖劃定意國勢力範圑、且經英國加以承認然阿國對於此項决定、並不受其約束且一九零六年條約規定簽約國擔保阿比西尼亞之領十完整、今意國公然破壞此種諾言、則此項條約實已失其效力、至於英國政府則與此項讓與權毫無關係、因其純屬　國資本故也」云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>阿駐英公使之表示</h3>
<p>（倫敦）阿比西尼亞駐英公使馬爾丁博士、本日在尼羅河協會發表演說、略謂「今如能與吾人以二十年之和平、畀吾人以二千萬鎊之借欵、用以在阿國各地興辦學校、開發富源、則余敢擔保阿國文明、必不在他國之下、且意大利之勞苦大衆、其有需於解放、尤甚於阿國之奴隸、蓋阿國奴隸今可自由發表意見、苟遭主人虐待、則可要求懲治其主人、而意國勞苦大衆則不然也、至於意國殖民地受阿國威脅、尤屬無稽讕言、英法兩國始終尊重吾人之獨立與領土完整、獨意國則輒圖蠶食阿國領土、事實俱在、無待明辯、阿國法律對於工商業讓於權不分國別、平等待過、意大利籍僑民曾有阿國獲得開採金礦之重要讓與權、卽　明證也、」馬爾丁博士最後相信、如意阿一旦發生戰爭、阿國可以獨力獲得勝利彼殊不願他國牽入戰爭漩渦云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英在國聯將受打擊</h3>
<p>英政府令駐使詳細探詢　反對黨將挾爲攻擊工具</p>
<p>（倫敦）消息靈通人士相信政府已以下列二事、訓令駐阿比西尼亞公使巴登爵士、（一）親向阿皇探詢石油礦讓與權資本總額及其投資人名、（二）促使阿皇注意此項讓與權之簽訂、對於阿國在日內瓦之地位有所不利、則以此項讓與權簽訂後、在經濟基礎上、與意國成立妥協、將益見困難也、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）政界人士認爲李凱特煤油讓與權事件、對於英國在日內瓦所提出之主張、係一認眞之打擊、蓋英國要求倘遇國聯會盟約遭侵犯時、應援引盟約第十六條實施制裁、今有李凱特讓與權、則此種制裁是否尙能提出、殊成一疑問矣、一般人以爲阿國皇帝倘不能停止此項讓與權之效力、則英國在　聯會或將不再取强硬態度、又英國政府對於李凱特讓與權、事前一無所知、此層雖屬可信、然在下屆總選舉時、反對黨必挾此事以作攻擊政府之武器、使政府　以置辯、此則政界人士亦未能加　諱飾也、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據金融界人士觀察、英國財圑當與李凱特煤油讓與權無關係、財政部倘繼續澈底調查、必能查明、此項讓與權有英國私人投資在內、惟殷東姓名則所未悉、金融界人士又謂中央金礦公司倘非全部投資於此項讓與權、至少當有一部份股份在內、此外倫敦銀行界接紐約力面報吿、極堪注意、此項報吿內謂菲洲拓植公司（卽與阿比西尼亞政府訂約獲得煤油讓與權者）之創辦人、韋斯魯伯與勃里頓兩人、郎係福德農公司董事、而福德農總公司　設在倫敦、似此則此項投資與倫敦方面有關、當無疑義、又有人謂菲洲拓植公司、本係專事吸收歐洲資本、而在美國註册營業者、此類傳說雖未必能削减英國政府之信用、但英國官方則已因此更爲不安矣（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>阿與美商訂立草約</h3>
<p>出讓金礦權交換借欵　此事與美孚公司無涉</p>
<p>（紐約）美國商人邱篤克今日聲稱、彼曾與　氏西及亞駐英公使馬丁訂立草約、自七月十九日起於九十日內、如能代阿籌得借欵美金一百萬元、則　國當以境內黃金白金及其他礦產之　產權讓與邱氏、以五十年爲期、邱氏謂彼對於債欵、已有相當之來源、故擬履行此項草約、財圑之名稱、邱氏雖不允發表、惟稱頗爲知名、同時並切實聲明與美孚火油公司毫無關係、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿皇任命米克爾爲科羅總督、並爲該地駐軍統監、米氏於七月底曾在爰里特里邊境徵募軍隊一萬二千人、今仍奉命繼續增募此項軍隊奉命在沿鐵路各站暫駐、故數日後卽有軍隊一萬六千人可資調遣、所有此項軍隊將在華爾華爾集中、其中一部份配製機關槍及高射砲、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞京城　此間兵士一千人於今晨開往華爾華爾、事前對於開拔時間前往地點均守秘密、兵士咸服白色制服、荷槍、手持獸皮所製之盾腰携子彈、出發前、歡送者列隊長至半公里、婦女兒童均往送行、迨兵士遠離後、始揮淚哭泣、按日前開往華　華爾者、已有兵士一萬人、明日尙有兵士繼續開拔、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿京　達那基爾部洛人民現仍絡繹逃至狄里達華附近之各村莊、羅馬方而雖竭力否認意軍已越伊里特里邊界而入阿境之說、但此項謠言仍盛傳各處狄里達華人心頗爲震動、現有許多居民移往法屬索瑪里倫之吉波蒂、各處人民之熱心戰事者、無蒂格里境若、該地有寒育姆者、統率大軍十五萬至二十萬人之間、塞育姆之婦、貌美而勇、良人他適時、輒代統軍、他日意阿如果興戎則渠擬赴前線盡役、塞育姆現準偏烽火、自前線起、達陣後一百五十哩之遙、敵至之時舉火示警</p>

<h3>意使否認　軍隊侵入阿境　阿京意僑紛紛他徒</h3>

<p>（東京）非　時之新陸相川島義之大將、與西東京警備司令官植田朝鮮軍司令官係同　生、同爲陸大第十期生、比較林陸相後二期、在陸大時爲優等軍刀組、大將自靑年士官時代以來之職務、關係作戰與資材、故為不甚注目之事務、惟爲人樸實、雖不甚有名而無彩色、若有大事發生、則　埋頭苦幹之人物、自更迭敎育總監定斯異　及永田事件發生後、一時尖銳化之部內空氣、竟突歸平穩、而非正式軍　參議官會議及軍司令官師圑長會議之能若是進行要由林陸相之獻身的努力、一方亦由川島大將之廢寢忘餐、幹旋於各巨頭之故　林陸相在師圑長會議之訓示、得軍首腦部意見之一致、亦經渠多大之努力、有以致之、川島大將之政治手腕、於此可見一斑、惟大將係無色透明、其眞價並不澈底、故暫時恐頗費力、大將係愛媛人除飮酒外別無嗜好、（四日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）一股對於川島大將之就任陸相、意謂今格之政局上或不無影響、至爲注目、其實以新陸相之手腕强化陸軍之統制、一致向肅軍工作邁進當可得到相當之實績、政府方面均期待於川島新陸相者也、但川島大將對於國體明徵問題、傳聞頗抱有相當强硬意見、故對於此點、政府究可獲得何種程度之協調、似不無懸念、又於今後展開之陸軍預算編制時新陸相與財政當局之折衝、究表示若何態度、亦爲吾人所注目之處、唯政府首腦部之意向、以爲國體明徵問題、政府固應繼續努力於今後、乃爲事理之當然、卽於明年度預算編制之際、承認其必須之經費亦不待言、且觀察現在國際情勢及滿洲方面之現狀、均對於陸軍預算按事分配、是以川島新陸相之就任、當不致發生特別變化也云、（四日日聯電）</p>

<h3>廣東銀行　滬分行昨停業　香港總行電告改組　改組期內暫停支付</h3>
<p>本市寗波路廣東銀行上海分行、於昨晨九時四十五分、宣吿暫行停業、該行爲銀行公會會員、總行設於香港、向英國政府註册、其停業原因、　因受總行週轉不靈停業之影響、各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>總行歷史　廣東銀行、於民國元年、依香港政府有限公司則例註冊成立、以香港爲總行、最初由陸蓬山集美洲華僑資本、會同港商李煌堂、共商籌辦一華資銀行、專營銀行一切業務、各界人士、認股甚爲踴躍、該行遂吿成立、其資本不過港幣二百萬元、至民國十年、改爲英金一百二十萬鎊、迨民十五年、復改爲港幣一千一百萬元、純粹華資、該行除在上海·廣州·漢口·暹羅·設有分行外、復在舊金山·紐約·倫敦·設有分行、並悉該行董事會主席李煌堂·董事陸蓬山·李自重·鍾錫蕃、李文啟·李景衢·譚煥堂·羅旭和·陳符祥·黃茂林·李葆葵·李亦梅·伍子翰·李炳超·伍耀庭·總司理陸蓬山·該行前曾呈准英國政府發行鈔票、旋以準備金方面須十足繳呈英國當局保存、致無利可圖、遂逐漸收回、迄於絕跡、此乃五年前之事也、</p>

<p>滬行情形　上海分行成立於民國五年、先設於四川路寗波路口、（卽現通和銀行原址）由黃朝章任經理繼、任者爲王雲衢·最近之經理爲張榮溥·聞該行資本大約一百數十萬元、存戶約一百數十餘萬元、去年落成之新厦乃係香港總行撥欵建築者、</p>
<p>林康侯談　據銀行公會秘書林康侯談、該行雖爲銀行公會會員、民十三年入會、曾向實業部登記、因其總行向英國註册、同業中曾一度異議、不幸今竟停業、其說細情形、以倉猝發生、尙未　悉、事先銀行公會亦未曾接得該行通知云、據金融界消息、廣東銀行上海分行雖屬停業、其本身方面、並無特殊虧損、存戶方面、皆係本埠一部份廣東同鄉、至同業票據往來方面、聞爲數亦甚有限云、</p>
<p>退出交換　上海聯合準備委員會票攘交換所通吿第四十四號、准第二十三號交換銀行廣東銀行函稱、因接香港電令、暫停營業、卽日起、暫時退出票據交換等由、該行旣已停業、所請暫時退出交換一節、自應卽日起發生效力、除陳報執行委員會並通吿各行查照外、特此通吿、</p>
<p>財政部令　財政部昨聞該行停業後、卽令上海銀行業同業公會云、本日廣東銀行爲受該香港總行影響、業已停閉、該行雖未呈經本部註冊、但爲該會會員銀行、已歷有年數、故本埠各業與之頗有往來、本部爲保障本埠債權人利益安定市面起見、合亟令仰該公會、迅卽查明該行資負實况、飭其立刻將所有資產、繳存該公會、不得絲毫移動隱匿、並立卽分別發現、以爲淸償本埠債務之用、不得稍有違誤、並仰轉電漢口銀行公會、一例辦理、此令、（以上中央社）</p>

<h3>小男兒（卅六）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>裴先生笑了，却又搖着他的頭。</p>
<p>「我現在有個較好的法子：我曾經試過一次，頗有效騐。你聽，假如你說了謊，我不來罰你，但是擬卻須罰我。」</p>
<p>乃德聽了這個希奇的章思，嚇了一跳，便問道，怎麼樣呢？</p>
<p>「你須照那種老舊的方式重重地扑擊我；我自己卻也難得做的，可是給我痛苦比起你自己覺得痛苦，可以使你更加牢記些。」</p>
<p>「打！你呀，我不能的！」乃德呌道。</p>
<p>「那末留心你那個顚顚倒倒的舌頭。我　然不想計得苦　吃，然而爲得救你那種毛病，我寗可忍着痛苦。」</p>
<p>這個提議使乃德這麼感動，從此他久久慎防他的口唇，竭力要　眞切，絲毫也不苟且；裴先生判斷得真不錯，乃德愛他的動念强於爲他自己的怕懼。可是眞不幸！一天乃德又失檢了，因此當烈性子的愛彌來凶凶向他問罪，說如果踏倒他園裏頂好的一堆粟米的是乃德，他就要狠狠打他一頓子，乃德聲明不是他，他不敢自承昨夜爲解客窮追時他確曾跑過愛彌的圍地的。</p>

<h3>證劵　公債又在盤旋過程中　漲跌祗五分一角</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市面仍極和平、無甚參差、中間因廣東銀行之倒閉、曾因拋空踴躍、略形鬆退、但旋即安定、蓋以廣東銀行、完全係港匯關係、市面上關係尙淺、且已搖動多時、昨始不克維持、公債市塲、幾幾不關休戚、市上買戶、並不减於賣戶、四十八號又復踴躍買進、祗以交易寥寥、升降乃亦有限、九六因四號又有需要、稍稍轉堅、前途控仍將盤旋、昨日經過、上午開滬、繼續上漲五分一角至二角、交易不多、次盤因廣東銀行倒閉之關係、賣氣驟湧、六十五及七十六號等賣出爲多、市價回小二三角左右、午後開滬、十六及四十八號買進爲多、市况復又轉緊、微好一二角、收盤稍見混沌、交易甚淸、高低互見、祗五分一角、總計市價結果、高低互見、但祇九分一角居多數、成交總數、共計七百八十八萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花　籌碼減削　棉紗抵空上漲</h3>
<p>紗市穩堅、漲風微起、但現紗銷塲因秋節迫近、而轉沉寂、人心尙屬平常、惟標紗因倉庫中存漸減、有一部份空頭活動抵補、檯面較緊、本份獨挺、遠月亦被其激動矣、</p>
<p>本月紗激漲一元七標紗前市開盤、各月繼續上挺、局勢尚佳、塲中新賣戶缺乏、　面尤緊、二盤仍前進、拍至三盤、傳廣東銀行業已擱淺停業、賣風略起、忽落三四角、迨盤復形回昇、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二三四六角，午後開盤、本月份獨挺、且漲氣尤足、謂浮戶抵空、大阪三品紗連跌多日、反動回漲一二元、又說紗布　房存紗僅剩二三千包、本月份交貨不多、人氣一時轟動、忽跳一元、二三盤步步上提、遠期牽動而高、但現紗交易不暢、結果本月比七午收滬價漲一元半、遠漲六七八九角、查賣出裕康四百五十包、裕大五百五十包、大豐五百五十包、合興八百五十包、愼晶一千二百包、慎記二千一百五十包、潤康六百五十包、信誠八百五十包、德記四百包、瑞大四百包、買進同孚一千一百五十包、錦昌四百五十包、振大六百包、瑞大一千〇五十包、益昶四百五十包、永昌四百包、賡豐五百五十包、，長豐八百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>雨量過度棉花看好</h3>
<p>棉市頗堅、因天氣不正、據市塲言、鄭州陜西區、降雨仍大、目前新棉絮苞正在開放之際、候極關重要、所以人心傾向多頭、市塲情勢益、但各路新花紛紛上市云、</p>
<p>鄭標叵漲一角半</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月市態依然強硬、且賣者不多、因各方產區均有雨量過度之報吿、於是人心多數看好、准美棉狀况、仍舊萎疲無勁、本埠形勢甚挺、結果各月均比上日收盤價漲五分至一角、午後開盤聞大阪三品棉花上漲數角、預料明日美花有看漲可能性、故漲風益盛、迨至收月比上千收盤價均漲五分之一角半、查賣出大孚二千七百担、裕大一千担、合興一千七百担、愼昌一千五百担、森康九百担、泰昌一千一百祖、益康三千一百担、長和八百担、源大七百担、買進吉豐一千六百担、大望四千九百担、穗隆一千担、永昌一千四百担、源興昌二千四百担、達記二千二百担、愼記一千二百担、永大一千担、一日間最高低價及收滬價列下、</p>

<h3>借欵計劃未有新發展　美棉農套賣仍稀少</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲跌一二磅音、交易呆滯、上落平淡、同業及利物浦貿進、空戶抵補、其後南方賣出、多頭了結、股市不振、借欵計劃未有新發展、市價回軟、惟棉農　賣稀少、弗洛立太州四週有風潮、塲中微覺不寗、然西鐵克塞斯州之大肖、認爲有益、現需淸淡、紡織品市况堅定、收盤平、　現貨不動、期貨跌二至八磅音、英棉現貨漲一點、期貨跌一點、印棉歐洲出口商略有買進、計平果兩漲一羅比、奧姆辣跌半羅比、白織溪漲一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（三日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　東新粳上漲二角　新尖繼跳尺半</h3>
<p>本米昨日滬南各帮來源共到二十一二號（貨共四千餘石）、本街較平、靑島帮辦四百餘包、故形勢雖帶緊、而市色無豪氣、天時似陰似晴、對於破　需要、意態模稜，乃再遭新粳價廉、各破粳及薄稻行情、遂難激增、僅能略爲帶秀、各新粳本視天時爲轉移、今處此良機、步步活躍、價再升漲二角、其若新昌廠南橋李正興貨、竟盤開九元、並洋川等各色新尖、悉皆栗落、滬北昨日河下各帮來源廿六七號、市上各貨去胃、白粳平淡、市價疲數分、白元零胃轉懈、市形高貨小一二角、中次疲近角、薄稻平疲、東新粳到少獨活、便漲起二角、新羊尖到續有去路、高料尙可、中次呆滯、市價高定、中次疲角許、圑尖到百餘石、零拆頗活、價形挺立、新客尖到雖無多、零銷續動、市形定立、其餘各貨略帶軟勢、</p>
<h3>西貢米猶在抬價</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、升沉不一、洋米以存底日薄、後定不划、且產地受歐菲風雲影響、西貢米產價步升、故貨主一致保守、市價隨見突漲角許、小絞暹邏各米亦爲跟俏、但不及西貢之緊俏、客秈有甬早續到、甬米略見軟象、江西蕪湖各米均居定局、廣東新機米已售開五百包、價爲九元八角半、甬米共開六百零四包、贛蕪共計三百包、洋米統計成交三千六百包、大部份仍由本街辦進、北幫內地散戶仍有應酬云、</p>
<h3>期粉麥微露生氣　—亦帶着意阿戰爭影響—</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市微呈生氣、以洋麥報價、雖仍上落無幾、如芝加哥好一角零、坎拿大小四分至一角零、市塲人心、淸淡之情、彷彿史甚、惟以出戶甚稀、內地帮頗有吸進、故開價微見昂挺、迨至下午各滬、交易仍未見旺、不過市氣則又轉挺、因謠傳意阿接觸之空氣甚盛、是以業外又有買進、然數量不豐、爲沉　　中之點綴耳、結果本月份較漲一分、十月份漲一分、十一月份漲二分七釐半、十二月月份漲一分云、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午各盤、交易均建清淡、價則微穩、以業內外買賣雙方一致觀望居多、故市氣始終平靜、迨至下午開盤、因粉市見穩、且現麥因貨客扳持、喊價微挺、故各盤交易較暢、價亦續穩、觀後步如有意外風波、市面或有轉機之望也、結果九月份至十二月份各較好二分、現麥市面、因客戶不願多開、見交不多、各檔喊價已提一分、開出山東麥三元六角二分、明光麥三元六角一分、瑤　麥三元六角、崇明麥三元五角二分、由信大辦去二千包云、</p>
<h3>新豆紅糧一致轉漲</h3>
<p>昨日新黃豆轉漲四五分、因疲憊日久、販運束手、來源乃减、去路不斷、故經貨主扳緊、即見升漲、紅糧亦然、轉漲一角外、銷路頗暢、乃日本洋行辦進、昨市江北陳糧已開二元四角七分、成交一千五百餘包、新糧一千四百餘包、價爲二元六角半·六角四、崇明新糧三四百包、價自三元五角至四角三、</p>

<h3>油市　白桐油價扶搖直上</h3>
<p>白桐油自足度貨缺乏以來、漢口市面一漲漲、上週已加至每擔五十二元五角、但洋行羅不已、昨晚本埠號家接有漢電、謂售洋莊已飛提五十五元、洋行依然不以價高稍懈其進行、浙桐油足度貨竟已吿馨、欠度之油尚每租售五十一二元、亦自有市塲以來所未有、以各方觀察、則漢市洋莊可售至六十元、</p>

<h3>水災游藝會中之八幅流氓圖</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>本市各界所組之籌賑水災游藝大會，開幕以來，瞬已旬餘，該會為喚醒同胞捐欵救濟起見，在各游藝塲內，遍貼各種驚心觸目之揷畫標語，慘不忍覩，轉錄如下，希望閱報諸君，慷慨解囊，實行本報近來所登「救災卽救命，多捐一文錢，多救一條命」之廣吿：（一）畫兩隻碗，上一碗滿裝一隻全鴨，下一碗僅有麫條少些，題曰：『富人一餐飯，災民半月糧」其實富人所食，珍饈海味，日有十餘樣，災民欲求麫條半碗而不得，所謂一餐飯與半月糧，尙不能描摹盡致也。（二）上繪高矗雲之之洋房，堂皇富麗，下晝沒於水內之草棚，僅露屋頂，題曰：「住在都市的人們，勿忘了浸沉在澤國的同胞。一事實上住洋房者，家用奢侈外，尙欲嫖堂子走跳舞塲以耗費無謂之金錢，住草棚者，屋被水浸，難以安居，欲求果腹而不得，同在地球之上，不啻天堂與地獄之別。（三）繪一片汪洋中，有人兩手伸出水面，而在大呼救命，題日：「日浸在水裏的災胞，飢不得食，叫喊無應，同是黃帝的子孫，可能目覩其死麽？一（四）畫酒瓶與鮮肉各一，並置桌上，題曰：「少飲一杯酒，少吃一塊肉，可以多救一個人，一條命。（五）一人骨瘦如柴，坐於高阜，雙目注視水面，樹梢屋頂隱約可辨，上似有人棲止，題曰：「廬舍漂沒，人畜橫流，倖存的同胞，期望我們去救呀」！（六）繪香烟繚繞，紅燭高燒之高桌，題曰：「救濟災民，勝過燒香拜佛。」（七）繪一片汪洋，僅露山頂於水面，人畜在水上飄流者，不計其數，題曰：「大堤潰决，平原盡成澤國。」（八）畫有城墻，已被水沒去三分之二，僅見雉堞，題曰：一城地屋宇，盡付狂流，哀哀我民，亟待援手。」游人見之，莫不嗟歎，足徵惻隱之心，人皆有之也。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十八回　戚黨高攀逢迎斥小吏雌威大作嘈雜惱夫人</p>
<p>當自己第五次走到前面，由樓下經過的時候，却聽到藍專員在樓上大喊道：那件事究竟辦了沒有，我不能等了。這樣幾句平常的話，別人聽了或者沒事。然而介夫聽到，却只管心裏亂跳，立刻溜到樓角下靜靜的聽着。彷彿聽到有人說話，這事已經是辦完了。介夫這才把一身冷汗摸乾了。心裏想着，這糟透了，我簡直弄得草木皆兵。這標語不撕下來，我是坐立不安，管他有人無人，我就動手了。心一橫，奔到牆上的標語下去，就要抬起手來撕着。却聽到身後連連有人咳嗽了兩聲。介夫大吃一驚，那手立刻縮了回來。可是回轉頭看時，人家一行四五個，卻是由後面向前面行去的旅客。他們是坦然的走着，似乎不曾注意到誰人身上來。但是經過了這個打擊，那要抬起來的手，不敢冒昧抬出。只好背了兩手在大聽裏來回的踱着。這時，却聽到有一種吟吟的哭聲，只管向耳朶裏送了來。而且那聲音吟吟不斷，不像是突然有什麼感觸，分明是很傷心的，繼續哭了來的。於是站定了，靜靜的聽下去。這一捉摸，更是可怪，聲音乃是由賈多才屋子裏裏發生出來的。因之悄悄的走到那房門口去，却見門簾子垂下來，窗戶也關閉着。裏面雖也有燈，火光却不甚大。那吟吟的哭聲，依然繼續的發出。（三〇八）</p>
<h3>金魚漫話</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>珍珠—簡稱珠魚，形態可分龍，蛋，草，望天，等種。色澤有紅，白，黃，黑，紫，藍，五花，玳瑁，諾類。蓋珠魚產自百粵，其原種殊不耐看，尖首巨腹，尾雖四被，而搖曳不能生姿，過形短絀也，僅鱗間累累如貫珠，體愈大而愈顯，鮮態與花色，均為北運後與他種交配始得。</p>
<p>珠魚飼養甚難，藝魚者視為畏途，其病症有印血，紅顋，停食，浮面等等。但能得魚之性，庶幾有濟，且陽光足，給食多，換水勤，其發育可超過普通速度。（惟悶缸時要留心，此亦利弊相輔也。）</p>
<p>寧紹商輪公司之周松麟君，為海上私家藝珠魚之能手，承以藝珠魚新法見吿，並蒙慨賜發頭十六尾，中有全白一種，珠尤顯露，腹部更甚，體形圓似球狀，尾亦四張，較普通種類已美觀多多，蓋已由原種套化矣。</p>
<p>周君之言曰：珠魚腹部愈圓滿，則珠愈顯露，使之膨脹，則多給水蛆可矣。但水宜長淸，勤換熟水，而向陽則愈足愈佳，日中不必張蓋蘆簾，其給食，據吿：寸許之魚十餘尾，置一缸中，日食濾乾水蛆兩匙，宜先予一半，使盡，然後再予之。同時另置一留有熟水之空缸，（所謂空缸者，無魚也，非無水之謂。）候其晨間至午飯時分，兩匙之水蛆或可吿罄，設有餘，亦不必再等吃完，蓋日有五六小時之吃食，已較常魚增加兩倍。故於午間卽宜將飽食珠魚超於淸水空缸中，而原缸之水卽更之，明日，仍如前法施行，（兩星期，卽見長成？較常魚速大數倍。周君贈我之十六尾，卽當年第二三批小魚，頃其腹已有胡桃大，首尾度之，約有寸許，則其長足發育可以知矣。</p>
<h3>狂風中的殘燭</h3>

<h3>記了緣和尚</h3>
<p>— 甲辰生</p>
<p>了緣和尚，爲今世之奇僧，現方寄跡於江蘇儀徵縣城之天寗寺古剎中，望之若五六十許人，實則彼之年齡當在一百三四十歲，有謂彼己二百數十春秋，然終無可稽考耳。</p>
<p>了緣雖係出家和尚，然不善誦經念佛，彼在天寗寺中，因鎭日無所事事，於是黎明卽起身出外，日暮方歸寺歇宿。終日週遊於全城各街巷，遇有道路損壞處，彼卽為之修復，自朝至晚，不言語，不飲食，見人更白眼相視，卽有人强與之語，彼終笑而不答。</p>
<p>民國九年秋，余客館儀徵，聞人言了緣和尙之異，特往訪之於天寗寺，數往皆不遇。據該寺退居方丈海峯和尙語予，海峯於六七歲入廟披剃時，卽見了緣在，當時年已五六十，茲海峯已由小沙彌而大和尙，由方丈而退居，壽亦七十外，了緣則依然如昔也。聖寬方丈則云，來寺三十餘年，僅與了緣談話一次，悉彼為四川人，具有一身武藝，初入邪途，嗣覺悟出家為僧，因自幼不識文字，中年始出家，故經懺亦無所知云，此外則不知其詳。</p>
<p>光陰倐忽，予已十五年不至儀徵，今番舊地重遊，特至天寗寺中一覘此特異之僧人，仍與相值，一切與十五年前無異，望之仍如五六十許人，丰采依然，若有駐顏術或長生術者。噫，是誠今世之奇僧也，歸而記其概略如上。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>日本的消夏飲料</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>在我國吃慣了西瓜的人，到了日本便要感覺着不便，日本並不是沒有西瓜，不過價格貴而味劣。在大都會裏，西瓜都從鄕下運來，加上運費，於是要一塊多錢一個。我國馬路旁西瓜攤上的一塊大紅西瓜，大約二三個銅元罷了，在東京都要買一角錢之多，我國的西瓜，以黃色白色為佳，紅色最次。日本西瓜都是我們最嫌惡的血紅顏色，皮很薄，小而且園，形如浜瓜，水果店裏的西瓜，都鄭重其事的放在玻璃櫥裏，與蘋果檸檬為伍，和我國隨地亂堆，其優渥不啻天壤之別。冷食店裏有冰西瓜出售，和着白糖冰屑，此種吃法，自歐美傳入，吃瓜用糖，在我國人看來，眞要認為是笑話的。我相信日本人還沒有發現我國黃色白色西瓜的優點，否則他們那有不試種之理的。</p>
<p>在夏天吃西瓜的習慣，並無我國的普遍。原因是西瓜太貴了，一般人只好吃冰水和冰洪淋。冰淇淋很廉只有五分錢一個，生意當然很好。馬路上的小販所製的每個只有一分錢，其危險性則不亞於飲冷水，另有一種冰淇淋內中和着赤豆饀，是日人勞働界唯一的飲料，價格更廉，顏色作紫色和我國黑色的不同。日本的粉食糕糰，都是紫色的豆沙饀，肉饀是沒有的。在夏天飲料店裏出售着溫熱的赤豆湯，其味遠不及我國的淸凉綠豆湯。</p>
<p>「蜜之豆是初夏和新秋約飲物，宛如我國的凉粉，不過切成很小的方塊，形式便覺美觀，另外和着墨　一　漿軟糖，顏色很鮮美的。我國的凉粉，如能用科學方法改良一下，未嘗不可成為平民的良好飲料。</p>
<p>冰牛乳也是很好的消夏飲料，尤其我國留學生最喜歡。日人早晨吃飯，只用一碗醬湯。我國人不能下咽，只好吃着牛乳麵包。在日本的牛乳很便宜，最廉的只有五分錢一瓶，大都用低溫度殺菌方法消毒。但報上發表衛生處檢騐各公司的牛乳，有三分之一都不合標準，內中和水的含病菌的都有。日本商人素以正直著名，此種弊害，尙不能避免。紅茶是我國普通的飲料，在日本是十分尊貴的，認為是西洋人的嗜好品，和咖啡可可相等。在夏天有冰紅茶，中間和着白糖果汁，面上浮着一片檸檬，其味確和可可咖啡差不多的，已失茶味。</p>
<p>我國人民有便宜的西瓜和各種飲料，而日本一般人都我不到價廉而合宜的飲料。眼看着冷食店的顧客，川流不息的出入着，只好吸一杯淡而無味的自來水，暫時使身心淸凉一下。所以事實上，日本人所受暑天的困苦，要比我國深刻些呢。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>將安息前的半小時光景；太后旣把那些鷄子淸用香皂和淸水洗去以後，接着便得另外搽上一種液汁，這種液汁也是太后自己所發明的，它的製法如下：</p>
<p>製造的手續是並不怎樣繁複的，只是那一套用具却很特別。它的構造的意義大致和現代的蒸溜器相同，全部是銅製的，一排共是三個圓筒：第一個圓筒裏面是安着少許的水和酒精，下面用不很猛烈的火燄蒸着，於是那酒精和水所蒸發成了的水汽便打一根很細的銅管裏流往第一個圓筒裏去，這第二個圓洞內是滿裝着許多的耐冬花，下面也燃着火，待第一個圓洞內流來的汽水，再合着這些耐冬花蒸煮上一食之後，自然又蒸發成一種水汽，這種水汽便打另外一支細銅管中流進了第三個圓筒去；這時候所得的水汽，，已是酒精，水和耐冬花三者所混合成的精液了，而且是充滿着一股花香，像我們所習見的香水精差不多。又因蒸煮它很費工夫，不能不預先積儲若干，以便太后每晚敷用。這種液汁據說是富於收歛性的，它能使太后臉上方才已給鷄子淸綳得很緊的一部份的皮膚的重復寬弛起來，但又能使那些皺紋不再伸長或擴大，功效異常偉大；因此每晚太后在上床以前所做的最末的一件事，便是搽抹這種花液。（四〇八）</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>國貨前途怎樣？</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨的前途怎樣？有持悲觀論的，有抱樂觀論的。據吾最近的聞見和觀察，我國貨界的命運，確實不錯，前面不但是一條生路，而且是康莊大道。前天民生實業公司張澍霖先生在中華國貨產銷合作恊會的一席話，鼓勵國貨界的勇氣，眞是達於極點。張君說：「國貨界擴展的地方，廣大極了，到處可以謀生路，到處可以做交易，卽如我們天府的四川，便是一個銷貨的大區域。從以連年兵匪擾亂，地方多故，以致人家害怕，談虎色變。目下便不同了，自從蔣委員長駐節以後，共匪肅淸，兵隊遣散，從前一百八十七師，不數月而裁去其半，地方秩序，旣然恢復，人民的購買力，自然增加。此後優良的國貨，大可馳騁於西蜀」云云。這是國貨界一個好消息。</p>
<p>西北問題研究會郭維屏君，最近自四川給我的信。他說成都市民五十萬，重慶市民一百萬，目下都在安居樂業之中，一致的需要優良國貨。所以到四川來辦國貨公司，是目前急切的一件事，地方上人民都很歡迎。陜西甘肅，也有同樣的傾向。「國貨界到西北去」這句口號，現在可以實幹了。這是國貨界又一個好消息。</p>
<p>張君惠康等旣辦中華工業國際貿易恊會，沈君肇基又辦中華國貨貿易協會，一致注目於國外貿易的擴展。張君沈君均為國貨工廠之領袖，目光遠大，果能實心實力，努力於國貨外銷之工作，吾知成績必有可觀。最近陳蝶仙君，又有國產貿易所之發起，本以物易物使供求適合之宗旨，為國貨打開一條門路。吾亦十分贊同。這是國貨界第三個好消息。</p>
<p>國貨界的前途，只有光明，沒有黑暗，只有樂觀，不必悲觀。</p>
<h3>國貨界應注意的二點</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>前天和一個辦國貨工廠的經理某君，談起推銷國貨問題，他說，近年來因為國貨界努力的宣傳，國貨用品已被大多數人民所認識了。這是一件很可喜的消息。不過國貨界裏面，因為銷路一旺，便發生下列二現象：（一）同業傾軋。（二）粗製濫造。現在我把這二點意思寫出來，或者可以給國貨界一個忠吿吧！</p>
<p>（甲）同業傾軋說到同業合作國貨界中有一部自私心較深的大工廠，每每憑着自己的資本厚，地位高，傲視其他小工廠，任意貶價，想自己霸佔市塲，在外國，因為他們國家經濟雄厚，當然不生問題。可是我們中國，去萬萬使不得，在這樣幼穉的民族工業，我們要努力創辦還　不及，怎可以自相摧殘呢！在國貨和舶來品競爭的時候，大的工廠好像是有威權的將領，小的工廠好像是勇敢的兵士，二者是應該互相聯絡，不能再存私見，自趨絕路了。我以為大的工廠應該顧慮小同業的處境，不可獨斷獨行，尤應該幾方面携起手來，另關安全的途徑。不然，大家都鑽在一個事業，而讓其他事業握在外商手裏，這不是很可笑嗎？總之，團結卽是力量，我們國貨的力量，在國貨同業摒除私見，互相團結之下的。</p>
<p>（乙）粗製濫造是自絕其路的事國貨界因為同業方面的互相傾軋，貶價賤售，於是一方面，要使得成本减低便只好偷工减料，粗製濫造了。有一些初用國貨的朋友們，時常拿一件損壞的國貨工具給我瞧，一面說：「你勸我用國貨，　原想也不錯。可是這東西，不過輕輕地一碰，就立刻壞了，你想，中國貨可以用得嗎？』這種話，當然是錯的，不過我們國貨界不求改進，確是實情。須知使主顧失望，是關店第一步工作。我的意思，以為與其費很多錢，刋登朦人一時的廣吿，不如努力改良。這不是高明多多嗎？國貨的同業界，想貶價，傾軋，來招徠主顧，不如用改進的出品，給社會人士一個深刻的認識吧！</p>
<p>這是很明顯的一個例子，華茶華絲，本來在國外市塲佔很多勢力的，可是因為同業的不互相合作，改良得又不使外人十分滿意，到現在，差不多營業一落千丈了。我們賢明的國貨界諸君，知道了這前車可鑒，該如何謀本業的穩健，找出新途徑來，使得我們的市塲，不致為別人所操縱了啊！</p>
<h3>各地民衆教育館應有國貨宣傳的建議</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>這幾年來，各地民衆教育館的設立，無疑義地是風起雲湧，漸次普遍，尤其是在內地各個鄉鎭，據我這次返里—於浙西幾個，小市鎭上，經過而調査的結果，深知民衆敎育館在當地人們心目中，實為最強有力的改良生活的指導者，鄕村民衆在業餘時間，總是到這裏來，游覽啊！閱讀書報啊！成了他唯一的精神休息處，而在這裏，我却也就順便調査國貨教育的有否加以施行，那却是使我大為失望，因為大都是連國貨救國的字樣都沒有，這眞是莫大的缺憾，引起我有向各地民衆館，務須要有宣揚國貨使命建議的必要。</p>
<p>本來，民衆教育館是都要負由每個地方人民，使他們生活向上的責任的。所以，在這中國農村破產，內地經濟崩潰，而洋貨傾銷，却在深入民間，無孔不入的時候，大家知道我們只有從提倡國貨，發展生產這條路上，去挽救全國人們淪於飢餓和破產的危機，而民衆敎育館在敎導民衆日趨改良生活的立塲上，對於國貨敎育的向大家薰陶，實尤應有更大的努力，至少要使我國佔全人口百分之八十以上的農民，大家團結一致，拒用洋貨和提倡國產，消滅歷年來來我國的巨大入超，繁榮工商和安定民族經濟。</p>
<p>現在，我就依照自己的意見，把希望各地民衆敎育館，應有的幾個宣揚國貨設施，寫在下而：</p>
<p>（一）應設本地土產陳列所　將本地各種的土產品，特闢一室陳列，以便客地民衆參觀時，可知道本地各種土產的特長，寓有闡揚土產和使從事土產者有精益求精的意思。</p>
<p>（二）應設機製國貨陳列處　我們曉得土產品大都祗為本地的農產品，或手工製造品，而在這洋貨機襲品，深入內地傾銷的現下，我們實尤有設一國貨機製品陳列處的必要，向滬上各廠徵求貨樣陳列，以使當地大衆可知國貨的精美，並熟識商標貨名，易於採購。</p>
<p>（三）多向民衆施行國貨敎育如利用多數民衆在館時間，舉行國貨演講，國貨化妝表演等，並在壁上應、多貼國貨標語，國貨圖畫，國貨統計等，以警惕的語句，來喚醒民衆。</p>
<h3>如何使學生服用國貨</h3>
<p>— 顧錦藻</p>
<p>中國近百年來，痛受帝國主義之經濟侵略，遂使國家經濟，陷於絕境，民族前途，岌岌可危！國人有鑒於此，為謀根本救濟起見，乃有抵制外貨與提倡國貨之運動，以挽救今日之危機！政府並特定今年為學生國貨年，俾從全國學生做起，良以學生為國家的知識份子，以身作則，倡導於先，庶羣相倣傚而實踐！我們竭誠希望今年的學生國貨年牧有相當的效果，爰草擬數條簡而易行的方法，供全國學校採用：</p>
<p>（一）學校　瓖境佈置　環境影響人類的生活，關係很大，要使學生服用國貨，必先佈臘適當的環境，如張貼各種警醒的標語各　　　或統針表（如國貨工業調査統計表，中國受各國經濟償略之損失統計，外貨輸入與國貨輸出比較表）此外還可掛貼影片如各種國貨品和生產技術的攝影等陳列實物如搜集各種日常用品中屬於國貨者與非國貨者俾畢生知所警惕！</p>
<p>（二）集會訓練　學校中每逢紀念週週會和每日精神訓話晨會，夕會以及其他紀念日等相機漢輸畢生服用國貨的觀念；以期養成習慣！</p>
<p>（三）宣警　全校師生典同訂定公約以資遵守，並舉行服用國貨宣警典禮，儀式須隆重，違者施以相當處罰。</p>
<p>（四）陳列國貨展覽會　陳列各種國貨用品，俾學生了解與認識。</p>
<p>（五）組織國貨調査隊或宣傳隊　利用紀念日放假日等獎勵學生分往各處調査且傳，並規勸家庭親戚朋友等服用國貨，學生須以身作則，倡導力行！</p>
<p>（六）舉行國貨講演會　激發學生愛國思想與服用國貨之决心。</p>
<p>（七）舉行徵文競賽　徵文範圍如「如何發展國貨工業「如何提倡國貨」其他如有關提倡國貨的散女詩歌等。</p>
<p>（八）參觀調査　師生利用假日及紀念日分往附近各地參觀國貨工廠或其他大公司等，以增進學生對於國貨之認識，激發其研究改進之興趣。</p>
<p>（九）選舉模範學生　經全校師生共同考核推選服用國貨堪為模範者一人，題名公布獎勵之。</p>
<p>（十）編選各科敎材　各科敎學機會聯絡如選讀名人傳紀，國貨工業發明史，歷年外貨輸入與輸出之比較，中國受經濟侵略之損失，此外還可研究發展中國國貨，工業之研究等，俾學生得有更深切更明瞭之認識，而收實際效果！</p>
<p>上面各點，各校如果努力實行起來，定有相當的效果！學生是國家未來的主人翁，民族生命的泉源，我們竭誠希望先從全國學生做起，民族復興，胥在於斯！</p>
<h3>冼冠生在蘇農講演別記</h3>
<p>— 王飄萍</p>
<p>蘇州下津橋農業學校，本學期遵省方訓令添設糖果製造廠，用以改良國產糖果，隔昨舉行開學典禮，特請海上實業家冼冠生先生蒞校講演，現身說法，語多精闢，愛掇拾一二，以實本刊，亦有心研究糖果事業者之一助也。以下均為冼君語；</p>
<p>糖果宜普遍化……糖果為白常消費品，孩提尤多酷嗜，故衡之情理，其銷額當遠勝於烟捲。然徵諸事實，却未必盡然，我人但見烟紙店之充斥於街頭巷尾甚至深入窮鄕僻壞，而糖果之勢力，殊不若也。此中原由，實因糖果之價格，過於昂貴，僅藉少數貴族階級為銷費之尾閭，故今後須認淸目標，力求平民化，經濟化，信下天羅地雞，吸收各階級廣大之羣衆，如此青能立於不敗之地。</p>
<p>糖果與民族健康……糖果親之為小這，其實表裏因果，做開國家民族健康，日本家庭中對於無育嬰孩，恒桐以鮮潔之糖果，於糖果中則　入多量之牛奶，蓋牛奶富滋養料，服之對身體發育，殊多裨盡，我人苟　　於彼邦公園中，隨地可見賸下之牛奶糖空　，一若我國之隨地可見香烟空效也。故年來日人之體格突飛猛進，此中實有潛移默助之功，獨惜國人未嘗注意及此，良用惋惜耳。</p>
<p>當今製造糖果應有之認識……今日從事糖果業者，採用原料，當盡量取之於當地農村，如此農工商打成一片，亦所以嘉惡農民，但國人每好棋仿外人，其實如中國之紹興酒，味甘淸醇，較之舶來白蘭地有過之而無不及。故紹興人祇求在紹興酒本身上加以精研，已屬上乘。推而廣之，南京板鴨，揚州醬菜，黃埭瓜子，鎭江醋，靡不獨擅勝長，而克享盛名。當地人士，　手就其當地土產加以改良，以臻於盡善盡美之境，殊無用剽竊西法，憧憬於全盤西化也。蘇州原以出產糖果著名，貴校最好抱定改良當地土產為職志。……</p>
<p>最後冼君謂舉辦任何事業，脫不了三本主義，三本主義者何？卽一。本心，二·本領，三·本錢，苟能具此三項條件，可無往而不利云去，語重心長，聽者為之動容。</p>
<p>黃山茶莊開幕　新閘路四百三十二—四號黃山茶莊，昨晨開幕，到有來賓楊嘯天，許世英氏代表黃伯度，以及各界聞人胡一波。周扶靑，四川旅滬商界鉅子羅子東等數十人，至八時一刻奏樂，請楊處長揭幕，並致頌詞曰：『奕奕黃山，皖中名勝，猗　寳莊，克相輝映，茶甘如飴，周詩有詠，百品皆珍，陸經是證，大業鼎新，隆基肇定，聊貢蕪辭，紀茲美盛』，是日顧客盈門，並攝影以誌紀念。</p>
<p>新出電木熱水瓶　本埠著名電木廠公一電木工業社，該廠出品人面派電母電玉日用品，早已受人歡迎，最敬該廠又新出人面牌新式電木熱水瓶數種，溫度負責保暖、式樣新穎別緻，顏色幽雅合理，誠國貨之雋品也。普通熱水瓶時有發生銹爛，惟電木熱水瓶則不銹不爛，堅牢耐用，該廠為普及起見，定價甚廉，本埠外埠各大百貨商店，均有經售。</p>

<h3>嬌紅記與嬌紅傳</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>最近「世界文庫」第三册刋岀了明初劉東生的雜劇「嬌紅記」二本，真是戲曲研討者的好消息。以前王國維編曲錄時，不曾見到原書，誤書作一本，實際是上下二卷，卷各四折，應該書作二本的。他所根據的太和正音譜亦作二本，想他不至疎忽至此，當係筆誤。</p>
<p>世界文庫第三册向時把元宋梅洞的「嬌紅傳」也印了岀來，據花陣綺言和國色天香重刋，並取繡谷春容和燕居筆記來校勘，這樣慎重把「嬌紅記」所根據改編的小説介紹對於讀者的比較閲覧，實有很大的便利。</p>
<p>小説「嬌紅傳」由於女主人公嬌娘和飛紅得名，大意叙甥申純省問舅父母，與嬌娘初次相見，即寓於舅家，得間常與嬌娘相見，遂通情欵，後申生父催歸，生乃與嬌别。别後託媒向舅父提婚，舅父以内親不婚拒。一日，生為友邀赴妓憐憐處，因念嬌，狀殊不快，妓問之，乃以念一美女相告。妓岀一圖，云為帥府子求婚，託人私繪者。生見圖，果即嬌，妓乃向索舊鞋。會生再赴舅家，乘間竊嬌鞋，為飛紅所見，忽遽間失鞋，為飛紅所得。飛紅亦愛生者，乃藉此欲毁申嬌之令譽；並趁申嬌遊園時，設計使舅母見之。生恐又告歸。後生及第，舅召往。適有死鬼幻嬌形媚生，幸為嬌窺破，怪乃絶。嬌復恩結飛紅，得與生續歡。舅有贅生為婿意，不幸帥府子又以力强訂其女。申與嬌俱鬱鬱死，死者父母乃為合葬。</p>
<p>嬌紅傳最後下評語道：「人之年少而遭此禍，蓋為父母者不為之察其心，而觀其志也，豈不哀哉，豈不痛哉！」在元代而能為此語，責備父母不應干涉子女的戀愛，實是值得佩服的，但他後來又責備申純和嬌娘，「流連光景，貪於私樂。數載之間，惶惶不暇，卒至窮廹而死！……事雖有不然，而理不得以不然。……節義大閑，萬古不易，予始雖為二子恨，終實為二子喜！」就未免迂腐之氣，廹於眉睫了。</p>
<p>嬌紅傳中鬼的插叙，使得一篇寫實小説變成怪誕不經的，很是可惜，這大約是自唐代「任氏傳」「秦夢記」等一向相沿如此，所以不易打破這因襲的除套。但悲劇的結局却是值得稱讚的。還有一些對話，也很機警活潑，同時能够把戀愛心理表現岀來。</p>
<p>在看過嬌紅傳以後，便覺嬌紅記實是一種笨伯的工作。劉公依樣畫葫蘆的嬌紅傳所有的情節完全搬了進去，一點也不肯抛棄，一點也不肯更動，未免太忠實於原作了！甚至連小説中多量的詩詞也都搬到舞台上去。他也不想想，觀衆聽着台上莫名其妙地念着一時不易領會的詩詞，彷彿聽小學生背書一樣該是怎樣的難過！又為了在區區八折以内，要滴水不漏地包括所有的情節，勢必利用追叙的方法，於是主角不登台則已，一登台就是千言不休，（面一四—五，又面二四）連詩詞帶書信像木瓜似的一動也不動的坐在臺上念下去，這又是使觀衆多麽的難受！再者，嬌紅傳所有的好處，嬌紅記却一點也不曾保留。悲劇改成了喜劇，申嬌合配，他們倆原是金童玉女下凡，劫數滿後，仍回仙界，因此又添上了許多鬼話。並且，活潑的對話也看不見了！試看，嬌紅傳叙申純得飛紅詞，以為是嬌娘作的。「嬌人生室，正疑思不言，忽見案上花室，正疑思不言，忽見案上花箋，因取視之，良久目申生，不語移時。生曰：「子何時所作也？」嬌不答。生又曰：「何故不言？」嬌亦不應。生力窮之，嬌曰：「此飛紅詞也，君自彼得之，何必詐妾？」生力辯，嬌並無言，徘徊良久，長吁竟拂衣起去。」這誤會，這小兩口子吵架，是寫得極好。彷彿我們聽見嬌娘冷笑一聲道：「哼哼，這是飛紅寫的詞，你從他那兒拿來的，何必裝假來騙我呢？」她忍住了眼淚，帶着不快的面容，低着頭來回走了幾步，忽然把頭抬了起來，露岀堅决的樣子，無限悽哀的把頭一偏，别過身來就跑了。嬌紅傳是活潑的寫着：「此飛紅詞也，君自彼得之，何必詐妾？」到了嬌紅記却被譯成這樣呆板的句子：「這詞兒是飛紅做的，你怎麽説這是我做的？」神情語態，全都失去。老實人説老實話；我説是譯，倒是實情，幾乎全篇都可以拿來對照的，簡直是把文言一句一句的譯成白話！</p>
<p>太和正意譜稱劉東生之詞如海矯雲霞；又云，鎔意鑄詞，織無塵氣，可與王實甫輩並驅。我看未免失實。我敢説嬌紅記是一部失敗的作品，不但不能上演，即詞句亦未見岀色，最多只是工穩而已。</p>
<p>嬌紅記刻本誤將題目正名置於第二折之後，應移於第四折之後，已經振鐸指岀。此外錯簡的地方還有兩處：</p>
<p>（一）卷上似應截至面一四尾聲唱完後「末旦俱下，做别科」為止，題目正名應排於此下。接着「申伯禮上云，（未上云衍）小生與小姐夜去明來」便該是卷下楔子的開端。到卷下仙吕端正好（原本誤書正宫。北詞廣正譜云：「仙吕端正好楔兒不入套數，與正宫不同；正宫不可增損，仙吕可增損。」）唱完，末同外旦俱下，楔子就算完結。否則卷上最後末與外旦對話，並未明書下塲，就此完結，實有「四金剛騰雲」之感。而卷下一開端就這樣莫名其妙的來一個仙吕端正好，也不知是誰唱的，唱完又忽然冒岀末同外旦來，並且立刻下去，就又使人有「丈二金剛」之感了。</p>
<p>（二）卷下面二四與二五必有錯簡之處，很難淸理。否則怎麽面二四旦上，已説明與飛紅和好，「漸漸的買他心轉來了；」面二五反説「飛紅和我兩個不投機」呢？較之嬌紅傳次序，似乎面二四行一九「小慧（應了科）」一起，至面二五行一一「旦下」止，應該移在面二四行一前面。</p>
<p>全劇八折，均由末唱，很是得體；因為嬌紅傳原書也是著重在申純一面的。第一楔子由金童玉女合唱；破了一人獨唱的例，本來這時元曲的規例已經逐漸打破了。</p>
<h3>蹺蹺板（四）</h3>
<p>— 白塵</p>
<p>白墻擋在前面，裏面吵得更厲害了，小和尚也就更着急，更難過。——球兒倒看不見了。</p>
<p>墻是那末長，那末長，怎麽才看得見呢？朝東跑，找到一個大門了，門裏是一排一排的洋房，也没有一隻球。在門外瞧了半天，不見個動靜，也没個人聲。小毛頭跟在小和尚屁股後轉來轉去，更不敢闁進門去。</p>
<p>「啊塊厂丫？」小毛頭急得苦着臉。</p>
<p>小和尚再跑到西邊來，在白粉墻下又是「通」兒「通」的了，又是嘻嘻哈哈的了。真怪！</p>
<p>通……</p>
<p>裏面不曉得有多多少少人都呌起來了：「哦……」！</p>
<p>忽然一隻圓球斜飛上了天，小毛頭正呌了一聲：「哥」，球兒已經回頭掉到牆外來了。小和尚一見就没命的跑上去。</p>
<p>「哦！……」他大呌一聲，心裏像鷄爪子的一樣歡喜：牠終於岀來了！</p>
<p>小毛頭也跟着跑，但怕他哥哥搶了去，一邊哼着：「咹！……」</p>
<p>「不要拾，小和尚！」媽媽在後面呌，可没有用。</p>
<p>眼看見那隻圓球落在草地上，離自己只有一二十步遠了。突然，來了一聲狂呌：「不許動！！」</p>
<p>從那白粉牆的那一頭轉岀一個人來。没穿衣裳，身上只套了一個小背心：也没穿褲子，腿襠裏祗有那麽一點點布。要動他兩條膀子兩條腿，像糖揑的猴兒要棍。頭頂上一撮毛，頭兒顛的像獅子狗兒。小和尚挨他駭了一跳，怔住了。但想一想：「不是他的吧？」又三脚兩步　到草地裏，將用手去一捺，硬梆梆地又帶點軟勁兒，一碰就跑了。但那個猴兒可又呌了：「滚過去！」一步已躥到面前。手一撥，脚一挺，「通！」球隨脚起，飛到天雲眼裏去了。</p>
<p>「乖乖！」小和尚眼睛　把　地看上去。</p>
<p>那猴兒回身又跑了。順着白粉牆一直向西。忽然一轉身，不見了。</p>
<h3>東京街頭</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>自從學校放了暑假以後，我就更比以前寂寞起來，為的是原先在一塊的朋友都星散了。有錢的到海邊去洗海水浴去了，有家的回到祖國去了，留在東京的只是寥寥幾個人而已。我自己原也是想到外邊去走動走動，而事實上，海邊因不能去，有家也不得歸，眼看着一個又一個地帶着笑臉離開了東京，好像感到東京忽然瘦了下來，寂寞了下來似的。不消説的，日子更比以前拉得長，而且空閑了許多，書擺在面前不想去讀牠，筆擺在眼前也不想去寫牠，放日子無可奈何地閃過去，閃了一天又一天，暑假後又將近半個月了。</p>
<p>前些時候，學校没有放假以前，儘管抱着書包到學校里去，把日子打發在學校的教室里，日子雖長也並不覺得牠長，而現在，日子完全放在自己房間里，由自己去安排，書已無心去讀牠，朋友又全都星散，生活就忽然失去了重心，一切都感到懶洋洋地，帶着掛惦的心又想到了家，家前家後那些小樹上的鳴蟬，每到黄昏過後，一個人到街頭去散步，有的時候也到喫茶店里去吃茶，那些下女們誤解了人家的心腸，她以為常常一個人悄悄地去又悄悄地離開，或對她身上有什麽念頭，總是含情含笑地對着你，難道你不會感到空虚嗎？</p>
<p>帶着空虚的心回到了自己的家，躱在椅子上，看些剛從祖國友人寄來的那些音訊，由于日子太過空閑，生岀了許多無端的煩惱，十分想從友人的音訊中得些慰藉的東西，這點倒還並没有完全失望，有些友人確實給了我許多鼓勵，我該感激他們的。</p>
<p>這二天以來，蟬聲忽然從樹梢頭上傳岀來，「知了，知了」地聽起來倒還不討厭，前年住在上海的時候，對着窓口就有一株大樹，樹上有着好多鳴蟬，也總是「知了，知了」地在呌着，有的時候牠做了你午睡的催眠歌，有的時候卻又常常把你從夢中喊醒，使人又愛又恨牠，今天聽了這蟬聲，忽然憶起那時節的一般情境來了。</p>
<h3>流浪</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>挨過黑夜了，</p>
<p>太陽透進來一綫紅嫩的光芒。</p>
<p>我帶着昏眩的腦袋，</p>
<p>我帶着空空的肚子，</p>
<p>又開始在繁華的街頭流浪。</p>
<p>只值得四毫錢的舊帽子，</p>
<p>四天前曾跑回十間當舖。</p>
<p>如今，我真想把衣服脱個淸光。</p>
<p>也許他們當我是癲狂而拒絶了吧。</p>
<p>我只得皺着眉頭，</p>
<p>拖着兩條沉重的腿兒，</p>
<p>一擺一拐地流浪。</p>
<p>黄昏，我又帶着飢餓的身子躺在床上，想：「明天呀！别再這樣的流浪吧！」</p>
<h3>憶</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>北國的霉雨時節是比江南遲滯一點的，可也是那樣一陣子亮太陽一陣子灰雲蓋住了整個天幕，但比這更討厭的是雨後池塘似的泥窪，這呌用鞋子走路的人只有皺眉的份兒了。</p>
<p>在被雨阻不能往外跑時，便愛開了大門來瞧瞧天，瞧瞧那靜靜的胡同，看着雨珠積成水潭。</p>
<p>不會使人失望的。是在這時岀世的賣豌豆的孩子的呌賣聲一定會岀現，撑着破傘，一手托着冒熱汽的小筐，還有，那一雙在水裏跋涉的精光的小腿。</p>
<p>時常在這條灣曲的小巷裏穿走的賣豌豆孩子是一個圓臉，有着一雙小細眼睛的，另外，是那和小眼不相襯的一對大耳朶有點呌人特殊注意的魔力。</p>
<p>這臉相加着這綿綿的霉雨，在我腦膜上尋到了一個記憶，也是一個小眼大耳的孩子，只是為的是江南人的原故吧，比這尖脚的白晳一些。</p>
<p>那是故鄉的老鄰的孩子，在外祖母没有死去的時候便熟稔着的了，雖然後來大家都搬了開來，但一點交誼還没有割斷，孩子的母親的苦臉常在我們這破落院子裏岀現，聽説一點苦楚，然後在每一個並不寛裕的「嫂嫂姊姊」的手中拿去一件舊衣或是一把極有限的銅板角子。</p>
<p>「真是没有辦法呢，阿和爸爸的私塾一天天冷落，學生老拖欠着學費，好像來上課都不值得的神氣，阿和上縣立小　的零用又真可以……」臨走，總那麽陪着笑的，不憚煩地致着歉意，末了總是：</p>
<p>「我為了阿和吃着苦難，只盼他小學畢業，…我自己每天「調錦」（註）下來的錢給他添點筆墨…」</p>
<p>常是泣着般的，紅了眼珠兒岀去，那些「嫂嫂姊姊」們便也唏嘘起來，各自發揮着自己的意見。大半總是嫌這女人的忍耐力太大，為什麽不和一個在没有飯吃的苦境中吞烟泡的男人撒手，但對這意見，阿和娘一向就有個回答：</p>
<p>「不是那樣説，究竟是一二十年之恩情……」感到羞怛，嚅嚅的：「他也是好人家落到這般田地，阿和也是他的心肝哩……」</p>
<p>這倒是真話，老鄰居們全知道阿和爸借債給兒子買醬肉吃的事，斷炊時便把僅有的一些　飯給兒子吃。</p>
<p>前年暑假阿和畢業了，早三個月便忙壞了作媽的，四處央告着謀事，條件是除了體力勞動外什麽都行。也曾有人介紹過到大商家學點手藝的，他結果全是被一筆較大的壓櫃錢難住了，在這時候才聽得到女人對丈夫的一些怨艾：他已經把信用丢盡了。搓了手，便又等待另一個時機。</p>
<p>在去年的霉雨天，三叔給阿和找到了一個在照相館當學徒的事，阿和娘笑盈盈地給孩子穿上一件比較整齊的竹布長衫，把他交給三叔領去。女人喜喜歡歡地申述着自己的期望，和大家談長論短，眼裏泛着笑：</p>
<p>「照相館裏的先生們是不會挨餓的，這一家便靠阿和撑起來，長衫總不致脱掉……」</p>
<p>正如一些瞧見阿和娘的光榮日子的人們所説，她是「好木頭上斷下來的」，在這許多顛沛中，她念念不忘的還是面子和禮貌，無論在多麽艱窘的時候，阿和娘的一條裙子總是繫得「畢挺」，不管那上面已有了補綻。孩子岀來時，一件長衫已是少不了的。</p>
<p>第三天淸早，一夜的大雨還没有止住，天還是灰灰的像魚網似的要把大地罩住，早上起來母親便對着一大盆待洗的衣服發愁時，門響起來。</p>
<p>阿和母子倆合撑着一把不大的洋傘進來，兩人游得像木鷄似的，水珠直在孩子的眼角淌，像是淚。樣兒是那樣怯人的，躱在母親身後，把衣角遮着嘴。</p>
<p>作媽媽的又是一把鼻涕一把淚，將兒子的逃回來的事述説得那樣委婉，呌人不能責怪只好憐惜：</p>
<p>「孩子是不懂事，為了師傅呌侍候得太煩便受不了，可是，倒夜壺，點烟，倒茶的事也真没幹過……」</p>
<p>這原是三叔想到的，那已是一家背了運的照相館，主人喜歡聚賭，但想到那孩子在家挨餓便給介紹了。</p>
<p>女人又陪了笑臉説好話，據説已把孩子教訓了一頓，願意回店去，求三叔再送回，給求一聲饒。</p>
<p>「罵兩聲不碍，就是别打……」女人把孩子又留下了。</p>
<p>後來是失敗了，主人已不肯收回，三叔碰了一鼻子灰。阿和低着頭回家了。</p>
<p>一年來弄得更不像話，有去過阿和家的來説，這父母孩子三個全染上疥瘡了，兩口子之間少不了詈罵，私塾關了門，孩子抓着瘡疤抹淚……</p>
<p>那小眼，那大耳朶……</p>
<p>望着門口賣豌豆的孩子時便不由地記起那江南的孩子，相彷的臉龐，身材——就是白晳了點！</p>
<p>眼前像是浮起了阿和一副苦臉，在大雨裏跟了母親游來游去，懦怯得像一頭餓久了的鼠子。</p>
<p>又想起那女人的黑紡綢裙，那上面有着縫補過了的大洞小洞，和孩子的竹布長衫——</p>
<p>記起我並不怎樣眷念的故鄉，便同時想到這小眼大耳的白晳皮膚的孩子，不知道他近來找到了職業没有。</p>
<p>註：把繅好了的絲調成繞好，在故鄉是一種很舊的婦女職業。</p>

<h3>外交手段之二</h3>
<p>— 順</p>
<p>訂立短時間的戰時中立法案</p>
<p>號稱金元國的美國，素來持監保泰在世界上可說是一位和平之神，故美國不但對於此次意阿戰爭，積極反對，（雖未曾積極表示態度，其意思大抵如是，）便是對於任何侵略國家，多要說幾句公道的話，但是深恐自已捲入戰爭漩渦，無論如何，不　甘為戎首，所以此次對於意國的侵略行為，明知無法解决，羅斯福馬上發表宣言，訂立戰時中立法案。</p>
<p>這原是美國的審愼周詳，不肯冒險從事的一種態度，但是所最奇怪的，便是此次訂立戰時中立法案，為期僅有半年，自本年九月一日起至明年二月二十九日止，這種中立法案，時期不免太短吧？因為此次意阿戰爭，雖未開始，但據一般軍事家考察阿意的戰事，須得四五年，方得結果，而此次訂立戰時中立法條，為期不過半年，萬一該法案期滿之後，而戰事尙未終止，則美國將處如何的態度呢？</p>
<p>將戰時中立法案延長期間呢？還是取消該案加入戰事漩渦呢？余曰此卽是所謂外交手段之一也，若至該案期滿之後，意阿之成為戰爭和不成為戰爭，　然早已確定，但其時意阿戰爭的情形，勝負之誰屬，已可預料，卽國際間推移之形勢，亦已可見一斑，故到戰時中立法案期滿之時，必發生另外一種嚴重的空氣，若到此時，卽使美國並不加入戰團，而其時發言，亦必有特殊的力量，這是美國一貫的政策，其妙處卽在於短字。</p>
<p>若翻轉言之，假令戰時中立法案訂得過長，萬一時機已至，有加入戰必要，或者出來有作武裝調人的必要，其時不免為戰時中立法案所束縛，參加，這樣坐失時機，未免可惜，所謂長袖善舞，多錢善賈，美國在地位上旣處優勢，而又是金元之王國，宜乎其政策發動之奧妙也。</p>
<p>語曰，千金之子，坐不垂堂，知命者不立乎巖墻之下，美國之審愼周詳，處事穩健，其以此乎。</p>
<h3>明月灣</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>「歸雲洞口雲千疊，明月灣頭月一輪。」</p>
<p>每次當我讀到石公山歸雲洞口懸着的那副對聯的時候，便會不期然的想起那明月灣來。因為那對上雖祇是寥寥十四個字，然而已把歸雲洞和明月灣的風景姿態活躍地蘊藏在字裏行間了。我愛那副對，更愛明日灣和歸雲洞的風景，但同時亦深深地佩服那寫對人的妙筆和天才，要是沒有他這副對來提示，我們也許對這風景的印像不會有這樣深刻的。</p>
<p>明月灣雖則也是小小的一角鄉村，但它却具有別處所沒有的風景：像圖畫般的村廓，如夢幻般的環境。村人三三兩兩的散居着，幾乎找不出一家是昆連的。如果有一個陌生人跑進那個村子裏去，一定會疑心村裏沒有人居住的；但是同時給村人發現了村莊裏一旦走進了一個陌生人的時候，他們也要感到意外似的互相猜疑，和不安。因為那裏文化閉塞，智識落伍，和現時代至少要隔去一個世紀；不過那兒生活的樸素，民情的敦厚，却值得頌讚的，然而那裏的風景却美在靜而不在動，它一年四季都有不同的景緻來貢獻給人們欣賞。</p>
<p>在那要，有巒峯疊翠的崇嶺，有巖壑壁立的石崖，有淺草如茵的山坡，有波平如鏡的河蕩，有淸流琤琮的溪澗。有葱籠蒼翠的森林，有波濤洶湧的太湖一角，有……它眞如少女般的美麗，處子般的靜趣；假使有一位詩人或藝術家住這裏的話，我相信他的天才一定更奇妙，他的作品一定更淸新，而他的成功一定更偉大了。可惜我不是個詩人，也不是藝術家，所以不能將它的好處描摹其萬一出來。</p>
<p>不過，我時常自己想，如其我有一天能够脫離都市生活而永遠回到鄉村裏來居住的時候，那我應該要建四處草屋，分為四季居住；卽：春天住林屋山，夏天在消夏灣，秋天當然到這裏來，而冬天最好住在毛公塢裏。因為那四處的風景不但各各相宜，而且氣候環境也是隨時隨地不同的；林屋山，春天可以步春郊，和上百花臺去看百花兢放，傍晚時分還好玩賞晚烟中的景緻。消夏灣是避暑勝地，那兒旣好遊荷蕩，聽漁歌，也可賞蓮花，吃鮮菱。講到明月灣，自然最宜於靜夜步月，日賞秋色。至於毛公塢，那裏積雪是有名的，住在這裏觀雪是最好沒有的了。</p>
<p>所恨我自己天天在生活途上忽忙的奔波，不但沒有機會實現這個夢想，並且也很少時間能够舊地重來，所以一別三年，到如今纔得借便到這裏來跑了一趟。但我這次的來到這裏，起初本打算住三天就走的，可是終於因了那年邁的姑母的殷懃挽留，所以意外地給我多逗遛了幾天。「雨過山峯綠，日落波光紅」，現在風景雖然依舊，但我今年的游興却並不像往年一樣的濃厚了。</p>
<p>現在我對於這裏第一個威到不快的最壞印象是：去年這裏受旱災的影響委實太利害了，田土龜裂得彷彿似縱橫的深溝，菓樹大半全給乾枯以死了！然而今年却又來了這樣」回大水，一望無際的田畦全變了汪洋大海，禾苗盡澹，秋收無望，農民是終日蹙額鎖眉的憂愁着，叫苦之聲幾不絕於耳，有些鄕民到山上去採些柴栗子來充饑，也有吃荳餅（喂猪或壅地的）的，甚至餓上三四天而不得粒食的也是很多，尤其近來，聽說為了沒有飯吃而自殺的，也時有所聞了。我目覩了這樣的慘悽情形，心中眞覺得有些難過，可是我雖然同情他們，但又沒有能力可以去帮助他們，救濟他們，自己常常捧了白米飯嚥不下去，而替他們垂淚</p>
<p>據這裏的鄉民告訴我說：「農人因收成無着而餓肚子，那是極平常的事，莊稼人本來是靠天吃飯，做一天活一天，收一年吃一年的，現在年歲旣然荒到這般田地，而且又一年旱荒一年大水的鬧個不休，叫我們還有什麽好做？那餓肚子自然是免不了的。不過最可惡的要算那些催征吏和地主們，儘這樣如狼似虎的倚勢壓人，正不容易對付。他們明知你今年一些兒都沒有收着，但他們却照常的催逼，任你賣兒鬻女都得設法繳償的，遲一刻兒，就送官辦你，這種橫行無道，暗無天日的日子，叫鄕下人怎樣好過……」</p>
<p>當我悄悄地離開那明月灣的時侯，許多印象旱荒和水災的怵良驚心，鄕民的饑餓與死亡，地主和催征吏的可惡…：都不停地在我腦膜上閃映！</p>
<p>呵！從前我認為世外桃源之一的明月灣，現在也成了人間地獄了！</p>
<h3>橋</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>——五月雨裏，遮不住的啄，瀨田的橋。</p>
<p>這是日本芭蕉先生描狀烟雨中的瀨出的唐橋的有名的俳句。日本我沒有到過，黃梅雨中的瀨田眞景到底如何，無從憶想出來。只是，當我以一個恬然的閑靜的心情讀味着這句詩時，腦幕上可彷彿浮現出一個烟雨空濛的瀨田畫景。一陣輕雨，一陣霧烟，輕盈的飛過去，飛過去，那兒隱隱約約架着一座沉默的古色斑駁的橋。</p>
<p>自然，這一幕瀨田畫景的幻現，只能說是完全中國情調化約。然而，為這句詩挑動起來的情感的感受，要說是芭焦先生藝術的成功，無寗說是緣因於自已一向對于橋的情感先有着很濃厚的粘着爲切當些。書我讀得很少，有沒有人也用他巧妙的散文筆調去描狀橋的風趣，我無從知道；也許古人的詩詞中很有不少取摘橋的風趣溶入詩情中去的。紅樓夢上實琴與衆姐妹聯句中有句「吟鞭指灞橋』，就是我百吟不厭的，不特聲調柔美之至，她簡直狀出一幅灞橋的畫景，給人挑醒藏在情緒中的灞橋的劣史氣氛。讀着這樣的詩句，能不為之戚動麽。</p>
<p>在國人的繪畫上，橋是不會為畫人遺落的，雖然它始終屈居于配景之例，很少作為主題的描寫；但是，在林舍山澗之間配上一架古樸的木橋，那幅淡墨畫可更能襯出一種諧和完美的情趣來的。在今日看來，這類繪畫雖不免被譏為與現代人的生活情調相鑿柄，不過我現在所提及的是只止限于橋的話題，原不牽及到畫的題材上去。就今日的名湖勝地，溪澗水樹之間也總不會缺少路流拱立的橋的，橋之存在于這類地方，也决然非純為風雅之士的「趣味」；牠之存在原為交通上的實用的意義；倒是有橋的美的風趣，纔有風雅之士的流連唱歡共間。這樣說來也許不太過分的。無錫太湖的七十二洞，橫跨珠江的大鐵橋，給人以建築工程的雄偉壯麗之讚歎外，難道還會破壞湖山名市的固有美點麽？一座白渡橋，就增加黃浦灘不少美觀。我相信，假使有人坐在一隻小舟上，由蘇州河穿橋出去：前面江流在望，橋上車輛來往馳突，震聲隆然。他當能更面接的看到都市動律的雄美與急激，而感到自己的渺，小好似自身的靈魂，智力，都令給這雄大的都市的動態呑噬了去。</p>
<p>都市里的橋，自然全染上了都市的粉飾，有壯約雄偉的外貌，失了古樸諧協的靜之美，都不能與鄉村的木樹或古式的泥石堆築的拱橋相提幷論的。我愛好的橋，不是前者，而是水樹之間的十足鄉村情調的橋，遠觀近臨，天晴風雨，晌午日暮，都各有風趣洋溢其間，决不會因風雨晦明，或行人畜牧雜沓其間破壞無遺。芭蕉先生筆下的漱田的橋，我敢斷它是位在富于鄉村情調的所在的古式的橋，至多也只能說與西子湖　西泠橋相彷彿。不然，是决沒有那種　和，柔美，恍惚的情感組織在詩韻里的。</p>
<h3>醫院門前</h3>
<p>— 江敉</p>
<h3>節</h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>凉味的風從遼遠的天邊飄來，掠過曠野，掠過城市，掠過都會，從人們的心上，吹去了一些什麽東西，又帶來了一些什麽東西…</p>
<p>接着，阻當不住地，秋天，像一顆炸彈那麼地擲過來了，把暑天的狂熱轟炸開去，而人們，也緩緩地淸醒過來了：那兒是一片高而淸淡的天空，樹葉颯颯地落下，月亮是寒味的，人的心情是衰老的：此外，便還有什麽呢？</p>
<p>難道還不是沈若得使人害怕的秋天嗎？</p>
<p>（而秋天却把它那灰暗的影子，與魔鬼一樣的黑色的身軀，偸偸地潛進了都會的街。</p>
<p>街上，人來往着是顯得多忽忙而慌亂啊。秋天的風是陰慘的，它儘拍着那飄蕩在半空的，商店與百貨公司的秋季大减價的雜亂的旗幟，想對它們懷着一種仇恨的心理，决意要那些繽紛的旗子打破似的。玻璃窗是眩目而動人的：新秋衣料，各色禮品，肯眞秀蘭鄧波兒洋囝囝，每隻大廉價洋二十三元…）</p>
<p>瞧着這世界：變態的，迷亂的，凋殘的，沒落的，一切祇是一個醜惡的肥皂泡一樣的！</p>
<p>而踉着街上飄着的「良鄕栗子」的焦味，許多人，開始憂愁起來，開始慌亂起來了。</p>
<p>（中秋月餅，中秋月餅，中秋月餅！）</p>
<p>前面是一個節：一介小市民層的難關！</p>
<p>「中秋」，是那麼一個可怕的名詞呀，在這兒已經不再有美妙的明月的影子，有的僅是一些可怕的印像了：賬單，欵子，凋零的市面…</p>
<p>用奇怪的心情（伴着憂急，仇恨的）向這紛雜的都會看：一千種的疑問在心頭騰起了，那些全是不可解的：在那些年紅燈與輝煌的窗飾下面，所隱藏的本質，究竟是一些什麽呢？</p>
<p>莫名其妙地走在街上，節的影像所給予人的　憂是太大了：人從停歇了的店舖裏走了出來，背着家，背若沈重的生活，不敢多想地一天一天的活着過去，可已經是不容易了啊！現在，在這年頭，節像魔鬼似的又站在人們的前面了！這可不是玩的，這是一個值得人們煎沸了心臟一樣去籌思與奔走的日子啊！</p>
<p>（中秋夜的月亮也許是十分皎潔而明澈的吧？然而，有誰再有那種適宣於欣賞的心情呢？）</p>
<p>有多少人哪，疲乏而衰弱的，且從生活的艱苦上獲得了星星的白髮與多縐紋的臉的，從不好的年頭中失掉了生活的依憑，於是，在這「月兒正四」的「好時節」來臨的時候，却得帶着一顆沸滾的心，在風裏雨裏去奔走，去商借，云</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>看另外一些人的不很好受的嘴臉，去受商店收賬員的辱駡，去偸拾一點生活的殘片。</p>
<p>「是什麼世界呀！那麽艱苦的年頭，年紀也活得多了，活够了，這日子可不容易對付啊！」</p>
<p>（想到小時候的興高彩烈的吃月餅的中秋節的情景：可是這日子是永遠地過去的了）。</p>
<p>街是依舊那麽的熱閙啊，行人是像螞蟻一般地亂擠，也許是在焦急着這可怕的節景吧！可是店舖的門前，縱然有幾家貼上了封條，却依舊是輝煌的，收音機帶着啞的聲調在嘶叫一些不可知的話語：夜晚，一個將圓的月亮高掛在天空；她吿訴着人：前面有一個艱難的『節」！</p>
<p>是秋天，是秋天月圓的時候了。</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>銀色新筆</h3>
<p>— 云爾</p>
<p>水災遊藝會的「花選」「舞選」之外的十大明星選舉，各報所談的已經很多了，照一般的意見，都以為與其選舉什麼十大明星，遠不如選舉十大名片來得得當而有意義。</p>
<p>反對的理由是很多的，例如把明星和舞女妓女放在一起，不免有些「那個」，便是一例。</p>
<p>日前，為了「星選」問題，水災遊藝會在大西洋邀請女明星，（為了賑災，而很闊氣的在大西洋請客，說起來真有點兒啼笑皆非。）可是據說女明星出席的很少，「明星」的明星更沒有一個出席的，因之「星選」前途，便很難樂觀，因為要是選出了之後，明星們來個不接受，那如何了得？</p>
<p>明星們的不出席，如果丟開了「水災」的高帽子不談，那是很值得稱讚的，而即使以「水災」來談吧，除了給人選舉之外，明星們也儘有許多方法可以為災民們造福的。（譬如由各影片公司聯合發起一個遊藝會等）那麼，何以還不順水推舟的來個十大名片選舉呢？</p>
<h3>四姊妹</h3>

<h3>感到電影興趣後</h3>
<p>— 童月娟</p>
<p>我是遇着舞台生活的，粉墨登場，創演故事，覺得有些厭倦了。閒來瞧看電影，漸漸感到電影的興趣，這也許見異思遷，是常人的慣例？</p>
<p>演舞台劇，是完全演給他人瞧賞，演電影劇，卻可自己坐在電影院裏，很閒適地看自己的動作，那是多麼得意呀，</p>
<p>新華影業公司的「紅羊豪俠傳」，是我獻身銀幕的第一步工作，那是嘗試性質，現今繼續着在「桃花扇」中飾着蘇蘭階一角，還是要期望着嚴正的批評和指教，那是我很虛心受領的。</p>
<p>從舞台躍登銀幕，第一困難點，就是舞台上一抬腕·一舉足，都有刻版的架式，是不能改變的，電影的動作，卻須自然，須合情理，和舞台上的表演，截然不同，但是我揣摩了幾個月，已把這一層困難，輕輕的打破，從此就努力地奏着前進曲，諒沒有什麼阻礙了罷。（新華來稿）</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Reports on Fen et al.'s Inspection of the Disaster in Xu, Arriving in Ji'ning to Survey the Damage, Extend Condolences and Give Instructions to the Victims, and Inspect the Water Situation South of Zhao Village, Departing from Ji'ning That Evening and Expected to Return to Beijing Today</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Kong Xiangxi, in order to inspect the water situation in Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, this morning at 7:00, accompanied by Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Commission; Yan Zhuang, Supervisor; Chen Mingge, Chairman of the Jinpu Railway Committee; and Tang Xianglu, representative of Shandong, and Li Wenzhi, Party Committee member, arrived in Xuzhou from Beijing by special train. Shao Hanyuan, along with leaders from various sectors and the Yellow River Defense Committee, welcomed Kong at the station. After meeting with representatives from various sectors, they went with Shao to the Xuzhou branch of the Central Bank to rest and inquired in detail about the Yellow River defense and the disaster situation. At 10:00, they headed north on the same train, with Shao Hanyuan accompanying them. Lu and Han were waiting in Yan Prefecture. Kong is scheduled to transfer to Ji'ning for inspection after arriving in Yan Prefecture and return to Beijing tomorrow evening to convene the Economic Commission to discuss all Yellow River defense issues. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today at 2:00 PM, Kong Xiangxi, Qin Fen, Zheng Zhaojing, Shao Hanyuan, Li Wenzhi, Tang Xiang and others arrived in Yan Prefecture by special train. A grand welcome ceremony was held at the station. Kong and others got off the train and rested at the Jinde Association. At 5:00 PM, they arrived in Ji'ning, got off the train and entered a straw shed for disaster victims at the station to inquire about the flood situation. They asked if the river had breached its banks before. The disaster victims replied that it had breached 60 years ago. Then, Kong gave instructions to the disaster victims, saying that the catastrophic disaster was very serious and that the central government officials were very concerned, but they were too busy to come and sent him as their representative, and Chairman Han to provide relief to the disaster victims. He said that the central government would take care of their food, clothing, and shelter, and that when the water receded and they returned home, they should pay attention to river defense. He then cited a Western proverb: "God helps those who help themselves", meaning that they should not wait for others to help them. He also said the Yangtze River flood occurred twice in four years, and once in sixty years, which was not acceptable. Seeing that everyone was in great distress, he said that they should save themselves and not blame the government, cooperate with the government, obey orders, and pay attention to hygiene. He said that Chairman Han had soldiers to fight bandits, but not microorganisms. Then, they went to the canal bank. The disaster victims repeatedly requested that the breach be blocked and disaster relief be provided. So, they took a boat south to inspect south of Zhao Village, got off the boat to observe, and saw water everywhere. At 7:00 PM, they returned to the station and went back to Yanzhou. Kong told reporters that the disaster in Shandong was more serious than expected, and that Chairman Han was able to lead and rescue the disaster victims in difficult circumstances, which proved that there was progress in Chinese politics. However, the Yellow River management methods were not thorough, and breaches were inevitable every year. The central water conservancy agencies were not unified before, but in the future, the Economic Commission would be responsible for cooperating with the provincial governments to definitely have a good long-term solution for water conservancy in the short term, because the flood was not only a local disaster, but also had a major impact on the entire national political, economic, social, and people's safety. But it was not only the government's business, but also the people's responsibility to cooperate with the government. In the past, when the Yellow River breached its banks, the River Conservancy Governor was sentenced to death. (4th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Water Level in Northern Tongzhou Continues to Rise; The Chedaokou Breach is Firmly Blocked; Pixian County is Surrounded by Water; The Western Embankment of Weishan Lake Has Not Yet Been Breached</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level in Northern Tongzhou continues to rise. Fortunately, the breach at Chedaokou has been firmly blocked, and the water is temporarily prevented from encroaching south. However, the Wutun River mouth in Xitao has been breached, and Wang Gong is supervising civilians to build an outer embankment to contain the water and stop the flooding. After the Southern Embankment downstream of the Bulao River in the east section was breached, the water flowed into Pixian County, which is currently trying to intercept and block it. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The water level rose by 3 centimeters, measuring 3.6817 meters. According to a telegram from Qin Jie, the magistrate of Pixian County, to the flood control office, the county, except for the county seat, is submerged, as if sinking into the land. In addition, the Qianji Old Area on the east bank of Liutang in Shujing County is often flooded. The Xiwu Gate has now been blocked to prevent any eventuality. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today's investigation of the Yan Canal's Liutang Sanhe found that the river water has a strong musty smell. It was learned that this was caused by the people of Shandong digging dikes and breaching embankments in Pixian County. Moreover, the water in Yan Liutang has risen sharply, and the water level above the first, second, and third sluices of the wrapping transport is also level with the channel. Farmers along the river are rushing to harvest autumn crops. All of this is enough to prove that the main flow of the Yellow River is not far from entering the wrapping transport period. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A telegram from Pei County reported that a strong east wind blew last night, and the waves impacted the embankment. The embankment bodies in places such as Huzhai and Xiewo were all in critical condition. When the breach at Jizhuang occurred, Yang Guozhen, the magistrate of Pei County, and Yu Keyu, the section chief stationed in Pei County by the Special Commissioner's Office, supervised the civilians to rush to protect it, and there was no danger. The current situation is still tense. The Pei County Yellow River Defense Association has been fully mobilized and dispatched, and 5,000 hemp bags have been purchased in Xuzhou and are being used to rush to block and defend the area day and night. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) In recent days, the southeast wind has been strong, and the waves have been fierce, impacting the western embankment of Weishan Lake. When the breach at Jizhuang occurred, officials and civilians rushed to block it, and fortunately, there was no danger. The current situation is still tense.

Inspectors Zhu Changan and others have been sent to lead civilians to rush to protect it. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today's breach blockage meeting decided to dig a diversion canal at the Dongzhuang breach, 6.5 kilometers long and 100 meters wide, with an estimated cost of 1 million yuan. Also, the Huanghuasi people's levee will be excavated to release water into the main river. In addition, the Zhukou breach will be repaired and protected, and the Jiangsu dam will be thrown for protection. Today, Li Yizhi arrived in Jinan and still advocated digging the Juancheng people's levee to release water into the river channel, returning to the main river from Huanghuasi. However, the people in several counties within the channel are firmly opposed and their feelings are agitated. They have now sent representatives to visit Kong Xiangxi to petition. (4th dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Exact Amount of Funds Needed for Fundamental Solutions to River Management is Still Difficult to Estimate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government's complete plan for managing rivers is now in the hands of the Economic Commission to draft implementation measures.

<p>(Nanjing) The plan for addressing both the symptoms and root causes of river floods, passed by the Executive Yuan, was reported to the Central Political Council on the morning of the 4th. The complete technical design and precise budget for the plan will be the responsibility of the Economic Commission. The financing will still be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Kong's plan estimates that the cost of treating the symptoms of river floods will be 12.5 million yuan. In addition to the 5 million yuan subsidized by the central government from the funds stopped for salary increases and promotions for railroads, postal services, customs, and postal services this year, 1.5 million yuan will be raised from the Hubei levee funds. The remaining 6 million yuan will be shared by Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui, with each province contributing 3 million yuan. Kong's plan did not include funds for treating the root causes. Before the technical design and budget are determined, it is temporarily impossible to estimate.

<p>(Nanjing) Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu telegraphed to Beijing again, stating that the disaster situation in Western Shandong was severe, with millions of disaster victims. Although emergency relief has been released and arrangements have been made as much as possible, the financial resources are limited. Without a large amount of funds allocated by the central government, it will be impossible to provide relief.

<h3>The Roman Pope Mediates the Italian-Ethiopian Dispute</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>After British Government League of Nations Affairs Minister Eden had a hurried meeting in Paris with French Prime Minister Laval, he immediately traveled with Laval by train to Geneva to attend an important meeting of the League of Nations Council. Whether the East African crisis, which is imminent, can be salvaged through diplomatic means will be the final test at this meeting. During this critical period, the peace movement has swept the globe. In Northern Europe, the foreign ministers of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, which have rarely been involved in European affairs, recently issued a joint declaration in the Norwegian capital supporting the League of Nations. The foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries of Czechoslovakia and Romania also expressed the same view. The Prime Minister of the Australian Federation and Canada have decided to support Britain's peace mediation policy. The Labor Party in Britain and the Socialist Parties in France and Belgium have even strongly advocated the implementation of sanctions. Recently, the Roman Pope's personal mediation has been particularly noteworthy. People around the world have gathered immense power, seeking to reverse the will of just one person. Mussolini can be proud of himself even if he does not achieve great success in faraway lands.</p>
<p>What effect will the Roman Pope's intervention have? Let us explore the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and Italy. The Roman Catholic Church, also known as the Vatican, is a small city with an area of 100 acres and a population of 600. It severed relations with Italy because the Italian government confiscated the Pope's land in 1870. During the European War, Pope Benedict XV guided the Catholics of the warring countries with a neutral attitude and gained a good reputation. After the end of the war, its position became more prominent. France and Portugal first restored diplomatic relations, and Britain later sent envoys to the Holy See. The Paris Peace Conference also solemnly guaranteed the inviolable mission of certain Christian missionaries to preach. After the success of the Fascist Revolution in Italy, Mussolini wanted to normalize relations with the Holy See, which had lasted for more than 50 years, and began negotiations with Pope Pius XI in 1926. The agreement was reached in 1929. The Roman Catholic Church then recognized Italy, and Italy also recognized the sovereignty of the Vatican. Mussolini's compromise with the Pope was often valued by the world. However, since then, Fascism and Christian doctrine have often clashed. The most prominent example is the oath issue in Italy. The Fascist government stipulated that all children in the country must swear an oath at the age of fourteen to absolutely obey Prime Minister Mussolini's orders and to vigorously implement the Fascist Revolution, even if it meant bloodshed. The Pope strongly opposed this, saying that "the Fascist Revolution has alienated young people from Jesus Christ and instilled in them ideas of hatred, violence, and disrespect. This oath is illegal." Given the fundamental ideological conflict between the Holy See and the Fascist government, can Mussolini accept the Pope's mediation this time? However, we still remember that during the European War, the authorities of the warring countries felt deeply troubled because the Catholics and the working class had an anti-war attitude. Now that the Roman Pope has made a clear statement on the Italian-Ethiopian situation in support of peace, it will at least have a significant impact on the minds of Catholics in Europe. Considering Mussolini's attention to this move, it is conceivable that it may contribute to a portion of Italians opposing the war. In short, the Roman Pope's actions this time cannot be said to be an important factor in the peace movement.</p>

<h3>The Time for Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation is Still Far Away</h3>

Inquiring from related parties revealed that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, if based on the standard of balance and mutual benefit, would be beneficial to both parties. However, the time for implementation is still far away. The reports in foreign newspapers are all speculations. (4th dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Acting Foreign Minister Wang arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Shenshi (3-5 PM) on the 4th to preside over a ministry affairs meeting. A reporter visited and was received by Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren. The reporter asked, "Foreign newspapers are speculating about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. What is the actual situation and what are our views on this issue?" Tang replied, "Most of the reports in foreign newspapers are speculations and cannot be trusted. However, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, if based on the standard of equality and mutual benefit, will be beneficial and harmless to both parties." The reporter continued to ask whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had heard anything about the Hebei Economic Association holding several meetings to prepare for cooperation and the Japanese Shimizu's participation. Tang replied, "Our people in the association, such as Zhou Zuomin, are all well-known figures in the Northern economic circles, and their purpose is certainly pure. As for whether there are any Japanese participating, I have not received a report and do not know." The reporter then asked whether China was prepared to propose any proposals to the 16th League of Nations Assembly, which was about to open, and what the public's hopes were for China's election as a permanent council member. He also asked whether Ambassadors Yan and Guo had telegraphed the ministry to report on the progress. Tang replied, "We have no important proposals for this League of Nations Assembly. As for the progress of the permanent council election, the ambassadors stationed in Europe have reported on some aspects, but the results are still difficult to predict at this time."

On the way to Anhui, he will meet with Liu Zhenhua to discuss everything. Zhang hosted a banquet for Ju Zheng and Shi Ying, members of the Hubei Disaster Relief Committee in Beijing, on the 4th to discuss relief matters. According to Zhang's remarks to reporters on the 4th, the flood in Hubei this year is the most devastating, more severe than the flood in the year of the Republic of China. Fortunately, the whole country is working together to provide relief, and overseas Chinese are also remitting funds from various sources, which is a blessing for the disaster victims. The central government has previously allocated huge sums of money to provide emergency relief for the Hubei disaster. However, due to the remote location of the disaster area, the funds are insufficient to solve the problem, and a comprehensive plan is needed to alleviate the huge difficulties. Minister of Finance Kong is now aware that the Yangtze River has been hit by two major floods in four years and that a fundamental solution must be sought. He has decided on the principle of addressing both the symptoms and root causes, and the detailed plans can be drafted and submitted to the central government for approval. In terms of addressing the root causes, the methods include dredging, controlling, returning farmland to lakes, and returning rivers to their original courses. In terms of addressing the symptoms, the methods include resuming work and blocking breaches. If these measures can be implemented quickly, the disaster-stricken people can not only be saved, but the risk of flooding can also be permanently eliminated. The Central Political Council has now decided on measures for civil servants to donate salaries to disaster relief. In addition, the service personnel of the three ministries of Railways, Communications, and Finance, as well as their affiliated agencies such as the Railway Bureau, the Shipping Bureau, the Telegraph Bureau, the Post Office, the Customs, and the Salt Administration, are also willing to suspend salary increases and promotions this year and use the funds for work relief. It is estimated that a large amount of funds will be raised, and the central government will allocate these funds fairly and appropriately. After Hubei Province receives the disaster relief funds, it will immediately organize work relief. (4th dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Amidst the Emergency of the Italian-Ethiopian Crisis, the League of Nations Council Convenes; Representatives of Britain, France, and Italy Agree on Procedures; First a Closed Meeting, Followed by a Public Meeting; Report on Paris Negotiations Receives French Approval; US Relaxes Atmosphere by Abandoning Oil Rights</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council will hold a closed meeting at 4:00 PM today to decide on the agenda for today, and then immediately follow with a public meeting. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British representative Eden, French representative Laval, and Italian representative Aloisi met this morning for an hour to decide to hold a closed meeting at 4:00 PM this afternoon, to be followed by a public meeting of the League of Nations Council. The report on the Paris tripartite negotiations that Eden intends to submit to the Council has been reviewed by Laval. At the same time, the League of Nations believes that the attitude of the British and American governments has completely eliminated the discussion of the Rickett concession. However, the final decision on canceling the contract is still closely tied to Abyssinia. Everyone feels that no group is willing to risk taking responsibility for carrying out this concession plan. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The countries have reportedly agreed on the procedures for this session of the Council. The Council will first hold a closed meeting, and then a public meeting. At that time, the British Minister Without Portfolio Eden will present a report on the Paris conference, and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will endorse the content of the report. Next, Italian representative Aloisi will explain Italy's position, and finally, the Abyssinian representative will express their views. All of this is a matter of formality, and the content of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute will likely not be discussed in today's meeting. (4th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The mood here has been extremely tense in the past few days. Today, upon hearing that the concession is about to be cancelled, the tension immediately eased. People generally hope that this indication will clear the air for diplomatic talks. Eden and Laval had a long talk this morning, focusing on whether Britain and France should submit the issue of the breakdown of the tripartite conference separately or jointly. It is also highly doubtful whether today's meeting will be open to the public. The closed meeting begins at 4:00 PM this afternoon and may be prolonged. Whether the public meeting can begin immediately will depend on the duration of the closed meeting. (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council originally had 15 member states. Except for Japan and Germany, which have withdrawn from the League of Nations and no longer send representatives to attend, 13 countries are attending this session of the Council. Among them, France, Britain, Italy, and the Soviet Union are permanent members. In addition, the nine countries are non-permanent members. The list of representatives from the 13 countries attending this session is as follows: France: Laval (Prime Minister and Foreign Minister); Britain: Eden (Minister Without Portfolio); Italy: Aloisi; Soviet Union: Litvinov; Czechoslovakia: Beneš (Foreign Minister) or Osuský (Ambassador to France); Mexico: Gómez (Deputy Minister of Finance); Argentina: Quincey; Chile: Vicuña (Ambassador to Italy); Spain: Alwyn; Australia: Bruce (Australian Federal Special Envoy to Britain); Poland: Colonel Beck (Foreign Minister); Denmark: Munch; Turkey: Cemal. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Countries Busily Conferring Outside the Meeting</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After arriving here, British Minister Without Portfolio Eden went to Aix-les-Bains in France to meet with British Prime Minister Baldwin. After returning this morning, he met with French Prime Minister Laval at 9:45 AM to report on the discussions in Aix-les-Bains and discuss the procedures for this afternoon's Council meeting. He then met with Laval and Italian representative Aloisi. In addition, Laval also met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in the morning, and Eden met separately with Portuguese representative to the League of Nations General Assembly, Vascconcellos, Australian representative to the Council meeting, Bruce, and Abyssinian adviser Professor Jèze. The procedures for today's Council meeting will likely begin with the Greek Ambassador to France, Politis, presenting a report as the fifth arbitrator of the Italian-Abyssinian Mixed Arbitration Commission on the ruling of the Commission regarding the Walwal incident. After Politis completes his report, it is not yet known whether the British and French representatives will report on the failure of the Paris tripartite conference, or whether the Italian representative will present documents accusing Abyssinia. What is known is that Eden and Laval will each give a report on the failure of the Paris tripartite conference. Furthermore, Emperor Haile Selassie will briefly explain the solutions recently proposed by Britain to Mussolini (that is, those proposed during the Paris tripartite conference), and Laval will give a longer speech. As far as is generally known, the viewpoints held by the British and French representatives are based on the covenant to seek a solution to mediate and safeguard peace, and there will naturally be no discrepancies. It can be seen from the fact that Eden and Laval discussed the possibility of re-proposing the above solutions during their meeting yesterday. As for the Italian representative Aloisi, he will reiterate the positions that his country has repeatedly expressed in the past at today's meeting. The memorandum submitted by the Italian representative this time accuses Abyssinia is voluminous, no less than two hundred pages, including many photos, which collect all kinds of brutal acts by Abyssinia and the act of selling slaves. In short, no matter how the meeting proceeds today, it will not be hasty. The wishes of the majority of national representatives to complete all formalities in the meeting will certainly be respected. (4th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Arbitration Committee's Resolution Is Irrelevant; It Believes That Neither Italy nor Abyssinia Can Be Blamed for the Walwal Conflict</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Italian-Abyssinian Arbitration and Conciliation Committee, because the League of Nations Council had resolved on August 3 that the committee's mission should not involve the issue of Walwal sovereignty, this actually made it impossible for the committee to make a judgment on right and wrong according to the law. It is reported that the committee therefore made an unexpected, moderate, and irrelevant resolution, that is, neither Italy nor Abyssinia is responsible for any moral or financial responsibility for the Walwal conflict and all subsequent incidents. The committee had decided to deal with the issue based on ascertaining the facts, but nine months have passed since the first incident, and it is difficult to investigate the truth of the day. Moreover, the actions of the Italians in Walwal were colonial in nature, while those of the Abyssinians were national in nature. Since the nature of the two sides is different, neither can be blamed. France believes that the committee's resolution has cleared the haze from the sky, making the Italian-Abyssinian problem easier to resolve peacefully. (3rd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Standard Oil Company Agrees to Abandon Oil Rights Due to Intervention by the State Department; Abyssinia Greatly Disappointed Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Abyssinian oil concession was obtained by the African Colonial Bank, which is an appendage of the Standard Oil Company. The company has decided to abandon the concession at the personal request of Secretary of State Hull. Hull declared, "The United States government finds this concession very difficult, and other governments that are sincerely maintaining peace are also exhausted in dealing with it. Now that Standard Oil has agreed to abandon it, it is a good thing." The details of the matter are as follows: Standard Oil Company Chairman Walton and Vice Chairman Dundas called on Secretary of State Hull to inform him that the Abyssinian oil concession had indeed been obtained by the company. They then met with Murray, Director of the Near East Division of the State Department, and then again met with Hull. Hull declared that the concession is a major obstacle to maintaining peace under the current circumstances, and could have serious implications. Walton and Dundas then returned to New York to consult with important shareholders of the company, and notified the State Department by telephone that they were willing to abandon the concession. The details of the meeting between Hull and Walton and Dundas have now been published in the gazette. It is reported that Walton explained to Secretary of State Hull that Standard Oil Company has been very concerned about Abyssinia's coal mines for twenty years, and has made unremitting efforts. At the beginning of this year, Rickett notified the company executives when he was in London of the possibility of obtaining the concession, and discussed it with them in detail. The company then independently organized the "African Colonial Bank" to prepare to start operations. The company also received a telegram last Friday stating that it had obtained the concession, but the full text of the contract has not yet been sent, and the company has not yet paid any money to the Abyssinian government. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The 75-year concession obtained by the African Colonial Company to exploit oil in Abyssinia will be cancelled due to the intervention of the State Department. The Secretary of State, who has been studying the difficulties arising from this concession and the repercussions that will occur in Geneva and elsewhere in the past few days, announced today that the concession has been cancelled. Hull told reporters that after discussing with officials from Standard Oil Company, the company agreed to abandon the concession so that it could be cancelled. Hull also said that the acquisition of the concession by the African Colonial Company will not change the United States' attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian situation. No matter what the nature of this transaction is, whether commercial or political, the US government's policy on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute will remain the same as before. The US government had no knowledge of the negotiation of this concession. (3rd, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa An official of the Abyssinian government said that the news of the United States cancelling the concession obtained by Rickett was very disappointing. It is incomprehensible that the right could be cancelled less than a week after the contract was signed. It is heard that there is no provision for cancellation in the contract.

<h3>Abyssinian Government Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Oil Concession Helps Develop Resources; Not Bound by 1906 Treaty</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The Abyssinian government has issued a communiqué regarding the Rickett oil concession, stating that "The Abyssinian government grants oil exploration concessions entirely based on Abyssinia's independent sovereignty. This concession is purely economic in nature and helps develop Abyssinia's resources. The policy of the Abyssinian government has always been sincere in its intention to attract experts and financiers from various countries to develop its vast territory. Since this policy is impartial, the Abyssinian government will never change it." Regarding external rumors that this move violates the 1906 Tripartite Treaty, "The Abyssinian government did not sign the 1906 treaty and is therefore not bound by it. This was stated in the Abyssinian government's letter to the then League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on August 7, 1926. Although the 1906 treaty delineated Italy's sphere of influence and was recognized by Britain, Abyssinia is not bound by this decision. Moreover, the 1906 treaty stipulates that the signatory countries guarantee the territorial integrity of Abyssinia. Now that Italy is openly violating this promise, the treaty has actually lost its effect. As for the British government, it has nothing to do with this concession, because it is purely American capital." (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Statement by the Abyssinian Ambassador to Britain</h3>
<p>(London) Abyssinian Ambassador to Britain, Dr. Martin, delivered a speech at the Nile Association today, stating, "If we can be given twenty years of peace and a loan of twenty million pounds to build schools and develop resources throughout Abyssinia, then I dare to guarantee that Abyssinian civilization will be no worse than that of other countries. Moreover, the working masses of Italy are more in need of liberation than the slaves of Abyssinia, because Abyssinian slaves can now freely express their opinions, and if they are mistreated by their masters, they can demand that their masters be punished, which is not the case for the working masses of Italy. As for the claim that Italian colonies are threatened by Abyssinia, it is even more absurd. Britain and France have always respected our independence and territorial integrity, but Italy has always tried to encroach on Abyssinian territory. The facts are there, and there is no need to argue. Abyssinian law treats commercial and industrial concessions equally, regardless of nationality. The fact that Italian nationals have obtained important concessions to mine gold in Abyssinia is clear proof." Dr. Martin finally believes that if war breaks out between Italy and Abyssinia, Abyssinia can win independently. He particularly does not want other countries to be drawn into the vortex of war. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Will Be Hit in the League of Nations</h3>
<p>British Government Orders Ambassadors to Inquire in Detail; Opposition Party Will Use This as an Attack Tool</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources believe that the government has instructed Sir Barton, the ambassador to Abyssinia, to: (1) Personally inquire with the Emperor of Abyssinia about the total amount of capital in the oil concession and the names of investors; (2) Urge the Emperor to pay attention to the fact that the signing of this concession will be detrimental to Abyssinia's position in Geneva, because after the signing of this concession, it will be more difficult to reach a compromise with Italy on an economic basis. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures believe that the Rickett oil concession incident is a serious blow to Britain's position in Geneva, because Britain demands that if the League of Nations covenant is violated, Article 16 of the covenant should be invoked to implement sanctions. Now that there is the Rickett concession, it is doubtful whether such sanctions can still be proposed. It is generally believed that if the Abyssinian Emperor cannot stop the effect of this concession, Britain will no longer take a strong stance in the League of Nations. Moreover, although it is credible that the British government knew nothing about the Rickett concession beforehand, the opposition party will inevitably use this matter as a weapon to attack the government in the next general election, leaving the government speechless. Political figures have not been able to conceal this. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to observations by financial figures, the British financial group has no relationship with the Rickett oil concession. If the Treasury continues to investigate thoroughly, it will be able to ascertain that there is private British investment in this concession, but the name of the investor is unknown. Financial figures also said that if the Central Gold Mine Company is not fully invested in this concession, it should at least have some shares in it. In addition, the report from New York to the London banking community is very noteworthy. The report states that the founders of the African Colonial Company (that is, the company that signed the contract with the Abyssinian government to obtain the oil concession), Weissrub and Britton, are directors of the Fordon Company, and the Fordon headquarters are located in London. In this case, there is no doubt that this investment is related to London. It has also been said that the African Colonial Company was originally dedicated to absorbing European capital and registered in the United States. Although these rumors may not reduce the credibility of the British government, British officials have become even more uneasy because of this. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Concludes Draft Agreement with American Merchant</h3>
<p>Surrendering Gold Mining Rights in Exchange for Loan; This Matter Is Not Related to Standard Oil Company</p>
<p>(New York) American merchant Chick today stated that he had concluded a draft agreement with Abyssinian Ambassador to Britain, Martin, that if he could raise a loan of one million US dollars for Abyssinia within ninety days from July 19, Abyssinia would surrender the property rights of gold, platinum, and other minerals within its territory to Chick for a period of fifty years. Chick said that he had a considerable source for the loan, so he intended to fulfill this draft agreement. Chick did not want to disclose the name of the financial group, but said it was well-known, and at the same time firmly stated that it had nothing to do with Standard Oil.

<h3>Abyssinia Actively Prepares for War; Busy Mobilizing Troops and Procuring Armaments; Vows to Resist to the End If Invaded</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa According to news from various ministries across the country, Abyssinia's mobilization and war preparations have been progressing vigorously in the past few weeks. Abyssinian Grand Guard Mikael will go to Harar tomorrow to take command of about 10,000 troops. At the same time, the authorities are now ordering armaments from all directions, including a battery of artillery worth £20,000 from a factory in Switzerland, and cannons, gas masks, tents, etc. worth $50,000 from the United States, and field glasses and telescopes from a factory in the Netherlands. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian Emperor told a reporter from a newspaper that he deeply thanked the British and French governments for their efforts to reconcile, and was also very pleased with the public opinion of the two countries that was favorable to Abyssinia. He also said that Abyssinia does not threaten others, but is dedicated to maintaining peace, but if its territory is invaded, it will resist to the end even if only a soldier is left. (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The Abyssinian Emperor appointed Mikael as Governor of Koro and Commander of the garrison there. Mikael had recruited 12,000 troops near the Eritrean border at the end of July, and is now ordered to continue recruiting. These troops are ordered to temporarily station at stations along the railway, so that 16,000 troops will be available for deployment in a few days. All of these troops will be concentrated in Walwal, and some will be equipped with machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital One thousand soldiers here set out for Walwal this morning. The time and destination of the departure were kept secret in advance. The soldiers wore white uniforms, carried guns, and carried shields made of animal skins and bullets on their waists. Before departure, well-wishers lined up for half a kilometer. Women and children went to see them off, and began to cry in tears after the soldiers left. It is reported that 10,000 soldiers had already set out for Walwal in the past few days, and more soldiers will continue to depart tomorrow. (3rd, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The people of the Danakil tribe are still fleeing to the villages near Dire Dawa one after another. Although Rome is making every effort to deny the claim that Italian troops have crossed the Eritrean border into Abyssinian territory, this rumor is still spreading everywhere. The people of Dire Dawa are quite shocked. Many residents have moved to Djibouti in French Somaliland. No region is more enthusiastic about the war than Tigray. There is a man named Haile Selassie there, who commands an army of 150,000 to 200,000 men. Haile Selassie's wife is beautiful and brave. Whenever her husband goes elsewhere, she takes over the command of the army. If Italy and Abyssinia go to war in the future, she intends to go to the front line to do her duty. Haile Selassie is now preparing for war, setting up beacons from the front line to a distance of 150 miles behind the lines, and will light fires to warn of enemy arrival.</p>
<p>This method is very convenient, and can enable the non-regular army to be quickly dispatched. (4th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The first batch of Abyssinian troops set off for the Somaliland border today. This mixed army of 500 men waded through the mud next to the railway, competing to throw old and dilapidated guns into the cars in preparation for transport to the front. This army is under the command of Chief Mikael. The chief was a famous general in the Battle of Adwa in 1896, and killed countless Italian troops. It is said that he can gather an army of 20,000 men on the border. It is also a spectacle to see the soldiers, some of whom are still children and some of whom are gray-haired, mixed together and laughing and joking as they wait for the inspection of the officers.

<h3>Italy Tries to Deny: Military Intrusion into Abyssinian Territory; Italian Residents in Abyssinia's Capital Flee</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa, Abyssinia: The Italian Legation in Abyssinia recently issued a statement saying that it knows nothing about the rumor that 1,000 Italian soldiers and over 1,000 other troops had invaded the Tangali tribe on the Abyssinian border. As for the oil and mining concession issue, the Legation has not yet received instructions from the government. In addition, yesterday some people threw stones at the residence of Italian residents near the Legation in Addis Ababa, but there was no anti-Italian demonstration in front of the Legation. The Legation has requested protection from its government, which has agreed to do so. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to Italian sources, an Italian resident named Massiano was attacked and knocked down on the street in Addis Ababa, and stones were thrown at the residence of another Italian resident. Upon hearing this news, the Italian Envoy has notified the Abyssinian government that Italy will not be responsible for any legitimate self-defense measures taken by Italians in the future. According to French sources, Rocqueville, the French manager of the Eastern Africa Company, has been arrested in Jijiga on charges of espionage. The French Consul in Dire Dawa has gone to investigate. Meanwhile, Italian women and children in Abyssinia have all moved elsewhere, and men are also leaving the country one after another, all heading towards Djibouti. (Reuters News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Hayashi Senjuro Resigns: Kawashima Succeeds as Japanese Army Minister; Officially Appointed Today; Aims to Implement Military Rectification</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi has formally submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Okada this morning after measures taken in the wake of the Nagata Incident came to a conclusion. The successor has been decided as General Kawashima Yoshuyuki, a current military councilor. (Dentsu News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 2:30 PM on the 4th, Prime Minister Okada went to Hayama to visit the Emperor, presented Army Minister Hayashi's resignation, and approved General Kawashima's succession as Army Minister. After Prime Minister Okada returned, he met with Chief Chamberlain Suzuki to report the process of the Army Minister's replacement. The inauguration ceremony will be held at 10:00 AM on the 5th. (Dentsu News Agency, 4th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After resigning as Army Minister, Hayashi will be transferred to the position of Army Military Councilor. (Nichi-Ren News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Kawashima Yoshuyuki's Brief History: Non-Partisan; Possesses Political Skills</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Army Minister, General Kawashima, is 58 years old, from Ehime Prefecture, and a graduate of the 10th class of the Military Academy. He has held important positions such as Director of the Personnel Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, Commander of the 19th Division, Commander of the 3rd Division, Director of the Education Headquarters, and Commander of the Korean Army. He was promoted to Army General in Showa 9 (1934) and later transferred to Military Councilor until today. Because he served as the Chief of both Army Affairs and Personnel during General Itagaki's tenure as Army Minister, he is well-versed in military systems, not of lofty character, and has flexible means. However, his health is somewhat unwell, and whether he can overcome today's difficult situation remains questionable. General Kawashima's neutral position within the army will certainly enable him to inherit Army Minister Hayashi's policies and cooperate with the government to solve various problems. (Nichi-Ren News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The unexpectedly appointed new Army Minister, General Kawashima Yoshuyuki, and Ueda, Commander of the West Tokyo Garrison, and the Commander of the Korean Army are from the same class and graduates of the 10th class of the Army Staff College. He is two classes ahead of Army Minister Hayashi and was a top student and sword recipient at the Army Staff College. Since his time as a young officer, General Kawashima's duties have been related to operations and materials, so he has not been very prominent. However, he is a simple person, not very famous and without color. If something important happens, he will immerse himself in hard work. The sudden return to calm of the internal atmosphere that had become sharp for a time after the replacement of Education Director-General Teisu Yi and the occurrence of the Nagata Incident, and the fact that unofficial Army Councilor meetings and Army Commander and Division Commander meetings could proceed so smoothly were due to Army Minister Hayashi's selfless efforts and General Kawashima's tireless work in mediating between the major figures. The fact that Army Minister Hayashi's instructions at the Division Commander meeting received the unanimous opinion of the military leadership was also due to his great efforts. General Kawashima's political skills can be seen from this. However, the General is colorless and transparent, and his true worth is not thorough, so it is feared that he will struggle temporarily. The General is from Ehime Prefecture and has no hobbies other than drinking. (Dentsu News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>New Japanese Army Minister Kawashima</p>
<h3>Presents Conditions for Taking Office</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) General Kawashima met with Prime Minister Okada at 1:30 PM today and reportedly presented the following conditions for taking office as Army Minister: (1) To expand the scope of national defense and promptly realize national defense policies; (2) To thoroughly eliminate the "Emperor Organ Theory"; (3) To realize the minimum necessary army budget to overcome the extraordinary situation. The presentation of conditions upon taking office as Army Minister is something that successive Army Ministers have done, but this time the conditions are quite profound. (Dentsu News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Absolutely No Impact on the Political Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Some are paying close attention to whether General Kawashima's appointment as Army Minister will have an impact on the current political situation. In fact, it is expected that strengthening the army's control with the new Army Minister's skills and moving forward toward military rectification will achieve considerable results. The government is placing great expectations on the new Army Minister Kawashima. However, General Kawashima is rumored to hold fairly strong views on the issue of clarifying the national essence (Kokutai Meicho), so there are concerns about the extent to which the government can achieve coordination on this point. Also, the new Army Minister's attitude in negotiations with the financial authorities when compiling the army budget to be developed in the future is also something that we are paying attention to. However, the intention of the government's top leaders is that the government should continue to work hard on the issue of clarifying the national essence, and it is only natural that the necessary expenses for the next fiscal year's budget compilation should be recognized. Furthermore, observing the current international situation and the situation in Manchuria, it is appropriate to allocate the army budget according to circumstances, so General Kawashima's appointment is unlikely to cause any special changes.

Depositors gathered in front of the door, showing worried expressions. The banking community held a meeting on the evening of the 3rd to discuss relief measures, but no agreement was reached. The reason for the bank's closure is that it has too much property as collateral, and depositors have only been withdrawing in recent years. Someone withdrew hundreds of thousands on the 3rd, and the deposits were exhausted, forcing the suspension of payments. The Guangzhou branch also closed at the same time. The Hong Kong National Commercial Savings Bank was affected by the suspension of payments by the Guangdong Bank, and a bank run occurred on the 4th.

<h3>Repairing the People's Dikes in Hubei Province Requires More Than 4 Million Yuan. The Association Has Allocated 2 Million Yuan to Rush Repair the Xianghe Main Dike. 3.6 Million Yuan Was Spent on Dikes Last Year.</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This summer, floods raged, and many Jiang and Xiang dikes collapsed. Almost all of the Xianghe dike was washed away, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe. Now that the summer flood has passed and the autumn flood is approaching, repairing the dikes is the unanimous request of the local people and an urgent task for flood prevention and disaster relief. The responsible authorities have held repeated meetings on this matter. The main dike will be repaired by the Jiangdi Engineering Bureau, and the people's dikes will be planned by the Flood Relief Association, all through work-for-relief programs to help disaster victims. There are too many people's dikes on both sides of the Jiang and Xiang rivers, and the investigation procedures are quite complicated. A plan has already been formulated, divided into three phases, from October of this year to March of next year, to be completed in full. The work-for-relief funds have also been budgeted, totaling 4.6 million yuan. In addition to the 3 million yuan allocated by the central government for the second time, which will be fully used for labor costs, there is still a shortfall of 1.6 million yuan, which will be raised by the province. The main dike on the Xianghe side will be repaired in advance, and the Association has approved the allocation of 2 million yuan for construction. It is not yet known whether this will be sufficient. Including the Yangtze River side, the total construction funds needed will be around 4 to 5 million yuan. It is found that repairing dikes accounts for the largest part of Hubei Province's expenditure. Not to mention distant years, the funds used in the previous year were already alarming. According to the report of the Dike Engineering Special Fund Management Committee, from July 1, last year, to June 30, this year, the revenue from the dike fund was 4,263,662.36 yuan. Expenditures for engineering, flood prevention, subsidies, and agency expenses were 3,622,247.81 yuan. Unfortunately, when the big dike broke, it was still inevitable to face the catastrophe. A huge amount of money was like throwing it into a bottomless pit. This time, the need for repairs is even greater. It is hoped that those in charge of the project will strive to take remedial measures after the loss and not be hasty again. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Kong and Song Expressed Opinions on Rescuing Hankou's Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Goods Pledge Loans Have Been Ordered to Be Undertaken by the Central Three Banks. Financial Bonds Are All Designated for Use, with No Remaining Balance. Issuing Circulating Notes Has Many Abuses and Must Be Carefully Considered.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hankou's financial situation experienced panic before and after the flood. To seek emergency relief, the Chamber of Commerce formulated three measures. In addition to the first item, which was to have the Central, China, and Communications Banks accept loans on goods pledges, which has been implemented since August, the second item was to request the central government to provide financial bonds of 5 million yuan to rescue Hankou's industry and commerce, following the precedent of rescuing Shanghai's industry and commerce. The third item was to request the issuance of circulating notes, which were submitted to the provincial government and then to the Headquarters for review. Director Zhang Xueliang of the Headquarters, because the matter concerned finance, was not convenient to handle it rashly, and transferred it to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission Song Ziwen for review. Kong and Song recently replied to Director Zhang, expressing their opinions. The main points of the two letters are as follows: (1) Kong Xiangxi's letter stated that the Hankou Chamber of Commerce requested that the Central, China, and Communications Banks of Hankou be instructed to provide merchants with accommodation for goods pledges. The Ministry had previously received telegrams from the Chamber of Commerce and the Hankou Municipal Government, stating "If the pledges submitted are accurate and in line with the regulations of each bank, they should be undertaken to the best of their ability to maintain the market." The Central, China, and Communications Banks were informed by telegram to inform the Hankou branch to comply and reply separately. As for the request of the Chamber to allocate 5 million yuan in public bonds in accordance with Shanghai's measures to rescue industry and commerce, the central treasury is currently short of currency, and the bonds issued have been designated for use, with no remaining balance. This difficulty should be understood by you. If it is intended to issue circulating notes, there will be even more abuses, which are not appropriate. It seems that the Chamber should still follow the previous telegram from the Ministry for convenience. (2) Song Ziwen's letter stated that he had received a suggestion from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce to borrow money from banks with goods as collateral. Those with accurate collateral, secure guarantees, and compliance with the bank's regulations can be jointly pledged to maintain the market. Mayor Wu also telegraphed the Central, China, and Communications Banks about this matter, and they had previously replied. Allocating public bonds, if the Ministry of Finance has a surplus, can be appropriately allocated to benefit the market turnover. As for the circulating note method, it still needs to be carefully considered. I am afraid that after it is realized, the market will be chaotic and there will be more obstacles. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Rumors of the Disappearance of the Chief of the Songjiang Land Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhangqi, the chief of the Land Bureau of this county, is nearly thirty years old, elegant, and from Suzhou. He is very amiable and respected by his friends. He previously served as a section chief under former County Magistrate Shen and had a good relationship with local people. After taking up his current position, he handled land registration and planning in an orderly manner. Recently, due to unsatisfactory matters in official affairs, he felt quite passive. A few days ago, he submitted a request to the Provincial Bureau for four days of leave and went to Shanghai and then to Suzhou to meet his brother. He then returned to Shanghai. Recently, it was learned that a certain staff member of the Bureau received a letter mailed from Shanghai by Chief Zhu, stating that he was going to commit suicide by drowning himself in the sea at Gaoqiao. His family was very alarmed upon hearing the news and took a photo and sent someone to Shanghai to inquire. They also telegraphed his brother to come to Songjiang. The Bureau has also reported the matter to the Provincial Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Lake Bandits Discovered in Yangcheng Lake, Suzhou</h3>
<p>A gang of lake bandits, totaling more than forty people, has recently been discovered in Yangcheng Lake. Late at night on the 2nd, they took a boat to Fumatang Village, Zhengdian Township, and robbed four families, and kidnapped the twelve-year-old son of Zhu Xingsheng. The victim Wang Shouxiang was severely beaten by the bandits because they forced him to reveal where the silver was hidden. According to the investigation, the bandits are still in Yangcheng Lake and have not dispersed. Therefore, each county and township along the lake has been informed to be on strict guard and to search and suppress them.</p>
<h3>Lu Guanzeng Accuses the Jingbao Reporter of Demolition</h3>
<p>Lu Guanzeng, a Suzhou gentleman from Tianguanfang, is the brother of Lu Beici, the former consul in Kobe. Recently, he filed a complaint with the District Court through Lawyer Wu Chao, accusing Wang Zhuxin, the editor of the Wu County Jingbao, of defamation because of the "Big Official Residence" news published in the newspaper, which he believed referred to the Lu family of Tianguanfang. After receiving the complaint, the District Court scheduled a hearing for the plaintiff and defendant at 6 a.m. Wang denied that it referred to the Lu family and also hired Lawyer Ren Daqiang to appear in court to defend him.</p>
<h3>Dongting East Mountain Builds Forts to Prevent Bandits</h3>
<p>Dongting East Mountain in Suzhou Township is located on the shore of Taihu Lake and has always been an area where bandits appear. In order to maintain the peace and security of the people in the villages along the lake, County Magistrate Wu plans to build forts at the Taihu Lake entrance of East Mountain and station troops to prevent lake bandits. Yesterday (the 4th), he sent Nie Dezhao, the deputy commander of the Security Brigade, to East Mountain to inspect the location with Ma Chonglu, the head of the Garrison Engineering Corps stationed in Suzhou. On the 6th, the Engineering Corps will send a platoon of soldiers and the Security Team will send a squad to build a fort at the ferry entrance of East Mountain. Forts will continue to be built in Xukou and other places to maintain rural security.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Meat Industry Resumes Business</h3>
<p>The meat industry in this county unanimously went on strike to oppose the tax on slaughtered pigs. This has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Meat Industry Association, after persuasion by party and government leaders, decided to resume business first, and then convened a general meeting of members to decide to temporarily resume business and wait for a proper solution. Before the two sides have reached a proper agreement, the tax on slaughtered pigs should be temporarily suspended to avoid disputes. If the tax office still disregards everything, it will insist on seeing it through to the end, causing a major disturbance, for which the tax office should be responsible. A letter has been sent to the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the tax office for verification. Yesterday (the 4th) morning, all the meat shops inside and outside the city resumed business and paid taxes as usual. Mao Hezhang, the director of the Tax Collection Office, replied to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying that he was grateful for the Chamber's repeated mediation and that he had instructed the Standing Committee of the Association to be responsible for promptly paying the overdue taxes and to persuade their colleagues to resume business. The County Chamber of Commerce, Qian Sunqing, in order to mediate the dispute, specially invited Mao Hezhang, the director of the Tax Office, and Lu Zongyi and Ren Shuying, the representatives of the Meat Industry Association, to the meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday to hold a mediation meeting. It was decided that the old taxes owed by the meat merchants should be cleared before the Mid-Autumn Festival by the Meat Industry Association. The business of the meat merchants is indeed sluggish. If the overdue taxes can be cleared, the Tax Office will definitely not change the history. In the future, new taxes should still be cleared on a monthly basis. At this point, the two sides agreed and the meeting adjourned. A storm has come to a complete end.</p>
<h3>A Man's Body Found Hanging in Yuncun, Changzhou</h3>
<p>Inside the deserted Eastern Land Temple in Yuncun, the seventh district of Wuyi County, a farmer entered to rest on the morning of the 3rd and found an unidentified man's body hanging. He immediately ran to inform the villagers and reported it to the Luocun Police Station for investigation. Bao Xunken took the case as a matter of human life and, in addition to ordering the police to guard the scene, sent police to the District Prosecutor's Office to request that they go to the countryside for an autopsy. Guan Junjie, the prosecutor of the office, led officials to the countryside for an autopsy on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Silk Reeling Factory Increases Output Daily</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Hangzhou Silk Reeling Factory has increased its silk production since resuming operations. In June, it produced 6,945 dan of silk, and in July, it produced 32,649 dan of silk. The output in August has increased from 2,100 taels to 3,400 taels.

<h3>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Opens to Hengfeng Today</h3>
<p>The track-laying project of the Wangnan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is progressing rapidly. The Yushan to Shangrao section opened to traffic on August 1. It is now learned that the project has extended past Shangrao to the Hengfeng County border, which used to be a bandit area, with desolate surroundings, scarce commerce, and few travelers. Therefore, today (the 5th) it has opened to traffic to Hengfeng Station, but only the engineering train is running with one attached car for the convenience of travelers. It is not officially open for business. The Hengfeng to Yiyang section is expected to be completed and open to traffic by the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Bank: Shanghai Branch Suspends Operations Yesterday; Hong Kong Head Office Telegraphs Reorganization; Payments Temporarily Suspended During Reorganization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Guangdong Bank on Ningbo Road in this city announced a temporary suspension of operations at 9:45 AM yesterday. The bank is a member of the Bankers Association, with its head office located in Hong Kong and registered with the British government. The reason for the suspension is due to the impact of the head office's financial difficulties and suspension of operations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Head Office: Guangdong Bank was established in the first year of the Republic of China and registered under the Hong Kong government's Limited Company Ordinance, with Hong Kong as its head office. Initially, Lu Pengshan raised capital from overseas Chinese in the Americas and jointly planned with Hong Kong merchant Li Huangtang to establish a Chinese-owned bank specializing in all banking businesses. People from all walks of life enthusiastically subscribed for shares, and the bank was established. Its capital was only HK$2 million, but in the tenth year of the Republic of China, it was changed to £1.2 million. By the fifteenth year of the Republic, it was changed again to HK$11 million, entirely Chinese-owned. In addition to branches in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Siam, the bank also had branches in San Francisco, New York, and London. It is also learned that the Chairman of the Board of Directors is Li Huangtang, and the directors are Lu Pengshan, Li Zizhong, Zhong Xifan, Li Wenqi, Li Jingqu, Tan Huantang, Luo Xuhe, Chen Fuxiang, Huang Maolin, Li Baokui, Li Yimei, Wu Zihan, Li Bingchao, Wu Yaoting, and General Manager Lu Pengshan. The bank had previously obtained approval from the British government to issue banknotes, but because the reserve fund had to be fully submitted to the British authorities for safekeeping, making it unprofitable, it gradually withdrew them until they disappeared completely. This happened five years ago.</p>
<p>Announcement of Suspension: Due to the impact of the global economic downturn and the gradual decrease in remittances and deposits from overseas Chinese, the bank experienced financial difficulties and announced the suspension of operations yesterday morning. The Shanghai branch was still operating normally until 9:00 AM yesterday morning, and posted the following announcement: Dear Sirs, We have just received a telegram from our Hong Kong head office stating that due to the impact of the global economic downturn, the board of directors has decided to reorganize urgently and temporarily suspend payments. We are obligated to comply. During this reorganization period, our bank will temporarily suspend operations. This announcement.</p>
<p>Situation in Shanghai: The Shanghai branch was established in the fifth year of the Republic of China, initially located at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (the current site of the Tonghe Bank). Huang Chaozhang served as the manager, followed by Wang Yunqu. The most recent manager was Zhang Rongpu. It is heard that the bank's capital is approximately 1 million yuan, with deposits of approximately 1 million yuan. The new building, completed last year, was funded by the Hong Kong head office.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Remarks: According to Lin Kanghou, Secretary of the Bankers Association, although the bank is a member of the Bankers Association, having joined in 1924 and registered with the Ministry of Industry, its head office is registered in the UK and was once protested by its peers. Unfortunately, it has now suspended operations. He said that the details of the situation were sudden and have not yet been fully clarified. The Bankers Association had not received any notification from the bank beforehand. According to financial sources, although the Shanghai branch of Guangdong Bank has suspended operations, there are no special losses on its own side. The depositors are all Cantonese compatriots in this city, and the number of interbank bills exchanged is said to be very limited.</p>
<p>Withdrawal from Exchange: Announcement No. 44 of the Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee's Bill Exchange Office states that the letter from Guangdong Bank, Exchange Bank No. 23, states that due to a telegram from Hong Kong ordering the temporary suspension of operations, the bank will temporarily withdraw from bill exchange starting from today. Since the bank has suspended operations, its request to temporarily withdraw from exchange should take effect from today. This is to inform the Executive Committee and notify all banks for their information. This announcement.</p>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Finance: After learning of the bank's suspension yesterday, the Ministry of Finance immediately issued an order to the Shanghai Bankers Association, stating that Guangdong Bank had suspended operations today due to the impact of its Hong Kong head office. Although the bank has not been registered with the Ministry, it has been a member bank of the Association for many years, so businesses in this city have had many dealings with it. In order to protect the interests of creditors in this city and stabilize the market, the Ministry urgently orders the Association to promptly investigate the bank's assets and liabilities and order it to immediately deposit all assets with the Association, without any movement or concealment, and to immediately distribute them separately to pay off debts in this city, without any delay. The Association is also ordered to forward a telegram to the Hankou Bankers Association to handle it in the same way. This order. (Above, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Association Meeting: After receiving the order, the Association immediately invited all executive committee members by telephone to hold the 74th emergency executive committee meeting that afternoon at 5:00 PM to discuss measures. Attendees included Xu Xinliu, Zhuang Dezhi, Bu Boyuan, Wu Weiru, Hu Bijiang, Hu Xixian, Jing Runshi, Qu Jigang, Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, Song Ziliang, Secretary-General Lin Kanghou, and Secretary Gu Qiu'an. The meeting was chaired by Standing Committee Member Tang Shoumin. First, Lin Kanghou reported on the progress of the negotiations, the two reports from Guangdong Bank regarding the suspension of operations, and the instructions from the Ministry of Finance. It was found that the Shanghai branch of the bank had assets of 4 million yuan and liabilities of 2 million yuan, with a surplus after offsetting income and expenses, so the Association should do its best to maintain it and fulfill its responsibilities. It was resolved that: (1) The Ministry's order will be copied and sent to the bank, in the hope that the bank will comply with the order to operate or liquidate independently. (2) An urgent telegram will be sent to the Hankou Bankers Association to relay the Ministry's order. (3) The two reports from Guangdong Bank will be copied and submitted to the Ministry of Finance. Other relief measures were also discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3>Increasing Sales of National Products: Already Implementing Exchange of Goods with Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>In order to increase the production and sales of national products, local national products businesses have entrusted many merchant groups to promote sales in various places, and have achieved considerable success in recent years. Therefore, even in border provinces and cities, national products emporiums have been established. It is learned that Yan Xishan, Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Shanxi, recognizing the importance of promoting national products, had previously sent personnel to negotiate with the national products industry in this city to exchange local products of Shanxi Province for products from national products manufacturers in this city. An exchange method has already been established and implemented, so the number of national products shipped to Shanxi Province recently has increased dramatically, and the amount of Shanxi products shipped to Shanghai is also very strong. Authorities in various northwestern provinces believe that Yan's move can not only promote national products, but also stimulate the local economy, and will follow his example.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Sends Xu Shilian to Shanghai to Investigate Tea Situation: To Provide Reference for Improving Tea</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve the problem of sluggish sales of Chinese tea, some people have advocated first controlling production and transportation, but because it is feared that this will be ineffective in practice, others have advocated handling it slowly. Recently, the Ministry of Industry sent Councilor Xu Shilian to Shanghai to conduct an on-site investigation of tea in Shanghai. The Foreign Tea Association appointed Chen Yizhou to meet with Councilor Xu for four hours. Councilor Xu solicited the opinions of Shanghai tea merchants on improving tea. Chen showed Councilor Xu a summary that had been submitted to the National Economic Commission and said that, in order to improve tea, it is necessary to start with improving tea production. Improving tea production is best achieved by loosening the soil, weeding, applying fertilizer, removing old trees, replanting new tea, and after the tea leaves are picked, attention must be paid to drying the tea leaves, and when packing, strong tea boxes must be used, etc. Councilor Xu accepted them one by one.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Borrows New Aircraft: Will Arrive in Shanghai on the 9th of This Month: To be used for the Xi'an-Chengdu Line</h3>
<p>The Xi'an-Chengdu air route of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, commissioned by the Ministry of Transportation, has been in preparation for a long time, but because the mountains between Sichuan and Shaanxi are overlapping and the climate changes rapidly, it is difficult to cope without a multi-engine aircraft. It is heard that the company has decided to use the Junkers Ju52 large aircraft on this line. The aircraft is equipped with three engines, has a load capacity of 13,000 pounds, and can carry 14 to 16 passengers. It is now planned to order several aircraft from the Junkers Aircraft Factory in Germany for future use. In order to meet the current urgent needs, it has been agreed with Lufthansa in Berlin to borrow two of these large aircraft for trial flights to China. The first aircraft, with the Lufthansa marking D.ANYK, departed from Berlin yesterday (the 4th), passed through Cairo, and advanced east along the Indian Ocean coast. If there are no weather obstacles along the way, it can reach Guangzhou on the 8th and Shanghai on the 9th. The pilot of the aircraft is the famous German pilot Lude, and the onboard mechanics and telegraphers Hao Zuo, Li Yunle, Weisiduo, and Landunbao are also working together in the aircraft. The second aircraft will also arrive within this month. After the two aircraft arrive, the company will implement the Xi'an-Chengdu route and schedule flights twice a week. If we take the aircraft from Shanghai to Chengdu in the future, we can reach Chengdu on the same day after passing through Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Hanzhong, which will be unprecedentedly convenient and fast.</p>

<h3>Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works held its First Meeting after the Autumn Recess, Discussing the Relief of Rickshaw Pullers, and the Selection of the Custodial Trustees is Largely Determined</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works held its regular meeting yesterday (September 4th). This was the first meeting of the Board after the summer recess. Mr. Arnold, the Chairman, has just returned from Europe and presided over the meeting. The Rickshaw Management Committee first reported on the registration and licensing of rickshaws. According to the report, the registration and licensing of rickshaw pullers, which had been closed on July 31st, totaled 27,135 people. From August 1st, the registration of unregistered rickshaw pullers was resumed, which was closed on August 31st. A total of 40,909 pullers were registered. It was also proposed that registered rickshaw pullers be re-registered and licensed. It is said that if the registration and licensing were to be held again, it would last until the end of October. The total number of registered rickshaw pullers could reach 41,000, and the number of unqualified rickshaw pullers would reach 11,200. Thus, it can be seen that all rickshaw pullers have been given a considerable opportunity. Furthermore, all registered rickshaw pullers should wear armbands from mid-September. Rickshaw pullers who have not been registered or registered must not solicit business. However, how to deal with rickshaw pullers who fail the inspection has become a matter of discussion. However, at a recent meeting of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association's Board of Directors, it was decided to request the Custodial Committee to allocate 50,000 yuan for the relief of rickshaw pullers who failed to register and lost their jobs. The Custodial Committee has agreed to this and has raised the funds. It has also formulated appropriate measures for how to subsidize unemployed rickshaw pullers and their immediate family members to return to their hometowns. The Special Relief Office will begin its work when rickshaw pullers cannot practice their profession unless they are registered, according to the report. The Board of Directors has agreed. Furthermore, since the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association decided to reorganize, the Custodial Committee for its funds has three members, including one member from the Rickshaw Committee, one representative from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and one representative from the Chinese Ratepayers Association. The General Chamber of Commerce and the Ratepayers Association have already appointed representatives to participate. At yesterday's board meeting, it was decided to appoint Mr. Ke Gan-chen (member of the General Chamber of Commerce) and Mr. Xu Ji-yi (General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank) as custodial trustees. The remaining custodial trustee will be Mr. Massey from the Rickshaw Committee. In addition, there are three service directors of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association. The Board of Directors has selected Mr. Chou Tzu-tung, Director of the Shanghai East Public Society of Shanghai University, and Mr. Han Yu-shan, Professor of the Department of Education of St. John's University, as service directors of the Association.</p>

<h3>Chi Chih College Nominates a Representative to Attend the Judicial Conference</h3>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Clarifies the Difference between Reminder Notes and Bills</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied to a letter from Xiangxing Electrical Weaving Factory, stating: "In reply to your letter received on the 3rd of this month, you stated that the nature of your settlement statement is different from that of a clothing store's bill, because the bill of a clothing store is a substitute for an invoice. Since your business has affixed stamps to the invoice, it should not be affixed again to the reminder note. We have carefully read and understood this. The previous letter from this chamber was to interpret the text of Article 5 of the detailed rules set by the ministry, so how the policy of its legislation is, is not discussed. Therefore, it is a critical question, not an explanatory question. The responsibility of interpretation can only be to analyze the obvious text. Now, we will further explain the meaning of the previous unfinished intention as follows: Article 3, paragraph 9 of the Stamp Tax Law focuses on the four words 'collecting arrears'. All bills with this nature can be exempted from affixing stamps, so this clause focuses on the word 'arrears', especially on the word 'collecting'. For example, those who do not use cash transactions and agree to pay the bill at the end of the month can only be called bills, not reminder notes, because they have not exceeded the agreed period at the end of the month, and one party cannot be referred to as being in arrears. Article 5 of the Ministry's Detailed Rules has the words 'customarily paying on a monthly or annual basis', which refers to this agreed period of payment, and transactions that have not expired. If the agreement is to pay the bill at the end of the month, and it is not paid by the end of the following month or the next season, then the bills issued for the second and third time are indeed of the nature of collecting arrears. Because the bills issued for the first time have already stated the name, quantity, and price of the goods, the second and third times only need to state the amount owed, without having to repeat the detailed accounts. The Ministry's Detailed Rules use this as the difference between bills and reminder notes, and the intention is here. In the old regulations, each collection of arrears had to be stamped once. If the customer's account was delayed until four or five seasons and had not been cleared, the stamping could be as many as four or five times. According to the current method, the first time the account is opened, it must be stamped according to the regulations, and the subsequent second and third collections of arrears do not need to be stamped. This is the difference between the new and old laws."</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Measures for the Property of Temples. The Chinese Buddhist Association submits a Document to the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association, in opposition to the case of "the education departments of seven provinces, including Hunan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Henan, and Jiangsu, jointly submitting to the central government, requesting the protection of temple property for running schools," has specially appointed representatives Yuan Ying, Da Bei, Ming Dao, Wang Yi-ting, and Guan Gang-zhi to go to Beijing to petition. Their submission reads as follows: "We read in the Shanghai Shen Bao of August 16, 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935], that the education departments of seven provinces, including Hunan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Henan, and Jiangsu, jointly submitted to the central government, 'requesting the protection of temple property for running local education, and strictly implementing the regulations for supervising temples, using temple property income to fund public elementary schools or local education,' and we are greatly surprised. Belief is free, as stated in the Party's program and the Provisional Constitution. Therefore, temples and churches organized because of belief, and the property they set up, should naturally be protected by national law. However, local education agencies often covet temple property because of their own lack of funds, which not only raises suspicions of encroaching on property rights, but also violates laws and regulations. As institutions for cultivating talent, they are willing to engage in acts of occupying property and violating the law. This is a major reason why the spirit of the rule of law in our country has failed to improve and is looked down upon by civilized countries around the world. Looking back, in the 20th year of the Republic, National Assembly representatives such as Luo Sang Chu Chen proposed a case to protect the civil rights of Buddhists permitted by the Provisional Constitution, which was reviewed by the Ministry of Interior (your ministry). The first and eleventh items of the original proposal stated that the National Government should order the capital, provinces, cities, and border areas to restore all Buddhist temples and monastic properties that had been occupied to their original state. However, in reality, there were many obstacles. Since the promulgation of the regulations for supervising temples, this ministry has urged the provincial and municipal governments to handle temple property in accordance with the regulations. If all were restored to their original state, it would be impossible in reality and would only cause disputes and be of no practical benefit. As for the third item, the National Government should order the entire country that if any military police or any agencies, groups, or individuals encroach upon or occupy Buddhist temple property, they should be dealt with according to the law, etc. The Provisional Constitution, Articles 6, 11, 16, and 17, clearly stipulated the details. The requested order is feasible, etc., submitted to the Executive Yuan (your court), which was submitted to the 32nd State Council meeting for resolution, and then submitted to your government (National Government) for instruction No. 400, ordering all provinces and cities to comply. Therefore, the protection of temple property has been clearly stipulated and regulated. As for the temple property that has been occupied by local education agencies and has not yet been returned, its property rights and usage rights have not been obtained in accordance with the law, and therefore cannot be protected in accordance with the law. The previous review by the Ministry of Interior (your ministry) stated that if all temple properties occupied before the promulgation of the regulations were restored to their original state, it would be impossible in reality, etc., which was actually for the purpose of reducing disputes and appeasing people. This time, the education departments of the seven provinces requested the protection of temple property for running local education, whether it is handled in accordance with the previous order, the association does not know the details. If the time of the promulgation of the regulations for supervising temples is disregarded, but only those currently occupied are requested to be protected, it not only violates laws and regulations, but it will also be seen that in the future, the temple property encroached upon by local education agencies can be requested to be protected, then disputes will arise endlessly, and there will be no end to it. How can the laws of the country be implemented, and how can the property rights of the people be protected? Article 10 of the Regulations for Supervising Temples stipulates, 'Temples should, according to their property situation, engage in public welfare or charitable undertakings,' which is to prevent the waste of temple funds and benefit society. The association has already drafted the Regulations for Buddhist Temples to Engage in Compassionate and Public Welfare Undertakings, submitted to the Ministry of Interior (your ministry) for forwarding to the Executive Yuan (your court) for internal record. Article 3 of the original regulations states, 'When engaging in various undertakings, the economic situation of each temple should be considered. An undertaking may be independently engaged in by one temple, or jointly organized by several temples, or jointly organized by all the temples in the local area under the supervision of the local Buddhist association.' The temples finance on their own and carry out public welfare projects etc. The scope of the enterprises is not limited, the methods already have regulations, and have been submitted for the record, naturally it should not be presumptuously done by the local education authorities. The situation of the joint submission to the central government by the education departments of the seven provinces as reported in the Shen Bao, if true, is obviously an act of encroaching upon temple property and income, and should be strictly prohibited according to laws and regulations, and the national Buddhist followers cannot allow the seizure. (In addition to submitting separately to the National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Education for review), the association explains the situation and requests, hoping your Government (your Yuan) (your Ministry) will inspect, bestow uphold public justice, so as to avoid disputes, and uphold the law, and also beg to instruct to comply, truly for the public good. Respectfully submitted, National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Education, President of the Chinese Buddhist Association Tong Ying, Standing Directors Da Bei, Ming Dao, Hong Shan, Ke Duan, Yuan Chen, Wang Chen, Wen Lan-ting, Guan Jiong, Huang Qing-lan, Qu Ying-guang, August 24, 24th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Inspection Office Notifies Wine Merchants: Guest Wine Arriving in Shanghai Should Still be Reported and Transported as Usual. Rumors of Closure are Absolutely Not True.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Inspection Office of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau issued a notice yesterday because it recently read in the newspaper that the Shanghai Sorghum Wine Trade Association had published a notice containing many untrue contents, fearing that inland wine merchants would not understand the truth. It was posted in various places such as Xinzha Bridge Sanban Factory Xinqiao to widely inform the public. The text reads: "Regarding the matter of the announcement, this office, on August 3 of this year, seized Yang Zhi-ting based on a tip-off, for using infused wine to mix with local liquor to evade taxes and transport for sale. The case has been submitted to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance for verification and is awaiting punishment. All wine boats from Taixing continuing to come to Shanghai will still be inspected according to regulations, and the weighing procedures have not been stopped. However, recently reading the notice published by the Shanghai Sorghum Wine Industry Association, it stated that according to the notice from Feng Zi-jing, the representative of the Taixing Wine Industry Association stationed in Shanghai, this office's seizure of infused wine was illegal. It has been a month and has not been released, which has aroused the public anger of all wine merchants, and they have all automatically suspended business, etc. This notice informs all members that in the short term, northern wine will inevitably have no goods arriving at the port, and advises to temporarily stop selling wholesale wine, so as not to cause disputes when there are no goods to deliver, etc. It has been verified that Taixing wine boats are still coming to Shanghai as usual. Feng Zi-jing's notice to the Sorghum Wine Association is a fabrication of rumors, so as to confuse the hearing. It is appropriate to announce this widely, and all merchants must believe that they have no intention of mixing and evading taxes, and they can report, transport, weigh, and sell as usual, without having to be suspicious, so as not to be used by one or two unscrupulous merchants and harm their own business. The inspectors of this office have always been dedicated and law-abiding. If there is any difficulty or solicitation, they are allowed to report to the office at any time and punish them according to law. This is the announcement, September 4, 24th year of the Republic of China, Director Jin Gong"</p>
<h3>Mrs. Burgh, an American Official, Attends the Opening Ceremony of the Central Midwifery School, Held in the Capital at 10:00 a.m. Today</h3>
<p>Mrs. Robert Burgh, representative of the American Association for Chinese Children's Welfare, received a telegram from Liu Rui-heng, Director of the Department of Health of the Ministry of Interior, inviting her to rush to Nanjing to attend the opening ceremony of the Central Midwifery School. Therefore, she and her daughter, Miss Robert Burgh, took the overnight express train last night at 11:00 p.m. When they arrived at Xiaguan, Xu Jian-ping, Secretary-General of the American Association for Chinese Children's Welfare, Director Liu of the Department of Health, and Ms. Yang Chong-rui, etc., were waiting at the platform. They drove to the Central Hotel to rest. The opening ceremony of the Central Midwifery School is scheduled to be held at 10:00 a.m. today.

Mrs. Burgh is scheduled to return to Shanghai by train on the evening of the 8th, attend the September board meeting of the Chinese Association for Child Welfare on the 14th, and then travel north on the 16th to visit the Peiping Xiangshan Children's Welfare Home and other famous children's welfare institutions in China.</p>
<h3>Chinese Association for Child Welfare Sends Personnel to Assist in the Relief of Child Victims of the Flood. Secretary Zhao Joins the Flood Relief Association to Serve.</h3>
<p>This year, China's flood disaster is extremely severe, and the number of people displaced and homeless in various places is countless. In the circular issued by the National Government on the closing day of Children's Year, it also stated, "Currently, various local disasters have occurred repeatedly, and the number of children who have been displaced and need relief is not small." It can be seen that the relief of child victims of floods in various places is an urgent matter. The Shanghai Chinese Association for Child Welfare, in order to comply with the National Government's circular and assist in the relief of child victims of floods, has contacted the Flood Relief Association and decided to dispatch Secretary Zhao Jian to join the association to serve. Under the command and orders of the association, special attention will be paid to the relief of child victims, such as investigating the situation of child victims, supervising local shelters, handling children's nutrition, hygiene, and education, preventing the occurrence of child trafficking and abuse in disaster areas, and finding ways to resettle orphans in disaster areas, etc., as matters to be noted by the secretary. Once the Flood Relief Association has made arrangements and the personnel have a scheduled departure date, the secretary can depart with them. Also, if there is an urgent need in reality, Chen Tie-sheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Association for Child Welfare, will also depart with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Ben D. Dopman, member of the Economic Group of the United States Tariff Commission, and his wife, and Mr. Frank A. Warning and his wife, who were sent by the U.S. government to the Philippines to investigate the economic situation, arrived in Shanghai on the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Grant the day before yesterday.

<h3>China Travel Service Organizes the Baibao Tide-Watching Tour</h3>
<p>The tide of Zhejiang has long been famous at home and abroad, but people only know to go to Haining, and few know that Baibao, which is more than ten miles east of Haining, is actually an excellent scenic spot for watching the tide. When the tide comes, it first reaches Baibao, and after a burst of excitement, it turns into Haining again. Therefore, the tide of Haining is actually just the aftermath of Baibao. The largest tides of Baibao are on the 13th, 14th, and 15th of September (i.e., the 16th, 17th, and 18th of the lunar August). In order to allow members of society to feast their eyes, the China Travel Service has specially organized the Baibao Tide-Watching Tour for those three days. Every day at 7:00 a.m., the tour departs from the headquarters of the company at No. 420 Sichuan Road or the residences of various group members (for those with more than four people, the company will provide a special car for pick-up and drop-off), and takes a specially prepared car directly to Baibao. The company has set up tents at the tide-watching site to block the scorching sun. Each guest will also be given a delicate lunch box by the company for lunch. Those who have lived in the city for a long time can take advantage of the tide-watching event to take a coastal trip with their families or two or three close friends to relieve their boredom. It is beneficial to their physical and mental health. It is said that the quota is 80 people. The travel fee is 8.5 yuan for company group members and 9 yuan for non-group members. People from all walks of life who want to register and buy tickets are kindly requested to participate as soon as possible, so as not to miss out. The contact point is the headquarters of the China Travel Service at No. 410 Sichuan Road and various branches in this city, and brochures are available for collection.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Shanghai Guide Service</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Mu-sheng, a Cantonese returning to Shanghai after touring overseas last year, realized that the guide service industry is very developed abroad. Shanghai is a major trading port, but it lacks a formal guide agency, so tourists who come to Shanghai for the first time often feel it is difficult to ask for directions. Therefore, he resolutely founded the Shanghai Guide Service to serve the society. Since its opening at the end of last month, it has been convenient for all walks of life, and business has been improving day by day. The reason is that all male and female guides of the company have undergone rigorous training and are dedicated to serving. The prices are low. Recently, various circles in Shanghai and guests from other places have called to contact and dispatch guides, and there have been many cases every day. They all feel very satisfied. Currently, Director Huang still convenes all guides every morning to give lectures, imparting various necessary knowledge to improve their service performance. It is reported that the company is the first guide agency founded by Chinese people. All our compatriots should give it strong support, so that it can become more and more advanced and keep pace with foreign guide services. However, it is heard that some people who do not understand the company's purpose do not cherish their precious time and often falsely report phone numbers or fake names and addresses. Their purpose is actually to make the guides make futile trips, which is meaningless and regrettable.</p>

<h3>Supreme Court Ruling on Liang Tongfang Case: Original Sentence of Six Months Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years Upheld</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Liang Tongfang, a student at the East Asia Physical Education School, was arrested last year on October 19th for throwing a bomb as a warning at the Yuelai Native Goods Store. After investigation, it was determined there was no intent to kill, and he was found not guilty. The police department, dissatisfied with this outcome, appealed. The defendant, Liang Tongfang, hired lawyer Ma Junshuo for his defense. The Supreme Court has now ruled, upholding the original sentence of six months imprisonment, suspended for two years. The original text of the judgment is as follows: Supreme Court Criminal Judgment, Appellant: Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court; Defendant: Liang Tongfang, male, 26 years old, student, residing at the East Asia Physical Education School in the Nanshi district of Shanghai. The appellant is appealing a conviction related to the offense of possessing explosives. He is dissatisfied with the second instance judgment of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court on December 11th, Republic of China Year 23. This court rules as follows: (Main Text) The original judgment regarding the crime and punishment is revoked. Liang Tongfang, intending to use them for his own criminal purposes, possessed explosives. He is sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years. The bomb fragments are confiscated. (Reasoning) The defendant in this case, Liang Tongfang, previously participated in the anti-Japanese war as a volunteer soldier. After being discharged, he brought a bomb from Beiping to Shanghai and joined the Red Blood Assassination Corps, continuing his patriotic activities. On October 19th, Republic of China Year 23, at 12:00 noon, upon learning that the Guangdong Road Yuelai Native Goods Store was purchasing Japanese goods, he carried a bomb to the store intending to throw it as a warning. Upon arriving at the store, his companions, Fu Rongsheng and others, were inside conducting business. He told them he was going to throw a bomb and for them to leave and seek shelter. Fu Rongsheng and the others did not understand him. The defendant raised his hand to signal them, causing the bomb to slip and fall under the counter, triggering the firing pin. Instantly, the packaging and companions Fu Rongsheng, Ding Yan, Pan Honghe, and customers Wan Er and others suffered minor injuries. The defendant's right arm was shattered and half gone, and two fingers on his left and right hands were also blown off. He fell to the ground with severe injuries. He was arrested and prosecuted by the police department. These are the facts as determined by the original judgment. The appellant's accusation against the original judgment essentially claims that the defendant threw the bomb with the intent to kill, and failing to prosecute him for attempted premeditated murder is a gross error. Furthermore, his joining the Red Blood Assassination Corps means he should also be charged with participating in an organization with the purpose of committing crimes, and failing to investigate this according to the law is also inappropriate. This court finds that the defendant has repeatedly confessed that upon learning that the Yuelai Native Goods Store was selling Japanese goods, he carried a bomb with the intention of throwing it as a warning. However, according to his statement, he wanted to bomb their counter as a warning and did not want to hurt anyone. He stated, "I didn't throw it because I pulled the pin. I told them to get out of the way quickly, but they didn't listen to me. Because the safety pin had already been pulled for four or five minutes, I panicked, my hand slipped, and it fell on the ground and exploded. If I had intended to throw it, why wouldn't I have thrown the bomb inside and escaped? Moreover, that side is close to the road, making it easy to escape. It wouldn't have exploded near me, and I wouldn't have been the most severely injured." He steadfastly denies any intention to injure or kill anyone. The first instance summoned the victims Fu Rongsheng and Ding Yan, both of whom testified that the defendant stood outside the counter and spoke to them, but they could not understand his intentions, which is credible. Pan Hongsheng also said that he saw him (referring to the defendant) speaking to Fu and Ding very urgently. This provides some evidence that the defendant did tell them to take shelter. Furthermore, after the defendant pulled the safety pin of the bomb, if he had the intention to injure or kill anyone, he would have used force to throw it towards Fu Rongsheng and the others inside the counter. Why would the result be that he himself was injured, and his injuries were more severe than those of Fu Rongsheng and the others? This is enough to prove that the defendant's claim that he intended to destroy the counter as a warning, and that Fu Rongsheng and the others did not listen and take shelter, and that the bomb slipped from his hand in a panic, is the truth. Although leaflets found in the defendant's residence, titled "Painful Commemoration of the September 18th National Humiliation" and "Admonishing Traitorous Merchants," contained phrases such as "Vowing to fight to the end with guns and cannons, with a spirit of daring to die, resolutely eliminating traitors," their purpose was still to warn merchants selling Japanese goods not to purchase them again. If he truly intended to commit murder, he would never have given prior warning to allow them to prepare. Furthermore, his gathering with several people at the Heming Hotel beforehand was to discuss methods of warning, as the defendant confessed. One cannot simply infer from the fact that he discussed something with others that what they discussed must have been a plan to kill. This is very clear. Although the defendant published a notice in the Shanghai Evening News after the first instance judgment to thank all sectors of society, which contained the phrase "corpse admonition," it refers to suicide and cannot be evidence of murder. The original trial court found that the defendant did not have the intent to murder, and that he committed the crime of threatening others with an act harmful to life, causing danger to safety and intending to use it for criminal purposes, and possessing explosives, and was accordingly sentenced to a severe punishment. Negligent injury is a crime that requires a complaint from the victim, and since no complaint was filed by the victims, it was not considered, which is appropriate. However, the original judgment acknowledged that the defendant had joined the Red Blood Assassination Corps, and his bombing warning to the merchant was part of the group's work. Therefore, in addition to the two crimes of obstructing freedom and endangering public safety, the defendant should also be found guilty of participating in an organization with the purpose of committing crimes. Although this crime has a causal relationship with the aforementioned crimes, the most serious crime of endangering public safety should be used to determine the punishment. The original trial court failed to mention this, which is a significant omission. Furthermore, now that the new criminal code has been implemented, according to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of that law, the law in effect at the time of judgment should be applied. The original judgment was based on the old criminal code, which cannot be upheld. The points raised in the appeal are not entirely without merit. The original judgment should be revoked and a new judgment issued. Furthermore, the defendant has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment or a more severe criminal penalty. Moreover, his becoming disabled as a result of the crime is sufficient to prompt remorse. A sentence of six months imprisonment with a suspended sentence is appropriate. Based on the above, it is concluded that in accordance with Article 389, Paragraph 1, Sections 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Article 117, Article 154, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 205, Article 55, Article 74, Section 1, Article 388, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as follows: (as stated in the Main Text). Supreme Court Criminal Seventh Tribunal, July 25th, Republic of China Year 24. Presiding Judge: Zhang Yutao; Judges: Yang Shoucen, Sun Zuxian, Sun Honglin, Cao Yong; Clerk: Ju Weixin. (This true copy is certified to be identical to the original.) Delivered on August 26th, Republic of China Year 24.</p>

Hearing this recitation, we deeply admire and express our gratitude. We will take note and follow accordingly."</p>

<h3>Japanese Consulate Arrests Koreans for Secretly Selling Drugs</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Daily News, on the first of this month, some Koreans and Russians were secretly selling heroin to Chinese people, at a price of eight yuan for every one-third of an ounce. The Japanese Consulate Police Department learned of this and, at 3:30 PM on the first, Suzuki, the criminal division chief of the Japanese Police Department, along with detectives Koyanagi and Nagaoka, arrested the main suspects, Koreans Li Longxiang, Wu Mingzhi, and three others. They are currently being strictly interrogated. It is said that Li and Wu often associate with Russians.

<h3>Setting Up a Scheme to Defraud and Swindle Property; Zhenhua Bank Collapses; Empty Checks for Over 100,000 Yuan Issued in Just Two Months; Manager Zhang Zhendao and Assistant Zhu Shaoshan Have All Fled</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhendao, also known as Fu Yan, the manager of Zhenhua Bank at No. 441 Broadway Road, Public Concession, is about thirty years old and from Danyang. Zhu Shaoshan, the assistant manager, is also about thirty years old and from the same hometown. The bank opened less than two months ago. The bank conspired with someone surnamed Shi and someone surnamed Wang, etc., to use the bank's checks to purchase goods from various factories, shops, and merchants. The checks issued were all long-term checks from the bank, totaling over 100,000 yuan. Some of these checks have now matured, and when the check holders went to redeem them yesterday, they found the bank doors tightly closed and learned that it had collapsed. Over fifty check holders jointly went to the police station to accuse Zhang Zhendao and Zhu Shaoshan of setting up a fake bank to defraud and swindle property, requesting that they be arrested and investigated. Some of the check holders learned that Zhang Zhendao was involved in the Meilun Rosewood Shop several years ago and that this was a deliberate scheme. They have separately hired lawyers and filed a request with the Shanghai First Special District Court to quickly order the police to arrest them and conduct a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Li Jilin Assault Case: Truth Has Been Ascertained; Organized in Advance; Perpetrators Detained for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>He Donglin and Li Jilin, local foremen at the Zhonghua Socks Factory at No. 377 Longjiang Road, have a total of thirty workers under them. In January, the factory decided to reduce each worker's wages by one-tenth. The workers were quite dissatisfied, believing that this proposal was made by them. Protests were ineffective, and the workers deeply resented Li. They planned to retaliate with violence. They mutually agreed that each person would save and deposit one yuan per month in a bank. After accumulating over one hundred yuan, they would withdraw the money and hire thugs to take action at a suitable opportunity. If a major incident occurred and they were arrested, they would hire a lawyer to defend them in court. On August 5th, at around 5:00 PM, this plan was put into action. They called Li and falsely told him that his brother had been injured in an accident near Dongxin Bridge by a Nantong Company truck and that representatives of the company were waiting near Zhuangyuan Lane, Yade Road, to discuss a settlement. Li received the call and believed it to be true. He and foreman He Donglin rushed to the location. Unexpectedly, three thugs dragged Li into the third lane of Ruichang Lane on Yade Road and severely beat his right arm and leg with iron bars. He fell to the ground, gasping for breath. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, scattered and fled. Later, a street patrol arrested them and transported the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fan De, the Chinese detective chief of the Hongkou Police Department, investigated and found that the incident was instigated by Wu Jinyao, Li Xiaogen, Mao Zhenhua, Fu Xiaomao, Li Zilin, Zheng Changrong, and other workers from the Zhonghua Socks Factory. The six suspects were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang presided over the hearing at the First Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer from the Public Works Department, provided a detailed account of the incident, stating that the victim's injuries in the hospital were quite severe, with three leg bones broken, making him unable to appear in court to testify. The case was initiated by the defendants Fu Xiaomao and Zheng Changrong, who suggested saving money in the bank, leading to this disaster. He presented the doctor's injury report for review. The defendants completely denied this, requesting an investigation. According to foreman He Donglin, he went to the location with the victim and saw Wu Jinyao, Li Xiaogen, Mao Zhenhua, and three others standing nearby before entering the lane. Shortly afterward, three young men wearing white short shirts and Xiangyunsha blue cloth shirts and trousers dragged Li into the third lane of Ruichang, beating him with iron bars over twenty times. When he stepped forward to dissuade them, the person wearing the white short shirt punched him hard in the chest. The court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing to summon witnesses for further verification.</p>

<h3>Adjournment of the Trial for Melting National Currency; Investigation and Evidence Completed, Closing Arguments Concluded On-Site; Exhibits Stored in the Property Depository, Verdict Scheduled for Ten Days</h3>
<p>French police detective Juli (transliteration), Chinese inspector Jiang Futian, senior detective Wang Rusong, detective Zhang Daorong, detective Liu Quanrong, Wang Dongwan, Guo Shaowan, etc., cracked down on a huge illegal factory for melting national currency and miscellaneous silver at No. 170 Pushe Road on the 14th of last month at around 1:00 AM. They arrested fourteen workers on the spot, including Yu Qijin, Ji Heshang, Xie Laichao, Xie Ajin, Yang Renchuan, Li Heshang, Liu A*, Zhou Guoan, Wang Yuanzhang, Zhou Shichao, Li Miaofa, Han Azhang, Chen Jianchu, Han Asheng, etc. They seized stolen goods such as silver ingots and lead ingots, as well as evidence such as double dime silver coins, current yuan account books, etc. in iron boxes. They were taken to the police station. According to the joint confessions of Li Miaofa and Li Heshang, they went to Yichang Foundry at No. 364 Yongxing Road, Zhabei, and continued to arrest Li Guoliang (the younger brother of the fugitive main offender Li Guoxiang), and seized twenty-four small silver strips and small silver ingots and a photo of Li Guoxiang. They proceeded to Huaxing Road in Zhabei to arrest accountant Ni Runzhen, and the cases were transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. The investigations have now been completed by the police's law enforcement division. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special Court presided over the trial at the First Criminal Court. The police presented various pieces of evidence seized. Yuan Jiahan, the lawyer from the police's law enforcement division, stated the investigation details, stating that the defendants were arrested for illegally melting national currency and are now being prosecuted in accordance with Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Those Who Harm the National Currency (which states that anyone who destroys national currency or Central Mint coins with the intention of making a profit shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years and may also be fined not more than one thousand yuan). Liu Jinrong, the detective in charge of the case, was summoned to testify about the case. Detective Liu reported on the arrest and the search, stating that the main offenders in the organization were Li Guoxiang, Zhao Zhang (resident of No. 5, Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre), and Zhang Rong (resident of No. 4, Xinli Lane, Mengua Street, Nanshi), all of whom are at large and have not been apprehended. The judge then ordered the defendants to be interrogated separately. First, Ni Runzhen was interrogated. He stated, "I am not the accountant of the organization, nor am I a shareholder. I only assisted in selling silver bars. The shareholders are Zhang Wenbiao, etc. I do not manage the accounts, which are managed by Zhu Baohua, who has gone to Zhenjiang. There was no melting of silver yuan coins. I sold silver bars to the Central Bank's miscellaneous silver purchasing department about forty times, which can be verified by the records." He presented several Central Bank application forms. Regarding the silver bar quality, Zhang Hairong was responsible for purchasing it. Li Guoliang was the supplier. He submitted several Central Bank applications. Li Guoliang testified, "Guoxiang is my older brother. I know nothing about the organization on Pushe Road, but I supplied lead billets for improving the silver quality. The seized small silver bars were made by melting silver scraps purchased from silver shops." The other fourteen defendants, Yu Qijin, etc., testified that they were either engaged in melting work, pulling the bellows, or were cooks or kitchen apprentices, and all denied melting silver yuan coins, stating that they only melted miscellaneous silver. At this point, the police's law enforcement lawyer stated that the police had found that Hongda Money Shop at No. 362 Avenue Edward VII had delivered several thousand yuan worth of silver dimes to the organization each time, as evidenced by several receipts. The court questioned the defendants about this. Li Guoliang and Ni Runzhen both claimed they did not know. At this point, the court considered the facts to be clear and the evidence to be complete and ordered that closing arguments be made. The hearing was then adjourned, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced in ten days. The defendants were remanded in custody, and the seized silver bars, lead billets, and other exhibits were temporarily stored in the property depository.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Advertising in the Telephone Directory; Novel Method; Impressing Seals after Inspecting Telephones; Two People Accused of Deceiving for Commissions</h3>
<p>The advertising in the telephone directory printed by the Shanghai Telephone Company is entirely contracted out to the Mailingdeng Company at No. 669 Sichuan Road. Mailingdeng hires staff to solicit advertisements from various businesses, paying a commission of 15 percent. Xu Guangzu from Shaoxing and Huang Limin from Wuxi are two of the company's advertising solicitors. Recently, due to the poor economic conditions, soliciting advertisements has been difficult. They have taken a different approach. When they see a business with a telephone, they visit the business under the pretext of inspecting whether the telephone is in good condition. If the business replies that the telephone is not damaged, Xu and Huang immediately produce a sheet of English paper and instruct the business to affix its seal to the paper. The business owners, unaware of the scheme, agree to affix their seals, not knowing that this is an order for an advertisement in the telephone directory. Xu and others then hand over the sealed order to Mailingdeng as proof that they have solicited an advertisement. The company, seeing the business's seal on the order, does not investigate and pays the two their commissions. From July 1st of this year to the present, Xu has received 651 yuan in commissions, and Huang has received 150 yuan. Because Mailingdeng was collecting payments from various businesses, this problem was discovered. They reported to the General Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Wu Chunrong to arrest Xu and Huang and hand them over to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Bao prosecuted them under Articles 210 and 339 of the Criminal Law. Mailingdeng also hired lawyer Fan to appear in court, stating that the money taken by Xu and Huang has been returned by their families, so they are requesting that the civil suit be withdrawn and requesting leniency. Xu and Huang both confessed to the facts. Lawyer Ma Leming defended them. Presiding Judge Feng sentenced Xu to a fine of 100 yuan and Huang to a fine of 40 yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Chen Bingwei Impersonates a Doctor to Defraud Wealth, Lacking Both Registration License and Medical School Graduation, First Special Court Issues Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>A Guangdong native named Chen Bingwei, who claimed to be a Doctor of Medicine, set up a practice at 623 Sichuan Road, specializing in the treatment of venereal diseases. He also placed advertisements in Western newspapers, using the Western name (Dr. James Duncan, i.e., Jing Shi Dengken). After investigation by the police, it was discovered that Chen not only did not have a registration license but also had no medical qualifications. He was, in fact, impersonating a doctor to defraud patients of their money. Therefore, Chinese Detective Dong Zhaobin and Western Detective Weir Cox were dispatched to investigate the matter. After confirming the facts, they requested the First Special Court to issue a warrant for Chen's arrest, ordering him to surrender to the court for questioning. Yesterday morning was the scheduled date for questioning. Judge Ye Shengchao arrived at the Second Criminal Court. The defendant, Chen Bingwei, did not appear. Attorney Gu Yongquan arrived in court, stating that Chen had already returned to his hometown to gather evidence, so he requested a postponement. Then, the police attorney, Shi Zhu, stood up and stated that the defendant, Chen Bingwei, was being prosecuted for fraud under Article 329 of the Criminal Law. It was found that the defendant, Chen Bingwei, claimed to be a Doctor of Medicine specializing in venereal diseases. However, after investigation by the police, it was confirmed that the defendant had neither graduated from a medical school nor possessed a doctor's license. He was not registered with the authorities in the Chinese and foreign concessions. Therefore, he had no medical qualifications. The police then went to the defendant's clinic to search it. As a result, the defendant had no account books. Later, on August 8, the police sent someone pretending to be a patient to the defendant's clinic. The defendant gave him an injection and charged him three yuan, issuing a receipt. This alone proves that the defendant used the doctor's title to defraud money. However, most of those who sought treatment from the defendant were foreign sailors, with relatively few Chinese. Because the defendant's brother used to be a doctor, the defendant worked as his assistant and thus knew some medical common sense. Five years ago, the defendant's brother passed away. The defendant then used the Western name Jing Shi Dengken to attract business. It was found that Jing Shi Dengken was a real person who used to be a teacher at a medical school and enjoyed a good reputation. Now the defendant is just borrowing someone else's name, and so on. Judge Ye reviewed the report and, because the defendant Chen Bingwei failed to appear after being summoned, ordered an arrest warrant to be issued. The case was postponed for seven days for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Gao Liqiao Directly Confesses to Killing His Younger Brother, Sentencing Scheduled for the 10th</h3>
<p>Gao Liqiao and Gao Liyang, brothers from Funing, were both engaged in the boat business. This time, they loaded stones from the interior to Shanghai. Their boat was docked at the Yunzaobang in Wusong. On the evening of the second of last month, Gao Liqiao, for some unknown reason, started a dispute and, holding a sharp axe, killed his younger brother, Gao Liyang. He then threw the body into the river, intending to cover up the crime. This was discovered by a neighboring boat, who cried for help. The criminal Gao Liqiao was apprehended and handed over to the water patrol, who sent him to the Public Security Bureau for detention. At the same time, efforts were made to recover the body of Gao Liyang, which was reported to the local court, who sent personnel to examine the body and provide a coffin. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau transferred the criminal Gao Liqiao to the court for legal proceedings. It is now known that this case has been investigated several times by Prosecutor Ouyang Shu, and after on-site investigation, the facts were clarified. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed based on the charge of murder. Yesterday morning, at 10:50, Judge Zhang Shao specially opened the Fifth Tribunal for the trial. After the judge took the seat, considering the importance of the case and the violent nature of the criminal, in order to be cautious, he ordered additional bailiffs to be dispatched to the court to maintain order. The judge ordered the prisoner Gao Liqiao to be brought before the court. He testified that he was 38 years old, from Funing, and worked as a boatman, living on the boat. The judge asked, "Why did you kill your younger brother, Gao Liyang?" He replied, "Although my younger brother was nominally a boatman, he actually wandered around all day, wasting money. However, in our hometown, there is still an old mother who lacks food and clothing. I told him not to waste money. If he could save some, he could send it back to support our mother. But he not only didn't listen but also held a grudge and used a firewood axe to hack at me randomly. I didn't hack him." The official said, "At the time of the incident, your brother was already asleep. His bedding was stained with blood. How can you still say that he hacked at you with an axe? Today, in the public trial, you are still thinking of lying." He replied, "I really don't know who killed him." The judge asked, "Why was the deceased naked?" He replied, "He slept naked at night." The judge asked, "This alone proves that you premeditated the murder, waiting for him to fall asleep before committing the crime. You dared to throw the body into the river, intending to destroy the evidence. You are extremely cruel. Moreover, you confessed in the Public Security Bureau and to the prosecutor that you hacked him once with an axe. You should confess the truth now." The criminal, listening to the instructions, lowered his head in silence. When asked where the axe came from, he replied, "It was used on the boat for chopping firewood." The judge asked, "How old is your brother this year? Who else is in your family?" He replied, "Liyang is 22 years old this year. Our father died more than ten years ago. In my family, there is only my mother, who is over sixty years old, my wife, who is also at home in Jiangbei, and my sister-in-law, who is on the boat with me." The judge asked, "When did the incident happen?" He replied, "Around midnight." The judge asked, "Since you killed your younger brother, why did you throw the body into the river?" He replied, "I kicked him into the water." At this point, Prosecutor Ouyang Shu arrived in court and read out the charges. The appointed defense lawyer then rose to defend him, stating that the deceased had been in Shanghai for three or four years and had never sent any money back home to support his mother. Therefore, the defendant was temporarily angry, his nerves were confused, and this tragedy occurred. He requested a lenient sentence. The judge asked Gao Liqiao if he had any final statement. He replied no, only begging for a light sentence. The judge, having obtained the confession and understanding the case, considered the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the tenth of this month. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Xin Kang Zhuang's Appeal in the Rong Zongjing Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>The Fuxin Flour Mill, managed by industrialist Rong Zongjing, had business dealings with Xin Kang Money Shop. At the end of 1931, it owed Xin Kang 60,000 yuan. Rong mortgaged a warehouse receipt for 400 bales of cotton yarn from the Shenxin Cotton Mill as collateral. Later, Xin Kang suspended operations and was unable to take delivery from Shenxin, leading to a lawsuit filed by Sun Bosheng, a shareholder representative of Xin Kang, against Rong for fraud. The initial trial acquitted Rong. Sun, dissatisfied, appealed to the Special First Court's collegial panel, which had already concluded the hearing. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Feng Shide, along with Judges Liu and Jiang, opened the First Criminal Court and announced the verdict: the appeal was dismissed.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Announces Account Report, Report Submitted by the Custody Committee, Approved by Special Meeting of the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society's accounts for the last fiscal year, closing on July 31 of this year, have been submitted by the society's financial custody committee to the board of directors for approval, and in accordance with the society's organizing laws, a copy of the accounts has been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for record. The custody committee's report and the entire accounts are now published below:</p>
<p>The itemized expenditure account details the management fees of the general society and the business fees of the five branch societies. Various renovation expenses for the general society's rented premises have already been deducted from the previous year's income. The expenditure on direct relief is lower than the original budget, but it will take time for everyone to fully understand the existence of this relief work. However, whenever a request for relief is received, the mutual aid society will carefully and thoroughly consider it. If the situation is confirmed and the request is made by a rickshaw puller or their family within the Public Concession, the society has never refused. Future relief plans will be based on this principle and seek to be more widespread to the majority. Furthermore, one of the largest items in last year's expenditure was the rickshaw license fee. This expenditure was earmarked at the beginning of the society's operations and not used for other purposes. Recently, the board of directors held another meeting and decided to ask the custody committee to separately allocate 40,000 yuan to pay rickshaw pullers' insurance premiums and 50,000 yuan for relief for unemployed rickshaw pullers, to provide funds for unemployed rickshaw pullers to return to their hometowns or for rickshaw pullers who are unable to pull carts due to not having registered for a license. In addition, it is also proposed to ask the custody committee to allocate 10,000 yuan as a basic fund for rickshaw pullers' retirement subsidies, to the extent possible. These various plans have been approved by the custody committee. Since there are surplus funds in the accounts submitted this time, the above-mentioned uses can be carved out of the surplus.

<h3>Xinzha Detective Squad Uncovers a Case of Abduction of a Young Girl Using Drugs, With All Manner of Ghouls and Goblins Involved, Coming and Going Now Clearly Understood</h3>
<p>Sha Laoer, a night soil worker at the Public Concession’s Sanitation Department, residing at 54 Ganxingfang, Binlang Road, under the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road police station, had a child bride named Liu Gendi (i.e., Sha Liu). Liu Gendi, who is fifteen years old this year, usually worked at Shenxin No. 9 Factory. On the evening of June 26 of this year, the child bride went out to work the night shift and never returned. Her family immediately searched everywhere, but her whereabouts were unknown. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, the Xinzha Branch of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau suddenly received a confidential report that Gendi had been abducted by drug-using bandits and hidden in a bandit den in Yangjiaqiao (also known as No. 4 Bridge), Zhenru. The leaders of the detective squad, Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan, along with foremen Dong Wenrui and Liu Changpei, discussed the matter and immediately dispatched detectives Zhang Shuwen, Yang Yucai, and Cai Jilin to Yangjiaqiao, Zhenru. However, the bandits had already fled after hearing the news. Only one bandit accomplice, identified as A, was apprehended. He claimed that the boss's name was Wang Jinchuan and his current whereabouts were unknown. He also confessed that Gendi had been sold to a barber shop owned by a Xu in Yangxiangjing Town, Kunshan County, for 143 yuan. That evening, the squad dispatched the original detectives to take a train and then a boat to Yangxiangjing Town, where they coordinated with the local Public Security Bureau to go to the barber shop. They successfully rescued Gendi and brought her back to Shanghai yesterday morning. The detective squad then summoned Gendi's father-in-law, Sha Laoer, to the station to identify her, which he did without error. According to Gendi, that evening, a young girl first patted me on the head, and I immediately lost consciousness. I only saw rivers on both sides and a road in the middle, so I followed her. It was not until three days later that I woke up, but I had already arrived at a house of people I did not know and could not leave freely. After living there for thirteen days, they took me by boat to Kunshan and eventually to the barber shop, where I have been for a month.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director of the Beining Railway, Zheng Baozhao, Arrives in Shanghai, Discusses His Impressions of Inspecting Various Railways</h3>
<p>Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway, who was hired as a railway advisor to the national government by General Hamer, was ordered to accompany him on an inspection of domestic railways. After four months, his duties have been completed. He arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday. According to Deputy Director Zheng yesterday, he was ordered in May of this year to accompany Advisor Hamer on an inspection of railways throughout the country. He successively visited the Pinghan, Longhai, Pingsui, Beining, Jinpu, Jinghu, Huhangyong, Yuehan, and Jiaoji railways. Although limited by time, he was unable to conduct a detailed inspection, but generally speaking, all railways have made significant progress in terms of morale and material resources. The railways that have been most affected by years of military conflict have been thoroughly reformed by the authorities, such as replacing rotten sleepers, repairing damaged bridges, and shortening travel times, all of which have been gradually implemented. The staff is also full of vitality, which is a good sign in the midst of construction. It is said that Deputy Director Zheng will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go to Beijing and Tianjin within a day or two.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Swimming Pool to Close</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to close the Hongkou open-air swimming pool on the afternoon of the 15th of this month due to the approaching autumn, thus ending this year's swimming season.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Bandmaster Baequi Continues in Position, Summer Outdoor Concerts End, Winter Program to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Bandmaster Baequi had previously submitted his resignation, with his dismissal date set for October 31 of this year. However, the Music Committee believed that the band in its current form would be completely disbanded or reorganized on May 31 of the following year, so it advocated retaining Baequi and continuing his employment until the end of May of the following year. This proposal has now been approved by the board of directors. The terms of his continued employment will be negotiated by both parties. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Council Band is currently on vacation. After the vacation ends, there will be two more outdoor military band concerts, one on the 29th of this month and one on October 6, at Zhaofeng Garden, which will be the end of the summer concerts. The winter program will begin on October 13. The first three concerts (October 13, 20, and 27) will begin at 9:15 PM, and the subsequent four will begin at 5:15 PM. According to the bandmaster's proposal, five symphony concerts with famous soloists are planned for this winter, with slightly higher ticket prices. The remaining concerts will feature lighter music, with prices aimed at affordability. After discussion by the Music Committee, it was agreed that the special features of the soloists should not be limited to the symphony concerts and that the music of the lighter concerts must also be of true artistic value to avoid any mediocrity. After discussion, it was decided to alternate symphony and lighter concerts four times during the winter season. The symphony concerts will be held on October 13 and October 27, with ticket prices of 2 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 6 jiao. The ordinary concerts will be held on October 20 and October 3, with ticket prices of 1 yuan and 5 jiao. The above suggestions have been approved by the board of directors.</p>

<h3>Flourishing Business of China Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>The China-Philippines Tobacco Company, founded by prominent overseas Chinese merchants in the Philippines, Lin Chaopin, Lin Shuyan, Li Yanquan, and others upon their return to China, has been officially open since the 20th of last month. Its White House brand cigars and cigarillos, Hero brand cigarettes, and Black Girl Little Luzon sweet paper cigarettes all use 담배(tobacco) from the company's own tobacco fields in the famous tobacco-producing region of the Philippine Islands. The aroma is fragrant, rich, and mellow. The White House brand cigars use cigar leaves from Georgia, USA, for the outer wrapper. The manufacturing of all products uses the latest machinery, and packaging is also done entirely by machines, without human contact, ensuring cleanliness and hygiene. They are truly the best of all kinds of cigarettes on the market. Therefore, sales are very strong, especially for the White House and Hero brands, with orders from various places outside the city arriving in such large quantities that the company is unable to keep up with the demand. Consequently, they have had to increase production to meet the enthusiastic needs of the market.</p>
<h3>The Honor of Bingxun Shorthand</h3>
<p>Bingxun Chinese shorthand was invented by Mr. Yang Bingxun, a master's graduate from the United States. While Mr. Yang established a school to teach his unique shorthand technique, he also used shorthand as a powerful tool to serve society. His outstanding achievements have long been renowned in Shanghai. This year, in response to requests from people in Hangzhou, he specifically established a branch school in Hangzhou. After three months of classes, the students were able to apply shorthand in practical situations. When the Zhejiang Provincial People's Education Hall held a lecture on electrical knowledge and invited experts to speak, the People's Education Hall specifically requested students from the school to take shorthand notes and record the lectures. The People's Education Hall recognized that this was something that ordinary note-taking could not achieve. In addition to praise, they specifically presented the school with a silver shield inscribed with the four characters "De Xin Ying Shou (得心應手)", meaning "skillful and easy to use", as a memento. This also demonstrates the effectiveness of the school's teaching.</p>

The sports ground, gymnasium, swimming pool, and other facilities built by the municipal government this time have all been completed. The swimming pool was originally scheduled to open at the end of August, but was postponed due to incomplete equipment installation. Therefore, the opening ceremony is now scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 8th of this month. The Mayor has personally inspected the swimming pool several times and is satisfied with all the projects. He hopes that after the opening, large-scale citywide swimming competitions and international swimming competitions will be held to attract attention from all sectors and promote swimming. However, due to the short time and rushed preparations, in addition to inviting figures from the sports world and other sectors to attend the opening ceremony, 2,500 entrance tickets have been printed, each sold for 20 cents. Everyone must enter the venue with an invitation or ticket to show restrictions. A performance will be held after the opening ceremony, with swimming athletes from this city who participated in the National Games participating in the performance. Various preparations are currently underway. I also ask all experts to express their opinions and do their utmost to promote swimming."

Zhang also said that his literary thoughts have changed slightly in recent years. Although his earlier novels were popular and sold over 80,000 copies, he personally felt they were superficial.

Zhang is a well-known novelist in China. His short story "A Lian" has been translated into Russian by B. Perlov, "Peach-Colored Clothes" has been translated into English by Qin Mengshi, and "Three Kinds of Essays" has been selected and translated into English by William Allen. He has written many works related to children's education in recent years, gaining fame both domestically and internationally.

<h3>Little Men (36)</h3>
<p>— Original work by Ms. Alcott of the United States, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Mr. Bhaer smiled, but shook his head.</p>
<p>"I now have a better way: I have tried it once, and it has been quite effective. Listen, if you tell a lie, I will not punish you, but you must punish me."</p>
<p>Ned was startled by this strange idea and asked, how so?</p>
<p>"You must strike me heavily in that old way; I can hardly do it myself, but making me suffer will make you remember it more than if you felt the pain yourself."</p>
<p>"Hit! You, I can't!" Ned cried.</p>
<p>"Then watch that flip-flopping tongue of yours. I certainly don't want to suffer, but to save you from that fault, I'd rather endure the pain."</p>
<p>This proposal moved Ned so much that from then on, he guarded his lips for a long time, trying to be honest and not careless. Mr. Bhaer judged correctly that Ned loved his idea more than his own fear. But unfortunately! One day Ned failed again, so when the fiery Emilie angrily accused him, saying that if Ned had trampled on his best pile of millet in the garden, he would beat him severely, Ned declared that it wasn't him. He dared not admit that he had indeed run through Emilie's enclosure last night while chasing down the guests.</p>

<h3>Financial: Major Players Strongly Buying; Gold Market Recovers 6.9 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market has been declining for several days, but major players have been buying up successively and fiercely, resulting in a shortage of chips, which caused a reaction and a rising trend. Yesterday, the foreign silver market rose and then fell, but sentiment was positive. Major players continued to buy bars, breaking through 80 yuan. In the early morning, overseas silver markets, British and American, were flat, but local sources said that the U.S. did not want to follow suit after the close, so there were transactions below the listed price of 125. The price of overdue silver from Montelli fluctuated, the exchange rate shrank slightly, and London raw gold did not change. Sentiment reacted somewhat, and pre-market trading opened at 76-77 yuan, with extremely strong buying interest and difficulty in finding sellers. Major players such as Dada, Huixiang, Hengyu, and Laijin further increased to over 80 yuan. Yingxiang, Yongli, Fuxing, and Yongyi took advantage of the high price to sell off, leading to a decline. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with British and American prices flat, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold price was still listed at 925.2 yuan, falling back to within 79 yuan. After opening, buyers were eager and gradually broke through the 80-yuan mark, but because the banks' selling appetite was still strong, there were many trades despite the rise. The psychology of Chinese merchants was quite firm, with demand exceeding supply. Both Chinese merchants and domestic goods played a role, and the exchange market tightened accordingly. HSBC and others took advantage of the high price to sell off. It was learned that the HSBC Bank's listed prices were announced, with British prices up 1.25 and American prices up 1.875. Sellers became slightly more active and declined, but because sentiment was still strong, it was easy to recover. Soon, the banks' selling appetite became even stronger, and the Hong Kong market turned hard after opening but was difficult to support, gradually declining and repeatedly breaking through the 80-yuan mark. However, the banks were countering at low prices, and sentiment remained stable. Buyers maintained at low prices, and the situation became stable, hovering around 80 yuan, lacking special changes. The forecast for Indian silver, a small anna, was even more mediocre at noon. However, after the close, there were rumors of a certain bank forcefully grabbing spot U.S. dollars, which suddenly strengthened the market. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 878.6 yuan, 4.8 yuan higher than the previous close, then 8.4 yuan. Hengyu, Fuyu, Dafa, and Yongna increased to 9.5 yuan.

Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Yingxiang, Dada, Cheng, Fuyu, and others came to buy bars again, and the price rose to 3.5 yuan. British came out with October U.S. dollars at 625. Zhengchang, Huixiang, Hengyu, Yifeng, and Yongyicheng took advantage of the high price to sell off. It was learned that HSBC's listed price was up 1.25 for British pounds and up 1.875 for U.S. dollars, falling to 0.07 yuan. Hengyu, Hengchang, Yongda, and Dada advanced again, rising to 3.2 yuan.

Fuxingyong, Yingxiang, Hengyu, Yongli, and Huixiang maintained, rising back to 81.8 yuan. Hengyu sold off sharply, falling by 0.3 yuan. Huixiang, Fuxingyong, and Dadecheng still advanced. The Hong Kong market gradually softened and gradually rose back to 3 yuan. Dingkang, Yingxiang, Yuanmao, Yongruixing, and Huixiang sold off. HSBC sold October British gold at 8125, falling to 79 yuan. Richang and Fuxingyong took advantage of the low price to buy bars, rising to 81 yuan. Hengyu and Dingkang still sold off to 79.6 yuan. Indian silver was forecast to be a small anna and was still fixed. Yiyu, Wenfeng, and Fuxingyong advanced, rising to 81 yuan. However, there were many sellers at this price who were limited to selling off, and the price soon fell. After hovering, the noon close was 880.7 yuan. After the close, Fuxingyong, Zhongfeng, and Hengyu advanced. A certain bank forcefully grabbed spot U.S. dollars, agitating sentiment, and the price once rose to over 3 yuan. Chunyuan, Yonghengchang, Yongfu, and others sold off slightly, falling to 2 yuan. Hengyu and others still paid. The final price was stable. The highest price in the half day was 883.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 878.4 yuan, a fluctuation of 5.1 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 6.9 yuan higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to the Central Bank's standard gold price, was still listed at 915.2 yuan, about 44 yuan higher than the closing price, about 7 yuan less than the previous close.

The short side accounted for 28 bars for Yongj, 21 bars for Yifengheng, and 7 bars for Tongtaichang, totaling three companies.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal, but the buying appetite of major players was extremely strong. The supply side lacked strength, with only Dalian Gang continuing to sell off. In summary, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, Dada, Dafa, Yong, Shenfeng, Dachangxiang, Fengchang, Yifeng, Yongpulong, and others were on the buying side, while Yiyifengheng, Wanxing, Shunli, Ruixing, Huixiang, Qianchangxiang, Yuxinxiang, Futaiyong, and others were on the selling side. Yuanmao Yong allocated 350 bars to Yicheng. Yifeng Yicheng Yongli Yingxiang first came out and then came in. Fuyu Dafa Yong Richang Hengchang Yong first advanced and then retreated. Dalian Gang and Wanxing jointly did more than 500 bars and netted out more than 300 bars. Shunli jointly did 400 more bars and netted out 300 more. The Guangdong Gang still lacked activity. Only about 900 bars were sold in the half day, and the buying side accounted for more than 600 for Dadecheng and about 400 each for Fuxingyong and Fuyu.</p>

<h3>Foreign Banks Rise then Fall: Tightly Watched Exchange Market Processes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, London's near-term silver rose nearly 25, and long-term rose 375. The ground was said to be that the closing price was boosted because the United States was unwilling to [sell? - incomplete sentence].

Bank listings showed the British exchange rate up 125, and the American exchange rate up 1875, making it difficult to tighten further. The situation lingered. Bank selling remained strong. The Hong Kong market opened firmer, briefly easing slightly. However, because banks took advantage of low prices to trade, it gradually became peaceful. The Hong Kong market also rebounded and tightened. Thereafter, the process lingered, lacking significant changes. Although banks hesitated, most maintained their positions. It is predicted that the Indian silver exchange rate will fall one anna, becoming even more mediocre. However, after the close, it was rumored that a certain bank still bought a considerable amount of US dollars. The closing price for near-term sales was 1 shilling 6 pence and 0625 points.

<h3>GuangDong Bank Closure Has No Major Impact - Dalian Merchants Ship Cantonese Silver Dollars -</h3>
<p>Recently, according to past practice, there should have been a busy period. However, now most goods cannot be transported and sold, and purchasing power is far lower than before. Most banks are practicing self-defense. The same is true for interbank discounting in the market. All discounting is done between connected banks. Any request from other firms not related to the main banks is ignored. As a result, the amount of interbank discounting has also gradually decreased. The foreign interbank rate has been reduced by one cent compared to the previous day, with the morning and afternoon rates both at 15 cents. Clearinghouse transactions showed no increased activity, remaining static. Interbank discounting transactions amounted to over 3.9 million in the morning session, with new transactions at over 300,000. Afternoon transactions amounted to over 500,000.

Due to the impact of the Guangdong Bank closure, depositors withdrew over 3 million from various banks, and warehouse withdrawals amounted to 400,000. Japanese banks' bill collections amounted to over 2.6 million, various goods etc. collections amounted to over 4.7 million, foreign exchange settlement amounted to over 900,000, special transfers amounted to over 800,000, telegraphic transfers amounted to over 900,000, and warehouse entries amounted to 600,000. Overall, the market atmosphere is more sparse compared to previous days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars suddenly rebounded, improving by 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 834.5 yuan. The morning and afternoon prices were similar, and the prices were the same as two days ago. This shows that the market fluctuates up and down, constantly changing. Transactions in the morning session amounted to 5,000 jiao (1/10 of a dollar), and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Due to the shipment of Dalian merchants, over 800,000 Cantonese small silver dollars were shipped, so the market price was firm. However, it did not rise significantly, and the trend was stable. The market price remained the same as the previous day's morning and afternoon prices. The morning price was 744 yuan, and the afternoon price was 745.5 yuan. Transactions in the morning session amounted to 245,000 jiao, and 160,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained at 342,000 cash, with transactions of 32,148 strings, equivalent to 9,400 foreign dollars.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds in a Fluctuating Process, Price Changes Only Five Cents to One Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was very peaceful, without much variation. The closure of the Guangdong Bank caused some pressure due to active short selling, but it quickly stabilized. The Guangdong Bank was entirely related to Hong Kong exchange rates, and the market relationship was shallow. It had been wavering for some time, and only yesterday was it unable to maintain itself. The government bond market was barely affected. The number of buyers on the market did not decrease compared to sellers. No. 48 was actively being bought again. Since there were few transactions, the price fluctuations were also limited. No. 96 needed No. 4 again, so it slightly strengthened. The outlook is that it will continue to fluctuate. Yesterday's process, the morning opening in Shanghai, continued to rise five cents to one dime to two dimes. There were not many transactions. In the second session, due to the closure of the Guangdong Bank, selling pressure surged, with Nos. 65 and 76 being sold the most. The market price fell back about two or three dimes.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Reduced Chips, Cotton Yarn Rises on Short Covering</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable and firm, with a slight rising trend. However, the spot yarn sales market has become quiet due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, and sentiment is normal. However, the supply of standard yarn in warehouses is gradually decreasing, and some short covering activity is occurring, making the market tighter. This is particularly firm, and the distant months are also being stimulated by it.</p>
<p>The current month's yarn surged by 1.7 yuan. The opening of the standard yarn market was strong, and each month continued to rise, with a good situation. There was a lack of new sellers in the market, and the surface was particularly tight. The second session continued to advance. At the third session, it was reported that the Guangdong Bank had run aground and suspended operations, and selling pressure rose slightly, falling three or four dimes. By the time the session returned, it had risen again. As a result, each month rose two, three, four, and six dimes compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening saw the current month particularly strong, and the rising momentum was especially strong, with reports of floating accounts covering shorts. Osaka Sampin yarn had fallen for many days in a row, rebounding by one or two yuan. It was also said that only 2,000-3,000 bales of yarn remained in the yarn and cloth storage houses. There were not many deliveries this month, and the market was temporarily buzzing, suddenly jumping by one yuan.

<p>The cotton market is quite firm. Due to abnormal weather, according to the market, there is still heavy rainfall in the Zhengzhou and Shaanxi areas. The current new cotton bolls are just opening, and the weather is extremely important, so sentiment is leaning towards bullishness. The market situation is improving. However, new cotton from various routes is coming on the market one after another.</p>

<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, the market situation for each month remained strong, and there were not many sellers.

The local situation was very strong. As a result, each month rose five cents to one dime compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon opening, it was heard that Osaka Sampin cotton had risen several dimes, and it was expected that American cotton would have the possibility of rising tomorrow, so the rising momentum was even stronger. By the time of closing, the price for each month had risen one dime and a half compared to the closing price of the previous thousand [unit?].

Futures fell two to eight pounds. Spot English cotton rose one point. Futures fell one point. Indian cotton European exporters bought slightly. The estimate was that flat fruit rose two rupees, Aumra fell half a rupee, and Bai Luoxi (白織溪) rose 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram dated the 3rd)</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 4th for Bai Luoxi (白羅溪) cotton was 191 rupees, the same as the closing of the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rangoon's Cotton Exports</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay on the 3rd, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 100 bales, all to Hamburg.</p>
<h3>Grains: Dongxin Glutinous Rice Rises Two Dimes, New Jiaojian Continues to Jump a Foot and a Half</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various gangs of rice from Shanghai South arrived with a total of twenty-one or two [shipments?] (goods totaling over 4,000 shi). Prices in the city were relatively flat. Qingdao gangs handled over 400 bags, so although the situation was tight, the market lacked grandeur. The weather was cloudy and sunny, and the need for broken [rice?] was ambiguous. The cheap price of new glutinous rice made it difficult for the price of various broken glutinous rice and thin paddy to increase sharply, and could only slightly improve. Each type of new glutinous rice depends on the weather for changes. Today, it is at a good opportunity, and each step is active, with the price rising two dimes again. The Ruoxin (若新) brand from the Xinchang Factory Nanjiao Lizhengxing (李正興) goods opened at nine yuan, and each type of new rice such as Yangchuan were all falling. On the north side of Shanghai, the river underlings arrived with 26-27 [shipments?], and the city's goods went to waste. White glutinous rice was flat, and the market price was tired. White Yuanling glutinous rice was turning lazy, and the high-quality goods in the city shape were slightly less one or two dimes, with the middle grade tired near the corner. Thin paddy was flat and tired. Dongxin glutinous rice arrived with a few live ones, and the price rose two dimes. New Yangjiaojian continued to have a way out, high materials are still acceptable, the middle grade is sluggish, the market price is high, and the middle grade is tired. A few hundred stones of Tuanjiaojian arrived, retail sales were quite active, and the price shape was upright. Although not many new Kejiaojian arrived, retail sales continued to move, and the city shape was stable. The remaining goods were slightly soft.</p>
<h3>Saigon Rice is Still Rising in Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the foreign guake rice market rose and fell unevenly. Foreign rice is thinning due to the thin inventory, and it is not cost-effective to fix it later. The land of origin is affected by the European and African style winds, and the price of Saigon rice is rising step by step, so the goods are unanimously conservative, and the market price has seen a sudden jump in the market price. Xiaojiao and Siamese rice also followed the market, but not as tight as Saigon. Yongzao rice continued to arrive, and Yong rice was slightly soft. Each type of Jiangxi and Wuhu rice remained in a fixed situation. 500 bags of Guangdong new machine rice have been sold, the price is 9 yuan 8 and a half dimes. A total of 604 bags of Yong rice were opened, and 300 bags of Gan and Wu were opened. The statistics of foreign rice was 3,600 bags, most of which were still handled by the city's office, and the inland households of the north gang still have to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Period Flour and Wheat Slightly Show Vitality—Also Influenced by the Italian-Ethiopian War—</h3>
<p>Flour Market: The flour market showed a slight vitality yesterday, although the foreign wheat quotations still fluctuated little (Chicago good by one dime, Canada good by 4 cents to 1 dime). The market sentiment was as clear as the past. However, since the number of outlets was very rare, the inland gangs absorbed it quite a bit, so the opening price was slightly higher. By the afternoon of each Shanghai [market?], transactions still did not seem strong. However, the market atmosphere turned strong again, because it was rumored that the atmosphere of Italian and Abyssinian contact was very strong, so there were outside purchases again, but the amount was not abundant, and it was an embellishment in the sinking [market?]. As a result, this month rose by one cent, October rose by one cent, November rose by two cents and seven and a half millimeters, and December rose by one cent.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the period wheat market was clearing and light in each session in the morning. The price was slightly stable, because both inside and outside buyers and sellers were mostly waiting and watching, so the market atmosphere was always peaceful. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market was stable and spot wheat was held back by the customers, the shouting price was slightly stronger, so each session transaction was smoother and the price continued to be stable. It is hoped that if there are unexpected disturbances in the follow-up steps, the market may have a turning point. As a result, each month from September to December was better by two cents. Spot wheat: Since customers are unwilling to open more, there are not many deliveries. Each stall's shouting price has increased by one cent, and Shandong wheat is priced at 3 yuan 6 dimes and 2 cents, Mingguang wheat is 3 yuan 6 dimes and 1 cent, Yao [wheat?] is 3 yuan 6 dimes, and Chongming wheat is 3 yuan 5 dimes and 2 cents, which were handled by Xinda (信大辦去) 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3>New Beans and Red Grains Increased Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new yellow soybeans rose four or five cents, because they had been exhausted for a long time, and the transportation was tied up, so the source was reduced. The way out continued, so after the owners tightened up, they saw a rise. The same was true for red grain, rising by one dime. Sales were quite smooth, handled by Japanese foreign firms. Yesterday, Chen grain from Jiangbei opened at 2 yuan 4 dimes and 7 cents, with more than 1,500 bags traded. More than 1,400 bags of new grain were priced at 2 yuan 6 dimes and a half and 6 dimes 4. 3-400 bags of Chongming new grain, priced from 3 yuan 5 dimes to 4 dimes 3.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Increased Sales of Raw White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was stable. The guild divided the market for 24 raw sand white spot goods at 17 yuan and 2 dimes, with some transactions. New goods for re-export 5 yuan 4 dimes and old goods 5 yuan 3 dimes were not traded. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Society auctioned 2,200 bags of Wu Yang brand Cantonese raw white sugar at 17 yuan and 1 dime, and 800 bags were traded. 220 bags of Huizhou raw sugar at 16 yuan and 9 dimes and a half, and 110 bags were traded. 2,000 bags of Dutch raw white sugar at 17 yuan and 2 dimes, and 80 bags were traded. [Raw sand and white sugar?] at 1,000 bags, 16 yuan and a half, were not traded. A few hundred packages of domestic Korean Youth were continuously opened, from 9 yuan 7 and 8 dimes to 9 yuan 4 and 5 dimes, and more than 400 packages of cotton red were opened from 11 yuan 6 dimes and a half to 11 yuan 2 and 3 dimes. Secondly slightly [difficult to read].</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Statistics on Chinese Silk Exports in the Second Half of August</p>
<p>According to reports, from August 16 to August 31, 1935, a total of 3,795 bales of raw silk and 1,501 bales of connected silk were exported, for a total of 5,296 bales.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since there has been a shortage of foot-grade goods of white tung oil, the market in Hankou has risen one by one. Last week it had increased to 52 yuan 5 dimes per dan, but the foreign firms were not satisfied. Last night, the local firm received a telegram from Hankou, saying that the sale of foreign estates had already flown and offered 55 yuan, and the foreign firms still did not relax their operations because of the high price. The enough-grade oil in Zhejiang tung oil has already been sold out, and the lack-of-grade oil is still sold at 51 or 2 yuan per rental, which has never been seen since the market opened. From the observations of all parties, the foreign estate in Hankou can be sold to 60 yuan.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zheng Yimei)</p>
<p>Last night I had a dream, dreaming that I had suddenly committed a crime. The police searched and arrested me severely. Deep [redaction] Heaven [redaction], nowhere to settle down, panic and fear, all night long, and the next day, my spirit felt greatly exhausted. Although this is illusory, the life of a criminal is nothing more than a trial.</p>
<p>I heard people say: "In Guangdong, betel nut is used for betrothal gifts, and in Fujian, when a woman is about to marry, she sends lychee." These are both beautiful stories.</p>
<p>A certain farm produces extremely beautiful apricots, named: "Red Beauty Apricots." Such handsome things, I would like to eat them quickly.</p>
<p>If you eat too much watermelon, take the watermelon peel and decoct it in soup to relieve it. The person who tied the bell has to untie it. Watching this is even more believable.</p>
<p>I have a strange habit. Before writing, I always like to browse other people's works to inspire literary inspiration. In fact, my articles and other people's works are not at all related, so there is no need to steal them.</p>
<p>My younger brother, Runsun (潤蓀), admires Mr. Wang Xishen's (王西神) calligraphy couplets, and asked me to forward them to him. Recently, I was honored to be given a gift by Mr. [Wang], who made regular script, which is very elegant. The couplet is also worth reciting: "The orchid breeze is fragrant, the door is often not closed to leave clouds lodging; the forest house is high and empty, the mountains are often traveled with the moon returning."</p>
<h3>Eight Rogue Pictures in the Flood Relief Entertainment Fair</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng (孫籌成)</p>
<p>The Flood Relief Entertainment Fair organized by all sectors of the city has been open for more than ten days. In order to awaken compatriots to donate money for relief, the association posted various shocking illustrations and slogans in each entertainment hall, which are too tragic to bear. The following is a transcription, hoping that readers of the newspaper will generously donate money to implement the recent "Relief is life-saving, donate more money, save more lives" advertisement published in this newspaper: (1) Draw two bowls, one bowl is full of a whole duck, and the other bowl only has a few noodles, titled: "A rich man's meal, a disaster victim's half-month ration" In fact, the rich eat delicacies from land and sea, more than a dozen items a day, and the disaster victims want half a bowl of noodles but can't get it. The so-called one meal and half a month's food cannot be fully described. (2) Draw a tall foreign house piercing the clouds, magnificent and luxurious, and a thatched shed immersed in water below, only revealing the roof, titled: "People living in the city, don't forget the compatriots immersed in the Zeguo." In fact, those who live in foreign houses spend extravagant household expenses, and also want to visit brothels and dance halls to spend unnecessary money. Those who live in thatched sheds have their houses flooded and difficult to live in, and want to eat but can't get enough. On the same earth, it is no less than heaven and hell. (3) Draw someone stretching their hands out of the water in a vast ocean and shouting for help, titled: "Disaster victims immersed in water, unable to eat when hungry, shouting without response, are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, can you bear to see them die?" (4) Draw a wine bottle and fresh meat each, and place them on the table, titled: "Drink one less glass of wine, eat one less piece of meat, you can save one more person, one more life." (5) A person who is skinny and sits on a high mound, staring at the water surface, the treetops and rooftops are vaguely distinguishable, as if someone is living there, titled: "Huts are drifting away, people and animals are flowing horizontally, the surviving compatriots are expecting us to save them!" (6) Draw a high table with curling incense and burning red candles, titled: "Relieving disaster victims is better than burning incense and worshiping Buddha." (7) Draw a vast ocean, only revealing the top of the mountain on the water surface, and countless people and animals drifting on the water, titled: "The embankment collapsed, and the plains became a Zeguo." (8) Draw a city wall, which has been submerged by two-thirds of the water, only seeing the battlements, titled: "Houses in the city, all paid to the torrent, Alas, my people, urgently need help." Tourists who saw it all sighed, which shows that the heart of compassion is in everyone.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise (小西天)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui (張恨水)</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Qi Party High Climbs, Fawning, Reprimanding Petty Officials, Female Authority Makes a Big Fuss, Annoying the Wife</p>
<p>When he walked to the front for the fifth time and passed downstairs, he heard Commissioner Lan shouting upstairs: Has that matter been dealt with? I can't wait. Such ordinary words, others may not care about. However, when Jie Fu heard it, he only felt his heart jumping wildly, and immediately slipped to the corner of the building and listened quietly. He seemed to hear someone say that the matter had already been dealt with. Only then did Jie Fu wipe the cold sweat from his body. He thought to himself, this is terrible, I'm simply making everyone suspicious. If I don't tear down this slogan, I can't sit or stand still. No matter if there is anyone or not, I'll do it. He gritted his teeth, rushed to the slogan on the wall, and was about to raise his hand to tear it. But he heard someone cough twice behind him. Jie Fu was shocked, and he immediately retracted his hand. But when he turned his head to look, a group of four or five people were just travelers walking from the back to the front. They were walking frankly, seemingly not noticing anyone. But after this blow, he dared not rashly raise the hand he wanted to raise. He had to walk back and forth in the hall with his hands behind his back. At this time, he heard a kind of groaning cry, which kept sending into his ears. Moreover, the sound was groaning and continuous, not like a sudden feeling, it was clearly very sad, and continued to cry. So he stood still and listened quietly. This touch was even stranger, the sound was coming from Jia Duocai's room. So he quietly walked to the door of that room, but saw the curtain hanging down, and the windows were also closed. Although there was a lamp inside, the light was not very bright. The groaning cry continued to emanate. (308)</p>
<h3>Goldfish Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Pearl – abbreviated as Pearl Fish, its form can be divided into dragon, egg, grass, celestial eye, and other types. Colors include red, white, yellow, black, purple, blue, calico, tortoiseshell, and others. These pearl fish originate from Guangdong, but the original species are rather unattractive, with pointed heads and large bellies. Although the tail is divided into four, it lacks graceful movement due to its short and stunted form. Only the numerous pearl-like scales between the scales become more apparent as the body grows larger. The vibrant colors and patterns are only achieved after being transported north and crossbred with other species.</p>
<p>Pearl fish are very difficult to raise, and fish breeders regard it as a daunting task. Its ailments include blood spots, red gills, loss of appetite, and floating to the surface, etc. However, if one can understand the nature of the fish, there is hope for success. Moreover, sufficient sunlight, ample feeding, and frequent water changes can accelerate their development beyond normal speeds (but be mindful of stagnant water, as there are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach).</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Songlin of the Ning Shao Merchant Shipping Company is a skilled amateur pearl fish breeder. He shared his new method of breeding pearl fish and generously gifted sixteen head-developing fish, including an all-white variety. The pearls are particularly prominent, especially on the abdomen, the body shape is round like a ball, and the tail is also fully spread, making them much more beautiful than ordinary varieties. They have indeed transformed from the original species.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou said: The rounder the abdomen of the pearl fish, the more prominent the pearls. To make them expand, give them plenty of water fleas. However, the water should be kept clear and changed frequently with aged water. The more sunlight, the better. There is no need to cover them with reed screens during the day. As for feeding, he says: For a dozen fish about an inch long in a tank, feed them two spoonfuls of strained water fleas per day, giving half first and then the rest after they have finished it. At the same time, keep another empty tank with aged water (by 'empty tank' we mean one without fish, not without water). From morning to lunchtime, the two spoonfuls of water fleas may be finished. If there is any left, do not wait for them to finish it, as five or six hours of feeding per day is already twice as much as ordinary fish. Therefore, around lunchtime, transfer the satiated pearl fish to the clear water tank, and change the water in the original tank. The next day, repeat the same procedure (in two weeks, they will grow significantly, several times faster than ordinary fish). The sixteen fish that Mr. Zhou gave me were from the second or third batch of small fish this year. Their abdomens are already the size of walnuts, and measuring from head to tail, they are about an inch long, which shows how well they are growing.</p>
<h3>A Flickering Candle in a Gale</h3>

<h3>A Record of the Monk Liaoyuan</h3>
<p>— Jiachen Sheng</p>
<p>The monk Liaoyuan is an extraordinary monk of our time. He currently resides at the ancient Tianning Temple in Yizheng County, Jiangsu Province. He appears to be around fifty or sixty years old, but his actual age is probably between one hundred and thirty and one hundred and forty years. Some say he is two hundred and some years old, but this cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Although Liaoyuan is an ordained monk, he is not skilled in reciting scriptures or chanting Buddha's name. At Tianning Temple, he has nothing to do all day, so he gets up and goes out at dawn and returns to the temple to rest at dusk. He spends all day wandering the streets of the city. When he finds a damaged road, he repairs it. From morning to night, he does not speak or eat, and he even glares at people. Even if someone tries to talk to him, he just smiles and does not answer.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the ninth year of the Republic of China, I was staying at an inn in Yizheng and heard people talking about the strangeness of the monk Liaoyuan. I went to visit him at Tianning Temple several times, but I never met him. According to the retired abbot of the temple, Hai Feng, when Hai Feng entered the temple as a novice at the age of six or seven, he already saw Liaoyuan, who was already fifty or sixty years old at the time. Now Hai Feng has gone from being a small novice to a great monk, from abbot to retired abbot, and is also over seventy years old, while Liaoyuan remains the same as before. The abbot Shengkuan said that he had only spoken to Liaoyuan once in his thirty years at the temple. He learned that Liaoyuan was from Sichuan, had martial arts skills, and had initially entered a wicked path. Later, he repented and became a monk. Because he did not know how to read from a young age, he only became a monk in middle age, so he did not know any scriptures or chants. Beyond that, nothing else is known about him.</p>
<p>Time flies, and I have not been to Yizheng for fifteen years. This time, I revisited the old place, and I specifically went to Tianning Temple to see this extraordinary monk. I met him again, and everything was the same as it was fifteen years ago. He still looks like he is fifty or sixty years old, and his demeanor is still the same, as if he has the art of preserving his youth or immortality. Alas, he is truly an extraordinary monk of our time. I returned and recorded his outline as above.</p>

<h3>Japanese Summer Drinks</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>In our country, people who are used to eating watermelon will find it inconvenient when they arrive in Japan. It is not that Japan does not have watermelons, but the price is high and the taste is poor. In big cities, watermelons are all transported from the countryside, plus transportation costs, so they cost more than one yuan each. A large red watermelon on a watermelon stand on the roadside in our country costs about two or three copper coins, but in Tokyo it costs more than ten cents. In our country, yellow and white watermelons are the best, and red is the worst. Japanese watermelons are all the blood-red color that we hate the most, the skin is very thin, small and round, shaped like melon. The watermelons in the fruit store are solemnly placed in the glass cabinet, with apples and lemons, and the superiority and inferiority are different from the sky and the earth in our country. Cold food stores sell iced watermelon, mixed with white sugar and ice shavings. This way of eating was introduced from Europe and the United States. It is really a joke in the eyes of our country to eat melon with sugar. I believe that the Japanese have not yet discovered the advantages of yellow and white watermelons in our country, otherwise they would not have tried to plant them.</p>
<p>The habit of eating watermelon in summer is not as common as in our country. The reason is that watermelons are too expensive, so ordinary people have to eat ice water and ice cream. Ice cream is very cheap, only five cents each, so business is of course very good. The ones made by vendors on the road cost only one cent each, and their danger is no less than drinking cold water. There is another kind of ice cream mixed with red bean filling, which is the only drink for the Japanese labor sector. The price is even cheaper, and the color is purple, which is different from the black one in our country. Japanese powdered cakes are all purple bean paste filling, and there is no meat filling. In the summer, warm red bean soup is sold in beverage stores, which is far less than the cool mung bean soup in our country.</p>
<p>"Honey beans are drinks in early summer and new autumn, just like cool powder in our country, but they are cut into very small squares, and the form is more beautiful. In addition, they are mixed with black jelly and soft candy, and the color is very beautiful. If the cool powder in our country can be improved by scientific methods, it may become a good drink for civilians.</p>
<p>Iced milk is also a good summer drink, especially for Chinese students. Japanese people only use a bowl of sauce soup for breakfast. Our people cannot swallow it, so they have to eat milk bread. Milk in Japan is very cheap, the cheapest is only five cents a bottle, and most of them are disinfected by low temperature sterilization. However, the newspaper published the health department's inspection of the milk from various companies, and one-third of them did not meet the standard, and some of them contained water and germs. Japanese merchants are famous for their honesty, but this kind of malpractice cannot be avoided. Black tea is a common drink in our country, but in Japan it is very precious and is considered a favorite of Westerners, equal to coffee and cocoa. In summer, there is iced black tea, which is mixed with white sugar and fruit juice, and a slice of lemon floats on the surface. The taste is indeed similar to cocoa and coffee, and the tea taste has been lost.</p>
<p>Our people have cheap watermelons and various drinks, but the Japanese generally do not have cheap and suitable drinks. Watching the customers of cold food stores come and go in an endless stream, they have to drink a cup of light and tasteless tap water to temporarily cool their body and mind. So in fact, the suffering that Japanese people suffer from the heat is more profound than in our country.</p>
<h3>Record of Lingering Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>About half an hour before going to bed, after the Empress Dowager washed off those egg whites with scented soap and clear water, she had to apply another kind of liquid, which was also invented by the Empress Dowager herself. The method of making it is as follows:</p>
<p>The manufacturing process is not very complicated, but the set of utensils is very special. Its structure is roughly the same as the modern distiller. The whole is made of copper. There are three cylinders in a row: the first cylinder is filled with a little water and alcohol, and steamed with a very gentle flame. Then the water vapor evaporated by the alcohol and water flows into the first cylinder through a very thin copper tube. The second cylinder is full of many camellias, and a fire is also burning below. After the water vapor flowing from the first cylinder is mixed with these camellias and steamed for a meal, it will naturally evaporate into a kind of water vapor again. This kind of water vapor will flow into the third cylinder through another thin copper tube; the water vapor obtained at this time is already the essence of alcohol, water and camellias mixed together, and it is full of floral fragrance, almost like the perfume essence we are used to. Moreover, it takes a lot of effort to steam it, so you have to save some in advance for the Empress Dowager to apply every night. This kind of liquid is said to be rich in astringency. It can make the skin on the Empress Dowager's face that has just been stretched very tight by the egg white gradually relax, but it can also prevent those wrinkles from stretching or expanding. The effect is extremely great; therefore, the last thing the Empress Dowager does before going to bed every night is to apply this kind of flower liquid. (408)</p>

<h3>What is the Future of National Products?</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>What is the future of national products? Some hold a pessimistic view, while others hold an optimistic view. According to my recent observations, the fate of our country's national products industry is indeed good. Not only is there a way out, but it is also a broad road. Mr. Zhang Shulin of Minsheng Industrial Company's speech at the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association the other day encouraged the courage of the national products industry to the extreme. Mr. Zhang said: "The place for the expansion of the national products industry is extremely vast. You can make a living everywhere, and you can trade everywhere. Just like Sichuan, our heavenly land, it is a large area for sales. Because of years of military and bandit disturbances, the place is full of misfortunes, so people are afraid and talk about it like a tiger. Now it is different. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been stationed there, the communist bandits have been cleared, and the troops have been disbanded. The former 187th Division has been reduced by half in a few months. The local order has been restored, and the purchasing power of the people has naturally increased. In the future, excellent national products can be galloped in western Sichuan," and so on. This is good news for the national products industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Weiping of the Northwest Issues Research Association recently sent me a letter from Sichuan. He said that there are 500,000 people in Chengdu and 1 million people in Chongqing, and they are all living and working in peace and contentment. They all need excellent national products. Therefore, it is an urgent matter to set up a national products company in Sichuan, and the local people are very welcome. Shaanxi and Gansu also have the same tendency. "The national products industry goes to the northwest" this slogan can now be put into practice. This is another good news for the national products industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Junhui Kang and others have set up the China Industrial International Trade Association, and Mr. Shen Zhaoqi has set up the China National Products Trade Association, both focusing on the expansion of foreign trade. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Shen are both leaders of national products factories, and they have far-sighted vision. If they can work hard and devote themselves to the work of exporting national products, I know that the results will be considerable. Recently, Mr. Chen Diexian also initiated the establishment of the National Products Trade Institute, which aims to open a door for national products by exchanging goods for goods so that supply and demand are suitable. I also fully agree. This is the third good news for the national products industry.</p>
<p>The future of the national products industry is only bright, not dark, only optimistic, not pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Two Points that the National Products Industry Should Pay Attention To</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>The other day, I was talking to a manager of a national products factory, Mr. Mou, about the issue of promoting national products. He said that in recent years, because of the efforts of the national products industry to promote, national products have been recognized by the majority of the people. This is a very gratifying news. However, in the national products industry, because sales are booming, the following two phenomena occur: (1) infighting among the same industry; (2) shoddy manufacturing. Now I write out these two points, or it can give a loyal warning to the national products industry!</p>
<p>(A) Infighting among the same industry. Speaking of cooperation among the same industry, there is a large factory in the national products industry with a deeper sense of selfishness. It often relies on its thick capital and high position to despise other small factories, arbitrarily depreciate prices, and wants to dominate the market. In foreign countries, because their national economy is strong, there is of course no problem. But we must never do this in China. In such a young national industry, we must strive to create and cannot destroy each other! When national products compete with foreign products, the large factory seems to be a powerful general, and the small factory seems to be a brave soldier. The two should be connected to each other, and they can no longer have selfish opinions and go to their own doom. I think that large factories should consider the situation of small counterparts, not act arbitrarily, and should especially join hands in several aspects to find another safe path. Otherwise, everyone is drilling in one business, and letting other businesses be held in the hands of foreign businessmen. Isn't this very ridiculous? In short, unity is strength. The strength of our national products lies in the elimination of selfish opinions and mutual unity among the national product counterparts.</p>
<p>(B) Shoddy manufacturing is a matter of cutting off one's own way. Because of the mutual infighting and depreciation and cheap sales of the national products industry, on the one hand, in order to reduce costs, they have to cut corners and shoddy manufacturing. Some friends who use national products for the first time often show me a damaged national product tool and say, "You persuaded me to use national products, which is also good. But this thing will break immediately if you touch it lightly. Do you think Chinese goods can be used?" These words are of course wrong, but it is true that our national products industry does not seek improvement. It must be known that disappointing customers is the first step in closing the store. My opinion is that it is better to work hard to improve than to spend a lot of money to publish advertisements that deceive people for a while. Isn't this much more brilliant? The national product counterparts want to depreciate prices and engage in infighting to attract customers, it is better to use improved products to give people in the society a deep understanding!</p>
<p>This is a very obvious example. Chinese tea and Chinese silk originally occupied a lot of power in foreign markets, but because the counterparts did not cooperate with each other and the improvement was not very satisfactory to foreigners, now the business is almost plummeting. Our wise national product gentlemen, knowing this lesson from the past, should know how to seek the stability of the industry and find a new path so that our market will not be manipulated by others!</p>
<h3>Suggestions that Local Public Education Centers Should Have National Product Propaganda</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>In recent years, the establishment of public education centers in various places has undoubtedly been rising like a storm and gradually become common, especially in the inland villages and towns. According to my investigation during this return to my hometown - in several small towns in western Zhejiang, I deeply know that the public education center is actually the most powerful guide for improving life in the minds of local people. Villagers always come here in their spare time to visit! Reading books and newspapers! It has become his only spiritual rest place, and here, I also took the opportunity to investigate whether national product education has been implemented, but it made me very disappointed, because most of them do not even have the words "national product saves the country", which is a great regret, which aroused my need to suggest to public education centers in various places that they must have the mission of promoting national products.</p>
<p>Originally, public education centers must be responsible for making people's lives in each place better. Therefore, at this time when China's rural areas are bankrupt, the inland economy is collapsing, and foreign goods are being sold deeply into the people and penetrating everywhere, everyone knows that we can only save the people of the whole country from starvation and bankruptcy by advocating national products and developing production. The public education center should make greater efforts to teach the public to improve their lives and to cultivate national product education to everyone, at least to make the farmers, who account for more than 80% of the total population of our country, unite as one, reject foreign goods and advocate domestic products, eliminate the huge import surplus of our country over the years, and prosper the industry and commerce and stabilize the national economy.</p>
<p>Now, I will write down the several national product propaganda facilities that I hope public education centers in various places should have according to my own opinions:</p>
<p>(1) A local native product exhibition hall should be set up. A special room should be set up to display various local native products, so that people from other places can know the characteristics of various local native products when they visit, and there is a meaning of elaborating native products and making those engaged in native products have the meaning of striving for perfection.</p>
<p>(2) A machine-made national product display area should be set up. We know that native products are mostly local agricultural products or hand-made products, and at this time when foreign machine-made products are being sold deeply into the inland, we really need to set up a national product machine-made product display area to solicit samples from various factories in Shanghai for display, so that the local public can know the exquisite national products and become familiar with trademarks and commodity names, which is easy to purchase.</p>
<p>(3) More national product education should be carried out to the public, such as using the time when many people are in the hall to hold national product speeches, national product makeup performances, etc., and should paste more national product slogans, national product pictures, national product statistics, etc. on the walls to awaken the public with alarming sentences.</p>
<h3>How to Make Students Use National Products</h3>
<p>— Gu Jinzao</p>
<p>In the past 100 years, China has suffered greatly from the economic aggression of imperialism, which has put the national economy in a desperate situation and the future of the nation in jeopardy! Seeing this, the Chinese people have launched a movement to boycott foreign goods and promote national products in order to seek fundamental relief and save the current crisis! The government has also designated this year as the National Product Year for Students, so that it can start from the students across the country, because students are the intellectuals of the country, take the lead by example, and advocate in advance, so that the group can imitate and practice! We sincerely hope that this year's National Product Year for Students will have considerable results. I hereby draft several simple and easy-to-implement methods for national schools to adopt:</p>
<p>(1) School environment arrangement: The environment has a great influence on human life. To make students use national products, we must first arrange a suitable environment, such as posting various alarming slogans or unified needle tables (such as the National Product Industry Investigation Statistics Table, China's Loss Statistics from Economic Compensation to Various Countries, and Comparison Table of Foreign Goods Import and National Goods Export). In addition, we can also hang posters, such as photographs of various national products and production techniques, and display physical objects, such as collecting various daily necessities that belong to national products and non-national products, so that they will be alerted for life!</p>
<p>(2) Assembly training: In every commemorative week, weekly meeting, and daily spiritual talk, morning meeting, evening meeting, and other commemorative days in the school, they should take the opportunity to instill the concept of lifelong use of national products, so as to develop a habit!</p>
<p>(3) Oath: All teachers and students in the school should jointly formulate a convention to abide by, and hold a national product use oath ceremony. The ceremony must be solemn, and those who violate it should be punished accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) National Product Exhibition: Display various national product supplies so that students can understand and recognize them.</p>
<p>(5) Organize a National Product Investigation Team or Propaganda Team: Use commemorative days and holidays to encourage students to go to various places to investigate and promote, and persuade family relatives and friends to use national products. Students must lead by example and advocate hard work!</p>
<p>(6) Hold a National Product Speech: Stimulate students' patriotic thoughts and determination to use national products.</p>
<p>(7) Hold a Essay Contest: The scope of the essay is like "How to Develop the National Product Industry" and "How to Promote National Products." Other essays include national product-related San Nu poems.</p>
<p>(8) Visit and Investigate: Teachers and students use holidays and commemorative days to visit nearby national product factories or other large companies to enhance students' understanding of national products and stimulate their interest in research and improvement.</p>
<p>(9) Elect Model Students: After the whole school's teachers and students jointly assess and elect one person who uses national products as a model, the name will be announced and rewarded.</p>
<p>(10) Compile and select teaching materials for each subject: Contact the teaching opportunities of each subject, such as selecting and reading celebrity biographies, national product industry invention history, comparison of foreign goods import and export over the years, China's loss from economic aggression, and also study and develop China's national products and industrial research, so that students can have a deeper and clearer understanding and achieve practical results!</p>
<p>If each school works hard to implement the above points, it will definitely have considerable results! Students are the future masters of the country and the source of national life. We sincerely hope to start from the students across the country, and the national rejuvenation is here!</p>
<h3>An Account of Mr. Xian Guansheng's Speech at the Suzhou Agricultural School</h3>
<p>— Wang Piaoping</p>
<p>The Suzhou Xiajinqiao Agricultural School, this semester, following the provincial instructions, added a confectionery factory to improve domestic confectionery. Yesterday, a commencement ceremony was held, and Mr. Xian Guansheng, an industrialist from Shanghai, was specially invited to the school to give a speech, sharing his personal experiences. His words were insightful. I have picked out a few points to share in this publication, which I hope will also be helpful to those interested in studying confectionery. The following are Mr. Xian's words:</p>
<p>Confectionery should be popularized... Confectionery is a common consumer product, especially favored by children. Therefore, logically, its sales should far exceed those of cigarettes. However, in reality, this is not always the case. We see cigarette shops everywhere, even in remote and impoverished areas, while the influence of confectionery is not as strong. The main reason is that confectionery prices are too high, with only a few aristocratic classes serving as the end consumers. Therefore, we must clarify our goals and strive for popularization and affordability, casting a wide net to attract a broad audience from all social classes. Only in this way can we establish an invincible position.</p>
<p>Confectionery and national health... Confectionery may seem like a trivial matter, but in reality, it is closely related to the health of the nation. In Japanese families, fresh confectionery is often given to infants, and a large amount of milk is added to the confectionery. Milk is rich in nutrients and is very beneficial for physical development. If one were to visit parks in Japan, one would see discarded milk candy wrappers everywhere, just like we see discarded cigarette butts everywhere in China. Therefore, the physical fitness of the Japanese people has improved rapidly in recent years, and this has played a subtle but significant role. It is a pity that our people have not paid attention to this, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Understanding confectionery manufacturing today... Today, confectionery businesses should try to use local agricultural products as raw materials as much as possible. This will integrate agriculture, industry, and commerce, and also benefit farmers. However, our people often imitate foreigners. In fact, Chinese Shaoxing wine, with its sweet and pure taste, is better than imported brandy. Therefore, people in Shaoxing only need to focus on refining Shaoxing wine itself. Similarly, Nanjing salted duck, Yangzhou pickles, Huangdai melon seeds, and Zhenjiang vinegar are all unique and enjoy great fame. Local people should improve local products to perfection without blindly copying Western methods or yearning for complete Westernization. Suzhou is famous for its confectionery production, and your school should make it its mission to improve local products...</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Xian said that any undertaking cannot be separated from the "Three Principles": 1. Determination, 2. Ability, and 3. Capital. If one possesses these three conditions, one can be successful everywhere, he said earnestly, moving the listeners.</p>
<p>Huangshan Tea House Opens. Huangshan Tea House, located at 432-434 Xinzha Road, opened yesterday morning. Guests included Mr. Yang Xiaotian, Mr. Huang Bodu representing Mr. Xu Shiying, and prominent figures from various circles, including Hu Yibo, Zhou Fuqing, and Luo Zidong, a prominent businessman from Sichuan in Shanghai, among others. At 8:15, music was played, and Director Yang unveiled the plaque and delivered a congratulatory speech: "The magnificent Huangshan, a famous scenic spot in Anhui, complements the esteemed tea house, shining brightly. The tea is as sweet as candy, as praised in the Zhou poems, and all the products are treasures, as certified by Lu Yu's Classic of Tea. A great enterprise is renewed, and a solid foundation is laid. I offer this humble verse to commemorate this splendid occasion." The store was packed with customers that day, and photos were taken to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>New Bakelite Thermos. The famous Bakelite factory in Shanghai, Gongyi Bakelite Industrial Company, whose Noodle brand Bakelite daily necessities have long been popular, has recently launched several new models of Noodle brand Bakelite thermoses. They guarantee temperature maintenance, have novel and unique designs, and elegant and reasonable colors. They are truly excellent domestic products. Ordinary thermoses often rust, but Bakelite thermoses do not rust or corrode, and are strong and durable. For the sake of popularization, the factory has set very affordable prices. Major department stores in Shanghai and other cities sell them.</p>

<h3>The Romance of Jiaohong and The Biography of Jiaohong</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Recently, the third volume of the "World Library" published the two-volume miscellaneous drama "The Romance of Jiaohong" by Liu Dongsheng of the early Ming Dynasty, which is truly good news for drama researchers. Previously, when Wang Guowei compiled the drama catalog, he had not seen the original book and mistakenly recorded it as one volume. In fact, it is in two volumes, with four acts in each volume, so it should be recorded as two volumes. The Taiping Zheng Yin Pu (Comprehensive Collection of Northern and Southern Arias), on which he based his work, also lists it as two volumes, so he should not have been so negligent. The mistake was probably a clerical error.</p>
<p>The third volume of the "World Library" also published the "Biography of Jiaohong" by Mei Dong of the Yuan Dynasty. It was reprinted based on "Flowers' Array of Elegant Words" and "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance," and collated with "Embroidered Valley's Spring Appearance" and "Notes from Retirement." This careful introduction of the novella on which "The Romance of Jiaohong" is based, allowing readers to compare and contrast the two works, is very convenient.</p>
<p>The novella "Biography of Jiaohong" is named after the heroines Jiaoniang and Feihong. It is mainly about Shen Chun visiting his aunt and uncle. He meets Jiaoniang for the first time and stays at his uncle's house. He often sees Jiaoniang and they fall in love. Later, Shen's father urges him to return home, so Shen says goodbye to Jiao. After the separation, he asks a matchmaker to propose marriage to his uncle, but the uncle refuses because relatives should not marry. One day, Shen is invited by a friend to go to the courtesan Lianlian's place. Because he misses Jiao, he looks very unhappy. The courtesan asks him about it, and he tells her that he misses a beautiful woman. The courtesan takes out a painting, saying that it was privately painted by someone entrusted by the son of a commander who wants to propose marriage. Shen sees the painting and realizes that it is Jiao. The courtesan then asks for an old shoe. Later, Shen visits his uncle's house again and secretly steals Jiao's shoe, which is seen by Feihong. Feihong also loves Shen, so she uses this to ruin Shen and Jiao's reputation. She also takes advantage of Shen and Jiao's visit to the garden to design for the aunt to see them. Shen is afraid and returns home. Later, Shen passes the imperial examination, and his uncle calls him over. It happens that a ghost transforms into Jiao to seduce Shen, but fortunately Jiao sees through it, and the monster disappears. Jiao reconciles with Feihong, and she is able to continue her happiness with Shen. The uncle intends to have Shen as his son-in-law, but unfortunately, the son of a commander forcibly proposes marriage. Shen and Jiao both die depressed, and their parents have them buried together.</p>
<p>The "Biography of Jiaohong" concludes with the comment: "It is sad and painful that young people suffer such misfortune because their parents do not understand their hearts and observe their aspirations!" In the Yuan Dynasty, it was admirable to say this, blaming parents for not interfering with their children's love. However, he later blamed Shen Chun and Jiaoniang for "lingering over the scenery and indulging in private pleasures. For several years, they were constantly worried, and eventually died in poverty! Although the events may not be so, the principle cannot be otherwise. The great virtue of fidelity is eternal and unchanging. Although I initially regretted the two young people, I ultimately rejoice for them!" The air of pedantry is already close at hand.</p>
<p>The ghost narrative in the "Biography of Jiaohong" makes a realistic novella bizarre and unreliable, which is very regrettable. This is probably a tradition inherited from the Tang Dynasty, such as "The Biography of Ren" and "The Dream of Qin," so it is not easy to break this inherited pattern. However, the tragic ending is commendable. There are also some dialogues that are very witty and lively, and at the same time, they can express the psychology of love.</p>
<p>After reading "Biography of Jiaohong," I feel that "Romance of Jiaohong" is indeed a work of a fool. Liu Gong completely copied all the plots of the "Biography of Jiaohong" without abandoning or changing anything, which is too faithful to the original work! Even the large number of poems in the novella were moved to the stage. He didn't think about how uncomfortable the audience would be listening to the inexplicable recitation of poems that were not easy to understand, as if they were listening to elementary school students reciting. Also, in order to include all the plots without missing a single drop within the mere eight acts, he had to use the method of narration. As a result, when the protagonist appears on stage, he speaks non-stop, reading poems and letters like a wooden puppet sitting on the stage without moving, which is how much more uncomfortable for the audience! Furthermore, all the advantages of "Biography of Jiaohong" are not preserved in "Romance of Jiaohong." The tragedy was changed into a comedy, Shen and Jiao were married, and they were originally golden boys and jade girls who descended from the fairy world. After the calamity was over, they returned to the fairy world, so many ghost stories were added. Moreover, the lively dialogue is not to be seen! Look at how "Biography of Jiaohong" narrates Shen Chun getting Feihong's poem, thinking that it was written by Jiaoniang: "Jiao enters the room, just suspecting thoughts without words, suddenly sees the flower note on the table, and takes it to look at it. For a long time, she stares at Shen Sheng without speaking. Sheng says, 'When did you write this?' Jiao does not answer. Sheng says again, 'Why don't you speak?' Jiao also does not respond. Sheng forces her, Jiao says, 'This is Feihong's poem. You got it from her, why do you pretend to deceive me?' Sheng argues strongly, but Jiao says nothing, pacing for a long time, sighing and leaving." This misunderstanding, this quarrel between the young couple, is very well written. It's as if we heard Jiaoniang sneer, "Humph, this is a poem written by Feihong. You got it from her, why pretend to deceive me?" She held back her tears, with an unhappy expression, lowered her head and walked back and forth a few steps, suddenly raised her head, revealing a determined look, and with infinite sorrow, she tilted her head, turned away and ran away. "Biography of Jiaohong" is vividly written: "This is Feihong's poem. You got it from her, why pretend to deceive me?" But in "Romance of Jiaohong," it is translated into such a dull sentence: "This poem was written by Feihong. How can you say that I wrote it?" The expression and tone are all lost. Honestly, I say it's a translation, which is the truth. Almost the whole play can be compared, it's simply translating literary language into vernacular sentence by sentence!</p>
<p>Tai He Zheng Yin Pu (Comprehensive Collection of Northern and Southern Arias) praises Liu Dongsheng's lyrics as beautiful as clouds and rosy clouds; it also says that he melts ideas and casts words, weaving a pure atmosphere, and can be compared with Wang Shifu and others. I think it is inaccurate. I dare say that "Romance of Jiaohong" is a failed work. Not only can it not be performed, but the lyrics are not outstanding either. At most, it is just neat and steady.</p>
<p>The carved edition of "Romance of Jiaohong" mistakenly placed the title of the play after the second act, which should be moved after the fourth act, as Zhen Duo has already pointed out. In addition, there are two other places where the volumes are disordered:</p>
<p>(1) It seems that the first volume should end after the coda on page 14 is sung, "The clown and the female role both leave the stage, performing a farewell scene." The title of the play should be placed below this. Following this, "Shen Boli comes on stage and says, (The line 'clown comes on stage and says' is missing) Little student and Miss come and go at night..." should be the beginning of the interlude of the second volume. When the Xian Lü Duan Zheng Hao (the original mistakenly writes Zheng Gong. The Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu says: "The Xian Lü Duan Zheng Hao interlude is not part of the set number, and is different from Zheng Gong; Zheng Gong cannot be increased or decreased, but Xian Lü can be increased or decreased.") is finished singing, the clown and the female role both leave the stage, and the interlude is considered finished. Otherwise, at the end of the first volume, the conversation between the clown and the female role does not clearly indicate that they leave the stage, and the conclusion is actually a "four vajra ascending to the clouds" feeling. And at the beginning of the second volume, there is an inexplicable Xian Lü Duan Zheng Hao, and it is not known who is singing it. After the singing is finished, the clown and the female role suddenly appear, and then immediately leave the stage, which again gives people a "丈二金剛 (unfathomable person)" feeling.</p>
<p>(2) There must be a disorder of volumes between pages 24 and 25 of the second volume, which is difficult to clarify. Otherwise, how can the female role come on stage on page 24 and explain that she has reconciled with Feihong, "Gradually, I have bought back her heart," and on page 25, it says "Feihong and I are not compatible"? Compared to the order of "Biography of Jiaohong," it seems that from line 19 of page 24, "Little Hui (responds with a line)," to line 11 of page 25, "Female role leaves the stage," should be moved in front of line 1 of page 24.</p>
<p>All eight acts of the play are sung by the clown, which is very appropriate; because the original "Biography of Jiaohong" also focuses on Shen Chun's side. The first interlude is sung jointly by the golden boy and jade girl, breaking the rule of one person singing alone. Originally, the rules of Yuan opera had gradually been broken by this time.</p>
<h3>Seesaw (4)</h3>
<p>— Bai Chen</p>
<p>The white wall blocked the way, and the noise inside was even louder. The little monk was even more anxious and sad. — He couldn't see the ball anymore.</p>
<p>The wall was so long, so long, how could he see it? He ran east and found a big gate. Inside the gate were rows and rows of foreign houses, but there wasn't a single ball. He stared at the gate for a long time, but there wasn't any movement or sound of people. The little boy followed behind the little monk, circling around and didn't dare to go in.</p>
<p>"Where's the ball?" The little boy was so anxious that he looked miserable.</p>
<p>The little monk ran back to the west side. Under the white wall, it was "thump" and "thump" again, and "hee hee ha ha" again. How strange!</p>
<p>Thump...</p>
<p>Inside, countless people were shouting, "Oh...!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a round ball flew diagonally into the sky. The little boy had just shouted "Brother!" when the ball turned around and fell outside the wall. The little monk ran up as fast as he could when he saw it.</p>
<p>"Oh!..." he shouted, his heart as happy as if it were scratched by chicken claws: it finally came out!</p>
<p>The little boy followed, but he was afraid that his brother would snatch it, so he hummed, "Uh!..."</p>
<p>"Don't pick it up, little monk!" Mom shouted from behind, but it was no use.</p>
<p>He saw the round ball fall on the grass, only ten or twenty steps away from him. Suddenly, a wild shout came, "Don't move!!"</p>
<p>A person came out from the other side of the white wall. He wasn't wearing clothes, only a small vest; he wasn't wearing pants either, and there was only a little bit of cloth in his crotch. His arms and legs were like sugar figurines on sticks. He had a tuft of hair on the top of his head, and his head bobbed like a Shih Tzu. The little monk was startled by him and froze. But he thought, "It's not his, is it?" He took three steps and two steps into the grass, and was about to press down with his hand. It was hard and a little soft, and it ran away when he touched it. But the monkey shouted again, "Roll over there!" He leaped to the front in one step. He flicked his hand and kicked his foot, "Thump!" The ball flew into the clouds.</p>
<p>"Oh my!" The little monk stared blankly.</p>
<p>The monkey turned around and ran again, along the white wall all the way to the west. Suddenly he turned around and disappeared.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Street</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Since school let out for summer vacation, I have been even more lonely than before, because all my friends have scattered. Those with money have gone to the beach to swim, and those with families have returned to their motherland. Only a few people have remained in Tokyo. I myself originally wanted to go out and move around, but in reality, I couldn't go to the beach, and I couldn't return home. I watched one after another leave Tokyo with smiling faces, and I felt as if Tokyo had suddenly become thinner and lonelier. Needless to say, the days were even longer than before, and I had a lot more free time. I didn't want to read the books in front of me, and I didn't want to write with the pen in front of me. I helplessly let the days pass by, one day after another. It has been almost half a month since the summer vacation began.</p>
<p>Some time ago, before school let out, I would just carry my schoolbag to school and spend my days in the classrooms. Although the days were long, I didn't feel that they were long. But now, the days are entirely in my own room, and I arrange them myself. I have no desire to read books, and my friends have all scattered. Life has suddenly lost its center of gravity, and everything feels lazy. With a worried heart, I also think of home. The cicadas chirping on the small trees in front of and behind my home. Every time after dusk, I go to the street to take a walk. Sometimes I also go to the tea shop to drink tea. Those waitresses misunderstand people's hearts. They think that I often go quietly by myself and leave quietly, or that I have some thoughts about them, and they always look at me with affection and smiles. Don't you feel empty?</p>
<p>With an empty heart, I return to my home, hide in a chair, and read some news that friends from the motherland have just sent. Because the days are too idle, many unfounded troubles arise. I really want to get some comforting things from my friends' news. I have not been completely disappointed in this, and some friends have indeed given me a lot of encouragement, for which I am grateful.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the sound of cicadas has suddenly come from the treetops, and the "zhi le, zhi le" sound is not annoying. Two years ago, when I lived in Shanghai, there was a large tree in front of the window, with many cicadas chirping on it. They always chirped "zhi le, zhi le." Sometimes they were a lullaby for my afternoon nap, but sometimes they would often wake me up from my dreams, making me both love and hate them. Today, listening to the sound of cicadas, I suddenly remembered the general situation at that time.</p>
<h3>Wandering</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>I've survived the dark night,</p>
<p>A line of red, tender light shines in.</p>
<p>I bring my dizzy head,</p>
<p>I bring my empty stomach,</p>
<p>And begin to wander again in the bustling streets.</p>
<p>The old hat, only worth four cents,</p>
<p>Had run back to the pawnshop ten times four days ago.</p>
<p>Now, I really want to take off all my clothes.</p>
<p>Perhaps they would reject me as crazy.</p>
<p>I have to frown,</p>
<p>Dragging my heavy legs,</p>
<p>Limping and wandering.</p>
<p>At dusk, I lie on the bed again with a hungry body, thinking: "Tomorrow! Don't wander like this again!"</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>The rainy season in the North Country arrives a bit later than in Jiangnan, but it's still the same: one moment the sun shines brightly, the next moment gray clouds cover the entire sky. But even more annoying are the muddy puddles like ponds after the rain, which can only make people walking in shoes frown.</p>
<p>When kept from going out by the rain, I like to open the door and look at the sky, look at the quiet alley, watching raindrops accumulate into pools.</p>
<p>It never disappoints. At this time, the cries of the boy selling peas are sure to appear, holding a broken umbrella, carrying a small steaming basket in one hand, and those bare legs wading through the water.</p>
<p>The pea-selling boy who often walks through this winding alley has a round face with small, narrow eyes. In addition, his large ears, which don't match his small eyes, have a certain magical power that attracts special attention.</p>
<p>This face, combined with the continuous rainy season, triggers a memory in my mind, also of a boy with small eyes and big ears, but because he was from Jiangnan, he was a bit fairer than this one.</p>
<p>He was the child of an old neighbor from my hometown. I knew him well when my grandmother was still alive. Although we all moved away later, we never completely severed our ties. The child's mother's worried face often appeared in our dilapidated courtyard, telling us about her troubles, and then taking a piece of old clothing or a handful of very limited copper coins from the hands of each "sister-in-law."</p>
<p>"There's really no way. A-He's father's private school is getting more and more deserted, and the students are always behind on their tuition. It seems like it's not even worth coming to class. And A-He's allowance for attending the county elementary school is really..." Before leaving, she always smiled apologetically, tirelessly expressing her gratitude, and finally always said:</p>
<p>"I'm suffering for A-He, just hoping he can graduate from elementary school... I'll use the money I make from 'tiaojin' (Note) every day to buy him some ink..."</p>
<p>She often left with tears in her eyes, reddened, and the "sisters-in-law" would also sigh, each expressing their own opinions. Most of them always felt that this woman's endurance was too great, and why didn't she leave a man who was swallowing opium in a state of starvation? But to this opinion, A-He's mother always had a reply:</p>
<p>"It's not like that. After all, we've been together for ten or twenty years..." Feeling ashamed, she mumbled, "He also came from a good family and fell to this state. A-He is his precious child, too..."</p>
<p>This was the truth. All the old neighbors knew that A-He's father borrowed money to buy his son stewed pork. When they were out of food, he would give his son the little bit of gruel that they had.</p>
<p>The year before last, A-He graduated during the summer vacation. His mother had been busy for three months, begging everywhere to find him a job, with the condition that it could be anything except physical labor. Someone had even recommended him to learn a trade at a large business, but she was ultimately stumped by a large deposit. It was only at this time that people heard the woman express some resentment towards her husband: he had already lost all his credit. Wringing her hands, she waited for another opportunity.</p>
<p>During the rainy season last year, Third Uncle found A-He an apprenticeship at a photography studio. A-He's mother happily dressed her son in a relatively neat bamboo cloth gown and handed him over to Third Uncle to take him there. The woman happily expressed her expectations, chatting with everyone, her eyes filled with smiles:</p>
<p>"The gentlemen at the photography studio won't go hungry. This family will rely on A-He to support them. He shouldn't have to take off his long gown..."</p>
<p>As some people who witnessed A-He's mother's glorious days said, she was "cut from good wood." In all these vicissitudes, she never forgot face and politeness. No matter how difficult the situation, A-He's mother's skirt was always tied "neatly," even if it had patches on it. When the child went out, a long gown was indispensable.</p>
<p>Early on the third morning, the heavy rain from the night before hadn't stopped. The sky was still gray, as if a fishing net was covering the earth. When the mother got up and was worried about a large basin of clothes waiting to be washed, there was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>A-He and his mother came in together, holding a small umbrella. They were soaked like drowned chickens, and water droplets ran down the child's eyes, like tears. He looked so timid, hiding behind his mother, covering his mouth with the corner of his clothes.</p>
<p>The mother, with tears and snot, described her son's return home in such a euphemistic way that people couldn't blame him but could only pity him:</p>
<p>"The child is ignorant and couldn't stand being asked to serve too much by the master. But he really hasn't done things like emptying chamber pots, lighting cigarettes, or pouring tea before..."</p>
<p>This was originally what Third Uncle had thought of. It was a photography studio that was down on its luck. The owner liked to gamble, but he had introduced the child because he thought the child was starving at home.</p>
<p>The woman smiled apologetically and said good words, saying that she had already taught the child a lesson and that he was willing to return to the store. She asked Third Uncle to send him back and ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p>"Scolding him a few times is fine, just don't hit him..." The woman left the child behind.</p>
<p>Later, it failed. The owner refused to take him back, and Third Uncle was snubbed. A-He went home with his head down.</p>
<p>Over the past year, things had gotten even worse. People who had been to A-He's house said that all three of them, parents and child, had contracted scabies. There was no shortage of scolding between the couple. The private school had closed, and the child was scratching his sores and wiping away tears...</p>
<p>Those small eyes, those big ears...</p>
<p>Looking at the boy selling peas at the door, I couldn't help but remember that Jiangnan boy, with a similar face and build—just a bit fairer!</p>
<p>It seemed like A-He's bitter face floated before my eyes, following his mother back and forth in the heavy rain, as cowardly as a rat that had been hungry for a long time.</p>
<p>I also thought of the woman's black silk skirt, with large and small holes that had been mended, and the child's bamboo cloth gown—</p>
<p>Remembering my hometown, which I didn't miss much, I also thought of this boy with small eyes, big ears, and fair skin, wondering if he had found a job recently.</p>
<p>Note: "Tiaojin" is the process of arranging the reeled silk into hanks, which is a very old women's profession in my hometown.</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Tactics, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Shun</p>
<p>Enacting a Short-Term Wartime Neutrality Law</p>
<p>The United States, known as the "Gold Standard Country," has always maintained its position as a guardian of peace in the world. Therefore, the United States not only actively opposes the current Italo-Ethiopian War (although it has not actively expressed its attitude, its meaning is roughly the same), but also says a few fair words for any invading country. However, deeply afraid of being drawn into the vortex of war, it is unwilling to be the first to take up arms under any circumstances. Therefore, regarding Italy's aggressive actions, knowing that there is no way to resolve them, Roosevelt immediately issued a declaration enacting a wartime neutrality law.</p>
<p>This is originally the United States' cautious and thorough approach, an attitude of not being willing to take risks. However, what is most strange is that the current wartime neutrality law is only for half a year, from September 1 of this year to February 29 of next year. Isn't this kind of neutrality law too short a period? Because the current Italo-Ethiopian War, although it has not yet begun, according to general military experts, the Italo-Ethiopian war will take four or five years to reach a conclusion. However, the current wartime neutrality law is only for half a year. If the law expires and the war has not ended, what attitude will the United States take?</p>
<p>Will the wartime neutrality law be extended, or will the law be repealed and the country join the vortex of war? I say that this is one of the so-called diplomatic tactics. If the Italo-Ethiopian War becomes a war or does not become a war after the law expires, it will have already been determined. But at that time, the situation of the Italo-Ethiopian War, who will win or lose, can already be predicted. Even the international situation can already be seen. Therefore, when the wartime neutrality law expires, another serious atmosphere will inevitably arise. If at this time the United States does not join the war, its speech will have a special power. This is the consistent policy of the United States. The beauty lies in the word "short."</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the wartime neutrality law is enacted for too long, and the time has come to join the war or to act as an armed mediator, it will inevitably be bound by the wartime neutrality law. It would be a pity to miss the opportunity to participate. As the saying goes, "Long sleeves are good for dancing, and having money is good for doing business." The United States is in an advantageous position and is the kingdom of gold and silver. It is appropriate that its policy is launched in a mysterious way.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A child of a thousand gold does not sit under the eaves, and one who knows fate does not stand under a cliff." Is this the reason for the United States' prudence, thoroughness, and steady handling of affairs?</p>
<h3>Moonlit Bay</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>"Clouds in layers at the Cloud Return Cave entrance, a single moon at the Moonlit Bay head."</p>
<p>Every time I read the couplet hanging at the entrance of the Cloud Return Cave in Shigong Mountain, I will inevitably think of Moonlit Bay. Because the couplet, though only fourteen characters, vividly contains the scenery and posture of Cloud Return Cave and Moonlit Bay between the lines. I love that couplet, and I love the scenery of Moonlit Bay and Cloud Return Cave even more, but at the same time I deeply admire the writer's wonderful pen and genius. If it weren't for this couplet to remind us, we might not have such a deep impression of this scenery.</p>
<p>Although Moonlit Bay is also a small corner of the countryside, it has scenery that is not found elsewhere: a picturesque village outline, a dreamlike environment. Villagers live scattered in twos and threes, and it is almost impossible to find two families living consecutively. If a stranger runs into that village, they will surely suspect that no one lives in the village; but at the same time, when the villagers discover that a stranger has entered the village, they will also be surprised, suspecting and feeling uneasy. Because the culture there is closed, and the knowledge is backward, lagging behind the current era by at least a century; however, the simplicity of life there and the sincerity of the people are worth praising. However, the beauty of the scenery there lies in stillness, not in movement. It has different scenery to offer people for enjoyment in all four seasons.</p>
<p>There, there are towering mountains with overlapping peaks and verdant greenery, there are stone cliffs standing tall in ravines, there are grassy slopes like carpets, there are calm rivers like mirrors, there are clear and gurgling streams. There are lush and verdant forests, there is a corner of the surging Taihu Lake, there is... It is truly as beautiful as a young girl, as serene as a virgin. If a poet or artist lived here, I believe his talent would be even more wonderful, his works would be even fresher, and his success would be even greater. Unfortunately, I am not a poet, nor an artist, so I cannot describe even a fraction of its goodness.</p>
<p>However, I often think to myself, if one day I can escape urban life and return to the countryside to live forever, then I should build four thatched huts to live in during the four seasons: I should live in Linwu Mountain in the spring, in Xiaoxia Bay in the summer, of course I should come here in the autumn, and in the winter it is best to live in Maogongwu. Because the scenery in those four places is not only suitable for each season, but also the climate and environment are different at any time. In Linwu Mountain, in the spring, you can walk in the spring suburbs and go to Baihua Terrace to see hundreds of flowers blooming. In the evening, it is also good to enjoy the scenery in the evening smoke. Xiaoxia Bay is a summer resort. There, it is good to swim in lotus ponds, listen to fishermen's songs, and also enjoy lotus flowers and eat fresh water chestnuts. Speaking of Moonlit Bay, it is naturally most suitable for walking in the moonlight on quiet nights and admiring the autumn colors during the day. As for Maogongwu, the accumulated snow there is famous, and living here to watch the snow is the best.</p>
<p>What I hate is that I am rushing around on the road of life every day, not only do I not have the opportunity to realize this dream, but I also rarely have the time to come back to the old place, so after a separation of three years, I was only able to take this opportunity to run here. But this time I came here, I originally planned to stay for three days and leave, but in the end, due to the cordial retention of my elderly aunt, I unexpectedly stayed a few days longer. "The mountain peaks are green after the rain, and the waves are red at sunset." Although the scenery is still the same now, my travel mood this year is not as strong as in previous years.</p>
<p>Now, the first bad impression I feel unpleasant here is: last year, the impact of the drought here was really too severe, the fields were cracked as if they were deep ravines, and most of the fruit trees were dried up and died! However, this year, there has been such a big flood, and the boundless fields have all turned into vast oceans, the rice seedlings have been submerged, there is no hope for the autumn harvest, the farmers are frowning and worrying all day long, and the sound of complaints is almost endless. Some villagers go to the mountains to collect firewood and chestnuts to fill their stomachs, and some eat bean cakes (used to feed pigs or fertilize the land), and there are even many who go hungry for three or four days without getting a grain of food. Especially recently, I heard that there have been frequent suicides due to lack of food. I have witnessed such a tragic situation, and I really feel a little sad in my heart, but although I sympathize with them, I do not have the ability to help them or relieve them. I often hold white rice and cannot swallow it, and shed tears for them.</p>
<p>According to the villagers here, "It is very common for farmers to go hungry because they have no harvest. Farmers rely on the sky for food, living one day at a time, harvesting one year and eating for one year. Now that the year is so barren, and with a drought one year and a flood the next, what can we do? It is natural that we cannot avoid going hungry. But the most hateful things are those tax collectors and landlords, who rely on their power to oppress people like wolves and tigers, which is not easy to deal with. They know that you have not harvested anything this year, but they still force you to pay taxes as usual, forcing you to sell your sons and daughters to find a way to pay. If you are late for a moment, they will send you to the authorities. How can the villagers live in this kind of tyrannical, dark, and hopeless day..."</p>
<p>When I quietly left Moonlit Bay, many impressions of the drought and flood disasters were shocking, the villagers' hunger and death, the landlords and tax collectors' abominable deeds... all flashed in my mind!</p>
<p>Ah! Moonlit Bay, which I used to think was one of the paradises, has now become a hell on earth!</p>
<h3>Bridge</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>——In the May rain, unconcealable knocking, the Seta Bridge.</p>
<p>This is Mr. Basho's famous haiku depicting the Tang Bridge of Seta in the mist and rain. I have not been to Japan, so I cannot recall what the real scene of Seta in the plum rain season is like. However, when I read and savor this poem with a peaceful and quiet mind, a misty and rainy Seta painting scene seems to appear on my mind. A light rain, a mist, flies past, flies past, and there is a silent, ancient, mottled bridge looming there.</p>
<p>Naturally, this illusion of the Seta painting scene can only be said to be a complete Chinese sentiment. However, for the emotional feeling aroused by this poem, it is more appropriate to say that it is due to one's own strong attachment to the emotion of the bridge, rather than to say that it is the success of Basho's art. I have read very few books, and I don't know if anyone else has used their clever prose to describe the fun of the bridge; perhaps there are many ancient poems that extract the fun of the bridge and melt it into poetic feelings. In A Dream of Red Mansions, Shi Xiangyun and the sisters linked sentences with the line "The whip points to Ba Bridge," which I never tire of chanting. Not only is the tone extremely gentle and beautiful, but she simply depicts a painting scene of Ba Bridge, arousing the atmosphere of the Ba Bridge that is hidden in the emotions. How can one not be moved by reading such a poem?</p>
<p>In the paintings of the Chinese people, the bridge will not be left out by the painters, although it is always relegated to the example of the background, and is rarely used as the theme of the description; however, adding a simple wooden bridge between the forests, houses, mountains and streams, that light ink painting can better set off a kind of harmonious and perfect sentiment. Looking at this kind of painting today, it is inevitable that it will be ridiculed for being incompatible with the life sentiment of modern people, but what I am mentioning now is only limited to the topic of the bridge, and it does not involve the subject matter of the painting. In today's famous lakes and scenic spots, there will always be bridges erected across the streams and trees, and the existence of bridges in this kind of place is definitely not purely for the "interest" of elegant scholars; their existence is originally for the practical significance of transportation; it is the beauty of the bridge that has the lingering singing and rejoicing among the elegant scholars. It may not be too much to say that. The seventy-two caves of Taihu Lake in Wuxi, the large iron bridge across the Pearl River, giving people the praise of the magnificent architecture, will not damage the inherent beauty of the famous lakes and cities, will they? A Waibaidu Bridge adds a lot of beauty to the Bund. I believe that if someone is sitting in a small boat, going out of Suzhou Creek through the bridge: the river is in sight ahead, and the vehicles on the bridge are coming and going, and the roar is loud. He will be able to see the majestic beauty and urgency of the urban rhythm more directly, and feel his own insignificance, as if his own soul and intelligence have been swallowed up by the dynamics of this majestic city.</p>
<p>The bridges in the city are naturally all dyed with the decoration of the city, with a majestic and grand appearance, losing the static beauty of simplicity and harmony, and cannot be compared with the wooden trees or the arched bridges built of ancient-style mud and stones in the countryside. The bridge I like is not the former, but the bridge with a full rural sentiment between the water and trees, with a distant view and a close view, sunny days and rainy days, midday and dusk, each with a different fun overflowing between them, and it will never be destroyed by wind, rain, obscurity, or the mingling of pedestrians and livestock. The Bridge of Seta under Mr. Basho's pen, I dare to say that it is an ancient-style bridge located in a place rich in rural sentiment, at most it can only be said to be similar to the Xiling Bridge of West Lake. Otherwise, there is definitely no such harmony, gentleness, and vague emotion organized in the poetic rhyme.</p>
<h3>In Front of the Hospital</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<h3>Festival</h3>
<p>— Ji Xuan</p>
<p>The cool breeze blows from the distant horizon, sweeping across the wilderness, sweeping across the cities, sweeping across the metropolises, blowing away something from people's hearts, and bringing something else...</p>
<p>Then, unstoppably, autumn, like a bomb, is thrown over, bombing away the heat of summer, and people slowly wake up: there is a high and light sky, the leaves rustle and fall, the moon is cold, and people's moods are aging: what else is there?</p>
<p>Isn't it still the autumn that is so heavy that it makes people afraid?</p>
<p>(But autumn sneaks into the streets of the metropolis with its dark shadow and the black body of the devil.</p>
<p>On the street, people come and go, appearing very hurried and flustered. The autumn wind is gloomy, and it slaps the chaotic flags of the autumn sales of stores and department stores that are floating in the air, wanting to treat them with a kind of hatred, determined to break those colorful flags. The glass windows are dazzling and moving: new autumn clothes, gifts of various colors, and the Kenny &amp; Shirley Temple foreign dolls, each on sale for twenty-three yuan...)</p>
<p>Look at this world: perverted, confused, withered, decadent, everything is just an ugly soap bubble!</p>
<p>And following the scorched smell of "Liangxiang chestnuts" floating in the street, many people began to worry, began to panic.</p>
<p>(Mid-Autumn Mooncakes, Mid-Autumn Mooncakes, Mid-Autumn Mooncakes!)</p>
<p>Ahead is a festival: a hurdle for the petty bourgeoisie!</p>
<p>"Mid-Autumn" is such a terrible noun that there is no longer a beautiful shadow of the bright moon, only some terrible impressions: bills, funds, declining markets...</p>
<p>Looking at this chaotic metropolis with a strange mood (accompanied by anxiety and hatred): a thousand kinds of questions arise in my heart, all of which are incomprehensible: what exactly is the essence hidden under those red lights and brilliant window decorations?</p>
<p>Walking inexplicably on the street, the sadness that the image of the festival gives people is too great: people walked out of the closed shops, carrying their families on their backs, carrying a heavy life, not daring to think too much, living day by day, but it is already not easy! Now, in this year, the festival is standing in front of people like a demon! This is not a game, this is a day worth thinking about and running around with a heart boiled like a cauldron!</p>
<p>(Perhaps the moon on the Mid-Autumn Festival night is very bright and clear? However, who has the mood to appreciate it?)</p>
<p>How many people are there, tired and weak, and have gained the white hair and wrinkled faces from the hardships of life, have lost their livelihood in the bad years, so, when this "good season" of "the moon is round" comes, they have to carry a boiling heart, running around in the wind and rain, going to borrow, saying,</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Looking at the unpleasant faces of other people, suffering the insults of store collectors, stealing a little fragment of life.</p>
<p>"What kind of world is this! Such a difficult year, I have lived a lot of years, lived enough, this day is not easy to deal with!"</p>
<p>(Thinking of the scene of eating mooncakes with great excitement and joy in the Mid-Autumn Festival when I was a child: but this day has passed forever.)</p>
<p>The street is still so lively, and the pedestrians are crowded like ants, perhaps they are anxious about this terrible festival scene! But in front of the shops, even if some of them have seals pasted on them, they are still shining brightly, and the radio is screaming some unknown words with a dumb tone: at night, a nearly full moon hangs high in the sky; she tells people: there is a difficult "festival" ahead!</p>
<p>It is autumn, it is the time of the full moon in autumn.</p>

<p>The Jishi Society, at the request of the National Goods World Flood Relief Association, will perform the one-act opera "Farewell My Brother" tonight. Mr. Xing Junming wrote the play and Mr. Ma Ling directed it. The actors include Cang Yinqiu and Hu Shanshan. The plot is as follows:</p>
<p>Chang Jianchen is an ambitious young man. He has graduated from university, but what he has learned is useless. He is still unemployed at home and has to write some articles to make a living temporarily. Later, he realized that he said: (...Struggle is not afraid of fate. Only people look for opportunities, and opportunities do not come to people. God created food for people to eat, which is impossible...) So he left the old and the young and went to Nanchang, Jiangxi, to find food. Unexpectedly, he made friends carelessly and was suspected of being a political criminal. His mother was arrested, and his younger brother became ill. He had no money to hire a doctor or buy medicine. His sister, Yinchen, was anxious and cried at home, at a loss. In the middle of the night, she watched her younger brother sink into illness and bid farewell forever.</p>
<p>The Yuexing Singing Society was founded solely by Ms. Li Xia. A special program will be broadcast on major radio stations in this city soon. It is now planning to recruit several members. Anyone who loves music and is interested in noble songs can join. Applicants can send their resumes with their photos directly to No. 8, Bailinan Branch Road.</p>

<h3>Silver Pen</h3>
<p>— Yun Er</p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk in various newspapers about the "Flower Selection" and "Dance Selection" of the Flood Relief Entertainment, as well as the election of the top ten stars. According to general opinion, it is more appropriate and meaningful to elect the top ten famous films than to elect the top ten stars.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the opposition, such as putting stars together with dancers and prostitutes, which is inevitably a bit "that," is one example.</p>
<p>A few days ago, for the "Star Selection" problem, the Flood Relief Entertainment invited female stars at the Atlantic Hotel. (For disaster relief, it is very generous to treat guests at the Atlantic Hotel, which is a bit ridiculous.) However, it is said that few female stars attended, and no "stars" attended. Therefore, the future of "Star Selection" is very difficult to be optimistic, because if the stars do not accept it after they are elected, what can be done?</p>
<p>The non-attendance of the stars, if we put aside the high hat of "flood," is very commendable. And even if we talk about it in terms of "flood," the stars have many ways to benefit the victims besides being elected. (For example, film companies jointly launch an entertainment party, etc.) So, why not go with the flow and have a top ten film election?</p>
<h3>Four Sisters</h3>
<p>Several sisters have different views on life and death, and different encounters, so they have different homes.</p>
<p>Here are tears - the deep affection between flesh and blood, the unfortunate encounters of sisters, and the happy family life, the lovely relationships between families. Everything is a passionate expression, which makes people intoxicated and moved involuntarily in a sincere emotion.</p>
<p>The four sisters are played by the four Liang sisters, who try their best to express their strengths according to each person's personality. At the same time, the acting opportunities are also very equal, and there is no distinction between the importance of each person.</p>
<p>Han Langan, Liu Jiqun, Jiang Junchao, and Fei Boqing are all important roles in this film.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy Lianhua production.</p>
<h3>Parisian Box Office Success</h3>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre, after a major renovation, opened with Anna Sten's world-famous "Resurrection." The film was originally scheduled to be shown until yesterday, but since its opening, it has been crowded every day, and every show is full. Those who arrived late felt regret. Therefore, the audience sent hundreds of letters and emails requesting a sequel. Therefore, the Paris authorities wanted to continue it, so they had to continue it for three days from today. It is also heard that Paramount's comedy, song, and dance romance blockbuster "The Wedding March" co-starring six major stars will be changed on Sunday of this week.</p>
<h3>Xin Guang Grand Theater Opens Tonight</h3>
<p>Please Ms. Hu Die to cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony and present the star blockbuster "The Big Family"</p>
<p>The Xin Guang Grand Theater has been closed since the summer for two months. Now that the autumn breeze is refreshing, the interior repair and decoration have also been completely renewed. It is specially selected to hold the opening ceremony at 9:15 tonight (the 5th). Ms. Hu Die is specially invited to cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony. The stars of the Star Company, Hu Die, Xu Lai, Yan Yuexian, Ye Qiuxin, Zhu Qiuhen, and Gu Lanjun, etc., will perform on stage and sing. At the same time, the sound dialogue blockbuster "The Big Family" of the Star Film Company will be specially presented. The film is directed by Zhang Shichuan and co-starred by Gao Zhanfei, Xuan Jinglin, Yan Yuexian, Wang Xianzai, and all the male and female stars. The film depicts the story of the rise and fall of a large family in feudal society. The twists and turns are tense and very moving. It describes the five brothers and sisters-in-law with different personalities, which is especially lifelike and makes people connect. Viewers who love domestic films must see it. The left is a embarrassing expression of the old man Gong Jianong in the film.</p>
<h3>After Feeling the Interest in Movies</h3>
<p>— Tong Yuejuan</p>
<p>I have encountered the stage life, put on makeup and appeared on stage, and creating stories, I feel a little tired. When I have free time to watch movies, I gradually feel the interest in movies. Maybe this is a change of heart, which is a common practice for ordinary people?</p>
<p>Performing on stage is completely for others to watch. Performing in movies, you can sit in the movie theater and watch your own movements very leisurely, which is so proud.</p>
<p>The "Red Sheep Heroes" of Xinhua Film Company is the first step I have dedicated myself to the screen. It is experimental. Now I am continuing to play the role of Su Lanjie in "The Peach Blossom Fan". I still hope for serious criticism and guidance, which I will humbly accept.</p>
<p>From the stage to the screen, the first difficulty is that every raise of the wrist and every step on the stage has a fixed posture that cannot be changed. The action in the movie must be natural and reasonable, which is completely different from the performance on the stage. However, after a few months of pondering, I have lightly broken through this difficulty, and from then on, I will work hard to play the march song, and I don't think there will be any obstacles.
