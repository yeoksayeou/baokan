<h3>中日關係檢討之檢討</h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>中國與日本距離如此其近。經濟關係如此其切。而自九一八以來。感情破壞。相互僵持至於今日。誠如徐道隣君在「敵乎友乎」一文中。所云『···愈走愈趨絕路也。』中日兩國間關係。經徐君一檢討之和後。日本當局。將有無深切之覺悟。有無誠意以修兩國之好。雖未可知。然彼國有識者當必能作進一步之認識。以圖中日僵局之打開。而我國國民對於日本之態度。如何應付亦應内顧自身。外顧大局。作一極鄭重之估量與考慮。而不能長此漢視也。</p>
<p>徐君「就中國立塲說明僵局延長之利害」一段中。首引係中山先生遺敎。以爲中日兩國合則兩利。敵則兩敗。在最近國家主義經濟發展聯盟經濟盛倡之際。尤爲顯然。設使交惡到底。我國固將作歷史未有之犧牲於萬死中求一綫生路。而日本所受損害與我相較。恐將過之。以故吾人對於徐文。固願國人加以深長之研究。而尤願日本方面。細心體察。以圖所以打開僵局之道。　　世界第二次大戰之說。喧騰已久。目前縱爲經濟條件所制限不至立卽爆發。但將來恐終不免於實現。至彼時期。我國將何以自處。誠爲當前最嚴重問題凡深切瞭解國際關係及遠東形勢者。皆爲我國預慮及此。徐氏對此。言之尤切。謂「守住中立···。」無異於痴人說夢···。」其積極主張「唯一可採之路···。只有盡力消彌戰機···。」並···「須將足以引起戰機原因之一的中日問題。求得一個解决···。」誠哉斯言。</p>
<p>然吾人以爲在中日問題未得解决之前。以往種種。如不能作澈底之淸算。匪特日本方面。將發生莫大阻碍。以致枝節橫生。所增未來之憂慮。卽我國有意和平。亦每易招來日方之誤解。甚至引起不幸之結果。緣日本一部分之「中國通。」在積極方面。常多事實上認識之錯誤。如在從前中國革命進程中恒缺乏充分理解。妄加惡意揣測。遂致形成對立之局而不可調解。對國民關係。更盡量自黑暗方面尋求中國缺點。而於中國民族之特長與好意。鮮有理解。因是國民間亦難覔誠意認識的途徑。九一八以還。日本往往予我國以難堪之屈辱。散播民族間恶感之因素。長此以往。恐將兪陷於不可收拾之境地。此種惡因。徐君言之綦詳。此爲日方所先應覺悟者。</p>
<p>頃者世界整個政局。如德法對立之緩和。法意之成立諒解。美國之加入國際法庭種種切切。莫不顯示和平之預兆。減少戰雲之浮動。遠東關係之如何。又何嘗不在人爲。設使日本果有誠意以棄仇言好。一變以往企圖。則其前提。應如徐君所言。第一·『須放棄土地侵略。歸還東北四省！。』第二·基於民族利益平等之原則。成立互惠關係。果能凖此原則。順序行之。則中日間一切懸案。不難次第解决。而當前僵局之打開。豈遂無一綫之望乎。</p>

<h3>對華無侵新疆之事防務已固不懼日本對德關係非常惡劣</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄人民會議主席莫洛托夫今日在蘇維埃聯邦第七屆代表大會致開會詞、抨擊外人對於最近蘇俄處决政治犯之批評、稱蘇聯政府將繼續以同等之懲戒施諸一切敵人、莫氏並謂、蘇俄與中國之關係甚善、並否認國外所傳蘇俄擬控制新疆之說、莫氏以爲日本若干軍閥殊願戰爭、惟蘇俄已鞏固防務、儘足應付、對德國關係則非常惡劣、因德國有侵略蘇俄土地之計劃也云、莫氏復稱、軍縮會議已完全失敗、惟蘇俄仍冀其能在日内瓦之瓦磔塲中造成一永久之團體、以反對戰爭、莫氏演說甚注重蘇俄之經濟進步、謂自一九二九年以來工業出產已上升百分之一百三十九、而蘇俄以外之資本主義世界降低百分之二十四、蘇俄之財政狀况、自一九三一年上屆代表大會以來、亦已大爲改進、最重要者爲現金收入已增加六倍、外債亦已减少四分之三、最後莫氏再論及遠東戰機、謂紅軍數額已增、其機械化亦已大有進步以、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄聯邦全聯大會、今日在此開幕、全國各部出席之代表、共二千人、人民委員會主席兼勞工防務會主席莫洛托夫向衆發激昻之演說、極言蘇俄軍力應續事擴大、莫氏謂近四年中、蘇俄陸軍之機械化、已較前更高四倍、蘇俄陸軍現有更多數之砲隊坦克車飛機、東方之防禦工程、亦視前爲固、惟莫氏承認第一五年計畫、因國防費之激增、爲初料所未及、故未完全試行云、與會之代表數員、曾乘鹿犬所曳之曳之撬、經冰雪之地數百哩而抵此、史丹林入會塲時、曾受諸代表熱烈之歡迎、歡呼之聲、逾五分鐘始已、莫洛托夫續稱、吾人必須思及目前對俄戰爭之危險、已甚於前、日本負責各界久已公然談論對俄之戰爭、吾人並須勿忘歐洲現有有操政權之新黨、公然宣布以佔據蘇俄之土地爲其歷史上之事業、自德國國社黨得勢後、俄德間關係之變遷、無人能熟視無覩也、莫氏次述及然特勒所著「吾之奮鬥史」一書、而問衆曰、希特勒關於在東歐作土地侵略之必要所發之言論、今是否仍有效乎、國社黨言及歐洲新土地時、其心目中是否仍在俄國與其鄰邦乎、莫氏繼謂希特勒之言、顯仍有效、蓋除德國對於東歐公約之態度外、俄德關係上之許多事件、唯參照此種議題始能理解也、莫氏末曰、吾人必須自已决定主見云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）莫洛托夫演說時、評論蘇聯與中國之邦交云、「中蘇邦交、自一九二八年受中國的蘇聯分子之壓迫至於破壞後、現時已吿恢復、中國政府顯然深信、邦交决裂非惟無利於中國、且令其國際地位益形惡劣、或有人焉、需要此種實際的客觀敎訓、惟此爲彼等自身事與吾人無干、吾人在彼時（與目下同）、明知中蘇正確關係對於兩國及世界和平均有利益、故中國政府建議與蘇聯復交之際、吾人卽欣然接受、蓋如此、吾國與偉大的中國國民之間、方能鞏固友誼也、予於新疆「蘇維埃化」之惡意造謠、願再稍稍論及、此項反蘇聯謠言、顯由日本造出、而日本對華政策固已夫人皆知、决非傳播流言所能掩蓋者、予以蘇聯對華之實際政策必須鄭重指明、奪取外國領土之政策、與蘇聯絕不適合、蘇聯對於中國各部（新疆在内）之獨立與不可侵犯、爲無條件的擁護者」云、（二十九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>日本衆議院質問軍費問題</p>
<h3>小川謂内外空氣不安</h3>
<p>（東京）衆議院預算總會、政府與政友會之對立狀態仍無變化、今日會議由小川鄕太郎質問國防財政問題、</p>
<p>小川問、今日事局非當嚴重、内外空氣不安、掃除此種不安空氣乃係政治、故内閣政策要顯然一定、政府十大政綱中、確立財政與保全國防之政綱之間、有無輕重區别、首相對此所見如何、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、國防安全與財政之確立之間、並無輕重之别、</p>
<p>林陸相及大角海相亦作同樣答辯、</p>
<p>小川再問、據聞軍部大臣在前次閣議承認國防與經濟力之調劑、此是否事實、廣田外相對於軍縮會議之歸結作何觀察、</p>
<p>據外相所談、决不至發生戰爭、然則將來海軍軍費是否藉此得以减少、</p>
<p>廣田外相答、余之信念以爲不至發生戰爭、至今尙無任何變動、倘幸而軍縮會議得以成立、則海軍軍費自應减少、</p>
<p>小川問、所謂不至發生戰爭、其意是否對軍縮會議抱有希望、然則外相之眞意、是否可作爲軍縮之結果、將來海軍軍費可行使徹底節約之解釋、</p>
<p>外相答、希望軍縮恊定成立、倘竟得以成立、當能徹底節約海軍軍費、是以希望國民一致努力、促成軍縮會議、</p>
<p>小川問、關於上項問題、海相之觀察如何、</p>
<p>大角海相答、軍縮會議倘能成立、實爲最善、吾人在此項方針之下、正努力未已也　　小川問、倘軍縮會議破裂、豈不發生造艦競爭、一般人民對此均抱有不安之念、因此而給與財界以不安、吾人於茲願聞政府之意見、</p>
<p>大角海相之答辯與上次在議會所談相同、茲不贅述、</p>
<p>小川問、軍縮會議破裂之際、據謂國民非抱有非常之决心不可、此言是何意義、卽請說明、</p>
<p>大角海相答、軍縮會議在未能看透之今日、凡屬引起誤會之情形、當未便談論、各國處於今日、均望不可增加國民負担、所謂不幸之軍擴競爭、惟恐將來發生耳、如欲再進一層、作種種之豫想、自覺未便討論、余以爲軍縮會議縱令破裂、仍可以現在之軍費支持下去、其情形當無多大差别、且抱有能支持下去之信念也、</p>
<p>問答至此、卽宣吿休息、時已零時十分、原擬午後續開豫算總會、因本格會議之時間關係、乃步此散會矣、（二十九日日聯社電）</p>

<h3>日外省發表談話</h3>
<p>（東京）美國國務院、於廿六日公表關於中東路問題之日美兩國交換公文書、對於各方面與以極大衝動、日外務省關於此問題發表談話曰、美國政府公表外交文書、係從來習慣、並非奇事、美政府曾於前年八月關於發表日本出兵西伯利亞當時文書、徵求日本意見、外務省答以除某一部分外、均可公表、廿六日所發表之文書、似係該項文書、世傳其與中東路賣買交涉之成立問題有關、然美國曾於華盛頓會議時承認中東路所有權及財產屬於蘇聯、故美國官方並無否認中東路交涉成立之理由、外務省俟由駐美使館公電到後、採用適當手段也、（二十九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>前作港督著文主英使署南遷</h3>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報登載英國海峽殖民地前任總督金文泰所撰一文、主張英國駐華公使館不應設在北平、其理由則謂、「現在歐洲人士已不難瞭解北平一地、與中國人民生活潮流互相隔離、其地本非中國眞正之首都、往昔北方民族入侵中原、乃建都於此、藉以控制十八省、今中國政府已奠都南京、爲謀歐洲與中國之善意諒解起見、歐洲人士實應消滅以北平代表中國之幻想統一之中國、倘由其人民自行擇定國都、則决不在北平、此凡熟悉中國事實者、均當深信不疑、率平現僅爲位於中國偏陬之一市府、則駐華外交代表駐節北平、自非所宜、惟京目前情形、外國使臣駐節之地欲另擇一適宜之地、亦頗多困難、英國商人之目的、本在與中國各部分、從事平和與隆之貿易、而英國外交使節之任務、更在與中國内地十八省事實上之當局、維持友好之關係、因此就余個人意見、目前英國公使館應暫設於上海、蓋上海爲交通之中心、而又距離南京甚近、英國公使常駐上海、隨時游歷中國各地實較爲便利也」云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英政府推進遠東航空計晝</h3>

<h3>莊嚴議塲發生騷擾</h3>
<p>工黨議員痛詆首相爲野狐禪</p>

<p>示威者六十人被驅逐離塲</p>
<p>（倫敦）下院昨夜辯論追加預算五百萬鎊以充新立失業救濟處經費時、旁聽席中發生極大之擾攘、先是工黨議員布恰南發言、醜詆首相麥唐納、稱之爲野狐禪·猪·下流·惡徒·應以馬箠撻之、擯之於公共生活之外、議員聞之、皆爲愕然、於是旁聽席中諸女子齊起狂呼、「打倒舉國一致的政府」「打倒餓斃，嬰兒者、」示威者方由警察押解出院、而繼之而起者復有他人、一時紛擾不可言喩、歷數分鐘始已、共被逐出者六十人、於是議長費資羅氏乃命旁聽席中人全行離院、衆乃悻悻離席外出、議院乃復繼續其討論、布恰南謾撀政储之前、政府救濟失業之建議、已受熱烈之貶責、失業救濟處現已奉命畫一全國壯健失業工人之救濟條例、按布恰南氏爲下院中最激烈工黨議員之一、自一九二二年起任格拉斯哥代表、曾肄業於格拉斯哥之康登街公共學校、後從事於勞工運動、一九一八年被選爲格斯拉哥市議會議員、現年五十有四、今日旁聽席中咸稱之爲「英雄、」今日首相麥唐納未出席下院、故未親聆布恰南之抨駡、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>本届議事日程</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此次英國國會重開、景象頗類總選舉之前夕、本屆會期中、議事日程所列提案甚多、政府提交議案七種、其中最重要者、則爲印度新憲法案、及失業額外救濟金法案、内閣預測下屆新預算、當係「繁榮預算」、財政經濟苟入於繁榮時期、則工黨之一切責難自可根本消滅、如國會本屆會期終止時、財政方面及政府所設「貧窮階級救濟委員會」均獲滿意之成績、則政府將於本年十月間舉行國會改選、藉以到得人民之信任、如屆時政府種種設施尙未收效、則總選舉當延至一九三六年二月舉行、此外尙有其他各種問題、足以影響政局、使其徬徨不定、第一則爲政府之對外政策、英國政府對於軍備問題及各項國際公約問題之態度、極爲輿論所注目、在法總理佛蘭亭外長賴伐爾未來倫敦以前、國會議程中已列入若干問題、有待於西門外相之答覆、其次則爲自由黨耆老前首相路易喬治重登政治舞臺之一事、中易喬治最近在各處演說攻擊政府、鼓吹統制經濟甚力、此舉縱使不至危及國民政府之地位及物望、至少亦必與現政府以强有力之刺激也、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 徐道鄰</p>
<p>丨中日關係的檢討丨</p>
<p>（七）中日兩國所應認識之要點及應採之途徑</p>
<p>明白了我上文所說的中日兩國的諸般錯誤，便道事變演化，以至造成僵局的原因，而僵局的不可再令延長，則又不待贅言。錯誤的反面即爲眞理，祇要由上文所舉的幾點在反面上推尋，便可以發見中國與日本應認識之點，及其應取之途徑，上文所論已極詳明，所以祇須槪括的舉出如下：</p>
<p>中國所應認識及應取之途徑　打開中日僵局的主動，當然在日本，但假定日本誠意表示時，中國方面應該怎樣？我以爲中國所應認識者：虚驕不是辦法，拖延不是辦法，僵定不是辦法，期望或倚賴他人不是辦法，爲感情而犧牲理智也不是辦法。過去的事，就誤於虚驕，所以今後舉國上下應認淸事實，自已的將來應有自信，自已的弱點不可忽視。再則國家民族的生命是千年萬年的，一時的榮辱得失，祇要不礙及根本，在歷史上也是常見的，所以祇要日本有誠意謀解决，中國祇須要求放棄土地侵略，歸還東北四省，其他方式，不必拘泥，過去懸案，應以誠意謀互利的解决，一掃國交上的障礙。人民應洞明大義，不作苛求，當局應忍辱負重，掬示忠誠。至於期望國際發生波瀾，以爲中國可乘此以求收穫，則須知日本戰勝非中國之福，日本戰敗以至於滅亡，也非中國及東亞之福。目前日本自倫敦海縮談判破裂以後，四面楚歌，已成衆矢之的，完全陷於孤立的層園中，因此也有一部分人，以爲多行不義，終必自斃，中國亦何惜一時痛苦，寗爲瓦礫之塲的比利時，亦使日本蹈歐戰時德國之覆轍而遭更大之慘禍，故爲中國計，處此形勢，更須堅持，且當長其驕矜，以觀其敝。作者之意，則以爲人類意義，不在相阨，而在共存，世界進步，應視正道重於意氣。日本今日之冥行不顧，有類於狂夫之趨井，吾人視之，孰不洞如觀火，然中國本其固有之道義觀念，唯有以自力掙扎圖生存，無取乎因人之利以就便，應知日本所爲，雖不惜以害人者害已，而中國則應堂堂正正，秉持正義，救人兼以救已，如其形勢可能，且當爲日本開覺悟之路，不必存投井下石之心。如果不是日本逼迫中國同歸於盡，中國便應從生路中求生存，不宜隨狂瀾以俱倒；相牽率以共趨於錯誤。若說留得强敵壓迫的定實，可以鞭撻國民之志氣，依我看來，只要國民以昨死今生之决心力自振作，再不像從前散漫萎靡，自亂步伐，雖無外患亦可復興。至於飽受敎訓以後還不脫觀望國際形勢或存倚賴他人的心理，則非但不智，亦適以表示中國之無志氣無覺悟。譬如現在仍有一部分人注意日本對九國公約及華盛頓條約之態度如何而隨之爲欣戚，其實須知所謂領土完整之保全及門户開放等等，如須保障於國際的愶定，這已是中國的大危險所在。列國之所以爲此約定，豈在爲中國打算，表面上無非是維持均勢，保護商業，實際上就是帝國主義所以處置次殖民地的唯一方法。如果中國不能以自力復興，還一味依賴此等條約，則時勢推移，即右爲瓜分或共管的先兆。須知日本目前的悍然不顧是要夷中國爲保護國，其要求爲獨覇，而歐美對於不能自强自立的中國，則其意想中之結局爲瓜分或共管，其口號則爲利益均霑，由中國的立塲言，無論爲獨佔爲均霑，都是國家民族不能忍受之危害。中國所能自爲計者，准有依於自力，艱苦圖存，對於當前障礙，尤其與日本之間的葛籐，應該當斷則斷，速圖解除，而對於自强自存之至計，則不可絲毫懈怠，須知唯自已站得起來，纔是安全之保障。至若激於悲憤，動於意氣，襲用亡淸末年的口號，以爲寗亡於歐美不亡於日本，則須知中國爲獨立國家，寸地尺土不能滅亡於任何國籍之民族。所以一切都似爲次要，唯一要求，即爲保持國家獨立與完整。</p>
<p>日本所應認識及應取的途徑　日本所應首先認識者，第一應知有獨立的中國，始有東亞人的東亞可言，故第一要義應澈底扶持中國眞正的獨立，纔爲日本百年不敝的國策，有獨立的中國以平等地位與先進的日本相提携，而後日本爲能善用其「在東亞之特殊地位與利益」（廣田之言）中國亦可發揮其對東亞的使命。第二應知時代變遷，明洽當年的政策，不復適用，爲澈底更新中日關係，應抛棄武力而注重文化的合作，應舍棄土地侵略而代以互利的經濟提携，應吐棄政治控制的企圖，而以道義感情與中國相結合。第三應知過去中日關係的緊張，中國方面如有十分之四的責任，日本方面至少也應有十分之六的責任，而九一八事件以來，日本爲貫澈主張，更由中日間緊張關係而造成與國際間的緊張關係，此種原因，實由日本對遼遠而未實現的企圖太樂觀，而對於切近可能的解决，又太悲觀之故，吾人相信國際間動盪的風雲，如果中日問題有迅速的解决，至少可以廓淸其一大半，而中日問題的解决，只須日本一急之轉移。日本如眞能覺悟長此僵化以共趨危亡之非計，勿再以浮詞掩飾，勿再製造種種不實的理由，强作自慰自解之詞，即應切實表示其「保全中國統一」且「對於中國之獨立或利益絕不予阻礙且無加害意思」（日外務省聲明及廣田談話中語）兩語的誠意，斷然歸還東北四省，使歸屬於中國的版圖，一面解决中日兩國之間的懸案，這種交涉，當然應由日本率先提議，但無妨由兩國直接談判，定議以後，即由中國報吿國聯，國聯爲維持和平，必樂於接受，同時日本退出國聯的原因旣已消滅，則應重新加入國聯，以消除因退出聯盟而引起的諸般困難問題的存在。如此中日兩國間的惡感，必可烟消，而世界上戰機緊迫的慘霧愁雲，也可立見澄淸，世界人類，皆將受日本之賜，此於日本尊嚴及原來立塲毫無損傷，而一面可免除後來無窮之荆棘，爲日本計，唯此始爲妥善的國策。</p>
<h3>八結論····解鈴還須繫鈴人</h3>
<p>本文之作，旣不是策士式縱橫的辯言，也不是專門家謹嚴的著述，在作者自信，並不夾雜有絲毫的偏見或成見，更沒有什麽忌諱，祇是平平實實的就兩國眞正利害，也爲東亞局勢與世界和平作打算。所指陳的，沒有如何精奧的理論，實是一種平凡的庸言，但世界上眞理之所寄，往往就在這些平庸的道理上面。兩國政治家如果有博遠的胸襟，和深切的識見，即應不顧一切的排除障礙，起而實現上段所說的途徑，以打開今日的僵局，但是這個責任，幾乎完全在日本方面，因爲問題的前半段姑且不論，第來一切解决途徑的阻塞，是日本拒絕一切勸吿的結果，自此以後，第三國或其他機關，固然大家祇好束手，而中國方面旣在國土被佔的屈辱狀態之下，也更無打開僵局的可能。我以爲日本人應知前路荆棘，皆由日本所自造，及此回頭，坦途立現於俄頃。中國古語說：「解鈴還須繫鈴人」，所以打破難關的責任，畢遠還須日本來承當。</p>
<p>總而言之，中日兩國在歷史上地理上民族的關係上，無論那一方面說起來，其關係應在唇齒輔車以上，實在是生則俱生，死則同死，共存共亡的民族。究竟是相互爲敵以同歸於絕滅呢？還是恢復友好以共負時代的使命呢？這就要看兩國，尤其日本國民與當局有沒有直認事實，懸崖勒馬的勇氣，與廊淸障蔽，謀及久竟的智慧了。（完）</p>

<h3>萬國商團訓練之改進</h3>
<p>公共租界萬國商團司令格利安上校、已將上年度之報吿送致工部局、内中對於各單位之檢閱、預先宣示一層、認爲不宜、主張隨時邀請英軍司令蒞隊檢閱、庶訓練得以認其有效、又向來之全體檢閱、過重形式、殊少軍事之價値、應改取縱隊進行式、</p>
<p>增用軍官　從前商團僅爲一營的組織、於訓練極爲不便、現已增用軍需官一員、又營官一員、此外應再爲俄員營增任顧問一員、（已經核准）又副官兩員、（已核准一員）照新式之組織、計有騎兵一團、砲兵一隊、特種隊一組、步兵三營、第一營第二營爲義勇員、第三營爲俄員</p>
<p>整飭槍械　格利安司令主張應僱用一歐美之軍械專員、以便担任修整軍械、兼督飭工人作工、此項人員之任用、現在董事會考慮中、　　加闢營房　車房間頂上加造之新屋、已將落成、此在平時、可備每隊及每組各用專用之敎練室、在動員之時、可供隊員三百五十名之住所、又軍需儲藏室及傳令員室、亦已完成、商團俱樂部、亦已經改建、</p>
<p>需要訓練　司令對於訓練之是否得力、極加注意、界内道路太狹、故實際上多僅爲理論的說明、防守的作戰、與平野的作戰、須經同等之敎練、並無二致、故必有長時間之人員担任其事、上年之内、曾借調英軍及美海軍人員、担任槍械作戰敎練、歷十五夜之久、受訓者有軍官一百五十人、多能以其所得、轉授與其所統隊員、成績頗爲滿意、步兵爲軍事骨幹、第其訓練較爲單調而難辦、故急需爲第一第二兩營、各增正式軍人之營副各一員、庶訓練可期有效、</p>
<p>打靶練習　打靶之成績、上年大體尙屬可觀、惟打靶時、缺少有經騐之敎官、隨時指示錯誤、故每有屢擊不中、因之灰心者、打靶塲增設管理員後、節省糜費甚多、靶子現均由木工用廢料製成、輕砲隊承英軍司令之美意、上年搭英軍艦赴香港練習實彈擊射、惟該隊之砲太舊、子彈已不克購補、兩年内必需改換、最好改用英國之新式三英寸白砲、所費不多、而敎練亦易、應用上亦最適、</p>
<p>徵募困難　現在第一第二兩營中之英美隊員、缺額約有百人、格利安司令之意、最好能練成較少數之隊員、於小有危急之時、即能動員應付、而同時準備有受過訓練之預備隊若干組、非俟商業完全陷於停頓之時、不加召集、如此則團務及商業、可期兼顧也、</p>

<p>不景氣籠罩下滬市地產業極度衰落</p>
<h3>價格狂跌交易停頓</h3>
<p>新聲社云、滬市爲我國唯一之大商埠、及世界之著名通商口岸、市面繁盛、人口衆多、全市房產、去年之統計、總値國幣約二十萬萬元、今受市面不景氣影響、以致地產業極度衰落、價格狂跌、交易完全停頓、新聲社記者向地產商探悉、地產業衰落之主因、爲農村經濟破產、商店受影響、以致地價狂跌、各地產商均不願出售、以致交易停頓、例如最近南京路惠羅公司東首、某地共二畝、係外人所有、欲出售、索價一百五十萬兩、而有意購軍之外人、還價初爲九十五萬元、最後爲一百萬元、以致仍未成交、但一百五十萬兩之索價、並非過昻、依此而言、滬地產之衰落、可想而知、公共租界滬東爲工廠區、滬西爲住宅區、中央爲營業區、地產交易、往年進出頗多、故與整個金融、關係極大、足以牽動各業、今地產交易停頓、其影響殊不小、但預料將來不難恢復云云、</p>
<p>工部局塡高馬路預防浦江高潮</p>
<h3>濬浦局昨發表漲潮時刻臨浦各堆棧亦均加準備</h3>
<p>濬浦局上週發表預測下月四五兩日、黃浦江將有高潮、低窪處有進水可能、現公共租界工部局工程處、因徇沿浦（九江路口起至廣東路口）各商行之請、特將馬路塡高、以資防範、沿浦兩岸之各棧房、亦於事前有相當凖備、昨據實業社記者探得各情、分誌於后、</p>
<h3>工部局塡高各馬路</h3>
<p>沿浦自九江路口起、至廣東路口止、（四川路以東）地勢向極低窪、每於發生高潮時、沿路各户、均有浸濕之虞、各銀行保管庫所受影響尤鉅、現工部局工程處、已將各該馬路塡高八英寸至三尺不等、以防進水、業已塡高者、計有四行凖備庫·電話局·三井洋行·正廣和·江海關·大陸銀行·東亞銀行·中國銀行·（新址）中南銀行·匯豐銀行等十餘處、尙未竣工者、計有匯業局·招商局·交通銀行·中央銀行·花旗銀行·三井銀行·大通銀行·美孚行等十處、昨據記者向工程處方面探悉、各該已塡之馬路、務於三四日内築竣、</p>
<h3>漲潮時刻及其高度</h3>
<p>記者昨訪濬浦總局總工程師查德利氏、據云、該項高潮、必可應期發現、（一）二月四日（卽廢歷元旦）發潮時刻自午前十一點四十九分起漲、至十二點四十四分、漲勢益猛、水流速率、每小時達二·○海哩、至午後一點十九分、則已漲至最高點、數量達十呎零六吋四、（二）二月五日（卽立春節）高潮時間、自午前十一點三十九分起漲、至午後一點二十一分、漲勢益猛、水流速率、每小時達二·二海哩、至午後一點五十七分、則已漲至最高點、數量達十呎零一吋八、該兩日之高潮、如遇風激時、本埠地勢特别低窪之處、潮水有從陰溝中倒灌、浸入馬路可能云、</p>
<h3>沿浦各棧已加準備</h3>
<p>沿黃浦江兩岸之各棧房、因該兩日將有高潮、均特於事前將存棧之客貨底脚塡高、藉防水浸、對於應提之客貨、業已分别由各棧房函吿各户從速提取、否則不負浸濕責任、昨據記者探悉、已墊高之棧房、計有大達·寗紹·其昌·等及虹口沿浦之各棧房云、</p>
<p>連日重霜本市氣候還暖</p>
<h3>農作害蟲將延長生命</h3>
<p>本埠連日重霜、氣候還暖、據一般研究天象者觀察、此種現象、爲數年來所罕見、此氣候一部份係美洲等地嚴寒造成、約須入春以後中國各地、亦將轉入嚴寒、而入所謂「春冷」之虞、更據地里學者推測、在此大寒時期、而無三寸之雪、於農作物上妨碍不少、緣天時過暖、一般害蟲均可藉此延長其生命、在此時期、農户亟應將土壤翻鬆、然後可補天時之不足云云、</p>

<p>昨午新關前海晏輪撞損民船</p>
<h3>舟子落水舢板救出帆船毁壞浦東擱淺華安進口幾致相撞</h3>
<p>招商局溫州班輪海晏、昨自上海開出、在浦江肇事、撞壞民船一艘、該輪於掉頭時、又險與華安輪碰撞釀禍、茲將情形分述如下、</p>
<h3>提前赴溫</h3>
<p>海晏輪原定今日由滬赴溫州、嗣以赴廢歷歲首班次該輪乃由局内臨時提前一天開航、故於昨日午刻開往溫州、旅客乘此輪至溫州者、已吿客滿、並有赴溫州演劇之男女伶人小三麻子等八十餘人、亦乘海晏輪動身、昨日十一時四十五分、從金利源碼頭起椗開船、詎駛至新關碼頭前、卽肇碰撞民船之禍、</p>
<h3>碰撞民船</h3>
<p>海晏行至海關前江面、有民船一艘、自北向南而行開至相近、海晏輪拉汽笛命船避讓、無如風大潮急、民船欲掉搶而不及、海晏船主見此情狀、欲側避則江面有他輪、若不讓則該民船必撞成兩段、不得已便停車稍退、而該民船之後尾、在海晏船頭略爲碰撞、已經破壞、船内浸水、船有下沉之勢、船尾之舟子撞落浦江、船内貨物、亦散落江中、</p>
<h3>停車助救</h3>
<p>出事之時、正十二時十分、海晏立卽停車、並抛錨江中、救護落水之舟子、卽有舢板一艘、抛一救命圈、將舟子拖住、無如一時不能拽到舢板内、後爲另一帆船、將落水舟子拖起、救入船内、撞壞之民船、由水巡捕房之小火輪、拖至浦東岸江邊、擱入灘上、以免下沉、救起之舟子送水巡捕房、落水貨浮在江面者、另有小舢板代爲打撈、損失之數、現尙不知、民船方面、已報吿水巡捕房矣、</p>
<h3>掉頭出口</h3>
<p>十二時三十分、海晏起錨掉頭、擬轉陸家嘴、而出吳淞口、無如船身、已靠浦東岸、船底爲淺岸擱阻、無法移動、海晏乃復倒車後退、橫在新關前江面、時志大·大豫兩輪相繼經過、第三艘爲常安公司之華安輪進口、開抵新關前、却遇海晏橫阻、時兩船已相近、見者咸抱危險、海晏急懸球阻華安緩進、而華安船主立卽停車、並急抛雙錨、方將船身止住、而距離　間不容一髮矣、華安輪因船内旅客有病、懸黃旂進口、海港檢騐處醫生船、卽在其抛錨時往騐云、</p>
<p>儉德銀行倒閉後柴傳貴李經緯等被控案</p>
<h3>又有王汝耀等加控柴李等詐欺李經緯猶謂人欠各欵可抵償</h3>
<p>丨李經緯因供職路局得免交保丨</p>
<p>儉德銀行倒閉之後、有經營地產之衛海江者、原與該行有欵項往來、其總理柴傳貴、因知衛頗富庶、特於去夏遣副經理顧文生往作說客、賺衛入股、迨至十一月間、又以副經理一席爲餌、騙得衛之擔保品方單、及乎儉德卽倒、衛始明瞭、此種黑幕、乃控柴傳貴曁該知董事長·董事·監察·諸人於第一特區地方法院、請治若輩以</p>
<h3>詐騙侵佔</h3>
<p>背信無弊等罪、前次開庭、尙有柴傳貴·謝克明·李經偉·三被吿到案、當經初級刑庭推事訊問之下、以被吿等有業務上侵占嫌疑、諭令移送地方庭審判、此一裁决、對於被吿之刑事責任、顯然增重、柴等寗有知、且該行之負責者、自感覺經濟力量、日形薄弱、基礎動搖之後、遂專以向各方詐欺欵項爲事、故如衛海江遭同樣欺騙或被聘爲副經理、或襄理、而</p>
<h3>喪失巨資</h3>
<p>者、尙大有其人、現衛旣提起控訴、則凡因此而受損失之流、咸將步衛後塵、昨日下午、衛所控之案、由劉毓桂推事繼續開庭時、果有王汝耀等同延陳霆銳律師加入原吿之列、惟所控之被吿、除與衛所控者相同外、增加兩度停業之永安銀公司總理歐建成等數名、蓋歐等亦爲儉德之董事、而未爲衛海江</p>
<h3>調查所及</h3>
<p>故漏列耳、然各被吿旣了解責任增重於前、復聞知被人加控於後、遂更不敢投案、祇一監察李經緯到庭、餘如柴傳貴·謝克明·因事離滬、陳希父向住杭州、嚴子裕·馬綏之·屠開徵·柴友生·則皆稱病、其辯護律師江一平·洪士豪·等、均要求將案展期、劉推事業已洞悉、各被吿無非藉故、當諭知各該律師轉致當事人如下次仍不到案、須依法辦理、並以自訴人</p>
<h3>均經報齊</h3>
<p>决先略問事實、即傳衛海江、訊所訴各節、據衛稱所控詐欺之欵爲五千元、緣去年六月間、柴傳貴着顧文生勸我入股、</p>
<p>謂該行已收足股本五十萬、現再增招五十萬、我遂認購五十股、迨倒閉後、始悉並無招添新股之事、其侵佔之行爲有二、（一）我於去年四月間以道契三紙、交與該行作透支一萬元之担保品、至十月間、還淸透支之欵、向素道契、據柴云、已轉押於</p>
<h3>致祥錢莊</h3>
<p>允於短期内贖還、嗣雖於十二月三日贖出、但又被押於四行儲蓄會、且將押欵由二萬增至六萬、（二）十月間柴又遣顧來請求我任副經理、當將北新涇一百十畝之方單交付、作爲担保品、詎亦被私押於上海銀行、得欵六萬元、我則到行一日、以無事可辦、遂未再去、但副經理聘書、迄未之見、所謂背信者、我旣與訂</p>
<h3>透支萬金</h3>
<p>之約、且有保證品、乃其於我支欵至七八千元之際、即將我所出支票、退而不兌、至於無弊行爲、則屬揑造假賬、抵押本行股票等等、繼訊其餘原吿王汝耀等、則稱所控爲僞造賬目及詐欺取財兩點、該銀行號稱收足股欵五千萬、其實僅行三十萬、而倒閉時、復對知已之股東收回所發股票、俾其免負股東責任、收項所</p>
<h3>收回股票</h3>
<p>約有十餘萬之多、俱有姓名可以稽考、如梁耀庭者、即屬被收回股票之股東一份子、故其股本簿之記載、皆係僞造、我於十一月二十五日、以道契兩紙、向該行抵押二萬三千元、此次倒閉後、方知其賬簿内登記押欵數額爲五萬元、且復將該道契私押於上海銀行、所押亦爲五萬元、更將我寄存之他種股票、私押於華安保險公司、得欵五千元、該銀行現</p>
<h3>有副經理</h3>
<p>四人、襄理兩名云云、質之被吿李經偉供、充該行監察、此次停業、實因現欵吿罄、無法週轉所致、倘人欠各欵、能悉數收回、對債務似可相抵、並稱衛對銀行向極帮助、而銀行亦嘗爲彼作保、其方單道契、均係衛自願借給銀行抵押欵項、蓋若不得其同意、則不能過户也、劉推事遂諭改期二月九日下午再訊、李經偉服務路局、旣有職業、免予取保、</p>

<h3>民國二十四年上海市政設施之方針（續）</h3>
<p>市府擴大紀念週吳市長報吿</p>
<p>（二）解决人力車問題　人力車問題、已成爲今日上海市的一個重要問題、凡是關心社會問題的人、莫不在那裏竭其聰明才力、苦心研究、想如何的來改善人力車制度、如何的來改善人力車夫的生活、不僅關心社會問題的人在大研究、就是公共租界的外人、也都在那裏熱心研究、黃包車夫是中國人、他們那種痛苦的情形、應該爲我們所深知、他們終日拉着車在街路上跑、不管力竭氣喘、也不管風吹雨淋、或者在如火一船炙熱的烈日之下、和幾已融化燙足的柏油路上、仍然照樣的跑着不休、甚至有辛苦終日、而不獲溫飽的、因此有許多經過上海的外人、看到如此情形、來對我說、你們爲什麽不改善黃包車夫如牛馬般的生活、爲什麽不設法解决這個問題、誠然、這的確是急待我們設法來解决的社會問題、我們固然知道、在事實上、還是不能完全取消黃包車、但是這個制度、與車夫的生活、我們却不能因此而不加注意、不加改善、所以這也是今年上海市政府同人所應努力注意、而義不容辭的責任、我現在有一個意見提出來、請大家研究我想第一步、先在市區内、試辦人力車夫合作社、最初以車爲政府所有、將來逐漸成爲政府與黃包車夫所共有、再這一步、使爲黃包車夫所有、以達到「車夫有其車」的目的、我們的方法和步驟、大槪是如此、這不獨可以改良了黃包車的制度、也可以改善了黃包車夫的待遇和生活、這樣人力車問題、或者可以得到一個解决、這也是我們政府爲人民實際上、所應該做的工作、希望市政府同人、大家公同研究、務必在今年要見諸實行、這是今年上海市政府同人所應努力者二、　　（三）提昌生產敎育　關於這個問題、去年我與潘局長已三番五次的討論過、並且要在今年來實行的、中國自舉辦新學到現在、已有三四十年之久、三四十年來新敎育的結果、還不能滿足我們的期望、這一方面固是由於我們敎育制度與敎育精神的錯誤、同時也是因爲我们中國人的舊思想、到現在還沒有完全變改的緣故、這種舊思想、就是以爲讀書人是穿長衫用筆的、不讀書的人是穿短褂子種田做工的、因此形成一個讀書人不生產、生產者不讀書的現象、這不能不說是三四十年來提倡新學的失敗所在、所以在六七年前、我在中山縣的時候、我曾向中山縣訓政委員會提出一個提案、我想將中山縣各區的學校完全改革一下、除了縣立的高小以外、所有其他學校、一律改爲職業學校、我的意思、不但要使農村裏的人、個個都能知產、並且還想培養農村的中堅人才、來辦理地方自治、現在中國的農村、有兩個危險的病象、一是農村子弟、這了學校讀書、就不去種田、非但不去種田、並且離開了家鄕、向縣城裏跑、再由縣城向都市裏去、故農村敎育發展的結果、便使農村的人口一天一天地减少、農村的生產份子、也一天一天减少、農村的生產、當然也隨之銳减、從而使農村經濟、日趨崩潰、二是現在的農村裏、簡直沒有人可辦自治、在農村裏生產的人不受敎育、受敎育的人、都離開農村到都市裏去、旣不事生產、又不能爲他的家鄕服務、在從前還有土豪劣紳來辦地方事情、土豪劣紳魚肉鄕民、固應打倒、然而現在土豪劣紳打倒了、却沒有繼起之人來辦地方事業、爲地方服務、非惟地方自治無法推行、且使農村日漸空虚、這兩種農村的病象、實在是農村破產的最大原因、我們要挽救現在農村的病象、避免農村的崩潰、就非實施生產敎育、改革過去敎育的錯誤不爲功、所以本市想在今年來實施生產敎育、開辦職業中學一所、並將上海市區近郊、分爲東南西北四區、每區增設一以農村爲中心的職業小學、每一小學、附設一個農塲、一爲園藝、一爲菓木、一爲稻作、一爲畜牧、各位同志、要知道上海是有三百四五十萬人口的大都市、上海每天所消耗的農產物、爲數極大、如蔬菜仁菓子之類、固不必說、單是花草一項、據調查統計、每天的消耗、已達一萬元之鉅、這大量的農產物、大都是要上海近郊供給的、而現在上海近郊的農民、大都種植不得其法、物產不能豐收、以致利棄於地、殊覺可惜、所以我們想在東南西北四區職業小學内、附設各種農塲、使上海四郊農民子弟、除了受到普通的敎育以外、又可得到種種生產的知職與技能、不但如此、並且還可使農村中年老的農民、也得到一個機會、增加他們的農事知職、以求改進農業生產的方法、此外我們還要設一個比較完備的職業中學、以爲農民子弟深造之所、至於其他各處學校、我們也想逐步加以改善、這是今年上海市政府同人所應努力者三、</p>
<p>（四）國民軍事訓練　現在上海的軍事訓練、大家都知道、祇限於各校和保衛團方面、大半是因陋就簡、甚或有名無實、不能副我們的期望、所以今年關於國民軍事訓練、我們想定出一個新的制度和辦法、分期輪流、集中來訓練、不是僅僅在學校裏或保衛團裏訓練、就算了事、一定要訓練得使我們一般國民散漫凌亂、萎靡不振的生活、澈底的紀律化、集團化、軍隊化、以根本刷新我們民族的精神、充實我們國民自衛的能力、這是今年上海市政府同人所應努力者四、</p>
<p>（五）普及民衆敎育　、普及敎育、是發展國力、推動市政的基本工作、現在上海全市、我們粗粗的估計、三百四五十萬市民之中、約有百分之二十五的成年人不識字、卽所謂文盲、現在中央已决定普及民衆敎育的方案、我們現在就要以一年的時間、來使本市的成年人受敎育、以解决文盲問題、其計劃擬先將本市十五歲至三十歲不識字的人、在今年一年之内、設法先敎他們識字、然後再授以最低限度公民所應具的常識、以樹立發展國力、推進市政的基礎、這是今年上海市政府同人所應努力者五、</p>
<p>（六）修建塘工　本市塘工、因年久失修、圯毁日甚、每年到七八月的時候、沈局長總來請欵修理、市府雖在財力奇絀的時候、終是要撥欵興修、但因爲經費有限、時修時圯、到現在還不能不引爲隱憂、所以我們想在今年如果市政府財力能濟、籌集一百萬元、來大大的修理一下、雖我們不敢說可以一勞永逸、但終須使上海的塘工問題、得到一個相當的解决、這是今年上海市政府同人所應努力者六、</p>
<p>以上六種事業、都是上海市政府同人今年内所應共同努力的工作、爲政不在多言、貴在言行一致、行而有效、蓋中國此時所最需要者、爲實幹與快幹、徒托空言、無補時艱、過去本市之設施、雖以財力等種種牽制、未敢謂盡如人望、然至少言者已大半見諸實行、今日所陳各端、吾人究將如何使其言行一致、行而有效呢、那就有兩個先决問題、一是如何籌欵問題、一是方法與計劃問題、關於此二問題、我雖都已深籌熟慮、略有端倪、但爲集思廣益計、我現在特再提出來、請全市政府同人大家來共同研究與設計、一方面研究如何籌欵的辦法、一方面設計如何進行的計劃、而後大家再共同努力做去、使民國二十四年我們在上海市政府服務的全體同志、在今年對於上海市的社會與三百四五十萬的人民、有一個很顯著而且很有成績的貢獻、不要辜負了這民國二十四年大好的光陰、以及全體市民對我們熱切的期望、</p>
<p>今天紀念週、適逢一二八三週年紀念日、故特召集各局同仁到此、聯合舉行、追念旣往、激勵來茲、故將今年上海市政府同人所應努力的方針報吿於各位同志、並望全體同事、一致努力、務使這些計劃、都能實現、總理吿訴我們、「革命的目的、在於建設、而建設之首要在民生、」又說、革命的目的、在乎實行民生主義、不實行民生主義、就可不要革命、」以此可知民生問題的重要、如果民生問題、能够解决、我們的國家才可以富、民衆才可以强、國富民强、才能够充實國家的力量、國家的力量充實了以後、才可以保障我們國家民族的生存、前幾天、蔣委員長經過上海的時候、曾召見本府負責同志、他吿訴我們、在過去幾年中、因種種關係、我們的工作、僅是偏於靜的方面、今年我們的工作、則要偏重於動的方面、所謂動的工作、就是要多做一點社會建設事業、而社會建設事業、就要從民生方面、多多注意、因此我們决定以剛才所講的六端、爲我們上海市政府同人今年努力的方針、並以敎養衛生三者、爲我們上海市政府今後施政的最高原則、兄弟甚願與本府全體同事、共同向此鵠的、努力遇進、以求於民國二十四年内有所表現、（完）</p>

<p>小西天</p>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華廳盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>張介夫對於這樣的事，眞是聞所未聞，半嚮說不出話來，許久才道：我眞想不到在陜西用官有這樣的困難。志前笑道：這樣說來，未免减少張先生的官趣了。介夫好容易求得志前有點依允帮忙的意思了。現在忽然說是官不可做，這未免自已打斷自已的路子。這就笑道：據我想，這樣的縣分，那總算少數。我想，關中這若干縣分，總不會這樣的。周有容笑道：這是誰也知道的事，可是有好的地方，誰不願去？就怕是我們由這遠方來的人，當局認爲我們是爲了作事而來，不會把這容易好做的官給我們去做吧？張介夫低頭想了一想，他這話果然有理。不過自已所想做的，乃是小官吏，也决不至於和軍事當局去起正面衝突，却也不必十分灰心，當時也就只好笑了一笑道：那也事在人爲罷了。周有容笑道：那是對的。陜西雖然是苦地方，做縣長發了財回家的，也不少，然而我怎麽就讓人家打了回來呢？像張先生有這番精神，可以不怕挨打，那麽，也許可以作官發財的。張介夫這也就覺得他的話，有些咄咄逼人，不免臉上一紅。周有容也省悟着是自已說錯了，趕快的把話來扯開，因向志前道：志前兄說是要介紹女人去傭工，不知道是怎樣的女人？志前道：周縣長需要女僕嗎？有容連連搖手道：不，不，我有個朋友，太太新由東方到西安來，而且還帶了兩個小孩子，商事都感到不便，非用女撲不可。而且除了需要一個作雜事的而外，還需要一個引孩子的。（一二五）</p>
<h3>裸國所見</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>丨初民生活寫眞斷片丨</p>
<p>最近有一位朋友從南洋羣島來信，在他的漫遊浪跡中，到了一個離澳洲不遠的不甚著名的珊瑚羣島，在那裏，他看到了斷髮文身的蠻族，巢居裸體的原始人民。</p>
<p>那邊的人，無讑老幼男女，除下體用蕉葉或樹皮所織的布來遮掩外，其餘各部分，是常年赤裸著，浴於大自然界的陽光之内·那少女們天乳高聳，愈大愈美·</p>
<p>因爲不事衣飾的緣故，於是男女皆以文身爲美。兒童從小便把前額和鼻部刺花·至十一二歲時，女子開始繫裙。這裙不過是遮掩私處的一條蕉葉布而已·那時便從腰部到膝蓋，前胃後臀，統統加刺魚紋的花樣。及至出嫁後首次分娩期近，更把乳房，胸背，兩臂，以至下頷，全部刺花，不留空𨻶。在被刺的辰光，破皮留血，痛苦不甚·可是爲要滿足伊們審美的外觀，便不恤以苦肉爲代價。</p>
<p>說到他們的婚姻制度，他們從不提倡一夫一婦白首偕老的禮制，他們從不希罕烈女貞婦。雖然照例也是從小訂婚，但旣婚以後，不論久暫，隨時可以解脫，他們以魚乾椰子爲行聘禮物，女家以方四尺厚約五英寸的大芋餅爲報。有的在結婚以後，新郎健在無恙，而新婦却舍舊圖新，已經歷事數夫了。</p>
<p>富有的少女們，雖然還不懂得用巴黎脂粉，伊們用薑根所製的貴重的橙黃顏料敷面，條紋斑斑，再塗以椰油·用鯊魚齒所製的環作項圈，用珍珠及⿔甲做耳璫。</p>
<p>不但耳朶要裝飾，連鼻孔的兩緣和中膜，都穿著孔·用珍異的鳥羽挿在鼻孔的兩緣，珠貝懸在鼻下。</p>
<p>他們大都靠著漁獵生活。刳木的木皮艇是他們的漁船·棕葉網，椰幹矛是他們的工具，一片茫茫是他們的宇宙。</p>
<p>這些島是純粹的海洋中的珊瑚礁，因爲土性關係，雖在熱帶，而生長的植物種類很少。一望葱葱，盡是椰子樹。他們的衣食住的原料，除了海產以外，差不多全靠椰子。</p>
<p>雖然這不過是孤懸海洋中的星星小島，雖然那裏還是生活着草昧未開的狉狉初民，可是它也是不列顚帝國屬領的一個鏈圈兒了。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （啓淵）</p>
<p>一個人在大衆中撒過一次謊，彷彿一張白紙上沾染了一點墨汁，要洗滌去的確很難了。</p>
<p>墨斷了，我們有時把濃厚的墨汁爲媒介，把它成全；但是兩端的交端間，就此生了一層隔膜。朋友間的感情也是這般。</p>
<h3>漁光曲與鳳陽歌</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>「漁光曲」是海上漁民們痛苦生活的哀號聲。雖然音調是那麽的柔和，唱起來是那麽的悅耳，但是我們苦是細細地一讀「漁光曲」的語句，天哪，竟然是一字一淚。</p>
<p>繼「漁光曲」而興的，是「鳳陽歌」。「鳳陽歌」的調子，自然是比了「漁光曲」更好，唱起來，比了「漁光曲」更好聽，但是我們若是細細地一讀「鳳陽歌」的語句，天哪，簡直的可說是一語一血。丨丨「鳳陽歌」是描繪農村破產聲中，農民賣兒鬻女，奔走流離之苦的。</p>
<p>在遊藝會裏，聽着像天仙般的明星唱「漁光曲」，唱「鳳陽歌」，是只覺得賞心悅耳，挺有趣的。坐在沙發裏，聽着收音機或留聲機裏唱着「漁光曲」或「是鳳陽歌」，再喝着高貴的飲料，及着高貴的香烟，心裏自然是满舒服的。但是我們匲　是閉了眼睛忖一忖，櫛風沐雨，終歲在驚濤駭浪的海上討生活，而猶不够還租的漁民的生活，究竟是怎麽樣？十年九荒，有田地的賣田地，有兒郎的賣兒郎，沒兒郎的出來東飄西盪，這種生活，又是怎麽樣？</p>
<p>「漁光曲」和「鳳陽歌」，雖然是不住的在一般公子哥兒，奶奶小姐們的口中歌唱着，作爲是消閒解悶的妙品，但不知聰明透頂的公子哥兒，奶奶小姐們，是否體會得所哼的歌曲中，究竟說是些兒甚麽東西？</p>
<p>我們的漁民，是給外國的漁業，逼得喘不過氣來了。我們的農民，是到處的閙着十年九荒。但是天堂中的公子哥兒，奶奶小姐們，却不住的唱着「漁光曲」，「鳳陽歌」，正在樂呢！</p>
<h3>岳堤</h3>
<p>— （路爾鈺）</p>
<p>蘇堤比不上岳堤，岳堤沒有蘇堤的裝點修飾，然而岳堤儘有自然的雄偉，蘇堤是一輩子及不到！</p>
<p>你走出宜興南門三里，接着就有一條漫肯的石堤橫在面前。石堤上有幾百個矮矮的石柱分立左右，這就是岳飛追殺金兵因而鋪築的岳堤。矮矮的石柱，是拴繫戰馬所用。每當夕陽西下，遠遠望去，活似一大行列的民族英雄，映照河底的夕陽，無異是壯士的熱血！。</p>
<p>— 隱涓</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第二天，這一重憂鬰的空氣顯然是格外的濃厚了，因爲這一日就是老佛爺的愛子丨丨同治丨丨的生忌；而他一生所有的紀念品，又恰好都在奉天，所以這一個忌辰的印象，便分外比往年來行深了！可是宮是内却照例並不舉行什麽儀式。原來這中間也有一層特殊的理由：因爲太后是此刻的一宮的領袖，在伊老人家不曾遐升之前，同治雖是一個在先的領袖，却依舊還是小輩，不能算他是祖先；而依宮中的法例，除掉祖先以外，一切已死的人，都不能單獨的享受祭奠的。</p>
<p>於是每次逢到同治的生辰或駕崩的日子，所用以紀念他的，只是合宮的一切人，一齊靜默起來，並停止娛樂，以示哀悼。這一天，大家當然又得照例的做上十幾個鐘點的啞吧。太后自已也整日的靜坐着，非萬不得已絕不開口；伊的足跡簡直從不曾走出那便殿；臉上是滿堆着一派陰沉愁苦的顏色，使我們見了，都覺得非常的担心，惟恐伊在這種懊惱煩悶情狀之下，再遇到什麽不如意的事情，那可眞敎我們不能過日子了！我這一天的地位是格外的危險，因爲不巧得很，正凑着輪到我服侍太后的日子；起初我眞有此担心，幸而我的運氣還不壞，始終沒有發生過什麽事情。伊只是把關於同治的許多很瑣屑的事情，隨便和我講講。（二三五）</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>上海醫院的開展（中）</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>那時候，英美租界中還有一所醫院名「體仁醫院」，到一八八二年因經費不敷，就在同年八月十四日併進了同仁醫院。</p>
<p>一八八七年一月，吳虹玉又說服了高易洋行華經理李秋坪，使他把預備修建靜安寺的欵子五千元捐入了醫院不算，再從親友那兒代募得同樣的數目，同仁醫院得因此以改造適用的房屋，規模乃益擴。</p>
<p>一九○三年，同仁醫院的婦女部獨立出來設於愛文義路，名爲廣仁醫院。</p>
<p>（註）這一說是根據達文德牧師所著的上海手册，但是我們以爲所謂「麥」者，應該是指麥都思而非莫禮遜：麥都思Ｄr．Ｗ．ＨＭedhurst是和𨿅頡同時到上海來的倫敦會敎士，上海人當然更知道他較於莫禮遜，何况不必再把「麥」字的音曲解？錄此志疑。</p>
<p>隨後，我們舉出外人公立的鹥院，著名的是公濟醫院ＧeneralＨospital和寳隆醫院paulunＨospital公濟醫院在蘇州河邊，頗易自公園橋丨就是外擺渡橋丨上北向望見之。創始於一八六四年，至一九二○年重建。它的組織是「由一永入的按照職任選舉的董事會丨包括三位總領事，四個公共租界的納稅人，二個法租界的納稅人丨執行之。」該院看護之職，向由女修道士ＳistesofＣhsrityＳt．ＶincentdeＰsyl擔任，歷五十年不改；至一九一二年，因法國敎會發生困難及敎會中的主事者以看護有礙淸修兩個原故，始全體去職。</p>
<p>一八九九年，新閘一帶闢爲國際公共租界，由舊英美租界工部局接收合併管理。領袖領事丨德國總領事値年丨克納貝ＫnavＦe因是外人烟稠密，貧病堪憐，就倡議建醫院一所，定名爲「同濟」，使它和舊英租界的仁濟醫院，舊美租界的同仁醫院，屼然鼎峙。因爲他是德國人，所以主張要辦的是一所德國式的鹥院，於是請了當時東方著名的德籍醫學家寳隆Ｄr．Ｐsulun來主持該院，而經費方面又得了德内閣總理亞爾查夫Ａlthoff不少的助力。該院於一九○二年五月開幕。到一九○九年，寳隆博士逝世，於是同濟醫院就改用了他的名字來追念他。</p>
<p>公共租界工部局爲了市政方面特殊的需要，也設了幾個醫院，歸衛生處管理，就是：</p>
<p>隔離醫院　　一九○四年設</p>
<p>神經病醫院　一九○七年設</p>
<p>華捕醫院　　一九○七年設</p>
<p>印捕醫院　　一九○八年設</p>
<p>監獄醫院　　一九○三年設</p>
<p>從一八四三年到一九○三年丨上海開埠之年到日俄戰爭前一年丨這整整的六十年代，上海的醫院事業幾乎完全是由外人包辦的，中國人偶有學習新醫術的也不過在外人醫院中服務就是了；一九○四年春，日俄戰爭爆發，波及我國東北，上海人士沈仲禮王培元等發起萬國紅十字會，前往戰地拯救，戰禍旣枚，乃改名中國紅十字會，在上海陸續開辦醫院三所，日常爲社會服務：</p>
<p>㈠總醫院　　海格路　一九一○年設</p>
<p>㈡北市醫院　新閘路　一九一三年設</p>
<p>㈢南市醫院　外馬路　一九一三年設</p>
<p>一九三二年八月起改名，照上列次序稱爲　「第一」「第三」「第三」醫院。</p>
<p>這是中國人自辦醫院的起始。接着還有兩所以曆來功績而著稱的公立鹥院：</p>
<p>公立上海醫院　一九○九年邑故紳李鍾玨借用　積倉公地募捐營建。</p>

<p>黑龍江省嫩江縣之敎育、自九一八事變後、即現停頓狀態、復加以暴日摧殘、可謂毫無敎育可言、其後再由日方另起爐灶、以奴化敎育代之、一般莘莘學子、即飽受其奴化敎育、而至淡薄我華北靑年之國家觀念、暴日施行此種毒辣政策、本已毫無人道、乃不圖最近該縣僞崔縣長、於本年一月一日到任、該漢奸無恥已極、居然以媚日爲升官發財之工具、將全縣各學校敎員、於此寒假期間、須在敎員講習所訓練一個月、最主要課程、（一）學習日語、（二）研究經學、該爲縣長并表示、日語爲日「滿」提携之利品、經學爲王道之本源、如此提倡麻醉自已民族之謬論、該漢奸可謂心肝全無矣、</p>

<p>申園球塲過大、有疲於奔命之勢、輔仁行動甚速、惜有時操之過急、失去機會、前鋒李允中及劉學琦、有作有爲、可稱傑出人才、後衛趒麟防禦嚴密、不可不得、全隊工作緊凑、但最後五分鐘間、失去籃下機會多次、而致敗北、甚爲可惜、更以人矮吃虧、麥令長腿樂克、猖獗行事、獨行三十分之多、麥令之勝、全仗此公、</p>
<h3>聲勢汹汹</h3>
<p>開始接觸後、輔仁李允中首先中的、旋成三比三、而五比五、相持不久、劉學琦籃下再中、以七比五導前、麥令如狼似虎、聲勢汹汹、樂克比利士二人連中五分、十比七反佔上風、同時輔仁後衛廉澄卽於斯時四次犯規罰出、代以李允武、旣而樂克强生又加三分、以十三比七佔優</p>
<h3>輔仁奮發</h3>
<p>輔仁求勝心切、不甘落後、奮發有爲、氣象一新、劉學琦趙麟追上三分、麥令樂克又造成十五比十後、劉又加三分、李允武兩次罰球連中、及成十五比十五之平乎、全塲空氣緊張、喊聲震耳、李允中復於此時造成十七比十五之勝績、歡聲未已、麥令强生投桃報李、即成十七和局、李允中再中鵠的、十九比十七、又領前茅、樂克兩罰中的、再成均勢、霎時間、樂克再添兩球、上半時麥令乃以二十三比十九勝、</p>
<h3>疲於奔命</h3>
<p>再戰聲起、樂克鷄羣鶴立、得佔便宜、一再建功、輔仁後衛、戒備爲難、吳必顯李允中　亦有建樹、無如得不償失、一度成三十三比二十四、相差有九分之多、此爲全局比數最大之處、而輔仁此時誠有應付爲難之槪、陣容慌亂、李允武短小吃虧、趙麟顧此失彼、接應不暇、</p>
<h3>慌張失機</h3>
<p>輔仁極力振作、徐圖宏展、劉學琦吳必顯連增二球之後、聲勢忽然大盛、再接再厲、精神益旺、劉學琦近投遠射、分數迭增、追至三十二比三十四、僅差二分、大有後來居上之勢、麥令陣綫不整、樂克被禁甚嚴、無所作爲、三十六比三十八後、輔仁忽以求勝心切、籃下失機、慌張不堪、而後方偶一不愼、樂克又施虎威、分數扶搖直上、成四十四比三十七輔仁敗績、</p>
<h3>出戰西靑</h3>
<p>今晚爲輔仁在滬之最後一戰、對手爲西靑、籃球冠軍西靑隊、該隊自本季出師以來、從未敗北、輔仁對之、恐兇多吉少、但如能謹愼從事、鎭靜作戰、則出奇制勝、亦意中事也、晚八時半仍在申園交鋒、裁判員張國勛舒鴻一昨晚成績如下、</p>

<h3>論和尙並沒有跑掉</h3>
<p>— 再靑</p>
<p>新文學運動初期最活躍的人物之一，劉半農，他已經在一九三四年故去了。他留下了不少的著作，特殊是死後出版的一册「半農雜文」，更是中國新文學運動史裏的重要文獻。這部書的前面，他寫了一篇很長的自序，說明了自已對於寫作的態度，經過，以及輯集的動機。結束的地方，他本着那一慣的恢諧的態度，寫下一則民間流行的故事。</p>
<p>說是有一個公差，被派押解一個和尙。他所帶的是公文一角、衣包一個，雨傘一把，和尙頭上的一面枷。一路上，這公差惟恐所帶的東西有失落，總是喃喃的念着：「和尙，公文，衣包，雨傘，枷。」一個夜裏，和尙乘公差熟睡，把公差的頭剃了，把自已的枷枷到公差頸項上，偷偷的逃了。公差醒來，摸摸自已的頭，點點東西，和尙也在，公文也在，衣包也在，雨傘也在，祇是自已不在，「不知道我到那裏去了。」</p>
<p>說完了這個故事，他又在下面寫道：「所謂抓住時代精神，所謂站到時代前面，這種的美談，我也何嘗不羡慕，何嘗不想望呢？無如我不願抓住了和尙，丢掉了我自已。」意思是很明白的，就是站在時代前面的文學，抓住時代精神的文學，在實質上是沒有了「我」的存在。抓住了時代丢掉了我，還有如跑掉了和尙抓住了公差一樣，他不願意這樣做。</p>
<p>「和尙果眞是跑掉了麽？」當我讀到這個地方，如此的想。寫本文之前，我讀了「新中華」上張夢麟的結算一九三四年中國文學的文章。論小品文的部分，他的結論是，小品文祇是個人的主觀的文學。誠然是如此，遺憾是他並沒有知道，在一九三四年的小品文中，也有反個人反主觀的一傾向。劉半農知道了「公差」之外還有「和尙」，較之張夢麟，可謂已高一籌了。但他終竟是看花了眼，如果他沒有死，肯擦擦眼睛，他定可以看到，「公差」固在，「和尙」也並沒有跑掉，造成這樣環境者，是他自已的昏花的眼。</p>
<p>他如此想，也許還有更多的别人也如此想，反個人主義反主觀主義的文學，是根本沒有「個人」，是喪了「一已」的存在的。其實是不然。據說有這麽一回事，一個臨時演員參加拍攝了一個羣衆塲面的戲。等到片子放映了，他得意的跑到戲院裏看。果然他所參加拍攝的羣衆塲面也現了，一個畫面上有那麽多數不淸的人。然而他悲哀，他看不到自已的存在，他懊惱他自已的犧牲，他幾乎哭了出來。但一刹眼畫面淡入了，是羣衆中的一部分，他看到了自已的全身了，「原來是有我」，他有一些高興。因爲他在主角身邊，畫面再淡入，他覺得自已太淸晰了，他望着主角的大頭：「原來那麽多的江</p>
<p>人裏面還有他。」他不再悲哀了。說「公差與和尙」故事的他，生前所看到的，實質上祇是這電影上的第一個畫面耳。</p>
<p>我此地所說，也許並不能盡他的原意。他所說的「和尙」，或許是指我所說的「思想主張上的一致性，」這一致性是「别人的」而不是「自已的。」回到他在文學上的黃金時代吧。他寫過「覆王敬軒先生的信」了，他反對舊文學的遺孽，他主張白話文。但白話文學的提倡，並不始於劉半農。那麽，他在新文學運動初期，不竟也是一個「抓住了和尙，丢掉了自已」的人麽？我們不能如此說，這其間依舊是有他自已存在的，這存在着的他自已，還是非常淸晣，他自已大槪也會承認。</p>
<p>現在和五四時期已自不同，反映在文學上的「自已」他就變了樣。這變了樣，使他有「何嘗不想」之歎。所變的是什麽呢？就是當時的「自已，」祇是溶化於少數人的生活之中，「自已」的生活祇與少數人有一致性，因而「自已」的存在便持别的顯明。現在，時代進展了，抓住時代精神的人，是擴大了「自已」，把「自已」的生活溶化於多數人的生活之中，在劉半農一班人看起來，「自已」是糢糊了，甚至於汩沒了，其實，所抓住的是「和尙」，也是「自已」。</p>
<p>可以再加說明。現在的「自已」，是如前面所說的第一個畫面，自已是存在的，因爲和大家溶化了，便不易看出。過去的自已，如第二以致於第三幅獨立的畫面，溶化的祇是少數人，一看便淸晰了。如奇裝怪服的人走於人衆之中，容易辨認，穿普通衣服的人，則不易尋找，理由是一樣的。問題是，「自已」究竟願意溶化於少數人之中，還是多數人之中，當心「和尚」跑掉。</p>
<h3>自慰</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>過去的生活，像汚泥，也像死水，然而我偏愛重溫那些汚泥與死水似的生活，在今天，今天的回憶裏，一顆心一半在痛，一半也輕微的感到慰安。近幾年以來，我的生活太複雜了，有血，有恐怖，有眼淚，然而也有笑。不知有多少次的夢裏，夢着過去那些可怕的遭遇，使我狂呌，使我怕，直到自已驚醒的時候，才明白原來是一個惡夢！</p>
<p>不過，在汚泥中，我的心仍能開着潔白的花，這一點我是能够自慰的。</p>
<p>朋友，你想，在貧窮與飢餓雙重壓榨下，人怎麽不會瘦？人怎麽不會老呵！一枝一枝地敵人的暗箭向着我心窩裏射，我受傷了，人稍爲弱一點就會死的，倖好我還堅强的活着。過去，有幾交夜裏，我眞想悄悄地離開這世界，然而，這只是「想」而已，事實上我依然活在這世界上。這世界是惡濁的，汚穢的，可是，多少的人們躱在惡濁堆裏得意的在笑着，在唱着，感到幸福！我眞不解，人與人的心相差得這麽遠。</p>
<p>去年這個時候，我的心是被千條蛇萬條蛇在咬着，使我喊都喊不出聲，哭也沒有眼淚！今年，這個時候，在外表上看來是比較好了一點，然而，還不是忍着隱痛過日子。</p>
<p>昨夜楨來玩，他也像我一樣遭遇過許多可怕事件的人，他面上永遠是愁苦的，幽鬰的，雖然我心頭也有他那份愁苦與幽鬰，但我還是故意編織着一大堆甜的話來安慰他，吿訴他莫灰心，而他不愛聽，因爲他比我更了解這世界。我有時似乎覺得，一個人無智無識來得好。智識，智識在一些人腦海裏會成了毒質，所以有些人是甘願埋葬在自已所掘的墳墓裏的，你說他走錯了路嗎，不，實際上他才說你走錯了路兒，這將奈何？</p>
<p>大海，水漠，農林，都市，戰塲，地獄，······我都走遍了，使我習慣了各種各樣的苦難，黑夜的暴風雨，地獄裏的黑暗，生活的鐵鞭子，毒利的暗箭，我都嚐過，所以將後或許更有苦難的擔子加在我肩上，我也不怕，因爲我都習慣了。</p>
<p>我看見很多人都在生活的鐵鞭子下馴伏了，而我仍願意在惡劣的環境中掙扎，雖然苦，也覺行很値得，因爲這是我自已甘願的。世間有什麽比自由更可貴的東西嗎？沒有的！所以過去的生活雖像汚泥，像死水，而我的心在汚泥中開着潔白的花，這一點是値得自慰的！</p>
<h3>獵人（下）</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>平常到古爾班挿汗嶺覺得一歇兒工夫就到了，今兒好像越走越遠是的，走了這老半天，還瞧不見古爾班挿汗嶺的影兒，是怎麽𦉆？那一定是馬跑得�</p>
<p>慢了！托果那賴哈憤怒了！伸手住腰帶上摸鞭子，摸了空，走得太急促了忘記帶鞭子，心上又有一點點懊悔。這下子更激怒了！扭着身子狠命的用拳頭打馬屁股：</p>
<p>丨媽的！你也誠心跟我搗蛋！</p>
<p>馬撒開四蹄，有如騰空似的迅速奔馳，牠那純白無雜的短毛，淌着熱汗，嘴里吐着熱氣，嘘嘘帶喘的運用着牠所有的氣力。</p>
<p>碰！</p>
<p>徙然一聲槍響，托果那賴哈的目力隨着這聲音追踪着。遠遠的從北邊博羅古林過來一帮人，完全騎着馬。托果那賴哈停住馬仔細的瞧了瞧，都帶着傢伙，像一羣匪賊，向着自已這邊跑來，托果那賴哈覺得不妙，眞要是匪賊來了逮住自已哪有活命。</p>
<p>丨三十六着走爲上策！丨心里打定主意，撒馬便跑，後邊的槍聲接着響開了。</p>
<p>噗哧一下，馬失前蹄躺下了。這比一顆子彈打進托果寻賴哈的胸膛還危險！托果那賴哈下馬站住，面朝着對方跑過來的人馬，伸開兩臂，失了知覺似的停着，聽候着命運的宣判。</p>
<p>寒冷從雪地上噴着，侵凌着阿拉莫里特平原，托果那賴哈身上每個細胞都被寒冷玩弄着。純白的馬躺在雪上幾乎認不出那是馬那是雪，馬的喘聲攪着托果寻賴哈的低微的呼吸，太陽準眼盯着托果那賴哈的鎖着的眉。</p>
<p>托果那賴哈低垂着頭，朦朧着眼給寒冷塑在雪地上似的。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>當托果那賴哈抬頭看時，恐懼馬上在他心上粉碎而消失了！原來這些人都是巴音王的勦匪軍。</p>
<p>不等他開口，就有人把他逮住：</p>
<p>丨看你再往哪兒逃！</p>
<p>托果那賴哈臉上的氣色立刻被恐怖抓去了瞪大了眼睛：</p>
<p>丨你們不要認錯了人，我是卡木留托的獵人！</p>
<p>另外一個有鬍子的，靠近托果那賴哈身前，喝道：</p>
<p>丨混蛋！偷了賴音喇嘛的牲口不認賬！今天看你招不招，不用别的，你騎的這匹馬就是賴音喇嘛的！</p>
<p>托果那賴哈仰臉望望天，滴着淚，甚麽也不說，明知分辨也是白費口舌。</p>
<p>三四個年靑小伙子把托果那賴哈背綁着，兩個持馬刀的人拖着他走。</p>
<p>天是啨光的，地是雪白的，馬是純白無雜的，惟有人類是汚濁的。馬刀，紫衣，黃馬褂，各色的馬，托果那賴哈的一顆心！</p>
<p>茫茫無涯際的平原，白晶晶地雪蓋遍所有的塵汚。馬蹄在雪地上留着痕跡，寒冷在人們臉上打了烙印。在這空曠的平原上，沉寂趕走了風，趕走了一切的聲音。此刻惟有馬蹄和呼喘，馬刀和餐刀突皮了沉寂的防綫，用騷亂去抵抗寒冷。</p>
<p>勝利在每個軍人的臉上浮現，醬紫色的面部泛着喀爾喀人的偉大！托果那賴哈完全不是一個獵手了，他簡直是辱蔑了獵手！怎的會失掉了反抗性，一點喀爾喀族的氣槪沒有！</p>
<p>雪地馬蹄下消滅了，人們下了馬，擁着托果那賴哈去見賴音喇嘛。</p>
<p>可是早就派好人在那里傳話：</p>
<p>丨活沸吩咐，捉住馬賊不必來見便可治死。</p>
<p>托果那賴哈連眼淚也擠不出了，别人已經宣吿了他的罪狀，接着就要執行死刑。</p>
<p>丨活佛帶我到天堂去吧！</p>
<p>托果那賴哈雙𩓐羅藍兒直苗苗跪着禱吿，閉上眼睛等候着最後的結局。</p>
<p>忽然起了暴風，地上的雪刮了起來，颯颯的響，蒙古包上的積雪，被風掠到地上，馬嘶呌着，喀爾喀人的血沸騰着，在一陣喊聲里托果那賴哈的血濺了雪地。</p>
<p>賴音喇嘛跪在佛前祈禱着：</p>
<p>丨我佛保佑托果那賴哈升天堂吧，他的罪已贖了。</p>
<p>風吼着，雪飛着，蒙古平原浸在寒冷中。（完）</p>
<h3>吃飯（二）</h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>「喂，你說說，這飯究竟怎麽總是奥的？」</p>
<p>我看見他涎嘴涎臉地盯着我的香烟，確乎使我吃驚不小。我一面防着，一面隨口道：</p>
<p>「誰曉得，肚子餓，吃了就是，問甚麽！」</p>
<p>「不，我是說，這飯是從······」</p>
<p>我看他話還沒有說完，又挨進我一步，那種餓癆樣子，使我不得不更加防備，把烟頭就向手心窩裏用指頭夾着，漫應他道：</p>
<p>「管它······」</p>
<p>「你看！」他無可奈何地，伸着一個指頭指着杠架上的一個翻着風車的同學。「哈，再來一個！」他簡直向着他喊起來了。馬上，圍着杠架周圍，張着嘴巴看的同學都也笑着附和一聲：</p>
<p>「好，再來一個！」</p>
<p>那鐵杠上的一臉粗肉的同學，閃着一雙灼灼的眼睛，我看他其實也很餓了。然而他在衆人的喝采聲中，一股英雄氣斗然綴上他的眉稍，脹紅着臉，鼓着巿靑筋，就「嚇」的一聲，我担心他把吃奶的氣力都倒出來。可是他却已經兩脚向着天空，光頭向着地下，一霎眼間，他已在圓圓的鐵杠圍翻了一個圓圓的觔斗了。大家似乎看得起勁，有些倒又似乎覺得這餓着肚皮的傻子索性連奶氣都給他翻出來吧，於是也就口滑地喊下去：</p>
<p>「好，再來一個！」</p>
<p>接着又是一個圓圓的觔斗。等到第三次「再來一個」時，我的手心窩裏的烟頭突然離開了我的手指，轉過身來，就看見旁邊的那同學已經把烟頭塞在嘴巴跳進人叢中去了。</p>
<h3>談詩歌與感情</h3>
<p>— 流冰</p>
<p>有些詩人曾這樣說過：「把你們的感情合盤托出地表現出來；那兒就有詩」。這話，我們雖然不能完全同意，但是，「藝術丨丨詩歌是用具體的形象來表現思想和感情的東西」，尤其是表現着最高感情的詩歌，牠與感情的不可分離的連繫，是非常明顯的。</p>
<p>近來，很有些詩人曾經寫過這樣的詩，丨丨沒有感情的詩。我們都知道，藝術是人與人之間的精神底結合的手段之一，藝術作品表現的感情愈高，就愈能引起精神上結合的可能性。反之，所給與的藝術是不能使作者的精神傳達與讀者，這作品便失了其價値。一篇詩沒有了感情，卽便是沒有骨髓的骷髅，新聞的排句。</p>
<p>可是，我們又要注意到，我們生活着的社會裏，看到的東西，聽到的東西，各種各樣的事實，都能激動我們的感情，是不是這些任何感情都有表現在詩中的價値呢？我們肯這地說，不是！</p>
<p>關於這點，拉斯金曾說過：「少女能關於失掉了的愛情而歌詠，但是守財奴不能關於失掉了的錢而歌詠」。又說：「關於把你緊緊抓着的感情，這種感情被詩人歌詠，積極地在眞的意義上，自問能否使他感動？若是能，這感情便是好的，倘若不是不能被歌詠，便是祇有可笑的那方面給與感動，那感情是低的」。</p>
<p>這裏，很明顯地吿訴了我們關於不是任何感情都有表現於詩中的價値之理由。如守財奴的失掉金錢，也有他自已内在的感情流動，爲什麽不能歌詠呢？很明白地，是因爲牠對於他人之間的結合是沒有用處的。</p>
<p>我們怎樣去斷定値得我們表現的感情呢？這不僅是靠詩人的激動的燃燒程度而决定，牠是决定於現實社會的需要。在「五四」之後不久，羅曼諦克地的歌詠愛情的感情爲人們愛好着，但是，到了「五卅」以後，牠便爲愛好的人所輕視了。那時，狂暴的，熱烈的，呌喊的感情又爲人們所歌詠。</p>
<p>同時，這裏是包括着關於詩人的藝術觀丨丨世界觀，例如有閒詩人的關於歌詠失戀之類的感情，必然地爲勞苦大衆所唾駡，相反地，歌詠積極的感情，必然爲有閒者所輕視。</p>
<p>最後，用森山啟的話，作爲本文的結束：</p>
<p>「第一，有在詩中被表現價値的東西，總是一定的社會的需要。所有詩人，都把那需要，基凖於詩人的世界觀和感情的坩堝，而表現在詩中。第二，因此，詩人的感情的坩堝，愈能爲實現社會底歷史的地進步的任務而沸騰，那感情就愈便被表現在詩中的價値增高」。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>美國大學校長的言論</h3>
<p>— 頑</p>
<p>二十五日美國好斯敦電，文華大學校長韋卓明博士，今日在此宣稱日本侵略行爲，中國不能長此任人宰割，應唯力是視以謀抵抗云云，</p>
<p>我不知該校長宣傳此種言論，其用意究屬何在，是否僅欲鼓勵我國抵抗日本之意？果眞如此，則該校長的話，未免過於滑稽了，日本之侵略我國，不僅中日兩國的事，原是關係世界各國的事，不過程度上有比較嚴重和經薄的分别罷了，我人受日本直接的宰割，損失之重，固不待言，而他國難道對於此事，絕不發生任何關係？而該校長云「我國（謂美國）固可接受日人之政策，以求和平，但中國應惟力是視，以抵抗之云」，如此看中日問題，爲遠東局部問題，與世界各國，絕不發生關係，「各人自掃門前雪，不管他家瓦上霜」，如此素抱門羅主義的美國，與該校長主張，似屬相合，</p>
<p>但該校長又謂，「日本之侵略中國，顯爲驅逐白色人種離亞洲之初步」，如是則該校長旣認日人蠶食中國，不僅是遠東局部問題，而有世界性的存在，面該校長又云，美國之海軍，不是保護斐律濱及夏威夷，日本攻取二地，易如反掌，如此表示美國無法帮忙，可以置身事外，他國應出而干涉之意，已露言外。</p>
<p>該校長又云，「日人最近野心，在覓取推銷日貨之市塲，中國贊成門户開放，日本則贊成亞洲門羅主義」，主張門户開放，我國爲多國的市塲，主張門羅主義，我國爲日本一國之市塲，我國爲他人的市塲，固無分乎彼此也，無論此時我國國力，尙不能抵抗日人，原是無可諱言的事實，卽使可能，一方爲我國國家而抵抗，又一方面是爲列强而抵抗，於我國自身的利益原是無幾也。</p>
<p>總之現在世界，眞如古人所云「牽一髮而全身皆動」，歐洲之局面，無殊於遠東，德國之廢棄盟約，不顧一切，拚命硬幹，亦無殊於日本，但法國的國力，比較我國充實很多，但法國無法遏制强鄰的跋扈，其勢非得假英意，及諸小國之力，不足以控制德國的强力，如此則任何一國，欲與强橫的鄰國抵抗，不能不借助於與國、固非單一國所能成事，其例亦可見於此矣，</p>
<h3>哀歌</h3>
<p>— 企吾</p>
<p>似乎我被人發現了才到第三進堂屋裏。</p>
<p>堂屋里的情形不同了，你以爲這裏更凄絕嗎？適適相反呢！像一個大集會一樣，全族的人都到齊了，雖然一列皜素的顏色使人心斗上吊起了一塊石頭似的不舒服；但是這裏是喧閙的丨丨這騷騷然的情形說我　父故世了顯出有些不相合。</p>
<p>我因爲急於見舅母，女僕吿訴我在臥房里，就上樓去了。</p>
<p>舅母和衣睡在床上，睡熟了，這未亡人的悲痛，睡夢中未識會見一切家務都沒有支配妥當的舅父嗎？</p>
<p>再下樓來我才瞧淸楚了那些喧閙着的人頭，從我記憶中外祖父故世時候沒有這般「熱閙，」許多似曾相識的面孔至少增加三分之一在他們這種吵吵閙閙的狀態中，我的突然參加並未引起他們的注意，不過母親和弟弟從一個陰暗的角落裏招呼我。我還不及啟口，母親細聲地用眼睛示意警吿我：</p>
<p>「聽着！」</p>
<p>眞的，我踏進了陌生地步了。一切的人，一切的面孔，一切的舉動，一切的言語，都是像和我隔絕了似的，而母親又是那樣地對我說。於其懷擬莫測，就同期待着啟幕的觀衆般的在角落一個椅裏坐了下來。</p>
<p>言語綜雜的送到我耳官裏，但是你不能分淸誰說的話，除出一個「吵什麽！有話好說！」的粗嗓子丨丨聽了他的說話，就能知道那個人是那樣豪爽的丨丨一如大羣的蒼蠅在腐敗物旁飛逐的樣子：這一點沒有侮辱的意思，你知道他們爭論着的是什麽呢？像腐敗物一樣受蒼蠅羣歡迎的遺產呢！</p>
<p>我明白了這「熱閙」的情形，垂下頭去把自已拉回到第二進大廳裏：舅父獨自兒在中央的容貎是那樣可怕，使人懷疑死後眞有靈魂的嗎？他終生克勤克儉，爲了養病的費用浩大，甚至沒有享受</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>聽聽無綫電的淸福，被「家務」磨拆死了丨丨丨我敢這樣斷定。</p>
<p>我早說過這所大厦是靠着舅父這支貧弱的樑木維持着整個重量的。平時一點點瑣碎的事情，是沒有一個人肯挻出身來說一句話的，而這一句話就能决定這「事情」的是否。作爲舅父並不是太辛勞家務而患大病，但是什麽東西拉回他想聽聽無綫電的時候回鄕的呢？他是這大厦的主人，他不能太浪費祖上的遺產，他要做一個好榜樣給人看的，我們不問養病是否浪費祖產，這還不是最大的理由，他是不顧自已貧弱的力量想支持這大厦永久存在，他不能坐視着一點點事情都沒有人挺身出來的這個大族！</p>
<p>但是這大厦終究是塌毁了，出於意料外的有這末許多超「熱閙」的人來誰持大局，爲了舅父沒有生得一個兒子！</p>
<p>我瑞探起頭來巡視那些似曾相識的面孔，我想哭，但是沒有眼淚！（完）</p>
<h3>懷戀與恐怖</h3>
<p>— 雪虹</p>
<p>時光已毫不珍惜地給我帶走了二十一個年頭。我曾經在這些過去了的歷程裏浮游一通，就彷彿我坐在火車裏於短促的時間内經過一段遙遠的路。睜着眼，看道畔的那些葱蘢的樹枝，以及遠處那偌大的充滿綠意的絢爛沃饒的田疇，心靈上時時飄着淺笑！臉龐上也永是展着怡悅的顏色。在過去的歷程裏，我又彷佛乘着飛機翶翔於無邊的空際，雖只一刹那，我確然感到雲遊的暢快：輕漂的閃爍的綺麗的雲霞，漾進機窗，使我迷惑沉醉；在碧藍的淸澈的穹蒼，和茫然的遐隔的塵寰中，我仰瞻俯瞰，覺得已到了「忘我」「我無」的境地！人世之於自已，好像絲毫沒有關係。</p>
<p>假如是可能的話，我將喊令司機人把火車的引擎煞住；或者我要禁止那駕駛飛機的機假停止飛行。因爲在這時候，我已將所有的景緻收於眼底，而且歎爲觀止，眞不願再前進，以傷害健好的目力！</p>
<p>假如是可能的話，我也願望火車或飛機趕快向後回行，把我過去的路程重新溫覽一遍。因爲我知道我的前進並沒有預定了什麽目標，我最初的懷抱只是遊戲，只是嘗試！現在這遊戲，這嘗試我都已够了，過去的我儘可以回味，儘可以享受了！何况前邊是那麽地捉摸不定：也許火車會經過一片不毛的沙漠，鑽進一道深邃的地洞！或遇到不意的阻礙而出軌！也許飛機會碰到一陣狂暴的罡風而傾覆，逢着一次迷濛的濃霧而失了方向，或忽然機油乾竭而墜落！</p>
<p>可是，事實上，忍心的無情的「時光」，它偏偏固拗地執住我前進，它不讓我後退，它抓得我這樣緊緊！我幾番依依地回首，然而越看看越遠遠了！於是我閤上了眼皮，細細地默默地思量丨丨一批一批散漫的記憶，朦朧地成羣地擠滿了心頭。老是這般貪婪地懷戀過往纔得了麽？「不可能的」！它回答我這樣。它更吩咐我凝視着前方，因爲前方還有一個「未來」！</p>
<p>凝視「未來」，這事情太爲難了我！我微弱的視線，穿不過這當前的糢糊的「未來」！我只看見它是白茫茫的一片！深淵，巉巖，蘿蕂，頑石，還有不隄防的可怕的襲擊，我能逾越嗎？我我能抵拒嗎？············</p>
<p>如果我過去所走的是平坦的康莊大道，那麽以後我將走的是崎嶇的羊腸曲徑。我偶然地走了這許多路，想起那是無知的荒唐的撞亂，雖保無恙於今日，已覺得非常寒心！何况一旦發現了前途的不測和危險，怎不魂驚魄悸？</p>
<p>啊啊！未來！未來是恐怖的！縱然有人說未來是光明的！</p>

<h3>憂鬱的紫丁香</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>向着禮拜堂的住屋的後窗，有一座隣居的私家的小小的園子。淸早上，禮拜堂的淸脆的鐘聲蕩漾在薄霧的空氣中，園裏每株花則沐在晶碎的重露裏。我站在窗前，一邊聽着溫柔的音樂奏似的的鐘聲，一邊瞧着每株花都搖曳着惺忪的初醒的媚態，輕盈地搖曳在微微的晨風中。</p>
<p>是有着詩意的幻美和使心境愉適的詩意的早晨呵！</p>
<p>對於這大自然妝綴得那樣華麗的園林，我是能够用着更多的時間和更多的</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>沉醉一樣的心情來鑑賞的。特别呌人不易忘記的景緻是每當黃昏的時候，淡淡的落日的餘暉，淡淡地撫摸着禮拜堂上峙空的塔尖，撫摸着那靜美的小小的園林，像不忍離去似的那麽戀依依。這時的意味更有點近似神妙了。</p>
<p>每天，無論在傍晚，在淸晨，我凖得來到這窗邊逗遛了一些辰光，已經習慣了好多日子了。因爲站在那看那樣的風物，沉悶的心靈往往就會馬上輕鬆下來的。可是我却時常感到一個失望，栽植任何樣花種的這園子，獨少了紫丁香的輕倩的影子，倒奇怪園主人爲什麽單不欲紫丁香，我雖然讚美這園林有各樣各色的花卉，但是我不喜歡太艷的桃花，和太艷的薔薇，那濃濃的香會反而使人感到呼吸迫促的。我喜歡的是不艷亦不淡的紫色的紫丁香，仿彿一個薄裝的雅緻而沉默的姑娘。</p>
<p>然而我所欲的紫丁香却向來沒瞧到。</p>
<p>一天淸早照例又走到後窗前，用着比平常更細意的逡巡滿心想能尋出它，看了幾遍，視綫行到那本來有着葡萄棚的地方時，西叢紫丁香的影子霍然映上我的眼廉了。如果那葡萄架不拆去，紫丁香就那麽一輩子寂寂地開寂寂的愁謝。</p>
<p>紫丁香現在能「够迎着陽光笑着臉吧，可是不，爲了過去長長的日子，被埋沒於葡萄棚下，得不到太陽物養育，露水的滋植。已使它如一個病患者般的沒歡容，滿臉讓深深的憂愁的暗雲籠罩着。無限的惆悵繚繞着小小的枝葉，小小的靈魂？靑春的顏色在黯淡的命運裏邊無名的憔悴了。悽慘的身子沒勁地低垂到地面上。</p>
<p>不由地爲紫丁香的憂鬱而無端憂鬱起來。</p>
<p>眞不禁代紫丁香詛咒那萄葡叢。使它無言地過無陽光無幸福的黑暗的日子，亦使它未曾有過燦爛的靑春而已悄悄地近於凋亡。所有不幸的遭遇全是可惡的葡萄叢贈賜的。沒有葡萄叢，它會得比其他的同伴更怡悅更活潑的出現在這園林裏。</p>
<p>也許會受到主人珍重的欣賞。但是一切都被葡萄叢摧殘盡了。</p>
<p>而我祇能在這窗口上遙遙地凝視你陰沉的而又憔悴的影子，爲你的不幸嘆息着。</p>
<p>誰亦想不到在另一個大淸早，我正踱到窗邊的當兒，忽然有兩個年輕的姑娘在石子路上走着，各採着一把鮮花，拿在手裏，有紅的色，有紫的色。待我把眼睛移向紫丁香的地位去的時候，紫的色紫丁香已歿了憂鬱的影子了。只剩一堆發鬆的泥土。於是我方知道它已放在那個姑娘的手裏。一下有些凄然的樣子。</p>
<p>被年輕的小姑娘帶去也或會得到一回較好的待遇，把它小心地供養到鏤金的淨瓶中，不過明日將不可免的狠快便萎謝的。明日又有新鮮的來代替昨日枯乾的。只是憂鬱的紫丁香，你憂鬱的影子，在我的記憶上却永不凋殘。······</p>
<h3>說書塲</h3>
<p>— 覺</p>
<p>到北平來，日子雖還過不了多少，但說書塲，我是進去過好幾回的了。原因是　的地方是這麽的淸冷，一到夜晚，獨自兀坐在古刹似的房間裏，靜聽着在夜空中震顫着的梆子聲，小販呌賣聲，······就更顯得凄凉岑寂，敎人熬受不住，所以，聽說書，就漸成爲我每於悶煩不過時的唯一工作了。</p>
<p>這地的說書塲，說來是古陋的很的</p>
<p>普通在一間約一二丈見方的廳堂裏，靠壁的一邊，用磚頭堆砌起一個一尺多高，五六尺大小的土台，上面安放着一張桌子，二張椅子，一隻三脚鼓架，台的旁邊，設着一個煮水賣茶的座位，台的下面，緊緊地安排着六七張茶桌，十多張長凳，這樣就算是一個完整的說書塲的全部設備了。如果於未開塲之先，你於不意間走過門口，向裏面探頭一看，或許也會不相信，這樣一個地方，就是個娛樂的塲所的。别說旁的，單就進入稍帶「現代味」的各娛樂塲觀光一回，又再走進這裏來看看，就會覺得時光是被拉回一二百年似的。</p>
<p>在白天，這地方是很冷落的，通常只有一個口齒流利的老頭，兀坐在臺上，無精打彩地說着三國志，水滸傳，·········這類「大書」，聽客也只是寥寥幾個職業剩餘者和孩子而已。但一到夜晚，可就熱閙的多了。這時，登臺說書的，多是年靑女子，同時，說書時還有彈三絃琴和拉胡琴來和着。其所說的書，不是屬於才子佳人這一類，就是武松景陽崗打虎，趙子龍長板披救主······這些英雄故事。聽衆中，有老關店員，有小販苦力，有閿秀老太，······每唱一段故事，大家都屏息着氣息，眼不轉睛地靜聽着，注看着，好像是着了迷似的。故事唱完一段後，就有人從臺上走下來，手拿着一隻小竹筐，一張桌子走過一張桌子，向着聽客們討錢，客人每次拿出一枚或二枚銅元抛入筐裏，都可隨意，是沒有誰個來相强的；但是，收錢的，他是很乖巧的，每收一次錢，如果不符他所預期的數目，他總會像變戲法的一樣，對着客人說出一大篇難苦的話，再來一次，二次，······討至不能再討時才罷休。或者那一位狡猾的客人，將三二枚銅元對凖筐中的錢堆，下勁一抛，發出「沙丨丨」的一聲嚮聲時，跟着他就會張大嗓子，報吿臺上的主管人說：××桌給錢×吊，敎其餘的客人不好意思太慳吝自已的荷包。所以，如果是個老主顧，熟悉他們所弄的這些鬼計，袋中有個十多枚銅元，也就能在這消磨一二個鐘頭了；但，如果是個新顧客，每晚至少就得花一二毛錢才够。</p>
<p>像這樣一個娛樂地方，自然不會引起高尙者們的注眼的；但，牠對一班大衆們的影響的這點，是不可輕忽的。我想，一班口頭上常嚷着「爲大衆」的藝人們，如肯涉足來這裏來看看，或總不致於自討麻煩的吧？</p>
<h3>乞食者</h3>
<p>— 杜格湼夫著儀譯</p>
<p>我在街上走着······一個衰老的乞食者攔住了我。</p>
<p>紅腫的眼含着淚，口唇發着靑色，遍身的襤褸，汚穢的創傷······啊，多麽可怕，貧窮剝蝕了這不幸的生命！</p>
<p>他向我伸出一隻紅腫而汚濁的手······他呻吟着，哀聲求助。</p>
<p>於是我從自自已的口袋裏索摸······沒有錢包，又沒有表，甚至連一塊手帕都沒有······沒有什麽帶在我身邊。</p>
<p>乞食者却期候着······伸着的手戰慄而顫動着。</p>
<p>我是感動，昏亂，牢牢地抓住這支汚濁而顫動的手，說：「朋友不要失望吧；我是什麽都沒有了的，朋友。」</p>
<p>乞食者紅腫的眼凝注着我，微笑現在他發靑的口唇上丨丨他，他也用冰冷的手指緊握了我。</p>
<p>「什麽，朋友，」他輕輕地說，「就這樣，我也得感謝你，這也是一種賑濟呀，朋友。」</p>
<p>我明白了，我從他那裏，也受到賑濟了。</p>
<h3>映畫舞台咖啡店</h3>
<p>— 姜縵郎</p>
<p>敎日語的靑年，是東京人，無父無母無妻室，他讀書是别人帮助的。（在日本，這樣的例子很多，一個資本家或政客至少帮送幾個窮學生的。）現在雖然在專門學校畢了業，但還是沒有找到工作，但玩是要玩的，有一個錢就玩了，吃了。這恐怕是都市靑年的氣息吧。介紹的人首先就把這個脾氣吿訴我們，假若要多學幾句話的時候，就只有利用這個弱點。</p>
<p>第一次，同了他到銀座看了一遞電影。第一個，是描寫窮漢和一小孩在都市掙扎着政活的情形，有點模仿卓别靈所演的苦笑不得的滑稽劇（卽水上情死。）卽是一個靑年爲了愛情及生活的苦悶和藝妓情死的事。日本的國民性，勇義，熱情，扁狹。一種一往直前，至死不悟的精神，於此可見。</p>
<p>關於東京的舞踏，我們在新宿第一劇塲，看了松竹少女歌劇的「是夜的拜情詩，」「玫瑰」，「巴黎」。五光十色，金迷紙醉，耀人耳目已極，單以舞女，就有一二百。以數量之多，顏色的華雨，肉感的豐艷，刺激觀衆而已，其餘無所取。所可取者。卽是舞台佈置的迅速，這大槪之機器化了吧。因爲那舞台是可以圓轉的。</p>
<p>這裏的舞星，最呌座的是水的江龍子。日本的婦女雜誌上常時登着他的像片，生活狀况及白傳等。尤其婦女高興他。因他扮演男的，扮演得最好。也等於中國人，喜歡梅蘭芳的男扮女裝一樣，這種「性的假裝」，恐怕只有禮敎最甚的東方，才有吧。</p>
<p>咖啡店有兩種，一種是純賣咖啡及食品的。還有一種賣笑的。因爲同來東京的一位先生見享樂主義者，在大版卽進了一個賣笑咖啡店，坐一坐，開一開玩笑，卽是六七元。到東京又同了他去了。日本人之柔媚，賣淫婦之下流，至此已完全看到。站在愛觀的我，覺此並非人間，但絕不天堂。只可說是地獄的水晶化罷了。</p>
<p>但在東京留學的許多人，都有沉迷於此道者，可嘆。</p>

<h3>一九三五年美國汽車業前奏</h3>
<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>丨塡舊量將增三倍丨</p>
<p>汽車製造的原料。包括鋼鐵，銅，鉛，鋅，等等金屬。像美國因爲汽車製造業發達的緣故。每年所消耗的上述各金屬。爲數非常可觀。單拿錫來講。每年用於製造汽車的。要佔常年美國產錫量的百分之二十五。所以一般人都公認。如果美國的汽車業能够復興。那沒其他的實業也將受他之賜了。照現在的情况看起來。汽車業的確已在進行復興之中。不久的將來。我們便可以看到有顯著的進步。生產和銷路方面。都將有大量的增進。就是拿事實來講。那更可以證明這話的不錯。因爲一九三四年的汽車生產量。已經吿訴吾們大有好轉的現象。至於一九三五年呢。那更不用說。將繼續前進。走向光明之路。</p>
<p>依據目前的情形。和已往的經騐來說。能够影響汽車銷路增進的原動。大約有下列三點。（一）是關於塡舊的原因。凡是買了汽車的人。不能呌他一輩子不添用新車。因之隔了幾年的相當時期。便有一批新汽車要去作爲塡舊之用了。（二）因爲各業有景氣。和好轉的關係。我們都知道汽車業和其他實業。大家有互相連繫的循環關係。如果百業衰落。社會濟枯竭經。汽車的銷路自然大受影響。反之。社會表示景氣。大家有購買能力。汽車毫無問題的能不脛而走。廠方收入增加。也不成問題了。（三）聯邦政府撥欵農民的緣故。農民的需要汽車。不亞於都市居衆。他們利用汽用和拖曳機來耕種。增進他們的生產效率。可是農民因爲農村衰落。自然沒有餘錢來買汽車。聯邦政府爲救濟起見。所以撥欵給他們。汽車的銷路自然也能因之上昇哩。　　汽車業外的其他各業。一九三五年是否能繼續不衰地恢復和增進。還在不可知之列。所以上面所講的第二條。對於汽車銷路的影響上增。不很可靠。現在暫且撇開不談。我們單講第一和第三兩項。那是事在必行的。影響於汽車銷路的增加是無疑義的。這兩項的原因。在一九三四年已經很有成效。如克拉姆氏的汽車報吿中稱。一九三四年秋季的美國汽車產量。計共六九六，八五一件。這個數目是一九三零年以來。逐年第三季的產量最鉅數額。冬季因爲種種關係。汽車銷路比較的遲呆。秋季的較勝於每年的第四季也是意中之事。這個數量較之一九三三年同時。增加百分之三，六。</p>
<p>一九三四年開始的九個月中。美國汽車銷數計共二，四九三，二六○件。較之一九三零年同時。走進百分之一八，二。一九三四年冬季的產量當然較低。已經像上面所講的。可是據有力者的估計。是年的總產量約爲二，七七八，○○○件。這總數比了一九三三年增加百分之十二，二。比一九三零年跌百分之二○，五。因爲那年的總產額爲三，五一○，一七八件。各業恢復和聯邦政府撥欵的影響。對於汽車銷路究竟增進多少。這是一時不容易說的。不過常例塡舊的數量。那沒可以計算得出來的。汽車塡舊是有繼續進展性的。要是有若干年不塡舊。那沒數量是要累進的。所以單就這一端來講。已經是可以樂觀的。美國所銷售的新私用客車和實業用的運貨汽車。已往四年的每年平均數爲二，○六八，七九四件。再前的五年其平均數爲三，五四六，一三○件。這里我們所應注意的。就是這五年期中是包括着一九二八和一九二九兩年汽車最暢銷的時期，不過事實上。那兩年間所售出的汽車。到現在是需要塡舊的。除非車主因爲經濟情形不好。在這不景氣的時期中不能添置或掉換新車。還有一件事。在已往的三年中。購置新車的車主很少。至於購買多輛汽車的。情形也相同。所以塡舊一事比較的很有把握哩。</p>
<p>據美國國民汽車會的計算。目下一輛汽車的壽命。大約七年又八個月。一九二九年時爲六年又九個月。卽使說一輛汽車的平均壽命爲八年。那末一九三五年到期的塡舊數應爲七，○○○，○○○輛。這個數目較之預計的一九三四年總產額要增加三倍哩。講到美國現有的汽車數。自從一九三零年以來。减低二，七○○，○○○輛。在現今情况之下，恐怕有許多車主還不能够購置新車。不過我們卽使將不註册的數目减去。那個塡舊數較之一九三三年也要多上兩倍。如果說一九三五年的美國汽車業。將以七，○○○，○○○輛應付一切需要爲不可靠。那末他的鉅數塡舊量當然誰多承認的了。</p>
<h3>史丹達廠的新陣容</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>地位穩固出品卓越</p>
<p>（一）環境的逼迫　大槪在十八個月之前。那時史丹達車廠的董事。大家坐在一起。考慮一九三四年的營業計劃。因爲他們承認汽車事業的復興。就在目前了。一九三一年的不景氣象形，將成爲過去的陳跡。而一九三三，三四的交替聲中。汽車的銷數。要增加些了。好多的車主。他們的汽車。一九三二年。一九三三年。早應換過了。但爲了經濟起見。並沒有添購新車。因此。情形好轉之後。私用汽車的定單。一定會突然的活躍起來。在另一方面。汽車的製造。有不少的改進。新的傾向。使小引擎得增加馬力，在這裏。除了增加汽車的速率而外。齒輪盒的變速。更非常便利。研究和實騐同時並進。使引擎的裝置。無聲而潤澤。絕無絲毫的不便。他如道路的不拘平坦與否。重量的减輕。風力抵禦的消除。甚至旅行汽車也有此種優點。至於物質的提高，工人工資的低减。一切的一切。直接簡接都足增進車輛的銷路的。</p>
<p>（二）偉大的計劃　在這種情形之下。史丹達車廠的董事會。便得到一個决議。他們的大「九匹」。小「九匹」。「十二匹」。「十六匹」。「二十匹」馬力的各種車輛。都是優美的汽車。在不景氣年頭。有過相當的銷路。但雖然這些車輛。製造得精美而堅固。在汽車的進展潮流中無疑。總應得要設法改進。否則便有失敗和淘汰的可能。因此。他們便拚命的去幹。在汽車市塲的上面。不景氣所予的斵傷。還沒有復原。車廠方面。非要努力去幹不可。而廠方便購買了甚多的新器具。新原料。建築了新的工廠。史丹達車廠終予在復興汽車業的意志之下。拚命的幹去。</p>
<p>（三）新車的製造　一九三三年九月史丹達廠宣稱上述五種車輛。完全革新的新車。已全部吿成。引擎的式樣和設計。車身。底盤。傳動。完全改革一新。附件完備。新車的問世。比預定的日期爲早。自一九三四式史丹達新車問世之後。所獲得的成功。竟出於當初董事會决定新策時的意外。營業方面。不久便接到無數的定單。此後銷數續有起色。社會方面。有不少人士。都購有一輛史丹達新車。直到一九三四年六月三十日爲止。史丹達的製成而銷售於市塲的。已有二○，○○○輛以上。</p>
<p>（四）車主的試騐　由過去的經騐上。我們知道每一個車廠。在製造新車的時候。雖謹愼小心。橫加檢騐。希望新車製成而後。絲毫沒有弊病。然偶然的小疵。原是免不了的。因此。新車一經問世。出品不到二十輛。便會發現若干不重要的缺點，然而車主方面。一般慣會批評的人。却就把這些缺點當做資料。加以指謫。所以事實上一種完美的新車。問世之初。每是得不到好評。日光頂的移動不便。齒輪捍移動時角度過大。門鈕放得不好看。這些都是小毛病。而苛刻的批評者。偏是要作爲吹毛求疵的好資料。可是史丹達新車。問世之後。這些小毛病。是完全沒有的。眞是一輛最完美的新車。動作。行駛。光澤。無聲。舒適。外觀。絕對沒有指謫的地方。因此。新車一經間世。便得到一般批評家的意外的好評。史丹達廠所標榜「製造社會所需要的汽車」一語。是適切的。社會正需要這樣的一種汽車丨丨這原因。史丹車的銷數。會日見增加起來</p>
<p>（五）範圍的擴大　這些新車。在一九三四年得有相當成功的。一九三五式的新車。依舊保留其各種優點。製造方面。又有不少改進。而基本上丨丨經過一年來試騐之後。非常滿意丨丨並無更變。因爲社會早已證明是優美的。不過除了上面幾種之外。更增加了兩種新車。一種是特别改造的「九正」新車。輪距略長。配有四門轎車身。另外一種便是「十丨丨十二特速」新車。這種新車。完全佔據了一個新的領域。外觀方面。完全和一九三五式「十匹」史丹達新車相同。但裏面潛伏着一種特殊的表演成績。將使每個旅行者滿意的。最高的速度。平均每小時可達七十哩。加速方面。（是在種種不同氣候下。不同道路上。試騐所得的結果。）完全停止的時候。在十六秒鐘之内。便可加到每小時行五十哩的速度。尤其神秘的便是一架特製的引擎。容種一六○八立方生的。有雙重化油器和鋁屬製的頭部。因此我們如果把史丹達一九三五式新車。一年來得有無上的成功的舊車加以改進的。和本年度全新製造者。計算一下。有下列幾種。（一）「九匹」馬力新車（兩門及四門）。（二）「十匹」馬力新車。（三）「十二匹」馬力新車。（四）「十丨丨十二」特速新車。（五）「十六匹」馬力新車。（六）「二十匹」馬力新車。</p>
<p>以上都是英國的標凖新車。代表出品。在未來的一年之中。一九三式式史丹達新車的銷數。無疑。又將超過一九三四年的紀錄呢。</p>
<h3>奧斯汀銷數激增</h3>
<p>僱工一萬九千名</p>
<p>頃據奧斯汀廠方消息。該廠現所僱用工友人數。實已突破歷來紀錄。蓋現在人數一萬九千名。較之一個月前。計增一千五百餘名之多。至於人數增加之原因。當然由工作忙碌。而工作所以忙碌。則此譽滿全球之奧斯汀汽車。銷數激增所致。此蓋可不言而喻者。按該廠出品。尤以七馬力式及十馬力四缸式新車。需要最爲殷亟。自該廠增加人數後。產額增高。差足適應此項與時俱增之熱烈需要。截至現在。小奧斯汀新車之銷數。卽較去年相同時期。亦且超過百分之二十。按去年銷數已足驚人。今竟駕而上之。故尤覺難能可貴云。</p>
<h3>道奇廠製造大批新車</h3>
<p>丨定單價値四千萬元丨</p>
<p>頃據一月二十八日美國帝特羅城電訊。價値四千萬元之汽車與運貨車定單。茲已由各州道奇經售商。分别交付於廠方派駐於二十五城市之辦事專員。按一九三五式道奇新車。據道奇公司推銷部總經理范德琦氏聲稱。業於各該城市舉行展覽云。</p>
<h3>芬尼士大會中福特之成功</h3>
<p>去年十月二十至二十一日。芬尼士汽車俱樂部第一次常年大會。十五名頭奬中。福特汽車占十二名。而其中九輛逹終點時。並無一分之損失。</p>
<p>此項試賽。取法蒙迭加羅大會賽之辦法。由芬蘭各處起賽。須行八五○哩之遙。達黑斯福。途中雨雪奇重。非常難行。</p>
<p>每段均有嚴格的時刻表。競賽者每分鐘之損失。或其車外部如有損傷。均須受罰。</p>
<p>在超過一五○○Ｃ·Ｃ·立方生的米達一類汽車中競賽者二十五人。内十二人到逹終點時。絲毫無分數之損失。其中駕駛福特汽車者不下九名。大都爲Ｖ八式車。</p>
<p>所有特别奬品中。大多數亦爲駕駛福特者所得。内有一種華大紀念奬品。爲嘉琳達爾女士所得。因伊駕駛彼之Ｖ八異常精練故也。</p>
<p>此次大賽中福特之成功。已引起芬蘭汽車界與一般社會普遍之注意矣。</p>

<h3>潘德奧勃林家中一封燒殘的情書</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>潘德奧勃林（ＰatＯ，Ｂrien）的家庭，是好萊塢最快樂的家庭之一，但是這個家庭的成功，以及他們兩個人的快樂，却是因於一封信的失而復得的。不然的話，他們的前途就不可測想了。也許他們却失敗了，連他們的名字都聽不見了。</p>
<p>那封遺失的信，是封航空信。飛機出了險而信遺失了。但是那封信，却是兩個人的生命之所繫。隔了半年，那封信又重發現了，而他們的新生命，這才從新開始起來。這是多麽危險的一椿事呀！</p>
<p>差不多六年以前，潘奧勃林和愛樂茜泰洛（ＥloiseＴaylor），同在地赤洛一個戲班裏作戲。他們兩個人的邏曼斯，是大家都知道的。他們是瘋狂似的相愛者，並且都計劃了在一節完結，休假開始的頭一天，就結婚出門度密月去。那天晚上，是一季最後的一晚，而在愛樂茜方面，却是終身最後的一次。登塲了。她是那樣的愛着潘德，她情願犧牲了自已的前途，去做潘德的良妻。她相信潘德的前途，一定是成功的。他不久就要在紐約百老匯登臺。他們都存着無限的希望。</p>
<p>但是就在那天晚上，他們爭吵起來了。那是很劇烈的口角，因爲那還是第一次口角哩。原因是極微細的一件事，連他們自已都說不淸是什麽事了。但是潘德那種愛爾蘭人剛强的脾氣，是一發而不可遇了。他說的話，都是在他平日所不會說的話。愛樂茜呢，她亦有她各别的脾氣。他們不久就互相謾駡起來，說的都是些不知所云的話。但是他們却同意於一點······就是他們的曼羅斯都是愚昧的舉動，而他們的婚姻，必定會鑄成終身之大錯的，不如即此分乎！他們都說，從此永遠不相見面了！</p>
<p>他們的爭吵，是在戲院裏的後台發生的。潘德在爭吵之後，立即回到客寓裏，整理了行裝，當晚就乘了火車到紐約去了。但是火車開了之後，潘德的脾氣就慢慢地銷下去了。等到他到了紐約，他悔喪萬分，自已駡着自已，爲什麽要做那種笨事。他想立刻坐了原車回地赤洛去，但是他記得愛樂茜曾說過永遠不要見他的話，或者那是她眞心的話呢。所以他想，還是先寫封信去賠罪的好。</p>
<p>他到了客棧裏，立即寫了一封信給愛樂茜。他用了十大張信紙，才寫完他心中的哀曲，種種抱歉，求她加以寛恕。最後，他還說倘使她不立即答復，他就認爲她眞的不要見他的面了，但是他亦不怪她，因爲她自已知道他是不配愛她的。</p>
<p>他將信用航郵寄去了。自此之後，他時時刻刻等着回信。電話鈴一響，或是有人一打門，他會驚跳起來的，但是他等了一天又一天，却是消息沉沉。他於失望之餘，所演的戲亦失敗了。他差不多貧困無聊得要自殺了。這樣，他一天一天的挨了六個月之久，忽然有一天，他接到了政府給他的一封信，裏面拆開一看，就是他六個月之前所寄給愛樂茜的那信長信。那封信已經燒燬得不成樣子了。所幸發信的地址還穩約看得出，所以就設法退了回來。原來那隻飛機出了事，他的信始終沒有送到。</p>
<p>潘德收到了那封退信，立即奔到電報局，打了一個長電給愛樂茜的家中，差不多和那封信一樣長。他於是回到客棧裏，從重焦急待候起來。但是這次等得並不長久。他收到了愛樂茜的回電，說她已經僥恕了他，並且說自從離别之後，她亦已日日在悔恨之中。潘德收到了那封電報，亦不再回復她。他來不及整理行裝，祇抓了一把牙刷，立即奔到愛樂茜所住的地方。他一到那裏，他們當天就結婚了。</p>
<p>那是五年多以前的事。自從他們結婚之後，潘德奧勃林亦就一帆風順，無往而不利。他在紐約重新登台，博得了戲劇界的盛譽。好萊塢聽見了他的名字，亦就聘請了他拍戲。他至今談起來，還歸功於他夫人内助之功哩。至於那封燒殘的信，他們將它配了鏡框，掛在書房裏。每次到了他們要爭吵的時候，他們祇要看了那鏡框，就一笑而罷了。</p>
<h3>一個好萊塢的人說</h3>
<p>— 祺官</p>
<p>一個好萊塢的人說：「如果拿西席爾地密里所導演的五十七部影片的拷貝接連起來，東西環繞地球一週後，還可以南北繞地球一週。」</p>
<p>「如果一個人得到紐約洛杉大戲院主人的允可，拿一天的售票收歸已有，立刻可以成一大富翁。」</p>
<p>「假使米高梅公司的攝影塲因事須完全掉換新的器具，紐約市上最大的百貨公司所有貨物拿出來，還不及米高梅攝影塲搬出來的三分之一。換句話說，米高梅攝影塲裏搬出來的器具可以開紐約最大的百貨公司三家而有餘。」</p>
<p>「拿紐約派拉蒙公司裏的一張世界第一大銀幕搬到地面上來，有三百個人可以很稀的站在上面。」</p>
<p>「全歐洲的電影院一共有一萬四千九百餘所，但是比美國一個國家所有的戲院尙少七千一百所。」</p>
<p>「如果有一個人能够拿全美國電影院一個月的收入完全聚集起來，沒有一個世界上的富翁能够同他分庭抗禮的了。這數目實在也難以計算。」</p>
<p>「世界上最大的一所露天影戲塲在好萊塢的皮佛萊山脚下，如果在冬天沒有用的時候當作飛機塲，可以容納像德國容克司號的飛機五十架之多。」</p>
<p>「假如派拉蒙影片公司出淸内部，拿所有的車輪拿出來拍賣，可以開一個很大的汽車公司，除了明星及導演用的以及私人用的之外，有三千二百輛。」</p>
<p>「如果好萊塢各影片公司中所有的飛機都開出去，飛在火奴魯魯的天空中，第二天一定有許多人認爲火奴魯魯起了軍事行動。」</p>
<h3>攝製中的「天倫」</h3>
<p>鍾石根「人生」之後的偉著「天倫」，由羅明佑費穆合導，早經攝製。此劇的宏偉，堪稱中國銀壇幾年來所未有。内容的充實動人，自無疑義，因爲在鍾氏的劇本中，你是找不對空泛無聊的東西，至於演員方面，這次差不多可稱爲全體明星大合作。林楚楚，陳燕燕，黎灼灼；張翼，鄭君里，黎鏗，尙冠武，梅琳······都在這裏大顯身手，這劇寫三個時代的故事中有三對夫妻，尙冠武與林楚楚，張翼與黎灼灼，鄭君里與梅琳。陳燕燕扮做楚楚冠武的女兒，黎鏗是幼年時期的鄭君里。現在。所拍的戲都是林楚楚與陳燕燕的重頭戲，因爲所拍的戲都是情感非常之重，所以她們都能眞的動情，尤其悲劇的部分收穫是萬分美滿。</p>
<p>「羣雌粥粥」中之一幕—南京映　滑稽祖師雪泥霍華德主演</p>
<h3>王人美痛哭流涕</h3>
<p>誰都知道，王人美是一頭愛跳躍的永遠沒有愁思的野貓。可是，當許幸之對她說，這一塲戲她得抱住牧之痛哭，越悲傷越好，在「風雲兒女」裏，這是一個高潮，影響全劇是很重要的，這時候，她立刻收住笑容，人是呆着了。</p>
<p>是的，痛哭，流涙，對一個沒有愁思的野貓，眞是太難了。於是，她呆呆地坐在沙法上，直到幸之通知她拍　時，她還是呆呆的站起來，走到袁牧之身邊，抱住了，默不作聲。</p>
<p>幸之的「開麥拉」喊出後，人美就抽噎着哭出聲來，是哭得那麽傷心的，在塲的人雖然以爲她是假哭，可是誰都驚着她怎麽哭得這樣逼眞。</p>
<p>但，牧之把臉抬起來後，祇見她已是涙涕縱橫了，而且，越哭越悲泣了。這樣，却把幸之急了，連忙喊「克脫」許是控制不住奔放着的情感吧！人美坐到沙發上還是不停地哭着。幸之勸了好一回，她才收住了哭。</p>
<p>事後，司徒慧敏從收音間裏跑出來對幸之說，這一塲人美的哭，在收音機上發出來，實在太感動人了。</p>

<h3>紅羊豪俠傳㈨</h3>
<p>— 兆初</p>
<p>曾石二人到了桂平縣署，在客廳上等候着，曾說道：「他如果收了我們的銀子，事情就妥當了」，正說着，一位戴眼鏡師爺般的老者，從内裏走了出來，向他二人笑着，拱手說：「恭喜恭喜，事情總算辦妥了，」那老者更緊急的繼續說：「事情可幾乎碰僵，他一定不肯收，是我說韋先生的罪，亦不過是李副將空架的，旣沒有眞憑實據，落得做個人情，」這才把事情辦妥了，曾玉衍連忙拱手招呼着說：「幸而靠王師爺大力，眞感激不盡，「說着，從衣袋取一捲小包，遞過老者之手，說道：「這點薄儀，略表我們的謝意，」那老嚷着不受，但結果收下了，一面說·「明天韋先生準可安全回家，二位放心好了，」於是曾石二位感謝着，辭别了出來，</p>
<p>明天，李殿元正在批着文件，那文案倉忙的奔了進來，向李說道：「韋昌輝，今天大早被知縣放走了，我探聽到昨天有人到縣裏去打關節，得了不少油水，」李副將聽了，氣得直立起來，駡着說：「這分明他要瞞過我，太欺負人了，大家都是朝廷的官員，我怎能和他甘休，』說着，把手裏的茶杯摔破在地下，李副將在屋裏走了一轉，又回過臉對文案說：「快去預備三十名馬快，等我親自去提韋昌輝回來，」文案答應了，連忙轉身走去，</p>
<p>在那出城的路上，韋昌輝神色很是萎頓，用一張軟椅，兩個人抬着行走，老家人在旁扶着說：「少爺，這眞是無妄之災，平白的受了這塲惡刑，」昌輝嘆着說：「這個世界，還有什麽是非曲直，靑紅皂白，」說着，一路走向前去，不料李副將領了二十多騎，飛奔而來，韋昌輝的轎子到了韋氏家祠門前，停下暫歇，李副將人馬隨後趕至，李見韋即行下馬，走到韋前，把韋抓了過來，老家人上前迴護，被推跌地下，李副將惡很很的問着說：「你怎麽逃走出來！」韋回答說：「縣裏因爲我沒有罪，釋放出來的，怎麽說我逃走呢，」李恨極駡道：「怎麽不經我的審問，」說了奪過隨從手裏所執的鞭子，向韋面上猛抽了一下，接着又是一脚，踼韋跌倒地下，李便喚着兵士說：「快把他綁了起來！等我親自來審問，」說着，就有幾個兵士上前，把他綁在樹上，李副將一手執着鞭，一手把韋的衣服扯去，說道：「你怎麽不找縣裏來包庇你，」說着一鞭又抽了下去，老家人耳朶裏聽着打的聲音，偷偷的掩在人背後，跑了過去，四面的鄕人都紛紛的圍立觀看，有幾個老的說：「怎麽打的是韋少爺啊，」韋昌輝受了打，忍受着，幾乎暈去了，口裏不住的哼着，李副將惡很很的，一邊打，一邊說：「我看你還有什麽分辯，」</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi, accompanied by Counselor Ariye, Secretary Horiuchi, and Clerk Yokokawa, arrived in Nanjing at 7:00 AM on the 29th via the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express train, with a reserved carriage. Suma, the Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, along with consulate staff, welcomed them at Xiaguan Station. After a brief exchange of greetings, Ariyoshi and his entourage left the station and proceeded by car to the Japanese Consulate-General for rest. According to Ariye, speaking to reporters at the station, Ambassador Ariyoshi routinely visits Nanjing every month or two to call on the Chinese Foreign Ministry. This visit is a routine one and does not involve any specific mission. The ambassador is scheduled to call on President Wang at 5:00 PM on the 29th and plans to visit Chairman Chiang on the 30th, but the time has not yet been confirmed. The ambassador is expected to return to Shanghai on the overnight express train on the evening of the 30th. He also mentioned that the situation in Eastern Chahar, according to recent reports from the embassy, has calmed down again, and both sides are discussing solutions. This is a local matter being handled by the Kwantung Army and the Hebei authorities. Rumors that the ambassador will soon return to Japan are inaccurate. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Review of the Review of Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>China and Japan are geographically so close, and their economic relations so intertwined. Yet, since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), their emotional ties have been broken, and they have been deadlocked to this day. As Xu Daolin said in his article "Enemy or Friend," "...they are heading further down a dead end." Whether the Japanese authorities will deeply reflect upon and sincerely improve relations between the two countries after Xu's review is unknown. However, informed individuals in that country should be able to make further assessments to break the Sino-Japanese deadlock. As for the attitude of our Chinese people toward Japan, we should look inward at ourselves and outward at the overall situation, making a very serious evaluation and consideration, and not continue to view Japan with animosity.</p>
<p>In the section where Xu explains "the advantages and disadvantages of prolonging the deadlock from China's perspective," he first quotes Sun Yat-sen's teachings, stating that China and Japan benefit from cooperation and suffer from conflict. This is especially evident during the recent surge in economic development alliances promoting nationalistic economies. If relations deteriorate to the end, our country will make unprecedented sacrifices to seek a glimmer of hope amidst certain death. The harm suffered by Japan, compared to ours, will likely exceed ours. Therefore, we hope that our countrymen will study Xu's article in depth, and especially that the Japanese side will carefully consider it, to find a way to break the deadlock. The talk of a second world war has been going on for a long time. Currently, it is restricted by economic conditions from breaking out immediately, but it will inevitably happen in the future. How should our country handle itself then? This is currently the most serious issue. All those who deeply understand international relations and the Far Eastern situation are concerned about this for our country. Xu said emphatically, "Maintaining neutrality..." is no different from a fool's dream..." His active proposal is "The only viable path... is to do everything possible to eliminate the chance of war..." and "...the Sino-Japanese issue, which is one of the causes of war, must be resolved..." These are wise words.</p>
<p>However, we believe that until the Sino-Japanese issue is resolved, the past cannot be thoroughly cleared up. Not only will Japan face tremendous obstacles, leading to complications and increasing future worries, but our country's intention for peace will also easily lead to misunderstandings from the Japanese side, even causing unfortunate results. This is because some of the "China experts" in Japan often have factual errors in their understanding in the positive aspect. For example, they have consistently lacked a full understanding of the progress of the Chinese revolution in the past, making malicious speculations, which has led to an irreconcilable conflict. Regarding national relations, they try their best to seek out China's shortcomings from the dark side, while having little understanding of the strengths and goodwill of the Chinese nation. Therefore, it is difficult for the people of both countries to find a path to sincere understanding. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has often subjected our country to unbearable humiliations, spreading the seeds of animosity between nations. If this continues, it will likely fall into an irretrievable situation. Xu described this kind of evil cause in great detail. This is what the Japanese side should first be aware of.</p>
<p>Recently, the entire world political situation, such as the easing of Franco-German opposition, the establishment of understanding between France and Italy, and the United States joining the International Court of Justice, all show signs of peace and reduce the floating war clouds. How the Far Eastern relations will develop is also up to human effort. If Japan is truly sincere in abandoning hatred and seeking friendship, and changes its past intentions, then the premise should be, as Xu said, first, "Abandon territorial aggression and return the four northeastern provinces!" Second, establish mutually beneficial relations based on the principle of equality of national interests. If these principles can be followed in order, then all outstanding issues between China and Japan can be resolved gradually, and there might be a glimmer of hope for breaking the current deadlock.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Reduction Delegate Yamamoto Leaves England to Return Home via Siberia</h3>
<p>(London) Yamamoto, the chief Japanese delegate to the Naval Conference, and other delegates, departed from here today to return home via Siberia. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Delegate Yamamoto and his entourage left London on the evening of the 28th to return home. They are scheduled to pass through Moscow on January 30th and arrive in Tokyo on February 12th. Yamamoto's return is not only to report on the progress of the preliminary talks but also to bring back a joint opinion paper from Yamamoto and Matsudaira, expressing the conclusions reached by the delegation, and requesting the government to consider it.

<p>Hull Exerts Himself to Secure US Entry into the World Court</p>
<h3>Senate Begins Final Debate</h3>
<p>(Washington) The issue of the United States joining the World Court, a decade-old matter, is showing a sudden turnaround in the Senate today. Secretary of State Hull personally went to the Senate this afternoon, partly to coordinate the final five-minute response with government-aligned senators and partly to meet with opposition leaders to carry out persuasive efforts. This case has been debated in the Senate for a week, and the final debate will begin tomorrow, so this major issue in American diplomatic history will reach the stage of a final vote.

<p>Japanese Spy Scare</p>
<h3>Radio Operator of Japanese Ship, Suspected of Dubious Behavior, Detained by American Secret Agents and Released Shortly After</h3>
<p>(New York) Another Japanese spy scare occurred here today, but it soon turned out to be nothing. A radio operator of a Japanese cargo ship was detained by American secret agents, questioned, and then released. The Japanese ship arrived here last week from Singapore via the Panama Canal. American secret agents, having received a tip from informants, detained the Japanese man, whose name has not been released. His notebook was searched, and he was subsequently released.

<p>Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet Union, Speaks on International Relations</p>
<h3>Denies Intention to Invade Xinjiang in China; Defenses are Secure, Not Afraid of Japan; Relations with Germany are Extremely Bad</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, today delivered a speech at the opening session of the Seventh Congress of Soviets, criticizing foreign criticism of the recent Soviet execution of political prisoners, saying that the Soviet government will continue to apply the same punishment to all enemies. Molotov also said that relations between the Soviet Union and China are very good and denied foreign reports that the Soviet Union intends to control Xinjiang. Molotov believed that some Japanese militarists particularly desire war, but the Soviet Union has strengthened its defenses and is fully prepared to deal with it. Relations with Germany, however, are extremely bad because Germany has plans to invade Soviet territory. Molotov further stated that the disarmament conference has completely failed, but the Soviet Union still hopes that it can create a permanent organization against war in the graveyard of Geneva. Molotov's speech focused on the economic progress of the Soviet Union, saying that since 1929, industrial output has risen by 139%, while the capitalist world outside the Soviet Union has declined by 24%. The Soviet Union's financial situation has also greatly improved since the last Congress of Soviets in 1931. Most importantly, cash income has increased sixfold, and foreign debt has decreased by three-quarters. Finally, Molotov again discussed the possibility of war in the Far East, saying that the number of Red Army soldiers has increased, and its mechanization has also greatly improved. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The All-Union Congress of Soviets opened here today, with a total of 2,000 representatives from all departments across the country attending. Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense, gave a passionate speech to the audience, strongly arguing that the Soviet Union's military strength should continue to be expanded. Molotov said that in the past four years, the mechanization of the Soviet Army has been four times higher than before. The Soviet Army now has more artillery batteries, tanks, and aircraft, and the defense projects in the East are more solid than before. However, Molotov acknowledged that the First Five-Year Plan was not fully implemented due to the surge in defense spending, which was not anticipated. Several representatives attending the meeting traveled hundreds of miles through icy and snowy lands on sledges pulled by reindeer. Stalin was warmly welcomed by the representatives when he entered the venue, and the cheers lasted for more than five minutes. Molotov continued, "We must consider that the danger of war against Russia is now greater than before. Responsible parties in Japan have long openly discussed war against Russia, and we must not forget that there are new parties in power in Europe who openly declare that occupying Soviet territory is their historical mission. Since the rise of the German National Socialist Party, no one can turn a blind eye to the changes in Russian-German relations." Molotov then mentioned Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" and asked the audience, "Are Hitler's remarks about the necessity of territorial aggression in Eastern Europe still valid today? When the National Socialist Party speaks of new territories in Europe, are they still thinking of Russia and its neighbors?" Molotov continued that Hitler's words are clearly still valid because, apart from Germany's attitude toward the Eastern European treaties, many events in Russian-German relations can only be understood with reference to this issue. Molotov concluded, "We must decide our own views." (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) When Molotov spoke, he commented on the relations between the Soviet Union and China, saying, "Sino-Soviet relations, which were damaged after the oppression of Soviet elements in China in 1928, have now been restored. The Chinese government clearly believes that the break in relations was not only not beneficial to China but also made its international position worse. Some people may need this kind of practical and objective lesson, but that is their own business and does not concern us. We knew at that time (as we do now) that correct Sino-Soviet relations are beneficial to both countries and to world peace. Therefore, when the Chinese government proposed the resumption of relations with the Soviet Union, we gladly accepted, so that our country can consolidate friendship with the great Chinese people. I would like to briefly address the malicious rumors of the 'Sovietization' of Xinjiang again. These anti-Soviet rumors were clearly created by Japan, and Japan's policy towards China is already known to everyone and cannot be concealed by spreading rumors. I must solemnly point out that the Soviet Union's actual policy towards China, the policy of seizing foreign territory, is not suitable for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union unconditionally supports the independence and inviolability of all parts of China (including Xinjiang)." (TASS, 29th)</p>
<p>Japanese House of Representatives Questions Military Spending Issues</p>
<h3>Ogawa Says Internal and External Atmosphere is Uneasy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The confrontational state between the government and the Seiyukai party in the House of Representatives budget committee remains unchanged. Today's meeting began with Ogawa Gotaro questioning national defense finance issues.</p>
<p>Ogawa asked, "Today's situation is extraordinarily serious. The internal and external atmosphere is uneasy. Eliminating this uneasy atmosphere is a political matter. Therefore, the cabinet's policies must be clearly defined. Is there a distinction in importance between the government's ten major policy plans, establishing finance and protecting national defense? What is the Prime Minister's view on this?"</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied, "There is no distinction in importance between national defense security and the establishment of finance."</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi and Minister of the Navy Osumi also gave the same response.</p>
<p>Ogawa further asked, "It is heard that the Ministers of the Army and Navy acknowledged the coordination of national defense and economic power at the previous cabinet meeting. Is this true? What are Foreign Minister Hirota's observations regarding the outcome of the disarmament conference? According to the Foreign Minister's statements, war will not occur. Then, will naval military spending be reduced because of this?"</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied, "My belief is that war will not occur. There has been no change in this so far. If the disarmament conference is successful, then naval military spending should be reduced."</p>
<p>Ogawa asked, "The so-called 'war will not occur,' does that mean you have hope for the disarmament conference? Then, can the Foreign Minister's true intention be interpreted as the result of disarmament will allow for thorough savings in naval military spending in the future?"</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied, "I hope that the disarmament agreement will be established. If it can be established, it will be possible to thoroughly save naval military spending. Therefore, I hope that the people will work together to promote the disarmament conference."</p>
<p>Ogawa asked, "What are the Navy Minister's observations regarding the above issue?"</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi replied, "If the disarmament conference can be established, it would be best. We are working hard under this policy."</p>
<p>Ogawa asked, "If the disarmament conference breaks down, will a naval arms race occur? The general public is anxious about this, which gives the financial world anxiety. We would like to hear the government's opinion on this."</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi's response was the same as what he said in the Diet last time and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>Ogawa asked, "If the disarmament conference breaks down, it is said that the people must have extraordinary determination. What does this statement mean? Please explain."</p>
<p>Navy Minister Osumi replied, "As the disarmament conference is not yet clear today, it is not appropriate to talk about situations that could cause misunderstandings. Countries today all hope not to increase the burden on their people, and there is concern that an unfortunate military expansion competition will occur in the future. If we want to take it further and make various predictions, I feel it is inappropriate to discuss. I believe that even if the disarmament conference breaks down, we can continue to support it with the current military spending, and the situation will not be much different. I have the belief that we can support it."</p>
<p>The questioning ended here, and a recess was announced. It was 0:10 AM. It was originally planned to continue the budget committee meeting in the afternoon, but due to the time constraints of the main session, the meeting was adjourned. (Japan Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Amidst Rumors of the Sale of the CER, the United States Publishes Documents</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Issues Statement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The U.S. State Department's publication on the 26th of the exchange of official documents between Japan and the United States regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) issue has had a great impact on all parties. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding this issue, saying that the U.S. government's publication of diplomatic documents is a customary practice and not a strange event. The U.S. government sought Japan's opinion on the publication of documents regarding Japan's dispatch of troops to Siberia in August of the previous year. The Foreign Ministry replied that all except for certain parts could be published. The documents published on the 26th appear to be those documents. It is rumored that it is related to the establishment of negotiations on the sale of the CER. However, the United States recognized at the Washington Conference that the ownership and property of the CER belonged to the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is no reason for the U.S. government to deny the establishment of negotiations on the CER. The Foreign Ministry will take appropriate measures after receiving a cable from the embassy in the United States. (Japan Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<h3>Former Governor of Hong Kong Writes Article Advocating for Relocation of British Embassy to the South</h3>
<p>(London) The Times published an article written by Sir Cecil Clementi, former Governor of the British Straits Settlements, arguing that the British Embassy in China should not be located in Beijing. His reasons were that "It is now easy for Europeans to understand that Beijing is isolated from the trends of Chinese people's lives. It is not the true capital of China. In the past, northern peoples invaded the Central Plains and established their capital here to control the eighteen provinces. Now, the Chinese government has established its capital in Nanjing. For the sake of a good understanding between Europe and China, Europeans should eliminate the illusion that Beijing represents a unified China. If its people were to choose their own capital, it would definitely not be Beijing. All those who are familiar with the facts of China should deeply believe this. As Beijing is now merely a city government located in a remote corner of China, it is not appropriate for foreign diplomatic representatives to be stationed in Beijing. However, given the current situation in Beijing, it is quite difficult to choose another suitable place for foreign envoys to reside. The purpose of British merchants is to engage in peaceful and prosperous trade with all parts of China, and the task of British diplomatic envoys is to maintain friendly relations with the de facto authorities in the eighteen provinces of China. Therefore, in my personal opinion, the British Embassy should be temporarily located in Shanghai, as Shanghai is a transportation hub and is very close to Nanjing. It is more convenient for the British Ambassador to reside in Shanghai permanently and travel to various parts of China at any time." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>British Government Promotes Far East Aviation Plan</h3>
<p>(London) The British government is planning to establish rapid air transport between the various parts of the Empire. This plan was announced by Under-Secretary of State for Air Sassoon in the House of Commons on December 20 of last year. Today, delegations from the Air Ministry and the Post Office departed from Croydon Aerodrome to fly to the Far East to liaise with experts in India, Siam, Australia, and other places to prepare for the matter. According to the above plan, it will only be realized after two years. At that time, it will only take four days to fly from the UK mainland to South Africa, seven days to Australia, and only two days to India. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, representatives from the Air Ministry and the Post Office departed for India, Siam, Singapore, and Australia. The purpose is to study the organization and cooperation of the British Empire's aviation industry with local experts to promote the plan announced by Minister of Aviation Sassoon in the House of Commons last month. The delegation includes three members of the House of Commons. The points to be considered are three: (1) improving existing aircraft schedules, (2) increasing the number of flights, (3) loading first-class mail, charging rates similar to ordinary mail.

<p>British House of Commons Debates Supplementary Budget</p>
<h3>Disturbance Occurs in Solemn Chamber</h3>
<p>Labor MP Scorns Prime Minister as Fox Spirit</p>
<p>Spectators Shout "Down with the Government" in Response</p>
<p>Sixty Demonstrators Expelled from Chamber</p>
<p>(London) Last night, when the House of Commons debated a supplementary budget of £5 million to fund the new Unemployment Assistance Board, a great disturbance occurred in the spectator gallery. First, Labour MP Buchanan spoke, defaming Prime Minister MacDonald, calling him a "fox spirit," "pig," "scoundrel," and "villain," and saying he should be whipped with a riding crop and banished from public life. The MPs were astonished to hear this. Then, women in the spectator gallery stood up and shouted, "Down with the National Government," "Down with those who starve babies." Just as the demonstrators were being escorted out of the House by the police, others stood up and continued the demonstration. The chaos was indescribable and lasted for several minutes. A total of sixty people were expelled. Then, Speaker FitzRoy ordered all those in the spectator gallery to leave the House, and they left reluctantly. The House then resumed its discussion. Before Buchanan insulted the government, the government's proposals to relieve unemployment had been warmly condemned. The Unemployment Assistance Board has now been ordered to standardize the regulations for relief to healthy unemployed workers nationwide. Buchanan is one of the most radical Labour MPs in the House. He has been a representative of Glasgow since 1922. He studied at Cowcaddens Public School in Glasgow and later engaged in the labor movement. He was elected as a member of the Glasgow City Council in 1918 and is now 54 years old. Today, he was referred to as a "hero" by those in the spectator gallery. Prime Minister MacDonald did not attend the House of Commons today and therefore did not personally hear Buchanan's attack. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>This Session's Agenda</h3>
<p>(London) The reopening of the British Parliament this time resembles the eve of a general election. The agenda for this session includes numerous proposals. The government has submitted seven bills, the most important of which are the Indian New Constitution Bill and the Unemployment Extra Relief Fund Bill. The Cabinet predicts that the next budget will be a "prosperity budget." If the financial economy truly enters a prosperous period, then all of the Labor Party's accusations can be fundamentally eliminated. If, by the end of this parliamentary session, the financial situation and the "Poverty Class Relief Committee" established by the government both achieve satisfactory results, the government will hold a general election in October of this year to gain the people's trust. If, by that time, the government's various measures have not yielded results, then the general election will be postponed to February 1936. In addition, there are various other issues that are sufficient to affect the political situation and make it uncertain. The first is the government's foreign policy. The British government's attitude towards the arms issue and various international conventions is attracting great attention from public opinion. Before French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval come to London, several questions have already been listed on the parliamentary agenda, awaiting Foreign Minister Simon's response. The second is the return of the Liberal Party elder and former Prime Minister Lloyd George to the political stage. Lloyd George has recently been giving speeches everywhere, attacking the government and vigorously advocating for a controlled economy. Even if this move does not endanger the position and reputation of the National Government, it will at least provide a strong stimulus to the current government. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Western Australia Applies to Secede from the Australian Federation</p>
<h3>British Houses of Parliament Form Joint Committee to Consider</h3>
<p>(London) Colonial Secretary James replied to questions in the House of Commons today, stating that the British government has decided to submit the petition of Western Australia to secede from the Australian Federation to a joint committee formed by both houses of parliament because the petition was addressed to both houses. The petition was submitted to Parliament on December 17, requesting secession from the Australian Federation and restoration of its former status as an autonomous colony. The main reason for the secession is that Australia's protectionist tariffs and free trade system between the states are too unfair, causing great hardship to Western Australia. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Depart for England Tomorrow</p>
<h3>Armaments and Finance as Talking Points, Launching Large-Scale Diplomatic Action</h3>
<p>(London) French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval are scheduled to visit British government officials on Thursday of this week. Prime Minister MacDonald will host a banquet for the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister at the Foreign Office on Friday evening, and the French Embassy in England will host a banquet for British and French cabinet members on Saturday at noon. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval held further talks with British Ambassador Clerk today, discussing the details of the Anglo-French talks to be held during Prime Minister Flandin's and Laval's visit to London. After the meeting between Laval and Clerk, Prime Minister Flandin declared to reporters that their trip to London was of an exchange-of-views nature, with no so-called negotiations or meetings. It was merely a "friendly meeting between the authorities of the two countries" to discuss the current situation and possible solutions to various outstanding issues, so this trip would not lead to any resolutions. In short, this is only the beginning of a large-scale diplomatic action initiated by Britain and France. As for the security guarantees proposed by the British side, the French government authorities feel that they are still insufficient. Therefore, the French side also believes that the return of Germany to the League of Nations and the abolition of the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, as advocated by Britain, are premature, and a more feasible new approach must be found to enable Germany to return to Geneva, etc. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political circles are keeping the talks between Foreign Minister Laval and British Ambassador Clerk today very secret. It is generally believed that the discussions concern the issue of armaments. However, responsible persons say that the talks between Laval and Clerk, as well as the subsequent Anglo-French talks in London, will not go beyond the scope of exchanging views between the two governments. Since the two countries have always cooperated in good faith, key figures from both countries must exchange views at regular intervals, which has become a convention. Before departing for London, Laval may hold another talk with the British Ambassador. Prime Minister Flandin also met with the President of the Bank of France, Tannery, and the Minister of Finance, Germain-Martin, to consult on international financial issues before going to England. However, rumors in the newspapers that Finance Minister Germain-Martin will also accompany him to England are inaccurate. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet meeting tomorrow afternoon will decide on the French Prime Minister's and Foreign Minister's approach to the future disarmament conference in London. The Army and Navy ministries have prepared detailed reports on France's national defense needs specifically for this purpose, which will be submitted for discussion at that time, so that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister can clearly answer when Britain asks about France's lowest security needs. France's answer will be, "To what extent is your country contributing to security?" Therefore, in this good talk, each country will be an interrogator and also a subject of interrogation. It is hoped that the discussions to be held in London this week will facilitate future negotiations between other European governments. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<p>Protecting Marine Territories, US Organizes Air Force Headquarters</p>
<h3>Commanding the Air Force to Deal with Contingencies, Wake Island to Be Developed as a Air Station</h3>
<p>(Washington) Army officials and senior officers are all eager for the newly organized Air Force Headquarters to protect America's marine territories. Chief of Staff McArthur declared today that after the establishment of the new organizational law, the national air defense's activity will be much different than in the past. McArthur also said, "I plan to use the Air Force to deal with all contingencies when necessary, whether it is in Panama, Hawaii, or the Philippines, all can be done. A powerful Air Force can reach the Philippines via Hawaii and Guam. In short, I will send the Air Force to any location when necessary." According to the new plan, the US Air Force will maintain full strength at all times, unlike the infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which are reduced to very small numbers in peacetime. In the event that the enemy breaks through the US Navy and lands on the mainland or any marine territory, the new air defense plan will immediately dispatch the Air Force to prevent the enemy from expanding the occupied area, pending the arrival of the Army to engage in battle. Army aviation experts are now studying how to fly to the Philippines via the US-owned islands in the Pacific. The first step may be to use Wake Island, which is 2,200 miles west of Hawaii and 2,600 miles east of the Philippines, as a base for seaplanes. Recently, Navy Secretary Swanson said that the project of developing Wake Island as a commercial aviation field in the Pacific is under consideration. According to the plan of the Air Force Headquarters, five military stations will also be established on the US mainland, each with 200 aircraft permanently stationed, but ready to fly to threatened locations at any time.

<p>US Rear Admiral Advocates Expanding Naval Armaments</p>
<h3>What Do Japanese Naval Minister's Remarks Refer To? Generally Believed to Be Aimed at Russia</h3>
<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral King testified before the House Naval Affairs Committee today on the current state of the US Navy, advocating for adding naval armaments, such as aircraft equipment, in addition to the current naval construction plan. After the air force expansion plan is completed, the naval fleet must have more aircraft barges to load them. In addition, he also advocated building new airships for training purposes. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) In his statement to the House of Peers yesterday, Japanese Naval Minister Osumi said, "If there is any country intending to expand armaments..." Officials here heard this and did not know what he was referring to. Naval authorities here stated that the United States has no intention of building a navy exceeding the Washington Treaty's provisions. If no other country initiates it, the United States has no intention of engaging in naval competition. The current US Navy is still 78 ships short of the treaty limit, and the Navy Secretary's request to add only 14 ships will not allow the US Navy to reach the treaty limit until 1942. Some believe that Naval Minister Osumi's remarks were only made for domestic consumption, or were aimed at Russia, as Soviet Russia has recently concentrated a submarine fleet in Vladivostok.

<p>Controlling Arms Manufacturing Plan, US Secretary of War's Warning</p>
<h3>Says It Could Endanger the Entire National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the issue of arms manufacturing in the United States, since Representative McSwain introduced the government control bill, debates on this matter have been rampant. Secretary of War Dern issued a warning to the House Military Affairs Committee today, saying that if Congress wants to limit the profits of arms manufacturers, do not neglect the needs of national defense. The Secretary of War also said that while he strongly agrees with the principles of the McSwain bill, he is still concerned that it could endanger the United States, so he hopes that Congress will not act rashly, recklessly destroying military preparations, resulting in losing the opportunity to win in the next war, which may be necessary. Government control of arms manufacturing may affect the entire national defense plan. (National News Agency, 28th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Orders Large Batch of British Machinery Worth One Million Pounds</h3>
<p>(London) The Soviet Arkos Trading Company has ordered machinery and factory equipment worth one million pounds from Britain.

<p>US and Russia Joining the Governing Body Creates Difficulties for the ILO</p>
<h3>No Vacancies in the Current Eight Seats, Committee Studies New Methods</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' International Labor Organization Governing Body met here today, and the accession of the United States and Soviet Russia has created difficulties. According to the Treaty of Versailles, only representatives of the eight major industrial countries can serve as permanent directors. The so-called eight major industrial countries are Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Italy, and Japan. If the US and Russia join the ILO, they must each occupy a permanent seat, and at present it is not easy to obtain two vacancies. Although Japan has announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, it still retains its membership in the ILO. Germany's seat must also be left vacant, as Germany may return to the League of Nations. Therefore, it is quite difficult and cannot be resolved without a voting method. If two permanent seats must be added, it will take several years of twists and turns. The ILO has now formed a committee of experts to study a new method so that two of the eight countries' representatives can give up their permanent seats. However, this report must wait for the next meeting to be discussed, and it is still questionable whether a solution can be found, so the results may have to be referred to the League of Nations Administrative Council. In addition, there is another difficulty, which is how Soviet Russia can comply with the regulations and send representatives from both labor and capital to attend the ILO.

<h3>Zaibatsu and Military Clash in the Dark</h3>
<p>Financial Contradictions Gradually Exposed</p>
<p>Military Preparations Turning More Active</p>
<p>The disharmony between the civilian government faction and the military in Japan is an open secret that need not be concealed. However, Japan is ultimately a country ruled by law, and its political institutions all have a set framework. Therefore, no matter how powerful the military is, it cannot overstep the boundaries and disregard national law. Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese soldiers have achieved great feats, while the political parties have made no achievements, and cases of embezzlement and bribery have repeatedly emerged. For example, the Teikoku Rayon Company case involved several cabinet members from the Saito Cabinet era. These individuals, including Mitsui, Nakajima, and others, had close ties with the Seiyukai party. As a result, the military became increasingly assertive, and public opinion favored the military and looked down on the political parties. Parliamentary politics existed only in name.</p>
<p>Young military officers (from major to colonel) combined with various patriotic organizations to advocate for the "Restoration of the Imperial Country, Showa Restoration," externally expanding the continental policy and proclaiming the Asia Monroe Doctrine, and internally advocating for national defense and opposing the control of the political situation by financial capital. In rural areas, they promoted land policies, even advocating for returning land to the Emperor and redistributing it. In urban areas, they focused on small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses and opposed the monopolistic interests of financial capital. The established political parties, the Seiyukai and the Minseito, all had large financial capital as their backing and supported their monopolistic interests. Therefore, most military officers from small and medium-sized industrial and commercial backgrounds and rural areas were anti-political party and supported various right-leaning patriotic organizations to oppose the political parties. Thus, at the beginning of the establishment of Manchukuo, the military hardliners (i.e., young military officers) had a huge conflict with the local Japanese zaibatsu. The reflection of this in upper-level politics was the open and covert strife between the military headquarters, the embassy, and the governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory in "Manchuria." In Japan, the army ministry, the foreign ministry, and the colonial ministry each acted on its own. It was not until Hirota became foreign minister that the relationship between the army and the foreign ministry gradually improved, while the colonial bureaucrats and the army remained at odds. From the Saito cabinet until November of last year, this kind of dispute did not ease. Unexpectedly, the military used its special powers to set up a special agency in Dalian to implement strong control, and the bureaucrats had to retreat in order to preserve some of their power. Initially, they wanted to divide the interests with the military equally along the South Manchurian Railway line and in the other four northeastern provinces. Later, given the power of the military, they planned to retain the last vestige of colonial control over the Kwantung Leased Territory (Liaodong Peninsula). After the establishment of the Dalian Special Agency, international commercial telecommunications</p>

<p>The colonial bureaucrats no longer dare to take any action. Even the major capitalists, such as the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Furukawa zaibatsu, are unwilling to lightly invest in the Northeast, fearing that if things change, their assets and businesses will be wiped out.</p>
<p>The original intention of the zaibatsu was to hope that the military could gradually comply and completely obey the instructions of financial capital, and to constantly use parliamentary politics to restore the so-called constitutional normalcy and form a political dictatorship of financial capital. All rights in "Manchuria" must be controlled by the zaibatsu, or at least they should have the right to intervene. Unexpectedly, the military's behavior was completely the opposite. It was impossible to obey the zaibatsu, and even equal consultation required serious instructions from the military, resembling an appendage. This situation is obvious to all.</p>
<p>Recently, in the so-called Japan-Manchukuo Economic Conference, the zaibatsu believed that the economic trends in Japan this year mostly showed signs of deterioration. For example, the excessive issuance of government bonds was likely to cause vicious inflation. Various countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, were trying to control their own markets, and it was difficult to further develop the export of light industrial products. Therefore, they planned to seize a large number of economic benefits in the Northeast to compensate for the lack of foreign exports. However, the Japanese military's intention was completely the opposite. The so-called Japan-Manchukuo economic cooperation placed the highest priority on Japan's national defense. Therefore, joint ventures were mainly special companies. Second, the conference location was in Changchun. Third, the four Japanese committee members were the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, the Counselor of the Embassy, the Director-General of the Kwantung Bureau, and representatives appointed by the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs. They formed a joint organization with an equal number of people from the Manchukuo side. Japanese capitalists were not allowed to participate, and even offering opinions was not allowed. Initially, what they had hoped for was: 1) the conference in Tokyo; 2) at least two representatives from the zaibatsu participating; 3) mainly benefiting the Japanese financial community. Now that the conference has been fully revealed, the zaibatsu's expectations have been dashed. They expressed dissatisfaction with the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Conference, believing that it would hinder the prospect of investment and have a very bad impact on the Japanese economic community. The Economic Conference not only looked down on the zaibatsu and did not allow them to participate, but its organization was also completely controlled by the Kwantung Army and was merely a special agency of the Kwantung Army. As a result, the dark strife between the military and the zaibatsu will turn into open struggle. Recent trends suggest that victory may ultimately go to the military. (January 24, Tokyo)</p>
<h3>Eastern Chahar After the Japanese Bombing</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Suddenly Increase and Decrease, Intentions Unclear</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers and Civilians Have Been Sent to Zhangjiakou for Treatment</p>
<p>Negotiation Location Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the Chahar East issue, both sides are seeking a peaceful solution. However, the Japanese and puppet troops have been continuously increasing their forces and transferring them in various parts of Chahar East in recent days. According to a phone call from Zhangjiakou this morning (27th), Japanese troops in Changliang, Xifengzhai, North and South Shizhuzi, and Datan suddenly increased and decreased their forces, with unclear intentions. Aircraft have been scouting Guyuan and Dushikou from time to time, but have not yet dropped bombs. Our troops have not been mobilized at all. A total of 37 soldiers and civilians who were injured by Japanese aircraft bombing in the Dongzhaizi and Dushikou areas were transported to Zhangjiakou for treatment from Dushikou at 6:00 PM on the 25th. According to injured personnel, most of the injured were residents of Guyuan Twenty Mile Fort, Dongzhaizi, and Dushikou. When Japanese aircraft dropped bombs, they flew at extremely low altitudes, only three or four zhang away from the houses, so the bombing was exceptionally accurate. The original 40-odd households in Dongzhaizi have now been completely evacuated, except for the injured. All houses have been destroyed by aircraft and artillery fire, turning into a scorched earth, which is extremely miserable. Only government agencies such as the county government, public security bureau, and court, and a few households of residents remain in Guyuan City. Districts 2 and 4 were occupied by Japanese and puppet troops long ago. Outside Dushikou, there are no formal troops stationed on our side. Japanese and puppet troops have advanced to Xifengzhai and Wuni, approaching the Great Wall line, and increasing troops in those areas. According to people from Yanqing, Japanese and puppet troops sent personnel to the Sihai area of the county a few days ago, forcibly designating the area as a puppet state territory and demanding that households pay taxes. The local people are still very calm.</p>
<p>Regarding negotiation information, the Japanese representatives Matsui and Takahashi cannot make decisions on their own. The Japanese side proposes that the negotiation location be in Chengde, Datan, Gubeikou, or Shanhaiguan, while our side believes that it would be more convenient to be in Beiping or Tianjin. Matsui and Takahashi have telegraphed the Kwantung Army for instructions. Contact can only begin after a reply. Xiao Zhenying went to Juren Hall again on the morning of the 27th to visit He Yingqin. According to Xiao, the Chahar Province has telegraphed the central government on the continuous situation and the losses caused by Japanese aircraft bombing. All negotiation matters are subject to the central government's orders. (January 27)</p>
<h3>Rural Reconstruction Commission Investigates Anhui Province's Rice Industry</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Committee Members Supervise Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: When the collection of relief grain in Anhui Province was suspended, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan telegraphed Anhui Chairman Liu Zhenhua, saying that the disaster relief after the bandit suppression in southern Anhui would be assisted in other ways, and the Ministry of Finance and the Rural Reconstruction Commission would send personnel to Anhui to investigate in order to seek relief methods. After receiving the order, the Rural Reconstruction Commission sent Secretary Li Jingmi, specialist Lin Xizhao, commissioner Sun Xiaocun, and investigator Liao Fengqin to Anqing to investigate first. Last night, they took a ship from Anqing to Wuhu and met with Yuan Doushu, the representative of the Anhui Province Sail Transportation Rice Industry in Wuhu, and Li Dachu, the chairman of the Transportation Industry Association, to inquire in detail about the recent situation of the rice industry. The Reconstruction Commission's investigation paid special attention to the three aspects of production, transportation, and sales of rice in Anhui Province, intending to analyze and statistically improve the export of Anhui rice. At the same time, the relief grain previously collected in Anhui Province must also be investigated clearly in order to determine the post-disaster relief methods after the relief grain is revoked. Li et al. have reported the details of the rice production and sales investigation in Wuhu to the Reconstruction Commission in order to determine the principles for reconstructing the rural areas of Anhui Province based on the surplus and deficiency of various parts of the country. It is also heard that the investigators will transfer to North China to work after the matters in Wuhu are completed.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Relief Grain Collection Office in Anhui Province, it has collected about 100,000 shi of relief rice and stipulated distribution rules. All counties receiving relief grain must appoint commissioners to supervise the implementation of emergency relief agricultural loans and price stabilization together with the county magistrates. If the county magistrate is perfunctory or engages in malfeasance in relief affairs, the committee may report to the provincial government to dismiss or punish him with salary deductions or record demerits. It is now found that there are 39 counties receiving relief grain, including Huaining. However, in order to save travel expenses, it has been decided by the provincial government's quick discussion to assign one supervisory commissioner for every three counties, who will depart immediately to handle matters together with the county, thereby providing relief.

<h3>Fellow Townsmen from Wuyuan Oppose the Sale of the Nanjing Examination Hall</h3>
<p>Beijing News: The Nanjing Wuyuan Examination Hall used to be a place for scholars from the hometown to stay when they came to Beijing for the provincial examination from afar. The building is magnificent and spacious. Since the abolition of the imperial examination system, it has become a convenient place for fellow townsmen traveling abroad. It also has annual rents and other attached market house rents, totaling more than a thousand yuan, which can cover expenses. In recent years, it has been managed by the Wuyuan Education Bureau on behalf of the Wuyuan community, and the surplus is used to subsidize local education. It is not official property. Recently, it has been heard that the Wude Road is lacking funds for construction, and the Wuyuan Temporary Local Clearing and Rehabilitation Committee, Finance Committee, Chamber of Commerce, and Tea Merchants Association are planning to sell the hall to fund the road construction. Fellow townsmen from various places are protesting. The letter from the Wuyuan Fellow Townsmen Association in Changzhou is recorded as follows: "Gentlemen of the four groups, Upon receiving letters from the fellow townsmen associations in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuxi, etc., we have read that you are proposing to sell the Nanjing Wuyuan Examination Hall for road construction expenses due to the urgent need for funds for Wude Road and the difficulty in raising funds among families. It is not impossible to do this in principle. Since the imperial examination system was abolished, there is no need for the existence of an examination hall in its literal sense. However, we remember that the examination hall was established by the wise men of the past, is grand in scale, and benefits the local scholars. It is located in the Gu Lou Kou area. Although transportation is not extremely convenient, in today's rapidly developing capital construction, things are changing every month and day. Who knows that it will not be a bustling city in the future? According to land value, it changes with the prosperity of the market. If Gu Lou Kou becomes a bustling market one day, the value of the examination hall's land alone will be worth at least 100,000. Its accompanying real estate is not without hope. In terms of benefits, it seems appropriate to be patient for a moment and wait for the opportunity. If you are drinking poison to quench your thirst and are too hasty to choose, selling such a promising property at a cheap price, even if the Wuyuan community remains silent, you will feel ashamed to face the wise men of the past. Furthermore, Wude Road is another issue. If fellow townsmen abroad are asked to bear the road construction expenses as a condition for not selling the examination hall, it seems even more unreasonable. Your enthusiasm for roads and benefiting the hometown is deeply admired by overseas compatriots. We hope that you will seek other ways and temporarily retain the examination hall to wait for the opportunity, and announce the full assets and current status of the examination hall so that fellow townsmen groups in Jiangsu can jointly assist in the handling to avoid loss and prevent encroachment. We await your response. With sincere regards."</p>

<h3>Provincial Committee Member Collects Tax Funds in Person</h3>
<p>Xie Zhaonan, an accounting specialist sent by the Provincial Department of Finance, has come to Songjiang to personally collect the special national tax funds of Songjiang County. The county magistrate strictly ordered the national tax collection directors Yang and Pan to first arrange for payment.

Compared with the achievements of various counties, Songjiang County is still among the first batch of tax payers. It is heard that the remaining funds must be paid by February 1. Although the harvest in this county is relatively good, the national tax collection is not as good as last year, so the two directors are very anxious.</p>

Various granaries and offices have reported meager collection amounts. Furthermore, it has been discovered that tenants from fields marked with "Du Men Li Mei Jing Shang Ye" and other designations have jointly contacted neighboring "Hao Zhu Ju He" and other areas, using the disaster as an excuse to attempt to resist paying rent. The landlords of these granaries and offices, including Yang Baoye, Bao Ziyu Hua, and Cai Yishu, believing that they are secretly colluding and the situation is serious, specially submitted a request to the county government yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation and urging the heads of each area to promptly persuade them to avoid inciting unrest and to ensure the proper payment of rent.</p>

<h3>Enemy or Friend? (4) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xu Daolin</p>
<p>丨Review of Sino-Japanese Relations丨</p>
<p>(7) Key Points and Paths to Be Recognized and Adopted by China and Japan</p>
<p>Understanding the various errors of China and Japan mentioned above clarifies the reasons for the evolution of the September 18th Incident into a stalemate. It goes without saying that the stalemate should not be prolonged. The opposite of error is truth. By examining the reverse of the points mentioned above, one can discover what China and Japan should recognize and the paths they should take. The above discussion is extremely detailed, so I will only summarize them as follows:</p>
<p>Paths to be Recognized and Adopted by China　The initiative to break the Sino-Japanese stalemate certainly lies with Japan. However, assuming Japan sincerely expresses its intentions, what should China do? I believe that China should recognize that arrogance is not a solution, procrastination is not a solution, stagnation is not a solution, expecting or relying on others is not a solution, and sacrificing reason for emotion is not a solution. The mistakes of the past were due to arrogance, so from now on, the entire country should recognize the facts, have confidence in its own future, and not ignore its own weaknesses. Furthermore, the life of a nation is for thousands of years. Temporary honor and disgrace are common in history as long as they do not affect the fundamentals. Therefore, as long as Japan sincerely seeks a solution, China only needs to demand the abandonment of territorial aggression and the return of the four northeastern provinces. Other modalities need not be rigidly adhered to. Past outstanding issues should be resolved sincerely and mutually beneficially to eliminate obstacles to diplomatic relations. The people should understand the greater good and not make unreasonable demands. The authorities should endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, demonstrating loyalty. As for expecting international turmoil to benefit China, it must be understood that Japan's victory is not China's blessing, and Japan's defeat or demise is not the blessing of China or East Asia. Currently, since Japan's breakdown of negotiations with London regarding naval reductions, it has been in a tight spot on all sides, becoming the target of public criticism, completely trapped in a state of isolation. Therefore, some people believe that because Japan has committed many unjust acts, it will eventually destroy itself, and China need not suffer temporary pain. China should rather become a rubble field like Belgium, so that Japan may follow Germany's path in the European War and suffer even greater disasters. Therefore, for China's sake, in this situation, it must persist, and should prolong Japan's arrogance to observe its weaknesses. The author believes that the meaning of humanity lies not in mutual obstruction but in coexistence. World progress should value righteousness over emotional impulses. Japan's current recklessness is akin to a madman rushing toward a well. We all see it clearly, but China, based on its inherent concept of righteousness, should only strive for survival through its own efforts, without taking advantage of others' benefits. It should be known that Japan's actions, even if they harm others, ultimately harm itself, while China should be upright, uphold justice, and save others as well as itself. If the situation allows, it should also open a path to enlightenment for Japan, without harboring malicious intentions. If Japan does not force China to perish together, China should seek survival through a path to life and not follow the wild currents to collapse together, mutually dragging each other into error. If it is said that retaining a strong enemy can motivate the people's ambition, in my opinion, as long as the people resolutely revitalize themselves with the determination to be reborn today after dying yesterday, and no longer become as undisciplined and weak as before, disrupting their own progress, they can revive even without external threats. As for still observing the international situation or harboring reliance on others after suffering lessons, it is not only unwise but also demonstrates China's lack of ambition and awareness. For example, even now, some people pay attention to Japan's attitude toward the Nine-Power Treaty and the Washington Treaty and react with joy or sorrow accordingly. However, it must be understood that if the preservation of territorial integrity and the open-door policy depend on international agreements, this is already China's great danger. The reason why the powers made these agreements is not to plan for China. On the surface, it is nothing more than maintaining equilibrium and protecting commerce, but in reality, it is the only method for imperialism to deal with semi-colonies. If China cannot revive through its own efforts and still relies on these treaties, then as the situation changes, it may be a prelude to partition or joint administration. It must be understood that Japan's current recklessness is to turn China into a protectorate, demanding hegemony, while the Western powers, regarding a China that cannot strengthen itself, envision the outcome as partition or joint administration, with the slogan of equal opportunity. From China's standpoint, whether it is exclusive or joint occupation, it is an unacceptable harm to the nation. The only way for China to plan for itself is to rely on its own strength, endure hardship, and strive for survival. It should decisively resolve current obstacles, especially the conflicts with Japan, and quickly seek to eliminate them, while not relaxing in the slightest on the essential plan for self-strengthening and self-preservation. It must be known that only when one stands up on one's own feet is there security. As for being driven by grief and anger, swayed by emotions, and echoing the slogans of the late Qing Dynasty, thinking that it is better to perish at the hands of Europe and America than at the hands of Japan, it must be understood that China is an independent country, and not an inch of its land can be destroyed by any foreign nationality. Therefore, everything else seems secondary, and the only requirement is to maintain national independence and integrity.</p>
<p>Paths to be Recognized and Adopted by Japan　What Japan should first recognize is that only with an independent China can there be an East Asia for East Asians. Therefore, the first imperative is to thoroughly support China's genuine independence, which is Japan's enduring national policy. With an independent China standing shoulder to shoulder with advanced Japan in an equal position, Japan can then make good use of its "special position and interests in East Asia" (Hirota's words), and China can also fulfill its mission to East Asia. Secondly, it should be known that times have changed, and the policies of the past are no longer applicable. To thoroughly renew Sino-Japanese relations, it should abandon military force and focus on cultural cooperation, abandon territorial aggression and replace it with mutually beneficial economic cooperation, abandon attempts at political control, and combine with China through moral and emotional bonds. Thirdly, it should be known that in the past tension in Sino-Japanese relations, if China had 40% of the responsibility, Japan should have at least 60%. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has intensified tension with international communities in order to achieve its purposes. This is due to Japan's excessive optimism about distant and unrealized ambitions, and excessive pessimism about near and feasible solutions. We believe that if the Sino-Japanese problem were quickly resolved, it could at least clear a large part of the turbulence, and the resolution of the Sino-Japanese problem only requires a swift shift in Japan's mind. If Japan can truly realize that persisting in this deadlock is not a plan for shared danger, and stop covering it up with empty words, stop fabricating various false reasons, and stop acting self-satisfied and self-justifying, it should earnestly express the sincerity of "preserving China's unity" and "absolutely not hindering China's independence or interests and not intending to harm them" (words from the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement and Hirota's talks), decisively return the four northeastern provinces, making them belong to China's territory. At the same time, it should resolve outstanding issues between China and Japan. This negotiation should, of course, be initiated by Japan, but direct negotiations between the two countries are also acceptable. After an agreement is reached, China will report to the League of Nations. The League of Nations, in order to maintain peace, will be happy to accept. At the same time, the reason for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will have been eliminated, so it should rejoin the League of Nations to eliminate the various difficult problems caused by its withdrawal from the League. In this way, the ill feelings between China and Japan can certainly disappear, and the dark clouds of war threatening the world will immediately clear. All of humanity will benefit from Japan's actions. This will not damage Japan's dignity or original stance, and on the other hand, it can avoid endless future thorns. For Japan's sake, this is the only proper national policy.</p>
<h3>VIII. Conclusion: The One Who Tied the Bell Must Untie It</h3>
<p>This article is neither a strategist's eloquent argument nor a specialist's meticulous treatise. The author is confident that it does not contain the slightest prejudice or preconception, and there are no taboos. It simply discusses the true interests of both countries, as well as the East Asian situation and world peace. What is pointed out is not some profound theory, but a kind of ordinary platitude. However, the truth of the world often lies in these ordinary principles. If the politicians of both countries have broad minds and deep insight, they should disregard everything, eliminate obstacles, and rise up to implement the path mentioned in the previous paragraph to break the current stalemate. However, this responsibility lies almost entirely with Japan, because regardless of the first half of the problem, the obstruction of all solutions is the result of Japan's refusal to accept any advice. Since then, third countries or other organizations can only stand aside, and China, being in a state of humiliation of occupied territory, has no possibility of breaking the stalemate. I believe that the Japanese should know that the thorns ahead were all created by Japan itself. If they turn back now, the flat road will appear immediately. An ancient Chinese saying goes: "The one who tied the bell must untie it," so the responsibility for breaking the deadlock must ultimately be borne by Japan.</p>
<p>In short, whether in terms of history, geography, or national relations, the relationship between China and Japan should be more than that of lips and teeth, really being nations that live and die together, coexist and perish together. Will they ultimately be enemies and perish together? Or will they restore friendship and jointly shoulder the mission of the times? This depends on whether the people and authorities of both countries, especially Japan, have the courage to recognize the facts, pull back from the precipice, and the wisdom to clear away obstacles and plan for the long term.

<p>This Year's Children's Year Expanded Publicity Campaign for Children's Day</p>
<h3>Central and Local Governments Hold Preparations Separately</h3>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association suggested to the National Child Welfare Association to request the central government to designate this year as "China Children's Year" in order to promote national children's welfare and strengthen the race. This measure is of great significance. The National Child Welfare Association and the Municipal Children's Welfare Association are organizing the "China Children's Year Preparatory Committee" in order to promote an expanded publicity campaign as the Children's Day of April 4th is fast approaching. Here is an overview of the process and implementation methods:</p>
<p>The Course of Preparations　Civilized countries in the modern world often hold Children's Years to promote children's welfare. The purpose of the Children's Year is to arouse national public attention to children's undertakings, so that everyone has the concept of loving children and bears the responsibility of loving children. At the same time, it also makes children across the country understand their own position, strive to improve, and strive to move forward. Its significance is extremely important. On November 15, 1933, the National Child Welfare Association approved the proposal of the Children's Welfare Association and submitted a request to the National Government to promote the year 1934 as Children's Year. On February 12, 1934, it was instructed by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to inform the National Government that the period of the Children's Year should be changed to 1935 due to preparatory reasons. On May 14th of last year, the association drafted an organizational outline for the Central and Local Preparatory Committees for the China Children's Year and requested the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to submit it to the Ministry of Education for review. The Ministry of Education agreed to adopt it as a reference.</p>
<p>Central Children's Year　The organizational outline for the Children's Year drafted by the association is divided into central and local categories. The work of the Central Children's Year Preparatory Committee includes: (1) publishing a China Children's Year Handbook, (2) formulating China Children's Year slogans, (3) formulating China Children's Year songs, (3) formulating China Children's Year declaration (published on New Year's Day), (5) requesting the National Government to issue a circular to all major newspapers across the country to publish a special issue on the opening of China Children's Year, (6) holding an opening ceremony for China Children's Year in the capital, (7) holding a Children's Year oath ceremony in the capital (all of the above are on New Year's Day), (8) broadcasting lectures on children's welfare issues on the radio every Sunday, (9) requesting the National Government to issue a circular to all major newspapers across the country to publish more special children's issues, (10) planning a fund for the China Child Welfare Association to build a clubhouse, (11) collecting and reviewing children's toys from all over the country, (12) collecting and reviewing children's reading materials from all over the country, (13) formulating a China Children's Day song for the Ministry of Education to reference, (14) preparing for a national children's representative audience with the Chairman of the National Government, (15) holding a national children's beauty contest, (16) holding a national children's sports meeting, (17) holding a national children's competition, (18) holding a national children's speech contest, (19) holding a national children's concert, (10) holding a national children's military equipment exhibition (21) initiating a national children's tour, (22) compiling a China Children's Year report, (23) others.</p>

<p>Universal Donation Association Allocates 100,000 to Relief</p>
<h3>50,000 for Emergency Drought Relief in Various Provinces, 50,000 for Emergency Banditry Relief in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>According to Central News Agency, since its establishment, the Urgent Relief and Donation Association has worked very hard to handle various universal donations, and has received a total of more than 100,000 donations, which has been reported in various newspapers. Since the severe cold has arrived and the disaster victims in various places are in urgent need of assistance, according to the resolution of the second meeting of the association, equal importance will be attached to emergency relief for banditry and drought disasters. A special allocation of 100,000 will be made to the Drought Relief Association of various provinces, with 50,000 for emergency drought relief in various provinces and 50,000 specifically for emergency banditry relief in Jiangxi, and a letter will be sent to the Drought Relief Association of various provinces to be responsible for handling the relief.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Bank received donations from workers, including 256.82 yuan from the Sixth Factory of Shenxin Textile and 72 yuan from Minsheng Rubber Factory. The Universal Urgent Relief Donation Association also received 50 yuan from the Electrical Industry Association.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Develops Telephone Plan</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Service in Nine Provinces</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Communications plans to install long-distance telephone service in nine provinces to facilitate domestic communication. Chen Gengfa, the Chief Engineer of the Shanghai-Hankou Line, has been dispatched to Hankou to survey the route from Hankou to Qiupu, and Li Guohua, the Chief Engineer of the Qinghu Line, has been dispatched to survey the route from Qiupu to Nanjing. It is learned that the two gentlemen, Chen and Li, have completed the route survey and are now proceeding to the second step of surveying. As soon as the survey is completed, they will begin erecting poles and stringing wires. It is estimated that the construction of the project can begin at the beginning of next month. The Jinghan Line is expected to be completed and open to communication in six months. The full completion of communication in all nine provinces will not be possible until two years later at the earliest. However, the Ministry of Communications believes that the construction of long-distance telephones in various provinces and the establishment of wireless telephones require a large amount of money, which is difficult to raise in a short period of time. It has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to allocate 800,000 yuan for application. It is learned that the funding has been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting to be drawn from the second item of national reserve funds, and it has been approved for implementation by the Central Political Conference. Therefore, the construction plan for long-distance telephone service in nine provinces can proceed step by step.</p>
<h3>National Wireless Telephone Service</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, in order to develop the domestic wireless radio business, the Ministry of Communications purchased wireless radio parts and materials in the United Kingdom last year with the Boxer Indemnity funds allocated by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Association. It designated Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, and Beiping as the first five places to install telephone service. Since the parts and materials were purchased and returned to China, the Ministry ordered the Zhenru International Wireless Radio Station to set up a general station. At the end of last year, it conducted several test calls with the aforementioned locations, and the sound was clear and there was no obstruction of radio waves. The station's situation in Shanghai is reported and broadcast daily. According to news from the station, the Ministry of Communications is currently planning to expand the installation in major cities across the country. After March, it plans to develop overseas and establish wireless radio station communication internationally.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Envoys Prepare to Return to Office</p>
<h3>The Ministers of the United States, Soviet Russia, and Czechoslovakia Will All Return to China, and Our Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, and Others Are Also Preparing to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>According to Shi Shi News Agency, the severe winter is coming to an end and spring is beginning to bloom. The foreign envoys to China who are on leave are all about to return to their posts one after another. Our ambassadors Yan Huiqing and Gu Weijun to France are also preparing to return to their posts abroad. Yesterday, the reporter of Shen Shi News Agency specifically learned the actions of various important foreign envoys as follows:</p>
<h3>Foreign Envoys Return to Office One After Another</h3>
<p>According to inquiries from various related parties, the foreign envoys to China who are on their way back to China include the American Minister to China, Mr. Johnson, who boarded an American ship in San Francisco on the 24th of this month to return to his post in China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 10th of next month. In addition, the first Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov, requested a four-month leave in October of last year to return home and consult with the government on Sino-Russian diplomatic issues. With the vacation about to expire, according to news from the Russian Embassy, the Russian Ambassador will be able to return to his post in the shortest possible time. The Czech Minister to China, Mr. Feige, and his wife left China for several months to return to their home country. The matter has now been completed. Mr. Feige departed from the Czech Republic on a British mail ship in the first ten days of this month and is expected to arrive here in early next month.</p>
<h3>Yan and Gu to Leave the Country</h3>
<p>Yan Huiqing, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Gu Weijun, the envoy to France, both high-ranking diplomats stationed abroad who had requested leave to stay in the country, are scheduled to return to their posts. Mr. Yan originally intended to resign due to his age, but the government, recognizing the need for experienced and respected diplomatic personnel during this time of national crisis, persuaded him to continue in his role. He has already traveled from Tianjin to Beijing to meet with Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek for instructions on diplomatic policy before departing for Russia. Envoy to France, Gu Weijun, and the newly appointed envoy to Turkey, He Yaozu, are also scheduled to leave the country within the next month to manage diplomatic affairs. Zhang Naiyan, the envoy to Belgium, will also return to his post after his leave ends.</p>
<p>Consul in Houston Reports Tung Oil to Be Phased Out</p>
<h3>Countries Compete to Plant Tung Trees</h3>
<p>Tung oil is a unique product of China and an important raw material for the paint industry. In recent years, it has occupied an important position in export trade. In order to achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials, various countries are planting tung trees, with the United States being particularly diligent. When the time is right, China's tung oil industry will inevitably be naturally eliminated. The International Trade Bureau recently received a report from the Consul in Houston regarding overseas tung tree planting, excerpts of which are as follows: Tung oil was first imported into the United States as far back as 1869. At that time, the American Consul General in Hankou explained the value and uses of tung oil, and the United States government began to pay special attention. As a result, the Department of Agriculture, the Paint Industry Association, various university agricultural colleges, the Tung Oil Association, and others actively conducted research. Since 1902, tung seeds have been continuously shipped to various provinces in the United States for widespread planting. Publications on tung tree planting are frequently published. According to statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the area planted with tung trees in various provinces has reached more than 44,000 acres. The Ford Motor Company, considering tung oil essential for automobiles and airplanes, has opened a 200-acre tung tree planting farm to collect seeds and press oil themselves, eliminating the need to purchase from China. England, France, Germany, and other countries have also made efforts, but with little effect. After the United States successfully tested planting, various countries followed suit. China has been actively purchasing tung seeds from the United States and the UK, with the United Kingdom being particularly enthusiastic. In 1927, the Oil Affairs Advisory Committee of the British Royal Society cooperated with paint industrialists to purchase tung seeds from the United States for planting in various colonies. According to recent reports, Australia, New Zealand, India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, the Union of South Africa, Sudan, the West Indies, Honduras, and other British territories have all achieved good results, and the future is immeasurable. In addition, Argentina has planted 50,000 tung trees, Paraguay 30,000, and Russia has planted 900 acres. Currently, there are plans to plant 36,000 acres in 1937. Other countries, such as Italy, Central and South American countries, the Dutch East Indies, and the Belgian Congo and Morocco in East Africa, have purchased large quantities of tung seeds from the United States for trial planting.</p>
<h3>Merchant Mariners General Assembly Submits a Request to the Ministry to Implement Seafarer Insurance</h3>
<p>The issue of seafarer insurance was previously raised by Shanghai shipping merchants, who advocated that all sailors, stokers, and others on ships be insured for life and accident, so that in the event of a maritime accident, the compensation could be used as part of the support. However, this matter has not yet been realized. The Merchant Marine Drivers Association has submitted a request to the Ministry of Commerce, requesting implementation. The original submission is as follows:</p>
<p>Submission regarding the dangers of seafarer life, requesting that all shipping companies be ordered to uniformly insure seafarers' lives and accidents to prevent unforeseen circumstances and provide for subsequent arrangements. It is noted that seafaring is inherently dangerous and cannot be compared to the safety of other occupations. Those who engage in this profession struggle daily against relentless storms and waves, and collisions and accidents are ever-present dangers. Maritime disasters and losses are thus specific terms. In recent years, maritime accidents have been frequent, and shipwrecks are often heard of. For example, the recent sinking of the Taishan Tongfu ship resulted in no survivors among the crew, causing grief to all who heard of it. However, the dead are gone, and what about the living? If good methods are not devised to provide security, then seafarers will view seafaring with trepidation. Although the Maritime Commerce Law has provisions for seafarers who die in the line of duty, shipowners often go bankrupt due to the sinking of the ship, making them unable to provide support, or they are uncharitable in their hearts and make various excuses, causing the bereaved families to run around appealing, which is truly pitiful. The disputes over the Tongfu ship today are a clear example. It is noted that among the Chinese insurance companies currently in China, there are those who underwrite seafarer life and accident insurance. The premium per ship per year is only a few hundred yuan. In the event of an accident, compensation can be received for support. For shipowners, the burden is very light, avoiding liability, and for families, funds can be obtained immediately for subsequent arrangements. This is truly a good policy that benefits both parties. It is therefore urgently submitted, requesting that all shipping companies be ordered to uniformly insure seafarers' lives and accidents to prevent unforeseen circumstances and provide for subsequent arrangements, which would truly be a benefit. Respectfully submitted, etc.</p>
<h3>Sharp Fall in Japanese Currency</h3>
<p>One Hundred Chinese Dollars Can Be Exchanged for One Hundred Twenty-Nine Yuan and Fifty Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Japanese gold market had been gradually changing its tone for several days. On the 28th, it suddenly plummeted. One hundred Chinese silver dollars could be exchanged for one hundred twenty-nine yuan and fifty fen in Japanese currency, and the trend is continuing. Other exchange rates against the British pound and the US dollar have also weakened successively. This is due to the year-end settlement of accounts for the Lunar New Year, which requires a large amount of cash, and the settlement of the Sino-Soviet Railway negotiations, the payment of compensation, and the repayment of the British goods debentures of the South Manchuria Railway, which have contributed to this. Based on the current situation, it is speculated that the Japanese currency may fall to 150 yuan, which is not impossible.</p>
<h3>China International Trade Association Hires Honorary Representatives Abroad</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the China International Trade Association, in order to understand the supply and demand situation in foreign markets and to seek to communicate with overseas Chinese, previously sent letters to various embassies and consulates abroad, asking them to select one person from among the wealthy and interested in trade as an honorary representative of the association. It is now learned that the association has received recommendations from the following embassies and consulates, which have been reviewed and approved by the board of directors. Appointment letters will be issued soon. The list is as follows: Location, Name, Qualification</p>

<p>Hou Shinian's Collection of Seals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Will is Published</p>
<h3>Finely Printed and Distributed by the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Collection of Seals of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Will is composed of twenty-five sentences from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, each sentence forming a seal. Each seal is made in a different style according to the meaning of the sentence, and the carving methods are carefully avoided from being the same. In addition to conforming to the Qin and Han dynasties, it also takes inspiration from bells, tripods, coins, and roof tiles. There are also inscriptions by more than twenty gentlemen, including Wu Zhihui, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Tan Zekai, Xu Beihong, and Wang Yiting. It is not only praised as a masterpiece of modern seal carving and can serve as a model for beginners, but it is also the first work of art from the Party and the country's literature, most suitable for decorating living rooms. It has been made into metal plates by the Shanghai Commercial Press, mounted into artistic four-foot scrolls, and officially distributed by branches in various places. It is reported that Comrade Hou Shinian, the author, is currently working in the Central Party Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Inter-customs Remittance to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the matter of inter-customs remittance has not been realized at the same time as the postal service due to the complexity of the procedures. It is now learned that the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has been actively preparing, and all procedures have been completed. Therefore, from tomorrow onwards, postal savings bureaus in various places will be ordered to start accepting remittances to the Northeast, and all remittance procedures will be the same as in the past.</p>

It is confirmed that for triplicate invoices in the form of bound books used by stores, as long as the copy given to the customer is stamped with sufficient stamps as required, the remaining two copies and the cover need not be stamped again. This was previously reviewed and approved in September of the 19th year of the Republic of China based on an inquiry from the China Bookstore and has been circulated as a record. Please be informed."

<h3>To Ensure Accuracy and Maintain Public Trust</h3>
<p>The Dagong News reports that the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee yesterday issued an order to all public organizations, stating: "To ensure compliance, it is found that public organizations in this city often do not keep accurate records of income and expenditure, and they are not sincerely open to the public. Leaders may even abuse their authority at will. Once reported, they often make excuses and evade responsibility, resulting in numerous disputes.

<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade Builds Largest Pump Fire Truck</p>
<h3>Completion Ceremony Scheduled for Mid-Next Month, Hosted by Mayor Wu, Inviting Guests from All Walks of Life to Visit</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade has recently built two of the latest and most complete large pump fire trucks. The completion ceremony is scheduled for mid-next month, hosted by Mayor Wu. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Largest Pump</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in view of the importance of fire prevention in this city where Chinese and foreigners live together, has made great efforts in recent years to improve and reorganize the Municipal Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade. Recently, the brigade has built two of the latest and most complete fire trucks. These fire trucks are the largest in Shanghai, weighing four and a half tons. All materials, except for the engine, which is a Damon-Tianma motor, are entirely made of domestic materials. The price of each truck is more than ten thousand yuan. If these largest pump trucks were ordered from abroad, each would cost more than sixty thousand yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Completion</h3>
<p>Currently, the trucks are being actively built. Most of the parts for one truck have been assembled and will be fully completed by mid-next month. At that time, Mayor Wu will host the completion ceremony, inviting senior officials from the concession fire brigade and guests from all walks of life to visit. This pump will be assigned to the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, as it is located near Chinese and foreign areas with many factories. The Zhabei, Ximen, and Nanshi fire brigades have sufficient strength and are able to cope with fires. Therefore, the current work of the fire brigade is to actively expand to rural areas, such as the Yangjing and Gaoqiao sections of Pudong, where new equipment is planned to be added.</p>

<p>Part of the Workers at the Seeking New Machine Shipbuilding Plant Strike Yesterday</p>
<h3>Because the Request to Reinstate Three Dismissed Workers Was Ineffective</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News reports that more than 300 workers are employed at the Seeking New Machine Shipbuilding Plant on Jichang Street in Nanshi. On the 26th of this month, the plant manager (McTileo) dismissed three apprentices, No. 849, No. 844, etc., which caused opposition from more than 80 workers. At 8 a.m. yesterday, the workers requested the manager to reinstate the dismissed workers, but to no avail. They first went on strike, then formally announced a strike. The Shipbuilding Industry Association of the First District of this city was notified and immediately sent Director Wu Qiulin to negotiate with the plant manager and the second-in-command, but was also rejected. The workers then gathered at the Shipbuilding Industry Association of the First District yesterday to discuss solutions. A resolution was passed to propose three conditions: (1) immediately reinstate the dismissed workers, (2) pay wages as usual during the strike, and (3) do not dismiss workers without reason in the future. At the same time, the circumstances of the strike were submitted to the municipal party and government agencies and the General Labor Union, requesting assistance. It is also heard that after receiving the news, the Municipal Public Security Bureau specially sent four policemen to the plant yesterday to protect it, in order to avoid incidents.</p>
<p>A Foreman Driven to Death a Mid-cabin Worker</p>
<h3>Maritime Groups Unite in Donation and Request That Maritime Party and Labor Unions Negotiate Punishment and Compensation</h3>
<p>Tong Tianhou, a mid-cabin worker on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Longhe wheel, was forced by the Xianghe wheel's Western ticket inspector Niumen to jump into the river and drown. When the shocking news came, the Maritime Association, the South Jun'an Water Fair Association, the Yan Ying General Society, the Yan Ying South Society, the Maritime Helmsmen Carpenters Mutual Aid Association, the Sanbei Hongan Stevedores Club, and other maritime groups all felt deeply saddened. They jointly telegraphed maritime branches and maritime groups in various places to provide assistance and requested that the Chinese Maritime Special Party Department and the Chinese Seamen's Union negotiate sternly. The original telegram is recorded below (titles omitted): "This time, Tong Tianhou, a mid-cabin worker on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Longhe wheel, was beaten and humiliated by the Xianghe wheel's Western ticket inspector Niumen and died by jumping into the river. Upon hearing the news, we are all saddened and are willing to unite in assistance. We also hope that the Maritime Party and Labor Unions will send staff to negotiate sternly and achieve the goal of dismissing and punishing the Niumen and providing generous compensation to the deceased. The Maritime Association (etc.) respectfully."</p>
<h3>Improvements in Training of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>Colonel Grier, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Shanghai International Settlement, has submitted his report for the past year to the Municipal Council. In it, he considers the prior announcement of inspections of various units to be inappropriate. He proposes inviting the British military commander to inspect the team at any time so that the training can be effectively recognized. Also, past overall inspections have been too formal and of little military value, and should be changed to a column-style march.</p>
<p>Increased Use of Officers In the past, the Corps was only an organization of one battalion, which was extremely inconvenient for training. Now, one quartermaster officer and one battalion officer have been added. In addition, one advisor should be appointed for the Russian battalion (already approved) and two adjutants (one already approved). According to the new organization, there is one cavalry regiment, one artillery team, one special team, and three infantry battalions. The first and second battalions are volunteer members, and the third battalion is Russian members.</p>
<p>Rectification of Firearms Commander Grier advocates that a European and American ordnance specialist should be hired to be responsible for repairing ordnance and supervising workers. The appointment of this person is currently under consideration by the board of directors. Additional Barracks The new house built on top of the garage will be completed soon. In peacetime, it can be used as a dedicated training room for each team and group. In times of mobilization, it can provide accommodation for 350 members. The quartermaster's storage room and courier room have also been completed. The Corps Club has also been rebuilt.</p>
<p>Training Needs The commander pays close attention to whether the training is effective. The roads in the settlement are too narrow, so in practice, it is mostly theoretical explanations. Defensive and flatland warfare must undergo the same training without distinction. Therefore, there must be long-term personnel in charge of this matter. Last year, personnel from the British Army and the US Navy were borrowed to serve as firearm combat instructors for 15 nights. 150 officers were trained, and most were able to pass on what they had learned to the members they commanded. The results were quite satisfactory. Infantry is the backbone of the military, but its training is more monotonous and difficult. Therefore, it is urgent to add one formal military battalion commander to each of the first and second battalions so that the training can be effective.</p>
<p>Target Practice Last year's target practice results were generally satisfactory. However, during target practice, there was a lack of experienced instructors to point out mistakes at any time. Therefore, there were often repeated misses, which led to discouragement. After the establishment of a manager in the target range, a lot of waste was saved. The targets are now made of waste materials by carpenters. The light artillery team, with the kindness of the British military commander, went to Hong Kong on a British warship last year to practice live-fire shooting. However, the team's cannons are too old, and ammunition cannot be purchased. Replacements are needed within two years. It is best to replace them with the British-style three-inch white cannons, which are not expensive, easy to train with, and most suitable for application.</p>
<p>Recruitment Difficulties Currently, there is a shortage of about 100 British and American members in the first and second battalions. Commander Grier's intention is that it is best to train a smaller number of members who can be mobilized in times of small emergencies and at the same time prepare several groups of trained reserves who will not be called up until commerce is completely at a standstill. In this way, both corps affairs and commerce can be taken care of.</p>

<h3>Shanghai South Cold Shelter Appeals to Various Charity Groups for Relief Assistance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Cold Shelter in the Nanshi area has seen a dramatic increase in the number of impoverished people admitted recently, requiring 25 piculs of rice daily. Funds are insufficient, and with the increasingly cold weather, the impoverished people are suffering from hunger and cold, making it difficult to cope. Therefore, yesterday, letters were sent to the Chinese Red Cross and various charitable organizations, requesting assistance and relief. The letter stated: "Our shelter annually admits a large number of impoverished people in each season. This year, we are still setting up shelters in the Chaozhou Guild Hall at the South Railway Station and a second shelter in the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road. Since the shelter started on December 1st of last year, we have admitted more than 2,800 impoverished people in the two locations, requiring approximately 25 piculs of rice daily. However, our shelter has no fixed funds and relies entirely on fundraising for support. We are grateful to your association for donating (rice) (cotton clothing and bedding) (donations) to relieve the poor. Your enthusiasm is admirable. However, with the weather becoming increasingly cold, the number of impoverished people seeking shelter has been increasing daily, suffering from hunger and cold, which is a dire situation. Previously, our chairman, Mr. Wang Yiting, discussed with your association about granting assistance, etc. We are now writing again, earnestly hoping that you will consider the plight of the poor and generously donate assistance. The merit of such an act is immeasurable. We have repeatedly requested assistance and hope for your understanding." It is reported that yesterday, Ms. Sheng sent all 265 of the cotton quilts and mattresses raised for the Women's Wounded Soldiers Hospital to the Renji Charity Hall on Liu Ma Road, and the association transferred them for relief. In addition, the Drought Relief Association of various provinces also donated 1,437 sets of old uniforms, and Mr. Jiang Mingbiao donated 2,100 anti-smoking pills.</p>
<p>Health and Social Bureaus Ban Tooth Protection Association</p>
<h3>Ordered the Association to Cease Operations Immediately, Joint Letter to the Municipal Party Department for Reference</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, a Tooth Protection Association was discovered in the city last year. Its organizational content was not very legal, and the health authorities ordered it to correct this. As the association still has some non-compliant aspects, the Health Bureau, together with the Social Bureau, has banned it and sent a letter to the Municipal Party Department for reference. The original letter is extracted below: "After investigation, the China Age Tooth Protection Association has neither applied for permission to establish itself in accordance with the regulations on supervising social organizations in this city, nor has it complied with the instructions of this Health Bureau: (1) The medical part of the association should be permanently responsible for dentures by a formal dentist, and Ying Yongfeng should not impersonate a dentist or doctor. (2) Dentists who have not been approved and registered by this city shall not be employed. (3) All promotional advertisements of the association shall not contain false or exaggerated information, etc. According to recent investigations, the former employed dentist Lin Qingping has long since resigned, and the medical part is, in fact, still unauthorizedly diagnosed by denture maker Ying Yongfeng. In addition to arbitrarily publishing false and exaggerated advertisements in various newspapers, the association also produces special publications in the News Evening Post, doing its best to make false deceptions. All of these are in stark contrast to the three restrictions previously opened by this Health Bureau. Furthermore, the membership fees stipulated in the association's charter are as high as hundreds of dollars per person. Since the association has not obtained legal person status in accordance with the law and official instructions, nor is it an approved formal commercial savings institution or commercial insurance institution, the huge amount of public funds collected has not been found to have detailed safekeeping measures, and the interests of members are virtually unprotected. It seems that this is close to cheating and defrauding money, and it should be strictly banned. In addition to ordering the association to immediately stop activities and separately report the completion for approval, it must not be delayed and held accountable. The corresponding letter is hereby sent for reference to the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality."</p>
<h3>Kenyee Bank's Avenue Joffre Branch Issues New Spring Savings Certificates</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Avenue Joffre branch of the China Kenyee Bank has been wholeheartedly serving customers and not avoiding trivialities, which is quite convenient for citizens in the western part of the French Concession. Now it has created a kind of New Year savings certificate. The amount can be filled in from one yuan up. The style is exquisite and very easy to carry. During the New Year, it is used to replace cash, given to children as lucky money or to servants as tea money, to avoid indulging in gambling, becoming accustomed to waste, and guiding them to frugality and saving. Its benefit to society should not be small.</p>
<p>Ningbo Boat Filled with Smuggled Salt Under Huangsha</p>
<h3>Water Patrol Team Discovers the Situation, Detains Yu Caiwu and Wei Guoying</h3>
<p>At about 2:00 PM yesterday, Li Wenhan, a patrol officer of the 4th Squad of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led several police officers on a patrol of the Jiangwan Yunzaobang Pudong area. They spotted a Ningbo boat, Municipal Photo No. 8602, fully loaded with burlap bags, speeding towards them. However, when the crew of the boat saw the patrol boat approaching, their expressions suddenly became flustered and suspicious. They immediately jumped onto the boat. Under search, it was found that the burlap bags carried on the boat had sand on the top few bags, but the bottom ones were all smuggled salt, the value of which was very large. Therefore, the crew of the boat, Yu Caiwu, and Wei Guoying from Pudong, were detained and taken back to the team along with the evidence. Under strict interrogation, Yu Caiwu confessed that he was 35 years old and from Pudong. The burlap bags were shipped from Dinghai, Ningbo, and were intended to be unloaded in Yangshupu. The ship owner, Yu Afa, contracted for the shipment. They only knew that it contained yellow sand and did not know that a large amount of smuggled salt was secretly hidden inside. He asked for leniency, etc. Wei Guoying confessed that he was 64 years old and had been working in the Xiangyuanfeng Rice Shop in Songjiang. This time, he escorted 400 dan of rice to the Baotongchang Rice Shop in Dinghai, Ningbo. Later, because the boat came to Shanghai, he took the opportunity to hitch a ride but did not know that there were illegal activities on the boat, etc. The team was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the headquarters for review.</p>

<p>Shanghai's Real Estate Industry Extremely Depressed Under the Cloud of Economic Recession</p>
<h3>Prices Plummet, Transactions Stagnate</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Shanghai is the only major commercial port in China and a well-known commercial port in the world. The market is prosperous, and the population is large. The total value of real estate in the city was estimated to be approximately 200 million yuan in national currency last year. Now, affected by the market recession, the real estate industry is extremely depressed, prices have plummeted, and transactions have completely stagnated. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from real estate merchants that the main reason for the decline of the real estate industry is the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the impact on shops, resulting in a sharp drop in land prices. All real estate merchants are unwilling to sell, resulting in stagnant transactions. For example, recently, a certain piece of land with a total of two mu on the eastern end of Nanking Road, Huilo Company, which belongs to foreigners, wanted to sell it, asking for 1.5 million taels. However, the foreigners who intended to buy it initially offered 950,000 yuan and finally 1 million yuan, resulting in no deal. However, the asking price of 1.5 million taels is not too high. Based on this, the decline of Shanghai real estate can be imagined. The eastern part of the Public Concession is a factory area, the western part is a residential area, and the central part is a business area. Real estate transactions used to be quite frequent, so it has a great relationship with the entire finance and can affect various industries. Now that real estate transactions have stagnated, the impact is not small, but it is expected that it will not be difficult to recover in the future.</p>
<p>Public Works Department Raises Roads to Prevent Huangpu River High Tide</p>
<h3>Dredging Bureau Announced Tide Times Yesterday, Warehouses Along the River Prepared</h3>
<p>The Dredging Bureau announced last week that the Huangpu River would have a high tide on the 4th and 5th of next month, and low-lying areas might be flooded. Now, the Engineering Department of the Public Concession Bureau has raised the roads at the request of merchants along the river (from the Jiujiang Road intersection to the Guangdong Road intersection) to prevent flooding. Warehouses on both sides of the river are also preparing in advance. Yesterday, a reporter from the Industry and Commerce News Agency learned about the situation and recorded it below.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Raises Roads</h3>
<p>The area along the river from the Jiujiang Road intersection to the Guangdong Road intersection (east of Sichuan Road) has always been very low-lying. Whenever a high tide occurs, households along the road are at risk of being flooded, and the impact on the bank vaults is even greater. The Engineering Department of the Public Concession Bureau has raised the roads by eight inches to three feet to prevent flooding. Those that have already been raised include the Four Banks Preparatory Vault, the Telephone Bureau, Mitsui &amp; Co., J. L. Morrison &amp; Co., the Jianghai Customs, the Continental Bank, the East Asia Bank, the Bank of China (new location), the China &amp; South Sea Bank, HSBC, and more than ten other locations. Those that have not yet been completed include the Exchange Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, Citibank, Mitsui Bank, Chase Bank, and Mobil Oil, about ten locations. According to reporters from the Engineering Department, the roads that have been raised must be completed within three or four days.</p>
<h3>Tide Times and Heights</h3>
<p>The reporter interviewed Mr. Chadley, Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau yesterday. According to him, the high tide will definitely occur as scheduled. (1) February 4 (i.e., the Lunar New Year's Day): The tide will rise from 11:49 AM and become stronger from 12:44 PM. The current speed will reach 2.0 nautical miles per hour. By 1:19 PM, it will have reached its highest point, reaching 10 feet and 6.4 inches. (2) February 5 (i.e., the Beginning of Spring Festival): The high tide will occur from 11:39 AM and become stronger from 1:21 PM. The current speed will reach 2.2 nautical miles per hour. By 1:57 PM, it will have reached its highest point, reaching 10 feet and 1.8 inches. During the high tides on these two days, if there is wind surge, the tide may backflow from the sewers and flood the roads in particularly low-lying areas of the port.</p>
<h3>Warehouses Along the River Prepare</h3>
<p>The warehouses on both sides of the Huangpu River have specially raised the bottom feet of the stored goods in advance to prevent water immersion due to the high tides on those two days. The warehouses have also sent letters to the customers to pick up the goods that should be picked up as soon as possible, otherwise, they will not be responsible for the damage caused by water immersion. According to reporters, the warehouses that have been raised include Dada, Ningshao, Qichang, etc., and the warehouses along the river in Hongkou.</p>
<p>Continuous Heavy Frost, Still Warm Weather in the City</p>
<h3>Agricultural Pests Will Prolong Their Lives</h3>
<p>There has been continuous heavy frost and still warm weather in the port recently. According to observations by astronomers, this phenomenon is rare in recent years. This climate is partly caused by the severe cold in the Americas and other places. Around spring, all parts of China will also turn to severe cold, and there is a risk of so-called "spring cold." Geographers speculate that the lack of three inches of snow during this cold season will cause a lot of hindrance to crops because the weather is too warm and pests can prolong their lives. During this period, farmers should loosen the soil to compensate for the lack of good weather.</p>
<p>China Kunlun Tobacco Company Announced Liquidation Yesterday Morning</p>
<h3>The Reason is that the Market is in Recession and There are Daily Losses</h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, China Kunlun Tobacco Co., Ltd. at No. 43, Ou Jia Road, (not Kunlun Tobacco Company on Huacheng Road) was founded in the 20th year of the Republic of China and was established with joint investment from shareholders. The capital was 20 yuan per share, a total of 1,500 shares, and the actual amount received was 30,000 yuan. The manager was Yu Kunshan. It produced various cigarettes such as Hao Shi, Da Halo, Xiao Halo, and Bee Butterfly. The sales in the market were still good, and it was thriving for a while. Recently, due to the impact of the market recession, the released accounts were difficult to collect, the capital was limited, and the turnover was inflexible. They had to stop business yesterday morning and hire Zhao Zuwei, Lu Dingming, lawyers and accountants to announce liquidation. Afterwards, according to reporters from Huadong News Agency, the company's losses were not much, and it is expected to return 60-70% to creditors. As for the completion of the liquidation, it will have to wait until the Lunar New Year next spring. The announcement issued by Zhao Zuwei Lawyer and Lu Dingming Accountant is recorded as follows: According to the board of directors of China Kunlun Tobacco Co., Ltd., the company is suffering from daily losses due to the impact of the market recession, which is difficult to maintain. It has no choice but to entrust representatives to announce the liquidation of the current accounts. In addition to being entrusted by this lawyer, etc., a joint representative notice is hereby issued: Anyone who owes the company or the company owes money is requested to come to register and pay separately within fourteen days of the newspaper publication. Overdue will not be dealt with. Creditors will be regarded as giving up on their own, and debtors will have to be prosecuted. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Limarou Tram New Track Completed, Traffic Started Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Huashang Electric Company specially laid tram tracks on Li Ma Road to facilitate transportation in southern Shanghai.

<p>Yesterday Afternoon, Haiyan Ship Collided with Civilian Boat in Front of the New Customs</p>
<h3>Boatman Fell into the Water and Rescued by Sampan, Sailboat Destroyed and Stranded in Pudong, Hwa-An Import Almost Collided</h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wenzhou liner Haiyan caused an accident in the Huangpu River yesterday, damaging a civilian boat. When the ship turned around, it almost collided with the Hwa-An, resulting in a disaster. The situation is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>Advance to Wenzhou</h3>
<p>The Haiyan was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Wenzhou today. However, because the ship was scheduled to depart on the Lunar New Year's Day, the company temporarily advanced the departure by one day, so it departed for Wenzhou at noon yesterday. Passengers taking this ship to Wenzhou were full, and more than 80 male and female actors, including Xiao Sanmazi, who were going to Wenzhou to perform, also set off on the Haiyan. At 11:45 yesterday, it weighed anchor and set sail from the Jinliyuan Wharf. Unexpectedly, it collided with a civilian boat in front of the New Customs Wharf.</p>
<h3>Collision with Civilian Boat</h3>
<p>When the Haiyan was sailing in the river in front of the Customs, a civilian boat was sailing from north to south. When it approached, the Haiyan pulled its whistle to order the boat to give way. However, due to the high wind and rapid tide, the civilian boat wanted to turn around but could not. Seeing this situation, the captain of the Haiyan wanted to turn aside, but there were other ships on the river. If he did not give way, the civilian boat would be broken into two pieces. He had no choice but to stop and retreat slightly, and the stern of the civilian boat slightly collided with the bow of the Haiyan, which was damaged. The boat was flooded, and the boat was about to sink. The boatman at the stern fell into the Huangpu River, and the goods in the boat were also scattered in the river.</p>
<h3>Stop to Help Rescue</h3>
<p>At the time of the accident, it was exactly 12:10. The Haiyan immediately stopped and anchored in the river to rescue the boatman who had fallen into the water. Immediately, a sampan threw a lifebuoy and dragged the boatman, but it could not be pulled into the sampan for a while. Later, another sailboat pulled up the boatman who had fallen into the water and rescued him into the boat. The damaged civilian boat was towed by a small fire boat of the water patrol police station to the shore of Pudong and grounded on the beach to avoid sinking. The rescued boatman was sent to the water patrol police station. The loss of the floating goods in the river is not yet known. The civilian boat has reported to the water patrol police station.</p>
<h3>Turn Around and Export</h3>
<p>At 12:30, the Haiyan weighed anchor and turned around, intending to turn to Lujiazui and export from the Wusongkou. However, the hull was close to the shore of Pudong, and the bottom was blocked by the shallow shore and could not move. The Haiyan reversed and retreated, lying across the river in front of the New Customs. At this time, Zhi Da and Da Yu passed by one after another. The third ship was the Hwa-An of the Chang-An Company, which imported. When it arrived in front of the New Customs, it was blocked by the Haiyan. The two ships were close to each other, and those who saw it were in danger. The Haiyan urgently raised the ball to block the Hwa-An from advancing slowly, and the captain of the Hwa-An immediately stopped and urgently threw double anchors to stop the hull, and the distance was barely a hair's breadth. The Hwa-An hung the yellow flag to import because there were sick passengers in the ship. The doctor ship of the harbor inspection office went to test it when it anchored.</p>
<p>After the Failure of Jiande Bank, Chai Chuangui, Li Jingwei, etc. Were Charged</p>
<h3>Wang Ruyao and Others Added Charges Against Chai, Li, etc. for Fraud, Li Jingwei Still Said That the Debts Owed by Others Could Be Compensated</h3>
<p>丨Li Jingwei Was Exempted from Bail Because He Worked at the Railway Bureau丨</p>
<p>After the failure of Jiande Bank, Wei Haijiang, who runs real estate, originally had transactions with the bank. The general manager, Chai Chuangui, knew that Wei was very rich, so he sent the deputy manager, Gu Wensheng, to be a lobbyist last summer to persuade Wei to invest. By November, he used the position of deputy manager as bait to trick Wei into obtaining the security list. When Jiande failed, Wei understood the inside story and sued Chai Chuangui and the known chairman, directors, and supervisors of the bank to the First Special District Court, asking to punish those who</p>
<h3>Fraud and Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Betrayal and other crimes. The previous hearing had three defendants, Chai Chuangui, Xie Keming, and Li Jingwei, to the case. Under the questioning of the judge of the primary criminal court, because the defendants were suspected of embezzlement in business, the defendants were ordered to be transferred to the local court for trial. This ruling obviously increased the criminal responsibility of the defendants. Chai, etc., knew this, and the person in charge of the bank, feeling that the economic strength was weakening and the foundation was shaken, then specialized in defrauding funds from various parties. Therefore, if Wei Haijiang was deceived in the same way or hired as deputy manager or manager,</p>
<h3>Loss of Huge Amounts of Money</h3>
<p>There are still a large number of people. Now that Wei has filed a lawsuit, all those who have suffered losses as a result will follow in Wei's footsteps. Yesterday afternoon, when Liu Yugui continued to hear the case filed by Wei, Wang Ruyao and others jointly hired Chen Tingrui as a lawyer to join the plaintiff's ranks. However, in addition to the same defendants as Wei's, several names, including Ou Jiancheng, the general manager of Yong'an Bank, which had suspended business twice, were added. It turned out that Ou, etc., were also directors of Jiande, but Wei Haijiang</p>
<h3>Investigation</h3>
<p>Therefore, they were omitted. However, since the defendants understood that the responsibility was increased before and heard that they were additionally charged later, they did not dare to turn themselves in. Only one supervisor, Li Jingwei, was present in court. The rest, such as Chai Chuangui and Xie Keming, were away from Shanghai on business, Chen Xifu lived in Hangzhou, Yan Ziyu, Ma Suizhi, Tu Kaizheng, and Chai Yousheng all claimed to be ill. Their defense lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Hong Shihao, all requested that the case be adjourned. Judge Liu has already understood that the defendants were just making excuses and told the lawyers to convey to their clients that if they still failed to appear in court next time, they would be dealt with according to law. As the plaintiff</p>
<h3>All Have Been Reported</h3>
<p>Decided to ask about the facts first, and then summoned Wei Haijiang to ask about the points he sued. According to Wei, the amount of fraud sued was 5,000 yuan. In June last year, Chai Chuangui asked Gu Wensheng to persuade me to invest, saying that the bank had collected a share capital of 500,000 and was now increasing it by another 500,000. So, I bought 50 shares. It was not until after the closure that I learned that there was no new share recruitment. There are two acts of embezzlement: (1) In April last year, I handed over three land deeds to the bank as security for an overdraft of 10,000 yuan. By October, I had paid off the overdraft and returned the deeds, according to Chai, who said that it had been re-pledged to</p>
<h3>Zhixiang Money Shop</h3>
<p>Promising to redeem it in a short period of time. Although it was redeemed on December 3, it was re-pledged to the Four Banks Savings Society, and the pledged funds were increased from 20,000 to 60,000. (2) In October, Chai sent Gu again to ask me to be the deputy manager and hand over the Fang Dan of 110 mu in Beixin Jing as security. Unexpectedly, it was also privately pledged to the Shanghai Bank for 60,000 yuan. I went to the bank for a day and there was nothing to do, so I didn't go there again. However, the letter of appointment as deputy manager has not been seen yet. As for the so-called breach of faith, I have signed a contract with</p>
<h3>Overdraft of Ten Thousand Gold</h3>
<p>The agreement stipulated a loan with collateral. However, when the loan reached seven or eight thousand yuan, the bank refused to honor the checks. The fraudulent behavior included fabricating false accounts and mortgaging the bank's own shares. Further questioning of other plaintiffs, such as Wang Ruyao, revealed that their accusations centered on the forgery of accounts and fraudulent acquisition of property. The bank claimed a fully paid-up share capital of 50 million, but in reality, only 300,000 was ever collected. Furthermore, at the time of the collapse, the bank secretly repurchased issued shares from favored shareholders to exempt them from shareholder liability. The amount of</p>
<h3>Repurchased Shares</h3>
<p>was approximately over ten thousand, with names available for verification. Liang Yaoting, for instance, was one of the shareholders whose shares were repurchased. Consequently, the records in the share capital book were all falsified. On November 25th, I mortgaged two title deeds with the bank for 23,000 yuan. Only after the collapse did I discover that the bank's records showed the mortgage amount as 50,000 yuan. Furthermore, the bank secretly re-mortgaged the title deeds with the Shanghai Bank, again for 50,000 yuan. They also secretly mortgaged other stocks I had deposited with them to the Hua An Insurance Company, obtaining a loan of 5,000 yuan. The bank currently</p>

<p>and two assistants, etc. When questioned, the defendant Li Jingwei, who served as an inspector of the bank, stated that the closure was due to the depletion of funds, making it impossible to continue operations. He claimed that if all outstanding debts could be recovered, they might offset the liabilities. He also mentioned that Wei provided significant assistance to the bank, and the bank had also acted as a guarantor for Wei. The title deeds in question were voluntarily lent by Wei to the bank as collateral. It was impossible to transfer the title without Wei's consent. Judge Liu then adjourned the hearing to February 9th in the afternoon. Li Jingwei, being employed by the Railway Bureau, was exempted from bail.</p>
<p>Vice President of the Central Bank, Chen Xing, in Debt Dispute</p>
<h3>Yan Zhumeizeng filed a lawsuit and Chen replied that he only owed a thousand gold or so.</h3>
<p>Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank, recently also concurrently assumed the position of Director of the Shanghai Mint after the resignation of Lu Xuepu, demonstrating the high regard the financial authorities have for him. Chen, whose given name is Jian'an and hails from Zhuji, Zhejiang, came from a poor family. His father died early, and he was raised by his mother. Chen was intelligent from a young age, and especially studious once he began formal education. He was not discouraged by his family's poverty. Later, while studying at St. John's University in Shanghai, he caught the attention of Yan Zhuyun, the respected father of Yan Dunyuan, the former Minister of Interior of the Beijing government, who recognized his potential. At the time, Yan's fourth daughter, Shufen, was unmarried. Yan arranged for her to marry Chen. From then on, besides providing for Chen's educational expenses, Yan also occasionally provided him with money to send home to his family. After Chen graduated from St. John's, Yan further funded his studies in the United States, hoping for him to achieve advanced knowledge. However, while in the United States, Chen fell in love with a woman surnamed Cai and eventually married her. By the time he completed his studies and returned to China with his family, his household was established. His fiancee, Yan Shufen, then approached him, reprimanding him for forgetting the kindness of his benefactor and breaking his engagement. Chen initially prevaricated, but eventually broke off the engagement entirely. Shufen then filed a lawsuit for cohabitation against Chen in the First Special District District Court after Chen was appointed as the President of the Central Bank. She stated that she was already of advanced age (Shufen was in her thirties at the time), and if Chen insisted on not fulfilling the marriage agreement, she vowed never to marry again, requesting Chen to pay a certain amount of alimony to support her future life. The case was litigated for over a year, and the outcome was reportedly settled through mediation by relatives and friends of both parties. Last year, Yan Zhuyun's widowed daughter-in-law, Yan Zhumeizeng, initiated a lawsuit because Yan Zhuyun had left a will after his death mentioning that he had repeatedly lent money to Chen Xing in the past, amounting to a considerable sum of 25,000 yuan. Now that the relationship between Yan and Chen was no longer that of relatives, and Chen had risen in status and become wealthy, the old debt should be repaid. Yan Zhuyun's estate was inherited by his two grandsons, Yan Zhumeizeng's sons, Yongjie and Yongzhen. Yan Zhumeizeng, acting as their legal guardian, sued Chen Xing in the First Special District Court for the unpaid loan of 25,000 yuan and interest. However, the initial trial resulted in the plaintiff's defeat. Yan Zhumeizeng, unwilling to accept the outcome, hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Peng Yuanxun, Xue Dubi, Cao Shoulin, etc., to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. In addition to citing Yan Zhuyun's will as evidence, they also included a letter from Chen's uncle, Chen Mianfu, to Ye Shuheng, regarding Yan's patronage of Chen: "Jian'an and you have been friends for many years and have received countless favors from the Yan family, almost nurtured and raised by them. If he has any conscience, how could he fail the Yan family and fail you?" This wording was intended to prove the authenticity of the loan, requesting the overturning of the original judgment and a favorable ruling. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Li of the Second Branch of the High Court convened a joint panel to hear the case. After the lawyer representing the appellant stated the grounds for the appeal, he added that in the spring of the 18th year of the Republic, the Yan family had even entrusted lawyer Jiang Baoli to write to Chen Xing demanding repayment. He noted that Yan Zhuyun had passed away in the summer of that year, and that part of the loan had been transferred through Ye Shuheng. All of this was supported by evidence. Even Chen's own letter to Yan Shufen mentioned "the Yan family's help with educational expenses." If he now denied it, it would be a contradiction of his own words. Chen Xing did not attend the hearing, but also hired a lawyer to represent him. However, his defense stated that the loan amount was only 1,300 yuan. After deliberation, Presiding Judge Li deemed it necessary to conduct further investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<p>A Woman Accused of Fraud Had Two Gold Rice Bowls Customized</p>
<h3>The Second Special Court Held a Hearing Yesterday and Requires Further Evidence Investigation Before Another Hearing</h3>
<p>Cheng Xu, a local woman residing in a garret at No. 6 Dahua Lane, Bai'er Road, French Concession, age forty-four, had been continuously purchasing large quantities of gold jewelry and valuable jade ornaments from Lao Xiansheng Hengji Silver Shop since the beginning of October last year and then bringing them to exchange in the same shop. Zhao Lingzeng, a Ningbo native (age twenty-six) and the manager of the silver shop, regarded her as a great customer and eagerly welcomed her trades. The woman accumulated a debt of 5,201 yuan and 5 jiao 1 fen. Because she had no money to pay, she handed over twenty-nine pawn tickets for the jade ornaments as temporary collateral. On January 12th of this year, Ms. Xu suddenly gathered more than ten gangsters and went to Lao Baosheng Silver Shop, posing as detectives and claiming to be investigating stolen goods, and forcibly took the pawn tickets. At this point, manager Zhao Lingzeng realized that Ms. Xu was a swindler, and he hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court accusing Cheng Xu of fraud, along with a civil lawsuit. The court accepted the case and held a hearing, but the defendant was arrested by the Municipal Security Bureau for committing similar fraud cases in the Chinese Concession and transferred to the Procuratorate of the District Court for interrogation, so she could not appear in court. It was ordered to postpone the hearing. All the details have been recorded in previous reports. The Second Special Court prepared a document and dispatched police to the District Court to bring Cheng Xu to court. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Wu Fanglian held a hearing. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intention to prosecute. Then, according to plaintiff Zhao Lingzeng, when the defendant came to purchase the goods, she claimed to be the mother-in-law of Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the Penglai Market, and that compatriots of Kuang from Wuxi had entrusted her to purchase the goods in Shanghai. The total value of the transactions was around 18,000. Once, she came to buy two gold rice bowls, saying that Liu Hongsheng, a Ningbo gentleman in Shanghai, had asked her to buy them. Two days later, she handed over one of the bowls to Qinghua Silver Shop in Hongkou. Some of the goods were pawned at Baotai Pawnshop in Huangjiaguan. Around December last year, she said she had no money to pay, so she temporarily mortgaged the pawn tickets. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, she sent people to come and forcibly take the pawn tickets. When she came to shop, everyone in my shop knew about it. When questioned, the defendant, Cheng Xu, replied, "Zhao asked me to sell the goods for him. He has hurt me so much that I can't stand it anymore. All the money for the goods I bought from him has been paid off, and I have invoices to prove it. Now, I only owe him about a thousand yuan." The defendant's defense lawyer then presented twenty-three invoices to the court. The court considered that the case still required the investigation of evidence and the summoning of witnesses, so it was ordered to wait for another hearing at a later date. The defendant, Cheng Xu, was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>During the Spring Festival Holiday, Why Not Visit Chao Mountain and Haiyun Cave?</h3>
<p>The plum blossoms of Chao Mountain in Zhejiang and Hangzhou are the most beautiful in the Southeast. Recently, due to the warm weather, spring is coming early. The fragrance of the plum blossoms on Qunyu Mountain is gradually spreading. Haiyun Cave is the most beautiful place in the whole mountain. Not only does it offer a high vantage point, but the plum blossoms along the mountain for thirty li can be seen at a glance. The snowy blossoms resemble a sea, creating a grand spectacle. Moreover, the scenery is serene and secluded, no less so than the misty and rosy clouds on West Lake. Therefore, poets and artists have often visited this place and left inscriptions. The cliffs are covered with calligraphy. The late Wu Changshuo, a master of art, also carved his excellent poems here, which will last for a thousand years. The Qianyuan Temple next to the cave houses the tombstone of Ding Gong, written in regular script by a calligrapher during the Ming Dynasty, as well as clay sculptures by Liu Lan and stone carvings of Ming Dynasty officials Ding Xixuan and his son. These historical records can be seen here. Recently, the small paths leading into the mountain have been paved into a wide road. All the remaining historical sites have also been reorganized. The Taoist temple and guesthouse have been renovated. During the Spring Festival holiday, those who are tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, why not visit?</p>

<p>The Kidnapping of Gao Maogong</p>
<h3>Detained for Five Days and Nights, Bandits Give Travel Expenses and Force Him to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Gao Maogong, a 32-year-old engineer from Xinchang, Zhejiang, working at the Shunchang Iron Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Bailinan Road, Zhabei, was mistakenly kidnapped on the morning of the 19th of this month. On the 23rd, Gao's wife, Shi Lanxuan, suddenly received a telegram from Gao in Xinchang, Ningbo, stating that he had escaped danger and arrived home. At that time, the city's police authorities, in order to clarify the truth, dispatched detectives by boat to Xinchang to investigate. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Detectives Zhu Bengui and Zhong Xuehuai returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing their mission and reported to the team. According to them, Gao was seized by the bandits, and they put dark glasses on him. Two bandits with guns guarded him on both sides. When the car stopped near the Mingxing Film Company on Dumei Road in the French Concession, the bandits took Gao out of the car and transferred him to a pre-arranged bandit car parked by the roadside. At that time, Gao's eyes had been covered with a black cloth by the bandits, so he could not tell the route or direction. He only felt that there were many turns. Soon the car stopped again, and he was pushed into a house and walked up to the third floor. Only then did his eyes see the light of day again. However, the 130 yuan in cash, business cards, and silver watch he had on him had been searched and taken away by the bandits. At the same time, the bandits also realized they had mistakenly kidnapped him, so after briefly asking about Gao's background, they handcuffed his hands, locked him in a room, and sent bandits to guard him in shifts day and night. For five days and nights, Gao constantly pleaded with the bandits, hoping for his freedom. Until the afternoon of the 23rd, a bandit went to deliver a message, claiming that "the commander (bandit leader)" had approved his release and gave him ten yuan for travel expenses, ordering a bandit to accompany him to the Ningshao Wharf in Nanshi, forcing him to board a Xin Beijing steamer to leave Shanghai, forbidding him to speak out along the way and not to look back, otherwise he would be harmed. Gao was forced to board the boat to Ningbo, and then sent a telegram to Shanghai to report the news. Gao is currently ill in his hometown, so he cannot come to Shanghai for the time being. The public document from the Xinchang Public Security Bureau and the details of the case have been reported by Wang Dasui, the chief of the Caojiadu branch, to the General Bureau for filing, and he has continued to order his subordinates to strictly arrest the criminals for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Large Gambling Den Raided in Qichang Dock, Pudong, 25 People Arrested</h3>
<p>Recently, someone set up a large-scale gambling den in house number 30, lane 223, Qichang Dock, Pudong, called Bagu Company, soliciting customers to gamble. There were many types of gambling, including shaking Bao dice, Pai Gow, poker, etc. The stakes were high. After the Pudong Public Security Bureau found out about it, Zhang, the chief of the branch bureau, dispatched servicemen Shao Ying, patrol police chief Guo Yongliang, and more than ten policemen, including Zhang Qiming and Liu Shaotang, to surround the gambling den at 12:40 a.m. the other day. They immediately went inside to search and arrested on the spot the gambling head, Wang Xianglang, from Chongming, and gamblers Wang Bizhong, Wang Yanglang, Chen Genfa, Lu Ruigong, Chen Zhaosheng, Wang Jinxiang, Wu Anqing, Yin Sheng, Xu Zhengfu, Xu Afu, Liang Wenbao, Jia Gengen, Li Shifa, Shen Bingzhang, Ge Weiming, Wu Jinfu, Zhao Sanlang, Zhang Heshang, Gu Xieqing, Yang Xiangkui, Shi Ada, Yu Mengchu, Xu Hongshi, and Yin Jiamei, a total of twenty-five men and women. They confiscated gambling equipment: one Bao box, one Pai Gow set, one poker set, twelve decks of playing cards, a stack of tally sheets, one money cylinder, gambling money: 16 yuan in silver dollars, 1 jiao 8 fen in small silver coins, and 30 copper coins. The witnesses were also taken to the bureau. Gambling head Wang Xianglang confessed that he had organized the gambling because of financial difficulties and had been taking a cut. The gamblers all made excuses. Bureau Chief Zhang, with the witnesses in custody, did not allow them to deny it and ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for disposal yesterday morning.</p>

<p>The German Manager of a Mushroom Factory Indecently Assaulted a Young Girl</p>
<h3>Yu Daqiao Was Victimized and the Prosecutor Investigated</h3>
<p>Yu Hanqing, a native of Hubei, used to work as a messenger in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. When the war broke out in Shanghai, Yu resigned and has been unemployed since then, living in Lincoln Road, Dada West Road, Shanghai West. Yu's wife, Ms. Mao (from Suqian), and their fourteen-year-old daughter, Daqiao, used to work in a yarn factory. Recently, Ms. Mao and her daughter switched to working at the nearby Daxi Farm (i.e., mushroom factory). However, after finishing work each day, Ms. Mao would return home first, while Yu Daqiao had to stay at the factory for one or two hours before returning home. This went on for about two weeks. Ms. Mao noticed that her beloved daughter was exhausted and very different from before, so she interrogated her. Eventually, she learned that the manager of the mushroom factory, a German named Xu Naiman (transliteration), had licked her lower part and threatened to keep it a secret. The woman was shocked to hear this. She believed that the Westerner had abused the young girl, violating human ethics and morals, and harming her beloved daughter's body. Therefore, she was unwilling to accept this and filed a lawsuit with the District Court, stating the facts. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Jianqing was ordered to escort the plaintiffs, Ms. Yu Mao and her daughter Yu Daqiao, to arrest the suspect. The police first reported to the Lincoln Road Police Station, and then secretly dispatched police officers to the factory to arrest the Westerner Xu Naiman and immediately brought him to the court. Prosecutor Zhang Zi conducted an investigation and ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for Shanghai Municipal Facilities in the 24th Year of the Republic of China (Continued)</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's Report at the Expanded Commemoration Week</p>
<p>(II) Resolving the Rickshaw Problem: The rickshaw problem has become a significant issue in Shanghai today. All those concerned about social issues are racking their brains, diligently researching how to improve the rickshaw system and the lives of rickshaw pullers. Not only those concerned with social issues are conducting extensive research, but also foreigners in the Public Concession are earnestly studying it. Rickshaw pullers are Chinese, and their suffering should be deeply understood by us. They pull their rickshaws on the streets all day long, regardless of exhaustion or breathlessness, wind or rain, or under the scorching sun on asphalt roads that are almost melting and scalding their feet, continuing to run tirelessly. Some even work hard all day without earning enough for basic necessities. Therefore, many foreigners passing through Shanghai have said to me, "Why don't you improve the lives of rickshaw pullers who live like cattle and horses? Why don't you find a way to solve this problem?" Indeed, this is a social problem that urgently needs our attention and resolution. We know that, in reality, we cannot completely eliminate rickshaws, but we cannot ignore or fail to improve this system and the lives of rickshaw pullers. Therefore, this is also a responsibility that the Shanghai Municipal Government should strive to fulfill this year. I now have a suggestion to put forward for everyone to consider. I think the first step should be to pilot rickshaw puller cooperatives in the urban area. Initially, the rickshaws would be owned by the government, and gradually become jointly owned by the government and rickshaw pullers. Then, in the next step, they would become the sole property of the rickshaw pullers, achieving the goal of "rickshaw pullers owning their rickshaws." Our method and steps would roughly be as follows. This would not only improve the rickshaw system but also improve the treatment and lives of rickshaw pullers. In this way, the rickshaw problem might be solved. This is also work that our government should actually do for the people. I hope that all colleagues in the Municipal Government will study this together and ensure that it is implemented this year. This is the second thing that the Shanghai Municipal Government should strive for this year.</p>
<p>(III) Promoting Production Education: Regarding this issue, Director Pan and I have discussed it repeatedly over the past year and plan to implement it this year. It has been thirty or forty years since China began implementing modern education. The results of modern education over these three or four decades have not yet met our expectations. This is partly due to errors in our education system and spirit, and partly because the old ideas of the Chinese people have not yet been completely changed. This old idea is that scholars wear long gowns and use pens, while those who do not study wear short jackets and work in the fields. This has created a phenomenon where scholars do not engage in production, and those who engage in production do not study. This must be said to be the failure of promoting modern education over the past three or four decades. Therefore, six or seven years ago, when I was in Zhongshan County, I submitted a proposal to the Zhongshan County Political Training Committee. I wanted to completely reform the schools in each district of Zhongshan County. Except for the county-run higher primary school, all other schools would be converted into vocational schools. My intention was not only to enable everyone in the rural areas to know how to produce, but also to cultivate the backbone of talent in the rural areas to manage local autonomy. Currently, there are two dangerous symptoms in rural China. One is that children from rural areas who go to school do not engage in farming. Not only do they not engage in farming, but they also leave their hometowns and go to the county seat, and then from the county seat to the cities. Therefore, the result of the development of rural education is that the rural population decreases day by day, and the number of rural production elements also decreases day by day. Rural production naturally decreases accordingly, leading to the collapse of the rural economy. The second is that there is simply no one in the current rural areas who can manage autonomy. Those who engage in production in the rural areas are not educated, and those who are educated leave the rural areas to go to the cities. They neither engage in production nor serve their hometowns. In the past, there were local tyrants and evil gentry who managed local affairs. While local tyrants and evil gentry who exploited the villagers should be overthrown, there is no one to succeed them and manage local affairs and serve the local community. Not only is local autonomy impossible to implement, but the rural areas are also becoming increasingly empty. These two dangerous symptoms in rural areas are the biggest reasons for rural bankruptcy. To save the current symptoms of rural areas and avoid the collapse of rural areas, we must implement production education and reform the mistakes of past education to be successful. Therefore, this city plans to implement production education this year, opening a vocational middle school and dividing the suburbs of Shanghai into four districts: east, south, west, and north. Each district will add a vocational primary school centered on rural areas. Each primary school will have an attached farm, one for horticulture, one for fruit trees, one for rice cultivation, and one for animal husbandry. Colleagues, you must know that Shanghai is a large metropolis with three or four million people. The amount of agricultural products consumed in Shanghai every day is extremely large. Not to mention vegetables and fruits, the consumption of flowers alone, according to surveys and statistics, has reached a huge sum of ten thousand yuan per day. These large quantities of agricultural products are mostly supplied by the suburbs of Shanghai. However, the farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai do not plant in the right way, and the production of crops is not abundant, resulting in land being wasted, which is a pity. Therefore, we want to attach various farms to the vocational primary schools in the four districts of east, south, west, and north, so that the children of farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai can receive not only general education but also various production knowledge and skills. Not only that, but it can also give middle-aged and elderly farmers in the rural areas an opportunity to increase their agricultural knowledge in order to improve agricultural production methods. In addition, we will also set up a relatively complete vocational middle school as a place for further study for the children of farmers. As for other schools, we also want to gradually improve them. This is the third thing that the Shanghai Municipal Government should strive for this year.</p>
<p>(IV) National Military Training: Everyone knows that military training in Shanghai is currently limited to schools and defense corps, and is mostly makeshift, or even nominal, failing to meet our expectations. Therefore, this year, regarding national military training, we want to come up with a new system and method, training in shifts and in a centralized manner. It is not enough to just train in schools or defense corps. We must train in a way that thoroughly disciplines, collectivizes, and militarizes the loose, chaotic, and dispirited lives of our general public, fundamentally refreshing the spirit of our nation and enriching the self-defense capabilities of our citizens. This is the fourth thing that the Shanghai Municipal Government should strive for this year.</p>
<p>(V) Popularizing Mass Education: Popularizing education is a fundamental task for developing national strength and promoting municipal administration. Currently, in Shanghai, we roughly estimate that among the three or four million citizens, about 25% of adults are illiterate, so-called illiterates. Now the central government has decided on a plan to popularize mass education. We now want to use one year to educate the adults in this city in order to solve the problem of illiteracy. The plan is to first find ways to teach the illiterate people in this city between the ages of fifteen and thirty to read this year, and then teach them the basic common sense that citizens should have, in order to establish a foundation for developing national strength and promoting municipal administration. This is the fifth thing that the Shanghai Municipal Government should strive for this year.</p>
<p>(VI) Repairing Embankments: The embankments of this city have been in disrepair for many years and are deteriorating day by day. Every year in July and August, Director Shen always asks for funds to repair them. Although the municipal government is in dire financial straits, it still allocates funds for repairs. However, because funds are limited, they are repaired and then damaged again, and to this day, we cannot help but consider it a hidden worry. Therefore, we want to greatly repair them this year if the municipal government's finances allow, raising one million yuan. Although we dare not say that it can be done once and for all, we must at least find a reasonable solution to the embankment problem in Shanghai. This is the sixth thing that the Shanghai Municipal Government should strive for this year.</p>
<p>The above six undertakings are all tasks that the colleagues of the Shanghai Municipal Government should work together on this year. Governance is not about talking too much, but about being consistent in word and deed, and being effective in action. What China needs most at this time is practical and rapid action. Empty talk is of no help in these difficult times. In the past, the facilities of this city, although constrained by financial and other factors, have not dared to be said to be fully satisfactory, but at least most of what was said has been put into practice. How are we going to make what has been stated today consistent in word and deed and effective in action? There are two prerequisite issues: one is the issue of how to raise funds, and the other is the issue of methods and plans. Although I have given these two issues deep thought and have some ideas, for the sake of gathering wisdom, I am now specifically proposing them again, asking all the colleagues of the entire municipal government to study and design them together. On the one hand, study how to raise funds, and on the other hand, design how to carry out the plan. Then, everyone will work together to make it so that all the comrades who serve in the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 24th year of the Republic of China will make a very significant and fruitful contribution to the society of Shanghai and the three or four million people of Shanghai this year, and not disappoint the good times of the 24th year of the Republic of China, as well as the ardent expectations of all the citizens for us.</p>
<p>Today's commemoration week coincides with the third anniversary of the January 28th Incident, so we have specially gathered colleagues from various bureaus here to jointly hold it, remembering the past and inspiring the future. Therefore, I will report the guidelines that the colleagues of the Shanghai Municipal Government should strive for this year to all comrades, and I hope that all colleagues will work together to ensure that these plans can be realized. Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us, "The purpose of revolution is construction, and the most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood." He also said, "The purpose of revolution lies in the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. If the Principle of People's Livelihood is not implemented, there is no need for revolution." From this, we can see the importance of the people's livelihood. If the people's livelihood can be solved, our country can be rich, and the people can be strong. A rich country and strong people can enrich the strength of the country. After the strength of the country is enriched, it can guarantee the survival of our nation. A few days ago, when Chiang Kai-shek passed through Shanghai, he summoned the responsible comrades of this government. He told us that in the past few years, due to various reasons, our work has been biased towards the static aspect. This year, our work should be biased towards the dynamic aspect. The so-called dynamic work is to do more social construction work, and social construction work should pay more attention to the people's livelihood. Therefore, we have decided to use the six points just mentioned as the direction of our efforts for the Shanghai Municipal Government this year, and to use education, cultivation, and hygiene as the highest principles of our Shanghai Municipal Government's administration in the future. I sincerely hope to work with all the colleagues of this government to strive towards this goal and make achievements in the 24th year of the Republic of China. (End)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Little Western Heaven</p>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Remote Land, Weak Officials, Strong Orders from Afar; Grand Banquet in a Fine Hall, with Pitiable Creatures Outside</p>
<p>Zhang Jiefu had never heard of such a thing, and couldn't say a word for a long time. After a while, he said, "I really didn't expect that it would be so difficult to get an official position in Shaanxi." Zhiqian smiled and said, "In that case, Zhang, doesn't that diminish your interest in becoming an official?" Jiefu had finally managed to get Zhiqian to agree to help him, but now he suddenly said that the position was not worth taking, which was like cutting off his own path. So he smiled and said, "In my opinion, such counties must be in the minority. I don't think all the counties in Guanzhong are like that." Zhou Yourong smiled and said, "Everyone knows that, but if there's a good place, who wouldn't want to go? I'm just afraid that we, coming from so far away, will be seen by the authorities as being here to work, and they won't give us the easy positions." Zhang Jiefu lowered his head and thought for a moment. What he said made sense. However, what he wanted was just a minor position, and he certainly wouldn't come into direct conflict with the military authorities, so he didn't need to be completely discouraged. At that moment, he could only smile and say, "Well, it depends on human effort." Zhou Yourong smiled and said, "That's right. Although Shaanxi is a tough place, there are quite a few county magistrates who have gotten rich and gone home, so how did I get beaten back? If a gentleman like Zhang has that kind of spirit, and isn't afraid of being beaten, then maybe he can get an official position and make a fortune." Zhang Jiefu felt that his words were a bit aggressive, and his face reddened slightly. Zhou Yourong also realized that he had said something wrong, and quickly changed the subject, asking Zhiqian, "Brother Zhiqian said he was going to introduce some women for employment, what kind of women are they?" Zhiqian said, "Does County Magistrate Zhou need a maid?" Yourong waved his hands repeatedly, "No, no, I have a friend, whose wife has just arrived in Xi'an from the East, and she has two young children, making things very inconvenient. She must have a maid. And besides needing someone to do general chores, she also needs someone to lead the children." (125)</p>
<h3>What I Saw in the Naked Country</h3>
<p>— By Kang Jianzhaifu</p>
<p>| Short Fragments of Primitive Life |</p>
<p>Recently, a friend sent a letter from the South Pacific Islands. In his wanderings, he came to a little-known coral island not far from Australia. There, he saw tattooed barbarians with cropped hair and naked primitive people living in nests.</p>
<p>The people there, young and old, male and female, all wear nothing except for a cloth woven from banana leaves or bark to cover their private parts, and the rest of their bodies are naked all year round, bathing in the sunlight of nature. The young women's breasts are high and erect, the larger the more beautiful.</p>
<p>Because they don't wear clothes, both men and women consider tattoos to be beautiful. Children have their foreheads and noses tattooed from a young age. At the age of eleven or twelve, girls begin to wear skirts. This skirt is just a strip of banana leaf cloth to cover their private parts. At that time, from the waist to the knees, front and back, they are all tattooed with fish patterns. When they are about to give birth for the first time after marriage, they tattoo their breasts, chest, back, arms, and even their chins with flowers, leaving no gaps. When they are being tattooed, their skin breaks and bleeds, causing great pain. But in order to satisfy their aesthetic appearance, they</p>
<h3>The Development of Shanghai Hospitals (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>At that time, there was also a hospital in the British and American concessions named "Tiren Hospital." In 1882, due to insufficient funds, it was merged into Tongren Hospital on August 14 of the same year.</p>
<p>In January 1887, Wu Hongyu again persuaded Li Qiuping, the Chinese manager of Gao Yi Foreign Firm, to donate 5,000 yuan, which was originally intended for the construction of the Jing'an Temple, to the hospital. He also raised the same amount from relatives and friends. As a result, Tongren Hospital was able to renovate suitable buildings, and its scale was further expanded.</p>
<p>In 1903, the women's department of Tongren Hospital was separated and established on Edinburgh Road, named Guangren Hospital.</p>
<p>(Note) This statement is based on "The Shanghai Handbook" by Pastor Davin De, but we believe that the so-called "Mai" should refer to Walter Henry Medhurst rather than Morrison. Medhurst arrived in Shanghai at the same time as Walter Henry Medhurst. The people of Shanghai certainly knew him better than Morrison. Moreover, is it necessary to misinterpret the sound of the character "Mai"? This is recorded for reference.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we will list the foreign public hospitals, the most famous of which are the General Hospital and the Paulun Hospital. The General Hospital is located by the Suzhou River and is easily seen looking north from the Garden Bridge (that is, the Outer Bund Bridge). It was founded in 1864 and rebuilt in 1920. Its organization is "a permanently elected board of directors according to their positions (including three consuls-general, four taxpayers from the Public Concession, and two taxpayers from the French Concession) to carry out its duties." The nursing duties of the hospital have always been undertaken by the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul for 50 years without change. In 1912, due to difficulties in the French church and the fact that those in charge of the church believed that nursing hindered pure practice, the entire group resigned.</p>
<p>In 1899, the area around Xinzha was designated as the International Public Concession, and the Municipal Council of the former British and American Concession took over the merged management. The leading consul (the German Consul-General, Knappe) advocated building a hospital because the foreign population was dense and the poor and sick were pitiful. It was named "Tongji" so that it and Renji Hospital in the old British Concession and Tongren Hospital in the old American Concession stood together in a tripod-like manner. Because he was German, he advocated that it should be a German-style hospital, so he invited the famous German medical scientist Dr. Paulun to preside over the hospital, and also received a lot of help from Althoff, the German Chancellor, in terms of funding. The hospital opened in May 1902. In 1909, Dr. Paulun passed away, so Tongji Hospital changed its name to commemorate him.</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council also established several hospitals for special municipal needs, which were managed by the Health Department, namely:</p>
<p>Isolation Hospital Established in 1904</p>
<p>Mental Hospital Established in 1907</p>
<p>Chinese Police Hospital Established in 1907</p>
<p>Indian Police Hospital Established in 1908</p>
<p>Prison Hospital Established in 1903</p>
<p>From 1843 to 1903 (from the year Shanghai opened as a port to the year before the Russo-Japanese War), Shanghai's hospital business was almost entirely monopolized by foreigners. Even if Chinese people occasionally learned new medical skills, they only served in foreign hospitals. In the spring of 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out, affecting Northeast China. Shanghai people such as Shen Zhongli and Wang Peiyuan initiated the International Red Cross Society to rescue people in the war zone. After the war ended, it was renamed the Chinese Red Cross Society and successively opened three hospitals in Shanghai to provide daily services to the community:</p>
<p>(1) General Hospital Haig Road Established in 1910</p>
<p>(2) North Shanghai Hospital Xinzha Road Established in 1913</p>
<p>(3) South Shanghai Hospital Waitan Road Established in 1913</p>
<p>From August 1932, the names were changed, and in the order listed above, they were called "First," "Second," and "Third" Hospitals.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of Chinese-run hospitals. Then there were two more public hospitals known for their historical achievements:</p>
<p>Public Shanghai Hospital Established in 1909, gentry Li Zhongjue borrowed the Jicang public land to raise donations for construction.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Overall Evaluation Report on the National Labor Exhibition</h3>
<p>Good Quality Products from Middle Schools, Normal Schools, and Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Too Few Agricultural and Farming Achievements</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 29th) The Ministry of Education issued an overall evaluation report on the National Labor Exhibition on the 29th. The full text is ten thousand words. The following is a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of the overall evaluation of the achievements: The advantage is that many middle schools and normal schools use labor courses to make scientific models and teaching aids, which are not only related to science teaching but also can be used in practice. The products of vocational schools are practical and no different from actual commodities, and they can also use local specialty products to make practical items. Elementary schools can use labor teaching materials to make various national defense toys, arousing children's interest in national defense and paying attention to national rejuvenation. The disadvantage is that the products of schools in various provinces and cities are the same, lacking creative spirit, and many are not practical. The number of normal school products is too large, and they fail to fully demonstrate the special training spirit of labor teachers. There are too few agricultural and farming achievements, and the products of rural unaccredited schools, except for Qingdao, Shandong, are rarely seen. Schools pay little attention to investigating local production businesses, and many products do not seem to be the usual achievements of students but are made specifically for the exhibition. The achievements of home economics courses mostly focus on luxury goods and fail to meet practical life needs.</p>
<p>Procedures and Escort Issues for Exhibits Participating in the British Arts Exhibition</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee Has Decided on Proper Measures</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th) The Preparatory Committee for the British Exhibition of Chinese Art has decided on the procedures for exhibiting items and protecting and transporting them as follows: (A) Before the items leave the country (1) The preliminary list of exhibits will be drawn up by the special committee of the Chinese Preparatory Committee and the producing agency, but the Preparatory Committee reserves the right to retain items it deems particularly important.

<p>All Primary Schools in Jiangsu Province Are Organized into Baojia</p>
<h3>Cultivating Students' Self-Government Ability</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs previously reported that the Jiangpu County Government requested that all primary schools at all levels in the county be organized into Baojia in order to cultivate students' self-government ability and instill Baojia common sense. After review, the proposed measures were deemed feasible, so a special request was made to the Department of Education to order all other counties to follow suit. According to inquiries, the main points of the Baojia organization measures in Jiangpu County schools are as follows: When organizing, the entire school is regarded as a township, one classroom as one Bao, a horizontal row as one Jia, and each student as one household. Single-grade primary schools only have one Bao. Schools with six or more classrooms can be organized into two townships. Two or more townships can form a district. The district has one district chief, who is elected by the district people's congress. When starting the organization, doorplates are affixed to each student's desk. After the organization is clear, each Jia will jointly issue a joint guarantee, add fingerprints, and declare mutual supervision and compliance with school rules. In addition, Baojia regulations are formulated to implement the new life as the goal. When students graduate, drop out, take leave of absence, and enroll, they should fill out the household registration change form in accordance with the regulations and report it to the principal at each level.</p>
<p>Han Traitors Under Japanese Enslavement Also Promote Anesthetic Education</p>
<h3>Winter Vacation Teachers' Japanese and Classics Training Institute Organizes Confucianism Association and Hires Pseudo-Dignitaries to Join</h3>
<p>(Northeast News Agency, Nenjiang News) Recently, in addition to the violent Japanese implementing enslavement education in the Northeast, the general Han traitors actually automatically promote anesthetic education and theories, which is extremely shameless. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Tool for Flattering Japan</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, education in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, has been in a state of stagnation, and it can be said that there is no education to speak of due to the devastation of the violent Japanese. Later, the Japanese restarted it and replaced it with enslavement education. The general students have been subjected to their enslavement education, and to the extent that they have weakened our North China youth's national concept. It is already inhumane for the violent Japanese to implement this kind of poisonous policy, but recently the pseudo-county chief of the county, Cui, took office on January 1 this year. This Han traitor is extremely shameless and actually uses flattering Japan as a tool for promotion and wealth. All school teachers in the county must be trained in the teachers' training institute for one month during this winter vacation. The most important courses are: (1) learning Japanese, (2) studying classics. The county chief also said that Japanese is a benefit of "Manchukuo" cooperation, and classics are the source of the royal way. By promoting the fallacy of anesthetizing one's own nation in this way, this Han traitor can be said to have no conscience at all.</p>
<h3>Confucianism in Name Only</h3>
<p>In addition to being willing to be slaves of the violent Japanese, the general shameless Han traitors in the Northeast also use Confucianism in name only to anesthetize themselves so that they can maintain high positions and high salaries for a long time. Originally, the Confucianism Association was established last winter, and the pseudo-provincial governors of various provinces were hired as honorary chairmen, and the pseudo-vice ministers of various ministries were hired as consultants. The pseudo-provincial governors and pseudo-vice ministers of various ministries have successively sent letters agreeing to take on the positions.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Method for Retroactively Recognizing the Qualifications of Graduates Before Establishment</h3>
<p>Because China College requested an explanation of the method for retroactively recognizing the qualifications of graduates before establishment, the Ministry of Education specially instructed the school to still follow Article 6 of Instruction No. 8699 of the 22nd year. (Check the clause, which says that graduates who fail to obtain retroactive recognition according to the previous standards may request the original school to submit to the Ministry a request to take the qualification examination for graduates of private junior colleges or above before establishment. The method is as follows: (A) In accordance with the conditions for requesting retroactive recognition specified in Article 5, the original school shall submit the application to the Ministry for approval and registration. (B) The qualification examination shall be held regularly by the Ministry. One month before the examination, the Ministry shall publish a notice in the newspaper to inform the students who have been approved for registration. (C) The examination subjects are divided into two categories: general and specialized. The general subjects are Chinese and Party Ideology (the Three Principles of the People). There are five to eight specialized subjects, and they will also be notified one month before the examination. (D) Graduates who pass the qualification examination will have their graduation qualifications recognized. (E) Each student may take the qualification examination for a maximum of two times.</p>

<p>Recent News on the Painting Exhibition of the Social Education Society</p>
<h3>Today and Tomorrow Are the Last Two Days</h3>

<p>Japanese Education Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Sightseeing Education in Kyoto, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou</h3>

<h3>Sales of College and Middle School Entrance Examination Guidance Are Brisk</h3>
<p>In recent days, students in colleges and middle schools have been rushing to take entrance examinations for schools. Because they are not familiar with the examination procedures and do not have sufficient preparation, many fail and fail. The Diligent Bookstore at 392 Rue du Pere Robert, Shanghai, specially hired Lu Shaoji, the director of academic affairs of the Shanghai Middle School of Jiangsu Province, to compile two new books: "College Entrance Examination Guidance" and "Middle School Entrance Examination Guidance." The two books are the result of Mr. Lu's more than ten years of experience in education. Cai Yuanpei, the president of the Academia Sinica, highly respected them. The content is rich, and the guidance is detailed. The following is a summary of the two books: (1) "College Entrance Examination Guidance": The book is divided into six chapters: Chapter 1: Guidance on Youth Advancement, Chapter 2: Regulations on Higher Education in China, Chapter 3: Preparation Before the Examination, Chapter 4: How to Deal with the Entrance Examination, Chapter 5: Preparation After Admission, Chapter 6: The Status of Higher Education Institutions in China. (2) "Middle School Entrance Examination Guidance" The book is divided into seven chapters: Chapter 1: Guidance on Youth Advancement, Chapter 2: Regulations on Secondary Education in China, Chapter 3: How to Choose a School, Chapter 4: Preparation Before the Examination, Chapter 5: Key Points of Etiquette During the Examination, Chapter 6: Preparation After Admission, Chapter 7: The Status of Secondary Education Institutions in China. Appendix: One of the Psychology of Youth Advancing to School. The above two books provide detailed guidance on any difficulties before and after the examination. They are the only secret guide for taking examinations. All college and middle school students engaged in taking examinations should read them to solve all difficulties in taking examinations. The price of each book is 60 cents. In order to give preferential treatment to readers, they are sold at half price. The special price of each book is 30 cents. The postage for overseas mail is 13 cents per book. Currently, many people are actively purchasing the books. The retail department of the bookstore at 277 Fourth Road in Shanghai also sells them at the same price.</p>
<p>Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School Adds New School Board Members</p>
<h3>Scheduled Discussions to Complete the Grand Plan of Restoration</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School, founded for nearly fourteen years, has been diligently managed by the Board of Directors and Principal Lu Lihua, and the school's affairs have gradually progressed. Its achievements over the years have been praised both domestically and internationally, and are well-known in all sectors. Unfortunately, it has been repeatedly affected by the current situation, resulting in considerable losses, especially during the January 28th Incident, which caused particularly severe damage. In the midst of profound pain, the school has strived to restore itself and has established a comprehensive plan. A significant portion of this plan has already been completed. However, the school aims for perfection and is committed to improving all facilities. Therefore, important constructions such as the gymnasium, library, artesian well, and horticulture field, as well as classrooms and dormitories that still need to be added, are all anticipated to be completed within the year. Currently, to strengthen the school's resources, prominent figures in Shanghai, including Wu Kaixian, Wu Xingya, and Shen Siliang, have been specially appointed as school board members to promote the development of the school's affairs. It is reported that a welcome reception for the new board members is scheduled for this Saturday, where discussions will also be held to complete the restoration plan.</p>

<h3>Furen Lost to McLing</h3>
<p>Evenly Matched, Fierce Competition</p>
<p>McLing's Locke Scored 30 Points Alone</p>
<p>Result: 44 to 37</p>
<p>Tonight, Furen Faces West Blue</p>
<p>The Beijing Furen University basketball team fought hard last night but still lost to McLing, with a score of 37 to 44. The Shenyuan basketball hall was filled with 800 to 900 spectators, creating a grand atmosphere. The overall situation was tense and exciting, with intense interest. After Furen initially took the lead, they followed McLing except for three leads at 7-5, 17-15, and 19-17. The first half saw several ties at 7-7, 15-15, 17-17, and 19-19, eventually losing the first half 19-23. In the second half, they made great efforts, showing a potential to come from behind, but ultimately failed to achieve their goals. In the end, they lost opportunities due to panic and were defeated.</p>
<h3>Locke Rampant</h3>
<p>The Shenyuan court was too large, leading to a sense of exhaustion. Furen moved quickly, but sometimes acted too hastily, missing opportunities. Forwards Li Yunzhong and Liu Xueqi were active and capable, deserving praise as outstanding talents. Guard Zhao Lin's defense was tight and indispensable. The entire team worked closely together, but lost many opportunities under the basket in the last five minutes, leading to their defeat, which was a pity. Moreover, they suffered from being shorter. McLing's long-legged Locke acted rampantly, scoring as many as 30 points alone. McLing's victory was entirely due to this man.</p>
<h3>Overwhelming Momentum</h3>
<p>After the initial contact, Furen's Li Yunzhong scored first, leading to 3-3 and then 5-5. After a brief stalemate, Liu Xueqi scored again under the basket, leading 7-5. McLing was like wolves and tigers, with overwhelming momentum. Locke and Billis scored five consecutive points, taking the lead at 10-7. At the same time, Furen's guard Lian Cheng was fouled out for the fourth time and replaced by Li Yunwu. Then, Locke and Johnson added three more points, taking a commanding lead at 13-7.</p>
<h3>Furen Strives</h3>
<p>Furen was eager to win, unwilling to fall behind, striving and showing a new spirit. Liu Xueqi and Zhao Lin caught up with three points. After McLing's Locke scored again, making it 15-10, Liu added three more points, and Li Yunwu made two consecutive free throws, tying the score at 15-15. The atmosphere in the whole stadium was tense, and the shouts were deafening. Li Yunzhong then scored again, achieving a 17-15 lead, and before the cheers subsided, McLing's Johnson returned the favor, immediately tying the score at 17. Li Yunzhong scored again, leading 19-17. Locke made two free throws, tying the score again. In an instant, Locke added two more goals, and McLing won the first half 23-19.</p>
<h3>Running out of steam</h3>
<p>At the restart, Locke of McLing stood out from the crowd, taking advantage and scoring repeatedly. Furen's guards found it difficult to defend. Wu Bixian and Li Yunzhong also contributed, but their gains did not make up for their losses, and the score once became 33-24, a difference of as many as nine points. At this time, Furen was truly facing a difficult situation. Their formation was chaotic, Li Yunwu was short and suffered losses, and Zhao Lin was unable to attend to everything, unable to respond in time.</p>
<h3>Panic and Missed Opportunities</h3>
<p>Furen tried their best to cheer up and slowly expand their plan. After Liu Xueqi and Wu Bixian added two goals in a row, their momentum suddenly surged, and they continued to work harder and became more energetic. Liu Xueqi scored repeatedly with close-range shots and long-range shots, chasing the score to 32-34, only two points behind, showing a great potential to come from behind. McLing's formation was disorganized, and Locke was heavily guarded and unable to do anything. After 36-38, Furen suddenly became eager to win, missed opportunities under the basket, and were extremely flustered. Then, with a moment of carelessness in the back, Locke showed his power again, and the score soared to 44-37, marking Furen's defeat.</p>
<h3>Playing Against West Blue</h3>
<p>Tonight is Furen's last battle in Shanghai, against West Blue, the basketball champion. Since the beginning of the season, this team has never been defeated. Furen's chances against them are slim, but if they can be cautious and fight calmly, they may be able to win by surprise. The game will still be held at Shenyuan at 8:30 tonight. The referees are Zhang Guoxun and Shu Hongyi. Last night's scores are as follows:</p>

<h3>On the Monk Not Running Away</h3>
<p>— Zai Qing</p>
<p>Liu Bannong, one of the most active figures in the early New Literature Movement, passed away in 1934. He left behind many works, especially the posthumously published "Bannong Essays," which is an important document in the history of the Chinese New Literature Movement. At the beginning of this book, he wrote a long preface explaining his attitude towards writing, his experiences, and the motivation for compiling the collection. At the end, he wrote a popular folk story in his usual humorous manner.</p>
<p>It is said that a constable was assigned to escort a monk. He was carrying a document, a bag of clothes, an umbrella, and a cangue on the monk's head. Along the way, the constable was afraid of losing anything, so he kept chanting: "Monk, document, clothes bag, umbrella, cangue." One night, the monk took advantage of the constable's deep sleep, shaved the constable's head, put his own cangue on the constable's neck, and secretly escaped. When the constable woke up, he touched his head and checked the things. The monk was there, the document was there, the clothes bag was there, the umbrella was there, only he himself was not there, "I don't know where I went."</p>
<p>After telling this story, he wrote below: "The so-called grasping the spirit of the times, the so-called standing in front of the times, I have never stopped envying and longing for this kind of beautiful talk. However, I am unwilling to grasp the monk and lose myself." The meaning is very clear, that is, literature that stands in front of the times and grasps the spirit of the times essentially lacks the existence of "self." Grasping the times and losing myself is like the monk running away and the constable being caught. He is unwilling to do this.</p>
<p>"Did the monk really run away?" I thought so when I read this passage. Before writing this article, I read Zhang Menglin's article on the settlement of Chinese literature in 1934 in "New China." In the part on essays, his conclusion is that essays are only personal subjective literature. This is indeed the case. The pity is that he did not know that in the essays of 1934, there was also a tendency to oppose the individual and oppose subjectivity. Liu Bannong knew that there was a "monk" besides the "constable," which can be said to be a step higher than Zhang Menglin. But in the end, he was dazzled. If he had not died and had rubbed his eyes, he would have definitely seen that the "constable" was still there, and the "monk" had not run away. The one who created this environment was his own dim eyes.</p>
<p>He thinks so, and maybe more others think so. Literature that is anti-individualistic and anti-subjective fundamentally has no "individual" and has lost the existence of "self." Actually, it is not so. It is said that there was such a thing. A temporary actor participated in the filming of a crowd scene. When the film was released, he proudly ran to the theater to watch it. Sure enough, the crowd scene he participated in the filming also appeared. There were so many people on one screen that he could not count them. However, he was sad. He could not see his own existence. He was annoyed by his own sacrifice. He almost cried. But in a flash, the screen faded into a part of the crowd. He saw his whole body, "So there is me." He was a little happy. Because he was next to the protagonist, the screen faded in again. He felt that he was too clear. He looked at the protagonist's big head: "So there are so many Jiang</p>
<p>people in him." He was no longer sad. The one who told the story of "the constable and the monk" essentially only saw the first screen in the movie during his lifetime.</p>
<p>What I am saying here may not fully express his original intention. The "monk" he was talking about may refer to the "consistency in thoughts and propositions" that I am talking about. This consistency is "someone else's" and not "one's own." Let's go back to his golden age in literature. He wrote "A Reply to Mr. Wang Jingxuan's Letter." He opposed the remnants of old literature. He advocated vernacular literature. But the promotion of vernacular literature did not begin with Liu Bannong. Then, in the early days of the New Literature Movement, wasn't he also a person who "grasped the monk and lost himself"? We cannot say that. There was still his own existence in it. This existing self was still very clear, and he himself probably would admit it.</p>
<p>Now it is different from the May Fourth period, and the "self" reflected in literature has changed. This change made him sigh, "Why don't I want to?" What has changed? It is that the "self" at that time was only dissolved in the lives of a few people, and the life of "self" only had consistency with a few people, so the existence of "self" was particularly obvious. Now, the times have progressed. People who grasp the spirit of the times are expanding the "self" and dissolving the life of "self" in the lives of most people. In the eyes of Liu Bannong and his group, the "self" is blurred, even submerged. In fact, what is grasped is "the monk" and also "the self."</p>
<p>It can be further explained. The current "self" is like the first screen mentioned above. The self exists, but because it is dissolved with everyone, it is not easy to see. The past self, such as the second and even the third independent screen, only dissolved a few people, and it was clear at a glance. It is easy to recognize people in strange clothes among the crowd, but it is not easy to find people in ordinary clothes. The reason is the same. The question is, does "self" want to be dissolved among a few people or among most people? Be careful that "the monk" runs away.</p>
<h3>Self-Comfort</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>The past life was like mud and stagnant water, but I prefer to relive those lives that resemble mud and stagnant water. Today, in today's memories, half of my heart is in pain, and the other half feels slightly comforted. In recent years, my life has been too complicated, with blood, terror, and tears, but also laughter. I don't know how many times in my dreams, I dreamed of those terrible encounters in the past, making me scream and fear until I woke up and realized it was just a nightmare!</p>
<p>However, in the mud, my heart can still bloom with pure white flowers. I can comfort myself with this.</p>
<p>Friends, think about it, how can people not be thin under the double squeeze of poverty and hunger? How can people not grow old! One by one, the enemy's hidden arrows were shot at my heart. I was injured. People would die if they were a little weaker. Fortunately, I am still alive and strong. In the past, there were several nights when I really wanted to leave this world quietly. However, this was just "thinking." In fact, I am still alive in this world. This world is evil and filthy, but how many people are hiding in the filth, laughing and singing triumphantly, feeling happy! I really don't understand why people's hearts are so far apart.</p>
<p>This time last year, my heart was being bitten by thousands of snakes, making me unable to shout or cry! This year, at this time, it seems to be a little better on the outside, but I am still enduring hidden pain to live my life.</p>
<p>Zhen came to play last night. He is also a person who has experienced many terrible events like me. His face is always sad and melancholy. Although I also have his share of sadness and melancholy in my heart, I still deliberately weave a lot of sweet words to comfort him and tell him not to be discouraged, but he doesn't like to listen because he knows the world better than I do. Sometimes I seem to feel that it is better for a person to have no wisdom or knowledge. Knowledge, knowledge can become a poisonous substance in some people's minds, so some people are willing to be buried in the graves they have dug themselves. Do you say he took the wrong path? No, in fact, he才said that you took the wrong path. What can be done?</p>
<p>The sea, the desert, agriculture and forestry, the city, the battlefield, hell, ······ I have traveled all over, making me accustomed to all kinds of hardships. The storms of the night, the darkness of hell, the iron whip of life, and the poisonous hidden arrows, I have all tasted. So, perhaps there will be an even heavier burden of suffering on my shoulders in the future, but I am not afraid because I am used to it.</p>
<p>I have seen many people subdued under the iron whip of life, but I am still willing to struggle in a harsh environment. Although it is苦, I also feel that it is worth it because this is what I am willing to do. Is there anything in the world more precious than freedom? No! Therefore, although the past life is like mud and stagnant water, my heart is blooming with pure white flowers in the mud. This is worth self-comfort!</p>
<h3>The Hunter (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>Usually, it felt like just a moment to reach the Gurbantunggut Mountains, but today it seems the further I go, the further it gets. I've been walking for ages and still can't see a shadow of the Gurbantunggut Mountains. What's wrong? It must be that the horse is running too slow! Torgut Nalhar was furious! He reached for the whip on his belt, but it was empty. He was in too much of a hurry and forgot to bring the whip, which brought a little regret. This made him even angrier! He twisted his body and punched the horse's rump hard with his fist:</p>
<p>Damn it! You're deliberately messing with me!</p>
<p>The horse threw its hooves wide and galloped swiftly as if taking flight. Its pure white, spotless short hair was soaked with sweat, and it exhaled hot air from its mouth, panting and using all its strength.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, and Torgut Nalhar's eyes followed the sound. In the distance, a group of people were coming from the north of Bogda Feng, all on horseback. Torgut Nalhar stopped his horse and looked carefully. They were all carrying weapons, like a band of bandits, running towards him. Torgut Nalhar felt uneasy. If bandits really caught him, there would be no chance of survival.</p>
<p>The best of the thirty-six tactics is to flee! He made up his mind and spurred his horse to run. Gunshots continued to ring out behind him.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>The horse stumbled and fell. This was more dangerous than a bullet entering Torgut Nalhar's chest! Torgut Nalhar dismounted and stood still, facing the approaching horsemen, arms outstretched, standing as if he had lost consciousness, waiting for the judgment of fate.</p>
<p>Coldness sprayed from the snowy ground, encroaching on the Alag Mountain plain. Every cell in Torgut Nalhar's body was being toyed with by the cold. The pure white horse lay on the snow, and it was almost impossible to tell what was horse and what was snow. The horse's panting mingled with Torgut Nalhar's faint breathing, and the sun stared intently at Torgut Nalhar's furrowed brow.</p>
<p>Torgut Nalhar hung his head, his eyes blurred, as if he had been sculpted by the cold onto the snow.</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>When Torgut Nalhar looked up, the fear instantly shattered and disappeared in his heart! It turned out that these people were all soldiers of the Bayin King's bandit suppression army.</p>
<p>Before he could speak, someone grabbed him:</p>
<p>See where you can escape now!</p>
<p>The color immediately drained from Torgut Nalhar's face, and he stared wide-eyed in terror:</p>
<p>You've mistaken me for someone else. I'm a hunter from Kamu Luto!</p>
<p>Another man with a beard approached Torgut Nalhar and shouted:</p>
<p>Bastard! You stole Lama Laiyin's livestock and won't admit it! We'll see if you confess today. You don't need anything else; the horse you're riding is Lama Laiyin's!</p>
<p>Torgut Nalhar looked up at the sky, tears streaming down his face, and said nothing, knowing that arguing would be a waste of words.</p>
<p>Three or four young men tied Torgut Nalhar's back, and two men with sabers dragged him away.</p>
<p>The sky was clear, the ground was snow-white, and the horse was pure white and spotless. Only humanity was impure. Sabers, purple robes, yellow jackets, horses of all colors, and Torgut Nalhar's heart!</p>
<p>On the vast, boundless plain, the white, crystalline snow covered all the dust and dirt. Horseshoes left tracks in the snow, and the cold branded people's faces. In this empty plain, silence drove away the wind and all sounds. At this moment, only the sound of hooves and panting, sabers and daggers, broke through the defenses of silence, using commotion to resist the cold.</p>
<p>Victory appeared on the face of every soldier, the dark purple faces radiating the greatness of the Khalkha people! Torgut Nalhar was no longer a hunter at all; he had simply disgraced the hunters! How could he have lost his resistance, with no trace of the Khalkha spirit!</p>
<p>The horseshoes disappeared under the snow, and the men dismounted, surrounding Torgut Nalhar to see Lama Laiyin.</p>
<p>But someone had already been sent there to deliver a message:</p>
<p>The Living Buddha has instructed that the horse thief be caught and killed without being brought to him.</p>
<p>Torgut Nalhar couldn't even squeeze out any tears. Others had already announced his crimes, and then they would carry out the death penalty.</p>
<p>Living Buddha, take me to heaven!</p>
<p>Torgut Nalhar knelt straight and still, praying, closing his eyes and waiting for the final outcome.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a storm rose, and the snow on the ground was swept up, rustling. The snow on the yurt was blown to the ground by the wind, the horses neighed, the Khalkha people's blood boiled, and in a burst of shouts, Torgut Nalhar's blood splattered on the snow.</p>
<p>Lama Laiyin knelt before the Buddha and prayed:</p>
<p>May my Buddha bless Torgut Nalhar to ascend to heaven; his sins have been atoned for.</p>
<p>The wind howled, the snow flew, and the Mongolian plain was immersed in cold. (The End)</p>
<h3>Eating (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>"Hey, tell me, why is this rice always so bad?"</p>
<p>I saw him staring greedily at my cigarette, which really surprised me. While guarding it, I casually said:</p>
<p>"Who knows? I'm hungry, just eat it, why ask?"</p>
<p>"No, I mean, this rice is from..."</p>
<p>I saw that he hadn't finished speaking, and he moved a step closer to me. His starving look made me have to be even more cautious. I held the cigarette butt in my palm with my fingers and replied casually:</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it..."</p>
<p>"Look!" Helplessly, he pointed a finger at a classmate on the horizontal bar, doing cartwheels. "Ha, another one!" He simply shouted at him. Immediately, the classmates watching around the horizontal bar, with their mouths open, laughed and echoed:</p>
<p>"Good, another one!"</p>
<p>The classmate with the rough face on the iron bar was flashing a pair of burning eyes. I saw that he was actually very hungry. However, in the cheers of the crowd, a surge of heroic spirit suddenly adorned his brow. His face flushed, and his blue veins bulged. He said "ha" and I was worried that he would pour out all his breastfeeding strength. But he already had his feet towards the sky and his bald head towards the ground. In the blink of an eye, he had flipped a round somersault around the round iron bar. Everyone seemed to be watching with interest, and some seemed to feel that this hungry fool should just turn out even his breastfeeding strength, so they slipped out and shouted:</p>
<p>"Good, another one!"</p>
<p>Then another round somersault. By the time of the third "another one", the cigarette butt in my palm suddenly left my fingers. Turning around, I saw that the classmate next to me had already stuffed the cigarette butt in his mouth and jumped into the crowd.</p>
<h3>On Poetry and Emotion</h3>
<p>— Liu Bing</p>
<p>Some poets have said: "Express your emotions completely; that is where poetry lies." Although we cannot fully agree with this statement, "art - poetry is the use of concrete images to express thoughts and feelings," especially poetry that expresses the highest emotions, its inseparable connection with emotion is very obvious.</p>
<p>Recently, some poets have written poems like this - poems without emotion. We all know that art is one of the means of spiritual connection between people. The higher the emotion expressed in a work of art, the more it can arouse the possibility of spiritual connection. Conversely, if the art given cannot convey the author's spirit to the reader, the work loses its value. A poem without emotion is like a skeleton without marrow, a news report in rhyming lines.</p>
<p>However, we must also note that in the society we live in, the things we see, the things we hear, and all kinds of facts can stir our emotions. Do all these emotions have the value of being expressed in poetry? We can say affirmatively, no!</p>
<p>Regarding this point, Ruskin once said: "A maiden can sing about lost love, but a miser cannot sing about lost money." He also said: "Regarding the emotion that grips you tightly, this emotion is sung by the poet, actively and in the true sense. Ask yourself if it can move him? If it can, this emotion is good; if it cannot be sung, then only the ridiculous aspect gives emotion, and that emotion is low."</p>
<p>Here, it clearly tells us the reason why not all emotions have the value of being expressed in poetry. For example, a miser losing money also has his own inner emotional flow. Why can't he sing about it? Clearly, it is because it is useless for connection between people.</p>
<p>How do we determine which emotions are worth expressing? This is not only determined by the degree of burning excitement of the poet, but also by the needs of real society. Not long after the May Fourth Movement, romantic songs of love were favored by people, but after the May 30th Movement, they were despised by those who loved them. At that time, violent, passionate, and shouting emotions were sung by people.</p>
<p>At the same time, this includes the poet's artistic view - worldview. For example, the emotions of a leisured poet about singing about unrequited love will inevitably be spat upon by the working masses. Conversely, singing about positive emotions will inevitably be despised by the leisured.</p>
<p>Finally, I will use the words of Mori Yama Kei as the conclusion of this article:</p>
<p>"First, the thing that has value in being expressed in poetry is always the need of a certain society. All poets base that need on the poet's worldview and the crucible of emotion, and express it in poetry. Second, therefore, the more the poet's crucible of emotion can boil for the task of realizing the historical progress of society, the more the value of that emotion will be increased when expressed in poetry."</p>

<h3>Customs Gold Plummets, Gold Market Weakens Initially But Then Firms Up, Forward Discount Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>The gold market was initially weak but then firmed up yesterday, resulting in a stable outcome. There were no special stimuli throughout the day. Although sentiment was calm, the sharp drop in customs gold made it difficult to rise despite the desire to do so. Later, the exchange market stabilized, allowing buying interest to recover. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US rose, the forward silver price in Montreux rose slightly, and the exchange rate was flat. The price of gold in London fell by two pence, and the French franc turned slightly stable. The off-market pre-trading opened, initially calling out 47.8 yuan. Buyers maintained their positions at the low, and it immediately rose, rising to around 50 yuan. The Central Bank's posted rates were revealed, with the British pound rising by 1.25 and the US dollar rising by 0.25. The customs gold unit plunged by 1.6%, and the gold standard price fell to 967.2 yuan, showing slight weakness. The market opened low in the morning, and after opening, it rose once to above the 50 yuan mark. However, due to the continued easing of spot foreign exchange, sellers continued to be active and the price fell. Although it recovered slightly after falling, HSBC's posted rates were revealed, with the British pound rising by 0.25 and the US dollar rising by 0.5 yuan. Selling interest was slightly boosted, and banks also sold out and moved downstream. However, due to the continuous rise of buyers, they bought together, the table was narrow, and gradually broke through the 50 yuan mark. Eventually, the exchange market was not uniform, and large players took advantage of the high to supply, and the rising momentum was temporary. Soon, it turned weak again. The balance tax on silver was revealed to be unchanged. Although it had little impact, the trading was clear and flat. After that, the overall situation was mediocre and lacked special changes, hovering around 9 yuan. Later, relying on low-price support, the exchange market had stabilized, and suppliers were waiting and watching. Buyers were excited, and the afternoon closing recovered to above 50 yuan. The uptrend in the market was still stable, and the floating multi-force lifted, and the trend suddenly became hot. Large players also slightly purchased and rose. Eventually, banks continued to sell, the rising momentum was blocked, and sellers took action, gradually lowering the price after rising. However, the initial report of shrinking silver in India still had the possibility of rising, but Sassoon continued to sell, and banks also had a selling appetite. The underlying potential in the exchange market was still loose, gradually moving downstream. The first report of rising silver in India once turned weak, but because the transaction volume was limited, buyers maintained their positions at the low, and the final presentation was stable. The market situation throughout the day was mediocre, the transaction volume was also small, and the trend entered a spiral again. The discount on forward contracts yesterday was eliminated by the bank's demand for cash collateral, and the discount also shrank. The day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 949.1 yuan, a decrease of 2.4 yuan compared to the previous closing. Heng Yu and Fu Yu were progressive, rising to 50.3 yuan. The exchange market was still strong, with spot sterling at 1 shilling, 5 pence, 0.625, and the US dollar at 36.3125 yuan for settlement. Fu Xing Yong, Yi Feng Yong, Ding Kang, Zhen Tai, and Da Fa Yong, Heng Tai, etc., sold bars, retreating to 48.3 yuan. Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Heng Yu, and Fu Xing Yong and Hong Li collected bars, rising to 9.1 yuan. It was predicted that HSBC's posted rates would be revealed, with the British pound rising by 0.25 and the US dollar increasing by half a yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, and Da Fa Yong, Da De Cheng, Da Fa Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and Yuan Mao Yong sold bars, falling back to 7.6 yuan. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Da Chang Xiang, Chang Da, Zhao Feng Chang, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhen Tai, etc., bought in succession, gradually rising to 50.8 yuan.

Banks continued to sell out, and Da Fa Yong, Heng Tai, and Yuan Mao Yong slightly entered, and the situation was still fixed. It once rose to 9.5 yuan. Fu Xing Yong and Da De Cheng sold off, retreating to 8.4 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong took advantage of the low to buy wildly, and Sheng Da also collected, and it rose to above 9 yuan. Da De Cheng took advantage of the high to sell slightly, and Fu Yu sold again, retreating to 8.2 yuan. After entering, the bank's selling appetite was slightly fixed, and buyers in the market turned prosperous. Zhao Feng Chang, Da De Cheng, Tian Feng, Fu Xing, Yuan Chang Yong, etc., all entered. Although Da Fa Yong, Fu Yu, and Yu Qing Yong sold, the demand exceeded the supply, and it gradually rose. Until the afternoon closing, it was 950.7 yuan. After the closing, Heng Chang Yong, etc., sold bars and it was slightly flat. Checking the highest price during the day was 953.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 947.6 yuan, with a difference of 5.8 yuan. The result was a slight increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was the Central Bank's gold standard price, which retreated to 967.2 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 15 yuan lower, which was about 8 yuan less than the previous closing. The registered price for February was 939 yuan, and the price for March was 951 yuan. The morning water supplement was 929 yuan, and the afternoon water supplement was 930 yuan. Red gold was about 3 yuan lower than the forward standard, at 946.1 yuan. The spot market was calm, and the forward discount was slightly lower. The situation was slightly fixed. Tianjin goods were about the same price as the forward standard, and there was a lack of supply, so there was no transaction. After the forward exchange of cash collateral by various banks in succession caused a major surge in prices, the market yesterday turned calm, and the discount was slightly cheaper. Large short positions initially wanted to offer 11.5 yuan, but refused scattered positions, so Bing Xing offered Heng Yu 14 bars at 12 yuan, Fu An 7 bars at 11.8 yuan, and Heng Yu offered Ding Tai 14 bars at only 10.05 yuan. Later, Qing Fa Yong offered Chun Yuan Yong 84 bars at 11.5 yuan, and Chun Yuan Yong offered Heng Yu 63 bars at 11.3 yuan. The trend seemed to turn stable. There were only 3,080 February strips left, with a total of 18 long parties and 26 short parties.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were sluggish again. In summary, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Shun Mao, Zhao Feng Chang, Shen Kang, Ri Chang, Qing Fa Yong, Yuan Kang Xiang, Sheng Da, Fu Sheng Yong, and Da De Cheng were on the buying side. Fu Xing Yong, Da Fa Yong, Zheng Chang, Yong Li, Yi Cheng, Rui Xing, Yu Qing Yong, and Bing Xing were on the selling side. Yuan Chang Yong, Fu Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, and Tong Tai Chang first sold and then bought. Heng Yu, Heng Chang Yong, and Tong Fu first bought and then sold.

The Guang Gang Sheng Da slightly entered, and Heng Xing was flat. The total number of transactions on the day was 15,120 in the first session and only 8,253 in the second session. The total number of March period chips was 21,903, with a total of 51 long parties and 62 short parties.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange eases slightly, then recovers.</p>

The Central Bank's posted rates were revealed, with the British pound rising by 0.125 and the US dollar rising by 0.25. The psychology of Chinese merchants was normal, and the spot price continued to strengthen after the opening. Banks also sold. HSBC's posted rates were revealed, with the British pound rising by 0.25 and the US dollar rising by half a yuan. Although it showed signs of easing, the overall situation was still flat due to Chinese merchants maintaining their positions at low prices. The balance tax on silver was revealed to be unchanged. After that, the process was mediocre, but because banks still had supply, the trend was spiraling. HSBC slightly tightened the forward sterling rate, and the underlying potential seemed tight at noon. In the afternoon, the psychology of Chinese merchants was difficult to improve, but the situation was still flat because banks continued to sell at high prices. Sassoon's later selling, although slightly relaxed, was still maintainable. Indian silver first shrank and then rose, with little impact. In the end, although the British intention to sell was strong, the Bank of Belgium was still buying, and the process was still fixed. The closing selling price for the near term, the British pound at 1 shilling, 5 pence, 875, and the US dollar at 36.125 yuan, compared to the previous closing, the British pound and the US dollar each eased by 0.0625. The appetites of Chinese merchants were mixed between buying and selling, and there was a lack of wholesale entry and exit. Although Sassoon sold, the selling appetite was normal, as was the case with Datong. The day's transactions are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Money remains tight, and the discount rate is unchanged.</h3>
<p>In the financial market, due to the approach of the end of the year, most colleagues mutually settle in and out in order to end the year. Various transactions have gradually entered a state of stagnation. Even if there are one or two, it is only a transfer procedure. In addition, the market is even more depressed this year, and it is difficult to collect money, resulting in a more sluggish situation. Yesterday's foreign dismantling, both morning and afternoon, was still 8 points, which was the same as the previous few days, and the water addition at the beginning was over 5 points, and then it was changed to 2 points. The atmosphere of dismantling bills was even more depressed. It is estimated that more than 800,000 were transferred in the morning market, more than 400,000 were new transactions, more than 300,000 were transacted in the afternoon market, more than 500,000 were transacted in the small general meeting, more than 500,000 were redeemed in foreign pledge transactions, more than 800,000 were newly made, more than 700,000 were recovered in banknote transactions, and in terms of issuance, there were more than 900,000 circulating bonds, more than 1.2 million unmarked bonds, more than 900,000 cash receipts, more than 900,000 remittances from various routes, a source of 300,000 from passenger routes, a selling appetite of 250,000, and bank collection and settlement, including foreign banks' collection and settlement of bill funds totaling more than 3.2 million, various remittance pledge miscellaneous funds collected and settled more than 4.5 million, telegraphic transfer funds more than 600,000, foreign exchange settlement funds collected and settled more than 1.5 million, year-end settlement funds collected and settled more than 15.8 million, special remittance funds more than 800,000, and delivery from the warehouse of 500,000.

<h3>Hao Yang slightly popular, copper coins extended.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign dollars were 842 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous day, and only 2,000 jiao were traded in the morning market, and there were no transactions in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign dollars increased by 1.5 yuan in the morning market to 756 yuan, and continued to increase by 2 yuan in the afternoon market, changed to 758 yuan, resulting in an increase of 3.5 yuan compared to the previous day. 165,000 jiao were traded in the morning market, and 90,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 310,000 wen, an increase of 500 wen compared to the previous day, and the transaction amount was 43,400 yuan, equivalent to 14,000 foreign dollars.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>January Public Bonds Hampered by the Environment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, January 29th, was the settlement date for the January futures contracts at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The total settlement amount was 41,140,000 yuan. Among this, brokers settled 22,770,000 yuan through mutual account transfers, while 18,370,000 yuan was settled at the exchange. This amount is not insignificant, and the off-exchange settlement amount is not included. This shows that although credit is tight, the public's faith in government bonds remains strong. The majority of sellers were from the financial sector, while the buyers were mostly small groups and individual investors. Since the market downturn, various enterprises have become unviable, and the closure of large and small businesses and small banks has been frequently reported. Therefore, idle funds have actually increased, and most investors have concentrated on government bonds, seeking their stable returns. If the environment can be somewhat stabilized, bond prices may still tend to rise. The January futures market opened on November 29th of last year. The initial market prices were 73.5 yuan for Disbandment Bonds and 55.5 yuan for Salt Tax Bonds. At that time, due to the increasingly close cooperation between the Southwest factions and the unquestioned passage of the Fifth Plenary Session, the market price on December 3rd rose to 76.5 yuan for Disbandment Bonds and 57.8 yuan for Salt Tax Bonds. Subsequently, due to the gradual tightening of credit, the daily increase in foreign exchange rates, and the resignation of Huang Fu, etc., the financial sector sold off daily, and arbitrage trading did not occur. On December 17th, there was another slight decline, with Disbandment Bonds falling to 72.85 yuan and Salt Tax Bonds to 53.8 yuan, a difference of about 4 yuan. This high and low fluctuation lasted only two weeks. Afterwards, foreign exchange rates declined from high levels, the Flat Market Committee transported silver back to Shanghai from Hong Kong, and the postal communication problem was resolved. The market price gradually returned to normal. In between, rumors of currency devaluation and inflation caused a period of market turmoil, with erratic fluctuations. Recently, the issue of the Chahar conflict has caused significant changes in market prices, but they have risen and fallen accordingly without much impact. Considering that the financial sector sold a lot, but buyers were still very active, the total transaction volume for one month was 38,022,500 yuan. The settlement, account transfer, and total transaction volumes are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>According to the report from New China Trading Company, yesterday (28th), the New York stock market was sluggish and lifeless. Traders were unwilling to trade due to the New York dockworkers' strike and the Supreme Court's anticipated ruling on the Gold Clause case on February 4th. At the same time, after the extension of automotive industry regulations, there is a risk of a strike in the automotive industry, which would affect the steel industry. However, brokers who had shorted in anticipation of an unfavorable ruling may engage in covering in the second half of the week, so the market may have a slight rebound. The bond market was mixed, small exchange stocks fell, and Chicago wheat showed a downward trend. Sellers sold due to the confusion in the monetary situation. The total daily volume was 690,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>

<h3>In the Gold Market, Only Retail Investors Engage in Direct Transactions</h3>
<p>The opening of the bid yarn market in the morning was generally weak. The possibility of a decline this month, due to the sluggish overseas cotton market, the market has not been affected in any way, in fact, most of the long-term large households absorbed the amount and closed it, and the chips on the table did not surge. The price of various months rose and fell each other, rising and falling by one or two points. The market in the afternoon was still as calm as ever. The transactions made were mostly floating households who were leveling off for the New Year. The near month rose one or two points, and the far month was flat.

<p>The cotton market, which has been rising for days, is gradually declining for Indian cotton, and American cotton is also showing weakness. The local people's hearts have not been hit, because the end of the lunar year is approaching, and most of them are preparing to end, and the transactions made are all concluded, and new business has long disappeared, and the market is even less. Yesterday was the last day of the futures cotton market, and the market price did not rise or fall.

<h3>Zheng Biao Only Drops by a Small Amount</h3>

The calculated price of foreign cotton is cheaper, but the Shanghai market is still stagnant, which is actually related to the chips. The long and short large accounts have already been leveled off, and the middle month has fallen by five points.

<h3>American and Indian Cotton Bulls Close Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, because the bulls closed their positions, foreign merchants sold out, the Liverpool news was not good, and the Gold Clause case was uncertain, resulting in the exchange rate being irregular. Each month fell six to twelve pounds. The amount sold was not very much, but the demand was very poor. Except for those who bought in on the dips to set the market price, there was a strange shortage of buyers. Afterwards, due to short covering and the weakness of the gold yuan, a part of the rebound was discovered. Spot sales were sluggish and the closing was flat. It is estimated that spot fell by five pounds, and futures fell by nine to eleven pounds. The British cotton market was flat, with spot falling by one point and futures falling by four or five points. Indian cotton initially rose due to short covering and purchases by European exporters, but then weakened due to profit-taking by bulls. It is estimated that Pingguoer was unchanged, Aomula fell by two rupees, and Bairoxi fell by two point two five rupees. Original Record Left (Telegraph on the 28th)</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Remarks by the President of an American University</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Houston, USA, 25th. Dr. Wei Zhuoming, President of West China Union University, today declared that China cannot continue to allow itself to be slaughtered by Japan's aggressive actions. It should rely on its own strength to resist, and so on.</p>
<p>I do not know what the purpose of the president's advocacy of such remarks is. Is it merely to encourage China to resist Japan? If that is the case, then the president's words are rather ridiculous. Japan's aggression against China is not only a matter for China and Japan; it is a matter that concerns all countries in the world, but with varying degrees of severity. The heavy losses suffered by us from Japan's direct slaughter are self-evident, but do other countries not have any relation to this matter? But the president said, "Our country (referring to the United States) can accept Japan's policy in pursuit of peace, but China should rely on its own strength to resist." This view of the Sino-Japanese problem as a local issue in the Far East, unrelated to countries around the world, is in line with the American's long-held Monroe Doctrine: "Everyone sweeps the snow from his own doorstep and does not care about the frost on others' roofs."</p>
<p>But the president also said, "Japan's aggression against China is obviously a preliminary step to drive the white race out of Asia." If so, then the president recognizes that Japan's encroachment on China is not just a local problem in the Far East, but has a global presence. But the president also said that the United States Navy is not protecting the Philippines and Hawaii, and that it would be easy for Japan to seize these two places, thus indicating that the United States cannot help and can stay out of the matter, already revealing the intention that other countries should come forward to intervene.</p>
<p>The president also said, "Japan's recent ambition is to find a market for selling Japanese goods. China advocates open doors, while Japan advocates the Monroe Doctrine in Asia." Advocating open doors means that China is a market for many countries; advocating the Monroe Doctrine means that China is a market for Japan alone. It does not matter whether China is someone else's market. Regardless, it is an undeniable fact that China's national power is still unable to resist the Japanese at this time. Even if it were possible, on the one hand, we would be resisting for the sake of our own country, and on the other hand, we would be resisting for the sake of the great powers, which would bring little benefit to our own country.</p>
<p>In short, the world today is truly as the ancients said, "Move one hair, and the whole body is affected." The situation in Europe is no different from that in the Far East. Germany's abandonment of alliances, regardless of everything, and its desperate hard work are no different from Japan. However, France's national strength is far more substantial than that of China, but France is unable to contain its powerful neighbors' tyranny. It must rely on the strength of Britain and Italy, as well as the smaller countries, to control Germany's power. Thus, any country that wants to resist a tyrannical neighbor must rely on allied countries. It cannot be accomplished by a single country, as can be seen in this example.</p>
<h3>Elegy</h3>
<p>— Qi Wu</p>
<p>It seemed I was discovered only when I reached the third hall.</p>
<p>The situation in the hall was different. Did you think it would be even more desolate here? Quite the opposite! Like a large gathering, all the members of the clan were present. Although a row of white mourning colors made people feel uncomfortable, as if a stone were hanging from their hearts, it was noisy here. This restless atmosphere seemed somewhat inconsistent with the fact that my father had passed away.</p>
<p>Because I was eager to see my aunt, the maid told me she was in the bedroom, so I went upstairs.</p>
<p>My aunt was sleeping on the bed with her clothes on, sound asleep. Was this widow's grief, in her dreams, unaware that all the housework had not been properly arranged by her uncle?</p>
<p>When I came downstairs again, I saw the noisy heads clearly. Since my grandfather's death, I had never seen such "liveliness." Many familiar faces had increased by at least one-third. In their noisy state, my sudden appearance did not attract their attention, but my mother and younger brother called out to me from a dark corner. Before I could open my mouth, my mother quietly warned me with her eyes:</p>
<p>"Listen!"</p>
<p>Indeed, I had stepped into unfamiliar territory. Everyone, every face, every action, every word, seemed to be cut off from me, and my mother was saying that to me. Rather than speculating, I sat down in a chair in the corner, like an audience waiting for the curtain to rise.</p>
<p>A jumble of words reached my ears, but you couldn't tell who was speaking, except for a rough voice that shouted, "What's all the noise about? Speak properly!" Hearing his words, you could tell that the person was so forthright, like a swarm of flies chasing after something rotten. There was no intention to insult here, but do you know what they were arguing about? The inheritance, which was as welcome to the swarm of flies as something rotten!</p>
<p>I understood this "lively" situation. I lowered my head and retreated to the second hall. My uncle's appearance alone in the center was so terrible that it made me wonder if there really was a soul after death. He had been diligent and thrifty all his life, but the cost of his medical treatment was so great that he couldn't even enjoy</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>the pleasure of listening to the radio. He was worn out by "housework" and died. I can say that with certainty.</p>
<p>I said earlier that this mansion was maintained by my uncle, this weak pillar, bearing the entire weight. Usually, no one would step forward to say a word about even the smallest trivial matters, and that one word could determine whether or not the "matter" was settled. As an uncle, he did not fall ill from being too diligent in housework, but what was it that pulled him back to his hometown when he wanted to listen to the radio? He was the master of this mansion, and he could not waste the ancestral inheritance too much. He had to set a good example for others. We don't ask whether spending money on medical treatment was wasting the ancestral property, but that was not the biggest reason. He was disregarding his own weak strength and wanted to support the permanent existence of this mansion. He could not sit idly by and watch no one stand up for this large clan!</p>
<p>But this mansion was eventually collapsing. Unexpectedly, there were so many ultra-"lively" people who would take charge of the overall situation because my uncle did not have a son!</p>
<p>I cautiously raised my head and surveyed those familiar faces. I wanted to cry, but there were no tears! (The End)</p>
<h3>Longing and Terror</h3>
<p>— Xue Hong</p>
<p>Time has taken away twenty-one years from me without any hesitation. I once floated through these past journeys, as if I were sitting on a train passing through a distant road in a short period of time. With my eyes open, I looked at the lush branches along the road, as well as the vast, verdant, and fertile fields in the distance, and my heart was always filled with light laughter! My face was also always filled with a pleasant color. In the past journey, I also seemed to be riding an airplane soaring in the boundless sky. Although it was only for a moment, I did feel the joy of traveling: the light, sparkling, and beautiful clouds floated into the cabin window, making me confused and intoxicated; in the blue, clear sky and the vast, distant world, I looked up and down, feeling that I had reached a state of "forgetting myself" and "I am nothing"! The human world seemed to have nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>If it were possible, I would shout to the driver to slam on the train's engine; or I would prohibit the pilot of the plane from stopping the flight. Because at this time, I had taken all the scenery into my eyes and marveled at it, and I really didn't want to move forward to hurt my good eyesight!</p>
<p>If it were possible, I also wished the train or plane would hurry back and review my past journey again. Because I knew that my progress did not have any predetermined goals, my initial intention was just to play and just to try! Now I have had enough of this game and this attempt, and I can always savor and enjoy the past! What's more, the front is so unpredictable: maybe the train will pass through a barren desert, drill into a deep cave! Or encounter unexpected obstacles and derail! Maybe the plane will encounter a violent gale and capsize, encounter a misty fog and lose its direction, or suddenly run out of engine oil and fall!</p>
<p>However, in fact, the cruel and ruthless "time", it stubbornly insisted on me moving forward, it would not let me retreat, it grabbed me so tightly! I repeatedly looked back reluctantly, but the further I looked, the further it became! So I closed my eyelids and thought carefully and silently – batches of scattered memories, vaguely and in groups, filled my heart. Is it always possible to get only by greedily reminiscing about the past? "Impossible"! It answered me like this. It also told me to stare at the front, because there is still a "future" ahead!</p>
<p>Staring at the "future" is too difficult for me! My weak vision cannot penetrate this current vague "future"! I only see a vast expanse of white! Abyss, jagged rocks, vines, stubborn stones, and unpredictable and terrible attacks, can I cross them? Can I resist them?············</p>
<p>If what I have walked in the past is a flat and broad road, then what I will walk in the future will be a rugged and narrow path. I accidentally walked so many roads, and thinking about it was ignorant and absurd, and although I am still safe and sound today, I already feel very disheartened! What's more, once I discovered the unpredictability and danger of the future, how could I not be frightened?</p>
<p>Ah! The future! The future is terrifying! Even if someone says the future is bright!</p>
<h3>Work No. 3 from the Songjiang Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition: Mr. Song Junyang's Calligraphy</h3>
<h3>Work No. 4: Mr. Huang Zongxiang's Recent Work</h3>
<h3>Melancholy Lilac</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Facing the back window of the house of worship, there is a small private garden in the neighborhood. In the early morning, the crisp chimes of the church are rippling in the misty air, and each flower in the garden is bathed in crystal-cracked heavy dew. I stand in front of the window, listening to the gentle music-like chimes, and looking at each flower swaying with a sleepy and charming attitude, swaying lightly in the slight morning breeze.</p>
<p>It is a poetic, illusory, and heart-pleasing poetic morning!</p>
<p>For this garden, which is so gorgeously decorated by nature, I can use more time and more</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>intoxicated mood to appreciate it. Especially unforgettable is the scene every evening, when the faint afterglow of the setting sun faintly strokes the towering spire of the church, stroking the quiet and beautiful little garden, so lingering as if reluctant to leave. The meaning at this time is even a bit close to the mysterious.</p>
<p>Every day, whether in the evening or in the early morning, I make sure to come to this window and linger for a while, and I have become accustomed to it for many days. Because standing there and looking at such scenery, the depressed mind will often relax immediately. But I often feel a disappointment. This garden, which is planted with all kinds of flowers, is uniquely lacking the light and graceful shadow of lilac. I wonder why the owner of the garden simply doesn't want lilac. Although I admire this garden for having all kinds of colorful flowers, I don't like peach blossoms that are too gorgeous, and roses that are too gorgeous. The strong fragrance will instead make people feel breathless. What I like is the purple lilac, which is neither too gorgeous nor too faint, like a slender, elegant, and silent girl.</p>
<p>However, I have never seen the lilac that I want.</p>
<p>One early morning, as usual, I walked to the back window again, looking with more meticulous scrutiny than usual, hoping to find it. After looking at it several times, when my sight reached the place where the grape trellis used to be, the shadow of the West cluster of lilac suddenly reflected into my eyes. If the grape trellis were not removed, the lilac would bloom and wither silently for the rest of its life.</p>
<p>Lilac can now "smile in the sun, right? But no, because in the long days of the past, it was buried under the grape trellis, without the nourishment of the sun and the cultivation of dew. It has made it as unsmiling as a patient, with its face shrouded in the dark clouds of deep sorrow. Infinite melancholy surrounds the small branches and leaves, and the small soul? The color of youth is withering unnamed in the bleak destiny. The miserable body droops weakly to the ground.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but become inexplicably melancholy for the melancholy of lilac.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but curse that grape trellis on behalf of lilac. It made it spend dark days without sunshine or happiness in silence, and it also made it silently approach withering without ever having a brilliant youth. All the unfortunate encounters were all given by the abominable grape trellis. Without the grape trellis, it would have appeared in this garden more happily and vividly than its other companions.</p>
<p>Maybe it would have been appreciated by the owner. But everything was destroyed by the grape trellis.</p>
<p>And I can only stare at your gloomy and haggard shadow from afar on this window, sighing for your misfortune.</p>
<p>No one would have imagined that on another early morning, just as I was walking to the window, suddenly two young girls were walking on the pebble road, each picking a handful of fresh flowers, holding them in their hands, some red and some purple. When I moved my eyes to the position of lilac, the purple lilac had lost its melancholy shadow. Only a pile of loose soil remained. Only then did I realize that it had been placed in the hand of that girl. It looked a little bleak for a moment.</p>
<p>Being taken away by a young girl may get better treatment once, carefully supplying it to a gilded clean bottle, but tomorrow it will inevitably wither very quickly. Tomorrow there will be fresh ones to replace the withered ones of yesterday. But the melancholy lilac, your melancholy shadow, will never fade in my memory. ······</p>
<h3>Storytelling Venue</h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Since coming to Beiping, although not many days have passed, I have been to the storytelling venue several times. The reason is that the place is so quiet and cold. When night falls, sitting alone in a room like an ancient temple, listening quietly to the sound of the clapper vibrating in the night sky, and the cries of hawkers, ······ it becomes even more desolate and silent, which makes people unbearable. Therefore, listening to storytelling has gradually become my only job when I am bored.</p>
<p>The storytelling venue in this place is very old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Usually, in a hall of about one or two zhang square, a dirt platform more than a foot high and five or six feet wide is built against one side of the wall, with a table, two chairs, and a tripod drum stand placed on it. Next to the platform, there is a seat for boiling water and selling tea. Under the platform, six or seven tea tables and more than a dozen long benches are tightly arranged. This is the complete equipment of a complete storytelling venue. If you accidentally walk past the door before the show starts and peek inside, you may not believe that such a place is an entertainment venue. Not to mention other things, just take a tour of various "modern" entertainment venues and then come back here to take a look, and you will feel as if time has been pulled back one or two hundred years.</p>
<p>During the day, this place is very deserted. Usually, there is only an old man with fluent speech sitting listlessly on the stage, telling stories of "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "Water Margin", ······ and other "big books". The audience is only a few job leavers and children. But when night falls, it becomes much more lively. At this time, the storytellers who take the stage are mostly young women. At the same time, when telling stories, there are also people playing the sanxian and erhu to accompany them. The books they tell are either about talented scholars and beautiful women, or about Wu Song fighting the tiger on Jingyang Ridge, Zhao Zilong rescuing the lord on Changban Slope, ······ and other heroic stories. Among the audience, there are old shop clerks, small vendors and coolies, and widowed old ladies, ······ Every time a story is sung, everyone holds their breath and stares intently, watching as if they are mesmerized. After a story is sung, someone walks down from the stage, holding a small bamboo basket in their hand, walks past one table after another, and asks the audience for money. The guests can take out one or two copper coins and throw them into the basket at will. No one will force them. However, the person who collects the money is very clever. Every time they collect money, if it does not meet the amount they expected, they will always say a lot of difficult words to the guests as if by magic, and then come again once, twice, ······ They will only stop asking when they can't ask any more. Or, if a cunning guest throws three or two copper coins at the pile of money in the basket with force, making a "sha ······" sound, then he will raise his voice and report to the person in charge on the stage: ×× table gave × hanging of money, making the other guests embarrassed to be too stingy with their own wallets. Therefore, if you are a regular customer and familiar with these tricks they play, you can spend one or two hours here with a dozen or so copper coins in your pocket; but, if you are a new customer, you have to spend at least one or two jiao a night.</p>
<p>A place of entertainment like this will naturally not attract the attention of the noble; but, its impact on the masses is not to be underestimated. I think that a group of artists who often shout "for the masses" in their mouths, if they are willing to take the trouble to come here and take a look, they will not cause trouble for themselves, right?</p>
<h3>Beggar</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yi from Tugenev</p>
<p>I was walking down the street... An elderly beggar stopped me.</p>
<p>His red, swollen eyes were filled with tears, his lips were turning blue, his clothes were ragged, his wounds were filthy... Ah, how terrible, poverty had eroded this unfortunate life!</p>
<p>He reached out a red, swollen, and filthy hand to me... He groaned, pleading for help.</p>
<p>So I searched my own pockets... No wallet, no watch, not even a handkerchief... I had nothing on me.</p>
<p>But the beggar waited... his outstretched hand trembling.</p>
<p>I was moved, confused, and firmly grasped his filthy, trembling hand, saying: "Friend, do not be disappointed; I have nothing at all, friend."</p>
<p>The beggar's red, swollen eyes stared at me, a smile now on his blue lips... He, too, gripped my hand tightly with his cold fingers.</p>
<p>"What, friend," he said softly, "even so, I must thank you, this is also a kind of charity, friend."</p>
<p>I understood, I too, had received charity from him.</p>
<h3>Movie Stage Coffee Shop</h3>
<p>— Jiang Manlang</p>
<p>The young man who teaches Japanese is from Tokyo, without father, mother, wife, or family. His studies were supported by others. (In Japan, there are many such examples; a capitalist or politician will support at least a few poor students.) Although he has now graduated from a specialized school, he has not yet found a job, but he still wants to have fun, spending whatever money he has on food and entertainment. This is probably the spirit of urban youth. The person who introduced him to me first told us about this habit, and if we want to learn a few more words, we can only exploit this weakness.</p>
<p>The first time, I went with him to Ginza to see a movie. The first movie was about a poor man and a child struggling to survive in the city, somewhat imitating Charlie Chaplin's bittersweet comedies (i.e., “Water Suicide”). Another was about a young man's suffering from love and life, and his suicide with a geisha. Japanese national character: courage, righteousness, enthusiasm, and narrow-mindedness. A spirit of going forward without looking back, even to death, can be seen here.</p>
<p>Regarding Tokyo's dance performances, we watched the Shochiku Girls' Opera's "Ode to the Night," "Rose," and "Paris" at the Shinjuku First Theater. The dazzling lights and luxurious extravagance were overwhelming. The number of dancers alone was one or two hundred. The sheer number, the gorgeous colors, and the sensual abundance were only meant to stimulate the audience; there was nothing else to appreciate. What was commendable was the speed of the stage setup, which was probably due to mechanization, because the stage could rotate.</p>
<p>The most popular dance star here is Tatsuko Mizunoe. Japanese women's magazines frequently feature her photos, life stories, and biographies. Women, in particular, are fond of her because she plays male roles best. This is similar to how Chinese people like Mei Lanfang's male impersonation of female roles. This kind of "sexual disguise" probably only exists in the most Confucian societies.</p>
<p>There are two types of coffee shops: one that purely sells coffee and food, and another that sells smiles. Because one of the gentlemen who came to Tokyo with me was a hedonist, he went to a "smile-selling" coffee shop in Osaka, sat for a while, and joked around, which cost six or seven yuan. I went with him again in Tokyo. The Japanese women's softness and the prostitutes' vulgarity were fully on display. As an objective observer, I felt that this was not heaven, but certainly not paradise. It could only be described as the crystallization of hell.</p>
<p>However, many students studying in Tokyo become addicted to this path, which is lamentable.</p>

<p>Beauty and longevity combined in one. Noble character and beautiful appearance. Subtle fragrance and sparse shadows are hard to describe. Light smile and soft voice are most charming. Only dreams linger in my mind. Drawing and imagining her true form. When will I hear celestial music under the moon? Occupying all of the vast spring in Jiangnan. She is pure jade bones and ice muscles. Searching for a smile along the eaves in the clear weather. Can she be the queen to be envied by all the flowers? Who can compare with her in this world? The fairy Chang'e is so pure and bright. Her heart for burying flowers is not clear enough. Do not say that there is no Lin Bu who understands her. Tell the poets to describe her carefully. She has a gentle and jade-like spirit. Seeing each other in a small room is even more dear. Silk sleeves and a gown are truly extraordinary. The bamboo curtain and desk are clean and dust-free. Holding her is truly a blessing of three lifetimes. Her frown and smile can add spring to all around. Diligently wipe the paper curtain and silver screen. The light of the flowers and treasures are clear and fresh. She is the one whose soul is broken in the tenth month of Jiangnan. My thoughts are as vast as the clouds. The noble recluse in the mountains finds it hard to sleep. On the pillow, I have wonderful thoughts of Luofu in spring. Transforming into a butterfly is truly a spiritual intention. I only feel infatuated with her when I see the Wild Goose. The secluded fragrance and unrestrained charm are unparalleled. Leaving behind a story of love in the world. Ke Meng's floating life is hard to make real.</p>

<p>Song of Changgan (Part 1) by Li Bai</p>
<p>My hair just covered my forehead, playing with flowers in front of the gate. My love came riding a bamboo horse,</p>
<p>circling the bed, playing with green plums. Living together in Changgan Village, as children, we were without suspicion.</p>
<p>At fourteen, I became your wife, my face shy, never opening up. I lowered my head to the dark wall,</p>
<p>no matter how many times you called, I would not respond. At fifteen, I began to smile, willing to be as dust and ashes with you.</p>
<p>Always cherishing the embrace-the-pillar promise, how could I ascend the Looking-for-Husband Terrace. At sixteen, you went on a long journey,</p>
<p>to the treacherous Qutang Gorge. The fifth month is not to be touched, the sound of monkeys wailing in the sky.</p>
<p>Footprints linger before the gate, one by one covered in green moss. The moss is too deep to sweep away,</p>
<p>falling leaves, early autumn wind. In the eighth month, butterflies come, flying in pairs in the west garden grass.</p>
<p>Moved by this, my heart is saddened, sitting and worrying about my fading beauty! Sooner or later I will go down to Sanba,</p>
<p>and send a letter home in advance. To greet you, I will not say it is far, I will go straight to Changfengsha.</p>

<h3>Prelude to the American Automobile Industry in 1935</h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>丨Refilling Old Capacity Will Increase Threefold丨</p>
<p>The raw materials for automobile manufacturing include steel, copper, lead, zinc, and other metals. Because the automobile manufacturing industry is developed in the United States, the annual consumption of the above-mentioned metals is very considerable. Taking tin as an example, the annual amount used for automobile manufacturing accounts for 25% of the normal annual tin production in the United States. Therefore, it is generally recognized that if the American automobile industry can revive, other industries will also benefit from it. According to the current situation, the automobile industry is indeed undergoing revival. In the near future, we will see significant progress. Both production and sales will increase significantly. Taking the facts as an example, it can prove that this is correct. Because the automobile production volume in 1934 has already told us that there is a significant improvement. As for 1935, needless to say, it will continue to move forward and head towards a bright road.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation and past experience, the driving forces that can influence the increase in automobile sales are roughly the following three points. (1) The reason for refilling old cars. People who have bought cars cannot be expected to never add new cars in their lifetime. Therefore, after a considerable period of a few years, a batch of new cars will be used to replace the old ones. (2) Due to the prosperity and improvement of various industries. We all know that the automobile industry and other industries have a mutually linked circular relationship. If all industries decline and the social economy is exhausted, the sales of automobiles will naturally be greatly affected. Conversely, if society shows prosperity and everyone has purchasing power, automobiles will undoubtedly sell well. It is also no problem for the factory to increase its revenue. (3) The reason for the federal government's allocation of funds to farmers. Farmers need cars no less than urban residents. They use cars and tractors to cultivate and improve their production efficiency. However, farmers naturally have no money to buy cars because of the decline of rural areas. For the sake of relief, the federal government allocated funds to them, so the sales of automobiles will naturally also increase. Whether other industries besides the automobile industry can continue to recover and improve without decline in 1935 is still unknown. Therefore, the second point mentioned above is not very reliable in terms of its impact on increasing automobile sales. We will leave it aside for now and only talk about the first and third points, which are inevitable. There is no doubt that they will affect the increase in automobile sales. These two reasons were very effective in 1934. As Claim's automobile report stated, the American automobile production in the autumn of 1934 totaled 696,851 units. This number is the largest production volume in the third quarter of each year since 1930. Because of various reasons, automobile sales in winter are relatively sluggish. It is also expected that the autumn season is better than the fourth quarter of each year. This quantity increased by 3.6% compared to the same period in 1933.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 1934, the sales of automobiles in the United States totaled 2,493,260 units, an increase of 18.2% compared to the same period in 1930. The production volume in the winter of 1934 was of course lower, as mentioned above. However, according to the estimates of powerful people, the total production volume for the year was about 2,778,000 units. This total increased by 12.2% compared to 1933, and decreased by 20.5% compared to 1930. Because the total production volume in that year was 3,510,178 units. It is not easy to say how much the recovery of various industries and the federal government's allocation of funds have increased automobile sales. However, the quantity of regular refilling of old cars can be calculated. There is continuous progress in the refilling of old cars. If old cars are not refilled for several years, the quantity will accumulate. Therefore, from this point alone, we can be optimistic. The average number of new private passenger cars and commercial vehicles sold in the United States in the past four years was 2,068,794 units. The average number in the previous five years was 3,546,130 units. What we should pay attention to here is that this five-year period includes the peak sales years of 1928 and 1929. However, in fact, the cars sold in those two years now need to be refilled. Unless the car owner is unable to add or replace new cars in this recessionary period due to poor economic conditions. There is also one more thing. In the past three years, there have been few car owners who have purchased new cars. The situation is the same for those who have purchased multiple cars. Therefore, the matter of refilling old cars is relatively certain.</p>
<p>According to the calculation of the American National Automobile Association, the lifespan of a car is currently about seven years and eight months. In 1929, it was six years and nine months. Even if we say that the average lifespan of a car is eight years, then the number of old cars that will expire in 1935 should be 7,000,000 units. This number will increase threefold compared to the estimated total production volume in 1934. Speaking of the existing number of automobiles in the United States, it has decreased by 2,700,000 units since 1930. Under the current circumstances, I am afraid that many car owners will still not be able to purchase new cars. However, even if we subtract the number of unregistered cars, the number of old cars to be refilled will still be more than twice that of 1933. If it is unreliable to say that the American automobile industry in 1935 will cope with all needs with 7,000,000 units, then its huge quantity of old cars to be refilled will of course be recognized by more people.</p>
<h3>The New Lineup of Standard Motors</h3>
<p>— Shadow Viewer</p>
<p>Firm Position, Excellent Products</p>
<p>(1) The Pressure of the Environment Approximately eighteen months ago, the directors of Standard Motors sat together to consider the 1934 business plan. They acknowledged that the revival of the automobile industry was imminent. The recessionary atmosphere of 1931 would become a thing of the past, and the sales of automobiles would increase in the transition from 1933 to 1934. Many car owners should have replaced their cars from 1932 or 1933, but for economic reasons, they did not purchase new vehicles. Therefore, after the situation improved, private car orders would suddenly become active. On the other hand, automobile manufacturing had undergone many improvements and new trends. Small engines could increase horsepower. In addition to increasing the speed of cars, gearbox shifting was also more convenient. Research and experimentation progressed simultaneously, making engine operation silent and smooth, without any inconvenience. Other improvements included the ability to handle uneven roads, reduced weight, elimination of wind resistance, and even touring cars possessed these advantages. The improvement of materials and the reduction of labor wages, both directly and indirectly, would increase vehicle sales.</p>
<p>(2) A Grand Plan In this situation, the board of directors of Standard Motors reached a resolution. Their various vehicles with "Nine Horsepower," small "Nine Horsepower," "Twelve Horsepower," "Sixteen Horsepower," and "Twenty Horsepower" engines were all excellent cars. They had considerable sales in the recession years. However, despite these vehicles being finely manufactured and sturdy, in the trend of automobile progress, they undoubtedly needed to be improved. Otherwise, there would be the possibility of failure and elimination. Therefore, they worked tirelessly. In the automotive market, the damage inflicted by the recession had not yet recovered. The factory had to work hard, and they purchased many new instruments and raw materials, and built new factories. Standard Motors was determined to work tirelessly under the will to revive the automobile industry.</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturing New Cars In September 1933, Standard Motors announced that the above-mentioned five types of completely renovated new cars had been fully completed. The engine styles and designs, car bodies, chassis, and transmissions were completely revamped. The accessories were complete. The launch of the new cars was earlier than expected. The success achieved after the launch of the 1934 Standard new cars exceeded the initial expectations of the board of directors when they decided on the new strategy. In terms of business, countless orders were soon received. Thereafter, sales continued to improve. In the social aspect, many people purchased a Standard new car. Until June 30, 1934, Standard had manufactured and sold more than 20,000 vehicles in the market.</p>
<p>(4) Owner's Testimonials From past experience, we know that every car factory, when manufacturing new cars, is cautious and careful, and conducts thorough inspections, hoping that the new cars will be free of defects after they are manufactured. However, occasional minor flaws are unavoidable. Therefore, once a new car is launched, some minor shortcomings will be discovered before twenty vehicles are produced. However, car owners, who are generally accustomed to criticizing, use these shortcomings as information to point out flaws. So, in fact, a perfect new car rarely receives good reviews at the beginning. Inconvenient movement of the sunroof, excessive angle when moving the gear lever, and poorly placed door buttons are all minor problems, but harsh critics insist on using them as good material for nitpicking. However, the Standard new cars, after their launch, did not have these minor problems at all. They were truly the most perfect new cars. The action, driving, luster, silence, comfort, and appearance were absolutely flawless. Therefore, after the new cars were launched, they received unexpectedly good reviews from general critics. Standard Motors' slogan "Manufacturing cars that society needs" is appropriate. Society needs such a car. This is the reason why the sales of Standard cars will increase day by day.</p>
<p>(5) Expansion of Scope These new cars had considerable success in 1934. The 1935 new cars retained their various advantages. There were many improvements in manufacturing. Basically, after a year of testing, people were very satisfied and there were no changes, because society had already proven them to be excellent. However, in addition to the above types, two new cars were added. One was a specially modified "Nine Straight" new car with a slightly longer wheelbase and a four-door sedan body. The other was the "Ten/Twelve Special Speed" new car. This new car completely occupied a new field. In terms of appearance, it was completely the same as the 1935 "Ten Horsepower" Standard new car, but inside, it possessed a special performance that would satisfy every traveler. The top speed could reach an average of 70 miles per hour. In terms of acceleration (which was the result of testing in various climates and on different roads), it could accelerate from a complete stop to 50 miles per hour in 16 seconds. What was especially mysterious was a specially made engine with a capacity of 1608 cubic centimeters, with dual carburetors and an aluminum cylinder head. Therefore, if we add up the old cars that Standard's 1935 new cars have successfully improved over the past year, and the completely new cars manufactured this year, there are the following types: (1) "Nine Horsepower" new car (two-door and four-door). (2) "Ten Horsepower" new car. (3) "Twelve Horsepower" new car. (4) "Ten/Twelve" Special Speed new car. (5) "Sixteen Horsepower" new car. (6) "Twenty Horsepower" new car.</p>
<p>The above are all British standard new cars, representing the products. In the coming year, the sales of the 1935 Standard new cars will undoubtedly exceed the record of 1934.</p>
<h3>Austin Sales Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Employing 19,000 Workers</p>
<p>According to news from the Austin factory, the number of workers currently employed by the factory has broken all previous records, with the current number being 19,000, an increase of more than 1,500 compared to a month ago. As for the reason for the increase in the number of people, it is naturally due to busy work. The reason for the busy work is due to the sharp increase in the sales of the globally renowned Austin cars. This is self-evident. According to the factory's products, the 7-horsepower and 10-horsepower four-cylinder new cars are in the greatest demand. Since the factory increased the number of people, the production volume has increased, which is sufficient to adapt to the growing demand. As of now, the sales of the small Austin new cars have exceeded 20% compared to the same period last year. The sales last year were already amazing, but now they have surpassed them, which is especially commendable.</p>
<h3>Dodge Factory Manufactures a Large Number of New Cars</h3>
<p>Orders Valued at 40 Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Detroit, USA, on January 28, orders for cars and trucks worth 40 million yuan have been delivered by Dodge dealers in various states to the special commissioners stationed in 25 cities by the factory. According to Mr. Vanderkie, General Manager of the Dodge Company's marketing department, the 1935 Dodge new cars have been exhibited in various cities.</p>
<h3>Ford's Success in the Finnish Rally</h3>
<p>From October 20 to 21 last year, in the first annual rally of the Finnish Automobile Club, Ford cars won twelve of the fifteen top prizes, and nine of them reached the finish line without any damage.</p>
<p>This trial was based on the Monte Carlo Rally. It started from various places in Finland and had to travel 850 miles to Helsinki. The journey was extremely difficult due to heavy rain and snow.</p>
<p>Each stage had a strict timetable. Competitors would be penalized for every minute of loss or any damage to the exterior of their cars.</p>
<p>Among the 25 competitors in the Mita class cars with a cubic capacity of over 1500 C.C., twelve reached the finish line without any loss of points. No less than nine of them were driving Ford cars, mostly V8 models.</p>

<h3>A Burned Love Letter in the Home of Pat O'Brien</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Pat O'Brien's family is one of the happiest families in Hollywood, but the success of this family and the happiness of the two of them are due to the recovery of a lost letter. Otherwise, their future would be unpredictable. Perhaps they would have failed, and even their names would not be heard.</p>
<p>The lost letter was an airmail letter. The plane crashed and the letter was lost. But that letter was the lifeline of both of them. Half a year later, the letter was rediscovered, and their new life began again. What a dangerous thing it was!</p>
<p>Almost six years ago, Pat O'Brien and Eloise Taylor were both acting in a theater troupe in Chicago. Their romance was known to everyone. They were madly in love and planned to get married on the first day of the break after a season and go on their honeymoon. That night was the last night of the season, and for Eloise, it was the last time in her life to be on stage. She loved Pat so much that she was willing to sacrifice her own future to be Pat's good wife. She believed that Pat's future would be successful. He would soon be on stage on Broadway in New York. They both had unlimited hope.</p>
<p>But that very night, they quarreled. It was a very fierce quarrel because it was the first quarrel. The reason was a very minor thing, and even they themselves could not say what it was. But Pat's strong Irish temper was uncontrollable. He said things that he would not normally say. Eloise also had her own temper. They soon began to scold each other, saying things that did not make sense. But they agreed on one point... that their romance was a foolish move and that their marriage would be a lifelong mistake, so it was better to break up now! They both said that they would never see each other again!</p>
<p>Their quarrel took place backstage in the theater. After the quarrel, Pat immediately returned to his residence, packed his bags, and took the train to New York that night. But after the train left, Pat's temper slowly subsided. When he arrived in New York, he was very remorseful and scolded himself for doing such a stupid thing. He wanted to take the original train back to Chicago immediately, but he remembered that Eloise had said that she would never see him again, and perhaps that was her true feeling. So he thought it was better to write a letter to apologize first.</p>
<p>He arrived at the inn and immediately wrote a letter to Eloise. He used ten large sheets of paper to finish writing the elegy in his heart, all kinds of apologies, asking her to forgive him. Finally, he also said that if she did not reply immediately, he would think that she really did not want to see him, but he would not blame her, because she knew that he was not worthy of loving her.</p>
<p>He sent the letter by airmail. Since then, he has been waiting for a reply all the time. When the phone rang or someone knocked on the door, he would jump up, but he waited day after day, but there was no news. In his disappointment, the play he was performing also failed. He was almost impoverished and bored to the point of suicide. In this way, he endured day after day for six months. Suddenly one day, he received a letter from the government, and when he opened it, it was the long letter he had sent to Eloise six months ago. The letter had been burned beyond recognition. Fortunately, the address of the sender was still vaguely visible, so he tried to return it. It turned out that the plane had crashed, and his letter had never been delivered.</p>
<p>Pat received the returned letter and immediately rushed to the telegraph office to send a long telegram to Eloise's home, almost as long as that letter. He then returned to the inn and waited anxiously again. But this time he did not have to wait long. He received a telegram from Eloise saying that she had already forgiven him and that she had been regretting it every day since they parted. Pat received the telegram and did not reply to her again. He didn't have time to pack his bags, just grabbed a toothbrush, and immediately rushed to where Eloise lived. As soon as he arrived there, they got married that day.</p>
<p>That was more than five years ago. Since they got married, Pat O'Brien has been sailing smoothly, without any setbacks. He returned to the stage in New York and won great acclaim in the theater world. Hollywood heard his name and hired him to make movies. He still attributes his success to the help of his wife. As for the burned letter, they framed it and hung it in the study. Every time they were about to quarrel, they just looked at the frame and laughed it off.</p>
<h3>A Hollywood Insider Says</h3>
<p>— Qi Guan</p>
<p>A Hollywood insider said: "If you take the copies of the 57 films directed by Cecil B. DeMille and connect them together, they can circle the earth east and west, and then circle the earth north and south."</p>
<p>"If a person gets permission from the owners of the New York and Los Angeles theaters to take a day's box office revenue as their own, they can immediately become a millionaire."</p>
<p>"If the MGM studio needs to completely replace new equipment due to an incident, all the goods in the largest department store in New York City would not be one-third of what is moved out of the MGM studio. In other words, the equipment moved out of the MGM studio can open three or more of the largest department stores in New York."</p>
<p>"If you take the world's largest screen in the New York Paramount Company and move it to the ground, three hundred people can stand on it very sparsely."</p>
<p>"There are a total of 14,900 cinemas in Europe, but that is still 7,100 fewer than the number of cinemas in the United States alone."</p>
<p>"If a person can gather all the income from American cinemas in one month, no rich man in the world can compete with him. This number is really difficult to calculate."</p>
<p>"The world's largest open-air cinema is at the foot of Beverly Hills in Hollywood. If it is used as an airport in winter when it is not in use, it can accommodate as many as 50 German Junkers aircraft."</p>
<p>"If Paramount Pictures Corporation were to clear out its interior and auction off all the wheels, it could open a large automobile company. In addition to those used by stars and directors and for private use, there are 3,200 vehicles."</p>
<p>"If all the planes in the various film companies in Hollywood were to take off and fly in the sky over Honolulu, many people would definitely think that military action had started in Honolulu the next day."</p>
<h3>"The Eternal Family," currently in production</h3>
<p>Zhong Shigen's great work "The Eternal Family," after "Life," is being co-directed by Luo Mingyou and Fei Mu, and production has already begun. The grandeur of this drama can be described as unprecedented in the Chinese silver screen for several years. The richness and moving nature of the content is undoubtedly due to the fact that you cannot find anything empty and boring in Zhong's script. As for the cast, this time it can almost be called a collaboration of all the stars. Lin Chuchu, Chen Yanyan, Li Zhuozhuo; Zhang Yi, Zheng Junli, Li Keng, Shang Guanwu, Mei Lin... are all showing their talents here. This drama writes the story of three couples in three eras, Shang Guanwu and Lin Chuchu, Zhang Yi and Li Zhuozhuo, Zheng Junli and Mei Lin. Chen Yanyan plays the daughter of Chuchu Guanwu, and Li Keng is the young Zheng Junli. Now, the scenes being filmed are all the important scenes of Lin Chuchu and Chen Yanyan, because the scenes being filmed are very emotional, so they can all be truly emotional, especially the tragic parts are very fruitful.</p>

<h3>Wang Renmei Cries Bitterly</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that Wang Renmei is a jumping, forever carefree wildcat. But when Xu Xingzhi told her that in this scene she had to hug Mu Zhi and cry bitterly, the more sad the better, and that this was a climax in "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" and was very important to the whole drama, she immediately stopped smiling and became dazed.</p>
<p>Yes, crying bitterly and shedding tears is really too difficult for a carefree wildcat. So she sat blankly on the sofa until Xingzhi told her to start shooting, and she still stood up blankly, walked to Yuan Muzhi, hugged him, and remained silent.</p>
<p>After Xingzhi's "Camera rolling!" was shouted, Renmei began to sob and cry, and she cried so sadly that everyone on the set thought she was pretending to cry, but everyone was surprised at how she could cry so realistically.</p>
<p>But after Muzhi raised his face, he saw that she was already in tears, and she was crying more and more sadly. This made Xingzhi anxious, and he quickly shouted "Cut!" Perhaps she couldn't control the bursting emotions! Renmei sat on the sofa and still cried non-stop. Xingzhi persuaded her for a while before she stopped crying.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Situ Huimin ran out of the sound room and said to Xingzhi that Renmei's crying in this scene was so moving when it was broadcast on the radio.</p>
<h3>Special Issue of "The Red Goat Biography"</h3>

<h3>The Red Sheep Gallants, Part 9</h3>
<p>— Zhao Chu</p>
<p>Zeng and Shi arrived at the Gui Ping county yamen and waited in the reception hall. Zeng said, "If he accepts our silver, the matter will be settled." Just as he was speaking, an elderly man resembling a yamen secretary, wearing glasses, came out from within. Smiling at them, he cupped his hands and said, "Congratulations, congratulations! The matter has finally been settled." The elderly man urgently continued, "The matter almost stalled. He was unwilling to accept it. I said that Mr. Wei's crime was only a fabrication by Vice General Li, lacking any real evidence, and it would be best to do a favor." Only then was the matter settled. Zeng Yuheng hurriedly cupped his hands in greeting and said, "Fortunately, we relied on Master Wang's great efforts. We are truly grateful." As he spoke, he took out a small package from his pocket and handed it to the old man, saying, "This small token expresses our gratitude." The old man repeatedly declined, but in the end, he accepted it, saying, "Mr. Wei will surely be safely home tomorrow. The two of you can rest assured." Thereupon, Zeng and Shi expressed their gratitude and took their leave.</p>
<p>The next day, Li Dianyuan was in the process of reviewing official documents when the clerk hurriedly rushed in and said to Li, "Wei Changhui was released by the magistrate early this morning. I heard that someone went to the county to pull strings yesterday and obtained a lot of illicit money." Upon hearing this, Vice General Li stood up in anger and scolded, "He clearly wants to deceive me! He is being too insolent! We are both officials of the imperial court; how can I let him get away with this?!" As he spoke, he smashed the teacup in his hand on the ground. Vice General Li paced back and forth in the room and then turned back to the clerk and said, "Quickly prepare thirty mounted escorts! I will personally bring Wei Changhui back!" The clerk agreed and hurriedly turned to leave.</p>
<p>On the road out of the city, Wei Changhui looked very dejected. He was being carried in a soft chair by two men. An old family servant supported him from the side, saying, "Young Master, this is truly an unprovoked disaster. You have suffered this terrible punishment for no reason." Changhui sighed and said, "In this world, is there any right or wrong, black or white?" As he spoke, he continued forward. Unexpectedly, Vice General Li led more than twenty riders, galloping towards them. Wei Changhui's sedan chair arrived in front of the Wei family ancestral hall and stopped for a temporary rest. Vice General Li's men arrived soon after. Upon seeing Wei, Li immediately dismounted, walked up to Wei, and grabbed him. The old family servant stepped forward to protect him but was pushed to the ground. Vice General Li asked very fiercely, "How did you escape?" Wei replied, "The county released me because I am innocent. How can you say I escaped?" Li, in extreme anger, cursed, "How dare you not go through my interrogation?!" As he spoke, he snatched the whip from an attendant's hand and lashed it fiercely at Wei's face. Then he kicked Wei, knocking him to the ground. Li then shouted to the soldiers, "Quickly tie him up! I will personally interrogate him!" Thereupon, several soldiers stepped forward and tied him to a tree. Vice General Li, holding the whip in one hand, tore off Wei's clothes, saying, "Why don't you get the county to protect you?" As he spoke, he lashed down with the whip again. The old family servant, hearing the sound of the beating, stealthily hid behind people and ran away. The villagers all around gathered to watch. Some of the elders said, "Why is it Young Master Wei being beaten?" Wei Changhui endured the beating, almost fainting, moaning incessantly. Vice General Li, in extreme ferocity, beat him while saying, "Let's see what you have to say for yourself!"</p>
<p>Shi Dakai, Zeng Yuheng, and Yang Xiuqing were sitting in the Wei family's main hall, talking with Wei's father. Zeng Yuheng said, "Brother Wei should be back soon." Just as he said this, the old family servant, his head bleeding, walked in in a disheveled state, and said in a flustered manner, "We were halfway back when that Vice General Li chased after us again, tied the young master to a tree and is whipping him. He is almost beating him to death now." As he spoke, he cried out in sorrow and indignation. (To be continued)</p>
