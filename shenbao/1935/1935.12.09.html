<p>— 都</p>
<p>保障輿論之聲浪。一再喧騰於吾人之耳鼓。皇皇提案。滔滔閎辯未嘗不令人心折嚮往。翹首跂踵以佇其實現。迄於最近。一中全會中。復有周佛海等五十六人提議。函國府通令全國切實保障輿論。並由常會切實改善新聞檢查辦法。業經第三次大會决議通過。觀於今回一再援引「切實」字樣。似非復如往常徒託空言可比。自經此次國府通令之後。地方機關若仍有摧隳正當輿論之事實發生。卽為弁髦法令。藐視中央。中央為顧全國家威信計。必宜有適當之制裁。為「切實」下注脚。吾輩從事新聞事業者。應如何底厲身心。勉盡職責。以代表民間喉舌上副國家期望耶。至如檢查新聞。原屬臨時辦法。在漂搖局面未吿完全穩定之前。政府不欲遽予撤消。吾人亦寧無諒解之同情。而檢查辦法之亟待改善。則為事實所不容恝然者。今且於中常會未經擬訂之先。一抒吾人之意見。</p>
<p>檢查新聞之動機。原在謀行政之利便。一方用以防止機密消息之洩露。一方亦在闡明當局辦事之立塲。故其目標完全以國家利益為對象。實為非常時期一種不得已之措置。過去檢查新聞。似猶未能盡飫人望。此後改善之點。吾人以為。第一。應確定檢查之範圍與標準。軍事策略。外交方針。事關黨國大計。未容任意披露。誠應痛快入檢查範圍之內。其他類似事件在政府認為有秘密之必要。而未便一一列舉者。不妨規定標準。籍資適從。至若地方設施私人得失。枝節問題無關宏指者。皆不應利用職權率予限制。以符保陳輿論之旨。第二。應明課檢查人員以資任。而賦以便宜應付之權檢查新聞人員。對上級故應矢其服從之義務。對報紙亦當盡其維護之責任。若遇疑難事件發生。範圍不淸。標準不明之時。惟賴檢查員運用明晰之頭腦。依據平衡之觀察。以常識為判斷。符實際之需要。當局對於檢查人員。誠能事前予以應付之便宜。事後勿為毛疵之糾　。則檢查員與報紙間。必可保持協調之精神。蠲免無謂之糾葛。非然者。檢查員一遇疑似問題。斟情放行則權力未逮。向上請示則時間不許。勢必出於任意抹煞之一途。以逃避對上之責任。如此漫無準則。紊亂之局卽成。往往同一性質之新聞。或昨是而今非。或此放而彼扣。有纔露面目卽遭斬截者。有未叙原委突如其來者。讀者如墮雲霧。報紙備受譴責。凡此皆為事實所難以諱飾者。甚願常會諸委於新訂辦法中予以切實之改善也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）海軍會議將於星期一開幕、殘破之華盛頓條約、以今日情形觀之、似已萬難挽救、而世界列强靡費萬萬金錢之海軍競爭、處於國家主義高潮推動之中、亦屬事在必行、根據華府條約規定、苟有簽孛國宣布廢止、則於一年之後必須召集會議、現在英國發出請柬之時、意阿戰爭所引起之局勢、適生極大之壓力、而遠東復因華北之自治問題、發生嚴重之危機、英美二國當局已表示深切注意、並稱九國公約與海軍條約有聯帶關係、倘有違反、決不容許、然海會開幕之後、卽使日本之平等要求、能打破英美之反對而得滿意、法意對立之勢亦頗費斟酌、英德二國之海軍恊定、已將凡爾賽和約之海軍條欵宣吿死刑、法國當然須增加其海軍實力、故此間經騐豐富之觀察者、咸以為此次會議對於减縮軍備、已完全絕望、卽防止擴張亦希望甚微云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>洛迦諾室佈置一新</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍會議定於星期一日午前、在外務部一洛迦諾」室、由首相鮑爾溫主席正式開幕、此室係洛迦諾公約簽字之室、在外務部二樓、室形長方、寬敞多窗、四壁張紅色織錦、沿壁則置綠呢長桌、以供會議之需、啟窗出視、卽係外部院庭、開會時將僅有少數新聞記者許入會塲、但在會議時間不得出外、其他記者則均在其旁外部餐廳坐候、會塲演說由傳聲機傳送隔室、演詞全文另由速記員加以紀錄、一切文件則由大會秘書處分送各報、預定程序係先由首相鮑爾溫致開幕詞、嗣由各國首席代表按照國名首一字母次序依次演說、至會議所用文字則英國主張僅以英文作為正式文字、但因法國代表提出異議之故、秘書處業已决定一切演說文伴、以英法兩文並用、由外務部譯員担任譯事、以後歷次會議、將在外務部對面「克拉倫斯」大厦舉行、英政府業已租就兩層、專供會議之用、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英美與日對立形勢</p>
<p>（倫敦）此次會議之特點、為事前與會之各國中並未商妥共同之立塲、據非官塲方面略述種種觀察點、足以證明此事如紊絲之難治、而成功多繫於日本之態度、蓋日本今堅决要求其海軍應與英美均等、實足會議最重大之障礙也、日本如能達到此點、則願將主力艦飛機母艦萬噸巡洋艦加以廢除、或大加限制、英國因有保衛其遍播世界之帝國之必要、故反對與日均等、惟可歡迎今後置較小之戰艦及巡洋艦噸位以七千噸為限、但英國之承認巡洋艦五十艘目前之限額、僅為暫時事、他日必將恢復舊日七十艘至少之限額、英國大約尙將主張將戰艦之年齡自二十年展至二十六年、豫料此可為獲一般妥協之數點之一、美國亦堅决反對日本均等之要求、而欲維持前在華盛頓商定之軍艦型式、卽戰艦以三萬五千噸為限、巡洋艦以萬噸為限是、美國或能允將戰艦之十六吋大砲减小口徑、聞美國並欲置與英國同數之巡洋艦、但可贊同潛艇之廢除美日代表團今均未由其政府授權辦理政治問題、但美國今對於華北事件戚印甚深、故日本對華政策之羼入會議中、亦人人意中事也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>法意親善易獲妥協</p>
<p>（倫敦）英法兩國近數日來有友好之外交接觸、故法國對於數點、與英國密切和諧、惟法國非至更明悉德國之意志時、殊不欲作何担任也、再法國對於廢除潛艇不願贊成、意國前曾要求置與法國同數之潛艇、使法國頗為憤懣、惟兩國邇來之親善、或可使此節易獲妥協也、意國現共有潛艇八十三艘多屬甚新式者、故决不願廢除此項利器、再意國現已開造三萬五千噸之戰艦兩艘、此事使英國對於地中海方面甚為担憂、（八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）昨晚意相墨索里尼在衆院發强硬之演說、已打銷意阿戰爭早日解决之一切希望、日內瓦視前途極端惡劣、因墨氏復拒絕和議故也、英外相霍爾今將在巴黎與法總理賴伐爾會商多次、以定後此步驟、故一般人之目光、今咸集中於巴黎、兩要員之第一次會商、已於昨晚在法外交部舉行、歷兩小時十五分之久、英外交部阿務專家彼得森英駐法大使克勒克英外次樊西太特均列席、會議畢、賴伐爾發表公報稱、英法政府關於雙方進行目的與密切合作、完全同意、明晨十時三十分將續開會議云、（八日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）據本社外交訪員探悉、英法兩國談話如不能在今晚成立完全妥協、則英國外相霍爾或將在此多留一日、明日當不至啟程前往瑞士聖摩里茨城、至今後談話、則大約將由英國外務次官注西泰爵士與法國外部秘書長雷瑞、會同兩國專家賡續進行、以便完成所擬提出之建議草案、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯方面深覺意相墨索里尼在衆院之演說、已使本年年底以前之和平希望、完全斷絕、此間今日相信、國聯雖有通過煤油及煤鐵制裁之恫嚇、意國仍將一意孤行、而英國外相上星期四之演說、亦已表示英國將艦續擁護國、故十八國委員會通過早日實施對意禁運煤油及銅煤鐵之議、目前已無法可以挽回矣、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>英法談話範圍廣泛</p>
<p>（巴黎）據本社訪員所知、霍爾賴伐爾昨日會談時、除意阿問題外、尙將（一）英法兩國與德國間之關係（二）天空洛迦諾公約、及（三）地中海方面英法兩國合作問題加以討論、法國外部軍縮問題馬西格利時亦在座、關於一二兩項、霍爾興賴伐爾曾將本年二月三日英法倫敦宣言書所建議各端、重新提出研究、（此項建議、卽（甲）訂立限制軍備公約、以代替凡爾賽和約軍事條欵、（乙）德國重返國聯會（丙）簽訂天空公約、（丁）簽訂多瑙河公約、（戊）簽訂東歐互助公約）並對訂立天空公約及限制空軍軍備兩項、再度商得同意、惟因德國主張先將意阿爭端解决、然後討論上述問題之故、英法兩國是否將向柏林重新提出交涉尙不可知、關於第三項地中海合作問題、霍爾與賴伐爾議决、由兩國專家立卽舉行談話加以討論、至於意阿爭端、據本社訪員所知、英國方面現已準備有所讓步、卽如該國前此主張阿國讓予意國之南部土地、西至東經四十度為止、現則已願按照法國提議展至東徑三十八度、惟目前尙有多數困難之點、仍待解决、故英法談話何時始有切實效果、尙難逆料耳、（八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>對意將以高施壓力</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國外相霍爾、今日與法國總理賴伐爾終日會議同時據悉英法二國已向意國施行重大之壓力、法國外部曾以新訓令電致法國駐意大使香勃倫、令向意相墨索里尼傳達、並悉英國駐意大使與墨氏會晤之後、復曾與意國外次蘇維區晤談、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據巴黎消息靈通各界聲稱、霍爾與賴伐爾决議兩國應卽共同致牒意政府、如墨索里尼之覆文不能使兩國滿意、則兩國應在十二月十二日十八人委員會會議中主張自明年一月一日起實施對意油禁、此種手續使意國有廻旋之餘地、俾得在新年以前變更其主見、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>實施油禁爭不容緩</p>
<p>（倫敦）聞日內瓦今有數方面殊不以展緩實施油禁之决議為然、此種見解雖未為衆所贊同、但意飛機屢次轟擊阿國不設防之城鎭、已使各方戚覺實施油禁為急不容緩之圖、英國國聯事務大員艾登已定本星期內赴日內瓦、參與十八人委員會重要會議、墨索里尼之演說、雖可謂為未對閉談判之門戶、但其意中實不欲覓求釋爭之方案、故倫敦與巴黎皆以倔强目之、英法政府則仍决計照兩國專家在巴黎所定之和平方案而進行一切、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>割地非阿國能接受</p>
<p>（倫敦）據聞英法兩國專家建議辦法、對於意相墨索里尼所要求伊利里特里與索謀里蘭兩地連接一層、並未予以滿足、按此項要求欲予實現、必當以阿國哈拉爾省割予意國、此在阿國皇帝則業已通知英法兩國、謂决非所能接受云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國外交部方面對於意相墨索里尼本日在衆院所發表之演說、雖不作何項聲明、但均以為墨氏演說、業使各方感覺失望、蓋以墨氏不第並未說明意國對於阿此西尼亞所擬提出之最低限度要求、顧反重言申明、意國在菲洲之權利與利益若不予以承認、則當繼續軍事行動、直至獲得最後勝利而後止、因此英國外相霍爾與法國賴伐爾總理本日之會晤、縱使兩人業已獲得同意、而和議之前途、則已十分渺茫、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 唐慶主編</p>
<p>勞資調協　朱通九</p>
<p>一，勞資調協的意義工業革命以後，勞資雙方，形成對峙之局，明爭暗鬥，各盡其能國。今日工人罷工，明日資方停廠，彼此均各利用其戰鬥工具，盡其克敵之能事。實則勞力與資本，均為生產上不可缺少之要素，理應彼此合作，生產始得增加，社會得蒙其利。今乃彼此不諒，妄事爭鬥，不特於勞資雙方，各受巨大損失，抑且生產低落，社會不寗，於社會全體福利，發生嚴重影響。各國政府，有鑒於此，特頒布法律，規定勞資雙方，不得任意罷工或停廠，如有意見不合或利害衝突，須依規定法律手續，從事調解；設調解失敗，繼以仲裁，使事熊不至擴大，從速解决，而後已。此種調解或仲裁，謂之勞資調恊。</p>
<p>二，勞資糾紛發生的原因勞資糾紛的發生，其原因頗多，且因社會事態變遷而不同。然其主要原因，不外增加工資，改良待遇等項。民國十五年罷工次數為五三五次，工人因經濟壓迫而罷工者計二五〇次，占全數百分之四六·七；因待遇問題而罷工者計一七二次，占全數百分之三一·一左右。民國十八年上海之罷工統計，罷工次數為一百十一次，而因雇用與解雇問題而罷工者，有三十六次，占全數百分之三二·四三，居第一位。因工資問題而罷工者，計二十六次，占全數百分二三·四三，屬於第二位。民國二十二年我國全國勞資糾紛總數為五二七次。因解僱或僱用關係而發生者為一六七次，占全數百分之三一·六九；因工資問題而發生者一二七次，占全數百分之二四·一〇。根據上述統計，可知勞資糾紛之主要原因有二，一為解僱或僱用關係，二為工資問題。至其他原因，依照中國經濟年鑒二十四年續編所載，大概如下：A與團體交涉有關之勞資糾紛，（一）工會勞動者的協調方面，甲，工作，乙，勞動協約。（二）關於僱用狀况者，有甲，工資，乙工時，丙待遇，丁廠規，戊工作制度，己僱用，或解儷，庚歇業或暫時停業。B與團體交涉無關之勞資糾紛，（一）同情的，（二）政治的，（三）其他。</p>
<p>三，勞資調恊的原則勞資調協的目的，在乎維持工業的和平，而欲使勞資調恊實施的有效，必先確定勞資調協之原則，始能進行順利，勞資雙方，翁然遵從。計勞資協調的原則，約有下列各項：</p>
<p>一，嚴格規定僱用與解僱方法查考我國近年勞資糾紛之第一主要原因，為僱用或解僱問題，則為避免糾紛發生起見須嚴定僱用與解僱之條件。在平日工廠僱用工人之時，工人如無過失，不能任意解僱。同時事實非解僱不可，則事前通知工人，俾工人得以早日從容招尋工作，不至卽受失業之痛苦。且工廠解僱工人，須付解僱金，卽所謂DismissalWays是。如此嚴格規定以後，工廠對於解僱工人，須謹愼從事，否則必受支付解僱金之損失。故工廠為免去損失計及减低熟練工人流動計，自必不願隨意解僱工人，糾紛卽可减去。且第三者或政府出而調停或仲裁，亦有所依據，糾紛亦易於短期間內吿一段落。、</p>
<p>二工資與生活程度勞資糾紛之第二主要原因為工資問題，則工瓷之高下或增加興否應以生活程度為標準。設物價水準上升，貨幣工資之購買力下降，則工廠對於貨幣工資，理應增加。故如因工資問題而發生糾紛，則工資之增加應以物價增高之程度為標準。使工人所得工資，得以購買生活上必需之食料，以充滿工人物質上之最低要求。且工人食料之充分與否，與工人之工作效率，有密切之關係。設工人所食資養料過少，工作效率减低，於工廠方面亦有無形損失。所以工資數目的决定，須以生活程度為標準。</p>
<p>三，公營事業公營事業如自來水，電氣，電話，電車，公共汽車，鐵路，郵局等項，不以營利為目的，而以服務社會為職責。且經營上述各項之公營事業，近代均由政府或地方公共機關辦理，故公營事業工人之對象，卽為公衆或政府。所以公營事業之工人，不論待遇稍差或工資减少，不能因要求不遂，而立刻宣布罷工。因此種公營事業的停頓，使社會全體，遽蒙不利。所以各國對於公營事業的工人，頒布嚴格的條例，如有相當要求，必須遵照一定手續，依法請求，靜待當局核准處理，而對於罷工，則絕對禁止。我國勞資爭議處理法第四條規定如下：「左列各事業發生勞資爭議，其事件經調解而無結果者，應付仲裁委員會仲裁。（一）供公共需要之自來水電燈或煤氣事業。（二）供公衆需要之郵務，電報，電話，鐵路，電車，航路及公用汽車事業」。所謂仲裁，卽表示勞資雙方，經仲裁委員會之裁判，不得申明異議，寓有强制執行，與禁止之意。所以同法第七條規定「爭議當事人對於仲裁委員會之裁判，不得聲明不服。」</p>

<p>— 中央研究院總幹事丁文江</p>
<p>（十一月二十六日對全國中等學校學生演講）</p>
<p>凡此種種，舉不勝舉。上面所說的不過就中央研究院已經着手的問題，隨便舉幾個實例而已。</p>
<p>以上所說的兩種任務以外，中央研究院還有許多工作，一部份是沒有直接經濟價值的，如所謂純粹的物理和化學。一部份是完全沒有經濟價值的，如歷史語言人種考古。</p>
<p>先講所謂純粹科學問題。國家是否應該化許多錢來提倡沒有直接經濟價值的研究。世界各國，在過去與現在都有人提出這個問題。可是事實上凡是應用科學發達的國家，沒有不同時極力提倡純粹科學的。美國脊許多純粹科學研究，都是實業界化錢，因為純粹與應用，根本無從分別的。許多科學的應用，都是發端於所謂純粹的研究。這種例舉不勝舉。工程學的全部是從物理化學來的。無綫電和X光綫就是很明顯的實例，就地質學而言，最無用最純粹莫過於古生物。近來美國因為搜求油礦，不能不利用古生物來計算油層的上下深淺。古生物學一變而為石油地性學者的必需科目。翁文灝先生說得好，科學是整個的，本無所謂純粹與應用。與其說應用的科學，不如說科學的應用。</p>
<p>其次要說到到史語言考古人種和所謂社會科學，這裏面一部份是最新的科學，如考古人種；一部份是最古的學問，而最近纔科學化的如歷史語言，旣然科學化了，他的性質與所謂自然科學，就沒有根本的分。。凡上面所討論純粹科學的話，都可以引用到這裏來。而且在今日的中國，研究這種學問的人，還有一個很大的使命。中國的不容易統一，最大的原因，是我們沒有公共的信仰。這種仰信的基礎，是要建在我們對於自己的認識上面的。歷史和考古，是研究我們民族的過去，考古人種及其他的社會科學是研究我們民族的現在。把我們民族的過去與現在都研究明白了，我們方能够了解自己。最明顯的例，莫如歷史與考古。許多守舊的人，還相信上古有「黃金時代」，所以主張維持舊禮教，讀經，復古。中央研究院近幾年來，在河南安陽縣發掘商朝時代的舊都與陵墓。得到許多材料，使我們了解那時候人的生活狀况。他們迷信的奇異殘酷，生活的簡單幼稚，很可以帮助我們打破「黃金時代」的觀念。譬如一個皇帝死了，殉葬的車馬器皿不算外，還要砍幾百個人頭，埋在四面，宮室大都是板築，因為磚瓦還沒有發明，皇帝的祭祀，田獵，戰爭，一切都聽命於卜卦。把龜板上挖一個窟窿，用火燒他，然後再看上面的裂痕，夾斷定所卜的吉凶。如果主張復古的人是對的，復古應復到甚麼程度？假如我們恢復到商朝的文化程度，我們又如何能够生活？考古歷史的貢獻如此，其他也復如此。了解遠東各種民族根本是無大區別，有測量可證；了解各種方言完全是一種語言的變相；了解中華民國是一個整個的經濟單位，分裂以後，無法生存；然後統一的基礎，纔建設在國民的自覺之上。</p>
<p>以上所講的是中央研究院實行科學的辦法。至於指導聯絡獎勵學術研究的任務，是由中央研究院的評議會主持。評議會一共有四十一個會員。中央研究院的院長與十個所長，是當然會員，其餘的三十個人是由各國立大學校長選舉，再由國民政府聘任的，第一任的評議會於本年幾月成立。凡國內重要的研究機關，如北平研究院，地質調查所，農事實騐所，科學社的生物研究所，中華教育文化基金會的靜生至物調查所，黃海工業化學研究社·北京。淸華·武漢·中央·中山·浙江·南開·協和·燕京各大學都有代表當選。所以中央研究院的評議會，是一個代表全國學術研究的機關。開會的時候，照中央研究院已經設立的科目分組。再由各組委員會，調查全國研究機關的成績和全國學者所發表的著作，以為將來聯絡合作的基礎。</p>
<p>其實在評議會成立以前，國內的研究機關，已經有相當的聯絡與合作。譬如地質，有實業部的地質調查所，中央研究院的地質研究所，兩廣地質調查所，河南地質調查所，湖南地質調查所。近幾年來這五個機關的工作，都有合理的分配，後來沒有絲毫的重複，並且各機關互相援助，不分界限。譬如去年兩廣地質調查所調查廣西地質，職員不够分配，就由中央研究院派了兩個人加入。中央研究院派了一個研究員到雲南調查礦產，地質調查所又派一個調查員做他的助手。湖南地質調查所經費不足，中央地質調查所每年就津貼他八千元，並且派人在湖南帮他們工作。又譬如生物，中央研究院的動植物研究所，中國科學社的生物研究所，在北平的靜生生物調查所，北平研究院的動物植物研究所，都商量得有分工合作的辦法。在北平的機關，擔任中國北部的生物調查。科學社擔任揚子江流域生物的分類，中央研究院則注重沿海的海洋生物。沿太平洋的國家有一個太平洋科學恊會。會理面有一個研究海洋學的委員會。各會員國家都設有分會。本年四月，中國的分會，由中央研究院發起成立。分為一·漁業技術。二·漁業。三·珊瑚礁。四·物理海洋學。五·海產生物學五組。各組會所代表的機關，除中央研究院外有北平研究院，中國科學社，靜生生物調查所，實業部，海軍部海道測量局，山東，厦門，中山各大學，靑島市觀象台，中國動物學會，江浙兩省水產試騐塲等團體。當時决議在厦門，定海，烟台，靑島四處設立海洋生物研究室·由厦門大學，中央研究院，北平研究院，山東大學和靑島觀象台分別主持。同時海軍部海道測量局，用資源委員會，財政部鹽務署，中央研究院三處的補助費，提前測量揚子江口到海州的海道詳圖。第三艦隊又把定海軍艦，借給中央研究院，在山東半島渤海灣作研究海洋生物的工作。中央研究院的職員常常在各大學担任教課，可是他們雖然兼差却不兼薪。因為中央研究院所有的職員，都受嚴格的限制，不准以任何名目，在院外受任何的薪水和公費，</p>
<p>此外中央研究院與各方面合作的事業，還有很多，我沒有時間詳細說明。上面所舉的幾個例，巳經可以證明國內的研究機關，並沒有多少衝突或是重複。而他們的五助合作的精神，很可以為其他團體作模範的。</p>
<p>最後還有一個問題，值得我們的討論。我上一次播音的時候，會經講過，現在中國公私方面，每年用於科學研究的欵項，大約在四百萬元左右。要知道這個數目的意義，我們可以拿其他各國來作比較。據美國中央科學研究評議會NationalReseachCouncil的估計。美國每天所用於工業研究的費用，約為七十五萬金元。所以我們全國用於科學研究全年的經費，還抵不上美國用於工業研究的兩天的欵項。上面所說的數目，還不包括美國各博物院，各大學及政府機關，如中央地質調查所之類，單是地質調查所，每年的經費就有三百萬金元之多。各項合計起來，美國全國每年用於科學研究的欵項，至少有三萬萬金元。照現在的滙兌，約有國幣九萬萬元。所以我們用於科學研究的經費，還抵不上美國二百分之一。據赫胥黎FnleanHuxley估計，英國人用於科學研究的費用，約為美國四分之一·就是比我們要多五十倍。我們的人口，比美國要多四倍，比英國多八倍我們一切工業學術都比英美人落後一幾十年。由此可以知道我們現在所用於科究的經費，與我們的需要相比，眞正不過牛的一毛（完）</p>

<p>— 中央研究院總幹事丁文江</p>
<p>（十一月二十六日對全國中等學校演講）</p>
<p>凡此種種，舉不勝舉。上面所說的不過就中央研究院已經着手的問題，隨便舉幾個實例而已。</p>
<p>以上所說的兩種任務以外，中央研究院還有許多工作，一部份是沒有直接經濟價值的，如所謂純粹的物理和化學。一部份是完全沒有經濟價值的，如歷史語言人種考古。</p>
<p>先講所謂純粹科學問題。國家是否應該化許多錢來提倡沒有直接經濟價值的研究。世界各國，在過去與現在都有人提出這個問題。可是事實上凡是應用科學發達的國家，沒有不同時極力提倡純粹科學的。美國有許多純粹科學研究，都是實業界化錢，因為純粹與應用，根本無從分別的。許多科學的應用，都是發端於所謂純粹的研究。這種例舉不勝舉。工程學的全部是從物理化學來的。無綫電和X光綫就是很明顯的實例，就地質學而言，最無用最純粹莫過於古生物。近來美國因為搜求油礦，不能不利用古生物來計算油層的上下深淺。古生物學一變而為石油地性學者的必需科目。翁文灝先生說得好，科學是整個的，本無所謂純粹與應用。與其說應用的科學，不如設科學的應用。</p>
<p>其次要說到歷史語言考古人種和所謂社會科學，這裏面一部份是最新的科學，如考古人種；一部份是最古的學問，而最近纔科學化的如歷史語言，旣然科學化了，他的性質與所謂自然科學，就沒有根本的分別。凡上面所討論純粹科學的話，都可以引用到這裏來·而且在今日的中國，研究這種學問的人，還有一個很大的使命。中國的不容易統一，最大的原因，是我們沒有公共的信仰。這種仰信的基礎，是要建在我們對於自己的認識上面的。歷史和考古，是研究我們民族的過去，考古人種及其他的社會科學是研究我們民族的現在。把我們民族的過去與現在都研究明白了，我們方能够了解自己。最明顯的例，莫如歷史與考古。許多守舊的人，還相信上古有「黃金時代」，所以主張維持舊禮教，讀經，復古。中央研究院近幾年來，在河南安陽縣發掘商朝時代的舊都與陵墓。得到許多材料，使我們了解那時候人的生活狀况。他們迷信的奇異殘酷，生活的簡單幼稚，很可以帮助我們打破「黃金時代」的觀念。譬如一個皇帝死了，殉葬的車馬器皿不算外，還要砍幾百個人頭，埋在四面，宮室大都是板築，因為磚瓦還沒有發明，皇帝的祭祀，田獵，戰爭，一切都聽命於卜卦。把龜板上挖一個窟窿，用火燒他，然後再看上面的裂痕，來斷定所卜的吉凶。如果主張復古的人是對的，復古應復到甚麼程度？假如我們恢復到商朝的文化程度，我們又如何能够生活？考古歷史的貢獻如此，其他也復如此。了解遠東各種民族根本是無大區別，有測量可證；了解各種方言完全是一種語首的變相；了解中華民國是一個整個的經濟單位，分裂以後，無法生存；然後統一的基礎，纔建設在國民的自覺之上。</p>
<p>以上所講的是中央研究院實行科學的辦法。至於指導聯絡獎勵學術研究的任務，是由中央研究院的評議會主持。評議會一共有四十一僩會員。中央研究院的院長與十個所長，是當然會員，其餘的三十個人是由各國立大學校長選舉，再由國民政府聘任的，第一任的評議會於本年幾月成立。凡國內重要的研究機關，如北平研究院，地質調查所，農事實騐所，科學社的生物研究所，中華教育文化基金會的靜生生物調查所，黃海工業化學研究社·北京·淸華·武漢·中央·中山·浙江·南開·協和·燕京各大學都有代表當選。所以中央研究院的評議會，是一個代表全國學術研究的機關。開會的時候，照中央研究院已經設立的科目分組。再由各組委員會，調查全國研究機關的成績和全國學者所發表的著作，以為將來聯絡合作的基礎。</p>
<p>其實在評議會成立以前，國內的研究機關，已經有相當的聯絡與合作。譬如地質，有實業部的地質調查所，中央研究院的地質研究所，兩廣地質調查所，河南地質調查所，湖南地質調查所。近幾年來這五個機關的工作，都有合理的分配，後來沒有絲奄的重複，並且各機關互相援助，不分界限。譬如去年兩廣地質調查所調查廣西地質，職昌不够分配，就由中央研究院派了兩個人加入。中央研究院派了一個研究員到雲南調查礦產，地質調查所又派一個調查員做他的助手。湖南地質調查所經費不足，中央地質調查所每年就津貼他八千元，並且派人在湖南帮他們工作·又譬如生物，中央研究院的動植物研究所，中國科學社的生物研究所，在北平的靜生生物調查所，北平研究院的動物植物研究所，都商量得有分工合作的辦法。在北平的機關，擔任中國北部的生物調查。科學社擔任揚子江流域生物的分類，中央研究院則注重沿海的海洋生物。沿太平洋的國家有一個太平洋科學恊會。會理面有一個研究海洋學的委員會。各會員國家都設有分會。本年四月，中國的分會，由中央研究院發起成立。分為一。漁業技術。二·漁業。三·珊瑚礁。四。物理海洋學。五·海產生物學五組。各組會所代表的機關，除中央研究院外有北平研究院，中國科學社，靜生生物調查所，實業部，海軍部海道測量局，山東，厦門，中山各大學，靑島市觀象台，中國動物學會，江浙兩省水產試騐塲等團體。當時决議在厦門，定海，烟合，靑島四處設立海洋生物研究室·由厦門大學，中央研究院，北平研究院，山東大學和靑島觀象台分別主持。同時海軍部海道測量局，用資源委員會，財政部鹽務署，中央研究院三處的補助費，提前測量揚子江口到海州的海道詳圖。第三艦隊又把定海軍艦，借給中央研究院，在山東半烏渤海灣作研究海洋生物的工作。中央研究院的職員常常在各大學担任教課，可是他們雖然兼差却不兼薪。因為中央研究院所有的職員，都受嚴格的限制，不准以任何名目，在院外受任何的薪水和公費，</p>
<p>此外中央研究院與各方面合作的事業，還有很多，我沒有時間詳細說明。上面所舉的幾個例，巳經可以證明國內的研究機關，並沒有多少衝突或是重複。而他們的五助合作的精神，很可以為其他團體作模範的。</p>
<p>最後還有一個問題，值得我們的討論。我上一次播音的時候，會經講過，現在中國公私方面，每年用於科學研究的欵項，大約在四百萬元左右。要知道這個數目的意義，我們可以拿其他各國來作比較。據美國中央科學研究評議會NationalResachCouncil的估計。美國每天所用於工業研究的費用，約為七十五萬金元。所以我們全國用於科學研究全年的經費，還抵不上美國用於工業研究的兩天的欵項。上面所說的數目，還不包括美國各博物院，各大學及政府機關，如中央地質調查所之類，單是地質調查所，每年的經費就有三百萬金元之多。各項合計起來，美國全國每年用於科學研究的欵項，至少有三萬萬金元。照現在的滙兌，約有國幣九萬萬元。所以我們用於科學研究的經費，還抵不上美國二百分之一。據赫胥黎FuleanHuxley估計，英國人用於科學研究的費用，約為美國四分之一·就是比我們要多五十倍。我們的人口，比美國要多四倍，比英國要多八倍我們一切工業學術都比英美人落後一百幾十年。由此可以知道我們現在所用於科學研究的經費，與我們的需要相比，眞正不過是九牛的一毛（完）</p>

<p>— 胡伯洲</p>
<p>衣食住行，為人生四大要素，而衣居首位。攷全世界人口總數，約計十六萬萬，其中衣被全體者八之五，衣蔽半體者八之一，赤身裸體者八之二。近代文化進步，一日千里，衣蔽半體者，即將進而衣被全身，赤身裸體者即將進而衣蔽半體，此為自然之趨勢，故紡織事業之需要，正日在增進之中。</p>
<p>毛絨紡綫者，所以別於絲麻綿等紡綫，在衣服原料中，獨占一席者也。我國古代，衣服原料，僅用絲麻，唐以後始兼用棉。迨近代海禁大開，外商販運呢絨入口，毛紡織品，開始活動於中國市塲，而為我國衣裳增益一新原料　毛紡織之在歐洲，起源甚早。紀元前五百年，英倫三島即知以毛絨製衣。及三世紀，英國之毛織品，在羅馬極負盛名，十八世紀，瓦特發明蒸汽機，最初即試用於蘭開夏之細毛工廠，為近代產業革命之第一聲。英國毛紡織品，因是產額陡增。當時每年出口總值約六百萬鎊，毛織品幾占全數二分之一。</p>
<p>淸光緒四年，即西歷一八七八，陝甘總督左宗棠，以甘肅產毛羢，如加工製造，利可操券，乃籌集資本二十萬元，設甘肅織呢總局於蘭州之暢家巷。廠內有二百四十匹馬力發動機一座，織機二十十一部，每日可製呢二十疋，是為中國有毛羢業之始，亦我國紡織工業之濫觴也。</p>
<p>不一年，左氏他調，甘肅織呢總局旋即停閉。直至二十餘年後，上海北平武昌天津等地，始有新興毛紡織廠設立；織呢總局，亦於是時復活。共後迭有盛衰，直至民國廿三年，除東三省外，全國尙有毛羢廠二十八家，總計資本額三百六十四萬元，每年出品約值八百七十九萬元。其中二十二家均在上海。各廠以資本徵簿，原料復多仰給國外，發展極艱。而近年來國人之採用西服者，日益加多，外國毛織品，源源流入，年達一千九百萬海關金之巨。振興本國毛羢紡織業，以塞漏巵，正有待全國志士之共起圖之也。</p>
<p>記者為明瞭毛紡織業之實際情狀，最近曾隨本館工商參觀團，至本埠規模最鉅之章華毛羢紡織廠參觀一過，爰將所見概况，略述於左，以供讀者參攷：</p>
<p>該廠建於浦東周家渡，占地三十餘畝·廠屋開闊，門內有花圃，有草地，布置整潔，光綫空氣均佳。民國十八年開始創辦，資本八十萬元。共用男女工人四百餘人。工資按件計算，女工每日可得三角至七角，男工每日可得五角至二元，平均約六七角之譜。</p>
<p>記者等一行抵廠後，由該廠徐先生殷勤招待，領導至各部參觀。以下所叙，為當日所見工作程序之大概。</p>
<p>一，洗毛及烘毛</p>
<p>羊毛黏有油質及灰砂，非經洗滌，不能淨盡。其法，先將排列洗毛機各水箱中，預儲相當之冷熱水及曹逹灰肥皂等，俟其融化後，再加入羊毛，藉機器力輾轉翻攪，毛由前箱以次移挪至後箱。其中油質及灰砂等經化學作用及機器壓榨，滌除淨縱，而得純潔之羊毛。再經烘機使其乾燥，即可施第二步工作。烘毛機共有三部，每日可洪毛五千磅。</p>
<p>二，混毛及彈毛</p>
<p>以織物之種類色澤及成本適合於市價關係，往往混合雜色羊毛或其他綫維，而施以混毛及彈毛工程，其法，先用一種毛，平舖地上，加相當油類，再舖其他羊毛或纖維於其上，如是依次將應配合之毛舖齊經開毛機彈開混合，以納入梳毛機。</p>
<p>三，梳毛</p>
<p>梳毛工程，為毛羢紡織工程中最重要且最困難者，偶有缺點，其影響即及於全部。其法，用鋼絲機，以三部為一組，羊毛經過第一部鋼絲機，加以梳刷捲取等工作，去其纖維過短不能紡紗之廢毛而成毛網，再經二部三部鋼絲機，、以同樣而更細密之工作，得相當粗細之條子，使之捲於木棍上，即可移置於紗織。</p>
<p>四，紡紗</p>
<p>紡紗者，即將統毛工程所得之毛條，紡之成所需要之支數，幷使之捲於一定紙管之上，以備織造之用。所紡毛綫，粗者三支，供製地毯用；細者十四支至十八支或二十支不等。</p>
<p>五，織造</p>
<p>織造工程，先將經紗經過絡紗，牽經，上漿，穿寇等手續，置識機上，用綠紗與之交紐而成經緯一定組織之織物。全廠共有織機六十六部，為德比二國出品。</p>
<p>六，染色</p>
<p>染色工程，因織物種類不同而異其手續。有先染毛而後紡織者，有紡成毛紗而後染者，有織成疋頭而後染者。普通以染毛或染疋頭為多。大略多色者染毛，一色者染疋頭。</p>
<p>七，整理</p>
<p>整理為毛織品最後之工程，其工作視呢羢種類而別。普通分修補，洗呢，縮呢，脫水，燒毛，拉毛，刷毛，剪毛，壓呢，蒸呢，摺呢等項</p>
<p>八，搖紗及打包</p>
<p>毛羢紡織物經以上各部工程，已成相當貨物，為裝運便利計，如毛紗則經過搖紗機，搖成絞而打包。呢羢則須軋頭燙印，然後加以包紮，即可裝運出售。</p>
<p>該廠工作程序，大概如上所述，廠中所用原料，大部分為我國西寗及湖州之羊毛，惟羊之品種及蓄養，缺乏研究，毛質較為粗硬。且雜質及灰砂，多至百分之五十五，至少亦有百分之二十五。故廠內另有揀毛部，由熟練工人專司剔除工作。小部分則購自澳洲及捷克斯拉夫二處，為製細貨之用。</p>
<p>出品大部分銷售長江流域一帶，華北及華南，銷路較小。營業狀况去年售出貨品約三百萬元。今年不及去年之多。同時因受外貨傾銷，不得不將售價减低。現在所出各貨，較三年前，幾至减半出售，不惟毫無贏利，且年有抑越，前途難抱樂觀。又以限於流通金不足，不能大批製造，亦為不能進展之一因。前者為整個民族工業問題，非一枝一節所能解決，此處姑置勿論，後者則有待於主持者之細心籌畫設法加以改善者也。</p>

<p>史高塔杯次賽、兩華昨日分別出塲、冒雨作戰、均未能如願以償、東華對法商在逸園交鋒、造三比三和局、優游對西捕、則在申園舉行、西捕宿將、東山再起、實力驟然强勁、優游於先聲兩球之後、反被連下三城、敗下陣來、殊可惋惜、茲將兩戰祥情分誌如下、</p>
<p>東華戰和法商</p>
<p>3-3</p>
<p>上半時敵燄囂張東華反敗為勝最後十分鐘內被法商打成和局上屆史杯盟主東華隊、昨與本屆在聯賽中四戰四勝之法商會、冒雨作史考托杯於逸園球塲，兩雄相過、因之吸引力大增、南北兩看臺上、觀衆近萬、黑莊莊圍得水洩不通、惟地滑如油、球員均跌得像泥瓜一般、上半時東華以三對二佔先、易位後、東華攻勢殊猛、惜良機屢失、於最後十分鐘內、竟被法商造成平均、裁判陳吉祥、戰情如下、</p>
<p>胡茄聲報敵燄囂張</p>
<p>兩隊相對戰爭即發、法商會實力平均、虎視耽耽、不可一世、小華特率師犯我國境、中綫左傳、鮑休脫、伺候鬥下、一觸入網、局面就此打開、曹秋亭怒髮衝冠、興師勤王、李義臣亦步亦趨、聯騎凍討、雷米迪鮑琪司趨前捍禦、曹李兩將如玩之股掌、秋亭一個眼色、李鐵腿拉弓搭弦、馬上報以顏色、中綫開球、法商五鋒齊上、東華邊關吿急、法凡笑內犯扣關、潘安擋去不遠、小華特候個正着、拉起毛腿、東華又失一城、法商好勇鬥狠、脾睨一切、四座胡兒、笑顏相向、吾國同胞奠不提心弔膽、更以絲絲雨下、凄凉之極、</p>
<p>幼良義臣相繼建功</p>
<p>東華健兒眼見敵燄囂張、楚歌四逼、全軍將士個個用命、以顯我大中華之英雄本色、李義臣義旗東指、四座觀衆均吶喊助威、到達相當地點、李將軍避過鮑琪司、傳給幼良、幼良即拉起一脚、二對追成平局、東華經此奮興、後防堅如鐵閘、法商雖勇、亦不能耀武揚威、曹秋亭左執鞭弭、右屬槁鍵、邊陲起義、直撰敵防、李義臣左輔各弼、聯翻東顧、雷米狄抗拒王師、曹李輕巧避過、迨兵臨敵壘、秋亭一脚傳中、義臣舉足直射、恰切橫木、向賽仲雖有萬手千身、亦祇得東手待斃、三對二東華顯出盟主威風、結束上半時、</p>
<p>法商臨終造成和局</p>
<p>濘檬過後、東華攻勢極盛、十分鍊內、屢闖敵陣、均以塲地濘滑、失諸交臂、最可惜者、在十五分鐘時、幼良右角逞攻、白賽仲躍接未着、不幸適中橫木彈出、東華眼見法商怙惡不悛、屢犯邊關、王師壓境、又遭抗拒、乃以五鋒齊進、法商內無接濟、外乏援兵、派克趕上捍禦、白賽仲奮勇撲救、逼成角球、此時東華佳機屢失、球民莫不同聲浩歎、大半時間、已經過去、平平穩穩、各無進展、東華擬保勝局、改攻為守、不幸惡運臨頭、中樞腹地、驟吿緊急、胡騎雜踏、形勢混亂、幸敵鋒幾度叩門、均被擋出、但最後大華特在右角遙射、鮑休脫暗伺城下、頭頂入網、竟造成和局、東華拚命反攻、戴麟經單騎直入、以操之過急、偏而未中、嗣後大勢已去、秋事又負傷出塲、相持不久、鳴金收軍、東華以最佳局面、竟成三對三之比、各無勝負了結</p>

<p>優洲敗於西捕</p>
<p>三…二</p>
<p>上半時優游表演精彩一路領先</p>
<p>下半時西捕三軍用命反攻得利</p>
<p>西聯會史高塔盃賽優游對西捕、昨日下午三時仍冒雨於申園舉行雙方各擁堅甲利兵賽來旗鼓相當、精彩百出、上半時優游以二對一佔先、下半時西捕反攻、連獲二球、反敗為勝、總結果三對二西捕凱旋、</p>
<p>勢燄逼人連獲二球</p>
<p>三時正、雨尙淅瀝不停、雖塲地潮濕、而雙方戰士、仍準時到塲、傑林銀笛聲起、雙方佈陣而戰、優游先取攻勢、鍾育祥撥球領導輸運前方為軋許半途攔截、小黑炭邊陲入寇、連闖三關、對准敵門猛然掃射曼因守禦無法、隨開紀錄、優游得利後、士氣大振、氣燄萬丈、不可一世、鍾育祥統領三軍、浩浩蕩蕩、勢如破竹、逼入敵人腹地、蕭脫擋駕有功、化險為夷、沈世琦斜裏衝出、傳球中央、劉始讚按住來球、建奇功而返、</p>
<p>西捕反攻扳回一城</p>
<p>西捕連失一陣、乃抱必死之志、人人拚命、局勢為之大變、前鋒五將、旁襲側擊、銳不可擋、時在優游腹地、與風作浪、當時險象環生、四將衛理見屢次襲陣、均未得利、怒髮衝冠、不顧利害、單槍匹馬、陷入敵營、果被其一舉成功、奪回一球、西人得彩後、如射興奮之劑、軍容大振尤以衛理好爾二敵將、最為驍與、屢有良好表演、惜因脚頭欠準、徒費心力、未幾、蕭脫犯規、判罰十二碼、小黑炭主踢球中守門身上、時問巳届、優游上半時以二對一占勝、</p>
<p>西捕拚命反敗為勝</p>
<p>檳檬過後、易地冉戰、西捕抱破釜沉舟之决心、猛力反攻、前鋒聯袂衝陣、球時在優游門前盤旋、衛理突然在優游門前舉起毛腿猛射、球雖中門柱彈回、但小張巳嚇得魂魄失所、衛理並不氣餒、冉接再厲、截得許竟成來球、勇往直前奮不顧身、一記回馬槍幸張榮才臥地撲出、好爾趕上、坐守漁利、迭成和局、此時優游軍心煥發、五前鋒往來衝突、如入無人之境無奈鵠的欠準、均未建功、反見敵將沃克萊棄虛進襲、與傑克一搭一擋、大刀闊斧、運下三道防綫、張榮才見勢不佳、奔出救駕、傑克暗傳奎凱萊暗放冷箭、幸球越門不入、未遭毒手衛理崛起中原、再度起義、十五碼處又放强弩、小張心荒意亂、離門搶刦、但球巳側身而過、滾滾入網、小黑炭怒髮皆目、誓雪此恥、下總攻擊令、沈鍾兩將、埋伏邊境、趁勢刦營、果然敵將中計、離防他去、沈鍾伺隙包團、奈球運欠通、在十二碼處、三過敵門而不入、是為優游失敗之因、此時離終了時間祇九分鑛西捕乃改變戰策、專守而不攻、並　踢野球、延宕時間、致優游永　雪恥之望、總結果以三對二敗於西捕、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<h3 id="c182">經濟建設聲中的國民消費問題 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 程尙林</p>
<p>一　引言</p>
<p>近來經濟論壇上爭論的焦點非常的多。槪括的言及，有經濟建設行程中的重工與重農的問題，通貨膨脹與貶低銀值的貨幣問題，入超與中國利害問題，白銀外流是否由於國際貿易入超的根本原因問題。這四個問題，關於第一欵國內討論的人很多，我個人，也曾在統制經濟建設與農村復興民族復興，註（一）及都市疲憊農村破產原因之一考察及其對策，註（二）兩文中一再評述，這裏恕不多贅。關於（二）（三）（四）三欵，亦當另有文字解釋，現在，我特地裏提出一個問題來討論，這就是：本文標題上所寫的「經濟建設聲中的國民消費問題。」</p>
<p>二　問題提起的原因</p>
<p>雖然目前中國經濟論壇上爭論的焦點，非常的多，但有一點意見，却是大衆一致的，這便是關於中國經濟建設進行，是刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>例如：重工派的主張，認為救中國的當務之急，是工業建設。而重農派的主張，雖然認為救中國是要從鄉村運動普及敎育着手。但對於工業科學建設，除了感嘆於國力一時難以辦到以外，也不敢明目張膽的再提出其他反對的理由來。不寗如此，而且在遇有機會足可以施用科學的時候，總還是極力採用科學方法的。河北定縣用新式手術畜猪養雞，山東鄒平之缺乏電燈，便會聯想到科學人材之缺乏。註（三）即是一例。此外如趙蘭坪先生，雖然不承認「貿易入超為白銀外流的根本原因」，但也承認「一切產業為外人所有是中國之大患。」註（四）顧季高先生雖然認為「貿易入超並不一定與中國有害，」但也主張利用外資建設「內地工業區」。註（五）又足為此點說明。此外再如中日提携聲中，日人方面主張開發華北，美國經濟考察團回國後亦主張援助中國開掘富藏。註（六）又足見外人也主張中國物質充實之為必要，雖則其出發點或者不同。</p>
<p>但有一點我們不可忽視的，這就是：經濟　建設的目標是着重於軍事方面，抑還是整個的國民經濟方面。若果依照若干重工派的看法，着重於整個國民經濟方面的話，那末在國民經濟總崩潰，購買力一般薄弱的中國今日，工業品之推銷脫售實是一個嚴重的問題，在久已用慣舶來品的局面下，國貨工業品是否能與外貨爭長，又是一個問題。</p>
<p>因此本題是特地裏提出來討論了。</p>
<p>三　消費問題的意義</p>
<p>關於中國經濟建設時問題之待解答者正多，本來不止一個消費問題。例如：經濟建設時之資本或利用外資問題，但「資本」兩字，實質的說，僅能包括於土地，勞力，原料，三種範圍。然而在中國境內來談經濟建設，所謂土地者，當然不成問題。勞力嗎？中國的敎育是書本上的智識，缺乏專門的技術工程人員確是真的。但這僅係居勞力部份中的少數成份，外國人材的借用，只要沒有他人從中阻撓，更其是要僱傭性質，用得其當，那也是不成問題。至於多數的勞働工人，在災難頻年，生死一綫的中國今日，更是不成問題的了。所缺乏者僅是作為生產手段相視的二重資本的機器問題，和僱傭勞工時的工資，——或者生活必須費用問題。然而關於屬器問題，這是介乎利用外資與購買外貨兩者之間的一個問題。若果經濟建設時某種工業的必要所需。非購買某種機械不可。而這購買機械所需的代價，又非中國財政力量一時所能償付，那末掛欠方式是可以的，向某國借欵若干，規定必須購買該國貨物也是可以的。註（七）以物易物。註（八）中國方面吃點虧也是可以的。只要在不損害中國主權，和經濟建設前途有利的原則下進行。至於僱傭時的工資，——或名之為日常生活必須費用的勞力報酬問題，這是可以分作兩面解的。一是客卿方面，一是中國民衆勞働工人方面。關於客卿方面，其僱傭工資酬勞，除在中國生活消費以滙外，若尙欲交他們祖國，那末仍須現貨，這是無庸我們考慮的。但專門人村客卿的借用，當然是成分中的少數，則月修所需酬報，雖比較國人高昂，其支付恐怕也不會過分驚人。而本國工人生活必須資金的償付，這在政府集中白銀的今日，當然可以用法幣支消了。但政府僅集中白銀，並不主張通貨膨脹。為維持法幣信用起見，法幣的發行終有其和白銀存額成為數理分例比額的限制性，若果推論得遠點的話，那末又會牽連到制幣問題本身上面去了。然而勞工薪資的發放，終非有和現貨相等的法幣不可。這也可以算得是生產建設中的一個重要問題。</p>
<p>貶低銀值或通貨膨脹政策之是否能在中國實行，及其效果如何這非本文範圍所要討論。但經濟建設在中國進行時，若果外國機械的購買和專門技術人材的借用都能如理想實現的話，那末在經濟建設的行程中所需的必要費用，如工資，或若干國貨材料的選購，（例如創設煉漆工廠則非收買國貨桐油不可，創設染廠則非收買五掊子不可，以木炭酒精代替甘司林更非採辦國貨原料不可。）之類，還須一筆數目較有可觀的資金的週轉維持。這種資金，直截了當的說就是貨幣在現在，自然也可以說是法幣。但他是介乎「原料」與「勞動」兩者之間而表現的，所以便高踞了「資金」的名義。其次再說到分配問題，經濟建設的目標，若果着重於軍需工業，如槍砲子彈戰艦飛機等等的製造，那末根本就不會分配於全國人民消費之間的，我們當然可以不必替國貨造品之推銷作鰓鰓然的過慮，但，若認為經濟建設是為整個國民消費着想的，那末，無論是輕便工業如日用必須品等，或重工業如機械之類，其推銷出路如果欲到海外去找市塲，那似乎太理想點，若在國內找消費者的話，那末是不得不以全體國民為對象了。所謂消費問題的意義，原即在此。四消費問題的重要</p>
<p>四　消費問題的重要</p>
<p>許多的人把世界列國分作兩種性質，一是資本主義，一是社會主義，這資本主義與社會主義的差別，便在視貨物分配，是否藉貨幣，尤其是經過商業交易過程而决定。關於社會主義制度學說，本來派別很多，有無政府主義，共產主義，基爾特主義等等。不過在目前，在二十世紀時代的今日地球上，能站立支持得住的社會主義制度國家，僅有蘇維埃俄羅斯一國。所以談社會主義，在以權力即是眞實的功利觀點立論，非拿俄國作典型不可，——僅僅只一個社會主義國家，便無從再劃分了。關於資本主義國家，從私有財產制度這點立論，那末除了蘇俄以外，在這在球上可以說滔滔者天下皆是，中國當然不能例外。不過法律允許私有財產制度這點，除了蘇俄以外，中國雖然和其他各國共通。但貧富的懸殊，經濟發展階段的前進與落后，尤其是政治環境的差異，中國却不能與各國，不論諸工業先進國中任何一國相提並論的。因此以貨幣為分配主體的消費制度之在中國社會存在，在中國本身並未完成工業革命過程，且已淪為別的資本主義國家殖民地的今日，實顯露出他的大破綻。這破綻，又和歐美及東鄰諸工業先進國家不同，歐美諸工業先進國，私有財產社會制度的存在，是使富者愈富，貧者愈貧。形成富貧兩階級尖銳的對立，結果非向國外找殖民地市塲不能克復他們內在的矛盾，緩和他們內部的恐慌。中國正是他們殖民地對象之一。但中國則大不相同了，中國是被榨取的殖民地環境，除了極少數官僚買辦以外，其餘國民，是整個的貧困，全體經濟生活的窘迫，蓋中國半自給狀態之不能支持，由於內部的天災人禍者一半，由於外來的資源利潤的榨取者也有一半。因之，中國的消費制度問題，不僅是一個平均分配問題，而是無物可分，無產可共，如何的充實發展物質供給，作全體國民消費的問題。近年來談經濟建設，其動基原就在此。</p>
<p>雖然無物可分，無產可共。但我們還不能忽略了中國是私有財產社會這點意義，所以中國的現階段，固然物質貧乏，不能自給。大部份人非遭天災即累人禍，生命安危，朝不保夕。而少數部份人，因為能從外人搾取中國利潤中分嘗殘餘之故，反可以藉洋貨服用來滿足他們人世的浮華。因此在中國社會上，也居然有少數的官僚買辦，和多數的貧乏大衆的貧富階級懸殊的對立。所以經濟建設實行時其國貨工業迭品，少數富人，因為慣用洋貨之故，是否樂用已成問題，而多數貧人因天災人禍交相侵但這乃是待賑救的需要補充，並非以現貨購買的需要補充。他們用什麽方法來消費分配國貨品服用，又是一個問題。不然，若果是以現貨購買的需要補充，乃係有金錢而無貨物之謂，那末大批洋貨入口正是不耕而食，不織而衣，不勞而獲，豈不乾脆？又何必高談經濟更生，經濟建設？因為在以貨幣為全世界交換主體的二十世紀，受榨取侵略巳達六七十年的中國今日，不但物質缺乏，而且是財政恐慌。經濟建設聲中消費問題之重要，從這一點就可以想像得到，蓋中國現在，正是整個國民經濟窘迫，購買力極端薄弱之時。</p>
<p>五　根本改造乎，片面改良乎？</p>
<p>許多攻經濟學的人都能明自中國現在，不但物質缺乏，而且是金融枯涸。所以他們主張發展中國生產，正是一面在補充物質給養，一面在彌補入超，恢復市面榮華。然而他們在這種想像中仍不能放棄他們一種錯誤的成見。這　錯誤的成見是什麽？乃就是以為只要發展生產，便可以　救中國的貧因，使金融凍結的局面冰解，使國際入超可以中止。但他們却不曾明白發展生產，便可充實物質生活乃是理論上的邏輯，茍生產品不能普遍分配於全體國民消費者中間，則金融凍結的局面，仍無法冰解，充實整個國民生活的計劃，仍不能實現。乃是實事上的必然。照理想派的看法，中國為生產落后、只要發展生產便可推進中國走向用代化成功的路，那末，所有一切旣成的國人主持的企業，都可以營業蒸蒸日上了，該不致有什麽營業蕭條或破產停業之虞了，——偏偏不然，只要翻開日報月刋一看，便知道中國實業是每况愈下，破產停業幾日必數見。這為什麽呢？說受外國商品傾銷政策之影響，固然是最大原因。然而國貨實業生產，是為營業，為利潤而生產，也未曾不是一個原因。苟能以合理的方式，普遍的分配於全體國民間消費，那末縱然外貨傾銷政策，再猛烈一點，但實事上中國實業的榮華，還是可以指日而待的。試將每年外貨入口，及中國本身生產的數量綜合統計，再將人口數字作一消費的比較，便知道筆者所言之非謬。</p>
<p>自然筆者所言，也並不是沒有人注意到。近年來復興農村的呼聲，銀行投資農村之實行，雖其動機為資金無出路，（註九）為政治因素。（註十）但其意義，在恢復一般的國民購買力，刺激工商業榮華，却是一致的。可惜這種表面上的救濟，不能發生根本上的效果。其原因為：</p>
<p>（一）國民創痛巳深，片面的救濟究屬杯水車薪，不生實效</p>
<p>（二）天災人禍之匪共水災，益擴大人民流離破產之程度，談救濟實有不勝救濟之感</p>
<p>（三）政府談復興農村，僅見空言。銀行實行投資農村，為營業性質，非賑濟性質，故有其限制性，不能普及於赤貧之大多數人民。</p>
<p>（四）在以商業交易為消費分配主體的今日，國貨難於和外貨競爭，國貨工廠難於和外商工廠比賽、（註十一）結果縱然能使人民購買力恢復，也原不過多消耗外貨，使白銀益發外流而巳。况乎經濟建設，是緩不救急，直到現在為止，僅聽諸呼聲，並未見諸實行。</p>
<p>這種，四個原因中除了最后一個原因，暫且拋開不談。其餘三個原因，足可以說明經濟建設之消費問題，在商業分配制度的今日，談救濟是不能奏效的。於此，又有若干人較為大胆淮步，提出物品證券制度，土地村有制度等等方法來。關於物品證券，土地村有等主張，其本身的功過是非，在中國現實環境之下實行的結果怎樣，非本文範圍所欲討論。現在，且將這種分配方式，就其大體義理上，和經濟建設時的消費問題，作一觀察的比較，視其功過是非又是如何。</p>
<p>是的，由於西洋文化思想學說的輸入，使若干人都喜歡追求「各盡所能，各取所需」的較理想渺茫的夢然而這種夢的實現，姑暫丟開一切政治的黨派不談，從經濟觀點立論，物質貧困的因素正是『理想世界」實現的大阻礙。</p>
<p>雖然，由於中國整個國民經濟生活之貧困，社會主義的學說，或絞他國人士更易使人發生興趣，這是眞的。但發生興趣是一件事，實事能否實行又是一件事，十月不要計較中國次殖民地的環境和俄國乘歐戰方濃時改變國家制度的年代。但，當俄國施行初期軍事共產主義時代，其人民生活之苦厄，物質給養的貧乏，若干留心世界時事的人想總不至於遺忘的，試問各盡所能，各取所需的制度，在現階段的中國，經濟建設根本尙未進行時期，如何可以實現？這麽的說，則分配的社會化這點，目前中國根本不能辦到，是則商業交易分配制度，仍然有他存在的理由。明白了這點意義，則我們對於土地村有，和物品證券的辦法，會發生下列幾點感想。</p>
<p>一：依照經濟建設充實物質設備的原則進行之生產方法，應該是集體農塲，科學電氣方法耕稼。土地村有或耕者有其田的方法分配，在消費一點立論，若辦理的好，許能抑制地主與佃戶問階級的對立，但於國家發展生產，充實科學設備一點，是沒有幫助的。</p>
<p>二：物品證券制不知是依照消費標準而分發，抑係以勞動能力標準而分配。如由於前者，丟開貨幣問題不談，而係按照每人消費能力而分發物品證券那簡直是理想世界實現了，至少至少，也可以說政府成了一個振濟機關，若干殘廢疾病老弱者，無機會勞働工作或不願勞働工作者，都不必為生活憂愁了，政府的力量恐怕不能這麽辦吧！如果由於後者，那末除了老弱殘廢以外，其餘的人，是否個個都有勞働的機會和技能，恐怕還是一個問題吧！若正當年富力强，有勞働技能和願望之時，却無勞動機會，那末物品證券之難獲取，恐怕也和現在失業者之困於經濟一樣。這麼的說，物品證券之發行，除了調貼現貨之恐慌和限制國民服用國貨兩點不談，其於整個國民消費方式，並無多大帮助。</p>
<p>這可見消費制度，求其能普遍於國民全體中間的片面救濟方策固然沒有。根本改革的方策也難實行。</p>
<p>六　國家資本主義乎，國家社會主義乎？</p>
<p>關於經濟建設，還有一點意義，我們不可以忽視。這就是經濟建設的目的是在國力的充實，抑還是國民生活的充實？本來國家與民衆，是相關聯的，民衆生活苦厄，未見得國家能充實力量。國力衰弱，人民生活必然的受牽制。可是這問題之在中國，尤其是二十世紀的今日，却不見得如此簡單。國民經濟破產，國力也就因之衰弱，這是實事如此。但國力强盛，國民經濟也必然充裕，這話似乎僅有相對的理由，沒有絕對的根據。例證，我可以不必舉，而且也不便舉。但中國經濟建設之進行，究竟是為國家富强着想，抑還是為人民生活　實着想呢？如果由於前者，則缺乏殖民地的意德兩國軍需工業景氣，而人民生活並不能充實的新聞，我們讀了之後的感想，有智者總會自己知道的。目不要說什建造軍艦飛機製造廠等等。即目前國內若干省份建築公路。亦已耗九牛二虎之力，以至於加重政府救濟人民經濟破產的任務則可知純軍需工業發展，不但一時無此力量，且政府也是不忍的。若果由於後者，那末消費問題之不易解决，普遍的社會分配制度之一時難於實行，——尤其是外貨减價傾銷政策的施行，使貨幣購買的商業分配方法亦受桎梏（國民購買力恢復也原不過多少推銷外貨而巳。觀於洋米每年入口竟達一六，三六四，一六七担之平均數字，而若干農村米穀反無法脫售足可為這點說明。）這麼說來，則可如中國經濟建設所走的路，在分配一點立論，資本主義的路走不通，社會主義的路也不能走。</p>
<p>次殖民地的中國還應該在資本主義和社會主義兩者之外，另闢蹊徑。</p>
<p>七　結論統制乎，合作乎？</p>
<p>分配方式在中國之難解决，上數段文字中已約略的說明。但消費分配問題之難解是一件事，經濟建設非急待進行不可又是一件事。中國目前的局面，無論什麼事都是在進一步退兩步之下邁進的。經濟建設之進行當然不能例外。明白了這點，則初期的經濟建設，實是一個最艱難，最痛苦的担當。若干企業，無論其為國營或者商營，創辦時出品貨物之蝕本，甚至無市塲出路，乃是勢所必然。這點若能注意和認識，更其抱着犧牲的决心，以百折不撓的勇氣繼續奮鬥，或者若干年後，則可見到他的勝利之果。問題只在視經濟建設進行中政府和社會人士是否有此犧牲的決心和力量耳。不然，若果藉經濟建設之美名，作商品利潤追求之實。那末現在，國貨工廠之難於支持，正可以說明經濟建設是此路不通。</p>
<p>但經濟建設，為增加國家或人民的財富，而作利潤的追求，在以商業主體的交換分配制度下，實是勢所使然。若國家或人民認淸了經濟建設非蝕本或失敗不可，那末根本便無人進行了，如何能使經濟恐慌的僵局打開？這所以，問題又會轉到統制或者合作方面去，其意義在設法减少蝕本的程度和貨物擱淺的危機。另一面，國家反可以在此情勢下，不正式走社會主義的路，也不走資本主義的路。（其實這兩條路根本即無能力走）。而將形同過剩的物品分配於全體勞苦大衆，而以全體或大部份失業的勞苦大衆無處出賣的『力』，轉移於重工業的經濟建設，軍需工業建設，國防工業建設方面去。正可以使分配消費方式的困難解開。使初期輕便工業的貨物不致淺擱，使重工業得以進行。於國家，於民衆，正是雙方有利。而於消費問題商品推銷問題，重工業建設問題方面說，又是三方有利了。這裹，『私商』的禁止，或範圍勢力的縮小，營業性質的政治化，——尤其是代替「現貨」的物品證券或類似證券的發行，都是實事上不得不辦的。不過，今日中國的國際環境，是否能如此辦，在門戶洞開，租界林立的現在，實是一個問題。而中國的官吏道德人格和能力，是否可以勝此任務，又是一個問題，因此，這種方式，只能從小處起，從鄕村或偏僻地方試辦起。</p>
<p>而形式方面，如其用統制，還不如用合作，蓋統制僅有政府單獨負責，合作則人民亦須參加，我說到這裏，我又懷想到計劃經濟問題上面去了。</p>
<p>總之，消費分配問題之解决，是有待於政府和人民雙方努力的。至於內亂的廢止，長期和平秩序安寗的維持，尤其是賑濟政策之普及和速效，那還是經濟建設進行和消費分配問題解决的先决條件。</p>
<p>最后，我還有一點意見要加以說明。這就是，經濟建設的進行，要集體化，公共化。除國家以外，不允許任何人獨佔生產機關，社會團體。而分配制度的施行，要個別化，普遍化，連政府人員在內，不能使任何人的物質給養分配有過分畸形的懸殊，和不公平消費的事實存在。然而此則在中國更難。明乎此，即生產手段公有，消費方式平均的政府統制政策的實行，又是必要的，不過現在，尙言之過早耳。</p>

<p>— （寗自强）</p>
<p>——我們要提倡小工業——</p>
<p>毛筆，便是提倡國貨的對象，毛篷之盛衰，關係國貨前途·至為重大，自不景氣籠罩全國之後，刧後小民，幾成涸轍之魚，主持筆業者，自不能不受其影響也。</p>
<p>毛筆之原料為麻興毛，麻則購自江西，安徽各省，每斤至少需洋二角，毛則購自徐州，每簍重約一斤半，需洋五元左右。筆桿則購自皖南一帶，成本每枝亦需銅元一枚，然後再加以人工，洗之，刷之，製之，成之，每人每日能成筆三十枝者，卽為上手，薪金當在十元左右。</p>
<p>準此以觀，人工原料，需值旣如彼，故一枝毛筆非大洋四分卽不合算，然而今茲一般購買力旣在水平綫以下，筆商雖减價而沽，仍不能脫售、維持成本，更談不到矣！</p>
<h3 id="c192">燒窰 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>燒窰是我們早經發明的工業，跟造紙，釀酒等等，談不到科學不科學，也早有了相當的成績。一個村莊裏面，只須有人提倡這些小工業，人無游惰，地無棄利，國家難道還愁不富强嗎？</p>
<p>沿姚江的×村，背山臨水，風景很好，村人都以燒塞為業。日出而作，日入而息，却也安安穩穩地度其生活。但，一來因為士壤的性質，二來墨守成法，弗求進步：所以只能燒些磚瓦出來，沒有及得來江西景德鎭的出品。據說，奉化人也能够造紙，出品也不甚精良；這些都是地方上「智識階級」，「有產階級」的責任！</p>
<p>窰要是不寬廣，薛平貴跟王寶川夫妻倆也不能够住了。單把燒磚的窰來講，大概一窰可燒出六萬五千塊磚，談到資本，實在輕微，大概須燒松柴五六十元，却足够用，不過人工占了大部分吧。</p>
<p>掘上河泥，用脚踐踏，使它靭爛調勻，於是把泥放在型中，乾後傾出，聚堆窰中，便可燒了。松柴從窰門投入，烈火融融，穿燒全窰，這樣不斷地燒了一畫夜，便用鐵絲網，稻藁，細沙等物，封住窰口，引水從窰口注入，—據個中人說，一窰須注水六十担。—水溜入窰中，散布如雨，使所燒的磚，漸漸冷却。第三天，開了窰門，裏面還非常溫煖，把燒成的磚，搬運出來，便可應用了</p>
<p>這是最簡便的老法燒窰，至今雖然還沒有洵汰，我以為優勝劣敗，天演公理，快快改良纔是！這也不是燒窰一事吧</p>
<p>燒窰的地方，女人找不出一個；因為窰工往往裸着全身來工作，自然女人避開了。這也是應該革除的一種陋習。</p>
<h3 id="c193">自紡絨線 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>社會上失業的人這樣多，不想方法去救濟，眼看他們因失業而受到凍餒的苦痛，也太忍心了吧。像現代的中國，正需要提倡小工業，原料最好是土產。</p>
<p>絨線，它的用途很廣，原料是羊毛，人人所知道的。從前的絨線都是仰給外國，因為不知道紡絨線的秘密，其實是很容易的。</p>
<p>長興（浙屬）一帶的農民，最喜歡蓄羊，差不多每戶都蓄着十來頭綿羊。此地的農民除了耕種度日以外，育蠶，蓄羊，都是副業，但夏秋二季的蠶都不育。桑葉留養在樹枝上，經過一度嚴霜，就把它採下飼羊。羊的糞尿又可肥田，倒是一個挺好的循環生產方法！</p>
<p>羊的生育很繁衍的每年的冬季，許多農民閒在家中沒事，牽了羊到附近的鎮落上去做殺羊責肉的生意。可是刮下的羊毛很多，現在已學得用羊毛紡線的方法，所以近段農婦都會自紡。它的方法用羊毛若干和石堿屑，再加沸水一泡，另用淸水漂淨，晒乾後，隨意染色。紡線的手續，用舊時打綿線的器具，方法雖然是很笨拙，不過婦女沒有事，拿這種當作玩意兒，也是提倡土產小工業的善法，並希望大家來實騐吧！</p>

<h3 id="c194">宜興陶器 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>蘇　一帶有一句很刻薄的俗諺，叫做「三鈿買一雙宜興夜壺」，意謂「只出一張嘴」，形容只會說話，不會幹事的人。雖然這一句俗諺，並無深意，但「宜興陶器」，確有一述的價值。</p>
<p>宜興陶器的生產中心，是在宜興城東南的蜀山和丁山二鎭。蜀山出的以茶壺茶盃為主，而丁山却生產着大量的盌碟用具。但這不是絕對的限制，因為蜀山的陶窰，也製售盌碟，丁山的陶工，也會製茶具，不過因這二區的主要銷路不同，而分着這麼個限制罷了。</p>
<p>以蜀山和丁山為中心的居民，十家之中，至少有九家是依着陶業為生的。農業在這二區中，雖也相當地發達，但顯然地，農業是不過處於副業的地位。在陶業區中生產的孩子，在十歲左右，已能揑製各種陶器的胚型。的確，宜興的陶業，已有二千年的歷史，陶民們依着取之無盡的黏土為生，可說得是得天獨厚。</p>
<p>從康熙年間，一直到民國十年左右，是宜興陶器的全盛時代，不特風行全國，日本，南洋各地，到處受人歡迎，就是歐美各國的上等家庭，也都有備着一套中國產的宜興茶具或盌碟玩具的。蜀丁二鎭，在民初淸末每年輸出的陶器，平均每年約有二百至二百五十萬元之巨。但是近年來，受外國瓷器，搪瓷，以及玻璃器皿的壓迫，也逐漸地和江西瓷器相伴着，日趨衰落，而走上了不幸的命運之途。</p>
<p>據說宜興陶器的原料，在我國的廣大領士之中，只有宜興的蜀山丁山二地，有得生產。就是世界各國，也似乎沒有生產着生產於宜興的同樣細緻的黏土。所以直到現在，也沒曾見有怎一國能仿製宜興陶器者。但現在宜興陶器是日趨衰落了。江西瓷器，聽說現在有人加以提倡，用科學方法加以改良，為甚麼對於這個有悠久的歷史，而且是獨步全球的宜興陶器，便沒人加以注意呢？</p>
<p>末了，我又記起了一位宜興朋友，從前命我屬對的上聯，叫做「無錫宜興瓦茶壺」。把二個地名的上一字都化成了動字，十分自然，但我想了許多年，也沒曾擬出下聯來。今天說起了宜興陶器，附筆及之，以供一粲。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣姝集議虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>這個宇宙裏面的人人，似乎都有兩副面孔，一副面孔月為了爭名而用的，一副面孔是為了爭利而用的。這兩副面孔同時拿出來，往往就生着很大的街突。程志前隔壁屋子裏那位教訓老爺的太太，這時就是把兩副面孔，一同拿出來的人了。王北海怔怔的聽過了一陣子，却不由得怒從心起，恨不得跳到那邊屋子去，打那女人兩個嘴巴。志前却笑着望了他的紅臉，沒有作聲。過了一會子，那胡嫂子却由隔壁屋子裏走出來，似乎也在臉上帶了一種笑容走過去。北海實在是不能忍耐了，並不先知會志前，起身就向外而走着。直搶過後院子門口，把過路的地方給攔住。胡嫂子對於他的面孔，倒是很熟的，這就站住着，向他笑了一笑。北海臉上還紅着呢，把喘氣的樣子按捺下去，然後向胡嫂子笑道：大嫂子，你又可以分一筆媒錢了。胡嫂子向後退了兩步，手扶了牆，微咬了嘴唇向他望着。笑道：聽你先生說話，也是本地人，我是那種人，你還有什麼看不出來的嗎？北海兩手挿到褲袋裏，隨着又抽了出來，兩手互相搓了幾下，因笑道；我怎麼不知道你是那種火。我要說一句你不大愛聽的話，是你自己的親成，你遠介紹若賣出去呢，別人的兒女，你有什麼不能介紹的嗎？胡嫂子被他這話一頂，倒楞住了，說不出個所以然來。北海見他不作聲，索與把眼睛瞪着，因道：我吿訴你罷。當年西安城裏餓死人的時候，官府裏還不許賣人，賣出去的，為了逃命起見，還是偷偷摸摸的出去呢。現在地方太平得多了，窮人找飯吃，只要不偷懶，總有法子的。你若是再做賣人骨頭的事，我一定去報警察。（三七三）</p>

<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>自從本報的國貨週刊，披露了一篇稻草製紙的文字以後，各處來函，竟至答不勝答。報紙一項，巳有官商合辦的中國造紙公司專造，不久定當出現於市·我們的機器太小，資本太大，可以不必去費心的了。惟有改良粗紙，實在是一條大路，農村方面，專工於造漿，生產之量，增加六倍，一定可能·不過售與紙廠，須要放帳，旣不放心，又無實力，倒是一個難題。閃此想到打米廠的辦法，農村中造出來的紙漿，可以利用我們的現成機器，來巷大家造出「改良粗紙」去買，那就容易實現成功。我們中國四萬五千萬人，只有在襁褓中不必用紙，不論男女老幼，貧富貴賤，可以說得沒有一人沒有一天不要用紙的。只可惜是手工抄成的紙，因為耗費光陰，太不經濟，而且所投資本太不容易周轉，因而價值昂貴，萬不能與機製的爭衡。即就粗紙而言，近年來的趨向已都改用冲水圓桶，上海靑島的住戶，已莫不摒業國產粗紙，改用捲筒式的坑紙。但因價亦不廉，每卷只能抵到一百張，需洋一角以上，於是虹口店當，賣出一種灰色坑紙來了。他是用油字紙造的，核價要廉一半，所以不久的將來，富陽草紙，必歸淘汰無疑。而在江西方面產的坑紙，叫做正西，則比富陽草紙尤昂，如何能與競爭？因此我們非要趕緊改良不可。要想內地各處，改用機製，一時斷乎不能，與其徒作空談，不如大家來起而實行，來用分工合作的方式，那就輕而易舉，雙方都能放膽而不必担心。爰定簡單的方法如左：</p>
<p>（一）凡以自造之紙漿，不論是稻草或是麥桿做的草漿，或是樹皮做的木漿，或是普通的竹漿，不用漂白，不必成紙，只要淹過晒乾，做成豆餅一般的東西，（其實不乾也行，不過運費加重了，怕不合算，）就可以送到我們廠裹來，用機器加工造紙。最容易變錢的，要算是「改良粗紙」了，每一噸料，可以包造「正西」式的坑紙八十捆（每捆二十二刀，每刀一百十張，）祇收工資三十六元外費四元·市上的「正西」價格，在兩年前，賣到每塊二元六角，因為有了灰色坑紙，比他便宜，所以逐步跌價，現在跌到每塊一元二角，就是次一檔小一些的「小西，」也要賣到一元一塊。他是用手工去一張一張撈的，簡直連飯錢撈不出呢。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c199">輸血講述 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 佐伯重治　宗澤譯</p>
<p>操術正當不生危險</p>
<p>—血液保存廿五日尙有効—</p>
<p>應用廣泛</p>
<p>所謂輸血，就是從供給血液的人——給血者——的體內，依其血液之能營其全機能為限度，採取其儘可能量的血液，再把這輸送給需要血液的人——受血者——的血管內之稱謂，這種血液的授受，並不是任意可以施行於人與人之間，若用不適合的血液彼此授受，受血者往往有喪失生命的危險，所以血液的適合，在輸血的關係上是非常重要的。</p>
<p>血液型　血液的大體，可以分為血球（有形成份）和血淸（液狀成分）兩種，然現在多數人的血球和血淸是分離看的，譬如說，其中二人，甲的血球和乙的血淸是混合的，又甲的血淸和乙的血球也混合時，那末所謂凝集反應的現象只起於前者而不起於後者，再若另外二人，乙和丙而混合時，反應現象便不起於前者而起於後者，若甲和丙混合就兩者都起反應，丙和丁混合就兩者都不起反應等等不一的凝集反應現象是因人而異的。在念餘年前，有學者數人，就多數人的凝集反應檢査之結果，確定人類的血液，分類為四血型，這四種血型的名稱叫做O型A型B型AB型，其中卽使以同型的人的血混合起來，也不起疑集反應，把這不起反應的彼此間的血液來輸血是絲毫不會發生危險，由多方的經騐血明曉了的，卽同型的血液固然適於輸血，但卽使以異型者問血液輸血，也發現並無妨礙，又在理論上已被容認了的，卽如以〇型的血液可以輸血於其他血型（A·B·AB）的人，又AB型的血液也可以輸送給其他血型（A·B·C·）的人。</p>
<p>給血者　除了血液的適合之外，給血者的必要條件，還需要健康，因輸血而會引起病毒傳染的血液當然是要不得，最有効而適當的莫若健康而生活力旺盛的壯年人的血，若是且可免除給血者於採血時所蒙的影響，因為給血者須被　去多量的血，若給血者的血壓甚高，則施行採血非但無害於身體，且可除去其特殊狀態，於衰弱和貧血的人身上施行採血是很危險的。從多數的經騐和實騐上探知，凡健康者的身體體重每一基羅可採取一〇格蘭姆以內的血——若體重有五〇基羅的（約十三貫）可採取五〇〇格蘭姆以內的血，這樣卽使連續每月一次的採血，亦無害於給血者的身體，大抵輸血所需的血自一〇〇格蘭姆乃至三〇〇格蘭姆（最高五〇〇格蘭姆）的血量。</p>
<p>輸血的目的　這種輸血的方法，適用於何等樣的病症呢？當我們在遇到外傷，胃十二指腸潰瘍，肺桔核，痔核，分娩，子宮外姙娠中絕等症，結果患者有大出血而發生生命危險的時候，第一需要血液的補充，這是誰都能想得到的一着。因為在急激的大量出血之後，血壓頓時下降，這種血壓的下降是能威脅患者自身的生命，所以在動用手術或講究止血法以及劃策其他種種方法之前，最緊要的着眼處便是使患者血壓的增高，在這目的上，輸血可說是最良好的方法，其次像大出血之後的貧血症，胃十二指腸潰瘍，胃癌，腸癌，子宮癌，子宮筋腫，痔核，肺桔核等病症，因慢性出血所引起的貧血，又如傳染病，寄生虫病，各種藥品中毒等症因毒素的作祟而引起的貧血，以及其他種種的貧血，更在血薄者之欲使血液濃厚等等的目的上，都可施用輸血方法，而在慢性出血的塲合尙含有止血的意義。</p>
<p>已經注入體內的血液，有刺戟造血器管與促進血液新生的作用，譬如說，胃癌患者，從病勢上而度察，當以割除其癌為根治之療法，但若患者體力衰弱而不能動過强的手術時，我們通常施以數回的輸血方法，使患者體力加增之後，然後再動用大手術而達到根治癌症的目的。此外如血支病患者在出血時因血液缺乏凝固性而一時不易止住，像這樣的人若常行輸血方法，亦有相當之效果，這是因為健康者的血液內有凝固血液的必要物質存在着的綠故。</p>
<p>輸血也能適用於敗血，急性腹膜炎，急性骨髓炎，蜂窠織炎，丹毒，腸實扶斯，赤痢，疫痢等的急性傳染疾病，因為這些病症的起因是由於毒素在人體內破壞多數赤血球的緣故，若用輸血方法，可使補充赤血球之不足，同時也可以破壞體內存在着的毒素，和殺减血液中的微菌等的功能。在這抗毒和抗菌的目的上，更進一步使發揮其效用的方法，稱做免疫輸血，卽如使與患者有樣病程之經過，採用將在恢復期患者的血液來輸血，或豫期對給血者施免疫注射，都可增高其免疫性，因為在恢復期的人的血液中含着多量免疫物質的緣故。此外如火傷，子癎，惡疽，石炭瓦斯中毒，葺中毒，以及其他各種藥品中毒等症，輸血亦能奏其效用，在對付傳染病或中毒症患者，可先使其瀉血（須事前預備血液），然後再施以輸血，若是更著效果——而另外一方面要說到輸血的有沒有危險問題上來。</p>
<p>輸血的副作用　若選擇血液沒有錯誤，輸血方法正當而直接因輸血招致死亡的，可說是絕無僅有的事，但也不能說全然無副作用，把極輕微的也一併算入在內，大約有百份之二十起何種副作用的，其較輕的症狀如倦怠，惡寒，熟戚，發熱，頭痛，動悸，眩暈，蕁麻</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>疹，輕微的腹痛等等。重的如惡寒戰慄，高熱，惡心嘔吐，激劇的腰痛腹痛，下痢，呼吸困難，脈搏不良，譫語等等的現象，像這樣的情形雖使周圍的人起萬分的驚惶，但大都是一時的現象，經過一十二小時（最長數小時）之後，患者卽能恢復舊態。這種副作用的原因，雖經多方研究之結果而判明，但卽使操術上絲毫沒有欠陷，往往亦有此等情形發生，且一遇到這種情形有至某一程度的危險性，因此輸血並非誰都可以實行的事，非得依着各人的情勢審愼考慮之後施行不可。</p>
<p>輸血的方示　輸血的方法有二種，（一）把採取下來的血不加雜質直接輸給受血者—直接法，（二）在採集下來的血中再加進拘椽酸曹達，奪取其血液凝固性後的輸入方法—間接法。直接法祇要找到適合的血液，依原成分輸送給受血者，這種方法在理論上說是很合宜的，而實際上也絕少副作用，但因着操作上的種種不便，應用的並不廣，而間接法因為可以防止血液凝固的緣故，辦理的成績要良好得多，而其效果較之直接法亦並無多大差別，故目前大多數主用此法。此外如加有拘椽酸曹達的血液，可保存於冷藏庫內至若十時期，且若運往遠地輸血亦為可能之事，關於血液保存的時期，大抵二十五日以內的保存血，仍有相當的效果，這是最近研究的結果。</p>
<p>又若血液一旦變成乾燥的粉末時，可於臨用時溶解成液狀之後再行輸入，這便是所謂乾燥血輸血方法，這樣雖與眞實的輸血意義稍有差異，但至少亦能達到輸血一部份的目的。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（問）什麽叫做血蛭病？</p>
<p>（答）這是一種吸蟲寄生於人體肝門脈血管中的病。後前是因為日本有幾處地方流行這種病、，所以特稱為日本寄血吸蟲病。近來我國也有幾處地方發見這種寄生蟲病。</p>
<p>（問）這種吸蟲，怎樣會侵入人體呢？</p>
<p>（答）是從皮膚穿入人體內或從飮料水喝進去的。</p>
<p>（問）血蛭在侵入人體之前，是寄生在那裏的？</p>
<p>（答）他們的中間宿主是一種海螄。</p>
<p>（問）血蛭的身體有多少大小？</p>
<p>（答）雄蟲長約十五至十六公厘（合市尺四分至半寸）雌蟲長約十九至二十一公厘（合市尺六七分）而雌蟲比雄蟲細得多。</p>
<p>（問）患了血蛭病的人，身體器官起什麽影響？</p>
<p>（答）人體直接受影響的是肝臟。肝臟初腫大，後萎縮硬化。表面生小丘狀隆起和陷沒。有時因為蟲卵經大靜脈而到肺內，於是肺臟也起和肝臟相同的變化。其他脾臟也腫大，大小腸的黏膜發炎腫脹，或成小潰瘍。</p>
<p>（問）患了血蛭病的人，起什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）血蛭病的狀有急性和慢性型二種。</p>
<p>（問）急性型的病狀是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）局部有瘙癢性皮膚炎，尤多見於下肢。傳染後約二星期先起全身倦怠，食慾不振，腹痛等前驅症狀；經三星期，因為蟲產卵子於腸壁的門脈枝而呈急性腸炎或蚓突炎狀，有時發熱，肝臟腫脹。</p>
<p>（問）慢性型的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）有的因為急性型的反復而變慢性，有的初起就成慢性，肝臟漸漸腫大而硬固，生壓痛。等到病勢進行，那末肝臟縮小，其表面可以觸知大小種種的顆粒。同時有貧血和消化障碍，胃部疼病，腹部膨滿，心悸亢進，和呼吸困難，有時起水腫，腹水或黃疸，胃腸出血等病狀。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣診斷，可以確定是血蛭病？</p>
<p>（答）若在流行地方而遇到有肝臟腫大，粘膜出血，和門脈鬱血病狀的時候，就可慮到本病。在糞便中證明蟲卵那更確實。</p>
<p>（問）應當和那幾種病相區別？</p>
<p>（答）應當和斑替氏病，林奈克肝硬變相區別。</p>
<h3 id="c201">牙齒常識問答（十二） <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第六六問）屬於全身的助因有幾種？</p>
<p>（答）屬於全身的助因，可以分做先天的和後天的二層。先天的就是關於遺傳性自已不能為力的。譬如父母身體虛弱，抵抗力薄，或是父母牙齒不健全，為兒子的牙齒，也會脆弱，無抵抗力，極易生蛀。後天的方面，可以說凡是生活失常，可以减低身體抵抗力的，都可誘起蛀牙。尤其是下列幾種原因，更為顯著：（一）營養障礙，身體衰弱，而致石炭質退化。（二）食物中滋養料不足，缺乏燐質，鈣質，維他命等。（三）患肺病，花柳病，傷寒，新陳代謝病如糖尿病等。（四）唾液變當，失却鹹性，不能中和乳酸及防止微菌的發育。（五）姙娠時期石炭質的消失。</p>
<p>（第六七問）牙齒那一部分最易生蛀？</p>
<p>（答）凡是牙齒面上凹處，和牙磁發育不完全的地方，如臼牙咬合面上溝漕，及其他面上的凹紋和小穴等，最易生蛀。又如兩只鄰牙中間的縫隙，牙頸的周圍靠近牙肉的地方，亦極易蛀；因為這些地方，磨擦不易及，刷牙不易到，食物最易逗留。又上門牙，較下顎的易蛀。這是因為下顎門牙，適當舌下延綫分泌的所在，能多得唾液的保衛。</p>
<p>（第六八問）蛀牙怎樣進行的？</p>
<p>（答）牙磁的表面，受到乳酸質浸蝕的地方，膠質被其溶化，先發生粗糙。蛀蝕漸深，成為小洞。於是食物和微菌更易停留，蛀蝕更快。及蛀穿牙磁到達牙質後，乃勢如破竹。這是因為牙質遇見酸質，就會軟化，已軟化的牙質，微菌能透入，在牙質內部進行發酵遇酸的作用，微菌酸質，狼狽為奸，因此蛀蝕極快。終至蛀穿髓室，制死牙髓。</p>
<p>（第六九問）蛀蝕到什麽部分，纔會覺痛？</p>
<p>（答）蛀到牙質的時侯，就會有酸痛的感覺。尤其是在受冷熱或酸物刺激的時候。及至蛀近牙體，常會發生劇痛。</p>
<p>（第七十問）蛀牙能够引起什麼牙髓疾患？</p>
<p>（答）最起初的是牙髓充血，再進為牙髓炎，終至牙髓壞死。</p>
<p>（問）這種病危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）急性型，大都良好，經過數星期到二三月便得全愈。慢性型，有經二三十年之久，由全身衰弱而死。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣治療？</p>
<p>（答）祇有施行奎寗和替英爾的合劑或注射九一四號</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（七十二）鼻内異物</p>
<p>鼻內異物的一症。多患於幼年兒童。臨床上常可遭遇。茲將異物的種類及牠所引起的症候。略為一言。異物的種類＝幼年見童大都應用石筆，粉筆，及象皮。或者戲弄鈕扣，棋子，及豆類。所以異物的種類。亦多屬於這幾種。異物侵入的機會。常為自動的塞入鼻內。很少被動的侵入。</p>
<p>由異物所引起的症候＝異物塞入鼻內後。如能立刻發覺。由醫取出。當可不致發現若何症候。如果經過一二日。尙未發覺取出。則鼻腔頓可溢流鼻液。鼻液初為稀薄粘液：繼卽變為膿樣。而帶臭氣。同時感覺鼻腔閉塞（若異物為豆類。則能遇鼻液而澎漲。鼻閉塞亦因此而增劇。）此時患兒的父母。往往以為患有鼻瘤或腦漏。而患兒亦多記卻塞入異物的經過。直待醫師診察後。方可發見異物的存在。關於這一類的事實。臨床上屢可遇見。着者最近會得一例。係五歲的男兒。牠的症狀。就是鼻背部特別腫脹。鼻內流出黃綠色膿樣的分泌物。病側的鼻腔呼吸。完全閉塞。這樣的經過。約有四月。父母以為患有鼻腔的腫瘤。但是診察的結果。發見了一個小塊狀的綠色象皮。象皮的外面。染著膿性的分泌物。鼻腔的粘膜。亦腫脹糜爛。所以為父母的。如果一旦遇著兒童發生一側鼻腔閉塞及溢流鼻液的時侯。當卽注意患兒鼻內有無異物為要。若有可疑之處。應卽就醫診察鼻腔。當可不難解决。</p>
<p>又患鼻內異物的時候。往往家庭中自己設法取出。施之不得其當。常易推入鼻腔後部。以致頓呈恐懼。以為可以侵入腦內。其實異物可由鼻腔後部。經過鼻咽腔。而達口腔。所以儘可不必驚惶。</p>
<p>鼻內異物的治療方法。就是决定異物後。施用相當器械取出卽愈。</p>

<p>— 家為</p>
<p>每天打開本埠新聞來看，「拐騙」，「誘姦」，「遺棄」……等等香艷風流的糾紛與亂子，日必數起，而大學生的要詐欺，作偷兒，以至市政當局，工部局等的每週犯罪事件統計報吿：偷，竊，綁，盜等案的有增無减，正告訴了我們今日的社會病態——不見嗎？日前報載漕河涇江蘇第二監獄的鬧着人滿之患而要大舉假釋舊囚犯至六七百人之多，正是一個最眞實的反應！</p>
<p>報載，更有曾受高等敎育之靑年强盜判處十年徒刑之新聞。據云此靑年精通數國語言受過高等敎育，山東人，年二十四歲，因携帶兇器，結夥三人以上强盜處徒刑六年，殺人未遂，處徒刑七年，褫奪公權七年，應執行徒刑十年，褫奪公權七年。</p>
<p>像這種精通數國語言，受過高等敎育的「知識强盜」，似乎不多聞見的吧？記得數月前，因為大學生作了偷兒，曾引起了社會上一般人士跟輿論界的注意，而作了靑年就業，失業以至整個出路問題的檢討：然在這里，不知將更作何表示？</p>
<p>本來，關于「靑年的出路」原不是一個簡單的問題，而「知識份子」的要作强盜的勾當，却也並不怎樣偶然的。誰都見得的吧？幾年來，跟着社會的不景氣——農村破產，市塲凋疲，百業簫條，一般的勞苦者羣在重重的壓迫之下正是「前仆後繼」地向着飢餓與死亡綫上去掙扎，肉搏，而一般小資產階層也正無可避免地隨着倒退，沒落；同時，「知識份子」也就大批的沒得出路而潦倒……種種，都是不可掩飾的事實。</p>
<p>不過，「知識份子」的作着盜竊的勾當，原並不祇是今日始了，轟動一時的某要人的盜運古物，某政客的私賣公權，以至貪官汚吏們的受賄暗掠等等，都是成了公開的秘密。</p>
<p>本來，我們的社會早經是這樣錯綜地，紊亂地變演着，我們應該怎樣去透視，去認識這些事實而作一個有効的準備！</p>

<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>無題</p>
<p>燈下，聽秋風把雨點輕叩着窗子，一陣緩，一陣急，那蘭珊的秋意耐不住寂寞而嗚咽着。往事又潮水樣地在心坎里湧起了。</p>
<p>但，往事只能倍添愁。愈想愈亂，想剪又剪不斷，……</p>
<p>是的，閒來最怕的就是想往事。不知為的是什麼緣故，舊時的夢蹟總是那麽地美滿，而橫在目前的境遇，又老是</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>這樣的該詛咒。</p>
<p>我曾經把這個老脾氣比譬為惡魔的。那傢伙是壞透了！歡愉的時候，就消逝得無踪無影；而在煩惱侵襲到了的當兒，却更其是給它攪擾得昏沉沉地。</p>
<p>我忿怒了。用着最兇酷的話語賣備我的神經，詰責它為什麽要讓這些鬼東西，在腦子裏搏鬥着，盤據着。</p>
<p>——靜點吧！海沒有風是抑不起浪的。</p>
<p>迷惘間，彷彿有一個輕柔的語聲低地說着。</p>
<p>於是，站起來把燈熄了。</p>
<p>夜是寂靜的。</p>
<p>為了怕煩惱，就閉起眼睛，把腦袋枕着窗櫺，默默地聽雨聲在夜風里嗚咽着。……</p>
<h3 id="c205">寄遙遠的故人 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>小樓今夜又浸在瀟瀟的雨聲中了。</p>
<p>想着在遙遠的南國海島上的你，我又惘然了呢。幷不是為了太息着日子的消逝之迅速；朋友，想想吧，實在是那些昨日的夢蹟太值得留戀。那時侯，不知道什麼是秋天的憂鬱，什麼是冬天的恐怖；我只知道春天，春天，每個日子都是春天呵。</p>
<p>所以，在你走後，我便開始學習沉默。</p>
<p>『慢慢地學習起來吧，從沉默中，你會體諒出人生是為什麽的。漸漸兒，漸漸兒，你更能懂得人間世里是沒有什麼可追求的。』</p>
<p>那個三十多歲的新近做了鰥夫的朋友，當有一天他發現了我正拿着你的照片凝視着的時候，他就親暱地對我說過這樣的一句話。</p>
<p>我之所以沉默起來，是以這為理由的。</p>
<p>但，每每獨自個兒陷於百無聊賴中一，威到左又不是，右又不是，便會把這一所以沉默的理由推翻了。——自家又不是雲雀兒，為什麽要把自己關在樊籠里呢？而且，卽使是雲雀兒，它也不會自家關起來的。</p>
<p>為了這，曾經有過一些時光，每天的黃昏，我就常常的散踱在秋天的郊野上。因此，我看慣了在遼遠的園林那邊的裊裊地漫騰起來的炊烟，也熟悉了那西方的落日底憂鬰的臉子。直至暮靄把四周染上了一層古墓情調的灰惘色的時候，我又拖曳着沉重的步子回去。</p>
<p>也許你會說；「為什麽這樣的憂怨呢？」不，……我只冀望有一個打破這悒鬱的樊籠，而讓那雲雀兒自由地飛出去的機會哪。</p>
<p>於是，我打開了窗子。讓微寒的夜風吹醒點我的迷亂的神經，讓雨點子輕拂着我的臉上，髮上，……</p>
<p>哦，朋友，春天也會像我那麼地，經過一個短暫的沉默着的時間，而從新來臨的麽？</p>
<p>「沒有不能的理由存在的。」——你也許這樣的回答吧。</p>
<p>是的，朋友，會來的。但，你得緊記着：「沒有你，我是沒有春天的。」</p>
<p>因為有了這個緣故，我說不出別的話了。</p>

<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>沈默是可怕的痛苦。偶而抬起了頭，四隻眼睛望着四隻眼睛：呆定的，沒有亮光的，裂開一個苦笑，又低下了頭。</p>
<p>天邊掠過一頭蒼鷹，他伸展着兩隻强有力的翅膀，從這邊飛到那邊，從那邊飛到這邊，是那麽地雄壯而又自由地飛翔着。他的頭頸向前長長地伸着，從硬的咀吧里，唱出了那嘹亮而又淸脆的歌聲，象一柄號角，銳利地刺着我們的耳朵，刺若我們那跳動着的心。我們耳邊響着一個朋友歌聲：</p>
<p>「我愛看那半空里在飛翔着的蒼鷹，我更愛聽他那嘹亮的歌聲！年靑的朋友，不要忘記：他所吿訴我們的！』</p>
<p>熱的血在沸騰着，我們四個，跳了起來，忘記了剛才我們親眼看見過的一幕悲劇。我們掉開了給那悲劇引來的灰色，我們忘形地跳躍着，我們抬着頭，對着那自由而又雄壯的蒼鷹，我們響着粗沙的嗓子，我們歌唱：</p>
<p>『我們愛看那半空里在飛翔着的蒼鷹，我們愛聰他那嘹亮的歌聲！我們更沒有忘記他吿訴我們的！』</p>
<p>我們開始飛翔着，學那蒼鷹那麽地在天邊飛學那我們親愛的朋友那麼地飛翔。我們沸騰着的熱血鼓，在勵着我們自己，為了我們自己的權利。</p>
<p>南方是一團火熖，我們帶着了這火焰飛，從這里飛到那里，又從那里飛到那里。我們都很年靑，我們都有一對强有力的臂膀和一對健的腿，蒼鷹也是有一對强有力的翅膀。我們象鷹，象鷹一般地飛翔，自由地飛翔：飛到無論什麽地方。我們也有一付嗓子，粗沙地喊出了那嘹亮的歌聲，那蒼鷹一樣的歌聲。我們愛聽這歌聲，我們也愛歌養這歌聲。</p>
<p>於是，我們忘却了抑鬱，我們也扯下了那悲劇的灰幕，雖然還是在這太陽還沒有出來的黑夜，我們是這麽地興奮的飛翔着。—我們第一次嘹亮地歌着鷹之歌。</p>
<p>這時侯，我們記起了那剛別了很久的朋友，那象鷹樣地飛翔着的朋友，我們默念着他的歌聲，在默頌着他的健康。我們沒有慚愧，我們便是這樣地用事實來吿訴他：我們沒有在一刻鐘忘記他。</p>
<p>現在，又是這麽的一個黑夜了。灰色的幕又蓋上了我的眼睛，我又給掉進了沈默的柵欄里。我抬起了頭，在天空里我又看到了那飛翔着的蒼鷹，那嘹亮的歌聲又沸騰了我的熱血。我便挺起了胸膛，伸長了脖子，歌着那鷹之歌：</p>
<p>（…我們沒有忘記他吿訴我們的）！（完）</p>
<h3 id="c207">綠和藍的偏戀 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 溟濛</p>
<p>在各種的自然顏色中，我最愛的是綠色，其次便是近乎綠的藍。人對於顏色的偏愛，與其說是理智的，毋寗說是感情的；與其說是可以解釋的，毋寗說是直感式的為佳。所以對於綠色或藍色的偏戀，我不想加以什麼解說，勉强說起來，那或許是基於愛好自然的本性吧？</p>
<p>在房子裏，我喜愛綠色的裝飾。我愛把綠紙貼上牆壁，愛把珍愛的書本子包上綠色的紙皮；把綠布做檯布，也把綠墊做成椅墊。其他的用物，在可能時，我總愛揀着綠色的拿來使用。直把房子佈置成一派的綠色，然後弧坐其中，抽起一支香烟悠悠然自得。或夢想，或思索，或讀書，或作文，都覺溫暖和諧，精神煥發。否則房間如果換成一派赤紅，或深黃淡灰，或其他斑爛或深黝的顏色，我的精神便不能集中，神經一定被紊亂了。</p>
<p>夜間臥在綠房中，睡意是濃而且甜。將睡未睡時，瞥視周圍的綠色光澤，投射眼角，直刺心底，心房像被熨平一樣，覺得異常舒服，於是便能安心地睡去。及至一覺醒來，睜開惺忪的睡眼，瞥見房間裏模糊的綠色，是會歡躍地把眼睛一揉，打個呵欠，悅意地爬起來的。據說寢室的綠色原是最適合於睡眠的，這理由我不知道，但是憑着直覺，我確覺得綠色的溫柔對酣眠最有帮助，便是做夢也是甜蜜的。</p>
<p>基於綠色的愛好，所以我愛在窗間憑視。看村莊的綠林，天空的藍色，是最會刺激起我的幻想力的。我每每會在窗間站立了幾個鐘頭，讓幻想之翼在綠色的樹梢上飛，在藍色的天空上飛翔，直至沈浸入幾乎無知無覺的境界。梅德林克的「靑鳥」，會在我的少年時期中獲得特殊的愛好，這原因現在想起來，似非偶然吧？</p>
<p>由於愛好綠色，便愛爬高山，也愛旅行。因為在高山上才能看到更為廣大的綠色原野；在旅行中才能擴開眼界。遍看異　綠野的新鮮色澤和嗅到綠林的氣味。我爬過的高山雖不算多，却也不少了。雖然各處的景色不同，味道互異，但是那相同的綠林的凝瞥，綠野的職視，和空闊的藍天的仰望，却是一樣地可以得到偷快的領受的。在高山上，綠林靑草的一碧無際，村莊田畝的靑蒼色彩，是可一目了然的。至於遼闊悠遠的高空，更非屈居在窄狹的室內所能看到的吧？</p>
<p>從旅行的車廂或輪船中，也一樣地可以看到碧綠的田園植物，和高罩在藍色的河海上而的天空的。火車或愉船，因為長途馳行的緣故，所經過的山陵，田野，茂林，和沼澤，是　數不少的。從這裏，我便可以儘量擴展我的視綫，而攝取沿途所有的綠色光澤了。至於船在海中，天空與大海同樣是一片的碧藍，那時除稀少的白雲和天邊的彩虹外，差不多全是一派的藍色。則大海對於我的愛戀，更是無須說得了。</p>
<p>因此，我愛海洋甚於陸地，愛高山甚於平原，愛農村甚於都市，愛河流甚於曠野，愛原野甚於房尾。基於色澤的偏嗜，而使我的性情和宇宙觀都全盤勘定了。色澤對於我的影響，可算是很大了。</p>
<p>紅色多刺激，灰色富感傷，黃的令人心情溷濁，黑色使人悲傷，我還愛好和平而溫柔的綠色，和富於幻想力的藍色吧！</p>
<h3 id="c208">水仙 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭雯</p>
<p>父親是個酷愛自然的人，對於花草的愛好是當然的，然而沒有專一的嗜好，是否比陶淵明低流紙一等，也無足論。不過水仙是年年買的，當買水仙時我感到是快過年了，因為冬天才有這東西，又是供人年尾歲初點綴的。水仙雖不會紅紅綠綠的盛開，綠的長葉裏開出白瓣黃心的花，映襯出非常宏偉，決不叫人存一毫歪念頭。盛開着時，還有一絲絲的香味是淸雅地；加上白石子配一隻古雅的盆，極其壯嚴和精神，若說水仙最好用「斌媚」兩字，可以包括她的一切。</p>
<p>到了春快萌起頭，水仙謝了。有人說掛　籚下不讓它潮濕腐毀，明年還是有用，而且陳起來可以醫治一種病，像「三年之其」一樣有用，可是我們老是棄掉的，有一次哥哥照法子做了，不長大又不開花，怕是手法不高妙，以後也沒這種閒性情。我看父親買水仙當然不是一次兩次，年年的心年都事變換着，而且變動得很快的，在這其問父親也像老了一些。</p>
<p>有個時候，兩年不曾看見父親，也不知買過水仙否？今年又看見父親買了水仙回來，但白石子上加了一層南京雨花台帶來的彩石，又顯得新鮮。水仙是年年那般好模樣，自己却一歲歲長上去，父親又是老了一些，為什麽不和水仙年年的精神？我又不知道明年父親買水仙時，我是能够看見它再開一次白瓣黃心的花朶；白石子上蓋一層雨花台的采石，配一隻古雅的盆，連一座紅木的座子，印象在幾條畫屏之下，顯出水仙的斌媚。</p>
<p>鄉土的迷信說法：花的盛衰和一家的興亡有關，年底是百樣要討吉利的，當然卜之水仙的好壞了，只是我以迷信的觀察也覺得並不是，我家兩棵水仙為了所處地位的不同，所判別出榮枯，為了水仙眞正的需要是水和太陽，沒有受過水和太陽的水仙要萎頹而不能生存的。然而烏雲時時曬在人眼前，像沒有太陽，若說我們一樣受着水和太陽的恩惠，也和水仙同樣有精神了。</p>
<p>在朝北的小屋裏，有盆水仙，恤沒有太陽照臨的幸命，漸漸地枯黃了，想起自己的遭遇，得把那盆水仙放在陽尖裏曬曬，讓她不受冷落的苦惱，怒放幾枝斌媚的花。</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Hebei-Chahar Administrative Organ to be Concretely Realized Within Days; He Yingqin Again Summons Qin, Xiao, etc., for Consultation; Song Zheyuan Hosts Banquet for Various Important Figures Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shang Zhen Cables Central Government to Resign</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the so-called "Stabilizing the Current Situation in North China" strategies were decided, concrete consultations were held last night. As a result, He Yingqin and Song Zheyuan have separately telegraphed reports to the central government. However, procedurally, it will still be submitted to an Executive Yuan meeting for approval and publication. If the first Executive Yuan meeting can be held within a few days, the curtain on the current situation can be raised. The name may still be the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. The committee is expected to have 16 members. Those already nominated are Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhentao, Zhang Zizhong, Cheng Ke, Lü Jun, Cao Rulin, Wang Yitang, Men Zhizhong, Qi Xieyuan, Lu Zhonglin, Niu Chuanshan, Zhou Yixiang, Tang Erhe, Zhan Yunpeng, and Wu Peifu. Song Zheyuan may serve as the chairman. After the committee is established, the political, financial, and transportation affairs of the two provinces and two municipalities of Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin will be directly under the jurisdiction of the committee. After the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee and the formal abolition of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, Song may assume the new post of Pacification Commissioner of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Tianjin Mayor Cheng Ke has resigned due to illness, and a successor is currently being carefully selected. Whether the Hebei Provincial Government will be reorganized or otherwise changed at that time has not yet been fully decided. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin telegraphed Nanjing to report on the negotiations regarding the North China situation and the stabilization measures. The reply is currently under consideration here. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 2:00 PM today, He Yingqin again summoned Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, etc., to hold an important meeting at Jurentang to discuss the organizational authority of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. They dispersed after 4:00 PM. Qin and Xiao then went to the Summer Palace to report everything to Song Zheyuan. Zhu Yinyin has recovered his spirits and will return to the city in a day or two. Chen, Xiong, etc., also have important official business to attend to in Nanjing and will return south from Beiping within days. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan hosted a banquet for He Yingqin at the Summer Palace this afternoon and invited Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, Qin Dechun, and Xiao Zhenying to accompany him. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying went to the Summer Palace at 5:00 PM on the 8th to meet with Song Zheyuan and discuss everything. The reporter went to the Summer Palace to visit Song at noon on the 8th, but could not see him due to his busy schedule. Rumors that Song hosted a banquet for He Yingqin at the Summer Palace at noon on the 8th are inaccurate. (8th Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After meticulous discussions by He Yingqin, Song Zheyuan, etc., over the past few days regarding the Hebei situation, it has been roughly decided to form the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, with one chairman and 15 to 19 members. In addition to the chairmen of Hebei and Chahar provinces and the mayors of Beiping and Tianjin as ex-officio members, famous figures in the political wilderness will also be recruited to assist in all matters. It is reported that the list of committee members and organizational methods have been telegraphed to the central government for approval and should be approved and published within days. (8th Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a Baoding telephone call, Hebei Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen telegraphed Nanjing at noon on the 8th to request resignation from all his posts. The original telegram stated: "Zhen, with meager talent, was appointed during a difficult time. For several months, I have been mentally and physically exhausted. Although I have sought to preserve the situation, I have achieved little success. National rights are being eroded daily. Since I cannot find a way to save the situation, continuing in my position would be contrary to my long-held aspirations. After careful consideration, I can only implore the Executive Yuan to approve my request to be relieved of all my posts, so that I may rest my shoulders and give way to the capable." (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said that after his resignation, he decided to take this opportunity to travel abroad to increase his knowledge. As for the 32nd Army under his command, because it is a national force, he decided to hand it over to the central government for handling. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hebei Chairman Shang Zhen telegraphed Nanjing today to resign. Shang Zhen told guests that he wished to travel abroad and would hand over his military power to the central government. (8th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since He Yingqin arrived in Beiping, he has been extremely busy consulting with various parties on the current situation. It is reported that He is feeling extremely tired due to excessive exertion. On the morning of the 8th, he went to Tangshan for a bath. He did not return to the city in the evening. It is also heard that He plans to stay in Tangshan for a day or two to rest. (8th Dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reuters learned from responsible sources that the new administrative organ that will manage the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar in the future will be named the "Hebei Governance Committee." It is heard that it will be handled according to three basic principles: (1) Hebei and Chahar will not secede from Nanjing; (2) Foreign affairs, military affairs, politics, and judicial power will still belong to the National Government; (3) All officials will be appointed by Nanjing. Reuters also learned that the new organization and its personnel will be announced in Nanjing on Tuesday of next week. The Political Committee will have approximately 19 members. Although the list of candidates has not yet been announced, it is widely believed that the following people will be on the list: Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, Shang Zhen, Zhang Zizhong, Cheng Ke, Cao Rulin, Wang Yitang, Men Zhizhong, Qi Xieyuan, Gao Lingwei, and Lu Zongyu. This new administrative organ is not named after autonomy or anti-communism, as advocated by the Japanese side. However, the current approach seems to satisfy the Japanese authorities. It is heard that the Sino-Japanese understanding is entirely verbal, with no written agreement and no official documents signed. Since the Japanese side claims that autonomy is purely a popular movement, there can naturally be no written compromise. Although there are rumors that financial affairs will still be managed by the National Government, it is difficult to know for sure how financial affairs will be allocated after the Political Committee is established. Some say that customs duties, salt taxes, and postal revenue will still be fully handed over to the central government, but other revenue from the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar will be retained by the Political Committee for its own use. The currencies currently in use in the two provinces will remain unchanged. After the Political Committee is established, the Hebei East Autonomous Council will naturally be dissolved, and the Hebei East region will naturally be under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Committee. At the same time, it seems that the Japanese want to strengthen their forces in the Hebei East region before the Hebei East Autonomous Council is dissolved. The members of the Autonomous Council have been very busy in the past few days, rushing to build an airfield outside the east gate of Tongzhou. It is also heard that ten aircraft have been purchased from Japan and will be delivered in Tongzhou within days. The Japanese have also built an airfield in Tangshan. This afternoon, He Yingqin went to the Summer Palace to attend Song Zheyuan's banquet. He has instructed the Railway Bureau to prepare a special train. He will probably leave Beiping for Nanjing in the next day or two. (8th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>— Du</p>
<p>Guaranteeing the voice of public opinion has been repeatedly shouted in our ears. Grand proposals and eloquent debates have never failed to be inspiring and desirable, causing us to look forward to their realization. Most recently, at the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Zhou Fohai and 55 others proposed that the National Government issue a national order to effectively guarantee public opinion and that the Standing Committee effectively improve news censorship measures. The proposal was resolved and passed by the Third Congress. Observing that the word "effective" has been repeatedly invoked this time, it seems that this is not to be compared with the usual empty words. After this national order is issued by the National Government, if local agencies still engage in destroying legitimate public opinion, they will be treating laws like old shoes and disregarding the Central Government. For the sake of safeguarding national prestige, the Central Government must implement appropriate sanctions to annotate the word "effective." How should we, who are engaged in the news business, improve our mind and body and do our best to fulfill our responsibilities, to represent the voice of the people and live up to the expectations of the country? As for news censorship, it was originally a temporary measure. Before the turbulent situation has been completely stabilized, the government does not want to abolish it hastily, and we should show sympathy and understanding. However, the urgent need to improve censorship measures is a reality that cannot be ignored. Now, before the Standing Committee has drafted a new system, I would like to express my opinions.</p>
<p>The motivation for censoring news is originally to facilitate administration. On the one hand, it is used to prevent the leakage of confidential information, and on the other hand, it is also to clarify the authorities' position in handling affairs. Therefore, its target is entirely the interests of the country. It is, in fact, a kind of unavoidable measure in extraordinary times. In the past, news censorship seemed to have failed to fully satisfy people's expectations. Regarding the points to be improved in the future, I believe that, first, the scope and standards of censorship should be determined. Military strategies and diplomatic policies are related to the party and the country's major plans and should not be disclosed arbitrarily. They should be included in the scope of censorship. Other similar events that the government considers necessary to keep secret, but cannot list one by one, may have standards set to follow. As for local facilities, private gains and losses, and trivial issues that are irrelevant to the overall direction, they should not be restricted by using one's authority, to comply with the purpose of protecting public opinion. Second, the qualifications of censors should be clearly defined, and they should be given the power to respond flexibly. Censors should be obligated to obey their superiors and responsible for upholding newspapers. When uncertain events occur, and the scope and standards are unclear, censors must use their clear minds, make a balanced observation, use common sense to judge, and meet practical needs. If the authorities can give censors the flexibility to respond in advance and not nitpick afterwards, then censors and newspapers can maintain a spirit of coordination and avoid unnecessary disputes. Otherwise, when censors encounter questionable issues, they lack the power to release them after weighing the circumstances, and they are not allowed time to consult their superiors. They will inevitably resort to arbitrary deletion to avoid responsibility to their superiors. Such a lack of standards will lead to disorder. Often, news of the same nature is either correct yesterday but wrong today, or released here but withheld there. Some are cut off as soon as they appear, while others arrive unexpectedly without explaining the cause. Readers are confused, and newspapers are blamed. All of this is difficult to deny in reality. I sincerely hope that the committee members of the Standing Committee will make effective improvements in the new regulations.</p>

<p>(London) Today, a group of carpenters and electricians left the famous "Locarno Room" of the Foreign Office, a sign that all preparations for the most important international gathering since the war, the Naval Conference, which opens tomorrow, are complete. The conference will take place behind the scenes at Clarence House, located in Westminster, along the River Thames. The duration of the conference cannot be predicted at present, but it is expected to last about six weeks. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The Naval Conference will open on Monday. The shattered Washington Treaty, as it stands today, seems impossible to salvage. A naval arms race, costing world powers countless sums of money and driven by a surge of nationalism, also appears inevitable. According to the provisions of the Washington Treaty, a conference must be convened one year after any signatory nation announces its withdrawal. Now, as Britain issues its invitations, the situation caused by the Italian-Ethiopian War is exerting great pressure, and the Far East is facing a serious crisis due to the issue of autonomy in North China. British and American authorities have expressed deep concern, stating that the Nine-Power Treaty and the Naval Treaty are related, and any violations will not be tolerated. However, after the Naval Conference opens, even if Japan's demand for equality can overcome British and American opposition and be satisfied, the antagonism between France and Italy will still require careful consideration. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement has effectively nullified the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. France will naturally need to increase its naval strength. Therefore, experienced observers here generally believe that this conference is completely hopeless for reducing armaments, and even hopes of preventing expansion are slim. (National Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Locarno Room Newly Decorated</p>
<p>(London) The Naval Conference is scheduled to formally open at the Foreign Office's "Locarno Room" at noon on Monday, chaired by Prime Minister Baldwin. This room, located on the second floor of the Foreign Office, is where the Locarno Treaties were signed. The room is rectangular, spacious, and has many windows. The walls are adorned with red brocade, and long tables covered in green felt are placed along the walls for the conference's use. Looking out of the windows, one sees the courtyard of the Foreign Office. Only a small number of journalists will be allowed into the conference venue during the opening session, but they will not be allowed to leave during the conference. Other journalists will wait in the nearby Foreign Office restaurant. Speeches from the conference will be transmitted to the next room via microphones, and the full text of the speeches will be recorded by stenographers. All documents will be distributed to the press by the conference secretariat. The planned program is for Prime Minister Baldwin to deliver the opening address first, followed by the chief representatives of each country speaking in alphabetical order by country name. Regarding the language to be used at the conference, Britain proposes that only English be used as the official language. However, due to objections raised by the French representatives, the secretariat has decided that all speeches and documents will be in both English and French, with translators from the Foreign Office providing translation services. Subsequent meetings will be held at "Clarence House," across from the Foreign Office. The British government has rented two floors specifically for the conference. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>The Formation of Opposition Between Britain, America, and Japan</p>
<p>(London) The characteristic of this conference is that the participating countries have not agreed on a common stance beforehand. According to unofficial observations, this matter is as difficult to untangle as tangled silk, and its success largely depends on Japan's attitude. Japan is now firmly demanding that its navy be equal to those of Britain and America, which is the most significant obstacle to the conference. If Japan can achieve this, it is willing to abolish or greatly limit battleships, aircraft carriers, and 10,000-ton cruisers. Britain, due to the need to defend its global empire, opposes equality with Japan. However, it may welcome smaller battleships and cruisers, with a tonnage limit of 7,000 tons. But Britain's current recognition of the 50-cruiser limit is only temporary, and it will eventually restore the old limit of at least 70 cruisers. Britain will also likely advocate extending the age of battleships from 20 years to 26 years, which is expected to be one of the points for achieving a general compromise. The United States also firmly opposes Japan's demand for equality and wants to maintain the warship types previously agreed upon in Washington, i.e., battleships limited to 35,000 tons and cruisers limited to 10,000 tons. The United States may agree to reduce the caliber of battleship guns from 16 inches. It is reported that the United States also wants to have the same number of cruisers as Britain but may agree to the abolition of submarines. The US and Japanese delegations have not been authorized by their governments to handle political issues. However, the United States is deeply concerned about the North China situation, so Japan's China policy being brought into the conference is also on everyone's mind. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Franco-Italian Amity Makes Compromise Easier</p>
<p>(London) Britain and France have had friendly diplomatic contacts in recent days, so France is closely harmonized with Britain on several points. However, France is unwilling to make any commitments until it better understands Germany's intentions. Furthermore, France is unwilling to agree to the abolition of submarines. Italy previously demanded the same number of submarines as France, which greatly angered France. However, the recent friendship between the two countries may make this easier to compromise. Italy currently has 83 submarines, most of which are very new, so it is determined not to abolish this weapon. Furthermore, Italy has already begun building two 35,000-ton battleships, which is causing Britain great concern in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>(London) Plenipotentiaries Nagano and Nagai, along with Chief Commissioner Iwashita, visited the British Navy Department at 10:30 AM on the 7th, conducting discussions in the form of inquiries. The British representatives also raised various questions during the meeting. Plenipotentiary Nagano clarified Japan's policy as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A common maximum limit must be set for the naval strength maintained by each country, establishing substantive equality of naval power. (2) The British government's proposed shipbuilding notification plan cannot be approved unless it is based on the above principle. (3) Regarding submarines, the necessary quantity for self-determination is absolutely required based on national defense needs. (United Press, 7th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The 9th is the first day of the Disarmament Conference. The Japanese delegation will exchange greetings with the representatives of various countries. Then, Plenipotentiary Nagano will clearly state the fundamental principles of Japan, the gist of which is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) World peace is an indispensable requirement for national survival. The Japanese government is greatly concerned about promoting the realization of disarmament efforts to ensure international peace. It has always cooperated with related countries at disarmament conferences and has worked to promote the success of disarmament endeavors. (2) The Japanese government, in discussing the reduction of naval armaments, is always based on the spirit of disarmament, striving not to harm the sense of security of various countries, fully considering the geographical position and special circumstances of each country, in order to reach fair and reasonable solutions based on the actual situation. It hopes that this will become the guiding principle of future conferences. (3) The Japanese government believes that the leveling of armaments is the most practical method that should be implemented at this time. (4) Regarding naval power, the Japanese government believes that a maximum limit that can be recognized by all countries should be set. Within that limit, each country should exercise autonomous armament based on defensive and geographical positions, in order to realize the principle of non-threat and non-aggression. Therefore, it first requests the implementation of a common maximum limit agreement, followed by the signing of a concrete treaty on armaments. (United Press, 8th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The London Naval Conference will open on the 9th. Navy Minister Osumi issued a statement in the form of a discussion regarding Japan's determination to attend this conference, as follows: According to the provisions of the Washington and London treaties, the Naval Disarmament Conference is scheduled to open in London on the 9th. Representatives from Japan, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will attend. Japan's fundamental policy for attending this conference has been repeatedly clarified to both domestic and foreign audiences since the preliminary negotiations last year. It advocates establishing a common maximum limit for the amount of naval power that may not be exceeded among major navies, while thoroughly implementing disarmament to establish the principle of non-threat and non-aggression among countries, in order to contribute to the permanent peace and prosperity of the world. The arguments of the other participating countries are different, so the future of the negotiations is difficult to predict. However, it is believed that the ultimate goals of world peace and prosperity are the same. If this common ultimate goal is not taken lightly and unreasonable sentiments are put aside, and sincere and open discussions are conducted together, then the best solution to the problem will undoubtedly converge on what Japan advocates. This disarmament conference is of great significance to Japan in light of internal and external situations. Therefore, we should unite as a country, ensure the future national defense of the country, and look forward to the true peace of the world and the happiness of all mankind. (United Press, 8th)</p>

<p>(London) According to reliable sources close to US Chief Representative Davis, the United States will consistently oppose Japan's demand for equal rights. It is generally believed that the confrontational state between the US and Japan will be clearly exposed once the Naval Conference officially opens on Monday. The hope of discussing naval issues under the quantitative restriction format adopted by the Washington and London Naval Treaties will inevitably be abandoned. Regarding this confrontational state, it is rumored that the Japanese delegation will refuse to discuss naval issues under narrower technical issues. However, this statement was denied by the Japanese delegation last night. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Government leaders remain very cold today toward the semi-official Japanese suggestion that the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty should find ways to revise the treaty. They have expressed in their personal capacities that there is no reason to amend the treaty, and they believe that even after revision, it cannot change the actual situation in China. It would only legalize Japan's actions and intentions in Manchuria and North China, which are currently considered here to be violations of the treaty and other related treaties regarding China. Some believe that the remarks of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's spokesman show that Japanese leaders are gradually feeling the pressure from Britain and the United States. In addition, the League of Nations' attitude toward Italy's breach of treaty is becoming increasingly tough. Secretary of State Hull's statement, requesting that other signatory nations jointly assert their rights and demand compliance with all treaties, is considered here to be a direct action that aroused the interest of various countries in the Far Eastern situation, so that the League of Nations can also pay attention to Japan. Authoritative sources claim that without the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty, naval disarmament cannot proceed. The implication is that if the Nine-Power Treaty is revised, it will disrupt the political balance of power in the Far East, and naval disarmament will become even more impossible.

<p>(London) Last night, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's strong speech in the Chamber of Deputies dashed all hopes of an early resolution to the Italian-Ethiopian War. Geneva views the future as extremely bleak because Mussolini has refused to negotiate. British Foreign Secretary Hoare will confer with French Prime Minister Laval multiple times in Paris today to determine future steps, so the eyes of the general public are now focused on Paris. The first meeting between the two key officials was held last night at the French Foreign Ministry, lasting two hours and fifteen minutes. British Foreign Office experts on African affairs, Peterson, British Ambassador to France, Clerk, and British Undersecretary of State Vansittart were all in attendance. After the meeting, Laval issued a communiqué stating that the British and French governments are in complete agreement on their mutual objectives and close cooperation. The meeting will continue tomorrow morning at 10:30 AM. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British and French talks continued at the Foreign Ministry this morning at 10:30, ending at 12:20 noon. Those present on the British side were Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, Under-Secretary of State Sir Robert Vansittart, Ambassador to France Sir George Clerk, and Abyssinian affairs expert Mr. Peterson. The French side was represented by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierre Laval, Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry Alexis Léger, and Director of African Affairs Saint-Quentin. According to our correspondent, the future progress of the Italian-Ethiopian issue will depend on Italy's attitude. The nature of this morning's talks was largely technical. The intention was to adjust the suggestions drafted by Saint-Quentin and Peterson to draft a substantive proposal. Once drafted, it should be submitted to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and approximately simultaneously sent to the League of Nations and the Ethiopian Emperor. Our correspondent also learned that the British and French will invite Aloisi, chief of staff of the Italian Prime Minister's Office, to bring Mussolini's reply to Paris, or directly to Geneva, so that continued negotiations can be conducted as soon as possible. Regardless of the negotiation situation, the Committee of Eighteen will still meet as scheduled on the 12th of this month. The British and French governments will submit a report on the results of their mediation of the dispute, so that the oil embargo can be postponed if necessary. After this morning's talks concluded, the British representatives stayed for lunch with Laval. Discussions will continue in the afternoon. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to our diplomatic correspondent, if the British and French talks cannot reach a complete compromise tonight, British Foreign Secretary Hoare may stay here one more day and will not depart for St. Moritz, Switzerland, tomorrow. Future talks will likely be conducted by British Undersecretary of State Vansittart and French Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry Léger, along with experts from both countries, to complete the draft proposal. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations deeply feels that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in the Chamber of Deputies has completely cut off the hope of peace before the end of this year. It is believed here today that although the League of Nations threatens to pass oil and coal-iron sanctions, Italy will still go its own way. British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech last Thursday also indicated that Britain will continue to support the League of Nations. Therefore, the Committee of Eighteen's passage of a proposal to implement an oil embargo and copper, coal, and iron sanctions against Italy as soon as possible is now unavoidable. (National Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>British-French Talks Range Widely</p>
<p>(Paris) According to our correspondent, during the Hoare-Laval talks yesterday, in addition to the Italian-Ethiopian issue, the following were also discussed: (1) Relations between Britain and France and Germany; (2) the Air Locarno Pact; and (3) the problem of cooperation between Britain and France in the Mediterranean. Massigli from the French Foreign Ministry on disarmament issues was also present. Regarding items one and two, Hoare and Laval re-examined the various proposals recommended in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3 of this year. (These proposals were: (A) Concluding a convention to limit armaments to replace the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles; (B) Germany rejoining the League of Nations; (C) Signing the Air Pact; (D) Signing the Danube Pact; (E) Signing the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact) and re-agreed on concluding the Air Pact and limiting air force armaments. However, because Germany insists on resolving the Italian-Ethiopian dispute before discussing the above issues, it is unknown whether Britain and France will re-submit the negotiations to Berlin. Regarding the third item, Mediterranean cooperation, Hoare and Laval decided that experts from both countries should immediately hold talks to discuss it. As for the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, according to our correspondent, Britain is now prepared to make some concessions. For example, the country previously advocated that Ethiopia should cede its southern land to Italy, up to 40 degrees east longitude, and now it is willing to extend it to 38 degrees east longitude according to the French proposal. However, there are still a number of difficult points that remain to be resolved, so it is difficult to predict when the British and French talks will have a real effect. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>High Pressure Will Be Applied to Italy</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval held meetings all day today. At the same time, it is learned that Britain and France have exerted significant pressure on Italy. The French Foreign Ministry telegraphed new instructions to the French Ambassador to Italy, Chambrun, ordering him to convey them to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is also learned that after the British Ambassador to Italy met with Mussolini, he also met with Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich. (National Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources in Paris, Hoare and Laval have resolved that the two countries should jointly send a note to the Italian government. If Mussolini's reply does not satisfy the two countries, then the two countries should advocate in the Committee of Eighteen's meeting on December 12 that an oil embargo against Italy should be implemented from January 1 of next year. This procedure gives Italy room to maneuver, allowing it to change its views before the new year. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Implementation of the Oil Embargo Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that some parties in Geneva do not consider delaying the decision to implement the oil embargo to be appropriate. Although this view is not supported by the majority, the repeated bombing of undefended towns in Ethiopia by Italian aircraft has made all parties feel that implementing the oil embargo is an urgent matter. British Minister for League of Nations Affairs, Eden, is scheduled to go to Geneva within this week to participate in the important meeting of the Committee of Eighteen. Mussolini's speech, though it may be said to have not completely closed the door to negotiations, in reality does not want to seek a solution to the dispute, so both London and Paris view it as stubborn. The British and French governments are still determined to proceed with everything according to the peace plan set by the experts of the two countries in Paris. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Cession of Territory Is Not Acceptable to Ethiopia</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that the suggestions of the experts of Britain and France do not satisfy Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's request for the connection between Illyria and Somaliland. According to this request, if it is to be realized, it will be necessary to cede Ethiopia's Harar province to Italy. The Ethiopian Emperor has already notified Britain and France that this is not acceptable. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Although the French Foreign Ministry is not making any statements about Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in the Chamber of Deputies today, they all believe that Mussolini's speech has caused disappointment on all sides. The reason is that Mussolini not only did not specify the minimum demands that Italy intends to make on Ethiopia, but on the contrary, reiterated that if Italy's rights and interests in Africa are not recognized, it will continue military action until it achieves final victory. Therefore, even if British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval have reached an agreement in today's meeting, the prospects for peace talks are very bleak. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources here, a pessimistic impression was formed when news came from Rome earlier that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had no intention of negotiating peace at the time. Now, judging from Mussolini's speech in the Chamber of Deputies today, this statement has been confirmed. Therefore, it is believed that the method of embargoing coal and oil will be implemented when the Committee of Eighteen meets on the 12th of this month. But there are those who say that Mussolini's public mention of attempts at conciliation on all sides is actually the first time. From this, it can be seen that diplomatic negotiations are not without the possibility of success. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini's speech in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday was very short, which was quite unexpected. His speech was warmly cheered by the entire chamber. After the speech, the parliament adjourned until next Tuesday. Mussolini said: "We have reached the 365th day, and we still hold the same aspirations, the same courage, and the same determination as on the first day." Next, he referred to the peace request recently made to him by British Ambassador to Rome, Sir Drummond, saying: "In these recent hours, the atmosphere seems to have improved slightly, but I must warn you not to be too optimistic too early." He then referred to British Foreign Secretary Hoare's statement in the House of Commons on Thursday that he wanted to see a strong Italy, saying that this fact is impossible if the entire security of East Africa and the colonies is not resolved. He went on to say: "The oil embargo, which will be discussed on December 12, will seriously hinder the overall situation. The League of Nations has never implemented sanctions for events that are far more serious than the Ethiopian case. The only reason why it is being implemented against Italy is because Italy is poor in raw materials." Finally, he made a firm statement that the dispute could only be resolved after the rights and the protection of Italian interests it should enjoy in Africa were clearly recognized. After Mussolini finished speaking, the entire chamber cheered for three minutes, followed by singing the national anthem. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The government issued a substitute legal decree on August 23, ordering the Ministry of Finance to raise extraordinary expenses for use in East Africa. The Senate is scheduled to meet tomorrow, and the agenda includes the approval of the aforementioned substitute legal decree. It is generally expected that the Senate's enthusiastic support for Prime Minister Mussolini's policies will not be less than that of the Chamber of Deputies. In addition, a majority of senators, including wireless inventor Marconi and several members of the royal family, jointly submitted a motion that will be defended by Finance Minister Thaon di Revel. This motion states in brief: "The Royal Italian Senate, now united with the national people, unites to resist the most unjust and absurd attempt to reduce Italy's aspirations (referring to sanctions), and reiterates that Italy's actions in East Africa are entirely a legitimate act of self-defense and contain the profound meaning of instilling culture in Africa. This has been solemnly explained by our King Victor Emmanuel III. The Senate declares that it is united with the actions of Prime Minister Mussolini and firmly believes that the Prime Minister will not fail to fulfill his duty to preserve Italy's honor and rights."

<p>Taigeli Province Frontline: Our correspondent Ba'er reports that a squadron of Italian Air Force planes flew to Taixi City and dropped bombs on the camps of thousands of A's troops stationed there. This type of target is fixed and easy to hit. According to initial reports, all the camps were destroyed by the bombing, and the city also suffered significant damage. The bombs dropped were incendiary in nature, and everything within a 50-meter radius of the impact point immediately caught fire. It is said that the A's Emperor was also in the area during the bombing. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>A Capital: According to government gazettes, the Italian Air Force conducted another bombing raid on Taixi City this morning, dropping over 50 bombs. It is reported that the American hospital was hit by several bombs. Our correspondent Gao Yixiong was injured by a bomb yesterday and has been transported to a hospital here for treatment. According to reports from our special correspondent, Italian planes once attempted to bomb Taixi City on Tuesday, having flown to within ten kilometers of the city, but turned back due to rain and poor visibility. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Military experts observe that the Italian Air Force's bombing of Taixi City can be described as the most arduous operation in the history of aerial warfare. Eighteen planes participated in the bombing, traveling a round trip distance of 900 kilometers. Taixi City is extremely high in altitude, 2,640 meters above sea level, surrounded by plateaus of about 3,000 meters. The A's have placed numerous anti-aircraft defense installations in all important locations, and the defending personnel are all trained by European officers. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reports from A Capital, no fewer than eighty people were killed and no fewer than two hundred wounded in the Italian plane's bombing of Taixi on Friday. Many of the wounded have little hope of survival. Yesterday, Italian planes attacked Taixi again, dropping 50 bombs, but there were no casualties because most residents had fled into the mountains. At the same time, the Italian Embassy here, after receiving news from Rome, issued a statement denying the claim that an American hospital in Taixi or Gondar was destroyed by Italian planes yesterday. It also stated that the use of incendiary bombs by Italian planes was in retaliation for the A soldiers' use of Temtem gun bullets. Moreover, Italian planes flying over Taixi were subjected to intense anti-aircraft fire, so they dropped bombs on the enemy camps. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>A Capital: Our special correspondent stationed in Taixi City, Gao Yixiong, was also affected by the Italian planes' large-scale bombing of Taixi City yesterday. Gao Yixiong has now been transported to the capital by plane for treatment. His account of the Italian planes' bombing and the heroic resistance of the A soldiers and civilians is very detailed, and is specially supplemented as follows: It is said that yesterday morning, four Italian bombers first flew over Taixi City and circled for several minutes before dropping several 100-kilogram bombs, hitting the city market, killing seven people. Subsequently, several incendiary bombs were dropped, and many houses immediately caught fire upon impact. Finally, they flew back and forth over the tents of the American hospital, ultimately incinerating them with bombs. Fortunately, the patients in the hospital had been evacuated in time. Only one Swedish nurse, in a moment of panic, jumped out of a window and suffered serious injuries to her legs. At that time, fires broke out everywhere in the city, and shouts echoed. Although Italian planes dropped several bombs on the A Emperor's residence, the damage was not severe. Soon after, sixteen more Italian planes sped in, and the 100-kilogram bombs they dropped mostly landed on the ground more than 100 meters away from the American hospital. At that time, the A troops immediately met the enemy with rifles, machine guns, and anti-aircraft guns, while the police fired pistols into the air, firing an estimated 20,000 rounds of bullets. One Italian plane appeared to have been hit, but it was still able to fly away quickly along with the other Italian planes. In total, the Italian planes bombed twice, lasting one hour. As of midnight yesterday, the number of people killed had reached as many as 50, of which only three were soldiers. Most of the deceased did not die immediately, but succumbed to their injuries. Many more are currently seriously injured, and their fate is difficult to predict. The A people, after the disaster, were able to endure the pain and support each other. Their spirit is truly admirable. After the Italian planes flew away yesterday morning, the city's journalists, together with police and nurses, went to visit the affected people.

<p>Egyptian Capital: British Foreign Secretary Hoare made a foreign policy speech in the House of Commons on the evening of the 5th, in which he discussed the Egyptian issue. Political figures here were greatly disappointed to hear it. Earlier, on the 10th of last month, Hoare gave a speech on the Egyptian issue in a political hall in London. At that time, the Egyptian government did not consider it an official statement on behalf of the British government and negotiated with British High Commissioner to Egypt Sir Lampson, hoping to reach an agreement with the British government. Upon hearing this speech, they believed it was the final response from the British government to Egypt's demands. As a result, all factions across the country expressed strong dissatisfaction and vehement protests. Former Prime Minister Sedky has appealed to the Nationalist Party and the Liberal Party to abandon their previous grudges and cooperate with each other. This move is of great significance in the eyes of today's emotionally charged Egyptian people, and it is feared that serious incidents may follow. (Havas dispatch, 8th) Cairo: Anti-British government riots here today have continued all day. One British official had his skull fractured by being hit. The authorities have arrested 78 rioters and put them in jail. (Guomin dispatch, 7th)</p>

The Minister of the Interior has now rescinded the previous order for the police not to be too severe with the students, and allows them to use force to stop the riots when necessary. After setting fire to and burning the trams, the students saw the police rushing in and retreated into a hospital, throwing bricks from the balcony and using belts to spray water at the police. At this point, the police fired into the air, and the students dispersed. The Egyptian University has now been indefinitely suspended. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Today is "National Solidarity Day." The government plans to follow the "National Relief Day" method from last year, with cabinet ministers going to the streets to personally beg for donations from passersby to help with winter relief. As a result, cabinet ministers have raised large sums of donations, but the overall results are not as good as last year. Some of the fundraisers today wore soldiers' clothing from the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century, with yellow jackets, blue socks, and green hats, standing at intersections, holding bowls and shaking them to make the coins inside jingle. Aviation Minister and Prussian Governor-General Goering begged for donations in Potsdamer Platz. Film companies sent staff to photograph him, as General Goering has a burly figure and a great husband's demeanor. At the same time, the famous actor Willy Fritsch also solicited donations there, competing with Goering, and then Goering went to the workers' district of Wedding to solicit donations, where he raised not the silver coins and banknotes of adults and gentlemen, but the copper coins and fractional currency of the poor. In addition, Foreign Minister Baron Neurath held a bowl and begged on Wilhelmstrasse, with an excellent demeanor and a unique style. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Overseas Chinese Wang Zhenshan Invents a Carburetor Car: Uses Sulat Oil Instead of Petrol, British Government Grants Five-Year Patent <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>China Union News Agency, Singapore: Wang Zhenshan, the owner of the Wang Zhenshan Automobile Company on Juche Road, Singapore, a native of Fuqing, Fujian Province, came to the south at a young age to study machinery, and is particularly skilled in automobile technology research. He recently invented a carburetor car that can use Sulat oil (i.e., the residue left over from refining kerosene) instead of petrol. It has been approved by the British government's four state vehicle affairs department as a qualified long-distance passenger car, and has been granted a five-year patent. According to Mr. Wang's interview with reporters, replacing petrol with Sulat oil in the carburetor car is six cents cheaper per gallon and can travel eight miles further. The carburetor car can certainly also run on kerosene or alcohol. He also said that in recent years, roads have been opened up in our country, and there are many cars, and the required petrol is mostly imported, causing a shocking outflow of wealth. If carburetor cars are used and domestic Sulat oil, alcohol, or kerosene is used instead of petrol, the outflow of wealth can be avoided, and there is no fear of supply disruption. He is now planning to raise funds to return to China to set up a factory to manufacture carburetor cars, which would benefit both the country and himself.</p>

<p>Labor-Capital Coordination - Zhu Tongjiu</p>
<p>I. The Significance of Labor-Capital Coordination After the Industrial Revolution, labor and capital formed a confrontational situation, with open strife and covert struggles, each doing their best. Today, workers strike, and tomorrow, employers shut down factories, each using their combat tools to do their best to defeat the enemy. In fact, labor and capital are both indispensable elements in production, and should cooperate with each other to increase production and benefit society. Now, they misunderstand each other and recklessly engage in strife, which not only causes huge losses to both labor and capital, but also leads to low production, social unrest, and a serious impact on the overall welfare of society. Governments of various countries, in view of this, have promulgated laws stipulating that both labor and capital shall not arbitrarily strike or shut down factories. If there are disagreements or conflicts of interest, they must follow the prescribed legal procedures to engage in mediation; if mediation fails, arbitration shall follow to prevent the matter from escalating and to resolve it as soon as possible. This kind of mediation or arbitration is called labor-capital coordination.</p>
<p>II. Causes of Labor Disputes The causes of labor disputes are numerous and vary with changes in social circumstances. However, the main reasons are nothing more than increasing wages and improving treatment. In 1926, there were 535 strikes, of which 250 were due to economic oppression, accounting for 46.7% of the total; 172 were due to treatment issues, accounting for approximately 31.1% of the total. According to the 1929 Shanghai strike statistics, there were 111 strikes, of which 36 were due to employment and dismissal issues, accounting for 32.43% of the total, ranking first. 26 strikes were due to wage issues, accounting for 23.43% of the total, ranking second. In 1933, the total number of labor disputes in China was 527. 167 were due to dismissal or employment relationships, accounting for 31.69% of the total; 127 were due to wage issues, accounting for 24.10% of the total. According to the above statistics, it can be seen that there are two main reasons for labor disputes: one is dismissal or employment relationship, and the other is wage issues. As for other reasons, according to the 1935 supplement to the Chinese Economic Yearbook, they are roughly as follows: A. Labor disputes related to negotiations with organizations, (1) coordination aspects of labor unions and workers, a. work, b. labor agreements. (2) Those related to employment conditions, including a. wages, b. working hours, c. treatment, d. factory rules, e. work system, f. employment or dismissal, g. shutdown or temporary shutdown. B. Labor disputes unrelated to negotiations with organizations, (1) sympathetic, (2) political, (3) other.</p>
<p>III. Principles of Labor-Capital Coordination The purpose of labor-capital coordination is to maintain industrial peace, and in order to make labor-capital coordination effective, the principles of labor-capital coordination must first be determined in order to proceed smoothly and for both labor and capital to comply willingly. The principles of labor coordination are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>1. Strictly Stipulate Employment and Dismissal Methods An investigation of the primary cause of labor disputes in my country in recent years is the issue of employment or dismissal. Therefore, in order to avoid the occurrence of disputes, the conditions for employment and dismissal must be strictly defined. When factories employ workers on a regular basis, workers cannot be arbitrarily dismissed if they are without fault. At the same time, if dismissal is unavoidable, workers must be notified in advance so that they can look for work in a calm manner as soon as possible, without suffering the pain of immediate unemployment. Moreover, factories must pay severance pay when dismissing workers, which is the so-called DismissalWays. After such strict regulations, factories must be cautious about dismissing workers, otherwise they will inevitably suffer the loss of paying severance pay. Therefore, in order to avoid losses and reduce the mobility of skilled workers, factories will inevitably be unwilling to dismiss workers at will, and disputes can be reduced. Moreover, if a third party or the government comes forward to mediate or arbitrate, there will be a basis for reference, and disputes can easily be concluded in a short period of time.</p>
<p>2. Wages and Living Standards The second main cause of labor disputes is the wage issue. Therefore, the level of wages or whether to increase them should be based on the standard of living. If the price level rises and the purchasing power of money wages declines, then factories should increase money wages. Therefore, if a dispute arises due to a wage issue, the increase in wages should be based on the degree of increase in prices, so that the wages earned by workers can purchase the food necessary for life, to meet the minimum material requirements of the workers. Moreover, whether the workers' food is sufficient is closely related to the workers' work efficiency. If workers eat too little nutrition, work efficiency will decrease, resulting in intangible losses for the factory. Therefore, the determination of the amount of wages must be based on the standard of living.</p>
<p>3. Public Enterprises Public enterprises such as tap water, electricity, telephone, trams, buses, railways, post offices, etc., do not aim to make profits, but to serve society. Moreover, the operation of the above-mentioned public enterprises is now mostly handled by the government or local public agencies, so the object of public enterprise workers is the public or the government. Therefore, workers in public enterprises, no matter how poor their treatment or how reduced their wages, cannot immediately announce a strike if their demands are not met. Because the suspension of such public enterprises is to the detriment of society as a whole. Therefore, various countries have promulgated strict regulations for workers in public enterprises. If they have reasonable demands, they must comply with certain procedures, apply according to law, and wait for the authorities to approve and handle them. Strikes, on the other hand, are absolutely prohibited. Article 4 of my country's Labor Dispute Resolution Law stipulates: "If a labor dispute occurs in the following undertakings, and the matter has been mediated without result, it shall be submitted to the Arbitration Committee for arbitration. (1) Tap water, electric light, or gas undertakings for public needs. (2) Postal, telegraph, telephone, railway, tram, shipping, and public bus undertakings for public needs." The so-called arbitration means that after the ruling of the Arbitration Committee, both labor and capital shall not declare any objections, which implies compulsory execution and prohibition. Therefore, Article 7 of the same law stipulates that "The parties to the dispute shall not declare dissatisfaction with the judgment of the Arbitration Committee."</p>

<p>More Than 700,000 Mu of Fertile Land Still Submerged - The Cao River and Gao Xiang River Urgently Need Dredging</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This year's floods in Hubei Province are most severe in the Xiang River basin, affecting Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan counties. The floodwaters have not receded since summer, and the suffering of the disaster victims exceeds all previous records. Meng Guangpeng, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, departed from Wuchang on the "Ren'ai" gunboat on the 4th to inspect Hanchuan and returned to the province on the same ship on the 5th. According to Meng, "I departed on the 4th, in addition to the 'Ren'ai' gunboat I was on, I also brought the 'Chu De' patrol boat and the No. 5 grinding disc machine patrol boat for use in the disaster area. We arrived at Hanchuan at 3 PM that day and ascended Fulong Mountain. Looking out over the Diaowen Lake, it was still a vast expanse of water, with many villages surrounded, which was unexpected. At 8 AM on the 5th, we departed from Hanchuan and went by land to Caojia River to inspect the Yiwen Dike, the overflow of the southern and northern banks of Hugang Hunan. Although the floodwaters had receded along the way, the terrain was undulating and the mud reached our shins, making it difficult to walk. The scene after the disaster was vivid. There were about a dozen breaches in the Caojia River dike. We then took a boat to Caidian and returned to the province. The flooding in Hanchuan this year is severe. According to old farmers, it is unprecedented in seventy or eighty years, exceeding the highest previous water level by about five feet or more. According to the area measured, more than 700,000 mu of land are still submerged. Areas 4, 5, and 6 are all along the Diaohan Lake, and the fields are still flooded. The reasons are: first, the Usu port breach has not been blocked, and the water from the Xiang River continues to flow down; second, the Cao River downstream of Diaowen Lake is silted up, preventing proper drainage. The water level in the lake is more than ten feet higher than the Xiang River, causing a bottleneck, so the flooded fields will not be cultivated for the foreseeable future. An investigation of the dikes and embankments in Hanchuan County shows that there are over three hundred in total, and over two hundred of them were affected by the disaster this year. The Penggong Dike and Nanping Embankment protected the most land but were also submerged in the great flood this year. The disaster relief funds for the county are provided by the provincial Disaster Relief General Association and local fundraising. Apart from the funds used for emergency relief, there are still over 38,000 yuan available. It is proposed to use 19,000 yuan to dredge the Caojia River to address the urgent need. However, the project is quite large, and the relief funds are too little, so it is necessary for the local people to provide voluntary labor. The meager sum of 19,000 yuan can only provide food. Regarding the lives of the people in the disaster area, regardless of the past, the future relief measures are that in areas 4, 5, and 6 along Diaowen Lake, every household has a boat and can fish to make a living. The rest can be divided into a group of strong men to work at the Usu port, and those who cannot go far can be organized locally to participate in labor relief. In the areas where the water has receded, broad beans and barley have been replanted, and next spring may be able to pass safely after some adjustments. Secondly, the land survey is progressing smoothly, but recently, a quarter of the unmeasured land is still occupied by water, which has hindered registration. Previously, the people of the county registered the land themselves, with only over 530,000 mu recorded. With the implementation of the new survey, over 1.3 million mu have been measured, and it is estimated that over 500,000 mu remain unmeasured. The previous burden on the people was extremely unfair, so they welcomed the survey. If it is sorted out in the future, not only can provincial taxes be increased, but also various undertakings in the county can be gradually carried out. Regarding the issue of banning opium, the government is determined, and opium smokers must be registered, and opium dens are absolutely prohibited. According to investigators, no opium dens have been found in Hanchuan. Opium smoker registration is in progress. Caidian is an area where people from all directions gather, and several privately operated opium dens have been found. The Public Security Bureau has been ordered to arrest the criminals and send them to the county for punishment. The head of the local Public Security Bureau will also be punished for failing to enforce the ban effectively.</p>

<p>Zhan Shutang Flanks Bandits in Haiyang and Muping - Bandits Have Scattered, Clearing Operations Underway</p>
<p>Weicheng Correspondence: Since the many troubles in North China and the rebellion of Yin Rugeng, Hebei Province has been shrouded in gloom. Shandong Province is adjacent to Hebei, and the local security is of utmost importance. Last month, some bandits calling themselves "Autonomous Army" were found in the Daming area, attempting to riot. Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, immediately ordered Rong Guangxing, the commander of the 87th Brigade stationed in Liaocheng, to quickly resolve the issue, regardless of jurisdiction, in order to nip the rebellion in the bud. Fortunately, it was suppressed. Recently, there has been red terror on the Jiaodong Peninsula. It is said that there are more than 2,000 party members entrenched in the border area between Muping and Haiyang counties. After receiving the report, Han Fuju immediately sent Zhan Shutang, the commander of the 81st Division, to suppress them. The following is a record of the various news:</p>
<p>Origin of the Bandits: The bandit leader is Duan Chengzhai, who is said to be a student from a certain school. He is originally from Duanjia Village in the southern part of Muping County. Although he usually contacted bandits, his feathers were not yet full, and he did not dare to act. Recently, taking advantage of the chaos in Hebei, he decided to take a chance. He launched an uprising on the 25th of last month with only a few dozen people. Only half of them had guns, and the rest had homemade guns, spears, and broadswords. Their plan was to attack Tonghai Village, which had a local defense force stationed there, in order to seize their weapons and strengthen their forces. At noon that day, they broke into Tonghai Village. The local defense force, being outnumbered, had heard the warning in advance and fled elsewhere, fearing they could not defeat the enemy. The bandits were disappointed and set fire to the local defense force's station, looting those with some wealth in the village and inciting the poor to join them. They then went to nearby Pingji Town and other places to loot. In this battle, the local defense force of Tonghai Village did not lose any weapons, and the fire was extinguished, destroying only two or three houses. The staff of the Tonghai Village, which is a bus station, were also kidnapped and escaped the next day. Since then, the bandit forces have gradually grown, reaching one or two thousand people, entrenched in the southwestern part of Muping County, raising red flags and distributing propaganda.</p>
<p>Raids on Haiyang: At the beginning of this month, several hundred bandits from Muping raided Haiyang, inciting the people along the way, forcing them to join, and cutting off part of the long-distance telephone lines. Haiyang County had heard the news, and the Third District United Village Association came out to intercept them. The local militia of the county also ambushed them at Guoge Village. The bandits were a ragtag group and were quickly repelled. The militia captured one pistol and one rifle, as well as two bandits. According to the bandits, they were members of the Communist Party, ordered by their leader to launch an uprising on a scheduled date, and the party members had already united several thousand people.</p>
<p>Yantai Imposes Martial Law: Yantai is very close to Muping County. In order to prevent incidents, the county Public Security Bureau has issued a special order to all entertainment venues to stop business at 11:00 PM every night. The street leaders of Qishan received an order from the Second Branch Bureau to close the city gates at 10:00 PM every night and open them at 5:00 AM in the morning, and not to open them at any time. The street leaders have informed the residents to comply. The east, west, and north gates are all closed at 10:00 PM, leaving only the south gate open for traffic.</p>
<p>Han Orders Ruthless Suppression: After the bandits launched their incident, Li Shusen, the magistrate of Fushan County, was the first to report to the provincial government. The other counties also reported to Jinan one after another. After receiving the report, Chairman Han immediately appointed Zhan Shutang, the commander of the 81st Division in Weixian, as the Clearing Commissioner of Laiyang, Haiyang, Muping, Wendeng, and Rongcheng counties, and sent his direct troops and two infantry regiments to the counties to carry out clearing operations. He also issued clearing regulations for compliance. The intelligence fees required during the clearing period were paid by the headquarters, calculated at 200 yuan per regiment, 300 yuan per brigade, and 400 yuan per division. He also ordered that goods be purchased at a price and not requisitioned from the people. Each soldier and horse was paid four cents per day.</p>
<p>Clearing Conference: After receiving the order, Zhan Shutang arrived in Laiyang on the 30th and convened a clearing conference. Attendees included Zhan Shutang, Brigade Commander Tang Bangzhi, Regiment Commander Zhao Tingbi, Laiyang County Magistrate Liang Bingkun, Haiyang County Magistrate Luo Ming, Muping County Magistrate Wang Zhaoxu, Wendeng County Magistrate Liu Chongwu, and Rongcheng County Magistrate Qiu Zhongdu. It was resolved that the local militia in each county would cooperate with the military to block and actively clear the area.</p>
<p>Flanking Attack: According to news from Yantai, Zhan Shutang's Brigade Commander Yun Suanchang, stationed in Weixian, was ordered to lead his troops in 28 motor vehicles to Yantai. After a brief rest, they went to Muping. The troops stationed in Muping also took more than 20 motor vehicles from Muwei Rongduan and went south from Muping to pursue. At the same time, a regiment of troops was sent from Laiyang to Haiyang. Zhan Shutang himself also went to Haiyang from Laiyang. In the two-pronged attack, the bandits were reportedly defeated on the 4th, with a dozen bandits killed and more than 200 captured. The clearing operations are still continuing.</p>

<p>First Army Handles Winter Defense and Bandit Suppression - Xun'an Highway Being Built Quickly - Preparations Underway for Guanggan Civil Aviation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: At the end of last month, the Direct Guard Regiment of the First Army and the Fifth Regiment of the Second Division, commanded by Chen Shuying, were transferred from Ganzhou to Jiangkou, located at the border of Ganxian, Xingdu, and Xingguo, and stationed there. After receiving the order, Chen's regiment arrived at Jiangkou on the 29th of last month to take up defensive positions, responsible for searching and suppressing the remaining bandits and maintaining stability in the area east of the Gan River. At the same time, the Second Division dispatched the Fourth and Sixth Regiments and the Training Regiment to advance into the Ganzhou, Dabu, and Wangmudu areas to cooperate with the Jiangkou garrison in organizing winter defense. The Xin'feng defense area, which was left behind, is temporarily being taken care of by the Third Division stationed in Anyuan, commanded by Zhang Ruigui. As for a part of the First Division, it is currently led by Commander Peng Linsheng to the border of Hunan, to suppress the remaining bandits. According to a telegram from the Deputy Commander yesterday, the First Division has been searching and suppressing local bandits in Hunan county for several days, capturing more than 20 people and seizing over 100 guns, rescuing more than a dozen kidnapped men and women. The remaining bandits are currently hiding in the Zixing area and are being tracked and suppressed. Another group of remnant bandits led by Yang Musen, after being intercepted by the 13th Battalion and the 11th and 12th Companies of the Jiangxi Border Security Force, fled into Zixing. The Jiangxi Security Force has also returned to Suichuan. It is reported that the bandit forces have recently surrendered to Deputy Commander Peng, who has telegraphed the army headquarters for instructions. In addition to searching and suppressing the remaining bandits, the two divisions of the First Army have also been paying attention to the construction of the Gan-Nan Highway. The roads in Xinfeng have been completed in succession, and the construction of the Anxun Highway is being rushed. This road runs from Anyuan to Xunwu, 180 li long, and the army headquarters has ordered the two counties of Xunwu and Anyuan to collect civilian labor in sections to build the roadbed. Recently, the Xin'feng Engineering Team leader was dispatched to Anyuan with the entire team to accelerate the work, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year to facilitate transportation. The Southwest Civil Aviation Company is now with Gan. In terms of transportation, although each highway has between routes is long, and round trips are required. In order to speed up the message, it is planned to set up a Gan-Guang civil aviation line in the near future. The line originally took Guangzhou and Nanchang as the main stations, and Shaozhou, Dayu, Ganxian, and Ji'an as branch stations. Later, because the establishment of a station in Nanchang needs to be discussed with the Jiangxi Provincial Government, before the agreement is reached, Ganzhou will be temporarily used as the terminal, and branch stations will be set up in Shaoguan and Dayu. A pilot and telegraph station staff have been sent to survey the route and find a suitable flying field. On the one hand, two Dingson pure machines were ordered from a certain country's company for use on this line, and they will be expanded in the future if they develop. (December 3) It was found in the Jiangzhen Special Service Team that a team flag was seized, which was in line with the secret report that Xue Juqing intercepted the brigade, Zhang said that the flag was not issued by the superiors, and it was obviously made privately by the department. On the previous day, the district department was ordered to detain Xue, and Li Jingwen fled after hearing the news, and is now being investigated.</p>

<p>The Dongting Xishan Chengjin Coal Mine uses local methods to mine coal, and can mine more than 20 tons per day. However, due to poor management, there are often disputes. The Shanghai Xishan Fellow Villagers Association took the workers of the mine and repeatedly petitioned the governor for the establishment of and asked for a ban, and all the merchants in the mountain that it was not in accordance with the regulations, and there were disturbances to merchants, so on the 8th, they jointly petitioned the government, demanding to stop mining, and asked the military and police to dismiss the guest workers to avoid disturbances.</p>

<p>Chen Yuchu, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, believes that Wuxi is full of private prostitutes, and the prohibition is not effective. He has repeatedly proposed methods such as setting up training centers and shelters, but due to limited funds, it is actually difficult to implement them. However, if this continues, it will harm society and the health of the family. Now it is found that Jiangsu Province has been banning for a long time, and since the trial in the provincial capital, it has been successful. The situation of prostitutes in Wuxi is different. It is not enough to solve the problem by strictly following the ban. During the 61st police affairs meeting, it was proposed for discussion, and it was decided that: (1) Following the example of Wu County, draft various regulations and submit them for approval; (2) Temporarily designate Beichengjiao and Youshanchuanbang as first-class prostitute areas, Wanxiang as second-class prostitute areas, and Dongxin Road as third-class prostitute areas. The sections will work with the competent branches to survey and deal with them.</p>

<p>The County Construction Bureau was ordered to build the Su-Xi Highway, and it had already started the work with the Wu County Construction Bureau. The route plan chart has also been drafted and submitted to the province. On the one hand, it has also worked with Wu County to solicit investment. After Zhang, the director of the bureau, contacted the Xi-Cheng, Jiangnan, and Xi-Hu long-distance bus companies, the companies all said that they were unable to invest, so there was no result. Recently, the Construction Department issued another order to the county government, ordering the Construction Bureau to urge the progress. After receiving the order, Director Zhang believed that the construction of the roadbed and the acquisition of civilian fields should be carried out after all the funds have been raised, and it is necessary to ask the province for instructions. Therefore, he submitted a report to the county government yesterday and forwarded it to the Construction Department for instructions to follow.</p>

<p>The Provincial Government previously issued an order that all business regiments in the counties should be abolished by the first day of last month. The business regiments in Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Chongming, Huaiyin, Shanghai, and other places were reorganized into militia reserve teams or sentry posts according to the county's militia training methods, and were controlled by the county magistrates and commanded by the local district chiefs and township chiefs. After receiving the order, most of the business regiments in the counties advocated that the principle of not deviating from the word "business" should be followed, so it has not been implemented yet. It is necessary to wait until after the winter defense before reorganizing. The Provincial Security Department issued another order to the county government yesterday, ordering the cancellation of the name of the business regiment as soon as possible, and reorganizing it according to the regulations as soon as possible. There shall be no other changes in name to obscure the provincial order.</p>

<p>The county stipulates that the slaughter tax of fresh meat in Jiaxing will be increased by 65% of the regular tax. Each pig must pay a surcharge of two jiao and six fen. The meat merchants expressed their disagreement because they could not afford it. The county magistrate ordered the Public Security Bureau to summon and detain eleven meat merchants. Although the county chamber of commerce requested bail, it was rejected. Now it is learned that the case has been resolved after several consultations. The county government has approved the exemption of the seventh and eighth months, and the donation amount is still planned to be 65%, which must not be reduced. The meat merchants have agreed to pay, so the meat merchants who were in custody have also been released.</p>

<p>Chen Shunxiang, a telephone operator at the Shanghai An Yu Securities Exchange, is from Shangyu and is 19 years old. On the 2nd of this month, he stole a check for 2,300 yuan from the exchange, cashed 600 yuan into the Bank of Communications, 700 yuan into the Zhongnan Bank, and 700 yuan into the Savings Bank, and fled to Hangzhou with the remaining money. He stayed at a hotel in the city station. That night, the Public Security Bureau checked the room and found him suspicious. After searching, they found deposit slips and cash, and sent them to the court. Chen confessed, and it was ordered to be sent for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Public Security Bureau learned the other day that a certain party in Shanghai was secretly buying silver in Yong, and the smuggling agency was located at No. 102 Shizi Street. After receiving the report, Director Yu secretly sent staff members to disguise themselves as civilians and secretly observe the movements in the vicinity. On the morning of the 6th, they saw Ding Axiang, a waiter on the Ning Shao Wheel, carrying a package outside the house at that number. Seeing that the shape was quite heavy, the police jumped out and detained him. After inspecting the package, it was shockingly 500 yuan. When they searched the room, no silver was found. Only Qiu, the wife of Li Axing, lived there. Li Axing, the owner of the house, had already fled after hearing the news. The police then sent the captured criminals Ding Axiang and Qiu, together with the silver, to the headquarters for handling.</p>

<p>The Second District Jiangzhen Tax Police Special Service Team seized a large ship of smuggled salt, about 300 dan, at Waishan Zao half a month ago. Then, the team leader Li Liangwen privately sold more than 100 dan, and only sent the remaining amount to the Shanghai Second District Department. Then, he loaded hundreds of dan of smuggled salt and transported it to Chuansha, and started the shore on Heqing Beach. He was detected by Han Jingzhou, the deputy captain of the Zhuqiao Commercial Patrol Team, and sent the team scout Ma Huangjin to detain him, and found a tax police special service team flag with the words Jiangzhen on board. After being led by the team leader Xue Juqing, he prepared a document to send the ship and salt to the Shanghai Second District Department for handling. However, Xue had a joint smuggling relationship with Li, so he did not send the team flag together. The Second District Department was secretly reported and forwarded to the Nanxiang Tax Police Bureau. Deputy Director Zhang Qingcheng arrived in Nanmi.</p>

On the evening of the 3rd, they received a threatening letter from Lin Yixi, claiming to be the leader of the San Ai Party, claiming to borrow 50 yuan, otherwise, he would use a pistol against a gun, etc. Fei's surname initially ignored it. But he received a reminder letter, instructing him to put the money in the envelope of the letter and hide it under the incense burner of Dingren Temple next door, and light incense candles as a signal. Fei Zhang's family put five yuan of silver, covered with the Fei stamp of Shuzhitang, and set it up as instructed. Another servant, Sun A'nan, was sent to reconnoiter in the vicinity. Sure enough, a young man was seen entering the hall this afternoon, taking out the envelope and hiding it in his pocket, and left happily. He was captured by the servant and sent to the Public Security First Sub-Station for questioning. However, Su Xingqing, who was a carpenter, came out to stop him, and the neighbors recognized that Su was suspected and sent him to the bureau together. After interrogation, the young man's name was Wang Yongchang, 18 years old, from Sijing, and he was apprenticing at Su's place. Because it was cold and he had no money to buy clothes, he conspired with Xu to write a letter of intimidation. Then Wang Yongchang was escorted to the county government to arrest Xu, who confessed his name as Xu Zengchang, 16 years old, from Zhangze. Wang Yongchang was actually Su Xingqing's son, and Su began to bow his head and said nothing, only saying that his son was unfilial and did not know his actions.</p>

<p>— Ding Wenjiang, Director-General of the Academia Sinica</p>
<p>(Speech to middle school students nationwide on November 26th)</p>
<p>All of these kinds of examples are too numerous to list. The above are merely a few examples casually mentioned regarding the problems the Academia Sinica has already begun to tackle.</p>
<p>Besides the two types of tasks mentioned above, the Academia Sinica also has many other jobs. Some of these tasks have no direct economic value, such as so-called pure physics and chemistry. Other tasks have absolutely no economic value, such as history, language, anthropology, and archaeology.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about so-called pure science problems. Should the nation spend a lot of money to promote research that has no direct economic value? People in various countries around the world have raised this question in the past and present. But in fact, every nation with advanced applied sciences also vigorously promotes pure science. In the United States, much pure science research is funded by industry because pure and applied science are fundamentally inseparable. There are countless examples of scientific applications that originated from so-called pure research. The entire field of engineering comes from physics and chemistry. Wireless radio and X-rays are obvious examples. In terms of geology, nothing is more useless and pure than paleontology. Recently, in the United States, the search for oil mines has required the use of paleontology to calculate the upper and lower depths of oil layers. Paleontology has transformed into a required subject for petroleum geologists. Mr. Weng Wenhao put it well: science is a whole, and there is no such thing as pure or applied. Instead of applied science, it is better to say the application of science.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about history, language, archaeology, anthropology, and so-called social sciences. Some of these are the newest sciences, such as archaeology and anthropology. Others are the oldest disciplines, which have only recently become scientific, such as history and language. Now that they have become scientific, their nature is fundamentally no different from that of the so-called natural sciences. Everything discussed above about pure science can be applied here. Moreover, in China today, people who study these disciplines have an even greater mission. The biggest reason for China's difficulty in achieving unity is that we lack a common belief. The foundation of this belief must be built on our understanding of ourselves. History and archaeology study our nation's past, while archaeology, anthropology, and other social sciences study our nation's present. Only by clearly understanding our nation's past and present can we understand ourselves. The most obvious example is history and archaeology. Many conservatives still believe in a "Golden Age" in ancient times, so they advocate maintaining old rituals, studying the classics, and restoring the past. In recent years, the Academia Sinica has excavated the old capital and tombs of the Shang Dynasty in Anyang County, Henan Province. We have obtained much material that allows us to understand the living conditions of people at that time. Their strange and cruel superstitions, their simple and naive lives, can greatly help us break the concept of a "Golden Age." For example, when an emperor died, in addition to the chariots, horses, and utensils buried with him, hundreds of people were beheaded and buried on all sides. Most of the palaces were made of rammed earth because bricks and tiles had not yet been invented. The emperor's sacrifices, hunts, and wars all depended on divination. They would dig a hole in a tortoise shell, burn it, and then look at the cracks on it to determine the auspiciousness or misfortune of the divination. If those who advocate restoring the past are correct, to what extent should we restore it? If we restore the cultural level of the Shang Dynasty, how can we live? The contributions of archaeology and history are like this, and so are the contributions of other fields. Understanding that there are no major differences between the various ethnic groups in the Far East can be proven by measurement. Understanding that various dialects are simply variations of one language. Understanding that the Republic of China is a single economic unit, unable to survive after division. Only then can the foundation of unity be built on national consciousness.</p>
<p>The above describes the Academia Sinica's method of implementing science. The task of guiding, coordinating, and encouraging academic research is led by the Academia Sinica's Council. The Council has a total of forty-one members. The president of the Academia Sinica and the ten directors of the institutes are ex officio members. The remaining thirty members are elected by the presidents of various national universities and then appointed by the National Government. The first Council was established in a few months of this year. Important domestic research institutions such as the Peking Research Institute, the Geological Survey of China, the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Biological Laboratory of the Science Society of China, the Jing Sheng Biological Institute of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, the Huanghai Industrial Chemistry Research Society, and universities such as Peking, Tsinghua, Wuhan, Central, Sun Yat-sen, Zhejiang, Nankai, Union, and Yenching all have representatives elected. Therefore, the Academia Sinica's Council is an organization that represents academic research nationwide. When meetings are held, they are divided into groups according to the subjects already established by the Academia Sinica. Then, the committees of each group investigate the achievements of research institutions nationwide and the works published by scholars nationwide, to serve as a basis for future coordination and cooperation.</p>
<p>In fact, even before the establishment of the Council, domestic research institutions already had considerable coordination and cooperation. For example, in geology, there is the Geological Survey of China under the Ministry of Industry, the Geological Institute of the Academia Sinica, the Guangdong-Guangxi Geological Survey, the Henan Geological Survey, and the Hunan Geological Survey. In recent years, the work of these five institutions has been rationally allocated, without any duplication, and the institutions have helped each other, without regard to boundaries. For example, last year, when the Guangdong-Guangxi Geological Survey investigated the geology of Guangxi, it did not have enough staff, so the Academia Sinica sent two people to join. The Academia Sinica sent a researcher to Yunnan to investigate minerals, and the Geological Survey sent an investigator to assist him. The Hunan Geological Survey had insufficient funding, so the Central Geological Survey subsidized it with 8,000 yuan each year and sent people to help them work in Hunan. For example, in biology, the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica, the Biological Laboratory of the Science Society of China, the Jing Sheng Biological Survey in Peking, and the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Peking Research Institute have all discussed and agreed on a division of labor and cooperation. The institutions in Peking are responsible for the biological survey of northern China. The Science Society is responsible for the classification of organisms in the Yangtze River basin, while the Academia Sinica focuses on marine biology along the coast. Countries along the Pacific Ocean have a Pacific Science Association. Within the association, there is a committee for studying oceanography. Each member country has a branch. In April of this year, the Chinese branch was initiated and established by the Academia Sinica. It is divided into five groups: 1. Fisheries technology. 2. Fisheries. 3. Coral reefs. 4. Physical oceanography. 5. Marine biology. In addition to the Academia Sinica, the institutions represented by each group include the Peking Research Institute, the Science Society of China, the Jing Sheng Biological Survey, the Ministry of Industry, the Hydrographic Office of the Navy, and universities in Shandong, Xiamen, and Sun Yat-sen, the Qingdao Observatory, the Chinese Zoological Society, and aquatic product experiment stations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. At that time, it was decided to establish marine biology research laboratories in Xiamen, Dinghai, Yantai, and Qingdao, which would be separately managed by Xiamen University, the Academia Sinica, the Peking Research Institute, Shandong University, and the Qingdao Observatory. At the same time, the Hydrographic Office of the Navy, with subsidies from the Resources Committee, the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the Academia Sinica, advanced the measurement of detailed charts of the waterway from the Yangtze River estuary to Haizhou. The Third Fleet also lent the Dinghai warship to the Academia Sinica to conduct research on marine biology in the Shandong Peninsula and the Bohai Bay. The staff of the Academia Sinica often teach courses at various universities, but although they hold concurrent positions, they do not receive concurrent salaries. This is because all employees of the Academia Sinica are strictly restricted from receiving any salary or public funds outside the institute in any name.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other projects in which the Academia Sinica cooperates with various parties, and I do not have time to explain them in detail. The few examples mentioned above can already prove that there is not much conflict or duplication among domestic research institutions. And their spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation can serve as a model for other organizations.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more issue worth discussing. When I broadcasted last time, I said that the amount of money spent on scientific research annually in China, both public and private, is approximately four million yuan. To understand the meaning of this number, we can compare it with other countries. According to estimates by the National Research Council of the United States, the cost of industrial research in the United States is approximately 750,000 gold dollars per day. Therefore, the entire nation's annual expenditure on scientific research is less than the amount spent on industrial research in the United States in two days. The numbers mentioned above do not include the various museums, universities, and government institutions in the United States, such as the Central Geological Survey. The Central Geological Survey alone has an annual budget of more than three million gold dollars. Adding all items together, the United States spends at least 300 million gold dollars on scientific research each year. According to the current exchange rate, this is approximately 900 million national currency. Therefore, our expenditure on scientific research is less than two-hundredths of that of the United States. According to Huxley's estimate, the cost of scientific research in the United Kingdom is approximately one-quarter of that of the United States, which is fifty times more than ours. Our population is four times larger than that of the United States and eight times larger than that of the United Kingdom. Our industry and academics are decades behind those of the United States and the United Kingdom. From this, we can see that the expenditure we currently spend on scientific research is truly just a drop in the bucket compared to our needs. (The End)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Zhu Yaoyuan, Director of the Zhejiang Highway Bureau, was buried this morning. More than 700 people from various institutions and friends helped with the funeral. The family accompanied the coffin back to Haiyan, his hometown, for burial at a later date. Staff at all stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway wore black gauze to express their condolences. (8th Dispatch) Correction: The Tianjin telegram reported a few days ago that He Xiaoyi, Magistrate of Zunhua County, went to Tong County, and county administration was temporarily handled by Secretary Liu Fuhe. Now, according to a letter from Mr. He, his resignation from the post of Zunhua County Magistrate was approved long ago, and he was transferred to the post of Jianshan County Magistrate by the provincial government on July 22. Zhao Congqun was appointed to succeed him in the vacancy of Zunhua. It is feared that the rumors from afar are inaccurate, so a special correction is made.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Flooding in Hanchuan Has Not Receded <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>More Than 700,000 Mu of Fertile Land Still Submerged in Water. Cao River and Gao Xiang River, One Zhang Deep, Urgently Need Dredging</p>
<p>Correspondent's Dispatch. This year's flood disaster in Hubei Province was most severe in the Xiang River basin, including Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan counties. The land flooded has not receded from summer until winter, and the suffering of the disaster victims has likely exceeded historical records. Meng Guangpeng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, departed from Wuchang on the Ren'ai gunboat on the 4th to inspect Hanchuan. On the 5th, he returned to the province on the same ship. According to Meng's statement, "I departed on the 4th, taking the Chude patrol boat and the No. 5 millstone machine patrol with me in addition to the Ren'ai gunboat I was on, for use in the disaster area. We arrived in Hanchuan at 3 PM that day and climbed Mount Fulong, overlooking Lake Tiaowen, which was still a vast expanse of water. Many villages were surrounded, especially in Yongzhong, which was unexpected. At 8 AM on the 5th, we departed from Hanchuan, went to Caojia River by land, and inspected the Yiwenti embankment, the overflow of the Gang Hunan and Beiyuan. Although the flood had receded along the way, the ups and downs were muddy and knee-deep, making it inconvenient to walk. The scene after the disaster was vivid in my mind. There were about dozens of breaches in the Caojia River embankment. We then took a boat to Caidian and returned to the province. The flood disaster in Hanchuan this year was severe. According to old farmers, it was unprecedented in the past 70-80 years, exceeding the previous highest water level by about five feet or more. According to the cleaned acreage, the area still submerged is over 700,000 mu. Districts 4, 5, and 6, all along Lake Tiaohan, have land still submerged. The reasons are that the breach at Jiukou has not been blocked, the water of the Xiang River is still flowing down, and the Cao River downstream of Lake Tiaowen is silted up, impeding drainage. The water level of the lake is more than one zhang higher than that of the Xiang River, causing a blockage with no way out. The submerged land has no prospect of being cultivated. A survey of the dikes and embankments in Hanchuan County shows that there are over 300 of them, large and small. Over 200 embankments were affected this year. Penggong Dike and Nanping Embankment protected more land, but they were also submerged this year. The disaster relief funds for the county, issued by the provincial Disaster Relief Headquarters and raised by the county itself, currently total more than 38,000 yuan, excluding those used for emergency relief. It is proposed to use 19,000 yuan to dredge the Caojia River to address the most urgent need. However, the project is quite large, and the relief funds are too small. It is impossible without the obligatory labor of the local people. The 19,000 yuan relief funds can only provide meals. Regarding the lives of the people in the disaster area, regardless of the past, the future relief measures are that each household in districts 4, 5, and 6 along Lake Tiaowen has a boat and can fish to make a living. The remaining strong men can be divided into a group to work at Jiukou, and those who cannot go far can be assigned to participate in work relief locally. On the land where the water has receded, broad beans and barley have been replanted. In the spring, we can consider adjusting the amount based on the surplus or deficiency, and perhaps we can get through it safely. Secondly, the land survey is progressing smoothly, but about one-fourth of the land has not been measured because it is occupied by water, which hinders registration. In the past, the land in the county was registered by the people themselves, totaling only over 530,000 mu. Now, with the implementation of the cleaned acreage, over 1,300,000 mu have been measured, and it is estimated that over 500,000 mu have not been measured. The people's burden in the past was extremely unfair, so they welcome the cleaned acreage very much. In the future, if the organization is completed, not only can the provincial tax revenue be increased, but also various undertakings in the county can be gradually carried out. Regarding the prohibition of opium, the government is determined. Opium addicts must be registered, and opium dens are absolutely prohibited. An investigation revealed that no opium dens have been found in Hanchuan. The registration of opium addicts is in progress. Caidian is an area where people from five directions gather. A few private opium dens were found. The Public Security Bureau has been ordered to arrest the criminals and send them to the county for punishment. The head of the local Public Security Bureau will also be punished for failing to enforce the prohibition.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Communist Bandits in Jiaodong Are About to Be Eliminated <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Zhan Shutang Suppresses Bandits in the Border Area of Haiyang and Muping Counties; Bandits Have Collapsed; Cleanup Underway</p>
<p>Correspondent's Dispatch from Weixian. Since the troubles in North China, and Yin Rugeng's rebellion, Hebei Province has been shrouded in a cloud of gloom. This province borders Hebei, so the local security is of utmost importance. Last month, bandits of the so-called "Autonomous Army" were discovered in the Daming area, attempting to riot. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, immediately ordered Rong Guangxing, commander of the 87th Brigade stationed in Liaocheng, to quickly resolve the situation, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries, to nip the rebellion in the bud. Fortunately, it was suppressed. Recently, there has been a red terror on the Jiaodong Peninsula. It is reported that more than 2,000 party members are entrenched in the border area of Muping and Haiyang counties. Upon receiving the report, Han Fuqu immediately sent Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division, to suppress them. The following is a record of the news:</p>
<p>Origin of the Bandits: The bandit leader is Duan Chengzhai. He is said to be a student from a certain school, originally from Duanjia Village in the southern part of Muping County. Although he had contact with bandits on a regular basis, he was not powerful enough to take action. Recently, taking advantage of the unrest in Hebei, he decided to make an attempt. He launched an uprising on the 25th of last month with only a few dozen people. Only half of them had guns. The rest had homemade guns, spears, and broadswords. Their plan was to seize the guns of the local defense force stationed in Tonghai Village, as there were only a few of them, to strengthen their forces. At noon that day, they broke into Tonghai Village. Because the defense force was small in number and had received a warning beforehand, they avoided confrontation and fled elsewhere. The bandits were disappointed, so they set fire to the defense force's station and looted those in the village who had some wealth, inciting poor people to join them. They then went to nearby Pingji Town and other places to loot. In this operation, the Tonghai Village defense force did not lose any guns, and the fire in the houses was also extinguished, only destroying two or three rooms. Tonghai Village is a bus stop, and the station staff were also taken away, only to escape the next day. From then on, the bandit force gradually grew, reaching 1,000 to 2,000 people, entrenched in the southwestern part of Muping County, with reddish-brown flags and propaganda materials.</p>
<p>Raiding Haiyang: At the beginning of this month, several hundred bandits raided Haiyang from Muping, inciting the people along the way to join them by force, and cutting off part of the long-distance telephone line. Haiyang County had already heard the news. The Joint Village Association of the Third District came out to intercept them, and the local militia also intercepted them at Guoge Village. The bandits were a motley crowd and were quickly repulsed. The militia captured a pistol and a rifle, as well as two bandits. According to the bandits, they were communists and were ordered by their leader to launch an uprising at a fixed time. It was reported that thousands of party members had joined forces.</p>
<p>Martial Law in Yantai: Yantai is very close to Muping County. For the sake of prevention, the Public Security Bureau of the county issued a notice to all entertainment venues to stop business at 11 PM every night. The street chiefs of the Qishan area received a notice from the second branch bureau under their jurisdiction to close the city gates at 10 PM every night and open them at 5 AM the next morning, and not to open them at any time. The street chiefs have informed the residents to comply. The east, west, and north gates are all set to close at 10 PM, leaving only the south gate open for passage.</p>
<p>Han Orders a Fierce Suppression: After the bandits launched their uprising, Li Shusen, Magistrate of Fushan County, was the first to report it to the provincial government. The other counties also reported it to Jinan one after another. Upon receiving the report, Chairman Han immediately dispatched Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division in Weixian, as the Clearing Commander for Laiyang, Haiyang, Muping, Wendeng, and Rongcheng counties, leading his direct troops and two infantry regiments to carry out the cleaning in the counties and issued the regulations, in order to be able to comply. The expenses required for reconnaissance during the cleaning period were all issued by headquarters, with each regiment receiving 200 yuan, each brigade receiving 200 yuan, and each division receiving 400 yuan. He also ordered that goods be purchased at a price and that no civilian vehicles or horses be requisitioned locally. The daily price was four jiao for each person and horse.</p>
<p>Clearing Conference: After receiving the order, Zhan Shutang led his troops to Laiyang on the 30th and convened a cleaning conference. Those present were Zhan Shutang, Brigade Commander Yong Bangzhi, Regimental Commander Zhao Tingbi, Laiyang County Magistrate Liang Bingkun, Haiyang County Magistrate Luo Mingyu, Muping County Magistrate Wang Zhaoxu, Wendeng County Magistrate Liu Chongwu, and Rongcheng County Magistrate Qiu Zhongdu. It was decided that the militia of each county would cooperate with the troops to block the bandits and actively carry out the cleaning.</p>
<p>Two-Sided Attack: According to news from Yantai, Yun Qichang, the brigade commander of Zhan's division stationed in Laiyang County, was ordered to lead part of the force in 28 vehicles to Yantai for a short rest, and then went to Muping. The troops stationed in Muping also traveled to the mountainous areas of Weixian, Rongcheng, and Duan in more than 20 vehicles, pursuing south from Muping. At the same time, a regiment of troops was dispatched from Laiyang to Haiyang. Zhan Shutang himself also went to Haiyang from Laiyang. In a two-pronged attack, according to what was heard on the 4th, the bandits had been resolved, with more than a dozen bandits killed and more than 300 captured. The cleaning is still ongoing.</p>

<p>The First Army Handles Winter Defense and Bandit Suppression, Xun'an Highway Being Built Urgently, Preparations Begin for Guangzhou-Ganzhou Civil Aviation</p>
<p>Correspondent's Dispatch from Guangzhou. Last month, the Directly Subordinate Guard Regiment and Chen Shuying's 5th Regiment of the 2nd Division of the First Army were transferred from Ganzhou to Jiangkou, on the border of Ganxian, Yudu, and Xingguo counties, to be stationed. Chen's Regiment arrived at Jiangkou on the 29th of last month to take up their position, responsible for searching and suppressing the remaining bandits and pacifying the area along the east bank of the Gan River. At the same time, the Second Division also sent the 4th and 6th Regiments and the Training Regiment to advance into the Ganzhou, Dabu, and Wangmudu areas to liaise with the Jiangkou garrison to carry out winter defense. The defense area left behind in Xinfeng is temporarily taken care of by Zhang Ruigui's 3rd Division stationed in Anyuan. As for part of the First Division, led by Peng Linsheng, Deputy Division Commander of the First Division, they have gone to the Hunan border to cooperate with the Hunan Army in suppressing the remaining bandits of Li Zongbao's department. Yesterday, Deputy Division Commander Peng Linsheng reported in a telegram from Enshun that the First Division had been searching and suppressing bandits in Guidong, Rucheng, and other counties on the Hunan border for several days, capturing more than 20 people, seizing more than 100 guns, and rescuing more than a dozen men and women taken as hostages. The remaining bandits are now hiding in Zixing, and they are being tracked down. Another group of remaining bandits, led by Yang Musen, after being blocked by the 13th Brigade and the 11th and 12th Companies of the Jiangxi Border Security Team, have fled into Zihe. The Jiangxi Security Team has also returned to Suichuan. It is now heard that Yang has recently surrendered to Deputy Division Commander Peng, and Peng has telegraphed the military headquarters for instructions. In addition to separately searching and suppressing the remaining bandits, the two divisions of the First Army have also been paying attention to the construction of the Jiangxi-Southern Highway. The roads in Xinfeng have been completed in sequence, and the construction of the Anxun Highway is now being rushed. This route runs from Anyuan to Xunwu, is 180 li long, and the military headquarters has ordered the two counties of Xunwu and Anyuan to recruit laborers in sections to build the roadbed. Recently, the head of the Xinfeng Engineering Team was sent to Anyuan with his team to speed up the work, aiming to complete the construction by the end of this year to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>The Southwest Civil Aviation Company believes that Jiangxi-South and Guangdong have close relations. Although highways have been opened for transportation, the distance between Ganzhou and Guangzhou is long, and the round trip takes time. In order to facilitate communication and speed up the movement of goods, it is planned to open a Ganzhou-Guangzhou civil aviation route in the near future. This route originally had Guangzhou and Nanchang as its main stations, with Shaoguan, Dayu, Ganxian, and Ji'an as branch stations. However, because the establishment of a station in Nanchang is still pending negotiation with the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Ganzhou will be temporarily used as the terminus until an agreement is reached, with branch stations in Shaoguan and Dayu. A pilot and a radio operator have been sent along the route to survey and find a suitable airfield, and two Stinson aircraft have been ordered from a foreign company for use on this route. In the future, if it develops, it will be expanded. (December 3rd)</p>

<p>The residence of Fei Zhang's family at No. 2272 Zhongshan Road East in this city is slightly wealthy. On the evening of the 3rd, they received a threatening letter signed by Lin Yixi, the head of the San'ai Party, demanding a loan of 50 yuan, or else they would use a gun. The Fei family initially ignored it, but then received a reminder letter, instructing them to put the money in the envelope of the letter, hide it secretly under the incense burner of the adjacent Dingren Palace, and light incense as a signal. Fei Zhang's family prepared five silver yuan, stamped with the mark of Shuzitang Fei, and proceeded as instructed. They also sent their servant Sun Aying to scout nearby. Sure enough, this afternoon, they saw a young man enter, take out the envelope, and hide it in his pocket, cheerfully setting off. The servant immediately caught him and took him to the First Police Substation for questioning. Unexpectedly, Su Xingqing, who worked as a carpenter, came out to stop them. Neighbors believed that Su was suspected and took him to the bureau as well. The young man confessed that his name was Wang Yongchang, 18 years old, from Sijing. He was an apprentice at Su's workshop and, because it was cold and he had no money to buy clothes, conspired with Xu to write a threatening letter. Wang Yongchang was then escorted to the county government to arrest Xu, who confessed his name as Xu Zengchang, 16 years old, from Zhangze. It turned out that Wang Yongchang was Su Xingqing's son, and Su finally bowed his head without a word, only claiming that his son was unfilial and that he did not know about his actions.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Nanhui: Squad Leader Sells Confiscated Contraband Salt, Case Cracked <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangzhen Special Task Force of the Second District Tax Police, half a month ago, seized a large boat of contraband salt, approximately over 300 dan, at Waizao. Thereupon, the squad leader Li Jingwen privately sold over 100 dan. Only the remaining amount was sent to the Second District headquarters in Shanghai. Subsequently, several hundred dan of contraband salt was loaded and transported to Chuansha. Upon landing at Heqing Beach, it was detected by the deputy squad leader Han Jingzhou of the Zhuqiao Commercial Patrol. He dispatched Ma Huangjin of the patrol to detain the shipment. A flag of the Special Task Force with the words "Jiangzhen" on it was found on the boat. The team was led by Squad Leader Xue Juqing, who prepared a document and sent the boat and salt to the Second District headquarters in Shanghai for investigation. However, Xue and Li had a joint relationship in the smuggling operation. Therefore, he did not submit the task force flag along with the shipment. This was secretly reported to the Second District headquarters, which then forwarded the information to the Nanxiang Tax Police Bureau. Deputy Director Zhang Qingcheng arrived in Nanhui and secretly investigated, finding a matching task force flag within the Jiangzhen Special Task Force. It matched the flag that Xue Juqing had been secretly reported to have intercepted. Deputy Director Zhang believed that the flag had not been issued by superiors but was clearly privately made by the task force. He immediately took the flag to the bureau and instructed the district headquarters to detain Xue the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, Li Jingwen abandoned his post and fled. He is currently being pursued.</p>

<p>The Chengjin Coal Mine in Xishan, Dongting, uses indigenous methods for coal extraction, yielding over twenty tons daily. However, due to mismanagement, disputes frequently arise. The Xishan Association in Shanghai, due to the repeated disturbances caused by the mine workers to the local residents, has petitioned the ministry to request its ban. All the merchants in the Xishan area have also collectively submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government on the eighth, demanding that the mining be stopped, citing that the mine has not been issued a permit by the ministry and is disrupting commercial activities. They have also requested that military police be dispatched to the mountain to forcibly disperse the migrant workers to prevent further disturbances.</p>

<p>Chen Yuchu, the head of the County Public Security Bureau, believes that private prostitution is rampant in Xiyi and cannot be effectively prohibited. He has repeatedly considered establishing educational centers and shelters, but due to budget limitations, many practical difficulties have prevented him from realizing these plans. However, continuing in this manner will severely harm social morality and national health. It has been found that the regulations for banning prostitution in Jiangsu Province have been promulgated for a long time. Since the province has launched trial runs, there have been achievements. Wuxian has also followed suit and has had initial results. The prostitution situation in Xiyi is no different from that in Wuxian. Implementing the regulations is the only fundamental solution. This matter was brought up for discussion during the 61st police affairs meeting. The decisions made were: (1) To draft various regulations based on the Wuxian model and submit them for approval. (2) To temporarily designate Beicheng Jiao and Youshan as first-class prostitution districts, Wanxiang as a second-class prostitution district, and Dong as a third-class prostitution district, to be surveyed and designated by the department in conjunction with the relevant branch bureau.</p>

<p>The County Construction Bureau has been ordered to build the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway and has already begun to handle the matter in conjunction with the Wuxian Construction Bureau. The route plan charts have also been approved by the province. Concurrently, the bureau has contacted merchants to solicit investment. After contacting the Zhangjian Bureau Cheng, Jiangnan, and Xihu long-distance bus companies, the companies cited their inability to invest, and no results were achieved. Recently, the Construction Department again instructed the county government to direct the Construction Bureau to expedite the project. After receiving the order, Director Zhang decided that whether the construction of the roadbed and the acquisition of farmland should commence after all the funds have been raised requires instructions from the provincial authorities. Therefore, he specially submitted a report to the county government yesterday to be forwarded to the Construction Department for instructions.</p>

<p>The merchant corps in various counties were previously ordered by the provincial government to be abolished uniformly by the first day of last month. The merchant corps in Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Chongming, Huaiyin, Shanghai, and other places were to be converted into reserve militia or watch posts in accordance with the methods for training strong young men in the respective counties, under the control of the county magistrates and under the command of the district and township chiefs. After receiving the order, most of the county merchant corps advocated adhering to the "merchant" principle, and therefore, the reorganization has not yet been implemented. It must wait until after the winter defense before being reorganized. The Provincial Security Department specially ordered the county government yesterday to abolish the name of the merchant corps as soon as possible, to reorganize it according to regulations without any other nominal changes, and not to obscure the provincial order.</p>

<p>The Jiaxing fresh meat industry's slaughter tax, as stipulated by the county, was increased by 65% of the regular tax. Each pig had to pay an additional tax of 2 jiao 6 fen. The meat merchants protested, saying that they could not afford it. The county magistrate ordered the Public Security Bureau to detain eleven meat merchants. Although the county Chamber of Commerce petitioned for bail, it was rejected. It is now known that the case has been resolved after several rounds of negotiations. The county government has approved the exemption of the tax for July and August, while the amount for September, October, and November must be paid. The meat merchants have agreed to pay. Therefore, the meat merchants in custody have been released.</p>

<p>Since the active construction of the Nanyu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the track-laying project has been carried out in four sections. It is expected that the entire section can be connected around the 15th of this month. More than ten bridges along the route have been completed one after another. Only the Liangjiadu and Guixi bridges will be completed in about 20 days. The opening ceremony will be held in Nanchang. Preparations have begun, and the date is scheduled for the 5th of next month. The insufficient funds for the construction cost approximately 2 million yuan. Zeng Yangfu continued to negotiate with Shanghai banks to borrow the funds to meet the needs of the project.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Public Security Bureau recently learned that a certain party in Shanghai was secretly buying silver in Ningbo to smuggle it out of the country. The agency was located at No. 102 Shizi Street. After receiving the report, Director Yu secretly dispatched officers, disguised as civilians, to secretly monitor the area. On the morning of the 6th, they saw Ding Axiang, a waiter at the Ning Shao ship, carrying a package out of the house. Noticing that its shape was quite heavy, the police officers jumped out and detained him. Upon inspection, the package contained 500 yuan in silver. They then searched the room but found no more silver. The only resident was Qiu, the wife of Li Axing, the owner of the house. Li Axing had already fled upon hearing the news. The police officers sent the arrested Ding Axiang and Qiu, along with the silver, to the headquarters for investigation.</p>

<p>— Ding Wenjiang, Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica</p>
<p>(Speech to secondary schools nationwide on November 26th)</p>
<p>All such things, there are too many to list. The above is just a random example of a few problems that the Academia Sinica has already started on.</p>
<p>In addition to the two tasks mentioned above, the Academia Sinica has many other jobs, some of which have no direct economic value, such as so-called pure physics and chemistry. Some are completely without economic value, such as historical languages, ethnology and archeology.</p>
<p>Let's talk about pure scientific issues first. Should the state spend a lot of money to promote research that has no direct economic value? In the past and present, people in all countries around the world have raised this question. But in fact, all countries with developed applied sciences are also making great efforts to promote pure science. In the United States, many pure scientific studies are paid for by industry, because there is fundamentally no way to distinguish between pure and applied. Many scientific applications originate from so-called pure research. There are too many examples to list. The entirety of engineering comes from physics and chemistry. Radio and X-rays are very obvious examples. As far as geology is concerned, nothing is more useless and pure than paleontology. Recently, because the United States is looking for oil, it has to use paleontology to calculate the upper and lower depths of the oil layers. Paleontology has been transformed into a required subject for petroleum geology scholars. Mr. Weng Wenhao put it well, science is a whole, there is no such thing as pure or applied. Rather than applied science, it is better to say the application of science.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to talk about history, language, archeology, ethnology and the so-called social sciences. Some of them are the newest sciences, such as archeology and ethnology; some are the oldest knowledge, and have only recently been scientific, such as history and language. Since they have been scientific, their nature is fundamentally no different from the so-called natural sciences. All the words about pure science discussed above can be cited here. And in today's China, people who study this kind of knowledge have a great mission. The biggest reason why China is not easy to unify is that we do not have a common belief. The foundation of this belief must be built on our understanding of ourselves. History and archeology are the study of our nation's past, archeology, ethnology and other social sciences are the study of our nation's present. By understanding our nation's past and present, we can understand ourselves. The most obvious example is history and archeology. Many conservatives still believe that there was a "golden age" in ancient times, so they advocate maintaining the old ethics, studying the scriptures, and restoring the old ways. In recent years, the Academia Sinica has excavated the old capital and tombs of the Shang Dynasty in Anyang County, Henan. We have obtained a lot of materials that allow us to understand the living conditions of people at that time. Their superstitious strangeness and cruelty, and the simplicity and naivety of their lives, can help us break the concept of the "golden age." For example, when an emperor died, not to mention the sacrificed chariots, horses and utensils, hundreds of people's heads had to be cut off and buried on all sides. Most of the palaces were built with boards, because bricks and tiles had not yet been invented. The emperor's sacrifices, hunting, and wars were all dictated by divination. A hole was dug in the tortoise shell, burned with fire, and then the cracks on it were used to determine the good or bad luck of the divination. If those who advocate returning to the past are right, to what extent should we return? If we return to the cultural level of the Shang Dynasty, how can we live? The contribution of archeological history is like this, and so is everything else. Understanding that there is no fundamental difference between the various ethnic groups in the Far East can be proved by measurement; understanding that various dialects are completely a variation of a single language; understanding that the Republic of China is a whole economic unit and cannot survive after division; then the foundation of unification will be built on the national consciousness.</p>
<p>What I have said above is the method used by the Academia Sinica to practice science. As for the task of guiding, contacting and encouraging academic research, it is presided over by the Academia Sinica's council. There are a total of forty-one members of the council. The president of the Academia Sinica and the ten directors are ex-officio members. The remaining thirty members are elected by the presidents of national universities and then appointed by the National Government. The first council was established in a few months this year. All major research institutions in China, such as the Peiping Research Institute, the Geological Survey Institute, the Agricultural Experimental Institute, the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute of the China Education and Culture Foundation, the Huanghai Industrial Chemistry Research Society, and the universities of Peking, Tsinghua, Wuhan, Central, Zhongshan, Zhejiang, Nankai, Union, and Yanjing all have representatives elected. Therefore, the Academia Sinica's council is an organization representing national academic research. When meetings are held, the subjects that the Academia Sinica has already established are divided into groups. Then, each committee will investigate the achievements of national research institutions and the works published by national scholars as the basis for future liaison and cooperation.</p>
<p>In fact, before the establishment of the council, there was already considerable contact and cooperation among domestic research institutions. For example, in geology, there are the Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Industry, the Geological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, the Guangdong-Guangxi Geological Survey Institute, the Henan Geological Survey Institute, and the Hunan Geological Survey Institute. In recent years, the work of these five institutions has been rationally allocated, without the slightest overlap, and each institution helps each other without distinction. For example, last year, when the Guangdong-Guangxi Geological Survey Institute investigated the geology of Guangxi, there were not enough staff to allocate, so the Academia Sinica sent two people to join. The Academia Sinica sent a researcher to Yunnan to investigate mineral resources, and the Geological Survey Institute sent an investigator to be his assistant. The Hunan Geological Survey Institute had insufficient funds, so the Central Geological Survey Institute subsidized him with 8,000 yuan every year and sent people to help them with their work in Hunan. Another example is biology. The Zoological and Botanical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute in Peiping, and the Animal and Plant Research Institute of the Peiping Research Institute have all discussed and agreed on a division of labor and cooperation. The institutions in Peiping are responsible for the biological survey of northern China. The Science Society is responsible for the classification of organisms in the Yangtze River basin, while the Academia Sinica focuses on marine organisms along the coast. There is a Pacific Science Association of countries along the Pacific Ocean. There is a committee for the study of oceanography. Each member country has a branch. In April of this year, the Chinese branch was initiated and established by the Academia Sinica. It is divided into 1. Fishing Technology. 2. Fisheries. 3. Coral Reef. 4. Physical Oceanography. 5. Marine Biology in five groups. In addition to the Academia Sinica, the institutions represented by each group include the Peiping Research Institute, the Chinese Science Society, the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute, the Ministry of Industry, the Naval Department's Hydrographic Survey Bureau, Shandong, Xiamen, Zhongshan Universities, Qingdao Meteorological Observatory, Chinese Zoological Society, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Experimental Field and other groups. At that time, it was decided to establish marine biological research laboratories in Xiamen, Dinghai, Yantai, and Qingdao, which will be managed separately by Xiamen University, the Academia Sinica, the Peiping Research Institute, Shandong University, and the Qingdao Observatory. At the same time, the Naval Department's Hydrographic Survey Bureau used the subsidies from the Resources Committee, the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the Academia Sinica to measure the detailed charts of the waterway from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Haizhou in advance. The Third Fleet also lent the Dinghai warship to the Academia Sinica to study marine organisms in the Shandong Peninsula and the Bohai Bay. The staff of the Academia Sinica often teach at various universities, but although they work part-time, they do not receive additional salary. Because all the staff of the Academia Sinica are strictly restricted and are not allowed to receive any salary or public funds outside the institute under any name.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many undertakings in which the Academia Sinica cooperates with various parties, and I do not have time to explain them in detail. The few examples mentioned above can already prove that there is not much conflict or duplication among domestic research institutions. And their spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation can be a model for other groups.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more issue worth discussing. The last time I broadcast, I said that China spends approximately 4 million yuan a year on scientific research from both public and private sources. To understand the significance of this number, we can compare it with other countries. According to estimates by the U.S. National Research Council, the U.S. spends approximately 750,000 gold yuan per day on industrial research. Therefore, China's annual expenditure on scientific research is not even worth the amount the U.S. spends on industrial research in two days. The numbers mentioned above do not include the various museums, universities, and government agencies in the United States, such as the Central Geological Survey Institute. The Geological Survey Institute alone has an annual budget of 3 million gold yuan. When all items are added together, the United States spends at least 300 million gold yuan on scientific research each year. According to the current exchange rate, this is approximately 900 million national currency. Therefore, our expenditure on scientific research is not even worth 2/100 of the United States. According to Huxley, the British spend about 1/4 of the United States on scientific research, which is 50 times more than us. Our population is four times that of the United States and eight times that of the United Kingdom. All of our industries and academics are 100 years behind the British and Americans. From this, we can see that the funds we are currently spending on scientific research are truly just a drop in the bucket compared to our needs. (End)</p>

<p>Total of Over 33 Million in Chinese and Foreign Banks, Foreign Banks Account for 4,088 Yuan</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that since the Ministry of Finance implemented the currency management system, the total amount of silver reserves in Shanghai has not been officially announced by the authorities. (According to usual practice, the Central Bank releases figures once every Saturday and Sunday.) The fluctuations in the quantity of silver reserves have been difficult to accurately track. Now, the Central Bank officially announced yesterday the total amount of silver reserves in Chinese and foreign banks in the city. This is the first official statistic released by the government since the implementation of the currency management system. It is reported that the total amount of silver reserves in Shanghai, as of October 31, totaled 33,029,700 yuan. These statistics were released by the Central Bank in its November monthly report issued yesterday. In order to clarify the true meaning of the new currency to all sectors, the bank also published a "Special Issue on the New Currency Law," which is also included in the monthly report. It contains ten articles, including "On the Government's Recently Announced New Currency Law," "The Success and Prospects of the New Monetary System," "The Broad Meaning of China's New Currency Policy," "The Impact of the New Currency Policy on China's Industry and Commerce," "The New Currency Policy and Foreign Exchange," "Some Issues to Note After the Reform of China's Monetary System," "The World Currency War and China's New Monetary System Policy," "The Theoretical Basis for China's Cessation of Silver Coin Circulation," "The Process of China's Monetary Reform," and "Reference Documents on the Monetary System Law of the Republic of China Year 24," providing thorough theoretical details. The total silver reserves of Chinese and foreign banks at the end of October are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Borrowing the Red One-Yuan Notes of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Overprinting the Bank Name, Adding the "Central" Character in Four Corners, and Signing</p>
<p>The Central Bank, due to the insufficient supply of one-yuan legal tender, has borrowed the red one-yuan notes of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, overprinting the bank name, adding the character "央" (Central) in the four corners, and adding the bank's seal and signature. The bank is responsible for issuing these notes, which are equivalent to the previously issued one-yuan notes and are legal tender. A special announcement is issued as follows: The Central Bank's one-yuan legal tender is currently insufficient. We are borrowing the red one-yuan notes of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, overprinting our bank name, adding the character "央" in the four corners, and adding our bank's seal and signature. The bank is responsible for issuing these notes, which are equivalent to the one-yuan notes previously issued by our bank and are legal tender. This announcement is hereby made.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Money Dealers Association held its tenth standing committee meeting of the third session at 4 PM the day before yesterday. Five standing committee members attended: He Zhongbi, Xi Jiming, Lu Shuchen, Qiu Yanshan, and Liu Wuqiao, chaired by He Zhongxiao, with Ge Huaiqing as the recorder. The International Problems Research Association sent a letter requesting to join in initiating a farewell for U.S. Consul General Cunningham's return home and requesting the nomination of a representative to participate. It was resolved to nominate He Zhongxiao, Xi Jiming, Lu Shuchen, Zhang Mengzhou, and Zhang Dafu to participate. Regarding the letter received from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the Social Affairs Bureau's order to balance exchange rates, the price of silver subsidiary coins publicly announced by the money market daily is 833.3 yuan per 10,000 jiao of legal tender, and 300 copper coins per 100 yuan of legal tender. This has not changed since receiving a personal instruction from Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi. As for the exchange rates of the cigarette and exchange shops, the association has no way of knowing. It was resolved to reply by letter. The meeting adjourned at around 5 PM.</p>

<p>Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Department of Finance, came to Shanghai last time to request Finance Minister and Central Bank President Kong Xiangxi to postpone the repayment of the previously borrowed 4 million yuan and to borrow an additional 1 million yuan, totaling 12 million yuan. This was to regulate Sichuan's finances and recover the inconvertible exchange certificates issued by various firms in Chongqing. (The so-called exchange certificates were issued due to a shortage of currency and were not redeemable for cash.) After Director Liu returned to Sichuan, he began implementing the recovery plan. As a result, the excessively high Shanghai-Sichuan exchange rates have gradually returned to normal after the Ministry of Finance reorganized Sichuan's local currency and the Sichuan Department of Finance decided to recover the exchange certificates. The exchange rate the day before yesterday was 1,035 Sichuan yuan per 1,000 Shanghai yuan, a significant drop from the previous peak of over 1,700 Sichuan yuan per 1,000 Shanghai yuan. It is expected that after a considerable period of time, this exchange rate will be eliminated and replaced with a limited handling fee, which will be more convenient for Shanghai and Sichuan merchants.</p>

<p>The National News Agency reports that since the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee began providing loans, many formal manufacturers have relied on them for flexible working capital. Now, as the end of the year approaches, the number of requests for loans to the committee on the second floor of the China National Products Bank on Tianjin Road is particularly high. After receiving the loan applications from various applicants, the committee not only guides them in filling out the forms but also sends personnel to investigate their assets, liabilities, inventory, and other general conditions to determine the standard for assessing their loan amounts. The committee has now submitted the various applications to the eighteenth review committee meeting to be held this afternoon for review and approval.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Korean Trade with China <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Export and Import Amounts Consistently Rank First, Main Export Product is Red Smartweed</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that the commercial relationship between Korea and China has always been close. Although its trade with China is subject to occasional ups and downs, its export and import amounts consistently rank first compared to trade with other foreign countries. A reporter from the New News Agency specially investigated and recorded the situation of Korean trade with China in recent years for the reference of those concerned with international trade.</p>
<p>Trade Situation in the Last Decade</p>
<p>In the last decade, the trade situation between Korea and China, up to the Republic of China Year 19, the trade volume was approximately 15 million to 18 million yuan. From Year 20 onwards, it gradually decreased, reaching only 4.7 million yuan in Year 21. However, in Year 22, it began to recover, reaching 10 million yuan in Year 23. Although trade with China has been subject to occasional ups and downs, its export and import amounts consistently rank first compared to trade with other foreign countries. It is expected that the trade volume may recover to its former level within the year.</p>
<p>Port of Entry and Exit, Incheon Ranks First</p>
<p>Due to geographical reasons, Incheon is the center of Korean trade with China. The trade volume of Chinese merchants accounts for 60% of the total trade volume. The next two are Busan and Zhennampo. The following is a list of the trade situation by port with China last year: Incheon exports 1.150 (unit: 1,000 yuan, same below), imports 4.004; Gyeongseong exports none, imports 32; Gunsan exports 10, imports 282; Wonsan exports none, imports 54; Cheongjin exports 22, imports 4; Unggi exports none, imports 6; Busan exports 510, imports 752; Mokpo exports 4, imports 77; Sinuiju exports 123, imports 199; Zhennampo exports 244, imports 2.239; Pyongyang exports 10, imports 14.</p>
<p>Main Export and Import Products</p>
<p>Last year, red smartweed ranked first among Korea's main export products to China, with a value of approximately 800,000 yuan. Next was seafood, approximately 400,000 yuan, apples, approximately 140,000 yuan, and various canned goods, approximately 100,000 yuan. In terms of major import products, ramie fabric ranked first, with a value of approximately 1.7 million yuan. Next was coal, approximately 1.6 million yuan, salt, approximately 1.3 million yuan, chili peppers, approximately 400,000 yuan, raw cotton, approximately 400,000 yuan, spun cotton, approximately 400,000 yuan, and iron ore, approximately 400,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Fundraising Association held its fifth executive board meeting at the Renji Tang Association yesterday afternoon at 4 PM to discuss the preparation of winter relief. Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Lu Bohong, Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Li Dachao, Qu Wenliu, Guan Gangzhi, Mao Yun, Huang Bodu, Wang Tiaoqi, Zhu Xiechen, Jiang Zhongquan, Chen Jicheng, Chen Liangyu, Wang Yansong (represented by Chen Jicheng), Mu Ouchu, Li Zizai, Chen Timin, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Zhao Jinqing, and Zhao Yiwu, totaling over 20 people, attended, chaired by Xu Shiying.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>First, Xu Shiying reported on the number of telegrams received and sent and the amount of relief goods received and distributed. Then, the fundraising group, led by Li Dachao, reported on the fundraising work. Xu Shiying then reported on the following: A. Director Lu Bohong's letter stating that disease is rampant in Shandong Province after the disaster, requesting 5,000 yuan from the health group's medical expenses to handle medical care for the disaster victims in Shandong Province. Approval was granted to allocate the funds in advance and submit them to the meeting for ratification. The 5,000 yuan has already been allocated and is awaiting ratification. B. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau replied that the disposal method for the property of the Sanxin Yarn Factory Tongshan Hall has been determined and is not convenient to change abruptly. C. The association previously appointed Mr. Lu Zhiting to investigate the drought situation in northern Anhui Province. Reports have been received one after another, based on on-site investigations of the disaster conditions in Shouxian, Fengtai, Huoqiu, Yingshang, Fuyang, Linquan, Taihe, Mengcheng, Guoyang, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Dingyuan, Hefei, and Luan counties, confirming that the situation is extremely dire and urgently requires relief. The association has already allocated 25,000 yuan from the previous drought relief fundraising to agricultural relief in Anhui. 2,000 yuan has been submitted to Special Commissioner Shi Guozhu to handle urgent construction and labor relief. The remaining 23,000 yuan has been requested from Director Hongsan to jointly select the four counties of Mengcheng, Yingshang, Guoyang, and Taihe for relief. D. The Shanghai Federation of Charity Organizations, Orphanages, Disability Homes, Vagrant Vocational Training Centers, Women and Children's Relief General Association, and Xin Puyu Tang and other charitable organizations have requested the issuance of tax-exempt passports for the remaining relief rice for drought relief. After the fourth standing committee meeting resolved to hand it over to the standing council for processing, Vice President Wang Yiting verified the situation and distributed them separately, obtaining the seals of the various charitable organizations for verification.</p>
<p>Matters Resolved</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: (1) Director Cheng Yiqing's proposals for winter relief, suggesting direct negotiation with the Ministry of Finance to return the previously borrowed funds from salary deductions and to raise new debts after the old debts are cleared.

<p>The Finance and Public Utilities Bureaus of this city, in order to manage ships, have specially stipulated that departure and return registration must be submitted with verification of the customs book. A joint announcement is issued as follows: It has been found that ships registered in this city have previously only reported departure and return matters based on the reports of the shipowners. While many reports are honest, some are inevitably inaccurate, necessitating reform. After joint consultation between the bureaus, it has been decided that from the date of this announcement, all ships registered in this city and possessing nationality certificates issued by the Maritime Administration Bureau must present the customs book for verification when returning to Shanghai after reporting departure. (First, the ship must be presented to the relevant shipping office of this Public Utilities Bureau for verification and registration, and then presented to the relevant ship tax office of this Finance Bureau for verification and payment of taxes.) This is to ensure accuracy. This announcement is jointly issued, and all shipowners are hereby informed.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The National Economic Commission Oversees the Construction of the Seven-Province Interconnected Highway, Most of Which Has Been Completed and Opened to Traffic <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that according to information recently obtained from transportation sources, the progress of the National Economic Commission's overseeing of the construction of the seven-province interconnected highway is as follows: (1) The Beijing-Shanghai Trunk Line, detouring from Beijing via the Beijing-Hangzhou Road, passing through Jurong to reach Zhenjiang and then Jiangyin, and then detouring via the Xicheng Road to reach Wuxi, has been fully completed and opened to traffic. The roadbed and bridges from Wuxi via Changshu and Taicang to Shanghai, or from Changshu to Suzhou, Kunshan, and then to Shanghai, have also been completed. The road surface project has been completed, so the Beijing-Shanghai Trunk Line can be connected in the near future. (2) The Beijing-Fujian Trunk Line, from Beijing via Hangzhou to Wenzhou, has been fully completed and opened to traffic. The section south of Wenzhou is still under construction. (3) The Shanghai-Guangxi Trunk Line, in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, has been fully completed and opened to traffic, except for a few small sections that require detours. In Hunan Province, from Chaling to Hengyang, detours can be made via Anren and Leiyang to reach Hengyang. The section from Hongqiao to Lishanpu on the Guangxi border is under active construction and will be completed soon. Therefore, it will soon be possible to travel directly by car from Shanghai to Guangxi. (4) The Beijing-Guizhou Trunk Line, from Beijing to Qimen in Anhui Province, and from Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province, via Nanchang and Changsha to Baoqing and then to Dongkou, have been completed and opened to traffic. The section from Qimen to Jingdezhen is under construction in sections. The section west of Dongkou is difficult and costly to construct and remains to be undertaken. (5) The Beijing-Sichuan Trunk Line, the section from Pukou to Wujiang, is planned to be completed this year. The section from Wujiang via Hefei to Taihu County is open to traffic. The section from Taihu to Huangmei, Xishui, and Lijiaji in Hubei Province is partially open to traffic. The section from Lijiaji via Hankou to Yichang is open to traffic.

<h3 id="e129">Promote China's Foreign Trade, American Commercial Counselor Arnold Expresses His Views <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Daily News Agency reports that the International Trade Bureau recently published an article by American Commercial Counselor Arnold expressing his views on promoting China's foreign trade. The language is mostly pertinent, and it can serve as a reference for the development of China's trade. The following is a summary of the main points: China's foreign trade has a history of hundreds of years, but its position in the international market is still very small. Special products such as silk and tea are famous in the world, but they have recently declined. The reasons are no more than two points: (1) The custom of despising merchants. Chinese society has always valued scholars and despised merchants. This is because those who seek fame and fortune would rather study classic texts than engage in commerce. Only recently has the government begun to pay attention to the development of the country's commerce. (2) Lack of competitiveness. Products such as Chinese tea, silk, native cloth, and other handicrafts are unique in the world market, but due to a lack of competitiveness, they have gradually been encroached upon by other countries, leading to a decline. Specifically, for example, the United States discovered decades ago that using Chinese tung oil to make paint was far superior to the linseed oil originally used in the United States. They began to use Chinese tung oil, and soon tung oil became a major raw material for paint, with exports increasing sharply every year, becoming a major export commodity for foreign trade. However, because Chinese merchants sometimes took the opportunity to raise prices and adulterate inferior oil, they lost the trust of foreign merchants. Therefore, leaders of the American paint industry advised the American people to plant tung trees themselves and produce tung oil. It was decided to organize the American Tung Oil Co., Ltd. to purchase 1,200 acres of land in Gainesville, Florida, and begin planting tung trees. However, this matter will inevitably increase the consumption of Chinese tung oil when the new uses of tung oil are invented, which is beneficial to the Chinese tung oil industry. As long as Chinese tung oil improves native products and sales methods, the future is still promising. Chinese tea and tung oil are also for the same reason. Regarding fresh fruits and vegetables, methods can be found to promote and expand the domestic market. For example, South China is rich in delicious lychees, but Chinese people rarely pay attention to transporting them to Central and Northern China. Also, Fuzhou mandarin oranges are world-famous products, which can be carefully selected to become standard products and transported to major cities across the country for promotion. Vegetables can be improved in the same way as Japan. For example, soy milk is a special product invented by China, which is rich in nutrients and is very cheap. It can be promoted to become a major industry. In addition, handicrafts, porcelain, etc., can be vigorously developed in domestic and foreign markets. Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, said, "To rectify China's industry and commerce, it must be complemented by improving agriculture." He also said, "To consolidate China's national foundation, there is no other good method than to improve agriculture and promote light industry." Therefore, to improve China's foreign trade, commerce and agriculture must advance together. China is uniquely endowed by nature and is difficult to compete with in other countries around the world. However, due to the lack of economical means of transportation, the high interest rates on national debt, the inability to concentrate and unify taxation, the lack of attention to cost accounting, and the lack of perfect organization in various industries and businesses, there is no hope of prosperity. If efforts can be made to improve in the future, there is unlimited hope.</p>

<p>Will Invite Banking Circles and Yarn Industry Tycoons to Discuss a Comprehensive Relief Plan to Save the Perilous Situation</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that Shanghai's Shenxin First and Fifth Textile Factories previously suffered huge losses due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, which led to a tight money supply and a declaration of closure. More than 10,000 workers at the two factories suddenly faced unemployment, and their livelihoods were in jeopardy. They submitted a petition to the local party and government organs in the city, urging the factories to find ways to resume work as soon as possible, but to no avail. On the 12th of last month, the Fifth National Congress was held in Beijing, and the workers again sent representatives to Beijing to petition for relief. At the conference, Central Committee member Wu Zhihui and others jointly proposed a proposal to relieve the cotton yarn industry, which was resolved to be transferred to the competent authorities for handling. It is now known that after the Ministry of Industry was ordered to investigate the details after the order, it was found that China's yarn industry was subject to foreign yarn dumping and that the supply already exceeded demand. If thorough relief measures are not taken, the future is extremely dangerous. Therefore, it recently sent commercial affairs staff to Shanghai to investigate the details and has already prepared a report and returned to Beijing for reporting. It is now known that Vice Minister Liu Weichi has come to Shanghai the day before yesterday and will invite banking circles and yarn industry tycoons Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, and others to discuss a comprehensive plan and then Liu will take it to Beijing to study and implement relief measures to save the perilous situation.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Ministry of Interior Explains Copyright Issues <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guoyuan News Agency, the Ministry of Interior previously received three questions from the Commercial Press in this city regarding the interpretation of copyright of published books, and the Judicial Yuan has replied with the following interpretations: (1) The real name of the author of a work, as registered by a government agency, legal entity, or organization as the owner of the copyright, is different from a work whose name is purely the name of a government agency. The term of copyright enjoyment should be determined based on whether the author still has any interest in the work after registration. If the author has transferred the entire work to a government agency, legal entity, or organization and no longer enjoys any interest, then the copyright belongs entirely to the legal entity or organization, and the term of enjoyment should be thirty years in accordance with Article 7 of the Copyright Law. If the copyright owner still enjoys copyright benefits after the legal entity or organization registers (such as collecting royalties), then the copyright owner has not relinquished the relationship, and the term of enjoyment should be the period enjoyed by the original author in accordance with Article 4, Item 5 of the same law. (2) Since Article 3 of the Copyright Law stipulates that copyright can be transferred, if the author or their heir transfers the work to another person before obtaining copyright, unless otherwise indicated, it should naturally be regarded that the copyright obtainable on the work has also been transferred. Therefore, the remainder of the works issued after the death of the author stipulated in Article 6 of the Judicial Yuan is not limited to the author's heirs. A collector who prints ancient texts and paintings, if the acquisition of the work comes from the transfer of the author's heirs, may enjoy the copyright for the period stipulated in that article. If the printed matter is an ownerless work, then after it is approved for publication in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 8 of the Implementing Rules of the same law, it may be submitted for registration to enjoy copyright. As for whether the work is an original or a copy, it does not matter. (3) The term "circulating" in Article 1, Item 1 of the Implementing Rules of the Copyright Law only means that the work can actually be recognized as circulating, and it is not limited to printing and dissemination. Whether the collector of rubbings of famous steles can apply for registration according to law should be based on this standard. In addition, the Ministry of Interior believes that Article 8 of the Implementing Rules of the Copyright Law, regarding the regulations on the publication of ownerless works, if copyright protection should be granted after approval for publication and then application for registration, is doubtful, and has sent a letter to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation, stating that a work approved for publication in accordance with Article 8 of the Implementing Rules of the Copyright Law must meet the requirements of Article 1, Item several of the Copyright Law to enjoy copyright protection.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Coal Industry Association Opposes Coal Price Increase; General Meeting Held Yesterday, Declaration Issued <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Coal Industry Association, in view of the fact that since the promulgation of the currency reform by the Ministry of Finance, general speculators have taken the opportunity to raise commodity prices, with Kailuan coal recently increasing in price three times in half a month, increasing by more than two yuan per ton, convened an extraordinary general meeting of members at 3 pm yesterday. Over 400 people, including Bao Zhexing, Chen Yushu, Pan Yisan, Mao Chunpu, Wang Wenzheng, Chen Weibin, and Xu Yiyong, attended. Chen Yushu and others were publicly elected as chairmen to report on the purpose of the meeting, and then the agenda was discussed: (1) Opposing exorbitant price increases, publicly electing representatives to petition and implement sanctions. It was resolved to elect 13 representatives to carry out the petition. (2) Telegramming the government, ordering all coal mines to supply coal and maintain market prices. It was resolved to pass the motion. (3) Issuing a declaration opposing the increase in coal prices. It was resolved to pass the motion. (4) Whether to accept Kailuan Coal's offer to sell 10,000 tons at a low price. It was resolved not to accept. The declaration is recorded as follows: "Since the outbreak of the September 18th and January 28th national crises, the situation has been serious and changes unpredictable. There is nothing that does not shock and frighten those who are concerned, and there is nothing that does not allow speculators to rise in rank and make a fortune. Thinking of this, what good is there in sighing? The only plan is to invigorate ourselves and strengthen our ability to cope, so that all difficulties can be overcome and all confusion can be resolved. On November 4th of this year, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the currency policy. This is a major national plan that cannot be taken lightly. However, speculators misunderstood the principles and thought that a major disaster was imminent, and competed to raise the prices of goods arbitrarily, manipulating and hoarding them by any means possible. The Ministry of Finance had already foreseen this and repeatedly issued clear orders, strictly prohibiting and severely punishing illegal merchants in accordance with the law. The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau have also repeatedly issued instructions to strictly crack down on and arrest illegal merchants who violate the orders and punish them severely in accordance with the law. However, Kailuan Coal Mine has recently increased its price three times in half a month, with each ton of coal increasing by more than two yuan, which not only violates the law but also dares to openly hoard and manipulate prices, which is inappropriate in terms of both reason and law. In order to maintain business and stabilize market prices, the Association has not only reported to the competent authorities to petition for sanctions, but also seeks effective countermeasures based on the self-determination of its members. To clarify the great righteousness, this declaration is hereby issued."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Sixth Group Wedding to Begin Registration Today; Souvenirs to Be Changed to Bronze; Excessive Banquets to Be Prohibited <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Registration for the sixth group wedding is scheduled to begin today (the 9th) and will end at the end of this month. The number of couples is set at 100. It is reported that in order to save resources after the implementation of the new currency system, the Social Affairs Bureau will not use silver for the souvenirs given to the new couples from this session onwards, but will instead use materials such as bronze and other metals in order to avoid wasting silver. The remaining funds may also be used to purchase bouquets and other items for the new couples. In addition, the Bureau stated that when the fifth group wedding was held, a post-event investigation by the Bureau found that while many of the wedding banquets were able to consider frugality, more than 20 of them were still slightly excessive and extravagant, which was not in line with the original intention of promoting group weddings.

<p>Ma Yunyan, a 39-year-old silk merchant from Pinghu, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing on the afternoon of the 5th of this month. He arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 that night. Because it was late at night and inconvenient to knock on the door of a friend's house to ask for lodging, he went to Xinglong Inn at 41 Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession and opened room number two for one night, intending to return to Pinghu the next day. He woke up at 9:00 the next morning, feeling hungry, and asked the tea room waiter, Wen Linbao, to buy him some refreshments. The door was not closed. At that time, a prostitute surnamed someone from room number one came to the door of room number two and peeked inside through the crack in the door, and began to chat with Ma. At this moment, the tea room waiter, Wen Linbao (38 years old, from Tongzhou), returned with the refreshments and, seeing the situation, accused Ma of molesting and seducing women, extorting money from Ma, and forcing Ma to pay five yuan to compensate the prostitute for her overnight fee, otherwise he would not let the matter rest. Ma, claiming that the tea room waiter's false accusation was baseless and that he had run out of travel expenses, had no choice but to endure the insults. The group then stripped Ma of his cotton robe as compensation. Ma, unable to go outside because his long robe had been taken, pleaded bitterly, and was finally stripped of a crepe de chine trousers, which was handed over to the tea room waiter to pawn. Ma then managed to escape and, feeling insulted, reported the incident to the French police station. Detective Chen Jinshan was sent to arrest the culprits, but the gangsters had already fled. Only the tea room waiter, Wen Linbao, was apprehended, the stolen goods were retrieved, and he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The lawyer of the police department, Gu Jixi, stated the case, saying that the defendant colluded with accomplices to extort money, and the police department still needed to investigate and arrest the accomplices, requesting an extension of the deadline. Next, the plaintiff, Ma Yunyan, testified about the situation of being beaten and extorted. When questioned, the defendant Wen Linshi denied participating in the scheme and claimed that it was the guest who had done it, that the guest had asked him to pawn the clothes, that the guest had left early in the night, and that the woman was also brought by the guest, whose name he did not know. When asked whether it was because he saw that the traveler was lonely and vulnerable and intentionally extorted money, Wen firmly denied it. After reviewing the confession, Judge Zhang Chaozuo ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to the 11th for further investigation.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday at noon, three people, Li Junmin and Li Fushan from Beiping, and Zhao Tujian from Lu, went to the jewelry department of the Wing On Company on Nanjing Road to purchase a diamond ring. A clerk, Tan Fuyao, took out three diamond rings for them to choose from. The three, Li et al., each took turns examining the rings. Considering the price too high, they returned the rings to Tan, who placed them back in the counter. At this time, Tan noticed that one of the rings, about one carat and worth 980 yuan, had been replaced with a fake. He immediately notified another colleague, Dong Zhenfu, to come and detain the three. During the capture, Zhao Tujian suddenly threw something into the spittoon. Upon inspection, it was the diamond ring that had been switched out. Subsequently, detectives arrived and took Li et al. into the Lao Zha gate police station. 104.50 yuan in banknotes were found on the three. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted them according to Article 339 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, all three defendants denied swapping the rings with a fake. Li Fushan even claimed that his diamond ring had been replaced with a fake by the company. Judge Dai Rongduo examined the statements and adjourned the case for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e142">China Merchants Bureau Adopts Pulverized Coal Machine, Can Save 60% of Coal Consumption <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Bureau had previously sent personnel several times to contact the Shanghai Machinery Factory on Danyang Road in this city to order pulverized coal machines for installation in the boilers of ships, in order to save coal consumption. An agreement may be reached soon. According to sources from the factory, the pulverized coal machine is a new success. It is a new invention in China. It can not only increase the firepower in the furnace, but also save 60% of coal consumption. For example, if 10 tons of coal were originally required per month, now 4 tons are sufficient. The machine is installed next to the furnace. Coal dust (not lump coal) is poured in from the coal filling point. The machine automatically grinds the coal dust into powder, and then the coal powder is blown into the furnace for combustion by wind power. The firepower is even, and even with a large amount of coal burning, there is only a small amount of residue. The machine is equipped with a thermometer, which can freely control the strength of the firepower. It is the only coal-saving machinery for large factories and the maritime industry.</p>

<p>The Qinghu Road from Shanghai to Qingpu County has been under construction for more than a year. The large and small bridges and culverts from Qingpu to the intersection of Hongqiao Road archway road in western Shanghai are due to the diverse routes and river crossings. There are as many as one hundred and sixty or seventy seats, and there are three large bridges, which have been completed one after another. However, the soil is soft, and now it has been replanned. A base layer of gravel is paved, and yellow sand and soil are paved on top. The road surface is added with cobblestone chips, so the project cost is very large. Therefore, the width of the road is narrow. With the efforts of a large number of road workers, it is estimated that it will not be completed this year. The opening date will be in the early spring at the earliest.</p>

<p>The group is currently studying Pali. Members reveal the purpose of studying abroad.</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Ceylon Study Group organized by the Shanghai General Buddhist Association of China has members such as Master Huisong, Fachou, Weihuan, Weizhi, Jiang'an, Weishi, and lay Buddhist Lin Hui. It is scheduled to go abroad to study at the end of January next year. The details are reported in the newspapers. Continue with the details below.</p>
<p>Ceylon Monk Welcomes</p>
<p>It is now learned that the members have gathered to live in the Buddhist Jingye Society on Hede Road to study English and Pali. The quota for the group is temporarily set at eight. The round-trip travel expenses are subsidized by the Buddhist Association and the Jingye Society. The study period is scheduled for five years. During the study period in Ceylon, food, clothing, and accommodation will be the responsibility of Master Narada, who previously came to Shanghai to preach. Master Narada recently sent a letter from Java to the Jingye Society, saying that he had sent his companion lay Buddhist Sirigua back to Ceylon first to contact the group regarding studying in Ceylon, and hoped that the Chinese Buddhist Ceylon Study Group should also prepare everything early.</p>
<p>Purpose of Studying Abroad</p>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the group, the mission and purpose of our going to Ceylon to study can be summarized as follows: (1) Buddhism was introduced to our country. In terms of time, it has a history of nearly two thousand years. Today, the doctrines of Chinese Buddhism, whether they are in line with the original Buddhism of India and maintain their original appearance, is a big question. The first mission of this group is to study the system of original Buddhism as a reference for reforming the system of Buddhism in our country. (2) The dissemination of Buddhism has two systems: Southern Transmission and Northern Transmission. Northern Transmission Buddhism is based on Sanskrit, while Southern Transmission Buddhism is based on Pali. This is recognized by Buddhist scholars. Our country's Buddhist scriptures are all translated from Sanskrit. So far, Southern Transmission Pali Buddhism has been less studied, translated, and introduced to the people of the country. Therefore, the second mission of this group is to study Pali Buddhism in order to prepare for translating all the scriptures of Southern Transmission after returning to the country in the future.</p>

<p>The Shangban Zhabei Water and Electricity Company and the Shanghai Inland Water Company issued a notice to all users yesterday because of the severe cold weather, fearing that the water pipes would freeze. Article 11 of the company's water sales business regulations stipulates: "Every winter, users must wrap water pipes and water meters with cotton or straw as early as possible. At night, the main switch should be turned off and the water in the pipes should be drained to avoid freezing and cracking. If the water pipes or water equipment have been frozen and cracked, they should be replaced and repaired at their own expense. Otherwise, the company will still calculate the water charges according to the meter for the water consumed due to this. The company is not responsible for the maintenance of this damage to the water meter due to freezing or other causes. The repair or compensation costs shall be borne by the user. When the water meter is frozen but not damaged, the company should be notified immediately to send a craftsman to repair or replace it without any cost." Now, because the weather is getting colder, in addition to notifying all users, the two points that should be paid attention to according to the regulations are reiterated as follows: (1) Wrap broken cotton or straw around the water meter. (2) If the water meter is frozen, please report it to the company immediately. Do not use fire to melt it yourself, otherwise, if the water meter is damaged, it will be compensated at the price. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Yisheng Foreign Goods Store Tax Evasion Case: A Huge Fine Should Be Imposed in Accordance with the Regulations; The Store Now Submits a Certificate Letter from the Chamber of Commerce and Files a Lawsuit with the Court Requesting Permission to Post Bail First <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Liu Mingjia, a Huzhou native who runs the Yisheng Foreign Goods Store at No. 54 Jixianli, Tianjin Road, was found by the Jianghai Customs to have silk worth more than 160,000 yuan that had not been subject to customs duties. The Customs cooperated with the Public Concession Police to search the store and seized one-quarter, 272 boxes, of the existing silk and handed them over to the First Special District Court for detention. Yisheng requested that the seized silk be allowed to provide a guarantee and be returned first. The court ordered that proof of the value of the seized goods be submitted before further processing. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Yisheng has sought to provide a large number of justifications, such as a certificate letter from the Chamber of Commerce, and has submitted a lawsuit to the court the day before yesterday, requesting permission to post bail. The court will hold a hearing in the next few days to investigate whether to allow bail. The customs side believes that the articles of law violated by Yisheng are Articles 21 and 22 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. Article 21 states that those who smuggle goods in and out of the country or engage in smuggling shall be fined one to three times the value of the goods. Article 22 stipulates that a fine of two to ten times the amount of undeclared tax may be imposed, and the goods may be confiscated. Therefore, if this case is established, the amount of the fine is quite considerable. In addition, the Special First District Court had doubts about whether it had the right to hear the Pinzhen Pearl Store tax evasion case, which has the same facts as Yisheng. It has submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice Administration and the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs for instructions. It has been several months now. The court has now received a reply from the Ministry ordering the Jianghai Customs and the Public Concession Bureau of Works to discuss appropriate measures and submit them to the competent authority for approval before further processing. The so-called appropriate measures refer to the right to prosecute. Therefore, the Pinzhen case is difficult to resolve at present.</p>

<h3 id="e159">A Record of a Fierce Gun Battle Between Police and Bandits in Yangjingkou Yesterday Morning: Each Side Fired More Than Ten Shots; The Bandits Eventually Escaped <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Wu Jinfu, a resident of No. 28 Caijiazhai, Yangjing Town, Pudong, runs a cigarette and paper shop. At about 2 am yesterday morning, three bandits with mixed accents, one wearing a black short shirt and two wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, broke into Wu's house with a pistol. At that time, Wu Jinfu and his wife, Liu, were sound asleep. Seeing the bandits arrive, Liu wanted to shout, but the bandit holding the gun held it against Wu's wife's chest, scaring her into silence. The other two bandits began to search. As a result, they robbed</p>
<p>5 yuan in French currency and a ring. After stealing the loot, they fled from the cigarette and paper shop and headed towards Yangjingkou. At that time, the police at Post No. 11 (about a mile from the post) had already heard the news and chased after them wildly, whistling. Inspector Zhu Yunsheng of the Yangjing Police Station heard the alarm and rushed to intercept them. The bandits fled to Yangjingkou and saw a large number of police officers chasing after them. They immediately opened fire to resist arrest. At this point, Inspector Zhu and others also opened fire, causing gun</p>
<p>bullets to crackle like a string of beads. Each side fired more than ten shots. At that time, the bandits saw that the situation was not good, so they jumped onto a sampan boat docked on the river bank and forced the boatman Peng Jinxiang to drive. At this time, the Pudong Water Patrol Detachment heard the gunshots and immediately sent a patrol boat to search the Huangpu River. As a result, because it was late at night, the three bandits relied on the power of the ferry boat to sail to the Pudong side, and then each went ashore and escaped without a trace. Later, the Water Patrol Team arrested and interrogated the sampan boatman Peng Jinxiang. When the bandits and police were shooting and fighting,</p>
<p>a stray bullet injured a passerby</p>
<p>named Xiao Sanzi. While walking through the area east of Sanjing, he was hit in the leg by a stray bullet. Blood flowed freely, and he fell to the ground in pain. The police station in charge then sent the injured Xiao Sanzi to a Pudong hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Qian Zhaofeng, also known as Peihao, a young university student from An'nan County, Guizhou, on the evening of October 16th, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, at 10:30 PM, inside the Huangjin Grand Theater in the French Concession, during the darkness of a film screening, stabbed to death his father's killer, He Zunfu, a fellow villager and former magistrate of An'nan County (36 years old at the time, previously serving in the Southwest military). The knife wound to the chest proved fatal, and he died the next day at Renji Hospital. At the time of the murder, Qian fled to the theater entrance but was apprehended by detectives. The murder weapon was found at the scene, taken to the police station, and handed over to the Special Second District Court, where the Legal Police Department filed a public prosecution for premeditated murder. During the trial, the Special Second Court transferred documents to the An'nan County Government of Guizhou for investigation, which confirmed that Qian's father, Qian Bin, was indeed killed by He. Consequently, leniency was granted according to the law, and Qian Zhaofeng was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment on February 20th of the following year, as previously reported. Qian Zhaofeng also abandoned his appeal, and the sentence was finalized, with him being sent to the Second Special District Prison on Masnan Road. Now, Qian Zhaofeng's relatives and friends, including Wang Xiaojingkan, considering Qian's filial piety in avenging his father's death, have jointly petitioned the Special Second Court, requesting leniency in granting Qian Zhaofeng a special pardon for his unserved sentence. The Special Second Court has issued a directive stating that matters of special pardon should be handled by the Judicial Yuan according to Article 37, Paragraph 2 of the Organization Law of the National Government of the Republic of China, and therefore, the request for this court to grant leniency for a special pardon should not be considered. This directive has been issued and the petitioners have been notified. It is heard that the petitioners, after receiving the directive, intend to petition higher authorities for a special pardon.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Two Charity Groups Cooperatively Report on Disaster Relief in Hubei <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Continuing Emergency Relief Efforts in Yichang, Shashi, and Jiangling; Severely Cold Winter Requires Great Attention to Cotton Clothing</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association and the Red Swastika Society have jointly undertaken disaster relief efforts for the flood disaster in Hubei Province. They have successively dispatched three major relief teams to work in the disaster areas, having already conducted relief efforts in the counties of Hanchuan, Hanyang, and Zhongxiang. The progress of these efforts has been previously reported. It is now reported that the association has received further reports from Commissioners Li Tianzhen and Yu Jiashen regarding the relief situation in various locations, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hanchuan Area</p>
<p>The Hanchuan relief effort was previously overseen by Team Leader Ouyang Dulin, and it has now been completed. In the town area of Hanchuan County, 33 Bao units were affected, with 1,844 households, 5,144 adults, and 3,092 children. In the first district, which included 8 Xiang and 169 Bao units, there were 8,421 affected households, 24,742 adults, and 15,018 children. In the second district, which included 4 Xiang and 42 Bao units, there were 2,075 affected households, 6,333 adults, and 3,912 children. In the third district, which included 7 Xiang and 154 Bao units, there were 6,860 affected households, 18,081 adults, and 9,648 children. In the fourth district, which included 4 Xiang and 89 Bao units, there were 4,723 affected households, 13,104 adults, and 5,949 children. In the fifth district, which included 4 Xiang and 89 Bao units, there were 4,119 affected households, 1,327 adults, and 5,858 children. In the sixth district, which included 5 Xiang and 111 Bao units, there were 4,122 affected households, 11,354 adults, and 6,390 children. A total of 521,030 Jin of flour, broad beans, white rice, fried rice, wheat flour, Guo Ba rice crust, and fried rice flour were distributed. In addition, 138 cotton-padded jackets and trousers, and over 300 sets of lined clothing were distributed. The team has already completed its work and is returning to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Hanyang Area</p>
<p>The second and fifth districts of the county have been surveyed. The third district, which included 23 Xiang and 97 Bao units, had 4,209 households, 10,407 adults, and 1,130 children. A total of 4,209 relief tickets were issued. In the seventh district, which included 18 Xiang, the third team had previously provided relief to 12 Xiang, with the remaining 6 Xiang still requiring continued relief.</p>
<p>Yisha Ling Area</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Yichang, Shashi, and Jiangling counties is particularly severe and was originally included in the association's relief plan. Commissioners Li Tianzhen and Yu Jiashen have been jointly recommended to conduct preliminary surveys to establish standards for relief. Han Yun and Yong Cheng have also been jointly recommended to form a relief team that will depart for the aforementioned counties in the coming days to conduct emergency relief efforts.</p>
<p>Zhongxiang Area</p>
<p>The disaster area in this county is the most severely affected in Hubei Province, particularly in the first, second, sixth, and ninth districts. Relief efforts have begun in the first district, but the area is vast, and banditry is rampant in the four Xiang, making the work particularly difficult.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for cotton clothing in the disaster areas of the province. The Red Swastika Society and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association have successively transported large quantities of cotton clothing for relief. However, the disaster area is too extensive, and supplies are insufficient. In this severe winter, the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold, and are in dire straits. It is hoped that continued donations will be raised and transported to Hankou as soon as possible, which would be an immeasurable act of merit.</p>

They say they dare not pawn it and plan to sell it for travel expenses to go home. They also arrange for their companions to pretend to bargain. Unaware of the ruse, the female servants fall into their trap. Yesterday morning on Labor Father Road, two female servants were swindled out of four yuan each.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Weimei Company Exquisitely Produces Jing County Dried Tofu <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Jing County in southern Anhui has always been known for its dried tofu. The dried tofu sold in Nanjing, Wuhu, and other places is popular because its method of production originated there. However, it has not reached its full potential. A group of individuals from Jing County believe that this dried tofu is beneficial for health and is suitable for accompanying meals, drinking wine, and enjoying tea and leisure. From the wealthy to the working class, it is a food that is indispensable for a day. However, the products of Shanghai's various tofu shops are not only unsanitary but also of poor quality. Therefore, they have pooled funds to establish the Weimei Dried Tofu Company at No. 392, Taipingfangkou, west of the Public Bus Company on Kang Naiduo Road. They have specially hired several Jing County technicians who have inherited the skills to exquisitely produce this dried tofu, in order to meet the needs of all sectors of society. It has now opened for business, and various tea and snack shops are selling its products. It produces dried tofu that surpasses those of Nanjing, Yanhutang, and other places. The locally-made Shanghai dried tofu is even inferior to them.</p>

<h3 id="e173">A Visit to the Zhanghua Woolen Textile Factory <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— By Hu Bozhou</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four basic necessities of life, and clothing ranks first. According to statistics, the total world population is approximately 1.6 billion. Among them, 5/8 are fully clothed, 1/8 are partially clothed, and 2/8 are naked. With the progress of modern culture, which is rapid and expansive, those who are partially clothed will soon be fully clothed, and those who are naked will soon be partially clothed. This is a natural trend. Therefore, the demand for the textile industry is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Woolen yarn is different from silk, hemp, cotton, and other yarns and occupies a unique place among clothing materials. In ancient China, clothing materials were only silk and hemp. After the Tang Dynasty, cotton was also used. With the opening of sea trade in modern times, foreign merchants transported woolen fabrics into China. Woolen textiles began to appear in the Chinese market and became a new material for Chinese clothing. The origin of wool textiles in Europe dates back to ancient times. As early as 500 BC, the British Isles knew how to make clothing from wool. In the 3rd century, British woolen products were famous in Rome. In the 18th century, Watt invented the steam engine, which was first used in the fine wool factories of Lancashire, marking the beginning of the modern Industrial Revolution. As a result, the output of British woolen textiles increased sharply. At that time, the total annual export value was about 6 million pounds, and woolen textiles accounted for almost half of the total.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, that is, in 1878 AD, Zuo Zongtang, the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu, believed that the processing and manufacturing of Gansu's wool could generate considerable profits. Therefore, he raised a capital of 200,000 yuan and established the Gansu Woolen Fabric Bureau in Changjia Lane, Lanzhou. The factory had a 240-horsepower engine and 21 looms, capable of producing 20 bolts of woolen fabric per day. This was the beginning of the woolen industry in China and the origin of our country's textile industry.</p>
<p>Within a year, Zuo was transferred to another position, and the Gansu Woolen Fabric Bureau was soon closed. It was not until more than 20 years later that newly established woolen textile factories began to appear in Shanghai, Beijing, Wuchang, Tianjin, and other places. The Woolen Fabric Bureau was also revived at this time. It experienced several ups and downs. Until 1934, except for the three northeastern provinces, there were still 28 woolen factories in the country, with a total capital of 3.64 million yuan and an annual output value of approximately 8.79 million yuan. Among them, 22 factories were located in Shanghai. Due to the small capital of each factory and the heavy reliance on foreign sources for raw materials, development was extremely difficult. In recent years, more and more Chinese people have adopted Western clothing, and foreign woolen textiles have poured in, reaching a huge value of 19 million customs taels per year. Revitalizing the domestic woolen textile industry to stem the outflow of wealth requires the joint efforts of patriots across the country.</p>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation of the woolen textile industry, the reporter recently visited the Zhanghua Woolen Textile Factory, the largest factory in the city, with the Commercial and Industrial Visit Group of this newspaper. The following is a brief description of what I saw during the visit, for the reference of readers:</p>
<p>The factory was built in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, covering an area of more than 30 mu. The factory buildings are spacious, with flower beds and lawns inside the gate. The layout is clean, and the lighting and air are good. It was founded in 1929 with a capital of 800,000 yuan. It employs more than 400 male and female workers. Wages are calculated by piece. Female workers can earn 3 to 7 jiao per day, and male workers can earn 5 jiao to 2 yuan per day, with an average of about 6 or 7 jiao.</p>
<p>After the reporter and his party arrived at the factory, Mr. Xu of the factory warmly welcomed us and led us to visit various departments. The following is a summary of the working procedures seen that day.</p>
<p>1. Washing and Drying Wool</p>
<p>Wool is covered with oil and dust, which cannot be completely removed without washing. The method is to first store a considerable amount of hot and cold water, soda ash, and soap in each water tank of the washing machine. After they are dissolved, wool is added. Through the force of the machine, the wool is repeatedly turned and stirred. The wool is moved from the front tank to the back tank. The oil and dust are removed through chemical action and machine pressing, resulting in pure wool. Then, the wool is dried by a drying machine, ready for the second step of work. There are three drying machines, which can dry 5,000 pounds of wool per day.</p>
<p>2. Mixing and Carding Wool</p>
<p>In order to make the type, color, and cost of the fabric suitable for market prices, various colored wools or other fibers are often mixed and subjected to mixing and carding. The method is to first lay a layer of one type of wool flat on the ground, add a considerable amount of oil, and then lay other wool or fibers on top of it. This process is repeated until all the wool that needs to be mixed is laid. The wool is then carded and mixed by a carding machine to prepare it for the combing machine.</p>
<p>3. Combing Wool</p>
<p>The combing process is the most important and difficult process in woolen textile manufacturing. Even a slight defect can affect the entire process. The method is to use a wire carding machine, with three units as a group. The wool passes through the first wire carding machine, where it is combed, brushed, and rolled up. Short fibers that cannot be spun into yarn are removed, resulting in a wool web. The wool web then passes through the second and third wire carding machines, where the same work is done with even finer details, resulting in strips of considerable thickness. The strips are then rolled onto wooden sticks, ready to be moved to the spinning machine.</p>
<p>4. Spinning</p>
<p>Spinning is the process of spinning the wool strips obtained from the combing process into the required count, and winding it onto a paper tube in preparation for weaving. Coarse woolen yarn, with a count of 3, is used for making carpets. Fine woolen yarn has a count of 14 to 18 or even 20.</p>
<p>5. Weaving</p>
<p>In the weaving process, the warp yarn is first subjected to the processes of winding, warping, sizing, and threading through the reed. It is then placed on the loom, where it is interwoven with the weft yarn to form a fabric with a specific structure. The factory has a total of 66 looms, manufactured in Germany and Belgium.</p>
<p>6. Dyeing</p>
<p>The dyeing process varies depending on the type of fabric. Some are dyed before spinning and weaving, some are dyed after spinning into yarn, and some are dyed after weaving into bolts of fabric. Generally, multi-colored fabrics are dyed before spinning, while single-colored fabrics are dyed after weaving into bolts.</p>
<p>7. Finishing</p>
<p>Finishing is the final process of woolen textiles. The work varies depending on the type of woolen fabric. Common processes include mending, washing, shrinking, dewatering, singeing, raising, brushing, shearing, pressing, steaming, and folding.</p>
<p>8. Reeling and Packaging</p>
<p>After the above processes, the woolen textiles have become a finished product. For the convenience of transportation, woolen yarn is reeled into skeins and packaged. Woolen fabrics must be rolled, stamped, and then wrapped before they can be packaged and sold.</p>
<p>The factory's working procedures are roughly as described above. Most of the raw materials used in the factory are wool from Xining and Huzhou in China. However, the breed and raising of sheep have not been studied enough, and the wool quality is relatively coarse and stiff. The amount of impurities and dust is as high as 55%, and at least 25%. Therefore, the factory has a separate wool sorting department, where skilled workers specialize in removing impurities. A small portion of the wool is purchased from Australia and Czechoslovakia for making fine fabrics.</p>
<p>Most of the products are sold in the Yangtze River basin, with smaller sales in North China and South China. Business conditions: Sales last year were approximately 3 million yuan. This year's sales are less than last year. At the same time, due to the dumping of foreign goods, the factory had to lower its selling prices. The current prices of various goods are almost half of what they were three years ago. Not only is there no profit, but there is also an annual deficit, making it difficult to be optimistic about the future. In addition, the shortage of working capital prevents large-scale production, which is also a reason for the lack of progress. The former is a national industrial problem that cannot be solved by one factory alone, so we will not discuss it further here. The latter requires the managers to carefully plan and find ways to improve it.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Scota Cup Second Round: Tung Wah Tied with French Merchants 3-3, Intense Battle Sees Tung Wah's Lead Erased Late by French Merchants, YMCA Fails Despite Strong Lineup, Losing to Western Police 2-3 <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Scota Cup second round saw two Chinese teams, Tung Wah and YMCA, compete yesterday, braving the rain. Neither team achieved their desired outcome. Tung Wah faced French Merchants at the Recreation Ground, resulting in a 3-3 draw. YMCA played Western Police at the Shen Garden. Western Police, with their veteran players returning to form, displayed sudden strength. Despite YMCA taking an early two-goal lead, they conceded three goals in a row, leading to their defeat, a regrettable outcome. Detailed accounts of the two matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Draws with French Merchants</p>
<p>3-3</p>
<p>French Merchants Start Strong, Tung Wah Recovers to Lead, but Concedes Late Equalizer. Tung Wah, the reigning Scota Cup champion, faced French Merchants yesterday at the Recreation Ground. French Merchants have won all four of their league matches this season. Despite the rain, their Scota Cup match drew a large crowd, with nearly ten thousand spectators packing the north and south stands. However, the slippery field caused players to fall frequently. Tung Wah led 3-2 at halftime. After switching sides, Tung Wah's attack was strong, but they missed several good opportunities. In the final ten minutes, French Merchants managed to equalize. Chen Jixiang was the referee. The match details are as follows:</p>
<p>"Barbarian Horns" Announce Strong Opposition</p>
<p>The two teams faced off, ready for battle. French Merchants displayed well-balanced strength, with a menacing presence. Little Walter led the charge, advancing into Chinese territory. The ball was passed left to Baughault, who waited for an opportunity to shoot, finding the net and opening the scoring. Cao Qiuting, filled with righteous anger, led a counterattack, with Li Yichen closely following. Remidi Baoqisi tried to defend, but Cao and Li outmaneuvered him. Qiuting signaled, and Li "Iron Leg" unleashed a powerful shot, quickly retaliating. After the center kick-off, French Merchants' five forwards surged forward, putting Tung Wah's defense under pressure. Fafanxiao attempted to break through, but Pan An blocked the ball. Little Walter seized the opportunity, striking again and scoring another goal for French Merchants. The French Merchants displayed fierce aggression, looking down on everyone. The foreign spectators cheered loudly, causing worry among the Chinese supporters, especially with the drizzling rain adding to the somber atmosphere.</p>
<p>Youliang and Yichen Score Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>Seeing the French Merchants' strong attack and facing constant pressure, Tung Wah's players fought with determination, displaying the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation. Li Yichen pointed his flag eastward, and the crowd cheered him on. Reaching the appropriate position, General Li evaded Baoqisi and passed to Youliang, who fired a shot, leveling the score at 2-2. Inspired by this comeback, Tung Wah's defense became impenetrable. Despite their strength, French Merchants could not assert their dominance. Cao Qiuting, with whip and staff in hand, launched an uprising from the border, directly challenging the enemy's defense. Li Yichen assisted from the left and right, turning the tide. Remidi resisted the royal army, but Cao and Li deftly evaded him. As they approached the enemy's fortress, Qiuting sent a cross, and Yichen leapt to strike, hitting the crossbar. Despite Xiang Sai Zhong's efforts, he was helpless to stop it. At 3-2, Tung Wah displayed the spirit of the champion, ending the first half.</p>
<p>French Merchants Equalize at the End</p>
<p>After the break, Tung Wah's attack was fierce. Within ten minutes, they repeatedly broke into the enemy's territory, but the slippery conditions led to missed opportunities. Most regrettably, at the fifteen-minute mark, Youliang launched an attack from the right corner. Bai Sai Zhong jumped to catch the ball, but unfortunately, it struck the crossbar and bounced back. Seeing the French Merchants stubbornly persisting in their aggression and repeatedly invading their territory, the royal army was pressed and resisted. Thus, they advanced with all five forwards. French Merchants lacked internal support and external reinforcements. Parker rushed to defend, and Bai Sai Zhong bravely attempted to save the goal, resulting in a corner kick. At this point, Tung Wah missed several good chances, leading to sighs of regret from the spectators. As most of the time had passed, the game remained stable without further progress. Tung Wah aimed to maintain their lead, switching from offense to defense. Unfortunately, misfortune struck. The central area suddenly became chaotic. The enemy cavalry charged, creating a confused situation. Fortunately, several enemy attacks were blocked. However, in the end, Da Huater shot from the right corner, and Baughault, lurking near the goal, headed the ball into the net, resulting in an equalizer. Tung Wah launched a desperate counterattack. Dai Linjing made a solo run, but his shot was too hasty and went wide. Afterwards, the situation was irreversible. Qiu Shi was substituted due to injury. After a brief struggle, the final whistle blew. Tung Wah, in a seemingly winning position, ended up with a 3-3 draw, with no clear victor.</p>

<p>YMCA Loses to Western Police</p>
<p>3…2</p>
<p>YMCA Shows Excellent Performance and Leads in the First Half</p>
<p>Western Police Fight Back and Gain Advantage in the Second Half</p>
<p>The YMCA faced Western Police in the Western Union's Scota Cup match. Despite the rain, the game was held yesterday at 3 PM in Shen Garden. Both sides possessed strong players, making the contest evenly matched and exciting. YMCA led 2-1 at halftime. In the second half, Western Police counterattacked, scoring two consecutive goals to turn the tide and win the match. The final score was 3-2 in favor of Western Police.</p>
<p>Aggressive Start Leads to Two Goals</p>
<p>At exactly 3 PM, the rain continued to fall steadily. Despite the wet field, both teams arrived on time. As the whistle blew, the two teams lined up. YMCA took the offensive first. Zhong Yuxiang dribbled and led the attack, but was intercepted halfway by Gashu. Xiao Heitan attacked from the flank, breaking through three lines of defense and unleashing a powerful shot at the goal. Man Yin, unable to defend, conceded the opening goal. Gaining the advantage, YMCA's morale soared, and their momentum became unstoppable. Led by Zhong Yuxiang, they marched aggressively into enemy territory. Xiao Tuo defended well, turning danger into safety. Shen Shiqi dashed out from the side and passed to the center. Liu Shizan controlled the ball, making a significant contribution.</p>
<p>Western Police Counterattacks and Scores One Goal</p>
<p>After conceding one goal, Western Police were determined to fight to the death. Their spirit changed the game. The five forwards attacked from the flanks with irresistible momentum. The situation became perilous in YMCA's territory. Wei Li saw that repeated attacks were unsuccessful, so he charged in a rage, regardless of the consequences. He succeeded in taking back one goal. Inspired, the Western players seemed revitalized, especially the two generals Wei Li and Hoer, who displayed excellent performance. Unfortunately, due to poor shooting accuracy, they wasted their efforts. Soon after, Xiao Tuo committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Xiao Heitan took the kick, but the ball hit the goalkeeper. Time ran out, and YMCA won the first half 2-1.</p>
<p>Western Police Fight to the Death and Turn Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>After the break, the game resumed on the other side of the field. Western Police, determined to break the boat and sink it, counterattacked fiercely. The forwards charged together, and the ball hovered in front of YMCA's goal. Suddenly, Wei Li raised his leg and shot, but the ball hit the post and bounced back. However, Xiao Zhang was so frightened that his soul left his body. Wei Li did not give up and tried again, intercepting Xu Jingcheng's pass. He rushed forward bravely, and Zhang Rongcai had to dive to save the ball. Hoer caught up and seized the opportunity, tying the score. At this point, YMCA's morale was renewed. The five forwards charged back and forth as if there was no one there. However, they lacked accuracy and did not score. Conversely, the enemy general Walklai launched a surprise attack, working with Jack to break through three defensive lines. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Zhang Rongcai rushed out to defend. Jack secretly passed to Kui Kailai, who fired a cold arrow. Fortunately, the ball went over the goal and did not hit. Wei Li rose again in the center, launching another attack. Xiao Zhang was flustered and rushed out to block, but the ball rolled into the net. Xiao Heitan was furious and vowed to avenge this humiliation, ordering a general attack. Generals Shen and Zhong ambushed on the border, taking the opportunity to raid the camp. Sure enough, the enemy general fell for the trap and left his defense. Shen and Zhong seized the opportunity to surround them, but luck was not on their side. At the twelve-yard mark, they passed the enemy's goal three times without scoring. This was the reason for YMCA's failure. At this point, with only nine minutes left, Western Police changed their tactics, focusing on defense and deliberately kicking the ball around to waste time, denying YMCA any chance of revenge. In the end, they lost to Western Police 3-2. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>

<p>North China Sports Federation Convenes Third Standing Committee Meeting, Football and Basketball Preliminary Set for January in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Beiping Communication) The various representative teams for China's participation in the 11th Olympic Games will hold a final selection in Shanghai in April and May of next year. The football and basketball representative teams, with East China, North China, and South China as units, will hold a preliminary selection in Shanghai on January 25th of next year. In order to discuss matters related to the preliminary selection with the directors of the North China Sports Federation, Ma Yuehan, Yuan Lidun, and Dong Shouyang, the secretary-general of the Chinese National Sports Association, Shen Siliang, specifically took a China Aviation Company flight to Beiping on the 6th. That evening, the North China Sports Federation convened its third Standing Committee meeting, deciding on important matters. Shen also made a statement to reporters after the meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting Convened to Decide on Principles</p>
<p>The third Standing Committee meeting of the North China Sports Federation was attended by four standing committee members: Ma Yuehan, Yuan Lidun, Dong Shouyi, and Zhao Wenzao. Shen Siliang and Zeng Zhonglu were present as observers. The meeting, chaired by Yuan Lidun, decided on two important proposals: (1) How to generate the football and basketball representative teams of North China to participate in the world games preliminary in China? (Resolved) It was decided to select in Tianjin on January 18, 19, 20 and 23 of the 25th year, and to nominate Zhang Jiwu, Tian Zhihui, Chen Wenhuang and Song Ruiting as preparation committee members. The basketball selection committee members are Gai Shouyi, Song Junfu and Qi Shouyu, the football selection committee members are Ma Yuehan, Song Junfu and Ruan Zhizhen, the basketball instructor is Li Qingan, the football instructor is Ma Yuehan, and the manager is Hou Luoxun. (2) Whether the second Shanghai Sports Performance Fair should be held. (Resolved) It was decided to hold it in Tianjin in January of the 25th year, and to nominate Zhang Jiwu, Qi Shouyu, Chuan Jingru, Tian Zhihui, and Song Ruiting to organize the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Siliang Will Return to Shanghai This Week</p>
<p>After the meeting, Shen told reporters that this participation of our country in the World Games is still the first time ever, and the results cannot be predicted. In short, it all depends on whether the sports circles of our country can work together. As for the expenses for participating in the World Games, the government has approved 170,000 yuan. The track and field preliminary election will be held in Shanghai in April next spring, and the preliminary election will be held in separate districts. Swimming and national martial arts still have to depend on the cost to determine, and basically one or two people can be selected. For race walking, two or more people will be selected. The three items still need to be discussed finally. It is planned to select one person for weightlifting. I heard that Qiaozhong has excellent results in this event and is currently looking for it. I am scheduled to return to Shanghai next week, and tomorrow morning (7th) I will accompany Ma Yuehan, Zhao Wenzao, Yuan Lijiao, and Dong Shouyi to Tianjin to attend the wedding of Mr. Zhang Jiwu and Ms. Zhang Shudi.</p>

<p>Principal Xiao Youmei Reports, Wang Shijie and Others Deliver Addresses</p>
<p>The National Conservatory of Music was established eight years ago. Now that the provisional funds from Fengxian have been issued by the government, land has been purchased in the city center of Shanghai City, at Shijing Road, together with donations collected over the years, to build school buildings. After nine months, the main school building and the western practice room have been completed. The school held the school building completion ceremony and the eighth anniversary concert at the school's new auditorium yesterday. Among those present were Minister of Education Wang Shijie, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education Lei Zhen, representative of the Municipal Party Committee Cao Peizi, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government Luo Peihui, principals of major secondary schools in Beijing and Shanghai Luo Jialun, Liu Zhanen, Weng Zhilong, Yan Fuqing, etc., and reporters from local newspapers and over 600 people from all walks of life. First, the school principal Xiao Youmei delivered an opening speech and reported on the construction process and future plans. Then, the representative of the Municipal Party Committee Cao Peizi, the Minister of Education Wang Shijie, the representative of the Municipal Government Ba Peihui, and the principal of Hujiang University Liu Zhanen delivered speeches successively. The speeches were inspiring, and the audience responded with warm applause. In his speech, Minister Wang said that the Conservatory of Music must have two conditions in the future: those who come to study should know the responsibilities they bear and determine that the purpose of learning music is to serve music, and should not be reduced to leisure decoration or commercialization. The school should have a self-awareness of its mission, cultivate music teachers, so that China's new music can quickly gain a large audience. If the masses can understand high-level music, it will be easier to effectively transform customs and inspire the people, and the country's expectations for setting up the school will not be in vain. After the meeting, photos were taken in front of the school building, followed by a student concert. Due to time constraints, the program was shorter than usual, but all the students showed excellent results. After the performance, there was a tea party in the school's reception room. The occasion was unprecedentedly grand.</p>

<p>— Cheng Shanglin</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Recently, economic forums have been rife with debate. To summarize, there are issues concerning the emphasis on heavy industry versus agriculture in the economic construction process, currency inflation versus the devaluation of silver, trade deficits versus China's interests, and whether silver outflows are fundamentally caused by international trade deficits. Regarding the first issue, many people within the country have discussed it. I myself have repeatedly commented on it in two articles: "The Unified Economic Construction and the Rural Revitalization and National Rejuvenation," Note (1), and "An Investigation into the Causes and Countermeasures of Urban Fatigue and Rural Bankruptcy," Note (2). I will not elaborate further here. I will explain the latter three issues, (2), (3), and (4), in separate writings. Now, I specifically raise a problem for discussion: that is, the "Issue of National Consumption Amidst the Clamor for Economic Construction," as written in the title of this article.</p>
<p>II. Reasons for Raising the Issue</p>
<p>Although there are many focuses of debate in the current Chinese economic forum, one opinion is shared by the majority: that the advancement of Chinese economic construction is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>For example, proponents of heavy industry argue that the urgent priority for saving China is industrial construction. While proponents of agriculture argue that saving China should start with popularizing education through rural movements, they do not dare to openly raise other reasons for opposition, except to lament that national strength is temporarily insufficient to accomplish industrial science construction. Not only that, but whenever there is an opportunity to apply science, they always try their best to adopt scientific methods. Dingxian, Hebei's use of new surgical techniques for raising pigs and chickens, and the lack of electric lights in Zouping, Shandong, leading to the association of the lack of scientific talent, Note (3), is one example. Furthermore, Mr. Zhao Lanping, while not admitting that "trade deficits are the fundamental cause of silver outflows," also admits that "everything industry belonging to foreigners is China's great problem." Note (4) Mr. Gu Jigao, although believing that "trade deficits are not necessarily harmful to China," also advocates using foreign capital to build "inland industrial zones." Note (5) is another explanation for this point. In addition, amid the calls for Sino-Japanese cooperation, the Japanese side advocates developing North China, and the American economic survey team, after returning to their country, also advocates assisting China in exploiting its rich reserves. Note (6) shows that foreigners also advocate the necessity of China's material enrichment, even if their starting points may be different.</p>
<p>However, one thing we cannot ignore is this: does the goal of economic construction focus on the military aspect, or on the entire national economy? If, according to the views of some heavy industry advocates, the focus is on the entire national economy, then in China today, where the national economy is collapsing and purchasing power is generally weak, the sales of industrial products are a serious problem. In a situation where imported goods have long been accustomed to, whether domestically produced industrial products can compete with foreign goods is another question.</p>
<p>Therefore, this topic is specifically raised for discussion.</p>
<p>III. The Significance of the Consumption Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the problems to be solved during China's economic construction, there are many more than just the consumption issue. For example, there is the issue of capital or the use of foreign capital during economic construction. However, the term "capital" essentially only includes land, labor, and raw materials. However, when discussing economic construction within China, the so-called land is of course not a problem. Labor? It is true that China's education is knowledge in books, lacking specialized technical engineers. But this is only a small component of the labor force. The borrowing of foreign talent, as long as no one hinders it and, more importantly, it is employment-based and used properly, is also not a problem. As for the majority of laborers, in China today, where disasters are frequent and life hangs by a thread, it is even less of a problem. What is lacking is only the issue of the machine, a double capital regarded as a means of production, and the issue of wages when employing laborers—or the necessary living expenses. However, the issue of equipment is a problem that lies between using foreign capital and purchasing foreign goods. If a certain industry needs to be established during economic construction, it is necessary to purchase a certain machine. And the price required to purchase this machine is not something that China's financial strength can temporarily afford, then a credit arrangement is possible, and borrowing a certain amount of money from a certain country, stipulating that all must be used to purchase goods from that country, is also possible. Note (7) Bartering. Note (8) China can also suffer a little loss. As long as it is carried out under the principle of not harming China's sovereignty and being beneficial to the future of economic construction. As for wages when employing people—or the issue of labor remuneration known as necessary daily living expenses, this can be divided into two aspects. One is the guest staff aspect, and the other is the Chinese people's laborer aspect. Regarding guest staff, their employment wages and remuneration, in addition to being remitted abroad after living and consuming in China, must still be paid in cash, which is not something we need to consider. However, the borrowing of specialized personnel and guest staff is certainly a minority component, so the monthly compensation required, although higher compared to Chinese nationals, is probably not too astonishing to pay. The payment of the necessary living funds for domestic workers, in today's government-centralized silver, can of course be paid with fiat currency. However, the government only centralizes silver and does not advocate currency inflation. To maintain the credit of fiat currency, the issuance of fiat currency will ultimately have a limit that is proportional to the amount of silver reserves. If we extrapolate further, then it will involve the currency issue itself. However, the distribution of labor wages must ultimately be in the form of fiat currency equivalent to cash. This can also be considered an important issue in production and construction.</p>
<p>Whether the policy of devaluing silver or currency inflation can be implemented in China, and what its effects will be, is not the scope of this article to discuss. However, when economic construction is carried out in China, if the purchase of foreign machinery and the borrowing of specialized technical talent can be realized as ideally, then the necessary expenses required in the economic construction process, such as wages, or the purchase of certain domestic goods materials, (for example, the establishment of a lacquer factory requires the purchase of domestic tung oil, the establishment of a dye factory requires the purchase of Chinese gallnuts, and replacing gasoline with charcoal alcohol requires the purchase of domestic raw materials), will require a relatively considerable amount of capital turnover and maintenance. This kind of capital, to put it bluntly, is currency. In the present, it can naturally also be said to be fiat currency. But it is expressed between "raw materials" and "labor," so it occupies the name of "capital." Secondly, speaking of the distribution issue, if the goal of economic construction is focused on military industrial needs, such as the manufacture of guns, ammunition, warships, and airplanes, then it will not be distributed among the national people at all. Of course, we do not need to worry too much about the promotion of domestically produced goods. But, if it is believed that economic construction is for the sake of the entire national consumption, then whether it is light industry such as daily necessities, or heavy industry such as machinery, if the sales outlet is to find a market overseas, that seems a bit too ideal. If consumers are to be found domestically, then it is necessary to target all the national people. The significance of the so-called consumption issue originally lies in this.</p>
<p>IV. The Importance of the Consumption Issue</p>
<p>Many people divide the countries of the world into two natures: one is capitalism, and the other is socialism. The difference between capitalism and socialism lies in whether the distribution of goods is determined by currency, especially through the process of commercial transactions. Regarding socialist system doctrines, there are originally many factions, including anarchism, communism, guild socialism, etc. However, at present, on the earth today in the 20th century, the only socialist system country that can stand and support itself is Soviet Russia. Therefore, when discussing socialism, from the utilitarian viewpoint that power is truth, it is necessary to take Russia as a typical example—there is only one socialist country, so there is no way to further divide it. Regarding capitalist countries, from the point of view of the private property system, then apart from Soviet Russia, it can be said that everything in this world is like this, and China is of course no exception. However, the point that the law allows the private property system, apart from Soviet Russia, is something that China shares with other countries. But the disparity between rich and poor, the advancement and backwardness of the stage of economic development, especially the difference in the political environment, means that China cannot be compared with any of the industrialized countries, whether advanced or not. Therefore, the existence of a consumption system in Chinese society, with currency as the main body of distribution, reveals its major flaws in China itself, where the industrial revolution process has not been completed and it has become a colony of other capitalist countries. These flaws are also different from those in Europe, America, and neighboring industrialized countries. In the industrialized countries of Europe and America, the existence of the private property social system makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, forming a sharp opposition between the rich and poor classes. As a result, they cannot overcome their internal contradictions and alleviate their internal panic without finding colonies and markets abroad. China is one of their colonial targets. But China is very different. China is an environment where it is exploited as a colony. Apart from a very small number of bureaucratic compradors, the rest of the national people are entirely poor. The economic life of the whole is difficult. China's inability to support its semi-self-sufficiency is due to internal natural and man-made disasters on the one hand, and external exploitation of resources and profits on the other. Therefore, the consumption system issue in China is not only an issue of equal distribution, but also an issue of how to enrich and develop the supply of materials, and create national consumption for all. In recent years, the basis for talking about economic construction has been based on this.</p>
<p>Although there is nothing to divide and nothing to share, we cannot ignore the significance of the fact that China is a private property society. Therefore, in China's current stage, material poverty is real and it cannot be self-sufficient. Most people either suffer from natural disasters or are burdened by man-made disasters, and their lives are not guaranteed from morning to evening. A small number of people, because they can share the remnants of foreign exploitation of Chinese profits, can use foreign goods to satisfy their worldly extravagance. Therefore, in Chinese society, there is actually a sharp opposition between a small number of bureaucratic compradors and the vast majority of poor people. Therefore, when economic construction is implemented, the domestically produced industrial products are already a problem because a small number of rich people are accustomed to using foreign goods, and what method do the majority of poor people use to consume and distribute domestically produced goods because they are plagued by natural and man-made disasters? This is the need for disaster relief, not the need for replenishment with cash. What method do they use to consume and distribute domestically produced goods? Otherwise, if it is the need for replenishment with cash, it means there is money but no goods, then a large number of foreign goods entering is simply eating without plowing, clothing without weaving, and gaining without labor. Why bother talking about economic regeneration and economic construction? Because in the 20th century, where currency is the main body of exchange in the world, China, which has been exploited and invaded for six or seven decades, not only lacks materials, but also suffers from financial panic. The importance of the consumption issue amid the calls for economic construction can be imagined from this point, because China is now in a time of national economic hardship and extremely weak purchasing power.</p>
<p>V. Fundamental Transformation or Unilateral Improvement?</p>
<p>Many people who study economics can understand that China now not only lacks materials, but also suffers from financial depletion. Therefore, they advocate developing China's production as a way to supplement material supplies, make up for trade deficits, and restore prosperity to the market. However, they still cannot abandon a wrong preconceived idea in this imagination. What is this wrong preconceived idea? It is that as long as production is developed, it can save China from poverty, thaw the situation of financial freeze, and stop international trade deficits. But they do not understand that developing production can enrich material life is a theoretical logic. If products cannot be universally distributed among all national consumers, then the situation of financial freeze will still not be thawed, and the plan to enrich the entire national life will still not be realized, which is a practical necessity. According to the idealists' view, China is backward in production, and as long as production is developed, China can be promoted to a successful modern road. Then, all established Chinese-led enterprises can operate prosperously, and there should be no risk of business depression or bankruptcy. However, this is not the case. As long as you open the daily and monthly publications, you will know that China's industry is getting worse and worse, and bankruptcy and shutdowns are seen every few days. Why is this? The influence of foreign commodity dumping policies is certainly the biggest reason. However, the fact that domestic industrial production is for business and profit is also a reason. If it can be rationally and universally distributed among all national people for consumption, then even if the foreign commodity dumping policy is more intense, in fact, the prosperity of China's industry can still be expected soon. Try to comprehensively statistically analyze the annual imports of foreign goods and the amount of China's own production, and then make a consumption comparison of the population figures, and you will know that what I said is not false.</p>
<p>Naturally, what I said is not that no one has noticed. In recent years, the call to revitalize rural areas and the implementation of bank investment in rural areas, although motivated by the lack of outlets for funds, (Note 9), and political factors, (Note 10), the significance of restoring the general national purchasing power and stimulating industrial and commercial prosperity is consistent. Unfortunately, this superficial relief cannot have a fundamental effect. The reasons are:</p>
<p>(1) The national trauma is too deep, and unilateral relief is ultimately a drop in the bucket, with no real effect.</p>
<p>(2) Natural and man-made disasters, especially the communist floods, further expand the extent of people's displacement and bankruptcy, making it feel that the relief is not enough.</p>
<p>(3) The government only talks about revitalizing rural areas, only seeing empty words. Banks implement investment in rural areas for business purposes, not for relief purposes, so there are restrictions, and it cannot be popularized to the vast majority of people in extreme poverty.</p>
<p>(4) In today's society where commercial transactions are the main body of consumption and distribution, domestic goods are difficult to compete with foreign goods, and domestic goods factories are difficult to compete with foreign factories, (Note 11). As a result, even if the people's purchasing power can be restored, it will only consume more foreign goods, causing silver to flow out even more. Moreover, economic construction is a slow process, and until now, only calls have been heard, and it has not been implemented in practice.</p>
<p>Of these four reasons, apart from the last one, which is temporarily put aside, the other three reasons are enough to explain that the consumption issue of economic construction cannot be effective in today's commercial distribution system. At this point, some people have taken a bolder step and proposed methods such as commodity certificate systems and village-owned land systems. Regarding the merits and demerits of commodity certificates and village-owned land, and what the results of implementation under China's actual environment would be, are not the scope of this article. Now, let's compare this distribution method with the consumption issue of economic construction in terms of its general meaning, and see what its merits and demerits are.</p>
<p>Yes, due to the import of Western cultural ideas and theories, many people like to pursue the more ideal and vague dream of "each according to their ability, each according to their need." However, putting aside all political factions for the moment, from an economic point of view, the factor of material poverty is the greatest obstacle to the realization of the "ideal world."</p>
<p>Although, due to the poverty of China's entire national economic life, the doctrine of socialism, or persuasion of other countries' people, is more likely to arouse interest, that is true. But arousing interest is one thing, whether it can be implemented in practice is another thing. Do not be concerned about the colonial environment of China and the era when Russia changed the national system during the intense European war. However, when Russia implemented the initial era of military communism, the suffering of its people's lives and the poverty of material supplies are probably not forgotten by those who are concerned about world affairs. May I ask, how can the system of each according to their ability and each according to their need be realized in the current stage of China, when economic construction has not even begun? So, it is impossible for China to achieve the socialization of distribution at the present time. That means the commercial transaction distribution system still has a reason for its existence. Understanding this point, we will have the following thoughts on the method of village-owned land and commodity certificates.</p>
<p>1: The production method that proceeds according to the principle of economic construction to enrich material equipment should be collective farms, scientific electrical methods of cultivation. The method of distributing village-owned land or those who cultivate have their fields, from a consumption point of view, may be able to suppress the opposition of the landlord and tenant classes if handled well, but it does not help the country develop production and enrich scientific equipment.</p>
<p>2: It is not known whether the commodity certificate system is distributed according to consumption standards or labor capacity standards. If it is due to the former, putting aside the currency issue and distributing commodity certificates according to each person's consumption capacity, then the ideal world has simply been realized. At the very least, it can be said that the government has become a disaster relief agency. Some disabled, sick, elderly, and weak people who have no opportunity to work or are unwilling to work do not have to worry about life. The government's power is probably not able to do this! If it is due to the latter, then whether everyone has the opportunity and skills to work apart from the elderly, weak, and disabled is probably still a question! If it is at the time of being young, strong, skilled, and willing to work, but there is no opportunity to work, then the difficulty of obtaining commodity certificates is probably the same as the economic plight of the unemployed now. That being said, apart from the two points of easing the panic of cash shortages and restricting the national people from using domestic goods, the issuance of commodity certificates does not help the entire national consumption method much.</p>
<p>It can be seen that a one-sided relief strategy that can be universal among all the national people in the consumption system does not exist. A fundamental reform strategy is also difficult to implement.</p>
<p>VI. State Capitalism or State Socialism?</p>
<p>Regarding economic construction, there is another meaning that we cannot ignore. That is, is the purpose of economic construction to enrich national power or to enrich national life? Originally, the state and the people are related. If the people's lives are difficult, it is not seen that the state can enrich its strength. If national strength is weak, the people's lives are bound to be restricted. However, this issue is not so simple in China, especially in the 20th century. The national economy is bankrupt, and national strength is also weakened as a result, which is the reality. But if national strength is strong, the national economy will also be abundant. This seems to have only a relative reason and no absolute basis. For example, I don't need to give examples, and it is not convenient to give examples. But is China's economic construction ultimately intended for national wealth and strength, or for the people's actual lives? If it is due to the former, then the intelligent will know the feelings after reading the news that the military industry in Germany and Italy, which lack colonies, is prosperous, but the people's lives cannot be enriched. Not to mention building shipyards and airplane manufacturing plants, etc. Even the construction of roads in some provinces in the country has exhausted a lot of effort, to the point of increasing the government's task of relieving people's economic bankruptcy, then it can be known that the development of purely military industry is not only without this power for a while, but also the government is unwilling to do so. If it is due to the latter, then the difficulty of solving the consumption issue and the temporary difficulty of implementing a universal social distribution system - especially the implementation of foreign goods' price reduction dumping policy, which restricts the commercial distribution method of currency purchases (the restoration of national purchasing power is only to promote more foreign goods. The fact that the annual import of foreign rice reaches an average of 16,364,167 dan, and that some rural rice cannot be sold, is enough to explain this point). In this way, the road that China's economic construction takes, from the point of distribution, the road of capitalism cannot be taken, and the road of socialism cannot be taken either.</p>
<p>China, a semi-colonial country, should also open up new paths outside of capitalism and socialism.</p>
<p>VII. Conclusion: Control or Cooperation?</p>
<p>The difficulty of solving the distribution method in China has been briefly explained in the previous paragraphs. However, the difficulty of solving the consumption distribution issue is one thing, and the urgent need for economic construction is another thing. China's current situation is that everything is advancing under the situation of taking one step forward and two steps back. The advancement of economic construction is of course no exception. Understanding this point, the initial economic construction is actually the most difficult and painful undertaking. Some enterprises, whether state-owned or commercially operated, will inevitably suffer losses on the produced goods when they are founded, and even have no market outlet. If this point can be noted and recognized, and even more so, with the determination to sacrifice and continue to fight with indomitable courage, then after several years, the fruit of victory can be seen. The problem is only whether the government and social figures have this determination and power to sacrifice in the process of economic construction. Otherwise, if the beautiful name of economic construction is used to pursue commodity profits, then the difficulty of supporting domestic goods factories now is enough to show that economic construction is a road that does not work.</p>
<p>However, economic construction, for the purpose of increasing the wealth of the state or the people, and pursuing profits, is actually inevitable under the commercial-dominated exchange distribution system. If the state or the people realize that economic construction is bound to suffer losses or fail, then no one will carry it out at all, so how can the stalemate of economic panic be broken? Therefore, the problem will turn to control or cooperation, the significance of which is to find ways to reduce the degree of loss and the crisis of goods being stranded. On the other hand, the state can, under this situation, not formally take the road of socialism, nor take the road of capitalism. (In fact, there is no ability to take these two roads at all.) And distribute the seemingly surplus goods to all the toiling masses, and transfer the "labor" that all or most of the unemployed toiling masses have nowhere to sell to heavy industrial economic construction, military industrial construction, and national defense industrial construction. It can solve the difficulty of the distribution and consumption method, so that the goods of the initial light industry will not be stranded, and heavy industry can proceed. It is beneficial to both the state and the people. And in terms of the consumption issue, the commodity promotion issue, and the heavy industry construction issue, it is beneficial to all three parties. Here, the prohibition of "private merchants," or the shrinking of the scope of power, and the politicization of the business nature - especially the issuance of commodity certificates or similar certificates to replace "cash" - are all practically necessary. However, whether today's international environment in China can be handled in this way is actually a problem in the present situation of open doors and the presence of many concessions. And whether the morality, personality, and ability of Chinese officials can overcome this task is another problem. Therefore, this method can only start from a small place and be tried out in rural or remote areas.</p>
<p>In terms of form, it is better to use cooperation than control, because control only has the government solely responsible, while cooperation requires the participation of the people. When I say this, I think back to the issue of planned economy.</p>
<p>In short, the solution to the consumption distribution issue depends on the joint efforts of the government and the people. As for the abolition of internal strife, the maintenance of long-term peace and order, especially the popularization and rapid effectiveness of disaster relief policies, these are still the prerequisites for the advancement of economic construction and the solution of the consumption distribution issue.</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more opinion to explain. That is, economic construction should be collectivized and communalized. Except for the state, no one is allowed to monopolize the production organs and social groups. The implementation of the distribution system should be individualized and universalized. Including government personnel, no one's material supply distribution can be excessively skewed and there can be no facts of unfair consumption. However, this is even more difficult in China. Understanding this, the implementation of government control policies with public means of production and average consumption methods is necessary, but it is too early to say so now.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Nan was disappointed, so she gave up the matter and shouted angrily, "Go away! You old bad thing;" So the poor ewe went alone, gently venting a complaint from her throat, indicating her fright and slight resentment.</p>
<p>"Everyone can take a sip, then we should go for a walk. If we don't walk, we'll fall asleep; lost people can't sleep. Don't you remember the interesting story of how Lee Hana died because she was sleepy under the snow?"</p>
<p>"But there's no snow here, and it's warm," said Robb, who did not have Nan's active imagination.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, we'll just peek around for a while; if no one comes again, we can hide in the bushes, like the brothers of "Tom Thumb" in fairy tales."</p>
<p>However, they could not walk for long, because Robb was already drowsy and unable to continue walking, and often fell to the ground, so Nan really couldn't stand it, and regretted it so much.</p>
<p>So she said, "If you fall again, I'm going to shake you hard," but as she said this, she gently picked up the poor little man, because Nan was like a barking dog, not necessarily going to bite.</p>

<p>In recent days, the financial market has been unusually sluggish, with no signs of prosperity. Yesterday was no exception, and it was even more deserted due to the weekend. The exchange rate remained unchanged due to the stability of the market, remaining at 8 cents in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, over 2.4 million yuan was transferred and over 300,000 yuan was newly traded. In the afternoon, there was no trading reported. The small general association traded over 400,000 yuan. Bank clearing was suspended as usual due to the weekend. Money shops cleared over 44.8 million yuan in foreign public loans and over 400,000 yuan in remittances from various sources. The market price of subsidiary currency remained unchanged for fractional currency, while copper coins were sold in large quantities by a certain firm, so the gray market price was only 3,050, with transactions made. In Guangzhou, 15,000 jiao were traded in the morning and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon, totaling 27,600 strings of copper coins, equivalent to 9,200 yuan in legal currency.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Securities: The Bond Market Still Fluctuating Over the Week <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>——Resulting in a Gain of Several Cents to One Yuan——</p>
<p>Last week, from December 2nd to 7th, the market situation on the China Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated quite erratically, not as directly up and down as before. The repeated price increases by the previous bullish companies have all collapsed on their own. After absorbing excessive amounts, they all feel satisfied, and the followers know that they cannot rely on it anymore, so they have also emerged one after another. Among them, the Jin Gang and a few major players sold the most and the most fiercely. This is the general situation of the market gradually turning from frenzy to moderation. The environmental situation seems to be slightly eased compared to the previous tension. The key now is whether the legal currency can circulate throughout the country, and whether the silver in the provinces can be concentrated in the government. When the bond market is in such an extremely turbulent time, it was fortunate to rely on the support of the long side before, but now the heat is gradually receding, going back and forth, so its turbulent situation is still not easy to calm down. The total number of transactions on the exchange is still around 100 million yuan, and it is especially difficult to make the bond market suddenly quiet due to the relationship between the two year-ends and the bank closing. Looking back on the past week, He's trip to the north on Monday, the bank still had a small amount of pull-up, and the Jin Gang had already emerged, and the market price rose from several cents to one yuan and a half. On Tuesday, He stopped in Baoding, the big players stopped pulling up, the North Gang and the Jin Gang continued to emerge, and the market price gradually turned, slightly chaotic, with highs and lows alternating, and the rise and fall were still seven or eight cents. On Wednesday, although He had arrived in Ping, the rumors of the five provinces did not stop, and the circulation of the legal currency raised another problem, and the big players gradually emerged, and the market price fell from a small number of cents to one yuan. On Thursday, the North China incident was still brewing, there were many rumors, and the North Gang's selling was strong again, slightly lower from one or two cents to six or seven cents. On Friday, No. 4 sold a huge amount, and various gangs also sold one after another, and No. 43, 46 and 54, etc., all bought in, and the market price returned to chaos, with highs and lows alternating, about three or four cents. On Saturday, the North China incident did not progress, and No. continued to sell, so the market was slightly scarce, but rose from several cents to yuan. As a result of the weekly market price, the gain was calculated from cents to yuan and four cents, and the total number of transactions was 161,855,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed in the table below for comparison (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened quietly, as the government report was to be released tomorrow. There were some southern hedging and long position liquidations, all of which were absorbed by counterparts and foreign merchants. There was no government selling. However, most counterparts are still waiting for the High Court's decision on the Agricultural Adjustment Act case. Later, the stock market was firm, and buying of the December contract increased, and the trend rebounded. Spot goods were sluggish, and prices were firm. The sales volume of textiles during the week was approximately equal to the production volume. As a result, spot goods remained unchanged, and futures rose by 1 to 3 pound coins. British cotton spot goods fell by 1 point, and futures fell by 2 points. European exporters and Japanese merchants slightly sold Indian cotton, which was met by short covering. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, Oumula fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by half a rupee. The original telegrams are recorded on the left (dated the 7th).</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total source from all gangs arrived at more than 50 numbers (more than 10,000 stones in total). Among them, thin rice accounted for half. Therefore, although the thin rice market continued to have Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other gangs handling more than 4,000 packages, the price still fell by 1 inch. As for thick early and other japonica rice, thanks to the cloudy and rainy weather and people's calmness, the market was stable.

<h3 id="e200">Talking About the Pen Industry <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— (Ning Ziqiang)</p>
<p>——We want to promote small industries——</p>
<p>The writing brush is an object for promoting domestic goods. The rise and fall of the brush industry is of great importance to the future of domestic goods. After the economic downturn enveloped the country, the common people after the disaster almost became fish in a dried-up ditch, and those in charge of the pen industry could not but be affected by it.</p>
<p>The raw materials for writing brushes are hemp and animal hair. Hemp is purchased from Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, costing at least 20 cents per pound. Animal hair is purchased from Xuzhou, with each basket weighing about 1.5 pounds and costing about 5 yuan. Brush handles are purchased from the southern Anhui area, costing about one copper coin per piece. Then, with the addition of labor, washing, brushing, and manufacturing, a skilled worker can produce 30 brushes per day, with a salary of about 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Based on this, the cost of labor and raw materials is so high that a writing brush cannot be profitable unless it costs 40 cents. However, since general purchasing power is now below the baseline, even if pen merchants sell at reduced prices, they still cannot sell, let alone maintain costs!</p>
<h3 id="e201">Firing Pottery <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Sheweng</p>
<p>Firing pottery is an industry that we invented long ago, along with papermaking, winemaking, etc. It has nothing to do with science or lack thereof, and it has already achieved considerable success. In a village, as long as someone advocates these small industries, there will be no idle people, no abandoned land, and the country will not have to worry about not being rich and strong.</p>
<p>The × village along the Yao River is backed by mountains and faces water, with very beautiful scenery. The villagers all make a living by burning pottery. They work at sunrise and rest at sunset, living their lives steadily. However, firstly, due to the nature of the soil, and secondly, due to adhering to old methods and not seeking progress, they can only burn some bricks and tiles, which are not as good as the products of Jingdezhen, Jiangxi. It is said that people in Fenghua can also make paper, but the products are not very good either; these are all the responsibilities of the local "intellectual class" and "propertied class"!</p>
<p>If the pottery kiln is not wide enough, Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan could not have lived there as a couple. Just taking the brick kiln as an example, it can probably fire 65,000 bricks per kiln. The capital is really small, probably requiring 50 to 60 yuan worth of pine firewood, which is enough, but labor accounts for most of it.</p>
<p>Digging up river mud, treading it with feet to make it tough, rotten and uniform, then putting the mud in a mold, drying it, dumping it out, and piling it in the kiln, then it can be fired. Pine firewood is put into the kiln door, and the raging fire melts and burns the entire kiln. After burning continuously for a day and night, iron wire mesh, rice straw, fine sand and other things are used to seal the kiln opening, and water is introduced from the kiln opening - according to insiders, 60 loads of water are required per kiln. - The water flows into the kiln and spreads like rain, so that the fired bricks gradually cool down. On the third day, when the kiln door is opened, it is still very warm inside, and the fired bricks are transported out, and they can be applied.</p>
<p>This is the most convenient old method of firing pottery kilns. Although it has not yet been eliminated, I think that the survival of the fittest is a natural law, and rapid improvement is necessary! This is not just about firing pottery kilns.</p>
<p>In the place where pottery kilns are fired, you can't find a single woman; because the kiln workers often work naked, naturally women avoid it. This is also a bad habit that should be eradicated.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Self-Spinning Wool Yarn <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Boge</p>
<p>There are so many unemployed people in society, and it is too cruel to just watch them suffer from the pain of freezing and starvation due to unemployment without thinking of ways to help them. Like modern China, it is precisely necessary to promote small industries, and the raw materials are best local products.</p>
<p>Wool yarn has a wide range of uses, and the raw material is sheep's wool, which everyone knows. In the past, wool yarn was all supplied by foreign countries, because we didn't know the secret of spinning wool yarn, but it is actually very easy.</p>
<p>The farmers in the Changxing (Zhejiang Province) area like to raise sheep the most, and almost every household raises ten or so sheep. In addition to farming for a living, the farmers here also engage in sericulture and raising sheep as side businesses, but silkworms are not raised in the summer and autumn seasons. The mulberry leaves are left to grow on the tree branches, and after a severe frost, they are picked and fed to the sheep. The sheep's dung and urine can also fertilize the fields, which is actually a very good method of circular production!</p>
<p>Sheep are very fertile, and every winter, many farmers are idle at home with nothing to do, so they lead their sheep to nearby towns and villages to do slaughtering and meat selling business. However, there is a lot of wool scraped off, and now they have learned the method of spinning yarn with wool, so recently rural women have been spinning yarn themselves. The method is to take a certain amount of wool and stone alkali shavings, add boiling water to soak, then rinse with clean water, dry in the sun, and dye it at will. The spinning procedure uses old-fashioned cotton spinning equipment. Although the method is very clumsy, it is a good way to promote local small industries for women to take this as a pastime when they have nothing to do, and I hope everyone will experiment with it!</p>

<h3 id="e203">Yixing Pottery <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>There is a very harsh saying in the area of Suzhou, called "Three coppers for a pair of Yixing chamber pots," meaning "only good at talking," describing people who can only talk but cannot do things. Although this saying has no deep meaning, "Yixing Pottery" does have a value worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The production centers of Yixing pottery are Shushan and Dingshan towns, located southeast of Yixing city. Shushan mainly produces teapots and teacups, while Dingshan produces a large number of bowls and dishes. However, this is not an absolute restriction, as Shushan kilns also manufacture and sell bowls and dishes, and Dingshan potters also make tea sets. It's just that these two areas have different main sales channels, hence this distinction.</p>
<p>Among the residents centered around Shushan and Dingshan, at least nine out of ten families rely on the pottery industry for a living. Although agriculture is also quite developed in these two areas, it is clearly in a secondary position. Children raised in the pottery area are able to mold various pottery prototypes around the age of ten. Indeed, the pottery industry in Yixing has a history of two thousand years, and the potters rely on the inexhaustible clay for their livelihood, which can be said to be a gift from nature.</p>
<p>From the Kangxi period until around the tenth year of the Republic of China, it was the golden age of Yixing pottery. It was not only popular throughout the country, but also welcomed everywhere in Japan and Southeast Asia. Even upper-class families in Europe and America had a set of Chinese-made Yixing tea sets or dish toys. During the early Republic of China and late Qing Dynasty, the average annual export value of pottery from Shushan and Dingshan was about two million to two and a half million yuan. However, in recent years, under the pressure of foreign porcelain, enamel, and glassware, it has gradually declined along with Jiangxi porcelain, heading towards an unfortunate fate.</p>
<p>It is said that the raw materials for Yixing pottery are only produced in Shushan and Dingshan, Yixing, within China's vast territory. It seems that no other country in the world produces the same fine clay as Yixing. Therefore, until now, no country has been able to imitate Yixing pottery. But now Yixing pottery is declining. It is said that some people are now promoting Jiangxi porcelain and improving it with scientific methods. Why is no one paying attention to this Yixing pottery, which has a long history and is unique in the world?</p>
<p>Finally, I remembered an Yixing friend who once asked me to compose a couplet, with the first line being "Wuxi Yixing clay teapot." The first character of the two place names were both transformed into verbs, very naturally, but I have thought about it for many years and have not been able to come up with a second line. Today, talking about Yixing pottery, I add this as a side note for amusement.</p>

<p>Episode Twenty-Two: Heroic Words Move Rosy Lips, Beauties Gather to Discuss; False Feelings Surprise Jade Wrists, Suffering Woman Escapes Captivity</p>
<p>Everyone in this universe seems to have two faces, one face for competing for fame, and one face for competing for profit. When these two faces are brought out at the same time, they often create great conflicts. The wife of the teacher next door to Cheng Zhiqian was the kind of person who brought out both faces at the same time. Wang Beihai listened blankly for a while, but couldn't help but feel anger rising in his heart, wishing he could jump over to the other room and slap the woman twice. Zhiqian smiled as he looked at his red face and didn't say anything. After a while, that Sister-in-law Hu came out of the room next door, seeming to be walking by with a smile on her face. Beihai really couldn't bear it any longer and, without informing Zhiqian first, got up and walked out. He went straight to the back courtyard entrance and blocked the passageway. Sister-in-law Hu was very familiar with his face, so she stopped and gave him a smile. Beihai's face was still red, and he calmed his breathing before smiling at Sister-in-law Hu: Sister-in-law, you can get another matchmaker's fee. Sister-in-law Hu took two steps back, leaned on the wall, and looked at him with a slight bite on her lip. She smiled and said: Listening to your husband speak, he's also a local. Am I that kind of person? Can't you tell? Beihai put both hands in his trouser pockets, then took them out again, rubbing them together a few times, and then smiled and said: How could I not know what kind of fire you are? I want to say something you won't like to hear: if it's your own relatives, you reluctantly introduce them to be sold, then what daughters of other people can you not introduce? Sister-in-law Hu was stunned by his words and couldn't say anything. Beihai saw that she was silent, so he glared at her and said: Let me tell you. Back when people were starving to death in Xi'an, the government didn't even allow people to be sold. Those who were sold went out secretly to escape for their lives. Now that the place is much more peaceful, poor people can find food to eat, as long as they're not lazy, there's always a way. If you continue to do this bone-selling business, I will definitely report you to the police. (373)</p>

<h3 id="e205">A Big Business with Small Capital <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Since this newspaper's National Goods Weekly published an article on rice straw papermaking, the number of letters received has been overwhelming. As for newspapers, there is already a government-business joint venture, the China Paper Manufacturing Company, dedicated to making them, and they will soon appear on the market. Our machines are too small and the capital is too large, so we don't need to bother with it. However, improving coarse paper is really a great path. In rural areas, specializing in pulp making can increase production by six times, which is definitely possible. However, selling to paper mills requires credit, and there is neither confidence nor strength, which is a problem. Therefore, I thought of the rice milling plant method. The pulp made in the rural areas can use our existing machines to help everyone make "improved coarse paper" to sell, which is easier to achieve success. There are 450 million people in China, and only those in swaddling clothes don't need paper. Whether male or female, old or young, rich or poor, it can be said that no one doesn't need paper every day. It's just a pity that hand-copied paper is too uneconomical because it consumes time, and the invested capital is not easily turned over, so the value is expensive and cannot compete with machine-made paper. Even in terms of coarse paper, the recent trend has been to use flushing water barrels. Residents in Shanghai and Qingdao have abandoned domestic coarse paper and switched to roll-type pit paper. However, because the price is not cheap, each roll can only be equivalent to one hundred sheets, costing more than ten cents. Therefore, the Hongkou pawnshops sell a kind of gray pit paper. It is made of oil paper, and the cost is half as cheap, so in the near future, Fuyang grass paper will undoubtedly be eliminated. The pit paper produced in Jiangxi, called Zhengxi, is even more expensive than Fuyang grass paper. How can it compete? Therefore, we must hurry up and improve it. It is impossible to switch to machine-made paper everywhere in the interior in a short time. Instead of just talking about it, it is better for everyone to take action and use a cooperative approach, which is easy and both parties can be bold without worry. Therefore, the simple methods are set as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All self-made pulp, whether it is rice straw or wheat straw pulp, or tree bark wood pulp, or ordinary bamboo pulp, does not need to be bleached or made into paper. Just soak it and dry it, making it into something like soybean cakes (in fact, it doesn't need to be dry, but the shipping cost will increase, which may not be cost-effective), and it can be sent to our factory for machine processing to make paper. The easiest to turn into money is "improved coarse paper." Each ton of material can be used to make eighty bundles of "Zhengxi" style pit paper (each bundle has twenty-two reams, and each ream has one hundred and ten sheets), with a labor cost of thirty-six yuan plus four yuan for miscellaneous expenses. Two years ago, the market price of "Zhengxi" was two yuan and six cents per piece. Because there is gray pit paper that is cheaper than it, the price has gradually fallen. Now it has fallen to one yuan and two cents per piece. Even the smaller "Xiaoxi" also sells for one yuan and one cent per piece. It is made by hand, one sheet at a time, and it is simply impossible to earn enough for food. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— (Qiao Yun Tun)</p>
<p>One day, I went for a walk in Jiangwan Town, and suddenly I discovered this miracle of a street cigarette factory. At first, I thought their raw materials must be those "cigarette butt picking" experts, who were their skirmish line-style tenants; (Note: Manufacturers send staff to various ports to buy raw materials, which is called "going out to the tenants.") After an interview, I found that they were a cut above. I also learned that these street cigarette factories take Jiangwan Town as their headquarters, calling it the main camp. They also have a machine, in the form of a fortune-telling stall. The machine, leaves, and cigarette paper are all sold by the cigarette shop. It is said that most of these cigarette shops are located in the Tangshan Road area of Hongkou. The stall is run by a man or a woman, but only by one person, so the title of "General Manager" is truly well-deserved. The engineer, manager, accountant, shop assistant, etc., can be called a "multifaceted individual." They mix the tobacco leaves, make the cigarettes, collect the payment from customers, and deliver the goods. When they encounter regular customers, they also give gifts. Buy a pack of cigarettes and get one cigarette free. They even exchange a few words of greeting: "Are you busy with your life?" "Is your business good?" With these two sentences, they really use their hands, mouth, ears, and eyes at the same time. They move the factory to the corner of the wall on hot days and to the sunny side on cold days. They say that they can produce hundreds of packs of cigarettes every day, half for retail and half for wholesale. The constant working capital is only three legal tender notes of one yuan each, which is more than enough.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Discussion on Blood Transfusion <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Saeki Shigeharu, translated by Zong Ze</p>
<p>Safe Operation Without Danger</p>
<p>—Blood is Still Effective After 25 Days of Storage—</p>
<p>Wide Range of Applications</p>
<p>The so-called blood transfusion is the act of taking as much blood as possible from the body of the blood donor, within the limit of the blood's ability to maintain its full function, and then transferring it to the blood vessels of the person who needs the blood, the recipient. This transfer of blood cannot be performed arbitrarily between people. If incompatible blood is transferred between them, the recipient often risks losing their life. Therefore, blood compatibility is very important in blood transfusion.</p>
<p>Blood Types: Blood can be broadly divided into two types: blood cells (formed components) and blood serum (liquid components). However, now most people separate blood cells and blood serum for observation. For example, if the blood cells of person A are mixed with the blood serum of person B, and the blood serum of person A is mixed with the blood cells of person B, then the phenomenon of agglutination reaction only occurs in the former and not in the latter. If the blood of another two people, B and C, are mixed, the reaction phenomenon does not occur in the former but occurs in the latter. If A and C are mixed, both reactions occur. If C and D are mixed, neither reaction occurs. The agglutination reaction phenomenon varies from person to person. More than ten years ago, several scholars, as a result of examining the agglutination reaction of many people, determined that human blood can be classified into four blood types. The names of these four blood types are O type, A type, B type, and AB type. Among them, even if the blood of people with the same type is mixed, no agglutination reaction occurs. Transfusing blood between people with the same blood type that does not cause a reaction will not cause any danger, as has been clearly understood through various experiences. It is now known that while blood of the same type is suitable for transfusion, it has also been found that transfusing blood between different types is not harmful, and it is also theoretically accepted that blood of type O can be transfused to people of other blood types (A, B, AB), and blood of type AB can also be transfused to people of other blood types (A, B, C).</p>
<p>Blood Donors: In addition to blood compatibility, the necessary condition for blood donors is that they be healthy. Blood that can cause viral infections due to blood transfusions is of course unacceptable. The most effective and appropriate blood is that of healthy and energetic adults. It is also best to avoid any impact on the blood donor during blood collection. Because the blood donor must have a large amount of blood taken, if the blood donor's blood pressure is very high, performing blood collection is not only harmless to the body, but can also eliminate its special state. Performing blood collection on weak and anemic people is very dangerous. From numerous experiences and experiments, it is known that a healthy person can have no more than 10 grams of blood taken per kilogram of body weight. If the body weight is 50 kilograms (about 13 catties), no more than 500 grams of blood can be taken. In this way, even continuous blood collection once a month will not harm the blood donor's body. Generally, the amount of blood required for blood transfusion ranges from 100 grams to 300 grams (up to 500 grams).</p>
<p>Purpose of Blood Transfusion: What kinds of diseases is this blood transfusion method applicable to? When we encounter injuries, duodenal ulcers, pulmonary tuberculosis, hemorrhoids, childbirth, ectopic pregnancy, etc., resulting in the patient having a large hemorrhage and facing a life-threatening situation, the first thing needed is blood supplementation. This is something that everyone can think of. Because after a sudden massive hemorrhage, the blood pressure drops sharply, and this drop in blood pressure can threaten the patient's own life. Therefore, before using surgery or focusing on hemostasis methods and planning other methods, the most important thing is to increase the patient's blood pressure. For this purpose, blood transfusion can be said to be the best method. Secondly, for anemia after massive hemorrhage, duodenal ulcers, stomach cancer, intestinal cancer, uterine cancer, uterine fibroids, hemorrhoids, pulmonary tuberculosis and other diseases, anemia caused by chronic bleeding, as well as infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, and various drug poisoning caused by toxins, as well as other types of anemia, and to thicken the blood in those with thin blood, blood transfusion methods can be used. In the case of chronic bleeding, it also has the meaning of hemostasis.</p>
<p>The blood that has been injected into the body has the effect of stimulating hematopoietic organs and promoting blood regeneration. For example, in patients with stomach cancer, judging from the course of the disease, removing the cancer is the radical cure. However, if the patient's physical strength is weak and they cannot undergo strong surgery, we usually use several blood transfusions to increase the patient's physical strength, and then perform major surgery to achieve the goal of curing the cancer. In addition, patients with hemophilia who bleed because their blood lacks coagulability and is temporarily difficult to stop, can also achieve considerable results if they frequently undergo blood transfusions, because the blood of healthy people contains the necessary substances for coagulating blood.</p>
<p>Blood transfusion can also be applied to acute infectious diseases such as sepsis, acute peritonitis, acute osteomyelitis, cellulitis, erysipelas, intestinal typhus, dysentery, etc., because these diseases are caused by toxins destroying a large number of red blood cells in the human body. By using blood transfusion methods, the deficiency of red blood cells can be supplemented, and at the same time, toxins existing in the body can be destroyed and the number of bacteria in the blood can be reduced. A method that further enhances its effectiveness for the purpose of antitoxin and antibacterial is called immune blood transfusion. For example, by adopting the blood of patients in the recovery period who have the same disease course as the patient for blood transfusion, or by proactively administering immunization injections to the blood donor, their immunity can be increased, because the blood of people in the recovery period contains a large amount of immune substances. In addition, blood transfusion can also be effective for burns, eclampsia, carbuncle, carbon gas poisoning, mushroom poisoning, and various other drug poisonings. When dealing with patients with infectious diseases or poisoning, they can first have blood let (blood must be prepared in advance), and then administer blood transfusion, which is even more effective - and on the other hand, we want to talk about the danger of blood transfusion.</p>
<p>Side Effects of Blood Transfusion: If the selection of blood is not wrong and the blood transfusion method is proper, death directly caused by blood transfusion can be said to be extremely rare. However, it cannot be said that there are no side effects at all. Including the very mild ones, about 20% of people experience some kind of side effect. Lighter symptoms include fatigue, chills, hot flashes, fever, headache, palpitations, dizziness, urticaria.</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>rash, mild abdominal pain, etc. Severe symptoms include chills, shivering, high fever, nausea, vomiting, severe back pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, poor pulse, delirium, etc. Although such situations may cause extreme panic among the people around, most of them are temporary phenomena. After twelve hours (at most several hours), the patient can return to their previous state. Although the cause of these side effects has been clarified after much research, even if there are no shortcomings in the operation, such situations often occur, and encountering such situations to a certain degree is dangerous. Therefore, blood transfusion is not something that anyone can perform. It must be implemented after careful consideration of each individual's situation.</p>
<p>Blood Transfusion Methods: There are two methods of blood transfusion: (1) Directly transfusing the collected blood to the recipient without adding any substances—direct method. (2) Adding citric acid soda to the collected blood to remove its blood clotting properties before infusing it—indirect method. If a suitable blood is found for the direct method, it is theoretically very appropriate to deliver it to the recipient in its original composition, and in practice, there are very few side effects. However, due to various operational inconveniences, it is not widely used. The indirect method is more successful because it can prevent blood clotting, and its effect is not much different from the direct method. Therefore, most people currently use this method. In addition, blood with citric acid soda can be stored in a refrigerator for about ten periods, and it is possible to transport it to a distant place for blood transfusion. Regarding the storage period of blood, blood stored for up to 25 days still has considerable effect. This is the result of recent research.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the blood is once turned into dry powder, it can be dissolved into a liquid before use and then infused. This is the so-called dry blood transfusion method. Although this is slightly different from the true meaning of blood transfusion, it can at least achieve part of the purpose of blood transfusion.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Question) What is schistosomiasis?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is a disease caused by a type of fluke that parasitizes in the blood vessels of the portal vein of the human liver. It is specifically called Japanese schistosomiasis because it was prevalent in several places in Japan. Recently, this parasitic disease has also been found in several places in our country.</p>
<p>(Question) How do these flukes invade the human body?</p>
<p>(Answer) They penetrate the human body through the skin or are ingested through drinking water.</p>
<p>(Question) Where do blood flukes parasitize before invading the human body?</p>
<p>(Answer) Their intermediate host is a type of snail.</p>
<p>(Question) How big are blood flukes?</p>
<p>(Answer) Male worms are about 15 to 16 millimeters long (equivalent to 0.4 to 0.5 inches), and female worms are about 19 to 21 millimeters long (equivalent to 0.6 to 0.7 inches), but the female worms are much thinner than the male worms.</p>
<p>(Question) What effects do blood flukes have on the organs of a person with schistosomiasis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The human organ directly affected is the liver. The liver initially swells and then shrinks and hardens. The surface develops small hill-like protrusions and depressions. Sometimes, because the worm eggs travel through the large veins to the lungs, the lungs also undergo the same changes as the liver. Other organs, such as the spleen, also swell, and the mucous membranes of the large and small intestines become inflamed and swollen, or develop small ulcers.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of a person with schistosomiasis?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are two types of symptoms of schistosomiasis: acute and chronic.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of the acute type?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is localized itchy dermatitis, especially common in the lower limbs. About two weeks after infection, initial symptoms include general fatigue, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain; after three weeks, due to the worms laying eggs in the portal vein branches of the intestinal wall, acute enteritis or appendicitis-like symptoms develop, sometimes with fever and liver swelling.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of the chronic type?</p>
<p>(Answer) Some develop from repeated acute attacks, while others are chronic from the beginning. The liver gradually swells and hardens, becoming tender to the touch. As the disease progresses, the liver shrinks, and various sizes of granules can be felt on its surface. At the same time, there are symptoms such as anemia and digestive disorders, stomach pain, abdominal distension, palpitations, and difficulty breathing, sometimes with edema, ascites, or jaundice, and gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>
<p>(Question) How can a diagnosis be made to confirm schistosomiasis?</p>
<p>(Answer) If liver enlargement, mucosal bleeding, and portal vein congestion are encountered in an endemic area, this disease can be considered. It is even more certain to prove the presence of worm eggs in the stool.</p>
<p>(Question) Which diseases should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>(Answer) It should be distinguished from Banti's disease and Laennec's cirrhosis.</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 66) How many types of systemic contributing factors are there?</p>
<p>(Answer) Systemic contributing factors can be divided into two categories: congenital and acquired. Congenital factors are related to heredity and are beyond one's control. For example, if parents are physically weak, have low resistance, or have unhealthy teeth, their children's teeth will also be weak, have no resistance, and be very prone to cavities. Acquired factors can be said to include any lifestyle abnormality that can reduce the body's resistance, which can induce cavities. In particular, the following reasons are even more significant: (1) Nutritional disorders, physical weakness, leading to decalcification. (2) Insufficient nutrients in the diet, lack of phosphorus, calcium, vitamins, etc. (3) Suffering from lung disease, venereal disease, typhoid fever, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, etc. (4) Saliva changes, losing its alkalinity, unable to neutralize lactic acid and prevent the development of bacteria. (5) Loss of calcium during pregnancy.</p>
<p>(Question 67) Which part of the tooth is most prone to cavities?</p>
<p>(Answer) Any concave area on the surface of the tooth, and areas where the enamel is incompletely developed, such as the grooves on the occlusal surface of molars, and concave lines and small pits on other surfaces, are most prone to cavities. Also, the gaps between two adjacent teeth, and the area around the neck of the tooth near the gums, are also very prone to cavities; because these areas are not easily reached by friction, brushing is difficult, and food is most likely to linger. Also, upper incisors are more prone to cavities than lower incisors. This is because the lower incisors are located where the sublingual glands secrete, and can receive more protection from saliva.</p>
<p>(Question 68) How do cavities progress?</p>
<p>(Answer) The surface of the enamel, where it is eroded by lactic acid, dissolves the colloid, first becoming rough. The erosion gradually deepens, forming small holes. Then food and bacteria are more likely to stay, and the erosion is faster. When the cavity penetrates the enamel and reaches the dentin, it is like breaking a bamboo. This is because the dentin softens when it encounters acid, and the softened dentin allows bacteria to penetrate, fermenting inside the dentin and encountering the action of acid. Bacteria and acid collude, so the erosion is extremely fast, eventually penetrating the pulp chamber and killing the dental pulp.</p>
<p>(Question 69) When does tooth decay cause pain?</p>
<p>(Answer) When the decay reaches the dentin, there will be a feeling of soreness. Especially when stimulated by cold, heat, or acidic substances. When the decay is close to the dental pulp, severe pain often occurs.</p>
<p>(Question 70) What pulp diseases can cavities cause?</p>
<p>(Answer) The earliest is pulp hyperemia, then pulpitis, and finally pulp necrosis.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the degree of danger of this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) The acute type is mostly good, and it can be completely cured after a few weeks to two or three months. The chronic type can last for twenty or thirty years, and death occurs due to general weakness.</p>
<p>(Question) How to treat it?</p>
<p>(Answer) Only administering a combination of quinine and tartar emetic or injecting Salvarsan.</p>

<p>(72) Foreign Objects in the Nose</p>
<p>Foreign objects in the nose are common, especially in young children. Clinically, it is often encountered. Now I will briefly talk about the types of foreign objects and the symptoms they cause. Types of foreign objects = Young children mostly use slate pencils, chalk, and erasers, or play with buttons, chess pieces, and beans. Therefore, the types of foreign objects mostly belong to these types. The chance of foreign objects entering is usually due to automatic insertion into the nose. Rarely passive intrusion.</p>
<p>Symptoms caused by foreign objects = After a foreign object is inserted into the nose, if it can be discovered immediately and taken out by a doctor, no symptoms should occur. If it is not discovered and taken out after a day or two, the nasal cavity will suddenly overflow with nasal fluid. The nasal fluid is initially a thin mucus: then it becomes purulent and has an odor. At the same time, the nasal cavity feels blocked (if the foreign object is a bean, it can swell when it encounters nasal fluid, and the nasal obstruction will also increase accordingly). At this time, the parents of the child often think that the child has a nasal tumor or cerebrospinal fluid leak. The child often forgets the process of inserting the foreign object. Only after the doctor's examination can the existence of the foreign object be discovered. Facts of this kind are often encountered clinically. The author recently encountered a case. It was a five-year-old boy. His symptom was that the bridge of his nose was particularly swollen. A yellowish-green purulent secretion flowed out of his nose. The nasal cavity on the affected side was completely blocked. This situation lasted for about four months. The parents thought that the child had a tumor in the nasal cavity. However, the examination revealed a small piece of green eraser. The outside of the eraser was stained with purulent secretions. The mucous membrane of the nasal cavity was also swollen and eroded. Therefore, as parents, if you encounter a child with unilateral nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, you should immediately pay attention to whether there is a foreign object in the child's nose. If there is any doubt, you should immediately seek medical attention to examine the nasal cavity. It should not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Also, when there is a foreign object in the nose, families often try to remove it themselves. If the method is not appropriate, it is easy to push it into the back of the nasal cavity, which causes fear, thinking that it can invade the brain. In fact, foreign objects can pass from the back of the nasal cavity, through the nasopharynx, and reach the oral cavity. So, there is no need to panic.</p>
<p>The treatment method for foreign objects in the nose is to determine the foreign object and then use appropriate instruments to remove it, and it will be cured.</p>

<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>Every day when I open the local news, "abduction," "seduction," "abandonment"... such scandals and troubles occur several times a day. And the statistics of weekly criminal events of university students committing fraud and becoming thieves, and even municipal authorities and the Public Works Department, etc.: cases of stealing, theft, kidnapping, and robbery are increasing rather than decreasing, which tells us about the social pathology of today—can't you see it? The recent news that the Jiangsu No. 2 Prison in Caohejing is overcrowded and will carry out a large-scale parole of old prisoners of up to six or seven hundred people is a very real reflection!</p>
<p>The news also reported that a young robber who had received higher education was sentenced to ten years in prison. It is said that this young man is proficient in several languages and has received higher education. He is from Shandong Province, 24 years old. He was sentenced to six years in prison for carrying weapons and robbing in a group of three or more people, seven years in prison for attempted murder, and seven years of deprivation of political rights. He should serve ten years in prison and seven years of deprivation of political rights.</p>
<p>It seems rare to hear about this kind of "knowledge robber" who is proficient in several languages and has received higher education, right? I remember a few months ago, when a college student became a thief, it attracted the attention of the general public and the media, and a review of the employment, unemployment, and even the entire future of young people was made. But here, I don't know what else to say?</p>
<p>Originally, "the future of young people" is not a simple problem, and the fact that "intellectuals" want to commit robbery is not accidental. Everyone can see it, right? In recent years, with the social depression—rural bankruptcy, market depression, economic depression in all industries—the general working people are struggling in the face of hunger and death under heavy oppression, and the general petty bourgeoisie is also inevitably declining; at the same time, a large number of "intellectuals" are unable to find a way out and are down and out... all of these are undeniable facts.</p>
<p>However, the fact that "intellectuals" commit theft is not just starting today. The smuggling of antiques by a certain important person, the private sale of public power by a certain politician, and the bribery and secret plunder of corrupt officials have all become open secrets.</p>
<p>Originally, our society has been evolving in such a complex and chaotic way. How should we see through and recognize these facts and make effective preparations!</p>

<p>Untitled</p>
<p>Under the lamp, listening to the autumn wind gently tapping the window with raindrops, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, the bleak autumn feeling can't bear the loneliness and is sobbing. The past is surging in my heart like a tide.</p>
<p>But, the past can only add to sorrow. The more I think, the more chaotic it becomes. I want to cut it off, but I can't...</p>
<p>Yes, what I fear most when I am idle is thinking about the past. I don't know why, the old memories are always so beautiful, but the situation in front of me is always</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>so cursed.</p>
<p>I once compared this old temper to a devil. That guy is terrible! When I'm happy, it disappears without a trace; but when troubles come, it makes me even more dizzy.</p>
<p>I was angry. I used the most cruel words to scold my nerves, questioning why it allowed these ghosts to fight and occupy my brain.</p>
<p>——Be quiet! The sea can't rise waves without wind.</p>
<p>In confusion, it seemed that a soft voice was saying softly.</p>
<p>So, I stood up and turned off the lights.</p>
<p>The night is quiet.</p>
<p>In order to avoid troubles, I closed my eyes, rested my head on the window frame, and silently listened to the sound of rain sobbing in the night wind...</p>
<h3 id="e214">Sending to a Distant Old Friend <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The small building is immersed in the sound of rain again tonight.</p>
<p>Thinking of you on a distant southern island, I am lost again. It's not because I'm sighing at the rapid passage of days; my friend, think about it, it's really those past memories that are too worthy of nostalgia. At that time, I didn't know what autumn depression was, what winter horror was; I only knew spring, spring, every day was spring.</p>
<p>So, after you left, I began to learn to be silent.</p>
<p>"Learn slowly, from silence, you will understand why life is. Gradually, gradually, you will understand that there is nothing to pursue in the world."</p>
<p>That friend in his thirties who had recently become a widower, one day when he discovered that I was staring at your photo, he said to me affectionately.</p>
<p>The reason I became silent is based on this.</p>
<p>But, whenever I am alone and trapped in boredom, I feel that neither the left nor the right is right, and I will overturn the reason for this silence. ——I am not a lark, why should I lock myself in a cage? Moreover, even if it is a lark, it will not lock itself up.</p>
<p>For this reason, there was a time when I often strolled in the autumn countryside every evening. Therefore, I got used to the curling smoke rising from the distant gardens, and I was also familiar with the melancholy face of the setting sun in the west. Until the twilight dyed the surroundings with a gray color reminiscent of an ancient tomb, I dragged my heavy steps back.</p>
<p>Maybe you will say; "Why so melancholy?" No,... I only hope to have a chance to break this oppressive cage and let the lark fly out freely.</p>
<p>So, I opened the window. Let the cold night wind wake up my confused nerves, let the raindrops gently caress my face, my hair...</p>
<p>Oh, my friend, will spring also, like me, come again after a short period of silence?</p>
<p>"There is no reason why it can't exist."——You might answer like this.</p>
<p>Yes, my friend, it will come. But, you have to remember: "Without you, I have no spring."</p>
<p>Because of this reason, I can't say anything else.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Song of the Eagle (Continued) <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>Silence is terrible pain. Occasionally raising our heads, four eyes looking at four eyes: fixed, without light, cracking a bitter smile, and lowering our heads again.</p>
<p>A goshawk swept across the sky, stretching its two powerful wings, flying from here to there, from there to here, flying so majestic and freely. Its head and neck stretched forward, and from its hard beak, it sang a clear and crisp song, like a horn, piercing our ears sharply, piercing our throbbing hearts. We heard a friend's song in our ears:</p>
<p>"I love to see the goshawk flying in the sky, and I love to hear its clear song! Young friends, don't forget: what it tells us!"</p>
<p>Hot blood was boiling, and the four of us jumped up, forgetting the tragedy we had just witnessed. We turned away from the gray color brought by the tragedy, we jumped excitedly, we raised our heads, facing the free and majestic goshawk, we echoed with rough voices, we sang:</p>
<p>"We love to see the goshawk flying in the sky, we love to hear its clear song! We have not forgotten what it tells us!"</p>
<p>We began to fly, learning to fly in the sky like a goshawk, learning to fly like our dear friend. Our boiling hot blood was encouraging ourselves, for our own rights.</p>
<p>The south is a ball of fire, we flew with this flame, from here to there, and from there to there. We are all young, we all have a pair of strong arms and a pair of strong legs, and the goshawk also has a pair of strong wings. We are like eagles, flying like eagles, flying freely: flying to whatever place. We also have a voice, shouting out the clear song roughly, the same song as the goshawk. We love to hear this song, and we also love to sing this song.</p>
<p>So, we forgot the depression, and we also tore down the gray curtain of the tragedy, although it was still the dark night before the sun came out, we were flying so excitedly.—We sang the Song of the Eagle for the first time in a loud voice.</p>
<p>At this time, we remembered our friend who had been separated for a long time, the friend who was flying like an eagle, we silently recited his song, and silently prayed for his health. We were not ashamed, we just used the facts to tell him: we did not forget him for a moment.</p>
<p>Now, it is such a dark night again. A gray curtain covered my eyes again, and I was dropped into the fence of silence again. I raised my head, and in the sky I saw the goshawk flying again, and the clear song boiled my hot blood again. So I straightened my chest, stretched my neck, and sang the Song of the Eagle:</p>
<p>(...We have not forgotten what he told us!)! (End)</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Preference for Green and Blue <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Meng</p>
<p>Among all the natural colors, what I love most is green, followed by blue, which is close to green. People's preference for colors is more emotional than rational; it is better to say that it is intuitive than explainable. Therefore, I don't want to explain my preference for green or blue. If I have to say something, it may be based on my love of nature.</p>
<p>In the house, I love green decorations. I love to paste green paper on the walls, love to wrap my cherished books in green paper covers; make green cloth into tablecloths, and also make green cushions into chair cushions. For other utensils, whenever possible, I always like to choose green ones to use. I decorate the house with a green theme, and then sit in it alone, smoking a cigarette leisurely. Whether dreaming, thinking, reading, or writing, I feel warm and harmonious, and my spirit is refreshed. Otherwise, if the room is changed to a red, dark yellow, light gray, or other colorful or dark colors, my spirit will not be able to concentrate, and my nerves will be disturbed.</p>
<p>Lying in a green room at night, the sleepiness is thick and sweet. When I am about to fall asleep, I glimpse the green luster around me, projecting on the corners of my eyes, directly piercing my heart. My heart seems to be ironed, and I feel unusually comfortable, so I can sleep peacefully. When I wake up, open my sleepy eyes, and glimpse the blurred green in the room, I will joyfully rub my eyes, yawn, and climb up happily. It is said that the green color in the bedroom is most suitable for sleep. I don't know the reason, but based on my intuition, I do feel that the gentleness of green is most helpful for sound sleep, and even dreaming is sweet.</p>
<p>Based on my love for green, I love to stand by the window and look out. Watching the green forest in the village and the blue sky is most likely to stimulate my imagination. I often stand by the window for several hours, letting the wings of imagination fly on the green treetops and in the blue sky, until I am immersed in a state of almost ignorance and unconsciousness. Maeterlinck's "The Blue Bird" was particularly loved in my youth. Now that I think about it, the reason seems not accidental, right?</p>
<p>Because I love green, I love to climb high mountains and travel. Because only on high mountains can I see a wider green field; only in travel can I broaden my horizons. I can see the fresh colors of the green fields in different places and smell the fragrance of the green forest. I have climbed quite a few high mountains, although not many. Although the scenery in each place is different, and the tastes are different, the same glimpse of the green forest, the sight of the green field, and the look up at the vast blue sky are equally satisfying. On high mountains, the endless green of the green forest and grass, and the green color of the villages and fields are clear at a glance. As for the vast and distant sky, it cannot be seen by living in a narrow room, right?</p>
<p>From the carriages or ships of travel, you can also see the green fields and plants, and the sky hanging high above the blue river and sea. Trains or pleasure boats, because of long-distance travel, pass through countless mountains, fields, dense forests, and swamps. From here, I can expand my vision as much as possible and capture all the green luster along the way. As for the ship in the sea, the sky and the sea are both a vast blue, at that time, except for the rare white clouds and the rainbow on the horizon, almost all of them are a blue color. Then the sea's love for me is needless to say.</p>
<p>Therefore, I love the ocean more than the land, love the high mountains more than the plains, love the countryside more than the city, love the rivers more than the wilderness, and love the wilderness more than the room. Based on my preference for colors, my temperament and worldview have been completely determined. The influence of colors on me can be said to be very large.</p>
<p>Red is more stimulating, gray is more sentimental, yellow makes people feel turbid, black makes people sad, I still love peaceful and gentle green, and imaginative blue!</p>
<h3 id="e217">Narcissus <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>My father was a man who deeply loved nature, so his fondness for flowers and plants was a given. However, whether his lack of a singular passion made him a step below Tao Yuanming is debatable. Still, he bought narcissus every year. When he did, I felt that the New Year was approaching, because it was only available in winter and was used to decorate homes at the end and beginning of the year. Though narcissus doesn't bloom in a riot of reds and greens, its long green leaves give rise to white petals with yellow hearts, creating a magnificent display that inspires nothing but pure thoughts. When in full bloom, it also emits a faint, elegant fragrance. Paired with white pebbles in an antique pot, it exudes grandeur and spirit. If I had to use two words to describe narcissus, “refined charm” would encompass all its qualities.</p>
<p>When spring was about to sprout, the narcissus would wither. Some suggested hanging the bulbs under the eaves to prevent them from rotting and decaying, saying they would be useful next year, and that dried narcissus, like “three-year-old moxa,” could cure ailments. However, we always discarded them. Once, my brother tried the method, but they didn't grow or bloom. Perhaps his technique was not refined enough, and he never bothered with it again. I've seen my father buy narcissus more than just once or twice. His state of mind changed every year, and changed rapidly. During that time, my father also seemed to age.</p>
<p>There was a time when I didn't see my father for two years. I don't know if he bought narcissus or not. This year, I saw my father bring narcissus home again, but he had added a layer of colorful stones from Nanjing's Yuhuatai on top of the white pebbles, giving it a fresh look. The narcissus was as beautiful as ever, while I was growing older year by year, and my father had aged even more. Why couldn't he have the same spirit as the narcissus every year? I don't know if I will be able to see my father buy narcissus again next year, and see it bloom once more with its white petals and yellow hearts. White pebbles covered with colorful stones from Yuhuatai, paired with an antique pot and placed on a redwood stand, were displayed beneath several painted screens, highlighting the narcissus’s refined charm.</p>
<p>A local superstition says that the prosperity of a family is tied to the flourishing or decline of flowers. At the end of the year, people want everything to be auspicious, so naturally, they would divine the fate of the family based on the state of the narcissus. However, my own observation, albeit based on superstition, suggests otherwise. The two narcissus plants in my home flourished or withered depending on their location. The true needs of narcissus are water and sunlight. A narcissus deprived of water and sunlight will wither and die. Yet, dark clouds often obscure the sun. If we are also receiving the blessings of water and sunlight, then we, too, should have the same spirit as the narcissus.</p>
<p>In a north-facing room, there is a pot of narcissus, suffering the unfortunate fate of not being touched by sunlight. Gradually, it withered and turned yellow. Thinking of my own situation, I should put that pot of narcissus in the sun so it can be free from the suffering of neglect and burst forth with a few charming blooms.</p>

<p>"Peach Blossom Dream" is the first great product of Dan Duyu after changing his style. It took eight months of filming to complete. The play contains two major parts: the natural beauty of the countryside and the prosperity of the city. The actions of the characters in the play also change with the environment. Those who are not naturally talented in art cannot fulfill this role well. Led by Yin Mingzhu, the remaining cast members such as Cang Yin, Qiu Lei, Meng Na, as well as singers and dancers such as Xu Can Ying and Bao Xi Xi, all have profound performances. Those who have seen its preview say that the scene can be compared to "A Poet's Journey to Hell", and the skill surpasses it. It will be released at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater in this city soon, and movie fans will surely be eager to see it first.</p>

<p>Sets New Sales Record in America</p>
<p>"The Count of Monte Cristo" starring Robert Donat, and Marlene Carroll, the female lead in "Scarlet Empress" and "The Hated Wife of King Henry", co-star in "The 39 Steps". When the film was released at the Roxy Theatre in New York, the sales were so high that it broke the "earth-shattering" sales record that had not been broken for six years. The entire American film industry was shaken, and it was praised as Britain's unprecedented world masterpiece. The content of the film, whether in terms of plot, performance, or photography, is indeed outstanding in every aspect. This film has already arrived in Shanghai, and it is said that it will soon be released at the Great Light Cinema. This is indeed a piece of news worth reporting to all Shanghai movie fans.</p>

<p>Wu Cun's works often have a subtle sense of humor, which is amusing without being over the top. He can express the essence of a tragedy with comedic techniques, making the audience often let out a humorous wry smile in a helplessly depressing environment. In his new work "Flower of Spring", in addition to the usual urban night scenes, snowy streets, flowing ice rivers, palace-style dance halls, and other beautiful scenes, the insertions of film company productions, military camp life, and so on, are all in a relaxed tone. In the witty dialogue, a kind of meaning that makes people smile knowingly is conveyed in a roundabout way. Recently, the interior scenes are being actively filmed, and in the near future, he will be traveling to the northern country to shoot exterior scenes!</p>
<h3 id="e227">Silver Miscellaneous Notes <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" truly makes people feel like they have had a wonderful dream after watching it. Of course, its social value now is just like a "dream".</p>
<p>After watching "A Midsummer Night's Dream", I have a few thoughts: First, the progress of photography techniques, like smoke and dreams, is extremely beautiful; second, the compactness of the scene transitions and the director's agility in technique. Especially the second point makes people believe that with a good script (just talking about the production) and a good director, even without good actors, the play will not fail.</p>
<p>"A Midsummer Night's Dream" will be screened at the Great Light after the Cathay, and the seat prices will not increase.</p>
<p>"Hero of the Times" had a public preview at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater yesterday. According to those who have seen it, Shang Guan Wu's acting is indeed very good.</p>
<p>"Camera" writes: After calculating, only Ren Gong Jin Ping can be called a "hero of the times" in the film industry. If not for the "situation" of Rehua... how could there be this "hero" Ren Gong.</p>
<p>"King of Blockbusters" Tianlun has the advertisement of "International Premiere" at the Great Light in yesterday's Shen Bao, but there is no date because the Great Light has not scheduled it yet. The screening period is two days.</p>
<p>Lianhua and Jincheng signed a contract, so Jincheng sued the court, and Jincheng lost the case. It is said that in the contract, Lianhua gives Jincheng twenty-four films every year, including six blockbusters, and two of them can be given to the Great Light for screening. Lianhua only produced six films this year, and Tianlun was one of them, going to the Great Light. Jincheng's reason is like this.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that Tianlun was originally scheduled to be released at the Jincheng on Double Ten Festival, but was taken away by the electric power's urban scenery. Jincheng borrowed three thousand gold from Lianhua, and negotiated to schedule Tianlun for the next holiday.</p>
<p>Now I don't know if "International Premiere" will be followed by a continued screening at Jincheng?</p>
