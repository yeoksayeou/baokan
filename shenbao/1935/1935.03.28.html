<h3>日本退出國聯生效</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>日本自一九三三年三月二十七日宣告退出國聯至昨日爲止其退盟後應履行條約義務之二年期間業已屆滿根據國聯盟約自今以後日本無論在法律上實際上均完全與國聯無關換言之卽日本在東亞之一切行動更非國聯所能過問矣</p>
<p>國聯爲一空虛散漫之組織其力量旣不能制止九一八以來遠東局面之惡化則日本之退出其與我國所生之影響亦甚有限吾人於此不願多所論列茲僅就二年來東亞大勢之變遷一言之</p>
<p>方日本宣吿退出國聯之始世人以爲根據條約之道義制裁旣失其最後之效能一切保持旣得實益之國際條約亦隨之動搖國際形勢頗爲嚴重日本亦自知其此舉實冒天下之大不韙故當退盟以前經再三之研究及至退盟書發表以後態度力示溫和唯恐列國採一致之步驟以相應付</p>
<p>廣田就外相任後尤以全力打破孤立外交之形勢對華政策暫取靜觀對歐美外交則力避衝突同時且更以經濟政策之運用冀輔外交之不足二年以來日本外交固無時不居於有利地位也若就其積極方面言則獨佔東亞之四一七聲明昂然發表國防平等權之要求相繼提出各國對之除相顧失色羣起作造艦之競爭外其他有效之應付方法殊無所聞蓋國際之環境愈複雜日本外交之縱橫技倆更可乘機運用往事如新不難覆按也</p>
<p>現日本旣已完全脫離國聯之關係矣國聯盟約以外之國際條約如九國公約者已無復有約束之能力如華盛頓海軍條約業已被聲言廢棄而日本之所表示如對南太平洋委任統治諸島聲明决不歸還國聯獨佔東亞之態度更不願有絲毫之改變日本爲所欲爲使東亞形勢加深其緊張程度此吾人於日本退出國聯完全生效之今日所應深切認識者也</p>
<p>雖然現實之東亞形勢縱極複雜吾人亦殊無須悲觀日本雖已完全不受國聯盟約之羈絆决不能處於超然之形勢而獨居而東亞獨佔之地位更非輕易之勢力所能造成吾人今後惟有羣策羣力以求得民族之自力生存不自餒不以外力爲可恃不以險惡之環境爲足慮舉國上下淬礪奮發以圖自存此又吾人於深切認識之餘所當努力者也</p>
<h3>有吉下月返日　四月中旬召集駐華領事會議　作綜合的對華意見返日進言</h3>
<p>（東京）據外務省息、該省已發出命令、飭令駐華公使有吉明氏、於四月下旬返日、詳細報吿、中國事情、而樹立對華具體政策、外務省又命有吉公使於四月中旬在滬召集駐華各地日領、開領事會議、藉以知悉各地情形、聽取各領事之意見、期得統盤之意見帶京向外務省作重要進言云、（二十七日華聯社電）</p>
<h3>日本海軍表示　決以實力反持代管島　美國對此最近亦不致提此問題　認日脫離國聯於政局上無影響</h3>
<p>（東京）日本於本日完全脫離國際聯盟、日本海軍對南洋委任統治羣島之態度、仍確固不動、蓋以南洋委任統治羣島係歐洲大戰中日本海軍所佔領、乃戰勝之結果、且與友邦協議之後始歸日本統治之下、故絕對不能放棄、亦無放棄之理由、若敵國以南洋羣島之一角爲根據、漸次伸其毒手於日本本土方面、則面太平洋之全海軍將由側背面受敵、縱令海軍力優於敵人、尙難期海防之安全、况兵力劣於敵人、當更感困難、故萬一附以何等之理由、謀由日本奪取南洋羣島、則日本對策非常簡單、換言之、卽以實力應付之而已、（二十七日電通電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本今日已與國聯正式脫離關係、在政治上大槪將無影響、此間高級方面以爲日本此舉係表示其更加趨於國家主義、對於美國有關係者祗太平洋代管島問題、惟可靠方面認此問題在目前無關重要、美國雖亦要求對於舊屬德國各島有處分之權、然美國未必堅持此種權利、故自各方面觀之、日本代管島問題、美國最近當不致提起、此間皆以爲日本之退出國聯、可以象徵其對於本身之海陸軍實力、已深信足以應付他國、故其行勤亦更爲單獨、最近日本之廢止華盛頓條約及其所主張之亞洲門羅主義、皆爲相同之傾向、觀察者雖認此種政策未必卽致改變近年來太平洋之和平空氣、然至少已增加不穩成份、官塲方面表示、對於遠東問題、仍將與日本合作、尤以海軍問題及中國之門戶開放政策爲甚、美國本身雖亦非國聯會員、然已漸漸採取國際合作政策、日本則適背道而馳、例如菲律濱欲優待美貨、國務院表示反對、此間卽以爲係美國不欲引起日本惡感之表示、商界方面亦屢屢主張日本市塲對於美國甚爲重要云、（二十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參院外交委員會主席畢特門今日發言評論日本退出國聯自明日發生效力事曰、國聯生命又受一致命打擊矣、參議員波拉曰、余對於日本退出國聯、並不驚異、蓋任何大國其利益與國聯相牴觸者、從未尊重國聯也、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日社論謂一大國因未履行國聯之决議、乃不復爲國聯會員、此種事件、首於日本之退出國聯見之、旣不復爲國聯會員、而仍參加國聯工作、不受國聯義務之束縛、此事是否相宜、現已引起疑問、所可無疑者、將來或成立一種妥協、而在國聯供獻於南京之非政治的服務中保持日本之合作、日本當知國聯之機械、苟無國家財庫所供給之燃料、則不能工作也云、每日電聞謂日本所提出國聯行政範圍應加入移民法之前案、爲國聯拒絕後、日本在國聯之意義卽已减少、迨日本遠東政策爲人抨擊時、日本乃振振有詞、曰「徘斥日僑、旣爲他國之内部政策、非國聯所能過問、則日本爲人民過剩謀取出路之行爲、何以不亦視爲日本私人事件、非國聯所可過問乎」云、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日本退出國聯今日生效、法國對之最爲痛惜、其原因有二、第一、法國對日向表同情、第二、法國向來之政策在於維持國聯威信、故法國政治家對於日本二年前宣吿退出、咸感國聯已受重大打擊、而德國之接踵退出、亦未免受日本先例之影響、二年以來、法國屢屢設法、欲使德日重返國聯、然對日希望已絕、對德則尙在進行之中、惟如對德交涉能有結果、則日本容或可以再行考慮也、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）日本退出國聯、德國最表同情、此間對於日本之態度、時有贊成之表示、蓋德國亦已於一九三三年十一月十四日聲明退出也、惟德國現在尙有考慮之餘地、目前方與各國進行討論、故猶未能正式宣言、與日本意見一致、惟德國對於國聯、事實上已毫無好感、政界方面以爲國聯不過爲凡爾賽和約之執行機關而已、至對於遠東問題、德國一般公意皆嚴守中立、惟以爲日本之退出國聯、則非常痛快耳、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>愛文諾言論　我代表嚴詞痛斥　認與盟約相牴觸</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）日內瓦日本總領事橫由今日對新聞記者發表一文、謂日本現雖出會、然國聯不能漠視日本在遠東權利較優之地位、而日本亦不能忽視國聯之爲有益的社會工作中最重要機關、故雙方仍將維持一種接洽、不過不似從前之直接耳、日本將繼續參加國聯人道主義之工作云、橫田言及太平洋中托愛島嶼事、謂日政府將繼續向國聯提出常年報吿云、中國駐瑞士公使胡世澤今日發言痛斥國聯秘書長愛文諾昨日所發關於日本正式與國聯脫離關係之言論、謂秘書長之言論、實屬矛盾、未得行政院或大會之同意、且與國聯盟約第一條相牴觸云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>松岡發狂言　世界劃一新時代</h3>

<h3>沙遜爵士發表　救濟中國金融方案</h3>
<p>路秀社上海消息、沙遜爵士今日對路透社發表談片、申說其和緩中國境內尤其是上海金融緊張情形之方案、沙遜爵士建議中國宣覓取英鎊借款、而以此為抵發行「上海鎊券」其性質等於英鎊、俾與上海銀元共同通行於市、為一種輔幣、或代替幣、依照沙遜爵士之方案、此種鎊券可在倫敦交付英鎊、而向特別委員會取得之或在上海按照英鎊匯價交付上海銀元取得之、如屬必要、不妨由市政局設法供給爲數較少之代用幣、沙遜爵士以爲中國仍需保守其銀本位、此次金融難關、乃美國購銀政策所造成、而此政策現可認爲失敗、中國尤其是上海、在此時代、必須設法渡其難關至美國放棄其現有購銀政策時而後已、渠以爲美國終必放棄其購銀政策、中國如用膨脹方法、以擴大其通貨、則貽害甚大、但若用隱健方法而擴大其通貨、則可立卽獲其利益、以渠意見、此種鎊券、用途頗多、如關稅之償付、進口貨之買賣、皆可用之、庶避免現有之匯兌上危險、再此新券較諸當地貨幣、尤宜於儲存、故當地貨幣可因此而流通於市、此種複幣、俟美國變通其政策時、或有他種因素發生可助中國脫離目前困難時、卽可取消、沙遜爵士以爲當地鎊券之存在、可使英鎊借欺爲可能、庶當地信用之結構可以擴大、而無需乎通貨之膨脹、</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透電社今日探悉沙遜爵士所發表救濟中國金融緊張之和緩方案、實與倫敦財政家數人近來確曾考量之方針不謀而合、此數財政家之意、中國因缺乏現金、且因金集團將來之地位變遷靡定、故無完全採用金本位之可能、至於貸欽與中國以購白銀、及將白銀運回中國、亦殊無益、蓋中國旣增購白銀、加以美國繼續驅銀價之上漲、將使目前之地位更形惡化也、惟倫敦之借欺可使中國採行沙遜爵士之方案、則地方之金鎊鈔票可用於各種廣大之用途、遇銀價上漲時、中國可以售出之而復投資於金鎊放欺、藉以開啟與金鎊聯絡之途徑、比國與瑞士似將照此辦理、至於中國保留充分之白銀、以供内國　用、似不致有多大困難云、觀察家數人現反對於舊幣之上復　新幣、蓋此舉徒使紛亂愈甚耳、彼等復聲明該問題非俟美國宣布對白銀之最後意志、終難解决、路透電社探悉倫敦現正在進行談判、以期以經濟助力給予中國、衆信美國現未參加此項談判、惟法國對於此舉、殊爲關心云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>美銀業大會　考慮白銀政策　四月初旬在華盛頓舉行</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）全國銀業聯合會將於四月五六二日在華盛頓舉行大會、以求白銀意見之結晶化、該會會長愛倫今日聲稱、一種通貨膨脹辦法、顯不在遠、雖過去二年中金價、幾增一倍、然迄未有充分黄金以扶助爲人需要之通貨、大會召集之目的、爲謀銀業之利益、但渠以爲應從國家立塲對於白銀問題作自由與透澈之討論、該會已請國會白銀派議員出席參加討論云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）美國財部購買國內新出礦之白銀、每盎斯給價六角四分半、今國外銀價已距此價格不遠、如國外銀價竟超過國內價格、則美國將何以應付之、此爲垣街方面近所討論之問題、有人預料政府將再頒佈收爲國有之命令、自一九三四年八月九日第一次收爲國有命令之日起、所有運入美國之白銀、一律收爲國有、又有人謂華盛頓現有一種壓力、主張照金元同樣比率减低銀元價値、庶將純銀每盎斯之價値增至二元一角八分九、並同時發行以白銀爲準備之更多鈔票、但若國外銀價繼續漲起、則當局不久勢必决定應否取消津貼國内產銀者政策之問題、如國會白銀派議員反對取消、政府定將賡續其現行政策、蓋據衆所知、白銀派參議員固堅持財部給付國內銀價高於國外之主張也、當局增髙津貼性質之銀價、誠未有通過立法案之必要、但衆覺政府無論規定更髙價格、抑或决定取消此種政策、皆將感覺此事之困難、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）財部現共已購進白銀三四二·〇六〇·〇〇〇盎斯、其中三一·〇七九·〇〇〇盎斯、係新出礦者、一一二·五八一·〇〇〇盎斯、係根據國有命令購得者、一九八·四〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯、係根據白銀收買法而購得者、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）金融新聞今日社論謂銀市投機事業之勃興、乃美國民主黨參議員湯姆士提出修正文主張發行銀券、以美當局所購白銀爲抵所致、蓋投機家預料此種修正文爲被通過、則官塲將積極收買白銀也、要此修正文能否爲國會及總流所通過、殊無把握、且此修正文縱被通過、亦未必卽作官塲將增購白銀之解、羅總統縱屈服於通貨膨脹派壓力之下、而不否决此修正文、然亦必竭力限制此修正文之影響、而不復多購白銀也、（二十七口路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日衆院以一八六票對七八票否决參院關於羅總統四十八萬八千萬元工賑案之修正文、而將此案送交兩院聯合會議、此爲國會白銀派之又一打擊、兩院聯席會議或將刪除參議員湯姆士所提出之修正文、査此修正文主張通貨膨脹、多發貨幣三萬七千五百萬元、其辦法分爲四種、（一）一財部發行銀券、以現有或將來所購得之銀條爲抵、而存銀之價値、照每盎斯一元二角九分計算、此項銀券可抵付到期債欺、俾得立卽流通於市、（二）此種銀券須使之流通、財部於收入此券後、應重新發行之、三四兩條授權財部酌量發行銀券、以收到他國抵付金價之銀爲抵、並依照定價收受他國淸償欠美債欵而付之白銀、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>英璽相艾登赴俄京　英俄談話尤具複雜性　蘇聯態度足左右大局　西門離柏林飛返倫敦</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）莫斯科全城現皆引領以待英國掌璽大臣艾登明晨之蒞臨、艾登今日在華沙、今晚八時十二分抵蘇俄邊界、將由特別歡迎委員會晤之、蘇俄英國事務專家溫白格氏亦在其列、一般人士對於艾登之至俄、異常注意、蓋此行似將較柏林之行有更大之複雜性、因德京之談話、蘇俄足以左右之也、衆信艾登因與希特勒會談之結果、將向蘇俄外委李維諾夫提出多種問話、蘇俄當局已取極嚴密之戒備、以防由柏林至莫斯科之旅程中發生意外事端、有警士一人、晝夜隨衛艾登、據路透隨車訪員電稱、有欲入艾登等所處車室者、輒愼加盤詰、駐倫敦蘇俄大使梅斯基亦同車返國、所居之室、與艾登相隔數門、不時入艾室作非正式之談話云、據柏林路透電稱、英外相西門已於今晨十時乘飛機返國、途中將在阿姆斯特丹小駐、進午餐、今晚可飛抵倫敦、瀕行時、德外長牛賴特英大使費浦士與大使署中諸職員均蒞飛行塲送別、希特勒曾派其特別衛隊至塲、於西門入飛機時舉鎗示敬、西門出發前曾接見法大使此公使意代辦、惟談話之性質未經宣露、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）英外相西門離此返倫敦時、官塲歡送盛况、與彼於上星期六抵柏林時相同、英外相於今晨九時二十分首向英大使費伯斯辭行、德外長牛賴特卽於九時四十分蒞安德龍旅館、伴同西門外相至柏林飛行塲、帝國航空公司之巨型飛機特利亞號卽整機待發、希特勒元首之近衛仍在塲護衛歡送、希特勒之代表以及英德大員亦均到塲歡送、西門與各要人握手言別、情意懇切、該機卽於十時正載英外相飛返倫敦而去、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>英員表示此行不虛</p>
<p>（柏林）英德談話已於昨夜終結、並未成立任何正式恊定、惟英國外相西門及其他英國代表皆無失望之容、且以爲殊不虛此行云、現在第二步問題、當爲掌璽大臣艾登之莫斯科·華沙·及柏拉格三處會議、英法意三國然後再行集合、一般人今日希望英德談話之英國方面報告、當能澄淸空氣、而使協約國决定應取之行動、英德談話之時、德國曾有坦白之表示、據美聯社自可靠方面得悉、談話範圍甚廣、如安全·軍備·空軍條約·及重返國聯等等問題、皆曾討論云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>意見參差已明症結</p>
<p>（柏林）聞西門與艾登對於此次談話結果、至爲滿意、西門啓程來此之前、已在下院聲明此行純屬探討性質、故無所謂妥協問題、今所能言者、英德兩政府已藉此會透澈闡明雙方之觀察點、討論之際、意見顯然有參差之處、但因意見之參差、今已明其所在、則此會可稱已如所願望矣、</p>
<p>西門與艾登此行、不特爲衆所願有、且迫於前事不得不有此一會、其事非僅英法最近公報一端而已也、蓋英政府雖責當抗議德國金整軍備之片面行動、但英法公報中所舉各點一日可資以討論、則英國仍有正當理由作此聘問、聞西門艾登此種見解、今已爲各方承認矣、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>米美爾判案　德人大為憤慨自治制度起動搖</h3>
<p>（柏林）立陶宛京城軍事法庭審訊米美爾區域國社黨案、分別判處嚴刑後、頃據德意志通訊社消息、東普魯士省哥尼斯堡城居民聞訊、起而表示反對、結隊遊行、高呼「打倒可恥之立陶宛司法」「爲米美爾區域德國同胞要求正義」云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）「國社黨正式通信」評論立陶宛軍事法院判决米美爾國社黨案、謂「此舉係出於立陶宛方面之挑釁、負責保障米美爾自治制度之列强、倘不欲使米美爾重蹈復轍、卽不應自甘　默、而有以儆後來、要之、立陶宛對於米美爾人民不配行使宗主權、今當設法救濟米美爾使出於水火」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據泰晤士報載稱、英法意曾以米美爾自治公約簽字國資格、於三月十三日聯合通吿立陶宛政府、謂三國實負維持米美爾公約之責云、惟觀今次對德僑案之判决、可知三國行動並未發生若何效果也云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）自由黨「孟却斯特保衛報」本日登載評論謂「米美爾區域之現制度、雖應保持至若干時日、然亦不宜歷久不變、西歐政治原則、多不能適用於東歐、例如最近但澤自由城之選舉、國社黨勢必出以恐怖主義之手段、卽其一端、査米美爾區域現行制度、旣不堅固、復缺少柔性、因此對於立陶宛與德國間之人種及民族衝突、無法加以消弭、可見在東歐非有所變更不可、不但米美爾政制須予變更、卽其他若干事物亦無不然」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各國報紙評論</h3>
<p>（柏林）德意志日報謂如後不發生糾紛、則有獲良好結果之明證云、又某報謂如柏林之工作日後能以同樣之誠意繼續進行、則今日意見縱仍參差、亦無庸灰心云、惟法國各報之意見皆以爲談話之結果、乃屬消極的、菲迦羅報謂德國之讐俄、乃此次談話顯明之結果、該報不信蘇俄之陸軍能爲害歐洲、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英報憂慮歐局前途</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國報紙對於柏林談話、略有批評、大致謂德國已關閉通入東歐公約之門戶、而使軍縮之前途愈形黯淡、每日電聞根據其柏林訪員所發關於希特勒種種强硬要求之電訊、謂英閣員現遇有較其預料更爲堅拗之態度、國社黨對於赤色蘇俄抱有惶慮與仇視、乃澄淸歐洲時局中之甚大障礙云、晨郵報稱、倫敦人士現對柏林談話抱悲觀、恐不久德圖將處於孤立地位、法俄等將造成有力團體、以抵制修改條約之要求云（廿七日路透電）</p>

<h3>柏林談話結束　德國提五項要求　為重返國聯會條件　反俄併奧此志不渝　空軍與英對等海軍對法優勢　改訂東部邊界取消波蘭走廊</h3>
<p>（柏林）據英國每日電聞報駐柏林特派員探悉、英德談話中、希特勒曾提出要求如下、</p>
<p>（一）德國空軍與英國對等、其標準視蘇俄空軍之標準以决定之、（二）德國有權建造海軍四十萬噸、卽較華盛頓條約所規定之法國海軍總噸數增加一倍、（三）取銷「波蘭走廊」、俾德屬東普魯士與德國本部連接、此外並發表宣言、聲明德國東部邊軍非一成不變、（四）改訂捷克疆域、使捷克境內三百五十萬德國人住居之土地、歸併德國、（五）德奧合併、希特勒並聲明、上述各項要求條件如獲得滿意、則德國準備重返國聯會云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英德柏林談話中、德國所提出之要求究係若何、官方雖須俟外相西門返國提出報吿後、方可明悉、但據半官式人士所稱、德國要求之內容與每日電聞報所載者大體相符云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）英德兩國閣員談話、業於昨晚結束、凡二月三日英法兩國倫敦宣言書所包括各項問題、卽（一）訂結一般軍縮公約、以代替凡爾賽和約軍事條欵、（二）德國重返國聯會、（三）德國加入東歐互助公約及多瑙河互不干涉公約、（四）英法德意比五國、訂結天空互助公約、均曾加以討論、英國外相西門、卽於今晨乘飛機返英、掌璽大臣艾登、則按原定計劃首途往莫斯科、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>發表公報</p>
<p>（柏林）關於英德兩國在柏林舉行之談話、今日德政府方面發表極審愼之公報如下、「希特勒元首牛輯特外長及里賓特羅浦專使、與英外相西門掌璽大臣艾登及英大使斐伯斯間之兩日會議、已於今夜結束、此次談話之事項、以二月三日倫教宣言中所述諸點爲根據、雙方均出於至誠之態度、及至友善之精神、故其結果對於各要點均已有完全之了解、現所確定者、兩國政府之目的、俱欲以增進國際合作、而保障及鞏固歐洲之和平、英德兩國當局對於此次直接交涉之效用、深爲欣慰」云、（廿六日國民電）</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>望、半官性質之勝利報竟直認英德談話爲「失敗」、而法國參謀本部之喉舌巴黎　聲報、卽目爲「無結果之談話」、費加樂報則稱此談話成爲「德之對俄案」、半官性質之小巴黎人報則謂德國之平等要求、今竟一變而爲對法優勢之要求矣、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）各報評論柏林談話結果、認爲屬於消極性質、但亦認爲有益、一如公報所稱所云、蓋以英國各閣員對於德國當局眞實意志、及其缺乏妥協精神、均可由此而得眞知灼見也、斐伽羅報謂「希特勒發言甚多、幷不明切、其中明切之處則又屬於消極性質」、「日報」以爲美國各閣員定必失望、「事業」報謂、「英國各閣員以爲德國政府有妥協之意、因而有發現妥協點之可能、此種希望現已歸於泡影、但西門外相必不自承失敗、而在斯特里薩會議努力提出限制軍備一般公約、所謂「折中案」此固德國所期待者、特未必能爲墨索里尼與賴伐爾所贊成耳、法國人士對於法俄接近、認爲無其必要者、亦且主張採取强硬政策、迅爲歐洲組織安全制度、實爲維護和平之唯一方法矣」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報不知反責諸已</h3>
<p>（柏林）政府授意之外交政治評論報、今日以「改弦更張」爲標題、評論今次英德會議、謂星期一首次會議時、希特勒元首會對英代表詳述其外交政策、闡明德國一如他國之深知其對國際合作之責任、且力使其合理而重要之利益、合於國際合作之條件、如能使此種新事實漸次代替對德之偏見、則將來談判之順利形勢、可由是而生、惜乎歐洲方面尙未臻於此也、一切不樂聞之事態、仍欲使德國於政治上及道德上負其責、曷克有濟云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>公報空泛難獲信任</h3>
<p>（維也納）此間各報均評論英德兩國代表柏林談話、「日報」載稱、「希特勒關於共產主義威脅之言論、含有火燄氣味、以此而欲與德國相接近、其誰信之、」新自由報載稱、「斯德萊柴會議與議諸人所負責任、極其重大、歐洲前途如何、在未來若干年中將於此項會議决定之、」維也納新聞報則謂、「國際政治家舉行會議所發表之公報、其內容之空泛、當以此次爲首屈一指、卽世界最樂觀之人、亦無從覔取最小限度之信任心」云云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）今日參院辯論法意協定之際、外長賴伐爾發言勸德國附合其他各國經營和平事業、賴氏謂德國不能無限期長此避免其義務、此非爲依據某種條件獲得平等權利或復返國聯問題、而爲德國是否願附合其他各國組織和平問題云、辯論旣畢、投票表决法意協定、經大多數通過、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）參議院本日開會、討論一月七日在羅馬簽字之法意恊定、當經參議員二百八十五人全體一致通過、將該恊定加以批准、本案討論時、外長賴伐爾發表演說、首先贊揚意相墨索里尼、謂値茲凡爾賽條約遭德國破壞之際、意國竟能以全力擁護國際聯繫之事業、而不作任何保留、實使吾人大爲欣慰、至對於最近德國重整軍備一事、英法意三國問一切行動、完全互相聯絡、此種和平的聯合政策、絕無反對任何他國之意、且吾人所要求之安全、亦係各國共同之安全、吾人之主張、始終如一、迄未變更、旣不存隱私、亦不懷異志、謀使各國和平咸獲保障、各民族之榮譽尊嚴咸受尊重、如是而已、至於他國內政制度、則與吾人無關、吾人絕不願加以干涉、吾人當與各民族及各國政府、繼續爲集體和平組織而努力、羅馬協定之簽字者雖僅法意兩國、然係完全開放、目前不願簽字之各國、將來均可隨時參加、吾人所欲爲德國吿者、卽德國不應再抱游移遁飾之態度、所謂軍備權平等、所謂德國重返國聯會之條件、均已不成問題、唯一之問題、卽德國是否顧與他國聯合參加組織和平之工作是也、」賴伐爾繼復述及一九三一年故外長自里安聘問柏林時、法德人民之熱烈情况、謂法國人民對德感情、仍與彼時相同、未有變更、最後賴伐爾主張法國必須與各國增進友好及同盟關係、但同時亦必以自力防衛國土、其結語則謂、「吾人必須堅强而團結、方可無後顧之憂」云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>防萊茵方面威脅　法意切實攜手</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法意已切實携手、以防萊茵之威脅、蓋參院昨日已一致批准近在羅馬成立之法意協定、該協定規定法意在歐洲及非洲殖民地方面之合作、外長賴伐爾於辯論中稱頌意相墨索里尼、同時法國政府已實行禁止國內軍火原料輸入德國、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<h3>米商　訂購大批洋麥　市社會局査明眞相</h3>
<p>關於增收洋麥進口稅一事、邇來甚囂塵上、惟據中央社記者調査、此種傳說、實屬不確、財部方面、曾咨請本巿市政府調査本市訂購洋米麥情形、因外間有此猜測、茲據記者向可靠方面探悉、詳情分誌於後、</p>
<p>市府咨復財部</p>
<p>本市巿政府、前曾准財政部咨、以據漢口市商會呈、爲本市廠家有訂購大批洋麥、將影響國麥銷路、請爲調杳眞相等因、本市市政府當經飭由社會局、向商人方面調查、自一月份起、至最近止、進口洋麥爲一百五十萬噸、洋米爲六百萬袋、按漢口市商會所呈內容、擬請禁止洋麥入口、並無請求財部增加洋麥進口稅字樣、故此次所傳財部將增收洋麥進口稅一事、當屬誤會所起、本市社會局、自將真相調查明白後、業已呈請市政府、咨復財政部矣、</p>
<p>洋麥進口見減</p>
<p>查自財政部征收洋麥進口稅以來、洋麥進口、已見减少、本市洋麥多用爲製粉之用、蓋製粉而純用國麥、在製造上諸多不便、故必採用洋麥、往年洋麥進口、較諸本年為數尙鉅、自當局征收洋麥稅以來、一般粉廠、以儘先用國麥製粉、據海關進口調查、洋麥進口、確已見减、</p>
<p>增稅不致實現</p>
<p>財政部對於洋麥增稅一事、以洋麥進口、數量已見减少、據悉未有此意、最近本市市塲上之發生增稅傳說、據熟悉商情之某君云、因若干商人鑒於最近麥粉價格趨跌、如洋麥迆口無已、則麥價恐將再度敝跌、故自洋麥進口增稅一事傳出後、市塲上麥價已稍見髙、惟按目前供應上觀察、增收洋麥稅、當不致實現云、</p>
<h3>財政部派專　督查印花銷售　王文蔚昨到滬卽赴浙江督査　郵局代購梭獨浙省等無起色</h3>

<p>昨據該公司發言人語大公社記者、關於吳淞區域之自來水工程、閘北水電公司、於一二八前、卽經計劃就緒、凖備動工、旋因滬戰發生、閘北原有水電建設、均被破壞、戰事停後、努力恢復舊有工程、並建設市中心區各項工程、致吳淞區工程計劃、迄未實行、最近始與公用局訂立合同、開始裝置張華浜·蕰藻浜·等地之水管工程、以該處稅務機關、需水甚亟、故業由市中心區之水管、延長接通、現已開始給水、</p>

<h3>要通古書再等一百年</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>我所謂「古書」，指「五經」及「先秦諸子」而言。「通」的限度指「看懂文句，看通義理」。「再等一百年」是一句眞實的話，沒有半點誇張的意味。</p>
<p>淸代以前，從來沒有讀通過古書，那是事實。西漢今文家把陰陽五行家的外套穿在儒家身上，把孔子和五經連在一起，於是五經非本來的五經，儒家非本來的儒家，孔子非本來的孔子，董仲舒之流說春秋，劉向之流說洪範，目的在迎合君王的心理，作升官發財的工具，那樣的說經，永遠說不通的，所以今文家雖玩了微言大義，古書並未讀通是顯然的。東漢古文家以周公爲聖人，以孔子爲述而不作，訓詁方面頗爲努力；但看他們說堯典「粵若稽古」說了二三十萬言，决不會有什麽高明的見解；而且第一流大學者把全副精神去和今文學家閙意見，意氣之爭太多，把本義抛開了；可見古文家也不曾把古書讀通過。東漢末年，鄭玄融合今古文的工作是有意義的，可是他除了訓詁以外，理義上的理解力太薄弱，沒有什麼大成就，也算不得讀通古書。古書在魏晋以後，只有易老莊三書，經過淸談家的賞識，別有會心；其他部份是冷落下去，今文家的章句也先後亡佚了。唐人的註疏，因爲他們重北學，輕南學，反而把一些僞學竄了進去，古書的面目全非，更說不上通古書。宋明理學家以禪學爲靈魂，借儒家的屍體復活起來：他們的讀古書，都是借他人杯酒，澆自己的塊壘。如朱熹的四書集註，只是朱子的哲學講義，和孔孟的本義有時竟會「風馬牛不相及」。由此路以求通，其終點是印度，和釋迦牟尼站在一起了。加以明代學問家的固陋，古書給他們搗亂得一塌糊塗，其去古書愈遠，愈無從求通了。</p>
<p>整理古書向「通」的路上走，自淸初經學家起。顧亭林的參互博證，胡渭，閣若琥的辨別僞書，開了淸代考瞪學的先河；他們努力把前人所加於古書上的葛籐，一一剔挖淸楚，恢復古書的本來面目，精神和方法都是科學的實證的。乾嘉以後考證學家努力所得的成績是可驚的。戴東原所謂，「志存聞道，必空所依傍。漢儒訓詁，有師承·有時亦傅會，晋人傅會鑿空益多；宋人則恃胸臆以爲斷，故其襲取者爲謬，而不謬者反在其所棄。宋以來儒者，以已之見硬坐爲古聖賢立言之意，而語言文字實未之知；其於天下之事也，以已所謂理强斷行之，而事情源委隱曲實未能得，是以大道失而行事乖。」直把古人瞎講古書情形一一說出。又謂：「凡僕所以尋求於遺經，懼聖人之緒言闇沒於後世也。然尋求而有獲十分之見者，有未至十分之見者；所謂十分之見，必徵諸古而靡不條貫，，合諸道而不留餘議，鉅細畢究，本末兼察；若夫依於傳聞以擬其是，擇於衆說以裁其優，出於空言以定其論，據於孤記以信其通；雖溯流可以知源，不目睹淵泉所導，循根可以達杪，不手披枝肆所歧，皆未至十分之見也」。也把怎樣求通的態度和方法都說出來了。經過那些考證學家的辨僞，校勘，考證，五經才粗粗可通，諸子也漸漸可通。但考瞪學家所整理的工作，散見那麽龐大的淸經解，續淸經解裏，後人要從那裏去求通，决無此精力，亦無此時間；因此宋明理學家的註解，唐人的註疏，依舊在社會上流行着。現在結總賬的工夫已經開始了，墨子，莊子之類都有很好的註解出來，四五十年後，五經之類，也會有定本的集註。目前的靑年正不必性急，讓四五十年後的人去讀古書，也未爲遲。</p>
<p>特別要提出的是：光緒二十四五年，殷墟（安陽）發見龜甲那件大事，和中央研究院近年在安陽一帶的發掘工作。龜甲文供給殷周時代的地下史料；有了龜甲文字研究，尙書研究方開闢出新天地，王國維的古史新證，顧頡剛的古史講義，郭沫若的古代社會研究出來，孫星衍的尙書今古文註疏又成爲十一首，無足輕重了。中央研究院的地下發掘工作，正在積極進行，年年有大量的新發見，關於殷晚期的文化，關於靑銅期西歐與東亞的文化交流，關於股代宮室明堂的制度，關於殷代坂築的方法，關於殷周棺槨的制度，關於古車的制度，…目前都有新的認識，三五十年後的古史，將不知改變成爲怎樣的新面目呢！龜甲文字的研究，必待一百年後方能完成：那時的殷周古史，又不知改變成爲怎樣的新面目。在西洋，埃及古史本來也很荒謬；十九世紀後半期，考古學家在荒原上做發掘埃及古代陵墓的工作，在研究室中絞腦汁來解釋埃及的文字，居然寫成了埃及史的新頁，十八世紀以前學者所不曾夢見的古史。我們所得的地下史料這樣豐富，也許比埃及史還能寫得完備些。</p>
<p>所以要通古書，切莫性急、請再等一百年，等考古學家發掘出來，研究出來。</p>
<h3>小攤的夜市</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>在霓虹燈，汽車，時裝姑娘的大都市夜裏，是早看不到這樣的夜市了。</p>
<p>這樣的夜市還是中世紀的。</p>
<p>自家是一個寂寞的人，走在那麼舊世紀風姿的夜的街上，也覺到像畫幅的色彩的配合很調和的。</p>
<p>夜的街，半開的店舖內，張着汽油燈，冷落地方裝着火油路燈，在暗澹朦朧的黄色燈影下，最好看的是一堆一堆林立着的小攤子。</p>
<p>在店舖前，城門口，牆角處，街的拐彎地方，全擺着小攤，裝製簡單！一張小板檯子，檯脚是很矮短的，上面裝攤着各樣食物；一雙火油小燈下，映着一堆堆見紫紅色的褐色的猪肉·野兎子的腿子，斬開的半雙鷄…，一個人守着攤子傻坐在旁邊，等待每個顧客來做幾個大子（本地人呌犬銅元爲大子）的交易。</p>
<p>各樣攤子實在太多，難記起來。</p>
<p>裝着一鍋子麵條粥的攤子也特多，常看到有二三個人伏在那很低的攤子上據着一盌吃；這情景下，我總想到民間的慘澹的生活—</p>
<p>暗燈光下，映着幾張黧黑的臉色，呷着一盌像漿糊樣的麵條粥。</p>
<p>另外油煎麵餅的小攤也不少，攤子上張着沒罩子的煤油燈，黑烟蓬蓬地向上竄着，油鍋裏熚熚剝剝的騰着一股濃膩的油味，攤子四周好多孩子的小黑手伸在那里等着。</p>
<p>也雜有擺水菓的，擺雜貨小用品的，然而惠顧的人似乎太少，那個擺攤的人老是瞪着眼珠見在那里閑看街景。</p>
<p>一條街，幾十個小攤子，各種攤上張着各樣燈，有講究一點的攤子上裝着方玻璃的媒油燈，夜市在形式上也點綴成很閙了。</p>
<p>跟朋友一起走上夜市的街，那個朋友對我說：</p>
<p>—這兒只有小攤的夜巿呵！</p>
<p>—然而有些攤子一點做不到生意吧？</p>
<p>—是囉！一個黄昏做一二十個銅子生意的攤子很多哩！</p>
<p>—然而他們要靠這小數目生活着。</p>
<h3>戰爭雜記（十三）</h3>
<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>那全然像是大家在一塊兒共同念經。</p>
<p>連長幾次想要把指揮刀拔出來，却遲疑着。最後，當那多數的黑影走近到一百多米突的地方來了的時候，一個斥候就跑回來報告：</p>
<p>「中尉大人，前面的兵士，×××××連和×連，正在敗退着。完了。」</p>
<p>大家都吃了一驚，走近去一看：你說那喊聲是怎麽攪起的！原來就是敗退着的傷兵的哭聲。那好像已經變成了空充子般的大漢子們的哭聲。</p>
<p>「那一連人，幾乎誰都受了傷。因爲在那邊（地名我已經忘記了）曾有十分激烈的戰鬥。那奇怪的哭聲還留在我的耳朶裏；但，那種像瘋人般的哭聲，却直到我自己在首山堡受了傷的時候，才曉得了個中的况味」。</p>
<p>阿熊哥不能够把飯碗捧起來，怪笨拙的。‘</p>
<p>「與其勉强地活着，還不如戰死了好」。</p>
<p>我記得：阿熊哥這麽說着就把握筷子的左乎掩住臉孔，哭泣着。（完）</p>
<h3>閔行行（二）</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>我也幷無愛於寛綽的坐位，過了半淞園，就到船頭上去遠眺。兩岸逐漸荒凉，僅斷續有些工廠。沿江岸沒有馬路，也沒有樹木，恐怕就秋天速蘆葦也沒有。上海的發展眞太畸形了。不說一株楊柳一株桃那樣的長堤，可以點綴出美麗風景，免得龍華一點可數的桃花，老被淺見的都市人當作寳貝；沿江闢一條馬路，照例裁上些法國梧桐之類，游人固順帶受點利益，而這一帶的水陸交通兩便以後，也便預備在這設立工廠的踴躍些。這帶的地點，不是比蘇洲河兩岸好些嗎？</p>
<p>船票上在上海閔行之間印有好多碼頭，但實際只　了三個，都在浦東。第三個的閘港恰好在浦江的東西流折成南北流的折處。過閘港就望得見閔行，這裏江面已狹了許多，水也不是黃色而帶點淡綠。不知黄浦下游的混水是揚子江中的水被潮逆冲進來的呢？抑或是被船隻激混了的？從前我以爲黄浦江的水天然是該和江水（居在揚子江邊的人是道稱揚子爲江的）一樣顏色，我看見的水被稱爲江的水似乎都是泥黄，以水的淸潔著名的西江的水，也是很黄，桂江很淸了，但當地人稱作撫河，，河面也確很狹，似乎只有閔行那裏的浦江一半，就不當作江算。竟想不到這誤認原來黄浦就能指示我。</p>
<p>到閔行已十一時過了。知道要下午一時才有去上海的長途汽車，但第一步我還是先問車站在那裏。碼頭上的警祭大槪驚訝我的乘船而來會馬上要乘車而去吧，把我打量了一下，才吿訴我。我於是向西走到馬路，這路也不致就是閔行街市的西盡頭，滬杭公路的輪渡就在這路頭的江岸，滬閔路站却在裏面的第三道街口，我望見站，沒有去就由第二道街重折入閔行市街，向東走至一十字街，是閔行的最熱閙的地方了，但在那裏回想上海，也已渾如隔世。由十字街折回江岸，東行至一河邊，因爲在船上看見河東房屋很少，沒有過去，又從第二道街折回十字路口。在第二十字路看見第三道街的冷落，就逕向北走，北街也是很冷靜的，兩邊再沒有街，有些曲折的小巷，大概是住宅區了。北街的長大致與東西街相等，這座一面臨江，一面臨河，一面界馬路的小巿鎭就大致是一方形。我把北街走盡後時間仍早，又不知閔行有什麽名勝，就在街巷上亂走了一頓。</p>
<h3>轆轤</h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>在往復的辛苦裏，</p>
<p>沉吊着一個重担，</p>
<p>像一顆忐忑的心</p>
<p>沉吊在緊張的心頭上。</p>
<p>搖一下把，</p>
<p>聽一聲苦澀的轆，轆。</p>
<p>喘一口氣，</p>
<p>想一陣難述的苦處。</p>
<p>彎下腰，</p>
<p>看重担提得多髙了；</p>
<p>抬起頭，</p>
<p>看水可流到了隴疇？</p>
<p>還得搖，</p>
<p>還得搖，</p>
<p>還得聽苦澀的轆，轆，</p>
<p>聽苦澀的轆，轆。</p>
<h3>回鄉小記</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>父親已經葬在山上，這次回到紹興去，無非看看母親，帶便伺在家中養病的三弟討論點事情。坐在燒炭的汽車上，過了錢淸，不久就沿着運河進行，隨時可以望見蜿蜒的會稽山脈。運河裏水滿盈盈，白帆的大酒船，烏篷的　花船，二道四道的明瓦船，爬蝶螄的搖搖船，小小的蹈槳船和拖鷄豹的淺水汽船，前前後後的擁擠，不絕的來來往往，猶如繁盛的街道上的「車水馬龍」。這固然是水村的特殊情形，更其因爲山陰道上］所以這樣熱鬧。田間菜花已黄，首蓿綠瑩瑩，也是將要開花的樣子了。小山一般髙疊着的空酒罎，和長長整排的石消牆，日前由審陽遊子郁氏說穿，確是故鄕所特有的景物。</p>
<p>到尊儀橋下車以後，由小搖船渡到化龍橋邊。順着彎彎曲曲的石板小路，緩步走到家中。在進村子的時候，首先到了幼時常同堂兄一道捕蟋蟀的地方，是有着　多會開紫色喇叭花的本槿的。</p>
<p>交通的確是便利的了，從從容容的吃了午餐，暢暢快快的談了天，動身來杭州，時間還是很寬裕。爲着重行仔細認識一番故鄕的景物，早想直接步行到汽車站；我就利用這寬裕的時間實行。三弟伴送我到方家漊的木橋邊，走到接渡庵就得抽渡船。渡船已有二十多年沒有抽了，跨下豆腐乾一般的方塊船裏去，倒仍然站得穩；從小學好了的事情的確不容易忘却。江面很闊，一個人慢慢的抽完由稻草搓成的繩索，固然不感到恐慌，也並不覺得吃力，因爲與趣頗好。我要步行，抽一回渡船原也是一種目的。但我到了渡船頭，並不當即跨下船去，却先在接波庵裏玩了一趟。這是鬥蟋蟀的塲所，已經有了很久的歷史，一到秋天就熱鬧，鬥蟋蟀到最後要「奪魁」］也是在這裏舉行的。</p>
<p>有着七十二個漊的故鄕，與其說是陸地裏有水，不如說是水面上有陸地；從髙處望去，只覺得蹙永面上浮着一塊一塊的陸地的。走得不過一里多點路，經過皇城寺的旁邊，又到了一個渡船頭。</p>
<p>皇城寺的規模很大，也很有名，裏面有着許多和尙。相傳南宋的小康王曾經逃難到這寺裏，和尙因爲出來相帮，就被大鼻子的金兀杰殺掉了一半。「皇城寺的和尙一半，」這在家鄕是句通行話，往往不明說「一半」的字樣，用「皇城寺的和尙」來代替。</p>
<p>這個渡船頭就在運河的一邊。這一段的運河雖然並不　，可是來往的船隻很多，抽渡船要小心。渡船停在對岸，並沒有人抽過來，就得先抽一回空渡船。河面小，渡船繩却粗得很，也是由稻草搓成的。我剛渡到一半，越安輪船拖着三隻公司船過來了，咕嚕咕嚕的響着，水面鼓起來了很大的波浪，渡船發宕，好像是在海洋上遇到暴風了；我只覺得是有意思的。</p>
<p>過了這僩波，一上岸就望得見汽車站上的水塔。一路沿着運河，汽車道和舊有的官塘平行。我不走汽車道，在官塘上緩緩踱步，爲着多看點河中的景物。正有許多鷺驚在捕魚；這也叫做水老鴉的畜生，每天只吃得些許豆腐或者細魚，却盡力去捕得大魚來獻媚主人，給主人做兇猛的爪牙，爲家鄕的一般人所最愛養的。</p>
<p>回望東浦村，房屋隱約可見。從前以爲各處鬧匪患，故鄕還可以苟且的安住；這次的回鄕，打破了這個念頭。就在前一天的晚上，在我冢同一漊底的花　門裏，被强盜從夾牆縫裏攻進，搶去了四百多元的乎飾衣物。者還是偶然的事情，可是熱誠畢校，本村惟一的敎育機關，是徐錫麟烈士所乎創的，有着三百多畝田的基本金，曾經設立過兩處分校，同時敎育千把個學生過，因爲收成壞而捐稅重，無法維持，如今還關着校門。我家從我起，一直到八妹，都是由這學校裏出來的。可是侄子們，到了學齡，沒有可以讀書的地方了。據說前學期，由幾位曾經做過國會議員和前淸的舉人秀才的老先生盡義務，勉强維持了幾天。他們的筆睪當然不錯，只是對於兒童，未免隔膜；現在且運這樣也遼沒有做到！</p>

<h3>救濟工商與維護國產</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>最近來救濟工商的呼聲，洋洋盈耳，的確的已瀕於絕境的現下我國工商業，在破產的掙扎綫止，我們全國大衆倘再不加以切實的援手，那麼，整個國民經濟的解體，前途是不堪設想，不過，在這裏，我們應常同時知道，工商的基礎，本是建築在國貨的能否發展上，年來國貨工業的衰竭，外受帝國主義市塲獨佔，商品傾銷的威脅，內受農村破產，市面不景氣的重壓，銷路是日見减少，價格是益趨低落，沒落的前途，趨勢自是每况愈下，所以，我們在今日而謂救濟普遍的工商業，實應先從維護正在萌芽時代的「國貨生產工業」着手。</p>
<p>講到維護國產的策略，當然首須認淸國貨前途的危機，它的癥結究何在，我們知道，國貨工業在現階段，是又有了一個新的局面，自美國施行白銀政策以來，國內存銀，滾滾外流，以金融界的恐慌，而工業放欵萎縮，信用制度的不健全，益使一般從事企業界的躊躇不安，無路可走，「擱淺，」「破產，」時有所聞，而整個工商界在這不景氣的籠罩下，風雨前途，自更受到外來惡勢力的無窮摧折，因此在這時候，我們要救濟工商，必先維護國產，而維護國產，必須注意下列二項主要任務的施行；</p>
<p>（一）金融業與國貨界澈底合作國貨進行，本須多方面的推動，而經濟助力，尤屬重要，值此危機臨前，我金融業自身，實也應有相當的憬悟，要知道在通常的情形之下，多進口一元洋貨，或是少出口一元土產，實在就得使金融業多溢出一元的資金，而民力枯竭的結果，也會影饗到金融業的繁榮，所以，像最近錢業公會的决議拒絕經營外國奢侈品放欵，和許多銀行决定除機械和必需原料之外，取消洋貨進口押匯和押欵，自是國貨前途的福音，而希冀金融界再計劃創造大量的工業信用，以策進國內工業和土貨出口，切實與國貨界相合作，自更重要。</p>
<p>（二）我國貨工業自身的努力如一方面解除同業競爭，互與外貨相週旋，一方面謀改進技術，節减成本，以最低廉的價格，向國內外各地普遍的推行等。</p>
<p>總之，「維護國產，」是要「减少入超」，「减少入超」，就可杜塞「白銀外流」，「金融穩定，」而整個工商界的景氣，也得由幾瀕破產的深淵中、漸次恢復過來。</p>
<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>國貨界與承兌滙票</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>承兌匯票，是賣方賣出或運出了貨物，開一匯票請求買方簽定兌欵日期，到期承認照數兌付，購物的買主，在立法院票據法上，名日「承兌人。」這種匯票，呌做「承兌匯票。」賣主接受這種匯票以後，卽可向銀行或錢莊貼現，銀行錢莊，如再將這種匯票貼現於中央銀行或其他銀行，呌做重貼現。</p>
<p>向來商塲習慣，貨物買賣，只有現付和放賬兩種。但目下商工業範圍日廣，如果交易必須現付，不但買方難以應付，且交易不易擴展。如果完全放賬，則賣方須備幾年資金，又感周轉不靈，獨此承兌匯票，足以解决雙方的困難，旣使賣方可以周轉其經濟，而買方約期付欵，不致毫無準備，銀行錢莊則有殷實信用的保障，旣得流通其資金，復得扶助工商的發展。在這國貨工業急待擴展，苦於資金不足的時代，承兌匯票，確爲最穩妥最便捷的手續，使廠方客家金融業三方面，形成連鎖之關係，而打成一片，是發展國貨的最良辦法。金融業中金國寶氏最先提倡，近頃王延松氏亦竭力鼓吹。綢緞業中如美亞織綢等廠，行之已久。最近綢緞業旣已一致仿行，楊蔭溥章乃器張肖梅三君，發表工商業金融問題研究報告書，亦以現代銀錢市塲之骨幹，爲票據貼現。力主各方利用票據之授受，使帳面固定的債權，變爲流通的票據。一轉移間，市上數萬萬元之帳面，固定債權，卽可依票據貼現的方式，而取得資金之通融，足以挽救當前工商界之危機。爲金融業自身計，銀行承兌票據之創造，以及重貼現方法實行，亦屬必要。須知銀行承兌票據之運用，亦可使棧存貨物，變成流通票據，自身的周轉益以便利。可見承兌隴票的辦法，爲各方一致所倡導，我國貨工廠在這貨物呆滯金融周轉困難的時候自當與金融業開誠布公，商定辦法，切實試行。在金融業亦當排除私利，及挑剔的惡習委曲求全，予工廠以種種便利。這種辦法，行而有效，則國貨工業與金融業交受其利，其發展可以預卜。</p>
<h3>「服用國貨」為復興市面的救命針</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>赴菲歸來的前上海市商會主席王曉籟先生，對於救濟衰敗市而的談話，很足予吾人以注意與深省！他晚；「復興市面，係積極行動，而救濟市面，則爲消極辦法，欲言復興，非政府獎勵國貨，人民服用國貨不可，蓋其他一切，均非根本，」一云云這幾句話，眞是一針見血！</p>
<p>我們知道：自銀源源外流的原因何在？這是殺人不見血的洋貨傾銷與同胞無恥，購買洋貨所迭成的！有眼光而識見遠者警告我們，苟國人再熱中洋貨，尤其是摩登女子，不知醒覺！深信國寶—白銀—流光！充塞紙幣將無法兌現，屆時外國經濟鎖鍊，勢將絞死四萬萬的中國人，那時噬臍何及？</p>
<p>我以爲人人服用國貨，不特足以復興商市，而且保全原氣，即所以保全自己的生命！親愛的國人，其速醒覺！</p>
<h3>國貨在蓬萊</h3>
<p>— 秋萍</p>
<p>蓬萊市塲，是南市唯一的國貨商塲，它雖然沒有十層二十層的大厦，更沒有偉大的廣告，可以誘惑人們的購買心，可是那平房式的市屋裏面長方形的水門汀道路，還算得潔靜。但是它對於一般的供給，是無所不有，因之它在南市對於居民是非常便利，所以蓬萊市塲的確可以稱爲南市唯一的市塲。</p>
<p>在南市各學校的學生在課後都要到那裏去散步或購物，但是我對於該市塲感覺到有兩點缺點，所以特地借本刋一角來貢獻一點愚見，深望該市塲當局採納之。</p>
<p>（一）一條狹狹的環道上，常常濟滿了往來的人，尤其是在例假的一天，在這種情形之下，最怕是車子的來來去去，所以該市塲每每有黃包車，自由車，包車的進出，而發生意外的事情，撞倒小孩哩！拉破了遊人的衣服哩　以致往往發生爭噪，本人也曾經被車子拉破衣服的一份子，像這種事情太使人可怕了，所以希望當局應該立時禁止一切車子，不准入內，撞倒遊人和拉破衣服等事，雖然這是小事，但是常此以往，則對於該市塲的營業，未免不有損失吧。</p>
<p>（二）上面已經說過，蓬萊市塲裏面的道路是很狹的，再加有幾家商店，把廣告牌擱置在道路的中心，再有幾家把一切商品搬在自己店的面前，—它的地位，大約佔去了街道的三分之一—，他們的目的，無非是廣告性質吧了！他們的用意雖好，可是他們的行動侵佔公益，妨碍公衆的行爲至少是不應該有的。</p>
<p>最後深望當局，有以限止爲妙。</p>
<p>一週間國貨新訊</p>
<p>鐵道部定七月一日在靑島舉行四屆鐵路沿綫出產品展覽會。</p>

<p>學生國貨年推行委員會，定四月十八日在市政府舉行全市學生服用國貨宣誓典禮。</p>
<h3>「兩全其美」</h3>
<p>— 歸麗</p>
<p>世界上的事，很難有兩全其美的！</p>
<p>譬如說：我們每天呼吸的空氣當中，常常充滿着各種微菌，這些微菌不免沾在人的皮膚上面，如果由毛孔或微傷的地方侵入體內，就能發生危險的疾病！所以每天必須用藥皂沐浴，洗手，殺菌護膚，就是頂好的預防的辦法；但是我們知道，藥肥皂乃是洋貨喲！購用洋貨，那是對不起祖國的。</p>
<p>不用藥皂，皮膚沒有保障，用了藥皂，又要使利權外溢，這不是「世事很難兩全其美」的明證嗎。</p>
<p>可是最近傳來一個可喜的消息，就是以製造國貨洗衣皂見重國人的五洲固本皂廠，最近又出品一種「固本藥皂「了，這種藥皂是費了多時的研究，才製造成功，它的內容和效力，都在洋貨之上，從今後國人旣能使身體淸潔衛生，又有廉美的國貨使用，可說是「兩全其美」了；同時我更希望國內各國貨工廠，都向兩全其美的路上走。</p>

<h3>怎樣救濟工商業？</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>上海金融恐慌工商業呼號救濟，已經成爲很大的問題了，但各方面祇在研究「以何救濟」？而還很少聽到「如何救濟」？的呼聲。「以何救濟」？誠是極困難問題，無論來源是從政府是從金融界，是從什麼方面，七拚八凑的結果，是「剜肉補瘡」的計劃，總之「一粥一飯，當思來處不易」，越是不易得來，越要用得有價值，就是數量少，也要用得有價值，纔有人肯拿大數量出來，最好，經過這一次是救濟，從此不需要第二次救濟，今天沒有力量，受人救濟，明天有了力量，來救濟別人，那纔不負今番救濟苦心了，工商業如何需要救濟呢？工商業當局定會說：這是大局關係「非戰之罪」不錯，可是放眼看來，平心靜氣想來，我們的工商業，內容充實而整飭的，固然不少，充實而不整飭的也有在現今和世界各世界各國「商戰」的時候至少要備具三國志演義所說：「軍容整肅，號令嚴明兵精糧足」，兵不精，粉不足，固然不行，兵精糧足，而軍容不整肅，號令不嚴明，又安能僥倖打勝仗呢！和本國人「商戰」已經不行，何况世界各國「商戰」？救濟內容不充實，需要「有貝之財」，「有貝之財」固然重要，「無貝之才」亦何當不重要，俗語不是說「開店容易用人難」嗎？如果工商業當局諸君，獲得營業發達的結果，這不是光靠諸君的資本，一大半還是靠諸君的才幹，如果承認「開店容易用人難」的話，有人箇手拿了「有貝之財」，來帮助你充實內容，把可以使你成功的條件，一概完備，可以使你失敗的條件一概消滅，那麼虛心而負責的工商當局，怕沒有欣然接受的罷</p>

<p>銀錢業務自日前恢復常軌以來、形勢已日見進展、各種交易亦較前暢達、如中途不發生波折、則蒸蒸日上可以預卜、昨市塲中洋拆早午兩市均掛七分、與前日相同、而劃頭加水仍始終白劃、拆票交易、早市轉賬三百九十餘萬、新交易四十餘萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會中交易八十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖五十餘萬、新做出九十餘萬、各路滙欵七十餘萬、鈔票交易收回一百六十餘萬、發出一百二十餘萬、又暗記券一百十餘萬、客路來源二十萬、去胃四十萬、銀行收洋、亦日見進步、計外商銀行收解票欵二百八十餘萬、電滙欵五十餘萬、各種滙貨什欵收解三百三十餘萬、特種滙欵六十餘萬、外滙結欵一百十餘萬、進倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百六十餘萬、各種滙押貨稅等什欵收解四百六十餘萬、電滙欵四十餘萬、特種滙欵八十餘萬、外滙結欵一百三十餘萬、出倉三十餘、日商銀行收解票欵二百七十餘萬、外匯結欵七十餘萬、各種貨押什欵收解二百十餘萬、特種滙欵五十餘萬、出倉十萬、錢莊洋公單收洋二千五百餘萬、洋劃頭借收解三百五十餘萬、現欵收解合直、</p>
<p>昨江南小洋、以早午兩市均無成交、故仍掛八百三十八元、廣東小洋、早市爲七百三十二元三角、午市爲七百三十二元四角、結果較前日微小九角、做出交易、早市十五萬五千角、午市八萬五千角、銅元仍爲三百三十六千文、亦與前日同、交易數額四萬二千串文、合代價洋一萬二千五百元、</p>
<p>本市票據交換所廿七日交換總數、銀元一千零六十三萬六千二百八十一元五角九分、內計銀元五百七十三萬八千零十九元零八分、滙劃銀元四百八十九萬八千二百六十二元五角一分</p>
<h3>證劵　公債零星買賣居多</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、仍祗做四月份期貨一個月、市面上落甚微、祗四十三號買進整六、比較熱鬧、餘則仍孫零星散戶買賣、遠期尚未上市多數觀望、故交易亦淸、惟九穴時作不整理及停拍流言、其實九六已有相當歷史、當初係抵還銀行舊欠、其地位與他項整理公債無異、日金部份、正擬整理辦法、抵償銀行部份、政府縱無力同時整理、亦斷不致栽者培之、傾者覆之、轉令其停拍也、迭謠者是否另有作用、姑觀其後可也、昨日經過忽高忽低、無大差別、九六遽跌三角、午後回上一角、全日交易、當以四十三號　進整六爲最多、計其市便結果、大都跌落一二角至三角半、成交總數、計共四百二十七萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>美橡皮股交易獨佳</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告昨（二十六日）紐約股市、參差略降、交易者咸集中注意於橡皮與白銀、國際橡皮限制委員會之將出產限額减低、殊出乎意料兼以橡皮之期貨市面呈售出過度之象、致市况飛漲一百餘磅音、至銀價之堅、乃由於美國之繼續買進、目因衆信國會中之白銀派欲减低銀元之成色、而使銀價等於一元二角九分、惟湯麥士之工賑案修正文業巳遭衆委之拒絕、故希望亦甚渺茫也、比佛郎極弱、交易者仍信其必將减值、而金集團亦將破裂、債市略跌、美政府公債則屬例外、蓋第四次自由公債百分之八十業經掉換、故趨上游、小交易所股票無甚軒輊、小麥亦漲跌不一、一因恐外麥進口、二因阿根廷反對維持本年收成終止前世界小麥之最低價格、全日成交四十四萬股、茲將道瓊斯紐約指數列下、</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗花晨跌午回</h3>
<p>紗市始跌後漲、形勢漸現堅昂、以大批籌碼物均被某多頭收進、暫時關閉不放、據市塲言、紗布倉中至本月底截止、共計一萬三千餘包、有十分之八九在多頭手中、所以標紗陣勢業已倒掛、此種情形、比較不利賣方、</p>
<p>金難形勢倘穩</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因外棉均微現疲頹之勢、塲中賣氣尤熾、人心懈怠、但大戶之多額、仍無舉動、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌六·七·八角、午後開盤仍平、拍至二三盤、突然趨昂、檯面忽緊、因現紗銷塲活潑、各方均現興奮之象、兼之某多頭意態十分安靜、空頭活動抵補、各月均見上升、結果比上午收盤價漲六·七·八角、查賣出大孚一千包、元一八百包、永大五百包、通記四百包、愼昌二千包、長豐五百包、買進賡豐一千二百五十包、瑞大五百包、長餘四百五十包、長豐六百包、信誠九百包、愼記五百五十包、顧大五百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市晨跌午漲、市氣尚現盤旋、因空頭拋出之額太多、惟某公司亦拋賣不絕、市盤壓力尚重、但午後聞銀價雖猛升、然金市收盤價反較上日爲高、於是獲利者扒空、市盤轉漲矣、</p>
<p>鄭標徘徊帶堅</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一致下落、且大孚又來拋賣甚巨、市塲人心、多以銀價報長、金市下降、美棉跌五磅音、印棉漲跌互見、有〇二五羅比上下、故塲面甚爲渙散、結果各月均比上日收盤價跌一角至二角、午後開盤、市勢突然轉漲、買風尤激、因聞上午金市收盤價比上日反漲六七元、浮空抵補、市盤愈拍愈聚、結果各月比上午收盤價漲一角半至三角、查賣出大孚六千七百担、振大一千二百担、益昶一千六百担、長豐三千担、潤康一千二百担、永大一千二百担、　大一千九百担、均昶一千七百担生源一千七百担、信誠一千一百担、買進合興三千三百祖、明德一千一百担、均昶一千四百拒、生源一千六百担、益康一千三百担、益豐二千三百担、長和三千担、長豐一千一百担、潤康二千六百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>海外棉市上落甚微</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况平平、各月漲跌一至六磅音、旋以同業買進現、貨基礎堅俏、東北氣候報告、棉田之準備工作、暫告停頓、市價又趨上峯、午後多頭了結、重復下游、將收盤時、有一部份空戶抵補、略形堅穩、結果現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌一至五磅音、英棉市况堅穩、現貨漲五點、期貨跌一點、印棉因日商賣出及利物浦電訊不佳而疲、計平果爾漲〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·七五羅比、自羅溪跌〇·二五羅比、原電錄左、（二十六日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　期粉疲軟麩皮平靜</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈先穩後疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近小四分、遠好四八分不等、坎拿大好八分左右、當開價時、以洋麥報價平穩、小廠方面、曾有抵補、故近期開價、雖未上落、遠期則好一分外、迨至二盤後、因洋麥無加稅之舉、巳見昨日之電訊、是以人心復疲、多頭逐見回出、較開價小去一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份因交割已近、雙方從事了結、出入甚少、遠期以買戶不振、仍見略疲、惟春雨滂沱、春熟未免受損、後步升沉、與晴雨實有關係也、結果本月份較小半分、四月份小二厘半、五六月份各小一分、七月份小七厘半、八月份小一二厘半、</p>
<p>麩皮市面、日來平靜、昨以內地帮去胃尚暢、各廠喊價、略好一二分不等、開二元五角六七分、至東莊仍見停頓、去化不旺、後步如銷塲較活、尚看微好、</p>
<h3>期麥絕少生氣</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面大致呈平靜之象、以洋麥報價祇有近角出入、當開價時、以本月份已經過去、聞此番交割數量、約計十二車、因大批貨品、均事前抽去配廠也、至七八月份之市氣、亦見平平、以新麥年收、目下難以沽定、此後之洋麥變化、又難捉摸、故買賣雙方、均無神可用、市面遂少生氣也、結果七月份小二分、八月份小一分、現麥因廠胃未動、未有做開云、</p>
<p>（海外）美政府宣佈春麥之耕種面積可增加百分之七十五、不得漫無限制、西南狀况不佳、此爲價格得以維持之原因、市面狹小、有盤旋之勢</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥　廿五日　二十六日上落</p>

<h3>河下米高定中疲　—洋米內銷仍暢—</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源因風阻見稀、祗到十餘號、（貨共二千餘石）本街銷場亦因天雨交易清淡、致市色復呈平疲、後雖包　有處海衛烟臺等幫採取一千餘包、但終以客家見機扳緊吃盤嚴可，無所見效，故結果各厚粳河薄稻等價高者定而次疲近角、社尖及陰元等各花色悉現垂軟、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日天時陰濕、河下各路到船不多、祗有十餘號、市上各種去胃平淡市價白粳早市價小近角、晚市價形轉定、薄稻價小數分、嘉善早稻價短角外、其餘各貨價帶軟勢、</p>
<p>（洋米）加稅之說已經平息、長江帮祗有運裝存米、並無新交易問津、故市面似有平下之趨勢、儋內地去胃復旺、浙路接續付裝外、滬寗路之無錫常州南京各埠均有問津、統市售開四責暹羅小紋各米一萬二千包、客秈機糙各米內地胃口亦活、辦去糙紅各米二千五百包、行情由疲轉站、人心亦居堅定云、</p>
<p>（黃豆）依然缺乏上漲力、實因人心薄弱、銷塲平淡、故市氣勢少發展、昨共計做開穎州豆一車、價爲三元六角五角、亳州豆二車、價爲三元四角七八分、全河豆二百六十包、價爲三元六角半、歸德豆四百包、價爲三元六角八、碭山豆三百餘包、價爲三元六角半、范家屯豆四車、價扯四元一角二、漢口乍豆八百餘包、價自三元五角一至三元二角四、漢口遲豆四百餘包、價爲三元三角二、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油洋莊跌價</h3>
<p>白桐油近兩旬來、風起雲湧、漢市售洋行竟漲至每担四十一二元、惟價格太高、易受挫跌、至昨得漢電、謂洋莊桐油巳跌至三十九元、大漲之後、理宜小挫、刻下洋行需貨尚股、故現雖見貶、或有回上之可能、</p>
<h3>五金　靑鉛漲風重起</h3>
<p>青鉛近來現貨忽見　缺、而客帮及廠家胃口漸見蠕動、海外定價亦逐步高翔、是以市情十分緊張、人心奇好、致標凖重見漲風、每担行情已由十三元七角半、陡升至十四元二角半、聞交易有四五百條、係法租界一帶五金號開出、惟市上流通貨十分單薄、所以趨勢異常良好、因此開價方面頗覺樂觀也云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （田舍翁）</p>
<p>人們的性，萬有不同：孟子說是性善；苟子說是性惡；告子漆雕開之徒，以爲性無善惡。其實，各有各的理由，很難肯定，我以爲與其言「性」，不如言「慾」。</p>
<p>慾，是人人有的；性未必人人都有吧。處世愈深，天性愈漓；因爲性如淸潔的水，慾如紅的藍的黑的墨汁，注入水中，那有不變色之理。無以名之，名之日「祉會性」。—便是慾—</p>
<p>冷眼瞧社會上的事，都沒有理性的。共同的焦點，都在一個「慾」字；當然囉，一個人的腦海裏，都滿充了「慾」，那裏談得到「性」呢！</p>
<p>禽獸有性嗎？犬馬效忠，慈烏知孝，這似夫禽獸也有天性。人呢，只知有我，不知有人；只知名利，不知忠孝；膠膠擾擾，逐臭附膻，天性早已失却，所存者，只是橫亘胸中的無數「邪慾」吧了！那裏及得來禽獸！</p>
<h3>樂得鑽圈</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>人生何必苦精明，得且糊塗爲佳耳！糊塗人未必定比精明人吃虧多少，但看，也有一種人，那一事那一處瞞得他過，他却有時還故意裝糊塗咧。世上旣有懂得「不痴不聾，不作阿家翁」的人，可見糊塗蟲中儘多有是精靈鬼化身的呢！</p>
<p>有一次，和程小靑君閒談，談出這後邊一種意義：</p>
<p>人做圈，我鑽之。彼見我之鑽其圈也，再來一個，候我一鑽而再鑽之；我不之鑽可也。彼見我之不再鑽其圈也，必不以爲異，當自咎其此圈之或做得不妙，抑以爲此特我（鑽圈者）偶然失之耳：蓋我之肯鑽其圈，已足取彼之信矣！大抵，大圈勿鑽，亦勿彰其眞相；—這就是裝糊塗的妙諦—小圈鑽之可，—所係僅也。</p>
<p>這眞是處世哲學的上乘！大家不必見圈便怕，不過這圈值得不值得鑽，應該預先考慮一下；不然，要是你鑽進一個大圈，那時可別見怪啊！</p>
<h3>送殯記</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>昨天，我去參與一門親戚的殯禮。那二位孤哀子的哭泣盡哀，儀仗的鬧忙繁盛，眞令人羨煞了。這位新近駕返瑤池的老太太，不知是幾生修到的這麼二位賢兒郎。</p>
<p>但是在送殯的途中，我是和一位六十餘歲的世伯母同車，車兒是給一匹旣老且瘦的馬兒拉着，在行列中，緩緩的前進着，於是那位世伯母，便開始和我談起這位已故的老太太臨終時的一切。</p>
<p>伊說：「我這位表姊，你不要瞧着伊那二個兒子的樣兒，以爲生前是滿福氣的，殊不知伊的那二位賢郎對待伊，還不如旁人呢。</p>
<p>「上了年紀的人，總比年靑人經濟些，衣服舊了，也不肯換新的，卽使破了，壞了，都捨不得丟掉，自然，伊瞧着兒子媳婦，把錢亂花亂使，不免的常得哆嗦上幾句，於是兒子媳婦們，把伊恨得甚麼似的，常望伊早些歸天。</p>
<p>「在上個月裏，伊吃了一些已經酸腐的東西，腹瀉得厲害。兒子媳婦們，只作不知道。後來，病重了，我去探視，伊淌着淚，說兒子媳婦說伊愛錢如命的，所以不給伊請大夫診視。</p>
<p>「這麼病了半個月，已是躺在牀上，不能動彈了，才算請大夫瞧了一次。接着，伊便死了。哼，待伊咽了氣，兒子媳婦便都孝得甚麼似的，就只一口壽器，已值得五六百塊錢。你瞧，今天的那個樣兒，誰不嘖嘖地贊着兒子的孝，艷羨着老太太的福氣呢」？</p>
<p>我聽伊這麼一說，心中便不自覺的有些惘然了。</p>
<h3>火塲之營救</h3>
<p>— 作</p>
<h3>名山先生贈書募賑記</h3>
<p>— 網庵</p>
<p>常州錢名山先生，爲遜淸名進士，垂老著作等身，翰墨流傳，得者寶同拱璧。客歲凶荒，百年來所未有，江南被災之烈，無過於溧陽宜興，兩縣飢民麕集常州，流亡載道，慘不忍覩。名山先生以江湖閑散之身，具裘廈蒼黎之想，見之惻然心傷，遂與同人設局施濟，自冬至春，未嘗間斷一日。茲以籌欵不敷，如湯沃雪，特來海上，借七浦路無錫旅滬同鄕會贈書募賑，期限五日，昨爲第一天，記者曾往參觀。先生八法。蓋得力於北碑，而蒼勁古茂，元氣淋漓，又非能以北碑範圍之者，是以求墨妙者踵相接。先生來滬途中，口占災民絕句四首，書之屏條，辭意悽惻，不啻一幅流民圖，於此可見先生之懷抱矣。詩錄如下：破棉敗絮掩胸膺，雪宿霜棲凍不勝，誰似周王營百堵，神州何事不中興。雪後桃花照眼明，菜畦亦復吐黃英，來鴻竟是無歸思，愁看春郊寸麥靑。瑣尾流離幾斷魂，繪圖誰倩鄭監門，同胞直是淸平話，欲喚橫渠起九原。病婦懷中食乳嬰，朝來街尾走皇亭，流民未合爲詩料，老淚淸宵濕管城。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>書畫與裝潢（下）</h3>
<p>— 吟秋</p>
<p>綾絹之顏色，昔時盛行淡月白淡月牙諸色，今則有紫醬，有墨靑，有白銅，有印白，有米色等；通常多用白色，大抵舊書畫用淺色，新書畫則不妨配以深色也。錦邊之裝，不甚美觀，有卍字錦六角錦等，一則太暗，一則太俗，反不若綾絹之爲佳也。</p>
<p>扇面尺面，雖有裱成屛幅者中，而為保藏計，當裝裱成冊，底面配以夾板，銀杏最上，楠木太輕，紅木太重也。手卷之包首，多用舊錦，其引首則用冷金　，或陳宣紙均可。楹聯屏幅上端之帶，每用古銅色，或黃色，一得潮氣，耶易脫色，不若用純白之潔凈。質之柔軟，絲勝於紗；形之妥貼，圓不及扁。繩圈多用銅條，亦有用金銀以示華貴者，圈眼宜小，圈脚宜轉。平軸兩端之包頭，以舊錦爲佳，卍錦次之，不可用紙也。</p>
<p>舊裝名卷，用紙邊，至今不脫，冊頁亦皆紙挖紙鑲，經久耐用。今人競尚綾絹，不數年即脫，可謂華而不實矣。</p>
<p>裝被書畫，最好在夏令伏中，所謂「伏裱」。霉令太潮，秋令太燥，冬令則漿糊易凍，均不甚宜。若能於裱時貼壁稍久，漿性乾透，則亦無妨。上壁下壁，與氣候亦有關係，上壁宜潮，取其滋潤；下壁宜燥，可使平伏。</p>
<p>相傳裝裱之糊，用花椒水和白麵而成，每早必攪一次，用時略加　末，可免霉蠢。或云治糊須經霉過，取去霉面，然後和水用之，則以後不致再霉，但眞照此法者，不多見耳。裱手卷冊頁，最好用白芨折邊，雖紙裱亦耐久不脫。</p>
<p>凡名貴書畫之用兩層紙者，付裝時須加注意，因裱工之狡者，往往私將底層揭去，用以圖利，而首層遂致失神，不可不防也！</p>
<p>書畫在上壁時，必加「覆背」，「覆背」極爲重要，宜用純綿料紙，與原心合成一片，今有用竹料者，惟洋連及油光紙，萬不可用。</p>
<p>「安軸」「上桿」，「上貼」「黏　」，均宜注意，「安軸」用秔米　子，搗爛如膠，勝於洋攀。「上桿」用糊宜勻，使乾後卷之，否則全幅易成波浪起伏之病。「上貼」以鯽魚背式爲佳，「黏　」之長短，以近圈繩處爲宜，過長過短，皆非也。</p>
<p>北方每喜用三色綾，分段鑲嵌裱者，價值甚昂，而其制實俗。最可笑者，且有在上端裱嵌二帶，作下垂狀，謂之「驚燕」，以爲考究，更不知其妙在何處也。近時有用市靑紙洒金，以代綾絹者，初裱時尚可，稍經風化，即須變色，不耐久用耳。</p>
<p>綾有花紋，絹則素凈，花紋有時花，有仿古，各有妙處。我友陶君冷月，則定製冷月圖案，別成一格，亦如吳君似蘭之以婆　花色染綾裱畫也。</p>
<p>書畫有不裝卷軸而配以木架者，紅太紫檀楠木均可，但配架時，亦必先經托裱，或鑲嵌綾絹，然後上架，方可伏貼美觀。架有用玻璃者，有不用玻璃者，不用玻璃者，久掛易舊；用玻璃者，須背縫密切，勿使漏裂，否則潮氣透入，一着玻璃，便有水漬。總之，配架之畫，不若卷軸之能卷舒，便携帶，易保存也。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因此，我對於宮中各業藝工的工作槪况，和他們的生活狀態，知道得再詳細沒有了，要是好好地寫起來，先是縫工的一門，便可以寫着很厚的一冊：至於宮中的繅絲業，（並不包括育蠶）那是寫起來資料更豐富了：就是那專給太后製造鳳鞋的一業，範圍總算是最小的了，但也不難有一冊單行本。</p>
<p>現在就讓我格外從簡的把他們寫一些出來。</p>
<p>『快隨我們一起來吧！」某一日的早上，太后向我說道：「你不是還不曾見過製絲的種種手續嗎？這是很好看的！今天，我又要給你增添一些新的見識了！你試想那些春蠶犧牲了它們的生命，吐出了這樣神奇可愛的絲來之後，我們更將怎樣去處置這些絲呢？要明白這一點，可不是你所能憑空想像的，必須跟着我們去實地觀察！」</p>
<p>太后當日向我所說的話，自然不是這樣的；其中所引用的名詞，在那時侯也許還不曾有咧！這是我現在就記憶所得的原意，自己重新構造的；不過我可以說我構造得已不甚相像了，太后說的話往往異樣的動人，充滿着使聽的人發生同情的魔力，這是我絕對學不像的。就拿這件小事來做譬喻：我對於做絲的一工藝，原沒有什麼特殊的興趣，但經伊那樣一說，我便立卽欣然而起了。（二七九）</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺八</p>
<p>大家都少不得研究研究，這東西由那裏來的呢？日子久了，壞人不用着引？就跟上了路。好的也是越看越紅眼，一引就來。起初，大槪也不想做生意，只不過弄兩個錢，裝束裝束罷了。可是一上了鈎，那就擺脫不了。說到這裏，聲音低了一低，走過來，和賈多才隔了卓面坐着很沉着的道：就是這班茶房老爺，他就不會饒過他們。若是長得好看些的，更要拉攏。窮的女孩子，禁不住銀錢來勾引他，來一回就可以弄幾塊錢，有什麼不願幹？很好的姑娘，就爲了想麼登，走上這條路。我說的那安徽女孩子，就是跑小西天裏面的最紅一個。人家就和他起了個名字，呌飯店皇后。一有了皇后的名字，這就不由他了，茶房差不多天天去找他。十幾歲的孩子，那裏受得住這遭踏，我看，他似乎有病了。我和他談過話，他說這是很苦的，已經幹了一年這下流事情，想不幹了，可是牽連的關係太多，不容他不幹了。賈多才道：他這樣大幹，難道他家庭不知道嗎？浣花道：他穿得那樣摩登，家裏怎能不知道呢？以先家裏未必願他們小姐幹這樣的事。無如小姐回家去，總可以帶幾塊錢來。家裏窮了多年了，救窮要緊，只好隨他去。到了現在，聽說他父母也有些後悔，可是鴉片烟癮已經很大，不讓小姐出來，鴉片土就不能進大門，而且他搽脂抹粉，天天在外面跑，總有點壞名聲，就是讓他嫁人，也不容易嫁出去。只好一天換一天向下過。（一六八）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論「手頭字」</h3>
<p>— 巴山</p>
<p>近來市上雜誌附有「手頭字」第一期字彙者很多，看看那些「手頭字」，似乎和敎育部要到上海來鑄銅模的簡筆字差不多。筆者日昨因談別字問題提到「手頭宇」，以爲這些「手頭字」裏頭有的並不通俗，連我們已經識了好多字的人都不認得，覺得已經識了好多字還要去認這些別十，並不合理，不敢贊同，而情願從根本改革上去認拉了化文字。後來經與朋友們談起這問題，朋友中有的認爲我們現在認別字，所吃苦頭很小，—卽是說認別字在我們已經識字的人是容易的事，爲了普及敎育剷除文盲，我們就是吃這點苦頭亦是應該的。同時又有朋友對於提倡簡筆字感到十分興趣，他不但擁護簡筆字，而且很主張提倡用簡之又簡的草書。我本來就並不反對「手頭字」的，經了朋友們的談論，覺得他們說的確實有道理了。</p>
<p>考查古人對於文字，亦在刪繁就簡，李斯提倡小篆以後，文字已經容易寫得很多，到了晋朝，草書一出，筆劃簡少達到極端，可惜後來反而開倒車寫起正楷的眞書來。如今「手頭字」第一期字彙中的簡筆字，都是從正楷的眞書遞嬗變化而來者，雖然比較正楷的眞書簡便得多，但是比較草書却麻煩得很了。我覺得如今爲着簡便起見，還是以草爲宜。卽是說，旣然要改革文字，以求簡便，索性禁止眞書而用草書。</p>
<p>而且，「推行手頭字綠起」說，「我們日常有許多便當的字，手頭上大家都這麼寫，可是書本上並不這麼印。識一個字須得認兩種以上的形體，何等不便。現在我們主張把手頭字用到印刷上去，省掉讓書人記憶幾種字體的麻煩，使得文字比較容易識，容易寫，更能够普及到大衆。」可是，照第一期的字彙看來，我們「讀書人」的「手頭字」却有好多並不同牠一樣。我們的「手頭字」是有好多是草書呵。比如「爲」字，「好」字，「書」字，「手」字，「可」字，「如」字，等等，我們「讀書人」的「手頭字」就是草書。不但光是我們「讀書人」而已，一般的商人店員工人的識字者，亦大多數是應用着那幾個草書的「手頭字」。旣然爲了免除「識一個字須得認兩種以上的形體」的「不便」，而用「手頭字」，那末，我們的草書「手頭字」便不應該不用在印刷上去了。假如，照第一期字彙說來，我們「讀書人」的「手頭字」有的是草書，用到印刷上却又是簡筆的別字，那末，我們「讀書人」還不是合如今印眞書一樣的不便麼？我們認爲第一期字彙是不徹底的工作。</p>
<p>有人說草書與眞書形體不同，印刷上草書眞書並用，形體不統一，不好看，亦難印，假如推行「手頭字」諸公不用草書的「手頭字」，本意便是如此，那末，爲了統一起見，我們主張來一個徹底的辦法，推行草書才對。以誠懇的態度，貢獻於推行「手頭字」諸公之前，不知以爲然否？</p>
<h3>流落</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>全沒曾想到會來蟄伏在這大都會的一角的一間終日看不見陽光的陰闇的閣樓上，過着好像被世人忘記，也忘記了世人的如屋子一樣凄凉的蝸牛生活。</p>
<p>經常爲了要省吃，沒有別的法兒，只有用着更長的睡覺的時間來抵抗肚子的飢餓，因此每天總是要睡到午後才醒轉來，草草吃了點東西，天便黑了。算是又馬虎的過了一天。</p>
<p>房租拖欠到自己亦覺得太不成話了。每天早上，我聽見娘姨在敲着房門，我裝做睡着，不去理。可是到了要出去的時候總是逃不了那難堪的塲面。</p>
<p>房東那老女人一瞥見了便喊着，另後擺出一很難看的嘴臉：</p>
<p>——先生，請你快點付房錢，已經過月了。</p>
<p>——過幾天付給你，別擔心呢。</p>
<p>每次，我祇好這樣含糊地支唔過去過了幾天又幾天，已經不知挨過了多少個幾天了。這其問房東隨之催迫得更緊，臉孔亦更鐵靑，從前和緩的表情已不再浮現在她縐皮的面龐上了。</p>
<p>最後，她不客氣地，下了逐客令了：</p>
<p>——喂，你如果沒有錢交房租，你就搬塲，過去的房錢我寧願犧牲，好讓我們另外出租。</p>
<p>這句話也幾不知說過幾多遍了。我自己幾乎聽都怕聽。可是呌我住到馬路邊麼。我只有賴着厚臉皮住下去。和忍受着房東一家人鄙薄的眼光和尖刺似的無形有形的譏嘲，到了此時，我是沒有去計較這些明顯的奚落，甚至於侮辱的必要的。</p>
<p>溜了出來，輕鬆了口氣，在路上蹌跟着。我垂着頭瞧着地面，很稀罕抬起腦袋去瞥瞥從身邊擦過去的陌生人的冷酷的臉孔。因爲人們看了我蓬着一頭長長的有幾個月沒剃過的頭髮，以及一身骯髒的衣衫，準會疑心到我是一個不良之流的人，而預防似的各掃着兇狠猛的眼睛不住地注視着我。</p>
<p>對於這樣因失業而來的種種潦倒落拓的苦痛，我用着項大的勇氣去推磨，並不灰心。因爲我明白跟自己處於同樣困厄的狀態下或是受着更大的壓迫的同命運者也許不只自己一人。</p>
<p>而使我感到有幾分憤怨和悲哀的是人與人間冷漠的情感，在起初，尚時常有一些朋友上我的家來探視我，後來便逐漸地疏遠了，疏遠到全行隔絕了。此刻已經久久的日子不見再有誰來。有時候在路上逢着那個朋友，我明白地看出對方是瞧見了我，可是他却馬上把視綫移開去，或者碰見了鬼似的忽忽轉了路避走。爲什麼那樣怕着我呢？是不是跟我這麼一個人接近就會辱歿了你的身份，還是怕倒霉傳到自己身上去？</p>
<p>我沒有別的感想。祇有深深省悟於橫在這前邊的一重厚馬的友情的膜。</p>
<p>爲着要避免房東的迫逼，晚上，長長是在更闌以後才悄悄地回家。在未到了回去的時侯而又無處可走的中間，一些冷僻的街便作爲我唯一的消磨的地方了，在寂靜的冷落的冬之深夜裏，我頂着單薄的破棉袍子，邁着迅速的步子，寒述雖然刀割似的不停地吹婦着，但因爲走得快，倒不覺冷，反而從身上生了點煖意。聞若風吹打着兩旁高叢梧桐，偶然一兩片葉子由頭上落下來，不禁對自己的生命典起零落的悲愁，這時周遭是寂然一無聲息。只有我的輕細的脚步聲混着凄戚的業子的搖響，灌滿了浪浪者欲抖的心窩。天上還有迷濛的月色照印出了我影子，我便載着悲楚的混合奏再一路繼續走去。</p>
<h3>稻草人</h3>
<p>— 方之中</p>
<p>新採來的松枝刺刺地在火爐中燃起驅寒的光焰，照在公公銀色的鬚髪上。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>貢臘的面孔上：凝滯地，而又和藹地的公公儘是抽着旱烟，兩隻臉，巴子一鼓一鼓地借够勁兒，似乎忘記了每晚在這時講故事的責任，似乎不曾瞧見坐在兩旁的孫子們期待得淌下口水那模樣。</p>
<p>「公公！怎麼還不開始講」？一個年紀約摸十來歲的癩皮頭等得實在不耐煩，首先提出來質問。</p>
<p>「飯都沒有吃了，還講故事！這麼大的孩子，眞像糊塗虫兒」，</p>
<p>公公瞅了癩皮一眼，仍一鼓一鼓地抽着烟，松枝火一晃一晃的，就和孫子們期待的眼一樣。對面坐的見子出來說情了：「孩子們險得什麼，你老人家就講一點啦」！</p>
<p>最小的一個瞧見了父親也在聲援，便一溜烟跑到公公身邊，扭着他的手要他講，臉子儘在他衣袖上捱，待到公公轉眼一瞧，衣袖上已結滿了發光的鼻涕。</p>
<p>「你去坐，你去坐，我來講」！公公揮着手。他才回到坐位上。</p>
<p>「有兩戶人家是對面住着的」。公公咳了一聲。「就假定是張李二家罷。這兩家本是世仇，都要想法子報復。有一年吃過了年夜飯，張家便紮了一個稻草人，把牠盡成靑面獠牙，像一個惡鬼，右手拿一根木棍，左手拿一把笆扇，啊咤，啊咤，…」公公述咳了幾聲，急得孫子們感覺痰這樣會搗亂，獺皮便天喊起來：</p>
<p>「爸爸；快倒茶來！快倒茶來」！</p>
<p>公公喝了一口茶，不咳了。孫子們又催起來：「嗯，嗯、靑面獠牙，拿一把笆扇，嗯，嗯，後來呢」？</p>
<p>「他兒子問他這是什麼人，他說：</p>
<p>「這是瘟生，手要拿的是訃棍，這是要死人的，這把笆扇是掃財的，把這個瘟生送給了李家，李家就會死人退財」。</p>
<p>他兒子又問他什麼時候送去，他說：</p>
<p>「開財門的時候送去」。並且叮囑見子道：「把瘟生送到李家門口，你要這樣說：財門大打開，瘟生滾進來：乖乖嚨的冬，死人又退財」。</p>
<p>兒子牢牢記住了，並且也照樣的作了。後來李家一打開財門，稻草人便袞在門前的地上，李家的兒子連忙大呌着這是什麽，李家的大人便欣喜地，從容地說：</p>
<p>「這是財神書薩：這根棍是金棍，這把笆扇是驅邪的」。</p>
<p>李家拜跪畢，又把稻草人送回張家。張家是故意把開財門的時候延遲的，這可糟了，財門一開，稻草人又滾在他的門口，他兒子便大聲把那套話唸起來：「財門大打開，瘟生滾進來；乖乖嚨的冬，死人又退財」！</p>
<p>他父親急得一面頓足，一面掩住他見子的嘴。……」</p>
<p>全火爐邊的人哄然大笑起來，孫子們笑得涎沬和眼淚交流，拜天拜地的：公公也笑得咳嗽在一團。過了好一會，最小的一個孫子，把笑得掛在嘴唇的鼻涕用舌子一絞便問公公；</p>
<p>「後來李家發了財嗎？死人退財還是張家哪」！</p>
<p>公公彷彿威到不舒適，把旱烟袋向墻壁上一扔：「從前的事不大淸楚，不過假如是現在這年頭發什麼財，發棺材！至於死人退財，那倒是常事！……去問問你媽：沒吃完的藥湯還有沒有？…我肚子餓得很」！</p>

<p>縹渺香閨慘淡雲。絳珠仙子返園林。他是靈河石畔靈芝草。深感神瑛侍者恩。一片痴心酬夙願。報恩特地下凡塵。那知赤繩誤綰他人足。已負前生萬種情。却爲那別鵠離鸞兩地分。因此上生難離病到瀟湘館。舉目皆如仇敵形。有誰人向我床前問一聲。痴魂無定隨風去。遇着那南海慈航觀世音。說道草木尚然知報德。道是無情却有心。返魂有術今調停。遊魂仍向榮寗府。虛飄飄轉眼入園林。老祖宗物故家零落。昔年姊妹半凋零。寶玉不知何處去。怡紅院裏草靑靑。行來咫尺瀟湘館。昔日琅玕還帶淚痕。竹影蕭　不見人。值日功曹遵法旨。黃金力士駕祥雲。吒咜一聲魂入壳。拍靈床哭出了斷腸聲。兩府榮寗盡吃驚。公然劈破棺材蓋。報說林姑已再生。重了人間未了姻。</p>

<h3>如果你是生來害羞的請看凱倫穆蘭的榜樣</h3>
<p>— 斐斐</p>
<p>爲什麼做電影明星的，不用他們父母給他們的眞實名字，而要用自己選擇的假名字？或是因爲自己本來的名字太長了，不甚響亮，不易記憶，不够伶人的風味。但是還不盡然如此。譬如有一個名字，亦不太長，亦很順口，亦很够維曼諦克的風味，容易被人家記憶，但是他或她，還一定是改換名字，到底是什麼道理？</p>
<p>我們就拿凱倫穆蘭（Karen　Morley）來說，她的原名是密德麗林頓（MildredLinton。那個名字旣簡短，又響亮，又够優伶的風味，容易被人家認識，但是她却一定要換她現在的名字。那是什麼道理呢？</p>
<p>原來換名字的，除了要簡短，響亮，順口，够味，以及容易記憶之外還有其他兩個很大的理由。其一，她要那名字隱含着一種異國情調，別緻的風味。於是她就從她喜歡讀的一本小說中，尋到了這個別緻的名字「凱倫」。「穆蘭」是一位名作家的筆名，亦是她很崇拜的，於是她亦就備了來。但是那還不是眞實的理由。那更重要眞實的一個理由，就是她要戴上一個假面具。因爲她自己本來是很膽怯的，她用了一個假名字之後，就好像戴了一個假而具，不怕別人認出來了。</p>
<p>凡是做優伶的，如果不化妝，不在臉上加了一層厚厚的汕漆，就不會表演，但是如果在臉上加了一層厚厚的油漆，就膿大起來，表演得亦隨心所欲了。這是凡有些舞台經騐的，都知道的。爲什麼？就因爲那層厚厚的油漆，遮蓋住了他們的羞恥的原故。大凡舞台優伶，或是電影演員之所以要採用假名字，大半亦就是爲了這個原因。他們因爲怕親戚朋友將他們認識出來，所以就用了假名。等到有了經驗，成了名，他們的假名亦就傳了出去，而眞名反而隱秘起來了。</p>
<p>文人之所以要用筆法，亦是這個原因。他們起初做文章，還沒有自信之心，恐怕寫得不好，被認識的人知道，就用了假名。等到久而久之，亦就筆名傳了出去，而眞姓名反而隱秘起來了。</p>
<p>凱倫穆蘭亦是如此。她生性是最怕羞的人。她怕到影片公司去報名，怕去請求事情做，怕人家取笑她。但是她用了假名之後，卻以爲人家不認識她，而膽大起來了。她現在在銀幕上表演的，都是些反派角色，强盜婆，女竊，壞女子，淫蕩婦入等等。當她在開米拉前面來演的時候，她可以做盡各種陰險女子的派頭，但是等到鏡頭轉向別處，燈光一熄，她立卽就恢復了原狀，見了人羞答答的頭都不敢抬高。因爲她是一位生怕膽怯怕羞的人。</p>
<p>凱倫穆蘭是生來膽法害羞的。她在學校的時候，她就不敢到外面去交朋友的。她從學校出來之後，就躱在家裏看書。她雖然從小有作演員的空想，並且亦曾加入過學校裏的戲劇班，但是她祗會搬搬佈景，從來沒有一次敢登台表演過，因爲她害羞的原故。等到她進了大學，更不放有作演員的空想，而想去學醫了。</p>
<p>但是她後來想到了隱藏她眞姓名的方法。果然，自從密德麗林頓變成了凱倫穆蘭之後，她遮住了她的害羞之心，而什麼事都敢做了。這不是很奇怪的一件事嗎？但是亦不算奇怪。如果你生牲是膽怯害羞的，你可以試一試凱倫穆蘭的方法，看興不興。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「海底尋金」</h3>
<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>Below　The　Sea　—大光明</p>
<p>舊觀念糾纏着劇作老的創作方法，使他在這裏來一個善惡果報的故事。在大戰時，德國潛艇的艦長，爲了要日後打撈海底的三百萬沉金，謀財害命的殺死了船副，這便大傷了陰德，所以十五年之後，他雖然用種種欺騙方法撈若了沉金，結果自己葬身魚腹，而沉金亦重落海底。另一方面，水手麥琪，雖然也利慾薰心的企圖得着這沉金之一半，不過他却見義勇爲的救了他人的性命，所以他雖然沒有得着那非分之財，到底得着了富家女郎的愛情，以後便過着幸一福的生活了。</p>
<p>這樣的故事、自然很難於引起人們的興趣。雖然懲惡揚善，未嘗不是劇作者闈道的用心，可是人們是不會在一個近於童話似的非現實的故事中滿足的。沉金已被撈出水面，恰好箱底就在這時候破裂，多麼的凑巧啊！</p>
<p>也許人們對於那大海中狂風大浪的塲面，會覺省驚駭。也許人們對於那富家小姐和麥琪之間的打情駡俏，會覺得輕鬆。但是結果祗是個別的存在，這些並不能使整個的劇獲得緊張刺戟的效果。而那打情駡俏的秤種，更是十分牽强的硬凑上去，不免使人厭煩，這種生硬的戀愛糾紛，我們在美國影片中眞是看得太膩了。</p>
<p>的確，北較可取的是大海中暴風雨的塲而，那確是很難於攝製的。但這並不是說攝影有着極好的成續，假使整個的檢討攝影，也不過是庸俗無奇的。至於其巾五彩的一段，我們可以將其當作博物敎材來看，可是在此劇中揷入，却不免顯着生硬痕迹的。至於海底的種種，除了看到潛水機的上下，或鱆魚的姿態之外，也沒有什麼更驚異的表現的。</p>
<p>比較可取得是主人公施模（德歷廷艦長），並沒有被描寫成失去了人性的人，卽是說他並不是在臉上表現出千惡不赦的惡人，Fredrik　Vogeding担任這一角色，他是給與我們眞實戚的，這未嘗不是比較技術的地方。此外沒有什麼特別可取之處了。</p>
<h3>小郞却耐出現了！</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>經過了三年間的激爭，新的郎却耐終於出現於銀幕上了！</p>
<p>郎却耐—這萬世不朽的銀壇上的名優，到底有誰能够承繼他的藝術上的地位呢？原來這新的郎却耐就是他的兒子克雷頓却耐（Ceeighton　Chaney）</p>
<p>三年前克雷頓曾决定拿自己的名字出現於銀幕，可是製片家們堅持一定要他用父親的名字，然而他拒絕了，坦白地聲明他還沒有資格承繼他父親的盛名。</p>
<p>有五六家公司都願意和他訂合同，祗要他肯用他父親的名字。後來他終於屆服了，答應了他們。不過須另放「小「字於「郎却耐」之上。</p>
<p>「我終於讓步了」克雷頓這樣地對記者說：「爲了生活，爲了妻和兩個孩子的生活問題」。</p>
<p>「三年工夫我曾爲我的主義奮鬥，那就是我想不靠我父親的名氣，用自己的力量出現於銀幕，可是畢竟終歸於失敗，並且爲了生活，再亦不允許我堅持我的主張了。</p>
<p>「現在我已換了名字，成功自然是很有把握的了。我已經和一家公司訂好了三年的長期合同，每年拍八部片子。</p>
<p>「這就是說，在這三年中我可以得到很多的有價值的經騐，過了這三年後，我想來試試父親幹過的那種角色。我並不想，亦不能拿他的地位取而代之。的確，這是沒有人能够幹得到的，不過我總想盡我的力量而已」。</p>
<h3>胡蝶在莫斯科</h3>
<p>胡蝶女士，在中國的電影演員中，大概可說是最受人注目的一個了。自然，她有絕頂藝術天才，而更重要的，就是她虛懷若谷，肯用功。這次她和周君劍雲受了蘇聯國際電影展覽會的邀請，遠往莫斯科，去觀光這世界新興國家的藝術界現狀。她們到了蘇俄以後，蘇聯政府公報和伊斯維斯太報評論中國電影女明星胡蝶女士抵蘇的意義，對她盛加讚譽，稱之爲有可驚的天才的有名明星。並謂：「胡女士之抵此，乃欲研究蘇聯電影，以及蘇聯各導演與演員的工作，彼留此兩星期，即將赴列寗格拉研究」云。</p>

<h3>印度亡國恨（Clive　Of　India）（十二）</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>他正在對着那一片汪洋的大河悵望之際，他忽然想起了他口袋中的一封信。他連忙抽了出來，拆開讀着。上面寫的是；「勞伯特，他們都說你好冒險——那是於我們大家都有危險的……但是，勞伯特，不管他們說什麼，你儘管做去。祗要你相信，我是無有不可的。我但爲你的勝利祈禱而已」。克萊夫讀完了，吸了一口深長的氣。他忽然將自己的腰仲伸直，自己駡着自己道：「怯膽的懦夫，你的膽量反而不如一個婦人女子了」！</p>
<p>正在這個時候，帳門外面狂風大作，突然間天昏地暗起來。艾德蒙狂喊道：「勞伯特，信風來了！潮水來了！雨來了」！克萊夫很機械的應了一聲：「雨來了」。他的絕高的希望，不覺又矮了下去。現在已經無法先和密爾耶法通信息了。他又看看他手裏握着的那對信，自己和自己說着道：「她已經叫我照着我相信的做去了」！他突然跳起來喊道：「惠爾許！隊長！拆帳篷，吹號排隊—李安，你將大砲槓出來！輕裝速進，不帶行李！河邊會齊！立即渡河，立即渡河」！</p>
<p>歷史的一頁，又被一個匹夫之勇迭成了。柏拉賽的一戰，薩拉烏特都拉大敗。卡爾喀答的仇亦復了。克萊夫將漢奸密爾耶法扶上了印度的王位。英國人樹立了這個愧儡，一般商人的氣焰，陡然高入云天。法國人在印度的地位，亦就此一蹶不振了。密爾耶法爲感恩報德起見，將皇室的珍寶珠玉，儘量地奉獻於克萊夫的麾下，克萊夫爲了要討好於他的夫人起見，亦就慨然地收了下來。這樣，他們夫妻二人又綑綑紮紮，回到故鄕英國來。</p>
<p>克萊夫的重回英國，已是富而目貴了。他已晉封爲柏拉賽男爵而稱爲克萊夫勳爵大人了。他在華爾各脫造了一座富捋王侯的男爵府邸。在那府邸四週，購置—幾百畝一望無際的草地，上面種了許多花草樹木。他們夫婦二人，於是就悠游林下，忘記了戰爭的凶險，殺戮的慘酷，居然賦了遂初之頤，享盡田園之樂了。他們並且已又添了兩個孩子，補償了幾年以前喪明之痛。但是在瑪格勒蒂，却一生不能忘記爲印度而受的犧牲。她始終不願再提到印度二字。</p>
<p>但是人事反覆無常，克萊夫等正在安居樂業，妻兒環繞之巾，南天一角，却又起了暗澹的風雲。過了多少年，密爾耶法已被一位印度的新君推倒，而那位新君！却比從前的薩拉烏拉都拉還要兇殘，並目對於英人仇視甚深。因此，英國人在印度的地位，又見搖動起來，而印度總督畢各德又想起克萊夫，要請他東山再起。</p>
<p>但是這個時候的克萊夫，旣富且貴之後，已無從前亡命時的銳氣。他並且在國會中佔得一席之地，久在功成業就，家居樂逸之中，怎能再向瑪格勒蒂重提起「印度」兩個字呢？但是總督畢各德却情詞懇摯的勸着駕，告訴他，說現在一般人，都缺少膽量，遇事畏葸，因循貽誤，坐失時機，以致他千創之業，勢將被他人送掉了。克萊夫給畢各德一稱頌，一恿慫，不覺見獵心喜，故技復癢起來。但是瑪格勒蒂腹中還懷着他一塊肉，他怎樣和她開口呢？（未完）</p>

<h3>Hu Yuanhui Telegraphed to Report on the Situation of Dyke Inspection; Li Yizhi Withdraws His Resignation</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Hu Yuanhui telegraphed from Daming, reporting the results of the inspection of the Taihang Dike.

<h3>Wang Jizong, Head of the Illegal People's Militia in Yutian, Arrested in Fengrun; The Area Around Ya Hongqiao Town Has Been Cleared; Zhou Yuying's Troops Enter to Check Household Registration; Yin Rugeng and Others Arrive at Xiadian from Yutian</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Early on the 26th, Zhou Yuying's troops launched a fierce attack on Wang Jizong's militia in Qianjiagou. The militia relied on the power of mortars and stubbornly resisted. By 9:00 AM, the fierce battle had lasted for six hours. The militia suffered many casualties. The remaining troops were unable to withstand the attack and scattered towards Zhaojiapu and Lijiaqiao. The security team took advantage of the victory to pursue. The bandits led by Jia Wenge and others also could not defend the area around Zhaoqiaopu's Liu Guitang bandits and fled towards the Yanshangkou border. The militia and security teams of Ji and Zun were intercepting them and are already surrounding them, and a resolution is imminent. More than 300 people from Wang Jizong's troops have been captured and disarmed and sent to the Yutian County Government for interrogation. Currently, traffic in Yutian has not been restored and the entire county is still under martial law. The security team's defenses have not been relaxed. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Jizong, the head of the illegal militia in Yutian, was defeated on the 26th and his troops scattered. Wang disguised himself and fled to Fengrun, intending to enter Tangshan and seek refuge with foreigners. He was captured by the local police of Xinjuntun Town in Fengrun County and handed over to Zhou Yuying's army on the morning of the 27th. A team of soldiers was dispatched to send him to Yutian County for temporary detention. After the military operation ends, he will be sent to the Ping Military Sub-Committee. When Wang arrived in Yutian, he was tightly bound but showed no fear. Wang is from the third district of Yutian, 37 years old, courtesy name Chengzhu, graduated from Fengrun Middle School, and studied at Tianjin Law and Politics School. He once served as a teacher at Changli School. After his capture, some of his troops fled in several directions. The four counties of Feng, Ji, Zun, and Qian are blocking the escape routes. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Three hundred militiamen from Baoju County rushed to Siliwow, the sixth district on the border between Yutian and Bao counties, on the 26th to guard against Wang Jizong's defeated militia from Yutian. Wang Zhanyuan's security team from Zunhua and Fan Jinghe's security team from Ji County arrived at the Yanshangkou border on the 26th to guard the area. The militias of various counties have established dense defenses. The illegal militias in Ya Hongqiao and Lin Nancang towns have been cleared. Zhou Yuying's security team entered on the afternoon of the 26th to check household registrations and search for rebels. Order in the city has not been restored and traffic is still cut off. The villages and towns in the third, seventh, and eighth districts of Yutian County are full of fleeing militiamen. Zhou Yuying's security team is assisting various legitimate militias and police teams to search and clear the area in several directions. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The gentry in the third district of Yutian came forward to plead with Zhou Yuying to allow Wang Jizong's troops to surrender their weapons and be dismissed without excessive pursuit. Zhou has agreed. Traffic between Yutian and Tangshan will resume on the 27th. Long-distance buses detour to Lin Nancang to reach the county seat, protected by the security team each time. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At around 11:00 AM on the 26th, Yin Rugeng, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, Yi Wo, and senior staff officer Omaki of the Tianjin Japanese Army arrived in Yutian in four cars to meet with Zhou Yuying, the commander of the regiment, and Zhao Congyi, the magistrate of Yutian County, to discuss the aftermath of the county. At noon on the 27th, Yin and others left Yutian and took cars to Tongxian's Xiadian Yanjiao to inspect the security supplementary team led by Li Yunsheng and monitor the reduction of troops. The first squadron of Sun Yucheng's security supplementary team led by Shi Zhensheng looted Caotingqiao, the border between Yutian and Tongxian, causing extremely heavy losses to more than a hundred shops. The team is entrenched locally and refuses to move west to the new defenses of Yanjiao. Shi is the nephew of Shi Yousan and recently received a secret letter from Shi, so he is disobeying the reorganization. Currently, the shops in Caoting are closed, allowing the team to trample on them. (Special dispatch from the 27th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations Takes Effect</h3>
<p>— A Commentary</p>
<p>Japan's announcement of its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27, 1933, has reached the end of its two-year period of treaty obligations after withdrawing from the League. According to the League of Nations Covenant, from today onwards, Japan is completely unrelated to the League of Nations both legally and practically. In other words, all of Japan's actions in East Asia can no longer be interfered with by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The League of Nations is a hollow and disorganized entity whose power could not prevent the deterioration of the Far East situation since the September 18th Incident. Therefore, Japan's withdrawal has a very limited impact on our country. We do not wish to discuss this in detail here, but only to mention the changes in the overall situation in East Asia over the past two years.</p>
<p>When Japan first announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, the world believed that the moral sanctions based on the treaty had lost their final effectiveness, and all international treaties maintaining vested interests were also shaken. The international situation was quite serious. Japan was also aware that this move was indeed against the moral principles of the world. Therefore, before withdrawing, it conducted repeated research, and after the withdrawal statement was issued, its attitude was as moderate as possible, fearing that the powers would take unified steps to respond.</p>
<p>Since Hirota took office as Foreign Minister, he has made every effort to break the isolated diplomatic situation. He temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards China policy and tried to avoid conflicts in diplomacy with Europe and the United States. At the same time, he also used economic policies to supplement the inadequacy of diplomacy. In the past two years, Japanese diplomacy has always been in a favorable position. In terms of its active aspects, the "Four-One-Seven Statement" on monopolizing East Asia was boldly published, and the demand for equal defense rights was successively put forward. In addition to looking at each other in dismay and launching a competition to build warships, the various countries have not heard of any other effective response methods. The more complex the international environment, the more the Japanese diplomatic skills can be used to take advantage of the opportunity. Past events can be easily repeated.</p>
<p>Now that Japan has completely broken away from its relationship with the League of Nations, international treaties outside the League of Nations Covenant, such as the Nine-Power Treaty, are no longer binding. The Washington Naval Treaty has been declared abolished, and Japan's statements, such as the declaration that it will never return the South Pacific mandated islands to the League of Nations, and its unwillingness to change its attitude of monopolizing East Asia, are even more evident. Japan is doing whatever it wants, deepening the tension in East Asia. This is what we should deeply recognize today when Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations takes full effect.</p>
<p>Although the current East Asian situation is extremely complex, we do not need to be pessimistic. Although Japan is no longer bound by the League of Nations Covenant, it cannot be in a detached position and live alone, and the position of monopolizing East Asia cannot be achieved by easy power. In the future, we must work together to seek the self-reliant survival of the nation, not be discouraged, not rely on foreign forces, and not worry about the dangerous environment. The whole country must be inspired and strive for self-preservation. This is what we should strive for after deep understanding.</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi to Return to Japan Next Month; Consular Conference in China to be Convened in Mid-April; Comprehensive Opinions on China to be Conveyed Upon Return to Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an order has been issued instructing Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, to return to Japan in late April to report in detail on the situation in China and establish a concrete policy toward China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also instructed Ambassador Ariyoshi to convene a consular conference in Shanghai in mid-April, inviting Japanese consuls stationed in various parts of China to learn about the situation in various places and listen to the opinions of the consuls, so as to obtain comprehensive opinions to bring to Tokyo and make important suggestions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<h3>Japanese Navy Declares: Determined to Maintain Control of Mandated Islands with Force; The United States is Not Likely to Raise This Issue Recently; Believes Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations has No Impact on the Political Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan has completely withdrawn from the League of Nations today. The Japanese Navy's attitude towards the South Pacific mandated islands remains firmly unchanged. The South Pacific mandated islands were occupied by the Japanese Navy during the European War, as a result of victory, and were placed under Japanese rule after consultation with friendly countries. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to give them up, and there is no reason to give them up. If an enemy uses a corner of the South Pacific islands as a base to gradually extend its poisonous hands towards the Japanese mainland, the entire navy facing the Pacific Ocean will be attacked from the flanks. Even if the naval power is superior to the enemy, it is still difficult to ensure the safety of the coastal defense. Moreover, if the military strength is inferior to the enemy, it will be even more difficult. Therefore, if for any reason, there is an attempt to seize the South Pacific islands from Japan, Japan's countermeasures are very simple, in other words, to deal with it with force. (Dentsu dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japan's formal break with the League of Nations today will probably have no impact politically. High-level sources here believe that this move by Japan indicates that it is becoming more nationalistic. The only thing related to the United States is the issue of the Pacific mandated islands. However, reliable sources believe that this issue is not important at present. Although the United States also claims the right to dispose of the former German islands, the United States may not insist on this right. Therefore, from all aspects, the United States will not raise the issue of Japan's mandated islands recently. It is generally believed here that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations may symbolize that it is deeply convinced that its own naval and land forces are sufficient to cope with other countries, so its actions are even more independent. Japan's recent abolition of the Washington Treaty and its advocacy of the Asian Monroe Doctrine are all the same trends. Observers believe that this policy may not change the peaceful atmosphere in the Pacific in recent years, but at least it has increased unstable elements. Official sources have stated that they will continue to cooperate with Japan on Far Eastern issues, especially on naval issues and the open-door policy in China. Although the United States itself is not a member of the League of Nations, it has gradually adopted a policy of international cooperation, while Japan is moving in the opposite direction. For example, when the Philippines wanted to give preferential treatment to American goods, the State Department expressed its opposition. It is believed here that this is an indication that the United States does not want to provoke Japan's dissatisfaction. Business circles have also repeatedly asserted that the Japanese market is very important to the United States. (Kokumin dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, commented today on Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations taking effect from tomorrow, saying that the League of Nations' life has suffered another fatal blow. Senator Borah said, "I am not surprised by Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, because any major country whose interests conflict with the League of Nations has never respected the League of Nations." (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times stated in today's editorial that it is the first time that a major country has ceased to be a member of the League of Nations because it has not fulfilled the resolutions of the League of Nations, which is seen in Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. It is now questionable whether it is appropriate to no longer be a member of the League of Nations and still participate in the work of the League of Nations without being bound by the obligations of the League of Nations. What is undoubtedly possible is that a compromise will be established in the future, and Japan's cooperation will be maintained in the non-political services provided by the League of Nations in Nanjing. Japan should know that the machinery of the League of Nations cannot work without the fuel supplied by the national treasury. The Daily Telegraph reported that after Japan's proposal to add immigration laws to the scope of the League of Nations administration was rejected by the League of Nations, Japan's significance in the League of Nations had decreased. When Japan's Far Eastern policy was criticized, Japan justified itself and said, "Since the rejection of Japanese immigrants is an internal policy of other countries and cannot be interfered with by the League of Nations, why shouldn't Japan's actions to seek a way out for its overpopulation also be regarded as a private matter for Japan and not be interfered with by the League of Nations?" (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) France regrets the most that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations takes effect today. There are two reasons for this: first, France has always expressed sympathy for Japan; second, France's consistent policy has been to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations. Therefore, French politicians felt that the League of Nations had suffered a major blow when Japan announced its withdrawal two years ago. Germany's subsequent withdrawal was also inevitably influenced by Japan's precedent. In the past two years, France has repeatedly tried to get Germany and Japan to return to the League of Nations, but hope for Japan has been dashed, while progress is still being made with Germany. However, if the negotiations with Germany can yield results, Japan may be able to reconsider. (Kokumin dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany expresses the most sympathy for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. There have been expressions of approval for Japan's attitude here, because Germany also declared its withdrawal on November 14, 1933. However, Germany still has room for consideration now and is currently discussing with various countries, so it has not yet formally declared that it agrees with Japan's views. However, Germany has in fact no goodwill towards the League of Nations. Political circles believe that the League of Nations is only an executive organ of the Treaty of Versailles. As for the Far Eastern issue, German public opinion generally adheres to neutrality, but believes that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is very pleasing. (Kokumin dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Avenol's Remarks Severely Criticized by Our Representative, Deemed to Conflict with the League Covenant</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Geneva Japanese Consul General Yokota today published an article to reporters, saying that although Japan has now withdrawn, the League of Nations cannot ignore Japan's superior position in the Far East, and Japan cannot ignore the League of Nations as the most important organ in beneficial social work, so both sides will maintain a contact, but not as direct as before. Japan will continue to participate in the League of Nations' humanitarian work. Yokota mentioned the islands entrusted in the Pacific Ocean, saying that the Japanese government will continue to submit annual reports to the League of Nations. Chinese Minister to Switzerland, Hu Shize, today spoke out to severely criticize the remarks made yesterday by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol regarding Japan's formal withdrawal from the League of Nations, saying that the Secretary-General's remarks were contradictory, had not been approved by the Executive Yuan or the General Assembly, and conflicted with Article 1 of the League Covenant.

<h3>Japan Discovers Large Deposits of Water Lead Ore, an Important Raw Material for Manufacturing Steel</h3>
<p>China United News Agency, Osaka Correspondence: Two members of the Matsue City Council, Nozaki and Fukushima, recently discovered a large deposit of water lead ore between Sasebo and Tamayu Village, with very rich content. According to expert chemical tests, the content ranges from 60% to 70%. They have now submitted an application to the Mining Bureau for approval to start mining immediately. Water lead is an important raw material for manufacturing refined steel, and domestic production in Japan is particularly lacking. Now that the military industry is booming, the discovery of the water lead ore has attracted the attention of the military and industrial circles.</p>
<h3>Japan Issues Public Bonds: 370 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government originally planned to issue 477 million yuan in public bonds by the end of this year, but due to an increase in government revenue of 100 million yuan, the amount of public bonds issued has also been reduced by 100 million yuan. The bonds will be issued by the Department of Budget and the Bank of Japan on the 30th. (Japan United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>British North Borneo Plans to Build Airfields</h3>
<p>Singapore: Six sites have now been selected in British North Borneo for the construction of airfields to plan for the opening of air services between Singapore, Borneo, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. This may connect with the Pacific air services planned by the United States, taking the route of Honolulu, Wake Island, Tokyo, and Shanghai. Colonel Dunlop, Director of Public Works of the British Aviation Department, returned here today and said that he strongly approves of the newly selected locations. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>US Senate Resolves to Award 2 Million Yuan to Encourage Pacific Aviation</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed an additional provision to the 90 million yuan Treasury Department Postal Service supply bill, stipulating the award of 2 million yuan to encourage the opening of American-Asian air routes. Proposer Magardo declared that the case would allow the United States to reach Dalian in just four days. The American Airlines plane, the "Oriental Skylark," was forced to return to Miami due to engine problems while flying to San Francisco, but will still fly to San Francisco tomorrow.

<h3>Sir Victor Sassoon Announces Plan to Rescue China's Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai: Sir Victor Sassoon issued a statement to Reuters today, outlining his plan to alleviate the financial tension in China, especially in Shanghai. Sir Victor Sassoon suggested that China seek a sterling loan and use it as collateral to issue "Shanghai Pound Bonds," which would be equivalent to sterling and would circulate in the market together with Shanghai silver dollars as a supplementary or alternative currency. According to Sir Victor Sassoon's plan, these pound bonds could be delivered in London for sterling, obtained from a special committee, or obtained in Shanghai for Shanghai silver dollars at the sterling exchange rate. If necessary, the Municipal Council may find ways to supply a smaller amount of substitute currency. Sir Victor Sassoon believes that China still needs to maintain its silver standard. The current financial crisis was caused by the US silver purchase policy, which can now be considered a failure. China, especially Shanghai, must find ways to overcome this difficulty until the United States abandons its current silver purchase policy. He believes that the United States will eventually abandon its silver purchase policy. If China uses inflationary methods to expand its currency, it will cause great harm. However, if it expands its currency in a prudent manner, it can immediately reap its benefits. In his opinion, these pound bonds have many uses, such as the payment of customs duties and the purchase and sale of imported goods, which can avoid the current exchange risks. Furthermore, this new currency is more suitable for storage than local currency, so the local currency can circulate in the market as a result. This compound currency can be cancelled when the United States changes its policy or when other factors occur that can help China escape its current difficulties. Sir Victor Sassoon believes that the existence of local pound bonds can make sterling loans possible, so that the structure of local credit can be expanded without the need for currency inflation.</p>
<p>(London) Reuters News Agency learned today that Sir Victor Sassoon's plan to alleviate China's financial tension is in fact in line with the approach that several London financiers have recently been considering. The intention of these financiers is that China lacks cash, and the future status of the gold group is uncertain, so it is impossible to fully adopt the gold standard. As for lending money to China to purchase silver and transporting the silver back to China, it is also useless, because China has increased its purchase of silver, and the United States continues to drive up the price of silver, which will make the current situation even worse. However, London's borrowing can enable China to adopt Sir Victor Sassoon's plan, so that local gold pound notes can be used for various broad purposes. When the price of silver rises, China can sell it and reinvest it in gold pound lending, thereby opening up a path to connect with the gold pound. Belgium and Switzerland seem to be doing the same. As for China retaining sufficient silver for domestic use, it does not seem to be too difficult. Some observers are now opposed to restoring the new currency on top of the old currency, as this move will only make the situation more confusing. They also stated that the problem cannot be solved until the United States announces its final will on silver. Reuters News Agency learned that negotiations are currently underway in London to provide economic assistance to China. It is generally believed that the United States is not participating in these negotiations, but France is very concerned about this move. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Silver Industry Convention to Consider Silver Policy; Held in Washington in Early April</h3>
<p>(Washington) The National Silver Industry Federation will hold a convention in Washington on April 5th and 6th to crystallize opinions on silver. The federation's president, Allen, stated today that a method of inflation is clearly not far off. Although gold prices have almost doubled in the past two years, there is still insufficient gold to support the currency needed by the public. The purpose of the convention is to seek the interests of the silver industry, but he believes that a free and thorough discussion of the silver issue should be conducted from a national standpoint. The federation has invited members of Congress from the silver faction to attend and participate in the discussion. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(New York) The U.S. Treasury Department purchases domestically mined silver at a price of 64.5 cents per ounce. Currently, the price of silver abroad is not far from this price. If the price of silver abroad exceeds the domestic price, how will the United States cope with it? This is a question recently discussed on Wall Street. Some predict that the government will issue another nationalization order. Since the first nationalization order on August 9, 1934, all silver imported into the United States has been nationalized. Others say that there is currently pressure in Washington to reduce the value of silver dollars at the same ratio as gold dollars, increasing the value of pure silver to $2.189 per ounce and simultaneously issuing more banknotes backed by silver reserves. However, if the price of silver abroad continues to rise, the authorities will soon have to decide whether to abolish the policy of subsidizing domestic silver producers. If members of Congress from the silver faction oppose the abolition, the government will continue its current policy, as it is widely known that silver faction senators insist that the Treasury Department pay a higher price for domestic silver than for foreign silver. The authorities increasing the subsidized silver price does not require the passage of a legislative bill, but it is generally felt that the government will find it difficult to either set a higher price or decide to abolish this policy. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(New York) The Treasury Department has now purchased a total of 342,060,000 ounces of silver, of which 31,079,000 ounces are newly mined, 112,581,000 ounces were purchased under the nationalization order, and 198,400,000 ounces were purchased under the Silver Purchase Act. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News stated in today's editorial that the rise of speculation in the silver market is due to the amendment proposed by U.S. Democratic Senator Thomas to issue silver certificates backed by the silver purchased by the U.S. authorities, as speculators expect this amendment to be passed, and the government will actively purchase silver. However, whether this amendment can be passed by Congress and the President is uncertain. Even if the amendment is passed, it does not necessarily mean that the government will increase its purchase of silver. Even if President Roosevelt yields to the pressure of the inflation faction and does not veto this amendment, he will still strive to limit its impact and will not purchase more silver. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 186 to 78, rejected the Senate's amendment to President Roosevelt's $4.88 billion work relief bill and sent the bill to a joint conference committee of the two houses. This is another blow to the silver faction in Congress. The joint conference committee may delete the amendment proposed by Senator Thomas. This amendment advocates inflation and the issuance of $375 million in additional currency, using four methods: (1) The Treasury Department would issue silver certificates backed by existing or future silver bullion, with the value of the silver calculated at $1.29 per ounce. These silver certificates could be used to pay off maturing debts, allowing them to circulate immediately in the market. (2) These silver certificates must be made to circulate; the Treasury Department should reissue them after receiving them. (3) and (4) authorize the Treasury Department to discretionarily issue silver certificates backed by silver received from other countries as payment for gold prices and to accept silver from other countries as payment for debts owed to the United States according to a fixed price.

<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Eden's Visit to Moscow; Anglo-Russian Talks Particularly Complex; Soviet Attitude Pivotal; Simon Departs Berlin, Flies Back to London</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The entire city of Moscow is now eagerly awaiting the arrival of British Lord Privy Seal Eden tomorrow morning. Eden was in Warsaw today and arrived at the Soviet-Russian border at 8:12 p.m. He will be met by a special welcoming committee, including Soviet-Russian affairs expert Weinberg. The public is paying close attention to Eden's visit to Russia, as this trip seems to be more complex than the trip to Berlin, because the Soviet Union can influence the talks in the German capital. It is widely believed that Eden will raise various questions to Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov regarding the results of his meeting with Hitler. The Soviet authorities have taken extremely strict precautions to prevent accidents during the journey from Berlin to Moscow. A police officer guards Eden day and night. According to a Reuters reporter traveling with the party, anyone who wants to enter the compartment where Eden and others are staying is carefully questioned. Soviet-Russian Ambassador to London Maisky is also returning to the country on the same train. He stays in a compartment a few doors away from Eden and frequently enters Eden's compartment for informal talks. According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, British Foreign Secretary Simon flew back to London at 10:00 a.m. today, with a brief stop in Amsterdam for lunch. He will be able to fly to London tonight. Before his departure, German Foreign Minister Neurath, British Ambassador Phipps, and various officials from the embassy came to the airfield to see him off. Hitler sent his special guard to the field, who presented arms in salute when Simon entered the plane. Before his departure, Simon met with the French Ambassador and the Chargé d'Affaires, but the nature of the conversation was not revealed. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The official farewell ceremony for British Foreign Secretary Simon's departure from Berlin for London was the same as when he arrived in Berlin last Saturday. British Foreign Secretary Simon first bid farewell to British Ambassador Phipps at 9:20 a.m. this morning. German Foreign Minister Neurath then arrived at the Andron Hotel at 9:40 a.m. and accompanied Foreign Secretary Simon to the Berlin airfield. The Imperial Airways' giant airliner "Tria" was ready for departure. Hitler's personal guard was still at the field to protect and see him off. Hitler's representatives and British and German dignitaries also came to the field to see him off. Simon shook hands with the dignitaries, expressing his earnest feelings. The plane took off with the British Foreign Secretary on board and flew back to London at exactly 10:00 a.m. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>British Officials Indicate the Trip Was Worthwhile</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Anglo-German talks ended last night without any formal agreement. However, British Foreign Secretary Simon and other British representatives did not appear disappointed and believed that the trip was worthwhile. The second step now is the meetings of Lord Privy Seal Eden in Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague. The British, French, and Italian governments will then reconvene. People today hope that the British report on the Anglo-German talks will clear the air and allow the Allied powers to decide on the actions to be taken. During the Anglo-German talks, Germany made frank expressions. According to the Associated Press, citing reliable sources, the scope of the talks was very broad, including issues such as security, armaments, air force treaties, and returning to the League of Nations. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Discrepancies in Opinions Have Clarified the Crux of the Matter</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is reported that Simon and Eden are very satisfied with the outcome of this talks. Before Simon departed for Berlin, he had stated in the House of Commons that the trip was purely exploratory, so there was no question of compromise. What can be said now is that the British and German governments have used this meeting to thoroughly clarify each other's points of view. During the discussion, there were obvious discrepancies in opinions, but because of the discrepancies in opinions, their location is now clear, so this meeting can be said to have achieved its desired purpose.</p>
<p>This trip by Simon and Eden was not only desired by the public, but also had to be made due to previous events. It was not just the recent joint communique between Britain and France. Although the British government has a responsibility to protest Germany's unilateral actions to strengthen its military, if the points raised in the Anglo-French communique can be used for discussion one day, then Britain still has a legitimate reason to make this invitation. It is said that this view of Simon and Eden is now recognized by all parties. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Details of the Discussion Remain Shrouded in Secrecy</p>
<p>Few details of the discussion have been revealed, especially by the British side. However, Hitler's position is that Germany is willing to do as other countries do and support the work of European appeasement, provided that other countries can freely advocate plans aimed at establishing peace in Europe and give Germany the lead. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>German Chancellery Hosts Guests</p>
<p>(Berlin) Tonight, Hitler entertained the British representatives in his private room in the Chancellery. A total of 50 British and German officials attended the banquet, including British Ambassador to Berlin Phipps, German Foreign Minister Neurath, German Disarmament Envoy General Ribbentrop, Prussian Prime Minister and Air Force General Goering, and Propaganda Minister Goebbels.

<h3>Memel Trial; German People Outraged; Autonomy System Shaken</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the military court in the Lithuanian capital tried the case of the National Socialist Party in the Memel region and handed down severe sentences, according to a report from the German News Agency, residents of Königsberg in East Prussia, upon hearing the news, rose up to express their opposition, marched in groups, and shouted "Down with the shameful Lithuanian judiciary" and "Demand justice for our German compatriots in the Memel region." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "Official Correspondence of the National Socialist Party" commented on the verdict of the Lithuanian military court in the Memel National Socialist Party case, saying, "This action is a provocation on the part of Lithuania. If the great powers responsible for guaranteeing the autonomy system of Memel do not want Memel to repeat its mistakes, they should not remain silent and should take measures to warn others. In short, Lithuania is not qualified to exercise sovereignty over the people of Memel. We should now find a way to rescue Memel from the fire and water." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) According to The Times, Britain, France, and Italy, in their capacity as signatories to the Memel Autonomy Convention, jointly notified the Lithuanian government on March 13, stating that the three countries are responsible for maintaining the Memel Convention. However, judging from the verdict in this case against German residents, it can be seen that the actions of the three countries have not had any effect. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Liberal "Manchester Guardian" published a commentary today stating, "Although the current system in the Memel region should be maintained for some time, it should not remain unchanged for too long. Many Western European political principles cannot be applied to Eastern Europe. For example, the recent election in the Free City of Danzig, where the National Socialist Party will inevitably resort to terrorism, is one example. The current system in the Memel region is not only fragile but also lacks flexibility, so it cannot eliminate ethnic and national conflicts between Lithuania and Germany. It can be seen that changes must be made in Eastern Europe. Not only must the Memel political system be changed, but so must other things." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Commentary from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Daily said that if no disputes occur in the future, there is clear evidence of good results. Another newspaper said that if the work in Berlin can continue with the same sincerity in the future, then even if opinions still differ today, there is no need to be discouraged. However, the opinions of French newspapers all believe that the result of the talks was negative. Le Figaro said that Germany's animosity towards Russia was a clear result of the talks. The newspaper does not believe that the Soviet army can harm Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Worry About the Future of the European Situation</h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers are slightly critical of the Berlin talks, generally saying that Germany has closed the door to the Eastern European Pact and made the future of disarmament even gloomier. The Daily Telegraph, based on a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent regarding Hitler's various strong demands, said that British cabinet members are now encountering a more stubborn attitude than they expected. The National Socialist Party's apprehension and hatred of Red Russia is a major obstacle to clarifying the European situation. The Morning Post said that people in London are now pessimistic about the Berlin talks, fearing that Germany will soon be isolated and that France, Russia, and other countries will form a powerful group to resist demands for treaty revision. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Consider the Talks a Failure</h3>
<p>(Paris) Le Matin expressed disappointment at yesterday's Berlin communique (continued on page 7)</p>
<h3>End of Berlin Talks; Germany Puts Forward Five Demands; Conditions for Returning to the League of Nations; Anti-Russian and Annexation of Austria Are Unwavering; Air Force on Par with Britain, Navy Superior to France; Revision of Eastern Borders, Abolition of the Polish Corridor</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to the Berlin correspondent of the British Daily Telegraph, Hitler made the following demands during the Anglo-German talks:</p>
<p>(1) The German Air Force should be on par with the British Air Force, with the standard determined by the standard of the Soviet Air Force. (2) Germany has the right to build a navy of 400,000 tons, which is twice the total tonnage of the French Navy as stipulated by the Washington Treaty. (3) Abolish the "Polish Corridor" so that German East Prussia is connected to mainland Germany, and also issue a declaration stating that Germany's eastern borders are not immutable. (4) Revise the borders of Czechoslovakia so that the land inhabited by 3.5 million Germans in Czechoslovakia is annexed to Germany. (5) Annex Austria. Hitler also stated that if the above demands are met, Germany is prepared to return to the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the official details of the demands made by Germany during the Anglo-German Berlin talks will not be known until Foreign Secretary Simon returns to the country and submits a report, according to semi-official sources, the content of Germany's demands is largely consistent with what is reported by the Daily Telegraph. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The talks between the British and German cabinet members ended last night. All the issues included in the London Declaration of February 3 by Britain and France, namely (1) concluding a general disarmament convention to replace the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, (2) Germany's return to the League of Nations, (3) Germany's participation in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact and the Danube Non-Interference Pact, and (4) the conclusion of a Sky Mutual Assistance Pact between Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium, were discussed. British Foreign Secretary Simon flew back to Britain this morning, while Lord Privy Seal Eden set off for Moscow as originally planned. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Issuing a Communique</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the talks held between Britain and Germany in Berlin, the German government issued an extremely cautious communique today: "The two-day meeting between Chancellor Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath, and Envoy Ribbentrop and British Foreign Secretary Simon, Lord Privy Seal Eden, and British Ambassador Phipps has ended tonight. The matters discussed at this meeting were based on the points stated in the London Declaration of February 3. Both sides acted with the utmost sincerity and a friendly spirit, so the result is a complete understanding of all the key points. What is now certain is that the purpose of both governments is to enhance international cooperation and to protect and consolidate peace in Europe. The British and German authorities are deeply gratified by the effectiveness of this direct contact." (National Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Disappointment. The semi-official Victory News even directly recognized the Anglo-German talks as a "failure," while the Paris Evening News, the mouthpiece of the French General Staff, labeled them "talks without results." Le Figaro called these talks a "German case against Russia," and the semi-official Le Petit Parisien said that Germany's demands for equality have now turned into demands for superiority over France. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers commented on the outcome of the Berlin talks, considering them to be of a negative nature, but also beneficial, as the communique stated, because British cabinet members could gain a true understanding of the German authorities' true intentions and their lack of a spirit of compromise. Le Figaro said, "Hitler spoke a lot, but not clearly. What was clear was of a negative nature." Le Journal believed that American cabinet members would be disappointed. L'Action said, "British cabinet members believed that the German government had a willingness to compromise, so there was the possibility of discovering a compromise point. This hope has now vanished, but Foreign Secretary Simon will not admit failure and will strive to propose a general disarmament convention at the Stresa Conference. The so-called "compromise solution" is what Germany expects, but it may not be approved by Mussolini and Laval. French people who believe that Franco-Russian rapprochement is unnecessary also advocate adopting a tough policy and quickly organizing a European security system, which is the only way to maintain peace." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Do Not Know How to Blame Themselves</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The government-authorized Diplomatic Political Review published a commentary today entitled "Changing Course," commenting on the Anglo-German meeting, saying that during the first meeting on Monday, Chancellor Hitler explained his foreign policy to the British representatives in detail, clarifying that Germany, like other countries, deeply understands its responsibility for international cooperation and strives to make its rational and important interests consistent with the conditions of international cooperation. If this new reality can gradually replace the prejudice against Germany, then the smooth development of future negotiations can arise from this. It is a pity that Europe has not yet reached this point. All unpleasant situations still want to make Germany bear its responsibility politically and morally. What is the point? (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>Empty Communiques Fail to Gain Trust</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Newspapers here have commented on the Berlin talks between British and German representatives. The "Daily News" stated, "Hitler's remarks about the threat of communism have a fiery taste. Who would believe that this is intended to draw closer to Germany?" The New Free Press stated, "The responsibility of the Stresa Conference and the people involved is extremely great. The future of Europe will be decided at this conference in the next few years." The Vienna News stated, "The emptiness of the content of the communiques issued by international politicians is second to none this time. Even the most optimistic person in the world cannot find the smallest degree of confidence." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>French Foreign Minister's Speech; Urges Germany to Participate in Collective Peace Organization; Three Countries Unite for Common European Security; Germany Should No Longer Adopt a Hesitant and Evasive Attitude; Roman Agreement Passed by the French Senate</h3>
<p>(Paris) During today's Senate debate on the Franco-Italian agreement, Foreign Minister Laval spoke, urging Germany to join other countries in managing peace. Laval said that Germany cannot avoid its obligations indefinitely. This is not a question of obtaining equal rights or returning to the League of Nations based on certain conditions, but of whether Germany is willing to join other countries in organizing peace. After the debate, the Franco-Italian agreement was voted on and passed by a large majority. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate met today to discuss the Franco-Italian agreement signed in Rome on January 7. It was unanimously passed by 285 senators to ratify the agreement. During the discussion of the case, Foreign Minister Laval delivered a speech, first praising Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, saying that at a time when the Treaty of Versailles was being violated by Germany, Italy was able to support the cause of international unity with all its strength and without any reservations, which greatly pleased us. As for the recent rearmament of Germany, the actions of Britain, France, and Italy are completely interconnected. This peaceful and united policy has absolutely no intention of opposing any other country, and the security we demand is also the common security of all countries. Our position has always been the same and has not changed. We have no secrets and no ulterior motives. We seek to ensure that the peace of all countries is guaranteed and that the honor and dignity of all nations are respected. As for the internal political systems of other countries, it is not our concern, and we have no intention of interfering. We should continue to work with all nations and governments to organize collective peace. Although only France and Italy have signed the Roman Agreement, it is completely open. Countries that are currently unwilling to sign can participate at any time in the future. What we want to tell Germany is that Germany should no longer adopt a hesitant and evasive attitude. The so-called equality of armaments rights and the conditions for Germany to return to the League of Nations are no longer an issue. The only question is whether Germany is willing to join other countries in organizing the work of peace. Laval then recounted the enthusiastic situation of the French and German people when the late Foreign Minister Briand visited Berlin in 1931, saying that the feelings of the French people towards Germany are still the same as they were then and have not changed. Finally, Laval argued that France must strengthen its friendly and allied relations with various countries, but at the same time, it must also defend its territory by its own strength. His concluding remarks were, "We must be strong and united so that we can have no worries." (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>France and Italy Shake Hands Sincerely to Defend Against the Threat on the Rhine</h3>
<p>(Paris) France and Italy have shaken hands sincerely to defend against the threat on the Rhine, as the Senate unanimously approved the Franco-Italian agreement recently concluded in Rome yesterday. The agreement stipulates Franco-Italian cooperation in Europe and African colonies. Foreign Minister Laval praised Italian Prime Minister Mussolini during the debate. At the same time, the French government has implemented a ban on the import of military raw materials into Germany. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>If Something Happens in East Africa, Germany Is Willing to Assist Abyssinia; British Government Pays Attention to the Ambassador's Report</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Echo has received news from its London correspondent that the British government is paying close attention to the report submitted by its ambassador to Abyssinia. It is said that when the new German ambassador to Abyssinia, Kirstiermus, presented his credentials on March 18, he declared to the Abyssinian Emperor that if Italy goes to war with Abyssinia, Germany is willing to side with Abyssinia. The ambassador also proposed in the name of the German government to immediately dispatch military instructors and air squadrons to assist Abyssinia. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Sakai City. The Sakai City Ohama Aquarium, known as the best in the Orient, suddenly caught fire carelessly at 10:30 a.m. on the 27th and was completely reduced to ashes. The fire was extinguished at noon. Although the seals and sea lions kept in the aquarium were rescued, the other 60,000 fish were all burned to death. The loss is approximately 200,000 yen. The cause of the fire was due to the ongoing repairs to the house, where the paint on the board wall peeled off and ignited the board wall due to a burst of fire, resulting in a catastrophic fire. (Nichi-Rengo dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Economic Commission Plans to Build a Large Oil Storage Facility in Chongqing</h3>

<h3>The Yellow River Situation is Critical - The Jin Causeway River Water is Rising Continuously - Fan County, etc. are Several Feet Deep</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Yellow River breached its banks in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, two years ago, Shandong Province has been repeatedly affected by disasters due to its downstream location. Recently, the Guantai Koumen breach has not yet been closed, and most of the water flows out from the breach. The water in the main river only accounts for two or three tenths, and there is a tendency for it to dry up and form a new river channel. According to general speculation, the Guanatai breach has repeatedly missed opportunities, and it will be difficult to close if effective methods are not urgently sought. However, since Shandong is located in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the two breaches in Changyuan have caused flooding in the counties north of the Jin Causeway River in Shandong Province, including Pu, Fan, Shou, and Yang. Now, the water from the Guantai breach is still following the old course, flowing eastward along the Jin River and entering the main river at Taochengbu. The Jin Causeway River is now over ten feet deep, and the current is still slow. The affected area in Pu, Fan, and other counties is three to five miles wide and hundreds of miles long. When Changyuan issued a warning last year, the Shandong Provincial Government ordered Pu County, Fan County, Shouzhang County, Yanggu County, Dong'a County, and other counties along the Jin Causeway to build a new levee outside the old civilian levee and south of the Jin Causeway River to prevent flooding. Fortunately, the water flow was very slow at that time, and the counties along the river were able to prepare for it. To this day, the subsidiary levee has been strengthened and thickened by the efforts of the people and is now higher and thicker than before, stretching for hundreds of miles. There is also a small civilian levee in Lianhua Pond in Shouzhang County, north of the Jin Causeway River, so the disaster area has not been expanded. The Yellow River Commission believes that closing the Guantai breach is important, but strengthening the Jin Causeway is even more crucial. It has decided to convene a meeting of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan in Kaifeng on the 28th of this month to discuss strengthening measures. The issues to be discussed will mainly focus on strengthening the Jin Causeway. If the Guantai breach is not closed for a long time, there is a risk that the upper reaches (Hebei) will divert the Yellow River into Tianjin, while Shandong Province will suffer even more. Therefore, Zhang Lianjia, director of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau, before going to Bian to attend the meeting, made a special trip to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Han Fuqu, stating that the Provincial Government had previously decided to allocate 150,000 yuan to subsidize the construction of civilian levees on the south bank of the upper reaches and the north bank of the middle reaches, and it was necessary to quickly advance the funds and start work on time to prevent unforeseen circumstances, and then submit it to the Provincial Government for record. When Zhang went to Bian, he also took a copy of the Jin Causeway cross-section map and a copy of the three provinces' official levee construction plan issued by the Yellow River Commission to discuss everything with the Yellow River Commission.</p>
<p>The official levee construction funds in Shandong Province require more than 6 million yuan from Luokou to the upper border, not to mention those below Luokou. It is expected that there will not be such a large amount of funds at one time. As for the Jin Causeway within Shandong Province, it is still very solid. The water level at Luokou is now above 28 meters, and the situation is still relatively stable. (26th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Hanying Discusses the Yellow River Fundamental Treatment Plan - Strengthening the Jin Causeway Can Be Completed Within Two Months - Plans to Add Eight Hydrological Stations Such as Jinji</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Recently, the Guantai breach closure project has been a serious undertaking. The Central Government has repeatedly sent special envoys to consult with relevant agencies and discuss remedial measures. Now that the peach blossom flood season is approaching, and the water level is gradually rising, the downstream three provinces of river works, if the aftermath is not handled urgently, there is a deep fear that a major flood will come, affecting it greatly. The reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, yesterday. The following is a record of the conversation: Reporter: It is reported that the Central Government plans to ask your commission to be responsible for strengthening the Jin Causeway. I wonder what the current progress is. Mr. Zhang: Our Commission previously received a telegram from the National Economic Commission, stating that the current situation of the breach closure project is urgent. In order to prevent future troubles, the Commission was ordered to expedite the strengthening of the Jin Causeway before the flood season, and the Chairman of the Commission was given the authority to direct the Construction Department of the respective Province, the River Affairs Bureau, and the County Governments in the respective Counties. After receiving the order, the Commission has been expediting the design drawings and tables and will be submitting them to the meeting soon. The Central Government attaches great importance to this project, which is especially important to the downstream. The Commission plans to send technical personnel to the project site to handle it. Work can begin around early April and can be completed within two months. Reporter: Every spring, the downstream three provinces usually have spring repairs. This year, the Yellow River has undergone changes in form due to the Guantai project. In the blink of an eye, the flood season will arrive. Can the various dangerous works along the river be guaranteed to be free from faults? Mr. Zhang: The downstream three provinces usually do spring repair and summer prevention projects before the flood season. However, given the large number of dangerous works in the downstream three provinces, the Commission urgently needs to do revetment and other projects to strengthen them. The Commission previously submitted a request to the National Economic Commission to include 1 million yuan for strengthening the Yellow River dikes in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces in the 23rd year budget for water conservancy projects. It has also drafted a plan and budget within this limit and telegraphed it to the Central Government for the record. This project can be divided into the following items: (1) The Lanfeng Xiaoxin Dike revetment project, which is to prevent the river from changing to its old course, requires about 150,000 yuan. (2) The Qinkou River to Jiubao Twelve Dam revetment project, which is to prevent the river from heading towards Zhangwei, is estimated to require about 150,000 yuan. (3) The strengthening of the south levee from Zhukou to Shili Pu and the silt discharge plan for Huanghuasi are for the settlement of more than a dozen counties in western Shandong. The Huanghuasi section must be strengthened in advance, requiring about 110,000 yuan. (4) The willow branch revetment project for the levee from Dacheji to Shitou Zhuang. This section was newly built last spring, the quality of the work is loose, and it was breached again in the summer, so it is advisable to take urgent precautions, requiring about 100,000 yuan. (5) Connecting and repairing the Huayang Dike. This dike is a barrier for the Shiche section. The breach closure project plan stipulates that it should be repaired to Wulou. Below Wulou, there is a 20-kilometer section to Menggang without a levee, and a large water can overflow, endangering the dike. It must be connected and repaired uniformly, requiring about 200,000 yuan. (Note: The Economic Commission has now telegraphed that this project should be included in the breach closure project for handling.) (6) The Zhongmou Dike revetment project is related to the safety of the Huai River basin, requiring about 100,000 yuan. (7) The management of dangerous works in Liuzhuang and Laoba Tou requires about 100,000 yuan. The Central Government also attaches great importance to the above projects and has planned the funding. The Commission believes that the project is related to the safety of several provinces, and the methods for construction and the division of expenses between the Central Government and local governments need to be consulted. The director of the River Affairs Bureau of the three provinces has been telegraphed to gather at the Commission in Kaifeng on the 28th of this month to discuss everything. Zheng Zhaojing, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the National Economic Commission, will attend to guide the meeting. At the same time, Chairman Li of the Commission will also come to Bian from Shaanxi on the 27th of this month to preside over the meeting and discuss everything thoroughly, in order to start construction as soon as possible. As for other post-disaster projects, some provinces have already planned the funds, and some are still awaiting design. The methods will also be discussed at this meeting so that they can be carried out. Reporter: How is the Yellow River fundamental treatment plan progressing? Mr. Zhang: What I said above are all projects that need to be repaired urgently at present, as a work to save emergencies. If we do not urgently seek to save them, water disasters can come immediately. As for fundamental treatment, it is a century-long plan. Although the effects are slow, the impact is great. For example, the Yellow River's major problem lies in the excessive amount of sediment and the rapid flow of floods. If these problems cannot be solved, the Yellow River will never be treated. To solve this problem, we must seek another way of governance, just as if there is poison in the blood, which causes boils, we must not only treat the boils but also clear the blood. The principle is the same, and sediment and floods both come from the upper reaches, so we must pay special attention to them. The Commission is studying the fundamental treatment plan. In addition to organizing a river survey team and establishing hydrological stations, the site surveys and designs for flood control reservoirs on the Jing, Wei, Qin, and Luo rivers are being carried out step by step. This year, we plan to add eight hydrological stations such as Jinji, Wubao, Wuding River, Yanchuan, Yanchang, Huaxian, Sanchuan River, and Wen River. There are already 200 rain gauge stations. This year, we plan to add more than 120. The Economic Commission has approved the various budgets. As for afforestation in the upper reaches, it is currently under investigation. In short, the Commission attaches great importance to the fundamental treatment plan and is making active and vigorous progress. (25th)</p>

<h3>Bandit Du Jibao Surrenders to the Law</h3>
<p>Du Jibao, age twenty-four, from Di Jing Bridge, Sixth District, has long associated with bandits, engaging in robbery and plunder, committing all sorts of crimes. Last month, he and Xie Alin, Lu Zhengming, Fu Nanquan, and others robbed Tao Xiang Elementary School in the Third District and the home of Shen Xilin in Shangshui Bang. After the crime was discovered, Xie Alin and others were arrested, but Du Jibao fled to Suzhou, evading justice. Recently, hearing that the situation had calmed down, he secretly returned to Wuxi and hid outside the East Gate. On the twenty-second of this month, Du rented a bicycle from Zhang A'da's bicycle shop at No. 2 Tingzi Bridge but never returned it, pawning it at Yuyuan Pawnshop on Guanqian Street for eight yuan and two jiao, which he spent. The other day, Feng Sanda and Gu Gengxing, employees of the bicycle shop, spotted him and reported to the shop owner, who apprehended him and turned him over to the First Sub-Bureau, which then transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Unexpectedly, the bandit had disguised himself as She Jinbao, but the detective team's informant identified him as She Jibao, who had robbed Tao Xiang Elementary School. The bandit then confessed without argument and was transferred to the local branch court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault Occurs Outside Changshu South Gate</h3>
<p>At eleven o'clock on the night of the twenty-fifth, two robbers, both armed with blades, suddenly broke into the home of Gong Liangnan in Huang Er Lou, a rural area outside the South Gate of this city. Without asking questions, they began hacking at those present. His brother, Yong Sheng, had his lower lip slashed. Wang Qiqi, a candy seller who was residing there, and Gong's wife, Wang, were also hacked five or six times, sustaining severe injuries. As a result, the two robbers stole a jacket and several pairs of shorts belonging to the Gong family. The victim has reported the incident to the bureau and requested an investigation. According to general opinion, this does not seem to be a simple robbery; it may be a vendetta. Since the Gong family is not wealthy, and the robbers were only two in number, there is deep suspicion. Unfortunately, it was dark, and the Gong family did not see the robbers' faces, allowing them to escape without a trace.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou: Urban Land Registration Completed</h3>
<p>When Jiangsu Province started handling land registration, it designated Zhenjiang as a pilot area.

The deeds of the nine households that failed to register have been sealed by provincial order. Registration in the urban area also ended on the fifteenth of this month. A small number of households have applied for registration due to special circumstances and have been granted permission to complete the registration retroactively. However, foreign merchants such as Asia Petroleum and Mobil Oil have not yet registered the land they permanently lease in Zhenjiang. The Foreign Affairs Department has sent letters to the European and American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the consulates of the relevant countries in Beijing to handle this issue. The Land Bureau is currently compiling land price and tax registers for submission to the department for approval. The land ownership certificates for each household are also being processed and are expected to be issued at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Land Reclamation Area Water Conservancy to Proceed in Stages</h3>

The area north of Jiaoxie and south of Xinyang Port is designated as the first phase, and the area north of Xinyang Port and south of Chenjiagang is designated as the second phase.</p>
<h3>Petition to Replace Rubber-Coated Light Wires</h3>

<h3>Measures to Revive the Market: Two Organizations Submit to the Ministry of Finance for Implementation. Items One, Four, and Five Can Be Achieved, but the Addition of Land Deeds to the Reserve Has Not Yet Been Approved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, in order to revive the market, formulated five measures and submitted them to the relevant authorities for approval. Three of the five measures are about to be implemented, but the second and third measures have not yet been approved by the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition urging implementation. The original petition stated: "Regarding the request to revive the Shanghai market, which is currently depressed, we have previously formulated five measures as temporary solutions: (1) Bills of exchange from various industries should be discounted by silver shops and banks. If there is adequate security, silver shops and banks should accept them, and the Central Bank should provide rediscounting to silver shops and banks. (2) Title deeds and land ownership certificates should be added as security reserves under the Central Bank's note issuance. (3) Title deeds and land ownership certificates should be added as savings security reserves. (4) Silver shops and banks should continue to provide account books to various stores, but they may adjust the amount of credit overdrafts at their discretion. Stores themselves should also strive to strengthen their organization. (5) If silver shops and banks use goods or real estate as collateral for loans or discount bills at the Central, China, and Communications Banks, these banks should accept them as much as possible." On March 1, we jointly submitted these measures to your ministry for adoption, requested the Central Bank to consult, and instructed the Savings Deposit Security Reserve Committee to comply. We also sent letters to the silver shops and banks, the Central Bank, the China Bank, and the Communications Bank to handle the matter. Currently, within the five measures, the first item regarding the central bank's rediscounting of business acceptance draft launched freely by the silk industry, after consultation, we received a reply recognizing that it would benefit the market and agreeing to handle rediscounting to facilitate turnover. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is requesting the silver shops and banks to draft discounting measures. The fourth item regarding credit loans was supplemented by the two organizations on March 13, by submitting to your ministry four outlines of plans for small industrial and commercial credit loans. The financial sector is now forming a syndicate to prepare for making these loans. The fifth item, that the three banks should accept collateral or discount bills as much as possible, is now being addressed by your ministry's issuance of 100 million yuan in financial bonds for the 24th year, increasing the capital of the three banks, which is intended to prepare for fully undertaking collateralized loans and bill discounting. Therefore, the above three items can be achieved gradually. However, the second item, the addition of land deeds to the Central Bank's note issuance security reserve, and the third item, the addition of land deeds to the savings security reserve, have not been approved since the submission, which occurred over two weeks ago. Land deeds account for a significant portion of the property in this city. Without ways to facilitate circulation, the commercial crisis will be difficult to resolve. We have prepared a document requesting your ministry to review, swiftly adopt and implement these measures, and issue instructions for compliance, which would be in the public interest. We respectfully submit this petition."</p>

<h3>Art Exhibition Preview: Antiquities Display Completed; British Commissioner Perceval Arrives in Shanghai; Opening No Later Than May 8</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the preview exhibition of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art has been postponed several times and is now scheduled to open in early May. The antiques exhibited at the meeting are the most exquisite relics of our country from past dynasties, and they are sufficient to promote our country's inherent culture. There are a total of 1,500 types of bronzes, porcelains, calligraphy and paintings, and silks, all of which are divided into categories with detailed explanations in Chinese and English for the convenience of the audience. The preview exhibition will last approximately 30 to 40 days. Once the exhibition is complete, they will be carefully packed and transported to England for exhibition. It is said that after a year, they will be shipped back to China and exhibited in Beijing once more. Yesterday, the reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Tang Xifen, the secretary of the society, and was told the latest situation, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Banquet for the British Commissioner</p>
<p>Of the four British Commissioners who came to China to select antiques some time ago, Raphael has already gone to Japan. The other three are still staying at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. The other day, another British Commissioner, Perceval, arrived in Shanghai. The society held a banquet at the Meiyuan Restaurant on Fourth Avenue yesterday afternoon to show hospitality and foster goodwill. In addition to the three British Commissioners, those in attendance included Yang Zhensheng, Yuan Tongli, Guo Baochang, Zhang Yuquan, Ye Gongchuo, Wu Hufan, Tang Xifen, and others, totaling more than ten people. The British Commissioners also went to the society in the afternoon to view calligraphy and paintings.</p>
<p>Arrangements Completed</p>
<p>The exhibition hall has been arranged. At the entrance of the Bund, there is a large lounge where books or epigraphic books related to our country's culture will be sold in the future. Bronzes, porcelains, calligraphy, paintings, etc. on the second floor are all displayed in glass cases and surrounded by short railings, so that the audience cannot touch the antiques with their hands. At present, all the antiques have been displayed, but they still need to be arranged. An advance invitation will be sent to various dignitaries to inspect the venue, and reporters from various newspapers will be invited to visit once.</p>
<p>Opening Date Although the opening date has not yet been determined, it will not be delayed until after May 8 (Monday). When the Nanjing Preparatory Committee meets on the 30th, it may be decided to open on the 8th.</p>
<h3>American Pacific Route Scheduled for Test Flight in Early July; Rumors of Flights to Guangzhou Inconsistent with Facts</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the American authorities are actively preparing to open a Pacific route in order to develop the aviation industry. Yesterday, the reporter from the Central News Agency learned from Mr. Dai Enji, the manager of the China Aviation Corporation, that because the American side plans to open this route, the general public mistakenly believes that it is a Sino-American route, which is quite inconsistent with the facts. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Test Flight in July</p>
<p>Countries around the world are vigorously promoting the aviation industry. The United States has planned to open a Pacific route connecting the Asian continent and, after active preparations, has now decided to formally begin test flights in early July this year. The route will start from San Francisco, pass through Honolulu and several small islands in the Pacific Ocean, and reach the Philippines. However, Singapore and Hong Kong, because they are British territories, cannot land there until an agreement has been reached.</p>
<p>No Flights to Guangzhou</p>
<p>The rumor that this is a Sino-American route is even more inconsistent with the facts. Our country's civil aviation is very backward, and we only hope to develop it gradually to maintain it. We will never allow foreigners to occupy our routes. Therefore, the rumor that American Pacific Airlines planes will connect with Guangzhou is not true, because it is our country's territory and concerns sovereignty, so it is difficult to allow in practice.</p>
<h3>Commercial Economic Association Resolved to Issue Circulating Vouchers Yesterday, Appropriately Adjusted to 450 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Shanghai Commercial Economic Association, organized by the real estate industry in this city, held its second full board meeting at Room 10 of the Yizhixiang Western Restaurant on Fourth Avenue at 3:00 PM yesterday, passing resolutions and electing standing directors.</p>
<p>Attendees: Wang Yiting, Cheng Linsheng, Zhou Weishi, Chu Huiseng, Yao Ziruo, Yao Mulian, Shen Tianxin, Shen Lianfang, Liu Jingqing, Wang Meiliang, Pan Zhaobang, Chen Bohuan, Wu Shutian, Cai Futang (Guo Zusheng), Wei Tingrong, Zhang Qinbo, Rong Zongjing, Qian Chengxu, Yu Huancheng, Yao Ting, Qin Daishi, Chen Shenci, Cheng Haiqiu, Zhou Jianchu, and over forty other people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Cheng Linsheng reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that China's commerce has weak capital and cannot be compared to the powers. The production of goods throughout the country relies on credit loans to inject funds, and the amount of credit loans determines the scope of business. During the financial difficulties of last year, although the banks had 270 million yuan in cash reserves, it was difficult to move and circulate due to the 450 million yuan preparation fund in the hands of Dachang. As a result, there was no silver in the market for turnover, and it was unanimously agreed to request government relief. At the beginning of this year, factories and businesses have mostly suspended operations, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing, threatening social order. Industrial and commercial groups have presented to the government, with the approval of the government, the organization of a 5 million yuan syndicate to maintain the market. Recently, 100 million yuan of financial bonds have been issued to replenish the three banks. Considering the financial future, there are considerable results. At present, cash has been exhausted, and it is impossible to transport without increasing the circulating capital. In previous years, in addition to cash, banknotes, public bonds, and land deeds were circulating in the market. Public bonds and land deeds can only be substitutes in the capital. The number of banknotes depends on the amount of cash. In recent years, the capital has expanded exponentially. Therefore, the circulating capital is becoming increasingly inadequate. Therefore, we propose real estate and try to circulate it, so that all industries have sufficient strength and can develop. Otherwise, the owner will be less affected by the congestion of land deeds, and the damage to those who are subject to the mortgage of land deeds will be alarming. The impact on the future will be even more dangerous than today. This association is the purpose of self-help. We are now seeking specialized talents to draft a submission to the government, organize a committee, request relief, so as to relieve the difficulties of business, and keep financial security.</p>
<p>Discussion Results After the chairman's report, discussions began. Cheng Linsheng, Chu Huiseng, Yu Huancheng, and others all expressed their opinions one after another. Regarding the initial proposal to issue 500 million yuan of circulating bonds, the consensus was that the current environment is difficult. Some advocated to change the issuance to 300 million yuan, some advocated to change the issuance to 400 million yuan, and some advocated to issue 450 million yuan. After much discussion, it was finally decided to submit to the government to issue 450 million yuan. Due to the lack of cash, the cash reserve was changed to 30% (according to a real estate businessman after the meeting, a 30% cash reserve is now very adequate. When President Roosevelt took office in the United States, all domestic bonds were only 25%. The real estate industry's move was taken into consideration in several aspects.) The remaining 50% is reserved for real estate goods, and 20% is reserved for title deeds. Special interest convertible bonds are issued for a period of five years, with a weekly interest rate of 5%. Some people advocate the face value of this convertible bond is 1,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan, so that it is light and easy to keep as a mortgage. In order to facilitate the progress, it was decided to submit this opinion to the government.</p>
<p>Election of Standing Directors In order to make progress, and in the 45 full directors, according to the constitution of the association, Cheng Linsheng, Zhou Weishi, Shen Lianfang, Yu Huancheng, Yao Ting, Zhang Qinbo, Qian Chengxu, Cheng Haiqiu, Pan Zhaobang, Zhou Jianchu, Chu Huiseng, and Shen Tianxin, were elected as standing directors to organize the Standing Committee of Directors to deal with this matter.</p>
<p>Submit a report to the government The focus of the Association's discussion yesterday was the amount and issuance of circulating vouchers so that the government could restore the market as soon as possible. From 3:30 PM to 7:00 PM, after a long discussion, everyone agreed that this matter is important and must be carried out in a serious manner. The content of the submission should determine six principles: (1) Issuing 450 million yuan of circulating vouchers. (2) 30% cash, 50% real estate goods, 20% title deeds, as reserves. (3) A period of five years, with a weekly interest rate of 5%. (4) The face value is divided into 1,000 yuan. 5,000 yuan. 10,000 yuan. Three types (5) Bond nature, for special interest convertible bonds (6) If the government allows the issuance, the government will jointly organize with the relevant agencies, the municipal chamber of commerce, the silver industry, and the real estate industry., A, custodianship, B, valuation, C, design, and other three committees to handle all matters after issuance, which was unanimously agreed to by the attendees and handed over to the Standing Committee of Directors to draft and submit to the government.</p>
<p>Or Will Be Changed Afterwards, the East China News Agency reporter reported that the decision had not yet been finalized. They asked a member of the Standing Committee, who claimed that the real estate industry was aware that the market has been sluggish in recent years, mainly due to a lack of capital. The main reason for the lack of capital is that most of the cash is concentrated due to the acquisition of real estate by the industry, and the industrial and commercial decline is also due to this. Now, for the sake of the economic recovery of the entire country, there is this proposal. The people also believe in the government and the people's power helps the government's power. However, the discussion on today (i.e., yesterday) may not be the final plan when it is implemented in the future. In other words, the issuance still needs to be in accordance with government instructions, taking into account social needs, and can be changed as needed. It was also learned that the association will nominate representatives to request that the government agree when necessary.</p>
<h3>24th Year Financial Public Bonds: Fully Issued on April 1st; Three Banks to Hold Meetings on Capital Increase</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance, to aid industry and commerce and to increase bank capital, is issuing 100 million yuan in financial public bonds for the 24th year of the Republic of China. The regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and are scheduled to be issued on April 1st. Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned from relevant sources yesterday that the issuance method for these public bonds has been agreed upon between Director of the Public Debt Department Jiang Lufu and the banking sector. The bonds will be issued at full face value with an annual interest rate of six percent. The public bond certificates are about to be printed, and the repayment of principal and interest will be entrusted to the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The face values are divided into three types: 5,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 100 yuan. The purpose is to allocate 65 million yuan to supplement the capital of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. The Bank of China has scheduled a meeting on the 30th of this month to submit the proposal to the current shareholders' general meeting for discussion. The Bank of Communications has scheduled a meeting on April 20th to submit the proposal to the current shareholders' general meeting for discussion. The Central Bank will also hold a board of directors meeting to pass the resolution.</p>

<h3>Rice Merchants Order Large Quantities of Foreign Wheat; Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Investigates the Truth</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of increasing import duties on foreign wheat, there has been much speculation recently. However, according to an investigation by a Central News Agency reporter, this rumor is actually inaccurate. The Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Municipal Government of this city to investigate the situation of ordering foreign rice and wheat in this city, due to outside speculation. The reporter has learned details from reliable sources, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Municipal Government's Reply to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city previously received a consultation from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Hankou Chamber of Commerce had reported that factories in this city were ordering large quantities of foreign wheat, which would affect the sales of domestic wheat. The Municipal Government of this city then instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the matter with merchants. From January to the present, 1.5 million tons of foreign wheat and 6 million bags of foreign rice have been imported. According to the content of the report from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, it was proposed to prohibit the import of foreign wheat, and there were no requests to the Ministry of Finance to increase import duties on foreign wheat. Therefore, the recent rumor that the Ministry of Finance will increase import duties on foreign wheat is likely due to a misunderstanding. After the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau clearly investigated the truth, it has already submitted a report to the Municipal Government for a reply to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Imports Decline</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance levied import duties on foreign wheat, foreign wheat imports have decreased. In this city, foreign wheat is mostly used for flour production. It is inconvenient to use purely domestic wheat for manufacturing, so foreign wheat must be used. In previous years, foreign wheat imports were much larger than this year. Since the authorities levied the foreign wheat tax, most flour mills have prioritized using domestic wheat for flour production. According to customs import investigations, foreign wheat imports have indeed decreased.</p>
<p>Tax Increase Unlikely to Materialize</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has not considered increasing taxes on foreign wheat because the quantity of foreign wheat imports has already decreased. According to someone familiar with commercial conditions, the recent rumors of a tax increase in the city market are because some merchants, seeing the recent trend of declining wheat flour prices, fear that if foreign wheat imports continue unabated, wheat prices may fall again. Therefore, after the rumor of increasing import duties on foreign wheat spread, wheat prices in the market have slightly increased. However, based on the current supply situation, it is unlikely that the tax increase on foreign wheat will materialize.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Dispatches Special Inspectors to Supervise Stamp Sales; Wang Wenwei Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Proceeds to Zhejiang for Supervision; Post Office's Purchase of Stamps in Zhejiang and Other Provinces Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>Due to the poor performance of stamp tax revenue in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan provinces in recent months, the Ministry of Finance has specially appointed Wang Wenwei, a member of the Committee for the Reorganization of Local Taxes, and Shi Chunsen, an inspector of the Ministry, as inspection commissioners. They will go to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces to inspect and supervise stamp tax matters. Commissioner Shi will go directly from Beijing to Anhui and Jiangxi provinces in the coming days. Commissioner Wang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and will go to Zhejiang Province. He plans to first inspect Hangzhou County and then go to Ningbo, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, and other counties for supervision to increase national revenue. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter visited Commissioner Wang yesterday to inquire about various aspects of stamp tax. Wang's remarks are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks: For many years, stamp tax bureaus in various provinces and cities have adopted the consignment method for selling stamps. Each province determines the quantity of stamps to be sold based on the complexity of commerce. For example, if a provincial tax bureau consigns an average of several tens of thousands of yuan of stamps per month, it actually pays 80% in national currency, with the remaining 20% used as the monthly expenses of the provincial tax bureau. The counties under its jurisdiction consign a certain amount of stamps to the provincial bureau each month. The tax bureaus in these counties then implement mandatory apportionment methods to sell stamps to shops in the local area. Merchants complain and oppose this, but the tax bureaus only care about their own tax revenue quota and ignore the merchants. Merchants, under the pressure of high-pressure apportionment of stamps, take the opportunity to be opportunistic, not affixing stamps when they should or selling the accumulated stamps at a discount, causing the value and credit of the nation's full-value stamp tickets to suffer a loss, which is regrettable. The tax bureaus only care about the monthly revenue reaching the quota and do not inquire or investigate whether various shops affix stamps according to the law. As a result, the number of accumulated stamps in the market gradually increases, and the amount of money that provincial and municipal tax bureaus remit to the national treasury has not increased in recent years. Minister Kong, in light of this, urgently wanted to relieve the people from the suffering of mandatory apportionment by tax bureaus. At last year's National Financial Conference, he proposed that stamp tax tickets be sold by post offices, allowing people to freely purchase stamps for use, and that 40% of the money from stamp sales by post offices in each province be allocated to offset the losses from the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies in provinces and counties. This method has been implemented since November 1st of last year. The old stamps that the people purchased and stored before and have not yet used can be registered and exchanged for new stamps according to separate regulations. After three months, the total number of stamps sold by post offices in various provinces and cities is quite good. In January of this year, the national treasury's stamp revenue increased by 171,428.06 yuan compared to the average monthly amount paid by tax bureaus in the 22nd year of the Republic. Among them, Beijing City saw the largest increase. The tax bureau previously sold an average of 17,800 yuan of stamps per month, while the number of stamps sold by the post office in January increased to 36,616.5 yuan, more than double the previous amount. Other provinces such as Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, etc., and the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Qingdao have also increased significantly compared to the sales of the previous tax bureaus. However, the tax revenue in the five provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan is poor, mainly because merchants do not understand the central government's painstaking efforts to reform and eliminate abuses, thinking that since the people are free to purchase stamps at the post office, they can do as they please, not affixing stamps when they should, or because local inspections are not strict, still using old, invalid stamps. This has resulted in the number of stamps sold by the post office in those provinces in January being far less than the amount sold by the tax bureau in the 22nd year of the Republic. Zhejiang Province is the worst. The Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau previously sold an average of 84,450 yuan of stamps per month, while the amount sold by the post office in January of this year was only 20,000 yuan. The February report from the Zhejiang Provincial Post Office on stamp sales was received yesterday, showing an increase to 57,826.79 yuan, but this is still a decrease of 26,623.21 yuan compared to the average monthly sales in the 22nd year of the Republic. The purpose of being dispatched to Zhejiang for strict supervision is to make the merchants in that province understand that the central government has completely eliminated the old practice of forced apportionment and completely relieved the people of their hardships. Then, the people should also abide by the law at all times, purchasing and using stamps, affixing stamps when they should, to increase national revenue, and not try to take advantage of loopholes, failing to affix stamps or still affixing old, invalid stamps. Once discovered, they will be severely punished according to the Stamp Tax Law.</p>
<p>Supervisory Rules: A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter obtained the following rules for supervising stamp tax from another source yesterday: Article 1: The Ministry of Finance, in order to urge municipal and county governments to carry out inspections of stamp tax and stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus to carry out random checks of stamp tax, appoints supervisory commissioners to carry out supervisory duties. The supervisory commissioners mentioned above are concurrently filled by personnel from national tax agencies in various places appointed by the Ministry of Finance. When necessary, additional personnel may be assigned to handle the matter. Article 2: When any of the following circumstances occur, the Ministry of Finance shall order the supervisory commissioner to go to inspect all stamp-affixing vouchers of various shops: (1) According to the monthly report of stamp tax tickets sold by the post office, if it is found that the number of stamp sales in a certain city or county is sluggish; (2) When the monthly report of stamp tax tickets sold by the post office is sent to the stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureau in charge for verification and is found to be significantly lower compared to the past; (3) When checking the monthly random inspection report of stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus in various provinces, if a large number of cases of missed stamps are found in a certain city or county, or if the report is considered doubtful. Article 3: When performing their duties, supervisory commissioners shall, in addition to supervising all vouchers that should be affixed with stamps, also pay attention to investigating the following points: (1) How many times does the municipal or county government carry out inspections each month, and are they seriously implemented according to each business household; (2) How many times does the stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureau carry out random checks each month, and how many business households are checked for every few business households; (3) When inspecting or randomly checking, how many violations of the Stamp Tax Law are found on average each month; (4) Whether inspectors or random checkers have any improper practices such as notifying in advance, favoritism and exemption from inspection, private unauthorized punishment, or harassment on the pretext; (5) Whether there are any vouchers that should be affixed with stamps, but merchants have not yet affixed them according to the law; (6) What is the commercial situation in the supervisory area, and what is the average actual number of stamps sold. Article 4: When performing their duties, supervisory commissioners shall supervise and closely handle the matter together with the random inspection commissioners dispatched by the stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus of each province or the inspection personnel dispatched by the municipal and county governments. When necessary, they may conduct supervision together with the police themselves, but they should still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 6 to 9 of the Inspection of Stamp Tax Rules. Article 5: Violations of the Stamp Tax Law discovered by supervisory commissioners when performing their duties shall still be sent to the local government and forwarded to the judicial organs for trial according to the law. Article 6: After the violations of the Stamp Tax Law discovered by supervisory commissioners when performing their duties are punished by the judicial organs according to the law, the 40% fine that should be obtained shall be distributed separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Inspection of Stamp Tax Rules and Article 9 of the Random Inspection of Stamp Tax Rules. Supervisory commissioners shall not receive this bonus. Article 7: After the supervisory commissioner has completed the supervisory matter, they shall submit a detailed report on the supervisory situation to the Ministry of Finance for verification and handling. In the event of special circumstances, they shall also report at any time. Article 8: After receiving the report, if the Ministry of Finance verifies that the inspection or random check is indeed ineffective, it shall issue orders to severely punish the responsible personnel. Those whose inspection or random check is unusually serious shall also be issued orders to be given preferential rewards. Article 9: If there are any matters not covered in these rules, the Ministry of Finance may amend them at any time. Article 10: These rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Cotton Trading Association Requests Increase in Foreign Cotton Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Trading Association sent a telegram to the government, saying, "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, National Economic Council, and Cotton Control Committee, we respectfully report that since the implementation of cotton control in our country, no effort has been spared in expanding cotton fields and improving cotton seeds. In the past two years, remarkable achievements have been made, and cotton merchants and farmers across the country are deeply gratified, believing that our country's cotton production can henceforth meet the needs of the entire country and further seek overseas sales to make up for deficits and stabilize the national foundation. However, since the implementation of the silver policy in the United States, rapid progress has been made, and our country is the first to feel the impact of silver outflow. In recent months, it has affected the market and finance, causing a major panic, like raging waves that cannot be stopped. The government is overwhelmed with relief, and industry and commerce lack the means to maintain themselves. Under these circumstances, the sharp drop in prices is expected, but among them, the cotton industry has suffered the most, which in turn endangers the national commerce as well. Cotton is a major product of our country, and national commerce relies on it for turnover. Once a major change occurs, it will affect the whole body. According to current statistics, about two million dan of cotton are stored in domestic centralized markets. Due to the extraordinarily tight money supply last winter and spring, merchants have stopped transporting it, and millions of dan are still stored in rural areas unsold, which are expected to be more than enough to supply the domestic cotton spinning needs. Since the market has undergone a major change and foreign cotton has been dumped, prices have fallen sharply. According to recent selling prices, compared with two months ago, fine cotton has decreased in value by about 20 yuan per dan, which has already fallen by one-third. Combining the cotton stored in centralized markets, based on current selling prices, it is estimated that there will be a loss of 30 million yuan. It is still difficult to predict whether future market prices can be maintained and not fall further, and there is still a large amount of cotton stored in rural areas. If the market price falls and does not rise, the future losses will be even greater. At a time when all industries are declining and finance is exhausted, in a very short period of time, the cotton industry alone has suffered such a huge loss. If the market price falls and does not rise, the impact on future commerce will be even greater. Those with insight are alarmed and surprised by this unprecedented change. What is even more painful is that since the dumping of foreign cotton, general yarn factories have not thought about uniting and using domestic cotton, but have competed to purchase foreign cotton to coerce domestic cotton. According to recent investigations, various yarn factories have purchased about 100,000 pieces of Indian and American cotton, and the outflow of money has reached 20 million, which is truly shocking. It has been investigated that since winter to spring, the government has purchased silver in Hong Kong and London to prevent market panic, on the one hand, and hopes that the Chinese people will reduce the purchase of foreign goods to fill the loopholes. According to newspaper reports, about 2 million yuan of silver has been shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and about 3 million yuan has been shipped from London, totaling no more than 5 million yuan. The amount of foreign cotton purchased by various yarn factories recently exceeds the amount of silver purchased by more than three times. On the one hand, it is driving the outflow of huge amounts of money, and on the other hand, it is promoting the surplus of domestic cotton. Such a suicidal policy of the yarn factory industry cannot but make people feel sorry and worry about the cotton industry being unable to extricate itself. Some say that this foreign cotton transaction not only belongs to the Chinese, but also Japanese yarn factories have purchased it. This move should be considered a miscalculation by Japanese yarn factories. The manufacturers stationed in the country still rely on the resident country to sell their products. If they do not pay attention to sales and make adjustments to raw materials, abandoning the fundamentals for the pursuit of trivialities will inevitably lead to sluggish sales and self-inflicted losses, which is deeply regrettable. We believe that the danger to our country's cotton industry today is imminent. In addition to requesting the government to make a decisive decision to increase foreign cotton import taxes as soon as possible and to find ways to stabilize domestic cotton prices and find a way out, there is no other way to remedy the situation. The tax rate is used as a barrier to prevent foreign goods from invading in various countries of the world. Since our country's tariffs have already been autonomous, they are not as constrained as before. For the sake of safeguarding the national foundation, increasing the foreign cotton import tax rate can be understood by friendly countries. We hereby report in detail, imploring the esteemed Yuan and Ministries to have compassion on the cotton merchants across the country who are on the verge of bankruptcy and to quickly implement the increase in foreign cotton import tax rates, and to find ways to stabilize domestic cotton market prices and to actively explore outlets for future cotton production increases, so that the cotton industry of the whole country can be revived, production will not be in surplus, and rural areas will have new hope. We anxiously await orders." The Shanghai Cotton Trading Association respectfully bows. You.</p>

<h3>New Life Movement Inspection Team, Xu Qingyu and Others Arrive in Shanghai; Publish Impressions of Inspecting Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Provinces and Cities; Two Railway Bureaus Host a Reception Yesterday Afternoon, Board Ship This Morning and Set Off</h3>
<p>Xu Qingyu, Zhang Yuchong, Lin Xueyan, and Yu Zhongqi, a team of four from the New Life Movement Promotion Association Inspection Team, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday after completing their inspection of the New Life Movement in Zhejiang. Yesterday afternoon, they attended a reception hosted by the two railway bureaus at the Qingyang Port Railway Hotel. At 10:00 PM that night, they boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yu Shun ship and set off to Fujian for inspection this morning. Before leaving, Xu Qingyu, the leader of the team, also shared his impressions of inspecting the New Life Movement in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui with reporters from the National News Agency. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Impressions of Inspecting the New Life Movement in Various Provinces</p>
<p>Xu Qingyu, the leader of the New Life Movement Inspection Team, shared his impressions of inspecting the New Life Movement in Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai with reporters from the National News Agency before leaving. Mr. Xu said that the promotion of the New Life Movement in various places has made some progress. This is all due to the efforts of the party and government authorities and industry, commerce, and academia in various places. If the authorities and all sectors in various places continue to work hard to promote it in the future, the development of the New Life Movement is indeed limitless. Mr. Xu added that the results of his inspection of the three provinces this time show that the cleanliness and order of the city appearance are best in Hangzhou and Zhenjiang. The cleanliness of the streets and the observance of order by pedestrians are rare in other places. The improvement of administrative efficiency should be attributed to Shanghai, such as the organization of archives in various municipal government agencies, various social investigations, and statistical materials, which are well-organized and extremely valuable. In addition, the spirit of the New Life Youth Service Corps is also better in Shanghai, Anqing, and Wuhu. The cleanliness and order of schools and the diligence of students have improved in all places. The progress of police administration is better in Zhejiang Province. In short, the authorities and all sectors in various places are willing to earnestly promote the New Life Movement, so progress is so rapid.</p>
<p>Rapid Progress in the New Life Movement on Two Railways</p>
<p>Mr. Xu also told reporters from the National News Agency that the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus are working very hard to promote the New Life Movement, and the results are very good. For example, the accuracy of the railway timetable and the attention to railway cleanliness have indeed made great progress. When he inspected the two railway bureaus and various stations this time, all the responsible persons were full of energy and serious in their work. Dr. Wu Shaozeng, the acting director of the bureau, is very enthusiastic about promoting the New Life Movement, so the progress of the New Life Movement on the two railways is relatively rapid.</p>
<p>Two Railway Bureaus Host Reception at Qingyang Port Station</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the four commissioners of the New Life Movement Inspection Team went to Qingyang Port Station for inspection and also inspected the villages near Qingyang Port. At noon, the authorities of the two railways hosted a reception for the four commissioners at the Qingyang Port Railway Hotel. More than a dozen people attended, including Wu Shaozeng, the acting director of the two railways, and Xu Yuanfang, the director of the General Affairs Department, and Cao Shengzhi, the deputy director. During the banquet, Mr. Xu gave detailed instructions on promoting the New Life Movement on the two railways. After the banquet, they took a car back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Board Ship Last Night and Head to Fujian This Morning</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Inspection Team of four has boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yu Shun ship at 10:00 PM last night and sailed to Fujian this morning. Mr. Xu Qingyu has repeatedly received telegrams from the Wuchang Provisional Headquarters urging him to no longer go to Fujian, but because Chairman Chen Yi of Fujian has repeatedly telegraphed to welcome him, Mr. Xu decided to go to Fujian with him. However, Mr. Xu will only stay in Fujian for one day and plans to return to Shanghai on the original ship, and then fly back to Wuchang on the China National Aviation Corporation's plane on the 3rd of next month to attend an important meeting of the Provisional Headquarters. The other three inspectors plan to stay in Fujian for a few more days.</p>
<h3>North China Shipping Alliance: Various Companies Reorganize</h3>
<p>The cooperation of Chinese shipping companies on the North China route, including China Merchants, Sanbei, Beifang, Huaning, Zhaoxing, Zhidong, Haichang, Datong, Yuanda, Zhengji, Heping, and Huitong, a total of 25 companies, began to unite on June 18th of last year. At that time, it was decided that all Allied shipping companies must uniformly abide by freight rates and must not arbitrarily load or unload. If price cuts are used to compete for transport, and the joint office verifies it, in addition to confiscating the 2,000 yuan deposit, a fine will be discussed. Since its implementation, no accidents have occurred in half a year, and foreign shipping companies have been severely hit.</p>
<p>Invisible Stagnation</p>
<p>Last winter, a certain shipping company suddenly violated the articles of association, secretly reducing the freight rate for flour transportation. The matter was reported by the customs broker, and a general meeting was convened by the joint office for public discussion. It was decided to confiscate its deposit and discuss a fine. However, the shipping company did not accept this resolution, and the representative sent to the office no longer went, withdrawing from the alliance invisibly. This case could not be enforced, and other members also acted freely, causing the hard-won North China Shipping Alliance to stagnate invisibly.</p>
<p>Foreign Competition: Various shipping companies in this port telegraphed the Tianjin joint office, saying that since the North China Shipping Alliance was suspended, foreign shipping companies on the same route have taken the opportunity to compete for large batches of passengers and cargo on the Shanghai-Tianjin route. If Chinese shipping companies do not unite again to consolidate their line of defense, they will be defeated by foreign shipping companies one by one.</p>
<p>Alliance Revival: The Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Joint Office in this port immediately informed the various shipping companies to seek a remedy. After several days of consultation, it was generally agreed that the only way to make the North China Shipping Alliance revive as soon as possible, revitalize the joint line of defense, and continue the spirit of unity. There is no other way to remedy this. Last Saturday, representatives of various shipping companies were convened at the Shipping Association to discuss the revival procedures, and the various companies unanimously agreed.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Aviation Solicitation News: Discarded Cigarette Packs Reallocated to Aviation Patriotic Donations</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association began its solicitation work, it repeatedly received letters and telegrams from various teams requesting supplementary solicitation documents, which were promptly sent out for use. It is reported that yesterday, the captain of the 83rd team, Tong Hangbai, requested the issuance of 500 more badges, 500 membership applications, 10 solicitation promotional guides, and 50 of each type of promotional material. The captain of the 261st team, Chen Peide, requested 300 badges and 20 donation receipts. The captain of the 33rd team, Tang Baoshu, requested 300 old membership applications, 100 badges, and 5 membership fee receipts. The captain of the 241st team, Yuan Lianghua, requested 5 membership fee receipts. The headquarters office has already sent these items separately.</p>
<p>The captain of the 261st team, Chen Peide, is working very hard in the solicitation work. He had previously hired a vice-captain and team members to take on tasks. It is now reported that he has further hired Chen Fusheng, Fei Keguang, Niu Kaitai, Huang Wennong, Yu Yunzhang, Cao Bing, Tong Heshang, Li Chunde, Zou Weide, Zhang Chuncai, Hong Meiquan, and fifteen others as team members. The captain of the 393rd team, Chen Yafei, has requested the further hiring of Zhao Shiji, Wu Jue, and Zhang Fugen as vice-captains of that team. The captain of the 177th team, Chen Zixin, has requested the hiring of Pan Zhiwen and Cheng Weiyu as vice-captains, and Feng Ren, Wu Yiqing, Xue Zimei, and Chen Linsheng as team members. It is reported that the headquarters office has already hired them separately and issued letters of appointment. To raise aviation patriotic donations through waste recycling, the headquarters office had planned to collect all discarded cigarette packs in the city at certain intervals and sell them to various cigarette factories, with the proceeds going to the aviation patriotic donation. It had sent a letter to the Cigarette Manufacturers' Association for handling. The association specifically convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday, attended by Shen Weiting, Yu Panqin, Jing Yimeng, Lao Jingxiu, and twelve others. Zhang Yuliang from the headquarters office was sent to attend and report. Chaired by Shen Weiting, the discussion passed a resolution that all cigarette factories unanimously adopt the recycling of discarded cigarette packs to be used for aviation patriotic donations. The headquarters office is currently drafting measures for collecting discarded cigarette packs and will submit them to the headquarters commander for approval before they can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Yongjia Chamber of Commerce Requests Shanghai Merchants Steam Navigation Co. to Reassign New Ship to Wenzhou Due to Old Age of Hai'an</h3>
<p>The Guangji steamer of the Shanghai Merchants Steam Navigation Co.'s Wenzhou route was opposed by various circles in Wenzhou last year, leading to its suspension. It has been left stranded in Shanghai ever since and has not yet been sold. Because there is a shortage of ships in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the bureau is now planning to send the Guangji steamer to the middle section of the Yangtze River, which is still under consideration. Unexpectedly, the Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce in Wenzhou sent an official letter to the Shanghai Merchants Steam Navigation Co., stating that various circles in Wenzhou have reported that the Hai'an steamer, which sails between Shanghai and Wenzhou, is already old and dilapidated, over sixty years old. Sailing in the Wenzhou sea is feared to encounter storms, which could lead to danger and have a huge impact on the lives and property of the people of Wenzhou. They requested that a new ship be reassigned to the route as soon as possible. The bureau replied yesterday, stating that although the hull of the Hai'an is old, its machinery and hull are very strong. The Maritime Administration Bureau and the United Insurance Association have sent experts to inspect and believe that it is sufficient to sail and there is no danger at all. As for the request to replace it with a new ship, the bureau is considering it and will build it as soon as funds are available to fulfill the earnest request.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Changes Rickshaw Licensing Procedures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has now decided to set up a special licensing office for private rickshaws at 396 Fair Road, starting from March 29th. Anyone who wants to obtain a license must first obtain a petition form (available from the licensing office, the Revenue Office, or the branch police station), fill it out completely, sign and seal it, and prepare a license registration fee of 50 cents (paid only once), along with the summer rickshaw tax of 8 yuan, to apply for a rickshaw license. The licensing office will then issue a numbered plate to be nailed to the left side of the rickshaw. This number will not be changed when renewing the license in the future. At the same time, a small colored tag will be issued to indicate that the summer tax has been paid. Residents of the Settlement and areas outside the Settlement, as well as Zhabei residents, must go to Fair Road to apply. Residents of the French Concession and the South City must go to the French Municipal Council to apply. Businesses and organizations should apply based on the location of their head office. The vehicle license plate should be returned to the licensing office when not in use, otherwise the tax must continue to be paid. If anyone forges names and addresses or obtains a car license by fraud, the license will be revoked once discovered.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Pan Randomly Checks Household Registration Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia, accompanied by Provincial Committee Member Feng Huawen, randomly checked household registration in the fifth district of Pudong yesterday. They were accompanied by Xing Zhigang, the district chief, and Wang Caisheng, the registrar, and went to various townships and towns in Chenhang and Tiqiao to review the households one by one. They also explained the responsibilities of the newly compiled Baojia chiefs in detail and instructed them thoroughly. They also inquired about the secondary households in the jointly guaranteed agreements that have already been processed. In addition to holding the Baojia responsible, they also ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and take action to eliminate them at any time, in order to secure the inter-agency relationship.</p>

<h3>New Couples in Group Wedding Reach Fifty-Six Pairs Three Pairs Have Temporarily Withdrawn Rehearsal Held One Day Prior</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipality promoted the New Life Movement and implemented thrift, the first group wedding ceremony held by the municipal government has been decided by the wedding committee organized by the Social Affairs Bureau to be held on the 3rd of next month. The quota was originally set at fifty couples, but the number of participants was quite enthusiastic. As of the end of February, fifty-nine couples had registered. However, one couple notified their withdrawal because the bride was seriously ill and could not recover within a few days. Another couple was deemed by the wedding committee to be in violation of the regulations due to other reasons, and their registration was cancelled after registration. Another couple also withdrew due to business. Currently, a total of fifty-six pairs have been approved. The ceremony will be rehearsed in the auditorium of the municipal government one day before the wedding. At this time, only the new couple is allowed to attend, and all gifts are declined. The municipal government will also send two cars to pick them up in front of the Great World and at the Baoshan Road intersection on the same day.</p>
<h3>Wusong Water Supply Problem</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company and the Public Works Bureau have signed a contract with the "Great Community" cloud. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, which is run by merchants, believes that the water consumption expenses of households in the Wusong area are extremely large. Therefore, it specifically requested the Public Works Bureau to allow it to be designated as the company's business area. Now the request has been formally passed at the 276th Municipal Council meeting, and the Public Works Bureau Director Xu Peihuang was appointed to represent the contract. It is reported that the contract was officially signed the day before yesterday, stipulating Wusong, Zhanghuabang, and Wenzaobang as its water supply areas, with water supplied by extending the water pipes from the city center area.</p>
<p>Zhanghuabang Area Begins Water Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to the company's spokesperson speaking to the "Great Community" reporter, regarding the tap water project in the Wusong area, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company had already completed its planning and was ready to start construction before the January 28th Incident. However, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the original water and electricity construction in Zhabei was destroyed. After the war stopped, it made efforts to restore the old projects and build various projects in the city center area, which resulted in the Wusong area's project plan not being implemented. Recently, it signed a contract with the Public Works Bureau and began to install water pipe projects in Zhanghuabang and Wenzaobang. As the tax authorities in this area urgently need water, the water pipes have been extended and connected from the city center area, and water supply has now begun.</p>
<p>Entire Project to be Completed This Year</p>
<p>The water pipe project from Zhanghuabang to Wusong Town is very far and the project is huge. The total cost is estimated at approximately 82,200 yuan. If necessary, it is planned to extend it to Tongji University. Currently, the company believes that the project needs to be constructed urgently and decided to start construction in the short term. It is expected that the entire project will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<h3>Famous American Biologist Arrives in Shanghai Talks About Strange Fish in South America Large Electric Fish Uses Its Electricity to Snatch Food Fish Powerful Enough to Stun a Person and Cause Drowning</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, Mr. Colbert, a famous biologist and fisherman from California, USA, recently arrived in Shanghai with his wife aboard the President Hoover. Mr. Colbert recently traveled with American millionaire Mr. Hall in a yacht on the Amazon River in South America. It is said that there are 500 species of fish in the river. The strangest is a large electric fish, about eight feet long and eight inches wide. To capture its food, it first uses electricity to make it lose consciousness, and it is powerful enough to stun a person and cause drowning. This fish tastes very delicious. The locals catch it by driving livestock to swim in the water. When the fish sees it, it immediately generates electricity to attack it. When its electricity is exhausted, it is easy to catch with a net. There is also a flying snake, the largest of which is no more than eight inches long. It has a bone under its belly that is the same length as its body and can shoot out poisonous gas. According to scholars, if trees are pierced by it, they will wither and die immediately. In addition, there is a fish called Piranha, which is full of rivers. It is also capable of attacking people. The largest is no more than twenty inches long, but it can devour a huge cow to the bones in half an hour. As soon as it smells blood, it arrives in groups and will eat all the bleeding objects before stopping. Mr. Colbert's visit to China this time is to investigate the commercial situation, but if he sees strange biological specimens, he will buy them back at a high price.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Civic Association Reasons for Opposing Telephone Price Increase Sent Letter to Municipal Council Board of Directors Yesterday Requesting Disapproval</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Community Association and the First District Branch of the Civic Association of this city worked very hard in the past to oppose the telephone price increase and united various groups to rise up in protest. Although a satisfactory result was not obtained, it was stated at the time that payment would be made under protest, and the original price should be restored after a considerable period of time, and no price increase should be allowed in the future. However, not long after that, the Shanghai Telephone Company again applied to the Municipal Council for a price increase. The reason for the price increase is to maintain a government interest of one cent, which is now eight mills, and two mills must be added. The method of the spring increase system is only limited to 100 calls per month. If the 100 calls are exceeded, each call will be increased by five cents, and if more than 100 calls are exceeded, each call will be increased by four cents. If more than 300 calls are exceeded, each call will be increased by three cents. Such a price increase means that the expenditure on the user side will actually increase to more than double. Although the Municipal Council Boards of Directors of the British and French Concessions only approved a maximum increase of 1.25%, users still find it difficult to bear this heavy burden given the reality of the declining market and stagnant economy. Therefore, after investigating the usage of various users, the association has sent letters to various legal groups, requesting a united and forceful rebuttal. Yesterday, it also sent a letter to the Municipal Council Board of Directors, stating the reasons why the telephone price should not be increased. There are five main points: (1) The fees for public utilities cannot be based solely on the amount of profit of the company, but must also take into account whether the economic strength of the citizens can afford it. The decline of the Shanghai market and the stagnation of the economy have reached an extreme point, as everyone knows. However, the telephone company insists on its own way and wants to guarantee a profit of one cent, and in fact, it is more than double. This is not in line with the way of running a public utility, but is simply engaging in monopoly. The Municipal Council should not be blinded by it and should not restrain it. (2) If it is said that the capital investment of the telephone company is too large and the expenses are too large, then the fault lies in the company's lack of planning, and users cannot be forced to compensate for its losses. Now the company does not promote its business or seek to save on expenses, which is actually a deliberate creation of a price increase situation in order to achieve its permanent high profits. Taking the repair cost of telephone sets as an example, it is said that the telephone company entrusts Shanghai Electric Power Company to repair them, and each one costs only 15 taels, requiring a huge amount of 400,000 taels per year. This method of the telephone company seems too stupid and is definitely a deliberate transfer of funds in order to form a reason for price increases and achieve its permanent high profits. Taking this one example, other cases can be known. If the company can really engage in cost savings and not spend so much wastefully, its profits should be considerable, so why increase prices? (3) Telephone is one of the tools of transportation. It is necessary to try to lower its price to increase the number of users and help the development of the city and the prosperity of the market. However, the telephone company's desire for profit is so strong that the previous price increase has already reduced the number of users. Now it is increasing again, and the actual increase is several times higher. This will inevitably further reduce the number of users, directly reduce the efficiency of users, and indirectly affect municipal facilities and social security. There is no greater blunder than this. The Concession authorities who understand the impact of telephones on administration should not only allow them to increase prices repeatedly but also strive to reduce fees, induce citizens, and promote widespread use. Then the locality will benefit from it, and the company will also benefit. Otherwise, the company will ultimately end up wanting to gain but losing, and local security and social transportation will be hindered. Can the Concession authorities who are wise turn a blind eye to it and simply agree to it? (4) As for the method of increasing prices based on the number of calls, it is even more absurd. Limiting it to 100 calls is a fact that any user who installs a telephone because of need will never use it only three or four times a day. However, an investigation of users' usage shows that very few shops use it 20 times a day, and most use it about 40 or 50 times. Therefore, it can be inferred that after the price increase based on the number of calls, it will actually increase to two or three times or more. The expression of its greed is obvious. (5) Companies that operate public utilities tend to become consolidated because they obtain a monopoly. In the world, the interest rate on capital should be lower than that of general businesses. The discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States is 2.5%, the Bank of England in the United Kingdom is 2%, and the interest rate on our national bonds is 6%. The interest rates on the bonds of the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Telephone Company are both 6%. Why did the municipal authorities approve the telephone company's income to be 8%, and even that is not enough and must be increased by 1.25%, which is almost one cent? This is considered that not only cannot it be increased by the number of calls, but also the price increase of 1.25% cannot be allowed. It is further requested that the telephone company take a long-term view, reduce fees, popularize users, and expand the existing equipment, so that its income will not exceed one cent.</p>
<p>Various stores in Hongkou District's East-West Huade Road, Qiqihar Road, etc., have heard that the Shanghai Telephone Company will implement a price increase starting on April 1st. At a time when commerce is declining, how can merchants and civilians bear the burden? Therefore, they have sent letters to the 20th District Branch of the Civic Association, requesting serious negotiations. After receiving the report, the association convened an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, attended by Xing Guxiang, Chen Jingxuan, He Yiming, and more than 30 others. Xing Guxiang was elected chairman, and after the report was given, it was resolved to firmly oppose the price increase. The Civic Association also sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association requesting them to forward the letter to negotiate. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, in recent times, the market has been depressed, the economy is barren, and the closure of shops and factories is heard of every day. The commercial port, which has always been known for its prosperity, will be severely hit and collapse. How should we try to save it and solve the suffering? Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Telephone Company, without thinking that the telephone is a public undertaking, has rashly proposed a price increase by virtue of its authority. Since the telephone is a public transportation undertaking, whether it is state-owned or merchant-owned, it must not be compared with ordinary commercial enterprises that only seek profit. The company has simply violated the interests of the public users and proposed a price increase, and has also imposed various harsh measures. When the members of our association learned about this, they were panic-stricken. After a consensus, it was decided to send a letter to your association requesting you to promptly submit serious negotiations to the Municipal Council and order the company to cancel this proposal in order to calm public anger and relieve commercial hardship. This is in the public interest. Respectfully, to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession."</p>
<h3>Construction Vehicle of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company Causes Accident in City Center Damages Social Affairs Bureau Employee Vehicle Four Injured Sent to Hospital for Examination and Treatment</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau moved to the city center, it has provided three cars to pick up and drop off employees, most of whom still live in the South City. At 8:55 yesterday morning, the bureau's car No. 1 picked up employees from Xiaoximen, Xiaonanmen, and other places and drove to the bureau. When it reached the vicinity of No. 1 Park on Guhe Road in the city center, driving from south to north, a construction vehicle of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company suddenly sped eastward from Zhengtong Road. Car No. 1 of the bureau urgently sounded its horn and braked, but at that time, the northeast wind was very strong, and the sound of the horn was not easy to transmit. Moreover, the construction vehicle was fully loaded with wires, wooden poles, and other materials, obstructing the driver's vision, which resulted in the damage to the employee vehicle of the Social Affairs Bureau. The vehicle carried about 30 male and female employees of the bureau. After being hit, the car rushed out of the road and knocked down the iron road sign standing on the roadside. The intensity of the impact can be imagined. Fortunately, the body of the car was strong, and only four employees in the car were seriously injured.

<h3>Kidnappers in Wei Tingrong Case Deny Insulting Judge Still Claim Legal Action Was Unjust Judge Orders Further Investigation and Re-Examination</h3>
<p>Wei Tingrong, commander of the former French Concession Chinese Volunteer Corps, Hua Dong Committee member of the French Municipal Council, and current manager of the Sino-French Bank, a Ningbo native, was kidnapped at noon on July 24th of the 18th year. In the case, the French police arrested three kidnappers, Zhu Jincheng from Anhui, Chen Zhongheng from Zhejiang, and Tang Shiliang from Songjiang, and handed them over to the former French Public Concession to be sentenced to five years in prison each. After the expiration of the term, they were sent to the local government for trial. Now that the legal rights in the Concession have been recovered, a special second court and a special second prison have been established. After the five-year prison term of Zhu and others expired, they were transferred from the special second prison to the special second court for review. Judge Qiu HuanYing held court twice for the trial and also transferred the files of the later arrested accomplices, Lü Ruowang, Cai Weicai, and others who had been sentenced, for verification. Zhu and others were defended by lawyers, and the announcement of the conclusion was made. On the 22nd of this month, Judge Qiu came to the eighth criminal court to announce the verdict. Zhu's sentence was reduced to seven years in prison, and Chen and Tang's sentences were reduced to six years in prison each. At that time, when Zhu heard the verdict, he was full of ferocity and scolded the judge for flattering Wei. The court was furious when it heard this and ordered the police to take Zhu and others back into custody and send them to the prosecutor for investigation. The circumstances of the case have been recorded in previous reports. The presiding judge reported to President Wang Simo and prepared a document to transfer Zhu to the prosecutor's office, requesting an investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Wang Ren specifically opened the sixth court and ordered Zhu Jincheng to be brought to the court for interrogation. Zhu confessed that he was 37 years old, from Huaining, Anhui. He had previously served in the military and political circles. When he was arrested, he was serving as a member of the Anhui Finance Department. The official asked, "Were you sentenced to five years in prison by the French Public Concession for kidnapping?" Zhu replied, "Yes, the five-year term has now expired." The official asked, "On the 22nd of this month, Judge Qiu sentenced you to seven years in prison. Why did you insult the judge?" Zhu replied, "I did not insult the judge. I only said that Wei Tingrong had great power and the police station flattered him because I was wronged in this case. During the 20th year of the Republic of China, Wei came to the prison several times to teach us to bite his relative Zhao Weisheng, so Wei intentionally framed me and made me suffer in this case. I am really wronged, please pay attention, judge." After verifying the confession, Prosecutor Wang ordered Zhu Jincheng to be returned to custody to await further investigation before a scheduled re-examination, and then adjourned the court. It is also heard that Zhu, Chen, Tang, and others are preparing to file an appeal against the review verdict. Whether this is true remains to be verified.</p>
<h3>Liu Wenqing's Family: Two Adopted Daughters Missing; One Abducted and Defiled by a Chauffeur; Arrest Ordered, Investigation Completed, Prosecution Initiated</h3>
<p>Liu Wenqing, a native of Fujian and former employee of the Navy Department, had been residing in his hometown. Since the Fujian Incident of the previous year, he moved with his family to Shanghai, living as a rentier at No. 3 Rongfu Lane, Zhangjia Garden, Maitehesi Tu Road, West Shanghai. Nearing seventy, Liu was lonely, so he adopted two girls from his hometown: Youlin and Youdong. They were raised until adulthood. Youlin was 22, and Youdong was three years younger. But on the morning of the 9th of this month, around 9 a.m., these sister flowers suddenly</p>
<p>Declared Missing</p>
<p>Besides entrusting people to search in all directions, Liu Wenqing, suspecting their improper conduct and association with villains, hired a lawyer to publish an advertisement in the newspaper on the 11th of this month, declaring the termination of the adoption relationship with Liu Youlin and Liu Youdong. Henceforth, all actions of the two daughters outside were unrelated to Liu Wenqing. Until the afternoon before yesterday, Liu discovered that Liu Youdong had been abducted and defiled by Chen Zhenghong, a Yangzhou native working as a chauffeur for the Hua family at No. 7 Denian Village across the street. He reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which</p>
<p>Dispatched Chinese Detectives</p>
<p>Zhang Liansen and Western Detective Biekesi to Chen's home, arresting Chen Zhenghong and Liu Youdong. They then went to Room 21 of the Donghai Inn in Yuegui Lane, Wuma Road, and found Liu Youlin. All were taken to the police station. Under interrogation by the police chief, Chen was ordered to be detained, Youdong was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute, and Youlin was told to leave. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Chen Zhenghong to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, and the Jiliang Institute also sent Liu Youdong to the case. Only Liu Youlin did not arrive. Thereupon, Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer,</p>
<p>According to Criminal Law</p>
<p>Article 257, Sections 1 and 2, prosecuted Chen Zhenghong for enticing Liu Youdong, a woman under the age of twenty, to leave her guardian, Liu Wenqing, and engaging in physical relations with her, stating that Youdong and Youlin were both adopted daughters of Liu Wenqing. On the 9th of this month, they disappeared simultaneously. Later, Liu discovered that Youdong was living with Chen Zhenghong, a chauffeur at No. 7 Denian Village across the street. He reported to the police station, who yesterday arrested Chen and Youdong and brought them to the station. However, according to Youdong's statement at the police station,</p>
<p>Her Departure</p>
<p>Was due to Liu Wenqing's expulsion because Liu accused her of improper conduct, damaging his reputation, and thus hastened her expulsion. Moreover, Liu had entrusted a lawyer at No. 1 Zhizhi Road to publish a statement terminating the adoption. Therefore, after Youdong and Youlin left, they stayed overnight with a relative, Ma Jintai, at No. 202 Pushi Road. The next day, the defendant took both girls to his home, where Youdong engaged in relations and cohabited with the defendant, while Youlin found it inconvenient to cohabit and went elsewhere on her own and has also been found. At the same time,</p>
<p>Fan Gang and Dong Yu,</p>
<p>The two lawyers hired by Liu Wenqing, presented a photograph of Chen and Youdong together as evidence. Liu Wenqing testified that he had worked in the Navy Department and had been raising Youdong since she was under one year old, for eighteen years. Since the incident, they had moved to Shanghai. However, Youdong's conduct was improper, and she secretly associated with men, which he did not know until recently, when</p>
<p>Outings Forbidden</p>
<p>Youdong and Youlin left simultaneously the next day. He searched everywhere and only learned yesterday that she had been abducted and defiled by the defendant, so he reported the arrest to the police. Liu Youdong testified that she was nineteen years old and had met the defendant, Chen Zhenghong, in August of last year because Chen lived across the street. They met often, and their feelings deepened. They discussed marriage in the future, and she was willing to commit to him for life. On the 9th of this month, her father, Liu Wenqing, saw a photo of her and Chen together and angrily expelled her and Youlin, and Officer Chen led them to</p>
<p>Huizhong Hotel</p>
<p>Room 402, where they stayed temporarily, preparing to smooth things over with her father after his anger subsided. After two nights, they were helpless, and living in an inn was not a good idea. Having nowhere to go, they called the defendant, who came and took them to his home, where she engaged in relations and cohabited with the defendant. Chen Zhenghong confessed to making a vow with Youdong, saying that on the 11th of this month, he received a call from Youdong, who was at Huizhong Hotel, saying that her father had expelled her, and she could not go home, and that her father had published a statement terminating the adoption, so she asked him to take her in, or she would repay him with death. He had no choice but to take her home temporarily, preparing to ask her father for marriage. Judge Liu Yugui, after reviewing the testimony, ordered Liu Youdong to be taken back by Liu Wenqing temporarily, and the defendant was detained pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of a Murder Case Over a Bun</h3>
<p>Sun Wenqing, an apprentice at the Nanyang Box Shop opened by Yang Kunsheng of Zhenjiang at No. 12 Jinyu Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, bought four beef buns from the Yumeiju Teaching Hall on Pishao Nai Road at 7 p.m. on the 11th of this month. Because the meat filling was undercooked, he took them back to exchange them, and accidentally dropped one bun on the ground, soiling it. Jia Jinshou, a worker at the Teaching Hall, refused to exchange them, leading to an argument. Jia struck Sun's face, and Sun, in a fit of urgency, picked up a stone and threw it at the hall before fleeing back to the shop. Shi Yushan, the owner of Yumeiju, mistakenly believed what his worker said, that Sun had thrown pork skin into the shop, deeming it a violation of religious rules. Shi then waited with a sharp knife and, along with his son Shi Nanhua and workers, led by Shi Shengtian, an apprentice from his shop, went to the Nanyang Box Shop to question the shop owner, Yang Kunsheng, about the crime. Disagreeing, Shi and his son stabbed Yang's back and other places three times with a knife, and he died from his injuries. The French police sent Detective Xu Guilin and others to arrest the murderer Shi Yushan. However, the murder weapon had been hidden and could not be retrieved. Shi Nanhua also fled with the crime. The next day, they reported to the Second Special Court to have the body examined. Yang Chenshi, the wife of the deceased, collected the body for burial. The police continued to arrest the accomplices Jia Jinshou, Wang Sanzi, and Shi Shengtian, and brought them to the Second Special Court for questioning and investigation. The police investigation has concluded, and Detective Xu Guilin escorted Jia and Wang back to the shop to retrieve the murder weapon and a piece of pig's ear as evidence. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Yuan Jiahuan, the police lawyer, stated the case and prosecuted for murder. Yang Chenshi, the widow of the deceased, said that she saw Shi Yushan stab her husband twice and his son stab him once. She tried to go out to call for help but was stopped by those who came with them and punched in her right flank. She requested justice and hired a lawyer to file an incidental private prosecution, seeking compensation for damages. Shi Yushan testified that because the deceased's apprentice had thrown pork into his shop, he went to argue with them but forgot to put down the knife. He was beaten upon entering the deceased's home and did not know how he stabbed the deceased in a state of confusion, and he did not intend to kill him and asked for leniency. Jia, Wang, and Shi all denied being accomplices. At this point, the court deemed the investigation complete and ordered the start of the debate. After the police lawyer debated first, Shi's own lawyer defended him, but Jia, Wang, and Shi, who had not hired lawyers, had no one to defend them. The court ordered the debate to be suspended and rescheduled for the assigned defense lawyers to appear for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Yong'an Silver Company's Directors: Court Strictly Orders Next Appearance; Arrest Warrants to be Issued if No Show; Defendant's Lawyer Describes Fundraising Steps</h3>
<p>The bankruptcy of Yong'an Silver Company has lasted over three months. Deng Qianhuan, Li Du, Wang Jiazhen, Mo Dehui, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Zilian, Gu Chuntao, Peng Baohui, Ye Hancheng, Qian Youju, Lin Qiuhu, Jiang Qi, Dai Kechang, Ou Jiancheng, Shen Zufufu, Wang Yongxin, Luo Huafang and other seventeen people who were shareholders, directors, general managers and managers of the company have been repeatedly evading court appearances or</p>
<p>Resisting Summons After Wang Weiguan, Gao Yiqun, Chen Shengyao, Peng Zican and other creditors filed criminal lawsuits with the First Special District Court for fraud and embezzlement, which has made it impossible to conduct an investigation. Now, Qiu Bokai and other creditors have also filed a lawsuit against Deng Jinghuan and other responsible persons for fraud and embezzlement, as the Xiahui Road branch of the company owes them more than 10,000 yuan in deposits and they were initially blinded by the company's plans to resume operations, so they did not take joint action with Wang Quanguan et al. As the company has now formally announced that it will be liquidated, it seems unlikely that it will resume operations. Thus, the number of cases against Deng et al. has increased from four to five. Fortunately, the details of each case are roughly the same, and the court, for the sake of</p>
<p>Time Economy Decided to try them together. Yesterday afternoon, when it was time for the hearing, Luo Huafang, a newly appointed assistant manager, appeared in court with his defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, but the others were still absent. First, the plaintiffs stated the amount owed to them, and then the court questioned the defendant Luo Huafang. He stated that he was appointed as assistant manager by the new manager, Shen Zufu, on January 21, when the company resumed operations, but he resigned on January 26 and was</p>
<p>Unaware of the Deposit Fraud The representative lawyer of the plaintiffs, Chen Shengyao, et al., Jiang Guofang, immediately announced the results of the plaintiffs' investigation in court, stating that Shen Zufu, Wang, Yongjin, Luo Huafang, and others were all members of the Qian business community. They had a plan in advance for this appointment as managers and assistant managers, each trying to attract deposits, only seeking a large number of depositors, regardless of the short deposit period, even if deposits were made in the morning and withdrawn in the evening, only receiving a small interest, they were happy to accept it. They used this to boast to the shareholders and directors, boasting of their flexible skills, besides this</p>
<p>No Other Strategy The defense lawyer for Mo Jiancheng arrived in court at this time, and Judge Wu asked about the company's recent situation and its attitude towards the creditors. The lawyer stated that the defendants were still trying to raise money, and the current fundraising steps were three: first, they had a title deed worth more than 100,000 yuan and planned to mortgage it to repay the debt. However, the recipient had not yet been found, secondly, they had</p>
<p>Demanded Payment of Unpaid Shares from shareholders who had not yet paid their shares, and thirdly, they had collected money owed to the company in order to repay debts. Not only should the creditors who had filed lawsuits be repaid, but those who had not filed lawsuits should also not be left out. However, since a comprehensive calculation was required, it would take time, so they still requested a postponement. As for the defendants, they did not appear in court because the plaintiffs had filed criminal lawsuits, but if the plaintiffs could forgive them and withdraw the criminal lawsuits on their own initiative, they would be able to come out and discuss a settlement. Judge Wu stated that since each hearing, they had been absent on various pretexts, delaying until now, and there was no</p>
<p>Concrete Solution Indicated, prolonging the litigation period, which was not appropriate. If they still failed to appear at the next hearing, arrest warrants would be issued according to law, and there would be no favoritism. He ordered the lawyer to notify the defendants of this intention, and if there were reasons, they could appear in court to defend themselves, and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the afternoon of April 16. Luo Huafang paid a cash deposit of 5,000 yuan or a store deposit. Lawyer Chen Tingrui, seeing that the time was late, feared that the bail procedures would not be completed in time, so he requested the court to allow him to temporarily bail Luo out, allowing him to formally bail him the next day, otherwise Luo would be detained for at least one night.</p>

<h3>The Xinyie Trust Company: Enthusiastic Subscription for New Houses in the City Center</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Xinyie Trust Company's second construction of houses in the city center is nearing completion. The design is exquisite, ingenious, and free from vulgarity, even more advanced than the first construction. Dozens of people from both local and foreign areas request brochures of the new houses from the company every day. Even remote areas such as Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shantou, and Pingjin Tangshan are also inquiring by letter. The company's construction this time is divided into two types, A and B, which can be paid for in three, four, five, or six years, which is extremely convenient. It is learned that there are many subscribers, and only a few houses remain unsubscribed. At a time when the market is depressed and the real estate industry is declining, the company's houses are so enthusiastically subscribed, which shows that the future development of the city center is very promising.</p>

<h3>Bank of Communications: Graduates from Various Universities Selected and Now Assigned Duties</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Tang Shoumin took office as the general manager of the Bank of Communications, he has been renovating the old and creating the new. In two years, the business situation has made significant progress, such as improving administrative efficiency, and management has become more cautious and strict. Members have been dispatched several times to various branches to check accounts, and cases of fraud have been dealt with in accordance with the law. The reporter previously read Mr. Tang's training speech for special probationary employees of the bank, and its meaning was profound and indeed unique. In addition, Mr. Tang's selection of dozens of graduates from various universities for training has attracted the attention of the public. Therefore, yesterday I went to the bank to investigate the distribution of duties of the graduates from various universities. It was learned that after the students entered the bank last autumn, they were assigned to various departments to rotate and compile reports. They have now completed their probation period. There are currently 13 people assigned to the audit department, all of whom graduated from well-known domestic universities, such as Guanghua, Nankai, Jinan, Shanghai Business School, Yanjing, Xiamen, Soochow, and Zhenjiang, with majors in accounting or economics. They are now all studying accounting in a specially set up accounting training class, from vouchers to settlement. After completing the training, they will work in the audit department and be assigned to various branches to specialize in accounting matters, in order to improve them in the future. Six graduates from specialized departments such as the Central, Beijing, Zhejiang, and Nantong departments have been assigned to the business research office and the economic survey transportation, salt, and cotton industries groups. On the one hand, they study various business problems, and on the other hand, they are sent by the bank to national product factories to study in practice. Graduates from St. John's, Shanghai, Yanjing, Soochow, and Central universities have been assigned to the business and savings departments, a total of about 30 people. Their job assignments are based on the standards of the sciences they studied and their personalities. Among the banks that have selected a large number of university graduates, the Bank of Communications is the most notable. With Mr. Tang's spirit of management and the training of these outstanding young people, the future result is bound to be successful.</p>
<h3>Fu Xiaolan Proposes the Establishment of Siming Cemetery: Letter to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Fu Xiaolan, a prominent Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, yesterday wrote a letter to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai regarding the proposal to establish Siming Cemetery, saying: "Respectfully addressed to Elder Qiaqing and Elder Shenzhi, I read in the newspaper that Chairman Jiang has issued an order to all subordinates to promote the New Deal, and the establishment of public cemeteries is an essential plan for today. It has been found that Shanghai has already established several public cemeteries, such as Wanguo, Yongan, and Shanghai. With the size of our Ningbo, it is unique in its absence, which is a regret for our hometown. In recent years, the number of Ningbo people traveling to Shanghai has increased day by day, and the number should be over one million. With such a large population, it is appropriate to prepare for both life and death. Once an accident occurs, the coffin must be transported back to the hometown, but after arriving in the hometown, there is no suitable place for burial. The pain of death and mourning is the same for all people. Who has no relatives, who can forget them? This is the reason why the Siming Cemetery should be established as soon as possible. The initiation of this matter, in terms of name, should be done by your association requesting the directors of the Siming Public Office to be responsible for the initiation, which is the most appropriate. If the Siming Public Office does not have the time to take care of it, then we plan to ask the elders of your association to initiate it, so that both fellow villagers and non-villagers can find land nearby for burial, saving the trouble of transportation and avoiding the suffering of relocation. This matter concerns the public, so I offer my opinions and contribute to the elders. If you agree, you should start preparing and quickly purchase land of about two or three hundred acres near Shanghai, such as Nanxiang and Jiangwan, with convenient transportation, direct access by boat and car. In addition to the cemetery, the land should also be prepared for the establishment of a funeral home, which also contains commercial properties, in order to be permanent. Once the equipment is completed, the view will be magnificent, and the bereaved family can also reduce their sorrow. This is a move that benefits several parties. It is up to our elders to plan for it. Our fellow villagers' associations have a long-standing reputation for unity, and the Shanghai Siming Public Office is especially well-known both at home and abroad. At that time, there were not as many fellow villagers traveling to Shanghai as there are today. One call to the top was met with such a response. This time, the establishment of Siming Cemetery, based on past events and current trends, will be twice the result with half the effort. Mr. Zong Yao is old and knows that he cannot contribute to his hometown. Whenever he is on vacation, he visits cemeteries everywhere and feels that he is alone in lacking one. He uses his humble opinion and hopes for your consideration. Respectfully await your response. Sincerely, Chuan Zongyao."</p>

<h3>Hu Society Investigates Fellow Villagers' Registration</h3>
<p>The Hu Society of this city is for fellow villagers from the six counties of Hubei, who are living in Shanghai in increasing numbers. However, due to scattered residences and different occupations, it is difficult to gather them together. It is reported that the society requires a precise statistic and liaison with the number and status of fellow villagers in Shanghai. In view of this, the public welfare department of the society has made an investigation form and sent it to members and fellow villagers for completion. In addition, on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of this month, the investigation form will be published in the Shen, Xin, and Chen three newspapers for public registration, so that fellow villagers can cut out and send in the forms, in order to be universal and save procedures.</p>
<h3>Wang Yiting Cables to Invite Duan Zhengyuan to Lecture</h3>
<p>Wang Yiting, director of the Prayer for World Peace Society of this port, cabled yesterday to invite Mr. Duan Zhengyuan of Peiping to give a lecture as soon as possible. The original cable is as follows: "Zhen et al. are shocked by the great powers competing to build murderous weapons, and the catastrophe of mankind is imminent. Based on the great aspiration of self-help and saving people, we have initiated the Prayer for World Peace Conference to promote the true meaning of Confucius's Great Harmony and earnestly invite the benevolent to speak on the scriptures, hoping that the world will hear the Great Way, inspire benevolence, turn violence into auspiciousness, and turn weapons into jade. The people all over the world are in sympathy, and letters and telegrams of support are pouring in every day. People from all over the world and the women's circles have successively established branch associations, and they have repeatedly pleaded by telegram, which proves that the world's hope for peace and reliance on great virtue is extremely urgent. Because of the great virtue, humility, and repeated humility, the date and address of the lecture have not yet been announced. (Omission) We have long known that the master is compassionate and helps the world, and has been moved by this for decades. We hereby jointly apply and earnestly implore the master not to refuse, to set the date and place of the lecture as soon as possible, to quickly bestow virtue, to dispel the evil calamity, and to realize world peace as soon as possible. Then not only China is fortunate, but the world is fortunate, and all generations are fortunate."</p>
<h3>Guangdong Association Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Association in Shanghai held an emergency meeting of the standing directors at its office yesterday. Tang Haian, Yang Meinan, Cui Pingxi, Li Ze, Chen Fengyuan, Chen Qifen, Li Dachao, etc. attended. Chairman Tang presided over the meeting and reported on the association's affairs in the past week. It was discussed that in the Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Guangdong people in Shanghai have made great contributions to industry and commerce and paid more taxes than others, but in the association over the years, no Guangdong industrial and commercial taxpayers have been elected, which is not the purpose of the taxpaying Chinese and is not what the Guangdong people want. Yesterday, a notice was received from the association that the association should strive for election and pay more attention to the participation of Guangdong people. Wen Qinfu and Guo Shun were immediately appointed as representatives to be candidates, and the case of the Guangdong People's Hospital's Rules of Procedure was discussed.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast yesterday at 4:30 PM, stating that the Shandong area, the surrounding areas, and the Yellow Sea are cloudy with strong to very strong northeasterly winds. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are overcast with fog or showers and very strong northeasterly to northerly winds, sometimes cloudy. The East China Sea and Kyushu have strong cyclones with bad weather, either rain or fog, due to a low pressure system passing through and moving northeast. The Taiwan Strait is overcast with fog and unstable winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai was a high of 54.3 and a low of 50.9. The high on the same day last year was 50.9, and the low was 44.1.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Liu Hongxun, who stated that he read an article in the local news section of your newspaper on the 24th of this month concerning his criminal case appeal. However, the wording was ambiguous and did not clarify that it was a renewed ruling on the application to suspend detention, which is easily mistaken for a retrial of the appealed portion of the case. Moreover, the date of the ruling was long ago, before March, which is old news and seems to have lost its news value, and is more likely to cause misunderstanding. I have been specially commissioned by your lawyer to send a letter requesting that the newspapers make corrections, and so I am forwarding this letter to you. Please publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the matter and satisfy public opinion. Respectfully, Attorney Chen Tingrui, March 27.</p>
<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng Bank 1934 Business Report (14)</h3>
<p>As shown in the table above, except for fuel, other food, textiles, metal building materials, chemicals, sundries, etc., have all fallen, with other foods (including tea, sugar, oil, wine, fish, meat, peanuts, etc.) and textiles being the most significant. As for food, the drop was very sharp in the first half of the year, reaching a low of 60.3 (in March), a decrease of 9% compared to the average of the previous year. After July, drought caused disasters, and prices gradually rose, with the annual average differing from the previous year by only 0.5. According to the analysis of the degree of manufacturing and processing, the drop in raw materials in North China was greater than that of manufactured goods, agricultural products were greater than other raw materials, and consumer goods were greater than productive goods (please refer to Table 5). Table 5: Wholesale Price Index of North China (by Manufacturing Category) (1926 = 100)</p>
<p>Year 21 Year 22 Year 23</p>
<p>Raw Materials 97.19 83.20 74.70</p>
<p>Agricultural Products 89.74 73.03 64.26</p>
<p>Animal Products 96.73 83.21 76.51</p>
<p>Forest Products 135.63 128.19 116.58</p>
<p>Mineral Products 101.50 93.62 86.10</p>
<p>Manufactured Goods 124.17 113.39 104.58</p>
<p>Productive Goods 114.59 105.67 100.15</p>
<p>Consumer Goods 131.09 118.83 107.66</p>
<p>The drop in raw materials is inherently beneficial to the manufacturing industry. However, the degree of the drop is not as great as that of consumer goods under manufactured goods. Therefore, the domestic industry remained sluggish this year. According to the analysis of exports and imports, with 1926 as 100, the price index of exports this year was 71.7, a decrease of 10.3% compared to 1933 and 18.7% compared to 1932. The price index of imports this year was 132.1, a decrease of only 0.2% compared to 1933 and only 8.10% compared to 1931. From this, it can be seen that the drop in the price of domestic goods is more severe than that of foreign goods.</p>
<p>(3) Trade: Both imports and exports in foreign trade declined this year. The main reasons are the high silver price, the drop in commodity prices, the low purchasing power, and the stagnation of production. Here is an exploration of the general situation of foreign trade in the past year from various aspects. In terms of trade value this year, imports were 1,029,665,224 yuan, a decrease of 315,901,964 yuan or 23.49% compared to the previous year. Exports were 535,214,279 yuan, a decrease of 76,613,711 yuan or 12.52% compared to the previous year. The total trade volume decreased by 20.05% compared to last year. The trade deficit was 494,450,945 yuan, a decrease of 239,288,253 yuan or 32.61% compared to the previous year. In terms of trade volume, imports decreased by 15% compared to 1933 and 21% compared to 1932. Exports decreased by only 0.4% compared to last year but increased significantly compared to 1932. The decrease in trade value is purely due to the drop in commodity prices. The main reasons for the decrease in import trade volume are the decline of the rural economy and the decrease in general purchasing power. At the same time, the increase in customs duties and smuggling also played a role. The export trade volume is actually in the process of recovery. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>To Understand the Classics, Wait Another Hundred Years</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>By "classics," I mean the "Five Classics" and the writings of the pre-Qin philosophers. By "understand," I mean "understand the sentences and comprehend the principles." "Wait another hundred years" is a true statement, without any exaggeration.</p>
<p>Before the Qing Dynasty, no one had ever truly understood the classics, which is a fact. The New Text School of the Western Han Dynasty put the cloak of the yin-yang and five-elements schools on Confucianism, linking Confucius and the Five Classics together. As a result, the Five Classics were not the original Five Classics, Confucianism was not the original Confucianism, and Confucius was not the original Confucius. People like Dong Zhongshu explained the Spring and Autumn Annals, and Liu Xiang explained the Great Plan, with the aim of catering to the minds of the rulers and using it as a tool to gain promotion and wealth. Such explanations of the classics will never be understood, so although the New Text School played with subtle meanings, it is clear that the classics were not understood. The Old Text School of the Eastern Han Dynasty regarded the Duke of Zhou as a sage and Confucius as a transmitter who did not create, and they made considerable efforts in terms of textual research. However, judging from the fact that they spent two or three hundred thousand words explaining the Yao Dian's "Yue Ruo Ji Gu," they would not have any brilliant insights. Moreover, the top scholars devoted all their energy to arguing with the New Text scholars, with too much emphasis on ideological disputes, and abandoning the original meaning. It can be seen that the Old Text School also did not understand the classics. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Zheng Xuan's work of integrating the New and Old Texts was meaningful, but besides textual research, his understanding of principles and righteousness was too weak, and he did not achieve much, so he cannot be considered to have understood the classics. After the Wei and Jin Dynasties, only the three books of the Book of Changes, Laozi, and Zhuangzi were appreciated by the literati and had special insights. Other parts were neglected, and the chapters and sentences of the New Text School were gradually lost. The annotations of the Tang Dynasty, because they valued northern learning and despised southern learning, actually introduced some false learning, and the face of the classics was completely changed, so it was even more impossible to understand the classics. The Neo-Confucians of the Song and Ming Dynasties used Zen as their soul and revived the corpse of Confucianism. Their reading of the classics was all about borrowing wine from others' cups to quench their own sorrows. For example, Zhu Xi's Annotations on the Four Books is just Zhu Xi's lecture notes on philosophy, and its meaning sometimes "has no connection with" the original meaning of Confucius and Mencius. Pursuing understanding by this path, its end point is India, standing with Shakyamuni. In addition, the conservatism of scholars in the Ming Dynasty made a mess of the classics, and the further they were from the classics, the more impossible it was to seek understanding.</p>
<p>The work of organizing the classics and moving towards "understanding" began with the Qing Dynasty classicists. Gu Tinglin's comparative research, Hu Wei, and Ge Ruohu's identification of forged books opened the way for Qing Dynasty textual criticism. They worked hard to remove the brambles that previous generations had added to the classics, one by one, to restore the original face of the classics. Their spirit and methods were both scientific and empirical. The achievements of the textual critics after the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods were astonishing. Dai Dongyuan said, "If you aspire to hear the Way, you must empty what you rely on. The textual research of the Han Confucians has teachers and inheritance, and sometimes it is also coincidental. The people of the Jin Dynasty added more coincidences and fabrications. The people of the Song Dynasty relied on their own thoughts to make judgments. Therefore, what they inherited was wrong, and what was not wrong was what they abandoned. The Confucians since the Song Dynasty have insisted on using their own views to stand for the meaning of the ancient sages, but they did not really know the language and words. When it comes to the affairs of the world, they forcibly judge and implement what they call reason, but they cannot really obtain the origins and subtleties of things. Therefore, the Great Way is lost and actions are wrong." He directly pointed out the situation of the ancients blindly explaining the classics. He also said: "All that I seek in the lost classics is to fear that the words of the sages will be obscured in later generations. However, in seeking and obtaining, there are those who have achieved full understanding, and those who have not yet achieved full understanding. The so-called full understanding must be examined in ancient times and nothing is not coherent, and it must conform to the Way without leaving any remaining arguments, examining everything in detail, and observing both the beginning and the end. As for relying on hearsay to guess what is right, choosing the best from various opinions to decide its superiority, making arguments based on empty words to determine its theory, and relying on isolated records to believe its understanding, although tracing the stream can know the source, you cannot see the guidance of the abyss spring with your own eyes, and following the root can reach the tip, you cannot pick up the branches and examine the divergence with your own hands, all of which have not yet achieved full understanding." He also stated the attitude and methods of how to seek understanding. After the textual critics' identification of forgeries, collation, and textual research, the Five Classics could be roughly understood, and the philosophers were also gradually becoming understandable. However, the work of the textual critics is scattered in such a vast Qing Jing Jie (Explanations of the Classics of the Qing Dynasty), and the Continuation of the Qing Jing Jie. Later generations have no energy or time to seek understanding from there. Therefore, the annotations of the Song and Ming Neo-Confucians and the annotations of the Tang Dynasty are still circulating in society. The work of settling accounts is already starting now. The writings of Mozi, Zhuangzi, and others have excellent annotations coming out. In forty or fifty years, the Five Classics and others will also have definitive collected annotations. The current young people do not need to be impatient. It is not too late to let the people of forty or fifty years from now read the classics.</p>
<p>What must be specifically mentioned is: The great event of the discovery of oracle bones at Yin Ruins (Anyang) in the 24th and 25th years of the Guangxu reign, and the excavation work carried out by the Academia Sinica in the Anyang area in recent years. The oracle bone inscriptions provide underground historical materials for the Yin and Zhou dynasties. With the research on oracle bone inscriptions, the study of the Book of Documents has opened up a new world. Wang Guowei's New Evidence of Ancient History, Gu Jiegang's Lectures on Ancient History, and Guo Moruo's Research on Ancient Society have been published, and Sun Xingyan's Annotations and Commentaries on the Ancient and Modern Texts of the Book of Documents has become unimportant. The Academia Sinica's underground excavation work is actively underway, with a large number of new discoveries every year. Regarding the culture of the late Yin Dynasty, the cultural exchange between Bronze Age Western Europe and East Asia, the system of ancient palaces and Mingtang, the method of building walls in the Yin Dynasty, the system of coffins in the Yin and Zhou dynasties, the system of ancient chariots...there are new understandings at present. The ancient history of thirty or fifty years from now will not know what new face it will be changed into! The study of oracle bone inscriptions must wait one hundred years to be completed. At that time, the ancient history of Yin and Zhou will not know what new face it will be changed into. In the West, the ancient history of Egypt was originally very absurd. In the second half of the nineteenth century, archaeologists worked in the wilderness excavating ancient Egyptian tombs and racked their brains in the study to interpret the Egyptian writings, and actually wrote a new page in the history of Egypt, an ancient history that scholars before the eighteenth century had never dreamed of. The underground historical materials we have obtained are so rich that we may be able to write them more completely than the history of Egypt.</p>
<p>Therefore, to understand the classics, do not be impatient. Please wait another hundred years and wait for the archaeologists to excavate and research.</p>
<h3>Night Market of Small Stalls</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>In the metropolis night of neon lights, cars, and fashionable girls, one can no longer see such a night market.</p>
<p>Such a night market is still medieval.</p>
<p>Being a lonely person myself, walking on the street of such an old-century style night, I also feel that the color combination of the painting is very harmonious.</p>
<p>In the night street, in the half-open shops, gasoline lamps are lit, and kerosene street lamps are installed in deserted places. Under the dim and hazy yellow light, the best thing to see is piles of small stalls standing in rows.</p>
<p>In front of the shops, at the city gate, at the corners of the walls, and at the bends of the streets, all are set up with small stalls, simply made! A small board table, with very short legs, on which all kinds of food are laid out; under a pair of small kerosene lamps, a pile of purplish-red and brown pork and hare legs, and chopped halves of chicken are reflected... A person sits beside the stall waiting for each customer to make a few "dazi" (local people call copper coins "dazi") worth of transactions.</p>
<p>There are really too many kinds of stalls, it's hard to remember.</p>
<p>There are also many stalls selling a pot of noodle porridge, and you often see two or three people huddled at the very low stall, eating from a bowl. In this situation, I always think of the bleak life of the people—</p>
<p>Under the dim light, a few swarthy faces are reflected, sipping a bowl of noodle porridge that looks like paste.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many small stalls frying sesame cakes. The stalls have kerosene lamps without shades, and black smoke billows upwards. In the frying pan, there is a strong and greasy smell of oil. Many children's little black hands are stretched out around the stall waiting.</p>
<p>There are also stalls selling fruits and small sundry items, but it seems that there are too few patrons, and the stall owner is always staring and leisurely watching the street scene.</p>
<p>A street with dozens of small stalls, each stall lit with different kinds of lamps. The more sophisticated stalls are equipped with square glass kerosene lamps. The night market is also decorated into a lively form.</p>
<p>Walking on the street of the night market with a friend, that friend said to me:</p>
<p>—Here, there is only a night market of small stalls!</p>
<p>—However, some stalls are not doing any business at all, right?</p>
<p>—That's right! There are many stalls that do only ten or twenty copper coins of business in an evening!</p>
<p>—However, they have to rely on this small amount to live.</p>
<h3>War Notes (13)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tokunaga Sunao, translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>It was just as if everyone was chanting sutras together.</p>
<p>The company commander wanted to draw his command saber several times, but hesitated. Finally, when most of the dark shadows approached within a hundred meters, a scout ran back to report:</p>
<p>"Lieutenant, the soldiers in front, the ××××× company and the × company, are retreating in defeat. It's over."</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised and went closer to take a look. What do you say that the shouting was like? It turned out to be the crying of the wounded soldiers who were retreating in defeat. It was as if the crying of the big men had turned into empty shells.</p>
<p>"Almost everyone in that company was injured. Because there had been a very fierce battle over there (I have forgotten the place name). That strange cry still remains in my ears; but, that kind of madman's cry, I only understood the situation when I myself was injured at Shoushan Fort."</p>
<p>Brother A-Xiong couldn't hold up his rice bowl, it was so clumsy.</p>
<p>"It's better to die in battle than to live reluctantly."</p>
<p>I remember: Brother A-Xiong said this and covered his face with his left hand holding chopsticks, weeping. (End)</p>
<h3>Minhang Travelogue (2)</h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>I don't particularly like a spacious seat either. After passing Bansong Garden, I went to the bow to look far away. The banks gradually became desolate, with only some factories intermittently. There is no road along the riverbank, nor are there trees, and I am afraid that there are no reeds even in autumn. The development of Shanghai is really too deformed. Not to mention a long dike with a willow tree and a peach tree to embellish a beautiful scenery, so that the few countable peach blossoms in Longhua are always regarded as treasures by short-sighted urbanites. Paving a road along the river, as usual planting some French parasol trees or the like, tourists will benefit from it. And after this area has convenient water and land transportation, it will also be prepared for more factories to be established here enthusiastically. Isn't this location better than the banks of the Suzhou River?</p>
<p>The boat ticket has many wharves printed between Shanghai and Minhang, but in reality only three are berthed, all in Pudong. The third, Zhagang, is located exactly at the bend where the east-west flow of the Huangpu River turns into a north-south flow. After Zhagang, Minhang can be seen. Here, the river surface has narrowed a lot, and the water is not yellow but slightly light green. I wonder if the muddy water in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River is the water from the Yangtze River being flushed in by the tide? Or is it stirred up by ships? In the past, I thought that the water of the Huangpu River was naturally supposed to be the same color as the river water (people living on the banks of the Yangtze River call the Yangtze River the "river"). The water I have seen that is called "river" water seems to be all muddy yellow. The water of the West River, which is famous for its cleanliness, is also very yellow. The Guijiang River is very clear, but the locals call it the Fu River, and the river surface is indeed very narrow, seeming to be only half the size of the Pujiang River there in Minhang, so it is not considered a "river." I never expected that this misunderstanding could originally indicate to me the Huangpu.</p>
<p>It was past eleven o'clock when I arrived in Minhang. I knew that the long-distance bus to Shanghai would not leave until one o'clock in the afternoon, but the first thing I did was to ask where the bus station was. The police at the pier were probably surprised that I had come by boat and would immediately take a bus to leave, so they sized me up before telling me. So I walked west to the road. This road is also not exactly the western end of Minhang's streets. The ferry of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is on the riverbank at the end of this road, but the Hu-Min Road station is at the third street intersection inside. I saw the station, but without going there, I turned into Minhang's city streets from the second street, and walked east to a crossroads, which is the most lively place in Minhang. But recalling Shanghai there, it was already as if it were another world. Turning back to the riverbank from the crossroads, and walking east to a riverbank, I didn't go past because I saw very few houses east of the river on the boat. Then I turned back to the crossroads from the second street. Seeing the desolation of the third street at the second crossroads, I went straight north. The north street was also very quiet, and there were no more streets on either side, only some winding alleys, probably residential areas. The length of the north street is roughly equal to the east-west street. This small town, facing the river on one side, the river on another, and bordering the road on another, is roughly a square. After I finished walking the north street, it was still early, and I didn't know what famous places Minhang had, so I wandered around the streets and alleys.</p>
<h3>Windlass</h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>In the labor of going back and forth,</p>
<p>Suspended a heavy burden,</p>
<p>Like an uneasy heart</p>
<p>Suspended on a nervous mind.</p>
<p>Shake the handle,</p>
<p>Listen to a bitter rustle, rustle.</p>
<p>Catch a breath,</p>
<p>Think of a series of unspeakable sufferings.</p>
<p>Bend down,</p>
<p>See how high the burden has been raised;</p>
<p>Look up,</p>
<p>See if the water has flowed to the ridge field?</p>
<p>Still have to shake,</p>
<p>Still have to shake,</p>
<p>Still have to listen to the bitter rustle, rustle,</p>
<p>Listen to the bitter rustle, rustle.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>My father is already buried in the mountains. This time, my return to Shaoxing is simply to see my mother and, incidentally, to discuss some matters with my third younger brother, who is resting at home to recover from an illness. Seated in the charcoal-burning automobile, after passing Qianqing, we soon proceeded along the canal, from where we could see the winding Kuaiji Mountains at any time. The canal was brimming with water, and large, white-sailed wine boats, black-awning pleasure boats, two- and four-tiered Ming tile boats, snail-covered rocking boats, small paddle boats, and shallow-water steamers towing "chicken leopards" crowded one another, coming and going incessantly, like "flowing water and dragon horses" on a prosperous street. This is certainly a special characteristic of water villages, made even more lively because it's on the Shanyin Road. The rapeseed flowers in the fields were already yellow, and the alfalfa was a vibrant green, also about to bloom. Piles of empty wine jars as high as small mountains and long, neat rows of stone walls, as the wandering scholar Yu of Shenyang pointed out some time ago, are indeed unique sights of the hometown.</p>
<p>After getting off the car at the Zunyi Bridge, I crossed to the Hualong Bridge by small rocking boat. Following the winding stone-paved path, I slowly walked home. When entering the village, I first arrived at the place where I used to catch crickets with my cousin when we were young, a place with a lot of hibiscus trees that bloom with purple trumpet-shaped flowers.</p>
<p>Transportation is indeed more convenient now. After a leisurely lunch and a pleasant chat, I set off for Hangzhou with plenty of time to spare. Eager to carefully revisit the scenery of my hometown, I had long wanted to walk directly to the bus station; I took advantage of this extra time to do so. My third younger brother accompanied me to the wooden bridge at Fangjia Lou. To get to Jiedu Nunnery, I had to take a ferry. It had been over twenty years since I last used the ferry. Stepping into the tofu-square-like boat, I still stood firmly; things learned well in childhood are indeed not easily forgotten. The river was wide, and pulling the rope made of rice straw slowly by myself, I didn't feel frightened or strenuous, because it was quite enjoyable. I wanted to walk, and taking a ferry was also a kind of goal. But when I arrived at the ferry landing, I didn't immediately get on the boat; instead, I first took a trip to the Jiedu Nunnery. This is a place for cricket fighting, with a long history, and it becomes lively in the autumn. The "winning the championship" of cricket fighting is also held here.</p>
<p>My hometown, with its seventy-two "lou" (ditches or sluices), is more like land on the water than water in the land; viewed from a high place, it just feels like chunks of land floating on the water. After walking a little over half a kilometer, passing by the Huangcheng Temple, I arrived at another ferry landing.</p>
<p>Huangcheng Temple is large in scale and very famous, with many monks inside. Legend has it that Emperor Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty once fled to this temple, and because the monks came out to help, half of them were killed by Wuzhu of the Jin Dynasty, who had a big nose. "Half of the monks of Huangcheng Temple" is a common saying in my hometown. People often don't explicitly say the word "half," using "monks of Huangcheng Temple" to mean that.</p>
<p>This ferry landing is on one side of the canal. Although this section of the canal is not particularly wide, there are many boats coming and going, so it's necessary to be careful when taking the ferry. The ferry was moored on the opposite bank, and no one was pulling it over, so I had to pull the empty ferry over myself first. The river was small, but the ferry rope was very thick, also made of rice straw. I had just crossed halfway when the Yue'an steamer, towing three company boats, came along, rumbling and roaring, and the water surface swelled with large waves. The ferry swayed as if encountering a storm at sea; I only found it interesting.</p>
<p>After crossing this river, I could see the water tower at the bus station as soon as I got ashore. All the way along the canal, the automobile road ran parallel to the old official road. I didn't walk on the automobile road, but strolled slowly on the official road, to see more of the scenery on the river. Many egrets were fishing; these creatures, also called water crows, eat only a little tofu or small fish every day, but try their best to catch big fish to flatter their masters, becoming fierce claws for their masters, and are the most beloved pets of the people in my hometown.</p>
<p>Looking back at Dongpu Village, the houses were faintly visible. I used to think that with banditry rampant everywhere, my hometown could still live in peace; this return home shattered that notion. Just the night before, in the Hua Zhaimen at the bottom of the same "lou" as my tomb, robbers broke in through the cracks in the partition wall, and looted over four hundred yuan worth of jewelry and clothing. This may still be an isolated incident, but the enthusiasm is chilling. Bixiao, the only educational institution in the village, was founded by Martyr Xu Xilin and had a basic fund of over three hundred mu of fields. It once established two branch schools and educated thousands of students at the same time. Because of poor harvests and heavy taxes, it couldn't sustain itself and is now closed. My family, from me to my eighth younger sister, all came from this school. But my nephews, when they reach school age, have nowhere to study. It is said that last semester, a few old gentlemen who had served as members of parliament and successful candidates in the former Qing Dynasty volunteered their services and勉强maintained it for a few days. Their calligraphy is certainly excellent, but they are somewhat out of touch with children; now, even that is no longer being done!</p>

<h3>Entrance Examinations for Colleges and Above Should Adhere to Standards</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) The Ministry of Education ordered all colleges and universities: For the entrance examinations for new students to colleges and universities, all examination subjects and the level of each subject, from the 22nd academic year, should still be handled in accordance with the Provisional Standards for High School Courses. From the 25th academic year, they should be handled in accordance with the current curriculum standards. The Ministry previously issued instructions in the 21st year, ordering compliance. Both of the above curriculum standards have been announced and implemented by the Ministry in the 18th and 21st years, respectively. After reviewing the entrance examination questions previously submitted by various schools, some were too easy and failed to meet the prescribed standards, which is inappropriate. Some school questions, especially in subjects such as mathematics, even exceeded the standards, or in subjects other than foreign languages, questions were set in foreign languages and answers were limited to foreign languages, which is also inappropriate. It is hereby re-ordered that the examination subjects for this year's entrance examinations for all schools must be based on the above provisional standards for question setting to match the level, and the entire set of examination questions for each subject should be sent to the Ministry for record after the examination. A copy of the Provisional Standards for High School Courses and the Teaching Material Outline will be issued for compliance.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Per Capita Annual Expenditure on Higher Education Students Since the Founding of the Republic</h3>
<p>The trends in national higher education since the founding of the Republic, such as the number of schools, the number of students, and the amount of funding, have been published in previous reports. The per capita annual expenditure per student for each year is summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Universities: Per capita annual expenditure per student in the first year of the Republic was 489 yuan, 327 yuan in the second year, 1,019 yuan in the third year, 482 yuan in the fourth year, 306 yuan in the fifth year, 483 yuan in the fourteenth year, 594 yuan in the seventeenth year, 746 yuan in the eighteenth year, 693 yuan in the nineteenth year, 799 yuan in the twentieth year, and 826 yuan in the twenty-first year. (2) Colleges: Per capita annual expenditure per student in the first year of the Republic was 81 yuan, 90 yuan in the second year, 105 yuan in the third year, 140 yuan in the fourth year, 173 yuan in the fifth year, 446 yuan in the sixth year, 305 yuan in both the seventh and eighth years, 202 yuan in the ninth year, 293 yuan in the fourteenth year, 275 yuan in the seventeenth year, 386 yuan in the eighteenth year, 385 yuan in the nineteenth year, 400 yuan in the twentieth year, and 539 yuan in the twenty-first year. (Explanation) The highest per capita annual expenditure per student in universities was in the third year of the Republic (1,019 yuan) because there were only seven public and private universities and independent colleges in that year, and the funding was over 2.4 million, so the per capita expenditure per student was higher. The per capita annual expenditure per student in colleges was around 200 yuan from the ninth to the seventeenth year of the Republic, and increased to a maximum of 539 yuan in the twenty-first year.</p>

It is said that the trip lasted two months, and the places passed through included Singapore, Zhubaba Xia, Mabo, Malacca, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Penang, and Saigon. In each place, the overseas Chinese specially formed a committee to welcome the East Asia Southern Tour Team and gave them a warm welcome and reception. They competed dozens of times and won all the matches except for two matches against men, and were praised. Song Faxiang, Consul General of the Dutch East Indies in Batavia, Surabaya, also sent a letter to the team, promising to bear the travel expenses and welcoming them to compete. However, the team leader, Principal Chen, was deeply concerned that too many missed classes would affect their studies, so he sent a letter politely declining. The school's faculty and staff were exhausted from the successful trip and the long journey, and held a reception at Minghu Spring last night to celebrate.</p>
<h3>West Light Cross-Country Team Actively Prepares; International Private Cross-Country Race Scheduled for the Morning of the 31st of This Month; Biel and Haha Teams Are Very Strong</h3>
<p>For the sake of studying skills and training experience, the West Light Cross-Country Team specially invited the West German Biel and Russian Haha teams last spring to hold a private international triangular cross-country championship. As a result, the West Light team won the championship due to its average talent, causing the blue-eyed people to look at each other in dismay. The splendid Leah Cup was won by the West Light team, which was organized by the Chinese. In the blink of an eye, time flies, and it is again a time when spring is in full bloom and athletes are active. These three groups will continue to race, and the winner will keep the Leah Cup. It is now scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 31st of this month at Pudong Qichang Station Pudong Avenue. The road there is half flat, and the environment is elegant, which is very suitable for cross-country races. It is learned that in order to maintain its past honor and spirit, the West Light team, in addition to the original coaches Shen Kunnan and Han Kuiyong, has decided to invite Shen Yuguang to serve as the team's instructor to facilitate the competition. According to the strength of the Biel and Haha teams, they are still very strong. Whether West Light can maintain the championship this year depends on the efforts of the athletes. The West Light team's selection of players has been properly arranged by the team captain, Wu Zhenqing. In addition to the official Group A competition, there are more than ten team members in Group B who will also participate in the performance (but will not be scored).

<h3>Rescuing Industry and Commerce and Safeguarding National Products</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Recently, calls for rescuing industry and commerce have been resounding everywhere. Indeed, our country's industry and commerce, which are on the verge of collapse, are struggling on the line of bankruptcy. If our national public does not provide practical assistance, then the disintegration of the entire national economy will be unthinkable. However, here, we should also know that the foundation of industry and commerce is built on the development of national products. In recent years, the exhaustion of national products industry has been threatened externally by the imperialist market monopoly and commodity dumping, and internally by the pressure of rural bankruptcy and market depression. Sales are decreasing day by day, and prices are falling. The trend of decline is naturally getting worse. Therefore, when we talk about rescuing universal industry and commerce today, we should first start with safeguarding the "national product production industry" that is in its budding stage.</p>
<p>Speaking of strategies for safeguarding national products, we must first recognize the crisis facing the future of national products and where its crux lies. We know that the national products industry is now in a new situation. Since the United States implemented its silver policy, domestic silver has been flowing out in droves, leading to panic in the financial sector, and the contraction of industrial lending and the unsound credit system have made those engaged in business uneasy and unable to move forward. "Stranded" and "bankrupt" are frequently heard, and the entire business community is naturally suffering endless destruction from external evil forces under this gloomy atmosphere. Therefore, at this time, if we want to rescue industry and commerce, we must first safeguard national products, and to safeguard national products, we must pay attention to the implementation of the following two main tasks:</p>
<p>(1) Thorough Cooperation between the Financial Industry and the National Goods Industry: The progress of national goods must be promoted in many ways, and economic assistance is especially important. Facing this imminent crisis, our financial industry itself should have considerable awareness. It should be known that under normal circumstances, importing one more yuan of foreign goods or exporting one less yuan of local products will actually cause the financial industry to overflow with one more yuan of capital, and the result of the depletion of national strength will also affect the prosperity of the financial industry. Therefore, the recent resolution of the Money Trade Association to refuse to operate foreign luxury goods lending, and the decision of many banks to cancel import mortgage and lending for foreign goods other than machinery and necessary raw materials, are naturally good news for the future of national goods. It is even more important to hope that the financial industry will plan to create large amounts of industrial credit to promote domestic industry and the export of local goods and cooperate with the national goods industry in a practical way.</p>
<p>(2) The Efforts of Our Own National Goods Industry: On the one hand, resolve competition among peers and deal with foreign goods together, and on the other hand, seek to improve technology, reduce costs, and promote them widely at the lowest price at home and abroad.</p>
<p>In short, "safeguarding national products" is to "reduce excess imports," and "reducing excess imports" can prevent "silver from flowing out," and "financial stability," and the business climate of the entire industry and commerce can gradually recover from the abyss of near bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Contribution Speech</p>
<h3>National Goods Industry and Acceptance Bills</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>An acceptance bill is when the seller sells or ships the goods, draws a bill requesting the buyer to sign the date of exchange, and agrees to pay the full amount on the due date. The buyer of the goods is named "acceptor" in the Legislative Yuan's bill law. This type of bill is called an "acceptance bill." After the seller accepts this type of bill, he can discount it to the bank or money shop. If the bank or money shop discounts this type of bill to the Central Bank or other banks, it is called rediscounting.</p>
<p>In the past, the commercial field was accustomed to only two types of goods trading: cash payment and credit. But now the scope of commerce and industry is expanding day by day. If transactions must be paid in cash, it is not only difficult for the buyer to cope, but also difficult to expand transactions. If it is completely on credit, the seller must prepare several years of funds and also feel the lack of flexible turnover. Only this acceptance bill is enough to solve the difficulties of both parties. It allows the seller to turn over his economy, and the buyer can pay on a scheduled basis without being unprepared. The bank and money shop have the guarantee of solid credit, which can not only circulate their funds but also help the development of industry and commerce. In this era when the national goods industry urgently needs to expand and suffers from insufficient funds, acceptance bills are indeed the safest and most convenient procedure, so that the factory, the customer, and the financial industry form a chain relationship and become a whole. It is the best way to develop national goods. Jin Guobao in the financial industry was the first to advocate it, and recently Wang Yansong has also been trying his best to promote it. In the silk and satin industry, factories such as Meiya Silk Weaving have been practicing it for a long time. Recently, the silk and satin industry has unanimously followed suit. Yang Yinpu, Zhang Naiqi, and Zhang Xiaomei published a research report on industrial, commercial, and financial issues, and also used the backbone of the modern silver and money market as bill discounting. They strongly advocate that all parties use the acceptance of bills to turn the fixed claims on the account into circulating bills. With a single transfer, tens of thousands of yuan of fixed claims on the account on the market can be used to obtain financial accommodation through bill discounting, which is enough to save the current crisis in the industrial and commercial sector. For the financial industry itself, the creation of bank acceptance bills and the implementation of rediscounting methods are also necessary. It must be known that the use of bank acceptance bills can also turn goods in storage into circulating bills, which makes the own turnover more convenient. It can be seen that the method of acceptance bills is advocated by all parties. At this time when national goods factories are facing sluggish goods and difficult financial turnover, they should be open and honest with the financial industry, agree on a method, and earnestly try it out. The financial industry should also eliminate private interests and picky bad habits, bend over and seek perfection, and give the factory all kinds of conveniences. If this method is effective, then the national goods industry and the financial industry will both benefit from it, and its development can be predicted.</p>
<h3>"Using National Products" as a Lifeline for Reviving the Market</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the former chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce who returned from the Philippines, made remarks about rescuing the declining market, which are worthy of our attention and deep thought! He said: "Reviving the market is an active action, while rescuing the market is a passive measure. If we want to talk about revival, the government must encourage national products, and the people must use national products. All other things are not fundamental." These few words really hit the nail on the head!</p>
<p>We know: What is the reason for the continuous outflow of silver? This is caused by the bloodless dumping of foreign goods and the shameless purchase of foreign goods by our compatriots! Those with foresight and vision warn us that if Chinese people are still enthusiastic about foreign goods, especially modern women, and do not wake up! I deeply believe that the national treasure—silver—will run out! The filling of paper money will not be able to be redeemed. At that time, foreign economic chains will strangle 400 million Chinese people. Then, it will be too late to regret!</p>
<p>I believe that everyone using national products is not only enough to revive the commercial market but also to preserve the original vitality, which is to preserve their own lives! Dear compatriots, wake up quickly!</p>
<h3>National Products in Penglai</h3>
<p>— Qiu Ping</p>
<p>Penglai Market is the only national product market in Nanshi. Although it does not have ten or twenty-story buildings, nor does it have great advertisements that can tempt people to buy, the rectangular cement roads inside the flat-style market building are still considered clean and quiet. However, it has everything for general supply. Therefore, it is very convenient for residents in Nanshi. So, Penglai Market can indeed be called the only market in Nanshi.</p>
<p>After school, students from various schools in Nanshi go there to take a walk or shop. However, I feel that there are two shortcomings in the market. So, I specifically borrow a corner of this publication to offer a little humble opinion, hoping that the market authorities will adopt it.</p>
<p>(1) The narrow ring road is often crowded with people coming and going, especially on holidays. Under such circumstances, the most worrying thing is the coming and going of vehicles. Therefore, the market often has rickshaws, bicycles, and chartered cars entering and exiting, resulting in accidents, knocking down children! Tearing the clothes of tourists! As a result, disputes often occur. I have also been a victim of having my clothes torn by a car. Such things are too scary. So, I hope the authorities should immediately prohibit all vehicles from entering, knocking down tourists, and tearing clothes. Although these are small things, if this continues, it will inevitably cause losses to the market's business.</p>
<p>(2) As mentioned above, the roads inside Penglai Market are very narrow. In addition, several shops put advertising signs in the center of the road, and several others move all their goods in front of their shops—their position occupies about one-third of the street—. Their purpose is nothing more than advertising! Although their intentions are good, their actions encroach on public interests and hinder public behavior, which should not happen at least.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that the authorities will limit it.</p>

<h3>"Having It Both Ways"</h3>
<p>— Gui Li</p>
<p>Things in the world are very difficult to have it both ways!</p>
<p>For example: The air we breathe every day is often full of various bacteria. These bacteria inevitably stick to people's skin. If they enter the body through pores or minor injuries, they can cause dangerous diseases! So, you must use medicated soap to bathe and wash your hands every day to sterilize and protect your skin, which is the best way to prevent it; but we know that medicated soap is a foreign product! Buying foreign goods is sorry to the motherland.</p>
<p>Without medicated soap, the skin has no protection. Using medicated soap will cause the rights and interests to flow out. Isn't this a clear proof that "things in the world are very difficult to have it both ways"?</p>
<p>However, recently, a gratifying piece of news has come, that is, the Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, which is known to Chinese people for manufacturing national laundry soap, has recently produced a "Guben Medicated Soap". This medicated soap has been manufactured after many years of research. Its content and effectiveness are above those of foreign goods. From now on, Chinese people can not only keep their bodies clean and hygienic but also use cheap and beautiful national products, which can be said to be "having it both ways"! At the same time, I hope that all domestic national product factories will take the path of having it both ways.</p>

<h3>How to Rescue Industry and Commerce?</h3>
<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial panic and the cries for help from industry and commerce have become a major problem. However, various parties are only studying "what to rescue with"? But few have heard the call of "how to rescue"? "What to rescue with"? It is indeed an extremely difficult problem. Regardless of whether the source is from the government, the financial sector, or any other aspect, the result of piecing together is a "cutting flesh to mend sores" plan. In short, "one porridge and one meal, one should think of where it comes from is not easy." The more difficult it is to obtain, the more valuable it must be used. Even if the quantity is small, it must be used with value, then someone will be willing to take out a large quantity. Best of all, after this rescue, there will be no need for a second rescue. If you have no strength today and are rescued by others, and tomorrow you have the strength to rescue others, then you will not fail the hard work of this rescue. How do industry and commerce need rescue? The authorities of industry and commerce will definitely say: This is a matter of the overall situation "not a crime of war." That's right. But looking around, thinking calmly, our industry and commerce, there are indeed many with substantial and well-organized content, and there are also those with substantial but not well-organized. Now, in the time of "commercial war" with various countries in the world, at least one must be equipped with what the Romance of the Three Kingdoms says: "The military appearance is neat, the orders are clear, and the soldiers are well-fed." If the soldiers are not well-fed, of course it will not work. If the soldiers are well-fed, but the military appearance is not neat and the orders are not clear, how can they be lucky enough to win the battle! "Commercial war" with their own people is already impossible, let alone "commercial war" with various countries in the world? Rescuing the content is not substantial, and requires "money". "Money" is certainly important, but how can "talent without money" not be important? Isn't there a saying that "it is easy to open a shop, but difficult to employ people"? If the gentlemen of the industry and commerce authorities obtain the result of business development, it is not just relying on your capital, but a large part still relies on your talents. If you admit that "it is easy to open a shop, but difficult to employ people," and someone hands you "money" to help you enrich the content, and makes all the conditions that can make you successful complete, and eliminates all the conditions that can make you fail, then the modest and responsible industry and commerce authorities, I am afraid, will accept it gladly.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Buyers Have the Upper Hand, the Gold Market Rebounds After Falling, the Exchange Rate Returns to Tight Balance, and the Balance Tax Rises by Half a Percent, Floating Shorts Rush to Cover, Resulting in a Rebound of Six Yuan and One Cent</h3>
<p>After the gold market fell sharply yesterday, the people's hearts were sluggish. However, the buyer's camp has an absolute advantage in the chips, and the shorts are in a suppressed position. Therefore, as soon as the market fell yesterday, the rebound took advantage of the opportunity to rise. Floating shorts were squeezed one after another, and the rebound after the fall was quite rapid. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw a sharp rise in the UK and the US. However, after the big bar closed, it was said that there was a transaction at the listed price of 43.75. Although the London forward silver market rose, it was not much. The exchange rate rose and fell slightly. London raw gold shrank by half a penny. When the over-the-counter preliminary trading opened, it fell to 46-47 yuan. However, due to the chip relationship, demand exceeded supply, and the situation stabilized. Later, the Central Bank followed suit and announced that the UK and the US had risen, the Customs gold unit had fallen by 1.2 cents, and the standard price of the bid gold had dropped to 891 yuan and 7 corners, rising and falling again.

Unexpectedly, the silver balance tax, which had been unattended for a long time, rose by half a percent due to the sharp rise in foreign silver, accounting for 6.25%. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling and 8 pence. Although there was a lack of huge stimulus, the scattered short psychology was already in distress. At this point, a short squeeze suddenly occurred, and a rising wind appeared. Large households took advantage of the high to sell bars, and Guangbang also had supply. Sassoon came to sell out instead, and gradually the market fell. However, the long side was calm, and floating shorts still covered when they saw the low. The people's hearts were prosperous. Therefore, as soon as the large households had a buying appetite, there was a lack of supply, and the rising wind became even more intense. The trend was even more charming at noon. Although the market situation was firm for half a day, there were still struggles in the middle. The swap premium was posted by the long side at 3 yuan weak. The market situation for half a day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 846 yuan and a half, down 5 yuan and 1 corner from the previous closing. Changda, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Dada, Dafayong, Fuan, sold from 7 yuan to 4 yuan and 2 corners.

Fuxingyong took advantage of the high to supply, and retreated to 5 yuan and 8 corners. Hengyu and Dadecheng still came to buy, and floating shorts scrambled to cover, and rose to 8 yuan and 3 corners again. The noon closing was 857 yuan and 7 corners. After the closing, Wanxing, Hengyu and Dadecheng sold out and dropped to within 7 yuan. Finally, it was settled. It was found that the highest price in half a day was 858 yuan and 3 corners, and the lowest price was 844 yuan and 2 corners, with a total of 14 yuan and 1 corner from start to finish. As a result, it rebounded 6 yuan and 1 corner from the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was 891 yuan and 7 corners for the standard price of bid gold by the Central Bank, which was about 34 yuan lower than the closing price, more than 12 yuan less than the previous closing. The registration price for April was 856 yuan, and for May was 858 yuan.

<h3>Silver and Money Industries Gradually Make Progress, No Distinction Between Clearing and Head Markets, Auxiliary Coin Situation is Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Since the silver and money business resumed normal operations a few days ago, the situation has been progressing day by day. Various transactions have also been smoother than before. If there are no twists and turns in the middle, a steady increase can be predicted. Yesterday, the foreign interbank lending rate in the market was 7% in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day, and the addition of water to the head remained blank throughout. In terms of interbank bill transactions, more than 3.9 million were transferred in the morning market, more than 400,000 in new transactions, more than 200,000 in afternoon transactions, more than 800,000 in small general meeting transactions, more than 500,000 in foreign mortgage transactions, more than 900,000 in new transactions, more than 700,000 in various remittances, more than 1.6 million in banknote transactions were recovered, more than 1.2 million were issued, and more than 1.1 million in marked coupons, 200,000 from guest sources, and 400,000 in sales.

<h3>Securities: Public Debt Mostly in Small Lots</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange still only traded futures for one month in April. The market fluctuated very little. Only No. 43 bought a whole six, which was relatively lively. The rest were still small scattered retail trades. The forward period has not yet been listed, and most are waiting and watching, so the transaction is also clean. However, there were rumors of disorganization and suspension of auctions at nine points, but in fact, ninety-six already have a considerable history. Initially, it was to repay old debts to the bank, and its position is no different from other reorganized public debts. The Japanese gold portion is planning reorganization measures. The government, even if it is unable to reorganize at the same time, will certainly not plant those who are overthrown and overturn those who are overthrown, and transfer the order to suspend its auctions. Are the rumor mongers have other functions, it can be observed later. Yesterday's experience was high and low, with no major difference. Ninety-six fell by three corners, and recovered one corner in the afternoon. The most transactions throughout the day were by No. 43, who entered a whole six. As a result of its market convenience, most fell by one or two corners to three and a half corners. The total number of transactions was 4.27 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed in the left table for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Category Maximum Minimum Compared to Yesterday Transaction Volume</p>

<h3>American Rubber Stock Trading Especially Good</h3>
<p>The Singapore Feng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (the 26th) that the New York stock market was mixed and slightly down. Traders were generally focused on rubber and silver. The International Rubber Restriction Committee's decision to reduce production quotas was unexpected, and the rubber futures market showed signs of excessive selling, causing the market to soar by more than 100 pounds. The strength of silver prices was due to continued buying by the United States, and it was believed that the silver faction in Congress wanted to reduce the fineness of silver coins, making the price of silver equal to $1.29. However, the amendment to Thomas's work relief bill has been rejected by the committee, so hope is slim. The Belgian franc is extremely weak, and traders still believe it will be devalued, and the gold group will also collapse. The bond market fell slightly, except for U.S. government bonds, because 80% of the fourth Liberty Loan has been exchanged, so it is trending upward. There was not much fluctuation in small exchange stocks, and wheat also rose and fell unevenly, partly due to fear of foreign wheat imports, and partly because Argentina opposed maintaining the minimum price of world wheat before the end of this year's harvest. The total daily trading volume was 440,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<p>25th 26th Rise/Fall</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 99.50 98.97 Down 0.53</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 28.14 27.66 Down 0.48</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 16.26 16.14 Down 0.12</p>
<p>40 Bonds 94.64 94.44 Down 0.20</p>
<p>11 Commodities 54.90 55.31 Up 0.41</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Standard Cotton Yarn Falls in the Morning and Recovers in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, and the situation gradually showed firmness. A large number of chips were taken in by a certain bull, and temporarily closed and not released. According to the market, the yarn cloth warehouse has a total of more than 13,000 bales by the end of this month, and 80% to 90% are in the hands of the bulls, so the standard yarn situation has been reversed. This situation is more unfavorable to the seller.</p>
<p>Golden Market Situation If Stable</p>
<p>The standard cotton yarn market opened in the morning, and because foreign cotton showed a slight downturn, the selling pressure in the market was strong, and people were lazy. However, the large accounts did not move. As a result, each month fell by six, seven, or eight cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was still flat. When it was auctioned to the second and third rounds, it suddenly tended to rise, and the table suddenly became tight. Because the spot yarn sales market was lively, all parties showed excitement, and a certain bull was very calm, and the short positions were covered, and each month saw an increase. As a result, it rose by six, seven, or eight cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 1,000 bales, Yuan Yi 800 bales, Yongda 500 bales, Tongji 400 bales, Shenchang 2,000 bales, and Changfeng 500 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,250 bales, Ruida 500 bales, Changyu 450 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, Xincheng 900 bales, Shenji 550 bales, and Guda 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Account Balance</p>
<p>April 180.4 179.6 180.4 Up 0.10 44,100</p>

<p>June 179.2 178.5 179.2 ... 40,450</p>
<p>July 179.7 178.9 179.7 Up 0.30 45,450</p>
<p>August 180.1 179.5 180.1 ... 42,150</p>
<p>Total 228,650</p>
<p>Yarn Sales of More Than 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still strong. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 2,155 bales throughout the day, and the market was firm. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Tianjin 245 Guangdong 420 Wuhu 15</p>
<p>Yunnan 500 Shantou 10 Sichuan 275</p>
<p>Inland 85 Henan 225 Changsha 73</p>
<p>Weihaiwei 220 Ningbo 14 Xuzhou 13</p>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere still showed hovering, because the amount of short selling was too much. However, a certain company also kept selling, and the market pressure was still heavy. However, in the afternoon, it was heard that although the price of silver rose sharply, the closing price of the gold market was higher than the previous day, so those who made profits covered their short positions, and the market turned to rise.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Hovers and Is Firm</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, and all months fell in unison, and Dafu came to sell a huge amount, and the market sentiment was mostly that the price of silver reported a long position, the gold market fell, the US cotton fell by 5 pounds, and the Indian cotton rose and fell mutually, with about 0.25 rupees up and down, so the market was very scattered. As a result, each month fell by 1-2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, the market suddenly turned to rise, and the buying wind was particularly strong, because it was heard that the morning gold market closing price rose by 6-7 yuan compared to the previous day, floating short positions were covered, and the market became more and more concentrated. As a result, each month rose by 1.5-3 cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 6,700 dan, Zhenda 1,200 dan, Yichang 1,600 dan, Changfeng 3,000 dan, Run Kang 1,200 dan, Yongda 1,200 dan, Dayi 1,900 dan, Junchang 1,700 dan, Shengyuan 1,700 dan, and Xincheng 1,100 dan.

<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Fluctuates Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was flat, with each month rising or falling by 1-6 pounds. Then, due to the purchase of spot goods by the same industry, the foundation was firm, and the northeast climate report stated that the preparation work for cotton fields was temporarily suspended, and the market price trended upward again. In the afternoon, the bulls settled and went downstream again. At the time of closing, some short accounts were covered, slightly showing stability. As a result, spot goods fell by 5 pounds, and futures fell by 1-5 pounds. The British cotton market was firm, spot goods rose by 5 points, futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton was weak due to selling by Japanese merchants and poor Liverpool telegrams, with Pingguo Er rising by 0.25 rupees, Aomula rising by 0.75 rupees, and Ziluoxi falling by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram recording is on the left (26th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grain: Futures Flour Weak, Bran Calm</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month showed a trend of first stabilizing and then weakening. The quotation for foreign wheat was nearly 1/4 cent lower in Chicago, and 4/8 cent lower further out, and about 8 cents better in Canada. When the prices were first quoted, the foreign wheat prices were stable. The small factories had some covering, so the near-term prices did not fluctuate, but the far-term prices were slightly better by 1 cent. After the second round, because there was no increase in tax on foreign wheat, as seen in yesterday's telegram, people became tired again, and the bulls gradually returned, down by 1-2 cents compared to the opening price. When the afternoon market opened, the current month had few transactions because delivery was approaching and both sides were settling. The far-term prices remained slightly weak due to the lack of buying interest. However, the torrential spring rains are bound to damage the spring harvest, and the future rises and falls are related to the weather. As a result, the current month was down 0.5 cent, April was down 2.5 li, May and June were each down 1 cent, July was down 7.5 li, and August was down 12.5 li.</p>
<p>The bran market has been calm in recent days. Yesterday, the mainland gangs were buying smoothly, and the factories were asking for prices slightly higher by 1-2 cents, opening at 2.567 yuan. The Dongzhuang area was still stagnant, and sales were not strong. If the sales market is more active, the future prospects are slightly better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Lack Vitality</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally calm, and the foreign wheat quotations only fluctuated slightly in the near term. When the prices were first quoted, the current month had passed, and it was heard that the quantity delivered this time was about 12 cars, because a large number of goods were taken away beforehand for distribution to factories. The market sentiment for July and August was also flat, and it was difficult to determine the new wheat harvest this year. The future changes in foreign wheat were also difficult to predict, so both buyers and sellers had no divine assistance, and the market lacked vitality. As a result, July was down 2 cents, and August was down 1 cent. Spot wheat was not traded because factory demand had not moved.</p>
<p>(Overseas) The US government announced that the spring wheat planting area can be increased by 75%, and there should be no unlimited restrictions. The situation in the southwest is not good, which is the reason why prices can be maintained. The market is small and has a hovering trend.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat 25th 26th Rise/Fall</p>

<h3>River Rice High, Stable, and Slightly Weak - Domestic Sales of Foreign Rice Still Smooth -</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was scarce due to wind resistance, only a dozen ships arrived (a total of more than 2,000 shi of goods). The sales market on this street was also quiet due to the rain, so the market color showed a flat weakness again. Later, although some gangs from Haiwei, Yantai, etc. took more than 1,000 bags, the Hakka people tightened up and ate the plates firmly, which had no effect. Therefore, as a result, the prices of high-priced japonica rice and thin indica rice were stable and slightly weak in the near term, and various varieties such as Shejian and Yinyuan showed softness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the weather was cloudy and humid, and not many ships arrived from the river, only a dozen or so. The sales of various kinds in the market were flat, the price of white japonica rice was slightly higher in the morning, the price in the evening turned stable, the price of thin indica rice was a few cents lower, and the price of Jiashan early rice was slightly lower, while the prices of other goods showed a soft trend.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) The rumor of tax increase has subsided, and the Yangtze River gang only has rice in transit, and there are no new transactions, so the market seems to have a downward trend. However, the domestic sales are rebounding, and the Zhejiang road is continuing to ship goods. Various ports in Wuxi, Changzhou, and Nanjing on the Shanghai-Ningbo road are also asking for prices, and a total of 12,000 bags of Siamese rice of various sizes are sold in the market. Domestic demand for Kehsien milled and unpolished rice is also active, and 2,500 bags of unpolished red rice are sold. The market has changed from weakness to stability, and people's hearts are also firm.</p>
<p>(Soybeans) Still lacks the power to rise, mainly because people's hearts are weak and sales are flat, so the market momentum is small. Yesterday, a total of one car of Yingzhou beans was traded at a price of 3.65 yuan, two cars of Haozhou beans were traded at a price of 3.478 yuan, 260 bags of Quanhe beans were traded at a price of 3.65 yuan, 400 bags of Guide beans were traded at a price of 3.68 yuan, more than 300 bags of Dangshan beans were traded at a price of 3.65 yuan, four cars of Fanjia Tun beans were traded at a price of 4.12 yuan, more than 800 bags of Hankou Zha beans were traded at prices ranging from 3.51 yuan to 3.24 yuan, and more than 400 bags of Hankou Chi beans were traded at a price of 3.32 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Foreign Firms Cut Prices on White Tung Oil</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, the price of white tung oil has risen sharply, and foreign firms in Hankou have even raised the price to 41-42 yuan per dan. However, the price is too high and is prone to setbacks. Yesterday, a telegram was received from Hankou saying that foreign firms have cut the price of tung oil to 39 yuan. After a big rise, it is appropriate to have a small setback. Currently, foreign firms still need goods, so although it has depreciated now, there may be a possibility of rebounding.</p>
<h3>Metals: Green Lead Rises Again</h3>
<p>Recently, spot green lead has suddenly become scarce, and the demand from customers and manufacturers has gradually become active. Overseas prices are also gradually rising, so the market is very tight, and people's hearts are exceptionally good, resulting in the standard price rising again. The market price per dan has risen sharply from 13.75 yuan to 14.25 yuan. It is heard that there were 400-500 transactions, which were opened by metal shops in the French Concession. However, the amount of circulating goods in the market is very thin, so the trend is exceptionally good. Therefore, the price quotation is quite optimistic.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Old Villager)</p>
<p>People's natures are different: Mencius said that nature is good; Xunzi said that nature is evil; Gaozi, Qidiao Kai and others believed that nature is neither good nor evil. In fact, each has its own reasons, and it is difficult to be sure. I think it is better to speak of "desires" than "nature."</p>
<p>Desires are something that everyone has; nature may not be something that everyone has. The deeper you live in the world, the more diluted your nature becomes; because nature is like clean water, and desires are like red, blue, and black ink, which, when injected into the water, cannot but change its color. There is nothing to name it, so name it "social nature." —That is desire—</p>
<p>Looking at the affairs of society with a cold eye, there is no rationality. The common focus is on the word "desire"; of course, if a person's mind is filled with "desires," how can you talk about "nature"!</p>
<p>Do animals have nature? Dogs and horses are loyal, and crows know filial piety. It seems that animals also have nature. People, on the other hand, only know themselves and do not know others; they only know fame and profit and do not know loyalty and filial piety; they are busy and bustling, chasing after the smelly and attaching themselves to the stinking, and their nature has long been lost. What remains is just countless "evil desires" lying across their chests! How can they compare with animals!</p>
<h3>Happy to Crawl Through Hoops</h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>Why bother to be so astute in life? It's better to be muddled! A muddled person doesn't necessarily suffer more losses than an astute person. But look, there are also people who can't be fooled in anything, anywhere, but they still pretend to be muddled sometimes. Since there are people in the world who understand "not being foolish and deaf, you won't be a master," it can be seen that there are many精灵 ghosts disguised as muddled bugs!</p>
<p>Once, I was chatting with Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing, and we discussed this second meaning:</p>
<p>People make hoops, and I crawl through them. If they see me crawling through their hoops, they will make another one and wait for me to crawl through it again; but I may not crawl through it. If they see me not crawling through their hoops again, they will not think it strange, and will blame themselves for the hoop not being made well, or think that I (the hoop crawler) just happened to miss it: Because my willingness to crawl through their hoops is enough to gain their trust! In general, do not crawl through big hoops, and do not reveal the truth; —this is the secret of pretending to be muddled— small hoops can be crawled through, —because they are only minor matters.</p>
<p>This is truly the highest level of philosophy of life! Everyone doesn't need to be afraid when they see a hoop, but they should consider in advance whether this hoop is worth crawling through; otherwise, if you crawl into a big hoop, don't be surprised then!</p>
<h3>A Funeral Record</h3>
<p>— Flower Bell</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to participate in the funeral of a relative. The weeping of the two orphaned children was extremely sad, and the ceremony was bustling and prosperous, which was truly enviable. This old lady who recently returned to the Jade Pool, I don't know how many lives she cultivated to have such two virtuous sons.</p>
<p>But on the way to the funeral, I was in the same car with a maternal aunt who was over sixty years old. The car was pulled by an old and thin horse, and slowly advanced in the procession. Then, the maternal aunt began to talk to me about everything the deceased old lady experienced before her death.</p>
<p>She said: "Don't look at the appearance of my cousin's two sons, and think that she was blessed in her life. You don't know that her two virtuous sons treated her worse than strangers.</p>
<p>"Old people are always more economical than young people. If their clothes are old, they are unwilling to change them for new ones. Even if they are broken, they are reluctant to throw them away. Naturally, she sees her sons and daughters-in-law spending money recklessly, and can't help but tremble a few times. Therefore, her sons and daughters-in-law hate her very much, and often wish she would return to heaven sooner.</p>
<p>"Last month, she ate some sour and rotten things and had severe diarrhea. Her sons and daughters-in-law just pretended not to know. Later, she became seriously ill, and I went to visit her. She shed tears and said that her sons and daughters-in-law said she loved money as if it were her life, so they didn't ask a doctor to see her.</p>
<p>"She was sick like this for half a month, and was already lying in bed and unable to move. Only then did they ask a doctor to see her once. Then, she died. Hmph, after she breathed her last, her sons and daughters-in-law were all so filial, just the coffin alone was worth five or six hundred yuan. Look at her like that today, who doesn't praise the sons' filial piety and envy the old lady's blessings?"</p>
<p>After hearing what she said, I felt a little lost in my heart.</p>
<h3>Rescue at the Fire Ground</h3>
<p>— Made by</p>
<h3>Mr. Mingshan Donates Books and Raises Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Wang An</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Mingshan of Changzhou was a jinshi in the late Qing Dynasty. In his old age, he wrote as many works as his height, and his calligraphy and painting were widely circulated, and those who obtained them treasured them as jade. Last year, there was a terrible famine, unprecedented in a hundred years. The severity of the disaster in Jiangnan was no greater than in Liyang and Yixing. The famine victims in the two counties flocked to Changzhou, and the refugees filled the roads, which was unbearable to witness. Mr. Mingshan, as a recluse in the Jianghu, with the idea of ​​providing shelter to the people, was deeply saddened when he saw this. Therefore, he set up a bureau with his colleagues to provide relief, from winter to spring, without interruption for a day. Now, because the funds raised were insufficient, like soup poured on snow, he specially came to Shanghai to borrow books from the Wuxi fellow villagers association on Qipu Road to raise funds for disaster relief, for a period of five days. Yesterday was the first day, and the reporter visited. Mr. Mingshan's eight styles of calligraphy are based on the Northern Stele, and are vigorous and ancient, full of vitality, and cannot be confined by the Northern Stele. Therefore, those who seek墨妙 come one after another. On the way to Shanghai, Mr. Mingshan impromptu wrote four quatrains about the disaster victims, which he wrote on a screen. The words and meanings were sad and touching, no less than a picture of refugees, which shows Mr. Mingshan's thoughts. The poems are recorded below: Broken cotton and tattered reeds cover the chest, Snow-covered and frost-stricken, unable to withstand the cold, Who is like King Zhou building hundreds of walls, Why is Shenzhou not revived? Peach blossoms shine brightly after the snow, Vegetable fields also spit out yellow ying, The homing geese have no thoughts of returning, Sadly watch the inch of wheat in the spring suburbs turn green. The broken-tailed fish drifted about and almost lost its soul, Who can be commissioned to paint a picture, My compatriots are just words of peace, I want to call Hengqu to rise from the nine springs. A sick woman holds a breastfed infant, Running to the imperial pavilion at the end of the street in the morning, Refugees should not be used as poetic material, Old tears wet Guan Cheng at night.</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting and Mounting (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>The colors of silk and satin in the past were mostly pale moon white and pale ivory. Now, there are purple sauce, ink green, white bronze, printed white, rice color, etc. White is generally used. As a rule, light colors are used for old calligraphy and paintings, while deep colors are suitable for new ones. Brocade borders are not very aesthetically pleasing. There are swastika brocade, hexagonal brocade, etc. One is too dark, and the other is too vulgar. It is better to use silk and satin.</p>
<p>Fan surfaces and ruler surfaces, although some are mounted as screens, should be mounted as albums for preservation. The bottom surface should be paired with plywood. Ginkgo is the best, nanmu is too light, and redwood is too heavy. The cover of hand scrolls is mostly made of old brocade, and the endpaper can be made of cold-gilded paper or Chen Xuan paper. The ribbons at the top of couplets and screens are often in ancient bronze or yellow, which are easily discolored when exposed to moisture. It is better to use pure white for cleanliness. In terms of softness, silk is better than yarn; in terms of fit, round is not as good as flat. Rope loops are mostly made of copper strips, and some use gold and silver to show luxury. The loop holes should be small, and the loop feet should be rounded. The wrapping heads at both ends of the flat shaft are best made of old brocade, followed by swastika brocade. Paper should not be used.</p>
<p>Old mounted famous scrolls use paper edges, which have not come off to this day. Album pages are also paper-cut and paper-inlaid, which are durable. Nowadays, people compete for silk and satin, which come off in a few years. It can be said to be flashy but not practical.</p>
<p>It is best to mount calligraphy and paintings during the summer dog days, which is called "dog day mounting." The mold season is too humid, the autumn season is too dry, and the winter season is prone to glue freezing, so it is not very suitable. If the paste can be dried thoroughly by sticking it to the wall for a longer time during mounting, it is fine. The upper wall and lower wall are also related to the climate. The upper wall should be humid to keep it moist; the lower wall should be dry to make it flat.</p>
<p>It is said that the paste for mounting is made of pepper water and white flour, stirred once every morning. When using it, add a little clove powder to prevent mold and insects. Some say that the paste must be mildewed first, remove the mildewed surface, and then mix it with water for use, so that it will not mildew again in the future, but few people really do this. It is best to use Bletilla striata to fold the edges when mounting hand scrolls and album pages, even if they are paper-mounted, they will last for a long time and not come off.</p>
<p>For famous and precious calligraphy and paintings that use two layers of paper, pay attention when handing them over for mounting. Because cunning mounters often secretly remove the bottom layer to profit, and the first layer will lose its spirit. This must be guarded against!</p>
<p>When calligraphy and paintings are hung on the wall, they must be "backed." "Backing" is extremely important. Pure cotton paper should be used to make it one piece with the original core. Now some use bamboo pulp, but foreign kraft paper and oiled paper must not be used.</p>
<p>"Installing the shaft," "attaching the rod," "pasting the top," and "gluing the end" should all be paid attention to. "Installing the shaft" uses glutinous rice paste, pounded into a glue, which is better than foreign glue. "Attaching the rod" should use uniform paste, so that it can be rolled up after drying, otherwise the whole piece will easily become wavy. "Pasting the top" is best in the shape of a crucian carp's back. The length of "gluing the end" should be near the rope loop. It is not appropriate to be too long or too short.</p>
<p>People in the north often like to use three-color silk, inlaid and mounted in sections, which is very expensive, but its system is actually vulgar. The most ridiculous thing is that some even have two ribbons inlaid at the top and droop down, called "startling swallows," thinking it is exquisite. It is not known where its beauty lies. Recently, some use city green paper sprinkled with gold to replace silk and satin. It is still acceptable when first mounted, but it will change color after being weathered and will not last long.</p>
<p>Silk has patterns, while satin is plain. The patterns sometimes have flowers, sometimes imitate ancient patterns, each with its own merits. My friend Tao Jun Lengyue customizes Lengyue patterns to form a unique style, just like Wu Jun Sulan uses Impatiens balsamina to dye silk for mounting paintings.</p>
<p>Some calligraphy and paintings are not mounted as scrolls but are paired with wooden frames. Redwood, rosewood, and nanmu can all be used, but when matching the frame, they must first be backed or inlaid with silk and satin before they can be put on the frame to make them fit and look beautiful. Some frames use glass, and some do not use glass. Those without glass are easy to get old after hanging for a long time; those with glass must have close back seams to prevent leaks, otherwise moisture will penetrate and water stains will appear on the glass. In short, framed paintings are not as easy to roll and unroll, carry, and preserve as scrolls.</p>
<h3>Records of the Lingering Fragrance of the Emperor</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Therefore, I knew the general situation of the work of the palace artisans and their living conditions in more detail than anyone else. If I were to write about it carefully, the sewing industry alone could fill a thick volume. As for the silkworm breeding industry in the palace (not including silkworm raising), the information would be even richer. Even the industry that specializes in making phoenix shoes for the Empress Dowager, which is considered the smallest in scope, would not be difficult to write a separate book about.</p>
<p>Now, let me write some of it out in an extra simplified way.</p>
<p>"Come with us!" the Empress Dowager said to me one morning. "Haven't you seen the various procedures of silk making yet? It's very interesting! Today, I want to add some new knowledge to you! Just imagine how we will deal with these silks after those silkworms have sacrificed their lives and spun such magical and lovely silks! To understand this, you can't just imagine it out of thin air. You must follow us to observe it on the spot!"</p>
<p>The words the Empress Dowager said to me that day were naturally not like this. The terms used in it may not have existed at that time! This is the original meaning I remember now, and I have reconstructed it myself. However, I can say that I have not reconstructed it very similarly. The Empress Dowager's words were often extraordinarily touching, full of a magical power that made listeners feel sympathetic. This is something I can never learn. Take this small matter as an example: I originally had no special interest in the craft of silk making, but after she said that, I immediately got up happily. (279)</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11 The Night Talk of a Miserable Life Is Originally a Dream. Scattered Footprints, the Wind and Rain Are Too Deceptive.</p>
<p>Everyone has to study it. Where did this thing come from? As time goes by, bad people don't need to be led? Just follow the road. Good people also get more and more jealous, and they come with a little lead. At first, they probably didn't want to do business, just make some money to dress up. But once they are hooked, they can't get rid of it. Speaking of this, the voice lowered a bit, came over, and sat across the table from Jia Duocai very calmly: It's these tea room masters who won't spare them. If they are good-looking, they will be drawn in even more. Poor girls can't resist the temptation of money. They can make a few dollars for each visit. Why wouldn't they want to do it? Good girls go down this road just to be modern. The Anhui girl I mentioned is the most popular one running in Little Western Heaven. People gave her a name, called the Hotel Empress. Once she has the name of Empress, it's up to them. The tea room is almost looking for him every day. How can a child in his teens stand this kind of abuse? I think she seems to be sick. I talked to him, and he said it was very hard. He had been doing this low-down thing for a year and wanted to quit, but there were too many connections involved, and he couldn't quit. Jia Duocai said: If he does so much, doesn't his family know? Huanhua said: How can his family not know that he wears such a modern dress? In the past, his family may not have wanted their young lady to do such a thing. However, when the young lady goes home, she can always bring a few dollars. The family has been poor for many years, so saving the poor is important. They have to let her go. Now, I heard that his parents also have some regrets, but their opium addiction is already very big. If they don't let the young lady come out, the opium soil can't enter the door, and he puts on makeup and runs outside every day, so he always has a bad reputation. It's not easy to marry him off either. I can only take it one day at a time. (168)</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>On "Handwritten Characters"</h3>
<p>— Bashan</p>
<p>Recently, many magazines on the market have attached the first issue of "Handwritten Characters" vocabulary. Looking at those "Handwritten Characters," they seem to be similar to the simplified characters that the Ministry of Education is going to cast copper molds in Shanghai. Yesterday, the author mentioned "Handwritten Characters" when talking about the problem of misspelled characters, thinking that some of these "Handwritten Characters" are not popular, and even those of us who have already learned a lot of characters do not recognize them. It is felt that it is unreasonable to learn these other tens of characters after having already learned a lot of characters, and I dare not agree with it. Instead, I am willing to reform from the root to recognize Latinized characters. Later, after talking about this issue with friends, some friends thought that we are suffering very little in recognizing misspelled characters now, that is, it is easy for those of us who have already learned to recognize misspelled characters. In order to popularize education and eliminate illiteracy, we should suffer this bit. At the same time, some friends are very interested in promoting simplified characters. He not only supports simplified characters but also advocates promoting cursive script that is simplified again. I didn't originally oppose "Handwritten Characters." After talking with my friends, I felt that what they said made sense.</p>
<p>Researching the ancients' attitude toward characters, they were also deleting the complex and simplifying the simple. After Li Si promoted the small seal script, characters became much easier to write. By the Jin Dynasty, the cursive script came out, and the simplification of strokes reached the extreme. Unfortunately, later, they went backward and wrote the regular script of the true script. Now, the simplified characters in the first issue of the "Handwritten Characters" vocabulary are all derived from the gradual changes of the regular script of the true script. Although they are much simpler than the regular script of the true script, they are much more troublesome than the cursive script. I feel that for the sake of convenience now, it is still best to use cursive script. That is to say, since we want to reform characters to seek convenience, we might as well prohibit the true script and use the cursive script.</p>
<p>Moreover, the "Promoting Handwritten Characters Green Origin" says, "We have many convenient characters in our daily lives. Everyone writes them this way by hand, but books are not printed this way. It is inconvenient to have to recognize more than two forms of a character to recognize a character. Now, we advocate using handwritten characters in printing to save writers the trouble of memorizing several fonts, making characters easier to recognize and write, and more able to spread to the public." However, judging from the first issue of the vocabulary, many of our "scholars'" "handwritten characters" are not the same as them. Many of our "handwritten characters" are cursive scripts. For example, the characters "爲," "好," "書," "手," "可," "如," etc., our "scholars'" "handwritten characters" are cursive scripts. Not only are we "scholars" alone, but most of the literate general merchants, shop assistants, and workers are also using those few cursive script "handwritten characters." Since we are using "handwritten characters" to avoid the "inconvenience" of "having to recognize more than two forms of a character to recognize a character," then our cursive script "handwritten characters" should not be used in printing. If, according to the first issue of the vocabulary, some of our "scholars'" "handwritten characters" are cursive scripts, but they are simplified misspelled characters when used in printing, then aren't we "scholars" still as inconvenient as we are now when printing true scripts? We believe that the first issue of the vocabulary is an incomplete work.</p>
<p>Some people say that the shapes of cursive script and true script are different. It is not good to print cursive script and true script together, because the shapes are not unified, and it is difficult to print. If the gentlemen who promote "Handwritten Characters" do not use cursive script "handwritten characters," then that is their intention. Then, for the sake of unification, we advocate a thorough solution: promoting cursive script. With a sincere attitude, I contribute to the gentlemen who promote "Handwritten Characters." I wonder if they think so?</p>
<h3>Fallen</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>I never thought that I would come to hibernate in a corner of this metropolis, in a dark attic that never sees the sun, living a snail-like life as desolate as a house, as if forgotten by the world and forgetting the world.</p>
<p>I often have to save food. There is no other way but to use longer sleeping hours to resist the hunger in my stomach. Therefore, I always wake up in the afternoon. After eating something hastily, it gets dark. It's like I've gotten through another careless day.</p>
<p>The rent is in arrears to the point where I feel it's too unreasonable. Every morning, I hear the nanny knocking on the door. I pretend to be asleep and ignore it. But when it's time to go out, I can't escape that embarrassing scene.</p>
<p>As soon as the old landlady sees me, she shouts, putting on a very ugly face:</p>
<p>——Sir, please pay the rent as soon as possible. It's been over a month.</p>
<p>——I'll pay you in a few days. Don't worry.</p>
<p>Every time, I have to vaguely mumble and get through it. A few days go by, and then a few more days. I don't know how many days I've endured. During this period, the landlady urges me more and more urgently, and her face becomes even more iron-green. The gentle expression of the past no longer appears on her wrinkled face.</p>
<p>Finally, she unceremoniously issued an eviction order:</p>
<p>——Hey, if you don't have money to pay the rent, you can move out. I'd rather sacrifice the past rent so we can rent it out to someone else.</p>
<p>I don't know how many times this sentence has been said. I'm almost afraid of hearing it myself. But do you want me to live on the side of the road? I can only rely on my thick skin to live on. And endure the contemptuous eyes and sharp, invisible and visible ridicule of the landlady's family. At this time, it is not necessary for me to care about these obvious sarcasm, or even insults.</p>
<p>I slipped out, relieved. I staggered on the road. I looked at the ground with my head down, and rarely raised my head to glance at the cold faces of the strangers who passed by me. Because people see me with a head of long hair that hasn't been shaved for a few months, and a body of dirty clothes, they will surely suspect that I am a bad person, and they will preventively sweep fierce eyes and keep watching me.</p>
<p>I have used great courage to push the mill for all kinds of suffering caused by unemployment, and I am not discouraged. Because I understand that there may be more than just myself who are in the same difficult situation or suffering greater oppression.</p>
<p>What makes me feel somewhat resentful and sad is the cold emotion between people. In the beginning, some friends would often come to my house to visit me, but later they gradually became estranged, estranged to the point of complete isolation. At this moment, it has been a long time since I have seen anyone come again. Sometimes I meet that friend on the road. I can clearly see that the other party has seen me, but he immediately shifts his gaze or turns the road and walks away as if he has met a ghost. Why are you so afraid of me? Is it that getting close to someone like me will humiliate your status, or are you afraid that bad luck will spread to you?</p>
<p>I have no other feelings. I only deeply realize the thick layer of friendship that lies in front of me.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the landlady's persecution, I often go home quietly after nightfall. In the middle of the time when I haven't returned yet and have nowhere to go, some remote streets have become my only place to spend time. In the silent, desolate winter night, I wear a thin, tattered cotton robe and walk quickly. Although the cold wind is constantly blowing like a knife, because I walk fast, I don't feel cold, but instead, I feel a little warmth from my body. I hear the wind blowing against the tall sycamore trees on both sides, and occasionally one or two leaves fall from my head, and I can't help but feel sad about the desolation of my life. At this time, the surroundings are silent. Only my light footsteps are mixed with the mournful rustling of the leaves, filling the heart of the wave-rider who wants to shake. There is also a hazy moonlight in the sky, reflecting my shadow. I will carry the mixture of sadness and continue to walk all the way.</p>
<h3>Scarecrow</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhizhong</p>
<p>The newly picked pine branches burned cracklingly in the stove, emitting a light to ward off the cold, shining on the grandfather's silver whiskers.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>On the face of Gongla: Stagnant, and kind, grandfather was only smoking a dry cigarette, and his two cheeks were bulging, trying to get enough strength, as if he had forgotten the responsibility of telling stories at this time every night, as if he hadn't seen the way his grandchildren sitting on both sides were drooling in anticipation.</p>
<p>"Grandpa! Why haven't you started telling stories yet?" A pockmarked head, about ten years old, couldn't bear to wait any longer and was the first to ask.</p>
<p>"I haven't eaten yet, and I'm still telling stories! Such a big child is really like a confused bug,"</p>
<p>Grandpa glanced at the pockmarked head and still puffed his cigarette, the pine branch fire flickered, just like the expectant eyes of the grandchildren. Jianzi, who was sitting opposite, came out to intercede: "What do the children risk? You just tell a little!"</p>
<p>The youngest one saw that his father was also supporting him, so he ran to Grandpa in a puff of smoke, twisted his hand and asked him to tell a story, his face all on his sleeves, and when Grandpa turned his eyes, his sleeves were covered with glowing snot.</p>
<p>"Go sit down, go sit down, I'll tell it!" Grandpa waved his hand. He went back to his seat.</p>
<p>"There are two families living opposite each other." Grandpa coughed. "Let's assume that they are the Zhang and Li families. These two families have been feuding for generations and want to find ways to retaliate. One year, after eating New Year's Eve dinner, the Zhang family tied up a scarecrow, making it look like a blue-faced, fanged, evil ghost, holding a wooden stick in his right hand and a bamboo fan in his left hand, ah cha, ah cha,..." Grandpa coughed a few times, so anxious that the grandchildren felt that phlegm would cause trouble. The otter skin then shouted:</p>
<p>"Dad; pour the tea! Pour the tea!"</p>
<p>Grandpa took a sip of tea and stopped coughing. The grandchildren urged again: "Um, um, blue-faced fangs, holding a bamboo fan, um, um, what happened later?"</p>
<p>"His son asked him who this was, and he said:</p>
<p>"This is the plague, what he is holding in his hand is the obituary stick, this is to kill people, this bamboo fan is to sweep away wealth, and when this plague is sent to the Li family, the Li family will die and lose money."</p>
<p>His son asked him when to send it, and he said:</p>
<p>"Send it when you open the money gate." And he told Jianzi: "When you send the plague to the door of the Li family, you have to say: The money gate is wide open, the plague rolls in; good boy, someone dies and loses money!"</p>
<p>The son remembered it firmly and did the same. Later, when the Li family opened the money gate, the scarecrow rolled on the ground in front of the door, and the Li family's son quickly shouted what it was. The adults of the Li family happily and calmly said:</p>
<p>"This is the God of Wealth: this stick is a gold stick, and this bamboo fan is to drive away evil."</p>
<p>After the Li family worshipped and knelt, they sent the scarecrow back to the Zhang family. The Zhang family deliberately delayed the opening of the money gate. This was terrible. As soon as the money gate opened, the scarecrow rolled to his door again, and his son loudly recited that set of words: "The money gate is wide open, the plague rolls in; good boy, someone dies and loses money"!</p>
<p>His father was so anxious that he stomped his feet while covering Jianzi's mouth...</p>
<p>Everyone by the stove burst into laughter, the grandchildren laughed so much that saliva and tears were flowing, worshipping the sky and the earth: grandpa also laughed until he coughed into a ball. After a while, the youngest grandson twisted the snot hanging on his lips with his tongue and asked grandpa;</p>
<p>"Did the Li family make a fortune later? Did the dead lose money or the Zhang family?"</p>
<p>Grandpa seemed to feel uncomfortable and threw the dry cigarette bag against the wall: "The past is not very clear, but if you make a fortune in this day and age, you make a coffin! As for the dead losing money, that is a common occurrence!… Go ask your mother: Is there any leftover medicine soup that hasn’t been finished?… I’m very hungry!"</p>

<p>Self-Professional Introduction</p>

<h3>If You Were Born Shy, Look at Karen Morley's Example</h3>
<p>— Fei Fei</p>
<p>Why do movie stars not use their real names given by their parents, but use fake names of their own choosing? Is it because their original names were too long, not resounding enough, not easy to remember, and not flavorful enough for a performer? But that's not entirely the case. For example, if there is a name that is not too long, is very smooth, has enough Weimar Republic flavor, and is easy to remember, but he or she still definitely changes the name, what is the reason?</p>
<p>Let's take Karen Morley as an example. Her original name was Mildred Linton. That name was both short and loud, and had enough flavor of a performer, and was easy for people to recognize, but she definitely wanted to change it to her current name. What's the reason?</p>
<p>Originally, changing the name, in addition to being short, loud, smooth, flavorful, and easy to remember, there are two other big reasons. First, she wanted the name to imply a kind of exotic and chic flavor. So she found this chic name "Karen" in a novel she liked to read. "Morley" is a pseudonym of a famous writer, whom she also admired, so she prepared it too. But that's not the real reason. The more important and real reason is that she wants to wear a mask. Because she herself was very timid, after using a fake name, it was like wearing a mask, not afraid of being recognized by others.</p>
<p>All performers, if they don't put on makeup and don't add a thick layer of paint to their faces, they won't perform. However if they add a thick layer of paint to their faces, they will become bold and perform as they wish. Anyone with some stage experience knows this. Why? It is because that thick layer of paint covers their shame. In general, the reason why stage performers or movie actors use fake names is mostly for this reason. They use fake names because they are afraid that their relatives and friends will recognize them. Once they have experience and become famous, their fake names will also be spread, and their real names will be hidden.</p>
<p>The reason why writers use pen names is also the same. When they first write articles, they don't have confidence and are afraid that they won't write well and be known by people they know, so they use fake names. As time goes on, their pen names will be spread, and their real names will be hidden.</p>
<p>Karen Morley is also like this. She is naturally the most shy person. She is afraid of going to the film company to register, afraid of asking for things to do, and afraid of being ridiculed. But after using a fake name, she thought that people didn't recognize her and became bolder. She is now playing villain roles on the screen, such as robber wives, female thieves, bad women, promiscuous women, etc. When she comes to act in front of the camera, she can do all kinds of sinister woman styles, but when the camera turns elsewhere and the lights go out, she immediately returns to her original state and is so shy that she dare not raise her head when she sees people. Because she is a person who is very afraid of being timid and shy.</p>
<p>Karen Morley was born timid and shy. When she was in school, she didn't dare to go out to make friends. After she came out of school, she stayed at home to read books. Although she had the fantasy of being an actor since she was a child, and had also joined the school's drama club, she only knew how to move the scenery and never dared to perform on stage, because she was shy. When she entered university, she gave up the fantasy of being an actor and wanted to study medicine.</p>
<p>But she later thought of a way to hide her real name. Sure enough, since Mildred Linton became Karen Morley, she covered up her shyness and dared to do anything. Isn't this a strange thing? But it's not strange. If you are born timid and shy, you can try Karen Morley's method and see if it works.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Below the Sea"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ren</p>
<p>Below The Sea — Great Light Cinema</p>
<p>Old concepts entangled in the old creative methods of drama, made him create a story of good and evil here. During the war, the captain of a German submarine killed the first mate to profit from salvaging three million sunken gold at the bottom of the sea, which greatly hurt his virtue, so fifteen years later, although he used various deceptive methods to salvage the sunken gold, he ended up buried in the belly of a fish, and the sunken gold also fell back to the bottom of the sea. On the other hand, the sailor Maggie, although also greedy for profit and tried to get half of this sunken gold, he bravely saved the lives of others, so although he did not get that ill-gotten wealth, he finally got the love of a rich girl, and then lived a happy life.</p>
<p>Such a story is naturally difficult to arouse people's interest. Although punishing evil and promoting good is not the playwright's intention, people will not be satisfied in a non-realistic story that is close to a fairy tale. The sunken gold has been salvaged from the water, and the bottom of the box just happens to break at this time, how coincidental!</p>
<p>Perhaps people will feel frightened by the scene of the storm and waves in the sea. Perhaps people will feel relaxed by the flirtations between the rich lady and Maggie. But the result is only individual existence, and these cannot make the whole play achieve a tense and exciting effect. And that kind of flirtation is even more forced and annoying, we are really tired of seeing this kind of stiff love entanglement in American movies.</p>
<p>Indeed, what is more commendable is the scene of the storm in the sea, which is indeed very difficult to film. But this does not mean that the photography has excellent results. If the entire photography is reviewed, it is only mediocre. As for the colorful part of the turban, we can regard it as museum teaching material, but inserting it into this play inevitably shows traces of stiffness. As for the various things at the bottom of the sea, in addition to seeing the diving machine go up and down, or the posture of the octopus, there is nothing more amazing.</p>
<p>What is more commendable is that the protagonist Schmode (Captain of Drekking) has not been portrayed as a person who has lost his humanity, that is to say, he does not show an unforgivable villain on his face. Fredrik Vogeding takes on this role, he gives us real pity, this may not be a more technical place. There is nothing else particularly commendable.</p>
<h3>Little Chaney Appeared!</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>After three years of fierce competition, the new Chaney finally appeared on the screen!</p>
<p>Chaney — This immortal famous actor on the silver screen, who can inherit his artistic position? It turns out that this new Chaney is his son Creighton Chaney.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Creighton decided to appear on the screen with his own name, but the producers insisted that he use his father's name, but he refused, frankly stating that he was not qualified to inherit his father's fame.</p>
<p>Five or six companies were willing to sign a contract with him, as long as he was willing to use his father's name. Later, he finally succumbed and agreed to them. However, the word "Little" must be placed above "Chaney".</p>
<p>"I finally gave in," Creighton told reporters, "for the sake of life, for the sake of my wife and two children's lives."</p>
<p>"For three years, I have fought for my doctrine, that is, I want to appear on the screen with my own strength without relying on my father's fame, but in the end I failed, and for the sake of life, I am no longer allowed to insist on my claims.</p>
<p>"Now that I have changed my name, success is naturally very sure. I have already signed a three-year long-term contract with a company, filming eight films every year.</p>
<p>"That is to say, in these three years, I can get a lot of valuable experience. After these three years, I want to try the kind of roles that my father did. I don't want to, and can't, replace his position. Indeed, this is something that no one can do, but I always want to do my best."</p>
<h3>Hu Die in Moscow</h3>
<p>Ms. Hu Die, among the film actors in China, can probably be said to be the most noticed. Naturally, she has top artistic talent, and more importantly, she is humble and willing to work hard. This time, she and Mr. Zhou Junjianyun were invited by the Soviet International Film Exhibition to go to Moscow to visit the current state of the art world in this emerging country. After they arrived in Soviet Russia, the Soviet government gazette and Izvestia commented on the significance of the arrival of Chinese film star Ms. Hu Die in the Soviet Union, praising her highly, calling her a famous star with amazing talent. They also said: "Ms. Hu's arrival here is to study Soviet films, as well as the work of Soviet directors and actors. She will stay here for two weeks and then go to Leningrad to study," etc.</p>

<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Hate of India's Downfall (Clive of India) (12)</h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>As he was gazing at that vast river, he suddenly remembered a letter in his pocket. He quickly took it out, opened it and read it. It was written on it; "Robert, they all say you are adventurous - that is dangerous to all of us... But, Robert, no matter what they say, just keep doing it. As long as you believe it, I am invincible. I only pray for your victory." Clive finished reading, took a deep breath. He suddenly straightened his waist and scolded himself: "Cowardly coward, your courage is not as good as that of a woman!"</p>
<p>At this moment, a strong wind blew outside the tent, and suddenly the sky became dark. Edmund shouted wildly, "Robert, the trade winds are coming! The tide is coming! The rain is coming!" Clive responded mechanically, "The rain is coming." His high hopes were unconsciously lowered again. Now it is impossible to communicate with Mir Jafar first. He looked at the pair of letters in his hand again and said to himself: "She has already told me to do what I believe in!" He suddenly jumped up and shouted, "Whirlsh! Captain! Take down the tents, blow the horns to line up - Li An, take the cannons out! Lightly armed and fast, without luggage! Gather at the riverside! Cross the river immediately, cross the river immediately!"</p>
<p>A page of history was once again folded into a brave man. In the battle of Plassey, Sarrautdola was defeated. The revenge of Calcutta was also avenged. Clive put the traitor Mir Jafar on the throne of India. The British established this puppet, and the arrogance of the merchants suddenly rose into the clouds. The position of the French in India also fell into decline because of this. Mir Jafar, out of gratitude, offered the royal treasures and jade to Clive's banner as much as possible, and Clive, in order to please his wife, accepted them generously. In this way, the two of them tied up again and returned to their hometown of England.</p>
<p>Clive's return to England was already rich and noble. He has been promoted to Baron of Plassey and called Lord Clive. He built a baronial mansion in Walcott that was as rich as a prince. Around the mansion, he purchased hundreds of acres of endless grassland, planted with many flowers, plants and trees. The couple then wandered under the forest, forgetting the dangers of war and the cruelty of slaughter, and unexpectedly enjoyed the pleasures of the countryside. They also had two more children, compensating for the pain of losing their light a few years ago. But Margaret could never forget the sacrifices made for India in her life. She never wanted to mention the word India again.</p>
<p>But human affairs are unpredictable. Clive and others were living and working in peace, surrounded by their wives and children, but in a corner of the southern sky, dark clouds rose again. After many years, Mir Jafar was overthrown by a new Indian king, and that new king! But he was more cruel than the previous Sarrautra Dola, and he was very hostile to the British. Therefore, the position of the British in India was shaken again, and the Governor of India, Bigot, thought of Clive again and wanted to invite him to make a comeback.</p>
<p>But Clive at this time, after being rich and noble, no longer had the sharpness he had when he was in exile. He also occupied a seat in Parliament. He has been successful for a long time, living a happy life at home. How can he mention the word "India" to Margaret again? But Governor Bigot persuaded him with sincere words, telling him that now most people lack courage, are afraid of things, procrastinate and delay, and miss the opportunity, so that the career he created will be lost by others. Clive was praised and encouraged by Bigot, and he unconsciously became happy to see the hunt, and his old skills recovered. But Margaret was still pregnant with a piece of his flesh, how could he open his mouth to her? (To be continued)</p>
