<p>— 年</p>
<p>學生運動之復興本報得第一决北平學生游行請願消息後已於十一日著評有所論列矣當時持論以爲北平學生感深切肌膚之痛起而請願一吐心聲感覺同氣其舉動宜受深諒且學生運動足以宣導鬱結激發民氣亦可爲外交家周旋折衝之後盾宜受相當之尊重然茲所言猶爲彼時事態所局僅對執政及社會促其了解耳旬日以來飛勢發展一方而愛國運動全國響應賴中央及各地當局態度之賢明學生請願均獲滿意之結果另一方而則以北平警憲之武力阻止致北平學生有再激再勵之請願深可惋惜之消息繼續接觸於吾人之手眼北方輿論且感覺其嚴重而表示焦慮記者今日除要求北平負責當局改絃易轍有以滿足學生純正之願望勿使久成僵持以消除可焦慮之事態外更就愛國運動之本體一闡言之</p>
<p>第一北平學生首决請願之要求七項（見十四日本報北平通訊）實爲此决愛國運動之主旨各地繼起莫能外此而七項要求更綜括之則爲反對領土破裂與要求自由二點關於要求自由者就最近事實言除北平之特例外似已頗見成績循此以求各種自由之獲得保障並非無望關於領土者則中央行政新當局之態度已灼然共見北平負責諸人何應欽旣謂「此間各當局均富有國家思想人事之變史並不影響國家之統一」宋哲元亦有「一切措施悉以整個國家利益爲基準」之語旣已獲言語上之保證此後要着重在監視彼等能吾實踐所言而此項監視似宜取嚴肅之姿勢未必能以興奮熱烈之態度收其效力此記者於最近學生愛國運動所具之一種理解也</p>
<p>第二學牛運　之效力其重要者爲輿論之官洩在國運日蹙全國黯然之際靑年學生能不顧利害奮然以起其價値其效力以古今中外之往事爲例俱有足述近日京粵津杭及其他各地執政者多能以破格良好之態度對付學生社會團體亦繼起爲同情之響應此卽最近學生愛國運動之一種輿論的價値與效力之顯露在此悄形下執政警惕漢奸寒心成績旣著宜復常態日來「讀書救國」「恢復課業」之論漸起非欲對學生運動加以阻遏實以學生救國方術尚另有所在未可以請國一端妨碍其他此記者希望全國數十萬靑年學生予以諒解者也</p>
<p>第三近日北平學生之冉起及各地之響應似置軍於對付北平常局及援助被捕同學按冀察政務委員會之宋哲元諸人心或無他其足惋惜者爲意氣用事視學生如讐敵在此决環境中雙方相持定無好果較善之解决方法爲暫取靜視庶中央號令如翁秘書長對學生所允許者得有試騐之機會而北平諸學校當局亦得從容以從事要求釋放學生之工作記者以爲愛國之心人所同具宋等倘改絃易轍則與參與愛國運動之學生可同立於救護國家之地位一致努力以求達愛國運動之目的此又記者所願與學牛諸君交換之意見也</p>

<p>對徐琦仲</p>
<p>提起公訴、原被兩造、均延律師到庭、肌據捕房律師張大蔭起而陳述案情、謂十月十六日、有被害人王秉中、投捕房報吿、謂被吿徐琦仲、於本年五月二十二號、向彼借去洋四萬元、在福煦路四二四弄福明邨廿八號事務所中簽立借據一紙、當時除原被吿外、尙有保人沈壽衡及律師沈軼千·沈伯雄·兩人</p>
<p>在塲簽字</p>
<p>而被吿則以執業田單三紙、（二紙在虹橋路·一紙在楊樹浦·）作為抵押品、言明押期一年六月、按月以一分半起息、當時王以此種抵押品、尙不足够、故被吿曾允將來另以南市水電公司股票十萬元交給、遂由王秉中出立上海銀行支票八張、每張計洋五千元、五月二十二日期、據王稱、該欵已經被吿向</p>
<p>銀行具領</p>
<p>後因王對於徐所交之田單、忽起懷疑、乃向土地局調查、據局長金里仁批示、謂三紙田單、均屬偽造、王乃向保人沈壽衡追查、一面委陳　律師函致被吿、限期設法將欵歸還、因無答覆、王即縣賞登報緝學、日前被杭州公安局查悉、乃限定被吿住址、通知捕房、於</p>

<p>據其覆函</p>
<p>稱、因父親不肯交出、故無辦法、我乃對於前交之田單、略起懷疑、遂送交土地局調查、據稱實係僞造、後被吿忽失踪跡、我乃登報通緝云云、劉推事當詰以發票時、爾在上海銀行有存欵多少、及該項支票之欵何時取去、王不肯答、且供述時態度倔强、致與捕房律師峪起爭執、嗣經劉推事諭令王此為</p>

<p>其時祇有王沈及我三人、當當時王等以某種手段、將預先寫好之借據、囑我照書簽字、始將上海銀行一千七百餘元之支票一紙交我、由我親往領欵、故截至立據時止、祇陸續共計收到借欵三千二百二十元、並無四萬元之事、我當時因處於威迫之下、祇得</p>
<p>簽四萬元</p>
<p>之借據、所有律師一人、係事後於另一室中走出、復在據上加押、原吿呈出上海銀行之支票八紙、我不知悉、所有田單三紙、亦係王自己之物、囑我承認為我所有、迨扞字後、我與沈壽衡同車出外、當時我以王此種手段、形同綁票式、故意欲訴諸捕房、沈聞語、即施恐嚇、致不敢報捕、尙有王呈出我之覆信、亦係王於簽據時所寫、信中</p>

<p>（七）生產力</p>
<p>據查上海，中國，啟新三廠生產能力，每年可產水泥三百十叫萬桶，計上海六十四萬桶，中國九十萬桶，啟新一百六十萬桶。但就以上三廠每年產量觀之，恒在其生產能力之下。茲將各廠最近三年產量列表如左：（每桶合一百七十公斤）</p>
<p>至於本年十個月來之產量，上海每月平均的五六百萬公斤，中國每月平均的八九百萬公斤，啟新每月平均的一千四五百萬公斤；較之去年，均見减縮。（未完）</p>
<p>（八）銷路</p>
<p>上海水泥公司銷路區域，以本埠爲大宗，的佔總銷數百分之七十，他如江浙皖等大商埠的佔百分之三十。中國水泥公司出品，大都行銷於上海，南京，安徽，江西，江蘇，浙江諸大商埠。啟新洋灰公司因全國各大商埠均沒有分行或經銷處，故其銷售範圍較廣，幾遍及全國。據查該公司上海總批發處每年銷售於江蘇，福建一帶者，的七十萬桶左右，而以本埠爲大宗；天津總事務處每年在河北，河南，山東，山西一帶銷售數量的有五十萬桶；漢口總批發處每年銷售於安徽，江西，湖南，湖北方面者，的二十萬桶；奉天總批發處銷於東三省一帶者，年的二十萬桶，但自九一八事變後，東北市塲被奪，而華北方面亦受日貨傾銷影響，銷路漸呈呆滯之象。</p>
<p>至言本年銷售數量，上半年尙稱不惡，下半年起，因市面益呈蕭條，銷路日蹙，故銷量逐月减退。據查上海水泥公司上半年每月平均的銷六百萬公斤，最近三月來每月平均恐不及五百萬公斤。中國水泥公司，上半年每月銷量平均的一千萬公斤，下半年起，每月平均銷量僅的八九百萬公斤。</p>
<p>（九）營業概况</p>
<p>華商各廠營業情形，以民國二十一年最旺，蓋其時本埠建築事業蓬勃，市價堅昂，每桶僅征統稅六角。自二十一年底起，每桶改徵統稅一元二角，成本增高，同時外貨輸入激增，且貶價傾銷，國產水泥銷路頓受阻滯，營業日就式微。迨二十三年七月，政府增高進口稅率（計每百公斤水泥進口稅增至八角三分關金），外貨輸入突减，國產水泥需要漸殷，時呈供不敷求之象，各廠營業轉好。本年最近數月表，因市而蕭條益甚，各廠營業。又趨下游。</p>
<p>水泥賣出，市價劃一。以上三廠，且聯合組織國產水泥營業所於上海四川路三十三號，專司水泥交易事務，並議定市價，各廠皆派職員常川駐所，以便顧客接洽，凡本埠躉批成交，均向營業所或廠中直接訂購，貨欵當時結淸或分大小月底繳付。至零星購買，則向五金號接洽如欲在外埠設立經理處，可與廠方簽訂合同，惟須有殷實商號之舖保，或繳若干保證金。經理處向公司辦貨，以不超過所繳之保證金爲原則，貨欵按月結淸，所有關稅運費，概歸經理處自理；公司除給予特別折扣外，並酬以相常佣金。</p>
<p>（十）最近市價</p>
<p>邇來因市態冷落，建築停頓，各廠出品，形成供過於求之勢，市價頻趨下跌。查上海出品之象牌，本年二月間每桶售價尙在七元左右（連統稅在內）。迨最近竟慘跌元餘，現僅售五元七八角之間。</p>
<p>中國之泰山牌，售價與上海相仿，亦一律下跌。</p>
<p>至於啟新之馬牌，目前每桶連統稅在內，售六元六角左右，每袋約售　元餘，均較前降低。</p>
<p>問最近各公司鑒於幣制改革後。原料漲價。且外貨來源中斷，故自本月起。每桶水泥漲價一元三角云。（完）</p>

<p>我國人計算年齡、除湖南人外、嬰兒出生、即爲一歲、經過一新年、即增一歲、故除夕出生之嬰兒、越一日至翌年元旦、即爲兩歲、此種年齡計算法、與其實足年齡相較、相差有一歲至二歲之多者、普通以爲此種錯誤、無關緊要、然在醫學衛生人類社會敎育心理等科學上、必須根據實足年齡計算與硏究時、關係至鉅、故近年我國之從事各種科學硏究者、多由虛歲推算實足年齡、所用各種方法、就所知者、有下列數種、</p>
<p>（一）許氏實足年齡之滑尺與推算表</p>
<p>北平協和醫學院敎授許文生氏於一九二三年在中國醫學雜誌上發表用滑尺推算實足年齡之方法、此尺分ABC三列、A表示新歷年月、B表示舊曆年月、新舊曆恒相差一月、C表示距離年月、又上附一滑標、可左右移動、用以對準所欲檢查之年月、應用時將滑標對準A列、是列爲測量年月、對準B列、是列爲兒童之生時年月、然後在C列上求出AB兩列對準點之距離、由此距離推算該兒童之實足年齡，越四年、許氏又與潘氏根據前法製成實足年齡計算表、在同雜誌發表、表中列明　虛歲應减之年月數、推算時祗須查明舊曆出月之橫行與新曆推算月份之直行交處所記年月、由虛歲內减去之、即得實足年齡、</p>
<p>（二）敎育部頒佈實足年齡計算表</p>
<p>敎育部於民國十九年叫月十日所頒發之實足年齡推算法、原則上與前表相同、惟减法與加法並用、推算時祗須在虛歲上先除去應减之歲數、再加應加之月數、即得實足年齡、此外如言心哲氏所發表之實足年齡計算法與商務印書館所印之實足年齡換算表、與敎育部所頒發者完全相同、以上諾法、雖較用虛數歲計算實足年齡爲稍勝、然仍不甚準確、因推算時統以月爲單位、易言之、某二人之生日與測騐日期、若一在月初計算一在月杪計算、在此等表上初無區別、但實際上相有相差至一月者、表內不列明閏年與閏月、新曆閏年不計算、相差僅一日、舊曆閏月不計算、則相差有二十九日或三十日之多、此種錯誤、似難忽略、且各表同時絕對不能用以推算新舊曆之對照日期與干支曜日等、</p>
<p>（三）洪陳兩氏中西曆對照表</p>
<p>洪氏於一九一〇年出版中西曆日期之對照一書、計五白六十九頁、自西曆八百四十一年起至　千零二十年止、共計一千一百七十九年、表中列明舊曆年月之首日與新曆對照日期、並附列每月及每日首日之干支、求任何日期之對照時、必由每日首日依决推算、陳氏中西回　日曆於一九二六年出版、共分五大冊、自西曆紀元（漢平帝元始元年）至一千九百四十年、（民國二十九年）用機械方法两中西回三曆逐日推算製成、末卷並附有干支曜日等表、以上二氏所製之表、均以日爲單位、並包括閏年閏月、至爲正確、惟因卷軼繁多、檢查時頗費時間、且由此推算兩個不同時期之距離、極感困難、書價較昂、允非一般人听能購用、</p>
<p>（四）實足年齡計算盤</p>
<p>最近由中央硏究院吳定良博士創製、應用時但須知某人虛歲若干、舊歷出生月日、頃刻之間即可求出、一、某人國歷與舊歷之生年、二、某人出生之國歷月日、三、某人出生之年月日之三項干支、四、某人出生時之曜日、五、某人出生日期與測騐日期之距離、即某人之實足年齡、以上所求方法、不特可以應用於近人、即歷史人物之年表與歷史上事實的年月日新舊歷之換算、均可由此求出、其優點至少有下列數種、　計算準確、此盤統以日爲單位、國歷之閏年與舊歷之閏月、統計算在內、毫厘不差、　時間經濟、求出上述五項答案、至多不過四十秒鐘、較之由洪陣兩氏書中專求新舊歷對照日期、尤爲敏捷、　運用靈便、此盤係用木質製成、分外中內三輪、每輪均刻有各種度數、外內　輪爲固定的、用時祇須栘動中輪、各項答案、即可依次求出、狀似羅盤、直徑的六英吋厚八分、故携帶經便、詳細用法、另備說明書、預料該盤發明後、對於敎學各界、必有所裨益也、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>蜀夫人到了樓梯下稍一停脚，在驚魂甫定和長塗跋涉以後，看去甚為困憊。</p>
<p>「可憐的蜀舅母太疲乏了，她自已也需要有人扶上樓呢，」溫和的拂朗說道，同時他以臂去圍着她。</p>
<p>「我們來做個大圍靠椅罷，」韜摩又提議道。</p>
<p>「不謝謝你們，我的童子們；不過只要有人借個肩膀給我靠靠就得了，」蜀夫人回答。</p>
<p>「我！我！」五六個人都爭獻上來，因爲那個慘　無色的慈母般的臉上，自有可以感動那些圓背心下的赤心的。</p>
<p>蜀夫人見到他們旣當這件事爲一種榮譽，她就將這個榮譽給與最値得的一個，所以別人　也沒有一點怨聲，當她靠她的臂在唐恩的闊肩膀上，臉上感激的表情使得他頰泛潮紅欣欣得意，同時她幷且說道：</p>
<p>「他把孩子們找到的；所以我想他須扶我上去。」</p>
<p>唐恩覺得因　從那晚的工作他已得到了豐滿的報酬，他不但　選捧了燈送蜀夫人上樓，幷且常他送她到了她門口正要離去的時候，她又至誠地說道，「明天會，我的孩子！願上帝賜福給你！」</p>
<p>「我願我眞是你的孩子了！」　恩說道，他覺得好像艱難與磨折使得他更加和她相接近了。</p>
<p>「你就算是我的大兒了罷，」她說着隨以一　手固結了那深深的情感。</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>沒有厮殺，沒有爭鬥，人們的心却像天氣一樣地變得陰暗起來了，是從哪一陣風中吹來的沒有血的腥味呢？</p>
<p>陰暗不僅僅包圍在人心裏，也籠罩了大地，人捲在夢中，不曉得過的是什麽日子。無比的混沌遮在眼前，咽喉裏像什麽塞住了似的窒息着，脚下是觸了礁的海船，在顚簸，在浮沉，最有把握的是眼前這一片凶暴的狂濤會結束了你的呌喊。在這一瞬眼間，蒙上心頭的情緒是憤怒——憤怒蓋住了恐懼呢——睜大了眸子望望遠處，開殆怨恨無援了。</p>
<p>「鐵烏呀，一個兩個三個……」</p>

<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>又是冷鬱的冬天了。</p>
<p>然而還沒有雪。幾日來，太陽底影子全被　層陰晦晦的色調，推向黑暗的大之傑壑裏。我底屋子流滿着暗光，冷了。這樣，寂寞交給我一些悽切的悠悠的情感，我是慣會把腦袋探到窗外，用着深思的表情，瞪着兩隻發亮的眼睛，惘惘的，對那撒滿在古幽的天空下的。一片　片的輕薄的浮雲凝神着。</p>
<p>要下雪了吧？</p>
<p>深深地吸了一口氣。我有着一串默然無語的喊呌。我底心境患着冬的季候病。我底思想煩擾着雪的夢。</p>
<p>我索然地把腦袋縮回來，窗戶隨手關上了。我在屋子裏踱着步。</p>
<p>憶想起——</p>
<p>是在好久好久以前了，我曾悲哀的寫過這樣的一篇小品：</p>
<p>下雪的犬，想到了家。</p>
<p>波浪似的心，沒法安排。憂鬱的眼睛，啾着窗外的雪花，一片一片的往下飛。</p>
<p>生命，像飛下地來的雪花。</p>
<p>流浪的夢，迷了的靑春的路孤獨的跋踄在這暗的人生道上</p>
<p>又是二年多沒回家了。</p>
<p>這已到深冬的時分，身子悽悽的冷，心也悽悽的冷！就是想：家鄕的雪，該是一大片一大片的下着，把大地全蓋得潔白的了。</p>
<p>我愛家鄕的雪，家鄕的雪藏有我幼年的春。</p>
<p>然而，家鄉的雪，如今渲染了殷紅的血！該不要輕輕地忘記那個失去了的自由的家呵！</p>
<p>不能不說是一回傷心的事吧，自從九一八那大起，家是破了，家裏的人是流亡了，於是我慢慢地把家忘却了！便帶書生命的力開始踏着堅步，走向流浪的路程上去。</p>
<p>心是熱烈的，又在憧憬於未來的光明。</p>
<p>有時，心在微笑而可嚀着私語：快跟着歷史的輪子轉，轉到新的階段上去。</p>
<p>於是，我在新生了。</p>
<p>我沒有家。我到處流浪。我認定一個方向。</p>
<p>孤獨的嘗到了不少的人生的苦　；這人生的旅途，又是多麽長而速呢！</p>
<p>常常受到一點小小的刺激，就怠慢了目已的前進力，這是我的絕大的缺點。然而，我可時時刻刻的記着人是要往前走纔能够生活呵。</p>
<p>自己已經鍜　成一個過慣異鄉生活的人了。可是同時也變成一個憂鬱的人了；春天我沒有笑，夏天我沒有笑，秋天我沒有笑，冬天我便瞅着窗外的雪花增上一片愁緒！</p>
<p>現在，我所客居的××冬深了，我的心也沉重的病了！我不禁對着這初雪唱了一回輓歌</p>
<p>於是，想到了家。</p>
<p>東北的深冬呵，該是多麼美麗的雪的世界！</p>
<p>還能够嚷我舒展開喉嚨喊一喊我底沉悶的心曲嗎？</p>
<p>一個失掉了家的，孤獨的流浪人，在酸楚的永恒中度着幽幽的落魄的生涯，眞是有着一種敎人難以忍受的苦味呀！這情調猶如一而黑網，掩掩實實地網住了我底整個的心靈，却使我窒息得喘不過一絲氣來。我沒有白天，黑夜是我底狹小的世界。悲哀的翅翼離不開我底週遭。我咒詛白天，也咒詛黑夜。不知什麽會激動我，環我痴痴的發笑。然而也不知什麽會激動我，嚷我怯怯的發哭。晚上，我成了習慣的是沒曾睡下一回，愛孤零零的一個人徘徊於星斗照耀的死靜的街道中。我覺得這是我的最快樂的片刻了。我從小留心去數着時日，連我底生日那天，我就嚷它偷偷的過去了。我底心情是一天一天的蒼老了。秋天，冬天，一片樹葉子落到我底身上，我茫然地打了一個冷顫！但我並不吃驚，我是從從容容的站下。我知道季節的轉變又在我脚下翻動了。因此我要大聲呌一陣。可是我底呌聲是啞的。我底身邊又是那麽寂寥，我看不到一個人影子。（骷髏倒有一大堆，由它去吧，終究是要毀滅的！）我開始想我確實是太孤獨了，我需要友伴，我更需要新鮮的空氣。</p>
<p>但是夜氣是形成了一團迷濛的霧。</p>
<p>我小心翼翼地走。我怕跌了跤。我底路旁却是兩道很深很深的泥溝。</p>
<p>這樣，過了一年，兩年，……悲哀是已不再屬於我了。家，家，就是生我的那個家，我簡直不敢再把它裝入我底思想裏。我怕它會撥撩養我，嚷我不安於路途上的跋踄。那是一個多麼易於刺激我煩惱的蛆蟲呀。</p>
<p>家，家，家底影子漸漸地在我底思想裏消減了。</p>
<p>就在冬天，我也不再想家了。</p>
<p>（家鄕的雪在我底夢裏發着一片白光）</p>
<p>在到處都有流浪人之家的路途上，我曾見到各個一同的季候打我眼前經過。譬如說，南邊的冬天，那是不容易常見到下雪的天。這是使人一點不痛快的事。但在北邊的冬天那就不然了，寒冷已換了另一個面貌，滿地覆着雪花，山野却染滿了一片白色。</p>
<p>我從沒曾因下雪而停止我的行走，在路上我覺得非常快樂。我常常對山野狂呼。也常常對雪低吟。雪在我底靈感中是再熟悉沒有了。它是我底忠實，旅伴。我始終沒有咒詛過它，我覺得它是可愛的。總是它有時被猛烈的西北風捲着撲上我底臉來，但我疾速地奔走着，沒有多大工夫，我底身子會浸在汗流裏。臉上冒着熱氣，雪花漸漸變成水了。我走着，我聽着踏在脚底下的雪沙沙地嚮。聲音眞是新鮮呵。</p>
<p>但是，有時，我也曾給雪的吹打，在山村之家病過幾决。好了，我還是不會咒詛過它。它是可愛的。它是我底忠實的旅伴。</p>
<p>冒着雪，我曾經到過不少的小的市鎮。因此我結識了幾個心投意合的靑年朋友。</p>
<p>在冷冷的額爾古納河畔，每天都有我們幾個靑年朋友的影子。河畔上的雪，却深深地踏遍了我們浮浪人的足印。</p>
<p>可是，意料之外的，我底那幾個靑年朋友，最後終被黑暗的惡勢力呑歿了。餘下了我，孤獨的，仍然是一個流浪人。</p>
<p>現在，冬是來了。北荒山野的冬景又該一片白色了吧？</p>
<p>於是，我底思想煩擾着雪的夢。</p>
<p>我逝去的雪地上的艱苦生活。我逝去的幾個被難的靑年朋友。</p>

<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>舊俄時代的作家，往往借用戀愛故事，表示其政治意見，雖然頗有其故事文學上的成就頗好，使讀者看來，只感到是純粹的藝術，而不覺其有政治意味，但讀者對作者的別有苦衷，也往往是諒解而且同情的。在中國的文學作品裏，有一部份的無題詩，可說是以同樣手法製作，但其態度，每幷不怎樣嚴肅，故所能表示出的幷不是一確定的意見，而只是一些纖巧的手法，到讀者看時，作者的原意已不能被注意了。作者或者也未嘗不希望能作更深切的表示，但環境實限制住他。要借戀愛觀表示政治觀，是先需能儘量抒寫其戀愛覜的，而談戀愛的在舊中國，却正如談政治的在舊俄，同樣可以成爲罪名。因此，與用戀愛象徵政治相似的，倒不是那些寓意的無題詩，而轉是那些借仙鬼寄託人間戀愛的故事。以下　統稱仙鬼　事。大概因爲中國的禁談戀愛的積習太深了罷，作者的不得已而那樣描寫的原因，似乎目來似不曾有人注意過。到現在，仙鬼故事的叙述，似已成舊式文人最可嘲笑的一點，這實在是頗有點欠公平的。大凡被抑制的感情，都會以奇特的方式鬱發，仙鬼故事的叙述，有時實不能不認為是舊日文人抒發其被抑制的感情的一種方式。被抑制的感情的激發，往往是偉大的作品的成因，雖然仙鬼故事中幷沒有產生怎樣已達到可如預期那樣好的作品，但也未必都該一筆抹煞。</p>
<p>拿近代的狐鬼故事，和唐人傳奇者比較，大概是可以慨嘆作品的墮落的。我們就內容看，可以看出其愈後愈荒誕，但我們也不能忘記，其中一部份的原因，是由於束縛的愈後愈緊。由會眞記的可以流傳，我們知道唐人對戀愛確有相當的寬容，而後人對這篇却很起議論，因篇中所叙述的是張生，推測這主人翁是張藉，遂非難張藉，也有推測是作者自叙，遂非難元積。後世的作者，見到這樣的遭遇，自然不敢再蹈覆轍，貽後世的議論，何况或者譏論幷不須待後世，而當世就會來非難呢。唐人的神仙際遇傳奇，也大概並不是虛構，而是穩藏着實際的人間事件的，正如李商隱的無題詩，其所包含的事實，如明說在當時就足賈禍，因之不能假託之遇仙，張驚的游仙窟所記，大概所遇的也就是一個驕奢淫佚的公主沈亞之的晋祠記中甚至望到古代的后妃，也未嘗不可說或竟事涉宮闈。如果可以這樣推測，則借怪誕的面目以掩飾眞實事件的巧妙手法，是做到相當效果的。後人專蹈襲這巧妙的手法，不能不說是很自然了</p>
<p>傳奇方面由後來的筆記承襲，一方面也發展而成爲通俗小說。才子佳人式的小說，也可以說是傳奇的一條正脈。這一方面，似乎是着重在人間了，但我們一看道些小說的故事的千篇一律，我們就立刻感到所被允許寫的人間，實在小得可憐。無論說作者的才能是怎樣的低下也難使我們推定其連企圖脫出的囚籠的一點志願也沒有，作者實在不是不想脫出，而是不被允許脫出。花笺的作者，在開首，就說明他主意道：「但能兩下全終始，便偷期密的又何妨。」這全終始的限度幾乎是全社會以全力來維持牠，於是才子佳人書，遂不得不總是那樣可憐。一個作者如想寫更廣大的人間，到是反不能不寄託於仙鬼上去。</p>
<p>自然，我們不能說，凡是仙鬼故事都是有其人間的背景的。道家思想，在中國有久遠的根據與不斷的流播，好爲悠渺虛誕之說的風氣是很盛行的，自然也會產生許多造作的荒誕的故事。但我們也可以說，道家忍想的能興儒家思想不斷地並流，實囚爲他有人情上的根據。道家因不斷地受儒家排斥，其所搆造的理想世界，遂只被置之天上，道家原來，未嘗不是想把人間，造成這樣一個世界的。如果道家思想曾有像儒家思想那樣佔有勢力的一天，則所虛構的故事，大概也未嘗不可用人間作背景。經過劇烈變動後的現代生活狀况，被鄕僻間的舊派人聽到，在他固執着儒家敎義的時候，固然大嘆氣搖頭，但有時也感着如聽美麗的神話，這也足以說明被抑制的感情怎樣在想抒發。</p>
<p>這種被抑制的感情，一被解放，則仙鬼故事，自然絕跡。這從狎邪小說興起以後，聊齋式的筆記就逐漸衰微，可以看出。被認爲狎邪的最初作品的品花寶鑑，允其顯出這樣的趨勢。有人說書中的主角琴言，完全不像男性是這書的弱點。但我們對這書似乎不必把他當作是實寫朋比優伶的情形看，其寫法可說仍只是一種寄託，則寫出的常然不會不像女子。這書和以後的狎妓的小說，是不全相同。娼妓的描寫，因受實在的對象的限制，雖然作者盡力要把其暈化，却常不能如願，所以最後終成形成九尾龜那樣。這樣却是從一個狹的人間走出，又走人另一個狹的人間。這方面巳不足再抒發被抑制的感情，而時代也變了。讀者是早已有翻譯的言情小設可讀，作者也敢模做西洋作品而寫言情小說了。玉梨魂的廣大的銷行，說得力於鴛鴦蝴蝶派的文體，是還不如說得力於能訴諸一般人求解放的感情的。到這時是可以眞的人間的人，代替虛構的仙鬼了。照情理說，眞的人是要描寫得比仙鬼更活躍，而作品中感情的流露該更優美的。但就到現在，我們似還不能在新作品尋找得出好多超過仙鬼故事所寫的動人的影子。文學上的偉大成就是很難達的，那末仙鬼故事在文學作品也不算最少成就的一項，而以爲牠是最可菲薄的了。</p>

<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>我們南洋的報館看守不是披散着濃鬚子的印度亞三，却是一個老得很快，沒有五十歲就白了頭髮，樣子有點　僂的汕頭人，是很引起我的奇怪的。就在我到這里來當了一名小編輯的第二天，因爲那位經理先生是親戚，便在一個談話的塲合之下向他說了：</p>
<p>『印度亞三不是更具備着看門的本領嗎？我們那看門的太不威嚴了！」</p>
<p>聽話的人笑起來：「可不是？我說你到底年紀太輕，還不能讓你當總編輯。你現在的工作是想法子把報屁股弄得好一點，這就是你的職業。爲什麽要向看門的人發表意見呢？」</p>
<p>「眞的，我太不喜歡他了了…」我唧哼着，走出經理室。</p>
<p>這傴僂的老人呌做湯丙。白了頭髮還不算，牙齒邊脫落了幾顆，臉皮縐得很難看。日里邊他坐在大門口，用遲鈍的眼睛向每一個進來的人望望，一聲也不響的。我們的是午報，所以正午時分特別擠擁，一些派報的傢伙也是從大門出入的，於是喧鬧而且雜亂，湯丙絕對沒有法子維持秩序。他害怕人家，偶爾他也向一個不守秩序的派報者用低沉的聲音呌着</p>
<p>「不要亂嚷，不要……」</p>
<p>「你說什麽，老東西？」</p>
<p>當那個人回過頭來，用兇惡的臉色正對着他，像碰見了什麽天大的壓抑似地，湯丙立刻沉默着，再也不敢干涉他們了</p>
<p>是這樣無用的看守……</p>
<p>我的工作本來是並不麻煩的，有許多空閑的時間給我坐在編輯室里看各地寄來的報紙和雜誌。也許是常常經理先生到這里來都看見我閑在那里的緣故吧，有一决他把我呌了去，用極和氣的態度要我在辦事檯旁邊的沙發上坐下來，然後吸着雪茄，對我說：</p>
<p>「過兩個月我們報館是三週年紀念，我想呌你來弄一點什麼…譬如特刋吧…」</p>
<p>「好的。可是我…」</p>
<p>「他們都比較忙，」他這樣打斷了我。「我看還有那麼長的時間，你就担當起來吧，鍜鍊一下你自己也是有好處的。」</p>
<p>這樣，我必需負起兩百多頁的紀念刊的責任來了。這裹的報館是照例不給稿費的，我以我沒有法子找人家去寫文章。我想在道兩個月里邊該是我最煩忙的時候了。</p>
<p>距出版的日子一天一天地近了，我在經理先生不斷地摧追之下决定了趕夜工。於是差不多每天晚上，爲了要參考書時底方便，我都上報館去工作。在那里，和湯丙接近的機會就多了起來。</p>
<p>「陳先生，你辛苦了。」他疎　地拐進編輯室的門，這樣地向我說着。</p>
<p>「嗯…」我覺得他闖了進來簡直是搗亂自己的思想，應了一聲以後，正想拾起頭來呌他出去，却看見在電燈光下的他，和靄地笑着，手里捧着一杯茶，微微有點抖悸地放在桌上去</p>
<p>「要茶水，陳先生儘管叫我好了。」他說。</p>
<p>我點着頭。是的，有的時候口乾了要水也不知道呌誰去，報館里一個人也沒有！看守的湯丙自然無論什麼時候都在道里，夜里他身上蓋着單薄的毛氈睡在門邊。可是我從來不曾使用渦他。</p>
<p>「外邊很冷吧？」我看見他還站在那里，便隨口問了一句。</p>
<p>「還好。陳先生一個人在這里不也很寂寞麼？」</p>
<p>「說寂寞，你一定更甚吧，湯丙！」我索性放下筆，和他攀談起來。</p>
<p>湯丙苦笑着：「我們有什麽法子？命注定了的。陳先生，如果我的兒子不死，那情形該不致於……」像觸起了他的傷感似地，吶然說不下去了。</p>
<p>我想，讓湯丙有一個機會傾洩一下他心頭的積鬱吧。就問起他的身世來。他馬上像得到知己似地坐下來向我說着：</p>
<p>「陳先生，什麽都是命註定了的。我曾經有過一個兒子，這小東西老實說一點也不差，他很用功讀書……我早就想年老靠兒子，享兒孫福是人生最快活的事，所以他母親死了，我並不怎樣傷心；我一心一意地培養着他……有一决我到神廟里去求了籤，說我如果不好好修行，是享不成兒孫福的；陳先生，我那里不善意地修行呢？祇是我一個月只有三十元的薪水，還得供給兒子的學費，那時候我是一個木匠。」</p>
<p>「那末你的兒子……」</p>
<p>「神籤是靈騐了，我沒有這種福氣。兒子十九歲那一年患了傷寒死去了！」</p>
<p>「哦！」我應過了一聲，把背脊向椅柄上一靠，從湯丙的滯澀的眼眶里，看見流不出來的一束淚水。</p>
<p>我用同情的眼光望着這老人，可是我始終說不出什麼話來。他相信神，相信命運；他缺乏對於現實認識的能力。最後我問道：</p>
<p>「那時候你有沒有送他進醫院？」</p>
<p>「陳先生，我們是窮苦人哪，醫院是進不成的，所以…」</p>
<p>是十一點鐘了。他應當到外邊去把門鎖起來，把自己睡在那下面，這樣他可以取得二十塊錢的薪水。但是他臨走的時候還不住地喃喃着：</p>
<p>「命註定了的有什麽法子」</p>
<p>沒有多久道看守的老人是病了。而且是絕望的病。經理先生把他送到平民醫院去。我去探望他的時候他很關心三周年紀念刋出版了沒有；問我還在晚間上報館去不。我覺得他消瘦得只剩骨架了……</p>
<p>過幾天湯丙就絕了氣……</p>
<p>看守換了印度亞三，高大而且威嚴，每一决我走進那大門他都向我行一個禮，姿勢有點滑稽。但我常常想起那傴僂復弱的湯丙直到我回國的時候。</p>

<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>兩性間，父母子女間的愛，有時表現得異常奇怪，—簡直違反了通常的行爲的。</p>
<p>有一决我在省城遠香大街一間汚穢無光的，被煤烟熏黑了的小房子裏碰到一個女人。那里的二房東朱覺先是我底朋友，一個靠騙術吃飯的看相人。失業五個月以後，我因爲沒有地方住搬到他那里去的。</p>
<p>她是一個十九歲的母親，每天到一家藥材店去做活，她底丈夫在一間錫器店做打雜，兩家合起來一個月可以賺十四塊錢。他倆底男孩子呌做阿禺，剛滿兩歲，聰明而壯健。</p>
<p>三十年代—我們有着一個野蠻，暴戾，殘酷的世界，被頌揚或稱道的是無恥的武力，咀咒和說謊，被我們聽見的，這是眞理，我們在隨便一處街頭巷尾，用隨便一個人物證明它　事實上，我所碰見的那個婦人，結婚以後的生活是痛苦的。她當着許多人面前公開地講起以前的事，從她底家鄕到他們度「蜜月」的增城，非常詳細地，歸結到她底不平的申訴。好像下等動物似地，她被貧窮，和自己的男人虐待着；好像下等動物似地，她虐待着她自己的孩子。</p>
<p>常她無辜地痛打那個自已還不能說出完全的語句來的孩子的時候，她底隣人們，羅四太于根嫂，補鞋匠陳滿，淘井匠畢通都走進來圍住她，用種種話說服她。</p>
<p>「你們知道什麼？你們知道什麼！」她放肆地痛駡着，「我底親生骨頭親生肉，打兩下都要你們管！……他這黃瘟不止來討債，而且是來討命的。你們那裏懂得？」</p>
<p>「你當心，你嬰是打死了他，」淘井匠畢通咆哮起來了，「我們可容不得你！—狗母不如的狠心腸！」</p>
<p>「來，你們誰敢動手就來」</p>
<p>假使她用這同樣的話激怒了她丈夫，那火氣旺盛的男子，他就用拳頭敎訓她，「疼愛」她，重車地搥她底背部和胸部，不和她說一句話。她會跑出街外，坐在地上喊救命，從口裏吐出鮮紅的血液來。</p>
<p>「替我看一看相吧，」她這樣要求過我底朋友朱覺先。</p>
<p>「女人用不着看相的！」那相士回絕了她。「你男人底命相就是你底命相。」</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>上海又有人創立一間飯店了，不過這飯店不是供人小酌的飯店，而是給狗寄膳食的狗飯店。報載：海格路獵狗學校開辦後，雖每月收費達五十元，但受訓練的獵狗，仍甚衆多。該校主人，爲擴充範圍起見，近又開設一狗飯店，每日供給膳食兩决，膳料以牛肉爲大宗，按月收膳費洋十八元。惟學校的獵狗每月五十元的費用，膳宿等費，已包括在內，可不必另納。本市中西蓄狗人士，因狗飯店頗爲便利，故日來携其愛狗，赴該飯店就食的，甚形踴躍云。</p>
<p>常見一般有錢人的蓄狗，每愛護有加，視若子女子食。食則牛肉，坐則汽車，有的夜裏還伴着一床睡。現在這問狗飯店，也正是應這需要而開辦。聞狗飯店在歐美各國的大都市中，甚爲普遍。按日收費很昂，每較勞工階級的膳是爲貴。但生意的興隆，亦不亞於人飯店。這决海格路設立的，在中國還是破天荒的創舉。今後家有蓄狗的，自是方便不少。這眞是狗的幸福！</p>
<p>但當我們方在替狗欣慶的時候，却聽到一個家人合夥出來搶刦衣食的消息，叫人十分掃興。這事發生在南市城廂各處，一般鳩形鵠面的窮人，糾集數十人爲一組，沿途向點心店攫取饅頭大餅等物充飢，無一倖免。間有鳴警到來，則食物早已入腹，店主亦只有徒喚奈何。還有某衣作，前日雇老虎車，裝儎製就的棉袴三百套，欲運往某洋貨號交貨。不料道經小北門，突有衣衫襤褸之輩，一鬨上前，竟被刦去棉袴六條。迨警察趕至，他們已逃逸無踪了。這却是人的不幸！</p>
<p>照我們所知道，上海的包飯，每月每客僅需六七元。在託兒所寄嬰孩，每人每月亦只十二元。現在這間狗飯店，一日供給膳食兩决，按日收費就要十八元，生活程度實比人高得多。而且，做狗有福分進飯店，做人要衣食，却必須出於冒險一搶！相形之下，那得不叫人嘆息一聲：人不如狗！</p>
<p>惟這裏所說的人，是指的窮人，有錢人就不然了。例如近日寒暑表漸漸向下降低，一部分無衣無食的可憐入，已經餓死凍死了！另一部分富人，却正在暖氣如春的室中，吃燕窩魚肝油，等待着看雪！朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨。這兩句話，最足爲這一現象寫照！</p>
<h3 id="c210">雪 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 華穆</p>
<p>上海雖說是江南地方，總不比南方嶺表之地，冬天沒有雪下。不飛雪的冬天它的臉像豈不乾燥得使人難受麽？那邊的冬天，你雖然也聽得到呼呼的北風打窗戶之外颯然掃過，但也看得見靑黃相間的樹葉。你就把它看作是江南的秋天，聊以解嘲罷，但當你抬頭望見抹在樓角的雲色，又會使你心裏的明朗的秋之感覺悶然消去呢。</p>
<p>現在總可放心了，你不用再惦念着。雪要待到幾時纔下呢？說出來會見笑人的。自然哪，假使你是住在北方地方，這個念頭也不用挨到現在還吊在喉嚨頭。北方老早就飛過雪，有些河海而且都結了冰，不能走船了，你看到受到的只是漫天遍地的凍，漫天遍地的冷！那</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>樣的景象不正是冬天的臉像嗎。上海到底是屬于南邊地帶，冬天自然來得遲些；然而近幾天來的天氣，攝氏寒暑表上的水銀不是已降到二十幾度了嗎？你看沒有太陽的天空，層積的凍雲，下雪總不會遲到兩天以外的，只要今晚或明晨飄起雨點，就可看見片片雪白的雪花漫天飛飄起來，再把大地蓋成一片白！那時你家庭階之上也會厚厚的堆着幾寸高的雪花，叫你驚愛，不忍把泥污的鞋底踩上去糟蹋牠的潔白。你應當心滿意快了，你驚喜，你歡跳，恨不得自己也分化成一片片的白，在天空飛，在天空飄，然後不驚動的蓋在樹枝上，草地上；待到太陽來了，就映閃出耀眼的光輝，美麗中不缺少莊嚴氣槪。于是纔輕輕的溶解做點滴的水珠，滋潤到埋在地下的花草的種子上去。這樣的夢不夠華美絢爛麽？</p>
<p>但，你也總得尋個法子來消磐消磨這美麗的雪天纔是，打雪仗，堆雪人呢，都是小孩子玩的事，你或感不到興趣。踏雪尋梅麽，又太雅一點了，而且也要近便有梅可尋纔得。上海有的是柏油馬路，更無什麽山嶺可言。卽使公館庭園裏不會找不到梅，但個個人可未必就有一個大觀園那樣的園子。人家園子裏的只可隔墻望望，（也許連望也望不到）自然哪，你有興緻就乘火車到蘇州鄧尉去也未使不可，不會有那麽煞風景的人來干涉你。只是這個玩法究竟不是個個人做得到的。那麽還是求其次罷？你總有朋友，下雪了，不妨發個小柬把他們邀來，烤着火爐，煖壺熱酒，大家來一個縱談天下古今的圍爐會，但可不必强人作詩，這是名士們的濫調，儘可留給他們去作。可惜上海買不到鹿肉，不然你還可以效史湘雲賈寶玉蘆雪亭生烤鹿肉的故事，那味道兒包管你又濃，又香，又野！</p>
<p>白天你算混過了，也許累了罷，夜裏自然不會想到出門去的。睡覺太早，躱在床上未必睡得着，（若是有了太太的，這時自然由你，恕我還沒有太太，這道味兒說勿出。）這時最好還是學學古人，「雪夜閉門讀禁書」的快事，那風趣味只能由你親去體，文字是難描說的·這里所指的禁書範圍原很廣，并不一定指穢褻書之類。你想戶外又風又雪，這深夜還有誰來作這不速之客，叩你門扉呢。你儘可暢懐放胆的讀個痛快，人生快樂事還有過此的嗎？</p>
<p>總之，雪能使你高興，能使你快樂，能使你忘記寒冷，能給你一個又華美又絢爛的夢。我不希望你作名士，作雅人。豪放時儘無妨盡情豪放。但不必矯情作態。</p>
<p>等着罷，雪總會落下來的。</p>
<h3 id="c211">捕鳧底老人 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>一連刮了三天夜底西北風，天氣可眞有點兒冷勁了；那些在一個月以前還留着殘餘葉子的老桑樹，如今也已成了光胳膊，眼前是顯得一片死灰色，已找不出一些自然界裏的生氣了。</p>
<p>野鴨三在床上翻了一個身，看見瓦罅隙裏已經有點朦朦亮了，於是他就一骨碌從那被窩裏爬了起來，披上了那襲同他年齡一樣老邁的舊絮襖；伸手去把那扇板窗推開了。可是一陣尖銳的冷風直向裏面撲了進來，不由得使他將　子往衣領裏一縮，接着就本能地打了一個寒襟！他走出了房門，將一隻烟籃掛在手臂灣裏，到門間裏去掮了那支櫓，把兩扇野狗可以纘出躦進的白木破門掩上了，在銹鐵環上加了鎖。走過了小橋，將自己的捲邊毡帽使勁地往下拉了一把，挾挾緊腰，冒着那凜烈的寒風，向河灘走云。</p>
<p>風，很有力地在空中捲，那些光樹幹子也給捲得在不住地打躬作揖　枯草上却舖着一層濃的嚴霜，白得仿佛昨夜下的雪一樣·他走下　繫在河灘那株矮檀樹上的破小船裏，擱好了櫓，將烟籃塞在船頭底下了，然後拿起一把沒有梢的高粱掃箒來拭去船樑上的霜屑。</p>
<p>「不知又是那一個小鬼，拿船纜也斬斷了」！他去解纜的時候，發現那根粗蔴的纜繩上有一半已給斬了兩個刀痕</p>
<p>小船向廟山渚頭飄出去，漸漸地飄進了西太湖：風捲着白浪，儘抬起了頭向那隻小船撞來，激得船身像是一匹溜繮馬似的，在一望無際的險浪裏掙扎，狂奔。野鴨三是扳住了櫓人頭，咬咬緊牙關，在船艄上顫戰着。浪花在船邊上拍着，許多水珠子飛濺得他一身一臉，半襲破絮襖也給打濕了。</p>
<p>太陽也跟着那條小船，從凹處爬出來，慢慢兒的向天空進行，可是一出山坳，陽光就給風吹淡了，淡得像是一個肺　患者的臉，那麽頽喪地，慘敗地，好像有意和野鴨三開玩笑，時而一露，時而又隱入了雲翳。</p>
<p>他將小船謠過了三山擋，遠遠地就望見一片枯灰色的蘆葦，於是他加緊搖了幾櫓，船就到了蘆葦畔；他呵呵手，兩隻手是凍得像是給截了指頭一般，人也有點麻痹了。</p>
<p>將船身挨淮了蘆葦叢裏，記清了昨天張「仙人跳」的所在，一隻二隻三隻……的去收起來：</p>
<p>「咦！怎麽一隻也沒有張着，難道昨天這樣冷的天氣也不來嗎」？他心裏這樣想着，就覺得有點失望了！</p>
<p>昨晚他在這裏一共放了二十隻竹弓，介是倒有十八隻空着，袛捕着兩隻野鴨，而且還是雄鳧。他把一些繩子竹弓全丟進了艙裏，嘆了一口冷氣，坐在船樑上拍起潮烟來。</p>
<p>蘆葉給風吹得瑟拉瑟拉的咡，這聲音是那麽荒涼而悽絕，在他耳朶裏聽來，簡直有點像是無數人為着饑寒而在號泣，並且裏面仿佛還有他母親老婆和孩子的聲音。</p>
<p>頽喪地把船搖出了蘆葦，向着灤門裏進去；但，這時的風已比剛才緊　，太陽也躱了起來，天空是塗着一層濃重的鉛色，大地也變成了灰黯，像是馬上要壓坍下來的樣子；而同時，野鴨三的心裏也像澆進了鉛一樣地沉重，意識是仿佛糊上了一層灰紙一樣地陰黯——</p>
<h3 id="c212">都市的悶天 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 璜</p>
<p>一到都市來，連在鄉村里所享受的大自然的贈與亦一起被剝奪了。湫溢的亭子間里，終日看不見一片日花，打開窗兒望過去，三面削立的灰色的高牆擋住你的視線，小小的房子就像落在一口深井里，卽使望到天，亦是那麽陰沉，那麽狹小的一角，全失去了牠原來那種高曠的，明亮的風姿。夜里，沒有月亮，沒有星星，有的是無垠的黑暗。</p>
<p>在這樣的境地里，人是悶塞而又陰鬱的，如果外面再洒着，飄牛毛雨，那麽這種情調是一個人所最難以忍受的吧</p>
<p>這幾日來，天色又是陰沉沉的，就像一片鉛，卽使是中午，看天色却跟黃昏差不多，鎭日里亮着的電燈，那昏黃的光綫，更添了心頭的悶鬱，坐亦不是，站亦不是，只好傍窗看那旋捲着的雨絲，但還是掩不了心頭的寂寞。夜里，睡聲嗒的雨，聽起來越加凄冷了，滴些床上，想着一些完全渺茫的事情，那在自己亦不曉得為什麽會浮上心頭來的渺茫的事情。</p>
<p>在回家的路上，又遇雨了。站在一家店子的玻璃簷下避雨，靜靜地看着那些像黑雲的一樣的來往的來人，他們大都瑟縮着，打斜着身子走路，霓虹光反映在柏油路的積水上是蜿蜒的紅色的長蛇，電車却像一隻由水里爬上來的巨獸，街燈又像一粒粒含淚的巨眼，冷冷地吊着雨中的市街。這景色在我雖然還是弟一遭遇到，但我却極端地厭惡牠，這樣衰頽而又狼狽呀！</p>
<p>天才的法蘭法書家萬高曾說，「在陰雨的故鄉，想着南國的太陽，使人煩膩」。這流浪的藝人的心情，我是深深地體騐到的了。</p>
<p>本來，現在亦該是降雪的季節了，但也還是滴滴答答的下着雨一天過了又一天，一夜過了又一夜，多麽煩厭的天時呵！我高興雪色潔白體，一喜歡，我更高興太陽，它溫暖我，激發我，又給我光明，然而黑暗却遮蓋了它，把我們扔在深淵里，什麽時候才得見太陽呢？這時候我不覺這樣的禱求了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Second Student March in Beijing: Petitions Filed at Government and Executive Yuan, Slogans Shouted Along the Way, Order Extremely Good,翁文灝's Reply Satisfactory, Government Does Not Shirk Responsibility, Citizens Should Obey Discipline, 王世杰 Issues Statement: Occasional Drastic Actions Cannot Remedy the Difficult Times <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th, 9:00 AM: Over 8,000 students from ten schools including Jinling University, Jinling Women's University, Jinling Middle School, Huiwen Girls' High School, Sanmin, Anhui Middle School, Dongfang Zhongying, Nanjing Middle School, and Agricultural College gathered at Jinling University's sports ground and set off. At around 10:00 AM, they arrived at the National Government to petition, sending representatives 赵迺让, 李集, 曹穠瀰, 周泗, 张继祖杲景奎, 刘宗岳, 林楝, 龚维祺, 张景昭, 管中元, 谢筹田, 许松华, 王文炳, and twenty others inside to request a meeting with Chairman Lin. The Government dispatched military aide 朱文中 of the Civil Official's Office and 萧铮 as representatives to meet them, informing them that Chairman Lin was not at the National Government. They then withdrew and went to the Executive Yuan. All the students gathered in the open space inside the gate of the Executive Yuan. Representatives (ten people) went to see Secretary-General 翁文灝. 翁 appeared at 2:00 PM, stating that he had always been engaged in academic circles, but was now ordered to handle government affairs. He understood that the authorities, in this time of serious national crisis, deeply understood the gravity of their responsibilities, and their anxiety was many times greater than ours. They are now burying themselves in hard work, hoping to save this critical situation. He had forwarded all the points of your requests to the authorities and they are under consideration. He hopes that we do not neglect our studies and jointly bear the national crisis, earnestly work to achieve our goals. What I said today, some may not have heard, will be published in a written statement in tomorrow's newspaper. Subsequently, Lei Zhen, Director of General Affairs of the Ministry of Education, publicly explained that no representatives from Beijing students had come to Nanjing, and the circumstances of the unsuccessful search for the representatives' whereabouts. At about 1:00 PM, all the students marched in formation, shouting slogans along the way, passing through Taiping Road, Confucius Temple, Zhonghua Road, and arriving at Zhongshan Road, dispersing and returning to school at around 3:00 PM. In addition, students from schools like Central University attended classes as usual. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Nanjing municipal party and government authorities convened a meeting with the principals of various schools at 9:00 AM on the 19th. Zhou Bomin, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Committee, and Chen Jianru, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, separately spoke about everything, hoping that the principals would persuade the students to concentrate on their studies. After the meeting, the Social Affairs Bureau received reports that students from various schools had set off to petition again and dispatched supervisors and instructors to various schools such as Gu Zhong to investigate. It was learned that in addition to some students participating in the petition, some were still attending classes at school and were very stable. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Several thousand students from major middle schools and universities in Nanjing gathered at Jinling University at 8:00 AM on the 19th and set off in formation at 8:30 AM to make a second patriotic demonstration. They shouted slogans along the way and the order was extremely good. At around 9:00 AM, they arrived at the National Government, requesting an audience with Chairman Lin. He was not in the Government building, so Secretary Zhu Wen Zhong, and Section Chief Xiao Qin of the Document Bureau met with them and promised to convey their message. Afterwards, they went to the Executive Yuan, sending twenty representatives inside. 翁文灏 received them and gave a reply to all, which they all found satisfactory. They withdrew and marched, dispersing at around 1:00 PM and returning to their respective schools. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Students in Nanjing have petitioned the Executive Yuan for two consecutive days, and Secretary-General 翁文灏 received them. The main points of the conversation are roughly as follows: The government authorities are deeply aware of the importance of national affairs and the necessity of safeguarding national rights and territories, and are working hard. They will never shirk their responsibilities. The President of the Executive Yuan, Jiang, has repeatedly explained the diplomatic policy, which is understood by all. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will abide by discipline so that the government can concentrate on its work. The points raised in the petition will be earnestly conveyed to the authorities and the government will do its best to deal with them as soon as possible. It is hoped that the students will not neglect their studies and maintain order. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the student movement in Beijing and the expressions of sympathy from students elsewhere, Wang Shijie, Minister of Education, issued the following statement to a reporter from the Central News Agency on the 19th: The main reason for the failure of student patriotic movements in the past has been the destruction of school discipline. If the normal discipline of the school cannot be maintained, not only will students' studies be neglected, but also because teachers lose their guidance, those with impure motives or other agendas will be able to manipulate and exploit it. As a result, the student movement will become increasingly worse, society will lose sympathy, and public security organs will have no way to deal with it peacefully. The student petition wave in 1931, which ended in arson and other atrocities, can serve as a warning. Therefore, all pure patriotic youths must not first destroy the discipline of the school itself with actions such as strikes, marches, and petitions. If we love the country, the movement will inevitably self-destruct in an instant. As a cultural center, Beijing has always been very important in the education sector. With the national crisis deepening, the importance of Beijing's education sector is now even greater. Students in Beijing must not incite major changes in this dangerous environment, leading to the destruction of schools and the suspension of education. The central government has already made a decision to open up speech and news, and the government is implementing it. In the future, if students have opinions on politics or current affairs, in addition to preparing for practice, they already have a legitimate way to express them. Only by following this legitimate path, earnestly and continuously paying attention to issues and discussing issues, can it benefit the country. Short-term, occasional, and drastic actions cannot remedy the difficult times or save the country from danger. Therefore, writing this will be a more progressive manifestation of youthful patriotism in action, and will produce results that are thicker and more satisfying, which will depend entirely on whether the teaching discipline of each school can be maintained as usual, and whether the students' rationality can restrain all ineffective and harmful conflicts. The Ministry of Education is determined to supervise all schools and educational administrative organs in a responsible manner to prevent all strikes, marches, and petitions.

The authorities deeply sympathize with the injured police officers and plan to offer condolences separately.

<p>Beijing: The presidents of various universities, including Jiang Menglin of Peking University, Mei Yiqi of Tsinghua University, Xu Songming of Pingmin University, Lu Zhiwei of Yanjing University, Chen Yuan of Fu Jen Catholic University, Li Linyu of Sino-French University, and deans and department heads of various schools and colleges, totaling more than 50 people, gathered for a luncheon at the Overseas Returned Students Association this afternoon. During the meeting, the authorities of each school reported on the situation of their respective schools and discussed ways to persuade students in the future. Jiang Menglin said that the responsible persons of each school are still doing their best to persuade students about the student demonstrations, so that the students can concentrate on their classes and not neglect their studies. As for the rumors that various colleges and universities will have an early winter vacation, it is not true. The authorities of each school have not considered this matter yet. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Song Zheyuan replied to the principals of various colleges and universities, saying that there was no arrest or detention of students.

After the police and teachers earnestly persuaded them, the students went to class as usual this morning. But now they suddenly went on strike, which was unexpected. The school authorities strongly urged the students to go to class because the Japanese side protested that the students shouted slogans against Japan during yesterday's march. After the first class this morning, the students received an order from the Student Union to strike, so they immediately stopped classes. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">More on the Student Patriotic Movement <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>This newspaper has already commented on the revival of the student movement after receiving the first news of the Beijing student march and petition on the 11th. At that time, the argument was that the Beijing students felt a deep and heartfelt pain and rose up to petition to express their feelings. It is appropriate to deeply understand their actions and to feel for them. The student movement can also publicize their grievances and stimulate public sentiment. It can also serve as a backing for diplomats to negotiate and should be given considerable respect. However, what is said here is still limited to the situation at that time and is only to urge the government and society to understand. In the past ten days, the situation has developed. On the one hand, the patriotic movement has been responded to nationwide. Thanks to the enlightened attitude of the central and local authorities, the students' petitions have been satisfactorily resolved. On the other hand, the Beijing police and constabulary have used force to stop them, resulting in the Beijing students having messages of re-excitement and renewed petitioning. The news deeply regretful has continued to reach our eyes and ears, and Northern public opinion also feels its seriousness and expresses anxiety. Today, in addition to asking the responsible authorities in Beijing to change their course and do everything possible to satisfy the pure wishes of the students so as to eliminate the worrying situation, the reporter will further elaborate on the essence of the patriotic movement.</p>
<p>First, the seven demands of the first Beijing student petition (see the Beijing dispatch in this newspaper on the 14th) are actually the main purpose of this patriotic movement, and the subsequent movements in various places cannot be outside of this. The seven demands can be summarized as opposing territorial division and demanding freedom. Regarding the demand for freedom, judging from the recent facts, except for the special case of Beijing, it seems to have been quite successful. By pursuing this, it is not hopeless to obtain guarantees for various freedoms. Regarding territory, the attitude of the new central administrative authorities has been clearly seen. He Yingqin of Beijing has said that "the authorities here are all rich in national thought, and the changes in personnel do not affect the unity of the country." Song Zheyuan also said that "all measures are based on the interests of the entire country." Since verbal guarantees have been obtained, the emphasis should be on monitoring whether they can practice what they say, and this monitoring seems to be more appropriate to take a serious posture. It is unlikely that a high spirited and enthusiastic attitude will have the desired effect. This is one of the reporter's understandings of the recent student patriotic movement.</p>
<p>Second, the important effect of the student movement is to vent public opinion. At a time when the country's fortunes are declining and the whole country is gloomy, young students can disregard their own interests and rise up bravely. Its value and effect, taking the past events of ancient and modern China and foreign countries as examples, are all worthy of mention. Recently, the rulers of Beijing, Guangdong, Tianjin, Hangzhou and other places have been able to treat the students with an unconventional and good attitude, and social groups have also risen up to respond with sympathy. This is the manifestation of the value and effect of the public opinion of the recent student patriotic movement. Under this circumstance, the authorities are vigilant and traitors are fearful. Since the results have been achieved, it is appropriate to return to normal. Recently, discussions on "saving the country by studying" and "resuming classes" have gradually risen, not to hinder the student movement, but to say that there are other ways for students to save the country and that one cannot hinder other things by using petitions as the only way to save the country. This is what the reporter hopes that hundreds of thousands of young students across the country will understand.</p>
<p>Third, the recent rise of students in Beijing and the responses in various places seem to place the military in the position of dealing with the normal situation in Beijing and assisting arrested students. According to Song Zheyuan and others of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, they may not have other intentions. What is regrettable is that they act impulsively and regard students as enemies. In this environment, there will be no good results for both sides to confront each other. A better solution is to temporarily take a wait-and-see attitude so that the central government's orders, such as what Secretary-General Weng allowed the students, can have the opportunity to be tested, and the school authorities in Beijing can also calmly engage in the work of demanding the release of students. The reporter believes that everyone has a patriotic heart. If Song and others change their course, they can stand in the same position as the students participating in the patriotic movement and work together to achieve the purpose of the patriotic movement. This is also the opinion that the reporter wants to exchange with the students.</p>

Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, served as the translator. Ambassador Arima inquired about the diplomatic policy of the new Executive Yuan. President Chiang replied that the diplomatic policy should follow the declaration of Mr. Yu in the past and the remarks made by Foreign Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. The established policy will be consistent from beginning to end and will never be changed. After having some refreshments, Ambassador Arima and others withdrew at 5:40 PM.

<p>Nanjing: Japanese Envoy Arima has visited President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang to congratulate them on their new positions. After completing his business in Nanjing, he will return to Shanghai on the 20th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Zhang Qun, the newly appointed Foreign Minister of China, clarified China's diplomatic policy in Nanjing on the 18th. China will resolve all diplomatic cases with friendly countries on the basis of mutual benefit and equality, and eliminate the existing unequal treaties by legal means. The Japanese Foreign Ministry originally hoped that China would adjust the relationship between China and Japan on the basis of mutual benefit and equality. Therefore, Foreign Minister Zhang expressed his sympathy by following the policy of Wang Jingwei and declaring to the people that he would actively adjust the relationship between China and Japan. As for the demand to eliminate unequal treaties, it is not a new policy suddenly put forward by the Chinese government. It is indeed one of the major policies of the Kuomintang since President Sun established the Guangdong government in 1923. Moreover, Japan also suffered such unequal treatment when it opened the country, so it can understand China's position. However, the political, economic, and social conditions in China are not yet pure. China should first establish its own system and prepare modern national institutions before negotiating the cancellation of unequal treaties. (19th Japanese Union Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The speech by Zhang Qun at the time of taking office, welcoming China's foreign policy, and diplomatic observers sympathized with Zhang's efforts to abolish unequal treaties. However, China must first rectify its internal affairs before demanding abolition, so as not to affect its friendly relations with other countries. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

After Xiao took over the seal, he gave a brief speech, saying that his knowledge and experience were insufficient, and he hoped that everyone would double their services to repay the country and would not lightly move anyone. At 11:00 AM, the ceremony was completed and photos were taken. According to Xiao's interview with the press, he had declined several times after being ordered, but he was not approved. At this time, the situation was difficult, and people's hearts were floating. He was also urged by people from the central and local governments, so he resolutely accepted this important task. He still hopes that the media will give more guidance. As for municipal measures, he will wait until he understands all parties before making careful plans. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

A row of soldiers from the 961st Regiment of the 132nd Division of the 29th Army, armed in plain clothes, assisted the police of the Public Security Bureau and the military police in densely deploying along the Yuewei Road Main Street. The auditorium was in the large living room. The ceremony was simple, without reading a will or silence. It ended in just five minutes. The guard was still strict when taking pictures.

(19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: On the 19th, slogans opposing Xiao Zhenying as the Mayor of Tianjin, signed by the China People's Association and the Hebei People's Autonomous Association, and leaflets supporting Cheng Ke's continued service as Mayor were found in the city. Slogans written on white cloth were posted on Dongma Road, outside the tunnel, and at the East Station. They were all posted at about 4:00 AM on the 19th and were made by an autonomous country faction in a certain concession. Xiao Zhenying said that after the central government announced his appointment as the Mayor of Tianjin, he had repeatedly declined, but was not approved. Recently, because Pingfang wrote about the rush of business, he planned to postpone his arrival in Tianjin to take office for a few days. Now, in order to urge former Mayor Cheng, and because local public security is at stake, and students petitioned again yesterday, he rushed to take over the job, fearing accidents. The municipal government personnel are not planning to change. The city organization will also remain the same. From now on, we will continue to engage in good neighborly politics, regardless of good or bad, and there will be a definite evaluation in the future. (19th Dispatch)</p>

(9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin. The issue of abolishing the puppet Anti-Communist Association of eastern Hebei will be discussed in Beiping. Song Zheyuan himself will engage in talks with Tada and Doihara to find a more satisfactory solution. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. The unfolding situation here indicates that if the eastern Hebei government is to be abolished, it will require the replacement of members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, ensuring that it contains more autonomous features as a price. According to reliable Chinese sources, this realization stems from the failure of the Political Affairs Committee's initial determined effort to abolish the eastern Hebei government. When Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying met with Doihara yesterday, they discussed the issues of eastern Hebei and eastern Chahar. It is reported that Doihara stated that he could not consider abolishing the eastern Hebei government, but if the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee changed its name to the Hebei-Chahar Anti-Communist Autonomous Council, he would be willing to discuss the matter with Yin Rugeng. Doihara's attitude towards the Chahar issue is said to be quite firm. It is reported that the Chinese side has expressed its willingness to allow the Mongolian Security Force to manage Guyuan and four other counties, but not including Baochang and Zhangbei counties, while the Japanese side insists that all six counties, including Guyuan, must be placed under the jurisdiction of "Manchukuo." Xiao Zhenying will continue the discussion after returning to Beiping. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

According to information obtained here, the current fighting is not a major counteroffensive, but military authorities are confident that a counteroffensive has already begun or will begin soon. As for the plans of the Abyssinian Emperor, they are being kept strictly secret. (18th Guomin News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome. The Vatican had planned to imitate the approach taken during the Bolivia-Paraguay war in South America, requesting that Italy and Abyssinia cease hostilities on Christmas Day. Whether this can be achieved is doubtful. Although the Vatican has repeatedly consulted with the Italian government on this matter, due to the recent development of the situation on the African front, there has been no indication of a cessation of hostilities, and large-scale battles are feared to occur in the near future. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tigray Front. According to this news agency's reporter Barr, fierce fighting has recently taken place between the Italian and Abyssinian armies in the Tigray River basin on the northern front. The Abyssinian army is led by General Imiru. This army was bombed by the Italian Air Force twice and scattered on the way when it departed from Gondar City for the Telake region at the end of November. It was then reassembled and launched an attack on the Italian army. It is reported that an Abyssinian officer originally planned to lead his troops to surrender to the Italian army. When the Abyssinian Emperor learned of this, he dispatched General Motodaq to the Tigray River basin to prevent it. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin. The news of British Foreign Secretary Hoare's resignation was met with surprise in Berlin. General public opinion is that Hoare's resignation is due to a change in British policy. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told Reuters reporters that this is purely a British matter and Germany is merely an observer. Political circles are currently paying close attention to whether the British government will bow to domestic pressure and change its policy towards Italy. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Abyssinian Question: A Major Upheaval - British Foreign Secretary Hoare Resigns - Baldwin Rumored to Concurrently Hold Foreign Secretary Post - French Political Situation Also on the Verge of Change <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare has resigned and the government has not attempted to retain him. Although official circles have not yet stated the reason for his resignation, it is widely believed to be due to widespread opposition in Britain and elsewhere to the peace plan he and French Prime Minister Laval formulated in Paris. Hoare intends to complete his questioning in the House of Commons today and, as a member of Parliament, provide a personal explanation. No successor has been determined for the Foreign Secretary post at present. It is rumored that Prime Minister Baldwin will concurrently hold the post, or that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will be transferred to head the Foreign Office. The House of Commons hopes the new Foreign Secretary will be a truly great figure. If Chamberlain does head the Foreign Office, supporters of the government will be greatly satisfied, and the situation could become calmer, as even opponents of the government would feel somewhat relieved by Chamberlain's leadership. It is said that if Chamberlain is transferred to head the Foreign Office, the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer might be given to Churchill. It is reported that Hoare resigned at 6:30 PM last night, deciding to take a six-month rest. At a time when the situation is increasingly tense, Hoare's departure could make the government's position slightly easier, but the turmoil has not subsided. Supporters of the government feel they have no way to face the nation after last week's events, and there is a strong sense that the government will be reorganized. In any case, the important debate on the peace plan in the House of Commons today has been altered by Hoare's resignation. It is now heard that Conservative MP Winterton will move an amendment to the Labour Party's impeachment motion. According to reliable sources, this amendment states that the House of Commons, on the one hand, recognizes that any solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute must be acceptable to the League of Nations, and on the other hand, is willing to fully support the government in carrying out the foreign policy stated in its manifesto and approved by the people in the general election. Hoare had prepared a 4,000-word explanation to be delivered during today's debate, but it is widely believed that as his remarks are now personal, their scope may not be as broad. It is heard that Hoare believes the amendment proposed by Parliament is tantamount to impeaching him personally, which is also one of the reasons for his resignation. Hoare is 52 years old and has served in politics since the age of 25. In early June of this year, during a cabinet reshuffle, Hoare was transferred from the position of Secretary of State for India to head the Foreign Office, having served for just over six months. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to reliable French sources, the resignation of British Foreign Secretary Hoare will have an impact that makes the positions of French Prime Minister Laval even more precarious. Laval only received a majority of 54 votes in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, which could not be considered satisfactory. It is widely expected that if another vote is held tomorrow, hundreds of votes will shift away from yesterday's support. Some quarters believe that Laval may follow in Hoare's footsteps, and will inevitably fail in the Chamber of Deputies next week. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris - It is rumored that following the sudden resignation of former British Foreign Secretary Hoare and the resignation of Hervé, Minister without Portfolio, from the leadership of the Radical Socialist Party, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval may also resign. Pessimistic views are quite prevalent in the lobbies of the Chamber of Deputies. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris - It is widely believed that Hervé's action is the prelude to the collapse of the Laval cabinet. The general opinion is that if a new cabinet is formed and a suitable figure cannot be found to take the helm, Hervé, despite his previous statement that he would not form another cabinet, can still be expected to accept the position. Hervé's cabinet would be extremely pro-British, supportive of the League of Nations, and would assist the Emperor of Abyssinia in opposing Italy. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>Compromise Focused on Maintaining Anglo-French Unity - As Many As 200 MPs Asked Questions</p>
<p>London - Hoare, who resigned as Foreign Secretary this morning, explained the process of drafting the peace plan in his personal capacity during the debate on the peace plan in the House of Commons this afternoon. Hoare entered the House of Commons to cheers from the government party, sitting quietly in a corner of the chamber. At 3:46 PM, Hoare, in calm and clear language, asked the House of Commons to be patient, as the matter was very complex and had special difficulties. He said that he had gone abroad for medical advice and had been injured in a fall, preventing him from immediately returning to handle the issue, which led to misunderstandings and criticisms. Now that misunderstandings have taken root, it is very difficult to defend himself. Since taking office as Foreign Secretary, he felt that there were two major issues of urgent necessity: 1. To exert his utmost ability to prevent the spread of war in Europe; 2. To prevent a separate war between Britain and Italy. The government has received reports from various sources stating that Italy would consider an oil embargo as a military sanction, or would take action to declare war on Italy. No matter what threats Italy poses, we are determined not to fear them. If Italy attacks us, we should retaliate. Historically, we have always retaliated against those who offend us, and achieved complete victory. But we have a concept in mind that such a separate attack on one country, without the full assistance of other countries, would inevitably lead to the division of the League of Nations. The Paris peace plan is the minimum basis for the French government to proceed. He himself was dissatisfied with several specific points of this plan, but he felt that the matter was of great importance, and the continuation of the Italo-Abyssinian War was even more serious, so he recognized that the matter was worth trying, as maintaining Anglo-French unity was a necessity. We are now entering a more dangerous stage. Apart from the British fleet in the Mediterranean, and the additional deployment of troops to Egypt, Malta, and Aden, no other member states of the League of Nations have sent a single ship or mobilized a single soldier. During the House of Commons session, the public gallery was extremely crowded, and as many as 200 MPs asked questions. Debate arose in the chamber, causing many answers to be inaudible. The Speaker had to repeatedly intervene to restore order. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">A Major Change in British Politics - Varying Rumors Regarding the Reasons for Hoare's Resignation <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>London - The sudden resignation of British Foreign Secretary Hoare has had a profound impact on official circles here, who believe it is the most shocking event in British politics since 1914. People in France are undoubtedly shocked, as this event is sufficient to greatly affect the compromise recently reached in Paris between Britain and France on the Italo-Abyssinian issue. During Hoare's negotiations in Paris, he consistently demonstrated his superior insight, courageous spirit, and the merits of being practical and unpretentious, with concentrated focus, which was praised by people in France. It is generally believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech at the inauguration ceremony of the new village of Pontinia in that country yesterday made Hoare feel embarrassed, and thus he could not avoid resigning. In short, this move will inevitably have a profound impact on the situation of the League of Nations General Assembly's current discussion of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute in the short term, and its significance is by no means ordinary. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London - The Foreign Secretary telegraphed his resignation today. Some days ago, various parties had anticipated this, but yesterday the news suddenly shifted to the belief that a cabinet crisis had been avoided, and Hoare would not need to resign. The reason for Hoare's resignation is probably that there were too many opponents to the peace plan he and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval had drafted, and the published White Paper mentioned that Hoare had instructed the British Ambassador to Italy to strongly urge the Abyssinian Emperor to accept the plan, reaching the peak of opposition. Some in the House of Commons even called this action "shameful." At the same time, Prime Minister Baldwin spoke in the House of Commons today, stating that the French government had assured Britain that if Italy attacked the British fleet in the Mediterranean, France would back Britain. This assurance has long been known to everyone, but it is only now being publicly confirmed in the House of Commons. The Associated Press also learned from reliable sources that Hoare's resignation was actually due to disagreements within the cabinet over the draft of his speech to the House of Commons on Thursday. It is understood that Hoare wanted to make every effort to defend his actions, while Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain wanted Hoare to admit his mistakes. Therefore, Hoare's resignation was deeply surprising even to Baldwin, but he accepted it shortly afterward. The selection of a successor has not yet been determined today. All parties believe that Eden is the most experienced. Sir Eric Drummond also intends to resign due to several months of illness. It is said that Hoare himself deeply felt that Eden had not provided assistance in Geneva, so he had no choice but to resign. (National News, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Sir Samuel Hoare, the Foreign Secretary, has submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Baldwin, resulting in a change in the British political situation. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech at the new village of Pontinia this morning, in which he said, "All the selfish and hypocritical people in the world have come out to oppose us. We are determined to deal with them with generosity and passion, and victory will ultimately belong to us." These words were clearly directed at the British people. After hearing this speech, the British Conservative Party was extremely indignant, and the political turmoil suddenly intensified. The Foreign Secretary then also decided to resign. It is generally believed that after the Foreign Secretary resigns, the target of all attacks will no longer exist, and the government will easily gain the support of a majority of MPs when it attends the House of Commons tomorrow.

<p>London - Since the resignation of former Foreign Secretary Hoare, the senior official in the Foreign Office, Sir Eric Drummond, immediately followed suit and submitted his resignation. To date, the government has made every effort to retain him, but political circles believe that the government will probably approve his resignation. After his departure, Sir Alexander Cadogan, the Ambassador to China; Sir Ronald Lindsay, the Ambassador to the United States; Sir Miles Lampson, the High Commissioner to Egypt; and Sir Leith-Ross, who is currently investigating financial and monetary conditions in China, are all hoping to succeed as Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

<h3 id="e44">British Newspapers Mostly Express Sympathy for Hoare's Resignation - Believing He Maintained Good Demeanor - Baldwin in a Dilemma <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>London - The Times stated in its editorial today that there is a honorable custom in British political circles that any cabinet member who is closely related to a failed strategy must resign. Now, Foreign Secretary Hoare's resignation is in accordance with this custom. Hoare was implicated for failing to prevent an indefensible proposal, and should be sympathized with by the general public. The government should regard today's debate on the peace plan as an opportunity to explain the reasons for its actions and to soothe people's hearts. This newspaper believes that the process of restoring British policy and prestige should begin from now on. The Daily Telegraph editorial said that Hoare's resignation is a sad interruption in a very promising career, but the public recognizes Hoare's resignation as a normal course of action, as this peace plan is criticized from all sides. The resignation of the Foreign Secretary will hardly reduce the seriousness of today's debate. The Morning Post stated that Hoare's resignation is of course intended to ease the serious situation for which he should be responsible, but Hoare is only a tool of the policy for which both the British and French governments should be responsible. The Daily Mirror stated that if Hoare's resignation can strengthen Baldwin's position, it would not be surprising. The people will listen to his speech in the House of Commons today with sympathy and attention. The Daily Express stated that Hoare's resignation is a victory for the left-wing Conservatives. Baldwin surrendered without a fight, offering Hoare as a sacrifice to the opposition party. However, it is difficult to understand why the helmsman has fallen into the sea, while the captain is still in office. The Daily Mail stated that Hoare is taking the blame for others, and the situation will be chaotic and uncertain due to his resignation. The Daily News stated that Hoare's resignation can help restore British prestige, but the Prime Minister has hardly escaped the dilemma of being in a difficult position, and has failed to overthrow a colleague to restore the cabinet's credibility, and this colleague's speech on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute at the League of Nations General Assembly greatly contributed to the Prime Minister's victory in the general election. The Daily Express stated that the method of having two foreign ministers and two foreign policies has plunged us into a situation of disaster and humiliation. It is hoped that from now on there will be one foreign minister and one foreign policy based on the League of Nations. The Manchester Guardian stated that the issue now is the origin of the peace plan. Although Hoare has now resigned, the government cannot shirk the responsibility of explaining this matter in detail. The Liverpool Daily Post stated that Hoare's resignation was almost inevitable, but it is also very regrettable, as Hoare had gained a good reputation before negotiating the peace, and was considered a talented foreign minister. Eden is already in Geneva, we recognize his policies, and Hoare had no choice but to resign for the sake of dignity. The Nottingham Daily Express stated that the British government has repeatedly failed to weaken its resolve regarding the aspirations of French politicians, resulting in the underestimation of British policy. The Berkshire Observer stated that British politics should not be suspected of being dominated by French influence. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Radical Party Leader Hervé Also Resigns <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>And Will Withdraw From Cabinet</p>
<p>Paris - Hervé, the Minister without Portfolio and former Prime Minister, has resigned from the leadership of the Radical Socialist Party today. Informed observers expect the cabinet to resign, as Hervé is clearly no longer able to make all the members of the Radical Socialist Party support Laval. Some party members believe that the party can be divided into two factions, one still led by Hervé, and the other supporting former Prime Minister Daladier. Those who are friendly with the government have also admitted today that a cabinet crisis may occur. Before Hervé resigned, he gave a speech at a meeting of his party, during which some people shouted "Stop this farce." Hervé also rebuked party members, saying that they had first supported the peace plan, but in the Chamber of Deputies, the majority voted against it. "I cannot both lead a political party that attacks the government and be a member of the government," so he suddenly said. (National News, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party met last night to discuss the government's policy on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, which immediately led to fierce debate. There were many speakers, and the debate lasted for a long time. As a result of the debate, Hervé, the Minister without Portfolio, finally resigned from the leadership of the party. Previously, all the members of the Executive Committee, except for five who expressed dissent, unanimously passed a motion advocating that the party's position be made concrete. Unexpectedly, as soon as the motion was passed, Vidal, a left-wing fighter of the party, stood up and spoke, vehemently attacking Hervé in his personal capacity, saying that he should not collude with the government, disregard the League of Nations Covenant, and willingly be deceived by Prime Minister Laval. Hervé was very indignant when he heard this, and immediately announced his resignation from the leadership of the party to the Committee. Although the Committee strongly urged him to stay, Hervé's intention to resign remained firm until this morning. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris - Hervé, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party and Minister without Portfolio, has resigned from his position as party leader. Recently, there have been rumors that Hervé expressed dissatisfaction with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute resolution plan proposed by Britain and France, and was considering the issue of his continued service. Later, his attitude became more moderate, apparently striving to avoid a cabinet crisis. Until yesterday, when the Chamber of Deputies discussed the foreign ministry's budget and voted on a motion of confidence in the government, only more than forty members of the Radical Socialist Party voted in favor, while more than eighty voted against it. In this situation, Hervé had only two paths to follow: one was to resign and cause political disputes, and the other was to resign as party leader to apologize to the party. Finally, because the internal and external affairs were at a critical juncture, not allowing for any changes, he resolutely resigned as party leader to preserve the overall situation. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - Hervé, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, also hinted that he might withdraw from the cabinet. Hervé is the son of a gendarmerie officer, from a poor family, and is now sixty-three years old. He has held the premiership three times, and his tireless efforts are highly respected by the people.

<p>Due to Complications Arising from British Foreign Secretary's Resignation</p>
<p>Rome - The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party held a meeting last night that lasted a very long time. No resolution was made regarding the Paris peace plan. According to the Il Giornale d'Italia, after studying the political situation related to the peace conditions, the Council decided to postpone the meeting until December 20. The postponement of the Council's meeting is widely believed to be due to the resignation of British Foreign Secretary Hoare, which has made international affairs confusing and uncertain. Because the Council is still unclear about what policies the British government will adopt in the future, it believes that it is appropriate to wait until the British House of Commons debates foreign policy today before holding another meeting to discuss everything. People in Italy all believe that Hoare's resignation and the reasons for his resignation have greatly reversed the progress of the peace talks. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party met at the Palazzo Venezia at 10 PM last night, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini. At the beginning of the meeting, Mussolini paid tribute to General De Bono, the former High Commissioner to East Africa, saying, "De Bono's name will be inscribed in history alongside the recovery of the cities of Adowa and Magdala," etc. The Supreme Council is now scheduled to continue the meeting on the 20th. After adjourning today, a brief communique was issued stating that "The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party studied the political situation generated by the Italo-Abyssinian dispute resolution plan proposed by Britain and France," etc. These few words were not considered unusual by the general public. Official circles said that those who participated in the meeting today were all senior officials, which shows that the Council must have studied the possibility of Italy's long-term resistance to sanctions. It was also said that the government's foreign policy will definitely announce its outline before the end of the current session of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party. Regarding the speech delivered by British Minister without Portfolio Eden at the Executive Council of the League of Nations yesterday, and the resignation of British Foreign Secretary Hoare, and the resignation of Hervé, the French Minister without Portfolio, from the leadership of the Radical Socialist Party, officials here believe that these are major events, and that the changes in the European balance of power can be seen here.

<p>Geneva - The official reply of the Emperor of Abyssinia regarding the peace plan proposed by Britain and France was recently delivered to the Secretariat of the League of Nations by the country's representative, Gedamu Wald. The content briefly stated that "Regarding the peace plan, no responsible body of the League of Nations has entrusted anyone to draft it, and to submit the draft to the countries concerned." It also stated that the Executive Council of the League of Nations has already reserved the right to mediate. Moreover, when French Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare conducted negotiations, the Abyssinian government was not invited to express its views. The Abyssinian government had previously sent a note to the British government, explaining the principles that should be followed in resolving the dispute. Later, before this plan was sent to his country, he requested the French government to meet with his country's ambassador to France, and also requested to obtain this plan, which should be clearly announced by the League of Nations as not in line with the various principles of the Covenant.

<p>Geneva – The representatives of Britain and France attending the League of Nations Council today stated that they were prepared to abandon the peace plan if the League of Nations could not fully endorse it. The British Minister without Portfolio, Eden, said that the two countries always intended that the plan should be approved by the League of Nations. The French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Laval, sent a letter to the Council requesting that it modify or reject the parts of the plan that it did not approve. He believed that if the League of Nations could not accept the entire plan, it should continue to strive for a "reasonable and fair solution." After receiving Laval's letter, the Council announced an adjournment, but it may hold a secret meeting tomorrow to allow the countries to express their criticisms. The Albanian Minister to France and representative to the League of Nations, Marian, delivered a lengthy speech today, declaring that Albania would never accept a peace plan that involved the colonization of its territory. Thus, the peace plan of Britain and France has apparently become a thing of the past, and the League of Nations representatives can only figure out how to dispose of its remains. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Geneva – Yesterday, after the British representative Eden and the French Prime Minister Laval spoke at the League of Nations Council meeting, the view that the Paris peace plan, initially embraced in Geneva in early November, was dead was confirmed. As a result, the mood shifted from disappointment to excitement. The two statesmen's speeches were quite short, both stating that if the plan could not satisfy the wishes of the members of the Council, they were willing to abandon it. It is expected that when the League of Nations Council holds a closed meeting today, the representatives of the Soviet Union, Spain, and Denmark will all deliver important speeches, but they will not launch unrestrained attacks, as the plan has now been abandoned. However, it is felt that if the Italian government's reply to the peace plan indicates acceptance, Laval will definitely oppose extending sanctions against Italy to oil and other key commodities. During yesterday's Council meeting, Eden spoke first, recalling that the Sanctions Adjustment Committee had endorsed the attempt to find a basis for discussion between Italy and Abyssinia. He then spoke of the efforts of the British and French governments to create the Paris plan, saying that the two governments had a crucial condition in mind, namely, that the terms of peace should be subject to the League's approval, before being imposed on Italy and Abyssinia. All League members were bound to respect and strive to fulfill the obligations of the League Covenant. The task the two governments had undertaken was not easy, and given the current turn of events, almost impossible. Nevertheless, they had to try their best. He could not apologize for this. Even if this attempt did not succeed, the goal of reconciliation remained, and this should be recognized by the League. Therefore, even if the plan could not be implemented at present, its principles were justified. Eden went on to say that the peace plan was not presented as something unchangeable. It was presented in order to learn the views of all parties involved in the dispute. Therefore, if the plan now before the meeting did not contain essential conditions acceptable to all three parties, the British government could not continue to apply for or support it. It was the British government's view that this particular attempt to resolve the dispute was not even close to achieving its goal, so the British government did not wish to continue it.</p>
<p>Laval spoke, expressing great sympathy for the spirit in which the two governments had drawn up the peace plan. He went on to say that he did not know how Italy and Abyssinia would respond to their proposal. He suggested that the Council avoid making a firm decision before receiving the Italian and Abyssinian replies. However, he felt that he should announce at this time that if this attempt could not obtain the support of the parties concerned, the Council should decide on its own and not disregard any honest method based on world peace.</p>
<p>Before the Council adjourned, the only other speaker was the Abyssinian representative, Mayang, who said that the Abyssinian government had submitted the Italo-Abyssinian dispute to the League of Nations and believed that it would be resolved in accordance with the principles and spirit of the League Covenant. The League Covenant must be respected, and Abyssinia could not accept a peace treaty of surrender or plunder. He did not believe that the League of Nations would abandon Abyssinia and hand it over to a brutal enemy. The only civilization Italy had given was incendiary bombs. Mayang then asked whether it was in accordance with the principles of the Covenant to force the victim of aggression to acknowledge the ceding of territory to the aggressor and to allow it to control more territory. Abyssinia had placed its own fate in the hands of the Council and reserved the right to present its views later.</p>
<p>The Chairman then announced an indefinite adjournment, saying that until the attitudes of Italy and Abyssinia were clear, the members of the League of Nations would naturally wish to wait for the meeting to reconvene to study the issue. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Geneva – The resignation of British Foreign Secretary Hoare is creating a stir here today. This news, along with the complete failure of the British-French peace plan, has increased hopes for the effectiveness of sanctions against Italy, and the oil embargo may soon be put to a vote. (18th National Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Geneva – There is shock and confusion here at the news of the resignation of British Foreign Secretary Hoare. Hoare made a very good impression when he attended the League of Nations General Assembly in September. It is felt that Hoare's diplomatic experience was still insufficient, and he was unable to handle the extreme difficulties of this international event properly. However, his ability to retreat from difficulty is a sign of his sincerity. The Abyssinian delegation openly admitted that they welcomed this news. Hoare's resignation is proof that Britain will resolutely uphold the principles of the League of Nations and its Covenant, and ensure that the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is resolved in accordance with these principles.

<p>London – Although the price of large silver bars here today was one and seven-eighths pence lower than yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department is still unwilling to purchase them. It is said that this is another step in the transfer of the world's silver market from London to New York. The silver prices in London and New York are still not equal, and this could make New York a better market for selling silver. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>New York – Today, the Hand Harman Chamber of Commerce broke the custom of the New York silver market by publishing silver prices before receiving reports from the London market. This is because the Treasury Department is buying in the Mound City market and selling in New York. The near-term Mound City silver market is higher than the far-term market, which is also why. Although Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has repeatedly stated that he will not abandon the silver purchase plan, it is generally believed that if this continues, the U.S. government will inevitably stop purchasing silver in foreign markets.

Banks now require a guarantee deposit of at least 25 percent for large silver bars. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington – U.S. Senate silver faction senators disagreed today on the continued decline in silver prices. The Thomas faction, which has always advocated raising the silver price to $1.29 per ounce as soon as possible, believes that the continued decline in silver prices is harmful. However, the Pittman faction believes that the decline in silver prices is not a cause for concern. Apparently, speculators in London, who had hoped for a silver price of 65 cents per ounce last week, were disappointed and no longer concerned about the market price, and engaged in dumping silver. The Pittman faction believes that the United States will continue to purchase silver, regardless of London market dumping of 10 million ounces. However, those who remain silent observers at the Treasury Department believe that the silver faction will still be confused after Congress convenes in January next year. However, if this faction can unite in the face of continued decline in silver prices, the situation will change again. (18th National Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Nanjing – The Ministry of Finance reported that batches of diesel imported through Xiamen, Hankou, and other places were tested and found to have a specific gravity and ignition point that matched the Grade A diesel tax rules, but the kerosene content was as high as 80% or more. Although the quality was inferior, after import, it could be used for ignition without refining. It was obviously specially manufactured to apply the low tax rate for Grade A diesel on the one hand and to sell it as kerosene without refining on the other, in order to make a large profit. In order to protect kerosene customs duties, it is necessary to prevent the continued import of this specially made diesel. The Executive Yuan has approved the revision of the Grade A clause of the diesel tax rules in Article 529 of the current import tariff, which will be implemented on New Year's Day next year, and has ordered the Director-General of Customs and customs supervisors to comply.

They came from South Manchuria at the beginning of this month to respond to the provincial government's invitation to explore iron, coal, lead, and other mines in Anxi. They are only responsible for technical tasks, while all other matters are handled by the Construction Department. There is no truth to the rumor that the South Manchuria Railway Company is investing. Li Qishan, who came with them, stated that hiring Japanese personnel is due to a shortage of such talent in our country, and hiring Europeans and Americans would be more expensive.

<h3 id="e92">Japan Increases Troops Stationed in North China, Kita and Muto Reach Agreement in Tianjin, Implementation Expected One Month After Approval <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin News: Colonel Kita Seiichi, Chief of the China Section of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, and Lieutenant Colonel Muto Akira, Chief of the Manchuria Group, arrived in Tanggu from Dalian on the Tianjin Maru on the morning of the 13th of this month, carrying orders from their military headquarters. At noon, they took the Beining Railway to Tianjin. Chief of Staff Sakai of the garrison army, senior staff officers Ishii, staff officers Nakai, Doeki, senior adjutant Otake, section members Hayashi, and Iida all welcomed them at the East Station. After getting off the train, they stayed at the Yamato Hotel in the Japanese Concession. Chen Yi and Li Zeyi happened to be in Tianjin and visited them at noon to discuss the North China situation. In the afternoon, around 2 PM, Kita and Muto visited Commander Tada at the Zhangyuan Commander's Residence and held a meeting focusing on the North China incident. Besides Tada, Kita, and Muto, those present included Sakai, Takeshita, Takahashi, Ishino (military attaché in Jinan), Otake, Ishii, Doeki, and Colonel Hasegawa, the commander of the Beijing unit of the North China Garrison Army, Colonel Kayashima, the commander of the Tianjin unit, Lieutenant Colonel Kagawa, the commander of the Tanggu unit, Major Nakajima, the commander of the Qinhuangdao-Yushuguan unit, and Major Onii, the commander of the Tangshan unit, totaling more than 20 people. Kita and Muto conveyed the central intentions of the military headquarters, and Sakai, Takahashi, and Takeshita reported on the recent situation in North China. After 3 PM, they discussed the reorganization of the North China Garrison Army and a plan to increase its strength. A principle decision was made at that time. That evening, Tada hosted a banquet at his official residence. After 9 AM on the 14th, Tada again summoned Kita, Muto, and the commanders of the various garrison units to discuss the budget and troop numbers for expanding the North China Garrison Army. After half a day of discussion, it was decided to increase the number of troops to around 3,000 to 2,400. In addition to Beijing, Tianjin, Tanggu, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Yushuguan, Zhangjiakou, Fushun, and Le, it is also planned to station a small number of soldiers in Tongxian and Ninghe, on the border of the war zone, for the purpose of protecting the peace and security of the war zone and for liaison purposes. The budget is being rushed to be compiled, and Lieutenant Colonel Muto will take it back after returning from Beijing to submit it to the military headquarters for review and approval in advance. It is expected to be implemented in January of next year. However, it is still undecided whether the troops will be transferred from Japan or whether a portion will be transferred from the Kwantung Army to be under the command of the North China Garrison Army. Kita and Muto took the Beining Railway to Beijing on the 15th to visit Song Zheyuan and others to observe the future trends of the North China situation. They are scheduled to take a plane to Chengde on the 20th to meet the commander of the 7th Division, and then transfer to Changchun to meet Commander Nanjirō. They will return to Japan by land on the 25th. Muto plans to leave Beijing on the 18th and return to Tianjin, then take a train out of the pass and return to Japan via Korea. The new Chief of Staff of the North China Garrison Army is Colonel Nagami Gotoku, a senior advisor to the military administration of the puppet Manchukuo, who is scheduled to come to Tianjin on the 17th with the new section member of the North China Garrison Army, Major Hamada Hiroshi, to take over their duties. The former Chief of Staff, Sakai, had already been ordered to return to the General Staff Headquarters in his country. However, because he is familiar with the situation in North China, he has been retained for two months to handle special affairs. The newly appointed Staff Officer Hamada will assist him in handling these matters. The Navy, which will coordinate with the expansion of the garrison army, has already established a naval port office in Tianjin by Captain Kubota, the former staff officer of the Ryojun Naval Port. The office is located in the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha in the Japanese Concession and has already begun operations. When necessary, the office can directly command the ships of the 14th Destroyer Division of the 3rd Overseas Fleet. The ships of the 14th Destroyer Division, the Hagi and Aoi, are docked in Tanggu, and the Kiku is docked at the Tianjin Special First District Wharf, with no intention of leaving for the time being. In addition, seven planes are still parked at the Nankai Balitai Airfield in Tianjin. Although they have not taken off recently, there is no preparation for them to leave either. The Navy, Army, and Air Force seem to be treating Tianjin as their base. If the increase in the number of troops stationed in North China is approved by the military headquarters, their future movements deserve close attention. (December 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Taiwanese Establish Xiamen Financial Association with Funds Subsidized by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office to Engage in Savings and Mortgage Business <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen News: After holding the Tropical Industry Conference and the Overseas Joint Conference in Taiwan, the Japanese have subsequently held the South China Japanese Consular Conference in Hong Kong, which is the beginning of Japan's southern policy. Although the content is secret, the plan is to develop economies in South China and Southeast Asia with Taiwan as the center. The region includes Fujian, Guangdong, Hong Kong, the Philippines, British and Dutch colonies, and Thailand. The business includes expanding the Japanese goods market, promoting shipping, and assisting the economic development of overseas Chinese in these areas. The "Xiamen Financial Association," which recently opened in Xiamen, came into being under this purpose. This organization is hosted by the Japanese Consul in Xiamen under the orders of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office and organized by the Taiwan Public Association. Chen Changfu, the former director of the Taiwan Public Association, is in charge. It opened on December 16th at No. 50 Zhenbang Road. Chen Changfu was elected as the chairman, Shi Fanqi as the standing supervisor, and Su Jiahe, the loan officer of the Taipei China and South Sea Bank, was transferred as the manager. The business executives are Wang Changsheng, Lin Mushi, Cai Jitang, Weng Junming, and 12 others, all outstanding Taiwanese residents in Xiamen. Its business is similar to that of a savings bank, but its lending is similar to that of a commercial bank. The items include savings, loans, guarantees, remittances, chattel loans, mortgages (i.e., acceptance and loan document mortgages), and business asset mortgages. The initial fund is 200,000 yuan, and another 200,000 yuan in low-interest funds are subsidized by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office for the start-up. The initial fund is raised from all parties by the initiators. Each share is 20 yuan, with 5 yuan payable first, and the remaining 15 yuan payable in 15 months. Each person cannot exceed 50 shares, and only those who are economically independent can join. If there are property owners, their wives can also subscribe to shares according to the rules. After the estimated fund is fully raised, those who wish to subscribe to shares will not be restricted. The more shares, the larger the business scale. In the future, branches may be set up in various parts of southern Fujian. It is said that its current business focuses on industrial mortgages. At a time when the local economy is sluggish, finances are tight, and banks have stopped lending, the association is rising to the occasion and doing what others are unwilling to do, so it is attracting attention from the general public. Moreover, the association's business is subject to the supervision of the Japanese Consul in Xiamen, which is a joint venture between Japanese officials and businessmen and is a general partnership. The articles of association have been drafted and sent to the Japanese consulate for review. At the opening ceremony on the 16th, Sakamoto Ryuichi, the chief of the foreign affairs section of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, happened to be passing through Xiamen, and Yamada Yoshitaro also attended the meeting. Chinese officials who went to congratulate them included Lin Guogeng, the commander of the Xiamen fortress. (December 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry Declines, Construction Department Director Requests Relief from the Provincial Government <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang News: Jingdezhen porcelain is one of China's special products. It was famous in the Tang and Song dynasties. The West used porcelain as the name for China, which shows its significance. In its heyday, there were 100,000 porcelain workers, and the annual output was always in the thousands and millions of yuan. In recent years, the world market has been squeezed, foreign porcelain has been dumped domestically, and the internal and external economy is in a slump, which has greatly reduced purchasing power. This porcelain, which is famous at home and abroad, is on the verge of collapse. Nearly half of the kiln owners and factories have closed down or suspended operations, and 40 to 50% of the workers are unemployed. Although the local authorities in the province have plans to improve and revitalize it, they are mostly just empty words and have not yet been put into practice. Now, Long Xuesui, the director of the Construction Department of this province, believes that the country's original handicrafts are declining day by day, while large-scale mechanized industries and heavy industries are limited by human resources, financial resources, and the dumping power of foreign goods, and there is no way to develop them in a short time. It is better to improve and revive handicrafts to relieve unemployed masses and dilapidated rural areas. Therefore, during this inspection of the water conservancy construction in Poyang, Leping, Duchang, and other places, he personally went to Jingdezhen for investigation and has now returned to the province. According to reports, Jingdezhen's porcelain industry used to have an output of 10 million yuan, but this year it is less than 2.78 million yuan. Its decline is alarming. If no measures are taken to provide relief, it will become more and more unbearable. Therefore, it has been decided to submit the matter to the provincial government meeting next week to seek urgent relief and permanent solutions. (December 15th)</p>

<p>The case of the county public security bureau illegally detaining Pan Sigui, the principal of the county vocational school, and beating and insulting him, which caused teachers in various literacy classes in the city to go on strike, has ended. The county public security bureau dismissed Huang Yifei, the squad leader of the student police who caused the trouble. After the county government reprimanded Chen Youmin, the director of the public security bureau, it instructed Huang Shizuo, the district chief of the first district, to find a way to resume classes. After Huang received the order, he summoned teachers from various literacy classes to persuade them, and Ouyang Zinan, the section chief of the first section of the county government, came to the scene to express his apology. Except for a few teachers who were willing to resign to maintain their integrity, most of them decided to resume classes on the 19th.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter, there have been as many as five cases of violent men stabbing women with knives in places such as Mayike, Daotang Lane, and Qingwu Square in the city. Although the public security authorities have strictly ordered their subordinates to intensify their investigations, no case has been solved so far, so the general public is deeply worried. Unexpectedly, news came that Xingbao, the daughter of Ge, who lived in Dabalangshi Lane in the city, was about 20 years old. At 5 PM on the 18th, while walking through the Guihefang mouth of Daotang Lane, she suddenly encountered a violent man who took out a sharp blade and, without asking why, stabbed Xingbao twice in the chest and shoulder before fleeing north. After being stabbed, Xingbao immediately shouted for help and chased after him, but he had already disappeared. Fortunately, the injuries were not serious and there was no danger to her life.</p>
<p>Trial Implementation of Public Prostitution Postponed</p>
<p>The Wuxian Public Security Bureau's trial implementation of public prostitution has been completed in terms of the registration of public prostitutes. There are more than 250 prostitutes in the first, second, and third grades. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on January 1st next year. However, because the public prostitutes' syphilis tests and the residents in the public prostitution area have not yet been relocated, it will not be possible to open on January 1st and will be postponed to February 1st. However, there have always been 35 singers in Suzhou who have all stopped working because they are unwilling to become prostitutes. The Public Security Bureau has recently been arresting private prostitutes without sparing any effort.</p>

Now, the province is eager to close the case and ordered the county to escort the prisoner to the province for review. The county sent bailiffs on the morning of the 19th to escort Chen and the former bank accountant Chen Jianren and cashier Wang, and the three of them were taken by car to the province for interrogation.</p>

<p>The business of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has been very developed in recent years, with annual turnover of several tens of millions of yuan, making it the only institution in the province to provide relief to rural areas. The bank's capital was provisionally set at 2.2 million yuan, based on the farmer bank funds collected from the counties by the end of June of the 20th year of the Republic. In the 23rd year, the provincial government's 637th meeting resolved to allocate Guantian land in Luomahu, Suqian, and appraise it to supplement the bank's funds. Therefore, as of the most recent total, the farmer bank funds collected from the counties, together with the funds allocated by the provincial government, amounted to 4 million yuan. The total amount should be changed to 4 million yuan to reflect the actual situation. The supervisory committee has now submitted this to the Ministry of Finance for record filing, requested the committee to forward the business license No. 110, previously issued by the Ministry of Finance, for cancellation, and requested a new license to be issued.</p>

I am ashamed and fearful of the great responsibility in these difficult times. I am replying to express my thanks. Chiang Chung-cheng, Hao Yuan."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Qianku: Agreed on Settlement Procedures; Settlements from Various Zhuang Begin Verification <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Shiye News Agency reports: The Qian Industry Preparatory Treasury held an executive committee meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the bank settlement procedures and the settlements from various Zhuang. Verification has now begun. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Agreement on Settlement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Qian Industry United Preparatory Treasury, affiliated with the Qian Industry Association, in view of the imminent bank settlement period and the approaching final settlement for the industry, specially convened the third executive committee meeting in the conference room of the treasury on Ningbo Road at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. Attendees included He Zhongxiao, Xi Jiming, Liu Wuqiao, Shao Yanshan, Lu Shuchen, Zhang Mengzhou, Chen Lishan, Wang Jimei, Zhao Songyuan, Shen Jingliang, Qin Runqing, Li Shoushan, Xie Taofu, Pei Yunqing, Sheng Xiaoshan, and fifteen others. Qin Xieqing, the general manager of the Qianku, was present as an observer. Chairman He Zhongxiao reported on the content of the meeting, the Qianku reserve fund, and the accounts of various Zhuang. There was careful discussion of the various procedures for bank settlement, which concluded at approximately 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Beginning of Verification</p>
<p>The Qianku is the central hub for the Qian industry, both internally and externally. The bank settlements received by various banks must be handed over to the clearing house representative to transfer to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The bank settlements received by various Qian Zhuang must be handed over to the Qianku representative to transfer to the three banks. The transactions are smooth and without any errors. Now that the Qianku believes that the Qian industry's accounts with the banks should be clearly verified, it has, based on the decision of the third executive committee meeting, notified all affiliated Zhuang yesterday to quickly send to the treasury a detailed verification of their accounts with the banks and transactions with other firms for the past year, in order to facilitate settlement with the various banks. At the same time, it will concentrate the current funds and total all temporary reserve funds of various Zhuang, in order to consolidate the foundation. Regarding loans from various Zhuang, it has been decided that starting next month, they will begin to be recovered or have interest settled and rolled over.</p>
<h3 id="e111">International Wireless Telephone: Initial Sino-French Test; Results Good, but Voice Still Lacking Clarity <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports: The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the International Radio Station are preparing for international telephone service. In the past two days, they conducted test calls with Paris, France, at the Liuheng Radio Station, with good results. The test calls were made using the second telephone set, which had just been installed. The station's chief engineer, together with a British engineer from the International Telecommunications Bureau, jointly opened the test and conducted it smoothly. However, due to the significant distance between China and France in terms of longitude and latitude, the voice was still lacking clarity. However, testing is still ongoing. According to the International Radio Station, the most difficult aspect of the Sino-French telephone test is the significant time difference, which makes the preparation process time-consuming. Although test calls have now begun with the other country, the time difference is as much as seven hours, which is greater than the time difference with the UK, causing inconvenience to both parties. The station has decided to make every effort to plan and ensure that the time for both parties is appropriately coordinated.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Xu Shiying Went to Beijing Yesterday to Meet with the New President Chiang <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces, recently, due to the reorganization of the central government, should have requested to resign from his position. However, the new President Chiang believes that Mr. Xu has been handling relief affairs for many years and has made great contributions. The central government relies on him greatly and could not allow him to retire immediately. He specially proposed this matter at the first meeting of the Executive Yuan, and after discussion, it was decided to retain him. Mr. Xu then stated that relief affairs were complicated, and he personally felt exhausted. He urgently requested the central government to appoint other capable individuals so that he could rest. Furthermore, the severe winter has arrived, and the flood victims in various provinces are suffering from hunger and cold, which is unbearable to witness. The issue of planting in the coming spring cannot be ignored. Before he is completely relieved of his duties, he should find a way to provide fundamental relief to prevent tens of millions of disaster victims from perishing or resorting to desperate measures. Therefore, at 1:30 PM yesterday, he took the Beijing-Zhabei express train to Beijing to meet with President Chiang and request a solution and to personally request his resignation from the position of Chairman of the Relief Committee again. He will return to Shanghai in about three to five days.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Zhong Siyun, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: "Having read the summary report on the financial situation by the Director of the Treasury of your council, it is clear that the economic situation of businesses and residents in the Shanghai International Settlement is declining, which is affecting the income from property tax and licenses. This situation cannot be changed overnight. Therefore, the only way for your council to plan its finances in the future is to reduce expenses as much as possible. For example, when hiring staff, Chinese employees with equal ability but lower salaries should be employed. Non-essential expenditures such as music bands should be deleted. The goal is to adapt to the living standards of the citizens. Actions that are akin to draining the pond to catch all the fish, such as overestimating property tax and increasing license fees, will not only fail to benefit revenue but will also accelerate the collapse of the market. They should be strictly stopped to nurture the tax base. Furthermore, this association has repeatedly sent letters to your council advocating the collection of vacant land and house tax, which is necessary for immediate adoption."</p>

<h3 id="e116">Officials and Businessmen Call for Relief for Industry and Finance Through Reduced Interest Rates and Inclusion of Land Deeds in Bond Reserves; Three Banks Ordered to Gradually Implement Inclusion of Land Deeds in Bond Reserves <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to gradually implement reduced interest rates in the market based on the social and economic situation. The Qian industry has requested the Supervisory Committee and the three banks to reduce the interest on loans. The Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the Ministry to allow land deeds to be included in bond reserves. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reduction of Interest Rates Ordered to Be Implemented</p>
<p>Leaders of the industrial sector, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, Guo Xu, Rong Zongjing, Nie Lusheng, and others, met with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to request that the government quickly establish a special bank or first have the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications allocate a large sum of money to relieve industry, so that entrepreneurs can fully utilize their capital. They also requested the Central Bank to reduce interest rates in the market and find ways to recover high-interest bonds to encourage the general public to invest in industry. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles that the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have already implemented overdrafts and interbank lending for the same industry, which indirectly relieves industry and commerce. The Real Estate Mortgage Bank is being planned by the Ministry of Finance and is scheduled to be established next spring. Regarding the reduction of interest rates in the market, the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to gradually implement this based on the social and economic situation. The three banks have now been ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Qian Industry Requests Three Banks to Reduce Interest</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously allocated 25 million yuan in financial bonds in 1935 to relieve the Qian industry and organized the Qian Industry Supervisory Committee. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were responsible for 18 million yuan, and various commercial banks jointly committed 4 million yuan. The funds from the Qian Industry Preparatory Treasury and various commercial banks have been repaid in full. However, more than 17 million yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications has not yet been repaid. Now, the Ministry of Finance and the three banks have agreed to temporarily postpone repayment. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from Qian industry circles that various borrowing Qian Zhuang have jointly requested the Qian Industry Supervisory Committee to forward a request to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to appropriately reduce the long-term interest rate of 8% on these relief loans. It is reported that the committee has forwarded the request to the three banks for consideration.</p>
<p>Land Deeds Included in Bond Reserves</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Regarding the request to submit a report, on the 17th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Land Bureau stating that, according to the Ministry of Finance's implementation of the new currency policy, various banks use 60% cash and 40% securities as guarantees for exchanging legal tender. If land certificates or land deeds are included in this 40% guarantee, it will further increase the credibility of legal tender and promote the circulation of funds. The economic and financial source of this city largely depends on real estate, just as South Africa depends on gold and Southeast Asia depends on rubber, without any difference. Therefore, to develop the economic and financial source of South Africa and Southeast Asia, it is necessary to promote the circulation and sales of gold and rubber. Similarly, to develop the economic and financial source of Shanghai, it is necessary to promote the circulation of real estate. The situation is the same. Now, with the implementation of the new currency policy, using 60% cash and 40% guarantees to exchange legal tender will invisibly increase the credibility of legal tender. However, the economic and financial source of Shanghai is largely in real estate, as mentioned above. Furthermore, our country has always been a country with import surpluses, and in international trade, it is a debtor country. Funds should flow out of the country. However, in the past few years, the circulation of real estate in Shanghai was high, and land prices were high. The funds obtained by foreign companies importing goods were more profitable by investing in real estate in Shanghai than by remitting them back to their own countries. Therefore, although there was an import surplus, funds did not flow out, and some even remitted their funds stored in their own countries to Shanghai to invest in real estate, which increased the inflow of foreign capital. However, in the past year or two, due to the imperfection of the real estate system, the real estate economy has collapsed. In addition to the draft of the Shanghai City Implementation of Land Practice Certificate Mortgage Rights Regulations and actively reorganizing and improving various businesses of the Land Bureau, we believe that to restore the economic and financial situation of a few years ago and increase the credibility of legal tender, it is necessary to include real estate as a guarantee for exchanging legal tender. In this way, it will not only have the above-mentioned effects on foreign capital, but also make the funds in the interior more active due to investment in real estate. Moreover, landowners are the backbone of society and the economy. If land certificates or land deeds can be used as guarantees for exchanging legal tender, they will naturally have a deep and close relationship of interests, thereby increasing the credibility of legal tender. If only stocks and bonds are listed as guarantees for exchanging legal tender, only a small number of merchants and industrialists who are smaller than landowners will gain credibility for legal tender. If the majority and powerful landowners are omitted, it seems that the development of the economic and financial source and the increase of the credibility of legal tender will not be complete. Furthermore, most merchants and industrialists are also landowners. Including land certificates or land deeds as guarantees for exchanging legal tender is even more desirable for them. As evidenced by previous examples, Germany also used land resources as guarantees to issue banknotes after the European War. It is not an accidental fact that they also saw this. Therefore, there is a considerable basis for habits and principles. Considering the social and economic situation and referring to the German precedent, we believe that it is necessary to include land certificates or land deeds as guarantees for exchanging legal tender. In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for consideration, we are presenting our views and hopes that they will be adopted and consistently advocated. Sincerely hope." Upon arrival, this matter was presented to your ministry on March 13 of this year, proposing five measures to relieve the market, requesting that they be adopted. In the second measure, it was mentioned that deeds and land practice certificates should be included as guarantees for bond reserves under the Central Bank. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance issued a reply with the number Qian Zi 5402, stating that it was feared that the proportion occupied would be too large, and if there was an emergency, it would be difficult to realize. The request should not be discussed. It can be seen that your ministry has carefully considered and planned comprehensively. However, the monetary system is now slightly different from the past. Therefore, if the proportion of land deeds is appropriately increased in the guarantee reserve, it does not seem to be a major obstacle. Based on the previous letter, we are preparing a document to submit to your ministry for review, requesting that it be adopted and implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e118">City Chamber of Commerce Announces the Process of Blocking the Sale of Liujiang Coal; The Chamber of Commerce Advocates Suing for Receiving Stolen Goods <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the report from the Liujiang Coal Mine Railway Company that the Zhongfu Company was promoting stolen coal from the Taiji Company, helping to commit crimes, and ordered a firm notice to all members that they must not sell the coal. If anyone is greedy for private gain and disregards the law, the Chamber of Commerce and the Coal Industry Association should impose severe sanctions. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce announced the handling of the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Process of Blocking the Sale of Stolen Coal from Taiji</p>
<p>On October 23 of this year, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Chinese-owned Liujiang Coal Mine Company, stating that the Taiji Company illegally occupied the mining area by force and requested that justice be upheld, and that all industries refuse to buy the above-mentioned mine coal. The Chamber of Commerce replied that since the Liujiang Company had filed a lawsuit according to law, the illegally mined and sold coal should be stopped. The key to this matter is entirely in the coal industry. The decision is to rotate the industry. Other industries mostly have less contact with the coal industry. The Liujiang Company has already sent letters to the coal and rotating industries, requesting their assistance. The handling has been effective. If the company believes that it is necessary to notify other industries, it can notify them of the names and addresses listed in the Chamber of Commerce membership directory.</p>
<p>Correspondence with Zhongfu Company</p>
<p>On December 9 of this year, the Liujiang Coal Mine Company sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Our company's mining area was previously illegally occupied by force by the Taiji Company, and the stored coal was transported to Shanghai for sale. On October 21 of this year, we sent a letter to your association requesting assistance. At the same time, our company sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association, refusing to buy and sell, and published a statement requesting attention from all sectors. No matter what name the Taiji Company uses to transport the coal to Shanghai, do not be fooled into promoting or selling it on their behalf to avoid disputes. Now it is seen in the newspaper that Hebei white coal is being sold under the name of Zhongfu Company. It is heard that the company is organized by your committee member, Mr. Ma Shaoquan. The so-called Hebei white coal is the Liujiang coal transported from our company's mining area to Shanghai and stored in Pudong. Our company believes that Mr. Ma's personality and status would not lead to this. However, since there are rumors, we would like to request that your association ask Mr. Ma to make a statement to dispel doubts." After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded it to Mr. Ma Shaoquan on the 9th, requesting him to investigate and reply. On December 10, Mr. Ma Shaoquan replied to the Chamber of Commerce, stating: "I received your letter, stating that the Liujiang Coal Mine Company and the Coal Industry Association have entrusted me to investigate the Zhongfu Company's sale of Hebei white coal, and that the organization is set up by me. What mine in Hebei is the coal from? Please investigate and reply. I have not organized any organization to sell Hebei white coal. However, I heard that my relative, Ma Zhaoye, has invested capital in the so-called Zhongfu Company. If the association wants to know the details of this matter, please inquire directly with Mr. Ma Zhaoye." The Chamber of Commerce then forwarded the letter to Ma Zhaoye of the Zhongfu Company, requesting him to reply with the details as soon as possible. Then, on the 11th, it received a letter from Ma Zhaoye of the Zhongfu Company, stating: "Regarding this case, our company received a letter of questioning from the Liujiang Company on the 8th of this month. We replied that our company has its own cargo owner to contact us for the sale of Hebei white coal. There is no need to inform us of the details you inquired about. Our company has not commented on the various disputes with others. The Hebei coal of our company is sold as an agent through legal procedures, just like the coal currently sold by the coal industry, such as Kishima, Matsuura, Miike, Fushun, Jilin, Kaohsiung, Kantou, etc. All these types of coal have been sold for a long time, and we have never heard of any objections from the industry. Therefore, there should be no discrimination against our company's sale of Hebei white coal." After receiving the letter, the City Chamber of Commerce forwarded the information to Liujiang Coal Mine Company and the Coal Industry Association.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: According to the Shanghai office of the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station, the station opposes the transfer of the Shengsi Islands to Zhejiang's jurisdiction. It telegraphed Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government the other day, stating: "Chairman Chen Jun of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, after investigating the Shengsi Islands, it should not be transferred to Zhejiang's jurisdiction. A telegram was previously sent to Chen listing the harms, requesting the Central Government to carefully consider and not relocate the jurisdiction. However, upon reading the newspaper, it was reported in the Zhenjiang telegram on the 17th that the Shengsi Islands of Chongming County, Jiangsu, have now received a notification from the Ministry of Interior that, for the convenience of management, it is necessary to transfer them to Zhejiang. A joint survey and handover will be conducted immediately. The Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department has consulted with Zhejiang to discuss sending personnel to conduct a joint survey to determine the date." When the news arrived, it was extremely shocking. The Shengsi Islands are the fishing center of our Jiangsu, the location of the field station, and the income from fish production is over 20 million yuan per year. Even in terms of administrative management, there is no inconvenience whatsoever. There is no reason to transfer it to Zhejiang's jurisdiction. We earnestly request that you argue on the basis of reason and do not allow it to be divided. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Sincerely, Yao Yongping, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station."</p>

<p>The Wuxi Station stevedores, because the Two-Railways Administration tendered for the contracting of the Wuxi Station loading and unloading work, and because the workers have historically suffered from the exploitation of contractors, have sent representatives to the Two-Railways Administration to petition for the cessation of the tender and to have the workers manage it themselves, following the precedent of the Shanghai North Station and Maigen Road Station.

<h3 id="e128">City Chamber of Commerce Letter Requesting: Correction of Illegal Measures by the Vehicle Committee; Substitute Writing of Debt Acknowledgements Infringing on Creditor Rights; Unauthorized Penalties Encroaching on Court Authority <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department, requesting correction of the illegal measures taken by the Vehicle Committee against vehicle owners. The letter stated:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Public Works Department:</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, we received a letter from the Manpower Rickshaw Industry Association stating that, concerning the special district rickshaw owners association, last year the Vehicle Committee proposed a rent reduction, which led to many disputes. The Public Works Department repeatedly convened meetings of rickshaw owner representatives with the Vehicle Committee on an equal basis. The result was an agreement to collect a daily rent of 85 cents in silver dollars, including the collection of mutual aid fees for rickshaw pullers. Other items such as rickshaw puller loans, rent arrears, and room fees were also allowed to be collected separately. Later, because rickshaw pullers did not have silver dollars to pay the rent, it was agreed to change the daily collection to 12 cents in small silver coins.</p>
<p>This November, after our country implemented the new currency system, the association immediately sent a letter to the branch office stating that due to the depreciation of silver dollars and the high price of small silver coins, the original rent of 85 cents in silver dollars should be changed to 10.6 cents in small silver coins per day, and no excess should be collected. This was immediately forwarded to all vehicle owners, with instructions to inform the lessees to comply.</p>
<p>However, a few unscrupulous rickshaw pullers, who had long-standing grudges against vehicle owners or lessees, often used this as an opportunity to make false accusations. Also, when vehicle owners or lessees sought to recover debts or collect room fees, it caused dissatisfaction, leading to hasty reports and false accusations of excessive collection. The Vehicle Committee did not investigate in detail, and anyone who made a complaint was summoned, and anyone summoned was penalized. Each penalty was 10 or 20 dollars, and more were extrapolated. If they refused to pay, their licenses would be confiscated for a month according to the number of penalties. If they were dissatisfied and applied for a review, they would inevitably be penalized double upon a second summons, regardless of whether we were right. Furthermore, if they were away on business during the summons period and could not attend on time, they would be considered disobedient and penalized double.</p>
<p>Even more shocking, in the case of Luan Lizhen, the lessee of vehicle owner Wang Shengji, because of collecting arrears each shift, a rickshaw puller reported excessive rent collection. When both parties were summoned to the scene, Luan Lizhen repeatedly clarified that the collected money was actually owed by the rickshaw puller, and the rickshaw puller also admitted owing money. It seemed that there should be no problem. However, the Vehicle Committee insisted on its own way, not only fining Wang Shengji 80 dollars but also forcing Luan Lizhen to sign eight debt acknowledgments for the rickshaw puller and give them to the rickshaw puller. The rickshaw puller owed Luan money at that time without any receipts. Now, even if it were repaid in full, there would be no need to sign a receipt. Moreover, the association did not receive a penny, yet it wrote in large characters, 'The owed money has been received in full.' Its illegal abuse of power is chilling.</p>
<p>Currently, vehicle owners are reporting repeatedly that the Vehicle Committee's penalties are even more severe than before, occurring several or dozens of times a day. It is estimated that the penalized vehicles account for almost one-tenth of the total. The reason is that the committee does not consider the truth and relies solely on the rickshaw pullers' one-sided statements, believing them to be accurate. Rickshaw pullers also believe that false accusations are not a crime, so they are becoming more frequent. Otherwise, how could the special district vehicle owners, who have eyes and ears, still dare to greedily overcharge a little rent in the midst of so many penalty sounds, risking heavy penalties or confiscation of their licenses for a month? Even a foolish vehicle owner would not be so foolish.</p>
<p>We believe that since the Public Works Department established the Vehicle Committee for the special district manpower rickshaw industry, the implementation of new regulations has become increasingly severe, and the suffering endured has been unbearable. Now, forcibly imposing penalties and compelling receipts, the oppression and destruction are limitless. The future of the manpower rickshaw industry is unimaginable. It is almost inevitable that they will go bankrupt.</p>
<p>We have always admired your association for leading the merchants and supporting various industries, so we should truthfully submit this to you for review and promptly forward it to the Public Works Department, asking them to correct the Vehicle Committee's various illegal actions, so that vehicle owners can avoid endless losses and prevent the expansion of disputes. Vehicle owners will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate. We are eagerly awaiting your response."</p>
<p>Attached was a photographic copy of a receipt.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the association pointed out that the Vehicle Committee listened only to one side and arbitrarily imposed penalties in various situations, as evidenced by the rickshaw puller's admission that he owed Luan Lizhen money. However, the Vehicle Committee actually wrote a receipt on their behalf, forcing the cancellation of the debt. With the Vehicle Committee's written receipt as evidence, it is not an empty accusation. This alone demonstrates that their daily work does indeed exceed the scope and that the legitimate interests of vehicle owners have not been considered. Moreover, according to the committee's authority, there is no reason to arbitrarily penalize vehicle owners. This encroaches on the authority of the court. The committee's actions raise serious legal issues.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have attached a photographic copy and respectfully request that your department severely reprimand the Vehicle Committee for all unreasonable measures taken in the past and ensure that they are corrected. This is our utmost hope.</p>

<p>Around 7 PM last night, five robbers suddenly broke into the home of Min Ren Kang Qiutao at No. 19, Dunhou Lane, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi. Kang was out and had not returned, leaving only Kang's wife, Cao, at home. The robbers showed handguns and silenced Ms. Cao, preventing her from making any noise. They then entered the inner room, rummaged through boxes and chests, and began to rob, taking a gold ring, three silver coins, a small diamond ring, a gold seal, a gold lock, silver lock belt, a woolen hat, a woolen coat, silk gauze pants, and other items. The robbers then left with their loot and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, Liu, the head of the Yemiao Police Station, immediately led patrol officer Shi Lantian and a large number of police officers to the scene, surrounded the area, and checked pedestrians. A member of the gang, Wang Gengen, was found hurrying along with the stolen goods and was arrested. The stolen gold lock, silver lock belt, and other items were found on his person. He was taken back for interrogation. Wang confessed that he was 19 years old and admitted to participating in the robbery with the other robbers who were still at large. Soon after, the victim also arrived at the station to identify the stolen goods. After ordering the return of the original stolen items, Wang was detained for further investigation and the arrest of the other robbers, who will be brought to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e130">After Settlement of the Owed Money from the China Commercial Bank: Lu Shaotang Surrenders to the Police Station for Interrogation; Public Prosecution for Embezzlement of Business Still Proceeds; Court Debate Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Sentence <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a real estate tycoon from Suzhou, had a close relationship with Chuan Xiao'an, the former president of the China Commercial Bank. Two years ago, he suggested to Chuan that a branch of the China Commercial Bank be established in Suzhou, and he recommended his son, Lu Bingsheng, as the general manager of the branch. Chuan accepted his suggestion but felt that Bingsheng was too young, so he appointed Lu to the position of general manager and gave Bingsheng the position of deputy manager to assist his father.</p>
<p>Lu originally founded the Guixing Real Estate Company at No. 207 Tianjin Road. After becoming the general manager of the Suzhou branch, he proposed to Chuan, with the latter's consent, to establish a communications office for the Suzhou branch within the Guixing Real Estate Company to facilitate the handling of public and private affairs. All banknotes paid to the branch by the head office were handled by the Guixing Company, and the Lu family used this financial power to operate their real estate business.</p>
<p>By the beginning of January this year, they had misappropriated 510,000 banknotes. In addition, the Guixing Company owed the China Commercial Bank more than 400,000. At this time, it was the end of the lunar year, and real estate prices in the market were falling. Lu's business was almost a complete failure. Therefore, Chuan Xiao'an demanded repayment from Lu Shaotang.</p>
<p>After gradually raising 680,000, Chuan not only cleared their current account debts but also used the remaining 170,000 to offset the misappropriated banknotes. However, there was still a shortage of 239,000 yuan. After pursuing repayment until May without success, Chuan Xiao'an reported the matter to the police station. Lu hid in advance, and his son, Bingsheng, was often detained and brought before the First Special District Local Court, which found him guilty of embezzlement of business and sentenced him to one year and six months in prison. Meanwhile, the court issued an arrest warrant for Lu Shaotang, who was at large.</p>
<p>However, Lu Bingsheng was dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment and is still appealing in the third instance. In recent months, Lu Shaotang has repeatedly asked relatives and friends to mediate with the China Commercial Bank. Now, the private prosecution regarding compensation for the missing banknotes has been resolved peacefully. The China Commercial Bank officially sent a letter to the police station a few days ago, stating that Lu had repaid the money. However, the police station stated that even if the private prosecution part of the case was settled, the public prosecution for embezzlement of business must still proceed according to the law and is not affected by the settlement.</p>
<p>In response to the letter from Lu's defense lawyer, Lu knew that he could not continue to live as a fugitive, so he surrendered to the police station at 5:45 AM yesterday. He was then sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Feng Shide opened the court for interrogation. Lu was already 68 years old, with white hair and beard. After the prosecuting lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police station presented the case, he began to defend himself at length, saying that the 239,000 yuan owed was actually the Guixing Company's debt to the China Commercial Bank and not the amount of missing banknotes. He claimed that when he gradually handed over 680,000 to Chuan Xiao'an, he had declared to Chuan that he would first repay the 510,000 yuan missing banknotes, and the remaining amount would be used to settle the accounts of current debtors, but Chuan had misunderstood and cleared the current accounts first. The remaining outstanding amount of 239,000 was treated as still as missing cash, but it has since been repaid. He also claimed that the accounts of Guixing Company, China Commercial Bank, and Suzhou branch were not fully compliant, all due to Chuan Xiao'an's excessive trust in him.</p>
<p>Judge Feng said that Lu Shaotang had indeed used the banknotes deposited by the China Commercial Bank in the Guixing Company for private purposes and could not escape the responsibility for embezzlement of business. He could not attempt to evade responsibility by compensating for it afterward. Therefore, after repeatedly questioning Lu, the defense lawyer and the police station lawyer debated successively. The China Commercial Bank also appointed lawyer E Sen to represent the bank in court, stating the process of the defendant's repayment and settlement. The court then declared the debate closed and adjourned until next Tuesday morning for sentencing. Lu Shaotang paid a bail of 50,000 yuan. Before the bail was secured, he was temporarily released into the custody of his defense lawyer.</p>
<p>Japanese Man Commits Suicide in Hongkou Park; Circumstances of Suicide Unfathomable</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Daily News, at 10:10 PM on the 18th, the watchman of Hongkou Park suddenly discovered a man who had taken poison next to a chair near the ball field. He immediately telegraphed the Dixwell Road Police Station. Soon after, the police station dispatched police officers to investigate. Because the man was unconscious and unable to speak, appearing to be a Japanese man of 27 or 28 years of age, they telegraphed the Japanese Consulate Police Department. The police department immediately drove an ambulance to the Fumin Hospital. The diagnosis revealed that he had taken a large amount of Gardemal sleeping pills, and his life was in critical condition and could not be saved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dixwell Road Police Station searched the park everywhere to understand the cause of the suicide, but found no evidence. However, in the bag he carried with him, they found an empty bottle that previously contained twenty sleeping pills, a complete collection of Rohua, three literary and religious books, and two name cards: "Muto Shoichi" and "Ito Hiko," as well as a letter. The letter was from Ito Takehiko to a woman, expressing concern for her illness. However, the text written on the letter paper had been completely smeared and was difficult to discern. But from this letter, it could be inferred that the matter was very complicated. Also, the markings on the Western-style clothes he wore showed "Takano Masanori." Therefore, the circumstances of the suicide are truly unfathomable.</p>

<p>—Plaintiff, a Portuguese National, Briefly Argues with Police Station Lawyer—</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a large advertisement appeared in the advertisement columns of major newspapers in this city, namely, Wang Pingsong (also known as Wang Bingzhong)'s notice offering a reward for the arrest of Xu Qizhong, the son of Xu Guannan. It is now known that Xu Qizhong had his actions monitored and his residence restricted by the Public Security Bureau in Hangzhou. They also notified the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives Yang Xinzheng and Western detective Haruo, who traveled to Hangzhou and escorted Xu to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division Eight of the First Special Court, where he was charged with fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law and forgery of documents under Article 210 of the same law.</p>
<p>Both the plaintiff and the defendant hired lawyers to attend court. According to police station lawyer Zhang Dayin, who rose to present the case, on October 16, the victim Wang Bingzhong reported to the police station that the defendant Xu Qizhong had borrowed 40,000 yuan from him on May 22nd and signed an IOU at his office at No. 28, Fuming Village, 424 Foch Road. At the time, in addition to the original defendant, there were also guarantors Shen Shouheng and lawyers Shen Yiqian and Shen Boxiong signing the IOU on site.</p>
<p>The defendant used three land deeds as collateral (two on Hongqiao Road, one on Yangshupu Road), stating that the mortgage period was one year and six months, with interest starting at 1.5% per month. At the time, Wang felt that these collaterals were not enough, so the defendant promised to provide an additional 100,000 yuan in shares of the Nanshi Water and Electricity Company in the future. Wang then issued eight checks from the Shanghai Bank, each worth 5,000 yuan, dated May 22. According to Wang, the money had already been withdrawn from the bank by the defendant.</p>
<p>Later, Wang became suspicious of the land deeds that Xu had provided and investigated with the Land Bureau. According to Director Jin Liren's instructions, all three land deeds were forgeries. Wang then pursued the guarantor Shen Shouheng, and entrusted lawyer Chen to send a letter to the defendant, setting a deadline for returning the money. Since there was no reply, Wang offered a reward and advertised in the newspaper for Xu's arrest. The Hangzhou Public Security Bureau found out about Xu's whereabouts and restricted the defendant's residence, notifying the police station, which escorted Xu to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>However, according to the defendant's statement at the police station, it was true that he borrowed money from the plaintiff, but he only received 3,220 yuan, not 40,000 yuan. The IOU was signed because he was in urgent need. The guarantor Shen Shouheng was a friend of Wang Bingzhong. The police station had not investigated the case in detail, so they requested that the charges be changed.</p>
<p>Next, Wang Bingzhong, 32 years old, Portuguese, born in Macau, residing at No. 28 Fuming Village, Foch Road, stated that he lent the defendant 40,000 yuan on September 22 and had the defendant sign an IOU in his own handwriting, witnessed and signed by the guarantor Shen Shouheng and two lawyers. The defendant used three land deeds as collateral. At the time, I also asked for additional collateral. The defendant agreed to provide additional collateral in the form of shares of the water company and grain warrants. I then issued eight Shanghai Bank checks, totaling 40,000 yuan, and the defendant signed and sealed the back of the checks to withdraw the money. Later, the defendant did not send the additional collateral, so I sent a letter to urge him.</p>
<p>He replied that he could not do so because his father refused to hand them over. I became suspicious of the previously delivered land deeds and sent them to the Land Bureau for investigation, which confirmed that they were forgeries. Later, the defendant suddenly disappeared. I then posted an advertisement for his arrest.</p>
<p>Judge Liu then questioned him as to how much he had on deposit at the Shanghai Bank when the checks were issued, and when the money for the checks was withdrawn. Wang refused to answer and was stubborn in his statement, leading to an argument with the police station lawyer. Judge Liu then instructed Wang that this was a Chinese court, and he should maintain order in the courtroom. Since he was the victim, he should answer the questions as fully as possible during the evidence investigation so that the case could be clarified. Wang complied.</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant Xu Qizhong stated that he was introduced to Wang by Shen Shouheng. Since March of this year, he had borrowed a total of more than 1,000 yuan from Wang. On May 22, he borrowed more than 1,700 yuan from Wang at Wang's home in Fuming Village, Foch Road.</p>
<p>At that time, there were only Wang, Shen, and myself. At the time, Wang and others used some means to ask me to sign a pre-written IOU before handing me a check for 1,700 yuan from Shanghai Bank, which I went to withdraw. Therefore, up to the time of signing the IOU, I had only received a total of 3,220 yuan in loans and nothing about 40,000 yuan. I was coerced into signing the IOU for 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>One of the lawyers came out of another room afterward and signed on the IOU. I do not know about the eight Shanghai Bank checks presented by the plaintiff. All three land deeds also belonged to Wang himself, who told me to admit that they were mine. After signing, Shen Shouheng and I went out together in a car. At the time, I thought that Wang's methods were like kidnapping, and I wanted to report it to the police station, but Shen threatened me, so I did not dare to report it. Also, the reply letter presented by Wang was also written by Wang when the IOU was signed, with the dates reversed to be my reply letter. All these methods were pre-planned. Later, I suddenly received a letter from lawyer Chen, setting a deadline of 24 hours for a reply. I was frightened and went to Hangzhou. I am only 22 years old and have limited knowledge, so I was fooled. Last year, at the end of the year, I also borrowed 5,000 yuan from Wang, and Wang requested the court to mediate, suing for 15,000 yuan. At that time, I did not appear in court, and Shen Shouheng appointed a lawyer to represent me in court, admitting 25,000 yuan. After the mediation was successful, it was repaid.</p>
<p>Judge Liu reviewed the statements and instructed Xu to post a bail of 40,000 yuan. The case was rescheduled for further hearing next Saturday.</p>

<p>After Li Jingfang died in Dalian, his concubine, Li Wu, claimed that Li's son, Guo Tao, grandson, Jia Ji, Jia Xing, and Zhou Mengwen, the manager of the Wuhu Liji Steamboat Company, jointly embezzled 23,000 yuan of the old-age pension that her husband had given her. She hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation of embezzlement and breach of trust against Li and others in the First Special District Local Court, and filed an accompanying civil lawsuit, requesting that the defendants be ordered to compensate the money. After Judge Liu Yugui opened the court several times and summoned the plaintiff, defendants, and witnesses for investigation, the trial concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the verdict was announced. The plaintiff did not arrive at the time, and only Li Jiaji and Zhou Mengwen appeared for the defendants. Judge Liu then announced the judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit and finding all defendants not guilty.</p>

<p>Zhuang Jimeng, the owner of the Zhuangyuan Da Zao Workshop in Hongkou, married Zhang Yuexing, a Ningbo woman, on February 14, 1931. They have four children, boys and girls, but the relationship between the couple is not harmonious. In March of last year, Zhuang suddenly met Minghua Lao Jiu (also known as Feng Minghua), a famous prostitute, and soon rented a house to live together. In the spring of this year, Zhang Yuexing found out and intervened. As a result, Zhuang paid 4,000 gold to Feng Minghua to settle the debt and cut off the relationship as a condition. Feng then resumed her career as a prostitute. Not long after, Zhuang and Feng rekindled their love and rented No. 27 Duofu Lane, Foch Road, as a place to hide their mistress. Now, Feng Minghua is seven months pregnant, which was secretly detected by Zhang Yuexing on the 14th of this month. She reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station, and Chinese detective Wang Yongjun arrested Zhuang and Feng and sent them to the First Special District Court. Police Station lawyer Qian Xunjiu charged them with adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. After the interrogation was concluded, Zhuang and Feng were each released on bail of 300 yuan to await sentencing. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Criminal Division Two and announced the judgment. Zhuang Jimeng and Feng Minghua arrived in court with their defense lawyer Yu Xiangqin to await sentencing. Judge Dai then read out the main text, sentencing Zhuang Jimeng to three months of imprisonment for adultery with a spouse, and sentencing Feng Minghua to three months of imprisonment for illicit intercourse, both with a three-year suspension of sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e135">After the Death of Gao Yunsun's Eldest Son, a Woman Sues, Requesting Confirmation of Granddaughter, Claiming to Be Born by Gao's Son <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Gao Yunsun, a native of this county and head of the accounting department of the Zhengming Bank on Ningbo Road, is over sixty years old and has a modest family fortune. His eldest son, Gao Yuelun, worked at the Mccarley Bank. On October 3 of this year, his stomach burst, and medical treatment was ineffective, so he died. Recently, a local woman, Qian Meifen (32 years old, residing at No. 5 Zhaoqing Lane, Chengdu Road), claiming to be Yuelun's wife and that she had two daughters, the eldest daughter, Mei Jun, who is eight years old, and the youngest daughter, Mei Lin, who is only one year old and still in swaddling clothes, requested Gao Yunsun to recognize them. Gao refused, so she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Gao, requesting confirmation that Mei Jun and Mei Lin were his granddaughters.</p>
<p>The reason given was that after the plaintiff married Gao Yuelun, she gave birth to two daughters. When the defendant's wife was alive, she loved the eldest daughter Mei Jun very much, and the defendant often took her home. When Mei Jun was two years old, the aunt (i.e., the defendant's wife) died. This October, her husband Yuelun also died. The defendant listened to the words of his relatives and cut off the plaintiff's support. She sent a lawyer's letter to question him, but he did not recognize the plaintiff's right to raise the two daughters, etc. Because she was unable to pay the litigation fees, she temporarily reserved the right to do so, and first filed this lawsuit for confirmation, requesting confirmation that Gao Mei Jun and Gao Mei Lin are the defendant's granddaughters, etc.</p>
<p>The court granted the request. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi opened the Civil Division Thirteen and summoned the defendant Gao Yunsun, who hired lawyer Zhang Ji to attend court. According to his defense, his son Yuelun had never taken a concubine outside, so how could there be children? Even if there was a concubine affair, it must be legally recognized before any kinship would be established. Therefore, he completely denied what the plaintiff said and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. After Judge Huang questioned him, the case was adjourned for another hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Accusation of a Rebellious Son Beating His Mother; His Speech Incoherent, Seeming to Have a Mental Illness <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Madam Gu Qian, a local old woman, residing at No. 20, Lane 1177, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, in her own house, is 81 years old this year, a Catholic, and quite wealthy. She has an only son, named Gu Hongxiang, also known as Fengxiang, who is 37 years old this year. He does not engage in proper work and is solely occupied with wandering about outside, either staying in inns or living in grand hotels, appearing to suffer from a mental illness. He spends his days squandering the ancestral property, often extorting money from his mother for his use. When his wishes are not fulfilled, he resorts to violence, doing all sorts of things. The day before yesterday (the 17th), at about 10 a.m., Gu Hongxiang again returned home to demand 10,000 yuan from his mother, as well as the land price receipts and letters for the land on Rue Lupan, Datok Fang, which the Public Works Department had acquired for road construction. Madam Qian refused to agree, and Hongxiang immediately became violent, slapping his old mother's face twice. After the assault, he turned and left. Madam Qian, considering her rebellious son's unlawful behavior and frequent assaults on his elders, feared the consequences and immediately reported the matter to the Beidang Road French Police Station, requesting an investigation. Detective Liu Kunbao went to arrest Gu Hongxiang, and the next day, he was sent to the Special Second Court, where Judge Qiu heard the case in the eighth civil chamber. The representative of the Police Department, lawyer Fei Xizhen, presented the case, requesting that it be tried according to Articles 280 and 281 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Madam Gu Qian, recounted the defendant's violent acts, stating that over the past two years, more than 20,000 yuan had been spent, as evidenced by account books, which were submitted for inspection. Lawyer Zhu Yisheng, representing her, further described the defendant's past violent acts. When questioned, the defendant, Gu Hongxiang, stated that all the ancestral property of the people was managed by his mother, who gave him 300 yuan per month for his use. However, that was not enough for the people to use, and it would be best if she gave him 500 yuan, or even 5,000 yuan, each month. The judge asked what his monthly expenses were that required such a large sum. Gu Hongxiang replied that his expenses were very large, including the expenses of the whole world and the whole of China, his speech incoherent. The court adjourned the hearing to the 21st. The defendant was remanded in custody, and the plaintiff, Madam Gu Qian, was instructed to submit to the French medical examiner's office for examination of her injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e137">British Police Court Continues Hearing of Injury Case of Two British Detectives <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The "Great America Evening News" reports that Western Police Head Peter of the Jiading Road Police Station and probationary Police Head Jute are accused of throwing beggar Ma Debiao into the Hongkou creek on December 1st, causing bodily harm, and Ma subsequently died in the hospital. This morning (the 19th), the British Consular Police Court resumed the trial. The defendant's lawyer, Mr. Lykes, refuted the testimony of Du, the chauffeur (Chinese Police No. 3067) who drove the two detectives to Xinji creek Road to find the beggar and later saw the two detectives throw him into the Hongkou creek, stating that the words and meaning were different from those hand-copied by Western Patrol Officer Bennett. Then, a certain peddler Shen Jinsheng, who had helped to rescue Ma Debiao from the water, was called to testify. According to the peddler, he had been playing mahjong and eating at his home after his evening work, around 3 a.m. He was just about to take off his clothes to go to bed when he suddenly heard cries for help. He went downstairs to the street and saw his neighbor, Shen Jinsheng, standing by the river. Shen Jinsheng could not pull up a person who had fallen into the water and called him for help. The two of them then rescued the person to the shore. Soon after, a Chinese policeman arrived at the scene, then he questioned the two foreigners who had been standing by the river, dressed in uniform and shining a flashlight. The defendant's lawyer, Mr. Lee, cross-examined them about their actions in great detail. Mr. Lee asked why he went to the vegetable market so early in the morning. Shen replied that some people go to the Sixteen Pups of Xiaodongmen to sell vegetables as early as 2 a.m. Mr. Lee also said that the two foreigners did not have a flashlight at the time. Shen replied, "Why should I lie?" Shen also stated that he saw the two foreigners leave in a car from inside the door, and he went out to the back of the car and saw the car's license plate number. At that point, the judge announced that the court was adjourned until 10 a.m. the next morning.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Yang Qingchang, Son of Former Zhejiang Military Governor Yang Shande, Accused of Breach of Contract; Plaintiffs are Yang Fuchen and Others, Representatives of the Clan, Accusing Him of Failing to Compile the Clan Genealogy and Fulfill the Contract <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The late former Zhejiang Military Governor Yang Shande had a close friendship with Jewish millionaire Silas Aaron Hardoon, the owner of Aili Garden. Therefore, he entrusted his youngest son, Qingchang, to be raised in his garden, making Hardoon and Madame Luo Jialing his adoptive parents and guardians. Later, after Yang died, Yang's eldest son, Qingwei (style name Jingru), had a lawsuit with Qingchang over the division of the inheritance. At that time, Qingchang was still a child, so Hardoon, as his guardian, reached a settlement with Qingzheng to end the lawsuit. Not long after, Qingwei also passed away without any offspring, so his nephew, Yang Weizu, inherited his estate. Although Qingchang was dissatisfied, he suppressed his feelings. Now, Qingchang is 22 years old and has been cohabitating with Hardoon's adopted daughter, Ms. Chen, at No. 3, Ci Huili, Seymour Road, and has already had a child, but has not yet gone through the marriage formalities, which has caused considerable criticism from the Yang clan in his native Anqing. In April last year, the Yang clan discussed compiling the clan genealogy, and made quite critical remarks about Qingchang's marriage and childbirth. When Qingchang heard about this, he immediately sought to remedy the situation. He appointed clan representatives Yang Fuchen, Yang Yiqi, and Yang Xianbo, who came to Shanghai from Anhui, to negotiate. After discussions, the representatives were to find a way to complete the marriage formalities between Yang and Ms. Chen, so that the name of his child could also be included in the clan genealogy, and Qingchang would bear all the costs of compiling the genealogy and serve as the highest authority in charge of the compilation. Both parties immediately signed a contract as evidence. Later, Qingchang wanted to use the clan's influence to overturn the previous case in which Yang Weizu had inherited his brother Qingzheng's estate, and even wanted to recover a portion of the property that Qingzheng had obtained in the lawsuit with him, so he entered into another cooperation agreement with Yang Fuchen and the other two, entrusting Yang Fuchen and others to handle three matters: 1. Correcting Yang Weizu's illegal inheritance and management of property from Yang Qingzheng. 2. Revoking Hardoon's unfavorable promises made in court on behalf of Qingchang as his guardian. 3. Seeking compensation from Qingzheng's estate for the 1,000 shares of the Nanyang Company that Qingzheng had illegally occupied in Qingchang's name. If all three matters were successful, the benefits Qingchang would receive would be more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, in the cooperation agreement, the rights to be obtained by Yang Fuchen and the other two were 10% of the future proceeds to be paid by Qingchang as remuneration, and another 10% to be transferred to the Yang Sizhitang clan as a public benefit. In addition, all expenses for the three representatives' travel to Shanghai and to and from Anhui, Shanghai, and Hangzhou would be provided by Qingchang, and the agreement stipulated that neither party could breach the contract halfway, or they would have to compensate for the losses. Unexpectedly, since the signing of the agreement, Yang Qingchang has neither borne the costs of compiling the genealogy nor assumed the highest position, allowing the genealogy work to be abandoned halfway. As for the three matters stipulated in the other agreement, he has also delayed them indefinitely without any intention of proceeding. Therefore, Yang Fuchen and the others believe that Qingchang has breached the contract and have hired lawyer Li Lin to file a lawsuit against Yang Qingchang in the First Special District Local Court for breach of contract, requesting a judgment ordering him to compensate for actual losses of 3,949.91 yuan and to bear the litigation costs. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Hui summoned them, and the defendant also hired a lawyer to represent him. After the court investigated the case, it was ordered that Yang Qingchang be summoned to court for further questioning on a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Breaking a Lamp at a Beef Stall; Shaoxing Opera Troupe Stages an All-Out Brawl; Gangsters Wield Knives and Axes to Take Advantage of the Situation and Avenge Personal Grudges; Crown Prince Falls to the Ground Injured, "Willow Fate" Performance Suspended <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Taipinglou Teahouse, located at No. 60, Caishi Road, French Concession, is owned by Zhang Jinquan from Pudong. It used to also have a Tanhuang theater, but recently invited a Shaoxing troupe to perform Yue Opera, commonly known as "Didu Ban Shaoxing Opera." The troupe leader, Lou Gaofeng, is 29 years old and plays the role of a "xusheng" (bearded male character). Because of his superb artistry, he has a position similar to that of Tan Xinpei in the Peking Opera world. As a result, since the performance began, the business has been quite prosperous. Today, the contract expires, and they will move to the North City to perform. At 8:30 p.m. on the 13th of this month, Lou Gaofeng ordered his 12-year-old apprentice, the girl Zhou Lingzhi, to go to the</p>
<p>beef stall set up by Zhu Rongkui at the intersection of Route Lafayette, south of the Taipinglou,</p>
<p>to buy beef. Lingzhi obeyed the order and went to buy the beef. Unexpectedly, when she arrived next to the beef stall, she accidentally knocked over and broke the kerosene lamp that was lit on the stall. The stall owner, Zhu Yingkui, said to Lingzhi, "This lamp cost one yuan when it was originally bought from overseas, and now you must compensate for the lamp price of eight jiao." Lingzhi replied that she didn't have any money on her and would go and call her master to acknowledge the compensation. Zhu Rongkui then took the broken kerosene lamp with Lingzhi to the Taipinglou Teahouse to ask her master for compensation. When they arrived at the entrance, Lingzhi called her master, Lou Gaofeng, to come outside and</p>
<p>negotiate compensation</p>
<p>with the beef stall owner Zhu Rongkui. At that time, Lou Gaofeng, because Zhu had demanded eight jiao in compensation, immediately agreed to compensate half a yuan, four jiao. At that time, Zhu still thought he was losing too much, and was still hesitating. Lou Gaofeng, because he was playing the crown prince in the Yue Opera "Willow Fate" that night, was about to go on stage, and time was short, so he couldn't talk for a long time. He told Zhu to wait for him to finish singing and come off stage before discussing it further. Without waiting for Zhu's reply, he turned and went inside. Unexpectedly, at that moment, Wang Peisheng, a local gangster in the area (20 years old, from Changzhou, living at No. 1, Weiyuanli, near Route Lafayette), found out that Lou Gaofeng</p>
<p>had not greeted</p>
<p>them, the local gangsters, before he started singing at the Taipinglou, and held a grudge. Now seeing that his apprentice had caused trouble, he could take this opportunity to get revenge and extort money to vent his anger. So he snatched the broken kerosene lamp from Zhu Rongkui's hand and went straight into the backstage of the Taiping Teahouse to find Lou Gaofeng to argue and demand compensation. Lou said that this was a trivial matter, what did it have to do with him, and severely rebuked him and ordered him to be driven out. Wang was enraged and added fuel to the fire. He went outside for no more than five minutes and gathered more than a dozen of his accomplices, Tang Xiaokai, Liu Xiaokun, etc., each armed with axes, iron rods, etc., and rushed to the Taipinglou to seek revenge on Lou Gaofeng. At that time, Lou Gaofeng, playing</p>
<p>the crown prince in "Willow Fate",</p>
<p>had just followed the other actors and the extras playing civil and military officials out of the stage door from the stage, and was about to start singing. Wang Peisheng and several other troublemakers jumped onto the stage and blew Lou's head with axes. Fortunately, Lou was wearing a stage helmet (made of copper, etc.) and quickly dodged. A piece of the helmet corner had been chopped off, and the axe had already been slammed into the door panel. Lou had already dodged into the backstage, and Wang and others followed in, cutting Lou twice on the back with an axe. Then they dispersed and fled with a roar. Lou fell to the ground, and the play also</p>
<p>stopped performing due to the riot.</p>
<p>His companions reported the incident to the police station, and detectives rushed to the scene, but the culprits had already fled without a trace. The injured person was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, the owner of the Taipinglou, Zhang Jinquan, because Lou's opera troupe had been profitable since it started performing, but refused to stay when the contract expired, harbored a grudge. At the time of the incident, he did not come out to stop them, allowing the thugs to cause trouble. The police station sent detectives to summon Zhang and the beef stall owner to the police station for questioning. At the same time, they ordered detectives to investigate and arrest the criminals. However, after the incident, all the criminals scattered and hid. On the morning of the 18th, Detective Sui Wenzhi learned that the ringleader, Wang Peisheng,</p>
<p>was hiding in his home.</p>
<p>So he went to the address with detectives Yang Weishan and others to arrest him. When they arrived, Wang was hiding in the room. His wife came out to answer, saying that Wang was not at home. The detectives then used a trick to lure him, pretending to be sent by Little Ningbo, saying that they had something to ask Wang to help with. Wang heard the voice in the room and thought that a business opportunity had come, so he could not miss it, so he came out to greet them. The detectives then arrested him and took him to the police station. Under questioning, Wang admitted that he had gathered a gang and injured people with an axe, but although he held an axe, his hand was weak and he did not cut anyone, but it was Liu Xiaokun, who was on the run,</p>
<p>who cut Lou.</p>
<p>The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Chamber of the Special Second Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the Police Department presented the case, stating that the defendant had been arrested for the crime of injury, the victim was being treated in the hospital, and his injuries were very serious. The Police Department still needed to investigate and arrest the fleeing criminals, and requested an extension. Judge Sun Pengham approved the request after questioning the defendant Wang Peisheng. Wang's statements were evasive. The court ruled that the case would be adjourned and reinvestigated before another hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Madame Maurice Talks About Her Travels; Not for Exploration But to Broaden Her Horizons; A Short Rest Before Three More Years <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that Madame Maurice from New York City loves to travel. In the past seven years, she has traveled to various countries and experienced many dangerous situations. She recently arrived in Shanghai and is staying at the Cathay Hotel. She will travel north to visit the old capital on Saturday and Sunday. Madame Maurice is light in stature and gentle in demeanor, and one would never believe that she is an explorer, let alone that she gets up at 3 a.m. every morning and walks 23 miles a day for weeks on end. Nor would one believe that she has ventured deep into Tibet and traveled through the remote, uninhabited parts of the western Himalayas in India, riding in an ox cart during the day and sleeping in a tent at night, for four months on end. Moreover, her travels are all done alone, with only local people as guides. After enjoying a year of civilized life, Madame Maurice plans to return to uninhabited areas and continue her travels. Madame Maurice's travels are not for exploration, but merely to broaden her horizons. She has been traveling since childhood. In 1929, she visited India and, while viewing the high mountains, had the idea of following in the footsteps of Marco Polo. Two years later, she set off from London, passing through Darjeeling and entering Tibet, but at a point three stations away from Lhasa, Tibetan officials forced her to turn back. This time, she has been traveling for 18 months. She initially planned to cross Persia with a camel train, but the Persian government did not allow her to travel outside of the motor roads. According to Madame Maurice, Persia's motor roads are 6,000 miles long and have been built in recent years, with police strictly guarding them. The Persian government is very suspicious of travelers, especially women traveling alone in remote areas, fearing that they might secretly carry away recently excavated treasures. Madame Maurice, finding that she was being watched wherever she went, left Persia and traveled to Java, Bali, and Sumatra, and then returned to India. In India, Madame Maurice went through many setbacks before obtaining a travel permit. Then she went to various parts rarely visited by humans. Her horses often walked for several days to find grass and fodder, for four months on end. The journey was full of hardships. When she reached a place north of Lahore, she was stopped by the authorities and turned back to Kashmir. After ten days, she saw Tangchenjunga Mountain and Everest Mountain, and admired their magnificent mountain peaks. During this trip, she never went below 16,000 feet for two weeks, but because it was her first time, her strength was exhausted, and she wanted to collapse and lie down. The men who accompanied her felt lazy and tired, because at this altitude, it was not easy to boil water and cook food. Then she traveled about 500 miles over the Himalayas and walked about 400 miles. Madame Maurice said that traveling in the uninhabited parts of the world is like entering a world of floods, and the most beautiful scenery is the mountain colors at sunset.

<h3 id="e147">Increasing Number of Visitors to Yixing's Two Caves <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanjuan and Gengsang Caves in Yixing are the foremost historical sites in Jiangsu Province. However, due to a lack of artificial management in the past, they have been submerged in obscurity for many years. Recently, thanks to the painstaking efforts of Mr. Chu Nanqiang, a gentleman from Yixing, over the past fifteen years, the caves have been carefully repaired, and their appearance has been completely renewed, gradually attracting the attention of the world. The automobile road now leads directly to the cave entrance, making access much more convenient than in the past. In recent days, visitors have been flocking to the caves in an endless stream, which can be described as a grand event. A reporter, in order to investigate the current situation of the two caves and the transportation conditions, took the special express train from the North Station of Shanghai at 8:00 yesterday morning and arrived in Wuxi at 10:39 (since the 21st of this month, the special express train between Shanghai and Wuxi can be shortened by another 22 minutes). The reporter then hired a car and arrived at Shanjuan Cave at 12:30, finding it deep and magnificent, beyond description. Colorful lanterns are hung throughout the cave, imbuing the solemn atmosphere with a touch of ethereal beauty, instantly giving people a feeling of "a separate world, not of this realm." The floors of each cave have recently been paved with cement, and a deep well, with about a hundred steps, has been dug between the middle and lower caves to facilitate ascending and descending. At the entrance to the lower cave valley, waterfalls and flying springs scatter like beads, making for an extremely pure and secluded environment. The waterways in the rear cave are winding and picturesque, and one can navigate them by boat. After leaving the cave, the reporter crossed the mountain and returned to the front of the Shanjuan Hall, then drove to Gengsang Cave. Inside the cave, countless stalactites hang down like tassels, strangely beautiful and deeply secluded, creating an atmosphere of immense grandeur, befitting the name of an oriental scenic spot. The Shan-Geng Road, which runs from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to the two caves, has now been repaved with crushed stone, making it flat, smooth, and extremely sturdy. Even in the event of rain or snow, there is no fear of collapse. The daily progress of transportation in the area is evident from this. Both caves have simple folk restaurants that serve palatable food at low prices, making them especially convenient for travelers. People from Shanghai who go to the caves to see their wonders are coming in droves, mostly taking the 8:00 AM special express train from Shanghai North Station, arriving in Wuxi at 10:17, and then hiring a local car to travel to the two caves for a pleasant visit. They then take the 8:34 PM special express train back to Shanghai on the same day. It is said that if a group of five or six people travel together, the cost can be greatly reduced, with food and transportation costing only about ten yuan per person.</p>

<p>The well-known German steel factory, Krupp Isteg steel, has a novel and excellent product for steel bars used in reinforced concrete, which has been on the market for a long time, called Krupp Isteg steel bars. Its yield point is at least 50% higher than ordinary mild steel bars, so the safe tensile force used can also be at least 50% higher, while remaining completely safe and without any drawbacks. Therefore, by using Krupp Isteg steel bars, only two-thirds the weight of ordinary mild steel bars is needed, but the price is slightly higher than ordinary mild steel bars. However, because the weight is greatly reduced, costs can be saved by at least 15% to 20%. The amount of Krupp Isteg steel bars used is increasing daily in Europe, and it will surely become popular in China in the future, because no construction company or owner would be unwilling to adopt them in order to save 20% of the cost of steel bars used in reinforced concrete. Krupp Isteg steel bars have been tested and approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council, which acknowledged that their safe tensile force is 50% greater than ordinary mild steel bars. The exclusive agent for Krupp Isteg steel bars in China is Liki Yangxing, located at 220 Sichuan Road in Shanghai. For detailed information about this novel steel bar, please inquire at the Yangxing.</p>

The products of China Cement Company are mostly sold in large commercial ports such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Because Qixin Cement Company does not have branches or distributors in major commercial ports across the country, its sales range is wider, almost all over the country. According to investigations, the Shanghai general wholesale office of the company sells about 700,000 barrels to Jiangsu and Fujian each year, mainly in this port; the Tianjin general office sells 500,000 barrels to Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi each year; the Hankou general wholesale office sells 200,000 barrels to Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei each year; the Fengtian general wholesale office sells 200,000 barrels to the three northeastern provinces each year, but since the September 18th Incident, the northeast market has been seized, and the North China region has also been affected by the dumping of Japanese goods, and sales have gradually become sluggish.</p>
<p>As for the sales volume this year, the first half of the year was not bad, but since the second half of the year, as the market has become more and more depressed, sales have declined daily, so the sales volume has decreased month by month. According to investigations, Shanghai Cement Company sold an average of 6 million kilograms per month in the first half of the year, and in the past three months, the average may be less than 5 million kilograms. China Cement Company's average monthly sales volume in the first half of the year was 10 million kilograms, and since the second half of the year, the average monthly sales volume has been only 8.9 million kilograms.</p>
<p>(IX) Business Overview</p>
<p>The business situation of Chinese-owned factories was the best in 1932, when the construction industry in this port was booming and the market price was firm and high, with only 6 corners of consolidated tax levied per barrel. Since the end of 1932, the consolidated tax has been changed to 1 yuan and 2 corners per barrel, and the cost has increased. At the same time, imports of foreign goods have increased sharply and prices have been lowered for dumping, and the sales of domestically produced cement have been hindered, and business has declined daily. Until July 1934, the government increased import tariffs (it is estimated that the import tax for every 100 kilograms of cement increased to 8 corners and 3 cents of customs gold), and imports of foreign goods suddenly decreased. The demand for domestically produced cement gradually increased, and the supply was not sufficient. The business of each factory has improved. In the most recent months of this year, due to the depressed market, the business of each factory has also trended downwards.</p>
<p>The market price for cement sales is uniform. The above three factories have jointly organized the Domestic Cement Business Office at 33 Sichuan Road, Shanghai, specializing in cement trading, and have agreed on the market price. Each factory sends staff to be stationed at the office all the time, so that customers can contact them. All wholesale transactions in this port are directly ordered from the business office or the factory, and the payment is settled at that time or paid at the end of the month in installments. As for retail purchases, contact the hardware store. If you want to set up a management office in another port, you can sign a contract with the factory, but you must have a reputable business shop guarantee or pay a certain amount of deposit. The management office handles goods from the company, based on the principle that it does not exceed the deposit paid, and the payment is settled on a monthly basis. All tariffs and transportation costs are borne by the management office; in addition to giving special discounts, the company also rewards with considerable commissions.</p>
<p>(X) Recent Market Price</p>
<p>Recently, due to the cold market and the stagnation of construction, the products of each factory have formed a situation of oversupply, and the market price has frequently trended downwards. According to investigations, the price of the Elephant brand produced in Shanghai was still around 7 yuan per barrel in February of this year (including consolidated tax). Until recently, it has plummeted by more than 1 yuan, and it is now only sold for between 5 yuan and 78 corners.</p>
<p>The price of China's Taishan brand is similar to that of Shanghai, and it has also fallen across the board.</p>
<p>As for the price of Qixin's Horse brand, it is currently sold for about 6 yuan and 6 corners per barrel, including consolidated tax, and each bag is sold for about 2 yuan, both of which are lower than before.</p>
<p>It is said that recently, in view of the rising raw material prices and the interruption of foreign goods sources after the currency system reform, each company has increased the price of cement by 1 yuan and 3 corners per barrel since this month. (The End)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau has hired 39 famous teachers from various major middle schools in the city, including Zhang Yi, Shao Jialin, and Tu Jimei, to form a committee to compile teaching progress schedules for middle school subjects. The committee is divided into seven groups, and Chen Ruizhi, the director of studies at Wuben Girls' Middle School, has been hired as secretary. The committee members in each group met separately at the beginning of the month to discuss the drafting steps and assign tasks. With the exception of the biology group, all groups have begun drafting. The initial drafts are expected to be completed by mid-January of next year. As the progress schedules must be based on the textbooks approved by major publishing houses to ensure that they are suitable for teachers to use, letters have been sent to major publishing houses requesting them to submit textbooks in various subjects. Commercial Press, China Press, and others have already submitted their textbooks. As the progress schedules also include a section for supplementary materials, the committee is currently investigating books about Shanghai to collect materials for the civic history and geography groups to use as reference.</p>
<p>In addition, the secretary of the committee, Chen Duanzhi, has informed the members of the biology group, which had not yet been assigned tasks due to the scattered locations of the members, that they should meet quickly and begin drafting as soon as possible in order to ensure that all subjects can be completed on time.</p>

<p>Chinese people, except for those from Hunan, consider a baby to be one year old at birth and increase their age by one year with each New Year. Therefore, a baby born on New Year's Eve is considered to be two years old on New Year's Day of the following year. This method of calculating age differs from the actual age by as much as one to two years. It is generally considered that this error is not important, but in sciences such as medicine, hygiene, human society, education, and psychology, it is crucial to calculate and study based on the actual age. Therefore, in recent years, many Chinese scientists have been calculating actual age from the nominal age. The various methods used include the following:</p>
<p>(1) Hsu's Sliding Scale and Calculation Table for Actual Age</p>
<p>Professor Hsu Wen-sheng of Peking Union Medical College published a method for calculating actual age using a sliding scale in the Chinese Medical Journal in 1923. The scale is divided into three rows, A, B, and C. A represents the Gregorian calendar month, B represents the lunar calendar month, with the lunar and Gregorian calendars always differing by one month, and C represents the distance in months. A slider is attached to the top, which can be moved left and right to align with the month to be examined. When used, the slider is aligned with row A, which represents the month of measurement. When aligned with row B, it represents the month of birth of the child. Then, the distance between the alignment points of rows A and B is found on row C, and the actual age of the child is calculated from this distance. Four years later, Hsu and Pan created an actual age calculation table based on the previous method and published it in the same journal. The table lists the number of years and months to be subtracted from the nominal age. When calculating, simply look up the intersection of the row for the lunar birth month and the column for the Gregorian calculation month, and subtract the number listed at that intersection from the nominal age to obtain the actual age.</p>
<p>(2) Actual Age Calculation Table Issued by the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The method for calculating actual age issued by the Ministry of Education on October 10th of the 19th year of the Republic is based on the same principle as the previous table. However, it uses both subtraction and addition. When calculating, simply subtract the number of years to be subtracted from the nominal age, then add the number of months to be added to obtain the actual age. In addition, the actual age calculation method published by Yan Xinzhe and the actual age conversion table printed by the Commercial Press are completely the same as the one issued by the Ministry of Education. Although the above methods are slightly better than calculating actual age using nominal age, they are still not very accurate. Because the calculations are all based on months, in other words, if the birthday and the date of the examination for two people are both in the same month but one is at the beginning and one is at the end of the month, there is no difference on these tables, but in reality, there may be a difference of up to one month. The tables do not list leap years and leap months. Failure to calculate Gregorian leap years results in a difference of only one day. Failure to calculate lunar leap months results in a difference of 29 or 30 days. This type of error seems difficult to ignore. Moreover, none of the tables can be used to calculate the corresponding dates of the Gregorian and lunar calendars, the heavenly stems and earthly branches, or the days of the week.</p>
<p>(3) Hong and Chen's Table of Gregorian and Lunar Calendar Correspondences</p>
<p>Hong published a book in 1910 titled "Correspondence between Gregorian and Lunar Calendar Dates," which contains 569 pages, covering the years from 841 to 2020 of the Gregorian calendar, a total of 1,179 years. The table lists the first day of each lunar month and the corresponding Gregorian date, and also includes the heavenly stems and earthly branches for each month and the first day of each day. To find the correspondence for any date, it is necessary to calculate day by day from the first day of each day. Chen's "Chinese-Western-Islamic Calendar" was published in 1926, in five volumes, covering the years from the Gregorian era (the first year of Emperor Ping of Han) to 1940 (the 29th year of the Republic of China). It was created by calculating the correspondences between the three calendars day by day using mechanical methods. The last volume also includes tables of heavenly stems and earthly branches, days of the week, etc. The tables created by the above two individuals are both based on days and include leap years and leap months, making them very accurate. However, because the volumes are numerous, checking them takes a lot of time, and it is extremely difficult to calculate the distance between two different periods from them. The price of the books is relatively high, and they are not affordable for the average person.</p>
<p>(4) Actual Age Calculation Tool</p>
<p>Recently created by Dr. Wu Dingliang of the Academia Sinica, it only requires knowing a person's nominal age and the month and day of their lunar birth to instantly calculate: 1. A person's Gregorian and lunar birth year; 2. A person's Gregorian birth month and day; 3. The heavenly stems and earthly branches of a person's birth year, month, and day; 4. The day of the week of a person's birth; 5. The distance between a person's birth date and the date of the examination, i.e., a person's actual age. The above methods can not only be applied to modern people, but also to the conversion of the lunar and Gregorian dates of historical figures' chronologies and historical facts. Its advantages include at least the following: Accurate calculation: The tool is based on days, and includes Gregorian leap years and lunar leap months, with no error. Time-saving: It takes no more than 40 seconds to find the above five answers, which is faster than specifically finding the corresponding dates of the Gregorian and lunar calendars in the books of Hong and Chen. Convenient to use: The tool is made of wood, with three outer, middle, and inner wheels. Each wheel is engraved with various degrees. The outer and inner wheels are fixed. When used, only the middle wheel needs to be moved, and the various answers can be obtained in order. It resembles a compass, is 6 inches in diameter and 8 points thick, making it easy to carry. Detailed instructions are provided separately. It is anticipated that the invention of this tool will be beneficial to the educational community.</p>

<p>The Tianjin-Shanghai interport football match, originally scheduled to be held in Tianjin on Christmas, has been officially cancelled due to the Shanghai team's inability to form a team. The Shanghai team's trip north for the match had been negotiated long ago through correspondence. Mr. Spick, the secretary of the Shanghai Western Football Association, recently went to Tianjin on business and further discussed the matter in person. The Tianjin team agreed to come to Shanghai for a triangular interport match during the Lunar New Year as an exchange. After Mr. Spick returned to Shanghai, he sent more than 40 letters to outstanding players from various teams in the city, soliciting their participation in the match in Tianjin. However, as of yesterday, only 14 replies were received, and most of them were center backs and fullbacks, making it impossible to form a team. Therefore, the Tianjin Western Football Association was immediately informed by telegram that the Christmas match was cancelled and that the trip north would be postponed until Easter next spring. As for the triangular interport match, the Tianjin team is still invited to come to Shanghai. It is not known what Tianjin's reply will be. In addition, the Wales Army, which was transferred from Shanghai to Tianjin, will be leaving Tianjin and returning to the country at the beginning of next month. Therefore, the strength of the Tianjin team will inevitably be reduced for the Lunar New Year interport match. Toler and Smith will not be able to play.</p>

<p>The women's basketball tournament organized by the Chinese Athletic Federation has already seen Chongde secure the championship. However, the runner-up spot is still undecided. The match between Patriotic School and Guanghua School, held at Patriotic School today at 9:00 AM, is quite significant. Guanghua has suffered repeated defeats and can only be relegated to last place. If Patriotic School can defeat Guanghua, their score will be equal to Qixiu's, making another deciding match unnecessary. If they tie, the runner-up will go to Qixiu. Therefore, Patriotic School will put forth its full effort today to defeat Guanghua and have the chance to compete with Qixiu again.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Mrs. March paused at the foot of the stairs, looking quite weary after her fright and the long journey.</p>
<p>"Poor Aunt March is so tired, she needs someone to help her upstairs herself," gentle Franz said, as he put his arm around her.</p>
<p>"Let's make a big armchair for her," Tommy suggested.</p>
<p>"No, thank you, my boys; but if someone would lend me a shoulder to lean on, that would do," Mrs. March replied.</p>
<p>"Me! Me!" five or six voices exclaimed at once, for there was something in that pale, motherly face that touched the hearts under those round jackets.</p>
<p>Mrs. March, seeing that they regarded it as an honor, gave it to the most deserving one, so there was not a murmur when she leaned on Don's broad shoulder, and the grateful look on her face made his cheek flush with pleasure, as she said:</p>
<p>"He found the children; so I think he must help me up."</p>
<p>Don felt that he had been richly rewarded for his work that evening, and not only did he proudly carry the lamp and escort Mrs. March upstairs, but as he was about to leave her at her door, she said sincerely, "Good-night, my boy! God bless you!"</p>
<p>"I wish I really was your boy!" said Don, feeling as if hardship and tribulation had brought him nearer to her.</p>
<p>"You may be my big boy," she said, as she sealed the deep feeling with a touch of her hand.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market suddenly experienced a surge. The central bank initially opened with strong buying interest. Later, after a large transaction, the price fell to 19.5 pence, and various rumors about currency systems spread. By closing, the price had risen to around 76 yuan. In the morning, news came from overseas stating that large forward transactions were still halted, with the base reporting no transactions from the US. Large transactions could not be completed, with recent listings at 23 pence, which was the seller's price, down 1.875 pence from the previous day. American silver fell by 3 cents, and forward silver prices in Monte Video fell by 1 to 2 cents, etc. The exchange rate was stable. The price of gold in London rose by 1.5 pence, and reports indicated some gold exports, boosting confidence.

After the fall, prices gradually stabilized and fluctuated. When the silver equalization tax was announced, falling by 10.5%, it had no impact. Buyers became more active and rebounded. Rumors spread that the central bank was buying 390+ bars of spot silver, boosting confidence and breaking through the 50 yuan mark again. Despite major players seizing the opportunity to sell at high prices, the market was optimistic, and buying interest surged. At noon, prices continued to rise, and the same was true after closing. This was because a certain foreign firm's private cable reported that large transactions had fallen to 19.5 pence after closing. The market became more confident, continuing to rise. However, due to the strength of the three major banks in suppressing short-term foreign exchange, prices fluctuated around 60 yuan. Despite repeated attempts by Chinese and foreign banks to intervene, forward foreign exchange remained tight, buying interest surged, and rumors abounded. Major players competed to buy, rising again to around 70 yuan. Subsequently, prices fell back slightly due to the entry and exit of major players. However, the market's eagerness remained strong, and buyers rushed in one after another. Short positions were caught off guard and rushed to cover, breaking through the 70 yuan mark.

<h3 id="e193">Securities: Short Covering and Arbitrage Rise Simultaneously, Bond Market Reacts and Rises, Large Purchases Are Also Quite Forceful <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market prices at the Chinese Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly. Initially, the shorts relied on their strong momentum and exerted strong pressure on the longs, most notably with the Disarmament Bonds. Although the longs have persistently held on recently, the rapid drop in the forward contracts caused a sell-off. As a result, forward market prices plummeted, and recent prices could not maintain normalcy. The shorts' tactics were considered clever. Based on the surface situation, the shorts could have prevailed for a time. However, because prices had fallen significantly in recent days, some of the profitable shorts started to cover their positions, and arbitrage transactions also became active. Large players also seemed to be entering the market. The situation turned around, and the downtrend ended. Subsequently, prices gradually rose, with most securities recovering several angles or even one, two, or three yuan. However, the Disarmament Bonds alone fell by a weak half yuan. A few other securities fell by two or three angles. Observing the trend, the trading for this month has reached the final stage, and the future of market prices is full of changes. Throughout the day, at the morning opening, recent Disarmament Bonds slightly decreased by two angles. When the call numbers of the forward contracts suddenly had a large amount of supply, and retail investors also joined in the selling pressure, the market price fell from the opening price of 79.15 yuan to the closing price of 78.3 yuan. The difference between the two was nearly one yuan. The shorts gained momentum, and market sentiment became increasingly volatile. 54, 78, and 35 bonds were sold off, and various bonds fell by two, three, or even six or seven angles. The rush to cover short positions turned the gold short market active, and market prices suddenly stabilized. Decisive trades of 33, 21, 43, etc., were smoothly filled, arbitrage transactions were actively initiated, and 46 bonds were strongly pushed up in price. A sudden recovery occurred, and market prices suddenly rose by three, five angles, or even around one yuan. In the morning's trades, the buyers became more active, and the general shorts continued to switch to the forward contracts. Various bonds rose by about half a yuan. In summary, the total transaction volume for the day was approximately 30 million yuan. Here is a list of the high and low results:</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday's (17th) New York stock market experienced mixed price movements. Initially, there was an upward trend, but later, due to the sharp drop in silver prices, it rebounded slightly. However, railway, petroleum, transportation, and specialty stocks showed an upward trend at the close. The bond market and the small exchange closed with slightly higher mixed results. The total volume traded for the day was 1,690,000 shares. Here are the Dow Jones New York indexes:</p>

<p>The yarn market trends firm, a sudden surge in prices occurs, and the long-dormant metal standard suddenly leaps upward.

The (financial) situation is particularly tight, with both bulls and bears bidding up prices. The market advances bravely, with all months rising by 1.5 to 3.4 yuan. This month, the bulls prepare to take delivery of goods.</p>
<p>Various Groups Frenziedly Absorb the "Golden Chicken" (Profitable Yarn)</p>
<p>Before the opening of the yarn market, the price was initially weak due to American cotton's powerlessness, and third-grade yarn fell below the 200 yuan mark. Market sentiment stabilized, and prices in all months fell by 0.3 yuan. However, by the second and third rounds of trading, rumors spread that the China Cotton Company intended to take delivery of goods this month, and market prices rebounded. As a result, all months rose by 0.35 to 0.69 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, news of a sharp rise in the metal standard agitated the market, and outsiders rushed into the market to absorb (yarn). (Companies such as) Geng Feng, Chang Feng, and Run Kang vigorously bought in. However, Tong Cheng Company took advantage of the price increase to sell off, but the fiery momentum remained intense, with all months soaring by more than 2 yuan. The second and third rounds (of trading) remained firm. As a result, all months rose by 1.4 to 2.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price.

<p>The cotton market soared because the metal standard suddenly rose, agitating the market. Bulls aggressively purchased (cotton) again, and market prices trended higher and higher. March and April futures simultaneously broke through the 44 yuan mark. However, overseas cotton markets are still trending downward. Nevertheless, the exchange rate is contracting, and the price of foreign cotton is secretly rising, so the bulls are very active.</p>
<p>Bullish Forces Active</p>
<p>Before the opening of the flower (cotton) market, the price was affected by the Indian cotton (report) and Robbie (report) of 5, and the American cotton (market) was sluggish and powerless, falling by 5 to 7 points. Market sentiment was mediocre. The opening price of the first round (of trading) fell by 0.2 yuan. By the second and third rounds, Geng (Feng) and Yi Chang pulled in (cotton), and the market trend turned from weak to firm. As a result, all months rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, all months surged because the Yu (remaining) market rose, and outsiders flocked in, causing prices to rise sharply. Near and distant months jumped by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. Da Feng, Geng Feng, and Yuan Yi vigorously purchased (cotton). Tong Cheng Company and Tong Ji Xin Cheng sold off as much as possible, but the bullish sentiment was intense. By the time of closing, the May futures had risen by another 0.1 yuan, with the metal standard breaking through the 70 (yuan) mark.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market situation was sluggish, with very little fluctuation. Later, due to brokers covering short positions, the market situation turned firm. Buyers were scarce, and transactions were few. The textile market was quiet and weak. In terms of current demand, the market was also sluggish due to weaker local conditions. Finally, due to bulls closing positions and local groups actually selling off, the market weakened again. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, futures prices rose by 1 point to fall by 6 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 2 points, futures prices fell by 2 points. Indian cotton saw some bull liquidation, with Pingguoer falling by 0.5 to 1 Robbie, Aomula falling by 0.5 to 1.25 Robbie, and Bairoxi remaining unchanged. (Telegram of the 18th)</p>

<p>The flour market showed a slight profit amid calm. The price of foreign wheat from Chicago was better by 1/4 to 1/2 cent, and Canadian wheat was better by around (blank) cent. At the opening, most people in the industry and outside were watching due to settlement reasons, so trading was very quiet, with little fluctuation. Near-term contracts were similar to the previous day, and far-term contracts were slightly better by 1/2 to 1 cent. By the afternoon opening, near and far-term contracts suddenly became tight because the exchange rate fell, and gold prices trended upward. The flower and yarn markets all rose sharply, so bullish sentiment was strong, and all months surged by 3 to 4 cents. Factories recalled near-term contracts, and far-term contracts were still being sold off. If foreign wheat prices continue to improve, market sentiment within the industry should become more active.</p>
<p>The wheat market was consistently quiet in the morning and afternoon openings. Although foreign wheat prices showed a slight improvement, trading in the industry was generally limited as settlement was approaching. Moreover, foreign wheat prices fluctuated uncertainly, and out-of-town customers were not operating, so most months saw short selling and little vitality. Although the gold market rose and flour prices rebounded in the afternoon, buyers remained on the sidelines, so the results were still calm. The current wheat market saw sluggish delivery. High-quality goods had not been delivered. The opening price for Jiangbei wheat was 4.76 yuan, and the opening price for Tiantai wheat was 4.61 yuan. A total of 1,000 bags were handled by Fu Xin.</p>
<p>The US wheat harvest is estimated by the US government to be 603,199,000 bushels.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups still numbered more than 50 (with a total of more than 10,000 piculs of goods). Sales in this street were even more sluggish, and the market situation was extremely depressed. The price of thick early japonica rice fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the situation of passenger Xian rice (rice from other areas) still showed no signs of improvement. As sources arrived continuously, such as Jiangxi Wentai, and other ports were also shipping out in succession, and the only outlet was this street. Households, because market prices were gradually falling, had already suffered losses on inventory, and the new taste was very sluggish. Except for the rice from the He Xia (river bottom), the Northern groups temporarily did not inquire about passenger Xian rice. Therefore, yesterday's market was even more sluggish. Although the selling price was similar to the previous day's market, the quality of the goods had been different by a few cents. Wen Tai rice of 1,300 bags opened throughout the day, Shao rice of 369 bags, Gan rice of 286 bags, Shashi An (blank) of 100 bags each, all handled by this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday, high-grade Zhuang Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi and other routes sold quite well. (Companies such as) Yih He, Yong Xing, and Fu (blank) (blank) opened offices because of the activation of overseas sales.

Yesterday, Shandong and Tianjin groups separately purchased (tea) and completed no less than 600 bags. The market price opened at 8.5 yuan, and there was a trend of watching (blank).</p>

<p>Quanzhou longan, previously because the number of arrivals was relatively large, while sales were small, people's hearts turned lax, and it was difficult for the price to remain firm for a long time, but it was still inevitable to drop slightly. Yesterday, it was heard that the number party had opened (selling), Chen Quan soaked round of more than 300 bags, the price dropped by nearly 1 yuan. However, it was found that the old goods of the number party had been exhausted, and all the remaining were new goods, and the rear market also prevented loosening.</p>

<p>Thick woolen overcoats, the current sales are extraordinarily smooth, because the weather is cold, and the actual sales have risen sharply, especially plain-colored thick woolen cloth are particularly smooth. Primary color is in short supply and even more charming, and the trend of evergreen camel is not weak. Since the multicolored flashing woolen overcoats have been outdated, in recent years, only pure plain colors have been the most popular and universal. Because it assessed that the market inventory was not abundant, most large sellers shouted to raise the price by 5 to 10 cents per yard yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e205">In the Wind and Snow <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>There is no killing, no fighting, but people's hearts have become as dark as the weather. From which gust of wind did this bloodless smell come?</p>
<p>Darkness not only surrounds people's hearts, but also envelops the earth. People are trapped in dreams, not knowing what kind of days they are living. Unparalleled chaos is in front of their eyes, and their throats are suffocating as if something is stuck in them. Their feet are like a ship that has hit a reef, tossing and sinking. What is most certain is that this ferocious storm will end your cries. In this instant, the emotion that covers your heart is anger—anger covers fear—open your eyes wide and look into the distance, but it is too late to resent and ask for help.</p>
<p>"Iron crows, one, two, three..."</p>
<p>"Red dots—"</p>
<p>People shielded their foreheads with their hands and looked at the sky. The sky was filled with green clouds.</p>
<p>Old women began to scold: "Why doesn't the wind blow them down?" Children, however, instinctively picked up stones in their hands and threw them into the air, pouting: "Beat you to death!"</p>
<p>The voices of newspaper sellers on the streets and alleys were even more lively. "News" expanded its territory in people's hearts. People did not forget to prick up their ears to listen. In the dead of night, mixed with the cries of hawkers, the voices of newspaper boys touched people's heartstrings. Everyone had their own plans, but the overall implication was: a very important eve had arrived. The newspaper boys on the carts added new lyrics to their calls, almost using the same attitude as distributing pamphlets to attract customers. Their efforts were not in vain. Many hands did not hesitate to spend that big coin.</p>
<p>The advertising columns were filled with advertisements for "× Language Crash Courses," specifying "× Overseas Chinese" or "Studied × Abroad." Apart from the tactics, the consistency was: speculation, making a living.</p>
<p>On the streets and in the markets, there were more sounds of wooden clogs and beards with *Jintan* toothpaste powder on them. Women with heavy makeup carried small leather balls on the streets, and they still had to hold up their vests when sitting in rickshaws. The small leather balls chattered behind their backs, as if they were endlessly puzzled by this new place. Who can explain the magic of this ancient city?</p>
<p>Small bicycles were constantly coming and going in the alleys near ×× Elementary School. Children with mailbox-like schoolbags on their backs were pedaling hard, giggling and sliding past. Children playing with piles of gray sand on the ground squinted and muttered after calculating for a while:</p>
<p>"Little ××, selling cold noodles... (Note: a nursery rhyme.)</p>
<p>The signs of foreign companies were hung densely, so many that they were inexplicable, but the open secret was only chilling. Suddenly, they remembered some people in the Northeast who had lost their fortunes, those thin skeletons with sunken eyes were shaking in front of them.</p>
<p>When they heard the not-so-low sound of gunfire, people immediately gained wisdom after being frightened: it was ×× soldiers practicing shooting. On the ×× parade ground on the street, clusters of soldiers in uniforms with red edges gathered, short, smoky legs running on the sandy ground. Others were riding horses. People walked by quietly, muttering some spells in their hearts and starting some unrealistic dreams.</p>
<p>But dreams are just dreams.</p>
<p>When newspapers, like electric currents, only brought disappointment when they touched their eyes, people sighed deeply. Although some old diehards were still walking on the sidewalks with their birdcages covered with cotton covers, with the mentality of letting it go. Merchants frowned for the dark clouds. The station was abnormally crowded. The scales at the baggage room door and the boxes and cages were piled up like mountains. Cowardly souls bid farewell to this ancient city for the last time, harboring a little sorrow for it.</p>
<p>The Dongjiaominxiang (Legation Quarter) added more vehicles and horses. Some fat-headed and big-eared people found a sheltered place again, as if a child had entered its mother's arms.</p>
<p>Young people couldn't bear this suffocation and roared like lions, making righteous calls. The common people saw the cloud-like troops and inquired with each other. Flowers bloomed on their worried faces, joy floated in their hearts, and a little hope and a little light grew.</p>
<p>Swords and gun stocks appeared. More compatriots with belts were added to the roadblocks, listening to commands and doing things that they themselves did not understand, and a pleading expression was implied in the expulsion. The fire truck's faucet emitted water, acting as a fire extinguisher to extinguish the flames, but it was sweeping people. Young people retreated in the water flow and gun stocks, leaving a street of ice.</p>
<p>In the north wind, the coolies did not forget these interesting (?) dramas, discussing and regretting. The wind and clouds of the North Country flashed in people's hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Dream of Snow <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Heiding</p>
<p>It is another cold and gloomy winter.</p>
<p>Yet there is still no snow. For days, all the shadows under the sun have been pushed into the dark crevices of the earth by a layer of dim color. My room is filled with dim light, and it is cold. In this way, loneliness gives me some sad and long feelings. I am used to poking my head out of the window, with a thoughtful expression, staring with bright eyes, blankly, at the light and thin floating clouds scattered in the ancient and quiet sky. Concentrating.</p>
<p>Is it going to snow?</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. I have a string of silent shouts. My mood is suffering from the winter seasonal disease. My thoughts are disturbed by the dream of snow.</p>
<p>I disinterestedly shrunk my head back, and the window closed easily. I paced around the room.</p>
<p>Remembering—</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, I sadly wrote this small essay:</p>
<p>A dog in the snow thinks of home.</p>
<p>Wavelike heart, no way to arrange. Melancholy eyes, staring at the snowflakes outside the window, flying down one by one.</p>
<p>Life is like a snowflake flying to the ground.</p>
<p>Wandering dream, lost the road of youth, lonely trudging on this dark road of life</p>
<p>It has been more than two years since I went home.</p>
<p>It is now deep winter, my body is sadly cold, and my heart is sadly cold! I just think: the snow in my hometown should be falling in large swaths, covering the entire earth with white.</p>
<p>I love the snow in my hometown, the snow in my hometown hides the spring of my childhood.</p>
<p>However, the snow in my hometown is now stained with bright red blood! Shouldn't we lightly forget that lost free home!</p>
<p>It must be said to be a sad thing, since the great uprising of September 18th, my home was broken, and my family members were exiled, so I slowly forgot my home! Then I began to take the strength of life and step firmly on the road to wandering.</p>
<p>The heart is ardent, and it is also looking forward to the light of the future.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the heart is smiling and caningly whispering: Quickly follow the wheels of history and turn to a new stage.</p>
<p>So, I was reborn.</p>
<p>I have no home. I wander everywhere. I identify a direction.</p>
<p>I have tasted a lot of the bitterness of life alone; this journey of life, how long and fast it is!</p>
<p>Often a little small stimulus will slow down my forward force, which is my biggest shortcoming. However, I can always remember that people have to move forward to be able to live.</p>
<p>I have already forged myself into a person who is used to living in a foreign land. But at the same time, I have also become a melancholy person; I did not smile in spring, I did not smile in summer, I did not smile in autumn, and in winter, I looked at the snowflakes outside the window and added a touch of sadness!</p>
<p>Now, the winter in ××, where I am staying, is deep, and my heart is also heavily ill! I can't help but sing a dirge to this first snow</p>
<p>So, I thought of home.</p>
<p>The deep winter in the Northeast, what a beautiful world of snow it should be!</p>
<p>Can I still open my throat and shout out the sad melody of my heart?</p>
<p>A lonely wanderer who has lost his home spends a long and desolate life in sour and eternal, which is really a kind of unbearable bitterness! This mood is like a black net, tightly covering my entire mind, but it makes me suffocate without a breath. I have no day, night is my narrow world. The wings of sorrow cannot leave my surroundings. I curse the day, and I curse the night. I don't know what will excite me and make me laugh foolishly. But I also don't know what will excite me and make me cry timidly. At night, I have become accustomed to not sleeping even once, and I love to wander alone in the dead streets illuminated by the stars. I feel that this is my happiest moment. I have been careful to count the days since I was a child, and even on my birthday, I let it pass secretly. My mood is getting older day by day. In autumn and winter, when a leaf falls on my body, I blankly shudder! But I am not surprised, I stand down calmly. I know that the change of seasons is turning again under my feet. Therefore, I want to shout loudly for a while. But my shout is dumb. My side is so lonely, I can't see a person's shadow. (There is a large pile of skeletons, let it go, it will eventually be destroyed!) I began to think that I was indeed too lonely, I needed friends, and I needed fresh air even more.</p>
<p>But the night air formed a ball of hazy mist.</p>
<p>I walk carefully. I'm afraid of falling. But my roadside has two very deep mud ditches.</p>
<p>In this way, after a year, two years,... sorrow no longer belongs to me. Home, home, the home that gave birth to me, I simply dare not put it in my thoughts anymore. I'm afraid it will provoke me and make me restless on the road. What a worm that is easy to stimulate my troubles.</p>
<p>Home, home, the shadow of home gradually diminished in my thoughts.</p>
<p>Even in winter, I no longer think of home.</p>
<p>(The snow in my hometown emits a white light in my dream)</p>
<p>On the road where there are homes for wanderers everywhere, I have seen all the same seasons pass before my eyes. For example, the winter in the south is not easy to see snowy days. This is a disturbing thing. But the winter in the north is not like that, the cold has changed to another face, the ground is covered with snowflakes, but the mountains and fields are covered with white.</p>
<p>I have never stopped my walking because of the snow, and I feel very happy on the road. I often shout wildly to the mountains and fields. I also often chant softly to the snow. Snow is no longer familiar in my inspiration. It is my faithful travel companion. I have never cursed it, I think it is lovely. Always, it is sometimes wrapped by the violent northwest wind and pounced on my face, but I run quickly, and in no time, my body will be immersed in sweat. My face is steaming, and the snowflakes gradually turn into water. I walk, I listen to the snow scratching under my feet. The sound is really fresh.</p>
<p>But sometimes, I have also been blown by the snow, and I have been sick several times in a mountain village home. It's okay, I still wouldn't curse it. It is lovely. It is my faithful travel companion.</p>
<p>Braving the snow, I have been to many small towns. Therefore, I met several young friends who were of the same mind.</p>
<p>On the banks of the cold Erguna River, there are shadows of several of our young friends every day. The snow on the banks of the river is deeply stepped on by the footprints of our vagrants.</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, those young friends of mine were finally swallowed up by the dark evil forces. Leaving me, lonely, still a wanderer.</p>
<p>Now, winter has come. Shouldn't the winter scenery of the northern wilderness be a white sheet again?</p>
<p>So, my thoughts are disturbed by the dream of snow.</p>
<p>My past hard life on the snowy ground. My past few young friends who were killed.</p>

<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>Writers of the old Russian era often used love stories to express their political views. Although they achieved considerable success in the literary realm of storytelling, making readers feel they were experiencing pure art without perceiving any political undertones, readers often understood and sympathized with the authors' hidden intentions. In Chinese literary works, a portion of untitled poems can be said to have been created using a similar technique, but their attitude is often not very serious, so what they can express is not a definitive opinion, but only some delicate techniques. By the time readers see them, the author's original intention cannot be noticed. Perhaps the author did not fail to hope to make a deeper expression, but the environment limited him. To use the view of love to express the view of politics, it is first necessary to be able to express their view of love as much as possible, but talking about love in old China, just like talking about politics in old Russia, could become a crime. Therefore, what is similar to using love to symbolize politics is not those allegorical untitled poems, but rather those stories that use immortals and ghosts to express human love. Hereafter, these are collectively referred to as Immortal-Ghost stories. Perhaps because the habit of banning talk of love in China was too deep, the reason why the author had to describe it that way seems to have never been noticed. Now, the narration of immortal-ghost stories seems to have become the most ridiculed point of old-fashioned literati, which is really a bit unfair. Generally, suppressed emotions will erupt in strange ways, and the narration of immortal-ghost stories sometimes cannot be denied as a way for old-time literati to express their suppressed emotions. The stimulation of suppressed emotions is often the cause of great works, although immortal-ghost stories have not produced many works that have reached as good as expected, but it is not necessarily that they should all be dismissed.</p>
<p>Comparing modern fox-ghost stories with Tang Dynasty legends, one can generally lament the decline of works. Looking at the content, we can see that they become more and more absurd, but we must not forget that part of the reason is due to the tighter and tighter shackles. From "The Story of Yingying," which can be circulated, we know that the people of the Tang Dynasty did have considerable tolerance for love, but later generations have a lot of discussion about this article, because the story is about Zhang Sheng, inferring that the protagonist is Zhang Ji, then criticizing Zhang Ji, and some infer that it is the author's self-narration, then criticizing Yuan Zhen. Later generations of authors, seeing such encounters, naturally dare not repeat the same mistake and leave discussions for later generations, not to mention that perhaps criticism does not have to wait for later generations, and contemporary people will come to criticize. The Tang Dynasty's legends of immortal encounters are probably not fabricated, but conceal actual human events, just like Li Shangyin's untitled poems, the facts contained in them, if they were clearly stated at the time, would be enough to bring disaster, so they could not pretend to encounter immortals. Zhang Zhu's "Youxian Cave" probably records what he encountered was a proud, extravagant, and lewd princess. Shen Yazhi's "Jin Ci Ji" even hopes to see ancient empresses, which may not be said to involve the palace. If it can be inferred in this way, then the ingenious technique of concealing real events with the guise of bizarre faces has achieved considerable results. It is only natural that later generations specialized in following this ingenious technique.</p>
<p>The legendary aspects were inherited by later notes, and on the one hand, they also developed into popular novels. Novels in the style of talented scholars and beautiful women can also be said to be a main vein of legends. This aspect seems to focus on the human world, but as soon as we see the uniformity of the stories in these novels, we immediately feel that the human world that is allowed to be written is really pitifully small. No matter how low the author's talent is, it is difficult for us to assume that he does not even have the slightest ambition to try to escape the prison. The author really does not want to escape, but is not allowed to escape. The author of "Hua Jian Ji," at the beginning, explained his idea: "As long as both parties can complete the relationship, then what harm is there in secretly dating?" This limit of complete relationship is almost maintained by the entire society with all its strength, so talented scholars and beautiful women books have to always be so pitiful. An author who wants to write about a wider human world has to entrust it to immortals and ghosts.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot say that all immortal-ghost stories have their human background. Taoist thought has a long-standing basis and continuous spread in China, and the atmosphere of liking vague and absurd theories is very prevalent, and naturally it will produce many fabricated absurd stories. But we can also say that Taoist imagination can continuously run parallel with Confucian thought, because it has a human basis. Because Taoism is constantly rejected by Confucianism, the ideal world it constructs is only placed in heaven. Originally, Taoism did not fail to want to create such a world in the human world. If Taoist thought had ever occupied the same power as Confucian thought, then the fictional stories could probably also use the human world as the background. The modern life situation after drastic changes, when heard by the old-fashioned people in the countryside, while adhering to Confucian doctrines, they naturally sigh and shake their heads, but sometimes they also feel like listening to beautiful myths, which is enough to illustrate how suppressed emotions want to be expressed.</p>
<p>Once this suppressed emotion is liberated, then immortal-ghost stories will naturally disappear. This can be seen from the gradual decline of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" style notes after the rise of erotic novels. "The Directory of Famous Courtesans," which is considered the earliest work of eroticism, allows it to show such a trend. Some people say that the protagonist Qin Yan in the book does not look like a male at all, which is the weakness of this book. But we don't seem to have to regard this book as a realistic depiction of the situation of befriending actors. Its writing method can be said to be still a kind of entrustment, so what is written will naturally not look like a woman. This book is not entirely the same as the later novels about prostitutes. The depiction of prostitutes, due to the limitations of real objects, although the author tries his best to make them faint, often cannot get his wish, so in the end they form like "Nine-tailed Turtle." This is walking out of a narrow human world and walking into another narrow human world. This aspect is no longer enough to express suppressed emotions, and the times have changed. Readers have long had translated romance novels to read, and authors dare to imitate Western works and write romance novels. The wide sales of "The Jade Pear Spirit" are said to be due to the style of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School, but it is not as good as saying that it is due to the ability to appeal to the emotions of ordinary people seeking liberation. At this time, it is possible for real human beings to replace fictional immortals and ghosts. According to reason, real people should be depicted as more active than immortals and ghosts, and the emotional expression in the works should be more beautiful. But up to now, we don't seem to be able to find many moving shadows in new works that exceed what is written in immortal-ghost stories. Great achievements in literature are very difficult to achieve, then immortal-ghost stories are not the least accomplished item in literary works, and to think that it is the most despicable.</p>

<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>The watchman in our Nanyang newspaper office is not an Indian Asam with a thick beard, but a Shantou man who is getting old quickly, his hair turned white before he was fifty, and his appearance is a bit hunched, which is very strange to me. On the second day I came here to be a small editor, because the manager was a relative, I said to him in a conversation:</p>
<p>"Isn't the Indian Asam more qualified to be a doorman? Our doorman is not majestic enough!"</p>
<p>The person who heard me laughed: "Isn't it? I say you are too young to be the editor-in-chief. Your job now is to find a way to make the newspaper's end better, that's your job. Why do you want to express your opinion to the doorman?"</p>
<p>"Really, I don't like him very much..." I mumbled and walked out of the manager's office.</p>
<p>This hunched old man is called Tang Bing. Not only is his hair white, but he has also lost a few teeth, and his face is wrinkled and ugly. During the day, he sits at the gate, looking at everyone who comes in with dull eyes, without saying a word. We are an afternoon newspaper, so it is especially crowded at noon. Some newspaper delivery guys also enter and exit through the gate, so it is noisy and chaotic, and Tang Bing has absolutely no way to maintain order. He is afraid of people, and occasionally he shouts at a newspaper delivery person who does not keep order in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Don't shout, don't..."</p>
<p>"What are you saying, old thing?"</p>
<p>When that person turned around and faced him with a fierce look, as if he had encountered some great oppression, Tang Bing immediately fell silent and dared not interfere with them anymore.</p>
<p>Such a useless watchman...</p>
<p>My job was not troublesome at all, and I had a lot of free time to sit in the editorial office and read newspapers and magazines sent from various places. Maybe it was because the manager often came here and saw me idle there. One day, he called me over and asked me to sit on the sofa next to the desk in a very kind manner. Then, smoking a cigar, he said to me:</p>
<p>"Our newspaper office is going to be three years old in two months. I want you to do something... like a special issue..."</p>
<p>"Okay. But I..."</p>
<p>"They are all busy," he interrupted me like this. "I see there is still so much time, so you can take it up. It will also be good for you to forge yourself."</p>
<p>In this way, I had to be responsible for the anniversary issue of more than two hundred pages. The newspaper office here does not give manuscript fees as a rule, and I have no way to find someone to write articles. I think it should be my busiest time in these two months.</p>
<p>The days to publication were getting closer and closer, and under the manager's constant urging, I decided to work overtime. So almost every night, in order to have the convenience of consulting books, I went to the newspaper office to work. There, I had more opportunities to get close to Tang Bing.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, you're working hard." He sparsely walked into the door of the editorial office, saying this to me.</p>
<p>"Um..." I felt that he had barged in and simply disrupted my thoughts. After responding, I was about to raise my head and tell him to go out, but I saw him under the electric light, smiling kindly, holding a cup of tea in his hand, trembling slightly, and putting it on the table.</p>
<p>"If you want tea, Mr. Chen, just call me." He said.</p>
<p>I nodded. Yes, sometimes when I was thirsty and wanted water, I didn't know who to call. There was no one in the newspaper office! The watchman Tang Bing was naturally always there, and he slept by the door at night with a thin blanket on his body. But I never used him.</p>
<p>"It's cold outside, right?" I saw him still standing there, so I asked casually.</p>
<p>"It's okay. Isn't Mr. Chen also very lonely here alone?"</p>
<p>"If you talk about loneliness, you must be even more so, Tang Bing!" I simply put down my pen and chatted with him.</p>
<p>Tang Bing smiled bitterly: "What can we do? Fate is destined. Mr. Chen, if my son hadn't died, then the situation wouldn't be like this..." As if his sadness was aroused, he stopped talking in a frustrated manner.</p>
<p>I thought, let Tang Bing have a chance to pour out the accumulated depression in his heart. So I asked about his life. He immediately sat down and said to me as if he had found a confidant:</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, everything is destined by fate. I once had a son. To be honest, this little thing was not bad at all. He studied very hard... I had long wanted to rely on my son in old age. Enjoying the happiness of children and grandchildren is the happiest thing in life, so when his mother died, I was not very sad; I wholeheartedly cultivated him... One day I went to the temple to ask for a lottery, saying that if I didn't cultivate well, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the happiness of children and grandchildren; Mr. Chen, where am I not cultivating with good intentions? It's just that I only have thirty yuan a month, and I have to provide for my son's tuition. At that time, I was a carpenter."</p>
<p>"Then your son..."</p>
<p>"The sacred lottery was fulfilled, I don't have this kind of blessing. My son died of typhoid fever when he was nineteen years old!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" I responded, leaned my back against the back of the chair, and saw a beam of tears that could not flow out from Tang Bing's sluggish eye sockets.</p>
<p>I looked at this old man with sympathetic eyes, but I couldn't say anything after all. He believes in gods, believes in fate; he lacks the ability to recognize reality. In the end, I asked:</p>
<p>"Did you send him to the hospital at that time?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, we are poor people, we can't go to the hospital, so..."</p>
<p>It's eleven o'clock. He should go outside to lock the door and sleep under it, so that he can get twenty yuan in salary. But when he left, he kept murmuring:</p>
<p>"What can you do if fate is destined?"</p>
<p>Not long after, the old watchman was sick. And it was a hopeless disease. The manager sent him to a public hospital. When I went to visit him, he was very concerned about whether the third anniversary issue had been published; asking if I was still going to the newspaper office at night. I felt that he had lost so much weight that only his bones were left...</p>
<p>A few days later, Tang Bing died...</p>
<p>The watchman was replaced by the Indian Asam, tall and majestic. Every time I walked into that gate, he would salute me, his posture was a bit funny. But I often think of the hunched and weak Tang Bing until I returned to China.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Reality of Love <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>Love between the sexes, between parents and children, is sometimes expressed in a strangely abnormal manner — in direct violation of ordinary behavior.</p>
<p>Once, in a filthy, dimly lit little house blackened by coal smoke on Yuanyuan Street in the provincial capital, I ran into a woman. The landlord, Zhu Juexian, was a friend of mine, a fortune teller who made a living by deception. After five months of unemployment, I moved in with him because I had nowhere to live.</p>
<p>She was a nineteen-year-old mother who worked at a medicinal herb shop every day. Her husband worked as a handyman at a tin shop, and together they could earn fourteen yuan a month. Their boy was called A Yu, just two years old, intelligent and strong.</p>
<p>The 1930s—we have a barbaric, violent, cruel world where shameless force is praised or celebrated, and curses and lies are what we hear; this is the truth, and we prove it with any character in any street corner. In fact, the woman I met had a painful life after marriage. She spoke publicly in front of many people about what had happened, from her hometown to Zengcheng, where they spent their "honeymoon," in great detail, concluding with her grievances. Like a lower animal, she was abused by poverty and her own man; like a lower animal, she abused her own child.</p>
<p>Whenever she innocently beat the child, who could not yet speak complete sentences, her neighbors, Mrs. Luo Si, Auntie Yu Gen, the shoemaker Chen Man, and the well digger Bi Tong, would come in and surround her, trying to persuade her with all sorts of words.</p>
<p>"What do you know? What do you know!" she would curse brazenly. "He's my own flesh and blood, and you want to interfere even if I hit him a few times! ... This yellow pest is not just here to collect debts, but to take my life. How would you understand?"</p>
<p>"Be careful, you're going to beat him to death," the well digger Bi Tong roared. "We won't allow it! —You're worse than a bitch!"</p>
<p>"Come on, whoever dares to lay a hand on me, come on!"</p>
<p>If she provoked her husband with these same words, that fiery man would teach her a lesson with his fists, "love" her, and heavily pound her back and chest, without saying a word to her. She would run out into the street, sit on the ground and shout for help, spitting out bright red blood from her mouth.</p>
<p>"Tell me my fortune," she once asked my friend Zhu Juexian.</p>
<p>"Women don't need to have their fortune told!" the fortune teller refused. "Your husband's fortune is your fortune."</p>

<h3 id="e211">Worse Than a Dog <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Another hotel has been established in Shanghai, but this hotel is not a hotel for people to have a drink, but a dog hotel for dogs to stay and eat. According to reports: Although the Shanghai Ge Road Hunting Dog School charges 50 yuan per month, there are still many hunting dogs being trained. In order to expand the scope, the owner of the school has recently opened a dog hotel, providing two meals a day, mainly beef, and charging 18 yuan per month for food. However, the school's hunting dogs have a monthly fee of 50 yuan, including food and accommodation, so there is no need to pay extra. Because the dog hotel is quite convenient, many Chinese and Western dog owners in the city have been taking their beloved dogs to the hotel to eat, which is very lively.</p>
<p>It is common to see wealthy people who keep dogs treat them with great care, regarding them as sons and daughters. They eat beef, sit in cars, and some even sleep with them in bed at night. Now this dog hotel is opened to meet this need. It is said that dog hotels are very common in major cities in Europe and the United States. The daily fee is very high, often more expensive than the meals of the working class. But the prosperity of the business is no less than that of human hotels. The one established on Haige Road is still an unprecedented initiative in China. In the future, it will be much more convenient for those who keep dogs at home. This is really the happiness of dogs!</p>
<p>But just when we were celebrating for the dogs, we heard the news of a family working together to rob food and clothing, which was very disappointing. This incident happened in various places in the Nanshi Old City. A group of poor people with bird-like faces gathered dozens of people into a group and grabbed steamed buns, pancakes, and other things from dim sum shops along the way to fill their stomachs. None were spared. Occasionally, when the police arrived, the food had already entered their stomachs, and the shop owner could only cry out in vain. There was also a certain tailor who hired a rickshaw the other day to load 300 sets of finished cotton trousers, intending to transport them to a foreign goods store for delivery. Unexpectedly, after passing Xiaobeimen, a group of ragged people rushed forward and robbed six cotton trousers. By the time the police arrived, they had already escaped without a trace. This is the misfortune of human beings!</p>
<p>As far as we know, a catered meal in Shanghai only costs six or seven yuan per month per person. Sending an infant to a nursery also only costs twelve yuan per person per month. Now this dog hotel provides two meals a day, and the daily fee is eighteen yuan, which is much higher than the living standard of people. Moreover, dogs have the good fortune to enter hotels, but people need to risk robbery to get food and clothing! In comparison, how can one not sigh: It's worse than a dog!</p>
<p>However, the people mentioned here refer to the poor, which is not the case for the rich. For example, recently the thermometer has gradually dropped, and some poor people who have no food and clothing have already starved to death and frozen to death! Another part of the rich are eating bird's nest and cod liver oil in warm, spring-like rooms, waiting to watch the snow! "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine are left to rot, while on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death." These two sentences are the best portrayal of this phenomenon!</p>
<h3 id="e212">Snow <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is said to be a place in Jiangnan, it is not as good as the Lingbiao area in the south. There is no snow in winter. Wouldn't its face be so dry that people feel uncomfortable? In winter over there, although you can hear the howling north wind sweeping past outside the window, you can also see the green and yellow leaves of the trees. You can think of it as autumn in Jiangnan to comfort yourself, but when you look up and see the color of the clouds painted on the corner of the building, it will make the bright autumn feeling in your heart disappear.</p>
<p>Now you can rest assured, you don't have to worry about it anymore. When will the snow fall? It would be embarrassing to say it out loud. Of course, if you live in the north, this thought would not have to be hanging in your throat until now. It has long snowed in the north, and some rivers and seas have even frozen, and boats cannot travel. What you see and feel is just the freezing and cold all over the sky! Isn't that kind of scene the face of winter? Shanghai belongs to the southern region after all, so winter naturally comes later; however, in the past few days, hasn't the mercury on the Celsius thermometer dropped to twenty degrees or so? Look at the sky without the sun, the accumulated frozen clouds, snowfall will not be delayed beyond two days. As long as it rains tonight or tomorrow morning, you can see snowflakes flying all over the sky, and then cover the earth in a white expanse! At that time, several inches of snow will pile up thickly on the steps of your home, making you love it and unwilling to step on its whiteness with muddy shoes and spoil it. You should be satisfied and happy, you are surprised, you jump for joy, wishing you could also differentiate into white snowflakes, flying in the sky, floating in the sky, and then quietly covering the branches and grass; when the sun comes, it will reflect dazzling light, beauty does not lack solemnity. Then it will gently dissolve into droplets of water, moisturizing the seeds of flowers and plants buried underground. Isn't such a dream gorgeous and splendid enough?</p>
<p>However, you also have to find a way to dissipate and grind away this beautiful snowy day. Snowball fights and snowmen are all things that children play with, and you may not feel interested. Treading through the snow to find plum blossoms is a bit too elegant, and you also have to be able to find plum blossoms nearby. Shanghai has asphalt roads, and there are no mountains to speak of. Even if you can't find plum blossoms in the garden of the mansion, but not everyone may have a garden like the Grand View Garden. People in the garden can only look over the wall (maybe you can't even see it). Of course, if you are interested, it is not impossible to take the train to Dengwei, Suzhou. No one will interfere with you in such a bad mood. It's just that this way of playing is not something that everyone can do. Then how about seeking the next best thing? You always have friends. When it snows, you may wish to send a small invitation to invite them to come, roast by the fire, warm the pot with hot wine, and everyone have a round-the-stove meeting to talk about the past and present of the world, but you don't have to force people to write poetry. This is the cliché of celebrities and can be left to them. It's a pity that you can't buy venison in Shanghai, otherwise you can also imitate the story of Shi Xiangyun and Jia Baoyu roasting venison alive at the Luxue Pavilion. The taste is guaranteed to be rich, fragrant, and wild!</p>
<p>You have muddled through the daytime, maybe you are tired. Naturally, you won't think about going out at night. If you go to bed too early, you may not be able to fall asleep on the bed (if you have a wife, naturally it's up to you at this time, excuse me, I don't have a wife yet, I can't say this taste). At this time, it is best to learn from the ancients, the joy of "reading banned books behind closed doors on a snowy night." That kind of fun can only be felt by you personally, and words are difficult to describe. The scope of banned books mentioned here is very broad, and it does not necessarily refer to obscene books. You think there is wind and snow outside, who else will come to be an uninvited guest and knock on your door at this late hour? You can read to your heart's content and have a great time. Is there anything happier in life than this?</p>
<p>In short, snow can make you happy, make you happy, make you forget the cold, and give you a gorgeous and splendid dream. I don't want you to be a celebrity or an elegant person. It doesn't matter if you are as unrestrained as possible when you are bold. But don't be pretentious.</p>
<p>Wait, the snow will always fall.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Old Man Who Traps Coots <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>After three consecutive nights of northwesterly winds, the weather has become quite cold. The old mulberry trees, which still had some remaining leaves a month ago, are now bare, revealing a landscape of deathly grey, devoid of any vitality from nature.</p>
<p>Ye Ya San (Wild Duck Three) turned over in bed and saw a faint light seeping through the cracks in the tiles. He jumped out of bed, draped himself in an old cotton-padded coat as old as he was, and reached out to push open the wooden window. A sharp gust of cold wind rushed in, causing him to shrink his neck into his collar and instinctively shiver! He walked out of the room, hung a tobacco basket on his arm, shouldered his oar in the doorway, closed the broken white wooden doors through which wild dogs could squeeze in and out, and locked the rusty iron ring. He crossed the small bridge, pulled his rolled-brim felt hat down tightly, tightened his waist, braved the biting wind, and headed towards the riverbank.</p>
<p>The wind swirled powerfully in the air, causing the bare tree trunks to bow repeatedly. A thick layer of frost covered the withered grass, as white as if it had snowed last night. He climbed down into the broken little boat tied to the short sandalwood tree on the riverbank, placed the oar, tucked the tobacco basket under the bow, and then used a sorghum broom without a handle to wipe away the frost from the boat's beam.</p>
<p>"I wonder which little devil cut the boat rope!" When he went to untie the rope, he discovered that half of the thick hemp rope had been cut with two knife marks.</p>
<p>The small boat drifted towards the Sandbar at Temple Mountain, gradually drifting into West Tai Lake. The wind whipped up white waves, crashing head-on into the boat, causing the hull to struggle and race like a runaway horse in the boundless, treacherous waves. Ye Ya San gripped the oar, gritted his teeth, and trembled at the stern. The waves crashed against the boat, splashing him with water, soaking his tattered cotton-padded coat.</p>
<p>The sun followed the small boat, climbing out of the depression and slowly rising into the sky. But as soon as it emerged from the mountain hollow, the sunlight was diluted by the wind, pale like the face of a lung patient, so dejected and defeated, as if deliberately mocking Ye Ya San, appearing and disappearing in the clouds.</p>
<p>He rowed the boat past Three Mountains Dam and saw a patch of withered grey reeds in the distance. He quickly rowed a few more strokes, and the boat reached the edge of the reeds. He warmed his hands, which were frozen as if his fingers had been amputated, and he felt a bit numb.</p>
<p>He steered the boat close to the reeds, remembered where he had set the "fairy trap" yesterday, and began to collect them, one, two, three...</p>
<p>"Eh! Why isn't a single one set off? Could it be that no one came even in such cold weather yesterday?" He thought to himself, feeling a little disappointed!</p>
<p>Last night, he had placed a total of twenty bamboo bows here, but eighteen were empty, capturing only two wild ducks, both male coots. He threw all the ropes and bamboo bows into the cabin, sighed, and sat on the boat's beam to smoke.</p>
<p>The reeds rustled in the wind, the sound so desolate and mournful that it sounded to his ears like countless people weeping for hunger and cold, and it seemed as if he could even hear the voices of his mother, wife, and children.</p>
<p>Dejectedly, he rowed the boat out of the reeds and headed towards Luanmen, but at this time the wind was even stronger than before, the sun had hidden itself, the sky was painted with a heavy leaden color, and the earth had turned grey and dark, as if about to collapse. At the same time, Ye Ya San's heart felt as heavy as if it had been filled with lead, and his mind was as dark as if it had been covered with grey paper—</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Oppressive City Sky <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>Once you come to the city, even the gifts of nature that you enjoy in the countryside are stripped away. In a cramped attic room, you can't see a single ray of sunlight all day long. When you open the window and look out, you are met with three sides of sheer, grey walls, blocking your view. The small room is like being stuck in a deep well. Even when you look up at the sky, it's only a somber, narrow corner, completely losing its original lofty and bright appearance. At night, there is no moon, no stars, only boundless darkness.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, people feel suffocated and gloomy. If it's also drizzling outside, then such a mood is most unbearable.</p>
<p>For the past few days, the sky has been overcast, like a sheet of lead. Even at midday, the sky looks almost like dusk. The electric lights that are on all day long, with their dim, yellow light, only add to the depression in one's heart. Sitting isn't right, standing isn't right, so you can only watch the swirling rain threads by the window, but that still can't cover up the loneliness in your heart. At night, the dripping rain sounds even more desolate, and as the drops fall on the bed, you think about completely vague things, vague things that you don't even know why they float to the surface of your mind.</p>
<p>On the way home, I encountered rain again. Standing under the glass eaves of a store to take shelter, I quietly watched the crowds of people coming and going like dark clouds. Most of them were hunched over, walking at an angle, and the neon lights reflected on the puddles on the asphalt road like winding red snakes. The tram was like a giant beast crawling out of the water, and the streetlights were like giant eyes filled with tears, coldly hanging over the city streets in the rain. Although this was the first time I had encountered this scene, I extremely detested it, so decadent and embarrassing!</p>
<p>The genius French painter Van Gogh once said, "Thinking about the sun in the south in a rainy hometown makes one weary." I deeply experience the feelings of this wandering artist.</p>
<p>Originally, it should be the season for snowfall now, but it's still drizzling day after day, night after night, how annoying the weather is! I like the purity of snow, and even more, I like the sun. It warms me, inspires me, and gives me light, but the darkness covers it, throwing us into the abyss. When will we see the sun? At this moment, I couldn't help but pray like this.</p>

<p>Xu Mei Sent a Poem: After Reading, Left My Eyebrows Raised</p>
<p>A chance encounter in a spring boudoir, exceeding expectations. At first sight, I doubted it was a dream, and we sadly asked each other about our years. This feeling is almost like that again. At that time, official matters urged me on, and I regret not being able to chat freely. At the beginning of summer, I planned to accompany my host to visit my hometown, but you had already set sail for Lu River. Returning after the Dragon Boat Festival, I unfolded and read your letter. Your thoughts and feelings were earnest and sincere, recounting your current situation and recalling the past joys, which made me even more emotional. You have accumulated much learning and literature, and I have long planned to be among the literati in the capital. It is certainly better to be at the tail of an ox than at the head of a chicken. As for the current situation of private tutoring, it is generally the same. A blue carpet (job) can last a long time or not, only you can judge the times and handle it well. I have been travelling for many years. My aging mother leans on the door every day, longing for my return. But because I am empty-handed, I cannot return. The heroic spirit of the past has gradually faded away in the tedious and melancholy world. I send you these four recent poems, and you may be surprised by their decline.</p>

<p>Opening passage: "Dream of the Red Chamber: Qingwen is Expelled"</p>
<p>Charming and captivating Qingwen, diligently serving in the Yi Hong Courtyard. It is hateful, that Mother Wang Shanbao slanders her. Saying that, Qingwen is clever and delicate. She is, a cherry-mouthed girl with a sharp tongue, presumptuous and accustomed to bullying people. The Madam hears, and believes it to be true. Thinking of the past, she is filled with anger. She scolds, "That hussy is too flirtatious and light-boned. Could it be, that I saw her in the garden that day, with her snake waist, narrow shoulders, and sly, slippery eyes? Moreover, 'satisfied with warmth, one thinks of lust' is an old saying. It's hard to guarantee that Baoyu won't be seduced." Thinking of the future, she feels concerned. She immediately orders a maid to summon Qingwen. Qingwen is, suffering from an illness and feeling upset, lying weakly in bed alone with her quilt. Hearing the maid's summons, she trembles with fear. She has no choice but to throw off the covers, put on her clothes, and force herself to get up. The Madam sees, and her heart is filled with hatred. Seeing her, with her hairpin half-askew and her temples half-loose, she says, "What a 'sickly beauty of the West.' I see that you are frivolous and not a good person. I have heard all about your actions. I will report to the Grand Madam and expel you, you demon!" Pitiful Qingwen, although she has a hundred mouths, she cannot defend herself. Her heart is filled with resentment and tears stain her lapel. She is, intelligent and aware of the plot within. She realizes that someone is secretly plotting against her. She covers her face and cries as she goes to the garden. She staggers, her footsteps faltering. Thinking, in the past I was favored by Baoyu, but who knew, mending the coat was still in vain. Grieved all day, her illness worsens. Not a drop of rice can she swallow. With unkempt hair and a dirty face, she is emaciated. A fierce old woman drags her out the door. Slowly, her lingering illness draws her near the Yellow Springs.</p>

<p>Opening passage: "Admonition Against Gambling and Prostitution"</p>
<p>The golden age passes quickly. The first thing is to be a good person. To say being a good person is easy. It's just, good words on the lips. From ancient times, sages were self-made. Don't, do things too lightly when you are young. The best thing is to be loyal and filial. Then you can, manage the country and the family on your own. Wearing cloth and eating vegetables is warm and fragrant. How can you damage your integrity and human feelings? No matter if you are poor or rich, just seek to accumulate virtue and the world will prosper with you. When doing business, you must be upright. Don't be greedy for flowers and infatuated with crabapple. Time is short, life is long. How can life be a hundred years long? Pleasure a moment, and you damage your reputation. I advise you, don't think about climbing over the wall to someone else's house. You must know, that the beauty of poverty is determined in a past life. Selfish desires will only bring you suffering. It is better to avoid it beforehand than to regret it later. Young men must think carefully. You must see that gambling leads to theft, and adultery leads to murder. A single misstep,</p>

<p>you will break the law. How many people have lost their families and fortunes? Don't enter gambling dens. Don't go to brothels. It is easy to fall. You must be careful. If you suffer from sores and poison, then, you will infect your wife and children. Gambling and prostitution are both dangerous. Don't let your parents cry at home. You must be careful in your daily friendships. Otherwise, you will be influenced. First, read books and learn etiquette. You must be able to distinguish good from bad. It is not easy to wash away regrets. Guests, don't forget my words. For the next few days, you will be safe, peaceful, and happy.</p>

<p>"Triumphant Return" has a luxurious parade scene, with banners covering the sky and stretching for miles. Dragon formations, lion formations, bamboo bands, stilt walkers, all kinds of shapes and colors, creating an unprecedented lively scene.</p>
<p>"Triumphant Return" has a magnificent dam opening scene, with a grand setting, tense atmosphere, numerous actors, and tragic performance, comparable to "Long Live Freedom."</p>
<p>"Triumphant Return" has a scene of waterwheels lined up in a formation. Thirty to forty waterwheels are seen connected together, the sound of the leaves is like a bell, and the water splashes everywhere. The magnificence of the scene and the beauty of the picture have never been seen in Chinese and Western films.</p>
<p>"Triumphant Return" has a vast farmland scene, with thousands of farmers fighting each other for water, the scene is very tragic, and the atmosphere is extremely serious. It is a realistic painting of the countryside, a page of the peasant's bloody history.</p>
<p>"Triumphant Return" has a solemn and magnificent Dragon King Temple scene, where several scenes of conflict between new and old ideas, the struggle of old forces, the tension of the situation, and the seriousness of the situation are fully demonstrated, revealing the darkness of rural society and the crisis lurking among young farmers that is about to erupt.</p>

<p>After Tian Laoda's Chinese Stage Association failed in Nanjing, the generals have dispersed. Even Mr. Hong Shen has gone to Qingdao after seeing Dongfang Mei Huisi and Bai Yushuang's bouncing opera in Shanghai. It is said that only Zhou Maiban Boxun, who knows how to repay kindness, remains by his side. A few days ago, Zhou Maiban even sent someone to Diantong to retrieve some historical plays to follow. It is unlikely that he will return to Shanghai until two or three weeks later.</p>
<p>What is Zhou Boxun doing in Nanjing? Some say: He is probably preparing to help Tian Laoda fight the second battle, right?</p>
<p>Last time, Zhou Zhenxun came to Shanghai to invite people. Before he could, the masses of the boss had rebelled, causing Zhou Maiban to curse the ungrateful people and return to Nanjing. This time, I wonder what tricks will be played.</p>
<p>Tan Ying and Cheng Bugao will jointly host a dinner. The date is probably within this week, and the location is said to be at the Star Second Factory. The reason for the dinner is unknown, and I will report it after I understand it.</p>
<p>It is said that after Ying "went bankrupt", Cheng Bugao sent out red eggs (is it related to Tan Ying? I don't know). Moreover, it is said that he also invited Yao Jie to a meal. Now they are hosting a joint dinner. I wonder if it is related to the above-mentioned events!</p>

<p>The sensational domestic song and dance blockbuster "Peach Blossom Dream" is produced by Shanghai Film Company, directed by Du Yu, written by Zheng Yimei, and stars the famous actresses Yin Mingzhu, Cang Yinxi, Ying Yin, and Lei Mengna. All the famous Chinese dancers and singers joined the performance, creating a scene of extreme beauty and extravagance. The comedian Dr. Li Amao (ie Xu Zhuodai) also plays a key role in the film, with his humorous and突梯 performance making people laugh. The film's scenes are lively, colorful, and extremely beautiful. The photography and sound recording are also perfect, making it the only successful song and dance masterpiece in Chinese films. The film is currently being shown at the Jincheng Grand Theatre on Beijing Road.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Miscellaneous News About the Revival of "The Government Inspector" <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>"The Government Inspector" was previously performed at Jincheng, and many people regretted not being able to see it. It will be revived at the Central Grand Theatre, with ticket prices reduced to three, five, and eight 角. The dates are the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of this month. This is also good news for theater fans.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the script of "The Government Inspector" has been revised for the revival. However, according to reporters, this is not true. However, the positions of the supporting actors have been completely rearranged, the long stage has been removed, and more gimmicks have been added to wash away the dull atmosphere.</p>
<p>Director of the Postal Bureau Gu Menghu went to Beijing on official business. It is said that he has sent a telegram to invite him. If he cannot spare time from his official duties, he will appoint Shan Xuliang to act on his behalf.</p>
<p>The rehearsal time for this revival is the 19th, 20th, and 21st. To save time, it has been decided to change the previous method of rehearsing by act to rehearsing by scene to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Yin Xiucen, Jin Shan, Li Dizhi, and Zhu Mingxian have been busy filming in various places recently, but they are still very enthusiastic about the performance of "The Government Inspector". They have been urging the rehearsal by telephone every day.</p>
<p>Local gentlemen Pi Buqing and Liu Mang are busy with important matters and cannot participate in the revival. They have specially hired Mr. Xu Tao, an old stage actor who has directed many plays, to play this role. Xu is as thin as a skeleton and is short, making him a suitable and enjoyable candidate.</p>
<p>Wang Ying recently bought a Japanese heating stove. She sits on the floor every day, carefully studying the script by the stove. She once said to people that this kind of life is an ideal life.</p>
<p>In winter, some are lucky and some are not. County Governor Gu Eryi almost died of gas poisoning at home the other day. After waking up, he boasted to people that because "The Government Inspector" had not yet been revived, he did not die resolutely.</p>
<p>Lan Ping recently suffered from a cold. Because the revival is imminent, others are quite anxious. Lan always gets sick before each performance, but as soon as the performance officially starts, she always recovers quickly. Therefore, she herself is quite relieved, and often says it's okay, it's okay.</p>
