<h3 id="c9">籌碼增加與套利交易 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>自新幣制政策實行以來。經中中交三行之同業透支。工商業貸欵審查委員會之信用放欵。及各業之推行商業承兌匯票。此月餘間。本市籌碼增加。市面有頓見活潑之說。誠如斯言。則可喜之現象也。蓋銀行結賬期近。放欵雖仍不銘緊縮。但有三行主持於上。當無去年之窘迫。而金融調度得宜。用以紓百業之急。濟産業之窮。振衰起敝。發揚光大。一俟渡過總結賬期。市面當有發展之望矣。</p>
<p>雖然。當農村初告破産之秋。鄉間資金。巳向上海移動集中。其時拆息未嘗不低落。資金未嘗不擁擠。但見地産交易之投機日盛。套利買賣之得步進步。故由今之道。而無改往日之習。則籌碼增加。仍無補於工商業之艱難。即使高利之債券。力能收回。亦難保利息之必可減低。蓋金融界投機家之套利生意巳成習慣。如標金外匯行市歸於平定。彼等即轉其目光於證券。至證券行市由絢爛而回於平淡。乃又展其手腕於紗花粉麥。夫金融界不以其金錢周轉市面。發展工商。而乃用以套利。在彼或以爲營利最穩妥之辦法。既出高利吸收存欵。不得不求相當之取償。但在工商業方面。則大受其影響矣。一則受高利之壓迫而劇本加重。再則資金擱積於套利而周轉不便。三則貨物積存於倉庫。而銷售不活或謂利息減低。可無此弊。不知套利生意之利益較優。期間亦短。人自爭趨之。救濟之道。如規定交易所期貨買賣。到期均須以貨物交割。不准轉賣買回。既爲事實上所不許。自惟有促金融界之反省。痛下功夫。實殘其扶助工商之職責。政府當局似亦宜從旁監督。無使籌碼增加。不能用以生利。而徒用諸分利也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日下院對於英法和平方案表示焦慮、故向英相鮑爾溫紛紛詰問、工黨戴爾頓請首相陳說此和平方案、鮑答稱、昨日辯論中渠已言之、今日所以復加、人人極盼擔案內容之公佈者、以渠為最甚、但此權不操於英政府之手、故目前不能發表此項提案云、鮑爾溫又稱、在艾登未抵日內瓦時、吾人不能預言將辦理此事者究為國聯五國委員會、抑為十八國委員會云、自由黨海立斯請首相担保、凡意阿爭執之解决辦法、如破壞阿國士地完整或商業獨立、則英政府苟未得阿政府之同意、不得核准之、首相答稱、外相霍爾十二月五日曾宣布英政府對於意阿爭議之政策、聲明凡從討論而得之任何方案、必須為意阿國聯三方面所可承認者、此種政策、艾登在昨日辯論中亦一再聲明之云、或問如意國攻舉英國艦隊則法國是否對於英艦隊予以援助、首相答稱、關於此事之英法政府文伴、此時若公布之、殊非公共之利益云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參議員波拉今日抨擊英法和平方案、謂英法所將給予墨索尼里者、較墨氏最初所求者為多、墨氏今後將為歐洲最有權力之人物、如此種方案果見實施、則國聯將成帝國主義之工具、美國在意阿爭議中堅守中立地位、誠屬幸事云、（十一日路透電）</p>

<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>引言　「電氣世界」這個名詞，我們已經聽得夠熟了。有人說歐美及日本列強的工業，所以能興盛，大半因爲電氣事業巳臻充分發展的境地，可見「電氣與工業」，實是不可分享的東西，擴大點說，電氣爲一切建設事業之母，承認了這句話，便聯想到我們中國的電氣事業來了。可憐得很，中國實在太落後，除了少數機器工業在使用電氣，大部手工業、倒還不是依然用人力畜力在掙扎着？而一切電器的來源，還不是仰給於外國？近年來纔有幾家商辦的電器廠，正在努力奮鬥，爭回若干損失的權利，其中自以「華生」爲巨擘。本報爲使國人明瞭其內容，特派記者等前往參觀，並介紹華生的詳情如次：</p>
<p>（一）參觀華生的經過</p>
<p>先是本報與葉友才先生約定本月九日上午爲參觀時間，到期記者和金華亭君趨車往福建路華生總管理處，知葉先生適以緊要公務出門，特派盧仲咸徐喬其兩君招待。據說華生分廠，在上海有六處，南翔也有分廠四。上海方面，着重製造電扇，南翔分廠，完全製造各式電器，我們爲了時間關係，決定先看周家嘴路的第一廠（老廠）及第二廠（新廠），再往南翔。計劃定當後、四人分駕兩車出發，這兩廠參觀畢，巳十二時許，即馳往南翔，先在電器公司午膳，公司名「生明」，亦爲華生所經營。席間談話，多半關於「華生」過雲與現在的善，餐後連續參觀四分廠，直至三時半，纔原車返滬。此番最使我們興奮的，便是二十年來的「華生」，從小小工塲十萬元資本開始，召集巳擴充至十個分廠，一百五十萬元的資金，出品由電錶一項而增造各種電器，銷路由上海一埠而遠於全國及南洋羣島，職工由十數人以至五百餘人；在內憂外患的中國境內，竟發展到如此程度，那我們不能不佩服葉友才，袁宗耀，楊濟川三位先生的有，有精神；能合作，能奮鬥的苦心了。</p>
<p>（二）華生電器廠史略</p>
<p>當民國五年，葉友才，袁宗耀，楊濟川三位先生目睹外貨充斥，利權外溢，幾以億萬計，深深地疾首痛心，抱定堅決意旨，摒秉原有職業，犧牲個人權利，探索電學趔，研究電器事業，毅然發起籌備，在北四川路橫浜橋畔，質屋數楹，雇工六七人，略專組織，定名爲華生電器製造廠。專造小件電器，如限制表，電流表，電壓表，及各式開關等。當時尚有技術人才，都由三痊親自操作，不到半年，出品銷售，逐漸發達。於是添加母機，增加工友，移到兆豐路，範圍稍大，乃添製發電機，因出品精良，大受社會歡迎。至民國八年，於周家嘴路自造廠房，向外國購重要母機。至民國十五年，工友增至三百餘人，添機至一百餘部，內部力求完善，增造各式電扇，行銷海內外，日形發達。十八年採行科學管理法。二十年在真如購地百餘畝，預爲建築總廠開關華生新村，職工住所，公共禮堂，俱樂部，合作社之用。二十二年創電氣廠，馬達廠，螺絲廠、鑄鐵廠於南翔。二十三年組總管理處，遷至福建路，內部組織，分科辦理，各司其事，各盡其職，這是華生二十年經過的概略。</p>
<p>（三）各廠出品的一班</p>
<p>華生電器廠在上海共分六廠：如在周家嘴路有二處，中山路一處，康腦脫路一處，小沙渡路一處，檳榔路一處，以上六處，完全製造電扇，—吊扇與檯扇，這兩種電扇每天天凝地閉可造二百隻。南翔方面，共分四廠：（一）分廠式、箱式、車式、檯式四種）變壓器，電表、斷路器，避雷呂、電焊機，及家用電具。年來國內各處工廠，定造電器，及鐵路局定製火車風扇的，爲數甚多。（二）華成馬達廠，專造發電機，最小的馬力，自四分之一匹起，以至五十匹，一百匹的，大小都有。內分交流發電機，直流發電機及礪磁機等，每天可造發電機十具。在以前國人不能自製，全賴外貨供給，定價高貴，購置不易。自從「華生」自造之後，外貨的銷路漸少，定價減低了將近半數，而且國人能造馬達的，此刻還不止華生一家。（三）聯成螺絲廠，專造各式銅鐵機器螺絲，大小代客製造，聞每天可出貨二百桶。（四）華聯鑄鐵廠。（五）生明電氣廠，爲以上四廠電力供給的地方。</p>
<p>（四）電扇的原料及製法</p>
<p>我們在周家嘴路兩分廠時，曾祥細攷察製造電扇的方法，知道一架電扇的成功，要經過十一部工程，五百餘次的手續，譬如銅葉子一項，先由整張的銅皮，分成一條條，打成葉子，磨光，抛光，噴漆，油漆，打蠟，以至裝配，至少在十次手續以上。所以無論吊扇檯扇，都要經過十一部工程：（一）製模（二）冲片（三）冲殻（四）吸鐵（五）油漆（六）繞線（七）吊裝（八）檯裝（九）葉罩（十）頭子馬達（十一）木葉。這好比一粒榖，不知要流了幾許汗血，纔能長成。現在提到「華生電扇」四個字，准都承認是上等國貨，出品確是精良。他的電扇，分作最快，次快，慢三等，有五十六寸，三十六寸四翼交流及直流吊扇，三十六寸三翼吊扇，還有十二寸及十六寸的交流與直流的檯壁兩用搖頭扇，據說明年度又有兩項新用品，是國人最新發明，巳得實業部五年專利權的。（一）新式吊扇，橫面扇風，可使吊扇下的四周，都有涼風拂面；（二）新式檯扇，變爲四面環轉式；比現時角度式的三面扇風，自然有顯着的進步了。至於電扇的原料，「華生」方面儘先採用國貨，如不得巳而用外貨，也只買粗料，而完全自製，像吊扇的葉子板，全球只有芬蘭國一種，線球，線圈，是英德兩國貨，檯扇的銅葉，也是英貨，此外鐵，漆，呢，那三種是國貨，所以電扇還算是二等國貨呢。</p>
<p>（五）職工的訓練與待遇</p>
<p>華生廠全部職員約百人，工人四百餘，自民國十八年實行科學管理法以後，職工團結一致，努力生産，訓練方面，南翔分廠比較注意，如早晨有早操，業餘有體育消防的團體訓練，晚間有夜校，不時有電學的講演，精神上都覺得很愉快的。廠旁工人住宅，還可以寄宿家眷，連飯食每月每人納費六元半，日常生活的設備，尚算完全。大概每天工資至少六角，多則兩元，在此不景氣的時期中，各處鬧着減薪欠薪的風潮，「華生」有此待遇，誠屬不可多得的了。</p>
<p>（六）華生的成功之路</p>
<p>記者參觀華生之後，對於他們整個兒通力合作的精神，用極經濟的方法，辦理很偉大的事業，表示欽佩之意。此外對中國的實業，復得到兩重認識：</p>
<p>第一：無論任何事業，不問其內行外行，只須刻苦研究，決無不成功之理。「華生」的三位創辦人，以前都經營其他業務，電學本非索習，全憑天才，探索真理，埋頭若干，終成不朽之業，堪青年的模範。</p>

<p>蜀夫人雖只寥寥數語，可是他們都知道事態的嚴懲，都飛一舥似的照她的話做去。不到十分鐘，裴先生和賴司務已經到了樹木子裏，拂朗騎着老恩台疾馳到大草原裏去遍索。蜀夫伺她去，別的人靜守在家，她又騎上了兔披，跑步而去，也尚有功夫戴帽或披上圍巾了。她聽到似乎有人在後面緊追着，可是她沒有說一句話，直到她停下來仔細一聽，她燈裏的亮光卻照在唐恩的臉上。</p>
<p>「你在這裏！我要解客來的，」她說時彷彿還要他回去，雖然她當時是急需人幫助的。</p>
<p>「我不願讓他去、他和愛彌還尚有吃過晚餐，我要來的心思比他們的的要濃厚，」他說道，便從她手裏接來了那盞燈，對她微笑，眼裏卻表示出一種果毅的精神，使她覺得，他雖然是個童子，可是現在在急難時她倒也有一個人可以依靠了。</p>
<p>她就一躍而下，命令他騎上兔披，他起頭要求許他走着，然而終於不能不從命；於是二人沿了灰塵蓬勃的僻徑一同走去，不時停下來叫喚一下，或者屏息一聽有無小聲音在回答著。</p>

<h3 id="c159">試解「中夏夜的一夢」 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 方土人</p>
<p>莎翁最有名的喜劇「中夏夜的一夢」，正在上海公映着，這是應該慶祝的一件事。以原劇譯者的資格，走出了國泰，將徘徊於三百餘年前英倫詩聖的夢境中所得到的實感，來作一解說，該是我當前應盡的任務罷。</p>
<p>詩人怎麽樣創造他這夢境呢？你們看</p>
<p>「詩人的眼，在微妙的狂亂中迴旋，</p>
<p>閃閃突射，從天到地，從地到天，</p>
<p>當幻想在實現</p>
<p>未知名的事物的形象，詩人的筆</p>
<p>便將它們化而爲具體的表現，給空中的太虛</p>
<p>一個居虎，一個名字。」</p>
<p>——原劇第五幕第一塲</p>
<p>看了這一段偉大詩人關於創作方法的自白，我們便很容易知道，由三支主綫交織而成的這「中夏夜的一夢」爲什麽這樣動人，並不是沒有原因的。詩人並不是在空中建築他的夢境，他是有他的磚瓦的。希臘波盧塔（Plularch）所著「提秀斯傳』（Life　of　Thesus，中譯見世界文庫第一冊），奧維得（Ovid）所著「變形記」（Metamorphoses第四卷中關於娣絲璧（Thisbe）和皮拉牧士（Pyramus）的傳奇，以及在詩人的故鄉窩立克州流傳着的關於小神仙的傳說，便都是詩人創造他這夢境時所用的磚瓦。這算抄襲嗎？絕對不是！詩人是「將它們化而爲具體的表現」呵。謙虛的詩人更藉原劇的收塲語，來表白他的創作態度：</p>
<p>『這散漫而無謂的主題，</p>
<p>僅僅產生一個夢而已矣，</p>
<p>可敬愛的，莫要求全賣備：</p>
<p>諸位如果寬恕，我們將要改善：</p>
<p>請你們大家拍手，如果我們是朋友，</p>
<p>將從新去刪修。』</p>
<p>詩人在這「中夏夜的一夢」中所運用的具象的創作方法，以及非常老實的創作態度，都很值得我們學習。</p>
<p>詩人在這「中夏夜的一夢」中，究竟夢見了什麼呢？夢境是建築在雅典，時代又是古希臘中的神話時代：詩人所故的夢，一定不是現實的夢罷。這種論斷，是可笑的。被尊爲現實主義詩人的莎七比亞，就是在這「中夏夜的一夢」中所夢見的，也都是最現實的。連桂冠詩人約翰。梅斯菲德（John　Masefield）評「中夏夜的一夢」時，也不得不承認「莎士比亞把握着英吉利精神上全部的力量。他作了一幅英吉利人物的大圖。」莎士比亞所刻劃的雅典公爵，乃是十七世紀英吉利貴族的典型；雅典工匠乃是十七世紀英吉利鄉村勞動者的典型；惡作劇的小神仙們，也都是英吉利鄉下人頭腦中間的現實的人物。「中夏夜的一夢」雖然披着雅典的外衣，裏在外衣裏面的肉體，却完全是英吉利的。這便是莎士比亞所以被尊爲現實主義詩人的理由。</p>
<p>詩人創造了這「中夏夜的一夢」，將呈獻給什麼人去呢？不管究竟是在那一年寫作的，這『中夏夜的一夢』乃是爲了慶賀一個新婚而寫作的——或者是爲了在或一巨室中的私演，也許正是爲了在朝庭中演奏，這一點雖然無從斷定，無論如何，此劇一定曾被呈獻於或一宮廷的婚禮，那却是毫無疑義的。可是，如果因此而論斷莎士比亞是一個卑鄙的宮廷詩人，『是一個寄生者，帶着亳不害羞的臉，仰仗他的封建上司的慷慨而生活』的劇作家，那也是機械的武斷。在以雅典工匠承歡雅典王侯爲基調的『中夏夜的一夢」中，詩人對他的聽衆在說明他那進步的世界觀。雅典工匠們的粗野的單純的眞摯，毫無惡意地和上流社會較有詩意的心情，互相結合如兄弟，使觀衆們看了，自然會感覺到有一種對全人類一視同仁的引力。下層的淳樸和上層的豁達，順利地揉和爲一了。</p>
<h3 id="c160">化妝岀現與便化 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>爲着使得讀者容易感動，做小說，常常把別人的故事當作新自經歷過的來描寫；因爲讀者對於作者，總已有了相當的認識和信仰，說是作者自己的事情，讀者容易表同情；而且，在「自傳體」中，語氣多是直接的，也是容易領會的。</p>
<p>有時却把自己的故事，常作別人的描寫，因爲有着同法律道德抵觸的地方，如果明白直說，將爲輿論所不容；或者應該保守秘密，不便公開。處在第三者的地位，寫成「正傳體，」（或稱他傳體，）才可以暢暢快快的妻現。</p>
<p>這樣把事情改頭換面，是「便化」的手段；形式雖然變更，「眞實性」仍然可以保持。自傳體與「自序傳」有別；自序傳也可以寫成正傳體。在文學上，便化是通常的手段，識者一目了然。</p>
<p>文學作品中，遝有把事情改變得更厲害的；根據「文學是苦悶的象徵」的理論解釋，就是「化妝出現。」</p>
<p>化妝出現的緣由大概有兩種：一，因爲不能够直接表達，只好借題發揮；譬如於元意中單戀着了個異性，愛慕得非常迫切，却碍於倫常習俗的關系，事實上不能够結合；「理知」不敢再存此想，「情感」可不肯就此放棄，仍然深深的懊念，形成「苦悶之團，」時刻想起來活動，一有機會，就抹殺固有的形態，寄託於相當的事實，藉以發洩。</p>
<p>二，有了深切的苦悶，却有點莫名其妙，因爲是元端的，生疏的，也是抽象的；要發洩，只好找得具體的事實來表現；醫如夢中被毒蛇咬傷，或者挨人打，醒後猶有餘痛，而且就在傷處生起瘡來出膿。原來生瘡的地方，早就中了毒，已經有着隱痛，只是日間忙亂，感不到；「下意識」却覺着了，所以乘機假借蛇咬挨打的固有觀念作爲具體的報告；這種化妝出現的情形在文學上是很多的。</p>
<p>无論是便化，或者化妝出現的結果，都是一種「象徵；」雖然改了頭，換了面，對於本體，却是比方着，代表着的。便化與化妝出現，兩者的功用相當，可是根本不同：便化由於作者的故意，是「技巧」的一種；化妝出現由於不知不覺，是可致不可求的。大概，由於便化的結果，只是「廣義的象徵；」由於化妝出現的結果，是「狹義的象徵，」才是文學上的所謂眞正的象徵。</p>
<p>在「純文學」上，本是狹義的象徵地位占得高；可是「人生的文學，」尚客觀，重理知，是更要利用便化的了，因爲這可以用力做到，化妝出現是難以捉摸的。</p>
<p>雖然可致不可求，化妝出現却是文學的本質之一。人生的文學重在問題的探討，但總得利用文學的本質，才容易感動讀者；否則只是理論，算不得文學了。所謂可致不可求，並非絕對做不到，只是來得緩慢。人生文學的作者，要利用化妝出現，得先以正當的理論爲前提，鍜鍊自己的人格，那末化妝出現的結果，會有偉大的氣象；——時刻以偉大的事業目期，化妝出現所假借的事情，自然也是偉大的了。否則聽其自然，情感原是盲目的，一下意識暗示」的結果，難免只是「花呀」「月呀」之類。一般文學作品中的「花」和「月」，雖然有的原也由於化妝出現，但有什麼意思呢？</p>

<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>一一九二八年一個夏天的淸麗的早晨，專做買賣人口生意的黑骨李舉從隔鄰的村子芙蓉尾跑到長壩這裏來。他穿着小路走，一會兒爬上崗頭，一會兒躲在山脚，好像他是一隻小船，在波浪上滑行着似的。</p>
<p>這時長壩剛剛在「洗村」——一種公開的搶刧和屠殺——之後，居民還是兩天前才從村外陸續跑回來收拾傢具和屍體。到處都丟下燒焦的木器和衣服，刺鼻的腥臭瀰漫着被蹂躪的山崗和燒掉的，砍掉的樹林，遠的或近的斜坡上冒出還未熄滅的白色的火烟。在廢物和垃圾之外，到處堆着熏枯的或新鮮的樹皮，——黑骨李舉每次經過這種地方，就留心着有沒有曝露的屍首，並且用手指揑着鼻子。在這回的「洗村」裏面，村長許大成被殺死了。……居民們沒有東西吃，就拿野籐菜，田灌草，混和着苦蓮蓬，野天冬燒起來吃，結果全部村民都患了很利害的腹瀉病。</p>
<p>在柯家邊那面朝東的山坡上，柯娣正跪在土牆旁邊稟神。</p>
<p>「紫微大帝呀，不說你都知道的了，我還是那一句，跟昨天晚上，昨天早上都一樣的：給點什麼吃的給我們吧！紫微大帝呀，不說你都知道的了………」</p>
<p>她虔誠地低聲地反覆禱告着。身體很瘦小，穿了破爛的全黑的粗布衣裳，她底辮子一條小蛇似地盤在背上，而她底全身縮作一團。差不多要倒場的土牆頹然地站在她身邊，什麽時候都有蓋下來把她完全埋葬了的可能。那時她只有十二歲</p>
<p>黑骨李舉和她底父親柯老四在病床前面猛烈地爭執着。因爲他要價太高，李舉就對他嘲笑起來。——柯娣沒有看見過她父親從前曾經那麼發過脾氣，那麼受過侮辱。她母親坐在一把鋤頭上不服禁止地嚎哭起來了。</p>
<p>「柯老四你呌做完全不知市價！小孩子在這個時候是送人的東西！……有人要了，你知道那孩子會比你多活幾天，也許居然養得大，你還該向別人道謝。——如果你是做夢我就讓你做：好孩子，十塊錢一歲，五塊錢一歲！——你儘管嚷你自己的！」</p>
<p>「一個小孩子只能賣一回，你這昏蛋！」柯老四駡他：「我現在是賣人。賣出門口她就永遠不會回來的。」</p>
<p>「凡是來找我李舉的都是賣人的。……如果出了門口又要常常回來，那呌做對親家！……我從來沒有做過媒人。」</p>
<p>「憑良心吧，你這死狗！人心是肉做。」</p>
<p>「那麽我對不起了……」</p>
<p>「不要走！」</p>
<p>柯老四大聲禁止他，然後對他說：</p>
<p>「好，你明明知道我不賣不行的！現在隨便你怎麽說都好，可是我底病好了之後，你當心我底斧頭砍斷你底頸骨！……」</p>
<p>「那麼我呢，難道要我底斧頭砍你底屍首麽？」</p>
<p>柯娣因爲害怕而悄悄地溜到門外去了。在雞欄前面，她重新跪下繼續她底禱告。</p>
<p>「紫微大帝呀，不說你都知道的了……」</p>
<p>山地上非常寂靜。疏落的砍伐樹木的斧聲和打樁在堅土裏的笨重的回響並沒有擾亂什麽東西。陽光像金色的湖水似地泛濫在這凹凸不平的朦朧的村落之上。當柯家最興盛的時候，他們亦鷄欄裏養過四隻花毛小鷄，現在那裏只剩下幾根橫斜地揷在黑土裏的短竹枝。</p>
<p>柯娣暫時停止了她底禱告，跟黑骨李舉一道永逮離開了她底鷄關，跑到山地以外的世界上去了。</p>

<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>五六年前——家鄉本來就是個寒村；但，感謝天！大家總還勉强生活在和平的空氣裏：放下鋤頭，人們還喝得起半兩燒酒，每年也照例有一兩次歡樂的迎神賽會；年輕人忘不了唱山歌，老頭兒也愛在嘴邊掛上三分笑意。</p>
<p>就在去年前年吧——雖然旱災招來了凍餓，兵禍帶來了嘆息和眼淚，眼前的哀愁早已趕跑了往日的歡愉；但總還算是個人間世：你還可以聽到犬吠，也還可以聽到鷄啼。</p>
<p>可是，今年呢——黃河的濁浪，正像一條饕餮的毒龍！牠吞掉了我們的茅屋，吞掉了我們的田地，還吞掉了我們的牲畜和兒女……</p>
<p>此刻，水總算退了，但我們的家園祗剩了一片荒地！荒地上——只有幾條沒淹死的瘦狗，在到處找尋牠們的舊居；只有無數的烏鴉爭啄着屍肉，在夕陽裏啞啞的啼……</p>
<h3 id="c163">過馬六甲海峽 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>從友人處借得一只舢板，一位熟識的夥友載我到海中。從中街出來，傍過「老吧噻」，大海在望，幾個月的塵囂和灰色而憂鬱的生活預備做個結束了。舢板傍近「吉打」輪的時候，夥友便說：</p>
<p>「去檳榔嶼不久便回來罷！中街有熱鬧的咖啡館呢。」</p>
<p>我點首微笑，知道我幾時再回到新加坡來呢？有飯吃，有工做，隨處都是家呀！否則我會再回到中街來的。中街有我的朋友，中街的出口處有海，中街的咖啡店中有各種各式的人，而中街有飯吃呀！</p>
<p>輪船從炎炎的太陽下開行。繞過了獅島一角，拋開了繁囂和擁擠的碼頭和貨棧。升旗山的旗幟低微了，馬路在島的轉角不見了。赤色的沙土在岸上小山中披露，赤裸裸的山頭不見黑石。船慢慢從二個低小的赤阜間穿過，浪花遠遠地擊着獅島的海岸。</p>
<p>船裏碰着一位行船的表親，他說：</p>
<p>「檳榔嶼并不此新加坡好呀。隨處都是失業的人；隨時都有怡保和霹靂一帶的鑛工由此出境。這「南國的花園」現在枯寂了。」</p>
<p>我說：</p>
<p>「花雖是枯了，也得看一下啊。枯萎的花叢中也許還有希望之花存在呢。」</p>
<p>翌日過馬六甲海峽。這緊縮的海峽中風平浪靜，海水的縐紋像風吹過池水一樣。偶然有海鷗，也偶然有帆船。此外大海從炎烈的太陽下反射出金光，捉魚人的漁舟遠遠地看不見</p>
<p>下午約三點鐘的時候，看見寂寞的大海中一只漁舟穿過。孤獨地，滿掛着風帆，船舷由柏油染得黑黑地。在船頭，遠遠地像一片葉子，然後，以帆船的原眞的姿態，從船尾寂寞地浮過了。</p>
<p>當着輪船小書記的表親告訴我：</p>
<p>「這一定是逋逃客，慣常在馬來與蘇門答臘間橫波的。漁人的舟子可沒有走得這麼遠，幷且悠閒閒地像跛仙過海呀！你看那船一擺一擺地！煞像一只跛脚的鴨子呢。」</p>
<p>我沒有說話。我奇怪馬六鉀海峽的海怎麼沒有海吼，沒有狂濤呢？平靜而溫良的海，可不是常態；我可不願意看平靜的海洋呀！</p>
<p>徬晚船從成列的秀山間抵達檳榔嶼。幾年的渴望旣已如願達到，看到叢林繁茂的熱帶靑山，馬六甲海峽便被輕輕地放過了。</p>

<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>也許是在家里收拾逃難的東西呢？總之，沒有偷看成功。母親和叔嬸她們，當然都喪氣極了。但是我呢，却歡喜得要命，先將那地上沒人管的花生，吃了許多，回來的時候，兩個小衣袋又幾乎裝得要炸裂了</p>
<p>在這逃難的三四天內，大人們許是着實吃過一驚吧？那是看見有一二十僩拿羊角义紅纓矛和大刀漢子，在門外走過大家便都一齊朝茅房那里躲去，並且呌我不要從稻草里面仲出頭來張望，等一會，聽說那些都是去帮同治會的，就又立刻笑着駡着鑽了出來。當時，我想，這不同我們小伴些做躲躲藏藏的「貓貓戲」一樣好玩麽？</p>
<p>後來回去，一記起這些有味的事情，我總要牽着媽的衣角邊，問道。。</p>
<p>「媽，糖子時候？我們才會再逃一次難呢？」</p>
<p>懂得逃難之苦的媽媽，就鼓起臉駡道：</p>
<p>「啥，你在倒楣了！…准問道些！」</p>
<p>後來在外面也逃了許多難，情形却像吃西洋丸藥一樣，外面裏的呸衣業已化去，全是剩下苦的辣的味道了。</p>
<h3 id="c165">新居 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>搬到這新居來，還不到一個月，就有朋友勸我移居。但我總是看着別人家搬塲汽車一輛輛向門前駛過，自己一天天延宕下去。朋友的意思，是可感的。然而他又哪里知道我別有想頭。</p>
<p>我並不愛這新居。所謂新居，也低有二間逼仄的樓面，聊可容膝而已，絕無一般人以爲可愛的條件。然而眞的要我搬走，我却不能無所留戀了。</p>
<p>這新居，在東體育會路，是臨近靶子塲的。但我初搬來的時候，並不知道這點。待我稍稍安頓下來，坐在窗下開卷讀書時，一陣辟辟拍拍的聲音嚇壞了我，我回頭往窗外望去，這才發現那聲音所從來的地方，是一堵蒼綠的土山，土山上一列赭色牆坦，牆垣下幾塊黑底自字！亞刺伯數字！的木牌，跟那貼木牌時時隨槍聲升起倒下的白紙片。全都歷歷如畫地展在我眼前。這才呌我恍然知道自己原來是身處靶子塲下。</p>
<p>誰將會不寒而慄吧！也許誰都會想到，這作爲殖民地人民的自己，有隨時當作這蒼綠的土山上一堵赭色的牆垣，一塊黑色的木牌，一張蒼白的紙片底危懼吧！然而我却一下子，就覺得這新居底合適了。生爲二十世紀的人，想沒有聽不慣這最激厲最偉大的音樂的！這靶子塲的打靶聲，實在是超人世的，找遍全世界也找不到的最高傲而美妙的音樂！</p>
<p>我也曾有一時期，靜聽過近代洋式建築物底內部的音樂。這情形，恰如日本作家烏木健作在他那小說癩中所寫的一般！</p>
<p>「他住着的二樓六十五號房間，在長廊下略靠中央…在這建築物一角起來的一切聲音，彷彿全會向中央自然地集凑攏來。雖然內部全有分隔，但在這大箱子一般的建築物一隅，一有什麼聲音，四壁就會起暗淡的反響。那反響向中央部流來，又漸漸流去。——通過廊下男子們草鞋底；摩擦聲三二個人偷避人眼，低低的說話聲；搬運車底軋礫聲；一天三飱拋飯盒子聲；看守們沉重的步履聲和佩劍底鏗鏘聲。—…這些雜然的聲音，一流到這里，便成爲某種和諧的音調。這是個嚴禁人世同伴者說話的世界，從早到晚，祗能看到灰色的壁和通過鐵格子窗而見到的靑天，但偏在這中間，却還有一個自然醞釀的音樂世界，帶來那麽個複雜的音色……」</p>
<p>這心境，想是現代靑年——在洋式建築物中靜守過若干時光的人所共有的吧！然而這是具有閒靜的音色的近代最美妙的音樂。跟我此刻耳邊所聽到的音樂相比較，可「適得其反」了。</p>
<p>那普樂開初是稀稀朗朗的幾聲。音調短促而圓熟。彷彿一羣野孩，在木葉黃落的秋林中，採取了一顆顆栗子，給投在火裏，發出「碰」或「篷」的爆響，接之以「嘩啦！」的輔音。呌我出感到一種山谷的幽趣。過後，這聲音連珠地。就是積雪壓竹，大風怒搖，竹莖爆裂，「發碰啦！碰啦！碰啦！」一連串響澈行雲。呌我興白雪遺音，曲高和寡之感。跟着，也許是沉寂了，靜空中流過風的歎息。也許是來一陣更激厲的更淸澈的更熱烈的聲響，則嚴然慶祝新年，鞭砲之聲歡然的昇平氣象了。而這是四周的人語聲，車輪聲，小販的呌賣聲，馬蹄的得得聲，孩子的啼聲，火車的汽笛聲，草尖的拂拂聲，落葉的沙沙聲，煤屑路上異國軍士齊整的步伐聲！全給它壓得低低的，脆弱而暗淡，凄切而蒼凉，然而却成爲這偉大而雄健的合奏底唯一的輔音。所以，說前一種音樂，是帶有閒靜的音色的；那麼這一種音樂，可說是帶有動力學的音色的了。前一種曾樂，往往爲蒼白臉的接近於死的人所愛聽的；而這一種音樂却是血氣方剛戒之在鬥的靑年所愛聽的。聽前一種音樂的結果，能使人沉沉睡去，漸至無聲無息，入湼槃境界。而聽這一種音樂的結果，則無有不使人血花飛濺，想染紅這全世界！我得處在這新居里，聽這一種天地間至偉且大的美妙的音樂，深切地呌我時時起一種關於人類的運命的反省，我眞要涕泗交流地感謝這古老的國土，我又何忍一時便搬移他去呢！</p>
<p>其次，依照在生活習慣，每早起來，總要稍稍活動一下身體。到這里後，我就在沿東體育會路散步。第二天早晨，我踱到一條大橋上。哦！在薄紗似的晨霧籠罩下，那兒有一所多麼優美閒靜的住宅呵！四面用竹籬圍着，竹籬上繞着蒼綠的藤蘿。中間有四五間兵房型的板屋。它那稷色的板面，全掩映在蒼翠紛披的藤，蘿，柳，桃的枝葉之間，宛如杜甫佳人詩篇里那種「牽蘿補茅屋」的幽閒情景。竹籬外畦畝釐分，雜亂地秤着蔬菜，菊花，桃，柳之類，疏疏密密，一任自然，彷彿未加人力。中有一塊圓地，用碎瓦片砌成，周圍種着拱把的稚柏。這時，太陽尚未上升，但凄霧却漸漸兒收起了。那小屋里喔喔的鷄聲，跟左隣的狗叫，高傲地相互唱和着，大有鷄狗亦成仙之致。一會兒，有一個中國同胞，短衣跣足，從小屋里端了一張方木桌出來，放在那碎瓦砌成的地壇上。他怳恍地站了一會，返身進去，又端了二把棕色藤椅出來。椅上各有棕色軟墊一個。他把那藤椅左右相對地擺定。殷勤地拂拭一會，又怳恍地漫立一會，才緩步進去。在他的行動上，全顯着中古田園時代的幽閒逸趣，跟這懶洋洋地緩緩而來的調子，適相配合。他進去後，不久，一個西裝的男子，趿着拖鞋出來了。他走不多路，就用左手遮額，仰望天色。天是一片的白雲！他然後舉起右手的報紙，看了一看。慢條斯理地，踱到那地壇上，一屁股攤在那藤椅上，緩緩地打了個呵欠，把報紙放在桌，揎了幾下拳，再打一個呵欠，然後坐定來，伏着桌子看報。待太陽吐出了一抹淡光，鷄犬之聲漸漸疏朗了又有一個古裝女子，外罩白圍襟，捧着一隻精美的茶盤，綽約地出來。她把盤里茶壺，端放在那男子面前，低低地彷彿說了些什麼，自己就在對面坐定。給男子斟上一杯茶，然後自己也斟上一杯，拿過一張報紙來，靜靜在看。這一對中年男女，就這麼個靜在這晨的自然的默語里了。——這呌我不禁想象到三代以上的事去。然而彷之於陶淵明的世外桃源，想來還「有過之無不及」吧！雖然這世界已經推進到二十世紀，但像這樣的中世紀的田園風味，閒適情調，却也是帶有狗抓地氈的蠻性底遺留，世界上被稱爲劣等民族的我們所羨慕的吧！</p>
<p>勸我搬移的朋友的好意，是可感的！但我是個二十世紀的人，我須養成愛聽這世紀末的偉大的音樂的習慣！我不忍一旦捨去我的新居！</p>

<p>— 章繼</p>
<p>在東菲意大利的飛機猛烈轟炸阿國無防禦的城市，和某國飛機不斷偵察平津聲中，我們讀到兩則比較可以興奮的消息：第一，華僑靑年許啟興，駕自製飛機由荷蘭本國飛爪哇往返告成後，益爲荷人所景仰；旋郎應荷人聘請，擬在爪哇籌設大規模飛機製造廠。許君並謂明春决請假駕自製機返祖國一行，圖得報國機遇。其次，歐亞航空公司總經理李景樅提倡飄翔運動，以爲初步飛行訓練，現正徵求黨國領袖，共同發起，擬在上海組織飄翔研習總會，將來並在各地設立分會。</p>
<p>我們知道：二十世紀是飛行的世界。自第一次大戰以後，各國對於航空事業，都竭力推進，到了今日，不特已成爲軍事上唯一的武器，就是在民用航空方面，也有極顯著的淮展，最扳美國的「中國號』橫渡太平洋成功，（其意義暫且不必管牠）便是一例。我國地域廣大，交通不便，民用航空的亟待發展，是無可懷疑的事，至於軍事方面，一二八的敎訓，不特上海人民還深印在腦際，便是全國人民，也是不能忘的，他的需要，正像民用一樣迫切。</p>
<p>提倡航空，固然應由政府爲通盤的計劃，但民間的航空熱，尤其重要。所謂航空熱，我以爲不僅在物質上應該踴躍輸將，便是在技術方面，也應有積極的訓練，如機械的構造，飛行的技術，防空的知識等，都是很重要的。飄翔運動，雖是初步的飛行訓練，而其含義，實爲重大；至於許君的自製飛機，其激發我們對航空的情緒，成功初不僅在技術方面。我希望由這兩則興奮的消息，推進我國幼稚的航空事業。</p>

<p>情感是海，我的身子恰如是載在海之上的般，隨着波流飄浮着，永遠沒有靜止，海，威情的海，也似海那麽遼遠地接連着望不見盡頭的天幕，深沉却又不可探底。海的變幻是跟氣候的變幻一樣不易捉摸的。感情的海也許更有着瞬息萬變的姿態，於是我這身子的船，常有覆沒在感情的海中的可能了。</p>
<p>驟然括起一陣風暴，海的浪濤彷彿山丘似的翻騰着，海的情戚的浪濤撞擊着身子的船，猛烈的搖撼起來，當這時候，我是鎭靜的，我聽憑命運去决定，因爲那遭逢總是不能避免的事，而且是沒有方法可以挽救，我準備着最後的身子的船的沉落。同時忘記了所有的一切。可是終于未曾沉落，但經受過若干次風的襲擊，波濤的襲擊之後，身子的船雖仍無破漏或穿洞，却已被推磨得異樣的衰老古舊了。</p>
<p>情感的海的動靜是難測量的，一下子咆哮起來，能够毀滅一切；一下子平息起來，則又運載着一切，而載在感情的海之上的身子的船，是有着我的生命，以及一些希冀，一些企圖的，亦和着一些恐怖，一些戰慄的，我時時担心無端的情戚的波濤會捲沒了身子的船，然而當它較久不見變動的時候，身子的船便忘却有所掛慮似的，悠然地，緩緩地行駛着，隱約之間好像存着一種甘心碰着險巇的經壓的好奇。</p>
<p>我正是一隻漂泊在情感的海心中的船。</p>

<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>朋友，流浪到遠處的古城裏去已經有一年了的，而今，却依舊拖着一個萎靡的身體與一對疲勞的眼睛，像一條影子那樣的，悄悄地回來了。</p>
<p>在一陣連音信都沒有機會通問的悠長的闊別之後，帶了一肚子的遠地的見聞與感受（却是多麽破碎的啊），好遠地來訪了我；於是，我們握了手，在一霎間立刻彼此體會到了對方的一種說不出的困苦與不安，我們都不自由主地沈默了下來，把預備好了的闊別後的間好的語句！全叫可怕的死寂底黑手給刦奪去了。</p>
<p>誰又能說什麽話，誰又能告訴誰一點可喜的話呢！我們是無抵抗地喪失了做作的問好的勇氣了的—從對方的疲勞的身體與憤恨的眼睛上，所看到的一樣是一堆生活的碎片啊！我們是都能够用自己的生活來說明別人的了。爲什麽又一定要人把不快意的破碎的斷片拉出來呢？—那是無用的，那是蠢的，那是多事而殘酷的。</p>
<p>可是，沈默着又沈默着，我終於說了：</p>
<p>「而今，你終於回來了。在古城裏生活了一年，古城的風光究竟是怎樣的呢？說一點吧。」</p>
<p>閃了閃眼睛，掉過了他底蒼白的臉，他輕聲地說了：「是的，我回來了。古城依舊是一樣的古城；可是，它已經不再是我們的世州界。」</p>
<p>聲音是那麽鎭靜，那麽低，低得甚至難以辨別得出它們底字句。可是，這些，輕輕地落進我們底耳朶裏，却像是一顆頂猛烈的炸彈，它們是有着大雷一樣的巨響，擊震了人心底的呢。</p>
<p>而嗡嗡的聲音依舊鎭靜得像荒山的岩石那樣地在繼續下去：「古城已經不再是我們底世界了。它已經不適於我們的生活，所以，便回來了。」</p>
<p>音調是鎭靜的，而這鎮靜的音調却急燥而兇暴地打在我底心上，像冰冷的冬夜的暴風雨，我震抖起來了：「這世界，將沒有一處是我們的了！它是將到處都沒有我們生存的餘地了，那是項困苦，項恥辱的時代的悲劇啊……」</p>
<p>沈默幾乎又要來佔住這小室的凄冷的空間了，我們都駭怕這噬人的沈默！於是，朋友開始動了動那蒼白而無體色的嘴唇，而吐出另外一些話說來了：「而你，你是怎樣在生活着的呢？你是怎樣把一天天的日子打發過去的呢？人是不能再去想起過往的日子的了—一年了啊。」</p>
<p>「是的，一年了啊，」我茫然了：一年了啊，而這一年來，生活是怎樣惡毒地刑罰了我，我將用怎樣的語句來告訴他呢？我將從那裏說起呢？生活是一堆被擊碎了破片，而這些破片是破殘得無法收拾得起來的，我說一點什麼好呢？</p>
<p>然而，我也終於說了：「喝，生活哪，是那麼糟的，它挺像一條拉不斷的毒的鞭子……」</p>
<p>「住了！住了！你別再往下說！你別再……」</p>
<p>他發狂一樣地叫了起來；於是，跟着這叫聲，我們又都沈默了，一條無形的鞭子靈活地在我們底身上跳着舞，盤旋着，揮動着……</p>
<p>夜是無聲息地落下了，小房間裏是烏黑得異常的可怕，冬天已經很深，外面呼呼地吹着風，我彷彿依舊聽得：「已經不是我們底世界了。」</p>
<p>朋友站起身來，點一點頭，無言地拖着一條細長的影子趕了出去，我跟着他，到門口，握一握手，便依舊緩慢地踏着冷淸的街，走去了。</p>
<p>望着他底背影，我那麽地說了一句「一年了啊。」</p>
<h3 id="c186">李三爹 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>太陽浮上東邊的林稍，辣毒的光芒，從小窗直射到地板上，晒在李三爹的赤裸的肚子裏，把他晒醒過來。</p>
<p>李三爹自恃他是一個老番，什麼習慣都和黑炭頭的土人一樣，用不着在太陽剛要探出頭來的大淸早起來「冲凉」，他時常對着那些新從「唐山」來的「新番」，裂關黑牙板的嘴巴，半含敎訓半含驕傲地說：「你們是新來的，大淸早不可貪睡，在太陽未出山之前，就得起來「冲涼」，——不怕冷，從頭頂直淋下去，多淋幾桶水，才不會害病，不服水土。——你們是不比我的，我，連地都踏暖了！哈哈新客仔」！</p>
<p>他一骨碌裏跳起來，走下土階，用兩隻手掌當成水瓠在蓄水的木桶裏捧出水來，撲到臉上去，這樣就算洗過臉了。於是，在褲頭裏掬出一個值五分錢的「式丹」（暹羅的錢幣）來。向蹲在門口的土人買一包竹葉飯，吃着，就算是早餐了。然後，提起竹棟，走出了低矮的離笆門。</p>
<p>距籬笆門不遠，是一段土坡，土坡上兀立着很多高大的棕櫚樹，葉密密地鋪着，綠油油的；底下蹲着一間低矮的亞答屋，這便是之興老二的酒店，雖則招牌斑剝的認不淸上面的字，然而住在這裏的人，誰都知道「興記酒莊」，一家最老牌的酒店呵！</p>
<p>李三爹望了興記酒莊，喉頭就有點兒癢癢了。他心裏想，有半斤白乾來喝一喝，是多麼的有味道，彷彿喝了酒，力就會勁起來了。但一想起日來之興頭家（老闆）對他討那一筆數目不小的酒賬正逼討得厲害，心，好像澆着冷水般的冷了半截了。</p>
<p>「怕什麼，橫朢酒賬是得還的，——多賒點有什麽要緊」！李三爹的酒興已是勃發了，嘟噥着，脚不由自主地踅到興記酒莊的門口。</p>
<p>肥胖胖的之興頭家正站在櫃頭上，臉上滿含着笑意，忙來忙去，照應着他的買賣。轉眼瞥見李三爹，頓時笑臉就歛住了，擺着冷面孔說：</p>
<p>「李三爹，你的酒賬無論如何今天是得付還的，不是我不講交情，你知道，中秋節就在眼前了，——我也得付還上頭的酒賬」。理也不理地掉轉頭去承迎其他的主顧。</p>
<p>這使李三爹不好意思跨進去，同時，瞧着之興頭家的冷面孔，肚子裏又有點兒不服氣，「嗯，等一會就給你吧」。負着氣走上溪邊的渡頭去了。</p>
<p>渡頭是冷靜靜的，一隻貨船都沒有，渾紅色的河水，映着熱辣耀眼的陽光，蕩漾了萬道金波，蜿蜓地，平靜地流逝着。</p>
<p>灼熱的驕陽已移到頭項上，把頭心晒得像戴着一盆火熖熊熊的火盆。「再過兩天就是中秋節了，怎麽貨船還沒有來呢」？望着空泛泛的江心，心坎裏不由得焦急起來。於是，他想起從前朋友對他說的那些話來了：「李三爹，你還是找家廊（舖號）去做夥計生活來得妥當吧」。那時候，他聽到朋友的這些話，心窩裏總浮現出幾分驕傲，笑笑地回腔：「我又沒有家累，每月用不着寄家信，這種生活才覺得自由，好過，快樂！……高興時就多賣幾斤氣力，不高興時就盹他媽的一天覺，一點也不受人家的氣和「莽鴿」（限制）。……」那時候是多應的自傲和給人欽羨哩。</p>
<p>李三爹知道生意已沒有希望了，同時，肚子裏又咕咕地響起來，於是，他伸一會懶腰，提起竹槓，拖着沉重的脚步回歸家裏去。</p>
<p>幾個鐘頭在江邊瞭望，使他心身都格外地覺得困倦，一躺下地板上，便呼呼的睡去。</p>
<p>「李三爹，你好睡？——我的頭家要你付酒賬呀」！興記酒莊的小夥計把他吵醒過來。</p>
<p>「媽的皮！離節還有兩天，——老子是不會走掉你的」。</p>
<p>現在，還之興頭家的酒賬倒不放在李三爹的心坎裏，放在心坎裏的却是：「三天沒有酒喝，那才是要命哩」！</p>
<h3 id="c187">初冬的海灣 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>早晨，淡黃色的太陽平舖在斜斜的砂灘上，初冬的、　風却在空中游泳着幾片枯殘的葉子也似渾水里的小鎊鮍般地無處躲藏，終於給打落了下來。祗有石埂上那叢貓兒刺，還豎起了它針鋒的綠葉，頗倔强地蹲在那兒，偶然有陣海風跑過去拉它‘一下，它也不過搖一搖首，一仍舊靜靜地坐着了。</p>
<p>在灘邊，擠着一排不很整齊的網船，約莫有十三四艘，每艘船上全豎起三枝桅檣，檣尖上都掛着一個個的大魚網，成一個三角形的垂在下面，彷彿似一面面的大轟旗，給海風吹得飄呀　的，十分好看。</p>
<p>那些網船的尾艄上全在炊早飯了，那一縷一縷的白烟只從油布篷底下升起來，散在空問里，讓它去和海上的朝霧混合。男人們是在打濕了拖糞把平基和踏舷上的濃霜揩去，一些孩子却跳到海灘上去拾貝壳和石卵了。</p>
<p>大勝伯，正在船頭上太陽底下修補一個破魚網，他一針一針地綴攏着，在那張黧黑而多皺紋的臉上，露着一層不可掩飾的憂鬱和陰暗，兩條淸水鼻涕是像靑蛇似的從他鼻孔里爬出來，伸在他嘴邊。他身上只穿得一襲破棉絮已擠在窟窿外面的舊襖，在太陽底下，兩隻乾枯了的手，還是揑着一枝竹梭在顫抖。可是那個破魚網如他自己一樣的老邁而不中用了，補了東面一個，西邊又看見一個，並且那網綫已脆了，只要那麽不費力的一扯，就會成一個破洞的，然而他還是要靠那個破網生活，這恰像大勝伯一家五口，要靠他生活一樣地不肯放鬆。</p>
<p>「那網眞沒有用了，他將膝上的推到了平基上，另外又拉起一面，翻着說：「早應該打一個新的來用，可是……打一個新的就得十多塊錢，十多塊錢，在這勢口是不容易找的哪！」</p>
<p>的確，他這幾年已給生活壓得不能透一口氣了；生意又壞，吃口又重，吃飯也常常在發生恐慌，那里還會有錢來打網添鈎？就是那條破網船吧，也差了不多有十多年沒有上過岸，揩過油水。</p>
<p>「爹吃飯啦！」他正握住了個破網，在默默地沉思的時候，他那第二個兒子三毛叫他吃早飯了。大勝伯便將那　破網捲了捲緊，丟在驍頭傍邊，自己一低頭就向布篷裏瓚了進去——</p>
<p>「今兒是東南風，如果下半天不轉風頭，明天一定要變的，」大勝伯吃過了早飯，抹着嘴吧，站在船頭上來望望海面；見那濕霧已漸漸地在收斂了，海邊上也已明朗了好多，可是那渾濁的東南風却依舊吹着，吹得那太陽也沒有一點兒光彩。</p>
<p>「大獲快吃，我們早點到東海梢里去把幾堵籪起了起來再說。」他一壁捲着布篷，一壁向他的大兒子說。</p>
<p>「扞還扦得沒有幾天，就要去起起来了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，我想去起起來的好，省得發了大風給浪頭打去！」他老婆也附和着回答。二</p>
<p>海邊上的十幾艘網船全已捲去了布篷，整齊了篷脚索，接連地向着海面上飄出去，剛才沉在水底下的鐵錨，這時全已跳上了每一變船頭。</p>
<p>下午，那海灣里是靜悄悄地，連一條船影子也找不到了；除了海濤的澎湃，和幾隻海鳥在砂灘上跳躍之外，週遭是只剩下一片無涯的死寂！</p>
<p>天空還是扳着副憂鬰的面孔，自從上午直到傍晚，沒有現過一回笑臉，然而，那些網船還沒有回來。</p>
<p>播音</p>
<p>船家曲</p>
<p>長江流水向東流，悠悠悠悠，大船小船東西游，上游下游，來來往往江水長，往往來來年代久，朝陽照照，江波耀耀，夜深明月映沙洲，傻詩人讚美船家樂，誰知道船家愁又愁！</p>
<p>船家生活賴飄流，飄流飄流，向東向西不停留，順流逆流，忙時即即暑不能休，閑時饑餓難煞受，交捐納稅，無錢犯罪，一家生命寄遍舟，有時節遇着風波惡，整個的家庭一旦休！</p>

<p>(Beiping) Because of the tense situation in North China a few days ago, Ho Ying-ch'in specially went north to preside over everything.

The members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee were announced by the National Government yesterday, including Sung Che-yuan, Wan Fu-lin, and 15 others, and Sung was designated as the chairman.

<p>(Beiping) Sung Che-yuan stated that the announcement of the members of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee by the central government was only seen in the newspapers and has not yet received a formal order. Regarding the selection of committee members, he had three opinions: first, do not select traitors; second, select those without stains in society; and third, select those with pure character and a sense of responsibility. Those currently in office do not need to serve as committee members. Regarding the new appointment, if Minister Ho can be stationed in Beiping permanently, he is willing to do his best under Ho's guidance; otherwise, he feels the responsibility is too great. He will take office as Pacification Commissioner after a brief break. Regarding the foreign affairs of North China, he believes that they should be discussed openly and not in secret. Past mistakes were all due to secrecy. Since he handed over the position of Chairman of Chahar on June 20th, he went to Tianjin via Beiping for recuperation. Until September 20th, when he took office as Commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, he only visited Japanese Commander Tada once and did not meet with any other foreign guests. This can be reported to you. Regarding the invasion of the puppet army in the Guyuan area, the security team of Fan Lun-shan is currently firmly guarding it. The Kangbao area is also tight. The other party has long demanded the stationing of the Mongolian security team in six counties, but in fact, it can never be allowed. Negotiations with the other party are currently underway.

<h3 id="e9">Increasing Chips and Arbitrage Trading <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency system, interbank overdrafts by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, credit lending by the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee, and the promotion of commercial acceptance bills in various industries, the number of chips in the city has increased in the past month or so, and there is talk of a sudden revitalization of the market. If this is true, then it is a gratifying phenomenon. As the bank closing period is approaching, lending is still tight, but with the three banks presiding over it, there should be no embarrassment as in last year. Financial management is appropriate, which can alleviate the urgent needs of all industries, help the poor of the industry, revitalize the decline, and carry it forward. Once the closing period is over, the market is expected to develop.</p>
<p>However, at the time of the initial bankruptcy of the countryside, rural funds had already moved and concentrated in Shanghai. At that time, the interbank lending rate was not low, and funds were not crowded. However, speculation in real estate transactions became more and more popular, and arbitrage trading made progress. Therefore, if we follow the current path without changing the old habits, then the increase in chips will still not help the difficulties of industry and commerce. Even if high-interest bonds can be recovered, it is difficult to guarantee that the interest can be reduced. The arbitrage business of speculators in the financial world has become a habit. If the gold standard, foreign exchange market, and stock market are stable, they will turn their attention to securities. When the stock market returns from brilliance to dullness, they will show their skills in yarn, flowers, flour, and wheat. If the financial world does not use its money to circulate the market and develop industry and commerce, but uses it for arbitrage, it may be considered the safest way to make profits. Since high interest is used to absorb deposits, it is necessary to seek corresponding compensation. However, industry and commerce are greatly affected. First, the capital is increased by the oppression of high interest. Second, the funds are accumulated in arbitrage, which makes it inconvenient to circulate. Third, the goods are stored in warehouses, and sales are not active, or it is said that interest rates are reduced. It is said that this problem can be avoided. I don't know that the profit of arbitrage business is superior, and the period is also short. People will compete for it. The way to remedy this is to stipulate that futures trading on the exchange must be delivered with goods upon maturity and must not be resold or bought back. Since this is not allowed in fact, the only way is to promote the financial world's reflection, work hard, and fulfill its responsibility to help industry and commerce. The government authorities should also supervise from the sidelines so that the increase in chips cannot be used to generate profits, but only to distribute profits.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After receiving the telegram from the Presidium of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee (dated the 7th) in France, Hu Hanmin telegraphed the Central Committee from France on the 10th, stating that he would await passage to return home immediately.

<p>Nice: Hu Hanmin, an important figure in the Chinese Kuomintang, has been recuperating at Cape Terrier in the south [of France] for over a month. He is now scheduled to lead his entourage and depart from Marseille within half a month aboard a British or Italian mail steamer to return to China.

<h3 id="e15">Legal Tender Reserve Funds to be Stored in Branch Treasuries in Various Locations; Reportedly the Three Banks Have Complied; Allegation of Cash Concentration in Shanghai is Inaccurate <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Prior to the implementation of the new monetary policy, the reserve funds for currency issuance of various banks were mostly concentrated in Shanghai for redemption purposes. When the decision to implement the new monetary policy was made, the Ministry of Finance established a Committee for the Management of Legal Tender Reserve Funds in Shanghai to manage these funds. With the promotion of legal tender encompassing a wider range, especially inland areas, plans were made to establish branch committees for the management of issuance reserves in various locations to manage reserves, thereby facilitating market conditions and ensuring fairness. The establishment of branch committees and treasuries for the management of issuance reserves in Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Xi'an, Chongqing, and other places was carried out in accordance with this plan. It has recently been learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to make the public aware of the status of the legal tender reserves, specifically instructed the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to allocate the legal tender reserves stored in Shanghai to branch treasuries in various locations according to the amount of legal tender issued inland, in order to strengthen currency credibility. It is reported that the three banks have complied and are implementing this measure. This clearly indicates that recent rumors of cash concentration in Shanghai are either false or have ulterior motives, and are not credible. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news reports claim that the U.S. Treasury's move to stop purchasing silver is a result of China's currency reform and that the difficulties encountered in the London silver market were caused by China's large-scale silver sales in London. According to sources familiar with the matter, this claim is not credible. As to whether the U.S. Treasury's move to stop purchasing silver is a precursor to a change in its silver purchase policy, sources familiar with the matter declined to comment, only stating that China is closely monitoring its progress.

<p>(Beiping) The Shanghai News reported on the 7th, citing Reuters, that regarding the issue of Japanese aircraft flying over the sky of Beiping, someone asked if Japanese aircraft had the right to fly over Chinese territory based on the 保種条約. A Japanese military spokesman replied that during the negotiations between He Yingqin and Umezu on the 6th, He had agreed that Japanese aircraft could fly over any location in Hebei Province. According to a certain former official of the Beiping Military Sub-Council, it is absolutely false that Minister He had allowed Japanese aircraft to fly over any location in Hebei Province. From the beginning to the end of the Sino-Japanese negotiations on the Hebei Province incident in January of this year, this matter was never mentioned. Furthermore, the news reported in the Japanese newspapers, such as the so-called "He-Umezu Agreement," is a term that deviates from the facts, as there is no such agreement at all. The official also stated that after the settlement of the Hebei incident, Japanese General Umezu and Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi formally issued a statement on January 28th. Umezu's statement said that the main point of our military's request in this negotiation is to mutually value good faith and strive for peace. If we only seek to expand the situation or rashly interfere in internal affairs, it will never be considered. This shows that the negotiations at that time did not involve China's internal affairs at all. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) The House of Commons today paid considerable attention to British shipping in China. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Malone asked Foreign Secretary Hoare if he had received a report from British Ambassador to China Cadogan regarding China's discriminatory treatment of British ships at the newly opened commercial port of Lao Yao. He also asked if Cadogan, in view of the importance of this seaport and for the sake of Sino-British friendship, had negotiated with the Chinese government to abolish various unequal restrictions imposed on British ships. Prime Minister Baldwin replied that British ships were permitted to trade at Lao Yao under the inland waterway regulations. He had heard that some difficulties had arisen in the implementation of these regulations. The Foreign Office would soon receive a report on this matter, and the British government would give it careful attention. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(New York) The Scripps-Howard newspaper commented today on Howard's report on the future of Philippine independence, saying: "A foster daughter who marries off and returns disappointed seeks refuge. Can you close your door to her? The relationship between the United States and the Philippines, although not entirely severed, will inevitably come to this one day." The Philippines, at the cost of losing the U.S. market as the price of its freedom, will eventually fall into commercial collapse and hardship, and internal instability will inevitably lead to foreign aggression. The United States initially hoped to guarantee the independence of the Philippines by treaty, but the political and territorial integrity of China has long been guaranteed by strong powers. What is to be done now? Although the Philippines may not face serious threats, if the United States wants to make a choice between welcoming and rejecting, the nation, like an individual, cannot ignore its moral responsibilities. Therefore, the United States must devise new plans to protect the Philippines from new troubles in the Western Pacific. (National News dispatch, 11th)</p>

(Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and British Minister Without Portfolio Eden arrived here this morning, they were advised that the Anglo-French proposals for resolving the Italian-Ethiopian dispute should be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for discussion, rather than to the Five-Nation Committee. The Council should convene a meeting immediately, as the current situation is important and requires the Council's attention. It is generally believed that all member states, regardless of size, should have the opportunity to express their positions on this matter. Laval did not object to this suggestion and stated that the League of Nations should adopt whatever procedure it deemed appropriate. However, Laval and British Minister Without Portfolio Eden and Spanish representative and Chairman of the Five-Nation Committee Madariaga had already discussed this issue in the car on their way to Geneva and had agreed to convene the Five-Nation Committee. In addition, this correspondent has learned that although there was an important debate at the Committee of Eighteen Nations meeting in the afternoon, the lounge of the League of Nations was still empty this morning, as the main diplomatic activities were taking place in the offices of various national delegations.

<p>(Rome) At 5:00 PM today, French Ambassador Chambrun visited Prime Minister Mussolini and presented him with the French text of the Anglo-French plan for resolving the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. Half an hour later, British Ambassador Drummond followed suit and presented the Prime Minister with the English text of the same plan. The three men carefully compared the Anglo-French texts and then held talks. Afterwards, the Italian government issued a communique stating that "the Prime Minister declared to the British and French ambassadors that the cooperation demonstrated by the two governments in the talks in Paris was gratifying and that he would consider the proposals made by the two ambassadors." According to responsible sources, the Anglo-French proposals are technical in nature and will be studied seriously. It will take several days to accomplish this, so the Prime Minister cannot provide an immediate response. Responsible sources also praised the efforts of the United Kingdom and France to mediate the dispute. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Ethiopian Ambassador to France Mayang visited French Prime Minister Laval today. Laval explained the Anglo-French peace plan and urged Ethiopia to prioritize peace and maintain a moderate attitude. After returning to his office, the Ethiopian ambassador issued a communique stating that "Ethiopia will firmly reject anything, directly or indirectly, that contains the following, because Italy's unjust aggression against Ethiopia has been solemnly condemned by the Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations: (1) granting any benefits to the aggressor Italy; (2) disregarding the fundamental principles established by the League of Nations, especially the principles of Ethiopia's territorial and political integrity; (3) exerting pressure on a weak country to subject it to the control of a strong government, and this strong government has not ceased to believe that it can safeguard the victory of its ambitions by force, with or without the assistance of the League of Nations."

<p>(London) The House of Commons expressed concern about the Anglo-French peace plan today and repeatedly questioned Prime Minister Baldwin. Labour Party Dalton asked the Prime Minister to explain this peace plan. Baldwin replied that he had already spoken about it in yesterday's debate. Today, those who are most eager to have the details of the plan published are himself, but this power is not in the hands of the British government, so he cannot release the proposal at this time. Baldwin also stated that we cannot predict whether the Council of the League of Nations' Five-Nation Committee or the Committee of Eighteen Nations will handle this matter before Eden arrives in Geneva. Liberal Party Harris asked the Prime Minister to guarantee that the British government would not approve any solution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute that violated Ethiopia's territorial integrity or commercial independence without the consent of the Ethiopian government. The Prime Minister replied that Foreign Secretary Hoare had announced the British government's policy on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute on December 5th, stating that any plan resulting from discussions must be acceptable to Italy, Ethiopia, and the League of Nations. Eden also reiterated this policy repeatedly in yesterday's debate. Someone asked if France would provide assistance to British fleets if Italy attacked British fleets. The Prime Minister replied that it would not be in the public interest to release the British and French government documents on this matter at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Cairo - The cabinet was about to consider resignation today. After being summoned by the Egyptian King, the Prime Minister was ordered to restore the 1923 Constitution, which stipulates a parliamentary system. (National Telegram, December 12)</p>
<p>Cairo - After the Nationalist Party and the Liberal Party formed a unified party, the cabinet resolved today to restore the parliamentary constitution of 1923. Prime Minister Nessim entered the palace this afternoon to meet with the Egyptian King, who granted an edict announcing the restoration of the constitution. This constitution was repealed in 1930. It stipulates a Senate composed of one hundred members, with sixty appointed by the King and forty elected by the people. The House of Representatives has one hundred and fifty members, all elected by the people. The current government will remain in office temporarily, but not until after the general election. The unified party has resolved to accept the treaty drafted in London in 1930, which was previously rejected. The treaty stipulates the independence of Egypt, allowing it to join the League of Nations. Britain is responsible for the defense of Egypt and other matters. The current international situation is particularly tense. The British fleet is docked in Alexandria, and a large number of Italian troops are stationed in Libya. Therefore, the military provisions of the treaty are very important, mainly because the treaty stipulates that British troops stationed in Cairo should be stationed in the Suez Canal area. Due to recent political developments, Britain's position in Egypt is no longer as weak as before. (Reuters Telegram, December 12)</p>

<p>(London) Britain and the United States, leading the representatives of seven countries at the Naval Conference, rejected Japan's demand for equality today. The meeting then adjourned until tomorrow. During today's meeting, U.S. Representative Davis presented three reasons for opposing Japan's demands: (1) It would incite naval competition; (2) It would overturn the balance established by the Washington and London treaties; (3) Japan did not take into account the naval needs of other countries. (National Telegram, December 12)</p>
<p>(London) At today's naval conference, the representatives of various countries studied Japan's demand for naval equality, with much criticism. The Japanese chief representative, Nagano, is currently communicating with Tokyo in order to explain Japan's position in detail at tomorrow's meeting. One of the main issues today was how Japan can reconcile its demand for equality with its principle of security equality, which was outlined by the Japanese representative and accepted by other delegations. U.S. Chief Representative Davis strongly opposed Japan's common upper limit proposal, arguing that it would increase rather than decrease the construction of warships and would disregard the true needs of the navy. British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell also opposed it. Representatives from South Africa, Australia, and Canada supported Monsell's proposal. All discussions have been very amicable so far, and no setbacks have occurred. (Reuters Telegram, December 12)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Japanese Demand for Equality Acknowledged in Principle, Actual Equality Postponed to a Later Date <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(London) At this morning's naval conference, the fundamental policy of Japan's common high limit, in other words, naval equality, will once again be the main topic of discussion, as the representatives still require supplementary and detailed explanations of the interpretation made by Japanese Chief Representative General Nagano yesterday. Nagano insisted on Japan's attitude of being able to advocate for a common high limit without any change, which greatly disappointed the conference. The Japanese chief representative declared yesterday that Japan is willing to be equal to the United States and Britain on the lowest possible basis. To achieve this basis, Japan is willing to dismantle its battleships, aircraft carriers, and 10,000-ton cruisers, provided that other major naval powers do the same. Japan is particularly demanding that its navy be equal to the United States and Britain because it is vulnerable to attack. Only this can ensure Japan's safety. Yesterday's meeting lasted two hours and was the subject of intense discussion. The meeting was even adjourned to allow the representatives to discuss Nagano's remarks. The representatives proposed issuing a declaration acknowledging Japan's naval equality in principle, but postponing actual equality to a later date. However, it is not known whether Japan will be satisfied with this. This major issue is now causing anxiety for the other representatives, who are seeking a compromise on Japan's demands, such as whether Japan would accept a two-year shipbuilding program instead of the five-year program proposed by Britain. (Reuters Telegram, December 12)</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Chief Representative General Nagano declared to the Naval Conference today that Japan is willing to reduce its naval tonnage to any level, as long as it is equal to the total tonnage of the United States and Britain. With this statement, Nagano rejected the proposal of the United States and Britain to discuss the number and size of warships of various classes separately. The Japanese representative further stated that if the equal limit is below the existing tonnage, the United States and Britain should dismantle some of their warships. If it is lower than Japan's existing tonnage, Japan is also prepared to dismantle part of its fleet. Japan is unwilling to wait fifteen years to build up to an equal level, as such a restriction would extend the term of the ratio system. Japan is unwilling to publish its construction plans until the conference has decided on the total tonnage of each country and the restrictions on the number and size of warships of various classes. It is understood that Nagano is willing to replace his demand for equality with a ratio of 5:4:4 for Britain, the United States, and Japan, and stated that Japan must wait until the total tonnage has been agreed upon before discussing the restrictions on the number and size of warships of various classes. (National Telegram, December 11)</p>
<p>(London) The First Committee of the Naval Conference held its second meeting at Clarence House today. When the Japanese representative explained the country's proposal in detail, the differences between it and the proposals made by the United States and Britain became increasingly apparent. At that time, although the Japanese representative explained the country's naval needs in detail, it still failed to fully answer the questions raised by the delegations of other countries last night. The Japanese representative first explained the special needs of the country's navy, and presented figures as a basis. Then, from a technical point of view, it detailed the "common upper limit" method and the necessity of abolishing large ships or reducing tonnage. Regarding the balance originally stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty, the Japanese representative had previously stated that the country's responsibilities in Asia had increased, and now reiterated this statement, saying that the Washington Naval Treaty was established in 1922 based on the situation at that time, and was not a fair way to meet the needs of each naval power, and therefore cannot be considered complete. This observation is still the same today. Regarding the "common upper limit" issue, the Japanese representative stated that the country's existing naval tonnage should be used as the "standard," and the armaments of the major naval powers should be reduced to the same amount. Although some factors should be taken into account geographically, it is not in favor of allowing warships of various countries to differ from each other in quantity or in purely qualitative aspects for strategic reasons. The Japanese representative also believes that all naval powers may as well join the common upper limit agreement, but this is not important. As for whether the tonnage of each country's navy should be reduced to the Japanese naval level within a certain period of time, and how long it should be, it is said that it is currently impossible to provide accurate figures, and no answer has yet been given. Overall, the situation at today's meeting can be described as unremarkable, except that the Japanese representative's speech occasionally encountered difficulties when translated into English and French. It is obvious that the strength of the United States and Britain to resist Japan has become weaker. In addition, the "common upper limit" proposed by Japan also contains a most important issue, namely, whether Japan takes the recognition of naval equality as a prerequisite for the establishment of a naval agreement. The Japanese representative did not explain this point. In short, the future of the Naval Conference depends on how the United States and Britain respond to Japan's demands.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government submitted its policy of common maximum disarmament to the First Committee on Disarmament for discussion on the 11th. Whether this meeting will be successful or not can be determined in the next two or three days. In view of the serious atmosphere of the disarmament conference, the Japan United Press directly exchanged views with Nagano Plenipotentiary in London via international telephone, inquiring about the Plenipotentiary's views on the conference. The situation of the conversation between the Japan United Press reporter and Nagano Plenipotentiary is briefly recorded below.</p>
<p>Reporter: What is the atmosphere of the meeting and the impression you feel?</p>
<p>Plenipotentiary: The meeting is very calm on the surface and follows the agenda.</p>
<p>Question: When the United States and Japan are in opposition on the issue of common maximum and the meeting is on the verge of a standstill, will the United Kingdom temporarily reserve the discussion of quantitative restrictions and propose the discussion of qualitative restrictions to get through this difficult situation?</p>
<p>Answer: The meeting is in progress, and it is not convenient to express an opinion. However, if the meeting encounters any situation or situation, we are prepared and will not be afraid of it.</p>
<p>Question: Is there an understanding among the countries on the proposal to separate the regulations limiting the use of submarines from the London Treaty and make it an independent agreement?</p>
<p>Answer: In short, this is a question of the use of submarines. Whether France and Italy will participate in this case has not yet been decided. (Dentsu Telegram, December 12)</p>
<h3 id="e32">U.S. Treasury Department Declares Continuation of Silver Policy; This Strategy Demonstrates Global Currency Power; Indirectly Indicates U.S. Influence in the Far East Cannot Be Underestimated; London Silver Market Remains Chaotic; U.S. Only Purchased a Small Amount Yesterday <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Congressional silver advocates today praised the Treasury Department's actions that brought the London silver market to a standstill, as this move showed that the United States controlled the world's basic monetary resources and indirectly indicated the importance of American political power to the Far East. According to sources close to the Pittman Investigating Committee, the Treasury Department's strategy has shown that the United States is capable of eliminating the profits of those who smuggle silver out of China, and said that the United States has 1,000 million yuan in cash and 150 million yuan in silver. Any action will affect countries with gold or silver standards or managed currencies. Senator Thomas's views were similar, believing that although Britain had attracted many countries to form the Gold Pound Group, the United States could still control the world's monetary system. Britain's Gold Pound Group is an organization to counter the United States, but the United States has sufficient resources to absorb gold and silver from all over the world and advocate for stability. Some in diplomatic circles speculate that the United States' demonstration of its power at the opening of the London Naval Conference may be an indirect warning, indicating that although the United States has insufficient troops in the Far East, it also has a strong influence. However, as the price of silver falls, the value of the United States' silver reserves also decreases, with losses reaching 28 million yuan. The most appropriate explanation for the recent drop in silver prices is still as follows: On Tuesday, the London market had 25 million ounces of silver for sale. If the United States purchased all of it, it would first have to purchase 3 million pounds of British gold, fearing that the pound price would rise sharply and affect foreign exchange, so it temporarily stopped purchasing. Today, the Treasury Department still firmly insists that the silver purchase policy has not changed, which is also noteworthy. If it wants to achieve a ratio of three parts gold to one part silver, the United States still needs to purchase 130 million ounces. (National Telegram, December 11)</p>
<p>(London) Londoners believe that the U.S. government suspended the purchase of silver because the Chinese government's decision not to use silver as currency undermined the U.S.'s goal of increasing the purchasing power of the silver group. This is considered a retaliatory action. Senator Thomas, a leader of the silver faction in the U.S. Senate, strongly supports the Treasury Department's remarks on changing the silver purchase policy, which is considered important because the change in this policy will cause the silver price, which the silver faction previously fully supported, to fall. Thomas actually considers the change a good strategy, which is why his remarks are highly valued. The U.S. Treasury Department's actions caused the London silver market to remain chaotic today, unable to settle silver prices normally and promptly. Approximately 6 million ounces of silver were sold, but the U.S. Treasury Department only prepared to purchase 450,000 ounces. As a result, the exchange allocated the amount purchased by the United States to the various sellers. There were fewer sellers of forward silver, knowing that there may not be an opportunity to settle the price of forward silver for a while. However, it is reported that some forward entrustment orders have been changed to spot sales. In the morning, because there was no news of U.S. purchases, the market was chaotic again, but the spot price was finally determined to be 27.5 pence, but only a portion of the sales were transacted. There was no trading in forward silver. Sellers were limited to the amount that the United States was willing to buy. It is estimated that the amount purchased by the United States was only about 7.5% of the sales. After the silver price was listed, there were only sellers and no buyers. (Reuters Telegram, December 11)</p>
<p>(London) The London silver price only stopped falling after the U.S. Treasury Department purchased 500,000 ounces today. However, the amount purchased by the United States was only 7.5% of the total offered before the listing, and was purchased on an average basis based on the amount offered by each party. At the same time, brokers have decided to temporarily suspend trading to wait for the market atmosphere to clear up a bit. Someone intended to organize a banking group to rescue the silver market, but it failed today. The details of the plan could not be confirmed, but according to rumors, banks in the Far East contacted American banks to organize this group. It is also reported that brokers have advised some customers to amend their "sell at market price" entrustments to slightly reduce the current pressure. (National Telegram, December 11)</p>
<p>(London) The U.S. silver policy is extremely confusing. London and New York are both in the dark. According to the Financial Times, Wall Street bankers have no idea about the British Treasury Department's intentions. The U.S. Treasury Department's monetary policy was initially to purchase gold, and then to purchase silver. The results have not disappointed the U.S. Treasury Department, which is probably the real reason for the sudden suspension of the silver purchase policy. The success of the U.S. silver policy is nothing more than disrupting Chinese trade, forcing China to abandon the silver standard, and creating the status of speculators and long positions. If the United States does not purchase, then this long position will not be able to end. The Daily Telegraph reported that although the United States purchased very little silver yesterday, the United States has re-entered the silver market, which is gratifying. The general opinion is that the United States now wants to crack down on speculators. The Financial News stated that the United States wants to force China to restore the silver standard. The United States has the power to force the Chinese government to do so. If the United States does not purchase silver from the Chinese government, it can destroy the Chinese government's recently adopted monetary reform plan, as the Chinese government will not be able to maintain the exchange rate of the currency at the new price. How much will the price of silver have to fall to reach equilibrium? This is the question. (Reuters Telegram, December 12)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Treasury Department's change in silver strategy has once again led to speculation that the government's silver purchase policy will become an important issue in the Senate after Congress convenes. Senator Thomas stated today that when Congress reconvenes, he will convene silver faction members to examine the entire situation, or ask whether to ask the U.S. Treasury Secretary to explain his actions. Thomas replied, "I do not pay attention to this procedure, because Morgenthau does not need to attend the Senate, nor can he be forced to attend. Even if Morgenthau attends, he does not need to answer any questions." The U.S. Treasury Department is still silent, and New Yorkers are speculating more and more about the silver stalemate. Wall Street operators expressed their opinions, saying that the Treasury Department will still buy silver, but in smaller quantities and at lower prices. At the same time, some people speculate about the possibility of China reconsidering its monetary system plan and still accumulating silver coins. Judging from the current situation, the silver faction in the Senate may continue to fight and force the Treasury Department to express its strategy and opinions, but it is generally believed that the silver faction's actions may not be successful. (Reuters Telegram, December 11)</p>
<p>(Washington) Representative Dice, an active member of the silver faction in the House of Representatives, declared today that he would ask President Roosevelt to implement the silver purchase law to revitalize American exports. The law has a broad meaning and allows the United States to exchange surplus goods for foreign silver, so as to avoid purchasing in the open market and causing the current international unrest. We should clearly tell the world that we only want to purchase the same amount of silver from countries that purchase surplus American goods. If so, we can sell surplus cotton and wheat according to the barter method and prevent speculation and the difficulties encountered in previous silver purchases. According to the current plan, silver merchants use the proceeds from the sale of silver to purchase American securities or engage in speculation, neither of which is beneficial to American export trade. I believe the government will terminate the purchase of silver, but will change the implementation of the plan. If we can accept silver for offsetting accounts, we can avoid the problems caused by the large inflow of gold into the United States. This problem may continue to occur, but it can be avoided by accepting silver. (National Telegram, December 11)</p>
<p>(New York) Forbes, the head of the American Far East Economic Investigation Group, discussed the current silver turmoil with reporters from the Associated Press, saying that his views had been explained in the report submitted by the group after returning to the country earlier this year. The report inferred that there would be a possibility of something similar to the current chaos in the world silver market. Forbes also said that he has not changed his views on American silver policy since submitting the report. As for what Howard, the president of United Press International, said yesterday that Filipinos hope to permanently maintain the current autonomous system, Forbes said that Filipinos have achieved their wishes and will make their own decisions on future actions. Forbes was the Governor of the Philippines. (National Telegram, December 11)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese foreign exchange banks believe that the chaos in the London silver market depends on the trend of American silver policy. Their observations are as follows: (1) If the United States temporarily suspends silver purchases in the London market, then the U.S.-British exchange rate will naturally fall, which is weak material for the U.S.-Japanese exchange rate. (2) However, if the United States actively continues to maintain the price of silver, then because the anxiety over silver has intensified, the momentum for selling will inevitably continue. In order to absorb it, the United States needs huge amounts of silver purchase funds, and the U.S.-British exchange rate is expected to rebound. The Japanese exchange rate against the United States and Britain is also firm. However, the sharp drop in silver prices overseas will reduce the silver prices held by foreign banks in China, so the attitude of foreign banks is highly noteworthy. (DenTsushin Telegram, December 12)</p>
<p>(London) Today's silver price was sharply adjusted. The spot price fell from 28.75 pence to 27.5 pence. There was no market for forward silver. A total of 4 million ounces of silver were sold on the market, of which only about 500,000 ounces were purchased by the United States. It is possible that the remaining amount will still be purchased by the United States in the evening. (Havas Telegram, December 11)</p>

<h3 id="e34">If China and Japan Go to War, Who Will Win? Observations by a Foreign Military Expert <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources from Japan, a certain foreign military expert made the following conclusions regarding the question of who would win or lose if China and Japan formally went to war: "The expansion of Japan's military strength is an undeniable fact. In the Pacific Ocean, only the combined forces of the United States and Britain are sufficient to restrain its naval power. However, since China has no navy, the Japanese navy can only pose a limited threat to the coastal provinces of China. As for the Japanese army, although it has 6 million regular troops, the military spending it has spent since preparing to invade China for more than 40 years is inestimable. Although its domestic industry is developed, it is very difficult to obtain raw materials. Even Manchuria, due to local unrest, can only transfer a small part of its troops to attack the Chinese mainland. Moreover, in recent years, in order to dump goods abroad, resources have flowed out, and the country's lifeline has lost a lot. As for Japan's hegemonic behavior, it has long been disfavored by the powers and has reached a state of financial exhaustion. Moreover, China's decisive implementation of the new monetary policy has resulted in sluggish sales of Japanese goods, with losses of no less than tens of millions of yuan. Compared with Japan, China's vast territory, abundant resources, large population, and unexploited resources are far superior in strength. If the country can unite, it will be difficult for Japan to win the invasion of China. It is a pity that there are some shallow and ignorant people who believe that China will definitely lose the Sino-Japanese War, and they deposit cash in Japanese banks. They will regret it in the future. Are you foolish Chinese people? Why don't you wake up?" (China United Press Telegram, December 12)</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York Cotton: The New York cotton market opened today with a slight increase in opening prices due to better market conditions. However, trading was very quiet, and price fluctuations were minimal. Although Secretary of Agriculture Wallace's annual report stated that cotton production controls would continue for many years, the silver situation and the Supreme Court's upcoming ruling on cotton processing taxes are factors that ultimately prevent people from operating boldly.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: Prices fell today due to unfavorable overnight telegrams from the US cotton market. At 1 PM, the price for January futures was 6.25, down ten pounds.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: The opening price today fell slightly. Although telegrams from Liverpool were unfavorable, prices here later rose slightly, exceeding yesterday's closing price. The feed grain market was stable, and prices remained unchanged, due to limited deliveries and poor quality.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: The opening price today fell slightly. Subsequently, disappointing foreign telegrams led to quiet trading, and prices continued to fall. There were reports of the settlement of December futures for South Australian wheat. At the same time, the weekly export figures for Russian wheat were also a factor favoring short positions. At 1 PM, December futures fell by one penny to 5 shillings and 10.5 pence. The corn market was weak, and prices remained unchanged.</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Guyuan, the puppet troops of Li Shouxin's unit, some days ago, more than [number] men, led by Captain Li Kechang, left the city to meet the attack, and were killed in action. The rest retreated, and Baochang was occupied. After occupying Baochang, the puppet troops advanced further and besieged Guyuan. The security forces in the city held firm while awaiting reinforcements. Yesterday, reinforcements arrived from Dushikou, and the siege of Guyuan was lifted. The area is now secure. There are also reports that Baochang has been recaptured, but this has not been confirmed. The puppet troops have also received reinforcements and may launch another attack.

<p>(Beiping) According to Song Zheyuan, after the outbreak of hostilities in the Guyuan area, it has been three days and nights. They are currently in a stalemate. The county town of Baochang was captured because it was only garrisoned by a security force of about one hundred men. The Baochang security force retreated towards Ertai. The puppet troops have a tendency to advance towards Kangbao. The city of Guyuan has been fortified and has a larger number of security forces, so it can hold firm. However, the rear guard troops in Guyuan have also increased. Regarding the Japanese side's representation on this matter, it is a request to station Mongolian security forces in the six counties of Zhangbei, Guyuan, Baochang, Shangdu, Kangbao, and Huade, to manage the twelve banners and four and a half sheep herds in those six counties. However, this is not Inner Mongolian territory. The previous government had agreed to allow Mongolians to graze sheep in the area north of Xilingol League. Therefore, there are horse herds and sheep herds in that area. The Japanese side's opinion is actually a misunderstanding. (December 12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e38">Beijing Journalists Association Telegraphed Request to Implement Freedom of the Press, Restore Convenience of Reporting <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Journalists Association held its fifth joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 PM on December 12th. They passed a motion to request the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government to implement freedom of legitimate public opinion, to protect the freedom of journalists, and to restore the convenience of reporting. The original petition is recorded below: "Petition to request the prompt implementation of freedom of legitimate public opinion. We believe that at the Third Plenary Session of the First Central Committee, Central Committee members Zhou Fohai and 55 others proposed to the National Government to issue an order to the whole country to effectively protect legitimate public opinion. The General Assembly passed the original proposal, and the National Government instructed all directly subordinate agencies to forward it to their subordinates for compliance. We see the Central Government's emphasis on public opinion and its great concern for journalists. We are deeply grateful and wish to take this opportunity to offer our views, hoping for your consideration. Since the opening of the Sixth Plenary Session on November 1st, when President Wang was attacked in front of the Central Conference Hall, because the murderer had an organized group and falsely claimed an admission certificate to enter the Central Party Headquarters, a subsequent investigation placed all journalists in a position of suspicion. From party and government agencies to police and soldiers, whenever encountering journalists reporting, they would either respond with harsh words, refuse them outright, or openly mock and humiliate them. Some spoke to vent their feelings, while others felt unbearable insult. Journalism is a legitimate profession, and journalists are also propagandists. The situation is painful. Furthermore, stations, ports, and airports, where journalists used to be able to report freely, have now become fraught with difficulties. Even greeting relatives and friends is often blocked by police officers at the station. We have heard and seen many things in the past month and feel deeply. The above situation is completely contrary to the Central Government's intention to protect legitimate public opinion. Now that the truth of the murder case is gradually becoming clear, and the Central Government is emphasizing public opinion, it does not seem appropriate to treat the good and bad alike, leaving journalists in a state of constant suspicion and subject to unnecessary impolite treatment. We are hereby submitting this petition, asking that you take steps to remedy the situation, both to protect the freedom of journalists and to restore the convenience of reporting. We respectfully request that you instruct all agencies directly under the Central Government to be informed, so that the case of protecting legitimate public opinion can be effectively implemented. This would be a great blessing. Respectfully submitted to the Central Propaganda Department, National Government, by the Nanjing Journalists Association."

<p>Hankou Dispatch: Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, has been transferred to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. On the 10th, Zhang returned to Hubei from Nanjing. On the 11th, he convened a meeting of department heads at the provincial government, expressing his hope that they would continue to diligently carry out their official duties, especially emphasizing joint office work. According to what Zhang said regarding future diplomatic policy, he stated, "I was born and raised in Hubei Province, and Hubei is my hometown. This departure is deeply regrettable. Recalling my service to Hubei Province, now two years, disasters have occurred repeatedly, and the people have not yet recovered. It is due to my lack of virtue that I have been unable to inspire harmony. Fortunately, I have received the generous assistance of the people of the province, which has allowed me to strive to overcome all difficulties. Some of the things I have done have been completed, and some are still awaiting implementation. It is my original intention to always be respectful and dedicated to my homeland, to live in Hubei, die in Hubei, and be buried in Hubei. I will never be fickle. The Central Government has repeatedly ordered me to take charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but I have always declined. This time, with the reorganization of the central leadership, I was ordered to be transferred internally. I am a military man by origin and later engaged in internal affairs. Diplomacy is by no means something I am familiar with, and I dare not take on this important task. However, since I am a party member and not in a private position, I have no choice but to obey the Central Government's orders and reluctantly accept this difficult task. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang has come forward to take responsibility. I will take Chairman Chiang's conclusion on foreign relations, declared at the Fifth Plenary Session last month on the 19th—'Never give up peace as long as there is no complete despair of peace, and never lightly speak of sacrifice as long as the point of ultimate sacrifice has not been reached'—as the guiding principle for handling diplomatic affairs. The current national policy of China is 'seek self-preservation internally, seek coexistence externally,' and diplomatic policy is no exception. China and Japan are connected by race, history, and geography. Both are major powers in East Asia and share the responsibility of maintaining peace in East Asia. Therefore, the general relationship between China and Japan should seek overall adjustment. Even the North China issue should be resolved under unified diplomacy. These are all understandings that both China and Japan should have and should jointly define as national policy." Ambassador to Japan Chiang Tso-pin has been transferred to head internal affairs, and his successor has not yet been determined. Rumors that Chen Yi will be sent to Japan are completely unfounded. As for the news that Japanese Ambassador to China Ariyoshi Akira has been ordered to return home and that the Minister to Belgium, Arita Hachiro, will be sent to China, I have heard something about it, but my consent has not yet been sought. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo and Permanent Vice Minister Tang Youren are both well-versed in diplomacy and are willing to assist me. However, Vice Minister Tang has expressed his intention to retire, which will be discussed after arriving in Nanjing. Mr. Hu Hanmin has been scheduled to return to China next month. Director He Xuechu (Cheng Jun) was delayed in returning to Hubei due to a cold, and there is no talk of other transfers. Minister He Yingqin will not stay in Beiping for long and will soon return to Nanjing," and so on. Zhang has now scheduled a reception for Chinese and foreign friends at the Yanye Bank on the 12th as a farewell. Approximately two hundred people have been invited. Department heads and committee members of the provincial government, as well as various legal entities, have also scheduled farewell dinners for him on the same day. Zhang will still take a flight to Nanjing on the 13th and will assume office on the 14th. (11th)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Wang Zhengting Returns to Shanghai from Japan Yesterday, Denies Negotiating American Loans <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Wang Zhengting, accompanied by Fan Guang, Superintendent of the Hangzhou Customs, went to Japan some time ago to discuss matters related to the Liuhegou Coal Mine Company and, in his personal capacity, visited Japanese authorities in Tokyo. The public affairs have been completed and he arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru from Japan at 4 PM yesterday. Friends of Wang in Shanghai, such as Zhao Jinqing, Liu Yunfang, Xia Qifeng, and Zhao TieZhang, welcomed him at the Huishan Wharf. After disembarking, Wang returned to his private residence on Gu Bai Road to rest. According to Wang, when he arrived in Shanghai on the ship, he told the Central News Agency reporter that he had gone to Japan to handle personal affairs and, in his personal capacity, met with Japanese authorities. The process was good. The Japanese government and public have a good attitude towards Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. After returning to Shanghai, I will rest for a while and then schedule a trip to Nanjing. The date of going to Europe and the United States has not yet been determined. However, I have decided to go to Europe when the World Games open. Wang laughed off rumors that he had negotiated loan issues with US Vice President Garner on the ship on the way to Japan and said that such rumors were not worth denying.</p>

<p>Former Acting Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Peiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, Wang Kemin, has been residing in Shanghai since his dismissal. Yesterday, because the Central Government appointed him as a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, he telegraphed Chiang to resign. The original text is as follows: To President Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: According to news reports, I have been appointed as a member of the Hebei-Chahar Government Committee by order of the National Government. Since my resignation in the autumn, I have been recuperating and have not been involved in foreign affairs for a long time. I returned south last month to arrange for burial, which has not yet been completed. The political affairs of Hebei and Chahar are complex and difficult, which is not something that I, Wang Kemin, who am lazy and clumsy, can handle. I intend to request permission to resign immediately. I am extremely grateful and await orders, Wang Kemin, bowing.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British special commissioner sent to China to investigate the economic situation, went north from Shanghai on the 22nd of last month and went to Peiping and Tianjin to conduct a survey of the valley in North China.

<h3 id="e75">Ministry of Finance Orders Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to Prevent Rice Merchants from Smuggling Silver Coins <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday instructed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, saying that it has been widely publicized that cash should not be used since the implementation of legal tender. Recently, there have been unscrupulous merchants raising prices to buy silver coins, hoping to smuggle them out of the country for profit. (These unscrupulous merchants only care about private interests and disregard the overall situation, and it is hateful that they are willing to break the law. The Ministry has also notified all political, military, police agencies and customs to strictly arrest and punish them according to the law.) It is found that the rice industry often uses the exchange of silver dimes and copper coins as an incidental business. It is inevitable to exchange silver coins, but it should follow the method of exchanging legal tender, and send them to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Three Banks for exchange of legal tender for use at any time. Private storage is not allowed. However, there are many colleagues in the industry. It is inevitable that some will be confused by private interests and privately store the exchanged silver coins, hoping to sell them, which is an illegal act. The Association should immediately instruct the Rice Industry Association to convene a meeting of all colleagues to discuss and formulate measures to crack down on private hoarding and the sale of silver coins, so as to comply with and emphasize currency policy. The agreed-upon measures should still be submitted to the Ministry for verification. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e76">China Morning Industry Loan Syndicate Achieves Considerable Results This Year; A Total of More Than 1.7 Million Yuan Loaned Out; It is Decided to Increase the Amount and Expand the Loan Area Next Year <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate is organized by ten banks, including the Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Jincheng Bank, China Farmers Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Dalu Bank, Guohua Bank, Xinhua Bank, and the Four-Bank Savings Society. It was established in February of this year. The standing directors are Zou Bingwen of Shanghai, Li Zhongchu of the Bank of Communications, and Wu Kenyuan of Jincheng Bank. The general office is located in the Shanghai Bank of Communications, and the branch offices are in the Jincheng Bank of Beiping in North China, the Bank of Communications of Zhengzhou in Henan, the Shanghai Bank of Xi'an in Shaanxi, and the China Farmers Bank of Hankou in Hubei. The original loan plan for the 24th year of the Republic was 3 million yuan in national currency, including 1.2 million yuan in Shaanxi Province, 900,000 yuan in Henan Province, 500,000 yuan in Hebei Province, and 400,000 yuan in Hubei Province.</p>
<p>This Year's Results</p>
<p>The loans are aimed at cooperatives, with an interest rate of 9% per week. Farmers are guided to organize cooperatives, and the syndicate lends to cooperatives, which in turn lend to farmers. This year's plan is to focus on cotton production and marketing cooperatives in the three regions of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hebei, and lend three types of loans for production, utilization, and marketing. The Shaanxi region is organized by the Shanghai Bank, and 17 production and marketing cooperatives have been established, distributed in Chang'an, Weinan, Lintong, and other counties, making production loans of more than 500,000 yuan. The Henan region is organized by the Bank of Communications, and nine production and marketing cooperatives have been established, distributed in Taikang, Zhangde, Wujin, and Yuncheng in Henan Province, lending only more than 15,000 yuan for utilization loans. The Hebei region is organized by the Jincheng Bank, and 13 cooperatives have been established, distributed in Handan, Anci, and other counties, making production loans of more than 36,000 yuan. According to statistics, there are 29 cooperatives in the three regions, and a total of more than 600,000 yuan has been loaned out for various purposes.</p>
<p>Next Year's Plan</p>
<p>The second phase will be the cotton field transportation and sales loans in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi, with a transportation and sales loan of 750,000 yuan in Shaanxi, a transportation and sales loan of 150,000 yuan in Henan, a transportation and sales loan of 110,000 yuan in Shanxi, and a transportation and sales loan of 60,000 yuan in Hebei, totaling 1.07 million yuan. Now, the new flowers in various provinces have long been on the market, and transportation and sales are very busy and will be completed soon. As for the loans for the 24th year of the Republic, they will be completed at the end of this month, and will be completely completed by the end of March next year. Including the previous loans, the total amount of various loans is more than 1.7 million yuan, while the original plan was 3 million yuan. This is because the initial establishment was very cautious, resulting in insufficient amount. However, the results in various regions have been quite effective. The new plan for the 25th year of the Republic will be jointly determined after the end of this year at the board meeting. It is heard that the total amount of loans will be increased again and the loan area will be expanded.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Municipal Land Bureau Urges Collection of Practice Certificates; A Custody Fee Will Be Charged for Those Who Fail to Collect Them After the Deadline <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau issues land practice certificates in units of maps. After a map of a certain district has been measured, a public notice will be published and certificates will be issued on a regular basis. However, after the owners submit the drawings for signature, the certificates and maps have been prepared early, and there are often delays of many years, and those who do not collect them have accumulated to more than 10,000 sheets. After repeated public notices urging collection, they still do not comply. If a method is not determined, it is feared that the certificates and maps will accumulate more and more, and storage will become an obstacle. Moreover, the new certificates are being rushed to be made at present, and it is planned to completely fill out and issue more than 5,000 copies of land certificates that have not been made in the shortest possible time, in order to clear up the accumulated cases. In the future, the mapping and certificate making should be expedited. If there is not enough time during the day, it will be followed by night. The work is very tense, so the people who come to the bureau to exchange and collect certificates are increasing day by day. All the owners who have not collected their certificates for a long time have heard that the Land Bureau has formulated a method to urge collection within a time limit, and a custody fee will be charged for those who exceed the time limit, in order to crack down on them. It has been submitted to the municipal government for approval, and a public notice will be issued and implemented on an appointed day. The methods proposed by the Bureau are first recorded as follows: (1) People who have submitted the old slips to the Bureau to exchange certificates, hold receipts, and have signed and submitted the drawings to the Bureau for more than three months, their land certificates have been prepared long ago. They are now limited to December 31, 24th year of the Republic, to bring the receipts to the certificate issuance room of the Bureau in Fenglinqiao to collect the certificates. (2) Those who still fail to collect them after the deadline will be charged a custody fee of two cents per certificate per month, which will be collected when they collect the certificates in the future. If it is less than one month, it will be counted as one month.</p>

<p>Passed the Payment of Municipal Administrative Expenses at 80%; Elected Wu Yunzhai to Attend the Road Construction Fee Custody Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council held a regular meeting yesterday. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Boqi, Qin Runqing, Wang Yansong, Lu Jingshi, Liu Zhanen, Wu Yunzhai, Wang Yiting, Guo Shun, Du Yuesheng, Xu Yongzuo, and more than ten other people attended. Chairman Tu Xiaolai presided over the meeting. After the report was completed, the meeting began. (1) The Municipal Government replied to the letter requesting the construction of a meeting hall, requesting that a plan be devised under the heading of surplus funds. It was resolved that another storage should be made, and Qian Xinzhi, Wang Yansong, and Qin Runqing were elected as the three councillors to keep the funds. (2) The Municipal Government's administrative expenses, starting from December of this year, will be paid at 80% of the approved amount. It was resolved that the council had requested the municipal government in June of last year, in the case of increasing the urban housing donation and vehicle donation, to economize on the original administrative expenses starting from the 23rd year, assuming that 80% was the standard. Now, this case, except for police and education expenses, is paid at 80% across the board, which is in line with the council's original resolution. The case was passed as it was. (3) Councillor Wang Yiting proposed to reduce the road construction levy regulations to alleviate the people's difficulties. It was resolved that the municipal government should be requested to consider the current market situation and reduce the engineering fee levy rate in Article 11 of the Shanghai Road Construction Levy Regulations, and there should also be a fair standard for the evaluation of real estate donations to avoid bias. (4) Councillor Wu Yunzhai was elected to represent the council to attend the Shanghai Road Construction Fee Custody Committee. (5) Regarding housing rent matters, a meeting will be scheduled to review them, and a temporary motion will be made to request the municipal government to submit the budget documents for the 24th year for review as soon as possible.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Xinda Flour Co., Ltd. on Macau Road was established in the 11th year of the Republic, and the general manager is Sun Binnan. The Fortress Brand and Sanduo Brand flour produced by the company are sold in the country and the Nanyang Valley and the business is quite prosperous. Recently, affected by the economic downturn, a notice was suddenly posted at the door yesterday, announcing the temporary suspension of business, and entrusting lawyer Zhang Zhirang and accountant Xi Yushu to organize the accounts. It is reported that the company's debts owed to others are sufficient to offset each other. This sudden announcement of closure, after the accounts are organized, will cooperate with a major flour mill. In addition, Xinyuan Warehouse Co., Ltd. on Macau Road, established in the 3rd year of the Republic, specializes in storing goods and has always been known for its reputation. It is the largest warehouse closest to the Maigen Road freight station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The general manager is also Sun Binnan, and it also closed yesterday. A notice was posted at the door stating that the company was temporarily closed due to market influences and entrusted lawyers Weng Zhifan and Xie Fanglin, and accountant Shen Liren to organize the accounts.

<p>Since the successive reports of major floods in the Yangtze River and rivers, the Renji Road Chinese and Foreign Relief Association has been sending urgent relief in various ways. However, the Yangtze River has calmed down but the river water has risen, the affected area has expanded, and the disaster period has been extended. From autumn to winter, relief is overwhelming. When the urgent relief has not yet ended, unexpectedly the weather is cold again, and all the disaster-stricken areas have requested winter relief again. They are all in critical condition and cannot be delayed. In addition to distributing 98 boxes and 1,700 pieces of clothing sold earlier, another 30,000 sets of new cotton clothing were made, which were divided into 6,000 sets for Shandong, 4,000 sets for Peixian, 4,000 sets for Suqian, 4,000 sets for Haizhou, and 12,000 sets for Tianmen, Yichang, and Laohekou in Hubei Province. In addition to the more than 270,000 yuan already allocated for urgent relief in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Guangdong, winter relief has now been allocated, including 5,000 yuan for Haizhou, 5,000 yuan for Tianmen, 2,000 yuan for Shandong, 2,000 yuan for Xuzhou, 3,000 yuan for Laohekou in Hubei, 3,000 yuan for Huoqiu in Anhui, and 2,500 yuan for Qingjiangpu Puhui Congee Factory, all of which have been remitted to various disaster areas to meet the timely needs.</p>

<p>Insufficient to Prove Financial Panic; Also Not a Special Phenomenon This Year</p>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, yesterday. According to recent reports in various newspapers in Shanghai, various commercial banks have been exchanging with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and it is said that this is due to the year-end being near and financial stress. I believe that this kind of narrative seems too serious. Commercial banks exchanging with state banks at the end of the year happens every year and is not surprising. Moreover, commercial banks also have deposits in state banks during peacetime. It is only natural to withdraw them at this time. According to the commercial habits of banks, every year-end, at the time of settlement, profitable banks should naturally compensate for loss-making banks. Therefore, this kind of exchange is a normal phenomenon and not a special situation at the end of this year, let alone a serious manifestation of commercial panic.</p>

<p>Following the U.S. cessation of silver purchases, the London silver market has plummeted.  The Shanghai Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee yesterday morning announced a low balance tax rate. The Jianghai Customs announced the confiscation of silver smuggled abroad.  Silver exports from our country have ceased. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silver Price Plunge Does Not Affect Us</p>
<p>Following the U.S. government's cessation of silver purchases, the price of silver in the London market plummeted. Trading was suspended at the exchange. A reporter from the "Newspaper Agency" (新聲社) specifically visited Secretary-General Lin of the Shanghai Bankers Association yesterday morning. According to him, since the implementation of the new currency policy, silver can no longer be used, and a standard foreign exchange price has been set. For example, one national currency unit (國幣) is equivalent to one shilling and two and a half pence in British currency. The London market's suffering from the U.S. cessation of silver purchases, causing the silver price to plummet, will not affect our country's industry and commerce, and so on.  Also, at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced the balance tax rate as 47.25%, lower than before.</p>
<p>Silver Exports Have Ceased</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency policy on November 4th, the balance tax rate announced by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee has not only been no less than the theoretically required balance tax rate but has sometimes exceeded it. For example, on November 4th, the theoretically taxable balance tax was 56.98%. The balance tax announced on that day was 57.25%. On the 5th, the theoretically taxable amount was 58.05%, and the announced amount was 58.50%. For every hundred yuan exported from Shanghai to London, in addition to bearing the balance tax, freight, and insurance costs, there was also a loss of 27 cents to 1 yuan and 34 cents. Under these normal circumstances, formally exporting silver has become impossible. Therefore, silver exports from our country have ceased.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silver Deposit Report for Last Week</p>
<p>A "Newspaper Agency" (新聲社) reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that the silver reserves in Shanghai last week, as of November 28th of this year, were 8,090,000 taels, 294,540,000 yuan, at a rate of 7.98. As of November 29th of last year, they were 33,430,000 taels, 296,540,000 yuan, at a rate of 7.980. Among the above silver reserves, the deposits in Chinese merchant banks as of November 28th of this year were 5,000,000 taels, 250,440,000 yuan, at a rate of 7.980. As of November 29th of last year, they were 15,130,000 taels, 256,080,000 yuan, at a rate of 7.980.</p>
<p>Customs Announcement: Confiscation for Smuggling</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs Announcement No. 1485 regarding the payment of silver export tax and balance tax for the transportation or carrying of silver wares and silver ornaments abroad states, "According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, 'Merchants transporting or passengers carrying silver wares and silver ornaments out of customs shall pay a silver export tax of 10% ad valorem and a balance tax; violators will be confiscated,' etc." Accordingly, it should be obeyed. All merchants are hereby notified. This announcement is issued on December 11th, 24th year of the Republic of China.  Superintendent Tang Haian, Customs Commissioner Ba Runsen.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Two Chambers of Commerce Request the Ministry of Industry to Allocate Funds to Subsidize the Construction of a Chinese Pavilion at the Dutch East Indies Exhibition <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating, "Regarding the holding of the Dutch East Indies National Products Exhibition, requesting the allocation of funds to subsidize the construction of a Chinese pavilion." The letter from the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry states, "According to the report from the Dutch East Indies Chinese Chamber of Commerce Federation regarding the Singapore Chinese National Products Exhibition this year, which was deeply welcomed by overseas Chinese, the Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Delegation plans to hold a tour exhibition in various parts of Nanyang in April next year to expand the sales of national products in Nanyang. Our association plans to build a Chinese pavilion in Kampong Baru (干必浦) in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, in order to hold a national products exhibition during the night market period there in August next year. However, this matter requires national product manufacturers to take advantage of their return to China to discuss it. We request that you inform the manufacturers of this matter and instruct them to handle it," etc. The matter concerns the development of trade with Nanyang. Therefore, we especially inform you to investigate and summon various national product manufacturer groups to discuss the matter thoroughly with Consul General Song, etc. In response, the affiliated associations immediately summoned the major factories in Shanghai and discussed it with Consul General Song. As a result, regarding inviting manufacturers to participate in the exhibition, the affiliated associations will schedule a meeting of all manufacturers in Shanghai to organize a solicitation committee to prepare and carry out all matters. However, regarding the cost of building the Chinese pavilion, at a time when Shanghai's industry and commerce are in extreme decline, manufacturers are unable to bear it. It is necessary to sincerely request the government to allocate funds to subsidize it, so as to achieve success," etc., which is recorded in the minutes. The affiliated associations received a letter on November 5th from the Dutch East Indies Chinese Chamber of Commerce Federation, the Dutch East Indies Chinese Importers Association, and the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce Federation, stating that the construction cost of the Chinese pavilion would be the largest expense for this exhibition, and other expenses would also be considerable. However, regarding the entry tax to be paid by each manufacturer representative participating in the exhibition and the import permits for goods, Consul General Song can be asked to be responsible for contacting the Immigration Bureau and the Ministry of Economy of the Dutch East Indies government. The round-trip tickets for the representatives between Batavia and Shanghai can also be arranged by Consul General Song with the Java Shipping Company to obtain a 50% discount. Overseas Chinese merchants in Batavia are willing to raise between 1,000 and 3,000 guilders to subsidize part of the expenses of the exhibition. This shows that the associations are extremely enthusiastic about this exhibition. The affiliated associations share the same boat and should work together to handle it.

<h3 id="e89">Ministry of Finance Issues Clarification on Stamp Tax Law; Receipts, Passbooks, and Insurance Policies <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously summarized and requested instructions from the Ministry of Finance regarding many unresolved issues that various businesses had researched based on actual circumstances since the implementation of the Stamp Tax Law. Now, the Ministry of Finance's approval No. 8058 You states, "A telegram from Jiang on September has been received. Upon investigation: (1) Silver or goods receipts should be stamped by the issuer according to law. If stores provide delivery books or silver books for the convenience of the recipients to stamp or sign, and the stores have already affixed sufficient stamps to the books according to the book regulations, then the recipients do not need to affix stamps individually. (2) Passbooks should be stamped annually with 20 cents according to law. For current deposit passbooks, or passbooks for lump-sum deposits and withdrawals, or lump-sum deposits with periodic interest payments, when the time comes for adding new stamps, the banks can affix the stamps when depositing, withdrawing, or paying interest. For lump-sum deposit passbooks, deposit slips are mostly used, and only 2 cents of stamps are affixed according to item 4 of the tax rate table, and there is no need to add stamps annually, so there is no problem. (3) Regarding insurance policies, according to the explanation of the nature column of item 27 of the Stamp Tax Law tax rate table, if a document insures that a certain fact will not occur regarding a certain matter, stamps should be affixed. When transferring shares or other rights, the documents issued by the transferee to the company, bank, or related third party, such as share transfer certificates, etc., which guarantee that there will be no disputes in the future regarding the transfer, should be handled according to the insurance policy regulations."</p>

<h3 id="e94">Rickshaw Puller License Fee: 20 Cents in National Currency <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the report of the Vehicle Committee to the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the donation and issuance of new licenses to self-employed rickshaw pullers is progressing smoothly, but it is somewhat slow. 16,000 licenses have been issued, and donations up to the 2nd of this month totaled 5,003. The Rickshaw Special Committee suggested that from January 1st of the following year, self-employed rickshaw pullers should donate and obtain licenses, and from that day onwards, the license fee should be increased from the current 50 cents of the local dollar to 1 yuan. The Board of Directors approved this. The Vehicle Committee also suggested that the new licenses for public rickshaw pullers should be calculated from January 1st of the following year to determine the actual number of pullers, and argued that if the license fee is determined to be 50 cents, this fee should be paid by the mutual aid association to reduce the direct hardship on the pullers. Some said that the original rickshaw puller license fee in the French Concession was only 20 cents in local currency, but others said that the benefits of the Public Concession license were greater. The head of the Donation Office immediately stated that he was ordered by the head of the Finance Office to express his active desire that the Vehicle Committee's budget for 1936 should not exceed the amount spent this year. He also said that if the license fee is reduced to 20 cents, the budget for the following year should be increased by 12,000 yuan. After discussion, the Special Committee suggested to the Council that the new licenses for public rickshaw pullers should be calculated from January 1st of the following year, and the new license fee should be set at 50 cents of the local dollar, to be continued to be paid by the mutual aid association. The Special Committee's suggestion was discussed in detail by the Board of Directors a few days ago. As a result, the license fee was decided to be changed to 20 cents of the local dollar, because it was the general consensus that this fee should be reduced to the lowest limit. With this point amended, the minutes of the Special Committee's meeting were immediately approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Rickshaw Committee's Proposal to Punish Rickshaw Owners for Overcharging Rickshaw Tax <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting on Wednesday afternoon and adopted the following recommendation from the Special Rickshaw Committee:</p>
<p>"The Special Rickshaw Committee's policy of suspending the license of any owner who overcharges rickshaw rent is hereby approved. The owner's request for appeal should be rejected, and the Rickshaw Committee should be authorized to permanently revoke the license in serious cases. Owners who are only subject to suspension of their licenses should continue to pay the fee in order to enjoy the benefits of this license recorded by the Council."</p>
<p>This matter was first reported by the Rickshaw Committee to the Special Rickshaw Committee on December 2nd. The report stated that there was a sharp wave of opposition to overcharging rickshaw rent in November. This was because the price of silver subsidiary currency increased after the Ministry of Finance promulgated the currency system measures on the 4th of that month. At that time, the Vehicle Committee issued a notice advising rickshaw pullers to pay rickshaw rent in local dollars, and informing them that according to the market price on that day, the highest legal rickshaw rent for half a day (i.e., each shift) was 40 cents in small dollars and 28 copper coins. After this notice was issued, rickshaw pullers reported overcharging. As a result of disciplinary investigations, 92 out of 156 owners were punished, 140 licenses were suspended for one month, and nine licenses were suspended for two months. The Rickshaw Committee strongly argued in its report that if this exploitation continues unabated, those who repeatedly offend should have their licenses revoked, and the authority to handle this should be granted to the Rickshaw Committee. According to the report of the Rickshaw Committee plenary session to the Special Committee, after the Vehicle Committee temporarily suspended several licenses, representatives of the owners came to the meeting to request leniency. They were immediately told that the matter had already been reported and could not be withdrawn, and could only wait for the Council's decision. However, the suspension of licenses could continue to be applied until the date of the Council meeting, that is, between December 6th and 10th. Owners without licenses would not be punished. The Vehicle Committee also promised to convey the owners' opinions to the Special Committee. It was found that each case was carefully considered and often took more than an hour of investigation before a conclusion could be reached. The chairman immediately asked whether there were any obvious violations of the Council's measures among the violators. Mr. Massey said that such things only happened occasionally. He said that under normal circumstances, those who profited from the decline in exchange rates were not the owners and pullers, but the contractors. However, the Bureau could only punish the licensed owners and let them transfer the consequences to the contractors of all sizes. Mr. Zhu Maozhen then said that the plan was to allow owners who overcharged rickshaw rent to voluntarily pay a fine of 10 local dollars per license to offset the overcharge. In other words, if the overcharged rickshaw rent was 180 yuan, the appropriate measure would be to suspend at least 18 licenses. The money paid by the owners would be directly paid to the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, as it was impossible to return it to the pullers who paid too much rickshaw rent. A member of the Special Committee believed that the Vehicle Committee's plan was feasible, and according to reports, the pullers sometimes said that passengers were becoming increasingly scarce due to the economic downturn, and some were afraid to rent vehicles because they were afraid that the rickshaw fare would not be enough to pay the rent. The head of the Finance and Donation Office suggested that in the future, owners who are punished for overcharging rickshaw rent should have their licenses completely revoked or be required to pay the fee as usual during the suspension period as the price for the Council to record the license. Everyone felt that this measure should be implemented in the future, because it is necessary to have strict measures to completely eliminate the overcharging of rickshaw rent. Therefore, the above-mentioned suggestions were submitted to the Council by the Special Committee for adoption.</p>

<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Union in this city has always taken serving the community as its responsibility. With the arrival of winter, the streets are full of beggars, especially women and children. They beg from everyone and sleep in the open air, exposed to the wind and rain. This is not only inhumane, but also gives a bad impression internationally. Although the Union has a Women and Children's Education Center in Jiangwan and a temporary shelter at No. 2 Fude Road, most of these illiterate people do not know the location of these organizations that are beneficial to them. Seeing this, the Union specially organized a beggar relief team a few days ago, entrusting Ms. Wu Zhiqing, director of the Union's social service department, Mrs. Cai Bingjiu, and Ms. Liu Juxian, director of the Women and Children's Education Center, to be responsible for preparing everything. They will depart soon and will carry beggar relief certificates to distribute to women and children beggars.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, Nakamura Sueko, a beautiful and talented Japanese woman, the leader of a pirate gang entrenched on Zhongnan Island in the South China Sea of ​​Fujian, who married Chen Bailin of Taiwan as a concubine and robbed passing ships, was reported by the Fuzhou Consul General's Police Department and ordered to return to her country. She arrived in Shanghai on the 11th aboard the merchant ship Shengjing Maru and was escorted to the Japanese Consulate Police Department in this port. She is scheduled to be escorted to Yokohama on the Tatsuta Maru, a postal ship leaving on the 14th. It is reported that this woman is twenty-seven years old, beautiful and talented, and is from Kutsugata Village, Rishiri County, Soya Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan. For several years, she has led hundreds of pirates, appearing and disappearing in the seas of Southeast Asia. The number of freighters robbed is unknown. With her keen mind and proficiency in shooting, she is greatly admired by her subordinates. Later, due to repeated military suppression, her subordinates scattered. Last autumn, she secretly returned to Japan from Hong Kong via Taiwan with more than 35,000 yuan in cash. This spring, she returned to the bandit den. Her whereabouts are elusive, sometimes disguised as a Chinese female student. This time, she was suddenly recognized on the Japanese ship Changsha Maru and fled to the captain's cabin, begging for protection. The captain, Hida, telegraphed the Fuzhou Consulate.</p>

<p>Qiu, a Ningbo native and concubine of Fan Dinghua, a comprador of the Former Sanbei Company, resides at No. 6, Xinping Lane, Longmen Road. She has no children and keeps two maids, one named Meiying, twelve years old, and the other named Shundi, only ten years old. Qiu is naturally violent. If the two girls slightly disobey her, she whips them. Shundi is younger and slower in doing things, which leads to even more abuse. A few days ago, she became ill as a result, and medical treatment was ineffective. She died in the afternoon the day before yesterday. Qiu suddenly ordered her maid Zhu to place the body in an empty room to be carried out at the appropriate time. Unexpectedly, this was suddenly discovered by someone, who reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station in charge by telephone, ordering detective Wang Shanqing, patrolman Wang Tiancheng, and others to rush to the address to investigate. Qiu and her maid did not admit that there was a dead child in the house. Then the detectives saw that a room was locked. They obtained the key from Zhu. Just as they were opening it, Qiu and her maid knew it was difficult to hide, and took the opportunity to escape together without a trace. The detectives could only carry the child's body to the Ferran Road Mortuary. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, together with Wei, Zhang, two forensic doctors, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. First, the detectives reported the previous situation, and then Fang Chen, 47 years old, from Ningbo, who works as a nanny there, testified that the deceased was bought as a maid in December last year. She was often beaten by her mistress Fan Qiu because she did not do her work well. However, she often used leather shoes to hit her very hard. In the past ten days, the child had not been beaten because of illness. Xin Shen testified that she lives in the pavilion room there and makes a living by washing clothes. She had seen the deceased being beaten by her mistress twice. Recently, the child suddenly became ill. When she asked about it, they said she was suffering from consumption. Yesterday afternoon, she saw the maid Zhu burning paper money and learned that the child had died. After Tang heard the testimony, he declared that the deceased was killed by continuous injury and malnutrition. Since there were no family members, the body was handed over to Pushan Villa for collection. Fan Qiu is suspected of causing death by injury and should be investigated by the police station in charge and brought to justice.</p>

<p>Wang Awei, from Zhejiang Shanhua County, makes a living by selling beef sauce chicken, etc. His wife, Cao, 39 years old, lives with him at No. 423, Weihawei Road. They have a son and a daughter, both of whom are young. Unfortunately, the boy suddenly fell ill and died. Therefore, in September this year, they spent ten yuan to adopt a two-year-old boy as their son, named Lai Fa. However, because Cao was naturally violent, she discriminated against Lai Fa. If he slightly disobeyed her, she would whip him, causing crying that was often heard. Jin Guangyu, a ledger room manager on the street, who was a close neighbor of Cao, felt injustice and reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station in charge. The Chinese and foreign detectives sent to investigate found that it was true. They arrested Wang Cao and sent Lai Fa to Baolong Hospital. Because he was seriously injured, medical treatment was ineffective, and he died the next day. The body was sent to the mortuary. The prosecutor of the Special Court had already examined and determined that Lai Fa had indeed been beaten to death before his death. Wang Cao was suspected of committing a crime, and the police station filed a lawsuit with the court. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Wang Cao to the Criminal Court Eight of the First Special Court and formally filed a lawsuit against her for the crime of causing death by injury under Article 277, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stood up and stated the case, saying that according to the report of the forensic doctor, it was found that the legs of the young child Lai Fa were swollen and had blood clots, and there were seven or eight wounds on his buttocks. There was skin peeling on the top of his head, and there were five or six wounds. There were six or seven wounds on his cheekbones, and there were wounds on both wrists and arms. Overall, there were many wounds on his body, which were caused by continuous blunt instrument injuries and wounds. He was indeed beaten to death before his death. Therefore, the defendant in this case should be held criminally liable and requested to be punished according to the law. When questioned, the defendant Wang Cao confessed that Lai Fa was indeed the son she adopted and that she had not abused him on weekdays. Although she had beaten him once, it was just a trivial matter. This time, Lai Fa suddenly fell ill, and it seemed that he was frightened.

<h3 id="e108">City Government Orders the Public Security Bureau to Advise Citizens to Pay Attention to Fire Safety Equipment <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government believes that fire safety equipment is of great importance to the safety of residents. The city is densely populated, and every time a fire occurs, it will suffer great losses. In the past, there were rubber and celluloid factories, and now there are tragedies such as those on Huminnan Road and Nan Zha Road in the Nanshi, Dongzha and Laobei Road, and Yanhai Road, which have caused the deaths of several people. If we pay attention to fire safety equipment on weekdays, how could this happen? Therefore, based on the four principles of economy, simplicity, convenience, and effectiveness, it is believed that the newly invented Zhenggda Golden Bell brand fire extinguishing powder is the most suitable. It has ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to advise the people to adopt it uniformly and provide assistance in promoting it. It is reported that the powder was invented by Yu Jiesan and approved for patent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. A factory was opened in Beiping, and public trials were conducted in Pingjin, Jinji and other places, and the speed of fire extinguishing has achieved excellent results. Recently, a branch preparation office and distribution office have been established in Jixiang Street, Shanghai. Shi Bingyan and Jin Yichen have been appointed as the general deputy managers of South China to prepare for everything and will soon begin operations. At that time, they also plan to select a suitable location to entertain local news and other sectors for public trials.</p>

<p>Younger Brother Kidnapped</p>
<p>At about 8:10 yesterday morning, Kelong and his sister Huiying took a chartered car to school.

Because the participants are all fellow villagers of Hushe, the men or women mostly live in their original places, and it takes time to travel back and forth for contact, so the society now extends the registration period to the 20th of this month at the request of the participants. The wedding book used and the souvenirs given to the married people are also extremely luxurious. The groom's dress is undertaken by Fuhe Silk Store, using Wuxing Silk Factory products, which are set by the Jiangsu Provincial Government Dr. Ni Yun,</p>

<p>The Chengyu Store, located at No. 49-51, Bali Bridge Road (i.e., West Xinqiao Street), French Concession, and opened by Liu Yushan from Sichuan, specializes in selling local products from Western Sichuan. Recently, the store sold a kind of Jintang cigar, a local product of Sichuan. The transported Shanghai selling cigar is similar to the popular Small Green Tree brand on the market, but slightly shorter, with 100 cigars per box. Because the store did not report to the Tobacco Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance for tax payment and purchase of stamps, it was discovered by the Tobacco Inspection Office of the French Concession. The store was accused of privately selling unreported and untaxed cigars, which is in violation of the relevant regulations. The Western Detective Wu Yaoou (transliteration) led Chinese Detectives Zhou Baosheng, Zhu Qiming, and Zhao Chengen to search the store. Two hundred and eighty boxes of Jintang cigars were confiscated, and account books were found recording that 12 boxes, each containing 2,800 cigars, totaling 33,600 cigars, were shipped from Sichuan. 5,900 cigars were sold, and 27,600 cigars were in stock.

After Judge Sun Pengxian conducted a preliminary hearing, he ordered that Liu Yushan of Chengyu Store be summoned to court for further questioning on the 16th because the store owner had not arrived.</p>

<h3 id="e128">A Record of Visiting the Watson Electric Appliance Factory <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We are already quite familiar with the term "electric world." Some people say that the industries of European, American, and Japanese powers can prosper, mostly because the electrical industry has reached a stage of full development. It can be seen that "electricity and industry" are inseparable. To expand on this, electricity is the mother of all construction industries. If we acknowledge this, we think of China's electrical industry. Unfortunately, China is too backward. Except for a small number of machine industries using electricity, most handicraft industries are still struggling with human and animal power? And are not all electrical appliances sourced from abroad? In recent years, several commercial electrical factories have been working hard to regain some of the lost rights. Among them, "Watson" is the giant. In order to make the Chinese people understand its contents, this newspaper specially sent reporters to visit and introduce Watson's details as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Process of Visiting Watson</p>
<p>First, this newspaper agreed with Mr. Ye Youcai on the morning of the 9th of this month for a visit. When the time came, the reporter and Mr. Jin Huating drove to the Watson General Management Office on Fujian Road. It was learned that Mr. Ye had gone out for urgent business and specially sent Mr. Lu Zhongxian and Mr. Xu Qiaoqi to receive us. It is said that Watson has six branch factories in Shanghai and four branch factories in Nanxiang. Shanghai focuses on manufacturing electric fans. The Nanxiang branch factories manufacture all kinds of electrical appliances. Due to time constraints, we decided to visit the first factory (old factory) and the second factory (new factory) on Zhoujiazui Road first, and then go to Nanxiang. After the plan was set, the four of us set off in two cars. After visiting the two factories, it was already past 12 o'clock, and we drove to Nanxiang. We first had lunch at the electrical appliance company, which is named "Shengming" and is also operated by Watson. During the meal, most of the conversations were about Watson's past and present goodness. After the meal, we continued to visit the four branch factories until 3:30 pm before returning to Shanghai in the same car. What excited us most was that Watson, which has been around for twenty years, has expanded from a small workshop with a capital of 100,000 yuan to ten branch factories with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. The products have increased from meters to various electrical appliances. The sales channels have expanded from Shanghai to the whole country and the South Seas Islands. The number of employees has increased from a dozen to more than 500. In China, which is plagued by internal and external troubles, it has developed to such an extent that we cannot but admire the talents, cooperative spirit, and hard work of Mr. Ye Youcai, Yuan Zongyao, and Yang Jichuan.</p>
<p>(2) A Brief History of the Watson Electric Appliance Factory</p>
<p>In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ye Youcai, Yuan Zongyao, and Yang Jichuan witnessed the influx of foreign goods and the outflow of interests, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. They deeply felt pain and determined to abandon their original professions, sacrifice their personal rights, explore electrical science, and study the electrical appliance industry. They resolutely initiated preparations, setting up in several pawnshops next to Henghama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, hiring six or seven workers, slightly specializing in organization, and naming it Watson Electric Appliance Factory. Specializing in the manufacture of small electrical appliances, such as limit meters, ammeters, voltmeters, and various switches. At that time, there were no technical talents, so they all operated in person. In less than half a year, the sales of products gradually developed. So they added a mother machine, increased workers, and moved to Zhaofeng Road. The scope was slightly larger, so they added the manufacture of generators. Because the products were of good quality, they were well received by the society. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, they built their own factory building on Zhoujiazui Road and purchased important mother machines from foreign countries. By the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the number of workers had increased to more than 300, and more than 100 machines had been added. They strived for perfection internally and added the manufacture of various electric fans, which were sold at home and abroad, and developed day by day. In the eighteenth year, the scientific management method was adopted. In the twentieth year, more than 100 acres of land were purchased in Zhenru, in order to build the main factory, open the Watson New Village, workers' residences, public auditoriums, clubs, and cooperatives. In the twenty-second year, electrical factories, motor factories, screw factories, and iron foundries were established in Nanxiang. In the twenty-third year, the general management office was established and moved to Fujian Road. The internal organization was divided into departments, each in charge of its own affairs and performing its own duties. This is a summary of Watson's history of twenty years.</p>
<p>(3) The Output of Each Factory</p>
<p>Watson Electric Appliance Factory is divided into six factories in Shanghai: two on Zhoujiazui Road, one on Zhongshan Road, one on Kangnaot Road, one on Xiaoshadu Road, and one on Binlang Road. The above six factories completely manufacture electric fans—ceiling fans and desk fans. These two types of electric fans can produce 200 units a day. In Nanxiang, it is divided into four factories: (1) Substation type, box type, vehicle type, and table type (four types) transformers, meters, circuit breakers, lightning arresters, welding machines, and household electrical appliances. In recent years, many factories across the country have ordered electrical appliances and railway bureaus have ordered train fans in large numbers. (2) Huacheng Motor Factory specializes in manufacturing generators, with the smallest horsepower ranging from one-quarter horsepower to fifty horsepower and one hundred horsepower. There are AC generators, DC generators, and magnetic generators. Ten generators can be manufactured every day. In the past, Chinese people could not manufacture them themselves, and they all relied on foreign goods, which were priced expensively and difficult to purchase. Since Watson manufactured them themselves, the sales of foreign goods have gradually decreased, and the pricing has been reduced by nearly half. Moreover, Chinese people can now manufacture motors, and Watson is not the only one. (3) Liancheng Screw Factory specializes in manufacturing various copper and iron machine screws, and provides custom manufacturing of various sizes. It is said that 200 barrels of goods can be shipped every day. (4) Hualian Iron Foundry. (5) Shengming Electric Factory, which supplies electricity to the above four factories.</p>
<p>(4) The Raw Materials and Manufacturing Method of Electric Fans</p>
<p>When we were at the two branch factories on Zhoujiazui Road, we carefully studied the method of manufacturing electric fans and learned that the success of an electric fan requires eleven projects and more than 500 procedures. For example, for copper blades, the whole piece of copper sheet is first divided into strips, made into blades, polished, polished, sprayed with paint, painted, waxed, and then assembled, at least more than ten procedures. Therefore, both ceiling fans and desk fans must go through eleven projects: (1) mold making (2) punching (3) stamping shell (4) suction iron (5) painting (6) winding wire (7) ceiling installation (8) table installation (9) fan cover (10) motor head (11) wooden leaves. This is like a grain of rice. You don't know how much sweat and blood you have to shed to grow it. Now when we mention the four words "Watson Electric Fan", we all admit that it is a high-quality domestic product, and the products are indeed excellent. Its electric fans are divided into three grades: fastest, second fastest, and slowest. There are 56-inch and 36-inch four-blade AC and DC ceiling fans, 36-inch three-blade ceiling fans, and 12-inch and 16-inch AC and DC table and wall dual-purpose oscillating fans. According to the explanation, there are two new products next year, which are the latest invention of the Chinese people and have obtained a five-year patent from the Ministry of Industry. (1) A new type of ceiling fan that blows wind horizontally, so that the surrounding area under the ceiling fan has a cool breeze blowing on the face; (2) A new type of desk fan that becomes a four-sided rotating type; Compared with the current angular three-sided fan, there is naturally significant progress. As for the raw materials of electric fans, Watson gives priority to using domestic products. If they have to use foreign products, they only buy raw materials and manufacture them completely themselves. For example, the leaf board of ceiling fans is only available in Finland. The wire ball and coil are from the United Kingdom and Germany. The copper leaves of table fans are also British goods. In addition, iron, paint, and wool are domestic products, so electric fans are still considered second-class domestic products.</p>
<p>(5) The Training and Treatment of Employees</p>
<p>The Watson factory has about 100 staff members and more than 400 workers. Since the implementation of scientific management in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the staff and workers have been united and working hard to produce. The Nanxiang branch factory pays more attention to training. For example, there are morning exercises in the morning, amateur sports and fire protection group training, evening schools at night, and lectures on electricity from time to time. They all feel very happy spiritually. The worker's residence next to the factory can also accommodate family members, and the monthly fee for food is six and a half yuan per person. The daily life facilities are fairly complete. Generally, the daily wage is at least six cents and up to two yuan. In this period of economic downturn, when there is a trend of salary cuts and wage arrears everywhere, Watson's treatment is indeed rare.</p>
<p>(6) Watson's Path to Success</p>
<p>After visiting Watson, the reporter expressed his admiration for their spirit of cooperation and managing a great undertaking in a very economical way. In addition, I have gained two more insights into China's industry:</p>
<p>First: No matter what industry, whether it is internal or external, as long as you study hard, there is no reason not to succeed. The three founders of "Watson" used to engage in other businesses. Electrical science was not their specialty. They relied entirely on their talent to explore the truth and bury their heads for many years, and finally achieved an immortal career, worthy of the model of young people.</p>
<p>Second: Cooperation is the mother of success and a necessary factor for developing a career. The spirit of cooperation of Mr. Ye, Yuan, and Yang has been the same for twenty years, which is a major reason for Watson's amazing progress. I would like to tell the Chinese people that whether you are studying, governing, working, or doing business, you must have these two spirits, and the country will have hope!</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao, I respectfully write to inform you that while I was traveling in Hangzhou on the ninth, I read in your newspaper's local news column that I was listed as a representative from Singapore attending the Fifth National Congress, which is not true. My return to China this time is purely a personal matter and does not involve any other tasks. My travels are coming to an end, and I will return overseas soon. I dare to request that you correct this based on the facts to avoid any misunderstandings. I respectfully inform you of this and wish you peace. Your humble servant, Zhuang Butang, December 11, 1935, from No. 57 Heping Lane, Baibao Road, North Sichuan Road, this city. To Whom It May Concern, the news report yesterday about a certain foreigner suing me in court is slightly inconsistent with the facts. I have never signed any contract with any foreigner. My defense attorney, lawyer Jin Ximin, stated in court that the cause of the report yesterday is unknown. I am deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings and hope that you will grant a correction. I will be extremely grateful. Respectfully, Zhang Siyun of Hongyu Pharmacy Shanghai Office, December 12.</p>

<p>—Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Jo only said a few words, they all knew the severity of the situation and did as she said as quickly as possible. In less than ten minutes, Mr. Bhaer and Mr. Laurence had reached the woods, and Franz, riding old Untie, galloped into the prairie to search everywhere. Mrs. Jo followed her, while the others waited quietly at home. She rode Rabbit again, running away, still having time to put on a hat or shawl. She heard someone seem to be chasing closely behind, but she didn't say a word until she stopped to listen carefully, and the light from her lamp shone on Dan's face.</p>
<p>"You're here! I want to liberate the guest," she said, as if still wanting him to go back, although she was in desperate need of help at the time.</p>
<p>"I don't want him to go, he and Amy haven't even had dinner yet, my desire to come is stronger than theirs," he said, and took the lamp from her hand, smiling at her, but with a determined spirit in his eyes, making her feel that although he was a child, she also had someone to rely on in times of need.</p>
<p>She jumped down, ordering him to ride Rabbit. He initially asked to walk, but finally had to obey; so the two walked together along the dusty and vibrant path, stopping from time to time to call out, or holding their breath to listen for small voices answering.</p>

<p>The China Football Association's Group A match between You You and Guanghua, originally scheduled for the 4th, was postponed due to rain and was held yesterday at 3 PM at Shen Garden on Yanping Road. The weather was cold, and there were few spectators. You You, relying on their talented team, fought to a 1-1 draw in the first half. In the second half, they changed their strategy and had smooth sailing, overwhelming the rising Guanghua team with a score of 6-1. In total, You You triumphed with a score of 7-2.</p>
<p>Xi Qiaosheng Opens the Scoring: At 3 PM sharp, referee Chen Jixiang blew the whistle, and both sides lined up to compete. After the start, You You took the offensive first. Xi Qiaosheng dribbled straight in, Xu Jingcheng intercepted the ball and passed it to the front lines. Hu Youcheng cleverly intercepted the ball halfway, advancing forcefully into Guanghua territory. The ball lingered in front of the goal, but Hu Youcheng, Xi Qiaosheng, and Liu Shizan all missed their shots, which was a pity. Zhong Yongsen invaded from the flank, taking big strides and breaking through three barriers. He then pulled back and took a powerful shot, but it hit the goalpost and bounced back. Xi Qiaosheng calmly caught up and headed the ball in, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>First Half Ends in a Draw: After Guanghua's setback, the entire team gave their all, attacking from the sides, creating waves in front of You You's goal. Wang Caigao was flustered, but fortunately, no shots went in. Xiao Heitan, seeing the Guanghua team disrupting their position, waved his arms and jumped up, rushing to the front lines, recklessly. Qu Aisheng, seeing the situation was not good, rushed up to block him and accidentally collided with Xiao Heitan, causing Heitan to injure his ankle and leave the field. Guanghua took advantage of this opportunity to attack the city. Gu Dingxiang launched an attack from the border and took a long-range shot. Goalkeeper Wang Caigao reached out to save it, but Luo Douwen seized the opportunity and scored, making it a tie. Zhong Yongsen advanced alone, but Shi Cheng was careless and committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Qiaosheng took the penalty kick, but the ball flew over the goal, failing to score. After that, neither side scored, ending the first half 1-1.</p>
<p>Guanghua Team Loses Two More Goals: After the break, they changed sides and fought again. Guanghua's momentum was strong. Xu Jingcheng led the three armies, pressing forward together. Unfortunately, their shooting accuracy was off, turning into wild shots. Seeing the opponent's rampant offense, Qiaosheng didn't dare to linger with the ball and passed it straight to the center. Zhong Shen passed it back and forth, and with long and short passes, they advanced to Guanghua's territory. Xiao Zhong passed again, and he scored again. At this time, Guanghua's main player, Luo Douwen, was injured and left the field, making their situation even more isolated. Qiaosheng took the opportunity to enter, assisted by Shen Boxian, sneaking into Guanghua's territory and scoring again with a long-range shot.</p>
<p>7-2, Guanghua Suffers a Crushing Defeat: Guanghua's wounded soldiers were temporarily   without   , and   dangerous situations arose. Eventually, Xiao Zhong gained an advantage with Shizan's assistance, heading the ball in. Xiao Zhong added the finishing touch, making it a pair. Shen Shiqi was envious, unwilling to fall behind, and scored a goal. This angered Guanghua's main player, Xu Jingcheng, who, seeing their territory being ravaged by You You with almost no defense, took charge in the center, commanding the three armies, and their momentum was indeed revitalized. Xu then broke through three barriers, unstoppable. Wang Caigao was unable to save it, and watched as the ball rolled into the net. Time was up, and the gong was sounded to end the match. You You won a major victory over Guanghua with a score of 7-2. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>The Catholic Church schools in this city held a sports tournament. The Group A basketball and table tennis matches took place the day before yesterday, both between Zhong Fa and St. Francis. After intense battles, Zhong Fa won the table tennis match against St. Francis with a score of 5-2, winning the championship. In basketball, Zhong Fa defeated St. Francis again with a score of 55-34. Details of each are recorded below.</p>
<p>Table Tennis: The most eye-catching table tennis match for the audience began at 2 PM the day before yesterday, with several hundred spectators. The first set was Chen Binggui of St. Francis against Qian Yuran of Zhong Fa. Chen's defense was unmatched, winning the first set 3-0. In the second set, Pu Jingming of Zhong Fa continued the momentum. In the third set, St. Francis defeated Zhong Fa again. In the fourth set, Weng Mingqi refused to be outdone, using his superb counter-attack skills and clever corner shots to prevent his opponent from making a comeback, easily winning a set. In the first set, Sun Lishi used wonderful topspin smashes to render St. Francis helpless, winning with a score of 3-0. Finally, Cheng Changhan and Zheng Zhenhua of Zhong Fa used their wonderful long-range topspin and short-range pressure skills, both overcoming their opponents with a score of 3-0. The performance in this match was wonderful and won a lot of applause from around. In the end, Zhong Fa won the table tennis championship with a score of 5-2. The results are as follows:</p>

<p>Zheng Zhenhua Ying Zhongchun 3 vs 0</p>
<p>Basketball: Also, the Zhong Fa vs. St. Francis match. The difference between the strong and the weak was obviously discernible. Zhong Fa was a battle-hardened veteran team, well-coordinated and accurate in shooting. Their basketball skills had reached a high level, entering the enemy's camp as if entering an uninhabited area. However, in terms of individual strength, St. Francis had Zhang and Ge, who scored repeatedly. However, the team lacked overall coordination. In the first half, Zhong Fa took the lead with a score of 34-18. After the break, St. Francis, having already suffered a defeat, were cautious, all being careful, in order to win the final victory, but their luck was not good. Although they tried hard to recover, time was not on their side. In the end, they lowered their heads and surrendered with a score of 34-55. The referee was Shen Yuguang.</p>

<p>The Zhong Qing Standard Volleyball League began last Saturday. The Group A match between Guang Yi and Jinan A, originally scheduled, was postponed due to circumstances and was made up last night at 7 PM at the Zhong Qing Ball Room. The referee was Liang Zhao'an. As a result, Guang Yi won three to one. Guang Yi is an emerging powerhouse in this newspaper, with strong strength. Wei Dingyi, Mai Bingyao, Huang Yufu, and others are all the best of the moment. Last night, they showed their skills for the first time and reported victory. Afterwards, smooth sailing, there is still a fierce battle with last year's champion, Jiangwan team. In yesterday's battle, Guang Yi's communication was not yet pure due to their recent organization, while Jinan's back row was too weak. The competition was still fierce.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Tentative Explanation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Turen</p>
<p>Shakespeare's most famous comedy "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is currently being shown in Shanghai, which is a cause for celebration. As the translator of the original play, having left the Cathay Theater, it is my duty to offer an explanation of the real feelings I obtained from wandering through the dream of the English poetic saint of over three hundred years ago.</p>
<p>How does the poet create his dream? Look at this:</p>
<p>"The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</p>
<p>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</p>
<p>And as imagination bodies forth</p>
<p>The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen</p>
<p>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</p>
<p>A local habitation and a name."</p>
<p>—Act V, Scene 1</p>
<p>After reading this great poet's confession about the method of creation, it is easy to know that there is a reason why this "A Midsummer Night's Dream," which is interwoven by three main threads, is so moving. The poet does not build his dream in the air; he has his bricks and tiles. Plutarch's "Life of Theseus," Ovid's "Metamorphoses" (Book IV, about the legend of Thisbe and Pyramus), and the legends about little fairies circulating in the poet's hometown of Warwick are all the bricks and tiles the poet used when creating his dream. Is this plagiarism? Absolutely not! The poet is "turning them to shapes." The humble poet even uses the closing remarks of the original play to express his creative attitude:</p>
<p>"If we shadows have offended,</p>
<p>Think but this, and all is mended,</p>
<p>That you have but slumber'd here</p>
<p>While these visions did appear.</p>
<p>And this weak and idle theme,</p>
<p>No more yielding but a dream,</p>
<p>Gentles, do not reprehend:</p>
<p>If you pardon, we will mend:</p>
<p>And, as I am an honest Puck,</p>
<p>If we have unearned luck</p>
<p>Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,</p>
<p>We will make amends ere long;</p>
<p>Else the Puck a liar call.</p>
<p>So, good night unto you all.</p>
<p>Give me your hands, if we be friends,</p>
<p>And Robin shall restore amends."</p>
<p>The concrete method of creation and the very honest creative attitude used by the poet in this "A Midsummer Night's Dream" are both worth learning from.</p>
<p>What exactly did the poet dream in this "A Midsummer Night's Dream"? The dream is built in Athens, and the era is the mythological era of ancient Greece: The poet's dream must not be a dream of reality. This kind of argument is ridiculous. Shakespeare, who is revered as a realist poet, even in this "A Midsummer Night's Dream," dreams of the most realistic things. Even the Poet Laureate John Masefield, when commenting on "A Midsummer Night's Dream," had to admit that "Shakespeare grasped all the power of the English spirit. He made a large picture of English characters." The Duke of Athens portrayed by Shakespeare is the epitome of the 17th-century English aristocracy; the Athenian craftsmen are the epitome of the 17th-century English rural laborers; and the mischievous little fairies are also the realistic characters in the minds of the English country folk. Although "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is draped in Athenian clothes, the flesh inside the clothes is completely English. This is the reason why Shakespeare is revered as a realist poet.</p>
<p>Who will the poet present this "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to? Regardless of the year it was written, this "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was written to celebrate a wedding—or for a private performance in a wealthy family, or perhaps for a performance in the court. Although this cannot be determined, this play must have been presented at a court wedding. However, to conclude that Shakespeare was a despicable court poet, "a parasite, living on the generosity of his feudal superiors with an unashamed face," is also a mechanical assertion. In "A Midsummer Night's Dream," which is based on the Athenian craftsmen pleasing the Athenian monarchs, the poet is explaining his progressive worldview to his audience. The Athenian craftsmen's crude, simple, and sincere nature, without any malice, combines with the more poetic mood of the upper class like brothers, so that the audience will naturally feel a kind of attraction that treats all mankind equally. The simplicity of the lower class and the open-mindedness of the upper class are smoothly blended into one.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Disguised Appearance and Convenient Transformation <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for readers to be moved, when writing novels, people often describe other people's stories as if they had experienced them themselves; because readers generally have a considerable understanding and belief in the author, they are more likely to sympathize when told that it is the author's own story; moreover, in "autobiographical" form, the tone is often direct, making it easier to understand.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, one's own story is written as someone else's, because there are things that conflict with laws and morals, and if they were stated directly, they would not be tolerated by public opinion; or it may be necessary to keep secrets and not disclose them publicly. Only by being in the position of a third party and writing in "biographical" form (or third-person form) can one express oneself freely and happily.</p>
<p>Changing things like this is a means of "convenient transformation"; although the form is changed, "authenticity" can still be maintained. An autobiography is different from a "self-narrative"; a self-narrative can also be written in biographical form. In literature, convenient transformation is a common technique, and those who know it can see it at a glance.</p>
<p>In literary works, there are even more drastic changes in things; according to the theory that "literature is a symbol of depression," this is "disguised appearance."</p>
<p>There are probably two reasons for disguised appearance: first, because it is not possible to express directly, one has to make use of the topic; for example, one secretly falls in love with a member of the opposite sex, admiring them very urgently, but is hindered by ethical customs, and it is not possible to be together in reality; "reason" dares not think about it anymore, but "emotion" refuses to give up, and still deeply regrets, forming a "ball of depression," wanting to move at all times, and taking any opportunity to erase its original form, entrusting it to relevant facts to vent.</p>
<p>Second, one has deep depression, but it is somewhat inexplicable, because it is fundamental, unfamiliar, and also abstract; to vent, one has to find concrete facts to express it; like being bitten by a poisonous snake in a dream, or being beaten by someone, and still feeling pain after waking up, and even developing sores at the wound and producing pus. The place where the sores develop was already poisoned and had hidden pain, but it was not felt during the busy day; the "subconscious" felt it, so it took the opportunity to borrow the existing concepts of snake bites and beatings as a concrete report; this kind of disguised appearance is very common in literature.</p>
<p>Whether it is convenient transformation or disguised appearance, the result is a kind of "symbolism"; although the head and face are changed, it is still an analogy and representation of the original body. Convenient transformation and disguised appearance have similar functions, but they are fundamentally different: convenient transformation is due to the author's intention and is a kind of "technique"; disguised appearance is due to the unconscious and is something that cannot be sought. Probably, the result of convenient transformation is only "broad symbolism"; the result of disguised appearance is "narrow symbolism," which is what is called true symbolism in literature.</p>
<p>In "pure literature," narrow symbolism holds a higher position; however, "the literature of life" is more objective and emphasizes reason, so it is more important to use convenient transformation, because this can be done by force, while disguised appearance is difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>Although it cannot be sought, disguised appearance is one of the essential qualities of literature. The literature of life focuses on exploring problems, but it must use the essential qualities of literature to easily move the reader; otherwise, it is only theory and does not count as literature. The so-called cannot be sought does not mean that it is absolutely impossible to do, but that it comes slowly. Authors of the literature of life, to make use of disguised appearance, must first have proper theory as a prerequisite and temper their personality, then the result of disguised appearance will have a great atmosphere;—aiming at great undertakings at all times, the things borrowed by disguised appearance will naturally also be great. Otherwise, leaving it to nature, emotion is originally blind, and the result of "unconscious suggestion" is inevitably just "flowers" and "moons." Although the "flowers" and "moons" in general literary works are sometimes also due to disguised appearance, what do they mean?</p>
<h3 id="e161">Invoking the Gods <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>It was a beautiful summer morning in 1928. Hei Gu Li Ju, who specialized in the human trafficking business, ran from Furongwei, a neighboring village, to Changba. He walked along the narrow paths, sometimes climbing up hills, sometimes hiding at the foot of mountains, as if he were a small boat gliding on waves.</p>
<p>At this time, Changba had just gone through "village cleansing" – a kind of open robbery and massacre. The residents had only returned from outside the village two days before to tidy up their furniture and bury the dead. Charred woodenware and clothes were discarded everywhere. A pungent, fishy stench permeated the ravaged hills and the burned and chopped forests. White smoke from still unextinguished fires rose from the distant and nearby slopes. Besides the waste and garbage, piles of dried or fresh tree bark lay everywhere. Whenever Hei Gu Li Ju passed such a place, he paid attention to whether there were any exposed corpses and pinched his nose with his fingers. In this "village cleansing," the village head Xu Dacheng was killed. … The residents had nothing to eat, so they gathered wild rattan vegetables and field herbs, mixed them with bitter lotus seeds and wild asparagus, and burned them to eat. As a result, all the villagers suffered from severe diarrhea.</p>
<p>On the eastward-facing hillside beside the Ke family, Ke Di was kneeling next to the earthen wall, invoking the gods.</p>
<p>"Great Emperor Ziwei, you know everything, but I'll say it anyway, the same as last night and this morning: give us something to eat! Great Emperor Ziwei, you know everything…"</p>
<p>She prayed devoutly in a low voice, repeating herself. She was very thin and wore ragged, all-black coarse cloth clothes. Her braid coiled on her back like a small snake, and her whole body was huddled together. The earthen wall, almost collapsing, stood precariously beside her, threatening to fall and bury her completely at any moment. At that time, she was only twelve years old.</p>
<p>Hei Gu Li Ju and her father, Ke Laosi, were arguing fiercely in front of the sickbed. Because he was asking for too high a price, Li Ju mocked him. Ke Di had never seen her father so angry or so insulted before. Her mother sat on a hoe, wailing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"Ke Laosi, you're completely ignorant of the market price! Children are given away at times like these! If someone wants her, you should know that the child will live a few days longer than with you, and maybe even grow up. You should be thanking people. If you're dreaming, let me wake you up: good children are worth ten dollars per year of age, five dollars per year of age! Just keep yelling!"</p>
<p>"A child can only be sold once, you idiot!" Ke Laosi scolded him. "I'm selling a person now. Once she leaves the door, she'll never come back."</p>
<p>"Anyone who comes to me, Li Ju, is selling people… If they leave the door and keep coming back, that's called dealing with the in-laws! I've never been a matchmaker."</p>
<p>"Have a conscience, you dead dog! A human heart is made of flesh."</p>
<p>"Then I'm sorry…"</p>
<p>"Don't go!"</p>
<p>Ke Laosi loudly stopped him, and then said to him:</p>
<p>"Okay, you know very well that I have no choice but to sell! Now you can say whatever you want, but after I get better, be careful that my axe doesn't chop your neck!…"</p>
<p>"Then what about me? Am I supposed to chop up your corpse with my axe?"</p>
<p>Ke Di, frightened, quietly slipped out the door. In front of the chicken coop, she knelt down again and continued her prayer.</p>
<p>"Great Emperor Ziwei, you know everything…"</p>
<p>It was very quiet in the mountains. The sparse sounds of axes chopping trees and the heavy echoes of piles being driven into the hard earth did not disturb anything. Sunlight flooded the uneven and hazy village like golden lake water. When the Ke family was at its most prosperous, they had raised four mottled chicks in the chicken coop. Now, only a few short bamboo branches stuck diagonally in the black soil remained there.</p>
<p>Ke Di temporarily stopped her prayer and, together with Hei Gu Li Ju, left her chicken coop forever and ran to the world beyond the mountains.</p>

<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Five or six years ago – my hometown was originally a poor village; but, thank God! Everyone still managed to live in an atmosphere of peace: putting down their hoes, people could still afford half a tael of liquor, and every year there were still one or two joyous god-welcoming festivals; young people never forgot to sing folk songs, and old men loved to have a hint of a smile on their faces.</p>
<p>Just last year or the year before – although the drought brought starvation and freezing, and war brought sighs and tears, the present sorrow had already chased away the past joy; but it was still considered a human world: you could still hear dogs barking, and you could still hear chickens crowing.</p>
<p>But this year – the Yellow River's turbid waves are just like a gluttonous poisonous dragon! It swallowed our thatched huts, swallowed our fields, and even swallowed our livestock and children…</p>
<p>At this moment, the water has finally receded, but our home is just a wasteland! In the wasteland – there are only a few skinny dogs that weren't drowned, searching everywhere for their old homes; countless crows are fighting over carrion, cawing in the setting sun…</p>
<h3 id="e163">Passing Through the Strait of Malacca <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>I borrowed a sampan from a friend, and a familiar companion took me out to sea. Leaving Zhongjie, passing "Lao Ba Sai," the sea came into view. Months of noise and a gray and melancholy life were about to come to an end. When the sampan approached the "Jida" steamer, the companion said:</p>
<p>"Come back from Penang soon! Zhongjie has lively cafes."</p>
<p>I nodded and smiled, wondering when I would return to Singapore. If there's food to eat and work to do, everywhere is home! Otherwise, I will come back to Zhongjie. Zhongjie has my friends, Zhongjie's exit has the sea, Zhongjie's coffee shops have all kinds of people, and Zhongjie has food!</p>
<p>The ship set sail under the blazing sun. It rounded a corner of Lion Island, leaving behind the bustling and crowded docks and warehouses. The flag of Penang Hill looked small, and the road disappeared at the corner of the island. Red sand was exposed in the small hills on the shore, and the bare hills did not have black stones. The ship slowly passed between two low, small red hills, and the waves hit the coast of Lion Island in the distance.</p>
<p>On the ship, I ran into a shipmate who was a relative. He said:</p>
<p>"Penang isn't better than Singapore. There are unemployed people everywhere; miners from Ipoh and Perak leave the country from here all the time. This 'garden of the South' is desolate now."</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Even if the flower is withered, one must still take a look. Perhaps there are still flowers of hope in the withered flower clusters."</p>
<p>The next day, we passed through the Strait of Malacca. The wind was calm and the waves were gentle in this narrow strait, and the ripples in the sea were like the wind blowing across a pond. Occasionally there were seagulls, and occasionally there were sailboats. Besides that, the sea reflected golden light under the intense sun, and the fishing boats of the fishermen were invisible in the distance.</p>
<p>At about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a fishing boat passing through the lonely sea. It was lonely, with its sails fully raised, and the hull was blackened by tar. In the bow, it looked like a leaf in the distance, and then, in the original appearance of a sailboat, it floated lonely past the stern.</p>
<p>My relative, who was a clerk on the ship, told me:</p>
<p>"This must be a fugitive, habitually crossing the waves between Malaya and Sumatra. Fishermen's boats can't travel so far, and they don't go as leisurely as a lame immortal crossing the sea! Look at how the boat sways! It looks just like a lame duck."</p>
<p>I didn't say anything. I wondered why there were no sea roars or raging waves in the Strait of Malacca. A calm and gentle sea is not the norm; I don't want to see a calm ocean!</p>
<p>In the evening, the ship arrived at Penang between rows of beautiful mountains. Years of longing had been fulfilled, and after seeing the lush tropical green mountains, the Strait of Malacca was lightly let go.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Miscellaneous Memories of Fleeing (Continued) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Perhaps they were packing things for the escape at home? In short, I didn't succeed in peeking. My mother and aunts were, of course, extremely disheartened. But I was overjoyed. I first ate a lot of peanuts that were lying on the ground unattended, and when I came back, my two small pockets were almost bursting.</p>
<p>During these three or four days of fleeing, the adults must have had a real scare, right? That was when they saw a dozen or twenty fellows with sheep horns, red-tasseled spears, and broadswords passing outside the door. Everyone immediately hid in the latrine, and told me not to stick my head out from the straw to look around. After a while, they heard that those people were going to help the Tongzhi Society, and they immediately laughed and scolded as they crawled out. At that time, I thought, isn't this as fun as the hide-and-seek game we kids play?</p>
<p>Later, when we went back, whenever I remembered these interesting things, I would always tug at my mother's sleeve and ask...</p>
<p>"Mom, when? When will we have to flee again?"</p>
<p>My mother, who understood the suffering of fleeing, puffed out her cheeks and scolded:</p>
<p>"What, you're asking for bad luck! ...Don't ask about such things!"</p>
<p>Later, I also fled many times outside, but the situation was like eating Western pills. The sugar coating on the outside had already melted away, and all that was left was the bitter and spicy taste.</p>
<h3 id="e165">New Residence <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>It has been less than a month since I moved into this new residence, and already friends have been advising me to move. But I always watch as car after car drives up to other people's doors for their moves, while I delay day after day. My friends' intentions are appreciated. However, how could they know that I have other ideas?</p>
<p>I do not love this new residence. The so-called new residence is only two cramped floors, barely enough to hold my knees, and there are absolutely no conditions that ordinary people would find desirable. However, if I really had to move away, I could not help but feel some reluctance.</p>
<p>This new residence is on East Sports Association Road, near the shooting range. But when I first moved in, I didn't know that. After I had settled down a bit and was sitting by the window reading a book, a series of "pipi-papai" sounds frightened me. I turned around and looked out the window, and then I discovered that the sound was coming from a dark green earthen hill. On the earthen hill was a row of ochre-colored walls, and under the walls were a few black wooden plaques with white characters! Arabic numerals! and the pieces of white paper that were pasted on the plaques rose and fell with the sound of the gunshots from time to time. All of this was vividly displayed before my eyes. Only then did I suddenly realize that I was actually living at the foot of the shooting range.</p>
<p>Who wouldn't shudder! Perhaps everyone would think that as a people of the colony, I should be afraid of being treated as a ochre-colored wall, a black wooden plaque, or a piece of white paper on this dark green earthen hill! However, I immediately felt that this new residence was suitable for me. Living as a person of the twentieth century, how can one not be accustomed to hearing this most inspiring and greatest of music! The sound of shooting at this range is truly otherworldly, the most arrogant and wonderful music that cannot be found anywhere else in the world!</p>
<p>There was also a time when I listened quietly to the music inside modern Western-style buildings. This situation was exactly as the Japanese writer Kazuo Uchimura wrote in his novel Leprosy!</p>
<p>"His room, number 65 on the second floor, was located slightly towards the center of the long corridor... All the sounds that arose in this corner of the building seemed to naturally converge towards the center. Although the interior was completely divided, in one corner of this large box-like building, any sound would cause a faint echo in the four walls. The echo flowed towards the center and gradually faded away. - The sound of men's straw sandals passing through the corridor; the quiet voices of two or three people secretly avoiding prying eyes; the grinding sound of transport carts; the sound of meal boxes being thrown down three times a day; the heavy footsteps of the guards and the clanging of their swords. - …These mixed sounds, once they flowed here, became a kind of harmonious melody. This is a world where people are strictly forbidden to speak to their companions, and from morning to night, one can only see gray walls and the blue sky through iron-barred windows, but even in this, there is still a naturally brewing world of music, bringing such a complex timbre…"</p>
<p>This state of mind is probably shared by modern young people who have quietly spent some time in Western-style buildings! However, this is the most wonderful music of modern times, with a quiet timbre. Compared to the music I hear in my ears at this moment, it is quite the "opposite".</p>
<p>Those sounds initially came in sparse clusters. The tone was short and well-rounded. It was as if a group of wild children, in a forest where the leaves were yellow and falling, had picked up some chestnuts and thrown them into the fire, causing "pong" or "peng" explosions, followed by "whala!" consonants. I felt a kind of valley tranquility. Afterwards, the sound was continuous. It was like accumulated snow pressing on bamboo, a strong wind shaking violently, and the bamboo stems bursting, "pong la! Pong la! Pong la!" A series of sounds reverberated through the clouds. I felt the sounds of the white snow and the sense of the song being too high for many to appreciate. Then, perhaps, there would be silence, and the sigh of the wind would flow through the still air. Perhaps there would be an even more激厉, clearer, and more passionate sound, like celebrating the New Year, the sound of firecrackers like a happy and peaceful atmosphere. And this is the voices of people around, the sound of wheels, the cries of vendors, the sound of horses' hooves, the cries of children, the whistle of trains, the rustling of grass tips, the rustling of fallen leaves, and the orderly footsteps of foreign soldiers on the cinder road! All of this is suppressed low, fragile and dim, desolate and bleak, but it becomes the only consonant of this great and powerful ensemble. Therefore, if the former music is said to have a quiet timbre, then this music can be said to have a dynamic timbre. The former music is often loved by pale-faced people close to death; while this music is loved by young people who are full of energy and should be restrained from fighting. Listening to the former music can make people fall into a deep sleep, gradually becoming silent and entering the state of Nirvana. But listening to this music will inevitably make people's blood splash, wanting to dye the whole world red! I have to be in this new residence, listening to this most great and wonderful music in the world, which deeply makes me reflect on the destiny of mankind from time to time. I truly want to thank this ancient land with tears streaming down my face, and how can I bear to move away from it even for a moment!</p>
<p>Secondly, according to my lifestyle habits, I always move my body a little every morning when I wake up. After arriving here, I walk along East Sports Association Road. The next morning, I strolled to a large bridge. Oh! Under the veil-like morning mist, what a beautiful and quiet residence there was! It was surrounded by bamboo fences, and the bamboo fences were covered with lush green vines. In the middle were four or five barracks-style plank houses. The millet-colored planks were all hidden among the verdant and luxuriant branches and leaves of vines, willows, and peach trees, like the secluded scene in Du Fu's poem "Beautiful Woman" where she "leads vines to mend the thatched hut". Outside the bamboo fence, the fields were divided into small plots, planted with vegetables, chrysanthemums, peach trees, willows, and the like, sparsely and densely, left to nature as if no human labor had been added. In the middle was a round patch of ground paved with broken tiles, surrounded by saplings of cypresses as thick as an arm. At this time, the sun had not yet risen, but the desolate mist was gradually receding. The crowing of chickens in the small house, and the barking of dogs in the neighboring house, proudly sang together, creating a scene where even chickens and dogs could become immortals. After a while, a Chinese compatriot, wearing short clothes and barefoot, carried a square wooden table out of the small house and placed it on the altar made of broken tiles. He stood there in a daze for a while, then turned around and went back in, and carried out two brown rattan chairs. Each chair had a brown soft cushion. He arranged the rattan chairs opposite each other. He diligently wiped them for a while, and then stood there in a daze again before slowly walking in. His actions were full of the leisurely and idyllic charm of the medieval pastoral era, which was perfectly matched with this lazy and slow melody. After he went in, a man in a Western suit came out wearing slippers. After walking a short distance, he used his left hand to cover his forehead and looked up at the sky. The sky was full of white clouds! Then he raised the newspaper in his right hand and looked at it. Slowly and methodically, he walked to the earthen altar and plopped down on the rattan chair, slowly yawning, put the newspaper on the table, stretched his fists a few times, yawned again, and then sat down and leaned on the table to read the newspaper. When the sun spat out a touch of pale light, and the sound of chickens and dogs gradually became sparse, a woman in ancient costume, wearing a white apron, came out gracefully holding a delicate tea tray. She placed the teapot from the tray in front of the man, and said something softly as if, and then sat down opposite him. She poured a cup of tea for the man, and then poured a cup for herself, picked up a newspaper, and read it quietly. This middle-aged couple was quietly in the silent language of nature in the morning. - This couldn't help but make me imagine things from before the Three Dynasties. However, compared to Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring, it must be "more than equal to" it! Although the world has already advanced to the twentieth century, such a medieval pastoral flavor and leisurely sentiment is also a dog grabbing a carpet, a barbarous legacy that we, the so-called inferior nation in the world, envy!</p>
<p>The kindness of my friends who advise me to move is appreciated! But I am a person of the twentieth century, and I must develop the habit of loving to listen to the great music of the end of this century! I can't bear to give up my new residence even for a moment!</p>

<p>Sellers are Powerful Big Players: Gold Prices Unable to Rise; Although Big Players Take Advantage to Buy Low, Supply Remains Abundant at High Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market faced difficulties and suffered a terrible fall. The big players, acting as sellers, took advantage of the high prices to exert pressure. The foreign exchange market was stable due to the adjustments made by the three major banks, preventing any rise in prices. The long positions were extremely crowded, and after the rise, prices began to decline. In the morning, the overseas silver market reported that the large forward contracts remained unchanged, with only the spot price falling by 1.25 pence. It was said that the sellers had limited their quantities, and the United States was willing to enter the market, with many believing that they only purchased 7.5% of the sellers' volume. After the market closed, all sellers were present, but there were no buyers. The New York silver market contracted by one cent, and the Montreal forward silver price plummeted by 2.5 to 5 cents. Exchange rates uniformly declined, partly due to misunderstandings in the market. The Central Bank's posted rates were stable for both British and American currencies, with the customs gold unit rising by 4%. The calibrated gold price was posted at $1148.30, and preliminary trading opened at $54. Big players such as Chunyuan, Yongfu, and Fengyong all sold, pushing the price down to $53. The market opened high in the morning, but selling interest from big players was significant after the opening, shifting from firm to flat. Reuters reported that New York expected the Treasury Department to buy silver at low prices, and there were also rumors that China would reinstate silver dollars as currency. Market sentiment gradually stabilized, and prices gradually declined. Although there was a rebound in the middle, pressure from Jiaotong, Zhejiang, and China ultimately pushed the price below $50. The silver equalization tax was announced, shrinking by 6.75%, and the Central Bank also intervened, causing a temporary drop. However, because the foreign exchange market remained stable, the Indian silver forecast to fall by 20 annas could still be pulled up, but market sentiment was difficult to revive. Selling pressure increased due to the pressure from big players, and the market became even weaker at noon. In the afternoon session, the big players took advantage of the low prices to buy back in due to the tightness in the Hong Kong market, turning from flat to up. However, supply remained abundant at high prices, making it easy to add to the decline. The initial Indian silver report indicated a contraction of 28 annas, and the situation remained stable. Thereafter, demand and supply became mediocre, and market conditions became more stable. After the second Indian silver report, the price once fell to $46.80, but was soon pulled back up, and short positions were covered. The final market was stable, with a total of over 12,000 lots. Long positions still exceeded short positions by 23. Here is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $1153, up $1.20 from the previous close, and then rose to $3.80. Chunyuan and Yongfu sold off, dropping to $2.70. Dafa and Yongda advanced to $3.60.

Fuxing and Yong still sold to $0.6. Hengyu and Richang advanced to $2.20. Fuxing, Yong, and Yongli sold again to $1.30. Qianyuan, Yongda, and Decheng still advanced to over $2. HSBC Bank's posted rates remained unchanged, and market sentiment was still stable. Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng came out and then advanced, gradually rising from $1.50. Yuanchang, Yongheng, Changyong, Hengyu, Hongkang, Yongyuan, and Maoyong all advanced, rising to $3.30. Fuxing and Yong sold continuously. Futaiheng, Chunyuan, Yongrichang, Yingxiang, Hengyu, Tongtaichang, and others sold heavily. Reuters reported that New York expects China to reinstate silver dollars as currency, and the price fell to $0.2. Dadecheng and Yifengyong still advanced to $1.30. Fuxing, Yongqianchang, and Xiang sold heavily, breaking the $50 level and falling to $49.20. Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yonghui, Xiang, Jinsheng, Yongqian, and Yong Shenfeng took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, rising to $50.60. Fuxing and Yonghui sold again to $49.50. At this time, Jin Fengyong, Qian Yuanyong, and Shenfeng were still buying, so the price rose to $50.20. Hengchangyong, Yuanyi, Yuanshengyong, and Fuxingyong still sold. The silver equalization tax was announced, shrinking by 6.75%, and the price fell to $48.60. Dadecheng and Chunyuan Yong came to buy back, rising back to $50. Jiaotong and China dumped foreign exchange again. Hengchang, Yongda, Fuxing, Yongfuyu, Dadecheng, and Xianghe sold heavily, falling to $47.60. Fuxing and Yongfuyu took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, which allowed them to maintain. Han Hengyiyu and Hengyu sold heavily at high prices, and long positions showed signs of collapse. The afternoon closing price fell to $1147.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at $1146.90. Fuxing, Yonglifeng, and Hengyu immediately advanced and rose to $7.90. Chunyuan Yongda and Decheng Zhentai sold off, retreating to $7.30. Fuxing, Yongdeli, Yongli, Hengyu, and Huixiang continued to advance, rising back to $8.70. Qingfa Yongda and Decheng Fuxiang took advantage of the high prices to sell off gradually, retreating to $7.20. The initial Indian silver report indicated a fall of 28.27.27 annas. Qingfa and Yongfuxing still advanced to $8. Dadecheng and Yuantai sold off, and the price fell again to $7.20. The Hong Kong market reported a shortage of supply, and Huixiang and Yongdada advanced again to $8. However, because Chunyuan Yongfuxingyong saw high prices and sold slightly, the market turned flat and stable. The second Indian silver report remained unchanged, and the situation hovered. Later, Fuxingyong and Chunyuan Yong and many bulls still sold, and the price fell to $6.80. Dada Huixiang, Yifengyong, Hengyu, Tongtaichang, Fengchang, Wanfeng, Yuanyong, and others successively purchased, rising to $9. Qianyuan Yongfuxingyong took advantage of the high prices to still sell, retreating to $8.30. The closing price was $1148.40, and the market was flat after the close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, was posted at $1148.30. In terms of the closing price, it was not much different from the standard gold price, which was more than $5 lower than the previous close. The registration price for this month was $1138, and for January it was $1147. The morning replenishment price was $1138, and the afternoon replenishment price was $1139. The pure gold price was still the same as the forward contract price, at $1153. The spot market was stable, and Tianjin goods and coarse gold were both marked up by $6.50 over the standard gold price, but no transactions were made. Yesterday, Dingtai Heng posted 14 lots to Fuxingyong at $8.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was mediocre. In summary, Fuxing, Yonghui, Xiangxianghe, Yuanshengyong, Fengchang, Futaiheng, Chunyuan Yong Shentai, Dingtai Qianchang Xiang Tongtaichang, and others were on the selling side. Yifengyong, Qingfa, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Yongli Renfa, Yongrichang Wanxing, Zhentai Dada Wanfeng Dadecheng Hengyu, and others were on the buying side. Qian Yuanyong advanced first and then exited. Fukang exited first and then advanced. The Dalian gang Wanxing advanced more than 200 lots, but only exited less than 100 when profitable. The Guang gang Shengda Hengxing remained inactive.</p>
<p>Checking the market conditions for the day, the market was initially firm and then weak. The morning opening was $1153, and the afternoon closing was $1148.40. The highest price was $1153.80 in the morning session, and the lowest price was $1146.80 in the afternoon session, with a fluctuation of $7.

<h3 id="e168">Silver Prices Continue to Plunge; Foreign Exchange Market Receives Adjustments from Three Banks, Japanese Banks' Intentions Remain Strong; Large Transactions on Both Sides <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign news reports yesterday, London's large forward contracts remained unopened, with only the spot price falling by 1.25 pence. It was said that the sellers had limited their quantities, and the United States was willing to purchase, with many believing they purchased about 7.5% of the sellers' supply. After the market closed, there was a lack of buyers, and most were selling. The New York silver market contracted by one cent, and the Montreal forward silver price fell by 2.5 to 5 cents. London's spot gold rose by 2.5 pence, the British pound against the US dollar contracted by 0.0625, the British pound against the French franc fell by 0.13 pounds, the US dollar against the British pound contracted by 0.0375, and the US dollar against the French franc rose by 0.0625. Market sentiment was stable. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling, 2 and 0.0375 pence, and the US exchange at $29.50, which was flat for British exchange and tight for US exchange by 0.00625 compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's posted rates were stable for both British and American currencies, and the customs gold unit rose by 4%. The situation remained soft after the opening. Meifu Petroleum Company and Jincheng still bid, but with Shanghai Jiaotong taking advantage of the winter season to sell, it was still able to support the market. HSBC Bank's posted rates were stable for both British and American currencies, gradually stabilizing the market. Reuters reported that New York now expects the Treasury Department to not change its silver purchasing policy, or to only slightly purchase at low prices. There were also rumors that China would reinstate silver dollars as currency, and market sentiment gradually stabilized. China and Zhejiang came to sell, and the silver equalization tax was announced, falling by 6.75%, causing market sentiment to turn weak. China also sold and slightly emptied out. However, banks were actively trading with each other, and the Indian silver forecast to fall by 22 annas was still able to be maintained. The Chinese merchants' psychology was already numb, and they took advantage of the trend to be listless at noon. In the afternoon session, due to the tension in the Hong Kong market, the banks' appetite remained flat, and it was difficult to see any changes. This was because there were people adjusting the market when prices were high. The initial Indian silver report indicated a fall of 28 annas, which also lacked much impact. Reuters reported that the Hong Kong market remained soft, and the second Indian silver report remained unchanged. At this time, the process hovered, and the trend struggled significantly. Although Japanese banks came to aggressively bid, the Central Bank's strong trend of adjustment ultimately made it difficult to tighten the market again. The closing selling price for the near-term British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 and 0.0375 pence, and the US exchange was $29.50, which was flat for British exchange and tight for US exchange by 0.00625 compared to the previous close. The Chinese merchants' sales were not large, and there was a lack of out-bidding. Japanese banks and others had strong buying intentions, but with the efforts of the three major Chinese banks to sell, there were large transactions on both sides. Here is a record of the day's transaction prices:</p>
<p>The morning opening selling price for the near-term British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 and 0.0375 pence. Shanghai Jiaotong sold to Jincheng for December at 0.0375.

<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to the North China Incident, one wave after another, the market sentiment was still weak. The financial sector had some selling, but trading was not high, with swap transactions being more active. The trend was still an inability to rally, and the current spinning situation was still a transitional phase. Yesterday, four sessions were held. In the morning, both sessions for the current month's demobilization were completely inactive. The number 43 bonds after the 1943 series had quite a lot of selling, and the numbers 35 and 78 also had selling, while numbers 32 and 43 had buying. The market price decreased by 0.012 to 0.045. In the second session, only numbers 20 and 71 had some action. Numbers 4, 14, North Series, and 43 all had selling, and the market atmosphere was very tired. The consolidated tax for this month was slightly loose by 0.006, and the rest were also small by 0.003 to 0.005. In the afternoon opening, numbers 4, 32, 顪 number, and 48 had buying, and numbers 35, 78, and 79 had selling. The former continued to decrease by 0.003 to 0.004, starting with the consolidated tax, retail investors had some short covering, and the market price gradually rose upwards. Also, with the consolidated tax, the previous two sessions fell by one yuan, so the market sentiment was slightly firm. The latter numbers all saw a rebound of 0.002 to 0.003, but Number 6 still could not rally. At the close, the forward demobilization bonds rebounded by 0.004 due to swap relations, while the rest saw highs and lows, and were stable.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reports that yesterday (11th), the New York stock market advanced under the leadership of automobile and steel stocks due to the silver situation turning loose. Railway stocks were more stable than before, and public utility stocks rose slightly. The small exchange market saw mixed movements in monthly stocks, and the bond market was calm. The total volume of transactions for the whole day was 2.13 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market is plummeting, and the falling trend is particularly tragic. This is because overseas silver is falling sharply, and the three grades of American cotton yarn are uniformly declining. As a result, the market sentiment is panic-stricken, and the bulls, seeing the unfavorable environment, painfully close out their positions. The market price is falling wildly. However, the massive amounts of money in the financial sector have not yet been released. It is difficult to predict what the future holds. However, the falling trend is also too violent.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Fall by Three to Four Yuan</p>
<p>The bidding yarn market opened in the morning. Bidding opened for each month, and the market was still optimistic, carrying on the previous day's momentum. Unexpectedly, American cotton fell, and the standard gold price remained unchanged. As a result, the reaction was even more intense, and the selling trend suddenly intensified. The market price declined step by step. Changfeng and Dajing grabbed short positions. Although the bulls in the financial sector remained calm, it was still difficult to recover a frantic situation. As a result, each month fell by 2 to 3.4 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened with each month seeing a slight rebound of a few points. Bidding was very active until the second and third sessions, because retail shorts closed out positions and brokers found it even more difficult to support. As a result, each month fell by 0.9 to 1.12 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tongfu sold 1,550 bales, Tongji 650 bales, Yuda 1,050 bales, Zhenda 550 bales, Changyu 1,150 bales, Renfeng 1,450 bales, Yichang 1,050 bales, Yongchang 1,050 bales, Xinhua 650 bales, Dachangcheng 1,550 bales, and Runkang 1,600 bales. Meiji bought 650 bales, Dashi 550 bales, Hexing 1,350 bales, Gengfeng 850 bales, Senkang 800 bales, Shenji 1,250 bales, Changfeng 2,000 bales, Mingde 650 bales, Changji 600 bales, Ruida 2,050 bales, and Yichang 1,150 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Bidding Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Rise/Fall　Account Balance</p>
<p>December　156.7　195.0　195.2　Fall 3.10　21,550</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales were clearer than yesterday. It was found that the total number of spot sales for the day was 450 bales, and the market price fell by 1.2 yuan. The purchase amount for each department is as follows: Hankou 30, Mainland 310, Wuhu 5</p>
<p>Colleague 35, Guangdong 30, Henan 40</p>
<p>The cotton market is falling, and the falling trend is remarkably strong. This is because American cotton is affected by the sharp fall in the silver market. The spot price broke the 0.12 threshold, and the market sentiment was frightened. The longs came out, and the market price fell by 1.3 yuan. However, the Tongji bulls still purchased to add to their positions. Changhe and Xincheng and others were not moved. It is still difficult to be stable about the future situation.</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Falls by One Yuan</p>
<p>The forward cotton market opened in the morning, and each month fell uniformly. The sellers flocked in, and the market price was even more difficult to support. However, Tongji and the financial bulls were adding to their positions. Xincheng and Changhe still absorbed, but it was still difficult to stop the bubble wind. In fact, the retail shorts closed out positions, and Yuda Yichang short sellers worked hard to add to their positions. The March and April futures uniformly broke the 4 yuan threshold. As a result, each month fell by 0.78 to 1.15 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon market opened flat. The price rose slightly until the second and third sessions, and the falling trend was even stronger. However, the closing price of Osaka's three grades of cotton rose by 0.003, 0.004, and 0.005 compared to the morning price. Yichang bid, and Xincheng bought again. As a result, each month fell by 0.0005 to 0.0024 compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Zhenda sold 2,000 loads, Dafu 1,200 loads, Jifeng 1,900 loads, Dafeng 4,200 loads, Yuda 4,700 loads, Shenchang 1,200 loads, Changyu 1,100 loads, Yuan Yi 1,600 loads, Yichang 1,900 loads, Hengchang 2,200 loads, Yikang 2,900 loads, Yuanxingchang 3,800 loads, Shenji 1,700 loads, and Changfeng 1,400 loads. Yuanda bought 1,700 loads, Tongji 4,300 loads, Yiyu 2,100 loads, Hexing 4,300 loads, Senkang 1,600 loads, Changfeng 2,400 loads, Shengyuan 2,500 loads, Xincheng 5,800 loads, Changhe 2,400 loads, Yichang 5,300 loads, and Yikang 2,200 loads. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 283,000</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Mediocre</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is mediocre, and factory appetite is stagnant. However, sources from each route are rare. Yao cotton arrived at 1,500 bales, and Tong cotton arrived at 1,600 bales.</p>

<h3 id="e174">American Cotton Also Declines with Silver Prices <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with fluctuating market conditions due to uncertainty in the silver market, unpredictable European political situations, and delays in the Supreme Court's rulings. Price fluctuations ranged from one to four points across different months. Subsequently, long positions were closed and then reopened, with some activity from Far Eastern buyers. However, due to falling silver prices and reduced demand from the industry, prices fell slightly. Mid-session, short covering and local buying provided some rebound. Finally, large-scale long position liquidations and heavy selling led to a weak market. As a result, spot prices fell by 30 points, and futures prices fell by 25 to 31 points. English cotton spot prices rose by two points, and futures rose by one point. The futures initially rose due to short covering, but then weakened due to long liquidations. Calculated in terms of local currency, Pungole rose by 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 1.5 rupees, and Broach rose by 1.375 rupees. Original telegram records are on the left.

<h3 id="e175">Grains: Flour Market Heavily Hit <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a further decline across all months. Opening prices in the morning were initially based on foreign wheat quotations, with Chicago down two to three cents and Canada down eight tenths to one cent. Market sentiment was unsteady due to the decline in foreign wheat and significant fluctuations in the foreign silver market. Opening prices immediately fell by one or two cents. Trading was active in subsequent sessions, with prices fluctuating. However, at the afternoon opening, the market was initially stable, but then the closure of the Xinda Flour Mill (Xingji leased the Lida factory site and operated as a single entity) caused concern. Although there was no direct relationship with the exchange, customers with hedged positions were potentially affected. In addition, the small rebound in gold prices further softened sentiment, leading to widespread abandonment of hedging, which intensified the decline in nearby months. Nearby months fell by eight or nine cents, and distant months fell by five or six cents. Looking ahead, if customers do not take delivery this month, there may be further declines.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Wheat Futures See Selling Pressure in Every Session <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was initially stable in the morning session, but sentiment was weak due to falling foreign wheat quotations. Prices for all months fell by three or four cents. In the afternoon session, the market suddenly experienced a sharp decline due to the significant implications of the silver issue, which inevitably affected the prices of various commodities. Moreover, rumors of 680 hedged positions in the flour market triggered a sharp decline. As a result, long positions became weaker, leading to selling pressure in every session and a sharp drop in prices. Although inventories are not abundant, sales are sluggish amid the current economic difficulties, which exert significant pressure on the market, resulting in a sharp decline. Both nearby and distant months fell by more than ten cents, serving as a warning to speculators. The spot wheat market is weak due to poor mill demand, and asking prices have fallen by another two or three cents. Shandong wheat is quoted at 4.80 yuan, Suzhou/Lai wheat at 4.78 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.77 yuan, and Chuzhou wheat at 4.76 yuan. It is said that Fuxin handled 3,000 bags.</p>

<p>Overseas wheat: 2 million bushels of December futures are due for delivery, leading to price easing. Due to limited legal tender, Canadian sales policies discourage aggressive buying, but many believe that prices will ultimately stabilize as a result.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of over fifty dealers arrived with supplies (over ten thousand shih of goods). Sales in this district continued to be active due to overcast weather. Tianjin and Qingdao merchants also handled over three thousand bags, leading to a slight tightening of the market. High-quality Booda rice was stable, and intermediate-quality goods were scarce, fetching five cents more. Sutong glutinous rice also fetched a few cents to about ten cents more. Early rice saw no changes. Duyang sharp rice and Yinbianyuan rice were all stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various sources in Hexia remained abundant, with about sixty dealers arriving. Demand for white glutinous rice at stores was even weaker than yesterday. Wholesale transactions were slow, and prices fell slightly by about ten cents. Early rice followed suit, falling by nearly ten cents. Booda rice sales were stagnant, and liquor merchants were quiet, with prices falling slightly by about ten cents. Yangbu sharp rice continued to sell, and prices were stable. Transactions of customer sharp rice were few. All other goods showed signs of weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e178">While Arrivals of Customer Xian Rice Are Not Strong <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market saw arrivals from various sources, but the quantities were not as high as in previous days. Only over two thousand bags of new rice arrived, mainly from Jiangxi and Wenzhou/Taizhou. As arrivals decreased, sales in this district did not stagnate, and the market stabilized. The daily outflow included 2,461 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,200 bags of Wenzhou/Taizhou rice, 189 bags of Hunan rice, and 200 bags of Siamese Yangyuan rice, all handled by this district. There is hope for a market recovery; otherwise, with the end of the year approaching and economic conditions tightening, arrivals will inevitably increase, leading to desperate selling and making it difficult for the market to sustain.</p>
<h3 id="e179">6,000 Bags of Sesame and Raw Goods Sold; No Significant Changes in Soybeans <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price of raw sesame remained at 11.8 yuan due to the difficulty in raising the market price of clean goods at foreign firms. Transactions were limited to only two to three hundred tons. Therefore, the sentiment of cargo owners shifted, leading to transactions involving combined deliveries of stocked goods. Total transactions for various sesame seeds in the city amounted to 6,000 bags. Market trends were initially weak and then stabilized, but the overall trend still depended on the sales of foreign firms.</p>
<p>There were still no significant changes in soybeans. Downward pressure was limited because of high preparation costs and continued interest from manufacturers. Yesterday, 600 bags of Bengbu beans, 600 bags of Luohe green/yellow beans, and 700 bags of Xinyangzhou beans were sold. Arrivals of Zhadou were more abundant, with inquiries from Fuzhou, Ningbo, and local merchants (daily transactions of over 1,000 bags). However, the market sentiment was difficult to stabilize. Doudousha yellow beans maintained a high, stable, and then soft position.</p>

<p>Due to poor harvests this year, the highest-grade Zheng Er first batch of Xinghua longan was initially priced at over 110 yuan. Although prices were high and sales were slow, land prices did not ease as a result. Recently, they have risen further, leading to price increases in Shanghai. Yesterday, the highest-grade Zheng Er reached over 120 yuan in the market. However, other miscellaneous longan varieties, with larger inventories, were very accommodating in the market, and outflow was difficult despite efforts to stimulate demand, with prices slightly softening.</p>

<p>Lately, the woolen overcoat business has been extremely busy for clothing stores. Women's colored overcoat stores in the Fourth Avenue area have been particularly busy because workers have resumed work after the strike. An ordinary Concord women's overcoat generally sells for 65 yuan in national currency, an A-Pang-Sheng overcoat sells for 44 yuan, a Bi-Long collar women's overcoat sells for 33 yuan, a custom-made foreign fox fur overcoat sells for 25-26 yuan, and a ready-made overcoat sells for 19 yuan. A custom-made men's Genuine Old 1005 riding breeches wool-blend overcoat costs 35 foreign yuan per piece, and a new 1005 ready-made overcoat costs 31 yuan. Zhanglan and Japanese riding breeches wool-blend overcoats cost 26-27 yuan. A genuine human-shaped woolen-blend overcoat generally sells for 15-16 yuan, and a second-grade one sells for only 12.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Thursday, at the 2,970th auction of various goods by Hong Fang Foreign Firm, six brands of Taixi satin, totaling 180 bolts, were auctioned, with prices increasing by about four cents per yard compared to the previous week. However, the Xi-Xi-Hu brand decreased by 0.25 cents. There were also two boxes of Yuarong, totaling 40 bolts, with the Jiufang brand increasing by 4.5 cents per yard and the Jiu Xiqi brand remaining unchanged. There were also 37 brands of Yu Yuchou, totaling 1,400 bolts. Prices increased for most brands due to active trading from customer merchants, with the Five Star Human Ball brand seeing the strongest price increase. However, one brand of Hundred Children Picture decreased by 20 cents. There were also 20 bolts of Zhigong Ni, with prices increasing by six cents. Prices for both foreign blue and foreign red cloth, totaling 30 bolts each, also increased slightly.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Promoting the Aviation Industry <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ji</p>
<p>Amidst the intense bombing of undefended cities in Abyssinia by Italian aircraft in East Africa and the continuous reconnaissance of the Pingjin region by aircraft from a certain country, we read two more encouraging pieces of news: First, Xu Qixing, a young overseas Chinese, gained admiration from the Dutch people after successfully flying his self-made aircraft to and from Java in the Netherlands. He was subsequently hired by the Dutch to establish a large-scale aircraft manufacturing factory in Java. Mr. Xu also stated that he intends to take a leave of absence next spring to fly his self-made aircraft back to his homeland, hoping to find an opportunity to serve the country. Second, Li Jingzong, the general manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, is advocating gliding as a preliminary form of flight training. He is currently seeking support from leaders of the Party and the state to jointly initiate the establishment of a Gliding Research Association in Shanghai, with plans to establish branches in various locations in the future.</p>
<p>We know that the 20th century is the age of flight. Since World War I, countries around the world have been striving to promote the aviation industry. Today, it has not only become the sole weapon in military affairs but also has made significant progress in civil aviation. The successful crossing of the Pacific Ocean by the American "China Clipper" (the significance of which we will not discuss for the moment) is one example. Given China's vast territory and inconvenient transportation, the urgent need to develop civil aviation is undeniable. As for military affairs, the lessons of the January 28th Incident are not only deeply imprinted in the minds of the people of Shanghai but also unforgettable for the people of the entire country. Its need is just as urgent as that of civil aviation.</p>
<p>While the promotion of aviation should be planned comprehensively by the government, the enthusiasm of the people for aviation is particularly important. By aviation enthusiasm, I believe that not only should there be enthusiastic material contributions, but there should also be active training in technical aspects, such as mechanical construction, flight techniques, and air defense knowledge, all of which are very important. Although gliding is a preliminary form of flight training, its meaning is significant. As for Mr. Xu's self-made aircraft, its success in inspiring our enthusiasm for aviation extends beyond just the technical aspects. I hope that these two encouraging pieces of news will promote China's nascent aviation industry.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Sea of Emotion <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Emotion is a sea, and my body is like a boat floating on it, drifting with the waves, never still. The sea, the majestic sea of emotion, stretches as far as the eye can see, connecting to the endless sky, deep and unfathomable. The changes in the sea are as unpredictable as the changes in the weather. The sea of emotion may have even more rapidly changing forms. Therefore, my body's boat often faces the possibility of being capsized in the sea of emotion.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a storm breaks out, and the waves of the sea surge like hills. The emotional waves of the sea crash against my body's boat, shaking it violently. At this time, I am calm, letting fate decide, because such encounters are always unavoidable, and there is no way to salvage them. I am prepared for the final sinking of my body's boat, forgetting everything at the same time. But in the end, it has never sunk. After enduring several attacks from the wind and waves, my body's boat, although still without leaks or holes, has been worn down into an exceptionally old and dilapidated state.</p>
<p>The movement of the sea of emotion is immeasurable, capable of destroying everything when it roars suddenly, and capable of carrying everything when it calms down. The body's boat carried on the sea of emotion holds my life, as well as some hopes and some aspirations, along with some fears and some tremblings. I am constantly worried that the unprovoked waves of emotion will engulf the boat, but when it remains unchanged for a long time, the boat forgets its worries and sails leisurely and slowly, as if harboring a kind of curiosity for the thrill of encountering danger.</p>
<p>I am just a boat drifting in the heart of the sea of emotion.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Separation <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>Friend, after wandering in a distant ancient city for a year, you have now quietly returned, still dragging a listless body and a pair of tired eyes, like a shadow.</p>
<p>After a long separation during which we had no opportunity to exchange letters, you brought a belly full of sights and feelings from afar (how fragmented they are!) to visit me from a great distance. We shook hands, and in an instant, we both felt each other's indescribable hardship and unease. We both fell silent involuntarily, and all the carefully prepared greetings after the separation were snatched away by the terrible black hand of deathly silence.</p>
<p>Who can say anything, who can tell anyone anything pleasant! We have helplessly lost the courage to make perfunctory greetings - what we saw from each other's tired bodies and angry eyes was a pile of fragments of life! We are both capable of explaining each other's lives with our own. Why must we drag out unpleasant, fragmented pieces? - That is useless, that is foolish, that is meddlesome and cruel.</p>
<p>But, silent and silent, I finally said:</p>
<p>"Now, you have finally returned. After living in the ancient city for a year, what is the scenery of the ancient city like? Tell me a little about it."</p>
<p>Blinking his eyes and turning his pale face away, he said softly: "Yes, I have returned. The ancient city is still the same ancient city; but it is no longer our world."</p>
<p>The voice was so calm, so low, so low that it was even difficult to distinguish its words. However, these words, falling gently into our ears, were like a top-violent bomb, with a loud sound like a big thunder, shaking the bottom of people's hearts.</p>
<p>And the buzzing voice continued as calmly as the rocks on a desolate mountain: "The ancient city is no longer our world. It is no longer suitable for our lives, so I came back."</p>
<p>The tone was calm, but this calm tone struck my heart anxiously and violently, like the cold winter night's storm. I trembled: "There will be no place in this world that is ours! There will be no place for us to live everywhere! That is the tragedy of a hard and humiliating era..."</p>
<p>Silence was almost about to occupy the cold space of this small room again. We were both afraid of this man-eating silence! So, my friend began to move his pale and colorless lips and uttered some other words: "And you, how are you living? How are you passing the days? People cannot go back to thinking about the past days - a year has passed."</p>
<p>"Yes, a year has passed," I was at a loss: a year has passed, and how viciously has life punished me in this year? What words shall I use to tell him? Where shall I start? Life is a pile of shattered pieces, and these pieces are so broken and incomplete that they cannot be put back together. What is good for me to say?</p>
<p>However, I finally said: "Alas, life is so bad, it is very much like a poisonous whip that cannot be broken..."</p>
<p>"Stop! Stop! Don't say any more! Don't anymore..."</p>
<p>He shouted like a madman; and, following this shout, we were silent again. An invisible whip danced flexibly on our bodies, circling, waving...</p>
<p>The night fell silently, and the small room was unusually dark. Winter was already deep, and the wind was whistling outside. I seemed to still hear: "It is no longer our world."</p>
<p>My friend stood up, nodded, and dragged his long, thin shadow out wordlessly. I followed him to the door, shook his hand, and then slowly stepped onto the cold street and walked away.</p>
<p>Looking at his back, I said so much: "A year has passed."</p>
<h3 id="e186">Li Sandie <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>The sun floated above the treetops to the east, and its scorching rays shone directly through the small window onto the floor, warming Li Sandie's naked belly and waking him up.</p>
<p>Li Sandie prided himself on being an old foreigner, whose habits were just like those of the dark-skinned aborigines. He didn't need to "shower" early in the morning, just as the sun was about to peek out. He often faced the "new foreigners" who had just come from "Tangshan" (China), grinning with his dark teeth, half lecturing and half boasting: "You are new here, you can't be greedy for sleep early in the morning. Before the sun comes out, you have to get up and "shower" - don't be afraid of the cold, pour water straight down from the top of your head, and you won't get sick, you won't be unacclimatized. - You are not like me, I have even warmed up the ground! Haha, new customers"!</p>
<p>He jumped up in one go, walked down the dirt steps, and used his two palms as gourds to scoop water from the water barrel and splash it on his face, considering it his face wash. Then, he pulled out a five-cent "Style Dan" (Siamese currency) from his waistband, bought a pack of bamboo leaf rice from the aborigine squatting at the door, and ate it as breakfast. After that, he picked up his bamboo pole and walked out of the low, dilapidated fence gate.</p>
<p>Not far from the fence gate was an earthen slope, on which stood many tall palm trees with dense, lush green leaves. Beneath them was a low, thatched-roof hut, which was the Xing Lao Er's wine shop. Although the signboard was so mottled that the words on it could not be recognized, everyone who lived here knew about "Xing Ji Wine Shop," the oldest wine shop there!</p>
<p>Li Sandie looked at Xing Ji Wine Shop and felt his throat itching a little. He thought to himself, how flavorful it would be to have half a jin of white spirits to drink. It felt as if his strength would increase after drinking the wine. But as soon as he thought of how Xing's boss had been pressing him hard for the considerable amount of his overdue wine bill, his heart felt as cold as if it had been doused with cold water.</p>
<p>"What's there to be afraid of? The wine bill has to be paid anyway - what does it matter if I owe a little more"! Li Sandie's desire for wine had already surged, and muttering to himself, his feet involuntarily turned to the entrance of Xing Ji Wine Shop.</p>
<p>The plump Xing boss was standing at the counter, his face full of smiles, busily attending to his business. He glanced at Li Sandie and his smile immediately faded, and he put on a cold face and said:</p>
<p>"Li Sandie, your wine bill must be paid today no matter what. It's not that I'm not being friendly, you know, the Mid-Autumn Festival is right around the corner - I also have to pay my wine bill to the people above." He ignored him and turned his head to welcome other customers.</p>
<p>This made Li Sandie embarrassed to step inside. At the same time, looking at Xing's boss's cold face, he felt a little unconvinced in his stomach. "Hmm, I'll give it to you in a while." He walked to the pier by the creek in a huff.</p>
<p>The pier was quiet and calm, without a single cargo ship. The reddish river water reflected the hot, dazzling sunlight, rippling with a myriad of golden waves, meandering and flowing peacefully.</p>
<p>The scorching sun had already moved overhead, making his head feel as if he were wearing a pot of blazing flames. "The Mid-Autumn Festival is in two days, why haven't the cargo ships come yet"? Looking at the empty river center, he couldn't help but feel anxious. So, he remembered the words his friend had said to him before: "Li Sandie, it would be more appropriate for you to find a business shop to work as a clerk." At that time, when he heard these words from his friend, a few points of pride would always appear in his heart, and he would reply with a smile, "I don't have any family burdens, I don't need to send letters home every month. This kind of life feels free, better, and happier! ...When I'm happy, I'll sell a few more jin of strength, when I'm unhappy, I'll take a nap all day, and I won't get anyone's anger or "Mang Ge" (restrictions). ..." At that time, he was so proud and admired by others.</p>
<p>Li Sandie knew that business was hopeless. At the same time, his stomach began to rumble again. So, he stretched a little, picked up his bamboo pole, and dragged his heavy footsteps back home.</p>
<p>Several hours of gazing at the riverbank had made him feel particularly tired in body and mind. As soon as he lay down on the floor, he fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>"Li Sandie, are you sleeping well? - My boss wants you to pay your wine bill"! Xing Ji Wine Shop's clerk woke him up.</p>
<p>"Damn it! There are still two days until the festival - I'm not going to run away from you."</p>
<p>Now, paying Xing's boss's wine bill was no longer on Li Sandie's mind. What was on his mind was: "It would be deadly if I don't have wine to drink for three days"!</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Bay in Early Winter <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>In the morning, the pale yellow sun spread flat on the sloping sandy beach. The wind of early winter, however, swam in the air, with a few withered leaves, like small gudgeons in muddy water, having nowhere to hide, and finally being knocked down. Only the catbrier bushes on the stone embankment still held up their needle-sharp green leaves, stubbornly squatting there. Occasionally, a gust of sea breeze would run over and pull at them, but they would merely shake their heads and remain quietly seated as before.</p>
<p>Along the beach, a row of not very neat fishing boats crowded together, about thirteen or fourteen of them. Each boat had three masts erected, and on the tip of each mast hung a large fishing net, forming a triangle that drooped below, like a row of large banners, fluttering in the sea breeze, which was quite a sight to behold.</p>
<p>On the stern of each of these fishing boats, breakfast was being cooked. Wisps of white smoke rose from under the tarpaulin, scattering into the air, allowing it to mix with the morning mist over the sea. The men were wiping away the heavy frost from the flat bases and gangways with damp mops, while some children jumped onto the beach to pick up seashells and pebbles.</p>
<p>Uncle Dasheng was on the bow of the boat, mending a broken fishing net under the sun. He stitched it together stitch by stitch, revealing a layer of undisguised melancholy and gloom on his dark and wrinkled face. Two streams of clear snot crawled out of his nostrils like green snakes, stretching towards his mouth. He wore only an old padded jacket with the cotton wadding already squeezed out of the holes. Under the sun, his two dry hands still trembled while holding a bamboo shuttle. However, that broken fishing net was as old and useless as he was himself. After mending one hole on the east side, another one appeared on the west side, and the net line was already brittle, so that with just a slight pull, it would tear into another hole. Yet he still had to rely on that broken net for a living, just as Dasheng's family of five had to rely on him, and he was unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>"This net is truly useless," he said, pushing it from his lap onto the flat base. Then, he pulled up another section and said, flipping it over, "I should have made a new one long ago, but... making a new one would cost more than ten dollars, and more than ten dollars is not easy to come by in this situation!"</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years, he had been so weighed down by life that he could barely breathe. Business was bad, the burden of feeding his family was heavy, and there was often panic about meals. Where would he find the money to make a new net or add hooks? Even that old fishing boat had not been ashore for repairs or painting in more than ten years.</p>
<p>"Dad, it's time to eat!" While he was holding the broken net, lost in thought, his second son, Sanmao, called him for breakfast. Dasheng tightly rolled up the broken net, tossed it beside the rudder, lowered his head, and crawled into the tarpaulin tent.</p>
<p>"Today is a southeasterly wind. If the wind doesn't change this afternoon, it will definitely change tomorrow," Dasheng said after eating breakfast, wiping his mouth and standing on the bow to look at the sea. He saw that the damp mist was gradually receding, and the seashore had become much brighter. However, the muddy southeasterly wind continued to blow, dimming the sun's light.</p>
<p>"Dahuo, eat quickly. Let's go to the East Sea shallows early and set up the weirs," he said to his eldest son as he rolled up the tarpaulin.</p>
<p>"Are we going to pull them up after only a few days of setting them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I think it's better to pull them up, to save them from being washed away by the waves in a strong wind!" His wife echoed in agreement.</p>
<p>More than a dozen fishing boats along the seashore had all rolled up their tarpaulins, tidied up their awning foot ropes, and sailed out onto the sea in succession. The iron anchors that had been submerged in the water were now all hoisted onto the bow of each boat.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the bay was quiet and still, with not a single boat to be seen. Except for the surging of the waves and a few seabirds hopping on the sandy beach, the surroundings were left with only a boundless desolation!</p>
<p>The sky still wore a melancholic face, never showing a smile from morning until dusk. And the fishing boats had not yet returned.</p>
<p>Broadcasting</p>
<p>Boatman's Song</p>
<p>The Yangtze River flows eastward, slowly, slowly. Large and small boats travel east and west, upstream and downstream. Back and forth, the river flows long, back and forth, for ages. The morning sun shines, the river waves gleam. In the deep night, the bright moon reflects on the sandbar. Silly poets praise the boatman's joy, but who knows the boatman's sorrow!</p>
<p>The boatman's life relies on drifting, drifting, drifting. Eastward and westward, without stopping, with the current and against the current. Busy times mean no rest from the heat, idle times mean suffering from hunger. Paying taxes and dues, no money means committing a crime. The whole family's life is entrusted to the boat. Sometimes encountering fierce storms, the entire family perishes at once!</p>

<p>Opening Chapter Pearl Tower "Falling Snow"</p>
<p>Dense clouds brew snow, snow condenses into ice, a sick Fang Qing is exhausted. He feels the mountain pass opening with the dawn, forgetting that the world has dusk. Heaven, with a cruel heart, blocks the mountain traveler. The piercing cold and sudden illness strike him, calling me, how can I walk when the snow beats and the wind blows? Seeing the lone goose following the lone traveler, fearing that it is not a traveler but a broken soul. Braving wind and frost, what is the meaning? Is it perhaps that Xiao Zheng is like me, seeking relatives far away? The winding path is hard to recognize, the road is rugged, and the lion's roar is frightening. The land is rugged and the sky is dark, even more pitiful that I am all alone. Moreover, where can I find an inn in a hurry? Wind gusts, snow falls, the mud is slippery, the night is deep, unable to distinguish the third watch from the fourth. Shredding and kneading cotton, the sky refuses to clear. Tonight, where can I stay? One step, one tear, one heartbreak. On the poor road, waving tears of longing for home, a band of mice from Bangxiao truly sees, and fake orangutans team up to overturn the traveler's bag.</p>
