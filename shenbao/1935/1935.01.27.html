<h3 id="c32">中東路讓渡以後之日俄局勢　執 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>據前日路透東京電。日僞在東京談判達一年有七閱月之中東路讓渡問題。經四十次之長期折衝而後。卒於本月二十二日晨間。獲得雙方原則上之最後妥恊。正式解决之期。在指顧間。則其成功。已爲確定之事實吾人在今日回憶此項賣買談判之經過。雙方交涉。時張時弛。極盡撲朔迷離之能事。誠令人莫測其手段之高下。勝利之誰屬。顧由茲獲得同意之條欵以觀。則日僞亦未能遽視爲絶對勝利。蓋僞方雖須付出一萬四千萬日元之代價。而俄方所得現欵。不逾五千萬元。表面上俄國似不合算。然而中東路在今日。已不如昔日富有經濟上之價値。亦爲彰明較著之事。是則吾人欲論斷此項談判之所以卒告妥恊。不能僅就中東路本身之利益言。而當於國際外交舞台上所生之影響求之矣。</p>
<p>夫中東路自俄與我國共同經營以來。其間雖迭起糾紛。然論中俄間過去對於該路之關係。本屬彼此共有。今俄與日僞突然成此交易。爲我國立塲計。自不能同意於此種賣買。而亟當鄭重表示。以維「不承認」一貫之方針。然而東北四省之土地。且强佔以去。則此區區中東路之路權旁落。又何暇問。空言爭論。奚補實際。故吾人對此問題。今日所當明白認識者。卽是項交涉之成立。與遠東和平大局之意義何如耳。</p>
<p>問嘗論之。日俄在東北。本爲兩國勢力接觸之地。自九一八事變旣作。日本在經濟上之勢力。日形膨脹。俄自不能不放棄其中東路之權益。但俄國於其他軍事上之計劃。亦肯隨以退讓乎。日本於中東路經濟利益以外。不有其他進一步之希望乎。此實爲最要之問題。昨俄眞理報論日政府努力謀解决日俄間懸案事。謂「日外相竟以爲蘇俄擬鬆懈其遠東邊防。則殊使人驚異。如以俄政府在遠東之計劃。爲在進攻而非防守。可謂荒謬。」可知兩方於其他軍事上政治上種種猜忌之心。尙未稍見消釋。况據最近電訊。黑省僞軍忽又與外蒙俄軍發生衝突。華聯社電謂。外蒙俄軍佔領貝爾湖附近漁塲。又佔據該池北方三河合流之三角地帶。遂與日僞軍發生衝突。僞軍死傷甚衆。現日僞援軍已到。正在激戰中。而俄方如何解說。則尙未明白。惟據路透社揣測。此事將否嚴重發展。尙屬疑問。倘如外蒙派兵援助。日軍勢必出而干涉。則範圍難保不擴大云云。則此次日僞與俄軍之衝突。前途如何甚難逆料。夫日僞與俄中東路讓渡之成交。纔三數日耳。一般人咸以爲日俄感情。可從此漸向好轉。乃不旋踵而卽有漁池衝突之事。雖或僅爲邊疆偶然之細故。未必爲雙方當局願意擴大。然亦可見日俄之間。隨處可以發生糾紛。隨處可以釀成戰事之導火綫。故或僅據中東路妥恊一事。以論遠東。謂爲有裨於和平大局者。恐尙非深識遠東時局之言也。</p>

<p>日軍企圖　日本少壯派以國際形勢日益險恶、乃積極凖備、以謀一逞、其對華方針、不滿外交派之漸進步驟、提出責難、在大連召集所謂領袖會議、主張急進、并鑒於蘇聯在庫倫之增兵運械、認爲察東察北通庫倫各處、爲其軍事必爭之地、非攫爲己有、預先佈置、不足以操勝算、兩月以來、在熱西大閣·大灘·多倫·一帶積極凖備、以謀侵擾、及至最近、私人間一度非正式的提出無理要求、未得結果、本月中旬、乃又藉口長梁·烏泥河·南北石柱子一帶、係屬熱河豐寗縣屬、聲言不惜出以軍事行動、盤馬彎弓、意在攫得察省長城以外各重鎭、以爲其軍事上之據點、其心目中之企圖、儻以和平達到、固無問題、否則不惜訴諸武力、種種步驟、早經擬定、現已開始逐步實行矣、</p>

<p>交涉經過　日方對於察事一度私人間非正式提出無理要求未得結果以後、沉靜數日、自熱西日僞軍與長梁一帶民團衝突以來、雙方認爲地方交涉、一面派員調查、一面由日使館武官高橋致電駐熱日軍、阻止前方日僞軍前進、同時由秦德純兵開先在張家口與日方駐張垣聯絡員松井、開始接洽、松井啣日軍之命、提議互派代表在大灘恊商、自前日日軍開軍事行動以後、平方迭接張垣來電、昨日軍分會例會、一度提出討論、今（二十四）日上午十時、宋哲元又晋謁何應欽請示、關係方面曾電中央報告、現在雙方交涉仍未中斷、首謀停止前方軍事行動、前途如何、尙難逆料、</p>
<p>宋哲元談　今晨據察主席宋哲元談、昨日（二十三）日軍向東栅子獨石口外攻擊、直至下午七時始止、據調查、日軍向東栅子投擲炸彈、開放大砲四十餘發、民團及居民死傷四十餘人、該方我無駐軍、並未接觸、日方曾有無理要求、我正據理力爭、本人留平、返察期未定、</p>

<p>丨中日關係的檢討丨</p>
<p>四　中國方面之錯誤與失計</p>
<p>中國方面對於造成如此巨大事變、雖然不能與日本負同樣的責任，但回溯九一八前後以至今日，造成如此難解的僵局，中國實不能說一無認識上或舉措上的錯誤，這種錯誤，有屬於政府的，有屬於民衆的，有政府與民間所應共認錯誤的，現在槪舉如下：</p>
<p>（一）失却時機的錯誤　當民國十九年以前，我們也曾聽得國民政府有解决商租權問題的傾向，彼時日本還没有簽認關約，一切縣案尙在待决的時期，後來聽說因爲國民政府内部意見的不一致，把商租權問題擱起。本來日本對國民革命，疑阻百端，中國國民黨引不起對日的好感，是無怪其然的，但國際之間，友敵何嘗有一定刻板的標準，苟利於國，應屏絶嫌怨而爲之，可惜當局無此勇氣，坐失良機，否則彼時日本軍人派尚未抬頭，政黨威望，也未减低，兩國關係或可藉此好轉，九一八事件的誘因，亦或可不致發生。及至九一八事變旣起，彼時中國輿情昂奮異常，但也有一部份人燭及危機，主張相機及早解决。例如胡適之先生等即有不惜依據日本所提五項原則，毅然直接交涉的主張，當局終於遲迴却顧，堅持不撤兵不交涉之原則，致使日本緩和派不能抬頭，軍人氣勢日張，問題愈陷僵化。就是瀋陽陷落尙未侵入關内的時候，也還有使日本止於錦州以徐圖轉換局勢的可能，可惜步步錯過，以造成此後不可收拾的局面，這不能不說當局没有决心及不負責任之所致。</p>
<p>（二）不澈底實行革命方略的錯誤　上面這一段話，或者有人以爲事後論人，失之太苛，中國對日仇恨，造因旣遠，深刻普遍，再加以如此突然的重大刺激，當局縱欲委曲謀國，何能抑制人民的反感，而免内部之不安。殊不知我們所言，乃以責望於以革命救國自任的中國國民黨。所謂革命外交之不同於通常外交者，即在不被動而能自動，不固執而能因應，應剛則剛，應柔則柔，能伸則伸，當屈則屈，完全以變動不居的方略來實現不可變易的目的。史例具在，豈不聞列寗力排衆意與德國言和的往事。乃左支右絀，陷於旣不能强又不能弱的地位。我們反顧九一八以來的經過，縱不言當局無挽回危局之意思，要不能不認爲缺少當機立斷的勇氣。於此吾人愈益追思國家當艱危之際，尤需要有偉大之政治家，今中國國民黨當局旣缺眞誠，復乏智勇，結果自陷於進退不能的僵局，雖欲不謂爲負國負民，亦何可得！</p>
<p>（三）判斷對方的錯誤　九一八事變發生以後，中國國民對於日本情形之判斷，謬誤不止一端。當時一般見解，以爲中國兵力雖不如人，而抵貨運動，即可爲代用之武器，所以對日萬不可妥恊，祗要抵貨運動支持一年半載，日本國内必大起經濟及政治上之騷擾，雖欲不放棄東北而不得。殊不知中國欲自固抵貨運動的陣綫，已將費甚大之力量，受很深的痛苦，而同時又没有看清楚日本支持能力的久暫，以及其軍國主義支配下的國民心理，這是一種很大的錯誤。再則中國在九一八以後，還以爲日本雖肇此巨禍，畢竟不能不顧慮國際的反感，也不能完全抛却對國際條約的責任，而豈知日本這一個國家，爲獨霸太平洋混一東亞的野心所驅使，處心積慮，早已視國際條約爲具文，而且認各種條約爲束縛其野心發展的鎖鍊，本不能以守約守信義的通常國家相看待。中國當時並且有一部分人以爲侵佔東北祇是日本軍閥的主張，民間開明的輿論，必能抑制軍人的猖狂，所以當時中國輿論，還紛紛揣度民政政友兩黨勢力的消長，以爲因應之標準。豈知日本並非通常政黨國家或立憲國家而爲一種由特殊階級軍閥把持一切的特殊國家，這種錯誤到後來日本脫退國際聯盟及五一五犬養白畫被刺以後，亦已完全證明，但在當時，確甚流行。</p>
<p>（四）審察自力的錯誤　中國當時不但不知彼實亦不知己，對於自身力量，不是誇張太過，就是信賴過甚，祇判斷敵人的缺點，無暇反省亦無意承認自己的弱點，一般人民激於義憤，其至自信短刀可以制飛機，單靠無近代配備的陸軍，可以參加現代的戰爭，高呼宣戰，力促出兵，使當時政府解釋無從，因應不易。這種虚驕的呼喊，暴露自身外强中乾的弱點，適以張日本軍人的氣勢，固可嘆惜，其實也不僅民間觀察錯誤，就是政府判斷彼我情形，也有矛盾錯誤的所在。當時軍事方面，在日本發動侵入熱河之時，過信東北軍隊爲有利用險要相當抵禦的力量，以爲日本如不從他國内再運六師以上的兵力，决不敢侵入熱河，初不知東北駐守熱河之軍隊，精神實力，頽敗至此，這是審察自力的錯誤。</p>
<p>（五）觀察第三者的錯誤　中國當時不但對彼我兩方缺乏眞切的認識，即觀察第三者的實情，亦不能盡得其眞相。當時中國自政府以至人民，總以爲國聯盟約具在，日本爲盟約國之一，如其悍然不顧，聯盟必能依照約章，實施經濟的制裁，同時又以爲英美或其他國家，如友誼的斡旋無效，亦必能爲保障盟約尊嚴，或保障世界和平，起而作有力之干涉。不知英美諸國，方各有本身之困難，蘇俄亦正埋頭作外交内政之準備，顯然不能有積極的行動，世界經濟凋敝之秋，各國愈惴惴於和平之破裂，日本愈無顧忌。其後英美諸國之干涉固然不見事實，而國聯除幾次决議以外無表示，除所謂道德同情以外，亦更無力量。當時這種判斷的錯誤，三年後的今日，也已證明。</p>
<p>（六）内部凌亂的錯誤　中國方面彼時一方面旣以虚驕不能自掩其弱點，同時復不能固守外交之秘密，往往政府尙未决策，民間已自喧騰，一舉一動，世界咸得窺見其隱微。實力上頃刻之間不能强，而體面上又種種牽制不能弱，中國兪表示其虚驕，日本軍閥的氣勢愈盛。中國對於日本之着着逼進，旣恥辱又憤恨，自祇有訴之於世界的公道，而日本的當局，遂以中國信賴聯盟及期望英美的事實，向日本國民高呼「中國襲用以夷制夷的政策」以激刺日本國民的感情，使開明派的主張愈見没落，而事變擴大更無止境。其時中國内部，當局與人民不相一致，人民各派間不能一致，中國國民黨與黨外不能一致，甚而至於中國國民黨内部，更於此時因外交主張而顯現分裂，因之内亂與外患益見嚴重，吾人回溯往事，眞覺不忍畢言。</p>
<p>（七）感情用事的錯誤　以上所舉認識上及還斷上措施上種種錯誤，有許多已成過去，也還有一部分沿襲未改。關於造成過去局勢的諸種錯誤，已無須乎追求，所重祇在自今以後能否不再沿襲從前觀事不審，决謀不勇的錯誤，吾人默察國内，此事亦祇能作爲一種之期望而目前尙難爲肯定。作者上文已明言中日僵局必須打開，吾人明知中日問題主動完全在日本，打開僵局的第一步，必先日本有覺悟之誠意與放棄侵佔的表示，但日本如果表示欲開始交涉時，中國方面恐尙有不能贊成直接談判者，中國受此空前的屈辱與侵侮，感情之激張，自是意中之事，但吾人認爲「同歸於盡」的辦法，决不是辦法，日本如橫行到底，中國自然應該出死力以謀掙扎，凡在國民，誰不同感，但「死中求生」畢竟是最後無其他辦法時的辦法，如果能從「生裏求生」總應該抑感情以重理智，爲國家民族計及於久遠。此一觀念如不解放，恐中日僵局，亦尙留多少障碍，不能澈底打開，長此以往，一味的因循僵持，終非國家民族之福。</p>
<p>五　日本方面的錯誤（一）</p>
<p>·······直接的對中國認識之錯誤</p>
<p>論到造成事變以迄今日不能打開僵局的原因，日本方面的錯誤，較之中國方面的錯誤當然更多。日本方面首先對中國的認識陷於根本上的錯誤。基於此種根本錯誤的認識，而下判斷作打算，於是有種種計慮上的錯誤。同時又因爲造成事變以後，一迷不復，爲因應國際而其所採取的手段，亦陷於錯誤，現在且先說日本對中國認識之錯誤：</p>
<p>（一）對中國目前國情認識的錯誤　我前文曾說日本没有方法消滅中國的存在，其最重要的理由，即中國現在方在革命期間，在革命未成期間的國家，與通常已有强固而確定的組織的國家完全不同。日本人以通常國家視方在革命中的中國，與中國人以通常國家視軍權支配下特殊的日本，其錯誤正復相等，在通常已有固家組織的國家，誰都知道其要素爲「土地人民與主權（或政府）」，但近世革命的史例，已詔示我們在革命期中的國家，與通常國家完全不同，其要素則爲「主義，領袖與羣衆」。這三個要素，論羣衆，則中國有廣大的人口，而因外侮的緊迫造成了許多民族意識堅强的愛國之士；論主義，則中國近七八年來三民主義畢竟已成爲舉國一致的國是，中國人容有不滿意於國民黨當局的措施，但絶少有反對三民主義者，中國的智識階級，現在已公認唯有鞭策國民黨努力自愛，中國始可以對外；而自九一八以來，在事實上中國已造成了一個可以提挈全國國民的黨及其事實上的領袖。所以只要主義普遍深入，領袖健全存在，羣衆一致擁護，一時政府的成敗或土地的得失，轉成爲次要問題。中國國民政府現在本自命爲臨時革命政府，而非革命完成後的政府，所以我上文說，佔領了中國首都，不能制中國的死命，如果不能消滅他的領袖，則領袖之所在，即中國政府與國力中心之所在。日本人以爲軍事行動繼續進行，國土日蹙，中國便不能生存，豈知革命期中之國家，不可以尋常國家相視。中國國民黨嘗鼓勵國民「已失之東北四省應認爲一九二○年以前俄國之西比利亞」，我不是黨員，對此語不願下判斷，但中國尙爲革命期中之國家，則爲不爭之事實。由此以言，如領袖依然存在的時候，日本人决没有澈底消滅中國的把握，只可惜日本的中國通，對於中國事情，平時一切調查觀察，異常精密周到，而獨忽略此重要之一着。</p>
<p>（二）對中國歷史與時代認識的錯誤　日本人自命能通中國的歷史，以爲漢族爲主的中國，在六百餘年前可以亡於蒙古人，在三百年前亡於滿洲人，何嘗不可於今日亡於日本人之統治，此又爲一種觀察之錯誤。因在宋末或明末時代，中國人民除少數儒者外，幾直不知有更易朝代，或少數民族入主中國的一回事，但在二十餘年前推翻滿清的時候，則不僅革命先覺起而奔起，也有多數民衆參加其間，滿清統治的推翻，是同盟會「驅除韃虜，恢復中華，建立民國，平均地權」四句口號所號召，辛亥革命在中國歷史上劃一顯明的時期，與從前易姓改代截然不同。自此以後，至少人民已了解民族主義的意義，至於今日全國在學的大中小學生一千二百萬是具有深固的民族意識的，加以前清以來，凡是識字的成年國民，以總人口百分之十計算，也有四千八百萬人，皆知道亡國是怎樣一回事。就以日本呑併臺灣朝鮮爲例，在三四十年前，或者中國多數國民尙不知臺灣朝鮮與中國有怎樣關係，因而不感痛癢的，在今日有許多地方，即在田夫野老，也知道東北四省被佔的事實，這不是任何力量，這是時代變遷的結果。即使以六千萬人來說，其數量也已與日本總人口數相近，日本的武力雖强，終不能除盡此六千萬具有充分民族意識的國民，而使全中國帖然服從日本作順民，所以拿宋明亡國史例來推斷今日之中國，實又是一種錯誤。再則日本人觀察中國歷史，往往祇從壞的方面去找中國的缺點，而不從好的方面去研究中國民族的特性。中國歷代以來所以能屢蹶屢興，不受制於外族，就因爲中國有見危授命的民族精神和累世相傳的所謂天地間之正氣。這種精神和正氣，在危亡末運之際，常藉忠臣志士可歌可泣的行爲來表現，而歷代師儒遺民著書倡導，播之歌謠戲劇，成爲中國主要的社會敎育。這一種遞相傳授的敎育，根基異常深厚，幾乎中國人的血液中先天就多少帶些這種敎育影響的。即如近代中國的主要人物中，也還有常常引用諸葛武候「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已，成敗利鈍，匪所逆覩」以及「威武不能屈，貧賤不能移」等說法，作爲碈礪志節的格言。所以日本人不應該祇看見宋明亡國時的情形，而不看見元末清末中國民族再起時的情形，不應祗看見有宋朝的秦檜張邦昌，而不看見岳武穆與文文山賳不應祇看見明末的洪承疇吳三桂而不看見史可法鄭成功。到了近二十年民國時代，日本一般後起的中國通，更不應祇看見袁世凱等帝制自私的軍閥行逕，而忽視了孫中山先生等革命救國的犧牲精神。要知道這種精神和正氣，向來是瀰漫於中國民族之間，更加以近代民族主義的灌輸，使這種精神更有所寄託而爲更大的發揮，所以觀察中國民族，决不能以少數無恥軍閥官僚作代表，而以爲一槪可以威脅利誘的。這一層意義，在日本新進的「中國通」，實在太不瞭解，但日本現存的老師宿儒中間，還不少通曉東洋史實，瞭解中國民族的老輩，倘以此義相質，一定許作者之言爲不謬。</p>
<p>（三）對中國國民黨觀察的錯誤　日本方面還有兩種錯誤的見解，其一以爲中國國民黨是發動排日勢力的中心，其二以爲非打倒中國國民黨則中日問題無法解决，日本不能安枕，這又是根本的錯誤。我在本文開始時已說明：在中國，講明中日兩國唇齒相依的道理，要算國民黨總理孫中山先生爲最澈底。依理而論，日本在國民革命發展之時機，正是清算兩國過去不快之關係，而澈底更新國交的絶好機會。在民國十六年以後的國民黨，明白放棄容工政策，尤其没有使日本害怕的理由。吾人從國民黨歷史及其人物之分析而觀，實在看不出有排日成分之存在。平心而論，一個擁有百萬以上黨員的黨，其黨内各個分子行動之不能絶對一致，恐怕在世界各國皆然，伴於中日感情之惡化，國民黨黨員與一般國民懷抱同樣對日怨望之心理，當然不免，但國民黨的幹部人員，自孫中山先生以下，與日本公使各方有友誼交往與智識交換的，不在少數。所以在中國言，能理解東亞存亡關鍵，能理解日本並能理解中日應平等提携而不該交惡以兩敗的，國民黨向來的理論是比較清楚的。即以近事而論，日本試一翻閱一九三一年以前的對華輸出貿易額，並檢取一九三二年以後各年的對華貿易額，而視其消長之數，即可見日本對華貿易數量顯出逐漸恢復的趨勢，（日貨輸華的數目，僅從海關統計，不能完全表現）即爲國民黨當局不願兩國關係更趨緊張之政策的反映。中國現在正有一部分國民對國民黨此種緩和政策，深致其不滿。余敢言國民政府如放任人民排日，兩國關係益見緊張，固不待言，而日本在經濟上之損失，必將不可以計數，所以日本如認國民黨爲策動排日中心，斷然爲一種錯誤。其次中國國民對日感情之惡化，一步一步都是日本自己所造成，决非國民黨宜傳鼓勵之所能致，若謂日本不自動改善對中國之政策，而祇以排除國民黨爲消弭反日氣勢之手段，則我敢代表非中國國民黨員之一般國民，直認日本此種觀察爲謬誤。日本近來的用意，不知眞如其表面所云爲消除排日而要打倒國民黨呢？抑或認定國民黨爲使日本不能絶對支配中國之障碍而要打倒國民黨呢？無論由何種方面說，中國國民黨在此十年以内是没有一種力量所能推翻的。試看在九一八以前，中國國内，還不少有反對國民黨與蔣氏的呼聲，而自日本侵佔東北以後，外侮日深，國民黨之根基反愈見鞏固，至今反對國民黨與蔣氏之言論行動，轉見其减少，國民黨内部之支離破裂，雖依然深刻，而國民則因日本傾力欲打擊國民黨，反從而表示其同情與愛護，這豈不是一個極顯明的例證？且中國國民黨之能存在於中國，自有其必然的理由，換言之，其存在的根據不全在於其本身，而無寗謂寄於客觀之形勢。國民黨内部之一盤散沙，無可爲諱，其組織與精神，違反近代式的地方也很多，甚至於各爭意氣，自相殘害，即其内在的矛盾，實屬不勝枚舉，但外人欲以皮相之觀察而斷定其運命，則爲不切於事理。試觀民國二年以來北方軍閥迭次假助外國最强的力量以謀消滅國民黨者，無所不至，而每次壓迫的結果，轉使國民黨的勢力益見擴張，雖以最陰鷙的第三國際共產黨，亦不能達到消滅國民黨的目的。民國十五年三月以後，蘇俄鮑羅廷且自謂没有看清楚國民黨内有如此堅强的人格，至於今日，則更非任何外力所得而推翻。因國民黨今日所以能屹然存在，是依於三種的因素：一爲歷史的使命，有中國如此之歷史，即必然有中國國民黨。二爲時代的使命，在今日的世界與時代，就必然在中國有担負時代使命的國民黨。三爲民衆的心理，因中國處於如此情况之下，民族意識就自然要求有一個領導中心的力量和組織。所以無論國民黨决不能推翻，即使推翻以後，中國也還必然的有領導民族對外的一種組織，無論國民黨的領袖不能消滅，即使消滅以後，也還必有第二第三的或者更爲堅强有力的領袖繼之而興。由此推論，如日本尙有此種誤解，以爲祇須推倒中國國民黨或打擊其領袖而使之没落，則中國即無對外之中心勢力，此實倒果爲因之論。即如日本人之意，中國國民黨的統治將不勝外力之壓迫而崩倒，然國民黨目前之困境，爲以一種革命的組織而正面當國家之難關，受了政治責任上的牽制與束縛，遂到處表露其竭蹶矛盾之態，一旦不居於政府地位，拘忌一空，行動自如，則其對外的力量必較居於政府地位時爲尤大。日本必能明悉窺伺於中國國民黨之後者爲何種勢力，此種勢力之抬頭與東亞將生如何之影響，且國民黨旣居在野地位以後，其百餘萬黨員及所能支配之軍事力量，被迫而取不顧一切的手段，日本亦不難想像其結果爲如何。所以日本如眞爲其本國利害着想，此種謬誤，應黨要根本糾正。（未完）</p>

<p>主席報告　主席孔祥熙報告、今日爲本會第六屆年會、在過去一年中、承各位社會人士之熱心指導、本會同人之努力從事、會務已有很多之進步、去年全國慈幼領袖會議之召集、更有重大意義、在該會議、有所提出討論之問題、及决定之各項議案、均非常滿意、慈幼事業、關係國家社會、至爲重要、蓋今日之幼童、即他日社會之一切領袖、値茲國家多難之秋、欲使挽救此危機、悉賴個個人能爲國家社會忠實之服務、我人欲養成能充分的爲國家社會服務之人才、則幼童時期之敎養工作、不可稍加忽視、如幼童時代之敎養不周、則將如何期待其爲國家社會服務時、得有充分的效力、反之、在幼童時代、能給予優越之敎養、則將來定能爲國家服務、爲民族效忠、而得有至爲滿意之結果、古人有謂、「老吾老以及人之老、幼吾幼以及人之幼」、所謂幼吾幼以及人之幼者、蓋爲父母者、應注意於自己之子女的敎養外、并希冀及於一般子女之敎養、本會自成立以來、已有六年之歷史、在此六年中、雖以環境關係、若干方面、尙不能有所成就、但至今確已有相當之成效、本人因他種職務、忙碌之故、未能專力於慈幼事業、幸賴諸同人以及社會人士、熟心慈幼事業之扶導、及努力、而得有今日之成績、在此深表感謝之意、本人極希望社會人士以及諸同人、能本再接再勵之精神、繼續努力、民族之復興、國家之强盛、有賴於此者、實非淺鮮、幸共勉之云、</p>
<p>熊氏演辭　繼熊希齡演說、略謂、本會最近以來、工作之努力而有顯著之進步、造成極良之成績、本人非常欽佩、今日所舉行之大會、各位又能熱烈參加、料慈幼事業之前途、定多光明、本人在此、有二點感想、㈠慈幼事業、在此過渡時期、或有不能明瞭者、或有明瞭而未深切者、前者當爲一般頭腦陳舊、而於慈幼方法、且有表示反對之人、渠等以爲中國在過去、在家庭之敎養、未有所謂新方法、而幼童亦能長大、亦有傑出之人材、後者雖係新時代之人、但於保育幼童、未能予以深切之注意、蓋今日一般受高等敎育之父母、往往因專學某種學問、對於幼童之敎養、無暇加以研究、故祗知將其子女送至托兒所·或幼稚園、即不再顧問、但子女當决無脫離家庭而自存、設家庭而無善良之敎養、則其影響非淺、現在交通事業之發展、各傳染病之易於蔓延、兒童所受刺激之增多、均不可忽視者、以我國目前情形而論、在都市間之家庭、或以爲幼童之享受、當較窮鄕僻壤之處爲佳、但論諸實際情形、亦大謬不然、我人觀乎都市間之家庭、其家庭間之陳設、雖如何精緻、但對於子女之幸福、却全置於不顧、每將子女交付與奶媽或保姆、不再顧問奶媽或保姆之衣住如何糟塌、故其子女每因受奶媽或保姆之影響、而使其子女仍不得健全、故我人必使爲父母者、對於子女之敎育、運用科學化之新方法、㈡關於過去幼童敎養機關、如托兒所·幼稚園·等、對於所收之孩童、完全以學校管理方法辦理、其結果、孩童在功課、固能有相當之進步、而於環境之應付、以及其他各種活動、殊有感於能力之薄弱、本人所辦之香山慈幼院、年來因感於此項缺點、謀以改進、過去每一師保管理孩童、往往達十數人、以致師保之精神不及、孩童頗難得益、現在本院改設一家庭部、每一師保祗管理十個小孩、乃可隨時隨地與以密切接近、此法實行、所得結果、較前善好多多、故本人對於第二點感想、即師保應父母化云、</p>
<p>蔡氏演辭　蔡元培演說、略謂、古人對於敬老慈幼、本極注意、所謂「老則安之、少則懷之」、本會以提倡慈幼爲職志、或以爲慈幼較敬老爲重、或以爲他種關係、姑置勿論、人生約可分爲三個時代、第一爲幼年時代、第二爲壯年時代、第三爲老年時代、老年人已爲社會盡義務有年、可以休養、壯年正在努力社會事業、幼童要希望他將來負責任、文化不進步之民族、祗注意於現在、文化進步之國、則着眼於將來、所謂儲蓄云云、即本此意、要約束現在、犧牲現在、而準備將來、古人說、「一年樹穀、十年樹木、百年樹人」、農人在一年間、本犧牲之精神、而希望年終之收穫、植樹者犧牲十年之時間、而希望十年樹木長成之收穫、樹人亦然、兒童爲將來國家之負責者、故成人之對於幼童、應本犧牲精神、爲其敎養培中華慈幼恊會常會年大會（王開攝）</p>
<p>植、譬如航海中遇險、必先將婦孺先爲營救、成人願居後、此雖有扶弱之意、但亦即重視兒童故也、本人前在奥國時、因奥缺乏牛乳、乃將牛乳支配、先得者爲兒童、有餘然後給予成人、我人觀乎世界之進步、將來的人、其所負之責任、當較現在的人爲更大、換言之、即將來的人、在能力上更應較勝於現在的人、質言之、即今日之兒童、應給予之敎養、較昔日之兒童、應更爲重視、如是則將來的人、方可以負此重任、慈幼之内容、可分爲二、一爲敎、二爲養、敎而不養、則敎亦徒然、故養且較重於敎、我人對於孩童之一切衣食住、應有適當之調節、衛生上尤應重視、幼童時代、因與家庭環境接觸甚密、故爲父母者、應爲子女之完善的表率、古人所謂、「孔子家人不知駡、曾子家人不詈」、蓋孔曾家庭中、凡一言一動、絶無不合道義者、我人舉辦慈幼事業、應提醒一般負敎養小孩者、深切注意及此、我人必當盡力以助之、雖不能直接、亦當間接予以工作上之恊助、則當可有很大之成就、</p>
<p>褚氏演講　褚民誼演說、略謂慈幼事業之重大、人人所應盡力者、人生於世、不應徒自享樂、應想及我身從何而來、則對上應知尊敬祖宗、對下亦應知愛護子孫、我國人向有「不孝有三、無後爲大、」以及以「子孫滿堂、爲莫大幸福者、故中華民族、迄今而達四百兆乃至四百五十兆、現在世界各國、對於人口繁殖之獎勵、均甚注意、譬如一家子女過多、其一部份子女之敎養費、即由政府負担、所以各國人口澎漲、殊爲迅速、我國現在人口雖尙不少、但在質的方面、向極漠視、故有「東亞病夫」之稱、今後欲圖强種强國、必應注意於質的方面、即對於孩童有充分之敎養、本人認爲衛生之注意、體育之提倡、更應努力云、尙有市黨部代表毛雲·市社會局代表陳冷僧·致詞、（詞長從略）</p>

<p>要求之數　相懸甚鉅、曾於十一月十三日致函被告、請其儘是日午後三時之前、加繳一萬九千元、否則惟有將棉麥轉售、如受損失、應由被告負担、但被告依然不理、才於十一月十五日、將該兩種貨物完全轉售、損失一萬四千餘元、照約應令賠償、此皆經過事實、被告當亦不致否認、彼所恃爲理由者、以此項交易、純屬買空賣空、類似賭博、誠屬强詞奪理矣、被告之律師楊凛知繼起答辯、謂對本案事實、無所爭執、僅原告提出賬單、祗列</p>
<p>進貨之價　而無售出之價、故其差額不能承認、然此點尙非被告主要之抗辯、被告所注重者、爲該三紙契約均含賭博性質、實係一種買空賣空之行爲、如㈠約内載明棉麥、皆向美國交易所購買、並受美國法律拘束、顯與通常定貨契約不同、㈡貨價之漲跌、以美國交易所行市爲標準、㈢如此長期之定貨而約内竟不規定起運到達之期間、以及貨品優劣之質地、㈣買主所付、非定銀而爲保證金、㈤貨價如降跌、則須</p>
<p>追加證金　㈥倘追加證金而不給付、即照市價結賬、㈦損失之多寡、亦以市價漲落爲標準、㈧盈虧之計算、槪從美金價格、㈨約内有實際交付貨品之意思一語、倘到期果交貨物何必有此註脚、益顯見係空盤、此語則屬欲蓋彌彰、此外三約中之二、俱爲十二月份到期、其一竟遠至今年三月份到期、而原告之結賬、尙在十一月間、距到期時間甚遙、設被告到期向其取貨、試問如何應付、故原告縱欲結賬、亦應於到期後爲之、今其所追損失、即使非</p>
<p>買空賣空　猶難承認、况確屬買空賣空之賭博行爲乎、此種非法買賣、違反我國强行法規、蓋原告旣非交易所、尤非經紀人、焉能營交易所之業務、我國交易所法第十六條及四十條規定至爲明晰、應請宣告本案所系爭之三紙契約爲無效云云、原告之律師對被告抗辯之理由、即予駁復、以被告指告違反强行法規一節、謂係被告之誤解、並稱與本案性質相同之華洋交易、本市無日不有此種交易、絶不必牽涉交易所法、被告今以虧本、才藉口買空賣空、希圖避免損失賠償責任、惟貿易總有盈虧、若虧蝕即謂係賭博、未免欺人自欺耳、沈推事以本案頗爲複雜、且原告應再補提賣出之貨價清單、遂諭改期續訊、</p>

<h3 id="c185">陳立夫等對於一十宣言意見 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>自十敎授一十宣言發表後、國内學術界領袖及黨政當局表示贊成者甚多、昨日又有中委陳立夫、及湖北民衆敎育學院院長羅廷光、復大校長李登輝、清大敎授鄭振鐸諸氏之意見、茲分誌如下、</p>
<p>陳立夫之意見　中委陳立夫、對一十理言異常注意、近陳氏曾致書友人、略云「中國本位的文化建設、本爲彼一年來繼續努力之主張、以後如有時機、當力促其成爲一種中國之新文化運動」、並聞陳氏現正草一長文、表示其對於中國本位的文化建設之意見云、</p>
<p>羅廷光之意見　湖北民敎學院院長羅廷光、因於今日再度赴歐考察敎育、路過上海、曾對十敎授宣言表示贊成、略謂「文化建設異常重要、此次出洋考察、最注意者、爲歐洲各國文化建設情形、尤其是英國的所謂各　文化的因素、以及大陸各國的民族性、和民族復興的原因、將來苟有心得、當隨時儘量貢獻、以備參考」云云、</p>
<p>李登輝之意見　復大校長李登輝、對此問題、特發表意見云、認眞從事於文化建設、必須審度世界的一般動向、今日世界文化的動向、可說是趨於調和混合、就是將各民族各國家的文化、由於彼此接觸的結果、互相影響、互相修正、互相補充、逐漸產生出含有世界性的新文化、舉一個最具體的例、就是建築、古來西方的建築、已經是由希臘羅馬埃及與北歐的新興民族各種建築混和而成、近來更將中國印度的建築與西方的建築調合起來、成爲最　偉的結構遠非任何一種原有的建築所能比美、建築如此、一切文化亦是如此、我們建設中國的新文化、不應該摭拾别國的唾餘、亦不應該墨守我們自己的成法、必須鑒别西方文化的優點而採納之、辨識我國舊文化的優點而保存之、兩方面集合攏來、再經過鎔冶一爐的工夫、纔能有光輝燦爛的新文化產生、現在我們正立在歧途上、對於人家的和自己的、不知何去何從、有一個時期、我們曾一味崇拜西洋、又有一個時期、又反轉來過分誇張自己、又甚至於棄了自己的精華、拾得人家的糟粕、這都是很危險的、幸而近來國人鑒别的能力、似乎日有進步了、我很希望十敎授的宣言、能引起大家更精細的研究分析、考察比較、總要能够經過選擇淘汰、創造出一種貫串中西的新文化纔好、再說到中國目前的急需、固然大家都很注重物質的建設、關於人民生計、確有趕快設法救濟之必要、這我亦甚贊成、但我覺得精神的建設尤其重要、物質建設如要成功、非有充滿的精神來主持不可、我國人最缺乏的是熱情、因爲没有熱情、就難於團結犧牲、而自私怯懦貪汚諸罪惡、亦就容易發生了、這些都是物質建設的大敵、不將這些大敵剷除、則物質的建設也很容易變成私人自肥的機會、多數人仍不能享到幸福、所以發揚固有道德、以及新生活運動、都可說是精神建設的要圖、不過我個人覺得要激發國人的熱情、宗敎的力量亦該充分應用的、」</p>
<p>鄭振鐸之意見　清華大學敎授鄭振鐸、乘其來滬之便、對一十宣言、亦發抒其贊成之意見、略云「我以爲文化問題固然重要、但中國民族本身如何能生存、却是更大的問題、日本的爪牙永遠抓住中國、中國便永遠没有復興的可能、現在的問題是如何使中國能脫出日本的爪牙、所以最迫切的問題、不是文化的問題、而是生存的問題、我們固然知道、在惡省的環境下、也能生存、但須用如何的方法謀生存、終是大問題、（中略）在中國舊文化裏、是永遠找不到出路、譬如國醫、國衛運動之類、都只是亡國的前一幕的把戲、中國民族的生存必須寄託在新的文化、新的組織上、如何組織民衆、如何使民衆都有自覺的爲生存的爭鬥心、是今日的急務、而恢復舊文化却是死路一條」云、</p>

<h3 id="c201">環境和影響 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>吾們總要避免種種不好的環境，那麽才不致於受到種種不好的影響。但是要避免種種不好的環境，這並不是一件容易的事。吾們聽見墨子說過：「染於蒼則蒼，染於黃則黃。」推想他的用意，不是和「習於善則善，習於惡則惡。」一樣的嗎？由此可以證明吾們的環境的好壞，都在吾們平日做事做得怎樣的了。</p>
<p>倘使吾們處於黑暗齷齪的環境裏，久而久之，未免日趨於下流；換句話說，倘使吾們處於光明高尙的環境裏，久而久之，那自然就聲薰氣染；默默地會起了同化作用了。現在可以拿一件事來證明：</p>
<p>從前戰國時候的孟子，他在幼年時，曾處過不好的環境，當他母親住在墓旁，他就喜歡做墓間築埋······等事。後遷居市旁，他又喜歡做販賣······等事，這是孟子受到不好的環境的緣故，因此受到了不好的影響；所以孟母很是担憂起來，於是决定遷於學宮的旁邊，孟子就成日地設俎豆，習揖讓，日向軌道上走去。這是孟子受到好的環境的緣故，因此受到了好的影響；總而言之，環境的魔力，影響到人們的趨向很利害的。</p>
<p>諸位親愛的小朋友！你們無論如何終要脫離黑暗齷齪的環境，走到光明高尙的環境裏去，那麽就不會受到不好的影響了。</p>
<h3 id="c202">陰陽曆 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>自從西曆紀元前四十六年尤里烏司西帥，制定曆日以後，以一陽來復冬至祭的終日，爲一年的開始，就是今日全世界通行的一月一日。這尤里烏司曆，以冬至月爲一月，可是世俗往往與古的冬至，新年，基督誕生紀念日（十二月二十五日）混而爲一。至於我國所用的舊曆，是起於夏朝的，亦稱爲夏曆，因爲在農業時代，以農事爲重，一年的收穫已畢，依氣節而畫分春冬，若照現行陽曆一月看起來，與農事上的關係，確不相宜。所以日本大部分農村，今日仍用陰曆，雖都會機關，遵行陽曆，也不過當作一個紀元節，是紀念建國的意義。其他在海岸地方，以潮水的漲落，每與陰曆朔望相脗合，也多以陰曆爲便。不過陰曆的日子，計算容易錯誤，就是在小數點下的月齡計算法，各有不同，而且專照月的盈虚而計日，自朔至朔，自望至望，完全用純太陰曆，而不顧及太陽的運行難免在季節上發生差異，所以印度日本參用陰陽曆那可以避免季節的錯誤了。陰曆决定季節的方法，依月的盈虧，定朔望，大月爲三十日，小月二十九日，冬至在十一月，春分在二月，夏至在五月，秋分在八月，閏月置於不含中氣的月，日本從前卽用這法而編曆，自明治五年後，改用陽曆，然而迄今已六十餘年，全國鄕間，仍墨守舊規照陰曆過年的，這是因爲一半爲習俗所拘泥，但亦因季節與農事的關係而不得不然啊。</p>

<p>小朋友們！你們可知道自然界的一切物體，可以分有生命的生物和無生命的非生物兩大類。人，馬，桃，梅等是生物。山，鐵，石，土等是非生物。</p>
<p>生物又可分做植物和動物。人和梅，狗和松，到底誰是動物？誰是植物？很有顯明的區别：</p>
<p>㈠細胞的構造：細胞是構成生物身體的最小單位。包在細胞外面的細胞模，如果是纖維質，是植物。不然，便是動物。</p>
<p>㈡營養的方法：有綠色的葉緣素靠太陽光的光綫。從水和炭酸氣採取營養成分的作用，這是植物。不然，便是動物。總而言之，植物是吸收無機物。動物是吸收有機物。</p>
<p>㈢運動的能力：植物是吸收無機物，隨處都有，所以不須移動軀幹。動物是吸收有機動物，所以必須要去找尋，於是不得不運動了。</p>
<p>㈣感覺的能力：植物是没有神經的，所以碰它一碰，没有顯著的反應力。動物的神經是很靈敏。如果你打了一隻狗，那隻狗一定是很快的逃走了。</p>
<p>植物共有二十三萬三千種以上。可分做兩大類；</p>
<p>㈠顯花植物（開花）：像梅·桃等。</p>
<p>㈡隱花植物（不開花）：像細菌等。</p>
<p>動物可分做十大類：</p>
<p>㈠脊椎動物：人等。㈡節肢動物：蝦等。㈢軟體動物：蚌等。㈣𣗥皮動物：海參等。㈤環形動物；蚯蚓等。㈥圓形動物：蛔蟲等。㈦扁形動物：絛蟲等。㈧腔腸動物：水媳等。㈨海綿動物：海綿等。㈩原生動物：顯微鏡下的小動物</p>

<p>— 乾綽恒久</p>
<p>小朋友！你們在家裏或是在學校裏的時候，總有很多的好朋友吧？我想你一定不願離開你的好朋友的，但是有什麽方法可以使他永遠和你在一起呢？有的！請你看下面的描影游戲吧！</p>
<p>我們先把一張黑色的蠟光紙，用圖釘釘在平的墻上（黑色的一邊朝内），在靠近這墻的地方放一隻坐位，呌你朋友坐在上面，坐位旁的桌上，放一盞燈，使你朋友頭部的影子恰好射到紙上。然後你再用鉛筆將這影子的輪廓鈎好，剪下，將他貼在白紙上（黑色的一邊朝外），那不是你好朋友的一張照像了麽？他不是可以和你永遠住在一起麽？</p>
<p>做這游戲要注意的有四點：㈠你朋友的影子一定要顯出側面的形狀，因爲假使是正面的形狀，就辨不出這是誰了。㈡當你替你朋友鈎輪廓的時候，要請你的朋友不要動，不然會畫壞的。㈢桌上的燈和燈光，都能使他絲毫不動才好。㈣做這游戲最好在夜間，因爲在日間恐怕影子會看不清楚的。</p>
<p>一天，一個樵夫在陷穽中狂呼救命，由行人聽到以後，馬上傳喚幾個人，把伊救起，但是腿上已被藥箭所傷，幸而中傷不重，由獵户各出秘藥把伊救治了。包紥了創傷，問樵夫怎樣會誤墜陷穽的，山的附近不是張貼了警告嗎？</p>
<p>樵夫說：「我只看見了許多紅招貼，但並没有知道你們做下了陷穽坑虎？」</p>
<p>獵户很驚奇的問：「怎麽？紅招貼見到了没有知道有陷穽？難道你不識字嗎？」</p>
<p>「是啊！我是不識字的，所以今天受了傷！」樵夫很慨歎的說。</p>
<p>不朋友！看了上面一段新聞，你感覺到不識字的人痛苦嗎？中國像樵夫一樣的人很多呢！希望你們在校讀書要用功！要認眞！遇到有年長失學的人，趕快勸伊到附近民衆學校去讀書識字！</p>

<p>小朋友！你看了這個題目，或者要奇怪了，螞蟻又有什麽可怕呢？但是，小朋友，請你不要急，讓我來講給你聽吧。</p>
<p>在菲洲地方，有一種螞蟻，它和我們平常看見的螞蟻不同，這種螞蟻有三寸長，力氣非常的大，它們的住所好像是一座寳塔，比人還要高一倍，完全是用泥土很精細的造成的。每當它們出來找尋食物的時候，總有幾千幾萬個，好像是有紀律的軍隊一般。在途中如果遇見了大動物（如獅子，老虎等），也都一齊衝上去，爬到這動物的身上亂咬，直到這動物死了，然後把它分運到寳塔住所裏去。所以菲洲的人們遇見這種螞蟻，都非常的駭怕哩！</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友，你看許多小小的螞蟻，只要有團結的力量，便無論什麽都不怕：我們中國的人口有這麽多，地方又有這樣大，爲什麽連小小的日本都不如呢？小朋友！中國究竟缺乏了些什麽？</p>

<p>— 楊西英</p>
<p>小朋友！我們都知道，天氣冷了是要下雪的，但是你可知道雪究竟是怎樣變成的？這個問題，恐怕小朋友中間知道的很少，現在我把這答案，簡單的寫在下面：</p>
<p>當氣候寒冷的時候，原來大氣中的水蒸氣，遇到了冷，溫度不斷的降低，直降到零度以下時，水蒸氣便慢慢的凝結，成爲固體六角形的結晶細片，從空中降落下來，直到地面，這個東西，我們就呌它做「雪」，它的形狀是各各不同的，肉眼雖然也可以看見，但是糢糊得很，我們倘若拿了顯微鏡去照着細細觀察，可以看見許多不同的形狀，美麗異常。這種天然的美眞可以使我們驚嘆，顏色是無色透明，從結晶的各方面看去，有反射的光綫，所以降了雪後，外面分外的明亮，就是這個緣故。</p>
<p>天神快要降雪了，小朋友！我們大家來觀察一下罷！</p>

<p>— 心青</p>
<p>我睡了多久，却並不知道，到得我醒回來時，那船已去了。我不能遠遠的看見伊張滿了篷駛去，我知道任是竭力的叫喊，也不能使水手們聽得。我想起了我這愁苦之境，便哭了，好多時不知道怎樣纔好。</p>
<p>我這樣的愁苦着，快要發瘋了。心想我要是將貪金之念撇在一旁而不作這回航行，那我此刻不致弄到這步田地。這種思想當然是太遲了，我便自己告知自己，我所應當做的就是要設法出我於愁苦之境。</p>
<p>當下我瞧見了一株樹，一會兒我已高高的坐在那樹枝中間。從我這躱着的所在可以望見一片好景。一面别無所見，只見海和天罷了。</p>
<p>我轉眼向陸地上瞧時，見那去我很遠的所在，我以爲是一個挺大的白球。只爲相去太遠了，不能說是是甚麽東西，於是我從樹上下來跑前去嗎是甚麽。</p>
<p>不多一會，我已接近了這奇怪的東西，能將手放在上邊了。覺得它很光滑。我繞了幾個圈兒，但總想不出是甚麽東西。這大白球周圓在四十碼半以外，而且又是極高的。</p>
<p>我雖如上文所說的繞了幾個圈兒，總也不能想一個法兒走進去。我想：「也許我爬到了頂上，便可得一條路進去了；」但那東西如此的高，又如此的光滑。我總也不能爬將上去。</p>
<p>我立在那裏，那天色立刻黑暗的像夜中一樣了。這原因是爲的一頭大鳥。伊那兩翅竟大得把陽光遮掩了。</p>
<p>於是我知道這鳥定是一頭亞拉伯的大鵬，因爲我曾聽得過這些大鳥的故事的。我所以爲是一個大白球的，便是這大鳥的蛋。伊飛下來坐在蛋上孵着！</p>
<p>我旣　明了伊的計畫，便上去　近了那蛋，坐下去時恰接近那大鳥的一條腿。這腿定也像樹幹一樣粗的。當下我把帶着的一塊布將我自己縛在那腿上。我希望伊第二天飛去時也就把我帶着回去了。</p>
<p>末後夜已盡了，天明時那大鵬便帶着我飛去。我們越升越高，末後便不見了土地。</p>

<p>— 茲</p>
<p>去年年尾，有廣東大羅村的盛張「節婦宴」，今年年頭，有青島市的驅逐「再醮婦」丨丨二十二日本報青島電······以已故黎大總統之妾危文繡，在青與商人王葵軒結婚，有玷黎氏名譽······驅逐出境丨丨封建古氣，迷漫南北，眞「是猗歟盛哉」！</p>
<p>若說青島清潔，留不得再醮婦，然危文繡雖改嫁，仍不失爲清白的中國良民，因寡婦再嫁，民國法律，已承認她爲合法，且過去危爲黎氏妾，妾在法律上，已没有明文承認她的存在，而這次與王某結婚，反是名正言順的。青島彈丸地，容留着不少明搶暗算我們的非中國人丨丨强人，而留不得一個被欺凌的弱女子？丨丨危致友人書中，有：「乃黎公屍骨未寒，旣不能相容於其後人，再不自謀依持，焉能圖存」之句。</p>
<p>世界危機，一天天迫急，有的國家，在男女恊作，内圖建設，外固國防，有的國家，在製造毒瓦斯，細菌彈，死光······預備大屠殺。我們中國，除出一致團結，長期抵抗外，添上獎勵婦女守節，將來可長驅大批烈女，節婦，······一哭敵人退，再哭世界和平。我們預祝封建勝利！節婦神勝利！</p>
<h3 id="c251">髮 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 沉烟</p>
<p>髮在人身上，本是最没有重大効用的，但中國因有句古訓：「身體髮膚，受之父母，不敢毁傷」，所以雖辛亥革命後，令全國人士丨丨只令男子，未及女人丨丨剪去髮辮，確有許多泥古之徒，以拖尾巴爲盡了孝道的。然而剪去後的清潔便利，與夫世界潮流，終於戰勝了古訓。現在的男子，假使仍舊拖一條辮子，上大街小巷去走一轉，誰都會笑他是發了霉的古董了。</p>
<p>剪髮最原始的意義，一時無從查考，但當也不外爲了清潔，便利，現在世界各國的男子，除出印度人還歡喜將它牛屎似地堆在頭頂的以外，恐怕很少有留着這麻煩的東西的了。然而女子却是例外。</p>
<p>女子的盛行剪髮，才最近幾年來的事，歐戰時，歐洲婦女，因參加各種工作，感到梳髻辮髮的麻煩與累贅，很自然地剪了，一時風行全球，不久即傳到了中國，那時正軍閥大捉革命黨，一時曾有斷髮女郎，盡屬革命黨，大行搜索過，辛喜不久革命成功（？）女子剪髮留髮成了個人的自由！</p>
<p>最近蔣委員長下令，禁止軍人不得與無髮髻婦女結婚，這命令實施後，剪髮婦女，確是失去了與軍人結婚的資格，但她只要不散髮，燙髮，仍不失爲一個安分的女公民。</p>
<p>然而據說上海已有幾個婦女團體領袖表示：數年來剪髮的結果，經濟的，時間的，與其他種種方面，較有髮髻時，並無利益，此後將不再剪髮，以恢復髮髻。又據上海各學校女生團體負責人談：各女學生已組織養髮大同盟丨丨節錄本月二十三日中華日報。</p>
<p>這消息是否屬實，不得而知，照例，剪了髮可省了什麽金釵銀簪，是經濟的；不必每晨整理長長的青絲，是省時的；其他便於洗濯，衛生的；男子剪髮，女子也剪髮，平等的，所以自民十六北伐以來，各地婦女除極少數外，都已剪了髮。若說燙髮不經濟，散髮不美觀，盡可不燙，不散‘丨丨共實有閒人的不經濟，不燙髮，她會有别的新發展，至於美觀本不一定標準，丨丨那末恢復髮髻，與養髮大同盟，目的何在呢？是否因中國男兒軍人多，不如此「怕有求偶難」？</p>
<h3 id="c252">駡人和戀愛 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 關露</p>
<p>中國有一種最普遍的駡人的話，卽一開口便是「他媽的」什麽什麽：「他媽的」這只是駡人中最普遍而順嘴的一種，自然和這相似的駡法很多，而且按照南北的方言不同，其用的字眼也各異，但是我們可以用一個系統來歸納：卽是中國的一種最習慣的駡人方法，是以「性」作對象的。</p>
<p>以「性」作爲駡人對象的這種習慣，大槪不僅是限於中國，在外國也曾有的，　俄國小說就可以在許多對話中發現丨當然其他的國家是少有的丨但是這種駡人的方法，最流行，應用得最純熟，最普遍的怕要算是中國了。我們不管跑到南北東西，鄕村城鎭，遇着無論是兩夫婦，兩兄弟，乃至於是兩父子，當他們破口相駡的時候，大槪總是在些什麽「他媽的」，「狗×的」，「噪你······等等的當中選擇一種或數種，作爲駡得最得意，最澈底，而且也最痛快，心胸一澈的妙語！總之，只要是以性作對象，作爲駡人的武器的話，不管是母親，姊妹；六親，九族；祖宗，八代，都可以一股兒拉進去，用來侮辱對方。</p>
<p>爲什麽這種習俗在中國這樣盛行呢？自然，這種用「性」關係來駡人的意識，就是蔑視女性的意識；封建勢力愈强烈的社會，蔑視女性的意識也就愈濃厚。</p>
<p>本來，在封建制度中，女性底一切都是處於附屬的地位，對於男女底關係，女性也是絶對附屬的，被動的。封建制度封鎖了女性的一切自由，卽使是天然生理的性生活，女性也不得自由。男人可以自由尋找老婆，女人如果自動地去找了男人，這便要被認爲「奇恥大辱」，「傷風敗俗」的事體。男人一生可以結幾次婚，接近幾個女人，女人是要從一而終，是要有貞操的美德，假如一個女人和兩個以上的男人發生了關係，這是恥辱，是失了身份，是損失。總之一個女人除開了由於父母之命所指定的那一次的結婚以外，對於男女關係是應該退避三舍，應該抱絶對消極的態度。否則便是淫蕩的女人。</p>
<p>封建社會對於男女關係，在女性身上有了這樣一個金科玉律，刻於經典的規定，那麽，如果一個男人要存心侮辱女人的話，便可以從「性」上去侮辱；謾駡和中傷，也可以從「性」上面去發展。所以在駡人的時候，如對方是女性的話，可以直接侮辱她自己：如果對方是男的，便可以從他的母親，姊妹，九眷，六親！陰性的！開始。</p>
<p>這種駡人的習俗，可以說一方面是根據了某種社會的男女觀念而來的，同時，也由於這種習慣，可以表現出某一種社會中的男觀念。當然，一種習慣的殘餘，卽在那種社會的整個意識改變了以後，還不是可以卽刻肅清的。但是，這種駡人的習慣，在目前中國的一般習慣中並不是殘餘，而是非常地盛行着，非常地在「膾炙人口」。</p>
<p>現在可以說，歷來的中國封建社會對於女性的觀念，附屬在這種駡人的藝術形式上，建築得十分穩固的「二十四橋」上，從封建君主時代輕輕地渡到現在了。</p>
<p>我們且看現代社會中的中國的男女關係，從「性」底出發點上，現社會對於女性抱了怎麽樣的態度，然後就會知道這種以「性」作對象的駡人，絶非偶然的事體。同時，從這一點上，也就很親密地使我們連繫到這最現實而和我們最關切的所謂「婚姻」和「戀愛」的問題了。</p>
<p>頭腦進步一點的人，都懂得「婚姻」是要自主的，「戀愛」是要自由的。但是由開始戀愛達到結婚的這個過程中，在藝術和技術上，大槪都是應該由於男性去主動。男人想和一個女人講戀愛是自由的，男的向女的求婚也是自由的；但是如果由一個女的去主動的向男人講戀愛，優先地表示了她愛他。這是很不技術也是不藝術的，大槪對方一定會因此輕視她，拒絶她而她遭遇失敗。卽使這個女人不遭對方的拒絶，在第三者看起來，似乎這女人也有些不很「體面」！還有：男人進攻一個女人，碰了釘子，還可以向人表演；假如女人向男人表示愛戀而遭了唾棄，這對於女人眞是「奇恥大辱」！</p>
<p>根據上面的許多事實，現在的社會雖然不像封建時代，用了明文大典把女性規定在「三從」的禮敎下面：不把女性看成應該是「從一而終」，是丈夫的侍者；但是在「婚姻自主」和「戀愛自由」的口號下，女性獲得了些什麽？「性」關係對於女性是秘密的，消極的，只是義務而無權利的。戀愛的自由，女人只有受動的自由，而無主動的自由。經過了一次離婚的女人，和人談戀愛時竟有會使對方覺得費考慮的這樣的事體，當然這都是證明了在目前中國社會中的封建意識的健在了！</p>
<p>我的意思，自然不是預備做這樣的一種婦女工作：團結和發動許多年青的女人，去向男人們進攻，包圍，大開戀愛講習所。我的意思是：只要不是「父母之命」，「媒妁之言」，婚姻是相願的，戀愛也是相願的，而不是一相情願的事體。在男女關係上不要有主動和被動的劃分，不要有主從的規定，要取消女性的附屬地位。</p>
<p>「他媽的」駡人的風俗，和以女性作犧牲的舊有的男女關係，是一條火蛇，是被一條鐵練子鎖着的；如果覺得「他媽的」這句話聽不順耳的時候，當然這種舊有的男女關係也是看不順眼的。總之「他媽的」駡人藝術，對於女性的戀愛多少是帶着一點危險性的！</p>

<h3 id="c253">「社會人」自述 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 社英</p>
<p>個人從事社會之經過，實由辛亥革命時開始，而所參加之社會生活，大槪可分兩種性質，即一爲從事新聞事業，一爲參加婦女運動是也。至學校敎讀生活，比較時期爲短，先後僅僅三五載耳。</p>
<p>新聞事業時期</p>
<p>憶自辛亥革命，一時女界踴躍參加，當時婦女團體，正如雨後春筍，蓬勃而起，請願北伐者有之。恊助軍餉者有之。彼時記者少年熱血，恨不立見革命成功，於是奮勇參加活動，蓋其時一般女子之志願，完全在努力革命，爲國家民族謀福利，猶非若嗣後爲爭平等之婦女運動也。時家君與于右任宋　初諸先生，以民立報爲製造空氣宣傳思想之革命機關。於時記者任編輯副刋，是爲參加新聞記者生活之始。厥后幾盡以新聞記者爲職業，就中以從事中華新報之時間最久，初編文藝副刋，嗣主婦女與家庭欄，前後約有七八載之歷史也。</p>
<p>參加婦運槪况</p>
<p>個人從事社會生活，由辛亥革命而后，最先參加者，爲神州女界恊濟社。曾負責編有神州女報月刋。民元五團體合併改組國民黨第一次開成立大會於滬上靜安寺路之張園，當時記者曾擔任紀錄。是日紀錄者四人，男女性各二。其一爲民權報記者某君。一爲民立報記者徐血兒。一爲吳江楊季威。一則記者也。事隔二十年。某君現負黨國重任。徐君已死。楊君多病。記者則故我依然。四人各異其境，亦可見人事變遷矣。五四之役，參加滬上愛國運動。十一年秋，與同志發起上海女權運動同盟會，響應北平女權會。十四年春，聯合滬杭婦運同志，組織中國婦女恊會，並主編有特刋。蓋以國際地位，關係重要，國際間不得不有聯絡之機關，故成立之初，即加入國際婦女恊會，以通世界婦運之聲氣，而博國際間之同情。十六年春，革命軍初蒞上海，遂爲東前政治部組織上海婦女運動委員會之宣傳機關，同時並出版　婦女運動旬刋，以促婦女認識革命與婦運之意識。夏秋間，復因謀集中婦運力量與意志起見，與同人組織上海婦女團體統一會，至僅僅參加並無所貢獻於社會者，猶有婦女恊會，中華女子參政會，以及婦女提倡國貨等運動，曁某某婦女團體等，旣無特别之成績，更不足述矣。十八年春。因鑒於婦運之渙散，非有宣傳機關以爲喉舌不可，乃與同志共同組婦女共鳴社，發刋婦女共鳴。初爲关月刋，二十一年改爲月刋，幸同人之努力，已有其六周年之歷史，亦云幸矣。最近參加之南東婦女文化促進會，又爲謀婦女文化運動者也。總之，二十年來之生活，均不脫此類社曾會生活之範圍，誠以新聞記者與社會運動，有相互連繫之關係，蓋新聞紙存製造輿論，轉移社會之權威，即如辛亥或命之易於推翻政體，改造共和，何者莫非輿論之力。原一時國人思想，由新聞紙之灌輸，極富民族觀念，人心思漢，故有人振臂一呼，風起雲湧，響應不遑矣！而婦女初求解放，觸處受人壓迫，新聞紙雖號稱促進社會之利器，然每未能抛除舊習，　眞正男女平等之觀念，於婦女運動消息，殊不甚加以注意，多一人側身其間，即多佔一地位，不特於宣傳方面，可較便利，而言論方面，亦可多所糾正，最低限度，總可少去若干輕忽口吻，譏諷諭調矣。</p>
<p>社會生活感想</p>
<p>總計參加社會工作之經過，個人感有趣味而比較有悠久成績者，厥維婦女共鳴社。且由此社之經騐，愈覺從事社會運動，非僅恃名義上之合羣團結，即可認爲健全團體，以爲能增加某種力量。未知彼人數衆多，若毫不努力，或未能蠲除意見，實行合作者，則往往非爭權奪利，即互相推諉，轉致一事莫舉，無形停頓。而共鳴乃與三數意見相合之同志所發起，彼此多能視社事如己事，推誠相予，旣無所謂競爭權利，又無所謂諉避責任，是以能有六年來之歷史，否則即以婦女團體而言，彼經濟充裕，人材衆多之團體多矣。何以倐起倐滅，不能持久，推誠之關係，不亦大哉？寄語社會運動之同志，倘能以誠相見，殆天下無不可爲之事也。個人感想大致如此，即以上述之希望，結束自述。</p>
<h3 id="c254">慈幼敎養院訪問記 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>本埠塘山路慈幼敎養院，係由中華慈幼恊會所主辦，成立迄今，已將五載。日前，記者爲明瞭該院近狀計，曾一度往訪。</p>
<p>主任劉瑾芳女士，年紀約三十五六歲，態度和藹可親。歸納她的答覆，大體是這樣：該院組織分總務敎務訓育衛生四部。内設主任一人，敎職員六人，保姆男女工役三人。</p>
<p>經費方面，每年約需一萬元左右，全持主辦機關設法捐集。</p>
<p>全院院生，現有九十餘人，内男生佔十分之五强。他們的來歷，大都由本市公安局，社會局，地方法院，救濟會等機關送交留養。就中時有被人領養，或遣送回籍，所以每月都平均有十五人左右的出入。</p>
<p>敎導方面，院内附設小學一所，學制與普學制相同，因限於「經濟」「人才」和「塲所」等關係，暫時均採複式編製，分六級三班。敎學的方法，中高年級採用自學輔導法，低年級則採用設計敎育法。至課外的實習，女生以縫紉，造鞋，織襪，理家事等爲主，男生則以開闢農塲，清潔工作，合作社等爲主。</p>
<p>院生住院年限，照規定是至十二歲爲止，但如有智力較高的院生，院方爲使其繼續修完六年的學業起見，也可特别通融，延遲至十六歲。未成年的院生，至一定年限後，或則讓人家領養去，或則由院方介紹至各工廠商店充當學徒。成年的女院生，院方必要時，得爲她擇配。其辦法不收聘禮，但求婚者須備洋一百元，作給該生置辦奩具之用。求婚者的資格如下：㈠無配偶，㈡身家清白品行端正，㈢有正當職業曾受相當敎育，㈣有二人之介紹。</p>
<p>出院後的院生，院方訂有聯絡辦法。凡欲領養該院小孩的，須隨時接受院方的指導，逢院方派人訪問時，不能拒絶。院生的日常成績，也須於每學期終了時，報告院方，以便考查。　　訓育方面，大槪亦與普通學校相同。不過，這裏的院生，院門是不能隨便走出的，因此除了山敎師伴同出外參觀的機會外，平時是没有的。</p>
<p>談話到這裏止，便告了段落。這時適由外面走來了一位穿藍布長衫的男人，承陳主任的介紹，他正是該院的敎員李君。於是，得機記地便要求李君伴往各室參觀，這要求，毫無躊躇的，立刻得到了同意。</p>
<p>敎室就在二樓，一共是三個。每個敎室，都正在上課。學生們都穿了齊整的藍竹布制服，愉悅地用心地在聽講，記者因爲不忍攪亂他們的注意力，所以在各敎室中，只站了片刻，便走了出來。在高年級的敎室中，有一條「苦幹。我們才有出路」的標語。當時，確十二分者感動了記者，眞的，這年頭，窮小子除了苦幹，還能怎樣呢？</p>
<p>男生的寢室，就在沿窗的地方。「整潔」兩字是很够得上的。矮小的鐵床，一排一排地陳列着，床上呢，白色的褥單藍色的棉花被，都鋪放得很齊整的。女生的寢室，是在三樓，因李君不慣便用鑰匙，所以没有走得進去，只立在一隻高凳上遙望了一下，情景和男生寢室差不多。</p>
<p>此外，我們又參觀了學生們主持着的市政列，壁報，市民銀行！！提到市民銀行，也許有人會懷疑，「孤兒們怎來的錢呢」？其實，也不盡然，據李君的解說，院方爲鼓勵高年級學生的工作興趣，做了生產工作後，是個個人可得工錢的。這些工錢。就給存放在這個小銀行中，日後院生出院，便一併發還。</p>
<p>院方關於醫藥的設備，一般的講，是還够應用的。只是，那個診察的地方，光綫實在太暗淡些。</p>
<p>走回辦公室，陳主任正在整理兒童的簿籍。這主任的精神，是値得佩服的，記者一時眞不禁洋洋地爲孤兒們慶幸起來。雖然嚴格的講，這種敎養院的設置，也不過是一種改良主義的皮表救濟工作，但孤兒畢竟是可憐的，目下政府旣無力顧及，那末，多少總聊勝於無吧。</p>
<p>最後，記者爲提供研究社會學者的參考起見，又重復問了一問院生進院的詳細原因，承陳主任給我　了一個新近的統計表。自十九年三月至二十三年九月止，這中間所收容的院生來歷是：災童一五三人，赤貧五○人，被賣九人，被虐二○人，被拐一五人，迷路三五人，遺棄二○人。</p>
<p>讀者們，從前面這些數目字中，中國社會的病徵，光景已可推想而知，你們將作何感想？</p>
<h3 id="c255">婦女與文學（續） <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 錢子衿</p>
<p>寫出寄生生活的可憐，喚起婦女人格獨立的自覺。易卜生在娜拉一劇中描寫女主人公娜拉因發覺她丈夫平日對她的溫柔，甜蜜，與熱愛，全是虚僞，都係假意，一旦有了與他名譽有損的事情發生，他便全露了本心，痛駡妻子帶累了自己。然而待事情解决後，他却又故裝大量，寬容。於是娜拉從此便完全「明白了」，認識了自己只和一個陌生人同住在一起，替他生了三個孩子。她决心從此出走，打算去敎育自己，去做一個「人」。娜拉說：「總之，我是一個人」。</p>
<p>娜拉爲要求獨立生活，要求做一個人，决然丢棄了以往的一切，丈夫與孩子而離家。這是暗示着婦女人格獨立，做一個眞正的自己的「人」，比甚麽都重要。</p>
<p>「娜拉的獨立宣言（Ｄeclaration　of　lmdependence）發表後，對當時的社會人心，確實投擲了非常的刺激，掀起了極大的波浪。戈斯曾說：「這篇作品闡　了人性的内面。看劇的人們，都爭相倣傚劇中人的口吻。········實際，凡是看了這幕劇的人，没有一個不在家庭裏談論，辯論得激烈的時候，甚至因此破壞了家庭的和平。</p>
<p>自從娜拉出世後，一部分婦女便從迷夢中驚醒，從地下抬頭，從暗中伸手。赤手空拳打出了幽靈塔，去找尋自己的途程了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>但是娜拉離家以後怎樣呢？就是婦女覺醒以後怎麽樣呢？這以後的婦女就是蕭伯納所著的華倫夫人之職業（一八九三年出版）中，由娜拉的精神所鍛鍊成功的一個新型的經濟獨立的女子薇薇。</p>
<p>婦女若要從附屬的寄生的奴隸生活解放出來，要求人格的獨立，那麽非先有經濟的獨立不可。薇薇就是離家以後，從家庭到了社會的娜拉。她是代表新型的以自己的能力換取社會報酬，來過獨立生活的女子。薇薇變成了世界的人，社會的人，而不是家庭丈夫的奴隸或玩物了。</p>
<p>金錢，地位，克勞夫公爵夫人以及華倫夫人所放給她的舊時代的一切，薇薇都表示反對，拒絶。她在劍橋大學受過高等敎育，精於數學。她替一位女律師計算賬目。每天六小時工作完畢後，散步運動。她完全靠自己的頭腦與兩手生活，絲毫不依賴别人。</p>
<p>薇薇拒絶了華倫夫人要她敷衍的富翁克勞夫公爵，又嘲笑了一般浮薄青年的「愛的稚夢」。她向她母親喊叫：「人人都有選擇職業的自由。世上頂苦的孩子，雖然不能選擇做英國的王后，牛津的校長，但是他却可以隨着自己的嗜好，選擇還是檢破布，還是賣花。········」</p>
<p>這樣去創造自己的生活，獨立自存的女子，就是易卜生以後的新女子的典型。也就是離家以後的娜拉的正當的歸途。具有新生活的理想，抱着堅毅的决心，去和社會奮鬥，與華倫夫人一類的舊型的長不相反抗。踢開男性用偏見與自私所築成的壁壘，她們走入了一向爲女子絶足不登的辦公室，寫字台，工廠，商塲，研究室，實騐室，學校，官署。</p>
<p>霍普脫曼的小說工女馬的台，女主人翁馬的台，也就是新型婦女的一位代表。貧窮苦惱，强固了她對生活鬥爭的决心。她叩開了一個工塲的大門，離在一大羣工人中做一個最辛苦的女工。生活的荆𣗥刺傷了她的手足，她並不覺�痛苦。運命投擲了各種嘲弄，可是她的鐵一般的顏面，没有一絲抖儃與恐怖。她誇耀着自己所有的一種力量丨丨全不依賴别人而獨自生活的力量。</p>
<p>在那格羅特斯加亞的小說酒神之憤怒中女主人公塔尼亞是一位出身於豪富之家的女藝術家。她和一位熱心科學的青年司太克戀愛了。他們經過了法律手續實行同居。但她與她的丈夫各有着自己的天地。各自做着各自的工作。有時塔尼亞置身於「戀愛」與「工作」的衝突中了。但她總是以對工作的熱意來撲滅了戀愛的火熖。她先做她藝術的工作。在熱戀期間，她的日記傳上還寫着對工作熱切愛着的字句：「今天作了工作。這是狂熱一般的工作，從早晨起覺得一刻也不能將工作放手」。</p>
<p>柯倫泰的赤戀中的瓦斯利莎是一位革命家，同時又是現代標本的女性。她愛她的工作，深刻而熱烈。丨丨特别是組織公共住宅的工作。丨丨她雖也戀愛，然而戀愛幻滅時丨丨即使在熱戀中丨丨即也不忘却自己的工作。在工作上絲毫不受戀愛的牽制。最値得注意的是在她失戀後所取的那種平靜的態度。因爲在她面前堆積着無窮盡的工作，待她去做。</p>
<p>這里，表示着舊日所特别重視的「戀愛，」已經不是婦女生活的唯一的内容，而和男子同爲「戀愛」是第二義的事項。「戀愛神聖。到了這時，却爲女性所冷淡，不爲她們視爲至寳。而「事業」是她們第一義的事情了！</p>
<p>還有樸泰木考的小說霧中的，女主人公樊拉，妮考台莫維娜，格萊德·瑪賽爾海司的小說聲中的瑪耶，依爾賽·弗拉旁的小說勞働裏面的女主人公郁賽弗，高爾基的小說漂泊者的日記中的大那娜，都是典型的新女性，</p>
<p>易卜生以後的現在，已經有了幾千萬的職業婦女在自食其力，幾千萬的婦女埋首於自己的事業了。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>從詩經樂府西廂紅樓夢聖經，和屠格湼夫柴霍甫左拉莫泊桑，托爾斯泰的小說中，我們看到了被動，獻身，幽雅，溫柔，嬌弱可憐的不少奴化了的女性。但經過了易卜生時代的那位暴動革命的叛徒娜拉之後便產生了覺醒了的薇薇馬的苔，塔尼亞，瓦斯利莎等新型的婦女。　　未來的婦女如何：這尙少偉大的文學家出來啓示，出來舉烽火，擊警鐘，但是我們就現在加以推測，不難想像得出來。未來的婦女，一定是在質量雙方的進步發展。她們較薇薇馬的苔，塔尼亞，瓦斯利沙當更進步，而且數量上，新型婦女，將更增多。新型婦女將不是特殊的少數所形成的一羣，而是婦女全體。在將來，薇薇塔尼亞馬的台等將不成其爲新型，而是普遍的一般的必然的現象。每一處窮鄕僻境，每一處世界的角隅，將都充滿了自覺了的更進步了的薇薇，馬的台，塔尼亞，瓦斯利沙。</p>
<p>而且，她們將不如婦女革命時代一樣有着那種無政府狀態的貪婪的多方面的要求。她們將盡量地發揮自己優異的本能。因爲人類眞正的文化是要求男女盡量地發揮固有的優異本能的。所以我相信未來的婦女是在和男子絶對的平等待遇之下，做着普通的一般工作之外，更發揮她們優異的本能，做一點特殊的事業。這事業是社會所需要而男子所不能做成，或做不好的。</p>
<p>姊妹們，努力吧！光明在前邊，（完）</p>

<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>中華民國第二十二個雙十節，觀音戲出世之後，播演到如今已有十五個月的歷史。在上海各播音臺上的話劇團體，據說此時已有三十九個之多。古人說得好，「前人種樹，後人乘凉。」我是首先種樹的人，當然喜歡看見許多無綫電戲劇藝術的追求者都到我樹下來乘凉。但是，不幸得很，乘凉者雖是日見其多，而有志於無綫電戲劇藝術之追求者尙屬寥寥。這已經足够使我難受的了。尤其不堪的就是常常聽得坐在樹蔭下的人們爲樹蔭不敷應用而互相譏諷排擠，甚至於連種樹人都要被擠出樹蔭之外去！你說可憐不可憐？</p>
<p>「觀音戲」就是「無綫電戲劇」（Ｒadiodrama）的别名。無綫電戲劇在歐美各國雖已盛行，但尙未離搖籃時代。據許多藝術批評者說，這位小妹妹的前途未可限量，將來長大成人之後，或許能做出她的姊妹們所夢想不到的偉大事業。她不像她的姊姊丨丨戲劇丨丨要受到空間與時間的限制，她可以在任何一個電臺，任何一個季節，散播她的藝術種子到全世界去丨丨也許是全宇宙去。全人類的藝術化只有這位小妹妹一個人可以做得到吧？</p>
<p>我給無綫電戲劇題這「觀音戲」的别號，無非是要讓人家容易注意而且容易記憶。是中國人，没有一個不聽見過「觀音」二字的。但「觀音」兩字到底是甚麽意思？只怕有許多大和尙還不能痛痛快快乾乾脆脆地對答出來。我從小就對於「觀音」兩字感到異常的興趣。數年前被我發現了英國廣播劇社的無綫電戲劇，我便覺得「音」可以「觀」祇有在無綫電戲劇的中間。</p>
<p>但是，因爲我們的戲呌做「觀音戲」，就有許多基督徒和其他敎徒因避叛敎的嫌疑，至今尙有未敢收聽的呢！還有一個笑話，就是常常有遊方僧見了我們「上海觀音劇社」的招牌，誤認我們是佛敎徒，向我們來募化修建破廟的經費。</p>
<p>無綫電戲劇的劇本比無臺戲更難編製。在歐美雖也出了不少投機的書籍，但能切合實用的却還不易多得。最難的一點就在無綫電戲劇不能借助於服裝。佈景，光影，化裝等而把劇中人的環境與個性等透露出一部分來。而且因爲聽衆永遠見不到劇中人，所以每一個塲面的劇中人不能像舞臺劇那樣的多，多了就不易辨認。而且每一個演員的上塲與下塲必須由劇中人對白中很自然的吐露出來。劇中人的所在地及季節，氣候等等有助於劇情之進展者最好亦在對白中用最藝術的方法洩露出來。除對白外，只有配音一種方法可以增厚劇情的濃度。純正的無綫電劇本不需要第三者口吻的報告。莎士比亞的劇本就是無綫電戲劇較好的範本，因爲時與地與人的互相關係無一不由對白中吐露出來；但並非最好的範本，因爲莎劇雖無佈景，但尙有賴於視覺，而無綫電戲劇差不多是演給瞎子看的，猶之乎啞劇與默片是演給聾子聽的。</p>
<p>我聽見上海有幾個文明戲化的話劇團體至今尙用文明戲開幕閉幕的警笛。這種刺激性過大的尖音最不適於無綫電之用。旣已無幕可閉，旣已不受空間的限制，前後兩幕連貫的戲儘可讓劇中人由花園慢步進臥室去，何苦要吹兩次警笛，要添許多盲腸式的報告呢？</p>
<p>我們的配音方法雖經幾位同志苦心搜索得來，但從來不敢自秘。機關槍是鐵棍敲桌邊。步槍是籐鞭抽木板。大砲與炸彈是全臂彈鋼琴的低音方面。飛機聲是一捲舊報紙輕觸電扇兩翼。其餘多半是區區一點口技。</p>
<p>還有一件是雨聲。我們是把一粒粒的乾黃荳用一根根的短綫繫在一把芭蕉扇上。輕輕擺動便成大小各種的雨聲。這裏有一個笑話。我們的配音技師常把這件法寳寄存在各電臺。及至臨塲取用，黃荳已全果鼠輩之腹。此後擬改用料珠。</p>

<h3 id="c257">估衣業 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 許嘯</p>
<p>估衣店的營業在整個的商業和社會的經濟上說起來，牠的確是佔着很重要的地位。假如市面上没有當店的設立，那麽這一個地方的小市民層的經濟，必然會受到很大的影響；但是僅祗有了當店，而没有估衣業，那當店許多過期的抵押品就没有銷路了。所以估衣業和當店，對於一個市面的經濟繁榮，却是互爲因果，相底於成的在整個的商業上佔有了極重要的地位。不過，估衣業到底總是一種畸形的商業；在牠那裏賣出去的衣服，總一律都是舊的，卽使有的衣服實際上並不舊，但估衣店自己也還是要說是舊的。這在　　　　　　　　　，牠是恰恰用着與人相反的營業方式。</p>
<p>在上海的石路一帶，像這種估衣店總不下三十多家。另外還有十幾家「提莊」也設在這一帶。一些歡喜穿便宜衣服的人，没有不知道這條估衣業大本營似的石路的，同時，也可說是當店的一部份抵押品的棧房。所以當店若没有估衣業，他們的抵押品就無法推銷：但估衣店若没有當店，他們便缺乏貨物的來源。不過，在他們這種互相利用的原則上，吃虧的還是估衣業；因爲估衣店所收進的衣服，中間却還要經過「提莊」的一道關。</p>
<p>他們的交易的形式，是先由當舖把滿期的衣服，一包一包地包好放在一起：不問裏面是長衫或旗袍，也不管裏面衣服的新舊；大的，小的，摩登的，　式的，皮的，　　，布的，各種奇奇怪怪的衣服　　　這樣無數的包裹。「提莊」假如要買的話，是可任憑打開來　　；但最多不能超過三十包以上，這是他們互相遵守的規則。貨看好了以後，才把這貨的估本統統加起來，末了再打個七折或七五，七三，不同的折扣。「提莊」把這許多衣服買進之後，再把牠們一樣樣的分類起來；這時就全靠「呌貨」的眼力，把這許多衣服都要評定一種很適當的價格。</p>
<p>說起這種「呌貨」的職務，的確不是一件容易幹的工作；别的都說不上高明，但把一包衣服送到他的面前，他祗要一看就可斷定這件衣服是　家的出品，是仇貨抑是國貨；衣服的新舊成份，値價的多少，都在他那一轉眼之間就决定了衣服的身價。</p>
<p>像這種「呌貨」的人材，每家「提莊」總有兩個，範圍大的也有用到四人的；「提莊」對這種職員的待遇，總　　比一般的職員來得優異。他們從早到晚，假如不要到提莊裏來吃飯的話，就很少有時間登在莊裏；他們大部份的時間，都是花在談天上面，不是坐在那家綢緞局就是坐到那家皮貨莊上；他一面和這裏的人閒談，一面暗暗的留心記着這裏的貨價，有時也會跑到各種衣料廠裏去參觀。担任這種職務的人，不僅要有那副天才，並且對於上海商業上各方面的人物都得熟悉；不然，你就祗有「黑漆門樓」，一步也走不通的。</p>
<p>「提莊」對於各種衣服的定價，都是由「呌貨」的執行；他把各種衣服劃定各種不同的碼子，每一百兩銀子的碼子打成七折，再轉賣給估衣商人。</p>
<p>估衣店裏也都雇有專門買貨的職員，他們的眼光也並不遜於「提莊」的「呌貨」　不過他們　　的</p>

<p>中國人未老先衰，尤歡喜倚老賣老。但我所見的賣老，以魯迅「風波」中的「九斤太太」爲最出色：九斤太太正拿了破芭蕉，敲着凳脚，大怒道：「我活到七十九歲了，活够了，不願眼見這些敗家相！！還是死的好丨······」</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>目標各有不同。他們所歡迎的衣服，大都是舊式的長大的中式衣服；西裝當然也要，但總不很歡迎，因爲這類的主顧是不很容易上門的。至於女旗袍，那更是使他們見了頭痛，這種衣服比西裝還要不容易脫手。</p>
<p>在這社會經濟不景氣的現狀下，有許多穿西裝的人，大都限於經濟環境關係，因陋就簡，所以一套比較像樣的西裝，倒不愁没有主顧。但女旗袍却有點兩樣；因爲這種衣服的裁製大都和男人的西裝一樣的是照身體的肥瘦製成的，但是要改變起來却又比西裝還要困難。而且一般時髦婦女，她们根本就不會願意穿别人的「舊貨」；鄕下的婦女，她們也許還没有學會穿旗袍，縱然例外的會有鄕下的主顧來買，却又往往因了身段的大小不合，十件交易中間難得有一件是成功的·因此估衣店看到買進了女人的旗袍，總是把這件衣服的價値，分加在别的衣服上面；如果這件女旗袍幸而脫售了，那是「外快」，卽不然，他也就不至於賠本了。</p>
<p>估衣店和「提莊」的交易，有的是一面取貨，一面付錢。如果這家估衣店是有了相當歷史，或是平素呑吐力較强的，那是可以先把貨拿去，到月底月中再結算一次；不過普通的總是先付三成，其餘的多半是陸續清付。</p>
<p>這班估衣店，他們把貨買來再賣出去，在這一轉手之間·所得利益最多不過二分；不過，有時有了新貨賣出去，對本利也很容易。他們對於衣服上的標價，大槪都用一種暗碼標成銀子數目；每兩銀子合洋錢大約是六角左右。例如一件衣服的碼子是標成十兩，實際上並不到六元，但是他們賣出去總在六元之間。</p>
<p>估衣業營業最壞的時期是春夏兩季；在這兩季裏面，儘管老板和伙計喊破了喉嚨，也還是不會有主顧上門。像這樣的局面一直要維持到九月以後，營業就慢慢地鼎盛起來了；等到到了朔風怒號的冬天，那主顧就像雨後春筍般的走進門來，出去一個又補上一個。尤其在這時所賣出的衣服，大都是獲利非常的豐厚；因爲冬天的衣服大槪是皮貨居多，就是一般勞働階級至少也會買件把棉袍子。這一個時期可以說是估衣業的黃金時代；估衣店的本身營業增加了，那伙計們的幸運也就同時跟着來了。</p>
<p>在估衣業中，對於僱用職員，大都取佣金制的；大槪規定每元三分，有的或者還不止此數。但就一般的情形來說，是不會多到什麽地步的；不過呌貨的職員，除每元收取佣金三分之外，每售出一件衣服還可多得一分。大槪一個呌貨的每月收入，平均總在二三十元之間，最多不會超過四十元；另外的希望就是年終的紅利了。這種　紅利的支配方法，各家都不盡相同，有的提出百分之十，或者百分之二十，但也有完全不分紅利的，這都全視老板個人的意志爲轉移的。</p>
<p>估衣店的學徒，不但不能和普通商店的學徒一樣，每月可向店裏拿一元或兩元的剃頭，洗澡，洗衣服的雜費；而且在三年學徒期内的膳宿各費反而是要算還給老板的，這在一般商業的情形看起來，也不能不算是一種畸形的狀態吧？</p>

<h3 id="c259">日貨傾銷問題 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 可生</p>
<p>自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌發生以來，不景氣的狂流卽以最大的力量，掃蕩着世界各帝國主義國家的繁榮。這情形，首先從對外貿易上表現了出來。我們看：</p>
<p>一九三一年　　一九三三年</p>
<p>英國輸出　四億五千四百萬鎊　四億一千六百萬鎊輸入　　　八億六千百萬鎊　　六億七千八百萬鎊</p>
<p>美國輸出　二十四億二千四百萬圓　十六億七千四百萬圓輸入　　　二十億九千百萬圓　　　十四億四千八百萬圓</p>
<p>法國輸出　三百四億二千萬法郎　　百八十四億三千萬法郎輸入　　　四百二十一億九千萬法郎二百八十四億二千萬法郎</p>
<p>德國輸出　九十五億九千萬馬克　　四十八億七千萬馬克輸入　　　六十七億二千萬馬克　　四十二億馬克</p>
<p>這些都是世界的主要國家。由上表看來，它們在一九三三年的對外貿易的數目字，比較起一九三一年的都大大地减少了，卽是說它們的對外貿易是在日益衰落中。</p>
<p>但在世界各國的對外貿易日益衰落的情形之下，日本却成爲了例外：一九三三年，日本的貿易總額是三十七億四千萬日圓，其中輸出佔十八億三千萬元，輸入佔十九億一千萬元，這若與一九三二年的相較，則在輸出入上是共增加了百分之三十三；若再與一九三一年比較，則是輪出增加了百分之六十，輸入也增加了百分之五十五。及至一九三四年上期，日本的輸出便達到了十億三百萬日元，輸入也達到十一億五千八百萬元，與一九三三年的同期比較起來，則其輸出又增加了百分之二十，輸入亦增加了百分之十四。</p>
<p>在全世界的不景氣的狂流中，日本對外貿易之獨能向上發　，當然是由於日本商品在世界市場上之進出，卽是由於日貨的傾銷。事實上　所有世界的重要市塲，都印滿了日本商品的足跡。在亞洲者，如中國，印度，荷領印度，海峽殖民地，暹羅；在歐洲者，如英，法，荷蘭；在非洲者，如埃及，南阿，東阿；在大洋洲者，如濠洲；在美洲者，如中南美各國，都成爲了日本商品傾銷的主要市塲。世界各主要國家如英美法意等，都因日貨的傾銷而受到了莫大的威脅。去年二月間英日棉業會議中英國代表曾公然地說：「日本商品現下這樣對世界市塲的活動，威脅着各國的產業組織，萬一這種情勢，老是這樣繼續下去，那麽，其結果，日本恐怕將成爲世界共同的敵人罷。」於此當可想見一斑了。</p>
<p>我們知道，美洲向來是英美的主要市塲。單以南美和中美來說，列强於此投下的資金就有一百五六十億金元之多，佔它們對整個殖民地所投的資金的百分之五十；但其中英美兩國所投的就各有六十億金元，佔全數的三分之二以上，於此當可知道英美兩國在這兒的經濟力量是如何的强大。可是，最近幾年來，日貨在美洲，尤其是中美和南美的傾銷，竟顯示出了驚人的發展程度。請看下表丨丨</p>
<p>一九三一年　一九三二年　一九三三年</p>
<p>北美金額（千圓）四三八、八六五　四五三、九六五　四九九、一五六百分比三八·三　三二·二　二六·八</p>
<p>中美金額（千圓）三、三○一　五、一三○　一六、一七五百分比○·三　○·四　○·九</p>
<p>南美金額（千圓）一○、二二五　一三、一三三　三○、三七九百分比○·九　○·九　一·六</p>
<p>包含其他各洲的合計金額（千圓）一、一四六、九八一　一、四○九、九九一　一、八六一、○四五百分比一○○·○　一○○·○　一○○·○</p>
<p>這眞無怪乎英要要說「日本是世界共同的敵人」了！</p>
<p>日貨傾銷，眞像「水銀瀉地」，無孔不入，世界各主要國家都日益受其威脅。其所以能這樣者，不消說是由於日本商品的價値低廉。「單就日貨在歐洲市塲來說吧，電燈泡每只二分半，男人襪子每雙四分半，金筆尖自來水筆每枝七分半，九件咖啡用具每套四角九分，自由車每輛四元五角六分，人造絲在馬賽的售價比在里昂的紗價還低，棉織品可以比歐廠出品的成本减低百分之四十至七十。」其在别的地方的售價，也要比當地的市價低廉。所以牠才能在全世界傾銷。</p>
<p>何以日本商品的售價會那樣的低廉呢？若依日本人自己的意見，則是：一。日圓低落，對外匯市下跌；二·技術進步，產業合理化；三·勞動賃銀低廉，生產能率增進；四·海運便利；五·日「滿」經濟關係日益緊密，刺激日本的產業發展；······（參看日文「外交時報」十二月號九九頁）。這的確都是日貨所以低廉的重要原因。但因篇幅關係。我們不能將這些原因一一詳論。現在且將許滌新先生對這問題的一段說明引在下面，以供參考丨丨</p>
<p>「厲行傾銷是以通貨膨脹，降低工資，和加强勞動之榨取爲前提的。······三年來日圓跌價約在百分之六十左右，　售價格雖祗提高百分之十八，然而生活費（東京）指數，則從一九三一年之一三六，增加至一九三二年之一四八。至於貨幣工資，一九三一年的指數爲九一·三，一九三二年六月則降至八五·一。工資减少百分之六，而生活費則提高百分之九，日本工人的實質賃銀，二年間，竟减少百分之十五了。工人之所得非常减少，可是工人之勞力却反而深度地被壓取出來的。據三菱銀行的統計，日本一般的工業生產指數，一九三一年爲一○○·七，一九三三年十月却增加至一三七·六，三年之間，提高了百分之三十七。這百分之三十七的生產指數，便是日本工人在降低工資，加强勞動的狀况下所支出來的血汗。」（見「東方雜誌」三十一卷十八號三五頁）</p>
<p>近年日本產業的向上，日貨價値的低廉，日本商品之能在各處傾銷，威脅世界市塲，其最主要的原因，乃是在於日本對其本國工人之榨取，以使其各種商品的成本低廉。</p>
<p>世界各主要國家旣受到日貨傾銷的威脅，當然要設法對付。於是，英國首先促使印度大增日棉進口稅，限制其棉織品的輸入；同時並提高自國關稅，抵制日貨傾銷。美國自一九三三年施行農業救濟產業復興法以來，也實行提高關稅，並將限制日貨輸入。荷領東印度也與英國同時進行抵制日貨之傾銷。·······這樣，日貨在世界市塲的進出中，眞好像「老鼠過街」一樣，到處都在喊「打！打！」了！如果日本商品還要繼續在世界市塲上拚命傾銷，我們相信其他各國定會不斷想法對付的。</p>
<p>可是，英美等國對於日貨的傾銷，尙可以用提高關稅，限制輸入·······等辦法來抵制，只有一般弱小民族，特别是半殖民地的國家，不能用極有效的辦法來對付。所以，日貨在到處碰壁的時候，便拚命向抵抗力較弱的地方襲去。我國自來是日本最主要的市塲，在其商品傾銷之下，當然首當其衝地被其掠奪。似此情形，我們應採取如何對策，這是希望全國人士特别注意的。</p>

<h3 id="c260">文藝研究的卡片法 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 逸君</p>
<p>「卡片法」是一個最好的搜集研究資料的方法。任何研究學問的人，都可從這種方法裏得到不少便利。文學家的搜集寫作的材料，利用這種方法也可以得到不少的帮助。現在我想把這方法及其在文藝研究上的應用，作一個簡略的介紹。</p>
<p>首先我不能不把「卡片」這東西的本身說明一下。「卡片」的形式通常是一種約四寸長三寸闊的長方形的厚紙，不過也有比這大些小些的。紙也不限定那一種，道林紙，斜紋紙·····都可用，只要牠適合兩面能寫而又易於收藏和不易破損的幾個條件。紙的顏色最好是不同，這乃是爲了材料分類上的需要；比如就文學說，從文學書報上讀到的有價値的材料不妨用黃紙筆記下來，寫作的材料不妨用藍紙記，雜感隨筆心得疑問等不妨用淡紅紙記之類是。這還是粗枝大葉的分類，也有更精細的分類，例如在創作方面，你要搜集一篇小說的材料，你要用一種顏色的約去記牠，别一篇小說的材料，你不妨用另一種顏色的紙去記牠了。總之，紙的顏色可以有好多種，而目的完全是爲了便於翻檢，查考和分類。這種工作幹了許久之後，同類的材料就積得很多，你對於這件事就知道得很多，寫起來你就不會感到材料缺乏的痛苦了，你文章的内容也就不會是空虚無所有的了。</p>
<p>記的方法是這樣：比如你要作一篇小說（或是論文，小品，雜感·····均可），姑假定你這篇小說的名字呌「熱情」，你在卡片紙的左角上最先就須寫下這兩個字。在下一行你才可能寫下你的靈感，你所得到的材料，你的主題（如革命的熱情和戀愛的熱情的矛盾，衝突等），你的臨時想到的最得意的詞句，你的思想的流露·····這各種材料可以不相連貫，就是爲了怱忙而詞句寫得不通也不要緊，因爲這原不是給别人看的。今天得到的材料你固應隨時寫下，就是明天，後天，下月，下年，三五年，七八年之後，你這篇大著若還是没有寫好的話，你仍是要繼續不斷的隨時寫下那些必要的材料的。爲了一本著作，卡片紙積到數百張甚至數千張的事也不是没有過的。自然，普通的隨感，雜文等，只消一兩張或多則三五張也就够了。</p>
<p>實在這是一個最好的保存記憶的方法。現社會人事紛繁，我們的一點靈感，一點材料每易在不知不覺中消失得乾乾凈凈。假如我們是有用卡片紙律記的習慣的，我們可以把這些隨時保存下來，以後可以取之不盡，用之不竭。</p>
<p>很顯然的，用卡片紙筆記比用「筆記簿」要來得簡便，省事得多。筆記簿的最大缺點就是不便拆開，不便於歸類；翻檢，查考起來也太麻煩。筆記卡片紙却是隨時可用，而又可免除了上述的種種缺點。</p>
<p>這種卡片紙的置備也是至爲簡易的。因爲面積不大，普通一張道林紙可以</p>

<p>提起胡樸安先生，在腦海裏就會浮起「國學大師」四個字來。確實·時人中對於國學，有眞正高深的造詣的，胡樸安先生怕是魯殿靈光了罷！</p>
<p>他曾做過一任江蘇的民政廳長，宦海浮沈，似乎並不是他的長處，在任時聞頗欲發展他書生的抱負，惜衆人皆醉我獨醒，見效甚微，掛冠而後，仍兩袖清風，隱居滬上，從茲不再涉足政治漩渦，僅以辦報及任各大學敎課爲事。</p>
<p>我之識胡先生，是在××學院的文科班上。</p>
<p>在未見胡先生之前，總以爲胡先生是一位文質彬彬的書生，那知那天班上，胡先生腋下挾了皮包走上敎室的時候，才知我的揣測是大謬不然，而且荒唐可笑。胡先生完全是一個「北方型」的大漢，魁梧的體格，紫醬色的面色，嘴上長着一抹花白的長髯，鼻上架着闊玳瑁邊的眼鏡，戴着瓜皮帽，穿着寬大的灰布長袍。</p>
<p>丨丨密斯脫×，你看他老人家的精神多少矍鑠啊！</p>
<p>丨丨是的，而且聽說他在任何學校中的任課，都準時上課的，没有時下大學敎授揩油時刻的習氣。</p>
<p>我記得那天的課，是上午七時開始的。這時候不是正當那般公子哥兒，小姐奶奶們「高臥隆中」的時候嗎？</p>
<p>走上講台，在太史椅上安穩地坐定，將闊邊眼鏡從鼻梁上取下，點名啦，兩個睜着的大眼珠射在被喚名字的學生面上。那聲音是噌吰高抗，一聞卽知不是南方水土上生長的人物。而且發音雜着極多的徽音。</p>
<p>講的是「荀子學說」。</p>
<p>丨丨人之性惡，其善者，僞也！</p>
<p>說到這一句荀子的名言的時候，將那頂瓜皮小帽從頭頂上揭下，置在講台上，同時精神愈來愈奮發，索興從太史椅上站起來，「感慨系之」者十五分鐘，然後再坐在太史椅上，吟哦起他自編的講義來。</p>
<p>他的講義，文辭典雅，鏗鏘成誦，確是絶好古文。那幾張講義，至今尙藏在我的書箱裏。</p>
<p>整整一個鐘點裏，從開始至散班，我總記得他老人家的臉，始終是緊張的，甚至連一絲笑容也没有，當時我就擬想到一個古修道士的風度。有一次，不知講到什麽事情，老先生也破例的以男女戀愛作了譬喻，但出之於不說笑話的胡先生之口，總覺得有點不大貼合，我當時覺得。</p>
<p>不見胡先生已很久了。不意前星期六的下午，我在康腦脫路膠州路口走着的時候，迎面來了一位身材高大的老年人，昂首闊步而來，仔細一看，原來是胡先生。那天，北風凛冽，胡先生穿着一件寬大的大衣，因扣子没有扣上，大衣卽爲風勢張開。好像還有一位女郎伴着他同行，她大槪是他的令媛吧！</p>
<p>他也許不能呌出我的名字，但他確還能認識我的。招呼過後，我們没有在路旁多談話，就點首分别了。</p>
<p>我和胡先生的關係很淺，但他那崇高的精神，到處流露於他的言行裹，體態間的，給我的印象却很深刻。</p>

<p>好幾年前我在「中學生」上讀到謝六逸先生推薦這種方法的一篇「致文學青年」的文章，那上面說的雖嫌太簡略，但也頗可値得參考，我不妨錄幾句於下：「·······我勸諸君用「卡片制」，讓我們買了若干厚紙片放在抽斗裏；把我們每天的見聞，感想，都寫在卡片上。凡是五官所感觸的，直覺所想像的，都得寫上卡片。每天不論寫完幾張，隨手把他放在抽斗裏，日積月累之後，所積的卡片應該不少。在星期六的晚上，把卡片慢慢的整理，眞有不少樂趣。······」學者，作家，大學生，中學生，固可用卡片紙，卽一般失學的要研究學問的人，也未嘗不可用卡片紙呢。現在雖不是一個關門讀書研究的時代，但一個人至少總該有點知識，有點發表力，所以我仍把這個我用過的方法向我賢明的讀者諸君推薦了。</p>

<h3 id="c262">打油 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 鶴聲</p>
<p>安徽潛山縣通訊</p>
<p>記得曾國藩曾說過「養豬，紡布，打油，爲農家副業」的話。在我們安徽各地，特别是皖中，皖西，皖北各處，這三種農家副業，的確是很普遍地流佈着的。任何地方的農民，很少有不養豬，紡布的；各地把打油作爲副業的，自然也不在少數。卽如我們這小地方丨丨安徽潛山縣丨丨的村落裏，把打油作爲副業的農家，也「比比皆是」。</p>
<p>打油較之養豬，紡布，是一件比較麻煩而費手續的事情。打油首先得有一個工作機關丨丨「油坊」。在内地農村裏的打油，自然說不上使用什麽「機器」；打油器具只不過是些手工製造的「油槽」「油簍」之類，所用的勞力也不過是農民辛苦凝成的血汗罷了。「油坊」的組成大槪不外下列幾樣東西：一所專爲「打油」這目的而蓋成的房子，一個笨拙的「油槽」，「油槽」底下的「油道」，和接油的「油簍」等。這所房子的特殊設備是，牠的屋脊上必須有一個粗大的木樑，其上必須繫以極牢固的麻繩，繩下端則懸以重數百斤甚至千斤的重木。至於這種東西的用途，且留在後面再說。「油槽」的構造也是頗爲簡單的：一棵數人合抱的大樹，斫斷了，把中間挖空，刨光之後再在周圍鑲以鋼板，而在底面所鑲者須留有無數小孔，以便漏油。「油槽」兩旁又必須鑲以比「油槽」高出幾分的木板或鐵板，以便榨油時的「加尖」。爲了要壓榨「油槽」中的「油餅」，「油槽」上面的一塊重木板或重鐵板是必需的。還有，這種「油槽」通常都是用鐵樁釘成的，所以牢固非常。</p>
<p>「打油」的過程大致是這樣的：首先我們要有「油餅」。「油餅」有種種品質上的不同：有「芝蔴餅」，「菜子餅」，「棉子餅」······等等。從這各種「油餅」裏我們可以打出「蔴油」，「菜油」，「棉油」······種種不同的「油」來。「油餅」的構成也頗要費一番手續的。首先要把「油餅」的構成物：芝蔴，菜子，棉子······等曬乾，把牠拿來放在特製的「磨」裏丨丨這種「磨」通常是用牛拉着來工作的，牠的能力頗不小，一天可以磨十幾担丨丨來磨碎，磨碎之後又要放到鍋裏用火炒熟，炒熟之後又須和以相當之水使之粘濕，到最後又須「踹餅」。「踹餅」是把上面所說那炒熟了的而又粘濕的原料，放在一定大小一定形式的模子裏，用脚踹成「油餅」的一種手續。「踹餅」的人是一種有特殊訓練的「油工」。</p>
<p>我們有了「油餅」以後，就該把牠整整齊齊的放在「油槽」裏，要放得那末好：務使「油槽」裏不留一點孔隙。要放得平也是必需的一個條件。放平後，就用那塊重木板（或鐵板）壓在上面，加上「尖」，「油餅」受了壓力，「油」自然就從底下的小孔裏源源地流入「油道」中了。若油出不多，須要再打「尖」時，那一端尖削一端笨厚的「尖」（卽物理學上之「尖劈」）就須打進去了。這種「尖」通常是不很小的，而打法出至爲特别。上面我不是說過「油坊」粗重的屋樑上，必須用麻繩縣一根粗大的重木嗎？這就是爲了打尖而必要的。打法是前面有一個人像船上掌舵似的掌住此重木，使對準了那要打進去的「尖」，後面卽有四五個人或六七個人，各把住了重木的一方，用盡平生之力向那木尖打過去。這樣一而再，再而三的打，壓力大了，「槽」裏的油就又源源的流出來了。若油又流得少了，就再加尖，再打，以此類推，直到油被壓榨盡後爲止。</p>
<p>那接油的「油道」是構造得特爲傾斜的，爲的是便於油的「順流而下」。「油道」的末端緊接着一隻「油簍」，那油便涓涓不息的滴入簍中。簍裏油滿了，拿開，再換上别的一隻空的來接。那滿了的可以送到市上去賣，或去換什麽必需的東西。打油的農民們大都與市鎭上的油鹽雜貨店有來往的。</p>
<p>「打油」旣是一種「農家的副業」，到了農忙時分這種工作自然不免要停頓一時了。通常在舊歷三四五月的挿秧刈草時，在七八月的收割時，農民大都是無暇打油的。打油，從晒乾「油子」，磨碎，炒熟，「踹餅」，一直到「榨油」，頭尾要費去農民們頗不少的時間。光是從「踹餅」到「榨油」，也要費去他們三天左右的工夫。所以打油的最好時間是十，十一，十二，正，二，等的幾個農閒的月份。現在正是舊歷的十二月份，無怪我們這裏的農村裏，許多地方都在響着「油坊」裏的喧聲了。</p>
<p>提到這種喧聲，恐怕任何人聽了都要感到不耐煩的。重木打尖的聲音，油工「杭育」的聲音，互相配合着，成了一個喧囂的交響曲。最可惱的是不但白天如此，連晚上也莫不如此。假若你住在一個「油坊」近傍，你晚上休得想睡好覺。原來打油需人頗多，農人一家人手自然不够，而需要和别家「換工」，「夜工」當然更是求之不得的了。像這樣日以繼夜的日夜換班打，農民的辛勞也就不難想見的了。</p>
<p>打油的人除了農民自己和「換工」以外，僱的「長工」和一種有專門訓練的「油工」也常要來參與這種工作的。「長工」的本分是耕種，打油對他們却是一種額外的工作。他們爲東家打油，但得不到一點報酬。論年薪，他們每年所入共總不過三十餘元。這種人要算是最苦的了。「踹餅」專家的「油工」則多是臨時請來的，除供給伙食外，每日尙可拿到二角大洋左右的工錢。</p>
<p>有些農人自己没有油坊，要請人代打的，於是又有一種所謂「請工」。請油坊裏的人替你打，每担油子你只消出一元到一元五角的工錢就够了。通常打油不能少過二担七斗五升的油子，所以打一次油你必得出三四元左右的工錢。</p>
<p>最後還有一件奇怪的事不得不一提的，就是農民打油的目的反不在得「油」，而在得「肥料」。油榨完了的「菜餅」，「棉餅」，「蔴餅」是他們辛勞的主要目標。這眞是他們的生活决定了他們的愛好和需要。農民靠肥料吃飯，没有「油」吃倒不成什麽大問題。而這一點又恰好說明了一般農民們生活水凖的低下。</p>

<h3 id="c264">愛因斯坦傳（二） <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>廟恩的學校敎師們知道愛氏的數學才能過人，所以當他離廟恩赴米拉羅時，給與了他一張入大學的推薦書。這雖是没有實際價値的，但也不能說對於他的將來没有精神的效果。他在半年的自由生活之後，因爲在年齡上正是求學的時期，便不得不再進學校。但是意大利學校的語學程度很高，而他的語學又很平凡，不易考入，所以他只得到瑞士去了。結果是經了一些周折，由坡里特尼克姆大學的總長愛爾阿克的介紹，作了瑞士阿亞魯的中學校理科的上級生，這是一八九五年秋季的事情。</p>
<p>阿亞魯學校的空氣很自由，很開放，敎育法與一般中學不同，完全是大學的風味。所以他在這兒很快樂，如他在意大利一樣，並結交了很多朋友。</p>
<p>愛氏住在這兒的一個名呌維特拉的他的學校文科敎員的家裏。這位敎員有一個男孩和一個女孩，他們都和愛因斯坦很好，常常和他到瑞士各地去旅行。以後那敎員的男孩子與他的妹妹馬亞結了婚。</p>
<p>一年以後，他很容易地得到了證明書，正式地作了坡里特尼克姆的學生。</p>
<p>當時坡里特尼克姆的敎授，在物理學方面有費巴，在數學方面有敏可夫斯基等。費巴是這裏的數學，物理學的新敎室的建設者，努力於各種實騐的研究。敏可夫斯基對於愛因斯坦的相對論曾有着很重要的貢獻；同時，凱塞爾敎授的幾何學講義，在以後一般相對論的發展上也有着很大的帮助。但是，這時的愛因斯坦對於數學幾乎失掉了興味，比較起來他是喜歡物理學的。除此之外，他也曾涉獵其他學術的書籍，這時他所最愛讀的是達爾文的生物學和馬哈的哲學書籍。</p>
<p>在同學中最和他接近的人，是馬塞爾·格羅斯曼。這人在以後一般相對論的發展上是他的恊力者，與其成就有着很大的關係。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦在進坡里特尼克姆的第二年，卽一八九七年，當他才十七歲的時候，就努力研究光，以太，與地球運動相關的問題，卽後來的相對論的中心問題。</p>
<p>他在瑞士求學時的學費，不是由其父母担任的，而是由他的親戚們每月給他一百弗郎。他爲了要取得瑞士的國籍，每月由其中抽出二十弗郎來儲蓄，以其餘的八十弗郎來辦理一切事務。所以當時他的生活很窮苦，營養不良，以致後來常患腸胃病。</p>
<p>在瑞士的四年學生生活中，他的學識也相當地淵博了。但他爲眞正達到自然的核心之道的那個念頭所驅使，更去研究哲學，當時他很喜歡讀康德和胥彭甫爾及休謨的著作，特别是傾倒於休謨。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>一九○○年的秋天，愛因斯坦二十二歲的時候，他卒業於基里契的勃里特尼克姆（相當於我國的工科大學或理工科大學），以優等的成績通過了國家試騐。其畢業證書是可當作數學及物理學敎員的官凖執照用的。從此他便不得不離開他叔父們的帮助而去自謀生活了，但當他初次去向其敎授們進行職業的時候，却没有得到什麽結果，這可說是他第一次謀職業的失敗。</p>
<p>原來作瑞士學校的正式敎員，必須要有瑞士的國籍，而愛因斯坦却還没有得到這個；况且他是猶太人，就在自由的瑞士，猶太人也是到處受排斥受壓迫的。所以，愛因斯坦畢業後找求職業非常困難，一時之間不得不嘗嘗失業生活的痛苦了。待到第二年，一九○一年，他才找到了一個職工學校的臨時的位置。但這位置畢竟是臨時的，所以幾個月之後他又失業了，不得不暫時地過依賴朋友的生活。後來在新聞紙上發現了一個聘請家庭敎師的廣告，經過一番手續之後，好容易才救得了一個家庭敎師的位置。］、</p>
<p>一般大學物理學科的畢業生，多半是担任技師或敎員。但愛因斯坦畢業後，整整地經過了一年的時間，還未找到一個較適當的位置。這當然是他所非常焦急的問題。後來幸而他學生時代的友人馬塞爾，格羅斯曼同情於他的窮苦，請其父親爲愛因斯坦寫一封懇切的介紹信，把他介紹給伯倫的特許局長哈拉。由是愛因斯坦卽於一九○二年在伯倫特許局服務了。在這之先，他是已經取得了瑞士的國籍的。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦進特許局之後，生活算是比較地安定了。在這裏，他想盡可能地利用工餘乃至工作時間從事其偉大的研究。但局裏的規定是在辦公時間内不許作個人的事情，所以爱因斯坦要在辦公時間内做他的研究工作，實在非常困難。有時候，正當他在繪一個圖或在一張小的紙片上計算什麽時，如果一聽到門外的脚步聲，他便馬上將那小的紙片或正在描畫的圖形塞進抽匣裏去，不然，給局長看到了，必定是受嚴重的指責的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c271">誰是好萊塢賺錢最多的明星？（下）塵雄 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>百萬金片名表上音樂出品佔了最多數，而且自有電影歷史以來，舞聲片「四騎士」與「賓漢」歷年執着世界影戲院開映收入的紀錄，到有聲片一出，就被「可歌可泣」（又名「愚夫蕩婦」）打破了一切紀錄，而這張片子也是属於音樂出品的。</p>
<p>新奇的出品，對於賣座收入有很大的影響。珍妮蓋諾七張百萬收入的出品中，以「蝶酣花醉」的三百萬紀錄爲最高，雖然這張片子不能算是珍妮蓋諾最好的成績，但因爲她在這張片子初次開口歌唱，所以就利用新奇心理來吸收許多觀衆。</p>
<p>葛麗泰嘉寳雖然是好萊塢一個很紅明星，聲價比其他明星高越數倍，但她所演的戲祗有兩張出品是賺過一百萬美金，一張是她初次開口的「安娜克烈絲蒂」，因爲在廣告上大登「嘉寳講話了！」的新奇心理來引誘一般嘉寳迷的觀衆原故，果然「安娜克烈絲蒂」利市三倍，連嘉寳也夢想不到的。至於第二張百萬金出品是「大飯店」，這張片子不能算她個人的勝利，因爲「大飯店」的演員如巴里摩亞兄弟，華雷斯皮萊，瓊克勞福等，都是米高梅台柱，他們至少也可以拉攏一部分收入呢。</p>
<p>在全部百萬金片名裏我們可以找出一個很顯明的原理就是在許多賺錢的出品中輕妙快樂做題材的片子是佔了一大部分。這種片子的結局都是「有情人終成眷屬」之類，雖然有幾張巨片如「西線無戰事」，「萬世流芳」等以死亡做結尾的。</p>
<p>有一個時期美國影片很盛行以流氓黨魁做題材的出品，雖然在公映時候能哄動一時，但在收入上没有一張能够賺過百萬的。所以觀衆的採捨影片，當有好歹的判斷。指導社會，感化人心，寓敎育於娛樂等出品，都是愛觀衆歡迎的：反之，劇情淺薄，片子抄襲已前成功的出品都爲觀衆所擯棄的。</p>
<p>現在我們把美國影業報年刋所發表的百萬金片名曾在本國開映者舉其重要的幾張開列於後：</p>
<p>「可歌可泣」收入達五百萬美金，亞爾喬生主演，有聲片賺錢最多的出品。</p>
<p>「四騎士」收入四百五十萬，已故小生范倫鐵諾主演。</p>
<p>「賓漢」收入四百萬，現在此片仍在流行開映，將來收入還不止此數。</p>
<p>「戰地之花」，「重見光明」，「亂世春秋」，「邊外英雄」，「爵士哥者」丨丨三百五十萬</p>
<p>「蝶酣花醉」，「賽珍會」，「七重天」，「安琪兒」，「碧玉生香」，「同心結」與「回來的人」丨丨都是珍妮蓋諾的出品，有六張已在中國開映，第七張「回來的人」因内容涉及國人面子關係，没有到過中國。以上七張都是賺過一百萬美金，多者三百三十萬，少者一百三十萬「天翻地覆」丨二百七十萬。「淘金記」，「尋子遇仙記」，「十誡」丨丨二百五十萬。</p>
<p>「四十二號街」，「大飯店」，「歌舞昇平」，「儂本多情」，「小婦人」丨丨二百二十五萬</p>
<p>「壯志千秋」，「拯女記」，「麗娃栗妲」，「賴婚」，「戰地鵑聲」丨丨二百萬。「華清春暖」，「賤土黃金」，「西線無戰事」，「萬王之王」，「城市之光」，「四子從軍」，「鐘樓怪人」丨丨一百五十萬以上。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c272">一年來好萊塢電影業的新動態 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>時間之輪在迅速地推進，送去了一九三四年，而迎來了一九三五年。在過去一年之中，我們如果把好萊塢的電影業檢討一下，那麽除了美國片有特殊的資本色彩在海外各國佔有特殊市塲，依舊保持着，過去的情景之外，可以找出幾種新的動態：</p>
<p>一副重大的桎梏　第一，好萊塢的影片公司，在過去一年之中，攝製影片，已没有以前的自由了。所謂清潔運動，給予美國的電影業一副重大的桎梏，影片的内容，所謂肉感，和有傷風化的，都在被禁止之例。此外，檢查會檢查條例的格外嚴格，宗敎機關的反對，攝製一張影片，旣要顧到不受某一方面的制裁，又要顧到某一方面的不致反對，眞所謂小心翼翼面面顧到，否則便會遭遇意外呢！</p>
<p>文學影片的風行　在這種環境之下，影片公司的攝製影片，題格方面，爲了避免檢查和制裁起見，便有採取文學作品的新動態。把已經成名的文學作品，攝上了銀幕，自然不致抵觸清潔運動，不致違反宗敎。而且這種影片，爲了故事早已爲一般人所讀過，而那些作者，又都是受人崇拜的文學家，所以影片公映之時，賣座一定很好的。證諸在最近一年之中，「小婦人」，「閨怨」，「基度山恩仇記」，「金銀島」·······等一連串的文學影片，在上海公映之時，都有極好的賣座，便是一個例子。此外，歷史片也非常風行，歷史題材和文學作品當然是同樣不受制裁的題材，這便是好萊塢影片公司最近所發現的一條新出路。</p>
<p>小明星鴻運當頭　從演員說來，一九三四年，在好萊塢更有一種新的動態，便是在影壇上，風頭出得最健的却並非一般已成名的影星，而是初上鏡頭的幾個童星。已成名的男女明星，在過去一年之中，除了少數之外，大都没有新的建樹，和新的進步。嚴格說來，有幾位反而在退步了，但童星之中，如秀蘭鄧波兒的成名在好萊塢，已經是煊赫一時的童星了。此外，更有不少童星，都已上了銀幕，而有成功之望。因此，一九三四年在好萊塢，我們可稱之爲童星全盛的年頭。童星在銀幕上有如此活躍，在好萊塢的電影史上，也許造成了一頁新的紀錄。一般正在鬧失業恐慌的父母們，却把兒女向影片公司登記，希望兒女成爲著名的童星，能够和秀蘭鄧波兒的父母一般，靠着女兒的成名，得有富足的收入呢！</p>
<h3 id="c273">影迷注意「空谷蘭」 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>「空谷蘭」原是明星公司當年的名貴默片，那時的主演者有張織雲，楊耐梅，朱飛，鄭小秋諸人。因爲情節曲折，哀婉動人的關係，曾受千萬觀衆熱烈歡迎。去年夏季該片在各埠公映時，賣座依舊不衰，由此可以知道該片不朽的價値了。</p>
<p>爲了適合社會人士的需要，這次明星公司將它改爲聲片，仍由張石川導演，主演的係胡蝶，高占非，宣景琳，嚴月閒等。而且這次許多的情感都由對白中表現出來，當然，聲片比默片更可觀了。</p>
<p>據說明星公司最近所收到各方人士詢問該片消息等來信，平均每天至少有一百封之多，由此當可預卜該片公映時之盛况了。</p>
<h3 id="c274">關於蘇聯國際影展會 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>中宣會電明星公司</p>
<p>邀派代表赴京商討</p>
<p>蘇聯於本年二月舉行國際電影展覽會，戈公振致電明星公司經理周劍雲君，請該公司推派代表，並邀集聯華公司代表，偕同胡蝶女士出席參加，已誌昨報。茲聞中央宣傳委員會，昨又致電明星公司云：「據外交部轉知蘇聯籌開世界電影展覽會，擬向貴公司徵求影片，並邀請著名演員前往參加，茲事有關國際體面，如何應徵，即希派員來京面商辦法爲要。中央宣傳委員會敬。」</p>
<h3 id="c275">「蛇蝎美人」不久出世 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>經過了極長的攝製時間和宣傳時間，化去了一注鉅大成本的「蛇蝎美人」，是國人極度渴望的一部聯華鉅製。</p>
<p>如果，說這片子是年來國製片中一部最精采的作品，那並不是言過其實的話，因爲在它完成之初第一次的試映時，已經有很多人這樣說。</p>
<p>當然，我們敢担保這是楊小仲「良宵」之後的一部有驚人進步的傑作。然而，大家也應知道，此片能够有如此成績，並不是偶然或僥致的，那去是由於工作人們的心血，努力，和一種堅固的合作精神換來。</p>
<p>不信等着看，此片不久即可公映。整個的一部戲，無論是在任何方面，處處都能顯不出它的一種强挺的姿態。尤其是陳燕燕和張翼，梁賽珍們的表演，那該說是好到無以復加了。</p>

<p>洪秀全連忙走上前去，執住了石達開的手，回過臉來，對楊曾二人說：「石先生文武全才，亦正是我們道中人哩，」說了，楊曾二人忙上前相見請坐，一齊在棹邊坐下，洪說道：「石先生大駕到此，一定有何高見賜敎！」石達開便道：「我聽得諸位在這裏的舉動，特地投奔帳下，充一名小卒，」洪欣然拱手道：「石先生才略勝我們十倍，這眞是天助我們，傾覆滿清的天下了，」石達開又謙遜了一下說道：「現在會民已經這般發達，但對於軍需糧餉，有多少準備，照曾先生的家財，在目下當然是够維持的，將來舉義起來，没有個後援，就怕感到困難了，兄弟此來，一則是把自己的小小產業捐進會裏，二則要介紹一位足够做個財庫的人物，給會裏壯點聲勢，」洪楊曾三人聽了，連忙說；「這眞是石先生慷慨好義，但不知所說的是那一位？」石故意笑着說：「此人近在眼前，就是桂平縣的韋昌輝」，曾聽了陡然立了起來，興奮的說道：「不是石先生說，我倒忘了，此人眞是一個非常的人物，家中有百萬家財，是這縣第一個富户，只是怎肯加入我們這裏？」石聽了，隨即起立說：「小弟倒和他有點來往，我願意去說他來加入，」當時洪楊曾三人，均非常高興，向石稱謝了，忽的蕭朝貴從外面跑來說道：「馮先生回來了，洪先生的寳眷亦一同接來了」，說着，衆人都立起，到外面去迎接，馮雲山從外面進來，領了賴氏洪宣嬌和馮的妻一同從院中走入，還有幾個壯丁，挑着箱籠衣包之類，洪與馮說了些勞苦的話，洪宣嬌和賴氏亦來和洪說些闊離久别的話，於是邀同入内間去。</p>
<p>在廣塲上，蕭朝貴在敎練幾個人玩單刀，蕭自己亦玩弄了一套，很是精彩，旁觀的人都拍手呌好，宣嬌同了一個女婢，在樹脚下立着觀看，亦不禁喝了一聲彩，蕭舞刀正酣，聽見宣嬌喝彩聲，連忙收住了刀，轉身見了宣嬌，忙打了個躬。走到她的身旁說道：「聽說洪小姐一身好武藝，今天大膽，請賜敎一下。」宣嬌聽了，帶了羞態說：「學是學過幾下，可是不成樣子，不敢獻醜。」蕭還是懇請，宣嬌不能推却，於是接過了刀，說了一聲放肆，就走了過去，耍起刀來，甚爲精妙。那些旁觀的武士們，一面看，一面喝彩，蕭朝貴更是看得出神，及舞止，很嬌羞的跑到蕭的面前，蕭極力的誇讚着說：「洪小姐的武藝眞高明極了！佩服佩服。」洪小姐一語不發的搖搖頭，把刀還給蕭，就飛步的跑過去了，洪秀全正和曾玉珩說着話，洪宣嬌跑了來，對秀全說。「大哥！我想練一隊女兵，將來亦可以有點用處。」洪曾當即回答說：「這倒是很好的意思，我們就可以召集起來」。宣嬌表示很高興的樣子說：「閒空没有事做，反而難過。」</p>
<p>蕭朝貴從此終日呆獃獃的變了常態，一天將一把刀的尖子，在地下畫了一個歪歪斜斜的不整齊的洪字，又寫上一個小字，發着呆想。突然有人暗暗走來，拍拍他的肩背說：「蕭大哥！你在想些什麽？」蕭受驚，抬頭一看，速忙把地下的字跡塗去，一面立了起來，却是秦日綱立着發笑，蕭笑着回答說：「我没有想什麽，我在想怎麽樣能够把武功再練得好些。」秦不信他的話，反而大笑，蕭亦笑了。却說這亦是一段姻緣。後來居然由秦日綱馮雲山二人向洪秀全說了，就將宣嬌配給蕭朝貴了。（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying met with He Yingqin at 8:00 AM today, reporting on the Japanese troop increase in areas such as Guyuan, Dushikou, and Dongzhaizi in Eastern Chahar. This afternoon, Song and Xiao jointly met with He to discuss the Chahar situation. Song's return to Chahar is yet to be determined. Regarding the Chahar Eastern Incident, it is reported that the Japanese side proposes that representatives from both China and Japan convene a meeting to discuss a peaceful resolution. The time, location, and the representatives from both sides are yet to be determined. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Shiqin and Yue Kaixian visited Takahashi and Matsui this morning, holding talks for an hour before departing. They then went to Jurentang to meet with He, reporting on the discussions with Takahashi and Matsui. Song Zheyuan and Xiao Zhenying also arrived at Jurentang to meet with He to discuss matters, dispersing around 2:00 PM. Our side generally agrees to send representatives to negotiate a resolution with the Japanese side, but the selection of representatives is still under consideration, and the meeting location is yet to be further discussed with the Japanese side. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsui went to Tianjin this afternoon to meet with Umezu. Matsui stated that the situation in the Chahar Eastern Incident would not escalate. There is one squadron of Japanese aircraft in Eastern Chahar, totaling nine planes. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsui, who arrived in Tianjin, met with the Japanese Garrison Commander Umezu, and then took the 11:55 train to Jinzhou, planning to take a plane to Chengde on the 27th to meet with the commander of the 7th Division. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsui arrived in Tianjin at 4:30 PM this afternoon from Beiping, where he was greeted by Oki and others from the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin. He immediately went to the Japanese barracks at Haiguang Temple to meet with Commander Umezu, reporting on the current situation in Eastern Chahar. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying stated that if the Japanese army does not exert further pressure, the situation should not escalate. The key to a peaceful resolution lies with the Japanese side. He plans to go to Nanjing when necessary to report to the central government on the situation in Chahar. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsui arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou at 8:00 AM on the 26th. After disembarking, he immediately met with Japanese military attaché Takahashi. At 11:00 AM, he met with Yue Kaixin, Zhu Shiqin, and others to discuss the Chahar Eastern Incident, merely exchanging opinions. By noon, Yue and Zhu had departed. Matsui left Beiping for Tianjin at 1:15 PM this afternoon. According to Matsui, he came to Tianjin to meet with Umezu to report on the recent situation in Chahar Province. He has no major tasks and will return to Zhangjiakou in three to five days. He hopes that the Chahar Eastern Incident can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. Regarding how to resolve it, all methods will be discussed in Datan in the coming days, with Colonel Nagami in charge. He believes that the Japanese army stationed in Datan, Eastern Chahar, currently has no intention of advancing towards Guyuan or Dushikou. According to Takahashi's statement to reporters, he met with Yue, Zhu, and others today to discuss the Chahar Eastern issue, but the meeting location, date, and representatives from both sides have not been determined. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsui arrived in Beiping on the 26th. It is said that there is news of the Chahar cavalry being mobilized. A reporter specifically visited a Chahar provincial committee member stationed in Beiping to inquire about this matter. According to the discussion, two regiments of Chahar cavalry stationed in Zhangjiakou originally had a plan to be transferred to Shangdu for rotation. To avoid misunderstandings, this proposal has been temporarily shelved. Other than that, only one company of cavalry stationed in Xiaochang has been withdrawn, with no other movements. The rumors are not factual. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military liaison officer Matsui arrived in Beiping this morning from Zhangjiakou. After disembarking, he immediately went to the Japanese embassy to visit military attaché Takahashi. According to Matsui, there are a total of 3,000 Japanese troops and 2,000 puppet troops in Shizhuzi and other places on the front line in Eastern Chahar. The Japanese army in Chengde numbers approximately 10,000, and the puppet army is under the command of Wang Yongqing, brigade commander of Zhang Hai Peng's unit. The Japanese army is commanded by Commander Nagami. The Japanese side intends to propose that both China and Japan send representatives to a meeting in Datan to discuss a peaceful resolution. He came to meet Takahashi and then went to Tianjin to meet with the Japanese Garrison Commander Umezu to report on the situation in Eastern Chahar and seek instructions on everything. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After discussions between Japanese military authorities here and representatives of the Ping Military Affairs Committee, it is said that the negotiating principles for resolving the Chahar dispute have been agreed upon. Although a bilateral meeting can be held soon, the date and location of the first meeting have not yet been determined. The Japanese authorities in Beiping are currently satisfied that there are no Chinese troops or militia stationed in the disputed area. Both sides stated that the front line is quiet and there have been no military actions since yesterday. However, according to Chinese sources, Japanese troops are very active inside the border of Rehe. There are 8,000 Japanese soldiers stationed in Taigu City (transliteration) and 1,800 Japanese soldiers stationed in Datan, equipped with 60 to 70 armed vehicles. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Guyuan and Other Places <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou dispatch: This morning, Japanese planes reconnoitered Guyuan and Hada Yingzi. The Japanese army in Eastern Chahar has not taken any action, and the local area is calm. The Japanese army has increased a large number of troops at Xifengkou and Jiangshan'ao. The Japanese headquarters is located in Datan. Guyuan is currently under the control of County Magistrate Han, who is stationed in the city. Various rumors are untrue. The majority of the Japanese army is on the Wuni River line, with approximately 1,200 soldiers. There is one airfield in Datan. Nagami is the commander in Eastern Chahar. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhangjiakou dispatch: Starting on the evening of the 25th, more than ten Japanese infantry and artillery soldiers stationed in Chengde have been increasing their forces towards the northern and southern Shizhuzi, Beizhaizi, and Xifengkou in Eastern Chahar. The transfer is still underway as of the 26th. Datan is the main camp of the Japanese army. Dozens of armored vehicles and tanks have arrived. The vanguard of the Japanese army's Nagami Regiment and puppet cavalry have advanced to Dongzhaizi, Changliang, and the Wuni River area. In total, the Japanese and puppet troops on the side of Guyuan have reached more than 4,000 to 5,000. The puppet unit of Li Shou Xin in the 2nd and 4th districts in front of Guyuan is inactive. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Official sources here learned this morning that the Japanese and puppet troops near Guyuan have not disturbed the area. The puppet and Japanese troops on the Dushikou side have increased compared to before, taking a more pressing posture. The commander of the Japanese Nagami Regiment sent a letter to Qin Dechun, director of the Chahar Civil Affairs Department, on the evening of the 25th, inviting him to send a responsible negotiator to Datan to discuss a peaceful resolution. Qin specifically telegraphed Ping to report. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the Great Wall line, the Japanese army transported troops to Eastern Chahar from Jie Lingkou, Xifengkou, Lengkou, Sa Heqiao, and Jianchangying on the 25th using military vehicles. Except for a small number left behind, all Japanese troops in Chifeng drove towards Duolun on the 25th. Currently, more than one regiment of Japanese troops has gathered in Duolun. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army increased its troops in Eastern Chahar by 1,600 last night, with 800 each at the northern and southern Shizhuzi and Xifengkou, along with 40 armored vehicles and weapons such as steel cannons and machine guns. According to the locations where the Japanese army has arrived, it has exceeded its previous demands, intending to occupy villages such as Wuni River, Changliang, and Sidaogou in Guyuan County. Moreover, the troops are increasing continuously. Although they verbally propose to discuss a resolution, the troops and weapons continue to increase, and they are indiscriminately bombing villages where we have no troops stationed. Their intentions are truly unpredictable. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou dispatch: This morning, Japanese planes flew to Hada Yingzi and the Guyuan area, circling at low altitude for reconnaissance. The Japanese army on the front line continues to fire shots to demonstrate. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Official sources report that the Japanese and puppet troops in Eastern Chahar did not launch any attacks this afternoon, and the area is calm. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Central Government Considers it a Local Issue <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government has consistently regarded the Chahar Eastern Incident as a local issue, instructing the Ping Military Affairs Committee to handle it. On the one hand, it is investigating our losses to use as a basis for negotiations. If the Japanese side does not take further action, this case may be easily resolved. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The central government's reply telegram arrived in Ping this afternoon, stating that the Chahar affair is considered a local incident, and no additional personnel will be sent north. The matter will be resolved through local negotiations. Yin Tong, along with Chahar negotiators Yue Kaixian and Yin Rugeng, met with Japanese embassy military attaché Takahashi tonight for preliminary negotiations. There is hope for a peaceful resolution of this matter. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to those familiar with the current situation, Japan's attempt to seize Eastern Chahar is not a recent development. Recently, they have strongly claimed that Changliang and Wuni River in Guyuan County are under the jurisdiction of Fengning County in Rehe, which is a pretext to carry out an invasion of Eastern Chahar. After the Japanese army advanced for several consecutive days, they have already crossed the area they claimed. Our side cherishes peace and hopes that the Japanese side will eventually realize their error.

<p>Japanese Side Claims Outer Mongolian Troops Withdraw</p>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the conflict between pseudo-Russian troops at Lake Buir, the Japanese and puppet sides claimed today that the Outer Mongolian Red Army has withdrawn due to the arrival of a large Japanese and puppet force at Khalkhyn Gol, and the dangerous atmosphere of tension has now dissipated. However, this dispute is both a Russian-pseudo issue and a matter between Japan, a country with joint responsibility for the national defense of the pseudo-Manchu state, and Soviet Russia. Therefore, Japan will lodge a protest with Soviet Russia. (26th Japanese Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan sent a letter to the Central Political Council, interpreting the penalties for impairing the silver standard currency. According to the Supreme Court's reply, the Ministry of Finance's draft temporary regulations on penalties for impairing the silver standard currency provides for penalties for 1) destroying silver standard currency or old one-yuan silver coins that are scheduled to be used in the same way as silver standard currency within a certain period, with the intention of profiting, 2) counterfeiting or altering the factory mark of the Central Mint, or reducing its weight, or collecting and delivering for use or with the intention of using, 3) using it to manufacture old circulating silver or silver ingots with the intention of using them. However, the current criminal law has no explicit provisions for punishing the above-mentioned acts, because old one-yuan silver coins, which are scheduled to be used in the same way as silver standard currency within a certain period during the silver standard currency period, are all common currencies. If they are only destroyed for profit, there is no basis for punishment. As for the factory mark of the Central Mint and the old circulating silver or silver ingots, they are different in nature from the common currency, so simple manufacturing, counterfeiting, altering, using, collecting, delivering, and reducing the weight are also difficult to punish according to the various articles of the law on counterfeiting, altering, using, and reducing currency. However, if there are situations of fraud, breach of trust, or embezzlement, the provisions of Chapter 10 or 31 of the criminal law can be applied separately. The corresponding letter is sent for your review. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e32">The Russo-Japanese Situation After the Transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo the day before yesterday, the issue of the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which had been under negotiation between Japan and the puppet state in Tokyo for a year and seven months, finally reached a final agreement in principle between the two parties on the morning of the 22nd of this month after 40 rounds of prolonged negotiations. The date for a formal resolution is imminent, so its success is already a confirmed fact. Today, as we recall the course of these sales negotiations, the interactions between the two sides have been sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, demonstrating the utmost in confusing maneuvers, making it truly impossible for people to discern the superiority of their tactics or who would ultimately prevail. However, judging from the terms of the agreement that have now been reached, Japan and the puppet state cannot immediately regard it as an absolute victory. Although the puppet state must pay a price of 140 million yen, the Russian side receives no more than 50 million yen in cash. Superficially, it seems that Russia is not coming out ahead. However, it is also manifestly clear that the Chinese Eastern Railway today no longer possesses the economic value it once did. Therefore, we cannot judge the reason for the final agreement of this negotiation solely in terms of the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway itself, but rather we must seek its significance in the impact it will have on the international diplomatic stage.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Eastern Railway has been jointly operated by Russia and our country, disputes have arisen from time to time. However, in terms of the past relationship between China and Russia regarding the railway, it was originally jointly owned. Now, Russia has suddenly made this transaction with Japan and the puppet state. From the perspective of our country's position, we naturally cannot agree to this kind of sale, and we must solemnly express this to maintain our consistent policy of "non-recognition." However, the land of the four northeastern provinces has already been forcibly occupied, so what leisure do we have to inquire about the transfer of this mere railway right? Empty arguments will not remedy the reality. Therefore, what we must clearly recognize today regarding this issue is the significance of the establishment of this negotiation for the overall situation of peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>I have often discussed that Russia and Japan are originally places where the forces of the two countries come into contact in the Northeast. Since the September 18th Incident has already occurred, Japan's economic power has been expanding daily, and Russia cannot but relinquish its interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, will Russia also be willing to concede its other military plans along with it? Does Japan have other further hopes beyond the economic benefits of the Chinese Eastern Railway? This is truly the most important question. Yesterday, the Russian Pravda commented on the Japanese government's efforts to resolve outstanding issues between Japan and Russia, saying, "It is astonishing that the Japanese Foreign Minister actually believes that Soviet Russia intends to relax its Far Eastern border defenses. It would be absurd to regard the Russian government's plans in the Far East as offensive rather than defensive." It can be seen that the hearts of both parties are still filled with suspicion regarding various military and political matters and have not shown the slightest sign of being dispelled. Moreover, according to recent telegrams, puppet troops from Heilongjiang suddenly clashed with Russian troops from Outer Mongolia again. A Hualian News Agency dispatch stated that Russian troops from Outer Mongolia occupied fishing grounds near Lake Baikal and also occupied the triangular area where the three rivers north of the lake converge, resulting in a clash with Japanese and puppet troops. The puppet troops suffered heavy casualties. Now, Japanese and puppet reinforcements have arrived and are engaged in fierce fighting. However, the Russian side's explanation is not yet clear. According to Reuters' speculation, it is questionable whether this matter will develop seriously. If Outer Mongolia sends troops to assist, the Japanese army will inevitably intervene, and the scope may not be guaranteed not to expand. Therefore, it is very difficult to predict the future of this conflict between Japan and the puppet state and Russian troops. The transaction between Japan and the puppet state and Russia for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway has only been completed for three or four days. The general public all believe that the relationship between Japan and Russia may gradually improve from now on. However, the conflict over the fishing pond occurred immediately afterward. Although it may only be a minor incident on the border, and the authorities on both sides may not be willing to expand it, it can also be seen that disputes can arise between Japan and Russia at any time, and spark a war at any time. Therefore, it may not be a profound understanding of the Far Eastern situation to say that just based on the agreement on the Chinese Eastern Railway, it is beneficial to the overall situation of peace in the Far East.</p>

<p>(Washington) The Senate continued to debate the United States' participation in the World Court today. The government tried its best to reject the additional clauses, but the opposition counterattacked with great force, causing the government leader to fail to immediately put the case to a vote. The Senate supported the government with 47 votes against 37, rejecting the amendment proposed by Republican Senator Norris. The case stipulates that US issues must first be approved by the Senate before they can be submitted to the Hague Court. According to general opinion, the Senate will ultimately adhere to President Roosevelt's wishes and pass the United States' participation in the World Court case.

<p>The Colonial Problem of Africa Resolved</p>

<p>Naval Issues Not Involved</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval reported today at a joint meeting of the House Foreign Affairs, Navy, and Colonies Committees on the contents of the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement and the process of its signing. He stated that Italian nationals in the French protectorate of Tunisia in Africa have enjoyed special privileges for 39 years, and fortunately, this problem has been resolved. This could not have been achieved without face-to-face meetings with Italian leader Mussolini and sincere communication. Although Italy is allowed to purchase some shares in the railway from French Djibouti to the capital of Abyssinia, France still holds the majority of the shares, and its management rights belong to France, so there is no problem. Italy's request to change the borders of its African territories was based on the 1915 Treaty of London. Now France has fulfilled its promise to incorporate part of the French territory south of Libya into Italian territory, which has been recognized by Italy, and this case can be concluded. As for the land along the coast of French Somaliland that is assigned to Italy, it faces the island of Doumeira, and it is far from the sea route from Europe to the Far East. Therefore, the Habelman-Dibout Strait in between can be opened and become a waterway. Now that the colonial problems between France and Italy have been satisfactorily resolved, France and Italy can cooperate closely to jointly seek peace, which is gratifying. Finally, Laval declared that naval issues were not mentioned in the Rome negotiations, because an atmosphere of mutual trust must first be created before new issues can be raised.

The Strait of Gibraltar tunnel is 32 kilometers long and passes through a depth of 400 meters below the sea surface, so its excavation is very vast. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Prague, Czech Republic - German engineer Follmi, residing here, was assassinated yesterday. The murderer has not been apprehended. According to the investigation, the murderer was originally German and fled to Germany after the assassination. Therefore, the general public believes that it was done by the German National Socialist Party. Today, newspapers are commenting on the case, all expressing indignation, saying that this act is undermining the right to protection that German expatriates should enjoy abroad, and that the incident of German philosophy professor, a Jew named Lesen, who took refuge in Czechoslovakia in August 1933 and was assassinated by the National Socialist Party, has now reoccurred. Some newspapers say that Follmi was the director of the Stuttgart radio station in Germany and recently invented a method of using radio waves to stop the engines of airplanes in the sky. This invention is related to Germany's national defense secrets and is extremely important. Therefore, since Follmi has taken refuge abroad, the National Socialist Party is determined to get him. Others say that Follmi privately set up a radio station in Czechoslovakia and broadcast to Germany, which was known to the German government, so he was put to death. After Follmi was assassinated, the police seized a radio transmitter with a wavelength of 50 meters in his room. The Czechoslovak Post and Telecommunications Department had already discovered the transmitter on November 23 last year and had been searching for it everywhere, but it was only now that it was discovered.

<p>Public Debt Bill Passed by the House of Representatives</p>
<p>Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>(Washington) The inflation faction suffered its first defeat in Congress today. Several amendments to the government bond bill proposed by them have been rejected by the House of Representatives. However, silver faction congressmen are not disappointed by today's developments, because the rejected amendments have no direct relationship with the silver issue. After the House rejected the inflation bill amendments, it passed the public debt bill by a vote of 152 to 30. The proposer was Doughton, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The bill amended the second free public debt bill and authorized the Treasury Department to issue new public debts of $1,525,000,000. The first blow suffered by the inflation faction was the House's rejection of the Taussig amendment by a vote of 90 to 54. The amendment limited the Treasury Department to having collateral equal to three times the currency in circulation. Since the Treasury Department has to issue huge amounts of new public debt to enable the government to get through next year, if the Taussig bill were passed, it would have a very large inflationary effect.

<p>Carrying 163 Passengers</p>
<p>At Least 47 People Killed</p>
<p>Another Tragedy After the Loss of the Morro Castle</p>
<p>(New York) After the Ward Line ship "Mohawk" was sunk by a railroad tug off the coast of New Jersey on Thursday, a total of 116 people were rescued, 31 bodies were recovered, and 16 people are missing. The ship had a total of 163 passengers and crew, so the number of deaths should be 47. Including this one, there have been four accidents involving Ward Line ships recently. The first was the "Morro Castle," which was lost last September, killing more than 100 people. After arriving in New York, the railroad tug "announced that the Mohawk" was operated carelessly, resulting in this disaster. A crew member of the "Mohawk" also said that the ship's engine was out of order and could not be salvaged, resulting in the collision. According to a passenger, after the collision, the crew drove the passengers to gather on deck and distributed life jackets. The ship sank very quickly, so the lifeboats were immediately lowered. The captain stayed on the ship and sank with it. All the rescued people were attacked by severe cold, resulting in several people being frostbitten. Many people jumped into the sea, some of whom were rescued and some of whom drowned. Professor Kellerland led six students on the ship to investigate the relics of Malay culture in Central America, but unfortunately encountered disaster on the way. Kellerland and one student are now among the missing. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>The Suzhou Suffered Thousands of Dollars in Losses</p>
<p>Many Crew and Passengers Were Kidnapped</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Recently, coastal pirates have been rampant in Fujian and Guangdong, with merchant ships being robbed more than once. The pirates all land at the junction of Raoping and Zhao'an, gather in the Huanggang, Zhelin, and Dongjie areas, and harass everywhere. Last year, the Suzhou was robbed en route from Huanggang to Shantou, losing over 10,000 yuan. The pirate Mai Hongji, hiding in a small boat in Jingzhou, was captured by the Shantou Public Security Bureau's detective team, escorted to Shantou, and executed by firing squad. On the 16th of this month, the Suzhou, departing from Huanggang and Zhelin for Shantou, was robbed by pirates for the second time and sailed towards the Zhao'an sea area. The Hechang Company, the ship's agent in Shantou, immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, requesting strict investigation of the pirates to facilitate navigation. The original report stated that on the 16th, the Suzhou departed from Huanggang, passing through Zhelin and Jingzhou, carrying 665 bags of brown sugar and four pieces of tin foil, with a total of over 20 cargo owners and passengers, sailing back to Shantou. At 2:00 PM, when sailing to the Fengshanwei sea area, suddenly six bandits disguised in military uniforms rushed into the wheelhouse, threatening the helmsman to steer the ship towards Zhao'an. They then confined the crew and passengers in the cabin. At around 6:00 PM in the evening, after arriving at the Xia'antou area under the jurisdiction of Zhao'an, several sailboats carrying dozens of bandits, each holding Browning pistols and machine guns, climbed onto the ship to search and rob, transporting the goods to each sailboat. A total of over 200 bags of brown sugar, worth approximately over 3,000 yuan, four pieces of tin foil, worth 500 to 600 yuan, and silver goods and clothes of the crew and passengers were robbed. Seven or eight cargo owners and passengers were kidnapped. The bandits set sail and left at night. This information is specially reported, requesting an order to strictly investigate the stolen goods in order to quell the bandit atmosphere. (22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e111">Details of the Japanese and Puppet Troops' Incursion into Eastern Chahar <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Presenting Unreasonable Demands and Suddenly Starting a War</p>
<p>Bombing Dongzhaizi and Pressing Towards Dushikou</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: After months of military deployment, the Japanese and puppet troops in western Rehe first presented unreasonable demands, followed by military action, using airplanes and artillery to bomb Dongzhaizi and pressing towards Guyuan and Dushikou. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Intentions: Young officers in the Japanese army, seeing that the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, are actively preparing to realize their ambitions. They are dissatisfied with the gradual approach of the diplomatic faction in their policy towards China, and have criticized it. They convened a so-called leaders' meeting in Dalian, advocating a radical approach. Furthermore, in light of the Soviet Union's increasing troops and arms in Kulun, they believe that the areas east and north of Chahar leading to Kulun are strategically important places that they must compete for. They believe that it is not enough to ensure victory unless they seize these areas and make advance arrangements. For two months, they have been actively preparing in areas such as Dage, Datan, and Duolun in western Rehe in order to intrude. Most recently, they made unreasonable demands privately and informally, but to no avail. In the middle of this month, they again used the pretext that areas such as Changliang, Wuni River, and the North and South Stone Pillars belong to Fengning County in Rehe, declaring that they would not hesitate to take military action, with the intention of seizing important towns outside the Great Wall of Chahar Province as military strongholds. Their aim is that if it can be achieved peacefully, there will be no problem. Otherwise, they will not hesitate to resort to force. All kinds of steps have been planned and are now being gradually implemented.</p>
<p>Details of the Incursion: Since the conflict between the Japanese and puppet troops and local militias in the Changliang area, the situation has suddenly become tense. In order to avoid causing trouble, our representatives Qin Dechun and Yue Kaixian negotiated with Matsui, the Japanese liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, based on reason. However, while the two sides were consulting, the Japanese and puppet troops in western Rehe suddenly intruded into eastern Chahar. The Japanese and puppet troops in the Datan area began to concentrate and move on the evening of the 22nd. Nagami, the commander of the 25th Regiment of the Japanese army stationed in Gubeikou, was ordered to lead about 1,500 infantry and cavalry, carrying artillery and machine guns, to Datan. At dusk, they moved forward, using the highway to transport them extremely quickly. At around 10:00 PM that night, they began firing machine guns at areas such as Longtan Temple and Dongqiaozi, carrying out provocations. Gunfire continued unabated all night on the 22nd. At 4:00 AM on the 23rd, 400 to 500 Japanese infantry and cavalry, carrying four heavy artillery pieces and more than 20 machine guns, launched a fierce attack on Longtan Temple and Dongzhaizi. At 10:30 AM, they fired more than 40 heavy artillery shells at Dongzhaizi and used airplanes to drop bombs. Only local militias were stationed there. As a result of the bombing by airplanes and artillery, more than 40 residents and militiamen were killed or injured, and the houses and villages were reduced to ashes. At noon, the vanguard of the Japanese army attacked the Great Wall line in the Dushikou area. At around 1:00 PM, four Japanese aircraft continuously dropped more than 10 bombs on the Great Wall line in that area. Japanese aircraft were also found reconnaissance over the Great Wall line in Longmensuo and Heihe, but did not drop bombs. Several Japanese aircraft reconnoitered over Zhangyuan City on the morning of the 23rd, but the infantry did not move. Outside Dushikou, the Japanese and puppet troops attacked continuously until 7:00 PM, when they stopped. The front was quiet on the night of the 23rd. At 10:00 AM this morning (the 24th), Japanese aircraft flew to Dushikou again to drop bombs, and the infantry continued to advance. At the same time, Guyuan was also alarmed. The situation at the front is serious. The headquarters of the Japanese and puppet troops attacking Dushikou are located in Datan. In the Dage Town area, there are more than 2,000 troops from the 7th Division of the Japanese army. In addition to artillery and aircraft, the Japanese and puppet troops originally had 20 tanks, and another 20 arrived today (the 24th). In addition to the puppet army of Li Shouxin, there are also more than 1,000 troops from the 7th Division of the Japanese army in the Guyuan area. The Japanese army has launched a war without cause. Our army is still defending the original defense line and has not moved out, maintaining a calm attitude in the hope that the Japanese side will realize their mistake.</p>
<p>Details of the Negotiations: After the Japanese side made unreasonable demands privately and informally regarding the Chahar incident but to no avail, they remained silent for several days. Since the conflict between the Japanese and puppet troops and the militias in the Changliang area, both sides believed that local negotiations should be held. They dispatched personnel to investigate. At the same time, Takahashi, the military attache of the Japanese embassy, telegraphed the Japanese army stationed in Rehe, stopping the Japanese and puppet troops from advancing. At the same time, Qin Dechun and Bing Kaixian began to contact Matsui, the Japanese liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, in Zhangjiakou. Matsui, carrying the orders of the Japanese army, proposed that the two sides send representatives to Datan to negotiate. Since the Japanese army launched military operations the day before yesterday, the squadron has repeatedly received telegrams from Zhangjiakou. Yesterday's military branch meeting once raised it for discussion. This morning (the 24th) at 10:00 AM, Song Zheyuan again visited He Yingqin to ask for instructions. Relevant parties have telegraphed the central government to report. Currently, negotiations between the two sides have not been interrupted. The primary goal is to stop the military operations at the front. It is difficult to predict how the future will unfold.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan's Statement: According to Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan this morning, yesterday (the 23rd), the Japanese army attacked Dongzhaizi outside Dushikou, stopping at 7:00 PM. According to the investigation, the Japanese army dropped bombs on Dongzhaizi and fired more than 40 artillery shells. More than 40 militiamen and residents were killed or injured. We had no troops stationed in that area and there was no contact. The Japanese side had made unreasonable demands, and I am arguing based on reason. I will stay in Peiping, and the date of returning to Chahar is uncertain.</p>
<p>Takahashi's Statement: This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Takahashi, the military attache of the Japanese embassy, held a tea party for Chinese and foreign reporters. He said that the conflict in eastern Chahar is a local issue and will not affect the overall situation in North China. Negotiations are underway and will be resolved within a few days.

<p>Fang et al. Leading Hundreds of Confidants</p>
<p>Disguised Themselves and Fled into the Deep Mountains</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The bandit gangs of Fang Zhimin and Luo Binghui, since joining forces and roaming the border areas of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui, have organized themselves into the 7th and 10th Army Groups, which are divided into the 19th, 20th, and 21st Divisions, with more than 7,000 people and a full array of guns. Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Yu Jishi, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, to be responsible for suppression and ordered Wu Chengren's division and the groups of Wang Yaowu and Li Wenbin to be placed under Yu's command. Yu personally led seven regiments and two battalions of the Zhejiang Security Corps to encircle and fiercely attack them. On December 14th of last year, in Taiping County on the Anhui border, they killed Xun Weizhou, the commander of the pseudo 7th Army Group. His body was found in Maolin Village in Jing County, and his head was cut off and displayed in Tunxi. The bandit side suffered heavy losses, and their morale was shattered, determined to flee. After various units pursued them relentlessly, the bandits circled around, passing through southern Anhui and returning to Jiangxi Province. They were repeatedly intercepted and pursued at Fangcun, Jiangcun Liukou, Yicun, Xikou, Dalongshan, and Xujiacun. When they reached the Jiangxi border, the remaining bandits numbered only 2,000. In addition to Xun's death, Luo Shaohua, the military and political commissioner, and Liu Ying, the director of the political department, were both seriously injured. Wang Yizhi, the commander of the pseudo 20th Division, was killed in the Battle of Dalongshan. Wang Ruchun, the commander of the pseudo new 19th Division, was killed in the Battle of Xujiacun. The bandits' corpses have all been found. The bandit suppression forces then surrounded the bandit troops in the eastern territory of Dexing. After days of separate pursuit and interception, the bandits were beheaded, captured, and scattered in greater numbers at Gangtou, Fenshuiguan, Yinzhuang, Huaiyu Mountain, and Baji. Zhou Qun, the director of the protection bureau of the pseudo army group, was captured alive by Wu's division, and thousands of bandits were captured. According to the confession of Zhou Qun, the captured director of the protection bureau of the pseudo army group, the two bandit leaders, Fang and Luo, returned from southern Anhui and planned to pass through western Zhejiang to northern Fujian to contact the red bandits in eastern and northern Fujian, hoping to reorganize. However, they were fiercely attacked head-on by the Zhejiang Security Corps in Xingkou City and Xujiacun and could not flee south to Changshan. They then turned towards the eastern territory of Dexing and fled. Furthermore, because the various armies were pursuing closely, they climbed over the Nanhua Mountain and fled overnight, abandoning many horses and baggage. They were again blocked and attacked by Wu's division and Li's brigade at Gangtou and Fenshuiguan, and Wang's brigade pursued them in Yinzhuang. The military morale was panicked, and the internal collapse led to an irreparable situation. In particular, the two forces in Xingkou and Xujiacun were the key to breaking the bandits' southward escape. Yu himself is still searching for the remaining bandits at the front. The gangs of Fang and Luo have now been completely eliminated. The people in the border areas of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui can finally rest easy. (25th)</p>

<p>In the Wangdian and Xiashi areas of Jiahe, Zhejiang Province, there have been years of famine, and farmers have been displaced, flocking to Songjiang to beg for food. Li Zuhua, the director of the relief home, has raised huge sums of money from all walks of life to provide emergency relief. Zhou Xuewen, a gentleman from Shanghai and the president of the Songjiang County Red Cross branch, sympathizes with the lack of shelter for the displaced people and the danger of freezing and starvation. He obtained approval from Xu Shiying and Wang Yiting, giants of the Shanghai charity world, to allocate 10,000 yuan to set up a shelter in Songcheng's Chaoguo Temple, which can accommodate 3,000 refugees every day. Li Zuhua, the director of the local relief home, has also raised funds from all walks of life, distributing grain every day, with a total of 2,000 yuan already distributed. The joint establishment of a shelter by Mr. Zhou, a native of the county, and the Shanghai gentlemen, is a unique highlight for the Zhejiang refugees.</p>

<p>The case of changing the measuring instruments used in the local rice and bean industry to the new system has been repeatedly delayed due to procedural delays. It is now scheduled to be implemented uniformly from February 5th. In the past two days, Qin Hemen, a metrology inspector, went to the rice and bean industry association to inspect the new measuring instruments, and more than 400 have been inspected. Once the inspection is completed, it will be implemented as scheduled. At the same time, the county government will issue a notice to inform everyone.</p>

The provincial bureau has now appointed Zhang Shanglin, the head of the audit section of the bureau, to serve as the acting director. Director Zhang accepted the appointment and arrived in Changzhou on the evening of the 25th to take over the bureau, and took office formally the same day, leasing the Tang surname building on Xiaoye Bank as the bureau's address. As for the heads of the four county collection offices, Yu Yunqing has been decided for Wuxi, Xu Youxiang for Yixing, and Jiangyin and Wujin have not yet been determined. Wujin will likely be handled concurrently by the branch bureau. Gu Baoyu, the director of the provincial bureau, and Ding Zimei, the deputy director, previously came to Changzhou to investigate the tax collection situation of the two former branch bureau directors, Zhu and Huang, and also left Changzhou for Zhenjiang on the evening of the 25th.</p>

<p>丨A Review of Sino-Japanese Relations丨</p>
<p>4.  China's Mistakes and Miscalculations</p>
<p>Although China cannot bear the same responsibility as Japan for creating such a major incident, looking back from before and after the September 18th Incident to the present day, China cannot be said to be completely without errors in understanding or action that have led to such an intractable stalemate. These errors belong to the government, to the people, and are errors that the government and the people should both acknowledge. They are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Error of Missing Opportunities: Before 1930, we heard that the National Government had a tendency to resolve the issue of commercial lease rights. At that time, Japan had not yet signed the customs treaty, and all county cases were still pending. Later, it was said that the issue of commercial lease rights was shelved due to disagreements within the National Government. Originally, Japan was full of doubts and obstacles regarding the National Revolution, and it was no wonder that the Chinese Kuomintang did not arouse favorable feelings towards Japan. However, in international relations, are friends and enemies ever defined by rigid standards? If it benefits the country, one should put aside grievances and do it. Unfortunately, the authorities lacked this courage and missed a good opportunity. Otherwise, the Japanese military faction had not yet risen, and the prestige of political parties had not diminished. The relationship between the two countries might have improved, and the inducement for the September 18th Incident might not have occurred. After the September 18th Incident, public opinion in China was extraordinarily excited, but some people also recognized the crisis and advocated for an early resolution at the right time. For example, Mr. Hu Shih and others advocated resolutely engaging in direct negotiations based on the five principles proposed by Japan, regardless of the cost. However, the authorities ultimately hesitated and insisted on the principle of no negotiations without the withdrawal of troops, which prevented the rise of the Japanese moderate faction and increased the momentum of the military, making the problem more and more rigid. Even when Shenyang had fallen but had not yet invaded Shanhaiguan, there was still a possibility of stopping Japan at Jinzhou to gradually transform the situation. Unfortunately, every step was missed, resulting in an irreparable situation. This cannot but be attributed to the authorities' lack of determination and irresponsibility.</p>
<p>(2) The Error of Not Thoroughly Implementing Revolutionary Strategies: Some people may think that the above statement is too harsh in retrospect. China's hatred towards Japan has deep and widespread roots. Furthermore, with such a sudden and major stimulus, how could the authorities suppress the people's resentment and avoid internal unrest, even if they wanted to compromise for the sake of the country? However, what we are saying is based on the expectation of the Chinese Kuomintang, which has taken on the responsibility of saving the country through revolution. The difference between revolutionary diplomacy and ordinary diplomacy lies in being proactive rather than passive, adaptable rather than rigid, being firm when necessary, flexible when necessary, expanding when possible, and yielding when appropriate, fully implementing unchangeable goals with changing strategies. Historical examples are readily available. Have you not heard of Lenin overcoming public opinion and making peace with Germany? Instead, they were caught in a dilemma, unable to be strong or weak. Looking back at the events since September 18th, even if we do not say that the authorities had no intention of reversing the crisis, we cannot help but believe that they lacked the courage to make decisive decisions. Therefore, we increasingly believe that when the country is in distress, it especially needs great politicians. Now, the Chinese Kuomintang authorities lack both sincerity and wisdom, and the result is that they are trapped in a stalemate where they cannot advance or retreat. Even if we do not call it a betrayal of the country and the people, how can we avoid it?</p>
<p>(3) The Error of Judging the Opponent: After the September 18th Incident, there were many errors in the Chinese people's judgment of the situation in Japan. At that time, the general view was that although China's military strength was not as good as Japan's, the boycott movement could be used as a substitute weapon, so there must be no compromise with Japan. As long as the boycott movement lasted for a year or so, there would be major economic and political disturbances in Japan, and they would have no choice but to abandon the Northeast. However, China would have to expend great effort and endure great pain to consolidate its boycott movement front. At the same time, it did not clearly see the duration of Japan's ability to sustain, as well as the national psychology under its militarist control. This was a major mistake. Furthermore, after September 18th, China still thought that although Japan had caused this great disaster, it still had to consider international resentment and could not completely abandon its responsibility to international treaties. How could it know that Japan, driven by its ambition to dominate the Pacific and unify East Asia, had long regarded international treaties as mere formalities and considered various treaties as chains that restricted the development of its ambitions. It could not be treated as an ordinary country that abides by contracts and keeps its promises. At that time, some people in China even thought that the occupation of the Northeast was only the idea of Japanese warlords, and the enlightened public opinion of the people would be able to restrain the arrogance of the military. Therefore, at that time, Chinese public opinion was still speculating on the rise and fall of the Minseitō and Seiyukai party powers as a standard for response. How could they know that Japan was not an ordinary political party country or a constitutional country, but a special country controlled by a special class of military warlords? This error was completely proven later when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations and Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated on May 15th, but it was very popular at the time.</p>
<p>(4) The Error of Examining Self-Reliance: At that time, China not only did not know the enemy's reality, but also did not know its own. It either exaggerated its own strength too much or relied on it too much. It only judged the enemy's weaknesses, and had no time to reflect on or admit its own weaknesses. The general public, aroused by righteous indignation, even believed that short knives could defeat airplanes and that the army, relying solely on non-modern equipment, could participate in modern warfare, shouting for war and urging the dispatch of troops, making it impossible for the government to explain and difficult to respond. This kind of arrogant shout exposed its own weakness of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak, which only strengthened the momentum of the Japanese military. It is regrettable, but in fact, it was not only the people who observed incorrectly, but also the government's judgment of the situation of the enemy and ourselves was contradictory and erroneous. At that time, in the military aspect, when Japan launched an invasion of Rehe, it over-believed that the Northeast Army had considerable defensive strength by taking advantage of the dangerous terrain, believing that Japan would not dare to invade Rehe unless it transported more than six divisions of troops from other countries. It did not know that the spirit and strength of the Northeast Army stationed in Rehe had declined to this point. This was an error in examining self-reliance.</p>
<p>(5) The Error of Observing Third Parties: At that time, China not only lacked a true understanding of both sides, but also could not fully grasp the reality of third parties. At that time, from the government to the people, China always believed that the League of Nations Covenant existed, and Japan was one of the covenant countries. If it blatantly disregarded it, the League would be able to implement economic sanctions in accordance with the covenant. At the same time, it also believed that if friendly mediation by Britain, the United States, or other countries was ineffective, they would also be able to protect the dignity of the covenant or protect world peace and rise up to take forceful intervention. It did not know that Britain and the United States each had their own difficulties, and the Soviet Union was burying itself in preparing for diplomatic and domestic affairs, and obviously could not take positive action. In the autumn of world economic depression, countries became more and more uneasy about the breakdown of peace, and Japan became more and more unscrupulous. Afterwards, the intervention of Britain and the United States was not seen in reality, and the League of Nations made no indication except for a few resolutions, and had no power except for so-called moral sympathy. At that time, this error of judgment has been proven today, three years later.</p>
<p>(6) The Error of Internal Disorder: At that time, China, on the one hand, could not hide its weaknesses due to arrogance, and on the other hand, could not maintain the secrecy of diplomacy. Often, before the government had made a decision, the people had already made a lot of noise, and every move was seen by the world. It was impossible to strengthen its strength in an instant, and there were various restraints on its face, making it impossible to weaken. The more China showed its arrogance, the stronger the momentum of the Japanese warlords became. China was ashamed and resentful of Japan's gradual advance, and could only appeal to the world's justice. The Japanese authorities then used the fact that China trusted the League of Nations and expected Britain and the United States to shout to the Japanese people, "China is using the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians" to stimulate the feelings of the Japanese people, making the views of the enlightened faction more and more declining, and the expansion of the incident was endless. At that time, the Chinese authorities and the people were not consistent internally, the various factions of the people could not be consistent, the Chinese Kuomintang and those outside the party could not be consistent, and even within the Chinese Kuomintang, divisions were revealed due to diplomatic propositions at this time. Therefore, internal turmoil and foreign troubles became more serious. When we look back on the past, we really feel unbearable to finish speaking.</p>
<p>(7) The Error of Acting on Emotions: Many of the various errors in understanding, judgment, and measures mentioned above have become past events, and some are still being followed. There is no need to pursue the various errors that have caused the past situation. What is important is whether we can stop following the mistakes of the past in observing things without careful consideration and making decisions without courage from now on. When we silently observe the country, this can only be regarded as a kind of expectation, and it is still difficult to affirm at present. The author has clearly stated in the previous article that the Sino-Japanese stalemate must be broken. We know that the initiative in the Sino-Japanese issue is entirely in Japan. The first step to break the stalemate must be that Japan has the sincerity of awareness and the expression of giving up the occupation. However, if Japan expresses its desire to start negotiations, China may still have those who cannot agree to direct negotiations. China has suffered unprecedented humiliation and insults, and the excitement of emotions is a matter of course. However, we believe that the method of "mutual destruction" is definitely not a solution. If Japan acts recklessly to the end, China should naturally exert its best efforts to seek struggle. All nationals feel the same way, but "seeking survival in death" is ultimately a method when there is no other way. If it is possible to "seek survival in life," we should suppress emotions and value reason, and plan for the long-term for the country and the nation. If this concept is not liberated, I am afraid that the Sino-Japanese stalemate will still leave some obstacles and cannot be thoroughly broken. If this continues, blindly following and holding on to the stalemate will ultimately not be a blessing for the country and the nation.</p>
<p>5.  Japan's Mistakes (1)</p>
<p>...... The Direct Error in Understanding China</p>
<p>When it comes to the reasons for the incident and the inability to break the stalemate to this day, Japan's mistakes are certainly more than China's. Japan's understanding of China first fell into fundamental errors. Based on this fundamental error of understanding, judgments were made and plans were made, resulting in various errors in consideration. At the same time, because of being lost after the incident, the measures taken to respond to the international community also fell into errors. Now, let's first talk about Japan's error in understanding China:</p>
<p>(1) The Error in Understanding China's Current National Situation: I said in my previous article that Japan has no way to eliminate China's existence. The most important reason is that China is currently in a period of revolution. A country in the period of unfinished revolution is completely different from a country that already has a strong and well-defined organization. Japanese people view China, which is in the midst of revolution, as an ordinary country, and Chinese people view Japan, which is a special country under military control, as an ordinary country. Their errors are equal. In an ordinary country with a solid organizational structure, everyone knows that its elements are "land, people, and sovereignty (or government)." However, the historical examples of modern revolutions have shown us that a country in the revolutionary period is completely different from an ordinary country. Its elements are "ideology, leader, and masses." As for the masses, China has a large population, and the urgency of foreign aggression has created many patriotic people with a strong national consciousness. As for ideology, the Three Principles of the People have become a national consensus in China in the past seven or eight years. Chinese people may be dissatisfied with the measures of the Kuomintang authorities, but few oppose the Three Principles of the People. The Chinese intellectual class now generally recognizes that only by urging the Kuomintang to work hard to love itself can China be able to deal with foreign countries. Since September 18th, in fact, China has created a party and its de facto leader that can lead the national people. Therefore, as long as the ideology is widespread and deeply rooted, the leader exists in good health, and the masses support them unanimously, the success or failure of the temporary government or the gain or loss of land becomes a secondary issue. The Chinese National Government now claims to be a temporary revolutionary government, not a government after the completion of the revolution. Therefore, I said in the previous article that occupying the capital of China cannot control China's fate. If it cannot eliminate its leader, then the location of the leader is the location of the Chinese government and the center of national power. The Japanese think that if military actions continue and the territory shrinks, China will not be able to survive. How can they know that a country in the revolutionary period cannot be viewed as an ordinary country? The Chinese Kuomintang once encouraged the people to "consider the lost four northeastern provinces as Siberia before 1920 of Russia." I am not a party member and do not want to judge this statement, but the fact that China is still a country in the revolutionary period is an indisputable fact. From this, if the leader still exists, the Japanese will have no grasp of completely eliminating China. It is only a pity that Japanese China experts are unusually meticulous and thorough in their daily investigations and observations of Chinese affairs, but they neglect this important point.</p>
<p>(2) The Error in Understanding Chinese History and the Times: The Japanese claim to be able to understand Chinese history, believing that China, which is dominated by the Han people, could be destroyed by the Mongols more than 600 years ago, and by the Manchus 300 years ago. Why can't it be ruled by the Japanese today? This is another kind of observational error. Because in the late Song or late Ming Dynasties, Chinese people, except for a few Confucians, almost did not know that there was a change of dynasties, or that a minority ethnic group entered China to rule. However, when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown more than 20 years ago, not only did the revolutionary pioneers rise up and run around, but also a majority of the people participated. The overthrow of the Qing Dynasty was called for by the four slogans of the Tongmenghui: "Expel the Tartars, restore China, establish the Republic, and equalize land rights." The Xinhai Revolution marked a clear period in Chinese history, which was completely different from the previous changes of surnames and generations. Since then, at least the people have understood the meaning of nationalism. As for today, 12 million students in large, medium, and small schools across the country have a deep-rooted national consciousness. In addition, since the late Qing Dynasty, all literate adult nationals, calculated as 10% of the total population, also have 48 million people who know what it means to lose their country. Taking Japan's annexation of Taiwan and Korea as an example, 30 or 40 years ago, perhaps the majority of Chinese nationals did not know what relationship Taiwan and Korea had with China, and therefore did not feel any pain. Today, in many places, even farmers and old people know the fact that the four northeastern provinces have been occupied. This is not any power, this is the result of the changing times. Even if we talk about 60 million people, their number is close to the total population of Japan. Although Japan's military force is strong, it cannot eliminate all 60 million nationals who have a full national consciousness and make all of China obedient to Japan as submissive people. Therefore, inferring today's China by taking the historical examples of the loss of the Song and Ming Dynasties is another kind of error. Furthermore, when the Japanese observe Chinese history, they often only look for China's shortcomings from the bad aspects, and do not study the characteristics of the Chinese nation from the good aspects. The reason why China has been able to rise repeatedly and not be controlled by foreign tribes in the past dynasties is because China has a national spirit of entrusting life in times of crisis and the so-called righteousness between heaven and earth that has been passed down for generations. This spirit and righteousness are often expressed through the moving behavior of loyal ministers and people with lofty ideals in times of crisis and doom, and generations of teachers and Confucian scholars and surviving people write books and advocate, spreading them in songs and dramas, and becoming the main social education of China. This kind of education that is passed down from generation to generation has an unusually deep foundation. Almost Chinese people innately have some of this educational influence in their blood. Even in the main figures of modern China, there are still often quotes from Zhuge Wuhou's "Do your best and die, success or failure, profit or loss, do not look forward to the opposite" and "Cannot be subdued by force, cannot be moved by poverty and humbleness" and other sayings, as maxims for grinding determination. Therefore, the Japanese should not only see the situation when the Song and Ming Dynasties were destroyed, but not see the situation when the Chinese nation rose again in the late Yuan and late Qing Dynasties. They should not only see Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang of the Song Dynasty, but not see Yue Wumu and Wen Wenshan. They should not only see Hong Chengchou and Wu Sangui of the late Ming Dynasty, but not see Shi Kefa and Zheng Chenggong. In the recent 20 years of the Republic of China era, Japanese general up-and-coming China experts should not only see the actions of warlords such as Yuan Shikai who were imperialistic and selfish, but ignore the sacrificial spirit of revolutionary salvation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and others. We must know that this spirit and righteousness has always been permeated among the Chinese nation, and with the infusion of modern nationalism, this spirit has been entrusted and developed even greater, so when observing the Chinese nation, we must not represent it with a few shameless warlords and bureaucrats, but believe that it can all be threatened and lured. This level of meaning is really not understood by the Japanese new "China experts," but among the existing teachers and old Confucian scholars in Japan, there are still many old people who know the history of the East and understand the Chinese nation. If you ask them about this meaning, they will definitely allow the author's words to be correct.</p>
<p>(3) The Error in Observing the Chinese Kuomintang: The Japanese side also has two kinds of erroneous views. One is that the Chinese Kuomintang is the center of launching anti-Japanese forces, and the other is that the Sino-Japanese problem cannot be solved unless the Chinese Kuomintang is overthrown, and Japan cannot sleep peacefully. This is another fundamental error. I have explained at the beginning of this article: In China, the most thorough one who talks about the reason that China and Japan are interdependent is Sun Yat-sen, the president of the Kuomintang. In theory, when the National Revolution developed, Japan was the best opportunity to settle the unhappy relations between the two countries in the past and thoroughly renew the national relations. The Kuomintang after 1927 clearly abandoned the policy of tolerating communism, and there was no reason to make Japan afraid. From the analysis of the history of the Kuomintang and its characters, we really cannot see the existence of anti-Japanese elements. To be fair, a party with more than one million members cannot have absolutely consistent actions of its individual members, I am afraid that this is the case in all countries in the world. Accompanied by the deterioration of Sino-Japanese feelings, Kuomintang party members and the general public have the same resentment towards Japan, which is inevitable. However, among the Kuomintang cadres, from Sun Yat-sen to the Japanese ministers, there are not a few who have friendly exchanges and intellectual exchanges. Therefore, in China, the Kuomintang's theory is relatively clear about understanding the key to the survival of East Asia, understanding Japan, and understanding that China and Japan should be equal and work together and should not turn against each other and lose both. Taking recent events as an example, if Japan tries to read the amount of export trade to China before 1931, and then check the amount of trade to China in the years after 1932, and look at the number of their rise and fall, it can be seen that the number of Japanese trade to China shows a gradual recovery trend (the number of Japanese goods exported to China can only be fully expressed from customs statistics), which is a reflection of the policy of the Kuomintang authorities not wanting the relations between the two countries to become more tense. There is now a part of the Chinese people who are deeply dissatisfied with this kind of easing policy of the Kuomintang. I dare to say that if the National Government allows the people to be anti-Japanese, the relations between the two countries will become more tense, not to mention that Japan's economic losses will be incalculable. Therefore, if Japan thinks that the Kuomintang is the center of planning the anti-Japanese movement, it is definitely an error. Secondly, the deterioration of the Chinese people's feelings towards Japan has been caused by Japan itself step by step, and it is by no means the result of the Kuomintang's propaganda and encouragement. If Japan does not automatically improve its policy towards China, but only takes the elimination of the Kuomintang as a means to eliminate the anti-Japanese sentiment, then I dare to represent the general public who are not members of the Chinese Kuomintang and directly recognize that Japan's observation is a fallacy. I don't know if Japan's recent intentions are really like what it says on the surface to eliminate the anti-Japanese and to overthrow the Kuomintang? Or is it determined that the Kuomintang is an obstacle to Japan's absolute domination of China and wants to overthrow the Kuomintang? No matter from which aspect, the Chinese Kuomintang cannot be overthrown by any force within these ten years. Looking at the past, before September 18th, there were still many voices in China against the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek, but since Japan occupied the Northeast, foreign aggression has become deeper and deeper, and the foundation of the Kuomintang has become more and more solid. Now, the remarks and actions against the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek have become less and less. Although the dismemberment and division within the Kuomintang are still deep, the people have expressed their sympathy and love because Japan has tried its best to attack the Kuomintang. Isn't this a very clear example? Moreover, the Chinese Kuomintang can exist in China, and it has its inevitable reasons. In other words, the basis for its existence is not entirely in itself, but rather in the objective situation. It is undeniable that the Kuomintang's internal situation is a mess, and there are many places where its organization and spirit violate the modern style. Even if they compete for their own opinions and harm each other, the internal contradictions are really too numerous to count, but outsiders want to judge their fate by superficial observation, which is not in line with the facts. Looking at the past, since the second year of the Republic of China, the northern warlords have repeatedly borrowed the strongest foreign power to eliminate the Kuomintang, and they have done everything they can. However, the result of each oppression has turned to make the power of the Kuomintang more and more expanded. Even the most sinister third international communist party cannot achieve the goal of eliminating the Kuomintang. After March of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Soviet Russia's Borodin even said that he did not see that there was such a strong personality in the Kuomintang. As for today, it cannot be overthrown by any external force. Because the reason why the Kuomintang can still exist today is based on three factors: one is the historical mission, with China's history like this, there must be a Chinese Kuomintang. The second is the mission of the times. In today's world and era, there must be a Kuomintang in China that assumes the mission of the times. The third is the psychology of the people. Because China is in such a situation, national consciousness naturally requires a leading central force and organization. Therefore, the Kuomintang can never be overthrown. Even if it is overthrown, there must be an organization in China that leads the nation to deal with foreign countries. No matter what the Kuomintang's leaders cannot be eliminated. Even if they are eliminated, there must be second and third or even stronger leaders who will rise up in succession. From this inference, if Japan still has this kind of misunderstanding, thinking that it only needs to overthrow the Chinese Kuomintang or attack its leaders to make it decline, then China will have no central force to deal with foreign countries. This is actually the opposite of cause and effect. That is, according to the Japanese, the rule of the Chinese Kuomintang will not be able to withstand the oppression of external forces and collapse. However, the Kuomintang's current predicament is that a revolutionary organization is facing the national crisis head-on and is subject to the political responsibility constraints and restraints, so it reveals its exhaustion and contradiction everywhere. Once it is not in the government position and all the taboos are empty and the actions are free, its external force must be greater than when it is in the government position. Japan must be able to clearly understand what kind of force is spying behind the Chinese Kuomintang, what kind of influence the rise of this kind of force will have on East Asia, and after the Kuomintang is in the opposition position, its more than one million party members and the military force it can control are forced to take any means, and Japan is not difficult to imagine the result. Therefore, if Japan really wants to think about its own interests, this fallacy should be fundamentally corrected. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Further Negotiations Will Be Made</p>
<p>Li Xiaosheng Will Come to Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Mr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, left Beijing by night train at 11 pm the night before and arrived in Shanghai at 7:10 am yesterday. He went directly to the World Academic Society on Fook Hing Road to rest and visited Mr. Liu Luyin in the afternoon for discussions. According to Mr. Wang, this meeting with Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and various central figures in Beijing was only to convey the opinions of Mr. Hu Zhantang. As for Mr. Hu's three points, the central government has accepted them and implemented them one by one. The issue of unity has been initially completed here, and further negotiations will be made soon. Mr. Hu's representative, Mr. Li Xiaosheng, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the SS Hoover next Monday. I will make another trip to Beijing after meeting Mr. Li. The departure date should be in the middle of next week. Regarding Mr. Hu Zhantang's actions, whether to enter Beijing or go abroad, it has not been discussed yet. The central government hopes that Mr. Hu will enter Beijing as soon as possible to share the heavy responsibilities, but Mr. Hu attaches importance to the closeness of opinions, not the geographical closeness. Therefore, this is a secondary issue. Mr. Liu Luyin is still in Shanghai and has not entered Beijing. I am scheduled to go abroad and return to my post in the middle of next month, he said.</p>

<p>Developing Sichuan and Dredging the Yellow River</p>
<p>Last Year's Expenditure was 12 Million</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Council, went to Nanjing on the 22nd to discuss the Council's funding issues. He completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 25th. Yesterday, at 11:00 AM, he met with newspaper reporters at the Council's Shanghai office on Avenue Road, where he made the following remarks:</p>
<p>No Intention to Go to the US: According to Mr. Song, the Ministry of Finance previously considered sending a representative to the United States to discuss the silver issue. However, he personally has no intention of going to the US. As for whether the Ministry of Finance will still send a representative to the US, and whether the selection has been decided, he has no information.</p>
<p>Developing Sichuan: In addition to continuing to complete past projects, the National Economic Council has decided to develop Sichuan this year, with particular attention to road construction. He has decided to wait for the weather to warm up slightly before visiting Sichuan and plans to establish a Sichuan office of the Council to handle all matters.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Problem: Regarding the dredging of the Yellow River, there are both fundamental and temporary solutions. The final decision will be made after experts from the League of Nations conduct an on-site inspection. However, the fundamental solution would require hundreds of millions in funding. Therefore, some people advocate implementing temporary solutions first.</p>
<p>Council Funding: The Council's expenditure last year totaled over 12 million. As for this year's funding, in addition to the previous year's remaining funds, 6 million has been allocated. The purpose of his visit to Nanjing was to discuss the funding issues of the Council. Currently, the Council still has several outstanding matters, and he will go to Nanjing again in the next few days.</p>

<p>Meeting Held at the British Consulate General the Night Before Last to Discuss Preparations</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, May 6th of this year marks the 25th anniversary of the accession of the British monarch. Representatives of major British community groups in Shanghai held a meeting at the British Consulate General on Friday evening to discuss preparations for the celebrations. The meeting was chaired by Sir Brenan, the British Consul General. The detailed arrangements have not yet been decided, but it has been tentatively agreed that the celebration program should include an English children's carnival in the afternoon, prayer services in churches, and inviting people from other countries to participate. In the evening, there will be a military review at the racecourse. Sir Brenan and others were then appointed to form an executive committee to draft the celebration program and formulate detailed plans based on the proposed items. Afterwards, Sir Brenan delivered a speech on the virtuous governance of the British monarch and requested the election of a committee to decide and implement the detailed arrangements.

<h3 id="e122">Selecting Antiquities to Ship to England <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Currently Inspecting and Verifying as Part of the Handover Procedures from the Previous Administration</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Chinese antiquities will be exhibited at the Chinese Art Exhibition in London. Since the government approved the British request, a preparatory committee was specially organized to oversee the matter with great care. It was also designated that the antiquities stored in Shanghai at the former Palace Museum serve as the standard for selecting items for exhibition in England. According to Mr. Shu Chushi, a specialist in overseeing the antiquities, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection and Selection: The inspection and selection of antiquities are fundamentally two different matters. Recent reports that selection has already taken place are incorrect. The inspection of antiquities is because, since the change of leadership at the Palace Museum, the antiquities have not been handed over to the new director (Ma Heng). The simultaneous inspection in Beijing and Shanghai is the handover inspection. The selection of antiquities is the responsibility of the preparatory committee for the Chinese Art International Exhibition. The selection responsibility should be taken over by the preparatory committee in Shanghai. However, the antiquities we are currently inspecting at the Antiquities Museum are part of the antiquities that will be selected for shipment to England in the future. As there are many antiquities, without a target, it is difficult to start. Therefore, the selection is still based on the inventory list from today's inspection.</p>
<p>Detailed Inspection: Regarding the inspection of antiquities, there are four departments storing antiquities in Shanghai: 1) the Antiquities Museum, 2) the Documents Museum, 3) the Library, and 4) the Secretariat. The current inspection is of the Antiquities Museum. The Antiquities Museum stores over 2,000 boxes of antiquities in Shanghai, of which 581 boxes have been inspected. Approximately 20 boxes can be inspected each day. Although the antiquities have been inspected in the past, it was too careless, leading to theft incidents. To prevent future fraud, we are carefully registering and recording details, such as variety, dynasty, size, weight, pattern, and color, regardless of the inconvenience. The inventory list of the former Qing Dynasty Aftermath Committee is far less detailed than the current records. The current inspection inventory list is divided into ten copies: one for the Executive Yuan, one for the Ministry of Education, one for the Antiquities Preservation Committee, five for the Palace Museum, and the remainder for the inspectors themselves.</p>
<p>Selection Standards: The government ordered the Palace Museum Council to decide on the standards for selecting antiquities to be shipped to England. It was decided to use the antiquities from the Antiquities Museum for participation. The antiquities from the Antiquities Museum include bronzes, lacquerware, porcelain, jade, embroidery, calligraphy, and painting. Selection will be made from each of the above categories. However, there must be two of the same item, or a photo on file. During the current inspection, items with photos on file will not be re-photographed, while those without photos will be photographed. To expedite the inspection work, Beijing has recently sent ten more people to Shanghai to assist. The preparatory committee can send personnel to Shanghai next month to be responsible for presiding over the selection.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Tomorrow is the Third Anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>｜Notice from the First Special District Municipal Federation｜</p>
<p>Shops and Citizens Fly Flags at Half-Mast for One Day</p>
<p>Visit the Miaohang to Pay Tribute to the Fallen Soldiers</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation issued a special notice to the member stores under the district branches yesterday, stating that tomorrow is the anniversary of the "January 28th" national humiliation: "Dear Sirs, as the anniversary of the January 28th national humiliation approaches, all members of our Chinese nation feel the pain of remembrance. It is hoped that your district branch will notify the member stores and citizens under your jurisdiction to fly flags at half-mast for one day on that day and observe three minutes of silence at 1:28 PM to commemorate the compatriots and soldiers who suffered in the Shanghai Incident. Please also ask the committee members of each district branch to lead citizens to Miaohang at 10:00 AM to pay tribute to the fallen soldiers. This is especially hoped for. Accordingly, this letter is sent to you, and it is hoped that you will check and handle it accordingly."</p>
<p>More than 20 people, including She Bingwen, Zhou Yuting, Wu Zisheng, Xu Shili, Fu Changyu, and He Quansheng, were present, with Gu Xinyi chairing.</p>
<p>Reporting on the Process: Chairman Gu Xinyi first reported, stating briefly that due to the severe drought last summer, the fields were cracked, and the autumn harvest was poor. Therefore, fellow traders and the banking industry in Shanghai ordered foreign rice from Saigon and other places to regulate the people's food supply. By the time of the autumn harvest, all the rice was on the market. Although the harvest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces was less than in previous years, the total amount of rice shortage was estimated at about 3 million shi. It has now been found that fellow traders and non-traders from both Shanghai and other places have ordered foreign rice. According to reports from various foreign firms, it has exceeded 6 million bags. The demand exceeds the supply, which will inevitably lead to a drop in the market price of domestic rice, affecting the rural areas. The association fears that it will cause economic risks to fellow traders. In order to reduce this phenomenon, the association convened a general meeting to discuss appropriate methods. The association hopes that all the committee members present will express their opinions.</p>
<p>Total Amount of Foreign Rice: The foreign firms that undertook the agency for ordering foreign rice include Da Yuan, Shun Jinlong, Yuanli, Fujia, Jiecheng, Jinfu, Guangjilong, Yali, Heyi, Baolong, Xiangmao, Dafu, Jinlong, Yongda, Dafeng, Taihe, Hengfeng, and 17 other companies. The total amount of foreign rice ordered is as follows: 1) Shanghai: A. Those that have already arrived amount to 150,400 tons. B. Those that have been loaded and are en route to Shanghai amount to 53,700 tons. C. Those that have been ordered but have not yet been shipped amount to 315,300 tons, totaling 549,500 tons. 2) Ningbo: 125,200 tons, totaling 674,700 tons, which is 6,747,000 bags at ten bags per ton.</p>
<p>Resolutions: After each executive and supervisory committee member expressed their opinions on the foreign rice issue, they began to discuss it. Some committee members advocated that the association should stop registration and implement restrictions from today, and stipulate penalties. Some committee members believed that business is free, and if the association implements restrictions, it will inevitably cause a backlash from fellow traders. If there is no forced prohibition, it will lose the credibility of the association. It was then resolved to report the total amount of foreign rice investigated by each foreign firm to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for handling, and to issue a notice of a persuasive nature, hoping that fellow traders would pay close attention. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>Passed New Work Plans for This Year</p>
<p>Elected the President and Committee Members for This Term</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese Benevolent Childhood Association held its sixth annual meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM in the grand hall of the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road. More than seventy people, including Kong Xiangxi, attended to discuss the work outline and budget for the 24th year (1935) and to amend the association's constitution. Xiong Xiling, Cai Yuanpei, and others also attended and gave speeches. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Those who attended yesterday included President Kong Xiangxi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, President of the Academia Sinica Cai Yuanpei, Legislative Yuan representative Sun Zhidong, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, Municipal Party Headquarters representative Mao Yun, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau representative Chen Lengseng, as well as Xiong Xiling, Lin Kanghou, Ding Shujing, Ding Fubao, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jianping, Zhao Jinqing, Li Tingan, Du Yuesheng, Wu Weide, Yan Fuqing, Zhu Shaoping, Yang Dunfu, and more than seventy others.</p>
<p>Proceedings: After 3:00 PM, the meeting was called to order with a bell.

Xu Jianping reported on the general situation of the work in the 23rd year (1934), and Lin Kanghou reported on the economic situation in the 23rd year. President Kong left the meeting due to other business and was replaced by Wang Xiaolai, who invited Xiong Xiling, Cai Yuanpei, and Chu Minyi to deliver speeches successively. Then, Lin Kanghou proposed a discussion on the budget for the 24th year, Zhao Jinqing proposed a discussion on amending the constitution, and He Weide proposed a discussion on the work plan for the 24th year. All were approved in order. Finally, representatives of party and government organizations delivered speeches before the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>President's Report: President Kong Xiangxi reported that today is the sixth annual meeting of the association. In the past year, thanks to the enthusiastic guidance of people from all walks of life and the efforts of the association's colleagues, the association's work has made much progress. The convocation of the National Benevolent Childhood Leaders Conference last year was of great significance. The issues raised for discussion and the various resolutions passed at the conference were very satisfactory. Benevolent childhood undertakings are extremely important to the country and society. Today's children are the future leaders of society. In this time of national crisis, we want to rescue this crisis, and we rely on each individual to be loyal to the country and society. If we want to cultivate talents who can fully serve the country and society, the education and upbringing of children cannot be ignored. If the education and upbringing of children are inadequate, how can we expect them to be fully effective when serving the country and society? Conversely, if children can be given excellent education and upbringing, they will surely serve the country and be loyal to the nation in the future, and they will achieve very satisfactory results. The ancients said, "Respect the elderly of my family and extend it to the elderly of other families; love the young of my family and extend it to the young of other families." The so-called loving the young of my family and extending it to the young of other families means that parents should pay attention to the education and upbringing of their own children, and also hope for the education and upbringing of children in general. Since its establishment, the association has had a history of six years. In these six years, although some aspects have not been achieved due to environmental factors, it has indeed achieved considerable results so far. Due to my other duties and busyness, I have not been able to devote myself to the benevolent childhood undertaking. Fortunately, colleagues and people from all walks of life have devoted themselves to the guidance and efforts of the benevolent childhood undertaking, and we have achieved today's results. I would like to express my deep gratitude here. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life and colleagues can continue their efforts with a spirit of continuous encouragement. The revival of the nation and the strength of the country depend on this, which is by no means superficial. Let us encourage each other.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong's Speech: Xiong Xiling continued with a speech, briefly stating that the association has made remarkable progress in its work and has achieved excellent results recently, which I greatly admire. Everyone is able to participate enthusiastically in today's conference, and I believe that the future of the benevolent childhood undertaking will be bright. I have two thoughts here: 1) In this transitional period, there may be those who do not understand the benevolent childhood undertaking, or those who understand it but not deeply. The former are generally old-fashioned and even oppose the methods of benevolent childhood, believing that China has not had so-called new methods of education and upbringing in the past, and children have still grown up and become outstanding talents. The latter are people of the new era, but they have not paid close attention to the care of children. Today, parents who receive higher education often specialize in a certain field of study and do not have time to study the education and upbringing of children, so they only know to send their children to nurseries or kindergartens and no longer inquire. However, children must never survive independently of their families. If there is no good education and upbringing in the family, the impact will be significant. The development of transportation, the easy spread of various infectious diseases, and the increase in the stimulation received by children are all factors that cannot be ignored. Judging from the current situation in China, families in urban areas may think that children enjoy better conditions than those in poor rural areas, but this is a great misconception in practice. When we look at families in urban areas, their furnishings may be exquisite, but they completely disregard the happiness of their children, often entrusting their children to nannies or caregivers without asking how poorly the nannies or caregivers live and dress, so their children are often affected by the nannies or caregivers and cannot be healthy. Therefore, we must make parents use scientific new methods for the education of their children. 2) Regarding the past childhood education and upbringing institutions, such as nurseries and kindergartens, they manage the children they receive entirely with school management methods. As a result, children can make considerable progress in their studies, but they feel weak in their ability to cope with the environment and various other activities. The Xiangshan Benevolent Childhood Institute, which I run, has been seeking to improve these shortcomings in recent years. In the past, each teacher managed dozens of children, which made the teachers unable to focus and made it difficult for the children to benefit. Now, the institute has set up a family department, where each teacher manages only ten children, so they can be in close contact with them at any time and place. The results of this method are much better than before. Therefore, my second thought is that teachers should be like parents.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's Speech: Cai Yuanpei spoke, briefly stating that the ancients paid great attention to respecting the elderly and loving the young. The so-called "comfort the old and cherish the young." Our association takes the promotion of benevolent childhood as its mission. Some may think that benevolent childhood is more important than respecting the elderly, or that other relationships are more important, but let's put that aside for now. Life can be divided into three stages: the first is childhood, the second is adulthood, and the third is old age. The elderly have fulfilled their obligations to society for many years and can rest. Adults are working hard for social undertakings, and children are expected to take on responsibilities in the future. Nations with undeveloped cultures only pay attention to the present, while countries with developed cultures focus on the future. The so-called savings and so on are based on this idea, to restrain the present, sacrifice the present, and prepare for the future. The ancients said, "It takes one year to grow grain, ten years to grow trees, and a hundred years to cultivate people." Farmers sacrifice their spirits in one year and hope for a harvest at the end of the year. Tree planters sacrifice ten years of time and hope for the harvest of trees growing in ten years. The same is true for cultivating people. Children are responsible for the future of the country, so adults should sacrifice their spirits for the education and upbringing of children. For example, when a ship encounters danger at sea, women and children must be rescued first, and adults are willing to stay behind. Although this has the meaning of helping the weak, it also emphasizes the importance of children. When I was in Austria, Austria lacked milk, so the milk was allocated, and children were given it first, and the rest was given to adults. When we look at the progress of the world, the responsibilities of future people will be greater than those of present people. In other words, future people should be better than present people in terms of ability. In other words, the education and upbringing given to today's children should be more important than those given to children in the past. Only in this way can future people bear this heavy responsibility. The content of benevolent childhood can be divided into two: one is education, and the other is upbringing. Education without upbringing is futile, so upbringing is more important than education. We should have appropriate adjustments for all the clothing, food, and housing of children, and hygiene should be especially emphasized. In childhood, because of close contact with the family environment, parents should be perfect role models for their children. The ancients said, "Confucius's family members did not know how to scold, and Zengzi's family members did not revile." In the families of Confucius and Zengzi, every word and deed was in line with morality. When we organize benevolent childhood undertakings, we should remind those who are responsible for raising children to pay close attention to this. We must do our best to help them. Even if we cannot help directly, we should provide assistance in their work indirectly, so that great achievements can be made.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu's Speech: Chu Minyi spoke, briefly stating the importance of the benevolent childhood undertaking, which everyone should do their best to promote. People should not only enjoy themselves in this world, but should also think about where they came from, so they should respect their ancestors and love their descendants. Our people have always had the saying "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest," and "Having many children and grandchildren is the greatest happiness." Therefore, the Chinese nation has reached four hundred million or even four hundred and fifty million to this day. Now, countries all over the world are paying close attention to the encouragement of population reproduction. For example, if a family has too many children, the government will bear part of the education expenses of those children, so the population of various countries is expanding rapidly. Although our country's population is still large, the quality of the population has been ignored, so we have the title of "Sick Man of East Asia." In the future, if we want to strengthen the race and strengthen the country, we must pay attention to the quality of the population, that is, to give children full education and upbringing. I believe that attention to hygiene and the promotion of physical education should be strengthened, etc. Representatives of the Municipal Party Headquarters Mao Yun and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Chen Lengseng also delivered speeches (omitted due to length).</p>

<p>According to the China United News Agency, the agency's reporter visited Mr. Mirigubsky, the Soviet Russian Vice Consul in Shanghai, at 11:00 AM on the 23rd, and he received the reporter and made remarks. However, he specifically instructed the reporter not to publish his personal opinions. However, because the illegal sale and purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway harmed our country's sovereignty, the agency still published his remarks to arouse the attention of the people of the country. The TASS news agency's statement that the Soviet Russian embassy denied receiving the China United News Agency reporter is a strong statement to obliterate the facts. This is hereby declared.</p>

It should be requested that the Ministry approve the matter. Based on this, the report is true. If the above item is transported by passenger car, how should the transportation fee be charged? Please inquire. The Ministry has replied that the fire extinguisher bucket is said to be similar to a bicycle, and the area is also similar.

<p>Rescheduled for Further Hearing on February 1st</p>
<p>Li Zhenfu, a Cantonese man who once served as the manager of the Shanghai Bank's Moganshan branch, had previously developed a romantic relationship with Huang Peixian, a woman from the same hometown, out of friendship. Li was unmarried, and Huang was unwed, both being in the prime of their sexually mature years. A lonely man and a lonely woman, once they came into contact, were like magnets drawn to iron, inseparable. It seemed easy to achieve a happy marriage. Unexpectedly, the sea of love is turbulent, with its movements unpredictable. The deep affection suddenly turned into profound resentment. As a result, the pursuit of a good match was unfulfilled, and lawsuits arose repeatedly. In the autumn, although Li offended Huang, he did not diminish his ardent admiration for Huang, even though she treated him like a stranger. He could truly be described as having a singular passion and being rich in unrequited love. They both belonged to the modern stream, and their daily lives, actions, and etiquette were all required to cater to the trends of the times. December 25th was Christmas, and Li specially prepared flower baskets and candies, personally driving his motorcycle on that afternoon at 4 PM to send them to his beloved Huang Peixian, who resided in apartment number 3 in Lane 3, Jing'an Temple Road. Upon arriving at Huang's room number 5, he found the door tightly closed, so he placed the gifts on the ground and stood to knock. Huang heard the sound inside, knowing it was Li. Initially, she offered him the cold shoulder, then she cursed and scolded him from inside the room, and finally, she suddenly flung the door open, raised her delicate hand, and slapped Li's cheek, kicked the baskets with her natural foot. Li felt humiliated by receiving such treatment while presenting gifts, which was rare in his life. He immediately ordered his driver to call the police to reason with her, but both sides continued to revile each other in Cantonese. The officer tried his best to mediate. Soon after, the Jing'an Temple Police Station also received a report and dispatched Western Officer Number 15 to rush to the scene, advising Li to go downstairs first. Huang was still filled with anger, picking up candies and throwing them at Li from afar. Afterward, Li went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report the circumstances of being provoked and assaulted, then returned to consult a doctor, who said that his arms and other parts were injured by the beating. Consequently, he hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a criminal self-accusation against Huang. Yesterday afternoon, the First Special District Local Court held a hearing before Judge Yinghua. The defendant, Huang Peixian, claimed to be ill and did not attend. Her lawyer appeared in court and requested a postponement. Li Zhenfu then recounted in detail the experience of being assaulted while delivering gifts, saying that although the defendant was a woman, she had practiced sports in school and was therefore very strong and powerful. A slap on the cheek was of no consequence, but his arm was injured by the beating, although he did not initially notice it, but only realized it after consulting a doctor, who said it was an internal injury. Next, Chinese Officer Number 2117 reported the circumstances of the conflict between the two parties that he had witnessed. Judge Xiang then granted the defendant's request, ordering the hearing to be rescheduled for February 1st in the afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Creditors of the China Industrial Bank Held a General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Lu Xihou Failed to Raise Sufficient Funds, Creditors Rose Up to Reproach Him</p>
<p>The creditors' group of the China Industrial Bank held a general meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 2 PM. More than 500 people attended. Yin Shouguang, Luo Jiaheng, and Qian Zunmin served as the presidium. After the formalities, lawyer Dong Yu first reported on the progress of the negotiations, followed by lawyer Wu Linkun, representing Lu Xihou, who stood up to state that his client, Lu Xihou, had been granted bail by the First Special District Court less than two weeks ago. Before the bail was granted, he had agreed with the creditors to first repay half of the debt. However, since being bailed out, the time has been very short, and he has been running around everywhere, intending to borrow cash from various parties. Unexpectedly, he has been rebuffed everywhere, and even some organizations that were expected to be able to help have recently gone bankrupt themselves, so everything has come to naught. Now, he has tried his best to raise 40,000 yuan in cash and is specifically proposing two conditions to the creditors: 1. Creditors with claims of 500 yuan or less (amounting to approximately 40,000 yuan in total) will be repaid 20% first. Creditors with claims of more than 500 yuan (amounting to approximately 200,000 yuan in total) should preferably agree to a temporary postponement. If absolutely necessary, he proposes to repay 10% first. 2. Lu Xihou has borrowed several land deeds from various parties and is willing to hand them over to the creditors, who can then seek mortgage loans from banks to distribute the funds. If the above two conditions are agreed upon, they can be implemented accordingly. If the creditors object, Lu Xihou is willing to return to prison to await punishment, thereby repaying the creditors, etc. A creditor then stood up and said that before Lu Xihou was granted bail, his lawyer had stated that Lu Xihou had raised cash from various parties, and if he were granted bail, he could repay the creditors 50% first. He even said that the funds had been deposited, and once Lu was released and signed the documents, the repayment could be made accordingly. Unexpectedly, Lu Xihou has now gone back on his word. We are not willing to be deceived and have decided to resolve the matter legally with Lu. At this time, all the creditors applauded in agreement, and the order gradually became chaotic. During the commotion, Lu Xihou suddenly made some inappropriate remarks on stage, which aroused the public anger of the creditors, who rose up to argue with him. Lu Xihou's younger brother then came forward to mediate. The creditors, due to the similarity in their clothes and appearance, mistook him for Lu himself and surrounded him. After he explained, they dispersed. Lu Xihou, in the midst of the commotion, had changed into someone else's clothes and secretly left the meeting place. Thus, the two sides have reached extreme positions. The creditors insist on first repaying 50%, while Lu insists on 20%. The creditors' representatives, Wu Peng and others, then resigned from their positions and left the meeting in protest, making the situation even more deadlocked. Subsequently, Lu's wife went on stage to express her apologies to the crowd. The creditors resolved to make a demand to Lu: 50% repayment for claims under 500 yuan and 20% repayment for claims over 500 yuan, to be paid before the final settlement deadline, with the remaining debt to be repaid after the final settlement. Lu Xihou is required to respond in the newspaper within two days. The meeting adjourned due to the late hour.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Decides to Operate Public Buses in Pudong <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-South Public Bus of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities started operating, its business has been quite prosperous. In addition to adding routes in the Shanghai-South district, it is also planning to set up new routes in Pudong to facilitate transportation. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities,</p>
<p>Shanghai-South Buses: The ring road route and the Longhua-West Gate route operated by the bureau in Shanghai-South have been quite successful. However, due to the recent soaring gasoline prices and the low fares set by the bureau, there are concerns that the revenue may not be able to offset the expenses. If gasoline prices rise further, the increased expenses will inevitably require alternative solutions. The bureau originally planned to switch to using charcoal, but the three ring road routes are short, and there are more than ten stops, so the horsepower may not be sufficient.</p>
<p>New Pudong Route: The bureau will open a new public bus route in Pudong in March this year. This route is actually very necessary, so the bureau will strive to make the operation of buses on this route a reality. However, due to the high gasoline prices, charcoal will be used instead. Since the route is longer and has fewer stops, switching to charcoal should not cause concerns about insufficient horsepower. Therefore, the bureau will conduct preliminary tests. If it is successful, it will consider reforming other routes as well.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Taifeng Canned Food Company Owes More Than 600,000 <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Debts Owed by Others Are Insufficient to Offset the Debt</p>
<p>Creditors Jointly Sue the Court</p>
<p>The Taifeng Canned Food Company on Nanjing Road has been in business for decades, and its business has always been prosperous. In recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn and the decline of all industries, it has also felt the strain on its working capital. Consequently, on December 20th of the lunar year, it announced the temporary suspension of business and entrusted accountants Xu Yongzuo and lawyers Zhang Zhengxue and Zha Renwei to handle the liquidation affairs. Therefore, the creditors of the company initially believed that their debts would be secured and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, after more than a month, the company has announced no definite measures, and the general creditors have become highly suspicious, fearing that it will use the name of liquidation to imitate the bad habit of賴債 (defaulting on debts). Therefore, currently, 46 creditors in the banking and money industries, including Shanghai Bank and Tongqing Money Shop, have hired lawyers Sun Yuan and Xu Zuyan, based on the current Regulations on the Liquidation of Merchants' Debts, to file a petition with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the Taifeng Company be declared bankrupt and that its movable and immovable properties be provisionally attached to protect their claims. It is reported that the amount owed by Taifeng to these banks and shops is only over 150,000 yuan, while the total amount owed to others is as high as more than 600,000 yuan. The assets owed by others to Taifeng, including the company's Xiaoshadu Road factory base and buildings, the Nanjing Road storefront and business goods, various stocks purchased by the company, various guarantee deposits paid, and the property of a certain match factory that has also suspended operations, are only worth 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. The difference is quite large, so the banks and shops have sought the protection of the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao Dejun of the First Special Court held a hearing. Lawyers Sun and Xu, representing the petitioning banks and shops, appeared in court and stated the reasons for their request, asking that the company be declared bankrupt, that all account books be seized, and that auditors be appointed to conduct liquidation. Before the declaration of bankruptcy, they requested that all its properties and goods be provisionally attached. After reviewing the case, Judge Tao ordered the petitioners to file a separate statement regarding the provisional attachment and await verification. As for the request to declare bankruptcy, he also directed them to wait for further investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Xu Qimei Was Deceived During the Shanghai War</p>
<p>Shen Zhijing's Marriage Agreement Was Unfounded</p>
<p>Xu Qimei, a 26-year-old woman from Suzhou residing at No. 1, Yongyu Lane, Baylor Road, French Concession, has recently hired lawyer Ping Heng to file a criminal complaint in the First Special Court against Shen Zhijing, a foreign firm comprador from the same hometown residing at No. 32, Yongqing Lane, Xin Dagulu, accusing him of using deception to make her mistakenly believe that they had a marital relationship, enticing and abandoning her, and attaching a civil lawsuit, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the hearing in the Criminal Court No. 8. The defendant, Shen Zhijing, did not appear. According to the plaintiff, Xu Qimei, during the January 28th Incident, she met the defendant in Shanghai. He took care of her attentively and persuaded her to move to Suzhou to avoid the disaster. Moreover, the defendant expressed that his home was still empty and that he wished to form a lifelong alliance with her. As a lonely bird in troubled times, she could not help but feel grateful for his comfort and care. The defendant then made solemn promises, saying that after the war subsided, they would return to Shanghai to hold a wedding ceremony and would never be careless or deceitful. Because she was burdened with debt at the time, she did not have time for private plans. The defendant also offered to repay her debts and was willing to write an IOU, further specifying her status as his wife. Seeing his enthusiasm, she agreed to live with him first. Between husband and wife, their affection surpassed that of painted eyebrows. Later, as the situation stabilized, they moved back to Shanghai. She asked the defendant to fulfill his previous agreement and hold a wedding ceremony. However, the defendant claimed to be economically distressed, using excuses to delay. Once he was a little better off, he would make up for the marriage contract. If she did not believe him, he would write an IOU stating that if either party changed their mind midway, they would be liable for compensation of 5,000 yuan. Seeing his gentle words and sincere feelings, she could not bear to push him too hard. Recently, she heard that the municipal government had group weddings, and the wedding ceremony was very economical. She then ordered the defendant to prepare for the wedding. Unexpectedly, the defendant pretended to agree but secretly stole the previously written note and left, never to return. On December 26th, she discovered that the defendant resided at No. 32, Yongqing Lane, Dagulu, and went there. She met the defendant, but unexpectedly, the defendant already had a wife and children. His wife was even pregnant and awaiting childbirth, so she aggressively drove her away. A dream of spring, only now did she wake up. Upon investigation, the defendant's actions actually violated Article 244 of the Criminal Law and should be severely punished. Moreover, he should be ordered to pay 8,000 yuan in living expenses, etc. Judge Wu reviewed the statement and ordered that the case be rescheduled for the afternoon of the 30th, waiting for the defendant to be summoned to court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xia Xinquan, a man from Ningbo, 49 years old, used to be a servant at the office of Mr. Pagmen, a Western director of the Zheng Guanghe Foreign Firm at No. 44, Fuzhou Road. In 1930, Pagmen dismissed Xia because Xia was suffering from mental illness. Xia believed that his dismissal was caused by the slander of the Chinese General Manager, Lin Chengchuan. Therefore, he often went to the foreign firm to make trouble for Lin, demanding that he be paid a monthly salary of 45 yuan. Lin, unable to bear his harassment, paid him 150 yuan on August 11, 1931. At that time, Xia's friend wrote a receipt on his behalf and guaranteed that he would no longer make trouble in the future. Unexpectedly, not long after, Xia relapsed and made trouble at Zheng Guanghe again. Lin reported him to the police, who detained him and sent him to court, which sentenced him to eight months of detention in a settlement. Recently, Xia went to Zheng Guanghe to make trouble again, and on the 21st of the month, he demanded that Lin pay him 200 yuan in living expenses and 3,000 yuan in wages for the five years he had been dismissed, to be delivered by the morning of the 25th. Otherwise, he would die with him. Lin, fearing danger, reported the matter to the General Police Station, and the captain ordered Chinese detectives Che Xuehui and Wu Chunrong to wait at the foreign firm on the morning of the 25th. At 11:15 AM, Xia came as expected and said that 3,000 yuan was not enough, he wanted 6,000 yuan to settle the matter. The detectives arrested him and took him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, prosecuting him for attempted extortion by intimidation under Article 370, Section 3 of the Criminal Law. Then, Lin Chengchuan submitted a petition detailing the events. The defendant was questioned and confessed that his business was dismissed due to the plaintiff's slander, so he demanded to maintain his livelihood or be introduced to a job. The plaintiff agreed to introduce him to a job, so he often went to inquire and did not make trouble. He admitted to demanding 3,000 yuan, etc. Judge Qian Hongye asked if he had suffered from mental illness. He replied that he had recovered. Judge Qian then announced the verdict, sentencing Xia to two months imprisonment for attempted extortion by intimidation as a warning.</p>

<p>The Hearing Was Held Yesterday for Investigation and Interrogation</p>
<p>The Judge Ordered a Ban on Audience</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a 43-year-old man from Hangzhou residing at No. 147, Baxianfangkou, Huagenie Road, French Concession, who performed comic song and dance dramas at the rooftop garden of the Xin Xin Company, was reported to the French Police Station for raping his 19-year-old cousin, Yi Baozhu. After the detectives arrested Yi, they also discovered that Yi had also defiled his 13-year-old aunt, Li Xiaozhen, and had also bought women Ye Jinzhu and Yang Lingmei, making them learn opera and monitoring their freedom of movement. The police station escorted Yi to the Special Court No. 2, prosecuting him for three crimes: obscenity, domestic, and freedom. During the trial, the obscenity part was withdrawn by the plaintiffs, and the court then concluded the trial for the domestic and freedom cases, sentencing Yi Fangshuo to three years of imprisonment for illegally depriving others of their freedom of movement, while the obscenity case was not accepted and the domestic case was acquitted. Subsequently, Yi, dissatisfied with the verdict, raised reasons and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Based on the petition, the High Court, at noon yesterday, opened the Third Court with Judge Sun Honglin and clerk Huang Lixiang, ordering the appellant Yi Fangshuo to be brought to the case for investigation and interrogation. Because the case involved important secrets, it was announced that no audience would be allowed, and bailiffs and court clerks were also ordered to leave the courtroom. The interrogation lasted about half an hour before the court adjourned. Yi was still returned to the detention center to await a scheduled retrial.</p>

<p>Secretly Abandon the Child's Body</p>
<p>Neighbors Report to Police for Arrest</p>
<p>Zhou Chen, a 37-year-old woman from Ningbo residing at No. 97, Mujiagou, South Head of Hujia Bridge, Pudong, suddenly lost her three-year-old son on the afternoon of the 25th. Zhou abandoned the body in the fields, intending to conceal it. Unexpectedly, this morning, six of the woman's neighbors, Lu Bangmei, Zhang Jinkui, Lu Huofu, Tang Tingkang, Huang Bingkui, and Jiang Laiyou, jointly submitted a report to the Tangqiao Police Station, stating that Zhou Chen was naturally foolish and very superstitious, claiming that her three-year-old son clashed with his parents and that keeping him would be unlucky. Therefore, she wantonly abused him, which was unbearable to witness. The child was beaten to death by Chen on the 25th of this month, and the body was secretly abandoned in the wilderness, intending to cover up the traces. However, everyone in the street knew about it. The plaintiffs were all neighbors and knew about her abuse. For the sake of maintaining humanity, they specifically requested the police station to arrest the defendant Zhou Chen, etc. Director Huang approved the statement and sent the police to retrieve the child's body from the Yizhongdi in the west head of Hujia Bridge, estimating that the location of the abandoned body was about half a mile away from the defendant's home. Then he returned to the station to report. The director believed that the matter was indeed confirmed, and the woman actually believed in the destiny of conflicting fate, and cruelly used such methods against her own son, which was particularly hateful. Therefore, Chen was arrested and escorted to the local court for interrogation. The child's body was handed over to the local security to guard and reported to the court for inspection.</p>

<p>The draft budget for the International Volunteer Corps for this year was submitted to the Municipal Council on the 23rd. The commander of the Volunteer Corps originally intended to increase the use of two lower-ranking military officers to serve as battalion adjutants in order to enrich the training. After the Council decided to increase the use of one officer, it was discussed for a long time whether the training of the members should be carried out by formal military officers or by volunteer officers, and the opinions were quite divided. Under the provisional expenses this year, the remaining 9,000 yuan for the construction of staff residences and the remaining 5,500 yuan for the expansion of the garage were approved for allocation. For the recurring expenses, in addition to the additional battalion adjutant, the rest will be negotiated and finalized by the commander and the chief financial officer. Half of the original 16,000 yuan listed for bullets can be deducted. This budget案 (proposal) has now been submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Secret Plot to Blow Up Shun'an Steamer Trial Begins <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Ship Owner Ouyang Tai and Zheng Akang Both Granted Bail</p>
<p>Further Investigation of the Case and Summoning of Witnesses Are Required for Retrial</p>
<p>The Shun'an steamer of the Shun'an Steamer Company, which travels to and from Xinghua, Fujian, etc., departed from Shanghai on September 13th of last year, loaded with goods and set sail for Fujian. When it arrived at Sanduwo, Fujian, the ship owner Ouyang Tai reported to the customs there that Chen Youbai, the manager of the company, secretly instructed to blow up the steamer in order to claim insurance money. Because he could not bear the innocent sacrifice of all lives on board, he reported this matter, etc. After receiving the report, the customs detained the ship and cargo and sent Ouyang Tai to the Minhou Local Court for detention. Zheng Zhongwu, the chairman of the Shun'an Company, also learned of the previous situation and was greatly shocked. He immediately reported to the police station, and on the night of September 24th, Chen Youbai was arrested inside the Beifang Steamer Company on Fadama Road and sent to the Second Special District Court. Due to the issue of jurisdiction, Chen Youbai was transferred to the Nanshi Local Court. Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia questioned him, detained him, and sent the police to the Minhou Local Court in Fujian to transfer Ouyang Tai to Shanghai. After several interrogations and investigations, the case was clarified, and a prosecution was filed in the Criminal Court. Chen Youbai was ordered to provide a 3,000 yuan surety to be released on bail awaiting instructions, and Ouyang Tai was returned to detention. The details have been reported previously. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Judge Chen Jingyi specially opened the 13th Court for a continued hearing. First, Zheng Zhongwu's younger brother, Zheng Akang, 19 years old, from Xinghua, Fujian, currently a student, testified. Question: Why did you return to Fujian on September 13th of last year? Answer: Because my father died, I took the Shun'an steamer back to my hometown to handle the funeral. Question: Did your brother Zhongwu instruct you to go back? Answer: No. Question: What happened when the steamer left the port? Answer: In the middle of the journey, I was lonely on the ship, so I chatted with the ship owner Ouyang Tai. He said, "If the steamer unfortunately encounters danger and breaks and sinks, are you afraid?" I replied at the time, "I haven't practiced swimming, of course I'm afraid." Question: Was there anything else? Answer: On the second day (i.e., the morning of the 14th), after I got up, I walked around by myself and went to the ship owner's room. I saw many crew members talking in the room. When they saw me coming, most of them were silent. Seeing the opportunity, I withdrew and asked the old captain if there was a meeting. He replied that they were planning to blow up the steamer. Question: Since you knew about this major change, why did you change to another ship after the ship docked at Sanduwo? Answer: Because I was in a hurry to handle my father's funeral. Question: What is your relationship with Chen Youbai? Answer: None. After the interrogator finished, he ordered Ouyang Tai, who was in custody, to be brought to the case. He asked, "You said last time that Zheng Akang prevented you from telegraphing to Shanghai, destroyed the telegraph machine, and forced you to blow up the ship. Now, according to Zheng Akang's testimony, this is not the case. What is the situation?" Answer: "Zheng Akang pressured me, and he convened a meeting of the crew on the ship, requiring that the ship must be blown up. He also publicly promised that after the matter was completed, he would pay each person a year's salary." Question: "The motive for blowing up the ship was discussed by Chen Youbai and you. Why did Chen Youbai order Zheng Akang to board the ship to supervise? Moreover, Zheng Akang is Zheng Zhongwu's brother. According to this situation, it does not conform to the facts and reason." Answer: "Zheng Akang relied on the power of his brother Zheng Zhongwu, who is the chairman of the board, so he came to pressure me to blow up the ship. Because I was unwilling to do something that would lose my conscience, when the ship docked at Sanduwo, I reported the situation to the customs." They harbored resentment and framed me. I request the court to investigate clearly. Finally, the manager of the Hehai Insurance Company gave a statement. The judge said that further investigation and summoning of witnesses were necessary in this case. A continued hearing will be held again. Chen Youbai will still be released on his original bail, and Ouyang Tai will be released on a 5,000 yuan surety. Zheng Akang will also be released on a reliable surety pending instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Discussion on Improving Ambulance Sirens <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The sirens used by the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade's ambulances have been considered disruptive by some. The Police Committee recently reported that it has instructed the Fire Brigade Chief to pay attention to this matter. It is claimed that this type of siren is used in the United States and Canada and is effective in ensuring the rapid passage of ambulances. Other types of sirens are easily confused. Currently, tests are being conducted to add a reflector to direct the siren sound forward to allow pedestrians to give way. Committee members stated that the siren's design inevitably disturbs patients in the vehicle, and quietness should be prioritized over speed. The Fire Brigade Chief has taken this into account and instructed drivers to be mindful.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Publication of the Fourth Issue of the Anhui Series <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The complete fourth issue of the Anhui Series is a compilation of the posthumous works of Ling Tingkan, collected by the Anhui Series Compilation and Printing Office, and is collectively titled "Mr. Ling Cizhong's Posthumous Works." It includes 13 volumes of "Explanations of Ritual Classics," 6 volumes of "Origins of Yanyue Music," 1 volume of "Corrections of Flute Temperament Errors," 2 volumes of "Chronological Biography of Yuan Yishan," 14 volumes of "Xiaolitang Poetry Collection," 36 volumes of "Literary Collection," 2 volumes of "Plum Blossom Flute Score," and 2 volumes of "Appendix: Chronological Biography of Mr. Ling," totaling 78 volumes, bound into 26 large books, all exquisitely printed on domestic Lianshi paper. Ling Tingkan, courtesy name Cizhong, alternate name Zhongzi, was a native of She County and a Jinshi graduate in the Qianlong Gengxu year. He served as a professor at the Ningguo Prefectural School. In his youth, he was friends with Wang Zhong, Ruan Yuan, Jiao Xun, Jiang Fan, and others. When Huang Wenyang proofread Ci and Qu music, Mr. Ling assisted him. He also studied under Weng Fanggang, delving into the study of classics and history, and developing the ideas of Jiang Yong, Dai Zhen, and Jin Cheng. He was skilled in the interpretation of rites, seeking examples and analyzing words. His explanations were clear, and he sought truth through corroborating evidence, correcting old theories. He can be considered a reliable source for the study of ancient Chinese culture and social history. As for acoustics, philology, the Nine Chapters, and the Eight Lines, he reached their extremes. He was particularly knowledgeable about musical temperament, distinguishing between palace tones and northern and southern tunes, and wrote "Origins of Yanyue Music." The discussions in his literary collection also largely focused on this. He was truly a master of music, temperament, Ci and Qu music of the Qing Dynasty. In poetry, he did not distinguish between the Tang and Song schools, but his talent and knowledge were abundant, and his style was vigorous and lofty, closely resembling Yishan. His Ci music also did not adhere to any single school, but he was strict with musical temperament. If a single word was not in harmony, he would seek to correct it. His prose was skilled in parallelism, attaining the purity of the Han and Wei dynasties and the beauty of the Six Dynasties, surpassing Hu Zhiwei and Kong Guangxuan. He immersed himself in historical studies and was familiar with anecdotes, as seen in his collection. Jiang Fan praised his profound historical knowledge, saying that only Qian Zhuting, Shao Eryun, Li Xiaochen, and Wang Rongfu could be compared to him. The Xiaolitang Collection is extremely rare and sought after by scholars. Now that it has been printed by the Anhui Series Compilation and Printing Office, its popularity can be foreseen.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Pig Boat and Wooden Boat Collide in Storm <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Fifteen Crew Members Lost at Sea</p>
<p>Qin Ziyi, a pig merchant from Jiangbei, recently purchased over 700 pigs in the Lusi area and hired Zhang Yuanhe's boat to transport them to Shanghai for sale through commission agencies. As the Lunar New Year approached, the demand for pigs in Shanghai was very high. On the 21st of this month, Qin handed the pigs over to Zhang to load onto the boat and urged Zhang to rush to Shanghai for early sale. Qin entrusted his 60-year-old father to escort the shipment. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, while sailing in the waters outside Sanjia, Chongming East Sea, the wind became very strong, and waves crashed against the boat. Qin's father, seeing this, feared danger and urged Zhang to take shelter in port. He ordered the helmsman to quickly steer towards the Chongming coast for berthing. While turning the helm, a wave crashed against the boat, and the main mast in the middle of Zhang's boat was broken by the wind, causing a loss of steering ability. The boat drifted with the wind. The crew shouted for help, but the sea was vast, and no ships came to their rescue. Later, the boat was washed by waves to the Chuansha waters. At that time, the Ningbo sand boat Fang Anyu, fully loaded with timber, was speeding by. Due to the darkness and night, they did not notice each other. When Zhang's boat crashed straight ahead, it was close to Fang's boat. They shouted for help upon seeing each other. Fang's boat heard the sound and was about to avoid it, but the two boats had already collided. Zhang's boat capsized instantly, and all 18 people on board fell into the water. The bow of Fang's boat was also damaged, and three crew members working on the deck were knocked off. They immediately stopped the boat to rescue them, but due to the darkness, strong winds, and high waves, rescue was difficult. They rescued four of Zhang's boat's crew and two of their own crew. The whereabouts of the rest were unknown. Yesterday, Fang's boat sailed to Wusong and anchored, giving money to the rescued crew of Zhang's boat to send them to Shanghai. However, Qin, upon receiving the news and learning that his father had not returned, cried loudly. He was persuaded to stop by friends and immediately hired a boat to go to the scene of the accident to search for bodies. It is said that Fang's boat needs repairs before it can sail again.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Lawsuit over Purchase of American Cotton Futures <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Losses Due to Continuous Drop in Cotton Prices and Failure to Add Margin</p>
<p>Defendant Claims Plaintiff's Short Selling Borders on Gambling</p>
<p>Gu Cheng Lian, a native of Nanxun, successively placed orders with the American trading firm Meisheng Foreign Firm for 1,000 bales of American cotton futures and 25,000 baskets of American wheat futures between August and September of last year. Three contracts were drawn up, specifying the prices. The contracts stipulated that if the prices fell below the agreed-upon purchase price within the agreed-upon period, Gu would have to pay a margin equal to the difference in the purchase price. Otherwise, the seller would settle the accounts at any time based on the market price of American cotton and wheat, and any losses would be borne by the buyer. After the contracts were established, Gu paid a margin of 7,200 yuan. Unexpectedly, cotton and wheat prices began to fall, and Meisheng requested an increase in the margin, but Gu ignored the request. The foreign firm then abruptly closed all accounts on November 17th, before the goods were due, claiming a total loss of 14,928 yuan and 83 cents and demanding compensation from Gu. Unable to resolve the dispute, they filed a lawsuit for damages in the First Special District District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong opened the court to summon the parties for questioning. The plaintiff's representative lawyers, Fei Si, Lu Congzu, stated the plaintiff's case, roughly stating that the plaintiff is a member of the New York Cotton Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, as well as a member of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The defendant signed two contracts with the plaintiff on August 29th and September 4th of last year to purchase American cotton, one for 600 bales at a price of 13.38 cents per pound and one for 400 bales at a price of</p>
<p>13.22 cents per pound. The delivery dates were set for December and March. Subsequently, on September 8th, another contract was signed for the purchase of 25,000 baskets of American wheat, priced at $1.07 and 5/8 per basket, with December as the delivery date. It was agreed that the plaintiff would purchase the goods on Gu's behalf from the New York and Chicago exchanges. The contract specified that the defendant should deposit a down payment, known as the margin, upon the delivery of the goods. It further stipulated that if the price of the goods fell to a certain level, the margin would have to be increased. Subsequently, the prices of the goods fell steadily. "The plaintiff repeatedly notified the defendant to pay the margin, and the defendant initially paid 7,200 yuan on October 4th. However, this amount was</p>
<p>significantly different from the amount requested by the plaintiff. A letter was sent to the defendant on November 13th, requesting that an additional 19,000 yuan be paid before 3:00 PM on the same day. Otherwise, the cotton and wheat would have to be resold, and any losses would be borne by the defendant. However, the defendant continued to ignore the request, and the two goods were completely resold on November 15th, resulting in a loss of over 14,000 yuan, which should be compensated according to the contract. These are all established facts, which the defendant should not deny. The reason that the defendant relies on is that this transaction is purely short selling, similar to gambling, which is a far-fetched argument." The defendant's lawyer, Yang Linzhi, then replied, stating that there was no dispute over the facts of the case, except that the bill presented by the plaintiff only listed</p>
<p>the purchase price but not the sale price, so the difference could not be recognized. However, this point was not the defendant's main defense. What the defendant emphasized was that all three contracts contained a gambling nature and were essentially a form of short selling. For example, 1) the contract stated that the cotton and wheat were purchased from the American exchange and were subject to American law, which was clearly different from a normal purchase contract. 2) The rise and fall of the price of the goods was based on the market price of the American exchange. 3) Despite the long-term order, the contract did not specify the period for shipment and arrival, or the quality of the goods. 4) What the buyer paid was not a down payment but a margin. 5) If the price of the goods fell,</p>
<p>an additional margin would have to be added. 6) If the additional margin was not paid, the account would be settled according to the market price. 7) The amount of the loss would also be based on the rise and fall of the market price. 8) The calculation of profits and losses was based on the price in U.S. dollars. 9) The contract contained the phrase "the intention to actually deliver the goods." If the goods were actually delivered upon expiration, why would this footnote be necessary? It was even more evident that it was a cover-up. In addition, two of the three contracts were due in December, while one was due as late as March of this year. However, the plaintiff's settlement was in November, far from the due date. If the defendant asked for the goods upon expiration, how would the plaintiff respond? Therefore, even if the plaintiff wanted to settle the account, it should have been done after the due date. Now the loss being pursued, even if it is not</p>
<p>short selling, is difficult to acknowledge, let alone the fact that it is indeed a gambling act of short selling. This kind of illegal transaction violates our country's mandatory regulations. Since the plaintiff is neither an exchange nor a broker, how can it operate the business of an exchange? Articles 16 and 40 of our country's Exchange Law are very clear. It should be declared that the three contracts in dispute in this case are invalid, etc." The plaintiff's lawyer immediately refuted the defendant's reasons for defense, stating that the defendant's accusation of violating mandatory regulations was a misunderstanding by the defendant, and stated that transactions of the same nature between Chinese and foreign businesses are happening in this city every day, and do not necessarily involve the Exchange Law. The defendant is now using the excuse of short selling to avoid liability for damages because of losses. However, trade always has profits and losses. If a loss is said to be gambling, it is tantamount to deceiving oneself and others. Judge Shen said that this case was quite complicated, and the plaintiff should submit a list of the sale prices of the goods, and then adjourned the hearing for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Telegram to the Central Government from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union received a letter yesterday from the Preparatory Committee of the Changsha National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union requesting assistance. The union has been persecuted by the trade association. The details of the letter to the central government are as follows: The Changsha Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union was approved by the Changsha Municipal Party Headquarters in September of last year to launch preparations. Just as it was actively underway, the trade association filed a petition with the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting its dissolution, which caused a dispute. The Municipal Party Headquarters, concerned about the escalation of the situation, submitted a request to the province for instructions, not daring to act independently, and requested instructions from the central government. As a result, the union dispatched plenipotentiary petitioners Chen Bingwen and Xu Shuyou to Beijing to petition and repeatedly telegraphed the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union for assistance. The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, feeling that their interests were at stake, could not bear to sit idly by and telegraphed the central government yesterday. An excerpt is recorded below: The Nanjing Central Executive Committee's Mass Movement Guidance Committee, From repeated letters and telegrams from the Preparatory Committee of the Changsha National Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, it is reported that the association was illegally obstructed by the local National Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Association during the approved preparatory period, persecuting the labor movement and conspiring to sabotage it. Please provide public justice assistance. Upon review of the facts, the fault lies with the trade association. Since the Changsha Municipal Party Headquarters approved the organization in advance, how can the trade association stop it? If the facts are presented, where will the Party's credibility be placed? Once this trend starts, it will inevitably become a bad example. Our association's interests are at stake, and we cannot remain silent. Because the case has already been submitted by the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters to your committee for verification, we dare not overstep our bounds and state the truth directly. Hoping for your wise judgment, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union respectfully bows. Sleeps.</p>

<p>Thoroughly Ban Giveaways</p>
<p>The Yuan Fengrun Company, a member of the Shanghai Candle Industry Association, was previously punished by the Social Bureau for violating regulations on giveaways, and the association published a notice in the newspaper. However, the company's giveaway signs have not been automatically removed. The association believes that since the company has been punished for violating regulations, it should not be allowed to continue giveaways and disrupt the market. The above actions are obviously deliberate violations and contempt for the bureau's orders. It is reported that the Social Bureau has been telegraphed to promptly dispatch personnel to forcibly remove the signs in order to show its authority and achieve thoroughness. As for other minority colleagues who are also violating regulations, evidence is being collected and submitted to the bureau to be punished accordingly.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern, The news in your newspaper on the 24th about the Qimen Tea Industry Improvement Farm borrowing money from the Shanghai Bank is completely fabricated.

It is now planning to purchase large-scale tea-making machinery and build a new-style tea factory. The funds are all allocated by the Economic Commission and have no loan relationship with the Shanghai Bank. Please correct this. Sincerely, Qimen Tea Industry Improvement Farm, Shanghai Agency.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Preliminary Discussion on Amending the Current Trademark Law Xu Chao <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Introduction, After the National Government promulgated the Trademark Law in May of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the public was confused. The industrial and commercial circles, due to their own vital interests and the special circumstances of our country's society, had to conduct an in-depth review. In November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Judicial Yuan explained in a court order that the text used in the trademark in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the current Trademark Law does not include pronunciation. At that time, public opinion was in an uproar. Those who successively expressed their opinions, such as Chen Xuyuan, Hu Xiyuan, Pan Yang'an, Li Wenjie, Qin Yanzhao, etc., all believed that the defects of the current Trademark Law were even more blatant. In June of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Member Representatives Congress, I, in my capacity as an attending representative, proposed to the Congress to organize a Trademark Law Research Committee, sincerely because the current Trademark Law has been implemented for more than two years, and it is not very suitable for the current situation of industry and commerce. It is urgent to gather leaders from the industrial and commercial circles to contribute opinions to the legislators with the views of the majority. In December of the same year, Director He of the Trademark Bureau, based on his experience in handling cases, published an article entitled "My Humble Opinion on Amending the Current Trademark Law," explaining the shortcomings with righteous words and solemn expressions. We then knew that the legislative authorities did have the determination to amend the current Trademark Law. The Trademark Bureau authorities have already received instructions from the Industrial Department of the Executive Yuan to draft an amendment to the Trademark Law and submit it to the ministry for review. Then, based on our own interests, it is even more urgent to list our opinions. Therefore, we will conduct a separate review as follows: (1) Pronunciation Issues, The text of a trademark was originally registered to highlight the products manufactured by oneself, to develop them, and to hope to obtain the protection of exclusive rights. The so-called "distinctive" is nothing more than to make it easier for buyers to identify them and avoid confusion. If it is really as explained by the Judicial Yuan, then "Ajinomoto" and "Ajijin", "Fish Head" and "Jade Hand" can be registered separately. What is the meaning of the Trademark Law protecting the exclusive right to a trademark? According to the legislative intent, is it like this? However, our country has a vast territory and a large population. Across a mountain or a river, dialects are different. Let alone Beijing and Guangdong, Shanghai and Hankou, commercial ports, and industrial and commercial gatherings, disputes involving trademarks including pronunciation are still difficult to avoid. In my opinion, after amending Paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the current Trademark Law, add a paragraph, "The text used in the trademark includes pronunciation, but it is based on the national pronunciation of each country." (2) Classification Issues, National legislation should first suit national conditions. Our country's industry is backward and has been miserably invaded and oppressed by capitalists for more than a year. The Trademark Law is a law to protect industry, how should it take into account the national economy and have the spirit of encouragement? The current Trademark Law's strict classification is contrary to the principle of protecting industry. Industry is divided into heavy and light industries. The Trademark Bureau is not a tax revenue agency. What is the point of detailed classification? For example, Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Implementation Rules, in addition to the categories of chemicals, medicines, and western medicines, lists resins, glues, mineral springs, salts, and chemical products, which are no less than thousands of kinds. If they are listed in this way, can they be complete? What is the difference between dyes and pigments in the second item? What is the difference between paint, oil, ink, and coatings? What is the difference between stone or its imitation in Item 12 and stone and artificial stone? How can Item 15 distinguish between glass and its products and glass materials? According to Item 29, linen yarn is classified as one category, and rayon yarn is also classified as one category. Then, cotton yarn and cotton thread in Item 27 and wool yarn and wool thread in Item 28 can be merged. Logically speaking, the capital of heavy industry is larger, and complicated classification is still acceptable. Light industry or even handicrafts have small capital, and detailed classification is overwhelming. How should it be summarized and merged? The responsibility lies with the legislators. Let us try to be aware of the immaturity of domestic industry and the decline of the national economy. If we can expand exclusive rights to similar commodities without being limited to the same commodity, then there will be more opportunities to promote our country's industrial future. (3) Issues of Priority of Use, Our country's Trademark Law adopts the principle of first use. Since its legislation, it has been in effect for many years and still feels suitable for national conditions. However, in the past, our country's merchants had a weaker concept of registration. According to the latest survey, since the establishment of the Trademark Bureau, approximately 20,000 trademark registrations have been made, and Chinese only account for a quarter. The weakness of the concept is self-evident. According to Article 3 of the current Trademark Law, when two or more people apply for registration of the same or similar trademarks for the same commodity, the actual first user shall be allowed to register. Also, according to Article 4 of the same law, when a trademark that has been continuously used in good faith for more than ten years is submitted for registration in accordance with this law, it is not subject to the restrictions of Article 2, Article 6, and Item 3. The good intentions of the latter article are self-evident. However, our countrymen's emphasis on registration should be a fact in recent years. It is difficult to make preferential treatment universal. The history of our country's industry is less than 50 years, while looking around at the developed machinery of various countries, it has reached its peak. Now, with its long history in its own country, it is competing with our country for a day's length. Our harm is endless. Moreover, our countrymen's thinking is not necessarily behind others. The accidental coincidence of trademarks cannot be said to be a rare fact. A fair solution would be to add the seven words "within the Republic of China" to the phrase "actual first user" in the original text of Article 3. (4) Conclusion, There are many people who argue that the current Trademark Law should be amended. In addition to the above three points, the Trademark Bureau's issuance of appraisal certificates is not legally based. If merchants change or add additional notes to registered trademarks to use them for insinuation, the Trademark Bureau may impose a revocation penalty. However, if the Trademark Bureau itself changes or adds additional notes to approved trademarks to insinuate, the Trademark Bureau cannot take action to prohibit them. The urgency of adding clauses to these two points is self-evident. In particular, I have even more to say. According to current practice, when applying for registration of a trademark for a drug, a chemical verification certificate from the Central Health Administration must be attached. If the same trademark is used for hundreds of drugs, it will be necessary to wait until all hundreds of drugs have been verified and certified before the registration can be submitted. The delay in time is secondary. The chemical verification fee for each drug is 25 yuan. Hundreds of drugs require no less than tens of thousands of dollars. A small pharmaceutical merchant will use all of his funds for chemical verification and it will not be enough. How can he register a trademark? Chemical verification of drugs is a way to ban drugs, while trademark registration is to protect the exclusive rights of merchants. How can they be discussed together? For the sake of the future of the national industry and commerce, it is hoped that the administrative authorities will not require chemical verification as a condition for drug registration in order to facilitate the process. Then the future of industry and commerce will be fortunate. In summary, this letter is lengthy and I dare not say that the review is thorough. I am casting a brick to attract jade, and I really hope that there will be virtuous people in the country.</p>

<p>Report on the Conference and Express Their Thoughts</p>
<p>Chiang Meng-lin and Liu Chan-en reported on their attendance at the East Asia Higher Education Conference, stating: "We respectfully report that the University of the Philippines and the Higher Education Association of the Philippines initiated the East Asia Higher Education Conference to exchange views and strengthen ties, and invited our country to participate. Meng-lin and Chan-en were dispatched by the Ministry to attend the conference. We departed from Shanghai on December 12th of the 23rd year and arrived in Hong Kong. Dr. Chen Jung-chieh, the representative of Lingnan University, boarded the ship and accompanied us. The conference was held from December 18th to 21st for four consecutive days in Manila. In addition to the representatives from our country, there were two representatives from Japan and over a hundred representatives from the Philippines. There were no formal resolutions passed during the conference. The discussions, such as the purpose of universities, curriculum teaching, etc., were mostly related to higher education in the Philippines. However, one group specifically studied international education, emphasizing that the friendship between China and the Philippines is already profound and should be further strengthened. It was hoped that China and the Philippines would exchange faculty and students more frequently in the future to implement cultural exchange. During the general assembly, Meng-lin delivered a speech on 'Higher Education in China,' Chan-en delivered a speech on 'New Trends in Education in China,' and Chen Jung-chieh delivered a speech on 'Education and Humanity.' After the conference, we were invited by Philippine leaders and our overseas Chinese compatriots to visit Iloilo, Baguio, and other places, and were warmly welcomed and entertained by all sectors. We gave over twenty speeches. We left the Philippines and returned to China on January 2nd of this year. We respectfully submit the following brief report on our thoughts on this trip. As for the educational situation, the Philippines has placed great emphasis on education since being governed by Americans for over thirty years. There is one national university on the island, with over six thousand students, six or seven private universities with over ten thousand students, one hundred and twenty middle schools with five thousand eight hundred students, and one thousand five hundred and fifty-five elementary schools with one million one hundred and twenty-one thousand and twenty-eight students. There are one thousand five hundred and forty-one middle school teachers and twenty-four thousand and seventy-six elementary school teachers. With a population of thirteen million, there is one elementary school teacher for every five hundred and thirty-nine residents, and one middle school teacher for every eight thousand five hundred and sixty-five residents. The current system is seven years of elementary school, four years of middle school, and four years of university. Its teaching methods are quite adapted to the needs of individual students and society, with particular emphasis on compulsory education. Every village has at least one school, and the facilities and buildings are in accordance with government regulations and are completely uniform. Two-thirds of school-age children have entered school, so its education is quite widespread. As for its funding, the central government allocates 40% to education, the provinces allocate 40% to 60% to education, and the local governments supplement it with one-third of the total education funding from the central and provincial governments. Because its education funding is abundant, its educational facilities can be actively developed, resulting in today's achievements. (2) As for the government, commerce, and people's lives, the Philippines' politics emphasizes a centralized system. Through years of effort, the United States has approved its full independence after ten years. A constitutional conference is currently being held to prepare for the organization of a new government. Due to the clarity of its politics and the meticulousness of its finances, its commerce is also very developed. The main trades on the island are sugar and coconut oil. A total of 720,000 people in the country are engaged in the sugar industry, with an annual output of 483,025,069 Philippine pesos. 1,147,000 people are engaged in the coconut oil industry, with an annual output of 200,000,000 Philippine pesos. In terms of foreign trade, the surplus in 1929 was 623,214,234 Philippine pesos. Although the world economy was sluggish in 1933, the surplus was still able to maintain 349,466,331 Philippine pesos, so its economic foundation is still solid. The country's income increases annually. In 1918, it was 4,371,338,000 Philippine pesos. In 1926, it was 6,035,152,000 Philippine pesos. In 1933, it was 6,676,876,000 Philippine pesos. As for the people's lives, due to the unique natural advantages and abundant resources, food and fruit are everywhere. With a little effort, they can be well-fed and clothed. Moreover, clothing and housing are simple, so the problem of livelihood is not difficult to solve. Everyone lives and works in peace and contentment, and there is little fear of hunger and cold. (3) The situation of overseas Chinese. There are approximately 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, mostly from Fukien Province, followed by Kwangtung Province. Their history is long, dating back to before the arrival of the Spanish in the Philippines during the Ming Dynasty. They are engaged in commerce, such as food and groceries, and occupy a dominant position locally. The trade with the motherland exports 1,600,000 Philippine pesos and imports 10,000,000 Philippine pesos. In recent years, more enlightened overseas Chinese have paid more attention to the education of their children, and are keen to cultivate specialized commercial talents and improve their commercial knowledge in order to maintain the superior commercial position of overseas Chinese in the Philippines for 300-400 years. However, due to the impact of the world's economic downturn, they are inevitably somewhat financially constrained. It is therefore necessary to guide them according to the situation and strive for unity. The above are rough sketches. In short, the Philippines is a newly emerging country with vigor and vitality, and its future is limitless. The relationship between China and the Philippines is profound and their friendship is strong. In the future, we should strive to be friendly and support each other, thereby establishing a foundation for peace in the Far East and ensuring the lives of more than 100,000 overseas Chinese living there. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Education, Chiang Meng-lin, President of National Peking University, Liu Chan-en, President of Private Shanghai University."</p>
<h3 id="e186">Chen Lifu and Others' Opinions on the Ten Professors' Manifesto <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ten Professors' Manifesto was published, many academic leaders and party and government authorities in China have expressed their support. Yesterday, Chen Lifu, a member of the Central Committee, and Luo Tingguang, Dean of the Hupeh Public Education College, Li Denghui, President of Fudan University, and Zheng Zhenduo, Professor of Tsinghua University, also expressed their opinions. They are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu's Opinion. Chen Lifu, a member of the Central Committee, paid exceptional attention to the Ten Principles. Recently, Chen wrote to a friend, stating, "The construction of a Chinese-based culture has been the proposition he has continued to strive for in the past year. If there is an opportunity in the future, he will strongly promote it to become a new Chinese cultural movement." It is also heard that Chen is currently drafting a lengthy article expressing his views on the construction of a Chinese-based culture.</p>
<p>Luo Tingguang's Opinion. Luo Tingguang, Dean of the Hupeh Public Education College, passed through Shanghai today on his way to Europe to further investigate education. He expressed his support for the Ten Professors' Manifesto, stating, "Cultural construction is extremely important. What I pay most attention to during this overseas investigation is the cultural construction situation in European countries, especially the so-called cultural elements of the United Kingdom, as well as the national characteristics and causes of national revival in continental countries. If I gain any insights in the future, I will contribute them as much as possible for reference."</p>
<p>Li Denghui's Opinion. Li Denghui, President of Fudan University, specifically expressed his opinion on this issue, stating: "To engage sincerely in cultural construction, it is necessary to examine the general trend of the world. The trend of world culture today can be said to be moving towards harmony and mixture, that is, cultures of various nations and countries, as a result of mutual contact, influence each other, modify each other, and supplement each other, gradually producing a new culture with a global nature. The most concrete example is architecture. The architecture of the West in ancient times was already a mixture of various architectures of Greece, Rome, Egypt, and the emerging Nordic peoples. Recently, Chinese and Indian architecture has been harmonized with Western architecture, becoming the most magnificent structure that no single original architecture can match. Just as architecture is like this, all cultures are also like this. When we build a new Chinese culture, we should not pick up the leftovers of other countries, nor should we stick to our own established methods. We must identify the advantages of Western culture and adopt them, and identify the advantages of our old culture and preserve them. When the two sides are brought together and then smelted in one furnace, a brilliant new culture can be produced. Now we are standing at a crossroads. We do not know what to do with the things of others and our own. At one time, we blindly worshiped the West, and at another time, we turned around and excessively exaggerated ourselves, and even abandoned our own essence and picked up the dross of others. These are all very dangerous. Fortunately, in recent years, the Chinese people's ability to discern seems to be improving day by day. I very much hope that the Ten Professors' Manifesto can arouse everyone to conduct more detailed research, analysis, investigation, and comparison, and ultimately be able to select, eliminate, and create a new culture that runs through China and the West. Furthermore, speaking of China's current urgent needs, although everyone attaches great importance to material construction, there is indeed a need to quickly find ways to relieve the people's livelihoods. I also very much agree with this, but I think that spiritual construction is especially important. If material construction is to succeed, it must be presided over by a full spirit. What the Chinese people lack most is enthusiasm. Because without enthusiasm, it is difficult to unite and sacrifice, and the sins of selfishness, cowardice, and corruption are also prone to occur. These are all great enemies of material construction. If these great enemies are not eliminated, then material construction is also very likely to become an opportunity for private enrichment, and most people will still not be able to enjoy happiness. Therefore, promoting inherent morality and the New Life Movement can both be said to be important plans for spiritual construction. However, I personally feel that the power of religion should also be fully utilized to inspire the enthusiasm of the Chinese people."</p>
<p>Zheng Zhenduo's Opinion. Zheng Zhenduo, Professor of Tsinghua University, took the opportunity of his visit to Shanghai to express his support for the Ten Professors' Manifesto, stating, "I think that while cultural issues are indeed important, how the Chinese nation itself can survive is an even bigger issue. If Japan's claws are forever gripping China, China will never have the possibility of revival. The problem now is how to enable China to escape Japan's claws, so the most urgent problem is not the problem of culture, but the problem of survival. We certainly know that we can survive in a bad environment, but how to survive is always a big problem. (Omission) In China's old culture, a way out can never be found. For example, national medicine and national health movements are just acts in the prelude to national subjugation. The survival of the Chinese nation must be entrusted to a new culture and a new organization. How to organize the masses and how to make the masses have a conscious fighting spirit for survival is today's urgent task, while restoring the old culture is a dead end."</p>

<p>The Shanghai team, which is about to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong to attend the Interport Football Competition, held a practice match against the Western Police yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Shen Garden in order to practice and make the final selection. Interport players Ma Shan'er, Simmons, and Corcoran and Alger of the Western Police joined the Shanghai Interport Football Team.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was actually a combined team. However, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, and Wan Xianghua of the formal team did not participate because they did not intend to go to Hong Kong. With the absence of these three players, the lineup is even more sluggish. It is expected that it will be difficult to achieve good results in this trip to the south. Moreover, yesterday's performance was extremely poor and unremarkable. In a bland situation, the Shanghai team won 5-3. There were only two to three thousand spectators.</p>
<p>Disorganized Lineup: Overall, the performance of the Interport team yesterday can only be described as satisfactory by Baoshali and goalkeeper Huate. Mr. Bao performed as usual, and Huate was particularly energetic and unexpectedly comparable to Corcoran of the combined team. Li Ning missed too many opportunities and Xiu Tuo seemed more outstanding. Remidi's central defender seemed to have some shortcomings, and Chen Hongguang was prone to jittery disorder. Maida was so-so. With the absence of forwards Sun Jinshun and Dai Linjing, the entire line collapsed. Chen Jiaqiu was absent due to illness, and Li Yichen was still unable to cooperate with Bao and Ke. Greenborg's left wing was enough to replace Wan Xianghua, but Fafan on the right wing was timid, old, weak, and incompetent. It is unknown how he was selected.</p>
<p>Individual Contributions: The overall situation was dull and uninteresting, and the sudden cold weather made the audience feel even colder. In the first half, the Shanghai team won 3-1. The scorers were: 1) Lin Lasha of the Shanghai team; 2) Li Yichen of the Shanghai team; 3) Scored in the scrimmage by the combined team; 4) Baoshali of the Shanghai team. In the second half, it was 2-2. 5) Jack of the combined team; 6) Li Yichen of the Shanghai team; 7) Jack of the combined team; 8) Kelasha of the Shanghai team. The result was a 5-3 victory.</p>

<p>Score of 1.79 Meters</p>
<p>The Chinese Single Track and Field Competition Promotion Association specially invited Wu Bixian, a national high jump expert, to perform high jump at the Dongya Sports School in Lujiawan yesterday. Although the weather was freezing cold and the north wind was howling, more than 200 people still came to watch. When Mr. Wu tried the jump for the first time, he easily jumped over 1.60 meters, then raised it to 1.70 meters, and jumped over again. When it was raised to 1.79 meters, he jumped over it only after two attempts. At this time, Mr. Wu had not yet taken off his trousers. When it was raised to 1.85 meters, because the weather was very cold and the venue was not good, Mr. Wu stopped jumping. Otherwise, it would not be difficult to break the national record.</p>

<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>We must always avoid all kinds of bad environments, so that we will not be subject to all kinds of bad influences. But avoiding all kinds of bad environments is not an easy thing. We heard Mozi say: "Dyed in blue, it is blue; dyed in yellow, it is yellow." Isn't his intention the same as "Accustomed to good, it is good; accustomed to evil, it is evil"? This proves that the goodness or badness of our environment lies in how we do things on weekdays.</p>
<p>If we are in a dark and filthy environment, over time, we will inevitably become degenerate. In other words, if we are in a bright and noble environment, over time, we will naturally be influenced and subtly assimilated. Now, I can use an example to prove this:</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, Mencius was once in a bad environment in his childhood. When his mother lived next to the cemetery, he liked to do things like building tombs. Later, when he moved next to the market, he liked to do things like selling goods. This was because Mencius was in a bad environment and was thus negatively influenced. Therefore, Mencius' mother became very worried and decided to move next to the school palace. Mencius then spent his days setting up ritual vessels and practicing etiquette, gradually getting on the right track. This was because Mencius was in a good environment and was thus positively influenced. In short, the magic of the environment greatly affects people's tendencies.</p>
<p>Dear children! No matter what, you must get out of the dark and filthy environment and go into the bright and noble environment, so that you will not be negatively influenced.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Lunar and Solar Calendars <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Since Julius Caesar formulated the calendar in 46 BC, the day of the winter solstice, when the sun returns, has been the beginning of the year, which is January 1, used worldwide today. The Julian calendar takes the month of the winter solstice as January, but people often confuse it with the ancient winter solstice, New Year, and the anniversary of Christ's birth (December 25). As for the old calendar used in our country, it originated in the Xia Dynasty and is also called the Xia calendar. Because in the agricultural era, agriculture was the most important thing, the year's harvest was over, and spring and winter were divided according to the solar terms. If you look at it according to the current Gregorian calendar, it is indeed not suitable for the relationship with agricultural affairs. Therefore, most rural areas in Japan still use the lunar calendar. Although urban agencies follow the Gregorian calendar, it is only regarded as a memorial festival, which commemorates the significance of the founding of the country. In other coastal areas, the rise and fall of tides often coincide with the new and full moon of the lunar calendar, so it is more convenient to use the lunar calendar. However, the dates of the lunar calendar are easy to calculate incorrectly. Even the calculation method of the lunar age under the decimal point is different. Moreover, it only counts the days according to the waxing and waning of the moon, from new moon to new moon, from full moon to full moon, using a purely lunar calendar completely, and without considering the operation of the sun, it is inevitable that there will be differences in the seasons. Therefore, India and Japan used the lunisolar calendar to avoid seasonal errors. The method of determining the seasons in the lunar calendar is based on the waxing and waning of the moon, determining the new and full moon, with 30 days for a large month and 29 days for a small month. The winter solstice is in November, the vernal equinox is in February, the summer solstice is in May, and the autumnal equinox is in August. An intercalary month is placed in a month that does not contain the central solar term. Japan used this method to compile the calendar in the past. After the fifth year of Meiji, the Gregorian calendar was adopted. However, more than 60 years have passed, and the people in the rural areas of the country still stick to the old rules and celebrate the New Year according to the lunar calendar. This is because half of it is constrained by customs, but it is also because the season and agriculture are related and cannot be helped.</p>

<p>｜Written for the Third Anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident｜</p>
<p>The sea breeze is rustling, the river water is vast. Three years ago, we resisted here, resisted.</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Children! Do you know that all objects in the natural world can be divided into two major categories: living organisms and non-living organisms. Humans, horses, peaches, and plums are living organisms. Mountains, iron, stone, and soil are non-living organisms.</p>
<p>Living organisms can be further divided into plants and animals. Humans and plums, dogs and pines, who are animals and who are plants? There are very obvious differences:</p>
<p>1.  Cell Structure: A cell is the smallest unit that makes up the body of a living organism. If the cell membrane wrapped outside the cell is made of fiber, it is a plant. Otherwise, it is an animal.</p>
<p>2.  Method of Nutrition: Plants have green chlorophyll and rely on sunlight. The function of extracting nutrients from water and carbonic acid gas is that of a plant. Otherwise, it is an animal. In short, plants absorb inorganic matter. Animals absorb organic matter.</p>
<p>3.  Ability to Move: Plants absorb inorganic matter, which is everywhere, so they do not need to move their bodies. Animals absorb organic matter, so they must search for it, so they have to move.</p>
<p>4.  Ability to Feel: Plants do not have nerves, so there is no significant response when you touch them. Animal nerves are very sensitive. If you hit a dog, it will definitely run away quickly.</p>
<p>There are more than 233,000 species of plants. They can be divided into two major categories:</p>
<p>1.  Phanerogams (flowering): like plums and peaches.</p>
<p>2.  Cryptogams (non-flowering): like bacteria.</p>
<p>Animals can be divided into ten categories:</p>
<p>1.  Vertebrates: humans, etc.</p>
<p>2.  Arthropods: shrimp, etc.</p>
<p>3.  Mollusks: clams, etc.</p>
<p>4.  Echinoderms: sea cucumbers, etc.</p>
<p>5.  Annelids: earthworms, etc.</p>
<p>6.  Nematodes: roundworms, etc.</p>
<p>7.  Platyhelminthes: tapeworms, etc.</p>
<p>8.  Coelenterates: hydras, etc.</p>
<p>9.  Sponges: sponges, etc.</p>
<p>10. Protozoa: small animals under the microscope</p>

<p>— Yan Boggong</p>
<p>Children! Today, I will report a small news story to you.</p>
<p>It is said that in the mountainous area of Sian, one day, a hunter saw a spotted tiger in Dasong Ridge. He immediately hid and was not bitten by the tiger.</p>
<p>The next day, he invited many hunters to make a trap on Dasong Ridge and hid a medicine arrow inside. Many notices were posted near the mountain, informing pedestrians and woodcutters to be careful not to step on the trap and fall into it by mistake.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Horses <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>

<p>— Written by Ms. Qin Qianpei</p>
<p>1.  Mr. Black and Rabbit Brother and Cat Sister fell into the sea together, so anxious that they kept calling for help!</p>
<p>2.  The charitable Dog Brother heard it and hurriedly dragged the lifebuoy and ran wildly into the sea.</p>
<p>3.  Ah! The savior is here. All three of them grabbed the lifebuoy, and Dog Brother desperately dragged them to the shore.</p>
<p>This is the Dog Brother's inherent nature of righteousness and courage.</p>
<p>Children: Can you do this too?</p>
<h3 id="e210">Shadowing Game <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Chuo Hengjiu</p>
<p>Children! When you are at home or at school, you must have many good friends, right? I think you must not want to leave your good friends, but what method can make them stay with you forever? There is one! Please see the shadowing game below!</p>
<p>First, we use thumbtacks to nail a piece of black waxed paper to a flat wall (with the black side facing inward). Place a seat near the wall and call your friend to sit on it. Place a lamp on the table next to the seat so that the shadow of your friend's head falls exactly on the paper. Then use a pencil to outline the contour of the shadow, cut it out, and paste it on white paper (with the black side facing outward). Isn't that a photograph of your good friend? Can't he live with you forever?</p>
<p>There are four points to pay attention to in this game: 1) Your friend's shadow must show the side shape, because if it is the front shape, it will be difficult to recognize who it is. 2) When you outline the contour for your friend, please ask your friend not to move, otherwise the drawing will be spoiled. 3) The lamp on the table and the light should allow him to stay still. 4) It is best to do this game at night, because the shadow may not be clear during the day.</p>
<p>One day, a woodcutter frantically called for help in a trap. After being heard by pedestrians, they immediately summoned several people to rescue him, but his leg had been injured by the medicine arrow. Fortunately, the injury was not serious, and the hunters each took out secret medicines to heal him. After bandaging the wound, they asked the woodcutter how he had fallen into the trap by mistake. Wasn't a warning posted near the mountain?</p>
<p>The woodcutter said: "I only saw many red posters, but I didn't know that you had made a trap to trap tigers?"</p>
<p>The hunter asked in surprise: "How? You saw the red posters but didn't know there was a trap? Don't you know how to read?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I am illiterate, so I was injured today!" the woodcutter said with great regret.</p>
<p>Dear friends! After reading the news above, do you feel the pain of illiterate people? There are many people like the woodcutter in China! I hope you study hard at school! Be serious! If you encounter elderly people who have dropped out of school, quickly persuade them to go to a nearby community school to learn to read!</p>
<h3 id="e211">Scary Ants <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Little Franklin</p>
<p>Children! When you read this topic, you may be surprised. What's so scary about ants? But, children, please don't rush, let me tell you about it.</p>
<p>In Africa, there is a kind of ant that is different from the ants we usually see. This kind of ant is three inches long and very strong. Their residence looks like a pagoda, twice as tall as a person, and is made entirely of mud very carefully. Whenever they come out to look for food, there are always thousands or tens of thousands of them, like a disciplined army. If they encounter large animals (such as lions, tigers, etc.) on the way, they will also rush up together, climb on the animal's body and bite it until the animal dies, and then divide it and transport it to the pagoda residence. Therefore, people in Africa are very afraid of these ants!</p>
<p>Dear children, you see, as long as many small ants have the power of unity, they are not afraid of anything. China has such a large population and such a large area, why is it not as good as even small Japan? Children! What is China lacking?</p>

<h3 id="e213">How Snow is Formed <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xiying</p>
<p>Little friends! We all know that when the weather gets cold, it will snow. But do you know how snow is actually formed? I'm afraid very few of you little friends know the answer to this question. Now I will write the answer simply below:</p>
<p>When the weather is cold, the water vapor originally in the atmosphere encounters cold, and the temperature continuously decreases, dropping to below zero degrees Celsius. The water vapor slowly condenses into small, solid, hexagonal crystalline flakes, which fall from the sky to the ground. We call this thing "snow." Its shapes are all different. Although it can be seen with the naked eye, it is very blurry. If we take a microscope to observe it carefully, we can see many different shapes, which are extraordinarily beautiful. This kind of natural beauty can truly amaze us. Its color is colorless and transparent. Looking from all aspects of the crystal, there are reflected light rays, so after it snows, the outside is particularly bright. This is the reason why.</p>
<p>The Heavenly God is about to send down snow, little friends! Let's all observe it!</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (Part 4) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>I didn't know how long I had slept, but when I woke up, the ship was gone. I could see it sailing away, its sails full, far in the distance. I knew that no matter how hard I shouted, the sailors wouldn't be able to hear me. I thought about my sorrowful situation and cried. For a long time, I didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>I was so sorrowful that I was almost going crazy. I thought to myself that if I had put aside the thought of greed for gold and not made this return voyage, I wouldn't have ended up in this situation. Of course, this kind of thinking was too late. I told myself that what I should do was to find a way to get myself out of this sorrowful situation.</p>
<p>Immediately, I saw a tree. In a little while, I was sitting high in the middle of the tree branches. From my hiding place, I could see a beautiful view. On one side, there was nothing to see but the sea and the sky.</p>
<p>When I turned my eyes to look at the land, I saw what I thought was a very large white ball in a place far away from me. Because it was too far away, I couldn't tell what it was. So I climbed down from the tree and ran forward to see what it was.</p>
<p>Before long, I had approached this strange thing and could put my hand on it. It felt very smooth. I walked around it several times, but I couldn't figure out what it was. This big white ball was more than forty and a half yards in circumference and also extremely high.</p>
<p>Although I walked around it several times as I said above, I still couldn't think of a way to get inside. I thought, "Maybe if I climb to the top, I can find a way in." But the thing was so high and so smooth. I couldn't climb up at all.</p>
<p>I was standing there when the sky suddenly became as dark as night. The reason for this was a huge bird. Its wings were so large that they blocked the sunlight.</p>
<p>Then I knew that this bird must be a roc, an Arabian giant bird, because I had heard stories about these giant birds before. What I thought was a big white ball was the egg of this giant bird. It had flown down and was sitting on the egg, incubating it!</p>
<p>Once I understood its plan, I went up and got close to the egg. When I sat down, I was close to one of the bird's legs. This leg must have been as thick as a tree trunk. Immediately, I tied myself to that leg with a piece of cloth I had with me. I hoped that when it flew away the next day, it would take me back with it.</p>
<p>Finally, the night was over. At dawn, the roc flew away with me. We rose higher and higher, and finally the land disappeared.</p>

<p>The Gold Standard Unit Continues to Fall Sharply, Selling Pressure in the Gold Market Intensifies</p>
<p>A Rise and Fall of Two and a Half Yuan in Half a Day</p>
<p>Resulting in a Decline of Three Yuan and One Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday was triggered by the Central Bank's Customs Gold Unit exchange rate, which suddenly fell by 1.3%, stimulating selling pressure and causing a drop. The foreign exchange market was also affected by the money market conditions, which were loose in the near term but tight in the long term. However, because buyers maintained support at lower prices, the situation stabilized after the initial decline. Trading in the market was quiet, with both buyers and sellers mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in an extremely calm market situation in the morning, with only a rise and fall of 2.5 yuan. It was observed that early in the morning, overseas gold and silver markets were flat in both England and the United States, the forward silver price in Montreux slightly contracted, the exchange rate also contracted, and the London spot gold price slightly rose by half a penny. However, the French franc remained weak, and over-the-counter preparatory trading was mediocre, opening at around 62 yuan. Later, when the Central Bank's exchange rate was announced, the British pound rose by 1.25, the US dollar rose by 1.875, and the Customs Gold Unit fell by 1.3%, the standard gold price retreated to 973.4 yuan, stimulating selling pressure, which immediately retreated into the 60-yuan range. After opening, the situation remained relatively stable. However, due to the banks' appetite becoming constricted and the money market tightening, the process of recent foreign exchange drafts became unusually tight and fell. Although buyers came to maintain support, because it was known in advance that HSBC's exchange rate would be 1.25 higher for the British pound and 1.875 higher for the US dollar, retail investor sentiment was downward. In addition, Sassoon &amp; Co. also came to aggressively sell shillings, ultimately making it difficult to maintain support and causing a temporary decline. However, due to buyers' activity at lower prices and the continued difficulty in settling forward exchange drafts, the situation gradually rebounded as short positions were covered. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, still levied at 6%, calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 78125. Subsequently, the demand side became more active, and the price once became firm. Banks took advantage of the high price to sell, which further fueled selling pressure. Short positions slightly increased their bets, and the price became weak again. Thereafter, trading became sporadic. Although short positions were covered, there was still a supply of gold, so the price fluctuated around 8 yuan for a very long time. Later, retail investors pushed up the price, and short positions closed out some of their positions, causing another rise. However, the rise was only temporary, and the supply of gold at high prices was again abundant, causing the price to rise and then fall again. The final state was even more stagnant, with no special changes. The swap spread had risen to more than 10 yuan, and buyers were extremely distressed. The market situation for the morning is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 989.5 yuan, a decrease of 1.4 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hengyu Qianchang Xiangjin's contracts once rose to 9 yuan and 8 jiao, but because Tongfu Fuxing Yong sold contracts, they struggled, hovering around 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Citibank sold February US dollars at 0.0625 and spot US dollars at 0.06875. Hengchang Yong Hengyu Tongtaichang Dadecheng Fuxing Yong and others hastily sold, retreating to 8 yuan and 5 jiao. Dadecheng and Yuan Maoyong bought contracts at low prices. However, because Ruixing Dachang Xiang Hengyu Yuli retail investors all sold, knowing in advance that HSBC's exchange rate would be 1.25 higher for the British pound and 1.875 higher for the US dollar, the price retreated to 8 yuan. Hengyu Tianfeng Tongyu Run Yongli Yongde Shenkang bought contracts at low prices, gradually rising to 9 yuan and 1 jiao. Dachang Xiang Fuyu Shenkang Dingkang Dingtai Zhaofengchang and others hastily sold, retreating to 8 yuan. However, because Xiangfeng Qingfa Yongda Fayong Yuan Yiyuanchang Yong and others limited their purchases, they struggled. Retail investors pressed prices very hard. Hengyu Fuxing Yong Fuyu Jinlong and others sold. Sassoon aggressively sold shillings non-stop, so the price fell to 7 yuan and 3 jiao. Retail investors and Hengyu bought contracts at low prices. At this time, because Dingkang Fuxing Yong and others were still selling, there was still some struggle. Afterwards, Hengyu Zhaofengchang Dadecheng Houchang Yong Dingchang and others all bought, gradually rising. The silver equalization tax announcement remained unchanged. At this time, the price once rose to 9 yuan. The Dalian gang and Yuan Maoyong sold at high prices, retreating to 8 yuan and 1 jiao. Mitsui bought spot US dollars at 0.08125, but forward US dollars were still difficult to buy. Hengyu Changda came to buy, rising to 9 yuan and 2 jiao. HSBC sold March US dollars at 0.0875. Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Qianchang Xiang Ruixing and others sold, gradually falling to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Thereafter, there was not much trading, and the price fluctuated greatly. Although Shenkang and Dadecheng Hengyu sold, with retail investors maintaining support, the market price was held at around 8 yuan. Later, because retail investors raised prices, Richang Qianchang Xiang Dafayong Changdashengda and others jointly bought, making trading even quieter. The price once rebounded to 9 yuan and 1 jiao. Hengyu Tiancheng Xiang Yuxin Xiang and others hastily sold, retreating to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Zhaofengchang and Dadecheng slightly bought at low prices, rising to 8 yuan and 1 jiao. After fluctuating, the closing price at noon was 957.8 yuan. It was observed that the highest price of the day was 959.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 957.3 yuan, a rise and fall of only 2.5 yuan. As a result, the price decreased by 3.1 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was announced with the Central Bank's standard gold price retreating to 973.4 yuan. According to the closing price, it was pressed down by about 15 yuan, a decrease of about 4 yuan compared to the previous closing. The registered price for February was 951 yuan, and for March, it was 958 yuan. The supplemental water in the morning was 941 yuan. The price of red gold was reduced by 2 yuan according to the forward price, to 957 yuan. The spot market was quiet, with no transactions. Tianjin goods were priced 1 yuan higher according to the forward price, but there was also a lack of transactions. The main reason was that after the decline in the standard gold price, the merchant groups lacked the appetite to sell, and the swap spread was even higher. Fuchang paid 9 yuan and 8 jiao to Fu'an for 49 contracts, 10 yuan for 28 contracts to Jiatai, 10 yuan for 21 contracts to Dada, and 10 yuan for 14 contracts to Yuan Maoyong. All were paid by Fu'an. Dafayong paid 10 yuan to Qianchang Xiang for 98 contracts. Dingtai paid 10 yuan and 5 jiao to Yongfeng for 56 contracts. In the current situation of a weak French franc, it is difficult to expect London spot gold to rise. The Central Bank's appetite to buy remained stagnant, significantly affecting the swap spread.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was slow. In summary, Yifeng Yong Qingfa Yong Dingchang Yongde Tianfeng Yicheng Dafayong Yuqing Yong Juchang and others were on the buying side. Zhengchang Hengchang Yong Fuxing Yong Dachang Xiang Fuyu Ruixing Yuli Dingkang Shenkang Dadecheng and others were on the selling side. Hengyu Qianchang Xiang Yuan Yixian entered and exited later. Zhaofengchang and Dadecheng Jinlong exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang and Wanxing traded less than 200 contracts in total, and squeezed in more than 100 contracts. Shunli traded more than 100 contracts in total, and squeezed in a small number. Guangbang Shengda Hengxing did not trade much. The total number of transactions for the day was 16,583 contracts.</p>
<p>For February contracts, the buyers who have not yet swapped include Hengyu Futai Heng Dingkang with more than 700 each, Fuxing Yong with more than 300, Ruikang with more than 200, Qingfa Yong Fuchang Fu'an Juchang with more than 100 each.

The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement was 1.25 higher for the British pound and 1.875 higher for the US dollar, and the Customs Gold Unit decreased by 0.013. The sentiment of Chinese merchants turned fearful. After opening, banks had a selling appetite again, and the process became loose. The HSBC exchange rate announcement was 1.25 higher for the British pound and 1.875 higher for the US dollar. Thereafter, Sassoon came to aggressively sell shillings, and the situation became even looser. However, the far term was tight, so Chinese merchants and the Dalian gang still had a buying appetite. The silver equalization tax announcement did not move. Thereafter, it presented a phenomenon of being loose in the near term and tight in the long term. The overall trend was mediocre. Although banks took advantage of the high price to sell, maintainers were still abundant. There were no special changes thereafter. Extending to the noon closing, the asking price for the near term was: the British pound at 1 shilling, 5 pence and 0.0005625, and the US dollar at 35 yuan and 0.06875.

<p>Yesterday, the one-month futures of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange had stopped and were prepared for delivery on the 29th. Therefore, only one month of the February futures was traded on the market. Observing the situation, there were still many changes. The squeeze and fluctuation had passed, and people's hearts were still weak. Sellers were relatively active, and the market price turned weak and spiritless. The number of transactions was greatly reduced, and entrants appeared timid. The trend was only slightly volatile in the first session, and the rest were flat and weak. Yesterday's process was that retail investors sold very actively at the opening, and large investors also had some entries and exits. The Disbandment opened and suddenly fell by 0.4 yuan, the 20-Customs Duty suddenly fell by more than 0.5 yuan, and the other types also fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. There was a slight supplement in the second session, and the Disbandment suddenly rebounded by 0.35 yuan, and the rest also improved by about 0.1 yuan. However, the 19-Goodwill was not traded at all between the two sessions. In the two sessions in the afternoon, most were weak. Each session fell slightly from 0.05 to 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.

<h3 id="e220">New York Stock Market Stagnant but Firm <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (25th) the New York stock market was extremely sluggish but still firm. This was because the United Corporation's preferred stock and other public utility stocks were quite outstanding and brought the market up. However, the public utility enterprises themselves had no concrete developments. It was only because the buyers believed that the current unstable situation of the industry would soon be eliminated. Brokers paid close attention to this situation. Several people said that if the public utility stocks could truly rebound, it would be quite beneficial to the overall stock market. However, the rest believed that there were still many hidden reefs in the future of public utility enterprises. Although electricity consumption reached the highest record in four years, the profits of the companies were reduced instead. Therefore, they were mostly skeptical about the possibility of a rebound. After the stock market closed, General Motors Company announced that the company's profits last year totaled 85,591,000 yuan, that is, a profit of 1.91 yuan per share. The bond market tended to rise, especially public utility bonds. The stocks on the small exchange had mixed ups and downs, with no significant differences. Chicago wheat showed an upward trend, with 520,000 shares traded throughout the day. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market showed a slight sign of weakness. Because the last market condition for the one-month period was normal, people's hearts felt more softened. In addition, the price of foreign yarn was falling, and domestic yarn was more affected. The upgrading of the two-month period and the near-low and far-high situation made it inevitable that the multi-party swapping was inferior. As a result, the market was slightly relaxed. However, the current yarn southern merchant group's needs were still good.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Slightly Falls  The market opened in the morning, with American cotton falling by one to three pounds and Indian cotton falling even more sharply. The closing price for the one-month period was not firm, and the popularity in the market was even more frustrated. The short side stabilized after the swap, and buyers were lacking. The market was lazy. Each month fell by 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. The market trading in the afternoon was extremely desolate, and the auction time was only 20 minutes. Everything was completed, which shows the scattered and weak market. As a result, the near month was slightly down by 0.1 yuan, and the far month was up by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. It was observed that Tongji sold 1,250 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, Shenji 550 bales, Dafu 350 bales, and Dafu 250 bales. Jinchang bought 1,500 bales, Renfeng 400 bales, Tongfeng 350 bales, Runkang 350 bales, and Tonghe 200 bales. The highest and lowest prices and the closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Mark Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Rise and Fall | Inventory |</p>
<p>| ------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------- |</p>

<h3 id="e222">Flower Market Slightly Reveals Weakness <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly weak. The fall is due to the reaction in Indian cotton, coupled with the return of the one-month forward price at the end of the previous day. People's confidence is waning. Although delivery has not been enthusiastic, financial urgency prevails, and the yarn market is depressed. Furthermore, after the swap, the February contract has been upgraded, dampening the mood of the bulls this month. The demand from existing cotton mills is particularly sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Quietly Listless.  At the opening of the forward flower market, all contract months showed signs of weakness.  The situation in India was soft, falling by four rupees, causing the shorts to feel calm. The reason for its sluggishness is said to be increased arrivals in the interior and bull liquidation. However, the bulls also remained unmoved, resulting in few transactions in the market. For both yarn and flower items, the business hours were only forty minutes. Bull liquidation caused all months to fall by one to one and a half jiao. The afternoon opening remained flat, with even fewer transactions. The opening session lasted only twenty minutes before closing. However, at the time of closing, it was heard that the Indian cotton dark market had risen again by two rupees and seventy-five, so the near months were flat, and the far months rose by five fen to one jiao. It was found that Yuan Da sold 800 dan, Ji Feng 700 dan, Yuan Xingchang 1,700 dan, Heng De 500 dan, Chang Feng 300 dan, and Sheng Yuan 300 dan. Long Yu bought 1,400 dan, Sui Long 400 dan, Yuan De 500 dan, Tai Xing 500 dan, and Ren Feng 500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Forward Flower Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise Fall Account Balance</p>

<p>Mill Demand Continues to Be Absent.  The consumption of raw cotton is exceptionally sluggish. Each mill has absolutely no appetite. In terms of source, 800 bales of Tong flower arrived, while Yao flower has not yet arrived.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the US cotton market, due to the end of the January contract and selling by spot traders, the market was flat and weak, with each month falling by six to eight points. There were not many sellers. Subsequently, due to buying by fellow traders and short covering, it rebounded slightly. Outsiders lacked interest, and traders waited for developments in Washington, so the market was stagnant. Only India showed slight interest in the spot market. According to estimates from the exchange, the Indian cotton harvest is 3.8 million to 3.9 million bales, each bale weighing 500 pounds. (Hesse estimated that factory usage this week was 186,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 292,000 bales.) The closing was stable, with the spot market unchanged and futures falling by one to three points. The British cotton market was flat, with both spot and futures rising by one point. Indian cotton was initially firm due to short covering, but later weakened due to bull liquidation and increased arrivals. Pingguoer fell by 4.75 rupees, and Aomula and Bairuoxi both fell by four rupees. The original telegram recording is on the left (telegram of the 25th):</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the 25th reports on the cotton market for the week: At the beginning of the week, the Supreme Court failed to make a ruling on the gold bar case, causing disappointment among cotton sellers. However, their supply was absorbed by domestic and foreign traders, so the market was firmer afterwards. This was due to frost damage in the Indian cotton region and private estimates of a reduction in the Indian cotton harvest. Ordinary transactions were extremely quiet, and traders were waiting for the enactment of the gold bar case. Legislative discussions are underway regarding changes to or extensions of the cotton mortgage deadline. Generally, people are waiting for an indication from the authorities regarding the next season's cotton production mortgage. It is reported that Mr. Mills, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, will convene a meeting of New York Cotton Exchange brokers in mid-February to change futures contracts and operating rules. The low average temperatures in the South are sufficient to reduce insect damage. However, people in the industry have preconceived notions due to the uncertain situation in Washington. Regarding the beginning of the cotton production situation, they are paying close attention. The attached US cotton weekend statistics are as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the prices of various months showed a trend of first stabilizing and then falling. According to foreign wheat quotes, Chicago rose by 2.0 angle and Canada rose by about 4.0 fen. When prices were quoted, this month, since there was only one day of trading, both internal and external buyers and sellers were liquidating step by step, so the market atmosphere fluctuated and there was not much change. Transactions for far-term months were still smooth, with outsiders buying in and floating shorts covering positions, so the market atmosphere remained stable. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, the market turned weak again. Many holders of the current month were liquidating, and prices gradually loosened. In the far term, it was reported that factories continued to order a ship of foreign wheat at a price of 4 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen, or 7 jiao. However, whether the transaction was concluded has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, the market sentiment has weakened as a result, and with a surge of dumping, prices fell by more than 1 fen. Observing the situation, with the continued conclusion of foreign wheat transactions, the market may show a declining trend during the opening of the Spring Festival. As a result, the current month fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li, February fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, March fell by 1.5 fen, April and May fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li, and June fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat, winter wheat areas are experiencing severe cold weather with thin snow cover, causing some buying. However, the situation in Canada remains the main factor hindering the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed a very strong trend. Foreign quotations have not fallen, and hoarders are particularly firm in their intentions. Therefore, futures prices were called up by 3-5 fen before transactions occurred. The domestic market for spot foreign rice is already weak, but cargo owners are also unwilling to lightly release their holdings with the market. Therefore, the entire market only opened one lot of 500 bales of Saigon rice, and the market situation remained unchanged. Futures opened 1,600 tons of Saigon rice to be loaded for road transport in February and March, and 50 tons of Siamese broken rice for road transport, all handled by this street. The arrival and inventory of Ke Xian rice were both low. Yesterday, 664 bales of Xiang rice were handled by inland areas such as Nanjing, and the price continued to rise by 2-3 fen. Although the inventory of foreign rice is sufficient, they are all unwilling to sell. Arrivals are also continuous. Yesterday, another 18,000 bales of Siamese rice arrived at the port.</p>
<h3 id="e229">River Rice Arrival Turns Active Suddenly Hogshead Price Plunges 2-3 Jiao <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs suddenly turned active again, with a total of more than 60 numbers (more than 10,000 shi of goods). As the final closing period approaches, the sales market is particularly sluggish. Therefore, the appetite of this street is stagnant, and very few goods are being transacted. Although there are also inquiries, they are extremely harsh on the issue of eating the market, and the customer's share is only from the Qingdao gang, slightly handling 7-800 bales. As a result, a trend of frequent declines has emerged. In addition to the sharp decline of 2-3 jiao in the price of various thick japonica rice, other late rice varieties are also difficult to recover, and have seen declines of 1-2 jiao. Fortunately, the limited supply of Du Jian rice has been able to hold its ground, with no great honor or disgrace. Yin Bian Yuan, due to oversupply, has fallen by more than one jiao.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the inner rivers from various ports downstream of the river were still not open, so there were only twelve number one arrivals. Various buyers in the market bought japonica rice. Bian Yuan continued to melt, and Yang Du was stagnant. Early indica rice was active. Market price White japonica rice was slightly tight. Bian Yuan was firm, and Yang Du showed a sluggish trend, similar to early thin rice. The remaining goods were settled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rice merchants' associations in the North and South markets have jointly decided that due to the approach of the end of the old lunar year, all accounts will be closed. Therefore, they have specifically decided to close on the 28th of the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market slightly softened, but in this closing period, it should not affect the overall situation. Statistics show that there were very few transactions. It is estimated that factories handled 600 bales of Guide soybeans at a price of 3 yuan and 8 jiao, a decrease of 5 fen compared to the previous market price. This street purchased 200 bales of Hankou Zha soybeans at a price of 3 yuan and 8 jiao, and 100 bales of Shashi soybeans at a price of 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Domestic inquiries for Dangshan soybeans totaled 200 bales at a price of more than 3 yuan and 8 jiao. The market price has been slightly adjusted by 1-2 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and weak, and trading remained low. The guild's pricing of spot 24 coarse sugar was generally called at 18 yuan and 5 fen, but no transaction was made. Some cargo from this store was slightly sold out at a price of 18 yuan and 1 jiao. Dutch red and Taikoo sugar were not transacted. The original price of cotton white from this factory had a slight transaction. The plate number had the Chao gang opening a price of 10 yuan and 1 jiao to 10 yuan for Huanggang green, and 9 yuan and 8 jiao for the second grade, and 9 yuan and 6 jiao for Longgang green. The rest was not continued.</p>

<p>The current Han market for fungus is gradually rising. The handling price for, for example, Yan fungus has already reached 90 yuan, and Xing'an fungus also requires 88 yuan. The price of Sichuan fungus here has been over 102 yuan. Although sales are not strong at the time of this major closing, the upward trend is still strong. For example, the market price of the Ding Sheng Hao Airlines brand small package fungus is sold to 100 yuan, high-grade fungus is 94-95 yuan, and Yichang fungus is 85-86 yuan, an increase of 3-4 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Eulogy for a Chaste Widow <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>At the end of last year, there was the "Chaste Widow Banquet" in Da Luo Village, Guangdong. At the beginning of this year, there was the expulsion of a "Remarried Woman" in Qingdao City. The Qingdao newspaper reported on the 22nd... Because Wei Wenxiu, the concubine of the late President Li, married the merchant Wang Kuixuan in Qingdao, which tarnished the reputation of the Li family... Expulsion from the country... The feudal atmosphere permeates the north and the south, truly "how magnificent!"</p>
<p>If Qingdao is said to be clean and cannot keep remarried women, Wei Wenxiu, although remarried, is still a clean and upright Chinese citizen. Because a widow's remarriage is already legally recognized in the Republic of China, and in the past, Wei was President Li's concubine. In law, the existence of concubines is no longer explicitly recognized, and this time marrying Mr. Wang is instead legitimate and justified. Qingdao is a small place, harboring many non-Chinese who openly rob and secretly plot against us, yet it cannot keep a weak woman who has been bullied? In a letter to a friend, Wei said: "Now that President Li's bones are not yet cold, and his descendants cannot tolerate me, if I do not seek my own support, how can I survive?"</p>
<p>The world crisis is becoming more urgent day by day. Some countries are working together to build internally and strengthen national defense externally. Some countries are manufacturing poison gas, germ bombs, death rays... preparing for a mass slaughter. In addition to uniting and resisting for a long time, we China are adding the promotion of women's chastity. In the future, we can raise a large number of martyrs and chaste women... One cry will make the enemy retreat, and another cry will bring world peace. We wish feudalism victory! May the goddess of chastity be victorious!</p>
<h3 id="e252">Hair <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yan</p>
<p>Hair on a person's body is inherently the least useful thing, but China has an ancient saying: "Our body, hair, and skin are received from our parents, and we dare not damage them." Therefore, although after the Xinhai Revolution, the whole country was ordered to cut off pigtails (only men, not women), there were indeed many pedantic people who considered dragging a tail to be fulfilling their filial piety. However, the cleanliness and convenience after cutting it off, as well as the world trend, finally overcame the ancient saying. Now, if a man still drags a pigtail and walks around the streets, everyone will laugh at him as a moldy antique.</p>
<p>The most original meaning of cutting hair is temporarily impossible to trace, but it must have been for cleanliness and convenience. Now, among men in various countries around the world, apart from Indians who still like to pile it on top of their heads like cow dung, there are probably very few who keep this troublesome thing. However, women are an exception.</p>
<p>The popularity of women cutting their hair has only been in recent years. During the European War, European women, because they participated in various jobs, felt the trouble and burden of combing hair into buns and braids, and naturally cut it off. It became a global trend for a time, and soon spread to China. At that time, the warlords were arresting revolutionary parties, and at one point, women with short hair were all considered to be revolutionary parties, and a large search was carried out. Fortunately, the revolution was soon successful (?). Women cutting or keeping their hair became a personal freedom!</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang issued an order prohibiting soldiers from marrying women without hair buns. After this order is implemented, women with short hair have indeed lost the qualification to marry soldiers, but as long as she does not let her hair down or perm it, she is still a law-abiding female citizen.</p>
<p>However, it is said that several female leaders in Shanghai have stated that as a result of cutting their hair for several years, in terms of economics, time, and other aspects, there has been no benefit compared to when they had hair buns. From now on, they will no longer cut their hair and will restore hair buns. According to the person in charge of the female student organizations in various schools in Shanghai, the female students have organized the Hair-Growing Alliance (excerpted from the Zhonghua Daily on the 23rd of this month).</p>
<p>Whether this news is true is unknown. As a rule, cutting hair can save gold hairpins and silver hair ornaments, which is economical; it is not necessary to spend every morning tidying up long black hair, which saves time; it is also easier to wash and more hygienic; men cut their hair, women also cut their hair, which is equal. Therefore, since the Northern Expedition in 1927, women everywhere, with the exception of a very small number, have cut their hair. If it is said that perming hair is uneconomical, and letting hair down is unsightly, one can simply not perm or let it down - in fact, it is the idlers who are uneconomical. If she does not perm her hair, she will have other new developments. As for beauty, there is no fixed standard - so, what is the purpose of restoring hair buns and the Hair-Growing Alliance? Is it because there are many Chinese male soldiers, so if they don't do this, "they are afraid they will have difficulty finding a mate"?</p>
<h3 id="e253">Cursing and Love <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Lu</p>
<p>There is a very common way to curse people in China, which is to start by saying "His mother's" something something: "His mother's" is just the most common and easy way to curse people, and naturally there are many similar ways to curse, and according to the different dialects in the north and south, the words used are also different, but we can summarize them into a system: that is, one of the most common ways to curse people in China is to use "sex" as the object.</p>
<p>This habit of using "sex" as the object of cursing is probably not only limited to China. It has also existed in foreign countries. Russian novels can be found in many dialogues (of course, other countries are rare), but this way of cursing is most popular, applied most skillfully, and most universally. When two couples, two brothers, or even two fathers and sons break out in cursing each other, they will generally choose one or several of "His mother's," "Dog X's," "Screw your..." etc., as the most satisfying, thorough, and refreshing and liberating expressions! In short, as long as sex is used as the object and weapon of cursing, mothers, sisters; six relatives, nine clans; ancestors, eight generations, can all be dragged in to insult the other party.</p>
<p>Why is this custom so prevalent in China? Naturally, this consciousness of cursing people with "sexual" relations is the consciousness of despising women; the stronger the feudal forces, the more intense the consciousness of despising women.</p>
<p>Originally, in the feudal system, everything of women was in a subordinate position. In the relationship between men and women, women were also absolutely subordinate and passive. The feudal system blocked all freedom for women, and even in natural physiological sexual life, women were not free. Men could freely look for wives, but if a woman took the initiative to find a man, this would be considered a "great shame" and "a violation of morality." A man could marry several times in his life and approach several women, but a woman had to be faithful to one man to the end, and had to have the virtue of chastity. If a woman had a relationship with more than two men, this was a disgrace, a loss of status, a loss. In short, a woman, apart from that one marriage specified by her parents, should avoid male-female relationships and should adopt an absolutely passive attitude. Otherwise, she is a promiscuous woman.</p>
<p>Feudal society has such a golden rule for male-female relationships, engraved in the classics for women. Then, if a man intends to insult a woman, he can insult her through "sex"; slander and defamation can also be developed from "sex." Therefore, when cursing, if the other party is a woman, she can be directly insulted; if the other party is a man, one can start with his mother, sisters, nine relatives, six relatives! The yin side!</p>
<p>This custom of cursing can be said to come on the one hand from certain social concepts of men and women, and at the same time, this custom can express a certain male perspective in society. Of course, the remnants of a habit cannot be immediately eradicated even after the entire consciousness of that society has changed. However, this habit of cursing is not a remnant in the general habits of China today, but is very prevalent and very "popular."</p>
<p>Now it can be said that the historical concepts of Chinese feudal society towards women, attached to this artistic form of cursing, are built on a very solid "Twenty-Four Bridges," and have been gently carried over from the era of feudal monarchs to the present.</p>
<p>Let's look at the relationship between men and women in Chinese society today, starting from the starting point of "sex," and see what attitude society today holds towards women. Then we will know that this cursing that uses "sex" as the object is by no means an accidental matter. At the same time, from this point, we are very intimately linked to the most realistic and most concerned so-called problems of "marriage" and "love."</p>
<p>People with a slightly more progressive mindset understand that "marriage" should be autonomous and "love" should be free. However, in the process from starting love to reaching marriage, in terms of art and technology, it should generally be initiated by men. It is free for a man to want to talk to a woman about love, and it is also free for a man to propose to a woman; but if a woman takes the initiative to talk to a man about love and expresses her love for him first, this is very unskillful and unartistic. The other party will probably despise her, reject her, and she will encounter failure as a result. Even if this woman is not rejected by the other party, it seems to others that this woman is also not very "decent"! Also: If a man attacks a woman and is rejected, he can still perform for others; but if a woman expresses her love for a man and is spurned, this is truly a "great shame" for the woman!</p>
<p>Based on the above many facts, although today's society is not like feudal times, which used explicit canons to stipulate women under the "Three Obediences" and does not regard women as those who should "follow one man to the end" and be servants of their husbands; but under the slogans of "autonomous marriage" and "free love," what have women gained? The "sexual" relationship is secret and passive for women, and is only an obligation without rights. In the freedom of love, women only have the freedom to be acted upon, not the freedom to act. A woman who has gone through a divorce even causes others to feel the need to consider when dating her, which of course proves the health of feudal consciousness in Chinese society today!</p>
<p>My intention, of course, is not to prepare to do this kind of women's work: to unite and mobilize many young women to attack and surround men, and to open a large love training institute. My intention is: as long as it is not "parents' orders" and "matchmakers' words," marriage is based on mutual willingness, and love is also based on mutual willingness, not one-sided willingness. In the relationship between men and women, there should be no division between initiative and passivity, no stipulations of master and servant, and the subordinate status of women must be abolished.</p>
<p>The custom of cursing "His mother's" and the old male-female relationship that sacrifices women are a fire snake, locked by an iron chain; if you feel that the phrase "His mother's" sounds unpleasant, then naturally you also cannot stand this old male-female relationship. In short, the art of cursing "His mother's" brings some danger to women's love!</p>

<h3 id="e254">"A Social Person's" Self-Description <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— By She Ying</p>
<p>My personal involvement in society began during the 1911 Revolution. The social activities I participated in can be broadly divided into two categories: engaging in journalism and participating in the women's movement. My time teaching in schools was relatively short, only three to five years in total.</p>
<p>Period in Journalism</p>
<p>I recall that during the 1911 Revolution, women enthusiastically participated. At that time, women's organizations sprang up like mushrooms after rain, petitioning for the Northern Expedition and assisting with military expenses. As a young and passionate reporter, I eagerly wanted to see the revolution succeed immediately, so I bravely joined the activities. At that time, the aspirations of most women were entirely focused on striving for the revolution and seeking welfare for the country and the nation, unlike the subsequent women's movement that fought for equality. At the time, my father and Mr. Yu Youren, Mr. Song [blank], and other gentlemen used the Minli Pao as a revolutionary organ for creating an atmosphere and propagating ideas. I was assigned to edit the supplement, which was the beginning of my life as a journalist. Afterwards, I almost entirely pursued a career as a journalist, with the longest period being spent at the Zhonghua Xinbao. Initially, I edited the literary supplement, and later I was in charge of the "Women and Family" section for about seven or eight years.</p>
<p>Overview of Participation in the Women's Movement</p>
<p>Since the 1911 Revolution, the first organization I joined was the Shenzhou Women's Relief Society. I was responsible for editing the Shenzhou Women's Gazette monthly magazine. In the first year of the Republic, five groups merged and reorganized the Nationalist Party, holding their first inaugural meeting at Zhang Garden on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai. I served as a recorder at the time. There were four recorders on that day, two men and two women. One was a reporter from the Minquan Pao, Mr. [blank]. Another was Xu Xue'er, a reporter from the Minli Pao. One was Yang Jiwei from Wujiang. And the last was myself. Twenty years have passed. Mr. [blank] now holds an important position in the party and the nation. Mr. Xu has passed away. Mr. Yang is often ill. As for myself, I remain the same as before. Each of us has a different situation, which shows the changes in human affairs. During the May Fourth Movement, I participated in the patriotic movement in Shanghai. In the autumn of the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], I initiated the Shanghai Women's Rights Movement League with comrades, in response to the Beijing Women's Rights Association. In the spring of the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925], I united with comrades in the women's movement in Shanghai and Hangzhou to organize the Chinese Women's Association, and I also edited a special publication. Because the international status was important, there had to be a liaison organization between countries, so at the beginning of its establishment, it joined the International Women's Association to communicate the voice of the women's movement to the world and to win international sympathy. In the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], when the revolutionary army first arrived in Shanghai, it was organized by the Propaganda Department of the Eastern Front Political Department to create the Shanghai Women's Movement Committee. At the same time, it published the Women's Movement Ten-Day Publication to promote women's awareness of the revolution and the women's movement. In the summer and autumn, in order to concentrate the strength and will of the women's movement, I organized the Shanghai Women's Organizations Unity Association with my colleagues. As for those who merely participated and contributed nothing to society, there were the Women's Association, the Chinese Women's Suffrage Association, and the movement to promote domestic goods by women, as well as certain women's organizations, etc. Since they have no special achievements, they are not worth mentioning. In the spring of the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], in view of the disunity of the women's movement and the need for a propaganda organ to act as its mouthpiece, I co-founded the Women's Resonance Society with my colleagues and published Women's Resonance. Initially, it was a bi-monthly publication, and in the twenty-first year of the Republic [1932], it was changed to a monthly publication. Fortunately, due to the efforts of my colleagues, it has had a six-year history, which is fortunate indeed. The recently joined Nantung Women's Cultural Promotion Association is also for the promotion of the women's cultural movement. In short, my life in the past twenty years has been within the scope of this kind of society and association life. Indeed, journalism and social movements are interconnected. Newspapers have the authority to create public opinion and transform society. For example, the ease with which the 1911 Revolution overthrew the political system and transformed it into a republic was due to the power of public opinion. At that time, the people's thinking was instilled by newspapers, which were full of nationalistic ideas. People yearned for the Han Chinese, so when someone raised an arm and shouted, the wind rose and the clouds surged, and the response was overwhelming! When women first sought liberation, they were oppressed everywhere. Although newspapers claimed to be a sharp weapon for promoting society, they often failed to abandon old habits and truly embrace the concept of equality between men and women. They did not pay much attention to news about the women's movement. Having one more person involved meant occupying one more position. Not only could propaganda be more convenient, but also opinions could be corrected more. At the very least, it could reduce some of the careless tone, ridicule, and advisory tone.</p>
<p>Thoughts on Social Life</p>
<p>In summarizing my experience in social work, I feel that the most interesting and enduring achievement has been the Women's Resonance Society. From the experience of this society, I realize that engaging in social movements cannot solely rely on nominal unity and solidarity to be considered a sound organization or to increase some kind of strength. If a large number of people do not make efforts or cannot resolve their differences and cooperate, they often end up fighting for power and profit or shirking responsibility, leading to inaction and stagnation. Resonance, on the other hand, was initiated by three or four like-minded comrades who were able to treat the society's affairs as their own, treating each other with sincerity. There was no competition for rights or evasion of responsibility, so it has been able to have a six-year history. Otherwise, in terms of women's organizations, there are many organizations with abundant finances and numerous talents. Why do they rise and fall quickly and cannot last long? The importance of sincerity is not great? I would like to say to comrades in social movements that if they can treat each other with sincerity, there is almost nothing that cannot be done in the world. My personal thoughts are roughly like this, and I will conclude my self-description with the above hope.</p>
<h3 id="e255">A Visit to the Childhood Education and Care Institute <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— [blank]</p>
<p>The Childhood Education and Care Institute on Tangshan Road in this city is run by the China Childhood Relief Association and has been established for five years. Recently, I visited the institute to understand its current situation.</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Jinfang, the director, is about thirty-five or thirty-six years old and has a kind and approachable manner. Her answers can be summarized as follows: The institute's organization is divided into four departments: general affairs, education, training, and hygiene. It has one director, six teachers and staff, and three male and female nannies and workers.</p>
<p>The annual expenses are about 10,000 yuan, which is entirely raised by the sponsoring organization.</p>
<p>There are currently more than 90 children in the institute, with boys accounting for slightly more than half. They come from various sources, mostly sent by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Local Court, the Relief Society, and other institutions. Some are adopted or sent back to their hometowns, so there is an average of about fifteen children entering and leaving each month.</p>
<p>In terms of education, the institute has an attached primary school, with a curriculum similar to that of ordinary schools. Due to "economic," "talent," and "location" limitations, it currently uses a combined grade system, divided into six grades and three classes. The teaching method for the middle and upper grades is self-study and guidance, while the lower grades use the design education method. As for extracurricular practice, girls mainly focus on sewing, shoemaking, knitting socks, and housekeeping, while boys mainly focus on developing farms, cleaning, and cooperatives.</p>
<p>According to regulations, children can stay in the institute until they are twelve years old, but if there are children with higher intelligence, the institute can make special arrangements to extend their stay until they are sixteen years old so that they can continue to complete six years of schooling. When underage children reach a certain age, they are either adopted or introduced by the institute to factories and shops as apprentices. When necessary, the institute will find a match for adult female children. The method is not to accept betrothal gifts, but the suitor must prepare 100 yuan to be used for the girl's dowry. The qualifications of the suitor are as follows: (1) unmarried, (2) of good character and conduct, (3) has a proper occupation and has received considerable education, and (4) has two introducers.</p>
<p>The institute has a contact method for children after they leave the institute. Those who want to adopt children from the institute must accept the institute's guidance at any time and cannot refuse when the institute sends someone to visit. The children's daily performance must also be reported to the institute at the end of each semester for evaluation. The training is roughly the same as in ordinary schools. However, the children here cannot leave the institute at will, so there are no opportunities to go out except for mountain teachers accompanying them on visits.</p>
<p>The conversation ended here. At this time, a man in a blue cloth long gown walked in. Introduced by Director Chen, he was Mr. Li, a teacher at the institute. Therefore, I seized the opportunity to ask Mr. Li to accompany me on a tour of the rooms, and this request was immediately agreed to without hesitation.</p>
<p>The classrooms were on the second floor, a total of three. Each classroom was in session. The students were wearing neat blue bamboo cloth uniforms and listening attentively and happily. Because I couldn't bear to disturb their attention, I only stood in each classroom for a moment before walking out. In the classroom of the upper grades, there was a slogan: "Work hard, and we will have a way out." At that time, I was truly touched. Indeed, in this era, what else can a poor boy do besides work hard?</p>
<p>The boys' dormitory was located along the window. The word "cleanliness" was very appropriate. Small iron beds were arranged in rows, with white sheets and blue cotton quilts neatly spread on the beds. The girls' dormitory was on the third floor. Because Mr. Li was not accustomed to using the key, he did not go in, but only stood on a high stool and looked from afar. The scene was similar to the boys' dormitory.</p>
<p>In addition, we also visited the municipal columns and wall newspapers run by the students, as well as the Citizens' Bank! Mentioning the Citizens' Bank, some people may wonder, "Where do the orphans get the money?" In fact, it is not entirely the case. According to Mr. Li's explanation, the institute encourages the work interest of older students. After doing productive work, each person can get wages. These wages are deposited in this small bank, and will be returned to the children when they leave the institute.</p>
<p>The institute's medical equipment is generally sufficient. However, the lighting in the examination room is really too dim.</p>
<p>Walking back to the office, Director Chen was organizing the children's registers. The spirit of this director is worthy of admiration. I couldn't help but feel happy for the orphans for a moment. Although strictly speaking, the establishment of this kind of education and care institute is just a superficial relief work of reformism, orphans are pitiful after all. Since the government is unable to take care of them, then it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to provide a reference for scholars of sociology, I repeatedly asked about the detailed reasons for the children's admission to the institute. Director Chen gave me a recent statistical table. From March of the nineteenth year of the Republic [1930] to September of the twenty-third year of the Republic [1934], the origins of the children admitted during this period were: 153 disaster children, 50 extremely poor children, 9 children sold, 20 abused children, 15 abducted children, 35 lost children, and 20 abandoned children.</p>
<p>Readers, from these numbers, the symptoms of Chinese society are already imaginable. What are your thoughts?</p>
<h3 id="e256">Women and Literature (Continued) <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Zijin</p>
<p>To write about the pitiable nature of parasitic life, to awaken women's self-awareness of their own independent personality. In Ibsen's play "A Doll's House" (Nora), the female protagonist Nora discovers that her husband's usual tenderness, sweetness, and love are all hypocritical, all feigned. Once something happens that damages his reputation, he reveals his true self, scolding his wife for dragging him down. However, after the matter is resolved, he pretends to be magnanimous and forgiving. Thus, Nora completely "understands" and realizes that she has been living with a stranger, bearing him three children. She decides to leave from now on, intending to educate herself and become a "person." Nora says, "In short, I am a person."</p>
<p>In order to demand an independent life and to become a person, Nora resolutely abandons everything from the past: her husband and children, and leaves home. This implies that women's independent personality, being a true "person" of oneself, is more important than anything else.</p>
<p>"After Nora's Declaration of Independence was issued, it did indeed cause a great stir and sparked enormous waves in the minds of the society at the time. Gosse once said: 'This work elucidates the inner nature of humanity. The people who watched the play all vied to imitate the tone of the characters in the play. ... In fact, everyone who saw this play was talking about it and debating it at home, and the family's peace was even disrupted because of it.'"</p>
<p>Since Nora was born, some women have awakened from their dreams, raised their heads from underground, and reached out from the darkness. With their bare hands, they broke out of the haunted tower and went to find their own paths.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>But what happened to Nora after she left home? That is, what happens to women after they awaken? The women after that are the new type of economically independent women trained by Nora's spirit in Shaw's "Mrs. Warren's Profession" (published in 1893), namely, Vivie.</p>
<p>If women want to liberate themselves from the dependent and parasitic life of slaves and demand an independent personality, then they must first have economic independence. Vivie is Nora after she left home, from the family to the society. She represents a new type of woman who uses her own abilities to earn social rewards and live an independent life. Vivie has become a person of the world, a person of society, not a slave or plaything of a family or husband.</p>
<p>Vivie rejects money, status, Duchess Croft, and everything from the old era that Mrs. Warren gave her. She opposes and rejects them. She received higher education at Cambridge University and is proficient in mathematics. She calculates accounts for a female lawyer. After working six hours a day, she takes a walk for exercise. She relies entirely on her own brain and hands to live, without depending on others at all.</p>
<p>Vivie rejects the wealthy Duke Croft, whom Mrs. Warren wants her to flirt with, and mocks the "childish dreams of love" of ordinary frivolous young men. She shouts to her mother, "Everyone has the freedom to choose their profession. The most unfortunate child in the world, although he cannot choose to be the Queen of England or the President of Oxford, can, according to his own preferences, choose to collect rags or sell flowers."</p>
<p>A woman who creates her own life and is self-reliant in this way is the typical new woman after Ibsen. It is also Nora's proper return after leaving home. With a new ideal of life and a firm determination, she struggles with society and opposes old-fashioned people like Mrs. Warren. Kicking aside the barriers built by men with prejudice and selfishness, they enter offices, desks, factories, shops, laboratories, experimental rooms, schools, and government offices, which have always been forbidden to women.</p>
<p>In Hauptmann's novel "The Weavers" (Die Weber), the female protagonist Marie is also a representative of new women. Poverty and distress have strengthened her determination to fight for life. She knocks on the door of a factory and becomes the most hardworking female worker among a large group of workers. The thorns of life have wounded her hands and feet, but she does not feel pain. Fate has thrown all kinds of ridicule, but her iron face does not show a trace of tremor or terror. She boasts of a strength that she possesses: the strength to live alone without relying on others at all.</p>
<p>In Nagrodzka's novel "The Wrath of Dionysus," the female protagonist Tanya is a female artist from a wealthy family. She falls in love with Stark, a young man who is enthusiastic about science. They go through legal procedures to live together. But she and her husband each have their own world, each doing their own work. Sometimes Tanya is caught in a conflict between "love" and "work." But she always uses her enthusiasm for work to extinguish the flames of love. She does her artistic work first. During the passionate love affair, her diary is also filled with words of ardent love for work: "Today I did work. This is fanatical work, and from morning on, I felt that I couldn't put down the work for a moment."</p>
<p>Kollontai's "Red Love" (Red Passion) features Vasilisa, a revolutionary and a model modern woman. She loves her work deeply and passionately, especially the work of organizing public housing. Although she also falls in love, she never forgets her work, even when love is disillusioned or even during passionate love. In her work, she is not at all constrained by love. What is most noteworthy is the calm attitude she takes after losing love. Because there is an endless amount of work piled up in front of her, waiting for her to do it.</p>
<p>Here, it shows that the "love" that was especially valued in the old days is no longer the only content of women's lives, and that "love" is a secondary matter for women as well as men. "Love" is sacred. At this time, it is treated coldly by women and not regarded as their treasure. Instead, "career" is their primary concern!</p>
<p>There are also Phanla, the female protagonist in Potemkin's novel "In the Mist," Maiya, the female protagonist in Helge Krog's novel "The Sound Barrier," Yuxiefu, the female protagonist in Yrjö Hirn's novel "Work," and Dana, the female protagonist in Gorky's novel "The Diary of a Vagabond," who are all typical new women.</p>
<p>After Ibsen, there are already tens of millions of working women earning their own living, and tens of millions of women are immersed in their own careers.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>From the Book of Songs, the Yuefu ballads, "The Romance of the Western Chamber," "Dream of the Red Chamber," the Bible, and the novels of Turgenev, Chekhov, Zola, Maupassant, and Tolstoy, we have seen many enslaved women who are passive, devoted, elegant, gentle, delicate, and pitiable. But after Nora, the rebellious revolutionary rebel of the Ibsen era, there emerged awakened women such as Vivie, Marie, Tanya, and Vasilisa. What will the women of the future be like? There are still few great writers who have come out to inspire, to raise beacons, and to sound alarm bells, but we can easily imagine by speculating on the present. The women of the future will definitely be progressive and developed in both quality and quantity. They will be more advanced than Vivie, Marie, Tanya, and Vasilisa, and the number of new women will increase even more. The new women will not be a group formed by a special minority, but the entire female population. In the future, Vivie, Tanya, Marie, etc., will no longer be new types, but a universal and inevitable phenomenon. Every remote and backward area, every corner of the world, will be filled with awakened and more advanced Vivie, Marie, Tanya, and Vasilisa.</p>
<p>Moreover, they will not have the kind of anarchic, greedy, and multifaceted demands that were present during the era of women's revolution. They will strive to develop their own excellent instincts. Because true human culture requires both men and women to develop their inherent excellent instincts as much as possible. Therefore, I believe that the women of the future, under absolutely equal treatment with men, will not only be doing ordinary general work, but also developing their excellent instincts and doing some special work. This work is needed by society and cannot be done by men, or cannot be done well.</p>

<h3 id="e257">On Guanyin Plays and Their Sound Effects <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabe</p>
<p>Since the birth of the Guanyin Play on the twenty-second Double Tenth Festival of the Republic of China, it has had a history of fifteen months of broadcasting. There are reportedly as many as thirty-nine drama troupes on various broadcasting stations in Shanghai. As the ancients said, "The predecessors plant trees, and the successors enjoy the shade." I am the first person to plant trees, so of course I like to see many pursuers of wireless radio drama art come to my tree to enjoy the shade. But, unfortunately, although the number of shade-enjoyers is increasing day by day, there are still few who are truly interested in pursuing wireless radio drama art. This is already enough to make me feel bad. What is especially unbearable is that I often hear the people sitting in the shade ridiculing and squeezing each other because the shade is not enough, and even the tree planter is being squeezed out of the shade! Don't you think that's pitiful?</p>
<p>"Guanyin Play" is another name for "Wireless Radio Drama" (Radiodrama). Although wireless radio drama is popular in European and American countries, it is still in its infancy. According to many art critics, this little sister's future is limitless. When she grows up, she may be able to do great things that her sisters cannot imagine. Unlike her sister, the drama, which is limited by space and time, she can spread her artistic seeds to the whole world, or even the whole universe, on any radio station and in any season. Only this little sister can achieve the artification of all mankind?</p>
<p>I gave wireless radio drama the nickname "Guanyin Play" simply to make it easier for people to notice and remember. There is no Chinese person who has not heard the words "Guanyin." But what exactly do the words "Guanyin" mean? I'm afraid many great monks can't answer it fluently and straightforwardly. Since I was a child, I have been extraordinarily interested in the words "Guanyin." Several years ago, after I discovered the wireless radio drama of the British Broadcasting Drama Society, I felt that "sound" could be "viewed" only in wireless radio drama.</p>
<p>However, because our plays are called "Guanyin Plays," many Christians and other religious believers still do not dare to listen to them because they fear being accused of apostasy! There is also a joke that wandering monks often see the signboard of our "Shanghai Guanyin Drama Society" and mistakenly believe that we are Buddhists, so they come to us to solicit donations for the repair of dilapidated temples.</p>
<p>Radio drama scripts are more difficult to write than stage plays. Although many speculative books have been published in Europe and America, it is not easy to find many that are practical. The most difficult point is that radio drama cannot use costumes, scenery, lighting, makeup, etc. to reveal part of the environment and personality of the characters in the play. Moreover, because the audience never sees the characters in the play, there cannot be as many characters in each scene as in a stage play. If there are too many, it will be difficult to distinguish them. Moreover, the appearance and disappearance of each actor must be naturally revealed in the dialogue of the characters in the play. The location, season, climate, etc. of the characters in the play that are helpful to the progress of the plot are best revealed in the dialogue in the most artistic way. In addition to dialogue, only sound effects can increase the density of the plot. A pure radio drama script does not need a third-person narrative. Shakespeare's plays are a good model for radio drama because the interrelationships between time, place, and people are all revealed in the dialogue. But it is not the best model because, although Shakespeare's plays have no scenery, they still rely on vision, while radio drama is almost performed for the blind, just as pantomime and silent films are performed for the deaf.</p>
<p>I hear that several vaudeville-ized drama troupes in Shanghai still use the siren to open and close the curtain like in a vaudeville play. This excessively stimulating high-pitched sound is most unsuitable for radio. Since there is no curtain to close, and since it is not limited by space, the characters in the play can walk slowly from the garden into the bedroom in a play with a continuous beginning and end. Why bother blowing the siren twice and adding so many appendix-like reports?</p>
<p>Although our sound effects methods have been painstakingly searched for by several comrades, we have never dared to keep them secret. A machine gun is an iron rod knocking on the edge of a table. A rifle is a rattan whip whipping a wooden board. A cannon and a bomb are the low frequencies of a full-armed piano. The sound of an airplane is a roll of old newspaper lightly touching the two wings of an electric fan. The rest is mostly just a little bit of ventriloquism.</p>
<p>There is also the sound of rain. We tie grains of dry soybeans with short lines to a banana leaf fan. Gently waving it creates various sounds of rain of different sizes. There is a joke about this. Our sound effects technician often stores this treasure in various radio stations. When it comes time to use it, the soybeans have all entered the bellies of the mice. After this, we plan to use beads instead.</p>
<p>Industry Surveys</p>
<h3 id="e258">Second-Hand Clothing Business <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiao</p>
<p>Speaking from the perspective of the overall commerce and social economy, the business of second-hand clothing stores does indeed occupy a very important position. If there were no pawnshops in the market, then the economy of the lower-class citizens in this area would inevitably be greatly affected; however, if there were only pawnshops and no second-hand clothing industry, then many of the pawnshops' overdue pledges would have no outlet. Therefore, the second-hand clothing industry and pawnshops, for the economic prosperity of a market, are mutually causal and complementary, occupying a very important position in the overall commerce. However, the second-hand clothing industry is, after all, a kind of deformed commerce; the clothes sold there are always old, even if some of the clothes are actually not old, the second-hand clothing store itself still has to say they are old. This is, it is precisely using a business method that is the opposite of others.</p>
<p>In the Shilu area of Shanghai, there are no fewer than thirty such second-hand clothing stores. In addition, there are more than a dozen "brokerage houses" also located in this area. People who like to wear cheap clothes, there is no one who does not know Shilu, which is like the headquarters of the second-hand clothing industry, and at the same time, it can be said to be a warehouse for a part of the pawnshops' pledges. Therefore, if pawnshops do not have the second-hand clothing industry, their pledges cannot be promoted; but if second-hand clothing stores do not have pawnshops, they will lack a source of goods. However, in their principle of mutual utilization, it is still the second-hand clothing industry that suffers; because the clothes received by the second-hand clothing stores have to go through a "brokerage house" in the middle.</p>
<p>Their transaction form is that the pawnshops first pack the expired clothes into bags and put them together: regardless of whether there are long gowns or cheongsams inside, and regardless of whether the clothes inside are new or old; big, small, modern, old-fashioned, leather, silk, cloth, all kinds of strange clothes, countless such packages. If the "brokerage houses" want to buy, they can open them at will; but at most, they cannot exceed thirty packages, which is a rule they mutually abide by. After the goods are inspected, the estimated costs of these goods are all added up, and finally, a discount of 30% or 25%, 27% is applied, depending on the case. After the "brokerage houses" buy these many clothes, they classify them one by one; at this time, it all depends on the "appraiser's" eyesight to evaluate a very appropriate price for these many clothes.</p>
<p>Speaking of the job of this kind of "appraiser," it is indeed not an easy job to do; other things cannot be said to be brilliant, but when a package of clothes is sent to him, he can immediately determine which company's products the clothes are, whether they are foreign goods or domestic goods; the newness of the clothes, the value of the price, are all determined by him in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Each "brokerage house" has two such "appraiser" talents, and large-scale ones also use four people; the "brokerage house's" treatment of such employees is always more favorable than that of general employees. From morning to night, if they don't want to come to the brokerage house to eat, they rarely have time to stay in the house; most of their time is spent chatting, either sitting in that silk shop or sitting in that fur shop; while chatting with the people there, they secretly keep an eye on the prices of the goods there, and sometimes they also run to various clothing factories to visit. People who hold this position not only have to have that talent, but also have to be familiar with all aspects of the business community in Shanghai; otherwise, you will only have a "black lacquer gatehouse," and you won't be able to move a step.</p>
<p>The pricing of various clothes by the "brokerage houses" is all executed by the "appraiser"; he divides the various clothes into different sizes, and each hundred taels of silver is discounted by 30% and then resold to the second-hand clothing merchants.</p>
<p>The second-hand clothing stores also hire specialized purchasing staff, and their vision is not inferior to the "appraiser" of the "brokerage house" however, their</p>

<p>I think, if someone were to propose that men marry women, then 200 million women might not completely agree. If it were put to a vote according to the precedent of a majority passing, then it might not be possible to pass this proposal.</p>

<p>The Yang Zhu school advocates "Enjoy the present life, why worry about after death?" and "What glory is there for posthumous fame to withered bones?" These words are most suitable as a portrayal for the young masters and ladies of Shanghai.</p>

<p>In the second issue of the Literary Quarterly, there is a "Chiyoko" with a very strong island country flavor. In the article, Yoshida says; "I have seen through it long ago, even if the whole of China is destroyed, we are still us. Those officers and politicians are still the ones taking concubines with bound feet." This remark is quite enough to be a wake-up call for the people of a militaristic country who are being deceived!</p>

<p>When the Emperor of Shu, Liu Bei, was dying, he said to Kongming: "If my successor is capable of being assisted, then assist him. If he is not, then you may take the throne yourself." These are the words of the Emperor Liu Bei, who saw Kongming's heart and soul. However, in the age of democracy, it is already rare to find someone with such foresight as the Emperor Liu Bei.</p>

<p>Chinese people age before their time and especially like to act old. But the best example of acting old that I have seen is "Niu Jin's Wife" in Lu Xun's "Storm": Niu Jin's Wife was holding a broken banana leaf and knocking on the leg of a stool, and said angrily: "I have lived to seventy-nine years old, I have lived enough, I don't want to see these prodigal appearances!! It's better to die丨······"</p>

<p>targets are different. The clothes they welcome are mostly old-fashioned, long, Chinese-style clothes; Western suits are of course also needed, but they are not very welcome, because this kind of customer is not easy to come by. As for women's cheongsams, they make them even more headache. This kind of clothes is even more difficult to sell than Western suits.</p>
<p>In the current situation of this social and economic downturn, many people who wear Western suits are mostly limited by economic circumstances, so they make do with what they have. Therefore, a relatively decent Western suit does not worry about not having a customer. But women's cheongsams are a bit different; because the tailoring of this kind of clothes is mostly made according to the body's fatness and thinness, just like men's Western suits, but it is even more difficult to change than Western suits. Moreover, general fashionable women simply do not want to wear other people's "old goods"; women in the countryside, they may not have learned to wear cheongsams yet, and even if there are exceptional customers from the countryside who come to buy them, they often fail because of the size of the body being mismatched, and it is rare for one out of ten transactions to be successful. Therefore, when second-hand clothing stores see that they have bought women's cheongsams, they always add the value of this piece of clothing to other clothes; if this women's cheongsam is fortunately sold, it is "extra income", otherwise, they will not lose money.</p>
<p>The transactions between second-hand clothing stores and "brokerage houses" are sometimes that they take the goods and pay the money at the same time. If this second-hand clothing store has a considerable history, or is usually more capable of handling large volumes, then it can take the goods first and settle the accounts again at the end of the month; however, usually, they pay 30% first, and the rest is mostly paid in installments.</p>
<p>These second-hand clothing stores buy the goods and then sell them again, and the profit they get in this transaction is at most 20%; however, sometimes when new goods are sold, it is also easy to make a profit on both the principal and the interest. They generally mark the prices on the clothes with a kind of code that indicates the amount of silver; each tael of silver is equivalent to about six jiao in foreign currency. For example, if a piece of clothing is marked as ten taels, it is actually less than six yuan, but they always sell it for around six yuan.</p>
<p>The worst time for the second-hand clothing business is in the spring and summer seasons; in these two seasons, no matter how much the boss and the employees shout, there will still be no customers. This kind of situation will continue until after September, when the business will gradually prosper; and when the north wind howls in winter, the customers will walk in like bamboo shoots after a rain, and one will be replaced by another. Especially the clothes sold at this time are mostly very profitable; because winter clothes are mostly fur goods, and even the general working class will at least buy a cotton robe. This period can be said to be the golden age of the second-hand clothing industry; the second-hand clothing store's own business increases, and the employees' fortune also comes along at the same time.</p>
<p>In the second-hand clothing industry, employees are mostly hired on a commission basis; it is generally stipulated that they receive three cents per yuan, and some may even receive more than this. But in general, it will not be much; however, in addition to receiving a commission of three cents per yuan, appraisers can also earn an extra cent for each piece of clothing sold. Generally, an appraiser's monthly income averages between twenty and thirty yuan, and at most will not exceed forty yuan; another hope is the year-end bonus. The method of distributing this bonus varies from store to store, with some offering 10% or 20%, but others offering no bonus at all, all depending on the boss's personal will.</p>
<p>The apprentices in second-hand clothing stores not only cannot receive one or two yuan per month from the store for miscellaneous expenses such as haircuts, baths, and laundry, like apprentices in ordinary stores; but the cost of food and lodging during the three-year apprenticeship period must instead be repaid to the boss, which, in the general business situation, cannot be considered a kind of deformed state, right?</p>

<h3 id="e260">The Problem of Japanese Goods Dumping <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Kesheng</p>
<p>Since the global economic panic occurred in 1929, the torrent of recession has been sweeping through the prosperity of the world's imperialist countries with the greatest force. This situation was first manifested in foreign trade. We see:</p>
<p>1931 1933</p>
<p>British exports £454.4 million £416 million imports £860.1 million £678 million</p>
<p>US exports 2.424 billion yuan 1.674 billion yuan imports 2.091 billion yuan 1.448 billion yuan</p>
<p>French exports 30.42 billion francs 18.43 billion francs imports 42.19 billion francs 28.42 billion francs</p>
<p>German exports 9.59 billion marks 4.87 billion marks imports 6.72 billion marks 4.2 billion marks</p>
<p>These are the major countries of the world. From the above table, it can be seen that the figures for their foreign trade in 1933 were greatly reduced compared to those in 1931, which means that their foreign trade is in a state of increasing decline.</p>
<p>However, in the situation of the increasing decline of foreign trade in various countries around the world, Japan has become an exception: In 1933, Japan's total trade volume was 3.74 billion yen, of which exports accounted for 1.83 billion yuan and imports accounted for 1.91 billion yuan. Compared with 1932, exports and imports increased by 33% in total; compared with 1931, exports increased by 60% and imports also increased by 55%. By the first half of 1934, Japan's exports reached 1.03 billion yen and imports reached 1.158 billion yuan. Compared with the same period in 1933, its exports increased by 20% and imports also increased by 14%.</p>
<p>In the torrent of global recession, Japan's foreign trade alone can rise, of course, because Japanese goods enter and exit the world market, that is, because of the dumping of Japanese goods. In fact, all the important markets in the world are filled with the footprints of Japanese goods. In Asia, such as China, India, Dutch India, the Straits Settlements, and Siam; in Europe, such as England, France, and the Netherlands; in Africa, such as Egypt, South Africa, and East Africa; in Oceania, such as Australia; in the Americas, such as the countries of Central and South America, all have become the main markets for the dumping of Japanese goods. Major countries in the world such as England, the United States, France, and Italy have been greatly threatened by the dumping of Japanese goods. During the Anglo-Japanese cotton industry conference in February last year, the British representative publicly said: "The current activities of Japanese goods in the world market threaten the industrial organizations of various countries. If this situation continues like this, then, as a result, Japan may become the common enemy of the world." From this, one can imagine a glimpse.</p>
<p>We know that the Americas have always been the main market for England and the United States. Taking South and Central America alone, the great powers have invested as much as 15 or 16 billion gold yuan here, accounting for 50% of the funds they have invested in the entire colony; but among them, England and the United States have each invested 6 billion gold yuan, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total. From this, one can know how strong the economic power of England and the United States is here. However, in recent years, the dumping of Japanese goods in the Americas, especially in Central and South America, has shown an astonishing degree of development. Please see the table below丨丨</p>
<p>1931 1932 1933</p>
<p>North America Amount (thousands of yuan) 438,865 453,965 499,156 Percentage 38.3 32.2 26.8</p>
<p>Central America Amount (thousands of yuan) 3,301 5,130 16,175 Percentage 0.3 0.4 0.9</p>
<p>South America Amount (thousands of yuan) 10,225 13,133 30,379 Percentage 0.9 0.9 1.6</p>
<p>Total amount including other continents (thousands of yuan) 1,146,981 1,409,991 1,861,045 Percentage 100.0 100.0 100.0</p>
<p>It's no wonder that England wants to say "Japan is a common enemy of the world"!</p>
<p>The dumping of Japanese goods is like "mercury leaking to the ground," and there is no place it cannot enter. The major countries in the world are increasingly threatened by it. The reason why it can be like this, needless to say, is because the value of Japanese goods is low. "Just take the Japanese goods in the European market, for example, light bulbs are two and a half cents each, men's socks are four and a half cents per pair, gold nib fountain pens are seven and a half cents per pen, nine-piece coffee sets are forty-nine cents per set, bicycles are four yuan and fifty-six cents each, and the price of rayon in Marseille is lower than the yarn price in Lyon, and cotton fabrics can reduce the cost by 40% to 70% compared to European factory products." The selling price in other places is also lower than the local market price. Therefore, it can dump its products all over the world.</p>
<p>Why is the selling price of Japanese goods so low? According to the Japanese themselves, it is: 1. The yen is low and the foreign exchange market has fallen; 2. Technological progress and industrial rationalization; 3. Low labor wages and increased production efficiency; 4. Convenient sea transportation; 5. The increasingly close economic relationship between Japan and "Manchukuo" stimulates the development of Japanese industry; ...... (See page 99 of the December issue of the Japanese "Diplomatic Times"). These are indeed important reasons why Japanese goods are so cheap. However, due to space limitations, we cannot discuss these reasons in detail one by one. Now, let's quote a paragraph of Mr. Xu Dixin's explanation of this issue below for reference 丨丨</p>
<p>"Vigorously implementing dumping is premised on currency inflation, wage reduction, and strengthening the exploitation of labor. ...... In the past three years, the yen has depreciated by about 60%, but the selling price has only increased by about 18%, while the cost of living (Tokyo) index has increased from 136 in 1931 to 148 in 1932. As for currency wages, the index in 1931 was 91.3, and it fell to 85.1 in June 1932. Wages have decreased by 6%, while the cost of living has increased by 9%. The real wages of Japanese workers have decreased by 15% in two years. The income of workers has been greatly reduced, but the labor of workers has been deeply squeezed out. According to the statistics of Mitsubishi Bank, the general industrial production index in Japan was 100.7 in 1931, but it increased to 137.6 in October 1933. In three years, it increased by 37%. This 37% production index is the blood and sweat that Japanese workers have spent under the conditions of reducing wages and strengthening labor." (See page 35 of Volume 31, Issue 18 of "Eastern Magazine")</p>
<p>The most important reason for the recent rise of Japanese industry, the low value of Japanese goods, and the ability of Japanese goods to dump their products everywhere and threaten the world market is that Japan exploits its domestic workers to make the cost of its various goods cheap.</p>
<p>The major countries in the world have been threatened by the dumping of Japanese goods, so of course they have to find ways to deal with it. Therefore, England first prompted India to greatly increase the import tax on Japanese cotton, restricting the import of its cotton textiles; at the same time, it also raised its own tariffs to resist the dumping of Japanese goods. The United States has also implemented raising tariffs and restricting the import of Japanese goods since it implemented the Agricultural Relief and Industrial Recovery Act in 1933. Dutch East Indies also conducted a boycott of Japanese goods at the same time as England. ...... In this way, the entry and exit of Japanese goods in the world market is like "a rat crossing the street", and people are shouting "Beat! Beat!" everywhere! If Japanese goods continue to desperately dump their products on the world market, we believe that other countries will continue to find ways to deal with it.</p>
<p>However, England and the United States can use methods such as raising tariffs and restricting imports to resist the dumping of Japanese goods, but only general weak nations, especially semi-colonial countries, cannot use extremely effective methods to deal with it. Therefore, when Japanese goods run into walls everywhere, they desperately attack places with weaker resistance. Our country has always been Japan's most important market, and under the dumping of its goods, of course, it is the first to be looted. In this situation, what countermeasures should we take? This is what we hope people across the country will pay special attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e261">The Card Method of Literary Research <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Yijun</p>
<p>"Card method" is the best method of collecting research data. Anyone who studies can get a lot of convenience from this method. Literary people can also get a lot of help from this method to collect writing materials. Now I want to give a brief introduction to this method and its application in literary research.</p>
<p>First of all, I have to explain the "card" itself. The form of "card" is usually a rectangular thick paper about four inches long and three inches wide, but there are also some that are larger or smaller than this. The paper is not limited to that kind, Daolin paper, twill paper... are all available, as long as it meets the conditions that it is suitable for writing on both sides and is easy to collect and not easy to damage. It is best to have different colors of paper, which is needed for material classification; for example, in terms of literature, valuable materials read from literary books and newspapers may be recorded on yellow paper, writing materials may be recorded on blue paper, and miscellaneous feelings, essays, experiences, questions, etc. may be recorded on light red paper, and so on. This is still a rough classification, and there are also more detailed classifications. For example, in the creation aspect, if you want to collect materials for a novel, you want to record it with one color, and for the materials for another novel, you may use another color of paper to record it. In short, there can be many kinds of paper colors, and the purpose is entirely for easy search, examination, and classification. After doing this work for a long time, a lot of materials of the same kind will accumulate, and you will know a lot about this matter. When you write, you will not feel the pain of lack of materials, and the content of your article will not be empty and without anything.</p>
<p>The recording method is like this: For example, you want to write a novel (or a thesis, essay, miscellaneous feeling... all are OK). Suppose the name of your novel is "Passion". You must first write these two words in the upper left corner of the card. On the next line, you may write down your inspiration, the materials you have obtained, your theme (such as the contradiction and conflict between revolutionary passion and love passion, etc.), your temporary most satisfactory words and sentences, your flow of thoughts... These various materials may not be coherent, even if the words and sentences are not coherent due to haste, it does not matter, because this is not originally for others to see. You should always write down the materials you get today, and even tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, next month, next year, three or five years, seven or eight years later, if your great work is still not written, you still have to continue to write down those necessary materials at any time. It is not uncommon for the number of cards to accumulate to hundreds or even thousands for a book. Naturally, ordinary random feelings, essays, etc., only need one or two or at most three or five.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the best way to preserve memory. In today's society, people and events are complicated, and our little inspiration and little materials are easily lost unnoticed. If we have the habit of recording them with card paper, we can save these things at any time, and we can take them endlessly and use them inexhaustibly in the future.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is much more convenient and easier to take notes with card paper than with a "notebook". The biggest drawback of notebooks is that they are inconvenient to open, inconvenient to classify, and too troublesome to search and examine. However, note card paper can be used at any time, and the above-mentioned shortcomings can be avoided.</p>
<p>The preparation of this card paper is also extremely easy. Because the area is not large, an ordinary piece of Daolin paper can</p>

<h3 id="e262">Impression of Master of Sinology, Mr. Hu Puan <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Sang Ying</p>
<p>Whenever Mr. Hu Puan is mentioned, the four words "Master of Sinology" immediately come to mind. Indeed, among the people of our time, regarding sinology, those with truly profound attainments, Mr. Hu Puan, I fear, is the last glimmer of a dying tradition!</p>
<p>He once served as the Commissioner of Civil Affairs in Jiangsu Province. Navigating the officialdom seemed not to be his forte. During his tenure, it was heard that he very much wanted to develop the aspirations of a scholar, but alas, amidst a world of universal intoxication, he alone was sober. His efforts yielded little result. After resigning, he remained with sleeves empty of riches, living in seclusion in Shanghai. From then on, he no longer set foot in the political vortex, only making a living by running newspapers and teaching at various universities.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Mr. Hu was in the Arts program at ×× College.</p>
<p>Before meeting Mr. Hu, I always imagined him to be a gentle and refined scholar. But when Mr. Hu walked into the classroom that day, carrying a briefcase under his arm, I realized that my conjecture was completely wrong, and even absurd and laughable. Mr. Hu was entirely a "Northern type" of large man, with a robust physique, a purplish-brown complexion, a long, grizzled beard on his mouth, spectacles with wide tortoiseshell frames on his nose, wearing a melon-shaped cap, and dressed in a loose-fitting gray cloth gown.</p>
<p>丨丨 Mr. ×, look how hale and hearty the old gentleman is!</p>
<p>丨丨 Yes, and I've heard that he is punctual for every class he teaches in any school, without the habit of professors these days wasting time.</p>
<p>I remember that the class that day started at seven in the morning. Isn't that the time when those young masters and mistresses are usually still "sleeping soundly in seclusion"?</p>
<p>Walking up to the podium, he sat securely in the teacher's chair, took off his wide-rimmed glasses from the bridge of his nose, and started calling the roll. His two large eyeballs shot towards the faces of the students whose names were called. His voice was loud and resonant, immediately revealing that he was not someone who grew up in the water and soil of the South. Moreover, his pronunciation was mixed with many Hui dialect sounds.</p>
<p>He lectured on "Xunzi's Theories."</p>
<p>丨丨 "Human nature is evil; that which is good is artificial!"</p>
<p>When he said this famous quote from Xunzi, he took off the melon-shaped cap from his head, placed it on the podium, and his spirit became increasingly energetic. He even stood up from the teacher's chair and gave an "impassioned exposition" for fifteen minutes, then sat back down in the teacher's chair and chanted from his self-edited lecture notes.</p>
<p>His lecture notes were elegant in language, sonorous, and easy to recite, truly excellent classical prose. Those few pages of lecture notes are still hidden in my book trunk to this day.</p>
<p>For the entire hour, from the beginning to the end of class, I always remember that the old gentleman's face was constantly tense, without even a hint of a smile. At that time, I thought of the demeanor of an ancient ascetic monk. Once, I don't know what he was lecturing on, the old gentleman exceptionally used male-female love as an analogy, but coming from the mouth of Mr. Hu, who didn't tell jokes, it always felt a little out of place, I felt at the time.</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I last saw Mr. Hu. Unexpectedly, on Saturday afternoon of the previous week, when I was walking at the intersection of Connaught Road and Jiaozhou Road, I met an elderly man of tall stature coming towards me. He was walking with his head held high and with a wide stride. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Mr. Hu. That day, the north wind was biting cold. Mr. Hu was wearing a loose-fitting overcoat, and because the buttons were not fastened, the coat was opened by the force of the wind. It seemed that there was also a young lady accompanying him. She was probably his daughter!</p>
<p>He might not be able to call out my name, but he certainly could still recognize me. After greeting each other, we did not talk much on the roadside and then nodded in farewell.</p>
<p>My relationship with Mr. Hu is very shallow, but his noble spirit, revealed everywhere in his words and deeds, and in his demeanor, left a very deep impression on me.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Puan is from Jing County, Anhui Province, and currently resides at No. 9, Kangle Lane, Connaught Road.</p>

<p>Six or seventy cards can be cut from each sheet, and lined paper can be cut into thirty or forty cards. Each card costs only three or four cents. One dollar can cut eight or nine hundred to a thousand cards, enough for you to use for two or three years. And this kind of paper is also sold in the market, but it is relatively more expensive. This kind of card stock is usually kept by people who study in a multi-layered long wooden cabinet, inside which it is separated by hard paper by category, systematically and meticulously, without any disorder. You can find the material you need inside in less than a minute. Assuming you can't afford a cabinet (which costs at least five or six dollars), you might as well have a drawer or box specifically for these cards, the effect is the same.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I read an article in "The Middle School Student" by Mr. Xie Liuyi recommending this method, "To Literary Youths," which, although somewhat brief, is still quite worth considering. I might as well quote a few sentences below: "······· I advise you to use the 'card system.' Let us buy some thick paper cards and put them in a drawer; write down our daily experiences and thoughts on the cards. Anything sensed by the five senses, imagined by intuition, must be written on a card. No matter how many cards you write each day, put them in the drawer at hand. After accumulating day by day, the accumulated cards should be quite a few. On Saturday evenings, slowly sort out the cards, there is quite a lot of fun.······" Scholars, writers, university students, middle school students can certainly use card stock, and even generally uneducated people who want to study can also use card stock. Although this is not an era of studying behind closed doors, but at least one person should always have some knowledge, some ability to express themselves, so I still recommend this method that I have used to you, my wise readers.</p>

<p>— He Sheng</p>
<p>Correspondence from Qianshan County, Anhui</p>
<p>I remember Zeng Guofan once said that "raising pigs, weaving cloth, and making oil are sideline occupations for farmers." In various parts of Anhui, especially in central, western, and northern Anhui, these three kinds of sideline occupations for farmers are indeed very commonly distributed. There are very few farmers in any place who do not raise pigs or weave cloth; naturally, there are also quite a few places where making oil is a sideline occupation. Just like in our small place 丨丨 Qianshan County, Anhui 丨丨, farm families who make oil as a sideline occupation are "everywhere."</p>
<p>Making oil is a more troublesome and laborious matter than raising pigs or weaving cloth. To make oil, one must first have a work machine 丨丨 "oil mill." In the inland rural areas, it is naturally out of the question to use any "machines"; oil-making equipment is nothing more than some hand-made "oil vats" and "oil baskets," etc. The labor used is nothing more than the blood and sweat painstakingly accumulated by farmers. The composition of an "oil mill" generally consists of the following: a house specially built for the purpose of "making oil," a clumsy "oil vat," the "oil channel" underneath the "oil vat," and "oil baskets" for receiving the oil, etc. A special feature of this house is that there must be a thick wooden beam on its roof ridge, to which must be tied an extremely sturdy hemp rope, with a heavy wooden weight of several hundred or even a thousand pounds suspended from the lower end of the rope. As for the purpose of this thing, I will leave it for later. The structure of the "oil vat" is also quite simple: a large tree that several people can embrace is cut off, the middle is hollowed out, planed smooth, and then steel plates are inlaid around it, and countless small holes must be left in the ones inlaid on the bottom surface so that the oil can leak out. On both sides of the "oil vat," wooden boards or iron plates must be inlaid that are a few points higher than the "oil vat" in order to "add wedges" when pressing the oil. In order to squeeze the "oil cake" in the "oil vat," a heavy wooden board or heavy iron plate on top of the "oil vat" is necessary. Also, this kind of "oil vat" is usually nailed together with iron stakes, so it is very strong.</p>
<p>The process of "making oil" is roughly like this: first, we must have "oil cakes." "Oil cakes" have various differences in quality: there are "sesame cakes," "rapeseed cakes," "cottonseed cakes," etc. From these various "oil cakes," we can extract "sesame oil," "rapeseed oil," "cotton oil," and various other kinds of "oil." The composition of "oil cakes" also requires a bit of work. First, the constituent materials of the "oil cake": sesame seeds, rapeseed, cottonseed, etc., must be dried, and then put into a specially made "mill" 丨丨 this "mill" is usually pulled by oxen, and its capacity is quite large, capable of grinding more than ten dan per day 丨丨 to be ground. After grinding, it must be put into a pot and stir-fried until cooked over a fire. After stir-frying, it must be mixed with a considerable amount of water to make it sticky and wet, and finally it must be "stamped into cakes." "Stamping into cakes" is a procedure in which the stir-fried and sticky raw materials mentioned above are placed in molds of a certain size and form, and stamped into "oil cakes" with the feet. The person who "stamps cakes" is a specially trained "oil worker."</p>
<p>After we have the "oil cakes," we should place them neatly in the "oil vat," arranged so well that there is not a single gap left in the "oil vat." It is also necessary for them to be placed flat. After placing them flat, we use that heavy wooden board (or iron plate) to press on top of them, adding "wedges." The "oil cake" is subjected to pressure, and the "oil" naturally flows out from the small holes at the bottom into the "oil channel." If not much oil comes out, and it is necessary to add more "wedges," then the "wedges" that are pointed at one end and clumsy at the other (i.e., the "inclined plane" in physics) must be driven in. These "wedges" are usually not very small, and the method of driving them in is extremely special. Didn't I say above that a thick and heavy wooden beam must be suspended from the rough and heavy roof beam of the "oil mill" with hemp ropes? This is necessary for driving in the wedges. The method is that there is a person in front who holds the heavy wood like a helmsman on a ship, aiming it at the "wedge" to be driven in. Behind them, there are four or five or six or seven people, each holding one side of the heavy wood, using all their strength to hit the wooden wedge. Like this, hitting it again and again, with increased pressure, the oil in the "vat" flows out again and again. If the oil flows out less again, add more wedges again and hit it again, and so on, until all the oil has been squeezed out.</p>
<p>The "oil channel" that receives the oil is constructed with a special inclination, for the sake of facilitating the "downward flow" of the oil. The end of the "oil channel" is tightly connected to an "oil basket," and the oil drips into the basket in an endless stream. When the basket is full of oil, take it away and replace it with another empty one to receive the oil. The full ones can be taken to the market to sell, or to exchange for some necessary things. Farmers who make oil mostly have dealings with oil, salt, and sundries stores in market towns.</p>
<p>Since "making oil" is a "sideline occupation for farmers," this work is naturally inevitably suspended temporarily during the busy farming season. Usually during the rice transplanting and grass cutting in the third, fourth, and fifth months of the lunar calendar, and during the harvest in the seventh and eighth months, farmers mostly have no time to make oil. From drying the "oil seeds," grinding them, stir-frying them until cooked, "stamping cakes," all the way to "squeezing oil," it takes up quite a lot of the farmers' time from beginning to end. Just from "stamping cakes" to "squeezing oil," it takes them about three days of work. Therefore, the best time for making oil is the several idle months of the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, first, and second months of the lunar calendar. Now it is the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, no wonder that in the rural areas here, the noise in the "oil mills" is resounding in many places.</p>
<p>Speaking of this kind of noise, I'm afraid anyone who hears it will feel impatient. The sound of heavy wood hitting the wedges, the sound of the oil workers "heaving ho," combined together, form a noisy symphony. What is most annoying is that it is not only like this during the day, but also at night. If you live near an "oil mill," you don't want to get a good night's sleep. Originally, making oil requires quite a few people. Naturally, the manpower of one farm family is not enough, and it is necessary to "exchange labor" with other families. "Night labor" is of course even more sought after. Like this, working day and night in shifts, it is not difficult to imagine the hard work of the farmers.</p>
<p>In addition to the farmers themselves and "exchanging labor," hired "long-term workers" and a kind of specially trained "oil workers" are also often involved in this work. The duty of "long-term workers" is to cultivate the land, but making oil is an extra job for them. They make oil for the landlord, but do not get any reward. In terms of annual salary, their total annual income is only more than thirty yuan. These people can be considered the most miserable. The "oil workers" who are experts in "stamping cakes" are mostly hired temporarily. In addition to supplying food, they can still get about two jiao of silver dollars per day.</p>
<p>Some farmers do not have their own oil mills and want to ask people to make oil for them, so there is also a kind of so-called "inviting labor." Inviting the people in the oil mill to make oil for you, you only need to pay one to one and a half yuan of labor costs for each dan of oil seeds. Usually, making oil cannot be less than two dan, seven dou, and five sheng of oil seeds, so you must pay about three or four yuan of labor costs for making oil once.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more strange thing that must be mentioned, that is, the purpose of farmers making oil is not to get "oil," but to get "fertilizer." The "rapeseed cake," "cottonseed cake," and "sesame cake" after the oil has been squeezed out are the main goals of their hard work. This is truly their life that determines their likes and needs. Farmers rely on fertilizer to eat. It is not a big problem if they don't have "oil" to eat. And this point just illustrates the low standard of living of the general farmers.</p>

<p>Biography of a Famous Person</p>
<h3 id="e265">Biography of Einstein (II) <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Cong Mu</p>
<p>The teachers at Münich's school knew that Einstein's mathematical talent was outstanding, so when he left Münich for Milan, they gave him a letter of recommendation for university. Although this had no practical value, it cannot be said that it had no spiritual effect on his future. After half a year of free life, because he was at the age of schooling, he had to go back to school again. However, the language level of Italian schools was very high, and his language skills were very ordinary, making it difficult to get in, so he had no choice but to go to Switzerland. As a result, after some twists and turns, through the introduction of Mr. Earl Alak, the president of the Polytechnic University, he became an upper-level student in science at the Aargau cantonal school in Switzerland, which was in the autumn of 1895.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at Aargau school was very free and open. The education method was different from that of general middle schools, and it was completely in the style of a university. So he was very happy here, as he was in Italy, and made many friends.</p>
<p>Einstein lived in the home of one of his school's liberal arts teachers named Winteler. This teacher had a boy and a girl, who were both very friendly with Einstein and often traveled with him to various parts of Switzerland. Later, the teacher's son married his sister, Maya.</p>
<p>A year later, he easily obtained a certificate and formally became a student of the Polytechnic.</p>
<p>At that time, the professors at the Polytechnic included Weber in physics and Minkowski in mathematics. Weber was the builder of the new mathematics and physics classroom here and was working hard on various experimental studies. Minkowski made very important contributions to Einstein's theory of relativity; at the same time, Professor Kessel's geometry lecture notes also greatly helped the development of the general theory of relativity in the future. However, at this time, Einstein had almost lost interest in mathematics and preferred physics by comparison. In addition to this, he also dabbled in other academic books. At this time, what he loved to read most was Darwin's biology and Mach's philosophical books.</p>
<p>The person closest to him among his classmates was Marcel Grossmann. This person was his collaborator in the development of the general theory of relativity in the future, and his achievements were greatly related to it.</p>
<p>In his second year at the Polytechnic, in 1897, when he was only seventeen years old, Einstein worked hard to study the problems related to light, ether, and the Earth's motion, which were the central problems of the later theory of relativity.</p>
<p>His tuition fees while studying in Switzerland were not paid by his parents, but were given to him by his relatives at one hundred francs per month. In order to obtain Swiss citizenship, he saved twenty francs from it every month, and used the remaining eighty francs to handle all matters. So his life at that time was very poor, and he was malnourished, so that he often suffered from gastrointestinal diseases later.</p>
<p>During his four years of student life in Switzerland, his knowledge was also quite profound. But driven by the idea of truly reaching the core of the natural way, he went on to study philosophy. At that time, he liked to read the works of Kant, Schopenhauer, and Hume, especially inclined towards Hume.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1900, when Einstein was twenty-two years old, he graduated from Kiliqi's Polytechnic (equivalent to China's engineering university or polytechnic university), and passed the national examination with excellent grades. His diploma could be used as an official license for mathematics and physics teachers. From then on, he had to leave the help of his uncles and seek his own livelihood, but when he first went to his professors to seek a career, he did not get any results, which can be said to be his first failure to seek a career.</p>
<p>Originally, to be a formal teacher in a Swiss school, one must have Swiss citizenship, but Einstein had not yet obtained it; moreover, he was Jewish, and even in free Switzerland, Jews were everywhere subject to exclusion and oppression. Therefore, it was very difficult for Einstein to find a job after graduating, and he had to taste the pain of unemployment for a while. It wasn't until the second year, 1901, that he found a temporary position at a vocational school. But this position was only temporary after all, so after a few months he was unemployed again and had to temporarily live by relying on friends. Later, he discovered an advertisement in the newspaper asking to hire a home tutor, and after a series of procedures, he finally managed to save a home tutor position.</p>
<p>Most graduates of university physics departments work as technicians or teachers. But after Einstein graduated, he spent a whole year without finding a more suitable position. This was of course a very anxious problem for him. Later, fortunately, his friend from his student days, Marcel Grossmann, sympathized with his poverty and asked his father to write a sincere letter of introduction for Einstein, introducing him to the Director of the Patent Office in Bern, Halla. From this, Einstein began to serve in the Bern Patent Office in 1902. Before this, he had already obtained Swiss citizenship.</p>
<p>After Einstein entered the Patent Office, his life was considered relatively stable. Here, he wanted to make as much use as possible of his spare time and even working time to engage in his great research. However, the regulations of the bureau were that personal matters were not allowed during office hours, so it was really very difficult for Einstein to do his research work during office hours. Sometimes, just as he was drawing a diagram or calculating something on a small piece of paper, if he heard footsteps outside the door, he would immediately stuff the small piece of paper or the diagram he was drawing into the drawer, otherwise, if the director saw it, he would definitely be severely criticized.

<p>Opening Chapter "Winter"</p>
<p>Heavy snow is falling again this winter. Six-petaled flowers fly, heralding a year of abundance. Dark clouds thickly cover the severe cold. Only when winter arrives does snow come again. Only to see every household closing its doors, the streets silent. Only because the cold air does not melt. Like a blade blowing, the skin wants to crack. A mad roar rises from the fence in the bitter wind. The cold is so unusually strong. The curtains outside the window are layered. Still, they report fighting each other. The whole body shivers, and the back bends like a bow. Lowering the head and exhaling into the hands is a poor sight. Bending the back and calling out to the waist is like bowing. Rich families have everything prepared. The poor have no money and are cold and dazed. The wealthy light a roaring fire. The family gathers warmly. It is a pity that at this time, a poor man runs. Running on the snowy road to earn stinky copper. Helplessly braving the cold air. The whole body trembles from the cold attack. In the snow-covered streets, one must work hard. Running around can avoid hunger. Not like wealthy children. Sitting safely in the hall like a great lord. A hundred responses with one call, there is no need to say. Winter snow has nothing to do with the cold air impact. He is unaware of seeking plum blossoms in the snow. Completely mercenary and petty. On weekdays at home, he only flatters. Most in line with his wishes and secretly happy. The winter air condenses cold, startling guests. No door to ask for help, following a vagrant's trail. It is a pity that this man will freeze to death. Who pities and provides food and clothing. Don't say the young master's intention. There is absolutely no kindness in his heart. Even claiming to be a chivalrous hero. It's just a false name, angling with extreme skill. In reality, he does hidden good deeds. He pretends to be stupid like a deaf-mute. A rich man's feast is the millet of a thousand homes. It is truly a sigh to look up at the sky. The path of the world is rough and impassable.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Who is Hollywood's Highest-Earning Star? (Part 2) Chen Xiong <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>On the list of million-dollar films, music productions account for the most, and since the beginning of film history, the dance-song film "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and "Ben-Hur" have consistently held the record for box office revenue in cinemas around the world. With the advent of sound film, "What Price Glory" (also known as "Magnificent Flirt") broke all records, and this film also belongs to the music production category.</p>
<p>Novel productions have a significant impact on box office revenue. Among Janet Gaynor's seven million-dollar productions, "Seventh Heaven" had the highest record with three million. Although this film cannot be considered Janet Gaynor's best work, because she sang for the first time in this film, she used the novelty psychology to attract many viewers.</p>
<p>Although Greta Garbo is a very popular star in Hollywood, her value is several times higher than other stars, but only two of her films have earned over one million U.S. dollars. One is "Anna Christie," her first talkie, because advertisements heavily promoted the novelty of "Garbo talks!" to lure Garbo fans. As expected, "Anna Christie" was three times more profitable, even Garbo could not have imagined it. As for the second million-dollar production, "Grand Hotel," this cannot be considered her personal victory, because the actors in "Grand Hotel," such as the Barrymore brothers, Wallace Beery, Joan Crawford, etc., are all MGM mainstays, and they can at least attract a portion of the revenue.</p>
<p>In the entire list of million-dollar films, we can find a very obvious principle: that in many profitable productions, films with light and cheerful themes account for a large proportion. The endings of these films are usually "lovers become husband and wife" or similar. Although there are a few blockbusters, such as "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "The Birth of a Nation," that end with death.</p>
<p>There was a period when American films were very popular with productions based on gangster bosses. Although they could cause a sensation during public screenings, none of them earned over a million dollars. Therefore, viewers have good judgment when choosing films. Productions that guide society, influence people's hearts, and integrate education with entertainment are welcomed by viewers. Conversely, plots that are shallow and films that copy previous successful productions are rejected by viewers.</p>
<p>Now, we will list some of the important million-dollar films published in the American film industry annual that have been screened in this country:</p>
<p>"What Price Glory" earned five million U.S. dollars, starring Al Jolson, the highest-grossing talkie production.</p>
<p>"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" earned four and a half million, starring the late heartthrob Rudolph Valentino.</p>
<p>"Ben-Hur" earned four million. This film is still popular and being screened, and future revenue will be more than this.</p>
<p>"State Fair," "Sunny Side Up," "Street Angel," "The Winning of Barbara Worth," "The Jazz Singer" 丨丨 Three and a half million.</p>
<p>"Seventh Heaven," "The Man Who Came Back," "Tess of the Storm Country," "Angel," "Delicious," "The Gay Retreat," and "The Man Who Came Back" 丨丨 are all Janet Gaynor's productions. Six of them have been screened in China. The seventh, "The Man Who Came Back," has not been to China because its content involves the face of the Chinese people. The above seven have all earned over one million U.S. dollars, the most being three million three hundred thousand, and the least being one million three hundred thousand. "The Big Parade" 丨 Two million seven hundred thousand. "The Gold Rush," "The Kid," "The Ten Commandments" 丨丨 Two million five hundred thousand.</p>
<p>"42nd Street," "Grand Hotel," "Gold Diggers of Broadway," "Red Dust," "Little Women" 丨丨 Two million two hundred and fifty thousand</p>
<p>"Cimarron," "Resurrection," "Liliom," "Skippy," "The Cock-Eyed World" 丨丨 Two million. "Springtime in the Rockies," "Bad Girl," "All Quiet on the Western Front," "The King of Kings," "City Lights," "Four Sons," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" 丨丨 One million five hundred thousand or more. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e273">New Developments in the Hollywood Film Industry in the Past Year <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The wheel of time is advancing rapidly, sending away 1934 and welcoming 1935. In the past year, if we review the Hollywood film industry, then besides the fact that American films have special capital colors and occupy special markets in overseas countries, still maintaining the past situation, we can find several new developments:</p>
<p>A Major Shackles First, Hollywood film companies have not had the freedom to make films in the past year as they did before. The so-called cleaning movement has given the American film industry a major shackle. The content of the films, so-called sensuality, and immorality, are all prohibited. In addition, the review board's review regulations are particularly strict, and religious organizations oppose it. When making a film, one must take care not to be sanctioned by one aspect, and also take care not to be opposed by another. It is really a so-called careful and considerate approach in every way, otherwise one will encounter accidents!</p>
<p>The Popularity of Literary Films Under this environment, film companies have taken a new approach of adopting literary works in terms of film production and themes in order to avoid censorship and sanctions. Putting already famous literary works on the screen will naturally not violate the cleaning movement, and will not violate religion. Moreover, because the story has already been read by the general public, and those authors are all admired literary figures, the box office will definitely be very good when the film is released. As evidenced by the fact that in the most recent year, a series of literary films such as "Little Women," "A Bill of Divorcement," "The Count of Monte Cristo," "Treasure Island," etc., had excellent box office when they were released in Shanghai. In addition, historical films are also very popular. Historical themes and literary works are of course equally unrestricted themes. This is a new way out that Hollywood film companies have recently discovered.</p>
<p>Child Stars Having Great Luck Speaking of actors, in 1934, there was a new trend in Hollywood, that is, the stars who were most popular in the film industry were not the generally established movie stars, but several child stars who were just starting out. In the past year, established male and female stars, with the exception of a few, have not made any new achievements or new progress. Strictly speaking, some have even regressed. However, among child stars, such as Shirley Temple's fame in Hollywood, she is already a famous child star. In addition, there are many more child stars who have already appeared on the screen and have the hope of success. Therefore, in Hollywood in 1934, we can call it the year of the full bloom of child stars. Such activity of child stars on the screen may have created a new record in the history of Hollywood films. Parents who are currently experiencing unemployment panic are registering their children with film companies, hoping that their children will become famous child stars and be able to have a wealthy income like Shirley Temple's parents by relying on their daughter's fame!</p>
<h3 id="e274">Film Fans Pay Attention to "Orchid in the Empty Valley" <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>"Orchid in the Empty Valley" was originally a famous silent film of the Star Film Company in those years. The actors at that time included Zhang Zhiyun, Yang Naimei, Zhu Fei, and Zheng Xiaoqiu. Because the plot was tortuous, sad, and moving, it was warmly welcomed by thousands of viewers. When the film was released in various ports last summer, the box office was still strong, from which we can know the immortal value of the film.</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of people in society, this time, the Star Film Company has changed it into a sound film, still directed by Zhang Shichuan, and starring Hu Die, Gao Zhanfei, Xuan Jinglin, Yan Yuexian, etc. Moreover, this time, many emotions are expressed through dialogue. Of course, sound films are more spectacular than silent films.</p>
<p>It is said that the Star Film Company has recently received an average of at least one hundred letters a day from people from all over asking about the film's news, from which one can predict the grand occasion when the film is released.</p>
<h3 id="e275">About the Soviet Union International Film Festival <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department Telegraphed the Star Film Company</p>
<p>Inviting Representatives to Beijing to Discuss</p>
<p>The Soviet Union will hold an international film exhibition in February of this year. Ge Gongzhen telegraphed Mr. Zhou Jianyun, manager of the Star Film Company, requesting that the company send representatives and invite representatives from the Lianhua Company, along with Ms. Hu Die, to attend and participate, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that the Central Propaganda Department yesterday telegraphed the Star Film Company again, saying: "According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' notification that the Soviet Union is preparing to hold a world film exhibition, it is proposed to solicit films from your company and invite famous actors to participate. This matter concerns international dignity. How to respond to the solicitation, it is hoped that you will send personnel to Beijing to discuss the matter in person. Respectfully, the Central Propaganda Department."</p>
<h3 id="e276">"Femme Fatale" Will Be Released Soon <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>After a very long production time and publicity time, and at a huge cost, "Femme Fatale" is a Lianhua blockbuster that the Chinese people are extremely eager to see.</p>
<p>If we say that this film is the most brilliant work among domestic films in recent years, then that is not an exaggeration, because many people have already said this during the first trial screening at the beginning of its completion.</p>
<p>Of course, we can guarantee that this is a masterpiece with amazing progress by Yang Xiaozhong after "Good Night." However, everyone should also know that this film has been able to achieve such success not by accident or luck, but by the hard work, efforts, and a solid spirit of cooperation of the workers.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, wait and see, this film will be released soon. The entire film, no matter in any aspect, can show its strong posture everywhere. Especially the performances of Chen Yanyan, Zhang Yi, and Liang Saizhen, it should be said that they are so good that nothing can be added.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Tianyi Silver Flowers <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>···Wang Bin has officially joined Tianyi as a screenwriter. His first work is "Three Women in a Storm" (tentative title), which has now been submitted and is being studied by the production meeting.</p>
<p>···General Manager Shao Zuiweng has completed the affairs of the Hong Kong factory and will return to Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>···"Model Youth" has been completely filmed. Last night, there was an informal screening at the Golden Theater, and the results were excellent.</p>
<p>···"Grace of a Beauty," "Two Brothers," and other films will be released successively with "Model Youth."</p>
<p>···It is rumored that the play "Three Women in a Storm" may be filmed as a sound film.</p>
<p>···"Beiyang Pictorial," "Xin Yun Pictorial," "World Pictorial," "Singapore Pictorial," "Modern Weekly," and other pictorial magazines have always paid attention to film news and photos. Tianyi's photos and news are increasingly striving to be published.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e278">The Legend of the Red Sheep Hero (6) <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Chu</p>
<p>Hong Xiuquan hurriedly stepped forward, grasped Shi Dakai's hand, turned his face back, and said to Yang and Zeng, "Mr. Shi is both talented in literature and martial arts, and is indeed one of us," he said. Yang and Zeng hurriedly stepped forward to greet him and invited him to sit down. They all sat down by the table. Hong said, "Mr. Shi's esteemed arrival here must be for some insightful advice!" Shi Dakai then said, "I have heard of your actions here and have come specifically to join your ranks, to serve as a humble soldier." Hong joyfully clasped his hands and said, "Mr. Shi's talent and strategy surpasses ours tenfold. This is truly Heaven helping us to overthrow the Qing Dynasty." Shi Dakai then modestly said, "Now that the society members are already so developed, how much preparation is there for military supplies and provisions? According to Mr. Zeng's wealth, it is certainly sufficient to maintain things at present, but if we raise an uprising in the future and there is no support, I fear we will find it difficult. My coming here is firstly to donate my own small estate to the society, and secondly to introduce someone who is capable of being a treasury, to strengthen the society's momentum." Hong, Yang, and Zeng all listened and hurriedly said, "This is truly Mr. Shi's generosity and righteousness, but we do not know who you are referring to?" Shi deliberately smiled and said, "This person is right before our eyes, it is Wei Changhui of Guiping County." Zeng listened and suddenly stood up, excitedly saying, "If Mr. Shi hadn't mentioned it, I would have forgotten. This person is truly an extraordinary figure, with millions in wealth, he is the richest household in this county. But how can we persuade him to join us here?" Shi listened and immediately stood up, saying, "I have some dealings with him. I am willing to persuade him to join us." At that time, Hong, Yang, and Zeng were all very happy and thanked Shi. Suddenly, Xiao Chaogui ran in from outside and said, "Mr. Feng has returned, and Mr. Hong's family members have also been brought along." As he spoke, everyone stood up and went outside to welcome them. Feng Yunshan came in from outside, leading Lai Shi, Hong Xuanjiao, and Feng's wife, all walking in from the courtyard, along with several strong men carrying boxes, luggage, and clothes. Hong spoke some words of consolation to Feng, and Hong Xuanjiao and Lai Shi also came to say words of long absence to Hong. Then they were invited to go into the inner room together.</p>
<p>In the square, Xiao Chaogui was teaching several people how to wield a single broadsword. Xiao himself also performed a set of moves, which were very impressive. The onlookers all clapped their hands and cheered. Xuanjiao, along with a female servant, stood under a tree watching, and couldn't help but shout a cheer. Xiao, in the midst of his enthusiastic sword dance, heard Xuanjiao's cheering and hurriedly stopped his sword, turned around and saw Xuanjiao, and quickly bowed. He walked to her side and said, "I heard that Miss Hong has good martial arts skills. Today, I am bold enough to ask for your guidance." Xuanjiao listened and said with a shy look, "I have learned a few moves, but they are not presentable, I dare not show off." Xiao still pleaded earnestly, and Xuanjiao couldn't refuse, so she took the sword, said "Excuse me," and walked over, performing with the sword, which was very exquisite. The onlookers, warriors, watched and cheered, and Xiao Chaogui was even more mesmerized. When the dance stopped, she ran shyly to Xiao's front, and Xiao praised her vigorously, saying, "Miss Hong's martial arts are truly brilliant! I admire, I admire." Miss Hong shook her head without saying a word, returned the sword to Xiao, and ran away. Hong Xiuquan was talking to Zeng Yuheng when Hong Xuanjiao ran over and said to Xiuquan, "Brother! I want to train a team of female soldiers, which may be useful in the future." Hong and Zeng immediately replied, "This is a very good idea, we can gather them together." Xuanjiao expressed a very happy look and said, "It's even harder to bear being unoccupied with nothing to do."</p>
<p>From then on, Xiao Chaogui became listless and changed his usual state. One day, he used the tip of a sword to draw a crooked, uneven Hong character on the ground, and also wrote a small word, lost in thought. Suddenly, someone secretly came up and patted him on the shoulder, saying, "Brother Xiao! What are you thinking about?" Xiao was startled, looked up, and hurriedly erased the handwriting on the ground, then stood up. It was Qin Rigang standing there laughing. Xiao smiled and replied, "I wasn't thinking about anything, I was thinking about how I could practice my martial arts better." Qin didn't believe his words, but laughed loudly, and Xiao also laughed. However, this was also a matter of marriage. Later, Qin Rigang and Feng Yunshan actually spoke to Hong Xiuquan, and Xuanjiao was betrothed to Xiao Chaogui. (To be continued)</p>
