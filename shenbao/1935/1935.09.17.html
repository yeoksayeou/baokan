<p>劍拔弩張之東菲危局。經最近數日問日內瓦與羅馬兩方面之外交戰。各國陣綫益見整齊。現正靜待國聯五國委員會提出具體建議。以定此後之行動。五國委員會之建議。聞今日卽可向關係方面提出。其內容能否為意國所接受。尚屬疑問。國聯方面則視此為和解之終極。如仍不獲解决。勢將援引盟約第十五條行事。此種步驟。與四年前國聯處理中日問題。初無二致也。</p>
<p>東菲問題。自意阿之爭。一變而　英意之爭其爭。點亦自殖民地問題。一變而為國聯盟約及國際條約之莊嚴問題。以及整個集體保安制之存亡問題。此一轉變。益增東菲問題對於國際關係前途之嚴重性。實英外交政策所推動也吾人就數日來英意兩國外交策略以觀。意國顯已呈節節退却之象。如墨索里尼最初主張　阿比西尼亞直接解决。不允第三者干涉。今則何如乎。巴黎三國會議雖僅如曇花一現。仲裁委員會則已發表其裁决書。最　羅馬希望再開斯特莢柴會議。而未獲實現。國聯理事會指派五國委員會。意代表初雖反對。終亦不得不贊成其設立矣。</p>
<p>意國欲使阿比西尼亞問題地方化。已吿失敗。返觀英國。英外相霍爾登高一呼。比瑞典荷蘭南愛蘇俄小恊約及葡萄牙等十七國紛紛響應。一致表示　　盟約之决心。即隔岸之美國。亦根據凱洛非戰公約為桴鼓之應矣。</p>
<p>各國呼籲和平固已一致。然卽謂各國已能一致為進一步之制裁。則尚屬太早。法外長賴伐爾向國聯大會之演說。無隻字提及制裁。美總統羅斯福於贊助赫爾外長之弭戰宣言後。卽亟亟聲明美國之中立政第。卽英外相霍爾亦云「如欲負起盟約之責任。則應共負之。多數國家之安寗。不能僅恃少數强國之努力所能濟事。」可知英國是否卽願獨力肩荷制裁之重任。亦一疑問也。</p>
<p>今再就英法意三國最近數日間之表。小作一槪括的檢討。英法均為民治國家。兩國之外交方針。亦均以國聯為基礎。兩國外交當局。今於國聯遭遇嚴重試騐之關頭。作恪守盟約義務之共嗚。冀予國聯以新生命。收挽回戰爭浩刦之實效。原在吾人意料之中。惟於樹立集體保安制一點。英怯意見本有輕重緩急之參差。今英外相霍爾竟對此作露骨之表示。法外相賴伐爾稱是日為「國聯史上劃時代之日期。」其影響之重大可知矣。此外。英外相復作重行分配世界物產之建議。於英日將來之談　。亦不無相當關係。至於怯外長演說全文。可謂為八面玲瓏之絕妙辭令。其作用仍在暫以居間自任。墨索里尼週旋於此一緊一懈之外交壓力之下。處境甚屬孤立。英法許與之權利。雖漸見擴大。（如巴黎一國會議。時英僅允意得享有阿比西尼亞之經濟特權。今則有併政治樣而予之之說。）而日前意內閣宣言仍云。「意國已出大力受大犧牲。阿比西尼亞問題妥恊解决勢所不許。」並表示準備退出國聯之强硬態度。說者謂其志不過在壓迫國聯中國委員之草　建議工作。然意國今正處於騎虎難下之勢。終不免於軍事冒險。亦未可知也。五國特委會星期秒從事草擬意阿爭議之報吿書、今幾蕆事、今夜或明晨當可完成、報吿書分兩部分、一論意國申責阿國不配為國聯會員之備忘錄、或將兼及阿國之覆文、一根據巴黎三國會議之建議、製成詳細條陳、大旨與巴黎建議相同、而擴大其中若干點、以共同經濟助力給予阿國問題亦列於內、如報吿書互爭之兩造無一接受、則國聯行政院須開會决定應否依據國聯盟約第十五條採納之、如經採納、則將援用國聯盟約第十二條、兩造無論如何、非俟公斷員裁决或行政院報吿後三個月屆滿以前、不得從事戰爭、如在此期內報吿書經阿國接受、而意國遽向阿國開戰、則其行為實背國聯盟約第十五條下之義務、而當受國聯之制裁、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據巴黎廻聲報探悉、國聯會行政院五國委員會所擬解决意阿爭端草案、係予意國以實質上之利益、其內容分為六項、（一）國聯會承認意大利有拓展殖民地之需要、（二）阿比西尼亞國皇日前允許割讓意國之沃加丹省土地、卽作為意國所有、（三）若干土地、其居民不承認受阿個政府管轄者、准許意國「用和平方式侵入一、（四）阿國皇帝對於前所征略之土地、其土著居民遭阿國逐出者、阿國應放棄其管轄權、（五）膏腴地帶、適合意國僑民居住及懇殖之用者、當准許租讓意國、（六）意阿兩國訂立新和平及友好條約、再由英怯意三國訂立恊定、加以補充、此項恊定當由阿國皇帝認可、並將英怯意三國在東菲洲所管轄之地帶、劃定明確疆界云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各國秘密談判　對意國制裁說　一致主張經濟性質　英意軍事調動情形</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據消息靈通方面探悉、對於意國實施制載一事、現正由决定擁護國聯會之各國代表團、秘密進行談判、聞各國代表團一致主張採取純屬經濟性質之制裁、並擬於必要時、解除對阿比西尼亞輸出軍火之禁令、同時對意國則實行禁運軍火、但每次考慮出入江海船隻禁止裝運軍用品之一事、則不免發生若干困難、則以在江海內擁護國聯會國家之軍艦、亦將因此不能獲得軍用品故也、又聞央國認為對意禁止通商、卽足加意國以財政壓迫、其效力可使戰事不至蔓延他處、惟其他若十國家、則以為禁止對意通商、殊與各該國家之利益有損、故主張專事禁化軍火輸出、同時並禁止以煤及鋼鐵售與意國、如是已足、此在英國則以為如禁止購買意貨、反易收效、倘禁運軍火及煤鐵、則非實行對意封鎖、恐未必能收實效、但在意國海岸實施封鎖較諸封鎖紅海、更易引起認眞之事端、此層則亦為英國所承認云、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據每日電聞報載稱、地中海英屬瑪爾泰島當局、昨日頒佈命令三道、（一）凡散佈謠言、足以擾亂人心者、處一個月以下之監禁、並二十鎊以下之罰金、（二）當地報紙倘發表言論、足以擾亂公共秩序者、總督得不加警吿、下令命其停刊、并對報館負責人、處以六個月以下之監禁、一百鎊以下之罰金、（三）各地報紙刋物、如認為不宜在境內散佈者、總督得下令禁止其輸入、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>米蘭　據此間報載、英國駐在亞力山特利亞港之海軍、計有鐵甲巡洋艦二艘、尋常巡洋艦三艘、魚雷艦十七艘、修理艦一艘醫院船一艘、航空母艦二艘、又謂英國海軍司令福勃司已與埃及首相奈辛帕夏成立諒解採取未雨綢繆之辦法、以防戰爭之爆發、該報又謂、埃及政府已訓令僑居阿國之人民速行退出、並謂英國一之空軍數隊、不日卽將抵達埃及之蘇丹港與蘇倫港云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據巴黎迴聲報駐倫敦訪員探悉、英國海軍部對於時局極為關切、就英國海軍集中地中海日益增加之一事、可以見之、英國海軍集中最主要之目的、顯係保護埃及、現已有軍艦八十餘艘停泊埃及亞歷山大里亞海灣、其中並有醫院船數艘、此外阿布克、賽特港及蘇彝士運河一帶、天空飛機巡邏、晝夜不絕、並有巡洋艦若干艘加以保護、蘇丹港則有軍艦十餘艘集中其地、又有驅逐飛機三十架、已飛抵蘇丹、將在該地担任天空防衛、埃及空軍領袖現在倫敦、與陸軍部磋商、並談判購買新機、以供空防之用、此係就埃及及蘇丹而言、此外、英國海軍部之另一目的、乃係保護由英國代管之巴勒斯丁、現有軍艦數艘、已停泊海怯港、海法港者、摩蘇爾油管之發端、而為軍事上之一重要地點也、至地中海之英屬居伯羅島、則將作為保護海軍後備艦隊之用、預料將有英國軍艦多艘、集中該地、如萬一發生戰事、蘇彝士運河及直布羅陀海峽、一旦封鎖、則英國不能再以地中海作為貿易運輸之要道、對於英國、困難甚多、此層亦為英國海軍部之所承認、至目前為止、英國當局所考慮之唯一方法、卽對於印度及遠東之通商、改經大西洋繞道開浦角而至印度洋是也（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>開羅　埃及陸軍部長、頃决定會同陸軍總監、於日內前赴東部巡視防務、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>熱諾亞　本日有汽船四艘、裝載兵士七千餘名、自此間開往東菲洲、人民照例前往送別、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>波賽　意潛艇兩艘今晨駛入蘇彝士運河、開往東菲、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）意國政府近在菲洲意屬里比亞增加防軍、此間泰晤士報每日電聞報頃均加以評論、據泰晤士報駐埃及京城訪員指稱、埃及人民雖一致對阿比西尼亞表示同情、但該處各報、尤其是國民黨報紙、主張一旦對意行使制裁時、如欲埃及參預制裁、則必須以埃及獲得完全獨立為交換條件、至於意國人民之僑居埃及者、其數約達五萬人左右、彼等均深以行使制裁後之地位為慮、故已將具產業着手變賣云、又據每日電聞報駐埃及呆城訪員估計、意國軍隊之配置於埃及與意屬里比亞邊界者、其總數當達八萬員名、同時意軍業在里比亞沿岸一百五十英里、裝置蒺藜鐵絲網三道、以資防守云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>雅典　意大利公使館頃向政府提出要求、請准許該國現寄碇於希臘港口之艦隊、購買糧食、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）星期杪日內瓦與羅馬兩地事態之發展、令人益信星期三國聯行政院開會、聆取五國委員會報吿之後、國聯將達存亡關頭、意相墨索里尼迄今猶拒絕一切妥協辦法、故該委員會雖努力設怯、起草和平建議其實對於前途毫無把握、若干方面預測、該委員會或將提出建議十二項、向意阿兩國徵求意見、究竟可以接受幾許、讓步幾許、俾得避免戰爭、國聯行政院重開之後、將核准此項報告、卽向意國提出、大槪意國將加以拒絕、而行政院之難題亦將於是發生矣、假使意國竟向阿國進攻、則國聯大會須老慮制裁方法、此項問題將更為困難、至萬不得已之時、國聯或能有下列兩種實力、（一）英國海軍封鎖地中海交通、（二）國際軍隊攻擊意國阿爾帕斯山邊境、至於國際軍隊能否開往阿比西尼亞、則殊難確定、因德國元首希特勒曾要求國聯保護米美爾之人民、免受立陶宛壓迫、倘國聯但顧意國問題、則德國或有强制干涉米美爾問題之可能云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>英與埃及諒解　戰時不侵犯埃及權利</h3>
<p>羅　據可靠消息、埃及政府已得英政府關於戰爭中埃及地位之書面祖任、聞英國允不侵犯埃及權利、並允非先南得埃及政府之同意、不在埃及取任何特別計畫、聞此項担任乃由埃及首相奈西姆與英國駐埃及代理辦事專員會談後而致埃及政府者、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>目前危局　換取集體保安　南愛總統認爲値得</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）各小國現繼續聲明擁護國聯盟約、今日南愛自由邦總統勒拉在國聯大會發言、宣佈南愛恪守義務、並略述國際情感、謂今日國聯滿佈黯淡悽楚景象、與從前所有之高尚旨趣逈不相同、吾人所欲引以為友者、今乃與之為仇、吾人所敬愛者、今乃反對之、事之可痛心者、殆莫此為甚、此乃吾人所將換取集體安全制之代價、然殊值得也、如一個侵略國得行動自由、而他國束手旁視、則轉不若恢復從前聯盟制度之為愈、國聯果值得生存乎、抑應聽其傾覆　、今將以吾人自己之行為决定之云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>波蘭抨擊蘇俄　不滿李維諾夫之言</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會大會今晨十時三十分維續舉行會議、首就行政院半常任會員卽波蘭國連任資格、加以表决、結果總票數五十三票中、投贊成票者達四十五票、因而本日午後大會舉行選舉時、波蘭自必當選連任、</p>
<p>迨投票結束後、愛爾蘭自由邦主席凡列拉卽起立發言、謂集體安全制實乃維持和平之必要條件、愛爾蘭自由邦自當依照國聯會盟約之文字與精神、執行盟約、并要求立卽召集和平會議以解决現行爭端、繼由巴拿馬代表梭立斯起立致詞、謂强國若果許其蔑視國際約束、則國聯會之命運卽威受危險、以故執行盟約及組織集體安全制、皆屬必要之舉、</p>
<p>復次、乃由波蘭代表卽該國外長柏克上校發言、對於蘇聯代表李維諾夫在十四日所發表之演說、提出抗議、其言日、李維諾夫先生曾對某某國締結「雙方協定」之舉、加以攻繫、謂此種辦法含有侵略意圖、實乃對於波蘭政府某項外交步驟肆意批評、余對此種舉動必須提出保留、此種見解、在波蘭政府視之、雖不足介意、第波蘭自國聯會成立以來、卽加入為會員國、余乃以此等老會員國代表之資格、對於此種非常舉動表示詫異、蓋認為國際間誠信合作、可因而為之動搖、而此種誠信合作、又為國聯會進行工作之必要條件也、</p>
<p>旋由海地國代表訥穆宣稱、音阿爭端之解决方案、當以國聯會盟約所載各項原則為依據、此際已屆正午、大會爰乃宣佈總辯論業已結束、奧國代表佛盧格爾男爵忽又起立發言、謂奧國主張各會員國、在事實上皆能當選為行政院會員、因而一般人相信該國在最近之將來、必將提出候選資格、佛盧格爾致詞旣畢、大會卽宣佈休會、時為十二時十五分、并定於午後三時三十分續開、午後大會議程、包括選舉行政院非常任與半常任會員共三席、此外立陶宛代表似將就德國希特勒元首、昨日在該國衆議院所發表之演說、加以評論、蓋以希特勒曾批評米美爾地方之現狀故也、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>意大利　明日又開閣議　兵衆對墨索里尼信仰不衰</p>
<p>（羅馬）據官方今日宣布、意內閣將於星期三再開會議、討論時局之發展情勢、一般人雖信東菲戰事勢所難免、惟歐洲當可不致牽入漩渦法西斯黨員對於國聯方面强有力之表示、雖不無惴惴不安之處、惟對墨索里尼之信仰則仍不衰、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿比本尼亞　動員仍在進行　人心日見恐慌</h3>
<p>阿京　不滿兩週雨季卽將終止、人心日見惶遽、外人商界尤甚、衆恐意軍開戰之初、卽將以飛機直襲阿京、當局刻正從事保護民衆之戒備、許多外人與土人均在其園內開築避彈所、英外相霍爾與法總理賴伐爾在日內瓦所發之演說、固為阿國朝野所歡迎、但衆覺空論與談判之時期行將吿終、目前急宜儘力餒備、以應付不可逸之戰爭、阿皇雅不願施行足以妨礙英怯之舉動、但聞下星期內阿皇與其顧問似將有重要之决議、各部落之戰士二千五百人今晨聚集宮前、表示願為阿皇馳驅、政府僱員多投效陸軍、其職務以女子代之、動員仍在逐步進行中、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英將考慮　保障中歐和平　換取法國援助東菲問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據今日晨報消息、英國內閣現正考慮於相當條件下對法保障中歐之和平、此種保障、外交方面之觀察者早已預料及之、蓋唯如是始能換取法國對意阿問題之援助也、同時英國保衛埃及之行動、亦在進行中、為此滅水雷艦三艘、亦已開往直波羅陀海峽、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據展郵報載稱、內閣或將於本星期內集議、研究英國對於維持中歐和平採取確定約束之可能、所謂確定約束者、係指英國承諾在某種情形下、採取必要措置是也、據該報觀測、「英國政府前雖不願使所負普泛性質之義務、成為確定性質之書面保證、但現可相信、此事是否可能、已由政府加以認眞之考慮矣」、此外工黨機關報每日民聲報、亦謂內閣日夕間即將召開會議、討論在十月二十九日國會復會以前提早召集國會之問題云、（十六日哈瓦斯置）</p>
<p>（巴黎）新聞報對於法國在日內瓦所處之地位深感不安、並疑英國遇他方面發生爭端時、態度是否能如此堅决、謂如此次爭端發生於歐洲、未知英國亦能出持正義否、霍爾外相之演說則未有此項項表示也、英國報紙對此亦守緘默、英國準備在阿比西尼亞採取有力計劃、但如奧國發生事變、未知英國將採何種計劃、法國昔日猶有意國為友、今則較前益形孤立云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外相霍爾於九月十一日在國聯會大會發表演說、主張將世界各地所產原料重行分配、俾未獲殖民地之國家、亦得分享其利、此間實業界、認為霍爾此種建議僅係一種空想、蓋霍爾此項建議、倘欲實施、則僅有兩種方怯、或則由缺乏原料之國家、向殖民國家購得重要原料利益、如是則此等國家、必無償付如許鉅欵之能力、不然、則由富於原料之國家、自動將其一部分和益放棄、若然、則又有兩種困難、蓋放棄原料之國家、如向掌握原料之各公司、出資收買、然後轉讓他國、則政府預算、將增加負担、反之、倘由國家沒收、而不出資收買、則經營原料業之各公司、勢必宣吿破產、例如比屬剛果之上喀丹加鋼鐵鑛、倘收買四分之一、卽需價一萬萬鎊、若由較貧之國家、出資償付、試問何來如是鉅額之外幣乎、至於霍爾主張較富之國家、應向較貧之國家多購貨物、此與目前無組織之經濟趨勢、亦屬格格不相入、自哇太瓦英帝國會議以後、意國菓物及其他物品對英輸出、卽大見削減、以致意國所存外幣减少、卽其明證也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>巴黎報紙　警告墨索里尼　對意國退盟說意見不一</h3>
<p>法國各報對於意國退出國聯之恫嚇、意見不一、時報雖承認大局之嚴重、但謂公報並未封閉一切和平希望之門戶、不過用以饜意國民衆之口味耳、辯論報與時報意見相同、並警吿墨索里尼、謂渠如不接受增固其威望並　足意人合法要求之解决辦法、則將有與共摯友絕交之虞、其他多數報紙皆抱悲觀、謂意國與國聯間之决裂、僅為時間之事、（十六日路透社電）</p>

<h3>荷蘭銀行增高利率</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據此間消息靈通方面聲稱、荷蘭銀行今日增高利率、可為柯立恩政府維持金本位决心之又一明徵、目下盾價殊弱、故此舉非出人意料者、今晨宣布增高利率之前後、荷盾折合英鎊之價格轉堅、同時據當局聲稱、現雖有大批黃金擬運往美國、但此項流出、並不大碍荷蘭銀行之金準備、按照法定、金準備與卽期債務之比率至少為百分之四十、而目下仍在百分之七十左右云、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）德國民衆聞昨日所宣佈之法律、多有震愕異常、如聞晴天霹靂者、卐字旗變為國旗一舉、尤為衆始料所不及、不過外國記者早已料及之矣、老成人對於改換國旗事、傷威頗深、德元首希特勒所稱如新法律不能解决猶太人問題、則將交與國社黨解决之一節、亦引起種種之猜測、昨日大會閉慕時、先唱黨歌後奏國歌、與以前程序不同、此亦可注意事也、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）紐倫堡國社黨大會所通過之新人種法、半官方面之批評極為贊同、略謂自最近在瑞士魯森尼地方召開之國際猶太人大會、公然承認猶太人問題非僅一宗敎不同之問題、而為一人租不同之問題之後、猶太人已成為一特殊之人釋單位矣、故德國今日以猶太人為國境內之少數民族、實根據國際猶太人大會之决議、今次之新法使猶太人得過獨特之文化生活、無論學校戲院運動團體以及其他各種團體、皆不得與德人相混、並不得參加足以影響德國國家政治以及德人利益之問題、此實規定猶太人與德人關係之唯一辦法也、（十六日國民電）</p>

<h3>美海軍開築　太平洋根據地</h3>

<h3>上海　香港國民銀行昨停業　總行周轉部靈奉令同一清理　資產情形尙優社會影響甚少　財部訓令資產繳存銀行公會</h3>
<p>香港國民商業儲蓄銀行、於本月初間、因廣東銀行停業影響、曾一度發生擠提風潮、雖經該行竭力維持、卒以庫存枯竭、經董事會决議、於昨日起、總分行同時停業、聞將改組復業、茲據中央社記者探得各情如下、</p>
<p>創辦　歷史</p>
<p>香港國民商業儲蒂銀行、開業於民國十年、由僑紳馬應彪·湯信·王國漩·鄘明覺·等、聯合各廠商所組織、初定資本二百萬元、（港幣）行址設於香港、自開業以來、營業日見發達、遂於民國十三年將資本定額增為五百萬元、並在上海·廣州，漢口·天津。開設分行、九龍開設支行、外國各大商埠、均設有代理處、專營銀行一切業務、滬分行曾於十七年、加入本市銀行業同業公會為會員、並為聯合準備委員會委員、及票據交換所第二七號交換銀行、並曾向實業部　卅、</p>
<p>董事　經理</p>
<p>該行董事主席為蔡興·董事為馬應彪·湯信·黎邱都明·郭泉·杜澤文·馬祖容·蔡昌·馬永燦·湯蓉耀·譚偽利·唐溢川·林泉和·王國漩·正司理（經理）王國漩·滬行經理原任盧仲淸、於上月內向董事會辭職、另聘黃季巖繼任、於本月初始行到任、</p>
<p>停業　經過</p>
<p>本月初廣東銀行停業、港埠金融界頓起恐慌、國民銀行、在港因與銀行為緊鄰、故亦受影饗、發生擠提、當時總行雖竭力設法、惟以短少現金、故經董事會决議、公吿各存戶、自五日起、準是存欵五分之一、以後再十日兌付五分之一、滬行方面、因情形較佳、故未有風潮發生、且曾解欵前往　急、聞上星期秒、曾召開緊急會議、擬請各董事熟付現欵、以資周轉而各與會董事、則均婉詞拒絕、乃不得已暫行停業、</p>
<p>滬行　情形</p>
<p>當港總行發生風潮時、因電訊傳來、行使甚為緊急、該行滬分行、旣為公會會員、與各會員銀行不無關係、銀行公會方面、為明瞭該行內傾起見、曾由該會秘書長林康侯·前往訪晤該分行經理黃季巖·探詢一切、據其答稱、行雖有風潮、想不久必可平復、而其實際情形、並無電傳之甚、滬分行定期存欵僅三四十萬元、而資產額則超出負債一倍而有餘、故即不幸而被迫停業、各存戶當可十足發還云、故滬分行自由發行生風潮以來、絕無不穩之消息、</p>
<p>通吿　停業</p>
<p>但總行終至現金枯竭、周轉不靈、而被迫停業、昨晨、滬分行並未開業、至九時許、始揭出通吿云、「現奉敝總行董事會電、命敝分行暫行停業、聽候改組、特此佈吿中華民國二十四年九月十六日、上海香港國民銀行啟、」而漢口天津廣州等地分行、亦同時宣吿停業、銀行公會、截至昨夜止、尚未接到該行正式通吿、記者往訪林康侯氏、據其表示、對此項消息、認為不幸、惟以公會未接正式通知、故未有任何舉動、並據林談、滬分行之情形、本無不穩、惟以奉總行命令停業、事前旣未到會請求協助、現實無法救濟云、聞該行準備改組復業、是否有望、實難預料、衆意該行旣經擱淺、恐必至淸理之一怯、</p>
<p>退出　交換</p>
<p>本市銀行聯合準備委員會票據交換所、昨發出第四十五號通吿云、准第二十七號交換銀行香港國民銀行九月十六日函稱、敝行奉總行命、暫停營業、卽日起、暫時退出交換等由、該行旣已停業、所請暫時退出交換一節、自屢卽日起發生效力、除呈報執行委員會並通吿各行査照外、特此通告、經理朱博泉、</p>
<p>資產　負債</p>
<p>據記者査得、該行二十二年之資產負債情况、其總額為一千三百九十餘萬元、其存欵總額約為七百十餘萬元、放欵總額、則為五百十餘萬元、至於實收之資本總額為二百五十七萬四千一百元、公積金二十萬元、該行並曾發行紙幣、至該年底止、各分行發行額僅一萬餘元、觀其收支情形、尚足抵付且存欵旣不多、而發行鈔票亦甚少、故將來淸算時、除各存戶或不免損失外、對一般金融、並無嚴重影響云、</p>
<p>財部　訓令</p>
<p>財政部昨訓令上海銀行業同業公會云、本日上海香港國民商業儲蓄銀行、為受香港總行影響、業已停閉、該行雖未呈經本部註册·但為該會會員銀行·已歷有年所、故本埠各業、與之頗有往來、本部為保障本埠債權人利益、安定市面起見、合亟令仰該公會、迅卽査明該行資負實况、飭其立刻將所有資產、繳存該公會、不得絲毫移動隱匿、並立卽分別變現、以為淸償本埠債務之用、不得稍有違誤、並仰懈電天津漢口銀行公會、一例辦理、此令、</p>

<h3>簡體字在識字　運動上之意義（上）　雷震九月十四日在中央廣播台講演</h3>
<p>識字運動籌備委員會邀我來講幾句話、我今天就借這個機會來談談和識字運動很有關係的簡體字問題、這個問題現在敎育部正在着手推行報紙上也有不少的記載、</p>
<p>中國人一切落後、根本的不能和人家比肩的問題、就是知識相差太遠、知識爲一切事業基礎、我們總是渾渾噩噩的不圖求知、自然難以與人抗衡、普及敎育我們不必談歐美各文明國家、條暹羅這樣的後進的國度裏、他們也能辦到、歐美日本國人民百分之九十九都能識字寫字、我們國土這樣廣大、風俗習慣語言又是各地互異若不急從敎育下手、如何想能維繫民族意識、和建設新興的中國呢、所以普及敎育是目前刻不容綏的事情、而普及敎育的初級工作就是識字問題、我國人口這樣多、文盲的統計雖無確實記載、但大約估計總在百分之七十、國家最多數的人民、都處於目不識丁的地位、這是何等危險的一件事情、自國府奠都南京以來、中央曾規定黨員七項運動中、識字運動就是其一、主持教育的人認爲實行義務教育的基本工作就是要使民衆尤其學齡兒童能够識字寫字、要使這識字　字收效大而易於成功、當要顧及推行這項工作的工具、就是這個工具要有改良的必要、有人主張利用注音符號、有人主張利用簡體字、但是這兩個問題應同時並重、蓋注音符號只能注音到讀的問題、認的問題、簡體字並顧到寫的問題、試需看坊間小說、和鄕井的賬單一般都通用的簡中字以爲記載、可見簡體字之合於一般民衆的要了、</p>
<p>本來文字的功用、就是傳達思想、溝通彼此慼情、記載歷史上的事實、要不過代表語言的符號而已、所以必求其簡單易於明瞭、纔能使功用廣大、到了近代、人事更繁、一切人類生活工具、都在日新月異的改革、以最經濟的方法圖最大的效力、所以文字的改革也漸由繁難而趨向簡便、體外各國文字變遷的原則都是一樣、目的在取其便於記憶、易於書寫、使其適合於人類生活上的需要罷了、現在再舉一個例子說、土耳其六年沿阿拉伯字、而阿拉伯字和土國語言又不一致以致土國人要學寫學讀、至少須費五年至上年工夫、識字的人十人中難得一人、凱末爾深覺得這是普及敎育的最大困難、於是毅然决然通令、從九二九年一月一日起廢止阿拉伯文字而改用適合國情的羅馬字、將六白年來一切官私文書典籍槪更用新字、凱末爾親自執粉筆到各處作識字運動、結果不過幾個星期而學成的人達到　百萬人、至今土國公私上下都稱便利、這亘古未有的文化革命實賴這文字改良的帮助不少、</p>
<p>敎育部爲施行義務敎育推廣社會敎育起見、初具改良文字的擬議後經前國語籌備會提議、擬搜採固有而比較適用的簡體字、編爲簡字　、以便敎育上的需用、研究文字的專家錢玄向、黎劭西·汪一了先生、他們又無忱研究提倡、去年蔣委員長因爲匪區敎育的重要、深感實施不容易、也托敎育部計議推行簡體字、敎部覺得這椿事情、關係很大、不願草率從事、特將這問題交付國語籌備委員會切實審議、大家都認爲現今通用的所謂「正體字」筆畫繁難、書寫費時、實不適宜於現代需要、要想打破這文化上的障碍、確有改良的必要、因此一再討論、徵詢專家、更　得簡體字的推行刻不容緩、因於本年擬定三項辦法、提請行政院會議核准轉呈中央政治會議備案、這是簡體字椎行原則上的經過、（未完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（四八）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>他還沒有再說下去，看衆却巳如受電擊一般，因爲他們只看見唐恩又在空中向後運翻上三個觔斗，幷目以兩手行了一小段的路，頭向地，脚朝犬，這麼一來，便來了聞堂的喝采，韜摩也和着旁人一齊作贊美的呼喊，這超絕的武術家回復了他的直立狀態以後，却以一種沉着的傲氣向他們一瞧。</p>
<p>一面聞摩卻謙和地向他？敎道：你想我能够練得和你一般，却仍不至於多受痛苦？韜摩問時，還在摩控他的臂肘，因爲他的兩個臂肘在最後的一次觔斗以後還在作痛呢。</p>
<p>唐恩却反問道：『假如我敎了你，你給我些什麼呢？』</p>
<p>『我的新摺刀：這裏面有五把小刀，只有一把是壞了的。』</p>
<p>『那末現在京我罷。』</p>
<p>韜摩把它傳了過云，看看它的光滑的柄，猶不無依戀眷惜之情。唐恩把它仔細看過，然曾納它到他的袋裏，走了開去，一霎眠說道：</p>
<p>『只要練習過去，直到學到爲止，另外沒有別的。』</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>一枝鮮紅的蠟炬，放在一邊，不去用它，反被老鼠漸漸吃得祗剩着瘦長的芯骸，這是多麼的可惜！假使我們用火去點着，雖不能像電炬那樣光芒奪目，但在黑暗中，也可放出一綫光明！再轉說到我們為人在社會上，不能受光陰支配，一天一天，把我們的生命剝蝕而致於死；總之，我們在進行的路上，縱不能做轟轟烈烈犬下聞名的大人物，但也得盡一份國民的天職：正如蠟炬雖微末，在黑暗中，也可放一綫光明的！反是，一個人生，如蠟炬白白被老鼠吃光，未免暴殄有用之物，而為世人所不齒哩！</p>
<p>南京路的地基，因建築物的負重，故低窪異常，日前經大雷雨之後，致水深沒踝；由是連想到飢餓綫上的人們，誰的肩頭上，不壓着一家老小的重擔，再在這不景氣的年頭裏，自然曲背彎腰，無病呻吟。地低積水，祇要溝渠使其暢流，不使其污塞，自可無積水之虞：社會上雖滿佈暮氣，但從振興實業，抵塞漏巵，救濟失業羣衆等項，着手做起，大家吃飽肚皮，「杭育」！「杭育」！挑着擔兒，是多麼的精神飽滿而有力！這樣，也許國家與社會有復興的一日啊！</p>
<h3>電話考</h3>
<p>— 吉安</p>
<p>住在都市裏的人，電話大概誰都要應用的吧？尤其自從最近發生了軍話加價問題之後，這握着都市通話消息的電話，更成為大衆所討論的問題，所注意的事情了。</p>
<p>但是電話這東西，它到底在什麼時候，才在上海裝置？它的沿革怎樣？這是我們應該知道的事。</p>
<p>根據徐雨之先生的上海雜記上說：電話之在上海，是在前淸光緒六年，卽西曆一八八一年的時候，才有德律風公司的創立，發明人為皮息氏，（此係外國人，隸何國籍，已不可考。）自此以後，招商局乃於光緒八年，卽西暦一八七八年，裝設局用電話，與各公事房及碼頭通話，從此以後，商塲乃逐漸裝設德律風，而成商業上不可少之工具焉。</p>
<p>在這一段記載上看來，可知電話之在上海，已經有了五十餘年的歷史了。而現在的電話，裝置得更為進步，這實在是人類的福音，爰作電話考，以吿一般不知上海之電話歷史者。</p>
<h3>做模特兒的伯爵夫人</h3>
<p>— 貢</p>
<p>法國巴黎有一位伯爵夫人，近因乃夫去世，為了維持生活起見，更名蓓蒂，在夏芭蘭服裝公司做模特兒。</p>
<p>這位蓓蒂小姐，生得似花如玉。金黃色的頭髮，柔滑的肌膚，蔚藍色的媚眼，是一個典型的瑞士美人。早年就學於谷頓堡，卽擅長英法兩國的語言。曾到過各處遊歷，歐洲各地，幾無不有伊的芳院。</p>
<p>去年伊到巴黎，和一個法國的伯爵結了婚，不幸，經過了一年的快樂的結婚生活，這位伯爵患病去世了。他所遺下來的，只是一個空銜頭，並無什麼財產。蓓蒂於是孤零零的一個人住在巴黎。為生活計，不久便做了模特兒。</p>
<p>有一天，某報記者前去訪問，伊有如下的陳述：</p>
<p>「我從丈夫亡故以後，簡直無以為生。我又沒有半個錢。我是愛穿漂亮衣服的，於是决定到服裝公司去做模特兒，雖然過去對於這門騷業並沒有什麼經騐，也只好冒險試試了。」</p>
<p>「起初，我常面紅耳赤」，伊自己承認說，「但現在則處之泰然了。人們雖然兩眼不霎地像餓鷹釘着我看，我毫不介意了。這種生活，倒也快樂，因為吃的穿的都十分滿意，而且收入也不差啊。假使一個女人在法國沒有特殊的生活技能，這種職業是最好不過的了，我現在想。我並不想以做模特兒終我的一生，我想對於服裝事業方面，學得一些智識。並且希望有脫頴而出的一天，那時做此不失掉我的個性的事情。」</p>
<p>「我的最大的夢想是希望將來我會到美國去，並且在那裏生活下去。」伊最後這樣說。</p>
<p>經過了六個月的模特兒生活，蓓蒂的名字已為全巴黎的人所知道了。都認為伊是巴黎最出色的模特兒，尤其因為表演穿晚裝時候的技巧和姿態，最使人們心醉。</p>
<p>蓓蒂的身材，不高不矮，恰如其份。臉微瘦，蛋圓形。鼻小而尖直，微笑時羞人答答，微露伊的編貝似的牙齒。伊不喜歡過分用人工的化裝，僅用少許脂粉，就已經嬌艷過人了。</p>
<p>蓓蒂平日的生活，也很淡樸。吃的是果子露和蔬菜，不大吃肉，工餘之暇，喜運動和電影，但不希望做電影明星。目下也沒有再醮的念頭。</p>

<p>至於擠上梯子來了的兩個人那倒算不了什麼不足為奇。你沒有看到我在樓上向他們大聲疾呼嗎？這事在目前，總算過去了，料着他們也不好意思再鼓噪過來。只是有一層，怕他們把這消息送到報館裏去了，明天報上登了出來却是專員盛名之累。裘則誠見他無端擠了過來，明知道他就是借事邀功，很不願意和他交談，只把兩眼瞪着他。及至他說到報館這件事，不由動了心，便問道：你何以知道有這一著？介夫向樓下看看，人還不曾散盡，帳房正圍着一四個人在一處說話，便低聲道：自然是眞。怎麼仙們還沒有散？我再去　勸解勸。他說着這話，嗤溜一下，就下了樓。見着賈多才板了臉站在自己門邊，就迎上前，低聲笑道：其實一位專員，也沒有什麼了不得，幹嗎，發這樣大威風？賈多才淡笑道：好在他作啞烏龜，不說一個字了，要不然，請他下不了台。介夫笑道：你去休息，值得生　閑氣，陪着　太太多好？賈多才笑了。介夫回　頭來，又看到周有容也背了手站在一邊淡笑，又改着就了他說話。也低聲道：這樣的專員不是替中央洩氣嗎？西安這地方，不是小鎭小縣，他可駭不着人。周有容笑道：算他便宜，今天沒碰着武裝同志。介夫又敷衍了幾句閑話，回頭還看到裘　誠站在欄干邊，　就二次上樓來。（三一七）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>日本的海水浴</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>我國的習慣，到了夏天，大人先生們都專到靑島廬山等地去避暑，消遣他炎熱的暑期。日本的風氣，略有不同，在夏天不是爬山便是游泳。因爬山而遭難的，已數見不鮮，但是繼起者仍是不絕。日本人好活動，絕對不會如我國人會淸靜的安居在山中，海邊，一天到晚讀書散步，欣賞目然的風景。</p>
<p>日本四周都是海洋，海水浴塲，觸目都是。只要稍稍整理設備，便可成為很好的游泳塲。况且鄉間生活低廉，無都市的　囂，所以中等以上的人家，不他到深山裏去，便是到海邊去。日本交通便利，凡是名勝古蹟均有汽車火車運輸遊客。所以到了夏天沿海岸的鄉問陡然熱鬧起來了。鄉人便兼營各種小商業，推銷土產，或是出租房。在這短短的暑期中間，很能賺幾個錢，以補家用。所以對外來的遊客，十分歡迎招待，在火車站旁就有招待處，專為遊家解决食住行的三大問題，使遊客不感人地生疏的苦痛。商會市公所等組織了慰勞會，親自登門來感謝遊客，並聽取對海岸設備的缺點，以便改良。</p>
<p>日本游泳滬術的普及，也足驚人，五十歲的老太婆也穿了游泳衣在作海水浴。一三歲的小孩，已由父母携着在沙灘上玩耍。我國的留學生，大都不諳游泳術，無不臨時請人敎授，普通均不能和他們的小孩子爭勝，毋怪遠東運會的游泳，我國老是落後的。海水雖然平靜得像處女一樣，但是在不會游泳欲的人看來，宛如嚙人的惡魔，自從靑年作曲家聶耳游死之後，此種不幸事件，又接連發生了兩三次，都是因為平日不諳水性的關係。日本人在小學校的時候，便有林間學校和海濱學校，所以日本人對爬山游泳的常識都有相當的普及。</p>
<p>除女子均穿游泳衣外，男子和小孩，大都只用一塊黑布繫在胯下罷了，這是簡便辦法在歐美各國也不多見的。我國女同胞原來連日本浴堂也不敢進去的，現在居然赤了兩條大腿，很自然的同男朋友一塊兒玩着，已絕無怕羞的現家了。但是活潑豐滿，總覺不及日本的女兒，這是大家都感覺得到的。</p>
<p>在海水裏浸了多少時候，便到沙灘上曬太陽，於是皮膚使漸漸的黑起來了。初到海邊的人們，皮膚白晳，雜在許多黑人中間，反而覺得異樣的不能調和。皮膚受了幾天日光曬炙以後，便要發紅作痛，連夜裏都不能安睡。以後便慢慢的脫　發黑，尤其是兩個肩頭，皮脫得要流血一樣的可怕。這樣的鍜鍊，宛如鐵匠練鋼，身體那有不强壯堅實之理。</p>
<p>曬太陽時唯一的消遣，是玩沙和拾蚌。小孩子們把沙泥，堆成山嶺城堡隧道等種種模型。有時把身體全葬在沙裏，只露出一個頭。旁邊的朋友，把沙堆成各種裸體造像。日本是公共衛生普及的國家。蒼蠅雖然不多，但是鄉下的蚊蟲，却不亞於吾國，絕不怕蚊烟香的烟幕。在夜裏遊各受不了蚊蟲的襲擊，只好四出散步，消磨他的黃昏時候，那是海岸又變了納凉去處了。附近的商界，放着無綫電歌曲，遊客們就圍着幾盞燈龍下面，跳着日本踊。有時各界商店聯合起來，請了一班藝妓在海邊上跳舞，或是開映滑稽電影，以餉遊客。這樣旣可振興了夜裏的市面，又可减少遊客的寂寞。日本的商人，總是盡力迎合大　的心理，所以商業得以發達。</p>
<p>我國海水浴塲不多，各地游泳池又少，所以國人對游泳術，十分幼稚。但游泳可使全身肌肉平均發達，增加皮膚的抵抗能力。海水浴益處更大，日本人民體格之所以較我國壯健，這也是一憫重要的原因吧。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我最初聽到這些謠言時，很想盡力代伊闢謠，把伊服食人乳的眞相昭吿天下，但我再三考慮之下，又覺不妥。因為服食人乳的一種習慣，原是絕不平常的，人們聽了，也許將分外得意構成種種謠言來。記得我進宮後第二日早上，瞧着伊把那麼一杯人乳喝下了肚去，心上眞覺得有些異樣的不安，竟以為太后是一個善於害人的「老妖怪」，伊的喝人乳就等於魔鬼們的喝人血，那個擠乳汁給伊喝的乳母，不久也許就會枯竭而死；但這些恐怖的猜度，後來便漸漸地消滅了。其實除却這事而外，宮內也儘有許多非常特別的事情，祗要你處得稍久一些，便自能知道它是無足為害於人的，從此安之若素了；可是最初發見的時候，那是的確要使每個人都覺得怪可疑的。</p>
<p>但是最緊要我們得問一問　服食人乳畢竟能否發生駐顏的功效？依我說，是能够的，誰敢說不能呢！旣然一個初出世的嬰孩在服食人乳之後，便能漸漸地長成起來，於此便可見人乳確是一種富於滋補的東西；而且我們試看正在哺乳時期的嬰兒，它們底膚色總是非常的白潤，那末人乳能使一個已入暮年的老婦人的容色重復轉為白潤，也是大有可能的事。那末我們為什麼看到一個老年人在服人乳就要起那種無謂的疑懼呢？何况這個老年人自已旣已確信人乳是足鴅帮助伊挽住那正在跨着大步走過去的年華的，則在伊服食的時候，心理上　有一種信仰，精神上也必比較愉快；我們都知道凡服食一種我們對它具有信仰的藥餌，　效往往就分外的靈速，人乳何獨不然！（四一七）</p>

<h3>話說傻瓜</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>在我們平常說話裏，笑人太老實，或者駡人有幾分蠢氣，每每說人傻頭傻腦，叫人傻子，傻瓜。傻字的原來意義，據字書說，輕慧貌，並不是形容人不懂事或者無知識。然而這個字失掉牠的原來意義已經很久了。我想傻讀沙上聲，形容粗鄙的人叫做沙塊，或單說沙，這是某一時代某一地方的方言，寫出來，大家不容易懂，所以後人行文的時候借用一個傻字，至今就久假不歸了。究竟沙字是那個時代那個地方的方言呢？據宋江鄰幾雜志說：</p>
<p>廛俗呼野人爲沙塊，未詳其義，士大夫亦頗道之。永叔戲長文賢良之選，旣披沙而揀金，吳頗憾之。遷怒於原父云，某沙於心，不沙於面，君侯沙於面，而不沙於心。愈怒焉。</p>
<p>又嘗戲爲遵，舊日沙而不哨，如今哨而不沙。</p>
<p>大約駡人爲沙，北宋時代，汴京地方，已經很流行了。所以歐陽永叔，吳長文，劉原父一班人，互相譏諷爲沙。沙和哨的意義是相反的，正和如今的口頭語裏傻氣和俏皮的意義相反一樣。沙塊是指普通一班粗鄙的人，至於粗鄙的軍人，那個時侯叫做赤老。同書又說：</p>
<p>都下鄙俗，目軍人爲赤老，莫原其意，緣尺籍得此名耶？狄靑自延安入樞府西府，迓者累日不至，問一路人，不知乃狄子也。旣云未至，因謾駡日，迎一赤老，累日不來。士人因呼爲赤樞。伯庸常戲其湼文云，愈更鮮明。狄答云，莫愛否？奉贈一行。王大慙恧。</p>
<p>至今上海人還是每每駡人赤老，好像北京人歡喜駡人傻瓜一樣。湖南方言叫愚蠢的人爲塊老，或者是由沙塊轉變而來；又叫沙頭，沙氣，或單叫沙，但沙讀作梭去聲：行文的時候，還是寫作優，却不知道是沙字一聲之轉。又記得楚辭九辯裏有「塊　守此無澤兮，仰浮雲而永歎」的話，我疑塊字是楚語，自謙之辭，如後人自稱爲愚，塊老是從古代楚語裏流傳下來的也未可知。</p>
<p>湖南人還有一句駡人的俏皮話，叫人爲「五十三兩」。那是因爲從前使用銀塊的時候，通常大寶（又稱元寶）一錠是五十三兩。駡人大愚叫大寶，周折說來，就叫「五十三兩」。有時也駡人做寶貝，或者單駡爲寶。我想賓字原來或作呆。呆音保，古保字。大戴禮，「上之親下也如腹心，則下之親上也，如保子之見慈母也。」保子是不懂事的孩子。今湖南方言有時駡人傻子爲包子，我想包子或者就是保子。或者說，包子和餛飩同類，餛飩音同混沌。說人混沌爲包子，這是周折之辭。今人讀呆若獃。元人雜劇有「呆打孩」一語，把呆假作痴獃的獃，可見由來已久了。又獃有時讀作騃，痴獃也作痴騃。</p>
<p>在湖南，又有時把痴獃的人或者軟弱可欺的人叫做粲頭，一作孱頭。前者的意義是譏其爲人僅僅外面漂亮，後者的意義如稱儒夫，弱哥。又有惡駡人的諺語道；「老蟲（虎也）交猪入的，又蠢又倔。」倔是倔强的意思，倔讀若拙。又一把痴肥或笨拙的人叫做笨公。晋書載豫章太守史疇以大肥　爲笨伯，笨公就是笨伯一樣的意思。</p>
<p>再，在我們鄉下，每每稱讀書人爲書憨子，不是讀書人也有時稱憨子，好像上海話叫人戇大或戇頭一樣。便是叫你書憨子，也不是美稱，好像別的地方稱書獃子。不過憨子兩字有時可以代替先生兩字，比如你叫趙先生，就可叫作趙憨子，叫的不算失禮，受的並不生氣，倒比稱先生來得親切些。歐陽修的歸田錄裏說：</p>
<p>太宗時，有待詔賈玄，以棋供奉，號爲國手，邇來數十年，未有繼者。近時有李憨子者，頗爲人所稱，云舉世無敵手。然其人狀貌昏濁，垢穢不可近，蓋里巷庸人也，不足置之樽俎間。故胡旦嘗語人曰，以棋爲易解，則如旦聰明；尙或不能；以爲難解，則愚下小人往往造於精絕。信如其言也！</p>
<p>可見憨子的稱呼由來已久，同時也可以知道憨子是昏庸愚下的別名。吾鄕農民每每譏笑一般書憨子爲「破夜壺」，「桐油罐」，以爲毫無用處。倘若改爲空洞的文言，那就是說「百無一用是書生」，書生只算是廢物了！</p>
<h3>入陜見聞錄</h3>
<p>— 倚萍</p>
<p>我們休息了半小時，道七即在龍王面前點起香燭，放着兩把嶄新錫製的像葫蘆一樣的空酒壺。縣長和一行祈雨的衆人，跪在龍王而前，稽首作揖；道士跪在左邊，右手拿着兩塊求卦所用的竹根，他向龍王叩頭以後，說道：</p>
<p>「長久沒有下雨，人民心裏很不安，今天本縣縣長老爺和師爺們特別到你老人家前祈雨，你老人家如能在午時下雨，請來一聖卦。」</p>
<p>他說着隨即將手內的竹卦擲去。</p>
<p>「陽卦，旁邊的農民說。</p>
<p>陽卦是龍王爺拒絕縣長的要求。於是道士照樣說了兩遍，竹卦擲了兩次，都得不到聖卦。道士請縣長燒了黃紙，再求何時可以取水。結果，求得准在酉時。道士即將兩把空酒壺拿着，在每把壺頸上縛着紅綫繩，走到龍洛邊，把牠倒放在水底；繩的十　，　在岸上。我問道：</p>
<p>這幹什麼？</p>
<p>「到酉時酒壼浮起來，才可取水。」道士回答說。</p>
<p>空酒壺那裏會沉到水底？在水底的酒壺，如何會浮到水面？其實道士放酒壺入水時，已把水灌入，他去取壺只消把壓岸上的繩一拉，酒壺自然被拉上了。鄕人迷信，却以爲龍王爺的靈騐！</p>
<p>時間還沒有十二點鐘，龍王爺准許取水的時間，却在酉時，我們只好在山麓一家農民家中等着，一面差人到城于裏去取食物來充飢。</p>
<p>到五點鐘，道士將酒壺拿起，裝了兩壺水，吊在柳枝紮成的三角架的尖端，上面再蓋着一把柳枝，山四個農民抬着，我們跟在後面回城，把取來的兩壼龍水，放在城隍著薩的供桌上，即有道士喃喃地唸着經　，　起香　，供上，</p>
<p>空，沒有一點雨意。城內的老　姓就編着一　柳樓龍，由　　個靑年，神頭赤星，　着一修　　，　　　　　　，在街上　　　　五個人勁的　着沒有拍調的鑼鼓。各店夥就將店門前放着大木桶內的水，一勺勺地向跳龍的人們潑去，他們滿身淋漓，好像落湯一樣。</p>
<p>我呆呆地看着，心想，天不下雨，可以求得嗎？（完）</p>
<h3>腦力與體力</h3>
<p>— 嚴以霖</p>
<p>據說大哲人柏拉圖Plato）在未遇見蘇格拉底（Socrates）以前，竟是一個闊肩膀的戰士，而日在易特密亞的競技中（IsthmianGamts）曾獲得兩次錦標。</p>
<p>這樣的一個角力戰士却變爲哲學家，不能不算是奇聞。</p>
<p>大凡是角力，競技中的戰士，似平不再是思想　中的士：這句話　於　在世間，不至於會錯到怎樣地步。由此可見腦力與體）（並代表軀的健及　　。）　是不平　　，互爲矛盾的。</p>
<p>體育家有着極堅强的體軀，異常的大力，便難得有一個靈敏的腦袋，——當然也有例外。反之；思想家有善於思考的頭腦，從而具有思維方法，研究力以及判斷力，他們的身體常常是衰弱的；有了最聰明的頭腦的人，他的身體也許是瘦弱得令人難於相信。</p>
<p>這自非良好的現象。</p>
<p>腦力與體力之間，應保住相當的平衡，使兩者調和起來；——這並不是說體育家應兼有思想家的腦袋，而思想家則兼有體育家的體軀，但這自是最高的理想。——使大家得以合理的發展。</p>
<h3>憶湛山道上</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>兩年來沈陷在污濁的都市裏，同想起昔年的湖海飄游，眞可說已如隔世了。秋初涼，看着人從勝地避暑回來，不免頓起感觸。固然我過去乃至未來，都未曾與未必有勝地避署的幸氣與閒興，但有此勝地，我却因經行之便，曾留下過蹤跡，例如靑島，那裏月餘的勾留，仍時留在我的記憶裏。</p>
<p>已說過，我不是那裏去避暑的，我到那裏　是中秋節後，那年的秋天凉得早，我到時避暑的人已走盡了，因之幷未看到活潑美麗的靑島。但我想也無須怎樣怨悔吧，海是一樣的藍，山是一樣的靑，幷不對孤獨的游人敗歛起笑容，或者這寂寞的旅客倒反是可以幾乎獨佔江山的秀色自傲的。說獨佔，幷不是怎樣過份的，不說那比較偏僻的地方，就是很整齋的第一公園裏，有幾次我去散步時，也一問游人都沒有遇到。</p>
<p>第一公園人得　，就所佔的平地說，似乎　遜於就在牠前面的跑馬　，但依山的這一面，簡直是漫無界限，遍山上又都是葱茂的林木，實已不屬於公園的範圍，仍然是可與公園等視的。靑島　也是風，區，但牠的基礎，到底是建築在商業上的，在靑島造別墅的人，大致也不外是此富商上買，他們的屋，向來都是建築在比較然鬧的處所。這公園四周的山上難好，他們的目光尙沒有看　。不過因　漸的發展，公園　北于面，也已有了一些建築，又兩年來，情形或者更有點異樣了吧。如果現在京山路的西邊，巳列滿了　屋，那恐怕立在京山路上，看過了公園，看過了跑馬塲，看過海滇，一直看到過處的海島那樣曠闊的境界，已不很容易爲游人所享受了吧。</p>
<p>由公園上京山路，穿過靑島大學回寓所是最近而又易走的一路，這條路我是常走的。這條一路熟悉之後，我開始想沿着公園四面（？）的山間的路繞行一次。京山路的西盡頭，可說是個十字路，向西入靑島大學，向北通過大學後面的靑島山，向南則是穿過公園及跑馬塲西面一帶小山的山脊的福山路。我知道福山路的南端是俑魚山路的，第二天就山魚山路向福山路走。</p>
<p>沿福山路走，可以看到靑島的莆華。西而貯水，督府，扯旗，觀象諸山，遮起了實際的勞苦的靑島，東西的湛山，又把界外的荒凉隔絕。在這上而住着的人，一定是整犬做着美麗的夢的，其中自然也有些是高貴的華人，但多　是外國的僑民，本國人知道靑島太遲，已來不及獲得最好的地段，也就做不着最美麗的夢了。</p>
<p>福山路最北端西的　峯，立在靑島大學所居的山坳之南，與坳西的扯旗山對立，這兩屬都是靑島境內僅有的幾乎連草也沒有的禿峯。本來靑島各山的樹木都是人工經營出來的，這兩座大槪是故意留下的原夾的樣本。扯旗山本是留作眺望，自然無須樹木，至於這一座的留着原樣，就不知是什麼理山，或者從前也是爲軍事上的需要，但現在也逐漸變成住宅區了。</p>
<p>走盡福山路入京山路後，因爲是走慣的路，就故意向較小的路走。幾個轉折就發現一听？墓。原來這生人尙未知道來享受的佳培裏，刦早已有了死人之家。當時我想，亦生前到靑島下居的希望，大概是不見得能有的，若想在此地佔一片墓地，或者還不是什麼奢望。這幻想誠不免有點荒誕，但在引人起出世思想的境界，心境的趨向寂滅，也幷不深足懷異吧。</p>
<p>山公墓間的小　再轉入大道，就到京山路與湛山路的分界。左右俱是約冉有三百尺高的山峯，有峯間可以看到遠處的平野與村莊，沿西峯的腰有大路直通釗那平野。我佔計這條路是在靑島山的背後，那麼那村莊或就靑島極北的台東鎭。如然，我就想改變原來的計劃，打這裏去台東鎭再轉回去。就這時我看見有人打那路上向我這裏走，因此我在下待着。但從那人那裏得到的相反的同答，那村莊是十五累的遠處，離台東鎭又還有十餘里，這可未免太遠了，而這人又剛好是去湛山道上，於是我决定同他一處走了。</p>
<p>沿湛山一面的樹木，長得特別茂盛，公鬨巳被遮在樹林裏面，但不時從樹隙裏督見草地，房屋，與池塘，頗覺別有趣味。約裏在半里路，大路經過一倏山枝，路是切開山枝而通過的，兩邊都約有一人高。山枝北是公園，山枝南就是一個荒峪。峪裏怪石嵯峨，在上的苔蘇碧綠，隱約可見石間流着淸泉。山脚下有不少人家，但不是近代的建築，而是舊式的村居，其附近却又立着雄健建築的第一中學。在這中學內，幷不覺得其所處的地位優美，現在從山上看下，就迥不相同了。</p>
<p>山路沿山腰　到　南，就逐漸是下山的阪道。在高峯轉盡，前面另立着一低峯處，就分出兩倏岔道，一條大概是通中學那面，一條出峯後通靑島境外。路完全是劈山而築，大槪是爲行軍時的隱密，才不　　此巨功的。對於遊人，這　路實在不受歡迎，我到這裏，就爬上路的外段，在堤脊上建强行走。這樣靑島的境外，遂都入目。固然疎落地也有一些西式建築，但總印象已是片郊野。遠處固還　靑山，近邊却是頗空闊的平野，空着的田隴露着黃土，大風揚起滿天的灰　。然而矚目遠處，單看成列的靑山，還是不覺察這北方氣的枯燥的。秀麗的風景，很彷彿在杭州的由琅璫嶺去五雲的大道上看浙西的羣山。</p>
<p>湛山大道一直通到海邊。在離海邊不遠處和回靑島的大路交义，這路名我巳記不得了，我也不曾沿着這曲折的路走，遇着岔出的路我就岔出去，往往走上，節才發現是條豐路，重有走回，但最後終於從一條新開穿過密林的大路走到滙泉角西。人已倦了，並目那滙泉角由的砲臺也已去過，於是就闌珊回寓。在跑馬塲南的路上，回顧我所經行的山路，除開福山路一節不計，共經過五個山頭。可說是一個偉大的國林了，自覺這一日的遊程的辛苦值得。</p>
<p>現在第回憶起靑島來，湛山道上的這一天，還每每是我最先憶起的。</p>

<p>莫里太太是一個屠戶的女兒。她是一偭很能涵蓄的女人：一個果斷的女人。她嫁給了她父親的管事，在春園附近開了一家肉店。可是岳父一死，莫里先生就開始放蕩了。他喝酒，盜用本錢，負了一身的債。要他發願戒酒是沒有用的：幾大以後他一定重新破戒。由於在顧客的面前和他的老婆打架，山於收買壞肉，他使生實零落了。有一天晚上他用屠刀去追擊他的老婆而她祇好睡在鄰人　裏。</p>
<p>那次以後他們分居了。她走到收帥那裏，和他離了婚，孩子們由她照管。錢，食物想住室，她都不給他：因此他祇得去充當一個郡長的從人。他是一個襤樓的駝背的小酒徒，有白的面孔和白的　　和描畫在他的紅腫的小眼睛上面的白的眉毛：他整天坐在從人室，等待驅使。莫里太太收拾了肉店生意中的餘資，在哈德威克街開了一家寄宿舍，她是一個堂堂的女人。她的宿舍有一批流動無定的住客，裏向有從利物沛，從「人之島」來的漫遊者，偶然也有從音樂廳來的　人。長居的住客是城中的小職員們。她靈巧地穩定地管理着宿舍，知道什麼時　可以賒賬，什麼時候要嚴厲，什麼時　要馬虎。一切長居的靑年人者呌她做一馬丹一。</p>
<p>莫里太太的靑年住客們每個禮拜付她十五先令膳令費（晚餐的啤酒和烈性麥酒在外）。他們有同樣的趣味和職業，因爲這個緣故，他們大家都很親暱。他們互相討論着競技塲中的常勝者和門外漢的成敗。馬丹的兒子賈克。莫里是艦隊街的一位經理的書記，他有一個難於管束的名聲。他歡喜用兵十們的猥褻的話：常常要到破曉的時候才回家來。他會見他的朋友時，他總有許多的話告訴他們，的確他總知道一些事情——就是說，他知道一匹咶咶呌的馬，或者一位咶咶呌的藝人。他又長於鬥拳，唱詼諧的歌。禮拜天的夜晚，莫里太太的前面客應裏常常舉行聚會。音樂廳的藝人們常來助興；雪利東奏着華爾茲和波卡的舞曲，相和而歌。馬丹的女兒波利。莫里也唱着歌，她唱：</p>
<p>「我是一個……淘氣的女兒，</p>
<p>你不要裝佯：</p>
<p>你知道我。」</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>國聯常任理事有什么用處？</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>十三日路透電，中國申請國聯行政院理事席，國聯行政院今晚秘密會議中，曾討論中國在行政院獲得一半常任理事一案，但並無議决，此事似不致提出於本屆國聯大會會議，至少又將延宕一年，這一件事，似未免令入失望。</p>
<p>但是我不懂得做了國聯的會員國，有什麼用處？做了國聯行政院的理事，又有什麼甩處？故要做國聯行政院的理事，而必須請求，旣可不必，要做國聯行政院半個常任理事，而去請求，更可不必，因爲做了國聯的會員國，必須負担國聯的一筆偌大經費，而結果所得到的是什麼呢？眞是寃枉孹障。</p>
<p>國聯組織的目的是什麼？操縱國聯的中堅份子是那幾國？我姑且不去問他，但是從九一八以來，國聯的成效是怎樣，國聯所能行使的權威又是怎樣，我國忝爲國聯會員國之一，所獲得國聯的助力，究有幾分之幾，這篇賬且提開不談。現在的阿比西尼亞，不是國聯的會員國麽？現在的國聯，不是對於阿國用盡九牛二虎之力以帮他的忙麽？但是不帮猶可，一帮則眞是越帮越忙了。</p>
<p>請看！八日倫敦電，處理意阿問題之國聯行政院五國小組會議，現正考慮對於阿比西尼亞，實施一種保護制度，以阿國歸意國保護。又十三日巴黎電，五國小組委員會，大約將給予意國以一種新保障，俾意國在阿比西尼亞佔有經濟及政治之優勢，其辦法將採取委任統治制度，這樣一來，阿國的經濟政治，均受意國的支配，則阿國獨立國家的資格，已完全送掉。並且就這樣辦法，意國還沒有滿意而接受呢。</p>
<p>就從這一點看來，做國聯的會員國有什麽用處？不做國聯的會員國有什麽害處？阿國倘不做國聯的會員國，至多亦不過亡國而止，現在做了國聯的會員國，亦仍不免於亡，故我說担任國聯會員國的經費，落得省省吧，現在我國申請做國聯行政院半個常任理事，我想大可不必。</p>
<h3>梅子心境</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>又是令人精神困倦得發霉的梅雨季節了。</p>
<p>梅雨把一列翠烟牢鎖在小窗前一株洋梧桐樹枝上，枝葉和一顆覇旅的客心在搖曳，我無端地而又似有意地唸起那首詩來：</p>
<p>——梅子黃時濺齒牙，芭蕉分綠上窗紗：兒童未解供耕織，也傍桑陰學種瓜。</p>
<p>在故鄉，梅子黃，芭蕉綠的時候，犁田的水聲，織布的梭聲，便展開了農村的二重奏；那調子是高亢的，淸脆的，一片黃金世界，便由那單純的，樸實的旋律織綴出來。</p>
<p>我是未解耕織的兒童，因爲連年牧牛的專任，我血液中彷彿羼挿了足分原始底遊牧的野性，一到山崗，便像池魚躍入了大海，漫山遍谷地奔跑，呼嘯起來，梅子樹旁，便是我們週期戰爭的戰塲了。的確，在牧童的生活史上，誰都牢記着一年一度的「梅子戰爭」呢！</p>
<p>梅子樹莖不很高，也許爲了保護繁衍的子孫，遍身長着刺。枝葉閃着遮陽的傘形，一簇簇金黃梅子，綴繫有油滑的綠葉叢中，就像燦爛的繁星倒垂在淺藍的天慕上。熟梅子味是甜中帶酸，吃過後唇舌上威覺一陣麻木，然而那時候的我們，誰知道那就是人生的眞實况味！</p>
<p>由於地理的關係，我們一羣是住在一方澄潭的北面的，而僅隔盈盈一水的南面的牧童，便天然作了我們的敵人，雖然我們沒有天才標出湖北派和湖南派鮮明我們的旗幟，但湖南派的人偶來北面，總不想逃出我們的圍攻。不過　種仇視，只有在梅子黃時特別尖銳，迨到時過境遷，也就和好如初了。</p>
<p>在這一羣中我是較有高大的身體，過人的野性，於是我便被推爲湖北派的首領了。照例我們總有六七天守到梅樹</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>旁，從早到晚，有時甚至連午飯也不回家吃，謹防江南派小子們來愉摘，直到梅子粒粒皆滾下了我們的肚皮，才得解除戒嚴的警衛。因爲梅樹生在山中，所以石子，樹枝，全是「取之小盡，用之不竭」的武器，關於武器的補充和準備，我們已派了幾個專員負責，事先便把石子聚攏來，用樹葉遮蔽敵眼，再把結實而又苗條的小樹砍下來，削光了節疤暗藏在樹蔭裏，此外刀箭麻繩，應有盡有。守着，守着，在渴望的眼裏，瞧見梅子由碧綠而淡黃，而金黃，有的耐不住如年的長日，便要摘取一二粒暫壓飢涎，涎水沾了酸涎，更滿口泛濫起來。要那樣才有味道，在幼稚的心靈上，那才是值得做的工作。</p>
<p>江南派自然野心勃勃地窺伺其旁，有時也從叢林中竄出一兩隻小偷眼，經我們一聲呼嘯，便又一溜從叢林中溜跑了。我們彷彿做了那排梅樹的主人。</p>
<p>是一個朝露初歛的早晨，晴和的陽光啟示我們是梅子的收穫的一天，忙地吃過早飯，不約而同的到了山裏。在前面的幾個人突然大叫起來，因爲江南派幾個小子想坐享其成的在樹上摘取了。我一聲令下，使大夥兒跑步前進，不料他們也早有準備；樹蔭下的伏兵全衝出衆，於是哭喊聲，木石的碰擊和飛射，形成一塲血戰，戰鬥結局，做首領的我受傷了，可是梅子終給我們佔有了，帶着傷痕吃梅子，心理雖有無上的光榮，但梅子味仍舊是甜中帶酸。</p>
<p>每逢梅雨季節，總使我想到幼時一年一度的「梅子戰爭」和梅子味道，七八年浪蕩天涯的生活史篇，也是梅子味道，由這味道訓練了我的梅子心境，我想　梅子心境，不會給我一個人佔有的罷，假如你心靈不願意做你軀殼的俘虜的話。</p>
<p>我願意這梅子心境在廣大的軀殻羣中存在着啊！</p>
<h3>燈會</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>小姐姐看過一次燈會，　前年　　卽。那年屋後米棧裏的　　出小姐姐那開了爸爸的心，他撫着小姐姐一頭烏油的頭髮說：又大一歲了，乖乖，到月半（元宵）帶你到城裏看燈會。</p>
<p>小姐姐那年才五歲，家裏又沒有兄弟姊妹，她至多搜覓一點破布零條，坐在小矮凳上學着母親的樣，算做衣服。乖乖被爸爸一說，她不定心了，每天扭着媽問過幾天才是月半？</p>
<p>十五那天，小姐姐一早逼着爸爸要進城了。告訴她燈會要到晚上才有，乖乖却我要到姑姑家里去玩。她姑姑是嫁給城里做雜貨店老闆娘的。</p>
<p>這一天小姐姐像她爸爸看見滿米棧的穀一般樂着。姑姑家有比她大一歲的姐姐，雜貨店爲　時起見，紮了許多小型的花燈，姐妹兩個兒要了一盞，白天點上燈燭，前堂後屋跑個不了。</p>
<p>姑姑的雜貨店開在大街上，毘鄰都是城里挺大的舖子：老大房，德成銀樓，大盛綢緞局，大家勾心鬥角紮着各種奇異的燈彩。一到晚上，燈火通明，那種熱鬧的情形小姐姐的爸爸還是第一次看到呢。通常爸爸進城總是太陽剛出來的時候，歸家在日落之前，他辦貨，選租每年進城好幾回，但從沒有見過城里的夜景——城里有汽油燈，電燈，元宵的燈會更是每年一度的盛况。</p>
<p>爸爸讓小姐姐騎在他肩頭上，在那樣如潮湧的人羣中擠出擠進，看各家的燈彩。燈彩要算大盛綢緞局的最精彩，門前的人牆幾乎國到對街，爸爸擠在人牆里看得拉開了嘴，小姐姐更是划着手脚，她要爸爸擠到最前　去，她想打一下那個白鬚的老道。那老道用棉花裝着白鬚白髮，手里執若雲帚，站在山頂上，他手里的雲帚那樣有規則地拂動着，像有人在後向牽綫似的。另一面有一個小旦，執着雙刀，也是向空舞動着，身旁一長列蝦兵蟹將，提着各式兵器，向老道對仗那樣。那燈彩叫水漫金山，是白蛇傳的故事。據說利用電氣紮燈彩是大盛綢緞局第一家發明。</p>
<p>小姐看過燈會回家，姑姑送了她一盞兎子燈。她從此不學母親做衣服了，不論白天晚上，點着燈燭，在塲田里亂跑，幾乎把那些野孩子看紅了眼睛。沒有幾天兎子燈被火星焚毀了，她哭着要爸爸只一個。爸爸說現在沒有燈賣了，明年燈會到城里　買。小姐姐就天天　　年，她知道　過年到月半沒看盡天了。</p>
<p>第二年的元宵，城裏雖然照舊出燈會，大盛綢緞局門前的水漫金山依舊被圍上了十幾層人牆，但是小姐姐沒有到城里去！姑姑家已在年底搬回鄕下了，說城里沒有生意，開銷又大，帶回來有一盞破舊的鯉魚燈送了小姐姐。爸爸終天皺着盾，大年初一祭天，也是沒精打彩地，小姐姐應該又大一歲了，爸爸却沒有注意到。小姐姐曾偷偷問媽，月半會不會進城看燈會，媽沒有回答。小姐姐撩着破鯉魚燈玩了一陣子。</p>
<p>今年小姐姐七歲了，大年初一她乖乖地瞧着爸爸的臉，爸爸的　像下雨天一樣陰沉，沒有一絲笑容。媽催促了好幾次，他才拋了旱烟袋上香祭天。頭祗叩了二個，小姐姐在半邊數着的，往時爸爸要叩上十個的。姑姑來和媽談談天兩個人哭起來了：爸爸獨自在房里喝酒，小姐瞧瞧着掛在牆角落里的破鯉魚燈壳子，默默地退到小凳上玩着她的破布零條，雖然她心里計算着過十四天又是月半了——城里出燈會的日子。</p>
<h3>石公秋月</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>石公山是洞庭八景之一，那兒有名勝，有古蹟，有……但是我自己雖然是生長在那里的，可惜在十三四歲就離開了那可愛的故鄉，一個人飄流到了這人地生疎的都市里來，己經十多個年頭，而終於不曾回去看看那曾經消磨過一個萬年的石公由，那離得我遼遠的童年殘夢，也祇在我的記憶里遺留下了那模糊的影子了。</p>
<p>「家鄉無恙乎？」現在自己在夢魂中也不能忘懷那別來十年的故鄕；所以愈是不能回去，要想回去的心愈切。於是那追憶和懷念也就日漸地在我心上積厚起來。然而十來年的飄泊流浪生涯，將我的肢體也磨礪得更怯弱了。因此今年向公司里請了三個月的長假，回到了鄉村里去歇夏；但是十年不見的故鄕畢竟是和以前有些不同了；屋後那片松林，如今已變了荒山，那前村從前曾經喧嚇一時的紳董椿二爺，他的孫子聽說巳在做偷兒度日；情形變遷得竟使我有些不大相信，這樣短短的十年，而恍如隔了一批，雖則十年前的一切我還很淸楚的記得，然而，然而我今日所看到的却不是　年前的故鄉！</p>
<p>在故鄉民經住了兩個多月了；一個頗悠長的夏天就這樣輕輕地送了過去，現在又是秋天了，「秋風秋雨愁煞人，」秋天是一個多麼感人的季候呵！</p>
<p>這一次我往在石公來是，完全想轉換一個環境，來調養我那給生活磨折壞了的身子，因此我和湄就在「淸照樓上住了下來，「湖照樓」是在「節烈祠」傍，太湖之濱建築的一座小樓，裏面明窗凈几十分雅潔籌稍右就是「覽景軒」及「御碑亭，」臨湖灘有「歸雲洞」石波螺」谷一，灘下還　有一個「水迥洞，」水大時洞被水漫沒，要是水淺時洞中有石棋桌，可在里面　棋的。左邊便是「一綫天」和「雲梯，」背後山麓中是「石公寺」，「來鶴亭，迎月齊」「翠屏軒」等，那兒風景的幽麗，實有出塵不俗之慨？有巖壑壁立的千丈懸崖，有蒼翠葱龍的蒼松叢林。那裏趕晨可以觀日出和賞晨霧，月夜則宜於步月，聽濤，雨天則更好欣賞雨中的「獎釐山」景，有風的時候却能够靜坐樓頭，聽那松濤和太湖裏浪花激着岸頭，互相交奏出的，雄壯的「大自然之歌。」</p>
<p>不過，在這裏却聽不到鷄嗚和犬吠的聲音，週遭是那麼靜悄悄地，像是一個「無聲區。」</p>
<p>是一個天氣淸朗的傍晚，我和湄倆走出了「湖照樓」，從「一綫天」穿過去，站在一堵懸崖上——我感到這彷彿就是「捨身巖」；舉目四眺，只見一望無際的太湖中羣山隱約地在這悠悠的烟波里伏着，蒼茫的暮靄却籠罩往了週遭，俯視崖下，却急流澎湃，怒潮洶湧地在灘傍激盪着：我這時像置身在夢的境界中，祇覺得自已是這樣的渺小了。</p>
<p>我就這樣地仰臥在軟草茵上，望着白雲在蔚藍色的天外迂緩地飛行，看那疎星閃耀出神，湄却坐在我身傍指手劃脚的談說；至於她說的什麼我全沒理會，只默默地不作一聲……</p>
<p>四野里是這樣的寂靜，從寺裏送來那幽幽的梵音，叩起了我的心弦，悵惘着人生，恐懼着現實，我不禁威到有些兒茫然了：</p>
<p>——月色是那可愛的，從此，我將乘着這月夜去找尋我永遠的歸宿！</p>
<p>夜深很，湖風吹冷了我的心懷，秋露浸濕了我的肌膚；去吧，歸去吧！還要留戀在這里幹什麼？</p>
<p>——月夜還是我童年一樣的幽美，靜穆；但時代是變了，社會已換了一個面目，就是我自己的環境也完全不同了。</p>
<p>默默地，我和湄走回了「湖照樓」。</p>

<p>例如最近有些地方住宅建築方面流行了西班牙式。起初那本為西班牙與墨西哥等民家所採用，其後便為喜歡倣傚異國溫美感覺得人所模倣。白的壁面影映着紅的西班牙瓦，窗小，使壁面具强硬角度，保持優美的曲綫及甘柔的陰影。這些固會釀成使人悠然神往於微妙的熱帶之夕照，頗能握住人們的嚮往之心。</p>
<p>然，此種甘柔的作品，若別處加以倣傚，則有些不像樣。原來在那種式樣發源地的地中海和近熱帶的美洲地方，是照射着强烈的日光，當然需要小窗，以防阻直射日光的射入。從而建築外部的外觀，因窗小，壁面形成强硬角度。但這麼一來，便遮斷風的流通，使室內感到悶熱。因此在熱地家屋的內部，須設備中庭。向中庭開放各室，凉風纔能自由流通於室內。然，在暑季濕氣高的地方，家星幾必須全部開放。若徒傚別人外觀，使建築全體，成為窗小密閉的東西，那簡直是愚不可及了。</p>
<p>總之，窗的考究，須求明亮的日光射入及健康的紫外綫照射，以謀達到開放的目的。對注意調換新鮮空氣，流通凉風的純工學的窗門，我們是會感到新鮮刺戟的美。現代建築家們已深深感到後者的健康美；而美學家們反愛着前者。於此，我們祗好說那不過是病　的觀感。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>我們與其用無意義的外觀釀成傷感的情懷，不如於不帶一點技巧中感到莊嚴的美。</p>
<p>一根鐵柱，靠力學的計　，其被設計的材料學的純粹，是何等密緻。較之打扮的虛飾，實健美得多。於此，跟着「適用」的迫切，便悠然會感到强力的高揚美。</p>
<p>在這樣的意義中，現代建築，比諸靠過去建築家意匠結晶的宮殿與寺院，則工廠更會感到新時代的美。蓋後者是以所謂生產的機能為第一要件，排除一切不經濟的建築。現代建築美，是建立在新材料與構造的活躍上。這可用那被稱為破壞藝術，使人類感情化石化的純實用建築的工廠以為實例。活用原料，而亦注意工藝方面，建築的進行，甚且起重機與橋梁均被應用。</p>
<p>由是，至今被認為非藝術典型的工廠，已大量建築，成為保有輝耀的新意義美的作品。組合標準化的材料，作成一律的長屋建築式。於是具有新型美的東西，便表現於世。所謂「乾式構造」的構製法，是在建築地基上組立結合工廠造就的建築材料，迅速從事建築工程。卽是在工作塲所甚且不需要使用水，祗要把已製好的各種建築材料接合便得了。因建築材料旣是工廠生產的改良品，不會缺乏什麼，亦不會為天氣所左右，實現了極經濟的完成。</p>
<p>誠然，這樣機械化的製造品，是完全弗視以前尊重藝術的自由奔放的精神，阻碍努力於製作的藝術家精進之途。然而，此種建築，却完成雄壯。卽是說，在現代，建築已非個人的藝術，而進至公認其為社會的生產物。將以前個性的色彩，一筆抹然。</p>
<p>今若有間判別建築美醜的尺度究否存在的，則可答之曰那是基準於其如何解决現代生活的要求及怎樣與現代生活發生密切的關係。（完）</p>
<h3>歐美提倡建築事業</h3>
<p>— 申生</p>
<p>波蘭創辦私有小住宅借欵　利息三釐半木料價格减低</p>
<p>歐美各國竭力提倡建築事業。關於建築學理方面。亦日有改進。蓋建築事業與都市之發達成正比例。各國政府謀求都市之繁榮。咸設法獎勵私人建筑。各銀行辦有低利建築貸欵。使人民投資建築。益有保障。在歐洲方面。德法意諸國均採取此項獎勵建築事業政策。而新興之波蘭為尤甚。波蘭為金本位國家。年來未受世界貸幣風潮之影響。經濟基礎。日趨穩固。波蘭之建築借欵。始自一九二五年。由波蘭國家經濟銀行開始辦理。其目的在提倡建築自有住宅。凡欲建築者。均可向該行借欵。所取之利息極低。條件亦極優厚。自此項借欵開始放借後。凡地方當局。各機關。以及私人等。均有借貸。其後因政府所備之建築放欵。日見减少。遂改變放借辦法。此後之放欵。將注重於私人小住宅之建築。為便利此項計劃進行起見。為獎勵私人投資於小地產起見。政府更竭力設法使造價直接减低。關於建築材料之價格。政府强迫减低。運輸費亦竭力减低。關於國營公司之木料。更能欠賬。總之政府極力剗除一切有碍發展建築事業之阻碍物。上外凡間接足以增加建築物之造價者。如材料之納稅。管理費打樣費登記費等亦力求减少。例如自一九三三年六月一日起。政府自動將建築放欵之利息由六釐减至三釐。卽連又四分之三。或三釐半而已。一九三三年並有新法律頒行。免除新屋建築稅。更有一點足以有助於小住宅建築之發展者。卽外國幣制價値之减低。尤以美國金元價値之减低為最有利各小儲蓄戶。因幣制價値之减低。遂均投資於建築事業矣。在一九三三年中政府所放出之建築住宅借欵。達一四五〇〇〇〇〇波金。所築成之住宅。有二八八一九間房屋。共有八二〇〇層。造價之總額為六五〇〇〇〇〇〇波金。由此可見人民投資於小住宅之一般矣。在一九三四年中。政府所放出之建築借欵。增至三四五〇〇〇〇〇波金。其中有二三二〇〇〇〇〇波金。卽百分之六七又四。專為建築住宅之用者。此外九七〇〇〇〇〇波金。卽百分之二八又三。為建築大住宅之用者。在一九三四年中計築成小住宅四〇〇〇〇間。計一四二〇〇層。其造價之總頌為八五〇〇〇〇〇〇波金。在一九三二至一九三四年中。所築成之小住宅共有三五〇〇〇層。計有九〇〇〇〇間。其中私人投資者。計占百分之二四。在一九三五年預算案中。所規定之三六〇〇〇〇〇〇波金建築借欵中。政府均决定將一八六〇〇〇〇〇波金。專作貸與建築小住宅之用。是以在本年中關於小住宅之建築。將有更滿意之結果也。為求改良建築物之質料起見。波蘭國家經濟銀行除負責經濟指導外。更竭力使建築物格外鞏固。是以銀行代小主戶計劃招標結果。均能以最低之造價。得最堅固之房屋。除波蘭國家經濟銀行竭力指導小住戶之住宅建築外。波恊會中。亦設有建築房屋顧　處。終年為社會服務云</p>
<h3>中國古代建築之內部分析（中）</h3>
<p>— 穉雲</p>
<p>（二）墙壁——重要的建築物，墻壁大都用石。普通的房屋，都用磚頭和木料做材料。大部份中國木造房屋，木柱都立在石基或磚基之上，以防潮濕與腐爛，磚有的時候，也有面為有光有色的，墻壁遂亦有時用琉璃瓦的。墻壁看看很厚，大都中間空的，一則因為要節省材料，二則，能使房屋有適合的氣候。墻，也有「單」「夾」的分別：還有一種名叫風火墻，是砌在兩面廂房的南端的屋頂上，大槪高出屋頂五六尺，與墻門相並立。它的用處，一則是預防隔壁人家火燒，火舌延過來。二則還可避烈風的襲擊。</p>
<p>（三）門窗——門的形式，不論是大門，邊門，都作長方形。但自平行之木材下，雕刻着各種細紋的花牙，其外形遂成種種狀態。牌樓為中國特別的走門。有時用於廟宇及墳墓之門；有時用以為紀念先賢之物；有時則立於街頭。其結構，原本用木料，有兩個或兩個以上的立柱。平橫着有嵌木。作一個二個或三個走門。有時建有許多花架，猶如廟殿之簷下所用者。</p>
<p>窗的形式也是作方長形，在方架中又橫豎的架着許多木條，把一扇窗分許許多多的小方格，每一小方格上，鑲入貝殼薄層，俗名叫「黎殼」，是一種可以透光的滑石質，太陽光放進來的光，經過這層殼，是很柔和而光亮的。在內地的鄕下的窗戶上，因近年水旱荒交迫，雖則這種「黎殼」是極便宜的，但也無力用了，祇好用紙頭來代替。</p>
<p>（四）屋頂——房屋的頂，是為一所房屋的主要物，中國的屋頂與希臘，羅馬文藝復興時代的風格完全相反。在希臘式的各種式子中，都要想把屋頂藏掉的。而中國的屋頂及屋脊，則用種種方法，使他能顯　堂皇，尤其是屋脊的裝飾，貴戝不等。</p>
<p>在從前的專制時代，的確裝一條屋脊是不容易的。屋脊二頭的二隻所謂「孵鷄扇頭」；孵雞扇頭的形式，似二隻雞孵在屋脊的二端在這二隻孵雞扇頭　，分出人家的貴賤。普通能裝這二隻東西，一定要捐過一個「監生」，不然要替你拆掉的。還有一種叫「坐盤孵雞」，是在雞的下面把一塊綱磚；這樣的人家，一定要有前淸時代的一個「舉人」身份，方始可以造。普通屋頂上面蓋的瓦，是從下面一張張的疊上去，一條瓦是朝天放的，一條是向下放的，看起來很莊嚴，而且這種一張張的空疊着，可以調節室內的過冷，和過熱。屋的正中一根叫「正樑」兩端用木柱支着，和附立的牆無關。頂有一部是下陷的。普通都用掛軸的S形瓦以灰黏之，有時也用之以為連接之用，以防為風所掀。有人以為這種空的曲彎的頂，乃出源於原始時代的「幕」。有人以為是用竹的結果，受重壓的緣故，以致灣曲。但這是一種設計，用以避免曝光的直接射入，保護不堅　的牆壁；使雨水不能積留於屋頂。屋頂之架，乃係用長方形的「金中架」。用木頭接荀的方法，連竹子在一起。如此房頂的重量，是垂直的，而不是傾斜及於牆壁。</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Judicial Conference Opens; Dai and Ye Represent the Central Government to Give Instructions; Ju Zheng Chairs and Delivers the Opening Address; All Personnel Visit the Mausoleum After the Meeting; First General Assembly Held in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Judicial Conference opened at 9:00 AM on the 16th in the Mingzhi Building of the Examination Yuan. Central representatives Dai Chuanxian and National Government representative Ye Chucang, Presidium members Ju Zheng, Qin Zhen, Wang Yongbin, Jiao Yitang, Mao Zuquan, Xie Guansheng, Hong Ludong, Xie Jian, and guests Shi Ying, Wang Shijie, Huang Musong, representatives from various institutions, and all members, totaling over 500 people, attended. Chairman Ju Zheng performed the ritual and delivered the opening address, first expressing his admiration for everyone's enthusiastic participation in the opening of the National Judicial Conference. He stated that convening such a conference since the establishment of the National Government was unprecedented, and all important issues concerning the judiciary would be discussed, which was of great significance. At the same time, the mission undertaken by the conference was also very important, and the results of the conference would certainly occupy an important page in the history of China's judiciary. He then stated that China's judicial system had taken shape so far, but the plan for improving the status quo should not be delayed. From his consideration, he believed that those who talk about the judiciary today should first understand the following four characteristics: (1) The judiciary should be progressive, not conservative; (2) The judiciary should be experimental, not idealistic; (3) The judiciary should be universal, not local; (4) The judiciary should be holistic, not individual. Finally, he mentioned the contributions of Vice President Qin, who was previously sent by the Central Government to inspect Europe and the United States, and former Vice Minister Shi Ziquan, who inspected the judiciary of Japan. Recently, Minister Wang Yongbin inspected the courts and prisons in North China. The original intention was to prepare for timely improvement with on-the-spot investigation data, but this matter is of great importance and still relies on collective efforts. Therefore, today's meeting was convened. Then, Central Representative Dai Chuanxian gave instructions, briefly stating that China is the oldest civilized country in the world, and the perfection of its legal system dates back 4,000 years. With the import of modern European and American legal systems, scholars have almost forgotten the merits of our country's rites and laws and lost the meaning of moral education. The judicial system has been established for nearly 30 years, but its quality and quantity have failed to reach a perfect state. Since the capital was established in Nanjing and the Five Yuan were established, the progress of the judicial system has also developed in the same direction as the other four powers. Over the past few years, domestic and foreign troubles have invaded each other, but our responsibility for national construction has never been relaxed. Now, President Ju and his colleagues have convened this conference to seek improvement in the judiciary, uniting national legal officials, legal experts, and administrative judicial leaders, in order to achieve the success of the revolution and the great goal of solidifying the national destiny. This will ensure that our country's foundation is solid, social order is civilized, and the lives and livelihoods of the people are truly guaranteed. This great effort is not only what our Chinese comrades are doing their best to promote, but also the hope of the people of the whole country, and the focus of attention of countries all over the world. He respectfully wished the National Judicial Conference all achievements and all members good health and hard work. After Dai's speech, National Government Representative Ye Chucang gave instructions, briefly stating that today he was ordered by the Chairman of the National Government to attend the meeting and give a speech. The General Program of National Construction stipulated the establishment of the Five Yuan, and since the establishment of the Judicial Yuan, various systems and scales have been gradually established. Central judicial organs, such as the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee, have been established in sequence, and all legal codes and regulations have been gradually implemented through efforts. At the same time, the increase in courts in various provinces and the improvement of prisons are constantly progressing. In this improvement, the convening of this National Judicial Conference is a major milestone in China's judicial system. China has a large territory and population, and its economy is gradually becoming difficult. All of these are related to the judiciary. In the midst of difficulties, it is now possible to hold this important meeting, which is actually a guide to the future progress of China's judiciary. The National Government has infinite hopes for this conference. He respectfully wished everyone success and health on behalf of Chairman Lin. Next were speeches by expert Jiang Yong and judicial consultant from Italy, Lai Banya, whose words were extremely enthusiastic and hopeful. At 10:30, the presidium led all members to visit the mausoleum outside Zhongshan Gate, first playing music, then Chairman Ju led the ceremony and offered wreaths on behalf of everyone. They then entered the mausoleum in an orderly manner to pay their respects to the remains of the Premier. The ceremony was completed at 11:30, and a photograph was taken. All returned to the Examination Yuan to attend the luncheon held by the presidium in the Mingzhi Building. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Judicial Conference held its first general meeting at 2:00 PM on the 16th, with 164 people attending and 42 people in attendance. The chairman was Ju Zheng. The members of each group were designated as follows: Group 1: Pan Enpei, Xie Yingzhou, etc., 41 people; Group 2: Zhang Zhiben, Xia Quan, etc., 48 people; Group 3: Zheng Lie, Chen Fumin, etc., 40 people; Group 4: Shi Ziquan, Hong Lanyou, etc., 43 people.

Subsequently, the chairman designated Xie Yingzhou from Guangdong, Zhu Chaosen from Guangxi, Hu Xianglin from Hebei, Wu Zhenzhuan from Shandong, Xie Shengtang from Sichuan, and Pan Huang from Guizhou, all presidents of higher courts, to successively report on the general situation of the judiciary in their respective provinces. Finally, Wang Yongbin reported on the judicial situation of his inspection of seven provinces in North China. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. At 6:00 PM, all representatives attended a banquet hosted by the Examination Yuan. At 8:00 PM, the four review committees held their first review meetings simultaneously, which adjourned at approximately 10:00 PM. The conference is scheduled to hold its first general meeting at 8:00 AM on the 17th to discuss 18 items. Review committees will meet at 2:00 PM and 8:00 PM in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Judicial Advisor Lai Banya's speech said, "Today is the first judicial conference convened after the establishment of the National Government, bringing together the highest judicial officials and famous scholars from all over the country. This is truly a grand event. As I am about to return to my country, I would like to contribute the principles of Fascist justice to all of you as a temporary message. The principles of Fascist justice can be summarized in Mussolini's three words: 1. Power, 2. Order, 3. Fairness. First, let's talk about the first point. Any country that wants to seek survival, especially a country that is declining and trying to revive, cannot talk about so-called democratic politics or anarchism without power. Theoretical observation may have considerable value, but practice will inevitably cause disputes, especially in declining countries, which will have no way to escape difficult situations. Countries must make sacrifices and struggle to survive, but if there is no power mechanism at the top, the struggle will be ineffective. The second is order, which means that everyone keeps to their duties. When a country has a powerful organization, it can then make society disciplined and maintain order. This is law. The so-called economy is only a material aspect, but the spiritual aspect is more important than the material aspect. If the material aspects, such as the economy, are inferior to others, as long as everyone abides by discipline, trusts the government, and works hard, they can turn weakness into strength and poverty into wealth. This is the only requirement that the people should abide by. The third point is fairness, which is what everyone in the country should get, but note that this is in comparison with others, not absolute. Political and economic regulations are dead. The enforcers should find ways to use them in their hearts and strive for fairness. In this way, even if the law has shortcomings, it does not matter. In short, Fascist law is for a strong and responsible country to extend discipline from power, order each person to do their duty, and seek true fairness. I hope that China, including the whole world, can have final and permanent fairness, and I wish China and my ancestral country Italy a permanent and immortal position in the world." (Special telegram from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lai Banya, the Italian advisor to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, was hired by our government as a legal advisor to the ministry in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], with a contract originally set for two years, which will expire at the end of September this year. Because Lai has been away from his country for a long time and urgently needs to return to his country to serve, he is scheduled to leave Beijing for Shanghai on September 30, and then take a ship across the ocean to return to Italy in early October. (Special telegram from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ju Zheng said that the National Judicial Conference has already opened, and there are many proposals from various parties. The meeting was originally scheduled for five days and will close on the afternoon of the 20th. Now, it is feared that the review will take time. If there is not enough time, it will be extended by one day. At the closing ceremony, the conference intends to issue a declaration and will push representatives to draft it for approval at the next general meeting before it is issued.

<h3>Land Administration Conference Closes; Resolutions on Land Use, Expropriation, and Other Cases</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Land Administration Conference held its third general meeting on the morning of the 16th. Chairman Tao Lüqian reported on the review process of each proposal and resolved the following major cases: (A) Land Use: (1) The implementation procedures for land administration shall be detailed and implemented by the Ministry of the Interior, which will present them to the Executive Yuan and convene relevant agencies; (2) Amending the Land Law, the state shall provide more protection and incentives for immigrants to develop the border areas in order to consolidate national defense. The general assembly approved the principle, and the Ministry of the Interior convened relevant agencies to discuss the measures. The amendment of the Land Law will be discussed in another case; (B) (1) Land Expropriation: Regarding land expropriation for railways and national roads, convenience should be provided when necessary; (2) Land expropriation administration shall be included in the general outline of the land administration implementation procedures of each province and city; (C) (1) Due to local circumstances, the standard Land Law in Suiyuan shall be postponed; (2) Reform of Chinese cemeteries; (D) Land Registration: (1) Land surveying shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures for large and small triangulation surveys. Before the large triangulation is carried out, each province and city shall submit an application for prior small triangulation, and the provincial capital and bustling commercial ports shall be implemented first. Those that have not been carried out shall submit a plan for implementation within six months; (2) The Ministry of the Interior shall formulate measures for aerial surveying in conjunction with the General Staff Headquarters; (3) The surveying of land in Chahar Province shall be postponed; (4) It was decided that the large triangulation survey will be implemented in the next fiscal year; (5) The Ministry of the Interior shall determine the deadline for land consolidation in each province; (6) Each province and city that has established land administration agencies shall establish a geological survey institute; (7) Formulate regulations for the investigation of public land; (E) Land Registration: (1) Penalties for late registration shall be drafted by each province and city and submitted to the Ministry of the Interior for approval; (2) The formats of books, forms, and tables used in land registration shall be determined by the Ministry of the Interior. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The chairman gave a closing speech, briefly stating that the conference had received a total of 65 proposals, of which 35 were resolved, all of which were programs that urgently needed to be implemented in the current land administration. Furthermore, 65 people attended, all of whom were able to concentrate and discuss carefully, which shows their attention to the conference. This spirit of advancing the Land Law and practical experience has enabled each issue to be resolved. However, meetings usually resolve without acting, and the resolutions are not implemented. It is hoped that the resolutions of this meeting will avoid repeating the same mistakes and can be implemented one by one. At the closing ceremony, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the ministry and wish everyone good health. Finally, member Zhu Ping delivered a reply, briefly stating that this conference has given us the opportunity to contribute our opinions to the central government, which we are extremely grateful for. We are especially impressed by the spirit of the central government in promoting the Land Law. Before the Land Law was implemented, there were many national difficulties. Although the Ministry of the Interior had previously promulgated the general outline of the procedures for land administration in each province and city, it felt that the power was small. Recently, representatives gathered to discuss and formulate the general outline for land administration, and the conference has yielded results. Colleagues should work hard to promote it and live up to the expectations of the central government. We also hope that the central government will soon submit the outline of the Land Law to the Executive Yuan for implementation. (Central News Agency telegram from the 16th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Held Weekly Memorial Service Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government and the National Government held a joint Premier Sun Yat-sen memorial week at the Central Auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 16th. Ye Chucang, Lin Sen, Cheng Tianfang, Li Zonghuang, Wang Qi, and Wei Huai, Chief of Staff of the National Government, Mao Zhongfang, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies, Chen Shaokuan, Chief of the Navy, and all colleagues of the Party Department, totaling approximately 600 people, attended. Chairman Ye Chucang led the ceremony. Cheng Tianfang gave a report, briefly stating that China formally joined international organizations during the late Qing Dynasty, and seemed to be a backward country in international groups. However, China already had diplomacy during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods and occupied a very important position in politics, such as Su Qin and Zhang Yi's alliance strategy, which is similar to the activities of today's European politicians and diplomats. After Qin unified China, because there was no other country that could stand against China, diplomacy became silent day by day, and now it has become a backward country in the world. As for the principles of international politics, as well as the propositions on international relations and foreign policy, our ancestors also had them, and they mostly advocated peace and opposed war. Political scholars in various countries around the world are thinking hard all day long, and our ancestors have already discussed them. However, if we want to make our ancestors' theories known to the world, we must first restore our nation and make it on par with other countries in the world. Any country must use its sensitive diplomatic skills and enrich its national strength to turn from weak to strong and from decline to prosperity. However, national strength does not rely solely on military equipment. Scientific strength, female strength, and economic strength are also essential. For example, after the Great War, Germany's environment was extremely difficult. The reason why it was able to revive in a short period of time was because its government and people were able to bury themselves in hard work and make amazing developments in science, industry, and economy. Our country is also in a difficult situation now. We should learn from the spirit of the German government and people and strive to restore science, industry, and economy, which will definitely improve our international status and enable us to provide the theories of our ancestors to the world and promote them.

<h3>National Bank of Hong Kong Closes; Branches in Various Places Liquidate Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The National Bank of Hong Kong closed on the morning of the 16th due to poor turnover. The provincial branches also closed at the same time. The bank's assets and liabilities are each over 4 million, which is just enough to offset each other. (Special telegram from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin branch of the National Bank of Hong Kong received a telegram from the Hong Kong head office on the morning of the 16th to suspend business and await liquidation. The bank has been established in Tianjin for more than ten years and has had a lot of business with Chinese people. The liquidation method will wait for instructions from the Hong Kong head office. (Special telegram from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangzhou branch of the National Commercial Savings Bank of Hong Kong did not open for business this morning. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou branch of the National Commercial Savings Bank of Hong Kong did not open its doors this morning. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The National Commercial Savings Bank of Hong Kong did not open its doors this morning. There was a notice posted outside the door stating that the bank was ordered by the board of directors to suspend business pending reorganization. It is currently impossible to contact the bank's management, but according to the opinions of major Chinese and foreign banks, the National Bank of Hong Kong has been in a difficult situation for some time, which is well known. Therefore, this morning's development was not unexpected. It is heard from reliable sources that the bank's exchange contracts with other banks have been completely offset. Therefore, the most affected are only depositors and shareholders. At the end of the week, the bank's directors tried to save the bank's affairs and hastily convened a board meeting, asking each person to contribute 50,000 yuan to overcome the difficulties, but the directors present politely declined. The bank's building is very magnificent, but it has been mortgaged for 400,000 yuan. It is heard that in the middle of last week, the president tried to add another 100,000 yuan to the mortgage but failed. The public opinion said that "suspending business pending reorganization" means complete liquidation. This morning, there were many Chinese depositors gathered outside the door. The authorities sent a large team of police to the scene to suppress them. Several women in the crowd cried loudly, and the scene was very sad. Among the depositors were fishermen, farmers, and servants, etc. These people were illiterate and did not believe that their savings would be sacrificed. Many asked passers-by to explain the notice posted outside the door again and again. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A director of the National Commercial Savings Bank of Hong Kong told a reporter that after the Guangdong Bank closed last week, the National Bank was greatly affected by cash withdrawals, and other banks in Hong Kong did not provide the assistance it expected. Therefore, it had no choice but to close its doors this morning. Today is the second extension period of the bank's ten-day payment of 20%. It is believed that the bank decided to suspend business because it was unable to continue to cope with depositors' withdrawals. It is heard that the board of directors held a meeting all night last night to try to find a solution, but no good plan was found. In the end, it was decided to suspend payment. It is heard that half of the bank's funds, that is, 800,000 Hong Kong dollars, had been withdrawn by the upper members in the previous period, and the remaining half was mostly bad assets and could not be realized. It is also heard that the debts total more than 4 million Hong Kong dollars. (Reuters dispatch from the 16th)</p>

<h3>Diplomatic War Between Geneva and Rome</h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The tense situation in East Africa is undergoing a diplomatic war between Geneva and Rome over the past few days. National stances are becoming increasingly clear. Now, all are quietly awaiting the specific proposals from the League of Nations' Committee of Five to determine subsequent actions. It is said that the Committee of Five's proposals will be presented to the parties concerned today. Whether the content will be accepted by Italy remains questionable. The League of Nations views this as the ultimate reconciliation. If it is still not resolved, it will inevitably invoke Article 15 of the Covenant, a step no different from how the League of Nations handled the Sino-Japanese issue four years ago.</p>
<p>The East African issue has transformed from a dispute between Italy and Abyssinia into a dispute between Britain and Italy. The point of contention has also transformed from a colonial issue into one concerning the solemnity of the League of Nations Covenant and international treaties, as well as the survival of the entire collective security system. This transformation has further increased the seriousness of the East African issue for the future of international relations. This is driven by British foreign policy. Looking at the diplomatic strategies of Britain and Italy in recent days, Italy seems to be retreating step by step. How different is it from Mussolini's initial assertion that Abyssinia should resolve the issue directly, without allowing third-party intervention? Although the Paris Tripartite Conference was fleeting, the Arbitration Committee has already issued its ruling. Rome hopes to reopen the Stresa Conference, but it has not been realized. The League of Nations Council appointed the Committee of Five, and although the Italian representative initially opposed it, he eventually had to agree to its establishment.</p>
<p>Italy's attempt to localize the Abyssinian issue has failed. Looking back at Britain, Foreign Secretary Hoare's high call was echoed by seventeen countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, South Africa, the Soviet Union, the Little Entente, and Portugal, all expressing their determination to uphold the Covenant. Even the United States, across the ocean, responded with the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>While all countries are united in calling for peace, it is too early to say that they are all united for further sanctions. French Foreign Minister Laval's speech to the League of Nations Assembly did not mention sanctions. After endorsing Secretary of State Hull's declaration to end the war, President Roosevelt immediately declared the neutrality policy of the United States. Even British Foreign Secretary Hoare said, "If we want to take responsibility for the Covenant, we should share it. The security of the majority of countries cannot rely solely on the efforts of a few powerful countries." It is questionable whether Britain is willing to independently shoulder the heavy responsibility of sanctions.</p>
<p>Now, let's make a brief and general review of the recent statements of Britain, France, and Italy. Britain and France are both democratic countries, and their foreign policies are based on the League of Nations. The foreign authorities of both countries are now making a common echo of adhering to the obligations of the Covenant at a time when the League of Nations is facing a serious test, hoping to give the League of Nations a new life and achieve the practical effect of saving the war from disaster. This was within our expectations. However, on the point of establishing a collective security system, there were differences in the priorities of the British and French opinions. Now, British Foreign Secretary Hoare has made an explicit expression on this. French Foreign Minister Laval called this day "a landmark date in the history of the League of Nations." Its significant impact can be known. In addition, the British Foreign Secretary made a proposal to redistribute world resources, which is also relevant to the future talks between Britain and Japan. As for the full text of the French Foreign Minister's speech, it can be described as a wonderful rhetoric of being all things to all people. Its role is still to temporarily assume the role of mediator. Mussolini is in a very isolated situation under this tight and loose diplomatic pressure. Although the rights granted by Britain and France are gradually expanding (such as the Paris Tripartite Conference, where Britain only allowed Italy to enjoy Abyssinia's economic privileges, but now there is a saying that political rights will also be granted), the Italian cabinet declaration still said, "Italy has made great efforts and sacrifices, and a compromise solution to the Abyssinian issue is not allowed," and expressed a tough attitude of preparing to withdraw from the League of Nations. It is said that its aim is only to put pressure on the drafting of proposals by the League of Nations' Committee of Five. However, Italy is now in a position where it is difficult to back down, and it may inevitably resort to military adventure. The Five-Power Special Committee has been drafting a report on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute for a week, and it is now nearing completion. It may be completed tonight or tomorrow morning. The report is divided into two parts: one discusses Italy's memorandum accusing Abyssinia of being unworthy of being a member of the League of Nations, and may also include Abyssinia's reply; the other is based on the recommendations of the Paris Tripartite Conference, formulating detailed proposals, which are generally the same as the Paris recommendations, but expanding some of them, and the issue of providing joint economic assistance to Abyssinia is also included. If neither party to the dispute accepts the report, the League of Nations Administrative Council must meet to decide whether to adopt it in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. If it is adopted, Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant will be invoked, and neither party may engage in war until three months after the arbitrators' ruling or the Administrative Council's report. If the report is accepted by Abyssinia within this period, and Italy suddenly declares war on Abyssinia, its behavior will violate the obligations under Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant and will be subject to sanctions by the League of Nations. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Paris Echo, the draft proposal for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute formulated by the Five-Power Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council grants Italy substantial benefits. Its contents are divided into six items: (1) The League of Nations recognizes Italy's need to expand its colonies. (2) The Abyssinian Emperor's previous permission to cede the Wogadan province to Italy will be taken as Italy's. (3) Italy is allowed to "invade peacefully" certain lands whose residents do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Abyssinian government. (4) The Abyssinian Emperor should relinquish jurisdiction over the lands previously conquered, whose indigenous residents were expelled by Abyssinia. (5) Fertile areas suitable for Italian immigrants to reside and cultivate should be allowed to be leased to Italy. (6) Italy and Abyssinia should conclude a new treaty of peace and friendship, which should be supplemented by an agreement between Britain, France, and Italy. This agreement should be approved by the Abyssinian Emperor, and the areas under the jurisdiction of Britain, France, and Italy in East Africa should be clearly demarcated. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Secret Negotiations Among Countries - Views on Sanctions Against Italy - Unanimous Advocacy of Economic Measures - Military Movements of Britain and Italy</h3>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, negotiations are currently underway in secret among the delegations of various countries that have decided to support the League of Nations regarding the implementation of sanctions against Italy. It is said that the delegations of various countries unanimously advocate taking purely economic sanctions and intend to lift the ban on the export of arms to Abyssinia if necessary, while imposing an embargo on arms to Italy. However, some difficulties inevitably arise each time the issue of prohibiting ships from entering and leaving rivers and seas from loading military supplies is considered, because warships of countries supporting the League of Nations in rivers and seas will also be unable to obtain military supplies. It is also said that Central Asia believes that banning trade with Italy is sufficient to put financial pressure on Italy, and its effect can prevent the war from spreading elsewhere. However, more than ten other countries believe that banning trade with Italy is detrimental to the interests of each country, so they advocate focusing on banning the export of military supplies, while also prohibiting the sale of coal and steel to Italy, which is sufficient. Britain believes that banning the purchase of Italian goods is more effective. If an embargo on arms, coal, and iron is implemented, it may not be effective unless a blockade against Italy is implemented. However, implementing a blockade on the Italian coast is more likely to cause serious incidents than blockading the Red Sea, which is also recognized by Britain. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, the authorities on the British island of Malta in the Mediterranean issued three orders yesterday: (1) Anyone who spreads rumors that are sufficient to disturb people's hearts will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one month and a fine of up to £20. (2) If local newspapers publish remarks that are sufficient to disturb public order, the Governor may order them to cease publication without warning and impose imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of up to £100 on the person in charge of the newspaper. (3) The Governor may order the prohibition of the import of newspapers and publications from various places that are deemed unsuitable for distribution within the territory. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Milan According to local newspapers, the British navy stationed in the port of Alexandria has two ironclad cruisers, three ordinary cruisers, seventeen torpedo boats, one repair ship, one hospital ship, and two aircraft carriers. It is also said that British naval commander Forbes has reached an understanding with Egyptian Prime Minister Nessim Pasha to take precautionary measures to prevent the outbreak of war. The newspaper also said that the Egyptian government has instructed people living in Abyssinia to evacuate quickly, and that several squadrons of British aircraft will soon arrive in the Egyptian ports of Sudan and Soren. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Paris Echo's correspondent in London, the British Admiralty is extremely concerned about the situation, as can be seen from the increasing concentration of the British navy in the Mediterranean. The main purpose of the British naval concentration is clearly to protect Egypt. There are now more than 80 warships anchored in the Bay of Alexandria in Egypt, including several hospital ships. In addition, aircraft patrol the skies over Abu Qir, Port Said, and the Suez Canal day and night, and several cruisers provide protection. More than ten warships are concentrated in Port Sudan, and 30 fighter planes have flown to Sudan and will be responsible for air defense there. The leader of the Egyptian air force is now in London, consulting with the Ministry of War and negotiating the purchase of new aircraft for air defense. This is in terms of Egypt and Sudan. In addition, another purpose of the British Admiralty is to protect Palestine, which is administered by Britain. Several warships have been anchored in Haifa. Haifa is the starting point of the Mosul oil pipeline and is an important military location. As for the British island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean, it will be used to protect the naval reserve fleet. It is expected that many British warships will be concentrated there. If war breaks out, and the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar are blockaded, Britain will no longer be able to use the Mediterranean as a major trade route. There are many difficulties for Britain, which is also recognized by the British Admiralty. So far, the only method considered by the British authorities is to reroute trade with India and the Far East through the Atlantic Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope, and to the Indian Ocean.

<p>(London) The Italian government has recently increased its defenses in Italian Libya in Africa. The Times and Daily Telegraph have recently commented on this. According to the Times' correspondent in Cairo, although the Egyptian people are unanimously sympathetic to Abyssinia, the local newspapers, especially the Wafd Party newspapers, advocate that if Egypt is to participate in sanctions when sanctions are imposed on Italy, it must be conditional on Egypt gaining complete independence. As for the Italian people residing in Egypt, their number is about 50,000, and they are deeply concerned about their status after the sanctions are imposed, so they have begun to sell their properties. According to the Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Cairo, the total number of Italian troops stationed on the border between Egypt and Italian Libya is about 80,000. At the same time, the Italian army is installing three rows of caltrop barbed wire along 150 miles of the Libyan coast for defense. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Athens The Italian embassy recently submitted a request to the government to allow the fleet currently anchored in Greek ports to purchase food. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The development of the situation in Geneva and Rome at the end of the week makes people believe that the League of Nations will reach a critical juncture of survival after the League of Nations Administrative Council meets on Wednesday to listen to the report of the Five-Power Committee. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has so far refused all compromise solutions, so although the committee has worked hard to draft peace proposals, it is actually not confident about the future. Some parties predict that the committee may propose twelve proposals to solicit the opinions of Italy and Abyssinia, and how much can be accepted and how much can be conceded in order to avoid war. After the reopening of the League of Nations Administrative Council, it will approve this report and submit it to Italy. It is likely that Italy will reject it, and the difficulty of the Administrative Council will also arise. If Italy attacks Abyssinia, the League of Nations Assembly must consider sanctions, which will be more difficult. When all else fails, the League of Nations may have the following two strengths: (1) The British navy blockades traffic in the Mediterranean Sea. (2) International troops attack the Italian border in the Alps. As for whether international troops can go to Abyssinia, it is difficult to determine, because German leader Hitler has asked the League of Nations to protect the people of Memel from Lithuanian oppression. If the League of Nations only cares about the Italian issue, Germany may forcibly intervene in the Memel issue. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Britain and Egypt Reach Understanding - Egypt's Rights Not Violated in Wartime</h3>
<p>Rome According to reliable sources, the Egyptian government has obtained a written assurance from the British government regarding Egypt's status in the war. It is said that Britain has promised not to violate Egypt's rights and will not take any special plans in Egypt without first obtaining the consent of the Egyptian government. It is said that this assurance was given to the Egyptian government after a meeting between Egyptian Prime Minister Nessim and the British Acting Commissioner in Egypt. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Current Crisis - Worth Exchanging for Collective Security - South African President Thinks So</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Small countries continue to declare their support for the League of Nations Covenant. Today, South African President Le Roux spoke at the League of Nations Assembly, announcing South Africa's adherence to its obligations and briefly describing international sentiment, saying that the League of Nations is full of gloom and sadness today, which is very different from the noble purposes it once had. Those whom we wanted to be friends with are now enemies, and those whom we admired are now against us. There is almost nothing more painful than this. This is the price we will pay for collective security, but it is worth it. If an aggressor is allowed to act freely, and other countries stand by and watch, it would be better to restore the previous alliance system. Is the League of Nations worth surviving, or should it be allowed to collapse? This will be decided by our own actions. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Poland Criticizes Soviet Russia - Dissatisfied with Litvinov's Words</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting at 10:30 this morning. First, it voted on the re-election qualification of Poland, a semi-permanent member of the Administrative Council. As a result, 45 out of a total of 53 votes were in favor, so Poland will definitely be elected for re-election when the Assembly holds elections this afternoon.</p>
<p>After the voting ended, Irish Free State President de Valera stood up and said that collective security is a necessary condition for maintaining peace. The Irish Free State will execute the Covenant in accordance with the letter and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and requested that a peace conference be convened immediately to resolve the current dispute. Then, Panamanian representative Solís stood up and gave a speech, saying that if strong countries are allowed to disregard international constraints, the fate of the League of Nations will be in danger. Therefore, it is necessary to execute the Covenant and organize collective security.</p>
<p>Next, Polish representative, i.e., Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, spoke and protested against the speech made by Soviet representative Litvinov on the 14th. He said that Mr. Litvinov attacked the act of concluding "bilateral agreements" with certain countries, saying that this method contains aggressive intentions and is an arbitrary criticism of a certain diplomatic step of the Polish government. I must reserve my opinion on this action. This view, in the eyes of the Polish government, is not worth mentioning, but since Poland joined the League of Nations as a member state, I am surprised by this extraordinary action in the capacity of a representative of such an old member state, believing that international sincere cooperation can be shaken, and this sincere cooperation is a necessary condition for the League of Nations to carry out its work.</p>
<p>Then, Haitian representative Nemours declared that the solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute should be based on the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant. At this time, it was noon, and the Assembly declared that the general debate had ended. Austrian representative Baron Pflügl suddenly stood up and spoke, saying that Austria advocated that all member states should be able to be elected as members of the Administrative Council in fact, so the general public believed that the country would definitely submit its candidacy in the near future. After Pflügl finished his speech, the Assembly declared a recess, and the time was 12:15, and it was scheduled to continue at 3:30 in the afternoon. The agenda of the afternoon meeting included the election of three non-permanent and semi-permanent members of the Administrative Council. In addition, the Lithuanian representative seemed to comment on the speech made by German leader Hitler in the Lithuanian Parliament yesterday, because Hitler criticized the current situation in Memel.

<p>Italy Another Cabinet Meeting Tomorrow - Soldiers and the Public's Faith in Mussolini Remains Strong</p>
<p>(Rome) According to the official announcement today, the Italian cabinet will hold another meeting on Wednesday to discuss the development of the situation. Although the general public believes that the East African war is inevitable, Europe will not be involved in the vortex. Although the Fascist Party members are uneasy about the strong expressions of the League of Nations, their faith in Mussolini remains strong. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia - Mobilization Still in Progress - People's Hearts Are Increasingly Panicked</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa With less than two weeks left before the end of the rainy season, people's hearts are becoming more and more panicked, especially the foreign business community. They fear that the Italian army will directly attack the capital with aircraft at the beginning of the war. The authorities are currently engaged in preparations to protect the people. Many foreigners and locals are building bomb shelters in their gardens. British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval's speeches in Geneva were welcomed by the government and the public in Abyssinia, but everyone feels that the period of empty talk and negotiations is coming to an end, and it is now necessary to do everything possible to prepare to cope with the inevitable war. The Abyssinian Emperor does not want to take actions that would hinder Britain and France, but it is said that the Abyssinian Emperor and his advisors will make important decisions next week. 2,500 soldiers from various tribes gathered in front of the palace this morning, expressing their willingness to serve the Abyssinian Emperor. Many government employees have joined the army, and their positions are replaced by women. Mobilization is still in progress. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The Abyssinian Emperor and the Minister of the Army today summoned the country's business community and camel caravan leaders. The business community leaders represented 3,000 merchants and said that they were willing to use all their property as a backing for the Abyssinian Emperor. The camel caravan leaders also made the same oath. The Abyssinian Emperor gave a brief instruction, expressing his gratitude for the merchants' patriotic enthusiasm, and said that even if there is only one person left in Abyssinia, he will resist to the end. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The order for national mobilization and declaration of martial law has now been drafted, pending the signature of the Abyssinian King. People here are worried that Italy will reject the recommendations of the Five-Member Committee and withdraw from the League of Nations. If this happens, the order will be announced immediately. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain Will Consider - Guaranteeing Peace in Central Europe - In Exchange for French Assistance on the East African Issue</h3>
<p>(London) According to today's Morning Post, the British cabinet is considering guaranteeing peace in Central Europe to France under certain conditions. This kind of guarantee has long been anticipated by diplomatic observers, because only in this way can France's assistance on the Italo-Abyssinian issue be exchanged. At the same time, Britain's actions to defend Egypt are also in progress. For this reason, three minesweepers have also sailed to the Strait of Gibraltar. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Mail, the cabinet may hold a meeting this week to study the possibility of Britain adopting a definitive constraint on maintaining peace in Central Europe. The so-called definitive constraint refers to Britain's promise to take necessary measures under certain circumstances. According to the newspaper's observation, "Although the British government was unwilling to make the obligations it bears of a general nature into a definitive written guarantee, it can now be believed that the government has seriously considered whether this is possible." In addition, the Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, also said that the cabinet will convene a meeting day and night to discuss the issue of convening Parliament earlier before Parliament resumes on October 29. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The News is deeply disturbed by France's position in Geneva and suspects whether Britain's attitude will be so resolute when disputes occur in other areas. It said that if this dispute occurred in Europe, it is unknown whether Britain would also uphold justice. Foreign Minister Hoare's speech did not express this. Britain is preparing to take strong measures in Abyssinia, but if an incident occurs in Austria, it is unknown what measures Britain will take. France used to have Italy as a friend, but now it is more isolated than before. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Hoare gave a speech at the League of Nations Assembly on September 11, advocating the redistribution of raw materials produced in various parts of the world, so that countries that have not obtained colonies can also share their benefits. The industrial community here believes that Hoare's proposal is just a fantasy, because if Hoare's proposal is to be implemented, there are only two methods: either countries lacking raw materials obtain important raw material benefits from colonial countries, in which case these countries must not have the ability to pay such huge sums of money; or rich countries automatically give up a part of their benefits, in which case there are two difficulties, because countries that give up raw materials, such as investing in purchasing from companies that control raw materials and then transferring them to other countries, will increase the burden on the government budget; on the contrary, if the country confiscates without investing in purchasing, the companies operating raw materials will inevitably declare bankruptcy. For example, if a quarter of the Katanga steel mine in the Belgian Congo is purchased, it will cost 100 million pounds. If poorer countries invest in paying for it, where will they get such huge amounts of foreign currency? As for Hoare's advocacy that richer countries should purchase more goods from poorer countries, this is also incompatible with the current disorganized economic trend. Since the Ottawa Imperial Conference, the export of Italian fruits and other goods to Britain has been greatly reduced, resulting in a decrease in Italy's foreign currency reserves, which is clear evidence.

<h3>Paris Newspapers Warn Mussolini; Opinions Differ on Italy's Withdrawal from the League</h3>
<p>French newspapers hold differing opinions regarding Italy's threat to withdraw from the League of Nations. While "Le Temps" acknowledges the gravity of the situation, it states that the communique has not closed all doors to peaceful hope, but merely aims to satisfy the Italian public's appetite. "Le Débat" shares the view of "Le Temps" and warns Mussolini that if he does not accept a solution that strengthens his prestige and meets the legitimate demands of the Italian people, he risks alienating his closest friends. Most other newspapers are pessimistic, stating that a break between Italy and the League of Nations is only a matter of time. (Reuter's dispatch, 16th)</p>

A draft of the convention, jointly prepared by Italy and France in Paris, has been circulated to relevant countries for review. It may be formally signed in the shortest possible time. "However, the Danube issue will not be raised for discussion until the League of Nations Council Committee submits its final recommendations on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute; in other words, not before Wednesday or Thursday of this week," it is said.

<h3>Soviet Union Prepares to Open Northern Sea Route Service from Murmansk to Vladivostok</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A telegram received here today from Dr. Schmidt, director of the "Great Northern Sea Route" currently in Igarka at the mouth of the Yenisei River, states that a regular freight and passenger service via the Northern Sea Route, from Murmansk through the Arctic Ocean to Vladivostok, will be opened in the spring.

The plane is expected to reach its destination in about ten days. The first trial flight is scheduled to begin on October 2nd, followed by six more trial flights. After receiving reports, the company will establish a regular air service, and then conduct a trial flight across the Atlantic, possibly flying eastward from London to New York.

<h3>Dutch Bank Raises Interest Rates</h3>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources here, the Dutch Bank's increase in interest rates today is another clear indication of the Colijn government's determination to maintain the gold standard. The guilder is currently weak, so this move was not unexpected. Before and after the announcement of the interest rate increase this morning, the exchange rate of the Dutch guilder against the British pound strengthened. At the same time, authorities stated that although a large amount of gold is planned to be shipped to the United States, this outflow will not significantly affect the Dutch Bank's gold reserves. According to law, the ratio of gold reserves to immediate liabilities must be at least 40%, but it is currently around 70%. (Reuter's dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Declares to the Reichstag His Unwavering Love of Peace; Military Build-up Aims to Protect Germany's Freedom; Does Not Wish to Interfere in Others' Affairs and Fall into Whirlpool; Never Forgets Memel and Remains Mortal Enemy of Communism</h3>
<p>Nuremberg The German Reichstag convened tonight in a meeting held in the local theater. The theater was painted brown with a large silver swastika at the base, dazzling. The roads near the theater were crowded with spectators. In addition to senior officials, journalists, and foreign representatives, many were in attendance. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg At 9:00 tonight, Chancellor Hitler delivered his long-awaited government declaration to the 669 members of the Reichstag, many foreign dignitaries, and other important guests. He began by stating that Nuremberg has deep roots in the National Socialist movement, and that it also has close ties to the laws that will be presented to the Reichstag. Therefore, it was chosen as the meeting place. Germany's national power, both internally and externally, has now recovered and strengthened, and the responsibility for handling national affairs is therefore heavier during this critical period. We have only one policy to follow, which is our unwavering love of peace. Such a statement is necessary today because, unfortunately, some international newspapers are still trying to drag Germany into a whirlpool. Some people are raising alarms, saying that Germany will attack France, while others say that Germany will attack Austria or Russia. However, I do not know what they are talking about. This kind of speculation makes those who advocate alliances and ententes vocal. Newspapers are also generous with their advice on Germany's friendships. In fact, any country that wants to be friends with Germany only needs to extend a hand, and Germany will gladly respond. The German government is determined to treat any country with this attitude, but it also stems from a sense of responsibility towards Germany itself. There seems to be no need to argue about this. Our aim is not to waste our hard-earned strength on foolish adventures. Germany's new military build-up is not intended to threaten the freedom of any country in Europe, but to protect Germany's freedom. We do not interfere in matters that do not concern Germany, nor do we want to be drawn into a whirlpool. Hitler then described the various events in Memel, saying that Memel was stolen during peacetime, and the League of Nations approved it on the condition that the autonomy of the Germans in Memel was respected. However, the Germans in that area have been subjected to illegal abuse for years. The protests of the responsible countries are only a formality and have no practical value or effect. Germany watches the development of this matter with a heavy heart. If the League of Nations could take precautions and turn its attention to Memel, make its autonomy match its name, and be respected by others, and prevent incidents that cause regret to all parties, we would be infinitely grateful. Germany's request to take effective measures to make Lithuania abide by its treaties is not excessive. We must admit that a country of 65 million people and a country of 2 million people should be respected equally. Regarding the activities of the Comintern, which is openly planning a world revolution, Hitler said that Germany will take strict measures to curb the spread of communism in Germany. We must recognize that these communists are almost all Jews. The incident of the Communist Party of New York insulting the German flag has been resolved after a statement from the US government. However, this incident best proves that Jews abuse their positions and spread their ideas, which should be corrected by our country's laws. Hitler added that there are now signs of Jews causing trouble in Germany, so the German government will seek a final solution to enable Germans and Jews to live in peace. If this hope turns out to be an illusion, then this entire issue will be re-examined. At this point, Hitler presented two new laws, hoping that the Reichstag would pass them. The first law stipulates the recognition of German nationality to obtain the national symbol of freedom, to implement a key point in the National Socialist Party's plan. The second law stipulates that the issues that the Reichstag cannot resolve will be handed over to the National Socialist Party for handling. The National Socialist Party and the entire nation stand behind this law. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<h3>Three New Laws Promulgated: Swastika Flag Adopted as National Flag; Regulations on German Citizenship; Marriage Between Germans and Jews Prohibited</h3>
<p>Nuremberg At today's Reichstag meeting, in addition to Chancellor Hitler's speech, three important laws were passed and promulgated: (1) The Law Regarding the National Flag, which adopts the red flag with a black swastika as the German national flag and merchant flag. The flags for the army and navy will be formulated separately by Chancellor Hitler. (2) The Law Abolishing Equal Rights for German People, which divides the German people into two classes: commoners and citizens. Only those who have proven their loyalty to the German state and hold a certificate of citizenship may be citizens. All others who are affiliated with German nationality but have not obtained citizenship are commoners. Commoners do not enjoy the same rights as citizens. (3) The Law Regarding the Status of German Jews, the first article of which prohibits marriage between Jews and Germans and races of similar descent. The remaining articles prohibit sexual relations between Jews and Germans. Violators will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years. If Jews and Germans intentionally evade the law and marry abroad, their marriage may be revoked and prosecuted. Furthermore, Jews may not employ German maids under the age of 45. In addition, Jews who display the German flag or wear the swastika emblem will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg The German Reichstag today passed the following laws: (1) German Flag Law, (2) German Citizenship Law, (3) Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor. The Flag Law stipulates that the German colors are black, white, and red, and the national flag and naval flag are both swastika flags. The Citizenship Law stipulates that only people of German or related descent may be German citizens. The rights of German citizens are proven by the issued citizenship certificate. The preamble to the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor states that the German Reichstag is deeply convinced that the purity of blood is the only condition for the eternal existence of the German nation, and is driven by the determination to maintain the German nation and make it last forever. Therefore, the following laws are unanimously passed: Marriage between Jews and Germans is prohibited. Illegal marriages or marriages performed abroad to avoid this law are void. Jews are prohibited from cohabiting with Germans without marriage. Jewish families may not employ German women under the age of 45 as servants. Jews may not display the German flag or use national colors, but may use Jewish colors. This right is protected by the government. The remainder of the law stipulates the penalties for destroying this law. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German public was shocked and horrified by the laws announced yesterday, as if struck by lightning. The move to change the swastika flag to the national flag was especially unexpected. However, foreign journalists had already anticipated it. Elderly people were deeply disturbed by the change of the national flag. Chancellor Hitler's statement that if the new laws cannot solve the Jewish question, it will be handed over to the National Socialist Party for resolution has also aroused all kinds of speculation. At the close of yesterday's meeting, the party anthem was sung before the national anthem, which was different from the previous procedure. This is also a noteworthy event. (Reuter's dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Semi-official criticism of the new racial laws passed by the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress is extremely supportive, stating that since the recent International Jewish Congress convened in Lucerne, Switzerland, publicly acknowledged that the Jewish question is not merely a matter of religious difference but a matter of racial difference, Jews have become a special unit. Therefore, Germany's current treatment of Jews as a minority within the country is based on the resolutions of the International Jewish Congress. The new law allows Jews to live a unique cultural life. Schools, theaters, sports groups, and other groups may not be mixed with Germans, and may not participate in issues that affect German national politics and the interests of Germans. This is the only way to regulate the relationship between Jews and Germans. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>Memel Elections to be Held According to Constitution; Lithuania Replies to Signatories of Convention; Deems Hitler's Remarks a Threat to Eastern European Peace</h3>
<p>(London) It has been learned here that Lithuania has replied to Britain, France, and Italy in satisfactory terms, stating that the Memel elections will be held in accordance with the 1924 Constitution. Memel, which covers an area of 1,099 square miles, was separated from Germany under the Treaty of Versailles and initially administered by the Conference of Ambassadors. In February 1923, it was ceded to Lithuania. According to the 1924 Constitution, Memel is a region under Lithuanian sovereignty but has extensive local autonomy. (Reuter's dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Kaunas Hitler's remarks attacking Lithuania at the Reichstag in Nuremberg yesterday are seen here as a threat of war against peace in Eastern Europe. The Lithuanian government plans to request that the countries that signed the Memel Convention warn Germany. The Lithuanian government also solemnly declares that the Memel elections will be held under the supervision of representatives of the great powers. (Reuter's dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>US Navy to Build Pacific Bases</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to senior naval officers, the United States has begun to build defenses and naval bases in the Pacific. The Navy views Japan's abrogation of the Washington and London Naval Treaties as a threat to US naval power in the Pacific. The Secretary of the Navy stated that the United States will soon designate certain areas as aviation reserves for the army and navy. Midway Island and Wake Island will likely follow the western end of the Aleutian Islands and be specially reserved by presidential order. Currently, the United States only has four "secret ports" in the Pacific: Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Guam, Kiska in Alaska, and Subic Bay in the Philippines. President Roosevelt's recent order to reserve the western end of the Aleutian Islands is not yet to use the area as a secret port, but only to prohibit commercial flights in the area. In light of developments, Midway Island and Wake Island will eventually become US naval bases. The two islands have now been developed as relay stations for the Pacific air route. If necessary, this commercial aviation can be prohibited. However, the United States cannot deploy defenses on the two islands until the Washington Naval Treaty expires at the end of 1936. Government authorities have indicated that even if a new treaty is signed in the future, the United States may reserve the right to lay naval works on the two islands and Guam. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles, USA Parks, chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, arrived here today for inspection and stated that when the next Congress convenes, it will proceed with the defense of the Pacific coast, ensuring that the 1,300-mile coastline is fortified with strong defense works, capable of repelling any powerful enemy. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<p>The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun published a special dispatch from New York, stating that the US naval authorities foresee the following changes in the balance of power among European naval nations due to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute: (1) The dominance of the British Navy in the Mediterranean will be greatly weakened as a result of Italian military actions, and therefore the British route to India will also be isolated due to the obstruction of the Italian Air Force, and the British Far East Fleet will be isolated. (2) To avoid disputes between Britain and Italy, the main force of the French Navy will return from the Mediterranean to the English Channel, and the main battleships and submarines currently under construction will also be concentrated in that area as soon as they are completed. This is a method of checking Germany, but on the other hand, it is inevitable that it will add a major threat to the British home fleet. (3) Germany will seize this opportunity to court Britain and France with the condition of restoring its old territories in Africa to seek its own benefit, and on the one hand, use diplomatic means to carry out its 35% major fleet plan against Britain. In this way, the naval disarmament conference this fall is feared to be hopeless due to the European naval arms race. However, as the initiator of the Washington Conference, the United States will have to take appropriate measures within the year to avoid competition without a treaty and will soon question the opinions of the British and Japanese governments. It is heard that if the US Navy Department does not receive a proper response from various countries, it will not hesitate to build a fleet without a treaty. However, the State Department is doing its best to prevent it due to budget concerns. Even if there is turmoil in Europe, the United States will strictly maintain its neutrality and support a unified domestic policy. Within the government, it is believed that even if there is a naval arms race in Europe, the Pacific will not be affected in any way. However, a security agreement should be established between the US and Japan, the two naval powers in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Peru Boycotts Japanese Goods; Japanese Merchants Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Osaka Since October 5 last year, Peru, a new market for Japanese cotton textiles, has notified Japan with a year's notice of the abolition of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. It has also announced since June 1 this year that it will implement an import distribution system for Japanese cotton textiles for the next six months. This has greatly shocked relevant merchants. The Japan Cotton Fabric South America Export Association and other three related groups are scheduled to convene a countermeasures conference on the 17th. The treaty between Japan and Peru is scheduled to expire on October 4 this year. However, the implementation of the import distribution system during the validity period of the treaty is a violation of the most-favored-nation treaty. In the first half of this year, Peru's imports of cotton from Japan increased significantly, and Japan has become a situation of over-import. Therefore, the general public believes that this measure taken by Peru this time is incomprehensible. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Education Promotes National Movement; Revitalizes National Spirit of Industry; Responds to Extraordinary Circumstances</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Education, in order to seek countermeasures, has formulated a national movement, which has recently been finalized and will soon be implemented. Its main points are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) In order to revitalize the national spirit, authorities in this field will be hired from six major cities to hold grand lecture meetings. (1) Distributing pamphlets to schools, youth groups, and others. (1) Initiated by the Ministry of Education and co-sponsored by the five ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior Affairs, Army, Navy, Agriculture, and Forestry, the Lectures on Countermeasures for the Current Situation will be held in Chiba, Nagano, Okayama, Kochi, Toyama, Shizuoka, Otsu, Nagasaki, Kagoshima, and other places.

<h3>Polish Senate Re-Elected Under New Election Law; Voting Very Apathetic</h3>
<p>Warsaw The Senate elections were held simultaneously in the capital and provincial cities today. The voting process was very apathetic, and the people paid little attention. The Senate elections were held under the new election method, whereby respected citizens elected representatives to vote. Therefore, only 260,000 people directly participated in the voting nationwide, less than 1% of the population. A total of 64 senators were elected this time, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of senators. Prominent government figures who were not elected in the parliamentary elections were all elected as senators, including Foreign Minister Beck, as well as two women. In addition, one-third of the senators will be appointed by the President by order on September 27. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Migrate Korean Farmers to Northeast; Colonization Company with Capital of 30 Million; 800,000 People to be Migrated in Next Ten Years</h3>
<p>Seoul The Korean Governor-General's Office plans to migrate 800,000 Korean farmers to Manchuria in the next ten years. The implementing agency, the Korean-Manchurian Colonization Company (capital of 30 million won), will be established next April and will merge with the East Asia Industrial Company, which specializes in immigration. The Korean Governor-General's Office recently decided that before the new company starts operating, the East Asia Industrial Company will implement an immigration plan of 1,200 households and 6,000 people in Yingkou, 300 households and 1,500 people in Suihua, and 200 households and 1,000 people in Sanyuanpu, and issue a subsidy of 370,000 won to purchase immigration land in the above-mentioned areas.

The funds were recently received and donated by various parties and overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese accounted for the largest portion of the donations. Overseas Chinese are concerned about the motherland and have actively donated. Their sincerity and righteous actions are commendable. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Shiying arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the evening of the 15th. On the morning of the 16th, reporters visited him and received the following information. Recently, domestic and foreign donations for disaster relief have reached 180,000 yuan. As the disaster areas are in urgent need of funds, 40,000 yuan was allocated to Jiangsu, 20,000 yuan to Shandong, 10,000 yuan to Hubei, 10,000 yuan to Guangdong, 5,000 yuan to Hunan, 4,000 yuan to Henan, 4,000 yuan to Jiangxi, 5,000 yuan to Fujian, and 1,000 yuan each to Anhui and Hebei on the morning of the 16th.

I will first go to Tongshan, and then to Pi, Pei, Jue, and other counties. Each place will be allocated funds for emergency relief according to the actual situation. After the inspection, I will return to Beijing and report to the central government. The fundamental governance of the Yellow River will also be recommended to the central government to avoid future disasters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Qiao Baoyuan, sent by the Provincial Relief Association to inspect the Xuzhou disaster, arrived in Xuzhou yesterday. This morning, he and Zhu Yuwu, a representative sent by the Finance Department, and Ge Fushou, a representative sent by the Agricultural Bank, went to northern Tongshan for inspection. Wang Gongyu prepared a boat in Zhengji and accompanied them along the lake to inspect more than 200 disaster-stricken villages, with 100,000 disaster victims. Wang has built 1,000 shelters in Zhengji, Mapo, and Maozhai to accommodate the victims. However, they are crying out for food and clothing and need widespread relief. Zhu and Wang discussed the loan method for plowing cattle and returned to Xuzhou in the evening. They will then go to Pei, Feng, Pi, and other places for inspection. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Han Asks the Political Council Again for Orders, and Huang Will Be Responsible for Blocking the Breach</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu telegraphed the Political Council on the 12th, requesting the Political Council to order the Huang River Water Conservancy Association to be responsible for blocking the breach. The Political Council ordered the Economic Committee to reply to Han by telegram, stating that the province has already made preparations for blocking the breach, and it is not appropriate to rashly change to an inexperienced person. If technical personnel are needed, the Lei Gong Water Conservancy Association should do its utmost to assist. They still hoped he would do his best, for which they were infinitely grateful and looked forward to his reply. Han replied by telegram stating that the weather was getting colder, and seven or eight hundred thousand poor people were crying from hunger and cold, and were still short of cotton clothing. He, Fuqu, really had difficulty sparing energy, and still requested that the Huang River Water Conservancy Association be ordered to be responsible. He was anxiously awaiting orders. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han telegraphed Chiang, briefly stating that since arriving in Shandong, he had exhausted all his efforts. The north had just reported peace when the Yellow River breached, affecting more than three million disaster victims, making banditry unavoidable. If one wants to fundamentally control the Yellow River and avoid banditry, one must divert the water. This is because the capacity of the riverbed below Lanfeng is only over 8,000 cubic meters per second, while the flow rate at the time of the breach exceeds 33,000 cubic meters per second. Even if the breach is blocked, another breach will be unavoidable next year when the water is high. It is proposed to build a control gate on the old course of the Yellow River in Lanfeng, so that the flow rate below Lanfeng is maintained at 8,000 cubic feet per second, and the old course of the Yellow River is dredged so that it can accommodate a flow rate of 8,000 cubic meters per second. This way the work is easy, the cost is small, the disaster can be avoided, and banditry can be eliminated. There is really no better plan than this. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The supervisory committee for donation taxes sent a letter to the provincial capital, requesting the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate the 40% of stamp tax revenue that should belong to the province and counties to be used as disaster relief funds.

<h3>Yaowan The West Embankment of the Canal Collapsed The Yellow River Entered the Six Ponds and the Water Level Rose Sharply The Counties Along the River Have Sent Urgent Telegrams</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to information from the Huai River Diversion Project Office, the west embankment of the Yaowan Canal collapsed at noon on the 15th, and the Yellow River flowed directly into the Six Ponds, causing the water level to rise sharply and approach the embankment. The counties along the Six Ponds River sent urgent telegrams. The Yi-Shu Flood Control Office also urgently telegraphed the counties, ordering them to rush to protect the embankments day and night. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today, the level of the Wei River dropped by two centimeters, remaining at 36.747 meters. The level of the Yao River rose by five inches, remaining at 256 inches. The level of the Su River rose by three inches, remaining at 202 inches. The level of the Qingjiang Gate remained at 244 inches. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Since the continued collapse of the Su-Supported Barrier Dike in Pixian County a few days ago, the main current has flowed directly to the Six Ponds, causing a section of the Yangkou River Dike in Shuyang to collapse horizontally on the 15th night. The waves crashed towards Laigou and eroded it. Frequent warnings were also issued within Guanyun. The biggest reason is that all kinds of barrier dikes, distant buildings, and weirs in Pixian and Suxian Counties were attacked by wind and waves, losing their effectiveness. Fortunately, the inner canal has not been in danger. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Huaiyin San Yi and Xiecheng Two Automobile Companies will suspend the long-distance bus routes on the Huaihai and Huaisu roads from today due to the high water in the Shuyang Liutang and Huaiyin Yanhe rivers. (Special dispatch from the 60th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to Hai Xun, after the Yellow River flooded into the Six Ponds River on the 11th, the river embankments in various sections of the irrigation area in Shuyang suffered complete water infiltration due to the high water level and newly built dikes. Now, the counties are urgently gathering manpower to step up protection. At the moment, the water level in the Shuyang River is level with the embankment, and the Qingkou River embankment has collapsed, flooding many people's fields and villages. (Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to Hai Xun, more than 300 gentlemen from Guanyun jointly telegraphed the National Government and the two directors, Wang and Kong, requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Government to instruct the Huai River Diversion Project Office to enlarge the gate of the Suqian Canal East Dam and demolish the Yangzhuang Old Yellow River Dam, so that the Yellow River can be diverted into the canal and into the sea, in order to avoid exclusively irrigating the Six Ponds River, which would sacrifice tens of millions of salt taxes in northern Jiangsu and the lives and property of tens of millions of people. Guanyun is the downstream confluence of the seven counties in the Liutang River basin. Recently, the Yellow River has flooded into the Liutang, and the situation is very urgent.

<h3>Kailuan Authorities Deny Transferring Equity</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The person in charge of the Kailuan Mining Bureau solemnly denied that the British shares of the mine would be transferred to the Japanese side or the South Manchuria Railway. The original shares of the mine totaled 20 million, and the public reserve fund used as shares totaled 8 million. China and Britain each had 14 million shares. Although business has been sluggish recently, the Zhao Gezhuang pit produced the most coal per day last year, about 5,000 tons. The Majiagou pit produced about 2,000 tons, and the rest of the Guye, Kaiping, and Tangjiazhuang produced a total of more than 4,000 tons, totaling about 12,000 to 13,000 tons per day. Due to the decline of industry in North China, sales have not been very strong. At the moment, there are 1.5 million tons of coal in storage. The mining bureau is doing its best to dump coal at low prices, and each mine is implementing a five-day work week to control production for adjustment. The British side believes that the news that the mine is being sold or that shares are being transferred is intended to have an effect. At the very least, it hopes that Britain will quickly withdraw from the war zone, so it does not argue about it. (Special dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<h3>Capital Cracks Down on Gambling Den A Large Number of Criminals Include Officials of the Political Council Wang Orders Investigation of Names and Suspension from Duty for Punishment</h3>

<h3>Wuhu Rice Market Turns Around: Chaozhou and Other Groups Release and Purchase Heavily; Tens of Thousands of Stones Exported Recently</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Agricultural products in Anhui Province are mostly rice, accounting for about 70% of agricultural products. Other products such as rapeseed, peanuts, cotton, sweet potatoes, and various miscellaneous grains are also produced in considerable quantities. In recent years, due to frequent disasters and unrest in the region, many rural areas have become bankrupt, and cities have also experienced severe economic panic. In addition, the dumping of cheap foreign rice has greatly affected the export of Anhui rice. The most famous Wuhu rice market has been sluggish for a long time. This year's new grain harvest has gradually improved the market. Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Yantai, and other ports have suffered from disasters and poor harvests. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces have also suffered major disasters. Therefore, all these places have sent personnel to Wuhu to purchase rice and grain to help the people's food. In the past week, the rice market has become active, and the riverbanks have been busy with volume measures all day, with a total transaction of about 60,000 to 70,000 stones, all of which were purchased by Chaozhou groups and miscellaneous groups such as Ruifa, Tongfeng, Huifeng, Tongxin, Tongfa, and Chengfeng rice shops. There are more than a hundred empty rice boats on the riverbanks. The rice boats that previously sailed to Jingzhen and other ports in the interior are flocking to Wuhu to meet the market, and the market is quite firm. Superior quality rice is six yuan and seven jiao per dan, this quality six yuan, one or two jiao, and the next is five yuan, seven or eight jiao. Nanling indica rice is still about three yuan. Currently, three iron rice loading ships hired by the Chaozhou group have arrived on the river surface on the 14th. Once they are full, they will set sail for export. There are about two reasons why the Wuhu rice market is gradually recovering: (1) The rice tax has been abolished, and the selling price is lower than in other places; (2) Rice merchants feel their own danger and have tried to eliminate all malpractices, so the future of the rice market has been revitalized. On the 15th, the Military Affairs Committee of the Commander-in-Chief sent a telegram to the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, roughly stating, "Autumn grain is harvested, and rice is on the market. Please report the prices and production quantities of various types of rice immediately for verification." After receiving the telegram, the County Chamber of Commerce immediately sent personnel to investigate in detail for reporting. In addition, rapeseed is also a major export product. About 400,000 to 500,000 bags are shipped to Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Japan every year. As of now, it is said that more than 200,000 bags have been exported. The rural areas in Anhui Province, which are about to go bankrupt, seem to have hope of recovery because of this. (15th)</p>
<h3>Shantou: North-South Trading at a Standstill; All Firms Face Closure After Bean Cake Surcharge Imposed</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Shantou North-South Goods Transportation Association has always occupied an important position in the business community and has a long history. Business establishments, representative offices, or distribution points established by major commercial ports in North China and Southeast Asia in Shantou have joined the association. These commercial firms also engage in banking and remittance business. The goods they trade include local sugar, pickled vegetables, sweet potato flour, palm sugar, coconut oil, tin foil, and paper that are shipped to the north, and soybeans, bean cake, various types of beans, peanuts, sorghum wine, barley, pickled winter vegetables, and rice that are procured from the north and brought to Shantou. They also rent cargo ships to travel to Southeast Asia, transporting oil beans and local products, and then transporting foreign rice, dried fish, etc. back to Shantou. This is why it is called the North-South Trade. The trade mainly deals in oil, rice, sugar, and groceries. Each firm has a substantial capital. Taking bean cake as an example, 7 million pieces are shipped from the north to Chaozhou and Shantou for sale every year, worth more than 15 million yuan. However, in the past year, there have been four waves of bean cake tax collection, which has dealt a heavy blow to farmers and merchants. Recently, the local government has increased taxes on oil, rice, and beans, and the firms of the association have closed down one after another, including Gongfa, Gonghe, Qianyuanli, Youlong, Anyulong, Dingchang, Hongfeng, Hongmao, Xiangfayuan, Dingsheng, Jinfa, Qianfengli, Xiangfeng, Hesheng, Yufayuan, Guangfeng, Yongdong, Qianxing, Anchang, Fengchanglong, Xiecheng, Deshengchang, Yongfa, Houfa, Dingda, Nanbeifeng, Yuanan, Jutai, Xiehe, Hesheng, Shoufa, Yuxingli, Yongqing, and Hechun. The above companies all have capital of hundreds of thousands of yuan. About half of them are still surviving. Whenever the government levies bean cake tax, it must first detain the goods and not allow them to be transported into the rural areas of the counties. Each time merchants jointly strike, they suffer losses of about one or two million yuan. Moreover, the government treats bean cake produced in Northeast China as imported goods, and charges an additional fee of 25 cents per dan. The commercial firms then switched to trading bean cake from Tianjin, Hankou, and Wuhu to Shantou for sale. This time, Lian'an Company has set up a collection office in Shantou, and all bean cake from Tianjin, Wuhu, and Hankou is also subject to additional fees and complicated procedures, such as bean cake tax stamps, which merchants find difficult to comply with. Therefore, all the firms have jointly stopped transporting bean cake. Currently, locally produced bean cake is also subject to additional fees, making it very difficult to compete with bean cake from Northeast China. Commercial firms such as Mian Yuchang, Chunfeng, Chunfa, Fengyuan, and Zengji have switched to trading bean cake from Northeast China. According to the association, the North-South Trade merchants have sent representatives to Guangzhou to petition for the abolition of the tax. If the petition is unsuccessful, the entire industry will inevitably collapse, because a foreign firm of a certain country has bean cake that is exempt from additional fees arriving in Shantou, and another 100,000 pieces will arrive soon. The soybean cake from Northeast China is entirely controlled by foreigners. When Chinese merchants trade, they have to bear tariffs, additional fees, and various other burdens, and will inevitably be eliminated sooner or later. Currently, the bean cake arriving in Shantou must be registered with Lian'an Company for arrears, guaranteed by Cai Shifan, the chairman of the association. Cai initially refused to bear this heavy burden, but after the firms wrote back the arrears to Cai, he resumed his responsibility. Recently, the North-South Trade merchants telegraphed the provincial government again for relief, especially requesting that the tax on oil beans be relaxed. The telegram stated, "If we try to reduce prices to sell, we will have no capital to lose; if we want to stay and wait for an opportunity, we lack the means to turn around. If we are required to pay special taxes again, our plight will deepen, and our demise will be accelerated." These words are truly poignant.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Shouguang County, Shandong Province; Fifty Elementary School Students Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: On the 28th of last month, at about 6 pm, more than 20 bandits suddenly broke into and surrounded the Nanhe Elementary School in Shouguang County. At that time, Principal Wang Zuoqing and the teachers had gone to the Fuxing Oil Mill to see the new machinery and were not at the school. The bandits tied up all the students except for six female students with hemp ropes. Before leaving, they fired more than 200 shots and crossed the enclosing wall. More than 20 children under the age of ten were weak and unable to support themselves and were sent back. Three students escaped when they reached Zhuobei Village, and another student escaped when they reached Yingzi Village. It is said that the bandits were moving very slowly because they were carrying students. After the case occurred, Principal Wang Zuoqing sent people to Heizhuzi Village, fifteen li away, to report to the two county governments and request troops to intercept and suppress the bandits. He also went to Xingyao, twelve li away, and urgently requested the county government to take action by telephone. The county magistrate replied that he would immediately send troops to intercept and suppress the bandits and would definitely not allow them to cross the river (i.e., Xiaoqing River). Soon, Director Gao of the Yangkou Maritime Public Security Bureau, Platoon Leader Xi of the Heizhuzi Village garrison militia, and Platoon Leader Gao of the Wanggao garrison militia were ordered to intercept and pursue the bandits separately. In less than seven hours, Director Gao set off at 9 pm that night, expecting to complete the deployment by 12 pm at the latest. Platoon Leader Xi's team searched back and forth all night through Zhoujiazhuang, Qiuhhezhuang, and Wopu Village, extremely exhausted. However, the bandits were now about ten li away from their patrol area. Platoon Leader Gao had not eaten when he received the order from the county government and set off immediately. When he arrived at Yingzi Village, he learned from the escaped students that the bandits had crossed the river at about 3 am. Currently, Principal Wang is investigating the school's losses and cooperating with the parents of the students to personally visit County Magistrate Song to request a solution. The county magistrate replied that he would rescue the students from danger within ten days. By the 3rd of this month, the county magistrate said that there was no solution. Principal Wang and the parents of the students will soon go to the provincial capital to petition, hoping to rescue the students as soon as possible. (15th)</p>

<p>Tax Police Killed a Man; County Magistrate's Thorough Investigation Reveals the Truth</p>
<p>Cheqiao Town in the eastern township of this county has never had tax police stationed there. However, since July of this year, Wei Guangdou, the captain of the tax police team, came to the town. A little over a week later, he unjustifiably shot and killed Sun Zichang, a civilian from Shijiaji. The team was fiercely resistant and did not surrender. After County Magistrate Yao ordered an examination, he also submitted the case to the Commissioner's Office, strongly arguing with the Huai-Yang Salt Transport Envoy's Office, detailing the truth of the case. While awaiting review and handling, Captain Wei arrested Yu Wan and two others for the second time, and arrested Shi Tingdong and three others for the third time, leading the team to torture them one after another. On the 8th of this month, the people of Shijiaji came to the town to petition for their release. Captain Wei turned to the people and opened fire as a warning, and then carried out indiscriminate searches along the streets and alleys north of the river, and set up posts at the northwest and east weimen, cutting off the surrounding traffic. The order was greatly disrupted at that time, and a total of 18 people were arrested and taken to the team. Some of them were not from Shijiaji but were also arrested. After taking them to the team, they were severely interrogated. The Cheqiao tax police repeatedly caused major cases. He immediately presented the case to Commissioner Wang and requested instructions. Commissioner Wang immediately ordered Secretary Liu to accompany the county magistrate to Cheqiao to investigate the situation. On the 10th, they arrived in Cheqiao overnight. The county magistrate and secretary went to the streets to investigate the situation early in the morning. Soon, Ji Tao and others who knew the situation in Shijiaji came to report that they had been brutally suppressed by the water police for more than 30 incidents. One after another, they came to complain. The county magistrate and secretary carefully questioned them one by one, and also examined the injuries, including cuts and beatings, in extremely tragic conditions. Each victim personally pressed their fingerprints. Among them, the Sun case was the key. According to Shi Tingdong, Sun Zichang was selling sorghum at the market at that time, three dou, 780 jiao per dou, and presented the verification of the market on that day, which proved that he was not selling smuggled salt. After a thorough investigation of this case, the people's grievances were cleared, and the truth was revealed.</p>

<h3>Shanghai: Hong Kong National Bank Closed Yesterday; Head Office Revolving Fund also Ordered to be Liquidated; Assets Situation is Good, Social Impact is Small; Ministry of Finance Instructs that Assets be Deposited with the Bankers Association</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong National Commercial Savings Bank experienced a run earlier this month due to the closure of Guangdong Bank. Although the bank tried its best to maintain operations, it eventually ran out of reserves. The board of directors decided that the head office and branches would be closed simultaneously yesterday. It is said that it will be reorganized and resume operations. According to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment History</p>
<p>The Hong Kong National Commercial Savings Bank opened in 1921. It was organized by overseas Chinese gentlemen Ma Yingbiao, Tang Xin, Wang Guoxuan, and Yong Mingjue, and other manufacturers. The initial capital was 2 million yuan (Hong Kong dollars). The head office was located in Hong Kong. Since its opening, its business has developed rapidly. In 1924, the capital was increased to 5 million yuan. Branches were opened in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin. Sub-branches were opened in Kowloon. Agencies were established in major commercial ports in foreign countries, specializing in all banking businesses. The Shanghai branch joined the Shanghai Bankers Association in 1928 and became a member of the Joint Reserve Committee and the 27th clearing bank of the clearing house. It also reported to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Directors and Managers</p>
<p>The chairman of the board of directors of the bank is Cai Xing. The directors are Ma Yingbiao, Tang Xin, Li Qiuduoming, Guo Quan, Du Zewen, Ma Zurong, Cai Chang, Ma Yongcan, Tang Rongyao, Tan Weili, Tang Yichuan, Lin Quanhhe, and Wang Guoxuan. The director and manager is Wang Guoxuan. The manager of the Shanghai branch was originally Lu Zhongqing. He resigned to the board of directors last month, and Huang Jiyan was hired to succeed him. He took office at the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>Closure Process</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, Guangdong Bank closed, causing panic in the Hong Kong financial community. The National Bank was affected because it was located next to Guangdong Bank, and a run occurred. Although the head office tried its best to find a solution at that time, it was short of cash. Therefore, the board of directors decided to announce to the depositors that 1/5 of the deposits would be paid starting from the 5th, and another 1/5 would be paid after ten days. The Shanghai branch had a better situation, so no run occurred. It also remitted money to Hong Kong. It is said that an emergency meeting was held last week to ask the directors to pay cash to help with the turnover, but all the directors present politely declined, so they had to temporarily close down.</p>
<p>Situation in Shanghai</p>
<p>When the run occurred at the head office in Hong Kong, the news spread very urgently. The Shanghai branch of the bank, as a member of the association, was related to the member banks. In order to understand the situation of the bank, the Bankers Association sent its secretary-general, Lin Kanghou, to visit Huang Jiyan, the manager of the branch, to inquire about everything. According to his reply, although there was a run, he thought it would be calmed down soon. In fact, the actual situation was not as bad as the telegram said. The fixed deposits of the Shanghai branch were only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, while the assets exceeded the liabilities by more than double. Therefore, even if it was unfortunately forced to close down, the depositors would be able to get back their full amount. Therefore, since the run occurred in the Shanghai branch, there was no news of instability.</p>
<p>Closure Announcement</p>
<p>However, the head office eventually ran out of cash, and the turnover was not smooth, and it was forced to close down. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai branch did not open. At about 9 o'clock, an announcement was posted, saying, "Now, we are ordered by the board of directors of our head office to temporarily close our branch and await reorganization. This is hereby announced on September 16, 1935, by the Shanghai Hong Kong National Bank." The branches in Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places also announced their closure at the same time. As of last night, the Bankers Association had not received a formal announcement from the bank. When the reporter visited Lin Kanghou, he said that he thought the news was unfortunate, but the association had not received a formal notification, so there was no action. According to Lin, the situation in the Shanghai branch was stable, but it was ordered to close down by the head office, and it had not requested assistance from the association in advance, so there was no way to provide relief. It is heard that the bank is preparing to reorganize and resume operations. It is difficult to predict whether there is hope. The public opinion is that the bank has run aground, and it will inevitably lead to liquidation.</p>
<p>Withdrawal from Clearing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee Clearing House issued Announcement No. 45 yesterday, saying, "Approved the letter from the 27th clearing bank, the Hong Kong National Bank, on September 16, stating that our bank is ordered by the head office to suspend business and temporarily withdraw from the clearing from today." Since the bank has closed down, the request to temporarily withdraw from the clearing will take effect from today. In addition to reporting to the Executive Committee and notifying the banks for reference, this is hereby announced, Manager Zhu Boquan.</p>
<p>Assets and Liabilities</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation, the bank's asset and liability situation in 1933 was as follows: the total amount was more than 13.9 million yuan, the total amount of deposits was about 7.1 million yuan, the total amount of loans was more than 5.1 million yuan, the total amount of paid-in capital was 2,574,100 yuan, and the public reserve was 200,000 yuan. The bank has also issued banknotes. As of the end of that year, the total amount issued by the branches was only more than 10,000 yuan. Judging from its income and expenditure situation, it is sufficient to pay, and the deposits are not much, and the banknotes issued are also very few, so when the liquidation is carried out in the future, except for the depositors who may suffer losses, it will not have a serious impact on the general financial situation.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instruction</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Shanghai Bankers Association yesterday: "Today, the Shanghai Hong Kong National Commercial Savings Bank has been affected by the head office in Hong Kong and has been closed. Although the bank has not been registered with the Ministry, it has been a member bank of the association for many years. Therefore, the local industries have quite a lot of dealings with it. In order to protect the interests of the local creditors and stabilize the market, the Ministry hereby urgently orders the association to quickly find out the actual situation of the bank's assets and liabilities, and order it to immediately deposit all its assets with the association, without any movement or concealment, and immediately realize them separately, so as to pay off the local debts. There must be no violation, and please telegraph the Tianjin and Hankou Bankers Associations to handle it in the same way. This order."</p>

<h3>Chinese and British Committees for Yunnan-Burma Boundary Survey: Our Side's Members Depart for Yunnan Tomorrow. All Committee Members and Staff Have Assembled in Shanghai. Boarding the Ship at 10 PM Tonight, Weighing Anchor at 1 AM Tomorrow Morning.</h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: The Chinese members of the China-British Yunnan-Burma Boundary Commission, Liang Yu-gao and Yin Ming-de, along with their secretaries and staff, all arrived in Shanghai yesterday. They are scheduled to board the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Jefferson tonight at 10 PM and depart at 3 AM tomorrow morning for Hong Kong, then transfer to Haiphong and proceed to Yunnan. Mr. Liang and others are scheduled to hold a press conference at the New Asia Hotel at 11 AM this morning to report on the purpose of this trip. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Our Committee Members: All Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Chinese members of the China-British Yunnan-Burma Boundary Commission, Liang Zi-gao, Yin Ming-de, and their entourage, were originally scheduled to depart from Beijing for Shanghai on the 10th of this month. However, due to various necessary items not being fully prepared, all personnel postponed their trip to the area. Mr. Liang Zi-gao arrived in Shanghai ahead of schedule on the 13th to prepare everything. It is now known that the remaining staff, led by secretaries Li Li-ying and Tang Cheng-hu, departed from Beijing at 8 AM on the 15th and arrived at 3 PM that afternoon. Committee member Yin Ming-de stayed in Beijing due to business and only arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 1:30 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Boarding the Ship Tonight: Heading to Hong Kong, then to Yunnan</p>
<p>After all of our committee members gathered in Shanghai yesterday, it was decided that they would board the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Jefferson tonight to go to Hong Kong and then to Yunnan. The President Jefferson is scheduled to arrive in port at 6 AM today and will dock at the Dollar Steamship Lines wharf in Baitianjing, Pudong. It will weigh anchor at 1 AM tomorrow morning, so Mr. Liang, Mr. Yin, and other personnel must board the ship before 10 PM tonight. It is also learned that because the trip to the Yunnan border is long and the living conditions in the border areas are inadequate, all kinds of necessary living supplies, such as folding beds, tents, tables, and stools, must be specially made and carried along. In addition, the surveying instruments used for boundary demarcation work and the luggage they carry are extremely heavy. The luggage was shipped to Shanghai on the 15th and is currently stored at the North Station. After the President Jefferson arrives in Shanghai this morning, a special commissioner will be sent to be responsible for transporting it.</p>
<p>Committee Member Yin Ming-de's Interview</p>
<p>Committee member Yin Ming-de spoke to a Shen Shi News Agency reporter at his residence yesterday. According to him, he, Committee member Liang Zi-gao, and their party were originally scheduled to depart on the 10th, but were delayed by five days in coming to Shanghai due to the incomplete preparation of various equipment and supplies. Now, all personnel have gathered in Shanghai and are scheduled to depart on the President Jefferson tomorrow night (i.e., tonight). The journey is expected to take 19 days to reach Hong Kong, where they will transfer to a ship to Haiphong, and then take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming. After meeting with Chairman Long Yun and others to discuss matters, they will depart from Kunming for the Yunnan border in late October. The journey along that road is the most difficult. There are no other means of transportation besides horses and rope bridges, and the trip will take about 40 days. If it rains, it will take even longer. Therefore, they are expected to arrive at their destination in mid-November. At that time, they will prepare to start work. The Yunnan-Burma border has a lot of malaria, but it is less prevalent between late winter and early spring. This period must be used to complete the survey work. The scope and principles of this survey work are based on the exchange of documents between China and Britain in April of this year. The steps to be taken will be to conduct a detailed inspection first, then draw maps based on the measurement and inspection results, and then investigate boundary markers and determine boundary lines. After the survey work is completed, a committee meeting will be held in Yunnan. After the meeting, the on-site survey will be reported to the government in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the exchange of documents, and individual opinions will be submitted to the government for reference when necessary, he said.</p>
<p>British Committee Members Have Also Departed</p>
<p>After our committee members depart, neutral committee member Mr. Islam is also scheduled to depart from Switzerland in mid-October. As for the British committee members Mr. J. Clague and Mr. T.S. Grose, Mr. Grose is originally a British government official stationed in Burma and is already in Burma. Mr. Clague also departed from India on the 15th with his staff. It is expected that the neutral and Chinese and British committee members will be able to meet at the destination by the end of November.</p>
<p>Meeting with Reporters This Morning</p>
<p>It is also learned that after our committee members Liang Yu-gao and Yin Ming-de arrived in Shanghai, given the imminent departure and the public's attention to the China-British Yunnan-Burma boundary survey, they have specifically scheduled 11 AM today at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road to meet with reporters from various newspapers in the city to report on everything.</p>

<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Assist with Disaster Relief</h3>

The brokers' association sent a letter donating 1,000 yuan. The Shanghai Flour Exchange brokers donated 100 bags of flour, with each broker donating 20 bags of flour, totaling 1,200 bags.

Various sectors also donated old clothes, trousers, hats, cotton quilts, shoes, and socks, reflecting the general enthusiasm of all sectors for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The local flood relief committee has been conducting flood relief fundraising in the city for several days, with excellent results. Recently, the committee received 5,000 yuan remitted by overseas Chinese in Medan via Nanjing for emergency flood relief in the country. Because there is no unified flood relief organization in Nanjing, it will be remitted to Shanghai within days. It is also learned that the Chinese Catholic Progress Association's national diocesan representatives conference, for the purpose of providing emergency disaster relief, saved on banquet expenses and the bishops, priests, and representatives from various dioceses attending the conference donated a total of 20,000 yuan, which will also be collected and submitted to the committee by the Catholic Progress Association soon.</p>
<h3>Guangdong's Chen Sends Disaster Relief Representatives to Shanghai: 60,000 Yuan in Relief Funds Have Been Distributed to Various Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Chen Ji-tang, director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters, given the severe floods in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, specially dispatched Guangdong representatives Fan Jian-jiang and Wang Ren-kang to the affected areas to provide disaster relief. They departed from Guangdong on the 15th of last month. Due to the urgency of the disaster situation, they did not stop in Shanghai but went directly to Beijing. They first went to Hankou, then to Changsha, and then went north along the Pinghan Railway to Kaifeng, Baoding, Beijing, and then to Jinan and Xuzhou, and inspected the Yellow River diversion project. They only arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The disaster situation in the areas they passed through was severe, unprecedented in hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Distribution of Relief Funds</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reporters met with Mr. Fan at his residence yesterday. According to him, he and his colleagues came on the orders of Director Chen, on the one hand representing the Guangdong provincial government to express condolences to the disaster victims, and on the other hand carrying relief funds from the Guangdong Benevolent General Hall to provide disaster relief in the affected areas. They only brought 60,000 yuan on this trip. When passing through Beijing, they met with Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee and discussed the allocation. It was decided to allocate 20,000 yuan to Hubei, 15,000 yuan to Shandong, 10,000 yuan to Hunan, 5,000 yuan to Henan, 2,000 yuan to Hebei, 1,000 yuan each to Anhui and Jiangxi, and 5,000 yuan for temporary emergency relief, totaling 60,000 yuan. Feeling that the disaster victims in the affected areas were too numerous and that these meager funds were of no help, he will report back to Director Chen for a further decision.</p>
<p>Organization of the Benevolent Hall</p>
<p>According to Mr. Fan, this trip represented the Guangdong Benevolent General Hall to distribute relief. The Benevolent General Hall is organized under the leadership of Guangdong Pacification Commissioner Chen Ji-tang. It was initiated in September of last year and began work in November. The predecessor of this benevolent hall was the Public Welfare Hall during Mr. Liao Zhongkai's time. Now its organization has been expanded and its name has been changed. This year, it began recruiting members, divided into military, political, educational, and commercial teams. The matters handled include providing medical care, infant care, elderly care, providing coffins, disaster relief, charity schools, and orphan care. Monthly expenses are approximately 15,000 yuan. There is a board of directors, with Director Chen serving as chairman.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Received Flood Relief Donations Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Participating Manufacturers in the Singapore National Products Exhibition Scheduled to Depart Today. More Than 250 Crates of National Products Have Been Packed and Shipped.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Commerce have been invited by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce to hold a national products exhibition.

<h3>Haiheng Delayed Due to Wind: Encountered Wind on the Waters of Baiquan Island. Fortunately, Captain Ma Jia-jun Navigated Successfully</h3>
<p>According to a report from the astronomical observatory yesterday, the center of the hurricane is 60 miles away. The hurricane is now passing between 115 degrees east longitude and 18 degrees north latitude. The wind is currently moving rapidly north-northwest. Whether it will hit Shanghai is still difficult to predict, but some ships on the South China line have already been hit by strong winds. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiheng was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong, Shantou, and Guangzhou yesterday. The ship is a regular liner, but recently its voyage has been shortened and its frequency has been increased, so it is usually punctual. The Sihai has been rescheduled to depart from Shanghai on Tuesdays and Fridays. Unexpectedly, after the Haiheng left Shantou, it encountered strong winds and waves in the sea 20 nautical miles south of Baiquan Island. The turbulent waves were overwhelming, but fortunately Captain Ma Jia-jun, the most experienced captain of the Haiheng, was able to calmly direct the ship and maintain full power. The ship, which normally travels at 14 nautical miles per hour, was reduced to 5 nautical miles per hour, resulting in the delay yesterday. This shows the strength of the wind. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Captain Ma stating that they will be able to arrive in port today.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to the Court Requesting Enforcement of the Jin Xing Mortgage Judgment. Jin Xing Real Estate Company Colludes with Foreign Merchants to Fabricate Facts and Seize Rent.</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai First District Court yesterday, requesting that the judgment in the Yexing Company case be enforced. The letter stated: "To the honorable court, (omitted) The Central Trust Company and others have taken over the mortgage of the Jin Xing Real Estate Company's property. Because Jin Xing Company has ignored overdue interest, the banks and firms have filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. The court has ruled to allow the prior attachment of the rent on the mortgaged property for the sake of preserving future enforcement, and ordered the tenants to pay the rent to the creditor for safekeeping in the court. If the Jin Xing Company has any objections to the decision, it can file a lawsuit of objection to the court through proper procedures. However, it has repeatedly colluded with third parties to fabricate facts and take extrajudicial actions. Its intention to maliciously harm the creditor's rights is obvious. If the court's decision at the time to attach the rent on the mortgaged property in advance is not enforced, it will be difficult to protect the legitimate interests of the creditor. In addition to replying by letter, we also send a letter to request the court to uphold justice and enforce the Yexing Company judgment in this case in order to protect the creditor's rights."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Public Bonds: Tenth Lottery to be Held on Schedule</h3>

<h3>Lawyers Association Conference Rescheduled: Starts on September 23</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a notice to the Lawyers Associations of all provinces in the country yesterday: "To the honorable associations, the 7th Representative Conference of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China was previously scheduled to be held at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Rue Pere Robert, Avenue Emile Zola, Shanghai, starting on September 23. We have already notified you by special letter. However, the date of this representative conference was agreed upon with the association, intending to take advantage of the convenience of the representatives of the Lawyers Delegation attending the National Judicial Conference traveling to Beijing to come to Shanghai to attend. Now, most of the representatives of the associations traveling to Beijing have left Beijing. Moreover, the association itself has a rule that the notice for holding a representative conference should be given two months in advance. After notification by the association, regarding the previously scheduled date of the representative conference of our association, there are conflicts in terms of association rules and facts and should be rescheduled. We hereby send this letter to inform you that the previously scheduled date of September 23 for the 7th Representative Conference of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Rue Pere Robert, Avenue Emile Zola, Shanghai, should be canceled. We will notify you of the rescheduled date separately. Thank you for your attention."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Air Association's Fundraising Team's 29th Office Meeting: Discussing Fundraising Progress Matters</h3>

It had been actively prepared previously and was to be held at the Paramount Ballroom in autumn. It has now been decided to change the venue to the International Hotel in October, with wonderful performances. All proceeds will be used for fundraising. The coal industry has been tasked by this office with assigning Secretaries Zhu and Li to be responsible for rectifying the affairs of the collection committee and recovering outstanding donations, and has sent letters to the various sub-bureaus of the Public Security Bureau to strictly pursue the matter. The outstanding donations are being paid in succession, very enthusiastically. This month's performance is also better than before. We hope to make practical efforts to supervise and promote it, so that it will become increasingly vigorous. The collection of aviation donations at dance halls has been very successful. Recently, a meeting of representatives of all dance halls in the city was convened to discuss changing the methods. It is currently being studied and discussed. We must make practical efforts to handle it. All collectors should go to the dance halls during business hours to work and must not be negligent. The responsible contact persons and secretaries should also make efforts to promote it. The Shanghai Air Defense Exhibition will be held next month to promote public knowledge and interest in air defense. The various bureaus of the Municipal Government are responsible for the preparation, so as to promote the protection of families and directly help the fundraising campaign and increase strength. During this time, we should do our best to publicize it, so that citizens pay attention to saving the country through aviation and can enthusiastically donate to achieve our goals. Afterwards, the field secretaries reported on the progress of contact and inspection, and discussed many fundraising plans. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Water Disaster Entertainment Fair: Continues to Allocate 5,000 Yuan to the Relief Committee. Dance Contest to be Held at the International Tonight</h3>

<h3>Rue du Père Robert: Unresolved Dispute Over the Banning of Vegetable Vendors; Sixteen Arrested Vegetable Vendors Released Yesterday; Shopkeepers Appeal for Justice and Ask the Police to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the vegetable stalls on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession have been banned and strictly expelled by the French police. The vendors, whose livelihoods have been cut off, have sent nine representatives to petition the French police to maintain the stalls, but to no avail. Therefore, the shops along Shaanxi Road jointly sent a letter to the French Consul-General, the French Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting them to uphold justice and protect the stall businesses. The Xin Xin She reporter will now report the details as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Expelled Vendors Returned</p>
<p>The sixteen vendors who were arrested by the police the day before yesterday were released yesterday. Because their daily lives depend entirely on setting up stalls to maintain their families' livelihoods, the vendors separately petitioned the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession and the First Special District Citizens' Federation, requesting relief. Yesterday, they unanimously moved back to Kang Ti Road to set up stalls in order to maintain their families' lives. Unexpectedly, starting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the French police again sent four patrolmen to expel all the vendors and take their business tools to the police station, forcing each to pay a fine of two yuan to retrieve them. The vendors, unable to afford the fines, were unable to redeem their tools and set up stalls. Under these circumstances, the vendors were in a state of panic and are now planning to petition the city's party and government agencies tomorrow in the hope of restoring their stalls.</p>
<p>Jointly Request Permission to Set Up Stalls</p>
<p>The shops on Kang Ti Road, including Gongda Rice Shop, Wanyuan Sauce Shop, Hu Shangshan Pharmacy, Xieyu Pawnshop, Xinchangsheng Rice Shop, Xietai Cotton Shop, Hongyun Restaurant, Yongshunchang, Yida, Shentaichang, Yixiangqi, Xinan Company, Zhaokang, Jiuda, Gu Runde, Hengchang, Gongji, Yuantai, Yuanshengxiang, Ruchun Restaurant, Yongshengtai, Jiuyi Tobacco Company, Zhongyuanhao, Wang Yongxing, Xiangtai Hang, Hengtaixin, Gaoshunxing, Xurongtai, Bojiugui, Lu Gaojian, Wang Dexin, Lao Zhengxing Shengji, Gonghe, Shengtai, Wanxing, Fuyuan, Xiangyun, Heng, Yilean, Dinghua, Yitaixin, Dexintai, Xietai Cheng, Hengda, Zhu Dingxin, Qingxinxiang, Xingji, Zhu Shunji, and Chen Shengtai, a total of fifty-one shops, believe that the establishment of these stalls has always been convenient. Therefore, yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to the French Inspector General's Office, the French Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting them to protect the vendors and allow them to set up stalls. The original letter is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Letter to the French Consul-General Requesting Protection</p>
<p>We are writing to inform you that the section of Kang Ti Road from the east end of the Cabbage Market to Avenue Ruve has had vegetable stalls for seven years. The shops and general residents have found it convenient, and the market has relied on it for prosperity. Therefore, the market has flourished for several years. Unexpectedly, your police suddenly banned them and strictly expelled them. The shops were panicked by the situation. The surface of Kang Ti Road is relatively wide, and the establishment of the stalls does not hinder traffic. Moreover, it benefits the market. Furthermore, on June 24, 1931, Mr. Fevrier, the Director-General of your police, sent a letter to the shops temporarily allowing the stalls to remain. At a time when all industries are sluggish and people's livelihoods are declining, restoring the market should be promoted. Therefore, we jointly request that Your Excellency consider the sluggishness of the market as a prerequisite for revitalizing the market and show compassion for the livelihoods of the vendors, allowing the police to maintain the previous case and temporarily suspend the ban. We would be most grateful. Addressed to Mr. Gabriel, Director-General of the French Inspector General's Office.</p>

<h3>Rent Reduction Association Holds Representatives Conference Yesterday; Petitioning the City Party Department to Ban False Fundraising</h3>
<p>The First Special District Branches of the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee held a representatives conference of district branches yesterday afternoon and resolved to assist the cases of Hartung Properties and others. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Conference</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the association held a representatives conference of district branches. Ten representatives from District 2, Zhu Rongping from District 1, Wu Shuying from District 4, Zhang Xianfang and Zhang Yumen from District 5, Qiu from District 6, Liu Zhongying from District 7, Fang Peicheng from District 8, Zhang Chiseng from District 9, Zhu Baoluo from District 10, Chen Binghui from District 11, Cao Zhigong from District 12, Qiu Pingshan from District 14, Zhu Zhichun and Lu Rongtang from District 15, Chen Jicheng from District 16, Hu Fengxiang and Chen Shude from District 18, Zhen Xiang from District 19, Kui from District 22, Zhang Yichen from District 24, Zheng Dongshan from District 26, Xu Jutang from District 27, Tang Yi from District 28, Zhou Xianwen from District 29, Xing Guxiang and Yu Yaoqiu from District 30, Song Shiqi, Fei Liangheng from District 31, Cai Qiajun from District 32, Wu Binghua from District 34, Zheng Xiaolin and Ren Nongxuan from District 35, Zheng from District 38, and Ge Fuyi, etc., more than 40 people attended to discuss the following matters: (1) Hartung Properties Case: Resolved: A. Send a letter to the First Special District City Council requesting serious handling, secretly. B. Notify shops in various districts to unite against Hartung's houses and uniformly delay rent. C. Hartung Properties must automatically reduce rent and apologize to the shops on Nanjing Road in newspapers. D. Notify shops on various roads and houses to separately organize rent reduction associations to demand uniform rent reduction. E. Conduct rent reduction mobilization. Slogans in various shops must be posted to re-propagate. Banning false fundraising to facilitate rent reduction work: Resolved: A. For all abnormal organizations, send a letter to the First Special District City Council requesting the Party to ban them. B. The so-called Rent Reduction General Association charges shops an opening fee, which is a form of fundraising. It is countless for shops in the city to be charged these fees. The income is considerable, but rent reduction has not been achieved, and it has increased the burden on merchants. Send a letter to the First Special District City Council requesting the Party and government to thoroughly investigate and punish the illegal. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Letter to the City Federation</p>
<p>The association sent a letter to the First Special District Citizens' Federation stating, "We are writing to inform you that the branch associations of this association, in response to requests from various roads under their jurisdiction, including Fuzhou Road, Caojiadu Roads, Shanghai Fourth Road, Hankou Lure Road, Sixteenth, Chexi Huade Road, Broadway Road, Henan Road, Baker Road, Yuezhou Road Ten Road, Five Horse Road, Edward Road, Chongqing Road, Suzhou, Shanxi Road, Xinzha Road, Jiujiang Road, Yangshupu Road, Hong Kong Road, Sichuan Zai, Beijing Road, Jiangxi Road, Zhejiang Road, Wenjianshi Road, Haining Road, Yinxiang Port, Huade Road, Airzine Road, Qipu Road, Xizang Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Ningbo Road, Tianjin Road, Wuchang Road, Ma Road, and Four Horse Road, to reduce rent to maintain commerce, have been established. For a year, they have not been able to achieve unification. The rent reduction movement week held before was magnificent and awakened the need to reduce rent for the whole mountain. Unexpectedly, there are fees ranging from five yuan, called opening fees. Shop rent reduction has not been achieved, and the burden has increased. The whole city charges a uniform fee, how can the benefit be won? Now, in order to eliminate civil harm and maintain public interest, in addition to notifying the shops on various roads that if there is such a donation, they can be arrested for investigation, the corresponding letter requests the council to quickly submit a request to the Party and government agencies to investigate and handle according to law, for the sake of justice."</p>
<p>Present to the City Party Department</p>
<p>The association presented a document to the City Party Department stating, "It is hereby submitted to thoroughly ban fundraising in the name of rent reduction. This association previously requested your department to investigate and deal with Longjiazhai Za, No. 73 Shanghai Rent Reduction United General Association for Tenants, which is using the name of rent reduction to extort and charge fees from various shops and households. It is expected that the investigation will be clarified and dealt with. This association is sometimes called the Shanghai Zhabei Hongkou Rent Reduction United General Association, and sometimes called the Shanghai Rent Reduction United General Association for All Tenants. The name is changed from time to time, and the blank paper characters are still posted. The purpose is to increase the wantonness. The day before yesterday, it was held at the New Asia Restaurant to entertain the press. The report was splendid and announced that the fee collection included a 5 yuan opening fee for group membership and a yuan development fee for each shop. For rent reduction work, the general concept of not being able to collect fees is that the rent reduction movement should be automatically organized by various Li Lungs and shops. It is the responsibility of the city residents to request the organization of the union, to plan for self-help, reduce the burden of rent, and to execute the committee's implementation by the citizens' request. It is by no means the case that the association dispatches people to various Chinese and foreign shops to increase the burden, which is neither legal nor compliant. In order to solemnly carry out rent reduction work and promote the speech of the people, this rent reduction is detrimental to the city's people. There is nothing like this. This matter is related to the cause of rent reduction, and it is difficult to remain silent. Together, we should request your department to approve a thorough investigation, audit the rent reduction, quickly and severely punish, and show justice."</p>

<h3>Huge Post Office Bureau Robbery Case; Five Starving People Are the Most Suspected; Permission to Detain Until the 23rd for Further Interrogation; The Rest Will Be Released After Investigation</h3>
<p>In the case of the robbery of 91,000 yuan from the Post Office General Bureau, the bodyguard Lu Ruilin and the old clerk Yuan Bingshu were shot and killed, and the bodyguard Zhou Chen was shot and injured. After strict investigation by the police authorities, Chen Yuqing, a suspect in the case, was captured by the Hongkou police station and sent to the court for interrogation and detention. In the wee hours of the 13th of this month, at about 3 o'clock, the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police received a secret report stating that the robbers in this case were hiding at No. 23 Qingyu Nanli on Beijingjiang Road and at the new house in Panjiawan, Tanzhiwan Road (still to be numbered). Inspector Lu Shugui led detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Song Bingzheng, Wang Chengying, detectives Liu Junjie, Zhao, Fuhai, Bao Lisheng, etc., in separate groups to the above two locations, where they joined with police detectives from the Public Security Bureau to carry out the arrests. Huang Huaizhen, a native of Siyang, and his wife, Huang Jiang, were arrested in Panjiawan, and Yu Guanfa, Wang Ruqing, Xie Doulin, Zhuang Hongtian, Feng Licheng, Feng Zicheng, Feng Si, Zhang Jizhong, Hu Junye, and Feng Yushi, ten natives of Siyang, were arrested on Beijingjiang Road. Seventy yuan in one-yuan bills, bundled with hemp rope, were found under Yu's bed. With the consent of the Public Security Bureau, they were taken back to the police station. Meanwhile, detectives were ordered to guard Yu's two houses. At 9:00 a.m. on the 14th, Li Dejin, a native of Qingjiang, went to No. 23 Qingyu Nanli. As soon as he entered, he saw the detectives inside and immediately ran away. After the detectives chased him with all their might, they finally captured Li and brought him back to the police station. The post office was also ordered to identify whether the confiscated money was the stolen money. According to the staff of the bureau, the banknotes could not be identified, but the hemp rope used to bundle the banknotes was the same as that used by the bureau to tie the banknotes. After investigation by the police station, it was determined that Yu Guanfa, Huang Huaizhen, Xie Doulin (also known as Feng Ming), Wang Ruqing, and Li Dejin were the most suspected, while the others seemed to have no substantial connection. As soon as it is determined that there is no connection, they can be released. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, the police station sent Yu, Xie, Wang, and Li to the First Special Court's First Criminal Division, while Huang Huaizhen was also listed as a defendant, but because of his illness, he was not sent to the court. Presiding Judge Feng Shide took the stand for interrogation and, according to the police lawyer Jiang Baolian, explained the circumstances of the arrest. The police station is conducting a strict investigation and requested permission to detain Yu Guanfa, Huang Huaizhen, Xie Doulin, Wang Qing, and Li Dejin, etc. The court questioned Yu Guanfa about the source of the 70 yuan. According to his confession, it was given to him by a Liu Rongfu, not robbed. Judge Feng then ordered Yu and the other five defendants to be detained and interrogated again on the 23rd.</p>

<h3>Radio Receivers Must Be Registered; Penalty for Non-Registration; Deadline at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications previously issued a circular ordering all radio stations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications to handle the registration of radio receivers free of charge in order to investigate the number of radio receivers nationwide, so as to facilitate overall statistics and seek to adjust and develop radio functions. In this city, the registration is handled by International Telecommunications, Kenyee Building, No. 355 Beijing Road. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the registration has been widely welcomed since it was announced in the newspapers and with the cooperation of radio stations in the city. As of recently, it has exceeded 40,000 households. In addition, there are about 1,000 foreign residents in Shanghai who have radio receivers. It is also said that the Ministry of Communications will start statistics as soon as the registration procedures are completed. For example, the distribution of radio stations will be re-allocated based on the number of radio receivers in a certain area, and radio programs will also be re-adjusted. However, all of this cannot be achieved in a short period of time and will have to wait for accurate statistics. The registration deadline is set for the end of this month and will not be extended. If it is found that the registration has not been done after the deadline, a penalty will be imposed in accordance with the Telecommunications Regulations of the Ministry of Communications. However, new purchases can be registered with the bureau at any time.</p>

<h3>Yi Fangshuo Case: Renewed Trial Today</h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, also known as the leader of the Fangshuo Spiritual Troupe and a native of Hangzhou, who was at No. 147, Baxianfang Entrance, Huagequan Road, French Concession, and performed licentious song and dance dramas at the Xinxin Company rooftop playground on Nanjing Road, is 44 years old this year. Previously, he was accused by his cousins, Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen, of raping them. Baozhu reported the case to the French Concession police, and on November 11th of last year, the Yi case was sent to the Special Second Court for investigation and detention. It was also discovered that Yi purchased women, such as Yang Lingzhu and Yi Jinzhu, and made them learn drama, monitoring their freedom of movement. Subsequently, the police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution on three counts: disrupting public morals, family, and freedom. During the trial, Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen withdrew their accusations. The court then proceeded with the trial on the counts of disrupting family and freedom. As a result, on the 27th of the same month, Yi Fangshuo was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for depriving people of their freedom of movement through illegal means, found not guilty on the charge of disrupting family, and the charge of disrupting public morals was not accepted. During the appeal period, he was held in custody and not allowed bail. Yi, dissatisfied with the verdict, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the trial concluded, the court overturned the original verdict and sentenced Yi Fangshuo to three years of imprisonment for jointly enslaving others. Yi remained dissatisfied and filed a third appeal with the Nanjing Supreme Court. The details of these events have been reported in previous newspapers. The case has now been reviewed by the Supreme Court, which found that there were still unclear points in the case. Therefore, it specifically overturned the original verdict and returned the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for a new trial. After receiving the Supreme Court's verdict in the detention center, Yi Fangshuo immediately petitioned the Third Branch of the High Court to request a speedy trial. The High Court, after receiving the petition, scheduled a hearing for this afternoon. This case has attracted considerable attention from the public. There will undoubtedly be many bystanders at the hearing, and his defense lawyer will once again unleash his eloquence to defend his wealthy client and absolve him of guilt.</p>
<h3>After the Closing of the Catholic Representative Conference, a Declaration to Assist the Government Was Issued. Chairman Lin Sent a Letter to Wish the Conference Success. The Entire Delegation Went to Sheshan for Pilgrimage Yesterday and Returned to Shanghai That Evening.</h3>
<p>The National Representative Conference of the Chinese Catholic Action Association concluded the day before yesterday. The conference received a handwritten letter from Chairman Lin of the National Government, congratulating them on their success. In addition, the conference issued a declaration to inform the people of the country. Yesterday, the entire delegation, led by Archbishop Cai Ning, went to Sheshan in Songjiang for a pilgrimage and returned to Shanghai that evening. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Handwritten Letter Congratulating Success: Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a letter to the conference, congratulating them on the success of the conference and requesting that the respects and deep gratitude of the Pope be conveyed. The original letter stated: "To Archbishop Ning and to the Presidium and all members of the Chinese Catholic Action Association: It is with great joy that I learned that the First National Representative Conference of the Chinese Catholic Action Association began its meetings in Shanghai on September 8th, with the common intention of assisting the government and promoting construction. I deeply admire the Pope's great achievements in spreading the faith. Now, your representatives, following the consistent spirit of holiness and goodness, are opening an unprecedented conference."</p>
<p>Public Progress Conference Issues Declaration: After the closing of the Catholic Action Association Conference, a declaration was specially issued yesterday. The full text reads: "The Catholic Church in our country has a history of several hundred years, but there are only three million followers. The reason for this is that there is a lack of both local and foreign missionaries. The Bible says, 'The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few,' which is especially true in our country today. In his August 1st telegram, Pope Pius XI 'specifically instructed the bishops of China to begin organizing and developing all Catholic works in order to complete their missionary work, so that Catholic men and women, especially the beloved youth, may contribute to the peace, prosperity, and development of the motherland through their prayers and good words and deeds.' Thus, our Chinese Catholic Action Association was born in response to the times, with the purpose of assisting the Apostolic Delegate and the bishops and priests of various districts in carrying out the great work of Catholicizing China. Now, the formal establishment of Public Progress Associations in various parts of the country is becoming increasingly common. In order to increase the efficiency of all work, it is imperative to expand and tighten its organization. At the same time, the training of members must be thorough, their spiritual lives must be enriched, and all aspects of their work must be intensified and rationalized. Furthermore, in order to gather wisdom and benefit from collective thinking, we are convening this National Representative Conference. Approximately 200 representatives from various regions are attending, in Shanghai, the largest city in our country, under the supervision and guidance of the Apostolic Delegate and the heads of various districts, to discuss all important issues as a basis for future work. At the opening and closing ceremonies, we received encouragement from central and local officials. The Association is filled with gratitude and will strive to live up to the expectations of the Church and government leaders. The conference lasted eight days, from September 8th to the 15th of this year, and proceeded smoothly. As the conference is about to conclude, looking around the country and gazing into the future, there are things that must be told to the people of the country. We respectfully and sincerely state the Association's position and present the Association's aspirations, hoping to gain the understanding and sympathy of the people of the country. Regarding the Association itself, the activities of Public Progress, being of a group nature, must be organized, strengthened, and made universal. To make it universal, there must be departments for men, women, and youth in cities, towns, and even villages. To make it strong, there must be a clear system linking the national guidance committee to the diocesan guidance committee, and then to the various branches, with mutual connections. In addition, attention should be paid to the collection of Public Progress funds to ensure the smooth progress of the Association's affairs. Only in this way can the foundation be solid, and we can move forward in unison. This is the first point. Moreover, the soundness of a group depends on the soundness of its members. Members of Public Progress must thoroughly understand the broad and profound doctrines of Catholicism, understand the current environment of the country and society, and fill their personal and social lives with a supernatural spirit in order to achieve the dual goals of personal cultivation and benefiting all under heaven. This is the second point. The future work of the Public Progress Association can also be summarized. First, the Association's missionary methods must be innovated in many ways to adapt to the psychology of modern people and the needs of modern society. For example, the press, radio, and film are all good tools that we cannot ignore. Second, education is the foundation of a nation. The Association firmly believes that education containing the Catholic spirit is a factor in raising national morality and revitalizing national strength. The Association should assist the government in promoting children's education, youth education, women's education, and mass education, especially the literacy movement to reduce illiteracy. Third, culture is the lifeline of a people, and its decline should be prevented. For example, the absurdity and decadence of the domestic publishing industry in recent times has hidden the crisis of national subjugation and racial extinction. Purification and cleansing are our responsibility, and introducing the international and progressive Catholic culture to cure the nation's chronic diseases can make a difference. Fourth, charitable undertakings have always been a traditional undertaking of our Catholic Church. In recent years, Catholic medical undertakings, childcare undertakings, and other relief undertakings such as homes for the disabled and nursing homes in China have made considerable progress. This is all an expression of the Catholic spirit of benevolence. What should be striven for in the future is the rational distribution and balanced development of these undertakings. Finally, at a time when the economy is declining, our country's rural areas are bankrupt, and disasters are frequent, the Association should assist the government and work with other social groups to revitalize the rural economy, expand the cooperative movement, and carry out other rescue and drowning prevention efforts. The above points are all the goals that the Association will strive for in the future. Without the help of God, it would be impossible to achieve complete success, and the understanding and sympathy of the people of the country are also the driving force for its promotion. Therefore, the Association sincerely appeals and deeply hopes that all the elders, brothers, sisters, and siblings of the country will provide practical guidance and assistance so that the Association's capabilities can have the opportunity to develop in large measure and make greater contributions to the future of the country and society. Catholicism is fortunate, and China is fortunate."</p>

<h3>Huang Xinyao Forced to Confess and Accuse: Forgery Document Verdict: Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment Suspended for Two Years</h3>
<p>Huang Xinyao, the second son of the late Huang Fanjiu, the founder of the Yecheng Company, Riyue Bank, and Great World, conspired with lawyer Mi Jingshen and Mi's clerk, Wu Jiajin, to defraud his father-in-law, Zhou Songji, by forging a store receipt stating that Huang's property was being kept in custody and that after the matter was settled, Xinyao's (i.e., Huang Xinyao's) share of 100,000 taels should be handed over to him for self-management. After failing to reach a mediation agreement with the Shanghai District Court, Wang Shaozeng, a creditor of the Gongfa Company, obtained a photograph of this receipt and filed a complaint with the Special Second Court, accusing Huang Xinyao and Zhou Songqing, father-in-law and son-in-law, of damaging creditor rights. After the Criminal Court issued a warrant and detained Huang, he opened a safe deposit box at the Guohua Bank and took out the original receipt. Zhou Songqing then filed a complaint with the French Concession police, accusing Huang Xinyao of forgery. The Criminal Court's self-accusation case of damaging creditor rights was suspended. Meanwhile, the police interrogated Huang and identified Mi and Wu as accomplices and confirmed that the receipt was not in Zhou's handwriting but was forged by Huang and others. However, Mi and Wu had already left Shanghai, and the police only sent Huang to the Special Second Court to file a public prosecution. After repeated hearings and debates by Judge Li Changnian, a final verdict was announced. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. At around 9 a.m., Judge Li arrived at Criminal Court One and ordered the defendant to be brought to court. Huang Xinyao was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, suspended for two years, for using a forged private document. The forged receipt and the appraisal photograph were attached to the file. After the verdict was announced, Huang was ordered to be returned to the detention center to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Qitai Zhiji Cloth Shop Embezzlement Case Continued Trial: Court Orders Account Books to Be Sent to the Police, with Joint Examination by Both Parties</h3>
<p>Feng Bowen, the accountant of the Qitai Zhiji Cloth Shop on Nanjing Road, was sued for embezzlement. The police detained him and handed him over to the Special District Court, which ordered him to be released on bail pending trial. This was previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng continued the hearing. First, the police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated the progress of the accounting investigation, saying that on July 13th of the previous year, there was a sum of 200 yuan that was not entered into the accounts. On July 22nd of this year, "there should have been 338 yuan of cash in the accounts, but it could not be found." The defendant also left the shop on this day. In addition, eight account books were missing. The defendant admitted to using over 3,000 yuan, claiming that this was a bad debt and not embezzlement. However, even if it was a bad debt, it should have been recorded in the account books. It is still necessary for an accountant to thoroughly audit the accounts, and a further extension of time is requested. Wu Linkun, the defense lawyer for the defendant Feng Bowen, claimed that the defendant also had a half share of the shop's rights. If the plaintiff, Ni Zhihao, had embezzled, the police should also investigate him. Ni had previously misappropriated over 100,000 yuan of the shop's money. All of this is based on evidence. Initially, because Ni was the manager and the defendant was the accountant, the defendant kept it hidden. After the previous hearing, it was agreed to examine the accounts at the police station at 3 p.m. last Saturday. However, Ni did not hand over the account books and said that he had handed over the accounts to an accountant for review and did not want to send them to the police station for investigation. This is exactly the same as when Mr. Qin Runqing mediated and asked him to hand over the accounts, but he broke his word. The shop's operations over the years had originally made a profit of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Now, because Ni embezzled 130,000 to 140,000 yuan, it is now in debt of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Ni, in order to facilitate the denial of responsibility to creditors, filed this lawsuit against Feng Bowen. Now, in order to thoroughly understand the situation, he fully agrees with the police's request to extend the time for investigating the accounts, and he requests that the court appoint an accountant or have one jointly hired by both parties to conduct the audit. He also requests that the plaintiff be ordered to send the account books to the police station. If the plaintiff alone hires an accountant, it is difficult to avoid bias. Subsequently, Detective Su Changsheng reported that the two parties had agreed to examine the accounts at the police station last Saturday, but Ni Zhihao and his lawyer and accountant did not attend, and the account books were not handed over. Judge Feng then adjourned the case to September 27th for further hearing and instructed the plaintiff's agent lawyer to convey to the party concerned that the purchase books should be sent to the police station for joint examination by both parties.</p>
<h3>Bindu Bank Theft: Worth 63,000 Yuan</h3>

<h3>Kidnapping of Elementary School Student Sun Shancheng: Kidnappers Brought to Shanghai from Hangzhou: Wang Baocai Brought Back to the Police Station</h3>
<p>The family of Sun Cailing, the current manager of the Hankou Nonggong Bank, resides at No. 50 Changxing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Sun's young son, Shancheng, is nine years old and studies at a nearby school. On the afternoon of the 5th of last month, at 1 p.m., Shancheng finished his meal and went to school accompanied by the maid, Shi Xushi, when he was kidnapped by bandits. A letter demanding a ransom of 500,000 yuan was sent, and the police were notified to investigate the case. The French Concession police have now discovered that the kidnappers were hiding in Hangzhou. They immediately dispatched detectives to Hangzhou, who, together with the local police, arrested the kidnapper, Wang Baocai.

<h3>Nanjing Shuntai Timber Firm Accountant Comes to Shanghai to Commit Suicide: Received Cash but Did Not Enter it into the Accounts: There Was Another Reason for This Suicide</h3>
<p>Lu Yuting, also known as Lu Lizhong, from Ningbo, 37 years old, was working as an accountant in the Shuntai Timber Firm on Zhongzheng Road, Nanjing. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, the timber firm's manager, Li Jinhui, asked Lu to settle the accounts. After Lu received the order, he suddenly left without saying goodbye. He took a car to Shanghai at night and stayed temporarily at the Shanghai branch of the Shuntai Timber Firm at No. 990 Changan Road, Zhabei. The next day, he secretly swallowed sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide. He was discovered and rushed to the Baohang Hospital. Fortunately, he was treated early and survived. The branch then telegraphed the Nanjing headquarters. After receiving the telegram, Manager Li Jinhui, suspecting that Lu wanted to kill himself because of embezzlement, began investigating the accounts. He discovered that Lu Yuting had embezzled 701 yuan and 5 jiao and 8 fen. He sent a representative with the account books to Shanghai and entrusted lawyer Wu Peng to report to the Xinwen police. Yesterday morning, he ordered Chinese and Western detectives to go to the Baohang Hospital, take Lu Yuting out, and send him to the First Special Court to request detention. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin's statement above, he asked whether the case could be accepted by the court or transferred to the Shanghai District Court for trial for convenience. Subsequently, the representative lawyer Lang Peng of the Shuntai Timber Firm stated that the person being petitioned in this case, Lu Yuting, was an accountant at the Shuntai Timber Firm in Nanjing. The method of his embezzlement was that after selling the goods and issuing invoices, he received the cash in succession, spent it himself, and did not enter it into the accounts. Now, all the evidence and account books have been brought, so he requested acceptance. When questioned, Lu Yuting confessed that he had used the account money because of gambling losses, but only 400 or 500 yuan. As for my suicide this time, there was another reason. The Nanjing branch was short of 60,000 feet of ocean pine boards, worth over 4,000 yuan. The manager falsely accused me of stealing them and selling the money for my own use. It was really unjust, so I committed suicide in anger. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confession and instructed that Lu Yuting be allowed to be detained for two days pending further decision.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Announces Results of First Literacy School: 66.3% of Adults Passed, 39.3% of Children Passed</h3>

The second phase of more than 220 schools began simultaneously on the 5th of this month. Yesterday, it was learned that the examination results of the first phase of students have been fully reviewed. It is estimated that the passing rate of adult classes is 66.3% of the examinees, and the passing rate of students is 46.2% of the enrolled students. The passing rate of children's classes is 39.3% of the examinees, and the passing rate of students is 29.1% of the enrolled students.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Simplified Characters in the Literacy Movement (Part 1) - Lei Zhen's Speech on Central Broadcasting Station on September 14</h3>
<p>The Literacy Movement Preparatory Committee invited me to say a few words. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the issue of simplified characters, which is closely related to the literacy movement. The Ministry of Education is currently working on promoting this issue, and there have been many reports in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem of China's backwardness, which prevents us from standing shoulder to shoulder with others, is the vast difference in knowledge. Knowledge is the foundation of all endeavors. We are always muddleheaded and do not seek knowledge, so it is naturally difficult to compete with others. We do not need to talk about European and American civilized countries for universal education, even backward countries like Siam can do it. 99% of the people in Europe, America, and Japan can read and write. Our country is so vast, and customs and languages vary from place to place. If we do not start with education urgently, how can we maintain national consciousness and build a new China? Therefore, universal education is a matter of utmost urgency, and the preliminary work of universal education is the issue of literacy. Our country has such a large population, and although there are no accurate statistics on illiteracy, it is estimated to be around 70%. The majority of the people in the country are illiterate, which is a very dangerous thing. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Central Government has stipulated literacy as one of the seven movements for party members. Those in charge of education believe that the basic work of implementing compulsory education is to enable the masses, especially school-age children, to read and write. To make this literacy work effective and easy to succeed, we must consider the tools for promoting this work, and this tool needs to be improved. Some advocate using phonetic symbols, and some advocate using simplified characters, but these two issues should be given equal importance. Phonetic symbols can only focus on the problem of pronunciation and reading, while simplified characters also consider the problem of writing. Just look at the popular novels and rural bills that generally use simplified characters for recording, which shows that simplified characters meet the needs of the general public.</p>
<p>The original function of writing is to convey thoughts, communicate feelings with each other, and record historical facts. It is just a symbol representing language, so it must be simple and easy to understand in order to expand its function. In modern times, things have become more complex, and all human living tools are undergoing reforms with each passing day, seeking the greatest efficiency with the most economical methods. Therefore, the reform of writing has gradually shifted from complex and difficult to simple and convenient. The principles of writing changes in various foreign countries are the same, aiming to make it easy to remember and easy to write, so that it is suitable for the needs of human life. Now, let's give another example. Turkey used Arabic characters for six hundred years, but Arabic characters are inconsistent with the Turkish language, so it takes at least five to six years for Turks to learn to write and read. It is difficult to find one literate person among ten. Kemal deeply felt that this was the biggest obstacle to universal education, so he resolutely ordered the abolition of Arabic script from January 1, 1929, and the adoption of Roman script suitable for national conditions. All official and private documents and books for six hundred years were replaced with new characters. Kemal himself held chalk and went to various places to promote the literacy movement. As a result, more than one million people learned in just a few weeks. To this day, the entire country of Turkey, both public and private, praises its convenience. This unprecedented cultural revolution relies heavily on the help of this writing reform.</p>
<p>In order to implement compulsory education and promote social education, the Ministry of Education initially proposed to improve the writing system. After the proposal by the former National Language Preparatory Committee, it was proposed to collect existing and relatively applicable simplified characters and compile them into a simplified character set for educational needs. Experts in writing research, such as Qian Xuantong, Li Shaoxi, and Wang Yilei, also enthusiastically researched and promoted it. Last year, Chairman Chiang, because of the importance of education in the bandit areas, deeply felt that implementation was not easy, and entrusted the Ministry of Education to discuss and promote simplified characters. The Ministry of Education felt that this matter was very important and was unwilling to act rashly, so it specifically submitted this issue to the National Language Preparatory Committee for thorough deliberation. Everyone believed that the currently commonly used so-called "traditional characters" were complex and difficult to write, and it took time to write them, which was not suitable for modern needs. If we want to break down this cultural obstacle, it is necessary to improve it. Therefore, after repeated discussions and consultations with experts, it was felt that the promotion of simplified characters could not be delayed. As a result, three measures were formulated this year and submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval and forwarded to the Central Political Conference for record. This is the process of the principles of simplified characters. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Hunan Education Director Zhu Jingnong Arrives in Shanghai to Handle the Funeral of His Late Mother</h3>
<p>Hunan Education Director Zhu Jingnong recently accompanied the coffin of his late mother from Hunan, changed to the Shashi steamer in Hankou, and arrived in Shanghai at 11 AM yesterday. Zhu was deeply saddened by the death of his late mother in Hunan, and was almost sick with grief. He had repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Education to resign, but was always persuaded to stay. In desperation, Zhu requested a leave of absence for two months to handle the funeral. Due to the busy affairs of the Hunan Education Department, Zhu cannot stay in Shanghai for long. After the funeral of his late mother is completed, he will return to Hunan to resume his duties.</p>
<h3>The Glory of China's Art World</h3>
<p>The 22nd Science Exhibition in Japan opened at the Ueno Art Museum on the 3rd of this month. Only 14 sculptors from all over Japan were selected, and Mr. Jin Xuecheng, a Chinese student studying abroad, was ranked first. Three of his works were selected. The Science Art Exhibition is the predecessor of the Japan Imperial Exhibition, and is an important part of the art world led by Tsuguharu Foujita and others. The examination of exhibits is extremely strict. Now, Mr. Jin's work has been selected as the chief, which is not only an honor for the art world, but also a great honor for the country.</p>
<h3>Second Group of Students Going to the United States Telegraphs Arrival in Chicago; Has Changed Trains to Go to School Separately</h3>
<p>The second group of more than 90 students going to the United States sailed from Shanghai on the Russian Empress on the 25th of last month, as reported in the previous newspapers. It is now learned that the student group telegraphed Zhu Shaoping of the Global Student Association in this city yesterday, saying that they arrived safely in Chicago on the 15th. After landing in Chicago, they need to change trains to go to school separately. All the students are very comfortable along the way. When they landed in Seattle, because the Global Student Association had made proper arrangements in advance, there were not only no difficulties, but also various special treatments. Wang Xiaofan also received a similar telegram from his daughter Lianqing from Chicago.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Bans the Wulun Women's Vocational School and Sends a Letter to the French Municipal Council Ordering It to Be Banned</h3>
<p>The privately established Wulun Women's Vocational School at 155 Avenue Lafayette in the French Concession is poorly run, has no facilities, and the qualifications of the teachers are lacking. The teaching and management are illegal. The Municipal Education Bureau has repeatedly sent personnel to investigate and found that the facts are true. It has ordered the school to close down quickly and has sent a letter to the French Municipal Council ordering it to be banned to avoid harming society.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Catholic Women's University to Be Established; Public Progress Association Enthusiastically Preparing; Enrollment May Begin Next Year</h3>
<p>The Chinese Catholic Public Progress Association's National Conference of Electoral District Representatives closed yesterday. The conference resolved to establish a women's university in Shanghai for the purpose of developing Catholic higher education for women. According to the New Sound News reporter's inquiry to the association, the president Lu Bohong and the supervisor Dr. Yu Bin are responsible for preparing for the establishment of the women's university. The funds will be raised by the Public Progress Association from people inside and outside the church who are enthusiastic about education, and efforts will be made to realize it next year and begin enrollment.</p>
<h3>"Economic Common Sense" Sales Are Growing</h3>
<p>Since the publication of "Economic Common Sense" edited by Mr. Yang Yinpu in the Economic News of the News in this year, it has been extremely welcomed by all circles.

The second volume has been reprinted and published, and the third edition of the first volume has also begun to be sold. The actual price is one silver dollar per volume, which is sold by the News and Life Bookstore. If you need to order by mail, you can send it to the Economic Bookstore at No. 6, Lane 298, Luban Road, Shanghai, with an additional postage of 13 cents. It is also heard that the third volume is also in printing.</p>
<h3>Little Men (48)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Before he could say anything more, the audience was as if struck by lightning, because they only saw Donny somersaulting backwards in the air three times in a row, and walking a short distance on his hands, head down and feet up. This elicited cheers from Windham, and Tommy joined the others in shouting praises. After this extraordinary acrobat regained his upright position, he looked at them with a calm arrogance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Windham asked him humbly, "Do you think I can learn to do what you do, but still not suffer too much?" Tommy asked while holding his elbow, because both of his elbows were still hurting after the last somersault.</p>
<p>Donny asked in return, "If I teach you, what will you give me?"</p>
<p>"My new folding knife: there are five small knives in it, only one of them is broken."</p>
<p>"Then I'll teach you now."</p>
<p>Tommy passed it over, looking at its smooth handle with a lingering fondness. Donny looked at it carefully, then put it in his pocket and walked away, saying in a flash,</p>
<p>"Just keep practicing until you learn it, there's no other way."</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Drunken Woodcutter)</p>
<p>A branch of bright red wax candle is placed aside, unused. Instead, it is gradually eaten by mice, leaving only a thin and long skeletal remains. How regrettable! If we light it with fire, although it cannot be as dazzling as an electric candle, it can still emit a ray of light in the darkness! Furthermore, let us turn to the topic of us being people in society, unable to be controlled by time, chipping away at our lives day by day until death. In short, on our journey, even if we cannot be earth-shattering and famous figures, we must still fulfill a citizen's duty: just like a wax candle, though small, can emit a ray of light in the darkness! On the contrary, a life, like a wax candle, being eaten by mice for nothing, is inevitably a waste of useful things, and is despised by the world!</p>
<p>The foundation of Nanjing Road is abnormally low due to the weight of the buildings. After the heavy rain a few days ago, the water was ankle-deep. From this, I thought of the people on the starvation line. Whose shoulders are not burdened with the heavy burden of supporting a family, and in this year of economic downturn, they naturally hunch their backs and moan without illness. Low-lying land accumulates water. As long as the ditches are made to flow smoothly, without being clogged, there will be no worry of water accumulation. Although society is full of twilight, starting from revitalizing industry, blocking leaks, and rescuing unemployed masses, everyone will be full, "Heave-ho!" "Heave-ho!" Carrying the burden, how energetic and powerful! In this way, perhaps the country and society will have a day of revival!</p>
<h3>Telephone Examination</h3>
<p>— Ji'an</p>
<p>People who live in the city, probably everyone needs to use the telephone, right? Especially since the recent issue of military telephone price increases, this telephone, which holds the news of urban communication, has become a topic of discussion and attention for the public.</p>
<p>But the telephone, when was it installed in Shanghai? What is its evolution? This is something we should know.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu Yuzhi's Shanghai Miscellaneous Records: The telephone in Shanghai was only established in the sixth year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty, that is, in 1881 AD, when the De Li Feng Company was founded. The inventor was Mr. Pixi (this is a foreigner, belonging to which country is no longer verifiable). Since then, the China Merchants Bureau installed telephones for bureau use in the eighth year of Guangxu, that is, in 1878 AD, to communicate with various offices and docks. From then on, the business community gradually installed telephones, which became an indispensable tool in commerce.</p>
<p>From this record, it can be seen that the telephone in Shanghai has had a history of more than fifty years. And the current telephone is installed more advanced, which is really the gospel of mankind. This is written as a telephone examination to inform those who do not know the history of the telephone in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Countess Working as a Model</h3>
<p>— Gong</p>
<p>There is a Countess in Paris, France. Recently, due to the death of her husband, in order to maintain her livelihood, she changed her name to Betty and worked as a model in the Chabaran fashion company.</p>
<p>This Miss Betty is born as beautiful as a flower and as jade. Golden hair, smooth skin, and azure eyes are a typical Swiss beauty. She studied at Gutenberg in her early years, and is proficient in English and French. She has traveled to many places, and almost everywhere in Europe has her presence.</p>
<p>Last year, she went to Paris and married a French Count. Unfortunately, after a year of happy married life, this Count died of illness. All that he left behind was an empty title, with no property. Betty lived alone in Paris. For the sake of livelihood, she soon became a model.</p>
<p>One day, a reporter from a certain newspaper went to visit her, and she made the following statement:</p>
<p>"Since my husband died, I have had nothing to live on. I don't have a penny. I love to wear beautiful clothes, so I decided to go to a fashion company to be a model. Although I had no experience in this profession in the past, I had to take a risk and try it."</p>
<p>"At first, I often blushed," she herself admitted, "but now I am calm about it. Although people stare at me without blinking, like hungry eagles, I don't care at all. This kind of life is also happy, because I am very satisfied with what I eat and wear, and the income is not bad. If a woman in France does not have special living skills, this profession is the best. I don't want to end my life as a model. I want to learn some knowledge about the clothing industry. And I hope to stand out one day, and then do something that will not lose my personality."</p>
<p>"My biggest dream is to hope that I will go to America in the future and live there," she said finally.</p>
<p>After six months of modeling, Betty's name is already known to everyone in Paris. Everyone thinks that she is the best model in Paris, especially because her skills and postures when performing in evening gowns are the most fascinating.</p>
<p>Betty's figure is just right, neither tall nor short. The face is slightly thin and oval. The nose is small and pointed, and when smiling, she is shy and reveals her pearly teeth. She doesn't like to use artificial makeup excessively, and she is already charming with just a little powder.</p>
<p>Betty's daily life is also very simple. She eats fruit dew and vegetables, and doesn't eat much meat. In her spare time, she likes sports and movies, but she doesn't hope to be a movie star. She has no intention of remarrying at the moment.</p>

<p>Episode 19: Experienced Staff Good at Knocking on Doors; New Love Keeps One Away from Visiting Sick Relatives</p>
<p>As for those two people who squeezed up the stairs, that was nothing surprising. Didn't you see me shouting loudly at them from upstairs? For now, it's over. I reckon they'd be too embarrassed to make another ruckus. But there's one thing: I'm afraid they'll send this news to the newspaper office. If it's published in the paper tomorrow, it'll tarnish the Commissioner's reputation. Qiu Zecheng saw him squeeze over for no reason, and knew he was just trying to curry favor by taking advantage of the situation. He was very unwilling to talk to him, and just glared at him. But when he mentioned the newspaper, he couldn't help being moved. So he asked, "How do you know about that?" Jie Fu looked downstairs, where the crowd hadn't dispersed yet. The accountants were gathered in a group of fourteen or fifteen people, talking. He lowered his voice and said, "It's definitely true. Why haven't the immortals scattered yet? I'll go down again and try to persuade them." As he said this, he slipped down the stairs. Seeing Jia Duocai standing by his door with a stern face, he went up to him and said with a low laugh, "Actually, a Commissioner isn't that important. Why are you putting on such a big show?" Jia Duocai said with a faint smile, "Luckily he kept his mouth shut and didn't say a word, otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to save face." Jie Fu laughed and said, "You go and rest, why bother getting angry? It's much better to spend time with your wife." Jia Duocai smiled. Jie Fu turned around and saw Zhou Yourong standing to the side with his hands behind his back, smiling faintly. So he changed his tone and spoke to him. He also said in a low voice, "Isn't this kind of Commissioner letting the Central Government down? Xi'an isn't a small town or county, he can't scare anyone." Zhou Yourong smiled and said, "He got off easy. He didn't run into any armed comrades today." Jie Fu made a few more perfunctory remarks and saw that Qiu Zecheng was still standing by the railing, so he went upstairs again. (317)</p>

<h3>Japanese Seaside Bathing</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>According to our country's customs, when summer arrives, adults and gentlemen all go to places like Qingdao and Lushan to escape the heat and enjoy their hot summer vacation. The customs in Japan are slightly different. In the summer, they either climb mountains or swim. There have been not a few cases of people encountering disaster while climbing mountains, but those who follow are still endless. The Japanese like to be active and will absolutely not live quietly in the mountains or by the sea all day long reading and taking walks, appreciating the natural scenery, as people in our country do.</p>
<p>Japan is surrounded by the ocean, and seaside bathing places are everywhere. As long as they are slightly tidied up and equipped, they can become very good swimming places. Moreover, rural life is inexpensive, without the noise of the city, so families of middle-class and above either go to the deep mountains or to the seaside. Transportation is convenient in Japan. All famous scenic spots and historical sites have cars and trains transporting tourists. Therefore, when summer arrives, the countryside along the coast suddenly becomes lively. The villagers also engage in various small businesses, selling local products or renting out rooms. In this short summer vacation, they can earn some money to supplement their household income. Therefore, they warmly welcome and entertain foreign tourists. There is an information office next to the train station, specially designed to solve the three major problems of food, lodging, and transportation for tourists, so that tourists do not feel the pain of being unfamiliar with the place. Business associations and municipal offices have organized consolation associations, personally visiting to thank the tourists, and listening to the shortcomings of the coastal equipment in order to improve them.</p>
<p>The popularity of swimming skills in Japan is also astonishing. Fifty-year-old women also wear swimsuits and take sea baths. Thirteen-year-old children are already taken by their parents to play on the beach. Most of our country's international students are not familiar with swimming, and all temporarily hire people to teach them. Usually, they cannot compete with their small children. No wonder our country is always behind in swimming at the Far East Games. Although the sea is as calm as a virgin, in the eyes of those who don't know how to swim, it is like a man-eating demon. Since the young composer Nie Er drowned, such unfortunate events have happened two or three more times, all because they were not familiar with swimming on weekdays. In Japan, there are forest schools and seaside schools in elementary school, so the Japanese have a considerable understanding of mountain climbing and swimming.</p>
<p>Except for women who wear swimsuits, men and children mostly only use a piece of black cloth tied around their crotches. This is a simple method that is not often seen in Europe and the United States. Our country's female compatriots originally didn't even dare to enter Japanese bathhouses, but now they actually bare their thighs and play with their boyfriends very naturally, and there is absolutely no sign of shyness. However, everyone feels that they are not as lively and plump as Japanese girls.</p>
<p>After soaking in the sea for a while, they go to the beach to sunbathe, and their skin gradually turns black. People who come to the beach for the first time have white skin and feel strange and out of place mixed among many black people. After the skin is exposed to the sun for a few days, it will turn red and painful, and they cannot sleep peacefully even at night. Later, it will slowly peel off and turn black, especially the two shoulders, where the skin peels off so terribly that it bleeds. Such tempering is like a blacksmith forging steel, so there is no reason why the body should not be strong and solid.</p>
<p>The only pastime when sunbathing is playing in the sand and picking up shells. Children pile sand and mud into various models such as mountains, castles, and tunnels. Sometimes they bury their whole body in the sand, leaving only their head exposed. Friends next to them pile sand into various nude statues. Japan is a country with widespread public health. Although there are not many flies, the mosquitoes in the countryside are no less than in our country, and they are absolutely not afraid of the smoke screen of mosquito incense. At night, tourists can't stand the mosquito attacks, so they have to go out for a walk to kill the dusk hours, and the coast becomes a place to cool off. Nearby businesses play wireless radio songs, and tourists surround a few lanterns and dance the Japanese dance. Sometimes, various stores unite and hire a group of geishas to dance on the beach, or screen comedies to entertain tourists. This can not only revitalize the night market, but also reduce the loneliness of tourists. Japanese businessmen always try their best to cater to the psychology of the public, so their business can develop.</p>
<p>There are not many seaside bathing places in our country, and there are few swimming pools in various places, so people in our country are very naive about swimming skills. However, swimming can make the muscles of the whole body develop evenly and increase the resistance of the skin. Sea bathing has even greater benefits. The reason why the physique of the Japanese people is stronger than that of our country is also an important reason.</p>
<h3>Records of Fragrant Clouds</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When I first heard these rumors, I wanted to do my best to refute them on her behalf, and tell the world the truth about her taking human milk. But after thinking about it again and again, I felt it was inappropriate. Because the habit of taking human milk is absolutely unusual, and people who hear it may be extra proud to make up all kinds of rumors. I remember the second morning after I entered the palace, when I saw her drink a cup of human milk, I really felt a little uneasy in my heart, and I actually thought that the Empress Dowager was a "old monster" who was good at harming people, and that her drinking human milk was like the demons drinking human blood, and that the wet nurse who squeezed the milk for her to drink would soon wither and die; but these terrifying guesses gradually disappeared later. In fact, in addition to this, there are many very special things in the palace. As long as you stay a little longer, you will naturally know that it is harmless to people, and you will be at peace with it; but when you first discover it, it is indeed going to make everyone feel strangely suspicious.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is that we have to ask whether taking human milk can really have the effect of preserving youth? In my opinion, it can, who dares to say it can't! Since a newborn baby can gradually grow up after taking human milk, it can be seen that human milk is indeed a rich source of nourishment; and if we look at infants who are breastfeeding, their skin color is always very white and moist, so it is very possible that human milk can make the complexion of an old woman in her twilight years turn white and moist again. So why should we have such unnecessary doubts when we see an old man taking human milk? Moreover, since this old man himself is convinced that human milk is enough to help her hold back the years that are passing by in great strides, then when she takes it, she will have a kind of belief in her mind, and her spirit will be more happy; we all know that when we take a kind of medicine that we have faith in, the effect is often extraordinarily fast, why is human milk not the same!

<h3>Storms Rapidly Gather in Italian and Argentine Financial Circles; Gold Market Also Sees a Sharp Drop; Central Government Exerts Utmost Effort to Open Cash Positions, and Only Then Does Stability Return; Briefly Reaches the 60-Dollar Threshold, Ultimately Falling 11 Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market declined sharply due to foreign banks contracting, but people's confidence was exhausted due to large investors selling competitively, leading to an increase in selling pressure. The central government exerted effort to open cash positions and slightly stabilize the market. However, the spot market was remarkably firm and repeatedly broke the 60-dollar threshold. In the morning, the overseas silver market saw British declines and American stability, with the Montreaux forward silver price falling by 3.8 to 6.5 percent. Exchange rates all increased. London raw gold fell by three pence. While off-exchange pre-market trading opened at 80 dollars, there were few buyers due to reports that the Italian-Argentine situation was worsening. Major investors such as Fuxing, Yongda, Dayong, Lifuyu, Huixiang, Hengyu, Lifeng, and Yuxinxiang all sold, immediately leading to a step-by-step decline. Dadecheng also reappeared in the market. The Central Bank's announced exchange rates saw British stability and American increases, with the customs gold unit falling by four percent. The standard marked gold price was posted at 921 dollars and 20 cents, causing the morning opening to be a low. After the opening, the market stabilized slightly. Unexpectedly, major investors competed to sell, immediately breaking the 70-dollar threshold. For a time, buyers were at a loss, selling pressure was overwhelming, and people's confidence was remarkably timid. Various rumors of the Italian-Argentine situation spread within the market, causing a fall of more than 10 dollars. Banks took advantage of the decline to close positions, and buyers became active at the low, making it easy to rebound. HSBC's announced exchange rates showed British increases of 1.25 and American increases of 3.125, but it was difficult to boost people's confidence. Banks also released some gold, and the domestic market strengthened, but then trended downward again. However, because the Central Bank opened up cash positions, firms such as Futaiheng repeatedly bought aggressively, causing repeated rebounds after a long struggle. Unfortunately, selling pressure remained high, and the exchange market remained loose, ultimately leading to a decline. Major investors continued to buy on the low, but with predictions of a five-anna increase in Indian silver, the market moved sideways at noon. The afternoon market opened stably. Banks sold enthusiastically, and the exchange market became even firmer. Major investors continued to sell bars and broke the 60-dollar threshold. However, buyers took advantage of the low to become active, and the market soon rebounded. The Hong Kong market continued to be firm, and banks sold even more enthusiastically. However, with the initial report of Indian silver rising only two annas, the market, although falling, hovered. Later, with Sassoon and banks blocking each other, the exchange market became even firmer and broke the 60-dollar threshold again. Unexpectedly, buyers were still eager, and the market was soon pulled up again. The second report of Indian silver was still an increase of two annas. The domestic market remained firm, but with people's confidence stabilizing, the market finally moved sideways at the end of the day. The day's trend was extremely difficult to be optimistic about.

The account price for this month was 857 dollars, October 861 dollars, November 864 dollars, the morning water supplement was 857 dollars, the afternoon water supplement was 854 dollars, based on the equal price of Chichi's standard gold, because the swap rate required a multi-party subsidy of three dollars, or about 873 dollars, and the spot market was strong and firm, because the central government vigorously opened up cash positions.

<h3>Extremely Rigid Foreign Exchange Process: Banks Initially Buying and Then Selling, Situation Quite Pessimistic</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's near-term and far-term rates both contracted to 1.875, while New York's silver market remained unchanged. Deferred silver in Montreux fell by 3.8 to 6.5 percent. London's raw gold fell by 3 pence. Sterling against the US dollar was at 9375, sterling against the French franc rose by 6 pounds sterling, the US dollar against sterling rose by 375, and the US dollar against the French franc rose by 25. The exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of sterling at 1 shilling 6 pence 375 and 4375 on offer, and the US dollar at 38 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, sterling tightened by 0.09375 while the US dollar was flat. After the opening, market sentiment turned bearish due to concerns about the Italian-Ethiopian war, and the market loosened. The Central Bank announced its official rates, sterling was flat while the US dollar rose by 0.0625. Customs gold units fell by 4 percent, further weakening market sentiment. Chinese merchants rushed to sell, causing the process to turn sharply downward. However, as banks took the opportunity to buy at low prices, there was still some tightening. The HSBC Bank announced its rates, sterling rose by 125 and the US dollar rose by 3125. Banks slightly sold out, and Chinese merchants' psychology remained difficult to rally, and turned to wavering. The Central Bank started buying spot, and thereafter market sentiment stabilized somewhat, and the process then presented a circling pattern. However, the market was more inclined to sell than to buy, and it was predicted that Indian silver would rise by 5 annas, and the situation was still loose. In the subsequent market, banks sold out one after another, continuing the loosening trend, but because the gold market was stable, Chinese merchants took the opportunity to buy low from time to time, and the initial report for Indian silver only rose by 2 annas, and was still circulating. The Hong Kong market continued to be loose and flooded, and banks' selling appetite became more intense. Sassoon continued to sell, so even though the secondary report for Indian silver still only rose by 2 annas, Chinese merchants maintained it repeatedly, but the process ultimately hardened. At the close, the near-term selling price of sterling was 1 shilling 6 pence 9375, and the US dollar was 39 yuan 125. Compared to last Saturday, sterling hardened by 4375, and the US dollar loosened by 1 yuan 0625. Chinese merchants first sold and then bought, and those who squeezed out about a shilling and bought US dollars were few. Here is a record of the day's transactions:</p>

As for the jiao coin market situation, it was still stable. Although Jiangnan small yang rose by 2 yuan 5 jiao in the morning, opening at 835 yuan 5 jiao, it recovered to 833 yuan at the afternoon close due to no transactions, so the result was no different from before. Transactions made were 4,000 jiao in the morning and none in the afternoon. Although Guangdong small yang rose by 4 yuan 5 jiao, reaching 755 yuan, it changed to a decrease of 4 yuan in the afternoon, to 751 yuan, so the result was only an increase of 5 jiao compared to before. Transactions made were 225,000 jiao in the morning and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon. The copper coin market has been increasing daily after the holiday, seemingly without end. Yesterday's market added another 1,500 wen, reaching 346,000 wen. The transaction amount was 44,980 strings of wen, equivalent to 13,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of notes at the city's Clearing House was 19,530,473 yuan 5 jiao 1 fen in silver dollars. The total amount of exchange was 5,990,063 yuan 3 jiao 4 fen in silver dollars, and the total amount of remittance was 5,925,431 yuan 9 jiao 1 fen in silver dollars. The total amount collected on behalf of the currency industry was 3,590,626 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen, and others were 4,024,351 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Securities: East African War Affects Bond Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was influenced by the increasingly critical situation in the Italian-Ethiopian conflict, with Britain also potentially drawn into the vortex. In addition, the unexpected closure of the Hong Kong National Bank raised concerns that the situation might escalate. Market sentiment was quite weak and vulnerable to shocks, leading to some selling or hedging. Given the rapid changes in this international dispute, there was no certainty. However, the market was heavily short, and some were taking advantage to exacerbate the situation. The market opened in the morning, and Nos. 4, 48, and 78 were actively selling. No. 4 also had offers to sell, and the northern bankers sold more than they bought. Although Nos. 16 and 72 had buying interest, the supply and demand on the trading floor remained far apart. This month's unified tax suffered the biggest drop of 7 jiao, and the rest also fell uniformly by 3, 5, or 6 jiao. In the second session, the trend stabilized somewhat as some bulls hedged their positions, and market prices saw both rises and falls, with a difference of about 5 or 6 jiao. The afternoon opening still showed weakness, with small continued declines of 2 or 3 jiao in the first group of contracts. After the 22nd level, the market showed some strength, and stopped falling, slightly recovering by 1 or 2 jiao. The closing saw some temporary short covering, and the clearances mostly recovered by 5 to 12 jiao. The market price results uniformly trended downward, by a small 1, 2, 3 jiao to 6 jiao. The total transaction volume was 12,890,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yunnan and Guangdong Purchase a Large Quantity of Cotton Yarn - Near-Term Yarn, Intended to Fall, Was Maintained</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation became increasingly dispersed. The market lacked any revitalizing spirit, and market sentiment was very depressed. Both bulls and bears found it difficult to start. As for current yarn sales, they were still not bad. Yunnan buyers were particularly strong, and Guangdong demand was also high, but it was still difficult to arouse the market's appetite.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Near-Term Firm, Far-Term Weak: At the opening of the standard yarn market in the morning, near-month prices trended down by several jiao due to weak foreign cotton. When auctioning far-month prices, they were slightly flat. The second and third sessions saw raw cotton firm due to unfavorable weather conditions. At the same time, current yarn sales to Yunnan and Guangdong were smooth, causing the sluggish and poor yarn market to gradually recover. The closing was particularly strong. As a result, each month's closing price rose by 1, 2, 3, or 4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, news of overseas cotton industries was still normal, but this month was still firm due to Japanese hedging. However, current yarn transactions were still able to be maintained, but it was still difficult to boost market sentiment. As a result, this month's price rose by 3 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and far-month prices fell by 3, 5, 6, or 7 jiao. Tongfu 350 bales, Tongji 300 bales, Heyu 600 bales, Gengfeng 300 bales, Yuan Yi 400 bales, Yicheng 550 bales, Runkang 350 bales, Dachang 650 bales, Dafeng 800 bales, Changfeng 1000 bales, bought Dafu 700 bales, Yu Da 900 bales, Daji 700 bales, Rui Da 550 bales, Changyu 400 bales, Shen Ji 550 bales, Tonghe 250 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Sales Very Smooth: Current yarn sales were still strong. Yunnan and Guangdong buyers in South China bought 2,400 bales, mostly 10-count yarn. According to statistics, all buyers throughout the day bought 2,946 bales, and the market was stable. The trade volume of each buyer is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 145, Wuhu 15, Guangdong 645</p>
<p>Yunnan 1,800, Changsha 100, Nanjing 7</p>
<p>Hankou 30, Xiamen 5, Ningbo 7</p>
<p>Jiujiang 3, Shantou 10</p>
<h3>All-Day Autumn Rain Causes Cotton Prices to Rise Sharply - US Cotton Falls, Market Sentiment Difficult to Recover</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and returned in the afternoon, but the overseas cotton market was still flat and weak, and standard gold also trended downward, which should have led to a decline. The reason was really that the local weather was bad, with drizzling rain. Currently, new cotton is being picked, and such rain damage will inevitably reduce the harvest. Therefore, new sellers are generally wary, so the situation is relatively quiet.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Rose Back by One Jiao: At the opening of the standard cotton market in the morning, prices trended up uniformly in all months. Sellers in the market decreased, and some floating buyers covered short positions, all because the weather was bad, rainfall was high, and it was unusually dark, so market sentiment turned firm and bullish. However, the overseas cotton market was still weak, and some were bearish. As a result, all months rose by 2 jiao half compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, the market suddenly turned soft again, but trading was not smooth, because today's US cotton still had a downward trend, and the market was mixed. In the end, all months fell by 2 jiao half to 1 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sold: Zhenda 1,300 loads, Tongji 1,400 dan, Hexing 1,500 dan, Yuan Yi 700 dan, Yicheng 1,600 dan, Dachang 1,100 dan, Yongda 1,700 dan, Changhe 2,200 dan, Changyu 2,200 dan, Renfeng 1,000 dan, Xiexing 800 dan. Bought: Yuan Yi 1,500 dan, Dafeng 1,300 dan, Renfeng 1,000 dan, Changfeng 1,300 dan, Shengyuan 1,600 dan, Xiexing 1,100 dan, Tonghe 1,900 dan, Xinheng 1,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,600 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Arrives in Large Quantities, Sales Stagnant: Current cotton consumption remains sluggish, and factories are not opening. The source is estimated to be Yaohua 3,219 bales.</p>
<p>Yaohua 28.00 Guangdong buyers advanced 200 bales for spot warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Yaohua 28.20 Miscellaneous buyers advanced 500 bales for spot warehouse delivery</p>
<h3>September Term Yarn Delivery Nears - Term Cotton Auction Suspended for One Month</h3>
<p>The city's Yarn and Cloth Exchange's September term standard yarn is scheduled to hold cotton yarn delivery on the 28th of this month. The cotton yarn trading for this month will be suspended on the 25th, 26th, and 27th. The market will be closed on the delivery date. September term standard cotton, due to the time when new and old crops are in transition, will suspend auction for this month, so there will be no delivery.</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Market Tense, Originally Also Due to the Thickening War Clouds in East Africa</h3>
<p>The flour market gradually increased in price in each month again. The prices of foreign wheat, Chicago wheat varied by a small 4 cents to 1 jiao, Canadian wheat nearly increased by 2 jiao, and foreign wheat decreased by a small 1 jiao. The initial market sentiment in this month had many floating short positions, decreasing by 1 fen half. However, auctioning to distant terms, many off-site bulls absorbed again, resulting in market sentiment repeating and vibrating. Each month also had increases of 1 and 2 fen. The transaction of each session also reached more than 400,000 packs. When opening in the afternoon, each of the near and distant terms rapidly increased again. There was a rumor that Italy and Ethiopia had contact, and the exchange rate also dropped due to this. Therefore, the inside and outside of the industry uniformly pulled in, and the momentum was severe. Compared to the morning, there was again an increase of 2 and 3 fen. This rise and fall is due to the shifting international situation. Reality and truth will go their separate ways. The comparison table is attached below.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market started flat and then increased frantically. Because foreign wheat quotations varied by a jiao, market sentiment was initially flat. The flour market then looked favorable, and buyers gradually became active. Therefore, each month increased by 3 to 5 fen. When opening in the afternoon, trading in this month turned scarce, and prices had little variation. Because foreign wheat was unable to be set, the market's sentiment in each of the distant terms was stable. In addition, the flour market continued to increase, and buyers were smooth. The prices were promising. As the international situation gets tighter, there are still concerns about special changes. In the current wheat market, because standards increased greatly, sellers were raising prices, and each grade called out prices with large increases of 3 to 5 fen. The price of Shandong wheat was 3 yuan 8 jiao 35 fen, the price of Shuikou wheat was 3 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen, and the price of Yao Wan Suqian wheat was 3 yuan 8 jiao, another 7 jiao 7 fen. The price of Dongtai Gaoyou wheat was 3 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen. Fuxin shipped 5,000 packs, Xinda shipped 2,500 packs, and Fufeng shipped 2,500 packs.</p>

<h3>Rice Slightly Rises Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the goods from each buyer still only arrived from the 12th and 13th (a total of 2,450 stones). The continuous rain caused the market's sentiment to increase. As the sales market in this street moved, the bags from Beiping's buyers also had more than 500 bags. The seller's asking prices were frequently higher. The prices of each item increased. As a result, each broken geng saw a higher price. Thin broken back started from 1 or 2 jiao. Each new geng also increased by 1 or 2 jiao. Fragrant geng also had a jiao. Luxuriant ocean new Chuanjian all presented the same beautiful scene.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the goods from each route of Hexia 16th and 17th, on the market, each item's outgoing goods were few due to the cloudy weather and non-stopping rain. Each store's market was sparse, resulting in retail sales being flat. Although Hexia's goods were opening up, few sales were made. The selling customer's hearts were strong. The market price of white broken geng was reduced by 1 jiao. Thin rice white yuan fixed price. The new Jiang Geng was slightly tight. The new Yang Tip group price tightened up to 1 jiao. The new customer tip price was expensive in the production area, resulting in the price increasing by 1 jiao. The other items had fixed prices.</p>

<h3>Talking About Fools</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>In our usual speech, when we laugh at someone for being too honest, or scold someone for being somewhat stupid, we often say that they are foolish and simple, and call them fools or idiots. According to dictionaries, the original meaning of the word "fool" is "light and clever," not to describe someone as ignorant or without knowledge. However, this word has long lost its original meaning. I think "傻" (shǎ) is read as "沙" (shā) with a rising tone. Describing a crude person as "沙塊" (shā kuài), or simply "沙" (shā), is a dialect from a certain time and place. Writing it out, it is not easy for everyone to understand, so later generations borrowed the word "傻" (shǎ) when writing, and it has been used for a long time. What exactly is the dialect of "沙" (shā) from that time and place? According to Song Jianglin's "Jizhizhi":</p>
<p>"The common people of the city call uncivilized people '沙塊' (shā kuài). The meaning is not yet known. Scholars and officials also often say it. Yongshu teased Changwen about the selection of virtuous men, 'Having sifted through sand and picked gold,' Wu was quite resentful of it. He shifted his anger to Yuanfu, saying, 'Someone is sandy in their heart, not sandy in their face. You are sandy in your face, but not sandy in your heart.' He became even more angry.</p>
<p>He also once joked about Zun, 'In the old days, he was sandy but did not whistle. Now, he whistles but is not sandy.'"</p>
<p>Approximately, scolding people as "沙" (shā) was already very popular in the Bianjing area during the Northern Song Dynasty. Therefore, people like Ouyang Yongshu, Wu Changwen, and Liu Yuanfu ridiculed each other as "沙" (shā). The meaning of "沙" (shā) and "哨" (shào, whistle) is the opposite, just like the meanings of "傻氣" (shǎ qì, foolishness) and "俏皮" (qiàopí, playfulness) are opposite in today's colloquial language. "沙塊" (shā kuài) refers to ordinary crude people. As for crude soldiers, at that time they were called "赤老" (chì lǎo). The same book also says:</p>
<p>"The vulgar customs of the capital regard soldiers as '赤老' (chì lǎo). The meaning is unknown. Did they get this name because of the size of the ledger? When Di Qing entered the Western Province from Yan'an, those who came to greet him did not arrive for several days. He asked a passerby, who did not know that it was Di's son. Since he said he had not arrived, he scolded him, saying, 'To welcome a '赤老' (chì lǎo), it takes several days to arrive.' Scholars therefore called him '赤樞' (chì shū). Boyong often joked about his Nirvana text, saying, 'It becomes even more distinct.' Di replied, saying, 'Do you not love it? I offer it as a line.' Wang Da was ashamed."</p>
<p>Even today, people in Shanghai often scold people as "赤老" (chì lǎo), just as people in Beijing like to scold people as "傻瓜" (shǎguā, fool). The Hunan dialect calls foolish people "塊老" (kuài lǎo), which may have evolved from "沙塊" (shā kuài); it also calls them "沙頭" (shā tóu), "沙氣" (shā qì), or simply "沙" (shā), but "沙" (shā) is read as "梭" (suō) with a falling tone. When writing, it is still written as "優" (yōu), but it is not known that it is a change from the first tone of the word "沙" (shā). Also, I remember that in Qu Yuan's "Nine Arguments" in the Chu Ci, there is the line "'塊　' (kuài shǒu)守此無澤兮，仰浮雲而永歎" ("Holding onto this barren land, I look up at the floating clouds and sigh eternally"). I suspect that the word "塊" (kuài) is a Chu word, a term of self-deprecation, just like later generations call themselves "愚" (yú, foolish). It is unknown whether "塊老" (kuài lǎo) was passed down from ancient Chu language.</p>
<p>People in Hunan also have a witty way of scolding people, calling them "五十三兩" (wǔshísān liǎng, fifty-three taels). This is because when silver ingots were used in the past, a large treasure (also known as yuanbao) was usually 53 taels. To scold someone for being very foolish is to call them "大寶" (dàbǎo, great treasure). Said indirectly, it's called "五十三兩" (wǔshísān liǎng, fifty-three taels). Sometimes they also scold people as "寶貝" (bǎobèi, treasure), or simply scold them as "寶" (bǎo, treasure). I think the word "賓" (bīn, guest) was originally written as "呆" (dāi, foolish). "呆" (dāi) sounds like "保" (bǎo, protect), an ancient character. "Dài Dài Lǐ" says, "The superiors' affection for their subordinates is like the heart and belly. Then the subordinates' affection for the superiors is like the fondness of "保子" (bǎo zǐ, infant) seeing his loving mother." A "保子" (bǎo zǐ, infant) is an ignorant child. Today, the Hunan dialect sometimes scolds fools as "包子" (bāozi, steamed bun). I think "包子" (bāozi, steamed bun) may be "保子" (bǎo zǐ, infant). Or it is said that "包子" (bāozi, steamed bun) is similar to "餛飩" (húntun, wonton). "餛飩" (húntun, wonton) sounds like "混沌" (hùndùn, chaos). To say that someone is "混沌" (hùndùn, chaos) by calling them "包子" (bāozi, steamed bun) is an indirect expression. Today, people read "呆" (dāi) as "獃" (dāi). Yuan Dynasty dramas have the phrase "呆打孩" (dāi dǎ hái, foolish child), using "呆" (dāi) as the idiot's "獃" (dāi), which shows that this has been the case for a long time. Also, "獃" (dāi) is sometimes read as "騃" (ái), and "痴獃" (chīdāi, idiotic) is also written as "痴騃" (chíái, idiotic).</p>
<p>In Hunan, people sometimes call idiotic or weak and bullied people "粲頭" (càn tóu), sometimes written as "孱頭" (càn tóu). The former meaning mocks them for being merely beautiful on the outside, while the latter meaning is like calling someone a weak scholar or a weakling. There is also a vulgar proverb that curses people: "老蟲 (老虎也) 交猪入的，又蠢又倔." ("An old worm (tiger) mating with a pig, both stupid and stubborn"). "倔" (juè) means stubborn, and "倔" (juè) is read as "拙" (zhuō, clumsy). Also, fat or clumsy people are called "笨公" (bèn gōng, clumsy old man). "Jin Shu" records that the Governor of Yuzhang, Shi Chou, considered greatly fat men as clumsy, and "笨公" (bèn gōng, clumsy old man) has the same meaning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in our hometown, we often call scholars "書憨子" (shū hānzi, bookish simpleton). Even non-scholars are sometimes called "憨子" (hānzi, simpleton), just like people in Shanghai call others "戇大" (zhuàng dà, foolishly big) or "戇頭" (zhuàng tóu, foolish head). Even if you are called a "書憨子" (shū hānzi, bookish simpleton), it is not a compliment, just like other places call "書獃子" (shū dāizi, bookworm). However, the words "憨子" (hānzi, simpleton) can sometimes replace the word "先生" (xiānsheng, teacher). For example, if you call Mr. Zhao, you can call him "趙憨子" (Zhào hānzi, Simple Zhao). Calling him this is not considered disrespectful, and the person being called is not angry. It is even more affectionate than calling him "先生" (xiānsheng, teacher). Ouyang Xiu's "Gui Tian Lu" says:</p>
<p>"During Emperor Taizong's reign, there was a court painter named Jia Xuan, who served the court with chess and was known as a national player. For decades, no one has succeeded him. Recently, there was a man named Li Hanzi, who was quite famous and said to be unrivaled in the world. However, this man's appearance was dim and turbid, and he was so dirty that he was unapproachable. He was just an ordinary person from the neighborhood and was not worthy of being placed on the table. Therefore, Hu Dan once said to people, 'If chess is easy to understand, then even someone as clever as Dan might not be able to do it. If it is difficult to understand, then foolish and lowly people often achieve perfection in it.' His words are indeed true!"</p>
<p>It can be seen that the title "憨子" (hānzi, simpleton) has been around for a long time, and it can also be known that "憨子" (hānzi, simpleton) is another name for the dim and foolish. The farmers in my hometown often ridicule ordinary "書憨子" (shū hānzi, bookish simpleton) as "破夜壺" (pò yèhú, broken chamber pot) or "桐油罐" (tóngyóu guàn, tung oil can), thinking that they are useless. If it is changed to empty classical Chinese, it would be saying "百無一用是書生" (bǎi wú yī yòng shì shūshēng, scholars are useless). Scholars are just considered waste!</p>
<h3>Records of What I Saw in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>We rested for half an hour, then the Daoist priest Dao Qi lit incense and candles in front of the Dragon King statue, placing two brand-new tin wine pots shaped like gourds. The county magistrate and the crowd praying for rain knelt before the Dragon King, kowtowing and bowing. The Daoist priest knelt on the left, holding two bamboo roots used for divination in his right hand. After kowtowing to the Dragon King, he said:</p>
<p>"It hasn't rained for a long time, and the people are very uneasy. Today, the county magistrate and his staff have come before you, old sir, to pray for rain. If you, old sir, can bring rain by noon, please grant us a 'sacred' divination."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he threw the bamboo divination sticks in his hand.</p>
<p>"A 'yang' divination," the farmers nearby said.</p>
<p>A 'yang' divination meant the Dragon King was rejecting the county magistrate's request. So the Daoist priest repeated the same words twice, throwing the bamboo sticks twice, but still did not receive a 'sacred' divination. The Daoist priest asked the county magistrate to burn yellow paper and then ask when water could be drawn. As a result, he divined that it would be allowed at the hour of the Rooster (酉時, 5-7 PM). The Daoist priest then took the two empty wine pots, tied red thread around the neck of each pot, walked to the bank of the Longluo River, and placed them upside down at the bottom of the water, securing the ends of the ropes on the shore. I asked:</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"At the hour of the Rooster, when the wine pots float up, water can be drawn," the Daoist priest replied.</p>
<p>How could empty wine pots sink to the bottom of the water? And how could wine pots at the bottom of the water float to the surface? In reality, the Daoist priest had already filled the wine pots with water when he put them in, and to retrieve them, he only needed to pull the ropes secured on the shore, and the pots would naturally be pulled up. The villagers were superstitious, but they thought it was the Dragon King's miracle!</p>
<p>It wasn't yet twelve o'clock, but the Dragon King had only granted permission to draw water at the hour of the Rooster. We had no choice but to wait at a farmer's house at the foot of the mountain, while sending someone to the town to fetch food to satisfy our hunger.</p>
<p>At five o'clock, the Daoist priest picked up the wine pots, filled them with water, and hung them from the tip of a tripod made of willow branches, covering them with another bunch of willow branches. Four farmers carried it, and we followed behind them back to the town, placing the two pots of Dragon Water on the altar of the City God. Then the Daoist priest muttered scriptures, lit incense, and offered them up.</p>
<p>The sky was empty, without a hint of rain. The old folks in the town wove a Willow Dragon, made of over a dozen young men, their faces painted red, each holding a willow branch. Shouting, they danced in the streets to the discordant sounds of gongs and drums. The shopkeepers poured ladles of water from large wooden buckets in front of their shops onto the dancing dragon men, soaking them from head to toe, as if they had fallen into boiling water.</p>
<p>I stood there blankly, thinking, can rain be obtained by praying if heaven does not send it? (The End)</p>
<h3>Brainpower and Physical Strength</h3>
<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>It is said that the great philosopher Plato, before meeting Socrates, was actually a broad-shouldered warrior, having won two championships in the Isthmian Games.</p>
<p>It is quite remarkable that such a wrestling warrior would transform into a philosopher.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it seems that warriors in wrestling and athletics are not thinkers. This statement is not likely to be too far from the truth in this world. From this, we can see that brainpower and physical strength (also representing the health and strength of the body) are not balanced and are mutually contradictory.</p>
<p>Athletes have extremely strong bodies and extraordinary strength, but they rarely have sharp minds - although there are exceptions, of course. Conversely, thinkers have minds adept at thinking, and thus possess methods of thought, research ability, and judgment, but their bodies are often weak. People with the smartest minds may have bodies that are surprisingly frail.</p>
<p>This is certainly not a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>A reasonable balance should be maintained between brainpower and physical strength so that the two are harmonized; this does not mean that athletes should also have the minds of thinkers, and thinkers should also have the bodies of athletes, but this is, of course, the highest ideal - allowing everyone to develop in a balanced way.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Road to Zhan Mountain</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Having been mired in the dirty city for two years, thinking back to my wanderings by lakes and seas in the past, it truly feels like another world. As the early autumn cools, watching people return from summer resorts, I cannot help but feel moved. Of course, in the past and even in the future, I have never had the fortune or leisure to escape to a summer resort, but because of my travels, I left my footprints in such places. For example, in Qingdao, the stay of over a month still remains in my memory.</p>
<p>I have already said that I did not go there to escape the summer heat. I arrived there after the Mid-Autumn Festival. That year, the autumn came early, and when I arrived, all the people escaping the summer heat had already left. Therefore, I did not see the lively and beautiful Qingdao. But I think there is no need for any regret. The sea is just as blue, the mountains just as green, and it does not put on a smile for the lonely traveler, or perhaps this lonely traveler can almost boast about monopolizing the beautiful scenery of the land. Saying monopolize is not an exaggeration. Not to mention the more remote places, even in the very orderly First Park, there were several times when I went for a walk and did not encounter a single tourist.</p>
<p>First Park has few people. In terms of the open space it occupies, it seems inferior to the racecourse in front of it, but the side leaning against the mountains is simply boundless, and the mountains are covered with lush trees, which is really not part of the park's boundary, but can still be regarded as equal to the park. Qingdao is also a windy area, but its foundation is ultimately built on commerce. The people who build villas in Qingdao are generally wealthy merchants. Their houses have always been built in relatively lively places. The mountains around the park are nice, but their eyes have not seen it yet. However, with the gradual development, there has also been some construction on the northern side of the park. Perhaps the situation has changed somewhat in the past two years. If the west side of Jing Shan Road is now full of houses, then standing on Jing Shan Road, looking over the park, looking over the racecourse, looking over the sea, and looking all the way to the distant islands in the sea, such a vast realm would not be easily enjoyed by tourists anymore.</p>
<p>Taking Jing Shan Road from the park, passing through Qingdao University to return to my residence, is the shortest and easiest route, and I often take this road. After becoming familiar with this road, I began to think about walking once along the mountain road around the four sides (?) of the park. The west end of Jing Shan Road can be said to be a crossroads. Going west leads to Qingdao University, going north passes through Qingdao Mountain behind the university, and going south is Fu Shan Road, which passes through the ridge of the small mountains on the west side of the park and the racecourse. I knew that the southern end of Fu Shan Road was Yu Shan Road, so the next day I walked from Yu Shan Road to Fu Shan Road.</p>
<p>Walking along Fu Shan Road, you can see the splendor of Qingdao. To the west, the mountains of Reservoir, Governor's Office, Signal Hill, and Observatory block out the actual hardships of Qingdao, and to the east and west, Zhan Mountain cuts off the desolation of the outer world. The people living here must be living beautiful dreams all day long. Among them, there are naturally some noble Chinese, but most are foreign expatriates. The native people knew about Qingdao too late, and it was too late to obtain the best locations, so they could not have the most beautiful dreams.</p>
<p>The western peak at the northernmost end of Fu Shan Road stands south of the mountain valley where Qingdao University is located, opposite Signal Hill to the west of the valley. Both of these peaks are the only bald peaks in Qingdao with almost no grass. Originally, the trees on all the mountains in Qingdao were cultivated artificially, and these two were probably deliberately left as original samples. Signal Hill was originally left for viewing, so naturally there was no need for trees. As for leaving this one in its original state, I don't know what the reason is, or perhaps it was for military needs in the past, but now it is gradually becoming a residential area.</p>
<p>After walking to the end of Fu Shan Road and entering Jing Shan Road, because it was a familiar road, I deliberately walked on a smaller road. After a few turns, I found a cemetery. It turned out that while the living had not yet learned to enjoy this fine place, there were already homes for the dead here. At that time, I thought that the hope of living in Qingdao in this life was probably not likely to be realized. If I wanted to occupy a piece of land for a grave here, perhaps that was not too extravagant a hope. This fantasy was indeed a bit absurd, but in a realm that evokes otherworldly thoughts, the tendency of the mind towards extinction is not deeply worthy of being regarded as strange.</p>
<p>Turning from the small path between the mountain tombs back onto the main road, I reached the boundary between Jing Shan Road and Zhan Shan Road. On the left and right are mountain peaks about three hundred feet high. From between the peaks, you can see the distant plains and villages. Along the waist of the west peak, there is a main road that leads directly to that plain. I calculated that this road was behind Qingdao Mountain, so that village was probably the Tai Dong town at the northernmost part of Qingdao. If so, I wanted to change my original plan and go from here to Tai Dong town and then turn back. Just then, I saw someone walking towards me from that road, so I waited below. But the opposite answer I received from that person was that the village was fifteen li away, and Tai Dong town was more than ten li away from that, which was too far. And this person was going to Zhan Mountain Road, so I decided to walk with him.</p>
<p>The trees along the Zhan Mountain side grow particularly lush. The park has already been hidden in the forest, but from time to time, I can see grasslands, houses, and ponds through the gaps in the trees, which is quite interesting. About half a li away, the main road passes through a mountain branch. The road is cut through the mountain branch and passes through it. Both sides are about one person high. To the north of the mountain branch is the park, and to the south is a barren valley. The valley is full of grotesque rocks, with green moss on top, and you can vaguely see clear springs flowing between the rocks. At the foot of the mountain, there are many houses, but they are not modern buildings, but old-fashioned village residences. However, the robust building of the First Middle School stands nearby. Inside this middle school, you do not feel that its location is beautiful, but now looking down from the mountain, it is completely different.</p>
<p>The mountain road follows the mountainside south and gradually becomes a downhill slope. At the end of the high peak, another low peak stands in front, and two paths branch off, one probably leading to the side of the middle school, and the other leading out of Qingdao beyond the peak. The road is completely built by splitting the mountain, probably for the secrecy of marching troops, so it is not considered a great achievement. For tourists, this road is really unwelcome. When I got here, I climbed onto the outer section of the road and walked firmly on the embankment ridge. In this way, everything beyond Qingdao came into view. Of course, there are also some Western-style buildings scattered sparsely, but the overall impression is still a suburban wilderness. In the distance, there are still green mountains, but nearby is a quite open plain, with empty fields exposing yellow soil, and a strong wind raising dust all over the sky. However, looking at the distance, just looking at the rows of green mountains, you still do not notice the dryness of this northern air. The beautiful scenery is very similar to the view of the mountains of western Zhejiang from the avenue from Langdang Ridge to Wu Yun in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Zhan Mountain Avenue leads all the way to the sea. Not far from the sea, it intersects with the main road back to Qingdao. I can't remember the name of this road, and I never walked along this winding road. Whenever I encountered a fork, I would branch out, often walking up and only then realizing that it was a dead end, and having to walk back. But in the end, I finally walked along a newly opened road through the dense forest to the west of Huiquan Point. I was already tired, and I had already been to the Huiquan Point Battery, so I despondently returned to my residence. On the road south of the racecourse, looking back at the mountain road I had traveled, excluding the Fu Shan Road section, I had passed through five mountain peaks. It can be said to be a great national forest. I felt that the hardship of this day's journey was worth it.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I recall Qingdao, this day on the road to Zhan Mountain is always the first thing I remember.</p>
<h3>Dormitory</h3>
<p>— By J. Joyce, Translated by Li Bo</p>
<p>Mrs. Mooney was a butcher's daughter. She was a very reserved woman: a resolute woman. She married her father's foreman and opened a butcher shop near Spring Garden. But after her father-in-law died, Mr. Mooney began to be debauched. He drank, embezzled capital, and accumulated debts. It was useless to ask him to swear off alcohol: after a few days, he would break his vow again. He ruined the business by fighting with his wife in front of customers and by buying bad meat. One night, he chased his wife with a butcher knife, and she had to sleep at her neighbor's house.</p>
<p>After that, they separated. She went to the judge, divorced him, and took care of the children. She did not give him money, food, or shelter: so he had to become a servant to a county magistrate. He was a tattered, hunchbacked little drunkard with a white face and white hands, and white eyebrows painted above his swollen red eyes: he sat in the servants' room all day, waiting to be called. Mrs. Mooney collected the remaining capital from the butcher shop business and opened a boarding house on Hardwicke Street. She was a dignified woman. Her dormitory had a shifting and uncertain group of lodgers, including wanderers from Liverpool and the Isle of Man, and occasionally actors from music halls. The long-term lodgers were minor clerks in the city. She managed the dormitory cleverly and steadily, knowing when to give credit, when to be strict, and when to be lax. All the long-term young men called her "Madam."</p>
<p>Mrs. Mooney's young lodgers paid her fifteen shillings a week for board (excluding beer and strong ale with dinner). They had the same interests and occupations, and for this reason, they were all very friendly. They discussed the winners and losers of the racetrack. Madam's son, Jack Mooney, was a clerk for a manager on Fleet Street, and he had a reputation for being difficult to control. He liked to use obscene language: often not returning home until dawn. When he met his friends, he always had many things to tell them. Indeed, he always knew something—that is, he knew a horse that neighed loudly or an artist who neighed loudly. He was also good at boxing and singing humorous songs. On Sunday nights, gatherings were often held in Mrs. Mooney's front parlor. Music hall performers often came to help out; Sheridan played waltzes and polkas, harmonizing and singing. Madam's daughter, Polly Mooney, also sang, she sang:</p>
<p>"I am a... naughty daughter,</p>
<p>Don't pretend:</p>
<p>You know me."</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>What Is the Use of a Permanent Director of the League of Nations?</h3>
<p>— Blow</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch on the 13th, China applied for a seat as a director on the League of Nations Administrative Council. The League of Nations Administrative Council secretly discussed China obtaining half a seat as a permanent director tonight, but no resolution was reached. This matter will likely not be brought up at this session of the League of Nations General Assembly, and will be delayed for at least another year. This matter seems to be disappointing.</p>
<p>But I don't understand what use it is to be a member state of the League of Nations? What use is it to be a director of the League of Nations Administrative Council? Therefore, it is not necessary to request to be a director of the League of Nations Administrative Council. It is even less necessary to request to be half a permanent director of the League of Nations Administrative Council, because being a member state of the League of Nations requires bearing a large expense for the League of Nations, and what is the result obtained? It is truly a pointless grievance.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the League of Nations organization? Which countries are the central figures manipulating the League of Nations? I will not ask about them for the moment, but since September 18th, what has been the effectiveness of the League of Nations? What is the authority that the League of Nations can exercise? Our country, as one of the member states of the League of Nations, has obtained what portion of the League of Nations' assistance? Let's leave this account aside for the time being. Isn't Abyssinia a member state of the League of Nations now? Isn't the League of Nations now using all its strength to help Abyssinia? But it's better not to help. One help simply makes things worse.</p>
<p>Please see! According to a London dispatch on the 8th, the League of Nations Administrative Council's five-nation group for handling the Italian-Abyssinian issue is currently considering implementing a protective system for Abyssinia, with Abyssinia returning to Italian protection. Furthermore, according to a Paris dispatch on the 13th, the five-nation committee will likely give Italy a new guarantee, allowing Italy to have economic and political advantages in Abyssinia. The method will be to adopt a mandate system. In this way, Abyssinia's economy and politics will be controlled by Italy, and Abyssinia's qualification as an independent country will be completely lost. And even with this method, Italy is not satisfied and has not accepted it.</p>
<p>From this point of view, what use is it to be a member state of the League of Nations? What harm is there in not being a member state of the League of Nations? If Abyssinia were not a member state of the League of Nations, at most, it would only be a lost country. Now that it is a member state of the League of Nations, it is still inevitable that it will be lost. Therefore, I say, let's save the expenses of being a member state of the League of Nations. Now that our country is applying to be half a permanent director of the League of Nations Administrative Council, I think it is completely unnecessary.</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom Mood</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>It is once again the plum rain season, making people feel mentally tired and moldy.</p>
<p>The plum rain firmly locks a row of emerald smoke on the branches of a plane tree in front of the small window. The branches and leaves, and a wandering heart, sway. I endlessly and yet seemingly intentionally recite that poem:</p>
<p>——When the plums are yellow, they splatter on your teeth, green banana leaves spread across the window screen: children do not yet understand how to contribute to plowing and weaving, but they also learn to plant melons next to the shade of the mulberry trees.</p>
<p>In my hometown, when the plums are yellow and the banana leaves are green, the sound of plowing water and the sound of weaving shuttles unfold the rural duet; the tune is high-pitched and clear, and a golden world is woven from that simple and unadorned melody.</p>
<p>I am a child who does not understand plowing and weaving. Because of my full-time responsibility for herding cattle for many years, it seems that my blood is mixed with the primitive nomadic wildness. Once I reach the mountain, I am like a fish leaping into the sea, running and howling all over the mountains and valleys. Next to the plum tree is the battlefield of our periodic war. Indeed, in the history of a shepherd boy's life, everyone firmly remembers the annual "Plum War"!</p>
<p>The plum tree trunk is not very tall, perhaps to protect and propagate its offspring, and is covered with thorns all over. The branches and leaves flash with a sun-shading umbrella shape, and clusters of golden plums are attached to the oily green leaves, like brilliant stars hanging upside down on the light blue sky. Ripe plums taste sweet and sour, and after eating them, the lips and tongue feel a numbness, but at that time, who knew that that was the true taste of life!</p>
<p>Due to geographical reasons, our group lived on the north side of a clear pool, while the shepherd boys on the south side, separated by only a pool of water, were naturally our enemies. Although we did not have the genius to mark out the distinct banners of the Hubei and Hunan factions, the Hunan faction people would never want to escape our siege if they came to the north side. However, this kind of hatred was particularly acute only when the plums were yellow. When time passed and circumstances changed, we would be reconciled as before.</p>
<p>Among this group, I had a relatively tall body and extraordinary wildness, so I was pushed to be the leader of the Hubei faction. As usual, we would always have six or seven days to guard the plum tree</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>side, from morning till night, sometimes even not going home for lunch, guarding against the Jiangnan faction boys coming to steal them, until the plums were all rolling down our bellies, and only then could the martial law be lifted. Because the plum tree grows in the mountains, stones and branches are all weapons that are "taken to their fullest extent and used to their utmost". Regarding the replenishment and preparation of weapons, we had assigned several commissioners to be responsible. In advance, we gathered the stones together, using leaves to shield them from enemy eyes, and then cut down small, sturdy, and slender trees, shaving off the knots and scars and hiding them in the shade of the trees. In addition, there were knives, arrows, and hemp ropes, everything that was needed. Guarding, guarding, in longing eyes, watching the plums change from emerald green to light yellow, and then to golden yellow. Some, unable to bear the long days, would pick one or two to temporarily suppress their hunger, and the saliva, mixed with the sourness, would overflow in their mouths. That was how it tasted, in the young heart, that was the work worth doing.</p>
<p>The Jiangnan faction naturally coveted it ambitiously from the side, and sometimes one or two small thieving eyes would dart out from the jungle. With a roar from us, they would slip away into the jungle again. We seemed to be the owners of that row of plum trees.</p>
<p>One morning, when the morning dew had just settled, the clear and sunny sunlight revealed to us that it was the day of the plum harvest. Busily eating breakfast, we arrived in the mountains in unison. The people in front suddenly shouted loudly, because several Jiangnan faction boys wanted to sit back and enjoy the fruits of our labor by picking them from the tree. With a command from me, I made everyone run forward, but they were also prepared. The ambush troops under the shade of the trees all rushed out, and so the cries, the collision of wood and stones, and the flying and shooting, formed a bloody battle. At the end of the battle, I, as the leader, was injured, but we finally occupied the plums. Eating plums with scars, although there was supreme glory in my heart, the taste of the plums was still sweet and sour.</p>
<p>Whenever it is the plum rain season, it always makes me think of the annual "Plum War" and the taste of plums in my childhood. The seven or eight years of wandering life is also a plum taste. From this taste, I have trained my plum blossom mood. I think that the plum blossom mood is not just for me alone. If your soul is not willing to be a prisoner of your body.</p>
<p>I want this plum blossom mood to exist in the vast group of bodies!</p>
<h3>Lantern Festival</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Miss Sister saw a lantern festival once, in the penultimate year. That year, the rice stacked behind the house was used to bring joy to Miss Sister's father, who stroked Miss Sister's dark, oily hair and said: "You're a year older, good girl. I'll take you to the city to see the lantern festival on the fifteenth (Lantern Festival)."</p>
<p>Miss Sister was only five years old that year, and there were no siblings at home. At most, she could find scraps of cloth and sit on a small stool, imitating her mother, pretending to make clothes. Being told this by her father, Miss Sister became restless, twisting her mother's arm every day to ask how many days until the fifteenth.</p>
<p>On the fifteenth, Miss Sister forced her father to go to the city early in the morning. When told that the lantern festival wouldn't start until evening, the good girl said, "But I want to go to my aunt's house to play." Her aunt was married to the owner of a general store in the city.</p>
<p>This day, Miss Sister was as happy as her father when he saw the rice bin full of grain. Her aunt's house had a sister who was a year older than her. To attract customers, the general store had made many small lanterns. The two sisters each wanted a lantern, lighting candles during the day and running around the front hall and back rooms endlessly.</p>
<p>Her aunt's general store was on the main street, next to quite large shops in the city: Lao Da Fang, Decheng Silver Store, Dasheng Silk Brocade Bureau. Everyone competed with each other to create all kinds of strange and wonderful lanterns. When night fell, the lights were bright, and the bustling scene was something Miss Sister's father had never seen before. Usually, her father went to the city just as the sun was rising and returned home before sunset. He handled goods, choosing to rent and come to the city several times a year, but he had never seen the city at night—the city had gasoline lamps, electric lights, and the Lantern Festival was an annual grand occasion.</p>
<p>Her father let Miss Sister ride on his shoulders and squeezed in and out of the tide of people to see the lanterns of each house. The most wonderful lanterns were those of Dasheng Silk Brocade Bureau. The wall of people in front of the door almost reached the opposite street. Her father squeezed into the wall of people, his mouth wide open. Miss Sister was waving her hands and feet, wanting her father to squeeze to the very front so she could hit the old Taoist with the white beard. The old Taoist was dressed in white cotton with a white beard and white hair, holding a whisk in his hand, standing on top of a mountain. The whisk in his hand moved rhythmically, as if someone was pulling a thread from behind. On the other side was a young female performer, holding two knives, also dancing in the air, with a long line of shrimp soldiers and crab generals next to her, holding various weapons, confronting the old Taoist in a mock battle. The lantern display was called "The Flood Overflowing Jinshan Temple," a story from the Legend of the White Snake. It is said that Dasheng Silk Brocade Bureau was the first to invent lantern displays using electricity.</p>
<p>After Miss Sister saw the lantern festival and returned home, her aunt gave her a rabbit lantern. From then on, she stopped learning to make clothes from her mother. Day and night, lighting candles, she ran around in the field, almost making the wild children jealous. After a few days, the rabbit lantern was burned by sparks, and she cried, wanting her father to buy her another one. Her father said that there were no lanterns for sale now, and he would buy one in the city at next year's lantern festival. So Miss Sister looked forward to the new year every day, knowing that after the new year, the fifteenth would come soon.</p>
<p>The second year's Lantern Festival, although the city still had a lantern festival as usual, and the scene of "The Flood Overflowing Jinshan Temple" in front of Dasheng Silk Brocade Bureau was still surrounded by a dozen layers of people, Miss Sister did not go to the city! Her aunt's family had already moved back to the countryside at the end of the year, saying that there was no business in the city, the expenses were too high, and they brought back an old carp lantern, which they gave to Miss Sister. Her father frowned all day long, and even when he sacrificed to heaven on the first day of the new year, he was listless. Miss Sister should have been a year older, but her father didn't notice. Miss Sister secretly asked her mother if they would go to the city to see the lantern festival on the fifteenth, but her mother didn't answer. Miss Sister played with the broken carp lantern for a while.</p>
<p>This year, Miss Sister is seven years old. On the first day of the new year, she obediently looked at her father's face. Her father's face was as gloomy as a rainy day, without a trace of a smile. Her mother urged him several times before he put down his pipe and went to burn incense and sacrifice to heaven. He only kowtowed twice, which Miss Sister counted, while her father used to kowtow ten times. Her aunt came to chat with her mother, and the two of them started crying. Her father was drinking alone in the room. Miss Sister glanced at the broken carp lantern hanging in the corner of the wall, silently retreated to her small stool, and played with her scraps of cloth, although she was calculating in her heart that in fourteen days it would be the fifteenth again—the day for the lantern festival in the city.</p>
<h3>Autumn Moon at Stone Man Mountain</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>Stone Man Mountain is one of the eight scenic spots of Dongting Lake. It has famous scenic spots, historical sites, and... but although I was born and raised there, it is a pity that I left that lovely hometown when I was thirteen or fourteen years old. I have been drifting alone in this unfamiliar city for more than ten years, and I have never been back to see that Stone Man Mountain that had once passed through ten thousand years. That distant childhood dream only left a blurred shadow in my memory.</p>
<p>"Is my hometown well?" Now I cannot forget my hometown after ten years of separation, even in my dreams; therefore, the more I cannot go back, the more urgent my desire to return becomes. Thus, the memories and nostalgia have gradually accumulated in my heart. However, more than ten years of wandering and drifting life have also made my limbs weaker. Therefore, this year I asked the company for a three-month long vacation to return to the countryside to spend the summer; but the hometown after ten years is still somewhat different from before; the pine forest behind the house has now turned into a barren mountain, and the grandson of Mr. Chun, the gentry and director who used to be noisy in the front village, is said to be living as a thief; the changes in the situation have made me somewhat unable to believe that such a short ten years could feel like a lifetime had passed, although I still remember everything from ten years ago very clearly, however, what I see today is not the hometown of ten years ago!</p>
<p>I have been living in my hometown for more than two months; a rather long summer has passed lightly like this, and now it is autumn again, "Autumn wind and autumn rain sadden people to death," autumn is such a moving season!</p>
<p>This time I came to Stone Man Mountain entirely to change my environment and recuperate my body, which had been worn out by life, so Mei and I stayed in "Qingzhao Tower." "Huzhao Tower" is a small building built next to the "Martyr Shrine" on the shore of Taihu Lake. Inside, the bright windows and clean desks are very elegant. Slightly to the right is "Lanjing Pavilion" and the "Imperial Stele Pavilion." Near the lake beach is "Guiyun Cave" Stone Spiral Valley, and there is also a "Water Recirculation Cave" under the beach. When the water is high, the cave is submerged, and when the water is shallow, there is a stone chess table in the cave where you can play chess. To the left is "A Thread of Sky" and "Cloud Ladder," and behind the mountain foothills are "Stone Man Temple," "Laihe Pavilion, Yingyue Zhai," "Cuiping Pavilion," etc. The beauty of the scenery there really has a sense of being detached from the mundane world? There are cliffs of thousands of feet standing upright, and there are lush and verdant pine forests. There you can watch the sunrise and enjoy the morning mist in the early morning, and on moonlit nights it is suitable for strolling in the moonlight and listening to the waves. On rainy days, it is even better to admire the scenery of "Jiangli Mountain" in the rain. When there is wind, you can sit quietly on the tower and listen to the pine waves and the waves in Taihu Lake hitting the shore, mutually playing the magnificent "Song of Nature."</p>
<p>However, you cannot hear the sounds of roosters crowing and dogs barking here. The surroundings are so quiet, like a "silent zone."</p>
<p>One clear evening, Mei and I walked out of "Huzhao Tower," passed through "A Thread of Sky," and stood on a cliff—I felt that this was like "Sacrifice Cliff"; looking around, I saw that the mountains in the boundless Taihu Lake were faintly lying in the leisurely mist, and the vast twilight was covering the surroundings. Looking down at the cliff, I saw rapid currents surging and angry tides violently pounding the beach. At this moment, I felt like I was in a dream realm, and I only felt that I was so small.</p>
<p>I lay down on the soft grass, watching the white clouds slowly flying outside the azure sky, and watching the sparse stars shining with light. Mei sat beside me, talking with gestures; as for what she said, I didn't pay attention at all, just silently not making a sound...</p>
<p>The fields were so quiet, and the faint Buddhist sounds from the temple plucked at the strings of my heart, lamenting life and fearing reality, I couldn't help but feel a little dazed:</p>
<p>—The moonlight is so lovely, from now on, I will take advantage of this moonlit night to find my eternal home!</p>
<p>The night was deep, the lake wind cooled my heart, and the autumn dew wet my skin; go, go back! Why linger here?</p>
<p>—The moonlit night is still as beautiful and serene as it was in my childhood; but the times have changed, society has changed its face, and even my own environment is completely different.</p>
<p>Silently, Mei and I walked back to "Huzhao Tower."</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Resentful Fate"</p>
<p>Spring breeze blows the fragrance of a hundred flowers. Peach and willow seek spring sunshine. The wind blows one's thoughts into chaos. There is a middle-aged beauty sick in bed. Thinking in her heart. Tears welling up. Her lovers are all fickle. When they first met, their love was so deep. Like lacquer and glue mixed with sugar. But now they see her beauty fading. Each resentful soul does not enter her room. At that time, some people asked for her hand in marriage, but she refused. Waiting for her to regain her beauty and act coquettishly again. Water flows east and never returns. Flowers lose their fragrance when they wither. That beauty thought about it with a troubled heart. Turning around towards the inside of the bed. Thinking of loneliness and sighing sadly.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Group Wedding"</p>
<p>Weddings should be greatly improved. The old methods are too absurd. Spending money lavishly on the ceremony. Kneeling in worship is as troublesome as seeing the Emperor. You also have to prepare paired Heaven and Earth paper. Hanging Harmony in the center of the hall. The bride and groom hold red silk and green silk. Leading each other to the bridal chamber. On the left, high-burning dragon and phoenix candles. Those troublemaking old men still want to tease the bride, all of which is humiliating and deplorable. Too uncivilized, like acting in a play. On the right, we must vigorously promote new methods. Group weddings are unusual. The officiant is an official. The expenses are few and the price is not high. The method is civilized and extremely cautious. Very simple and proper. The man becomes the new groom. The woman becomes the new bride. Better than the old style, which requires painstaking effort. If you want to get married, gentlemen. You should join in, it's most generous. And everyone has a bright face.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Elementary School Students Promoting the Baobao System"</p>
<p>Unenlightened children, trained for a long time, are knowledgeable, learned to speak and debate well, relying entirely on their tongues to speak east and west. During this year's summer vacation, the educators thought it through, using the many students, sending them to promote the Baojia system as officials. Going to the city inside and outside and the townships, exerting their voices to the utmost for official business. Those who live in the city are intelligent, first persuading the merchants and workers. Those who live in the villages are foolish, mostly farmers. The explanation should of course be simple, so that they understand and follow. However, the students' travel expenses should be prepared, and they must not waste their energy and end up empty-handed. The obligations are many and the rights are few, running around and being exposed to the hot wind. I write this opening chapter to persuade the initiators to treat them fairly, so that they can use the young children.</p>

<h3>New Era New News</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>After "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" finished filming on location, due to the seriousness of all parties, the interior scenes were only started yesterday, with overnight work, filming more than twenty shots, each shot with a fresh joke.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when Mr. Wang was filming, many people came to the scene to visit, including Gaoli Hen and Si Zuoming, who arrived one after another. Then, Miss Qin Qiong, the sports queen of Hangzhou, came with many girlfriends to visit. Miss Qin praised Xiao A Yuan Huang Naishuang's extensive skills without end.</p>
<p>All the comedians of the New Era, at the invitation of the flood relief entertainment association, will take the stage to perform two big comedies. Those who admire them but do not know them can take a look at the true faces of Mr. Wang, Tang Jiezi, Chen Cao Xuesong, and Lu Shan at that time.</p>
<p>The New Era's comedy scripts that will be performed on stage at the flood relief entertainment association will be written by Zuo Ming, and one by Cao Xuesong. They are currently being drafted and will be completed soon. It is heard that the themes are novel, not only are the jokes rich, but they also have a profound meaning.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Yun Er</p>
<p>Recently, the "Misspelling Movement" seems to be prevalent in film publications. For example, "Diao Banhua" is written as "Diao Banhua," "Ke Ni" as "Ke Er," "Lao Teng" as "Lao Xi," "Yao Sufeng" as "Yao Huafeng," and Sun Shiyi is even called Sun Shi "Beast."</p>
<p>Some say this is a "little trick." Is it so? (Today I discovered Bao Ke "Pin" in him. Editor)</p>
<p>On the way, I met Chen Gongjia, the "problem figure," and Mr. Chen Yun said: "I have five pieces of evidence of my engagement with Diao Banhua, and I can take them out to the public when necessary."</p>
<p>After the arrival of "Knocking on the Door in the Middle of the Night," Xu, who "eats photos of female stars," is said to have extorted publicity fees from "Sichuan actress" Chen Ailun. That Mr. Xu takes very beautiful photos and chats very well. He said, "I asked Fan ×× to promote you on the radio, you should give Fan ×× some publicity fees."</p>
<p>In addition to taking photos, there are also publicity fees to be taken, no wonder so many film magazines are springing up.</p>
<p>The "Every Picture Film" in the Social Daily on the 19th wrote: "It is heard that Ling He has returned to his hometown in Jiangxi, which is sigh-inducing."</p>
<p>Letter from Zhaohua</p>
<p>After reading the 16th issue of your column, the McGillophone broadcast had a mistake in the "debut of Zhaohua Film Company" as "Residual Dream." It has been found that the company's debut work is "Residual Tears," not "Residual Dream." I am afraid that the error will be passed on, so in addition to sending a letter to McGillophone to clarify, I specially request that you correct it. Sincerely, Zhaohua Film Company Publicity Department</p>

<h3>The Meaning of Modern Architectural Beauty (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Taniguchi Yoshiro, Translated by Zhang Guangzheng</p>
<p>For example, recently there has been a trend of Spanish-style houses in some places. Initially, this style was adopted by people in Spain, Mexico, and other countries for their vernacular architecture. Later, it was imitated by those who liked to emulate a foreign, warm, and beautiful feeling. White walls reflecting red Spanish tiles, small windows giving the walls strong angles, maintaining graceful curves and gentle shadows. These would certainly create a subtle tropical sunset that makes people yearn, quite able to capture people's hearts.</p>
<p>However, such gentle works, if imitated elsewhere, seem somewhat out of place. Originally, in the Mediterranean and near-tropical regions where this style originated, there is strong sunlight, so small windows are naturally needed to prevent direct sunlight from entering. Consequently, the exterior appearance of the building forms strong angles due to the small windows. However, this also blocks the circulation of wind, making the interior feel stuffy. Therefore, in hot climates, the interior of the house must have a courtyard. Opening each room to the courtyard allows cool breezes to circulate freely within the interior. However, in places with high humidity in the summer, the family must open nearly everything. If one merely imitates the external appearance of others, making the entire building a small-windowed, enclosed thing, that would simply be foolish.</p>
<p>In short, the consideration of windows must seek bright sunlight and healthy ultraviolet radiation to achieve the goal of openness. We will feel a fresh and stimulating beauty from purely functional windows and doors that pay attention to the exchange of fresh air and the circulation of cool breezes. Modern architects have deeply felt the healthy beauty of the latter, while aesthetes love the former. Here, we can only say that it is merely a morbid perception.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Instead of using meaningless appearances to create sentimental feelings, we should feel solemn beauty in simplicity without any artifice.</p>
<p>How meticulous is a steel pillar, relying on mechanical calculations, and the purity of its material science in its design! It is much healthier and more beautiful than decorative embellishments. Here, following the urgency of "suitability," one will naturally feel a powerful and uplifting beauty.</p>
<p>In this sense, modern architecture, compared to palaces and temples that are the crystallized designs of past architects, feels the beauty of the new era more so in factories. The latter takes the so-called production function as the primary requirement, eliminating all uneconomical constructions. The beauty of modern architecture is established on the activity of new materials and structures. This can be exemplified by the factory, which is called destructive art and is a purely practical building that fossilizes human emotions. Utilizing raw materials while also paying attention to craftsmanship, construction is carried out with even cranes and bridges being applied.</p>
<p>Thus, factories, which were previously considered non-artistic archetypes, have been built in large numbers, becoming works that possess the shining beauty of new meaning. Standardized materials are combined to create uniform longhouse architectural styles. Thus, things with a new type of beauty are expressed in the world. The so-called "dry construction" method involves assembling and combining factory-made building materials on the building foundation, quickly carrying out construction projects. That is, the construction site does not even need to use water, simply joining the various prepared building materials is enough. Because the building materials are factory-produced improvements, they will not lack anything, nor will they be affected by the weather, achieving extremely economical completion.</p>
<p>Indeed, such mechanized products completely disregard the free-spirited spirit that previously respected art, hindering the progress of artists who strive for creation. However, this type of architecture does complete grand works. That is to say, in modern times, architecture is no longer a personal art but has advanced to being publicly recognized as a social product, erasing the colors of previous individuality in one stroke.</p>
<p>Now, if there is a question of whether a scale exists to distinguish the beauty or ugliness of architecture, then the answer can be that it is based on how it solves the requirements of modern life and how it has a close relationship with modern life. (The End)</p>
<h3>Europe and America Advocate Architectural Undertakings</h3>
<p>— Shen Sheng</p>
<p>Poland Establishes Private Small Housing Loan – Interest at 3.5%, Lumber Prices Reduced</p>
<p>European and American countries are making great efforts to promote architectural undertakings. There are also daily improvements in the theoretical aspects of architecture. Architectural undertakings are directly proportional to the development of cities. Governments of various countries seek urban prosperity and all set about encouraging private construction. Various banks offer low-interest construction loans, giving people investment security. In Europe, countries such as Germany, France, and Italy have adopted this policy of rewarding architectural undertakings, with the newly emerging Poland being the most enthusiastic. Poland is a gold standard country and has not been affected by the world monetary trends in recent years. The economic foundation is becoming increasingly stable. Poland's architectural loan started in 1925 and was handled by the Polish National Economic Bank. The purpose was to promote the construction of privately owned housing. Anyone who wants to build can borrow from the bank. The interest charged is extremely low, and the conditions are very favorable. Since the loan began to be issued, local authorities, agencies, and private individuals have all borrowed. Later, the amount of building loans prepared by the government decreased daily, and the lending method was changed. Subsequent lending will focus on the construction of private small houses. To facilitate the implementation of this plan, to encourage private investment in small real estate, the government is making every effort to directly reduce construction costs. The government is forcing the reduction of building material prices and is also making every effort to reduce transportation costs. Lumber from state-owned companies can even be bought on credit. In short, the government is making every effort to eradicate all obstacles that impede the development of architectural undertakings. In addition, everything that indirectly increases the cost of buildings, such as material taxes, management fees, patterning fees, registration fees, etc., are also sought to be reduced. For example, since June 1, 1933, the government has automatically reduced the interest on building loans from 6% to 3%, even down to three-quarters or 3.5%. In 1933, a new law was promulgated exempting new house building taxes. Another point that is sufficient to help the development of small house construction is the depreciation of the value of foreign currencies, especially the depreciation of the value of the American gold dollar, which is most beneficial to small savers. Because of the depreciation of the value of currencies, they all invested in architectural undertakings. In 1933, the government issued building housing loans amounting to 14,500,000 Polish złoty. The houses built totaled 28,819 rooms, with a total of 8,200 stories. The total cost was 65,000,000 Polish złoty. From this, it can be seen that people generally invest in small houses. In 1934, the building loans issued by the government increased to 34,500,000 Polish złoty, of which 23,200,000 Polish złoty, or 67.4%, was specifically for building houses. In addition, 9,700,000 Polish złoty, or 28.3%, was for the construction of large houses. In 1934, a total of 40,000 small houses were built, totaling 14,200 stories. The total cost was 85,000,000 Polish złoty. From 1932 to 1934, a total of 35,000 stories of small houses were built, totaling 90,000 rooms, of which private investment accounted for 24%. In the 1935 budget, the government decided to allocate 18,600,000 Polish złoty specifically for lending to small house construction out of the 36,000,000 Polish złoty building loan stipulated. Therefore, the construction of small houses this year will have even more satisfactory results. In order to improve the quality of building materials, the Polish National Economic Bank, in addition to being responsible for economic guidance, is also making every effort to make buildings more solid. Therefore, the results of the bank's bidding plans on behalf of small homeowners can obtain the most solid houses at the lowest cost. In addition to the Polish National Economic Bank making every effort to guide the housing construction of small households, the Polish Cooperation Association also has a building house consulting office, serving the society all year round.</p>
<h3>Internal Analysis of Ancient Chinese Architecture (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yun</p>
<p>(2) Walls - For important buildings, the walls are mostly made of stone. Ordinary houses are made of brick and wood. Most Chinese wooden houses have wooden pillars standing on stone or brick foundations to prevent moisture and rot. Sometimes the bricks have glazed and colored surfaces, so the walls are sometimes made of glazed tiles. The walls look very thick, but they are mostly hollow in the middle, partly to save materials and partly to give the house a suitable climate. Walls also have "single" and "double" distinctions. There is also a type called a fire wall, which is built on the roof at the south end of the two廂房 (side rooms), generally five or six feet higher than the roof, standing side by side with the wall gate. Its use is, firstly, to prevent the fire from the neighbors from spreading. Secondly, it can also avoid the attack of strong winds.</p>
<p>(3) Doors and Windows - The form of the door, whether it is a main door or a side door, is rectangular. However, below the parallel wood, various fine patterns are carved, and the external shape becomes various states. The pailou (archway) is a special kind of gateway in China. Sometimes it is used for the gates of temples and tombs; sometimes it is used to commemorate the sages; sometimes it is erected on the street. Its structure was originally made of wood, with two or more pillars. There are inlaid woods horizontally, creating one, two, or three gateways. Sometimes, many flower stands are built, like those used under the eaves of temple halls.</p>
<p>The form of the window is also rectangular, and many wooden strips are framed horizontally and vertically in the square frame, dividing a window into many small squares. Each small square is inlaid with a thin layer of shell, commonly called "Li shell," which is a kind of translucent slippery stone quality. The light that the sun shines in, after passing through this layer of shell, is very soft and bright. In the windows of rural areas in the interior, because of the recent water and drought disasters, even though this "Li shell" is extremely cheap, it is also impossible to use it. It is only replaced by paper.</p>
<p>(4) Roof - The roof of a house is the main object of a house. Chinese roofs are completely opposite to the styles of Greece and the Roman Renaissance. In the various Greek styles, one wants to hide the roof. The Chinese roof and ridge, however, use various methods to make it appear dignified and imposing, especially the decoration of the ridge, which varies according to wealth and status.</p>
<p>In the former autocratic era, it was indeed not easy to decorate a ridge. The two so-called "incubating chicken fan heads" at the two ends of the ridge; the form of the incubating chicken fan heads is like two chickens incubating at the two ends of the ridge, distinguishing the nobility and lowliness of the people. Ordinary people who can install these two things must have donated to become a "jian sheng" (Imperial College student), otherwise it will be torn down for you. There is also a kind called "sitting plate incubating chicken," which is to put a piece of gang brick under the chicken; such a family must have the status of a "ju ren" (successful candidate in the provincial examination) from the former Qing Dynasty to be able to build it. The tiles on the roof are usually stacked one by one from the bottom up, one tile is placed facing up, and one is placed facing down, which looks very solemn, and this kind of empty stacking can adjust the indoor over-cold and over-heat. The one in the very center of the roof is called the "Zheng Liang (main beam)," which is supported by wooden pillars at both ends and is unrelated to the attached walls. Part of the top is recessed. Ordinary S-shaped tiles for hanging axes are used, glued with gray, and sometimes they are also used for connection to prevent them from being lifted by the wind. Some people think that this kind of empty curved top originates from the "curtain" of the primitive era. Some people think that it is the result of using bamboo, which is curved due to heavy pressure. However, this is a design to avoid the direct exposure of light, to protect the fragile walls, and to prevent rainwater from accumulating on the roof. The roof frame is made of a rectangular "golden center frame." The method of connecting bamboo together with wooden joints. In this way, the weight of the roof is vertical, not inclined to the walls.</p>
