<p>（巴黎）內閣頃於晨間九時三十分舉行會議、直至十二時十分始乃散會、當發表公報稱、賴伐爾總理曾將英法意三國關於意阿爭端解决方案進行談判經過、提出報告、內閣一致表示贊成、其對於意阿爭端形勢好轉、幷表示滿意云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）賴伐爾總理現屆試騐其調解國際大局能力之時機、彼擬乘國聯五十二國委員會於十月三十一日再度在日內瓦開會之前、進行東菲戰事和解之努力，惟賴氏就任總理後衆院賦予之全權亦將於十月三十一日期滿、此事復使賴氏際此國際風雲正急之時、復遭遇國內之難題矣、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據政界發言人語路透訪員、謂現進行之外交談話、乃屬普通性質、其用意僅在聲明一切、並無提出解决意阿爭案切實建議之問題云、（二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）外交次長蘇維區曾於昨日午後延見英國大使德魯蒙爵士、據官方人士聲稱、此次會晤目標係就各項主要問題交換意見、並未提出任何新建議云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間今日咸信、英意關係之和緩有導成意阿媾和之可能、觀察者認歐洲之空氣已起變化、國聯五十二國委員會將停會至十月三十一日、俾外交家得於决定完全抵制竟貨之日期前、進行和議（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間可靠方面今日消息墨索里尼首相已準備開始談判意阿紛爭之「根本解决辦法」、惟於英國减少地中海艦隊及停止在日內瓦之敵意態度之前、墨氏當不允討論、另一可靠方面今日云、墨氏須於下列三點辦到之後、始能進行交涉、（一）英國艦隊退出地中海、（二）國聯暫停經濟制裁、（三）准許意國「鞏固」在阿已經佔領之土地、據悉第三項之意義、爲意國希望於交涉開始之時、已能盡佔阿國之低窪區域、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）政界人士以爲關於阿比西尼亞問題之談判、現雖已在進行中、然此一問題異常複雜、在最短時期內、恐難獲得解决、聞意國政府所提出解决意阿爭端之最低條件、英法兩國認爲不能滿意、已加以拒絕、但半官人士則信意相墨索里尼現正考慮英法兩國之異議、不久或可再行提出新建議云、半官人士並希望談判可繼續進行、但以爲在本年內恐不能解决、蓋一切解决方案、必須經阿皇同意，國聯會認爲滿萬而後可、英國所擔任者則爲傳達消息而已、最後决定之權、仍當在國聯會行政院、惟就目前形勢、國聯會逐步實施制裁之結果、或可逼迫意大利使其逐漸削减其所提出之要求、至於國聯會、則對於一切方案、苟爲英法阿三國所同意者、自亦必樂於接受，謠傳意阿兩國政府暗中進行談判、可見墨索里尼亦並未將阿皇置之腦後也、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 端</p>
<p>自交通器具日以新。駕駛不愼而傷人肇禍者。乃時有所聞夫人命至重也。殘廢終身。人生最苦痛之事也。試想自身或親族戚友。撞車受傷。其苦痛怨恚爲何如乎。世人推仁及物。尙有護生戒殺之行。奈何可於人命而草菅之。兒戲之。今之駕汽車者。每遇肇禍。輒歸咎於行人。以行路之不小心。而與汽車相撞。事或有之。但如駕車者能知人命爲重。固不難救人於刹那之間。何况死者逝矣孰能起而問之。汽車殺汝抑係汝。之自不小心乎。若汽車肇禍。而可一味歸咎於行人。則駕車人益將漫不經心矣。至在車上人行道。殺人毀物。而亦以道路濘滑爲口實。謂非駕車者之罪。則更匪夷所思矣。</p>
<p>嘗思汽車肇禍之由來。（一）由於開車人之技術不熟。或體力不逮。目力較遜經過長時間之開駛。神疲目倦。偶不經心禍患立作。長途汽車之自行顚覆。大都爲駕車者無休息之機會。不能恢復疲勞之故。亦有由於俾晝作夜。無充分之睡眠酗酒尋樂。失駕馭之能力而肇禍者。（二）由於機械之障礙。煞車失其靈便。駕駛不得自如。（三）坐汽車者。類皆饒有資財。具有聲勢。罰非所懼。錢所惜。於是開車乃敢不顧一切矣。（四）少數憑藉共特殊勢力。不受我法律之裁者。輒駕車疾駛。任意違反行車規章。（五）營業汽車。有時不顧行車規章。開車疾駛。攬奪乘客。往往引起嫉妬鬥毆毀車傷人等　。肇禍之由大抵如是。</p>
<p>吾人以爲欲策公衆行路之安全。（一）對於開車執照之給予。應取嚴格之檢定。而車輛尤應隨時抽查。以騐其械械之良否。（二）行車規章。不容以駕駛者之身分問題。而有所軒輊。務必嚴格執行。如羅斯福總統之子行車違章。美法院不爲輕恕斯可矣。（三）傷害人命除吊銷開車執照外。不當僅以處罰金爲限。亦宜處以刑期若此則金錢失效而知所畏憚矣。（四）其有悍然不顧者則應由地方當局設法交涉以濟法律之　。（五）上海馬路當初祇供馬車人車之行走二十年來市廛日盛。汽車發達。舊有之馬路不足以容納之。尤其如城內道路。仍保持其舊式街巷。人力車往來。尙須互讓。而亦准許汽車同時通行。行路之人大爲窘迫。故非將道路從速整理。不能减少行車之危險。此則有望於各市政當　者也。</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （太玄）　　人一離了哺乳時期，就會學著走路。那時候晃晃盪湯的狠脆弱的脚花，全恃着大人們來扶持。有時候不小心跌痛了，就放聲大哭，哭過了依舊還是學着走。人，終是這樣經歷的。　　在小孩子學着走路，漸漸的跳跳蹦蹦，活潑愉快，在沿着自然而天眞的環境中邁進，他小心腔裏，是沒有一點別的思想滲雜着。　　有了長江大河，也就有了廣大的大陸。有了康莊的衢道，也就有了三岔的官徑。待一踏入社會，那世路的崎嶇，甜酸，苦辣，一腦兒都要請你嘗到。那時候很脆弱的脚花，再沒有大人們來扶持你了。悼戈公振先生  黃寄萍　　—歸國七天，竟與世永訣—　　戈歸國七天，竟與世永訣公振先生，在游歐歸來的第七天，突然患腹膜炎逝世於上海虹橋療養院，噩耗傳出，各方人士，無不痛惜！戈氏畢生盡瘁於新聞事業，在中國報界可算是個傑出的人才。他一生最値得人們敬仰的，便是持躬處世的忠實，和刻苦服務的精神。關於他的一切，我本想寫一篇詳盡的文字，以誌哀悼，可是在這個時侯，心緒很亂，要說的千端萬緒，一把亂麻，簡直找不出頭來。現在姑且把他歸國七天中的動靜，拉雜寫來，以吿戈先生的親友。　　十月十五日晚上，我們知道戈氏乘俄輸「北方號」回國，我和幾位朋友正預備歡迎，不料九時許戈氏欣然走到本報編輯部，同人爭與握手，看他神采奕奕，暢叙良久，他便回到新亞酒店安歇。　　十六日上午，他拜訪海上的親友，午後各方友好，聯袂偕來，談得很有勁。晚八時，我到新亞，陪他赴友人之宴，一路向北四川路走去，他說起雙十節在海參崴　館，參加國慶紀念禮，忽然暈倒，但不久便醒過來，因急於趕回，船上風浪大，精神疲乏，到滬後始稍復原。　　十七日午時我到新亞，他已出了門，晚上電話吿我說：今天和許多朋友們會談，雖倦而十分愉快。　　十八日上午，他說昨晚回寓太遲，受了風寒，精神不振，中止參觀全運會。晚上我設宴爲他洗塵，到林　民，胡桂庚，陳掌　等六七人，戈氏到得很早，神色灰白，穿了呢大衣，也不覺累，酒不喝，也不能吃菜肴，一會兒周劍雲之約，又應酬　了。　　十九日上午我本約他去弔張孝若之喪，他對張氏慘遭變故，異常悲痛，看他精神萎靡，勸稍靜養，我便獨自去弔。晚上又去訪晤，吿以本報同人定期開會歡迎，他說這幾天應酬眞忙，最好等我晉京報吿之後，再圖歡敘，所以日期暫緩决定。　　二十日友人勸他移虹橋療養院靜養，以避賓客訪談之繁，所以知道他進院的，不過三五人而已。　　二十一日下午二時，醫院來電，說他腹痛，體溫激增，斷爲盲腸炎，須刀割，我們幾個人便趕去慰問，那時面色更白，自願割治，且說在德國時曾割治鼻病，並無痛苦，態度鎭靜。五時一刻，由董醫生施手術，約一小時畢，談笑自若。醫說症尙輕，可無問題，我們很放心，便各自返歸。　　二十二日晨九時許，病突變，氣喘漸急，精力大變，醫說症變了，他自己也明白，沒有希望了，願意把遺體請紅十字會作病理剖解，供醫學參考，關於他的著作及未了事，也簡短的說出，大家聽了心如刀割，但束手無策，至午後二時，這位服務二十年的報人，竟與世長辭！臨別的人，除親屬外，有馬蔭良，鄒韜奮，蔣光堂，周劍雲夫婦，胡蝶，歐陽予倩，錢滄碩及作者等八九人。  涓隱　　和平之神，現在應該請你坐鎮？小西天  張恨水著　　第二十回　掙拿看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年憶往事種麥招殃　　朱胡氏左手拖了右手的袖子口，只管在兩隻眼角上揉擦着。又揷嘴道：我是不要他去當兵的呵！可是不要他去當兵，也得成呵！周太太笑道：我們這位怯奶奶，你就不必說了，讓你姑娘一個人說罷。說畢，掉轉身來，向月英注着。到了這時，他已是忍不住他胸中那一分子悽楚，便流着淚道：那我就說罷。是那兩年，鬧着旱災，我們那裏，荒得吃樹皮草根……朱胡氏道：你爹去的日子，還沒有荒到那樣呵！周太太眞氣了，頓了脚道：叫你不要打岔，他剛說兩句，你又揷嘴了，以後你不用管。他就是說的不對，也等他說完，你再開口，喂！姑娘，你說。月英點點頭道：是的，是我說錯了，還是鬧旱災的第一年呢。先是糧食都漲價，六七斤麥子，賣到一塊錢。我家住在到定西縣去三十里的李家堡。這裏是一個小鎭市，鎭市上人，有作買賣的，也有種地的。我爹也種地，也做買賣。周太太道：你們做什麽買賣呢？月英道：我們是湖南人，我爹會做湖南菜，開了一家小飯館子。周太太道：哦！是了，我聽說這一條西大路上，湖南人開館子的很多，你們是左宗棠平西的時候，跟了來的人嗎？在床上躺的那個老太答道：哼！他公公，就是那個時候來的。朱胡氏推了他道：娘！你不要說，說了這太太不高興的。周太太微笑了一笑，向著月英一點頭。（二四六）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　但事後想來，我們每天總得在園內來來往往地遊玩，好半嚮，旣有了那樣的奇事，何以竟會一個人都不看見呢？老實說：如其不是宮內有着這麽一個「萬事必報太后」的習慣，我們或者始終不會知道咧！原來宮內有一種習慣，無論一件怎樣瑣細的事，看來分明是一毫不値注意的，都得啟奏太后：因爲太后的心思似乎有些和別人不同，伊往往要把一件偶爾發生的極微細的事情看得十分重大。　　天氣已是深秋了，突然在某一株玉蘭樹上開出了一朶鮮花來，我們都不曾注意到，但終於給一個當園丁的太監首先發現了；他知道這是一件非報吿不可的事情，但他同時却又捏着一大把冷汗，險些嚇得不敢去報告。因爲他們當太監的人地位旣低，知識又淺，怎能預先料到這個消息奏上去之後，對於他們自己將發生什麼影響呢，也許碰得不巧，竟會敎他糊裏糊塗的受一塲大罪，而實際上他自己却沒有半些錯處；待到太后後來再醒悟，也來不及了。可是利害雖難預料，這件事却無論如何總得去奏明的。（這些情形都是我後來才知道的）這個園丁經過了好半嚮的遲疑，便决意把這件異事先去吿訴那總管太監李蓮英。（四四二）茶會  （張慕良）　　從前商人所談的交易或賣買，完全是聚集在茶樓中的，因之，這茶會的名字，就在那時產生出來出茶會的意義有二：一，是商人藉以聚集，二，是買買藉以便利。但，茶會是很有區別的，譬如×茶樓是爲×帮商人之茶會，那麼×帮商人便會不約而同的集在×茶樓中的，所以各種商人談賣買的茶會，都有一定的地方。　　除了商人的茶會之外，也有什麽偵探的茶會，什麽流氓的茶會，什麽……上海對於各種茶會的名稱，不下數百種；就偵探的茶會而言，他們也是聚集茶樓中，凡偵探之夥，倘無事的時候，他們也是常常聚集在茶樓中的。倘遇到有什麼事情發生的時候，他們便會一呼而至，等到他捉到了盜賊後，他們先把捉住的盜賊，帶至他們的茶會，盤詰口供，對於這種茶會，個中人當然很熟悉的。在茶樓中，流氓的隱語，有所謂「蟠桃」者，即茶會是也。花塲  叔範　　由吳淞追凉歸來，夜已逾午，望樹頭懸落月如盤，意興殊未已。熟聞西門花塲，殘更聚市，至熱鬧；因浼惠石爲導焉。過文廟路，高梧分凉，蔭三五街燈，黝綠如星，悄靜，薄有鄉村味。入公平路，烈芬刺鼻，語聲若殷雷動；見肩挑筐挈而趨者，皆花販也。售者，買者，男女老少咸有，蟻攢及數千人。花陳列兩砌，盆蒔茅縛，諸色靡不備。尤以紅蓮白蕖爲最悅目。問其値，每朶銅元十枚，試在日間購之，非兩輔幣莫辦也。折藍維藹路處，更有茶樓一座，專售白蘭茉莉；每毫換百二十蕊，賣花女得之，響於市，爲利殊厚。聞花戶均來自龍華及浦東等處，滬人士襟佩而室供者，日取給於是焉。鄉民因此而資活八口者，亦不止數千百家也。一物之微，以培之得法，用者有人，便足裨益民生。地無廢物，信然。新發明  （無無生）　　白米中有毒素　日本靜岡縣御殿塲東山廣太郞之子岩田元兄氏，在最近理化學研究所，發現白米中有猛烈的毒素，這毒素比任何毒蛇的毒質爲厲窖，稱之謂。離梭雷司丁。就是在雷司丁中混入蛇毒一樣的東西。我們的神經赤血球中；受這毒素的刺激，就起中毒變化，輕則妨害發育，重則殞命，現已爲世界各國學者共同研究的對象。岩田氏發明這毒素後，得釗農學博十的學位。　　雞蛋殼含强壯劑　用雞蛋殼，研末，每日冲開水呑服，可以補精養力，這是最近日本岡本博士根據牡蠣殼可治氣喘的經騐，攝取加爾西姆以收歛炎症增加白血球含菌現象，以及增血止血的原理而發明的。現今醫家公認狄亞林酸與乳酸加爾西姆，利於虛弱腺病質人的身體。這卵殼如變爲鹽化加爾西姆時，可作健胃藥，尤比對於有呼吸病與慢性腹膜等病，能使加爾西姆直接達到患部，爲效很大。又能助長齒骨，如十歲以上的兒童與姙婦，常服這卵設粉，能促進發育。　　姙娠新鑑別法　我們要　別婦人有否姙娠，可取婦人的尿一瓢，混入淸水一杯，用一匹三十生的大的小雌鯉，游泳其中，如婦女已有孕，那小魚的輸卵管，必要膨脹，卵子排出體外，若無孕，魚仍舊不變樣子，但須經過二十四小時，才可判別，這是芝加哥大學敎授所發明的。　　不用土種稻法　從來種植植物，須用土壤，最近日本春日井新一郞與南禮藏氏，發明不用土壤，祇用水就可培養，而且依照此法，即在都會的住屋內，亦可以種植蔬菜花草，果樹等。其法：把養分溶解於水中，以此人工培養液，浸植物的根，植物吸收了水中的養分，就會開花結實，即從發育初期至結實爲止，完全用水耕液培養。水耕液的成分，如栽培蔬菜的，在一李得爾中，爲硝酸阿姆尼亞〇·〇五七五克蘭姆，燐酸加里〇·〇三八三克蘭姆，鹽化加里〇·〇四三〇克蘭姆，硫酸苦土〇·二四五〇克蘭姆，等溶化而成的A液與硝酸石灰〇·二七〇克蘭姆，鹽化第二鐵〇·一十五米里克蘭姆等混和而成的B液，將AB二液混和，即可栽培各種蔬菜類。</p>

<p>自由談新秋日本文壇風景綫（東京通信）  洛之　　有一位日本的作家在一篇文藝時評中說，日本的文壇上的現象、正好比夫婦在深夜中吵架一般，光原見尖聲呌喊，而無從知道它的底細。這話雖帶有兒分幽默的味道、然面也有幾分眞理。如幾年前的，「新社會派」，「新心理派」，「新感覺派」，即可歸入此種範例。即就最近何常不還是在演着這種新陳代謝的現象？關於這我們可以舉出「行動主義」，「實錄文學」，「偶然論」來。　　行動主義的敗北　　日本的所謂行動主義，本是日本的自由主義和法國的「行動的人間主義」結合起來的東西。自由主義在十年以前，可以說和左翼思想是日本並立着的兩大思潮，前者的來源是法國，後者的夾源是俄國和德國。後來，左翼思想得勢而壓下了自由主義，這樣繼續到了去年，左翼思想遭了一時的敗退，同時自由主義由於得了法國的「行動的人間主義」這種新的會流，而復興起來了。由是創刊了「行動」雜誌，作爲發表機關，刊行叢書，確有席捲全日本文壇之勢。然到了本年四五月的時候，便又露出了衰敗的徵侯，當時行動主義的理論家小松淸氏爲了挽救這種情勢，而發了這樣的豪語，而沒有人幹了，我一個人來幹！」這樣總算勉勉强强支持到了現在，而終於支持不下去，也不得不將其機關，「行動」宣吿停刊了。現在回想行動主義所得到的收獲，是什麽呢？恐怕也只有最近開設的所謂，行動吃茶店」罷。那號稱爲行動主義的作家的舟橋聖一氏，還發了這樣的一段絕呌：　　「……行動主義在這裏雖然被命令着退出了集納主義，然而在行動主義的精神之中，還有着悠悠的生命，作着今後日本文學的大的指導力，在這上點上，縱然上朝一夕受了挫折，而也是不能死亡的。而反倒可以說是前途光耀着多望的明光罷。這個靑年世代的精神狀態，將要毫無損害的愈法發展下去，爲什麽呢？因爲目下正流布着文化統制，而作爲文化擁護，技術的價値，學問的自由，知識階級的防衛等，作爲課題，而逼迫着日本的知識者的全面的時候，行動主義的任務是更要加大的。但最後要說的，是行動主義不單是對於私小說而製作富於行動性的新社會小說的風格的文學流派，而是更大的文學精神，而是出自緊迫的文學者的節操的態度的問題。」　　這成了喪家之狗的行動主義，如果不從新換換幹法，雖然這樣地絕呌，恐怕也很難復興起來。　　實錄文學的進出　　關於實錄文學的提倡，我曾在本刊上介紹過一次，那時所介紹的，只不過是實錄文學的發生根據，創作理論，但現在這種運動更加擴大了，甚至還出了一種雜誌，即名爲「實錄文學」。原有的人爲木村毅，貴司山治，田村榮太郞，械村淸二，岩崎榮，笹本寅，片岡貢，新加入者有海音寺潮五郞，戶川貞雄，豐島薰等。自然這些人對於實錄文學，都各有各的解釋，參加的動機也各不相同。　　木村毅是從他向來的傳記小說的立塲，解釋實錄文學，並且他還以「賴山陽」爲起首，而在從事於傳記文學的工作。　　貴司山治作爲實錄文學的提倡者，而寫了許多的論文。一是大衆文學的卑俗性的排除，一是文學大衆化的問題，作品有「石田三成」。現在這篇作品，作爲新協劇團的一週年紀念的公演，而在築地小劇塲上演。　　岩崎榮，寫了一部呌作天保忠臣藏的實錄小說。是寫發生於出羽的農民暴動的東西。　　筏本寅以「海舟與按摩」，「幕末紅燈譜」，而忠實地描寫了維新史的斷面。　　片岡貢從實錄文學的立塲寫了「鐵砲和鶴吉」，並且還寫了一篇「到實錄文學的過程」，規定着實錄文學說：　　「扶正傳統地大衆化了的歷史的實錄的錯誤，旺盛訴諸於大衆的知識興味的企圖，不用說這是歷史文學的立塲。但歷史並不是作爲死掉的東西而在彼岸，那是現代的我們的內容。作爲死的東西而處理那只不過是考古學者而已。欲想知道過去，非知道現在不可，欲想知道現代非知道過去的歷史不可。這雖相反，但在這兩個東西的相互理解之中，描寫現代的人間的眞的歷史文學，却由之生出了。而且只要是文學，就不能輕視作家的想像生和幻想生的。不但這樣，作家的想像和幻想，還可以無限地向着被歪曲，被埋沒了的歷史底記錄了間隙活動的。只要貫澈着的那個史觀健全——」　　這雖然是片岡氏個人的章見，但也可以說是全體的意見，因爲在反對卑俗，猥雜的娛樂讀物，而處輝歷史的眞實，給以現代的解釋，要求表現的單純是會員共通一致的主張的原故。　　實錄文學研究會，自春季創始以來，除以上所說的成績之外，雖還沒有顯著的大工作出現，然而由於「實錄文學」這個雜誌的產生，我們可斷定它在最近會阡盛起來的。自然描寫（中）  屈軼　　在這裏所謂學仙的人，實際上，就是學自然的人。學自然的人，據說他的死是不呌做死的。是呌做物化。因爲他是自然的一枚一節，自然有其交易；他的死，便是自然之變易而已。並非眞的是死了。因爲形骸的存在與否，不能作爲生死的定則。所謂「塵垢粃糠」，亦可以「陶鑄堯舜一的。惟有學「藐姑射之山之神人，不食五穀，吸風飲露，乘雲氣，御飛龍，而遊手四海之外，其神凝，使物不疵癘……大浸稽天而不溺，大早金石流，土山焦而不熱。』才甚辦法。才是他們所企求的自然與人的統一的人格。自然崇拜者的最高目標，便是追求這種統一的人格。　　然而，按實際說，所謂統一，决不是這一方向另一方投降，完全消滅這一方的個性，而依歸於另一方的個性裏。自然崇拜者所追求的統一的人格，毋寗說是消滅自己的人格而依歸在自然的支配下。這不是統一，而是毀滅。眞正的統一，必然是在人與自然的英勇的鬥爭裏。易經之所謂「革」，便是這個意思。彖曰：「水火相息，二女同居，其志不得，曰革。革而信之，文明以說，大亨以正。革而當，其悔乃亡。天地革而四時成。湯武革命，順乎天而應乎人。革之時大矣哉。」因爲革，就是對立的統一，就是演變，自然有它自身的對立的統一，演變爲四時；人與自然又有其對立的統一，這統一完成於革命中。自然崇拜者，在其本質上，是忘卻了自己的存在，從沒有跟自然建立一個正確的關係過。從而反映到文學上來，必然充滿了泛神論的精神。文學裏自然描寫的泛神論的精神，不特中國文學里甚爲明顯，即十九世紀的歐洲文學裏，也非常興盛。我們隨便揀一個人來說，便可明自。　　譬如英國湖畔詩人華滋屋斯（Wordsworth在他抒情詩集裏，差不多全是歌詠自然的。虹、，黃水仙，雲雀，胡蝶，郭公，岩上櫻草，潰泉，追胡蝶的知更鳥等等，所歌詠都是自然界的一事一物。且都寄托贊美的感情。和中國田園詩人陶潛差不多。柯立浬治Colerige說，他和華滋渥斯一共付着的第一年，他們是常常以詩底二大要素爲談話的題材的，即忠實地描出自然底眞實，使讀者同情，和藉想象之變化的色彩，喚起奇據的興味。這是他們詩裏二種力。他又說：『在華滋渥斯，是喚起在習慣的麻醉下的人底注意，呌人對着這個在我們面前時世界底美與不可思議，而感到日常事物之珍奇，引起一種類似超自然的感覺，這是他作詩的目的』（見Coleridge:　Biographia　literaria中）這裏所謂超自然的感覺，就是神的觀念。可看見他對自然的態度，是泛神論的了。他底短詩虹，就是那麽的說着：　　「吾見天上虹，　　吾心爲急跳；　　幼時見此虹，　　與今同美好：　　吾老吾或死，　　惟虹永不消；　　時序忽推移，　　孩提旋作父；　　爲有自然之憐恤，　　我顧韶光日日相繫住。』　　又如早春之歌里：　　當我偃臥在森林中，　　我聽到千種交錯的音調；　　在那甘美的氣分里，我心中，　　快樂的想頭把憂愁帶來了。　　自然將它美麗的造物，　　跟流過我胸頭的人類靈魂結合，　　呌我想起了世人底作爲，　　我的心頭發了强烈的歎息。　　在那綠架下櫻草叢中，　　雁來紅底花藤蔓延，　　我知道那每一朶花兒，　　在快樂地吸着空氣！　　周圍有小鳥翩翻而嬸，　　他們底思念，我不能測憶；　　但即使他們微微的一轉，　　猶得仿彿爲快樂之震顫。　　新茁的小枝展成一扇，　　兜攔那風兒吹來；　　這呌我不得不想起，　　這兒是充滿了快樂歡喜。　　如果這信念是上天送來，　　如果這是「自然」底種聖意志。　　那人類所做的一切　　我有何理由，爲之歡息。　　從這些詩里，自然與神與永恒，巳經是三位一體了；惟有人是渺小的，霎那的。但人果然是渺小的，霎那的嗎？不，人類歷史所昭示的，人，决不如詩人所想象的那樣軟弱無能。在許多地方，反而顯出人是自然的主宰者，自然底創造者。將自然中的電力，導入正當的用途，是人。將自然中的光與熱，予以適當的調節，是人。祇有能勇敢地直視人間的人，他也能正確地理解自然，正確地建立人與自然的關係。所以雖然不是生在人力可以勝天的時代里，要是他是個人生的歌者，他也决不屈服於自然，拜倒於自然之前的。唐代詩人杜甫，無論他經過如何苦難，在他詩里，却沒有把自然作爲神來敬仰。因爲他不願逃避人世，到自然的懷里去，求自然的慰撫，固毋庸神化自然了。他詩里所描寫的自然，都是給放在人力之下。如：「岱宗夫如何，齊魯靑未了。這化鍾神秀，陰陽割香曉。盪胸生層雲，决眥人歸鳥；會當凌絕頂，一覽衆山小。』這就表示了即以自然之神奇而人力亦足以戰勝之的那種氣度。即不然，他寫自然，也是因人因事，作爲一種背景而描寫的。如羗村一首云：「崢嶸赤雲西。日脚下平地，柴門鳥雀噪，歸客千里至。妻孥怪我在，驚定還拭淚；世亂遭　蕩，生還偶然遂。鄰人滿牆頭，感歎亦歔欷。夜闌更秉燭，相對如夢寐。又如白沙渡：『畏途隨長江，渡口下絕岸。差池上舟楫，查窕人雲漢：天塞荒野外，日暮中流半。我馬向北嘶，山猿飲相喚。水淸石礧礧，沙白灘漫漫，適然洗愁辛，多病一疏散。高壁抵嶔崟，洪濤越凌亂；臨風猶廻首，攬習復三歎』。都沒有神化自然之處。如白沙渡日在其中顯示出人與自然的鬥爭的姿勢。再不然，他也把自然還他一個本來面目。如野望詩：『淸秋望不極，迢遞起曾陰。遠水兼文淨，孤城隱霧深。葉稀風史落，山廻日初沈。獨鶴歸何晚，昏鴉已滿林』。人生小記  桀人　　小時候，常常愛跑到海灘邊去捉蟹，爲着捉蟹，不知給母親責罵過多少次，因爲每次總是弄得滿身泥淖的歸來，當興冲冲的捉蟹歸來，突受到一頓責罵，未免是一件掃興的事。但是責罵管責罵，我仍管我去捉，那股蠻勁兒，不知使慈愛的母親受盡多少閒氣哩。　　不過話得說回來，這大半還是爲着家同海邊距離太近，走到外面來玩，是會不知不覺的玩到海灘邊去。在海灘上看見那些橫行將軍，便會油然生要捉牠回來的念頭，於是也就動手去捉了。　　每次的結果，除了弄得滿身是泥淖外，還帶回一種罐的俘虜，那些東西被一同囚在　罐裏，拼命的亂爬，想要衝出這個牢籠，那尖銳的爪子，抓得鐵罐率率的響，要準備抓破牠的樣子。但是逃到那裏去？還不是仍在那只鐵罐裏。看見這樣子，我便得意的笑了。至於那些東西怎樣處置呢？有時候是把牠們養在一只小罎裏，不過養那種東西畢竟沒有意思，因爲那種蟹並沒有鮮美的滋味，而可供你嚼一頓，所以也不到多久，就不感興趣的把牠們丟了。有時候是將牠們玩弄一番，任意處死，自己儼然是一位操生殺權的魔王。現在回想到自己那時候的殘忍心情，不覺駭怪起來，仔細想想，那也很平常，人類社會裏，比這還　慘酷十萬倍的事儘多着哩！這究竟還是其小焉者。　　論到捉法，是十分簡單，也很巧妙，那些活生生的東西，你道是怎樣捉的？是只用一條麻繩，方法是先在繩的一端做好一個圈套，把牠安在蟹洞口，人就不聲不響的埋伏在繩後面，一待蟹身才露出洞口時，就馬上把那麻繩用力一拉，那只蟹就立刻被扯出洞外。那時候，就是小跌牠個半死，也弄得牠幽團轉的不知東南西北。老實說，不落那個圈套則已，一落那個圈套是不用想逃命了　　這種巧計，很有點像舊小說中常說到的「絆馬索」，有許多英雄好漢常常落在絆馬索」裏，以致無用武之地。想到蟹的被捉，何嘗不是如此？不過慣用此種奸計的人，畢竟是卑鄙不足道的呀！　　現在自已已是一個成人，而且在這社會裏混混了，那種玩意兒自然早已拋開，也不會再有那種興緻的。但是我還時常想到，我更意識到現在自己也是一只蟹呀！在我的面前，是有着史多的圈套，專等我投進去，或者我要比蟹的運命更爲可怕吧？貴人之酒賤人之淚  黃士英作沒有人知道（一）  休伍·安特生作何爲譯　　喬治·韋拉特很小幾地朝着四周看了一下，從溫期堡鷹報館的辦公室的寫字檯邊站起身來，打從後門匆匆地跑出去了。夜是溫暖而且陰黯的。雖則還不到八點鐘，可是報館辦公室後面的小弄堂里已經漆黑。一羣繫在附近黑黯中的木椿上的牡馬，在焦硬的泥地上踐踏着。一隻貓從喬治。韋拉特的脚邊跳了出來，又向着黑夜中逃去。這年輕的人有點膽怯。他是一整天都像給打昏了似地做着事情的。在小弄堂里，他彷彿受了驚似地發抖着。　　在黑黯中，喬治·韋拉特很機警地沿着小弄堂走去。溫斯堡商　的後門都還開着，他能够看到人們坐在燈光的下面。酒店老板娘威利太太站在馬波姆玩具商店的櫃機旁邊，她的手臂上掛着一隻籃子。侍候着她的，是夥計薛特。格利姆。他靠着櫃檯，很慇懃的說着話。　　喬治·韋拉特蹲伏着身子，一跳就跳過了那條從門口瀉出來的燈光。他開始在黑黯中跑着。在愛特·格利弗紫的酒店後向，那個鎭上的老醉鬼吉利·勃特，正睡熟在地上。他蹣跚地跨過那個醉漢仲出來的腿子，斷續地笑着。　　他已在開好一個冒險了。一整天他都試着下决心進行這個冒險，現在他已經着手。一直從六點鐘起，他都是坐在溫斯堡鷹報館的辦公室里想着這件事情。　　但他並沒有下過决。他只是一跳跳了起來，急急地走過正在排字房里從事校對的威爾。海得係，就沿着小弄堂跑去。　　喬治·韋拉特跑過一條街，又是一條街。他迥避着經過他身邊的人們。他接二連三的橫過許多街道。當他跑過一盞街燈的時候，他拉下了他的帽子，遮住面孔。他不敢思想。在他心上有一種恐怖，但那却是新鮮的。他生怕他已開始的冒險會受到阻碍，會因此失掉勇氣，而敗退下來。　　他發現露伊斯·脫　儂在她父親家里的廚房中。她靠近一盞煤油燈，正洗着碗碟。她站在那座小得像草棚似的，位在房子後部的廚房中的格子門後面。喬治·韋拉特靠着一道籬柵站住了，　力想止住身體的顫抖。只有一片馬鈴薯田把他從冒衛隔開。過了五分鐘以後，他才把得住自己下决心呌她。一露易斯！哦，露易斯！」他呌道。呌聲窒息在他的喉嚨里面，他的聲昔　成了沙嘎的低語。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言逢迎官吏  吹　　官吏，在專制時代則稱父母，在民國時代，則爲公僕，父母可以逢迎，而公僕則不必逢迎，但是政體雖改，而習慣猶存，不信請看近日豫省府的禁令，不但豫省如此，我想他省何嘗不如此。　　豫省府近以各縣紳民，逢迎官吏，往往造作虛飾之詞，爲現任縣長登報，歌功頌德，或建立德政碑，甚有縣府公務員，亦列名其中，希圖見好長官，每遇縣長更調，則假借名義，藉故挽留，實屬越權干凟，敗壞官常，特通令各縣，嚴行查禁。　　逢迎官吏，原是官紳間一種交際手叚，故逢迎官吏，未見得卽是惡劣行爲，惟第一個條件，便是官要好，紳亦要好，但是好官不易得，果好官，不要人家逢迎，而好紳亦不易得，果好紳，决不肯逢迎官吏，所以逢迎官吏，便是官紳間一種狼狽爲奸，欺上虐下的勾當。　　官假紳的力量來貪贓枉法，紳假官之威權來魚肉鄉民，因此官與紳便聯爲一氣，而地方遂蒙其大害，因爲官無紳以爲虎倀，則不敢爲非，紳無官以爲護符，亦不敢作惡，至官和紳聯爲一氣，則貪贓枉法，魚肉鄉民，乃無事不可爲矣，故孫總理要打倒土豪劣紳，剷除貧官汚吏，卽以此故，因爲紳則無官而不貪，紳則無官而不劣也。　　本來官之下只有民，民之上只有官，今於官民之間，另生一種階級，曰神，此何為科來哉，在滿淸時，有退隱之大員，有科甲之秀士，論其資格，則超越平民，論其官階，則全無職守，曰紳曰士，事或宜然。今爲民國時代，在職則爲官吏，退職卽爲平民，固無所謂紳也，今之所謂紳者，蠅營狗苟，勢燄董天，官不像官，民不像民，而包攬詞訟，魚肉鄉民，卽爲若輩專營之業務。　　民國以來，迄今幾年矣，若開士劣，則愈打而愈多，若謂貪官，則愈剷而愈甚，我國政治之所以不能淸明，地方秩序之所以日益腐化，卽以此故。於是現任官吏，而爲之歌功頌德者有之，將去官吏，而爲之建德政碑者有之，此種諂媚逢迎之情形，十足表現出官紳朋比爲奸的證擄，所以不將土劣衫本剷除，則貪官汚吏，决不絕跡，貪官汚吏旣不絕迹，而欲政治之淸明，安可得乎。東行草  流冰　　東京的住　　朋友，現在我要和你談到東京的住了。這一點，我擔保你如果來了也會覺得很有趣的，我們平時住慣了上海的中西合璧的房子，一旦跑到日本來看見這完全兩樣的房子，一定會感到興趣的，雖然，有時你也會感到諸多不便。　　我們都知道，日本是時常鬧地震和暴風的，所以除了銀行，百貨公司，機關辦事處和少數資本家的住宅外，都是木板造的矮房，屋項也因爲要减少危險起見，不用瓦而用洋鐵皮。這樣，卽使房子倒下來，也比磚瓦房子安全得多了。不過這種木房子，却能支掙百十年，因爲他們的木材堅固，雖經雨水也不會腐蝕。同時，居住的人都是小心翼翼的。他們的牆壁是用花紙糊成的，門扇是用一塊玻璃和薄紙糊成的，我們走到里面，把門扇關緊，那就四面紙壁找不到出路，其實是每一扇紙壁都是門。我們住在這里面，則非小心翼翼不可了，初來的時候，實在感到不慣，一不小心，墻壁便被弄穿一個洞。　　在房子里面，滿地都是鋪着蓆子，他們計算房子的大小，是以幾舖蓆爲單位的。房里空空如也。沒有檯凳和牀舖。有的，祇是沒一尺高的矮桌，那是吃飯時用的，讀書寫字也在這里呢。每個房子的墻壁上，都有「壁橱」，我們把一切箱子衣服被褥都放在里面，晚上睡覺時拿出來，平時把門關起來，便和墻壁一樣。房子里有些是有一個神壇的，日人奉之至敬，如果我們把屁股對着她坐，他們是不高興的。　　還有一樣使我們不慣的便是穿鞋子，一入屋門，便要把鞋子股掉固不必說，就是屋內也得穿好幾對拖鞋。因爲在房里有蓆子，當然是赤脚，一出房門的過道，便得穿拖鞋，比方我們從二樓到樓下的便所里，便得換三次拖鞋，下樓梯時一對，經過樓下飯堂時不能穿，過了飯堂又要另穿一對，進厠所門又得另換一對，實在不勝其麻煩，不過，不如此又不能保持室內的淸潔。　　在東京的中國留學生，住的地方有三種，卽下宿屋，貸間貨家。下宿屋是旅館之一種，一定要吃他的飯，普通每月要三十元左右，有下女服侍，對於經</p>

<p>濟不甚充裕的人是不上算的，但對於學日語則有很大益處。同時，祇要你每月把錢交淸，便可平安無事的一直住下去。住貸間呢，那就不同了，第一，你想租貸間就不容易，上等人家是不出租空房子的，中等人家，他是情願空下來不租給中國人。剩下來的祇有下等人家了。這些房子不是環境不好，便是房東太太很嚕囌。初來東京的人，尤為困難，因為自己不懂日語，雖然覺得不大滿意的房子，也還得受點氣，房東會上下打量你，向你盤問一切，甚至問你身上有沒有「南京蟲」。聽了這話，準得生氣。不過，到你搬進去後，她覺得你不會討厭，便會對你好起來，對你如家人一樣，偶有傷風之類的小毛病，她更看護周到，多方安慰你。比上海二永東的鐵板面孔又有天淵之別了。不受拘束的是住貨家了。市內貸家太貴，故普通都住在市外，每月祇要廿元左右，合三四人同住，實在便宜不過，但中國人是放縱不拘的，往往因為無拘束便午夜猶在呼盧一喝雉。縱使不這樣也因各有各的朋友，你來我往，很難得到美滿的結果。所以找不到情投意合的知交，住貸家也是不成功的。憂鬱的墟  樂筧　　淸早與午後，這個黃泥的曠塲上，翻着喧豗嘈雜的聲浪，熙攘着殷實質朴的人們，是一天裏最熱熱的鬧市呢。　　還是一個太古遺風的市集，搭着單篷單帳的小攤子特別多，擺設窳陋，據觀是「遊擊」式的生意，隨時可以遷徙，又隨時可以張起門面，在洪荒時代的社會裏，這種輕便的設計是再適宜也沒有了。也有不少的店家已經蓋起茅舍，簡陋得可以，牆壁上的三合土，一片片的剝落了；更有連整垜牆圍都坍塌了的，那一定是泥水匠偷工减料吧。　　時常可以看到幾個漢子抬着一條杉木，去擋住那些傾斜得似乎快壓下來的牆垜，或者碎碎地敲着鄒頭的響聲，淸脆地傳出它的回音；我更時常看見人家在牆壁的罅隙上釘起一張張的破蘆蓆子，抵擋風雨和陽光。在每次我看見他們這樣衰落的光景，我的心總沒來由地惆悵起來，而且着實佩服他們這種討求生活的忠實的態度。　　縱使每天有二個鬧市，這黃泥的曠塲上却始終是憂鬱的，使得一個不習於這種生活的人由好奇而彷徨。　　淸早，我總得踱出我的汚黑的屋子，踏着牛溲馬勃小徑到曠廣的屋外去散散步，嗅着高爽的空氣，同時便去作墟市的巡禮——熙攘的早市。　　肉攤上掛着血淋淋的猪頭，羊頭和牛尾，刀俎上放着一塊塊的牛肉，包蓋在白色的土布裏面，牛肉還在巍巍地顫動着，旁邊放着一把把的雪亮的刀。我意識着用這些銳利的刀上去切剖柔軟的牛肉，手下該會發生順利的快感吧。　　鷄販子那邊有人在光顧，而籠子肥肥的鷄給一根木棍撥東撥西，仔細地在選擇着，鷄販子瞪着兩隻眼睛看見主顧儘是撥，看上去有點惱怒了，把稱桿兒直往鷄籠上敲着，敲着。不知怎的，也許怎麼一個失手，一隻鷄子跳了出來，拐着兩桿矮矮的腿往曠塲中直奔過去，引吭長鳴着。　　兩個人捉鷄，許多人凑熱鬧，黃泥的灰塵飛揚起來。　鷄販子揑着一根竹竿，身子枸僂得像一把弓，與其說是捉鷄，勿寗說他是在打鷄，只是這麽一來，整個的墟市給哄動了，哄笑的聲浪更其喧豗了；但是不久便又沉寂下來，興奮的笑浪也收歛起來，偶然的過客有着依歇斯的里的心情吧。　　不時有着茶寮中的放肆的狂笑，咽嗚在沒有窗子的茅舍裏。　　於是走江湖的流浪人又來了，挑着一担黑色而古老的破箱，一大捆叉矛劍矢之類的武器，還抬來一雙古怪的甕子，止步在曠塲的中央，便擂起大鑼和皮鼓，長矛已經在舞。　　「殺子下甕，殺子下甕！來呀」一羣小孩子跌跌撞撞地集攏來，邊吶喊着；皮鼓擂得更起勁啦！　　我已經在這曠塲上楞住好久了，開始惘然地踏上一條牛溲馬勃的小徑走回家去，心頭不禁地沉悶而惆悵。　　「憂鬱的墟！憂鬱的墟！」木排上  雷鐵鳴　　我在流着的木排上過了一夜。…………　　夕陽老早沉下海底了，廣寂的海面上，微紅的殘霞也漸漸失了光彩，把海天交接的水色染成一片暮黑。　　潮水是靜靜地，微笑地流動着，不停地向着東面退下去。　　木排數不淸有多少，三個木排繫做一段，每隔五六丈又是一段，每段木排上立着兩個馬來人。他們用長長的手竿慢慢地撑着，木排囌囌地順着流水流下去，漸漸消隱在疏遠的叢林背後了。　　我跳上去的木排上，撑手一個是年紀很靑的某智，另一個是高興喝酒的阿馬才；他這時寡言地把竹竿擱在他的肩膀上，用力推着。　　「當心，小港裏如果水淺還要過夜的。」　　基智豎起結實的黑背膊，一邊拔着竹竿一邊這樣說；接着他泛起飽歷風雨的眼簾，對我斜視了一下。　　「潮水不會退的這樣快的。」我說　　我們的木排入了小港了，小港兩旁的樹木和蔓草，好像故意把港身逼的更狹似地，水只有五尺多深，然而有聲音地急流着。……　　夜，六月的風從疎疎的樹林間吹過來，落葉唦唦她掉在水上，木排上。　　阿馬才把酒瓶做的土油燈點着了，烟霧濃臭地薰縈着，橙黃色的火光，照出了木排上每個人瘦黑的臉孔。　　我們任木排自己流着，回頭把最後的半鍋冷飯擺出來，微笑地圍坐着，用洗過的手指抓了吃。用樹枝挾着一串串的鹹魚，上面塗着醬油和辣椒，放在火爐邊吱吱地燒着。　　一段段木排的行列，長蛇般地被急流逐着流下去。……　　這些木排都是從森林裏採來的，馬來工人不止息地撑着，經過很長的婉曲的山溪，然後流進這平靜的海面上。他們在沙灘上過宿，在木排上受那雨淋日曝，祇是日日夜夜地流着，恒久地勞動着，直到把一個個的木排安全地撑到木廠裏去。　　港水灣灣曲曲地狹流着，比先前更淺而且更急了。木排碰到岸邊的野草上，野草發出哀叫地倒下去，兩岸上的樹枝矮矮地互相交錯着，黑黓的港身好像一個深淵的山洞。　　前後木排上的火光被樹林遮住，互相看不見了，耳朶只聽見不斷的撑竿聲，以及稀散的低聲說話聲。　　「喂，到了哩！」……　　喊聲從前面木排上傳來，一直又傳到最末的一段去。小港裏溢蕩着歡笑和歌聲，勞動快樂地念促起來了，森林中的每個黑暗的角落裏，好像都漏出了悅耳的進行曲。　　「哈哈，到了吧」……　　「基智，天快亮了吧！」　　我高興的幾乎流下淚來。熱風在樹梢頭輕輕地嘯着，酒瓶嘴上吐出的火焰亂搖了，水面上湧起晶亮的一片波光。交班回來  中華獨立美術協會展  德敏　　中華獨立美術協會十月十日起假座金神父路中華學藝社舉行畫展，我把整天的時間都消費在會塲中，我以為我每一次看一幅作品能得作一種新印象時是不應該離開會塲——至少還要在他們作品滋味之中去嘗滋味。每次我看一個畫展時都是這麽想，不過事實上很少有如獨展般的能給我重味的新感覺和印象來。一張作品的價值是在時代新鮮感覺和思想上，樣式，色彩，也是重要，他們很能注意到這些條件，所以他們的作品能成為我精神而非表現的作品，在作風和主義的立塲上，他們每個人均已獻了他們不同的本能，例如梁錫鴻用色，線，搆圖方面的變形，能使他那野獸派的畫中增加了表現力！例如他的線和色的變化生出了畫面的律動來，這律動使一幅畫有生氣，有情感的了。他的「梅花」「熱河風景」等都很能使我滿意？　　李東平之作品則又是一種特色的表現法了，「航桅」，「海濱之賣花女」「輪」等都是傑作，在搆圖設色方面都很好。一個畫家對主題的扱取是沒有什麽關係的，就看李君對航海，和日常生活的題材能散文詩化這就是作家特有的好處。新野獸主義精神充分地在他的畫面流露着。　　妹尾正彥，高岡德太郎這二氏的作品都很有重質的感覺，妹尾氏之「少年像」「裸婦」油畫的表現力很充分地具有了，同時在色彩的變化上也好，樫本勵的作品可以說在堅實中帶有幽雅的成份　　曾鳴氏之大作「風景中之裸婦」「柘榴」「靜物」都是在筆上下對縱橫藝術問題提出的結果，所以在立體的上面，抒情詩上面，均帶有超現實詩歌薰良的雰圍。是一種幻象的寫實性。趙獸君之「魚」「靜物」「步行者」等都好。他的畫可說是視覺寫實性而超現實主義者，所一以他的主題還是現實的，不過在這實現一中求到了畫而的現實性的形變來，白霜的作品還好。鄭思實的風景頗帶有法國的精神。其他的出品畫中作品均很好。　　我以為獨立展才在一九三五年的出現很可以為現代中國死沉的洋畫壇來劃分一個新的時期，他們的精神方面能接合現代之思潮，這在開倒車的中國藝壇能有這新的洗刷，這些新問題的提出，對將來的中國藝壇是有很大影響的。播音節目歌曲介紹　　災民苦　　天連水，水連天，滔滔洪水渺無邊堤岸冲毀無阻抑，廬舍村廓悉被淹。夜深水至逃不及，老幼弱小皆魚籠，攀樹縣牆幸避免，俯視茫茫心如煎。心如煎，心如煎，誰來救我飢與溺？田禾漂沒食糧盡，嗷嗷待哺如飢燕。樹皮草根聊果腹，風餐露宿無棲息；賣兒鬻女難過活，一家骨肉生離別！　　生離別，生離別，他鄕迄食無親戚，千山萬水儘奔波，無衣無食有誰憐。秋去冬來天氣凉，奄奄垂斃存一息。災民之苦苦黃連，不怨洪水怨倉天！特別節目　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時至六時　　三潭印月（前奏曲）蘇武牧羊（斐君）從軍別愛（陳萍）賣花詞（瑛瑛）摩登戀愛（沈瑛）鋤頭舞歌（珂玲）好朋友來了（沈玲）（兪徵）夜園裏（陳萍）寒衣曲（瑛瑛）漂泊者（柴瑟）（陳萍）追求（沈瑛）船夫曲（全體）歌唱　　時代歌劇播音社　　佛音（九八〇）下午五時至五時三刻　　小小茉莉（芳蘭）夜深深（林鶯）蘇三不要哭（芳蘭）醉臥沙塲（林鶯）擱樓上小姐（王琪）離別了姑娘（叔牙）鐵馬金戈曲（王琪）諾波城之夜（劍魂）話劇　　楊貴妃　六時半至七時一刻　　民衆的呼聲，的確是偉大的，終於是逼着唐玄宗把楊貴妃犧牲了！一紋，二紋，三紋，亂國的美人，就此殞命了。　　美玲團　　富星（九二〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　你的一笑（綠茵）賣花詢（佩佩）催眠曲（程瑩）摩登女郎（靜美）春深了（英英）警鐘（佩佩）春宵曲（綠茵）母親（賴玲）　　玫瑰團　　東方（一〇二〇）下午六時十分　　到春來（前奏）和平歌（曼麗）倚江樓（若吳）人間仙子（文仙）花生米（玲玲）節儉歌（英英）人生幾回逢（曼麗）人面桃花（琰莉）　　上海（一一〇〇）下午七時三十分　　叮叮噹（前奏）今夜曲（文仙）說愛就愛（周恭若英）你要誰抱（玲玲）落花流水（英英）安慰（曼麗）楊柳絲絲（文仙）桃李爭春（若英）　　利利（一二四〇）下午十時十分　　樂哉（前奏）雙搖舟（琰英文仙）燕子樓（琰琍）月亮亮（玲玲）飛花歌（瑛瑛）愛情是什麼（曼麗）因為你太美（若英）快樂家庭（文仙）　　上海歌劇社　　新新（七八〇）下午七時至八時　　愛如花月（周璇）太年花（周潔）浮雲掩月（徐健）心琴曲（黃韻）紅燒丈失（黃韻）我的愛人就是你（徐健）妹妹我怪你（周潔）走近前來（周璇）　　李樹德堂（九四〇）下午九時至十時　　送郎歌（周璇）娘子軍（周潔）夜花園裏（徐健）恭賀新禧（黃韻）謝謝你的口香糖（黃韻）可憐秋香（徐健）我願意（周潔）雙星曲（周璇）　　丁香社　　利利（一二四〇）下午七時一刻至八時　　瞎子瞎算命（綠茵）蝶戀花（姚莉）醉臥沙塲（鄭霞）燕帶春來（麗亞）蕩婦曲（綠茵）燕燕（鄭霞）燕雙飛（麗亞）鴛鴦怨（姚莉）　　東陸（六四〇）下午八時至八時三刻　　口香糖（兪月明）擱樓上小姐（姚英）鴻雁寄相思（綠茵）睡的贊美（姚莉）警鐘（綠茵）知音之愛（姚英）鐵馬金戈（俞月明）好時光（姚莉（文璧）　　大上海社　　華美（一〇六〇）下午九時至十時　　淞花江（前奏曲）吹泡泡（王琪）夜月之歌（飛亞）丁香山（飛虹）歸程（莫　）人面桃花王琪）峨眉月（飛亞）擱樓小姐（飛虹）彈詞　　潘心伊黃陸緣　　李樹德（九四〇）中午三刻至一時三刻　　開篇「八仙失道」　　上海地方景物優。南京路上鬧啁啁。垂頭喪氣的張果老。纔到申江就觸煤頭。心切切。恨悠悠。銀幣要罰兩大圓。丟却驢子充抵押。巡捕房中暫拘留。唱道情。費計謀。一家家。苦苦求。被人輕視貽人羞。小夥計。丟出銅板的溜圓。說道窮道士莫再話咻咻。心上急。胸上憂。忽聞短笛價口吹。踽踽而來韓湘子。見張仙急忙問情由。始末根底細訴說。還問那六位仙長在何處遊。答道是在大中華的六層樓。為道兄正在十分愁。呂純陽。只會點石成金子。有法變不出大袁頭。在上海。有錢即是神仙客。沒錢還如死人般。小弟是末福建路上纔經過。見家家店舖被魔纏。白日靑天興妖怪。是神是鬼看不穿。左右無聊去觀一觀。為金錢暫去把妖搜。張仙聞聽心歡喜。並着同行步緩緩。忽聽得軋軋機身飛空際。大蜻蜓一只在雲端。路上行人齊仰視。張韓兩仙也抬頭。道旁人。笑語喧。說道中國自造的大飛船。韓湘子不解飛機意。分明是法寳臨空向上丟。行行向前無多步。福建路三字在眼底收。張果老。起爆頭。韓道兄法力果無儔。你使那費長房縮地的神行術。關山萬里一瞬眸。上海已到福建路。此

<p>申報本埠增刊　汽車周刊日擬投資於外商在日汽車事業  虞　　政府已將法案通過美國朝野深為注意　　日本的汽車事業。近年來已有長足的進步。雖然產量不多。而它的意義却是很重要的。政府方面除了投資和予製造廠以種種便利外。還打算施行一種保護這種新興工業的方法。關於這一點。比較的最受影響而格外注意的要算美國了。美國的執世界汽車製造的牛耳。這是早已名震遐邇。無庸紹介的了。可是它對於日本有什麼關係呢。要曉得日太是一個工業國家。重工業雖不見得怎樣能和歐美媲美。但是它的輕工業。却是不可一世的。因為工業商業及運輸軍事上的需要。美國汽車就在那裏獲得一個很大的市塲。以一個汽車產量最多的美國。和一個需要最殷的日本。在這般情况之下。日本當局忽然有統制汽車事業的决議。無怪美國朝野一體注意了。　　講到保護和統制國內汽車事業。原不是日本獨有的事。目下像法蘭西。日耳曼。和意大利等。他們早就注意到這點。用政令來主持一切。他如西班牙也巳在計議這種保護方法。至於英國的國內生產管理權也早已有大半在不列顛人自己手中。自從日本政府有了這種具體决定以後。華盛頓商務部當局便召集有關人員。加以深切的研究。據分析的結果。得知這種法律實行之後。將要叫在日本的汽車工廠。其百分之五十一的資本是要操於日人自己手中的。這明明說大多數的投資要日本人自己來。至於實權何在。那更不用細說了。　　雖然日本汽車市塲中。美國汽車所佔的優勢。其詳細情形不得而知。可是大家知道在日本註冊的汽車。其總數百分之九十是美國車子。美國汽車在日本的貿易總額每年大概在美金一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元至一四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元之間。就單拿束京一地來說。各種登記的汽車中。百分之九十五是屬於美國牌子的。除美國之外。別的外國在日本的汽車貿易為數有限。一九三四年時。英國出售於日本的計客車二百六十七輛。運貨汽車五十二輛。德國祇銷了三輛客車。和一輛運貨汽車。可是在這同年中。美國出口裝得日本的現成汽車。客車計有九千六百三十三輛。運貨汽車九千八百三十七輛。價值約近美金七·八〇〇·〇〇〇元。除此之外。裝配的汽軍零件。價值美金四·〇八八·二六六元。這些零件至少可裝就四〇〇輛的汽軍。所以有在去年中。美國銷到日本的汽車。其總數實不下二三·〇〇〇輛。至於在日本的美車總銷數如何。一時無從查考。不過看了一九三五年七月一日的汽車登記一一九·八一二的數目。和東京百分之九十六為美車的可靠事實。可以見得美車在日本的銷路一年將達三〇·〇〇〇輛之譜了。　　日本自身的汽車製造業。目下尙屬發軔時期。有一種「大津雲的客車。常年銷售數不到五〇〇輛。還有幾種運貨汽車也是日本人自己製造的。可是除了軍用之外。銷路和產量。兩不旺盛。依照東京的汽車登記數量來說。每十二輛登記汽車中。祇有一輛是屬於日本製造的。從美國進口的汽車。在日本獨操了市塲。福特和通用兩廠。在日本都沒有裝配廠。不過除了風屏玻璃及熱舖等外。差不多沒有一樣不是從美國進口的。這些廠的資產都是屬於美人的。直到目前還沒有外資投入。至於現在所計議中的新法律。將要如何的影響現局面。一時也無從說起。譬如克雷斯勒的順連牌。在日本的銷路很大。可是它在出口之前。已在美國裝配成全了。所以日本人如果要投資的話。祗有在銷售方面着想。在生產方面是無從揷足的。福特和通用兩廠。因為裝配的工作。和一部原料品在日本採集。如果新法律實行起見。恐怕日本資金的投入是免不了的哩。汽車用狄塞爾引擎發展史（三）  朱義生　　歐戰開始。各國競相製造狄塞爾引擎用為潛水艇發動機。迨歐戰停止後。經過幾個時期的發展。由小型而至大型。各國商輪頗有競相裝用的趨勢。直至近今數年。因世界不景氣的關係。人們方纔想到運用比較經濟的狄塞爾引擎於汽車及飛機上。　　狄寨爾引擎究竟是什樣經濟，試舉例如左。　　在美國太平洋之濱。有一家運貨公司。將他的四部卡車換用狄塞爾引擎。結果是每月省去購油費二千美金。汽油在美國每介倫價洋一角九分。而重油則祗需六分。幾一與三之比。另一家運輸公司置有狄塞爾卡車二十一輛。後因其經濟耐用將省下的錢再添購五十輛。行駛老聖及至弗來司諾間每次可省油價五十元。每行駛十英里用油一介倫。如用汽油則每介倫祇能走四英里。其省可知　　看到了上列美滿的成績。有一家公司在去年二月本置有一百輛者。至十一月底突增加至一千輛。有一家機器廠家在一九三一年所造大小引擎。總共馬力社一〇五六匹。而去年竟超升到二十三萬七千餘匹。還有一家出品各式汽車。經廣銷之下。每月所走里程超過四百萬英里。在一九三一年英國共有狄塞爾公共汽車二十五輛。今日他的數目已達六千輛有奇。而全國運貨卡車亦已什九改用狄寨爾引擎。上海公共租界載客汽車近來亦多改用狄塞爾引擎。又歐州某大狄塞爾引擎製造廠。去年十二個月內。製造之汽車消耗重油有兩千五百萬介倫之鉅。　　沒有幾時前。一家法國汽車廠聲稱已造成十匹馬力小狄塞爾汽車一輛。該車耗油量之節省眞無以復加。據說每一分錢之油可走十英里。　　狄塞爾引擎的比較經濟。非但是因油價賤的關係。最重要者厥為量的方面。將來一旦盛行。勢必至於引起重油的加稅及加價等問題。以挽回汽油的銷路。然而狄塞爾引擎內在的效率。仍舊可以維持他的優勢。　　美國狄塞爾引擎製造的先進者允推印第安那州哥倫布城之克敏斯先生。他所註冊專利的一種量油器。可以將定量的油每週注射於汽筒內。此種發明可使引擎的走動和順如意。不生顫動。　　克敏斯氏在一九三一年特造一輛狄塞爾跑車加入印第安那州賽車塲競賽。一口氣跑了五百英里。用油三十一介倫。結果跑第十三名。去年再度加入跑第十二名。今年他同一名愛文斯者在弗老利大州的海灘上。比賽結果。他的狄塞爾汽車得到每句鐘一百三十七英里的紀錄。而愛文斯的每小時祇行一百二十五英里。　　狄塞爾引擎之經久耐用。可於一九三三年之冬季證明之。那時有一輛克敏斯式的運貨狄塞爾卡車。在印第安那州賽車廣塲上繼續行駛一萬四千六百英里。並未停止。而在起初的一萬英里內。亦無需加油。此後那同一的引擎換裝於一萬七千確重量之卡車上。從紐約至老聖及。歷程三千餘英里。用去時間九十七小時。耗油祇值美金十一元。約合每十英里用油洋一分。此外那克敏斯式狄塞爾引擎。還握有公共汽車穿越美洲的紀錄。在一九三二年。那引擎拖動一輛十噸半重的公共汽車。從紐約橫斷美洲而至老聖及。費時七十八小時。平均每一小時行駛四十英里。總共耗去油費美金二十二元。　　非但在公路上如此。卽鋼軌上狄塞爾引擎已顯出有改造歷史之可能性。美國勃林登鐵路之齊飛式狄塞爾引擎車頭。裝置六百六十匹馬力文登引擎。每句鐘速率達一百十二英里。將原來芝加哥至唐物之行駛時間削去一半。此等車頭均屬流綫型。　　瑞士某鐵道嘗於一九一一年造成狄寨爾引擎車頭一具。狄塞爾引擎之用以拖動列車可以此為鵠始。浙北汽車旅行記（中）  凌雲　　自渡船（速度表五，〇〇二）可望見新橋之建築。甚為淸晰。在河中游泳一過。於下午二時半出發。兩英里之路程後。卽達淳安。購汽油五加侖。在五〇〇八—二〇之途程中路面劣而危險。業已在修理之中。途中得見錢塘江之偉觀。一路景色。有若干處極佳。及至威坪。（五，〇二一）據公路汽車站中人語。自此前進。因連日大雨後。路面塌坍。不能行車。至其將於何時修理完竣。則余等勢必在此守候。以待其他汽車行旅者之訊息。此地宜連帶一述者。卽車上所裝用之鄧祿普輪胎。全程中所遇之困難。僅於此時被兩釘刺穿。破洞於淳安費一小時之時間。大洋一元之代價。修繕完好。在此種長途行程中。良好之車輪胎。實屬重要。因往往遇到一英里之路面。盡係尖銳燧石。被秋陽所炙。熱度極高。每晨檢視輪胎時。宜將氣壓略為增高。以策安全。　　星期日晨六時。離淳安出發。速度表為五，〇四〇。五分後達第二渡頭。但須重返淳安購買渡稟。在江邊早膳後。乃於六時五十分前進。速度表五，〇六三時到達重要之交叉地點。名為白沙，向右行。另付渡資一元。乃過錢塘（其時間為上午八時十分。里行五，〇六九）。錢塘江之南邊。路面良好多多。所見樹木。亦較已往為密。里程五，〇七八時卽達壽昌。向左行經一小谷。據高而望。得見小白屋若干乃為巖居者所住。其後車入平原。環繞皆山。菓園衆多。令人有置身甘德之惠爾特想也。　　經行此間時。令人生有一種感想。即車行縱不必甚速。而良好喇叭之重要。乃為一刻所不容或缺者。此地又遇一意外之事。為極富於危險性者。蓋有若千小童。見汽車經過。擲以巨大之石。高呼取樂。所幸駕駛座前之保險玻璃未為擊破耳。蘭谿位於錢塘江支流蘭谿江邊。其城頗不狹小。地上亦異常肥沃。於上午九時四十分到達。（里程五，一〇〇）在此公路車站以每加侖一元一角之代價。購汽油十磅。回溯原路半英里後。到達往渡頭之支路。驟視之下。此路殊難通行。須由路之一邊下降。爬行而升至他邊。方得通衍。蓋因路基全被冲毀也。余等乃返至車站。詢問有否誤入歧途。路不之凹窩。角度甚為峻峭。車尾板翼。竟為括損。兩英里後抵渡舟處。船製以木。打漿乃進。收費之處在英里前之蘭谿南車站。其路面之劣。與未抵渡頭前相同。其左可見飛機備用塲。　　自蘭谿南車站至金華之十九英里途程中。當速度表指五，一一〇時。忽遭遇一意外之事。苟非所裝之塞車特別可靠。此行殆當從此中止。蓋當前進之時。前面未見有若何之通知或警告。路忽中斷。下塌十五尺而至溪水。其後據稱六月杪時大雨為災。全路路基咸遭毀損。在此兩個月中。已有多車陷落溪中。鄉人等於救車出險之時。似已獲得不少之利潤矣。因此余等不得已而回返南車站。以一元購渡江之票。游泳稍息後於十二時半出發（五，一一六）。下午一，時三十分抵白沙渡口。里程五，一四八。一小時後。里程為五，一八六。在桐廬作全日中第六次之擺渡。三時二十五分在山邊進茗。高矚桐廬。精神為之一爽。乃以五十八英里之途程而向杭州西湖進發一下午五出半到達。回顧此二日半中。所經過之路程巳達五百英里。此華克斯好車並未有若何之障碍發生。所引為憾事者。僅因道路中斷。第一次不能往徽州，第二次不能取道金華往溫州而已。汽車瀛談  虞　　英汽車出口值增進　今年開首六個月中。英國之全部汽車出口業。包括各種汽車車輛。機器脚踏車及三輪摩托車。各式零件及輪胎等。其總值為英金八，〇五九，五九二鎊。同時進口至英之汽軍等為值英金二，一六五，三一三鎊。出入相抵之後。出起五，八九四，二七九鎊。六個月中出口之汽車商用運貨車及零件。出口較進口之同類價值超過三，七七三，一六三鎊。若單以汽車一項而論。則此時期中。出超之價值為英金一，四二九，〇九八鎊。今年六月份較之一九三四年同月。出口之汽車商用汽車及零件。增進九六，〇五〇鎊。六個月來增進四〇七，〇七三鎊。汽車一項之出口值六月份計增進八五，〇二六鎊。半年中共增三五七，二四一鎊。下列之計數為六個月來。由英出口至各地市塲之增進及低减狀况。增進者。計英屬印度六七，九三二鎊。英屬馬來亞一〇八，四八五鎊。錫蘭一六，八〇八鎊。紐絲倫一八四，〇五二鎊。其他英屬五四，八〇〇鎊。其他外國一五六，三九六鎊。减低者。計愛爾蘭自由邦一七一，五四五鎊。海峽羣島三七鎊。南菲聯邦三七，九九三鎊。荷蘭一六，五六七鎊。西班牙四，七三六鎊。舊汽車之由英輸出者。六個月時期中計增進三七，六二一鎊。汽車商用運貨汽車及其零件之進值。今年六月份與去年同時相較。計减低四八，六〇七鎊。但半年來則增進七六五，七三二鎊。六月份之私用車出口减少二七，六四七鎊。但六個月來增進六八五，八五四鎊。其中頗堪令人注意者。卽六月份由美輸英之汽車减低四八，〇九一鎊。但半年來增進一九〇，六五八鎊。一週間汽車肇禍記  三原　　日期　地址　汽車號碼　受傷人　傷勢　最後情形　　十六日　霞飛路　兩車互撞　徐　松　重傷身死　假查核辦　　十七晶　武昌路　某號　陳金和　重傷身死　車主出資殮　　十八日　江灣路　一一四三〇　戴豐祥　重傷腹部　拘車夫法辦　　十九日　烏鎭路　兩車互撞　何步雲　輕傷　送院醫院　　二十日　軍工路　搬塲汽車　男子三人　仝右　　廿一日　寳山路　某號　湯金生　輕傷　仝右　　廿二日　愛多亞路　兩車互撞　諸和生　輕傷　仝右　　本週間之汽車肇禍。共有七起。內因重傷身死者。計男子二人。重傷者。計男子四人。輕傷者。計男子三人云。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Italo-Ethiopian Peace Talks: French Cabinet Satisfied with Progress; British and Italian Continued Negotiations in Rome; Italian Side States Only Explanation Provided, No Concrete Suggestions Made <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a meeting this morning at 9:30 AM, which adjourned at 12:10 PM. A public announcement stated that Premier Laval had reported on the negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy regarding a solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The cabinet unanimously expressed its support and satisfaction with the improved situation in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Laval is now facing a crucial moment to test his ability to mediate international affairs. He plans to make efforts to reconcile the East African conflict before the League of Nations' Committee of Fifty-Two reconvenes in Geneva on October 31st. However, the full authority granted to Laval by the Chamber of Deputies upon his assumption of the premiership will also expire on October 31st, compounding his domestic difficulties at a time of international crisis. (Guomin News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) A political spokesperson told a Reuters reporter that the ongoing diplomatic talks are of a general nature. Their purpose is merely to explain everything, and there is no question of proposing concrete suggestions for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich met with British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond yesterday afternoon. According to official sources, the purpose of the meeting was to exchange views on major issues, and no new suggestions were made. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally believed here today that the easing of Anglo-Italian relations may lead to Italo-Ethiopian peace. Observers believe that the atmosphere in Europe has changed. The League of Nations' Committee of Fifty-Two will suspend its meeting until October 31st to allow diplomats to conduct peace talks before a date is set for a complete embargo on war materials. (Guomin News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources here today, Prime Minister Mussolini is prepared to begin negotiations on a "fundamental solution" to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. However, Mussolini will not agree to discuss until Britain reduces its Mediterranean fleet and ceases its hostile attitude in Geneva. Another reliable source said today that Mussolini needs the following three points to be addressed before negotiations can proceed: (1) the British fleet withdraws from the Mediterranean; (2) the League of Nations suspends economic sanctions; and (3) Italy is allowed to "consolidate" the land it has already occupied in Ethiopia. It is understood that the meaning of the third item is that Italy hopes to have occupied all of Ethiopia's low-lying areas by the time negotiations begin. (Guomin News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures believe that negotiations on the Abyssinian question are currently underway, but this issue is extremely complex and may be difficult to resolve in the shortest amount of time. It is reported that the minimum conditions for resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute proposed by the Italian government have been deemed unsatisfactory by Britain and France and have been rejected. However, semi-official sources believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now considering the objections of Britain and France and may soon make new suggestions. Semi-official sources also hope that negotiations can continue, but they believe that a solution may not be possible within the year, as any solution must be approved by the Ethiopian Emperor and deemed satisfactory by the League of Nations. Britain's role is merely to convey information. The power of final decision still rests with the League of Nations' Council. However, given the current situation, the gradual implementation of sanctions by the League of Nations may force Italy to gradually reduce its demands. As for the League of Nations, it will certainly be happy to accept any plan agreed upon by Britain, France, and Ethiopia. Rumors of secret negotiations between the Italian and Ethiopian governments suggest that Mussolini has not forgotten the Ethiopian Emperor. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations today sent letters to eleven non-member countries, including the United States, Germany, Japan, and Brazil, informing them of the resolution to implement financial and economic sanctions against Italy and asking them to participate in unison. The Secretariat also received notifications today from Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Norway, and Turkey that they have imposed an arms embargo on Italy. In total, 23 countries have now taken this action. Belgium also stated that financial sanctions have been implemented. (Guomin News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: At dawn today, an advance force of 1,500 members of the Imperial Guard departed from here, traveling 150 miles to Taixi. The send-off was a grand occasion. They will be divided into small teams, advancing on three routes to reach their destination. The soldiers of the Imperial Guard are all physically robust and dressed like British soldiers, but all are barefoot, as wearing shoes would reduce their speed. The entire army consists of 12,000 men, including 3,000 cavalry. At midday, they all gathered on the mountain peaks overlooking Addis Ababa, then divided into two columns. One marched toward Taixi, which will be the main base of the northern Ethiopian army, and the other headed to Gogam, directly north of Addis Ababa. Their wives and lovers accompanied them up the mountain peaks, waving their handkerchiefs until the troops were out of sight. Supplies needed by the army, such as mules, machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, medicines, emergency rations, and mobile battlefield wireless equipment, were transported in batches. Italian planes have now flown within 80 miles of Addis Ababa, so the departure of troops and supplies is divided into small batches to prevent enemy aircraft from hindering them. The departure of the Imperial Guard from Addis Ababa is widely seen as a precursor to the Emperor's imminent departure for the front lines. The Emperor will depart by car or truck, accompanied by a large entourage. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: All evidence suggests that Ethiopia is preparing a general offensive. Thousands of elite infantry, including the guards, left for the front lines today. This indicates that a major battle in the north is imminent. The Emperor's pardon of former Minister of Land Yirbiru, who embezzled public funds, proves that the Ethiopian government is now striving to eliminate internal strife and unite all factions to resist the Italian invasion. General Seyoum, commander of the Northern Army and governor of Tigray Province, which is resisting the Italian Eritrean enemy forces, reported his military plans to the Emperor by telephone today. It is said that Seyoum advocates testing the military strength in the northeast. The rumor that the Ethiopian government is borrowing a huge sum of 2 million pounds from Britain is still very strong today. Well-informed observers believe that efforts are now being made to secure the supply of arms to Ethiopian troops in the war zone. A large amount of arms is stored in the Dara Sarah area south of the capital, indicating that the Ethiopian army is preparing to attack the Italian army from the west of the Shibeli River. Tribal infighting is making things difficult for the Emperor. (Guomin News Agency, 21st)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: According to a telegram from our correspondent O'Chaina, former Minister of Land Yirbiru (cousin of former Emperor Menelik), who was condemned two years ago for disobeying the Emperor's orders, has been pardoned. Since leaving office, Yirbiru has been living in seclusion on his farm in the city of Adusa. Although the Emperor recently summoned him to the capital, he was unable to make the trip due to illness. Now, with the foreign invasion imminent, the whole country is united to resist the powerful enemy. All subjects are supporting the Emperor, and even criminals have been pardoned by the Emperor to strengthen national defense. Yirbiru is one of them. He led his family and servants to the palace yesterday, prostrated himself, and, according to traditional custom, murmured "Abyabyabi" (meaning "forgive me"). After entering the palace, he crawled forward on his knees. Only after the Emperor issued an edict of pardon did he stand up. The Emperor immediately ordered him to rejoin the army and serve the country. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Under Cover of Aircraft and Artillery: Italian Army Occupies Dagneri, Ethiopian Army Fights Bravely, Heavy Losses <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday's Italian announcement that the Italian non-regular army had occupied the town of Dagneri on the Ogaden front has partially dispelled the doubts surrounding the southern Ethiopian campaign led by General Graziani, Governor of Italian Somaliland. According to this news, the southern Italian front is not as close to Harar as initially expected. The front line stretches from Domo on the border of British Somaliland, through the famous watering hole Gerlogubi, to Dolo on the border of British Kenya. Dagneri is an important high point located on a 600-foot mountain. Ethiopian forces had heavily fortified it and stored a large amount of ammunition there. At dawn on October 18, the Italian army began its attack, first with ten aircraft bombing the area, followed by machine guns strafing Ethiopian positions. Five aircraft were hit by Ethiopian soldiers, but all returned safely. The infantry attack was carried out by Somali and Asgari troops, surging forward like an angry tide, aided by members of the Kelaldingis tribe, who had recently surrendered to the Italian army. On the same day, the Italian army bombed Burdoli, 50 miles northwest of Mustahil, setting it on fire and occupying Soillave, which is especially important because it is a fertile pastureland in a semi-desert environment. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Southern Italian Front: Indigenous troops from the Italian territories under the command of General Graziani advanced today in the Ogaden province after the most intense fighting since the start of the conflict. All reports indicate victory. Italian troops suffered fewer casualties, while Ethiopian troops suffered heavy losses. The battle was quite spectacular, but perhaps not too bloody, as the Italian side relied entirely on the power of aircraft and artillery. An Associated Press reporter witnessed the entire battle. It began at dawn last Wednesday, when Italian Dubat troops suddenly attacked the heavily guarded Douboli Fortress. A second force set out from Mustahil and crossed the Shibeli River on Friday morning, advancing in the face of Ethiopian gunfire and spears. Dagneri is a mountain peak overlooking the Shibeli River and is also heavily guarded. The Italian army began bombing it at 2 PM on Saturday. On Monday, Dubat troops began climbing the hillside, led by aircraft that strafed Ethiopian trenches with machine guns. The two sides fought hand-to-hand on the mountaintop for several hours before the Ethiopian army retreated. (Guomin News Agency, 21st)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: Since the surrender of Kufsa to the Italian army, telephone communication between Addis Ababa and the northern front has been cut off. It was only restored today. General Seyoum, who is defending against the Italian army in the Aduwa region, reported to the Emperor by telephone that the Italian army has moved its vanguard back and is now consolidating its positions south of the line connecting Axum, Aduwa, and Adigrat. In the past few days, it was widely rumored that the Italian army's outposts were advancing towards the city of Mek'ele, but this has now been proven to be inaccurate. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

Sixteen thousand men left for the front lines at the end of last week. There are still twenty ships in Naples loading troops. The war against Ethiopia is costing Italy a lot of money. According to an announcement by the Italian Ministry of Finance last night, more than 22 million pounds in British gold were spent in the three months before the war alone. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) When British Foreign Secretary Hoare began his speech in the House of Commons this afternoon to report on the international situation, he praised the achievements of the late Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference. He continued, "Problems so urgent, unpleasant, and dangerous as those we face today are unprecedented. British policy has remained unchanged. This is the policy of the British Parliament and the majority of the people of Britain and the Dominions. Outsiders do not understand Britain's sincerity in the new order of international relations and underestimate Britain's efforts to uphold the League of Nations as an impartial instrument of justice. The British government sees the League of Nations as a bridge connecting the United States and Europe. If this bridge is broken, Britain will find cooperation with the European continent difficult and dangerous. The League of Nations has never shown its vibrancy as it does today. We have never used the current dispute as an opportunity to attack Fascism. We have never wanted to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. We fulfill our responsibilities in Geneva with the sole purpose of upholding the principles of the League Covenant. Some say that economic sanctions against Italy will eventually lead to war. This is a misconception. He believes that if countries collectively implement economic sanctions, the Italo-Ethiopian war will definitely be shortened. Italy would never be so foolish as to attack a single country. If it does, Britain, France, and other members of the League of Nations will unite and resist with full solidarity. Britain has not wanted to take unilateral action since the beginning of the discussions in Geneva. Military sanctions have never been discussed. There is no such plan in British policy. He does not believe that anyone in Europe wants war now. Britain has never proposed to France the consideration of military sanctions against Italy. There is already too much inflammable material in Europe, which is worrying everywhere. He has never taken a biased attitude. Apart from Italy, he was the first to remind the world of the requirements for Italy's development and economic security." The Foreign Secretary concluded by asking, "Is there no way to reach a solution that would make the policy of economic sanctions against an old friend unnecessary?" (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons reconvened at 2:45 PM this afternoon in an atmosphere of excitement. The visitor's gallery was full, and members of the cabinet and opposition leaders were all present. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The British Parliament is scheduled to reconvene today, the last meeting before the general election. Many people will participate in the debate when discussing the international situation today.

<p>(Beiping) Two thousand villagers from four villages in Xianghe County, 100 miles southeast of Pingdong, protested against the county government's additional 30% surcharge on land taxes. On the 20th, they gathered and took up weapons and firearms, marching in groups to petition the county government. On the 21st, they clashed with the county government's defense corps. The county was surrounded, and the county magistrate is still trapped in the city. This morning, the rioters have not yet retreated. After receiving the report, the provincial government has ordered local military police to pay attention to prevention. If the situation escalates further, they will dispatch strong troops to suppress it. Yin Rugeng, commissioner of the Luan-Yu area, visited Shang Zhen this morning after receiving a phone call to inquire about the situation. Because Xianghe County is adjacent to the war zone, he specifically ordered Zhang Qingyu's department of the Second Regiment of the War Zone Security Team to be on strict alert. He also ordered Gao Shimou and Zhang Jianyun, section chiefs of the Jiji-Mi District Office, to go to Xianghe to conduct an on-site investigation. Currently, the rioters are still gathered outside the east gate of the county, and they are in a standoff with the county government's defense corps. More than 20 members of the Japanese Embassy's military police team, led by squad leader Da'an, have been stationed in the city. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The riot of the people in Xianghe has not yet subsided. The rioters have elected their own county magistrate. On the 22nd, Sun Yuchen's battalion of Li Yun's fifth regiment of the Yanjiao Security Corps was transferred to the vicinity of Xianghe, listening to orders for action. Lieutenant Colonel Tanghxie Guangxiong, staff officer of the Japanese Garrison Army in Tianjin, traveled by car on the 22nd to investigate the truth. It is said that the evil people are being incited by Chinese traitors and others. Zhang Qingyu, commander of the First Regiment of the Security Corps, arrived in Tong County on the 22nd to investigate the incident. Yin Rugeng has telegraphed Chi Molin, acting commissioner of the Jiji-Mi District, to cooperate with the Security Corps and the county magistrate to properly handle the situation. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In the Xianghe Civil Disturbance, the rioters elected An Houzhai as county magistrate, publicized the wrongdoings of the former county Public Security Bureau director, and the Public Security Department director was imprisoned in a temple. The rioters issued a declaration. (Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It has now been determined that the uprising of the Xianghe rebels was orchestrated by Wu Yuting, a former provincial assemblyman who had retired, to gather ignorant people in the name of petitioning and to seize control of county affairs. County Magistrate Zhao Zhongpu has fled. Bai Chunzhi, director of the county Public Security Bureau, and Squad Leader Liu and three others have been taken away by the rebels. The county town is still closed today. The First Regiment of the Special Police has dispatched 150 police officers and is entering Xianghe today to maintain order. The provincial government has sent Wang Runsheng, who arrived in Tongming today, to go to Xianghe to investigate. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, farmers rioted in Xianghe, 40 miles from Beiping, leading a crowd to surround the city. During the riots, one demonstrator flew and injured three people. Today, peace has been declared, and order is being maintained by the defense corps. However, some farmers are still stationed in front of the city gate. Japanese military police rushed from Ping yesterday night to investigate, arresting six plainclothes Japanese hooligans who were involved in the riot, searching them, interrogating them, and then escorting them to Tianjin.

<p>(Changchun) It is reported that the "Manchukuo" government, in view of the frequent incidents on the Russian-Manchu border, consulted with the Kwantung Army authorities and will make an important proposal to Soviet Russia. Today, a Kwantung Army spokesman told news reporters that Russia and Manchuria should take appropriate plans to prevent and resolve disputes caused by unclear border lines. The spokesman did not approve of the shooting being referred to as a border-crossing patrol. He said that if Soviet Russia wants to eliminate the source of such disputes, the Kwantung Army would support the Soviet Russia's proposal to establish a joint committee to resolve the various outstanding issues. However, Soviet Russia always blames Japan or "Manchukuo" for every dispute. This attitude is very frustrating. The Kwantung Army is deeply concerned about protecting the Manchu border, as Japan has the obligation to maintain security within "Manchukuo." (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday by the Ambassador to Manchuria, the Manchu-Mongol Conference continued on the 16th and 17th. The "Manchukuo" representative, Shenji, urged the Mongolian representative to resubmit the proposal to establish representative bodies of the two countries in Changchun and Ulaanbaatar, which had been rejected before. As a result of urging the Outer Mongolian side, the Outer Mongolian representative telegraphed the Outer Mongolian government on the 18th for instructions. The reply from the Outer Mongolian government is expected in about a week. (Dentsu, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) November 7th is the 18th anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. As usual, a grand celebration will be held. The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party recently drafted the slogans to be used for this year's October Revolution anniversary. In terms of domestic policy, it focuses on balancing the interests of people in all industries, such as improving the material status of workers, building workers' residences, and increasing nutritious food. In addition, it also pays attention to "purging class enemies and eliminating the remnants of the Zinoviev and Trotsky factions." In terms of foreign policy, it cites the resolutions of the Seventh Congress of the Third International, declaring that "the world is divided into two major camps: aggressive Fascism and peaceful nations." Special tribute is paid to "the French proletariat, who are in the vanguard of anti-Fascism," and "the Ethiopian people, who are engaged in a heroic struggle for national independence."

<p>(London) It is reported that the British Cabinet has decided to convene a preliminary naval conference in London during the first week of December. As Japan has repeatedly demanded absolute equality in naval tonnage, it is considered difficult to reach a significant naval agreement at this time. It is said that when the naval conference convenes, the signatory nations of the Washington and London Naval Treaties will be asked to (1) conclude an agreement whereby signatory nations agree to mutually notify each other in advance of naval shipbuilding programs, and (2) conclude a special agreement to limit the tonnage and gun caliber of various types of warships. It is reported that Japan opposes the first type of agreement but accepts the second. Furthermore, Italy's stance remains unclear. However, since the recent easing of Anglo-Italian diplomatic relations, it is generally believed that negotiations between Britain and Italy on naval issues will proceed more easily. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(London) In order to limit Italy's commercial relations with various parts of the world, the government today announced the strict implementation of the neutrality law of the 1907 Hague Peace Conference to deal with Italian ships traveling to Britain. On Sunday, the British East Africa government announced the implementation of the neutrality law, forcing Italian ships to depart within 24 hours of arrival. The British government's actions are similar, but are not related to the League of Nations' sanctions. The British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, personally visited the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to notify the Italian government of this action. (National News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon and informed him that Britain, its territories, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan have decided to implement the neutrality regulations contained in the 1907 Hague Convention. After this notification, Italian ships carrying troops, military supplies, munitions, or water to East Africa will not be allowed to stay in British ports for more than 24 hours, and will only be allowed to purchase some coal and food sufficient to reach another Italian port. It is reported that the Egyptian government has made the same decision. According to London official circles, the implementation of the Hague Neutrality Law is not a sanction against Italy. This law applies to both belligerent nations. However, as Abyssinia does not have ships, only Italy is affected. Italy and Abyssinia have not officially declared war, but Britain believes that a war without a declaration should not receive more favorable treatment than a declared war. Britain has notified the French government of this decision. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e40">How to Prevent Car Accidents <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>Since means of transportation are becoming more novel by the day, accidents caused by reckless driving are frequently heard of. Human life is of utmost importance, and permanent disability is the most painful thing in life. Imagine yourself or your relatives and friends being injured in a car accident, and how much pain and resentment you would feel. Even those who extend benevolence to animals still have practices of protecting life and abstaining from killing. How can human life be treated lightly and trivially? Nowadays, car drivers often blame pedestrians when accidents occur, claiming that they collided with the car because they were not careful when walking. This may be true in some cases, but if drivers can understand the importance of human life, it is not difficult to save people in an instant. Moreover, the dead are gone, who can rise up and ask whether the car killed them or whether they were not careful themselves? If car accidents can be blamed solely on pedestrians, then drivers will become even more careless. Furthermore, killing people and destroying property on sidewalks and blaming it on slippery roads, claiming that it is not the driver's fault, is even more unthinkable.</p>
<p>I have pondered the causes of car accidents: (1) Due to the driver's lack of skill or inadequate physical strength and eyesight. After driving for a long time, they become mentally and physically exhausted and inadvertently cause accidents. Long-distance buses often overturn because drivers do not have the opportunity to rest and recover from fatigue. Some cause accidents because they work day and night without sufficient sleep, indulging in alcohol and pleasure, and losing their ability to drive. (2) Due to mechanical failures, such as brakes losing their effectiveness and drivers being unable to control the vehicle freely. (3) Those who ride in cars are usually wealthy and influential, and are not afraid of fines, which they do not value. As a result, drivers dare to disregard everything. (4) A few individuals who rely on special influence and are not subject to our laws often drive at high speeds and arbitrarily violate traffic regulations. (5) Commercial vehicles sometimes disregard traffic regulations, driving at high speeds to compete for passengers, often leading to jealousy, fights, car damage, and injuries. These are generally the causes of accidents.</p>
<p>We believe that in order to ensure the safety of the public on the roads: (1) The granting of driver's licenses should be subject to strict examination, and vehicles should be inspected at any time to verify the condition of their machinery. (2) Traffic regulations should be strictly enforced without any preferential treatment based on the driver's status. As the American court did not lightly forgive President Roosevelt's son for violating traffic regulations, this is commendable. (3) In addition to revoking driver's licenses, causing death should not be limited to fines, but should also be subject to imprisonment. Only in this way will money be ineffective and people will know what to fear. (4) Those who are recklessly disregardful should be dealt with by the local authorities through negotiation to supplement the shortcomings of the law. (5) Shanghai's roads were originally only for horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians. In the past twenty years, the city's commerce has flourished and automobiles have developed. The old roads are insufficient to accommodate them. Especially in the city, the roads still retain their old-style streets and alleys. Rickshaws must yield to each other, but automobiles are also allowed to pass at the same time, causing great distress to pedestrians. Therefore, the danger of traffic accidents cannot be reduced without reorganizing the roads as soon as possible. This is what we hope from the municipal authorities.</p>

<p>Resolution of Shantou Smuggling Incident</p>
<p>The Agreement was Signed at Noon on the 16th, and the Japanese Warship Left Shantou on the Evening of the 17th, but the Contents Were Not Announced.</p>
<p>A correspondence from Shantou reports that the detention of smuggled rice, oil, and soybeans in Jieyang has been a serious situation since September 10. The Japanese Navy dispatched Rear Admiral Masasuke Shimomura, commander of the 5th Torpedo Squadron, leading the Ryuta, Fujino, Asagao, Karukaya, Tadeo, Fuji, and Ren ships, claiming to protect Japanese residents and declaring that they would not leave Shantou until a satisfactory solution was reached. This caused great anxiety among the citizens. Furthermore, the Japanese Marine Corps repeatedly landed in groups, parading on the streets, gathering at the Toyo School, or at the train station, which led to the constant spread of strange rumors. The Guangzhou authorities sent Wu Bosheng to Shantou to handle the negotiations. However, both sides maintained secrecy, making it difficult to know the specific details. It is rumored that the Japanese side put forward the following conditions: (1) Japanese merchants transporting goods such as oil, soybeans, rice, sugar, foreign yarn, seafood, matches, and tobacco essence will be exempted from all local special taxes, miscellaneous taxes, and surcharges in addition to paying regular customs duties when transporting them into Shantou and the Chaozhou-Meizhou hinterland; (2) In order to prevent accidental harassment or obstruction of Japanese and Taiwanese merchants operating and transporting goods, a commercial district will be designated from Youtouqi to Xinxing Road, and docks and warehouses will be built at the end of Shenzhao Road, and commercial commissioners and warehouses will be established in prosperous fair markets in the Chaozhou and Jieyang hinterland to facilitate the sale of goods in the local area. The oil, rice, and soybeans detained in Jieyang must be returned and losses compensated; (3) The government must issue a proclamation protecting trade, canceling previous secret orders issued by the military and local groups to assist in the seizure of smuggled goods. Local officials must assist Japanese merchants in building docks in Qilu and prevent various northern groups or the public from obstructing in the name of opposition; (4) The government should be responsible for protecting Japanese merchants' goods transported to the hinterland for sale and not allow the people to use the name of any group to repel or obstruct them; (5) Guarantee that there will be no recurrence of similar incidents; (6) The Japanese side will build an air force landing field in Shantou to facilitate civilian flights from Taiwan to Shantou. The above six items are what the Japanese and Taiwanese people in Shantou have said. The Cantonese province was given until the 14th to respond. The government side refused to make a public announcement and strictly prohibited the dissemination of the above information. However, based on reason and theory, the Japanese side's requests, such as releasing the detained rice, compensating for losses, and Japanese merchants' goods being exempted from all other local taxes other than customs duties, and that the tax inspection and local military police should not obstruct Japanese merchants transporting goods to the hinterland, are more credible. Other items are likely to be deliberately released by the Japanese and Taiwanese to create an atmosphere. After Wu Bosheng arrived in Shantou, he collaborated with Mayor Li Yuanhe and Customs Superintendent Zhang Jinghui to take charge of the negotiations. At the same time, Fan Zhanpeng, the deputy director of anti-smuggling, also increased the number of anti-smuggling soldiers in Shantou. Li Hanhun requested Guangzhou to send more military police to Shantou to maintain order and reassure the people. According to reports, by the 11th, the Shantou Municipal Government had sent Secretary Li Chaofan and Fan Zhanpeng back to the province to report. At the same time, Gan Jiehou also negotiated with Japanese Consul General Kawa Tatsuo stationed in Guangzhou. On the 16th, both parties had already agreed that each other considered it a local incident. At 11:00 a.m. that day, Shantou Mayor Li Yuanhe, according to instructions from the province, immediately signed a resolution with Japanese Consul General Harada Tadaichi in a satisfactory atmosphere. Rear Admiral Masasuke Shimomura, commander of the Japanese fleet, also visited Li Hanhun at the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office. In the evening, Li Yuanhe hosted a banquet at the Police Recreation Association to entertain Shimomura, Harada, and others, with Customs Superintendent Zhang Jinghui and many others accompanying them. On the 17th, Li Hanhun returned the visit to the Japanese consulate, and Li Yuanhe also returned the visit to Shimomura on the Ryuta ship. At about 6:00 p.m., two Japanese warships left Shantou in the dim twilight, but one Japanese warship remained in the port of Shantou and had not left. (18th)</p>
<p>Implementation of Extraterritorial Communication</p>
<p>Chinese and English Telegrams Opened on the 16th, Japanese Telegrams Starting on November 1st</p>
<p>A correspondence from Tianjin reports that Wang Ruoxi, Director of the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Takeshita Yoshiharu, Chief of the Kwantung Army's Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, and Fujiwara Yasuaki, Director of the Manchurian Postal Service, began to discuss the issue of extraterritorial communication in June of this year. After more than ten meetings in Beidaihe, Beiping, and Tianjin, they finally decided on the general outline of all communication and signed an agreement on the 30th of last month. Except for the sending and receiving of Japanese telegrams, which will be handled starting on November 1st due to the time required for preparation, the Chinese and English plain and cipher telegrams will be handled starting on October 16th. This matter was already implemented informally in the spring of this year. The only difference is how to settle the telegram fees, and that Japanese telegrams are still not sent or received. This agreement is a contractual agreement on the previously implemented items to be observed by both parties. Previously, the telegram fees were collected and used independently. Now, according to international communication practice, the sending and receiving bureaus keep daily accounts and settle them once at the end of each month. However, neither party directly assumes responsibility for the settlement. The Huito Transfer Company, the organizer of postal services in Shanhaiguan, is entrusted with the matter. Surpluses are paid, and deficits are supplemented. The domestic communication bureaus are limited to the telegraph bureaus in Tianjin and Beiping. Extraterritorially, they are limited to the Kwantung Prefecture area, the railway affiliated area along the South Manchuria Railway, and Shenyang, Jilin, Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar. The remaining branch bureaus in various places do not send or receive telegrams. If telegrams are sent to places other than the above sending and receiving bureaus, the receiving bureaus will forward them themselves after receiving them. In addition to English and Chinese, telegrams in Japanese are also sent and received. The fee for ordinary Chinese telegrams is 12 cents per word for plain text and 24 cents per word for cipher text. The name and address of the recipient are also charged at the rate of two words. English telegrams are sent and received according to the international communication fee calculation method. For Japanese telegrams, every five Japanese letters are counted as a sentence, and the fee is the same as the Chinese example. The fee for news telegrams is reduced by a quarter, and the fee for urgent telegrams is doubled. The Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, in order to handle Japanese telegrams immediately, specially requested permission from the Ministry of Communications to transfer eight Japanese telegram operators from the Qingdao Telegraph Bureau to Tianjin to assist. On November 1st, only Japanese telegrams can be received first. Due to machine issues, outbound telegrams are scheduled to be implemented on January 1st of next year. Wang Ruoxi, Director of the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, is responsible for handling this matter. On the 19th, he was summoned to Beijing by telegram by the Ministry of Communications to present everything. After the 918 Incident, when the Northeast was lost, communication outside the customs never ceased. Inbound and outbound telegrams were connected through the Tianjin Radio Station and the Harbin Radio Station. Foreigners in China, except for political and military news, could still transmit them. Now that an agreement has been clearly concluded, it should be much more convenient than before. (20th)</p>
<p>The Beginning and End of the Bandit Remnants' Escape to Gansu</p>
<p>The Bandit Leaders Have Conflicting Opinions, and the Bandit Masses are Also Surrendering One After Another</p>
<p>A correspondence from Lanzhou reports that after the Zhu, Mao, Xu, and Peng bandits joined forces in western Sichuan, they suffered almost complete losses in strength due to the encirclement and suppression by the National Army. Furthermore, because the northwestern region is located on a plateau with perennial snow cover and is extremely barren, making it impossible to survive, they had to find another way out. Therefore, they had the intention of fleeing north. In early September, they attempted to flee to Qinghai. However, because the southern part of Qinghai is mostly barren, and miasma occurs from time to time, not only was there no food, but even drinking water was a problem. Furthermore, they were attacked by Tibetan soldiers. Their cunning plan failed, and the bandit leaders held a meeting in Mao'ergai to decide on future actions. At that time, there were different opinions, and they blamed each other. Zhu and Mao blamed Xu and Chen for the failure to cross the Jialing River, and Xu and Chen blamed Zhu and Mao for the long-term fighting in Jiangxi, which led to the loss of strength. In the end, it was decided that Zhu and Zhang would lead the pseudo-59th and 2nd Army Corps and the pseudo-9th and 31st Army to flee north across the Yellow River via Heba, and Xu and Zhou would lead the pseudo-1st and 3rd Army Corps and the pseudo-4th and 30th Army to flee north via Baozuo. It was unexpected that the opinions of the people in the valley had long been inconsistent. Therefore, the pseudo-chiefs of the Baozuo clan soon held a meeting, and Mao advocated fleeing to Gansu, while Xu and Chen advocated returning to Li Mao. The meeting ended without a conclusion. The next morning, Mao, Peng, and others arbitrarily led the pseudo-1st and 3rd Army Corps to flee north towards Minxia, and Xu also led the pseudo-4th and 30th Army to flee back to Mao'ergai. Zhu was still near Awa.</p>
<p>The bandits who fled to Gansu were the main forces of Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Peng Dehuai, and others, initially numbering about 10,000 people. They fled towards Min County and came into contact with the Lu division of the National Army several times. Due to the disparity in numbers, they were unable to repel the bandits. Later, the Tang Huaiyuan unit of the 12th Division of the National Army arrived in Min County in a timely manner and gave the bandits a head-on blow, causing them to suffer heavy losses. Failing to capture Min County, they turned east and fled. The 5th Cavalry Regiment of the National Army pursued the bandits, who fled to Tongwei through Hadapu, Qingjiayi, Xinshizhen, Yuanyangpu and other places. When they reached Tongwei, the county seat was occupied because there were no garrison troops. The county seat was soon recovered by the Mao Bingwen unit of the National Army, and Mao immediately pursued the bandits relentlessly, day and night. After the bandits were defeated in Tongwei, they fled to Jieshipu, Qingjiayi, Jiangjunbao, and Zhang Yibao, suffering repeated heavy losses along the way. Coupled with the lack of food and long marches, they were exhausted. More than half of them were killed or wounded, and countless surrendered to the National Army on their own initiative. After the remnant bandits passed the Liupan Mountains, they were blocked by the He cavalry and the 35th Division of the National Army stationed in eastern Gansu. Currently, there are less than 2,000 people left. The National Army has pursued them to the Hongde City area of Huai County. With a large army blocking them in front and a heroic division pursuing them relentlessly behind, the annihilation of the bandits is not far off.</p>
<p>The remaining bandits in Sichuan, without food or clothing, and suffering from miasma and epidemics, wanted to flee north, but were blocked by a large army and could not cross Leichi for a single step. According to recent news, bandits are dying from starvation, cold, and the spread of epidemics. It is estimated that more than 10,000 have died in the past month. Furthermore, winter is approaching, and it will be even more difficult for the remnants to survive. (October 18)</p>

<p>The Water Patrol Continues to Capture Bandits</p>
<p>Robberies have been frequent in the Peinan area recently. The case of a truck being robbed by bandits on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in Yanggongmiao caused a stir. After County Magistrate Li Leng took office, he ordered the water and land police teams to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators. Fei Gongxia, the captain of the water patrol team, led a team to investigate bandit tracks in Caojing and Shanyang. They found two bandits carrying firearms in a water nest, and they were clearly not good people. They were arrested and interrogated. According to their confessions, one was Huang Hailin and the other was Jiang Zhenglin. It was learned that they were suspected of being involved in the Punan robbery case. Jiang Zhenglin then confessed that a fellow accomplice named Xia Zhengyu. He has now been arrested at Xia's hideout and is currently being interrogated at the team headquarters in the hope of capturing all the criminals in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>The County Government Plans to Levy the Second Term of Land Tax</p>
<p>The Wuxian County Government has set up a counter to start collecting the fourth installment of the first Ming land price tax, which is 40%. It has been two months since the collection began, but the amount collected has been very small because the farmers have not yet harvested. The County Magistrate of Wu believes that the autumn harvest is now ripe and is about to be harvested. Therefore, he specially ordered Zhu Wensu, the director of the field tax collection office, to immediately start collecting the second term of the land price tax on the 22nd. Director Zhu immediately instructed the book compilation office to comply. Once the results of the autumn survey are determined, the collection will begin on a scheduled date. Zhang Hanwei and Song Jinghuan, the autumn survey commissioners sent by the province, set off by boat on the 21st with Director Dong of the county government to survey Xiangcheng and other villages.</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank Employee Flees with a Huge Amount of Money</p>
<p>Wang Cainan, the director of the cashier department of the Suzhou Agricultural Bank and the director of the county government's general revenue office, 26 years old, from Fengjing, was ordered a few days ago to take 120,000 yuan in cash and 30,000 yuan in cash from the Kunshan branch to Shanghai to deposit with the head office. Unexpectedly, he never returned. It was not until the 21st that it was known that Wang had fled to Tianjin and then to Liaoning. The old Director Zhu immediately reported to the head office and negotiated with Wang's guarantor. Fearing that the depositors would misunderstand, he immediately raised a large amount of cash to meet the depositors' needs. It is also rumored that Chen Herong, the director of the Changshu Agricultural Bank, who is from Suzhou, also fled with 80,000 yuan a week ago.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Silk Factories Increase Wages</p>
<p>The Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Union Organizing Committee convened the organizers of various factory branches on the 22nd to hold the first representative meeting. Tao Shensheng chaired the meeting and resolved: (1) The working hours of each factory should be communicated to the Silk Factory Association by letter, and the factories should be required to strictly implement the "six in, six out" rule; (2) Increase workers' wages as the silk market soars; (3) Restore silkworm moth subsidies; (4) Worker bonuses should be set at two working days per month; (5) Workers' wages should be paid no later than the 16th of the following month to maintain workers' livelihoods.</p>
<p>More Than 3,000 Pieces of Winter Clothing Raised</p>
<p>After the county party headquarters of this county was ordered to establish a flood relief sub-committee, it hired leaders from all walks of life as members. It then held the first committee meeting and decided to raise funds for various relief measures. The chapter members of various schools raised cold clothes. More than 3,600 pieces have been delivered, and it is planned to transport them to the province within a few days. In terms of donations, it was decided that the Entertainment Industry Association would be responsible for raising 1,500 yuan, each district office would be responsible for raising 200 yuan, and organizations such as the Red Swastika Society and the Chamber of Commerce would raise 3,000 yuan, all of which have been accumulated. At the same time, the county party headquarters organized a flood relief propaganda committee to expand propaganda work and hold book club and radio broadcast lectures, which is very enthusiastic about disaster relief.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>The County Government Prohibits the Smuggling of Grain for Export</p>
<p>Since the autumn grain harvest in this county, rice prices have increased instead of decreasing. It is learned that the increase in the price of rice has continued to increase in recent times, and the poor people who generally seek to make a living are all suffering because of this. However, there are different opinions on the reasons for the high price. Some say that it is due to unscrupulous merchants smuggling exports, and others say that wealthy people in various villages are hoarding and speculating. It is heard that the county government, in view of the fact that the city is in poverty and the yellow peril is inevitable in Yangzhou, how can it allow rice prices to continue to soar? It is proposed to issue a strict ban on the export of food without a permit, and to crack down on hoarding and speculation in rural households in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>

Director Yang, Director Huang, and Xiao Weiguo of the Traffic Department gave speeches successively. At noon, a banquet was held at the New Asia Hotel. The meeting continued at 2 p.m. to discuss proposals. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Names of Attendees:</p>
<p>Sun Chenchu and Zhu Xinshan of Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company; Lu Shao Liu and Zhu Ganchen of Zhendao Long-Distance Bus Company; Jiang Huichan and Guo Songru of Zhendanjinbiao Long-Distance Bus Company; Bai Minshi and Xu Housen of Anhui Jingwuxi Section Long-Distance Bus Company; Wang Jizhang of Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company; Lou Zhi of Shaochengshan Bus Company; Xie Xianglin and Zhang Dexi of Fanyao Long-Distance Bus Company; Wang Bangtao and Li Lingzhi of Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration; Jin Tanghou of Songxin Road Automobile Co., Ltd.; Xi Pengnian of Zhuan Steamboat Company; Jie Guanwu of Jiading Shipping Company; Lu Zhiyu and Shi Shouqi of China Merchants Inland Steamboat Company; Tao Gongliang of Taixing Steamboat Company; Fang Shou Zhang and Wang Tingchen of Tongshang Steamboat Bureau; Xia Sumin and Xia Zhegong of Tongda Yuanji Steamboat Bureau; Sun Yingu and Dong Yizhi of XinYun Joint Transportation Company; Huang Baoxian and He Zhijing of China Aviation Company; Zheng Hongyan and Pan Guangyu of China Travel Service; and Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Railway Bureaus, Wu Shaozeng, Deputy Director, and the heads of various departments and sections.</p>
<p>Speech by Representative of the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Yang Songqing, Representative of the Ministry of Railways, said in his speech that the main expression of the railway business is the transportation business. The development of the transportation business directly increases the income of the railway and indirectly benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. Because of the convenience of transportation, goods can flow smoothly, which can increase production on the one hand and develop the economy on the other. Our country is in the midst of national difficulties, facing the oppression of the world economy externally and feeling the panic of rural decline internally. In the future, the railway policy will take the vigorous development of transportation as the first priority to reverse the economic panic, and joint transportation is of great importance. If the joint transportation business is not completed in one day, it will be difficult for transportation to reach the extreme point of convenience and speed. In the past three years, we have realized that the development of transportation and joint transportation business cannot be delayed. Therefore, we held responsible transportation in the 21st year and restored the national railway cargo responsible joint transportation in the 22nd year. Although it has been successful step by step, we cannot think that it has reached the realm of success. It can only be regarded as the initial start of the work. Although the joint transportation between railways has been successful, the joint transportation between railways and land, sea, and air is still in its early stages. The further connection and development is the only goal of our future efforts, and it is the mission that all of you present here should jointly shoulder. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways are located in a strategic location, and all the areas along the route are prosperous and fertile lands in the southeast. Waterways and highways are scattered like stars and as dense as spider webs. All the various land, sea, and air transportation agencies are as dependent on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways as the auxiliary vehicles, and it is necessary to seek mutual connection</p>

<p>The Broker is Dazzled by Lime and Loses His Eyesight; Handgun Snatched</p>
<p>Around 4 AM yesterday, at the entrance of Shoupin Lane on Huade Road in eastern Shanghai, while the neighborhood watchman, who guarded Number 1618 of the lane, was on night watch, four thugs wearing short blue cotton shirts and trousers suddenly appeared. They surrounded the watchman, each carrying a paper packet. Caught off guard, the watchman had the paper packet thrown at his face. Unexpectedly, the packet contained lime, instantly blinding the watchman. The thugs then snatched his handgun and fled. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the watchman desperately cried, "Catch the robbers!" When nearby patrol officers arrived in response to the alarm, the thugs had long disappeared. The patrol officers then reported the incident to the responsible police station for investigation and apprehension.</p>
<p>Wu Kunlin Attempts Suicide Twice, Survives</p>
<p>Once Saved from Jumping Off a Building by a Friend, Again Rescued from Drowning by Boatmen</p>
<p>—The Reason for Suicide is Utterly Worthless—</p>
<p>At 11 PM on the 20th of this month, a young man attempted to jump from the fourth floor of the Great World amusement arcade near the New West Bridge in the French Concession. Fortunately, he was pulled back by a friend at the critical moment, averting a tragedy. As it was nearly midnight, many tourists were gathered at the arcade, so word of the incident quickly spread. Showing his determination to die, the same man jumped into the Suzhou River from the Zhashan Road Bridge around 1 PM yesterday. As it was daytime, his actions alarmed many boatmen, who cried for help and rescued him. He was then taken to the police station. During interrogation, he identified himself as Wu Kunlin, 14 years old, from Jiujiang, residing at Number 55 Jianzhong Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. His family lives in the countryside. He used to work as a shop assistant for a Westerner across the street, but the Westerner has returned to his country, leaving Wu Kunlin unemployed for three years. As his family in his hometown is relatively well-off, he has not experienced financial difficulties. However, the reason for his suicide is quite laughable. He claimed that after arguing with his brother, he was determined to wander in Shanghai and vowed never to return home. Now, because his family in the countryside has cut off financial support, he is facing economic pressure but still refuses to return home. As a result, he has exhausted all his resources and seeks death as a solution. The police officers, upon hearing this, criticized him for his actions being utterly worthless. They then found three suicide notes on his person. One was addressed to his parents, vaguely stating that he had repeatedly received instructions to return home, which he dared not disobey. However, he found it difficult to make a living in Shanghai, and returning home in such a state would be a disgrace to his family, and that his wife could remarry. Another was addressed to his uncle and aunt, vaguely stating that he was forced to commit suicide by jumping off a building due to livelihood issues in Shanghai, without any other intentions. The last was a personal account filled with complaints, which was omitted. The police station, concerned that he might attempt suicide again, ordered detective Huang Songsheng to summon his friend to take him home and keep a close watch on him, sending him back to his hometown.</p>

<p>French Concession Orders Residents to Provide Their Own Garbage Bins</p>
<p>Garbage to be Cleared by Laborers Hired by the Municipal Council at Specific Times</p>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council has established specific measures for clearing garbage within the Concession and has issued a notice for residents to comply. The original text states: "Notice: All residents within the French Concession must comply with the following garbage regulations. Each household should provide its own convenient, covered garbage bin inside its main or secondary building for disposing of daily household garbage. The Municipal Council has a model garbage bin for sale, which residents can purchase. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Municipal Council and property owners, laborers hired by the Municipal Council to transport garbage are not allowed to enter private residences, private roads, or alleyways. Residents should place the garbage bin next to the road each morning when the garbage truck passes. The garbage inside the bin will be cleared by the Municipal Council's laborers. It is forbidden to place garbage on public roads, open spaces, or in ditches. The garbage bin should not be placed at the roadside before the garbage truck arrives, nor should it be left on the roadside after the garbage truck has passed. The Municipal Council may, upon the request of landlords, clean garbage in private roads and alleyways, but the landlord must prepay a handling fee equal to 4% of the total monthly rental income of all properties in that area every six months. Garbage truck passage times are as follows: April 1st to September 30th, 5 AM to 8 AM; October 1st to March 31st of the following year, 6 AM to 9 AM. Each garbage truck will have a bell that rings when it passes to alert residents. Violations of these regulations will be fined between one and five dollars, and repeat offenders will be subject to double penalties. (Note:) Garbage refers to kitchen waste and household dust. Garden waste, animal waste, or bricks and soil should not be considered garbage and should be disposed of by the residents themselves. The Municipal Council hereby reminds residents of the French Concession that disposing of garbage on the roadside will have many adverse effects (such as breeding flies and propagating harmful bacteria). Therefore, all residents within the Concession are urged to comply with these regulations in good faith."</p>
<p>Western Shanghai Farmer, A Long, Experiences Robbery on His Wedding Night</p>
<p>Father Beaten on the Head</p>
<p>Silverware Stolen</p>
<p>Tang Junpei, a farmer from Guangang Township in western Shanghai, is over sixty years old. His son, A Long, is thirty years old and works as a carpenter in Shanghai. He was not yet married. This spring, a colleague, Mr. Wang from Pu, acted as a matchmaker, arranging a marriage with Miss Ding from Chongming Island. The wedding was held on the 18th of this month. However, around 10 PM the night before yesterday, several robbers broke into the house and rushed into the bridal chamber. The newlyweds woke up in shock and cried for help. The robbers used guns to prevent them from making noise. They dragged the groom out of bed, flirted with the bride, snatched two gold rings from her hand, smashed open a suitcase, and stole over ten dollars and a leather cheongsam. They then beat A Long and forced him to hand over silver dollars. A Long pleaded that he had borrowed money from relatives and friends for the wedding and still owed money for the banquet, so he had no silver dollars. The robbers then stole a silk robe and a watch. As the robbers were leaving, A Long's father cried for help and was beaten on the head with a stick. He sought medical attention at Shanghai Hospital yesterday. Fortunately, his life is not in danger. However, A Long, newly married, has suffered this tragedy and is deeply traumatized.</p>

<p>Dispute at Yixin Toothbrush Factory Resolved Through Mediation by the General Labor Union</p>
<p>Two Resolutions Reached by Both Parties</p>
<p>The Yixin Toothbrush Factory on Xietu Road in the South City recently announced that it would cancel the no-work subsidy and provide only a 20-cent meal allowance starting on August 1 due to the impact of the sluggish market, which aroused opposition from all workers. The Toothbrush Workers' Union sent representatives to negotiate with the factory several times, but no results were achieved. The Municipal General Labor Union believed that if the case was not resolved, it would inevitably lead to unexpected disputes, so it specially invited both parties to mediate at 2 PM yesterday. Manager Dai from the factory and Zhao Fayuan and others from the workers' side attended. After repeated persuasion, two resolutions were reached: (1) The no-work subsidy will be changed to 45 cents (7.5 cents per hour) from October 1, 1935. This measure will be valid for one year. If the factory's business does not improve after one year, it may continue to be effective. Both parties were satisfied and declared the resolution.</p>

<p>Zhang Guoqing and Others Use Cruel Methods</p>
<p>Administering Criminal Tattoo to Thief</p>
<p>Tattooing the Words "Robber" on the Thief's Face with Blue Ink</p>
<p>According to forensic medical appraisal, these two words can no longer be erased.</p>
<p>Teng Shunzi from Yangzhou broke into Zhang Guoqing's house at No. 46 Lane 36, Tianbao Road, Zhabei on the night of September 21 to commit theft. He was caught on the spot by Zhang Guoqing, who, together with Wang Dacheng, Wang Maojun, and others, tied Teng Shunzi to a pillar, beat him, and used a needle to tattoo the words "Robber" on Teng's left cheek, applying blue ink. Then, they released him. Teng Shunzi suffered a lifelong humiliation and reported the incident to the local police, who arrested Zhang Guoqing, Wang Dacheng, and Wang Maojun and took them to the police station together with Teng Shunzi. The case was forwarded to the Procuratorate of the District Court, where Prosecutor Zhang Zi determined that Teng Shunzi had committed the crime of Article 321, Paragraph 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, and Zhang Guoqing, Wang Dacheng, Wang Maojun, and others had committed the crime of Article 278, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Wu Xiangzu specially opened the 13th court to hear the case. After the judge took his seat, he ordered the detention of Teng Shunzi, Zhang Guoqing, Wang Dacheng, Wang Maojun, and others to the court. First, Teng Shunzi testified that he was 25 years old and had been forced by unemployment and hunger to commit theft. Unfortunately, he was caught by them, who first beat him severely and then tied him to a pillar and stabbed him with a long needle on his left face, causing unbearable pain. Even if he begged along the streets, no one would give him money because of the words on his face. Therefore, he reported the incident to the police, requesting justice. As he finished his testimony, he looked up and asked the court to examine the obvious "Robber" words on his face (about the size of copper coins). Then, Zhang Guoqing testified that he was 23 years old, from Yangzhou, and worked to make a living. Teng Shunzi came to steal, and he caught him, but he did not beat or tattoo him. Wang Maojun testified that he was 21 years old, from Taixing. Wang Dacheng testified that he was 21 years old, from Taixing. Their testimonies were generally the same as Zhang Guoqing's. The judge, upon hearing the testimonies, said, "Are you imitating the ancients in treating those who tunnel and steal by tattooing their faces for identification, so that people can see them and take precautions?" Zhang and others replied together, "We did not tattoo him." The judge said, "He committed theft, and you should have reported it to the police and arrested him. How could you use such cruel methods, making it impossible for him to stand in society? According to forensic medical appraisal, the tattoo cannot be erased. Your actions are too cruel. The crime you committed is punishable by five to twelve years. You should confess the truth. Who came up with the idea, and who tattooed him?" However, Zhang Guoqing and others denied it and tried to deny it. At this point, Prosecutor Zhang came to the court and stated his opinion. The judge concluded that the case was clear and decided to end it. The verdict will be announced at 10:00 AM on the 29th of this month. All defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>This year's Chinese Football League was originally scheduled to open on the 26th of this month.

This is due to the delay caused by the National Games. It is now decided to start on November 2nd (next Saturday). It is hoped that all members will expedite the various procedures so that the competition can start as scheduled. In addition, the location of each team's playing field, as well as the mailing address, telephone number, and name of the manager, must also be submitted together to be printed in the order book.</p>

<p>Li Huitang Returns to Hong Kong Today</p>
<p>Received Urgent Telegram to Return and See His Wife's Illness</p>
<p>Yan Chengkun and Huang Jiajun, the general team leaders from Hong Kong attending the National Games, and Li Huitang and others, returned to Hong Kong on the Japanese Empress on the 23rd. Although the number of participating events was not large, the results were excellent. The men's championship ranked third, and more than 30 prizes were won. Chairman Lin's golden dagger and Song Ziliang's silver ball were especially valuable. This was an unprecedented achievement for the Hong Kong team attending the National Games. According to Mr. Yan, the athletes who attended this time, except for the football team, still have to stay in Shanghai and go to Beijing to participate in the disaster relief competition, and will not return to Hong Kong on the British mail until the 29th. The others are scheduled to return south on the Dutch ship Zhishadanani on the 24th. Due to work reasons, he and the deputy team leader were unable to accompany them. Li Huitang also originally planned to stay in Shanghai and participate in the disaster relief competition, but received an urgent telegram to return and see his wife's illness, so he could not fulfill his wish, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Football Disaster Relief Game</p>
<p>Tickets on Sale Starting Today</p>
<p>The National Games, which mobilized hundreds of thousands of people and lasted 11 days, closed the other day. The athletes from all over the country have left Shanghai in batches. Among them, football is particularly outstanding, so it has won a lot of praise from Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. Mayor Wu of the city requested that the Malayan overseas Chinese athletes who participated in this National Games, and the famous football players from Hong Kong and Guangdong, be strong and skilled, won the football championship, and were admired by all walks of life. Yesterday, at the request of the Water Disaster Relief Charity Association, he contacted Mr. Yan Chengkun, the general team leader of the Hong Kong District, to ask them to hold a relief performance in Shanghai after the end of the National Games, and donate all the ticket money to relief efforts. It is learned that Mr. Yan has received this proposal and is preparing to hold it in the central district of the city on the 26th of this month. In order to avoid congestion at that time, the responsible authorities of the Water Disaster</p>

<p>Free Talk: New Autumn Scenery of the Japanese Literary World (Tokyo Correspondence) by Luo Zhi</p>
<p>A Japanese writer said in a literary review that the phenomenon in the Japanese literary world is like a couple quarreling in the middle of the night, with only sharp cries and shouts, and no way to know the inside story. Although this remark has a bit of humor, it also has some truth. For example, the "New Social School," "New Psychological School," and "New Sensationalist School" of a few years ago can be included in this kind of example. Even recently, isn't this kind of metabolism still being played out? Regarding this, we can cite "Activism," "Verbatim Literature," and "Accidentalism."</p>
<p>The Defeat of Activism</p>
<p>The so-called activism in Japan is essentially a combination of Japanese liberalism and the French "humanism of action." Ten years ago, liberalism and leftist thought could be said to be the two major ideological trends standing side by side in Japan. The former originated in France, while the latter originated in Russia and Germany. Later, leftist thought gained momentum and suppressed liberalism. This continued until last year when leftist thought suffered a temporary setback. At the same time, liberalism was revived by the new convergence of the French "humanism of action." As a result, the magazine "Action" was founded as a publication platform, and a series of books were published, which indeed had the potential to sweep the entire Japanese literary world. However, by April and May of this year, signs of decline had already appeared. At that time, Komatsu Kiyoshi, a theorist of activism, made such a bold statement in order to save the situation: "If no one else will do it, I will do it alone!" In this way, he barely managed to support it until now, but finally, he could no longer support it, and he had to announce the suspension of publication of its organ, "Action." Now, looking back on the gains of activism, what are they? Perhaps only the recently opened so-called "Action Coffee Shop." Mr. Funahashi Seiichi, who claims to be an activist writer, even made such a desperate cry:</p>
<p>"...Although activism has been ordered to withdraw from collectivism here, there is still a long and enduring life in the spirit of activism, which will be a great guiding force for Japanese literature in the future. On this point, even if it suffers a setback in the morning or evening, it cannot die. On the contrary, it can be said that the future is shining with hopeful light. The spiritual state of this young generation will continue to develop without any damage. Why? Because cultural control is currently prevalent, and the tasks of cultural protection, technological value, academic freedom, and the defense of the intellectual class are forcing the Japanese intellectuals in all aspects, so the task of activism is even greater. But finally, what I want to say is that activism is not just a literary school that creates action-oriented new social novels for private novels, but a greater literary spirit, and an attitude of integrity from writers in distress."</p>
<p>This activism, which has become a homeless dog, will probably be difficult to revive even if it cries out like this unless it changes its ways.</p>
<p>The Advance of Verbatim Literature</p>
<p>Regarding the advocacy of verbatim literature, I once introduced it in this publication. At that time, what was introduced was only the basis for the emergence of verbatim literature and the theory of creation. But now this movement has expanded even further, and even a magazine called "Verbatim Literature" has been published. The original members were Kimura Ki, Kishi Sanji, Tamura Eitaro, Sakamura Seiji, Iwasaki Sakae, Sasamoto Tora, and Kataoka Ko. New members include Kaionji Chogoro, Togawa Sadao, and Toyoshima Kaoru. Naturally, these people all have their own interpretations of verbatim literature, and their motivations for participating are also different.</p>
<p>Kimura Ki interprets verbatim literature from his usual standpoint of biographical novels, and he is also engaged in biographical literary work, starting with "Rai Sanyo."</p>
<p>Kishi Sanji, as an advocate of verbatim literature, has written many essays. One is the elimination of the vulgarity of popular literature, and the other is the issue of popularizing literature. His work is "Ishida Mitsunari." This work is now being staged at the Tsukiji Little Theater as a performance commemorating the first anniversary of the New Cooperative Theater Company.</p>
<p>Iwasaki Sakae wrote a verbatim novel called "Tenpo Chushingura." It is about a peasant uprising that occurred in Dewa.</p>
<p>Iwamoto Tora faithfully depicts the cross-section of the history of the Meiji Restoration with "Kaishu and the Masseuse" and "The Red-Light District at the End of the幕末 Period."</p>
<p>Kataoka Ko wrote "Iron Guns and Tsurukichi" from the standpoint of verbatim literature, and he also wrote an essay "The Process to Verbatim Literature," stipulating the theory of verbatim literature as follows:</p>
<p>"Rectifying the errors of traditionally popular historical records, vigorously appealing to the public's interest in knowledge, needless to say, this is the standpoint of historical literature. But history is not something that is dead and on the other shore, it is the content of us today. To treat it as something dead is only for archaeologists. If you want to know the past, you must know the present; if you want to know the present, you must know the history of the past. Although this is contradictory, true historical literature that depicts modern human beings emerges from the mutual understanding of these two things. Moreover, as long as it is literature, the writer's imagination and fantasy cannot be lightly dismissed. Not only that, but the writer's imagination and fantasy can also infinitely move towards the gaps in the historical records that have been distorted and buried. As long as the historical view is sound..."</p>
<p>Although this is Mr. Kataoka's personal opinion, it can also be said to be the overall opinion, because the opposition to vulgar and obscene entertainment reading, the emphasis on historical truth, the giving of modern interpretations, and the demand for simple expression are the reasons for the members' common agreement.</p>
<p>Since its inception in the spring, the Verbatim Literature Research Association has not yet produced any significant major works in addition to the achievements mentioned above. However, due to the emergence of the magazine "Verbatim Literature," we can conclude that it will flourish recently.</p>
<p>Describing Nature by Qu Yi</p>
<p>Here, the so-called person who studies immortality is actually a person who studies nature. It is said that the death of a person who studies nature is not called death, but 物化 [wù huà, transformation of things]. Because he is a part of nature, and nature has its transactions; his death is merely a change in nature. It is not really death, because the existence or non-existence of the body cannot be used as a rule for life and death. The so-called "dust and dirt" can also "mold Yao and Shun into one." Only by studying the "divine person on Mount Miaogushe, who does not eat grains, drinks wind and dew, rides on clouds and controls flying dragons, and travels beyond the four seas, whose spirit is concentrated, so that things are not diseased... even if there are great floods that reach the sky, they will not drown him, and even if there is a great drought, metal and stone will flow, and earthen mountains will be scorched but not hot," can one achieve the ultimate goal. This is the unified personality of nature and man that they seek. The highest goal of nature worshipers is to pursue this unified personality.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the so-called unification is by no means the surrender of one side to the other, completely eliminating the individuality of one side and conforming to the individuality of the other. The unified personality pursued by nature worshipers is rather the elimination of one's own personality and conforming to the rule of nature. This is not unification, but destruction. True unification must be in the heroic struggle between man and nature. The so-called "change" in the Book of Changes means this. The Tuan says: "Water and fire counteract each other, and two women live together, but their wills cannot be united, so it is called change. Change is believed, civilization is explained, and great success is achieved with righteousness. Change is appropriate, and regret will disappear. Heaven and earth change, and the four seasons are formed. Tang and Wu made revolutions, which conformed to Heaven and responded to man. The time of change is great!" Because change is the unity of opposites, it is evolution. Nature has its own unity of opposites, evolving into the four seasons; man and nature also have their unity of opposites, which is completed in revolution. Nature worshipers, in their essence, forget their own existence and have never established a correct relationship with nature. Consequently, when reflected in literature, it is bound to be full of the spirit of pantheism. The spirit of pantheism in the description of nature in literature is not only very obvious in Chinese literature, but also very prosperous in European literature in the nineteenth century. We can easily understand this by picking someone at random.</p>
<p>For example, the English Lake Poet Wordsworth, in his collection of lyrical poems, almost entirely sings of nature. Rainbows, daffodils, skylarks, butterflies, cuckoos, primroses on rocks, springs, robin redbreasts chasing butterflies, etc., what he sings of are all things in the natural world, and he entrusts them with feelings of praise, almost like the Chinese pastoral poet Tao Qian. Coleridge said that in the first year he worked with Wordsworth, they often used the two major elements of poetry as the subject of their conversations, namely, faithfully depicting the truth of nature to make the reader sympathize, and arousing strange interest by using the changing colors of imagination. These are the two kinds of power in their poetry. He also said: "In Wordsworth, the purpose of writing poetry is to arouse the attention of people under the anesthesia of habit, to call people to feel the beauty and mystery of the world in front of us, to feel the wonder of everyday things, and to arouse a kind of supernatural feeling" (see Coleridge: Biographia literaria). The so-called supernatural feeling here is the idea of God. It can be seen that his attitude towards nature is pantheistic. His short poem "Rainbow" says it like this:</p>
<p>"My heart leaps up when I behold</p>
<p>A rainbow in the sky:</p>
<p>So was it when my life began;</p>
<p>So is it now I am a man;</p>
<p>So be it when I shall grow old,</p>
<p>Or let me die!</p>
<p>The Child is father of the Man;</p>
<p>And I could wish my days to be</p>
<p>Bound each to each by natural piety."</p>
<p>Also, in "Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey"</p>
<p>For I have learned</p>
<p>To look on nature, not as in the hour</p>
<p>Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes</p>
<p>The still, sad music of humanity,</p>
<p>Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power</p>
<p>To chasten and subdue. And I have felt</p>
<p>A presence that disturbs me with the joy</p>
<p>Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime</p>
<p>Of something far more deeply interfused,</p>
<p>Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</p>
<p>And the round ocean and the living air,</p>
<p>And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;</p>
<p>A motion and a spirit, that impels</p>
<p>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</p>
<p>And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still</p>
<p>A lover of the meadows and the woods,</p>
<p>And mountains; and of all that we behold</p>
<p>From this green earth; of all the mighty world</p>
<p>Of eye and ear,—both what they half create,</p>
<p>And what perceive; well pleased to recognise</p>
<p>In nature and the language of the sense,</p>
<p>The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,</p>
<p>The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul</p>
<p>Of all my moral being."</p>
<p>From these poems, nature, God, and eternity have already become a trinity; only man is small and momentary. But is man really small and momentary? No, human history shows that man is by no means as weak and incompetent as the poet imagines. In many places, man is the master of nature, the creator of nature. It is man who introduces the electricity in nature into proper use. It is man who gives appropriate regulation to the light and heat in nature. Only those who can bravely look directly at the human world can also correctly understand nature and correctly establish the relationship between man and nature. Therefore, even if he is not born in an era when human power can overcome nature, if he is a singer of human life, he will never surrender to nature or bow down before nature. The Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu, no matter how much suffering he went through, did not worship nature as a god in his poems, because he was unwilling to escape the human world and go to the bosom of nature to seek the comfort of nature, let alone deify nature. The nature he describes in his poems is all placed under the power of man. For example: "How is Mount Tai? The green of Qi and Lu is endless. The magic of creation gathers its beauty, and yin and yang split the dawn. Stirring the chest, clouds rise from the layers, and the eyes tear as birds return. I will ascend to the summit and overlook all the mountains." This shows the attitude that even with the magic of nature, human power is enough to overcome it. Even if not, he writes about nature because of people and events, as a kind of background. For example, a poem in Qiang Village says: "The red clouds are towering in the west. The setting sun is level with the ground. The thatched door is filled with birds and sparrows, and the returning traveler has traveled a thousand miles. Wife and children are surprised that I am here, and after the shock, they wipe away their tears. The world is chaotic and suffered a great disaster, and it is accidental that I have returned alive. Neighbors fill the walls, sighing and sobbing. The night is late and the candle is lit, and we look at each other as if in a dream." Another example is Baisha Ferry: "The perilous road follows the Yangtze River, and the ferry is at the bottom of a steep bank. The boats are staggered, and the people are like clouds in the sky. The sky is closed outside the wilderness, and it is late in the middle of the stream. My horse neighs to the north, and the mountain monkeys call to each other. The water is clear and the stones are rugged, and the sand is white and the beach is vast. I wash away my sorrows and pains, and I am relieved of my many diseases. The high walls stand against the steep cliffs, and the turbulent waves are even more chaotic. Facing the wind, I still turn my head and sigh three times." There is no deification of nature in any of these. As in Baisha Ferry, the poem shows the posture of the struggle between man and nature. Or else, he returns nature to its original appearance. For example, the poem "Wild Hope": "The clear autumn looks boundless, and the distant shadows rise. The distant water is clear and clean, and the lonely city is hidden in the mist. The leaves are sparse and the wind blows them down, and the mountains turn and the sun first sets. Why does the solitary crane return so late? The dusk crows are already filling the forest."</p>
<p>Life Sketches by Jie Ren</p>
<p>When I was little, I often loved to run to the beach to catch crabs. I don't know how many times I was scolded by my mother for catching crabs, because I always came back covered in mud. It was always a disappointing thing to be scolded after returning home excitedly with crabs. But scolding is scolding, I still go to catch crabs. That stubbornness made my loving mother suffer a lot.</p>
<p>But I have to say, this is mostly because my home is too close to the beach. When I go out to play, I unconsciously play on the beach. When I saw those crabs walking sideways, I naturally had the idea of catching them back, so I started to catch them.</p>
<p>Each time, in addition to getting covered in mud, I also brought back a can of prisoners. Those things were imprisoned together in the can, climbing frantically, trying to break out of this cage. The sharp claws scratched the iron can, making a rattling sound, as if preparing to break through it. But where could they escape to? They were still in that iron can. Seeing this, I smiled triumphantly. As for how to dispose of those things? Sometimes I kept them in a small jar, but keeping that kind of thing was meaningless after all, because that kind of crab didn't have a delicious taste that you could chew on, so before long, I lost interest and threw them away. Sometimes I played with them, arbitrarily putting them to death, and I was like a demon king wielding the power of life and death. Now, when I think back to my cruel mood at that time, I can't help but be horrified. But thinking carefully, that's also very common. There are many things in human society that are ten thousand times more cruel than this! This is still a small matter.</p>
<p>Speaking of the method of catching, it is very simple and also very clever. How do you catch those living things? It is only with a hemp rope. The method is to first make a noose at one end of the rope, and put it on the mouth of the crab hole. The person silently ambushes behind the rope. Once the crab's body is exposed at the mouth of the hole, immediately pull the hemp rope with force, and the crab is immediately pulled out of the hole. At that time, even if it is half dead from the fall, it will be dizzy and not know the east, west, south, or north. To be honest, it is fine if you don't fall into that noose, but once you fall into that noose, you don't have to think about escaping.</p>
<p>This trick is very similar to the "tripping rope" often mentioned in old novels. Many heroes and good men often fall into the tripping rope, so that they have no use for their martial arts. Thinking of the crab being caught, isn't it the same? However, people who are accustomed to using this kind of trick are ultimately despicable and unworthy!</p>
<p>Now I am an adult, and I have been muddling through in this society, so that kind of plaything has naturally been abandoned, and I will no longer have that kind of interest. But I still often think, I am even more aware that I am also a crab now! In front of me, there are many nooses, waiting for me to jump in. Or will my fate be even more terrible than that of the crab?</p>
<p>Noble's Wine, Poor's Tears by Huang Shiying</p>
<p>No One Knows (1) by Hugh Walpole, translated by He Wei</p>
<p>George Willard glanced around very quickly. He got up from the desk in the office of the Winesburg Eagle and ran out through the back door in a hurry. The night was warm and dark. Although it was not yet eight o'clock, the alley behind the newspaper office was already pitch black. A group of mules tied to wooden stakes in the nearby darkness were trampling on the hard, muddy ground. A cat jumped out from George Willard's feet and fled into the night. The young man was a little timid. He had been doing things all day as if he had been knocked unconscious. In the alley, he trembled as if frightened.</p>
<p>In the darkness, George Willard walked along the alley very vigilantly. The back doors of the Winesburg shops were still open, and he could see people sitting under the lights. The landlady of the hotel, Mrs. Willie, was standing next to the counter of the Maplebaum Toy Store, with a basket hanging on her arm. Serving her was the clerk, Curt Grimm. He was leaning against the counter, speaking very attentively.</p>
<p>George Willard crouched down and jumped over the light that spilled out from the doorway. He began to run in the darkness. Behind the hotel of Ed Griffith, Gilly Boter, the town's old drunkard, was sleeping soundly on the ground. He staggered across the drunk's outstretched leg, laughing intermittently.</p>
<p>He had already started an adventure. All day he had been trying to make up his mind to carry out this adventure, and now he had already started. Since six o'clock, he had been sitting in the office of the Winesburg Eagle thinking about this matter.</p>
<p>But he had not made a decision. He just jumped up, hurried past Will Heyde, who was doing proofreading in the composing room, and ran along the alley.</p>
<p>George Willard ran across one street after another. He avoided the people who passed by him. He crossed many streets one after another. When he ran past a street lamp, he pulled down his hat to cover his face. He dared not think. There was a kind of terror in his heart, but it was fresh. He was afraid that the adventure he had started would be hindered, that he would lose courage, and that he would retreat.</p>
<p>He found Louise Trunnion in the kitchen of her father's house. She was close to a kerosene lamp, washing dishes. She was standing behind the lattice door in the small, shed-like kitchen at the back of the house. George Willard stopped against a fence, trying to stop his body from trembling. Only a potato field separated him from Munson's. After five minutes, he was able to bring himself to call her. "Louise! Oh, Louise!" he called. The call choked in his throat, and his voice became a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement: Discussing the Flattery of Officials by Chui</p>
<p>Officials were called parents in the autocratic era, but in the Republican era, they are public servants. Parents can be flattered, but public servants do not need to be flattered. However, although the political system has changed, the customs remain. If you don't believe me, please look at the recent ban from the Henan Provincial Government. Not only is Henan like this, but I think other provinces are also like this.</p>
<p>Recently, the Henan Provincial Government stated that the gentry and people of various counties often fabricate false words to publish in newspapers for the current county magistrate, praising his merits and virtues, or establishing monuments to his virtuous administration. Even some county government officials are also listed among them, hoping to gain favor with their superiors. Whenever the county magistrate is transferred, they falsely borrow names and make excuses to retain him, which is actually overstepping their authority, interfering, and corrupting officialdom. Therefore, a special order has been issued to all counties to strictly investigate and prohibit such actions.</p>
<p>Flattering officials was originally a kind of social skill between officials and gentry, so flattering officials is not necessarily an evil act. However, the first condition is that the official must be good, and the gentry must also be good. However, good officials are not easy to obtain. If they are good officials, they do not want people to flatter them. And good gentry are also not easy to obtain. If they are good gentry, they will definitely not be willing to flatter officials. Therefore, flattering officials is a kind of collusion between officials and gentry, deceiving superiors and oppressing subordinates.</p>
<p>Officials use the power of the gentry to embezzle and pervert the law, and the gentry use the authority of officials to exploit the people. Therefore, officials and gentry become united, and the local area suffers greatly. Because if officials do not have the gentry as their accomplices, they dare not do evil. If the gentry do not have the officials as their protectors, they also dare not do evil. When officials and gentry unite, then embezzlement, perversion of the law, and exploitation of the people can be done without any restrictions. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen wanted to overthrow the local tyrants and evil gentry and eradicate the corrupt officials, precisely because of this reason, because the gentry will not be greedy without officials, and the gentry will not be evil without officials.</p>
<p>Originally, there were only the people below the officials, and only the officials above the people. Now, another kind of class is created between the officials and the people, called the gentry. What is this for? In the Manchu Qing Dynasty, there were retired high officials and scholars who had passed the imperial examinations. In terms of their qualifications, they surpassed the common people. In terms of their official rank, they had no duties. Calling them gentry or scholars was perhaps appropriate. Now it is the Republican era. Those who are in office are officials, and those who are retired are common people. There is no such thing as gentry. The so-called gentry today are flies and dogs, their power is overwhelming, they are neither officials nor people, and they monopolize litigation and exploit the people. This is the business that such people specialize in.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, how many years has it been? The more the evil gentry are suppressed, the more they become. The more the corrupt officials are eradicated, the more severe they become. The reason why our country's politics cannot be clear and the local order is increasingly corrupt is because of this reason. Therefore, there are those who praise the merits and virtues of the current officials, and there are those who build monuments to the virtuous administration of the officials who are about to leave office. This kind of flattering situation fully demonstrates the evidence of collusion between officials and gentry. Therefore, if the local tyrants and evil gentry are not eradicated, the corrupt officials will never disappear. If the corrupt officials do not disappear, how can we hope for clear politics?</p>
<p>Eastern Travel Notes by Ice Flow</p>
<p>Living in Tokyo</p>
<p>Friends, now I want to talk to you about living in Tokyo. I guarantee that you will find this interesting if you come. We are usually accustomed to living in Shanghai's Sino-Western houses. Once we run to Japan and see these completely different houses, we will definitely find them interesting, although sometimes you will feel a lot of inconvenience.</p>
<p>We all know that Japan is often hit by earthquakes and storms, so except for banks, department stores, agency offices, and the residences of a few capitalists, they are all low wooden houses. The roofs are also made of corrugated iron instead of tiles to reduce the danger. In this way, even if the house collapses, it is much safer than a brick and tile house. However, this kind of wooden house can last for a hundred years or more, because their wood is strong and will not corrode even after being exposed to rain. At the same time, the people who live there are very careful. Their walls are made of paper, and the doors are made of a piece of glass and thin paper. When we walk inside and close the door, we find that we are surrounded by paper walls and cannot find a way out. In fact, every paper wall is a door. We live in this place, so we must be very careful. When we first come, we really feel unaccustomed. If we are not careful, we will poke a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>Inside the house, the floor is covered with mats. They calculate the size of the house in units of how many mats. The room is empty. There are no tables, benches, or beds. What there is, is only a low table that is not even a foot high. That is used for eating. Reading and writing are also done here. On the wall of each room, there is a "closet." We put all the boxes, clothes, and bedding inside. At night, we take them out to sleep. Usually, we close the door, and it is the same as the wall. Some houses have a shrine, which the Japanese treat with the utmost respect. If we sit with our buttocks facing it, they will be unhappy.</p>
<p>There is also something that we are not accustomed to, and that is wearing shoes. It is not necessary to say that we have to take off our shoes as soon as we enter the door. Even inside the house, we have to wear several pairs of slippers. Because there are mats in the room, we are of course barefoot. When we leave the room to go to the aisle, we have to wear slippers. For example, when we go from the second floor to the toilet downstairs, we have to change slippers three times: one pair when we go down the stairs, we cannot wear them when we pass through the dining room downstairs, and we have to wear another pair after passing through the dining room. We have to change another pair when we enter the toilet. It is really too much trouble, but if we don't do this, we cannot keep the room clean.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Chinese students have three kinds of places to live: boarding houses, rented rooms, and rented houses. A boarding house is a kind of hotel. You must eat their meals. It usually costs about 30 yuan per month. There are maids to serve you. It is not worthwhile for people who are not very financially well off, but it is of great benefit for learning Japanese. At the same time, as long as you pay the money every month, you can live in peace and quiet. Living in a rented room is different. First, it is not easy to rent a room. Upper-class people do not rent out empty rooms. Middle-class people would rather leave them empty than rent them to Chinese people. What is left are only lower-class people. These houses are either in a bad environment, or the landlady is very naggy. It is especially difficult for people who have just arrived in Tokyo, because they do not understand Japanese. Even if they find a house that they are not very satisfied with, they still have to put up with some anger. The landlord will look you up and down and ask you everything, even asking you if you have "bedbugs" on you. When you hear this, you are sure to get angry. However, after you move in, she will feel that you are not annoying, and she will treat you well, like family. If you have minor ailments such as a cold, she will take care of you carefully and comfort you in every way. This is very different from the iron faces of Shanghai's Er Yongdong. What is not restricted is living in a rented house. Rented houses in the city are too expensive, so people usually live outside the city. It only costs about 20 yuan per month, and it is really cheap to live with three or four people. However, Chinese people are uninhibited, and they often still drink and gamble until midnight because there is no restriction. Even if they don't do this, because everyone has their own friends, people come and go, and it is difficult to get satisfactory results. Therefore, if you cannot find like-minded close friends, living in a rented house is also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The Depressed Market by Le Jian</p>
<p>In the early morning and afternoon, on this yellow mud open space, the noisy sounds are swirling, and the honest and simple people are bustling about, making it the hottest and most lively market in the day.</p>
<p>It is still an ancient-style market, with many small stalls set up with single canopies and tents. The furnishings are shabby. It seems to be a "guerrilla" style business, which can be moved at any time and can also set up a storefront at any time. In the prehistoric era, this kind of convenient design was very suitable. There are also many shops that have already built thatched huts, which are very simple. The soil on the walls is peeling off in pieces. Even more, there are even entire walls that have collapsed. That must be because the plasterers cut corners.</p>
<p>I often see several men carrying a fir tree to block those walls that are tilting as if they are about to collapse, or tapping lightly with a hammer, the crisp sound echoing clearly. I often see people nailing broken reed mats on the cracks in the walls to resist the wind, rain, and sunlight. Every time I see their declining situation, my heart is always inexplicably melancholy, and I really admire their loyal attitude towards seeking a living.</p>
<p>Even if there are two lively markets every day, this yellow mud open space is always depressed, making a person who is not accustomed to this kind of life feel curious and hesitant.</p>
<p>In the early morning, I always have to walk out of my dirty house and step on the cattle urine and horse dung path to the vast outside to take a walk, smelling the refreshing air, and at the same time going to the market for a tour - the bustling morning market.</p>
<p>Hanging on the meat stalls are bloody pig heads, sheep heads, and cow tails. On the cutting board are pieces of beef, wrapped in white cloth. The beef is still trembling slightly. Next to it are placed sharp knives. I realize that using these sharp knives to cut the soft beef should give a smooth feeling of pleasure.</p>
<p>There are people patronizing the chicken vendors, and the fat chickens in the cage are being poked east and west with a wooden stick, being carefully selected. The chicken vendors stare with both eyes, seeing that the customers are just poking, looking a bit annoyed, knocking the scale pole straight on the chicken cage, knocking, knocking. Somehow, maybe just by accident, a chicken jumped out, hobbling with two short legs straight towards the open space, crowing loudly.</p>
<p>Two people catch the chicken, many people join in the fun, and the yellow mud dust flies up.</p>
<p>The chicken vendor pinches a bamboo pole, his body hunched over like a bow. Rather than saying he is catching the chicken, it is better to say he is beating the chicken. But in this way, the entire market is in an uproar, and the sound of laughter is even more noisy. But soon it subsides, and the wave of excitement also subsides. The occasional passersby have the mood of Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p>From time to time, there is unrestrained laughter from the teahouses, choking in the thatched huts without windows.</p>
<p>Then, the wandering people who travel around the world come again, carrying a load of black and old broken boxes, a large bundle of spears, swords, arrows, and the like, and also carrying a pair of strange urns, stopping in the center of the open space, and then beating the big gong and leather drum, and the spears are already dancing.</p>
<p>"Killing the son and putting him in the urn, killing the son and putting him in the urn! Come on!" A group of children gathered together stumbling, shouting, and the leather drum beat even harder!</p>
<p>I have been standing on this open space for a long time, and I start to step blankly on a small path of cattle urine and horse dung to go home, and my heart cannot help but be depressed and melancholy.</p>
<p>"The depressed market! The depressed market!"</p>
<p>On a Raft of Logs by Lei Tieming</p>
<p>I spent a night on a floating raft of logs…</p>
<p>The setting sun had long since sunk into the sea, and the faint red afterglow of the setting sun on the vast sea was gradually losing its luster, dyeing the water where the sea and sky meet into a patch of twilight black.</p>
<p>The tide was flowing quietly, smiling, constantly receding towards the east.</p>
<p>There were countless rafts of logs. Three rafts of logs were tied together into one section, and every five or six zhang was another section. On each section of rafts of logs stood two Malay men. They slowly punted with long poles, and the rafts of logs flowed down with the water, gradually disappearing behind the distant jungle.</p>
<p>The two punters on the raft of logs I jumped on were a young man named Jizhi and Ama Cai, who liked to drink. At this time, he silently put the bamboo pole on his shoulder and pushed hard.</p>
<p>"Be careful, if the water is shallow in the small harbor, we will have to spend the night."</p>
<p>Jizhi raised his sturdy black back, pushing with the bamboo pole and saying this. Then he raised his eyes, which had experienced wind and rain, and glanced at me.</p>
<p>"The tide won't recede that fast," I said.</p>
<p>Our raft of logs entered the small harbor. The trees and vines on both sides of the small harbor seemed to deliberately narrow the harbor. The water was only five feet deep, but it was flowing rapidly with a sound…</p>
<p>At night, the wind in June blew through the sparse trees, and the falling leaves fell on the water and on the raft of logs with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>Ama Cai lit the earthen oil lamp made from a wine bottle, and the smoky smell filled the air. The orange-yellow light illuminated the thin, black faces of everyone on the raft of logs.</p>
<p>We let the raft of logs drift by itself, turned back, put out the last half-pot of cold rice, and sat around smiling, grabbing and eating with washed fingers. We clamped skewers of salted fish with branches, coated them with soy sauce and chili, and roasted them by the stove.</p>
<p>The rows of rafts of logs flowed down the rapids like a long snake…</p>
<p>These rafts of logs were all collected from the forest. The Malay workers punted non-stop, passing through long and winding mountain streams, and then flowing into this calm sea. They spent the night on the beach, and endured the rain and sun on the rafts of logs, just drifting day and night, working constantly, until they safely punted each raft of logs to the lumber yard.</p>
<p>The water in the harbor flowed narrowly in bends, shallower and faster than before. The rafts of logs bumped against the weeds on the shore, and the weeds fell down with a cry. The branches on both sides of the bank were short and intertwined, and the black harbor seemed like a deep mountain cave.</p>
<p>The lights on the rafts of logs in front and behind were blocked by the trees, and they could not see each other. Their ears could only hear the constant sound of punting and the sparse low voices.</p>
<p>"Hey, we're here!"…</p>
<p>The shout came from the raft of logs in front, and then it spread to the last section. Laughter and songs rippled in the small harbor. Labor was joyfully accelerated, and melodious marches seemed to leak out from every dark corner of the forest.</p>
<p>"Haha, we're here…"</p>
<p>"Jizhi, is it almost dawn!"</p>
<p>I was so happy that I almost shed tears. The hot wind whistled lightly in the treetops, the flame spit out from the mouth of the wine bottle shook wildly, and a glittering wave of light surged on the water.</p>

Tai Kee should immediately withdraw from the illegally encroached mine pit and return it to Liu Jiang. 2. If they want to transfer the rights, they can, but Liu Jiang's entire property, worth more than three million, must be compensated at the price. After Yin Rugeng and others conveyed this to the Japanese side, Nishida considered the request to be unexpected and did not accept it. He also stated that if a quick solution is desired, it is best to follow the proposal of Igi, the former head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan: Tai Kee pays Liu Jiang 300,000, and all mine production is sold off. Liu Jiang did not agree to this. On the 21st, a transport ship arrived at the Qinhuangdao Wharf and docked to transport coal from Liu Jiang to various places. In addition, the railway materials stored in the Liu Jiang mine have been taken by Tai Kee. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the night of the 20th, Kailuan Mines workers at Tangjiazhuang Mine refused to go down the mine, which resulted from the cancellation of workers' continuous shifts by the foreman because it affected worker's income, leading to worker's dissatisfaction, and went on strike for one day. On the 21st, after mediation by the labor-management liaison office, the old system was restored, and the workers resumed work on the night of the 21st. However, due to instigation by traitors, all mines have been on high alert since the 21st. In order to prevent traitors from infiltrating and substituting for workers, the mine bureau has decided to implement worker inspections starting on the 24th. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The traitor Zhao Dazhong has established a fake East Asia Allied Army Command in a certain Japanese ronin trading firm in Xiaoshan, Tangshan, gathering his followers to incite disturbances among Kailuan mine workers. He is also using the method of substituting names to allow bandits to infiltrate the five Kailuan mines as internal collaborators. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau has issued an order to arrest Zhao himself and his accomplices Zhang Zhenfu, Ma Deliang, etc. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Dazhong, the leader of the rebellious party who has repeatedly incited labor unrest in Tangshan, has now sneaked into Tangshan from outside the pass and gone to a certain foreigner's hotel in Xiaoshan. Zhao's visit to Tangshan this time is to continue to incite labor unrest. Zhao's accomplices Zhang Zhenfu, Ma Deliang, etc., have also arrived in Tangshan one after another, attempting to make a major move. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau has issued an order to its subordinates to strictly arrest them. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Changlu Salt Transport Commissioner's Office received a telegram from Sun Dequan, commander of the division stationed in Daming, stating that the rebellion of nitrate bandits in Pingxiang has been suppressed and the bandits have been disbanded. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to sources from the Changlu Transport Office, the nitrate bandits in Pingxiang were incited by Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang to form the Universal Alliance Red Cross. Li Xiu and a certain Zhang were the leaders. Anyone with a gun who joined would receive a monthly salary of eight yuan. The method of raising funds was to apportion it to salt farmers household by household. They already had many machine guns and rifles. A few days ago, the tax police stationed in Yongnian were transferred and passed through bandit territory. The bandits mistakenly thought they were going to suppress them, so they opened fire and were defeated. However, they are lurking in various places and have the potential to make a comeback.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold a temporary meeting at 2:00 PM on the 24th to review the draft constitutional amendment. Sun Ke, Fu Bingchang, etc., are scheduled to return to the east from Shanghai on the evening of the 22nd to preside over the revised constitution. In addition to being deleted and merged into eight chapters, the number of articles has also been reduced by 20 and one new article has been added. There are now 149 articles remaining. The deleted articles are mostly those originally in the deleted fiscal and military chapters and similar implementing law articles in other non-deleted chapters. The added article stipulates that the implementation matters stipulated in the Constitution shall be determined by law separately when necessary. According to sources familiar with the matter, all the deletions in this revision of the draft constitution are based on the revision principles and attachments issued by the central government. The retained articles have been passed through the three readings of the Legislative Yuan. The added article is only one and is also added in accordance with the central government's revision principles. It is expected that the Yuan meeting will only make technical modifications to the amendment. According to well-informed sources, the amendment will not include provisions in the fundamental law of the country that are similar to the articles of the implementing law. It is planned that the restrictions on the right to be elected for the president, vice president, and provincial governors will not be stipulated in the Constitution.

<p>(Xuzhou) Commissioner Hao Guoxi recently ordered the magistrates of Donghai, Shuyang, and Guanyun counties that since the Yellow River embankments in each county have been rushed to completion by the entire county's conscripts, they must ensure that the project is completed and strong enough to resist the raging waves. After the completion, when the laborers return, if no one is responsible for guarding the embankments and no emergency response organization is prepared, danger is inevitable. They should be planned in advance to ensure thoroughness. The counties have all been assigned responsibilities for guarding after receiving the order. (Central News Agency telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Haizhou Commissioner's Office believes that the Yellow River dike in Donghai has been rushed to completion with the strength of the entire county and should be protected with greater efforts. It specifically ordered the county government to divide the dike into sections for defense to avoid danger. Now, the Qianshui in Xinpu is rising again. It is expected that the Shuishui dam in the Central Canal will be opened, and even if the rivers in Haizhou rise, it should not cause trouble. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to Haixun News, the new dike at Daikou, on the Yanhe River outside the west gate of Guanyun, has loose soil. On the night of the 18th, it was breached by the wind and waves for four zhang. Laborers rushed to block the breach overnight, and fortunately, no danger occurred. However, the entire Yanhe River dike is newly built, and cracks appear from time to time. The Guanxian County Government ordered 1,500 laborers from the first district to rush to reinforce it to prevent further rises before the breach is blocked upstream. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
