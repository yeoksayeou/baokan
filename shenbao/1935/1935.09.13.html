<p>— 端</p>
<p>全國兒童年實施委員會近有父母會組織綱要之頒布父母會之宗旨一日涵養父母智德。二日研究及實施兒童敎養方法。三曰增進兒童幸福。當今我國社會日趨腐化。國民自信力消失殆盡。荒嬉怠惰。投機取巧。相習成風。若從家庭方面改進。謀已往惡習之矯正。使一般為父母者。各有敎養現代兒童之智能。實為今日之亟務。此父母會之所以提倡也。惟國人對於集會。缺乏素養。都市猶然。鄉村更甚。今欲完成此項目的。要當就宣傳指導。及示範方面加意努力也。</p>
<p>古來有建樹者史家無不謂其得力於母敎而道及父敎者殊少此非父不敎也父敎之所以不及母敎者。孟子已言之矣。公孫丑問孟子。君子之不敎子。何也。」孟子曰。「勢不行也。敎子必以正。以正不行。繼之以怒。繼之以怒。則反夷矣。夫子敎我以正。夫子未出於正也。則是父子相夷也。父子相夷則惡矣。」故古之人易子而教。父之教。委之於師。而家庭乃以母敎為宗。為人母者性恒慈。且與兒女相習處。故其敎易入。此賢母所以有賢子。而賢子常歸功於賢母。現在男女間一切可平等。惟獨天賦之職責。旣不能使之强同。亦無可加以放。棄此不僅為個人問題抑且與民族生存問題有關耳</p>
<p>迺今之所謂大家婦女。往往憑藉男子方面經濟上之供應。忘其應盡之責任。貪逸豫。圖享用。一牌在手。萬事不問。視家事為賤役。委保育於俯工。甚至以為非如此不足以言解放。豈非大惑。父敎旣見式微。母敎又日荒落。兒童耳濡目染。習與性成。誰復能負養正之責。卽有優良之學校敎育。亦無異一曝十寒。於事何濟。故目前救國最重要之問題。仍為如何培養好國民。但欲有好國民。終須有好父母。尤須有賢良之母敎也。</p>

<p>（羅馬）意方以為明日將為國聯歷史上最重要之一日、因法總理賴伐爾將决定法國是否服從英國主張、抑或與其臘丁姊妹國為伍也、衆皆承認英意立塲間有莫可接近之鴻溝、英方覺國聯生存之道、在謀取和平解决、舍此無他、而意國則認阿國問題與國聯無關、聽令意阿自行解决、實國聯唯一生存之道、雙方見解如此、殆無從融洽、傳說法總理賴伐爾之言論如不使意人滿意、則意國將退出國聯、惟茍非萬不得已、則决不出此、此乃意國目前之態度也、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）意人方面傳說、法總理賴伐爾今日將向國聯行政院之五國委員會提出若干建議、如經該會接受、則將送交意總代表阿洛錫、聞阿氏已允予以審愼之考慮、衆覺英外相霍爾之言論無須過於重視、蓋此種論調、英閣員早已在他處發表之、茲僅重述前事、不過語氣較前稍形嚴峻耳、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相霍爾昨在國聯大會之言論、說明英國對意阿爭議之態度、已使歐洲各國有深切印象、巴黎人士認央外相之言論為國聯歷史中之轉向點、日內瓦人士則視此為對法與對國聯之警吿、含有「盍向前進、否則吾人退出」之意、羅馬人士亦認此為對法警吿、其意不外國聯如不能和平解决阿國問題、則英國此後不復與聞歐洲事件、意人蓋達在意大利日報登載一文、謂英政府欲以困難問題加諸法國、不有對意之共同行動、卽有英國之脫離歐洲事件、二者任何擇其一、為法國計、堅强團結的意國之援助較有價値、甚於英國政策之曲折云、意人一致以為墨索里尼决不因英外相之言而稍變其方針、英外相之言、徒使意國愈有脫離國聯之可能性耳、羅馬政界聲稱、意代表阿洛錫於發言時將不答覆、霍爾或賴伐爾之言論、蓋羅馬以為阿比西尼亞問題、就日內瓦而言、現已終了也、聞霍爾前曾以其演說稿示賴伐爾、賴伐爾决計展至星期五日答覆、顯欲商諸同僚、然後始有切實答詞也賴伐爾希望意國聞英外相之言後、或可稍就範圍、但觀察家則覺未必能如願以償、法國之準備為英國後援、以擁護國聯盟約、將至何種程度乎、將於法總埋演說中見之、除霍爾所言及以國民情威為後盾的改更現狀之要求、及進步落後的國家有保持其獨立之權利後、法國所最注意者為霍爾全世界調查以糾正利源不適當的分配之提議、德國對於霍爾言論、亦予以極大注意、柏林日報稱、意相墨索里尼措詞强硬、而英國言論亦同樣强硬、針鋒相對、乃國聯歷史中所創見者也、其言主張實行、雖詞式尙屬溫和、但英意之裂痕愈深、縱極端樂觀者亦不能抱樂觀幻想矣、據該報之意見、霍爾言論僅可使意國已採之態度愈形堅强（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）英國要求國聯以全力反對意國之　武主義法國之地位、則因賴伐爾總理曾於電話中最後要求墨氏妥協、未能成功、故已增加其舉足輕重之勢、據稱賴氏之建議被意國拒絕之後、法國益將傾向英國、撫　國聯、以測騐意國究竟能否破壞國聯盟約、國聯大會中所有各國代表、亦大半表示擬贊助英國、以决定國聯究竟將仍舊毫無氣節、徒受世人訕笑、抑將以其全部力量、作孤注之一擲、而謀阻止墨索里尼云、（十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）昨日英外相霍爾在國聯大會會議所發之演說、其結語日、此爲英國對於國聯盟約所抱之態度、如國聯仍爲有效力之機關、而英國與歐陸之聯絡依然完整、則余不信此種態度將有變更云、路透社探悉、霍爾此語、如認作國聯無效力、　英國將出會之解、則未免失當、蓋其語　表示如國聯在意阿爭議中不能為有效　機關、則英國與國聯中其他各國將重行考慮其為國聯會員國之地位也、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>許廷佐氏經營事業</p>
<p>益利總公司、為定　海許廷佐獨資創辦、全部資本、總共國幣一百餘萬元、營業有益利汽水廠·廠址華德路一五六八號·益利五金號·地址百老匯路七十四號·益利輪船公司·地址天津路三十三號·益利玻璃廠·廠址華德路一五六八號·振利銀號·百老匯路一七零號、三門灣地產公司等、自備益利·益泰·二輪船、行駛滬溫綫、同時代理益蓀輪船公司之益蓀輪、平時營業頗盛、信譽甚佳、由許廷佐自任總經理、許文貴·何錦雲·秦容　·等分任各廠號經理、</p>
<p>墾三門灣慘遭失敗</p>
<p>許廷佐氏蓄志開墾三門灣。希能闢爲商埠、陸續投資、三四十萬元、購買灘地、曾招待滬各界赴三門灣視察、同時將益利輪兼灣三門灣、其目的為發展三門灣、不幸自東北事件、及上海戰事、先後發生、政局不靖、政府無暇暇及此、同時社會亦無人響應、遂致全部投資擱淺、共耗豐備地價等四十餘萬元、此實為許氏最痛心之事、</p>
<p>虧耗過鉅週轉不靈</p>
<p>輪船部份、卽益利輪船公司益利輪、總噸數一千零五十五噸、凈噸六百十八噸、代理之益蓀輪、總噸一千八百三十三噸、凈噸一千零六十八噸、自開航以來、營業不振、　耗已達二十餘萬元以上、益以開墾三門灣失敗、致元氣大損、金融頓戚拮据、同時滬市工商業之整個不整氣、已達極點、銀錢兩業、對各項放欵、一致緊縮、該公司竭力整理、以圖自存、</p>
<p>無法維持被迫停業</p>
<p>自美商美豐銀行停業淸理後、益利總公司曾有透支往來、結欠銀四十餘萬元、平時按期付息、素無問題、自　銀行停業後、對於上項透支本金雖未到期、急於收回、該公司資產、雖抵償有餘、然資本均已化為地產、廠屋機器生財及存貨客帳等、一時無人承受、而應收貨欵、忽促未能收回、以致鉅額現金、苦於無法籌劃、各方存戶上行、則紛紛迫收　欵、遂致無法維持、不得已將總公司曁所屬各廠號、一律停業淸理、</p>
<p>委託律師公告淸算</p>
<p>總公司門首、昨由律師何百謙·會計師蔣信昭·代表該公司公吿云、「茲據益利公司當事人聲稱、本公司所屬益利汽水廠·益利坡璃廠·益利益蓀輪船局·益利五金號·因受市面影響、周轉不靈、無法維持、委請代表淸算等語前來、據此、合亟代表公吿、卽希各債權人、於十四天內、携帶憑證、前來淸算處登記、以憑核辦、所有各債務人、亦希於上開期內、將所欠欵項、送交淸算處、掣取收據、逾限卽當依法訴追、特此通吿、淸算處百老匯路一七〇號</p>
<p>許氏態度甚爲消極</p>
<p>許廷佐氏、浙江定海人、年五十四歲、鑒於外貨充斥、利權外溢、遂努力創辦實業、以塞漏巵、於民國十六年、獨資創辦益利汽水廠、出品各種汽水及橘子水·銷路甚廣、與舶來品並駕、購益利等輪船、行駛滬甌及港粵綫、設五金號推銷罐頭食物、並與鄧振銓君合組振利銀號、平素無嗜好、以興辦事業為消遣、素為滬人所稱道、且為上海市商會提倡國貨委員會委員、此次驟遭擱淺、所志未遂、異常消極、聞現仍留滬上、惟杜門謝客云、</p>
<p>設淸算處辦理登記</p>
<p>總公司所屬之益利汽水廠·益利五金號·益利輪船公司·益利玻璃廠·振利銀號·三門灣地產公司等、均已停業、益利等輪船、已停航、拋錨停泊在高昌廟黃浦江面、所屬海員曁各廠工人、各號職員等、總約數千名、均吿失業、今承辦淸算之律師會計師、已在百老匯路一七〇號設淸算處、辦理登記、</p>
<p>資產負債相差甚微</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨向蔣信昭會計師探悉益利公司全部資產、如地產廠屋生財機器存貨存料及客賬連同益利益蓀輪船二艘約値銀一百十萬元、負債總額約計二百卅餘萬元、其中大部份為美豐等往來欵項、少數為上行貨欽往來、及親友等個人存項存該相抵相差、約二十萬元、除大部份欠債均有輪船廠屋等擔保、無甚問題外、各項擔保品抵押價値、亦有餘剩、故實際上相差無幾云</p>
<p>決定商議復業辦法</p>
<p>許氏經營各項事業受市面不景氣等彩響、不幸一時　轉不靈、無法維持、被迫停業、聞法俟清理賬目、作一結東後、召集各債權人會議、商定一切辦法、再行準備復業、以期貫澈其努力創辦實業之初衷云、</p>

<p>— （馬蔭良）</p>
<p>我最近譯過一篇美國商務參贊安諾德的文章，他指示我們如何發展國外貿易，而最後的結論是「發展國內貿易，就是發展國外貿易的基礎，要外國人用中國貨，先要中國人自己提倡起來。」</p>
<p>友人沈君怡先生從歐洲回來，告訴我們歐洲人民樂用本國貨的情况，德國人民所抽的香煙，形式香味，都不及外國貨的好，而他們却抽得怡然自樂，</p>
<p>我認定全國國民心理上，應該知道用中國貨是中國人的本份，用外國貨定是一種羞恥，除非是不能用國貨來代替而是不可少的時候，這一種愛用國貨心理上的建設，是可以救現在將來的中國，</p>
<p>我對於提倡國貨的意見是如此，如今在一片提倡吸國貨捲菸的熱烈聲浪中，我以爲也應該先從心理建設上開始，如此在提倡國貨捲煙的前途，有厚大的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c141">所望于新聞界者 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>八八節紀念。新聞界諸公。曾各抒偉論。刊之特刊。皆各本其個性作立場。爲捲煙　倡。所謂登高一呼。眾山皆響。本會惟有甚深忻感，宜若可以無需致其嘵瀆矣！而吾猶懷無賡，茲欲一申其奢望於吾親愛之新聞諸公之前者；誠有若家人絮語然，以其見愛之深，不覺獻辭之費與？設使寸心相喻，即此奢望終成奢望也，亦可以無憾乎吾國之新聞界耳矣!</p>
<p>蓋謂國貨捲煙一業，比諸其他國貨業頗有特殊之情形焉。此特殊情形，即其特殊困難之具，所冀新聞界之可勉爲排除乎？試略政言之。</p>
<p>世人皆曰：「捲煙爲消耗品，有幾個人財政也！」或曰：「此興奮物，有礙公眾衛生也！」爲此言者，一若忘其所耗之資，可市相抵值得之快感；抑其極少度興奮之力，善用之適供提神消愁清胃之需。夫惟酒無量，不及亂耳；用之奢淫，則雖其物百利，終爲巨害耳！譬若純趣味的小說戲劇等作，其所貢獻者亦惟調劑精神，滋潤人生而已。則世論厠諸人生藝術，通俗敎育之林，　或瑕疵相及哉？唯茲捲煙，用亦猶是，不必伐功，宜可無過。夫立塲奠定，斯觀感持平，吾新聞界諸公亦　罔恤人言，據定正義，時涉播揚，以糾　大眾此歪曲之意識乎？</p>
<p>目國貨捲煙之業，外有勁敵，聲勢意張；感積弱之邦，卽爲筆墨口舌間之周旋而諸多還忌焉，內有同胞，態度龐雜，或迷戀於舶來之物質而牢不破，或則不暇再思，恒處無可無不可之心境，以爲捲煙之微，隨便取吸，不值小題大做也。在業捲煙者，身處當局，投鼠忌器，蓋有甚難言者！吾新聞界諸公於茲當憶洞若觀火，彰主客之勢，明利害之辨，昭昭指陳，庶免國人之思想簡淺者，旁邊恒在迷途，神經過敏者猜疑而成錯覺乎？本會願迫隨吾新聞界諸公之後相吶喊，義不躊躇反顧矣！</p>
<p>若新聞界所已施於本會者，並視其久而彈力　：此有利國計民生之助力，匪特本會一團　，國貨捲煙一行業擇其賜而已也！</p>
<h3 id="c142">怎樣維持國貨捲煙 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— （汪伯奇）</p>
<p>我是一個不吸捲煙的人，每見人家口中，吞雲吐霧，總不知道其中會有怎樣一種趣味，但是無論在什麼地方，什麼時候，吸煙的人，到處都可以看到，却已成爲昔通的習慣，唯一的消耗，</p>
<p>本來消耗品，衹宜减少，何必定要維持，這就因爲現在的社會，現在的人們，旣已將吸捲煙，成爲人生牢不可破的習慣，絕對無戒除的可能，事實上已由消耗，而變爲需要，那末，與其去吸外國捲煙，不如從消極方面着想，提倡國貨，維持國貨捲煙，也可减少每年千余万的漏巵，維持許多煙廠的工人，和產煙葉地方的農民，而且還可以增益國庫大宗的收入，中華國貨捲煙維持會的成立，就爲了喚起國人愛用國貨的心理，意義正大，值得欽佩，但是國貨擲煙，怎樣纔可以維持呢，照我這個門外漢的貢獻，在人民方面固然應盡國民的責任，非吸國貨捲煙不可，在煙商一方面，也應努力改進，對於出品應該研製精良，對於售價，應求貨價相稱，尤當團結同業，互相策勵，方可有成效，竭誠倡導，却有望於維持會諸君了，</p>
<h3 id="c143">三條戰線 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— （宓李方）</p>
<p>捲煙雖諳一種消耗品，却是智識界份子所不可少的，尤其是執筆寫稿的文人，我國原來是沒有紙煙的，是從國外流入後，一般人都因他使利，慢慢的全都吸上了紙煙，從此漏巵大開，每年大量金錢流入異城，不可數計，看到了這樣的危局，於是有國貨捲煙廠先後成立，</p>
<p>其實呢，中國人應用中國貨，是天經地義，中國人應吸中國煙，也是當然的事，也不必再加以解釋，如今要等國貨煙商來宣傳來提倡來勸告國人吸中國煙，在國貨廠的本身，已經是一椿極痛苦的事情，而在國人本身不重視國貨的心理，也可見一斑了，</p>
<p>所以要提倡要維持國貨紙煙，可以分成下面三種情形來講，</p>
<p>（一）國人心理的改革，一般吸外國煙的，不過是一種崇拜洋貨自以爲闊綽的一種心理，所以這種心理這種習慣，應該首先起來打破，其實目下的國貨捲煙中，也有很高上的出品，足以抵過洋煙，最近看見一家外國式的大飯店中，也　起國貨紙煙來，足見國人心理漸漸轉移，也是椿可喜的事情，</p>
<p>（二）國貨出品本身的改良，國貨紙煙，常常在最初出產，很能風行，入後就漸漸的不振，出品方面，也就慢慢的不如最先的出品，煙味不能在這標準線上維持下去，所以國貨煙商，要國人吸國貨捲煙，在技術上資本上的可能方面，應該極力的改良和上進，</p>
<p>（三）提倡國貨的宣傳，宣傳當然也是最要緊的工作，經售紙煙的小商店，應該使其知道吸國貨紙煙的重要，而明白應該極力替國貨捲煙推銷，對於智識界方面，時常有宣傳品來刺激他，像小册子之類，最後希望政府當局在財政力量可能範圍內，給國貨紙煙商，以捐稅上的减低，提倡方法很多，這是其中要者而已，</p>
<h3 id="c144">二個目的 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— （王季魯）</p>
<p>捲煙雖非食物。而今商品中。亦占一席。且勢甚浸盛。人類需之。誠如米麥之不可一日少。我國初無擲煙。自歐西傳入以來。人手一枝。風行全國。統計每年因吸捲煙而輸出之金錢。不可勝計。有志之士。乃有自辦國產捲煙。抵禦外貨。國產煙廠雖有數十家。所出捲煙。已達千百種。但因年來內憂外悔。國事蜩螗。農村破產。工商失敗。金融因之奇緊。生計因之艱難。于是捲煙事業。亦告頹衰不振之氣象。捲煙業領袖。因此即有中華國貨捲煙維持會之組設。冀謀國產捲煙之復興。誠良策也。國產捲煙在此危期。我人將用何法振頹而起義。時人早有「國貨救國」之呼號。吸國產捲煙。即係服用國貨。服用國貨。始達國貨救國之義。以故「國貨救國」。亦可稱之「捲煙救國」。當今時期。應從救濟捲煙着手。然後再能救國救民。欲使國產捲煙復興。其目的有二。一在製煙之廠。一在吸煙之人。製煙之廠力求出品之精良。抱定　利之宗旨。同業固應有競爭之精神。然亦應存互相愛護之忠心。勿因商戰而流血。勿因嫉妬而中傷。則前途光明。振頹起衰。近在目前。至於吸煙之輩。人手一枝。國產是尚。排外之想固不可生。愛國之心亦不可無。打破崇拜舶來捲煙之虛榮心。剷除輕視國產捲煙之惡習慣。逢人介紹。盡力推銷。吸煙救國。一得兩便。勉哉製煙之廠。勗哉吸煙之人。</p>
<h3 id="c145">糾正「洋迷」 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— （陳耀柱）</p>
<p>竊思我國捲煙業之衰頹。其原因固非一端。而國人崇拜洋貨之心理。實爲重大之打擊。試觀吾國中產以上之人家。所吸之煙。大都均屬舶來品。一若非此不足表示其身份之高貴。此種心理一日不除。國貨捲煙即一日受其阻碍。是以欲謀國貨捲煙之復興。首當糾正國人「洋迷」之心理。務使人人以吸國貨香煙爲光榮。購買外煙爲恥辱。然後國貨捲煙方有重蘇之望。</p>
<p>至於國貨捲煙界本身。在此營業極度衰落之時。尤當加倍努力。出品務求精良。成本務求减輕。以適合國人之需求。蓋國人雖云崇拜洋貨之心理。過於深重。然茍有精美之國貨。亦足以易其平日之觀念。不觀乎吾人日用之毛巾乎。當二十年前。銷售於我國者。盡爲某國之鐵錨牌。自國貨三角牌毛巾出。國人因其品質優良。價格底廉。皆樂予購用。鐵錨牌遂絕跡於我國。蓋愛國之心。人人有之。若捨價廉物美國貨而不用。寗願以高價購買較次之外貨。茍非喪心病狂者。曷肯出此。故望國貨捲煙界。放大眼光。精研出品。務以事業爲前提。毋貪近利而自殺。對於同業。尤應如維持會宣言所稱。必須互相團結。鞏固聯合陣線。不宜各自爲謀。惟利是圖。授人以可乘之隙。致有各個擊破之危。本此以往。直前邁進。國貨捲煙之復興。或可翹首以待乎。</p>
<h3 id="c146">訪後餘談 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— （鎮潮）</p>
<p>新聞界諸君提倡國貨捲菸深具熱心，這回歷訪各報諸經理先生，都蒙很熱誠的接見，發表寶貴的意見，在這許多對國貨捲菸貢獻的主張中，我們不訪作一個小小的撮要，</p>
<p>合起來可以分成下面三種的主張，（一）應該請國人先從心理上改造，使養成愛用國貨的習慣，（二）國貨捲菸廠商，應該在技術上經濟上可能範圍內，極力把貨品改良和改進，（三）在推銷方面，應該使推銷者極力推銷國貨捲烟，</p>
<p>這差不多是一致的主張，十二萬分誠摯的希望國人與國貨捲煙廠商共同勉勵，</p>
<h3 id="c147">祝前途勝利 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— （王鏤冰）</p>
<p>文人構思，每每手執煙捲一支，一吸一吐，亦足以助雅興。不過此種消費品，多由國外輸入，或外人投資，在國內設廠製造。故充斥市塲者多外貨。每年現金流出海外至鉅。長此以往，不謀救濟，民何以堪，國何以堪。諸君子維持國產捲煙，亦願具深心。故甚樂於親諸君子之成。緩緩　語，並祝前途順利，</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>說是爲了美金跌價的緣故，咱們中國每年夏季放洋到美國去的留學生是逐年地增加起來了。本來，讀書還不是「將本求利」的一件買賣！可能减輕「成本」，而又並不影響到他留學生的頭銜，真是「落得便宜」！</p>
<p>可是，咱們這些同胞每年送給美國一大批金元，他們帶回來些什麼呢？這筆蝕本賬可就難算啦！諸位如果一定要清查這筆賬目的話，我得老實和諸位說吧：其他留學生我不知道，我的朋友X君是帶着四隻外國皮箱回來的！</p>
<p>那天，有人報告我他將由美到滬的消息，但因爲他不是要人，據說沒有什麼人去歡迎他！兩年前他們大批學生出國的時候不是有「一番盛况」的麼！現在是意興索　地回到祖國來，簡直沒有人理睬。我想，這或許因　他們是挾着蝕本賬簿回來的緣故！然而我的朋友X君是帶着四只外國皮箱回來的！即使蝕本，總不至於「拍賣底價」吧！</p>
<p>那天之後隔着一個禮拜，他到我的家裏來看我，我和他握手後熱切地問他可曾帶些什麼回來？他嘆着氣說「我帶給祖國四隻外國皮箱，——一箱是送給孩子們吃的糖菓，一箱是衣服用具，一箱是預備陳列到北京路去的西文書籍，還有一箱滿裝着骯髒的破襯衫和破襪子！」說到此地，他感慨地笑了！但隨卽又說明在美國洗件襯衫的代價和買件新的差不多，表示他那一箱骯髒襯衫襪子所以堆積起來的理由。</p>
<p>最後，他說他在美國讀了兩年苦書，學問上雖有相當的進步，但回到祖國來至少暫時要感到失業的苦痛的！我沒有什麼話可以安慰他，我們又談些現在非洲亞洲最「時髦」的問題，他就起身走了，我機械般地送他出了大門，我眼前似乎看到四隻外國皮箱！</p>
<h3 id="c172">羽毛扇 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>在前些時候，我彷彿還記得，看見三國志裏的諸葛亮，對於那把羽毛扇，是時刻不離的。他並不是怕熱而需要它，衹要看他在三九嚴寒的天氣也要拿在手裏：那末可知他這把羽毛扇却另有妙用了。然而，同樣的，唐朝的徐茂公也有一把扇子，還有水滸裏的吳用，亦時常有一把羽毛扇執在手中，甚至每一個軍師都用着這樣一柄羽毛扇。所以我想，大槪他們是用了這把羽毛扇來幫助他們運用思想，籌劃計謀的：正如現代的文人受抽烟，古時的文人愛喝酒一樣右翼曲工之妙哩！</p>
<p>不過現在的羽毛扇，並非是軍師所專用，更不是冬天用得着，而是夏天用來驅熱。</p>
<p>這種羽毛扇產於浙江省湖州，那兒的毛扇店很多；他們也像上海的皮貨店一樣，不過一個是專做冬季生意，一個是只作夏天買成的。過了這個季節，便就關門大吉，等到明年此時再來。或者，也有在冬天改開棉花店；因此棉花是做冬季營業，而毛扇却做夏季，所以這種辦法倒是十分合式的。</p>
<p>羽毛扇種類很多，顏色有灰色，純白，斑花，及紅綠等；不過紅綠是染色。式樣有佛手，雞心，團圓，平頭，摺扇等，價格也由一二角起至十多元不等。那種羽毛完全出於潼門之外，可是必須在湖州製出來的才有名，因爲相傳湖州駱駝橋下的水是鳳凰水，因此做扇子的毛，一定要經過水漂洗，才能够光澤柔潤。並且擴說：這種毛扇用之可以祛除風寒邪熱等微疾的。</p>

<h3 id="c179">小麥研究 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 王維因</p>
<p>（一）研究小麥之意義　衣食住行四者，爲人生之要素，而民食問題，尤居重要，蓋人生不能，　發止飲食，即不能　日不研究如何可以獲得食物之道。我國數千年來，以農產國，農產品以稻麥爲大宗。惟國內因南北部氣候寒暖不同，稻麥之產區各異。以故長江以南之農田，十九種稻，其所種麥，不過利用稻米收獲之後之田土，故種麥稻田之副產品，在農民並不十分注重也。長江以北，地土較高，氣候寒冷，宜於種麥，故北部農戶，種稻者少。故北人食麥，南人食米，而吾人所當食者爲小麥，換言之，小麥幾可代表麥類。是佃吾人欲研究糧食問題，不可不先研究小麥也。</p>
<p>（二）小麥之歷史　人類之發現小麥，遠在有史以前，有以爲最初產地或係米素布達米亞，由此漸漸傳佈各地，西至加那列羣島，東至我國，然如詩經中所謂「貽我來年」，則中國之種小麥，已在石　時代，復蔓延至東半球全部，至於西半球之知有小麥，則自十六世紀始，約在西　　五三〇年，墨西哥始有小麥之輸入，一六一〇年則北美之英屬殖民地，亦有人試種矣。</p>
<p>（三）小麥易於變種　小麥適應環境甚速，其性質，易受產生地土壤性質，氣候狀况，及種類混合之影響，緣是小麥之種類亦愈演愈多，茲舉一例以明之：在英倫某處，白麥雖常在一農塲栽培播種，但經過數度收獲，即能變成紅色，設是項紅麥，種植於美國之太平洋岸山坡，繼續至若干年後，　變白麥，足見小麥性質之易於變更也。</p>
<p>（四）小麥之生產地域　世界大部分區域，俱可種麥，但其繁殖狀况則遲速各各不同，溫帶爲小麥最大產區，我國及美國均屬之阿根廷及澳洲所產占全世界八分之　，爲熱帶之主要產地；但南美之　魯，玻里維亞，厄瓜多之高原地，亦有小麥之栽培；坎拿大北部一部份地區，以前以爲不適於種麥者，近年亦　開始種植；極北地帶種植上所最感困難者，　爲早　，在此期地賓，小麥等農作物即較安全矣。</p>
<p>（五）小麥產物，而氣候地質則在在不同，故每年無論何時，均有收割小麥之地區，澳洲，新西蘭，阿爾然了，智利之收獲季爲一月，印度某區及上埃及之收獲季爲二月及三月，敘利亞，波斯。及印度別區在四月間，阿爾及利亞，中亞細亞，小亞細亞北部則在五月，我國及日本則在五六月，北緯四十度以南美國各州則在六月，美國北部，俄國南部，法國，匈牙利則在七月，坎拿大東部，英德荷蘭則在八月，俄瑞典挪威蘇恪蘭則在九月，俄國北部及芬蘭則在十月，秘魯及南阿非利加則在十一月，南澳洲及緬甸則在十一月，以全世界觀之，每年六七八三個月中收獲總額占全體四分之三；此種情形，對於世界麥市，頗關重要；蓋收獲時間不同，可以調劑各地麥產，而無青黃不接之恐慌。</p>
<p>（六）麥之分類法　麥之分類法，通常分爲冬麥與春麥，植物學者不採用此種分類法，但在商業上則頗常用，Toincutn　Saticum爲最普通小麥之　種，其餘較普通者，有Emmcr　Spelt　Durum　Wheat（一種堅硬小麥）大頭或方頭麥　；皮蘭麥爲另一種，磨坊之選擇及　備小麥，必須非常小心，視其所欲製造之麵粉而定；商店之選擇麵粉亦然，視其所製之食品類別而定，故麵粉必須適　消費者特殊之需要，茲再將小麥之主要種類，詳列如下：（一）普通小麥，全世界皆耕　；（二）方頭小麥美國太平洋沿岸出產最多；（三）堅實小麥，各國企俱產，俄國最多；（四）　重穗小麥（Poulard　Wheat）歐美出產，西班牙葡萄牙意大利等國耕種較多；（五）乾屍小麥（Mummy　Wheat）出產較少，歐洲略有耕種者；（六）波蘭小麥(Poliet　Wheat）多產於地中海沿岸；（七）印度矮生小麥(Indian　dwarf　Wheat）多產於印度；（八）一粒小麥（Small　or　one　grained　Spelt）歐洲出地德國及瑞士土耳其產之（九）中粒小麥（Emmar　or　two　grainde　Spelt）歐洲及印度生產；（十）大粒小麥（large　spelt）歐洲出產，德國最多；此外商業十之分類法，有以播種發苗時季分爲夏麥冬麥者，（如上述）有以小麥外皮之色，而分白肌小麥，黃肌小麥，赤肌小麥者。白肌黃肌，則粘質較少，頗適於製粉。或以小麥之硬軟而分硬實小麥，柔實小麥　種，柔實小麥專供製粉原料之用。（參閱日人扳口武之助著「最近高等商品」）</p>
<p>（七）小麥之效用　小麥品質優良，養料豐富，頗適於製造麵麥餞頭麵包之用，故麵粉製品，較任何穀類粉所製者爲多。新起之早茶用食品製造者，對於小麥之需求亦日增。三數十年前，用種種方法請製而成之玉蜀黍粉，飯，及燕麥粉等，爲食糧中之最主要者，現在已入於裝包食物之時期，故除燕麥外，旣需巨量之小麥，復需裸麥大麥及米。此種食品，在未包裝前，已用節氣或蒸或煮，或使醃酵，酸酵後變成麥精及葡萄糖，俾利消化，取食時並不加烹煮手續，是亦近代食物進步之一證，但研究已非一朝一夕之功矣。近代人工製造之食品以滾碾製成之穀物片爲第一流，其製法係將去殻之榖物蒸過，不待其乾，即用滾子碾成薄片，乾後即可上市，此種食物，最近市上銷售之舶來品麥片，即其一種，每年進口數量，亦非少數。在南歐某地土人慣食通心粉及類似之食物，但此種食物之消費，現已傳至他國，製造業須用特種之小麥，平常硬春麥或科麥均不宜。美國之製造者通常用Durum　Wheat爲原料，量適於製通心粉之小麥，　於意大利，阿爾及尼亞，俄國亞夫清附近Durum及南歐之波蘭，因上述小麥，含有漿　麩　，　製通心粉可貴之原料。</p>
<p>（八）小麥種植之將來　當大戰期間，一切參戰國家，因食糧恐慌，均力謀節省麵粉與一部分馬鈴署與玉　　　成之粉，混合製最。將來如有必須减省小麥之消　時，此種代用品，或可藉以救濟：但以麥之各種烹調上用途而論，似無適當之代用品，蓋小麥與其他穀物之最大區別，在小麥之麩　含有兩種蛋白質，一爲Gliadjd　一爲　Glnlenin故爲製造麵類之適宜材料，其他穀類與否。現在世界人口雖在繼續增多，食麥者之數比食裸麥玉蜀黍者，雖日有增加，然由最近以泗將來，吾人必須節省麥之消費一層，現尚未見端倪。小麥之產生有一最堪注意者，即全世界小麥之供給，大半來自每畝產量較低之各國，是蓋因種植小麥，最近已由人工漸趨機械，多數種麥者，以大規模之機械，在較瘠之土地耕種，然其主因，乃緣世界大部份小麥尚係自粗獷之耕種制度將來，集約耕種制度將使麥產增價若干，可自少數歐洲國家之高度生產力，證明此種生產方法，似須費用較大，價格稍高，方呆抵償生產者之各種費用。但吾人之生產經濟方法，决不止此，種子之慎加選擇，農塲工作組織之改良，栽培收割及售賣農作物時生產者更有效力之合作，均足於農作物之生產上增加經濟的效率。如欲以减除消　之方法，使現在之麥產供給較多數人口之食用，則事實上有不可能者。</p>
<p>但有一層可以做到，即增加世界耕種面積之一法也，西歐有多數地區在耕種面積及收穫上似均已達到最大量，美國之小麥耕種面積，亦無多量增加之可能；但以灌溉及排水促進搞旱作物之種植，與植麥於荒蕪之舊田等等方法，尚可在美國開懇多量之產麥田畝。其餘世界別地之擴拓，亦足以增加小麥之產地，南美溫帶尚有極大，示開闢之田地，大都作爲畜牧之用。尤耕蓋及巴拉圭亦有地開懇，作爲種麥之用，將來坎拿大遼闊之土地，與非洲東南北三部，均爲主要種麥區域。我國及西伯利亞一部份地區，產量或者亦將逐漸增加，如能利用灌溉法，澳洲之產麥畝數，亦可設法增加。總之將來世界產麥能力，終有較現在增高之可能。至於種子之改良，機械之發明，實足以使產量日增，如果墨守舊法不知改良則縱然不遇水旱之災而人口激增，產量固定，推測將來，終有食糧不敷分配之一日。號稱農業國之我國國民，更當於此三致意焉。</p>

<h3 id="c180">典型底寫出 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>所謂典型人物，並不是特殊人物。恰恰相反，是個頂平常的習見的人物。這種人物，在現實社會里，一方面因爲是太平常了，太習見了，每每被人忘却，不再在腦子里給記了起來；另一方面，他却確實具有了他自己所屬的社會層底一切特性。可是一被寫出，給無論是同社會層或不同的社會層底人們談了，恍然覺到這書中有自己底或習見的一個真實面影。這是作者從現實社會里，抽象出來，做一個結論似的給他具象化了的寫法。——這一種寫法姑且呌做「　納法」的寫法。如魯迅的阿Q便是。阿Q正傳一出世，便哄動了中國社會：在這富有農民性的讀者羣里，恍然見到了早被忘却的這樣一個人物。</p>
<p>但社會現象是時時刻刻在變化的，而且是複雜我端的在變化的。粗看一下，真是萬花擦　，莫測底蘊。但仔細觀察起來，每個現象，不特相互關聯，不可割分，目歸帶於同一方向，可沒落，或興起，爲同一個目的而動。天才的作家，能在這現象的動態中，把握到其發展的必然性，塑鑄出秉有一種可能發生的性格的人物來。這種人物，　一送出眼前的現實社會，也許會給讀者看個特殊人物，使讀者不信世界上竟會有這樣人物。但時間在必然的法則下，把那些呌人發生懷疑這人物底存在的條件淘汰了，這個被塑製的人物，一步近一步的生動起來，終於在這現實的社會里，充滿了同這塑鑄的一個樣兒的現實人物來。於是，人們才是如夢初醒，不禁大道呌：「真有那樣的人呵！」——而這被塑鑄的人物底典型性，也一發擴大了。——這種寫法，也姑且呌做「縯釋的」寫法。如屠格夫底巴札洛夫是。巴札洛夫底出現，是使俄國當時談者社會大大地感到不滿的，以爲社會上沒有這種人物。但幾年後，事實却證明了巴札洛夫底存在。巴札洛夫底出現，是屠格札夫從當時俄國智識階級的一般性格里，探出了它那發展的動向，而給它形象化了的。</p>
<p>以上我們所說的，「歸納的」寫法，和「縯釋的」寫法，不過是從人物底形成的程序上說的。不是概括作家創造人物時的一切的思辯過程。作家創造人物時那思辯過程是非常複複的。他必須把思辯的範圍，擴大到社會的全體，至少也得對發生這典型人物的了解。這有賴於作家本身對於現實的實踐底程度如何，又不僅僅是思辯問題了。</p>
<p>這里，我們不想詳論。但無論人物底形成的程序如何，作家在創造典型人物時，有個主要的工作必需做到：那便是竭力省去其不必要的舖排，而使那人物僅可能的凸開的現出來。換一句話，作家要寫出一個典型的人物，必須有一大羣未被寫出的人物在心里頭時在做這典型底對比，使這典型人物底性格，十分明顯起來。</p>
<p>近來看到契訶夫作的一個短篇，題目呌奇特的人。實際上這被契訶夫描出的人，並不是奇特的人，却是個典型的人。那故事非常簡單；是寫一個名呌郭亞夫的紳士到產婆馬雅那里去，請她爲他妻子接生，開口便非常嚴肅的自己介紹。</p>
<p>「我是專門學校的助敎，我名呌郭亞夫。我請你替我的妻接生，請你趕快吧。」</p>
<p>果然，那產婆趕快預備妥當要出發了。他又說要把價錢先講定。產婆說隨便給好了。他却冷冷的堅定的看着產婆說了一大套；「不，我不歡喜那個樣子。最先把價值講好了。我不想佔你的便宜，你也不想佔我的便宜，我們還是先把價錢講好，免得後亞麻煩。」他又說：「我自己做工，也尊重別人的工作。我不歡喜待人苛刻的，我給你太少，我自己也不願意，你如果要得太多，我又要問你的行價多少。」於是二人講起價目來，他衹肯出二盧布，產婆不答應，他索性跑了出去，不請她去了，可是半點鍾後，他終於又回來了，出了三個盧布，請她去，還說了句「講好價錢以後，不許另外索錢。」可是產婆到了家，接了生，向他道喜說：「好了，謝謝上帝，世界上又多一個人了！」那時，他却依舊保持着無情的呆臉說道：「很好。不過，反過來說，兒子多也要錢多。小孩一生，就只穿衣吃飯！」這一業，使產婆看到他就發抖。最後她看到他站在小學讀書的兒子對面平穩的說：「你知道怎樣喝，也應當知道怎樣作工。你方纔吞了一口，却不想想一口值多少少，不是作工得來的，你一面吃，一面也要想想……」這麼着那產婆嚇得錢都不敢要跑了……</p>
<p>在這短短的三千字不到的小說里，用筆非常經濟，可說沒一筆疏懈，沒一筆不集中那郭亞夫性格底塑鑄上；——一個商人氣質的紳士性格底塑鑄。這雖是俄國人物，但像這個論斤佔量的人，却也是中國社會里習見的。這就成其爲典型人物。</p>
<p>但在典型人物底寫出中，最易變爲心理主義的人物底寫出。即把人物底從普遍性中抽象出來的特殊性，儘量的發展下去，甚至把這特殊性孤立起來，寫成爲真正的奇特的人；（如封神傳里出現的人物。那却不能算作是典型，而是「怪物」了）。其流弊所至，是使讀者對於作品中人物底好惡，成爲個人底好惡，而忘却那典型人物所發生的社會底根源。藝術底社會價值，在此便失却其存在。且使作品成爲人身攻擊似的東西了。所以在這里，典型人物底寫出，却還是有賴于個性之社會學的發見。而個性之社會學的發見必須注到以下二點：個性之社會化，和特殊性底普遍性的映出。</p>

<p>— 何爲</p>
<p>中秋已過去了。在這西風將起，草木就要零落的秋天，一些感傷的詩人也許又要來一套「更聞楓葉落，浙瀝度秋聲」似的哀吟。在漫漫的秋夜，怕更要與起「輾轉不能寐，披衣起彷徨」的感慨吧？</p>
<p>中秋是個行樂的佳節，但也是個使人多愁多感的日子。所謂「舉頭望明月，低頭思故鄉」的情調，在這月圓的時候，是特別顯著的。在過去一逢這個佳節，我老是很悵惘的想起家鄉，兒時在村後出坡上合一家人依樹賞月的那種情景，使自己感到分外的孤寂。</p>
<p>但現在我已不再有這種感覺。生活的栗確，國事的蜩螗，已使自己疏遠了家鄉，淡薄了那種對於家鄉的依戀和眷念。所以在今年中秋，我沈默着，並沒有發過什麼牢騷，有過什麼感慨。</p>
<p>可是我却不斷地想起四年前的中秋，像鬼附着身似的，我每天每天地想起那個可歌可泣的，悲壯的偉大的日子。</p>
<p>四年前的中秋，是的，四年前的中秋！許多人也許已經忘了那個可紀念的日子了吧？但在當時，確曾引起巨大的浪潮。到處可以聽到慷慨激昂的陳詞，隨時可以看見奮不顧身的行動。雖是關山是那麼不能飛越的重重相隔，但朝着「漢關飛的雁羣」，它們的悲鳴，使全國人士都熱血沸騰着，情緒高揚着，「從頭收拾舊山河」和喋血塞外的呼聲，合流成一闕最偉大的進行曲，震盪着每個人的靈魂，燃燒着每個人的熱情。</p>
<p>這個可紀念的日子——四年前的中秋已經過去四年了，人們大約又在享受着歌聲舞昇平的歡樂。那裏還會想到當時情景呢！</p>
<h3 id="c183">這里是上海（下） <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 東篱</p>
<p>「請進來。」</p>
<p>醫學博士的中國話說的很不錯呢。</p>
<p>兩個女人，一個細長的蛇身子走在前面，後面一個是短胖胖的。穿戴，不消說很華麗，臉上全擦了一層脂粉，燙髪，耳朶上全垂着長長墜子，和上海一般姨太太們的打扮全然一樣。</p>
<p>「晚安××××顧先生。」</p>
<p>兩個人一齊笑着說，是說的英國語，短胖的話語稍較沉重。</p>
<p>見面以後的事情，自然不必多敘，照例的，大醫生把主顧之一領進里間屋子裏，脫去衣服實行他的職務來打針。完了一個，再給第二個人打。博士一邊打針，一邊問顧客的病癥近幾天是否見效些；如果女顧客搖頭，他就會飛出一個媚眼，笑上一笑，雖不出聲，却在表明這是一種暗示，他似乎是說：「誰呌你不聽我的話，還和你的好人作那件美事呢。」女顧客們若是否認他這種暗示時，那他就不猶豫地開口了：</p>
<p>「那麼，我跟你說，再接連打四針，一定保低估醫得好！」</p>
<p>「只要醫得好，不怕花錢！」也正爲看透這一點，大醫生才故意把原價三四元錢的針價，加到一百元那麼大的數目。針費貴，這不要緊，有錢人能花錢，對於化錢毫不惋惜的神情，還不是和窮苦人把自己的氣力看成很平常的一樣。何况，這位兩國醫學的博士也真給醫好一些主顧們的病癥，不過，醫好的儘管醫好，染病的還是大有人在。你們想反問一句；「爲什麼會有這多人染「風流病」麼？」還不不如問「爲什麼中國會有這麼多的姨太太！」這同是呌人解答不出的問題。現在，博士已經給這兩個顧客打完針了，緊接着又走進來三四個花花綠綠的貨色。</p>
<p>真是好生意；然而這里旣然沒有在大廈門外釘上招牌，又沒有在報紙上登過廣告，可是求治的病人竟然有這麼多！口頭傳說的效力，想來並不减於報紙上花錢的廣告。博士看清這一點，所以常常叮囑着他的女主顧們：</p>
<p>「替我多介紹幾個來，你們認識的人多呀。」</p>
<p>她們認識的人，多半是她們姨太太一類的，而他們同類人中染有同樣病症的又有不少。請想想，一個男人領有四五個女人，難免照應不暇，還能怪女人們私自另尋出路麼？還能免得不生「風流病」麼？她們旣然同可以在男人處多要錢，自然也就都落得來此診治了。這位德比醫學博士他簡直走了紅運。</p>
<p>可是，你們真以爲這位德比醫學博士是真牌貨麼？錯了。他不但不是德比兩國的醫學博士，他連作「學士都沒有資格！他僅在家鄉當地一個中等醫學校里混了半，後來在當地一家小醫院中作了一年助手，以後閑在家裏五年，第六年他乘一隻總統號船來到上海。」</p>
<p>「上海地方賺錢容易，行醫更有利，中國有錢人迷信外國醫生！」</p>
<p>虧得他有個　舅父，從上海回到家鄉告訴他這生財之路，他因此來上海營求生活。而今他當真發了財。舅父的話不是假的，因爲倔的女顧客們常常在他面前痛罵那些中國西醫的半庸無能。</p>
<p>這夜，至十二點鍾爲止，博士一共診治了十三個女客的風流病。</p>

<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>「小翠在身旁是多好哩」。</p>
<p>在恐怖的氣氛裏她忽然念起小翠來了。這女孩在家時還是一個伴，她雖做不了什麼大活，到墳地裏去拾草，幫着添添鍋燒把火的。就是一點活不做也是好的，一個十四五歲的孩子，跑裏跑外的和小狗遊戲，（附近她找不到別的伴侶）有時拾一串白揚狗或什麼野花簪在鳥黑小辮上，把臉翻過去自賞一回再跳到娘跟前擺拉着呌娘說好。春天學飛的小鳥跳了下來她拾回來養着，像母親愛撫着一個小孩一樣，養得會飛了，再敎它玩一些把戲。她一個人和小狗終年間在這些墳菓間追逐。她覺得這個獨立的世界十分可愛。春天在墳　裏開遍了各色的花，她採來一個人坐在地上壓着厚雪，她們心中說不出的明亮。</p>
<p>「小翠是自然懷抱裏的一個孩子」。</p>
<p>王二嫂子不會說這句話，這意思她可是有的。小翠當在父親外出時坐在媽的身邊臉上　着笑說：「媽，我親你」，說着用右手扳下左手的大拇指「也親俺爺」，扳下了第一個。「我也親小黑」（她都是這樣呌着小狗）第三個指頭又倒下了。最後嬌憨的倒在媽懷裏說：「娘，咱四個一輩子都在一塊把。」</p>
<p>小黑一頭撞開劈拉笆門了進來了，帶着一身草葉子。她突然從白天的夢境裏醒過來。小黑走近了她的身邊，打一個戰，草撲欏的向四下裏濺，它依靠着女主人的腿臥下了，呈巴不住的左右亂擺，嘴裏還哼哼的發出親愛的呌聲。</p>
<p>恐懼這時已經不在王二嫂心裏存在了。悲傷却補了那個空了。小翠去年還守着她，今年，唉，她用眼看了一下　狗，淚幾乎要掉下來。小黑抬起了頭也像在憶念着什麼。</p>
<p>王二嫂說起來人是個可憐的人。從二十幾歲跟了王二，只留下了一條要，於今已是四十多歲的人了，什麼也別指望了，一個閨女養育成鮮也好，偏偏去年又給可恨的丈夫　了。賣給花國子李二少爺做了妾。爲了這，兩口子不知拌了多少嘴，駕也打過了幾回，可是丈夫是天，誰的力量能勝過天呢。况且丈夫也滿有理由。他說一個閨女反正不能當家立業，早晚得嫁人，李二少是掌櫃的（注）有權有勢，我們全家的命都操在人家手裏。去年寒食二少爺來添土，小翠在旁邊看燒紙的神鬼撥亂着呌二少看中了，一心要習她做妾。王二嫂聽了這貪聲一口咬死不行，一者孩子小捨不得，二者李二少奶奶的潑性是誰也知道的，何况李二少爺家老老少少一大堆，小翠一個寡妮子也扶持不了。可是丈夫不這樣想，他說一少看中了反正沒有法，何况還可以見一百塊洋錢。他打算給王二嫂聽，把這一百塊錢買一畝地種着，打了糧食放生着，將來買上一頭小牛，再雇個小孩子放着它，同時也可以幫助做活。丈夫的計劃十分周密，好像只要賣了小翠百年大計全可以安定了。五二嫂晚上被丈夫說的不做聲了，可是第二天早晨一見到小翠的活潑樣子，立刻又變卦了。</p>
<p>丈夫是天，誰的力量能勝過天呢。</p>
<p>小翠終於被李家的一乘花轎抬走了。一百塊錢也變了一畝地。</p>
<p>可是，這是丈夫沒打算到的。一畝地剛買過不久，便被勘騐汽車的委員，不歪不斜的從正中撒上了一道白石灰。夫婦一人呌這道白灰絞得多少日子沒吃下飯去。有時，王二半夜裏忽然哎唷一聲爬起身來，被驚醒了王二嫂連聲問他時，他只雙眼瞪掙直，待了老半天才喘一口氣「哎呀，一輛汽車把小翠壓爛了！」</p>

<p>— 鼓</p>
<p>標準美人和模範美人，這兩個名詞，着實新穎而且高雅得很，但我究不懂這兩名詞的意義，標準，是否像標準鍾，標準香烟之類，模範，是否像模範工塲，模範監獄之類，若果如此，則凡爲女子者，必須生得和她們一模一樣，方得稱爲美人，否則憑你生得怎樣千妖百媚，便不能稱爲美人，假定欲養一位漂亮女兒的，非預先製定這樣一個模型不可。</p>
<p>古人曾有虛擬理想中一位美人者，謂增一分則太長，减一分則太短，施朱則太赤，施粉是太白，修短合度，肥瘦得宜，但他僅僅是假想，是虛構，至底沒有這樣一位標準和模範的美人出現。卽如古來所稱的美人，但她們生來大小長短，黑白肥瘦，不一定是一模一樣，則誰是標準，誰非標準？誰是模範，誰非模範？</p>
<p>女人，只有美和不美，沒有什麼標準不標準，模範不模範。並且標準和模範，其意義原是相同，但是標準美人，和模範美人，其面目決不一樣，則誰是標準誰是模範呢？真是天曉得。古人云「情人眼內出西施，」又說「家主婆別人家的好，」這種說話，原是偏於情感方面之談，但是情人眼內的觀點，和非情人眼內的觀點，畢竟不同，則所謂標準和模範，大約都是情人的口吻嗎？</p>
<p>色情狂的現在世界，大家忘記了國家的恥辱和禍患，都去拚命地捧美人的塲，冀博得美人的顰笑和精神上的愉快，因此校花，舞后，花國總統，交際明晨，上海小姐等等，如春雲轉展般的出現，現在此類名詞，又覺陳腐，或是過去，於是標準美人與模範美人等名詞，乃應運而起，吾無啥說頭，只有羨慕中國人的聰明。</p>

<p>（三）水夫</p>
<p>就是在隆冬的清早，每一條胡同裏都可以看見許多水夫，推着一隻隻沉重的水車走着。蜷縮在溫暖的被窩裏的人們，聽見了那「伊啞伊唉」的聽音，更加感到冷意了。</p>
<p>隔着幾條胡同就有着一座破落的屋子，一口井佔了將近所有的地位的一半。由轆轤打上來的水就倒在井旁的水槽裏。打水的，車水的全是高大的山東大漢。</p>
<p>不論是陰天還是飛着風沙的日子，他們一樣地迎着風，弓彎着身，運用着全身的力氣，緊踏着堅定的步子，吃力地推着車子走路。北平胡同本來是一座香爐；遇着下雨，解凍，融雪的日子就積上半尺厚的污泥了，獨輪車時常深深地陷在泥裏，就讓那些漢子漲着太陽穴亦推它走不上三兩步。在街一看見水夫父子二人，一在前拉，一在後推，綁着青筋，滴着鼻涕，流着臭汗，推着車子的情景時，就使人立刻想起那些在泥沼裏掙扎着的螺同馬了。他們同它們的生活有什麼不同之處呢？</p>

<p>花枝招展的小姐太太，同油頭粉面的公子哥兒，看不見汽車，聞不到香水的氣味。可是從早上起，有許許多多的人由四方八面的通路趕到這裏來尋他們的娛樂，揀他們的便宜貨。</p>
<p>路的兩旁是擺賣舊灘，舊衣之類的小店子。夥計們亦要你看他一眼他就抖擻精神，用着動人的言語來同你周旋。「要大褂嗎？要長褲子？要什麼，請進裏頭來瞧瞧吧……」都是挺好的東西，價錢屬咱的頂公道。這一個剛說完，那一個就接嘴了。揀的人彎着價錢。鄉下姑娘却在鞋攤上　着　紅花兒的緞鞋，頭兒低低地。</p>
<p>在一個極大的土埕上，人們圍成了無數的圓圈，汗臭味衝着各人的鼻子。這邊那邊無時不揚起了千萬種不同的聲音，叫賣的都要伸直喉子的喊。賣　的人盡是一些好漢子，大都有一身本事，摜跤的出賣氣力，踢毽子的，玩陀螺的，出賣他多年練來的靈活技巧，血汗就是他們的本錢。就因爲這樣，這口飯亦是很難吃下的。玩着起勁的時候，他們喝采，打掌都很熱心，「真他媽的這小子！」他們笑着這樣稱讚他。可是快要玩完時候，機靈的人跑開了，作揖之後，地上只有零零落落的幾個銅子兒。</p>
<p>打草棚走過時候，總可以聽到一陣陣「哎！……咳……鼕……鼕……鼕……乙鼕……乙鼕……」的聲音。這就是唱大鼓的了。她們都是些年紀青青的姑娘，或是失了倚腰支，手指縫裏夾着一條小手巾，强撐着千斤重的眼皮，直着嗓子，由早到午，由午到晚的唱着，來掙這麼二三百個銅子兒。</p>
<p>這裏的得吃，有得玩，還有所謂牙科醫院的。這「醫院」門口擺着一隻方檯子，上面放着二個儘裝着黃色的牙齒的在玻璃瓶子，店裏面亦時常有許多就醫的人。醫院旁邊是一家命館（在天橋同實在說不清有多少命館！）桌子上箋筒下壓着「奉送手相」的紙條，生意亦挺不錯，而且對鄉下人講話時還要顯出「先知者」特有的態度，牙醫生有把鉗，相命的有張嘴，大家靠着各自的法寶維持了他們的生命，至於他們的本事却只有天知道了。</p>

<p>（一）船</p>
<p>原本身子便有點病，加之精神受了刺激，天還沒有這便醒了。從床上爬起來坐在床邊上，呆看着漆黑的天，沒有一點星，氣候很凉，似有秋意了。沙沙的聲把耳朶刺得很難過。原來在下雨，雨已下了好幾天，這纏綿不絕的雨加重了我的心裏的苦悶。</p>
<p>五點鍾時分，玻璃窗外的天漸漸地亮了。烏雲厚霧被秋風吹着向南和多動。黃豆般大的雨打在室瓦上的聲音像一個受了委屈女人的哭泣。</p>
<p>天已大的，把右手搓搓失神的眼睛，從床緣站起來踱到窗前。身子給早晨凉氣包圍得幾乎打寒噤。吟着秋風秋雨愁煞人的句子自已就好像脫離了現實，跌進另外一個虛渺的環境里。</p>
<p>待意識恢復原來的狀態時，這才發覺自已的眼睛正釘着江面上一隻顏色晦黯，桅檣破敗的帆船。那船逆流而上，幾個船夫把篙子用力插在水裏，努力地撐着，這時候，我的視線，雙轉到岸上，三四個裸體的舟子牽着一根繩子，用力在拉，那些給六月裏太陽光曬得焦黑的身子，引起我的羨慕，那扎實，强壯的臘肉，新鮮明顯的輪廓在　都表現了他們爲生存奮鬥的精神。</p>
<p>（二）塔</p>
<p>在那急湍的大江之畔有一矗立雲霄，中古神奇氣味十分濃厚的塔，塔原就很高，更因爲建在那土丘上面，更顯得雄姿勃勃不可一世了。據說這塔已有千年以上的歷史，因爲日子長久了，棟梁磚瓦難免霉爛，而且經過每年春秋二季游客的登臨踐踏，越發險象環生。於是，地方的士紳們都倡議非重修不可，他們表面的理由是：這塔有歷史價值而且是名聞國內的。但據一般熟悉內幕的人說，重修這塔的主要原因還是那條滾滾奔瀉的大河作怪。「塔傾河汜」，這是他們不易的定理。原來建塔的本意是鎮壓河神，使他失却興風作浪的本領。堤防可以不顧，塔却不能不修，這也難怪，中國民族對祖先的觀念那麼深，祖先手創的事業不能不保存，祖先的遺訓更不得不遵從，塔是祖先造的。楞以鎮壓河神，也是祖先說的。</p>
<p>現在，這重修過的塔更宏偉了，畫樑雕棟，金碧輝煌，越發壯麗，可是，自塔修好以後，我便連那土丘也不常去了，我總覺得那濃厚的漆味使我呼吸，不甚舒服，晴天的時候，我更不敢朝那度過金的塔頂望一眼，太陽光的反射，會把眼睛刺得怪痛的。</p>
<p>記得這塔沒有重修以前我於每天課後，自個兒便會悄悄走上那土丘，踱進塔裏。塔旁和尚寺的主持也太聰明了。在走廊上安放了不少紅木檯子，還有十來張土製的籐榻。每逢我來時，泡茶的老頭兒便會端上一壺熱騰騰的龍井。將身上躺在榻上，喝一口熱茶，靜養一忽，展開帶來的書，慢慢細讀，看到好處也許真的會拍案叫絕，書看累累，不妨起來踱踱方步，高興的說話，又不妨看看墻壁上無名詩人的題詩。看看天色快暗了，古寺里的鍾聲像逐客令付了茶錢，我又悄悄地獨個兒出了塔，下了土邱。</p>
<p>這種帶點閑　的生活便硬生生被那些倡議重修寶塔以鎮江河而救黎庶的士紳們剝奪去了。一年來，我的心好像失了樣什麼東西似的，空虛極了。</p>
<p>站在寶前　　　　　　　聲，十分滯悶，想起了過去，不禁前塵往事都付飄風之感。</p>
<h3 id="c189">秋窗絮語 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 赤子</p>
<p>自小喜歡糖菓，現在看未三十，已是滿口蛀牙了；但是愛糖菓如故。這個癖性的養成，一半也是我祖母太溺愛我的緣故。她五十歲那年才見到孫兒。父親有時見我太放縱了，笑着對祖母說：「這孩子要給你弄壞了。」但是祖母的回答：「你爲什麼不多生幾個孩子呢？」</p>
<p>孩子衹要有人撐出頭，他就會無法無天地幹出來的。我家院子裏有三株桂樹，節屆中秋，滿院生香。好像是我家的廚子吧，他誑我桂花味甜的。一天我竟扶了梯子上樹採桂花了，幸虧沒有闖禍，不過我嘗過那苦澀的花朶，每天扭着祖母要甜的桂花。後來母親想出她小時候在母家做過的玩意兒———做桂花糖。</p>
<p>讀者們恐怕從沒有嚐過那種又香又甜的特製品，現在正是火樹銀花的時候，我告訴你們製造的方法。</p>
<p>桂花是種細小的花朶，每一花蒂上有一細莖，我所嚐過的苦澀味就是那莖汁，所以製桂花糖的時候要將莖揀去，不過這是件最麻煩的工作。由於母親經騐豐富，她發明了最簡便的手續：等到桂花將要衰謝的時候，在地上舖了單被，搖動樹幹，花朶就脫離花莖下垂，雖然桂黃的樹葉樹枝都混雜任內，但比之選揀花莖是要簡便多了。</p>
<p>選揀花朶的工作完畢，把牠放在產瓷缸中，貯以清水，使花朶上面的污泥去水，用石臼把花朶打爛，和糖均溶，喜歡杏仁。這樣像搓麫粉似的成了一大團桂花糖。</p>
<p>雖然在那時候我就隨手抓來吃，不過這一大團的東西不能久藏。再要經過一層印板的手段，才製成一粒粒精巧的桂花糖，然而藏在石灰箱內，待水份吸乾，那糖可以久藏而不壞，而且色香味俱佳。</p>
<p>印板彫木店有出售，在一塊長方形的木板，刻着陰形的各種花紋，如石榴，雙鯉魚，一團和氣……等，上面有一方同樣面積百極薄的覆板，在每個花紋相等的地方，依花紋的輪廓彫了個窟窿。做糖的時候，把彫花紋的木板用濕毛巾揩拭，（以免糖質黏住）蓋上覆板，摘了小塊的糖填在空窿裏。每一塊板大槪可以做四五粒，把空窿都填滿後，執着覆板的一端，輕輕在桌面上敲擊，就成了一粒粒精巧的桂花糖。</p>
<p>我的姐姐比我大五歲，她能幫着母親做桂花糖，但是她難得可以吃到幾粒。我是一邊一邊吃，就是藏進石灰箱後，也時當偷偷抓幾粒藏在衣袋裏，卽是祖母母親看見，也笑笑不說什麼。姐姐却撅着嘴說：「爲什麼只許弟弟吃？」她不懂得在這個社會裏做女孩子的地位。現在她已是三個孩的母親了，每年秋天，她總不忘記我這個喜歡吃糖的弟弟，從郵局把製好了的桂花糖寄來。去年的信裏告訴我，因爲寄了一包桂花糖給我，她的大孩子哭了大半天，你想羞也不羞，舅父和甥兒搶糖吃？我回她的信裏：小時候每說你幫母親做糖，都沒有</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>好好吃過，就留着你自己吃罷；而且現在更是甥兒們的時代了！我雖然喜歡吃糖，可是吃飯比較更重要一點！</p>
<p>前幾天她說回到家裏了，今年的桂花特別茂盛，或許她們現在正忙著製桂花糖，我猜想大甥兒會偷偷地對姐姐說：不要寄給舅父。這要引起祖母和母親大笑不止的。因為她們又見到下一輩的孩子了。</p>
<h3 id="c191">海的懷慕 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 啟筠</p>
<p>『一個子，一顆憂　的心，一本「瑪爾伐」。』——掙起微溫的海灘上的疲乏的身體，我拾了塊貝殼，在沙泥上，寫着上面這幾個字。</p>
<p>寫完，重又躺臥下去。</p>
<p>隧着給強烈的陽光刺激着的眼睛，凝望着那凈潔的玉藍天，和那捉迷藏似的追逐的雲朵。情緒是靜謐的，靈魂兒好像走進另一個純白色的天堂了。</p>
<p>幾年來，生活的波浪把安定的生命拋弄着，飄泊，流浪，受過南國的春風的撫慰，也曾愛過北地的風沙的侵襲。由桃花鱖魚的時節，轉到菊黃蟹肥的日子；再又由菊黃的日子，轉到桃紅的時節。一次過了又一次，日子織成一長串，像流水樣的流過去，流過去——使我那童年的金色甜夢幻滅了，使我的天真和純潔消溶在人海的苦澀的味兒裏邊。偶而間，偷得一次閑，我就用一萬種怨惱和戀慕的言語，追撫着那個舊夢的消逝。……</p>
<p>於是，我又轉眼望着天。——</p>
<p>雲朵在變幻着：像連綿的岡巒，也像牧塲上的羊群，……有時，又密聚在一團，過後繼緩緩地分裂開去，玉藍天在罅隙間露着笑臉。</p>
<p>海在平靜而深穆的氣息底下，也和雲朵一樣地變幻着。翻騰着軟柔的腰肢，倦了的時候，便布天噴出一口白沫兒。</p>
<p>陣陣地，各着秋天的輕風，波浪把濤聲遞送過來，「秋之催眠曲」一樣的可愛呢！</p>
<p>當眼睛快要把我的靈魂帶進那純潔的境域進，我翻開書。在第一頁，第一段，第一行寫着：</p>
<p>『海笑着。』</p>
<p>是的，海永遠地笑着呢。陣陣的濤聲，也許就是笑的笑聲吧。——雖然在廣漠的海洋中，波浪是辛苦的。</p>
<p>想到辛苦，我感覺煩惱了；於是我將書拋開，閉上疲倦的眼臉。</p>
<p>就是這樣，我把一個大半天的時光在睡鄉裏邊輕送了過去。……</p>
<p>醒來，太陽已經偏西了。</p>
<p>（——海笑着。）</p>
<p>（我也笑着。——然而，我的笑是有着秋天的況味的。）</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) From the evening of the 11th, a strong northeasterly wind has been blowing in Northern Xuzhou, continuing until now. The West Wei Lake Dike, Tongbei Taodi Dike, Fengpei Dike, and Jing Mountain South Dike have successively breached. In addition, torrential rain has shaken the entire line. In addition to urgently telegraphing the provincial government to report, Shao Hanyuan is now rushing to Zhengji to inspect the situation, gathering laborers to build another Taodi Dike outside the West Wei Lake Taodi Dike, requiring its completion within a day and night to fight against the Yellow River waters. (12th Instant Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Tongbei Kui Dike at Chenchang and Tianqi Temple simultaneously breached this morning. Jing Mountain Bridge South Dike also simultaneously breached. Due to the excessive wind force, the entire dike is in a state of emergency. Shao Hanyuan went to Zhengji this morning, ordering laborers to build a Taodi Dike northward to beyond Huzhai Changzhou Huali in Pei County to contain the floodwaters. (12th Instant Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Last night, the Xiaosiduan of the western dike in Pei County breached, with the floodwaters overflowing past the Wuduan. Upon receiving the report, the Special Commissioner's Office ordered the Pei County government to quickly accommodate the refugees and dispatched the Tong County police team to provide rescue. Simultaneously, four breaches occurred in the northern dike of Feng County: the Wanghui breach measuring two zhang, the Weizhuang Taodi breach measuring two zhang, and the Fuxin River Dike breaches at Shizhuang and Liu Daying, each measuring over one zhang. The Special Commissioner's Office continued to order all efforts to be made to block the breaches and rescue the refugees, accommodating them in safe areas. (12th Instant Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Huaipi section has calmed down, but today the Wei Lake water suddenly rose by ten centimeters, reaching 37.027 meters, the highest level. The Yao Lake water rose by three cun, reaching 246 cun, and the Su Lake water rose by five cun, reaching 199 cun. The cause is due to the strong northeasterly winds. If the wind direction does not change or intensifies, unexpected events are bound to occur along the six lakes of the Central Canal. (12th Instant Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Special Commissioner's Office convened an emergency flood control meeting today, deciding on the following: 1. Mobilize laborers from the seventh and eighth districts to cooperate with the first and sixth districts in guarding the Jinpu Railway embankment to prevent flooding of the city. 2. Send Miao Suxuan and Hu Yunqing to inspect the old Yellow River northern embankment and examine the final defense line. 3. Designate Yunlong Mountain Martyrs' Cemetery and Yuchang as refugee accommodation areas, immediately accommodating disaster victims. (12th Instant Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Chen Guofu telegraphed the Special Commissioner's Office, reiterating the order to use legal means to block and stabilize the breached dikes to prevent expansion, and to quickly accommodate and properly appease the refugees. The province will also transport 10,000 sacks to Xuzhou for use in blocking the breaches. However, today the weather is extremely cold, and the laborers lack clothing and food, requiring immediate provisions. (12th Instant Telegram) (12th Instant Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The dikes on both the east and west banks of the Grand Canal had long been in a critical state. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM on the 11th, the eastern dike of the Grand Canal station at Dayushu suddenly breached over twenty zhang, with the floodwaters rushing down as if from the sky, flowing southeast. The waterhead was over two zhang high. From a distance, a white light stretched out like a shooting star. In an instant, hundreds of square li south of the railway were submerged. The Canal Township disappeared into the water, which reached Xin'an Town. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Six Lakes River water is turbulent, and Siyang County is also reporting an emergency. The county is conscripting 20,000 laborers to build a remote dike, which commenced on the 12th. Shuyang and Guanyun are urgently preparing materials to build embankments. The water situation at Qianji in Liujing is even more severe than before. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Liu Lao Jian trunk dam in Suqian within the Huaipi section is designed to divert floodwaters from the Yellow River into the Six Lakes River. The Shuangjin Gate trunk dam in Huaiyin is designed to force the Yellow River floodwaters into the Salt River. The Salt and Six Rivers converge into the Yizhi River in Guanyun County before flowing into the sea. Since the collapse of the western dam of the Shuangjin Gate trunk dam, its effectiveness has been lost. In order to prevent disaster along the Liyun River, the flood control director, Chu Dingkang, has specifically instructed Shi Shaowu, the original person in charge, to expedite the repairs, with estimated labor and materials costing approximately 2,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e5">National Land Administration Conference Opens Yesterday Morning; President Wang Hopes to Achieve Two Effects; Proposals Reviewed in the Afternoon, Proceeding in Four Groups <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The first National Land Administration Conference opened at the Ministry of Interior on the morning of the 12th. Over sixty members attended, with Tao Lüqian presiding. After performing the formal rituals, he delivered the opening address, stating that the significance of convening the conference lies in the fact that the Land Law and the Land Implementation Law have been promulgated but not yet implemented. The Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry to draft the implementation dates and regions. In order to clarify the handling of land administration in various provinces and cities, this meeting is being convened, hoping that everyone will contribute their opinions to facilitate the process. Central representative Shao Yuanchong then gave a speech, followed by President Wang's address, stating that this meeting is indeed in response to practical needs. When the Land Law was promulgated, I discussed convening a land administration conference with Mr. Chiang, so I am deeply gratified by this meeting. I hope to achieve two effects from this meeting: one is mutual understanding and cooperation between the central and local governments, and the other is mutual encouragement and research among local governments. I also hope that all members will fully discuss the land implementation measures to connect central and local land administration. A preparatory meeting was held at 11:00 AM, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. The review meeting was held at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, divided into four groups: (1) land administration organization, funding, personnel training; (2) land surveying, registration, and land title clearance; (3) land valuation; (4) land use and requisition. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM and will continue on the morning of the 13th. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the National Land Administration Conference on the 12th, Central Representative Shao Yuanchong stated in his speech that the land administration conference can be said to be a fundamental issue in the general national economy and also a very important issue in internal affairs administration. The Premier studied the Principle of People's Livelihood and proposed the idea of equalizing land ownership. On the one hand, use laws to stipulate different land tax levels according to land prices and land use to ensure fair burden on the people, and on the other hand, achieve the goal of "land to the tiller." Special attention is paid to land taxes. In the Premier's will, we can find very important and fundamental guidelines for land issues. In terms of promoting land laws and regulations, the Land Law was drafted by the Lisha Yuan in the 19th year, promulgated by the National Government. The central government then planned to establish a central land administration agency, but due to various incomplete factual conditions, the implementation law was not drafted and was delayed. It was not until April of this year that the implementation law was officially promulgated, and it is now necessary to implement it as soon as possible. China has a vast land area, and the actual conditions in various places are different. Many practical problems seem impossible to regulate with a single law. However, the currently promulgated Land Implementation Law has considerable flexibility, and local areas will not encounter difficulties in being forced to implement it uniformly due to different circumstances. At the same time, issues such as land taxes, taxation of land improvements, transfer and protection of land ownership are all very important. In the discussion of the overall land administration issues in the future, on the one hand, we must base it on the Premier's will to gradually implement the meaning of equalizing land ownership, and on the other hand, we must also discuss a proper method for land laws and regulations to make the promotion as beneficial as possible. As for other special circumstances in various places, representatives are mostly from various provinces, so they can report frankly so that everyone can understand each other and seek solutions or remedial measures. (12th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang's original address at the Land Administration Conference is as follows: Today, the Ministry of Interior is convening the first National Land Administration Conference. The reasons, objectives, and tasks have been explained by Chairman Tao, the Vice Minister, and the importance of land administration has also been explained by Committee Member Shao, the representative of the Central Party Headquarters. My hope and expected effects for the Land Administration Conference are approximately two points: (1) To provide the central and local governments with the opportunity to exchange opinions so that the opinions of the central and local governments on land administration can become closer and more consistent. (2) To provide land administration personnel in various places with the opportunity to exchange opinions so that they can learn from each other and encourage each other. Originally, all administration, the central government often tends to make the whole country consistent, while the local government often tends to adapt to local conditions. These are all reasonable and not contradictory. Therefore, last year, my brother and Chairman Chiang advocated that the central government should formulate principles and give local governments more room for flexibility. The purpose is to solve this. As for the formulation of the Land Law, it has been discussed in detail by the Central Political Conference, the principles have been decided, and the Legislative Yuan has been handed over to draft it. Now the Land Law stipulates that each chapter, divided into regions and phases, is to be implemented. The purpose is also to adapt to local conditions, but in the end, it still needs to be consistent throughout the country. I hope that the Land Administration Conference will have a detailed discussion on this and make a decision on how to implement each chapter of the Land Law in different regions and phases. In addition, if there are any questions about the content of the Land Law, representatives can also study it based on their experience. If the regulations are indeed difficult to implement, you can also gather the opinions of the public, make suggestions, and the Executive Yuan can convey them to the central government to help improve them. Local funding is also an important issue for the Land Administration Conference. In recent years, the central government has been limited by financial difficulties, and many important political affairs that should be handled have not been able to be organized immediately. For example, the large-scale triangulation survey, although we know its importance, we are still troubled by funding and have repeatedly postponed its handling. I cannot help but feel regretful when I speak of it. I hope that all parties will understand the difficulties of the central government and, moreover, speaking of the local governments, the measures that have been set in the past must not be consistent due to different economic conditions in various places, especially in the bandit suppression areas, the situation is even more urgent. We can see that the land problem that the Premier paid attention to many years ago is not a surprising ideal, but an actual and necessary problem. This time, the Ministry of Interior is convening the Land Administration Conference, which is the time for local governments to prepare to solve the land problem. We can take this opportunity to fully exchange opinions to seek practical implementation methods. Modern countries all pay great attention to land administration, not only wanting to solve the problem of people's livelihood in principle, but also mostly using scientific knowledge in methods to deal with everything. If China wants to be built into a modern national image, if it wants to follow the Premier's will to thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, if it wants to make the current communist suppression a complete success, then solving the land problem is the most important thing. Today, gathering land administration personnel from all over the country together, we will surely be able to integrate and connect the opinions of the central and local governments, as well as the opinions of each other, with enthusiastic emotions and rich experience, and make a plan to make the Land Law smoothly implemented and national economy and people's livelihood stable, which is also my greatest hope.

<h3 id="e18">Parent-Teacher Associations and the Issue of Maternal Education <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>The National Children's Year Implementation Committee has recently promulgated the organizational outline for parent-teacher associations. The objectives of parent-teacher associations are: 1. To cultivate the intelligence and virtue of parents. 2. To research and implement child-rearing methods. 3. To promote the happiness of children. Currently, our country's society is becoming increasingly corrupt, and the people's self-confidence has disappeared. Carelessness, laziness, opportunism, and taking shortcuts have become common practices. If we improve from the family aspect and seek to correct past bad habits, enabling parents to have the intelligence to raise modern children, it is an urgent task today. This is why parent-teacher associations are being promoted. However, the Chinese people lack experience in gatherings. This is true in cities, and even more so in rural areas. Now, to accomplish this goal, we must put more effort into publicity, guidance, and demonstration.</p>
<p>Throughout history, historians have invariably attributed the achievements of successful individuals to their maternal education, while rarely mentioning paternal education. This does not mean that fathers do not teach, but rather that the reasons why paternal education does not match maternal education have already been stated by Mencius. Gongsun Chou asked Mencius, "Why is it that a gentleman does not teach his own son?" Mencius said, "It is impossible to impose it. To teach a son, one must do so with righteousness. If righteousness is not followed, one continues with anger. If one continues with anger, the relationship is ruined. If you, as a father, teach me with righteousness, but you yourself do not act righteously, then the father and son will harm each other. If the father and son harm each other, then it is bad." Therefore, ancient people exchanged children for education. The father's education was entrusted to the teacher, while the family relied on maternal education as its foundation. Mothers are inherently kind and spend a lot of time with their children, so their teachings are easily accepted. This is why wise mothers have wise children, and wise children often credit their wise mothers. Now, everything can be equal between men and women, except for the duties of inherent roles. We cannot force them to be the same, nor can we abandon them. This is not only a personal problem, but also related to the survival of the nation.</p>
<p>However, today's so-called ladies often rely on the economic support of men and forget their responsibilities. They indulge in ease and enjoyment, holding a mahjong tile in hand, neglecting everything. They view housework as a lowly task, entrusting childcare to servants, and even think that this is necessary to be considered liberated. Is this not a great delusion? Paternal education is declining, and maternal education is deteriorating. Children are influenced by what they hear and see, and habits become second nature. Who can take responsibility for nurturing righteousness? Even if there is excellent school education, it is no different from one day of sunshine followed by ten days of cold. What good does it do? Therefore, the most important issue in saving the country is still how to cultivate good citizens. But to have good citizens, we must have good parents, especially virtuous maternal education.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Speech by Representative Yan at the League of Nations Assembly: China is Willing to Contribute to World Peace; World Politicians Emphasize European Security; The League of Nations Lacks Courage to Guide Breakers of Agreements to the Law <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Our representative, Ambassador Yan Huiqing, gave a speech at the League of Nations Assembly this morning, stating briefly that the countries that are the mainstay of the League of Nations, at this time when the situation in Europe is precarious and unstable, should be clearly aware that world peace depends on their efforts, so as to give the League of Nations new life. This is something the Chinese government is deeply gratified by. If the League of Nations fails to exercise its authority again this time, then this cornerstone of maintaining international peace will inevitably collapse completely. Therefore, the major powers who are willing to take responsibility loudly proclaim that their foreign policy must be based on the League of Nations, and local matters should also be subject to agreements to ensure security and supplement what the covenant has not covered. For a year, European politicians have been working hard and anxiously to maintain peace in Europe and even the world. Geneva, Rome, London, Stresa, and Moscow have all been major achievements in this effort. The term "collective security" is almost known to every household. The correct interpretation of collective security should be that every member state of the League of Nations should be protected from aggression by the collective actions of other member states. The League of Nations Covenant not only protects a member state from aggression by other member states, but also protects it from aggression by non-member states. The key to collective security lies in the League of Nations, and once a country joins as a member, it is as if it has assumed the responsibility of jointly safeguarding its territorial and political sovereignty. If all member states can consistently fulfill their obligations in accordance with their covenant, then why does collective security need new treaties or new procedures to be obtained? For obvious reasons, the League of Nations has failed to maintain universal collective security? As a result, countries around the world, especially in Europe, are building local collective security arrangements as alternatives. Such local agreements, if not contrary to the spirit of the covenant, are not to be criticized. However, because universal collective security has not been obtained, and it is necessary to seek second best, the situation is also quite sad. It should be known that the collective security contained in the League of Nations Covenant is pure and cannot be analyzed. Its simplicity and inseparability from world peace is the same as the security of European countries, which is the security of other countries in the world, and it cannot be said that the security of one place is more important than the security of another place, nor can it be said that the security of one country is more important than the security of another country. Now the world organization, with economic and other relations becoming increasingly close, the impact of one part of the world reaches other parts in an instant. Damage to the security of one country affects the entire world. In recent years, world politicians have often paid close attention to European politics, while events in other places are considered insignificant. Even if there are disagreements in principle or violations of the covenant, they are willing to compromise in order to maintain temporary peace, not knowing that this kind of peace is just a false name, and the actual harm will be seen in the long run, and future conflicts will be rooted in this. The reason why the League of Nations is the League of Nations lies in its internationality and universality. The past failures of the League of Nations are not because it has no means, but because it has no courage to guide violators of agreements to the law. This is also why China and other countries are disappointed. The Chinese people love peace and sincerely support the principles contained in the Covenant. Their faith in the League of Nations has not only not diminished, but now that China is the only member of the League of Nations in the Far East, it is enough to strengthen its great desire to contribute to world peace, cooperation, and security, hoping only to obtain an opportunity to realize its ambitions.

<h3 id="e20">Turning Point in the History of the League of Nations: British Foreign Secretary Hoare's Declaration; Deep Impression in Europe; Stimulating Joint Action by France; Italy Waits for Laval to Express Himself Today <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy believes that tomorrow will be one of the most important days in the history of the League of Nations, because French Prime Minister Laval will decide whether France will obey British proposals or join forces with its Latin sister countries. Everyone acknowledges that there is an unbridgeable gap between the positions of Britain and Italy. Britain feels that the way for the League of Nations to survive is to seek peaceful solutions, and there is no other way. Italy, on the other hand, believes that the Abyssinian issue has nothing to do with the League of Nations, and letting Italy and Abyssinia resolve it themselves is the only way for the League of Nations to survive. With such different views, it is almost impossible to reconcile them. It is rumored that if French Prime Minister Laval's remarks do not satisfy the Italians, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations, but it will not do so unless absolutely necessary. This is Italy's current attitude. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) From the Italian side, it is rumored that French Prime Minister Laval will submit several proposals to the Committee of Five of the League of Nations Council today. If accepted by the committee, they will be sent to Italian Representative Aloisi. It is said that Aloisi has agreed to consider them carefully. Many feel that British Foreign Secretary Hoare's remarks should not be overemphasized, as British cabinet members have already made similar remarks elsewhere. This is just a restatement of previous events, but the tone is slightly more severe than before. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Hoare's remarks at the League of Nations Assembly yesterday, explaining Britain's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, have made a deep impression on European countries. People in Paris consider the remarks of the British Foreign Secretary to be a turning point in the history of the League of Nations. People in Geneva see this as a warning to France and the League of Nations, implying "Move forward, or we will withdraw." People in Rome also consider this a warning to France, meaning that if the League of Nations cannot peacefully resolve the Abyssinian issue, Britain will no longer be involved in European affairs in the future. The Italian writer Gayda published an article in the Italian Daily, saying that the British government wants to impose difficult problems on France. Without joint action against Italy, there will be Britain's departure from European affairs. Of the two, choosing one, for France's sake, the assistance of a strongly united Italy is more valuable than the twists and turns of British policy. Italians unanimously believe that Mussolini will not change his policy slightly because of the British Foreign Secretary's remarks. The British Foreign Secretary's remarks only make Italy more likely to withdraw from the League of Nations. Political circles in Rome claim that Italian Representative Aloisi will not respond to the remarks of Hoare or Laval when he speaks, because Rome believes that the Abyssinian issue, as far as Geneva is concerned, has now ended. It is said that Hoare had previously shown his speech draft to Laval, and Laval decided to postpone his response until Friday, apparently wanting to consult with his colleagues before giving a substantive answer. Laval hopes that Italy may slightly narrow the scope after hearing the British Foreign Secretary's remarks, but observers feel that this may not be possible. To what extent will France prepare to back Britain in upholding the League of Nations Covenant? It will be seen in the French Prime Minister's speech. In addition to Hoare's remarks and the demand for changing the status quo supported by national prestige, and the right of backward countries to maintain their independence, what France pays the most attention to is Hoare's proposal for a global investigation to correct the inappropriate distribution of profit sources. Germany also paid great attention to Hoare's remarks. The Berlin Daily said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's wording was strong, and the British remarks were also equally strong, tit-for-tat, which is unprecedented in the history of the League of Nations. Although the wording is still mild, the rift between Britain and Italy is deepening, and even the most optimistic cannot hold optimistic illusions. According to the newspaper's opinion, Hoare's remarks can only make Italy's already adopted attitude stronger. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) According to responsible sources, British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech at the League of Nations Assembly yesterday is now a question being explored by France. It is said that the French ambassador has inquired with the British Foreign Office whether the British Foreign Secretary's speech contains the meaning that Britain currently firmly upholds the attitude of the League of Nations Covenant, and will take this attitude in the future when there are cases of aggression in Europe, especially aggression against Austria. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Laval, British Foreign Secretary Hoare, and Minister Without Portfolio Eden held talks this evening. According to information obtained by our special correspondent, these talks were not limited to the Abyssinian issue, but also discussed the implementation of a European collective security system. In other words, the important points included in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3 this year, such as the conclusion of the Sky Locarno Treaty, the Danube Treaty, and the Eastern European Treaty, were discussed. As for the British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech at the League of Nations Assembly, people in political circles here feel the greatest impression after learning about it, believing that it is the first time that the British representative has explained the country's obligations on the European continent in such a clear tone. It is generally expected that French Prime Minister Laval will submit a request to the Council's Committee on the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute tomorrow, asking it to continue its efforts to find a peaceful solution. Therefore, the committee seems to be preparing a report on the circumstances of the dispute and formulating appropriate proposals for resolving the dispute, which will be submitted to the Council and then adopted by the Council. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister Laval recently invited British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Minister Without Portfolio Eden to lunch in Geneva for talks. Foreign Secretary Hoare was originally scheduled to return to Britain tomorrow morning, but because he wanted to hear Laval's speech on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, he has postponed his departure until tomorrow afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Hoare, who was scheduled to return to Britain today, has now decided to postpone his departure until tomorrow. French Foreign Minister Laval was supposed to give a speech to the League of Nations Assembly today, but after full consideration with Hoare and Eden, he also decided to postpone his speech until tomorrow. According to the French delegation, the scope of the talks between the two cabinet members is not limited to the Abyssinian issue, but also includes all the issues in the Anglo-French rescue declaration of February 3. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Representative, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval is scheduled to deliver a speech at the League of Nations Assembly tomorrow. It is said that the main points of his speech are necessary for safeguarding the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, and are consistent with the British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech this morning. However, in order to avoid causing war, Laval advocates that the Italian-Abyssinian issue should continue to be reconciled until the dispute is resolved. Laval insists that the Five-Power Committee should draft a proposal to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. If this proposal is approved by the League of Nations Council, it can be submitted to both Italy and Abyssinia. If this procedure is adopted, then in the event of reconciliation failure, who should be responsible for its failure will be clear at a glance. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Britain demands that the League of Nations oppose Italy's militarism with all its strength. France's position has become more important because Prime Minister Laval's last request for compromise from Mussolini over the phone was unsuccessful. It is said that after Laval's proposal was rejected by Italy, France will become more inclined to Britain, appease the League of Nations, and test whether Italy can destroy the League of Nations Covenant. Most of the representatives of all countries in the League of Nations Assembly also expressed their intention to support Britain in deciding whether the League of Nations will remain without integrity and be ridiculed by the world, or will stake everything with all its strength to prevent Mussolini. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles in London welcome British Foreign Secretary Hoare's remarks at the League of Nations Assembly yesterday, because they clarify Britain's position more clearly than before. Political circles in London are now awaiting the French government's expression. It is said that in diplomatic circles, France's attitude has recently tended to favor collective action. It is expected that the League of Nations Economic Committee will be asked to study the entire issue of managing raw material supply. All sectors in Britain unanimously support Hoare's remarks, saying that his meaning is clear and leaves no room for misunderstanding. The Times called this an authoritative and historically valuable declaration that is related to British policy. The League of Nations must show that there are other ways to achieve legitimate national goals besides war. The Daily Telegraph reported that if other countries are unwilling to implement the resolutions of the League of Nations, Britain will slacken its support for collective security. The Morning Post reported that Hoare's remarks did not include the suggestion that Britain would act alone in the worst case. Other newspapers criticized this similarly, but a few Labor Party newspapers, such as the Daily Mail, said that Hoare's remarks increased the fear that Britain would be drawn into a European war. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) In his speech at the League of Nations Assembly yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Hoare concluded by saying, "This is the attitude that Britain holds towards the League of Nations Covenant. If the League of Nations is still an effective mechanism, and Britain's connection with the European continent remains intact, then I do not believe that this attitude will change." Reuters has learned that it would be inappropriate to interpret Hoare's words as meaning that if the League of Nations is ineffective, Britain will withdraw from the organization. His words expressed that if the League of Nations cannot be an effective mechanism in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, then Britain and other countries in the League of Nations will reconsider their membership in the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Evening News's special correspondent in Geneva declared that British Foreign Secretary Hoare believed that Italy would start fighting Abyssinia in early October, so he asked France to join Britain in putting pressure on Italy, and proposed that the Council's Committee on the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute draft a final proposal, and let Italy reject it and bear the responsibility. When the time comes, if Italy rejects the proposal and starts firing, then the League of Nations should decide on appropriate measures, but not in the form of sanctions, and its nature should be economic rather than military. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to reports, French Prime Minister Laval rejected the proposal to take sanctions, which was quite surprising to those who heard about it in the League of Nations lounge. The French delegation recently declared that the French government's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute will be explained by Prime Minister Laval in a speech tomorrow morning. As for the news circulating outside, which is not without contradictions, it is not formal or semi-official. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Five-Power Committee is scheduled to hold an important meeting this afternoon. At that time, French Prime Minister Laval will announce the results of the negotiations. Laval tried to contact Mussolini by phone yesterday but failed, and plans to try again today. If there is no possibility of compromise with Italy, then the Five-Power Committee will only be able to submit a report to the League of Nations Council. What has not been decided is whether this report should be submitted to Italy and Abyssinia first, or directly to the League of Nations Council. According to information from the British delegation, Britain will not let the League of Nations Council adjourn until the final solution is decided. Even if Italy rejects all proposals and the League of Nations Council passes a final report against Italy, the League of Nations Council will meet until October, waiting for Italy's actions in East Africa, and then act according to the situation.

<p>(Geneva) Belgian Prime Minister Janson stated at the League of Nations Assembly this morning the attitude of Belgium towards the League of Nations Covenant, saying that Belgium is determined to actively proceed to fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant, and is willing to assume joint responsibility. The Foreign Ministers of Sweden and the Netherlands also spoke, declaring their willingness to continue to uphold the League of Nations and fulfill their covenant obligations. Belgian Prime Minister Janson spoke first, followed by Swedish Prime Minister Sandler, saying that the remarks issued by Italy on January 19, stating that the nature of the Walwal border incident would not harm the peaceful relations between Italy and Abyssinia, are inconsistent with the current situation. Italy's memorandum to the League of Nations did not indicate that Abyssinia's actions had fundamentally changed Italy's claims. The Swedish government wants the League of Nations to fulfill its responsibilities and investigate Italy's accusations of Abyssinian slavery. Dutch Foreign Minister Graeff spoke last, saying that a small country that has maintained neutrality for more than a century has abandoned its neutrality when it joined the League of Nations, and to uphold the implementation of the principles of the League of Nations, the League of Nations should fulfill its responsibilities. One of the difficulties is the inequality in the distribution of raw materials, and the obstacles to world trade caused by tariff barriers and currency restrictions. He believes that the full implementation of the open-door policy should be the key to the world system. The Netherlands is loyal to the League of Nations and is willing to fulfill all its obligations. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) According to information released by responsible sources, German leader Hitler plans to convene the Reichstag in Nuremberg on the 15th, hoping to deliver an important speech on German foreign policy. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is said that Hitler will convene a temporary meeting of the Reichstag in Nuremberg on the afternoon of September 15. The reason for its convocation is still a mystery. According to propaganda officials, they know nothing about this. It is believed that Hitler may want to issue a foreign policy declaration on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, or want to ask the Reichstag to pass measures to deal with the Jewish issue and church affairs.</p>

<p>(Geneva) Abyssinian Representative to the League of Nations Assembly, Halewillet, today requested the assembly to send personnel to Abyssinia to investigate whether Abyssinia is a barbaric country as Italy claims. Halewillet also said that if there is evidence of barbarism, with the precision of modern photography, it would not be difficult to reveal it completely. Halewillet also said that Abyssinia is ready to welcome international assistance to develop its resources, and is prepared to accept any reasonable suggestions that come from sincerity. Although Abyssinia is accused of being a barbaric country, it has proven its ability to restrain and be humble in this crisis. As for the condemnation of the slave system, it did not originate in Abyssinia. Even the lives of workers in factories in some civilized countries may not be much higher than those of slaves. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinia's chief representative, Halewillet, gave a very mild speech at the League of Nations Assembly. Halewillet was short in stature, standing in front of the table, barely taller than the table. Halewillet said, "We welcome impartial steps from the League of Nations to improve Abyssinia's economic level. We should see these steps as a friendly gesture to guide us onto the path of progress." Halewillet then cited President Wilson's principle of "self-determination is best," and said that he believed that the League of Nations had ended the era of conquest by force and guaranteed the freedom of all mankind. Australian Representative Bruce said that he did not want to hinder the dispute with dangerous words, but only wanted to ask whether any action taken in Geneva would not be protected by instruments such as the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Locarno Treaty, and the Stresa Agreement. If the current difficulties faced by the League of Nations cannot be resolved, can these things survive? Next, the Hungarian representative spoke, urging Hungary to be granted equal armament rights. The last speaker was the Norwegian representative, saying that Norway had previously opposed Abyssinia's accession to the League of Nations due to the evolution of Abyssinia's social conditions, but the League of Nations should now treat both parties fairly and strive to prevent the two countries from fighting each other.</p>

<p>(Rome) Mussolini's confidant, the famous reporter Gayda, recently published an article in the "Italian Daily" to comment on Britain's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, saying that when China and Japan had a dispute over the Northeast China issue, Britain did not ask the League of Nations to impose sanctions on Japan. Now, towards Italy, it has changed its past attitude and firmly advocated it. "As for France, Laval has not expressed his approval of the sanctions proposed by Britain, and therefore has not only not hindered the authority of the League of Nations, but has also preserved it. This is logical and consistent."</p>
<p>It also said that France's rejection of British proposals has various reasons. One is that the British House of Commons may be re-elected, and the Labor Party may win, then British foreign policy will change. This is not in France's interest. Italy, on the other hand, is deeply willing to maintain friendship with France and make the Italian-Abyssinian conflict a local conflict.

<p>Nuremberg - After the Fuhrer Hitler's right-hand man, Hess, delivered the opening address, all 20,000 representatives in the audience stood up and cheered. Schwede then delivered a brief speech to welcome the conference representatives. Chancellor Hitler thanked him and shook his hand warmly. Then, local leader Wagner read Hitler's declaration, first outlining the remarkable achievements of the National Socialist Party, especially noting that the number of unemployed people in Germany had decreased from six million to one million seven hundred and fifty thousand.</p>
<p>He also stated that Germany had gained military autonomy since the promulgation of the conscription system, and then compared Germany's security with the insecurity abroad, saying that Germany was no longer a plaything without the ability to defend itself, but its protection was not based on treaties, but on the nation's determination and strength. If it were a weak country today, disaster would surely befall it. The so-called justice of the world is merely an illusion. Even more, the resources of these weak countries are considered to be under the control of strong countries. Adherents of pacifism are actually engaging in the manufacture of war, but Germany aims to live in harmony with its neighbors.</p>
<p>Hitler's declaration then touched on the internal traitors of the National Socialist government, divided into three categories: (1) Jewish Marxism and parliamentary democracy; (2) the Catholic Center Party, which politically and morally poisoned the people; (3) the incorrigible middle-class reactionaries. These three types of internal traitors initially thought that the revolution of 1933 meant nothing more than a change of government, and hoped that the government would still change after three years. But as of today, the National Socialist government is moving forward and becoming more stable, which has greatly alarmed them. Unstable elements in the financial world have changed their reserved attitude and turned to waving flags and shouting, hoping to hinder the progress of the National Socialist Party, but they will eventually suffer the consequences. To the followers of Marxism and the Jews, we have only one word: we have given them a way to rehabilitate themselves. If they can live in peace, we may not remember old grievances, but we ultimately feel that this compassion is misunderstood, and the result will be inevitable. After eliminating this danger, the National Socialist Party will advance courageously. We are wrong to believe that the bureaucratization of the government is not suitable to solve certain problems, because we believe that the country will be humiliated by these problems. On the contrary, we should do our best to solve any problem that can be solved. Problems that the government cannot solve will be solved by the National Socialist movement. If necessary, the government will definitely pass laws to transfer institutions unsuitable to deal with them to agencies we deem suitable to solve these events.</p>
<p>Regarding the church issue, the declaration stated that the National Socialist Party never intended to resist Christianity, but could not tolerate the church engaging in political work. People need not doubt the government and the National Socialist Party's determination on this matter. The declaration also recounted the major events of the National Socialist Party and the government last year, as well as the economic situation, and firmly guaranteed to avoid inflation, so an increase in wages and prices is also impossible. The declaration finally revealed the major policies for the coming year as follows: (1) strive to alleviate unemployment; (2) maintain the current wages; (3) further strengthen military power, so as to be a pillar of European peace and culture; (4) continue to strive to produce raw materials, so that Germany is economically self-sufficient; (5) educate the people, so that they become a true national society, because it is necessary to eliminate many prejudices and evil forces, so it is the most difficult task. (National Telegram, 11th) Nuremberg, Hitler, in the afternoon, presided over the groundbreaking ceremony of the National Socialist Party Congress hall in front of 20,000 uniformed National Socialist Party members. The hall will take eight years to complete. The hall is so large that it can accommodate 60,000 people. Mr. Hitler gave a brief speech, saying that this is the first major project in the Third German State. When completed, representatives of the National Socialist Party will gather in this hall every year for countless centuries. After the ceremony, many rounds of field artillery were fired to celebrate.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party Congress today read Hitler's declaration, which criticized President Wilson's famous Fourteen Points presented at the 1918 conference, and contained statements such as Germany no longer trusts the world, but will rely on its own strength to survive, Germany is no longer a football, no longer an object of foreign strategy, and Germany cannot tolerate any attempt to harm its power.

In order to counter this, it is planned to cooperate with the East Asia Tobacco Company. Based on the viewpoint of national policy, it is deemed necessary.

The Shenyang factory of East Asia Tobacco has completed its expansion project and is waiting for the company's director, Mr. Tomizawa, to visit Manchuria for inspection.

<p>To the Editors of the Shenbao: I have recently read the Central News Agency's Beijing telegram of the 8th, published in your newspaper on September 9, which stated that the Shanghai-Ping through train was delayed by three hours on the 8th noon due to flooding in Maozhuang on the Luipu Railway. This is inconsistent with the facts. According to the investigation, the Shanghai-Ping through train on the 8th was delayed by two hours and ten minutes upon arrival in Tianjin due to engine axle damage and repair. There are occasional streams of water on both sides of the roadbed near Maocun on our railway, but they do not hinder traffic. I hereby inform you of this and respectfully request that you correct it in your newspaper's column. Sincerely, Jinpu Railway Traffic Department, September 11,</p>

<p>To the Editors of the Shen Bao with Respectful Consideration,</p>
<p>We, Ying Shang, are innocent, yet we repeatedly encounter great disasters. Floods struck in the year of Xinwei, a severe epidemic raged in the year of Renshen, and now, in this year of Guiyou, bandits from Henan are rampaging throughout our territory. Within three years, the people and their possessions have been devastated, and their vitality has been depleted. Long ago, nine out of ten households were empty, and the people could barely survive. Unexpectedly, this year's wheat harvest was again poor, and now we are further afflicted by drought. From March until now, there have been only two instances of slight rainfall. The scorching heat is more intense than fire, and the fields are cracked open by several feet. The seedlings have withered and died almost completely, and the red earth stretches for thousands of miles. The hope of life is almost extinguished. Alas! While the river basins are suffering from excessive rain, our corner of Ying is suffering from such a severe drought. Why does Heaven not have pity and bring about something that should not exist, but does? Now that we have reached Mid-Autumn Festival, no food can be planted, and if it still does not rain, the rural areas will collapse, and the situation will become even more precarious. The strong are scattered in all directions, and the old and weak are relegated to the ditches. We hear of people eating bran and chaff, and smoke not rising from their chimneys. If this continues until this winter and next spring, the suffering will be unimaginable. Witnessing the current situation, we tremble with cold, and contemplating the future, our hearts are filled with extreme sorrow. We, the members of our association, have no way to stop this calamity, and our sins are great. Being at this dead end, we send out this urgent plea, daring to hope that benevolent gentlemen will show extra compassion and pity these hungry people with no one to turn to, and provide them with appropriate relief. This is what the 400,000 disaster-stricken people of Ying are reverently praying for.</p>
<p>Tao Xinfu and Liu Yangwen, President and Vice President of the Runhe Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, Ling Maolin, Wei Hanzhi, Ling Yunqin, Ling Liancai, Hu Kunpu, and all staff members, respectfully bow.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Chairman Chiang Directs the Enactment of Regulations for Compulsory Labor Service, Calling for Total Mobilization of People in All Provinces to Undertake Water Conservancy Projects, with Emphasis on Planting Trees and Constructing Roads <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu Air Dispatch: Chairman Chiang issued a telegram on the 4th to military and political leaders of all provinces and cities, directing them to formulate regulations for compulsory labor service this winter, calling for total mobilization of the people in all provinces to undertake water conservancy projects and related construction. The original order is as follows: "To the Director of the Wuchang Headquarters, Chairmen of Provincial Governments, Mayors of Cities, Pacification Commissioners, and Commanders-in-Chief: It is recognized that labor is an innate human ability, and citizens especially should consider labor service as their natural duty. The accumulated neglect of construction in our country is due to insufficient financial resources and untapped human resources. Financial resources cannot be increased rapidly, but human resources are our advantage. By choosing the latter and teaching the people to work, we address the most urgent task of governance. If we can effectively encourage the people throughout the country to dedicate their spare time and energy annually to central tasks of the state and society as a form of service, then by maximizing human effort, we can ensure that land is fully utilized, resources are fully employed, and all matters are well-managed. I, Chairman Chiang, am deeply aware of this. Therefore, in April and December of last year, I sent telegrams to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Shandong, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia provinces, directing them to implement measures for compulsory labor service. In May of this year, I sent another telegram to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, instructing them to comply accordingly. However, some provinces have submitted draft outlines and implementation procedures for approval by the headquarters, while others have submitted outlines but not implementation procedures. Compliance is inconsistent, and the results are far from satisfactory. Considering the severe floods in both northern and southern provinces this year, and the widespread droughts in areas not affected by floods, the disasters are signs of inadequate human effort and neglected infrastructure. Rather than hastily providing relief after the event, it is better to prepare in advance. To concentrate efforts and address urgent needs, this winter's implementation of national labor service should involve total mobilization of the people in all provinces to jointly undertake water conservancy projects and related construction. The following outlines for compulsory labor service this winter are hereby established: (1) From November 1st of this year to March 31st of next year, shall be designated as the National Labor Service Water Conservancy Season. (2) The work during this season shall primarily focus on water conservancy projects such as dredging rivers, constructing embankments, repairing canals, and digging ponds, as well as afforestation and road construction. Trees should be planted along both sides of the roads. In flood-free areas with fewer water conservancy needs, emphasis should be placed on afforestation. (3) In addition to general citizens fulfilling their labor service obligations in accordance with regulations, all government officials at all levels and military officers and soldiers in the region must participate in labor service as an example. Faculty and students of secondary and higher education institutions should also complete ten days of labor service during their winter vacations. (4) Provincial and municipal governments should consider the actual local needs and prioritize the central tasks of their original policy outlines and the relevant water conservancy, afforestation, and road construction items within the people's labor service plans. The above-mentioned tasks should be the main focus during this season. However, within the same region, the order of priority for each task should be determined, and within the same task, the priority for each area should be clearly investigated and appropriately coordinated. Work should be organized by periods, areas, and groups, in accordance with the compulsory labor regulations. For area-based construction, attention should be paid to the connections of the entire project to ensure its effectiveness. Regulations for compulsory labor transfer between areas should be established to meet needs and ensure timely completion. (5) The conscription, allocation, and return of laborers should be handled with reference to the principles of conscription. (6) Before the end of October of this year, provincial and municipal governments should complete preparations for the necessary administrative and technical personnel and foremen needed for compulsory labor service this season. Training should be provided in personnel, technology, and management. Various engineering tools should be manufactured or purchased in advance to avoid delays due to lack of equipment. (7) Provincial and municipal governments should strictly regulate and enforce the supervision and assessment of administrative and technical staff, and the audit of tool usage. (8) Provincial and municipal governments should make every effort to economize on the expenses for this season's projects, and formulate their own methods for raising and disbursing funds. If it is truly impossible to raise funds or if the funds raised are insufficient, a portion may be drawn from the current year's reserve fund. (9) Before September 30th of this year, provincial and municipal governments should submit their complete compulsory labor service plans and budgets, along with all necessary charts, to the headquarters for approval and implementation in accordance with this outline. The above nine articles are to be strictly followed by the military and political leaders stationed in each province and city, and their subordinates. In short, utilizing existing labor to undertake essential projects is of great importance to national economic development. If the entire country can unite and actively promote this, the great benefits and rapid achievements can be confidently expected. However, this matter is of great importance. It is not difficult to gather laborers and start work, but it is difficult to plan and prepare. How to allocate resources based on the four factors of people, time, place, and task to ensure appropriateness? How to maximize efforts in guidance and supervision to improve work efficiency? It is hoped that these matters will be carefully considered and diligently implemented. Do not treat this as a mere formality. Chiang Chung-cheng.

<h3 id="e66">Praiseworthy Reputation of Young Artist Ma Sicong: Westerners in Hong Kong Enthusiastically Praise Ma's Pinnacle of Technical Skill <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Mr. Ma Sicong, a great young Chinese artist in the music field, has long been highly regarded. He recently held a solo recital at the Hong Kong Hotel, attended by connoisseurs, amateur students, and music critics from various Western newspapers, creating a grand occasion. Mr. Ma is also a first-rate composer, with many of his scores published in Paris. This recital was originally intended to include his own sonata, but due to issues with the piano accompaniment, it was not possible. However, the performed pieces received enthusiastic praise from the audience. After the performance, the audience surrounded Mr. Ma, expressing their respect. Western newspapers also published separate reviews, praising him highly. For example, the South China Morning Post stated, "Violinist Ma Sicong held a recital at the Hong Kong Young Women's Christian Association in February of this year. He recently held another recital at the Hong Kong Hotel, attended by famous Chinese and Western musicians and amateur musicians. The program consisted entirely of Western music. Mr. Ma graduated from the highest art institute in Paris and has a clear understanding of Western music. His talent proves that Easterners have mastered Western music. Mr. Ma is a formidable young man with unlimited potential. It is difficult to predict the future of Eastern music or the extent to which Eastern and Western music will merge. However, Mr. Ma teaches at the National Central University in Nanjing and will continue to advance with his talent and enthusiasm. His future success can be foreseen. Mr. Ma's amazing technique can be seen in his strong bow control and accurate fingering. His volume, timbre, and tone are all perfectly controlled. Brahms' concerto is my favorite and can be called the most delightful score. Mr. Ma used his skillful technique to fully express the harmony of the violin in a solemn and gentle rhythm. In the performance of Tchaikovsky's concerto, Mr. Ma handled all the difficult techniques with ease. This piece is rarely attempted by famous musicians. Double stops require strength, and sautillé bowing requires extreme speed. Mr. Ma used his divine skill to achieve it effortlessly. The rest of the program gave us complete satisfaction in terms of technique and spirit. At the end of the program, the audience gave a warm round of applause, and we were even more delighted to hear an old melody of Louis XIII." The Hong Kong Telegraph stated, "Chinese young violinist Ma Sicong held his solo recital at the Hong Kong Hotel. Mr. Ma's use of the instrument, his rhythmic phrasing, and his skillful technique demonstrate his profound understanding of the meaning and value of music. The most valuable performance in the entire program was Tchaikovsky's concerto. From beginning to end, he was able to use his skillful technique to handle this rare and profound work. Technically speaking, he can be considered the pinnacle of violinists. The second movement in G major of Brahms' sonata is extremely beautiful in terms of the music itself, and it can be considered the first choice in the entire three movements. The author himself later had a sonata in D minor, both of which are excellent works. The violinist should be accurate with double stops (especially octaves), and the strength and clarity of the bow and the accuracy of the harmony can all show his level. Mr. Ma should be a great musician, I have no doubts. I hope Mr. Ma will have the opportunity to hold another recital, which I look forward to very much." The Hong Kong Weekly Press stated, "Mr. Ma Sicong performed various famous pieces at the Hong Kong Hotel on Monday evening, including extremely profound works. Was the audience able to fully understand the difficult performance techniques? I am confident that I understand. Before attending the recital, I thought that young Chinese musicians might not be able to fully mature in Western music, encompassing gentleness, strength, cleanliness, purity, and beauty. I am not overly praising Mr. Ma. It must be known that Mr. Ma's musical attainments, skilled performance, and profound emotions are due to his many years of education and training in Europe. Mr. Ma is twenty-three years old. He went to Paris at the age of eleven and studied there for seven years, receiving training from the famous teacher Bocher at the highest art institute in Paris. He returned to China in 1919 and was sponsored by the government to return to Europe in 1920 to specialize in composition. He is now a professor in the music department at the National Central University in Nanjing. Mr. Ma has composed many scores, and he promised to let me enjoy them, but his works are still in Shanghai. I hope to have the opportunity to appreciate them. Mr. Ma's sonata should be performed by three people. It was originally planned to be included in the program that evening, but the accompanist was not fully prepared, so it did not happen. Therefore, people in Hong Kong who want to listen to Mr. Ma's works must wait for another day. This sonata is not an ordinary score, but it can evoke a pleasant mood." The sincere publicity given to Mr. Ma by various Western newspapers in Hong Kong shows the high level of his art, which can move people.</p>

<p>The Jiangnan seawall stretches for over 500 li, starting from Changshu, passing through Taicang, Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, and ending in Jinshan. It is the guarantee of life and property for more than ten coastal counties. Except for Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties, where the beaches outside the seawall are quite wide and the situation is relatively calm, the four counties of Bao, Tai, Song, and Chang are situated on the river and sea, and are particularly dangerous. In light of the severe floods and disasters in various provinces this year, the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office, fearing that the dangerous sections of the seawall would be flooded, appointed Mr. Liu Yeqiu to oversee the construction to prevent any eventuality. After receiving the order, Director Liu immediately established an office in Baoshan and actively planned and carried out the work. It is reported that offices in various sections have also been established, and construction has now started in all sections. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the work should be completed in two months.</p>

<p>The weather in Suzhou has been exceptionally hot recently, with temperatures consistently above 90 degrees on the thermometer. As a result, centipedes have appeared in the rice fields in the countryside, causing the seedlings to wither and turn yellow. The autumn harvest will be severely damaged. The villagers have reported the disaster to the county government. County Magistrate Wu has ordered the heads of various rural districts to conduct thorough investigations in order to submit a report to the provincial government for approval. On the 12th, around noon, a sudden strong wind blew, sand covered the faces, and the weather changed dramatically. People felt cold in their summer clothes, as if it were late autumn. Spirits were refreshed. Around 3 PM, the hurricane had not stopped. Many telephone poles were blown down in the city and suburbs. Countless awnings and other objects were blown away. Some tile roofs were also blown down.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Yuantiao Guan Zhongyou Hall, which was built on the old site of the Luogong Building with local funding, was completed on April 4th of last year. It has a Roman-style dome, which is magnificent. The first group wedding in Suzhou, scheduled to be held during the Double Tenth Festival, was planned to be held in this hall. At 12:55 PM on the 12th, a sudden hurricane blew away the entire roof. The solid top of the central conference room was even blown into a hole, measuring 15 meters in length and 11 meters in width. The beam in the middle was also broken. The bricks and tiles were blown onto the floor. Fortunately, no one was inside, so no one was injured. The four characters "Tian Xia Wei Gong" (The World is for All) above the front of the hall were also smashed. As it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were many tourists in the temple. The county party headquarters and the Wu County government heard the news and went to the scene to investigate. Around 1 PM, the west wall continued to collapse. According to the Suzhou Meteorological Station of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the wind was a southwest wind, with a force of six. At 2 PM, it had not subsided. The pressure at 12 PM was 755.97 mm, and it rose to 757.54 mm at 2 PM. The temperature was 91 degrees at 12 PM, and it dropped to 76 degrees at 2 PM.</p>

<p>The 12th was the first day of weighing and trading of autumn cocoons in the four rural areas of this county. The goods arriving were very enthusiastic, but the cocoons were not in good condition. The Gongtailong cocoon shop in Sitouzhen, District 5, received 25 yuan per load of cocoons. However, the scales they used were still the old system and had not been replaced with new scales. Therefore, the villagers there expressed dissatisfaction and gathered to cause trouble, destroying the wooden fences of the shop. The owner of the shop, seeing that the situation was not good, immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to suppress the situation. The matter was then settled. The output of fresh autumn cocoons in the four rural areas this year is estimated to be 76,000 piculs, equivalent to 23,700 piculs of dry cocoons. The Wuxi Cocoon Industry Association, fearing that speculative cocoon shops would take advantage of the autumn cocoon market to acquire unpaid cocoons at high prices, harming farmers, specially requested the county government to issue a strict prohibition.</p>

His wife, Mrs. Jiang, went to the Tianbao Silver Shop on Yuanmen Bridge around 8 PM the previous day to retrieve a jade pearl and gold hairpin that she had repaired, as well as a pair of gold-wrapped hairpin heads. However, as soon as she arrived home, a thug suddenly ambushed her, knocked her down, and searched her body, taking the repaired gold jewelry, two silver dollars, three one-yuan bills, and three jiao bills. He then fled towards Zhenjun Lane. After returning home, Mrs. Jiang immediately reported the incident to the county government. County Magistrate Shan ordered the Public Security Bureau to send a team to pursue the thief, but he had already disappeared.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>The article "Pear Peel Causes Trouble, Police Officer Injured" in your Jiading local news section on September 11th does not conform to the facts. According to a report from the Zhouqiao patrol station chief, Hu Jun, on the 9th of this month, at 5:20 PM on this day, police officer Chen Yangjie saw an employee of the Yichang Water Store throwing pear cores on the street, which was detrimental to hygiene. He ordered the employee to pick them up. Zhu Fuquan, an employee of Yichangyong, refused to comply and cursed the police officer on the spot. After the police officer warned him, Zhu Fuquan gathered several dozen of his fellow employees and neighbors and shouted, "Beat him!" They dragged the police officer into the store, tied him up, beat him, tore his uniform, and left him covered in injuries. He requested immediate rescue. In order to avoid escalating the situation, the bureau immediately dispatched patrol officers Zhuo Dengwen, Liu Debiao, and Huang Xiwang to investigate and resolve the matter and maintain order. It was later reported that the police officers who arrived at the scene were also beaten and injured and returned to the bureau in a disheveled state, requesting an examination. At the same time, similar incidents occurred in the southwest parts of the city, causing disorder and unrest. Fortunately, the county government dispatched a security team to suppress the situation and strengthened the city's defenses, quickly restoring the original state. The injured police officers and the destroyed documents have been sent to the county government for investigation and handling. The article published in your newspaper is likely based on inaccurate rumors. We are sending this letter to request a correction and express our gratitude.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Jiading County Public Security Bureau</p>

<h3 id="e76">Economic Commission is Studying Implementation Methods: Kong Xiangxi Returns to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday, Denies Sending Personnel to Japan to Welcome Ross <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, recently went to Beijing to attend the standing meeting of the National Economic Commission, which has already been publicly announced. On the night before last, at 11 PM, he and Deputy Finance Minister Xu Kan took a night train from Beijing to Shanghai. They arrived at the North Station at 7:15 AM yesterday morning and went directly to their private residence on Avenue Alexandre VII to rest. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to work and met with Song Ziliang, manager of the National Goods Bank, and Tang An, superintendent of the Jianghai Customs. He then met with reporters from various newspapers and answered the following questions: (1) The report in Hong Kong that Tang An, superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, would be sent south again is incorrect. As for my trip south, I have had this intention for some time, but it will depend on whether I have time off from official duties. (2) The National Economic Commission standing committee discussed the plan to address both the symptoms and the root causes of river floods yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday). The implementation methods are currently being studied and will be handled by the competent authorities. (3) Sir Arthur Salter, the British financial expert, was sent by his country as a consultant to the embassy to investigate China's economic situation. If he negotiates with our authorities after arriving in China, he will naturally be received. The report that I specially sent Qiao Fusan and Li Rongting as representatives to Japan to welcome him is a misunderstanding. Qiao and Li studied in Japan in previous years. Qiao is now the secretary of the audit committee of the Central Mint, and he is going to Osaka to visit the local mint. Li is an employee of the Currency System Committee and is traveling with Qiao. They are not representatives sent by me to welcome Salter but are traveling for personal reasons and investigating the economic and currency system.</p>

Mr. Hu and others are not only dedicated to the cause of overseas Chinese, but also do their best to support education, culture, social welfare, and construction in the motherland, which has long been admired by the Chinese people. Dozens of groups, including the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, local associations, and the Aviation Association, have initiated a welcome. The significance is twofold: to welcome the leaders of overseas Chinese and admire their enthusiasm for supporting the motherland, and to welcome overseas Chinese athletes and encourage the courage of overseas Chinese youth.

<h3 id="e83">Commercial Organizations in Jiangsu Province Seek to Revive Native Cloth Industry, Petition to Establish a Department to Find Ways to Provide Relief, Loan Funds to Farmers to Purchase Looms <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Commercial organizations throughout Jiangsu Province, in view of the increasing decline of the native cloth industry in recent years, and fearing that the future is extremely dangerous if no measures are taken to provide relief, specially resolved by commercial organizations throughout the province to petition the Construction Department for relief. The original petition is as follows: "The reason for the decline of industry and commerce in our country is that the only problem lies in the lack of a sound regulatory policy, which has caused a tragic decline whenever superior foreign goods are encountered. Think about how in recent years, people in and out of the government in our country have been advocating domestic goods, and it can be said that their efforts have been exhausted, but the result is only a large number of inferior goods flooding the market. With foreign goods flooding in, the Chinese people should set up factories to stop the leaks, but the result is the opposite. They only see the path of following the trend, neglecting the important task of promoting domestic goods and blocking leaks, and will inevitably be eliminated. In order to prevent domestic goods from undercutting each other in the market, which has led to the decline of domestic goods, it is necessary to implement regulation without delay. Since the dumping of foreign goods, native cloth has gradually disappeared, and factories using power looms have risen at the right time, so that factory cloth is no less than a substitute for native cloth, and foreign goods are given a great opportunity. The failure of the silk industry is beyond salvation, and there are no less than hundreds of thousands of farmers who rely on this weaving sideline for their livelihood. The annual output of woven cloth by the industry associations is more than 1.5 million pieces, which is equivalent to more than 10 million yuan in national currency. It is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In the face of tight finances, material difficulties, and precarious operations, in addition to the thorough ban on night work to save the current crisis, looking ahead, there is no optimism. After joint discussions, it was unanimously agreed that only by carrying out regulatory methods can the crisis be saved. It is clear that without thoroughness, a good plan cannot be realized. The only way is to request the government to formulate the general outline of the regulatory system as soon as possible, order the various industries to formulate detailed rules, and submit them for approval, and supervise their implementation within a time limit, so that the country's future can be revitalized. As for artificial weaving, it has been affected by the intrusion of foreign goods over the years, and has been reduced year by year. Recently, although hand-pulled wooden looms have been used to widen and lengthen the front, the number of pieces woven each day is not large. In order to restore farmers' sideline occupations, it is planned to use foot-operated iron looms to increase patterns and increase production. However, farmers are limited by economic power to buy iron and wood looms, which cost about 50 yuan each, and it is difficult to prepare them. It is proposed to develop assistance measures, that is, to ask your department to consult with the Provincial Farmers' Bank, and order the branches in each county to loan 50,000 yuan in national currency to the cooperative societies and rural offices in the cloth-producing areas to be loaned to farmers, with a limit of 50 yuan per household, for the purchase of looms, or the Farmers' Bank will purchase 1,000 iron and wood looms, which will be transferred to farmers by cooperative societies and rural offices in the cloth-producing areas, one loom per household, and 10 yuan will be repaid each year, and the loan will be paid off in five years. Farmers will benefit from the assistance, and the output can be viewed. In the future, the surplus from wages can be used to purchase more looms year by year, and neighboring farmers can also follow suit. In this way, on the one hand, the rural sideline occupations can be revived, and on the other hand, the livelihood of farmers can be enriched and the skills of our country's native cloth weaving can be transformed, and the intrusion of foreign goods can be resisted invisibly and the huge leaks can be stopped."</p>

<h3 id="e86">Yi Li General Company Operated by Xu Yanzuo Ceased Operations Yesterday, Public Soda Water, Glass, Shipping, and Hardware Businesses Entrusted to Lawyers and Accountants for Liquidation <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that Yi Li General Company at 33 Tianjin Road, affected by the closure of Sanmen Bay Real Estate and Mei Feng Bank, suffered from financial difficulties and was unable to maintain operations. Yesterday, the general company and its affiliated soda factory, glass factory, shipping company, hardware store, real estate company, and bank all ceased operations at the same time and entrusted accountant Jiang Xinzhao and others to liquidate. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Businesses Operated by Xu Tingzuo</p>
<p>Yi Li General Company was founded by Xu Tingzuo from Dinghai as a sole proprietorship with a total capital of more than 1 million yuan in national currency. The businesses include Yi Li Soda Factory (address: 1568 Huade Road), Yi Li Hardware Store (address: 74 Broadway), Yi Li Shipping Company (address: 33 Tianjin Road), Yi Li Glass Factory (address: 1568 Huade Road), Zhen Li Bank (address: 170 Broadway), and Sanmen Bay Real Estate Company. It has its own Yi Li and Yi Tai ships that operate on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line and also acts as an agent for Yi Sun Shipping Company's Yi Sun ship. Business has been quite prosperous and the reputation is excellent. Xu Tingzuo serves as the general manager, and Xu Wengui, He Jinyun, Qin Rongquan, and others serve as managers of various factories and stores.</p>
<p>Failure to Reclaim Sanmen Bay</p>
<p>Xu Tingzuo aspired to reclaim Sanmen Bay, hoping to develop it into a commercial port. He invested 300,000 to 400,000 yuan successively to purchase beach land and invited people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit Sanmen Bay. At the same time, the Yi Li ship was also used to transport to Sanmen Bay for the purpose of developing Sanmen Bay. Unfortunately, since the Northeast Incident and the Shanghai War broke out one after another, the political situation was unstable and the government had no time to pay attention to this. At the same time, no one in the society responded, resulting in all the investment being stranded, consuming more than 400,000 yuan for land prices. This is what Xu feels most painful about.</p>
<p>Excessive Losses and Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>The shipping division, namely Yi Li Shipping Company's Yi Li ship, has a total tonnage of 1,055 tons and a net tonnage of 618 tons. The Yi Sun ship, which is an agency, has a total tonnage of 1,833 tons and a net tonnage of 1,068 tons. Since the opening of the route, business has been sluggish and losses have reached more than 200,000 yuan. In addition to the failure to develop Sanmen Bay, the vitality has been greatly damaged and finances have become tight. At the same time, the entire industrial and commercial atmosphere in Shanghai has reached its extreme. The banking industry has tightened loans of all kinds. The company tried its best to reorganize in order to survive.</p>
<p>Unable to Maintain Operations and Forced to Close</p>
<p>Since the closure of American Mei Feng Bank for liquidation, Yi Li General Company had overdraft transactions and owed more than 400,000 yuan. Interest was paid on time and there was no problem. Since the closure of the bank, the principal of the above overdraft, although not yet due, was urgently recovered. Although the company's assets were more than enough to compensate, the capital had been converted into real estate, factory buildings, machinery, and inventory. No one could take over at one time, and the receivables could not be recovered urgently, resulting in huge amounts of cash that could not be raised. Depositors rushed to withdraw funds, resulting in the inability to maintain operations, and the general company and its affiliated factories and stores had to be closed for liquidation.</p>
<p>Entrusted to Lawyers to Announce Liquidation</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the entrance of the general company, lawyers He Baiqian and accountant Jiang Xinzhao, representing the company, announced, "It is now reported by the person in charge of Yi Li Company that Yi Li Soda Factory, Yi Li Glass Factory, Yi Li Yi Sun Shipping Bureau, and Yi Li Hardware Store are affected by the market and cannot maintain operations due to financial difficulties. We have been entrusted to represent the liquidation. Therefore, we hereby announce on behalf of the company that all creditors are requested to bring their vouchers within 14 days to register at the liquidation office for verification. All debtors are also requested to send the owed funds to the liquidation office within the above-mentioned period to obtain receipts. If the deadline is exceeded, legal action will be taken. This is hereby notified. Liquidation Office: 170 Broadway.</p>
<p>Xu's Attitude is Very Negative</p>
<p>Xu Tingzuo is from Dinghai, Zhejiang, and is 54 years old. In view of the influx of foreign goods and the outflow of rights and interests, he has worked hard to establish industries to stop the leaks. In 1927, he founded Yi Li Soda Factory as a sole proprietorship, producing various sodas and orange juice. The sales are very wide and comparable to imported products. He purchased ships such as Yi Li to operate on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Hong Kong-Guangzhou lines. He set up a hardware store to promote canned food and jointly formed Zhen Li Bank with Deng Zhenquan. He usually has no hobbies and takes starting a business as a pastime. He is praised by the people of Shanghai and is a member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Committee for the Promotion of Domestic Goods. This sudden setback is unfulfilled and is extremely negative. It is reported that he is still staying in Shanghai, but he is refusing visitors.</p>
<p>Setting Up a Liquidation Office to Handle Registration</p>
<p>The Yi Li Soda Factory, Yi Li Hardware Store, Yi Li Shipping Company, Yi Li Glass Factory, Zhen Li Bank, and Sanmen Bay Real Estate Company, which are affiliated with the general company, have all closed down. Ships such as Yi Li have stopped sailing and are anchored on the Huangpu River in Gaochangmiao. The seafarers, factory workers, and store employees, totaling about several thousand people, have all become unemployed. The lawyers and accountants who are now handling the liquidation have set up a liquidation office at 170 Broadway to handle registration.</p>
<p>Assets and Liabilities are Very Close</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Xin Sheng She reporter learned from accountant Jiang Xinzhao that the total assets of Yi Li Company, such as real estate, factory buildings, machinery, inventory, and receivables, together with the two ships Yi Li and Yi Sun, are worth about 1.1 million yuan. The total amount of liabilities is estimated to be more than 2.3 million yuan, most of which are Mei Feng and other current accounts, a small number are consignment transactions, and individual deposits from relatives and friends. After offsetting each other, the difference is about 200,000 yuan. Except for most of the debts being secured by ships and factory buildings, the value of the collateral is also surplus. Therefore, the actual difference is negligible.</p>
<p>Decided to Discuss Reopening Methods</p>
<p>Xu's operation of various businesses was affected by the depression in the market and was unfortunately unable to turn around and was forced to close down. It is reported that after the accounts are cleared and settled, a meeting of creditors will be convened to discuss everything and then prepare to resume operations in order to fulfill the original intention of striving to start an industry.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to Order the Customs to Return the Jade Rough, The Paid Fines Were Detained Again, and Repeated Appeals Have Not Been Approved <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce reported that Chen Kaiqing, a Yunnan merchant, transported jade rough to Shanghai and was penalized by the customs for underreporting the price. After paying the full amount, the goods were detained again by the customs. Four months have passed, and the Chamber has repeatedly telegraphed the Customs Administration and the Ministry of Finance, but has not received approval. It is hereby telegraphed again to request a prompt return. The repeated telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Customs Administration</p>
<p>To the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, the merchant Chen Kaiqing transported jade rough from Myanmar to Shanghai on April 21. He declared the goods according to the original price, but the customs considered the declared price to be lower than the assessed price. In addition to paying taxes according to the assessed price, he was also fined three times. He paid the full amount on April 29 and took the goods back. While he was working on the stones, the customs took the goods away and detained them on May 22, saying that someone reported that the value of the item was quite large and needed to be investigated and dealt with. Otherwise, a guarantee must be paid in advance before it can be returned. The merchant has repeatedly stated to the customs that the business has been assessed for tax and the penalty has been completed, and there should be no further complications. Please order the customs to return the original item. He has also asked to forward the telegram here. It is found that for goods with assessed prices and taxes, the merchant who considers the assessment to be too high can raise objections within a certain period. As for the customs, since the law gives it the power to assess prices, it should be prudent in advance. According to the current regulations, the customs does not seem to have the right to raise objections to the tax that has been assessed and paid. Let's take a step back, even if such a disposal is necessary, a considerable period should be stipulated, and the expiration date should be determined. In this case, the merchant has already paid the tax according to the assessment and paid the fine. The execution has been completed and the case has been closed. In terms of judicial events, even if the prosecutor believes that the court's punishment is too light, he must file an appeal within the appeal period. There is no reason to overturn the case at any time after the execution has been completed. According to the previous situation, after paying the tax and the penalty, the merchant still cannot process, manufacture, sell, or transport the goods, and may be subject to re-evaluation and detention at any time. The right is always in an uncertain state. In terms of law and reason, there is no such method. Please quickly telegraph the Shanghai Customs, so as not to make unfounded demands on this closed case, and return the goods to Chen Kaiqing for collection as soon as possible. I pray, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce (sent on July 17) (2) To the Ministry of Finance of Nanjing, the Customs Administration, in the case of Chen Kaiqing's jade rough, the merchant submitted a report to your office in May, and the Chamber of Commerce telegraphed it again, but has not received a reply. It is a matter of course to pay taxes according to the assessed price, and the goods that have been penalized have been detained for several months without being released, which makes merchants and people have no guarantee. The Commissioner of Customs replied to the merchant that the case has been handled by the Customs Administration, and that the power to dispose of this matter fairly lies with your office. I hope you will check the telegraph and deal with it quickly to alleviate the burden on the merchants. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce (sent on July 31)</p>
<p>Report to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Report for the matter of requesting. According to Yunnan merchant Chen Kaiqing, on April 21, jade rough was transported from Myanmar to Shanghai for sale. He declared the goods according to the original price, but the customs considered the declared price to be lower than the assessed price. In addition to paying taxes according to the assessed price, he was also fined three times. He paid the full amount on April 29 and took the goods back. On May 22, the customs took the goods away and detained them, saying that someone reported that the value of the item was quite large and needed to be investigated and dealt with. Otherwise, a guarantee must be paid in advance before it can be returned. The merchant has repeatedly stated to the customs that the business has been assessed for tax and the penalty has been completed, and there should be no further complications. Please order the return of the original item. The merchant also submitted a report to the Customs Administration, but did not receive approval. Please provide assistance. The Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Customs Administration on July 17, stating that if the merchant considers the tax too high, he can raise objections within a certain period. If the customs has been given full power to assess prices by law, it should be prudent in advance and should not pick on things after the fact. Moreover, in this case, the merchant has paid the tax according to the assessed price and paid the fine. The execution has been completed, and the merchant has the full right to process, manufacture, sell, and transport the goods. If it is re-evaluated and detained at any time, the right is always in an uncertain state. According to laws and reason, there is no such method. Please correct the Shanghai Customs quickly. It has been a long time since I have received a reply. The Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Customs Administration on July 31, requesting a quick handling, but it is still being shelved. As such, the merchant's business has been suspended for a long time, which is not only a loss, but also no different from a double penalty for one case, which has never happened before. I have prepared a document to submit to your department, hoping that you will examine it and order the Customs Administration to order the Shanghai Customs to return the detained goods to the merchant for collection, so as to conform to the principles of fairness. I am sincerely grateful. (Sent on August 17)</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, the case of Chen Kaiqing's jade rough has been assessed for tax and the penalty has been completed by the customs, but it has been detained for several months due to other complications. The customs has not taken any reasonable measures. I had to telegraph the Customs Administration on July 30, and on August 10, I submitted another report to your department. It has been more than a month, but I have not received an order to return the goods. It has never happened before that a case that has been determined and closed has been dragged on for so long. I respectfully request that you order the release as soon as possible. Thank you very much. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce (sent on September 11)</p>

Now, Dat Da Steamer Company has saved silver dollars from the Mid-Autumn Festival feast and sent them to the association for disaster relief.

<p>Since the Standing Committee of the Central Committee formulated the regulations on the production and use of party and national flags and the management methods for shops selling party and national flags, and handed them over to the Central Propaganda Committee and the Ministry of Interior for joint publication and announcement to solicit merchants to undertake production, it has sent specialists to Shanghai to investigate the organization, machinery, and equipment of the shops that have applied to undertake production. It was found that the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company and the Huaxin Printing and Dyeing Factory have complete machinery and are considered qualified. The responsible representatives of the two factories, Zhang Zilian, Chi Tingxian, Jiang Linshu, and Chen Zhibi, were summoned to Beijing the day before yesterday to attend a meeting in the Central Party Headquarters conference hall. It is heard that the representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday and stated that the government has carefully considered the matter of producing and selling party and national flags, and believes that assigning only one factory to specialize in production would be too restrictive. Therefore, the meeting decided that the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company and the China Flag Manufacturing Company should jointly undertake production and sales. The two companies will each nominate an equal number of committee members to organize a production and sales headquarters to manage it. To facilitate supervision and guidance, the Central Propaganda Committee and the Ministry of Interior will each send specialists to the production and sales headquarters to implement supervision. It is also known that the two companies are actively preparing to proceed.</p>

The chairman reported briefly that in order to broadly collect aviation donations, the association is organizing the collection of donations from dance halls throughout the city. It officially started on the 15th of this month and has received enthusiastic assistance from the gentlemen of the dance halls and enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, achieving good results, which shows the enthusiasm of the general public in supporting the micro-tomb movement. Today, we have invited you to discuss all ongoing matters, because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching and the dance halls are busy with settlement, and the Wednesday tea dance party is open early, so it is a pity that not everyone is able to attend. The recent collection situation shows very good results. In order to further the plan, it is proposed to change the method, and it is hoped that you will contribute ideas for reference and research. Subsequently, representatives of the Lao Da Hua Dance Hall, Li Wei, Guo Yaozong, and others successively expressed their opinions and put forward many proposals. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e100">New Jiangtian Ferryboat Workers Submit New Life Training Opinions; Yesterday Jointly Submitted to China Merchants Bureau for Adoption <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The New Jiangtian ferryboat of the state-run China Merchants Bureau recently received an order from the Nanchang New Life Movement General Association to hold a New Life Training Class for tea-room staff, and 120 people were selected to go ashore first to start training. The tea-room staff remaining on the boat jointly submitted their opinions to the China Merchants Bureau, requesting their adoption. The original text reads, "Your Majesty, in order to contribute opinions, we sincerely request that you adopt and implement the matter. We, the entire staff of the boat, have been serving passengers for more than 20 years. In the past, for all kinds of facilities that benefit the business of the Bureau or the successive managers of the boat, we did not dare to express any opposition even if we suffered great harm. That is, the General Manager resolutely reorganized the boat this time, first re-registering, taking photos and inspecting, examining the physique, seeking guarantees, filling in voluntary books, etc., all followed orders. Unexpectedly, soon after, the boat staff were ordered to draw lots and transfer 120 people ashore to receive New Life training. The staff recognized that the General Manager's plan was profound, and after receiving the order, they worried that the boat staff were too old to undergo military training, and that the blind, weak, and old tea servants could not pass the training in a short period of time in other literacy, writing letters, and dialect classes. Therefore, without waiting for the lottery, they automatically agreed to first select 120 older people and secretly submit the list to listen to the training. The staff's move was actually to wait for the first batch of trained graduates to return to the boat and then request the General Manager to implement the small teacher system, training the first batch of trained and qualified people to train the remaining 140 people on the boat. This will not only make it easier for the staff to receive popular education, but also reduce the burden on the Bureau. I think the General Manager has the mission of reorganizing the business development of the China Merchants Bureau's ships. The above-mentioned idea of achieving two goals with one move should be adopted. Furthermore, according to the current situation of our China Merchants Bureau, if the tea servants of all the ships under its jurisdiction are given wages by the Bureau, as in the case of this boat, to win the hearts of passengers and expand business development, in the opinion of the staff, it is not a good strategy. This is because the shipping routes to various places are not exclusively for the Bureau's passengers to travel back and forth, and it is not necessarily because the staff of the Bureau's ships do not charge for wine that they can increase the number of passengers. Then, the passengers who increase on our boat must be greedy for cheap prices. If other companies therefore feel that the reduction in passengers affects their business, they will also rise up and imitate to resist. If they send more gifts and implement individual cheap and expensive prices to compete for business, we will not only lack benefits to gain, but the result will inevitably be a lose-lose situation. The staff, having learned from this, has presented the above-mentioned views for the future of the Bureau's business, and proposes to uniformly follow the order to extract wine money from the tea rooms of all ships, which can reduce the burden of more than 600,000 yuan and avoid resentment from other ships. Whether it is appropriate, we have prepared a document to request your approval and implementation, in the spirit of public service. Respectfully presented to General Manager Liu of the China Merchants Bureau, respectfully presented by all the staff of the New Jiangtian ferryboat."</p>

<p>Cao Rongqing (60 years old), a native of Chuansha, opened the Cao Shunxing bamboo shop in Miezhu Street, Nanshi, offering all kinds of bamboo utensils. Since its opening, it has been more than 30 years, and the business has been doing well. However, the shop has never had any workers. The source of its bamboo products has always been from Suzhou and other places, where boats are hired to load them into Shanghai for sale to customers. At around 7 AM, a certain Jia, carrying twelve large coal baskets, came to the Cao Shunxing shop to sell them. Cao Rongqing came out to negotiate, offering three jiao per basket, for a total of three yuan and six jiao. After the deal was made, Jia left with the money. After Cao Rongqing bought the baskets, Lao Yu, who runs the Yu Yongxing bamboo shop in Chenjia Bridge, Nanshi, suddenly arrived at Cao's shop and claimed that he wanted to buy the twelve large coal baskets. Cao Rongqing pointed out the large coal baskets he had just bought and asked him to inspect them. They agreed on a price of six jiao per basket. Lao Yu asked Cao to deliver the goods to the Chenjia Bridge shop to collect the money. Cao did not suspect anything and happily hired a cart to load the coal baskets and escorted them there. Unexpectedly, when passing the Chenjia Bridge Police Station, Lao Yu reported to the guard, pointing out that the coal baskets were stolen goods that he had lost and claiming that thefts had been frequent among the same trade recently, requesting a thorough investigation. The station detained Cao Rongqing and the coal baskets and sent them to the Ximen Branch Bureau. Cao Rongqing's son, Cao Gentao, claimed that the coal baskets had been brought by Jia, who had been introduced by Xia Jusheng, the owner of the Yiji bamboo shop at the intersection of Shachang Street, Miezhu Street, stating that they were goods from a closed shop and should be sold for cash. Since the dispute had arisen, Xia Jusheng could not stay out of it. He immediately negotiated with Xia Xuesheng and went to the police station to collect evidence and file a loss report, requesting a thorough investigation. Unexpectedly, Cao Rongqing suddenly fell ill in custody. His condition was very serious. With the approval of Chief Li, he was sent to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The rest of the matter was reported to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Cao Rongqing's illness was said to be a stroke, and there was no way to save him. He died in the hospital at 9:10 PM that night. The local headman, Gu Juyuan, reported the death to the local court yesterday, requesting an autopsy. Subsequently, Cao Rongqing's son, Cao Gentao, submitted a petition to the court requesting exemption from the autopsy and offering to arrange the coffin and burial himself. He was instructed to wait for further instructions.</p>

<p>Many properties on Nanjing Road belong to the Hardoon Foreign Firm. Due to the economic downturn, tenants have been requesting rent reductions, leading to disputes. The letter jointly sent by Sanyi and others to the Hardoon Foreign Firm, and the letter from the Nanjing Road Citizens' First District Branch to various public organizations are recorded below: (1) The letter jointly sent by Sanyi Silk Shop and others to the Hardoon Foreign Firm stated, "We are writing to inform you that due to the economic downturn and poor business, we have jointly requested that your firm reduce the rent to promote prosperity and fairness. However, your firm adheres to its opinions or insists on the lease and refuses to compromise. We have no choice but to temporarily withhold rent payments and wait for your firm to reconsider. Unexpectedly, your firm has not taken the proper route to seek a solution and instead resorts to cunning or threats. Recently, your firm sent people to collect rent from our stores, gathering crowds to force payment, arbitrarily harassing us, and disrupting our business. This is beyond excessive and not a proper approach. We believe that your firm's oppressive actions will not only easily lead to conflicts between the two parties but also cause losses to our business. If any responsibility arises, we must ask your firm to bear it." (2) The letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association stated, "(Details omitted). Our association, based on the requests of member stores on this road, has been working hard on the rent reduction movement and has repeatedly written to you for support. We are grateful for your agreement to support us. Since the beginning of the movement, it has been relatively smooth. Most landlords, both Chinese and foreign, are well aware of the difficulties faced by the stores and have agreed to reduce rents accordingly. However, the twenty or so tenants belonging to the Hardoon Foreign Firm have been peacefully requesting rent reductions based on the proportion of new rents charged to others. The foreign firm has been consistently evasive and has made insulting and unreasonable remarks. The tenants have had no choice but to temporarily suspend rent payments. Unexpectedly, the foreign firm not only refuses to reflect but also uses threats and oppression. In the past two days, they have sent seven or eight to more than ten strong men, along with shikari, to occupy the premises of Tongfu Silk Shop, Guanxin Hat Company, Dadong Socks Factory, and other stores, causing arbitrary harassment and making it impossible for these stores to operate. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, they sent more than ten people in several cars, as if facing a formidable enemy, to Sanyi Silk Shop, blocking the entrance, obstructing customers, occupying the tables, shouting abuse, causing the store to be in a state of chaos and unable to operate. Pedestrians on the road stopped to watch, causing traffic congestion and arousing public anger, almost leading to violence. The store had no choice but to close the iron gate, and the ten or so strong men left with a roar. All the stores on the road were furious upon hearing the news and anticipated that the foreign firm's oppressive tactics would be applied to each store one by one and would be endless. If not stopped, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, they have requested assistance from our association. In addition to writing to the Public Works Department to order them to stop the oppressive acts and convening an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures, we are writing to request that your association approve the transfer of a letter to the Public Works Department to protect the safety of taxpayers, protect businesses at all times, and stop the foreign firm's excessive actions to stabilize people's hearts and maintain the commercial market." The letters to the Citizens' General Assembly Rent Reduction Committee and various public organizations had similar content.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Sales of the 15th Aviation Lottery Have Exceeded Half <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Government's aviation and highway construction lottery changed to the new method, winning prizes has become more common than before. For example, after the drawing of the 13th and 14th issues, all the top four major prizes were sold out, and each had a confirmed winner. In particular, Shanghai produced many wealthy people, and wonderful stories circulated, causing a sensation in the neighborhoods. Due to space limitations, they cannot all be recorded. The old Daliyuan lottery shop in the old North Gate, a very small ticket shop, sold the first prize of the 14th issue in divided strips, showing that opportunities and coincidences are indiscriminate. The impartiality of the lottery itself is proven by strong evidence. Therefore, lottery sales are increasing with each issue. On the day of the drawing, there are almost no tickets available for purchase. A small number of remaining tickets are often sold for two or three yuan more per ticket and are sold out in an instant. The enthusiasm of the buyers is evident. It is reported that sales of the 15th issue lottery have exceeded half within a week of its issuance, a remarkable achievement rarely seen before.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Water Cutoff Dispute Involving Fuyuan Lane on Kang Nai Tuo Road Leads to Lawsuit; Both Sides Have Reasons; Defendant Also Files Counterclaim <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The houses in the Fuyuan Lane area on Kang Nai Tuo Road in West Shanghai are owned by Miao Shaoxian, a native of Yong, who is the issuing agent for the Hongda Lace Shop on Jingyuan Street, Mantingfang, Guangdong Road. Fuyuan Ji Property Management was established to rent the houses to Zhu Jinfu and others, with a monthly rent of 46 yuan per building, including water fees. Recently, Zhu and others, noting the poor economic conditions and slow business, as well as the high market prices and large expenses, jointly wrote to the landlord, requesting consideration of the business difficulties and a reduction in rent. They received a reply stating that if all tenants could pay off their back rent, the monthly rent would be reduced by 5 yuan and the water fee by 3 yuan. However, the water users would have to install their own water meters and pay directly. After calculating, Zhu and others concluded that this method was no different from not reducing the rent at all. They wrote back to the landlord, declaring the cancellation of the original agreement to reduce the rent and agreeing to pay the original rent. Unexpectedly, around 10:00 AM on the 15th of last month, the water supply in the area was suddenly cut off. Repeated negotiations were unsuccessful. Zhu and others, believing that the interruption of drinking water was a major threat to life, consulted lawyer Huang Xiubo, along with residents Chen Rongqing, Zhu Huirong, Yu Qingjiang, Lin Xinfu, and others, a total of fifteen households, and accused Miao Shaoxian of endangering public safety at the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan of the Eighth Criminal Court summoned the defendant, Miao Shaoxian. Miao Shaoxian was unable to attend due to business in Yong, and lawyer Xi Yaoxi appeared in court to submit a defense and file a counterclaim, stating that because of the economic downturn, the original plaintiff, Miao Shaoxian, had voluntarily reduced the rent for the Fuyuan Lane houses under management. On June 23rd of this year, he sent separate letters to each counter-defendant, detailing the rent reduction plan and stating that due to high water fees, in order to safeguard the interests of both parties, starting from August 1st, in addition to voluntarily subsidizing each tenant with 3 yuan per month for water fees and paying the water meter deposit, the Shanghai Waterworks Company was instructed to install water meters for each household. He also instructed the tenants to pay the water meter deposit to the Shanghai Waterworks Company before July 21st. Unexpectedly, between August 12th and 16th, when the Shanghai Waterworks Company was updating its systems, the counter-defendants suddenly sent letters to the Fourth District Citizens' Association, requesting the restoration of the old system. The original plaintiff replied, explaining that the water meter deposit had already been paid, and all matters had been settled and could not be restored. Therefore, the water cutoff was actually due to the counter-defendants' failure to pay the water meter deposit on time, resulting in the cutoff by the Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the original plaintiff not only had no right to interfere but was now being accused of making false accusations. Judge Wu inquired and found that the original plaintiffs had mostly appointed representatives to the court today, and since the defendant had filed a counterclaim, the original plaintiffs were also counter-defendants and could not send representatives to the case. Therefore, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for hearing and that both parties must personally appear in court next time for questioning.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 4th of this month, detectives Wang Zhihao and Zhang Bingkun of the French Concession Police were patrolling the Jixiang Street area when they noticed a man named Sun Yuanqing acting suspiciously. They approached him for questioning, but he gave evasive answers. They searched him and found more than ten obscene photographs on his person. They took him to the police station, where Sun confessed that he lived at No. 212 Anren Street in the city, inside the Qinglian Painting Mounting Shop, and admitted that the boss, surnamed Gao, who sold these photographs, lived at No. 63 Bair Road. Based on the confession, the detectives immediately went to No. 63 Bair Road to arrest Gao, but he had already fled. A large number of obscene photographs, glass negatives, and printing equipment were confiscated at Gao's residence and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Gao is still at large and has not been apprehended. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Sun Penghan of the Second Special District Court convened a trial at the Eighth Criminal Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the Police Department presented the case, indicting him for the crime of obstructing public morals under Article 235 of the Criminal Code. Detective Wang Zhihao, who handled the case, reported on the investigation process and presented the evidence. Sun Yuanqing denied selling the photographs, claiming that the photographs found on his person were bought from Gao for viewing. After reviewing the evidence, the court ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and scheduled the sentencing for the 19th.</p>

The body was sent to the Tongren Auxiliary Hall morgue for examination. The next day, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court arrived to conduct an examination. The body was claimed by the deceased's brother, Zhang Geping. Details have been previously reported in this newspaper. It is learned that the deceased's family members believe that the school's swing set equipment was inadequate, leading to the tragedy.

<p>Rickshaw drivers in the area south and west of Shanghai (i.e., the "Little Agreement") previously announced a strike on the morning of the 6th of last month in protest of the French Public Works Department's notice to register rickshaw drivers. They appointed representatives, carrying banners, to petition various Party and government agencies. A portion of them planned to petition the French Police Department and the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association. At around 9:00 AM that morning, they arrived at the intersection of Xujiahui Road, the boundary between the Chinese and French areas at Xieqiao. A conflict broke out when a Vietnamese policeman stationed there by the French Police Department prevented them from passing. The crowd was agitated, resulting in three Vietnamese policemen being assaulted and injured, and a pistol and rifle being snatched. The French Police Department dispatched a large number of detectives and patrol cars to suppress the crowd, disperse them, and arrest the perpetrators, Xue Ruji, Li Yuehua, and Xu Xiaosi. They recovered broken firearms, damaged hats, iron bars, stones, and banners used in the assault. They took Xue and the other two to the Second Special District Court, where they were prosecuted for disturbing public order, obstructing official duties, and assault. Judge Sun Penghan conducted repeated hearings and meticulous investigations, details of which have been reported in this newspaper. The interrogation has been completed, and sentencing was scheduled. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Judge Sun presided over the sentencing at the Eighth Criminal Court. After briefly questioning the defendants' ages and origins, he announced the verdict: Xue Ruji and Xu Xiaosi were each sentenced to 50 days of detention for jointly causing bodily harm to others. Li Yuehua (same charge) was sentenced to 30 days of detention. The portion of the charges accusing them of inciting others through writing was found not guilty. During the appeal period, Li Yuehua was allowed to be released on bail with the assurance of appearing when summoned. Xue and Xu were returned to the detention center to await instructions.</p>

<p>On the 9th of this month, a young man and a young woman checked into the Beizhan Hotel at No. 43 Jielu, claiming to be named Huang Daxing, 19 years old, a local, and his wife. The hotel assigned them room No. 22. It was observed that the two were affectionate and inseparable, never leaving the hotel. It was not until around 7:00 PM on the 11th that they went out together and returned at midnight before going to sleep. Unexpectedly, around noon yesterday, the two had not yet gotten up. The tea servers, noticing that this was different from usual, knocked on the door and called out, but there was no response for a long time. Realizing that something was wrong, they broke down the door and found the man and woman lying stiffly in bed, their faces pale and unconscious. Two teacups were placed by the bed, containing a small amount of poison. They rushed out to report to the front desk, who in turn reported to the Huisi Police Station, which dispatched a vehicle to take the man and woman to the hospital for treatment. However, due to severe poisoning, their conditions were both critical. It is feared that they intended to commit suicide due to love troubles. The police are still investigating.</p>

<p>Yang Cuiying (also known as Cao Yang), a local young woman, 21 years old, married Cao Xuewen two years ago through a matchmaker. She gave birth to a daughter last October. Recently, due to differences of opinion between husband and wife, Yang Cuiying returned to her mother's home and refused to return. The other day, Yang Cuiying hired lawyer Sun Biwu to file for divorce in the District Court. The complaint stated that three months after the marriage, the defendant's behavior changed. First, he claimed that the clinic he operated was losing money and pawned most of the plaintiff's dowry items. Then, he demanded that the plaintiff borrow money from others, and if she failed to do so, he would beat and scold her. The plaintiff initially thought that he was upset due to business problems, so she swallowed her anger and patiently offered kind words of advice. However, the defendant not only did not repent but became even more excessive, treating her as an enemy, and the marital relationship was severed. The plaintiff was disheartened and hopeless about the future, and requested a divorce, detailing five points: (1) request for divorce; (2) return of the plaintiff's wages of 330 yuan; (3) if the clothing and jewelry cannot be returned in their original condition, please return 1,230 yuan; (4) living expenses of 1,000 yuan; (5) the infant born should be raised by the plaintiff. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the defendant, Cao Xuewen, yesterday through Judge Hong Zhuan, and Cao Xuewen also hired a lawyer to defend him in court. First, the plaintiff, Yang Cuiying, accompanied by lawyer Sun, filed the case and described the previous situation. When questioned, the defendant, Cao Xuewen, stated that he was 24 years old and lived in Yangjiazhai, Pudong. He graduated from the Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital and moved to Niuzhuang, but the hospital was closed because he could not maintain it. He is now unemployed at home. He admitted that there were quarrels between husband and wife but denied any instances of beating. He disagreed with the divorce and requested to be reconciled, asking her to return home and live together. The judge, after obtaining the statements, repeatedly enlightened the plaintiff, stating that quarrels between husband and wife are common in families and should not be taken to extremes. He instructed both lawyers to mediate a settlement out of court. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

It has been decided that Mr. Xiao Junshi will go to the United States, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other cities, to conduct research and promote domestic products. They also plan to establish a domestic products market in San Francisco to promote them. Mr. Xiao's passport and other procedures have been completed, and he is scheduled to depart in early next month. If domestic manufacturers want to promote their products overseas, they can take this opportunity to entrust the company to promote and sell them. It is reported that several companies have already contacted them. The future results are expected to be promising.</p>

<p>This Year's "National Bank Yearbook" Published. The compilation and publication of bank yearbooks are considered urgent tasks in advanced countries around the world. The rise and fall of the banking industry in our country has spanned forty years, but statistical data is still lacking in concrete records, making it difficult to learn from the past and predict the future. Recognizing this, the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China began editing and publishing the "National Bank Yearbook" last summer, which has attracted attention from all sectors. The Economic Research Office of the Bank of China believes that the value of the yearbook lies in its continuous annual publication, allowing readers to understand the entire context. Therefore, the work of compiling and continuing the project has been undertaken, and the second "National Bank Yearbook" has now been published. The content materials of this edition are based on the changes of the past year and seek to be newer and more comprehensive. Superfluous information has been removed, and the essence has been retained to avoid unnecessary repetition. Bank annual reports, bank essays, indexes, and information on warehouses and godowns are all newly added this year. The operating reports of major banks over the years are particularly difficult for outsiders to collect, and even if they are collected, they are not necessarily complete. The index of bank essays is especially helpful for bankers and economists. These are the greatest advantages of this publication. The entire book consists of ten chapters and six appendices, totaling hundreds of thousands of words.

<p>The Press and Domestic Cigarettes - One of the special supplements of the Chinese National Cigarette Maintenance Association Exhibition</p>
<h3 id="e139">Newspaper Opinion on National Cigarettes <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Cigarette Maintenance Association held a National Cigarette Exhibition and published a special supplement. Thanks to the generosity and valuable advice of the gentlemen of the press, much encouragement was given to the cigarette factories and the people of the country. In particular, the cigarette factories received many methods and lessons on how to promote their products. Among those we have received are Mr. Wang Boqi, manager of the Xinwen News; Mr. Ma Yinliang, manager of Shenbao; Mr. Mi Jifang, manager of the Chenbao; Mr. Wang Loubing, acting general manager of the Shishi Xinbao and the Da Wanbao, and Mr. Wang Jilu, manager of the Shibao, Mr. Chen Yaozhu, manager of the Da Wanbao, some of whom made very detailed statements and some of whom contributed very important opinions. The Association expresses its deep respect to all of them. There were still a few who were left out, either because of the urgency of time or because we failed to meet them, for which we cannot help but express our deep apologies.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Psychological Construction <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— (Ma Yinliang)</p>
<p>I recently translated an article by Mr. Arnold, a commercial attaché at the American Consulate, who instructed us on how to develop foreign trade, and whose final conclusion was "Developing domestic trade is the foundation for developing foreign trade. To get foreigners to use Chinese goods, the Chinese people must first promote them themselves."</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Shen Junyi told us after returning from Europe about the situation in which the European people are happy to use domestic goods. The cigarettes smoked by the German people are not as good in form or flavor as foreign goods, but they smoke them with pleasure.</p>
<p>I believe that in the psychology of the people of the whole country, we should know that it is the duty of the Chinese people to use Chinese goods, and it is a shame to use foreign goods, unless it is when there is no domestic goods to replace them and they are indispensable. This kind of psychological construction of love for domestic goods can save China, now and in the future.</p>
<p>My opinion on the promotion of domestic goods is this. Now, in the midst of an enthusiastic wave of promoting domestic cigarettes, I think we should start with psychological construction first, so that there is great hope for the future of promoting domestic cigarettes.</p>
<h3 id="e141">What is Expected of the Press <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Commemorating the 88th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, the gentlemen of the press each expressed their great opinions and published them in special publications. They each based their views on their individual personalities and positions to promote cigarettes. As the saying goes, "A single call from a high place will be echoed by all the mountains." This Association has nothing but deep gratitude and feels that it is unnecessary to disturb you with any further requests! However, I still have a few expectations, which I would like to express before my beloved gentlemen of the press; it is truly like family chatter, because of the depth of love, I do not realize the cost of offering words? If we can understand each other's hearts, then even if these extravagant hopes remain extravagant, it would be without regret for the press of our country!</p>
<p>It is said that the domestic cigarette industry has somewhat special circumstances compared to other domestic industries. This special circumstance is the essence of its special difficulties, and it is hoped that the press can strive to eliminate them. Let me briefly mention it.</p>
<p>People all say, "Cigarettes are a consumer good, how many people can afford it!" Or they say, "This is an exciting substance, which is harmful to public health!" Those who say this seem to forget that the money they spend can be used to buy an equivalent amount of pleasure; or that even a little excitement can be used to refresh, relieve worries, and cleanse the stomach. Only wine is unlimited, and can lead to chaos; if used extravagantly, even if the thing itself is very beneficial, it will eventually become a great harm! It is like purely entertaining novels and plays, which only contribute to regulating the mind and nourishing life. Should the world then place them in the ranks of art and popular education, or should they be criticized? However, cigarettes are used in the same way, and there is no need to criticize them. If we can establish a position and settle down, then our feelings will be balanced. Should the gentlemen of the press then disregard the words of others, uphold justice, and often spread the word, so as to correct the distorted consciousness of the masses?</p>
<p>The domestic cigarette industry has strong enemies abroad, and their power is obvious. Given our country's weakness, even dealing with them in the written word is met with much fear. At home, our compatriots have mixed attitudes, some are obsessed with foreign goods and cannot break free, while others are too lazy to think about it and are always in a state of indifference, thinking that cigarettes are a trivial matter and that it is not worth making a fuss about. Those in the cigarette industry are in a difficult position and are afraid to act rashly. Our gentlemen of the press should remember that you can see everything clearly, so please show the power of the host and the guest, clarify the distinction between benefits and harms, and point out clearly so that those with simple thoughts will not always be lost, and those with nervous minds will not be suspicious and mistaken? This Association is willing to follow behind the gentlemen of the press and shout, and will not hesitate to look back!</p>
<p>If the press has already given to this Association, and if it continues for a long time, then this help is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is not only the blessing of the Cigarette Maintenance Association, but the blessing of the entire domestic cigarette industry!</p>
<h3 id="e142">How to Maintain Domestic Cigarettes <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— (Wang Boqi)</p>
<p>I am a person who does not smoke cigarettes. Whenever I see people swallowing clouds and spitting fog from their mouths, I never know what kind of fun they have. However, no matter where or when, smokers can be seen everywhere, and it has become a common habit. The only thing it does is consume.</p>
<p>Originally, consumption should be reduced, so why must we maintain it? This is because society and people today have made smoking cigarettes an unbreakable habit in their lives, and there is absolutely no possibility of quitting. In fact, it has changed from consumption to a need. In that case, instead of smoking foreign cigarettes, it is better to think about it from a negative point of view and promote domestic goods and maintain domestic cigarettes, which can also reduce the outflow of more than 10 million yuan every year, maintain the workers of many cigarette factories, and the farmers in the tobacco-producing areas, and also increase the large income of the national treasury. The establishment of the China Domestic Cigarette Maintenance Association is to awaken the psychology of the people to love domestic goods. It has a great significance and is worthy of admiration. However, how can domestic cigarettes be maintained? According to the contribution of this layman, the people should, of course, fulfill their national responsibilities and must smoke domestic cigarettes. On the part of the cigarette merchants, they should also work hard to improve and strive for excellence in their products. The price should be commensurate with the value, and they should unite with their peers and encourage each other in order to be successful. I sincerely advocate this and look forward to the efforts of the members of the Maintenance Association.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Three Battle Lines <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— (Mi Li Fang)</p>
<p>Although cigarettes are a kind of consumable, they are indispensable for intellectuals, especially writers. Originally, China did not have cigarettes. After they flowed in from foreign countries, people generally found them convenient and slowly all started smoking them. From then on, the floodgates opened wide, and a large amount of money flowed into foreign cities every year, an uncountable sum. Seeing such a crisis, domestic cigarette factories were established one after another.</p>
<p>In fact, it is a matter of course for Chinese people to use Chinese goods, and it is also natural for Chinese people to smoke Chinese cigarettes. There is no need to explain it further. Now, to wait for domestic cigarette merchants to promote, advocate, and persuade Chinese people to smoke Chinese cigarettes is already an extremely painful thing for the domestic factories themselves. And the mentality of Chinese people not valuing domestic goods can also be seen from this.</p>
<p>Therefore, to promote and maintain domestic cigarettes, it can be discussed in the following three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Reforming the psychology of Chinese people. Generally, those who smoke foreign cigarettes do so out of a mentality of worshiping foreign goods and considering themselves wealthy. Therefore, this kind of mentality and habit should be broken first. In fact, among the current domestic cigarettes, there are also very high-quality products that are sufficient to match foreign cigarettes. Recently, I saw that a foreign-style grand hotel has also started selling domestic cigarettes, which shows that the psychology of Chinese people is gradually changing, which is also a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>(2) Improving the quality of domestic products themselves. Domestic cigarettes often become popular when they are first produced, but then gradually decline. The quality also slowly becomes inferior to the initial products. The taste of the cigarettes cannot be maintained at this standard. Therefore, domestic cigarette merchants, in order to have Chinese people smoke domestic cigarettes, should do their best to improve and progress in terms of technical and capital possibilities.</p>
<p>(3) Promoting domestic goods through publicity. Publicity is of course also the most important task. Small shops that sell cigarettes should be made aware of the importance of smoking domestic cigarettes and understand that they should do their best to promote domestic cigarettes. For the intellectual community, there should be constant promotional materials to stimulate them, such as pamphlets. Finally, it is hoped that the government authorities, within the possible range of financial resources, will give domestic cigarette merchants a reduction in taxes. There are many ways to promote, and this is only one of the important ones.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Two Purposes <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— (Wang Jilu)</p>
<p>Although cigarettes are not food, they now occupy a place among commodities and are becoming increasingly popular. People need them as much as they need rice and wheat. China initially did not have cigarettes. Since their introduction from Europe and the West, everyone has had one in their hand, and they have become popular throughout the country. Statistics show that the amount of money exported each year due to cigarette smoking is immeasurable. People with ambition have therefore started their own domestic cigarette factories to resist foreign goods. Although there are dozens of domestic cigarette factories, they produce thousands of varieties of cigarettes. However, due to domestic and foreign troubles in recent years, the country is in turmoil, rural areas are bankrupt, industry and commerce have failed, and finance is extremely tight as a result. Livelihoods are difficult. Therefore, the cigarette industry has also shown signs of decline. Leaders in the cigarette industry have therefore established the China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association, hoping to seek the revival of domestic cigarettes. This is truly a good strategy. In this critical period for domestic cigarettes, what methods should we use to revive and rise up? People have long called for "National Goods to Save the Country." Smoking domestic cigarettes means using domestic goods. Using domestic goods is the first step towards achieving the meaning of National Goods to Save the Country. Therefore, "National Goods to Save the Country" can also be called "Cigarettes to Save the Country." In the current period, we should start by saving the cigarette industry, and then we can save the country and the people. To revive domestic cigarettes, there are two purposes. One is the cigarette factory, and the other is the smoker. Cigarette factories should strive for excellence in their products and adhere to the principle of small profits. Companies in the same industry should have a spirit of competition, but they should also have a sincere heart of mutual love and protection. Do not shed blood because of commercial warfare, and do not slander each other out of jealousy. Then the future will be bright, and reviving from decline will be just around the corner. As for smokers, everyone should have a cigarette in their hand, and domestic products should be valued. While we should not have xenophobic thoughts, we cannot be without a patriotic heart. Break the vanity of worshiping foreign cigarettes and eliminate the bad habit of despising domestic cigarettes. Introduce them to everyone and do your best to promote them. Smoking to save the country is a win-win situation. Strive, cigarette factories! Work hard, smokers!</p>
<h3 id="e145">Correcting "Foreign Obsession" <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— (Chen Yaozhu)</p>
<p>I believe that the decline of China's cigarette industry has many causes, but the Chinese people's psychology of worshiping foreign goods is a major blow. Looking at middle-class and above families in our country, the cigarettes they smoke are mostly imported goods, as if they are not enough to show their high status. If this kind of psychology is not eliminated one day, domestic cigarettes will be hindered one day. Therefore, to seek the revival of domestic cigarettes, we must first correct the Chinese people's psychology of "foreign obsession" and make everyone feel honored to smoke domestic cigarettes and ashamed to buy foreign cigarettes. Then domestic cigarettes will have hope of revival.</p>
<p>As for the domestic cigarette industry itself, at this time of extreme business decline, it is especially important to redouble its efforts. The products must be excellent, and the costs must be reduced to meet the needs of the Chinese people. Although it is said that the Chinese people's psychology of worshiping foreign goods is too deep, if there are exquisite domestic goods, it is enough to change their usual perception. Is it not true of the towels we use every day? Twenty years ago, those sold in our country were all iron anchor brand from a certain country. Since the advent of the domestic triangle brand towels, the Chinese people have been happy to buy and use them because of their excellent quality and low price. The iron anchor brand then disappeared from our country. The heart of patriotism, everyone has it. If one abandons cheap and good domestic goods and does not use them, and would rather buy inferior foreign goods at a high price, unless one is insane, how could one do this? Therefore, I hope that the domestic cigarette industry will broaden its horizons, carefully study its products, and take the cause as a prerequisite, rather than be greedy for immediate profits and commit suicide. Regarding the same industry, we should also, as the Maintenance Association declared, unite with each other and consolidate the united front. It is not appropriate to seek one's own interests and be profit-seeking, giving others an opportunity to take advantage of, and causing a crisis of being defeated individually. If we proceed in this way and move forward, the revival of domestic cigarettes can be expected.</p>
<h3 id="e146">After the Visit: Additional Thoughts <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhen Chao)</p>
<p>The news community is deeply enthusiastic about promoting domestic cigarettes. This time, we visited the managers of various newspapers and received a very warm reception, with valuable opinions expressed. Among these many proposals that contribute to domestic cigarettes, let us make a small summary.</p>
<p>Taken together, these can be divided into the following three main arguments: (1) We should ask the Chinese people to first reform their psychology and cultivate the habit of loving and using domestic goods; (2) Domestic cigarette manufacturers should do their best to improve and upgrade their goods within the possible range of technology and economics; (3) In terms of promotion, we should make promoters do their best to promote domestic cigarettes.</p>
<p>These are almost unanimous arguments. We sincerely hope that the Chinese people and domestic cigarette manufacturers will encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Wishing a Victorious Future <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— (Wang Loubing)</p>
<p>When writers conceive ideas, they often hold a cigarette in their hand, inhaling and exhaling, which is enough to add to the elegant mood. However, most of these consumer goods are imported from abroad or manufactured in factories set up in China with foreign investment. Therefore, the market is filled with foreign goods. The amount of cash flowing out of the country every year is huge. If this continues without seeking relief, how can the people bear it, how can the country bear it? Gentlemen, to maintain domestic cigarettes is also a deep-hearted wish. Therefore, I am very happy to see the success of the gentlemen. I will speak slowly and wish you a smooth future.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Opening of the Jiangsu Provincial Games, Opening Ceremony, Speeches by Zhou Fo Hai, etc. Heroes of Both Sexes Fight in a Great Wind and Rain <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang) The opening of the Fourth Jiangsu Provincial Games was held at 8 a.m. on the 12th at the Provincial Stadium. More than a thousand representatives from various agencies and guests attended. Chen Guofu, the president of the General Assembly, was unable to return to the province to participate due to matters in Beijing. After the meeting, all the athletes toured the venue for a week. Zhou Fohai delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches by Yu Jingtao and Zhang Gongren. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Speech by President Zhou</p>
<p>In brief, he said, everyone, the Fourth Jiangsu Provincial Games opened today. At this opening, there are nine things I want to report to you and hope you will pay attention to. First, the reason why we decided to open today is that the weather is cool at this time, and the spirit of the athletes can be invigorated and enterprising. Who knows that the weather these days is still very hot, which is a deficiency in this conference. However, you have the spirit of hard work, healthy bodies, and strong wills. You will definitely be able to endure hardship. In the future, when we fight for our nation, the labor will be even more severe than it is now. So take this opportunity to exercise our physique. However, in this hot weather, everyone must pay special attention to diet and clothing to prevent the occurrence of diseases. This is the first point I hope everyone will pay attention to. Second, everyone should know the spirit and meaning of the Games. The meaning of the Games is not only in the technical competition, but most importantly, it is a training in social morality. How can our society progress? Because after competition, there must be victory or defeat. The winner exists, and the loser is eliminated. Everyone works hard to compete for survival, and society will naturally progress. There is also a saying that society cannot compete, and the progress of society is in mutual assistance and cooperation, because competition is tantamount to killing each other. When the two sides compete, each other's strengths are offset. The most obvious example is international war. In times of war, I do not know how many lives, forces and spirits must be sacrificed. It can gradually degrade society. Therefore, it is believed that mutual assistance and cooperation can make society progress, but we believe that the progress of society requires war, but competition must be based on proper methods. The so-called proper methods, the first is fair conditions, the second is public mode, and the second is a fair attitude. Competition under these three circumstances can promote social progress. The Games are a representative of legitimate competition. When we watch the race, everyone's starting point is the same. For example, in the competition, the number of people on both sides is equal, which is a fair condition. Everyone should perform their skills under fair conditions. When the game is in progress, there are many referees and spectators watching, and there is no opportunity to speculate and take advantage of the opportunity. This is completely an open way. Third, the attitude should be fair. The so-called fair attitude is that there are many rules during the game, and everyone must abide by those rules. If any of the athletes violate the rules, the conference will stop their attendance. Therefore, the Games can represent legitimate competition. If we promote this kind of legitimate competition to society, it will definitely make society progress. Therefore, the Games are also a driving force for social progress. This is the true meaning of the Games. Finally, what needs to be known is that since there is competition, there will certainly be victory and defeat, but we take victory and defeat too seriously, and often break the rules in our eagerness to win, and take actions outside the rules, which loses the meaning of the Games. Therefore, we do not want to win by breaking the rules, otherwise this kind of victory is a disgrace. We must seek victory in fair competition to be glorious. I hope that everyone will not pay too much attention to victory or defeat, but must pay attention to the spirit of the conference. The above three points are reported to everyone at today's opening, and I hope you will pay more attention.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Committee Member Zhang, representing the Provincial Party Department, and Director Yu, representing Chairman Chen, delivered speeches one after another.</p>

<p>The weather has been hot for days, consistently above 95 degrees. This morning (12th), the heat did not diminish, but the sky was covered with dense black and white clouds, seemingly indicating rain. At 11 a.m., right during the ball game competition, a sudden downpour occurred, and the ball game was suspended. At 12 p.m., the sky cleared, and a strong wind rose again, causing the entire venue to call out with cold. In the afternoon, the audience all wore jackets to the venue. The track and field competition began at 1:30 p.m. Except for the men's 100-meter semi-final and the shot put breaking the provincial record, there were no special achievements in any other events. There are two reasons for this: one is that the track was damp, and the other is that the northwest wind was blowing head-on, so the results were naturally affected.</p>

There were a total of seven people gathered to start. With the sound of the cannon, they chased each other side by side, intimately. Wan Jingde of the second district was far ahead. After one lap, Li Yanxiang of the eighth district took the opportunity to catch up and led the way to the finish line, winning the championship in 2 minutes and 13.4 seconds.</p>

<p>The soccer match between Districts 2 and 4 was held at 10:00 am. Referee Shen Hui chose the location. District 2 had the wind advantage and occupied a favorable position, often circling the ball within the territory of District 4. Several attacks on the goal were too hasty. After 20 minutes, Shen Shiqi, the right forward of District 2, got a long pass from Liang Guansong, sneaked past the defender of District 4, and kicked the ball into the net. Seeing that they had lost a goal, the spirits of District 4 were boosted, and they launched a counterattack. Gu Jingchu took the lead, and the two right flanks supported each other and advanced. Just as they reached the goal, they fell short. The ball lightly and urgently entered the territory of District 4 again. Defender Li was so anxious to save the ball that the ball hit his own teammate, and the ball bounced in again. The middle pile was re-contested. Before long, the first half ended like this. When they changed sides to fight again, District 4 had the upper hand, and suddenly the players became active. Cai Ruiqing ran quickly, reaching the baseline and making a cross. Gu Zhongfeng took the lead and lightly touched the net. District 2 was unwilling to be silent, and launched a counterattack. The five forwards advanced together, and the front of District 4's goal became eventful. Defender Li was unable to attend to everything, and the people in the industry lost another one. The wind and rain arrived, and the game was suspended for a while. After that, District 2 still took the offensive, sending out all their troops, and the rear defense was empty. Gu Jingchu crossed the Chencang River secretly, as if entering an uninhabited place. The goalkeeper of District 2 was isolated and helpless, and was pulled back by one, and the situation became tense again. District 4 tried their best to attack, hoping to make it a tie, but the time had come, and they were defeated by a score of three to one.</p>

<p>Most of the players from District Eight are from the Revenue Police Corps. They are tall and have been well-trained while the corps was stationed in Shanghai, with more opportunities for matches. Therefore, their strength can be considered formidable, and the championship likely belongs to them. At 10 a.m., under the whistle of referee Xu, they chose directions and began the match. Wu Qiusheng from District Three scored first, but District Eight had a free throw opportunity and scored two points, then scored two more goals, taking the lead on the scoreboard. The players from District Three lacked coordination and their shooting was inaccurate. Although Chu Daoyuan was good at long shots, he scored too few points. Due to their poor performance, District Three substituted fresh players, but by that time, they were already ten points behind. Ling Shunkun from District Two scored two points immediately, but District Eight then scored six consecutive points. Ling continued to gain a point for District Three. Ultimately, District Eight, with their height and strength, had more opportunities to get the ball, winning the first half 29 to 16. After the lemon time, District Eight scored another three points. Fu Yang from District Three came on and made a few decent shots, scoring four points. District Eight, already with a clear advantage, still did not show any weakness. Chen Jinzhong and Zhuo Guorong advanced and launched offensive, seizing cities. District Three rallied briefly, but the score difference was too great, rendering them powerless. In the second half, they failed again, 18 to 25, resulting in a total score of 54 to 34, with District Eight winning.</p>

<p>(1) The construction of the presidium stage of this association has just been completed. There are many conference members whose colored clothes are smeared with paint. They are not happy about it; instead, they frown.</p>
<p>(2) During the afternoon match, the northwest wind was strong, with flying sand and stones. The audience was blinded by it. Many of the hats worn by the Boy Scouts maintaining order on the field were blown away by the wind. The fans saw this and shouted, "Kick the ball!"</p>
<p>(3) The soccer field is located in front of the presidium stage. During the match between Districts Two and Four in the morning, District Four lost two goals due to the wind. The female guests and hostesses on the presidium stage all cried foul for District Four.</p>
<p>(4) When the various ball games reached a tense point, the merciless autumn rain poured down. Most fans, though their clothes were getting wet, could not bear to leave the field. Those who rushed to leave had nowhere to take shelter from the rain. In the end, they were all soaked. A group of modern girls in thin clothes and trousers showed embarrassed expressions.</p>

<p>The grand international swimming performance, organized by Sheng Da Zhuang, was held at the City Swimming Pool in the city center at 9 o'clock last night. More than a thousand people, including Mayor Wu, Li Dachao, and guests from all walks of life, attended. The various programs were extremely exciting and broke all the city records. The results were wonderful. Finally, Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for all the athletes, and the event ended in great joy around 11 o'clock. It is a pity that the wind was strong and cold. A reporter from the Guojue News Agency investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Weather Update</p>
<p>Last night, all the lighting equipment in the city's new pool was fully configured. Electric lights surrounded the stands like long snakes, and the wall lamps everywhere were also brightly lit. Especially the radiating lights in the pool were the most beautiful. Being in it was like being in a crystal palace. Although there was a heavy downpour last night, there were still more than a thousand spectators. At 8 o'clock sharp, the competition began. The City Police Department band played music on the field, and after each competition, Mr. Shen Siliang announced the results in Chinese and English via wireless radio.</p>
<p>Competition Situation</p>
<p>After the competition started, the first event was the 50-meter freestyle. Liang Huisheng from our country competed fiercely with Boton. As a result, he ranked second with a difference of one meter, but he had already overwhelmed Pan Qiyou, the champion of the previous Hong Kong, by half a meter. No one from our country originally joined the 200-meter freestyle. Shi Bogen played the role temporarily. As a result, Shi Bogen fell behind Pan Morda by more than 20 meters. One of the most exciting events was the 100-meter breaststroke. Jian Erjie took the lead all the way after starting, reaching 35 meters away. Even Wang Weilzi ranked second. Jian Erlian won the third place, which is also commendable. In the 100-meter freestyle, Liang Huisheng, with his long-term illness, was not ashamed to lose to Haimeng. Hai's results broke the national record. Our country did not participate in the 100-meter backstroke and women's 50-meter. The 300-meter relay was temporarily changed to 200 meters.</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>After the competition, Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet on the first floor of the new pool for all the Chinese and Western athletes from the city who participated in the Hong Kong-Shanghai swimming competition. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Section Chief Li Dachao, and Shen Siliang, Executive Director of the National Sports Association, accompanied him. During the banquet, the mayor gave a speech, saying, "I am very pleased that the grand international competition tonight has been graced by the presence of Chinese and Western athletes. I hope that this new pool can be used more in the future to improve our country's swimming technology. In this Hong Kong-Shanghai swimming competition, Shi and Jian were selected for the first time, which is a glorious page in the history of swimming in our city. Tonight, I, in the name of the mayor, have prepared a silver cup to be presented to the city's inter-city representative team, and I hope that this trip to Hong Kong can bring victory," etc. Mr. Hekesilai, Chairman of the City Amateur Swimming Association, received the mayor's large silver cup and handed it over to Haimeng, the captain of the inter-city team. They took a group photo together and dispersed in great joy around 11 o'clock. All ten members of the inter-city team will board the President Cleveland at the New Customs Wharf at 11 o'clock tonight and set sail for Hong Kong at 5 o'clock tomorrow morning, led by Hekesilai.</p>

<h3 id="e166">City Private School Teacher Training Class: Hired Lecturers to Give Lectures; Gu Yinqian and Others Hired as Lecturers; Scheduled to be Held Once Every Saturday <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The private school teacher training class organized by the City Education Bureau was previously designated in six schools in the district, including the Municipal Agricultural Field, Caotang, Tanzhen, Caonan, Yucai, and Jingcun. It opened on September 1st, and the Education Bureau appointed Ling Xianwen, Tang Jingxiu, Gao Jie, Lü Xinfu, Shen E, and Sun Shiju to participate. According to the reports of these members, the number of private school teachers in Caotang is too small, with only twelve actually attending. The number of people in Tanzhen and Yucai schools is too large, reaching more than 80 people, which is impossible to arrange. After receiving the report, the Education Bureau believes that the number of people in Caotang is too small, does not meet the regulations, and is not economical, so it should be stopped immediately, and all private school teachers should be merged into the agricultural field for management. The number of people in Yucai and Tanzhen schools is too large, making teaching difficult, so they should be divided into classes for teaching. The school has been informed to comply. In addition to the required courses such as civic training, Mandarin, arithmetic, common sense, single-level primary school teaching methods, and knowledge that private school teachers must know, there are also special lectures for all subjects in the training class, which are held once every Saturday evening. The teachers for the special lectures have been separately appointed by the Education Bureau. All the hired lecturers are municipal primary school principals with rich teaching experience and in-depth research, as well as inspectors from the Education Bureau. The list of special lecturers and lecture topics is copied as follows: Gu Yinqian, discussion of practical education problems; Qian Xuanqing, primary school teaching materials; Tong Shicha, private school administration; Chai Zifei, social problems; Xu Shushen, political research guidance; Wang Jingqing, health education; Wang Jianren, implementation of training; Gao Jie, child psychology; Qian Songping, principles of education; Lü Xinfu, practical problems in private school reform. The above ten people will give a lecture once a week, and five weeks can be lectured in five places, which can be completed in ten weeks.</p>

<p>The Central People's Movement Guidance Committee stipulates that all training directors and civic teachers who have passed the examination and have been hired by various schools should report their work progress each semester to the Examination Committee for review. The Committee for Reviewing the Qualifications of Training Directors and Civic Teachers in Secondary Schools in this city has long issued an order to comply with it. According to Yu Zhongju, a member of the committee, the reporter of the National News Agency said yesterday that many training directors and civic teachers from various schools have submitted their work situation in the last semester, but there are still many who have not reported it. It is now planned to impose sanctions on the training directors and civic teachers of various schools who have not fulfilled the reporting procedures, according to the central regulations.</p>

<p>The sincerity expressed in his words and expression made Mrs. Shu unconsciously put her hand on his shoulder, and said to him in her most affectionate tone:</p>
<p>"Then come with your friend, Ned; I think we must find a way for him, without you having to give up your position."</p>
<p>Ned ran off happily and soon returned, followed by the most lackluster big boy, who slunk in with his eyebrows drooped, looked around, half fierce and half resentful on his face, which made Mrs. Pei whisper to herself:</p>
<p>"A piece of bad goods, I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"This is Don," Ned introduced him, thinking he would be welcomed.</p>
<p>"Ned tells me you're willing to come and join us," Mrs. Shu began in a kindly voice.</p>
<p>But only a rough, abrupt, simple answer came—"Yes."</p>
<p>"Don't you have any friends to take care of you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Say 'No, ma'am,'" Ned gently told him.</p>
<p>"Who cares!" Don answered resentfully.</p>

<p>The places where I work are all bustling places, such as theaters, film companies, one with constant singing and dancing, and the other with bright silver lights, reaching the extreme of sensuous and luxurious. Even the newspaper office where I used to work was full of beauties and constant music. However, I am as desolate as ever, still calm: because my state of mind is not shifted by the environment.</p>
<p>The beauty of sickliness, the Daiyu type, has been listed as something to be overthrown. Even the gentle and affectionate, quality Yu type, is not suitable for the times. It can be seen from the fact that modern women are fond of athletes.</p>
<p>Those who like to eat onions and chives call it fragrant, and those who don't like to eat it call it stinky. With the determination of food preferences, the definitions of fragrance and stink are established, so it is no wonder that there is no true right or wrong in the world.</p>
<p>Fruits often have the effect of treating diseases. For example, apples can treat dysentery, figs can treat hemorrhoids, mashing cherries into a paste and applying it to hands and feet can prevent chapped skin in winter, loquat leaves can treat coughs, lychee kernels and musk powder mixed with vinegar juice can treat ringworm, children eating small grapes can avoid smallpox, betel nuts can help digestion, sun-dried lotus root sections, after a cold year, decocting and drinking it can relieve chest congestion, bananas can relieve constipation, orange peels can resolve phlegm, olives can detoxify alcohol, roasted pears can treat chapped skin when washing the face with the hot water, accidentally swallowing a copper coin can be solved by eating water chestnuts, corn roots and leaves can treat urinary dribbling, hyacinth beans can stop vomiting, eggplant flowers can treat traumatic toothaches, peach blossoms can treat abdominal pain, and sugarcane can treat malaria.</p>
<p>Shanghainese use 弄 (lòng, lane) for 衖 (lòng, lane); for example, Hongmiao Lane is written as 虹廟弄, Xiangfen Lane is written as 香粉弄, and Xieqiao Lane is written as 斜橋弄. In fact, 衖 should be cut after 巷 (xiàng, alley), which is the same as 巷 (xiàng, alley), and should not be read as 弄 (nòng, do).</p>
<h3 id="e171">Four Foreign Suitcases <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>It is said that due to the devaluation of the US dollar, the number of Chinese students going to the United States for further study every summer is increasing year by year. Originally, studying is not a "capital-profit" business! Being able to reduce "costs" without affecting his title as a student abroad is really "getting a good deal"!</p>
<p>However, what do our compatriots bring back every year when they send a large amount of gold dollars to the United States? This loss-making account is difficult to calculate! If you must check this account, I have to honestly tell you: I don't know about other students abroad, but my friend Mr. X brought back four foreign suitcases!</p>
<p>That day, someone reported to me the news that he was coming to Shanghai from the United States, but because he was not an important person, it was said that no one was going to welcome him! Wasn't there a "grand occasion" when their large group of students went abroad two years ago! Now they are returning to their motherland dispiritedly, and no one pays attention to them. I think this may be because they are returning with loss-making account books! However, my friend Mr. X brought back four foreign suitcases! Even if it's a loss, it won't be "auctioned at the reserve price"!</p>
<p>A week after that day, he came to my house to see me. After I shook hands with him, I eagerly asked him if he had brought anything back. He sighed and said, "I brought four foreign suitcases to the motherland,——one suitcase is candies for the children to eat, one suitcase is clothes and utensils, one suitcase is Western books prepared to be displayed on Beijing Road, and one suitcase is full of dirty, torn shirts and socks!" Speaking of this, he laughed with emotion! But then he explained that the cost of washing a shirt in the United States was about the same as buying a new one, indicating the reason why his suitcase of dirty shirts and socks was piled up.</p>
<p>Finally, he said that although he had made considerable progress in his studies after studying hard in the United States for two years, he would feel the pain of unemployment at least temporarily when he returned to the motherland! I had nothing to say to comfort him. We talked about the most "fashionable" problems in Africa and Asia, and he got up and left. I mechanically sent him out the door, and I seemed to see four foreign suitcases in front of me!</p>
<h3 id="e172">Feather Fan <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Some time ago, I seemed to remember seeing Zhuge Liang in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms never leaving his feather fan. He was not afraid of the heat and needed it, just look at him holding it in his hand even in the coldest weather: then it can be known that his feather fan has other wonderful uses. However, similarly, Xu Maogong of the Tang Dynasty also had a fan, and Wu Yong in Water Margin also often had a feather fan in his hand, and even every military advisor used such a feather fan. So I think, perhaps they used this feather fan to help them use their thoughts and plan strategies: just as modern writers smoke, ancient writers loved to drink, which is the wonderful skill of the right wing.</p>
<p>However, the current feather fan is not exclusively used by military advisors, nor is it useful in winter, but it is used to dispel heat in summer.</p>
<p>This kind of feather fan is produced in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province. There are many feather fan shops there. They are like fur shops in Shanghai, but one specializes in winter business and the other only makes money in summer. After this season, they close their doors and wait for this time next year. Or, they may change to opening cotton shops in winter; therefore, cotton is used for winter business, while feather fans are used for summer, so this method is very suitable.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of feather fans, and the colors are gray, pure white, mottled, and red and green; however, red and green are dyed. The styles include Buddha's hand, chicken heart, round, flat head, and folding fan, and the price ranges from a few cents to more than ten dollars. The feathers are entirely from outside Tongmen, but they must be made in Huzhou to be famous, because it is said that the water under the Luotuo Bridge in Huzhou is phoenix water, so the feathers for making fans must be washed with water to be bright and soft. And it is said that this kind of feather fan can be used to remove wind, cold, evil heat, and other minor diseases.</p>

<p>— (Ji Yijie)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Yang from the Northwest Training Office sent a letter informing us of the ancient relics of Cao Mengde meeting Ma Chao in Tongguan in the past. According to him: Tongguan was famous during the Three Kingdoms period. Ma Chao chased Cao Cao here. The pass is very dangerous, and it is true that one man guards the pass, and ten thousand men cannot pass. There is also an ancient relic, that is, on an ancient locust tree, there is Ma Chao's spear hole. It is said that Ma Chao chased Cao Cao to Tongguan, but failed to catch up. Ma Chao shot out a spear, which did not hit Cao's head, but hit the locust tree. Cao survived and later sealed the tree as a tree god. This locust tree is located in the Zhongfu Tianle shop on Dongdajie Street in Tongguan. The tree can be embraced by four people and is about fourteen feet high. Most of it is withered, but a small branch is still alive. There is a hole about a foot away from the ground, about one inch in diameter and one foot high, which is Ma Chao's spear hole. These are the remains of Cao Cao meeting Ma Chao in Tongguan, and so on.</p>

<p>Chapter Eighteen: Relatives of the Qi Faction Flatter and Grovel, A Petty Official Rebukes; A Ferocious Woman Creates a Great Disturbance, Annoying the Madam</p>
<p>The two runners chased to the stairs but couldn’t catch him, landing a kick on his shoulder. The accountant's body was already weakened from overwork, and this kick sent him tumbling and rolling down the stairs. Two waiters quickly helped him up. He looked around and saw dozens of travelers standing in the lobby. He sighed and shook his head twice. Two nosy travelers immediately asked him what had happened. The accountant stood in the middle of the lobby, looked at everyone, and said with a bitter smile, "I haven't offended any wealthy people. It's all because of you all not sleeping at such a late hour and making so much noise, which angered Madam Lan. I don't know whose family member was crying for a while, but Madam Lan said that if this traveler didn't stop crying, I should throw him out. You think we, who are in business, would dare to do that?" Everyone was in an uproar after hearing this. At this moment, the clerk, Qiu Zecheng, came down from upstairs and said to the accountant, "You are wrong. You were so rude to the madam just now, arguing with her at every turn. Now you are making reckless remarks in front of so many people." The accountant said, "I'm telling the truth. What did I say that wasn't true?" Zecheng said, "Madam Lan is still angry. Follow my advice, come upstairs with me, apologize to the madam, and it will be over." The accountant said, "Even if the travelers were noisy and disturbed the madam, it's not my fault. I've already been beaten and scolded. Why should I apologize?" Zecheng said sternly, "Don't you know? Earlier, a waiter went upstairs and was disrespectful to the madam. I personally heard you say that you used to work a minor official job and had seen all kinds of big shots. The madam said you looked down on the commissioner and insisted on sending you to the Public Security Bureau. I repeatedly pleaded for you, and she finally agreed to let you off if you bowed and apologized. Otherwise, she would call the police right away." Seeing Zecheng speaking calmly, the accountant naturally believed him and was stunned. But at that moment, someone in the crowd shouted "Hit him!" Immediately, everyone echoed, shouting "Hit him!" The commotion quickly escalated. (314)</p>

<h3 id="e176">Candle Creek Lake <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— By Shufan</p>
<p>Yaojiang, the hometown of Wang Yangming, has beautiful mountains and rivers, second only to Kuaiji Creek. Mounts such as Kexing and Longquan have a constant stream of visitors, and many poems and essays celebrate their hidden beauty. However, the clear seclusion of the creeks and ponds and the strange beauty of the lake scenery are rarely mentioned. It's not that they are lacking, but because the place is remote and unknown, the water is used as a grazing area, isolated from the world.</p>
<p>The entire county has four lakes: Huangsha, Fuzi, Candle Creek, and Shanglin, with Candle Creek being particularly beautiful. It is located thirty miles northeast of the county, covering an area of over 14,000 acres, surrounded by mountains on three sides, a pristine scenic area! Take the Yuhu Highway bus to Henghe Town, get off the bus, and walk south for half an hour to reach it. Near the lake, the Siming Mountains are lush and dense, with no gaps in the sky. Following the winding green path, one suddenly emerges into an open space, revealing the clear lake, with reeds and rushes like clean brooms, sweeping through it. Ying Mountain cuts across the heart of the lake, appearing narrow and cramped. To the south, beyond Zhelu Forest, Guigang, and Yangmei Peak, the summit of Ying Mountain offers a panoramic view of the entire lake, without any hidden spots. Lion Ridge lies to the southwest, and looking east towards Xulang, wild chrysanthemums cover the mountainside like unmelted snow. Many small boats are on the lake, and fishing boats carry guests, the shadows of oars and the sounds of birds, the bamboo hats and the rustling trees, offering quiet pleasure in the midst of slight noise, making it impossible to fully describe its beauty! The sandbars emerge and disappear in the mist, like dragonflies skimming the water, with Ying Mountain seemingly about to swoop down and snatch them. According to historical records, the sandbar is the tomb of Sun Qinglian from the Tang Dynasty, and it is strange that it is not submerged even during high tides. The lake follows the foothills, making a large bend, with its western end deeply penetrating Xin'an, densely covered with sedges, and the misty peaks blending into one color. According to mountain farmers, many geese gather on the lake in winter, and people can catch five or six hundred in a day using nets, a benefit that cannot be rivaled; the richness of the aquatic products can be imagined. Descending the mountain, one can visit the tomb of Sun Zhonglie, named Sui, who lived at the same time as Wang Yangming and died in the disaster at Chenbin, as well as the tombs of his two filial sons, where the stone carvings of civil and military officials are well-preserved. The architecture of the previous dynasties is truly awe-inspiring. Walking through the dense shade, taking the road from Xulang, one can see thatched huts appearing and disappearing among the trees, terraced fields and ridges, and the sight of mountain people scolding oxen while plowing. All these scenes are worthy of artistic depiction! Xulang is the main peak surrounding the lake, and there is Yonggu Temple on the mountainside, suitable for cultivation and logging. The monks live a quiet life, without needing to seek connections with the outside world, resembling Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring, no less idyllic. Climbing further up, the sound of pines and streams create a unique harmony, with crows chiming in, making it a complete symphony of nature! There are ancient fir trees along the path, some with a circumference of over six spans, even more ancient and beautiful than those on the Tianzhang Road. The temple is not visible from below, but peering through the temple windows, one can see dozens of miles, as if the heavens opened up just for this view, leaving one in endless amazement! An old monk raises a fat ox, relying on each other for survival, creating a solitary sound in the valley, with no more than one or two visitors a year. Further up is Cuiping Temple, but due to the approaching dusk and the cold mist, we did not venture there. We spent the night in a farmer's house, drinking mountain wine, and slightly intoxicated, we surveyed the outdoors, seeing the bonfires by the lake shining brightly, reflecting on the waves, with colors like streamers. The people of Huangshan are still engaged in pottery. After two nights, we bid farewell to the host, with feelings of lingering affection that we couldn't suppress. I wrote a poem to commemorate the occasion:</p>
<p>Preparing weapons and raising cattle and sheep, this official land is abandoned and not yet filled, collecting pine needles at dusk to cook porridge with artemisia, the mountain home's hearth is also fragrant!</p>
<p>The mountain absorbs the dawn wind, turning into emerald waves, the water reflects the setting sun, wetting the rouge-like clouds, pitiful is the monk at Tiangu Temple's words: his white hair has no one to appreciate his good poems!</p>
<p>Begging for darkly brewed peach blossom wine, buying knife white fish for the ferry crossing, waking up not knowing what world this is? Mountain insects and branches of birds recite strange books.</p>
<p>Drunk, holding a sickle-shaped moon entering the south of the mountain, where to gather the secluded treasures hidden in winding paths? Cutting away the pine green, the clouds are white again, someone is filled with sorrow at Cuiping Temple!</p>
<p>Silently hiding my poems in my sleeves, I pass through the pine pass, feeling as free as clouds emerging from the mountains, accumulating clear coldness and startling April! Wild chrysanthemums are white all over Mount Xulang.</p>
<p>Amber moistens the moon setting in Mei'ao, emerald green stars scatter and reveal the sand, the old branches are twisted and ancient in the poems, the secluded charm of the lake is not related to flowers.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Now that the Empress Dowager was spending every day mingling with us young and beautiful court ladies, while it didn't necessarily spark any jealousy, the contrast inevitably made her feel that her own appearance was too old and haggard. So, she spared no effort in trying to preserve her fading beauty. Another thing she believed to be effective was human milk. Therefore, she had to drink more than half a bowl of human milk every day.</p>
<p>Since no one was giving birth in the palace, and no infants were being raised who were still being breastfed, where could they get this human milk every day?</p>
<p>It turned out that the Empress Dowager also had wet nurses! The Empress Dowager's wet nurses were carefully selected from the wives of those banner soldiers. They were naturally all young women who had just given birth. The selection was very cautious, with physical condition, appearance, and cleanliness being very important conditions. Sometimes, if they selected a particularly satisfactory woman whose appearance was also very beautiful, the Empress Dowager would definitely hire her for a long time and give her extra money so that she could hire another wet nurse to feed her own child. But this was very rare. Usually, they hired two or three at the same time, had them bring their children to live in the palace, and take turns squeezing milk out every morning for the Empress Dowager to drink. Once these wet nurses entered the palace, they were considered part of the Empress Dowager's attendants and were treated exceptionally well. The food they ate was exactly the same as what we ate. All utensils, clothing, and decorations were kept meticulously clean, as if they were guests coming to the palace. However, when squeezing milk every morning, the Empress Dowager still didn't dare to trust them and always had to send one of us to supervise. (414)</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with active trading due to positive news from Liverpool and rain in the East and Midwest. Traders and Liverpool merchants bid on nearby months, with prices rising two to six points for all months. However, heavy hedging, broker selling, and fears of increased Southern production slightly lowered prices. The Cotton Exchange announced that the transfer of monthly positions to the July contract had been completed, with 125,000 bales still held in New Orleans. If the October contract rises enough to attract selling, they will still be delivered. Near the close, local and Southern selling caused renewed weakness. As a result, spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose or fell by one point. British cotton spot prices rose by seven points, and futures prices rose by three to five points. Indian cotton futures traders and Japanese buyers were active, but met with European exporters. Bengal Fine rose 1.5 rupees, Oomra rose 4.25 rupees, and Broach White rose 2.25 rupees.

<p>— By Wang Weiyin</p>
<p>(1) The Significance of Studying Wheat: Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of human life, and the food problem is especially important. Human life cannot exist without food and drink, so we must study how to obtain food. For thousands of years, our country has been an agricultural nation, with rice and wheat being the main agricultural products. However, due to the different climates in the north and south, the rice and wheat producing areas are different. Therefore, in the farmland south of the Yangtze River, rice is planted in nineteen out of twenty fields. The wheat planted is only used as a secondary product after the rice harvest, so farmers do not pay much attention to it. North of the Yangtze River, the land is higher and the climate is colder, which is suitable for wheat cultivation, so there are fewer farmers growing rice in the north. Therefore, northerners eat wheat and southerners eat rice, and what we should eat is wheat. In other words, wheat can almost represent the wheat family. Therefore, if we want to study the food problem, we must first study wheat.</p>
<p>(2) The History of Wheat: Humans discovered wheat long before recorded history. Some believe that the original origin was Mesopotamia, from where it gradually spread to various places, west to the Canary Islands, and east to our country. However, as the Book of Songs says, "Give me wheat for the coming year," then China's planting of wheat was already in the Stone Age, and it spread to the entire Eastern Hemisphere. As for the Western Hemisphere's knowledge of wheat, it began in the 16th century. Around 1530, Mexico began to import wheat, and in 1610, the British colonies in North America also tried to plant it.</p>
<p>(3) Wheat is Easy to Change Varieties: Wheat adapts to the environment very quickly. Its properties are easily affected by the soil properties, climate conditions, and mixing of varieties of the place of production. Therefore, the types of wheat are also becoming more and more diverse. Here is an example to illustrate this: In a certain place in England, although white wheat is often cultivated and sown in a farm, after several harvests, it can turn red. If this red wheat is planted on the slopes of the Pacific coast of the United States, it will turn into white wheat after several years, which shows how easily the properties of wheat can change.</p>
<p>(4) Wheat Production Areas: Most areas of the world can grow wheat, but the rate of reproduction varies. The temperate zone is the largest wheat producing area, and our country and the United States belong to it. Argentina and Australia account for one-eighth of the world's production and are the main producing areas in the tropics. However, wheat is also cultivated in the highlands of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador in South America. Parts of northern Canada, which were previously thought to be unsuitable for wheat cultivation, have also begun to be planted in recent years. The most difficult thing to plant in the far north is frost. In this period, crops such as wheat are safer.</p>
<p>(5) Wheat products, but the climate and geology are different everywhere, so there are areas harvesting wheat at any time of the year. The harvest season in Australia, New Zealand, Algeria, and Chile is January. The harvest season in certain areas of India and Upper Egypt is February and March. Syria, Persia, and other areas of India are in April. Algeria, Central Asia, and Northern Asia Minor are in May. Our country and Japan are in May and June. The states south of 40 degrees north latitude in the United States are in June. Northern United States, Southern Russia, France, and Hungary are in July. Eastern Canada, England, Germany, and the Netherlands are in August. Russia, Sweden, Norway, and Scotland are in September. Northern Russia and Finland are in October. Peru and South Africa are in November. South Australia and Burma are in November. From a global perspective, the total harvest in June, July, and August accounts for three-quarters of the total. This situation is very important for the world wheat market. The different harvest times can regulate wheat production in various places, and there is no fear of a shortage.</p>
<p>(6) Classification of Wheat: Wheat is usually classified into winter wheat and spring wheat. Botanists do not use this classification method, but it is quite common in commerce. Toincutn Saticum is the most common type of wheat. Other more common types include Emmcr, Spelt, Durum Wheat (a type of hard wheat), club wheat or squarehead wheat. Pirl wheat is another type. Millers must be very careful in choosing and preparing wheat, depending on the flour they want to produce. Stores also choose flour in the same way, depending on the type of food they want to make. Therefore, flour must meet the specific needs of consumers. The main types of wheat are listed in detail below: (1) Common wheat, cultivated all over the world; (2) Club wheat, produced most in the Pacific coast of the United States; (3) Durum wheat, produced in various countries, mostly in Russia; (4) Poulard Wheat, produced in Europe and America, cultivated more in Spain, Portugal, and Italy; (5) Mummy Wheat, produced less, slightly cultivated in Europe; (6) Polish wheat, mostly produced along the Mediterranean coast; (7) Indian dwarf wheat, mostly produced in India; (8) Small or one grained Spelt, produced in Europe, Germany, Switzerland, and Turkey; (9) Emmer or two grainde Spelt, produced in Europe and India; (10) Large spelt, produced in Europe, mostly in Germany. In addition, the commercial classification method can be divided into summer wheat and winter wheat according to the season of sowing and germination (as mentioned above), and can be divided into white wheat, yellow wheat, and red wheat according to the color of the wheat skin. White wheat and yellow wheat have less gluten and are suitable for milling. Or it can be divided into hard wheat and soft wheat according to the hardness and softness of the wheat. Soft wheat is exclusively used for milling raw materials. (See "Recent Advanced Commodities" by Japanese, Itaguchi Takenosuke)</p>
<p>(7) The Uses of Wheat: Wheat is of good quality, rich in nutrients, and suitable for making noodles, dumplings, and bread. Therefore, flour products are more numerous than those made from any other grain flour. The demand for wheat from emerging manufacturers of breakfast foods is also increasing. Several decades ago, corn flour, rice, and oat flour, which were made in various ways, were the most important of our food, and have now entered the era of packaged food, so in addition to oats, large quantities of wheat, rye, barley, and rice are needed. Before this kind of food is packaged, it is steamed, boiled, or pickled by using a festival or it has become wheat essence and glucose after fermenting and pickling, so that it can be digested more easily, and there is no cooking process when it is taken. This is also one of the proofs of modern food progress, but research is not a one-day or two-day effort. Among the artificially manufactured foods of modern times, grain flakes made by rolling are first-class. The manufacturing method is to steam the hulled grains and roll them into thin flakes with rollers before they are dry. They can be put on the market after they are dry. This kind of food, the imported oatmeal currently sold on the market, is one of them, and the annual import quantity is not small. The natives in certain places in Southern Europe are accustomed to eating pasta and similar foods, but the consumption of this kind of food has now spread to other countries, and the manufacturing industry needs to use special wheat. Ordinary hard spring wheat or einkorn is not suitable. Manufacturers in the United States usually use Durum Wheat as raw material. The amount of wheat suitable for making pasta is found in Durum near the vicinity of Yafu in Italy, Algeria, and Russia and Poland in Southern Europe. Because the above wheat contains gluten, it is a valuable raw material for making pasta.</p>
<p>(8) The Future of Wheat Planting: During the Great War, all the participating countries, due to food shortages, made every effort to save flour and mix part of potatoes and corn to make flour. In the future, if it is necessary to reduce the consumption of wheat, this kind of substitute may be used for relief: but in terms of the various cooking uses of wheat, there seems to be no suitable substitute, because the biggest difference between wheat and other grains is that the gluten of wheat contains two kinds of proteins, one is Gliadjd and the other is Glnlenin, so it is a suitable material for making noodles. Whether other grains have these two proteins is not confirmed. Now, although the world's population continues to increase, the number of people eating wheat is increasing day by day compared with those who eat rye and corn. However, from the recent outlook for the future, there is no sign that we must save the consumption of wheat. One of the most noteworthy things about wheat production is that the supply of wheat worldwide mostly comes from countries with low yields per acre. This is because the planting of wheat has recently changed from manual labor to mechanized labor. Most wheat growers use large-scale machinery to cultivate on poorer land, but the main reason is that most of the world's wheat is still from crude cultivation systems. Intensive cultivation systems will increase the value of wheat production, which can be proved by the high productivity of a few European countries. This kind of production method seems to require higher costs and slightly higher prices to offset the various costs of producers. However, our production economic methods are not limited to this. Carefully selecting seeds, improving the organization of farm work, and more effective cooperation among producers in cultivation, harvesting, and selling crops can all increase the economic efficiency of crop production. If we want to reduce consumption and make the current wheat production supply more people to eat, it is impossible in reality.</p>
<p>But there is one thing that can be done, that is, to increase the world's cultivated area. In most areas of Western Europe, it seems that the maximum amount has been reached in terms of cultivated area and harvest. There is also no possibility of a large increase in the area of wheat cultivation in the United States; but by promoting the planting of arid crops with irrigation and drainage, and planting wheat on barren old fields, etc., it is still possible to open up a large number of wheat-producing acres in the United States. The expansion of other parts of the world is also enough to increase the wheat production area. The temperate zone of South America has a very large area that has not been opened up, and is mostly used for animal husbandry. Both Genggai and Paraguay also have land to be opened up for wheat cultivation. In the future, the vast land of Canada and the three parts of East, North, and South Africa will all be major wheat-growing areas. The output in our country and parts of Siberia may also gradually increase. If the irrigation method can be used, the number of acres of wheat production in Australia can also be increased. In short, the world's wheat production capacity will eventually be higher than it is now. As for the improvement of seeds and the invention of machinery, it is enough to make the output increase day by day. If we stick to the old methods and do not know how to improve, even if we do not encounter water and drought disasters and the population increases sharply, and the output is fixed, it can be inferred that in the future, there will be a day when food is not enough to be distributed. We, the citizens of a country that is called an agricultural country, should pay more attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Writing About a Typical Figure <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The so-called typical figure is not a special figure. On the contrary, it is a very ordinary and commonly seen figure. In real society, such a figure is often forgotten and not remembered because they are too ordinary and too commonly seen. On the other hand, they do possess all the characteristics of the social stratum to which they belong. However, once written about and discussed by people from the same or different social strata, they suddenly realize that this book contains a true reflection of themselves or someone they commonly see. This is a writing method in which the author abstracts from real society and concretizes it as a conclusion. Let's tentatively call this writing method "inductive." Lu Xun's Ah Q is an example. When "The True Story of Ah Q" was published, it caused a sensation in Chinese society. Among the readers with peasant characteristics, they suddenly saw such a figure that had long been forgotten.</p>
<p>However, social phenomena are constantly changing, and in extremely complex ways. At first glance, it seems like a kaleidoscope, with unfathomable depths. But upon closer observation, each phenomenon is not only interconnected and inseparable but also moves in the same direction, either declining or rising, for the same purpose. A genius writer can grasp the inevitability of its development in the dynamics of this phenomenon and mold a character with a potentially developing personality. When this figure is presented to the current real society, the reader may see a special figure, making them disbelieve that such a figure could exist in the world. But as time passes, under the inevitable laws, the conditions that made people doubt the existence of this figure are eliminated. This molded figure becomes more and more vivid, and finally, the real society is filled with real figures identical to the molded one. Then, people wake up as if from a dream and cannot help but exclaim, "There really is such a person!" The typicality of this molded figure is further expanded. Let's tentatively call this writing method "deductive." Turgenev's Bazarov is an example. The appearance of Bazarov greatly dissatisfied the Russian society at the time, as they believed that such a figure did not exist in society. However, years later, facts proved Bazarov's existence. The appearance of Bazarov was Turgenev exploring the general character of the Russian intellectual class at the time, finding its development direction, and giving it form.</p>
<p>What we have said above about the "inductive" and "deductive" writing methods only describes the formation process of the figure. It does not encompass the entire speculative process of the writer when creating the figure. The speculative process of a writer when creating a figure is very complex. They must expand the scope of speculation to the entire society, or at least understand the society in which this typical figure emerges. This depends on the writer's own level of practice in reality, and it is not just a matter of speculation.</p>
<p>We do not want to elaborate on this here. But regardless of the figure's formation process, the writer must accomplish a major task when creating a typical figure: that is, to try to omit unnecessary elaborations and make the figure stand out as much as possible. In other words, to write a typical figure, the writer must have a large group of unwritten figures in mind as a contrast to this typical figure, making the character of this typical figure very clear.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a short story by Chekhov titled "A Peculiar Man." In reality, the person depicted by Chekhov is not a peculiar person but a typical person. The story is very simple; it is about a gentleman named Guoyaf who goes to the midwife Maya to ask her to deliver his wife, introducing himself very seriously.</p>
<p>"I am an assistant teacher at a vocational school. My name is Guoyaf. I am asking you to deliver my wife. Please hurry."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the midwife quickly prepared to leave. He then said that the price should be agreed upon first. The midwife said it was fine to give whatever he wanted. However, he looked at the midwife coldly and firmly and said a lot: "No, I don't like that way. It's best to agree on the value first. I don't want to take advantage of you, and you don't want to take advantage of me. We should agree on the price first to avoid trouble later." He also said: "I work myself and respect other people's work. I don't like being harsh to people. I don't want to give you too little, and if you want too much, I will ask how much the market price is." So the two began to discuss the price. He would only offer two rubles, but the midwife did not agree. He simply ran out and did not ask her to go. However, half an hour later, he finally came back, offered three rubles, asked her to go, and added, "After the price is agreed upon, no additional money is allowed." However, when the midwife arrived at the house, delivered the baby, and congratulated him, saying, "It's done, thank God, there is another person in the world!" At that time, he still maintained a heartless, blank expression and said, "Very good. However, conversely, more sons also cost more money. A child is born only to wear clothes and eat!" This made the midwife tremble when she saw him. Finally, she saw him standing in front of her son, who was reading in elementary school, calmly saying: "You know how to drink, you should also know how to work. You just swallowed a mouthful, but you didn't think about how much a mouthful is worth. It's not earned by working. You should think about it while you eat..." This scared the midwife so much that she didn't dare to take the money and ran away...</p>
<p>In this short story of less than three thousand words, the writing is very economical. It can be said that there is not a single careless stroke, and every stroke is focused on molding Guoyaf's character: the character of a gentleman with a merchant's temperament. Although this is a Russian figure, a person who calculates every ounce is also commonly seen in Chinese society. This makes him a typical figure.</p>
<p>However, in writing about typical figures, it is easiest to turn into writing about psychological figures. That is, to develop the particularity abstracted from the universality of the figure as much as possible, even isolating this particularity and writing it as a truly peculiar person (such as the figures that appear in "Investiture of the Gods". Those cannot be regarded as typical figures but as "monsters"). The consequence is that the reader's likes and dislikes of the figures in the work become personal likes and dislikes, forgetting the social origins of the typical figure. The social value of art loses its existence here and makes the work something like a personal attack. Therefore, here, writing about typical figures still relies on the discovery of the sociology of personality. And the discovery of the sociology of personality must pay attention to the following two points: the socialization of personality and the reflection of the universality of particularity.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Mid-Autumn Festival Four Years Ago <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival has passed. In this autumn when the west wind is rising and the grass and trees are about to wither, some sentimental poets may again come up with a set of mournful chants like "Hearing more maple leaves fall, the sound of autumn drips." In the long autumn night, I am afraid they will rise up with the sigh of "Tossing and turning, unable to sleep, putting on clothes and wandering"?</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is a good festival for revelry, but it is also a day that makes people melancholy and sentimental. The so-called mood of "Raising your head to look at the bright moon, lowering your head to think of your hometown" is particularly prominent during this full moon. In the past, whenever I encountered this festival, I would always sadly think of my hometown. The scene of the whole family relying on the trees to enjoy the moon on the slope behind the village in my childhood made me feel extraordinarily lonely.</p>
<p>But now I no longer have this feeling. The urgency of life and the commotion of national affairs have alienated me from my hometown and diluted my attachment and nostalgia for my hometown. So this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, I was silent and did not complain or feel any emotion.</p>
<p>But I kept thinking about the Mid-Autumn Festival four years ago. Like a ghost possessing me, I think of that memorable, tragic, and great day every day.</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival four years ago, yes, the Mid-Autumn Festival four years ago! Many people may have forgotten that memorable day, right? But at that time, it did cause a huge wave. Everywhere you could hear impassioned speeches, and you could see actions that defied death at any time. Although the mountains and passes were so insurmountable, separated by layers, the "flocks of wild geese flying towards the Han Pass," their wailing, made the people of the whole country boil with enthusiasm, and their emotions were high. The calls to "reclaim the old mountains and rivers from the beginning" and shed blood outside the Great Wall merged into a greatest march, shaking everyone's soul and burning everyone's enthusiasm.</p>
<p>This memorable day - the Mid-Autumn Festival four years ago has passed for four years, and people are probably enjoying the joy of singing and dancing in peace. How can they still think of the scene at that time!</p>
<h3 id="e183">This is Shanghai (Part 2) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Dongli</p>
<p>"Please come in."</p>
<p>The medical doctor speaks Chinese very well.</p>
<p>Two women, one slender and snake-like walking in front, the other short and plump behind. Needless to say, they are dressed very luxuriously, their faces are covered with a layer of powder, their hair is permed, and they are wearing long earrings, just like the typical concubines in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Mr. Gu ××××."</p>
<p>The two women said together with a smile, speaking in English, the short and plump woman's voice slightly heavier.</p>
<p>The things after the meeting need not be described in detail. As usual, the doctor led one of his clients into the inner room, took off her clothes, and performed his duty of giving her an injection. After finishing one, he gave the second person an injection. While giving the injection, the doctor asked the client if her symptoms had improved in the past few days. If the female client shook her head, he would flash a charming look, smile, and although he did not say anything, he was implying, "Who told you not to listen to me and still do that good thing with your lover?" When the female clients denied his implication, he would not hesitate to say:</p>
<p>"Then, I'm telling you, give four more injections in a row, and I guarantee it will be cured!"</p>
<p>"As long as it's cured, I'm not afraid to spend money!" It was precisely because he saw through this that the doctor deliberately increased the price of the injection from the original three or four yuan to such a large amount as one hundred yuan. The injection fee is expensive, but that doesn't matter. The rich can spend money, and their unconcerned attitude towards spending money is just like the poor who take their own strength for granted. What's more, this doctor with medical degrees from two countries really did cure some of his clients' illnesses. However, no matter how many he cured, there were still many people getting infected. If you want to ask, "Why are so many people getting 'venereal diseases'?" It's better to ask "Why are there so many concubines in China!" These are both questions that no one can answer. Now, the doctor has finished giving injections to these two customers, and then three or four more brightly dressed women walked in.</p>
<p>What a great business! However, since there is no sign nailed outside the building and no advertisements have been placed in the newspaper, how can there be so many patients seeking treatment! The effectiveness of word-of-mouth transmission is probably no less than that of paid advertisements in newspapers. The doctor saw this clearly, so he often urged his female clients:</p>
<p>"Introduce a few more to me. You know a lot of people."</p>
<p>Most of the people they know are concubines like them, and many of their peers have the same symptoms. Just think, if a man has four or five women, he will inevitably be unable to take care of them all. Can you blame the women for secretly finding other ways out? Can they avoid getting "venereal diseases"? Since they can ask for more money from men, they will naturally come here for treatment. This Derby medical doctor is simply having good luck.</p>
<p>However, do you really think this Derby medical doctor is the real deal? Wrong. Not only is he not a medical doctor from Derby, but he is not even qualified to be a "bachelor"! He only fooled around in a local secondary medical school in his hometown, and later worked as an assistant in a small local hospital for a year. After that, he stayed at home for five years, and in the sixth year, he came to Shanghai on a presidential ship.</p>
<p>"It's easy to make money in Shanghai, and it's even more profitable to practice medicine. Rich Chinese people are superstitious about foreign doctors!"</p>
<p>Thanks to an uncle who came back to his hometown from Shanghai and told him this way to make money, he came to Shanghai to seek a living. Now he has really made a fortune. His uncle's words were not false, because stubborn female clients often scolded those Chinese Western doctors in front of him for being half-baked and incompetent.</p>
<p>This night, until twelve o'clock, the doctor treated a total of thirteen female clients for venereal diseases.</p>

<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>"How wonderful it would be to have Xiaocui by my side."</p>
<p>In the terrifying atmosphere, she suddenly thought of Xiaocui. This girl was a companion when she was at home. Although she couldn't do much heavy work, she could pick grass in the graveyard and help add firewood to the stove. Even if she didn't do any work, it would be good. A fourteen or fifteen-year-old child, running around and playing with a puppy (she couldn't find other companions nearby), sometimes picking a string of poplar catkins or some wildflowers and pinning them on her black braids, turning her face to admire herself for a while before jumping to her mother and pulling her, saying it was good. In the spring, she picked up a small bird learning to fly that had fallen down and raised it, like a mother caressing a child, raising it until it could fly, and then teaching it some tricks. She and the puppy chased each other year-round in these graves. She found this independent world very lovely. In the spring, flowers of various colors bloomed in the graves, and she picked them and sat on the ground pressing the thick snow, their hearts indescribably bright.</p>
<p>"Xiaocui is a child in the embrace of nature."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Wang Er wouldn't say this sentence, but she did have this meaning. When Xiaocui's father was away, she would sit beside her mother with a smile on her face and say, "Mom, I love you," and then use her right hand to bend down the thumb of her left hand, "I also love Grandpa," bending down the first finger. "I also love Xiaohei" (she always called the puppy that), and the third finger also fell down. Finally, she leaned coquettishly into her mother's arms and said, "Mom, let's four of us be together for the rest of our lives."</p>
<p>Xiaohei burst open the split bamboo door and came in, covered in grass leaves. She suddenly woke up from her daytime dream. Xiaohei walked up to her and shivered, the grass splashing around, and it lay down leaning against its mistress's leg, wagging its tail uncontrollably, humming and making loving sounds.</p>
<p>Fear no longer existed in Sister-in-law Wang Er's heart at this time. But sadness filled that emptiness. Xiaocui was still guarding her last year, but this year, alas, she looked at the puppy and tears almost fell. Xiaohei raised its head as if it were also remembering something.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Wang Er said that she was a pitiful person. She followed Wang Er in her twenties, leaving only a debt, and now she is over forty years old, with nothing else to hope for. It would be good if she had raised a daughter, but she had been sold by her hateful husband last year. She was sold as a concubine to Li Er, the young master of the flower country. Because of this, the couple had argued countless times, and had even fought a few times, but the husband is heaven, and what strength can overcome heaven? Moreover, the husband had a good reason. He said that a daughter could not start a family anyway, and would have to marry sooner or later. Li Er was a shopkeeper (note) with power and influence, and the lives of our whole family were in his hands. Last year, during the Cold Food Festival, the second young master came to add soil, and Xiaocui, who was watching the burning of paper money to the gods next to him, was picked on by the second young master, who was determined to make her his concubine. Sister-in-law Wang Er heard this and refused to die, firstly because the child was small and she couldn't bear to part with her, and secondly because everyone knew how fierce Li Er's wife was, and besides, there were a large family of old and young in Li Er's family, and Xiaocui, a widowed girl, couldn't support them. But the husband didn't think so. He said that since the young master had taken a fancy to her, there was no way, and besides, he could get a hundred silver dollars. He planned to tell Sister-in-law Wang Er to use this hundred dollars to buy an acre of land to plant, and save the grain, and then buy a calf, and hire a child to let it graze, and at the same time, it could help with the work. The husband's plan was very thorough, as if as long as Xiaocui was sold, the long-term plan could be settled. Sister-in-law Wu Er was speechless after being told by her husband at night, but when she saw Xiaocui's lively appearance the next morning, she immediately changed her mind again.</p>
<p>The husband is heaven, and what strength can overcome heaven?</p>
<p>Xiaocui was finally carried away by a sedan chair from the Li family. One hundred dollars also became an acre of land.</p>
<p>However, this was not what the husband had planned. Not long after an acre of land was bought, it was surveyed by the automobile committee, and a white lime was sprinkled from the center without being crooked. The couple were so upset by this white lime that they didn't eat for many days. Sometimes, Wang Er suddenly woke up in the middle of the night and cried out, and when Sister-in-law Wang Er woke up in shock and asked him repeatedly, he just stared straight with both eyes, and it took a long time to catch his breath, "Oh, a car crushed Xiaocui!"</p>

<h3 id="e186">On Beauties <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Gu</p>
<p>The terms "standard beauty" and "model beauty" are really novel and elegant, but I really don't understand the meaning of these two terms. Standard, is it like a standard clock, standard cigarettes, etc.? Model, is it like a model factory, model prison, etc.? If so, then all women must be born exactly like them to be called beauties, otherwise, no matter how charming and beautiful you are, you cannot be called a beauty. Suppose you want to raise a pretty daughter, you must pre-make such a model.</p>
<p>The ancients had imagined an ideal beauty, saying that adding an inch would be too long, reducing an inch would be too short, applying rouge would be too red, and applying powder would be too white. It was moderate in length and short, and the fat and thin were appropriate, but he was only imagining and fabricating. To this day, no such standard and model beauty has appeared. Even the beauties called by the ancients were not exactly the same in size, length, black and white, fat and thin, so who is the standard, and who is not the standard? Who is the model, and who is not the model?</p>
<p>Women only have beauty and ugliness, there is no standard or model. Moreover, the meanings of standard and model are originally the same, but the faces of standard beauties and model beauties are definitely not the same, so who is the standard and who is the model? Only heaven knows. The ancients said, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," and also said, "Other people's wives are better." These words are originally biased towards emotions, but the viewpoint in the eyes of a lover and the viewpoint in the eyes of a non-lover are ultimately different. So are the so-called standards and models all the tone of lovers?</p>
<p>In today's world of eroticism, everyone has forgotten the country's shame and misfortune, and are desperately supporting the beauty's scene, hoping to win the beauty's frown and smile and spiritual pleasure. Therefore, school beauties, dance queens, flower country presidents, socialites, Shanghai Misses, etc., appear like fleeting spring clouds. Now these terms are also felt to be old-fashioned or outdated, so the terms standard beauty and model beauty have emerged in response to the times. I have nothing to say, I can only admire the Chinese people's intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Sketch of Beiping <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>(3) Water Carriers</p>
<p>Even on cold winter mornings, one can see many water carriers in every alleyway, pushing their heavy water carts. People curled up in warm quilts feel even colder when they hear the "Yi-ya, Yi-ai" sounds.</p>
<p>Every few alleys, there is a dilapidated house where a well occupies almost half of the space. The water drawn up by the pulley is poured into a trough beside the well. The water drawers and carters are all tall Shandong men.</p>
<p>Whether it is a cloudy day or a day with wind and sand, they brave the wind, bending their backs, using all their strength, stepping firmly, and laboriously pushing the carts. The hutongs of Beiping were originally like incense burners; when it rained, thawed, or snow melted, a half-foot of mud accumulated. The wheelbarrows often sank deeply into the mud, and even if those men strained their temples, they could not push them more than two or three steps. When you see a water carrier and his son on the street, one pulling in front and the other pushing behind, veins bulging, noses running, and stinking sweat pouring, it immediately reminds you of those mules struggling in the mire. What is the difference between their lives and theirs?</p>
<p>(4) Tianqiao (The Heavenly Bridge)</p>
<p>Tianqiao is the hell of the propertied and the paradise of the propertyless.</p>
<p>There are no high thresholds here. I cannot see ladies and wives decked out in finery, or young masters with slicked hair and powdered faces. I cannot see cars or smell perfume. But from morning onwards, many people rush here from all directions to seek their entertainment and pick up cheap goods.</p>
<p>On both sides of the road are small shops selling old stalls and old clothes. The clerks also perk up when they see you, using touching words to deal with you. "Want a gown? Want long trousers? Whatever you want, please come inside and take a look..." These are all good things, and the prices are very fair. As soon as one finishes speaking, the other interjects. The people who pick the items bargain prices. Village girls are touching the satin shoes with red flowers on the shoe stalls, with their heads held low.</p>
<p>In an extremely large earthen field, people have formed countless circles, and the smell of sweat assaults everyone's noses. On this side and that side, thousands of different voices rise up all the time, and the sellers have to shout at the top of their lungs. The sellers are mostly good men, and most of them have some skills. Those who wrestle sell their strength, and those who kick shuttlecocks and spin tops sell the flexible skills they have practiced for many years. Blood and sweat are their capital. Because of this, this job is also very difficult to earn a living. When they are playing energetically, they are very enthusiastic in cheering and clapping, "Damn, this kid!" They praise him like this with a smile. But when it's almost over, the clever people run away, and after bowing, there are only a few scattered copper coins on the ground.</p>
<p>When walking past the thatched sheds, you can always hear a burst of "Ai!... Cough... Dong... Dong... Dong... Yi Dong... Yi Dong..." This is the sound of singing "Dagushu" (a form of storytelling accompanied by drum). They are all young girls, or those who have lost their support, with a small handkerchief clipped between their fingers, forcing their thousand-pound eyelids open, straightening their voices, and singing from morning to noon, from noon to evening, to earn two or three hundred copper coins.</p>
<p>There are things to eat, things to play, and also so-called dental hospitals. In front of this "hospital," there is a square table with two glass bottles filled with yellow teeth. There are often many people seeking medical treatment inside the shop. Next to the hospital is a fortune-telling shop (there are so many fortune-telling shops in Tianqiao that it is really impossible to count them!). The "Free Palm Reading" slip is pressed under the stationery tube on the table, and business is quite good. Moreover, when talking to people from the countryside, they also show the unique attitude of a "prophet." The dentists have pliers, and the fortune-tellers have mouths. Everyone relies on their respective magic weapons to maintain their lives, but only heaven knows their skills.</p>
<p>This is their entertainment, their everything, their paradise!</p>
<p>Is this their entertainment, their everything, their paradise?</p>
<h3 id="e188">Random Notes by the River <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zhongshuo</p>
<p>(1) Boat</p>
<p>Originally, my body was a little sick, and my spirit was stimulated, so I woke up before dawn. I crawled out of bed and sat on the edge of the bed, staring blankly at the pitch-black sky, without a single star. The weather was very cool, with a hint of autumn. The rustling sound hurt my ears very badly. It turned out that it was raining, and it had been raining for several days. This lingering rain aggravated the depression in my heart.</p>
<p>At five o'clock, the sky outside the glass window gradually brightened. Dark clouds and thick fog were blown by the autumn wind to the south and moved a lot. The sound of soybean-sized raindrops hitting the roof tiles was like the weeping of a woman who had been wronged.</p>
<p>The sky was getting bigger. I rubbed my distracted eyes with my right hand and stood up from the edge of the bed and walked to the window. My body was almost shivering from the cold air in the morning. Reciting the lines "Autumn wind and autumn rain are so sad," I felt as if I had left reality and fallen into another illusory environment.</p>
<p>When my consciousness returned to its original state, I realized that my eyes were fixed on a sailing boat with a dark color and dilapidated masts on the river. The boat was going against the current, and several boatmen were inserting their poles into the water with all their might, trying hard to support it. At this time, my sight shifted to the shore, where three or four naked boatmen were pulling a rope with all their might. Those bodies, tanned black by the sunlight in June, aroused my envy. That solid, strong cured meat, and the fresh and obvious outlines all showed their spirit of fighting for survival.</p>
<p>(2) Pagoda</p>
<p>On the bank of the rapid river, there stands a pagoda that soars into the clouds and has a very strong medieval magical atmosphere. The pagoda was originally very high, but because it was built on top of a hill, it appeared even more majestic and arrogant. It is said that this pagoda has a history of more than a thousand years. Because the days are long, the beams, pillars, bricks, and tiles are inevitably moldy and rotten. Moreover, after the tourists climb and trample on it every spring and autumn, it becomes even more dangerous. Therefore, the local gentry all advocated that it must be repaired. Their superficial reason is that this pagoda has historical value and is famous in the country. But according to people familiar with the inside story, the main reason for repairing this pagoda is the turbulent river that is making trouble. "When the pagoda collapses, the river overflows," this is their unchanging theorem. The original intention of building the pagoda was to suppress the river god and make him lose his ability to make waves. Embankments can be ignored, but the pagoda cannot be repaired. This is also not surprising. The Chinese nation has such a deep concept of its ancestors that the cause created by the ancestors must be preserved, and the ancestral precepts must be followed. The pagoda was built by the ancestors, and it was also the ancestors who said that it should be used to suppress the river god.</p>
<p>Now, this repaired pagoda is even more magnificent, with painted beams and carved buildings, and gold and jade shining brightly, making it even more magnificent. However, since the pagoda was repaired, I have not often gone to that hill. I always feel that the strong smell of paint makes my breathing uncomfortable. When the weather is clear, I dare not even look at the gilded top of the pagoda, because the reflection of the sunlight will make my eyes feel strangely painful.</p>
<p>I remember that before the pagoda was repaired, I would quietly walk up the hill and into the pagoda after school every day. The abbot of the monastery next to the pagoda was too clever. He placed many mahogany tables and a dozen earthen rattan mats in the corridor. Whenever I came, the old man who made tea would bring a pot of hot Longjing tea. I would lie on the mat, take a sip of hot tea, rest for a while, unfold the book I brought, and read it slowly. When I saw something good, I would really clap my hands and applaud. When I was tired of reading, I might as well get up and pace back and forth, say happy words, and also look at the poems written by anonymous poets on the walls. Seeing that the sky was getting dark, the bell in the ancient temple issued an order to leave, and after paying for the tea, I quietly left the pagoda and went down the hill alone.</p>
<p>This kind of leisurely life was brutally deprived by those gentry who advocated repairing the pagoda to suppress the river and save the people. For a year, my heart seemed to have lost something, and it was extremely empty.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the pagoda, I sighed, feeling very depressed. Thinking of the past, I couldn't help but feel that all the past events were like drifting in the wind.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Ramblings from an Autumn Window <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— A Pure Child</p>
<p>I have loved sweets since I was a child, and now I am not yet thirty, but my mouth is full of cavities; but I still love sweets as much as ever. Half of this habit was formed because my grandmother spoiled me too much. She was fifty years old when she saw her grandson. Father sometimes saw that I was too indulgent and said to Grandmother with a smile, "This child will be spoiled by you." But Grandmother's reply was, "Why don't you have a few more children?"</p>
<p>As long as a child has someone to support him, he will do whatever he wants without any scruples. There are three osmanthus trees in my yard, and during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the whole yard is fragrant. It seemed to be the cook in my house who tricked me into thinking that osmanthus flowers tasted sweet. One day, I actually climbed a ladder to pick osmanthus flowers. Fortunately, I didn't cause any trouble, but I tasted the bitter flowers and twisted my grandmother every day for sweet osmanthus flowers. Later, my mother thought of a toy that she had made in her mother's house when she was a child—making osmanthus candy.</p>
<p>Readers probably have never tasted this special product that is both fragrant and sweet. Now is the time when the trees are covered with flowers, so I will tell you how to make it.</p>
<p>Osmanthus is a kind of small flower, and each flower has a thin stem. The bitter taste that I tasted was the juice of that stem, so when making osmanthus candy, you must remove the stems, but this is the most troublesome task. Because my mother was experienced, she invented the easiest procedure: when the osmanthus flowers are about to wither, spread a single quilt on the ground and shake the tree trunk. The flowers will separate from the flower stems and hang down. Although the yellow leaves and branches of the tree are mixed in, it is much easier than selecting and picking the flower stems.</p>
<p>When the work of selecting and picking the flowers is completed, put them in a ceramic jar, store them with clean water, so that the mud on the flowers will go into the water, use a stone mortar to mash the flowers, and mix them with sugar evenly. If you like almonds. In this way, it becomes a big ball of osmanthus candy like kneading flour.</p>
<p>Although I would grab and eat it at that time, this big ball of stuff cannot be stored for a long time. It has to go through another layer of printing board to make each piece of exquisite osmanthus candy, and then store it in a lime box, wait for the moisture to dry, and the candy can be stored for a long time without spoiling, and the color, aroma, and taste are all excellent.</p>
<p>Printing boards are sold in carving shops. On a rectangular wooden board, various patterns are carved in negative shape, such as pomegranates, double carp, a group of harmony... etc. On top of it, there is a thin cover board with the same area, and a hole is carved according to the outline of the pattern in the place where each pattern is equal. When making candy, wipe the carved wooden board with a wet towel (so that the sugar will not stick), cover it with the cover board, and pick a small piece of sugar and fill it in the empty hole. Each board can probably make four or five pieces. After filling all the empty holes, hold one end of the cover board and gently tap it on the table, and it will become a piece of exquisite osmanthus candy.</p>
<p>My sister is five years older than me, and she can help my mother make osmanthus candy, but she can hardly eat a few pieces. I eat it while doing it. Even after storing it in the lime box, I often secretly grab a few pieces and hide them in my pocket. Even if my grandmother and mother see it, they will smile and say nothing. But my sister pouts and says, "Why is only my younger brother allowed to eat?" She doesn't understand the position of a girl in this society. Now she is the mother of three children. Every autumn, she always remembers her younger brother who likes to eat candy and sends the made osmanthus candy from the post office. In last year's letter, she told me that because she sent a package of osmanthus candy to me, her eldest child cried for most of the day. Do you think it's shameful for an uncle and nephew to grab candy to eat? I replied in her letter: When you helped mother make candy when you were a child, you never</p>

<p>A few days ago, she said she had returned home. The osmanthus flowers this year are particularly lush. Perhaps they are busy making osmanthus candy now. I guess my eldest nephew will secretly say to my sister: Don't send it to my uncle. This will cause grandmother and mother to laugh endlessly, because they have seen the next generation of children again.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Yearning for the Sea <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Yun</p>
<p>"One copper coin, a heart full of sorrow, a copy of 'Marfa'."——Struggling up my tired body on the slightly warm beach, I picked up a seashell and wrote the above words in the sand.</p>
<p>After writing, I lay down again.</p>
<p>With eyes stimulated by the strong sunlight, I stared at the clean jade-blue sky and the clouds chasing each other like playing hide-and-seek. The mood was quiet, and the soul seemed to have entered another pure white paradise.</p>
<p>Over the years, the waves of life have tossed and turned my stable life, drifting, wandering, comforted by the spring breeze of the South, and also loved the invasion of the wind and sand of the North. From the season of peach blossoms and mandarin fish, it turned to the days of chrysanthemums and crabs; then again from the days of chrysanthemums, it turned to the season of peach blossoms. One time after another, the days were woven into a long string, flowing past like flowing water, flowing past——making my golden sweet dreams of childhood shatter, and dissolving my innocence and purity in the bitter taste of the sea of people. Occasionally, stealing a moment of leisure, I use a thousand kinds of complaining and longing words to trace the passing of that old dream.……</p>
<p>So, I turned my eyes to the sky again.——</p>
<p>The clouds were changing: like continuous mountains, also like a flock of sheep on the pasture,……Sometimes, they gather tightly together, and then slowly split apart, and the jade-blue sky shows a smiling face in the cracks.</p>
<p>The sea, under the calm and profound breath, is also changing like the clouds. Rolling its soft waist, when tired, it spurts out a mouthful of white foam.</p>
<p>In bursts, carrying the light breeze of autumn, the waves deliver the sound of the waves, as lovely as "Autumn Lullaby"!</p>
<p>When my eyes were about to take my soul into that pure realm, I opened the book. On the first page, the first paragraph, the first line is written:</p>
<p>"The sea is smiling."</p>
<p>Yes, the sea is always smiling. The bursts of waves may be the sound of laughter.——Although in the vast ocean, the waves are hard.</p>
<p>Thinking of hard work, I felt annoyed; so I threw the book away and closed my tired eyes.</p>
<p>In this way, I lightly sent most of the day into the land of sleep.……</p>
<p>Waking up, the sun had already set to the west.</p>
<p>(——The sea is smiling.)</p>
<p>(I am also smiling.——However, my smile has the flavor of autumn.)</p>

<p>Chunming has always been the most prosperous. It is lamentable that the extravagance of that generation is excessive. Now, only the traces of song halls and demon palaces remain. Heroes and young girls are swept away by the waves. Let's talk about a charming official lady. She is a modern and fresh social flower. Her manners are incomparably luxurious. The pearl on her palm is no different. She is said to be a fashionable and broad-minded young lady. She is indeed better than those broad-minded young masters who spend a thousand gold coins. Therefore, she is the most beautiful in the dance hall. She only loves the stylish and beautiful replies. She only envies the swaying waist in the grasp of the silver lamp. Mrs. Tao is a good friend in her boudoir. One night, she fell in love with her cousin in Hangzhou. It is laughable that the cousin. Asks a word. Answers a little. Points and covers for a while. The cheeks are flushed like the red sky. It is regrettable that she has a lot of longing in her heart. She often calls Mrs. Tao. Restaurants and cinemas. Music and 倍加. They often travel together in motorcycles. One is the Shouxiangzi who was first opened in chaos. One is a charming young woman. Don't say that his heart is as clear as water and free of dust. Who knows that he first made a promise to break the flower. It is laughable that a romantic and honey-like He Lina. She also went to the end of the world after failing in love. Fan Jashu in the spring-stricken inn was anxious. Fortunately, he met the old Yamen of Guan's family. Later, the bright moon was in the sky and the wind and snow were clear. The candle in the Western Mountain villa was swaying. The love between children is sold on credit with one stroke.</p>

One is a handsome and carefree ideal man. Relatives and friends come to congratulate. Female and male guests gather together. The banners and couplets are matched with each other. Auspicious words and great articles. The colorful procession raises high and opens the banquet. Fine dishes and fruits are packed in basins. Seafood and delicacies are placed on the table. The joyful atmosphere overflows the hall. Seven clever, three more, and four joys. Five Kui and eight horses drink fiercely. When the wine is over and the guests are gone, it is late at night. The couple enters the new house together. The groom has a spring breeze on his face. The bride shyly takes off her clothes. They are overturning the phoenix and overturning the dragon, and the happiness is endless.</p>

The king, because the father previously rendered meritorious service to the country, specially appointed him as an official and made his daughter his companion. However, when she grew up, because their social statuses were incompatible, the king found a way to send him on an expedition, so that he would be separated from the girl, and secretly married the girl to someone else. The prince was furious when he heard this, betrayed his father, but was eventually captured by his father. The old king died of excessive grief. The new king ascended the throne, welcomed back his lover, and made her the queen. The Garden Cinema is located west of the Cathay Cinema on Avenue Joffre.</p>

<p>"Newlywed Sweetness" and "Love Song," the two famous songs from the film "The Peach Blossom Fan," have been widely requested from the [New China] company with two cents postage after being recorded by Pathé and broadcast on various radio stations. New China has reprinted 100,000 copies of the songs for wide distribution.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>In our film industry, there are so-called "writer-stars." Initially, there were the "Three Stage Stars" Ai Xia, Wang Ying, and Hu Ping. Later, we often read articles by "Little Gao" Ping Qian. Now, it seems there are even more. Huang Hou from under Mount Emei, as well as Tong Yue Juan, etc., can all write a piece. And the influence of Ban Hua seems to be gaining momentum in recent days.</p>
<p>A friend came in complaining, saying, "In 'Literary Exchange,' you missed a very famous 'overseas returnee,' Hu Die. Didn't Miss Hu recently write a book about her European tour or something?"</p>
<p>Due to my friend's reminder, I was reminded of the "Eastern Standard Beauty" Xu Lai, who caused a sensation some time ago. Didn't Xu Lai also have something like "100 Days to Becoming a Performer"?</p>
<p>To say that female stars are shallow is truly deserving of a slap on the wrist. Just take the above facts as proof. Aren't our female stars "great" enough? How can they be shallow?</p>
<p>And due to the above facts, I predict that future stars will all be "writer-stars." Even those who are so illiterate that they have to have someone else write their signature will leap forward with this "progressive" trend.</p>
