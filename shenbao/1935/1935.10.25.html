<h3>法總理通告英大使　墨索里尼停戰條件　在阿比西尼亞闢租界　阿皇轄境須裁減軍備　意屬利比亞撤退一師團</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據巴黎晚報載稱、法總理賴伐爾今日已以墨索里尼提出停戰建議通告駐巴黎英大使克勒克爵士、聞其內容含有照中國數處所行之制度、在阿比西尼亞開闢租界，並將駐阿之武裝意軍减至某數、而成為警察、又要求在阿皇仍享有主權之境內裁减軍備、卽阿國僅准置常備軍、凡不在常備軍籍之阿人、槪不許携帶武器、聞意國準備在精神上尊重國聯之職務、而以五國委員會之報告書為談判之基礎、庶談判開始後由該委員會或行政院將此談判辦理完成、查意國所提議在阿之行政制度形式、與國聯盟約所載之委託代管制不同、阿國為國聯會員國、如對阿國援引盟約第二十二條與第二十二條、則將發生困難、故有採用租界制度之建議、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）近數月內、英意邦交緊張幾臻破裂點、今意相墨索里尼已撤退駐北菲意殖民地利比亞之意兵三師團之一、故兩國邦交因以大有轉機、據今日英外部宣稱、意政府照會英國、謂已下令撤退駐埃及邊界利比亞之步兵四聯隊、共八千人、惟該地將仍駐有軍隊、聞意政府之出此、乃因英外相霍爾星期二日在下院所發之演說、語氣和緩、及因駐羅馬英大使德魯蒙曾向墨索里尼提出保證之故、英國將如何答覆意國、今尙未决定、蓋意國今仍有兩師團駐於利比亞也、意國此次撤兵、並未附有條伴、未請英國作報答之姿勢、意國下令撤兵之消息、已立卽通知法總理賴伐爾、蓋賴氏現仍從事澄淸空氣也、解决阿案問題之外交談話，刻仍在進行中、、但羅馬方面謹慎自處、不欽過具樂觀、據意國官塲消息、此項談話就阿國爭議而論、尙未具體實現云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間今日官塲消息聲稱、意政府雖照會英國已諭令撤回駐利比亞兵士一師之衆、但未請英政府作相似之舉動、據此間人士之意見、意國此項動作固可熱切歡迎、但必不可視為一種條件、英官塲已明白表示英國方面現未有改變地中海艦隊支配之意、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間推測意軍自利比亞撤退之一師團現已調往特里波里、消息靈通方區，此純屬意方自動而為英所歡迎者、惟地中海英海軍現在並無减少之計劃、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本日總理兼外長賴伐爾在衆院外交委員會報吿政府外交政策中謂斯德萊柴會議之後、彼曾通知意相墨索里尼、調法國政策以國聯會盟約為基礎、萬一意國破壞盟約、則法國將被迫不得不對意實施經濟制裁云、賴伐爾又宣稱、法國始終擁護國聯會、當在國聯會機構之內、謀意阿問題之和平解决、又謂彼接得報吿、墨索里尼現巳準備撤回駐意屬菲洲西列內加三師軍隊中之一師云、外交委員會就國聯會盟約第十六條之解釋、向賴伐爾提出質詢時、賴伐爾則謂國聯各會員國中、如有一國因實施制裁、而遭侵略國之報復時、各國均應相互援助云、外交委員會散會後發表公報、謂法國忠實履行國聯會盟約義務、並當在日內瓦領導之下、以完全友誼態度、實行英法合作云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）、</p>
<p>小恊約國　對意實施制裁　德國態度尚未表示</p>
<p>（日內瓦）羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·捷克三小協約國今日照會國聯、謂已實施日內瓦所議决之對意兩種制裁、卽（一）禁止軍械及其他戰品運往意國、（二）斷絕財政關係、現禁止軍火運意者共有二十五國、與意斷絕財政關係者共五國（廿三日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國政府頃接得國聯會關於實施對意制裁之節略、至於德國如何答復、則官方不願有所宣佈、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）賴伐爾總理頃接見國聯大會制裁委員會主席葡萄牙駐法公使華斯貢賽洛斯、有所會商、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英下院　續辯外交事件　中日問題情形不同</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日為下院辯論外交事件之第二日、說者多以在中日爭議時國聯毫無與動、而在意阿衝突中則獨形活動為言、至官部閣員艾登發言答之、謂此兩事不可相提並論、强加比擬、實為錯誤、國聯並未宣佈日本為侵略國、中日爭議始終未發生任何一方從事戰爭之結果、中國未對日絕交、亦未援引盟約中規定制裁之第十六條、且有在實際上須考慮者、太平洋兩岸之兩大國皆非國聯會員國、故集體行動之必要條件、並不存在云、勞合喬治先艾登而發言、謂外相對於若干極重要事件、絕未言及、一月間之法意妥洽、與斯特萊薩之會議、其內溶可得而聞歟、法國在一月至九月之時期中、曾以烈性炸藥之蒸溜煤四百七十八噸及大砲所需之甘油六百九十七噸供給意國、在過去數日中、當然續有發展、不知英國果已依允撤回其地中海艦隊之一部否乎、」艾登答曰、余無所隱諱、日內瓦所有談判、悉載於盟約第十六條下、日內瓦委員會之報吿書中、至於英國擔任賠償他國損失之說、則須知吾人所擔任者、厥為盟約所規定者耳云、艾登繼詳述十二月以還之外交上活動、蓋欲駁斥英政府辦事迂緩之責言也、艾登言及一月至三月間之折衝、內有一次、親向墨索里尼交涉、又謂意國在三月底曾切實聲稱、願從速進行談判、及亟欲以溫和精神實施日內瓦原則、艾登追叙前事、至渠挾帶和解提前往游羅馬時為止、艾登謂此行無效、與以前數次同、英國謀取談判根據之努力終未成功、殊可扼腕、談判多時、每次談判輒歸失敗、其故以意國雖對於討論根據、亦不允接受也、</p>
<p>艾登答曰、吾人已再言之、喬治君殆以為異乎、苟讀意國報紙、則將不以為異矣、凡參加不愉快之辯論者、對此工作、不能高興、但有責任在焉、必踐行之云、（聞者、鼓掌）</p>
<p>今日首先發言者為首相鮑爾溫、開首即宣佈下屆總選舉定十一月十四日舉行、親國會定十一月二十六日集合、推舉議長、十二月三日英皇蒞院舉行、國會正式開幕禮、</p>
<p>鮑爾溫繼言外交事件、說明外相霍爾昨發之言論、字字為內閣所贊同、及閣員艾登在日內瓦之行動獲有內閣一致之同意等事、</p>
<p>鮑爾溫繼切言曰、吾人無自己行動之意志、或進行踰越吾人所能使國聯全體進行之度、吾人心意中從未存有戰爭二字、鮑爾溫殊不以引用戰爭二字為然、蓋此二字徒足鼓起人心之危險狀態、尤其在倚賴其政府供給消息之諸國中，鮑氏續謂此次爭案中所受之敎訓、已表明為世界和平計、吾人國防必須路今及所有者更為強固、渠非謂在實際上或想像上作片面重整軍備之舉動、以對付任何一國、渠心意中實欲在國聯機構內鞏固防務、以謀國際和平、而非達自私目的、吾人現正為和平而甘冒危險、政府除使英國之政策適合國聯所能實施之集體安全政策外、未見有其他途徑可行、渠現準備聚精會神以進行此政策、渠若不獲有充分之權力、以補救大戰後英國國防之缺陷、則不欲進行此政策、如國聯此次失敗、則吾人責當研究如何可使國聯能力充分之道、鮑氏末乃辯護其下令解散國會之行動、謂渠意早日舉行總選舉、可完全安順、若延至明年一月間舉行、則不敢作此言云、辯論將於明日繼籍進行、鮑爾溫不允予工黨以提出失業彈劾動議之時間、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>美國之最大報紙集團凡二。其一為哈斯脫氏所支配之哈斯脫報團。其一為賀華德氏Roy　W.Howard所支配之賀華德報團。美國之最大通訊社凡二。其一為美國許多報紙合辦之合衆通訊社。其一為賀華德氏所支配之聯合通訊社。賀華德氏乃現在美國新聞事業之最高權威。其思想之正確。能力經騐之豐富。眼光之犀利。非頑固之哈斯脫所可比擬。而已故之司克利普氏所驚為後生可畏者也今。賀華德氏乘參加菲列賓自治政府成立典禮之便。惠然來華。在京滬有二星期之勾留。吾人就報界立塲。當竭誠歡迎此美國最成功新聞家。吾人就中國國民立塲。更當竭誠歡迎此最合式之美國國民代表。</p>
<p>五十年來。司克利普氏與賀華德氏合營之報業。其進步殊可驚人。現該報團巳有報紙二十六家。自紐約至舊金山。無不有此報系之勢力。數年以前賀。華德氏購買紐約之「世界報」而改組之為「世界電訊報」。為此報團之中心報紙。自任為該報兼該報團之總經理。以極進步之經營方法。及極有力之社論政策。使此報紙一躍而為美國進步思想者之言論中心機關。使此報團不但於營業方面成功。且於指導民衆。監督政府工作上。收極大之效果。今美政府之對內經濟政第。對外邦交政策。有所宣佈。往往經過賀華德氏之諮詢。數年以來。彼最關心之問題。一為美國政府之經濟統制限度問題。二為中日美三國之關係問題。於此二問題。彼往往有極可注意之表示。九一八之際。彼於日本曾深致惋惜。然彼固竭力主張日美親善者也。數月以前。彼於羅斯福總統之經濟政策。曾有質問。總統以長函公開答覆。彼於總統雖有懷疑。然彼固竭力主張為經濟弱者求得利益者也。聯合通訊社之社稿。銷行於二千五百家之報紙。美國以外之報紙。訂用其社稿者。亦數百家。吾國國民通訊社。卽採用其稿件者。以一人之力。創辦如此大規模之事業。其精神可佩。其毅力可羨。吾人歡迎賀華德氏。甚望其於中國報業。有所指導與建議也。</p>
<p>抑吾人更有希望於賀華德氏者。報紙為民主國家至大權力之所自。報人為民主國家之頒導份子。對內則負啟發民智及指導政治之責。對外則代表全體國民。傳達及溝通各民族之意見。促進國際之友誼與和睦。賀華德氏過去於此二方面。已有甚大之努力。此次來華勾留二星期。於中國人民之願望。當更能了解。於中日美三國糾紛危機之所在。當更有精確之認識。因此而以輿論之力。促政府之注意。啟美國一萬萬二千萬人民之對中國問題之了解。不但於中美傳統之友誼。有所增進。於太平洋問題之解决。當亦有至重要之貢獻也。今美國半數以上之讀報者。半數以上之知識階級。以賀華德系報紙及聯合通信社為其耳目。美國新聞事業受政府之信任。得民衆之擁護者。以此系報業為最。太平洋左右岸六萬萬人民之戚情及思想。賴賀華德氏為橋梁。願賀華德氏善用其重要地位。與難得之機會。為此二大國國民。盡報人之高尙職責。此亦吾人於歡迎之餘。願向賀華德氏表示之希望也。</p>

。那老保姆直到他死了之後，方始知道伊的道位老女伴，實在是一個男子，終於很寂寞的葬在聖彼克拉墳塲中了。遊踪所至湖上散記  火雪明　　秋，正像幽雅的姑娘，披一襲衫，在月明中，輕輕地向薔薇花底慢行；雖則有些寂寞，却絡波漾着淡逸的香韻。這季節，為了偭性習於沉靜，往往勾起一縷遐思，要向河山傾吐。所以每到灼膚的夏日放弛了它的神威，而蘋末吹起微風的時候，我最愛躑躅在海角天涯，去搜回自己汨滅立都市中的純潔的精魂。你不瞧瞧秋旣這樣澹泊，明朗，窈速，沉着；為，什麼還不呌我記憶起杭州的西湖來？　　也許有人已嫌棄那個歐洲化了的中國靈境的南宋古都，然而那决不是現代寨美者所宜有的眼光。不」定竹籬茅舍之間着個飲酒的農夫，才算一幅晝稿；也不一定在垂柳秋溪，點幾個鸕驚小船，才算精緻的詩情；要知道搿斯林氣息中的打鐵匠，伏爾伽岸上的勞働者，也都是現實生活被贊頌的描寫，任你作詩或畫，也會流出最珍貴的情操。同樣，西湖的山頭，縱然聳了紅琉璃瓦與尅羅彌的別墅，但掩映於嫩波綠楊之間，由我看來，不僅不曾消失了西湖的美，而且增加了西湖的美。人就是愛好用古老不變的一貫的信心，在腦膜中充滿了宋元古晝的儒生氣質，去人亦云地批判。現代建築的藝術，那還會有什麼成就？只知道自已可以坐流行綫的汽車，向京杭國道上飽輾塵埃，一到湖濱，就會從雪茄烟的唇上，滑出自名風雅的議論，滿口詆駡洋氣之不足道，怎不令人笑歪嘴吧？這種人，不論什麼東西，如果越古越殘，就算是好；越新越整，便是不好，從不曾低頭想一想：由殷墟中掘出來的銅磚鼎彝，二千年前也還平凡得很，而現今正在重建中的南屏凈慈寺，焉知冉越三百年，那畫棟雕樑，都化為古樸典雅了呢。　　至於今所以輕視西湖，也還是最近年來之事。其原因，不外乎五省交通公路開展的結果，把以前舟車不便的地方，到而今都可直達，於是向來以「天堂」被贊的杭州，除作旅人必經的歇脚處外，專鬥搜尋南北山峯者，逐漸减少了。其次，社會經濟的貧困，使人無力費了多大的車資，去上三天竺進香，也是事實。宣傳的人一少，吸力也就淡薄，何况西湖雖上海覺得太近？　　湖上的霧眞好，比雨天美，太陽一開，朦朧的趣味消失，幻想也被打破，此時泛舟，就沒意味。但是微雨黃昏，船頭上掛一盞紅燈，讓遠處的艇子，瞧見了會引起靈奇的幽情，恰與我瞧見他們的紅燈一樣，倒極風趣。而且湖波的謳歌，在雙槳下奏出一夜之秘密」，有時槳觸尊蓼，大有張三影「雙槳歸時聞草聲」的境界。靜靜傾聽，宇宙可為僩人所有。　　總之，遊西湖的條件，必需體味得一個「閒」字方得。而批判西湖的美，再不能拘泥於讀中國古畫的意識之下了。</p>

<p>中國科學社廿週紀念特刊中國科學社二十年之廻顧  任鴻雋　　中國科學社之成立，迄今已二十年。此二十年中，經過空前之世界大戰，經過中國之國民革命，經過無數無數社會思想之變遷。然而本社事業不唯未受此等影響，且繼長增高以有今日之規模局面。吾人廻顧之餘，固不僅為本社慶，且為中國科學前途慶也。　　溯二十年前本社成立之始，不過少數學子，目擊西方文化之昌明，與吾國學術思想之落後，以為雖從根本上救治，非紹介整個的科學思想不為功。於是秉毛錐，事不律，欲乞靈於文字的鼓吹，以成所謂思想革新之大業，此科學月刋之作，所以為吾社所最先有事也。此報今已出至第十九卷第十期，於宣傳科學進步與提倡科學研究不無微勞足錄，當亦吾國學界所共認者。　　其次則以為欲圖科學進步，與其載之空言，不如見諸行事之深切著明。於是民國十一年秋乃有生物研究所之設立。此所成立，實為國內私人團體設立研究所之噶矢。然當時吾社竭蹶經營之情形，言之有令人失笑者。此研究所成立之始，研究員皆無薪給，常年經費不過數百元。今則合社外之補助與社內之經費計之，每月支出當在五千元以上。至該所之出品與成績，在世界生物學界中已有定評，無須吾人更為申說。今所欲言者，吾社提倡科學，而以研究所樹之規模，或與其他之空言無實者異其趣耳。　　更次則欲發展科學與便利研究，圖書館之設，實為必不可少，而亦學社所首當注意者也。吾社於民國八年開始組織圖書館，其時僅就南京社所闢室數椽，為社員公共庋藏書籍之所。今則上海建有明復圖書館，藏科學書籍以萬計，藏中外科學雜誌種類以百計，儼然為東南文化添一寳藏。近更添設科學圖書儀器公司，努力於出版及供給儀器工作，將來對於發展科學之貢獻正未有艾。如近年出有科學畫報半月刋，為出版界滿足一久經感到之需求，其一例也。　　然則本社以一私人學術團體，而能繼續發展至二十年之久，且能蒸蒸日上，若有無限前途者，其原動力安在？約而舉之，厥有數端：　　（一）社會之同情。本社發起之時，作始甚簡，設非社會上先覺前輩優予同情，其不易於發榮滋長長明矣。舉其要者，如蔡孑民，吳稚暉諸先生自民國四年旅居法國時，聞本社之發起，卽來函加以鼓勵。稍後則梁任公，馬相伯，汪精衛，孫哲生諸先生亦於精神物質各方面各有重大盡力。而歷年以來，各方友人以金錢或書籍贊助本社者，尤為指不勝屈。吾人敢斷言，設無社會上許多深厚之同情與鼓勵，絕無今日之本社，此吾人所當銘記不忘者也。　　（二）社員之努力。本社成立伊始，卽以各個社員之努力奮鬥為唯一自存之道。記在美國時，亡友楊杏佛君為「科學」總編輯，常以打油詩向趙元任君索文。趙君復以一詩云：「自從肯波去，這城如探湯，文章已寄上，夫子不敢當。（楊原詩有「寄語趙夫子，科學要文章」之句）纔完又要做，忙似閻羅王。（原注云Work　like　hell）幸有辟克歷，屆時還可大大的樂一塲。」猶可想見當時情趣。又胡明復君以天才絕學，以科學事業故，寗周守滬上，效死而勿去。稍後則研究所成立，努力於研究事業者更衆。如秉農山，錢雨農諸君，無冬，無夏，無星期，無晝夜，如往研究所，必見此數君者埋頭苦幹於其中。迄今社內外工作人員所為孜孜矻矻窮年不已者，蓋猶是此精神之表見耳。　　除上二者之外，吾人以為尙有一較為重要之原動力，有以驅策社外之贊助人士及社內之工作人員共同努力於發展科學之途者，則以科學眞理浩如烟海，凡具有文化之人類，卽有向此烟海搜求奧藏之義務。而且生存競爭，演而愈烈，凡生存繁榮之民族，必與其發見此奧藏之成績為正比例。此眞理朗列吾人目前，無論對於科學為崇拜，為懷疑，均不能加以否認。又况空前國難，相逼而來，吾人必須以研究科學者為解决民族問題之一重要途徑。然則吾人二十年以來之努力，其未可遽以為滿足，而必須再接再厲，以求更重大之貢獻，豈待言哉！豈待言哉！吾人甚願就本社舉行二十週年紀念之機會，以此意為本社祝，更為社內外工作之同志勉也。中國科學社的創始和現在  楊孝述　　二十年前的中國，還是在中學為體，西學為用的時代。國內所謂科學不過是學校課程中的點綴品，根本沒有研究科學的精神和風尙。還是幾個留學國外的學生，目覩歐美文明之盛，戚到只有科學是推進現代文化的主腦，要復興中國，非從努力科學着手，决難奏效。在民國二三年間，就有留學美國康南爾大學的幾位中國學生，鑒於祖國科學的缺乏，實業的不振，要想創辦一種科學雜誌來提倡。他們鼓吹了好久，到得民國三年的六月十日才開成一個會議，决定設立一個合股性質的「科學社」，作為發行科學雜誌的機關；每股股金定為美金五元，股東都有撰文的責任；並且推舉了任鴻雋，周仁，秉志，胡明復，趙元任五人為董事，楊銓為編輯部長，此外還有營業部長和推廣部長等名目，辦科學雜誌的戲就從此唱起來了。　　籌備了三個月的編輯工作，第一批稿子就託經理黃伯芹君帶到上海去出版。那時恰好是歐洲大戰開始的時候，他看見時事不好，幾乎要停辦。還是在美的社員熱心，决定堅持到底。後來請朱少屛君擔任經理，科學第一期居然在民國四年元旦誕生於神洲大陸。內容很可以說是應有盡有，不過因為採用橫行文字，且加上西文符號和句讀法，當時國內外頗有以好新無謂來非難的。但是科學的編者却抱定絕大自信力，以為科學文字責在明了不移，奧理新義多非中土所有，若長篇累牘不加符號句讀恐怕辭義之失於章句者將舉不勝舉了。社員胡適之君很表同情，就做了一篇論句讀及文字符號的文章，在科學二卷一期內發表，以代答復。所以科學可算是國內書報採用新式標點的首創者。　　每月出版一期雜誌，也得要有一筆印刷費。可憐這班在求學期間的靑年，偷出功夫做編輯工作，還須籌措經費。有限的股本决不濟事，他們不得不節衣縮食，繳納當時所謂特別月捐。其中有不少熱心份子，每天三餐都只是用一杯冷水，一疊麵包，夾一些花生醬，躱在自己房間裏充饑。如此之外，還有什麼法子想呢？　　科學發行了不久，社員中都感覺到科學社的宗旨旣是要振興科學，提唱實業，僅僅一個期刋，要想達到這個宗旨，豈不是夢想。就有鄒樹文君正式提議把科學社改為全國性質的學社。卽由董事會發信問全體股東的意見，得到一致贊成。四年六月間，董事會派任鴻雋，胡明復和鄒秉文三人為新社總章起草員，把科學社改名為中國科學社。會章在那年十月二十五日由全體社員通過。從此中國科學社遂吿正式成立，而中國之有科學學會也須以此為嚆失。在改組的那時候，共有社員一百一十五人，其中百分之八還仍在國外留學。　　到了民國六年三月，呈准敎育部立案。當時呈文中所列本社應舉的事業，有如下的九條：　　（一）發刋雜誌，以備播科學提倡研究。（二）譯著科學書籍。（三）編訂科學名詞，以期劃一而便讀者。（四）設立圖書館以供學者參考，（五）議定各科研究所，施行科學上之實騐，以求學術，實業與公益事業之進步。（六）設立博物館，搜集學術上，工業上，歷史上以及自然界動植礦物諸標本，陣列之以供研究。（七）舉行科學演講以普及科學知識。（八）組織考察團，為實地之科學調查與研究。（九）受公司機關之委託，研究及解决關於科學上之一切問題。　　看到上面所列的事業，本社的宗旨已不言可喻了。在民國七年的夏矢，本社總機關從美國移歸中國，設事務所於上海大同大學。同時南京設立一個支部，卽在南京高等師範學校一字房對面，一間小室的門口掛了一個牌子，裏面陳設了幾種雜誌，就算社員的會集所和支部的辦事處了。　　到得民國八年的十一月，我們居然向財政部領到南京成賢街文德里的官產做社所，一時大家高興得手忙脚亂。要維持新社所也要經費，於是又度那實行特別月捐的老法子。定設了四五年的圖書館籌備委員會，旣經有了房子，當然活動起來。社中推舉了胡剛復君做圖書館主任，一面向社員募集寄存書籍，一面籌劃一，些欵來購置新書。到了九年的八月，科學圖書館總算成立，但是簡陋得很，所以直到十一年一月才正式公開閱覽，那時也只有書籍五千餘冊，雜誌一千餘冊而已。　　一面進行糾織圖書館，同時也就發起籌備研究所，因為窮也有窮的幹法啦。照我們的原定計畫要辦五個研究所—理化，生物，衛生，礦冶和特別—及二個博物館—自然歷史和工商業品—各依性質，分設南京，上海，北平，廣州四地。因為生物最有地方性，且南京已有現存房屋，所以决定先辦生物研究所，希望所費較少而收效較快。那時社員中如秉志，胡先謵諸君都在東南大學敎書，就請他們二位計畫進行，並於課餘時間內分任動植物研究工作。到十一年八月十五日那天，就舉行了一個開幕典禮，這是中國私人團體設立研究所的鼻祖。當時經費艱難，設備上當然十分簡陋。直至次年，動植二部方才每月各得一百五十元經費，用來略備器械，採集標本。但是精神不錯，研究工作之外，更在樓下開辦陳列館，任人參觀，南京之有自然歷史博物館，實自此始。到民國十三年，動植二部以研究所得，發表論文五種，分送世界各專門學術機關，交換刋物，本社之研究事業遂開始為全世界學者所注意。　　上面是我追想本社成立的經通，和幾椿比較大一些的事業的創始情形。至於目前發展到如何程度，也得略述一下，不過先要樹一個標準來較量。民國五年，我們的社長任鴻雋君在第一次年會開幕的演說辭中，有如下的一段夢話：　　「科學的進步，不是做幾篇文章，說幾句空話，可以求來，是要在實習塲中苦工做出。諸君若以兄弟這話為不大錯，兄弟倒要請諸君做一個短夢看一看中國科學社未來的會所。這會所蓋在中國一個山水幽勝，交通便利的地方。外觀　不甚華麗，裏面却宏敞深富，恐怕比　在美國麻省工業學校新建的校舍不相上下。其中有圖書館，有博物館。其餘則分門別科，設了幾十個試騐室。請了許多本社最有學問的社員，照倍根的方法，在實騐室裏研究世界上科學家未經解决的問題。本社所出的期刋書、，不但為學校的參考書，且為各種科學研究的根據。由現在的中國科學社到我們想象的科學社須經幾多歲月，全看我們社員的熱力，興社會的效公心了。　　我們已做了二十年的一個長夢，究竟目前的成就去理想多遠，還得在夢裏檢閱一下。會所呢，只有在南京和上海的五六座房子，要比到麻省工校的校舍，未免小巫見大巫了。不過現在圖書館裏却也有三四萬册參考書，各國的科學期列，買來的和換來的，在三百種以上，百年以下，三四十年以上的全部舊雜誌也有好幾十部珍藏着。研究所僅僅有生物一門，一則沒有經費增添別種，二則國內的研究機關在這四五年問已如雨後春筍般的興起，我們也可以歇歇力。試騐室却也有十幾個，除動物和植物兩大部外，還有生物化學和生理學等幾個實騐室，當然裏面有許多很有學問的社員在應用倍根的方法。講到期刋方面，除了冷水和麵包爭出來的科學月刋沒有間斷過外，還有一種純通俗性質的科學書報半月刋。書籍方面，可以做學校麥考書的只有科學叢刋，科學業書和通論等幾種，而可供科學研究的根據的却不少。除每年年會中社員宣讀的論文外，生物研究所每年所發表的論文有三四十號。以這種論文興世界各國交換刋物的學術機關達七百多處，因此本社不但為國內重要研究機關之一，且久為國際學術界所器重了。關於出版方面，本社還創辦了一個中國科學圖書儀器公司，不但一切出版品都是自己印刷，且疋在努力編譯科學書籍和經營儀器標本的事業哩。　　除上面所述幾種事業之外，本社曾以最大的努力從事於審訂科學名詞。在科學發行之初卽經着手，自民國八年起卽參與中國科學名詞審查會，數學，物理，化學，生物各科名詞之擬定，多出本社社員之手，直到民國十八年，方才整理完成。關於科學敎育方面，除設有科學敎育委員會，從事調查中等學校科學上的設備和敎材書籍，以謀改良外，本社生物研究所並積極輔助中等學校理科敎員之研究工作，以增進其敎學上的能力，科學晝報中且特設理科敎材一欄，以供各中小學校之採用。本社並時時舉行公開演講，或供一般人聽講，或專供中學敎員聽講。自十九年起秉中央政府之意志，成立科學咨詢處，凡各界遇有科學上疑難問題來社咨詢者，卽由各一專家社員代為答復，每年達五六百件。還有一件事情可記的，就是參與國際科學會議。在中央研究院未成立以前，凡關於這類會議，國際間承認本社是中國的正式代表，例如十五年十一月第三次汎太平洋科學會議，十八年五月第四次汎太平洋科學會議等，都是由本社代表中國出席的。　　二十年來，我們不斷地受到政府社會所給予物質上和精神上的援助，或是基金，或是年費，或是特捐，或是獎勵，我們甚是感激。社員人數已達一千八百餘人，都是以發展科學為己任者？其中更不乏為社鞠躬盡瘁，終身以之的人。但是我們今日的成就，相去任先生夢境中的英國皇家學會，或美國斯密松學社還是很遠。處在這個科學競爭，弱肉强食的世界，我們中華民族如何能够自救危亡，如何能够躋登世界學術之林，我說到這裏，只有惶恐，海內外期望中國科學社的賢達君子，想也同此心理咧。中國科學社與二十年來之中國文化運動  盧于道　　中國科學社完全為中國習科學者自由集合之團體，其目的旣非政治的，亦非宗敎的，更非經濟的，完全是想以科學救垂危之祖國。自民國四年發起進行，以迄今年十月二十五日，已達到二十歲年齡。我們社員皆覺得在此二十年中雖未能如理想中所求之發展，但亦未曾虛度歲月。我們要使社內外友朋承認這句話起見，試將本社工作與二十年來之中國文化運動略加檢討。　　一·二十年來之新文化運動　　二十年前正是民國四年，辛亥革命已暫時告成，康梁新學已瀰滿全國。繼之而起者有新文化運動，如新中國，改造等新雜誌之刋行，其中最盛行而佔勢力者如新靑年，其主旨在提倡西洋化，政治要民主主義，學術要科學思想，其中並帶有白話運動，廢孔運動等，當然可說完全是因辛亥表面革命未能使中國立卽富强之反動。試看洪憲稱帝，章陸賣國，而引起孫中山先生再度革命及五四運動，卽可知。新靑年之中堅分子卽陳仲甫和胡適之，故他們的言論卽可代表當時思想中心。陳仲甫先生說：中要擁護那德先生（Democracy）便不得不反對孔敎，貞節，舊倫理，舊政治；要擁護那賽先生（Science）便不得不反對舊藝術，舊宗敎；要擁護德先生又要擁護賽先生便不得不反對國粹和舊文學，胡適之先生又說：我很不客氣的指摘我們的東方文明，很熱烈的頌揚西洋的近代文明。又說：我們如果還想把這個國家整頓起來，如果還希望這個民族在世界上佔一個地位，只有一條生路，就是我們自己要認錯，我們必須承認自己百事不如人；不但物質機械上不如人，不但政治制度不如人，並且道德不如人，文學不如人，音樂不如人，藝術不如人，身體不如人，可見當時最主要的工作是破壞，可惜其結果民主政治，旣未達到目標，科學思潮亦未普遍成功。　　從那之後，出版界熱鬧一番；哲學著作如胡適之中國哲學史大綱，梁漱溟，東西文化及其哲學；文學著作如創造社小說，在亦大學，周氏兄弟敎授之散文，以及社會思想之譯作，皆盛極一時，當時有許多作者比諸西洋之文藝復興。實際上中國仍未臻富强之閾，新文化亦仍未建樹成功。社會上——尤其是靑年學子——反而在道德思想上呈頹唐之象。近來之新生活運動及本位文化建設宣言，不能不承認是一種救時弊之反應　　二·科學中心的文化運動　　我們試細看上面所引陳胡二氏之文，其目標固在民主主義，科學以及西洋化，惜努力的方向，過偏于破壞方面。我們要在中國建樹新文化，第一要社會生活科學化，第二要學術思想科學化。故我名之曰科學中心的文化運動，此乃整頓祖國，復興民族之惟一生命綫。而近代西洋文明之特色，亦全在科學二字之中。信孔敎，守貞節，保留舊倫理，舊政治（指制度而言），舊藝術，舊宗敎，舊國粹，舊文學，全不碍事，只要有科學；卽不吃大菜，不穿西裝，不坐汽車，不住洋房，亦可以，只要有科學。只會坐火車而不知火車為科學之賜，只會洋化要講究衛生而不知衛生是科學道理，試問這種文化能否救中國？能否復興民族？　　我國經濟破產，就得要救濟農村，救濟農村之道在興水利，除害蟲，並健生產技術科學化。我國要减少入超，就得興工業，凡機器之製造，棉織之改良，皆非識量採用科學技術不為功。農工產物要流通，就得整理交通，如火車公路。因此技術人才機械材料就不得不盡量培植現供給。以至雪國恥，禦外侮，就不得不將全國軍隊軍人軍事科學化。凡此皆生活之科學化也。又如我國人口雖四萬萬多，而死亡疾病過多，智力過低，生命過短，體格過弱，不得不敎以攝生之道。凡浪漫，幽默，頹唐，苟安思想，均當以積極，有規則，保健等替代之。卽如達爾文進化論中之生存競爭學說，凡靑年均當熟知之，俾明瞭國家亦非競爭不能生存。凡此皆思想之科學化也。　　我相信社會上先知先覺之文化運動者，循此道以行，再二十年，中國未有不成為近代富强之國者。此道為何？一以貫之，科學而已！　　三，中國科學社二十年來之努力。　　在此二十年來文化運動中間，只埋頭幹去，未曾大吹大擂而實際上為文化建設之一線生命者，則有中國科學社之不斷努力。本社二十年來之工作，本報零有文載之，讀者可參閱：惟此種努力之意義，不能不說直至最近方受國內多數人之認識。要至言之，此種努力有兩方面：　　（一）普及科學　因為中國學術根本缺乏科學，因為中文化亦根本缺乏科學，因為中國國力亦根本缺乏科學，故不得不將科學方法及內容，就本社能力之所及，傳播到會中國各處。故首先有科學雜誌之刋行，所以載科學方面之論文。最近國感到中國大衆太缺乏科學知識，而科學月刋又未能及到，乃又刋行科學畫報。此二者最近推行日廣，為文者旣不在名，經營者亦非為利，完全盡科學救國的義務與責任，想本報及科學月刋讀者均能諒鑒此點。此為本社努力之一。　　（二）研究科學　然而科學日新月異，非辦圖書館興實騐室去研究，决不能追隨世界各先進國；尤其實騐室，因為科學研究，非閱書看報所能得來，必須直接去手作眼看接觸自然不可。本社以人力財力所限，先辦生物研究所於南京，在秉農山先生領導之下，已努力十餘年，其結果已與世界各國之生物學相頡頏。在國內則為首先創辦私立之完善研究所。此本社努力之二。　　中國文化之參以科學，乃為本社有系統並有力提倡之成功；本社雖非惟一功臣，亦為最努力之一分子。而國內之眞正科學研究工作，在生物方面，本社則頗自引為首倡者。此二者本社自認為中國文化運動中雖不揚而常存，雖不宣反常進者也。　　四，今後之奢望　　最後試略談我們的奢望，所望為何？即社會人士政府當局之認識與扶植是也。本社社員有的是智力，缺的是財力：本社長的是苦幹，短的是巧解。因此希望社會上人士及政府當局，時時把本社存在心中，除能源源接濟幹事所需之財源而外，又能時時記住以本社為良友，使本社一方面研究有成，他方面和社會之一角一隅皆能接觸得着，並發生關係，凡有機會卽給予之，凡有阻碍卽去除之，是豈本社之幸，亦中國科學之幸，中國文化之幸也！　　中國科學社第一次年會，民國五年九月二日在美國安陀阜城菲力柏學校舉行。  （民國四年攝）　　中國科學社第一届董事會，自左至右，前排趙元任周仁，後排秉志任鴻雋胡明復。中國科學社生物研究所</p>

<p>自由談嘉寶，伊伯湼茲，羅蘭斯  稜磨　　人通常是具有崇拜英雄的心理的，但同時也每具有破壞偶像的欲望。拉件最就手的事來講，揚秀瓊從五十米的自由泳的實座上跌下來，自然有許多人為他們的英雄的失敗惋惜，同時也就並非不在一部份人的望想之中。這其實還是一位佔據寳座未曾很久的英雄，大家對這偶像還沒有十分厭倦，至於被人崇拜得太久的偶像，其被厭倦往往超過其被崇拜，而一般人的破壞心理，隨時都會暴發。　　本來英雄的成為英雄，須經歷劇烈的動搖，經一次動搖而仍不失敗，其聲望才愈大。人言不足惜的態度，大槪每個英雄不免都有，而人言也往往都成為徒然的憎忿。這情形又是極普遍的，我們若取歷史的及當代的英雄作例，恐還不能儘量說得淸澈，但用其受崇拜與英雄相似的明星來旁證，那就很容易察出。在中國電影明星方面，也就有這種情形，但現在一般人對於中國明星，尙沒有什麼苛求，而明星中也沒有十分聲譽隆重的，至少還不曾過重到足以引起人的憎嫌。美國明星，在中國却有本國明星以上的勢力。因而其聲望所引起好惡，也至多懸異。蓋博爾恐怕就是現在聲譽極高，而又被很多人憎惡的一個。而享譽十年的嘉實，也有許多人對之起憎忿。　　婀那女郎一片的廣吿，戲院就爽當聲言，對嘉寳迷簡直無須介紹：但也有人說我們歡迎過壁克馥，歡迎過蓋諾，却沒有歡喜過嘉寳。就嘉寳傳中國竟有兩本看，嘉寳迷怕到底不是沒有的，所以復一說怕不過是企圖破偶像的一種策略。其所以有此企圖，一則是因嘉寳實在被說得太多了，再則是其所主演的繡幕一片又引起人的憎惡感情。　　因籌幕的未曾來到中國，不曾使嘉寳蹈上羅克的覆轍，普通觀衆大概不注意及嘉寳曾演過繡幕，而只覺得自克利斯丁娜皇后以來，巳和她闊別很久而愈覺婀娜女郞這片的珍奇。自然有人覺得這樣嘉寳太僥倖了，但實在僥倖的幷不僅嘉寳，至少繡幕的原作者毛罕該是史僥倖的。誠然毛罕在中國還不曾十分被注意，其聲望比他的同時前輩小說家所謂英國小說界的四騎士還相差甚遠，可是我們由「中國幕上的圖畫」這一書的斷片的翻譯，對他也是有相當熟悉的。這書且被曁南大學採為英文課本，他的地位會逐漸上升吧。因「中國幕上」書中對西洋人的譏嘲，比對中國的譏嘲更為嚴重，他的地位或將終不因他的為繡幕的作者而受何影響。　　一國的特殊風習，在外國作家筆下寫成離奇可笑，大概幷非希有之事，受到這種痛創的，自然不僅我們，我們所受到的痛創，有時固全出於作者的惡意，但有地位的作家如毛罕，當幷不是這類惡意。上流的作家的心理，大概不至如此卑劣。若非因特殊的忿激，像伊卜涅茲那樣儘力用小說攻擊德國的情形是不大有的。　　我不否認嘉寳在我心中佔有一點地位，這地位就是伊卜湼茲給她的。我看過在美國主演的第一張片子似水流年，這片的故事的原作者就是伊卜涅茲，伊卜涅茲那時剛得了諾貝爾獎金不久，就在中國也算是個流行作家，大概是他原作把我吸引了去。或者還另外有點原因，就是由伊卜湼茲原作四騎士改編的電影兒女英雄旣鬨動一時，他的我們的海，我又剛看過而獲得很好的印象。在去看時，决不想到會在似水流年裏發現嘉寳，而嘉寳竟會在伊卜湼茲巳差不多被人遺忘之後，更存在人的心上。　　雖然我們的海一片還淸晰留在我的記憶裏，而且不久前還又讀一遍這書的譯本，但對於這我們的海的心情，可大有點兩樣。我甚至疑惑或者伊卜涅茲不死，也許會失悔寫這本書的。這心情的改變的原因，自然很複雜，有一點怕是在我們的海那張舊影片上，覆上了一張傾國傾城這新影片。　　嘉寶所演的神秘女郞一片的情調，與我們的海還是相近的，使瑪琳黛德麗成名的忠節難全，就有點異穌，傾國傾城的故事雖和上兩片不相似，但也會使人把他們關連起來。三個女主以為黛德麗的技術比嘉寶高十倍，而柯爾伯現在也頗有壓倒嘉寶之勢，但就這兩人的作風是模倣嘉寳的話，到底很近事實，因為單純的連想，就能給我們以一證明。除這演技相近之外，另外的關速處則是我們的海中的海與傾國傾城中的海是同一個海。　　歷史與文化叢書中的名著之一，有呌做「埃及與第一帝國」的一本埃及的統治，固完成帝國的偉大，但也就是帝國衰亡的癥結。以後這樣的故事，又累次重演，直到近代，拿破崙的征服埃及猶為其失敗的遠因。但歐洲列强，迄現在也不忘呑服這顆炸彈。見他在別人的腹中時，是時時計算着他將在何時爆裂的，但同時却固信自己的肚皮，會異常堅實。　　或者現在吞着這顆炸彈者的肚皮的堅實程度，確巳到了可嫉妬的地步了，這優勢是喊着我們的海的人所不能忘的。這種嫉妬的感情，大概歐戰結束後不久就有，曾在意大利居過很久的羅蘭斯，在其游記「海及撒丁島」就記述了不少。而羅蘭期對於意大利人的描寫，也很帶一點譏嘲。他所寫羅馬車站上管票時擁擠的情形，讀了可使人覺得全運會票櫃前的擁擠毫不足怪。這類微末的事件，在本國倒是幷不諱言的，但在外國人筆下寫出來，就不免感到損傷了。其實羅蘭斯是很歡喜意大利文明的人，幷不至於以自己的理想之境的幻滅為幸的。長衫  禾金　　小的時候，從長輩那兒，我是甚受取了那麼一種敎育的：「讀書人家的子弟，出外見人要裝得規規矩矩，至少，一件長衫是必須要穿好的！」於是，從這時候起，我便開始給安排在長衫的圈套裏了，連氣都透不出來。　　二十幾年來，自己時常為了自己的年靑而驕傲着：說話喜歡帶一點浮而不實的「嘈弄」，以顯得自己的小聰明；而每一個回答則不知放進了多少絕對肯定的字眼，算是某種毅力的表示！這些是通常被年老的一代用作指摘「小孩子們」的口實的。這其間，二十年前的，甚至十年前的，過去的陳舊的暗影，雖然在當時是全顯得十分有力，十分動人的，可是到現在，在我底腦子裏，有的是漸漸地褪去了鮮艷的顏色，有的則居然被自己用了人力來硬生生地否定了。祖父放在鐵盒子裏的「祖傳的」紅頂花翎，在當時是被視為拱璧而後來却低用價賣到了舊貨担子上去的，與父親的常常用夾誇耀的「買辦」的「服務證書」，在現在看來，是顯得多麼可憎啊：然而舊的東西，並沒有賣到舊貨担子上去，而依舊遺留到我們一代的身上的，却有一樣，而且是很大的一樣——　　「出門見人，必須穿長杉啊—讀書人，是應該放得規規矩矩的。」　　我讀了書，我「出門見人」也穿長衫。　　過去的一個秋天，在一處閙街的小學校裏敎書——所謂閙街，是在附近有工廠店舖，與店員工人等的住家的；那些住家們，每個學期化了六七塊錢，把他們底小孩子送到學校裏來讀書識字，而他們自己則依然存着那麼一個想頭：要是自己的孩子將來做一個「讀書人「，那是頂好頂好的了。　　可是設立在弄堂裏的小學校沒有「大」的氣派，學生們常常從早晨掃地買菜之後拖着一個老不高興的小身體來上課，身上是穿得亂七八糟的；一個敎室裏沒有三個人穿長衫，到熱天，甚至有穿了一件黑而破的「汗衫」到學校裏來的。　　小學校裏的「校長」，可看不得那樣的情形，為了「有碍觀瞻」，硬要學生們穿了長衫來上課堂；於是吿訴我：「以後如果有不穿長衫的，呌他出敎室去！一　　可是有什麼用呢，一天一天的上課，依舊是那種與「小紳士們」兩樣的「不討歡喜」的短衣服啊，亂七八糟的，像流民團。　　於是也責打過了，也硬敎他們走出敎室了。　　可是以後，有的家族自己帶了他們的孩子來說：「沒有長衫啊」，「要做工，做工是不能穿長衫的啊」……　　往後，我再也不想帮着校長去「整飭觀瞻」了，不但因為那是多事，也因為那是一種犯罪與惡德。如果冉把比我們更年靑的一輩，從生活中拉來套在長衫裏，這個責任是應該我們來担承的了！沒有人知道（三）  休伍·安特生作何為譯　　這年經人開始神經質地大笑起來。「天很熱，」他說。他想用手去觸她。「我不很勇敢，」他私自想道。他想能够碰一碰她那油汚的柳條布衣服的摺皺，一定是種無比的快樂。她開始很曖昧地說起話來：「你以為你一定是好過我的。這無須你說，我也知道。」她說着，更靠近他一步。　　喬治·韋拉特忽然滔滔不絕地說起話來。他記起他們在街上遇到時的她的眼色，想起她寫給他的那張條子。他不再猶豫了。閙得滿城風雨的關於她的閒話，使他得到了自信。他變成一個完完全全的男子漢，勇敢而且積極。但在他的心里。却是沒有一點同情的。「啊，我們走吧。沒沒有人會知道的。他們怎麼知道呢？」他極力慫患着。　　他們向着一條狹窄的，磚鋪的側道走去。一些高大的野草，生長在側道的裂縫中間。有些磚頭巳經不見了，所以側道是又粗糙又不規則。他挽着她那同樣粗糙的手，却以為那是小得非常可愛。「我不能再走遠了」。她說道，聲音是平靜而且舒服的。　　他們走過一座橫在一條小河上的小橋以後，又行經另一塊上面長着稻子的荒地。街道到此盡頭了。在大路旁邊的小徑上，他們不得不先後地走着。威爾，奧伏頓的咖啡田就在大路左近，在那兒堆着一大堆木板。「威爾想在這兒造一座藏放咖啡簍的小屋。」喬治說着。他們　一道坐在那一堆木板上面。　　喬治·韋拉特回到大街巳是十點多鐘了，天下起雨來。他沿着大街走來走去的走了三次。雪爾佛斯脫·韋斯脫的藥店還是開着，因此他跑進去買了一盒雪茄。那個名呌囂特·克倫特爾的夥計陪着他一同走出店門，使他很感到快活。這兩個人站在藥店前面的布篷下面竟有五分鐘之久，他們互相談着話。喬治·韋拉特感到滿意。他只想向無論什麼人談天。他抹了一個灣，溫柔地吹着唿哨，向韋拉特新旅社走去。　　在溫奈廣貨舖附近的人行道上，豎着一道滿是馬戲廣告畫的板牆。他在那兒停止唿哨了，却木立在黑暗中間，很注意地聽着，彷彿有人呼喚着他的名字。於是他又神經質地大笑起來。「她並沒有從我這里得到什麼，沒有人會知道的。」他反覆地喃喃自語，繼續地走着。（完）島上小札  荒煤　　我底好友：　　三兩天，我又將負起霉了的行囊邁上遙遠的旅途了，我想我應該給封信你。　　我實在不知要說些什麼好，在這裏雖住了一個短短的期間，我是早巳膩煩了；這裏什麼都沒有我留戀的，就說海吧，葦，我也會不高興地吿訴你，海也是死的！　　為了我將走，在昨天晚上，我曾獨自云悄悄地望了海；逢着沒有月亮的夜，星星也稀零得可憐，沒有風，海睡熟了，但它在夢中低聲嗚咽，陣陣的　　我爬上一塊高大的崖石，用濕潤的眼睛向平靜的海面凝視，心頭充滿了一些說不出的憎惡；有一股海腥氣漫騰了上來，使我底呼吸感到了窒塞；我止不住想呼嘯。但我嘗試過，我知道在這曠漠的海濱被呼嘯所引起的孤寂之感反會壓倒了我，我沒有那樣做。可是我憤恨，我終於還是詛咒了它，我向它說：你也是死的！　　海確實也是死的，你不要預備和我辯，我想當你見了它時，久久，你也會相信的：它是死的！我試過多少次，簡直用脚去踐踏它，企圖激起它底呼嘯來，但它祇是可恥地嗚咽，有時它却還笑了。　　當然，海有時也會昂起頭來猛撲着礁石，把自己在上面摔得粉碎，並且不斷地狂嘯，驚得海燕都飛了的；可是當你再見它平靜時，那是會令你都替它感到羞恥的啊：它那麼馴服地躺着，讓羣羣海燕得意地飛翔在它底臉上，甚至啄它底臉，但它，它祇是可恥地鳴咽。為什麼它不永遠呼嘯呢？……　　因為這樣，海也是死的，我將毫無留戀地遠去。還有什麼是能呌我留戀的呢？　　為了病而期望安寗，我把夢中都負着慾苦的疲乏的身子悄悄地拖了來，但我沒有得着安寗，雖然我也年靑，這裏美麗而幽靜，有可愛的不知名的野花，有白楊銀杏和槐樹夾道的小山，有海……但我沒有得着安寗，我孤苦。　　每天黃昏，就有些淡漠的悲哀襲進我底心，使我無端地憂鬱起來。夜色漸漸深，這憂鬱也就漸漸濃厚得如一團可以感覺得到的東西了！真的，我常常是呼吸着而苦惱地沉醉了。　　是畏懼夜之襲來麼……　　這時候，我厭倦一切，但我獨愛墨闇、一到了夜裏，我常常跑到海濱的沙灘上伏着，去望那茫茫的看不見邊際的海；五月的溫暖的風帶來一陣強烈的海腥，使我底悲慘的記憶立即來苦惱我：在記憶中，甚至比海腥還令我窒息的，那是一股什麼樣的血腥啊！也有時，我也常常把自已關在一間小屋裏，不點燈，靜靜地躺着，睜大眼睛望着黑暗——是可以望得見的麼？——我焦灼而不安，像是失去了什麼，而在惘惘地尋找。尋找些什麼呢？無論黑暗是多麼深，即使我緊緊地閉住了眼，我也會看見一些蒼白的肉和鮮紅的血……唉，又是在什麼遙遠的記憶中的呢？　　我底好友！我還是那麼愛搜尋記憶，雖然這使我非常的苦惱。　　誰都說，記憶是不死的。但我覺得有些記憶不已經是異常飄渺麼？許也就是因為這穌，才更苦苦地去搜尋它吧？　　在記憶中，不知別人是不是這穌，我感到最晰的，是人底眼晴。在黑暗里，我甚至看見那些眼晴在發亮——露出了各穌的感情。它們都那麼冷。我要肯定地向你說：這不是錯覺！　　因為我相信，於是各樣的眼睛，往往使我心慄了，，它們這視着我，那麼冷——就是有一雙充滿了柔情的明麗的大眼，也是那麼冷啊。我還要肯定地說：這不是錯覺！葦，那麼些冷的眼睛不是叫我全身都起了寒慄麼？　　我害怕，我於是起來點了燈，但我心頭充滿了悲哀，弱小的燈光照着我，祇有一個慘淡的孤影，這使我感到了祇獨。我不能不又吹熄了燈去躱在黑闇中，但那些冷的眼睛望着我殘酷地笑了；這穌，我是止不住像孩子般不知羞地哭了。　　泣着，有時我也曾疲乏地睡熟過去。但夢噩中，我常又是泣着驚醒了過來。怎麼泣，夢一醒就逝去了，記不得是為了什麼。可是，一陣悲哀壓倒了我，逢着風雨的夜裏，聽見遠處的海嘯，有着明麗的月夜，看見蒼白的月色，我底心像被什麼攫去了似的，又開始感到空虛和迷惘了。　　不少的朋友望我安寗，能够使不茁壯的身子强一點，但我怎麼吿訴他們呢？我不需要安寗，不，我不能安寗，我孤苦……。　　像這樣，我為什麼還要留在此地呢？　　哦，牧還應該吿訴你，在這里，我確曾做過了一些年靑的夢，為了它，我也曾沉醉過一時，我也曾獨自天眞地發過微笑……然而，葦，雖說我年靑，我却並不是那麼適宜做夢的人；夢還沒醒，我却早巳憤怒地感到我底靈魂——我底一切——在那悲慘的命運裏被禁錮之深了！但讓這些夢留在此地吧，它年靑，而此地是這樣的美麗。　　也許為了這些夢，我還會在將來懷念這里吧？不過，我還相信自己不甘被夢迷亂的。那麼，我還要說些什麼呢？　　去，我將毫無些微留戀地還去，永遠地去了！　　還有什麼足能呌我留戀的呢？海也是死的。……錢塘江畔  李三郞　　登上了十三層的古塔，　　殘凋的影子到處地擦過眼眶。　　可是，他還是那麼高傲，　　在錢塘江畔，　　在月輪山的巔上。　　這兒可以憑眺白帶似的江流，　　秋風在掠着江畔的雜草，　　秋風在吹着塔邊的林梢。　　輕微的——沙沙，郞郞。　　幽淸的濤聲在空間週塲。　　然而，錢塘江為什麼這樣沉默了？　　為什麼不煽起了，　　那偉大無私的風浪，　　把這頹唐了的古塔洗盪了，　　別讓牠還顯出古宿的高傲呢！</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言談工業出險  約楡　　據工部局報告：九月份公共租界各工廠，共發生意外事端一百九十八件，其中死者八人，女子受傷者共十人。至男子受傷者若干，它雖不願意明白告人，可是一經計算，在該報告可以算得出的有一百五十餘人之多。假使連法租界和華界的工廠一起計算起來，受傷者假定它五百人，因傷致死者又假定為四十人，想總不致冤枉了事實吧。倘照此類推，一年就有六千傷者：以每人一家三口計算，因這六千傷者的不能工作，就影響到近二萬人的生活了（誰也知道中國目前是沒有勞働保險法的）這是何等駭人聽聞的事啊！　　自去年接一連二的鍋爐爆炸慘案發生後，我們以為當局對於工廠檢查的實施，定獲相當效果，不料，畫餅充飢，致此類事件仍層出不窮，良深扼腕！　　本來中國民族工業的技術落後，資本薄弱；在國際資本壓迫之下，更受不景氣，外貨傾銷的打擊；奄奄一息，支持已覺不易，那有餘力對於技術，設備的改良？其出境之難，不言可喩。然而直接受罪的還是工人。雖然在國內有不少外人資本的工業，可是在普遍失業恐慌的現社會，特別在農村破產的中國產業後備軍的激增超過任何國家之上：那末，聰明的外國資本家决不願以較多的工資嘉惠中國工人，或稍費利潤以顧及工人的安全的。所以無論在中外資本工廠做工的工人，同樣的在毫無保障的環境裏出賣其勞力甚至送掉其生命。　　支持全人類社會生存的重任是擱在工人的肩上，然而工人的生命是這樣地被人浪費，這不祗是某一部份人的損失，實是全人類的不幸！尤其是生產衰退，技術落後的中國，只見「增加生產」的呼聲，而對於生產勞働者工作的安全，生活的改善等却無人注意，殊令人不解！為要達到真正能夠「增加生產以增厚國力」起見，希望國人對此不幸的事件應予注意，並亟謀補救纔好。南浦之夜  天　　秋深了，秋的紫羅蘭青綃罩在落木蕭蕭的北山上，貼在青錢疊疊的南塘中，一顆把寂寞當成歡喜的心，開始作　秋夜的探險了。　　曵着兒時同騎竹馬，現在合　生活的瑾，跨上一葦小舟，在一泓碧綠的南浦里泛起夜棹來。　　一隻　槳翻出銀箭似的浪花，　濕了瑾的單衣，也濺濕了吻水的荷衣，月兒粉身在瑾衣之上，也粉身在荷衣之上。　　「秋深了啊！—寒意涔涔地呢！」　　她用力棹破了池水的恬靜，池水立時奔忙起來，從船邊蕩到吻水的荷衣裏層去。舟身馳入聳立的珠簾畫棟的荷殿深處，清脆聲與蘭槳的欵乃混成一片，幽香和燥味幾乎窒住了鼻息，我伸手攀住一枝殘落了花瓣的蒂蓮，牠那充滿了生命之力的青春，仿佛溢出了堅而且軟的輪廓外，咚！我連蒂的把她摘下來了。　　「人便是這樣殘忍的喲！」瑾感歎着。　　「她生命本是短促，要不，聽其她自然地生滅，那又是何等地寂寞啊！」我漫應着。　　我一層一層剝除她的綠衣，衣是那麼脆弱的，白皙而肥嫩的身軀，便像一粒橢圓形的珠子，隨着便送往嘴裏去了，一粒一粒地只知道我口舌的清甜的快樂，不知她的切膚的痛苦。　　瑾又說了，是那麼流利的滔滔的：　　「人總是利己的，他只知珍愛自己的生命，便不惜犧牲其他的生命，猜忌，憎惡，殘殺，爭奪，便都從這里產生啦！」她一槳衝出了荷殿。　　月亮伴着小舟躺在碧天之上，瑾便像荷蓮那麼脆弱附着雙槳欹在船舷上了，她假寐着，像在懺悔她的什麽罪愆，替我祝福，用沉默的心靈來澄清這略帶凄清的秋夜，凄清的蓮塘。　　魚在沉靜的潭水裏冶遊，鱗片般的波紋，隨着牠的翻騰粼粼馳湧開去，牠</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>也迂緩地排到舟邊，但一聆到人的呼吸，便一步走遠了，水的回聲，縱舟邊悠悠的發出來。　　「人果眞是殘暴的嗎？」我感喟地驚異。　　一點螢火，從里黝黝的森林那邊飛來，珊珊地又停在我們的船舷上，在瑾的惺忪的眼睛裏瀉出這一綫光明，他又高興，可憐惜的想撲過去，所是牠又溜跑了，空自喘氣地道：　　「難道」綫光明也留不住嗎？啊！光明，」　　「今夜的秋，沒有悲哀，今夜的你，倒有這些怨哀！」拂着她絲絲的青髪，髪上有點潮……　　一個多愁善感的她，竟有一顆追求光明的心！誰理解她，便是號稱最理解她的我，也慒然地對着她奇怪。　　而她已有着初期的肺結核了，她似乎對眼前的一切都有遭逢不再之感。於是用着娓婉的歌喉唱出一首古詩：　　「春水遙碧，春水綠波，送君南浦傷如之何！」　　「過時了啦！」我坐下來，用炯炯的目光對着他。　　「我們都是過了時的人物啊！可記起三年前的黃鶴樓頭之夜，那才是我們的時候！」　　這種類似掃興的話我不能耐，便提議回去，但她把雙獎探入了水心，尚有點階別之威。……　　在去年的落花時節，那兒時同騎竹馬，現在合卺生活的瑾便離我而去了，從此南浦之秋夜不再有我和她蕩舟的痕跡，而她所遺給我的，也只有一顆追求光明的心！天啊！我將永恒地保存着！夜  璜　　屋外躺濕着一片霜白光。瀰在屋頂的樹影，已偷偷地溜下屋簷，爬到窗櫺上來了，窗櫺上的樹影亦爬到牆根來，原先生牆根的，亦越過了灰白的走道，落在那些小小的菜葉上。是深夜的時分了，月亮兒已西斜。　　屋頂的枯葉隨着風輕輕飄下來，打了幾個回旋，無力地落在地上，發出了一絲低低的低低的聲息，是它的末日實嘆息呵。　　我打開房門一陣原野送過來的帶着土的氣味的風，立刻拂着我的臉。月亮的良光亦像水一樣瀉進我的房里來，微風撫弄着垂下的昏黃的帳，它微微地動着，似乎感到夜的寒意。　　我在庭中站住，仰頭望望天上那稀疏的星星。它們在閃眼，用着冷淡得，深沉得像一個智慧的哲人一樣的眼睛凝視着我。我亦痴痴地注視着它們，像見到了一個久別了的愛友一樣。是的，我許久沒有機會，亦沒有心情同它們交換着神秘的話語。但今夜這偶然的機會，使我又得同它聚頭了。　　星星是我熟悉的，它使我記起許多已忘久了的，被人世的灰塵封蔽了的事情。他又似乎使我看見那個可親的人的臉，那個柔和的，在遙遠的天那邊（亦許她這時侯亦着着我吧）的人的臉。一切可親的人們，一切的難忘的往事在這時候就一齊湧上心頭來了，這星星閉眼的靜夜。　　我想着：亦是一個月夜，一個天上的星星用着智慧的而又多情的向我注視的夜，我同她二個人，在某大城的郊外，默默地撫着那座剛豎立不久的靑色的石碑。我又想着；亦是一個月夜，一個天上的星星用着智慧的而又多情的眼向我注視的夜，我同着那個躺在小土堆里的人一齊走下山坡，興奮地而又快活地壁談壁走着，一同許工後約，作一個不負此生的人。而現在他已安眠了，在某大城的西郊之外；而她呢？却遠在天那邊，嚥着淚過着不自由的生活……　　亦許這時侯，多情的月亮正照着那剝落的石碑，深秋的落葉，以無力的身推着他那蔓生着野草的墓門吧。在那里埋着一個腐爛了的軀體，可是却有看一顆溫熱的而又躍動的心的人。　　「已經三年了。」我想着，「已經三年了，這三年來我怎樣了呢？」我怯懦地問我自己。　　我仰望着星星，可是星星却冷淡地凝視着我。他似乎譏笑，我的怯儒同退縮。「對不住自己，要對不住朋友呵，這樣的生活。」我慚愧而又悔悵起來了。　　等到我從默想里轉過身來時，夜露已沽濕了我的外衣了。夜還是那樣靜寂，投在窗櫺的樹影已落在那些小小的菜葉上了。軌道上  梁啟筠　　九月的柔軟的陽光底下，原野靜靜地躺着。撫媚的秋風扭動蛇一樣的肢體，跨過了鐵軌，把楓樹的輕微的太息，傳遞給那倚着城脚的織弱的小河。於是，河水也嗚咽着了。　　那邊，沿着鐵軌一直伸展開去，在視力的盡頭處，佇立着淡淡的暗紫色的山影。它的魁梧的軀幹，表現出它的驕傲，莊嚴，和一種大無畏的神情。山影背後，是一片玉藍帶點灰茫的天幕；山脚下，冒起一縷一縷的輕烟，裊裊的，輕盈的，微微地顫抖着的姿態，流露着一種憂鬰的氛氤。　　一個三十歲模樣的鄉民，吃力地拖着為陽光壓為了的瘦影，慢慢兒從原野踱到軌道旁邊。他，抬起一支烏黑的手，擱在眼眉上，蹬起脚踵向遠方眺望着。——　　鐡軌像兩條死蛇？蜿蜓地躺着，毫無一點生氣。中間有一段隱沒在樹林的陰影里，從稀疏的樹林的校枼的罅隙間，可以隱約瞧見威格萊車站，那車站的之屋頂，映着嬌柔的秋陽，猙笑着一張橘子皮似的笑臉。　　這樣他便在枕木上坐了下來，伸了個懶腰，搓搓雙烏泥手，楞住眼珠子凝望着天空。——看樣子，好像是個宗敎膜拜者，冀望上帝的仁慈的賜惠，而正在等待一個偉大的不可思議的命運降臨似的。　　漸漸兒，在坐了一個很短暫時的時問之後，汽笛聲也隨着柔媚的九月的軟風送過來。於是，「隆隆」的車輪與鐵執相舐觸而發出的轔轆聲也聽得啦。他站起身，拍拍那件破舊的軍服，頓時抖擻起精神來。　　一列貨列車由遠而近了。　　機關車挺着壯大的胸脯，喘着氣，打他的身邊竄過。接連在後面的是一長串的車輛，蓬車，敞車，軍車，牲畜車，……　　他做了一個敏捷的姿勢，抓住一輛洞開車門的空篷車的門楞，便跳將上去　　可是，一不留神，一隻手滑脫了。　　「喲，救——！」　　在一陣心慌意亂的無效果的掙扎之後，人也隨着墮下去。　　驀地，起了一聲直鑽進雲層里的慘叫！　　守車里的車長，打小而方的窗子探出腦袋，哎的狂喊了一聲，縮做一團地在打着戰兒。……　　列車的喧囂噪鬧又給沈寂吞沒了。只遺留下一個微弱的怖人的呻吟。　　原野是空曠的。沒有人烟的地方哪　　一秒鐘，一分鐘，……呻吟繼續了一個多時辰。　　直至後來給一個路警發覺時，人已經是僅存一息了。　　於是，便開始了一個極大的紛亂的騷擾。……　　站長辦公室里，助理員小鬍子燃着了一支雪茄烟，把一個瞥視投在寫字檯上的公務電報的草稿上面，捻捻小鬍子，冷笑地說：……　　「該死的東西哪！」錢塘江畔  艾荼　　跟着錢塘江向東跑着的時候，可以看見那在叢林的高山上的紅綠的洋房子，那兒是「之江大學」的校舍，背着高峯，面臨着飄沸着的浙江。這兒的周圍都是葱翠的山峯，不禁令我煽起的羨慕的心情，在這兒讀書的哥兒們多麼幸福的呀。然而，我只是瞪着眼珠子來望牠的煌耀，我不能跨進門檻的一步。　　迎面吹來的潮水的風，輕輕地，那太陽照耀着的光彩，反映出來的波水的白茫。可惜這時沒有什麼潮浪，不然，更可以顯出秋濤的美麗來。這時，可以聽到一點一點的沙沙——郎郎——的濤聲，秋風吹着岸邊的樹梢間透出來的哨聲混和着。幽幽的，像音樂的感傷的調子。　　我向着高昂地在月輸山頂的六和塔跑着。六和塔是臨着廣闊的錢塘江，我以為，錢塘江最好的風景莫如登上六和塔的下三層塔頂來觀望秋洔。雖然現在已深秋了，沒有潮濤的美觀了。可是，只要你登上塔頂，什麼囂煩與悒鬱，就會無影子的消滅了。　　我從沒有看通這樣的巨塔，雖然牠已顯現出了老年的殘凋的氣息！到處已有着創傷。可是，他還有着古典式的雄麗，有着歷史上的遺蹟，這，總不會令人家有多大的失望吧。　　我登進塔內，塔內是一座樓厦一樣的闊大，空暢，不過牆壁上已刻上了許多不規則的花紋，——是殘凋的晚年的氣息了。繞着螺形的梯級上去，一層又一層的增高，同時，自己的心靈也一陣一陣的飄渺，感動，眼珠子也一陣比一陣的愉快了起來的。在最頂的一層，我憑倚着柱邊，眺望着遠遠的江流。　　遠遠的江流就好一條白帶似的展開，成了一個「之」字形的，不錯，這兒是叫做「之江」的。也確是很眞切的。江流長長地蜿蜒地展開去，那一邊江邊上都是一片荒蕪似的平原，這麼，正在建築着鐵權的時候，所以，除了江水的嘩啦嘩啦的聲音以外，我還可以聽到一陣一</p>

<h3>French Premier Informs British Ambassador: Mussolini's Armistice Conditions - Establishment of Concessions in Abyssinia - Abyssinian Emperor's Territory Must Reduce Armaments - Italian Libya to Withdraw a Division</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to the Parisian evening newspaper, French Premier Laval today informed the British Ambassador to Paris, Sir Eric Phipps, of Mussolini's proposed armistice conditions. It is reported that the content includes the establishment of concessions in Abyssinia following the Chinese model in several locations, reducing the armed Italian forces stationed in Abyssinia to a certain number to act as police, and demanding the reduction of armaments within the territory where the Abyssinian Emperor still enjoys sovereignty. This would mean Abyssinia would only be allowed to maintain a standing army, and all Abyssinians not in the standing army would be forbidden from carrying weapons. It is also reported that Italy is prepared to respect the League of Nations' duties in principle, using the Five-Power Committee's report as the basis for negotiations. After negotiations begin, the committee or the executive council will complete the handling of these negotiations. The proposed administrative system for Abyssinia by Italy is different from the mandated trusteeship described in the League of Nations Covenant. As Abyssinia is a member of the League of Nations, difficulties will arise if Articles 22 and 22 of the Covenant are invoked for Abyssinia; hence the suggestion of adopting a concession system. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) In recent months, Anglo-Italian relations have been strained to the breaking point. Now, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has withdrawn one of the three Italian divisions stationed in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, thus improving relations between the two countries. According to a statement issued by the British Foreign Office today, the Italian government has informed Britain that it has ordered the withdrawal of four infantry regiments, a total of 8,000 men, stationed in Libya on the Egyptian border. However, troops will still be stationed there. It is reported that the Italian government took this action due to the moderate tone of British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons on Tuesday and the assurances made by British Ambassador to Rome Drummond to Mussolini. How Britain will respond to Italy has not yet been decided, as Italy still has two divisions stationed in Libya. Italy's withdrawal of troops was not accompanied by any conditions, nor did it ask Britain to reciprocate. The news of Italy's order to withdraw troops has been immediately notified to French Premier Laval, who is still working to clear the air. Diplomatic talks to resolve the Abyssinian issue are still ongoing, but Rome is cautiously optimistic. According to Italian official sources, these talks have not yet produced concrete results regarding the Abyssinian dispute. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources here stated today that although the Italian government has informed Britain that it has ordered the withdrawal of one division of troops stationed in Libya, it has not asked the British government to take similar action. According to opinions here, Italy's action is welcome, but must not be regarded as a condition. British officials have made it clear that Britain has no intention of changing the disposition of its Mediterranean fleet. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) It is speculated here that the Italian division withdrawn from Libya has now been transferred to Tripoli. Well-informed sources say that this is purely a voluntary act by Italy, welcomed by Britain, but there are no plans to reduce the British Navy in the Mediterranean at present. (National News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, Premier and Foreign Minister Laval, in a report to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies on the government's foreign policy, stated that after the Stresa Conference, he had informed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that French policy was based on the League of Nations Covenant, and that if Italy violated the Covenant, France would be forced to impose economic sanctions on Italy. Laval also declared that France would always uphold the League of Nations and seek a peaceful solution to the Italian-Abyssinian issue within the League of Nations framework. He also stated that he had received reports that Mussolini was now prepared to withdraw one of the three divisions of troops stationed in Italian Cyrenaica, Africa. When the Foreign Affairs Committee questioned Laval on the interpretation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, Laval replied that if any member of the League of Nations suffered retaliation from an aggressor country for implementing sanctions, all countries should assist each other. After the Foreign Affairs Committee adjourned, it issued a communiqué stating that France would faithfully fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant and would implement Anglo-French cooperation in a spirit of complete friendship under the guidance of Geneva. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Small Entente Countries Implement Sanctions Against Italy - Germany's Attitude Not Yet Expressed</p>
<p>(Geneva) The three Small Entente countries of Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia today informed the League of Nations that they have implemented the two types of sanctions against Italy agreed upon in Geneva: (1) prohibiting the transport of arms and other war materials to Italy, and (2) severing financial relations. There are now a total of twenty-five countries prohibiting the transport of arms to Italy, and five countries severing financial relations with Italy. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government has recently received a memorandum from the League of Nations regarding the implementation of sanctions against Italy. The official response of the German government is not yet known. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Laval has recently met with the Portuguese Minister to France, Vasco Gonsalves, Chairman of the Sanctions Committee of the League of Nations Assembly, for discussions. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Continues Debate on Foreign Affairs - Different Circumstances of the Sino-Japanese Issue</h3>
<p>(London) Today was the second day of the House of Commons debate on foreign affairs. Many speakers pointed out that the League of Nations did nothing during the Sino-Japanese dispute, but has been very active in the Italian-Abyssinian conflict. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden responded by saying that these two matters cannot be compared and should not be forcibly compared. The League of Nations did not declare Japan to be an aggressor, and the Sino-Japanese dispute never resulted in either side engaging in war. China did not sever diplomatic relations with Japan, nor did it invoke Article 16 of the Covenant, which stipulates sanctions. Furthermore, there are practical considerations; the two major powers on either side of the Pacific are not members of the League of Nations, so the necessary conditions for collective action do not exist. Lloyd George spoke before Eden, saying that the Foreign Secretary had not mentioned several very important events: "Can the contents of the Franco-Italian agreement in January and the Stresa Conference be revealed? From January to September, France supplied Italy with 478 tons of distilled coal tar, a highly explosive substance, and 697 tons of glycerin needed for cannons. There have certainly been developments in the past few days. Has Britain agreed to withdraw part of its Mediterranean fleet?" Eden replied, "I have nothing to hide. All negotiations in Geneva are recorded in the report of the Geneva Committee under Article 16 of the Covenant. As for the claim that Britain is responsible for compensating other countries' losses, it must be understood that what we are responsible for is what is stipulated in the Covenant." Eden then detailed the diplomatic activities since December, hoping to refute the charge that the British government was slow to act. Eden mentioned the negotiations between January and March, including one occasion when he personally negotiated with Mussolini, and said that Italy had sincerely stated at the end of March that it was willing to proceed with negotiations as soon as possible and was eager to implement the Geneva principles in a moderate spirit. Eden recounted past events up to the point when he took a peace proposal to Rome. Eden said that this trip was ineffective, as were several previous trips. Britain's efforts to seek a basis for negotiation ultimately failed, which is regrettable. Negotiations dragged on for a long time, and each negotiation ended in failure because Italy was unwilling to accept even a basis for discussion.</p>
<p>Eden replied, "We have said it again and again. Does Mr. George find it strange? If you read Italian newspapers, you will not find it strange. Anyone who participates in an unpleasant debate cannot be happy about this work, but has a responsibility and must fulfill it." (The audience applauded.)</p>
<p>The first speaker today was Prime Minister Baldwin, who began by announcing that the next general election would be held on November 14. The new Parliament will convene on November 26 to elect a speaker, and the King will visit the House on December 3 for the formal opening of Parliament.</p>
<p>Baldwin then spoke on foreign affairs, explaining that the Foreign Secretary's remarks yesterday were endorsed by the Cabinet, and that Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden's actions in Geneva had the unanimous approval of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>Baldwin continued emphatically, "We have no intention of acting alone or going beyond what we can get the entire League of Nations to do. The word 'war' has never been in our minds." Baldwin did not approve of using the word "war," because this word only serves to stir up a dangerous state of mind, especially in countries that rely on their government for information. Baldwin continued that the lessons learned from this dispute have shown that for the sake of world peace, our national defense must be stronger than it is now. He did not mean to unilaterally rearm, in reality or in imagination, to deal with any one country. He really wanted to strengthen defense within the League of Nations framework to seek international peace, not to achieve selfish goals. We are now taking risks for peace, and the government sees no other way than to align Britain's policy with the collective security policy that the League of Nations can implement. He is now prepared to concentrate on carrying out this policy. If he does not have sufficient power to remedy the defects in Britain's national defense after the Great War, he does not want to carry out this policy. If the League of Nations fails this time, then we must study how to make the League of Nations fully capable. Baldwin concluded by defending his decision to dissolve Parliament, saying that he intended to hold the general election early so that it could be completely smooth. He would not dare say this if it were postponed until January next year. The debate will continue tomorrow. Baldwin refused to grant the Labour Party time to put forward a motion of no confidence on unemployment. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Situation in Xianghe Increasingly Serious - An Houzhai Refuses to Hand Over County Administration - Liu Yaodong Detained by Rioters - City Gates Half-Closed, Traffic Disrupted</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xianghe County Magistrate Zhao Chongpu fled Xianghe with the county government seal on the 22nd, arriving in Tongxian on the 23rd. On the morning of the 24th, he came to Beiping from Tongxian and met with Shang Zhen to report on the incident. According to Shang Zhen, after the riots by rebels in Xianghe County, local order is now being maintained by a team dispatched by the 1st Brigade of the Security Forces. The Provincial Government has specially dispatched Liu Yaodong to thoroughly investigate the truth and act as county magistrate. He has recently reported that he has not been able to take over. The ignorant people in the area have been incited and refuse to hand over the administration. Appropriate and effective measures will be taken to resolve this. There has been no additional tax levied on Xianghe's land tax. This is just an excuse used by the rebels. Military Attaché Takahashi will arrive in Beiping tonight and will discuss appropriate solutions. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Public Security Bureau of Xianghe County is still occupied by rioters. Rioters surrounding the city have mostly dispersed due to fear of the cold at night. Liu Yaodong, a provincial councilor, and Meng Zhaoxing, chief of the General Affairs Department of the 1st Brigade of the Security Forces, contacted the rioter leaders An Houzhai and Wu Zhenyi to negotiate the withdrawal from the county government and other agencies, but without success. The rioters have many demands and different opinions. The 2nd Battalion of the 135th Division of the 32nd Army and the Security Forces are maintaining order in the city and suburbs, and there have been no accidents. The city gates reopened for traffic on the afternoon of the 24th. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A phone call from Tongxian on the evening of the 24th reported that Liu Yaodong, the acting county magistrate of Xianghe appointed by the provincial government, was detained by rioters in the Public Security Bureau on the afternoon of the 24th. A company of the 2nd Battalion of the 32nd Army is stationed outside the city. The rioters have closed the four city gates, cutting off traffic. An Houzhai, Wu Huan, and others met and decided to refuse to hand over the county administration. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Baoding) Wang Runsheng, an inspector of the Department of Civil Affairs, reported to the department on the 24th with a detailed account of the Xianghe incident. It has been determined that the matter is complex, and he intends to return to the province for instructions. The Department of Civil Affairs has telegraphed back to him not to return to Baoding for the time being, but to cooperate closely with Liu Yaodong, the provincial councilor dispatched by Shang Zhen, to handle the aftermath properly. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen instructed the Tianjin-Gukou Security Command to instruct the 141st and 142nd divisions of the 32nd Army, led by Song Kentang and Lü Ji, to be especially vigilant in Tongxian, Anci, Yongqing, and Jinghai counties to prevent subversive elements from instigating local ruffians to riot. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Zhao Arrives in Beiping with Seal</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Xianghe is still very chaotic. Although Liu Yaodong, a provincial councilor, has arrived in the county and been ordered to act as county magistrate, the pseudo-county magistrate An Houzhai is still refusing to hand over the administration. The security in the city is temporarily maintained by Jiang Enliang, the head of the security corps, in conjunction with Wang Futing, the president of the chamber of commerce. County Magistrate Zhao Zhongpu was forced to leave his post and arrived in Beiping on the evening of the 23rd via Tongxian with the county seal. On the morning of the 24th, he met with Shang Zhen to report on the incident. According to people from Xianghe, this civil unrest is entirely a reactionary act. The request to reduce taxes is just an excuse. The main instigators are local despots such as Wu Yuan. Since the beginning of this month, they have been gathering their followers at the residence of Hu Chengwu in Anfuzhai, Xianghe County, for secret meetings to discuss ways to resist the county administration. On the 18th, they held another meeting at An Houzhai's residence and decided to launch the action immediately. On the 20th, they gathered more than a thousand villagers and began to surround the county seat, threatening the county magistrate to resign and hand over the county seal. The county government and the Public Security Bureau, fearing that criminals would take the opportunity to steal and commit crimes, ordered the police and security forces to close the city gates tightly to prevent entry, and arrested three leading figures, including Chen Zhiru, and three foreigners for interrogation. At that time, more and more villagers gathered, threatening to break into the city. After a day-long standoff, on the 22nd, more than 20 armed soldiers from the Japanese garrison arrived in the county by car for investigation. They entered the city through the west gate and took away the three arrested foreigners. At this time, the telephone and telegraph lines near the county seat were cut off, making communication impossible. The mutinous villagers in the city shouted that the county magistrate must resign and hand over the county seal. They also shouted reactionary slogans and fired shots to demonstrate. The police in the city also returned fire, resulting in a conflict. After several hours of fighting, the villagers swarmed into the city, opened the city gates, occupied the county government and the Public Security Bureau, and seized firearms. Shops in the city were all closed to prevent looting. County Magistrate Zhao Zhongpu had heard the news and fled to nearby residences. Bai Zhichun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, fell from the Kuixing Pavilion in the east, trying to escape, but injured his right foot and was captured by the rioters, who tied him up and imprisoned him in the Tianqi Temple, and then moved him to Tiandedian, not allowing anyone to see him. At the same time, they pursued the county magistrate, but fortunately failed to capture him. After the mutinous villagers entered the city, they publicly elected An Houzhai as the county magistrate. The three arrested prisoners, including Chen Zhiru, also escaped during the chaos. Currently, businesses in the county have not yet reopened, and the atmosphere is dismal. The security force has advanced to the southwest of the Baihe River for security purposes. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>32nd Army Dispatched to Suppress</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen stated that the provincial government dispatched Councilor Liu Yaodong to Xianghe to investigate the truth and appointed Liu as the acting county magistrate. However, due to environmental reasons, Liu was unable to take over, so no one is currently responsible for the county administration. In order to maintain public order, if the mutinous villagers refuse to hand over the administration, the provincial government will take appropriate measures. As for the inside story, no concrete report has been received yet. The county seat is currently being maintained by the security force. The 32nd Army has decided to dispatch a unit of troops to suppress the rebellion. County Magistrate Zhao Zhongpu has arrived in Beiping. The rioters claim to be resisting tax increases, but this is just a false pretext. Since I took office, I have not increased taxes. Additional land taxes exist in all counties, and this tax is used to protect local security and is not transferred to the province for other purposes. Therefore, the rioters' reasons are completely inadequate. Rumors that Changping, Wuqing, and Sanhe counties will also take similar actions are absolutely untrue. Several Japanese vagrants have been arrested by the Japanese military police. Takahashi will return to Beiping on the 24th, and I will visit him to discuss solutions. The selection of a special commissioner for the Ji-Mi district is being discussed with the central government. Rumors that the two districts will be merged are not true. The Luanhe River Police Bureau is being prepared. There are no more bandits in the counties of the war zone. I will stay for another day or two and then return to Baoding. Due to complicated political affairs, it may be difficult to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Beijing. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Authorities Claim: No Truth to Claims of New Japanese Demands - Central Army Grand Exercises Not Yet Timely - No Such Thing as 80,000 Troops Passing Through Zhejiang - Possibly Misinformation About Two Divisions Being Transferred Back for Reorganization</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, there have been many rumors in Shanghai about Sino-Japanese relations, with some saying that Japan is preparing to make new demands, and that these new demands contain six or thirteen items. A reporter approached diplomatic authorities about this, and the responsible party replied that the rumors are completely untrue. The government has not received any demands from the Japanese side recently. At a time when the Sino-Japanese authorities are working to improve relations between the two countries, there would be no so-called new demands. The official hopes that the people of the country will not be misled by rumors. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, there have been external rumors that the Central Army will hold autumn military exercises this year, and that a large army will pass through Zhejiang Province. On the 24th, a reporter visited military officials to inquire about the truth. Here is a transcript of their Q&amp;A with the reporter: (Reporter Q): "It is widely rumored that a large-scale land and air military exercise of 100,000 troops will be held this year, spanning the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Is this true?" (A): "Not only is this not true, but there is no preparation for it. Every year in the autumn, countries in the East and West often hold special military exercises. Our country is busy suppressing bandits, and all troops are performing anti-banditry missions. It is difficult to draw several divisions of troops to do this. After the Communists are eliminated, it may be possible to do this. Now is not the time. As for the training of divisions and brigades, self-directed exercises are common at any time and place." (Q): "Recently, I heard that 80,000 troops have passed through Zhejiang. Is this true?" (A): "There is no such thing. Only two divisions, who were excessively fatigued from years of bandit suppression, were transferred back for reorganization and passed through Zhejiang. External rumors may refer to this."

<h3>What is Expected of American Newspaper Leaders</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>There are two major newspaper groups in the United States. One is the Hearst newspaper group controlled by Mr. Hearst. The other is the Howard newspaper group controlled by Mr. Roy W. Howard. There are two major news agencies in the United States. One is the Associated Press, jointly operated by many American newspapers. The other is the United Press, controlled by Mr. Howard. Mr. Howard is now the highest authority in the American news industry. His thinking is correct, his experience is rich, and his vision is sharp, which cannot be compared to the stubborn Mr. Hearst, and he is also the one who was praised as a formidable younger generation by the late Mr. Scripps. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Philippine autonomous government, Mr. Howard kindly came to China, staying in Beijing and Shanghai for two weeks. We, from the perspective of the newspaper industry, should sincerely welcome this most successful American journalist. We, from the perspective of the Chinese people, should even more sincerely welcome this most suitable representative of the American people.</p>
<p>In the past fifty years, the newspaper business jointly operated by Mr. Scripps and Mr. Howard has made remarkable progress. Currently, the newspaper group has 26 newspapers. From New York to San Francisco, there is the influence of this newspaper system. Several years ago, Mr. Howard purchased the New York "World" and reorganized it into the "World-Telegram," making it the central newspaper of the group. He served as the general manager of the newspaper and the newspaper group, using extremely progressive management methods and extremely powerful editorial policies to make this newspaper a central organ for the expression of progressive thinkers in the United States. This has made this newspaper group not only successful in business but also achieved great results in guiding the public and supervising government work. Now, the US government's domestic economic policies and foreign policy announcements often go through Mr. Howard's consultation. For several years, the issues he has been most concerned about are: one, the extent of economic control by the US government; and two, the relationship between China, Japan, and the United States. On these two issues, he often has very noteworthy expressions. During the September 18th Incident, he expressed deep regret to Japan. However, he has been striving to advocate Sino-Japanese friendship. A few months ago, he questioned President Roosevelt's economic policy. The President responded publicly with a long letter. Although he has doubts about the President, he has been striving to advocate for the interests of the economically disadvantaged. The United Press dispatches are sold to 2,500 newspapers. Hundreds of newspapers outside the United States subscribe to its dispatches. The Chinese National News Agency also uses its dispatches. It is admirable that one person can create such a large-scale enterprise. His perseverance is enviable. We welcome Mr. Howard and hope that he can provide guidance and suggestions to the Chinese newspaper industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have more expectations of Mr. Howard. Newspapers are the source of the greatest power in a democratic country. Journalists are the guiding force in a democratic country. Internally, they are responsible for enlightening the public and guiding politics. Externally, they represent the entire nation, conveying and communicating the opinions of various ethnic groups and promoting international friendship and harmony. Mr. Howard has made great efforts in these two aspects in the past. This time, staying in China for two weeks, he should be able to better understand the wishes of the Chinese people and have a more accurate understanding of the location of the conflicts and crises between China, Japan, and the United States. Therefore, using the power of public opinion to promote government attention and enlighten the understanding of 120 million Americans on the China issue will not only enhance the traditional friendship between China and the United States but also make an important contribution to the solution of the Pacific issue. Today, more than half of American newspaper readers and more than half of the educated class rely on Howard's newspapers and the United Press as their ears and eyes. This newspaper system is most trusted by the government and supported by the people in the American news industry. The feelings and thoughts of the 600 million people on the left and right banks of the Pacific Ocean depend on Mr. Howard as a bridge. We hope that Mr. Howard will make good use of his important position and rare opportunity to fulfill the noble responsibilities of a journalist for the people of these two great countries. This is also the hope that we wish to express to Mr. Howard in addition to our welcome.</p>

The Secretariat of the Plenary Session has been established. A Central Committee member said that the date of this session may be slightly shorter than previous sessions because all major issues need to be resolved at the Fifth National Congress. According to the Party Constitution, the Fifth National Congress should have been held in January 1933. At that time, the national crisis was severe, so it was postponed for one year. In 1934, it was postponed again due to the request of Central Committee members in the Southwest. The venue for the Congress has been decided to be the Central Auditorium. The auditorium has been prepared with 550 seats, which is sufficient for the actual number of attendees. Reports that it will be held in the Central University Auditorium are not true. In addition, the Central Committee has long set the expenses of the Congress at over 400,000 yuan. This amount is used to cover the round-trip travel expenses of overseas representatives, accounting for over 300,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance is currently allocating the funds in installments.

<h3>Salt River Water Level Rises, Banpu Situation Critical, More Than a Thousand Families Flooded Outside the City, All Salt Affairs Audit Offices Submerged</h3>

<p>(Washington) The Naval Conference will be held in London in early December. It is reported that it will also discuss the redistribution of world resources.

The claim to redistribute world resources was first seen in British Foreign Secretary Hall's speech to the League of Nations General Assembly in mid-September. Japan took advantage of it and planned to raise this issue at the London Conference. Swanson therefore declared that economic issues should not be included in the agenda. It is already very difficult to adjust purely naval issues. If other issues are added, the difficulty will be unbearable. Mr. Shi further said that Japan's demand for naval equality has not changed, and the United States still insists on the 5-5-3 ratio, so the naval conference is unlikely to be effective, which can be predicted.

<h3>The Xianghe Civil Uprising: An Account</h3>
<p>The Inside Story Reveals that Unscrupulous Individuals Were Manipulating Events from Behind the Scenes; Personnel Have Been Dispatched for Thorough Investigation to Determine Appropriate Measures; The Rioters Are Maintaining Order, and the Situation Is Unlikely to Escalate; The City's Security is Temporarily Maintained by the Home Guard</p>
<p>(Special Correspondence from Beiping) In the counties near the "war zone" of Hebei Province, bizarre rumors have recently circulated. Some say that Bai Jianwu, Shi Yousan, and others are about to make trouble, while others claim that the people, unable to bear the increased tax burden, are preparing to resist. Upon receiving these reports, the authorities immediately ordered all subordinate counties to take strict precautions and to search for and arrest rumor-mongering bandits. Unexpectedly, on the 18th of this month, news of unrest among the people in Xianghe reached us. By the 20th, the situation had become significantly more serious. More than a thousand farmers gathered outside the East Gate of the county, posting handbills that were absurd and outrageous. County Magistrate Zhao Xiyuan, as a precautionary measure, immediately ordered the four city gates to be tightly closed, prohibiting people from passing through. On the evening of the 20th, the noise outside the city increased as more and more villagers gathered. On the morning of the 21st, the crowd had grown to over two thousand people. At noon that day, the rioters outside the city suddenly threw handbills into the city, threatening the residents inside to respond with absurd wording that reached extremes. The handbills stated that the city was about to be breached and that the people inside should quickly bind and send the county magistrate to them to avoid total destruction. County Magistrate Zhao Xiyuan, seeing the situation, feared that the people inside the city would be unfavorable to him and secretly left his post in disguise. The people in the county government, seeing that the leading figure was gone, also fled. Bai Chunzhi, the head of the Public Security Bureau, also feared death and fled far away. The city's security fell into a state of anarchy. On the morning of the 22nd, Jiang Enlian, the head of the Home Guard, led the guards and maintained order. Xianghe County does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Ji-Mi district, but it borders Tong County. When the authorities received the earliest report from the county, in order to seek a peaceful resolution and avoid escalating the situation, they immediately ordered the Ji-Mi District Commissioner's Office to quickly dispatch personnel to investigate thoroughly. At the same time, upon hearing that Japanese ruffians were participating in the riot, a special commissioner contacted the Japanese side, and the Japanese side sent 20 military police officers, led by squad leader Ōtani, to inspect the situation on the 21st. Two Japanese ruffians were arrested on the spot. The Japanese military police then entered the city, negotiated everything, and returned to Beiping that evening. At 7:00 a.m. on the 22nd, the rioters surrounded the city again, sending representatives to the authorities to request tax exemptions. Jiang Enlian, the head of the county's Home Guard, was unable to respond because County Magistrate Zhao Xiyuan had fled. He had no choice but to order the Home Guard to open the city gates and let all the rioters in. The rioters' leader, Wu Yuting, and others then negotiated with Jiang to organize a temporary maintenance committee. The gentry An Houqi was publicly elected to temporarily assume the duties of the county magistrate until the county magistrate returned to office. Other bureau chiefs and section chiefs were also temporarily replaced by others. The city's security returned to normal by noon. On the 22nd, Zhang Qingyu, the commander of the First Security Corps of Hebei Province, received an order from the Ji-Mi District Commissioner's Office to dispatch one platoon of the Seventh Security Detachment, stationed in Sanhe, to the vicinity of Xianghe County to prevent the rioters from disturbing the "war zone". He also sent personnel to cooperate with Gao Shimo, the section chief of the Ji-Mi District Commissioner's Office, and others to go to Xianghe to investigate the truth in order to respond accordingly.</p>
<p>At 7:00 a.m. on the 23rd, Zhang Qingyu took a car from Tong County to Ping to meet with Chairman Shang Zhen of Hebei to report everything and request instructions. Shang then went to the Military Affairs Commission at around 9:00 a.m. to attend a routine meeting and report on the measures taken regarding the Xianghe incident. Committee members in Ping such as Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and He Jingwu were all present. It is said that the committee members believed that since the rioters in the city were able to maintain considerable order, the Hebei Provincial Government should quickly find a way to appease them and resolve the dispute in order to prevent the situation from escalating. There was no in-depth discussion beyond that. After Shang returned to his residence, he sent personnel to the military attaché's office of the Japanese Embassy to meet with the person in charge, expressing that the Xianghe incident would be handled peacefully. The Japanese side was quite understanding. The reporter visited Shang at noon, and according to Shang's talk, (1) the cause of this incident was the manipulation by unscrupulous local gentry from behind the scenes. The county magistrate has left the county, but according to reports, local order has gradually recovered, and the situation is unlikely to escalate. (2) After receiving the report, the provincial government has sent Liu Yaodong to the area to conduct a thorough investigation. After learning the details, a concrete plan for handling the situation will be determined. (3) During this winter defense period, a civil uprising occurred in the county, which greatly affected local order. In order to maintain tranquility, I intend to transfer a part of the 32nd Army to suppress it. (4) I will remain in Ping for a few more days to deal with this incident before returning to Baoding and going to Beijing, etc. There is no such preparation at the moment.</p>
<p>In summary, although the Xianghe civil uprising is ostensibly a request for tax exemptions, officials say that there have been no tax increases in various counties of Hebei Province recently. Two weeks ago, the party members of Bai Jianwu were arrested in Zunhua County. According to their confession, Bai and Shi Yousan were preparing to simultaneously stir up trouble in various counties of Hebei Province on October 24th. Upon receiving the report, the authorities have been on alert in various counties. Although there have been rumors of similar incidents in Changping, Wuqing, and other counties in recent days, officials have not received any reports, so they are still denying it. (October 23)</p>
<p>Songjiang: City and Suburban Defense During Power Outage</p>
<p>This city's electric company washes the boiler once a year and stops the electricity for three days. This year, from the 22nd to the 24th, the power supply will be stopped for three days. It has been submitted to the county government for approval. However, during the period of the power outage, the city and suburban defenses have been ordered to strengthen patrols by the 12th Security Brigade headquarters, the water patrol team, the Public Security Bureau, and the district offices. For temporary street lighting, the No. 1 District Office has prepared a large number of mast lamps, which are set up and hung up for the convenience of pedestrians. In recent days, officers and soldiers of the 12th Security Brigade headquarters, the Public Security Bureau, and the water patrol team, as well as Shen Fuyun, the head of the No. 1 District, have personally led patrols, so the local area is as peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Inspect Various Districts</p>
<p>Wu Zhuren, an inspector from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, was ordered to investigate whether the cooperatives and agricultural warehouses in Wujin and other counties are legal and how the business is being handled. He arrived in Changzhou on the evening of the 22nd and immediately notified the county government to send personnel to guide him to inspect various districts. County Magistrate Hou Houzong assigned Wang Qinghao, a cooperative instructor, to accompany him. Inspector Wu first went to the Farmers Bank to investigate the registers of cooperatives and agricultural warehouses in various districts. On the 23rd, Wang Qinghao accompanied him to the countryside to investigate various districts separately.</p>

After being summarized and reviewed, it is also planned to promote the planting of tung trees uniformly from next spring to increase local production and save the rural economy of Xiao Zi.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: City Police Officer's Rifle Taken Away by Bandits</p>
<p>Chen Yan, a police officer of the Second Patrol Post of the Jiangdu Public Security First Sub-bureau stationed in Xu Ningdou, was on duty guarding the night at about 1:00 a.m. on the 22nd. When patrolling to the intersection of Sixi Road, he saw two people in gray short coats coming down from the Nanhe River, each holding a flashlight. Suspecting their behavior, he shouted for them to stop and went forward to inquire. The two men, about thirty years old, spoke in a Hakka accent and claimed to be going to Kangshan on business. During the questioning, one of them reached into his pocket, and Police Officer Chen immediately grabbed his hand, finding a pistol in the pocket. He shouted that there were bandits. Yang Yuncheng, a police officer resting at the post, was startled awake from his sleep and rushed over. The long gun carried by Police Officer Chen had been snatched from behind by another bandit, who pointed the gun at Chen and shouted for Chen to let go. The two bandits then fled in the direction of Kangshan, firing their guns as a warning as they left. The police officers then reported to Chief Chen of this post, describing the loss of the long gun and the process of obtaining the pistol. The patrol chief led the police to chase after them, and reported to the Public Security Bureau through the First Sub-bureau, immediately dispatching police officers to follow and search on horseback, and inspecting various checkpoints nearby. The bandits were nowhere to be found.</p>

In addition to the court sending officials to inspect the body, her husband, Fei Guansheng, was detained by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the court for interrogation. He was subsequently released on bail. On the 22nd, the court summoned the mediator, and Fei was brought to court for questioning. However, Fei was working as an electrician in Shanghai and was unable to attend the court. The trial was postponed.</p>

<p>Letter: Letter from the Changlu Salt Inspection Office and Tax Police Bureau</p>
<p>Recently, I read your newspaper's second page, which published a section on "Several Thousand Zhuang Miners from Quyang, Jinnan, Contacting Pingxiang and Setting Up a Village, Clashing with Tax Police." This is inconsistent with the facts. According to the investigation, this riot was not by miners, but by accumulated bandits such as Li Xiu, Liu Erxiao, etc., who gathered crowds to attack Pingxiang County last year. They colluded with communist bandits and reactionary elements and gathered to cause trouble with ulterior motives. The number of people was not in the thousands. They attacked the Independent Battalion of the Tax Police Corps Headquarters in Youjiazhuang East, not clashing with the Changlu Tax Police. The Beiping Military Affairs Commission and the Hebei Provincial Government have telegraphed the garrisoning military police to suppress and eliminate these stockades and bandits who have gathered crowds in a timely manner. I hope that you will disclose this to clarify the truth and avoid false rumors. This is indeed a public matter. The Changlu Salt Affairs Inspection Office and Tax Police Bureau. October 22.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Proclamation: Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Prohibition of Opium and Drugs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued a proclamation yesterday stating: "It has been found that the National Government Military Commission Chairman's Office Order No. 239 opened with: The Central Political Conference's letter opening, the 459th meeting regarding the matter of opium prohibition resolved as follows: (1) The Opium Prohibition Law is abolished. (2) The Opium Prohibition Committee is dissolved. (3) A Superintendent-General of Opium Prohibition is established to handle national opium prohibition matters, concurrently held by the Chairman of the Military Commission. (4) Laws on the prohibition of opium and drugs are separately formulated and sent to this conference for record. (5) The provisions of Chapter 20 on Opium Crimes in the new criminal law shall be suspended within the area where the regulations on the prohibition of opium and drugs ordered by the Superintendent-General of Opium Prohibition are applied, etc. In addition to clearly ordering the abolition of the Opium Prohibition Committee, a Superintendent-General of Opium Prohibition was specially appointed, and the Superintendent-General of Opium Prohibition was informed for reference. Item 4 of the original resolution, to separately formulate laws on the prohibition of opium and drugs, will be promulgated and implemented by the government after being submitted to the government for record, and at the same time, the Opium Prohibition Law will be formally abolished, and Item 5 of the resolution will be promulgated. The above is hereby ordered for your information, etc. Furthermore, on June 5th of this year, the National Government issued a clear order, dissolving the Opium Prohibition Committee and specially appointing Chiang Kai-shek concurrently as the Superintendent-General of Opium Prohibition to handle national opium prohibition affairs, etc. Upon receiving this, it was found that strictly prohibiting opium and drugs and eliminating them within a limited time is our country's consistent policy throughout history. However, due to the lack of unity in authority, the effectiveness has not been significant. In addition, the spread of banditry and frequent changes in local areas, eliminating opium and drugs with certainty is difficult to implement. Although the government has repeatedly issued orders and statements, it is still loose and ineffective, and the harm is deepening daily. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was shocked and therefore revealed the policy of prohibiting drugs in two years and opium in six years, urging his subordinates to implement it with all their strength. Therefore, in May of last year, the Nanchang Headquarters first focused on the opium substitutes that are most harmful, such as morphine, cocaine, heroin, red and white pills, and other drugs, and gave special heavy punishments to criminals. The Provisional Regulations on the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs were promulgated and circulated in various provinces, taking the meaning of using severe punishments to manage chaos, as a way to kill one to warn a hundred. It has been implemented for a year and has had a great effect. The scourge of drugs has gradually been cleared, and the atmosphere has changed greatly. Opium has also been repeatedly issued laws and ordered to be strictly prohibited. However, the penalties stipulated in the Opium Prohibition Law are relatively light, and the judicial procedures are extremely slow. The people are accustomed to old habits and have no power to save themselves, and the crime of smoking opium is punishable by fines or only the minimum term of imprisonment. Cultivation, transportation, sale, and trafficking are also lightly punished, which is enough to encourage cunning people to gradually take advantage of the law. It is also not in line with the methods of unified control of opium prohibition and gradual prohibition over the years. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was anxious day and night, believing that it was not enough to change the course and change the approach to facilitate progress and respond to the situation. Now, with the earnest order from the government, he is entrusted with the important task of national opium prohibition and should comply with the order to earnestly handle it. Based on past experiences in opium and drug prohibition, the needs of the current environment and facts, and with reference to various old and new laws and regulations, a detailed discussion was conducted, and after summaries and supplements, Provisional Regulations on Punishment for the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs were drafted, and opium and drug cases were transferred to the scope of military law. All trials and reviews are handled in accordance with military law procedures to increase efficiency and prevent disputes, in order to live up to the central government's intention to pay attention to the prohibition of opium and to assign it concurrently. In addition to submitting the regulations and requesting the National Government to promulgate and implement them, please also issue an order to abolish the Opium Prohibition Law and suspend the provisions of Chapter 20 on Opium Crimes in the new criminal law. The above is hereby ordered for the mayor's compliance, and you must supervise your subordinates to strictly comply with the regulations from the date of implementation of the regulations, and you should also widely warn the people in advance so that the people know what to be vigilant about and will not commit crimes. We have great expectations for this. This order is issued, and a copy of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs is included, etc. In addition to distributing it separately, this proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge. This proclamation."</p>

<p>Liujiang Coal Mine Company Sends Letter to Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Requests All Industries to Refuse to Buy Taiji Coal</p>
<p>Taiji's Own Mining Area Has Been Closed for Over Ten Years</p>
<p>Now Forcibly Occupying All Mining Property of Liujiang</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that all mining property of the Chinese Liujiang Coal Mine Company, and coal stored at the Qinhuangdao coal yard, has been forcibly occupied by Taiji Company. A letter has been sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various coal and shipping associations, requesting them to refuse to buy the coal illegally mined and transported by Taiji Company. At the same time, a lawsuit has been filed according to law. The letter from Liujiang Company to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is as follows:</p>
<p>Liujiang Company Letter</p>
<p>We respectfully inform you that our company has been mining coal in the Linyu County of Hebei Province for nearly twenty years. In March of this year, Taiji Company, a neighboring mine, suddenly claimed that our company's Black Mountain Kiln mining area overlapped with its mining area. Relying on Japanese influence, it illegally and forcibly occupied all mining property of our company and the coal stored at the Qinhuangdao coal yard. After repeated negotiations, no results have been achieved. It has been found that the company's own mining area has been closed for over ten years, and no coal is being sold. After forcibly occupying our mining area, it immediately started mining without authorization and plans to change the names of our old coal and newly mined coal to Taiji Coal, Linyu Coal, etc., and ship and sell them successively. Its disregard for law and reason is outrageous. Although the company is a Sino-Japanese joint venture, it is registered with our government and has obtained mining rights in accordance with our mining regulations. Naturally, it is a Chinese legal person like our company. The legal representative of the company is a Chinese national, which is also clearly stipulated in the Sino-Japanese joint venture contract. Therefore, our company's mining area has been legally acquired, and the company has no room to intervene. Even if there is a dispute, it should be subject to the judgment of the Chinese court. However, the company petitioned the Japanese police station to seal up our company's property by force, regardless of the facts. Its illegal and reckless behavior is beyond words. In addition to filing a lawsuit according to law, our company has also sent letters to various coal, shipping, and barge associations, requesting them to refuse to buy, transport, or barge the coal illegally mined and sold by the company, so as not to be implicated. We have long admired your association for leading the business community. We dare to briefly state the whole story, attach a summary, and earnestly request you to uphold justice, provide assistance, and notify all industries in this city to refuse to buy the above-mentioned coal, so as to maintain commerce and emphasize sovereignty. We are extremely hopeful.</p>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Reply</p>
<p>We received your letter on the 25th of this month, along with a summary of the mining area being occupied. It is understood. Since your company has filed a lawsuit according to law, the coal mined and sold illegally during the litigation period can be stopped. The key to this matter lies entirely in the coal industry, followed by the shipping industry. Other industries mostly purchase from the coal industry, so the relationship is relatively broad. Your company has already sent letters to the coal and shipping industries, requesting assistance, so the handling has been effective. It seems that there is no need to forward letters to other industries. We are sending a copy of the membership list. If your company believes it is necessary to widely notify, you can notify them yourself according to the names and addresses of the associations listed in the membership list.</p>

<p>Two Charitable Organizations Join Forces to Aid Flood Victims</p>
<p>The previous report covered the joint efforts of the Red Swastika Society and the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association of Renji Road to address the Yangtze River flood situation. It is now reported that after the leaders of the Red Swastika Society, Han Shichang and Li Tianzhen, arrived in Hubei Province, they earnestly discussed the situation with the heads of the Hankou branch. They allocated over 100,000 yuan in relief funds, deciding to start with Tianmen, Hanyang, Hanchuan, Zhongxiang, and other counties. After sending personnel to investigate, it was found that although the accumulated water in the disaster areas had receded by 70%, the roads were muddy and submerged to the shins. In areas where the water had not receded, boats were still being used on the dikes. Not only did the disaster victims have no means of finding food, but the relief teams also faced great difficulties in traveling. The severity of the disaster was even greater than the major disaster of 1931. The association is now actively continuing its investigation and relief work in Hanyang and Hanchuan. The association's work report in Hunan Province is recorded below:</p>
<p>Hanyang Area</p>
<p>Hanyang has the highest number of disaster victims among the counties. The majority of the victims are living on the slopes of the mountains. In addition to the eight forts in Qingyuan and other places where the Red Swastika Society has already provided emergency relief, 28 forts and the Parrot Isle area still need continued relief. According to statistics, there are more than 17,600 households and over 90,000 people affected. Team leader Chen Tianru has decided to divide the team into three groups. The first group will be responsible for the Lianpu areas of Caidian, Xiansheng, Taihu, Tongle, and Yu Chen. The second group will be responsible for the Lianpu areas of Chenghuang, Xinglong, Huangling, Yunlong, Chongxing, Cong Zhuhui, Tianshui, Wuling, Fushan, Helin, Huangqi, Longquan, Xinshou, and Lei Xi. The third group will be responsible for the Lianpu areas of Meifeng, Taishan, Tonggang, Guoxing, Dongyang, Juelu, Taiping, Guanfu, and Guangse.</p>
<p>Hanchuan Area</p>
<p>Each township in the Fifth District of Hanchuan has been inspected and surveyed by Team Leader Ouyang Dulin. There are a total of 4,119 households and 17,185 people, both adults and children. The team has already departed for the Tianerhe Town in the Fourth District, which is divided into 89 forts in four townships, with a total of more than 3,900 households and more than 17,700 people, both adults and children. Despite the continuous wind and rain, the team members set off in the rain without showing any signs of fatigue. They have also allocated 700 piles and nine dan of broad beans in the first district, as well as mixed grains such as Guoji Miao rice. 326 dan will be delivered to the second district, 815 dan to the third district, and 1,935 packages to the fourth district.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in Hunan Province</p>
<p>The flood disaster in Hunan Province is most severe in the ten or more counties along the lake. The Red Swastika Society has previously sent a team to conduct emergency relief in Hanshou and Changde counties in the province. They witnessed disaster victims living in the water on various embankments. Each embankment had as many as tens of thousands of people, and at least several thousand, with no clothes and no food. The miserable situation could not be described in writing. The relief funds allocated by the association this time were only 5,000 yuan per county. Distributing this amount to one embankment is still insufficient, let alone extending it to Fengxian, Shimen, Cili, and other counties where the disaster is even more severe. It is hoped that people of goodwill from all walks of life will generously donate to save these survivors. It is reported that after the two associations received the above report, they immediately allocated 29,000 yuan in relief funds to be received and allocated by the two leaders, Han and Li.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Railway Adds Locomotives</p>
<p>Four Arrive in Wuhu, Eight Arrive in Wusong</p>
<p>Starting November 1st, One More Train Will be Added in Each Direction</p>
<p>Since the Jiangnan Railway Company started operations, transportation between Jiangsu and Anhui has become more convenient. The company's existing locomotives are insufficient for use. The company has specially ordered twelve locomotives from foreign merchants, which have been successively shipped to Shanghai. Among them, four locomotives were assembled in Germany and transported by special ship. They arrived in Wuhu the day before yesterday. The remaining eight locomotives have also arrived at the Wusong Wharf for assembly and transport to Beijing for use. The Beijing-Wuhu line originally had three passenger trains operating in each direction. Now that a large number of locomotives have arrived, it has been decided to add one more train in each direction starting on November 1st to facilitate travel.</p>

<p>In the Midst of Social Recession, Two People Commit Suicide Due to Unemployment</p>
<p>Li Deming...Xu Yuanliang</p>
<p>Li Deming was from Jiashan. Li Deming, 32 years old, inexplicably, around 8:00 PM yesterday, the teahouse servant suddenly heard a groaning sound coming from room 13. He quickly opened the door to investigate and saw that Li's face was pale and he was tossing and turning on the side of the bed. The servant reported to the police station, and Li was taken to the hospital for treatment. A suicide note was found on his person, stating that he was committing suicide due to prolonged unemployment and financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Xu Yuanliang was a local. Xu Yuanliang, 22 years old, checked into the Nanjing Hotel in Hongyunfang, Mogao Baolu Road, French Concession, on the 22nd of this month. He booked room 56. His behavior was normal. Inexplicably, around 2:00 AM yesterday, the teahouse servants suddenly heard a groaning sound coming from room 56. They called out to him, but there was no response. They quickly pushed the door open and saw Xu unconscious, foaming at the mouth. An empty bottle of poison was left beside his pillow, indicating that he had taken poison. The servants reported to the police station, and Xu was taken to the hospital for treatment. A suicide note was found on his person, stating that he used to work with silk fabrics, but recently, due to unemployment, his financial situation had deteriorated day by day, and he had no choice but to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Kunshan Kidnapped Boy, Zhu Ata, Rescued</p>
<p>Kidnappers Arrested on Vegetable Market Street</p>
<p>Kidnapped Boy Rescued at Gaochang Temple</p>
<p>Zhu Xingqing, a farmer from Fumatang, Kunshan County, had some wealth, which aroused the envy of bandits. In late September of this year, bandits broke into Zhu's house in the dark of night and kidnapped Zhu's 12-year-old son, Zhu Ata, hiding him and extorting a large ransom. Zhu reported to the county government's public security bureau for investigation. The county government requested the assistance of the naval and land forces and police to assist in the arrest. Gao Chao, the deputy captain of the second detective team stationed in Suzhou by the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, received confidential information that the bandits' accomplices were hiding in Shanghai. Gao immediately led detectives and informants to Shanghai to investigate. Around midnight the day before yesterday, they found the bandits Wang Shengsheng (28 years old) and Chen Ziheng (47 years old), both from Anhui, hiding in room 9 of the Zhonghua Xiaoke Inn at 295 Vegetable Market Street, French Concession. Gao reported to the French police station for assistance in the arrest. Inspector Jin Jiulin, detective Zhou Bingcheng, detective Zhu Jutong, Zhao Chunsheng, etc., went to room 9 of the Zhonghua Inn at the address yesterday at 1:00 AM and arrested the two bandits Wang and Chen. Two suspected Anhui natives, Shi Shubang (28 years old) and Zhang Zhichun (28 years old), were also arrested on the floor below the inn. A search was conducted, but nothing was found. The four were taken back to the police station. It was found that Wang Shengsheng had been deported from the concession in the first month of 1931 (the 20th year of the Republic) for a kidnapping case. Wang was interrogated strictly. Wang confessed that the kidnapped boy, Zhu Ata, was currently hidden in a thatched cottage at 5 Manufacturing Bureau Road, South Shanghai. The police station ordered Wang and the other three to be detained. Gao Chao immediately reported to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and dispatched police detectives to assist in going to the thatched cottage at 5 Manufacturing Bureau Road. They rescued the kidnapped boy and captured several male and female accomplices, who were taken back to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The French police station learned that the kidnapped boy had been rescued in South Shanghai and sent the four suspects Wang to the Second Special District Court's Criminal Court. Yao Qidi, the lawyer of the police department, explained the case to the court, stating that the four defendants were arrested for a kidnapping case in Kunshan at the request of the Water Police. He requested that the court interrogate them. Detective Zhu Jutong reported the process of arresting the defendants. Gao Qi, an official from the second district of the Water Police, claimed that he had been ordered by the Department of Civil Affairs to solve the case within a time limit after the kidnapping occurred. He arrested a bandit party, Jing Shijiafu, and interrogated him for clues. Recently, based on confidential information, he came to Shanghai to investigate until the night before yesterday, when he found the address and reported to the police station to arrest the defendants. Regarding Shi and Zhang, the informant said that although they were not very involved, they were fellow villagers of Wang and Chen and were suspected of conspiring with the bandits, so they were arrested together. He requested permission to transfer them to investigate and arrest the ringleaders Li Wuzi and Chen Shengchun. Wang Shengsheng confessed that he knew Deng Zipeng when he was selling smuggled salt in Pudong. Deng entrusted him to send meals to the child at Li's widow's house. Deng said that the child was born to his concubine, and he did not know that he was kidnapped and did not participate in the kidnapping. Yesterday, he met his fellow villager Chen Ziheng and stayed in a hotel together. Chen Ziheng confessed that he came to Shanghai from his hometown not long ago and had not found a job. He met Wang and lived in the inn together and did not know about the kidnapping. Shi Shubang and Zhang Zhichun confessed that they did not know Wang and Chen. We two lived in the inn together. Wang and others were arrested first, and then we were arrested together because we were both from Anhui. Please investigate. Chief Judge Wang Gangxu verified the confession and approved Wang Shengsheng and Chen Ziheng to be handed over to the Water Police for interrogation and trial. Shi Shubang and Zhang Zhichun were temporarily detained, and the officials were required to provide sufficient evidence within seven days for further verification.</p>

<p>Luo Yusheng Sentenced</p>
<p>Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lawyer Luo Zhaoxin was assassinated in Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road, last year. His son, Luo Yusheng, 21 years old, was the director of education at the Mingchen Elementary School on Xinqiao Road in Nanshi. On the morning of September 23 of this year, at 8:30 AM, he gathered a gang and went to 459 North Henan Road, where he killed the woman Jin Dai and the maid Luo Guo with axes. Hu Shangwu, a Chinese detective from the Huishi Police Station, arrested Luo Yusheng and sent him to the First Special District Court. The details of the interrogation and confession have been recorded in this newspaper several times. Yesterday morning, the time for sentencing arrived. Trial Judge Liu Yugui ascended to the eighth criminal court and announced the verdict. The main text stated that Luo Yusheng was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of joint murder, with deprivation of civil rights for life. He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the crime of theft, to be executed with life imprisonment, with deprivation of civil rights for life. The two axes used in the crime were confiscated. The civil litigation portion was transferred to the civil court of this court. The silver, money, passbooks, deposit slips, and gold ring belonging to Jin Dai should be investigated and returned. The remaining stolen goods will be temporarily detained, pending resolution by civil litigation.</p>

<p>China Science Society 20th Anniversary Special Publication A Review of Twenty Years of the China Science Society By Ren Hongjun</p>
<p>The China Science Society has been established for twenty years now. During these twenty years, it has experienced the unprecedented World War, the Chinese National Revolution, and countless changes in social thought. However, the Society's work has not only been unaffected by these influences, but has also continued to grow and develop to its present scale. As we look back, we are not only celebrating the Society's achievements, but also the future of science in China.</p>
<p>Looking back to the beginning of the Society's establishment twenty years ago, it was just a few students who, witnessing the prosperity of Western culture and the backwardness of academic thought in our country, believed that even with fundamental remedies, it would not be effective without introducing the entirety of scientific thought. Thus, holding writing brushes, they did not care about their lack of experience and sought to use literary promotion to achieve the great cause of so-called ideological reform. This is why the "Science" monthly magazine was the first undertaking of our Society. This journal has now been published up to Volume 19, Issue 10, and it has made a small but significant contribution to publicizing scientific progress and promoting scientific research, which is recognized by the academic community in our country.</p>
<p>Secondly, it was believed that to promote scientific progress, it is better to put it into practice than to talk about it in empty words. Therefore, in the autumn of the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), the Institute of Biology was established. The establishment of this institute was the first case of a private organization establishing a research institute in the country. However, the difficult operating conditions of our Society at that time would be laughable if told. At the beginning of the institute's establishment, researchers received no salary, and the annual operating expenses were only a few hundred yuan. Now, combining subsidies from outside the Society and the Society's own funds, the monthly expenditure is more than 5,000 yuan. As for the institute's products and achievements, they have already been well-regarded in the world's biological community, and there is no need for us to elaborate further. What we want to say now is that our Society's advocacy of science, with the establishment of a research institute as a model, is different from other empty words without substance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to develop science and facilitate research, the establishment of a library is essential and should be the first priority of an academic society. Our Society began organizing a library in the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919). At that time, it was just a few rooms in the Nanjing Society, used as a place for members to store books collectively. Now, the Mingfu Library has been built in Shanghai, with tens of thousands of scientific books and hundreds of types of Chinese and foreign scientific journals, becoming a treasure trove for culture in Southeast China. Recently, the Scientific Book and Instrument Company has been added, striving to publish and supply instruments, and its future contribution to the development of science is immeasurable. For example, the "Science Pictorial" semi-monthly magazine, which was published in recent years, fulfills a long-felt need in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>So, how can our Society, as a private academic organization, continue to develop for twenty years and thrive, with unlimited prospects? To summarize, there are several reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Social Sympathy. When our Society was founded, it was very simple. Without the sympathy of enlightened predecessors in society, it would not have been easy to grow and prosper. To name a few key figures, such as Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Wu Zhihui, who, when they were living in France in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), sent letters to encourage the founding of our Society upon hearing about it. Later, Mr. Liang Qichao, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, Mr. Wang Jingwei, and Mr. Sun Zhesheng also made significant contributions in various aspects of spiritual and material support. Over the years, countless friends from all walks of life have supported our Society with money or books. We dare to say that without the deep sympathy and encouragement of society, there would be no Society today, which we should always remember.</p>
<p>(2) Efforts of Members. From the very beginning, our Society has relied on the efforts and struggles of each member as the only way to survive. I remember when my deceased friend Yang Xingfo was the editor-in-chief of "Science" magazine in the United States, he often used humorous poems to ask Zhao Yuanren for articles. Mr. Zhao replied with a poem saying, "Since Ken Bo left, this city is like scalding soup, the article has been sent, I dare not be worthy. (Yang's original poem had the line 'Tell Mr. Zhao, Science needs articles') Just finished and have to do it again, busy like the King of Hell. (Original note: Work like hell) Fortunately, there is a picnic, at that time we can have a great time." One can imagine the atmosphere at that time. Also, Mr. Hu Mingfu, with his extraordinary talent and learning, stayed in Shanghai for the sake of science, willing to die and not leave. Later, when the research institute was established, even more people devoted themselves to research. For example, Mr. Bing Nongshan and Mr. Qian Yunong, without winter, without summer, without weekdays, without day or night, whenever you went to the research institute, you would see these gentlemen buried in their work. To this day, the staff inside and outside the Society are still working diligently and tirelessly, which is a manifestation of this spirit.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two factors, we believe that there is another more important driving force that has driven sponsors outside the Society and staff inside the Society to work together to develop science, that is, scientific truth is as vast as the sea, and all cultured humans have an obligation to search for its hidden treasures. Moreover, the competition for survival is becoming increasingly fierce, and the prosperity of a nation is directly proportional to its achievements in discovering these treasures. This truth is clearly before us, and whether we admire or doubt science, we cannot deny it. Moreover, with unprecedented national crises approaching, we must regard the study of science as an important way to solve national problems. Therefore, our efforts over the past twenty years are not enough to satisfy us, and we must continue to strive for even greater contributions. Isn't this obvious? Isn't this obvious? We sincerely hope that on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Society, we can use this idea to congratulate the Society and encourage our colleagues working inside and outside the Society. The Founding and Present of the China Science Society By Yang Xiaoshu</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, China was still in an era of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application." The so-called science in the country was just a decoration in school curricula, and there was no spirit or fashion of scientific research at all. It was still a few students studying abroad who, witnessing the prosperity of European and American civilization, felt that science was the main driving force of modern culture and that to revitalize China, one had to start by working hard on science to be effective. Between the second and third years of the Republic of China (1913-1914), some Chinese students studying at Cornell University in the United States, recognizing the lack of science and the decline of industry in their motherland, wanted to create a science magazine to promote it. After advocating for a long time, they finally held a meeting on June 10th of the third year of the Republic of China (1914) and decided to establish a "Science Society" with a joint-stock nature as an organization to publish science magazines. Each share was set at five US dollars, and shareholders had the responsibility to write articles. Ren Hongjun, Zhou Ren, Bing Zhi, Hu Mingfu, and Zhao Yuanren were elected as directors, and Yang Quan was appointed as the head of the editorial department. In addition, there were titles such as business director and promotion director, and the play of running a science magazine began from then on.</p>
<p>After three months of editorial work, the first batch of manuscripts was entrusted to manager Huang Boqin to be taken to Shanghai for publication. At that time, it happened to be the beginning of the European War. Seeing that the situation was not good, he almost stopped publishing. However, the enthusiastic members in the United States decided to persevere to the end. Later, Zhu Shaoping was invited to serve as the manager, and the first issue of "Science" was surprisingly born on the mainland of China on New Year's Day of the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915). The content can be said to be all-inclusive, but because it adopted horizontal writing and added Western symbols and punctuation, there were quite a few criticisms at home and abroad for being needlessly novel. However, the editors of "Science" were determined and confident, believing that scientific writing should be clear and unambiguous. Many profound and new meanings did not exist in China, and if long and lengthy articles were not punctuated, it was feared that there would be countless errors in meaning due to sentence structure. Member Hu Shi expressed sympathy and wrote an article on punctuation and writing symbols, which was published in Volume 2, Issue 1 of "Science" as a response. Therefore, "Science" can be regarded as the pioneer in adopting modern punctuation in domestic books and newspapers.</p>
<p>Publishing a magazine every month also required printing costs. It was pitiful that these young people, while studying, stole time to do editorial work and still had to raise funds. The limited share capital was of no use, and they had to tighten their belts and pay what was then called a special monthly donation. Among them, there were many enthusiastic individuals who only used a glass of cold water and a stack of bread with some peanut butter for their three meals every day, hiding in their rooms to fill their stomachs. Besides this, what other ways could they think of?</p>
<p>Not long after "Science" was published, the members felt that the purpose of the Science Society was to revitalize science and promote industry, and that a mere periodical would not be enough to achieve this goal. Zou Shuwen formally proposed to change the Science Society into a national academic society. The board of directors then sent letters to all shareholders to ask for their opinions, and unanimous approval was obtained. In June of the fourth year (1915), the board of directors appointed Ren Hongjun, Hu Mingfu, and Zou Bingwen as drafters of the new society's general charter, and the Science Society was renamed the China Science Society. The charter was passed by all members on October 25th of that year. From then on, the China Science Society was formally established, and the existence of a scientific society in China must be regarded as starting from this. At the time of the reorganization, there were a total of one hundred and fifteen members, of whom eight percent were still studying abroad.</p>
<p>In March of the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), it was approved by the Ministry of Education to be registered. The undertakings that the Society should undertake, as listed in the official document at that time, were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Publish magazines to disseminate science and promote research. (2) Translate and write scientific books. (3) Compile and standardize scientific terms to make them uniform and convenient for readers. (4) Establish a library for scholars to refer to. (5) Establish various research institutes to conduct scientific experiments to promote progress in academics, industry, and public welfare. (6) Establish a museum to collect specimens of academic, industrial, historical, and natural animal, plant, and mineral objects, and display them for research. (7) Hold scientific lectures to popularize scientific knowledge. (8) Organize inspection teams for on-site scientific investigation and research. (9) Accept commissions from companies and institutions to study and solve all problems related to science.</p>
<p>Seeing the undertakings listed above, the purpose of the Society is self-evident. In the summer of the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), the general headquarters of the Society moved from the United States to China and set up an office at Datong University in Shanghai. At the same time, a branch was established in Nanjing, right across from the Yizi Room of Nanjing Higher Normal School. A sign was hung at the door of a small room, and several magazines were displayed inside, which served as the meeting place for members and the office of the branch.</p>
<p>In November of the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919), we surprisingly received the official property in Wende Lane, Chengxian Street, Nanjing, from the Ministry of Finance to be used as the Society's premises. Everyone was so happy that they were in a flurry of activity. To maintain the new premises, we had to resort to the old method of implementing special monthly donations. The library preparatory committee, which had been established for four or five years, naturally became active after having a building. The Society elected Hu Gangfu as the director of the library, and on the one hand, they solicited books from members for deposit, and on the other hand, they planned to raise some funds to purchase new books. In August of the ninth year (1920), the Science Library was finally established, but it was very simple. Therefore, it was not officially opened to the public until January of the eleventh year (1922), when there were only more than 5,000 books and more than 1,000 magazines.</p>
<p>While conducting the organization of the library, we also initiated the preparation of the research institute, because even if we were poor, we still had to do things. According to our original plan, we wanted to establish five research institutes—physics and chemistry, biology, hygiene, mining and metallurgy, and special—and two museums—natural history and industrial and commercial products—each set up in Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, and Guangzhou according to their nature. Because biology is the most regional, and Nanjing already had existing buildings, it was decided to first establish the Institute of Biology, hoping that it would cost less and yield quicker results. At that time, members such as Bing Zhi and Hu Xiansu were teaching at Southeast University, so they were invited to plan the implementation and to take charge of animal and plant research in their spare time. On August 15th of the eleventh year (1922), an opening ceremony was held, which was the beginning of private organizations establishing research institutes in China. At that time, funds were scarce, and the equipment was naturally very simple. It was not until the following year that the animal and plant departments each received a monthly funding of 150 yuan to slightly equip themselves with instruments and collect specimens. But the spirit was good. In addition to research, an exhibition hall was opened downstairs for people to visit. The existence of a natural history museum in Nanjing began from this. By the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), the animal and plant departments had published five research papers based on the results of the institute, which were sent to specialized academic institutions around the world to exchange publications. The research work of the Society began to be noticed by scholars all over the world.</p>
<p>The above is my recollection of the establishment of the Society and the founding of some of the larger undertakings. As for the current level of development, I must also briefly describe it, but first, I must establish a standard for comparison. In the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916), our president, Ren Hongjun, had the following dream in his opening speech at the first annual meeting:</p>
<p>"The progress of science cannot be achieved by writing a few articles or saying a few empty words. It must be done by hard work in the practice field. If you gentlemen think that my words are not entirely wrong, I would like to invite you gentlemen to take a short dream and take a look at the future meeting place of the China Science Society. This meeting place is built in a place with beautiful scenery and convenient transportation in China. The appearance is not very luxurious, but the inside is spacious and deep, probably not inferior to the new school buildings of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. There is a library and a museum. The rest are divided into different departments, with dozens of laboratories set up. Many of the Society's most knowledgeable members are invited to study the unsolved problems of scientists in the world in the laboratories according to Bacon's method. The periodicals and books published by the Society are not only reference books for schools, but also the basis for various scientific researches. How many years will it take from the current China Science Society to our imagined Science Society? It all depends on the enthusiasm of our members and the public spirit of the society."</p>
<p>We have had a long dream for twenty years. How far is the current achievement from the ideal? We still have to review it in the dream. As for the meeting place, there are only five or six houses in Nanjing and Shanghai, which are much smaller than the school buildings of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, there are now 30,000 to 40,000 reference books in the library, and more than 300 kinds of scientific periodicals from various countries, bought and exchanged, and dozens of complete old magazines that are less than 100 years old and more than 30 or 40 years old are also treasured. There is only one department of biology in the research institute. One is that there is no funding to add other types, and the other is that research institutions in China have sprung up like mushrooms after rain in the past four or five years. We can also take a break. There are also more than a dozen laboratories. In addition to the two major departments of animal and plant, there are also several laboratories for biological chemistry and physiology. Of course, there are many knowledgeable members inside who are applying Bacon's method. Speaking of periodicals, in addition to the Science Monthly, which was fought for with cold water and bread and has not been interrupted, there is also a semi-monthly science newspaper with a purely popular nature. In terms of books, only the Science Series, Science Industry Books, and General Theory, etc., can be used as textbooks for schools, but there are many that can be used as the basis for scientific research. In addition to the papers read by members in the annual meeting every year, the Institute of Biology publishes 30 to 40 papers every year. Academic institutions in more than 700 places around the world exchange publications with this kind of paper. Therefore, the Society is not only one of the important research institutions in China, but has also been valued by the international academic community for a long time. In terms of publishing, the Society also founded a China Science Book and Instrument Company, which not only prints all publications by itself, but also strives to compile and translate scientific books and operate the business of instruments and specimens.</p>
<p>In addition to the several undertakings mentioned above, the Society has made its greatest efforts to review and approve scientific terms. It began to work on it at the beginning of the publication of "Science". Since the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919), it has participated in the Chinese Science Terminology Review Committee. The formulation of terms in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology is mostly done by members of the Society, and it was not completed until the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929). Regarding science education, in addition to setting up a science education committee to investigate the scientific equipment and teaching materials in secondary schools in order to improve them, the Society's Institute of Biology also actively assists the research work of science teachers in secondary schools to enhance their teaching abilities. A column on science teaching materials is also specially set up in the Science Pictorial for use by primary and secondary schools. The Society also holds public lectures from time to time, either for the general public or specifically for middle school teachers. Since the nineteenth year (1930), in accordance with the will of the central government, a scientific advisory office has been established. Whenever people from all walks of life encounter scientific problems and come to the Society for consultation, expert members will answer them on their behalf. There are five or six hundred cases every year. There is also one thing worth remembering, that is, participating in international scientific conferences. Before the establishment of the Academia Sinica, for all such conferences, the international community recognized the Society as the official representative of China. For example, the Third Pan-Pacific Science Conference in November of the fifteenth year (1926) and the Fourth Pan-Pacific Science Conference in May of the eighteenth year (1929) were all attended by representatives of the Society on behalf of China.</p>
<p>Over the past twenty years, we have been constantly receiving material and spiritual assistance from the government and society, whether it is funds, annual fees, special donations, or rewards. We are very grateful. The number of members has reached more than 1,800, all of whom take the development of science as their own responsibility. Among them, there are many who devote themselves to the Society and spend their lives on it. However, our achievements today are still far from the Royal Society of England or the Smithsonian Institution in Mr. Ren's dream. In this world of scientific competition, where the weak are prey to the strong, how can our Chinese nation save itself from danger and how can it ascend to the world's academic community? When I say this, I am only afraid. The enlightened gentlemen at home and abroad who expect the China Science Society to do well must have the same feeling. The China Science Society and the Chinese Cultural Movement in the Past Twenty Years By Lu Yu Dao</p>
<p>The China Science Society is entirely a freely assembled group of Chinese scientists. Its purpose is neither political, nor religious, nor economic, but entirely to save the endangered motherland with science. Since its inception in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915) until October 25th of this year (1934), it has reached the age of twenty. All of us members feel that although we have not been able to develop as we had hoped in our ideals during these twenty years, we have not wasted our years. To make friends inside and outside the Society acknowledge this statement, we will try to briefly review the work of our Society and the Chinese cultural movement in the past twenty years.</p>
<p>1. The New Culture Movement in the Past Twenty Years</p>
<p>Twenty years ago was exactly the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915). The Xinhai Revolution had temporarily come to an end, and Kang and Liang's new learning had spread throughout the country. Following this was the New Culture Movement, such as the publication of new magazines such as "New China" and "Transformation". The most popular and influential of these was "New Youth", whose main purpose was to promote Westernization. In politics, it advocated democracy, and in academics, it advocated scientific thought. It also included the vernacular movement and the anti-Confucius movement. Of course, it can be said that it was entirely a reaction to the Xinhai Revolution's failure to immediately make China rich and strong on the surface. Just look at Hongxian's称帝 (Yuan Shikai's attempt to restore the monarchy) and Zhang and Lu's selling out of the country, which led to Sun Yat-sen's second revolution and the May Fourth Movement, and you can know. The core members of "New Youth" were Chen Duxiu and Hu Shih, so their remarks can represent the ideological center of the time. Mr. Chen Duxiu said: "To uphold Mr. De (Democracy), we must oppose Confucianism, chastity, old ethics, and old politics; to uphold Mr. Sai (Science), we must oppose old art and old religion; to uphold Mr. De and Mr. Sai, we must oppose national essence and old literature." Mr. Hu Shih also said: "I very impolitely criticize our Eastern civilization and very enthusiastically praise Western modern civilization." He also said: "If we still want to rectify this country, if we still hope that this nation will occupy a place in the world, there is only one way to survive, that is, we ourselves must admit our mistakes. We must admit that we are inferior to others in everything; not only are we inferior to others in material machines, not only are we inferior to others in political systems, but also in morality, literature, music, art, and physical fitness." It can be seen that the most important task at that time was destruction. Unfortunately, as a result, democratic politics did not achieve its goal, and scientific thought did not succeed universally.</p>
<p>From then on, the publishing industry became lively. Philosophical works such as Hu Shih's "Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy", Liang Shuming's "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies"; literary works such as the Creation Society's novels, essays by professors at Yenching University, the Zhou brothers, and translations of social thought were all very popular for a time. At that time, many authors compared it to the Western Renaissance. In reality, China still did not reach the threshold of wealth and strength, and the New Culture still did not establish success. Society—especially young students—instead presented a decadent image in morality and thought. The recent New Life Movement and the declaration of the construction of local culture cannot but be admitted as a response to saving current malpractices.</p>
<p>2. A Cultural Movement Centered on Science</p>
<p>If we look closely at the articles by Chen and Hu quoted above, their goal was indeed democracy, science, and Westernization, but unfortunately, the direction of their efforts was too biased towards destruction. If we want to build a new culture in China, the first thing we need is to scientize social life, and the second thing we need is to scientize academic thought. Therefore, I call it a cultural movement centered on science, which is the only lifeline for rectifying the motherland and revitalizing the nation. And the characteristics of modern Western civilization are all in the word science. Believing in Confucianism, keeping chastity, retaining old ethics, old politics (referring to systems), old art, old religion, old national essence, and old literature, it doesn't matter at all, as long as there is science; even if you don't eat big dishes, don't wear Western suits, don't drive cars, and don't live in Western houses, it's okay, as long as there is science. Only knowing how to take the train but not knowing that the train is a gift of science, only knowing how to Westernize and pay attention to hygiene but not knowing that hygiene is a scientific principle, I ask, can this kind of culture save China? Can it revitalize the nation?</p>
<p>If our country's economy goes bankrupt, we have to relieve the countryside. The way to relieve the countryside is to build water conservancy, eliminate pests, and make production technology scientific. If our country wants to reduce imports, we have to develop industry. All machine manufacturing and cotton weaving improvements cannot be successful without knowledge and application of scientific technology. If agricultural and industrial products are to circulate, we have to reorganize transportation, such as trains and highways. Therefore, technical talents and mechanical materials have to be cultivated and supplied as much as possible. Even to avenge national humiliation and resist foreign insults, we have to scientize the national army, soldiers, and military affairs. All of this is the scientization of life. Also, although our country has more than 400 million people, there are too many deaths and diseases, too low intelligence, too short lives, and too weak physiques. We have to teach them how to preserve their health. All romantic, humorous, decadent, and complacent thoughts should be replaced with positive, regular, and health-preserving thoughts. Even the theory of survival of the fittest in Darwin's theory of evolution, all young people should be familiar with it, so that they understand that the country cannot survive without competition. All of this is the scientization of thought.</p>
<p>I believe that cultural activists in society who are aware of this and follow this path, in another twenty years, China will not fail to become a modern, rich, and strong country. What is this path? One word runs through it all: science!</p>
<p>3. The Efforts of the China Science Society in the Past Twenty Years.</p>
<p>In the middle of this cultural movement in the past twenty years, those who have buried their heads in work, have not boasted loudly, but have actually been a lifeline for cultural construction, are the continuous efforts of the China Science Society. The work of the Society in the past twenty years has been recorded in this newspaper, and readers can refer to it. However, the significance of this kind of effort cannot but be said to have been recognized by the majority of people in the country until recently. To put it bluntly, this kind of effort has two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Popularizing Science. Because Chinese learning fundamentally lacks science, because Chinese culture also fundamentally lacks science, and because Chinese national power fundamentally lacks science, we have to disseminate scientific methods and content to all parts of China as far as the Society can. Therefore, first, there is the publication of "Science" magazine, so that it can carry papers on scientific aspects. Recently, feeling that the Chinese masses lack scientific knowledge too much, and that the Science Monthly cannot reach them, we also published the Science Pictorial. The promotion of these two has been increasing recently. The writers are not seeking fame, and the operators are not seeking profit. They are completely fulfilling the duty and responsibility of saving the country through science. I hope that readers of this newspaper and the Science Monthly can understand and appreciate this point. This is one of the Society's efforts.</p>
<p>(2) Studying Science. However, science is changing rapidly, and we cannot catch up with the advanced countries of the world without running a library and a laboratory to study. Especially the laboratory, because scientific research cannot be obtained by reading books and newspapers, we must directly work with our hands and look with our eyes to contact nature. Limited by manpower and financial resources, the Society first established the Institute of Biology in Nanjing. Under the leadership of Mr. Bing Nongshan, it has worked hard for more than ten years, and the results have been comparable to those of biology in various countries in the world. Domestically, it was the first to establish a well-equipped private research institute. This is the second effort of the Society.</p>
<p>The participation of science in Chinese culture is the success of the systematic and vigorous advocacy of the Society. Although the Society is not the only contributor, it is one of the most hardworking. As for the real scientific research work in China, in the field of biology, the Society is quite proud to be the first advocate. The Society believes that these two are things that are always present and constantly advancing in the Chinese cultural movement, even though they are not publicized.</p>
<p>4. Extravagant Hopes for the Future</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly talk about our extravagant hopes. What do we hope for? That is, recognition and support from people in society and government authorities. The Society's members have the intelligence, but lack the financial resources; the Society's members are good at working hard, but lack clever solutions. Therefore, we hope that people in society and government authorities will always keep the Society in mind. In addition to continuously providing the financial resources needed by the staff, they can also remember to treat the Society as a good friend, so that the Society can contact every corner of society, establish relationships, and have opportunities given and obstacles removed. Wouldn't this be the good fortune of the Society, the good fortune of Chinese science, and the good fortune of Chinese culture!</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>Since the Gold Standard Future Market opened on October 16th for the December term, it has been pushed up by major players. The closing price reached 926 yuan. However, by yesterday (the 24th), the closing price was 1062 yuan. In nine days, the price rose by 136 yuan. Yesterday's surge was the most significant, with a one-day increase of 70.5 yuan. The highest price was seen last October when the equalization tax was levied. Afterwards, it fell back to 1025 yuan. The lowest price this year was in the 700s. Traditionally, the Gold Standard Future price is usually suppressed by 40 to 70 yuan below the standard gold price. Since last week, it has risen by more than 10 yuan. Yesterday, it exceeded the standard gold price by 100 yuan. The sharp rise is evident here. The Customs Gold Unit price is 1.909 yuan. If, as speculators hope, the Customs Gold Unit price reaches 2.5 yuan, then the Gold Standard Future price will rise to around 1290 yuan. Also, the price of gold jewelry rose by 7 yuan in one day, reaching 109.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, HSBC has revised its exchange rates twice in the past two days, and it did so again yesterday. First, the spot rate was reduced by 0.75, the US dollar by 1.5 yuan, and the Japanese yen by 5.5 yuan. Some say that if Sino-Japanese trade cooperation is realized, will the currency system also cooperate? Others say that if the British pound falls to 1 shilling and 2 pence, it will be tricky. However, yesterday the four-day forward rate opened at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 0.125. The distance is not far. In short, if the price of gold is raised so wildly without thinking of saving it, it will ultimately not be a blessing. Everyone is bullish on foreign exchange, so the London market often sees China selling and buying paper while exporting silver. "You won't give up until you see the Yellow River, and it's too late when you see the Yellow River." Please consider it carefully.</p>
<p>Due to the rise in gold prices and the high exchange rates, all goods related to the word "foreign" have risen. Cotton yarn rose by more than 4 yuan, already exceeding 180 yuan. Cotton rose by 1.23 yuan, reaching a high of 36.67 yuan. Flour and wheat futures also rose with the price of gold. If this continues, I don't know what to do with the general livelihood. Financial Crisis Is Difficult to Control The Gold Standard Future Market Rises Even More Wildly New Highest Price 1087 Yuan Alarming Increase of 70 Yuan and 5 Jiao 100 Yuan Higher Than the Standard Gold Price</p>
<p>The gold market suddenly experienced an unprecedented surge yesterday. The industry has no clear target. The shorts are like frightened birds, terrified and trembling, with no resistance. There are various rumors. The extent of positive news is even greater than before. Generally, they are following the trend, presenting a single-track front. The waves are滔天 (滔天 means monstrous), and the surge is close to 100 yuan, creating a new high price of 1087 yuan, which is 100 yuan higher than the standard gold price. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed no change in both the UK and the US. The forward silver price in Monte Carlo also lacked change. Exchange rates were generally up. The London spot gold price fell by 2.5 pence. The local sentiment was unaffected. Rumors circulated that the after-hours trading overnight had already risen to 1010 yuan. Sentiment was even more bullish. The industry was茫然 (茫然 means at a loss), not knowing what to do. Pre-market trading opened, initially calling out 1067 yuan. There was a buying spree in the market, with a lack of supply. Shen Feng, Fu Xing, and Yong Yi Cheng all advanced, rising to 17 or 18 yuan. Heng Yu, Zheng Chang, Fu Xing, Yong Hui Xiang once sold to 12 or 13 yuan. Yi Cheng, Da De Cheng, Shen Feng, Wan Feng, Da Da, and Ding Kang then advanced to 22 or 23 yuan. Li Chang and Heng Yu took advantage of the high price to settle at 19 yuan. Da De Cheng, Shen Feng, Fu Xing, Yong, etc. advanced again, rising to 31 or 32 yuan. Heng Yu came to sell, falling below 30 yuan. After the opening, there was a temporary decline, but the buying power of major players was extremely strong. The upward trend was激越 (激越 means intense), successively breaking through the two major barriers of 30 and 40 yuan. The foreign exchange market was extremely tight. The official exchange rate of the Central Bank had not yet been announced. People were panicked, approaching the 50 yuan mark. The official exchange rate of the Central Bank was announced. The Customs Gold Unit only rose by 1 cent. The standard Gold Standard Future price only rose to 966.4 yuan. Major players took advantage of the high price to sell contracts. The long positions were sold off. Banks were jammed. The downward trend was strong, once approaching the 30 yuan mark. However, HSBC's official exchange rate was greatly reduced. The buying interest was easily ignited. Major players still advanced. Reuters reported that Hong Kong had a proposal to immediately prohibit the export of Hong Kong silver dollars. The upward trend was even stronger, rising to 1055 yuan. Banks were still jammed. The Hong Kong market was hardened. There was a pullback of 10 yuan, but the phenomenon of demand exceeding supply was very obvious, making it easy to raise prices. Although the forecast for Indian silver was only a small anna, it still rose to above the 50 yuan mark at noon. After the closing, it rose again to above 70 yuan. The after-market was even more 급急 (急 means urgent) due to rumors that currency inflation had been passed. The upper market once rose to 80 yuan, and then fell slightly. After the opening, it was rumored that the exchange was increasing the special handling fees. The buying interest was衝天 (衝天 means soaring), and the buyers surged, following the trend, rising to a new high of 1087 yuan. Banks and the Central Bank took advantage of the high</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Standing Directors and Supervisors of the Flood Relief Association Held Yesterday</h3>

<p>Lu Bohong's Letter</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, I am writing to acknowledge receipt of the 130,000 yuan telegraphed by your association to Shandong, as previously reported. I immediately consulted with the local relief agencies to determine the distribution method based on the severity of the disaster. I am now reporting the details of the process as follows: (1) There are a total of 25 shelters in Jinan, housing approximately 16,000 disaster victims. 40,000 yuan has been allocated for relief. (2) In the ten disaster-stricken counties, there are shelters housing approximately 270,000 disaster victims. 60,000 yuan has been allocated for supplementary relief. (3) Two disaster victim hospitals have been established in Jinan: the First Hospital and the Second Hospital. The monthly expenses for the First Hospital are 1,400 yuan, totaling 8,400 yuan for six months, plus 1,000 yuan for initial setup costs, totaling 9,400 yuan. The Second Hospital receives a monthly subsidy of 500 yuan, totaling 3,000 yuan for six months, plus 600 yuan for initial setup costs, totaling 3,600 yuan. (4) Three disaster victim hospitals have been established in Jining, Caozhou, and Juye, each with monthly expenses of 800 yuan, totaling 2,400 yuan for the three locations. For six months, the expenses are 14,400 yuan, plus initial setup costs of 900 yuan per month for each location, totaling 2,700 yuan for the three locations, for a total of 17,100 yuan. The total cost for the five hospitals mentioned above is 30,100 yuan. Regarding the distribution of relief funds: (1) The 40,000 yuan for the Jinan shelters has been allocated as agreed upon, and the Jinan Municipal Government is responsible for distribution. Representatives from our association will visit each shelter from time to time to inspect and prevent abuses. (2) The 60,000 yuan for the shelters in the ten disaster-stricken counties has been entrusted to the Shandong Provincial Relief Association for responsible distribution, based on the severity of the disaster, due to the inconvenient transportation and complex situation in the disaster areas, and the insufficient number of personnel in our association. Funds will be sent separately, while our association will send personnel to conduct on-site investigations and report the details in due course. (3) The First Hospital in Jinan was originally a newly established orphanage for disaster-stricken children with inadequate facilities and a high mortality rate. Our association has assigned personnel to take charge of management and has requested five nuns from the local Catholic Church hospital to provide voluntary services, including diagnosis and nursing. The conditions are gradually improving. However, the hospital can only accommodate 170 to 180 patients, but the number of patients is increasing daily, and the hospital is overcrowded. The Second Hospital is a hospital originally established by the Dongguan Catholic Church in Jinan. The Shandong Association has added 100 beds, and nuns from the hospital are also providing voluntary services. It is currently full. (4) Mr. Wan Binlai, a Catholic priest who has a long-standing reputation for outstanding disaster relief work and is highly respected in the area, has been asked to be responsible for the preparations for the hospitals in Jining, Caozhou, and Juye. Progress is currently underway, and further details will be reported later. This is the current state of work. I am submitting this report and hope for your review and guidance, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
