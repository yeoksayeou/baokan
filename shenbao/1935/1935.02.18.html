<p>時評</p>
<h3>英法倫敦議定書與德國</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>據昨日歐電。德國對於英法倫敦議定書之覆文。已正式發表。按英法倫敦談話所議定者。即在訂立四種公約。（一）天空公約。（二）軍縮公約。（三）中歐公約。（四）東歐公約。同時更邀德國復返國聯。惟就德國今次對於英法議定書之覆文觀這。除贊同天空公約外。對於軍縮公約。仍持對法平等之態度。而於中歐東歐公約問題。復返國聯問題。則幾於一字不提。足見德國對於西歐。雖已放棄其領土發展之雄心。而於中歐東。則仍不能全然忘情也。</p>
<p>德國放棄其向西發展之雄心。乃爲極自然之結果。蓋德若向此進行。則必邀英法之聯合行動。而鮮有倖勝之可能。故希特勒於薩爾投票之前夕。甑胃薩爾若能歸德。則德法間更無土地之糾紛。其意固非僅在示歡於法也。最近倫敦談話之結果。英法更有締結天空公約之擬議。一旦成爲事實。則自洛迦諾以來西歐之對德防綫。可以更能鞏固。蓋該約之擬議。原出於英人對德之疑懼。亦爲英法恊調之進一步的表現。今洛迦諾公約之其他簽字國。皆已先後同意於此。德人再不接受。不啻反證其有襲擊英法天空之野心。反之。如能隨衆附和。不獨可紓英人之疑懼。即共自身受人襲擊之時。亦可獲得公約之保障。且德國此一行動。當能獲取英人之滿意。由是而減輕英法恊調之力量。亦意中事。故德國今次之行動。實爲權衡利害必然之結果。</p>
<p>至於中歐東歐之發展。德國似尚不欲全然放棄。推其用意。或則確在擇一相當時期。謀此二方發展。或則並非真有野心於此二方。特欲於談判之際。留一討價還價之餘地。所謂中歐問題。當以不干涉奧國獨立問題爲核心。德國於此前曾向意有所探詢。前日歐電。亦謂德國主張奧國採取何種政制。（或竟採取國社黨之政制。）應任其自決。觀此可知德國對於德奧合併之態度。實質上仍無多大改變也。奧人對於此次薩爾投票之歸德。莫不歡欣鼓舞。如向來反對國社黨之奧國國家報。亦謂「薩爾者德人之薩爾也。其應復歸德國。即法人亦不能不予以承認。」可知德奧雖分立。而大日耳曼主義之精神。固無時不存在。此種精神一日不消減。則兩國一時雖未能合併。終有實行合併之可能性。德國身當其境。豈能淡然忘情。至於東歐方面。觀於最近德國國社黨在麥末爾之連續活動。可知其關懷之深切。加之斯拉夫系之波蘭。正與蘇俄爭斯拉夫民族之領導權。對俄野心。無時或已。德國獲此同志。深喜吾道不孤。故其謝絕參加東歐公約之飾辭。一則曰俄德壞土不相接。無締結此約之必要。再則曰東歐公約爲軍事事同盟性質。德國不欲有所參加。實則德國若與波蘭合作。即可侵俄。至對波羅的海各國之侵略。則有東普士之根據地。更可遊刃有餘也。</p>
<p>就我人觀察。德國今日或不致遽存向中歐東歐發展之奢望。特以國社黨歷來之宣傳。悉以德奧合併收回失地擴張領土實現大日耳曼主義等項爲標榜。今若驟然訂立違反此種政策之公約。恐將引起國內之非難。故特避免不談。留爲將來談判時討價還價之地步。蓋事實上。德若不參加此等公約。則法俄法意之間。或將更有進一步之結合。未必能有利於德。故若非別有作用。殊不必拒絕不談也。唯問題之重心。尚在英法。英之目光。若純注於西歐。則英法之步調。自難一致。再則法國獲得英人恊調之後。對俄倚仗之情。是否一如往日。無所變遷。亦爲重要之關鍵。總之國際間之錯綜關係。究將如何演變。將於今後英法會談之結果覘之矣。</p>

<h3>日本通常會議之形形色色</h3>
<p>議會政治毫無生氣</p>
<p>岡田內閣大失人望</p>
<p>議會政治之於日本、九一八事變後、已名存寶亡、大有恢復舊時閥閱專政之傾向、但以日本資本完全成熟、軍人雖意氣飛颺、亦不能不接愛近代政治組織準則、故軍部權威尚有一定限定、暫時不致越出當軌也、因軍部高倡非常時期、所謂「國難」當前、應實行「舉國一致」之結果、立憲政治上政黨運用、遂全失作用、讓軍部獨行期是、緣日本政治組織、自明治維新以來、民主運動漸次抬頭、而見諸實際活動者、其開始厥爲原敬氏以平民（無爵位）而任閣揆、當時歐戰方終、和平空氣彌漫世界、軍部開拓野心、亦不能不略爲收檢、其對立憲政治讓步、殆爲時勢所必然耳、</p>
<p>最近國際間軍備競爭已成公開之秘密、而「經濟同盟」尤爲主要諸國之國是、日本軍部更乘勢弄潮、對外既建立稀世之大功、對內猶慊未能得志、是以擬借一九三五三六年國際危機之說、激動其國民、即以人民之力壓倒議會、惟元老重臣、如西園寺公望·牧野伸顯·以迄高橋是清·若櫬禮次郎·鈴木喜三郎諸人、均一力擁護立憲政治、至少必維持現狀、西園寺爲明治維新以來碩果、僅存之唯一元老、運用於少壯派軍人元老及政黨之間、使海軍耆宿當國、希國將來扶持憲政進入常軌、不意政黨污點愈見擴大、黨系之爭又不可免、政黨信用因此掃地、軍部於是抬頭、非常時期日見加緊、議會政治竟等裝飾品矣、</p>
<p>去臘六十六次臨時議會一般與經論暗中左袒議會而右軍部、第一大政黨頗有取岡田內閣以自代之可能、而政友會與民政黨之聯合、更表示大財閥一致努力以限制軍部之發展、然政黨實力不足、聯合陣缐又不穩固、保持議會常態、當無問題、欲圖恢復政黨以往勢力、事實則有所不許、而政友會以最大多數黨竟不能組閣、甚至不能左右議會、其初尚以爲與論所趨、軍部所限、不敢輕於征取政主、臨時議會開會之初、與論對政黨漸次表示好意、而政友會與農村開係密切、是以決定一面買好農村、一面試探民間空氣、東武氏之「爆彈動議」——增加一萬八千萬元預算之提案、由是而興、諜知岡田內閣拉高橋是清入長財政之後、第二流內閣變而爲一流內閣、假使政友會堅持其提案、難免不遭解散、歸於失敗、</p>
<p>六十七次議會開幕以後、仍無多大精彩爆彈動議、之暗礁依然存在、議會中占二百六十一議席之政友會與岡田內閣仍舊處於相反地位、立於倒閣與解散之岐途、無論任何方面均無必死之決心、同時亦不肯作殊死之政治爭門、蓋現內閣名爲非常時舉國一致內閣、但於政黨並無實際的政治運用、解散議會以後、在政友會方面現時處於反政府地位、將來亦無組閣之可能、則被解散後如何再選、如何運用政略、均毫無把握、所謂左右爲難是也、結果祇有於走頭無路之中、勉強尋求妥恊轉圖之法而已、</p>
<p>岡田內閣提出第二預備金一千五百萬元之追加預算、以爲救濟農村窮乏之補助、借此敷衍政友會顏面、亦即表示政府之妥恊態度、在政友會中之強硬派並不認爲滿足、而調和派則以爲可借此收塲、以免將來之意外變遷、同時更借一九二八年床次（現在遞信大臣）遊東北時曾受中國當地最高當局五十萬元事、以作口實竭力攻擊政府、致岡田內閣立腳不固、對政黨遷就、亦未可知、不過岡田原非政黨出身、床次卻與政黨有深切關係、此事推演結束、岡田內閣固人失人望、政黨亦將愈蒙不利、終至於軍人得勢、議會政治更見頹落而已、（二月七日於東京）</p>
<h3>于學忠與儀我會商戰區問題</h3>
<p>新保安隊入戰區</p>
<p>日方祇允五千名</p>
<p>北平通信、「戰區」問題、截至今（十六）日止、關於解決途徑、確已由雙方商定、該問題中之新編保安隊開入「戰區」一項、將首先實現、其人數與攜帶武器種類、雖曾一度傳稱爲九千名、但至昨（十五）晨、經日關東軍代表儀我誠也·與河北省府主席于學忠、在北平辛寺胡同五十一軍駐平辦公處會談後、人數仍爲五千名、所攜武器、除步槍外、得附輕機槍五十挺、聞儀我於商定人數及武器問題後、曾聲稱日方得隨時檢查輕機槍數目、當經于氏答稱、隨時檢查、似嫌煩瑣、且不便處甚多、主張在新保安隊開進「戰區」、中日雙方會同檢查一次、較爲簡㨗、儀我旋表示接受、于氏嗣談及保安隊攜輕機槍入「戰區」、旨在維持治安、鎮懾匪患、絕非對日有何表示、此則日方應予同情、儀我繼表示、「戰區」內將來萬一有大股匪患、如認有必要時、中國方面、得隨時於徵得日方同意後、即運輸大砲應用、亦無不可、惟預先聲明、用畢即須運回、會談至此乃告終、儀我當日下午一時十五分、離平赴津、轉往長春向日關東軍長官南次郎覆命、據于學忠是日語記者、新保安隊開㧞期、因諸待準備、故頃尚未預定、該五千名將編爲兩總隊、總隊長人選、省府年前於編隊時、委定張硯田·張慶餘·二人充任、將來擬令張硯田部駐灤榆區、張慶餘部駐薊密區、駐紥地與人數之配置、胥視地方情形而定、例如某地方無匪氛、即可不必派駐、反言之、某地方如匪氛不靖、則駐隊人數、不妨多些、以應需要、新保安隊原編爲九千名、今既祇需五千名、餘四千名、將分別歸還建制或予資遣云云、（十六日）</p>
<h3>日人在廈舉動</h3>
<p>百武南游有重大任務</p>
<p>日臺人儼然另一組織</p>
<p>廈門通信、日本外遣第三艦隊、由司令官海軍中將百武源吾、統率九艦、六日到廈、九日赴粵、百武去廈後、第五水雷隊司令海軍少將下村正助、乘龍田巡洋艦尚留廈、下村連日與各界往還極密、據熟知日方情況者消息、百武此次南行、所負任務、極爲重大、非僅尋常游弋、普通酬酢、初到廈時、分訪政商各界、陳敘其對中日問題意見、又謂一二八之役、係屬誤會、就現在國際情勢論、中日應親善合作、共同努力對外、庶可保東亞和平云云、惟對東北四省問題、則一字不提、至下村則定於明（十七）日乘龍田艦反馬公、聞尚有大名艦續來、載有日海軍省武官四員、將常川駐廈、參贊軍事工作、同時駐廈門日領事館副領事以下、多改派海軍省人員充任、即此已可見日人企圖矣、</p>
<p>日人去歲在臺灣召集對岸會議後、獎勵臺人移華、故邇來臺人來廈日增、逐漸向內地推進、日人並獎勵臺人資本輸閩、大宗日貨、頃消閩省、經濟上之進展、極爲急速、一方極力拉攏各階級華人、並注意民軍、惟民軍雖不肖、尚鮮甘心賣國者、今大部已經省府中央編撫、日人此計、已失敗矣、</p>
<p>廈門地方情形特殊、日籍臺灣人極多、勢力極大、遍佈各憎階級、恃日人之勢、常在我國法治以外、任情橫行、所起之糾紛、報不絕書、復自成一組織、統以臺灣公會、治以日領事館、復有日警署、蓋日警署儼如公安局、臺灣公會則儼然臺民之廈門市議會也、臺人戶口、日人亦自行調查、遍布皆見臺灣公會編釘之戶口門牌、街巷分區、均高懸其區保委員會招牌、又日籍臺灣人、仗勢遇事優越、稅可不納、捐可不上、煙賭專利、各層階級、靡不顯其驕矜、以是少數不肖無知華人、歆羨之餘、乃亦希入日藉、日人亦藉此人籠絡各界人士、惟有識優秀之民衆、則鮮入其殻中、又日人在廈、表面不趨積極、故年來常遇臺人糾紛案、日領均未爲凌厲之態、惟謀和平解決之、此則以其尚不欲開罪英國、故勉作鎮靜耳、（二月十六日）</p>
<h3>朱家驊演講交通事業</h3>
<p>（丙）航政</p>
<p>交部行政中辦理最感困難的、莫如航政、因爲航權受條約束縛、動遇阻力、即如限制外籍引水、又以種種裑雜情形、迄未解決、且經費缺乏、各項收入維持各航政局日常經費、尚虞不足、更談不到興辦事業、最近將來、只有將沿海與內河方面樹立良好之基礎、再圖遠洋之發展、去年五月間舉行之全國航政會議、與促進討論會決議各案、均已逐漸分別緩急、予以施行、所有二十三年所進行的、此較重要事項、（一）一般航政之刷新、自前年改革航政附屬機關以來、各地船舶登記所盡行裁撤、從滬漢津三航政局下重要港埠設立辦事處、又以廣州航政局尚未成立、特設直轄廈門福州兩航政辦事處、並明定通海河流界限、俾與地方政府管理權限、不生衝突、進行甚爲順利、又以我國航海人才缺乏、吳淞商船專科學校、自十八年經本部設法恢復後、畢業人數尚少、上學期起、學生人數始增至三百餘名、下半年再當力爲擴充、增加設備、至於現在服務船員、自二十二年六月起、前後舉行定期考騐四次、綜計定期與臨時檢定合格者一千一百餘人、他如設法檢丈外輪、取締機器劃船、改善船舶管理、以及公佈保障旅客安全辦法、籌設海事公斷機關等等、皆去年悉力以赴之工作、亦當於今年完成之、（二）民營航業之監督與促進、本部爲減除航商過渡之競爭、使一致團結、增進經濟效能計、於去年組織航業合作設計委員會、詳密調查統計、妥爲設計、復令各航政局在航業合作計劃未公布以前、不論何種航綫、非有特別情形、均是維現狀、不準添輪、現在中國航業合作社籌備處、業經成立、合作方案之竤施、已開始進行、今年當促其完成、（三）國營招商局之籌盡整理、招商局自收歸國營以來、極力整頓、復添購海輪、招徠客貨頗多、四瓣輪除去一切開支與保險折舊以及分期還本付息外、平均每月凈餘約三萬元之譜、同時辦水陸聯運、自此該局南北洋綫及長江綫、均可與各鐵路啣接、以隴海綫重要、去年擴充海州分局、專辦聯運事宜、該局營業收入、因之頗有增加、又該局碼頭地位、本極優良、械房容積亦多、近年添建廣州械房、修建漢口南京鎮江天津等局所房屋、修理南械揚子等械、汕頭鎮江溫州長沙等處碼頭、因之客貨漸多、關於金利源楊家渡中械北華械、亦擬從新建築、俟籌有的欵、即可進行、又金利源等械、沿浦灘地、歷年均擬升科請領、未能解決、去秋方得辦妥、因此該局增加財產七百五十餘萬元、又各分局改行實報實銷制度、以資嚴密管理、自此收入較裕、又改革各輪買辦制度、採用事務長制、直接由局管理、先行試辦、現已逐漸推行於各輪、該局向有九五局傭以爲獎勵招徠之法、本年業已革除、以塞漏巵、此外如禁止俏包、注意各輪清潔衛生等、均在隨時整理、便利行客、故二十二年之營業、較十八年至二十一年四年、平均數增加百分之二十五、二十三年下半年統計未齊、而上半年營業比十八年至二十一年同期間平均數增加百分之三十一、惟歷年虧欠過鉅、年息須二百數十萬元、上年營業雖盈餘四五十萬元、何足相抵、故整理債務、實爲目前急務、現在本部電政債務、業經全部解決、對於該局債務之整理、亦在籌劃從速進行中、已令飭該局通知債權人商洽辦理、在本年內務期結束、又近來各方面均有開闢遠洋航綫的要求、招商局既爲國營事業、責無旁貸、惟沿海與沿江尚力有不及、暫時只好從緩、今年本部復擬添造江輪及海輪七萬噸、分二十四艘行駛沿海與長江、去年秋已開始分別接洽、一切頗爲接近、倘再進行順利、年內當有大部份加入各綫航行、</p>
<p>（丁）民用航空</p>
<p>民用航空、在交通不便的我國、尤爲重要、惟專靠郵政撥費、而無其他的欵補助、要求發展、實不可能、中國歐亞兩航空公司內部組織、現已健全、惟駕駛員非有一千點鐘以上飛行紀錄者、不能合格、故人才甚感缺乏、現在特別加以訓練、今年當可有一批良好的本國駕駛員之增加、（一）中國航空公司現有航綫爲滬蜀滬平滬粵、其中以滬屬營業爲最發達、已達成都、現正籌備成都至巴塘之航綫、再推進至拉薩、以期完成康藏的交通、滬平綫夏間可換新機、加開班次、改爲每天飛行、青威綫（青島經煙臺至威海衛）亦將開辦、滬粵綫內沿海氣候關係、去年開辦這初、很不順利、現已設法改善、正式復航、下半年亦將增加班次飛行、（上海漢口將開每日直達快班、沿途各站另開專班、滬平滬粵兩綫下半年亦或照此辦理）、廣州至河內一綫、亦正在審核中、渝昆綫業已試航成功、該公司去年度除去折舊尚能收支適合、今年更有盈餘、並不須補助、似爲各國航空公司所僅見、旅客票價去年已減去百分之二十、下午度起更擬減百分之二十、各綫均訂購新棧、五月問定可改換、（二）歐亞航空公司過去很多困難、原來直達柏林之計畫、迄今未能做到、前年開辦滬新綫、曾通迪化並達塔城、不久又因新省內部關係、飛機祇能到蘭州爲止、今年四月問、當可先行恢復至哈密、去年開辦之平粵綫、（北平至廣州）蘭寗綫、（蘭州至寗夏）寗包綫、寗夏至包頭下半年即可增加班次、現在更計畫西安至成都、廣州至昆明二綫、以發展西北及西南各地交通、昆明直飛仰光之綫、亦正在審核中、惟航空客票與貨價、均尚昻貴、與我國經濟狀況相去過遠、故該公司上月起、已將客貨價目減低四分之一、</p>
<p>（戊）會計制度</p>
<p>交通部掌理郵電航與民用航空等國營事業、會計自然占重要的地位、鄙人就任之初、特別注意及此、於各重要附屬機關、延聘中外會計師、定期審查、與常川分駐稽核、並設置查賬員、隨時分往查核與恊助、當時恰好有成立會計長辦公處之議、所以竭力促其實現、年來受主計處的指導、會計已具有獨立的精神、（一）普通公務會計、本部會計上所用賬冊表單、悉照國府頒佈、統一官廳會計制度規定辦法辦理、一切收支欵項、皆依統一圖庫收支辦法、由國庫轉賬、施以來、賬目隨時登記、報表按期編送、一切收支程度、可稱已上軌道、報表如非按期造送、隨即停發經費、䋉已收會計統制之效、（二）營業會計、郵政會計尚能依照營業會計原則辦理、電政會計向來是用一種官廳的方式、只要報而能銷、責任就算完了、無所謂營業會計、航政會計、招商局雖辦理數十年、會計制度向欠完密、年來之整理、對於會計方面甚爲注意、業已得有進步、至中國歐亞兩航空公司、會計上之情形、進步頗多、就以上情形論、電政航政會計之改革、較郵政尤爲急迫、而電政範圍廣大、尤爲繁重、故先行整理、歷任當局、本已注意及此、民國十九年間、曾頒定電政會計則例、不過多未實行、因此前年特組織電政會計修訂委員會、訂定各種章則、編訂各種實例、及推行須知、頒發各機關遵照、此項制度經主計處核定、已於去年下半年先行試辦、並經本部派員分赴各地切實指導、現在電政各機關、均已遵照新制辦理、預計全國電政總瘓產負債表不久當可編成、現又組織電政會計研究委員會、同時爲發揮會計獨立精神起見、以爲辦理會計人員、不應隨主管長官進退、去年上半年舉行會計人員考試、分發各附屬機關辦事、總之本部及所屬公務機關與電政會計、依照主計法令辦理以來、時間雖短、確已有相當的成績、本年內擬再在航政郵政方面確主計制度、確定其會計系統、使其完全獨立、並由本部直接指揮、更擬編訂交通會計書籍、以供參考、其他如會計人員之訓練、會計人員考試、均與推行制度有莫大之關係、亦擬視事實上之需要、次第計劃進行、</p>
<p>鄙人稟承中央的旨意、得部內外全體同事們的幫忙、所舉辦的事項、雖然所得到的結果、仍去理想很遠、交通事業久已千瘡百孔、但在我國現在經濟狀況之下、除專靠事業本身的收入來圖改進和發展外、別無他法、故凡百事業、要想在短時期內完成大規模的計畫、是很不容易的、但是爲交通事業的重要、與我國交通事業的幼稚、更應該有急起直追以謀發展的必要、只好在無辦法中想法、一步一步切實的做去、以上說的、是本年內進行中最低限度、均可一一完成、倘使進行順利、當可增加進展的和度、現在各項事業已有轉機、以後的希望、是很好的、至對於交通不便的地方、特別加以注意一層、仍當本年來的素志、一貫做去、不過交通事業範圍的廣大、現在希望固多、鄙人才力薄弱、所得到的效果、深恐很有限的、這是很慚愧的、（中央社）</p>

<h3>勞働託兒所變通收容兒童</h3>
<p>內部設備均已完功</p>
<p>本埠南市蓬萊路近泮坊勞働託兒所、自成立以來、對於內部設備、漸致完善、惟收容兒童、因一般勞苦階級、對該所服務職責、尚多隔膜、故將兒童送往寄託者、爲數甚少、新瓣社記者昨晨特往該所探詢、據該所主任朱寄滄女士、告以最近進行情形頗詳、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>創辦宗旨</p>
<p>朱女士首稱本所開辦之目的、原爲社會一般勞苦階級之子女著想、專以收容寄託兒童、對扶養各項、均依據勞工家庭生活程度之待遇、至設備芳面、則力求衛生、並引起兒童對生活方面之興趣、如浴室·寢室·診療室·游戲室、皆適合一般嬰孩所需要、故設備業已完全竣工、</p>
<p>變通收容</p>
<p>至於收容兒童之數量、起初限於經費、故祇定收容三十名、詎於開始以來、事誠有出於意料之外者、蓋至今祇有十餘人而已、嗣經調查後、乃知一般勞苦工人、不明真相、未敢將其子女送來寄託、今本所擬增加保養兒童數額計、除收容警士及低級公務人員之子女外、關於敎員、每月薪金不滿五十元之子女、亦予變通收容、惟額數仍定三十名云、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>玄談</h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>記得從前讀過的託名東方朔著的神異經中講起過世間有這樣一個奇怪的生物，呌做「論獸」，它的肉是很美的，不過人吃了它要有說話不真的危除。世間究否有這樣一種生物，我並無興趣去研究；世人的說話不真，究否由於吃了這種物生物，我也無從知道。但世人的說話不真，卻是一個周知的事實。我得聲明我是人羣的一員，人們既說話不真，我也自不能例外。我雖沒有吃過訛獸，然而我的說話，我自已知道，大都是不真的。那些「峨冠博帶」自以爲說真話的「君子」，應該不屑敎訓而去。我再得聲明，我認爲好意的祝福，也許並不是好意，瘋狂的責罵，也許並不是惡意。和尚沿路跪拜，徒表現虛僞，令人憎恨而已，他方面，潑婦罵街，自有熱忱，也並不可深非的。所以我與其虛僞地替人家祝福，還不如熱烈地斥罵人家，因爲好意的祝福，是宗敎家分內的事，而不是我的事。那些希望好意祝福的人，應該怫然而去。我再得聲明，我也既是呼吸在人羣的一個，我並沒有與其他的人有什麼兩樣，所有些特別的是；人羣中的認爲是優點的，我卻沒有，而人羣中所認爲缺點的，我都俱全。由某種觀點看來，應該受人斥罵的應該是我而不是別人。然而在我一方面，我卻只是見到別人的錯處而不見到我自已的錯處，這我又得講，是人類共同的缺點，我可以原諒我自已的，別人的是否原諒我，那我就管不了許多。一個人忠於別人還不如忠於自已，對自已忠不了，那末不得已而忠於別人，其事則可憫，則心則可原。</p>
<p>不過世人世外表方面都在勸人不要忠於自已，而忠於別人；在內心方面，卻都是過分的忠於自已，而絕對的不忠於別人，這原因都是吃了訛獸之後，講話不真的程度到於「爐火純青」的地步。然而在我看來，這樣內心上的絕對忠於自已，而外表上的「口是口非」地勸人忠於別人，頗有些不大痛快，還不如老實地外表上也是忠於自已，內心也是忠於自已。這種揭開事實的講話，也許講話不真的程度，沒有那些外表與內心是不一致的人那麼純粹。這或者是「智者千慮，必有一失」之故。古人早已前我言之。我是否智者，這又得讓人去評論，評論的好和壞，我將置之不聞不問，因爲別人的講話的不真，我早已知道。我的所謂智，正是你的所謂不智，你的所謂不智，也許正是我的所謂智。你自然會拿出標準給我看，你自然會拿出經典給我看，你自然也會拿出戒尺給我看，最後你還會拿出木乃伊給我看。可是這是沒有用的。我也會拿禁準給你看，會拿經典給你看，拿戒尺給你看，最後我還會拿木乃伊給你看。所以你的法寶，你的野人頭，你的假面具，你的隱身符，只能在那些不會用法寶，不會賣野人頭，不會罩假面具，不會披隱身符的人的面前去玩，而不能在會用法寶，會賣野人頭，會罩假面具，會披隱身符的人面前去玩。你如果拿出你的法寶來，我們就得門一下法。門法的結果，你現出了狐貍尾巴，你就不配來大搖大擺地講不真的話，我現出了狐貍尾巴，我就不配大搖大擺地來講不真的話。如果大家半斤八兩，大家相揖而退，各退其所。這自然是最妥的辦法，因爲大家都能藏了尾巴，而不致狼狽。如果兩敗俱傷，大家就無味了。但人之性都喜歡藏了自已的尾巴，而願意看人家的尾巴，這就不免王道士捉妖，捉不住妖，要被妖拋得滿頭大糞了。</p>
<p>這是呌做「自作薛不可活！」人類的本性如此，奈何？</p>
<h3>春之前望</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>春天似乎是已經來了，二月初的一次很大的春潮，帶來春的消息。春潮這一詞在我們心上很富於象徵意味，雖然從西洋文學傳來的春潮，那潮并不是海潮，而是指融後的春汎，但我們這些大洋西岸上的居民，海潮也一樣帶給我們以春信，我們就把他混通也可以。</p>
<p>在兼用回歸年標準的建寅歷上，春確是起於二月初的，（即以立春爲的起點，）但現行的格暦，春的起點卻在春分，我們現在離著春就還有兩節路。但我們不必依格曆而埋怨潮信的無信，牠到底告訴我們預備等著春的來到。我們能預感一個好時代的會來，比只覺著牠的涉茫，要安慰得多的。</p>
<p>比一切其他的春的跡象更早出現，更見顯著的，還是這春潮。島沒有鳴，花沒有開，連樹葉也沒有黃緣，而我們從前就會相信是是春的緣故，許是爲了潮吧。潮與月有自然的關係，我們從前習慣上的春，不嚴密地說牠起於立春，而普遍地作爲起於舊歷正月，若就月與潮的關係想是可說爲了有一顯著的跡象的。元旦及其後幾日的朝與月，我們不能并見，也許還不能直接感覺。而元宵時則兩者，一同給我們以信息，就深足引起我們的鼓舞了。月是每年要圓十幾次的，而惟獨中秋與元宵的月圓，被我們視爲佳節，中秋月的何以被注意，是大家所熟悉的，元夜月呢，則爲牠傳來春的消息了。依舊日習慣，元宵這一日是正好稱作「春之望」的。</p>
<p>「春之望」，不單我們久慣於用陰曆的人注意，用陽歷已久的西洋人，迄今還每年注意適「春之望」。被是以「春之望」作標準的。實在我們與其稱之作外國清明，不如稱之爲外國上已（舊歷三月三，）因爲清明這節氣是以回歸年的標準定的，固定在陽歷上，和復活命的差移很大，而復活節與陰歷比較，則一定是三月三日前後的望日後的星期日，就不會差到一星期以上了。</p>
<p>復活節的被注意，似乎是由於宗敎儀式，但也正如中國人清明的以掃墓爲名，事實上是鼓勵游春的，就一般人對於復活的過法看，也可見這真義的爲大家所默契。</p>
<p>外國的月亮，在一般人—即除航海家，天文家—是完全忽視了，因之算復活節先定春分後的望日。在我們陰歷已廢的今日，及將來，要知道元宵，大概也要從復活望去求。那很簡單。略改變西洋以春以後的望日爲「春之望」的習慣，我們以春分前後的十五日內（三月六日到四月四日）的月圓爲，「春之望」，這望前一月的月圓，就是元宵，要表明其現用的意味，也可稱作「春之前望」。</p>
<p>就游覽上的實得愉快說，在「春之望」時，確可以獲得更多些。西洋人一定要把這望放在春分以後，也正因此。但爲抒發感到春來的愉快，則在「春之前望」更合適，所以我們以前注意元宵，也是有理由的。我們無須由春而想到月，我們由月就探求春的前途。向來人是把月看作引起人的感傷，懷舊的情緒的，但至少元宵之月，很少具有這種意味，她正如她所帶來的春潮，推展著無窮的希望。</p>
<p>因然，像朱淑真（？）詞中所表現的，因看元宵的月，而想到，「不見去年人」因而「涙混羅衫袖」完全也是感傷，懷舊的，但我們不能僅看這半首，試再想她「去年元夜時」那時，「月上柳梢頭，人約黃昏後」那種有情趣的境界，也正是由春之明月激發而來，假使其要是花好月圓，則元宵之月所留下的，自然是完全的歡意。且就後半首的感傷，也是臨歡塲而隕涕，而不是䚪凄景而增悲，元宵的月還到底是興奮的。</p>
<p>能在寒風凜烈的侵遍中而仍帶著歉意看月，這也是人類偉大精神的一面。春潮的確是有信的，春天準定是要來到的，這信仰既不會改變，當然會感到愉快了。讓我們在這春之「前望」來把酒問青天吧。</p>
<h3>北平的風趣</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>昨天夜睡，不覺不知爲什麼卻想起許多北平的舊事來。</p>
<p>我離開北平已竟有六七年了，從來沒有想過牠，當時我住在北平的時候，並不如何感到興趣，不曉得爲什麼昨夜在牀上睡不著，卻想起牠許多的好處來，大概這事也同戀愛一樣，兩人天天見面，握著手談天，當時並不覺得如何，到了兩人一分離，十年八年不見，忽然有一天想起當年兩人曾握手談天，便曉得那時的握手真是難得，真是富有神秘性，於是一種似悵惘而非悵惘的情緒，在心裹直打滾。我對於北平大概也有這樣。</p>
<p>前天一個朋友來談，一直談到深夜，送他出大門的時候，已是星斗滿天了，天河很低的，天上的繁星，彷彿一抬手就可以摘下來，四外非常的清靜，一開門，鄰人的狗叫了幾聲，正趕上胡同內的燈也熄了，只可以望見馬路外邊的一盞昏黃的燈，而胡同內卻是異常的黑暗。這時我忽然想到北平的胡同，假使這地方再能聽得見一聲梆子蠁，我就會忘記我是在天津的。</p>
<p>在天津很難使人注意節季的變遷，頂多不過棉衣易夾衣，夾衣又易單衫而已；而在北平卻不然，北平的胡同是十足的表現著春夏秋冬的不同，一到春天，胡同裹最易起小旋風，薄薄的一片土捲著柳絮，非潰的富有詩意。下起小雨來，胡同內就不易走人同，沒有事最好不出門，打幾個子兒的燒酒，買一包落花生一吃，坐在家裹聽門口賣青菜縵葡的吆喝，是另有一種風趣的。到了春宋夏初的時候，就有賣青杏的，賣櫻桃桑葚的，還有賣各種花的，尤其是落過雨之後，花兒更顯著鮮艷，再加上賣花的富有藝術味的嗓子，顫顫的一聲；「買架竹桃來，石榴花來！」真令人想起放翁的名句：「小樓昨夜聽春雨，深巷明朝賣杏花。」一到夏天，人們熱得四體流汗的時候，正午卻有小孩子賣冰核（音胡）的，挑著兩塊冰，一邊喊：「冰核來，冰核來！」一邊卻飛也似的跑出胡同那頭去了，因爲賣冰非跑不可，如果像賣花的那樣文謅謅的，賣　不了幾個主顧，冰也就融化完了。這也是一種趣味化的買賣，因爲賣冰既賺不了多少錢，而在夏天正午的時候，還要擔著冰快跑，在我們看來當然是很受罪的，然而小孩子們卻以爲跑跑玩玩是夠趣味的。</p>
<p>秋天一來，更易落雨，落過幾塲雨之後，樹上的葉子幾乎就像隨著雨也落完了，惟悴的黃葉零亂的在胡同內滾來滾去，假若有詩人要想「獨尋黃葉路」的話，不必到什麼郊野的地方去，在北平的胡同內就可以有這種風趣了。黃葉颯颯的一響，跟著賣玉米花，涼炒豆的就來了，還有賣新落花生的，這幾種賣東西的聲音，無異就是告訴人「預備棉袍子吧。」果然秋天沒有鑫少時候就過去了。我記得彷彿是魯訊先生說過，北平沒有春秋，頗有點道理，假若冬天一延長，夏天一提早，把這春天卻無形之中越過去了；冬天提早，夏天延長，秋天也就很短了。雖然是這樣，然而北平的賣東西的，對於季候，是一點也錯不了的。</p>
<p>北平的冬天更能令人領略出一種特殊的況味。現在差不多的人家大概都裝上洋爐子了，在從前卻沒有，都是小白爐子，如果在彤雲欲雪的黃昏，屋中不必點燈，小白爐子內的煤球紅紅的，可以照見人的鬚眉，屋內充滿了淡紅色的光，薄薄的窗紙「席席颯颯」的一響，跟著就是風門子被風吹開，「邦」的一聲，又關上了。這種特殊的風趣在當時多不注意，而我們幾個朋友卻正在圍著爐子烤手，有的手裹抱著壸；作詩，大概誰也沒有那種閒散的心情，下一盤圍棋，倒可以使人忘了冷，再不然早早的鑽進大棉被裹去，躺著看書，躺著吸紙煙，這時不曉得外面是否落了雪，也更不注意外面的風，然而在很遠很遠的地方，卻被風吹來一聲「讓！蔔來—賽梨」的尖勵的調兒，有時還會同火車的哨子成一個合奏調，這時我們躺在被窩裹的心情，真不知是麼滋味，悵惘吧，談不到；悲哀吧，更不是，喜悅吧，絕沒有一點，只是心裹空空的，覺得有點迷惘愛惡欲的七情之外的，所以沒有法子可以形容當時的裹是一種什麼滋味。</p>
<p>再其次的就是我領略出北平胡同的不規則的美，此如一個大紅門樓旁邊，就許有一個小黑門，小黑門裹就許有兩查大棗樹，而胡同又都是彎彎曲曲的，比如說狗尾巴胡同，真的彎的像一條狗尾巴，鐵師子胡同，雖然沒有鐵獅子，然而卻有一對石獅子。北平胡同的名字，大概都是名符其實的，而天津卻不然，無論大小的里，不以德名，就以義名，比如說崇德里，而這里裹的人，未必就真崇德。房子都是一樣的形式，排得密密的像鴿子籠，令人見了，便有一種不快之感。</p>
<p>還有令我感到興趣的，就是北平胡同內的打燈謎的，和說書的。每到夜間，許多斗方名士，無聊的文人都聚在墻根下，兩眼死釘著燈籠上的白紙條子，猜中的還可以有兩小包茶葉的希望，然而誰都不希望這一點微物，最主要的還是興趣問題。有三次猜不中，就嘴巴子撅起來，微微的感覺著有點失望了。說書的塲，我也有十幾年沒去了，在桃花扇上看到柳敬亭的說書，總是令我想起那個說書的拍醒木的神情。這種大衆的如樂塲所，假若我現在再去，一定可以令我想到許多的社會問題。然而，這些都跟我遠遠的離去了！</p>
<h3>再渡班哖河</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>從大崅回來的第二天下午，我便再渡班哖河。</p>
<p>趁著××公司的小汽輪，便不用受著潮水的支配，把船著直向對岸駛去。急潮受著機器力的衝擊，時時噴起了頗爲不小的浪花。一些細小的馬來舟子，經不起急潮的衝激，不住地把一葉舟子在波頭上搖擺起來。馬來人用著有力的腕臂，和熟練的駕舟術，時時順著波濤的起伏，把舟子從小汽輪的橫截面慢慢地漂起來。</p>
<p>太陽從班哖埠的後面照出來，在混濁的河水上閃起了金色。返觀過去，班哖埠便在綠叢間慢慢縮小起來，像電影景色的淡入般地。</p>
<p>舟停在班哖對岸的碼頭，一羣馬來人便蜂湧般地進來奪搶客人的行李。沈君的兒子嚇得把手提的小皮箱緊緊地抓住，并且怒喊起來。等覺察到這只是一班遊手好閒的馬來青年的玩戲，才把小口嘻嘻地笑出來。</p>
<p>在岸上的一間白鐵屋頂的小屋子前面，一輛汽車孤另另地擺立著。四面寂無人家，赤熱的太陽光在面前躺著一道大馬路上蒸起了濃厚的塵煙。</p>
<p>汽車開動起來，我們便衝進班哖屬的小地方去了</p>
<h3>金久爸（續完）</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>一個早上當金久爸出去了時她在坑沿前地上發現一攤鮮紅的血，稠得像有血塊。她用紙蓋上，耐著心跳。</p>
<p>金久爸的嗆咳慢慢密了，兩眼灰白得像是嚇嚇去了靈魂，眼睛和兩頰的肉金陷了下去。孩子抓著爸爸的手腕，天真地比著：</p>
<p>「爸爸的胳臂和久一樣粗！」</p>
<p>另一個只是澀著嗓子笑著。</p>
<p>女人當丁僅有的一副銀鐲給男的醫了一次病。</p>
<p>「得休息哩，」大夫從銀絲眼鏡背後惟著這一對夫婦的臉，連病人的泛白的皮膚這時都現了現紅，像是驚罵著這個治法，丈夫便轉了口：</p>
<p>「再不然，銜吃幾隻鷄也好，白燉，凈喝湯。」</p>
<p>把病人扶回了家，兩個人全楞了。</p>
<p>「休息，說得容易，大夥埃餓？支撐一天算一天！」男的咬牙說了，第二天便又顯顯讀讀地出去了，一副擔擔子晃來見去的。金久爸依然沙啞著嗓子在藍布圈底下唱著，這其間他還吐了幾口血，便用腳站點兒土庶上了。</p>
<p>女人那裹卻忙著等待買出裔小鷄。</p>
<p>癟了兩天肚子算成了一對。黃蔥蔥的毛掩在背脊上，女人當心牠們像當心久兒一樣，怕街坊的孩子們踏或野貓銜了去，把牠們扣在一個竹編罩子底下。</p>
<p>每天，女人用黏紙燈盒的幾個大子兒換來點高梁喂著小鷄，看見牠們漸漸有了大鷄模樣便高興起來，但看見男的病狀更壞下去時，便又嫌小鷄長得太慢了。</p>
<p>小鷄兒竟是在長著的，食量增大了，每天放下去的幾把高梁一啄便沒了。女人卻找不到更多的錢來買高梁了。</p>
<p>直到金久爸支撐不起來的那天——凈臍下幾口氣的那天，兩隻小鷄卻餓得快停止呼吸了。</p>
<p>人和鷄各在掙扎著自已已經有限的生命。</p>

<h3>史高塔杯複賽酣戰二小時精疲力竭東華臘克斯成和局</h3>
<p>結果二比二未分勝負</p>
<p>延長時間仍舊成平手</p>
<p>東華臘克斯昨日在申圍之史高塔杯複賽、竟陷於空前未有之酣戰、苦門兩小時、卒未分勝負、以二比二和局、上半時東華連中二球、臘克斯亦中一球、東華以二比一佔先、下半時臘克斯罰中十二碼球、東華則一無所獲、及至終局、二比二和局、裁判員李諾斯依據盃賽複賽、和局必須延時間之規定、延長三十分鐘、仍爲二與二之比、乃宣告停賽、大約下星期六再行重賽、東華本季中除敗於北寗外、此戰尚爲第一次之苦門、致令八千球迷、如醉如癡、陷入坐立不安之境、出塲陣綫如下、</p>
<p>勢均力敵旗鼓相當</p>
<p>東華因陳洪光之留港、中衛綫不無影響、丁兆成已盡其力、經騐似嫌不足、小戴久疏戰塲、昔日之鋒鋩、昨日尚未恢復、碌碌無所見、萬象華之黃金時代已過、反顧麗克斯、皆青年之士、能奔能跑、洛根格列夫較弱外、柯克倫救險不少、前鋒之中、首推鮑塞利、顧前顧後、勞苦功高、阿提格（前作亞爾傑）妙球頻頻、令人叫好、五鋒惜乎聯絡較差、否同東華更將受累、故昨日一戰、勢均力敵、空氣之緊張、不能令觀者安然坐定也、</p>
<p>此去彼來各呈驚險</p>
<p>腦克斯首先開球、東華截球回攻、馮運佑傳李義臣、李對門開砲、不料一飛沖天、臘克斯亦來、雪蒙斯傳日麥達、已抵門前、幸李寗一衝而退、球自賈幼良傳中洛根趕救、李義臣雖猛射而進、以李非法撞人不計、阿提格對門遠射、陸鍾恩老拳一揮、悅回半塲、賈幼良穿過洛根、傳送中央、戴麟經趕上一頂、以爲必中無疑、不料從橫木上一彈而下、李義臣失足未中、萬分可惜</p>
<p>不中則已中則兩隻</p>
<p>兩方相持不下、來往頻頻、十五分鐘際、此緊張之局面、經李義臣之一腳、遂起變化、臘克斯左防空空、賈幼良如入無仍之境、陳家球帶上傳賈、賈一竄深入、再傳家球、洛根欲救仍失足、李義臣漁翁得利、一蹴而中、歡聲起於四野、一波方平一波又起、二分鐘之內、東華依樣葫盧、再來隻、賈幼良乘虛從右搗入、賈再送中、李義臣砰然送人、臘克斯膛目不知所措、亦出人意料之事、</p>
<p>麥達報復收回一球</p>
<p>緊張之局面、從此由鬆而弛、臘克斯屢次反攻、功虧一簽、曰柯克倫猛射一球、恰落陸鍾恩之手、麥達兄弟、妙球頻送、無人接應可惜、鮑賽利進逼、阿關挑成角球、阿提格開來真妙、奈何李達高球飛天、上半時之最後十分鐘時、格利夫截得丁兆成之球、送阿提格、阿提格腳起如飛、送入中間、曰麥達低球一腳、陸鍾恩身長難屈、已入綱底矣、臘克斯雖仍反攻不已、上平時以二比一、東華居先、</p>
<p>阿關失手罰十二碼</p>
<p>易換陣地、二次接觸、僅五分鐘、東華忽禍從天降、被判罰十二碼、Ｔ麥遠從右襲入、球傳至中、李寗方欲踢出、關洵安一不小心向對方球員背上一推、李諾斯冷眼已被瞥見、陸鍾恩雖向之責問、仍由臘克斯柯克倫主踢、球向左滾去、陸鍾恩橫地一撲、撲得復落脫、柯克倫趕上再加一腳、遂滾進綱、四座轟然、表示爲東華不服、然意氣之爭、二比二之結果成立、毫無疑問、腦克斯經此一球、氣燄大盛、左沖右突、東華竟處於捉襟見肘之境、險象百出、無不爲東華叫危、諸將奮勇掙扎、勉強維持終局、</p>
<p>延長時間依舊和局</p>
<p>杯賽複賽、和局必須延長、裁判員鳴笛再戰、東華諸人、已精疲力竭不願戰、復有若干人之從恿、然限於規則、仍列陣繼續、東華開球、顧尚勷先送高球出陣、萬象華又射而失的、馮運佑在後放重砲、又爲守門獲救、東華球運不際、亦沒可奈何、臘克斯亦有反攻、麥達低球、陸鍾恩得而又失、阿提格趕上稍遲、未曾得中、換地後、戴麟經在人叢之中、對準球門力射、其重無比、竟能落入柯克倫之手、亦臘克斯之幸運也、</p>

<p>東南對華東、爲本屆女籃球賽之揭幕、惟華東一部份球員因中途汽車拋錨、遲半點鐘始到、該隊枱柱施藉卿在第三節上塲、軍情大振、迭獲十分、無如當先損失奇重、難挽危局、被東南以三十二對十分告捷、</p>
<p>東南甲勝暨南（女甲）東南對暨南之甲組、繼後交綏、東南女將究是專家、打來有聲有色、對隊暨南陣上、聞係中學部人才、均極嬌小、一旦與茲大敵迎戰、有應付維艱之概、激戰之下、除陳秀梅葉順妹射中兩球外、僅憑罰球得四分耳、結果被東南以二八對八分獲勝、</p>
<p>真如擊敗鷹隊（甲甲）</p>
<p>兩隊於女子賽結束後開始接觸、初則相持不下、有難解難分之勢、在十分鐘後、真如健兒、愈打愈兇、此鷹隊呈不支、上半時完、二九對十二、真如佔得絕對優勢、結果爲五茉對廿一、鷹隊大敗、</p>

<h3>中國地質學會閉幕丁文江楊傑又各有新發現　中國全國鐵鑛產量有一千億噸之多日本每年需要我國鐵砂二百餘萬噸</h3>
<p>翁文灝在年會中重要之講演</p>
<p>（北平特訊）中國地質學會連日在平開會、北平學術界呈現充滿研究科學之空氣、該會昨今兩日（十五日十六日）下午均宣讀論文、昨日上午翁文灝博士假北京大學、講演「中國煤油鐵鋁鑛概況」、頗多有價值之統計材料、今日上午會員參觀北大地質系新建之敎室及地質調查所陳列館、各有所記載及討論、當晚全體會員在歐美同學會舉行聚餐會、贈送葛利普獎章、並宣告閉幕、茲分誌各方詳情如次、</p>
<p>翁文灝講</p>
<p>翁文灝十五日上午十時、在北京大學、講演「中國煤油鐵鋁鑛概況」、略調史弟今日講中國鑛產情形、前地質調查所曾出版「中國鐵鑛」書、爲丁格蘭成著、惟該書之成、非丁獨力、地質所諸位同人、均有供給、該書內載中國鐵鑛產量爲九五一百萬噸數目甚小、如美國每日大量開採、恐不二三年即可採完、此項鐵鑛、遼寗方面有四分之三、察哈爾遵化·宣化·龍關方面有四分之一、中央曾招商合辦龍巖公司開採、在西山建大鎔鐵爐、結果因股東鬧意見、未能出鐵、英國同時發現同樣鐵鑛、組他他鐵廠開採、每年出鐵一百二十萬噸、此外長江一帶、湖北·安徽·江蘇·各省均有鐵鑛、每年有二百萬噸鐵砂、運往日本、湖北漢口冶萍鐵鑛爲張之洞等所創辦、與日本訂定合同、每年供給鐵砂一百萬噸、現在該合同仍存在、安徽鐵鑛、產量亦甚豐、爲日本注意、亦訂定合同、每年供給鐵砂一百萬噸、此外日本並與馬來半島、鐵鑛訂立合同、每年供給五十萬噸、中國鐵鑛雖窮、但據新調查、發現以上數未列之省分尚多、（一）江西萍鄉縣境內鐵鑛可產二百萬噸、永新縣境內鐵鑛可產一百萬噸、（二）湖北宣都可產四百萬噸、（三）湖南寗鄉可產一百七十萬噸、茶陵安華·原陵·華地·亦均有鐵鑛、以上各省共二千五百萬噸、（四）熱河省灤平·隆化、等地可產一千五百萬噸、（五）綏遠省、白雲郭博可產一千萬噸、以上各省共產一千五百萬噸、全國總計可產一千億噸、再講鋁鑛、我國鋁製器具多係外貨、但我國鋁鑛亦有數處、物量亦不小、此項鋁可分二類、（一）鋁養石（Buxite）鑛、在山東溜川、博山一帶、經調查可產二千七百億噸、惟成數甚雜、Ｂouxite、僅有不足十分之一、（二）明隸在浙江平陽、現在調查可產二十萬噸、其成分僅百分之三十五爲純粹磬石、此外安徽滬江亦有一鑛、可產一百七十億噸云、</p>
<p>俄國盆地</p>
<p>丁文江宣訊論文「俄國多內茲盆地之地層、」大意如下、多內茲盆地、葛利普認之爲二疊紀、莫斯科系認爲中石炭紀、下部爲蘭加系、余在俄國採集孔錄化石、以便研究比較、孔蠱分層李四光研究、俄國學者認爲化石有一不「連續」、頗不盡然、故須將葛氏所分多內茲系分爲上下二半、</p>
<p>重要討論</p>
<p>丁文江宣訊論文畢、葛利普加以討論、謂此次中國地質學者在俄國採集材料回國、經中國古生物學者加以研究、獲得良好之成績、使我非常高興、本人以前所分、皆根據俄國地質學界之出版物、最近俄國地質學家李卡諾夫及福列得二博士在中國地質學會所發表之論文二篇、二人意見頗不一致、如有孔蟲爲可靠之分層化石、則本人甚同意丁文江博士之意見云、</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>世界有名之地質學家北平大學敎授葛利普博士</p>
<p>奇特化石</p>
<p>楊傑除於第一日開會時宣訊論文「北平西山羊房花崗週圍贊質作用」外、今日（十六日）又讀第二篇論文「山西五臺山南臺南部變質石灰巖內錐管狀化石」、其新發現之要點如下、中國前寒武記地層、現今分爲三大時期、泰山系、五臺系、與震旦系、泰山系、山片麻巖構成、五臺系由片成巖構成、大部由水成巖變來、震旦系多屬水成巖、在片麻巖內、當然不會有生物遺物、即在五臺系變成巖內、亦不當有化石、作者去歲曾在南臺南部週、龍底村附近變質石灰巖內、發見類似Collenia化石、但比此物瘦而長、故當杘Ｇymnosolen類、此類在加拿大·瑞典·極北之寒武記奧陶記諸地層內發現過、然而南臺南部、確爲五臺系、此系向未有生物遺物發現、所以此卻爲吾人最當注意之點、</p>
<p>贈送獎章</p>
<p>今晚九時、發表本年得葛氏獎章者爲丁文江德日進二人、由葛和普將金質獎章送予丁德二氏、該項獎章係一九二五年會長王龍佑所倡議、由中國地質學會發給金質獎章、並定名曰葛氏將章、以爲其師葛利普博士永久紀念、王君自捐六百元、除充作第一次獎章鑄費外、其餘即作爲此項獎章永久基金、第一次獎章即贈給葛利普博士、並訂守規則七條、十五年三月八日地質學會評議會開會、通過實行、獎章委員第二次委員照獎章規則第三條規定、應（照筆畫次序）丁文江·五寵佈·李四光·章鴻劉·翁文灝·葛利普·六君云、（瑾十六日）</p>

<h3>怎樣能使中國科學醫之普及（下）</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫講　江晦鳴記</p>
<p>我們看了上面所說的事實，我們很清楚的認識，沒有科學頭腦的人，他們一切理據都不講，他們祇知道能治好我們病，這個醫生就有真本領，實力量。大凡人類野蠻和文明的區別，就在於觀察事物能分析和不能分析；科學和非科學的區別就在於分析得精確和不精確。沒有科學頭腦的人和半開化的人們，是祇曉得物理學上的合力而不曉得其分力；祇認識化學上的合成物，而不曉得其成分。所以往往把複雜的現成當做簡單的原理。他們只看見國醫也有時候把病弄好，就說中國的醫學也有道理，更不追求病是怎樣好的？道是在那裹？理是在那裹？所以我們就是積極宣傳醫藥革命的言論，他們充耳不聞，不願意接受，絕對是沒有效果的。我剛纔聽見有一位演說，主張要使得科學醫普及，是要到民間去！這雖是普及科學醫學的基本問題；我以爲也應該到政府去！我說的到政會去，不是去做官，是我們應該拏出宋研尹文上說下敎的方法，要遊說到有政權的人，都來明了科學。假如執政的人個個能覺悟，能扶助中國的科學醫的事業，一方面所謂上行下效，一方面運用政治的力量來改造醫學，那普及中國的科學醫，是一蹴可待的，是輕而易舉的。我以爲普及中國的科學醫，非用政治的力量，不能解決。若是像我們做下層工作在民間宣傳，不知在一百年一千年以後，才有效果可以顯出來沒有！</p>
<p>剛纔有一位同學說；「舊醫在現在，不能不忍痛犧牲，將它廢除」！這句話，我很贊成，我認爲這是最合理的一件事。吳稚暈先生我記得我他說過；「國粹是臭東西！再過三四十年再講起來的尚未爲遲，現在要把它東置高閣」。吳先生這話，雖不是對醫的，我以爲對於國醫也正要這樣辦纔好。</p>
<p>有人說中國的藥材，是有靈騐的，是值得贊揚的。不錯，可是我們要認清，「學不是藥」，「藥不是學」。現代的學，逃不出科學的範圍。達爾文的哲學是以研究生物學的學問做根據的，所以講到「醫與藥」，也必須以科學做根據。換句話說：會用藥的人，不見得就是懂醫學，沒有知識的動物，也都會用的。我記得太平廣記卷一百二十醫類說道：「虎中藥箭，食清呢；野豬中藥箭，豗薺蒐而食；雉被麑傷以地黃葉帖之。又礬石可以害鼠，張驚曾試之，鼠中毒如醉，亦不識人，猶知取泥計飮之，須臾平復」云云。照這樣看起來，那鼠子等也會用藥，難道也算懂藥學嗎？再說「經騐」與「學問」，也是兩件事，「經騐」與「學問」，是沒有關係的。我再舉個例。譬如說：某一個人婦人，月經停止了兩三個月，常常的覺得有些倦怠，泛啞，嘔吐，腹部一天一天膨大起來，這樣情形，就是鄉下的老婆婆，她也會知道這是姙娠的象徵，如此看來，我們可以承認這考婆婆也懂醫學嗎？在中國的一班人，往往以「經騐」與「學問」，混爲一談；實際上講起來，經騐與學問是風馬牛不相及！</p>
<p>最後我有一段補充；剛纔有位同學，主張利用地方徵收一些賦稅，來辦理地方醫藥慈善事業，供一般貧窮的人，都可以得沾科學醫的恩惠。我認爲這件事，多少是有流弊的。現在的中國，苛捐雜稅的名目，尚未盡除，人民的擔負已經是加重許多了；假如我們也要實行這種辦法，等於多增加人民一重擔負，在事實上，恐怕不是十分妥當的辦法。現在文明各國，都有所謂醫藥保險費，每一個人薪水當中，抽出幾分之幾，儲作請醫服藥的準備，我們衛生行政上，也應該仿效起來，似乎比徵收賦稅徠得妥當些吧？今天我所貢獻的止此。（完）</p>
<h3>討厭之百日咳（上）</h3>
<p>— 鍾志和</p>
<p>可愛之春光轉瞬又屆。盛行之傳染癥接踵已至。小兒處此惡劣間攻擊之中。爲父母者倘無相當之醫學常識。焉得保兒童生命之安全。申報當局有鑒於此。爰於每週發行醫藥週刋。灌輸醫學知識。庶同胞對疾病知所預防。即傳染癥之受染。亦不致徬徨失措也。查近日傳染癥之流行者。除白喉，麻疹，流行性腦脊髓膜炎外。百日咳實爲重要之一種。惜同胞漢視此癥。不加注意。以致每一發生。流行猖獗。枉死於斯癥者。不知凡幾。茲特將百日咳詳述如次。俾同胞有所警惕。夫百日咳。又名天哮嗆。屬特種流行性之地方性傳染癥。因患每呈陣咳。而發特殊之啼聲。故俗稱鷺鷺咳。其勢輕者。經三四星期而愈。重者緾綿至三四月。遂有百日咳之命名也。該癥世界各國均有發生。其病勢每經流行。漸趨沉重。約隔三四年流行一次。據Ｔoplitz氏之調查。該癥之病率。Ｍorbidity在小兒一至五歲最高。平均計之如下。</p>
<p>（一）小兒生後一歲。佔百分之一三·八。</p>
<p>（二）小兒兩歲。佔百分之二零·七。</p>
<p>（三）小兒三四歲。約佔百分之十三。</p>
<p>（四）五歲以後漸次遞減。</p>
<p>但據最近醫家之調查。小兒患傳染癥之死亡玄最高者。當推百日咳。且該癥常爲他種疾患之前驅。其特別爲肺結核癥。準備寄居之塲所。又麻疹（瘄子）與軟骨癥患者之最不幸併發癥。常爲百日咳。其死亡率之比較。嬰兒患者死亡率佔百分之二十六。小兒自一歲至兩歲患者死亡率佔百分之十，小兒年漸長死亡率亦隨之漸減。</p>
<p>原因……（一）冬春之交。最多發生。往往流行一時。（二）接觸傳染。有時家庭中若有一小孩感羅此癥。則全家小孩無能倖免。凡幼稚圓小學校育嬰所托兒所孤兒院等處。小兒麕集尤易傳染。此蓋因病孩咳嗽時。將癢液或唾沫細點噴出。傳染他孩。（三）由菌郵間接傳染。（四）一至五歲小兒。最易受染。（五）係因波根氏桿菌Ｂorder.geugon's　bacillns所致。（六）一次受染有免疫性。</p>
<p>症狀……潛伏期自七至十日不等。癥狀可分三期如後。——</p>
<p>（一）卡他期。發作之始。現欠爽傷風之狀。眼紅噴嚏。鼻流泗涕。枝氣管呈乾咳受惹不安之狀。每發微熱。自39.　。—40.　。此時現連續不止之咳嗽乃係一要狀。待七至十日後。則咳嗽增重。而呈　　矣。</p>
<h3>中國醫業之病態（下）</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>（丙）中國醫事未獨立</p>
<p>不論在行政上，敎育上，我國醫事之建設均未獨立，這是我們的最大污點，若彼先進各國醫業得以獨立，進懚之速，大有一日千里之勢。蓋其醫業得以獨立，不受外力的侵略與干涉，就有行政力量，敎育策略，力謀醫業發展可期。否則，終是徒然的。</p>
<p>茲略述其例端如下：</p>
<p>（一）醫校制不一致</p>
<p>醫校原是醫才的發源地，可是帝國主義者因含有政治背景。實行其野心政策。在我國設立醫校，促其畸形發展，以增他們的勢力。而各帝國各有他們的勢力圈。其校製當互異，所產生之醫才當亦良莠不一，均爲帝國主義者所利用。畢業後乘機遠上了政途，把中國的醫政倒行逆施起來，以帝國主義者易侵略的機會，致把中國的醫事混亂得一團糟，顯而易見。這是因醫車未獨立，無力整飭其校製統一使然。</p>
<p>（二）醫界無法律之保障</p>
<p>醫業原爲自由職業，與社會尤有密切關係，社會是複雜的，當然良莠不一。如其醫者遇著不良分子之控告於法庭，法官因見醫業未獨立，就可任其好惡而定罪，這樣難免不有冤枉發生，而真正的庸醫或許徼幸無罪。這樣醫者就人人自危，不能安心樂業，爲真正的社會服務。</p>
<p>（三）派雖紛爭</p>
<p>這也是因醫業不獨立，不能把英美德日法以及玄醫等惡才淘汰之，而統一爲真正的中國代表醫，故這些惡勢力仍存在於社會，樹起他們所宗之派別，猛力向各方侵攻。因他們立塲不同，當然排料異已，互相傾軋，爲地位爲飯盌而實行他們自私自利主義。如其醫業能早日獨立，就可以行政力量淘汰之。</p>
<p>（四）無創造精神</p>
<p>學術上的研討，是發明之源泉。因多數日人只知做日和尚撞日鐘，抱著得過且過的主義，無人無畏精神去創造。只知食懶去抄人家的後路。以爲便足可應用了。說得過火一點，就是竟連先進國最新學說也不及趕上，遑論其他。探源究根，這也是因政府無獎勵辦法獎勵務明者，而學者們因反正無獎勵金，誰肯去下若功夫？如其醫事能早日獨立，也能現先進國般頌發獎勵辦法後，至少可使每一學者有一點貢獻，發揮他們的創造精神。</p>
<p>（五）一部分醫者太商業化</p>
<p>醫業原屬慈善性質，如其爲營業性質者，已失了醫了爲仁術之本旨。這些醫者我們可名他們爲江湖化，因其缺乏道德修養，毫無道德。如其醫事能早日獨立，這些怪現象亦可絕跡。</p>
<p>（六）中國缺乏相當代表醫</p>
<p>若醫事已獨立，則可以行政力量，不論其爲科學醫。玄醫均加以訓練，度設進修班，予他們有進修之機會，期滿加以嚴格之考試，以定去取。如能合於下例條件者。便可爲我國真正的模範代表醫：</p>
<p>頭腦須科學化手足須平民化，能參透中西一切學說，能體察民情，不洋化，不貴族化，具有高尚的人格，能遵守醫德。</p>
<p>（七）理想的醫團未能實現</p>
<p>這個醫團，原是爲統一醫界團結，促進醫業發展，惜醫事未獨立，無辦促其實現。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>（丁）科學化的藥業的薄弱</p>
<p>藥與醫具有密切關係，未有聞天之下有不藉藥力而爲醫者。蓋藥是醫者唯一工具，非此不爲功。</p>
<p>年來科學救國之聲，雖已高唱入雲。然統計每年流巵卻有增無減，各帝國主義者的藥商，已侵入了我國陣地。國人若再不謀自拔，急起謀國藥業之發展，以外國的侵略拼之境外：則中國之亡不久矣。茲述其所以薄弱之原因：</p>
<p>（一）資本家不願投資藥廠</p>
<p>這也是因國人智識薄弱，叨時代潮流，發生謬悟觀念。情願把有用的金錢存入外國銀行。供他們利用。就是會利用的中國可憐的富人，只知投資舊藥業或其他；卻不投資於藥廠。</p>
<p>近來國內雖有比較稍有規模的藥廠若新亞信誼民生等大有蓬勃之新氣象，然還不足供國內所需要之萬一，在下願資本家把存入銀行之金錢盡量投資藥廠，使其如雨後春筍般不絕地產生，而範圍逐漸擴大以供國人需要，務以一絲一毫不仰仗外國爲原則。</p>
<p>（二）受洋化醫師之影響</p>
<p>此類醫師因受所留學之國之影響，返國後無一不力求其洋化，用藥當亦不洋不爲快，視國物名藥爲不值錢，不肯應用。如留德的盡力推銷德藥，留日的盡力推銷日藥等皆是以影響國藥的發展。</p>
<p>（三）拜外心理之惡勢力之關係。</p>
<p>提倡國貨之聲，早已振遍了全國，然有些甘爲做洋奴，做亡國奴的人們，遍地皆有，以爲「中國貨總不及外貨」—於是國內藥廠亦受了影響。</p>
<p>（四）同業競爭之弊</p>
<p>國人眼光不大，只知某藥能發財，便你也效尤他也仿製，粗製仿造，弄得存貨過剩，互相削價競爭，結果俱弄得焦頭爛額。</p>
<p>（五）不知進取之弊</p>
<p>因國內缺乏專門藥才，故對於藥物，只求蠅頭微利，不作進一步的研製，以求發展。</p>
<p>綜上以觀已略可窺見中國醫業的病態，願先進們加以對癥下藥，使它健全起來，則中國醫業發展可期。中國幸甚！</p>

<h3>止痛的醫學（二）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>痛的總知感機管是在大腦當中的生部分。例如，心痛。心的一部分受傷（由心病或外傷）心肌肉中間的神經接觸器就由腦缐將感覺傳到脊骨中的脊腦，再由脊腦傳到大腦，於是就有了心痛的知覺。（圖中箭頭方向代表痛感覺在神經系中傳遞的方向。）若是這種感覺傳不到大腦，心就是受了傷也不曉得痛。再比如，胃內生瘡痛，是胃瘡破處受的激刺由腦缐經脊腦繼傳到大腦，胃痛就在大腦當中發覺了。（見圖）。其餘如膽囊痛，腎石絞痛，腸絞痛，痛的感覺傳遞方法都是一樣。現在再拿皮膚痛爲例：皮受傷，皮膚處的神經接觸器就將感覺由很長的腦缐傳到脊腦，繼經幾部神經才傳到大腦。由試騐證明神經感覺在腦腺當中傳遞每秒鐘速度爲五十至八十公盡，從手指到大腦距離大約一公尺，故傳遞感覺由手指到大腦頂長費時五十分之一秒。比方，皮膚受傷處神經接觸器不靈了，因沒有感覺傳到大腦就覺不到痛。若接觸器好，腦缐斷了也不會覺到痛。假設別部完好，但脊腦或大腦下部分，或大腦司痛部分生了毛病也就覺不到痛。現在拿電話來做比喻。一個人拿聽筒來打電話。這個聽筒就比如神經接觸器。打電話的一發聲，聲就由受音器經電缐（如腦缐）先至電話局（如脊腦與大腦下部神經司），再由電話局到受話者。受話者（如大腦）就可知道所講的。假設任何部分發生毛病消息就不會達到。</p>
<p>痛覺的接觸器全身任何部分都有。不管何處剌一小針就要至少碰到一個接觸器。皮膚痛很容易覺到在何處。至於內臓痛的地位蠅不清楚的。例如，肝胃痛不很容易覺到一定是肝痛或是胃痛。牙痛也與內臓痛相同，故牙痛每覺到面皮膚痛。再者痛覺也是人一切知覺中最末了失去的，即任何知覺都停止了但還有痛覺。</p>
<p>痛的種類痛有平和性的也有猛烈性的。有以下的專門名辭以便形容各種疼痛。（一）鈍痛（或作悶痛）是長時間的，繼續不斷的，不過厲害。（一）利痛（或作急痛）痛的非常厲害。（三）剌痛（痛如刀剌）。（四）射痛如槍子穿痛。（五）捕痛（或作跳痛）一跳一跳的痛（六）拉痛痛如重物下墜似的。（七）饑痛肚餓時痛。（八）放射痛病於一點痛散開一大部分。（九）反射痛即有病處反射痛至無病處使無病處亦痛。反射痛既是無病處痛故晨易誤治。</p>
<p>反射痛最好的一個例即十二指腸瘡痛常覺到頭底與右肩骨上痛（見第二圖）。我們曉得十二指腸與頸相離很遠，但這一類的痛就呌做反射痛。其原因爲腦腺接聯的關係。其餘反射痛如膽囊或膽管痛時背後右肩下面亦痛（見第二第三圖）。賢痛時腰部皮膚亦痛（見第二圖）。婦女子宮痛或大腸肛門內部痛同時也反射到背下部（見第二圖）。再如賢內或輸管內有石絞痛時同時也有反射痛在同邊的睪丸（見第三圖）。其餘腹部上面所表顯的反射痛，如小腸痛時發現在肚臍處（見第三圖）。盲腸痛在肚臍與右腸骨中間。大腸痛反射在小腹部（見第三圖）。反射痛的部分並不是因毛病痛，不過是由腦缐接聯反應的作用。這是很平常的産痛故明白這些理由也是相當價值的。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（五十三）敗血癥</p>
<p>Sepsisi　Septicaemia（下）</p>
<p>（問）發生敗血癥的時候，運動器中起什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）運動器中最多發生的病狀，是關節炎。大都侵犯許多關節或有單侵一個關節的。結果起關節周圍膿瘍，骨膜炎，或骨髓炎等。此外還有發生化膿性肌炎或蜂窠織炎。</p>
<p>（問）呼吸器中，起什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）呼吸器中，起咽峽炎，支氣管炎，肺炎，肺膿瘍，化膿性肋膜炎等。</p>
<p>（問）消化器中，起什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）消化器中的病狀，是舌面乾燥，舌苔黑色如煤，食慾不振，惡心，哎吐：有時還有起敗血癥性的匯瀉。此外有肝腫賬，肝膿瘍等。脾臟也有腫賬的。</p>
<p>（問）視覺器起變化嗎？</p>
<p>（答）也起很大的變化。像綱膜出血，綱膜白斑；此外還有視神經炎，敗血癥性眼球炎。</p>
<p>（問）賢臟有什麼病狀？</p>

<p>（答）傷寒癥沒有脈搏頻數，白血球增多，關節腫脹皮膚和綱膜出血的。</p>
<p>（問）和腦膜炎，怎樣鑑別？</p>
<p>（答）腦膜炎時沒有脾腫，心包炎。又腦脊體液在敗血癥時正常。</p>
<p>（問）和粟粒結核，怎樣鑑別？</p>
<p>（答）粟粒結核時，一定有脈絡膜結核，及其他種種結核病窀的。</p>
<p>（問）和急性關節炎，怎樣鑑別？</p>
<p>（答）急性關節炎時，沒有皮膚出血和脾腫等。</p>
<p>（問）此外還要和那幾種病應該區別？</p>
<p>（答）應該和肺炎，惡性㿖或尿毒癥相區別。</p>
<p>（問）敗血癥的預後，是否危險？</p>
<p>（答）非常危險。</p>
<p>（問）敗血癥的治療方法，怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）可注射抗鏈球菌血清，或多價血清，膠狀銀液，脫呂帕弗垃文液。內服Optochin。此外注射生理食鹽水，或放血後行輸血法。並注射強心劑。（完）</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十四）猩紅熱（續）</p>
<p>（六）猩紅熱對於循環器的影響Ⅱ在猩紅熱的經過中。往往可以惹起急性心內膜炎，心筯炎，或心囊炎。</p>
<p>（七）猩紅熱對於神經系統的影響Ⅱ在體溫高度的時候。常有藝語，不安不眠等現象。若在小兒。則屢起痙攣的發作。或竟患腦膜炎。而遭不測。</p>
<p>猩紅熱究屬危險麼……從前一般人。並不知道猩紅熱。是一種急性發疹傳染病。祇當作爲痧痘痘一類的疾病。所以才有紅痧等名稱定出來（關於名稱一節上次已經詳細講過）。也不顧及危險兩的兩個字。但是現在呢。人人都已認識了猩紅熱。知道他是一種急性發疹傳染病。也明白他的危險。講到猩紅熱的死亡率。本來未必可以數自來表示。因爲是有差異的。尋常的統計。是百分之二至百分之八。不過這種百分率是由流行的性質，個人的抵抗力，全身感染情形人的年齡，和合併癥的輕重而有上下的。譬如是一種出紅性猩紅熱。那就一定有生命的危險。又若合併猩紅熱腎性炎臓。或犯腦癥狀。或起循環器變化。則亦常危險。</p>
<p>猩紅熱的預防……本病的傳染力。特別強大。所以在有本病嫌疑的時候。應當立刻送院隔離。萬一因種種關係。而不便送院的時候。也當就家庭中。實施隔離。謝絕親友的訪問。避去一切傳染的機會。病人的衣服，臥床，書籍，玩具等物。均宣嚴密消毒。更若病人的分泌物和排匯物。像眼涙，鼻涕，痰唾，大小便，上皮落屑等等。應當十分注意消毒排除。</p>
<p>猩紅熱病毒侵入的門戶。我已經說過。大概是從口蓋扁桃腺（俗稱乳蛾）。如果口蓋扁桃腺一旦發生肥大癥。那就是開放門戶的表示。病毒也就容易侵入。口蓋扁桃腺肥大癥最易感染的年齡。是和猩紅熱一樣的。也是五歲左右的小兒。所以我有一個主見。就是遇有五歲左右的小兒。患著口蓋扁桃腺肥大癥的時候。家長應當囑托專科醫師診察決定。將那肥大的口蓋桃腺施行切除。如是既可剷除猩紅熱病毒侵入的門戶。又得減少一切扁桃腺的疾病。</p>
<p>猩紅熱的治療……猩紅熱的一般治療。也和一般的傳染病相同。病室應當選擇空氣流通而廣大的。食物宜取流動而鐵於消化的注意口腔的衛生。最近確實主要的治療方法。就是早期注射猩紅熱連鎖狀球菌血清。注射若得其當。大都即可轉危爲安愈。本病在經過中的第三星期。應當時常檢查小便。觀察蛋白質的有無。這是早期預防賢臟炎的要道。再猩紅熱治愈後。應使病人至少繼續隔離靜臥二星期。千萬不可即將和健康人往來。這種條例，在有組織的衛生行政機關。是早有規定的。（完）</p>

<h3>肺結核淺說（四一）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第九章　臨床上的經過</p>
<p>蘭克氏第一期本病，在臨床上究竟有何等的癥象呢？這在從前的醫學界，都會不約而的答個「否字。關於期集合的認識，完全係在他痊愈後，憑藉愛克司光的助力，方可得其一二的。換一句話說，就是：在臨床上係亮無癥象發現的。最近纔知道是並不盡然的。Ｘ光方面的檢查，既有很顯著的進步，臨床方面的例證，也是很習見的。開始時的情形，和流行感冒癥很類似，溫度增高，數天後即綏緩回復原狀，病者無咳嗽，無痰，祇稍覺疲倦，物理和血的檢查，都無特珠異點。但Ｘ光的檢查，係確有留影可證明的。此病灶大都無須特殊治療，即會停止進行的。肺部裹面的腺體，也很多殃及的：但如果病灶係痊愈了，他也會停止進展而潛伏的。此中的詳情，留待肺門腺體結核一節裹面再講。</p>
<p>在肺門腺體左近，如果發生次期侵潤狀態了，這在病灶方面的範圍，當然是較初期集合爲廣大的；就是Ｘ光的檢查，也有相當證實的。但在臨床方面係毫無異處的。那末，現在祇能提到早期診斷一方面了！這方面的基本型式，有肺門腺體結核，獨立的侵潤與中視野侵潤，肺尖結核，三種。關於他們的詳情，我現在且一一分述在下面：</p>
<p>Ａ在肺門腺體結核一方面，最令大引起注意的，自莫過於氣管枝腺體結核了！他是在小兒年齡發生最多，幾乎是由他們包辦似的；在大人方面是比較鮮見的。他的臨床上癥象，可特殊提出的也不多；像顏色蒼白，不快樂，無秩序的溫度增高或減低，脈捕頻數，等情；都可以由別的原因而發生的。比較顯著一點的，就是咳整時帶痙攣性，和百日咳一癥很類似的；這大致因氣管分枝處受重壓所致。吸氣音是較長，帶吹笛音，這是物理檢查所僅見的。至於大人方面患此者，大都因疲倦，胃部劇痛，心跳，等而就醫，這是和小兒所患完全異樣的。他在臨床上的癥象，雖或有或無，毫無馮藉，但在Ｘ光方面的檢查，是非常顯著的。甚至腺體腫賬的大小形式，都可據此留影而得其大概的。此外，鐵勃固靈的反應大半是正號，這也是很有力量的旁證。我們不妨大膽的說一句；就是；在鐵勃固靈反應現在號的小孩，如無其他癥灶之發現，簡直可認爲氣管枝腺體結核無疑。本病經過的情形，無論大人小孩，大半都很良好，所以預後也不能說是壞。但如果患者發生麻癥百日咳等病時，他的病勢也會因此蔓延肺部，而趨於惡劣的。就是帶乾酪性的腺體組織，有時因穿破血管的原因，結果也會發生急性粟粒結核，以陷於不治的。但這種情形究竟是少數；大體上說起來，他的合併癥發生，比較別的總還是佔少數。（未完）</p>

<h3>論欠賦拘禁</h3>
<p>— 吳顧毓</p>
<p>一　引言</p>
<p>素以消極無爲的政治以治理的中國，遞濱之於今日，農業社會賴以先決生產要素的土地問題，在我們一向注中國問題的目光中，從來沒有放鬆過。關於這方面的問題，在我們混朦的抽象的想象中，要謀一個解決方法，卻是一個可望而不可即的東西：國家財政因範而發生種種微收上的不平和困難，常施以一種不顧實情的手段，是常見的事；況且在其本身上的矛盾，真是無法去發生決力量。</p>
<p>昨天有一位故鄉——嘉興的朋友來醫，現在把它節錄在下面：</p>
<p>「……緣我鄉田畝，在民國二十年以前，每畝收入除繳稅外，可凈得大洋約二元半左右，迨二十年後，米價頻跌，附加稅日增，洎乎去年，幾至蝕本。去年收入平均每畝收租四斗七升，糙米每擔價四元半，則約合計洋二元一角強；支出方面，每畝完繳正附稅一元八角八分，外加收租時舟人二開支共計約一元九角強；收支相抵，每畝凈餘僅二角許。試問昔日之擁困五百畝而賴以生活者，今將何以爲活？（上述猶以一般較好者而言，若弟因去年不在家，收入大減，兩抵虧蝕約每畝四五角。）抑有使人難堪者，即催賦稅，更日急一日，弟頻年共欠田賦已達六七百元，此日正難應付，如再置諸不睬，誠恐拘票即在眼前，故月內即設法避住他處，以避鋒芒。……而縣府之催徵猶動輒拘禁，於法合乎？」</p>
<p>在這簡短的報告中，我的朋友是馬上要設法遷居「避稅」去了！還問我欠賦拘禁於法律上合不合。這句問話，本來只要用一句很簡短的回答，但是我在此地，不欲以這個現行法令問題爲討論中心，是要討論這個問題本身上的嚴重性。</p>
<p>二　地主之苛例及催微之黑幕略述</p>
<p>中國土地支配之形態，一向沒有進步的法律去支配它，所以成爲鄉村人可以自由支配的東西。這不僅在經濟作用上不顧到國家社會利用土地的義務而是去自由支配，就是在地權的關係上，也因爲太自由而變成一個極複雜的現象。我們只要從田底權，田面權，典權，典租，半邊田，永田權等等這些名詞裹，可以看出中國的地權問題，也是如何地複雜了。</p>
<p>這裹的篇幅是有限的，我們敢扯大來去討論，只要了解這個問題是千頭萬緒，而又是目前中國的嚴重大問題。現在我們只從簡單的土地的社會關係上，分地主和佃農兩面來閘說。</p>
<p>和土地發生密切關係的人，大概有下列二種，就是：地主和佃戶。在法律上看來，地主就是所有人，依民法第七六五條的規定，他對於所有物有自由使用收益處分的權利；如果他自已不使用所有物，就可以憑自由處分的權利以獲得收益爲條件，給別人使用。佃戶就是依民法第八四二條的規定，以支付佃租，永久在他人土地上爲耕作或畜牧之權。因爲要限止地主撤佃或佃戶退佃的緣故，所以就有永佃權的成立。餘外還有一個種戶，他在民法第八三二條的規定是：以在他人土地上有…………工作物…………爲目的而使用其他地上之權，所以他是享有地上權的人。地主即所謂有田底權，佃戶即所謂有田而權。從這上面觀察，在地主和佃戶間。大家有同等的權利，並不見得有不平等的關係。</p>
<p>然而我開頭就說，中國一向的政治是消極無爲，佃耕問題素無法律規定，完全由鄉村人民去自由解決；非但各省縣的習同，就是同村中也有不同的辦法。所以地主和佃農在經濟上和社會地位上的不平等，與其說是一種倫理關係的納責，寗肯說是封建方式的不平等的殘留形態。</p>
<p>中國地主對於佃農的佃租率狀況，除了理的錢租和物租以外，苛例的習慣也是盛行的，如（一）以主產物爲奉獻的，若浙江的腳米，江蘇的力米或腳銷，廣東的田信米或伙頭米等。（二）以副產物爲奉獻的，若湖南的稻草，貴州的玉蜀黍租，辣椒租，果子租，江西之薪，湖北之豆，廣東之番薯，蔬菜等。（三）以副業產物爲奉獻的，就中都以鷄鴨之類，若田信鷄，信鷄，伙頭鷄，租鷄，田信鴨，信鴨，伙頭鴨，租鴨，又若浙江之租鵝，廣東，湖南之租魚，豬肉，酒，貴州的租豬，果子，湖北的麥粉等二，（四）以金錢爲奉獻的，若廣東之田信錢，江西的小租錢，遜年錢，江蘇的催早費。（五）以饗宴爲奉獻的，這在佃農興地主成立佃約時，佃租決定詩，佃約更改時，佃約解除時，除招待地主外，其親族，友人，作中人，或立會人等，均須一同饗宴：其習慣略通行於全中國的。佃約成立時的饗宴稱爲認東主或稱租田請莊；佃租決定時的饗宴，稱爲租飯：佃約更改時的饗宴，稱爲向主換討；佃約解除時的饗宴，稱爲退佃酒。（六）以勞力爲奉獻的。中國有不以生產物納付佃租而全以勞力代替納付佃租的地方，若江西省稱爲工租。但此地奉獻勞力，不過是納佃租以外的奉獻於地主以多量的勞力，是一種附加佃租的一種情形。地主對佃農是要供給飯食，沒有酬償罷了。佃農對於地主是認定以勞力爲奉獻的。這種風氣，在河南，江西，貴州，廣東，浙江等省，行之頗廣，每每呼爲僕役，差役，租力，包水柴等。此種勞力在平時利用，則如抬轎，挑水，雜投等；如在葬儀，喜事，搬家，建築時，則服者飯，接待，拉車，上本工事等勞役。（七）以身生命爲奉獻的。這個特殊形，是當在佃租無法納付拖欠太太時，則奉獻妻子於地主爲奴隸，稱爲人事；其他如河南光山縣則有參加械門等。</p>
<p>上面的地主對於佃農的苛例狀況，也不過是一個大概情形，現在還沒有完全的精細調查。不過從這裹可以看出：在經濟原則上，總是說不過去的苛酷條件。雖然地主方面，因爲有受增加賦稅的政治上的壓迫，不得不轉嫁於佃農，也大概是一種原因吧！</p>
<p>中國的官吏，只要不擾民，就是說：只要純粹的消極無爲就是好；若消楫無爲而更再擾民，就是壞官。鄉人對於官吏是懼若豺狼敬若神祇的，據我所知道；我的故鄉的較大些的地主，在民國二十年前，在佃農們的眼光中是看成神祇然的尊敬的；而且衙門裹人——催微人員見地主們有錢有勢，也不敢奈何的。即時的碰船頭（催微人下鄉以拘人爲恐嚇而籍此敲詐中飩者叫磅船頭）都是向自農或佃戶說的。書吏們大都他雜有田地，許多地主勾結著催微人，有不少依勢社辦佃農的。據確實調查者說：江浙兩省有的地方，地主可以自由拘留佃戶逼租，或請求縣政府收押佃戶。江蘇的吳縣，地主有押佃所的設立，可向縣政府取得空白拘票，自由拘押佃戶。此外各縣還有田業公會追租局等名目，是由縣政府派人替地主追租，甚至於這種局會可以自由答打佃農。</p>
<p>寫到這裹，已說到向農民的催片情形。我們又很深切的見到各縣的微收田賦，本來是一篇糊塗賬自。記得在民國二十年，浙江的財務人員養成所派學生到各縣政府實習，有幾個不敢忽略的學生要請求糧概調閱微收處賬簿，當事人明言不能輕率公開，因爲要引起外界非議等話。今年二月三日的上海時報，竟有這樣一節嘉興財政局糧價微收處主任高禹村吞欵匿跡滬上拘捕未獲的新聞：</p>
<p>「嘉興人高禹村，前在嘉興財政局充任糧櫃徵收處主任之職，因爲侵占公欵四萬餘元，棄職潛逃之嫌疑。被局長查悉，咨請當地機關注意查緝，茲經王局長偵得高若居上海……乃函請縣政府移主上海市公安局轉表第一特院簽出拘票……諜高禹村已聞風逃匿。……高禹村因侵占公欵四萬餘元潛逃，故著令查緝，今高禹村既已聞風遠逃，乃將其子高安可逮捕，因其父係侵占國家公欵，則其子因負責任云云……」</p>
<p>又定縣開第二屆鄉村工作討論會，蘭谿實騐縣長胡次威先生的報告，在本月四日的大公報有：</p>
<p>「……魚鱗冊於同治五年，曾經編查一次，寫存九百本，存於縣署，因歷年較久，現已遣失四百本，當時編造魚鱗冊，共用冊書三○二人，此項冊書，平日即任爲縣府催徵錢糧之事，名曰糧書，於編查魚鱗冊時，此輩冊書即各留本人所管之一部，作徵收錢糧之根據，於魚鱗冊以外，各冊書又自編歸付冊一種，遇田畝過戶時，冊書均隨時記入歸付冊中，合魚鱗冊歸付冊分別記載，即可知田畝變遷經過，某地初屬某姓，現屬某姓，縣府之魚鱗冊無從考查者，均可於糧書私有之歸付冊中查得，惟此項歸付冊在糧書視之，爲其衣食所在，不傳之秘，因縣府不知之地主，彼均知之，故歷任縣長索抄，均不肯交出……」</p>
<p>我很留心引徵這些事實，就是要切實證明中國的田賦，類皆不能按固定數目徵收。基本根據的魚鱗冊，還是同治年間的東西，而且是落在微收人員的手裹爲多，假使做縣長的本來不是爲民，那一位官大人想到去查一查，實顧著宦途的風浪還來不及，困循復因循，欠賦早已成了一致的通病了。尤其好笑的，嘉興的微收主任高禹村沒吞的四萬多元，後來完全沒有拔轉來的好消息。</p>
<p>各縣微收田賦，原則上是「花戶」因往來不便或農忙而不克分身，有由鄉村地保代交納者。地保對委旗人所交之欵，全數交糧者當然也有，然從而侵蝕者，亦不鮮見，蓋鄉人向重視串票——完納田賦收據，因此亦無從稽查。至於現在之催微吏（河北今名之曰政務警，即昔之里書）也是負代完田賦之責。總之，不管地保或催微吏代納，其中都有中飽之弊。聞冀省有鄉人以其所應納之部分交「村役」後即不復過問；村役亦知鄉人之不過問，恒不以全數交微糧手，時村役以此欺交奉命權微之政分警，亦　　　　　政務警更難免效村役之從中剝削，甚或彼此勾通，雙方中飽者。有時政務警下鄉催討，鄉人稍有抗拒輒遭遠捕，若稍予賄賂，即可釋出；然此開釋之有效期間，恒以賄賂之多寡成正比例，如是者再再十數次，催徵者私衰早滿，而花戶仍是欠賦，實在其所費賄賂已大於應納之賦矣。</p>
<p>三、今日擁有田產之苦況</p>
<p>綜上的一節話，無非是證明中國財政的瞞上肥下，節節相制，重重剝削的黑漆事實，微收田賦猶如一堆亂麻，及其社會關係的無政府狀態。但我們要注意下面的一段話，就是；凡是一個社會的秩序，不管它內在有階級對立與否，有重重剝削與否，相互牽製與否；總之，只要是一個秩序安穩的確立著，雖然它裹面或許充滿著不平等的形態，與無天良的無理性的行爲。大概只要是形成的秩序，總不致發生什麼問題的。</p>
<p>可是時代之輪把中國捲了進去，靜態的社會受了外力的振蕩，壓迫，引誘，而急轉著，起了化學作用。試看今日的狀況，是不是閉關自守以前的所謂「周期的亂」？</p>
<p>我們不能在這裹討論這個整個中國今日的亂的大問題，只能收在我們的本題上來，討論今日擁有田產的苦況。不過要明白今晶中國的亂是外部引發的。與古來的亂絕對不同。</p>
<p>照前面的友人信上看：就能見出擁有田產的地主們苦況的因子：（一）米價頻跌，（二）附稅日增，還有一點是二五減租以後的，（三）收入大減，我們姑且依照他的算法，先請看一家擁田五百畝者地主的家庭經濟狀況：</p>
<p>擁有五百畝的人家，不可不算大地主，在以前的凈餘收入是（500畝×2.5元1250.00元）一千二百五十元，與現在六十七元五角相比，相差（12350.00:67.50=16.5）十八倍半，這還據說是一般的較好狀態者，也不過餘剩六十七元五角。就是再照他說每畝最多凈餘剩六十七元五角。就是再照他說每畝最多凈餘二角強，則五百畝還只有一百多元，況且五百畝　的人家，一定有不少的入口和排場，甚或許是大家庭，若仍是守產過活，真不知生命是如何去延續？</p>
<p>我還有一個朋友某君，是嘉北數一數二的大田主，擁田達三千畝許，可是在他與我的談話中是如下的意思：</p>
<p>也是一樣的最高估計，每畝可凈餘二角強，則三千畝當有六百多元的收入。巧不巧他的田處在蘇嘉公路的區域，有很長一條爲公路路基，在築路的那一年，因爲不能種，租戶們當然不還租，不過那一年的銀糧卻不可不完。第二年銀糧可以不完納了，然而問題又來了，築公路後，在路的兩旁都被挖出了坭以堤築路基，變成要長水潭；在長水潭區域裹的田，當然不能再向租戶要租，可是依縣政府裹的算法，除路基以外，水潭區域仍須納糧。路基區的田或許還有一綫希望向政府取田正攤還的地價，但是長水潭區域是不能收租，仍舊納糧和不能取回攤還地價。這種毫不顧到實際情形的當袖，簡直要人民無中生有來納稅，我實在不明白今日的中國有這樣不合理的事情。</p>
<p>雖然後者的現象比較特殊些，不過公路是很長的，其數當然不小吧！自然還有些小農們因此而完全傾產的。可是前者的苦況實在太普遍了，那是再也不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>兼之今年江南亢旱爲災，聽說朡懷嬰孩手提竹籃的新增乞焉充塞街市，當軸者未曾顧　慮到這一大批的基本產業軍也不？</p>
<p>漩渦裹的地主是擁田多，蝕得多，家裹不能不開銷，收入不足，自然只有欠賦：前年加上年，上年再加今年，滾滾存存，欠得頭昏眼花的比比皆是。從前以爲「田」是「富」之根，今日已目爲「累」之首了。</p>
<p>這樣嚴重的欠賦問題，有沒有轉圓的地步使地主償清呢？</p>
<p>「田」在地主眼裹早已看成「累」之首，據說有一個因被遍催得實在太緊，他向縣政府請求，願意「出田抵賦，」當時有某縣長倒以爲也是一個辦法，竟毫不考慮的接受下來。不料此例才開，許許多多的地主們都要照辦。道個問題在「無路走」的中國政府那裹有預定的政策去解決，結果「出田抵賦」的法子又不成功。</p>
<p>總而言之，際此天災連年，人過交流的今日，農民已是不怕你來拉船頭了，反而把坐牢監當作一件求之不得的解決生活之路，地主們已怨恨擁田之苦，奉送田地也是情願。嗟乎！世界上竟有甘心坐牢與奉送產業的人民之國家乎！</p>

<h3>去年中國對外貿易之回顧</h3>
<p>— 慶麟</p>
<p>去年國內經濟情況，南北以水旱爲災，農產歉收。工商復受外貨競叟，及人民購買力薄弱，幾瀕破產。同時復受國外銀價高漲，白銀外流不絕，致金融枯竭，大有江河日下之勢，經濟危機之嚴重可知，欲求對外貿易之興盛，其可得乎？試觀去年海關報告，全年貿易總額爲一、○二九、六六五、二二四元、較二十二年之一、三四五、五六七、一八八元、固減低三萬萬元、約百分之二○·○五矣。進口方面減少百分之二三·四七·出口減少一二·五二。全年入超爲四萬九千四百餘萬元、較二十二年之七萬三千三百餘萬，固減少甚鉅，此可證明國內經濟情形之不佳，然實行新稅則，亦不無關係耳。茲將各月貿易額列後，以覘趨勢之一班：</p>
<p>就上表所列面分言之，如一月份爲最高，二月爲廢歷年關，向爲淡月，三月至六月漸復舊觀，各月入超均在一萬萬元左右自七月一日實行新稅則後，較以前各月降低·至十一月份又復回高，進口較十月增百分之六，出口增加百分之十六，此種特殊現象，半由於季節關係，半由於外匯順利之故，是以未能持久，遠十二月又復下降，爲去年全年最低一月之紀錄。</p>
<p>自一九二九年世界經濟不景氣以來，吾國已受其影響。如據海關統計去年之貿易總額，較諸一九二九年已減至百分之五六，茲列各年進出口表如后：（單位百萬元）</p>
<p>然上表所列僞滿之對外貿易數字，尚在其中，故欲觀整個貿易之趨勢，究屬們正確。且東省產豆至豐，往常均屬出超，爲比較計，自不得不將一九二九至一九三二年東省數字除去，以昭正確。列表如左：</p>
<p>從上表觀之，則中國對外貿易總數之低落爲百分之四一，非百分之五六，進口低落百分之三六，出口減少百分之五○耳。年來貿易低落最顯著之原因，厥爲美國經濟之不景氣，使世界捲入漩渦，此種影響之衰落及於我國，當在一九三三年，今則愈形嚴重。在一九三二年進口驟減百分之二四，出口幾及百分之三八，去年則進出口雙方均繼續減退，本年初尚無任何進展也，然各國以努力救濟，漸呈昭蘇之象，我則何如？</p>
<p>一九三四年之入超，較之過去五年均有減少，故，般持我國欲改進其經濟及財政地位，勢非達到進出口貿，易平衡不可者，頗多樂觀，蓋去年較二十三年入超，計減少二萬三千九百餘萬元，若去年再能增加進口稅，容或再可減低洋貨之輸入也。</p>
<p>去年貿易國別之最足注意者，爲英國之降至第三位，而日本則躍居其上，惟美國則仍占首席，其進口額倍於他國，而我國對美出口較二十二年爲減少，對英國則進出口均有增加。德國及荷屬東印亦有增加。惟澳洲則減退甚鉅。蓋前年澳洲輸入粉麥尚巨，後以棉麥借欵恊定之故，遂受打擊，然該恊定已告結束，預料澳洲復有競爭之機會也。茲列主要貿易國及所百分率如后：</p>
<p>進口與出口貿易，在去年進口數三一五，九○一，五六四九，中僅有下列七種進口貨，較前年增加；計機器工具類增一六，一七三，三○九元，煙草四，三四六，五一六元，雜貨三，五七一，九二三元，手及毛織品二，一九五，六九○元，金屬及鑛砂一，九七一，一一○元，交通用具七○四，八四○元，蔴及蔴製品五二九，○四一元。進口貨中減少者，亦有下列數種：計雜糧等較二十二年減一六二，七九六，二八三元，皂油等類五九，○一八，二六五元，棉織品三四，四七三，九八一元，雜類金屬一九，六六三，一一五元，煤烯料等一一，二九七，六四一元，化學藥品九，七四一，九六七元，糖九，五六二，四七一元，棉花八，七一一，○四三元，絲及絲織品六，二一二，五九○元，書籍地圖等六，三二七，八六三元。</p>
<p>去年就進口方面而言，首推棉織物，及雜糧，油濁油，機器，金屬，等項爲最巨，次之爲交通用具，及糖，煙草，化學產品，染料，顏料，書籍，等等。出口方面以生熟皮貨，紡織品，茶，等爲最巨，次之當推油蠟，雜糧，等項。</p>
<p>至去年之商品貿易，較之前年大致無甚差異，然出口貨中絲經之大減，茶之大增，均值得研究。入口貨中如機器五金之增加，亦未始非良好現象也。此後如何，端在吾人之善自處理耳！</p>
<p>總之，吾國經濟之日趨危殆，無可諱言，而貿易之衰落，尤在意中之事。茍欲圖振興之計，自非根本著手於農村復興，重要工業之援助不可。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （何哉）</p>
<p>聰明人常常說：「傻子也會說聰明話，」其實會說聰明話的傻子，在那說話的時候，他比聰明大還要聰明。</p>
<p>聰明人到了明知自已做了事或者說錯了話。而不承認是錯誤的時候，他已經變成傻子而不自覺。</p>
<p>只有知錯認錯走進一步，獲得人們的更加信仰的聰明人，才是十足的聰明人。</p>
<p>聰明人常常利用謾罵的方法來壓服對方，可是不但不會壓服對方，反而使對方認識了你，是淺薄無恥的，對於你只有不理會。然而聰明人一看對方置之不理以爲自已勝利了，得意洋洋，更表現出聰明人已經變成了傻子。</p>
<h3>元宵陳語</h3>
<p>— 片月</p>
<p>俗傳正月半喫年糕，呌做撐腰糕。喫了一年四季腰腳輕健的。我想：元宵節是瓣年景致的終了期，從此如樂結束，工作認真，——卻有寓意，節前任憑「放開肚皮喫飯」，節後須得「撐起腰板做人」呢。</p>
<p>普通習慣，描摹飮食服用的奢華狀況，常言道：「朝朝寒食，夜夜元宵。」其實，寒食節是清明的前一天：舊俗，這天爲紀念春秋時代的介之推的避祿高風，家家舉火的，夜夜像元宵一般光景，果然熱鬧，若說朝朝像寒食節那麼的清冷，豈不十分凄慘！有好多尋常說的語句，實和原意相反，並有自相違背，這是一例。</p>
<p>朱淑真，一位難得的女詞家，作了生查子一詞，被人訾議。那詞道：「去年元夜時，花市燈如畫。月上柳梢頭，人約黃昏後。今年夜時，月與燈依舊。不見去年人，涙滿春衫袖！」這詞抒寫一個佳節上的一件變愛故事。作者列在超然的地位。何必武斷那作品裹所描敘的，定是作者自道？爲什麼女作家便不該作變愛的描寫，因此牽涉到伊的人格問題？前代人批評藝術作品的目光是這樣的淺陋和歪曲！還有人說這詞是歐陽修作的，要替淑真洗刷，算是意存忠厚；那意識的歪曲相同，又無端的剝奪伊的著作權，實也大可不必。</p>
<h3>一幅古畫</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>人的個性不同，嗜好也各有別，像我的朋友黃先生，最喜玩弄書畫，當代名人的好作品，收藏很見豐富，他的書齋之中，有四體字屏：有四體畫屏：更有曾農髯，譚澤團，黃小癡，白龍山人，吳昌碩……諸名人的書畫。走到他的書齋內，好似走到了書畫屏覽室裹，琳瑯滿目，美不勝收。</p>
<p>假使遇到有同癖的人，他更不厭麻煩地把收藏在書畫箱內的古畫，一幅幅的搬運出來，給你賞鑑和批評，並且備了很精美的肴饌，留你對酌論畫。如果來人贊美幾句，他列受龍若驚的把你引爲生平第一知已。殷懃欵待，以黃先生的朋友特別多，正有小孟嘗的風度。</p>
<p>可是他有一個怪癖，見到人家有一幅古畫被他所賞識了，他總要千方百計的掠爲已有。一天在陳某家中見到一幅古畫·是唐寅的手筆，但是這畫已破舊不堪了。陳家本是書香門第，因受天災人禍，家道中落。黃先生央人去向這人家買這幅畫。豈知陳某不允。他就出了一百金，賄通一個小宵。把這畫窮取了，並且懇這小宵留一字條放了三百元的代價。次晨，陳某發見古畫被竊，又有三百元的代價，也就馬馬虎虎了。現在陳家已絕了代，這事纔由他吐露出來，或可算得空前絕後的雅事吧！</p>
<h3>榮歸</h3>
<p>— 隱涓</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咤未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>他下面雖不是完全天腳，卻是和男人一樣穿了扁頭鞋，大概是布襪子裹面，還緊緊的裹著包腳布呢。因笑向胡氏道：這樣看起來，那邊包腳的風氣是很厲害的了，怎麼你的姑娘，又沒有包腳呢？胡氏道：我們那裹的縣老斧管得緊，不許我們家女孩子包腳，後來老爺管得鬆了，腳又包不起來，也就只好罷了。我就想到這是怪難看的。不過到了西安來，我才曉得不要緊，這裹不包腳的姑娘，不是很多嗎，月英聽到母親論他的腳，他很不高興，撅了嘴，只管向後退，就退到桌子邊的墻角落裹去。介夫道：你這位大嫂，我勸你就不必作幫工的打算了。你想，誰家裹肯找一個跑著做事的用人呢？胡氏道：那要什麼緊？他要作的什麼事情，我都給他作出來就完了。我跪著不跪著，與他無干啦。介夫聽他的口音，好像是有些不信任自已的話。就是東方人士所聽到跪倒作工，是一種奇談，在胡氏心裹，必以爲是理之當然。於是向他笑道：但願能夠趁你們的心願，那豈不是更好？你在我這裹等一等罷，我託茶房和你去通知程老斧一聲。於是打開箱子，取出了兩張名片，都放在桌上，在身上取出手絹，輕輕的指拭了一陣。然後在一張反面，用小字筆，工工整整的寫了幾行字道：志前先生臺鑒：朱胡氏母女，現在弟處，等候音信，再普　　否介紹弟與高廳長一個另外一張，乃是預備志前替他遞給高廳長的，寫好了，把茶房呌來，將自已的意思，囑咐一陣，呌他馬上回信。（一三五）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這真是一個特殊思恩典啊！原來每次唱戲，所有的節目十九都是太后自已指定的，不但我們這些女官從不曾享過這種特權，便是光緒，降裕，以及一般公主福晉之類，也是很難得輪到有奉太后懿旨點戲的機會：因爲這也是表示寵眷的意思，決不是隨便什麼人可以盼望得到的！如其有人輪到了點戲：那真和臉上裝了金一樣，大家都會非常艷羨著他了。不過有利必有弊，拆穿了說，這個差使榮耀回然很榮耀，而肩膀上所擔的責任卻也不輕呢！第一是你所點的戲必須沒有什麼犯諱，或於當時的情形不盡適宜的地方；第二便是必須博得太后的愛聽。第一點比較還容易，只須稍微想得周到一些，便不致有什麼問題啦！第二點可就大大的不容易了！然而萬一你所點的戲竟不能引起伊的興趣，這事情便糟了，你所受的羞辱和窘迫，將十倍於你所受的虛榮。想來真是很可慮的！尤其是這幾日，太后的性氣很不好，已使合宮的人都覺得難以度日，假使再觸惱了伊，大家還好說什麼話呢？況且我們不久就要回京去了，誰都希望在離開奉天之前，不要再留下一些不良的印象；於是我就格外的感到困難了。</p>
<p>此刻我雖然要想辭謝這個點戲差使，也已不行了；因爲方才提議唱戲的人便是我，我不點還敎誰點？這真可說是作法自斃了！但我明知懊悔已經不及，只得盡量利用我的腦筯，左思右想的考虛了約莫有七八分鐘模樣；幸而太后也體諒我，知道我是在拚命的搜集枯腸，也就不忍催促；後來，我居然想起了一齣情節很熱鬧的「四郎探母」。（二四六）</p>

<h3>西康省轄之木里王國</h3>
<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>西康的大療就是從前西藏的康地，現在名義上雖是改做一省，可是僻處西陲，劃味未啓，許多士人，依舊過著部落生活。這個位置在賽努麗山斜陂上的木里王國，就是其中的一個。</p>
<p>這小小的木里王國，南邊緊靠著雲南的永寗，向北可以通到打箭爐；他有九千方哩的疆域，兩三萬的臣民，蠻荒萬里，一夫獨尊，賦有無上威權的國王，他的起居供奉，真可算窮極人問的奢慾了！</p>
<p>據說清初用兵西藏的時候，藏地的番人，摩些人，都起來盡力抵抗。惟有森里部落的土酋，壸槳簡食，歡迎王師，博得了清帝的歡心，給他一個王號；世代相襲，一直到現在。</p>
<p>王的宮殿，建築在麗坦河之上，樓閣重疊，金碧輝煌，傍山臨水，風景是再好沒有了。那條麗垣河裹，每年產著豐富的金沙，只有國王可以享受，倘使臣民私行採掘，那就犯了天條，立刻枷死在王宮之前。所以那一般臣民，蟄居於山腳森林裹的小屋中，戰戰憟憟，老是過著愁慘的生活，這是如何地不平等啦！</p>
<p>木里境內，有木里，庫爾，衛雅特三個大寺，每寺由一喇嘛管理，都握有宗敎大權，僅僅亞於國王。國內臣民，奉喇嘛若天神，生有三男，就得捨二男於寺內，只留其一以爲嗣續。喇嘛常著紅衣，戴黃色之冠，因爲也是西藏的黃色宗派。</p>
<p>這個僻隔的小小王囦，四面都被聳峙雲表的高山環繞著，土人智識異常淺薄；一切用物也甚簡陋，死人的骨髏，當做飮食的器皿，牛腿骨，人腿骨，當做喇叭，一切的一切，都表示它是一個草味未啓的部落罷了。</p>
<h3>死狗身後光榮</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>個性</h3>
<p>— 陳田舍</p>
<p>每晚兒總有五六個朋友會敘在一塊，閒談著，有的嗑香水瓜子，有的抽呂宋煙捲，有的吃士產公司的零食，……談吐方面，有的大談女人，有的討論社會科學，有的瞎講笑話……總之，各就性之所好就是。大凡一個人，一定有他的個性的，有的人願乘長風，破萬里浪；有的人忙著功名利祿，富貴榮華：有的人築小齊，養魚種竹玩骨董；……內地有揑鼻煙壹的土老鄉紳，都市有愛牽哈拜狗的摹登小姐；某甲愛好拳術，動輒『耀武揚威』，某乙是『斯文種子』，每談必涉『蘇東坡』以至於『托爾斯泰』，這全是自然的個性表現，不可以勉強的。</p>
<p>我愛吸煙，沒有癮，可是總高興常常去做那套——開聽兒，抽一枝塞在咀兒裹，擦火，吸，彈煙灰——的工作，不慌不忙，雍容閒適，這原是我的個性使然，後來過到一位醫生，詳述吸煙之害，且諄諄勸我戒煙，大約我年紀輕，意志沒堅定的緣故，馬上就聽他的話式了，但每逢　如廁，訪客，宴會的時候，就感到非常乏味，寂寞，痛苦，甚至就像快要生病的樣子，於是，人就對我說了；『朋友；別再硬抑止住你的個性吧，有了鼻子不準你通氣是夠痛苦的，吸煙雖對於你的身子有害，可是，不許你自已的個性自由發洩，這於你身理上的損害，或許會更大吧？！』一想話也有理，我就重開煙禁，還我個性的自由。</p>
<p>憑藉了自已這次的經騐，我就最不歡喜聽朋友向人說：『我從明天起，決不再幹某一件事了，（而這件事，正是他們性所愛好的），決不幹！』或者，再賭一些咒。與其說，這是他改革的決心，不如說，他把自已的個性活生生地囚禁起來，使生活感覺到枯澀。一株生長在山谷的松樹，把它移植到瓦缸裹，就著實有點可憐了。但人們往往喜歡這樣做。</p>
<h3>棄兒</h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>「怎樣辦？已經三天了，再不想辦法，一定要被別人曉得的」。一個二十多歲鄉婦打扮的女人，手中抱著一個生下來祇有幾天的孩子，帶哭帶訴的向著她對面的男人說。</p>
<p>「辦法」？男人的眉頭緊鎖著，死釘著女人手中的孩子；是一個又紅又白，對可愛的胖孩兒。「我何常不想想辦法？沒有錢，有辦法也行不通哩」：男人的臉是鐵青的。</p>
<p>「沒有錢」！女人伏在小孩兒的身上，一呼一吸的啜泣起來。「沒有錢……也得想……沒錢的辦法哩，終不能看著族長開祠堂門打我哩！你們：男人都……是沒良心的……」</p>
<p>「不要哭！不要哭！一哭心就亂了！還是好好的商量吧」。男人拍著女人的肩頭，雙眉更鎖得緊了。「辦法，辦法倒有一個，只……怕你……不願」。男人用了很大的氣力，壓住了眼眶中的涙珠，半吞半吐的說。</p>
<p>「什麼辦法？快說，快說！只要能使這醜事不傳出去，什麼都行！隨你的主意好了。」女人將頭抬起來停止了緊促的啜泣，用袖子揩了一揩眼涙，臉上略略露出了一些紅色，心也寛了許多。</p>
<p>「唉！不好說，說出來罪過得很」！男人的心在絞痛，想說又不想說的躊躇口說了出來：「唉！我想了幾天，除了將小孩兒拋…在屋後…深潭裹，用石…頭沉…在潭…底…」</p>
<p>「這個……」女人不等他說完，搶著說了。</p>
<p>「怎麼？你…不願意？你們男人真狠心…」！</p>
<p>「有別的辦法還要你講！我願意將自已的孩兒…做水…浸鬼…」男人流出了傷心的熱涙。</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>夜，不知在什麼時候偷偷地來到了人間；月亮的光，是陰沉語淡的；天上散佈著島雲，天顯得很低。小星呢，很難看到幾顆；大地好像要隨著黑暗消沉似的。</p>
<p>由茅懷的角落裹，糢糊地像有一個黑影在里動，並且依稀看到向著一個較高的河岸走去。黑影由大而小，由小而消失在一個較遠的黑暗氛圍中。</p>
<p>「嘩……」是什麼東西擊得水聲如此清脆呢？是誰將一個巨石主水中來擊碎黑夜的沉寂麼？</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>女人的頭機械的由床沿上抬了起來，我們可以由昏黃的燈光下看到一雙被涙水浸腫的眼睛，水汪汪地，爛桃子似的。她無力的站了起來，因爲她聽到了異常輕微而又剌耳的擊門聲。</p>
<p>「怎麼…樣…了…」女人倚在牆邊，凝視著站在門外面無人色的男人，渾身軟灘灘地要倒下似的。她看到了男人懷中已沒有了圓臉蛋兒的小天使了。</p>
<p>「還有什…麼好…問，已經和石頭…沉到；潭底…去了…」男人的眼涙像黃豆那麼大一顆，一粒緊壓著一粒連成了一串兒向下掉著：他彷彿還聽到水花「嘩」的一響；彷彿還看到小孩兒在未丟前一剎那在夢中的微笑；彷佛還看到孩兒和巨石擊起的波紋向四面擴大——是那麼有次序的大圈套著小圈一層緊壓著一層的向周圍散云；仿彿……他不能再想了！讓涙水流到鼻一邊，口角，腮上……他像木頭人一樣站著，失掉了知覺似的。他們感到空虛，像失掉了生命中的某一部份一樣，二人默默無言的相互凝視著，對泣著，直到鄰家的雄鷄一聲嘶啼，才將他們由另一個思潮中拉了回來；「我去了！站久了怕給…人看見…」男人衰敗的反轉了身，向著一叢小樹林走了去；女人微微的啜泣聲，鎔化在慘白的晨霧裹。</p>
<h3>春草篇</h3>
<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>春天的小草又參差地飄指在靜溪邊了，生的氣息是並不一定要用紅紫的富貴色來裝飾它的啊——而，遊息在草芽上的春天，又有誰能發現它裹面的暖氣呢？</p>
<p>乃在一些不知數的夜間，嫩枝條與蓓蕾漸漸地潛來綴在以幹上了，無聲息地，瞬昧像天角的隱現的雲山——年青的活力的滋長永遠是一種神奇，一種秘密，與一種不可解的謎啊。</p>
<p>（在一片開廣得呌人舒暢的青空下面，我是曾聽到過某一枝小提琴的弓上流出來的II　Trovatore的明快的音節的。</p>
<p>我看到；小樹枝用了快跑的急切把嫩綠染上了；溪水像趕赴中午的鄉集的人羣，一簇簇地推擠著流過去，這中間，就連片刻的憇息都是給不許的；還有天上的薄雲，可也沒有「優閑」的神色呀；靜靜地飄過一方田野，一條曲水，於是便向著不可見的遠方隱沒了。</p>
<p>——忙碌的季節啊。</p>
<p>——不錯，在春天，就連南風都是認真的。</p>
<p>真的，就連最缺少勤快的白蝴蝶，也裝作忽忙地飛開去了。</p>
<p>——把那種明綠色的奮興記起來吧。</p>
<p>於是，我便把她放進意象的保管箱裹去了；記著明快的II　Trovatrore，也記著緊息在小溪邊的春天的小草。）</p>
<p>漸漸地，一顆真理的種子便給偷偷地移植進我底血液裹；一個早晨，一個夜晚，它跟著春天的草，同樣地，也帶著活力，在人的不經意中謎一般地滋長起來了。</p>
<p>年青的夥子，難道竟沒有膽量跟小草去學習，去比勝嗎？想；自家兒是早就應當有一種春草的意態了。</p>
<p>爲了憤怒，也爲了恥辱，終於，神往著春天的草，便咬著牙齒，自家兒來開始動手翻開那本作爲人世間之巨籍的「生活的傳奇」了。</p>
<p>我便勇敢地揭開了那頁可怕的赭色的書面，忍耐著一天天地讀它，思索它，吟味它，面對它……它是閃著幽緣色的火熖的呢。</p>
<p>優閑的心情便永遠地給摔開了，自家兒來打發去這一連串的艱苦的日子是駭怕的；於是，當生活的故事的進行中，即使稍稍起一點波折的話，臉也會給嚇青了——這時候的思緒是不會有詩的「煙土披里純」——生活並不是詩，而是披著胃甲的散文啊。</p>
<p>然而我是深深地記得春草之蓬勃的英姿的哪；於是便開始想到了；在自然的與社會的世界中，求生的滋味卻並不像它外面所代表的那樣的美麗；而相反地，卻是每分鐘都在付著煎熬的代價的呢。</p>
<p>難道滋長在三月的南風中的花草，真像你所「欣賞」到的那樣的嗎？看著那豐滿挺秀的長成的人，誰能想得到它們本身的努力的苦難呢？生活在這世界裹，單是「欣賞」是不夠的。</p>
<p>自然的世界（春天的風，溪邊不草吧？）不是給人「欣賞」；而是給人去「學習」的哪。</p>
<p>就那樣地，我一天天地把「欣賞」的閑情忘掉了——春天的小草一年年地長成了，繁滋了；對我，它是代表著一種絕大的求生的苦痛的。</p>
<p>（是應當記憶起南方的花草的時候了：小提琴上的明快的音節，笑是像溪中的小水一樣的啊。</p>
<p>——把那種明綠色的奮興記起來吧。）</p>

<p>我得抱歉，在生活中漂著來的，便連她底笑興II　Trovatore都忘了呢。</p>
<p>而現在，我又將攔著心看一次春天的小草了。</p>
<h3>鄉居散記</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>初次接觸到鄉村環境，使我興奮得忘了是到這裹來養病的。住處是朋友的家，二進三間的瓦屋，收拾得清窗凈幾，主人是朋友的一個七歲兒子和健談底他的老太太。當我帶了朋友的家書來扣門的時候，那個小孩子好像等候我好久似的牽了他祖母的手來開門，一點也不陌生地由他介紹了「這是我的奶奶」，那老太太笑著拍拍他底濃黑的頭髪，用著母性愛的口吻命令他：「呌伯伯呵！」就對我說，接到他爸信的時候，每天要幾次問我上海伯伯幾時來呢；聽見有人扣門，他總跑在黃媽前面來開門……實在鄉下太清靜，孩子沒有伴淘的，他常常吵要到上海去哩。</p>
<p>這是黃昏時候，我隨了他們祖孫走過一個院子，落日餘暈煕著花牆角，那是用方磚砌起來的，在牆沒上放著兩盆盛放的水仙，花牆內蔓延著的枯枝，似乎是海棠之類。過面是一排大缸，上面均覆著稻草，是出污泥而不污的荷花了。有一個深埋在地裹的，我走近一步，是我最喜歡的金魚呢。</p>
<p>老太太就解釋給我聽：「這些金魚的年齡比這孩子還大哩。是那年廟會，他爸爸—哈哈，他爸爸還沒有娶親，—買來有五十尾光景，現在二十尾都不滿了！」</p>
<p>「奶奶，什麼時候再有廟會，我去買那末許多來。」</p>
<p>孩子敝開了他的兩個小手掌作大圓形的姿勢，同時跳到缸邊用手指數著。</p>
<p>沿高牆邊，吊著一排粗麻繩，還有許多枯技附著，大概是牽牛花了。我想像著春夏之交，靜坐在這院子的窗前，焚香讀書，有出塵入世之感。</p>
<p>後面一進三間，兩旁是臥室，正中是普通的客堂，已經掌燈了，是一個古式的保險燈，在鄉下似乎很名貴的了。客堂正中是一幅名畫，因爲僅畫著兩塊雄援的山石，所以我作如此想。上面有橫額曰「曰善堂」。兩壁是書畫各四，紫檀口，八仙桌，太史椅均備。</p>
<p>黃媽奉上茶來。老太太說是他們家鄉的茶葉。飮之清香撲鼻，中國產茶的所在，倒底名不虛傳。</p>
<p>我羨慕我朋友坐在水秀山清的福地，更有慈愛的老母，伶俐的稚子，所說「福氣」他是可以當之無愧了。</p>
<p>移時，晚餐，除了一味鯽魚之外，餘皆是圖地裹的蔬菜。自已粗製的草菜，簡慢之至。</p>
<p>我謝了他們的殷勤待客，倒是幸福我此交生病了，不然，終年爲衣食奔走，那裹有這種清閑的起居呢！但是我的朋友卻也是在都市中討生活，呌我從那裹呢起呢？</p>
<p>我的臥室就在客堂的右側，臨窗對著院子的荷花缸，彷彿我喜歡那院子而主人特地爲我安排似的，室內也很雅潔，幾，榻，書架盡有，原來就是我朋友的書房。互相了晚安之後，我在煤油燈下寫了日記，讀了幾頁書，就寢時已聽見更鼓的聲音。</p>

<h3>五十歲以後幸運開始的男女演員（下）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>戲劇界的老皇后，柏屆里堪貝爾夫人（Ｍrs　palriek　campbell），是一般後進所最崇拜的。她在美國戲劇界，做了五十多年的領袖。她說；「如果我們老年人都告退了，觀衆們將向著誰笑呢？誰來扮飾老姑母呢？你知道喜劇中笑料的大部份，是我們供給的嗎？觀衆們喜歡取笑我們老年人，而我們就儘他們取笑。我們所覺得無上的快慰的，就是虛榮心的淡薄。羅們無庸隱藏我們的年齡。但是我們要隱藏，亦是隱藏不了的。我們同業之中，短不了有狹促鬼，看見了我們指點著道：「喂，你看，那堪貝爾夫人還活著哩。我小時候看見過她的。」我們老演員的地位，比年輕演員的還要穩固些，因爲導演們選擇我們的時候，就相信我們是適當的，不會使他失望的。我們爲什麼要退休呢。一個人身體健康的，儘管工作下去好。」</p>
<p>堪貝爾夫人第一次現身舞臺，還遠在一八八八年。她年輕時，艷名嗓甚是表演莎翁詩劇獨一女伶。她所到之處，各國君王倒履而迎。她年老之後，亦嘗一度退休，但她在退休期中，卻覺得無事可作，心神無主起來。她雖然尋著消遣，但總追念著過去的光榮，而想重來一下。有一天，愛爾溫泰爾堡和他的夫人，瑙瑪希拉在倫敦。他們徵求她的同意，要呌她在Ｒiptide一片中，擔任一個主要角色。她就欣然答應了。她自已亦想不到有人還要她。她說：「我從隱居之所跳出來之後，我不想再跳進去了。我現在的快樂，是我多年所沒有嘗過的。」</p>
<p>「大富之家」中扮演那位露德蔡太夫人的漢倫威斯利（Ｈelen　Wetiley）恐怕大家還記得她那種爐火純青的表演。她說；「我的生活的戲劇界分不開，已有四十年。我希望再有四十年繼續下去。我認爲老年是最有趣的一個時期。我們享愛各種的自由。我們亦不再受少年時情慾的牽制。我們有內省的能力，事理看得透澈。當然，有許多女人是到老受情感的牽制的。但是我相信那是少數。普通的女子，過了五十歲，在情感方面就成熟了。她有自知之明，她能分晰一切事理，一切周圍所接觸的人物。」</p>
<p>在一九一九年，紐約的戲劇恊會成立了。漢倫威斯利就是發啓人之一。她現在亦是其中的董事。紐約的戲劇恊會，就是她的孩子，時時在她的愛護鞠育之中。它要是沒有漢倫威斯利，就不能到現在的地步。漢倫威斯的利雖然有影戲合同，不能不住在好萊塢，但是她還常常到紐約，視察一切會務的進行。</p>
<p>蓋斯丹定動爵（Ｓir　Guy　Standidg）是好英塢演員中劇一無二的貴族了。他積聚了六十年的經騐，他說；「儘量享愛你的生命，但是不要作損人之事。能這樣，你儘管活著好了。」他又說：「不錯的，我是憢悻的。我一生沒有生過一天病。前幾天，我又發現了我從來不會疲倦的。我覺得莫名其妙起來。或者我的身體是特別構造的，或者有了什麼怪病，什麼腺的關係。」</p>
<p>蓋斯丹定的一生，是有聲有色的。他在九歲的時候，他的伯父給了他一個金鎊。他就將那金鎊，買了一條小船，他從家裹偷了一塊蓋臺布，作了船蓬，就和幾個人小膽大的小朋友，開始航海起來。到了十五歲，就開始演戲，但是受了欺騙，以致流落異鄉。後來他在一隻煤船上作事，又聞始度其航海生涯。他一度到了澳洲，開過金礦，牧過羊，但都不甚得意，并且念念不忘舞臺生活。後來他到了美國。他在無事可爲之時，靠著賣畫爲生，因爲他小時曾一度學過美術。後來他進了派拉蒙，得到極大的成功。不過歐唱不久發生了，他就奉召回國，參加戰事。他滿擬幾個月戰事告終，他重回派拉蒙工作。不想兵連過結，他在沙塲上過了五年地獄生活。結果他得到英皇的褒獎給了他動位。但是他回到美國的時候，差不多已經兩手空空了。</p>
<p>人家到了五十歲，是繼續工作。他到子十歲，是開始工作。他現在已經六秩大慶了。他的格主是「每天作一件兩件善事，尋一個兩個開心。每天早晨照著鏡子剃鬍子的時候，你應對你自已說；「今天又是一個好日子。感謝上帝使我能盡量亨樂。無論五十歲也好，六十歲也好，七十八十也好，一天有一天的用處。一天有一天的快樂。」（完）</p>
<h3>明星亦是一個Ｆan</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>在轉入本文之前，我想把這Ｆan字說明一下。Ｆan的意思就是，對於一種人或事物的崇拜者或是「迷」。比方Ｍovie　Fan就是電影「迷」</p>
<p>明星既然是個人，和他們會戀愛會結婚一樣的，他們各人都是一種Ｆan亦並不怎樣希奇的吧—現在讓我把各大明星所崇拜的對象寫在下面，以證明明星亦是一個Ｆan</p>
<p>約翰巴里摩亞在他一生中最敬愛最崇拜的就是那位有名的飛行家林白。強於自尊心的約翰，一看見林白就會忘了一切，拜倒在他之旁。有一次，他要想遇見林白起見，把他的汽車停在林白所住的飯店之門前，大約等了一小時左右，他才看見林白「慢慢呌」出來了。他就立刻從汽車中跳了出來，連忙和林白握手。於是他拿出攝影箱，正要柏林白之照的時候，可惜林白已經乘上汽車飛也似地過去了。</p>
<p>你想一想這種光影，一定恨林白不應以這種態度待他忠實的Ｆan吧！</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉是一個凱塞琳海嬪的Fan，但是我還從來沒有遇見過她。」</p>
<p>她關於凱琳曾這樣地説過：「像她那樣地，在今日的銀幕上，持有明顯之個性的女明星恐怕少有吧！她所拍的影片我完全都觀看過。有時候我把一樣的影片看兩三次的時候亦有。是的，我是她的非常熱心的Ｆan，但是我還從來没有遇見過她。」</p>
<p>小范朋克和克勞黛考爾白都是英國的劇作家，而以「戰國春秋」以及「藝海春光」的原作者聞名的諾愛爾克佛特之熱心的Ｆan。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥曾聲明她是平克勞斯貝的Ｆan。平所歌唱的留聲片，瓊差不多都有。並且每天唱著他的留聲片，簡直使近鄰的人之腦神經錯亂起來了。那好像一切都不怕的瓊，第一次遇到平的時候，她甚至像一位女學生似的，戰慄起來了。</p>
<p>最有趣味的就是金髪女郎格露利亞史鐵華所崇拜的偶像。她曾對衆人宣佈，她除了印度的甘地外，沒有可以敬愛的人了。</p>
<p>熱明星梅威斯脫是一個非常的愛國家。她說</p>
<p>「我專門擁護著羅斯福大總統呀！」</p>
<p>這樣地寫下去，將要沒有底止了，讓我就在這裹「收住」了吧！</p>
<h3>麗琳哈蕙今後的行止</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>自從脫離了福斯公司後，麗琳哈蕙今後的行止，曾有許多不同的猜測，有的說她將從此離開好萊塢了，可是都不是事實。</p>
<p>真的，當哈蕙脫離福斯的時候，本來就預備離開好萊塢的；所以她已於數星期前和英國國際公司訂了拍三部影片的合同，言明每部影片的代價是三萬美金。可是她總不甘心就這樣地離開好萊塢，她總想給好萊塢看看，一點自已好緣成績；而恰好哥倫比亞公司在部新片的Ｏncea　Gentleman中正需要一位主角就來請哈蕙去擔任了。</p>
<p>當麗琳看了該片的劇本是，充滿著動人的劇情。而她所要演的角色又需要唱二支歌和跳一點舞。所以她就答應了他們，並且訂了張合同。一星期後該片就開拍了。</p>
<p>而麗琳對於該片這樣感到滿足，所以當她將該片拍完後。預備再延遲數星期到英國去的行期，再拍一部她所認爲適合她自已，呌做「Ｌady　Beware」的新片。</p>
<p>大概拍完了該片後，她將到英國去，去履行她的新合同了。一同時她或者還要和她的未婚夫威廉弗立許（Ｗili·Frifsch）結婚吧？</p>
<p>無論如，合蕙遲早要成爲弗立許夫人的，她曾坦白坦對新聞記者告白遇，不過他們的婚禮是滯當她到了英國後立刻就舉行與否，到底還是個謎呢！</p>

<h3>民族呼聲（Ｂordertown）（三）</h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>黛兒聽了勃魯克的話，就問強尼道：「答應了」。勃魯克挿嘴道：「答應了！哼，一個流䛉律師的答應，算得了什麼？將來敲起來竹槓來，一世都緾不清了」。強尼不覺舉起拳來，照準了勃魯克的臉就打了過去。勃魯克經不起大勁，早已跌倒在地下。輧痓法庭理的法警，奔上前來將強尼拉開，勃魯克差不多快被他揑死了。大家抱住了強尼，但是他的火氣不久亦就消散了。</p>
<p>強尼拉米斯在法庭上行兇。審判官主張這樣的律師，應當停止他的律師職務。強尼於是就被停止職務了。停止職務！那就是律師的招牌，他的母親當了結婚戒指替他做的，摘了下來。那就是五年的辛苦，白白受了。那就是他永遠做不成林肯。他跑到神父那裹，神父勸他，應當注重靈魂上的平安，不要羨慕虛榮，不要懷抱野心。強尼拉米立斯的答覆是：「我知是神父，你的意思就是叫我回家去洗車子，或是掘陰溝，或是回到田間工作……」</p>
<p>他回到三間破爛房子的老有。前房放著一張捲䈴式的寫字枱，墻上掛著林肯的像，一幅美國國族—卻少了一塊招片。他的母親看見他回來，執著他的手悲泣起來。她喊著他的小名道：「璜尼托，你不要再出去了。這裹就是你的家。這裹就是你的家。這裹的人，都是你的同種同族，認識你而愛你的」。但是強尼卻說道：「他們雖然愛我，但卻不能給我我所要的東西——至於提到家，你看看——這叫什麼家呢」？他的母親詫異道：「你怎麼啦？這不是很好的家呢」？他的母親詫異道：「你怎麼啦？這不是很好的家嗎？我很喜歡的一。強尼道：「好吧，媽媽，你儘管喜歡。但是我不喜歡。你亦不能在這個地方久住。我要離開這個城池，到別處去賺些錢，兼些大錢。媽媽，你知道，在這個世界裹，祇要你有本事，你可以要什麼有什麼。這是我新近發現的。要是你窮了，低微了，你所能得到的，就是給人家踢屁股的，但是從今以後，我要踢人家的屁股了」。</p>
<p>這番話將拉米立斯老太太囑得不敢再響了。那天強尼拉米立斯就離開了落杉機，一直往南去了。一幌已是半年了。那天有幾個人坐在卻利路克的寫字間裹。卻利路克是銀鞋總會的主人。那個地方是美墨邊境沙漠無限中的一個邊城。銀鞋總會在城中大街上，帖了一塊很大的地盤。銀鞋總會是一個酒吧，亦是一個賭窟，亦是一個廉價的吃食店。每逢總拜六的晚上，十多個酒保，來往奔跑得滿頭是汗，侍候著一般粗魯無狀的酒客。賭錢器的扳機，和銀幣的聲音，丁當亂響著。賭臺上的侍者，在一片鬧聲之中，收錢付錢，忙得不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>在路克的寫字間裹，那裹還很靜默。路克很舒間地坐著，熱汗徐徐流了出來，因爲他是很肥胖的。四圍坐著的有五個人。祇聽見卻利路克氣喘喘地說道；「銀鞋值三萬五千的三倍還不止哩……並且，我並不想出賣呀」。五個人當中的一個說道；「你聽著，一個月之後，你想賣一萬塊錢，都沒有人要了。所以，你要是不賣的話，我們沒有法子，祇好將對面一塊地買它下來，另外開一爿酒店，要比你的像樣十倍。到了那時，你的銀鞋就成了一只破鞋了」。那人正說得起勁，一個人突然從外間走了進來，他說：「朋友們，我們東家說不賣」！那說話的人，正是強尼拉米立斯。他穿著整齊的藍嗶嘰衣服，雪白的機衫，橫領結，頭髪梳得光光的遄孔剃得白白的。他帶著笑容，昂然走到他們中間。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Anglo-French London Protocol and Germany</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to yesterday's European telegram, Germany has formally published its reply to the Anglo-French London Protocol. The agreements reached during the Anglo-French London talks involve the establishment of four conventions: (1) an air convention; (2) a disarmament convention; (3) a Central European convention; and (4) an Eastern European convention. Simultaneously, Germany is invited to rejoin the League of Nations. However, judging from Germany's current reply to the Anglo-French Protocol, while it agrees with the air convention, it still insists on equal treatment with France regarding the disarmament convention. As for the issues of the Central and Eastern European conventions and rejoining the League of Nations, it hardly mentions a word. This shows that while Germany has abandoned its ambition for territorial expansion in Western Europe, it still cannot completely forget about Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Germany abandoning its ambition for westward expansion is a very natural outcome. If Germany were to proceed in this direction, it would inevitably provoke joint action from Britain and France, with little chance of success. Therefore, on the eve of the Saar plebiscite, Hitler stated that if the Saar could return to Germany, there would be no further land disputes between Germany and France. His intention was not merely to appease France. Recently, as a result of the London talks, Britain and France have even proposed concluding an air convention. Once this becomes a reality, the defensive line of Western Europe against Germany since Locarno can be further solidified. The proposal for this convention originally arose from British suspicion of Germany and is also a further manifestation of Anglo-French coordination. Now that the other signatories of the Locarno Pact have successively agreed to this, if Germany refuses to accept, it would be tantamount to proving its ambition to attack British and French airspace. Conversely, if it can follow the crowd and echo the sentiment, it can not only alleviate British suspicion but also obtain the protection of the convention when it is attacked. Moreover, this action by Germany should win British satisfaction, thereby reducing the power of Anglo-French coordination, which is also within expectations. Therefore, Germany's current action is inevitably the result of weighing the pros and cons.</p>
<p>As for the development of Central and Eastern Europe, Germany seems unwilling to completely abandon it. Speculating on its intentions, it may either be planning to develop in these two regions at a suitable time, or it may not have genuine ambition in these two regions but merely wants to leave room for bargaining during negotiations. The so-called Central European issue centers on the non-interference in Austria's independence. Germany has previously made inquiries to Italy in this regard. The European telegram of the other day also stated that Germany believes Austria should decide for itself what kind of political system to adopt (or even adopt the National Socialist system). From this, it can be seen that Germany's attitude towards the annexation of Austria has not changed much in essence. Austrians are all rejoicing at the return of the Saar to Germany in this plebiscite. Even the Austrian National Newspaper, which has always opposed the National Socialist Party, said, "The Saar is the Saar of the Germans, and even the French cannot but recognize that it should be returned to Germany." It can be seen that although Germany and Austria are separated, the spirit of Pan-Germanism has always existed. If this spirit is not diminished, then even if the two countries cannot merge for the time being, there is ultimately a possibility of realizing the merger. Germany, being in this situation, cannot remain indifferent. As for Eastern Europe, judging from the recent continuous activities of the German National Socialist Party in Memel, it can be seen that its concern is profound. In addition, Slavic Poland is competing with Soviet Russia for the leadership of the Slavic people, and its ambition towards Russia has never ceased. Germany is delighted to have such a comrade and deeply feels that it is not alone. Therefore, its excuse for refusing to participate in the Eastern European Convention is, on the one hand, that Russia and Germany do not share borders, so there is no need to conclude this convention, and on the other hand, that the Eastern European Convention is a military alliance, and Germany does not want to participate. In fact, if Germany cooperates with Poland, it can invade Russia. As for the invasion of the Baltic countries, it has a base in East Prussia, which can give it even greater ease.</p>
<p>From our observation, Germany today may not immediately harbor extravagant hopes of developing in Central and Eastern Europe, but because the National Socialist Party's past propaganda has all touted the annexation of Austria, the recovery of lost territories, the expansion of territories, and the realization of Pan-Germanism, if it suddenly concludes a convention that violates this policy, it may arouse domestic criticism. Therefore, it specifically avoids talking about it, leaving it as a bargaining chip for future negotiations. In fact, if Germany does not participate in these conventions, France and Russia, France and Italy may have further integration, which may not be beneficial to Germany. Therefore, unless there is another purpose, there is no need to refuse to talk about it. However, the focus of the problem still lies with Britain and France. If Britain's gaze is purely focused on Western Europe, then the pace of Britain and France will naturally be difficult to synchronize. Furthermore, after France obtains British coordination, whether its reliance on Russia will remain the same as in the past is also a crucial factor. In short, how the intricate relationship between international countries will evolve will be glimpsed from the results of the upcoming Anglo-French talks.</p>

<h3>Hull Reaffirms U.S. Far East Policy: Good Neighborliness is the Center of Diplomacy, Policy Abides by Treaties, Cooperation Maintains Peace</h3>
<p>[New York] Secretary of State Hull stated in a speech to the Canadian Association here today that President Roosevelt's good neighbor policy is the center of the United States' relations with the Far East. Hull also said that the United States' problems in the Atlantic and Pacific are quite similar, that is, to seek political and economic stability through agreed-upon methods, and to cooperate in maintaining peace through methods such as non-aggression, mutual consultation, and disarmament. Hull stated that his statement to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on March 19, 1934, can summarize the United States' Far East policy. The importance of the United States' diplomatic position in the Pacific can be said to be between the immediate problems of the Western Hemisphere and the broad participation in the Western Atlantic. "Although the Pacific is vast, we also have territories and possessions, and a long history of relations. Although I do not have time to elaborate on the origins of our traditional Far East policy, such as the Open Door Policy, this policy has long been clearly defined by successive treaties, and these treaties have also stipulated methods for maintaining peace in the Far East and the Pacific. For example, the Washington Treaty has been very effective, and its basic principles are still deeply believed and adhered to by us." (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Foreign Policy Association President Opposes Expanding Armaments</h3>
<p>Criticizes Government's European Policy for Inability to Act Decisively</p>
<p>Challenging Japan Deemed to Have No Economic Benefits</p>
<p>President Boyer of the Manteford Foreign Policy Association stated in a speech today that he strongly criticized the government's foreign policy. Boyer said that President Roosevelt's support for unlimited expansion of naval and air plans can only be interpreted as a challenge to Japan, which has made the United States increasingly on the road to war, something unseen since 1917. Boyer said that President Luo's previous policy towards Latin America was quite successful, but the situation in the Far East is more complicated, resulting in failures everywhere. Now President Luo does not advocate the Kellogg-Briand Pact but instead tries to expand armaments, and in fact, there is no major economic benefit to be gained from fighting Japan, which should be strongly opposed by the people, because after the war, both sides will be injured, and there will be no victory or defeat. Boyer criticized the government's European policy for damaging relations with Europe, such as debt issues, monetary system issues, and international court issues, all of which could not be acted upon decisively, hindering the development of friendly relations. Negotiations with Russia have also failed, making the benefits of recognizing Russia all go to waste. Boyer believed that the only success of American foreign policy was the reciprocal treaties with Cuba and Haiti. Boyer also strongly urged Congress not to allocate more funds to expand armaments.

<h3>U.S. Exclusion of Japanese Immigrants, Japanese Ambassador Saito Submits Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Washington] The State Department announced today that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito had a long talk with Deputy Secretary Phillips to discuss the proposed land law in Arizona. Before the discussion, Saito pointed out to the Secretary of State that this law was detrimental to the friendly relations between Japan and the United States, which was regrettable. The State Department denied that Saito had lodged a formal protest but said that the land law proposed by the Arizona legislature was quite different from other existing or proposed equal laws, so the Japanese Ambassador was naturally unhappy. According to the Phoenix Observer, the capital of the state, Arizona State Senator Sullivan proposed a bill on February 6 to prohibit Japanese from leasing, living on, or cultivating any land in the state to produce food for human consumption. It is expected that the bill will pass the state House of Representatives. (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>

<p>[Rome] Although the negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia are quite difficult, people still hope to obtain satisfactory results. According to official sources, the three army battalions that recently departed for the Italian territories in East Africa are volunteer armies of the Fascist Party. The purpose of the departure of this army to East Africa is only to show that Italy will never ignore its due rights, in order to have its intended interests respected, and there is no other purpose.

<h3>Youth Enlist in Large Numbers</h3>
<p>[Rome] The army mobilized by the Italian government for the Italian-Ethiopian dispute will depart by ship from Messina to East Africa on February 24. Messina has now become a large camp. In recent days, trains have been carrying hundreds of young people to Syracuse and Palermo, where they will be given military uniforms and weapons. Today, another train full of young men conscripted into the army left for Syracuse, ordered to prepare for service in East Africa. Before departure, they were reviewed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Another large team of the Republic departed from Naples for Syracuse this afternoon, reviewed by the Italian Crown Prince before the departure. All the young people who were conscripted into the army received a postcard that read "By order of the King, you must report immediately to a certain regiment in a certain place to serve in East Africa." Those who received this card immediately abandoned their careers and went to the station within 48 hours without having to buy a ticket, boarded the train to the location of their regiment. In the eyes of the onlookers, these people were all young people on vacation. Secret police were stationed at the train station, monitoring the farewells of relatives and friends. Another train will continue to depart for Syracuse tonight. (Sixteenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mobilization Can Reach 100,000</h3>
<p>[Rome] The number of Italian troops that can be mobilized and sent to East Africa immediately is currently about 100,000, of which 30,000 are mobilized from the Florence area, and the remaining 70,000 are volunteer party armies of the Fascist Party, most of whom are under the age of 30 and have made a voluntary commitment to serve in the party army for ten years. They have not yet been enlisted. Two battalions of troops left from Rome yesterday, each battalion with 1,000 people. In addition, it was also heard that a unit of troops of about 1,000 people also departed from Naples a few days ago and have now reached the vicinity of Port Said in the northern Red Sea, but people generally believe that this army will go to Massawa in Italian Eritrea in Africa, rather than to Somaliland. It should be remembered that the Black Shirts Army participated in the recovery of the border of Sudan at Laez Anti, the pacification of West Silla, and the attack on the Senussi Sistas, and they made great achievements in the colonial war.

<h3>Supreme Council Ends</h3>
<p>[Rome] The winter session of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party ended today. Prime Minister Mussolini declared in the meeting that 70,000 party troops across the country have requested to be incorporated into the army and sent to East Africa. There are also thousands of soldiers who participated in the European War who have also requested the Ministry of the Army to depart. It can be seen that people of all ages can be loyal and brave to defend the country, which is commendable. The Prime Minister issued a statement on various diplomatic issues, the most important of which are: (1) The establishment of a new foundation for friendship between Italy and France; (2) What the government deems necessary to protect the indigenous security of the colonies is warmly supported by the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council also expressed its satisfaction that the mobilization of reserve soldiers in 1992 passed peacefully, and expressed its respect to the party troops who went to Africa. It also declared to the public that the government has taken various measures to enable the army to maintain and even expand its effectiveness. Subsequently, Fascist Party Secretary Starace made a report to the party, which was passed by the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council also stated that Prime Minister Mussolini made four important speeches from November 14, the twelfth year of the Fascist Party's reform (i.e., 1933), to November 11 of the thirteenth year, which expanded the concept of economic liberalism and created a country with a vocational group system. Since the implementation of the 40-hour work week system, hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers have found jobs, and the cooperation between employers and workers' groups and the government is commendable. Finally, the Supreme Council decided that every Saturday afternoon will be used for political and military training for young people. (Seventeenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] Fascist Party cadres have been holding night meetings at the Weishi Palace for three days. The issues discussed are divided into four categories: one is the agreement recently concluded by the government with various countries; two are the military measures to be taken; three are the implementation of the vocational combination system; and four are social issues. Regarding the first item, the cadres approved the agreements signed by the government with France, England, and Egypt. These agreements demarcate the Italian African borders between West Silla and Sudan, and allow Italy to obtain 114,000 kilometers of land south of Libya. The agreement signed by French Foreign Minister Laval in Rome, which "places Italian-French relations on a new foundation of friendship," was also approved by the cadres. Military measures are particularly important. When the European situation is not without danger, and there are warnings in Africa, the issue of armaments must be paid attention to. The cadres issued a communique stating that various measures have been taken to prevent emergencies, and that the manufacture of armaments has not only maintained its original state but has also expanded its scope. Regarding domestic affairs, the cadres agreed to implement the vocational combination system, so that Italy can fundamentally implement an organized economic system that is completely different from the free economic system. Finally, the cadres decided to adopt a 40-hour work week system, which will be implemented uniformly throughout Italy. During the recent six-month trial period, 210,000 unemployed people have gained work. From this, it can be seen that the discussion of the highest organ of the Fascist Party is of great importance, because all Italian domestic and foreign policy issues are approved by this organ, and its outline is also determined by the cadres.

<h3>Making Use of Weekend Leisure, All Italian Men Receive Military Training</h3>

<h3>To Cope with Berlin's Reply, Britain and France Reopen Talks</h3>
<p>After Exchanging Views, a Note is Sent to Germany</p>
<p>Britain and Germany Will First Hold Informal Talks</p>
<p>[Paris] It is heard that the French government has no objection to the German government's reply proposing that Britain and Germany exchange views first, but only after (1) Britain and France exchange views, (2) Britain and France jointly send a note to Germany, and (3) Germany replies to this note. There is deep concern here that the negotiations will be chaotic, so it is advocated that the order of communication should be determined first. French newspapers still say that Germany's attitude is deliberately setting traps. However, the French political circles are not as pessimistic as the newspapers. (Seventeenth Reuters Telegram) [Paris] It is generally believed that the Anglo-French talks will be reopened on Monday by the diplomatic representatives of the two countries, but only after the French Council of State on Tuesday and the British Cabinet meeting on Wednesday can there be positive progress. The general opinion is that the proposal for informal talks held in the Anglo-French talks will only be held by Britain and Germany. Today's "Times" commented that negotiations can only continue if Germany's reply has a solid conclusion. The door to beneficial talks is not yet closed, but it must rely on the governments of Britain, France, and Italy to hold a firm and affirmative attitude, so that the talks can turn in a smooth direction.

<h3>Famous German Reporter Writes Article Demanding Equality in Armaments</h3>
<p>Air Convention Should Not Be Mixed with Other Conventions</p>
<p>Germany Never Forgets About Memel</p>
<p>[Berlin] Scheffer, a famous reporter for the National Socialist Party, wrote in the Berlin Daily that "People generally believe that the Air Convention must be signed at the same time as other conventions. This is actually close to superstition, because various conventions other than the Air Convention are like gathering sand into a tower. If you want to reach the height of your original dream, it will take countless years to do so. The most important thing now is to recognize equality in armaments rights. Equality in armaments rights should not be mixed with other convention plans, nor should there be any reservations." (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)</p>

The arbitrary and illegal system adopted by the Lithuanian government in the Memel region should be eliminated first. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Different Views on German Reply from Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Paris] Central European countries have different views on Germany's reply to Britain and France regarding the London Declaration of February 3. Newspapers in the capital of Yugoslavia believe that Germany's sole purpose is to delay and break the unity of Western European countries and to cause a rift between Britain and France. Government newspapers in Warsaw said that the German reply was quite approved by London, while opposition newspapers said that the reply has caused a bad impression. Vienna's interpretation of the German reply is that it is Germany's refusal to recognize Austrianism and independence, and that all Austrians must unite to save Austria from falling into Hitlerism, and there is no other way.

<h3>Interpretations of German Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the shocking criticisms from Parisian newspapers concerning Germany's response to the Anglo-French declaration, the Deutsche Tageszeitung here commented that this state of Parisian nervousness would eventually subside, and a fair assessment of our views would emerge. The German response clearly indicates Germany's agreement to prevent an arms race. Germany's particular emphasis on an air convention stems from the fact that the Anglo-French declaration leaned in that direction. Germany also does not wish to estrange Anglo-French relations. We sincerely hope that England and France can cooperate to lead European peace. However, Germany, as an independent nation, could not initially engage in separate negotiations with England. As for Germany's attitude toward the League of Nations, the newspaper believes it is already very clear and need not be reiterated. Germany's primary requirement is the recognition of its equal rights by all nations before there can be any possibility of discussing a return to the League of Nations. (16th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Bucharest, Romania - Direct telegraph communications between Romania and Russia, which were interrupted after the Soviet Russian revolutionary government signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany and Austria in 1918, have not been restored for seventeen years. Recently, Romania and the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations. Direct telegraph communications between the two countries officially resumed today. The Romanian Minister of Transportation, Mr. Vlana Savitch, and the Soviet People's Commissar of Transportation, Mr. Antropov, exchanged telegrams to celebrate. As for direct train service between Romania and the Soviet Union, it will likely have to wait until the reconstruction of the bridge over the Dniester River on the border between the two countries is completed in August of this year before railway traffic can be officially restored.

<h3>Roosevelt Proposes Two-Year Extension of the Recovery Act</h3>
<p>To Address Congress Today</p>
<p>[Washington] In his message to Congress tomorrow, President Roosevelt will include a new national recovery bill, proposing to extend the effective period of the existing Recovery Act by twelve months and granting the authority to extend it for another two years if necessary. It is reported that President Roosevelt has decided to seek permanent legislation for some of the main principles of the existing emergency act, which will expire in June of this year. These principles include the abolition of child labor, the right of workers to collective bargaining, and the maintenance of minimum wages. Given that the Senate Judiciary Committee is currently holding hearings to investigate accusations against monopolies established under the current National Industrial Recovery Act and has made recommendations calling for a separate investigation by the Senate Finance Committee, if the new bill is introduced to Congress, although it may receive majority support from the Democratic Party, it is feared that it will spark fierce debate.

<h3>Japan Actively Plans Agricultural and Industrial Immigration to the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Peers General Budget Committee had considerable discussion on immigration to Manchuria on the 16th. The current Manchurian immigrants, the so-called armed immigrants, were actively guided and encouraged by the Colonial Affairs Ministry and implemented in cooperation with the military two years ago. Since the first immigrants, subsidies of 500,000 yuan per year have been provided. Since Colonial Affairs Minister Kodama took office and reformed the organizations stationed in Manchuria, the policy towards Manchuria has become more organized, and the focus has been on the immigration project. In addition to the armed immigrants, it has been decided to send agricultural and industrial group immigrants from next year in order to engage in planned development. Since last year, Administrative Official Imayoshi, stationed in Changchun, consulted with the Kwantung Army, brought his plan back to Tokyo, and studied the specific plan with the military. The initial plan was to establish an immigration company with a capital of 50 million yuan. This is a tentative plan. A joint Japanese-Manchu government-business agricultural and industrial immigration company will be established as a foundation to promote the specific plan. Once it is largely completed, the Colonial Affairs Ministry and the Army Ministry will conduct consultations. However, this plan is quite large, and the decided plan may be submitted to the next session of parliament at the end of the year. (17th Nichiren Telegram)</p>
<h3>Chinese Eastern Railway to be Managed by the South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>The Puppet Government to Issue Public Bonds in Japan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The management policy of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) after the completion of the transfer has been internally determined by the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs. The outline is as follows: (1) Entrust management to the SMR; (2) The SMR will use the net profit from the CER operation to repay the "Manchukuo" national debt. If the repayment of interest is insufficient, the SMR will lend the shortfall; (3) The CER freight rate will be lowered to the same amount as the national railway; (4) The SMR will use 50 million yuan as emergency funds to repair the CER tracks and vehicles; (5) The current employees of the CER will be dismissed and re-employed in its entirely. (17th DenTsushin Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the financial method for purchasing the CER, the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs is currently coordinating with the "Manchukuo" side and the Kwantung Army side, and is conducting careful research. The decision is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The funds for purchasing the CER, totaling 170 million yuan, will be covered by "Manchukuo" public bonds, which will be issued in the Japanese domestic financial market. It has been decided that a banking group will underwrite all of these public bonds; (2) The full amount of these public bonds will not be issued for the time being. Only the portions required for cash and in-kind compensation and the retirement payments for personnel will be issued separately; (3) The CER entire line will be used as collateral for these public bonds, and a flexible mortgage system will be adopted; (4) The 30 million to 40 million yuan urgently needed after the CER sale is completed will be raised by the SMR in the form of a loan from "Manchukuo" to the SMR; (5) For other necessary financing for the CER, it has been decided that the banking group will make appropriate arrangements. If market conditions change and the financing becomes impossible to negotiate, the Ministry of Finance Deposit Bureau will underwrite the public bonds and provide other overall assistance, which has also been agreed upon.</p>

<h3>Hauptmann, Lindbergh Kidnapping Case Defendant, Escorted to Death Row</h3>
<p>Cell Located Six Steps from the Electric Chair</p>
<p>Flemington - Bruno Hauptmann, the defendant in the Lindbergh kidnapping case, was escorted to the death chamber at Trenton State Prison today, handcuffed to two police officers and guarded by armed soldiers, in a motorcade consisting of four automobiles. Upon reaching the courthouse steps, Hauptmann paused and told a news reporter, "I am innocent." He then laughed loudly and said, "They watch me now." (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Flemington - When Bruno Hauptmann was escorted to Trenton State Prison last night, a number of prisoners, upon seeing Hauptmann enter the death chamber, shouted at him. The other 600 inmates in the prison joined in, and the shouting was deafening, almost turning into a riot. The prison guards used all their strength to restore order. Three prisoners were driven into the "hole" for disobeying orders. Hauptmann was prisoner number 17,400 last night. About 700 people gathered outside the prison wanting to see Hauptmann's face. The car escorting Hauptmann drove through the crowd and into the prison. Hauptmann's cell is only six steps away from the electric chair, and it is illuminated by strong electric lights day and night, which will continue until the execution is carried out.

<h3>The Various Aspects of the Japanese Regular Session</h3>
<p>Parliamentary Politics Devoid of Vitality</p>
<p>Okada Cabinet Greatly Loses Popular Support</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, parliamentary politics in Japan have existed in name only, with a strong tendency to revert to the old system of clan rule. However, with Japanese capital fully developed, even the military, despite their soaring ambitions, cannot but accept the norms of modern political organization. Therefore, the authority of the military is still subject to certain limitations and is not likely to overstep its bounds for the time being. Because the military strongly advocates for a state of emergency, asserting that the "national crisis" is imminent and that "national unity" should be implemented, the application of political parties in constitutional politics has completely lost its function, allowing the military to act unilaterally. Since the Meiji Restoration, democratic movements in Japan have gradually emerged and manifested in actual activities. The beginning of this trend was when Takashi Hara, a commoner (without a peerage), was appointed as Prime Minister. At that time, World War I had just ended, and an atmosphere of peace permeated the world. The military's ambitions for expansion also had to be somewhat restrained. Their concession to constitutional politics was almost inevitable due to the circumstances.</p>
<p>Recently, the international arms race has become an open secret, and "economic alliances" are the state policy of major countries. The Japanese military is taking advantage of this trend. Having established great achievements externally, they are still not satisfied internally. Therefore, they plan to use the rhetoric of the international crisis of 1935 and 1936 to mobilize the people, using the power of the people to overwhelm parliament. However, elder statesmen such as Prince Kinmochi Saionji, Nobuaki Makino, and also Korekiyo Takahashi, Reijirō Wakatsuki, and Kisaburō Suzuki are all strongly supporting constitutional politics and at least maintaining the status quo. Saionji, the sole surviving elder statesman since the Meiji Restoration, is mediating between the young military officers, the elder statesmen, and the political parties, allowing a senior naval officer to govern the country, hoping that the country will be able to support constitutional government and enter a normal state in the future. Unexpectedly, the stains of political parties have become more extensive, and party infighting is inevitable. The credibility of political parties has been swept away as a result. The military is therefore rising, the state of emergency is becoming increasingly urgent, and parliamentary politics have become mere decorations.</p>
<p>During the 66th Extraordinary Session of parliament last year, general public opinion secretly supported parliament and opposed the military. The largest political party had a possibility of taking over the Okada Cabinet, and the alliance between the Seiyūkai and the Minseitō further indicated that the large financial groups were united in their efforts to restrict the development of the military. However, the strength of the political parties was insufficient, and the united front was unstable. Maintaining the normal state of parliament was not a problem. However, restoring the power of political parties was not allowed by reality. The Seiyūkai, as the largest party, was unable to form a cabinet or even control parliament. At first, they thought that they were influenced by public opinion and restricted by the military, so they did not dare to seize political power lightly. At the beginning of the Extraordinary Session of parliament, public opinion gradually showed goodwill towards political parties. Since the Seiyūkai had close ties with rural areas, they decided to curry favor with rural areas on one hand and probe the public sentiment on the other. The "bomb proposal" of Mr. Tōbu - a proposal to increase the budget by 180 million yuan - arose from this. After learning that the Okada Cabinet had brought Korekiyo Takahashi into the cabinet as Minister of Finance, transforming the second-rate cabinet into a first-rate cabinet, the Seiyūkai, if it insisted on its proposal, would inevitably be dissolved and fail.</p>
<p>After the opening of the 67th Session of parliament, there were still no major highlights. The hidden reef of the "bomb proposal" still existed. The Seiyūkai, which occupied 261 seats in parliament, was still in opposition to the Okada Cabinet, standing at the crossroads of overthrowing the cabinet and dissolving parliament. Neither side had the determination to fight to the death, nor were they willing to engage in desperate political struggles. The current cabinet is nominally a cabinet of national unity in a state of emergency, but it does not actually involve political parties in political operations. After parliament is dissolved, the Seiyūkai, currently in an anti-government position, will not be able to form a cabinet in the future. They have no idea how to campaign again after being dissolved or how to apply political tactics. They are in a dilemma. As a result, they have no choice but to reluctantly seek a compromise solution.</p>
<p>The Okada Cabinet submitted a supplementary budget of 15 million yuan as a subsidy to alleviate the poverty of rural areas, using this to appease the Seiyūkai, also indicating the government's attitude of compromise. The hardliners in the Seiyūkai did not find this satisfactory, while the moderates believed that this could be used to end the situation in order to avoid unexpected changes in the future. At the same time, they used the incident of Soji Tokonami (the current Minister of Communications) receiving 500,000 yuan from the highest authorities in China during his visit to the Northeast in 1928 as an excuse to attack the government, which may have led to the Okada Cabinet compromising to the political parties. However, Okada was not originally from a political party, while Tokonami had deep ties with political parties. As this matter unfolds and concludes, the Okada Cabinet will lose popular support, and the political parties will suffer even more, ultimately leading to the military gaining power and parliamentary politics further declining.

<h3>Yu Xuezhong and Iga Discuss War Zone Issues</h3>
<p>New Security Forces Enter War Zone</p>
<p>Japanese Side Only Permits 5,000</p>
<p>Beijing Communication: As of today (16th), a resolution path regarding the "war zone" issue has indeed been agreed upon by both parties. The entry of newly formed security forces into the "war zone," a key point of discussion, will be the first to be realized. While there were initial reports of 9,000 personnel and the types of weapons they would carry, as of yesterday morning (15th), following discussions between Iga Seiya, a representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, at the Ping Office of the 51st Army on Xinshi Hutong, the number remains at 5,000. In addition to rifles, they may carry 50 light machine guns. It is reported that after agreeing on the number of personnel and weapons, Iga stated that the Japanese side would be able to inspect the number of light machine guns at any time. Yu responded that frequent inspections seemed cumbersome and created many inconveniences. He proposed that a joint Chinese-Japanese inspection be conducted once the new security forces entered the "war zone," which would be simpler and more convenient. Iga then expressed his acceptance. Yu then stated that the purpose of the security forces carrying light machine guns into the "war zone" was to maintain public order and suppress banditry, and that there was absolutely no intention of demonstrating anything against Japan. The Japanese side should sympathize with this. Iga then stated that in the event of a major bandit outbreak in the "war zone" in the future, if it was deemed necessary, the Chinese side could transport artillery for use after obtaining the consent of the Japanese side. However, it was stated in advance that the artillery must be transported back after use. The meeting then concluded. Iga left Beijing at 1:15 PM that afternoon for Tianjin, and then traveled to Changchun to report back to Minami Jiro, the Commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army. According to Yu Xuezhong's statement to reporters that day, the departure date of the new security forces has not yet been scheduled due to the need for various preparations. These 5,000 personnel will be organized into two brigades, and the provincial government appointed Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu as brigade commanders when the troops were formed some time ago. It is planned that Zhang Yantian's troops will be stationed in the Luanyu area, and Zhang Qingyu's troops will be stationed in the Jimmi area. The location and number of troops stationed will depend on local conditions. For example, if a certain area has no bandit activity, there is no need to station troops there. Conversely, if a certain area has unrest, the number of troops stationed may be increased to meet the needs. The new security forces were originally composed of 9,000 personnel. Now that only 5,000 are needed, the remaining 4,000 will be returned to their original units or dismissed with compensation. (16th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Actions in Xiamen</h3>
<p>Baimu's Southern Tour Carries Major Mission</p>
<p>Japanese and Taiwanese Resemble Another Organization</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Japanese Third Fleet, dispatched overseas, led by Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Gengo Baimu, arrived in Xiamen on the 6th with nine warships and departed for Guangdong on the 9th. After Baimu left Xiamen, Rear Admiral Masasuke Shimomura, commander of the 5th Torpedo Squadron, remained in Xiamen aboard the cruiser "Tatsuta". Shimomura has been in close contact with various circles in recent days. According to sources familiar with the Japanese situation, Baimu's southern tour carries an extremely important mission, far beyond ordinary cruises and social calls. Upon his arrival in Xiamen, he visited political and business circles, expressing his views on Sino-Japanese issues. He also stated that the January 28th Incident was a misunderstanding and that, in light of the current international situation, China and Japan should be friendly and cooperate to jointly work together against external threats to maintain peace in East Asia. However, he did not mention a single word about the issue of the four northeastern provinces. Shimomura is scheduled to return to Magong on the "Tatsuta" on the 17th (tomorrow). It is heard that more famous warships will continue to arrive, carrying four military officers from the Japanese Ministry of the Navy, who will be stationed permanently in Xiamen as military advisors. At the same time, many positions in the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen, including the vice-consul, will be filled by personnel from the Ministry of the Navy. This alone is enough to reveal the Japanese ambitions.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese convened a conference across the strait in Taiwan last year, they have been encouraging Taiwanese to move to China. As a result, the number of Taiwanese coming to Xiamen has been increasing daily, gradually advancing inland. The Japanese are also encouraging Taiwanese capital to be invested in Fujian, with large quantities of Japanese goods flooding the Fujian province and economic progress proceeding extremely rapidly. On the one hand, they are trying their best to win over Chinese people from all walks of life and pay attention to the civilian armies. However, even though the civilian armies are unruly, they rarely willingly betray their country. Most of them have now been incorporated into the provincial and central government forces, and the Japanese plan has failed.</p>
<p>The situation in Xiamen is unique, with a very large number of Japanese Taiwanese, wielding considerable influence, prevalent in all levels of society. Relying on the power of the Japanese, they often act willfully outside of China's rule of law, causing disputes that are reported endlessly. They have also formed their own organization, unified under the Taiwan Public Association, governed by the Japanese Consulate, and supported by the Japanese Police Department. The Japanese Police Department is, in fact, like a public security bureau, and the Taiwan Public Association is virtually the Xiamen Municipal Council for Taiwanese people. The Japanese also conduct their own census of Taiwanese residents, with census address plates compiled by the Taiwan Public Association seen everywhere. Streets and alleys are divided into districts, with the signs of their district protection committees prominently displayed. Furthermore, the Japanese Taiwanese, taking advantage of their power, enjoy preferential treatment in everything. They can avoid taxes and donations, monopolize the business of opium and gambling, and display their arrogance at all levels. As a result, a small number of unscrupulous and ignorant Chinese people, filled with envy, also hope to obtain Japanese nationality. The Japanese also use these people to win over people from all walks of life. However, enlightened and outstanding people rarely enter their fold. Moreover, the Japanese in Xiamen do not outwardly pursue an aggressive approach. Therefore, they often encounter Taiwanese disputes in recent years, and the Japanese consuls have not adopted an overbearing attitude, but rather strive for peaceful solutions. This is because they do not want to offend the British and therefore reluctantly maintain calm. (February 16th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiajua's Speech on Transportation</h3>
<p>(C) Maritime Administration</p>
<p>Among the administrative tasks of the Ministry of Communications, maritime administration is the most difficult to handle, because maritime rights are constrained by treaties and often meet resistance. For example, restricting foreign pilots, due to various complex circumstances, has not been resolved. Furthermore, there is a lack of funding. Various revenues are barely sufficient to maintain the daily expenses of the maritime administration bureaus, let alone develop enterprises. In the near future, the only option is to establish a good foundation in the coastal and inland river areas, and then plan for ocean development. The various resolutions of the National Maritime Administration Conference and the Promotion and Discussion Meeting held in May last year have gradually been implemented based on their urgency. The following are the more important matters that were carried out in the twenty-third year of the Republic: (1) Refreshing general maritime administration. Since the reform of the maritime administration's subordinate institutions the year before last, all local ship registration offices have been abolished, and offices have been established in important ports under the Shanghai, Wuhan, and Tianjin Maritime Administration Bureaus. Moreover, since the Guangzhou Maritime Administration Bureau has not yet been established, two directly subordinate Xiamen and Fuzhou Maritime Administration Offices have been specially established. Furthermore, the boundaries of rivers connecting to the sea have been clearly defined to avoid conflicts with the management authority of local governments, and progress has been very smooth. In addition, due to the lack of maritime talent in our country, after the Ministry managed to restore the Wusong Merchant Marine College in the eighteenth year of the Republic, the number of graduates is still small. From the last semester, the number of students has just increased to more than 300. In the second half of the year, efforts should be made to expand it further and increase equipment. As for the current serving crew members, since June of the twenty-second year of the Republic, four regular examinations have been held, and a total of more than 1,100 people have passed the regular and temporary certifications. Other tasks such as finding ways to inspect foreign ships, banning machine-propelled boats, improving ship management, and publishing measures to protect passenger safety, and establishing maritime arbitration bodies, etc., are all tasks that were fully committed to last year and should also be completed this year. (2) Supervising and promoting private shipping. In order to reduce the excessive competition among shipping companies and to unite them to increase economic efficiency, the Ministry organized the Shipping Cooperation Design Committee last year, conducted detailed surveys and statistics, and designed carefully. It also ordered each maritime administration bureau to maintain the status quo for any routes before the shipping cooperation plan is announced, and not to add ships unless there are special circumstances. Now the preparatory office of the China Shipping Cooperative Society has been established, and the implementation of the cooperative plan has begun. This year, it should be urged to be completed. (3) Planning and organizing the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was taken over by the state, it has been working hard to reorganize, adding sea-going ships and attracting many passengers and cargo. After deducting all expenses, insurance, depreciation, and installment repayments, the four-masted ships have an average monthly net profit of about 30,000 yuan. At the same time, water and land transportation is being organized, so that the company's North and South Ocean routes and the Yangtze River route can be connected with various railways. The Longhai Railway is important, and the Haizhou branch was expanded last year to handle joint transportation matters. As a result, the company's operating income has increased significantly. Furthermore, the company's pier locations are excellent and the storage capacity of the warehouses is large. In recent years, warehouses have been added in Guangzhou, and the buildings of the Hankou, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Tianjin branches have been renovated, and the docks in Shantou, Zhenjiang, Wenzhou, Changsha, and other places have been repaired. As a result, there are gradually more passengers and cargo. The Jinliyuan, Yangjiadu, Central, and North Warehouses are also planned to be rebuilt, and construction can begin when the funds are available. Moreover, the land along the Pujiang beach where the Jinliyuan and other warehouses are located has been repeatedly proposed for rent increase and application for land ownership over the years, but the matter could not be resolved. It was only settled last autumn. As a result, the company's assets increased by more than 7.5 million yuan. Furthermore, each branch has changed to a real-time reporting and sales system to ensure strict management. Since then, income has been more abundant. The system of comprador employed on each ship has also been reformed and replaced with a purser system, directly managed by the company. A pilot program has been implemented and is now gradually being promoted to each ship. The company used to have a 95% commission system to encourage attracting customers, but this year it has been abolished to prevent loopholes. In addition, efforts such as prohibiting private chartering and paying attention to the cleanliness and hygiene of each ship are being reorganized at any time to facilitate passengers and cargo. Therefore, the business volume in the twenty-second year of the Republic increased by 25% compared to the average of the four years from the eighteenth to the twenty-first year of the Republic. The statistics for the second half of the twenty-third year of the Republic are not yet complete, but the business volume in the first half of the year increased by 31% compared to the average of the same period from the eighteenth to the twenty-first year of the Republic. However, the accumulated deficits over the years are too large, and the annual interest requires 2 million to 3 million yuan. Although the operating surplus last year was 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, it is not enough to offset the debt. Therefore, reorganizing the debt is an urgent task at present. Now the Ministry's telecommunications debt has been completely resolved, and the reorganization of the company's debt is also being planned and expedited. The company has been ordered to notify the creditors to negotiate the handling of the matter and strive to complete it within this year. Moreover, recently there have been requests from various parties to open ocean routes. Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-owned enterprise, it is obliged to do so. However, it is still unable to meet the demand for coastal and Yangtze River services, so it can only be postponed for the time being. This year, the Ministry plans to add 70,000 tons of river and sea vessels, divided into 24 ships, to operate on the coast and the Yangtze River. Negotiations began separately in the autumn of last year, and everything is progressing quite smoothly. If progress continues smoothly, a large portion of them should join various routes this year.</p>
<p>(D) Civil Aviation</p>
<p>Civil aviation is particularly important in our country, where transportation is inconvenient. However, it is impossible to develop it solely relying on postal allocations without other funding subsidies. The internal organizations of both China and Eurasia Airlines are now sound. However, pilots who do not have more than 1,000 hours of flight record cannot pass the qualification, so there is a great shortage of talent. Special training is now being added, and there should be an increase in a batch of good domestic pilots this year. (1) The current routes of China Airlines are Shanghai-Sichuan, Shanghai-Beijing, and Shanghai-Guangdong, among which the Shanghai-Sichuan route has the most developed business, reaching Chengdu. It is now preparing for the Chengdu-Batang route, and then promoting it to Lhasa, in order to complete the transportation of Kangzang. The Shanghai-Beijing route can be replaced with new aircraft in the summer, increasing the number of flights and changing to daily flights. The Qingwei route (Qingdao via Yantai to Weihaiwei) will also be opened. Due to coastal climate relations on the Shanghai-Guangdong route, the initial opening last year was not smooth. Efforts are now being made to improve it and officially resume flights, and the number of flights will also be increased in the second half of the year. (Daily express flights will be opened directly from Shanghai to Hankou. Special flights will be opened at various stations along the way. The Shanghai-Beijing and Shanghai-Guangdong routes may also be handled in this way in the second half of the year.) The Guangzhou-Hanoi route is also being reviewed. The Chongqing-Kunming route has been successfully test-flown. The company's income and expenditure in the past year, after deducting depreciation, can still be balanced, and there will be a surplus this year. This seems to be unique among airlines in various countries. The passenger fare was reduced by 20% last year, and it is planned to reduce it by 20% further from the afternoon. New docks have been ordered for each route and can be replaced in May. (2) Eurasia Airlines has had many difficulties in the past. The original plan to fly directly to Berlin has not been achieved to this day. The Shanghai-Xinjiang route was opened the year before last, reaching Dihua and Tacheng. However, due to internal relations in Xinjiang Province, the planes can only reach Lanzhou. In April this year, it should be possible to restore the route to Hami first. The Ping-Yue route (Beijing to Guangzhou), Lan-Ning route (Lanzhou to Ningxia), and Ning-Bao route opened last year. The number of flights on the Ningxia-Baotou route can be increased in the second half of the year. Now there are more plans for two routes, Xi'an to Chengdu and Guangzhou to Kunming, to develop transportation in the northwest and southwest. The Kunming direct flight to Yangon route is also being reviewed. However, air passenger tickets and freight rates are still expensive and too far from China's economic situation. Therefore, the company has reduced passenger and freight rates by a quarter from last month.</p>
<p>(E) Accounting System</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications manages state-owned enterprises such as postal, telecommunications, navigation, and civil aviation. Accounting naturally occupies an important position. At the beginning of my tenure, I paid special attention to this and hired Chinese and foreign accountants for each important subsidiary agency to conduct regular audits and permanently stationed auditors, and set up auditors to go to various places for verification and assistance at any time. At that time, there was a proposal to establish an accounting director's office, so I tried my best to promote its realization. Under the guidance of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics in recent years, accounting has been having an independent spirit. (1) Ordinary official accounting. The accounting books and forms used by the Ministry of Communications are all handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the National Government for the unified accounting system of official agencies. All income and expenditure items are transferred through the National Treasury in accordance with the unified treasury income and expenditure management methods. Since its implementation, the accounts have been recorded at any time, and reports have been compiled and sent on schedule. The degree of all income and expenditure can be said to be on track. If reports are not prepared and sent on schedule, funding will be suspended immediately, and the effect of accounting control has been achieved. (2) Business accounting. Postal accounting can still be handled in accordance with the principles of business accounting. Telecommunications accounting has always been used in an official manner. As long as the report can be verified, the responsibility is considered completed. There is no such thing as business accounting. Navigation accounting, although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been operating for decades, the accounting system has always been incomplete. With the reorganization in recent years, great attention has been paid to accounting, and progress has been made. As for the accounting situation of China and Eurasia Airlines, there has been much progress. Based on the above situation, the reform of telecommunications and navigation accounting is more urgent than postal accounting, and the scope of telecommunications is vast and even more burdensome. Therefore, the reorganization has been carried out first. Previous authorities have already paid attention to this. In the nineteenth year of the Republic, telecommunications accounting regulations were promulgated, but most of them were not implemented. Therefore, a telecommunications accounting revision committee was specially organized the year before last to formulate various rules and regulations, compile various examples, and issue guidelines for implementation to various agencies for compliance. This system has been approved by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and has been piloted in the second half of last year. The Ministry of Communications has also sent personnel to various places to provide practical guidance. Now all telecommunications agencies have followed the new system, and it is expected that the nationwide telecommunications balance sheet will be compiled soon. A telecommunications accounting research committee has been organized at the same time. In order to promote the independent spirit of accounting, it is believed that accounting personnel should not advance or retreat with the主管 officer. An accounting personnel examination was held in the first half of last year and assigned to various subsidiary agencies. In general, since the Ministry of Communications and its subordinate government agencies and telecommunications accounting have been operating in accordance with the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics' laws and regulations, the time is short, but considerable results have been achieved. This year, it is planned to further establish a budget system in navigation and postal affairs, determine its accounting system, and make it completely independent, and directly command by the Ministry of Communications. It is also planned to compile transportation accounting books for reference. Other matters such as the training of accounting personnel and the accounting personnel examination are of great importance to the promotion of the system, and it is planned to proceed gradually according to the actual needs.</p>
<p>I have followed the instructions of the central government and received the help of all colleagues inside and outside the Ministry. Although the results of the things I have done are still far from ideal, the transportation industry has been riddled with holes for a long time. However, under the current economic situation in our country, there is no other way but to rely solely on the income of the business itself to improve and develop it. Therefore, it is not easy to complete large-scale plans in a short period of time for all businesses. However, due to the importance of the transportation industry and the immaturity of our country's transportation industry, there is a need to catch up quickly to seek development. We can only find ideas in the absence of ideas and do it step by step. What I said above is the minimum that is in progress this year and can be completed one by one. If progress is smooth, the degree of progress can be increased. Various businesses have already turned the corner, and the future is very promising. As for paying special attention to places where transportation is inconvenient, we should continue to carry out our past aspirations consistently. However, the scope of the transportation industry is vast, and there are many hopes now. I am afraid that the effects I get will be very limited. This is very shameful. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Xiaogang Shipping Companies Request Relief Again</h3>
<p>Because the Rental Price Set by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is Low</p>
<p>Request the Municipal Government to Find Ways to Mediate</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Xiaogang shipping companies in this city, due to the implementation of the Longqing joint transportation, all five ships, Wutai, Litai, Dechun, Yingchun, and Qinghai, which sail between Qingdao and Haizhou, have been affected and have no cargo to load. They once suspended operations and petitioned the municipal government on a large scale, requesting relief. The municipal government authorities then summoned representatives of the Xiaogang shipping companies and Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to discuss maintenance measures. Because the key points were not obtained at that time, Li Shuzhou and He Ren'an, representatives of the municipal shipping association, were dispatched by the municipal shipping association to Shanghai to earnestly negotiate with General Manager Liu (Hongsheng). As a result of the consultation, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company agreed to temporarily rent one ship (rental price of 2,000 yuan per month) from the five ships that sail on the Haiqing route to carry out joint transportation. If it is not enough in the future, continue to add rentals from the five ships until the five ships are rented out. If there is still not enough ships after the five ships are all rented, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company can freely add ships, and promised to set aside 50% of the income surplus to subsidize the five ships to maintain operations. The representatives immediately returned to Qingdao to report. After receiving the report, the shipping association immediately sent a letter to the five ship owners, inquiring about their opinions on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's rental of ships. Because the matter concerns the interests of the five ships themselves, they have held several consultations and all agree that the five ships, such as Yuantai, have always belonged to the same route and have always worked together. Moreover, in the face of great difficulties, survival is at stake. They are more determined to carry out the determination of sharing interests to the end. They put forward three measures and requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to recognize them: (1) Rental price. According to the opinion letter of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the standard is Yuantai, with a monthly rental price of 2,000 yuan. Such a low amount is not only unprofitable, but also causes losses. The monthly expenses and the minimum rental price of each ship are listed separately. (Table omitted) (2) Please have China Merchants Steam Navigation Company transfer the Tonghua ship, which is currently sailing on the Longqing route, to another place. If Tonghua continues to sail on the Longqing route, then only one of the five ships will be rented to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the other four ships will have no opportunity to rent. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer Tonghua to another place to meet the necessary measures for relief. (3) Please do not load single cargo on joint transportation ships and only load and unload at the Big Port, so that the small port ships sailing to Dapu can share a little bit, so that the business will not be affected and can be maintained. Moreover, the boundaries can be clearly defined. The ship owners then replied to the shipping association with the above-resolved measures. In addition to sending representative Li Shuzhou to Shanghai to earnestly negotiate with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the shipping association also sent a letter to the municipal chamber of commerce to forward to the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau, entrusting the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to provide relief and maintenance from beginning to end, and to slightly increase the rental price to facilitate mediation. It is heard that after receiving the report, the municipal government believed that the Xiaogang shipping companies' statements were all true and could not sit idly by. It specially sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai, requesting it to support private shipping and accommodate the measures proposed by the company. (15th)</p>
<h3>Commerce in Jiangxi Province Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>Prosperity in Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Decline in Outer Counties is Desperate</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Before the Lantern Festival is the summary period of the year's commerce. In this year, Jiangxi's commerce is particularly prosperous in the provincial capital and desperately declining in the outer counties. The reason is very simple: the outer counties are devastated by natural disasters, man-made disasters, floods, droughts, soldiers, and bandits. The rural areas have collapsed, local products have disappeared, and farmers not only have no purchasing power, but also transportation is blocked and travelers are deterred. Except for the porters who follow the military, there is no commerce to speak of. However, the provincial capital has become a haven for the middle and upper classes from all over the country to avoid bandits. The armies suppressing the communists also regard Nanchang as the rear center. In addition, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is stationed in Jiangxi, and dignitaries gather here. Therefore, the market has developed into an abnormal prosperity. Among them, the banking and money industries are in the lead, followed by the hotel industry. Several hotels such as the Huayuan Hotel and the Da Hotel are often used as headquarters for chairmen, ministers, commanders-in-chief, and general commanders. Even military officers and brigade commanders from various provinces who come to Jiangxi to receive training use them as their residences. As for apartments, inns, and academic societies, they are also filled with middle and lower-level military officers, dependents, and personnel waiting for appointments, and there is no place that is not full. Next are Beijing pastry shops, food stores, and restaurants. On the one hand, due to the increase in consumers, and on the other hand, due to the low prices of agricultural by-products such as pork, fish, flour, and other raw materials in rural areas, the profit is of course quite considerable. Foreign groceries and cloth shops, due to the large number of sales and fierce competition, although the interest rate is seen as light, most of them have a surplus. Military uniforms and leather goods, in order to meet the special needs of the anti-bandit military center, major military clothing stores in Jinghan have come to the city to set up joint branches. This industry can be considered extremely prosperous in the past two years. The grain industry has no major transactions last year except for military rice due to the disappearance of exports. However, those who run the market have a small supply, which does not meet the demand. The grain of the outer counties and farmers, with no economic organization, is eager to sell, and the price is manipulated by rice brokers. There is profit in both directions. The construction industry is busy because the city is being transformed, roads are being opened everywhere, and the New Games are working hard to renovate the city. However, larger construction projects are all won by outsiders (Jiangxia gangs) who have seized the host's territory. The Western medicine industry has made rapid progress in business due to the large number of troops gathered and the increasing number of temporary hospitals. The cigarette industry still cannot kill its momentum in this new life. In the past two years, there has been a newly emerging radio business, because the headquarters set up a broadcasting station, and military radio stations are numerous, so the business is also a blockbuster. In addition, industries such as cotton yarn, homespun cloth, and native paper are declining due to the dumping of foreign goods and the fact that poor rural areas are completely occupied by bandits. In general, most of the industries in the city last year had more profits than losses, so there were no closed stores. Compared with the desolate scenery elsewhere, it can be considered uniquely blessed.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province to Hold Land Reporting</h3>
<p>—Sponsored by the Department of Civil Affairs—</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Department of Civil Affairs recently presented a request to the provincial government to hold land reporting for clearance due to the province's chaotic land registration and deep-rooted malpractices in land tax. The provincial government committee decided at its 35th meeting on February 6 to hand it over to the department for sponsorship, without setting up an agency for the time being to save costs. Currently, the Department of Civil Affairs plans to start in Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Changle, Gutian, Minqing, Yongtai, Fuqing and other counties near the provincial capital, and then gradually expand it. However, this task is complicated and tedious, and our province is still in its infancy. It is necessary to collect ideas and benefit from each other in order to be effective. It is planned to set up a land reporting conference as a guiding research planning agency. In addition to the directors of the civil and finance departments as ex officio members, the conference will also be assigned two members each by the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance, and one member each by the provincial government, the Secretariat, the Department of Construction, and the Department of Education, and one member each by the relevant counties, and several experts will be hired to serve as members, with the directors of the civil and finance departments serving as standing members. A secretary and several staff members will be set up separately, and they will be appointed by the people from the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance without additional pay. A regular meeting will be held once a week, and the venue will be located in the Department of Civil Affairs. Once the regulations have been drafted and submitted to the provincial government for approval, the organization can be started. As for the land survey report of Minhou County in the provincial capital, it was first held in January this year. Of the 12 districts in the county, except for the 11th and 12th districts, which cannot be carried out due to the unrest of the bandits, the remaining districts have been completed, costing more than 7,000 yuan. The number of mu obtained is more than 60,000 mu in the first district, more than 80,000 mu in the second district, more than 30,000 mu in the third district, more than 60,000 mu in the fourth district, more than 50,000 mu in the fifth district, more than 70,000 mu in the sixth district, more than 80,000 mu in the seventh district, more than 20,000 mu in the eighth district, more than 30,000 mu in the ninth district, and more than 100,000 mu in the tenth district. According to the statistics, there should be 580,000 mu of farmland in the county, while the amount of land tax paid in the grain book is only 160,000 mu. It is more than 2.5 times higher. Therefore, the authorities expect that at least twice as much land tax will be increased annually when the land reporting of the province is completed. In addition, the land disputes in the newly recovered bandit areas in western Fujian have been difficult to resolve so far. Currently, Changting has organized a rural restoration committee to conduct land registration. The people will report the location and number of mu of all land to the committee. If the verification is true and there is no dispute, a deed will be given to them for management, and a registration fee of 5 per thousand will be charged according to the real estate. All the land rent and house rent owed by tenants and tenants before the recovery will be exempted, regardless of the amount, and no recovery will be allowed to avoid disputes. (16th)</p>
<h3>Completion of the Anhui Overseas Chinese Happy Village</h3>
<p>Qualified Overseas Chinese Gather in Wuhu to Develop Wasteland</p>
<p>A Total of Ten Thousand Acres of Land and Complete Residential Halls</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In the Shuiyang Town area of Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, nearly five hundred returned Overseas Chinese have gathered over the years, according to recent surveys. Most are from Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, returning from countries such as Britain, the United States, and Mexico. They are engaged in reclamation or the management of local products, establishing a foundation for Overseas Chinese to develop industries in the country. To unite and jointly seek development, they organized the Xuancheng Shuiyang Returned Overseas Chinese Industry Advancement Association, electing Gan Bingkun as the executive director to be responsible for all matters. Later, Chen Shuren, chairman of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, personally inspected the area, expressing great appreciation. Motivated by the desire to assist and develop projects to aid Overseas Chinese forced to return home in recent years, he successively purchased about 11,000 acres of mountainous land in the Huangnidang area between Shuiyang Town and Cixi Town to build the Overseas Chinese Happy Village. A management office was set up in Shuiyang Town, with Xi Rongxi as the director, Gan Bingkun as the executive of the administrative section, Wu Mingjian as the executive of the technical section, and Huang Mingsheng and He Yulong as agricultural technicians. Five residential buildings, one large auditorium, one warehouse, one public kitchen, and one cooperative were built. Now that the scale has been established, registration for new returned Overseas Chinese is underway to allow them to settle and cultivate the land. However, because more than a thousand people have applied for registration certificates, it is necessary to impose some restrictions at the beginning of the project. The first batch of 55 qualified applicants includes Chen Lihai and Huang Ao, among others. The majority are from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, returning from Japan, accounting for 38 people. According to age statistics, 4 are over 50 years old, 13 are over 40 years old, 33 are over 30 years old, and 5 are over 20 years old. The cultivation methods are divided into three categories: labor-capital cooperation, loans, and self-funded cultivation. For self-defense, it is planned to train the settlers and organize a national defense team. Once the first batch achieves results, the second and third batches will be reviewed successively and sent in a steady stream. Therefore, the construction of the Overseas Chinese Happy Village is currently planning to add six residential buildings. The 55 qualified people are scheduled to gather in Wuhu around the 20th of this month and travel together. The Overseas Chinese Happy Village Management Office has sent Executive Gan Bingkun to Wuhu to set up a reception center at the Jiangkou Huayang Hotel to provide accommodation. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee has also introduced Zhong Chongmin, who recently returned from Cuba, to conduct an inspection. Zhong passed through Wuhu yesterday and has already departed.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Fortune Teller's Fraud Exposed</p>
<p>A wandering fortune teller named Ge Tianmin resided in room Yuan of the Songweilu Township Inn outside the west gate, using deceptive means to attract people to tell fortunes. On the 11th of this month, Lu Zhibo, a resident of Qingsongshi, and his friend Yin Baoqing went to have their fortunes told. Ge initially demanded ten yuan for the fortune-telling fee, then reduced it to one yuan and two jiao. After receiving the payment, he said that he would discuss the details the next day. On the morning of the 13th, Ge said that the gentleman's fortune this year was prosperous. If he wanted great wealth, he must prepare a small wooden Buddha statue, along with three sacrificial animals and five hundred yuan in banknotes and foreign currency, as well as gold, jewelry, and other treasures, to offer before the Buddha. Then, the fortune teller would perform a ritual to obtain ten times the wealth, claiming that the more offered, the more effective it would be. Lu was bewitched and moved, and he worked hard to raise the money. On the afternoon of the 16th, after 8:00 PM, he first sent the three sacrificial animals, then brought the money. While he was performing the ritual, an onlooker recognized it as a scam and advised him not to be fooled. They reported it to the Second Public Security Sub-bureau, which sent police to investigate. In addition to the three sacrificial animals, a small wooden Buddha statue was found in a tin box among the tea leaves. Ge was taken to the station along with the items. Under interrogation, he confessed without denial. Magistrate Lang deemed it a fraud case and transferred it to the county bureau for referral to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Yellow Disaster Committee Member Causes Trouble at Prostitute's Home and Police Station</p>
<p>Liu Shouyi, a native of Changzhou, claiming to be a member of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, came to Suzhou a few days ago and stayed at the Huayuan Hotel. That night, he caused a disturbance at the home of a singing girl named Yan Furong, destroying property. The police were immediately notified, and he was detained. He then smashed the case files in the pre-trial room of the Third Public Security Sub-bureau and was transferred to the Public Security Bureau, then to the district prosecutor's office. After interrogation by the prosecutor and verification that he had no mental illness, he was ordered to be detained pending trial.</p>
<p>Transfer of Three Branch Bureau Chiefs</p>
<p>Wang Xunxiang, acting chief of the Sixth Public Security Branch Bureau in Jiaozhi Township, was ordered to transfer to Guangfu Township as a patrol officer. Xie Guoan, chief of the First Branch Bureau, was transferred to fill the vacancy. Yan Lian was appointed as the chief of the First Branch Bureau. The chiefs of the branch bureaus assumed their posts yesterday (17th) after receiving their appointments.</p>
<p>Clash Between Villagers and Refugees</p>
<p>Near Shijiacun, at the border of Suzhou and Changzhou, over two hundred refugees from Hunan Province arrived a few days ago. They demanded food from the villagers, who refused. This led to a clash. Because the refugees outnumbered the villagers, more than twenty villagers were injured. The security team arrived after hearing the news and suppressed the refugees, driving them out of the area.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Establishment of Additional Central Guidance Centers</p>
<p>Zhou Yuandong, deputy director of the sericulture model area in this county, stated that with the spring silkworm season approaching, the vast rural area of Wuxi is insufficient for the existing five central guidance centers to provide guidance. He specifically plans to establish ten centers in Beifangqian, Nanfangqian, Bashiqiao, Luoshe, Zhanghui, Daixiang, Houtang, Nanqiao, Anzhen, Qianzhou, and other places. Yesterday (17th) morning at 9:00 AM, the area dispatched investigators, including Wu Mengying and ten others, to conduct surveys in the countryside, requiring all surveys to be completed before the 20th. It is scheduled to officially establish the centers and begin work on March 1st. All eighty ordinary guidance centers in the four townships have also been decided to be established to promote sericulture.</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank Organizes Production and Sales Cooperatives</p>
<p>The Wuxi Farmers Bank experienced rapid business development last year. In the loan sector, excluding loans from agricultural warehouses and savings departments, the total loans for agriculture, livestock, and sericulture reached hundreds of thousands of yuan. Now, to accurately understand the actual situation of these production loans in rural areas, the bank plans to send personnel to various villages to conduct household surveys. In addition, the bank believes that the organization and number of cooperatives in the county are not numerous. Most of the established cooperatives are for credit and purchasing, but there are few production and sales cooperatives, which are most needed by farmers. Therefore, it is necessary to actively promote them. Currently, the bank manager, Gu Shuzhi, is planning a plan to organize thirty production and sales cooperatives in different regions to promote the production of rice, wheat, sericulture, and pig breeding, and to improve the transportation and sales methods after production and harvest, aiming to complete the work within three months.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Police Clash with Gamblers in Nanzha</p>
<p>Hao Yulin, director of the Public Security Bureau, has been personally inspecting the villages and towns in recent days due to the rampant gambling during the abolished Lunar New Year, arresting gamblers and sending them to the county for trial and sentencing, with several cases occurring every day. Yesterday (15th) at approximately 8:00 PM, he sent patrol officer Yan Chengqi, leading a patrol team in a vehicle, to Nanzha Dongya Tea House to arrest gamblers. They apprehended six gamblers and took them to the bus station. While there, they mistakenly arrested Jiang, the principal of Nanzha Elementary School, and Liu Baoshu, a dumpling shop worker, who were closing up shop. They were identified as gamblers and taken to the Commercial Corps, which agitated hundreds of businessmen and residents of the street and town, who demanded the release of Principal Jiang and the shop worker. The police officers refused, and the crowd pulled the gamblers away. They then rushed to the bus station and seized all the apprehended gamblers. At that time, bricks and stones were flying, and the patrol officers fired their revolvers into the air as a warning. The villagers immediately sounded gongs to gather a crowd, and the doors and windows of the station were destroyed, and five bicycles were damaged. Patrolman Chuan Xitai sustained minor injuries. Chief Yan and the patrol officers broke through and fled along the Xicheng Road back to the bureau, arriving around 11:00 PM, and reported the situation to Director Hao for handling.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Agricultural Bank Manager Detained</p>
<p>Xu Zhiming, the former owner of Yongyuan Qianzhuang and manager of the Agricultural Bank in front of the temple, was found to have suffered losses of over 400,000 yuan due to imprudent lending by the two banks. Unable to maintain operations, both banks collapsed simultaneously last spring. Xu Zhiming immediately fled and disappeared. He was subsequently arrested, and various businesses provided a written guarantee of 120,000 yuan to secure his release, hoping that he would find a way to repay the debts. Unexpectedly, Xu did not fulfill the repayment contracts with the creditors. Recently, he was jointly sued by Tao Xiaodong, Tao Jinji, Zhi Junying, Chen Yuncai, Zhou Huisheng, and others. Xu appeared in court, stating that he owed approximately 280,000 yuan, while others owed him 320,000 yuan. If he could collect the debts on time, there would be a surplus. However, due to the difficulty in collecting debts, he was unable to repay his debts. The plaintiffs demanded some initial repayment, but Xu was unable to pay. As a result, he was ordered to be detained.</p>
<p>Hunan Refugees Cause Disturbances While Passing Through</p>
<p>Over two hundred refugees from Hunan Province, both men and women, arrived in the territory from Wuxi on the 14th. While passing through Yangjian, the refugees, relying on their numbers, looted at will in the town, capturing chickens and ducks everywhere to cook and eat. The townspeople were greatly alarmed and closed the market. Fortunately, the town's business corps and the local patrol made a strong effort to suppress them, patrolling all night, and no accidents occurred. The next morning, the Public Security Bureau sent police to assist in escorting them out. When they arrived at Liantang Town, they again engaged in misconduct. The town mayor raised approximately 20,000 cash as a dinner fee, and the town also tightened security. The Public Security Bureau, fearing that the refugees would cause trouble, dispatched Inspector Jiao Jitung, leading police to the countryside, to conduct an armed crackdown and guard them overnight at Jinghui Temple. It was decided to expel them from the territory on the 16th, sending them on foot along the highway to Suzhou.</p>

<p>Qiada Bank Suffers Major Theft and Fire</p>
<p>Lai Yinhong, the town mayor of Wenyun Town in Xiaoshan, had accumulated a considerable surplus from opening the Qiada Bank. As a result of the bank's year-end settlement at the end of the abolished Lunar New Year, the cash on hand was quite substantial. It was reported that more than 11,000 banknotes in Lai's bedroom cabinet were suddenly stolen the night before (11th). The case is still under investigation. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out in the bank's warehouse behind the bank on the morning of the 12th. At that time, a fierce west wind was blowing, and the fire spread rapidly and uncontrollably. Over a hundred bags of rice from the massive rice storehouse in the warehouse, as well as tin foil mortgaged from Yonghe Foil Shop, and several houses of Lai's wholesale tobacco leaves and Suihe Mill's wheat were all destroyed. The total loss is estimated at two to three thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Ye Chunnian, representing the Chairman Group, reported: "Distinguished guests and fellow Boy Scouts of the city, the four comrades of the Boy Scouts of this city sacrificed their lives while participating in the war zone service during the January 28th Incident. We have built this symbolic tomb for them and are holding the completion ceremony today. These four comrades are members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group, which is also the 40th Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts. Their ranks and names are Senior Boy Scout Luo Yunxiang, Intermediate Boy Scouts Ying Wen-da, Bao Zhengwu, and Mao Zhengxiang. Because they adhered to the mission of the Boy Scouts, and based on the purpose and objectives of the group, they served the public and worked for the country regardless of everything. Their spirit is truly loyal and courageous, and their actions were extremely heroic. However, they went out to save refugees and never returned. It is rumored that someone witnessed them being tied up by the enemy on Sichuan Road. This is enough to show that they were killed. If we believe their indomitable and tragic state in the face of the enemy's intimidation and torture, and their bodies were destroyed by the enemy and could not be found, we call them martyrs. We can simply call them four of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the revolutions and national crises since the Republic of China. Although the remains of the martyrs cannot be found, we believe that the souls of the martyrs must have a destination. The purpose of building this symbolic tomb is, on the one hand, to summon their souls, and on the other hand, to praise the spirit and deeds of the martyrs, providing a target for mourning for those who die later and arousing awareness. Three years ago, after the martyrs disappeared, preparations began to build this tomb. The total cost of goods was more than 1,500 yuan, of which 1,000 yuan was donated by the Chinese Red Cross, and the rest was allocated from the funds of all executive supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and this group. The cemetery was donated by this cemetery, and the drawings were made by members of this group, which did not cost any money. We have been raising funds and running around for three years. At times, the night state personnel were mobilized to work day and night. At this point, we still have a few hopes: (1) If we can find a way to build a Boy Scout bronze statue for this martyrs' tomb, it will add color to the tomb and be more hopeful. (2) Because the four martyrs are the souls of the Republic of China and the flowers of doctrine, their experiences are well worth being praised by the government and compiled into the history of the Republic of China, so that they will be remembered forever. This is not only the glory of Shanghai, but also the glory of the nation. Finally, our work of honoring the martyrs can be said to have come to an end, but this is not our greatest contribution to the martyrs. Our greatest contribution to the martyrs is to continue the martyrs' wishes, recognize our environment, aim at our enemies, and bury ourselves in our work in a real and practical way. If we can do a little, we will be worthy of the martyrs. If we can do a little, we will reduce our shame on the martyrs by a little. I hope that I will encourage myself, and I also hope that you will encourage everyone, so that the significance and value of today's ceremony can be said to be significant. Done."</p>
<p>Tong's Speech</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, the unveiling was conducted by the Mayor's representative. Then, Tong Xingbai gave a speech, saying, "The 50th Regiment of the Chinese Boy Scouts engaged in rescue work for refugees and wounded soldiers during the January 28th Shanghai War. The four comrades, Luo, Ying, Bao, and Mao, were harmed by the Japanese army. Because their bodies were lost after death, we established a symbolic tomb to commemorate them. The actions of the four martyrs have greatly touched us spiritually: (1) The four martyrs died unnaturally and by violence. This shows the cruelty and unreasonableness of imperialism. Ordinary troops do not harm those who surrender and people in charitable organizations. Unarmed people cannot be killed. However, the Boy Scouts were engaged in rescue work, but they were not helped. However, the four martyrs have some honor even though they died. (2) The Boy Scouts' own mission is to help mankind. Because they saw the large number of refugees and wounded people in the battlefield, they followed the spirit of service, and went through hardships, and rescued many soldiers and civilians. Their service spirit to human beings and society is commendable. The so-called 'sacrificing one's life for justice and killing oneself for benevolence' is worthy of our model. Today, we are here to commemorate the four martyrs, and we should inherit the four martyrs' wills and carry them forward. The whole expression of the spirit of the Boy Scouts can be seen here. The training work has made considerable achievements. If we base ourselves on this ambition and promote it to the whole people, the country can have a chance to avenge its shame. The symbolic tomb is still small, and we should actively find ways to erect a bronze statue of the four martyrs so that they will be remembered forever."</p>
<p>Li and Wang's Speeches</p>
<p>Then Li Dachao gave a speech, saying, "In this solemn, great, and profound commemoration, the sacrifice of the four martyrs has given us a good lesson. The result of the January 28th war and resistance issued a line of national glory. Although the martyrs died, they still live. After the completion of the symbolic tomb and the participation of all sectors of society, we should use the spirit of the martyrs to save the country and revive the nation." Then Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech on behalf of Zhu Boyuan, saying, "The four martyrs served in the Chamber of Commerce in the past, but they died during the Shanghai War. Today, it is not only something to mourn, but also something to congratulate. Death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. The death of the martyrs is heavier than Mount Tai. It is worth dying and will be remembered forever. We, the survivors, should shake our spirits and take on the work of saving the country and the people, so that we will not be ashamed of the four martyrs. A young reporter once talked about a valuable life, "I am for everyone," and a valuable death, "Everyone is for me." This is really a wise saying." Next, Yu Zuoting delivered a speech on behalf of Zheng Chengqing, saying, "After the disappearance of the four martyrs, the Shanghai Municipal Council was negotiated to rescue them. Although the Japanese verbally agreed to find them, the martyrs had already been wiped out at this time. Today, the tomb has been completed and only their clothes are buried, which is very sad. However, on the national spirit, it is gratifying. As the country is still in trouble, all people should inherit the wishes of the four martyrs, avenge their shame and strive for strength. If we can do this, I deeply know that the four martyrs will smile under Jiuquan." Finally, Qu Yue delivered a speech. The words were omitted.</p>
<p>Unveiling Situation</p>
<p>After the speeches, the unveiling was held. All representatives gathered in front of the symbolic tomb. In the melodious sound of the Boy Scout music, Li Dachao, the Mayor's representative, unveiled the Party and National flag pre-covering the tombstone. The entire body paid respects to the martyrs' portraits and symbolic tombs. The Chairman Group presented flowers. Finally, the Boy Scouts sang mournful songs, and the ceremony was declared complete. At 11:48 AM, they returned to Shanghai by special train. At about 12:00 PM, they arrived.</p>
<p>Construction Process</p>
<p>The symbolic tomb of the four martyrs is located in the Yongmao Industrial Company's Jiazi District Jizihao tomb in the Shanghai Cemetery in the Yinhang District of Baoshan County in the northern suburbs of Shanghai. It is 20 English feet long and 10 English feet and 6 inches wide. The land was donated by the Shanghai Cemetery, and Jinshan Stone Workshop built it. The drawing design, supervision, and supervision were undertaken by Mr. Yu Xueren, a member of the third group of this group. Construction started in August of the 20th year of the Republic of China and was completed in October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. All Jinshan stone materials were used, with a total cost of 1,520 yuan.</p>
<p>Excerpts from the Mourning Elegies</p>
<p>Many mourning elegies were sent by Party and National leaders and all sectors of society. Excerpts are as follows: Chairman Lin: "Spiritual Dedication to the National Disaster," Wang Zhaoming: "Model This National Disaster," Chiang Kai-shek: "Righteous Spirit Will Last Forever," Sun Ke: "Rest in Peace, Loyal Souls," Chen Lifu: "What is hated is worse than death, what is desired is better than life, only the four martyrs can do it," Wu Tiecheng: "Sleep on Brushwood and Taste Gall," Pan Gongzhan: "Heroic Sacrifice," Yu Youren: "Blue Blood and Heroic Spirits, Casting Great Virtue, Youth Leaders, Comparable to the Shrine of Loyalty," Dai Chuanxian: "Comparable to Wang and Tong," Yu Zuoting: "Righteousness and Loyalty are Admirable,"</p>

<p>Ambassador Yan's Response</p>
<p>Ambassador Yan then gave a response, briefly saying that he took leave to return to the country last year, and a year has passed in an instant.

This time, he is very grateful for the strong support of all the gentlemen in facilitating his trip to Russia. In the future, he will uphold the good intentions of all the gentlemen and bring honor to the country, and so on. There was a joyful exchange of toasts, and the guests and hosts bid farewell and dispersed at 2:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Asks the Manufacturers' Association to Collect National Products for Exhibition in Anhui</h3>
<p>Shaoxing National Exhibition to Open on the 1st of Next Month</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers' Association received an official letter from the Anhui Provincial Government yesterday, letter number Shi Zi No. 959, stating that the industry and commerce of this province are extremely immature, and in recent years, they have become increasingly withered. If we want to seek ways to promote them, it is not just one end. The easiest and most effective way is the mobile exhibition. This kind of exhibition is no different from a temporary market. It can both promote and sell, which is really a win-win situation. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation in this province, the goods produced in various counties and the various products of other provinces were unable to be sold smoothly due to transportation difficulties. Now, the highways of this province run through the north and south, which not only facilitates the travel of travelers, but also has a great relationship with the prosperity of agriculture, industry and commerce in various counties. In order to arouse public attention to the relationship between highways and agriculture, industry and commerce, it is specially decided to hold a mobile exhibition of goods along the Wutun Road when the Wutun Road is opened to traffic on April 1 this year. At the same time, we also plan to collect as many national products from foreign manufacturers as possible, so as to learn from each other and facilitate sales. I have always thought that your association has spared no effort to promote national products. In addition to sending personnel to meet in person, I hereby attach ten copies of the association's regulations and compilation, please check and collect them on my behalf, send them for exhibition, and hope to reply. After receiving the letter, the association believed that promoting national products is indeed the current key to saving the country. Since the Anhui Provincial Government is enthusiastic about promoting them, it should do its best to assist them and promote their success. However, the location of the exhibition is of great importance to the effectiveness of the exhibition and promotion. Therefore, the association decided at yesterday's standing committee meeting that, in addition to replying to the Anhui Provincial Government that it would collect national products on its behalf, it also decided to send personnel to Anhui within the next few days to inspect the terrain along the Wutun Road in order to determine the exhibition site and notify manufacturers to go and participate together. It was also reported that the Shaoxing County National Products Exhibition, which was initiated by the China National Products Manufacturers' Association, has been deeply supported and welcomed by all sectors of the county since it contacted the Party and government agencies of Shaoxing County. In order to prepare quickly, the County Party Department specially organized a Preparatory Committee for the National Products Exhibition, which was responsible for assisting in the preparations by various agencies in the county and actively carrying out preparations. Yesterday, according to the secretariat of the association, Liu Zhongying, a member of the standing committee of the association, had already sent a telegram to the association after going to Shaoxing to inspect the venue and negotiate all the preparatory matters, saying that the venue had been found in the county's cloth industry association, and it was decided to officially open on the first of next month.</p>

Among those present were Chen Lingyi, Wang Ruizhu, Wen Si, Yang Zhihao, Shi Liang, Liu Jichen, Chen Fengxi, and Guo Zhenyi.

<h3>The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Writes to Various Counties to Purchase Rice for Relief Loans</h3>
<p>The Tax Administration Approved the Tax-Exempt Purchase Method</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association believes that with the spring harvest still far away, purchasing rice for relief loans is an urgent task. It has obtained the approval of the Tax Administration for tax-exempt purchase of foreign rice and sent a notice to various counties in Zhejiang Province to raise funds for the purchase. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter Requesting the Purchase of Rice for Relief Loans</p>
<p>The association yesterday sent separate letters to the county governments of 26 counties in Zhejiang Province, including Shaoxing, Shangyu, Jinhua, Jiaxing, and Haining, stating that the association considered spring relief to be more important than winter relief and was eager to carry it out. It had been decided that the foreign rice requested for tax exemption would be distributed at the original price. The counties where the association and the Drought Relief Charity Association and the Jisheng Association were giving relief loans would combine to print and send the methods for purchasing tax-exempt foreign rice. The government was requested to check and handle the matter. If this foreign rice was needed, please notify the association within the time limit for preliminary registration. Those exceeding the quota would be regretted, so please raise funds and place an order as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tax-Exempt Purchase Method</p>
<p>The tax-exempt purchase method for foreign rice is recorded as follows: (1) Counties where the association and the Drought Relief Charity Association of various provinces and the Jisheng Association are giving relief loans can request the association to purchase tax-exempt foreign rice if they can raise funds themselves to increase spring relief loans. Each county is limited to 5,000 piculs. The quantity of rice purchased and the date of rice collection must be notified to the association within this month. (2) For the fixed purchase of foreign rice, regardless of the near or far term, each picul of 156 catties (municipal picul) must first pay a deposit of 8 jiao. Five days before the due date, the full price must be deposited in the bank designated by the association.

<h3>Disaster Relief Association's Investigation of Disaster Relief in Seven Counties of Henan Province</h3>
<p>The Provincial Disaster Relief Association recently received a report from Li Zizhong and Guo Fangwu, the chief and deputy directors in charge of investigating and distributing aid in Henan Province. According to their report, the association adheres to the principles of investigating and distributing aid, prioritizing the dying over the poor, strictly scrutinizing and generously distributing. Instructions were sent to the aid distribution officers in various counties to strictly verify and distribute aid, avoiding any extravagance. The reports on the handling of the situation in Hua County, Fengqiu County, Lan County, Xihua County, Shangshui County, Lin County, and Huaiyang County are hereby announced as follows:</p>
<p>Hua County: The aid distribution officers Gan Fangzhao and Ma Xijiu telegraphed on the [missing day] of the first month, stating that they arrived in Hua County on the 21st of the first month. At that time, government officials, gentry, and disaster victims welcomed them in groups outside the city, showing their eagerness for relief. On the 22nd, the county magistrate convened the Flood Relief Association and various public organizations to a meeting in the county government to solicit opinions from all parties. Everyone agreed that it was difficult to purchase large quantities of grain nearby, and transporting it from afar would take time. The starving disaster victims, except for some who were eating at the porridge kitchens, were still trapped in the floods. Wading through shallow ice and deep water was difficult, and they were awaiting rescue with impatience. For the sake of rapid relief, it was still appropriate to directly distribute funds. On the 24th, they set off in groups to the three areas with the most severe disaster situation (the 5th, 6th, and 7th districts) to quickly investigate and distribute aid, in order to fulfill the original purpose of disaster relief as saving lives. It is estimated that each district will be allocated 5,000 yuan to help 4,000 people. The remaining 5,000 yuan will be used to assist as many disaster victims waiting for relief as possible who have not received porridge. However, the flooded area is vast, and boat crossings are blocked by shallow ice, while walking on the ice is hindered by the floods. Transportation is difficult, and it may take some time. A map of the disaster area is attached (omitted).</p>
<p>Fengqiu: The aid distribution officer Zhang Qinglin stated in a letter dated the 22nd of the first month that he left the province on the 17th. Because both sides of the Liu County ferry crossing were frozen, making it difficult to cross the river, he transferred to a car to Zhengzhou, passed Xinxiang, and went directly to Daokou, where he took a car. Unexpectedly, the Daokou car was also unable to operate due to the ice and snow, so he hired a local vehicle and arrived at Fengqiu on the 21st. According to the investigation, the county has suffered from yellow locust plagues for consecutive years, and the floodwaters continue to rise and have not receded to this day. There are over 70,000 disaster victims wandering about and on the verge of death. He is currently working with the county magistrate and disaster relief personnel to conduct a detailed investigation in the disaster area. Once the investigation is completed and the relief fund of 10,000 yuan is allocated, it will be distributed after verification. However, transportation is inconvenient here, and there is no large supply of rice available locally, making purchasing and transporting it difficult. It is still appropriate to directly distribute funds. This is reported together. The aid distribution officer Wu Bangyan stated in a letter from Lan County that he arrived in Lan County by car on the 18th of the first month and met with the county magistrate. He invited representatives from local organizations to a meeting. Tomorrow, he will go to the 20-odd villages west of the river that were flooded for an on-site investigation. However, there are many disaster victims, and the relief fund of 500 yuan may not be enough to distribute. Furthermore, there is no large supply of grain here. It would cost time and money to purchase and transport it from elsewhere. It seems that it is still best to directly distribute cash to achieve rapid relief.</p>
<p>Xihua: The aid distribution officer Wang Gongrong stated in a letter dated the 23rd of the first month that after arriving in the county, the county magistrate convened a meeting to discuss relief measures. More than 20 people attended, including the head of the county party department, the Finance Committee, the Flood Relief Association, and the seven district heads. The following resolutions were made: (1) Based on the register of extremely poor disaster victims aided by the provincial relief association in the past, in accordance with the principles of this disaster relief and the purpose of saving the dying over the poor, personnel will be dispatched to conduct door-to-door investigations and create a separate register. Any omissions may be added after verification. (2) Seven investigators will be selected by the Flood Relief Association from honest and impartial personnel, and they will depart on the 24th, assisted by various districts, and complete the investigation within seven days. (3) After the register is completed, it will be reviewed and sampled by the county magistrate, the Flood Relief Association, and the aid distribution officer before relief tickets are issued. (4) Investigation travel expenses will be provided frugally and raised locally. However, purchasing grain here is very difficult. Buying in large quantities would create a supply-demand imbalance and raise prices, which is inevitable and difficult to do. If we go to Zhoukou to buy grain, the roads would be muddy due to rain and snow. Even the freight costs would be considerable. It still seems that it is best to distribute cash.</p>
<p>Shangshui: The aid distribution officer Lü Dongwang stated in a letter that the disaster area in Shangshui is too large and there are too many disaster victims. If the aid distribution officer led each group to conduct a door-to-door investigation in each district, it would take some time and it may not be possible to complete the distribution before the Lunar New Year. He discussed this with the county and the Relief Association and decided to assign an investigation team to each district to conduct an on-site investigation and create a register at the same time. The aid distribution officer will go to each district to conduct random checks after the teams depart to ensure verification. On the 30th of the first month and the 1st of the second month, they jointly went to the designated locations to supervise the completion of the distribution. A total of 720 yuan was distributed in the second district, 929 yuan in the third district, 1,500 yuan in the fourth district, 260 yuan in the sixth district, and 300 yuan in the first and fifth districts, totaling 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Lin County: The aid distribution officer Wang Yinnan stated in a letter that on the 25th of January, the investigators finally sent in the registers of disaster victims that had been investigated. That afternoon, he went to various places with the staff of the Flood Relief Association to conduct door-to-door verification. However, due to the heavy snow and mud, the verification took a great deal of time. He departed at 5:00 AM every day and went to bed at 10:00 PM, filling out daily report forms. Once the verification is complete, the aid will be distributed. The relief fund of 4,000 yuan has been received. However, there are many difficulties in purchasing grain, so it seems that it is still best to distribute funds.</p>
<p>Huaiyang: The aid distribution officer Guo Dingfu stated in a letter that after leaving the province, due to the heavy rain and snow, he did not arrive in the county until the 23rd of the first month. On the 24th, a meeting was held in the county government office, and the district heads and personnel from various agencies were present. He explained the purpose of this emergency relief, which was to prioritize the serious cases and save the dying over the poor. He gave the district heads five days to report the most severely affected disaster victims in detail, and then he would personally conduct a follow-up investigation. According to the investigation, the disaster situation in the seventh district is the most serious, followed by the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts. He plans to go to the seventh district with Captain Wan of the county government tomorrow to conduct an investigation. However, the roads here are muddy due to rain and snow, making transportation inconvenient. It is also not easy to purchase grain. It is still best to distribute funds.</p>
<h3>North and South Rice Groups of the Industry Association to Stop Measuring Rice for One Day</h3>
<p>The North and South Rice Groups of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association will hold a general meeting of all members of the North and South Rice Groups at the Cuixiutang Hall in the Yu Garden in the city at 10:00 AM today to decide on the case of collecting one yuan of ocean silver for each tail of received goods in the joint meeting of the North and South markets on the 15th of this month.

<h3>China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong Line Business Flourishes</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since the China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong line began carrying passengers, the business has been flourishing due to the increased speed and shorter travel time of the Douglas aircraft. For example, yesterday (Sunday), the plane from Guangdong to Shanghai carried one passenger each from Guangzhou to Shantou and Shanghai, and one passenger each from Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Wenzhou to Shanghai. The amount of mail has also increased significantly.</p>
<h3>National Bureau of Weights and Measures Orders the Promotion of the New System to Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Consulting various competent authorities to urge implementation</p>
<p>The National Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the fact that weights and measures are tools for civil transactions, and that the standards must be accurate and the use consistent, when the new system is first implemented, the order of doing things is mostly to first unify the cities and gradually reach the countryside, first urging the shops and then extending to the people. There is a distinction between the order of procedures, but in principle there is no difference in importance. Recently, the weights and measures testing institutes of various provinces and cities, as well as the testing sub-bureaus of various counties, reported the scope of their unification, which is mostly limited to shops in the cities. Residents in the cities and rural residents have not been given deep attention. In order to effectively promote the new system, the bureau yesterday consulted the governments of various provinces, cities, and counties to notify the competent authorities, as well as the testing institutes and testing personnel of the various sub-bureaus, to promote the system to urban residents and rural residents within a time limit, so as not to lose all previous efforts, and to thoroughly complete the unification of the new weights and measures system.</p>
<h3>Shipping Passenger Ticket Industry Association Requests Safeguarding Passenger Safety</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Passenger Ticket Industry Association, in view of the fact that the Taikoo Company's Tongzhou ship encountered pirates this time, and the general passengers suffered this great robbery and suffered considerable losses, convened the 42nd Executive Committee meeting a few days ago. At that time, it was resolved that: 1. Four measures will be proposed to the Taikoo Company for adoption and implementation to ensure the safety of passengers. 2. Join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>County Government Disallows Changes to the Qiansan Road-Qianhua Line</h3>
<p>The original route of the Qiansan Road-Qianhua section in the second district of Shanghai County. Local people said that the line was winding and the bridge construction would cost too much, so the eighth branch directly under the county had submitted to the county party department to request the county government to move the original central line half a mile to the south in order to make it more convenient and save on bridge construction. It is now known that the county government said that the original line was still straight, the original bridge could be used, and the engineering principles and route drawings had been submitted for verification and approval, and it was difficult to approve the changes. It has already sent a letter to the county party department for verification and notification.</p>

Now, with the planning of the Chairman and all members of the Huangshan Construction Committee, and the completion of the Hanghui Highway, it is even more beautiful than before. Last summer, the Huang She members took many excellent works, which were publicly exhibited in Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places, and received good reviews. Now, Mr. Zhang Shanzi is going to Nanyang to promote the scenery of the motherland to overseas Chinese. I am very pleased, etc. Then, Mr. Xu Shiying delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Ministry of Industry recently established the Qiaole Village in Xuancheng to recruit unemployed overseas Chinese to go to reclaim land. Xuancheng is very close to Huangshan. In the future, it is hoped that they will further move their human and financial resources to Taoyuan Village in Huangshan to engage in development. Then future construction will be very promising. Now, the construction of Huangshan is just beginning, and there is nothing to show for it. I hope that everyone will work together to make faster progress. Now Zhang Shanzi is promoting Huangshan as a painter, calligrapher, and poet. I firmly believe that it will be a great success, etc. Finally, Mr. Zhang Shanzi delivered a reply, briefly saying that he was flattered by the Huang She members' recommendation to go to Xingzhou for promotion, and by the praise of the two elders, Zhihui and Jingshan.

<h3>Yongkang County Government Cooperates in the Arrest of Two Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Evidence Must Be Presented</p>
<p>Before Approval for Transfer</p>
<p>The Yongkang County Government in Zhejiang Province learned that Wang Yanxing and Hu Xindou had been supplying firearms to the local communist troops in the county. Wang was a relative of the famous communist Huang Renzhong, and Hu had provided assistance when Ying Xizheng escaped from prison many years ago. Therefore, it ordered detectives to investigate the whereabouts of the two men. It has now been found that Wang and Hu are hiding at No. 207 Yuezhou Road, Shanghai. It then sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Court to issue arrest warrants No. 663. Yesterday, it ordered Ma Jinnan to come to Shanghai and request the cooperation of the Shanghai Department Patrol Room Chief Inspector's Office in the arrest. Chinese Detective Wang Cheng should cooperate with him to arrest Wang and Hu and take them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the Yongkang County Government, not a modern court, was requesting the transfer. According to the agreement, evidence should be presented before the transfer could be approved. Ma Jinnan then stated that the arrest of the defendant was based on the confession of a communist convict, Hu, but the confession was not brought with him. When Wang and Hu were questioned, they both denied having any connection with the Communist Party. The criminal judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confession and ordered that the case be postponed for one week and that the Yongkang County Government present substantial evidence for further review.</p>
<h3>Appeal Case of Two Major Criminals in the Assassination of Inspectors</h3>
<p>The Trial Has Been Concluded and the Verdict Will Be Announced on the 22nd</p>
<p>Liu Guobao from Sichuan, Li Shiying from Henan, and Li Zecai from Anhui participated in the assassination work of the reactionary faction. Between April and May of the 21st year of the Republic, they assassinated Wang Bin, an inspector of the Investigation Team of the Songhu Garrison Command, and Cao Qingcheng, an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, in front of the Gu'en Temple on Weier Meng Road in the French Concession and at the intersection of LaFayette Road and Xia Le Road. When killing Cao, they mistakenly killed Jin Shoupei from Baoshan due to mistaken identity. When the incident occurred, French patrol officers rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and arrested Liu and Li, seizing one pistol each. That night, Li Zecai was also arrested, and two pistols and handcuffs were seized. The French Police Department sent them to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and filed a public prosecution on charges of endangering the Republic and premeditated murder. At the end of the trial, Liu Guobao and Li Shiying were sentenced to life imprisonment for endangering the Republic and sentenced to death for murder, to be executed concurrently, and deprived of political rights for life. Li Zecai was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Later, because Liu and others refused to accept the verdict, they appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and ruled to revoke the original judgment and send the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. Now that the Third Branch of the High Court has completed the investigation of evidence, it once opened a collegiate bench for a trial, and the appellants extended their lawyers to the case for defense. Because the court needed to summon the French patrol officers who handled the case at that time, it ordered a postponement for further interrogation of the situation. It has been reported that this happened previously. This reporter had previously reported on the situation. On the morning of the day before, another collegiate bench was opened for a continued trial. The French Police Department was represented by a lawyer, and the defense lawyers for the appellants also arrived on time. Several patrol officers from the French Police Department arrived as ordered. After the court opened, it ordered Liu, Li, and Li, the three appellants, to be brought to court and interrogated one by one. Because the case involved politics, it was declared that no bystanders were allowed. It was heard that Liu and others all denied the accusations. After the witnesses and patrol officers were cross-examined, the prosecutor made a statement of opinion. After the police department lawyer and the lawyers for Liu and others debated with each other, the court declared the trial over and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 22nd. The three of Liu and others were still returned to the detention center to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Franc Case Verdict</h3>
<p>Chen Jiannan Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months in Prison</p>
<p>Chen Jiannan, a native of Wenzhou, 47 years old, who has been doing business and opening a restaurant in Brazil, recently returned to his hometown. He came to Shanghai on the 9th of last month and stayed in Room 5 of the Yong'an Flag Hotel at No. 24 Dongyouheng Road. He carried 516 counterfeit ten-franc coins, 920 five-franc coins, and four counterfeit two-yuan Chinese silver coins, intending to take them to Brazil for use. Wei Shanghe, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Department, learned of this and reported it to the chief, who cooperated with a Western detective to secretly go to the address and arrest him in the room. The above-mentioned francs and counterfeit silver coins, as well as 51 Shanghai genuine banknotes of five yuan each, were seized and sent to the First Special District Court. Later, an expert from the French Bank used photographic magnification to identify the francs as completely counterfeit. Chen claimed that he had purchased them for 100 yuan from a passenger when he arrived in Shanghai by boat from his hometown and did not know they were counterfeit. Therefore, the manufacturing agency could not be traced. He was instructed to wait for the verdict, and the defendant was returned to custody. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the court and sentenced Chen Jiannan to two years and six months in prison for collecting counterfeit currency and French francs with the intention of putting them into circulation. The number of days of detention before the final judgment was determined to be one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. The evidence was confiscated and the genuine banknotes were returned.</p>
<h3>French Concession Gambling Scam Appeal</h3>
<p>The Trial Has Been Concluded and Awaiting Verdict</p>
<p>Yang Yingchu from Guangdong, because he had nothing to do, was poor and bored, and had unrealistic ideas, fabricated in November of last year that the French Consul General Mei Liai had taken leave to return to his country, and a new Consul was taking office in Shanghai and wanted to restore the market and allow the opening of gambling houses. He was able to find a way to lobby and apply for a license. He boasted that his fellow villager, Pan Shucan, was the secretary of our country's minister to France and could achieve satisfactory results. He colluded with his fellow villager Wang Boqing and local Cai Baoshan and others to look for capitalists to invest in opening gambling houses. Jiang Futian, a translator from the French Police Department (now promoted to Chinese Detective Inspector), and Li Xianyang, and others learned of this. They disguised themselves as capitalists and invited Yang, Wang, Cai, Pan, and their accomplices Yang Dingguo, Zhu Zhenhua, and others to discuss and reach an agreement in Room 202 of the Dadongxin Hotel on Xixinqiao Street on November 30. The next day, they invited Yang and others to Room 301 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjiamuqiao Street to sign an investment contract and entrust Yang to proceed with obtaining the license. The police department sent detectives to ambush in the next room. When Yang and others arrived, after signing the contract, the detectives rushed in and arrested Yang and others, as well as suspects Pi Xidun and Fu Fengchi, and others, eight people in total. They seized evidence such as flower club rules and contracts from Yang Yingchu and Cai Baoshan's home and sent them to the Second Special Court. The police department lawyer filed a public prosecution on charges of fraud. At the end of the trial, Yang Yingchu was sentenced to six months in prison, Cai Baoshan was sentenced to three months in prison, Wang Boqing, Pan Shucan, Yang Dingguo, and Zhu Zhenhua were fined 200 yuan each, and Pi Xichun and Fu Fengchi were found not guilty. The details were recorded in the previous report. It is now known that Yang Yingchu, Cai Baoshan, and Wang Boqing refused to accept the original verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in hopes of exonerating themselves. The High Court, according to the petition, opened a collegiate bench for a trial the day before yesterday, with Court President Guo Dezhang, Sun Honglin, Jia Liang, and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer from the police department, appeared in court. Jiang and Li, the two translators from the French Police Department who handled the case, arrived as ordered to await interrogation. First, after the appellants stated the reasons for their dissatisfaction, the court questioned the witnesses Jiang and Li and the appellants in detail. After the debate, the court declared the trial over and ordered a scheduled verdict. The appellants were still returned to the detention center.</p>

<h3>National Government Orders the Award of the Caiyu Medal to Du Yong and Others</h3>
<p>All are Righteous, Courageous, and Tireless in Doing Good</p>

<h3>Laborers' Nursery School Changes Method of Admitting Children</h3>
<p>Internal Equipment Has Been Completed</p>
<p>The laborers' nursery school near Panfang on Penglai Road in Nanshi, Shanghai, has gradually improved its internal equipment since its establishment. However, the number of children admitted is very small because the general working class is still largely ignorant of the duties of the school. A reporter from the Xinben News Agency went to the school yesterday morning to inquire about the situation. According to Ms. Zhu Jicang, the director of the school, the recent progress has been quite detailed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose of Establishment</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu first stated that the purpose of establishing this school was for the children of the general working class. It is dedicated to admitting and entrusting children, and all aspects of support are based on the living standards of working families. As for the equipment, we strive for hygiene and arouse children's interest in life. The bathrooms, bedrooms, clinics, and game rooms are all suitable for the needs of general infants. Therefore, the equipment has been fully completed.</p>
<p>Changes in Admissions</p>
<p>As for the number of children admitted, it was initially limited to 30 due to funding. However, since the beginning, things have been truly unexpected, as there are only a dozen people so far. After investigation, it was learned that the general working class did not understand the truth and dared not send their children to be entrusted. Now, this school plans to increase the number of children to be cared for. In addition to admitting the children of police officers and low-level civil servants, the children of teachers with monthly salaries of less than 50 yuan will also be admitted in a changed manner. However, the quota is still set at 30, she said.</p>

Attendees included members Mu Jiechu, Huang Renzhi, Lü Yuequan, Zhang Bochun, Jiang Zhuoyun, Gu Wensheng, Pan Hongding, Cao Zhiyuan, and others, totaling approximately five hundred people.

The presidium consisted of Mu Jiechu, Huang Renzhi, Du Yuesheng (represented by Qu ShaoYi), Shen Menglian (represented by Pan Zhiwen), and Lü Yuequan. Cai Diaotu served as the master of ceremonies, with Tang Mengwu and Yu Zhenhui as recorders. After formal ceremonies and a group photo, Executive Director Mu Jiechu gave a report, outlining the association's activities over the past year. He mentioned that a written report was available, but emphasized the necessity of building a new association headquarters. He stressed that a magnificent new building required collective effort and widespread support. Due to a shortage of funds, he appealed for everyone's joint efforts. He concluded by saying that, in these economically challenging times, with a spirit of unity and cooperation, and by promoting the true character of the people of Pudong, success would undoubtedly be achieved. Next, Zhang Bochun, Director of General Affairs, presented a summary of the office's work over the past year. This was followed by Treasurer Chuan Zuoheng's report on the association's financial income and expenditure. Then, Zhang Xiaoliang, Director of the Construction Special Committee, on behalf of architect Xi Fuquan, reported on the progress of the construction. Mao Xiaxuan, representing the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, praising the association's excellent performance and its ability to surpass the Ningbo Native Association, which was highly commendable. General Manager Zeng had said that the organization of native associations was the foundation of the national state.

<h3>Spring Smallpox Prevention: Health Bureau Expands Vaccination</h3>
<p>Starting Today, Beginning with Schools</p>
<p>All Famous Doctors in the City Volunteer to Vaccinate</p>
<p>To prevent smallpox and eradicate infectious diseases, the Municipal Health Bureau has decided to move forward the expanded vaccination campaign, which was originally scheduled to begin on March 1st, to start today. The goal is to achieve the campaign's objectives within March. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Starting Today</p>
<p>The Bureau believes that the weather after spring is unpredictable, and infectious diseases such as smallpox are easily spread. Therefore, it has decided to advance the start date of the health campaign, which was originally scheduled for March 1st, to begin today. The smallpox vaccine has already been distributed by Director Li to the Nanshi Health Office and other locations. The office considers schools the starting point for children's communities and believes they should be given the most attention in health campaigns. Therefore, Director You Jihua has assigned doctors to visit various schools to enforce vaccination.</p>
<p>General Public</p>
<p>At the same time, the general public will also be served by a large number of personnel dispatched by the office, driving vaccination vehicles, starting at 8:30 a.m., to promote vaccination to households and pedestrians on the streets. All costs will be completely free. On the other hand, famous doctors throughout the city, as well as public and private health organizations, have been hired to volunteer to vaccinate, with the goal of preventing the occurrence of infectious diseases among citizens and gradually leading them onto a path of health and well-being within March.</p>
<p>Preventing Cholera</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Bureau is setting up tap water faucets at Longhua Xiaomuqiao Road, Xie Xu Road, and other places to provide citizens with unconditional access, in order to prevent cholera. (It is said that cholera outbreaks occur every four or five years, and medical experts speculate that this year or next year will be the peak.) At the same time, more than ten automatic urinals will be installed in the Nanshi area to ensure cleanliness and hygiene and to prevent the spread of infection.</p>
<h3>News from the South Shanghai Shelter</h3>
<p>There are still more than 2,800 impoverished people being sheltered in the South Shanghai Shelter. They still require about 25 dan (a unit of dry measure) of rice per day. Director Zhang Zixin, due to the recent cold spring, has received numerous requests from the impoverished to continue their stay. Feeling that the funds are insufficient, he has sent a letter to the two committee chairmen requesting prompt relief. Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, two philanthropists, have been running around for days raising funds and have reached an agreement with the South Shanghai Charity Group to continue to provide 2,000 yuan. The Shanghai Drought Relief Association also agreed to discuss allocating funds to assist the shelter during its regular meeting, as the shelter has taken in many drought refugees. After receiving assistance from various parties, Director Zhang will continue to provide shelter to the impoverished and plans to make arrangements to end the shelter when the weather warms up. He has also instructed the administrators to immediately investigate the disabled, elderly, orphans, and impoverished people from other provinces so that they can be sent to disability homes, nursing homes, orphanages, or sent back to their hometowns for relief. It is learned that Director Zhang will be taking leave yesterday, the 24th of this month (Sunday), for the marriage of his second daughter, Ms. Huijuan, to the eldest son of Mr. Zhou Zhenting, a businessman from this city, Yanling Shaojun. The affairs of the shelter will be handled by accountant Tan Qiutian. Important matters will still be reviewed by Director Zhang himself. It is believed that Director Zhang has been dedicated to charitable causes for many years, and the wedding will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Guanghua Medical Journal Society Commemorates the March 17th National Medicine Movement</h3>
<p>The medical journal published by the Guanghua Medical Journal Society at No. 9, Lilong Lane, Beixizhi Road, this city, has now reached Volume 2, Issue 4. The content is rich and valuable to the traditional Chinese medicine community. The current issue's news and research column on Chinese and Japanese medicine contains articles on the study of Japanese traditional Chinese medicine, making the content even more exciting. The society believes that March 17, 1929, was an unprecedented joint movement in the national medical community. It was a request to cancel the proposal to reduce Chinese medicine, which was decided by the Central Health Committee. The struggle resulted in the cancellation of the proposal. However, the National Medical General Federation, which was organized at that time, was soon disbanded, leaving the national traditional Chinese medicine community without a central organization for unity and solidarity. As a result, all plans, programs, and undertakings could not be acted upon due to the lack of an organization, and could not be realized due to the lack of action. In order to encourage the national medical community to be self-aware and make efforts, the society will spread the shame of the March 17th Movement and the dissolution of the National Medical Federation to the minds of people in the national medical community, hoping to encourage them to work hard out of worry, endure humiliation and wipe out shame, and seek the unity of the national medical community again. The society is also soliciting sponsors for the March 17th commemorative issue. The original price is two yuan per year and one yuan per half year, but now it is offered at a 10% discount. There is also a gift for the whole year. This offer is valid from today until April 17th, so that the magazine can be widely promoted to achieve a greater awakening effect.</p>

<h3>Silk and Satin Industry Convenes a General Meeting to Rectify Silver Term Collection Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association believes that the national silk business has been declining in recent years. Furthermore, it has been affected by the economic downturn and tight money supply. As a result, businesses often depreciate, go bankrupt, and are unable to maintain themselves. Recently, debts from various customer groups have been uncertain, causing those with weaker capital to be dragged down and unable to turn around. The association has recognized this and is planning to rectify it. According to the joint request of the association's wholesale merchant members of Hangzhou silk, Huzhou crepe, and Shengjing silk groups to develop effective measures to seek relief, the 10th executive meeting of the association resolved to rectify the silver term and change the collection methods. This year's transactions will be based on cash in principle, and the bill of exchange will be no more than ten days. A temporary general meeting of members will be convened at the Hangzhou Silk Group office in Qianjiang Lane, Ningbo Road, at 1:00 p.m. on the 21st of this month to discuss everything and implement detailed measures. In addition to separately reporting to the party and government agencies and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and sending personnel to guide the meeting, all members will be notified to attend on time and discuss together.</p>

<h3>Water Patrol Team Seizes Red Pills Hidden in a Rowboat</h3>
<p>Lead Skin Inside a Tin Box</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 4 p.m., the water patrol team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched several police officers to patrol the river. When passing the Dadu Wharf on the Bund of Nanshi, they suddenly saw a rowboat carrying more than ten tin boxes, heading towards them. However, the man escorting the boat looked panicked and suspicious. They immediately ordered the boat to stop, jumped on board, and carried out an inspection. They found that the tin boxes all contained a lead skin, and inside the skin, a large number of red pills were secretly hidden (estimated to be worth several thousand yuan). The outside was filled with asphalt to disguise them as oil drums, intending to transport them elsewhere. The man escorting the drugs was detained, and the large number of red pills that were seized were brought back to the team together. Team Captain Wen Yishan questioned him, and then ordered him to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiang Kanghu Speaks on Plain Clothing and Vegetarian Diet</h3>
<p>The Moral Education Lecture Series of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA holds a systematic lecture on the Ten Precepts of Good Life every Sunday. Dr. Jiang Kanghu has been appointed as the lecturer, and Bing Xun Yuanji Du has been specially appointed by Dr. Jiang as the recorder. Yesterday's first lecture was on plain clothing and vegetarian diet. The original text of plain clothing is "Clothes of coarse cloth, the true color of a scholar. Although brocade and embroidery are gorgeous, life is to be cherished. Fur coats should be retired, replaced with wool. Using glue from beams, why use leather? Extravagance in the country, urgent need for moderation." In ten sentences, Dr. Jiang said that merchants in previous dynasties in China all wore cloth clothes, but only when scholars entered the court did they wear silk clothes, unlike the unlimited restrictions today. China used to be a silk market, but now it has been almost completely occupied by artificial silk. I sincerely hope that domestic industrialists will pay attention to this and add artificial silk factories to recover their rights. As for the preciousness of leather life, it is best not to use it again. The original text of vegetarian food is "Living beings on knives and boards fill my mouth and stomach. A person without benevolence is a barbaric custom. Moreover, for hygiene, there is misfortune and no blessing. Why not eat vegetarian food, clean and far from poison? Biting the vegetable roots, the fragrance is full." In ten sentences, Dr. Jiang said that meat and fish are harmful and unhelpful, and they kill small lives. Morally, it is also cruel. Vegetarianism is both hygienic and thrifty, but it is also inconvenient to specialize in vegetarianism. It is better to be flexible from time to time. I hope that the audience will make up their minds.</p>

<h3>New Initiative of Sichuan Stores</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Store on Nanjing Road (near Shanxi Road) in this city, opened by Sichuanese, has long been known for specializing in Sichuan white fungus. Although the city's economy was sluggish last year, the store's operations still progressed, which was due to its superior white fungus. Recently, the store owner heard that a portion of the Sichuan white fungus production area, previously occupied by communist bandits, has now been recovered. They have dispatched specialists to reorganize it and plan to significantly increase production, with the aim of further reducing costs, so that customers who have regularly consumed the store's white fungus over the years can enjoy cheaper goods this year. This is easy for the store since it has its own white fungus farms and has unique experience in management.

<p>Xinhua Bank Offers Rental Property Referral Services</p>
<p>A Shortcut to Solving Housing Problems</p>
<p>Housing is a very serious problem in Shanghai. Those with houses to rent cannot easily find suitable tenants, and those who need housing have difficulty finding suitable houses. Both supply and demand are facing difficulties. There is also a lack of rental property referral agencies in the market to serve both parties. In view of this, the Fourth Office of Xinhua Bank, located at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Vallon, has created a rental property referral service to provide free referral services for those renting out and seeking housing in the French Concession area. No fees will be charged. Anyone with housing to rent or in need of housing can contact the bank for registration, and they will be happy to provide referrals. This can be called good news for residents in the French Concession area.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Ma Xiangbo, he read a news item in the "Local News" column of the February 16th Shen Bao regarding the settlement of the Li Shilin lawsuit against Shangxian Hall, which stated, "The apology advertisement fee was donated by Xiong Xiling and others." He was very surprised to read this. The advertisement in this case was published by Xiangbo as a mediator, stating that it was to clarify misunderstandings between the two parties, and there were no words or meaning of apology to either party. There were absolutely no words of apology in the letters from Mr. Xiong and Mr. Zhu, and Li Shilin did not fundamentally require an apology either. The Shen Bao also published this advertisement on the same day. The words "apology" violated the original intention. I hereby send this letter, hoping that it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column to avoid confusion. Sincerely, Tan Yigong, Lawyer, February 17th.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Metaphysical Talk</h3>
<p>— Missing the Boat</p>
<p>I remember reading a book attributed to Dongfang Shuo called "The Classic of Strange Things," which talked about a strange creature in the world called the "Veracious Beast." Its meat is very delicious, but people who eat it risk not telling the truth. Whether there is such a creature in the world, I have no interest in researching; whether people's untruthfulness is due to eating this creature, I have no way of knowing. But the untruthfulness of people is a well-known fact. I must declare that I am a member of the crowd, and since people speak untruthfully, I cannot be an exception. Although I have never eaten a Veracious Beast, I know that most of what I say is not true. Those "gentlemen" in "high hats and wide sleeves" who think they tell the truth should not bother to teach me. I must also declare that I believe a well-intentioned blessing may not be well-intentioned, and a mad curse may not be malicious. A monk bowing all the way is only showing hypocrisy and is hateful. On the other hand, a shrew scolding in the street has enthusiasm and should not be deeply criticized. Therefore, instead of hypocritically blessing people, I would rather vehemently scold them, because well-intentioned blessings are the business of religious people, not mine. Those who hope for well-intentioned blessings should angrily leave. I must also declare that I am breathing in the crowd, and I am no different from other people. All that is special is that I lack the advantages that the crowd considers virtues, and I have all the disadvantages that the crowd considers faults. From a certain point of view, I should be scolded, not others. However, on my part, I only see the faults of others and not my own. This, I must say, is a common fault of mankind. I can forgive myself; whether others forgive me, I cannot control. A person should be true to himself rather than to others. If one cannot be true to oneself, then being true to others is a matter of pity, and the heart can be forgiven.</p>
<p>However, the world is outwardly advising people not to be true to themselves but to be true to others; inwardly, they are all excessively true to themselves and absolutely untrue to others. This is because, after eating the Veracious Beast, the degree of untruthfulness has reached the point of "consummate skill." However, in my opinion, this absolute inward loyalty to oneself and outward "hypocrisy" in advising people to be loyal to others is somewhat unpleasant. It is better to be honestly true to oneself both outwardly and inwardly. This kind of revelation of facts may not be as pure in its untruthfulness as those whose outward and inward selves are inconsistent. This may be due to "even the wise make mistakes." The ancients have said it before me. Whether I am wise, I must let others judge. Whether the judgment is good or bad, I will ignore it, because I already know the untruthfulness of others. My so-called wisdom is your so-called unwisdom, and your so-called unwisdom may be my so-called wisdom. You will naturally show me the standard, you will naturally show me the classics, you will naturally show me the ruler, and finally you will even show me the mummy. But this is useless. I will also show you the standard, show you the classics, show you the ruler, and finally I will even show you the mummy. Therefore, your magic weapon, your barbarian head, your mask, your invisibility cloak, can only be played in front of those who do not know how to use magic weapons, do not sell barbarian heads, do not wear masks, and do not wear invisibility cloaks, and cannot be played in front of those who know how to use magic weapons, sell barbarian heads, wear masks, and wear invisibility cloaks. If you bring out your magic weapon, we have to match spells. As a result of matching spells, if you show your fox tail, you are not worthy of speaking untruthfully in a grand manner; if I show my fox tail, I am not worthy of speaking untruthfully in a grand manner. If we are evenly matched, we bow to each other and retreat to our respective places. This is naturally the most appropriate method, because everyone can hide their tails and avoid being embarrassed. If both sides are injured, it is tasteless for everyone. But human nature likes to hide their own tails and wants to see other people's tails. This is inevitable that a Wang Daoshi catching a demon will not catch the demon but will be thrown with a head full of manure by the demon.</p>
<p>This is called "self-inflicted misery!" Human nature is like this, what can be done?</p>
<h3>A Hope Before Spring</h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>Spring seems to have already arrived. The significant spring tide in early February brought news of spring. The term "spring tide" is rich in symbolic meaning in our hearts. Although the spring tide transmitted from Western literature refers to the spring floods after melting, we, residents on the western coast of the ocean, also receive spring messages from the sea tide. We can mix them up.</p>
<p>In the Jian Yin calendar, which also uses the tropical year standard, spring does indeed begin in early February (that is, with the Beginning of Spring as the starting point). However, in the current Gregorian calendar, the starting point of spring is at the Spring Equinox. We are still two solar terms away from spring. But we don't need to blame the tide's lack of faith based on the Gregorian calendar; it ultimately tells us to prepare and wait for spring's arrival. We can foresee the coming of a good era, which is much more comforting than just feeling its vastness.</p>
<p>Earlier and more noticeable than any other signs of spring is this spring tide. The island doesn't sing, the flowers don't bloom, and even the leaves don't have yellow edges, but we would believe it's because of spring, perhaps because of the tide. The tide has a natural relationship with the moon. Our customary spring, not strictly speaking, begins with the Beginning of Spring, but generally begins with the first month of the lunar calendar. Thinking about the relationship between the moon and the tide, we can say it's because there is a significant sign. We cannot see or perhaps even directly feel the tide and the moon on New Year's Day and the days that follow. But during the Lantern Festival, both give us information together, which is deeply encouraging. The moon is full more than a dozen times every year, but only the full moons of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Lantern Festival are regarded as festivals by us. The reason why the Mid-Autumn Moon is noticed is familiar to everyone. The Lantern Festival moon brings news of spring. According to old customs, this day of the Lantern Festival is aptly called "Hope of Spring."</p>
<p>"Hope of Spring" is not only noticed by people who are accustomed to using the lunar calendar. Westerners who have used the solar calendar for a long time still pay attention to "Hope of Spring" every year. It is based on "Hope of Spring" as the standard. In fact, rather than calling it Foreign Qingming, we should call it Foreign Shangsi (the third day of the third lunar month), because the Qingming solar term is set according to the tropical year standard and is fixed on the solar calendar, with a large difference from the movement of Easter. However, compared with the lunar calendar, Easter must be the Sunday after the full moon around the third day of the third lunar month, and it will not differ by more than a week.</p>
<p>The attention to Easter seems to be due to religious ceremonies, but just as the Chinese Qingming is nominally for tomb sweeping, it is actually to encourage spring outings. Looking at the way the general public celebrates Easter, we can also see that this true meaning is tacitly understood by everyone.</p>
<p>The foreign moon is completely ignored by the general public—that is, except for navigators and astronomers—so they calculate Easter by first determining the full moon after the Spring Equinox. In today's and future days when our lunar calendar has been abolished, to know the Lantern Festival, we probably have to seek it from Easter. That's very simple. Slightly change the Western custom of taking the full moon after spring as "Hope of Spring." We take the full moon within fifteen days before and after the Spring Equinox (March 6 to April 4) as "Hope of Spring." The full moon one month before this "Hope" is the Lantern Festival. To express its current meaning, it can also be called "Hope Before Spring."</p>
<p>In terms of the actual pleasantness of sightseeing, more can indeed be gained during "Hope of Spring." Westerners must put this "Hope" after the Spring Equinox, precisely for this reason. But to express the joy of feeling the coming of spring, it is more appropriate to do so during "Hope Before Spring." Therefore, there is a reason why we paid attention to the Lantern Festival in the past. We don't need to think of the moon from spring; we explore the future of spring from the moon. People have always regarded the moon as arousing people's emotions of sadness and nostalgia, but at least the Lantern Festival moon rarely has this meaning. It is just like the spring tide it brings, pushing forward infinite hope.</p>
<p>Of course, as expressed in Zhu Shuzhen's (?) poem, thinking of "not seeing last year's person" while looking at the Lantern Festival moon, and thus "tears mixed with silk sleeves" is also completely sentimental and nostalgic. But we cannot only look at this half of the poem. Try to think of the interesting realm of "last year's Lantern Festival night," when "the moon rose on the willow tips, and people met after dusk." This is also inspired by the bright moon of spring. If it were a perfect flower and a full moon, the Lantern Festival moon would naturally leave behind complete joy. Moreover, even the sadness in the second half of the poem is shedding tears at the joyous scene, rather than increasing sadness in the face of a bleak scene. The Lantern Festival moon is still ultimately exciting.</p>
<p>Being able to look at the moon with apology while still being pervaded by the piercing cold wind is also one aspect of the great human spirit. The spring tide is indeed trustworthy, and spring is surely coming. Since this belief will not change, we will of course feel happy. Let us raise our glasses and ask the blue sky during this "Hope Before" spring.</p>
<h3>The Charm of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>Last night, while sleeping, I unconsciously thought of many old things in Beiping.</p>
<p>I have been away from Beiping for six or seven years. I have never thought about it. When I lived in Beiping, I didn't feel particularly interested. I don't know why I couldn't sleep in bed last night, but I thought of many of its good points. Perhaps this is the same as being in love. When two people meet every day, holding hands and chatting, they don't feel anything special at the time. But once they are separated, not seeing each other for ten or eight years, suddenly one day they think of the time when they held hands and chatted, they realize that holding hands at that time was really rare, really full of mystery, and a feeling of something like, but not quite, regret stirs in their heart. I probably feel the same way about Beiping.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a friend came to talk, and we talked until late at night. When I sent him out the front door, the sky was full of stars. The Milky Way was very low, and the stars in the sky seemed as if you could pick them off with a raise of your hand. Everything around was very quiet. When I opened the door, the neighbor's dog barked a few times, and just in time the lights in the alley went out. I could only see a dim yellow light outside the street, but the alley was exceptionally dark. At this moment, I suddenly thought of the alleys of Beiping. If I could hear a clapper sound again in this place, I would forget that I am in Tianjin.</p>
<p>In Tianjin, it is difficult to make people pay attention to the changes of the seasons. At most, it is just changing from cotton clothes to lined clothes, and from lined clothes to single shirts. But in Beiping, it is not like that. The alleys of Beiping fully express the differences of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In spring, small whirlwinds are most likely to rise in the alleys. A thin layer of soil rolls up with willow catkins, extraordinarily rich in poetic charm. When it rains lightly, it is not easy for people to walk in the alleys. It is best not to go out if there is nothing to do. Buy a few cents' worth of shaojiu, buy a pack of peanuts to eat, and sit at home listening to the vendors at the door shouting to sell green vegetables and grapes. It is another kind of charm. When spring turns to early summer, there are vendors selling green apricots, selling cherries and mulberries, and selling various flowers. Especially after the rain, the flowers are even more vibrant. Coupled with the artistic voice of the flower vendors, a trembling sound: "Buy a twig of peach bamboo, a pomegranate flower!" It really reminds people of Lu You's famous line: "I heard the spring rain in the small building last night, and there are people selling apricot blossoms in the deep alley tomorrow morning." In summer, when people are sweating from the heat, at noon there are children selling ice kernels (pronounced hu), carrying two pieces of ice, shouting: "Ice kernels are here, ice kernels are here!" while running out of the alley like flying, because selling ice requires running. If they were as refined as the flower vendors, they would not be able to sell many customers, and the ice would melt completely. This is also a kind of interesting business, because selling ice doesn't earn much money, and in the summer at noon, they still have to carry the ice and run quickly. In our view, it is certainly very torturous, but the children think that running and playing is fun enough.</p>
<p>When autumn comes, it is more likely to rain. After a few rains, the leaves on the trees almost fall off with the rain. The withered yellow leaves roll around in the alleys in a mess. If a poet wants to "seek the path of yellow leaves alone," there is no need to go to some suburban area. In the alleys of Beiping, you can have this kind of charm. With a rustling sound of yellow leaves, the vendors selling corn kernels and cool fried beans come. There are also vendors selling newly fallen peanuts. These kinds of vendors' voices are no different from telling people, "Prepare your cotton robes." As expected, autumn passes quickly. I remember that Mr. Lu Xun seemed to have said that Beiping has no spring and autumn, which makes a lot of sense. If winter is prolonged and summer is brought forward, this spring is crossed over invisibly. If winter is brought forward and summer is prolonged, autumn is also very short. Although this is the case, the vendors in Beiping are never wrong about the seasons.</p>
<p>The winter in Beiping can even more make people appreciate a special taste. Now almost every household has installed Western stoves, but in the past, there were no Western stoves, only small white stoves. If it is dusk with dark clouds threatening snow, there is no need to turn on the lights in the room. The coal briquettes in the small white stove are red, which can illuminate people's beards and eyebrows. The room is filled with faint red light. The thin window paper makes a rustling sound, followed by the wind door being blown open by the wind and then closing with a "bang." This special charm was not noticed much at the time, but a few of our friends were roasting their hands around the stove, some holding teapots in their hands, writing poetry. Probably no one had that kind of leisurely mood. Playing a game of Go could make people forget the cold, or else they would get into the big cotton quilt early, lying down to read books and smoke cigarettes. At this time, they don't know if it is snowing outside, and they pay even less attention to the wind outside. However, in a very, very far place, a sharp tune of "Rang! Bu Lai—Sai Li" is blown by the wind, and sometimes it even forms a harmony with the whistle of the train. At this time, the mood of us lying in the quilt is really unknown. Regretful, no; sad, even less so; happy, not at all. It's just that our heart is empty, feeling a bit confused, beyond the seven emotions of love, hate, desire, so there is no way to describe what kind of taste it was at that time.</p>
<p>The next thing is that I appreciate the irregular beauty of the alleys of Beiping. For example, next to a big red gate, there may be a small black gate, and inside the small black gate, there may be two big jujube trees. The alleys are all winding and twisting. For example, Dog Tail Alley really bends like a dog's tail. Although there are no iron lions in Iron Lion Alley, there is a pair of stone lions. The names of the alleys in Beiping are probably true to their names, but Tianjin is not like that. No matter the size of the neighborhood, it is named after virtue or righteousness. For example, Chongde Lane, but the people in this neighborhood may not really advocate virtue. The houses are all in the same form, arranged densely like pigeon cages, which makes people feel unpleasant when they see them.</p>
<p>What also interests me is the lantern riddles and storytelling in the alleys of Beiping. Every night, many literati and bored intellectuals gather under the corners of the walls, staring intently at the white paper strips on the lanterns. If they guess correctly, they may have the hope of getting two small packages of tea, but no one hopes for this trifle. The most important thing is the issue of interest. If they fail to guess three times, they will purse their lips and feel a little disappointed. I haven't been to the storytelling place for more than ten years. When I see Liu Jingting's storytelling in The Peach Blossom Fan, I always think of the storyteller's expression when he claps the awakening wood. If I go to this kind of public entertainment place now, it will definitely make me think of many social issues. However, these have all left me far, far away!</p>
<h3>Crossing the Banjarmasin River Again</h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>The day after returning from Daqu, in the afternoon, I crossed the Banjarmasin River again.</p>
<p>Taking the small steamer of ×× Company, I didn't have to be subject to the control of the tide, and the boat was driven straight towards the opposite bank. The rushing tide was impacted by the mechanical force, and from time to time sprayed up quite a bit of spray. Some small Malay boats could not withstand the impact of the rushing tide, and constantly swayed their small boats on the waves. The Malays used strong arms and skilled boat handling techniques, and from time to time followed the ups and downs of the waves, slowly floating the boat from the cross section of the small steamer.</p>
<p>The sun shone out from behind Banjarmasin Port, flashing gold on the muddy river water. Looking back, Banjarmasin Port slowly shrank between the green clusters, like a fade-in of a movie scene.</p>
<p>The boat stopped at the pier on the opposite bank of Banjarmasin, and a group of Malays swarmed in to seize and grab the passengers' luggage. Mr. Shen's son was so frightened that he grabbed his small leather suitcase tightly and shouted angrily. When he realized that this was just a prank by a group of idle Malay youths, he smiled timidly.</p>
<p>In front of a small white iron-roofed house on the shore, a car stood alone. There were no houses around, and the scorching sunlight steamed up thick dust on the road lying in front of us.</p>
<p>The car started, and we rushed into the small place belonging to Banjarmasin.</p>
<h3>Gold Nine's Father (Continued)</h3>

<p>One morning when Gold Nine's Father went out, she found a pool of bright red blood on the ground in front of the stove. It was so thick that it seemed to have blood clots. She covered it with paper, enduring the heartbeat.</p>
<p>Gold Nine's Father's choking cough slowly became denser, and his eyes were ashen as if his soul had been frightened away. The flesh of his eyes and cheeks sank. The child grasped his father's wrist, comparing it innocently:</p>
<p>"Father's arm is as thick as Jiu's!"</p>
<p>The other one just laughed with a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The woman gave the only pair of silver bracelets to the man for a medical treatment.</p>
<p>"You have to rest," the doctor looked at the faces of the couple from behind his wire-rimmed glasses. Even the patient's pale skin now showed a hint of red, as if scolding this method of treatment. The husband then changed his words:</p>
<p>"Otherwise, eat a few chickens, stewed in plain water, just drink the soup."</p>
<p>Helping the patient back home, both of them were stunned.</p>
<p>"Rest, easier said than done. Are we all going to starve? Live for one day and count one day!" The man said through clenched teeth, and the next day he went out again, reading indistinctly, with a pair of carrying poles swaying back and forth. Gold Nine's Father still sang in a hoarse voice under the blue cloth circle. During this time, he also coughed up a few mouthfuls of blood, and then stamped on it with his foot.</p>
<p>The woman there was busy waiting to buy small chicks.</p>
<p>After two days of worrying, she managed to buy a pair. The yellow down covered their backs. The woman took care of them as carefully as she took care of Jiu, afraid that the children in the neighborhood would step on them or that wild cats would carry them away, and she kept them under a bamboo woven cover.</p>
<p>Every day, the woman used the few large coins she had saved from the cellophane candy box to buy some sorghum to feed the chicks. Seeing them gradually resemble adult chickens, she was happy, but when she saw the man's condition getting worse, she hated that the chicks were growing too slowly.</p>
<p>The chicks were growing after all, and their appetite increased. The few handfuls of sorghum that were put down every day were quickly pecked away. The woman could not find more money to buy sorghum.</p>
<p>Until the day when Gold Nine's Father could no longer hold on—the day when he only had a few breaths left under his navel—the two chicks were so hungry that they were about to stop breathing.</p>
<p>The man and the chickens were each struggling with their own limited lives.</p>

<h3>Shigaota Cup Semifinals Fiercely Fought for Two Hours, Exhausted, Tung Wah and Laox Keis End in Draw</h3>
<p>Result: 2-2, No Winner Decided</p>
<p>Extra Time Still Ends in Tie</p>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai Weiyuan's Shigaota Cup Semifinals, Tung Wah and Laox Keis were unexpectedly engaged in an unprecedented fierce battle, fighting bitterly for two hours, but ultimately failed to decide a winner, ending in a 2-2 draw. In the first half, Tung Wah scored two consecutive goals, while Laox Keis also scored one goal, giving Tung Wah a 2-1 lead. In the second half, Laox Keis scored a penalty kick, while Tung Wah gained nothing. By the end of the game, it was a 2-2 draw. Referee Li Nuosi, based on the cup match semi-final rule that a draw must go to extra time, extended the game for thirty minutes, but the score remained 2-2, so he declared the game stopped. The replay will be held approximately next Saturday. Except for a defeat to Beining this season, this battle was the first bitter fight for Tung Wah, causing 8,000 fans to be intoxicated and restless. The starting lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Equally Matched, Closely Contested</p>
<p>Tung Wah's central defense line was inevitably affected by Chen Hongguang's stay in Hong Kong. Ding Zhaocheng has done his best, but his experience seems insufficient. Xiao Dai has been away from the battlefield for a long time, and his former sharpness has not yet been restored yesterday, accomplishing nothing. The golden age of Wan Xianghua has passed. Looking back at Laox Keis, all are young men who can run and exert themselves. Except for the relatively weak Logan Greiff, Kirkham made many saves. Among the forwards, Bowserley is the best, taking care of both offense and defense, and making great contributions. Attige (formerly written as Arger) frequently made wonderful plays, which were well-received. It is a pity that the five forwards had poor communication, otherwise Tung Wah would have been even more troubled. Therefore, yesterday's battle was equally matched. The tension in the air did not allow the spectators to sit still.</p>
<p>Each Side Presents Thrills</p>
<p>Laox Keis kicked off first. Tung Wah intercepted the ball and counterattacked. Feng Yunyou passed to Li Yichen. Li fired at the goal, but unexpectedly it flew into the sky. Laox Keis also came, Simmons passed to Riyimeda, already in front of the goal, but fortunately Li Ning rushed forward and retreated. The ball was passed from Jia Youliang to Logan who rushed to save it. Although Li Yichen shot fiercely and scored, it was disallowed because Li illegally bumped into a person. Attige shot from far away, and Lu Zhongen punched it back to the midfield. Jia Youliang passed through Logan, passing to the center. Dai Linjing rushed to head the ball, thinking it would definitely go in, but unexpectedly it bounced down from the crossbar. Li Yichen missed his footing and failed to score, which was a great pity.</p>
<p>If It Doesn't Go In, It Doesn't Go In. If It Goes In, It Goes In Twice</p>
<p>The two sides were in a stalemate, frequently going back and forth. At the 15-minute mark, this tense situation changed with Li Yichen's kick. Laox Keis's left defense was empty. Jia Youliang was as if he had entered an uninhabited land. Chen Jiaqiu brought the ball and passed it to Jia. Jia darted deep, and then passed it to Jiaqiu again. Logan wanted to save it but still lost his footing. Li Yichen benefited as a fisherman, scoring with one kick. Cheers rose from all directions. As one wave subsided, another rose. Within two minutes, Tung Wah repeated the same trick, scoring again. Jia Youliang took advantage of the situation and broke in from the right. Jia passed the ball to the center again. Li Yichen sent it in with a bang. Laox Keis stared blankly, not knowing what to do, which was also unexpected.</p>
<p>Meda Strikes Back to Recover a Goal</p>
<p>The tense situation gradually eased from this point on. Laox Keis repeatedly counterattacked, failing by a narrow margin. Kirkham shot fiercely, and the ball happened to fall into Lu Zhongen's hands. The Meda brothers frequently sent wonderful balls, but it was a pity that no one received them. Bowserley approached, and A Guan picked up the ball for a corner kick. Attige kicked it in wonderfully, but Li Da's high ball flew into the sky. In the last ten minutes of the first half, Greiff intercepted Ding Zhaocheng's ball and passed it to Attige. Attige's feet flew, sending it to the middle. Riyimeda kicked a low ball, and Lu Zhongen, being tall, found it difficult to bend down. It had already entered the net. Although Laox Keis continued to counterattack, the first half ended with Tung Wah leading 2-1.</p>
<p>A Guan Blunders, Penalty Kick</p>
<p>Switching sides, the second contact was only five minutes in when Tung Wah suddenly suffered a disaster, being penalized for a penalty kick. T Mai attacked from the right, the ball was passed to the center. Li Ning was about to kick it out when Guan Xun'an carelessly pushed the opponent's player in the back. Li Nuosi's cold eyes had already caught sight of it. Although Lu Zhongen questioned him, it was still Laox Keis's Kirkham who took the kick. The ball rolled to the left. Lu Zhongen dived horizontally, but failed to catch it firmly. Kirkham rushed up and added another kick, and it rolled into the net. The audience roared, expressing dissatisfaction for Tung Wah. However, the result of the argument was 2-2, no doubt. Laox Keis's momentum greatly increased after this goal, charging left and right. Tung Wah was in a precarious situation, with all sorts of dangers emerging, and everyone was shouting for Tung Wah. The generals struggled valiantly, barely maintaining the end of the game.</p>
<p>Extra Time Still Ends in Draw</p>
<p>Cup match semi-finals, a draw must go to extra time. The referee blew the whistle to restart the game. The Tung Wah players were exhausted and unwilling to fight. There were also some people who encouraged them, but limited by the rules, they still lined up and continued. Tung Wah kicked off, Gu Shangxiang first sent a high ball out of the field, Wan Xianghua shot and missed again. Feng Yunyou fired a heavy cannon in the back, which was saved by the goalkeeper again. Tung Wah's luck was not good, and there was nothing to be done. Laox Keis also had a counterattack, Meda's low ball, Lu Zhongen got it and lost it again. Attige rushed up, but was a little late and failed to score. After switching sides, Dai Linjing shot powerfully at the goal in the crowd. It was extremely heavy, and it was able to fall into Kirkham's hands, which was also Laox Keis's luck.</p>

<h3>Newly Invented Bakelite Whistle: A Useful Tool for Instructors, Referees and Physical Education Teachers</h3>
<p>Whistles are essential for sports, military and police circles. Ordinary iron ones are prone to discoloration and unhygienic after prolonged use. The Pubian Electrical Hardware Factory at No. 56, Sanzai Lane, Jingxiu Road, Ximen in this city, recognizing this, created a Bakelite whistle last year. Since its self-marketing, it has been very popular among sports, military and police circles. Its style is very novel and its color is very beautiful. The major difference from ordinary products is that it requires little effort to blow, while the sound is loud and accurate. Also it is sanitary, durable, etc.. Therefore, sports teachers, sports referees, and military and police instructors who want to achieve great results and save energy should adopt this Bakelite whistle. It is said that the factory is planning to mass-produce this year and reduce the selling price to promote sales. Sports goods companies such as Sincere and Wing On sports departments, New World hardware department, Central, Standard, Lianchangji, Huadong, Qianghua, Shichang, and Guoguang, brother stores, scientific instrument halls, Yixin educational supplies, Dadong Qixin, Dazhong, Bolan, and Qinfen bookstores are all retailers. Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company and its branches are the special managers.</p>

<h3>The Geological Society of China Concludes: New Discoveries by Ding Wenjiang and Yang Jie; China's Total Iron Ore Production is Over 100 Billion Tons; Japan Needs More Than 2 Million Tons of Iron Ore from China Annually</h3>
<p>Weng Wenhao's Important Speech at the Annual Meeting</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) The Geological Society of China held meetings in Peiping for several days, creating an atmosphere of scientific research in Peiping's academic circles. The society read papers in the afternoons of the past two days (15th and 16th). Yesterday morning, Dr. Weng Wenhao gave a lecture at Peking University on "An Overview of China's Coal, Oil, Iron, and Aluminum Resources," which contained many valuable statistical materials. This morning, members visited the newly built classrooms of the Geology Department of Peking University and the exhibition hall of the Geological Survey Institute, each making notes and discussions. In the evening, all members held a dinner party at the Overseas Students' Association, awarded the Grabau Medal, and announced the closing. Details of each aspect are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Weng Wenhao's Lecture</p>
<p>Weng Wenhao gave a lecture on "An Overview of China's Coal, Oil, Iron, and Aluminum Resources" at Peking University at 10 AM on the 15th. He said: "Today, I will talk about China's mineral resources. The Geological Survey Institute previously published a book, 'China's Iron Ore,' authored by Ding Gelan. However, the completion of this book was not solely due to Ding's efforts; all colleagues at the Geological Survey Institute contributed. The book states that China's iron ore production is 9.51 million tons, a very small number. If the United States continues to mine at its current rate, it may be depleted in just a few years. Of this iron ore, three-quarters is in the Liaoning area, and one-quarter is in the areas of Chahar, Zunhua, Xuanhua, and Longguan. The central government once recruited merchants to jointly establish the Longyan Company to mine it and built a large iron smelting furnace in Xishan. However, the result was that the shareholders had different opinions and failed to produce iron. At the same time, Britain discovered similar iron ore and established the Tata Ironworks to mine it, producing 1.2 million tons of iron annually. In addition, iron ore is also found along the Yangtze River, including Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. Every year, 2 million tons of iron sand are transported to Japan. The Hubei Hankou Yeping Iron Mine was founded by Zhang Zhidong and others, and a contract was signed with Japan to supply 1 million tons of iron sand annually. This contract still exists. Anhui's iron ore production is also very abundant and has attracted the attention of Japan. A contract was also signed to supply 1 million tons of iron sand annually. In addition, Japan has also signed a contract with the Malay Peninsula to supply 500,000 tons of iron ore annually. Although China's iron ore seems exhausted, new surveys have revealed that many provinces not listed above have more. (1) Iron ore within the borders of Pingxiang County, Jiangxi, can produce 2 million tons; iron ore within the borders of Yongxin County can produce 1 million tons. (2) Xuandu, Hubei, can produce 4 million tons. (3) Ningxiang, Chaling, Anhua, Yuanling, and Huadi in Hunan also have iron ore. The total for the above provinces is 25 million tons. (4) Luanping and Longhua in Jehol Province can produce 15 million tons. (5) Baiyungebao in Suiyuan Province can produce 10 million tons. The total for the above provinces is 15 million tons. The national total is estimated at 100 billion tons. Regarding aluminum ore, most of China's aluminum products are foreign goods, but China also has several aluminum ore deposits, and the amount is not small. This aluminum can be divided into two categories: (1) Bauxite ore, in the area of Liuchuan and Boshan, Shandong, has been surveyed to produce 270 billion tons. However, the composition is very mixed, and Bauxite accounts for less than one-tenth. (2) Mingli in Pingyang, Zhejiang, is currently surveyed to produce 200,000 tons, with only 35% pure stone. In addition, there is also a mine in Hujiang, Anhui, which can produce 17 billion tons."</p>
<p>Russian Basin</p>
<p>Ding Wenjiang presented a paper on "The Stratigraphy of the Donets Basin in Russia," the main points of which are as follows: "Grabau considers the Donets Basin to be Permian, while the Moscow series is considered to be Middle Carboniferous, with the lower part being the Langa series. I collected foraminifera fossils in Russia for comparative study. Li Siguang studied the foraminifera stratification. Russian scholars believe that the fossils have a 'discontinuity,' which is not entirely true. Therefore, it is necessary to divide Grabau's Donets series into upper and lower halves."</p>
<p>Important Discussion</p>
<p>After Ding Wenjiang presented his paper, Grabau discussed it, saying: "I am very pleased that Chinese geologists have collected materials in Russia and brought them back to China, where Chinese paleontologists have studied them and achieved good results. My previous divisions were based on publications in the Russian geological community. Recently, two papers were published by Russian geologists Likharev and Vored at the Geological Society of China, and their opinions are quite different. If foraminifera are reliable stratigraphic fossils, then I very much agree with Dr. Ding Wenjiang's opinion."</p>
<h3>World-Renowned Geologist, Professor Grabau of Peking University</h3>
<p>Strange Fossil</p>
<p>In addition to presenting a paper on "Contact Metamorphism around the Yangfang Granite in the Western Hills of Peiping" on the first day of the meeting, Yang Jie also read a second paper today (the 16th) on "Conical Tubular Fossils in the Metamorphosed Limestone in the Southern Part of the Southern Peak of Mount Wutai, Shanxi." The key points of his new discovery are as follows: "China's Precambrian strata are now divided into three major periods: the Taishan System, the Wutai System, and the Sinian System. The Taishan System is composed of granite gneiss, the Wutai System is composed of schistose rocks, mostly transformed from sedimentary rocks, and the Sinian System is mostly composed of sedimentary rocks. Of course, there will be no biological remains in the granite gneiss, and there should be no fossils in the metamorphic rocks of the Wutai System. Last year, the author discovered fossils similar to Collenia in the metamorphosed limestone near Longdi Village, south of the Southern Peak, but they are thinner and longer than this object, so they should belong to the Gymnosolen class. This class has been found in the Cambrian and Ordovician strata in Canada, Sweden, and the Arctic regions. However, the southern part of the Southern Peak is definitely part of the Wutai System, and this system has never had any biological remains discovered, so this is a point that we should pay attention to."</p>
<p>Awarding Medals</p>
<p>At 9 PM tonight, it was announced that this year's Grabau Medal recipients are Ding Wenjiang and Teilhard de Chardin. Grabau presented the gold medals to Ding and Teilhard. The medal was initiated in 1925 by the President of the Society, Wang Longyou, and awarded by the Geological Society of China as a gold medal, named the Grabau Medal in permanent commemoration of his teacher, Dr. Grabau. Wang donated 600 yuan to cover the cost of casting the first medal, and the rest was used as a permanent fund for the medal. The first medal was awarded to Grabau. The seven rules were established, and the Geological Society's Council meeting on March 8, 1926, approved the implementation. The second committee of the medal committee should (in order of stroke count) be Ding Wenjiang, Wu Chongbu, Li Siguang, Zhang Hongzhao, Weng Wenhao, and Grabau, according to Article 3 of the medal rules.

<h3>How to Popularize Scientific Medicine in China (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Yu Yunxiu, recorded by Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>After seeing the facts mentioned above, we clearly recognize that people without scientific minds do not care about reasoning. They only know that if a doctor can cure their illness, that doctor has real skills and power. The distinction between human barbarism and civilization lies in the ability to analyze things; the distinction between science and non-science lies in the accuracy of analysis. People without scientific minds and semi-civilized people only know the resultant force in physics but not its component forces; they only recognize compounds in chemistry but not their components. Therefore, they often mistake complex phenomena as simple principles. They only see that traditional Chinese medicine sometimes cures illnesses and then say that Chinese medicine has its reasons, without pursuing how the illness was cured, where the "Tao" is, and where the principles are. Therefore, even if we actively promote the rhetoric of medical revolution, they turn a deaf ear and are unwilling to accept it, which is absolutely ineffective. I just heard a speech advocating that to popularize scientific medicine, we must go to the people! While this is a fundamental issue in popularizing scientific medicine, I believe we should also go to the government! By "going to the government," I don't mean becoming officials, but that we should adopt Song Yan's method of "teaching from above" and persuade those in power to understand science. If everyone in power can awaken and support the cause of scientific medicine in China, with the effect of "what the superiors do, the inferiors will follow" and using political power to reform medicine, then popularizing scientific medicine in China can be achieved quickly and easily. I believe that the popularization of scientific medicine in China cannot be solved without using political power. If we do grassroots work and publicize among the people, who knows if any effects will be seen in a hundred or a thousand years!</p>
<p>Just now, a classmate said, "Traditional medicine must be sacrificed painfully and abolished"! I agree with this statement, and I think it is the most reasonable thing to do. I remember Mr. Wu Zhihui once said to me, "National essence is smelly! It's not too late to talk about it in thirty or forty years; now, we should put it aside." Although Mr. Wu's words were not about medicine, I believe they should be applied to traditional Chinese medicine as well.</p>
<p>Some people say that Chinese medicinal materials are effective and worthy of praise. That is true, but we must recognize that "study is not medicine" and "medicine is not study." Modern study cannot escape the scope of science. Darwin's philosophy is based on the study of biology. Therefore, when talking about "medicine and drugs," we must also base it on science. In other words, a person who knows how to use drugs is not necessarily knowledgeable in medicine. Animals without knowledge can also use drugs. I remember that Volume 120 of the "Taiping Guangji," Medical Category, says, "A tiger hit by a poisoned arrow eats Qingni; a wild boar hit by a poisoned arrow eats shepherd's purse; a pheasant injured by a fawn applies rehmannia leaves to it. Moreover, alum can harm rats; Zhang Jing once tested it; the rat, poisoned as if drunk, does not recognize people, yet knows to take mud and drink it, and recovers shortly." According to this, even rats know how to use drugs. Does that mean they understand pharmacology? Furthermore, "experience" and "knowledge" are two different things. "Experience" has no relation to "knowledge." Let me give another example. For instance, a woman's menstruation stops for two or three months, she often feels tired, nauseous, and vomits, and her abdomen grows larger day by day. Even a village elder woman knows that this is a sign of pregnancy. Can we admit that this elder woman understands medicine? In China, people often confuse "experience" with "knowledge." In reality, experience and knowledge are completely unrelated!</p>
<p>Finally, I have a supplement. Just now, a classmate advocated using local taxes to run local medical and charitable causes, so that poor people can benefit from the grace of scientific medicine. I think this is somewhat problematic. In China today, the names of exorbitant taxes have not been eliminated, and the people's burden has already been greatly increased. If we also implement this method, it would be equivalent to adding another burden to the people. In fact, I am afraid it is not a very appropriate method. In civilized countries today, there are so-called medical insurance fees, where a fraction of each person's salary is extracted and stored as a preparation for seeing a doctor and taking medicine. Our health administration should also imitate this method, which seems more appropriate than collecting taxes. That's all I have to contribute today. (End)</p>
<h3>Annoying Whooping Cough (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>The lovely spring is fleetingly approaching again. Prevailing infectious diseases have arrived in succession. Children are under attack during this harsh period. If parents do not possess considerable medical knowledge, how can they ensure the safety of their children's lives? The Shen Bao authorities, in view of this, publish a medical weekly every week to instill medical knowledge so that compatriots know how to prevent diseases. Even if they contract an infectious disease, they will not be at a loss. Among the recent prevalent infectious diseases, in addition to diphtheria, measles, and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, whooping cough is indeed a very important one. Unfortunately, compatriots belittle this disease and do not pay attention to it. As a result, every time it occurs, it spreads rampantly, and countless people die from this disease. Therefore, whooping cough is described in detail as follows to alert compatriots. Whooping cough, also known as "tian xiao qiang," is a special epidemic and endemic infectious disease. Because patients often have paroxysmal coughs and emit a special crying sound, it is commonly called "lulu cough." The mild cases heal in three or four weeks, while the severe ones linger for three or four months, hence the name "whooping cough." This disease occurs in all countries around the world, and its severity tends to increase with each epidemic, occurring approximately every three or four years. According to Toplitz's investigation, the morbidity rate of this disease is highest in children aged one to five. The average is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Children aged one year: 13.8%.</p>
<p>(2) Children aged two years: 20.7%.</p>
<p>(3) Children aged three to four years: approximately 13%.</p>
<p>(4) Gradually decreases after the age of five.</p>
<p>However, according to recent investigations by medical professionals, whooping cough has the highest mortality rate among children suffering from infectious diseases. Furthermore, this disease is often a precursor to other diseases, especially tuberculosis, preparing a place for it to settle. It is also the most unfortunate complication for patients with measles and rickets, often being whooping cough. A comparison of the mortality rates shows that the mortality rate for infants is 26%. The mortality rate for children aged one to two is 10%. As children grow older, the mortality rate also gradually decreases.</p>
<p>Causes... (1) Most often occurs during the transition between winter and spring, often becoming epidemic at one time. (2) Contact transmission. Sometimes, if one child in a family contracts this disease, all the children in the family are unable to escape. Children gathered in kindergartens, small schools, nurseries, and orphanages are particularly susceptible to infection. This is because when sick children cough, they spray out droplets of mucus or saliva, infecting other children. (3) Indirect transmission through bacteria. (4) Children aged one to five are most susceptible to infection. (5) Caused by Bordetella pertussis bacillus. (6) One infection provides immunity.</p>
<p>Symptoms... The incubation period varies from seven to ten days. Symptoms can be divided into three stages as follows: —</p>
<p>(1) Catarrhal stage. At the beginning of the onset, there are symptoms of a common cold, such as red eyes, sneezing, and runny nose. The trachea exhibits symptoms of dry cough and restlessness. Mild fever often occurs, ranging from 39 degrees to 40 degrees. At this time, continuous coughing is a key symptom. After seven to ten days, the cough intensifies.</p>
<h3>Pathological Conditions of the Chinese Medical Profession (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>(C) The Lack of Independence of Chinese Medical Affairs</p>
<p>Whether in administration or education, the development of medical affairs in our country has not been independent. This is our greatest shame. If the medical professions in advanced countries were independent, their progress would be rapid, making leaps and bounds. Because their medical professions are independent, free from external invasion and interference, they have the administrative power and educational strategies to strive for the development of medical affairs, which is promising. Otherwise, it is all in vain.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p>(1) Inconsistent Medical School Systems</p>
<p>Medical schools are the origin of medical talent. However, imperialists, with political backgrounds, implemented their ambitious policies and established medical schools in our country, promoting their abnormal development to increase their power. Each imperial power had its own sphere of influence. The school systems were different, and the medical talents produced were uneven, all of which were used by the imperialists. After graduation, they took the opportunity to enter politics, reversing the medical administration of China, creating opportunities for imperialists to invade, causing the medical affairs of China to be in a mess, which is obvious. This is because medical affairs are not independent and there is no power to rectify the school systems to unify them.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Legal Protection for the Medical Community</p>
<p>The medical profession is a free profession and has a close relationship with society. Society is complex, and of course there are good and bad people. If a doctor encounters a malicious accusation in court, the judge can convict him based on his own preferences because he sees that the medical profession is not independent. In this way, unjust sentences are inevitable, while real quack doctors may be lucky enough to be innocent. In this way, doctors are all in danger and cannot work with peace of mind to truly serve society.</p>
<p>(3) Disputes Between Factions</p>
<p>This is also because the medical profession is not independent and cannot eliminate the evil talents of Britain, America, Germany, Japan, France, and even traditional Chinese medicine doctors, and unify them into a real representative of Chinese medicine. Therefore, these evil forces still exist in society, erecting their respective factions, and aggressively attacking each other. Because they have different positions, they naturally exclude dissidents and compete with each other, implementing their selfish egoism for status and livelihood. If the medical profession can become independent sooner, it can be eliminated by administrative power.</p>
<p>(4) Lack of Creative Spirit</p>
<p>Academic research is the source of invention. Because most Japanese only know how to do their daily routine, holding on to the principle of getting by, and have no fearless spirit to create. They only know how to be lazy and copy other people's paths, thinking it is enough to apply it. To put it bluntly, they can't even catch up with the latest theories in advanced countries, let alone others. Exploring the root of the problem, this is also because the government has no reward system to reward those who are committed to innovation. Scholars, because there is no bonus anyway, who would bother to put in so much effort? If medical affairs can become independent sooner, and a reward system can be issued like in advanced countries, at least it can enable each scholar to make a contribution and unleash their creative spirit.</p>
<p>(5) Some Doctors Are Too Commercialized</p>
<p>The medical profession originally belongs to a charitable nature. If it is for business purposes, it has lost the essence of medical treatment as a benevolent art. These doctors can be called "jianghu doctors" because they lack moral cultivation and have no morality. If medical affairs can become independent sooner, these strange phenomena can also disappear.</p>
<p>(6) China Lacks a Qualified Representative Doctor</p>
<p>If medical affairs are independent, then administrative power can be used to train all doctors, whether scientific or traditional Chinese medicine doctors, and set up advanced training classes, giving them the opportunity to advance their studies. After the expiration, a strict examination is given to determine acceptance. If they meet the following conditions, they can be our country's true model representative doctors:</p>
<p>The mind must be scientific, the hands and feet must be people-oriented, able to understand all Chinese and Western theories, able to understand the people's sentiments, not westernized, not aristocratic, with a noble personality, and able to abide by medical ethics.</p>
<p>(7) The Ideal Medical Group Has Not Been Realized</p>
<p>This medical group was originally for the unity and solidarity of the medical community and to promote the development of the medical profession. Unfortunately, medical affairs are not independent, and there is no way to promote its realization.</p>

<p>(D) The Weakness of the Scientific Pharmaceutical Industry</p>
<p>Medicine and drugs are closely related. There has never been a case under heaven where a doctor does not rely on the power of drugs for treatment. Drugs are the only tool for doctors, without which there is no success.</p>
<p>In recent years, the cry for scientific national salvation has been soaring to the clouds. However, statistics show that outflow increases every year, and the pharmaceutical merchants of various imperialist countries have invaded our country's territory. If the people of the country do not try to extricate themselves and urgently seek the development of the national pharmaceutical industry to fight foreign aggression, then China's demise will not be far off. Here are the reasons for its weakness:</p>
<p>(1) Capitalists Are Unwilling to Invest in Pharmaceutical Factories</p>
<p>This is also because the people of the country have weak knowledge and, following the trend of the times, have wrong ideas. They are willing to deposit useful money in foreign banks for them to use. Even the few Chinese rich people who know how to use money only invest in old pharmaceutical industries or other industries, but not in pharmaceutical factories.</p>
<p>Recently, although there are relatively large-scale pharmaceutical factories in China, such as Xinya, Xinyi, and Minsheng, which have a vigorous new atmosphere, they are still not enough to supply even a fraction of what is needed domestically. I hope that capitalists will invest the money deposited in banks in pharmaceutical factories as much as possible, so that they will emerge endlessly like bamboo shoots after rain, and the scope will gradually expand to meet the needs of the people, with the principle of not relying on foreign countries at all.</p>
<p>(2) Influenced by Westernized Doctors</p>
<p>These types of doctors are influenced by the countries where they studied abroad. After returning to China, they try their best to westernize, and they must use western medicine to feel happy, regarding domestic famous medicines as worthless and unwilling to use them. For example, those who studied in Germany try their best to promote German medicine, and those who studied in Japan try their best to promote Japanese medicine, all of which affect the development of domestic medicine.</p>
<p>(3) Due to the Evil Forces of the Worshiping Foreign Mentality</p>
<p>The cry for promoting domestic goods has long resounded throughout the country. However, there are some people everywhere who are willing to be foreign slaves and slaves of a fallen country, thinking that "Chinese goods are always inferior to foreign goods" — therefore, domestic pharmaceutical factories are also affected.</p>
<p>(4) The Evils of Competition Among Peers</p>
<p>The horizons of the people of the country are not broad. They only know that a certain drug can make money, so they imitate it, making crude imitations, resulting in overstocking and cutting prices to compete with each other, and the result is that everyone is in a mess.</p>
<p>(5) The Evil of Not Knowing How to Be Progressive</p>
<p>Because there is a lack of specialized pharmaceutical talent in the country, they only seek small profits from drugs and do not engage in further research and development to seek development.</p>
<p>In summary, we can get a glimpse of the pathological conditions of the Chinese medical profession. I hope that the pioneers will prescribe the right medicine to make it healthy, so that the development of the Chinese medical profession can be expected. China is fortunate!</p>

<h3>The Medicine of Pain Relief (2)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>The general sensory mechanism for pain is in a certain part of the brain. For example, with heart pain, when a part of the heart is injured (by heart disease or trauma), the nerve receptors in the heart muscle send the sensation to the spinal cord in the spine via brain fibers, and then from the spinal cord to the brain, and thus there is a perception of heart pain. (The direction of the arrows in the diagram represents the direction of pain sensation transmission in the nervous system.) If this sensation does not reach the brain, one would not know there is pain even if the heart is injured. Another example is pain from a stomach ulcer, where irritation of the ulcerated area of the stomach is transmitted via brain fibers through the spinal cord to the brain, and the stomach pain is detected in the brain (see diagram). Other pain, such as gallbladder pain, kidney stone colic, and intestinal colic, uses the same method of sensory transmission. Now take skin pain as an example: when the skin is injured, the nerve receptors in the skin send the sensation via very long brain fibers to the spinal cord, and then through several nerve relays to the brain. Experiments have shown that the speed of nerve sensation transmission in the brain fibers is 50 to 80 meters per second. The distance from the fingers to the brain is approximately one meter, so it takes about one-fiftieth of a second to transmit sensation from the fingers to the brain. For example, if the nerve receptors at the site of skin injury are no longer sensitive, one will not feel pain because no sensation is transmitted to the brain. If the receptors are good but the brain fibers are severed, one will not feel pain either. Assuming that the other parts are intact, but if there is something wrong with the spinal cord or the lower part of the brain, or the pain center of the brain, one will also not feel pain. Now use the telephone as an analogy. A person uses a handset to make a phone call. This handset is like a nerve receptor. When the caller speaks, the sound travels through the receiver via electrical wires (like brain fibers) first to the telephone exchange (like the spinal cord and the lower part of the brain's nerve center), and then from the telephone exchange to the receiver. The receiver (like the brain) can then know what is being said. If anything goes wrong in any part, the message will not reach its destination.</p>
<p>Pain receptors are located throughout the body. No matter where you prick with a small needle, you will hit at least one receptor. Skin pain is easy to feel in a specific place. The location of internal organ pain is not so clear. For example, liver or stomach pain is not easily felt as specifically liver pain or stomach pain. Toothache is similar to internal organ pain, so toothache is often felt as skin pain on the face. Furthermore, pain is also the last of all human senses to be lost, meaning that all other senses stop, but pain remains.</p>
<p>Types of Pain. Pain can be mild or severe. There are the following specialized terms to describe various types of pain: (1) Dull pain (or aching pain) is long-lasting, continuous, but not severe. (2) Sharp pain (or acute pain) is very severe pain. (3) Stabbing pain (pain like being stabbed with a knife). (4) Shooting pain (like being shot with a bullet). (5) Throbbing pain (pain that comes in pulses). (6) Pulling pain (pain like a heavy object is pulling down). (7) Hunger pain (pain when hungry). (8) Radiating pain (pain spreading from a single point to a large area). (9) Referred pain (pain at a site without disease, reflecting pain from a diseased site, so the site without disease is also painful). Referred pain is pain in an area without disease, so it is easily misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>The best example of referred pain is duodenal ulcer pain, which is often felt at the top of the head and on the right shoulder blade (see second diagram). We know that the duodenum and the neck are far apart, but this type of pain is called referred pain. The reason for this is the connection of the brain fibers. Other referred pain includes pain in the back below the right shoulder when there is gallbladder or bile duct pain (see second and third diagrams). The skin of the waist is also painful when there is kidney pain (see second diagram). Pain in the uterus or the inside of the rectum and anus of women is also referred to the lower back at the same time (see second diagram). Similarly, when there is colic caused by stones in the kidney or ureter, there is also referred pain in the testicle on the same side (see third diagram). Other referred pain expressed on the upper abdomen, such as pain in the small intestine, is found at the navel (see third diagram). Appendix pain is between the navel and the right iliac bone. Pain in the large intestine is reflected in the lower abdomen (see third diagram). The part of the referred pain is not painful because of the disease, but because of the reaction of the brain fiber connection. This is a very common pain during childbirth, so understanding these reasons is also of considerable value.</p>
<h3>Common Sense About Diseases Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(53) Septicemia</p>
<p>Sepsis Septicaemia (Continued)</p>
<p>(Question) When septicemia occurs, what symptoms appear in the motor system?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most common symptom in the motor system is arthritis. It often affects multiple joints or a single joint. The result is perarticular abscesses, periostitis, or osteomyelitis. In addition, purulent myositis or cellulitis may occur.</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms appear in the respiratory system?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the respiratory system, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, purulent pleurisy, etc., may occur.</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms appear in the digestive system?</p>
<p>(Answer) The symptoms in the digestive system are a dry tongue, a black, coal-like coating on the tongue, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Sometimes, septicemic diarrhea may also occur. In addition, there may be hepatomegaly, liver abscess, etc. The spleen may also be swollen.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the visual system change?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes, significant changes occur. Such as retinal hemorrhage, retinal white spots; in addition, there may be optic neuritis, septicemic endophthalmitis.</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms appear in the kidneys?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is febrile proteinuria, sometimes leading to interstitial nephritis, embolic nephritis, hemorrhagic glomerulonephritis, or kidney abscesses or hemoglobinuria, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) What should the diagnostic method for septicemia be?</p>
<p>(Answer) To diagnose septicemia, the most important thing is to test for bacteria in the blood; however, if bacteria are found in the blood once, it cannot be immediately determined to be septicemia. This is because many infectious diseases often cause transient bacteremia. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly check whether there are bacteria in the blood to be sure.</p>
<p>(Question) What diseases should septicemia be differentiated from in diagnosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It should be differentiated from typhoid fever, meningitis, miliary tuberculosis, acute arthritis, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) How to differentiate it from typhoid fever?</p>
<p>(Answer) Typhoid fever does not have rapid pulse, increased white blood cells, joint swelling, or skin and retinal hemorrhages.</p>
<p>(Question) How to differentiate it from meningitis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Meningitis does not have splenomegaly or pericarditis. Also, cerebrospinal fluid is normal in septicemia.</p>
<p>(Question) How to differentiate it from miliary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) In miliary tuberculosis, there must be choroidal tubercles and various other tuberculous foci.</p>
<p>(Question) How to differentiate it from acute arthritis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Acute arthritis does not have skin hemorrhages and splenomegaly.</p>
<p>(Question) What other diseases should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>(Answer) It should be distinguished from pneumonia, malignant boils, or uremia.</p>
<p>(Question) Is the prognosis of septicemia dangerous?</p>
<p>(Answer) Very dangerous.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the treatment for septicemia?</p>
<p>(Answer) Anti-streptococcal serum or polyvalent serum, colloidal silver solution, or De Kruif's flavine solution can be injected. Take Optochin internally. In addition, inject physiological saline, or perform blood transfusion after bloodletting. And inject cardiotonics. (End)</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat and Eyes</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(34) Scarlet Fever (Continued)</p>
<p>(6) Effects of Scarlet Fever on the Circulatory System II During the course of scarlet fever. Acute endocarditis, myocarditis, or pericarditis can often be triggered.</p>
<p>(7) Effects of Scarlet Fever on the Nervous System II When the body temperature is high. There are often phenomena such as delirium, restlessness, and insomnia. If in children. Seizures often occur. Or even suffer from meningitis. And meet with misfortune.</p>
<p>Is scarlet fever dangerous after all... In the past, the general public. Did not know that scarlet fever. Is an acute exanthematous infectious disease. It was only regarded as a disease like measles and smallpox. So, names like "red measles" were coined (the name was discussed in detail last time). And did not care about the word "dangerous." But now. Everyone has recognized scarlet fever. Knows that it is an acute exanthematous infectious disease. Also understands its danger. Speaking of the mortality rate of scarlet fever. It may not necessarily be possible to express it with a number. Because there are differences. Ordinary statistics. Are two to eight percent. However, this percentage varies depending on the nature of the epidemic, individual resistance, the state of systemic infection, the age of the person, and the severity of the complications. For example, if it is a hemorrhagic scarlet fever. Then there will definitely be a danger to life. And if it is complicated by scarlet fever nephritis. Or commits cerebral symptoms. Or changes in the circulatory system occur. Then it is also often dangerous.</p>
<p>Prevention of Scarlet Fever... The infectivity of this disease. Is particularly strong. Therefore, when there is suspicion of this disease. It should be sent to the hospital for isolation immediately. If it is inconvenient to send to the hospital due to various reasons. Isolation should also be implemented in the family. Refuse visits from relatives and friends. Avoid all opportunities for infection. The patient's clothes, bed, books, toys, etc. Should all be strictly disinfected. Furthermore, the patient's secretions and excretions. Like tears, nasal mucus, sputum, feces, epidermal exfoliations, etc. Should pay close attention to disinfection and disposal.</p>
<p>The gateway for the scarlet fever virus to enter. I have already said. Is probably from the palatine tonsils (commonly known as milk moths). If the palatine tonsils develop hypertrophy. That is a sign of an open gateway. The virus will also easily invade. The age at which palatine tonsil hypertrophy is most easily infected. Is the same as scarlet fever. Is also children around five years old. So, I have a point of view. That is, when a child around five years old. Suffering from palatine tonsil hypertrophy. Parents should instruct a specialist to examine and decide. The hypertrophic palatine tonsils should be surgically removed. This will not only eradicate the gateway for the scarlet fever virus to invade. And also reduce all tonsil diseases.</p>
<p>Treatment of Scarlet Fever... The general treatment of scarlet fever. Is also the same as general infectious diseases. The ward should be selected to be well-ventilated and large. The food should be liquid and easily digestible. Pay attention to oral hygiene. The most effective main treatment method recently. Is to inject scarlet fever streptococcal serum early. If the injection is appropriate. Most can turn danger into safety and heal. In the third week of the disease. Urinalysis should be performed frequently. Observe the presence or absence of protein. This is the key to early prevention of nephritis. After scarlet fever is cured. The patient should continue to be isolated and remain in bed for at least two weeks. Do not associate with healthy people immediately. These regulations are already stipulated by organized health administrative agencies. (End)</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (41)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Clinical Course</p>
<p>What are the clinical manifestations of Ranke's primary infection? In the past medical community, the answer was always a unanimous "no." The recognition of primary complexes was entirely dependent on the assistance of X-rays after they had healed, in order to understand them even partially. In other words, there were no clinical symptoms to be found. Recently, it has become clear that this is not entirely true. With the significant progress in X-ray examinations, clinical examples are also very common. The initial situation is very similar to the symptoms of the flu. The temperature increases and then subsides and returns to normal after a few days. The patient has no cough, no sputum, and only feels slightly tired. Physical and blood tests show no special abnormalities. However, X-ray examination does indeed show shadows. This lesion usually does not require special treatment and will stop progressing. The glands inside the lungs are also often affected; however, if the lesion has healed, it will also stop progressing and become latent. The details of this will be discussed further in the section on hilar lymph node tuberculosis.</p>
<p>If secondary infiltration occurs near the hilar lymph nodes, the extent of the lesion is of course larger than the initial complex; X-ray examination also provides considerable confirmation. However, there are no differences in the clinical aspect. Therefore, we can only mention the early diagnosis aspect now! The basic types in this area are hilar lymph node tuberculosis, independent infiltration and mid-field infiltration, and apical tuberculosis. I will now describe them one by one below:</p>
<p>A. On the side of hilar lymph node tuberculosis, what is most likely to attract attention is tracheobronchial lymph node tuberculosis! It occurs most often in children, almost exclusively; it is relatively rare in adults. There are not many clinical symptoms that can be specifically mentioned; symptoms such as paleness, unhappiness, disordered temperature increase or decrease, rapid pulse, etc., can all be caused by other reasons. A more obvious symptom is convulsive coughing, which is very similar to whooping cough; this is generally caused by severe pressure on the tracheal bifurcation. The inspiratory sound is longer, with a whistling sound, which is only seen in physical examination. As for adults suffering from this, they mostly seek medical attention due to fatigue, severe stomach pain, palpitations, etc., which is completely different from what children suffer from. Although the clinical symptoms are sometimes present and sometimes not, there is no basis for reliance, but the X-ray examination is very significant. Even the size and shape of the swollen glands can be roughly determined from the radiograph. In addition, the tuberculin reaction is mostly positive, which is also a very powerful corroborating evidence. We might as well boldly say that in children whose tuberculin reaction is now positive, if no other lesions are found, tracheobronchial lymph node tuberculosis can simply be considered certain. The course of the disease is generally very good in both adults and children, so the prognosis cannot be said to be bad. However, if the patient develops diseases such as measles and whooping cough, the disease will also spread to the lungs and tend to worsen. Also, caseous glandular tissue may sometimes rupture blood vessels, resulting in acute miliary tuberculosis and leading to incurable disease. However, this situation is ultimately a minority; generally speaking, its complications are still a minority compared to others. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On Imprisonment for Tax Arrears</h3>
<p>— Wu Guyu</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>China, historically governed by a policy of passive inaction, finds itself today grappling with the land problem, a crucial element for its agricultural society. This issue has consistently held our attention as observers of Chinese affairs. However, devising a solution within our vague and abstract imaginings remains an elusive goal. It is common for the nation's finances to experience various imbalances and difficulties in revenue collection, leading to the implementation of measures that disregard practical realities. Moreover, the inherent contradictions make it truly impossible to generate decisive power.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend from my hometown, Jiaxing, came to see me. Here's an excerpt from his account:</p>
<p>"...In my hometown, before the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), each acre of land, after paying taxes, yielded a net income of about two and a half silver dollars. After 1931, rice prices frequently fell and surcharges increased daily. By last year, it was almost a loss. Last year, the average income was four and seven-tenths dou of unpolished rice per acre, with each dan of unpolished rice priced at four and a half dollars, totaling about two dollars and one dime. On the expenditure side, each acre required the payment of regular and surtaxes of one dollar and eighty-eight cents, plus about one dollar and ninety cents for boatmen's expenses during rent collection. Subtracting expenses from income, each acre yielded a net surplus of only about two dimes. How can those who formerly lived off five hundred acres now make a living? (The above refers to a generally better situation; my own income decreased greatly last year because I was not at home, resulting in a loss of about four or five dimes per acre.) Even more distressing is the increasingly urgent demand for tax payments. I have accumulated tax arrears of six or seven hundred dollars, which I am currently struggling to cope with. If I continue to ignore this, I fear an arrest warrant is imminent, so I plan to move elsewhere within the month to avoid trouble... Is the county government's frequent arrest for tax collection legally justifiable?"</p>
<p>In this brief account, my friend is about to relocate to "evade taxes"! He also asks whether imprisonment for tax arrears is legally justifiable. While a simple answer could suffice, I wish to delve into the inherent severity of the issue rather than focusing solely on the current legal implications.</p>
<p>II. A Brief Account of Landlords' Harsh Practices and the Dark Side of Revenue Collection</p>
<p>The form of land ownership in China has historically lacked advanced legal regulation, allowing villagers to freely control land. This disregard for the nation and society's obligation to utilize land for economic purposes, coupled with excessive freedom in land rights, has led to an extremely complex phenomenon. The intricacies of Chinese land rights are evident in terms like field base rights, field surface rights, pawn rights, pawn rent, half-field, and perpetual field rights.</p>
<p>Given the limited space, we dare not expand the discussion too broadly, but it's important to understand that this is a complex and pressing issue in China today. We will now briefly discuss the simple social relationships related to land, focusing on landlords and tenants.</p>
<p>The people most closely associated with land are generally landlords and tenants. Legally, the landlord is the owner and, according to Article 765 of the Civil Code, has the right to freely use, profit from, and dispose of the property. If the owner does not use the property themselves, they can grant usage to others in exchange for income based on their right of free disposal. The tenant, according to Article 842 of the Civil Code, has the right to cultivate or raise livestock permanently on another's land by paying rent. Perpetual tenancy rights are established to restrict landlords from evicting tenants or tenants from abandoning the land. Additionally, there is the cultivator who, according to Article 832 of the Civil Code, uses another's land for the purpose of erecting structures. Therefore, they are persons enjoying surface rights. The landlord is the owner of the field base right, and the tenant is the owner of the field surface right. From this perspective, landlords and tenants have equal rights, with no apparent inequality in their relationship.</p>
<p>However, as I mentioned earlier, China's politics have historically been passive and inactive, with tenancy issues largely unregulated by law and left to the villagers to resolve freely. Practices vary not only between provinces and counties but even within the same village. The economic and social inequality between landlords and tenants is less a matter of ethical responsibility and more a remnant of feudal inequalities.</p>
<p>In addition to monetary and in-kind rent, harsh practices are prevalent in the landlord-tenant relationship in China, such as: (1) offering primary products as tribute, such as foot rice in Zhejiang, strength rice or foot sale in Jiangsu, and field letter rice or partner head rice in Guangdong; (2) offering secondary products as tribute, such as rice straw in Hunan, corn rent, chili rent, and fruit rent in Guizhou, firewood in Jiangxi, beans in Hubei, sweet potatoes and vegetables in Guangdong; (3) offering by-products as tribute, mainly poultry such as field letter chickens, letter chickens, partner head chickens, rent chickens, field letter ducks, letter ducks, partner head ducks, rent ducks, as well as rent geese in Zhejiang, and rent fish, pork, and wine in Guangdong and Hunan, rent pigs and fruit in Guizhou, and wheat flour in Hubei; (4) offering money as tribute, such as field letter money in Guangdong, small rent money and submissive year money in Jiangxi, and urging early fees in Jiangsu; (5) offering banquets as tribute. When a tenancy agreement is established, rent is determined, the agreement is amended, or the agreement is terminated, the tenant must host not only the landlord but also their relatives, friends, intermediaries, or representatives. This custom is common throughout China. The banquet at the establishment of the tenancy agreement is called acknowledging the landlord or renting a field to invite a host. The banquet when rent is determined is called rent rice. The banquet when the agreement is amended is called asking the landlord for change. The banquet when the agreement is terminated is called tenant departure wine. (6) Offering labor as tribute. In some parts of China, tenants do not pay rent with produce but instead offer labor. In Jiangxi province, this is called labor rent. However, the labor offered here is in addition to the rent paid to the landlord, representing a form of additional rent. The landlord is supposed to provide food, but without compensation. Tenants consider the offering of labor to the landlord as mandatory. This practice is widespread in Henan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces, often referred to as servants, errands, rent labor, and firewood duties. This labor is used for tasks such as carrying sedan chairs, fetching water, and miscellaneous chores. During funerals, weddings, moving houses, and construction, it involves serving meals, reception, pulling carts, and basic construction work. (7) Offering life as tribute. In this extreme scenario, when rent cannot be paid, wives and daughters are offered to the landlord as slaves, referred to as human resources. In Guangshan County, Henan, it includes participating in armed gatehouses.</p>
<p>The above is just a general overview of the harsh practices landlords impose on tenants and lacks complete and detailed investigation. However, it is clear that these are economically unjustifiable and cruel conditions. One possible reason is that landlords, facing political pressure from increased taxes, are forced to pass the burden onto the tenants.</p>
<p>Chinese officials are considered good as long as they don't disturb the people, meaning they remain purely passive and inactive. Officials who are both passive and disturb the people are considered bad. Villagers fear officials like wolves and respect them like deities. From what I know, the larger landlords in my hometown were regarded with deity-like respect by tenants before 1931. Furthermore, those working in government offices—revenue collection personnel—dare not do anything to landlords because they are wealthy and powerful. Extorting money under the guise of intimidation (revenue collectors going to villages to arrest people for extortion is called pounding boat heads) is always directed towards farmers or tenants. Clerks often own land, and many landlords collude with revenue collectors to exploit tenants. According to reliable investigations, in some parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, landlords can freely detain tenants to force rent payment or request the county government to imprison tenants. In Wu County, Jiangsu, landlords have established tenant detention centers, where they can obtain blank arrest warrants from the county government and freely detain tenants. Other counties have established names such as the Field Industry Association and rent collection bureaus, where the county government sends people to collect rent for landlords, and these bureaus can freely beat tenants.</p>
<p>Having reached this point, we have described the situation of pressuring farmers. We are also keenly aware that the revenue collection of land taxes in various counties is fundamentally a confused mess. I remember that in 1931, students from the Zhejiang Finance Personnel Training Institute were sent to practice in various county governments. Some conscientious students requested to inspect the revenue collection ledgers, but the persons in charge explicitly stated that they could not be publicly disclosed, as it would cause external criticism. As a result, the Shanghai Times of February 3rd this year had the following news about Gao Yucun, the director of the grain price collection office of the Jiaxing Finance Bureau, absconding with embezzled funds and being arrested in Shanghai without success:</p>
<p>"Gao Yucun from Jiaxing, formerly the director of the grain counter collection office of the Jiaxing Finance Bureau, is suspected of embezzling more than 40,000 yuan of public funds and abandoning his post to abscond. The director of the bureau discovered this and requested the local authorities to pay attention to the investigation. Director Wang has learned that Gao is living in Shanghai... and sent a letter to the county government to transfer the matter to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to forward to the First Special Court for an arrest warrant... It is reported that Gao Yucun has fled after hearing the news... Gao Yucun has absconded with more than 40,000 yuan of embezzled public funds, and is ordered to be investigated. Now that Gao Yucun has fled, his son Gao Anke has been arrested, because his father embezzled national public funds, and his son is responsible, and so on..."</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the Second Rural Work Discussion Meeting in Ding County, Mr. Hu Ciwei, the magistrate of Lanxi Experimental County, reported, as reported in the Dagong Daily on the 4th of this month:</p>
<p>"...The fish scale book was compiled and checked once in the fifth year of Tongzhi (1866), with 900 copies stored in the county office. Due to the long time, 400 copies have been lost. At that time, the compilation of the fish scale book used 302 clerks. These clerks are usually responsible for collecting money and grain for the county government, called grain clerks. When compiling the fish scale book, each clerk kept a copy of his own management as a basis for collecting money and grain. In addition to the fish scale book, each clerk also compiled a separate registration book. When a field is transferred, the clerk immediately records it in the registration book. By combining the fish scale book and the registration book, it is possible to know the changes in the fields. Which surname originally owned which place, and which surname owns it now? Those who cannot be investigated in the county government's fish scale book can be found in the clerk's private registration book. However, this registration book is regarded by the grain clerk as the source of his livelihood, a secret that is not passed on. Therefore, the county magistrate has never been willing to hand it over when he asks for a copy..."</p>
<p>I am paying close attention to citing these facts to prove that the collection of land taxes in China is generally not collected according to a fixed number. The basic fish scale book is still from the Tongzhi era, and it is mostly in the hands of revenue collection personnel. If the county magistrate is not originally for the people, which official would think of checking it, and it is too late to worry about the storms of his official career, and the lack of taxes has long been a common disease. Especially funny, the Jiaxing revenue collection director Gao Yucun did not have any good news about recovering the more than 40,000 yuan he embezzled later.</p>
<p>In principle, the collection of land taxes in various counties is done by "scattered households" because it is inconvenient or farmers are too busy to do it themselves, so village guarantors pay them on their behalf. Of course, some guarantors turn over all the money paid by the entrusted people to the grain. However, it is not uncommon for them to encroach on them, because villagers always attach importance to string tickets--receipts for completing the payment of land taxes, so there is no way to investigate. As for the current revenue collection officials (Hebei is now called the political police, which is the former village clerk) are also responsible for paying land taxes on behalf of others. In short, whether it is a guarantor or a revenue collection official paying on behalf of others, there is a drawback of embezzlement. It is said that in Hebei Province, villagers hand over the part they should pay to the "village servant" and then do not ask about it; the village servant also knows that the villagers do not ask about it, and always does not hand over the full amount to the revenue grain. Sometimes the village servant uses this to deceive the police who are appointed to collect the revenue, and the political police are even more likely to imitate the village servant's exploitation, or even collude with each other, with both sides embezzling. Sometimes the political police go to the countryside to collect debts, and villagers are arrested for resistance. If they give a little bribe, they can be released; but the validity period of this release is always directly proportional to the amount of bribe. If this happens again and again more than ten times, the collectors will be full of private decline, and the scattered households will still owe taxes, and the bribes they have spent are actually greater than the taxes they should pay.</p>
<p>III. The Hardship of Owning Land Today</p>
<p>The above is nothing more than proving the dark facts of China's finance, which is cheating the top and fattening the bottom, restraining each other, and exploiting it again and again. The collection of land taxes is like a pile of tangled hemp, and its social relationship is in a state of anarchy. But we should pay attention to the following: the order of a society, regardless of whether there is class opposition, heavy exploitation, or mutual restraint; in short, as long as it is an order that is firmly established, even if it is full of unequal forms and unreasonable behavior without conscience. Generally speaking, as long as it is an established order, there will not be any problems.</p>
<p>However, the wheel of time has dragged China in. The static society has been shaken, oppressed, and tempted by external forces, and is rapidly changing, causing chemical reactions. Looking at the current situation, is it the so-called "periodic chaos" before closing the country?</p>
<p>We cannot discuss the big problem of today's chaos in the entire China here, but can only focus on our topic to discuss the hardship of owning land today. However, we must understand that today's chaos in China is triggered externally, which is absolutely different from the chaos in the past.</p>
<p>According to the letter from the friend in front: we can see the factors of the hardship of the landlords who own the land: (1) rice prices are falling frequently, (2) surtaxes are increasing day by day, and one point is after the 25% rent reduction, (3) income is greatly reduced, we will temporarily follow his algorithm. Let's first look at the family economic situation of a landlord who owns 500 acres of land:</p>
<p>A family owning 500 acres is undoubtedly a large landlord. The previous net income was (500 acres × 2.5 yuan 1250.00 yuan) 1,250 yuan. Compared with the current 67.5 yuan, the difference is (12350.00:67.50=16.5) 18.5 times. This is said to be a general better state, and it only has a surplus of 67.5 yuan. That is to say, according to him, the maximum net surplus per acre is only 67.5 yuan. That is to say, according to him, the maximum net surplus per acre is only more than 2 dimes, then 500 acres is only more than 100 yuan, and a family of 500 acres must have a lot of mouths and scenes, or even a large family. If they still live by guarding the property, I really don't know how life will continue?</p>
<p>I also have a friend, Mr. So-and-so, who is one of the largest landlords in Jiabei, owning about 3,000 acres of land, but in his conversation with me, it means the following:</p>
<p>The highest estimate is still the same, and each acre can have a net surplus of more than 2 dimes, then 3,000 acres should have an income of more than 600 yuan. Coincidentally, his fields are located in the area of the Sujia Highway, and there is a very long section for the highway roadbed. In the year when the road was built, because it could not be planted, the tenants of course did not pay the rent, but the silver grain of that year had to be completed. The silver grain can be paid off in the second year, but the problem comes again. After the highway is built, the soil on both sides of the road is dug out to build the roadbed, turning it into a long water pool; the fields in the long water pool area of course cannot ask the tenants for rent again, but according to the algorithm in the county government, the water pool area still has to pay grain except for the roadbed. The fields in the roadbed area may still have a glimmer of hope to get the land price from the government, but the long water pool area cannot collect rent, and still has to pay grain and cannot get back the land price. This kind of insensitivity to the actual situation simply wants people to create something out of nothing to pay taxes. I really don't understand why there is such an unreasonable thing in China today.</p>
<p>Although the latter phenomenon is more special, the highway is very long, and the number must be small! Naturally, some small farmers will completely lose their property because of this. However, the hardship of the former is too common, and it is undeniable.</p>
<p>In addition, this year Jiangnan has suffered from drought. I heard that the newly added beggars who are holding babies in their arms and carrying bamboo baskets are filling the streets. Has the current authority not considered this large group of basic industrial troops?</p>
<p>The landlords in the whirlpool have more fields and more erosion. They cannot but spend money at home, and their income is insufficient, so they can only owe taxes: the year before last plus the year, the year before last plus this year, rolling and storing, and the people who owe so much that they are dizzy are everywhere. In the past, "field" was thought to be the root of "rich," but today it has been regarded as the head of "burden."</p>
<p>Is there any turning point to this serious problem of tax arrears so that landlords can pay it off?</p>
<p>"Field" has long been regarded as the head of "burden" in the eyes of landlords. It is said that one person was so tightly urged that he asked the county government to "pay taxes with field." At that time, a certain county magistrate thought it was a way, and accepted it without thinking. Unexpectedly, this example was only opened, and many landlords had to follow suit. There is no predetermined policy to solve this problem in the Chinese government that "has no way to go," and as a result, the method of "paying taxes with field" is not successful.</p>
<p>In short, in today's days of continuous natural disasters and people passing through exchanges, farmers are no longer afraid of you to pull the boat head, but regard being in prison as a way to solve life that they cannot get. Landlords have already complained about the pain of owning land, and it is willing to give away land. Alas! Is there really a country in the world where people are willing to go to jail and give away their property!</p>
<p>IV. Epilogue</p>
<p>At this time when the national financial deficit is huge and has been in a deep hole for a long time, coupled with the external erosion and internal moth, the people's strength has long been exhausted, and the crisis of total collapse is already clearly in sight. Moreover, the peasants who were once regarded as an exploitative class by the public opinion are now willing to give their land for free, but they cannot get it. The farmers who love face and reason are willing to go to prison today, but they cannot get it. The current authority only cares about the head and forgets the tail, and does it hard. I think it is a dead end. We must know that laws and policies must be practical. If they are not practical, the country will be in danger! If we kill chickens to get eggs and drain the pond to get fish for a long time, who will the eggs and fish depend on next year?</p>
<p>(Postscript) In this article, I am angry that the author does not propose a plan or outline of suggestions, nor does he describe the process of the decline of the landlords in detail, because such problems as the 25% rent reduction or other problems need a longer length to describe. This is just a hint of a part of the economic stage of the countryside today. Moreover, I did not answer my friend's question of "is it legal to ban tax arrears," and I hope that those who care about national affairs will discuss it more.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This article was submitted last year, and it was only published after a period of four months. The "this year" mentioned in the article refers to the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934).</p>
<h3>Review of China's Foreign Trade Last Year</h3>
<p>— Qinglin</p>
<p>Last year, the domestic economic situation was plagued by floods and droughts in both the north and south, leading to poor harvests. Industry and commerce suffered from competition from foreign goods and weak purchasing power among the people, teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. At the same time, rising silver prices abroad caused a continuous outflow of silver, resulting in financial exhaustion and a clear downward trend. The severity of the economic crisis was evident. How could one expect a thriving foreign trade under such circumstances? Looking at last year's customs report, the total trade volume for the year was 1,029,665,224 yuan, a decrease of 315,901,964 yuan compared to the 1,345,567,188 yuan in 1933, a decrease of approximately 20.05%. Imports decreased by 23.47%, and exports decreased by 12.52%. The annual trade deficit was more than 494 million yuan, a significant decrease compared to the 733 million yuan in 1933. This proves the poor state of the domestic economy, but the implementation of the new tariff also played a role. The trade volume for each month is listed below to provide a glimpse of the overall trend:</p>
<p>Judging from the figures in the above table, January had the highest volume. February, being the abolished Lunar New Year, was traditionally a slow month. From March to June, the situation gradually returned to normal, with monthly trade deficits of around 100 million yuan. After the implementation of the new tariff on July 1, the deficits decreased compared to previous months. However, in November, they rebounded, with imports increasing by 6% and exports by 16% compared to October. This unusual phenomenon was partly due to seasonal factors and partly due to favorable exchange rates, so it did not last. By December, the figures had dropped again, marking the lowest month of the year.</p>
<p>Since the global economic downturn in 1929, our country has been affected. According to customs statistics, last year's total trade volume decreased to 56% compared to 1929. The import and export figures for each year are listed below: (Unit: million yuan)</p>
<p>However, the foreign trade figures for the puppet state of Manchukuo are included in the table above, making it difficult to accurately assess the overall trade trend. Moreover, the three Eastern Provinces have abundant soybean production and usually have a trade surplus. For comparison purposes, it is necessary to remove the figures for the three Eastern Provinces from 1929 to 1932 to ensure accuracy. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>From the table above, it can be seen that the overall decline in China's foreign trade was 41%, not 56%. Imports fell by 36%, and exports decreased by 50%. The most significant reason for the trade decline in recent years is the economic downturn in the United States, which has plunged the world into a whirlpool. The impact of this decline on our country was felt in 1933, and it has become even more severe this year. In 1932, imports decreased sharply by 24%, and exports fell by nearly 38%. Last year, both imports and exports continued to decline, with no progress made at the beginning of this year. However, various countries are making efforts to recover, and there are signs of gradual recovery. What about us?</p>
<p>The trade deficit in 1934 was lower than in the past five years. Therefore, many are optimistic that our country can improve its economic and financial standing only by achieving a balance between imports and exports. The trade deficit last year decreased by more than 23.9 million yuan compared to 1933. If import taxes could be increased further last year, the import of foreign goods could be further reduced.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy aspect of trade by country last year was the decline of the United Kingdom to third place, while Japan jumped to the top. However, the United States still held the top spot, with import volume double that of other countries. Our country's exports to the United States decreased compared to 1933, while both imports and exports to the United Kingdom increased. Germany and the Dutch East Indies also saw increases. However, Australia experienced a significant decline. In the previous year, Australia imported a large amount of flour, but the Cotton and Wheat Loan Agreement affected this. However, that agreement has ended, and it is expected that Australia will have another opportunity to compete. The major trading countries and their percentages are listed below:</p>
<p>Among the imports last year, only the following seven categories increased compared to the previous year, out of a total import value of 315,901,5649: Machinery and tools increased by 16,173,309 yuan, tobacco by 4,346,516 yuan, groceries by 3,571,923 yuan, wool and woolen fabrics by 2,195,690 yuan, metals and ores by 1,971,110 yuan, transportation equipment by 704,840 yuan, and flax and flax products by 529,041 yuan. The following categories of imports also decreased: Grains decreased by 162,796,283 yuan compared to 1933, soap and oil products by 59,018,265 yuan, cotton fabrics by 34,473,981 yuan, miscellaneous metals by 19,663,115 yuan, coal and fuel by 11,297,641 yuan, chemical products by 9,741,967 yuan, sugar by 9,562,471 yuan, cotton by 8,711,043 yuan, silk and silk fabrics by 6,212,590 yuan, and books and maps by 6,327,863 yuan.</p>
<p>In terms of imports last year, the largest items were cotton fabrics, grains, oils, machinery, and metals, followed by transportation equipment, sugar, tobacco, chemical products, dyes, pigments, and books. In terms of exports, raw and processed leather, textiles, and tea were the largest items, followed by oils, waxes, and grains.</p>
<p>The commodity trade last year was generally similar to the previous year, but the significant decrease in silk exports and the significant increase in tea exports are worth studying. The increase in imports of machinery and metals may also be a positive sign. What happens next depends on how well we handle things!</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is undeniable that our country's economy is becoming increasingly precarious, and the decline in trade is particularly concerning. To revitalize the economy, we must start with fundamental reforms and support rural revitalization and important industries.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rate Remains at 9%</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and trading was relatively quiet. Moreover, businesses were eager to settle accounts early to avoid being squeezed by the clearinghouse, making the market even more subdued. Traditionally, trading is more active during the Lantern Festival, but due to the impact of the end of last year, traders remained cautious, resulting in limited call loan transactions. Morning turnover was over 2 million yuan, with new transactions of over 300,000 yuan. The call loan rate remained at 9%, the same as the previous day. Clearing for foreign government bonds was over 13.7 million yuan, with remittances from various routes exceeding 100,000 yuan and receipts from customers exceeding 200,000 yuan. Outgoing payments were 100,000 yuan, and foreign collateral recovered was over 200,000 yuan, with 100,000 yuan in new loans. Subsidiary currency rates fell across the board. Jiangnan small silver opened at 835 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan, with 2,000 jiao traded. Guangdong small silver was at 743 yuan and 3 jiao, a decrease of 2 yuan and 7 jiao from the previous day, with 260,000 jiao traded. Copper coins were at 330 qian wen, a decrease of 1,000 wen, with 52,800 strings of wen traded, equivalent to 16,000 yuan. The afternoon market remained closed.</p>
<h3>Securities: 23rd Customs Bonds Showed Unusual Surge Last Week</h3>
<p>From February 11th to 16th last week, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange experienced a localized and unusual tension. The atmosphere was completely dominated by a group of bullish companies manipulating the frenzied surge of the 23rd Customs Bonds. Those who shorted were largely in a state of panic. It is estimated that the number of 23rd Customs Bonds in circulation outside the Exchange is no more than 3 to 4 million yuan. Although the Central Bank holds over 10 million yuan in inventory, the remaining bonds are largely scattered among various banks. The manipulators were thus draining the pond to catch all the fish, driving up prices wildly. The highest price reached 81 yuan and 8 jiao, only 5 yuan and 2 jiao away from the face value. The market price was equivalent to 95% of the face value, and the market atmosphere was extremely tense. Brokers and colleagues also discussed this, some suggesting that once the price reaches the face value, the Exchange would certainly suspend trading. The pain of the short sellers would be even greater than this, and disputes would inevitably arise, which would not be good for the brokers. Because the organizers were rumored to have the backing of powerful figures in the financial world, everyone agreed not to accept new transactions. In fact, the manipulators themselves felt that the way out was difficult, because those who followed their trend to go long were truly numerous. If the organizers slightly relaxed their grip, the sellers would surely rise like a storm, and the market price would plummet, allowing others to take advantage of the manipulators. Therefore, they are currently in a dilemma, caught between advancing and retreating. There are not many days left in this month, and there will certainly be fierce changes in the future. The fact that other bonds sometimes moved in the completely opposite direction from the 23rd Customs Bonds made market participants even more uneasy. Most prices fluctuated and tended to weaken. Last week, the 23rd Customs Bonds saw a sharp surge on Monday, rising sharply by 4 yuan and triggering a circuit breaker when other bonds were falling sharply. There were obviously manipulators at play, otherwise, there would be no such abnormally large disparity. On Tuesday, the frenzy surrounding the 23rd Customs Bonds continued, and the market was chaotic, turbulent, and full of surprises. Price changes were extreme. The 96 Customs Bonds fell sharply by more than 1 yuan, while the 23rd Customs Bonds rose again by 1 yuan and 7 jiao. On Wednesday, due to the Finance Ministry's complete denial of rumors about recalling the 23rd Customs Bonds, a sudden backlash occurred, and the cracks appeared. The downward trend was like a broken bamboo, and the magnitude of the waves was shocking. The advance halted and retreat was continuous, plunging by more than 2 yuan. The 96 Customs Bonds continued to fall by several jiao. On Thursday, the manipulators resumed their various publicity stunts, triggering another upward surge. The situation became increasingly fierce, and the frenzy was rarely seen in recent times. The authorities did not intervene in the draining of the pond to catch all the fish, so the price rose again by 1 yuan and 7 jiao to 3 yuan and 2 jiao. The others also rose by 1 to 2 jiao to half a yuan. On Friday, the upward surge slowed slightly, and the bulls seemed to be releasing some of their holdings. The near-term bonds fell by 7 jiao, and other bonds improved slightly. On Saturday, the market calmed down, and various bonds showed signs of fatigue, mostly down by 1 to 2 jiao to half a yuan. The result of the week's market prices was that the 23rd Customs Bonds rose by 5 yuan and 9 jiao for the current month and 4 yuan and 9 jiao for the long-term bonds. Other bonds, except for the Golden Long bonds, which improved slightly by 6 jiao, mostly fell by 1 to 2 jiao to 7 to 8 jiao. The total trading volume was 88,325,000 yuan. A comparison of the price changes is listed in the table below: (Unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>US Utility Stocks Set Lowest Record</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 16th), the Wall Street market was quiet and uneven. The characteristic was that the utility stocks set the lowest record since the end of the depression. This is because the government will soon have Congress pass a proposal to abolish utility securities companies and wants various power plants to reduce electricity prices. Before the close, utility stocks stabilized slightly, but the remaining stocks were affected by their negative impact, resulting in a tired trend. Only sugar stocks were an exception, because the forward market for sugar was firm, so they also increased. Wall Street speculators now believe that no matter the outcome of the gold clause case, the market will be difficult to rise. If the verdict is announced on Monday of last week, then the rise could be certain due to the disappearance of uncertainty. The bond market saw mixed ups and downs. The smaller exchanges saw uneven and tired results due to scattered profit-taking. Half-day turnover was 350,000.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: US Cotton Quiet and Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with flat prices. Prices for various months fell by 1 to 3 points. Then, as purchases by the same industry remained healthy and sellers were few, the market stabilized again. However, most outside investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude to await the development of the gold clause case, so trading was scarce and prices did not fluctuate much. The market closed steadily, with spot prices unchanged and futures prices down 1 to 2 points. The British cotton market was firm, with spot prices rising by 3 points and futures prices rising by 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton was purchased by European exporters, but this was offset by bull profit-taking and unfavorable Liverpool news. Pingguoer and Bairuoxi rose by 1 rupee, and Chouxianla rose by 1.5 rupees. Telex</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bairuoxi cotton on the 18th was 248 rupees, a decrease of 0.75 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains: Lower River Rice Prices Rise in the South and Fall in the North</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various gangs (a total of 3,890 shi of goods). Sales were still lackluster. Retail sales were only 300-400 packages. However, as arrivals were scarce, sentiment remained good. The price of thick japonica rice continued to rise by 5 fen, and late rice also increased by several fen. Du Jian [a type of rice] saw neither glory nor disgrace, and foreign japonica rice had no market. A fixed trend of currency conversion has once again led the Japan Market Soybean and Rice Industry Association to hold a joint North-South City meeting, specifically halting exchange rates for one day.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 10 ships arrived from downstream [of the river]. The market was quiet. Domestic [non-Shanghai] and inferior northern japonica rice saw customers eager to sell, and prices fell slightly by 1 jiao. Thin rice from inland regions saw slightly increased deliveries recently, and prices fell slightly by nearly one chi [a unit of measurement]. A shortfall of several fen [Chinese monetary unit] in currency conversion. All other prices remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Hezai)</p>
<p>Clever people often say: "Even a fool can say something clever." In fact, when a fool who can say something clever speaks, he is cleverer than a clever person.</p>
<p>When a clever person knowingly does something wrong or says something wrong and refuses to admit it, he has already become a fool without realizing it.</p>
<p>Only a clever person who knows his mistakes, admits his mistakes, and takes a step forward to gain people's greater trust is a truly clever person.</p>
<p>Clever people often use scolding methods to overwhelm their opponents, but not only do they fail to overwhelm their opponents, but they also make the opponents realize that they are shallow and shameless, and the opponents only ignore them. However, when a clever person sees that the opponent ignores him, he thinks that he has won and is complacent, further demonstrating that the clever person has become a fool.</p>
<h3>Lantern Festival Musings</h3>
<p>— Pian Yue</p>
<p>It is said that eating New Year cake on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month is called "waist-supporting cake." Eating it will keep your waist and legs light and healthy all year round. I think: The Lantern Festival is the end of a year's worth of scenery, from which joy ends and work becomes serious -- but there is a meaning, before the festival, "eat your fill," and after the festival, you must "straighten your back and be a man."</p>
<p>Common habit often says, when depicting the extravagance of drinking and eating, "Han Shi every morning, Lantern Festival every night." Actually, Han Shi Festival is the day before Qingming: According to old customs, on this day, to commemorate Jie Zitui of the Spring and Autumn period for his lofty spirit of avoiding officialdom, every household lights a fire, and every night is as bright as the Lantern Festival, which is indeed lively. If it is said that every morning is as cold as Han Shi Festival, wouldn't it be very miserable! There are many ordinary sayings that are actually the opposite of the original meaning, and even self-contradictory. This is one example.</p>
<p>Zhu Shuzhen, a rare female lyricist, wrote a poem called "Sheng Zha Zi," which was criticized. The poem says: "Last year on the Lantern Festival, the flower market was as picturesque with lights. The moon rose over the willow branches, and people met after dusk. This year on the Lantern Festival, the moon and lights are still the same. But the person from last year is gone, and tears fill my spring shirt!" This poem expresses a story of lost love on a festival. The author is in a detached position. Why must it be arbitrarily concluded that what is described in the work is the author's own story? Why shouldn't a female writer write about lost love, thus involving the issue of her personality? The previous generation's perspective on artistic works was so shallow and distorted! Some people even say that this poem was written by Ouyang Xiu, wanting to clear Shuzhen's name, which is considered to be loyal and kind; but the distortion of that consciousness is the same, and it also groundlessly deprives her of her authorship, which is really unnecessary.</p>
<h3>An Ancient Painting</h3>
<p>— Yan Boliang</p>
<p>People have different personalities, and their hobbies are also different. Like my friend Mr. Huang, he is most fond of playing with calligraphy and painting. He has a rich collection of good works by contemporary celebrities. In his study, there are four-character screens: there are four-painting screens: there are also calligraphy and paintings by celebrities such as Zeng Nongran, Tan Zetan, Huang Xiaochi, Bai Longshanren, Wu Changshuo... Walking into his study, it is as if walking into a calligraphy and painting exhibition room, full of beautiful things.</p>
<p>If he meets someone who shares the same hobby, he even takes the trouble to bring out the ancient paintings collected in the calligraphy and painting box one by one for you to appreciate and criticize, and prepares very exquisite delicacies to keep you to drink and discuss painting. If the visitor praises a few words, he will be so flattered that he regards you as the first confidant in his life. He treats you with great enthusiasm. Mr. Huang has a particularly large number of friends, and he has the demeanor of Little Mengchang.</p>
<p>But he has a quirk. When he sees an ancient painting in someone else's house that he appreciates, he always tries every possible means to take it for himself. One day, he saw an ancient painting in Mr. Chen's house, which was a work by Tang Yin, but the painting was already badly damaged. The Chen family was originally a family of scholars, but due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, their family fortune declined. Mr. Huang asked someone to buy the painting from this family. Unexpectedly, Mr. Chen refused. He then offered one hundred gold to bribe a petty thief to steal the painting and asked the petty thief to leave a note with a price of three hundred yuan. The next morning, Mr. Chen discovered that the ancient painting had been stolen and that there was a price of three hundred yuan, so he just let it go. Now that the Chen family has died out, this matter has only been revealed by him, which can be regarded as an unprecedented and unprecedented elegant affair!</p>
<h3>Triumphant Return</h3>
<p>— Yin Juan</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Ninth Chapter: Unskilled Flattery Leads to Reprimand, Unable to Return Home, Misled by Exaggeration</p>
<p>Although her feet below were not entirely natural, she wore flat-headed shoes like a man. Presumably, inside the cloth socks, she was tightly wrapped with foot-binding cloth. He smiled and said to Madam Hu: It seems that the custom of foot-binding is very strict over there. How come your daughter doesn't have bound feet? Madam Hu said: The county magistrate over there manages it strictly, not allowing our family's girls to bind their feet. Later, when the magistrate was more lenient, her feet couldn't be bound anymore, so she had to give up. I thought it was quite ugly. But since coming to Xi'an, I know it doesn't matter. Aren't there many girls here who don't bind their feet? Yueying heard her mother talking about her feet, and she was very unhappy. She pouted and kept retreating, retreating to the corner of the wall next to the table. Jie Fu said: Madam, I advise you not to plan on being a helper. Think about it, which family would want to hire someone who runs around doing things? Madam Hu said: What does it matter? Whatever work he needs done, I'll do it for him. Whether I kneel or not has nothing to do with him. Jie Fu heard her tone and felt that she didn't quite believe what he said. Just as Easterners hear about kneeling to work as a strange tale, Madam Hu probably thought it was a matter of course. So he smiled at her: I hope that it can suit your wishes. Wouldn't that be even better? Wait here for a while, and I'll ask the tea boy to notify Master Cheng. So he opened his box, took out two business cards, and put them on the table. He took out his handkerchief and gently wiped them for a while. Then, on the back of one of them, he wrote several lines of small characters in neat handwriting: "Respectful greetings to Mr. Zhiqian: Madam Zhu Hu and her daughter are currently at my place, awaiting your news. Please also introduce me to Director Gao." The other one was prepared for Zhiqian to pass on to Director Gao. After writing, he called the tea boy, instructed him with his intentions, and told him to reply immediately. (135)</p>
<h3>Royal Fragrance Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>This is truly a special grace! Originally, for every opera performance, nineteen out of ten programs were designated by the Empress Dowager herself. Not only had we female officials never enjoyed this privilege, but even Guangxu, Jiang Yu, and other princesses and consorts rarely had the opportunity to request operas under the Empress Dowager's imperial decree. This was also a sign of favor, which was not something anyone could hope for casually! If someone had the chance to request an opera, it would be as if their face was covered in gold, and everyone would be very envious of them. However, there are bound to be disadvantages. To put it bluntly, this errand is glorious, but the responsibility on one's shoulders is not light! First, the opera you request must not have any taboo or inappropriate content for the current situation. Second, it must be liked by the Empress Dowager. The first point is relatively easy; you just need to think a little more carefully to avoid any problems! The second point is very difficult! However, if the opera you request fails to arouse her interest, things will be terrible. The shame and embarrassment you will suffer will be ten times greater than the vanity you receive. It's really worrying! Especially in these few days, the Empress Dowager's temper has been very bad, making everyone in the palace feel like they can't get through the day. If she is annoyed again, what can we say? Moreover, we will soon be returning to Beijing, and everyone hopes not to leave any bad impressions before leaving Fengtian. So I felt extra difficulty.</p>
<p>At this moment, it is already impossible for me to decline this opera-requesting errand! Because I was the one who proposed the opera performance just now. If I don't request an opera, who else will? This can truly be said to be hoist by one's own petard! But knowing that regret is already too late, I can only try my best to use my brains, thinking about it for about seven or eight minutes. Fortunately, the Empress Dowager also understands me and knows that I am trying desperately to rack my brains, so she is reluctant to urge me. Later, I actually thought of a very lively opera called "Si Lang Visits His Mother." (246)</p>

<h3>The Muli Kingdom Under the Jurisdiction of Xikang Province</h3>
<p>— Mustard Seed</p>
<p>The Great Kang region of Xikang was formerly the Kang region of Tibet. Although nominally changed to a province, it is situated in a remote western border area, with limited development. Many scholars still lead tribal lives. The Muli Kingdom, located on the slopes of Mount Sailinuli, is one such example.</p>
<p>This small Muli Kingdom borders Yongning in Yunnan to the south and can reach Batang to the north. It possesses a territory of nine thousand square miles, with twenty to thirty thousand subjects. In this vast wilderness, one man reigns supreme, endowed with unparalleled power. The king's daily life and offerings can truly be described as the epitome of human luxury!</p>
<p>It is said that during the early Qing Dynasty when troops were deployed to Tibet, the Tibetan tribes and the Naxi people rose up to resist with all their might. Only the chieftain of the Senri tribe offered food and drink to welcome the Qing army, which pleased the Qing Emperor, who bestowed upon him the title of King. This title has been inherited through generations, down to the present day.</p>
<p>The king's palace is built above the Litan River, with overlapping pavilions and golden brilliance. Situated by the mountains and facing the water, the scenery is unparalleled. The Litan River produces abundant gold sand every year, which only the king is allowed to enjoy. If any subject were to privately mine it, they would be violating a heavenly law and would be immediately executed in front of the royal palace. Therefore, the general populace lives in small huts at the foot of the mountains, in constant fear and trepidation, leading a life of sorrow and misery. How unequal this is!</p>
<p>Within the Muli territory, there are three major temples: Muli, Ku'er, and Weiyate. Each temple is managed by a Lama, who wields significant religious power, second only to the king. The people of the kingdom revere the Lamas as gods. If a family has three sons, they must dedicate two to the temple, leaving only one to continue the family line. The Lamas often wear red robes and yellow hats, as they belong to the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
<p>This secluded little kingdom is surrounded on all sides by towering mountains that reach into the clouds. The local people have exceptionally limited knowledge. All their utensils are very crude. The skulls of the dead are used as food containers, and the leg bones of cows and humans are used as trumpets. Everything indicates that it is an undeveloped tribe.</p>
<h3>Glory After a Dog's Death</h3>
<p>— (Shadow Stays)</p>
<p>In addition to the things I mentioned last time, some dog owners, when their beloved dogs suddenly fall ill, immediately hire famous veterinarians to diagnose and treat the dogs. They are willing to spend a lot of money on medical expenses, even if it is a huge sum. If the dog unfortunately dies, the dog owner will find a site to build a tomb for their beloved dog, and even erect a stone tablet to commemorate it and not forget. This is the glory after a dog's death. This also fully demonstrates that Westerners' love for dogs surpasses everything else!</p>

<h3>Individuality</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianshe</p>
<p>Every evening, five or six friends gather together to chat. Some crack perfumed melon seeds, some smoke Luzon cigarettes, some eat snacks from local companies... In terms of conversation, some talk extensively about women, some discuss social sciences, some tell silly jokes... In short, everyone does what they like. Generally, everyone has their own individuality. Some people wish to ride the long wind and break through ten thousand miles of waves; some are busy with fame, fortune, wealth, and glory; some build small retreats, raise fish, plant bamboo, and play with antiques... There are local old squires in the interior who enjoy snuff, and modern ladies in the city who love to walk their Havana dogs; Mr. A loves martial arts and constantly "shows off his power," while Mr. B is a "gentlemanly type" and always refers to "Su Dongpo" and even "Tolstoy" in his conversations. All of this is a natural expression of individuality, and cannot be forced.</p>
<p>I love to smoke, not that I'm addicted, but I always enjoy doing the whole process - opening the tin, taking out a cigarette, putting it in my mouth, lighting it, inhaling, tapping off the ashes - slowly and leisurely. This is originally due to my individuality. Later, I met a doctor who explained the harms of smoking in detail and earnestly advised me to quit. Perhaps because I was young and lacked a firm will, I immediately followed his advice. But whenever I went to the toilet, had visitors, or attended banquets, I felt extremely bored, lonely, and miserable, even as if I was about to get sick. So, someone said to me: "Friend, don't keep suppressing your individuality. It's painful enough to have a nose and not be allowed to breathe. Smoking may be harmful to your health, but not allowing your individuality to be expressed freely may be even more harmful to your physiology?!" I thought there was some truth to this, so I reopened the smoking ban and restored my individual freedom.</p>
<p>Based on my own experience, I dislike hearing friends say to others: "From tomorrow onwards, I will never do something again (and this is something they love to do), never!" Or, make some oaths. Rather than saying that this is his determination to reform, it is better to say that he is imprisoning his individuality alive, making life feel dull. A pine tree growing in a valley is somewhat pitiful when transplanted into a clay pot. But people often like to do this.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Child</h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>"What to do? It's been three days already. If we don't think of a solution, others will definitely find out." A woman dressed as a rural woman in her twenties, holding a baby who had only been born a few days ago, said tearfully to the man opposite her.</p>
<p>"Solution?" The man's brow was tightly furrowed, staring fixedly at the child in the woman's arms; it was a plump and lovable baby with red and white skin. "It's not like I haven't been trying to think of a solution. Without money, even if we have a solution, it won't work": The man's face was pale.</p>
<p>"No money"! The woman buried her face in the child, sobbing with each breath. "No money... we still have to think... of a solution without money. I can't just watch the clan leader open the ancestral hall door and beat me! You... men... are all heartless..."</p>
<p>"Don't cry! Don't cry! Crying will only make things chaotic! Let's discuss it properly." The man patted the woman's shoulder, his brows even more tightly furrowed. "There is one solution, but... I'm afraid you... won't agree." The man used great effort to suppress the tears in his eyes, and said hesitantly.</p>
<p>"What solution? Tell me quickly! As long as this scandal doesn't spread, anything is fine! I'll follow your idea." The woman raised her head, stopping her rapid sobs. She wiped away her tears with her sleeve, and a little redness appeared on her face. She felt much relieved.</p>
<p>"Alas! It's hard to say, saying it is a great sin"! The man's heart was in torment, hesitating to say what he wanted to say: "Alas! I've been thinking for several days, and the only solution is to throw the child... in the deep pool behind the house... and sink it... with stones... to the bottom of the pool..."</p>
<p>"This..." The woman interrupted him before he could finish.</p>
<p>"What? You... don't want to? You men are so cruel..."!</p>
<p>"If there were another solution, would I need you to say it! Am I willing to make my own child... a water... ghost..." The man shed hot tears of sorrow.</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Night, unknowingly, secretly arrived in the human world; the moonlight was gloomy and pale; the sky was filled with scattered clouds, making the sky seem very low. It was difficult to see many small stars; the earth seemed to be sinking with the darkness.</p>
<p>From the corner of a thatched house, a black shadow seemed to be moving vaguely, and it could be faintly seen heading towards a higher riverbank. The black shadow went from large to small, from small to disappearing into a distant dark atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Splash..." What was it that struck the water with such crisp sound? Who used a huge stone in the water to shatter the silence of the night?</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The woman's head mechanically lifted from the edge of the bed. We could see under the dim light a pair of eyes swollen with tears, watery like rotten peaches. She stood up weakly, because she heard an unusually faint yet piercing sound of knocking on the door.</p>
<p>"How... did it... go..." The woman leaned against the wall, staring at the man standing outside the door, who was pale, as if her whole body was about to collapse. She saw that the little angel with the round face was no longer in the man's arms.</p>
<p>"What... else... is there to ask... It's already sunk... to the bottom of the pool... with the stone..." The man's tears were as big as soybeans, one pressing against the other, forming a string and falling down: He seemed to still hear the "splash" of the water; he seemed to still see the child's smile in a dream at the moment before being thrown in; he seemed to still see the ripples created by the child and the boulder expanding in all directions - a large circle encompassing a small circle in an orderly fashion, one layer pressing tightly against the other, spreading around; he seemed... he couldn't think anymore! He let the tears flow to his nose, the corners of his mouth, his cheeks... He stood like a wooden man, losing consciousness. They felt empty, as if they had lost a part of their lives. The two stared at each other in silence, weeping, until the rooster's cry from the neighbor pulled them back from another train of thought; "I'm leaving! Standing here for too long might make... people see..." The man turned around weakly and walked towards a grove of small trees; the woman's faint sobs melted into the pale morning mist.</p>
<h3>Ode to Spring Grass</h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>The spring grass is again scattered and fluttering by the still stream, the breath of life does not necessarily need to be decorated with the rich colors of red and purple ah - and, who can discover the warmth inside the spring that rests on the sprouts of grass?</p>
<p>In some countless nights, tender branches and buds gradually and stealthily came to adorn the branches, silently, as fleeting as the cloud mountains that appear and disappear in the corner of the sky - the growth of youthful vitality is always a kind of magic, a kind of secret, and a kind of incomprehensible mystery ah.</p>
<p>(Under a broad, open blue sky that makes people feel comfortable, I once heard bright notes of "Il Trovatore" flowing from the bow of a certain violin.</p>
<p>I saw; the small branches used a quick rush to dye the tender green; the stream, like a crowd of people rushing to the rural market at noon, pushed and shoved to flow past, in the middle of which, even a moment of rest was not allowed; and the thin clouds in the sky, did not have a look of "leisurely" ah; quietly drifting across a field, a winding stream, and then disappeared into the invisible distance.</p>
<p>——A busy season ah.</p>
<p>——Indeed, in spring, even the south wind is serious.</p>
<p>Indeed, even the white butterflies, who are the least industrious, also pretend to fly away in a hurry.</p>
<p>——Remember that kind of bright green excitement.</p>
<p>So, I put her into the storage box of imagery; remembering the bright "Il Trovatore", also remembering the spring grass that rested tightly by the stream.)</p>
<p>Gradually, a seed of truth was secretly transplanted into my blood; one morning, one night, it, like the spring grass, also carried vitality, and grew in a mysterious way in people's inadvertence.</p>
<p>Young fellows, don't you have the courage to learn from the grass, to compete and win? Thinking; oneself should have had the attitude of spring grass long ago.</p>
<p>For the sake of anger, and for the sake of shame, finally, longing for the grass of spring, I gritted my teeth, and oneself began to turn the "legend of life," which serves as the great book of the human world.</p>
<p>I bravely opened that terrible ocher-colored cover, enduring to read it day by day, to think about it, to savor it, to face it... it was flashing with a ghostly green flame.</p>
<p>Leisurely mood was forever thrown away, it is frightening for oneself to pass this series of difficult days; so, when the story of life is in progress, even if there is a slight twist, the face will turn pale with fright - at this time, the thoughts will not have the "opium dream" of poetry - life is not poetry, but prose dressed in armor ah.</p>
<p>However, I deeply remember the vigorous heroic posture of the spring grass; so I began to think; in the natural and social world, the taste of survival is not as beautiful as it appears on the outside; but on the contrary, every minute is paying the price of suffering.</p>
<p>Does the flowers and plants growing in the south wind of March, really look like what you "appreciate"? Looking at the full and upright growing people, who can imagine the hardship of their own efforts? Living in this world, it is not enough to simply "appreciate".</p>
<p>The natural world (the spring wind, the grass by the stream?) is not for people to "appreciate"; but for people to "learn" ah.</p>
<p>Just like that, I gradually forgot the leisurely mood of "appreciation" - the spring grass grew year after year, flourishing; to me, it represents a great pain of survival.</p>
<p>(It is time to remember the flowers and plants of the South: The bright notes on the violin, laughter is like the small water in the stream ah.</p>
<p>——Remember that kind of bright green excitement.)</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>I have to apologize, drifting in life, I even forgot her laughter "Il Trovatore."</p>
<p>And now, I am going to look at the spring grass with my heart once again.</p>
<h3>Rural Notes</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>My first contact with the rural environment made me so excited that I forgot that I came here to recuperate. The residence is a friend's house, a three-room tiled house with two courtyards, cleaned with clear windows and clean desks. The host is a friend's seven-year-old son and his talkative old grandmother. When I brought my friend's letter to knock on the door, the little boy seemed to have been waiting for me for a long time, holding his grandmother's hand to open the door. He introduced "This is my grandma" in a very familiar way. The old lady smiled and patted his thick black hair, and ordered him in a maternal tone: "Call him Uncle!" She said to me that when she received his dad's letter, she would ask me several times a day when the Shanghai uncle would come; whenever she heard someone knocking on the door, he would always run in front of Huang Ma to open the door... In fact, the countryside is too quiet, and the child has no companions to play with, so he often clamors to go to Shanghai.</p>
<p>This was at dusk, and I followed the grandparents through a courtyard. The afterglow of the setting sun shone on the corner of the flower wall, which was built of square bricks. On the flower wall were placed two pots of blooming daffodils. Inside the flower wall were spreading dead branches, which seemed to be crabapples or the like. Across from it was a row of large jars, all covered with straw. They were lotuses that emerged from the mud without being stained. There was one that was deeply buried in the ground. I took a step closer and it was my favorite goldfish.</p>
<p>The old lady explained to me: "These goldfish are older than this child. It was that year at the temple fair, his father - haha, his father had not yet married - bought about fifty of them. Now there are less than twenty left!"</p>
<p>"Grandma, when will there be another temple fair? I'll go buy that many."</p>
<p>The child opened his two small palms and made a large circular gesture, while jumping to the side of the jar and counting with his fingers.</p>
<p>Along the high wall, a row of thick hemp ropes was hung, and many dead branches were attached, probably morning glories. I imagined sitting quietly in front of the window of this courtyard in late spring and early summer, burning incense and reading books, and feeling detached from the world.</p>
<p>The three rooms in the back courtyard, with bedrooms on both sides, the center is the ordinary guest hall, which has already been lit with a lamp. It is an old-fashioned safety lamp, which seems to be very precious in the countryside. In the center of the guest hall is a famous painting, because it only depicts two majestic mountain stones, so I think so. Above it is a horizontal plaque that reads "Riyue Shantang". On both walls are four paintings and calligraphy each, with rosewood frames. Eight Immortals table and Grand Tutor chairs are all prepared.</p>
<p>Huang Ma served tea. The old lady said it was their hometown's tea. Drinking it was fragrant and refreshing. The place where China produces tea is indeed worthy of its reputation.</p>
<p>I envied my friend for sitting in a blessed land with beautiful scenery and clear waters, and even more for having a loving old mother and a clever child. He can be worthy of what is said to be "good fortune".</p>
<p>After a while, dinner, apart from a dish of crucian carp, the rest were all vegetables from the field. Homemade coarse vegetables, extremely simple.</p>
<p>I thanked them for their hospitality, and it was fortunate that I was sick, otherwise, running around for food and clothing all year round, where would I have such a leisurely life! But my friend is also making a living in the city, where should I compare myself to him?</p>
<p>My bedroom is on the right side of the guest hall, facing the lotus jar in the courtyard by the window, as if the host had specially arranged it for me because I liked the courtyard. The room is also very elegant, with tables, couches, and bookshelves all available. It turned out to be my friend's study. After saying good night to each other, I wrote in my diary under the kerosene lamp, read a few pages of a book, and when I went to bed, I had already heard the sound of the night watchman's drum.</p>

<h3>Male and Female Actors Whose Good Fortune Began After Fifty (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the old queen of the drama world, is the most admired by the younger generation. She has been a leader in the American drama world for more than fifty years. She said, "If we old people all retire, who will the audience laugh at? Who will play the old aunts? Do you know that most of the jokes in comedies are provided by us? The audience likes to make fun of us old people, and we let them make fun of us. The greatest comfort we feel is the fading of vanity. We don't need to hide our age. But even if we wanted to hide it, we couldn't. Among our colleagues, there are always some petty people who, when they see us, point and say, 'Hey, look, that Mrs. Campbell is still alive. I saw her when I was a child.' Our position as old actors is more stable than that of young actors, because when directors choose us, they believe we are suitable and will not disappoint them. Why should we retire? As long as a person is healthy, it's good to keep working."</p>
<p>Mrs. Campbell first appeared on stage as far back as 1888. In her youth, she was famous for her beauty and voice, and was the only female performer of Shakespearean poetry dramas. Wherever she went, kings of various countries rushed to greet her. After she grew old, she also experienced a period of retirement, but during her retirement, she felt that she had nothing to do and her mind was restless. Although she found some pastimes, she always missed her past glory and wanted to come back again. One day, Irving Thalberg and his wife, Norma Shearer, were in London. They sought her consent to have her play a major role in the film "Riptide." She gladly agreed. She herself didn't expect that anyone would still want her. She said, "After jumping out of my secluded place, I don't want to jump back in again. The happiness I have now is something I haven't tasted in many years."</p>
<p>Helen Westley, who played Mrs. Ruth Cheyney in "The Great Family," probably still remembers her superb performance. She said, "My life has been inseparable from the drama world for forty years. I hope to have another forty years to continue. I think old age is the most interesting time. We enjoy all kinds of freedom. We are also no longer constrained by the passions of youth. We have the ability to introspect, and we see things clearly. Of course, there are many women who are still constrained by emotions in old age. But I believe that is a minority. Ordinary women mature emotionally after the age of fifty. She has self-awareness, and she can analyze everything and everyone around her."</p>
<p>In 1919, the New York Theatre Association was founded. Helen Westley was one of the initiators. She is now also a director of it. The New York Theatre Association is her child, and it is always under her care and nurturing. It could not have reached this point without Helen Westley. Although Helen Westley has a film contract and has to live in Hollywood, she still often goes to New York to inspect the progress of all association affairs.</p>
<p>Sir Guy Standing is the only nobleman among Hollywood actors. He has accumulated sixty years of experience. He said, "Enjoy your life as much as possible, but don't do anything that harms others. If you can do that, just keep living." He also said, "That's right, I'm lucky. I haven't been sick for a single day in my life. A few days ago, I discovered that I never get tired. I feel inexplicably strange. Maybe my body is specially constructed, or maybe I have some strange disease, something to do with glands."</p>
<p>Guy Standing's life has been colorful. When he was nine years old, his uncle gave him a gold pound. He used that gold pound to buy a small boat. He stole a tablecloth from home, made it into a sail, and started sailing with a few young and courageous friends. At the age of fifteen, he began acting, but he was deceived and ended up wandering in a foreign land. Later, he worked on a coal ship and began his sailing career again. He once went to Australia, opened gold mines, and herded sheep, but he was not very successful and still longed for stage life. Later he went to America. When he had nothing to do, he made a living by selling paintings, because he had once studied art as a child. Later, he joined Paramount and achieved great success. However, the European War soon broke out, and he was called back to his country to participate in the war. He expected the war to end in a few months, and he would return to work at Paramount. Unexpectedly, the war continued, and he spent five years of hell on the battlefield. As a result, he received an award from the British Emperor and was given a noble title. But when he returned to America, he was almost empty-handed.</p>
<p>People continue to work when they reach fifty. He started working at sixty. He is now celebrating his sixtieth birthday. His motto is, "Do one or two good deeds every day, find one or two things to be happy about. Every morning when you look in the mirror to shave, you should say to yourself: 'Today is another good day. Thank God for allowing me to enjoy myself as much as possible. Whether you are fifty, sixty, seventy, or eighty, each day has its own use. Each day has its own happiness.'" (The End)</p>
<h3>A Star is Also a Fan</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Before getting into the main text, I want to explain the word Fan. The meaning of Fan is a person who worships or is a "fan" of a certain person or thing. For example, Movie Fan is a movie "fan."</p>
<p>Since stars are individuals, just like they fall in love and get married, it is not surprising that each of them is also a Fan—now let me write down the objects that the major stars worship below to prove that stars are also Fans.</p>
<p>John Barrymore's most beloved and admired person in his life was the famous aviator Lindbergh. John, who was very self-respecting, would forget everything and bow down to Lindbergh as soon as he saw him. Once, in order to meet Lindbergh, he parked his car in front of the hotel where Lindbergh was staying, and waited for about an hour before he saw Lindbergh "slowly calling" out. He immediately jumped out of the car and hurriedly shook hands with Lindbergh. Then he took out his camera, just as he was about to take a picture of Lindbergh, but unfortunately Lindbergh had already gotten into his car and sped away.</p>
<p>If you think about this scene, you must hate Lindbergh for not treating his loyal Fan like this!</p>
<p>Norma Shearer is a Fan of Katherine Hepburn, but I have never met her."</p>
<p>She once said about Katherine, "There are probably few female stars on the screen today who have such a clear personality as her! I have watched all the films she has made. Sometimes I watch the same film two or three times. Yes, I am a very enthusiastic Fan of hers, but I have never met her."</p>
<p>Little Van Dyke and Claudette Colbert are both British playwrights and enthusiastic Fans of Noël Coward, who is famous as the original author of "Cavalcade" and "Bitter Sweet."</p>
<p>Joan Crawford has declared that she is a Fan of Bing Crosby. Joan has almost all of Bing's records and plays them every day, which simply drives the neighbors crazy. Joan, who seems to fear nothing, even trembled like a schoolgirl when she first met Bing.</p>
<p>The most interesting is the idol worshiped by the blonde Gloria Stuart. She has declared to everyone that she has no one to love except Mahatma Gandhi of India.</p>
<p>Hot star Mae West is very patriotic. She said,</p>
<p>"I am exclusively supporting President Roosevelt!"</p>
<p>If I keep writing like this, it will never end, so let me "stop" here!</p>
<h3>Lilian Harvey's Future Plans</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Since leaving Fox, there have been many different speculations about Lilian Harvey's future plans. Some say that she will leave Hollywood from now on, but these are not true.</p>
<p>In fact, when Harvey left Fox, she originally planned to leave Hollywood; so she signed a contract with British International a few weeks ago to shoot three films, stating that the price of each film would be $30,000. But she was not willing to leave Hollywood like this, she always wanted to show Hollywood some of her own achievements; and it just so happened that Columbia Pictures needed a leading actress in a new film called "Once a Gentleman" and invited Harvey to take on the role.</p>
<p>When Lilian read the script of the film, she was filled with moving storylines. And the role she was to play required her to sing two songs and dance a little. So she agreed to them and signed a contract. The film started shooting a week later.</p>
<p>Lilian was so satisfied with the film that after she finished shooting it, she prepared to postpone her trip to England by a few weeks and shoot another new film that she thought was suitable for herself, called "Lady Beware."</p>
<p>After she finishes shooting the film, she will probably go to England to fulfill her new contract. At the same time, she may also marry her fiancé William Frisch?</p>
<p>In any case, Harvey will become Mrs. Frisch sooner or later. She has frankly confessed to reporters, but whether their wedding will be held immediately after she arrives in England or not is still a mystery!</p>

<h3>Film Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Last year, six American directors had the most successful works: W.S. Van Dyke, Frank Capra, Norman Taurog, Roy Del Ruth, George Cukor, and Victor Schertzinger.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Last year, the six most popular American films were: 1. "Little Women" 2. "Imitation of Life" 3. "Judge Priest" 4. "The Gay Divorcee" 5. "One Night of Love" 6. "The Barretts of Wimpole Street."</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>McMillan has signed a contract with Leon Garganoff, who produced the film "War" in Europe, to produce a film.</p>

<p>The new composer Nie Er, after composing the graduation song, has become quite famous. His works, such as "The Highway" and "The Pioneer," are particularly popular and well-known. Moreover, his composition is extremely fast. If he continues to work hard, his future is indeed limitless.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Voice of the Nation (Bordertown) (3)</h3>
<p>— Xue Mei</p>
<p>After Dai'er heard Brooke's words, she asked Johnny, "Did you agree?". Brooke interjected, "Agreed! Hmph, what does the agreement of a rogue lawyer count for? When they start extorting money, you'll never be able to get rid of them for the rest of your life." Johnny couldn't help but raise his fist and punched Brooke in the face. Brooke couldn't withstand the force and fell to the ground. The bailiffs in the court rushed forward to pull Johnny away. Brooke was almost strangled to death by him. Everyone held Johnny, but his anger soon dissipated.</p>
<p>Johnny Lamas committed violence in court. The judge advocated that such a lawyer should have his license revoked. Johnny was therefore disbarred. Disbarred! That was the lawyer's signboard, made by his mother with her wedding ring for him, now taken down. That was five years of hard work, all in vain. That meant he would never become Lincoln. He ran to the priest, who advised him to focus on peace of soul, not to envy vanity, and not to harbor ambition. Johnny Lamas replied, "I know, Father, you mean to tell me to go home and wash cars, or dig ditches, or go back to work in the fields..."</p>
<p>He returned to his old home with three dilapidated rooms. The front room had a roll-top desk, a picture of Lincoln hanging on the wall, and a portrait of the American nation—but missing a piece of the plaque. His mother, seeing him return, took his hand and wept. She called his nickname and said, "Juanito, don't go out again. This is your home. These people are your own kind, they know you and love you." But Johnny said, "Although they love me, they can't give me what I want—as for mentioning home, look at this—what kind of home is this?" His mother said in surprise, "What's wrong with you? Isn't this a good home?" His mother said in surprise, "What's wrong with you? Isn't this a good home? I like it very much." Johnny said, "Okay, Mom, you can like it as much as you want. But I don't like it. And you can't live in this place for long. I want to leave this city and go somewhere else to make some money, big money. Mom, you know, in this world, as long as you have the ability, you can have anything you want. That's what I've recently discovered. If you're poor and lowly, all you can get is to be kicked in the butt, but from now on, I'm going to kick other people's butts."</p>
<p>These words silenced old Mrs. Lamas. That day, Johnny Lamas left Los Angeles and went south. Half a year had passed in a flash. That day, several people were sitting in Charlie Luke's office. Charlie Luke was the owner of the Silver Slipper Saloon. That place was a border town in the endless desert of the US-Mexico border. The Silver Slipper Saloon occupied a large plot of land on the main street of the town. The Silver Slipper Saloon was a bar, a gambling den, and a cheap eatery. Every Saturday night, more than a dozen bartenders ran back and forth, sweating profusely, serving the rough and uncouth patrons. The triggers of the gambling machines and the sound of silver coins clattered loudly. The waiters at the gambling tables were busy collecting and paying money amidst the noise.</p>
<p>In Luke's office, it was still very quiet. Luke sat comfortably, sweat slowly flowing out because he was very fat. There were five people sitting around. Charlie Luke was heard panting and saying, "The Silver Slipper is worth more than three times thirty-five thousand...and, I don't want to sell it." One of the five people said, "Listen, in a month, no one will want to buy it for ten thousand. So, if you don't sell it, we have no choice but to buy a piece of land across the street and open another hotel that's ten times better than yours. By then, your Silver Slipper will become a broken shoe." Just as that person was speaking enthusiastically, a person suddenly walked in from the outside and said, "Friends, our boss says he's not selling!" The person speaking was none other than Johnny Lamas. He was wearing a neat blue serge suit, a snow-white shirt, a bow tie, his hair was combed neatly, and his cheeks were shaved clean. He smiled and walked proudly among them. (To be continued)</p>
