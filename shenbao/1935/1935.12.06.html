<h3>天津大公報被扣之波折</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>本月三日天津大公報著論勉宋哲元無論如何。勿自促國家之分裂。全文婉曲圓到。首段對宋氏處境之困難。深予同情。繼恐當局一時迷誤。提出二種原則。（一）卽「當此千鈞一髮之時。應認定無論如何。必須保障國家之統一。為公為私。為國家。為地方。皆須守此最後軌道。若云非分裂國家不能辦外交。恐世界無此情理也。」（二）若必欲分裂國土。則「當局者須以自身名義。公開負責。萬勿托詞於民意也。」最後該報以為。「為宋司令及其幹部計。宜一方對日懇切說明維繫中國統一之必要。勸其勿走極端。一方對政府申述環境危迫之實情。自决一適應現局之辦法。」唯據前日電云。此文發表後。該報自四日起。已奉天津衛戍司令。部令受停寄處分。</p>
<p>我人統觀此篇文章。處處以民族國家為前提。措辭亦復和平中正。婉轉曲折。今竟為平津衛戍司令部所扣留。是誠令人大惑不解者。按平津一帶。漢奸所發鼓吹自治之荒謬傳單。遍地皆是。當地衛戍司令部旣能袖手而觀。不加干涉。何獨對此促使華北當局注意國家統一之文字。遽爾不能予以容忍。况大公報此篇文字。為純粹的勸告性質。其動機無非深恐當局者迷。陷於謬誤。故特從旁提示。內容並未指定華北當局有何嫌疑。與單純之誹謗。大異其趣。且華北當局。對於此種文字。大可視為『有則改之。無則加勉。』苟其眞正站在代表民族國家利益之立塲者。則其行動。終能大白於國人之前。且為國人所共諒。誠不必採取此種不智之手段也。</p>
<p>我人於此不禁深感言論界免除干涉之切要。當茲國難嚴重之秋。政府欲為堅強有效之應付。首宜使言論界偉量發揮其應有之權威。俾叛國者有所忌憚。謀逆者無所假借。且以喚起全國人士之民族意識與國家觀念。若再不注意此點。則國家前途實深可危懼也。</p>
<p>據最近消息。大公報之被扣事伴。已由交通部明令發放。此一不幸問題。總籌己告解决。我人但願此後不再有類似事伴發生耳。</p>
<h3>英法專家　擬成和議方案　並已向意大利提出　意阿土地掉換甚多</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據可靠消息、英法兩國專家所擬之新和平計劃、已於今日告成、卽由此間意國大使塞魯悌轉致意政府、該計劃內容如下、</p>
<p>（一）意國以阿薩白港及愛立特里士地一條讓與阿比西尼亞、由阿國在該地築一鐵路、經費則由國聯供給、</p>
<p>（二）修正愛立特里疆界、俾以蒂格里省之一部割讓意國、但阿克森及阿杜華須交還阿國、</p>
<p>（三）修正意屬索謀里之疆界、俾以北緯南八度沃加登省之一部割讓與意、</p>
<p>（四）阿比西尼亞其餘土地仍舊獨立、不必如五國委員會之建議歸國際共管、但阿皇得與國聯締結援助條約、法國官方認意相墨索里尼當能接受此項建議、並希望墨氏能髒食此係最後之讓步、法方並鄭重宣稱、雙方交換土地完全係自主行動、該計劃係就廣大之基礎起草、英法兩國意見尚有出入、可在羅馬談判時修正之、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英法專家會商後、已向意國提出早日解决意阿戰爭之新建議、據消息靈通方面消息、此項建議、英法兩國以為可為意阿釋爭之基礎、昨日午後由法總理節伐爾送達駐巴黎意大使塞魯蒂、此舉之目的、蓋顯引逗墨索里尼發表若千意見、俾杲期六日英外相霍爾與賴伐爾會談時、將有所依據、但意國似未必滿意之答覆、蓋賴伐爾雖曾切實聲明、此為十八國委員會開會考慮禁油以前所能提出之最後建議、惟據羅馬來電、殊難望墨索里尼接受之也、衆信此項建議乃循以前歷次談話之方針而製定者、其中含有寬國以伊利特里東南之阿薩白港連同土地一隅割予阿國、在此土地上可建造鐵路一條、由阿京通至阿薩白、而歸國聯監管、意國並將阿克森聖城與阿杜華交還阿國、阿國則以南部沃迦登全省土地割讓意國、並准將蒂格里與哈拉爾兩省邊界作重要之修正、又前十五國委員會建議、以阿國本部許多經濟利益給予意國、今復述及、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）意國駐英大使格蘭第本日曾與外部次官汪西泰會晤、該國駐法大使賽呂蒂亦與法國賴伐爾總理會談、此間人士對於此兩事、均極重視、傳聞賽呂蒂係代表意相墨索里尼向賴伐爾提出重要文件云、（四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）此間迭接倫敦及羅馬方面消息、意阿問題現正由英法意三國政府進行談判、以謀和平解决、國聯會方面主管人員、以為在最近所作談判中、各方面態度確已較為軟化、惟因缺乏準確消息、故談話前途若何、殊難推斷、至目前為止、十八國小組委員會仍將於十二月十一一日開會、討論禁運煤油問題、延緩開會一層、並未考慮及之、惟在十二月十二日以前、談判倘已具體化、和議基礎倘已為意阿雙方所接受、則十八國小組委員會或將延緩開會、亦未可知、苟然、則當立卽召集國聯會行政院特別會議、而以意阿和議草案、提交五國委員會、加以審查、蓋解决意阿爭端之五國委員會、迄今並未解散也、（四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>霍爾與墨索里尼　約期會晤不確　英法外長將會於巴黎</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據可靠消息、此次外相霍爾赴瑞土養疴、順道在巴黎小作勾留、與法國總理兼外長賴伐爾晤談後、將於耶穌聖誕節或新年前後、與意相墨索里尼在瑞士覿面會談云、按墨索里尼自秉政以還、僅曾出國三次、第一次一九二二年十二月、參加倫敦會議、討論德國賠償問題、會議旣無結果、而法國乃有出兵佔領魯爾區域之舉、第二次為一九二三年、赴瑞士洛桑城、參加希土和議、締訂洛桑和約、第三次在一九二五年、為締訂羅卡諾公約、赴瑞士羅卡諾城、如此次赴瑞士會晤英國外相、則為第四次出國矣、（五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）官方頃否認外相霍爾將在瑞士境內會晤意相墨索里尼之說、又霍爾偕其夫人及私人秘書一人、大約將於明日午後飛往巴黎、與法國總理賴伐爾舉行會見、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英法兩國意見仍多參差、當俟本星期末、霍爾外相與法國賴伐爾總理兼外長任巴黎會晤時、再加商討、英國贊成以阿國北部阿杜亞城與阿伽姆區域劃歸意國、或將阿國唐拿凱區域與意屬伊里特里亞之界綫酌加修改至於南部沃加丹區域本係荒瘠沙澳地帶亦可併入意屬索謀里蘭、又所擬意國墾殖地帶之界綫、則（一）東以沃加丹區域與英屬索謀里蘭間現有界綫卽至恩陀幾費普地方以東為界、（二）西以查那湖至英屬怯尼亞之南北直綫為界、在上述界綫內、意國得移殖人民、從事墾種、經營商務、推該地帶之政治主權、則仍當歸阿國皇帝保持、至意國則當在伊里特里亞劃出一條通紅海之道路、連同亞薩勃港、畀予阿國、作為交換、此在法國、則主張以蒂格里全省、卽現由意軍佔領之區域劃歸意國、唐拿凱區域與伊里特里亞間之界綫、亦當予以較重要之修改、又南方沃加丹區域、自亦當割讓意國、至於准許意國墾殖地帶之界綫、則法國意見與英國相同、惟以為該地帶之政治主權、雖仍屬諸阿皇、但其行政權、則應歸意國行使、由意國指派副總督一人、駐剳阿京、此項計畫、成功與否、當視亞薩勃港能否割予阿國以為斷云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）昨日午後、意國大使賽呂蒂拜訪賴伐爾總理兼外長、會談歷半小時、據一般人相信、此項會晤、雖係出於賽呂蒂之意、但賴伐爾當已乘機以英法兩國專家談話結果所擬提出解决意阿爭端之建議、通知意國大使、關於此項談話情形、最近數日、曾有消息傳往羅馬、據聞英法兩國專家意見現已趨於接近、惟尚未完全成立協定、至專家工作、則係以意阿兩國交換土地辦法為基礎、蓋以此項方式、較易草擬、足使國聯會感覺滿意、而意阿兩國亦有直接成立妥恊之可能也、大抵九月間國聯會行政院五國委員會所提建議、大部分已為英法專家所撇開、而主張阿國應完全保持獨立、在意阿爭端未完全解决之前、並不向各國要求在國聯會監督之下、予以財政與經濟上之援助、至所擬士地交換辦法、則大概係由意大利在伊里特里亞劃出一條通紅海之甬道、連同亞薩勃港、畀予阿國、而由阿國以北部蒂格里省與法屬索謀里蘭間士地一塊、割讓意國、阿克遜聖城雖在割讓地帶之內、但仍歸阿國所有、而瑪加勒城、則亦劃出該地帶之外、至阿國南部、則在北韓八度及東經三十八或四十度以內之土地、連同沃加丹區、均以畀予意國、此外英國方面贊成以東經四十度為止云、據此間若干人士觀察、墨索里尼雖對八月間艾登之所提議、未予贊同、但對上項辦法、或願加以討論、消息靈通方面相信、上述計畫、當使本星期六日霍爾外相與賴伐爾談話具有更廣大之可能性、且不論意阿兩國如何態度、要足使國際時局為之緩和云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英艦離地中海　說者謂對意友好姿勢</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日據當局宣稱、駐直布羅陀之英軍艦現開出游弋而赴海峽界內大西洋中之某地點、說者謂此舉乃對意之友好姿勢、倫敦消息靈通各界指此說為不確、蓋艦隊每遇操演時、輒作此游弋也、諸艦雖開離地中海、但决不遠距直布羅陀海峽、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>直布羅陀　停泊此間之英國本部艦隊、頃於晨間離此、駛往距岸較遠之洋面、舉行演習、預定於本週杪開回此間、又英國最大巡洋艦霍特號及雷囊號兩艘、亦已開往葡萄牙屬麥台爾島及其他港口、預定於本月十八日駛回直布羅陀、另據消息靈通人士表示、霍特號係開往麥台爾島、雷囊號則開往菲洲法屬丹港、吉爾港其他驅逐艦多艘則由西班牙呼埃伐港駛出、舉行演習、幷謂此次演習、絕無政治意義、且與阿比西尼亞事伴完全無關、英國海軍部之意、以為本部艦隊之停泊直布羅陀者、未便任其久駐不動、故有使之駛往洋面演習之舉、因此演習地點、當在距直布羅陀港二十英里之內、俾必要時、可於數小時內、集中該港云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅馬方面亦闢謠</h3>
<p>（羅馬）近有官傳前方戰事不利消息者、政府頃採嚴厲措置以懲處之、法西斯機關報意大利人民報、並為此事發表警告云、「凡官傳前方不利消患者、不論何人、警察當局將嚴加懲處、不稍寬貸、此項消息均係參加制裁國家方面之人士傳播、凡我國民、務宜勿予置信」云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）專家今日聲稱、目前國際均勢、已為菲洲戰爭所擾亂、日來世界視綫、復集中於行將開幕之五強海軍會議、數星期來、世界海軍強國向所公認之比較實力、已起變化、因將來計算海軍力量之時、當更須注意各國之空軍力量也、意阿衝突所引起之英意緊張局勢、已表示空軍之力量可使英國之地中海艦隊、至少一部份不能似往日銅牆鐵壁之馬爾泰作為活動之根據、而須退據亞力山大里亞及直布羅陀、此事大可注意、此足以表示海軍將領、深恐轟炸機之威力也、再菲洲戰爭、已使英國之海軍力量不能兼顧歐洲以外之事、而日本之比較實力、卽當然增加、因日本在東亞沿海已可毫無顧忌矣、此次海軍會議、係根據一九三二年二月六日華盛頓條約之規定、由英國政府召集、條約中訂明、凡有一國通知廢棄、卽須召集會議、重新討論、日本政府已於一九三四年二月六日、通知各簽字國、根據條約第二十三欵之規定、聲明擬於一九三六年十二月三十一日終止該約、故英國復邀請美日法意四國、至倫敦開會、此間海軍專家咸稱、此次會議如不能議决將來各國艦隊之大小問題、則國際間之軍備競爭、及戰爭之危險或將接踵而起、現在會期已近、觀察者對於會議前途、頗多懷疑、英日兩國皆已表示不滿於現有之限制、卽華府及倫敦二約、而華盛頓方面則仍堅主五、五·三比率、倫敦條約雖未减少各國主力艦之總噸位、然曾限制艦數、故數年來尚無巨艦之建造、如此後會議不能成立新約、則行見一艦之費、需欵二千萬元美金者、復將增加矣、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本出席倫敦海軍會議之代表今日表示、政治問題與海軍問題不能分離、彼等之立塲、係根據東京外務省之聲明、卽在對於世界大勢之政治問題未能完全諒解之前、海軍協定無法成立、日本代表今日以私人資格發言、謂本屆會議中、彼等於一切政治問題未能解决之前、並不準備討論戰艦之大小問題、至於彼等之所以探取此項立塲、則因華盛頓條約中之海軍比率問題、與日本及其他國家之安全及聲譽、皆有不可分離之關係也、日本方面發表此項意見之後、外交專家咸信此次會議之希望、已經完全消滅矣、（四日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）外傳日本永野全權在倫敦聲明軍縮方針、謂廢止潛水艦並非反對、並歡迎締結太平洋不侵略條約云云、然此與日本方針完全背馳、恐係出於誤傳、故今日外務省發表杏認之談話如下、日本全權團之發表聲明、須仰外務省及海軍方面之指示、但迄今並無請訓、故不信有此聲明發表、廢止潛水艦係與日本政府之軍縮方針背道而馳、故不信有期言明、潛水艦乃防禦武器、故在劣勢海軍國、可經濟的達成軍備目的、因此各國若不同意全廢攻擊武器、日本亦絕對不贊成廢止潛水艦、太平洋不侵略協定、欲憑集團組織確保太平洋之安全保障、有背東亞主義之日本外交方針、故非在協議遠東不威脅不侵略恊定之後、則日本不恊議海軍問題、實係事實無根、至於華府條約第十九條限制太平洋設防條項之存在、若由關係國提議、日本亦準備應之但不積極提議、（五日電通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）出席倫敦海軍會議日本首席代表海軍大將永野、頃向哈瓦斯社訪員發表談話、內稱、「日本政策之主要基礎、厥惟安全而已、吾人主張安全必須平等、故認海軍之對等權利、應為成立一切協定之先决條件、按照吾人之見解、海軍對等權、實卽等於保證吾國安全之權利、要之、吾國應付環境之需要範圍、惟吾國海軍部方有權决定之」云、訪員繼問、如海軍會議承認日本之對等權、則對於限制總噸數之問題、日本抱何種意見、永野大將答謂、「此層吾人現正開始加以討論、對於總噸數之最高限額、吾人自當以妥恊精神興各國代表團從長計議」云、述及海軍之質的限制、永野則謂、「日本之態度若何、當俟日本之第一要求（卽指海軍對等權）及總噸數問題如何解决、以為斷、」詢以外傳海軍會議將討論太平洋島屬設防問題、究有其事否、永野則謂、他國代表團倘提出此項問題、則日本亦不反對加以討論云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英法意三國對阿角逐的史實　（續）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>俗語說道：「最後笑的人笑得最好；」賽跑的勝利者，也會失其資格。阿兵駐紮在沙磧低地，糧食全罄，再加大水盛漲，因此丟了國旗，趕快退走。馬向德還死守不去，但是已無大軍為助。吉靑納在痛創擋住去路的回教徒以後，這時已率領得勝兵士，浩浩蕩蕩向法旭達前進，法政府便命強拗的馬向德見機而退。於是英吉利國旗便堅在法旭達，直至今日，還臨風招颳，從好望角到開羅，都是英國威權所及之地。法國便降居東菲次要的地位。</p>
<p>在這時中間，法國曾以來福搶接濟阿皇米尼里克，助他殲滅從北方攻入阿境的意軍一枝。一八九七年，法國又和阿國締結友交協定，規定將吉波蒂作為阿比西尼亞帝國的正式口岸。新鐵道築成以後，比歐洲任何國除俄國外為大的一地的商業，將全數輸送到一個法人口岸。米尼里克此舉，不營把他國家的一個鑰匙，贈給巴黎。並且法國商人可在阿國享受優惠的待遇，此外法國還得到其他特權，新路工程，於是開始。這些都是吉靑納進抵法旭達以前的事，吉靑納到了法旭達以後英國的威望，卽在東菲增高，英國駐阿京代表，便十分活動　。</p>
<p>一九〇二年，英國和米尼里克訂成關於利用藍尼羅河河水的優惠條約，甚至得到由英殖民地齊拉港築造鐵道，經過阿境，通至蘇丹的權利。這是法人鐵道中問的一個至可怕的大障礙，使吉波蒂似乎已不成其為阿比西尼亞的正門。同時，法國公司遭遇失敗，鐵道工程便停止了。後來法國和其他最有關係的兩大國商得諒解，許法國造路至阿京為止，但不得逼近尼羅河，許英國利用太那湖和藍尼羅河的水源，許意國在阿國大部分獨享經濟讓與權，並得築造月芽形的鐵道，由北面伊利特里經過阿國西部，而達南面意屬索瑪里倫。日後如阿比西尼亞帝國分裂，每國得在畫定的勢力範圍以內為所欲為，起初阿皇米尼里克對於這個條約，毫無所知，從未加以承認。這約雖成為阿比西尼亞和列強間關係的基礎，但仍然是一種秘密文伴。</p>
<p>一九〇八年，米尼里克雖然極不願意，終和法國訂定關於鐵道工程的條約。九年之後，經過了極端艱苦，吉波蒂到阿京鐵道幸告功成。這個事業，現屬於法蘭西共和國，獲利很豐。這是一百年來國際間鈎心鬥角的唯一眞實結果，這路現在運載阿國和外國間的貿易品百分之八十，輸送出入阿國的旅客百分之九十五。其股份共三萬四千股，本年初曾以二千五百股讓給意國。</p>
<p>一九一五年法英兩國在倫救締結秘密條約，担保意國，如加入世界大戰協約國方面，許她在阿國享受豐富的利益。法國從未踐行約言，但在本年初曾以幾種瑣細的土地讓與權給與意國，似乎許意國在阿有自由行動之權。</p>
<p>一九二三年，國聯討論阿國加入問題時，法國很替阿國說話。總而言之，列強沒有一國像法國如此援助阿國的。（譯ChristianScienceMonitor報所載R.H.Markham氏論文）</p>

<h3>我國的科學研究事業　（續）</h3>
<p>— 中央研究院總幹事丁文江</p>
<p>（十一月二十六日對垂國中等學校學生演講）</p>
<p>第一地質調查所是一個極窮的機關。民國五年開始組織的時候，預定是十二寓元一年。從民國五年到民國十五年，每年實在收到的經費，平均不過五萬元。最少的時候，不到三萬元·到至今政府所給的經費也還不過七萬二千元。當事人的困難，可以想見。但是正是因為窮的緣故，所以免去了許多政治上的干涉。因為經費少所以薪水也比較的少，而且田野工作，是件極古的事。很早的時候，大家都知道地質調查所工作極其緊張，而待遇極薄。起初還有人向所長亂薦條子，到以後不是對於地質眞有興趣的人，提到地質調查所就搖頭不願意加入。因此在政治很混濁濁環境之下，地質調查所居然能够沒有受他的傳染。民國以來，任何政府機關的長官都常常更換。惟有地質調查所始終祇有過兩個所長。現在的所長翁文灝先生在職己經十四年。管轄他的農商部實業部部長和代理部長的人，却更換了二十個以上！因為窮所以能不養閒人，所以所長能久於其事。這是地質調查所成功的第一個條件。</p>
<p>第二從開辦以來，地質調查所即注意於實用問題。不但他們發現了許多新礦，而且調查地質礦產的人，隨時隨地帮開確的人忙。不論是測量礦區圖，或是地質圖，化騐礦質，决定打鑽地點，祇要是眞正辦礦的人，地質調查所都願意帮他工作，帮他計劃，個人與機關都不受任何的酬報。所以礦業界的人，部知道地質調查所是他們的朋友。遇有政治上的困難，大家出來替他說話。而且這二十年中，私人捐助他的欵項，將近廿萬。所有地質調查所在北平的圖書館，解剖室，古生物與燃料研究室，地震室，都是用私人的捐欵來建築的。政府的研究機關，而得到大量的私人捐助，恐怕祇有地質調查所一個。</p>
<p>第三地質調查所能够充分的利用外國學者。近幾年來，許多研究科學的靑年，受了民族主義的影響，往往不願和外國人合作，或受外國人指導。不知道這是大錯誤的。科學原來是西歐的產物。歐美人研究科學，至少已經有一百五十年的歷史。我們纔不過二十年。人家當然比我們高明，我們當然要與外國人合作，受外國人指導，方始有趕上人家的希望。反過來說，有許多政府機關　用外國人，往往不能用他，而為他所用。不知道外國人雖然比我們高明，但是他不會說中國話，不知道中國的需要。沒有相當的中國人作領袖來指揮他，不但他不能盡其所長，而且還要誤事。况且一般的外國科學家雖然比我們高明，但是能够指導我們而又能到中國來的人，却是少數。地質調查所所聘用的外國人，都是頭等人才，都在長官指揮之下，與他的中國同事合作，所以纔能收相當的效果。</p>
<p>上面所說的幾個條件，雖然重要，若是沒有一個很犧牲自己的所長，地質調查所也决不能有今日的成功。當民國十四年到民國十六年地質調查所最困苦的時候，翁文灝先生完全不要薪水。二十三年前，所長是薦任官，但是翁先生因為不願意離開地質調查所，所以不願意作淸華的校長和教育部部長。目前所長改為簡任官了，而翁先生拿的是簡任官最低的俸給。這種精神，當然傳播到全所職員心裏面。許多人寗可少拿薪水，不願童離開地質調查所。作田野工作的人，把吃辛苦，冒危險，當作極平常的事。民國十八年，趙亞會先生奉派往四川到雲南。寗可在昭通被土匪打死，不肯放棄原來調查的計劃。民國十九年冬天，王恒升先生在黑龍江邊界被俄國的軍隊當作奸細捉了去，關在西比利亞監獄裏，喝凉水吃黑麵包十八天，兩次幾乎槍斃。等到他被放出來，到了滿州里，他照常的作他的田野工作。一直等到預定的計劉實行了，方始回去。這種精神，是我們民族復興的根本。我願意靑年人個個都知道這種事實，個個都學他們的榜樣。</p>
<p>科學研究機關繼地質調查所成立的，是科學社的生物研究所。科學社是我國留美學生所組織於民國四年在美國綺色佳城成立，民國七年辦事機關從美國遷到本國來。當時的事業是編印所謂一科學」是一種通俗的雜誌。民國九年秉志先生從美國回來擔担東南大學的動物學教授。秉先生是科學社的發起人，並且是第一屆理事之一。他是最熱心研究的人，但是東南大學原本是高等師範改的，不但儀器設備很簡單，房屋很窄小，而且教課很繁重，當局對於研究的工作也沒有提倡的能力。於是秉先生就想利用科學社來做研究生物學的根據。恰巧財政部把南京成賢街文德里的官產撥給科學社做社所。除去了辦公室，圖書館之外，還有幾間餘屋。秉先生就聯合他的朋友東南大學植物學教授胡先繡先生提議在科學社裏面組織一僩生物研究所。於十一年成立，秉先生做所長，胡先生做研究員。當時生物研究所只佔得兩間小房子，每年的經費只有二百四十元！秉先生胡先生不但不支薪水，而且同他們的朋友陳煥席，陳楨兩先生各人把他們自己的書籍拿了出來，放在科學社作為公共的圖書館。所必辦的儀器藥品都從東南大學借得來使用。日裏忙了教書，沒有時間，晚上吃了晚飯以後再跑到所裏來工作。十二年又向科學社要得兩間大點的房子，做陳列室。這一年的秋天，江蘇省政府决定一個月補助他們三百元。從十二年到十五年這三年之中，科學社生物研究所的經費一年一共不過三千八百四十元，但是秉先生和他的朋友們分別擔任採集，陳列，研究各項的工作，先後發表了八篇論文。他們的工作都是夜裏和夏天做的，因為別的時閒都忙了教書。我還記得十三年夏天，科學社在南京社所開十週年紀念大會。那一天天氣酷熱，屋子裏坐不住，會裏一切程序都在露天舉行的。吃了晚飯以後，舉行各種游戲和娛樂，我到處找秉先生，看不見他的影子。到後來纔知道他和他的助手都藏在樓上抱着他們的顯微鏡呢！不久江浙戰爭起來，南京屢次發生恐慌，但是秉先生們不但沒有搬家逃難，而且每天照常工作，沒有間斷過。</p>
<p>十五年以後一直到現在，科學社受了中華教育文化基金的補助，經費比以前漸漸的寬裕了。補助費第一次是一萬五千元一年，目前是四萬六千，最多的時候也不過五萬。而生物研究所一面常川派人在野外採集標本，一面建築新屋，增加設備。現在儀器，陳列室已經粗備，出版的論文有九十多篇，藏書幾千餘冊，標本五萬多件。用欵的經濟，比一般政府機關眞可謂有「天淵之別」了。</p>
<p>科學社生物研究所的工作，大部分注重於分類。近幾年來頗有人責備秉先生，以為他的工作太不時髦了，太狹隘了。這種批評是不公道的，不錯，在歐美各國動植物的分類學是已經過時的了。然而這是因為他們已經把本國的動植物的種類分佈，在這二百年中弄明白了。並不是分類學不重要。我們則剛剛着手。譬如與動植物有實用關係的莫過於漁業，農業，和森林。假如我們連有幾種魚，幾種樹，幾種害蟲，都說不明白，如何能講到應用，高談深造呢？秉先生做分類的工作，在他個人是一種犧牲，因為他本來是學體形學Morphology的，他個人的興趣原不在分類的。動植物學範圍太廣泛了。要把各種研究工作都包括在一個機關裏面，本來是不可能的。何况他的經費，只有四萬六千元一年呢！</p>
<p>我開始已經說過，中國現在的研究機關漸漸增多起來了。我所以單講地質調查所和科學社的生物研究所的原因，一來是時間不够，二來是我個人對於這兩個機關特別的知道淸楚，尤其是他們兩個都經過艱難困苦的創造。我不是為我的朋友來「標榜』，他們的成績具在，用不着任何人標榜的。我是要使有志的靑年，知道這種事實，一聞風興起」。我常常對中年人說：現代的靑年比我們高明。我也要對靑年說：社會不是萬惡的，有幾個前輩的做人治學的精神是足以做靑年人的模範的。</p>

<h3>國貨事業近況</h3>
<p>貨價提高者甚多惟搪磁等不漲價　南洋一帶國貨運往數量逐月增加</p>
<p>中央社云、國貨業最近營業確况、頗為一班人士所注意、中央社記者、以此往訪熟悉國貨業之潘仰堯、於四行準備庫、據談該業情形甚詳、分誌如次、</p>
<p>較小工廠不能合作　自上月以來、國貨業因原料價值飛漲、致銷數略見停滯、因國貨原料、有一部分屬於舶來品、價格暴漲、平均達百分之廿、五金之類、竟漲至原價三分之一、貨品成本旣高、買價當然亦隨之高漲、際此購買力薄弱之時、銷路於是滯呆、存貨堆積、則資本不能流通、廉價傾銷、又虧蝕資本、所以目下情形、稍感困難、且該同業、又不能合作、自相競爭、最近市上又發現資本極小之國貨工塲、組製濫造、廉價出售、遂使各廠商貨品銷路、更形不振、但資本較大廠商、己明白同業合作之必要、進行合作者亦甚多、</p>
<p>外商計議內地設廠　國貨業前途最感困難之處、厥惟外商、計議在我國內地、設立工廠、因財政部修改進出口稅率後、若干貨品、進口稅率提高不少、外商感於貨品在華推銷發生影響、於是計議在我國內地設廠、出貨推銷、較可獲利、是項計議、正在着手進行、設或一旦實現、則國貨業產銷方面、勢必受到極大影響、所以國貨業對此極為關心、</p>
<p>海外各地推銷國貨　國貨原料暴漲後、貨價因成本關係、提高者甚多、但一部份貨品、如搪瓷等等、仍不漲價、所以近來銷數甚旺、國貨廠商最近對銷路方面、增聘人才、紛向內地推銷、雖交通不便之邊陲省份、均有大批貨品、陸續運往銷售、即海外各地、亦已漸謀發展、如南洋一帶、國貨運往數量、逐月增高、此實一良好現象云、</p>

<h3>公共租界佔計房捐　工部局發表正式聲明</h3>
<p>原有征捐方針並未放棄變更　另行估價征捐限於特殊情形　答覆納稅華人提出之原則　不爭房房估委會之法律地位</p>
<p>公共納稅華人會曾於十月三十日發表、關於工部局估租收捐之意見一文、遍載本埠各報、其中主要論列之點、即謂工部局放棄其依據房票所載房租數目、以為徵收之房捐之慣例、而改用估價收捐之方法云云、工部局當局對此、極為重視、特公佈重要宣言、並剴切向納稅人聲明、工部局原有徵收房捐方針、旣無改弦易轍之舉、復乏變更成法之議、而估便收捐之根據、其施用於今日者、亦與行於六十五載以前者毫無二政、夫為捐稅負担平衡起見、工部局遂有估計房租之權、其最初之根據、即為一八五四年之地產章程、再則估計之樺、無論自置產業、或租用房屋、審情處理、而俱施用、可無疑義、蓋工部局辦理此事、認定之原則、耶房租雖可作為捐稅價值之書面證據、但有時亦不足悉以為憑、自十八六七年以來、各法院對於此點、屢加覆覈、僉稱確當、其判語中有云、「雙方爭辯各節、詳加審核之餘、深覺工部局為徽捐起見、確有於實在房租之外、另行估計租價之權。」等語、當然、一地捐稅之分配、其最適當而普遍應用之根據、莫如租用之房屋、因而審視房屋之種類、擬定活動之標準、俾納稅之多寡、即可由房屋價值之高下、而自動伸縮、以求平衡之道、此種辦法之妥善、實為舉世所公認、毋庸再為贅論、惟一地之捐稅、既以均衡於一般市民為　的、則一屋租金之價格、自須與其他房屋、有相當公正之比擬、夫此豈一紙房票、即可認為至公無弊之標準者、故公共租界工部局之市政總捐估收之數目、即以每屋每年之租價為標準、此等房屋、其房主除外部修茸之外、則無其他負擔、而其房票之書面價值之經工部局認為足以代表租價、而用為徵收總捐之標準者、實估界內房屋之絕對多數、但如上文所云、遇有房票不足為憑之時、工部局為求市民負担平衡起見、遂不得不另行佔計其租價、以同等地段·同類房屋·為標準、以計其適當之捐稅、惟此種事件、在界內全部房屋之中、僅佔微渺之少數、面前此納稅華人會之所爭論者、亦即此耳、茲復試將此類房票不足悉憑之事件、臚列如下、</p>
<p>（一）房主與房客之間、或因事業之連屬、或因親屬之情誼、房金因而减收者、</p>
<p>（二）房客原租房屋、租金尚屬公允、但因房客事後自動增加永久性質之裝修增築、致該屋租價增加甚鉅、</p>
<p>（三）房客不付房金之全部、而照部份改作金錢上之貼補者、因此推實租金、即須以票面房租及每年金錢補償之總數合計之、</p>
<p>（四）除去經濟原因之外、房主因房客係房主之僱傭、或間接為房主服役効勞、而免去其租金之一部份者、</p>
<p>（五）房主房客、通同作弊、揑造偽房票、以圖偷漏總捐者、</p>
<p>由此種種、可見工部局遇有房票數目與房租價值懸殊之時、有不得不以類比之方法、為徵稅根據之苦衷、且此種辦法、於維護大多數納稅人之利益、亦屬至要、因一般市民、固己按照確實房屋租價、完納其份內賦稅之全部也、</p>
<p>再則復如納稅華人會發表意見中所云、「工部局利用地產章程己死之條文、謀事實上捐稅之增收」、又謂、「譬如百元之房租以百分之十四捐率計算、每月應納稅捐十四元、如高估為百五十元、則總捐須為二十一元、是捐率未增、而總捐己增一倍半、等於增加稅率、由百分之十四為百分之二十一」、云云、工部局於此、不得不指正者、即假使有人於納捐時、出示房票、載明房金每月一百元、但其房租價值、明知其為每月一百五十元、倘工部局聽其照百元納稅、則彼所付之稅率、將不及百分之十四、而為百分之九零三如是、則漏付之稅、勢將均攤於其他照定納稅諾市民之身、於情於理、豈得謂為公允、</p>
<p>由此以觀、可見納稅華人會所云、工部局放棄其依據房票所載房租數目、為收捐根據之慣例、而改用估價收捐之方法等語、誠屬誤解、蓋工部局對於徵稅之原則及成法、旣未放棄、亦未變更也、工部局近年所已為者、不過對於房客所宣示之房租、審核稍精、調查較密、致社會中少數有所企圖之份子、難以遂其私願耳、</p>
<p>再則、公共租界以外、上海市政府行政區內所行徵收房捐之辦法、亦與上述者相同、查上海市徵收房捐規則第十條載明、一租價之確定、以最近兩月之房票或租摺為憑、如有房屋與租價過相懸殊者、應另為估定租價徵收房捐、其自置房屋自行居住者、由財政局派員估定之、估定租價如有爭執時、由房產估價委員會評定之」、（見民國二十三年十月十日上海市政府公報）、上文所言佔價委員會、係以市政府各局職員六人及市政府某委員會委員三人組織之、至納稅華人會意見書中所提出之三原則、茲特與以簡單之答復如下、</p>
<p>原則「工部局對於有實亦房租之房屋、應依實在房租徵捐、對於己產自用者、得用估租徵捐」、此節若加以應用、恐於捐稅之平衡有碍、且與法庭判决相反、</p>
<p>原則二「部局設立所謂房租估價委員會、於法無據、依法不承認其有聽訴之權、其判書對外絕無拘束力」、按估價徵捐、其權屬於工部局、但該局並非技術團體、不得不延聘專門人才、以備顧問、故就委員會之法律地位、局方並不加以爭論、</p>
<p>原則三「工部局不得任意加捐、除納稅人有同意變更捐率外、納稅人絕對有權拒付工部局法外所增之捐稅」、查訂定捐率之權、雖操之於納稅人、但工部局職司所在、應力求捐稅之平衡分配、且此種辦法之結果、係减輕一般納稅人之平均負擔、而非加以提高也、</p>

<p>徧體鱗傷盡屬指甲抓傷痕跡、傷勢異常沈重、乃留院診治、詎至昨晨三時四十、將其三歲親生女孩榮弟毆打重傷身死、昨又發生同樣之案、所異於前者、則為非五分、來發因傷過重無法救治、死於病院之內、經捕房車送騐屍所候騐、一面於昨晨九時、將王曹氏解送第一特區法院形八庭、捕房律師張天蔭依刑法二百八十六條第一項提起公訴詰之王曹氏、否認虐待、謂來發因患驚瘋病甚劇、故以推經法用雞蛋等在孩</p>
<p>全身推揑使驚吊出、指甲傷痕、卽因此而來、求鑒、並延范剛律師辯護、捕房張律師以來發之死因、究為毆傷、抑係患病、應候檢察官檢騐後、方能判斷、故請求改期訊理、劉毓桂推事核稟、遂諭王曹氏還押、改期再訊、旋由特一法院檢察官郭偉</p>

<h3>上海棉布業概況（續）</h3>
<p>中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之四）</p>
<p>六　銷售狀況</p>
<p>上海為吾國最大之棉布市塲，棉布銷路，遍及國內各埠及南洋一帶，經營斯業者，分字號門莊二種。字號以躉售為主·門莊以零售為宗·有單獨分營者，亦有聯合兼營者，當該業之全盛時代（民十八至民二十），大小莊號共達千家左右。每年營業總額約達一萬萬元以上。二十一年以後，東北已成淸一色之日貨市塲·華北各省，因靑·津等埠，日貨活動甚力，僅有零星去胃。華南如粵桂滇黔諸省，銷路較佳·惟日貨亦頗活躍。川贛閩諸省·經匪亂之餘，經濟凋敝，前期交易甚微，近來漸有轉機·湘豫兩省，因小規模織廠林立·大部份己足自給，至鄂　蘇浙四省，市况閑散，亦非昔比，而南洋各埠，以土產滯銷，辦貨銳减，統計全年銷數，約共五千萬元（自二十三年七月至二十四年六月），較上年度僅及十分之七為弱。內本街交易約占百分之二十。約一千萬元·華南各省占百分之五十。約二千五百萬元。華北銷路占百分之二十，約一千五百萬元。若以本市莊號所在地之區域而論，則開設於英法兩租界者，其營業約須减少百分之三十。開設於虹口南市者，約須减少百分之　　，開設於閘北浦東及其他等處約須　　　　之五十。</p>
<p>七　市價比較</p>
<p>客歲我國鉅額白銀外溢，金融發生恐慌，銀根奇緊。市面蕭條，故棉布消費數額，較前年激减，市價步傾下游，春夏兩季，客銷頗形淸閑。入秋以後，各帮交易漸趨活動，中以天津帮採辦最湧。兩路沿綫各帮次之。市價微見回漲·然以內地購買力低落，未幾客銷又轉呆滯。市價始終未能堅佾。今年為首三月，布銷依舊消沉，市價仍無回挺之象，四月以後，稍見轉機，本外埠批發，故極活躍，其中尤以甬帮及長江沿。銷路為最佳。市價堅穩。迨四底將臨，金融日緊，客帮又裏足不前。除川廣兩地交易尚暢外·餘皆零星添辦，為數至微。五六月間。以時屆夏令，所有應市之貨，各地去胃己足，交易寂寞·僅川廣兩帮交易稍旺。七月交易漸見起色，本街，天津，廣東及長江各埠，銷路均稱不惡。市價穩定·八九月間，各幫添辦冬貨，去胃殊殷。長江沿岸各帮採辦尤多，本街營業，亦呈活躍，且以金價趨漲，成本增高，各布市價一致上騰，有漲一二分者，亦有漲數角者。自十月迄今因金價益呈堅俏，外滙步縮，原料逐步昂貴，布價亦水漲船高，且以貨幣行將貶值，財力較充之莊號，莫不儘量囤積，故交易極為忙陸。惟此項交易，純受則棉布前途，仍未容吾人樂觀也。茲擇兩年來通貨政策刺激所致，苟一般購買力未能增強，各種主要棉布市價，列表比較如左。</p>

<p>八　同業現狀</p>
<p>棉布業在上海市塲中，地位至為重要。當該業全盛時代，全市大小同業共達千家左右。每年營業總額約達一萬萬元以上。晚近數年，因憂患頻仍，民生凋敝，營業年見衰落。據棉布業同業公會發表統計，最近一年來營業總額己减至五千萬元，僅及全盛時代之半數，其詳有如下表。（單位千元）</p>

<p>查敝所主編之「上海棉布業概况」第五段「進貨情形」，略有誤植之處，如「國貨」項下第二行，「平均每「日約有白貨一萬餘件一，應為「平均每『月」約有白貨一萬餘件」：再「東洋貨」項下末尾第二行「每日」出品數約共二萬餘件」，應為「每「月』出品數約共二萬餘件」。希於明日更正為荷！此致</p>

<p>兒童教育小說</p>
<h3>小男兒（一一六）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>『你呌我做的，可是我也不很担心——媽爾媽爾總還是喜歡我的，』羅勃向答道，現在差不多各事都己絕望，於是不得不戀戀於最後的大維聚了。</p>
<p>『我眞餓呀，我們吃此莓實罷，』稍停一下甫恩創議道，其時羅勃已開始搖搖欲睡了。</p>
<p>『我也很餓，可是我不能吃我的，因為我告訴過媽爾媽爾，我要把它們一起送給她的。』</p>
<p>『你不能不吃它們，假如沒有人來接我們去，』南恩回答道，這個時候她覺得對什麼話都要反對一下的模樣。接着她又說了幾句可怕的話，『假如我們在這裏住上好多天的話，我們得吃完田塲裏所有的莓實，以後我們只可等死。』</p>
<p>『我會吃樟樹的葉，我知道一株大黃樟，唐恩告訴我松鼠門怎樣掘起那些根來吃。我又是愛掘的，』羅勃同答道，他卻沒有被餓死的景象所嚇慌。</p>
<p>「不錯；我們可以捉蛙，把它們烹煮。我的父親喫過一些，他說味道真好呢，」南恩又　入道，她雖然迷失在荒野裏，還要找些兒冒險的事情做做的。</p>
<p>「我們怎能烹煮蛙肉？我們沒有一點火。」</p>
<p>「那我不知道；下次我們須得有炎柴在袋裏，」南恩說道，她想到烹煮蛙肉的試騐又發生了阻力，心中甚為收興。</p>
<p>我們不能從游火蟲裏取火嗎？羅勃忽樂觀地問道，因為他看見了飛來飛去像是生了翼翅的火花。（註一）</p>
<p>「我們且試試看，」於是他們費了好幾分鐘去撲游火蟲，要想借它們來點着一二青枝條。『呌它們游火蟲眞是騙人，它們原沒有一些兒火的，』南恩說時一手便將一個晦氣的昆蟲，輕藐地拋擲開了，難然那昆蟲卻是最亮的一個，至而它還不惜上下枝間，以娛悅這一對天眞的小試騐家。</p>
<p>（註一）吳語「游火蟲」云云，殆即「榮火蟲」。音「但游火蟲」云云，頗有詩意，故本書決稱為「游火蟲」。</p>

<h3>紗花籌碼鬆濫　紗花狂瀉　進銳退速投機可畏</h3>
<p>紗市上日大漲之後、引起獲利者吐出、市價又復狂瀉、此種猛漲狂跌之局面、完全一般投機商之熱化、但金融界在前市仍屬拖進、惟金子帮有林某之多額、賣出了結不少、午後檯風轉挫、跌勢驟起、且來扮洶湧、目前同業均在空頭地位、一遇機會壓迫亦見劇烈、不過現紗客方需求甚殷云、</p>

<h3>美安出籠　標棉跌勢亦慘</h3>
<p>棉市大落、且跌風尤熾、前日飛漲後、引起獲利者了結、致場中籌碼鬆濫、市價乃狂瀉、據云美商美安洋行多頭出籠、惟日商東棉洋行又購進甚鉅云、</p>
<p>鄭標回跌一元左右</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一致狂落、且局勢不振、因美印棉不佳、轉向下跌、多頭乘機出檔、市價乃疲、惟通記·元一·大批吸收、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌四角半至六角半、午後開盤尚佳、因日商東棉購進、但拍至二三盤、跌風劇烈、以福家洋行多頭大量賣出、市塲籌碼充濫、市價乃下瀉、惟金融界之多額、安然不動、收盤遠月回升一角、結果各月比上午收盤價又跌二角半至四角半、查賣出通記二千四百擔、大孚二千擔、梅記二千二百擔、合興二千八百擔、生源一千九百擔、信誠一萬二千九百擔、益康二千六百擔、源興昌五千二百擔、長和七千五百擔、大昌成二千六百擔、永大二千一百擔、買進大孚六千擔、通記二千三百擔、達記一千九百擔、錦昌四千二百擔、賡豐四千四百擔、愼記四千三百擔、仁豐三千擔、元一六千擔、益昶四千七百擔、潤康三千五百擔、長和八千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋麥成交一船　遠期粉暴跌一角餘</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、近遠期市面、一致猛跌不堪、跌度之狂、成交之暢、均有驚人之紀錄、查前日結局、已因棉麥借欺之謠、鬆跌三五分、至昨日則傳廠方確有洋麥成交一船、（四千五百噸）價六元五角八分、此種定價、就事實推考、並不足異、但多頭之立塲、有此反映、不免驚皇失措、因國內雖不足、國外則巳開其端、是以人心極度恐慌、當初開價、祇落、一分外、後則廠方出籠、業外大戶多頭、紛紛脫手、臨時浮空、又儘量加碼、較前日收盤、巳跌五六七分不等、但全下午回盤、市氣又見狂落、因廠方續出、大戶多頭、亦反賣甚烈、遠期因洋麥關係、跌度更見狂暴、如三四月份、竟跌一角一二分之巨、爲粉市狂漲以來、第一次之巨大打擊云、</p>

<h3>略論「胡適之體」</h3>
<p>— 陳子雲</p>
<p>有的人勸胡適之談政治，有的人勸胡適之談思想，有的人勸胡適之談文學，胡適之不免喟然長歎說：</p>
<p>「這眞是我的歧路了」！</p>
<p>胡先生，你談政治也不是路，你談思想也不是路，我還是勸你走走文學的路，再縮小一點範圍說，還是走新詩的一條路。但我不是希望你仍走「嘗試集」的那條老路，像「飛行小贊」（見立報「言林」「蓬廬詩話之一」，只有「看這桂林山水」一句，股一山字。）那樣的詩，似乎可以說是一條新路。老路沒有脫去模倣舊詩詞的痕迹，眞是好像包細過的脚放大的。新路是只接受了舊詩詞的影響，或者說從詩詞蛻化出來，好像蠶子已經變成了蛾。郎如「飛行小贊」一詩，牠的音節好像辛稼軒的一閱小令，却又不像是有意模倣出來的。聞一多的「冬夜評論」說：「詞曲的音節在新詩底國境的並不全體是違禁物，不過要經過一番查馳揀樣罷了」。這倒是令人首肯的話</p>
<p>我並不勸人接受什麼「文學遺產」，更不會朝印古文學書，自命風雅淵博。但有歡喜舊文學的人，從舊文學得到一點好的影響，學到一種合用的技巧，决不會說他「有開倒車之嫌」。何况新詩運動隔成功之日還遠，到新詩的路决不止一條，不妨「殊途而同歸」。像「飛行小贊」那樣的「胡適之體」，無疑的也還可以算是一條路，正如我所說過的「馮玉祥體」一樣。至於我所提出的「諷刺詩」「民謠詩」，（均見立報「言林」）以及我從前提出過的「農民詩」（見前年自由談）「大衆語詩歌」（見社會月報）等儘管還沒有詩人留下高貴的脚迹，那都不妨有人去走的，雖說路有大小，寬狹，平險的不同。</p>
<p>胡先生呵！你不要說「提倡有心，創造無九」。我很希望你仍舊拿出先驅者的精神，在新詩上創造一種「胡適之體」。這在你的前途上打算似乎不失爲一條路，在新詩運動上也不妨做一條路，許多路中的一條路，便是失敗，也可告訴無數的來者「此路不通」！</p>
<p>附記：有人告訴我，申報文藝週刋第三期有一篇詩論指摘我提出的「胡適之體」的意見。恰好文藝週刋和立報（上有我的詩話）都給一個朋友借去了，無法查考，只好憑一時管見所及，先寫了這一段小文。一九三五年，十一月二十日燈日記。</p>
<h3>流線型</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>孩子的心</h3>
<p>— 藏克家</p>
<p>眞是夢也夢不到的事，在這幾千里外的他鄕碰上了一位中學裏的同班老李，我一點也不曉得我的天涯正是他的故鄉呢。我們分散算起來已快到十年了。十年在人生上是一個大的籌碼，那麼，今天的不期而遇，是格外的可喜了。雖然在這長長的一段時間裏，世界另變了一個樣，我們各人也都有過可歌可泣的遭遇，可喜是大家的態度都還可以從當年的情形中捉摸個彷彿，至於樣子老了一點，這是沒法的了。</p>
<p>這裏，一堆做事的，老同學眞不少，就是老同班一共也有三個，另外還有一位×先生，在中學時代我們都呼他做×大Boy，時間沒在我們之間打上壁壘，一見面驚訝過一陣之後，從前那一套打鬧混駡的老態又搬出來了。老李還是老李，×大Boy還是×大Boy，我也還是我。想來眞有點奇異，是誰的手把我們從天邊拉在一起，又分開，於今却又在這兒合攏起來了？</p>
<p>說沒有變化是假的，老李的小孩巳來進中學了，他這會前來便是爲了送學生，幾乎和中學時代的我們一樣大的一個孩子，立在我們面前，恭敬的，天眞的，叫我想到小時在父執面前自己的那一副嬌羞和自得的樣了。這麼小的一個孩子却早已成爲人的丈夫了，我們拿這來嘲笑老李，嘲笑他幹過××，還這麼封建，說不定是願意趕造兒孫好享五輩同堂之福呢，還嘲笑他將來免不了自己的老婆和兒媳婦爭着生孩子。</p>
<p>那孩子似懂不懂的聽着我們在開玩笑，呆立着揷不進句話來。</p>
<p>「老李，兒媳婦多大了」？帶着另一種笑迫着問。</p>
<p>「唔，唔，我也說不多大凖，大約是十九了。」臉微微地汎紅了。</p>
<p>「那麼孩子呢？」</p>
<p>「孩子十四歲了。」</p>
<p>哈哈哈拍一陣掌，孩子似乎也有點不好意思，扭怩着溜出去了。老李臨走把孩子囑托給我們，最後還說「你們不能不到我家去看看呵，相隔只四十里路。」</p>
<p>老李走了以後，這孩子常常跑到我的屋子裏來，我雖然沒有他的課，然而却比親老師（敎功課的是親老師）還更親熱，看那份表情，我的屋子對他有點像家庭的溫暖。這孩子態度很是幽靜，眼裏閃着呌人測不透的光，和他父親一樣。然而這並不是呌人望去害怕，而是呌人更愛憐他。照例他自己不先開口，手弄弄這動動那的。</p>
<p>一點親熱迫我向他問寒問暖，最後又問到他轡羞的事上去了。</p>
<p>「你幾時結的婚？」</p>
<p>「去年。」</p>
<p>「媳婦多大了？」</p>
<p>「二十！」我幾乎沒有笑出聲來，倒底孩子的話是不會瞞人的。他說完了這一句，樣子變的嬌羞得像一個女孩兒。</p>
<p>「爲什麼這早就結婚？」</p>
<p>「我不知道，也不該爸爸事，我姑姑呌我娶的。」</p>
<p>「她對你好不？」</p>
<p>「……」眼看鵓子鼓得老粗，話就是吐不出來。</p>
<p>我又問衣服和鞋子是誰給做的，他仍然說不出來，我便把題目轉變了。我問他村邊的風景，問他家裏的房舍和人口，這他可得着說話的機會了。他說村子就在運河岸上，他常站在大堤上釣魚，他家裏還有一隻小船，願那會下水就那會下水。「在水裏弄船，才有意思呢」。說着兩手擺動着似乎已經變成了雙漿。他說今年的大水淹沒了他一頃多地，一點東西都沒有見，他說去年母親才給他生了個小弟弟，可是不在他自已家裏，呌奶媽帶去養活着，但離得很近，隨時可以抱來玩玩，最後又形容他的房子，用小手在桌面上繪圖給我看。他說希望我們能到他家去，那可以住在切（客）屋裏，白天他領我們到河堤上去玩。說傳色舞眉飛，彷彿我們已經走在到他家去的路上。</p>
<p>這也是一個意外的機緣，我的一個小叔叔也來上學了。很快的我把他倆拉在一堆，這是很合適的，同學的兩個孩子，又是同樣天眞可愛，不同的一點，便是我的小叔叔更活潑，更有趣一點。他們立即變成了形影不離的一對，我小叔叔來得太晚，什麼事他都以先進的情態敎給他，然而只有親熱的帮助，並沒有一點驕傲，星期的那天，他領他遊遍了這兒所有的名勝。臨走時，我給了他們一毛錢做糖果費（一毛錢在他們眼中是個可觀的數目呵！）下午回來帶着一身土向我報告了遊蹤和那一毛錢的消費，同時拍一拍黑制服的小破布袋，裏邊還有銅元嚮呢。</p>
<p>果眞，我的屋子成了他們溫暖的家了。吃過午飯或是晚飯照例得來一趟，來，從來沒有不是來一對的。雖然除了問問功課沒有多話可說，然而看兩個孩子依在桌面上那種可喜的樣子，眞够呌人安慰的了。同時我想，這間屋子也一定給了他們同樣多的慰安吧？</p>
<p>頭幾天他一勁說星期六要回家，因爲訓育主任說這天下午回家取寒衣是可以不請假的。他問我幾時到他家去呢，又到楊老師　裏去問他幾時去呢？我們都含糊答應了他星期六一固走。</p>
<p>昨天晚上我吃晚飯回來，他倆早已在燈下坐着了。一見我他便突然的問「老師明天幾點鐘起身呢」？</p>
<p>「向那裏去」？</p>
<p>我這一句話給小叔叔一個大歡喜，他立刻拍着手得意的嚷道：「我說不去呵！我說不去呵」！小叔叔的意思是願意我們都不走，鄱他太寂寞了。</p>
<p>小叔叔聽了我的話是得意忘形了，然而另一個却掃興得什麼似的，再也說不出第二句話來。停了一回轉向我小叔叔說「你也去啦」！</p>
<p>「不，不，您的家，俺不去」！小叔叔搖頭擺尾的頑皮勁又上來了。</p>
<p>「你怎麼這樣無情！人家好好約你！……」話出了口，又後悔說得多事，明明小叔叔是因爲時間不允許才說出這樣的昧心話呵。我能是不加這兩句話也就算了，不過一說出來那孩子的心却因而有點酸頭了。看他一轉身跑到楊先生屋裏去了，我這在後面聽去。</p>
<p>「楊老師明天什麼時候到我家去呢？」</p>
<p>楊先生也榜了一下。「唔，唔，我身子不好，時間又太短」，……</p>
<p>「老師去吧！明天走後天準可以回來，告兩點鐮假怕麼」？</p>
<p>「功課太忙了，又是纔來不久，不好因爲玩請假…」</p>
<p>他第二次回到我屋裏來了。這時恰好小叔叔到另一位老師那兒去了。我看他的一雙小眼，在燈光底下最初是汎紅，我把頭朝別處看，不敢對着他，一刻淚珠噙在眼眶裏了。</p>
<p>「你不要難過，我和你楊老師說說，一定可以去的……」</p>
<p>淚珠給這兩句話碰下來了。</p>
<p>我心下也十分不好過，一個孩子的好夢呌我們幾句話全打碎了！我打一盆水遞給了他一條手巾，他剛洗罷了，我小叔叔一步聞進來，什麼也不知道的問」×××明天你自己走吧！」說着口裏咂咂的出聲。他一聲不出只用兩隻小手一勁揉着眼睛。</p>
<h3>烏鴉</h3>
<p>— 袁塵影</p>
<p>—塞外雜寫之一—</p>
<p>烏鴉，是被人們認做不吉利的東西，胡適之似乎有一首寫鳥鴉的新詩：一我大淸早起，站在人家屋頂上，呀呀的啼，人家討嫌我，說我不吉利。」人們討嫌烏鴉，正是嫌牠呀呀的啼，有些曉舌和不安本份是的。</p>
<p>我曾從這沙漢中的塞北，到那麗日晴天溫柔的江南住過，我也曾在西子湖畔徜佯過，可是，在那些地方，我感覺到渾身上下軟綿綿的沒有一些力量，使不出一點一勁兒」來，於是，我深深地想起悲號着西北風的塞外大地了，然而，最使我懷念的還是在那廣漠的，無限，大的，靑靑的天空中，成千成萬在黃昏時天空中飛翔着悲號的烏鴉，牠們像是在爲全人類的命運悲號着，和着那像千萬條奔牛掠過楊樹的風聲，呵！在那平靜的南國，我是怎樣地眞實地懷念着荒凉的塞外呵</p>
<p>如今，我歸來了，剛剛是初冬天氣，風便像一隻發瘋的虎肆着威風從大靑山背後竄過來，吹得人心眼兒也有些冷的顫抖了。憂鬱的大靑山巓上又積起了冰凝的白雪，是冬天了呵！人們穿起了笨重的老羊皮襖，厚厚的毡鞋，街上，馬路上只有少數的縮着鵓子的幾個行人，風挾着沙子飛揚着，灌進每一個人的鵓子，枯禿了的楊榭發出簌簌的哀聲，你眞會想到：「是到了沒有人烟的北極了嗎」？</p>
<p>然而，可感謝的還是那被人視作不吉利的鳥鴉。早上醒來。風在怒號着，世界像是到臨了末日，只有屋後老樹上的咯咯的鳥鴉盤音，使你還會想到這是生在有血有肉的世界中。可是起來了以後，當那些鳥鴉夫野外尋食的時候，歸化城又像死一般沉寂下來了。</p>
<p>直到傍晚，西天的晚霞映照着人家的屋頂，是「夜書鳥歸巢一的時候了，數不淸的烏鴉散佈在天空，列成又長又大的陣勢，凄厲的咯咯聲和着塞外的狂風聲，像是有一種力—生的力—於是，才又使你感覺到這是回到人間來了。</p>
<p>呵！鳥鴉呵！巢眞是不吉利的東西嗎！</p>
<h3>逃難雜憶</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>逃難一事，照例是悽慘的，痛苦的，但我却嘗過牠的甜味，不過，這是在幼小的時候聽說官兵從省城打來，同治會的人馬抵擋不住了，家人便在黃昏之際，倉促逃到族人那邊去。說起來，族人那邊只距我家二三里路，逃也等於沒有逃一樣，但結果還是逃去了，那原因，就由於他們那邊在砍大柏樹，房前屋後，牆側籬下‘，正散佈着許多掘了樹根可以用來躱避子彈的洞穴。這是後來從大人的口中才知道了的，然而當時在我看來，只不過是些同小伴們做遊戲的好地方罷了。</p>
<p>農民的性子，大都是很節儉，很慳吝的，但我們到了目的地時，我那做莊稼的二爺爺—祖父的二兄弟，却吩咐家人在菜油燈光罩着的桌子上面，擺出要在過年過節才許吃的那些好東西來了，如像皮蛋鹹鴨蛋之類，他一面陪坐在旁邊，還很歉然似的說：</p>
<p>「隨便吃點吧！…怎麼不早點來？今天我們還殺兩隻鷄呢。」</p>
<p>心情抑鬱的祖父，聽見雞都殺來自家吃了，就突然把碗筷離開了嘴，深深嘆了一口氣：</p>
<p>「離亂年辰，雞犬都遭殃呵！」</p>
<p>「唉，自家吃了也好！…你們還留着麼？」</p>
<p>二爺爺浮起一臉苦笑，略帶解嘲似的回答着。接着兩個老人互相看了一眼，一齊同意似地，擺着兩個拖有辮千的腦袋</p>
<p>在家長這種不愉快的氛圍氣不吃飯，母親和叔父他們準是十分拘束的，但我却是最快意的了。因爲在家里，母親對小人的夜飯，是監督得頂嚴的，看見我吃了兩碗，還要再添的時候，就一面取去我手上的樓子，拍着我肩頭，溫溫和和地安慰道：</p>
<p>「聽媽話呀，夜飯少吃一口，就會活到九十九哪！」</p>
<p>這一夜，母親也不再作這樣的勉勵了，大約已明白，在這些時候，還要望人活到九十九歲，只是可笑的事吧？二奶奶坐在我的身邊，拿着接子陪我們吃點空菜的，看我手短，有伸不到去挾的東四，就不時簪我挾了過來，給我堆在飯上面，一面勉强笑微微地說：</p>
<p>「長大來，可不要忘記你的二奶奶哪！」</p>
<p>彷彿這次的晚餐，是含有重大的意義似的。</p>
<p>這一夜，大家都在地上鋪着厚厚的稻草，當作床睡。大人們似乎是不勝其苦了，可是在我呢，偏偏感到，是頂有味的。在家里，小弟弟每夜都有漏尿的積習，母親雖是被蓋洗得勤，蓆子常常晒，但總沒有這里的溫暖，這里的乾香。並且爲了一聽見子彈飛響，就容易跑出去藏躲起見，前後的門些，便却全行打開，深秋夜氣自由地透了進來，屋子里當然淳爽淸新得很。同時，我還可以在入睡之前，靠在枕上，張着眼睛，看一會站在簷頭窺人的星空呢。</p>
<p>同我二爺爺一個院落住的，還有一家族人，算起來是同我已死的曾祖父一輩的。這家里面最小的孩子，都要這我呌他做祖爺爺，眞是使我頂不願意的事情。並且全家幾乎都在燒鴉片烟，屋里常是靜悄悄的，只見昏暗的烟燈下面，放着二些帶病的臉子，不時發出吸姻的聲音而已。我被帶去玩時，總沒有引起他們的注意，只是悶悶的依在大人身邊，彷彿足手都被東了似的。但這一次逃難却不同了，第二天早上給祖母帶過去時，我的雙手，就給他們放滿了又烏又光滑的板栗，一動便辟辟拍拍地溜到地板上去，呌我慌忙地捉了這個，又淸掉了那個。將這樣的事情，來窘迫人，我是頂高興的。，祖母一面吃着板栗，還一面推辭說：</p>
<p>「够了，够了，嬸嬸，留着吧！」</p>
<p>我們那位年靑的叔會祖母，却又抓了許多出來，一壁說道</p>
<p>「留着？留着讓外人吃麼？這年辰！」</p>
<p>院落後面橫過一條白土河，只在夏天落雨季節，才漲滿幾天平河的大水，平常的日子，全是枯幹的，沙石泥土現了出來，讓兩岸的人家，在春天秋天，種上花生和小麥叔嬸和母親她們，在這逃難的日子里，悶得發慌，就想找些有趣的事情，來排遣雖耐的心情。不知怎的一下探聽出了：河那邊的沙地里，有么叔的未婚妻，在挖掘花生的好消息，大家便約着下午去偷看，自然我也被挾帶去了。大約是未來的新娘躱開了吧。（未完）</p>
<h3>歌哭</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>歌哭是亂世常有的現象，清末如此，明末也是如此的。前些時候的什麼事變，我們還看得見通電·請願·喊口號·貼標語·總之，我們還有聲音，而且有眼淚，連自稱「得失無所動於心」的老佛爺也痛哭了一塲。</p>
<p>這種宏亮的聲音，曾經被大家哂笑過，我也是哂笑他們的一個。爲什麼要哂笑呢？那理由很簡單：我所哂笑的，並不是通電。請願，喊口號·貼標語：而是那些通·請·喊。貼的人們，只知道通·請·喊·貼，除此以外，就更無別法，也更無別的什麼積極的行動的緣故·倘使一面喊貼，一面却照着口號標語實行起來，那末，我還是希望他們多喊幾聲，多貼幾張的。</p>
<p>亂世終得有一點聲音，因此，也有歌哭，然而對於一味歌哭，或者只知歌哭的人們，却應該加以諷刺，哂笑。</p>
<p>不過去年以來，我們漸漸地覺得冷靜，聽不見什麼聲音了，這倒並不是諷刺的成功。這個民族已經成了習慣。神經日益麻痺，不再有喜怒，也不再有歌哭了。</p>
<p>於是我們就只有沈默，沈默，沈默。</p>
<p>投下一塊巨石，聽不見一絲回音，割去一塊肥肉，流不出一滴血，這眞是奇怪的沙漢呵！</p>
<p>然而，大家所希望的，却是歌哭。</p>
<p>求諸今人不得，還是抄一首古人的詩吧。龔定庵詩云：</p>
<p>閱歷名塲萬態更，原非感慨爲蒼生。</p>
<p>西鄰弔罷束鄰賀，歌哭前賢較有情。</p>
<p>前人也只如此而巳，蒼生蒼生！</p>
<h3>「寫文章」</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>在周作人先生的散文集苦茶隨筆裏有幾篇很好的文論：廠甸之二，楊柳，以及寫文章二則。周先生近年唱導「文學無用論，說：『文學，只是以達出作者的思想感情爲滿足的，此外再無目的之可言。裏面，也沒有多大鼓動的力量，也沒有敎訓，只能令人聊以快意。』他只承認使人聊以快意一點，算作一種用處。自從言志派奉之爲大師，這些話彷彿成爲文章以閑適爲主的經典了。</p>
<p>說到文章的右用無用，本來是就在社會的影饗而言。作者以文字達出自己的思想感情，若把他鎖在櫃子裏，使牠永不見天日：那文章無用論就成文了。然而不然，周先生自己的苦茶隨筆，刋在大公報的文藝專刋上，給千千萬萬人看見；不足，還黑字印在白紙上，彙印一冊，在北新書局出版，又給千千萬萬去讀去看。這樣就有社會的意義了，周先生的思想感激起千千萬萬人的共鳴反應；夜鶯一聲的啼叫，振動了一位詩人的心弦，寫成一首夜驚歌，就此振動了千千萬萬人千千萬萬年的心弦，誰也沒法抹消這一聲啼叫的作用了。文章無用論的說法，只能說做文章除了達出自己的思想感情以外，不附帶做敲門磚的作用：至於文章在社會上的作用，作者並無權去决定；無論有用或無用。</p>
<p>周先生幾次說他自己是江南水師出身，對於文學是外行。而他的散文集中，談寫文章的文字却無不精當切實；他那篇我學國文的經騐，早成爲每個靑年的讀物。尤妙的，他雖在標榜文章無用論，而苦茶隨筆中都幾篇文論，每一篇都顯出時代的意義。如隨筆中的楊柳，正是針對着提倡讀經復興文言的倒車運動而說的。他說：</p>
<p>『在中學專做古文的學生不能寫文章。做古文（自然是濫古文）本來不難，只要先看題目，再找一篇格調來套上，就題字繞一陣子，就能成功。可是這樣一學會就中了毒，要想戒救極不容易。我平常不大出題目，這些學生覺得不便，叫她們自己出，大抵是國家興亡匹夫有責這一類的大題自，文章又照例是空泛的。勸她們改做小題目，改用白話試試看，做成之後作者自己先覺得可笑，文字與意思都那麼的幼稚，好像是小學兒童的手筆。有志氣的學生便决心盡棄所學而學焉，從頭學寫普通的文章，努力去用了自己的頭腦去想，用了簡明的白話寫出來，一面嚴防濫古文的說法想法的復活與混入；這樣苦心用功以後纔慢慢地可以挽回過來。差不多可以說至少要用一年的苦功來凈除從前所中的古文毒，併從頭來修習作文的門路。假如不能這樣做，只好老寫濫調古文下去，能够說人心不古或地大物博等空話，却終不能達出自己的意思來，這樣卽是不通而不可救了。』</p>
<p>叫學生讀古文做文言的準遺老先生們，看了這叚話，正如當頭淋了一盆冷水。周先生的文論，爲靑年們所接受，知道要寫通順的文章，非連這條平坦大路不可，誰也不能否定他在社會的意義了</p>
<p>其實周先生肚子裏何常不雪亮，他叫靑年不要做那類的大題目，不要說「天下興亡，匹夫有責」那些空洞話頭，何常不是苦口婆心，對症下藥。又他批評韓退之，說：「我對於韓退之整個的覺得不喜歡，器識文章都無可取，他可以算是古今讀書人的樓型，而中國的事情有許多郤就壞在這班讀書人手裏。他們只會做文章，談道統，虛驕頑固，而又鄙陋勢利，雖然不能成大奸雄鬧大亂子，而營營擾擾最是害事。講到韓文，我壓根兒不能懂得他的好處。（廠甸之二）也是一種針砭。大家若誤會周先生「文章以達出作老的思想，戚情爲滿足」的主張，以爲寫文章只是用閒適的筆調來裝點風雅，消遺人生，那又上言志派徒子徒孫的大當了。</p>

<p>淋病。卽俗謂白濁。誰都知道是一個難治之疾症。在急性及亞急性時。猶容易措施。到了慢性。尤其是年久的。那就比較的困難了。從前治療淋症。僅投以尿路消毒劑及局部行洗滌殺菌法。如是痛苦旣多。收效又鮮。現在雖然仍未能拋棄內服及洗滌等法。但其藥物之新穎。巳非從前可比。現時所最爲醫家所推重者。在電器療法中。莫過於治急性之最新療濁機。及治慢性淋之短波透熱電機爲最佳良而有確效也。前者以光力殺菌。後者以電力熱力殺菌。施用短波透熱電療時。隔衣可以療治。尤爲便利。在藥劑治療法中。當推混合淋苗田及色素。一以透膜殺菌。一則自動免疫。相兼互用。收效亦佳。內服之藥劑中。尤以滅殺淋Mesaltropin為最合優良條件。因該藥具有强力之殺菌消毒止痛除炎等諸功效。我礙於胃腸。並能恢復尿道黏膜之發炎部分。是故醫家都甚樂用之。局部治療之藥劑。最為穩妥者。莫「可拉克謹兒」若。因其能深透黏膜而肆其殺淋之效。且些微無損於尿道黏膜。德國滿爾志大藥廠出品之「淋毒舒樂耳」Gono-Sorol甚優。此藥乃以淋病血淸與舒樂耳所製成。根據自動免疫之意義。其效力並不遜於伐克辛之注射。如病患僅在尿道部分時。奏效尤宏。老友馮善樑先生所主持之春在醫院。在本埠法租界寗波路六十六號。對於淋病治療。研究盡詳。聘有男女醫師多位分別擔任科目。電器療械。應有盡有。收費旣廉。辦理盡善。（滅殺淋及淋毒舒樂耳。均歸本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。前者每盒一元。後者每盒二元五角）。</p>
<h3>鴉片嗎啡對於血管之作用</h3>
<p>— 佘雷醫師</p>
<p>任何動物於高度嗎啡中毒時。始因血管。神經起源處麻痺。而血管之緊張乃减。血壓乃沈降。然於人類如以藥用量與之。已見血管擴張。其最先受侵害者。爲全身皮膚之血管。而顏面及腦之血管受害更早，蓋此等神經中樞最易受其影響故也。而其結果發現之症狀。如溫暖感。顏面潮紅。發汗。發疹。皮膚瘙癢。呼吸及脈搏之輕微增加等。若用多量。則全身血管擴張而血壓下降。顏面等之紅色變為蒼白矣。腦血管與顏面血管同時擴張。此點可由呼吸與脈搏之增加及腦逆上而推知之。故頭部易於逆上之人。宜禁用嗎啡及鴉片劑。</p>
<h3>胃痛之治療</h3>
<p>— 孫志耀醫生</p>
<p>胃爲消化食物之主要臟腑。常分泌一種消化液。此液含有鹽酸消化素及酵素等。食物入胃。卽與”液相混和。而起一種發酵作用。能得食物漸漸消化。胃酸有防腐殺菌之功能。如食物混有微菌。均可由監酸將徵菌殺滅。胃酸又有與消化素起共同之作用。將食物中之有益人體質分。變爲容易吸收之滋養品。營養人體各部。胃酸之於人體。極關重要。胃酸有一定之量。若過多或不及。均足致疾。尤以過多爲甚。胃酸過多之最普遍症候。厥爲胃痛。胃痛雖亦有其他原因。然亦以胃酸過多爲多。發生本症。除胃痛外。必兼有吐酸。嘈囃。噯氣等等現象。胃酸刺戟作用甚烈。若過多則時因胃粘膜受過分之戟刺。因而發炎或成胃潰瘍之瘼。漸至胃出血者有之。胥皆忽於於初病故也。胃酸過多之適宜治療。當以中和胃酸爲主要。其發胃痛。胃粘膜炎者。尤以「胃寶」爲最優。該藥爲胃痛之特效劑。舉凡一切胃痛。皆具神效。例如急慢性胃炎胃辨瘍等。現歸本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。每盒二元云。</p>
<h3>淋毒舒樂耳治淋之宏效</h3>
<p>— 程魯雪醫師</p>
<p>淋病的穩妥治療。誠推混合淋苗之注射及短波透熱電爲最合理。但有因時間地域之限制。金錢職務之關係。則非藉自療之法不可。患者所可自行施行者。惟內服與局部二療法而巳。內服藥中之佳良而得確效者。舍「滅殺淋」其誰屬。此藥之透膜殺菌力比衆强大。名醫之推獎文獻。時見報章。早已馳譽醫林。卽一般病家。亦深樂用。至於外用藥。通常恒以藥液殺菌法。此法在醫者施諸病人。尚可斟酌病情。而定相當時問及農度。設病家自己施行。其無優良後果。可斷言也。近今德國滿爾志大藥廠發明之淋病尿道局部所用藥「淋毒舒樂耳」GONO-SEROL係採用淋病血淸及舒樂耳所製成。注入尿道局部。因具有自動免疫之藥效。故能收準確治愈之功。該藥現歸上海法租界八八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。每罐二元五角。</p>
<h3>治癬妙藥滅絕菌</h3>
<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>癬。微恙也。但欲求妥效之專劑。亦頗不易得。蓋治癬之藥。須美具如下諸條件。始可謂之優良製劑。（一）須有强力之殺菌消毒作用。且絕無絲毫損及皮膚之虞。（二）使患處之痛感癢感。完全消除。（三）藥力須能深透皮膚層。但不因皮膚之吸收而碍及內臟。（四）無厭惡之氣味。不知污及衣被。如是四美俱備。可謂聖品。「滅絕菌」不單爲治癬之良藥。卽一切皮膜疾患。俱得收全治之功。凡疥癬。頑癬。濕疥。癢疹。面皰等等。用之靡不立收神效。殺菌力之强大。超越一切凡品。蓋其能深入皮膚層而奏其宏偉之藥效。他如疼痛瘙癢等苦感。搽擦一次。已可消除。且其氣味芬芳。絕無污及衣被之虞。該項藥品。爲本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售良藥之一種。</p>

<h3>神經衰弱治療談</h3>
<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>神經衰弱。可說是現時的普遍病。特於年靑者爲尤甚。本症有腦神經衰弱及性神經衰弱之別。腦神經衰弱症。一般普通症狀。大率爲頭重頭暈。記憶不佳。病的失眠等等。性神經衰弱。一般普通症狀。大率爲遺精。精漏等等。對於本病治療的文獻。疊見報章。近世治療法之日進。一般人對於醫學常識的增加。俱未見有任何佳良影響到本病進展的銳减。是誠一種社會的深切的企憂。特別是靑年之性神經衰弱症。性神經衰弱症是局所神經衰弱病。幷非嚴重的腦神經衰弱的全身神經衰弱症。也可以說是生殖器的障碍。所以治療本症的時候。雖說滋補神經系統的有機性燐及內分泌爲不可或缺之要藥。但是局部的治療。亦不可缺。例如近今所賞用的短波電療機。治療本症的內分泌和有機性燐的製劑。成藥中如「安爾神」AROLSEN頗爲醫學家所推許。根據臨證實騐。如能適量服田此藥。經過良好。患者嚴守攝生。後果定獲完美。（安爾神經售處本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁議西藥社。每盒一元五角。編者。）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>爆竹的功用</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>據報載全國商會聯合會昨爲湖南瀏陽縣爆業公會籲請取消爆竹特捐，代電財政部一函，要面有瀏陽縣爆業公會瀝陳撤銷特捐理由四項，讀後發現了爆竹竟有着「意想不到之效用」奠是出於意料之外；今特摘錄於后：</p>
<p>……據福建民報載，福建省政府會議决定，增設迷信特捐，列入爆竹一項，擬定稅率百分之三十……查爆竹絕非迷信物品，早經漢口前爆業公會呈准國府前衛生部化騐，定爲衛生品。蓋此項物品，不僅供冠婚喪祭之需要，尤可以摒除烟瘴，使人神智淸明，誠大有益於人類之健康，謂爲迷信物品，則大謬不然……</p>
<p>在這裏，我們且不顧（顧也顧不了）將此豐饗於端賴此項手工業出產品謀生的瀏陽縣數十萬貧苦農工商人的生計，也不問此爲當地執政當局的「任意苛捐」：不過，由此而竟發現了爆竹的巨大用途，興覺得是「意想不到」的！</p>
<p>一般地說來，我們所知道的，所能看到的，爆竹除「不僅供冠婚喪祭之需要」外，在碰到一般善男信女。們要拜天謝地，過年過節的當兒，爆竹却也不可缺少，此外在羣衆歡迎某名人，某要人駕臨某地的碼頭或車站上，更有在戰爭得了捷報（像上次「一一一八」滬戰的某夜），球塲比賽勝利的當兒，爆竹也就被一種人使用着了。然而，這個除了表示致敬，慶祝之意外，在今日這個社會正到處鳴着不平，普遍鬧着恐慌的「不景氣」狀態之下，我們只有「錯覺地」感到這些「黃鞭」跟「高升」，在紙片飛揚，硫磺氛圍中悲慘地，忿怨地高叫着「逼，迫窮，怕……」之呼聲吧了！而這種聾耳的慘叫，難聞的臭氣，却說牠「可以摒除烟瘴，使人神智淸明」，甚至這還是「大有益於人類之健康」。這樣，卽不是「大謬不然」，也覺得有些「差强人意」了！</p>
<p>不過，在今日，在這個世界上，原有着許多的事可要「耐人尋味」。然要是在你尋到了「味」兒的時候，那可又要使你「啞然失笑」了。外表果然「一貌堂堂」，其實內裏正是稻草一包——所謂「金玉其外，敗絮其內」是也——說來似乎「冠冕堂皇」，拆穿了却「不過如此」。什麼瓜子，花生要稱爲「大王」，臭豆腐乾果然叫賣着「衛生」；留學生發明（？）了「科學靈壇」；算命先生可以自稱十爲「哲學大家」……甚至小丑式的打諢，正掮起了「幽默」的牌子；分明是帝國主義的侵略勾當，却正拿着「親善」，「提携」，「東亞和平」，「灌輸文明」做幌子。</p>
<p>本來，我們的社會，正一般地變演着這許多自欺欺人，利誘，威嚇等等賈野人頭的把戲。所以，這個經衛生部化騐證明不含毒素而定爲「衛生品」的爆竹，要成爲「大有益於人類之健康」的「醫藥品」，「興奮劑」，也並不是偶然的事。</p>
<h3>日觀茶樓</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>鄉行小誌</p>
<p>外鄕人到我們縣城來想暢游一番的話，本地領導一定毫不遲疑地告訴他們：東門外的孔廟，和西門外的日觀茶樓。孔廟在東門外三里遙，附近是義墳，蔓草孤丘之間，孔廟在夕照下顯示着牠的尊嚴的萬仭紅牆，所以卽是沒有孔老二的神位，也可以作爲詩意葱籠的勝景，供來客的一番徘徊了。但是日觀茶樓與孔廟同列爲本邑的名勝就令人費解了。說來一番話長呢！</p>
<p>第一：日觀茶樓自火災之後，已改建爲中學爲體，西學爲用的洋房門而了。在重行開市那天，就爲了洋房門而的誇耀，賣了十來天水擠不通的滿座；不論同業，或是各種交易上，牠是始終保持着本邑賣買最高紀錄。直到現在，日觀茶樓的營業在同業之中總是佔着上風的。第二：信不信由你，日觀茶樓是三層樓呢！這並不是太邑居民的目光短小，三層樓有什麼了不得呢？實在，縣城的公共機關，如縣政府，公安局，以及號稱錢百萬張大戶等本邑首屈一指的富豪，就沒有超過二層樓以上的房屋；這不是日觀茶樓的威風嗎？新造的三層樓洋房呢！</p>
<p>知道了這些，那末到本城來游歷的時候自然得瞻仰一下這三層樓　房門而的日觀茶樓了。他是牠與孔廟，並列爲本邑兩大名勝之一，這裏面還有一段歷史！</p>
<p>雖然我五六歲時候就牽着祖父上日觀茶樓去吃糖食，直到現在返鄕偶然也去坐一會，聽到這段歷史無止數十百遍，但是人各其說，旣沒有縣志錄稽考，說牠是歷史，毋寗作爲神話罷。總之，淸朝，或者，甚至明朝，有一位欽差路過本城，他微服到這茶樓上啜茗。坐到掌燈時分，掛在城牙齒上的落日金光燦爛地照射到茶樓上來，那位欽差或許由泰山日觀峯的啟示，想到在這茶樓上觀日出，一定亦有一番勝景，就從筆囊中取出筆來，賜名日觀茶樓四字；並詩興勃發，吟詩一首，揚長而去，次日，本邑縉紳知道這回事，欽差早已連夜開船去了。就斥資把，觀茶樓四字上匾，一首詩也裱裝定當，懸掛在匾的上而。這首詩說的什，我小時候沒有注意到，想注意的時候，日觀茶樓遭了祝融　災，現在三層洋房裏的匾，也不是眞蹟了　。</p>
<p>日觀茶樓二層樓的茶分三個價格，底下是販夫走卒等作爲賣買及打脚之處，香茗每壺十枚。二層樓上是小學敎員及商店職員等畏衫階級薈萃之地，價加倍。三層樓上可稱之爲馬褂階級，雖　現在也有西裝革履的　髦少年，但不是本邑頂括括的人物是沒有資格踏上第三層樓梯的。樓上的陳設也超乎一切茶樓之上的：沿四壁是紅木坑床，中隔不几分上下首，几上供四時花卉，坑床上冬則　墊，夏則凉席、躺着啜茗談天，是舒服無比的。卽是　央的茶座，　始大理石面的紅木桌，　桌靠四把籐椅，可以打小麻將，下圍棋。香茗每壺大洋一角，爲本邑同業之最高價。如果那位欽差能長壽，今日重過茶樓，恐怕也沒有雅興來題名吟詩了。</p>
<p>此次鄉行旬日，因爲公私交逼，沒有抽得一些空閑上日觀茶樓去瞻仰那番新氣景，家人告訴我日觀茶樓上（自然單指三層樓上）時常發生爭吵打架，因爲茶博士的工心計，以及那些茶客們想玩新花樣，晚上通常有羣芳會唱，蘇灘，　明文戲等各種游碼頭班子在那裏串演那新花樣就把馬褂階級的老爺少爺們　得不安穩起來，發生爭吵打架的下流舉動。</p>
<p>我想，此後日觀茶樓的聲名或許要超過宮牆萬仭的孔廟的。或許，再有這末一天，本地領導會告訴外鄉人本邑的名勝祇有日觀茶樓，那新造的三層樓洋房。</p>
<h3>失業</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>八點鐘被鬧鐘催醒了，昨晚私自許下的願心—睡一個暢快，終究因爲沒有習慣，在臨睡時會下意識地把鬧鐘的發條絞足。我探首出被外？向陰暗的窗口　了一眼　想翻個身再睡，妻却端了面水進來了。她每天要比我早半小時起身，預備我的早餐，聽見了鬧鐘的聲音，就進房來催我，數年來像機器一樣，沒有改變的時候。但是從今天起，我已不須要八點鐘起身了，我可以隨我的意思睡到什麼時候，不過妻沒有知道，我也不願意把這個不幸的消息破壞家庭的秩序，雖然牠終有一天會暴露的。我很快地下床，盥洗完畢，用早餐，挾着公事皮包出門了。</p>
<p>門外是迷漫着重重的濃霧，像我心頭被鎭壓着一塊石頭一樣，迷失了東西南北。我在弄口站着，自己狗目己磋商着：到底到什麼地方去？而那個地方可以逗留我一整天。慢慢地走到電車站，過見行裏的同事，不，現在應該說朋友了。「到什麼地方去？」他問我—這個我自己也不能回答的問題。在行裏，我們的感情比較是最好的，他不致爲了我的失業來取笑我，但是我直覺這是一枝箭，他在侮辱我。我虎起了臉，彷彿聲斥一個下屬似的回答：「哼！這裏沒有吃飯，吃飯的地方多哩！」朋友却沒有生氣，緊握了我的手：「恭喜你，過一天我來拜訪拜訪…」他跳上駛進站的電車走了。</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>我心頭輕鬆了一點，我高興我有那樣的勇氣，不過他是我的朋友，假如他就是昨天駡着「猪玀，滾蛋」的洋鬼子，我該是如何值得自誇呵！</p>
<p>電車一輛一輛地駛過去，站上的人漸漸稀落，那個賣報孩子驚奇地瞟着我，說道他會知道我今天沒有去處嗎？我依舊向他買了一份報，在他向別人兜售的時候，我溜開了。我匆匆地跑過一陣路，濃霧已經消逝，望見位崗上的標準鐘九點已過十分，那問題又亳不留情地緊逼着我，要是這時候再遇見我的朋友，我還有勇氣那樣回答他嗎？這樣想着時，我避進了一條靜僻的馬路，一個偷兒似的沿着牆壁走去，低下頭，不敢向前觀望，我怕見人家的眼睛呢！走過公園門首，我站定了，這是遠有個自由的世界，可以逗留我一整天的。就踅了進去，尋了一處幽靜的角落，面向太陽，展開報紙讀着，一張，二張，三張，四張，附刋，廣告，那些廣告上有着血腥的字蹟，我感到疲倦了。舉首望天，太陽沒有當頂，儘坐着不是獃子？今天這個身體應該自由一點，公園里是很好的初冬景象呵！我站起身來沿着池畔走去，像那些穿着皮頒大衣，支着手杖的紳士一樣，緩緩地，彷彿我是一個畫家，或是一個詩人，悠閑地搜尋作畫吟詩的材料。走過大草地，轉過曲徑，繞過茅亭，又回到池畔來了。這樣一次二次，我覺得自己在讚一個什麼圈套，永遠沒有出頭的樣子。望望脚下的影子漸漸縮小，肚子也餓了，就踅出來推開一家俄國大菜館的玻璃門。</p>
<p>老闆挺着大肚子，堆着一團笑臉歡迎我。今天他該是我的知己，他的眼睛不像別人那樣兇狠狠地，瞇得幾乎像一條綫；然而他沒有眼睛不是更好嗎？</p>
<p>我要了一點濃烈的俄國酒，飽餐了一頓，又被人送到靜僻的馬路上來了。於是「一整天」的問題變成「半天」了，但是半天也要過了半天才過去的呵。光陰如箭，我忽然唸到這句從小學時就讀得的名句，自己笑了，莫明其妙地笑了。</p>
<p>踅過三條馬路，我忘了是否曾轉灣，怎樣又到了公園門首，自然又踅了進去。這時候，園里沒有一個人，我重尋到了早上坐過的鐵椅，再展開報紙讀着，一個報館編輯那樣地用鼻子在每一條電報，新聞里嗅着。在第五張的角落我發現了一個大秘密：「某大殷實保險公司招請書記及打字員」。我駡着「猪玀，混蛋」，早上翻了整半天的報紙，怎沒有看到這秘密呢？興奮地用小刀子把這秘密剪裁下來，藏在大衣袋里。「哼！這里沒有飯吃，吃飯的地方多哩！」想着我希望我的朋友明天晚上就來拜訪我。把報紙向池子里一丟，我走出了園門，預備化幾毛錢，到一家小電影院去看一張片子，今天應該自由一點的呵！</p>
<p>回到家里已是六時，比平常遲半小時，妻問我行里忙？我沒有回答，把晚報擋住了自己的臉，默唸着那保險公司的地址。</p>
<h3>唱新聞</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>鄉村中的秋晚是寂寞的。</p>
<p>偶然有一陣肅殺的秋風輕輕地打從脊屋上爬過，拂得瓦縫里的幾片枯葉也刷刷地打起滾來。</p>
<p>晚飯後，大家照例總要想法找尋點兒娛樂，來消磨那個悠長的黃昏的；可是今晚那個娛樂也就生了問題。每個人的心里在苦問着，圍着一盞煤油燈，談些無聊的閒事。那昏黃的燈光照射在灰黯的禿壁上，將我們幾個影子也在牆上畫出了許多糢糊的輪廓，</p>
<p>週遭是靜穆的，連了屋樑上有一隻耗子爬過的啾嗦聲也很淸晰的聽得——（未完）</p>

<h3>The Situation in North China Turns Chaotic: He Yingqin Secretly Consults with Xiao, Chen, etc.; Song Zheyuan Issues a Statement on the Current Situation; Cheng Ke, etc., Arrive in Peiping to Confer with Chen Yaogong</h3>
<p>(Peiping) This morning at 11:00 AM, He Yingqin convened another secret consultation at Jurentang with Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, and others regarding strategies for dealing with the current situation in North China. Although it is very difficult, after consultation with all parties, dawn is gradually appearing for the future, it will not be difficult to open a new situation, overcome difficulties, and there is hope. Regarding the content of the strategies, he has also consulted Cao Rulin, Wang Yitang, and others in recent days, and it is reported that Cao and others have also drafted methods and presented them to the authorities for review and reference. After Li Zeyi arrived in Peiping, he repeatedly visited a certain important Japanese figure. It is said that the conversation between the two parties was quite harmonious. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the situation in North China, Song Zheyuan issued a statement today, saying: The precarious and turbulent situation in North China has hope of turning from danger to safety since He came to Peiping to take charge of the overall plan. Moreover, He has met with both Chairmen Han and Shang, and since he has a real understanding of the actual situation in North China, a complete solution can naturally be obtained. Since I have been guarding Peiping and Tianjin, the central government has ordered Shang Zhen to be responsible for the security of Tianjin, while I am only responsible for the Peiping area. Recently, there has been an order to revoke the Garrison Headquarters, and my responsibility will be reduced from now on. All difficult problems in the future should be handled under the orders of He, who will be responsible. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Since He Yingqin came north, the current situation in Hebei has been repeatedly discussed by Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, Xiao Zhenying, and Qin Dechun, and after Xiao and Chen went to discuss with related parties, it is reported that considerable results have been obtained, and a solution can be studied in three or two days. According to Xiao Zhenying, since He, Chen Yi, and Xiong Shihui arrived in Peiping, and after I, Qin Dechun, Chen Yi, and Xiong Shihui discussed it, a turning point has now been seen, but everything still needs to be discussed in detail. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Cheng Ke arrived in Peiping from Tianjin last night with Secretary-General Sun Runyu, and immediately visited He that night to report on the recent situation and the maintenance of security in Tianjin, and had some talks. This morning, he continued to visit He. Liu Yushu, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, arrived in Peiping from Tianjin this morning to visit Mayor Cheng Ke, made a report, and will also visit Song to ask for instructions on Tianjin's security matters. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yin Tong arrived in Peiping from Tianjin this afternoon and went to Jurentang to visit He for a report. After He arrived in Peiping, he has been consulting with local authorities on specific solutions to the situation in North China. It is reported that as of now, internal issues are still being discussed, and no external negotiations have been conducted yet, but the general attitude is optimistic. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Yushu, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, Wang Ruoxi, Director of the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, and Gao Hengru, Director of the Jinpu Railway Tianjin Office, were summoned by He Yingqin on the 5th to go to Peiping one after another to discuss important official matters. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The envoys of various countries in Peiping have been sending personnel to Jurentang to present their cards to request a meeting with He in recent days. It is said that He has agreed to formally invite them after all matters are arranged. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan went to Xiyuan at 11:00 AM this morning to inspect the garrison troops of Feng Zhi'an's 38th Division and gave a speech to the soldiers. (First Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju's handwritten letter to He Yingqin was handed over to He Qigong today to be presented in person in Peiping. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the situation in Hebei, He Yingqin is in contact with both internal and external parties after arriving in Peiping. Foreign telegrams reported that a political affairs committee will be established in North China, with three departments under the committee: political, military, and economic. Their powers are equivalent to those of the former Executive Yuan's Peiping Political Affairs Committee, but the scope of jurisdiction will be reduced. This is just one of the rumors, and it is still under multi-faceted research. Whether this principle will be used to determine the cells of a complete organization is still difficult to predict at this moment. Minister He has not yet submitted any concrete suggestions to the capital. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) On the evening of the 5th, Tian Yuru, Zhu Zhezhi, Pan Shusheng, and 21 others went to Jurentang to submit a petition to He. They were received by Hou Cheng on behalf of He, and after Tian and others made their statements, they left. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government has cast seals for the Director of the Executive Yuan's Peiping Office and the Director of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters in Hebei and Chahar, as well as small seals, which have been sent by the Civil Service Department to the Executive Yuan for distribution and use. It is hoped that the date of use will be reported to the government for record. (Fifth Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The attitude of Chinese leaders towards the autonomy of North China is obviously tough. Today, Japanese newspapers in this area made hostile comments on the latest developments in the situation in North China. The Japanese newspapers severely criticized both Song and He, believing that He's northward trip would trigger the activities of anti-Japanese organizations. Today, leaders of the education circles here sent a telegram to He Yingqin and the military leaders of Hebei, declaring their unanimous opposition to the autonomy movement and their willingness to fully assist in preserving sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Fifth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan issued a written statement this afternoon. After He arrived in Peiping, the Chinese are quite optimistic about the current situation and feel that the Japanese are ready to await the results of the meeting of the Chinese leaders. He Yingqin met this morning with Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Xiong Shihui, Chen Yi, and others. It is reported that He sent a long telegram to the central government last night reporting everything. It is rumored in Chinese circles that Itagaki met with He last night, but this has not been confirmed. (Fifth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peiping) News from Shanghai says that the Japanese authorities hold a serious view of the "insult" to the Japanese army by the Peiping Public Security Bureau. Correspondents from Chinese, Japanese, and foreign newspapers spent several hours interviewing the nature of the so-called "insult," but were unable to ascertain the truth. When they inquired about this matter to the Chinese military and civilian authorities here, they all claimed to be unaware. The Tianjin Japanese military authorities issued a statement saying that they hold a serious view of the insults added to the Japanese army in Peiping, but did not specify what the insults were. It seems that the oppression of the Japanese authorities here will not end as desired. Well-informed Chinese all said that even the most trivial matters are now being viewed with seriousness. The public speculated that the so-called insult refers to a case that occurred on December 2, when four Japanese forcibly entered the home of a Chinese here to demand payment, and were arrested by the Chinese police. According to the Chinese side, these four Japanese claimed to be police officers from the Japanese consulate, but the Japanese embassy later denied this. The Chinese police then arrested them. After discovering that one of them was a plainclothes Japanese military police officer and that the one assisting in debt collection had immediately stated everything to the Japanese authorities, the authorities concerned all considered the matter to have ended on Sunday. (Fifth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peiping) It was initially reported that Song Zheyuan had gone to Xishan. According to reliable sources tonight, Song has taken a car to Tianjin and is staying in the British Concession. Song has a residence in the concession. (Fifth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<h3>Many Counties in the War Zone Still Accept Orders from the Provincial Government; The Situation in Various Counties of Eastern Luan Is Extremely Desolate; A Ban on Opium in the Liushouying and Shihe Areas</h3>
<p>(Peiping) The Pseudo-Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Association sent personnel to various counties to promote autonomy. The various counties in the war zone still accept orders from the Hebei Provincial Government. Counties such as Changlu have established councils according to provincial orders. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to a telephone call from Tangshan, the Eastern Hebei Autonomy Association previously ordered the chiefs of the various security regiments to recruit new police officers on their own. After receiving the order, each regiment intends to recruit two new police battalions to actively expand. Currently, each regiment has recruited hundreds of new police officers, assigned them as artillery and infantry, etc., and is actively training them. It is reported that the guns are issued by the Anti-Communist Autonomy Association. Lulong County has announced martial law. Local gentry, etc., demanded the establishment of a county council. The county government ordered the security team to arrest two ringleaders. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Second Regiment of the War Zone Security Forces stationed at Liushouying issued an order on the 30th to announce a special martial law throughout the county. All passers-by must be inspected. Many suspects were arrested that day, and merchants and residents were ordered to close their doors at 5:00 PM every afternoon and stop pedestrians at 6:00 PM. No passage is allowed without a password. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The situation in various counties of Eastern Luan is extremely desolate, and commerce has fallen into complete stagnation. Funing and Fengrun, which are said to be the most prosperous, are like dead cities every night at 6:00 PM due to the early curfew. The Pseudo-Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Association constantly posts announcements to dispel rumors and stabilize people's hearts, but to no avail. People are tired of hearing about the pseudo-autonomy, but because of the high pressure from a certain country, they dare not openly resist and speed up the disaster. Zhang Qingyu's Second Security Regiment is gathering towards the route, and martial law has been announced from Liushouying to the Shihe area. After 6:00 PM, no passage is allowed without a password, and joint defense is implemented with the four counties of Funing, Qian'an, Linyu, and Changli. Wang Shaocheng, a gentleman from Lulong County, opposed the pseudo-Eastern Hebei organization and the false name of autonomy. On the 3rd, he contacted villagers from various townships to petition the county government to restore the old system. If autonomy is a must, a county council can be formed. The pseudo-government dispatched a large security team to forcibly disband the petition and arrested Wang Shaocheng and imprisoned him. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As for the pseudo-organizations of the rebellious Yin in the Eastern Hebei war zone, the tax collection agencies established by the Ministry of Finance in the area were ordered by the ministry to collect taxes in other locations at that time. According to investigation, the customs and salt tax revenues have not been affected so far. There are no detailed reports on other taxes. Generally speaking, the impact is not very significant. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The relationship between various counties in Eastern Luan and the Hebei Provincial Government has not been severed. Recently, various counties have established price stabilization committees according to provincial orders to prevent high prices and disrupt the financial order. However, after receiving the provincial orders, they are renumbered and filed separately. After the various tax revenues in the war zone are collected by the pseudo-organization, they have been sharply reduced. The taxes contracted with contractors have been unable to collect due to the inability of merchants and residents to move forward, and they have been crying for help and not sending them in. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng ordered the five security regiments in the war zone to expand by two battalions each. Each regiment now has a total of eight battalions. Guns and artillery are shipped from a certain country's Northeast arsenal and distributed, and trained by people from a certain country. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) It was rumored yesterday that Yin Rugeng was sniped. Someone called Tongzhou from Peiping to inquire about the details. Yin replied on the phone that he was safe and sound, Tongzhou was peaceful, and he was rapidly carrying out everything. (Fifth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Multiple Japanese Aircraft Flying Over Peiping</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Five Japanese aircraft formed a formation over Peiping City at 2:00 PM today and distributed a large number of leaflets, circling the city for a week, and then flew southwest. It is said that the five aircraft took off from Tianjin and came via Tongxian. In addition, nine Japanese aircraft flew from the east at 3:00 PM today, passed through the eastern city area, and flew directly south. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Eastern Hebei aircraft flew from Peiping to Lvtong at 3:00 PM on the 5th, circled over the city once, and dropped several kinds of leaflets printed in red and green paper. The number of Japanese aircraft landing at the Tianjin Dongjuzi airfield is uncertain every day, with a maximum of five aircraft. They all fly from abroad and fly elsewhere after a short stop. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Five Japanese aircraft flew to Peiping at 2:20 PM on the afternoon of the 5th to conduct reconnaissance, circled once, and then flew east. Twenty minutes later, another nine aircraft came and flew southwest after a while. (Fifth Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Japanese aircraft are now using Peiping as their target for demonstration. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft demonstrated over the sky of He Yingqin's official residence. Today, there were 14 Japanese aircraft and one aircraft of the so-called Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government soaring in Peiping City. The Eastern Hebei aircraft was previously owned by Japan, and the pilot was Japanese. It came here at 1:00 PM and dropped thousands of leaflets, asking citizens to support the autonomy plan and celebrating the establishment of the Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, five aircraft flew in formation, and an hour later, another nine aircraft followed. All flew very low. These aircraft were not intended for reconnaissance, but purely for demonstration. Their origin is unknown, but it is known that they came from the north, probably departing from Chengde. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tianjin, one aircraft of the Eastern Hebei government flew over the Shanghai Concession of Huashi this afternoon and dropped colored leaflets, asking people to support the autonomy of North China. Lieutenant Colonel Kubota, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in Lushun, will arrive in Tianjin tomorrow to organize a temporary office to communicate with the Japanese military authorities stationed in Tianjin.

<h3>Investigation of Occupied Land at Tianjin Japanese Airfield; Chen Dongsheng Negotiates with the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government forwarded a telegram from the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, instructing Chen Wenhong, Director of the Tianjin-Guzhen Security Command, Chen Dongsheng, Counselor, and Chen Zhongyue, Magistrate of Tianjin County, to conduct a detailed investigation and report on the Japanese engineering situation at the Tianjin Dongjuzi Airfield. Chen Dongsheng visited Tada, commander of the Japanese garrison, again on the 5th to negotiate on the Dongjuzi airfield matter. Tada said that the borrowing period can be shortened to two months, and the price for the occupied civilian land will be paid by the military after a clear investigation. Chen has telegraphed the province for a report. After investigation, the Japanese have forcibly built an airfield in Dongjuzi, occupying 13.4 hectares of land, including 5 hectares of Beining Road land, 8 hectares of Li Chun land, and 0.4 hectares of land shared by Yang Jixiang, Yang Binzhong, Liu Xiangchen, Wang Deming, and Li Chunyi.

<h3>The Beining Road Materials Depot is Being Monitored</h3>
<p>(Peiping) After the Pseudo-Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Association was established, it sent personnel to take over all agencies in the war zone. Although the Xin-Yuguan section of the Beining Road has a railway administration, it is inconvenient to take over due to the British loan relationship. The bureau sent Secretary Pang Yongxuan to Yuguan on the 3rd to station there permanently and monitor the bridge factory and materials factory, prohibiting the external transportation of goods, and the personnel have not been changed. Pang visited the local authorities in Yuguan yesterday accompanied by the Yuguan station chief. According to the talks, although the Beining Road has international relations, the Anti-Communist Association is still negotiating for takeover. I am here to permanently station and monitor the factories, vehicles, etc., and only after the takeover can the official work begin. In addition, the railway administration has recently sent personnel to station at various stations along the line for monitoring. Since there is no takeover, there is no work and they are only monitoring in various offices every day.

Since the railway administration has not taken over the railway station, there is no work to be done, so they are all just monitoring at various offices. It is also reported that because the railways had not been formally taken over, the staff members were merely sent to the different stations to watch, but not to work. According to reports, the pseudo-administration of the Xin-Yuguan section of the Beining Road did not actually take over the road because there was British investment involved. Only 6,000 yuan was extracted from the Tangshan Road funds for several days, and the traffic order was as usual. The Luanhe Railway Bridge project has resumed construction. (Fifth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The China Committee of the House of Commons discussed the situation in North China today, but the members, in view of the complexity of the situation, were unwilling for Members of Parliament to raise questions one after another. However, there is now a strong desire that the government should not abandon its responsibility, because Britain's interests in North China are not small, and the political stability of central and southern China is now felt. Although the British newspapers have not criticized it, they have published Chinese news in important positions. The British are now very pro-China, unlike when the Manchurian Incident occurred. According to the experienced, the Japanese will eventually accept a compromise solution, because the five provinces of North China cover a vast area, and without the cooperation of the Chinese, the Japanese will not be able to manage them.

<h3>First Plenary Session Held, Anniversary of the Zhaoye Warship Uprising Commemorated</h3>
<p>Various agencies and organizations in different locations also held commemorative meetings separately.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The First Plenary Session held the 20th anniversary commemoration of the Zhaoye Warship Uprising at the Central Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 5th. More than one hundred members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees attended, arranged in order according to age. After the music was played and the meeting commenced, Chairman Chen Guofu led the attendees in performing the ritual, observing three minutes of silence. Chen then delivered a detailed report on the events of the Zhaoye Uprising, which lasted for over forty minutes before the ceremony concluded. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Guofu, on the 5th, at the commemoration of the Zhaoye Uprising held at the Plenary Session, gave a report outlining that the overthrow of Yuan Shikai was attributed to the Zhaoye Uprising, just as the overthrow of the Manchu Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution was attributed to the Huanghuagang Uprising, both sharing the same spirit. After the Second Revolution, the spirit of the Party was scattered, and command was inconsistent. Mr. Chen Yingshi sensed at that time that the revolution had failed because the comrades did not listen to the Premier. Therefore, in February of the fourth year, he returned to Shanghai, vowing to work hard in Shanghai to revive the spirit of the Party in order to overthrow Yuan's imperial dream. He first gathered comrades to work diligently in the navy, and then promoted it to the army. The uprising began to be launched in December of that year. (Describing the process of Mr. Chen Yingshi commanding the Zhaoye Uprising) Although this uprising failed due to some people not proceeding as planned, the spirit was very good, and the revolutionary force was able to manifest in Shanghai, where Yuan's defenses were tightest, shaking the entire country and eventually leading to the Yunnan Uprising, which overthrew Yuan. This is most worthy of our commemoration. We see the revolutionary spirit of Mr. Yingshi in this uprising and the bravery of the comrades involved, proving that obedience to the Premier's orders can strengthen the Party and overthrow all enemies. It is also affirmed that if comrades can obey the leader and maintain unified action, then the Party's command will be unified and the revolutionary spirit will be vibrant. Therefore, the Zhaoye Uprising holds great merit in the history of our Party. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Incident of the Tianjin Dagongbao Being Detained</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, Tianjin Dagongbao published an article urging Song Zheyuan, no matter what, not to incite the division of the country. The entire article was tactful and well-rounded. The first paragraph expressed deep sympathy for Song's difficult situation. Then, fearing that the authorities might be misguided for a moment, it proposed two principles: (1) "At this critical juncture, it should be recognized that, no matter what, the unity of the country must be guaranteed. For public or private interests, for the country or for the region, this last line must be defended. If it is said that foreign affairs cannot be handled without dividing the country, I fear there is no such logic in the world." (2) If the country must be divided, then "the authorities must publicly take responsibility in their own names and must not use public opinion as an excuse." Finally, the newspaper believed that "for the sake of Commander Song and his staff, they should earnestly explain to Japan the necessity of maintaining China's unity, and persuade them not to go to extremes. On the one hand, they should explain the reality of the precarious environment to the government, and independently decide on a method that adapts to the current situation." However, according to yesterday's report, after this article was published, the newspaper has been ordered by the Tianjin Garrison Command since the 4th to be suspended from distribution.</p>
<p>Looking at this article as a whole, it takes the nation and the country as the premise throughout. The wording is also peaceful, fair, and moderate. It is tactful and indirect. Now it has been detained by the Pingjin Garrison Command, which is really puzzling. In the Pingjin area, the absurd leaflets promoting autonomy issued by Chinese traitors are everywhere. The local garrison command can watch with folded arms and not interfere. Why can it not tolerate this text urging the North China authorities to pay attention to national unity? Moreover, this article in Dagongbao is purely advisory in nature. Its motive is nothing more than fearing that the authorities are confused and trapped in fallacies, so it specifically suggests from the sidelines. The content does not specify that the North China authorities have any suspicions, which is very different from simple slander. Furthermore, the North China authorities can regard this kind of text as "correcting it if there is something wrong, and adding encouragement if there is nothing wrong." If they truly stand on the position of representing the interests of the nation and the country, then their actions will eventually be made clear to the people of the country and will be understood by the people of the country. There is really no need to take such unwise measures.</p>
<p>We cannot help but deeply feel the importance of eliminating interference in the field of speech here. As the country is in a time of serious crisis, if the government wants to respond firmly and effectively, it should first allow the great voice of the field of speech to exert its due authority, so that traitors will be afraid and those who plot rebellion will have nothing to borrow. And to arouse the national consciousness and national concept of the people of the whole country. If we do not pay attention to this point, the future of the country is really deeply worrying.</p>
<p>According to the latest news, the Dagongbao detention incident has been ordered to be released by the Ministry of Transportation. This unfortunate problem is expected to be resolved. We only hope that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.</p>
<h3>British and French Experts Draft a Peace Agreement, Also Submitted to Italy, Much Land Swapped Between Italy and Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources, the new peace plan drafted by British and French experts was completed today and will be forwarded to the Italian government by the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerutti. The contents of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Italy cedes the Port of Assab and a strip of land in Eritrea to Abyssinia, and Abyssinia builds a railway in the area, with funding provided by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(2) The border of Eritrea is revised to cede part of the Tigre province to Italy, but Aksum and Adwa must be returned to Abyssinia.</p>
<p>(3) The border of Italian Somaliland is revised to cede part of the Ogaden province, south of 8 degrees north latitude, to Italy.</p>
<p>(4) The remaining land of Abyssinia remains independent and does not need to be placed under international co-management as suggested by the Committee of Five, but the Abyssinian Emperor may conclude an assistance treaty with the League of Nations. French officials believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will be able to accept this suggestion, and hope that Mussolini can consider this the final concession. The French side solemnly declares that the exchange of land between the two sides is a completely autonomous action. The plan was drafted on a broad basis, and there are still differences between the opinions of the United Kingdom and France, which can be revised during negotiations in Rome. (国民电, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After consultations, British and French experts have submitted a new proposal to Italy to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian War as soon as possible. According to informed sources, the United Kingdom and France believe that this proposal can serve as the basis for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. It was delivered to the Italian Ambassador to Paris, Cerutti, by French Prime Minister Laval yesterday afternoon. The purpose of this move is clearly to elicit some opinions from Mussolini, so that when British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Laval meet on the 6th, there will be something to base it on. However, Italy seems unlikely to give a satisfactory reply. Although Laval has stated emphatically that this is the last proposal that can be put forward before the Eighteenth Committee meets to consider the oil embargo, according to dispatches from Rome, it is difficult to hope that Mussolini will accept it. It is widely believed that this proposal was formulated following the guidelines of previous talks, and contains the idea of ​​broadening the country by ceding the Port of Assab in southeastern Eritrea, along with a corner of land, to Abyssinia. A railway can be built on this land to connect the Abyssinian capital to Assab, and will be supervised by the League of Nations. Italy will also return the holy city of Aksum and Adwa to Abyssinia. Abyssinia will cede the entire southern Ogaden province to Italy, and allow for important revisions to be made to the borders of the Tigre and Harar provinces. The Committee of Fifteen also suggested previously that many economic benefits of the Abyssinian homeland be given to Italy, which is now being mentioned again. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, met with Foreign Office Undersecretary Vansittart today, and the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerutti, also held talks with French Prime Minister Laval. People here attach great importance to these two matters. It is rumored that Cerutti presented an important document to Laval on behalf of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dispatches from London and Rome have been received here stating that the Italo-Abyssinian issue is currently being negotiated by the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy in order to seek a peaceful resolution. Officials in charge of the League of Nations believe that the attitudes of all parties have indeed softened in the recent negotiations, but due to a lack of accurate information, it is difficult to predict what the future of the talks will be. As of now, the Eighteenth Committee is still scheduled to meet on December 11th to discuss the oil embargo issue. The postponement of the meeting has not been considered. However, if the negotiations have materialized and the basis for a peace agreement has been accepted by both Italy and Abyssinia before December 12th, then the Eighteenth Committee may postpone the meeting. If so, a special meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council will be convened immediately, and the draft Italo-Abyssinian peace agreement will be submitted to the Committee of Five for review. This Committee of Five to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has not yet been dissolved. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Appointment of Hoare and Mussolini to Meet is Uncertain, British and French Foreign Ministers Will Meet in Paris</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, Foreign Secretary Hoare will go to Switzerland to recuperate this time, and will stop in Paris on the way to meet with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. Around Christmas or New Year's, he will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Switzerland. It is said that Mussolini has only left the country three times since taking power. The first time was in December 1922 to attend the London Conference to discuss the German reparations issue. The conference had no results, and France then took the action of sending troops to occupy the Ruhr region. The second time was in 1923, to go to Lausanne, Switzerland, to participate in the Turkish-Greek peace conference and conclude the Treaty of Lausanne. The third time was in 1925, to go to Locarno, Switzerland, to conclude the Locarno Pact. If he goes to Switzerland to meet with the British Foreign Secretary this time, it will be the fourth time he has left the country. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Officials have now denied the claim that Foreign Secretary Hoare will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Switzerland. Hoare, along with his wife and one private secretary, is expected to fly to Paris tomorrow afternoon to meet with French Prime Minister Laval. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) There are still many differences in opinion between the United Kingdom and France, and further discussions will be held at the end of this week when Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval meet in Paris. The United Kingdom agrees to demarcate the city of Adua and the Agam region in northern Abyssinia to Italy, or to make appropriate modifications to the boundary line between the Donakil region of Abyssinia and Italian Eritrea. As for the southern Ogaden region, which is a barren and sandy area, it can also be incorporated into Italian Somaliland. The boundary line of the proposed Italian colonization zone is: (1) The eastern boundary is the existing boundary between the Ogaden region and British Somaliland, that is, east to the Entoto Gefu area; (2) The western boundary is a straight line from Lake Chana to British Kenya. Within the aforementioned boundary line, Italy may relocate people to engage in cultivation, conduct commerce, and promote the political sovereignty of the region, which should still be retained by the Abyssinian Emperor. As for Italy, it should demarcate a road in Eritrea that leads to the Red Sea, along with the Port of Assab, and grant it to Abyssinia as an exchange. In France, it is advocated that the entire Tigre province, that is, the area currently occupied by the Italian army, be demarcated to Italy, and the boundary line between the Donakil region and Eritrea should also be given more important modifications. The southern Ogaden region should also be ceded to Italy. As for the boundary line of the colonization zone allowed to Italy, the French opinion is the same as that of the United Kingdom, but it is believed that although the political sovereignty of the region still belongs to the Abyssinian Emperor, its administrative power should be exercised by Italy, and Italy should appoint a deputy governor to reside in the Abyssinian capital. Whether this plan succeeds or not depends on whether the Port of Assab can be ceded to Abyssinia. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday afternoon, the Italian Ambassador Cerutti visited Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, and the meeting lasted for half an hour. It is generally believed that although this meeting was at Cerutti's initiative, Laval took the opportunity to notify the Italian Ambassador of the suggestions made by the British and French experts as a result of their talks to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. News of the situation of these talks has been transmitted to Rome in recent days. It is said that the opinions of the British and French experts are now approaching each other, but an agreement has not yet been fully reached. The work of the experts is based on the method of exchanging land between Italy and Abyssinia, because this method is easier to draft, enough to make the League of Nations feel satisfied, and Italy and Abyssinia also have the possibility of directly reaching a compromise. In general, most of the suggestions made by the Committee of Five of the League of Nations Administrative Council in September have been abandoned by the British and French experts, who advocate that Abyssinia should maintain complete independence, and that before the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is completely resolved, it will not ask countries to provide financial and economic assistance under the supervision of the League of Nations. As for the proposed land exchange method, it is roughly that Italy demarcates a corridor in Eritrea that leads to the Red Sea, along with the Port of Assab, and grants it to Abyssinia, while Abyssinia cedes a piece of land between the northern Tigre province and French Somaliland to Italy. The holy city of Aksum is within the ceded area, but it still belongs to Abyssinia, and the city of Magale is also demarcated outside the area. As for southern Abyssinia, the land within 8 degrees north latitude and 38 or 40 degrees east longitude, including the Ogaden region, is all to be granted to Italy. In addition, the United Kingdom agrees to the eastern 40 degrees. According to the observation of some people here, although Mussolini did not approve of Eden's proposal in August, he may be willing to discuss the above methods. Informed sources believe that the above plan will enable Foreign Secretary Hoare and Laval to have greater possibilities in their talks on Saturday the 6th, and that no matter what attitude Italy and Abyssinia take, it will be enough to ease the international situation.

<h3>British Warships Leave the Mediterranean, Commentators Say It is a Friendly Gesture to Italy</h3>
<p>(London) Today, officials claimed that the British warships stationed in Gibraltar are now sailing out to cruise to a certain location in the Atlantic within the Strait. Commentators say this move is a friendly gesture to Italy. Well-informed circles in London point out that this statement is inaccurate, because the fleet always makes this cruise during exercises. Although the ships have left the Mediterranean, they will definitely not be far from the Strait of Gibraltar. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar The British Home Fleet stationed here left this morning and sailed to the open sea farther from the coast for exercises, scheduled to return here at the end of this week. In addition, the two largest British cruisers, the HMS Hawkins and the HMS Repulse, have also sailed to the Portuguese island of Madeira and other ports, scheduled to return to Gibraltar on the 18th of this month. According to informed sources, the HMS Hawkins is sailing to Madeira, and the HMS Repulse is sailing to Dakar, French Africa. Several other destroyers, including the HMS Keppel, sailed out of Huelva, Spain, for exercises. It is also said that this exercise has absolutely no political significance and is completely unrelated to the Abyssinian incident. The intention of the British Admiralty is that it is not appropriate for the Home Fleet stationed in Gibraltar to remain stationary for a long time, so it has made it sail to the open sea for exercises. Therefore, the exercise location should be within 20 miles of the Port of Gibraltar, so that it can be concentrated in the port within a few hours if necessary. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Rome Also Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>(Rome) Recently, there have been official rumors that the war situation on the front line is unfavorable. The government has taken strict measures to punish them.

This news is being spread by people from countries participating in the sanctions. All our citizens must not believe it." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Three British Airships to Make a Far East Flight, Depart from Singapore in Mid-February, Via Manila, Hong Kong, Shanghai to Tokyo</h3>
<p>(London) The Air Ministry announced today that the Royal Air Force's 205th Squadron, consisting of three airships carrying a total of 25 officers and crew members, is scheduled to depart from Singapore in mid-February for a return visit to Japan. The Japanese government has granted permission. This trip will pass through Manila, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and Shanghai to reach Japan. After arriving in Japan, it plans to continue to several places, returning via Hong Kong, then via Cam Ranh Bay, Indochina, and returning to Singapore in the second week of March. The entire journey is approximately 7,000 miles, led by Admiral Smith, Commander of the Royal Air Force in the Far East. The stay in Japan will be approximately one week. This is the first time the Royal Air Force has visited Japan. Because it needs to fly over and land at ports in other countries along the way, it is currently requesting the approval of the governments of the countries concerned. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Atlantic Airline to Start Trial Flights Next Year and Open the Year After</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Postmaster General Farley stated that he will request funds from the next Congress to open the Atlantic air mail service. Trial flights will begin next summer, and the official opening is expected in 1937. This route will be undertaken by an airline run by Americans, but because it is necessary to seek an airport abroad, it may also be undertaken jointly by American and foreign companies. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Aviation experts from Canada, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland, and the United Kingdom came here today to discuss the Atlantic air mail issue with US officials. They have been at the Ottawa Conference for several days. Postal Minister Flay said he is prepared to ask Congress to designate funds to open the airline at the appropriate time. (国民电, 4th)</p>
<h3>Laval Prepares to Dissolve the Fascist League; Accepts All Demands of the Radical Party</h3>
<p>(Paris) Last night, French Prime Minister Laval held important consultations with the leaders of the Radical Socialist Party, the result of which has increased the hope that the government will secure a victory in today's political debate in the Chamber of Deputies. According to reliable sources, Laval has accepted all the demands of the Radical Socialist Party, the most important of which is said to be the dissolution of the Fascist League. Those who support the government are now extremely optimistic about the outcome of today's debate in the Chamber of Deputies because Laval's actions have already secured the support of powerful elements within the Radical Socialist Party. Yesterday, the Radical Party continued its meeting to decide the party's attitude towards the government in the Chamber of Deputies today, but after further discussions, no compromise was reached, which is another favorable development for Laval. At the same time, the outflow of French gold in the past few days has greatly decreased. This is the result of the increase in bank interest rates and the strengthening of the national psyche. People are generally satisfied with this. Although the weekly report of the Bank of France declares that the outflow of gold in the week of November 28th was worth a total of 300 million francs, the report for next week will show a large decrease in the outflow of gold, as almost no one has withdrawn gold since December 1st, except for 3 million francs worth of gold that was withdrawn on November 30th. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies continued its meeting this morning to discuss the activities of fascist groups. Members of the Central Right Party, such as Barton and Henri, spoke, questioning why the government was particularly tolerant of the extreme left-wing Popular Front. The Chamber adjourned at 1:00 PM until 4:00 PM, at which time the debate should become more intense. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>Italy and Abyssinia at War for Two Months; No Major Battle Yet; Abyssinian Troops Still Heavily Mobilizing in the North</h3>
<p>(London) Abyssinian vehicles are now advancing from the Aushango Lake area towards Magal, 65 miles southeast of Adowa. The war between Italy and Abyssinia has lasted for two months, and no major battle has yet occurred. A major battle may begin within days. Abyssinian troops are commanded by General Gazar, including the Abyssinian King's Guards. The offensive is equipped with rifles, machine guns, and new artillery. Their vanguard has been sighted by Italian outposts stationed about 15 miles south of Magal. Italian troops are delighted that a real battle is about to begin. At the same time, small groups of Abyssinian soldiers are still harassing Italian troops in the Danakil area. Italian troops claim to have occupied half of the Danakil area. While attacking Magal, Abyssinian troops may also take the offensive on the southern front, hoping to coordinate their efforts. The "Hindenburg Line" built by the Abyssinian troops on the southern front has recently been completed. Junior officers strongly advocate an attack, but senior officers have not yet agreed. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Asmara: The troops under Abyssinian General Kekesam are still heavily mobilizing today, indicating that the first major battle in the Italian-Abyssinian war will take place on the northern front within days. Reports received here today state that General Seyoum, who was twice rumored to be dead, is now leading 30,000 troops towards Amba Alagi to join forces with General Kazar. (National, 4th) Asmara learned today that a large Abyssinian force, carrying the latest military equipment, attempted to cut off the Italian defense line from Magal to Duro after contacting Italian outposts in Magal. It was announced here today that four regular Italian troops were killed in the battle of Dèbri. (National, 4th)</p>

<h3>Former Commander of Italian East African Forces Returns Home; Arrives Quietly Without Welcome</h3>
<p>(Rome) Former Commander-in-Chief of the Italian East African Forces, General De Bono, quietly arrived in Italy yesterday, unnoticed even by newspaper reporters. When the General arrived in Syracuse, local officials greeted him. He is expected to arrive in Rome today. There are no reports of any welcome plans from the government or the public. The General is of short stature, with white hair and sharp eyes. He established military achievements in the Libyan War and World War I. Mussolini greatly valued him when he was a soldier. After Mussolini came to power, he appointed him as his military advisor. He successively served as the head of the police department, commander of the militia, and governor of Tripolitania. In 1929, when the government was reorganized, he was appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs. His position as Commander-in-Chief of Italian East Africa was replaced by General Badoglio in mid-November, and he has now returned to his country depressed. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian East African Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio said at the time of his inauguration that he would not engage in propaganda, and he has now fulfilled his promise, reporting only to the Italian High Command that "both fronts remain in their original state." (National, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The King and Queen of Italy have moved countless Italians after donating their 39th wedding anniversary gold rings to the government to increase Italy's cash reserves. It is expected that on December 18, Italy's "Day of Faith," a large pile of gold rings will be placed in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which will then be melted down and cast into gold bars. The government announced today that those who donate gold rings will be given stainless steel rings by the government. The government also announced today that the King and Queen of Italy have canceled their New Year's reception for foreign guests, demonstrating the royal family's efforts to cooperate with austerity measures.

<h3>Motion for Independence Defeated in the South Irish Parliament; No Basis for Negotiations with Britain</h3>
<p>(London) A motion was introduced in the South Irish Free State Parliament requesting that the Free State government ask the League of Nations to recognize Ireland's independence. If the League of Nations does not grant the request, then the Free State should withdraw from the League of Nations. This motion was put to a vote today and defeated by a majority. Another motion criticizing the policies of the Free State government has been passed, with only one vote against it. Prime Minister de Valera claimed that even if South Ireland's membership in the League of Nations does not benefit South Ireland, it cannot prevent it from pursuing national unification and independence. As for the rumors that Britain and the Free State are negotiating, there is no basis for them. National freedom is not a dream and can eventually be achieved. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Five Nations' Representatives Gather in London; Naval Conference Becomes Increasingly Imminent; Opening Ceremony Next Monday; Many Conflicting Opinions Between the United States and Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Representatives from Britain, France, and Italy attending the Naval Conference will arrive in London on Friday in order to participate in the opening ceremony on Monday. The Japanese delegation has now arrived in Britain. The government originally planned to host a banquet on Monday evening to entertain the representatives attending the Naval Conference, but due to the death of Princess Victoria, the banquet has now been postponed. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The chief Japanese delegates to the London Naval Conference, Nagano and Nagai, visited the Admiralty this morning to pay their respects to the First Lord of the Admiralty, Monsell. The French delegation, led by Vice Admiral Robert, the Italian delegation, led by Rear Admiral Piscya, and the US delegation, led by Norman Davis, are all scheduled to arrive here tomorrow. The Italian, French, and American representatives are all scheduled to meet with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Monsell, on Sunday afternoon. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Experts said today that the current international balance of power has been disturbed by the African war. Recently, world attention has refocused on the upcoming Five-Power Naval Conference. For several weeks, the generally accepted comparative strength of the world's naval powers has changed, as the air power of each country should be given more attention when calculating naval strength in the future. The tense situation between Britain and Italy caused by the Italian-Abyssinian conflict has shown that the power of the air force can prevent the British Mediterranean Fleet, at least a part of it, from using Malta as a base of operations like the iron wall of the past, and it must retreat to Alexandria and Gibraltar. This matter deserves attention. This is enough to show that naval commanders are deeply concerned about the power of bombers. Furthermore, the African war has made it impossible for Britain's naval power to take care of matters outside of Europe, and Japan's comparative strength has naturally increased, as Japan can now act without hesitation along the coast of East Asia. This naval conference was convened by the British government in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Treaty of February 6, 1922. The treaty stipulates that a conference must be convened to re-discuss if one country gives notice of abandonment. The Japanese government notified all signatory countries on February 6, 1934, declaring its intention to terminate the treaty on December 31, 1936, in accordance with Article 23 of the treaty. Therefore, Britain re-invited the United States, Japan, France, and Italy to meet in London. Naval experts here all say that if this conference cannot resolve the issue of the size of each country's fleet in the future, then the international arms race and the danger of war may follow one another. Now that the conference is near, observers have many doubts about the future of the conference. Britain and Japan have both expressed dissatisfaction with the existing restrictions, namely the Washington and London treaties, while Washington still insists on the 5:5:3 ratio. Although the London Treaty did not reduce the total tonnage of each country's battleships, it did limit the number of ships. Therefore, no giant ships have been built in recent years. If a new treaty cannot be established after this conference, then the cost of one ship, which requires US$20 million, will increase again. (National, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese representatives attending the London Naval Conference stated today that political issues cannot be separated from naval issues. Their position is based on a statement from the Tokyo Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which states that a naval agreement cannot be concluded until there is a complete understanding of the political issues of the world situation. The Japanese representative stated today in his private capacity that at this conference, they are not prepared to discuss the size of warships until all political issues have been resolved. The reason why they have adopted this position is that the naval ratio issue in the Washington Treaty is inextricably linked to the security and reputation of Japan and other countries. After Japan expressed this view, diplomatic experts believed that the hope for this conference has been completely eliminated. (National, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department expressed surprise upon hearing Japan's claim that discussing political issues at the naval conference is unavoidable. Well-informed observers believe that the United States welcomes following the scope of the 1922 Washington Conference and continuing the current naval ratio in order to seek a comprehensive solution to the Far East issue, but since Japan does not want to accept the ratio system, the United States will not agree to discuss political issues at the naval conference. (National, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is rumored that the Japanese plenipotentiary Nagano declared in London a disarmament policy, saying that he was not opposed to abolishing submarines and welcomed the conclusion of a Pacific non-aggression treaty, but this is completely contrary to Japan's policy and is likely to be a misrepresentation. Therefore, today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement of confirmation: The Japanese plenipotentiary delegation must seek instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy before issuing a statement, but there has been no request for instructions so far, so it is not believed that this statement was issued. The abolition of submarines runs counter to the Japanese government's disarmament policy, so it is not believed that it was stated. Submarines are defensive weapons, so in inferior naval countries, they can achieve military goals economically. Therefore, if the countries do not agree to completely abolish offensive weapons, Japan will never agree to abolish submarines. A Pacific non-aggression agreement, which seeks to ensure the security of the Pacific through group organization, is contrary to the Japanese diplomatic policy of East Asianism. Therefore, Japan will not discuss naval issues unless it agrees to a Far East non-threat non-aggression agreement. The existence of Article 19 of the Washington Treaty, which restricts the fortification of the Pacific, is a matter that Japan is prepared to respond to if proposed by the countries concerned, but it will not actively propose it. (Dentsu, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Admiral Nagano, the chief Japanese representative to the London Naval Conference, recently made a statement to a reporter from Havas, saying, "The main basis of Japanese policy is security. We believe that security must be equal, so we believe that the right to equal naval power should be a prerequisite for the establishment of all agreements. In our view, the right to equal naval power is equal to guaranteeing our country's security. In short, only the Japanese Navy Department has the right to determine the scope of our country's needs to cope with the environment." The reporter then asked what Japan's opinion would be on the issue of limiting total tonnage if the Naval Conference recognized Japan's right to equal power. Admiral Nagano replied, "We are now beginning to discuss this. We will discuss the maximum limit on total tonnage with the delegations of the various countries in a spirit of compromise." Referring to the qualitative restrictions on the navy, Nagano said, "Japan's attitude will depend on how Japan's first demand (namely, the right to equal naval power) and the issue of total tonnage are resolved." When asked whether the Naval Conference would discuss the issue of the fortification of Pacific islands, Nagano said that Japan would not object to discussing this issue if other delegations raised it.

<h3>Tolstoy's Death Anniversary</h3>
<p>(Moscow, TASS, November 14) Tolstoy was a world-renowned writer. He passed away in the small room of the stationmaster at Astapovo station on November 20th, twenty-five years ago, leaving behind only his villa. In his diary, this great writer once recorded such an incident: in a dream, he buried his own fear and shame in front of the oppressed people in the desert because he was powerless to liberate enslaved Russia. Tolstoy's philosophical and religious views, of course, cannot be accepted by the working masses, but his works, especially his novels, have had a wide circulation since the October Revolution. Lenin repeatedly praised the importance of Tolstoy's works, exposing the oppression of the Tsarist government and revealing the deep contradictions between the rich and the poor. At the same time, Lenin also vigorously attacked his doctrine of non-resistance and his social thought. After the establishment of the Soviet government, even during the civil war, the circulation of Tolstoy's works increased. 700,000 copies of his books were published this year. In the past seventeen years, 11,650,000 copies of Tolstoy's works have been published in thirty-two different languages in the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has decided to ask Tolstoy's close friend, Chertkov, to compile Tolstoy's complete works in ninety-five volumes. These include thirteen volumes of Tolstoy's diaries that have never been published before. During the 25th anniversary of Tolstoy's death, factories and cultural institutions in the Soviet Union gave lectures and reports on Tolstoy's life and works. Exhibitions of Tolstoy's works were held in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities. Tolstoy's former residence has been turned into a museum by the Soviet government. All the furnishings are exactly the same as when Tolstoy was alive. Tens of thousands of workers in the Soviet Union visit this residence every year. Now the Soviet government is also going to issue commemorative stamps for Tolstoy. A grand memorial service for Tolstoy will be held in Moscow on November 20th. On the 21st, Soviet writers and artists will visit Tolstoy's residence again.</p>
<h3>New Air Route from Crimea to the Caucasus</h3>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Celebrates its Seventh Anniversary</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a ceremony at 11:00 AM on the 5th to celebrate its seventh anniversary. Central representative Wu Jingheng, National Government representative Deng Jiayan, and guests Qin Zhen, Jiao Yitang, Chen Zhaoying, Ma Chaojun, and Wang Yongbin attended. All members of the Legislative Yuan and staff, led by President Sun, participated. Beforehand, the Yuan decorated the entrance and auditorium with pine branches and colorful flowers. After President Sun presided over the ceremony and led the attendees in paying their respects, he delivered a report, first describing the general situation of the Legislative Yuan in the past year, and finally encouraging his colleagues to intensify the work of the Legislative Yuan, enrich the spirit of legislation, and continue to serve the country, so as to find a way out for the country and the nation in difficult and dangerous situations. Wu Jingheng and Deng Jiayan gave speeches, praising the satisfactory achievements of the Legislative Yuan in the past and informing them that the central government had resolved to accept the entire draft constitution formulated by the Legislative Yuan and scheduled it to be announced on May 5th of next year. Their hard work in drafting the constitution seemed to have received great consolation. After the speeches, all members of the Legislative Yuan applauded enthusiastically. Qin Zhen said that legislation is the work of nation-building, assisting all members of the Legislative Yuan to continue to shoulder the important task of nation-building. He also elaborated on his views on reforming China's judiciary after returning from his trip to Europe, explaining the misunderstandings caused in the legislative community in the past, and hoped that all members of the Legislative Yuan would go deep into the people and publicize the legislative spirit of the draft constitution before it is promulgated, in order to win the people's approval. Wang Yongbin said in his speech that he expressed his appreciation to his old colleagues in the Legislative Yuan, apart from praising his personal service in the Examination and Judicial Yuan after leaving the Legislative Yuan, he has strictly enforced the law and is worthy of the trust. He also regarded not participating in drafting the constitution as a matter of regret. Finally, he hoped that legislation should change with the times and facts, and especially hoped that the laws on compulsory execution, prison detention centers, and bar associations would be passed as soon as possible. The ceremony ended at 12:00 noon. They then went to the West Garden of the Yuan for a group photo. President Sun invited all participants to a meal at the Yuan. During the meal, they raised their glasses and made toasts, with both solemnity and humor, and everyone had a good time before dispersing. After the meal, various entertainment activities were performed, and the atmosphere was warm. The Yuan announced that the 5th would be a holiday to celebrate, and the regular meeting on the 6th would also be suspended. (Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Authorities Devise Methods to Stabilize Foreign Exchange, Nationalize Private Silver, Establish Foreign Exchange Reserve Committee</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Legislative Council resolved on the 5th to purchase silver from the people and establish a Foreign Exchange Reserve Committee to stabilize foreign exchange rates. Individuals are prohibited from holding more than ten dollars in silver; violators will be detained and fined. Future transactions will be limited to legal tender and banknotes from the three banks of HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Mercantile Bank. A Foreign Exchange Advisory Committee will be established to determine exchange rates. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong government issued an order today to nationalize privately held silver and establish an exchange control fund. Although this measure does not explicitly stipulate the stabilization of the Hong Kong dollar's value, its effect will grant the Financial Secretary full authority to manage exchange rates. It is noted that on November 9th, the Hong Kong government prohibited the export of all kinds of silver. Today's move is merely the second step in that direction. The government order briefly states that all note-issuing banks should hand over all silver coins and large silver bars held as banknote reserves to the Hong Kong Treasury. The Treasury will issue securities in exchange. Under the Treasury's management, an exchange fund will be established to adjust the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar. The Financial Secretary will consult with the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on management matters. The Financial Secretary will chair the committee, and other members will be appointed by the Governor of Hong Kong. All silver coins and silver bars turned over to the Treasury will be paid into the Exchange Fund, and payments for the surrendered silver will also be made from the Exchange Fund. Anyone holding British silver dollars, Mexican silver dollars, Hong Kong subsidiary coinage, or silver bars with a value exceeding ten dollars must hand them over to the Treasury within one month. Those who pay in silver coins will receive Hong Kong banknotes at face value, while those who pay in silver bars will receive Hong Kong banknotes at a price of one dollar and twenty-eight cents per ounce. Violators will be subject to imprisonment for up to one year, confiscation of silver coins and silver bars, and a fine of up to twice the value of the confiscated items. All or part of this Exchange Fund may be held in Hong Kong banknotes or other currencies, or the Financial Secretary may use it to purchase securities approved by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Financial Secretary may buy and sell such currencies or securities, but all such transactions must be for immediate delivery. The Financial Secretary may borrow money for the Exchange Fund, but the amount of debt may not exceed HK$30 million. Those holding Treasury licenses may deposit silver. The Financial Secretary may permit anyone to store silver in an amount deemed necessary for their business. The Attorney General of Hong Kong, Alabaster, issued a statement regarding this order, explaining its purpose and reasons. He stated that the purpose of this order is to establish the government's control over Hong Kong's foreign exchange to prevent improper fluctuations. Legally issued bank notes should be legal tender locally. Note-issuing banks must turn over all silver coins and silver bars previously held as note reserves to the Treasury, which will issue them with bonds as collateral for the notes. These bonds, issued under the Currency Ordinance of 1935, are a type of non-interest-bearing debt instrument of the Hong Kong government, which the Hong Kong Financial Secretary may redeem at his discretion. When presenting the Exchange Fund proposal, the Attorney General stated that if the Hong Kong market were only for the use of the Hong Kong people, the currency in its current abnormal state might be allowed to exist until the world situation clears up. However, this market is not like that, and the Hong Kong dollar is in danger of being subject to violent fluctuations due to the activities of speculators from other ports, which may harm the interests of legitimate trade in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong authorities recently discussed coping methods in detail with the leaders of the three note-issuing banks, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank. The leaders of the three banks fully agreed to establish an Exchange Fund under the chairmanship of the Financial Secretary, supplemented by an advisory committee. The Exchange Fund established in this way will receive all cash silver, and after the cash silver is nationalized, no one holding cash silver can export it. In the future, when the system is fully established and the silver export ban can be cancelled, there may be profits and losses arising from the sale of silver. The Hong Kong government has decided on the only correct method: to use the silver reserves to pay for banknotes. All profits and losses on the handling of this silver reserve will belong to the Exchange Fund. The prices at which the Exchange Fund buys and sells foreign exchange will not be made public. All fund accounts will be audited according to the methods approved by the Secretary of State. All profits and losses arising from the operation of this fund will be listed in the government accounts. (5th Reuter's dispatch)</p>

<h3>Historical Facts of Competition Among Britain, France, and Italy in Abyssinia (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "He who laughs last laughs best"; the winner of a race can also be disqualified. Abyssinian soldiers garrisoned in the sandy lowlands ran out of provisions, and then a major flood occurred, so they dropped their national flag and hurried away. Marchand still held out, but he had no large army to help him. Kitchener, after severely defeating the Muslims who were blocking his way, led his victorious soldiers in a mighty march to Fashoda. The French government then ordered the stubborn Marchand to retreat as soon as he saw an opportunity. As a result, the English flag flew firmly over Fashoda, and to this day, it still waves in the wind, and from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo, all are within the reach of British power. France has been relegated to a secondary position in East Africa.</p>
<p>In the meantime, France used rifles to assist Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia in destroying a branch of the Italian army that had invaded Abyssinia from the north. In 1897, France also concluded a friendship agreement with Abyssinia, stipulating that Djibouti would be the official port of the Abyssinian Empire. Once the new railway is built, the commerce of an area larger than any country in Europe except Russia will be entirely transported to a French port. Menelik's move was tantamount to giving the key to his country to Paris. Furthermore, French merchants could enjoy preferential treatment in Abyssinia, and France also obtained other privileges. The construction of the new road began. These were all things that happened before Kitchener arrived at Fashoda. After Kitchener arrived at Fashoda, British prestige increased in East Africa, and the British representative in the Abyssinian capital became very active.</p>
<p>In 1902, Britain and Menelik concluded a preferential treaty regarding the use of water from the Blue Nile River and even obtained the right to build a railway from the British colony of Zeila through Abyssinia to Sudan. This was a terrible obstacle in the middle of the French railway, making Djibouti seem no longer to be the main gateway to Abyssinia. At the same time, the French company failed, and the railway project was stopped. Later, France reached an understanding with the other two most relevant major powers, allowing France to build roads to the Abyssinian capital, but not to approach the Nile River, allowing Britain to use the waters of Lake Tana and the Blue Nile, and allowing Italy to enjoy most of the economic concessions in Abyssinia and to build a crescent-shaped railway from Eritria in the north through western Abyssinia to Italian Somaliland in the south. In the future, if the Abyssinian Empire split up, each country could do whatever it wanted within its designated sphere of influence. At first, Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia knew nothing about this treaty and never recognized it. Although this treaty became the basis of relations between Abyssinia and the great powers, it was still a secret document.</p>
<p>In 1908, although Menelik was extremely unwilling, he finally concluded a treaty with France regarding the railway project. Nine years later, after extreme hardship, the Djibouti to Abyssinian capital railway was fortunately completed. This enterprise now belongs to the French Republic and is very profitable. This is the only real result of a hundred years of international intrigue. This road now transports 80% of the trade goods between Abyssinia and foreign countries and transports 95% of the travelers entering and leaving Abyssinia. The shares total 34,000 shares, and 2,500 shares were transferred to Italy earlier this year.</p>
<p>In 1915, France and Britain concluded a secret treaty in London, guaranteeing Italy that if it joined the Allied Powers in World War I, it would enjoy rich benefits in Abyssinia. France never fulfilled its promise, but earlier this year, it granted Italy some trivial land concessions, seeming to allow Italy freedom of action in Abyssinia.</p>
<p>In 1923, when the League of Nations discussed Abyssinia's accession, France spoke highly of Abyssinia. In short, no major power has helped Abyssinia as much as France. (Translated from an article by R.H. Markham in the Christian Science Monitor)</p>

<h3>Vietnam Levies Heavy Import Duties on Chinese Silk</h3>

<h3>Taiwan Commodity Shipments to Xiamen Decrease</h3>
<p>From Over 400 Pieces to 200 Pieces; Water Passengers Carrying Goods Also Decreasing</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Xiamen and Taiwan are only separated by a strait. Ships can arrive in just twelve hours. Consequently, the number of Taiwanese products and Japanese goods passing through Taiwan to Xiamen has been extremely large. Besides agricultural products and bulky items stored in warehouses, textiles and sundries were mostly carried by so-called "water passengers." As a result, each ship arriving from Taiwan often had five or six hundred passengers who came specifically to carry goods. The goods were all packed in luggage. Customs inspections often clashed with these water passengers, resulting in significant tax evasion. This summer, the Xiamen Customs Commissioner and the Japanese Consul agreed on an accord regarding Taiwanese water passengers carrying goods, limiting each ship to four hundred people, each allowed to carry four cubic meters of goods. Before the implementation of legal tender (fa bi), foreign exchange rates were extremely high, with 130-140 Japanese yen being worth 100 Chinese yuan. Due to the low exchange rate of the Japanese yen, dumping was effective, and Japanese goods flooded in. After the agreement was implemented and taxes were levied per item, each ship still had two to three hundred water passengers, carrying around 400 pieces of goods. Since the implementation of legal tender, foreign exchange rates have been suppressed, with 100 Chinese yuan being worth only 103 Japanese yen, and the rate is stable. The profits from Taiwanese goods coming to Xiamen are no longer as substantial as before. Furthermore, customs inspections for silver are extremely strict. Each ship departing often has three to five thousand yuan worth of silver discovered. Therefore, the number of Taiwanese water passengers coming to Xiamen with goods has been decreasing daily recently. In the past two weeks, each ship has had no more than a hundred water passengers, sometimes only dozens, and the number of goods has decreased from over four hundred pieces to just over two hundred or a hundred pieces. In addition, in the past month, customs have uncovered silver ingots and silver dollars worth over 50,000 yuan in total. Other items, such as smuggled white sugar, kerosene, textiles, matches, ginseng, seafood, beef tendons, medicinal materials, and ships, are estimated at around 100,000 yuan. On the 3rd, the ship departing from Guangdong bound for Taiwan only uncovered over 500 yuan worth of silver, which is also much less than before. (December 4th)</p>
<h3>Fujianese People Oppose the Imposition of Rice Tax</h3>
<p>Zhangzhou-Shima Rice Tax Has Already Been Implemented; Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Discussing Relief Measures</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, December 1st: The date for the Fujian Provincial Government to implement the rice tax in Zhangzhou Prefecture. Rice merchants in Zhangzhou and Shima have risen up in opposition. Prior to this, they resolved to suspend purchasing rice from rural areas and exporting rice for ten days, starting from November 26th, and scheduled another meeting for December 5th to discuss further actions. It is understood that only Zhangzhou Prefecture in Fujian Province produces rice. Since the imposition of import duties on foreign rice, Xiamen and Quanzhou have relied exclusively on Zhangzhou rice, abandoning foreign rice. In Xiamen City alone, the daily demand is a thousand bags. Since the rice merchants in Zhangzhou and Shima have suspended transportation, rice prices in Xiamen have risen immediately. As of the 3rd, each dan (a unit of weight) has increased by half a yuan compared to the previous week, and by around two yuan compared to the previous month. Over a hundred Shima rice ships have suspended operations due to the transportation stoppage, and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Including family members, no less than several thousand people are facing threats to their livelihoods. Overseas Chinese businessmen Lin Bingxiang, Hu Wenhu, Chen Yanqian, and Xiamen University President Lin Wenqing jointly telegraphed the central and provincial governments, requesting the withdrawal of the order. On November 30th, the provincial government replied by telegram, stating approximately: "The Zhangzhou Prefecture national expenditure surcharges have been excessively numerous and the tax amounts have been heavy. Now, to alleviate the burden on the people, an order has been issued to abolish them all from December 1st. The funds for the local defense forces will be managed centrally by the provincial government. At this time of depleted financial resources, it has been resolved to implement a rice tax in Zhangzhou Prefecture to slightly offset the deficit. We hope for your understanding and support as much as possible." On December 1st, rice tax collection bureaus were established and implemented in Zhangzhou and Shima. On the same day, the provincial government issued an order to abolish thirty-seven types of security surcharges and miscellaneous taxes in Zhangzhou Prefecture, including: (1) Longxi security fee, West Creek business tax surcharge, Shima business tax surcharge, North Creek business tax surcharge, Hongdong business tax surcharge, sugar industry business tax surcharge, Northwest Creek paper industry business tax surcharge, Shima livestock tax surcharge, Zhangzhou guard donation surcharge of 10%, Jinzhou vehicle donation surcharge of 10%, surcharges for various township apportionment red material donations, banquet surcharge of 10%, firecracker donation surcharge of 10%, newspaper surcharge, ash donation surcharge, Shima gold leaf donation surcharge of 10%, Zhangzhou flower donation surcharge of 10%, Shima flower guard donation surcharge of 10%; (2) Security troop fees, West Creek business tax surcharge of 20%, North Creek business tax surcharge of 20%, West Creek paper industry tax surcharge of 20%, Zhangzhou tobacco and alcohol tax surcharge of 20%, fruit business surcharge of 20%, Shima livestock surcharge of 20%, Jiangdong business tax surcharge of 20%, Shima business surcharge of 20%, red material donation surcharge of 20%, banquet donation surcharge of 20%, firecracker donation surcharge of 20%, ash donation surcharge of 20%, Shima gold leaf donation surcharge of 20%, daffodil surcharge of 20%, Zhangzhou flower donation surcharge of 20%, Shima flower donation surcharge of 20%, Zhangzhou seafood surcharge of 20%, Zhangzhou sugar industry tax surcharge of 20%, Zhangzhou guard donation surcharge of 20%, Zhangzhou vehicle donation of 20%, as well as vegetable and cattle donations, etc.</p>
<p>The first to be affected by the rice merchants' transportation stoppage is Xiamen. As of the 3rd, the city's rice reserves are only sufficient to last for one week. The Rice Industry Association met with the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce on the 3rd, requesting that the city's various trade associations be convened quickly to discuss relief measures, and that a telegram be sent again in the name of the general assembly to the National Government's Ministry of Finance and the Rural Reconstruction Committee, as well as the provincial government, to immediately abolish the rice tax to benefit the people's food supply and avoid a rice panic. After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce decided to convene a general assembly on the 5th to discuss the matter. At the same time, the Shima civilian ship and steamship associations also telegraphed the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and the Fujian-Zhejiang Surveillance Commissioner, stating approximately that the rice ship stoppage had resulted in thousands of people losing their jobs and requesting the withdrawal of the rice tax order. According to the Financial Department's plan this summer to reorganize Fujian Province's finances, the total amount of security troop fees, surcharges, and miscellaneous taxes for all counties in the province is over two million yuan annually. In reality, the burden on the people is even greater. It was decided that, in addition to retaining the land tax and slaughter tax surcharges to be directly remitted to the provincial treasury, all other items would be abolished, and the troop fees would be directly allocated by the provincial government. The plan was approved by the provincial government and scheduled to be implemented on December 1st. However, there are ten security troops and civilian militias in each county, and the expenses are very large. Therefore, it was agreed to collect a rice tax in Zhangzhou Prefecture as one of the ways to offset the deficit. The Zhangzhou Prefecture rice tax originated during Chen Jiongming's驻漳州 (stationed in Zhangzhou) era in the 7th year of the Republic (1918), and continued until the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). In order to protect rural areas, the central government levied import duties on foreign rice and promoted the circulation of rice throughout the country, and ordered the abolition of rice taxes throughout the country. The Jinzhou Prefecture rice tax was abolished at this time. This current implementation is in reality a re-imposition. (December 4th)</p>

<p>Sheng Yinsheng, a resident of Cai Gengshang, the seventh Jia of the fifth Bao of Meicun Township in the Second District (from Jiangyin, over fifty years old, with a limp), who has been guarding the ancestral hall for Cai Jinyuan, was suddenly approached by more than ten bandits around one o'clock in the evening the other day. The bandits were wearing headscarves and blue cloth clothes, looking like fishermen from Jiangbei. Each was carrying a wooden club or short knife. After breaking down the door, they immediately restrained Yinsheng, stripped him of his clothes, tied him up with rope, and threatened him into silence. They wantonly searched and looted the premises. In the end, they stole over ten dan of rice, as well as clothes and other items, resulting in a loss of over two hundred yuan. However, because Yinsheng was tied up naked, he could not withstand the cold and no one came to his rescue. By dawn, he was on the verge of death. As of now, the case has not been reported to the county for arrest and investigation. In addition, the home of Cao Xingren, located in a thatched shack near the Shiqiao mound in the Tenth District, was also robbed by five bandits who entered the premises to carry out their robbery. Afterwards, police officers Sun Chuan'ying and others from the Wuqiao Police Station of the Fifth Sub-bureau and the Dawangmiao guard post apprehended the bandits Qian Zirong, Cao Rongzhang, Hu Shengbao, Chen Amao, and Zhao Renbao, and transferred them to the main bureau. On the 5th, they were transferred to the court for interrogation and detention. Furthermore, the vehicle patrol team of the Sixth Security Brigade apprehended two thugs, Li Chao and Yu Xiuzhen, near Dongting on the 5th and handed them over to the county government. The newly appointed county magistrate, Long Tiyao, personally held a court hearing, and as a result, ordered them to be detained together, pending investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Specifies Dates for Opium Offenders to Turn Themselves In</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs previously drafted measures for the general inspection and self-renewal registration of opium offenders and submitted them to the provincial government for discussion, approval, and implementation, ordering all counties to comply. It is now known that the department has set January 1, 1936 as the starting date for the self-renewal registration of opium offenders and February 1, 1936 as the date for the general inspection of opium offenders. A special order has been issued to all counties to comply and make it known to the public.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Unauthorized Arrest of Reporter Causes Dispute</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of winter defense, the county's Public Security Bureau has repeatedly caused disputes due to inspections. On the night of the 2nd, the unauthorized arrest of Ma Zetian and two others, the editor-in-chief of the China Daily and a part-time staff member of the county party headquarters, caused a dispute. Therefore, the Daily Newspaper Association is paying special attention to this matter. Because reporters work mostly late at night, if such arrests continue to occur, all reporters will feel threatened. Therefore, a notice was issued on the 4th, convening all colleagues to hold an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss a response.</p>
<h3>Nantong, Cold Weather and Hail in Various Counties of Nantong Prefecture</h3>
<p>On the 4th, the weather was cold and overcast in the various counties of the Nantong Prefecture in Jiangbei. Around 5:00 PM, hail suddenly fell and lasted for half an hour. The cold air has increased, and there is a possibility of snow.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Scientific Research Undertakings (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ding Wenjiang, Director-General of the Academia Sinica</p>
<p>(Speech to Students of Chinese Secondary Schools on November 26th)</p>
<p>The First Geological Survey is an extremely poor organization. When it began to organize in the fifth year of the Republic (1916), it was expected to receive 120,000 yuan per year. From the fifth year of the Republic to the fifteenth year of the Republic, the actual funding received each year averaged only 50,000 yuan. At the lowest point, it was less than 30,000 yuan. Even now, the funding provided by the government is only 72,000 yuan. The difficulties faced by those involved can be imagined. However, it is precisely because of its poverty that it has avoided much political interference. Because funding is low, salaries are relatively low, and fieldwork is an extremely arduous task. From very early on, everyone knew that the Geological Survey was extremely demanding but the treatment was very poor. At first, some people would randomly recommend people to the director, but later, unless someone was truly interested in geology, they would shake their heads and be unwilling to join when the Geological Survey was mentioned. Therefore, in a very turbulent political environment, the Geological Survey was able to avoid being infected by it. Since the Republic, the heads of any government organization have often changed. However, the Geological Survey has only ever had two directors. The current director, Mr. Weng Wenhao, has been in office for fourteen years. The ministers and acting ministers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and the Ministry of Industry, who have jurisdiction over him, have changed more than twenty times! Because it is poor, it cannot support idlers, so the director can remain in his position for a long time. This is the first condition for the success of the Geological Survey.</p>
<p>Second, since its establishment, the Geological Survey has focused on practical problems. Not only have they discovered many new mines, but those who survey geology and mineral resources are constantly helping those who develop mines. Whether it is surveying mine area maps or geological maps, analyzing mineral properties, or determining drilling locations, as long as they are genuine mine developers, the Geological Survey is willing to help them work and plan. Neither individuals nor organizations receive any compensation. Therefore, people in the mining industry all know that the Geological Survey is their friend. When political difficulties arise, everyone comes out to speak for it. Moreover, in these twenty years, private donations to it have amounted to nearly 200,000 yuan. The library, dissection room, paleontology and fuel research laboratory, and seismology room of the Geological Survey in Beiping were all built with private donations. It is likely that the Geological Survey is the only government research organization to receive such large amounts of private donations.</p>
<p>Third, the Geological Survey is able to fully utilize foreign scholars. In recent years, many young people studying science have been influenced by nationalism and are often unwilling to cooperate with or be guided by foreigners. They do not know that this is a big mistake. Science was originally a product of Western Europe. Europeans and Americans have been studying science for at least 150 years. We have only been doing it for twenty years. Of course, they are better than us, and we must cooperate with and be guided by foreigners in order to have any hope of catching up with them. Conversely, many government organizations employ foreigners but often cannot use them and are used by them. They do not know that although foreigners are better than us, they do not speak Chinese and do not know the needs of China. Without a competent Chinese leader to direct them, not only will they not be able to use their talents to the fullest, but they will also cause problems. Moreover, although most foreign scientists are better than us, few of them are able to guide us and are also willing to come to China. The foreigners employed by the Geological Survey are all first-class talents who cooperate with their Chinese colleagues under the direction of the leaders, so they are able to achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned conditions are important, without a director who is willing to sacrifice himself, the Geological Survey would certainly not have achieved its current success. During the most difficult times for the Geological Survey, from the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925) to the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), Mr. Weng Wenhao did not take any salary at all. Twenty-three years ago, the director was a recommended official, but Mr. Weng was unwilling to leave the Geological Survey, so he was unwilling to become the president of Tsinghua University and the Minister of Education. Currently, the director has been changed to a simplified appointment official, but Mr. Weng is taking the lowest salary of a simplified appointment official. This kind of spirit has naturally spread to the hearts of all the employees of the institute. Many people would rather take less salary than be willing to leave the Geological Survey. Those who do fieldwork consider enduring hardship and taking risks as extremely ordinary things. In the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929), Mr. Zhao Yahui was dispatched to Sichuan and Yunnan. He would rather be killed by bandits in Zhaotong than give up the original investigation plan. In the winter of the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), Mr. Wang Hengsheng was arrested by Russian troops on the border of Heilongjiang as a spy and imprisoned in a Siberian prison, drinking cold water and eating black bread for eighteen days, almost being shot twice. After he was released, when he arrived in Manzhouli, he continued to do his fieldwork as usual. He did not return until the planned plan was implemented. This kind of spirit is the foundation of our nation's revival. I hope that every young person knows these facts and learns from their example.</p>
<p>The scientific research organization that was established after the Geological Survey was the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China. The Science Society of China was organized by Chinese students studying in the United States in the fourth year of the Republic (1915) and established in Ithaca, New York. In the seventh year of the Republic (1918), the operating organization moved from the United States to China. At that time, the business was to compile and print a popular magazine called "Science." In the ninth year of the Republic (1920), Mr. Bing Zhi returned from the United States to serve as a professor of zoology at Southeast University. Mr. Bing was one of the founders of the Science Society and one of the first directors. He was the most enthusiastic researcher, but Southeast University was originally a higher normal school, and not only were the equipment and facilities very simple, the buildings were very small, but also the teaching was very heavy, and the authorities did not have the ability to promote research work. Therefore, Mr. Bing wanted to use the Science Society as a base for studying biology. Coincidentally, the Ministry of Finance allocated the official property in Wende Lane, Chengxian Street, Nanjing to the Science Society for its office. In addition to offices and libraries, there were also a few remaining houses. Mr. Bing, together with his friend Mr. Hu Xiansiu, a professor of botany at Southeast University, proposed to organize a biological research institute within the Science Society. It was established in the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), with Mr. Bing as the director and Mr. Hu as a researcher. At that time, the Biological Research Institute only occupied two small houses, and the annual funding was only 240 yuan! Mr. Bing and Mr. Hu not only did not receive salaries, but also, together with their friends Mr. Chen Huanxi and Mr. Chen Zhen, each took out their own books and placed them in the Science Society as a public library. The necessary instruments and medicines were borrowed from Southeast University. During the day, they were busy teaching and had no time, so they ran to the institute after dinner in the evening to work. In the twelfth year of the Republic (1923), they obtained two more larger rooms from the Science Society to serve as display rooms. In the autumn of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to subsidize them with 300 yuan per month. From the twelfth year to the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), the total annual funding for the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society was only 3,840 yuan, but Mr. Bing and his friends separately took charge of various tasks such as collection, display, and research, and published eight papers one after another. Their work was done at night and in the summer, because they were busy teaching at other times. I still remember that in the summer of the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), the Science Society held its tenth anniversary conference at the Nanjing Institute. The weather was extremely hot that day, and it was impossible to sit in the house, so all the procedures of the meeting were held in the open air. After dinner, various games and entertainment were held. I looked everywhere for Mr. Bing but could not see his shadow. Later, I learned that he and his assistants were hidden upstairs holding their microscopes! Soon, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War broke out, and Nanjing was repeatedly panicked, but Mr. Bing and his colleagues not only did not move their homes to escape, but also worked as usual every day without interruption.</p>
<p>From the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926) until now, the Science Society has received subsidies from the China Education and Culture Foundation, and the funding has gradually become more abundant than before. The first subsidy was 15,000 yuan per year, and currently it is 46,000 yuan, but at most it is only 50,000 yuan. On the one hand, the Biological Research Institute constantly sends people to collect specimens in the field, and on the other hand, it builds new houses and increases equipment. Now the instruments and display rooms are roughly equipped, and more than 90 papers have been published, with a collection of thousands of books and more than 50,000 specimens. The economy of expenditure can be said to be "worlds apart" from that of general government organizations.</p>
<p>The work of the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society mainly focuses on classification. In recent years, some people have criticized Mr. Bing, thinking that his work is too unfashionable and too narrow. This criticism is unfair. It is true that in European and American countries, the taxonomy of flora and fauna is already outdated. However, this is because they have figured out the types and distribution of the flora and fauna in their own countries over the past two hundred years. It is not that taxonomy is unimportant. We have just begun. For example, nothing is more practical than fisheries, agriculture, and forestry in terms of its relationship with flora and fauna. If we cannot even explain how many kinds of fish, trees, or pests there are, how can we talk about application or advanced studies? Mr. Bing's work in classification is a sacrifice for him personally, because he originally studied morphology, and his personal interest was not in classification. The scope of botany and zoology is too broad. It is impossible to include all kinds of research work in one organization. What's more, his funding is only 46,000 yuan per year!</p>
<p>I have already said at the beginning that the number of research organizations in China is gradually increasing. The reason why I only talk about the Geological Survey and the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society is that, firstly, there is not enough time, and secondly, I personally know these two organizations particularly clearly, especially since both of them have gone through difficult and arduous creation. I am not "flaunting" my friends, their achievements are there, and they do not need anyone to flaunt them. I want to let ambitious young people know these facts and be inspired by them. I often say to middle-aged people: Modern young people are better than us. I also want to say to young people: Society is not completely evil, and the spirit of a few seniors in doing things and learning is enough to be a model for young people.</p>

<h3>City Party Headquarters Convened Yesterday Memorial Meeting for the Uprising of the Zhaohe Warship, Over 100 Representatives From All Walks of Life Attended, Wang Manyun Reported on the Significance of the Commemoration</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: At 10:00 AM on the 5th, the City Party Headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life in the city at the auditorium to hold a memorial meeting for the 20th anniversary of the Zhaohe Warship Uprising. The meeting was presided over by Wang Manyun, a member of the Municipal Committee, who reported on the significance of the commemoration, and then shouted slogans before adjourning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Those present included Wang Manyun of the Municipal Committee, Du Shaowen of the Education Bureau, Lin Kecong of the Municipal Women's Association, Huang Xianggu of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Huang Zhaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, Yu Yaoqiu of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and other representatives from various organizations, schools, party headquarters at all levels, and staff members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, totaling over a hundred people. Wang Manyun presided over the meeting, Lin Kecong served as the master of ceremonies, and Du Mengsen took the minutes.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the ceremonial procedures, the chairman first reported that after the founding of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai seized power and took various measures that violated public opinion and oppressed revolutionary forces, making the Republic of China only in name but not in reality. He filled key positions with his cronies in order to realize his imperial dream. On this day twenty years ago, Mr. Chen Yingli led an uprising in Shanghai, first assassinating the Garrison Commander Zheng Rucheng, and then occupying the Zhaohe Warship in the Huangpu River to launch an attack against the warlords at the time. However, due to being outnumbered, despite advancing on both land and water, they were ultimately unable to sustain the effort and declared failure. Because the Zhaohe Warship Uprising caused a sensation throughout the country, the warlords did not dare to despise the courage and righteousness of the revolutionaries. At the same time, it encouraged patriots across the country to prepare to fight against the warlords. Therefore, the Zhaohe Uprising is indeed an important page in the history of the revolution. The seriousness of the national crisis today is even greater than in the past. All of us revolutionaries should strive even harder to save the nation and achieve the goals of freedom and equality.</p>
<p>Commemorative Slogans: (1) The Zhaohe Uprising was the precursor to the Yunnan Uprising; (2) The Zhaohe Uprising was a revolutionary movement against autocracy; (3) Commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising by uniting sincerely; (4) Commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising by striving for political tutelage and construction; (5) Long live the Three Principles of the People; (6) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party; (7) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Security Department Party Headquarters: Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising. The Executive Committee of the Security Department Party Headquarters convened representatives from party headquarters and local defense units at all levels to hold a memorial meeting at the headquarters auditorium. The meeting was presided over by Zeng Zesheng, a member of the Standing Committee, who reported on the course of the uprising and its significance in great detail. This was followed by a speech by Lu Jie, the secretary-general of the association, whose words were cautionary. After shouting slogans, the meeting adjourned. In addition, Yang Xiaotian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Supervisory Committee of the Party Headquarters, who participated in the uprising on that day, is currently attending the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. However, he cannot forget the difficult struggle of the uprising and the tragic sacrifices of the martyrs. He sent many printed materials from Beijing to show his commitment, with many encouraging words. Readers were deeply moved.</p>
<p>Railway Party Headquarters: Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of the Zhaohe Warship Uprising. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Party Headquarters held a memorial meeting in the auditorium yesterday, with over a hundred attendees including all the executive and supervisory committee members, staff members, and representatives from various employee groups and schools. Li Dasan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Party Headquarters, presided over the meeting, led the attendees in performing the ceremonies, and then reported on a brief history of the Zhaohe Warship Uprising and its significance. This was followed by a speech by Comrade Wang Cheng, which is not recorded in detail. Then, they shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3>Real Department: Adjusting Mining Finance</h3>
<p>More Than a Dozen Cases Approved; Total Amount Estimated at 5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Industry has established a Mining Finance Adjustment Committee to handle 10 million yuan in commercial loans. The aim is to adjust the economic conditions of various mines, supervise improvements in their operations, and promote development. It is reported that many mines have requested loans. The committee has investigated and verified a dozen cases, which have been submitted to the Ministry for approval. The total amount of the loans is approximately 5 million yuan. The loan contracts have already been drafted and will be formally signed and submitted to the Ministry after the respective mines convene shareholder meetings and pass the resolutions. The Ministry will guarantee the repayment of principal and interest. The remaining mines are still under investigation. According to the person in charge of the committee, the collateral for the loans is the assets of the mines, with the Ministry of Industry as the guarantor. The Ministry will be responsible for repaying the principal and interest to the banking syndicate. Therefore, the committee, acting as a representative of the Ministry, will supervise the operations of the mines at any time. If a mine fails due to business failure and cannot repay the loan, the Ministry has the right to take over the mine's assets for reorganization and development. Although such provisions exist for the loans, the investigation and review processes are quite strict, so it is unlikely that such a situation will occur.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Finance and Construction Commissioners: Flew to Sichuan Together Yesterday Morning; Liu Discussed the Success of the 12 Million Yuan Loan; Lu Said the Date of Assuming the Construction Commissioner Position is Undecided</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Liu Hangchen, the Finance Commissioner of Sichuan Province and Deputy Director of the Finance Supervisory Office of the Military Affairs Commission, and Lu Zuofu, the Construction Commissioner and General Manager of Minsheng Industrial Company, recently flew to Shanghai for official business. They completed their tasks and took the China National Aviation Corporation's westward plane together at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, flying directly to Chongqing. Before departing, Liu told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency that Sichuan's finances have gradually improved since the central government decided to rectify them. The previous situation of spending without revenue has been completely reversed. All 60 million yuan of local banknotes issued by various armies and banks in the past, except for half of which had cash reserves, the remaining 30 million yuan were completely recovered by the Central Bank at 80% of their face value. After the deadline of November 15th, all local banknotes have completely disappeared from the market. This has led to a significant shortage of currency. At the same time, the volume of transactions is large, but the Central Bank's banknotes only amount to 24 million yuan, which is definitely not enough to meet the needs of circulation throughout Sichuan. Therefore, the financial community in Chongqing, on the one hand, plans to use a type of remittance certificate as a substitute for cash in Chongqing (totaling approximately 9 million yuan), and on the other hand, plans to apply to the Ministry of Finance to issue 35 million yuan in banknotes, with 60% cash and 40% guarantee reserves. Unexpectedly, after the Ministry of Finance announced the nationalization of silver on November 4th and implemented the new monetary policy, this banknote issuance plan was tacitly abandoned. However, the problem of currency shortage still needs to be resolved with a good solution. Therefore, I specifically flew to Shanghai a few days ago with Guan Jiyu, the Director of the Finance Supervisory Office of the Military Affairs Commission, and Kang Xinru, the General Manager of Sichuan Meifeng Bank (representing the financial community in Chongqing), to consult with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi. We have now obtained the approval of Minister Kong to use the 70 million yuan of Sichuan Rehabilitation Bonds issued by the government as collateral. In addition to the original 4 million yuan temporarily postponed for repayment, an additional 8 million yuan will be borrowed, totaling 12 million yuan. Four million yuan will be lent to the financial community in Chongqing, and 4 million yuan will be lent to the Sichuan reconstruction financial authorities for the purpose of recovering the remittance certificates circulating in Chongqing that are not redeemable. After I return to Sichuan, the Chongqing branch of the Central Bank can allocate the funds to alleviate the current difficulties. As for the fundamental solution in the future, we should take our time to plan it. Roughly speaking, we hope that the Central Bank can handle commodity mortgage and bill discounting, etc. Currently, Sichuan's tax revenue is approximately 6.9 million yuan per year, and expenditures are approximately 6.4 million yuan. Although this is the first time that the Sichuan Provincial Government has had a preliminary budget since its establishment, it is quite difficult to balance revenue and expenditure given the years of war, fires, and impoverishment of the people and finances in Sichuan, and the need to address various problems. As for the future of Sichuan's finances, first, it depends on whether the common disaster in Sichuan can be eliminated, and further, how to stabilize the people's lives. Second, it depends on the international situation and the changes in Shanghai's financial circles. If there are no problems with these two items, then it is very optimistic. Sichuan is rich in resources, but it lacks large amounts of capital for development and means to transport goods out of the province. We hope that Shanghai's financial community can invest more in construction. If managed properly, Sichuan is the most promising province. When the reporter spoke with Liu, Lu was in the room. The reporter then asked whether he had decided to take the position of Construction Commissioner. He replied that he was busy with company management and had limited knowledge, so he could not take on this important task. He had already submitted his resignation, but Chairman Liu repeatedly urged and exhorted him to reluctantly accept. He was in a dilemma and agreed to consider it further. Therefore, the date of assuming the position is temporarily uncertain. He will make a decision after returning to Sichuan and consulting with Chairman Liu.</p>
<h3>Postal Remittance Bureau: Sends Wang Xufu to Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Investigates Tung Oil Production</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Remittance Bureau and the Zhejiang Construction Department are in contact regarding the tung oil loan. Previously, Tang Xunze, the director of the Cooperation Office of the Zhejiang Construction Department, came to Shanghai and had several discussions with the Postal Remittance Bureau. Finally, it was decided that the Postal Remittance Bureau would no longer handle advance remittance loans. It agreed with the Zhejiang Construction Department's suggestion to change to production loans, and agreed to overdraft 30,000 yuan in national currency for this type of production loan. The loan will be provided to the cooperatives in various tung oil-producing counties, and then the cooperatives will transfer the goods to the tung oil farmers. Later, the tung oil farmers will use the tung oil obtained from pressing as collateral. For the sake of prudence, the Postal Remittance Bureau has sent Wang Xunan to various tung oil-producing counties in Zhejiang to investigate. After returning to Shanghai, he will proceed to sign the contract. It is reported that the initial overdraft loan will be issued.</p>
<h3>Consul General in Batavia: Song Faxiang Returned to His Post Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talked about the Promotion of National Products in Batavia; Future Looks Promising</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Song Faxiang, the Consul General of our country in Batavia, returned to China last month to attend the Fifth National Congress. After finishing his business, he came to Shanghai and was warmly welcomed by various industrial, commercial, and financial groups in Shanghai. Song also held a simple wedding the day before yesterday afternoon. At 8:30 AM yesterday morning, he and his new wife went to the Xinguang Wharf and boarded the "Chisadane" ship of the Java Shipping Company to return to Batavia. Many of Song's relatives and friends went to see him off. According to Song, the situation of the overseas Chinese in Batavia is still good. Currently, various manufacturers in China are planning to promote national products in Southeast Asia. This move is not only for developing national products, but also because overseas Chinese have a very urgent belief in and need for national products. I will do my best to assist in the process. As for the expanded national product tour exhibition next year, from the perspective of Batavia, August is the most suitable time. At that time, it is the Queen of the Netherlands Indies' birthday celebration, and there is usually a night market, with particularly prosperous business. Currently, Batavia's trade has shown an upward trend in terms of exports since the outbreak of the Abyssinian War. The Dutch Indies strictly restricts the import of foreign goods, and Japanese goods are being rejected in that country. The restrictions on our country have now been lifted, and the future looks promising.</p>
<h3>Three Banks Comply with the Order to Provide Overdrafts to Fellow Banks</h3>
<p>Quota Set at 20 Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, after the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were ordered to provide overdrafts to fellow banks, Xi Demao, the manager of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, and Zhang Peishen, the manager of the Business Bureau of the Bank of Communications, discussed the implementation methods and have all complied with the order and are handling the matter according to regulations. A temporary overdraft quota of 20 million yuan has been set, and fellow banks that have dealings with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and have sufficient collateral, can apply for overdrafts. After the commercial banks and native banks obtained the convenience of overdrafts, the financial situation became lively, and it is hoped that this year's difficulties can be overcome.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Establishes Silkworm Seed Loan with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>A Total of 200,000 Yuan Will Be Delivered in Two Batches</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, in order to implement the control of silk and relieve the rural economy, the Finance and Construction Departments of the Zhejiang Provincial Government borrowed money from 14 banks in Shanghai, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, China-South Bank, Continental Bank, Jincheng Bank, Salt Bank, Siming Bank, China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China National Products Bank, China General Commercial Bank, and China Reclamation Bank to purchase spring and autumn cocoons, which has been quite effective. Now, in view of the improvement in China's silk foreign trade and the sharp increase in exports and silk prices, farmers are bound to increase silkworm breeding next spring. Therefore, they have again borrowed 200,000 yuan from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for the spring silkworm seeds next year, which has been successful. On the 4th, contracts were signed with the branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Hangzhou. Ten thousand yuan will be delivered immediately, and the remaining ten thousand yuan will be delivered on the 15th. It is stipulated that the principal and interest will be fully repaid by the end of April next year. The funds will be handed over to the Silk Control Committee for the production and purchase of spring silkworm seeds in order to distribute them to farmers in various counties of Zhejiang Province for silkworm breeding. It is expected that the output of spring cocoons next year will increase compared to this year.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Mobilizes: Deadline for Investigating Opium Offenders Starts Yesterday; Aims to Complete Work Within Three Weeks</h3>
<p>In order to complete the registration of opium addicts by the end of the year as scheduled, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued a notice to all sub-bureaus, police stations, water patrols, and detective teams to vigorously investigate opium offenders within their respective jurisdictions. The general mobilization and investigation started yesterday. In order to expand the anti-opium publicity, simple anti-opium slogans are broadcast on various radio stations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>General Mobilization and Investigation Starts Yesterday: The Public Security Bureau has received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering the completion of the registration of opium addicts by the end of this year. As the deadline is approaching, it has instructed all sub-bureaus, police stations, water patrols, and detective teams to work hard within their respective jurisdictions and complete the mission of eliminating the atmosphere of opium within the limited time. The original text reads: "Since the Bureau implemented forced registration, a month has passed. The number of opium offenders arrested and ordered to register is only over 1,000. Recently, according to the investigation by personnel dispatched to various sub-bureaus, there are still many unregistered opium addicts within their jurisdictions, especially those who open opium dens for people to smoke. The registration work is an important key to the implementation of opium prohibition. The Bureau previously received Instruction No. 2385 from the Municipal Government, which was forwarded from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering the thorough completion of the opium addict registration work by the end of the 24th year of the Republic of China, which must not be delayed. It should be strictly followed and completed as scheduled. Now that the deadline is approaching, all unregistered opium addicts and those who secretly open opium dens have been repeatedly persuaded, but they still do not know how to repent, and they despise the anti-opium policy and are not afraid of the law. It is difficult to grant them leniency. If we do not strictly arrest them, it will be difficult to complete the registration work as scheduled. The chiefs of all sub-bureaus and police stations should immediately supervise their subordinates to intensify the investigation and arrest, so that all opium addicts in the city will be registered and all private opium dens will be eliminated. Once verified, they will be punished severely according to law. In addition to issuing orders separately and dispatching personnel to investigate, we hereby urgently order the □ Chief to strictly follow the instructions and handle the matter without delay."</p>
<p>Registered Opium Addicts May Reach 40,000: Starting yesterday, the Public Security Bureau's sub-bureaus, police stations, water patrols, and detective teams began a forced registration period for opium addicts, with a general mobilization to investigate opium offenders, traffickers, den operators, and those who use licenses for people to smoke. They aim to eliminate the atmosphere of opium in the city this year. It is understood that since the Public Security Bureau started handling the voluntary registration of opium addicts in July this year and the forced registration last month, the achievements in handling the registration of opium addicts for more than five months, according to the Bureau's accurate estimate, as of yesterday, the number of registered opium addicts has reached more than 28,000.

<h3>Native Banks Request Postponement of Repayment: Three Banks' Loans; 7 Million Yuan from Native Bank Reserves Has Been Repaid; It is Reported that the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications Have Agreed to the Request</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Ministry of Finance previously allocated 25 million yuan of the 24th Year of the Republic of China Financial Bonds to rescue the native banks, and organized the Native Bank Supervisory Committee to preside over it. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were responsible for 18 million yuan, various commercial banks were responsible for 4 million yuan, and the Native Bank Joint Reserve was responsible for 3 million yuan. Now the term has expired. In addition to the 3 million yuan from the Native Bank Reserve which has been repaid long ago, the 4 million yuan from various commercial banks was only repaid at the end of last month. As for the 18 million yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, although the Native Bank Supervisory Committee has sent letters urging repayment, various native banks have long-term loans with the credit of industry and commerce, and have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to settle interest and extend the term to the end of April next year. Therefore, they have also requested the Native Bank Supervisory Committee to temporarily postpone the repayment of the loans from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The committee has transferred the matter to the three banks for review. It is reported that the three banks have agreed to temporarily postpone the repayment.</p>
<h3>Cai Zengji Discusses with Various Parties: Reorganizing the Land System</h3>
<p>Cai Zengji, the Director of the Land Bureau of this city, has openly discussed the issue of reorganizing the land system in Shanghai, gathering ideas from various parties, hoping to make the system perfect. Recently, various parties have published opinions in the North China Daily News. Director Cai has discussed them in detail. As this newspaper believes that this matter concerns social issues, it has translated and described Director Cai's original text published in the North China Daily News as follows: On the 29th of last month, a gentleman published an opinion on the issue of land mortgage in the North China Daily News, advocating that the mortgagee must have direct and clear auction rights. His statement is very good. However, the draft proposal for the reform of land property mortgage suggested by this Bureau already contains this meaning in the section on the execution of mortgage rights. According to Article 2 of the proposed draft, it is clearly stipulated that "If the mortgagee has not received payment after the debt maturity date and has been approved to notify the mortgagor to proceed, and still has not made payment, he may directly hand it over to a well-known auction house in this city to execute the auction." This means that the auction can be carried out without the intervention of the court first. The court will only deal with the matter when new evidence of land ownership is discovered, causing disputes in the auction or mortgage. Even if the mortgage is handled in accordance with English law (English law advocates that the mortgagee has direct and clear auction rights), if there is a dispute and the defendant is Chinese, the handling of the dispute cannot be separated from Chinese law and Chinese courts. Article 873 of the Civil Code stipulates that "Any agreement stipulating that the ownership of the mortgaged property shall be transferred to the mortgagee when the debt maturity date has arrived and payment has not been made is invalid." Therefore, according to the current Chinese law, the Chinese people cannot privately enter into a mortgage contract and naturally transfer the ownership of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee. Even if Chinese law does not have this explicit provision, in terms of general law, according to international law and common customs, it has never allowed the people of a country to voluntarily waive their domestic laws and their protection. For example, British people in their own country cannot voluntarily waive the rights granted and enjoyed by British law and turn to Chinese law. This is clear evidence. Therefore, when a Chinese is the defendant, the case must be handled by a Chinese court and judged by Chinese law. The perpetual lease system (rather than trust deed) in which foreigners register in consulates and practice on behalf of nationals is unique to other countries. Under this system, cunning people often use illegal methods to steal deeds and implement mortgages, which is undeniable. The proposed plan can reduce these illegal events. Therefore, although the mortgagee and mortgagor have to go through a few more procedures and pay a little more fees, they would like to adopt it. Some say that if this proposal is implemented, the perpetual lease system may be hindered. This statement seems to be overly pessimistic. In fact, the gist of the proposal is sufficient to eliminate existing weaknesses and prevent registered owners and original owners from being estranged again. The perpetual lease system is actually benefited. If the registered owner is also the original owner, the matter is simple. The real right based on the perpetual lease has been fully demonstrated in law. The holder is the owner, and there is no dispute over the issue of real rights. The Bureau's plan is to improve the current laws and procedures regarding the execution of mortgage rights, but its fundamental purpose is to protect the interests of both the mortgagee and mortgagor. Although some say that mortgagees generally know how to protect their own interests, in reality, as stated in the previous article, it is difficult to talk about it easily. What the Bureau is currently formulating is only an outline. As for the detailed items and chapters, such as the fee collection, (the fee collection should be based on the workload), it should be further regulated in detail. As for how the mortgagee should execute legal rights, manage the land, collect rents, and various related procedures and provisions when the mortgagor fails to pay interest, they must be drafted separately when the proposal is decided and promulgated. The land system of this city is waiting to be rebuilt. There is no need to decorate it. To seek a fair and perfect system to protect property rights and end litigation, it is necessary to take time to carefully study it before hastily saying that it is perfect.</p>
<h3>Delegate to the Fifth National Congress: Li Zhendian Returned to Singapore Yesterday; Donated All Travel Expenses to the Flood Relief Fund</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Li Zhendian, a delegate to the Fifth National Congress from Singapore, is a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant who operates many businesses, such as the Great World Amusement Park, Tunan Company, and Changcheng Store, all of which Li serves as the general manager. This time he returned to China to participate in the Fifth National Congress. In view of the severe floods across the country, he specifically donated all 700 yuan of travel expenses issued by the Central Government to the relief fund and handed it over to the Relief Committee for distribution. Such kindness is commendable. After the meeting, he came to Shanghai and visited Shanghai's national product factories and Jinan University for several days, which was quite busy. According to a reporter, after returning to Singapore, he will invite local gentry to organize a large-scale national product company to directly handle sales for various manufacturers in Shanghai. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia like national products the most, because they are of good quality and beautiful, and the prices are more suitable for the needs of the general public. The manufacturers in Shanghai, on the one hand, do not have direct agents, and on the other hand, they lack publicity, resulting in poor sales. After he returns to Singapore, he will do his best to promote its realization and make the greatest efforts. The capital will be set at one million yuan, but how to proceed with the planning will be discussed after he returns to Singapore. It is learned that Li boarded the Conte Verde ship at 8:00 PM last night and is scheduled to set sail for Singapore at 7:00 AM this morning. Among those who went to the pier to see him off were Zhuang Pitang, a delegate to the Fifth National Congress (scheduled to return to Singapore around the 20th), Tang Jingsong of Overseas Chinese Bank, Peng Shengtian of Jinan University, Xie Jieying, and his son (currently at Fudan University), and many others.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Company: Received Telegram from He En Yesterday</h3>

<p>The Eurasia Aviation Company's No. 5 plane crashed in Lingtai, Gansu Province, on its way from Lanzhou to Xi'an on the 27th of last month. Previous reports have been published. It is now learned that He Yu, the machine and aviation team agent sent by the company to Lingtai to handle the aftermath of the accident, reported from the company's Pingliang radio station yesterday that the two passengers in the crashed plane had mild injuries after being examined by doctors, and are making good progress after treatment.

As for the cause of the accident, the telegram stated that it still needs a detailed study of the local situation for a considerable period of time, and will be telegraphed after obtaining the main points. The company has prepared sugar, food, and fruits and handed them over to the westward plane yesterday to be delivered, and sent telegrams to the two passengers to express condolences. The text of the telegram is as follows: "Telegram to President Ma Yusan and County Chief Guo Hanqing, passengers of plane No. 5 dropped by the plane. It is regrettable that our company suffered a natural disaster and the plane crashed, causing harm to you. In addition to dispatching engineers and hiring doctors to rescue and assist, we hereby send some sugar, food, and fruits by special plane to express our sincere condolences and wish you a speedy recovery. Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Company."</p>
<h3>Chuanshan Steamboat Encountered Danger</h3>
<p>Lost Propeller Yesterday Morning in Tongshan Waters; Company Dispatched Tugboat for Assistance, Expected to Arrive Tonight</p>
<p>The Chuanshan steamboat of the Chuanshan Steamboat Company departs from Shanghai every Wednesday to Chuanshan first, and then to Shipu and Haimen for export. The ship left Shanghai with cargo and passengers fully loaded last night. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, when the ship arrived at the Tongsha waters outside the Wusongkou, the engine propeller suddenly fell off, and the ship could not move. However, due to the lack of radio equipment and the strong wind and waves on the sea, just as it was at a loss, the Ningbo liner Xinjiangtian of China Merchants Bureau happened to pass by the Tongsha waters. At that time, the Chuanshan steamboat had already anchored and waited for rescue. It asked Xinjiangtian to send a radio telegram to Shanghai to report to the company. The original telegram stated briefly that Chuanshan had lost its propeller in the Tongsha waters and was anchored waiting for rescue, and asked the company to send a tugboat to tow it to Shanghai, etc. The company first used the telephone to notify the China Ship Insurance Joint Association and discussed how to tow it. After consultation, it was decided to hire a large tugboat from Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which left Shanghai yesterday to tow the ship and tow it back to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at the port after 12:00 PM last night. After unloading the cargo and passengers, it will be docked for repairs and another propeller will be fitted. When the ship arrives in Shanghai, the Chuanshan Company will submit a request to the Navigation Administration Bureau and the Insurance Joint Association to send technicians to inspect the cause of the accident. The detailed report will be made by the shipowner after arriving in Shanghai. The extent of other damage to the ship is not yet known. It is verified that the Chuanshan steamboat is made of iron, with a gross tonnage of 1,040 tons, a registered tonnage of 6,378 tons, a length of 169 feet, a width of 27 feet 8 inches, a depth of 12 feet, a draft of 9 feet, two decks, a triple-expansion engine, 600 horsepower, a steam pressure of 180, and a speed of 11 knots per hour. It was built in Shanghai in 1920. The hull is insured for peace of mind in the China Maritime Insurance Joint Association.</p>

The meeting adjourned at around 10:00 PM. The original telegram to Yin is recorded as follows: "To Yin Rugeng, former Administrative Inspector of Tongxian County, Hebei Province: As the Administrative Commissioner of eastern Hebei, you have failed to fulfill your duty to defend the country and have used the guise of autonomy to isolate yourself from the country. The people of Zhejiang are deeply indignant. In addition to the resolution by the Standing Committee today to request the Board of Directors to expel you from membership, this is a special warning to you. If you are indeed under duress and the whole thing is not your intention, you should take the opportunity to return south to express your intentions.

<h3>Current Situation of National Goods Industry</h3>
<p>Prices of Many Goods Have Increased, but Enameled Porcelain, etc., Have Not Increased in Price; Volume of National Goods Shipped to Nanyang Area Increases Month by Month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the recent operating conditions of the national goods industry have attracted much attention from various people. A Central News Agency reporter visited Pan Yangyao, who is familiar with the national goods industry, at the Four Banks Joint Treasury, who gave a very detailed account of the industry's situation, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Smaller Factories Cannot Cooperate Since Last Month The national goods industry has seen a slight stagnation in sales due to the soaring prices of raw materials. Because some of the raw materials for national goods are imported, prices have soared, averaging 20%. The price of metals has even risen to one-third of the original price. With the cost of goods high, the purchase price will naturally also rise. At a time when purchasing power is weak, sales are stagnant, and stockpiles accumulate, capital cannot circulate. Selling at low prices again results in capital losses. Therefore, the current situation is somewhat difficult, and the industry cannot cooperate and competes with each other. Recently, national goods factories with extremely small capital have been found on the market, making crude products and selling them cheaply, which has further weakened the sales of goods from various manufacturers. However, larger manufacturers have clearly understood the necessity of cooperation and many are proceeding with cooperation.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Plan to Establish Factories in the Mainland The most difficult aspect of the future of the national goods industry is the planning of foreign merchants to establish factories in the mainland of China. After the Ministry of Finance revised the import and export tariff rates, the import tariff rates for some goods increased significantly. Foreign merchants felt that the promotion of goods in China was affected, so they planned to establish factories in the mainland of China to produce and sell goods, which would be more profitable. This plan is currently underway. If it is realized one day, the production and sales of the national goods industry will inevitably be greatly affected, so the national goods industry is extremely concerned about this.</p>
<p>Promoting National Goods in Various Overseas Regions After the price of raw materials for national goods soared, the prices of many goods increased due to cost factors, but the prices of some goods, such as enameled porcelain, etc., did not increase, so sales have been very strong recently. National goods manufacturers have recently increased their recruitment of personnel for sales and have been promoting sales in the interior, and large quantities of goods have been continuously shipped to even the remote provinces with inconvenient transportation. Overseas regions have also gradually been developed, and the volume of national goods shipped to the Nanyang area has been increasing month by month, which is a good sign.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Donate to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Our country has suffered from frequent disasters over the years. Unfortunately, this year, after entering the summer, it has suffered from floods again. The disaster areas of the Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Han Rivers cover more than ten provinces, and the number of disaster victims exceeds tens of millions. The tragedy is indescribable. The Shanghai Charity Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces has pleaded for the victims in various places and has held various fundraising methods to collect huge sums of money for relief. People from all walks of life are also concerned about the hunger and drowning of the people and have given enthusiastic support, so the fundraising results have been very good. Recently, Li Dachao, Deputy Director of the Fundraising Group of the Association, planned to hold a general donation, which has been underway for many days. Because the method is convenient and the procedures are simple, and the companies and shops acting as donors have all agreed to do their best to appeal for it, donors are happy to help. It is learned that the number of people sending in this donation every day is very large. The following is a record: Zhejiang Industrial Bank 80 yuan, Foreign Tea Association 100 yuan, Grain, Oil, and Cake Exchange 380 yuan, Zhenru Primary School 38 yuan, copper coins 250, Zhongyuan Company 13 yuan 8 jiao, Coal Industry Bank 50 yuan, Lei Yunshang Songfentang 7 yuan 5 jiao, China Industrial Bank 5 yuan 4 jiao, Yuantai Company 10 yuan, China Exchange Bank 29 yuan 7 jiao, Guotai Photo Studio 5 yuan, Li Zongwen 20 yuan, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank 6 yuan, Jishengtang 4 yuan 8 jiao, Minbao Newspaper 8 yuan 2 jiao, Yingfeng Company 1 yuan 7 jiao, Grain, Oil, and Cake Association 37 yuan, Lihua Company 150 yuan, Bank of China 42 yuan 2 jiao, Dayuan Gold Shop 5 yuan, Dalun Silk Shop 10 yuan, Huifeng Company 9 yuan 4 jiao, Fang Jiuxia 46 yuan. In addition, the total mobilization of the Boy Scouts' donation campaign held by the association last time has ended, but the report cards of several groups have not yet been submitted. The previous report stated that more than 30,100 yuan had been received, which was a rough estimate. The exact amount is being settled. The Flood Disaster Association has requested the Boy Scout Council to inform all groups that have not submitted the money to submit it all within the next few days to clear the procedures. The detailed amount of this donation will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Collects Donations for Flood Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper collected donations for flood relief: Mrs. Huang donated 10 yuan, Mr. Zhongyi 1 yuan, and Mr. Wang Chengzhong 2 jiao, for a total of 11 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Suma Returns to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound Agency, Suma, First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China and Consul-General in Beijing, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd. On the morning of the previous day, he met with Arima and Isogu to discuss the situation in the north and the diplomatic situation. Yesterday morning at 11:00, he visited Arima at the Japanese Embassy Office again to continue discussing everything. Then, at 4:00 in the afternoon, he left Shanghai for Beijing by the Shanghai-Ping Railway.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results in the Collection of Aviation Donations by Various Industries; Simple Aviation Exhibition Closes on the 10th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Collection Team Office of the China Aviation Association organized various industries to collect aviation national salvation donations in accordance with the standard of business income. Since the beginning, the results have been excellent. The collection of the aforementioned donations by the brick and tile transportation industry has been enthusiastic since it was handled on June 15. However, because the collection was made by transportation vehicles and there was a lack of organization in the transportation industry, many donations were owed. After collection, they have been successively paid off. However, the procedures are troublesome. In order to facilitate the collection and increase the results, the General Team Office has slightly changed the original method, directly collecting from each brick and tile business. The amended method has been attached to a letter and sent to each brick and tile business in the city for compliance. Yesterday, the Aviation National Salvation Donation Committee of the industry submitted 190 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen. Also, the General Team Office held a simple mobile exhibition of aviation national salvation at the Mass Education Hall on Wenmiao Road. Since its opening on the 10th of last month, the exhibition has been extended due to the extremely crowded attendance. It will officially close on the 10th of this month and will prepare to hold another exhibition at a selected location in western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>More Than 1,000 Overseas Chinese in Siam Detained for Failing to Pay Political Assistance Fee</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Siam are required to pay a political assistance fee of six baht to the resident government every year. This political assistance fee is also known as a poll tax or head tax. After paying, Chinese people must carry the receipt with them, because the police have the right to check it at any time. If they do not have this receipt, they will be punished with hard labor or detention. Last month was the period for collecting political assistance fees for young people. Because the Siamese government has been rejecting Chinese workers and employing Siamese workers in recent years, unemployment is everywhere. Even food and clothing cannot be maintained, so where can there be surplus funds to pay the head tax? Therefore, on the first day after the collection period ended, the Siamese police began to inspect. Within three hours, the number of Chinese who had not paid the political assistance fee reached more than 1,000. After being arrested, they were all detained at the police school. As of the reporter's press time, no accurate information has been received as to how to deal with them.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Unions Send Telegrams of Congratulations to the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee</h3>

<h3>Chargé d'Affaires to Belgium Ling Qihan Returns Home</h3>

<h3>The Flood Relief Association Will Conduct Winter Relief</h3>
<p>Allocate 25,000 Yuan to Relieve Drought in Northern Anhui; Hangzhou Southeast Daily Raises Over 9,000 Yuan for Relief</p>
<p>As the weather has become colder in recent days, the suffering of the disaster victims in various places has become more and more severe. The Shanghai Charity Flood Relief Association is sparing no effort in providing relief. According to Huang Bode, Director of the Association, the Charity Flood Relief Association plans to hold a meeting of directors and supervisors within the next few days to discuss winter relief matters for the disaster victims. Recently, Anhui Province reported that a drought suddenly occurred in northern Anhui this year, and the disaster is extremely serious. The Association sent personnel to investigate and reported the disaster in detail. The Association has now allocated 25,000 yuan from the remaining funds from the previous Drought Relief Association to carry out relief in the area. Also, according to the Association, the Hangzhou Southeast Daily has been actively promoting flood relief this year and has raised a particularly large amount of money. As of today, the newspaper has remitted three batches of relief funds to the Association. The first batch was 3,852 yuan and 6 jiao in national currency, the second batch was 3,053 yuan and 2 jiao in national currency, and the third batch was 2,564 yuan, 2 jiao and 2 fen in national currency, for a total of 9,470 yuan and 2 fen. This shows that they care about the disaster victims and are enthusiastic about relief, just like the Shanghai Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Associations to Hand in Nitre and Sulfur Transportation Permits for Cancellation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the Chemical Raw Materials, Fireworks, Rubber Products, Pickled and Preserved Products, Enamel, Machinery and Dyeing, and Medicinal Materials Associations, as well as the China Chemical Industry Society, the Great China Match Company, and other stores and members, stating that on the 4th of this month, they received a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Nitre and Sulfur General Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Su Zi No. 429, stating that "In the case of the Ministry of Finance's order Jian Zi No. 19549 issued on October 19 of this year, it was found that the deadline for submitting nitre and sulfur forms for cancellation has been stated by oneself. Once used, they should be submitted for cancellation immediately to prevent abuses and comply with regulations. Now, for the convenience of checking, the bureau will register the cancellation deadline for each of the above-mentioned forms issued in the future, whether the applicant is a public institution, a company or factory, or a contractor, and check them at any time. If any have exceeded the cancellation deadline and have not yet been submitted, they will be urged to submit them quickly and must not be negligent. At the end of each month, the submitted forms will be verified and forwarded to the ministry for separate storage and verification for cancellation. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered to comply," and so on. In view of this, it was found that most of the above-mentioned forms requested by various parties have a deadline for cancellation, but many have not been submitted after the deadline. In view of the foregoing, in addition to sending letters to urge submission, we also send letters to your association for reference, and hope that you will instruct the merchants who have obtained the permits to send them to the bureau as soon as they expire or are used, so that they can be compiled and submitted to the ministry for verification and cancellation. In the future, we hope that you will follow the case. In view of this, we send a letter for notification, and hope that you will refer to it.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Land Bureau Implements the Method of Photographing and Filing Single Deeds</h3>
<p>In order to allow people to retrieve their single deeds for safekeeping after exchanging certificates, the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau previously drafted a method of photographing and filing deeds, which was published in the newspapers on November 24. It is now learned that the method has been approved by the Municipal Government and will be implemented from the 2nd of this month. Anyone who submits a single deed or other important evidence for verification when exchanging a Gui Di practice certificate, which is not related to the retention of the Land Bureau, may apply for photography at the Receiving and Dispatching Office. The Fourth Section of the Land Bureau will verify, stamp, and number the single deed, and after waiting for the photograph, the item can be taken and submitted. After the Fourth Section compares it with the original single deed and confirms that there are no errors, it will be returned. The procedure is very convenient, and the photography price is also very low. It is heard that after the implementation of this method, all owners can retrieve their single deeds for dealing with other disputes during the certificate exchange period, which is very convenient.</p>

<h3>The Tianquan Pavilion Art Exhibition is Extended for Three Days</h3>
<p>The Tianquan Pavilion Exhibition, which has been held at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road, has been open for seven days, and has been praised by all sectors. Visitors and purchases have been enthusiastic. The grandeur of the exhibition has been widely reported in the newspapers. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close on the 5th, but due to the requests of enthusiasts to extend the exhibition, it has been extended for three days. In addition, rare items such as calligraphy, painting, silk embroidery, carving, and stationery have been added. Among them, there are Song and Ming dynasty kesi, which are rarely seen by people in Shanghai, and are comparable to those transported from the Forbidden City to London for display. They are vivid, fragrant, ancient, beautiful, and simple, and the prices are low, which is especially convenient for collectors of antiquities. It is estimated that the exhibition will close on the 8th, which happens to be a Sunday, so it will be even more crowded. Those who are interested should go to see it as soon as possible to feast their eyes.</p>
<h3>The Weather in This Port Turns Clear; Heavy Fog Yesterday Morning; Ships and Airplanes Were Delayed</h3>
<p>After the snowfall in this port the day before yesterday, there were intermittent rain showers in the evening. Yesterday, it was late in clearing up. Although the weather had turned clear and cold, the fog was extremely heavy, especially between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. The visibility was unclear beyond a few steps. The vehicles on the streets had to reduce their speed and move slowly. The shops also opened and burned electric lights for business. The heavy fog gradually dissipated after 9:00 a.m., and the sunlight immediately emerged from the clouds, and the sky was clear. When the fog occurred, traffic was greatly hindered. Various river and sea ships were stopped by the fog outside the Wusongkou, and many ships, including the Fusheng, were delayed until after 10:00 a.m. before they entered the port one after another. The China Aviation Company's Shanghai-Hankou-West aircraft was also delayed from 7:00 a.m. to 8:35 a.m. The Shanghai-Ping Beijing-bound aircraft was also delayed.</p>
<h3>Land Owners in the City Center Request Cancellation of Fallow Land Donation; Economic Downturn Prevents Merchants from Investing</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, in order to complete the Greater Shanghai Plan, the Shanghai Municipal Government has divided the land in the city center into phases for recruitment, limiting the time for building city houses. The Construction Committee of the Municipal Government has also built sports fields, municipal libraries, swimming pools, and dormitories, cooperatives, etc. for the staff of the Municipal Government's various branch bureaus in the city center as an example of promotion. Banks in the city have also built new villages there, which have been completed one after another. The Municipal Government, in view of the fact that some of the land obtained by the owners has not yet been reported for construction, which has hindered the completion of Greater Shanghai, has approved a time limit for construction to make the plan to prosper Greater Shanghai a reality as soon as possible. Otherwise, a fallow land donation will be collected. The Land Owners Association in the City Center believes that this kind of donation method is not found in the major cities of our country. Moreover, during this extremely depressed period, merchants are unable to invest, which is also reasonable. Moreover, due to economic panic, the special zone owners have many empty lots and cannot build. The special zone authorities do not have any regulations limiting construction. If this precedent is set, what are the consequences? Therefore, at 4:00 p.m. the other day, the association convened an emergency meeting of all land owners at the association's office on Beijing Road to discuss countermeasures. Dozens of people, including Li Bohan and Xi Yanfang, attended. Everyone believed that this kind of donation method for fallow land was not found in the major cities of the country, and Shanghai should not set this precedent. This kind of donation tax is difficult for the association to recognize. A resolution was passed on the spot to jointly petition the Municipal Government authorities to sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants and cancel it. If the city's economy turns around, they will invest and build according to the construction procedures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Police Station Intercepts a Large Batch of Silver</h3>
<p>Totaling 22,455 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (5th), when the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru was about to depart, Police Chief Fukuyama of the Japanese Consulate Police Station, led Patrol Chief Matsuo and Detective Higuchi, etc., to inspect the secret transportation of silver at the Huishan Pier, but unexpectedly intercepted 21 secret transporters, with silver amounting to 22,455 yuan. In addition to being found in luggage, many of the guests who were seeing them off also secretly carried it on their bodies, and it was searched out one by one. According to the North China Daily News, when a certain Japanese ship arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, it carried more than 500 Japanese passengers in third class. The ship had changed its usual route in order to transport this type of passenger to Nagasaki, so it arrived a day later than scheduled. After arriving in Shanghai, most of these passengers were engaged in the trafficking of silver dollars. Although the Shanghai Japanese Consulate Police, in cooperation with the Chinese Customs, strictly prohibit the private export of silver, this news has apparently not yet spread to the villages around Nagasaki. Many Japanese who deliberately try to buy silver privately in Shanghai come from that area. Of the 500 people who arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, it is likely that more than half will return disappointed. According to shipping company sources, the number of third-class passengers traveling between Shanghai and Nagasaki in the middle of last month was three times higher than usual. A certain company, which averages one ship arriving in Shanghai every four days, told the North China Daily News yesterday that each time it carries between 150 and 200 Japanese passengers who appear to be small traders, and the third-class seats are fully booked when departing from Shanghai to Nagasaki. It is not known why these people are so busy.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Accuses Dentist of Enticement and Abandonment</h3>
<p>Dentist Submits Statement of Separation, Claims Ignorance of Lawsuit</p>
<p>Jin Jiuru, a dentist residing at number 223 Hubei Road, has recently been sued by a young woman named Sun Suying at the First Special District Court, accusing him of enticement, abandonment, and offenses against public morals. She also filed a civil suit seeking 6,000 yuan in alimony. Sun Suying's husband, Jiang Heshang, works on the Coolidge President ocean liner and is away from home for years at a time. In June of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], Sun Suying was introduced to Jin Jiuru's dental clinic to get dentures. After several visits, they became acquainted. During their conversations, Jin learned that Sun's husband worked on an ocean liner and was not often home. He seized the opportunity to entice her, claiming that his business was empty and lacked someone to manage it. He urged Sun to divorce her husband and promised to marry her. At the time, Sun Suying was feeling lonely and neglected due to her husband's long absences. Furthermore, she saw Jin Jiuru as sincere, steady, and successful in business, and thought that he would be a reliable partner for life. Consequently, she began a relationship with Jin and cohabited in his dental clinic's upstairs quarters. In June of the previous year, she officially divorced her husband, Jiang Heshang. Later, when Sun Suying became pregnant, she went to her mother's home in Suzhou to await childbirth. On June 19th of the previous year, she gave birth to a son, named Yaxian. Afterwards, the defendant, Jin Jiuru, became increasingly distant and his financial support became sporadic. Her letters and money requests went unanswered. Sun Suying then brought her child to Shanghai to negotiate with him. Initially, he was evasive, providing a monthly living allowance of 30 yuan. However, he later abandoned her altogether. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit according to the law. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Sun Suying, did not appear. Only the defendant, Jin Jiuru, surrendered himself and submitted a statement of separation, claiming that he had indeed cohabited with Sun Suying last year, but they had never rented a house together. They met at hotels. Only after Sun gave birth did he learn that she had another man. On November 16th of this year, they negotiated a settlement, agreeing to separate. He paid 110 yuan to his friend, Mr. Ren, to be given to Ms. Sun's representative, Mr. Xiao. He claimed he did not know why she suddenly filed a lawsuit. Judge Liu verified the statement and adjourned the case for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Real Estate Tax Assessment - Municipal Council Issues Official Statement</h3>
<p>Original Tax Policy Unchanged - Separate Valuation for Tax Limited to Special Circumstances - Responding to Principles Proposed by Chinese Taxpayers - No Dispute over the Legal Status of the Property Valuation Committee</p>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association published an article on October 30th regarding the Municipal Council's rental assessment and tax collection methods, which was widely reported in the local newspapers. The main point of the article was that the Municipal Council had abandoned its established practice of levying property taxes based on the rental amounts listed on property deeds and had instead adopted a method of assessing taxes based on estimated property values. The Municipal Council authorities took this matter very seriously and issued an important statement, earnestly declaring to taxpayers that the Municipal Council's original property tax policy had not been changed or amended. The basis for assessing taxes based on estimated values is the same today as it was 65 years ago. In order to ensure a balanced tax burden, the Municipal Council has the right to estimate rental values. The initial basis for this right is the Land Regulations of 1854. Furthermore, estimated values are applied to both self-owned and rented properties, without any doubt. The Municipal Council operates on the principle that while rental amounts can serve as documentary evidence of a property's taxable value, they are sometimes insufficient. Since 1867, various courts have repeatedly reviewed this point and confirmed its validity, stating in their judgments, "After careful review of the arguments presented by both sides, we are firmly convinced that the Municipal Council has the right to estimate rental values separately from the actual rent for the purpose of levying taxes." Of course, the most appropriate and widely applicable basis for distributing taxes in a given area is the rented property. Therefore, the type of property is examined and flexible standards are established so that the amount of tax can automatically adjust according to the property's value, in order to achieve balance. The soundness of this approach is universally recognized and needs no further elaboration. However, since the goal of taxation in a given area is to balance the burden on the general public, the rental price of a property must be fairly compared to other properties. Can a single property deed be considered a perfectly fair and unbiased standard? Therefore, the Municipal Council of the Public Concession uses the annual rental value of each property as the standard for assessing municipal general rates. For these properties, the property owner has no other obligations besides external repairs, and the documentary value of the property deed is considered by the Municipal Council to adequately represent the rental value, and is used as the standard for levying general rates in the vast majority of cases. However, as mentioned above, when the property deed is insufficient, the Municipal Council must estimate the rental value in order to balance the burden on the public, using the same type of property in the same area as the standard to calculate the appropriate tax. However, this type of event only accounts for a tiny minority of all properties in the Concession, which is the point of contention for the Chinese Taxpayers Association. The following is a list of cases where the property deed is insufficient:</p>
<p>(1) When the rent is reduced due to business connections or familial ties between the property owner and the tenant.</p>
<p>(2) When the tenant originally rented the property at a fair price, but later made permanent improvements and additions, significantly increasing the property's rental value.</p>
<p>(3) When the tenant does not pay the full rent, but instead provides partial compensation in the form of cash. In this case, the actual rent should be calculated by adding the face value of the rent to the total annual cash compensation.</p>
<p>(4) When, apart from economic reasons, the property owner waives a portion of the rent because the tenant is an employee of the property owner or indirectly provides services to the property owner.</p>
<p>(5) When the property owner and the tenant collude to forge property deeds in order to evade general rates.</p>
<p>From these various cases, it can be seen that the Municipal Council has no choice but to use a comparative method as the basis for taxation when the property deed amount differs significantly from the property's value. This method is also essential for protecting the interests of the majority of taxpayers, as the general public has already paid the full amount of taxes on the actual rental value of their properties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the Chinese Taxpayers Association stated in its opinion, "The Municipal Council is using outdated provisions of the Land Regulations to effectively increase tax revenue," and, "For example, if the rent is 100 yuan and the tax rate is 14%, the monthly tax should be 14 yuan. If the value is overestimated to 150 yuan, the total tax will be 21 yuan. This does not increase the tax rate, but the total tax increases by one and a half times, equivalent to increasing the tax rate from 14% to 21%." The Municipal Council must correct this point: if someone presents a property deed showing a monthly rent of 100 yuan, but the property's actual rental value is known to be 150 yuan per month, and the Municipal Council allows them to pay tax based on 100 yuan, then the tax rate they pay will be less than 14%, only 9.33%. The unpaid tax will inevitably be distributed among other taxpayers who pay according to the regulations, which is unfair in both law and reason.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the Chinese Taxpayers Association's statement that the Municipal Council has abandoned its practice of using the rental amount listed on the property deed as the basis for tax collection and has instead adopted a method of assessing taxes based on estimated values is a misunderstanding. The Municipal Council has not abandoned or changed its tax principles or established practices. In recent years, the Municipal Council has only been more precise in auditing and investigating the rents declared by tenants, making it difficult for a small number of scheming individuals in society to achieve their selfish desires.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the method of collecting property taxes in the Shanghai Municipal Government's administrative area outside the Public Concession is the same as the above. Article 10 of the Shanghai Municipal Property Tax Collection Regulations states: "The determination of the rental value shall be based on the property deed or rental agreement for the most recent two months. If there is a significant discrepancy between the property and the rental value, the rental value shall be separately assessed for the purpose of collecting property taxes. For self-owned properties occupied by the owner, the Finance Bureau shall send personnel to assess the value. If there is a dispute over the assessed rental value, the Property Valuation Committee shall evaluate it." (See the Shanghai Municipal Government Gazette of October 10, 1934). The aforementioned Valuation Committee is composed of six officials from various bureaus of the Municipal Government and three members of a Municipal Government committee. Here are simple answers to the three principles proposed in the Chinese Taxpayers Association's opinion:</p>
<p>Principle 1: "The Municipal Council should levy taxes based on the actual rent for properties with actual rents. For properties owned and occupied by the owner, taxes may be levied based on the estimated rent." If this principle is applied, it may hinder the balance of taxation and contradict court decisions.</p>
<p>Principle 2: "The Municipal Council's establishment of the so-called Property Valuation Committee has no legal basis. Its judgments have no binding force on the outside world." The right to assess taxes based on estimated values belongs to the Municipal Council, but the Council is not a technical body and must hire specialists as consultants. Therefore, the Council does not dispute the legal status of the committee.</p>
<p>Principle 3: "The Municipal Council may not arbitrarily increase taxes. Unless taxpayers agree to change the tax rate, taxpayers have the absolute right to refuse to pay taxes increased by the Municipal Council outside the law." While the right to set the tax rate rests with the taxpayers, the Municipal Council's duty is to strive for a balanced distribution of taxes. The result of this method is to reduce the average burden on taxpayers, not to increase it.</p>

<h3>Another Cruel Woman Beats Three-Year-Old Child to Death - Body Covered in Scratches - Died from Injuries After Hospitalization</h3>
<p>Recently, a woman in this city, Jiang Wang, was prosecuted by the police for cruel treatment, but the court has not yet rendered a verdict. The victim was her own child. Here is a detailed account of the incident: Wang Awei, a native of Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, makes a living selling soy sauce chicken and duck. His wife, Cao, is 39 years old and lives with him at number 7, Lane 423, Weihaiwei Road. Ms. Cao had a son and a daughter. The daughter is still an infant, while the son had already passed away. For the sake of having a male heir, on the fourth day of the ninth lunar month of this year, Ms. Cao adopted a</p>
<p>three-year-old boy named Laifa from her hometown. However, because he was not her own son, she treated him differently and often abused him. The sounds of whipping and flogging could be heard outside. Jin Guangyu, a native of Changzhou who manages the rental accounts for the lane and lives at number 4, Lane 423, often heard the child's cries of agony and felt sorry for him. He often thought about how to save him, but had no opportunity. On the afternoon before yesterday, Jin heard Laifa being beaten again and felt compassion. He rushed to the Chengdu Road police station to report the incident. The head of the station ordered a detective to go to the scene and arrest Wang Cao. Laifa was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. After examination by a doctor, it was discovered that the child's</p>
<p>body was covered in scratches and nail marks. The injuries were extremely serious. He was hospitalized for treatment. However, at 3:40 AM yesterday, he died in the hospital due to his severe injuries. Yesterday, another similar case occurred, the difference being that it was his own three-year-old daughter, Rongdi, who was beaten to death. Laifa died in the hospital because he could not be saved due to the severity of his injuries. The police sent his body to the morgue for examination. At 9 AM yesterday, Wang Cao was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted Wang Cao under Article 286, Section 1 of the Criminal Code. Wang Cao denied the abuse, claiming that Laifa suffered from severe seizures, so she used chicken eggs to rub</p>
<p>all over his body to relieve the seizures. She claimed that the nail marks were caused by this. She requested an evaluation and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. Police lawyer Zhang argued that Laifa's cause of death, whether it was due to beatings or illness, could only be determined after an examination by the prosecutor. Therefore, he requested that the hearing be postponed. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the report and ordered Wang Cao to be remanded in custody for another hearing. Subsequently, Guo Wei, the prosecutor of the First Special District Court,</p>
<p>along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. They took statements from witnesses such as Jin Guangyu. The forensic examination concluded that the deceased child, Wang Laifa, had indeed died from injuries sustained from beatings before his death. Wang Cao was suspected of committing a crime. The police filed a lawsuit with the court for further investigation. The body was handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for burial.</p>
<h3>Fashion Workers' Strike - Party Headquarters Mediates for Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>The fashion garment workers in this city set a fixed price system in the previous year, which was filed with the party and government agencies. However, recently, fashion companies such as Dahua and Xinda on Fuzhou Road have used the excuse of a poor market to discount the stipulated wages. The workers rely on the income from these few months of work in late autumn and early winter to maintain their livelihood for the year. Therefore, the night before last, more than 500 workers across the city automatically went on strike, demanding that the employers restore the original wages. The garment workers' union sent Yang Shishan, Weng Liangsheng, Zhou Weixin, Gao De, and others to the city party headquarters yesterday morning to petition. They were received by Lu Jingshi and Zhou Funong, who promised to find a way to mediate. They then went to the General Labor Union of the Social Affairs Bureau to make the same request. In the afternoon, the city party headquarters sent Wu Wenbang from the civil training section to convene a mediation meeting with labor representatives Yang Baoshan and Zhang Liancai, and employer representative Lin Zhengrong. After strong persuasion from the party representative, they agreed to resume work first to prevent the labor unrest from escalating, and to wait for formal mediation at the city party headquarters today. The union representatives then notified the members to resume work temporarily and await the authorities' decision. Therefore, most of the workers have resumed work and the labor unrest has temporarily come to an end.</p>
<h3>Fifth Group Wedding - One Couple Holds Supplementary Ceremony - Car Pickup Delayed, Missed Participation</h3>
<p>In the fifth group wedding held the other day, a total of 113 couples originally registered to participate. Couple number 24 (male, Jin Guanlin; female, Cao Guifen) did not participate due to the groom's absence. It has been learned that this was due to a misunderstanding. The groom's family sent a car to pick up the bride, but the car did not go to the bride's house to go to the wedding hall, but to the bride's house to pick her up. After several trips back and forth, they missed the wedding time. They held their wedding ceremony at the Quanfucai Restaurant in Ximen that evening.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Dongjiadu Street the Other Day</h3>
<p>Zhang Yanzhang's house, located at number 148 Dongjiadu Street, Nanshi, also houses a clinic run by doctor Yang Yongxuan. On the afternoon the other day, around 4 PM, four robbers suddenly broke into Zhang's house. They used the pretext of visiting Dr. Yang and pulled out handguns, threatening everyone to be silent. They drove everyone into a corner and told them not to move. The robbers then entered Zhang's inner room, ransacked the cabinets, and searched at will. They stole more than 200 yuan in cash and foreign currency, as well as clothes and ornaments. The robbers left with their loot. It is said that the total loss is worth more than 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Guo Yinxiang's House Robbed</h3>
<p>At 2:30 AM last night, five robbers, all speaking with a local accent, suddenly came to Guo Yinxiang's house at number 1 Robiegen Road, Huxi. They entered the bedroom after prying open a wooden window in the back door. They first tied up Guo Yinxiang and his wife, and then brandished sharp knives, threatening them to be silent. They stole 97 yuan in cash and foreign currency, one gold ring (weighing two and a half mace), one gold bracelet, one silver necklace, and one leather coat. The robbery lasted for about an hour. The robbers then escaped through the back door. Afterwards, the victim filed a loss report and requested that Tan Baoshou, the director of the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, transfer the case to the detective team for a thorough investigation to apprehend the criminals.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Silver Currency Case from Warship Kitchen - Investigation Concluded</h3>
<p>Tan Shilou, a Guangdong native who works in the kitchen of a foreign warship, was found to be carrying 1,400 yuan in silver currency by Chang Gurenmin of the Customs anti-smuggling team on October 7th of this year. The silver currency was confiscated by the Customs, and the police were notified to arrest Tan and send him to the District Court Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu investigated and determined that he was guilty of harming the national currency and filed a public prosecution. Judge Wu Deying held a preliminary hearing but did not conclude the case. The details were reported previously. It has now been learned that Judge Wu held a further hearing at 11 AM yesterday, ordering that the detained Tan Shiquan, 26 years old, be brought to court for questioning. The judge asked, "Where did this silver currency come from?" He replied, "The warship arrived in Shanghai from Weihaiwei to pay wages, and the sailors returned the money they owed me." The judge asked, "Did you intend to transport this silver currency abroad?" He replied, "I had no such intention." The judge asked, "Where is the warship planning to go?" He replied, "Hong Kong." The judge asked, "Why didn't you exchange it for legal tender at the bank?" He replied, "I intended to use the money to pay the Guangshun Provisions Store for the goods I owed them." Witness Zhao Nian, 31 years old, a Guangdong native, who works as an accountant at the Guangshun Store, testified that Tan Shiquan owed the store more than 1,000 yuan for goods and had agreed to repay it this time. He did not know anything else. At this point, the judge determined that the case was clear and asked Prosecutor Ouyang to present his opinion. Finally, lawyer Ge Zhaoji, hired by the defendant, rose to defend him for a long time. The judge then concluded the case and set a date for sentencing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Entanglement over the Death of a Maidservant and Her Delivery to the Fuyuantang Funeral Parlor</h3>
<p>Meng Zhiren, a 32-year-old Yunnan native, formerly served in the military and is currently living in Shanghai with his family at the home of his relative Xu Xinqin (30-year-old Hangzhou native) at number 79 Huayuan Lane, Avenue du Père Robert, French Concession. Three years ago, Meng purchased a maidservant named Ailian in Yunnan. She was 12 years old this year and was brought to Shanghai to serve him. Recently, she suddenly contracted typhoid fever and, despite four days of medical treatment, died yesterday morning. Meng wrapped the body in a cotton quilt and bound it with hemp rope. He ordered Li Youqing (25-year-old Henan native), a servant of his neighbor Xu Zhaocheng (a Chinese medicine doctor) at number 77 in the same lane, to hire a rickshaw to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch funeral parlor at number 8 Ningbo Road (intersection of Minquan Road) morgue. They knocked on the door and requested that the parlor accept the body. The parlor refused, stating that it was inconvenient to accept the body without reporting to the police. Meng and Li then placed the body wrapped on the ground, attracting a crowd of onlookers. At 7:30 AM, Chinese police officer number 241 from the McTyeire Road police station found them. Suspecting that they were trying to abandon the body, he brought them to the police station. After investigation, he sent the body to the morgue. At noon that day, Inspector Wang Ren of the Second Special District Court, along with forensic doctors and a clerk, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. They took the statements of the arresting officer and police officer number 241, who testified about the arrest. Meng Zhiren testified that the deceased was originally a maidservant, but the road pass stated she was his niece. Recently, she became ill and, despite medical treatment, died on the way to the hospital this morning. Therefore, he sent the body to the morgue. Because he was new to Shanghai, he was unaware of the Concession regulations and did not report to the police. He had a prescription that could prove her medical treatment. Li Youqing and Xu Xinqin also testified, corroborating Meng's statement. Inspector Wang then ruled that Meng Ailian had indeed died of illness. The body was released to Meng Zhiren for burial. The prescription was attached to the case file. After the examination, Meng purchased a coffin and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch funeral parlor cemetery for temporary storage. However, out of caution, the police summoned Meng and others to the police station again in the afternoon for a detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Widow's Abortion Death Case Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Midwife's Testimony Deceitful</p>
<p>Wang Lu, a 37-year-old local widow of Wang Guan, who lived at number 1, Lane 61, Avenue Joffre, had been widowed for more than ten years. About a year ago, she became involved with Wang Xinggen, a distant uncle and track repairman number 34 at the French Tram Company. They secretly started a relationship, and she became pregnant after four months. Fearing that she would be discovered and that it would be detrimental to her, she told her family that her younger sister-in-law was giving birth and needed someone to take care of her. She left home for 20 days, and on the 27th of last month, with the consent of her lover, she purchased an abortifacient from a midwife in the French town of Fahua in Huxi, which caused internal injuries. Despite medical treatment, she died on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month at the home of her lover, Wang Xinggen, at number 4, Baoan Lane, Xinqiao Street. The second landlord, Li Changgen, informed the family of the deceased. Wang Guan reported to the French police, who sent the body to the morgue. A report was made to the Second Special District Court, and officials were sent to examine the body and allow the family to collect it. Detective Tao Ronglin and others from the police station, accompanied by Wang Xinggen, went to Fahua Town and found the midwife, Sun Shen, 40 years old, a local resident living at number 830 in the town. They arrested Sun Shen and conducted an investigation. This was reported yesterday. Yesterday, the police escorted Sun Shen to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Court President Wang Gangxu heard the case. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the Police Department presented the case and charged her with abortion under Article 289, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Detective Tao Ronglin reported that the police received a report from Wang Guan that his widowed sister-in-law, Wang Lu, had an affair with her uncle, Wang Xinggen, and died from an abortion. Therefore, the defendant Sun Shen was arrested. The plaintiff, Wang Guan, stated that his widowed sister-in-law, Wang Lu, usually stayed at home and sometimes went to Ningbo for a day or two before returning. He did not know that she had any improper affairs. This time, she said that his sister-in-law was giving birth and took clothes to go home. She stayed for nearly 20 days. The other day, someone came to report her death. He went to inquire and learned that she had had an abortion, which led to her death. He asked for justice. The defendant, Sun Shen, denied giving her an abortifacient. The deceased's mother, Lu He (62 years old), testified that her daughter came home and stayed for 20 days. The other day, she went home and did not know that she had had an abortion. The court then questioned Wang Xinggen and the second landlord, Li Changgen, about the circumstances of the deceased's affair, abortion, illness, and death. The hearing was adjourned to the 14th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Sudden Cold Snap Freezes Poor People to Death</h3>
<p>Died After Falling From Building While Scavenging, Separate Reports Filed to Court for Examination</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a poor man froze to death at the Doukou of Chao Hui Villa, behind the South City Train Station. At 78 Yuqing Lane, North Sichuan Road, a scavenger fell to his death from a building. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Freezing to Death of a Poor Man</p>
<p>Recently, the weather in this city suddenly turned cold. Those who have no warm clothes are at risk of freezing to death. Yesterday, around 11 a.m., a man about 50 years old froze to death in front of Chao Hui Villa, behind the South Train Station, because he was wearing only tattered single-layer clothes and could not withstand the cold. The police officer No. 36 of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered this and reported it to Director Yao. Director Yao immediately sent an inspector to investigate and reported it to the General Bureau for record. At the same time, the local head was instructed to report to the local court for an examination of the body. It was found that the deceased had no family members, and the Shan Tang provided a coffin.</p>
<p>Death From Scavenging Fall</p>
<p>The residents of 78 Yuqing Lane, North Sichuan Road, moved elsewhere yesterday. Later, a scavenger from Jiangbei, about 40 years old, carrying a bamboo basket, took the opportunity to enter the building to scavenge. Unexpectedly, the man fell from a window on the upper floor, injuring his head. He was barely breathing. Sun Zhaofeng, a police officer No. 18 from the North Sichuan Road Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, found him and immediately sent the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries and excessive blood loss, he died around 9 a.m. yesterday. Inspector Liu reported to the Bureau for record and also reported to the authorities.</p>
<h3>Wang Changlin Sued by Adoptive Mother, Trial Concluded</h3>
<p>Adoptive Mother Brings Ancestral Tablet to Court to Prove Changlin is Indeed Adopted Son</p>
<p>—Debate Concluded Yesterday, Date Set for Pronouncement—</p>
<p>Wang Changlin, currently an assistant manager at a certain bank, was adopted at the age of fourteen by his widowed aunt, Mrs. Wang Shi, because her husband died without offspring. Mrs. Wang Shi possessed a large inheritance and devoted herself to nurturing Changlin, hoping to bring honor to the family. She provided him with a thorough education. After graduating from Tsinghua University in Beiping, she continued to provide funds for him to study in America. She also provided financial assistance to Changlin's biological mother from time to time, sparing no expense even if it meant depleting her own wealth. Unexpectedly, Changlin's biological parents suddenly published a notice when their son was about to return home, declaring the cancellation of the adoption agreement. When Changlin returned to Shanghai, he was not allowed to meet with his adoptive mother. By this time, Mrs. Wang Shi had become a poor old woman. Seeing Changlin return home in glory, working in the financial sector and earning hundreds of dollars a month, she thought that even animals know how to repay their parents. She negotiated with him, asking for support. Changlin could not shirk his responsibility and initially agreed to pay 40 dollars a month, but each payment was delayed in various ways, causing Mrs. Wang Shi extreme hardship in recent times. Unable to endure it any longer, she hired lawyer Wang Liwu to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against Wang Changlin to confirm their mother-son relationship, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 100 dollars per month for living expenses and to repay the 5,000 dollars previously advanced for tuition. A summons had already been issued, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Yuhai opened the court and continued the trial. Both parties and witnesses appeared in court as summoned. The plaintiff, Mrs. Wang Shi, was already in her sixties, with white hair. To prove the fact of Changlin's adoption, she brought to the court her late husband's ancestral tablet made in 1918. The tablet bore the words "Also Adopted Son Wang Changlin." The old woman's eyes were blurred, and she shed tears as she gazed at the tablet. First, witness Mrs. Xi Shi testified that Wang Changlin's monthly payment of 40 dollars to the plaintiff was initially delivered through her third sister. After her third sister died, Changlin occasionally sent it to her house through someone else. Next, the plaintiff, Mrs. Wang Shi, stated that the defendant returned to the country in 1926 and handed over all the family property to him for management in 1929, which was all squandered. Now the defendant lives in a foreign-style house and rides in a car, while I live in a rented small room and struggle to make ends meet, pawning items to survive. She then presented a large bundle of pawn tickets, estimated to be worth over a thousand dollars. The defendant, Wang Changlin, testified that he was an assistant manager at a certain bank, earning a monthly salary of over 320 dollars, and claimed that the plaintiff's family property was squandered by the plaintiff herself. The court stated that the defendant, as a junior member of the family, should not disregard the livelihood of his elders and engage in litigation. After reprimanding the defendant, the lawyers for both sides debated each other to a conclusion, then were ordered to withdraw and await the verdict.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>Compiled by China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(No. 4 of General Survey of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>6.  Sales Situation</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest cotton cloth market in our country. The sales of cotton cloth extend to all parts of the country and the Nanyang region. Those engaged in this industry are divided into two types: Zihao (firms) and Menzhuang (shops). Zihao mainly engage in wholesale, while Menzhuang mainly engage in retail. Some operate independently, while others operate jointly. During the heyday of this industry (1929 to 1931), there were about a thousand large and small shops. The total annual turnover reached about 100 million yuan or more. After 1932, the Northeast became a purely Japanese goods market. In the provinces of North China, due to the strong presence of Japanese goods in Qingdao, Tianjin, and other ports, only sporadic sales were made. South China, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, had better sales, but Japanese goods were also quite active. In Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, after the chaos of bandits, the economy was depressed, and transactions were minimal in the early stages, but have gradually turned around recently. In Hunan and Henan provinces, due to the proliferation of small-scale weaving factories, most areas are self-sufficient. The market conditions in Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are sluggish and no longer what they used to be. In the Nanyang region, due to sluggish sales of local products, the amount of goods purchased has sharply decreased. Statistics show that the total sales volume for the whole year is about 50 million yuan (from July 1934 to June 1935), which is only about seven-tenths of the previous year. Transactions on the Inner Bund Street account for about 20 percent, or about 10 million yuan. Sales in South China provinces account for 50 percent, or about 25 million yuan. Sales in North China account for 20 percent, or about 15 million yuan. If we consider the regional location of the shops in this city, the business of those opened in the British and French concessions must be reduced by about 30 percent. Those opened in Hongkou and Nanshi must be reduced by about [blank], and those opened in Zhabei, Pudong, and other places must be reduced by about [blank] of 50.</p>
<p>7.  Comparison of Market Prices</p>
<p>Last year, a huge outflow of silver from our country caused a financial panic, and credit became extremely tight. The market was sluggish, so the consumption of cotton cloth decreased sharply compared to the previous year, and market prices trended downwards. Sales were quite slow in the spring and summer seasons. After autumn, transactions gradually became more active, with the Tianjin group purchasing the most. The groups along the two railway lines came in second. Market prices rebounded slightly. However, due to the low purchasing power in the interior, sales soon became sluggish again. Market prices were never able to remain firm. In the first three months of this year, cloth sales remained sluggish, and market prices showed no signs of rebounding. After April, there was a slight turnaround. Wholesale sales to both local and out-of-town merchants were extremely active, especially those to the Ningbo group and along the Yangtze River. Sales were excellent. Market prices were firm. As the end of April approached, credit became tighter, and out-of-town merchants hesitated to move forward. Except for the smooth transactions in Sichuan and Guangdong, the rest were only sporadic additions, with very small quantities. Between May and June, as the summer season arrived, the goods that should have been on the market were already sufficiently stocked in various places, and transactions were quiet. Only the Sichuan and Guangdong groups had slightly stronger transactions. Transactions gradually picked up in July. Sales were good in the local area, Tianjin, Guangdong, and various ports along the Yangtze River. Market prices were stable. Between August and September, various groups added winter goods, and sales were very strong. The coastal merchants along the Yangtze River purchased even more, and business in the local area was also active. Furthermore, as gold prices trended higher and costs increased, the prices of all cotton cloths rose in unison. Some rose by one or two cents, while others rose by several jiao. From October to the present, because gold prices have become increasingly firm, foreign exchange rates have shrunk, and raw materials have become gradually more expensive, cloth prices have also risen with the tide. Furthermore, because the currency is about to be devalued, shops with more financial resources are all hoarding as much as possible, so transactions are extremely busy. However, this type of transaction is purely due to stimulation by monetary policy. If the general purchasing power cannot be increased, the prospects for cotton cloth are still not optimistic. The following table compares the market prices of various major cotton cloths over the past two years.</p>
<p>Shanghai Main Cotton Cloth Market Price Table</p>
<p>Category  Trademark Name  Factory Name  1933 Average  1934 Average  September 1935  October 1935  November 1935</p>
<p>13-Pound Coarse Cloth  Siping Lotus  Shenxin  Highest 6.625  Lowest 6.300  6.250  5.925  6.250  6.725</p>

<p>16-Pound Coarse Twill  Double Fish Jiqing  Qingfeng  Highest 8.800  Lowest 7.500</p>
<p>8.  Current Status of the Industry</p>
<p>The cotton cloth industry is extremely important in the Shanghai market. During the heyday of the industry, there were about a thousand large and small businesses in the city. The total annual turnover reached about 100 million yuan or more. In recent years, due to frequent troubles and the people's livelihood being depressed, business has declined year by year. According to statistics released by the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, the total turnover in the past year has decreased to 50 million yuan, only half of that during the heyday. The details are in the following table. (Unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>Business Type  Number of Businesses  Capital  Annual Turnover</p>
<p>Wholesale  210  2,300  23,000</p>
<p>Retail  250  3,000  17,000</p>
<p>Wholesale and Retail  40  850  10,000</p>
<p>Total  500  6,150  50,000</p>
<p>We hereby correct the misprints in Section 5, "Procurement Situation," of the "General Situation of Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry" compiled by our office. In the "Domestic Goods" section, the second line, "On average, about 10,000 pieces of white goods per 'day'" should read "On average, about 10,000 pieces of white goods per 'month.'" Furthermore, in the "Japanese Goods" section, the second-to-last line, "The daily output is about 20,000 pieces," should read "The 'monthly' output is about 20,000 pieces." We hope this will be corrected tomorrow! Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Yisheng Store Tax Evasion Case, Request to Provide Guarantee and Return Silk, Most of it Certainly Tax Evasion, Customs Obtains Evidence, Request to Provide Guarantee, Court Has Not Yet Approved</h3>
<p>Since the tax evasion incident at the Pinzhen Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road, the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Division has been strictly investigating businesses that evade customs duties and harm the national treasury. Recently, it was found that Yisheng Foreign Goods Store, opened by Liu Mingjia, a native of Huzhou, at 54 Jixian Lane, 195 Tianjin Road, had a large batch of silk that had not paid customs duties. They then requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant and, together with Liang Baosheng, a Chinese detective from the Tax Investigation Office of the Public Concession, went to search the premises at 12:30 p.m. on the 25th of last month. Because there was a lot of silk, worth more than 160,000 yuan, it could not be completely confiscated. Only one-quarter of the silk, 272 boxes, as well as account books and other items, were taken back to the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, which ordered that the seized items be detained and the account books be handed over to the customs for investigation. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Now, Yisheng intends to follow the precedent of Pinzhen by submitting a request to the First Special District Court to allow them to provide a guarantee and have the detained silk returned first. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Second Criminal Court to investigate whether to allow bail. Liu Mingjia also appeared in court with his attorney, Yu Xiangqin. They stated that the silk seized was worth more than 40,000 yuan when purchased, but is now only worth 27,500 yuan. They requested permission to provide a guarantee and have it returned first. The representative of the Jianghai Customs, Shen Shikun, testified that the account books of Yisheng were difficult to examine because they used an old-fashioned accounting method. In addition to the seized goods, three-quarters of the goods remained at Yisheng, which made the examination slightly more difficult. According to the Customs investigation, most of the goods were tax-evading, except for a small portion that had already paid customs duties. As for Yisheng's request for bail, silk is not the same as pearls. Each piece of silk has a number. If the numbers are switched, the examination will be difficult. The Customs has obtained considerable evidence of its tax evasion and will be able to present it when necessary. The court then inquired about the value of the goods seized by Yisheng, whether it was true, and which articles of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations its actions violated. The Customs representative replied that the Customs has a special department to estimate the value and that he could not answer. However, he was certain that it would not be the amount stated. As for the articles of law violated, they were Articles 21 and 22 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Law. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, did not express an opinion on Yisheng's request for bail because the police were only assisting. He requested that the court exercise its own judgment. Judge Dai examined the warrant and stated that Yisheng had not provided sufficient proof of the value of the goods. It should be verified after proof is provided whether or not to approve the guarantee. The court then adjourned, so Yisheng's request for bail is not yet optimistic. Request the court to examine the body.</p>

<h3>Nephew Came to Stay, Used Ax on Cousin</h3>
<p>Wu Jinyuan, a farmer in Shiziyuan Township, Caojing District, West Shanghai, had a son, Lin Fu, who farmed at home. At 8:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, his nephew, Shen Heshang, a plasterer from Caobei, Caojiaqiao, Shanghai County, came to his house with an unnamed friend to visit Wu Jinyuan. He thought it was a normal visit from relatives. That night, they stayed in his son's bedroom. In the middle of the night, he suddenly heard cries for help from the room. Jinyuan quickly got up and went to check, but Shen Heshang and the others had fled without a trace. He found that Lin Fu had been slashed in the head with an ax, with a wound about three inches long and half an inch deep behind his left ear. Blood was flowing like a torrent, and he was moaning in pain. An inspection of the room revealed that no clothing or items were missing. He immediately sent the injured man to Shanghai Hospital for diagnosis and treatment and reported the incident to the local police station, requesting that the murderer be arrested and investigated. After receiving the report, Director Wu immediately sent detectives to Shanghai Hospital to inspect the injuries and investigate the truth of the murder.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Teachers' Association Sends Telegram to the Central Government Requesting an Explicit Order to Suppress the Rebellion</h3>
<p>Also Sends Telegram to Song, Shang, and Han Xunyu for Pacifying the Rebellion; Also Sends Telegram to Wang Xiacai Urging Him to Repent</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Teachers' Association held an emergency meeting of the board of directors at Zhenjiang Normal School yesterday morning. Huang Boqin, Rong Weisheng, Zhang Tongmo, Wu Cangsu, Wu Zonghan, Zhang Shaonan, and others attended. Huang Boqin presided over the meeting and discussed the following important cases: (1) How should we express our views on Yin's rebellion and betrayal of the country? It was resolved to send a telegram to the central government requesting an explicit order to suppress the rebellion, and to send telegrams to Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, and Han Fuju requesting them to suppress the rebellion immediately. (2) How should we express our views on Wang Xiacai's adherence to the rebellion? It was resolved to warn Wang Xiacai and urge him to repent. (3) When will the next representative conference be held? It was decided to hold it on March 11th, 1936, at the Yixing Ceramics Vocational School. The meeting adjourned. The telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government: To all members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission, the heads of all the Yuan, and the ministers of all the Bu: As reported, Yin Rugeng is willing to be a puppet, inciting chaos in eastern Hebei, betraying the central government, and endangering the Republic of China. When the news spread, the people of the whole country were outraged. Such a heartless and mad act is a self-inflicted wound to the country and is not allowed by the national law. We request you to issue an explicit order to suppress the rebellion immediately to curb the chaos and maintain the law. Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Teachers' Association respectfully</p>
<p>Telegram to Song and Shang: To Director Song of Beiping Pacification, Chairman Shang of Baoding, and Chairman Han of Jinan: Yin Rugeng is willing to be a puppet, inciting chaos in eastern Hebei and endangering the Republic of China. His crime is unforgivable. We believe that you are known for your public loyalty. Please unite to denounce him and uphold the law to pacify the source of the chaos. The country and the nation depend on it. Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Teachers' Association respectfully</p>
<p>Telegram to the Rebel Wang: As reported, Yin Rugeng is willing to be a puppet, inciting chaos in eastern Hebei. The people of the whole country are outraged. However, you, sir, are also following along and participating. You cannot distinguish between righteousness and profit. There is a way to get rich, why sell your personality to seek it? Moreover, the enemy is insidious and vicious, as the world knows. Once the birds are gone, the bow is put away. Can you, sir, really become rich? Now, Mr. Huo Shi has already refused the rebellious order. What a bright attitude! Truly, the head can be cut off, the family can be destroyed, but a traitor cannot be. What we hope from you, sir, is to rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff and repent. If you insist on going your own way, you will cut yourself off from our Jiangsu and from our country. The world will ask what kind of person you are. As the saying goes, "Condemned by a thousand people, one will die without illness." To be disgraced is not something a wise man would do. We hope you will carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this matter.</p>

<h3>Little Men (116)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"What you asked me to do, I'm not too worried about—Mother always loves me anyway," replied Rob, now that almost all was lost, he had to cling to the last great support.</p>
<p>"I'm really hungry, let's eat these berries," proposed Dan after a short pause, by which time Rob had begun to doze off.</p>
<p>"I'm hungry too, but I can't eat mine, because I told Mother I would give them all to her."</p>
<p>"You have to eat them, if no one comes to get us," answered Nan, who at this point felt like she had to object to everything. Then she said a few terrible words, "If we stay here for many days, we'll have to eat all the berries in the field, and then we can only wait to die."</p>
<p>"I will eat camphor tree leaves, I know a big yellow camphor tree, Don told me how the squirrels dig up the roots to eat. I love digging too," replied Rob, who was not frightened by the prospect of starving to death.</p>
<p>"That's right; we can catch frogs and cook them. My father ate some, and he said they tasted really good," Nan chimed in, still looking for some adventurous things to do, even though she was lost in the wilderness.</p>
<p>"How can we cook frog meat? We don't have any fire."</p>
<p>"Then I don't know; next time we need to have tinder in our bags," said Nan, feeling very disappointed that her experiment of cooking frog meat had met with resistance.</p>
<p>"Can't we get fire from fireflies?" Rob suddenly asked optimistically, because he saw sparks flying around as if they had wings. (Note 1)</p>
<p>"Let's try it," so they spent several minutes chasing fireflies, trying to use them to light one or two green twigs. "Calling them fireflies is really deceiving, they don't have any fire at all," said Nan, throwing away a gloomy insect in contempt, even though it was the brightest one, and it was still happily flitting up and down between the branches, entertaining this pair of naive experimenters.</p>
<p>(Note 1) The Wu dialect "游火蟲" (yóu huǒ chóng) probably refers to "萤火蟲" (yíng huǒ chóng). The sound of "但游火蟲" (dàn yóu huǒ chóng) is quite poetic, so this book decides to call them "游火蟲" (yóu huǒ chóng).</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Cross-Country Race: Guanghua Absent Due to Exams</h3>
<p>Willing to Have a Friendly Match with Fudan</p>
<p>A letter from the Guanghua University Cross-Country Team states that the Jiangnan University Cross-Country Championship, originally scheduled for 2:30 PM on November 30th at Jinan University in Zhenru, was postponed due to rain to 2:30 PM on December 4th at the original location. However, our school only learned of this news on December 3rd, and the school is currently holding a mini-exam this week, so we requested a rescheduling to the end of this week. Jinan University agreed, but Fudan not only refused to reschedule but also moved the time forward to 12:00 PM on December 4th. Our team members have exams from 10:00 to 12:00 AM and 1:00 to 2:00 PM that morning, so they cannot participate. Our school has always opposed sacrificing studies for sports. We are afraid that the outside world will not understand the difficulties of our school's inability to participate, so we specially send this letter to inform you. Furthermore, our school sincerely wishes to invite the Fudan University Cross-Country Team to visit us for guidance during any holiday to compensate for this missed opportunity for joint practice. Guanghua University Cross-Country Team, December 4th.</p>

<h3>Securities: Multi-Party Gradually Leaks Out, Bonds Slightly Loosen Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the situation seemed to have a solution on the surface, but there were still many rumors. In short, the North China incident sought a solution in an insoluble situation, so it was ultimately impossible to be optimistic. The bank's interest rate cut was only a discussion among peers, and the rumors were all superficial. The fact that the large multi-party players in the field are gradually leaking out is a definite fact, so there is the fact that the market is rising from the previous bad environment and the market price is trending down from the current slightly stabilized environment. What's more, there is no favorable solution to the situation? The chips in the field are crowded, and the number of transactions is too high. Any slight shake will cause waves. Observing under the circumstances that the large multi-party players have stopped raising prices, there is still a small face in the future. Yesterday, only two sessions were done. At the beginning of the opening, it was slightly weak, because Nos. 43, 48, and 54, etc. had a lot of buying, and the market price turned high. Nos. 4, 11, 34, and 77 sold, and it still felt that demand was greater than supply. Since the 19th, it has risen 1, 2 jiao to 4 jiao, but because the selling pressure is still strong, the second session has fallen back sharply. The selling accounts were surging with Nos. 4, 11, and 35. The salt tax fell by 9 jiao and a half, which was the most. The closing was weak and recovering, with highs and lows seen alternately, but there were more rises than falls, and most were better by 1, 2 jiao to 4 jiao. As a result of the market price, except for a few that rose by 1, 2 jiao, most of them saw a slight loosening again. The largest drop was 7 jiao and a half for the loss of the edition this month. The total number of transactions was 23,040,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit Yuan Transaction Unit Hundred Yuan)</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung Trading Company stated that yesterday (the 4th), the New York stock market rose with very active trading. This was due to several companies increasing their dividends and good business conditions. Furthermore, with Congress soon to convene, talk of inflation has resurfaced. Stocks on the small exchange rose slightly, and the bond market was also strong. The total trading volume for the day was 2.94 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Date　4th　Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　142.58　144.04　Up 0.46</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　40.46　41.74　Up 1.28</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks　28.92　29.11　Up 0.19</p>
<p>40 Bonds　97.66　97.84　Up 0.18</p>
<p>11 Commodities　56.16　55.94　Down 0.13</p>
<h3>Looseness and Excess of Yarn and Cotton Chip　Yarn and Cotton Plunge　Rapid Advance and Retreat, Speculation is Fearful</h3>
<p>After the sharp rise in the yarn market the previous day, those taking profits started selling, and market prices plummeted again. This situation of sharp rises and falls is entirely due to the fervor of general speculators. However, the financial sector continued to buy in the previous session. Only Mr. Lin of the gold group had a large amount of selling to close out positions. In the afternoon, the trading floor turned downward, and the decline started abruptly, appearing turbulent. Currently, industry players are generally in short positions, and the pressure can be intense when opportunities arise. However, there is currently strong demand for raw yarn, it is said.</p>
<p>Gold and Chicken Plunge by More Than Three Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning session of the yarn auction, the opening bids for all months were consistently low, and the decline was fierce. After the previous day's surge, some bulls exited. Another theory is that the shorts were preparing to settle with spot goods, causing the market to become even more depressed. However, banks continued to absorb, but were still unable to curb the false rebound. Tongji Yuan Yi purchased heavily, while Changfeng Hexing also sold short in large quantities. As a result, all months fell by 1.2568 yuan. When trading opened in the afternoon, the morning bulls exited, the trading floor loosened considerably, and market prices trended downstream.

<h3>American Ann Exits　Auction Cotton also Declines Sharply</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply, and the decline was even more severe. After the surge the previous day, those taking profits closed out positions, causing looseness and excess of chips in the market, and market prices plummeted. It is said that the American Ann Trading Company, a bull, exited, but the Japanese-owned East Cotton Trading Company bought a large amount, it is said.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Falls Back by About One Yuan</p>
<p>In the morning session of the auction cotton, the opening bids for all months fell sharply and the situation was weak. Because American and Indian cotton were unfavorable, they turned downward. The bulls took the opportunity to exit, and market prices were weak. However, Tongji Yuan Yi absorbed in large quantities. As a result, all months fell by 0.45 to 0.65 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The opening in the afternoon was still good, as the Japanese-owned East Cotton bought. However, when bidding reached the second and third rounds, the decline became severe. The Fuhjia Trading Company, a bull, sold in large quantities, and the market chips were abundant, causing market prices to fall. However, the large amount of financing remained unchanged. Distant months rebounded by 0.1 yuan at the close. As a result, all months fell by an additional 0.25 to 0.45 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tongji sold 2,400 dan, Dafu 2,000 dan, Meiji 2,200 dan, Hexing 2,800 dan, Shengyuan 1,900 dan, Xincheng 12,900 dan, Yikang 2,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,200 dan, Changhe 7,500 dan, Dachangcheng 2,600 dan, and Yongda 2,100 dan. Dafu bought 6,000 dan, Tongji 2,300 dan, Daji 1,900 dan, Jinchang 4,200 dan, Gengfeng 4,400 dan, Shenji 4,300 dan, Renfeng 3,000 dan, Yuanyi 6,000 dan, Yichang 4,700 dan, Runkang 3,500 dan, and Changhe 8,500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Depressed Again by Hedging Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton was depressed due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Bulls closed out positions and cotton farmers engaged in hedging sales, causing all months to fall by eight to ten points. Although the government intends to implement management measures in times of emergency, an unfavorable ruling by the High Court may affect the situation. In the middle of trading, some buying by industry players led to a slight rebound, but the selling of January contracts by cotton hoarders hindered buying sentiment again. Before the close, hedging sales and selling by local groups resulted in a 10-point drop in spot prices and a 9- to 19-point drop in futures prices. English spot cotton rose by one point, while futures fell by two to three points. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to buying by European exporters and retail investors, but weakened later due to selling by speculators. Overall, Pingguoer rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, and Umra rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees. Bairuoxi rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 4th):</p>
<p>American Cotton　Compared to Previous Day (Legal Tender)　English Cotton　Compared to Previous Day (Legal Tender)</p>

<h3>Grain　One Shipment of Foreign Barley Transacted　Long-Term Flour Plummets by Over 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, both near-term and long-term prices plummeted severely. The extent of the decline and the briskness of transactions set astonishing records. It was reported that the previous day's ending had already seen a slight drop of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan due to rumors of cotton and wheat price manipulation. Yesterday, it was reported that the factories had indeed transacted one shipment of foreign barley (4,500 tons) at a price of 6.58 yuan. Considering the facts, this pricing is not surprising. However, the bulls reacted with panic and dismay to this news. Although domestic supply is insufficient, foreign supplies have begun to arrive, causing extreme panic. The initial price drop was only 0.01 yuan, but then the factories released supplies, and large outside bulls sold off their positions, temporarily going short and aggressively adding to their positions, resulting in a drop of 0.05 to 0.07 yuan compared to the previous day's close. However, the market took another sharp dive in the afternoon session as the factories continued to release supplies and large bulls sold even more aggressively. Long-term contracts experienced an even more violent decline due to the foreign barley situation. Contracts for March and April plummeted by a massive 0.11 to 0.12 yuan, the first such major blow since the flour market's sharp rise.</p>
<p>Closing Price on the 4th　Closing Price on the 5th　Comparison</p>
<p>December Contracts　3.0825　3.0050　Down 0.0775</p>
<p>January Contracts　3.1075　3.0300　Down 0.0775</p>
<p>February　3.1425　3.0375　Down 0.1050</p>
<p>March Contracts　3.1750　3.0600　Down 0.250</p>
<p>April Contracts　3.1750　3.0600　Down 0.250</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Also Down Slightly by 0.08 to 0.09 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of wheat futures was down because of foreign barley prices, with Chicago falling by another 0.03 yuan and Canada falling by 0.02 to 0.04 yuan. It was reported that international wheat markets had softened because of a possible reconciliation between Italy and Abyssinia, leading to temporary calm in international affairs. Therefore, wheat prices softened, and spot wheat sales were also more active than before, so the opening price was 0.06 to 0.08 yuan lower than the previous day. However, the limited chips in the market limited trading, so the decline was relatively moderate. When trading opened in the afternoon, transactions were still active for each month, but there were few new short sellers, and market sentiment stabilized, so market conditions also turned sideways. The fate of future price fluctuations will depend on whether or not foreign barley is ordered. Because standard wheat has plummeted, factories are rejecting it and there are no transactions for single bags, it is said.</p>
<p>Closing Price on the 4th　Closing Price on the 5th　Comparison</p>
<p>November Contracts　4.99　4.90　Down 0.09</p>
<p>January Contracts　5.10　5.05　Down 0.05</p>
<p>February Contracts　5.17　5.07　Down 0.10</p>
<p>March Contracts　5.18　5.11　Down 0.07</p>
<p>Canada's new policy for overseas wheat aims to reduce its surplus by means of competition, not by aggressive price cuts. This is bad news for short sellers.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat　3rd　4th　Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>May　96.625　95.625　Down 1.00</p>

<h3>He Xia Rice Prices Mixed</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) The source of goods thinned out yesterday, with a total of only 30-odd firms (goods totaling over 1,000 shi). Sales in this street were normal, and the demand for packaged goods remained strong. There were continued purchases of over 3,000 packages by Tianjin, Weihai, Qingdao, and Yantai firms. Prices for "thin rice" were up 0.07 yuan, while prices for thick粳 (japonica) rice and early rice remained stable. "Du Yang Jian" rice remained flat. Yin Bianyuan rice saw no change.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) There were 46 or 47 sources of goods. Sales of premium white粳 (japonica) rice were slow, and warehouses continued to move. Market prices were down by several cents to nearly a dime. Early rice followed with a small drop of nearly a dime. Sales of "thin rice" remained acceptable. Purchases by Tianjin firms continued, and prices were stable. Sales of Yangbu Jian were slightly slow, and prices were soft. Premium customer grade rice was stable. Yin Yuanting showed strength. Bai Yuandian sales were active, with purchases by distilleries, and prices were up 0.2 yuan. Prices for all other goods were slightly softer than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Still Some Speculators Buying Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Arrivals of passenger xian rice were still brisk yesterday, especially for Jiangxi and Wenzhou/Taizhou rice. Shops and speculators were very keen on purchasing. Due to cost considerations, vendors were unwilling to sell at low prices, so mid- and low-grade rice prices continued to rise by 0.06 to 0.1 yuan. Prices for high-grade goods and some customer xian rice remained stable because merchants were not keen on purchasing. For the whole day, 2,753 packages of Jiangxi rice, 100 packages of Hunan rice, and 2,500 packages of Wenzhou/Taizhou/Ningbo rice were released and purchased by stores and speculators in this street. Only 200 small packages of foreign rice were released, and other grades were held back.</p>
<h3>Oil Market　Shaoxing Firms Suddenly Try to Purchase Guide Sesame Oil</h3>
<p>– Raw Materials Are Expensive… Price Opens at 19.8 Yuan –</p>
<p>The sesame oil market situation, because prices are high, is not easy to stimulate the sales of customer firms. Although Bengbu goods often see transactions of ten or eight dan, the Henan goods that have been quiet for a long time remain unmoved. Yesterday, the Shaoxing oil shops suddenly started to purchase, transacting one hundred loads of Guide goods, which is about 28 dan according to the Simaji scale. The gloss and aroma of this good are both excellent, and the price opened at 19.8 yuan. The motivation for Shaoxing firms to purchase is because the price of raw sesame seeds has been driven high by Western firms making large purchases. The cost of sesame seeds is not low, so the cost of extracting oil cannot be calculated, so there is a motivation to start purchasing sesame oil. It is said that this transaction is experimental in nature. Whether it is possible to continue purchasing in the future is unknown.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market　Beihai Sliced Green Sugar Opens at 500 Boxes</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was slightly stable yesterday, and there were signs of a rebound. The association's marked price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 21.8 yuan for spot goods, with some transactions. Transshipment goods were quoted at 6.8 yuan, up 0.05 yuan, but were not sold. The Benchang cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 20.8 yuan. A Hong Kong firm quoted 500 boxes of Beihai sliced green sugar at 8.8 yuan. Jianbang quoted several hundred packages of Chen Zalu green sugar at 9.2 yuan, and the next grade at 8.9 yuan. East red sugar was quoted at the original price, and East white sugar was quoted at 0.05 yuan. No. 8 spot goods were 21.65 yuan, and transshipment goods were 6.6 yuan. No. 9 was 21.45 yuan, and transshipment goods were 6.45 yuan. None of these were sold. However, No. 4 East white sugar for transshipment rose, with transactions at 6.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods　Yuan Yu Silk Rises by Over One Yuan</h3>
<p>Blue and Red Broadcloth Also Rises… Western Satin Stabilizes</p>
<p>Yesterday was the quotation day for Yuan Fang Foreign Firm. Western satin was auctioned for six brands, totaling 180 pieces. Market conditions were similar to the previous period. Yuan velvet had two brands, totaling 40 pieces, and prices stabilized. Yuan Yu silk had 38 brands, totaling 1,320 pieces. Prices were mostly higher than the previous month. The Cile, Zhulin, Caibashi, Andianbao, and Shibatako brands all rose by over one yuan. Only the Qingsui Tu, Weimiaoweixiao, and Hainiu brands were slightly lower. The remaining brands all rose by several dimes. Yuan Zhigong had one box, totaling 20 pieces, and prices were slightly better. In addition, blue and red broadcloth had 30 pieces each, and prices also rose, it is said.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on the "Hu Shi Style"</h3>
<p>— Chen Ziyun</p>
<p>Some people advise Hu Shi to talk about politics, some advise him to talk about thought, and some advise him to talk about literature. Hu Shi cannot help but sigh and say:</p>
<p>"This is truly my crossroads"!</p>
<p>Mr. Hu, talking about politics is not your path, talking about thought is not your path. I still advise you to take the path of literature, and to narrow the scope a bit, to take the path of new poetry. But I am not hoping that you will still take the old path of "Collection of Attempts." A poem like "Ode to the Airplane" (see Li Bao "Yan Lin" "Miscellaneous Poems from Penglu," only the line "See the Guilin landscape," shares a character with mountain.) that kind of poem, seems to be able to be called a new path. The old path has not removed the traces of imitating old poetry, and is really like a foot that has been bound too tightly being released. The new path has only accepted the influence of old poetry, or rather has transformed from poetry, like a silkworm has become a moth. For example, the poem "Ode to the Airplane," its rhythm is like Xin Jiaxuan's short poem, but it does not seem to be intentionally imitated. Wen Yiduo's "Winter Night Review" says: "The rhythm of Ci and Qu is not entirely contraband in the realm of new poetry, but it must be subjected to a round of checking and sampling." These are convincing words.</p>
<p>I do not advise people to accept any "literary heritage," and even less will I pay homage to ancient literary books, claiming to be elegant and erudite. But if someone who likes old literature gets a good influence from it, and learns a useful technique, I will definitely not say that he "has the suspicion of reversing the car." Moreover, the new poetry movement is still far from the day of success, and the road to new poetry is definitely not just one, so it is okay to "reach the same goal by different routes." A "Hu Shi style" like "Ode to the Airplane" can undoubtedly be considered a path, just like the "Feng Yuxiang style" that I have mentioned before. As for the "satirical poems" and "folk song poems" that I have proposed (both can be found in Li Bao's "Yan Lin"), as well as the "peasant poems" (see Freedom Forum of the year before last) and "mass language poetry" (see Social Monthly) that I proposed before, even though no poets have left noble footprints, it is okay for someone to take them, even though the road has different sizes, widths, levels, and dangers.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu, do not say "there is a heart to advocate, but no creation." I very much hope that you will still bring out the spirit of a pioneer and create a kind of "Hu Shi style" in new poetry. This seems to be a path in your future, and it may as well be a path in the new poetry movement, one of many paths, even if it is a failure, you can also tell countless newcomers "this road does not work"!</p>
<p>Postscript: Someone told me that there is an essay on poetry in the third issue of Shenbao Literary Weekly that criticizes my opinion on the "Hu Shi style." Coincidentally, both the Literary Weekly and Li Bao (which contains my poetry) were borrowed by a friend, so I could not check them. I had no choice but to rely on my current limited understanding and first write this short article. November 20, 1935, written by lamp.</p>
<h3>Streamlined</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>The Child's Heart</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>It was truly something I could never have dreamed of – meeting an old classmate, Lao Li, from middle school in this foreign land thousands of miles away. I had no idea that my remote corner of the world was actually his hometown. We've been apart for almost ten years, counting back. Ten years is a large chapter in a person's life, so this unexpected encounter today is especially delightful. Although the world has changed completely during this long period, and we have each had remarkable and moving experiences, it's gratifying that we can still grasp a semblance of our former selves. As for looking a little older, that's inevitable.</p>
<p>Here, there are quite a few old classmates working; in fact, there are three of us who were in the same class. In addition, there's a Mr. ×, whom we used to call × Da Boy back in middle school. Time hasn't built barriers between us; after the initial surprise, the old routine of joking, teasing, and scolding reappeared. Lao Li is still Lao Li, × Da Boy is still × Da Boy, and I'm still me. It's a bit strange to think about: whose hand pulled us together from the ends of the earth, then separated us, only to reunite us here again?</p>
<p>To say there haven't been any changes would be false. Lao Li's child has already entered middle school. He came here this time to drop off the student – a child almost as old as we were in middle school, standing before us respectfully and innocently, reminding me of my own shy and self-satisfied demeanor when I was a child in front of my elders. This young child is already a husband! We teased Lao Li about this, joking that he had done something improper and was still so feudal, perhaps wanting to rush the creation of descendants to enjoy the blessing of five generations under one roof. We even joked that he would inevitably have his wife and daughter-in-law competing to have children.</p>
<p>The child listened to our jokes, seeming to understand but unable to interject a word.</p>
<p>"Lao Li, how old is your daughter-in-law?" someone asked, pressing him with another kind of smile.</p>
<p>"Um, um, I can't say for sure, but around nineteen, I think." His face flushed slightly.</p>
<p>"And the child?"</p>
<p>"The child is fourteen years old."</p>
<p>A round of applause and laughter followed. The child seemed a bit embarrassed and slipped away awkwardly. Lao Li entrusted the child to us before leaving, finally adding, "You must come to my home for a visit! It's only forty li away."</p>
<p>After Lao Li left, the child often came to my room. Although I didn't teach his classes, he was even more affectionate with me than with his actual teachers. His expression made my room seem like a warm home to him. The child was very quiet, with a light in his eyes that was as unfathomable as his father's. However, it didn't inspire fear but rather made people love him even more. As usual, he wouldn't initiate a conversation himself, fiddling with this and touching that.</p>
<p>A bit of warmth compelled me to ask him how he was doing, and eventually, I broached the subject of his shyness.</p>
<p>"When did you get married?"</p>
<p>"Last year."</p>
<p>"How old is your wife?"</p>
<p>"Twenty!" I almost burst out laughing. Children, after all, don't lie. After saying this, he became as shy as a girl.</p>
<p>"Why did you get married so early?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. It wasn't my dad's idea. My aunt told me to get married."</p>
<p>"Is she good to you?"</p>
<p>"..." His cheeks puffed up, but he couldn't get the words out.</p>
<p>I then asked who made his clothes and shoes, but he still couldn't say. So, I changed the topic. I asked him about the scenery around his village, his family's house, and the number of people in his household. This gave him a chance to speak. He said that the village was on the bank of the Grand Canal and that he often stood on the embankment to fish. He also said that his family had a small boat and could go out on the water whenever they wanted. "It's so much fun to steer a boat in the water!" he said, moving his hands as if they had already become oars. He said that the big flood this year had submerged over a hectare of their land, and they hadn't seen any of their crops. He also said that his mother had just given birth to a little brother last year, but he wasn't living with them. A nanny was taking care of him, but it was very close, and they could bring him over to play anytime. Finally, he described his house, drawing a diagram on the table with his small hands. He said he hoped we could come to his house and stay in the guest room. During the day, he would take us to play on the river embankment. He spoke animatedly, as if we were already on our way to his home.</p>
<p>It was another unexpected opportunity that one of my younger uncles came to study here as well. I quickly brought them together, which was very fitting. The children of classmates were both equally innocent and lovable, with the only difference being that my younger uncle was more lively and interesting. They immediately became inseparable. My younger uncle had arrived later and taught him everything with the attitude of an elder, but there was only affectionate help, without any arrogance. On Saturdays, he took him to all the famous sights here. Before they left, I gave them ten cents for candy (ten cents was a considerable sum in their eyes!). They came back in the afternoon, covered in dirt, and reported their travels and the expenditure of the ten cents, patting their small, black uniform cloth bags, which still jingled with copper coins.</p>
<p>Indeed, my room had become their warm home. After lunch or dinner, they invariably came by, and they always came as a pair. Although there wasn't much to say besides asking about their homework, seeing the two children leaning on the table looking so delightful was enough to bring comfort. At the same time, I thought that this room must also be giving them just as much comfort.</p>
<p>For the first few days, he kept saying that he wanted to go home on Saturday because the dean of students said that students could go home to get winter clothes that afternoon without asking for leave. He asked me when I would come to his house and also asked Teacher Yang when he would go. We all vaguely promised him that we would definitely go on Saturday.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, when I returned after dinner, they were already sitting under the lamp. As soon as he saw me, he suddenly asked, "Teacher, what time will you get up tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"To go where?"</p>
<p>This question made my younger uncle very happy. He immediately clapped his hands and said triumphantly, "I said you wouldn't go! I said you wouldn't go!" My younger uncle meant that he didn't want either of us to leave because he would be too lonely.</p>
<p>My younger uncle was overjoyed by my words, but the other boy was utterly disappointed and couldn't say another word. After a while, he turned to my younger uncle and said, "You're going too!"</p>
<p>"No, no, I'm not going to your house!" My younger uncle's playful energy returned as he shook his head and waved his arms.</p>
<p>"How can you be so heartless! He invited you so nicely!..." As soon as he said those words, he regretted saying too much. It was clear that my younger uncle had only said those untrue words because time didn't allow it. If I could have taken back those two sentences, I would have, but as it was, those words had made the child feel a bit sour. I watched him turn and run to Teacher Yang's room. I could hear him from behind.</p>
<p>"Teacher Yang, when will you come to my house tomorrow?"</p>
<p>Teacher Yang also hesitated. "Um, um, I'm not feeling well, and the time is too short..."</p>
<p>"Teacher, please go! You can definitely come back the day after tomorrow if you leave tomorrow. What's so bad about asking for a few hours of leave?"</p>
<p>"I'm too busy with my studies, and I've only been here for a short time. It wouldn't be good to ask for leave just to have fun..."</p>
<p>He came back to my room for the second time. At that moment, my younger uncle had gone to another teacher's room. I saw that his small eyes were initially red under the lamplight. I looked away, not daring to look at him directly, for a moment, tears welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Don't be sad. I'll talk to your Teacher Yang, and we'll definitely be able to go..."</p>
<p>The tears fell at those words.</p>
<p>I felt very bad myself. We had shattered a child's beautiful dream with just a few sentences! I brought him a basin of water and handed him a towel. He had just finished washing when my younger uncle burst in, asking, "×××, you're going by yourself tomorrow, right!" As he spoke, he smacked his lips. The other boy didn't say a word, just rubbing his eyes hard with both small hands.</p>
<h3>Crows</h3>
<p>— Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>—One of the Sketches from the Frontier—</p>
<p>Crows are considered inauspicious by people. Hu Shi seems to have a new poem about crows: "I wake up early in the morning, standing on the roof of someone's house, cawing, cawing. People dislike me, saying I am unlucky." People dislike crows precisely because they caw, because they are gossipy and don't stay in their place.</p>
<p>I once lived in the gentle Jiangnan south of the Yangtze, with its beautiful sunny days, after traveling from this desert frontier in the north. I even strolled along the West Lake. However, in those places, I felt weak all over, unable to exert any strength. So, I deeply missed the desolate land beyond the Great Wall, swept by the howling northwest wind. However, what I missed most was the vast, boundless, blue sky, filled with thousands upon thousands of crows flying and wailing at dusk. They seemed to be lamenting the fate of all humanity, in harmony with the sound of the wind, like millions of stampeding cattle passing through the poplar trees! Oh! How truly I missed the desolate frontier while in the peaceful south!</p>
<p>Now, I have returned. It is just the beginning of winter, and the wind, like a mad tiger, roars ferociously from behind the Daqing Mountains, blowing so hard that one's heart shivers with cold. Icy white snow has piled up again on the peaks of the melancholy Daqing Mountains; it is winter! People have put on heavy old sheepskin coats and thick felt shoes. On the streets and roads, there are only a few pedestrians, shrunken with cold. The wind carries sand, swirling into everyone's eyes. The withered poplar trees make a rustling, mournful sound. You might truly think: "Have I arrived in the uninhabited Arctic?"</p>
<p>However, what is still commendable is the crow, which is considered unlucky by people. I wake up in the morning. The wind is howling, and the world seems to be approaching the end of days. Only the cawing of crows on the old trees behind the house reminds you that you are still in a world of flesh and blood. However, after I get up, as the crows search for food in the wilderness, Guihua City becomes as silent as death.</p>
<p>Until evening, when the sunset in the west reflects on the roofs of people's homes, it is the time when "night birds return to their nests." Countless crows are scattered across the sky, forming long, large formations. Their shrill cawing, accompanied by the sound of the frontier's fierce wind, seems to possess a force—a force of life—and only then do you feel that you have returned to the human world.</p>
<p>Oh! Crows! Are you truly inauspicious things!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Memories of Fleeing from Disaster</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Fleeing from disaster is usually a miserable and painful experience, but I have tasted its sweetness. However, this was when I was very young, when I heard that government troops were attacking from the provincial capital and that the Tongzhi Society's forces couldn't hold them back. My family hastily fled to our relatives' home at dusk. In reality, our relatives' home was only two or three li away, so fleeing was almost the same as not fleeing at all. But in the end, we still fled. The reason was that they were cutting down large cypress trees there, and in front of the house, behind the house, beside the walls, and under the fences, there were many holes dug for the roots that could be used to hide from bullets. I only learned this later from the adults. However, at the time, in my eyes, they were just good places to play games with my little friends.</p>
<p>Farmers are generally very frugal and stingy, but when we arrived at our destination, my second grandfather—my grandfather's younger brother, who was a farmer—instructed the family to put out those good things that we were only allowed to eat during the New Year and festivals on the table illuminated by the vegetable oil lamp, such as preserved eggs and salted duck eggs. He sat beside us, accompanying us, and said with a somewhat apologetic expression:</p>
<p>"Eat a little as you please!... Why didn't you come earlier? We're killing two chickens today."</p>
<p>My grandfather, who was in a depressed mood, suddenly put down his bowl and chopsticks when he heard that the chickens had been killed for us to eat, and sighed deeply:</p>
<p>"In times of chaos and strife, even chickens and dogs suffer!"</p>
<p>"Well, it's better to eat them ourselves!... Are you still keeping any?"</p>
<p>My second grandfather smiled bitterly, answering in a somewhat self-deprecating manner. Then the two old men looked at each other, nodding their heads with queues in agreement.</p>
<p>Seeing the elders not eating in this unpleasant atmosphere, my mother and uncles were undoubtedly very restrained, but I was the happiest. Because at home, my mother was extremely strict about my dinner, and when she saw that I had eaten two bowls and was about to add another, she would take the spoon from my hand, pat me on the shoulder, and gently comfort me:</p>
<p>"Listen to Mom, eat one less bite at dinner, and you'll live to be ninety-nine!"</p>
<p>That night, my mother didn't make any such encouragements, perhaps understanding that hoping someone would live to be ninety-nine in these times was just a laughable matter? My second grandmother sat beside me, holding chopsticks and eating some vegetables with us. Seeing that my arms were too short and there were things I couldn't reach, she would often pick them up for me and pile them on top of my rice, saying with a forced smile:</p>
<p>"When you grow up, don't forget your second grandmother!"</p>
<p>It was as if this dinner had great significance.</p>
<p>That night, everyone slept on thick layers of straw spread on the ground, as if on a bed. The adults seemed to be unable to bear the hardship, but I, on the other hand, felt it was very interesting. At home, my younger brother had a habit of wetting the bed every night. Although my mother washed the blankets frequently and often aired the mats, it was never as warm and dry as it was here. Moreover, in order to be able to run out and hide easily upon hearing the sound of bullets, the front and back doors were kept wide open, allowing the cool night air of late autumn to freely enter, making the house naturally fresh and clean. At the same time, I could lean on my pillow before falling asleep, open my eyes, and watch the starry sky standing on the eaves, peeking at people.</p>
<p>Living in the same courtyard as my second grandfather was another family of relatives, who were of the same generation as my deceased great-grandfather. The youngest child in this family had me call him Great-Grandfather, which was something I was extremely unwilling to do. Moreover, almost the entire family smoked opium, and the house was always quiet, with only some sickly faces visible under the dim opium lamp, occasionally making the sound of inhaling smoke. When I was brought there to play, I never attracted their attention, just sullenly leaning on the adults, as if my hands and feet were tied. But this time fleeing from disaster was different. When my grandmother took me there the next morning, my hands were filled with smooth, shiny chestnuts, which would slip onto the floor with a clatter every time I moved, making me rush to catch this one and pick up that one. I was extremely happy to be put in such a predicament. My grandmother, eating a chestnut, declined, saying:</p>
<p>"That's enough, that's enough, aunt, keep them!"</p>
<p>Our young great-aunt, however, grabbed out many more, saying:</p>
<p>"Keep them? Keep them for outsiders to eat? In times like these!"</p>
<p>Behind the courtyard ran a white soil river, which only filled with water for a few days during the rainy season in summer. On ordinary days, it was completely dry, with sand and soil exposed, allowing the families on both banks to plant peanuts and wheat in the spring and autumn. My aunts and mother, during these days of fleeing disaster, felt suffocated and wanted to find some interesting things to do to relieve their anxious mood. Somehow, they learned the good news that Yaoshu's fiancée was digging peanuts in the sandy land on the other side of the river. Everyone agreed to secretly watch in the afternoon, and naturally, I was taken along too. Perhaps the future bride had hidden away. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Singing and Weeping</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Singing and weeping is a common phenomenon in times of chaos. It was so at the end of the Qing dynasty, and it was so at the end of the Ming dynasty. During some events not long ago, we could still see telegrams, petitions, slogans, and posters. In short, we still had voices, and we still had tears. Even the Old Buddha, who claimed to be "undisturbed by gain or loss," cried a great deal.</p>
<p>This loud sound was once ridiculed by everyone, and I was one of those who ridiculed them. Why ridicule them? The reason is very simple: what I ridiculed was not the telegrams, petitions, slogans, and posters, but the people who sent, petitioned, shouted, and posted, who only knew how to send, petition, shout, and post, and had no other way, and no other positive actions. If they were shouting and posting while putting the slogans into practice, then I would still hope they would shout a few more times and post a few more posters.</p>
<p>In times of chaos, there must be some sound, and therefore, there is singing and weeping. However, those who only sing and weep, or only know how to sing and weep, should be satirized and ridiculed.</p>
<p>But since last year, we have gradually felt calm, and we haven't heard any sound. This is not because satire has succeeded. This nation has become accustomed. Its nerves are becoming increasingly numb, and it no longer has joy or anger, and it no longer has singing or weeping.</p>
<p>So, we are only silent, silent, silent.</p>
<p>Throwing down a huge stone, and not hearing a single echo; cutting off a piece of fat, and not shedding a single drop of blood. This is truly a strange desert!</p>
<p>However, what everyone hopes for is singing and weeping.</p>
<p>Since we can't find it in people today, let's copy a poem from the ancients. Gong Ding'an's poem says:</p>
<p>Having experienced all kinds of situations in famous places, it was never out of feeling for the common people.</p>
<p>After mourning in the west, celebrate in the east; singing and weeping for the former sages is more affectionate.</p>
<p>The predecessors were only like this, that's all. Common people, common people!</p>
<h3>"Writing Essays"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>In Mr. Zhou Zuoren's essay collection, "Bitter Tea Essays," there are several excellent essays on literature: "The Second Temple Fair," "Willows," and "Two Essays on Writing." In recent years, Mr. Zhou has advocated the "theory of the uselessness of literature," saying: "Literature is only to satisfy the author's expression of thoughts and feelings, and there is no other purpose. There is not much motivating power in it, nor is there any teaching. It can only bring people a little pleasure." He only acknowledges that bringing people a little pleasure can be considered a use. Since the expressivist school revered him as a master, these words seem to have become the classics for essays that focus on leisure.</p>
<p>Speaking of the usefulness or uselessness of essays, this is inherently in relation to the impact on society. If an author expresses their thoughts and feelings in words, but locks it in a cabinet, never allowing it to see the light of day, then the theory of the uselessness of essays holds true. However, that is not the case. Mr. Zhou himself published his "Bitter Tea Essays" in the arts and literature section of the Ta Kung Pao, allowing millions of people to see it. Not only that, but it was also printed in black ink on white paper and compiled into a book, published by Beixin Bookstore, allowing millions more to read and see it. This has social significance. Mr. Zhou's thoughts arouse resonant reactions in millions of people; the cry of a nightingale vibrates the heartstrings of a poet, who writes a nightingale song, which then vibrates the heartstrings of millions of people for millions of years. No one can erase the effect of this cry. The theory of the uselessness of essays can only say that writing essays does not come with the function of being a stepping stone to success, besides expressing one's thoughts and feelings; as for the role of essays in society, the author has no right to decide; whether it is useful or useless.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou has said several times that he is from the Jiangnan naval forces and is an amateur when it comes to literature. But in his essay collection, the writing about writing essays is all accurate and practical. His essay, "My Experience Learning Chinese," has long become reading material for every young person. What is especially wonderful is that although he is touting the theory of the uselessness of essays, every one of the several essays on literature in "Bitter Tea Essays" shows the significance of the times. For example, "Willows" in the essays is precisely aimed at the retrograde movement of advocating reading the classics and reviving classical Chinese. He said:</p>
<p>"Students who specialize in classical Chinese in middle school cannot write essays. Writing classical Chinese (naturally, it's shoddy classical Chinese) is not difficult. You just need to first look at the topic, then find a style to match, and then write around the topic for a while, and you can succeed. But once you learn this, you become poisoned, and it is extremely difficult to quit. I usually don't give topics, and these students find it inconvenient, so I ask them to come up with their own, which are mostly large topics such as 'the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen,' and the essays are usually empty and broad. I advise them to change to smaller topics and try using vernacular Chinese, but after they write them, the authors themselves find it laughable, and the words and meanings are so childish, as if they were written by elementary school children. Ambitious students then decide to abandon everything they have learned and learn anew, starting from scratch to write ordinary essays, striving to use their own brains to think and writing in simple vernacular Chinese, while strictly preventing the revival and infiltration of shoddy classical Chinese ways of speaking and thinking. After working hard in this way, they can slowly recover. It can almost be said that it takes at least a year of hard work to purify the classical Chinese poison they have previously been infected with, and to re-learn the basics of essay writing. If they cannot do this, they can only continue to write shoddy classical essays, able to say empty words such as 'people's hearts are not as good as they used to be' or 'the land is vast and the resources are abundant,' but ultimately unable to express their own meaning. This means they are illiterate and cannot be saved."</p>
<p>When the quasi-old scholar teachers who teach students to read classical Chinese and write in classical Chinese see this passage, it is like having a bucket of cold water poured over their heads. Mr. Zhou's essays are accepted by young people, who know that to write coherent essays, they must follow this wide, flat road, and no one can deny his significance in society.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Zhou is always very clear-headed. He tells young people not to write those kinds of big topics, not to say empty words like "the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen," which is always earnest advice and prescribing the right medicine. He also criticizes Han Yu, saying: "I don't like Han Yu at all. His talent and essays are nothing special. He can be considered a model for scholars of all ages, but many things in China have been ruined by these scholars. They can only write essays and talk about the orthodoxy of thought, being vain, stubborn, and also ignorant and snobbish. Although they cannot become great traitors and cause great chaos, they are the most harmful in their petty meddling. As for Han Yu's writings, I can't understand his good points at all." ("The Second Temple Fair") This is also a kind of criticism. If everyone misunderstands Mr. Zhou's advocacy of "essays to satisfy the author's expression of thoughts and feelings," thinking that writing essays is only using a leisurely style to decorate elegance and pass the time, then they have fallen for the trick of the expressivist school's disciples.</p>

<h3>New Methods for Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Peiji</p>
<p>Gonorrhea, commonly known as "white turbidity," is recognized as a difficult disease to treat. It is relatively manageable during the acute and subacute stages, but becomes more challenging in chronic cases, especially those of long duration. In the past, treatment for gonorrhea mainly involved administering urinary tract disinfectants and performing local antiseptic washes. These methods were often painful and yielded limited results. While internal medication and washes are still employed, the drugs used are far more advanced than before. Currently, the most highly regarded therapies among physicians are electrical treatments, particularly the latest turbidimeter for acute cases and shortwave diathermy for chronic gonorrhea, both of which are highly effective. The former uses light to kill bacteria, while the latter uses electric and thermal energy. Shortwave diathermy can be administered through clothing, making it particularly convenient. In terms of pharmaceutical treatments, the combination of mixed gonorrhea vaccine and dyes is highly recommended, one to penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, and the other to stimulate auto-immunity. The effects are even better when used together. Among oral medications, Mesaltropin is particularly well-suited due to its strong bactericidal, antiseptic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is gentle on the stomach and intestines, and can restore inflamed areas of the urethral mucosa, making it highly favored by physicians. For local treatments, "Kolargol" is the safest option, as it can deeply penetrate the mucous membrane to effectively kill gonorrhea bacteria without harming the urethral mucosa. "Gono-Sorol," produced by the German Mann &amp;amp; Vilz Pharmaceutical Factory, is also excellent. This drug is made from gonorrhea serum and Sorol, and based on the principle of auto-immunity, its efficacy is comparable to that of vaccines. It is particularly effective when the infection is confined to the urethra. My old friend Mr. Feng Shanliang, who runs the Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city, has conducted extensive research on the treatment of gonorrhea. The hospital employs several male and female physicians specializing in different fields, and is equipped with all necessary electrical therapeutic devices. Fees are reasonable, and services are excellent. (Mesaltropin and Gono-Sorol are both sold by Renshou Western Pharmacy at 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, French Concession. The former costs one yuan per box, and the latter two yuan and fifty cents per box.)</p>
<h3>The Effects of Opium and Morphine on Blood Vessels</h3>
<p>— Physician She Lei</p>
<p>In animals severely poisoned by morphine, vasoparalysis occurs due to paralysis of the nerve origins of the blood vessels, leading to decreased vascular tension and lowered blood pressure. However, in humans, even medicinal doses can cause vasodilation, with the blood vessels of the skin being the first affected, followed by those of the face and brain, as these nerve centers are most susceptible. The resulting symptoms include a sensation of warmth, facial flushing, sweating, rashes, itching, and a slight increase in respiration and pulse. In larger doses, systemic vasodilation occurs, causing blood pressure to drop and facial redness to turn pale. The simultaneous dilation of brain and facial blood vessels is evidenced by increased respiration and pulse and cerebral congestion. Therefore, individuals prone to cerebral congestion should avoid morphine and opium preparations.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— Physician Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>The stomach is the main organ for digesting food and constantly secretes a digestive fluid containing hydrochloric acid, pepsin, enzymes, etc. Food entering the stomach mixes with this fluid, initiating a fermentation process that gradually digests the food. Gastric acid has antiseptic and bactericidal functions; it can kill bacteria mixed in with food. It also works with pepsin to transform beneficial substances in food into easily absorbed nutrients for the body. Gastric acid is extremely important for the human body and must be present in a certain amount. Too much or too little can cause disease, especially too much. The most common symptom of excessive stomach acid is stomach pain. While stomach pain can have other causes, it is most often due to excessive stomach acid. In addition to stomach pain, symptoms also include acid regurgitation, heartburn, and belching. Gastric acid has a strong irritant effect, and excessive acid can cause inflammation or ulcers due to excessive stimulation of the gastric mucosa, sometimes even leading to gastric bleeding. These issues are often overlooked in their early stages. The appropriate treatment for excessive stomach acid is to neutralize it. "Wei Bao" is particularly effective for those suffering from stomach pain and gastritis. This medication is a specific remedy for stomach pain and is effective for all types of stomach pain, including acute and chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers. It is currently sold by Renshou Western Pharmacy at 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, French Concession, for two yuan per box.</p>
<h3>The Remarkable Efficacy of Gono-Sorol in Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Cheng Luxue</p>
<p>The most reasonable and reliable treatment for gonorrhea is a combination of mixed gonorrhea vaccine injections and shortwave diathermy. However, due to time, geographical, financial, or occupational constraints, self-treatment may be necessary. Patients can only self-administer oral and local treatments. Among oral medications, "Mesaltropin" is the best and most effective choice. Its ability to penetrate membranes and kill bacteria is superior, and endorsements from famous doctors are frequently seen in newspapers, making it well-known in the medical community. Even general patients are happy to use it. As for external medications, antiseptic washes are commonly used. While doctors can adjust the time and concentration of these washes based on the patient's condition, patients administering them themselves are unlikely to achieve optimal results. Recently, the German Mann &amp;amp; Vilz Pharmaceutical Factory developed "GONO-SEROL," a local urethral medication for gonorrhea, which is made from gonorrhea serum and Sorol. When injected locally into the urethra, it provides auto-immune effects, resulting in accurate and effective healing. This medication is currently sold by Renshou Western Pharmacy at 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, French Concession, for two yuan and fifty cents per can.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Anti-Fungal Medicine: Fungus Destroyer</h3>
<p>— Physician Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Ringworm is a minor ailment, but it is difficult to find a specific remedy that is truly effective. An excellent treatment for ringworm should meet the following criteria: (1) It must have strong antibacterial and antiseptic properties without causing any harm to the skin. (2) It must completely eliminate pain and itching in the affected area. (3) The medication must be able to penetrate deeply into the skin layers without affecting internal organs through skin absorption. (4) It must not have an offensive odor or stain clothing. If all four of these qualities are present, it can be considered a sacred product. "Fungus Destroyer" is not only an excellent medicine for treating ringworm but also effective for all skin conditions. It is remarkably effective for scabies, chronic ringworm, weeping eczema, itchy rashes, pimples, etc. Its bactericidal power surpasses all ordinary products because it can penetrate deep into the skin layers to exert its powerful effects. It can also eliminate pain and itching with just one application. Furthermore, it has a pleasant fragrance and does not stain clothing. This product is one of the excellent medicines sold by Renshou Western Pharmacy at 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, French Concession.</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Treatment of Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Physician Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Neurasthenia can be said to be a common disease nowadays, especially among young people. This disease is divided into cerebral neurasthenia and sexual neurasthenia. The general common symptoms of cerebral neurasthenia are often heavy head, dizziness, poor memory, and insomnia. The general common symptoms of sexual neurasthenia are often spermatorrhea, seminal leakage, etc. There have been many articles on the treatment of this disease in newspapers. Although modern treatment methods have advanced and the general public's knowledge of medicine has increased, there has been no significant reduction in the progress of this disease. This is truly a deep social concern. In particular, sexual neurasthenia in young people is a local neurasthenic disease, not a severe cerebral neurasthenia systemic neurasthenic disease. It can also be said to be a disorder of the reproductive organs. Therefore, when treating this disease, although organic phosphorus and endocrine preparations that nourish the nervous system are indispensable essential medicines, local treatment is also indispensable. For example, the shortwave diathermy machine, which is currently used for treatment, and the endocrine and organic phosphorus preparations for this disease, such as "Arolsen" AROLSEN, are highly recommended by medical experts. According to clinical experience, if this medicine is taken in appropriate amounts and the patient strictly follows health regulations, the results will be perfect. (Arolsen is sold at Renshou Western Pharmacy, 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, French Concession, this city. Each box costs one yuan and fifty cents. - Editor.)</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>The Usefulness of Firecrackers</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>According to reports, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Liuyang County Firecracker Industry Association in Hunan, appealing for the abolition of the special firecracker tax. The letter from the Liuyang County Firecracker Industry Association stated four reasons for abolishing the special tax. After reading, I discovered that firecrackers actually have "unexpected uses," which was beyond my expectations. Now I am extracting it here:</p>
<p>...According to the Fujian Minbao, the Fujian Provincial Government meeting decided to increase the superstition special tax, including a firecracker item, and planned a tax rate of 30%... It has been found that firecrackers are by no means superstitious items. The former Hankou Firecracker Industry Association had previously presented the National Government's former Ministry of Health for chemical testing, and it was determined to be a sanitary product. This item is not only for the needs of weddings, funerals and sacrifices, but also to get rid of the smoke, making people feel clear-headed. It is truly beneficial to human health. It is a big mistake to call it a superstitious item...</p>
<p>Here, we will not care about (we can't care about) the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of poor farmers, industry and businessmen in Liuyang County who rely on this handicraft product for their livelihood, nor will we ask about the local ruling authorities' "arbitrary heavy taxes": however, from this, the huge use of firecrackers has been discovered, and it is felt that it is "unexpected"!</p>
<p>Generally speaking, what we know and can see is that in addition to "not only for the needs of weddings, funerals and sacrifices", when ordinary men and women want to worship heaven and thank the earth, and during the New Year and festivals, firecrackers are also indispensable. In addition, when the masses welcome a celebrity or important person to a wharf or station, and when there is good news in the war (like the night of the "January 28th" Shanghai battle last time), when a ball game wins, firecrackers are also used by one type of person. However, in addition to expressing respect and celebration, in today's society, which is full of grievances and widespread panic under the "economic depression", we can only "mistakenly" feel that these "yellow whips" and "skyrockets" are miserably and resentfully shouting "forced, forcing the poor, scared..." in the flying paper and sulfur atmosphere! And this deafening scream, this unpleasant stench, is said to "eliminate smoke and fog, make people feel clear-headed", and even that it is "very beneficial to human health". In this way, even if it is not "a big mistake", it feels a little "unsatisfactory"!</p>
<p>However, today, in this world, there are many things that can be "thought-provoking". However, when you find the "taste", it will make you "silently laugh". The appearance is really "impressive", but in fact, the inside is just a bag of straw - the so-called "gilded lilies" - it seems "plausible", but when broken, it is "nothing more than that". What watermelon seeds and peanuts are called "kings", and stinky tofu curds are indeed advertised as "hygienic"; students invented (?) "scientific altars"; fortune tellers can call themselves "philosophical masters"... even clown-like jokes are holding up the "humor" card; it is clearly an imperialist invasion, but they are taking "friendship", "promotion", "East Asian peace" and "instilling civilization" as a guise.</p>
<p>Originally, our society is generally performing many self-deceiving, profit-inducing, intimidating, etc. Jialin's tricks. Therefore, it is no coincidence that firecrackers, which have been proven by the Ministry of Health to be toxin-free and designated as "sanitary products", have become "medical products" and "stimulants" that are "very beneficial to human health".</p>
<h3>Riguan Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Small Records of Rural Travel</p>
<p>If outsiders come to our county seat and want to take a trip, the local leaders will definitely tell them without hesitation: the Confucius Temple outside the East Gate and the Riguan Teahouse outside the West Gate. The Confucius Temple is three miles outside the East Gate, and nearby is a cemetery. Among the overgrown weeds and solitary mounds, the Confucius Temple shows its dignity with its magnificent red walls under the setting sun. So even if there is no idol of Confucius, it can also be used as a picturesque scenic spot for visitors to linger. But it is puzzling that the Riguan Teahouse is listed as a famous site in the county alongside the Confucius Temple. It's a long story!</p>
<p>First: The Riguan Teahouse has been rebuilt into a Western-style house with a middle school after the fire. On the day of its reopening, it sold out for more than ten days because of the boast of the Western-style house. Whether in the same industry or in various transactions, it has always maintained the county's highest sales record. Until now, the Riguan Teahouse's business has always been dominant among its peers. Second: Believe it or not, the Riguan Teahouse is a three-story building! This is not because the residents of the county are short-sighted, what is so amazing about a three-story building? In fact, public institutions in the county, such as the county government, the Public Security Bureau, and even the richest tycoons in the county, such as the so-called millionaires Zhang, do not have houses exceeding two stories; isn't this the prestige of the Riguan Teahouse? The newly built three-story Western-style building!</p>
<p>Knowing this, then when you come to this city to travel, you must admire this three-story Riguan Teahouse. It is one of the two major scenic spots in the county, along with the Confucius Temple. There is also a history behind it!</p>
<p>Although I went to the Riguan Teahouse with my grandfather to eat sweets when I was five or six years old, and I still go there occasionally when I return to my hometown, I have heard this history countless times. But everyone has their own opinion, and since there is no county record to verify it, it is better to treat it as a myth. In short, in the Qing Dynasty, or even in the Ming Dynasty, an imperial envoy passed through this city, and he disguised himself and went to this teahouse to sip tea. When he sat until dusk, the golden light of the setting sun hanging on the city's walls shone brightly on the teahouse. Perhaps inspired by the Riguan Peak of Mount Tai, the imperial envoy thought that watching the sunrise from this teahouse would also be a beautiful scene, so he took out a pen from his bag and named it Riguan Teahouse. And he was inspired to write a poem, and then left. The next day, the gentry of the county knew about this, but the imperial envoy had already sailed away overnight. So they spent money to put the four characters "Riguan Teahouse" on a plaque, and the poem was also framed and hung above the plaque. I didn't pay attention to what the poem said when I was a child, and when I wanted to pay attention, the Riguan Teahouse suffered a fire. The plaque in the three-story Western-style house now is not the original.</p>
<p>The tea on the second floor of the Riguan Teahouse is divided into three prices. The bottom floor is for vendors and footmen to trade and rest, and a pot of fragrant tea costs ten cents. The second floor is where elementary school teachers and shop clerks and other shirt-wearing classes gather, and the price is doubled. The third floor can be called the mandarin jacket class. Although there are also fashionable young people in suits and leather shoes now, those who are not the top people in the county are not qualified to step on the third floor. The furnishings on the upper floor are also superior to all other teahouses: along the four walls are redwood kang beds, separated by tables, with seasonal flowers on the tables, and padded cushions in winter and straw mats in summer on the kang beds, so it is extremely comfortable to lie down and sip tea and chat. Even the central tea seats are red wooden tables with marble tops, and each table has four rattan chairs for playing small mahjong and playing Go. A pot of fragrant tea costs one dime, which is the highest price among the county's peers. If the imperial envoy could live a long life, he probably wouldn't have the mood to inscribe a name and write a poem if he revisited the teahouse today.</p>
<p>This time I traveled to the countryside for ten days, and because I was forced by public and private affairs, I couldn't find any free time to go to the Riguan Teahouse to admire the new scenery. My family told me that quarrels and fights often occur in the Riguan Teahouse (naturally referring to the third floor), because the teahouse waiter is scheming, and those tea customers want to play new tricks. At night, there are usually singing groups, Suzhou opera, and Ming opera and other roaming theater troupes performing new tricks there, which makes the gentlemen and young masters of the mandarin jacket class uneasy, and leads to disgraceful acts of quarreling and fighting.</p>
<p>I think that the reputation of the Riguan Teahouse may exceed that of the Confucius Temple with its towering walls. Perhaps there will be a day when the local leaders will tell outsiders that the county's only scenic spot is the Riguan Teahouse, that newly built three-story Western-style building.</p>
<h3>Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>I was jolted awake by the alarm clock at eight o'clock. My secret wish from last night—to sleep soundly—ultimately failed because I'm not used to it. Subconsciously, I wound the alarm clock fully before going to bed. I craned my neck out from under the covers and glanced at the dim window, thinking of turning over and going back to sleep, but my wife brought in a basin of water. She gets up half an hour earlier than I do every day to prepare my breakfast. Hearing the alarm, she comes in to wake me. For years, she's been like a machine, never changing. But from today onward, I no longer need to get up at eight o'clock. I can sleep whenever I want. However, my wife doesn't know yet, and I'm unwilling to disrupt the order of the family with this unfortunate news, even though it will inevitably be exposed one day. I quickly got out of bed, washed up, ate breakfast, and left the house with my briefcase.</p>
<p>Outside the door, heavy fog hung in the air, like a stone weighing down my heart, making me lose my sense of direction. I stood at the entrance of the alley, debating with myself: Where should I go? And where could I stay for the whole day? I slowly walked to the tram stop and encountered a colleague from work—no, I should say a friend now. "Where are you going?" he asked me—a question I couldn't answer myself. At work, we had the best relationship, and he wouldn't make fun of me for losing my job, but I instinctively felt it was an arrow, insulting me. I glared at him, answering as if scolding a subordinate: "Hmph! There's no food to eat here; there are plenty of places to eat!" My friend didn't get angry; he gripped my hand tightly: "Congratulations! I'll come visit you in a day or two…" He jumped onto the tram that was pulling into the station and left.</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>I felt a little relieved. I was glad I had that courage. But he's my friend. If it had been that foreign devil who yelled "Pig, get out!" yesterday, how much more self-satisfied I would be!</p>
<p>Tram after tram passed by, and the people at the station gradually thinned out. The newspaper boy looked at me strangely, wondering if he knew I had nowhere to go today. I still bought a newspaper from him. While he was peddling to others, I slipped away. I hurriedly walked a bit, and the thick fog had dissipated. I saw the standard clock on the post; it was already ten past nine. The question pressed me relentlessly again. If I encountered my friend again at this time, would I still have the courage to answer him that way? Thinking like this, I retreated into a quiet street, walking along the wall like a thief, with my head lowered, not daring to look ahead. I was afraid of seeing people's eyes! Passing the entrance of the park, I stopped. This was a free world, where I could stay for the whole day. So I turned in, found a quiet corner, faced the sun, and unfolded the newspaper to read. One page, two pages, three pages, four pages, supplements, advertisements—those advertisements had bloody words. I felt tired. I looked up at the sky. The sun wasn't overhead yet. Isn't just sitting here being foolish? Today this body should be a little free. The park has a very good early winter scene! I stood up and walked along the pond, like those gentlemen in leather coats, leaning on their canes, slowly, as if I were a painter or a poet, leisurely searching for materials for painting or poetry. I walked across the lawn, turned around the winding path, circled around the thatched pavilion, and returned to the pond again. Doing this once or twice, I felt like I was stuck in some kind of trap, with no way out. Looking at the shadow under my feet gradually shrinking, and feeling hungry, I came out and pushed open the glass door of a Russian restaurant.</p>
<p>The owner, with a big belly, welcomed me with a smile. Today he should be my confidant. His eyes weren't as fierce as other people's, squinting almost into a line. But wouldn't it be better if he had no eyes?</p>
<p>I ordered some strong Russian wine, ate a hearty meal, and was sent back to the quiet street. Then the problem of "the whole day" became "half a day," but even half a day takes half a day to pass. Time flies like an arrow. I suddenly recited this famous sentence I had learned since elementary school and laughed to myself, inexplicably.</p>
<p>Turning around three streets, I forgot if I had turned a corner, and how I arrived again at the entrance of the park. Naturally, I turned in again. At this time, there was no one in the park. I found the iron chair where I had sat in the morning and unfolded the newspaper to read again, sniffing through every telegram and news item like a newspaper editor. In the corner of the fifth page, I discovered a big secret: "A certain large and reputable insurance company is recruiting clerks and typists." I cursed "Pig, bastard!" How come I didn't see this secret when I flipped through the newspaper for half the morning? Excitedly, I cut out this secret with a small knife and hid it in my coat pocket. "Hmph! There's no food to eat here; there are plenty of places to eat!" Thinking this, I hoped my friend would come visit me tomorrow night. I threw the newspaper into the pond and walked out of the park, preparing to spend a few cents to see a movie at a small cinema. Today should be a little free!</p>
<p>I returned home at six o'clock, half an hour later than usual. My wife asked if I was busy at work? I didn't answer, holding the evening paper to block my face, silently reciting the address of the insurance company.</p>
<h3>Singing the News</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>The autumn evenings in the countryside are lonely.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a gust of desolate autumn wind lightly climbs over the roof ridge, causing a few withered leaves in the tile crevices to roll and rustle.</p>
<p>After dinner, everyone, as usual, has to think of some entertainment to pass the long dusk; but tonight, that entertainment has become a problem. Everyone is anxiously wondering in their hearts, gathering around a kerosene lamp, talking about some boring trivialities. The dim yellow light shines on the gray, dim, and bare walls, painting many vague outlines of our shadows on the wall.</p>
<p>The surroundings are quiet and solemn. Even the squeaking sound of a mouse crawling on the roof beams can be heard very clearly—(To be continued)</p>

<p>Young and handsome, speaking of Xue Ke. Kind and generous, with a gentle nature. Sitting in the room with sparse stars and a bright moon. At that moment. Reading late into the night, filled with many emotions. Because he. Is a passionate seed, filled with complaints. Holding a pen, reciting poetry lacks interest. Searching his dried-up intestines to find sentences. Suddenly. Pushing the door open and entering</p>

<p>is the beautiful Meie. It turns out. The eldest brother's favored personal maid. Named Douchan, like a charming fox. Full of spring breeze and affectionate glances. With an elegant figure and captivating eyes. Light and frivolous to the bone, revealing charm. Heavily painted with makeup, like a lotus emerging from the water. Carrying four plates of fresh fruit in her hands. Holding a silver pot of pure wine. Second Master. A small token of respect, the wine and fruit. Our Madam personally arranged it. Ordering the little maid. To personally deliver it for a long night. Xue Ke hurriedly stood up. Repeatedly saying, "I dare not." It's kind of you to move your lotus steps. And Madam has spent much effort. Baochan said. Between sister-in-law and brother-in-law, there's no need for formality. Madam said. Second Master, you put in the effort to save my brother. We depend entirely on you. Afraid that people in the house will know. Bring it over at night, and it won't matter. I am here as a maid. Tonight. There is a servant to attend to you in the room. After speaking, she cast affectionate glances. That Xue Ke. Doesn't understand this subtle scheme. Facing each other, reluctantly enduring. Baochan said. Don't let Madam hold her grudge. Later on. Clearing up the plates and setting them on the table. Jinlian hurried away like a shuttle. Turning her head and smiling as she left the room. Saying. Madam is personally shadowing you, you're not alone. Xue Ke's face flushed red.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Scenic Spots of Three Wu"</p>
<p>Flourishing and serene, speaking of Suzhou. Outside the city, Tiger Hill is considered a scenic spot. Lingyan and Tianping are filled with ancient sites. It is said that Emperor Qianlong toured the south and also visited. The scenery of Shi Lake is originally like a painting. Not letting West Lake monopolize the beauty. Having just passed Mid-Autumn, going to Lengjia. The clear waves reflect the moon, rowing a small boat. Going west, the mountains and forests are deep and secluded. The misty clouds are endless. Hanshan and Shide left traces of immortals. Only for the sake of the secluded scenery of the Three Wu. Don't say that the western suburbs have many beautiful scenes. It's just that. The prosperity in the city is also unparalleled. Shops are lined up one after another. Selling all kinds of goods at any time. Seeing friends. Going to banquets. Coming and going incessantly like a river. With a clanging sound, they speed away. Dazzling new cars don't stop. In summer, silk garments are as thin as cicada wings. In cold weather, sable coats and fox furs are worn. Competing in new clothes. Walking down the street. Suddenly encountering each other, they pause and stare. The most difficult thing to obtain. Is the Wu people's naturally soft voices. Entering the ears, they can dispel ten thousand sorrows. How many lifetimes of cultivation to be in the land of Gusu. Living in this paradise is better than being a millionaire. Why bother to be busy as a horse or ox all day long.</p>

<h3>Guotai Presents "A Midsummer Night's Dream"</h3>
<p>Inspection Committee Permits Public Screening, Movie Fans' Eyes Are Blessed</p>
<p>Warner Pictures, an authority in the American film industry, after more than two years of careful preparation and spending 1.5 million yuan of capital, exhausted the efforts of thousands of people, brought Shakespeare's great poetic drama "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to the screen. They also invited the world-renowned stage director Reinhardt to direct the film. He is the teacher of famous director Lubitsch and famous actor Emil Jannings. His artistic skill is highly admired. All the actors in the film were carefully selected by Reinhardt and were able to fulfill their roles satisfactorily. No wonder that after the film was completed, it caused a sensation when it was publicly screened in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>When the film was shipped to China, the Inspection Committee was very cautious when passing the film because the content had bizarre and fantastical deities. The license issued to Warner for the screening of the film had an additional note attached, which read as follows: "The film 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' is based on a famous work by the great writer Shakespeare. It is now made into a film by Warner First National Pictures Company of America. It is humorous, magnificent, and can be called an excellent structure. Although the content of the plot is full of illusions and wonders, it cannot be compared with other supernatural films. In order to preserve the artistic value of the film, special permission is granted for its screening."</p>
<p>This film is scheduled to be presented at the Guotai Grand Theater starting tonight (Friday). Movie fans in Shanghai will finally see this great and unparalleled masterpiece, and their eyes are truly blessed. The picture shows the fairy king, fairy queen, fairies, and monsters in the film.</p>
<h3>"The Dark Angel" Public Screening</h3>
<p>"The Dark Angel" is a rare, touching, and romantic masterpiece produced by United Artists in recent years. The plot is based on a golden dream of three little angels, who later misunderstand each other and sacrifice themselves for each other after they grow up. The film is extremely sad and charming. Without the combined efforts of the three great artists, Fredric March, the silver screen genius of "Resurrection" and "Les Misérables," Merle Oberon, the beauty of "The Scarlet Pimpernel," and Herbert Marshall, the new co-star of Greta Garbo, "The Dark Angel" could not have achieved such a victory. However, the contribution of director Sidney Franklin (director of "Waterloo Bridge" and "Smilin' Through") cannot be ignored. Therefore, it goes without saying that this film will win the praise and admiration of the ladies of Shanghai and the romantics of the world. It is now publicly screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater. The picture shows the male and female protagonists.</p>
