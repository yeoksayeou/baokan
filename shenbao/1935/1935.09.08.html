<p>— 秉</p>
<p>今日言普及敎育恒以識字。為先務於是從事編撰者。就統計以知常用之字更據常用之字以編「千字課」等書本藉供應用。從事實踐者則廣為推蕩號召。不識字運動從而職字之學。校盈於城中問字之學。生徧及女傭是誠盛事孰不讀歎。</p>
<p>夫識字者係。憑藉之手段非終極之目。的目的維何假徑於。文字以取得種種之新知改善。生活之技。能也苟此一前提為大衆。所公認則已往之方術。猶有商榷之餘地敢陳所見以質。當仳之敎育家。</p>
<p>我國語言文字在。古昔為一音一字而一。義厥後生活繁複語言文。字從而演進一義之表。達往往需二音二字。降及今日且置出之。於口之語言第言筆之於紙之文字無。論其體制為文言為白話尤多。複字成義試觀我文不曰「憑」而曰。「憑藉」不曰「終」而曰「終極」其在。白話「石」字不足必曰「石頭」「時」字不足必。曰「時候」文法家訂立名稱弗。拘單字複字凡自成一義者統謂之詞而認詞。為語句之單位。</p>
<p>苟不忽視上述之事。實則就統計以知常用之字或。得一千或得二千實屬並非精密之。方術蓋同一字也與他。字拚合而成各個複字之詞其義往往逈乎不。同今不顧詞之為何惟計其字。之出現次數視共多寡而决共為常川為罕見豈得謂。之精密如「委託」與「原委」顯係毫不相關之二。詞然祇觀單字則「委」字出現二。次矣又如「風字「馬」字「牛」字皆習見。之名詞其為常用殆無疑義然合而言。之曰「風馬牛」共出。現次數寗得與習見之「風馬」「牛」併計耶卽此二例意。已茶明所謂常用字彙乃。非至可憑信之物據之以編書本。難免顧此失彼之弊此必需省悟者也。</p>
<p>然統計究屬可貴。第須用之得當耳倘拾字而言詞。取普通書報多種逐句分析以觀何。詞為常用何詞為罕見其結果卽得一常。用詞彙據此常用詞彙以編書本自能使學者熟。諳詞之義蘊與用途閱讀寫作。兩蒙其便假令「委託」與「原委」俱。為常用必然二者並習無或拋。荒一轉移之問而功效大異所情就往績以觀多數。人尙未注意及此茲特提出期共改轍。</p>
<p>旣確定。常用詞彙矣若施敎之目的。偏重於授與學者以此常用詞彙則成果依然有限已。往「千字課」等書本固偏重於文字之傳。授者其編制以嵌字為要趣味枯燥每弗遑。顧嘗聞職字學校之學生因。讀書味同嚼蠟有不終業而輟學者矣。共勉自强制得終其業者是。否永與文字為綠。隨時閱讀書報以為益知修能之資亦。屬疑問以意度之識字讀書旣弗。覺其甘旨惟有漸與疎闊終至返於不。識不讀之本初耳以故施敎之敎材必須。以引起閱讀興趣養成閱　習慣為至。要此點旣已認淸而後以常用詞。彙表達之方為接近理想之書本普及敎育之恩物。</p>
<p>識字學生讀畢課本。卒業離校欲憑藉其新獲之工。具以期益知修能將何所閱讀耶必曰有。種種之民衆讀物在然我嘗觀坊間。刋行之民衆讀物矣共編撰之態度每多未合編。者似謂飢者易為食渴者易為飲。纔識若干文字之輩情同於飢者渴者。初不必餉以珍味甘泉任。取粗經混水與之巳遠勝於無矣殊不知知能惟。求其裨益人生而享有知。能絕無階級之差別彼輩夙不識字獲。得知能之途閉塞其。一誠為苦事今旣議。字矣自當嘗味精品擴其新生以故民衆讀物。之編撰宜與專門著述同其審愼凡。一般人所急欲接近之諸科目皆當取最精。確最完備之材料編成書本以應。衆之需求其文字方面之必需注意者。卽凡所寫述俱以常用詞彙為據。庶幾讀者罔所扞格閱讀有左右逢源之樂一。方又宜編撰辭典其釋解所用悉不。出當用詞彙之範圍俾識字學生得此。辭典卽可閱讀一般書報而不限。於特編者至此則識字敎育之全功已竟普及敎育。之目的始達。</p>
<p>總之徒令識字。意義甚少必令熱習常用諸詞又。必於來學者之閱讀興趣習慣加以注。意而後彼輩識字可以應用閱讀不成苦。趣最終又必為彼輩佈置適宜之。環境俾得應用其新獲之工具以益知修能且。將終身以之若飲食之弗能或缺方今掃。除文盲呼聲盈耳識字立校各地都有主持。其事者苟於我言少加措意編書施敎。咸求更進一步成績或尤有可觀乎。</p>

<p>（巴黎）羅馬對於國聯行政院所委任之五人特別委員會之努力、頗為悲觀、巴黎現正計議由英法意三國舉行新會議以代之之計劃、據恊和報載稱、新會議或將仍在斯特萊柴舉行、本年四月間三國曾於德國重整軍備後在該地開會、商妥擬在歐洲進行之政策、該報又稱、如目前之計劃、能成事實、則墨索里尼願英國以鮑爾溫及霍爾為代表、法國以賴伐爾為代表、巴黎觀察者之意見、意阿爭議或可覔得人種解决辦法、許意大利在阿比西尼亞佔有一種地位、如英國在伊拉克然、意國謂實行阿國之警政與行政事務、而阿國仍為國聯會員國、或謂墨索里尼旣派大軍前赴東非、可用以征服拒絕贊同此種解决辦法之邊界各省、庶免大軍之空出云、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）政界人士、對於阿比西尼亞事件、並未拋棄解决之希望、但以為目前有日內瓦所討論之各項計劃、則不能加以接受、最後解决之希望、在於關係各國間之非正式談話、蓋此種非正式談話、往往能收實效、此則固為一般人所承認者也、目前主要癥結、乃在於至目前為止所提出各項建議所根據之原則、其中有一原則、主張由英法意三國連同阿比西尼亞、共同訂結條約、以謀澈底解决、然意國政界人士、則以為此種原則、倘加以同意則較諸一九〇六年三國條約、將更退一步、蓋一九〇六年三國條約、劃定英法意三國在阿比西尼亞之勢力、而事前則並未與阿國磋商、今乃欲使阿比西尼亞與英法意三國共同訂約、自難為意國所接受、此外政界人士表示、意國所要求者、乃管轄阿比西尼亞全境、與英國管轄菲洲委任統治地坦噶尼喀之情形相同、惟此層至目前為止、亦未為各方所接受、然無論如何、在國聯會機構以外、成立恊定之可能、則仍未消失、一般入並以為倘由關係各國外部負責人員直接折衝、或較易於成立恊定、意國兼外長墨索里尼法國兼外長賴伐爾、英國外相霍爾、倘能聚首一堂、則於本問題之解決、自有許多便利、因此政界人士咸以為斯德萊柴會議之方式、不妨再行採用云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　　帝國海外各自治領、對於意國進攻阿比西尼亞時、實施制裁之一事、有何種反響、極　官方所關切、尤其是最近南菲聯邦首都柏萊多里亞商會、通過决議案、請求政府保障菲洲領土之現狀、英國政府乃尤為注意、就目前情形、英國各自治領態度、大體可分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）加拿大　加拿大總理裴納特最近曾宣言、加拿大政府之責任、在於阻止加拿大勿令捲入國際糾紛之漩渦、然裴納特此種宣言、未必有何效力、蓋加拿大保守黨現政府、不久恐將顛覆、而自由黨領袖李金齊之主張、　滴與裴納特相反、至加拿大一般與論、　對於實施制裁、增强國聯會盟約効力、似並不反對、</p>
<p>（二）澳洲　澳洲與論、對於意阿問題、意見不若具　各自治領之分歧、澳洲政府保守黨總理里翁與社會黨前總理蘭格均反對制裁、但澳洲內閣、則於最近决　、儘可能限度　護英政府之日內瓦政策、此外澳洲與論、大抵贊成維持國聯會盟約之效力、但不贊成實施制裁、則以恐引起戰爭故也、</p>
<p>（三）南菲聯邦　南菲聯邦三州、均完全贊成嚴格實施國聯會盟約條文、其理由有三、一則恐引起菲洲之人種衝突、蓋菲洲有色人種與白人之衝突、煞費苦心、始克消滅、目前不應令其死恢復燃也、二則因南菲人士相信、屢行國際義務、道德上關係甚為重要、三則因南菲勞工階級反法西斯之示威、最近南菲碼頭工人舉行罷工拒絕肉類裝船運往東菲、供給意國軍隊、卽其一例也、</p>
<p>（四）南維持西亞與紐絲綸　此兩地則不問英國政策若何、始終加以贊助、</p>
<p>由是可見英國各自治領態度、頗多暌異、但英國政府大約將單獨行動、對於各自治令之意見、將不加以考慮、則以意阿爭端、關係歐洲較為重要而於英帝國全部殊少干係故也、（七日哈斯瓦社電）</p>

<p>法租界金神父路打浦坊八號、二房東南匯人蔣金梅及其妾周浦婦人汪阿妹兩人、突然慘死於臥室中、至昨晨七時許始經發現、二人頭部均被砍斷、僅頸部連帶微皮、厥狀殊慘、最可異者、卽兩人於夜間被害時、同居者竟毫無所聞、究屬被人殺害、或係出於自殺、現捕房方面尙未能决定、總之奉離奇、情形突兀、茲將詳情、探錄於后、</p>
<p>離婚再娶</p>
<p>蔣金梅浦東南淮縣人、現年三十七歲、向在本埠專門承包各荳腐渣滓、然後再售與鄉人餵飼猪仔、前娶同鄉胡氏女爲室、育一女名秀珍、芳齡十五、嗣因夫婦間發生意見、經於二十一年間雙方協讀離異、迨後蔣乃復娶松江少婦李氏爲繼室、迄已三載、李氏並無所出、遂螟蛤一子、取名根林、年甫三歲、</p>
<p>繼續納妾</p>
<p>蔣在　年前頂賃法租界金神父路打浦橋堍打浦坊八號單幢三層樓住房一所、除蔣與李氏及蔣之父母蔣咸海·蔣儲氏曁子女同居外，餘屋卽圍租於三記客、詎至去年科間、蔣又與同行同住房客周浦婦人汪丁氏之女汪阿（今年十八歲）發生同居之愛、旋於今年廢歷二月中旬、蔣乃正式納阿妹爲妾、兩人卽將二樓前房作臥室、</p>
<p>妻妾失和</p>
<p>當時續娶之李氏卽帶領子女以樓下後客堂爲臥室、蔣之父母卽僱用之車夫六七人、暫住於前客堂、均早摺晚舖、習以爲常、蔣處妻妾之、表面上雖平等待遇、但實際上對於阿際方面、不無偏寵、因是妻妾兩人、情感日劣、且時有爭吵、蔣雖從中百般敷衍、李氏終悻悻於懷、阿妹之母汪丁氏自女實行嫁蔣後、因感覺諸多不安、於四月間卽遷出另住於華界日暉港日暉路五安坊二十四號、</p>
<p>不見下樓</p>
<p>阿妹自下嫁蔣後、卽懷身孕、已將八月、產期彌近、前日（六日）下午六時許、妻妾間又起齟齬、惟片刻卽止、至七時許、蔣偕阿妹上樓就寢、蔣之父母與李氏子女等待客堂內夥友等共叉麻雀停歇、已至九時、旋卽各自安睡、詎至昨晨七時左右、樓下諸人俱已起身久尙未見蔣與阿妹二人下樓、當時李氏卽命女秀珍上樓叫喚、</p>
<p>滿染血跡</p>
<p>秀珍上樓屢喚無應、旣而頻叩房門、仍然闑焉無聞、乃托住在二樓亭子間鄰居同鄉人朱蔣氏往喚、良久仍無回答、至是乃起疑寶、秀珍乃猛力推門、奈房門上乃係司勃林鎖鍵、室外無法開啟、急取扶梯爬上板壁從上端牛眼方格、再向內窺視、祇見床帳地板、滿染血跡、醒惡難聞、不禁大駭、氏遂由蔣母儲氏、報告盧家灣中央捕房、</p>
<p>斷頭鴛鴦</p>
<p>捕房由西探長佛郎登·督察長培爾奇·華督察員金九林·探目張子楹·周步廣等、赶往將房門踢開、入內察看、見蔣汪氏全身赤裸、仰臥床上、頸項間被用刀砍斷約三分之二、外傳肚腹被部開不確、蔣金梅俯仆窗口邊地板上、一脚跨入脚桶內、脚桶傍遺有近尺長闊約二寸之尖刀兇器一柄、蔣之頸項間割斷三分之一、赤膊赤脚、身穿白洋布短褲、兩尸皆滿身血汚、床上及蚊帳與地板上、亦染滿身血跡、探等向屋內上下居住之人查詢、均稱隔夜通宵寂靜無響聲、殊屬奇異、</p>
<p>法院檢騐</p>
<p>旋又在床前粧台抽屜內檢得死者蔣金梅遺書數封內叙、其自殺原因、惟訊之家屬則謂死者生前、不能執筆寫字、經中西探詳細察勘後、將其屋內所住家屬人等、帶至捕房偵訊、并派探吳文綱駐守於死者家內、一面派探張春勝通知同仁輔元分堂、飭派堂夫前往、將尸體舁入騐尸所、報請特二法院、委派王任檢察官、於下午三點半時偕總法醫彭瑚、記官等蒞所、如法詳細檢騐尸體一過、升坐公案、</p>
<p>形似自殺</p>
<p>據包探張春勝報告調查情形云、據捕房方面研究其情况、似係死者蔣金海先殺死其妾後，又自殺死等語、官據以訊問死者父母妻女蔣咸海·蔣儲氏·蔣李氏·蔣秀珍·證人朱蔣氏等、均供夜間未聞響聲動靜、不知如何被殺、並據蔣咸海請求段尸收殮、官遂諭騐得蔣金海蔣汪氏均係因刀傷身死、尸屬蔣咸海領殮、</p>

<p>秋高氣爽、正是健兒用武之時、昨日下午二時、本市出席全運會田徑選手補選、在交通大學舉行、參加運動員、雖僅五六十人、然精神煥發、男子項目中、戴淑國、以五十二秒正之成績、破四百公尺全國紀錄、（全國紀錄需劉長春之五十二秒四）、為大會之最佳收穫、女子項目中、則以錢行素之百公尺成績十三秒五、較為出色、</p>
<p>外來珍客</p>
<p>查此次本市出席全運田徑選手、早經决定、此項補選、係恐有遺漏之人材、並予未參加本市夏令訓練會者之一機會、昨日出席比賽之珍客、有前代表福建之林紹洲、　淑國、及山東姑娘朱天眞與丁桂梅、惟常熟小姐龐媛玉、雖曾報名、但未出席比賽、</p>
<p>競賽情形</p>
<p>昨日令人失望者、為張嘉　之跳遠及三級跳均未出席、僅賽百米即落選、　淑國在百米决賽中、屈居第四、旋在四百米中、一躍登極、自始至終、一貫步伐、將來全運會中、將為董淑昭之一勁敵、又林紹洲抱病登塲、聞此次患咳嗽甚烈、故於競賽時、未敢十分用力、致成績平平、又戴俊昌之八百米、成績二分八秒六、頗有可觀、若將來代表本市出席全運、或有第五六席之望、北餘男子成績、無一足述、</p>
<p>女子田徑</p>
<p>女子田徑賽中、小錢得五十米及百米兩第一、以百米成績較優、二百公尺、因無人參加、故無决賽、跳高朱天眞以一米二九得第一、鉛球丁桂梅得第一成績九米一四、將來亦可為本市爭得分數但施藕卿、昨因傷足、一籌莫展跳遠被陳再春壓倒、陣再春于跳遠、得四米八三、惜錢行素放棄此項、而龐小姐又未來、陳乃稱雄無敵矣、</p>
<p>全能運動</p>
<p>昨日五項有三人加入、十項只魏志平一人、成績平平、而魏志平於前半部未賽完、且因成績太劣、故今日之後半部、巳决定不再舉行、五項孫惠培得第一、成績二零五七分、係用全國運動會最近公佈之計分表記算、較舊計分法、稍覺吃虧</p>
<p>會塲拾零</p>
<p>戴淑國　不負衆望</p>
<p>四百公尺能手戴淑國、此次來滬效命、昨在預選會中初試脚頭、惹動許多迷哥前往參觀、戴計參加百公尺、一一百公尺、四百公尺三項、百公尺中預賽以十一秒八得第一、决賽中竟退居第四、觀衆大為掃興殊不知百公尺本非戴之拿手、二百公尺遂放棄參加、養精蓄銳、果然於四百公尺中顯出本領、一路領先、直達終點、以五十二秒破劉長春保持之五十二秒四全國紀錄、觀衆又歡笑不止、</p>
<p>林紹洲　扶病登塲</p>
<p>保持全國商　紀錄十六秒二之福建林紹洲、亦為觀衆矚目之一、詎林以十七秒五完成、雖然冠軍、然成績倒退、據林吿人渠感冒巳兩星期、來滬依然未愈、近來咳嗽加劇、扶病登塲、　兗脚力不健、且昨日北鳳甚大、逆風而跑、亦足影戀成績、一俟休　數日、仍可恢復巳往紀錄也、</p>
<p>龐媛玉　芳影杏然</p>
<p>龐小姐為常熱人、具跳遠成績曾在蘇省區運動會中、破全省紀綠、本學期來滬就讀於東亞（一說愛國）亦報名參加本市預選會、滬上迷哥、俱欲一覩常熟小小組之風采、然不料以生理關係、昨日不能參加、故　覓塲中、別影查然矣、</p>
<p>朱天眞　成績退步</p>
<p>山東小姐朱天眞、為保持全國女子跳高紀錄之名將也、昨亦參加、以久疏練習、腿灣生硬、至一公尺二九時、經四次始能眺過、離原有之一公尺三五五成績相差太遠、期第二名牛再為一公尺廿三、第三名楊鶯為一公尺二〇、</p>
<p>陳再春　跳得不錯</p>
<p>女子跳遠陳再春、昨得四公尺八三、與李森之成績相等、離全運紀錄四公尺八八相差無幾、稍加練習、不難打破、施藕卿本在萬國運動會中出人頭地、昨跳至四公尺三五時忽碰傷脚骨、不能再跳、致居第三、同時預定參加之百公尺及跳高亦中止而去、</p>
<p>錢行素　愈跑愈快</p>
<p>錢行素小姐巳保持二百公尺、低欄、跳遠三項全國紀錄、昨又參加五十公尺、百公尺兩項、五十公尺成續七秒四、百公尺成績十三秒五、離全國紀錄均不遠、此次參加全運、或將放棄跳遠、改為百公尺亦未可知、</p>
<p>萬公尺　祇到二人</p>
<p>一萬公尺參加者十四人、老將萬金生以及周如泉等均參加、惟跑至中途、氣力不支而退、錢增龍本有奪標希望、至十五圈時、老病復發、只得退出、終其程者僅凌學文飽毅弼二人而巳、</p>

<p>（一）最好每一級成一集團‘，五六年級成二集團，合成一會。人數至多六十人，每十人為一隊。</p>
<p>（二）每隊有隊長二人，一正一副。</p>
<p>（三）每星期舉行一次隊長會議，每月開一次全體大會。</p>
<p>（四）會員會費每人小洋二角，作購買器械書籍之用。</p>
<p>（五）不論一草一木，如果有疑難的地方，互相請敎。最後可派代表請問先生們，必至明暸透徹方休。</p>
<p>（六）那一隊報告詳細正確，那一隊研究徹底，得由各隊長聯席評判，最優幾隊，且購獎品鼓勵之。好了，小朋友們大家起來組織吧！</p>
<h3 id="c171">雷轟電霹的國際風雲 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>戰爭的風雲已經雷電似地瀰漫著歐非兩洲之間了！小朋友們大家都看到聽到了罷。</p>
<p>意大利的領袖墨索里尼，他本早巳把東非洲的阿此西尼亞看作囊中之物。阿比西尼亞本是東非一個半開化的黑種干國，白種人大家覬覦著的一塊未被處分的大肥肉，在國際舞台上，阿國是一個無名小卒，他怎麽敢和那彪形大漢的一等白種種强國意大利相抗呢？他自然是氣上不服，寗爲玉碎。他渴望著孔武有力的英美來替他保鑣。你看戰爭尙未揭幕，便把唯一賓庫面積逾全國一半的石油礦權出讓於英美方面的菲洲開拓公司了。英美為著要掩飾和平主張，便不得不因意大利的誌責而把這石油傳的占有權暫時放棄。然而意大利却依然是宣吿著要自由行動，不許國聯阻擋。</p>
<p>大英帝國是久執海上牛耳的覇王。意大利出兵，必須通過地中海紅海的要道：這些要道都是在英國海軍掌握之下的。</p>
<p>如今意國對於阿國彷彿是螳螂捕蟬。那蟬是落在螳螂掌下，而螳螂自身却又不能不顧忌到背後的黃雀，——英美。</p>
<p>英國表面上雖高唱著置身局外，力保和平。實際上却又在馬爾他島等處——地中海的要道——整肅著海軍陣容，不許輕易觸犯。你想戰禍一發，英國能不捲入漩渦嗎？英國一旦宣吿動員，便成了英意的正面交鋒，德，法，美，日等國，都有彼此牽帶的利害關係，於是戰爭的範圍便立刻擴大了。這不是第二世界大戰的序幕嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友們！如果西方大戰爆發，我們東亞又怎樣呢？我們須記取距今不到二十年，世界第一大戰的當兒，我們的芳鄰乘著機會對著我們活躍起來。這段故事，不妨去問問各人的老師。</p>
<p>現在第一次的大戰又要光臨了，東亞的風雲將連帶著如何變色？我們還能躱在搖籃裏做甜蜜的好夢嗎？</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>弄火是敏兒常玩的玩意，他時常把一根火柴的黑頭在火柴盒的黑面，他只要把六拇指　住那黑頭，稍稍的一撳，那黑等便燃燒起來，同時他很迅速的一放，於是那黑頭一面在跌下去，一面在燃燒，一天，他又在這樣的玩了，被他的哥哥看見。</p>
<p>「敏弟，你要知道這玩意是很危險的，一不留心便要把手指灼傷，一方面又白白的費了一根火柴，眞是可惜。』</p>
<p>『哥哥這有什麽可惜，一根火柴値多少錢呢？一匣火柴也不過一二枚銅元。」</p>
<p>「你不要看輕一根火柴，製造一根火柴，要許多手續和血汗哩，』</p>
<p>『製造一根火柴要多少手續呢？」</p>
<p>『舊法的製造火柴，木桿要用棉花做，這是更費手續和時問，所以現在的火柴桿是用白楊樹的樹枝做的。火柴本有兩種：一種叫紅頭火柴，另一種叫安全火柴。紅頭火柴很危險，因為容易燃燒，並且製造這種火柴的工人，時常中毒，因為紅頭火柴是黃磷做的，黃磷很毒，吃了百分之二十要使人致死的，所以被政府當局禁止了。現在我們看見的都是安全火柴。</p>
<p>要安全火柴的製造：一、把火柴梗的一頭先浸入一種引火的液體，像點火的臘燭油。二、再蘸於膠質，等它乾了，便成了火柴頭。這膠質是硫化弟和樹膠的混合液。二、盒面上是塗的紅磷，硫化梯玻璃粉和樹膠調和。這種火柴必須要在特製的盒面上摩擦，否則不會燃燒的。』</p>

<p>蝶，是節肢動物昆虫類。它的種類很多，大約有一百四十九種。四翅生得很美麗，頭上生着一對像鼓槌的觸角，腹部很小，被着很細的毛，沒有刺人的肉針，日間在花叢裏飛着，吸食各種的花汁，靜止的時候，四翅直豎起來在背脊上，它的蛹不做繭，用絲來掛在樹枝和墻壁上，它們都是值物害虫的一種呀！小朋友，請你看看左面的圖，例如各種的鳳蝶，大都是害菓樹的，粉蝶，大都是害蔬菜的。蛺蝶，環紋蝶，眼蝶，小灰蝶，弄蝶，大都是害草本和農產品的。你想；它對於植物這樣的殘害，對於我們有很大的害處。的確；還有你們捉它來玩玩和做標本的時候，一不小心，連眼睛也會給它弄壞了。因爲它們的翅有着很毒的粉，捉着它的時候，它努力掙扎，毒粉就飛散了，若果給它飛到眼睛裏，很容易把我們寳貴的眼睛弄壤呢！</p>

<p>因為我歡喜買書的緣故，所以我家裏有不少的兒童讀物。最近，接受雲兒的要求，把這些兒童讀物，捐給伊創辦一個小小的圖書館，並且還替伊買了兩隻書架，把這些書陳列起來。於是伊就聯合了十幾個同學，以及鄰居的女見們，一心一意的創辦起來。</p>
<p>小小圖書館的館址，是在一間小小的房間裏，裏面除了放兩隻書架以外，還有一張小桌子，和幾張小板凳，每天下午放了學回來，伊們就躱在那小屋子裏看書，有不懂的地方，或是不認識的字，伊們就來問我，我雖然覺得麻煩些，但是伊們的進步；倒是很快。</p>
<p>伊們這小小圖書館裏，除了逐日開放以外，也可以把書借出去看，伊們有一本小冊子，借書的人在這小冊子上寫下書名和自己的名字，就可以拿出去了！還的時候，就用筆塗掉。</p>
<p>照例，雲兒們每天有一角大洋的糖果錢，現在伊們把這筆錢省下來去買書，其餘小朋友們，也常把書捐給這小小圖書館裏，所以伊們的書，是日漸的增多。小朋友們！你們的爸爸有書嗎？如果有的話，你們也可以這樣去做啊！</p>

<p>鹿在全世界，有四十餘種，產於我國東北問東者，名關東鹿，其角與茸，非常珍貴，國藥中認為滋陰補陽的效力。鹿性馴良，毛依四季而變化，春季為赤褐色，斑紋很亦美麗，夏季為茶色，秋則　變為茶褐色，如變為焦茶色時，斑紋亦逐漸顯出，但牝鹿變為暗紫色時，斑紋愈不顯明。鹿在夏季，棲居深山，入冬移居山麓，晚秋楓葉映紅的時候，牡鹿時鳴求牝，當四五月問，在溪流旁邊草木茂盛地方產子。小鹿為赤褐色白斑。鹿屬於草食類，與麒麟相同，行走甚速，如遇害敵，牡必振角相向，牝以前脚蹴敵。鹿角每年二三月更換一次，好像一年生的草本，年年新陳代謝。小鹿的角，沒有短枝，大槪過了八年，有枝三根。春季初生角時，圓端包皮，稱為袋角，起初為赤褐色，漸漸變為黑色，角內密布血管，年齡漸長，袋角變為硬角，如發育完全，外為黑褐色的皮，好像樹的枝幹。角到了每年二月，因為要自然脫落，所以在未　落以前，預先把角鋸下，用以配藥雕刻器具，普通以十月底為鋸角最　當的期。但我國藥肆中所飼養的鹿，為採製鹿茸，未到時期，就要鋸下的。</p>

<p>小鼓手答道：「當然囉！你想還能免得了麽」？他懇切地說着，因為這是他第一次受傷，自己覺得很榮譽，不然，他在老大佐跟前向來是不敢開口的。</p>
<p>「那時我低着頭，沒命的跑，又時時蹲下身去，但那奧大利人早巳瞧見我了。他們要是不給我受傷的話，那我定可早到二十分鐘。幸而我撞見了總司令部一位大佐，我就將那信交給了他。然而我以後還是掙扎着想回來。我渴得要死，心中又在憂急，生怕耽誤了大事。我曾怒呌着，心想每一分鐘的遲緩，就足以送掉我們隊中一個人的性命。但是我巳盡了我的能力。我很滿足。可是大佐你瞧，你自己也正在流血呀！」</p>
<p>眞的，大佐那隻受傷的手，因為包紮不牢，血液正在從手掌上流下來。</p>
<p>小鼓手忙道「大佐，可要我給你將綳布縛得緊些麼？讓我來助你一下。」</p>
<p>老大佐把他那隻受傷的左手，給了小鼓手，一面仲出右手來幫助着抽緊那繩子的結；但那小鼓手剛從枕頭上撑起身來，臉色忽的泛成慘白，重又倒了下去。</p>
<p>老大佐瞧着他，連忙縮回了他的手道：「算了！算了！你自己當心着自己，不要管別人的事吧；要知你不當心輕微的傷，將來也許要不可收拾的。」</p>
<p>小鼓手搖搖他的頭。</p>
<p>老大佐很着意的對他瞧着，說道：「但你道般的軟弱，多分是失血太多了吧。」</p>
<p>小鼓手微笑道：「失　太多麽？比了血還要多一些哩。請瞧！」說着他將下身蓋着的被兒褐了開來。</p>
<p>老大佐猛吃一驚，退下了一步。</p>
<p>那孩子只只了一條腿；那左腿巳在膝蓋上面截去了。截斷的所在包着布，沾滿了血汚。</p>
<p>正在這時，有一個矮胖的軍醫走過這這裹。他指着小鼓手，向大佐說道：「呀！大佐，這是一件　不幸的事。這一條腿本來是可以保留的，只因用力太多，已在發炎，那就不得不截去了，但他勇敢得很，始終沒有流一滴淚，喊一聲痛。我在施行手術的時候，心中很是驕傲，以為他眞是我們意大利的孩子！委實說，他是英雄的種子呀！」說完，他自管走開去了。</p>
<p>老子佐皺緊了他那兩條粗粗的白眉，着小鼓手，一面把那被兒給他蓋上了。他不知不覺的伸起手來，將他的軍帽除下了。</p>
<p>小鼓手很驚異的喊道：「大佐！怎麼？你向我行禮麼」？</p>
<p>那粗豪的老軍人，他從來不向部下說一句溫柔的話的，這是卻柔聲下氣的說道：「我不過是一個大佐，你却是一位英雄！」說時，伸着兩臂，抑住了小鼓手，非常懇切的和他親了一吻。（完）</p>

<p>— 羅瓊</p>
<p>——關於婦女的裝飾問題——</p>
<p>在這世界經濟特　蕭條期間，國際貿易日益衰退，國內市塲極度縮小，已釀成了目前世界上最普遍而最嚴重的問題。但是就在這種經濟狀况之下，各國婦女消耗品的生產及消費量，却能別樹異　。如美國「裝鉓婦女們臉上和身上的金錢，仍繼續　經濟恐慌未來以前的那積豪勢—每星期三千萬元左右，每年一萬萬五千六百元，比較印度歲入兩倍多一點」（新中華三卷十五期Ａ.Hurley着化妝品和女性美）從「美國化妝品工業的生產來看，在這不景氣期間，各工業部門的生產規模無不縮小，而獨有化妝工業，未受一些影響」（引上雜誌），這非單徵實了美國國內婦女化妝品未見衰退，更說明了消受美國化彩品的國家最多的如歐洲各國，其容盡亦未見縮小。就把化妝品的消耗比較少的中國來講，在這經濟恐慌絕端嚴重的現在，據國定稅則委員會與新聞記者談話；「年份上半年單以香水脂粉，一項婦女消耗品輸入，共達國幣五十五萬八千七百七十元，較之上年同期，未見若何减落」（一九三五，八，三申報）。上述各國婦女化妝品的消費，未見减退，這是指絕　數値；倘對一般商品的比例而言，無疑的比去年或前年增加。</p>
<p>在這各國國際貿易一般衰落，人民購買力普遍縮小的現在，獨有婦女化妝品仍在相對地增加，這眞是値得注意的一個問題。所以對這問題引起了種種不同的解釋，而這許多不同解釋的歸結，都以為是由於婦女美化主義益形高漲。因此在道不景氣中，她們寗可緊縮其他消費，而不願减少身上的修飾，於是雪花膏白玉霜的製造者們，美容專家們，橡皮减重帶，體重按摩機的敗賣者們，下腹部應如何修養的著作者們，還是風起雲湧，繼續獲得她們的肥利。</p>
<p>這種解釋，在表面上看來，當然不無理由；可惜的是他只抓住了現象，而沒有看到的本質。婦女化妝品的相對增加，决不是靠婦女「天性愛美」和「美化主義特別高漲」這些心理的原因所能解釋，我們應該從各層婦女經濟生活的變遷上去尋取它的恭本原因，在這恐慌期間，一般人民的向兩極分化愈益顯著；一般所謂高等婦人，靠着她們老爺的資本的集中，利潤增加，她們對於化妝品的消費，當然仍可無限度地擴展。</p>
<p>更重要的是大批中下層的婦女，她們在這經濟緊縮，失業恐慌普遍期間，無法找到正常工作以維其簡單樸素的生活。勞動力旣無法出賣，於是不得不出賣婦女們的特種商品，從娼妓，舞女，按摩，招待，一直到花瓶，交際花，以至所聞「名媛」「閨秀」之類，通過多種多樣的方式，或明或暗地來出賣其肉體，造成了特別繁榮的人肉市塲。這種特種商品，亦如一般商品同樣，在恐慌期間，遭遇到劇烈的競爭，因此不得不用更美麗的裝璜，更巨大的廣吿，吸引顧客，以求脫售。這許多婦女們，亦就為獲得生活資料，不得不「墮入」傷風敗俗的頹廢生活之中，」用濃厚的脂粉，妖艷的服裝，盡量美化自身，以博得顧客們垂靑。所以她們「緊縮其他消費，不願减少面部修飾」是同勤苦農民寗可　着肚子，省下一點錢來買種子肥　是有同等意義。因爲不是這樣，就會連這一點「緊縮」的生活資料也會無從獲得的啊！</p>
<p>這裏很多易看到，婦女美化主義的高漲，婦女化妝品的生產及消費的相對增加，是婦女經濟生活兩極化的結果，是反映着極嚴重的經濟恐慌，隱藏着極慘酷極普遍的肉體買賣。所以婦女　裝艷服，完全是建築在現存經濟機構上面。如果我們以為婦女們的濃裝艷那，是由於一天性愛美　，或是愛慕虛榮，反來實　婦女，那非但沒有抓到問題的核心，反面掩飾了問題的嚴重的根源，我們反對婦女們的濃裝艷服；但是我們深信這種一傷風敗俗」的舉動不是婦女們自己的罪惡，而是不合理的社會制度所造成的必然的化物，在這制度之下，婦女們不但是任人宰割，而是「代人受過」的「羔羊」。</p>

<p>——一個濟良所所女的遭遇——</p>
<p>因一偶然的機會，得在日市一個濟良所裏住了幾天。得和許多所女閒談過。共中名愛花的，最為可憐。特略述如下：</p>
<p>據愛花的自白：九歲那一年的春天，父親去世，母親出去為人鄉傭，十一歲的哥哥，又在近村的窮家做放牛的工作，愛花被送給了鄰村一個被人稱為「雌老虎的女人家裏做了童養媳。她走進這個門兒，就開始過着打茶駡飯的牛馬生活！每天除燒飯洗衣之外，常被差到山野裏去揀雜柴。毒過咬傷了手臉：荊棘刺痛了皮　，歸來後，非但沒處訴說，有時還要因歸時太遲，或揀柴太少而被婆婆打駡或罰着餓肚子。她的丈夫，又是一個年巳十五而終日嘻戲的白痴，什麼事，都得愛花去服侍他。</p>
<p>這樣的生活，足足過了三年多，她巳漸知人事，感到被虐待的不能忍受，而這位白痴的丈夫，更使感到前途的渺茫。在一個秋雨之夜，她便悄悄地單　離開了這虎窟，這人間地獄，　　個兒走着走着，希望到了城市，可以去找些工作，自已養活自已，或竟可以找到了自己的媽媽。</p>
<p>H市是一個市街繁華；風景美麗的城市，當她走到時，剛正上午七點鐘，她耳所聽到的。，眼所看”的；樣樣都覺得新奇，覺得有趣。她無目的地不知該向那襄去，於是便戰戰兢兢的在四义路徘徊着。這時忽然來了一個警察，惡狠狠地不由分說，拉了她就走，她嚇得發抖，大哭求　，可是誰也不去理會她。結果，她被拉進了拘留所。這時的她，又後悔，又氣，又駕惶，心理真有說不出的苦悶，除哭泣而外，一句話也說不出了。經過三四天，轉了兩三個地方，她被送進了這濟良所，裏面有和她年齡相仿的姊妹們，有寸步不離的管理先生，衣食和居住，倒也還安頓，她以為這是人關的天堂，以後可以識字做工，安安穩穩地生活下去了。臘知事實的表現，却又完全出於她的意外；管理先生，一變了初見時的和藹態度而為猙獰兇惡的面目，一天到晚的呵叱着，鞭策著，使她惶惶不可終日；同時食物的營養不够，十幾個人擠在一間寢室裏，空氣日光，當然是根本談不到，而且終年禁閉，不准出門一步：滿腹優愁，無處訴說。這麽的過了二一年，愛花巳經是臉色蒼白；骨瘦如柴，肺病巳到了第二期了，</p>
<p>幸而後來來了一位慈悲的管理先生，她很同情所女們，尤其是愛花，知道她有了肺病，於是為她設法治療，設法營養，到這時，愛花才嘗到了些人間的所謂慈愛。不料這慈悲的先生來了不到一個”，就被後來的主持者辭退了。愛花知道了這個消息，感到異常悲痛，因為她不久將失去這位慈母般的先生，她哭了，她痛哭了！正哭得傷心的時候，忽然聽到雷吼一般的呵叱，同時背上被鐵一般的拳頭，連打了三四下，可憐！她頭昏了，心痛了，在地上滾作一團，正如將被宰割的一隻小羊，立刻咳聲大作，吐出了一大攤鮮血，想反抗，又被　鐵拳頭威脅得不敢動彈，後來才知道這位鐵拳頭的先生，原來是該所主持者的弟兄，因為憎惡她這一次感情的流露——惜別，才下此鐵拳，從此，愛花便病倒在床上，過着病苦的生活。</p>

<h3 id="c201">第五節　第二次大戰前夜的婦女 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>自從一九二九年秋天紐約證劵交易所的恐慌（Panic）爆發以後，資本主義世界就開始走上了絕望的黑暗之路。許多的學者，資本家，投機業者及政論家們都相信景氣循環的原理，主張景氣恢復的可能性，渴望着資本主義的黃金時代的再至！可是無情的現實却打破了他們的幻想。白從恐慌勃發以來，巳經有六年之久，而這恐慌不但沒有終止的希望，反而史廣汎的擴大到世界的範圍，更深刻的把握住每個人的心靈。方說恐慌是洪水，那末資本主義世界中的人們都淹在這洪水中漂流着，掙扎着，於是乎各國都在講究自救之道，企圖把自國從恐慌的濁流中　救出來！</p>
<p>可是，自救之道在那裏呢！只有一個方法就是要犧牲他國而繁榮自國之戰爭！我們知道在這次恐慌以後，各國間巳經開始了「你死我活」的戰爭，這就是所謂關稅戰爭和貨幣戰爭，現在這些經濟戰爭正在轉變到毒瓦斯和炸彈的戰爭。在東方的滿洲巳經　過了頭陣，在西方的菲洲正在準備大屠殺！這樣，人們所咀咒的可怕的戰神，終於瀉到我們的頭上來了！現在是人類的大滅毀的前夜！人們都在這可怕的戰神之前發抖！</p>
<p>不過，在這二次大戰的前夜，我們婦女不能不回想起第一次帝國主義戰爭時的慘痛的往事。因而又不能不準備應付必然到來的明日的大難！</p>
<p>各資本主義國家的婦女在這二次大戰的醞釀期中，巳經經騐了種種苦難的生活。各國政府為着緩和失業恐慌，便公然剝奪婦女的勢動權，為着增殖戰爭中當砲灰的國民，便要婦女在家裏生育子女，為着把婦女作為戰時的後方兵卒，對於婦女施以軍事訓練，這樣，各國政府把婦女看作準備戰爭之必要品，把她放在國家的乃至軍事的統制之下了！</p>
<p>我們在報紙上時常看到各國婦女們對將來戰爭的準備的活動。其中最顯著的乃是日本和德國的婦女。一九三二年組織的大日本國防婦人會，到今年四月末為止，會員總數達一百六十八萬八千四百二十四名，據說這會的發展非常之快，現在在關東州及滿洲也啊這會支部的組織，牠完全在軍部的指導之下，要執行戰爭中婦女所能做到的任務是不待言的。</p>
<p>其次德國自從希特勒上台以來，岌岌乎準價戰爭，到最近宣佈重整軍備以後，全國婦女也要負起國防的責任。據最近的柏林通訊；「現有德意志婦女六百萬名巳受相當訓練，以備戰爭時為國家服務。此外更有兩倍於此數的女子，目下正在敎練中，俾國家一旦有事，即可應用此所具之能力，以符新全國徵兵制之規定。」「……目下德國女子加入防空恊會及航空學會者約六百萬人，共他年在十八歲二十歲至五十歲之間者亦均從事於較普通之活動，總之德國全體婦女均由國社黨加以登記，以價國家有事時之調用。」（大美晚從八月三日）</p>
<p>這種情形，在目前資本主義各國都是同樣，尤其最近的意大利，正在動員全國的人民，把男子送到菲洲的戰綫，而把婦女編入於軍需品工業的勞動隊伍，一若第一次世界大戰時的情形。</p>
<p>但是在這裏，我們婦女必須注意者有兩點，第一點就是資本主義社會的戰爭，表面上雖　起「愛國」或『民族生存』的旗子，但在骨子裏有幾個資本家為着獲得他們的商品市塲，更為着獲得大量的利潤而發起的東西。戰爭的結果，即使得到了勝利，也祗是幾個資本家的勝利，大多數參戰的人民不是當砲灰，便是虛幻的歡喜！尤其婦女無論其勝敗如何，都不能得根本的解放。第一次大戰的經騐吿訴我們，不論戰勝國或占敗國的婦女，都祗有失去了她們的丈夫和子女，加重了婦女的慘痛的生活！因此我們應當起來堅决的反對戰爭。第二點，我們旣認淸現代戰爭的本質，那末，我們必須在戰爭中積極的獲取婦女自身的解放，我們知道在第一次大戰中蘇聯的婦女們都很積極的參加這一種解放戰爭，結果得到了最後的勝利！</p>
<p>「附言」我在以十八講中，很簡括的叙述了各主要時代及社會的婦女生活，這也許可以說是婦女生活小史，想就此完結，作為本講話的上篇。從　九講起，對於這歷史的發展中所提出的婦女問題及婦女解放運動等現實問題，加以具體的講述，但因講者能力有限，且有種種限制，不能副讀者的雅望，抱歉　很！尙望讀者加以不客氣的指正。</p>
<h3 id="c202">嘉興南湖船娘的生活 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 觀亭</p>
<p>浙江嘉與的南湖，又名　　湖，風景甚好。那著名的烟雨樓，　立在湖的中央，還附有許多亭　榭閣，互相輝映，更有許多古蹟，可供憑弔，所以常是遊人如織，極為熱鬧，只因為烟雨樓四面環水，無陸路可通，往遊的人，必須坐了船。才可以渡過去。</p>
<p>那搖船的都是一般靑年女子，大的不到三十歲，小的僅十三四歲，每一隻船上大抵都有兩個，遊人稱之船娘。</p>
<p>這般船娘，為了要誘至遊客的緣故，都是塗脂抹粉，裝束務趨時髦，寗可有吃而不省穿。大凡進人總是下午和夜間出來的為多，所以這般船娘在上午都不大出來，或在家裏休息，或在船上把船洗擦淸潔，一到了下午，她們便一齊濃裝艷抹拋出來招攬生意了。</p>
<p>她們出來以後，便去沿街拉客，甚至每値滬杭路的火車到嘉興站時，她們竟有老遠跑到車站上去接客的呢，</p>
<p>「擺渡擺嗎？」「擺倷去！擺倷到烟雨樓去白相！」「儂的船潔爽呢，儂擺倷去好嗎？」……這一類的話，是她們在招攬遊客時的用語。若是見遊客點頭應允了，她們便非常高興，忙含笑引路，領遊客到她們的船上；若是客人不濯，她們便向那客撅一撅嘴唇，又去招攬別個。</p>
<p>她們却都很和氣，倘使你上了她們的船，招待非常週到，過着有名的南湖菱或藕上市的時候，她們會拿出剝好的菱肉，或是糖醃的藕來餉客，不過吃了她們一碟子菱肉或藕，除船資以外，至少應賞她們二毛錢哩。</p>

<p>— 蘇虹</p>
<p>修珍照例地從山上打柴回來，臉上雌有點紅，但多半是靑。當她從屋後轉過來的時候，嫂嫂在舉着屁股拔芥菜，泥土跟着菜根一堆堆的翻出來。</p>
<p>太公站在旁邊，把小石子隨時拾起丟在一邊，口裏喃喃地說：</p>
<p>—實在，你以為我同你交量米，你看你這塊地泥土多硬，都是石子，我要用得着這塊地，得費十工功夫還不够，把石子都拿掉，把泥土翻個身，今年不必設，明年上春頭捻兩船湖泥，埔上去，那才可以種菜呢。</p>
<p>太公走後，嫂嫂瞧　菜，瞧瞧空了的地，呆立了一下，就到廚房中取了菜刀，坐在矮凳上，切菜頭。</p>
<p>珍修把柴　在廊下，母親囑咐她說：</p>
<p>—肉！你把柴抓一點開來，吹吹風。」</p>
<p>修珍進門脫草鞋，母親　　着說：</p>
<p>—菜園已經掉了呢！唉！她嘆着氣。「道樣小的芥菜拔掉了……總是保不住……這塊地……』</p>
<p>嫂嫂燒了一大鍋菜粥，將吃中餐的時候，她給孩子抱上凳，笑着對送念佛，錢來的佑福婆婆說：</p>
<p>—哪！我妹妹帮我做家呢！她天天替我打柴來。」轉頭向修珍：</p>
<p>—妹妹！吃粥，我燒了糊洋洋的粥。」她又轉換語調對孩子說：「小兒！坐過來一點，別換着姑姑！」</p>
<p>佑福婆婆把銅板交給母親：</p>
<p>—宗貴老太太叫我送來的念佛錢，妮說是一共七十二，前次你借的十四個扣下了，這裏是五十八個銅板，你數一數！」說着眼睛瞧一下臬上糊洋洋的粥。</p>
<p>慈悲的母親知道佑福婆婆也和她自已一樣，而且是一個人，什麽兒女也沒有，孤老零丁地住着一所草棚，總算會念念佛度日子，得了念佛工的時候，日食兩餐，有的是一餐，所以經常都是挨戶地走着，待人家吃飯的時候，楷點油。</p>
<p>—佑福嬸嬸你吃碗，熱烘烘的。」母親端過一碗粥。</p>
<p>嫂嫂的眼睛橫射着那提過去的一碗粥。她雖不說話，肚子裏却很肉痛，她想着：這碗粥呀！是那塊押掉的地哩，多吃掉一碗粥就是少下一塊地。」大孩傾頓了一點粥，她就趁此機會洩憤，筷頭如雷鼓的在兒十子頭上，軋軋軋」地打了一陣：「小鬼！沒有吃，吵吃，有吃啦，吃不端正。」</p>
<p>佑福婆婆吃得老虎啗蝴蝶似地，稍徵胞點肚子就要開始講這，講那了：</p>

<p>— 擴情</p>
<p>生活的過程就是戰門的歷史，這是一切有生之物的共同原　，當然人類也不能例外。一切生物要生存，牠抵抗着自然的寒暑饑渴的壓迫，而和自然相鬥爭，抵抗着同類生物的迫害，而和別的生命相鬥爭，牠不斷地在鬥過程中保持共生命，因以生活於世界上。人類，在根本的生活形　是完全相同的，他和自然界　鬥，從生產的鬥爭中獲得生活的資源，免去了寒暑饑渴種種的壓迫，他也和一般的生命相鬥爭，防禦着別的生物對他的危害，利用和克服馴的生物供自己的使用，偽自己成為戰爭中的勝利的支配者。他更在一定的進化階段中和人類自己相戰鬥，爭取個人的和與他利害相同的社會羣的生存利益及權利。從此可知生生活　鬥爭，沒有鬥爭卽沒有生命，不能戰鬥的即不能生活。</p>
<p>人類和一般生物，雖都同樣的是在戰鬥中生活，但在普通的生物的戰鬥方式，多半是以個別的直接反應形式從事戰鬥，簡單地依環境而决定其　直接的戰鬥方式。猛虎相門只是以牙還牙，以爪還爪，狠追來了綿羊只有簡單的逃走。雖然花貓捕鼠也知道先伏着不動，　牠的對方不知道牠，然後突然躍去將老鼠捕獲，但這始終仍只限於本能衝動的鬥爭方式。人類則不然，因為人類有很複雜的社會生活，所以他的戰鬥是經過許多曲綫的，處處都得看淸複雜環境之錯綜的關係，加以意識的鑑別，甚至要知道選擇和計劃出各種戰鬥的方式與策略，才能制勝。因此，在人類的生活陣綫上活動，為了生活而鬥爭時，對於戰術與戰略是不能不嚴格講求的。</p>
<p>廣義地說來，人類對於自然界舉行鬥爭，也有他的戰術與戰略，因為人類自身如就他的本身能力來說，他是旣無猛　　虎那樣的氣力，也無她們所具備的銳爪利牙，更無飛鳥能在空中飛騰的技巧，良馬狡兔的着走能力，所以他在單憑體力本能而戰鬥時，就連在生物羣中也算不得强者，更不要說征服偉大的自然力。然而人類畢竟成為生物之王，成為自然界之征服者，這是靠他有各種戰鬥的巧妙技術，有一定　勝的戰術的緣故。人類的這些戰鬥的技術，便是人類的生產技術。一切科學的發達，作為人類本身器官而延畏，變形，改善了的人為器官，如機器和一切生產工具，乃至利用這些工具從事生產的方法，卽是人類的生產技術，人類在生活綫上戰鬥的技術。人類和自然鬥爭不但有這些特別巧妙的技術，而且還有一定的戰略，這戰略便是利用自然自己去制服自然。人類本身雖然是弱小的動物，但他在戰鬥中郤能利用精良的戰鬥技術，利用以自然制服自然的戰略，便能克服自然，這是一般生物在生活戰綫上所不知講求的戰術與戰略。</p>
<p>在社會生活上，因為在一定的社會演進階段裏，是把人類分劃成若干層的羣集，甚至分劃成個別的人而使之在不同地位和利害關係中生活着，因此人與人之間的戰鬥在這樣的社會裏也是普遍地發展着的。人類在個人主義的和利害各別的若干羣集的社會裏生活，時時都有各種性質與形式的鬥爭，不鬥爭卽不能生存，所以這種生活上的戰術與戰略，更是有複雜形式的，而且也是自然要發展出來，並成為各個羣集與個人所必需講求的。事實　常顯，在這有個別的經濟體系存在的社會裏，最顯著的首先就是依於種族關係和政治經濟之治理的各別的集團間，卽所謂民族國家間，無時不在鈎心鬥角的互相對立與鬥爭中，因而產生了民族國家的軍事，政治，經濟等等的外交上的戰術與戰略。誰要不講求這些戰術與戰略，誰要不善於利用它，小之則可以造成交交上的失敗，大之甚至可以斷送他的民族和國家的生存。特別是近代大民族國家出現的時代，更是抱全體國民都導入了這種門爭中，依於治理者的戰術與戰略而參加戰鬥了。</p>
<p>在每一個民族國家裏，再由於這有利害不的社會層之有在，把社會形成不統一的羣集間的對立，而時時發生着劇烈的鬥爭。從政治，經濟，社會之各種設施上，各自為了自己的羣集的生活上的利益，各有不同的政見，每一個社會羣集，都形成自己的政黨，為着爭取國家的領導權，互相鬥爭。於是在選舉中，在一切的國家機關中，在議會中，乃至對於一切政令與社會的設施等等，也各有其政治上的戰術與戰略。而且它的政黨卽專以製造這些戰術與戰略，並領導它的羣集運用這些戰術與戰略而鬥爭為任務。所以在近代社會裏，全體人民也即均被納大於這種私的集團利益爭奪的戰術與戰略之講求和執行的生活中了。</p>
<p>至於個別的私人呢？為了生活的需要，在這個人主義的自利觀念發展的社會裏，也必得時時為他自己的生活和利益打算，而講求戰術與戰略。例如許多人在前進的時代前進，而在後退的時代又後退，有些甚至强違具理智的支配而改變自己的一切，使自己前後判若兩人，這可以說完全是為了個人的生活利益而行的一種戰術與戰略。</p>
<p>人類要生活就不能不戰鬥，要戰鬥就隨時隨地都得講求戰術與戰略，所以我們並不反對隨時隨地都講求戰術與戰略，甚至在社會裏也承認這是生活上的必要。但是，在分裂的世界裏，我們只能承認弱者們對戰術與戰略的講求是應當的，因為他們如不鬥爭和不講求戰鬥的戰術與戰略，根本就無法生存。至於在未來的世界裏，其鬥爭是專以自然為對象的，所以人類要發展的是科學和生產技術，卽要講求的只是對自然而鬥爭的戰術與戰略，而人與人之間的戰鬥的戰術和戰略，在生活上就沒有必要了。</p>

<h3 id="c206">怎樣過流浪生活？ <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 健羣</p>
<p>在流浪生活中，經濟的壓迫，身體的疲乏，心情的煩惱，這是難免的，但，假如你能够了解「流浪」的意義，懂得過流浪生活的方法，那也可以减少幾分痛苦的。所以一個流浪生活者，尤其是初期流浪的人，是應該學習流浪的技巧，注意各種奧妙，所謂「討口也要拜師」，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>有些人受了生活的鞭策，不得不東西奔波的找尋職業，但」奔波」不是盲目的，而是要有計劃的「投靠」。在未去某處之前，對於該處的人事關係都要弄確定，營謀的職業最少也要有一半以上的把握，假如貿然前去，徒靠新的追求，難免不發生問題，縱然結果並未走到絕路，但所受的損失也就很大了。共實對於該處的生活情形，個人的朋友多少，都須預先調查淸楚，一則便於籌劃自己的經濟，一則一旦職業發生問題，可免流落他鄉，耗費金錢，時日</p>
<p>其次，旅費問題也是流浪者所常感到的困難。有時別處已有機會找取職業，但以旅費缺乏，坐令良機喪失，所以平時對於交通機關的情形要弄熟悉。據我所知，平漢路上的「加點車」和「媒車」是可以不收車費的，假如你在漢口急於要去北平，那就不必遷延時日活動路費，很可以乘坐這種便宜車前去，雖然吃苦一點。還有，俊車和快車的車費相差很遠，譬如上海到南京，特別快車要三元七角多，而慢車的四等祗要兩元，位置有時並不怎樣擁擠，耽擱的時間也祗三個多鐘頭，你如果願意節省的話，最好還是趕慢車。不過你要切實的注意，慢車上的小偷很多，他們不敢到那憲兵警察保護周密的特別快車里去挖高貴　客的財喜，祇好跑上乘坐慢車的窮朋友中來寫生意，一旦有了機會，他們是不會顧及你的窮因而要把你的唯一的財產奪去了的。防避的方法自然很多，然而也要懂得其中巧妙，纔不致白費精力，輪船開行前和拋錨後都是小偷「用武」的時候，你要注意自己的行李，等到船巳開行，纔可安穩的休養精神。至於坐火軍，則最要注意第一次停站，因為小偷們總是在車開行不久，乘着旅客混亂中偷竊東西，到了第一個站口，便要下車　好回返城市。這情形在平漢路上表現得最明顯，因為平漢路上的小偷比別處更多。</p>
<p>在旅途中，不妨多認識幾個老實的朋友，這一則可多了解目的地的情形，二則沿途有人照應，三則可藉此消遺愁苦中的時日，活潑自己的心情，不過談話要誠　，態度不要輕挑，否則別人要誤認你「飄一字」，「跑江湖」的壞人了。未到目的地前，對於該處旅館客棧的名稱，地址，和房金都須詢問淸楚，以免臨時慌亂，徒受無謂的損失。還須注意的：碼頭上的情形，搬運行李的規矩，也須大槪的明瞭，不然「敲竹槓」破壤了經濟的預算，給你的打擊也很不小呵！</p>
<p>流浪生活者，在平時須多學習各地的語言，最少也要說得上幾句日常用語。這不單是可使營謀工作比較便利，而</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>且還可减少許多困難。自然，要學習各省的語言，非短時期所能生效，但學幾句普通的必需的用語，也很容易。譬如人力車在上海叫「黃包車」，天津叫「膠皮」，成都簡稱「車子」，靑島，北平叫「洋車」，香烟在北方稱「菸　」，廣州稱「菸仔」，四川稱「紙菸」，……：祇要能够把名字說得上來，你都可减少許多麻煩。雖然因為聲調不純熟，別人仍知道你是外鄉人，但總不敢當你是初到的。</p>
<p>至於流浪中的住居問題，是要依照你的身份和經濟能力為轉移，同時也要與你活動的對象和交際的塲面相適應的。假使你所「投奔」的朋友是個幹闊差事而又愛面子的，你所營謀的也是闊工作，往還的人們也都很漂亮，那麽就得住一個中等以上的旅館，以免關係方面輕視你寒酸，雖然你的旅　有點兒羞澁，也要勉强撑持下去，不過還要斟酌職業是否可靠，不然以後的苦頭就大了了！其實流浪者是沒有闊綽的交際的，為了經濟的打算，還是找那價廉的住所的好。假如你要在北平居住一月兩月，最好是找一家適當的公寓，連膳食一起在內，每月不過十三四元，而且茶水便利，照應周到，（這種公寓，無論東城西城都很多的）很適合流浪知識份子的身份和口味。若再要久住，還可自己租房子，中等點的，每月不過二三元的租金。吃飯可買飯票，每月六七元就得了。上海的生活比北平要貴三分之一，單拿公寓來說，食宿一道起碼要化二十二三元，如果住得上一月兩月的話，還是租房子比較合算。在偏僻的地帶，五元錢可租亭子間，三四元可租後樓，在工人飯館解决兩餐，一天二毛錢便可馬虎過去，全月計算，大致需要十二元。但在廣州同漢口却都不容易租到房子，而且還要有家眷及鋪保。所以流浪到這兩處的人，祗有住小客棧一條途徑。（廣州除了闊綽的「酒店」，中下等的客棧，還有一種學寓，名義上是學生寄宿舍，其實也可住普通旅客的，述火食每月約費小洋十六元至二十元）……。總之，各地的生活程度不同，地方情形不同，流浪者是要預先調查確實，繼好有計劃的漂流，生活上繼可避免意外的困難。</p>
<p>此外，如常識方面也是流浪老應該注意的。略舉幾個例子說吧。一，中國的幣制，紊亂已極，各省名縣者有幾種或幾十種「幣」的流行，然而流通的區域有一定的限制，這兒的「幣」帶到別省，往往成了廢物。上海通用的雙毫，明明是廣東造的，但拿到廣東反不通用，（在廣束名「舊毫子」，那兒用新毫子，上面鑄有中山先生的像）南京的毫子本同上海流行的一樣，但民國九，十年的却又不用。四川的銀元——名「川版」，是永久沒有走出夔關的資格，據說是因為銀質惡劣，成分不足之故。假如你不明曰這些「奧妙」，帶「川版」赴外省，帶民國九，十年的毫子到南京，而旅費又　缺乏，那你馬上就有餓飯危險的。二，在香港，海關上的檢查特別嚴格，竹　特別敲得厲害，凡帶着新鮮的貨物都要納稅或被沒收，就是帶了一筒以上的香烟，（最好截開蓋子）也要納稅，而且還要受罰。你如果不明瞭這些情形，由上海帶一筒香烟到廣州送朋友，那就難免不大觸霉頭了！三，海船上的飯食難吃，（有石子，很澱口）又沒有菜，在可能範圍內動身前便要預備一些乾糧。然而趕火車却不同了，沿路停站都有飲食可買，又新鮮，又便宜，若是預先備置，倒反是做了一椿笨事了！</p>
<p>哲學講座</p>
<h3 id="c207">由實證主義到實用主義 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 卓然</p>
<p>實證主義是孔德的哲學體系，而實用主義則是美國詹姆士的哲學體系。這兩個哲學體系在名義上和形式內容上雖亦各有不同之點。但在總的思想原則上却有許多是相同的。在外表的形式上看來，它們兩者都是以經騐與實踐為主，成為經騐論的哲學。在孔德看來，人類思想的最終目的和他所能求知的，只是實證的經騐事實及其所啟示的法則，事物的本體是不可知的，所知的只是現象的事物。可是，現象事物知其法則，它們應該為人類服役，科學的工作是在於實證這些事物與法則，和綜合這此事物與法則，使它轉變為為人類服役的工具，而認識與知識也要在這裏才有價値和値得注意。詹姆士的實用主義呢？牠也與此種思想大體相同，不注重抽象的理論之論爭，而注重現實事態之證騐，只有在實踐中才能決定是非。所以一切眞理的認知和爭執是無邊際和止境的，在那裏不能獲得結果與價值。眞正有價値的只在有實用性，凡是合於實用的都是對的，反之則是無價値的和不對的。因此，實用主義在一定限度內也是經騐的和努力實踐的哲學。</p>
<p>但是，實證主義在反對了一切信仰的和幻想的抽象思維與原理之後，它却跨入了康德式的物不可知論與休謨式的現象論的領域。因為它認為想進入於本體的範圍是不可能的，本體本身即是不可知的。我們所能知和所當知的也只限於現象界的事物，即使事物是有本眞的，但在實踐的利益上說來，它對於人類進步也許是完全無關，甚至無益。實證主義到達於這樣的理論範圍時，遂進一步在其哲學中包含了否認客觀眞理的意義，因為它認為能為人類服役的就是好的，沒有一種客觀的絕對眞實的原理，沒有一種實體的本體作為基礎的統一性，它否認物本體之認知性的可能，否認客觀的本眞性和眞理之存在的可能，而以人類或其部分乃至個人之實際利益為前提，以决定一切事物的價値。這是以人為本位的人本主義的哲學的另一形式。在實用主義方面呢？它也是一樣認為一切原理原則的論爭是空的，不能達到究極的差別性，甚至說如果在實踐範圍不能證實其差別，則寧可說是同一的，沒有是非的。因此眞實的本質我們無法知道，或者就說根本上就沒有眞理。它對於原理，體系認為是難以達到的事物，只有具體的東西，可以達到的現象表現的東西和行動與事實等等，才是其所注意的。眞的東西只在合乎實用，面實用這件事却是以人的利益為依歸，所以它不但認眞理是難辨難言難知的，並且是沒有價値的。判斷事物只須依其現實的表現，只須依據各人在其實踐上以有實用的利益為標準去權衡是非，用不着甚麽別的原則標準，如此則爭論也就可以調和了。這樣實用主義也是含着物自身不可知論的，它的經騐是止步於現象和主觀的境界上，而不達於物之彼岸的，是眞理的否認論了。</p>
<p>本來，物自體不可知論，原是康德的二元諭的哲學。因為他一方面承認有物本體存在，但在這物本體不可知的意義下，是把我們所感覺的現象與由這現象反映於我們主觀上的意識，當作完全不能標識和表明物自身的東西。旣然主觀上的獲得物根本不能表明外物，則這些東西不過是主觀的心靈的產物與幻景，因為它不能作為外界事物的說明，也非外物所生起的東西，所以心理的一切是和外物並立，不相關係而各自獨立存在的，不管康德是否簡單地這樣自認主觀的意識中的事物只是心理的虛構，但那物自身不可知論的當然　輯是如此。實證主義者與實用主養者們，他們是根本不知道主觀依存於客觀，思維產生於實在，心理的一切是外界眞實的反映，因此它必然是栽程度地說明外界的東西。人類知識的進步，就是意味着外界反映的日益逼眞，科學之所以為科學，也就是在認知了外物之故，外物不是不可知的，只是其秘密在不斷的啟發中。外物是眞　存在的，對於它的知識也是逐漸獲得了的，那麽不管外界如何變動，但這變動也是客觀的眞實自身的變化。人類從變化中去獲得變化的眞實實，仍不失為客觀的眞理，眞理在其為客觀性的一點上不但是存在的，而且是絕對的，在其因客觀眞實自己的變化上，才是相對的，但不能以此否認眞理之存在。如果說沒有眞理或眞理無價値，那麽外界也不是眞實的，也是無意義和無價値的了。實證主義者與實用主義者主張着實踐的重要性，這在人類自身的立塲上是對的，因而注重一切合於實用與能促起人類進步的知識，在原則上不是不可以的。但是人類和其利益都出現得很晚，而且也只是自然界之一部分，所以不能說人類自身以外無宇宙且無眞理，人類不存在則眞理和世界都完了。而且人類的自身要求和觀念的成立，也是在自然和社會這種外的世界中生根，不是從人的本性中能獲得說明的。假使照實證主義與實用主義的意見發展下去，否認了客觀的眞理與是非，那麼每一偭人都有其實用性的見解，各種社會與各個人亦有不同的實用觀點，，則帝國主義的槍砲，壓迫者的刀，在他們也都是有實用性，而他們的壓迫與屠戮也就成為合理的眞理了。反之，反對者的抗爭更是合理的。這不但成為助紂為虐的理論，而且其矛盾也眞是無法解决。</p>
<p>實證主義與實用主義哲學所以發生的時代性，如果我們加以考察時，那麽它們是在近代社會成立以後，不能使大多數人滿意於其原來的理想，因而社會又發生了追求別的新的理想的傾向，於是他們不得不出來否認新理想的景仰是合理的，呌大家安於現狀的試騐中，甚至擁護對於少數人有實用價値的東西。當然，發達到最後，他們自己也對於他們的社會失望，在動搖中更需要妥協調和，所以一方面他們是悲觀着客觀眞理的憧憬之不可得，他方面則須得設法抹殺論爭和為眞理而奮鬥的合理性，以期在現實的生活中苟安於目前的利益，使人們不至超出於生活瑣事和部分的事態之實用觀點以外，並調和現存的矛盾而停止爭執。但是社會的進展巳把人類的大多數弄得絕無現實利益可圖了，在現實的日常生活事實中，找不出一點為自己利益的實用的意養，事態的覺證只證明他們的痛苦，所以追求新的眞理是不能遏止的，這種哲學仍不能救窮。就讓有些一人宣揚汪意眼前的實利和時間性，反對追逐眞理而前進，甚至否認有所謂客觀的眞理存在，恐怕也沒有甚麽用處罷！</p>

<p>— 劉玉淸</p>
<p>紹興通訊</p>
<p>紹與是浙江省一個並不怎麽大的縣，可是從歷史上看來倒是一向就使全國聞名的。其聞名的原因，一面是因遜淸時代各地官署都有「紹興師爺」的足跡，於是地因人名；一面却是因為紹酒的暢銷，而這蕞爾小縣，便更加名聞宇內了。關於「紹興師爺」，儘可不必追憶旣往，多說廢話，我所要說的，正是在蓬蓬勃勃盛極一時的紹興釀酒。</p>
<p>紹與這裏沒有什麽風景，沒有什麽名勝，外路的遊人如果想到這裏來尋幽探勝，那保管你搖頭嘆息，大叫一聲「上當」回去。但是有太白癖的人到這裏來了，我敢担保他是不想回去的。紹興的街道並不多，也沒有像上海那樣寬展的馬路，但酒肆之多，却佔全部份商店十之五六；祗要一踏上街頭，滿眼所見的都是些什麽「太白遺風」，「淳于一石」，「劉李停車」的靑龍牌。</p>
<p>這裏酒肆有那麼多，吃酒的人數當然也可以想見，像魯迅寫的「孔乙巳」式的酒客人，那更是多得不可勝數了。所以一般的酒肆的佈置，也就因了「醉翁之意」確「在酒」而就馬虎了許多。一家酒肆中，除了有幾張桌子和幾隻樸古的酒器外，那所能看到的便祗是些酒罎子，而一般嗜酒的人從或工作忙得不可開交，也還是要抽空溜到酒肆櫃檯前姑着吃個盡興的。</p>
<p>紹興人歡喜吃紹酒自是意中事，而非紹興人也歡喜吃紹酒，就是紹酒的製造比人高勝一籌的原因：但中國釀酒的地方可以說是無處無之，那末，為什麽獨有紹酒能這樣風聞于世呢？這自然也是大有原因的。據釀酒人說的譬喻：「米是酒的肉，麵是酒的骨，水是酒的血」，依此可以見到水在酒中所佔地位的重要了。據說紹酒的成名便是因了鑑湖水的帮助。考鑑湖距紹興約三里，乃漢代馬太守所築；後來鑑湖本身雖廢，但由牠而成的許多支流，其水道仍舊沒有變異，其中的水最優美的要算是靑田湖了，各酒戶釀酒的水便是取之這湖的。</p>
<p>紹酒用了「鑑湖」的水做原料，再加以釀造方法的講究，如果還不能出好酒，那就有點不近情理吧！紹酒製造的方法，可分為「淋飯」與「攤飯」兩種。「淋飯」方法，便是先用上好的糯米浸入水中，經過相當時間後取出來再放到地灶裏蒸熱，然後移置木桶裏，用冷水淋一兩次，使其溫度降低，這就楚所謂「回水」。飯淋好了就放入一隻可盛數祖水的大缸裏面：缸底在飯未放入之前，先就撒滿一層酒藥粉墊着，飯傾入後，又加放五六兩酒藥粉下去，把飯粒和藥粉拌勻，然後用手緩緩地壓實，並在中間掘出一個凹進去的酒窩。這手續完成了，外面祗要披上一些稻草，使缸裏的溫度不至馬上低减，便容易發酵；這樣經過一二天，缸裏凹陷的酒窩就有「酒娘滲出。「酒娘」做成後，可加淸水和浸米的水漿若干，—所用的成分有三水四漿及四漿三水之別—麥麵也在這時加入；再經歷一晝夜的時間，酒飯和麥麵便都向上浮起來，這就是「開耙」的時候了。「開耙」是一句術語，明白的說，卽是拿木耙在缸裏搗亂，使其發酵均勻；搗耙的次數，大約搗到不覺費勁時為止。此時糟粕便漸漸下沉，酒漿便澄淸起來，經過一月的時間就可以取用了。不過由這種方法　成的酒大都不耐久藏，一般大酒戶都不願採用這種方法的。還有「攤飯」法，浸米時稍久，然後撈起來蒸熟，攤放在竹編的簾子上，使溫度降低，便倒入先貯有水漿的缸內，同時傾入酒釀九斤，麥麵三四斗，與飯粒攪拌均勻，然後蓋上缸蓋及稻草，祗須經過一晝夜就可「開耙」。「開耙」了兩次，再經過七十多天的時間便可榨酒了。酒榨出來之後。還得把牠傾入鐵護裏煎煮，放下砂糖汁拌勻，這樣製酒手續纔算完成。</p>
<p>紹酒的原料，除了水是鑑湖的特產外，至於糯米，多數還是靠江蘇的金壇，溧陽，無錫，丹陽各地供給；麥麵也是由自己製造，但不是特產。製麥麵的方法，是用大麥兩成，小麥八成，晒乾了磨碎，到冬至後，便將麥粉傾入桶裏，加上若干水份攪勻，再用人工踐踏，使其成為堅實的硬塊，然後才取出來砌成磚形的長條，外面包上稻草，把牠放入密閉的麵室裏閉着。經過月餘的時間，等麵變成了黃色，才可以把稻草拿掉，這樣，再過一個月就可以應用了。製酒除了水，米及麥麵三種原料之外，酒藥粉也是少不了的。不過進種原料也是向外地購買；酒藥分黑白兩種，黑藥出自富陽，白藥產在寗波。白藥的原料為辣草蓼和早米粉；黑藥則除上述兩種外，還有陳皮，花椒，蒼朮，甘草各種藥末。</p>
<p>紹興現有大小酒記大約在一千八百家左右；祇要打從蕭山到紹興的公路上經過，便可看到許多層層疊疊的巒嶂似的酒罎，一起一伏的排列着，那裏便都是些酒戶。在這些酒戶中間，資力最雄厚的要算是章東明，沈永和，王友梅幾家。章東明的資本大槪有三十多萬，一年可以產酒一千七百多缸：出客的有「狀元紅」「花彫」「竹葉靑」「女兒紅」數種。沈永和却以「善釀」著稱，但考其實際，與普通的製法也並沒有多大的差異，不過以酒代水，再加上糯米和麥麵混合起來，使製成的酒味帶點甜味罷了，可是在眞心嗜酒的人倒並不喜歡喝這種酒的。至於王友梅，則以京莊著稱，上海方面好像都喜歡吃這種酒，聽說現在招待外賓也都用它的。這許多酒戶釀的酒，除在本埠銷售以外，他如上海，杭州，寗波，以及長江珠江各流域，幾乎沒有一處沒有它的踪跡。紹興酒之所以出名，大槪也就在這裏吧？</p>
<p>業餘修學</p>
<h3 id="c209">怎樣研究歷史？ <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 漁甫</p>
<p>廚川白村在其「苦悶的象徵」中說：「一切東西的發達，是從簡單進向複雜的。所以要明白或一事物的本質，便該先去追溯本源，回顧道在最眞純而且簡單的原始時代的狀態。」人類的生活也是「由簡單進向複雜」的；如果沒有封建時代的農業和手工業的生活，甚至說如果沒有原始時代茹毛飲血的粗野而單純的生活，那人類就决不能享受近代的「文明」生活。所以，我們要明白現在，預測未來，便非知道現在乃至未來之所由來不可，換言之，即便是非研究過去的歷史不可。</p>
<p>再說，「人是他們自己的戲劇的著作者兼表演者」，所以人不僅是生活於社會中，而且還是歷史的動物，還是「他們自己的壓史的表演者和著作者」。我們研究歷史，就是在研究我們人類過去的活動和創造，同時，也就是在憑籍對於過去的了解以創造未來的歷史，走向光明之路。因此，只要不是糊裏糊塗過活的人，以要是淸醒的認眞生活的人，他一定要』研究過去，理解現在，於創造人類歷史中創造其個人的生活，即是說，他一定要去理解過去的歷史，接受人類過去生活的經騐，從而覺悟地參加人類創造歷史的工作，在歷史的舞台上扮演那推動歷史前進的最重要的脚色。</p>
<p>那麼，怎樣去研究歷史呢？過去我們的許多史家之記載歷史，只是記載朝代的變遷，皇家實族的言論與行為，英雄豪傑畢生的事業及其生卒年日，此外如一般民間的生活，社會經濟之變遷，都非他們所注意的。像這樣地對付歷史，至多也只能知道一些關於出現在壓史舞台上的那些上等人物的事實，對過去的歷史仍是莫名其妙的。所以我們的研究歷史不能採取這種不科學的不中用的方法，我們要找尋歷史發展的因果法則，考究人類社會的組織形式，探討社會進化十歷史變遷與前進的動力，因為要這樣才能反映客觀的歷史的發展變化的因果法則為我們主觀的研究歷史的法則，從而以此合於歷史的科學方法去研究歷史，才能眞的理解過去，創造未來。這里我們可以引出這個著名的公式來！</p>
<p>「人們在其生活之社會的生產中竄入於决定的。必然的，與自己意志無關涉的諸關係里，即是生產關係，這是和人們物質的生產力之某一個旣定的發展階段相應。這些生產關係之總和形成社會之經濟的結構，即是一種法律的和政治的上層建築之所於以建立而各種既定的社會的意識形態與之相應的現實的基礎。物質的生活之生產方法規約着社會的政治的和法律的生活過程之一般。不是人們意識决定自己的存在，反是自己的社會的存在决定自己的意識。到了發展中之某一個階段上，社會之物質的生產力與向來於其中所活動着的旣成的生產諸關係，如單依法律的表現時，則為財產講關係，陷入於矛盾。這些關係由生產力之發展形態一變而為生產力之桎梏。於是遂行一社會革命之時期出現。隨着經濟的基礎之變革，全部龐大的上層建築或緩或急地自行崩潰。……」</p>
<p>依此我們可以見到社會的組織是以經濟為基礎的，壓史的發展變化亦是隨着社會經濟之發展變化而出現的。過去歷史上的政治的變革，叛亂和戰爭的發生，社會思想的變易，朝代的更換，都與社會的經濟形態有不可分離的關係，都不是絕對偶然的現象。至於出現在歷史舞台上的英雄豪傑，都是由於在一定的經濟基礎上的社會之需要而湧現出來的，絕對不是什麽星宿下凡。所以，我們在研究歷史時，就不僅要知這朝代的變遷，叛亂和戰爭的事實，而且更應明白其所以發生的社會根源；對於那般英雄豪傑的人物，也是不僅要知道其事業和生活情况，而且更應理解其在怎樣的社會條件下產生，對於人類社會起了怎樣的作用。因為要這樣，我們才能真的理解歷史，理解歷史上的人物；才不致於成為知其然而不知其所以然的庸俗的歷史研究者。</p>
<p>拿中國的歷史來說吧。在過去中國的歷史中最惹人注意的史實，如秦始皇的併吞六國，和他的廢封建置郡縣和焚晝坑儒的政策，王莽的篡位，和他的復活井田制度，以及唐代的黃巢之亂，明代的王安石之變法，淸代的戊戌政變乃至於辛亥革命……等重大事情，都是在一定的社會制度，經濟情况下產生的，絕不是毫無根源的偶然現象。但是，過去的史家只是去記載這些事情的經過，並不去考究其所以然的根源，因而也就沒有對這些史實作正確的說明；有時候，他們竟不惜以一己的偏見，採用所謂「褒貶筆削」的辦法，無理地責駡那些為他們所不贊成的人物，如秦始皇王莽乃至於王安石、諸人，便是常為一般道學先生所設駡的。但這樣地對付歷史的辦法，結果是不僅不知道歷史的所以然，恐怕連事實也會弄得莫名其妙了。試看我們的二十四史吧，其中算真正說明了歷史的，恐怕一本都沒有。所以我們必須以新的方法來研究歷史，來整理中國社會史。對於我們，過去歷史上的一切事實不僅是客觀地存在着的，而且是有一定的社會根源的，所以我們要從社會的見地去找尋那些歷史事實的根源，因以說明那些歷史事實。我們不笑，也不哭，更不採用道學先生們的「褒貶筆削」的辦法，我們只是客觀地從社會的見地去研究歷史，說明歷史。譬如，秦始皇的廢封建置那縣和焚書坑儒，這是一般道學先生們所痛駡的，但對於我們，對於一般科學的歷史研究者，則是秦始皇之統一天下，打破封建劃據的局面，建立中央集權的政體，乃是由於商業資本發展的結果，說來還是進步的；至於始呈之坑儒，乃是坑的那些反對新社會的企圖後退的封建的僑生，並不是把所有的讀書人都坑了，事實上當時荀子一派的讀書人如李斯等就是未被坑的，所以我們在研究歷史時不能簡單地因為見到秦始皇焚書坑</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>儒的事實就去駡他，而忘掉了去說明這史實的任務，—這便是我們研究歷史時所應取的態度。</p>
<p>以下便算是研究歷史的基本方法。在這一基本方方法下，我們使須去找村料來實行研究。所謂歷史的材料者，不外是：　，鎮載歷史的書物　，從地窟中掘出的古董，三，民間流行的歌謠和傳說等。但是，在過去的許多材料中，特別是在中國過去的許多材料中，有許多是偽造的，以致使錢玄同先生在研究中國歷史時改其名爲疑古玄同　　以　　　　　集材料中必須辦其眞偽，本能隨便亂用。此外如整理材料，從事編著等，都還有很多問題。但因篇幅關係，只得略而不談了。</p>
<p>專述</p>
<h3 id="c210">華僑在全世界（十） <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>此外，在遠東方面還有許多重要地方是有許多華僑的，但以種種關係，只得略而不談了。</p>
<p>四　歐洲的華僑</p>
<p>我國與歐洲各國發生通商關係雖然很久了，但直到現在，全歐洲所有華僑只不過兩三萬人。茲特將歐洲各地華僑情形分述於后。</p>
<p>法國</p>
<p>在法國方面的華僑，除了留學生外，燉粹經商做工者很少。其中極少數的中國商人大多是在這里開設骨董店，旅館，飲食店及雜貸店等；其資本亦很少，因之有商塲中可說是沒有地位的。現任中委李石曾等在法國時曾在巴黎創辦一豆腐公司，使中國豆腐得在世界上大出風頭；但這公司現已停辦了，其原因大槪是在於缺乏經理人。至於在法國的華工，多半是在歐戰中法人在中國招募去的；此種華工在戰後有許多復被遺送回國，所以現在尙留居法國的華工，只有馬賽的海員和巴黎附近的工廠工人，為數也只有三兩百了。此外，散居在巴黎里昂等地的中國學生，共約有一兩千人。但此等學生流動性很大，隨時都有增減的，所以其人數很難確定。</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>在歐洲的華僑，除法國外，便以德國的為最多。在柏林及其他各地的中國商人，約有六七百。此外往來於上海及柏林之間兼做小生意的中國海員，約有六七十人。至於我國留德學生，大約也有五六百名。總計在德華僑不過一千人左右，在各方面都是不很重要的。</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>英國華僑人數也只有一千左右。他們）都分住於倫敦和利物浦等地，有的作水手，有的作工人；其在利物浦者，多半是洗衣工人。因為人數很少，在各方面都不很重要，所以英人對於在英華僑便不很注意，同時在英華僑也就很能平安無事地生活着，雖然他們的生活是此較窮苦的。</p>
<p>其他各國</p>
<p>除法德英之外，如蘇聯，比利時，荷蘭，瑞士，波蘭，奧大利，葡萄牙等國亦都有華僑的踪跡；右這些國家的華僑中佔最多數者，是海員，工人及留學生，但其人數有多少，現在還沒有一個確切的統計。如果以全歐的華僑人數來說，大約是在兩三萬左右；其中以工人與海員為最多，學生次之，商人最少。</p>
<p>五　美洲的華僑</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>說到美洲，當然是以美國為代表；所以我們談美洲的華僑應當從美國開始。</p>
<p>誰都知道，美國是比較後起而却發展得最快的資本主義國家。在十九世紀之初，美國正需要勞動力的時候，就有許多華工前往。及至加利福尼亞金礦發現後，華人往美者更是日益增加。據統計，一八九〇年為在美華僑最多的時期，其數達十萬七千四百八十八人。以後因為白種人的競爭，在美華僑就逐漸减少了。再加以美政府對於華僑的種種限制，及至現在為止，在美華僑更表現出沒有好多發展的前途了。（未完）</p>

<p>符保盧手推着小車隨着那般漁人向城內進發，島上的漁民，一個個都是蠻不講理，王導演好意向他們解釋，他們總是不受支配似的，所以拍這一段偉大的塲面，却費了不少的時候。</p>
<p>在道個崖崗的道上，田方推車，小符扶之，小陳在前面力的拉繩，三人累得滿身大汗，吃力非常，小陳在緊張空氣之下，仍是吃着他的大餅，　方喘着氣，面部的表情更是覺得陰沉，保盧的動作，處處顯得有力，眞是冉美沒有了。</p>
<p>方琲姑娘背着小辮子和她的妣如莉影赤着腳　，露着大腿蹲在海灘的礁石上檢拾蚜蚌？從遠處的海波里，隱隱地現現死人的浮屍屍，莉影一時靈感，想起了她打魚未歸來的丈夫，她使呆呆地望着上天，暗地的　吿：「龍王爺，我的丈夫你要保佑呀！」可是結　那海上飄浮的死屍，却是她的丈夫，她變態了，她瘋狂似的大哭起來了。</p>
<p>天真可愛的方琲，她真　沒有什麽似的，也不會去安慰她的姐如。</p>
<p>這一幕外景的工作異常困難，使每個工作的人都擔着很大的心。石礁上的蟹　，鋒利如刀，在水里工作的他們，都帶上了流血的傷痕，王導演　身十卒，所以他的傷痕更比別人多。老螀魏鵬飛穿着知褲下海了，開麥拉，曼沉勇石，也不顧性命的同海掙扎起來了。</p>

<h3 id="e9">National Government Establishes National County Budget Implementation Law <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The local government and people must strictly abide by the National Government's order on the 7th. The Zhou official system has ancient precedents. Modern financial management pays special attention to the budget. The current budget regulations in our country only apply to provinces and cities, and there are no regulations for county budgets. Last year, the Ministry of Finance convened a national financial conference in accordance with the order to discuss and decide on the handling of county local budgets, with six key points in the regulations, which were circulated by the Ministry to various provinces for compliance, limited to the establishment of national county budgets in the 24th year. Since the implementation, various provinces have been able to work hard. According to the Ministry's report, more than half of the provinces have submitted their approved county budgets to the Ministry, and those that have not been submitted are being rushed. It is estimated that they can be completed in the shortest time. Please clarify the implementation methods, announce compliance with the past. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the provincial and county budgets have been handled uniformly under a unified step. This is a pioneering work, which is a fundamental plan for reorganizing local finances and should be clearly defined for implementation and compliance. (1) After the local budget of the county is approved, the county government should print multiple copies, announce them in urban and rural areas, and disclose the full text in local newspapers issued or sold so that the people can be fully informed. (2) All local revenues and expenditures in the future must strictly abide by the scope of the budget. Those who collect outside the budget or law will be punished in accordance with Article 129 of the Criminal Law. Those who pay outside the budget or law will be ordered to compensate and be punished. (3) The people, in addition to not being obligated to pay for collections outside the budget or law, may also file complaints with higher authorities. (4) After the budget is announced, it shall not be submitted for modification unless there are major special circumstances. The above methods should be strictly observed and implemented by the local governments and people, and should be strictly supervised and implemented by the Ministry of Finance and the provincial governments, and the inspectors and local prosecutors in each district should pay attention to investigation and ensure that local finances are brought into a certain norm after the budget is established, so as not to be as chaotic as before. All those that have reduced the additional land tax and abolished exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes will not be revived again. From then on, the people's pain will be completely relieved, and eternal celebration will be achieved. There is great hope in this order. (7th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Bandits near Yuguan have now gathered more than 1,500 people. The bandit leader calls himself the King of the Mountains, originally named Wang Hong, who once served as the commander of the pseudo-East Asia Allied Army. On the 3rd of this month, Wang Fei led his troops to break into Yiyuan Pass, attempting to occupy Haiyang Town. Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, and Su Yuqi, the director of the Yuguan Special Public Security Bureau, after hearing the report, dispatched troops to block them and telegraphed Zhang Qingyu, the captain of the special police team, to send troops to assist in the suppression. The bandits then withdrew. On the 4th, they occupied Sanmenfang again, intending to break into Ziyukou. Two companies of Zhang Yantian's troops have rushed to intercept them. There was a small contact on the morning of the 5th. Now Linyu Yuguan has been placed under martial law. Zhan Shanh, the Yang Er bandit gang occupying Jiulong Mountain, is now surrounded by the four companies under the first and second security regiments and the militias of various counties. One company of the Security Team, Shao Dejian, rushed to the Jiangjunguan area to prevent bandit reinforcements. On the mornings of the 4th and 5th, the police and bandits fought fiercely. The bandits were finally defeated and retreated. Most of them fled to Yuzishan. Now there are more than 800 remaining bandits, carrying a machine gun, harassing everywhere. The local losses are huge. The security team captured 52 bandits alive, killed and wounded countless, and seized dozens of guns of various sizes and 30 horses. They have now rushed to encircle and suppress the fleeing bandits. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng is scheduled to go to the bandit areas of Zunhua and Qianxi before the 15th to inspect and instruct the county teams on defense and suppression methods, and to investigate the causes of the disputes between the Liujiang and Taiji mines and mediate. (7th dispatch)</p>

At night, the bandits broke through and fled to Yushou Mountain. The remaining troops are still more than 800. The security team captured 52 alive and killed countless. When the bandits fled, they looted along the way, and all the villages were ransacked. More than 1,000 bandits of the First Army of North China were found in Yiyuan Pass, intending to occupy Haiyang Town. The Shanhaiguan Public Security Team assisted the Linyu County Security Team in rushing to the area north of the Great Wall for defense. The bandits retreated to Sanjianfang, intending to enter Ziyukou. On the 5th, the Liushouying Security Team went to suppress them and had already made contact. (7th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun arrived in Hankou on the Longhe steamship at 4:00 p.m. on the 7th. According to him, the central government is paying great attention to water management. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 3rd approved the fundamental solution of dredging, guiding, abandoning fields and returning to lakes, and the plugging of breaches as a temporary solution, without issuing disaster relief bonds. It can be said that the method has been determined and is only waiting for implementation. Hubei Province's disaster relief will be based on emergency agricultural relief as a temporary solution and work relief as a fundamental solution. Emergency agricultural relief funds will be raised by the province itself and donations from all parties, and work relief funds will be allocated by the Economic Council. There are many collapsed embankments in Hubei, and there are also official and civilian embankments. In the future, after repairs, the overall planning will be the fundamental solution, which can avoid disputes between officials and civilians and give the people psychological comfort. The delimitation of Hubei and Anhui is also related to water conservancy issues, because the Mahua embankment is jointly managed by the three provinces, which is quite inconvenient. Finally, he said that the Guangdong committees have decided to attend the Sixth Plenary Session and the Fifth National Congress.

<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu issued his personal observations on the British sending Sir Otto Niemeyer to China on the 7th. The general idea of the original text was that Niemeyer's purpose in coming to China was nothing more than to collect debts and make investments. If Britain wants to make new investments in China, it must have a plan to reorganize the old debts. Therefore, debt collection and investment are actually one and two, and two and one. Investments in China by various countries originally required joint action by the four-nation banking consortium of Britain, the United States, Japan, and France. This time, Niemeyer came to China after first consulting with Japan instead of the United States, which is suspicious. In fact, China has never recognized the original loan freedom of the banking consortium. If Britain intends to invest in China, it does not need to worry about the constraints of the banking consortium, or it should first negotiate with the United States. Reports state that Britain wants Japan to understand its actions in China, and Japan hopes that Britain will open its colonies in the East as a condition. It seems that there is little hope for the success of this negotiation. In fact, it is not impossible for Britain to invest in China alone. If the purpose of the investment is to reform the currency system, it will inevitably require the integration of Chinese currency with the British pound. However, Japan will definitely oppose this, because Japan hopes to promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and keep China as an agricultural country and its market. Therefore, there are many problems with whether the central currency loan can be successful. However, from China's perspective, it is impossible to achieve great things empty-handed. If we want rapid economic development, we must use foreign capital. As long as it is based on equality and mutual benefit, the more the better, and it cannot be limited to one country, regardless of which country it is. In short, China must industrialize to become rich. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Literacy Education Should Strive for Further Progress <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Today, when we talk about universal education, we always prioritize literacy. Therefore, those engaged in compilation use statistics to find commonly used characters, and then compile books such as the "Thousand Character Lessons" for application. Those engaged in practice widely promote and call for a literacy movement. Literacy schools are full in the cities, and literacy students are everywhere, even among maids. This is truly a great event, and who would not admire it?</p>
<p>Literacy is a means of relying on, not an ultimate goal. What is the purpose? To use written language as a path to acquire various new knowledge and improve the skills of life. If this premise is recognized by the public, then the previous methods still have room for discussion. I dare to present my views to educators for consideration.</p>
<p>In ancient times, China's language and writing were one sound, one character, and one meaning. Later, as life became more complex, language and writing evolved accordingly. The expression of one meaning often requires two sounds and two characters. Nowadays, this is especially true for written language, whether it is classical or vernacular. Many compound words are used to form meanings. If you look at my text, it does not say "rely" but "rely on". It does not say "end" but "ultimate". In the vernacular, the single character "stone" is not enough, so it must be "stone head". The single character "time" is not enough, so it must be "time when." Grammarians have established a name, regardless of single or compound characters, that refers to the entire word that forms a meaning as a single unit.</p>
<p>If we do not ignore the above facts, then the statistics used to identify commonly used characters, whether it is one thousand or two thousand, are not a precise method. This is because the same character combines with other characters to form various compound words, and their meanings are often very different. Now, regardless of what the words are, only the number of times the characters appear is counted. How can it be said to be precise to determine whether they are common or rare based on the number of times they appear? For example, "entrust" and "details" are clearly two unrelated words. However, if you only look at the single characters, the character "entrust" appears twice. Also, the characters "wind," "horse," and "cow" are all commonly seen nouns, and there is no doubt that they are commonly used. However, when combined to say "wind, horse, cow," the number of times they appear cannot be counted together with the commonly seen "wind horse" and "cow." In just these two examples, it is already clear that the so-called commonly used vocabulary is not reliable. It is inevitable that compiling books based on it will have the drawbacks of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. This is what must be realized.</p>
<p>However, statistics are valuable, but they must be used properly. If, instead of focusing on individual characters, we focus on words and analyze various common newspapers and periodicals sentence by sentence to see which words are commonly used and which are rare, the result will be a common vocabulary. Compiling books based on this common vocabulary will naturally allow students to become familiar with the meanings and uses of the words, making reading and writing both convenient. For example, if "entrust" and "details" are both commonly used, then both must be learned and none abandoned. With a slight shift in focus, the effect will be greatly different. Based on past performance, most people have not paid attention to this. Therefore, I am specifically proposing this in the hope that everyone will change course.</p>
<p>After determining the commonly used vocabulary, if the purpose of teaching is focused on teaching students this commonly used vocabulary, the results will still be limited. The "Thousand Character Lessons" and other books in the past were focused on the transmission of characters. Their compilation was based on embedding characters as the main goal, and the interest was dull. It was often not taken into account. I have heard that students in literacy schools dropped out without finishing their studies because reading was as tasteless as chewing wax. Those who force themselves to complete their studies, is it certain that they will always be associated with characters, read newspapers and periodicals at any time for the benefit of knowledge and skills? It is also questionable. If reading books is not enjoyable, there will only be a gradual alienation, eventually returning to the original state of not knowing or reading. Therefore, the teaching materials must focus on arousing reading interest and developing reading habits. Once this point is clear, the way to express it in commonly used vocabulary is the ideal book and the gift of universal education.</p>
<p>After literacy students finish reading their textbooks and graduate from school, what will they read if they want to use their newly acquired tools to gain more knowledge and skills? The answer must be various popular reading materials. However, I have observed popular reading materials published in the market. The attitude of compiling them is often not appropriate. The compilers seem to think that hungry people are easy to feed, and thirsty people are easy to drink. People who only know a few characters are like hungry and thirsty people. There is no need to serve them delicacies and sweet springs at first. Giving them coarse grains and muddy water is already far better than nothing. However, they do not know that knowledge and skills only seek to benefit life, and the enjoyment of knowledge and skills has absolutely no class distinction. Those who have never known characters before have had their path to knowledge and skills blocked, which is truly a hardship. Now that we are discussing literacy, we should taste fine products and expand their new lives. Therefore, the compilation of popular reading materials should be as cautious as specialized writing. For all the subjects that the general public urgently wants to access, the most accurate and complete materials should be compiled into books to meet the needs of the public. What must be paid attention to in terms of writing is that all writing should be based on commonly used vocabulary. This will make it easy for readers to understand, and they will have the joy of reading with ease. On the other hand, a dictionary should be compiled, and the explanations used should not go beyond the scope of commonly used vocabulary, so that literacy students can use this dictionary to read general newspapers and periodicals without being limited to specially compiled materials. By this point, the entire task of literacy education has been completed, and the goal of universal education has been achieved.</p>
<p>In short, simply making people literate is of little significance. We must make them enthusiastically learn commonly used words, and we must pay attention to the reading interests and habits of the learners. Then, they will be able to apply their literacy. Reading will not be a bitter experience. Finally, we must create a suitable environment for them so that they can use their newly acquired tools to gain knowledge and skills and use them for the rest of their lives, just like food and drink that cannot be lacking. Today, the call to eliminate illiteracy is resounding, and literacy schools have been established everywhere. If those in charge pay a little attention to my words and strive for further progress in compiling books and teaching, the results may be even more impressive.</p>
<h3 id="e44">League of Nations Administrative Council Approves Report, Satisfied with China's Anti-Drug Achievements, Over 81,000 Opium Addicts Quit Their Habits, Still Deeply Hope for Cooperation from Neighboring Countries to Facilitate Progress <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council's meeting tonight has approved the report of the twentieth session of the Opium Committee, including China's anti-drug situation. During the meeting, the rapporteur reported, stating that the committee and the Administrative Council were extremely pleased with the achievements of the anti-drug campaign in China, such as the complete prohibition of poppy cultivation in Fujian Province, the crackdown on opium dens in various parts of Sichuan, the reduction of drug production in Yunnan, the responsible officials' vigorous implementation of universal education, and the widespread establishment of drug rehabilitation centers, which enabled more than 81,000 opium addicts to quit their habits. These are the most prominent achievements. However, the speed of China's anti-drug achievements does not mean that China's anti-drug work is not arduous or has no difficulties. In fact, the scale of this work and the difficulty of implementation are rare. The Administrative Council admires the efforts of the Chinese government and hopes that it will continue to make progress and elevate the entire people to a state of well-being. In this regard, the Chinese representative has repeatedly emphasized that the progress of China's anti-opium campaign depends on the cooperation of various countries, especially neighboring countries. Therefore, the Administrative Council is very pleased with the Japanese representative and some members of the committee's expression of their government's willingness to cooperate with China in increasing the penalties for drug traffickers. It also hopes that China can provide the League of Nations with more detailed reports on the secret manufacture and trafficking of drugs within China. Although China has banned the import of drugs, a large amount of raw opium is still imported from Iran. Therefore, the committee hopes that the Iranian government should promptly ratify the 1912 Hague Convention and the 1925 Geneva Convention. The Administrative Council is also pleased to note that the Iranian representative said that the Iranian government is considering promptly ratifying these conventions.

<h3 id="e45">Movement for Compromise on Economic Conflicts, Britain and Japan Prepare for Negotiations, Japanese Commercial Counselor Matsuyama Returns Home to Negotiate, Sir Otto Niemeyer Goes to Nikko to Meet with British Ambassador <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuyama Shinjiro, the Commercial Counselor stationed in Britain, returned to Japan yesterday from Britain. He said that Japanese industry has recently developed significantly, and Japanese goods have conquered the world market. Therefore, conflicts have arisen with British goods, which have always dominated the world market, leading to the breakdown of the negotiations to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. However, Britain is most eager to cooperate with Japan. The British government sent Sir Otto Niemeyer to China, and his temporary stay in Japan also had its intentions. Niemeyer's mission has two aspects: one is to study the reform of China's finances and inspect the current situation and future prospects of British investment in China; the other mission is to study how to cooperate with Japan. Britain has recently realized that it is gradually retreating from the Far East, but it has invested heavily in China's railways, canals, etc. in the past few decades, so it is now striving to find ways to ensure its vested interests. Britain also intends to lend money to China, but it does not want to implement this alone, because Britain knows that only after Anglo-Japanese cooperation can it implement its China policy. Also, regarding the world market issue, Britain has no certainty of solely dominating the world market. Therefore, if Japan proposes any conditions that are beneficial to Britain, the Anglo-Japanese commercial relationship can be satisfactorily resolved. The important issues that I am returning to the country this time to discuss with the Foreign Minister and the financial community are also related to this point.

<p>(Tokyo) Sir Otto Niemeyer and his wife left Tokyo for Nikko at 8:00 AM on the 7th to stay temporarily at the British Ambassador's villa. After meeting with British Ambassador Clive to discuss official business, they are scheduled to return to Tokyo on the 9th to begin negotiations with the Japanese authorities.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of adjusting trade relations between Japan and Canada, the Canadian Prime Minister submitted a note from the Canadian side to Minister Kato on the 4th. Its contents were sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telegram on the 6th. Therefore, the Countermeasures are being discussed with the Trade Bureau as the center. However, in order to clarify the impropriety of the Canadian attitude, a statement was issued on the afternoon of the 7th in the form of a statement from the authorities, that is, Canada refuted the Japanese note of August 18th in the form of a reply as follows: (1) The Canadian exchange guarantee tax is not a discriminatory treatment against Japan. (2) After Japan implemented the Trade Protection Law, imposing a 50% additional tax on Canada is a violation of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, or even Canada's cancellation of the application of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, etc., are coercive attitudes. Therefore, Japan is determined to refute it. (7th Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on Canada is as follows: (1) The adjustment of trade issues between Japan and Canada originated from Canada's improper prevention of the import of Japanese goods. The Japanese government has repeatedly pointed out Canada's attitude, saying that it protects the interests of Canadian workers by 10%, while the disadvantages to consumers reach 90%. (2) Before the Imperial Government implemented the Trade Protection Law, it had proposed an agreement to increase the tariffs on items in advance, but Canada refused it, which shows that Canada has no sincerity in this issue. (3) Canada uses the excuse of low exchange rates, but the benefits of low exchange rates have been offset by the increase in the price of imported raw materials, and Canada has undervalued the market price of exchange rates. (7th Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan has appropriately implemented the Trade Protection Law on Canadian goods. The Canadian government has added an additional 30% tax on the import of Japanese goods as a countermeasure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Trade Bureau has ordered Minister Kato to negotiate with the Canadian government. According to Minister Kato's report yesterday, the Canadian government's attitude is quite tough. If Japan does not abolish the 50% additional tax, it will decide to abolish the application of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation to Canada. Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering countermeasures, it believes that the Canadian government's tough attitude is a countermeasure for the Canadian parliamentary elections to be held this autumn. In other words, from the current state of trade between Japan and Canada, the party affected by the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation's application to Canada is the Canadian side, and Japan's impact is very slight, so it is optimistic.

<p>(New York) There is no information on the details of the gentleman's agreement between the United States and Japan to limit the export of Japanese cotton loans to the United States.

<h3 id="e47">US Trade with China Greatly Reduced in the First Half of This Year <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce released a report today stating that the total value of US trade with China in July of this year was US$2,251,000, while in July of last year it was US$6,861,000. In the first seven months of this year, the total value of US goods exported to China was US$24,919,000, while in the same period last year it was US$44,807,000. In July of this year, the value of US goods imported from China was US$6,262,000, while in July of last year it was US$4,004,000. In the first seven months of this year, the total value of US goods imported from China was US$36,602,000, while in the same period last year it was US$28,722,000. This year, US trade with the US is in a surplus position, which is actually caused by the US purchasing a large amount of silver from China. Furthermore, in the first half of last year, China purchased a total of 778,220 dan of cotton, of which 272,889 dan were purchased from the United States. In the same period this year, China purchased 405,263 dan of cotton, of which 200,460 dan were purchased from the United States. In the first half of last year, China purchased 17,665,000 kilograms of tobacco leaves from the US. In the same period this year, it only purchased 3,883,000 kilograms. (6th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) US trade with China has decreased. According to officials from the Department of Agriculture, this is actually due to the decline in China's purchasing power and the increase in China's domestic cotton production. It is found that the total cotton exports of all countries in the world in the first half of this year are only half of that in the same period last year, but the percentage occupied by the United States has not changed. As for the decline in tobacco exports, the reason is also the decline in China's purchasing power. In addition, Chinese tobacco merchants previously purchased too much stock when prices were low, which is also one of the reasons. As for wheat, the United States itself does not subsidize exports. There is no expectation for US trade with China before there is a major improvement in the domestic situation in China. (6th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the Department of Commerce, the total value of silver imported into the United States in the week before August 30 was $3,116,000. In the previous week, it was $6,492,000. Among them, Mexico supplied $1,866,000, Canada supplied $521,000, Peru $193,000, and the United Kingdom $380,000. This time, no silver was purchased from China or Hong Kong. This figure shows that the high tide of US silver purchases has subsided, because the purchased silver is all from major silver producing countries. That is, the amount purchased is very small compared to the $14,604,000 imported in the week before August 9. The total value of silver exported this time reached $559,000, of which $500,000 was shipped to Honduras. (6th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) During the week ending September 4, British silver exports increased slightly compared to the previous week, while imports increased greatly. The total value of exports was £1,524,000, an increase of £50,000 compared to the previous week. The amount shipped to the United States this week was £1,515,000, an increase of £61,000 compared to the previous week. British silver imports this week were valued at £1,751,000, an increase of £1,164,000 compared to the previous week. The total value came from Japan was £322,000, Belgium £25,000, Hong Kong £1,259,000, France £44,000, India £21,000, and French Somaliland £20,000. This week's silver trade surplus was £127,000, while last week's surplus was £887,000. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Roosevelt Halts New Deal, Opinions Vary, A Prelude to the Presidential Election Campaign <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Opinions vary in commercial and political circles on the letters exchanged between President Roosevelt and H. L. Howard. Franklin, chairman of the Republican Central Committee, expressed his opinion that the president has issued new promises to begin the 1936 election campaign. Knox, the manager of the Chicago Daily News, said that the facts are all there, and it is not enough for Roosevelt to restore the people's faith with empty words. Massachusetts Governor Curley praised the letter and predicted that Roosevelt would be re-elected. Senator Norris said that the letter was well-worded. After reading the letter, Chicago capitalist Rice Gower said, "If we praise this letter highly, we predict that Roosevelt will be re-elected. Senator Norris said that the letter was well-worded. After reading the letter, Chicago capitalist Rice Gower said, "From a spiritual point of view, this letter is important." Glaser, the manager of Otis Steel Company, said, "It is difficult to say whether the President's promise can compensate for past losses." (6th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) Banks have a very good impression of President Roosevelt's letter to Howard discussing the New Deal, and they regard it as a symbol of its continued drift to the right. However, most businessmen do not want to express criticism until they are familiar with the trend in Washington. Williamson, the manager of the New York Central Railroad, commented that commercial opportunities for relief are the current top priority. This policy should help commerce. Economist Edie declared that if he can guarantee that the recovery plan has indeed stopped, it will be a great relief for the commercial sector. Retailers are more skeptical, saying that if waste continues, the future is unpredictable. It is always difficult to trust the words of politicians, and they are deeply afraid that they will still give us little relief in the future. Connaught, the president of the Merchants Association, commented on the matter at the request of reporters, saying, "I still believe that the tax bill is a mistake, and its impact is very harmful. But we are willing to hear promises that can give us relief. This statement should help commerce." (6th National News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) Wall Street attaches great importance to President Roosevelt's statement that his basic recovery program has been completed and that the business community now has a chance to breathe. The business community breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this. However, some quarters said that what the business community needs is not only a chance to breathe, but also a balanced budget, reduced taxes, and lower living costs before there can be a real recovery. Few officials in Washington admit that Roosevelt is prepared to relinquish the temporary emergency powers granted to him by Congress in a short period of time. However, the figure in the business world said that Roosevelt's remarks were intended to create an atmosphere of trust before the 1936 election. The stock market showed a lively atmosphere after hearing Roosevelt's statistics. Many Democrats have expressed dissatisfaction that the ongoing rapid reforms have suddenly been suspended, but Republicans feel that this is still not thorough. Only by balancing the budget can there be hope for recovery. Knox, the media tycoon in Chicago who once campaigned as a Republican candidate for president, claimed that Roosevelt's remarks were just another promise and would only be important if they were reliable.

<h3 id="e49">The League of Nations Forms a Five-Nation Committee; Italy Suddenly Expresses Approval; Invokes Article Fifteen of the Covenant for Handling; Abyssinia Also Replaces Representative <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Last night, during a League of Nations Council meeting, the heated speech of Abyssinian representative Professor Jidji caused the Italian representative Roja to angrily leave the session. This matter has now been resolved. The Abyssinian government agreed today to appoint Ambassador Hawariat, the Abyssinian ambassador to Paris, as the chief representative to the League of Nations meetings, with Professor Jidji as his deputy. It is said that this measure can satisfy Italy, as Italy opposed Jidji because he was not Abyssinian and disliked his sharp tongue. At the same time, a compromise has been reached regarding the formation of a five-person special committee to handle the Italo-Abyssinian dispute in accordance with Article Fifteen of the League of Nations Covenant. After being pressured by Britain and France, Italy no longer insists that the Italian side should also send a representative to join the committee. The committee is now composed of British representative Eden, French representative Laval, Spanish representative Madariaga, Polish representative Beck, and Turkish representative Aras. This afternoon, when the Council met, the Abyssinian representative entered the meeting, and the Italian representative Aloisi left in protest. The Council then appointed this five-person special committee. After that, the Council discussed matters unrelated to the Abyssinian case, and Aloisi returned to the meeting.</p>
<p>The special committee held a short meeting tonight, electing Madariaga as chairman and deciding to hold its first important meeting at 10:30 tomorrow morning. The procedures for today have not yet been finalized, but it is expected that Eden and Laval will be authorized to negotiate with Aloisi. However, the committee will of course need to contact both Italy and Abyssinia. It is widely believed that Italy is now prepared to accept the proposals put forward at the Paris conference as a basis for discussion, but it must be a starting point and not a final conclusion. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Nation Committee has earnestly appealed to both Italy and Abyssinia not to take actions that could jeopardize the success of the committee's mediation efforts. The committee then held a short meeting, attended by all five representatives. After the meeting, Laval immediately returned to Paris, presumably to confer with President Lebrun and other cabinet members. Laval is scheduled to return to Geneva on September 10th.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Mussolini has assured Laval that Italy will not resort to force while the Geneva talks are in progress. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday's newspapers clearly expressed disappointment with the situation in Geneva. Now that the Five-Nation Committee has been established, the tone has become more optimistic. Le Matin's headline was "The Calming of the Storm," stating that while Italy's attitude is more moderate and no longer resolutely opposes the inclusion of Britain and France in the Five-Nation Committee, the dispute is still far from being resolved. Le Journal stated that the establishment of the Five-Nation Committee is the first victory for the international community, and this victory is due to the efforts of Prime Minister Laval. The Geneva correspondent of the French semi-official news agency stated that the British and French foreign ministries have been drafting new proposals for several weeks, which may resolve the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. The solutions contained therein are broadly similar to those governing the relationship between Britain and Iraq, and will be submitted to the Five-Nation Committee today by Laval and Eden. The relationship between Britain and Iraq is based on the following two principles: (1) Britain recognizes Iraq's independence and the sovereignty of its King; (2) Iraq recognizes Britain's right to station troops and participate in Iraq's army and police. If this approach can be adopted for Italo-Abyssinian relations, then the arbitrary border management laws discussed during the Paris tripartite talks may be merged. However, the correspondent warned that this plan can only be realized if the outbreak of war is prevented. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Rumors of Another Meeting Between Britain, France, and Italy; The Italian Political World Embraces This Hope <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Rome is rather pessimistic about the efforts of the Five-Nation Special Committee appointed by the League of Nations Council. Paris is now considering a plan to hold a new meeting between Britain, France, and Italy to replace it. According to Le Temps, the new meeting may still be held in Stresa. In April of this year, the three countries met there after Germany rearmed to discuss the policies to be pursued in Europe. The newspaper also stated that if the current plan can be realized, Mussolini wants Britain to be represented by Baldwin and Hoare, and France by Laval. L'Observateur in Paris believes that the Italo-Abyssinian dispute may be resolved through a human solution, allowing Italy to occupy a position in Abyssinia, as Britain does in Iraq. It is said that Italy will implement Abyssinia's police and administrative affairs, while Abyssinia will remain a member of the League of Nations. It is also said that Mussolini has sent a large army to East Africa, which can be used to conquer the border provinces that refuse to agree to this solution, so as to avoid the army being idle. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures have not abandoned hope of resolving the Abyssinian affair, but believe that the various plans currently being discussed in Geneva cannot be accepted. The hope for a final resolution lies in informal talks between the countries concerned, as this kind of informal talk often produces effective results, which is generally recognized. The main problem at present lies in the principles on which the various proposals put forward so far are based. One of these principles advocates that Britain, France, and Italy, together with Abyssinia, should jointly conclude a treaty in order to seek a thorough solution. However, Italian political figures believe that if this principle is agreed to, it will be a step backward compared to the 1906 tripartite treaty, which demarcated the spheres of influence of Britain, France, and Italy in Abyssinia without consulting Abyssinia beforehand. Now, it is desired to have Abyssinia conclude a treaty jointly with Britain, France, and Italy, which is naturally difficult for Italy to accept. In addition, political figures stated that what Italy is asking for is to govern the entire territory of Abyssinia, similar to Britain's governance of the African mandated territory of Tanganyika. However, this has not been accepted by all parties so far. In any case, the possibility of reaching an agreement outside the League of Nations mechanism has not disappeared. It is generally believed that it would be easier to reach an agreement if the foreign affairs officials of the countries concerned were to negotiate directly. If Italian Foreign Minister Mussolini, French Foreign Minister Laval, and British Foreign Secretary Hoare could meet together, it would be very helpful in resolving this issue. Therefore, political figures generally believe that the Stresa conference format may be adopted again. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, Britain's attitude towards the Abyssinian affair is based on the following three wishes: (1) to give Italy the opportunity to boost its prestige in Abyssinia and obtain psychological satisfaction in the short term; (2) to impose sanctions on Italy at the request of British public opinion, but not to have Italy regard these sanctions as an act of war; (3) to uphold the principles of the League of Nations. These are the wishes recently expressed by London financial circles, and it seems that responsible parties have also adopted this view. Therefore, the fact that Prime Minister Baldwin first received Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain yesterday is noteworthy. It is believed that if Britain and Italy were to clash, the damage to the world economy and the British economy would be significant. It is said that for the sake of Italy's prestige, Italy's expedition to Abyssinia is inevitable. Therefore, it is advocated that if Italian troops attack Adowa in Abyssinia, most of the Abyssinian troops should retreat to avoid a large-scale conflict with the Italian army. Once the Italian army wins a great victory, it can then carry out police-like actions within Abyssinia without engaging in a real war. As for the issue of sanctions, if Britain only prohibits the shipment of arms to Italy or allows the shipment of arms to Abyssinia, Italy may not immediately regard it as an act of war. If so, then after the Italian army wins a great victory at Adowa, wiping out the shame of 1896 and greatly enhancing its prestige, it will not be difficult for Britain to negotiate directly with Mussolini to finalize the matter. In addition, Foreign Secretary Hoare will go to Geneva to attend the 16th General Assembly of the League of Nations. Political figures are eagerly hoping for Hoare's speech at the General Assembly of the League of Nations, because this speech will surely shed new light on the Abyssinian issue. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Senator Dumont expressed his opinion in the Economic News, advocating that the world's colonies should be reconsidered and redistributed. This proposal has now aroused heated discussions among prominent figures in Britain and the United States. Dumont first stated that the Kellogg-Briand Pact has stipulated that countries should not resort to war over the struggle for raw materials, but it is almost impossible to prevent countries with high birth rates and limited raw material resources from risking war. However, according to Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, this issue really needs to be considered, that is, whether the current distribution of colonies, with some having too much and others having too little, is reasonable. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers today published editorials, stating that the opinions of the representatives in Geneva are consistent, and that Britain and France are now becoming increasingly united. Several newspapers warned the Italian government that it would be futile to confront the united and determined League of Nations alone. Le Petit Parisien stated that Italy should realize that the League of Nations is still a vigorous organization, and that the great powers are determined to respect international law, no matter how great the price. L'Écho de Paris believes that the status of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has changed very little, but stated that it is now extremely obvious that Laval has abandoned his role as mediator and is leaning towards Britain. If so, then Italy's claims will inevitably be hit hard. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian government issued a lengthy statement yesterday criticizing the decision of the Italo-Abyssinian Mediation Committee, stating that the Walwal incident has now been resolved. This incident caused the current Italo-Abyssinian dispute and Italy's military preparations, but the Italo-Abyssinian problem remains because Italy refuses to seek reconciliation in accordance with the treaty. Since Abyssinia is a member of the League of Nations, it requests the League of Nations to abide by the resolution of August 4 this year, to adopt methods to resolve all disputes, to maintain peace, and not to adopt important principles that undermine the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of members. It is Italy that is hindering the demarcation of the border between Somalia and Abyssinia. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>London The official is very concerned about what kind of reaction the British dominions have to the implementation of sanctions when Italy attacks Abyssinia. In particular, the British government is paying close attention to the recent resolution passed by the Pretoria Chamber of Commerce, the capital of the Union of South Africa, requesting the government to protect the status quo of African territory. As far as the current situation is concerned, the attitudes of the British dominions can be roughly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Canada Canadian Prime Minister Bennett recently declared that the Canadian government's responsibility lies in preventing Canada from being drawn into the vortex of international disputes. However, Bennett's declaration may not have any effect, because the current Conservative government of Canada may soon be overthrown, and the claims of Liberal Party leader Mackenzie King are diametrically opposed to Bennett's. As for Canada's general public opinion, it does not seem to object to implementing sanctions and strengthening the effectiveness of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>(2) Australia Australian public opinion is not as divided on the Italo-Abyssinian issue as the other dominions. Australian Conservative Prime Minister Lyons and Social Democratic former Prime Minister Lang both oppose sanctions. However, the Australian Cabinet recently decided to support the British government's Geneva policy as much as possible. In addition, Australian public opinion generally supports maintaining the effectiveness of the League of Nations Covenant, but does not support the implementation of sanctions, because it fears that it will lead to war.</p>
<p>(3) Union of South Africa The three states of the Union of South Africa are all in full agreement with the strict implementation of the League of Nations Covenant, for three reasons: first, it fears that it will cause racial conflict in Africa. The conflict between colored and white people in Africa has been painstakingly eliminated, and it should not be allowed to revive now; second, because South Africans believe that fulfilling international obligations is morally very important; third, because of anti-fascist demonstrations by the South African labor class. The recent strike by South African dockworkers to refuse to load meat and ship it to East Africa to supply Italian troops is one example.</p>
<p>(4) New Zealand and Newfoundland These two regions will always support British policy, regardless of what it is.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the attitudes of the British dominions are quite different, but the British government will probably act alone and will not take into account the opinions of the various dominions, because the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is more important to Europe and has little to do with the entire British Empire.

<p>Ottawa Canadian Prime Minister Bennett made a broadcast speech tonight. While engaged in the federal election campaign, he declared that dangers are imminent, but the fault lies with others, not with us. I feel that the government should use all fair and honorable means to keep Canada out of it. This is the government's solemn responsibility. Canada knows very well the dangers of the international situation. In world politics, Canada should focus on security, because Canada has no ambition that peace cannot hope for. Canada has paid the price for safety and peace and has purchased it. We must now keep it from being lost. We should stay away from any foreign disputes that do not involve Canada's rights.

<p>Tsuruga According to a telegram from Vladivostok, the Soviet government plans to fill the Tatar Strait between North Sakhalin Island and the coastal province. A committee has now been organized to investigate the tidal currents and the silting condition of the Amur River. The closest part of the land on both sides of the Tatar Strait is near the Laba Peninsula, with only two miles between the two shores and a depth of only four or five feet. Therefore, the project is not difficult. If the strait is filled, it can prevent the cold currents from the north along the coastal province, and fog will not occur, and the northeastern part of Japan can also be spared from the cold.

<p>Zhenjiang Report: Jiangsu Province has previously abolished three batches of local excessive and miscellaneous taxes in various counties, totaling over 328,000 yuan annually. Now, for the fourth batch of taxes to be abolished, the Finance Department has sent a letter to the Jiangsu Province Tax Supervision Bureau, forwarding the survey registers from 48 counties to the department for review. It is estimated that over 590,000 yuan have already been automatically abolished in the fourth batch. Together with the previous three batches, this amounts to over 900,000 yuan, accounting for 80% of the originally planned total abolition amount. Furthermore, offsetting measures have been incorporated into the review of county budgets and the streamlining of financial plans, effectively tightening expenditures or finding ways to consolidate revenues. Without waiting for the central government to allocate subsidies, the burden on the people has been reduced. The remaining 190,000 yuan of the fourth batch of taxes to be abolished cannot be offset, and the Ministry of Finance has been requested to allocate the required amount from the stamp tax revenue. Implementation can commence once the Ministry allocates the funds. As for the remaining twelve counties, further review and abolition will be carried out after the Tax Supervision Bureau completes its survey.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>(33) The Issue of Women's Military Training</p>
<p>The women of Guangdong and Guangxi are the bravest and most active. Traveling west from Guangzhou into Guangxi, the active state of the working women seen along the way becomes more and more pronounced. Most of the women in Guangxi Province have considerable occupations, and their ability to handle affairs is almost completely equal to that of men, or even surpasses it. All agencies and schools have female staff, dressed in men's clothing, wearing ordinary gray cloth uniforms, and military caps, with the spirit of warriors. Middle schools and elementary schools are co-educational, and men and women swim in the same swimming pool. The authorities are extremely open-minded, and no adverse incidents have been discovered. In rural areas, men and women are even more equal. Both sides operate in the same way. The reporter traveled more than 5,000 miles back and forth on various highways by car. In the villages passed, women carrying babies on their backs, shouldering loads weighing more than a hundred catties, wearing large bamboo hats, black shirts and trousers, barefoot, and straw sandals were everywhere. Fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girls, barefoot, were carrying water, herding cattle, or transplanting rice seedlings, as active as boys. It is said that men in Guangxi are lazy and indulge in gambling, often losing everything they earn in one throw. The wives, on the other hand, are frugal and thrifty, holding the economic power of the family. Jokers say that they can afford to keep three wives and four concubines, distribute them to seek food and work, while they themselves sit back and direct, and in a few years, they can become wealthy and harmful old men. Hence, the occupation of women in Guangxi is entirely based on labor skills to obtain remuneration, unlike women in certain provinces who are heavily made up and dressed up, only to be criticized as mere vases. Guangxi can truly implement gender equality. Since the environment for men and women in Guangxi is based on this truly equal principle, since the implementation of universal military training, the regulations stipulate that women should be trained in first aid techniques due to their physical strength and special physiological characteristics, but most female students above the middle school level have volunteered to undergo military training. The school authorities praised their aspirations and allowed them to join. The reporter visited Mr. Liang Hansong, commander of the militia district. Mr. Liang said that when the first phase of military training was held, many women asked to participate. Their reason was that men and women each account for half of the country. In the past, women's demands for participation in political power were all false because women did not participate in military affairs and economy. How could they participate in politics? Therefore, they first requested to participate in military training and share the hardships with men, and then they would have the opportunity to participate in politics. What he said was very true. Therefore, the authorities decided that starting next year, they would officially allow women to participate in military training and be treated the same as men. After completing training at the Militia Cadre School, they can be assigned as village chiefs and principals of elementary schools, and then gradually promoted according to qualifications and merits. That is to say, female village chiefs, county magistrates, and other local officials will soon be commonly seen in Guangxi.</p>
<p>(34) Conditions in Villages and Townships with Militias</p>
<p>Those who visited the militia command of the Wuming-Nanning District included, in addition to the reporter, legislators Wang Kunlun and Lin Suyuan, and several academic members. They had lunch at the district headquarters. After the meal, Commander Liang accompanied them on a tour of the various buildings in the headquarters for a week, including improved livestock farms, stables, houses for cattle, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc., which were extremely clean, as well as agricultural experimental fields, where various fruits and trees were planted. The large playground, hospital, and education room occupied a vast area. In addition to training militia cadre personnel, it also taught farmers attached to the area to improve agricultural work. Then, they took cars to visit the lower-level militia situation in the nearby Chaojie Village. The entire village had only dozens of households. The village office was located at the site of an old land temple, which had been slightly repaired and rebuilt. It was attached to a national basic elementary school with more than 20 students. The village chief and principal was a young man in his twenties. He converted the old land hall into a living room with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging above it. On both walls were charts showing the number of households and educated people. Another chart detailed the amount of public property in the entire village, such as rural warehouses, village forests, village fields, village farmlands, public houses, village orchards, and other items, with detailed figures below each. According to Mr. Liang, the village warehouses, etc., belong to the public property of the entire village, so that the strength of group cooperation can be used to develop the rural economy and implement the militia's rural self-sufficiency policy. Regarding village fields, orchards, etc., the cultivation and management work is entirely a voluntary labor system. For example, each person contributes two workdays per month. With 300 people in the whole village, there are 600 workdays per month. All farmers aged 18 to 50 must respond to the call. In the future, the harvest of agricultural products will be included in the rural public warehouse. The village chief's salary is only 10 to 15 yuan per month, and they can be re-elected for two years. It is also stipulated that a certain percentage of the prosperity of the public warehouse will be used as a reward for the village chief's efforts, so their lives are still sufficient to maintain, and they can do their best to develop public interests, etc. Most of the people in the village have the surname Lu, and the village chief is also named Lu. To the right of the village office is a public entertainment place, which was also rebuilt from a temple. According to the village chief, the temple idols in various villages have been cleared one after another. At first, the village women complained about worshiping idols, but after explanation, they were able to understand. When the militia was first established, many villagers were also skeptical and watched, but after the village chiefs and others set an example, they now know that the militia is beneficial to the farmers themselves and actively participate, etc. After leaving Zhaojie Village, they went to nearby villages along the road. They saw militiamen with guns standing guard, brave and strong, in high spirits, washing away the shame of the "Sick Man of East Asia." Finally, they went to Wenjiang Pagoda, which was built during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Located in the center of nearby villages, the militia lookout post was placed on the highest level of the pagoda. Before we left the command, Commander Liang had ordered the cannons to be fired to gather the militia for exercises. When we climbed the lookout tower to look out, militiamen were heading in teams on various roads from afar and had already gathered in the square. We also rushed over. The field could accommodate tens of thousands of people and was a natural training ground. A mat shed was erected in the middle as a command post. About a thousand militiamen were concentrated, and the team was very prosperous. Then the guests, at the invitation of Commander Liang, gave speeches in succession, mostly encouraging. At about 3 o'clock, the reporters and others left with satisfaction. On the way back, we saw militiamen working in groups of three or five, doing voluntary work, either building roads or planting, diligently working, it can be said that they are truly working for the public good.</p>
<p>(35) General Overview of Border Militias</p>
<p>Longzhou is the center of border defense. Initially, there was a stationed division. Since the establishment of the militia, universal military training has been gradually completed in the countryside, and the border defense has become more stable. The stationed army has been transferred to Bose in batches to prevent and suppress border communists. Only two regiments are currently stationed in Longzhou. Li Pinxian, the border defense supervisor and simultaneous anti-corruption supervisor, also serves as the commander of the Longzhou District Militia, the principal of the Republic Cadre School, and the administrative supervisor. Regarding the situation of the border defense militia, Mr. Li told the reporter that the regular teams in various counties have been established since 1931. The training period for each term is six months. After the term expires, they are discharged from the army. All books, pens, ink, and paper are prepared by the soldiers of each regiment themselves. In addition to regular classes, they are also made to learn planting, animal husbandry, gardening, and other things, in order to cultivate their production skills. After the training period expires, personnel are sent to inspect and fill in the scores of each subject, and a certificate is issued upon application. Those who fail must make up their studies for a certain period of time. After graduation, they are assigned to the reserve team. The standing team was discontinued in October 1933. From the beginning of the establishment to the end, a total of three terms were trained, and the number of discharged personnel was more than 3,740. The reserve team was established in 1932. The training period was initially 120 hours, and later increased to 180 hours with the addition of air defense, poison gas defense, and fire prevention. Due to geographical and soldier living conditions, the time can be changed as appropriate, but it must deduct a full 180 hours of training and not hinder the people's livelihood. After the term expires, personnel are sent to inspect, and those who pass are issued certificates. From July to December 1932, the first term was trained. From January to June 1933, the second term was trained. From July to December 1933, the third term was trained. From March to August 1934, the fourth term of the urban area was trained. From September 1934 to February 1935, the fourth term of the rural area was trained. From March 1935 to the present, the fifth term has been trained. Up to the fourth term, each county has trained a total of 338 reserve teams, with a total of 32,799 soldiers. After the standing team was discontinued, the original funds were changed to run a cadre training brigade. The number of personnel is the same as that of the standing team. The purpose is to train lower-level cadres of the Republic by slightly adjusting the incumbent village chiefs and other personnel to the team. The training period is eight months. After graduation, they return to serve as village chiefs and simultaneously serve as the reserve team leader, elementary school principal, or teacher. Up to the fourth term last year, the number of village chiefs in the Longzhou District who received training totaled 1,402, of which 1,029 have graduated. The Longzhou District Militia Cadre School was also established this spring. Incumbent village chiefs and graduates of Longzhou Middle School are sent to receive training. Longzhou is surrounded by mountains, sparsely populated, and close to the tropics, with rampant malaria. In recent years, transportation has gradually become more convenient, and roads on various lines have been completed one after another. It takes eight hours to reach Longzhou from Nanning by car along the highway. By water, it takes two or three days in high water and seven or eight days in shallow water. For aviation, there is the Guangzhou-Longzhou line, which flies from Guangzhou via Wuzhou and Nanning to Longzhou and can be reached in one day, making travel convenient. Merchants are also gradually converging. Guangxi Province pays great attention to health and administrative construction, and sends personnel to Longzhou to conduct research and treatment. Epidemics have been greatly reduced. It will further encourage immigration. On the one hand, due to the successful organization of the militia, bandits have disappeared, and people live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, the future development of the Longzhou District can be predicted, and border defense should also be consolidated.</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Match Industry in Guangdong Province is Declining - Imported Matches are Dumped in the Mainland - Guangdong Manufacturers Request Suspension of the Consolidated Tax <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The match industry in Guangdong Province once prospered, but later, imported matches were dumped, and the made-in-Guangdong matches were greatly affected. Initially, the match market in Southeast Asia was crowded out by foreign matches, and sales were cut off. Gradually, the place where matches were manufactured in this province was also invaded by foreign matches. As a result, Guangdong match factories were hit hard and closed down one after another. From hundreds of factories, there are more than ten factories left. To this day, their business is still sluggish and they are on the verge of self-preservation. Match merchants convened meetings on August 26 and 30 to request the Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi Consolidated Tax Bureau to exempt the consolidated tax on matches and simultaneously request the tax bureau to order inspectors to strictly investigate privately imported foreign matches to prevent the dumping of foreign goods. At the last collective discussion, the Consolidated Tax Bureau put forward its opinion that foreign matches are sold for only more than three yuan per piece, while domestically produced matches are sold for about ten yuan per piece. Even if more than four yuan and five angles per piece are removed from the consolidated tax and raw material tax, the price of domestically produced matches is still no match for the cheap price of imported matches. It is hoped that the match merchants in this province will fundamentally improve their work, so as to reduce costs. On the one hand, the government should appropriately reduce the consolidated tax in order to compete with foreign products. As for the methods of improving the match industry, there are about a number of points: (1) Rationalize the organization and management of match factories, (2) Rationalize the work of match factories, (3) Improve production technology, (4) Modernize mechanical equipment, (5) Improve the quality of local matches, with the standard of being better than foreign matches, (6) Implement production and sales cooperation, (7) Study the most economical means of purchasing raw materials, (8) Ensure that both labor and management stabilize the business, (9) Improve the knowledge and skills of laborers and their treatment. As a result, match merchants agreed to accept the business improvement plan, but since the current consolidated tax on matches is hindering the vitality of matches made in this province, they requested that the tax be suspended first in order to support the declining industry. The Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau immediately replied that he would ask his superiors to consider it.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Anhui Finance Department is Preparing to Establish a Local Bank - Joint Stock Investment is Solicited, and the Organization is in Accordance with Company Regulations - <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anhui Province has suffered frequent floods and droughts in recent years, as well as banditry. The government's treasury is depleted and difficult to replenish, while the rural areas are declining and industry and commerce are withering. The reason for this is that funds are concentrated in cities, and inland finance is completely stagnant. The only way to remedy this is to rely on an agency that can regulate finance, so that it can be operated flexibly. The Finance Department believes that the establishment of a provincial local bank is the most important plan at present, and in order to unify the collection and payment of various funds in the province and counties, it has planned to establish county treasuries in various counties. This county treasury should also be entrusted to local banks to act as agents nearby. Therefore, it is planned to prepare for the establishment of the Anhui Provincial Local Bank, solicit joint stock investment, and organize it in accordance with company regulations. The main significance of this is described below: (A) Positive aspects: (1) Rescue rural areas, (2) Support all industries and commerce, (3) Act as a treasury to unify revenue and expenditure, (4) Assist in production and construction and other production undertakings, (B) Negative aspects: Absolutely do not use it for political expenses. Based on the above significance, it is planned to complete the organization and actively proceed at the beginning of this year, so that the economic panic in this province can be directly and effectively assisted, and the effectiveness of politics can be improved, and the stability of social order can be relied upon. The key points for handling the agency treasury have been stipulated: A. In order to implement the treasury system in this province, the method of entrusting the bank to act as an agent will be adopted. Provincial treasuries and county treasuries will be established in the places where the provincial government and county governments are located to manage the revenue and expenditure of provincial and county funds. B. The provincial treasury will be entrusted by the provincial government to the bank located in the place to act as its agent. The county treasury will be entrusted by the county government to the bank branch or agency established by the bank acting as the agent of the provincial treasury. C. From the date of being entrusted, the bank branch or agency acting as the agent of the county treasury will collect and pay all provincial and county annual revenues and expenditures, except as otherwise provided by laws, regulations, or contracts. D. The bank branch or agency acting as the agent of the provincial and county treasuries shall store the treasury funds separately from the operating capital, but with the approval of the provincial financial authorities and the county government, a part of the treasury funds may be transferred to deposits, and the deposit interest shall be agreed upon by the bank branch or agency and the financial department and county government. E. The revenue and expenditure of special accounting, except as otherwise provided by laws and regulations, will also be managed by the acting provincial and county treasuries, and boundaries must be drawn to prevent mixing with operating capital revenue and expenditure. F. The Finance Department may send personnel at any time to inspect the provincial and county treasury disaster registers and cash, and the county governments of each county may also send personnel to inspect the county treasury disaster registers and cash on an ad hoc basis. (September 4)</p>

<p>In the tenth Gu of the fifth district, Wu Shi, the widowed daughter-in-law of Wu Guanquan, a villager, was seduced into an adulterous relationship by Wu Guanlin, her husband's uncle, after her husband passed away. This incestuous and beastly act was a scandalous rumor in the village. Unexpectedly, good things rarely last, and she secretly conceived, her abdomen gradually swelling. The adulterer, fearing public criticism, entrusted someone to perform an abortion, intending to eliminate the evidence. However, the midwife's surgery was unsuccessful, damaging her internal organs. Shi died as a result. Afterward, a mediator intervened, and the adulterer paid 530 yuan for a lavish funeral. It is rumored that her father-in-law, considering the matter a case of incest and death, decided to take legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Wuxi: Continued Appeal for Wheat Business Tax <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, based on the previous joint telegram from the flour and rice/bean industries to the ministry and provincial authorities requesting exemption from the temporary business tax on barley, received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday. The reply stated that business tax collected by brokers should be levied from the seller. Flour factories purchasing wheat should be responsible for ensuring that the grain merchants entrusted with the purchase collect and pay the relevant business tax. If the grain merchants use their own capital to buy and sell grain, their own business activities should be subject to business tax. If the manufacturers entrust the purchase to grain merchants, the grain merchants should still be responsible for paying the tax. As for the method of tax collection by brokers, reforms have already been consulted and recorded. If grain brokers who handle buying and selling for customers collect commissions, they should still collect the tax from the seller according to the ministry's previous consultations. The buyer, whether a manufacturer or not, should not be taxed. Upon receiving the telegram, the Chamber of Commerce immediately notified the relevant parties. However, they replied that flour factories buying wheat are not subject to business tax. Rice and bean grain merchants are acting as agents for customers and are already paying a brokerage license fee and a separate business tax. According to Article 10 of the Business Tax Law, the original brokerage tax can be converted to business tax at the original tax rate. Now, the grain merchants in Wuxi are paying both brokerage and business tax, which is an extra burden. If they are also required to collect the temporary business tax on wheat, although it is nominally collected from the seller, it is actually paid by the grain merchants. This contradicts Article 9 of the Business Tax Law, which requires the taxpayer to pay the tax directly. Customers also have an excuse, making it difficult to collect the tax. Given the current slump in the grain market and the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, the local commercial situation is already precarious. Grain merchants are paying both brokerage and business tax, and customers are still requesting exemption. Therefore, they have again telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, continuing to appeal for the immediate suspension of the tax to stabilize the commercial market, after consulting with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Furthermore, the flour factories have declared that, starting from the first of this month, they will directly purchase wheat from the producers and will no longer buy and sell through brokers. However, the rice and bean businesses, because the grain merchants have paid the brokerage license fee, are bound by the regulations regarding measuring tools and cannot operate freely, leading to a stalemate. Therefore, no wheat grains have been purchased in the past week.</p>

<p>There were originally seven commercial ships operating between Shanghai and Haimen: Guangxiang, Baofeng, Baohua, Daxing, Fuxing, Haimen, and Xinrenhe. This spring, the shipping companies jointly organized the Shanghai-Haimen Shipping Cooperative, operating only two ships per shift, in order to monopolize business and raise ticket and freight prices, resulting in overcrowded passengers and goods. Fresh goods such as fruits and fish often rotted due to delayed loading and transportation, causing significant losses to merchants and travelers. The various trade associations in the county jointly petitioned the Ministry of Communications to strictly ban this practice. After receiving the petition, the Ministry of Communications ordered Sun Yongyi, the chief inspector of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, to come to Haimen to investigate (on the 3rd). That afternoon, he convened a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce with the chairmen of various trade associations. Sun expressed dissatisfaction with the shipping companies' monopolistic practices. On the afternoon of the 5th, Sun returned to Shanghai by ship from Niuhong Port to report the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Communications for review.</p>

<p>The Yellow River is overflowing in northern Jiangsu, and Feng, Pi, and Pei counties have been flooded. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau reported that the Hanzhuang radio station has been submerged and cannot communicate. The elevated houses are full of disaster victims, so it is impossible to set up radio equipment. The Canal Engineering Bureau (on the 6th) immediately telegraphed the Huaiyin Canal Area Flood Prevention Office, requesting that the radio station be moved to the Jinpu Railway Station's reporting room, but communication must not be interrupted. The bureau has now received a reply from Huaiyin stating that Hanzhuang will resume communication tomorrow.

<p>In Yaojia, Tingxia Dong Village, in the third district of Fenghua, most of the residents are farmers. Yao Zongshan, a farmer, has always been diligent and frugal and has saved a little money. In August of the 19th year, he was once kidnapped by thieves but managed to escape, avoiding losses. His wife, Zhang, has two daughters and one son. The son is only one year old. Because the second daughter is about to get married, the eldest daughter, who has already married, was brought back to help with everything. Unexpectedly, at 9 o'clock the night before last, six or seven bandits suddenly arrived, each holding firearms and other weapons. They climbed over the walls and entered the house to find the owner and rob him. Zongshan heard the news upstairs and escaped by jumping out of the window. At that time, his wife, Zhang, and eldest daughter were silenced by the thieves and forbidden to make any noise. The bandit saw his young son sleeping on the bed and kidnapped him. The mother and daughter saw their son being kidnapped and grabbed him, refusing to let go, which angered the thieves. They opened fire and shot him dead. The bandits, realizing that they had caused trouble, tried to escape, but were stopped by the second daughter, who was also shot and injured by the bandits. The bullet is still in her abdomen. At the same time, Zhu Qianyun, a neighbor, heard the news and reported a fire to ask for help. He was also shot in the buttocks by the bandits. The thieves then kidnapped the hostage and fled towards Siming Bridge. Afterward, Zongshan returned home and saw his wife and eldest daughter had died tragically, his second daughter and neighbor were injured, and his beloved son was kidnapped. He was in extreme pain. Later, he found a letter left by the bandits in the house, demanding 8,550 yuan as ransom and specifying the address and date for the ransom payment. Zongshan immediately took the letter and reported it to the Dongcun Security Corps to pursue the bandits. Because so much time had passed, the bandits had already fled far away.</p>
<p>Also, in the Nandi and Nanxiang area of Xiangshan, the August opera has been performed for days. Ni Wenfang, a wealthy man in the village, was hosting guests the night before last when more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived, firing more than 20 shots to intimidate. They used stones to knock on the door, but the door could not be broken down. At that time, the guests and family members rushed upstairs to retrieve a gun for self-defense, but the gun had not been used for a long time, and the barrel was rusted and could not be fired. Ni's wife, in desperation, grabbed her son and jumped from the upstairs, suffering serious injuries. In the midst of the chaos, Yang, a former保衛　丁, heard the alarm and rushed to Ni's house to get a gun, but was seen by the bandits, who shot and killed him. Although the villagers sounded an alarm齊　, they did not dare to pursue and arrest the bandits because they were unarmed.

<h3 id="e98">Jiangxi Finance Director Wu Jiantao Consults with Banking Industry on Grain Loans; Visited Minister Kong Yesterday to Request Instructions and Report Everything; Satisfactory Results; Returned to Xunzhou from Shanghai Last Night <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Wu Jiantao, the Director of Finance of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, came to Shanghai from Jiangxi a few days ago to contact the Shanghai banking industry for grain loans for Jiangxi Province to help the rural areas. The results were quite satisfactory. Yesterday at noon, he was accompanied by Song Ziliang, the manager of the China Construction Bank Corporation, to visit Minister Kong to request instructions on the grain loan and report on the current financial situation in Jiangxi Province. He left at 12:45.</p>
<p>Grain Loans</p>
<p>According to Wu, who spoke to the Shen Shi News Agency reporter yesterday, "My visit to Shanghai this time is to contact the Shanghai banking industry for grain loans and to ask for assistance from various banks. This year's grain production in Jiangxi Province, except for northern Jiangxi, which was affected by floods and had a slight reduction in harvest, the agricultural affairs in other counties in southern Jiangxi and in the former bandit areas have been bountiful. The amount of grain produced is rare in recent decades. However, Jiangxi's rural economy has declined in the past due to bandit disasters. This year's grain harvest is so abundant that prices are bound to fall, which will greatly affect the livelihoods of farmers. In view of this, the Jiangxi Provincial Government intends to raise considerable funds to buy up the grain accumulated by the people, so that prices can be slightly increased, in order to slightly improve the rural economy. The results of the consultation with the leaders of various banks in Shanghai were extremely satisfactory. Minister Kong also promised to instruct the Central Bank to provide assistance. The specific methods will be decided after I return to the province and discuss it with Chairman Xiong."</p>

<h3 id="e100">Loan Committee Changes Guarantee Method; Approves Several Loans <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee held its tenth meeting at the China National Goods Bank on Tianjin Road on the 6th. The committee members present were Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoyan, Song Ziliang (representing Qin Runqing), Zhang Peishen, Xi Demao (representing Zhang Peishen), Chen Guangfu (representing Yu Zuoting), etc. Chairman Cai Zengji, in addition to reporting on routine committee affairs, also proposed 35 applications for small credit loans, which were reviewed one by one. It was resolved to grant loans at the original requested amount to six companies, to grant loans at half the requested amount to eleven companies, to grant loans at a reduced amount to fourteen companies, and to reject four companies. The reasons for rejection were as follows: (1) the factory has stopped and there is little hope for the future; (2) the capital was falsely reported, and the guarantor denied the guarantee; (3) the business has been losing money, and the guarantee is inadequate. Excluding those that were reduced or rejected, the committee actually approved loans totaling 21,400 yuan. It is said that the committee will send out notices within one or two days, instructing the applicants to go to the committee to sign the documents and collect the funds. Those who were rejected will also be notified, and the applicants can take back the previously issued receipt to collect the previously paid investigation fee of 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Flexible Guarantee</p>
<p>The Loan Committee recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to relax the requirement that loan guarantees should be sought from two reputable businesses, changing it to one business. In addition, for small loans of 100 yuan or less, the committee can stamp a certificate from the same industry association, with three businesses in the same industry providing a joint and several guarantee. These two cases are now in effect. Yesterday, the committee sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, informing the various industry associations that the problem of finding guarantees, which was the most difficult for industry and commerce, now has a flexible solution, and applying for loans should be more convenient than before.</p>
<p>Letter to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>This is to inform you that we have received Instruction No. 17685 from the Ministry of Finance, along with four documents submitted by this committee, to comply with the order to amend Articles 2(2) and 4(2) of the loan regulations and to request that the requirement for loan guarantees to be sought from reputable businesses be relaxed from two to one, and that small loans be allowed to be guaranteed by three businesses in the same industry with joint and several liability. We request your prompt review and approval to facilitate implementation. The directive stated: "We have received and examined all the submitted documents. After reviewing the proposed amendments to the loan regulations, it is believed that they are for the sake of military affairs and to protect industry and commerce. Approval should be granted to amend them separately. Apart from Article 2(2), which should be handled according to the wording of the original amendment, Article 4(2) should be amended to "(2) Small industrial and commercial credit loans should have a reputable business as a guarantor responsible for repayment (if it is a limited liability company, the manager of the company should be responsible for the guarantee). The assets of the borrower and the guarantor should be investigated and confirmed to be reputable. However, for small loans of 100 yuan or less, three businesses in the same industry may be allowed to provide joint and several guarantees, and the industry association must stamp a certificate." Please comply with these instructions and report back for our records. This order." In view of the above, regarding the section on allowing three businesses in the same industry to provide joint and several guarantees for small loans, we previously consulted with your chamber and have submitted reports separately, replied to you, and made separate recommendations to the Ministry to change the two business guarantees for loans to one business, in order to be considerate of industry and commerce and to provide practical relief. We now inform you of the above for your information and request that you inform the various industry associations accordingly. To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Cai Zengji of the Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction Abolishes Silkworm Cocoon Monopoly; Manufacturers Allowed to Register Purchases; Zhejiang Silk Factory Requests Abolition of Improvement Fee <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>As the purchase of autumn cocoons is imminent, silk manufacturers in Zhejiang Province have jointly submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministries of Finance and Industry, clearly ordering the abolition of the improvement fee. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction has abolished the silkworm cocoon monopoly in order to maintain the merchants' difficulties. The Real Industry News reporter has recorded the following details:</p>
<p>Submitting a Request to the Executive Yuan and Ministries to Abolish the Improvement Fee</p>
<p>The silk manufacturers in Zhejiang Province, due to the burden of the improvement fee levied by the Department of Construction, have specially sent Chen Jing-xian, Xu Xing-bin, and others to Shanghai to contact British merchants, and have submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting the abolition of the improvement fee. The document reads, "Submitted regarding the levy of the fresh silkworm cocoon improvement fee, which lacks a legal basis. We earnestly request that you promptly correct it in order to relieve farmers and merchants and comply with the rule of law. Since the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction's Silkworm Monopoly Committee forcibly levied the improvement fee, silk cocoon merchants have jointly appealed repeatedly. The government clearly knows that it is illegal, and your Executive Yuan and ministries have repeatedly consulted Zhejiang to promptly correct the matter. It can be seen that justice resides in the hearts of the people, and government orders cannot be borrowed. However, the Zhejiang Silkworm Monopoly Committee, citing the slogan 'take it from the silkworms, use it for the silkworms,' levies repeatedly, disregarding everything. According to the cost of fresh cocoons, the levy is more than one-tenth, which is more burdensome than any other tax. Can we bear to ignore the people's appeals and disregard their suffering? However, the Department of Construction, under the control of the National Government, brazenly acts its own way. If the people are not worth pitying, what about the government's credibility? Now that the autumn cocoon harvest is about to begin again, this illegal and exorbitant levy, the improvement fee of one yuan and eight jiao per dan of fresh cocoons, is still being levied openly after the Executive Yuan's order to promptly correct it. How can we talk about the rule of law and relieving farmers and merchants? The manufacturers and others, after years of bankruptcy, are barely managing, already hanging by a thread. How can they endure further exorbitant levies? Therefore, we are compelled to jointly submit this request to your Executive Yuan and ministries for review and approval, promptly investigating and implementing Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Supervision of Local Finances, promulgated and revised by the Central Government in December of the 21st year of the Republic of China, clearly ordering the abolition of this unfounded fresh silkworm improvement fee in order to relieve farmers and merchants and comply with the rule of law. This would be a great benefit." Furthermore, a written statement was submitted, jointly signed by Xu Xing-bin, Chen Xiao-yun, and Chen Jing-xian, stating that Xu Xing-bin represented the Zhejiang Chang'an Silk Factory, Chu Han-bang represented the Xiu Lun Silk Factory, Zhu Wen-gao represented the Minsheng Silk Factory, Zhang You-yi and Chen Xiao-yun represented the Tiancheng Silk Factory, Chen Jing-xian represented the Fuxing Silk Factory, Wang Qi-qi represented the Tiaoxi Silk Factory, Jin Xiu-huang represented the Xianglun Silk Factory, Yu Jin-jiang represented the Chongyu Silk Factory, and Gu Li-sheng represented the Housheng Silk Factory.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Department of Construction Abolishes Monopoly</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction implemented a monopoly on all silk in Zhejiang last year, it borrowed 1.8 million yuan from Shanghai banking groups this spring to purchase spring cocoons from zones 1 to 6, while zones 7 to 10 were allocated to manufacturers for purchase. This method was quite effective. Zhejiang silk cocoon merchants, due to the decline in overseas silk sales and the poor business of silk factories, were greatly affected by the monopoly. The Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Association Joint Office in Shanghai telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government this spring, requesting the abolition of the monopoly by district. The Executive Yuan consulted the Zhejiang Provincial Government for cancellation. At that time, the procedures of the provincial government had already been decided and could not be cancelled immediately, so it only agreed to purchase by district. Now it is learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, in order to consider the difficulties of merchants and support the development of the silk industry, has abolished the silkworm cocoon monopoly. Hereafter, manufacturers are allowed to register and purchase within the ten zones. Members of the Yanshan Cocoon Industry have reported to the Shanghai office that the registration for purchasing autumn cocoons [unclear] stopped at 5:00 PM yesterday. Manufacturers [unclear] in Shanghai are planning to go to Zhejiang within days to begin purchasing cocoons in the areas they have registered for.</p>

<p>The new Stamp Tax Enforcement Law stipulates that for account books established before September 1st, if stamp duty has already been paid according to the old regulations, it is not necessary to add stamps according to the new law after September 1st, even if they continue to be used. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly interpreted and responded to this. In order to prevent misunderstandings by inspectors, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting that it explain this to various provinces inside and outside the capital. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued Approval No. 6985 of the Tax Department, stating, "Your telegraphic inquiry is understood. Checking vouchers for withdrawing money, goods, and materials, as well as account books used for various trades, the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty stipulate that each book must be stamped with one jiao of stamp duty per year. Therefore, the validity of the stamp duty paid should end on the date of the annual commercial closing. If the closing is based on the fiscal year, it should end at the end of the fiscal year. This has been the practice in the past. Although the current Stamp Tax Law has been implemented, for this year's account books that were started before its implementation and have already been stamped with one jiao of stamp duty as required, their stamp duty validity has not yet expired and there is no need to supplement stamps according to the Stamp Tax Law. To avoid misunderstandings during enforcement and inspection, a clear explanation should be given. In addition to issuing separate consultations, you should be informed of this approval."</p>

However, this observation group is not exclusively for those engaged in exports to China. There are giants from the Japanese financial and industrial circles who will either observe the Qingdao spinning mill and the practical problems of economic development in North China, or focus on the current state of imports and exports in Hankou, or explore the political trends in Nanjing, as well as the future situation of the international city of Shanghai. Therefore, its scope is quite broad.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Bizarre Case of Husband and Concubine Found Dead in Tapu Fang, Rue Pére Robert, French Concession. Frequent Quarrels Between Wife and Concubine. Police Investigation Suggests Suicide, But Traces of a Violent Standoff Cannot Be Dismissed <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>In a single three-story building at No. 8, Tapu Fang, Rue Pére Robert, French Concession, Jiang Jinmei, a second landlord from Nanhui, and his concubine, Wang A’mei, a woman from Zhoupu, were found dead in their bedroom. The discovery was made around 7 AM yesterday morning. Both had their heads nearly severed, connected only by a sliver of skin at the neck, a truly gruesome sight. Most strangely, those living in the same house heard nothing during the night when the deaths occurred. Whether it was murder or suicide is yet to be determined by the police. In any case, the circumstances are bizarre and sudden. Detailed information is provided below:</p>
<p>Divorce and Remarriage</p>
<p>Jiang Jinmei was a native of Nanhui County, Pudong, currently 37 years old. He specialized in contracting bean curd residue in Shanghai, then selling it to villagers to feed pigs. He was initially married to a Hu woman from the same village, with whom he had a daughter named Xiuzhen, now fifteen years old. Due to disagreements, they divorced by mutual consent in 1932. Later, Jiang remarried to a young Li woman from Songjiang. After three years, Li had no children, so they adopted a son named Genlin, only three years old.</p>
<p>Taking a Concubine</p>
<p>Two years ago, Jiang rented a single three-story house at No. 8, Tapu Fang, near Tapu Bridge on Rue Pére Robert, French Concession. Besides Jiang, Li, Jiang's parents, Jiang Xianhai and Jiang Chu’shi, and his children, other tenants lived there. Last year, Jiang became romantically involved with Wang A’mei (18 years old this year), the daughter of Wang Ding’shi, a fellow tenant from Zhoupu. In mid-February of this year, Jiang formally took A’mei as his concubine. The two of them used the front room on the second floor as their bedroom.</p>
<p>Discord Between Wife and Concubine</p>
<p>The remarried Li led her children to live in the back parlor downstairs as their bedroom. Jiang's parents hired six or seven rickshaw pullers, who temporarily lived in the front parlor, working early and sleeping late, as was their custom. Jiang treated his wife and concubine equally on the surface, but he actually favored A’mei. As a result, the relationship between the wife and concubine deteriorated, and quarrels occurred frequently. Although Jiang tried to smooth things over, Li remained resentful. A’mei’s mother, Wang Ding’shi, moved out in April and resided at No. 24, Wu’an Fang, Rihui Road, Rihui Port, in the Chinese area because she felt uneasy after her daughter married Jiang.</p>
<p>Not Seen Descending</p>
<p>Since marrying Jiang, A’mei became pregnant and was eight months along, with her due date approaching. The day before yesterday (the 6th), around 6 PM, another argument broke out between the wife and concubine, but it stopped quickly. Around 7 PM, Jiang and A’mei went upstairs to sleep. Jiang's parents, Li, and children, along with other friends in the parlor, played mahjong until 9 PM, then went to bed. Around 7 AM yesterday morning, the people downstairs had been up for a while but hadn’t seen Jiang and A’mei come downstairs. Li ordered her daughter Xiuzhen to go upstairs and call them.</p>
<p>Covered in Bloodstains</p>
<p>Xiuzhen called repeatedly but received no response. Then, she knocked on the door, but there was still no sound. She asked Zhu Jiang’shi, a neighbor and fellow villager living in the second-floor pavilion, to call them. After a long time, there was still no reply, which aroused suspicion. Xiuzhen pushed the door forcefully, but it was locked with a spring lock, making it impossible to open from the outside. She quickly grabbed a ladder, climbed onto the partition wall, looked through the bullseye window, and saw the bed curtains and floor covered in bloodstains, with a foul smell. Greatly alarmed, she reported to Jiang's mother, Chu’shi, who then notified the Lou Jia Wan Central Police Station.</p>
<p>Headed Couple</p>
<p>The police, led by Western Inspector Folongdeng, Chief Inspector Pei’erqi, Chinese Inspector Jin Jiulin, Detectives Zhang Ziying and Zhou Buguang, rushed to kick open the door. Inside, they found Jiang and Wang completely naked, lying on the bed. Their necks had been cut about two-thirds through with a knife. Contrary to rumors, their abdomens were not cut open. Jiang Jinmei was found face down on the floor near the window, with one foot in a foot bath bucket. Next to the bucket was a sharp knife about a foot long and two inches wide, the suspected murder weapon. Jiang’s neck had been cut one-third through. He was shirtless, barefoot, and wearing white cotton shorts. Both bodies were covered in bloodstains. The bed, mosquito net, and floor were also stained with blood. The detectives questioned the residents living upstairs and downstairs, who all claimed that it was quiet all night, which was very strange.</p>
<p>Court Examination</p>
<p>Later, the police found several suicide notes from the deceased Jiang Jinmei in the drawer of the dressing table, stating the reasons for his suicide. However, family members said that the deceased could not write. After detailed examination by Chinese and Western detectives, the family members living in the house were taken to the police station for questioning. Detective Wu Wengang was assigned to guard the deceased's home. Detective Zhang Chunsheng notified the Tongren Auxiliary Hall, ordering an undertaker to transport the bodies to the coroner's office. The Second Special Court was notified, and Judge Wang Ren and Chief Forensic Doctor Peng Hu arrived at the scene at 3:30 PM to conduct a detailed autopsy.</p>
<p>Resembling Suicide</p>
<p>According to the report of Detective Zhang Chunsheng, the police believed that Jiang Jinmei first killed his concubine and then committed suicide. The judge questioned the deceased’s parents, wife, and daughter, Jiang Xianhai, Jiang Chu’shi, Jiang Li’shi, and Jiang Xiuzhen, as well as witness Zhu Jiang’shi, who all testified that they did not hear any noise during the night and did not know how the deaths occurred. Jiang Xianhai requested that the bodies be collected for burial. The judge ruled that Jiang Jinmei and Jiang Wang’shi died from knife wounds and that the bodies were to be claimed by Jiang Xianhai for burial.</p>
<p>Hints and Clues</p>
<p>It was also said that after Jiang took Wang as his concubine, Jiang’s wife, Li, felt neglected and became restless. She had an affair with a gangster named "Lala’tou A’wu," whom she called "old man." Jiang discovered the location and time of their rendezvous and went with an axe to catch them in the act, injuring the lover with three axe blows. Friends intervened and mediated. Soon after, Wang discovered the place where Li was having an affair. Wang went there to catch them in the act. The lover, alert, heard the noise, jumped out of the window, and hired someone to extort 260 yuan from Wang. Because of this, the wife and concubine had a deep grudge. Now, the sudden deaths of Jiang and his concubine raised suspicion. The French police are currently investigating.</p>
<h3 id="e120">About to Perform the Dotting Ceremony, Suddenly Stopped, Snatching Away the Ancestral Tablet. Younger Brother Unwilling to Let Elder Brother Decide Funeral Alone, Elder Brother Reports to Police, Sent to Court for Trial <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Fei Keming of this county, a landowner by profession, possessing 200,000-300,000 yuan, had four sons and two daughters: eldest son Fei Yusheng, second son Junwen, third son Bingwen, and youngest son Meiwen. Daughters were named Guijin and Meijin. Except for Yusheng and Meiwen, who lived separately at No. 4, North Sichuan Road, the rest lived with their father at No. 70, Lane 741, Dongyouheng Road. Fei Keming, 65, passed away on August 4th due to illness. The funeral arrangements were entirely managed by the eldest son, Yusheng. The dotting ceremony was scheduled for the day before yesterday, the leading ceremony yesterday, and the funeral at 3 PM. The person invited to perform the dotting ceremony was a Mr. Xu, a teacher at a certain law school, and also Junwen's teacher. At 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, just before the dotting ceremony, Fei Junwen brought a self-defense pistol to stop it, snatching away the ancestral tablet and declaring that the funeral would not be allowed. Fei Yusheng asked him to return the ancestral tablet but was refused, causing the dotting ceremony to be canceled. Fei Yusheng reported to the Huishan Police Station. Detectives Huang Fugen and Wang Tongpo investigated and charged Fei Junwen with the crime of desecrating funeral and sacrificial rites. They obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special District Court and arrested Fei Junwen at 10 PM the night before yesterday. Along with a self-defense pistol and 70 bullets, he was taken to the police station for detention and sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Huang Risheng questioned him. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case, prosecuting him under Article 146, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and claiming that the accused had refused to reveal where he hid the ancestral tablet, indicating that he still intended to obstruct the funeral. Therefore, bail should not be granted. Although the accused had a license for the pistol, it expired in January. The police would handle it separately. Fei Yusheng testified that he specially invited his teacher to conduct the dotting ceremony for fear that the accused would object to the dotting ceremony, but the accused still interfered. He recounted the situation at the time. Fei Junwen argued that the father’s funeral should have been discussed by all the brothers and sisters, but the plaintiff acted unilaterally without consulting them. He did not even know who was invited to perform the dotting ceremony. Moreover, the ancestral tablet was taken by his sister and then given to him, not snatched. The plaintiff did not specify anything in the obituary today. His lawyer, Jiang Guofang, stated that the case was entirely due to family property disputes. After Fei Keming's death, the plaintiff, along with the youngest brother, took away all the iron boxes, deeds, and silver dollars. The funeral was entirely managed by him without consulting the defendant. In old customs, the dotting ceremony was extremely important. The person performing the ceremony must be prestigious, blessed with five fortunes, and their birth date must not conflict with the deceased, as this affected the prosperity of future generations. The plaintiff acted unilaterally, which was inappropriate. The police's request to deny bail was inappropriate, because if the funeral was indeed held today, the defendant's rights as a filial son should be protected. He requested that the defendant be allowed to leave. Judge Huang reviewed the testimony and ordered the case to be adjourned to next Wednesday for further questioning. The defendant was granted a 500-yuan bond and allowed to be released, with strict orders not to obstruct the funeral, or he would be severely punished. Fei Junwen agreed and left the court.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Great Fish Market Scheduled to Open in Early October, Magnificent Architecture, Precision Design, Final Stages of Construction Currently Underway <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Ministry of Industry has raised over one million yuan to build a large-scale fish market in Yangshupu, Shanghai, to revitalize our fishing industry. The internal construction is nearing completion and is scheduled to open in early October. The market building is very magnificent, and the design is highly precise, making it our country's only great fish market. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency has detailed the internal construction as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled Opening</p>
<p>The market is located about five li north of Dinghai Bridge in Yangshupu, at Zhoujiazuidao, facing the Huangpu River and across from Shanghai University. It faces the Huangpu River and backs the Dinghai River, with the Qiujiang Pier, which is under construction, to the north. Covering an area of over forty mu, it is not only large in scale but also conveniently located for transportation. The construction is expected to be completed this month and is scheduled to open in early October.</p>
<p>Overview of the Project</p>
<p>The completed structures include brokers' offices, auction yards, offices, a weather station, and riverside warehouses. The construction was undertaken by the Xinchangtai Construction Company. The brokers' offices are three stories high, with about eighty rooms. The auction yard is in front of the brokers' offices, shaped like a ring. The market office building is seven stories high. The accounting and bank office and a storage room are on the left side of the ground floor. The second floor has a reception room, the general affairs office, etc. The third floor has eight rooms, all for staff dormitories. The fourth, fifth, and sixth floors each have one room, also for staff dormitories. The seventh floor is the weather station. The riverside warehouses have also been completed.</p>
<p>Active Construction</p>
<p>The floating dock project includes three steel docks. The Shanghai Pudong Shipyard is constructing a shipyard for 80,000 yuan. The longest dock was launched on June 1st. The pile driving has been completed, and they are now driving platform piles. The Bund Dredging Bureau has dredged the area around the Pujiang Marsh Dock with a dredger. Once the platform is completed, the floating dock can be installed. The cold storage is being built by the American York Company of Shanghai for over 270,000 yuan, starting on April 10th. It is divided into four parts: cold storage, ice making, freezing, and machinery. The installation of machinery could have started earlier, but the cold storage room structure was remodeled, and the soil was alluvial. The Bund Dredging Bureau conducted an inspection, which delayed the work. Currently, the ice-making machinery has started to be installed and is expected to be completed this month. Additionally, the artesian well water tower has been completed. In the near future, this national state-run great fish market will be completed.</p>

<p>The late Shanghai gentleman, Mr. Wu, who lived at No. 97, Shangwen Road, Nanshi, was wealthy, attracting the attention of bandits. Last summer, Wu seized the opportunity to escape from the bandits' den. The investigation team has now captured the suspects Wu Miaoshuang and Zhu Binsheng. After interrogation by the prosecutor's office of the local court, they were prosecuted for kidnapping and extortion. Judge Shao Qinzhi held a public trial once, which was not concluded. Details were previously reported. It is now known that Judge Shao held a subsequent trial yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. After the judge was seated, the two detained suspects Wu Miaoshuang and Zhu Binsheng were brought to the court. After lengthy questioning, both suspects stubbornly denied any involvement, claiming they were falsely accused. Upon this point in the questioning, the judge ordered that witnesses be summoned for confrontation, and the trial was adjourned for further hearing. The two defendants were remanded.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Province Third District Maritime Public Security Team received confidential information that the notorious bandit Kou Daxiang, (also known as Kou Xiaoshu,) who had been rampaging in the Jiangbei area, had fled to Hongzhen, Zhabei, Shanghai, due to the intense pursuit in Jiangbei. District Chief Zhu Aizhou immediately dispatched detectives to go at night and arrested the bandit Kou Daxiang. He was then escorted to the Third District Headquarters of the Baochuan Maritime Public Security Team. According to Kou Daxiang's confession, he had been rampaging across the north and south of the Yangtze River for over ten years, killing dozens of people and plundering ships, such as the Bao Feng ship robbery case, the murder and theft case at the Sun Jishi family in Ganyu County, and the theft case at the Li Fengming family in Shengqiao, all of which were masterminded by Kou Daxiang, who directed the bandits. The information also revealed that the bandit Kou Daxiang's uncle had repeatedly advised him not to engage in illegal activities, but the bandit nature was hard to change, and in his anger, he completely murdered seven people, men, women, and children, in his uncle's family. To this day, the case remains unresolved at the county level. As the Maritime Public Security Team does not have a detention facility, the bandit was sent to the Baoshan County Government prison on the 5th for temporary detention.</p>

<p>Deng Zhiming, a Jinghu Railway conductor from Guangdong, 37 years old, who rented a cross-street building at No. 4, Jinsheng Li, Aier Zhe Road, Public Concession, committed suicide at his residence around 9:30 AM yesterday, apparently out of despair.

<p>Sun Guoan, a Western doctor, has a clinic at No. 137, Chunyang Li, Yangshupu. His wife, Ni Cuiyan, recently hired lawyers Li Zhongwen and filed a petition with the mediation court of the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce from Sun Guoan and demanding alimony. Judge Zhang Wenkui and a clerk opened the Civil Thirteenth Court for mediation yesterday morning. Both sides and lawyers were present. First, the plaintiff Ni Cuiyan testified that she was 28 years old and temporarily lived with her sister at No. 207, Chuan Gong Road. She married the defendant in 1930. In the early years of marriage, they were happy, but recently, for five years, she had been abused by the defendant, causing her to feel resentful. For the sake of her livelihood, even a slight disagreement would lead to beatings and injuries. She was examined by a forensic doctor, who provided a medical certificate, making it impossible to live together. She requested a divorce. The defendant, Sun Guoan, claimed that he had been a doctor for many years, specializing in treating Japanese patients. Recently, business has been poor, and his monthly income is not enough to cover expenses. He could not afford the alimony requested by the plaintiff. Judge Zhang ruled that mediation had failed and ordered both parties to file separate lawsuits.</p>

<p>Liu Chushan, a silk merchant, opened the Tongsheng and Yusheng silk stores in Shanghai, and owned properties such as the Furun Li, Derun Li, and Hongyu Fang, with assets worth over 600,000 yuan. Liu Chushan died on April 21, 1928. His daughter Cui'e had previously sued her brothers, requesting a division of the inheritance, and was awarded a substantial amount after the judgment. Recently, another daughter, Sun Liu, who is married and lives at No. 666, Xinza Road, hired lawyers Wang Weizhen, Zhou Xiao'an, and Yin Shijie, and filed a lawsuit against her mother, Liu Huangshi, and her brothers, Liu Xingjie, Liu Xingda, Liu Xingde, with the First Special District Court, requesting a division of her father's estimated inheritance of 300,000 yuan. She requested an eighth share, amounting to 37,500 yuan, plus three properties. Since May 1928, the monthly rent income was 2,760 yuan, totaling approximately 237,360 yuan, of which the plaintiff should also receive one-eighth, amounting to 29,670 yuan. The total amount the plaintiff should receive is 67,170 yuan, plus litigation costs. The case has been accepted by the court. Judge Ni Zhengbi opened the Civil Fourteenth Court for trial yesterday afternoon. The defendant's lawyer, Chao Kun, defended that the inheritance was not denied. However, the silk stores were in debt due to business failures and were under court seal, and the debts amounted to over 200,000 yuan, so all the assets were almost exhausted. One property was mortgaged to the China Commercial Bank for over 180,000 yuan, and the monthly rent income was not enough to pay the interest. Although there was indeed an inheritance of over 100,000 yuan, it was now impoverished, and the plaintiff's husband's family had assets worth millions, far richer than the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff did not participate in her sister's lawsuit in 1929. If she had participated then, she might have been able to obtain a portion of the property. The court urged the parties to reconcile as siblings, and adjourned the trial to allow for reconciliation.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Shanghai-Lake Night Shift Steamships Repeatedly Robbed <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Lixing, China Merchants, and Lixing Steamship Companies Successively Robbed. The Lixin small steamship of the Lixing Steamship Company of this port, on the 5th, when returning to Shanghai from Huzhou, encountered two bandit ships at around 8:00 PM in the Xiehedang area. There were more than a dozen bandits who fired shots, boarded the ship, rummaged through boxes and chests, and robbed wantonly for an hour. On the same day, a small steamship of the inland river China Merchants Steamship Company was also robbed by bandits at the same time. According to passengers, when the bandits were robbing the two steamships, a fragrant boat towed by the small steamship was also robbed when passing through the area. Afterwards, the Lixing Steamship Company examined the losses and found that about one hundred and several tens of yuan in passenger fares and cargo funds had been robbed, as well as many items of clothing from the crew members. As for the silver and foreign goods carried by the passengers, there is no accurate number to investigate. The Futai water steamship of the Lixing Steamship Company, on September 6th, opened from the lake to Shanghai. At 10:00 PM, passing near Zhangjiabang, (Zhangjiabang and Xiehedang are very close), suddenly dozens of bandits, each with their faces painted red and black, holding box cannons and short knives, ordered the ship to stop and robbed silver, foreign goods, clothing, silk fabrics, and other items from the steamship company's cargo ship and fast ship, resulting in extremely heavy losses. It is heard that Lixing and Liyutong have issued loss reports and asked the Inland River Steamship Industry Association to submit them to the authorities for investigation. The section of river between Zhangjiabang and Xiehedang is a necessary area for water transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Boats and ships come and go, and it is usually very prosperous. Now, continuous robberies every day are shocking to hear.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Murder of Fan Asan Case: Pei Xueshi Detained Yesterday; Witnesses Testify Vividly, Defendant Vehemently Claims Injustice <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Pei Xueshi, a Chinese constable of the Water Patrol Room, in November of the year before last (the 22nd year), cohabitated with Fan Asan, the concubine of the late Zheng Kaijun, after becoming acquainted and renting a house. On January 6th of this year, at 6:00 PM, Fan Asan suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Suddenly Disappeared</p>
<p>The next day, Fan Asan's body was found in a desolate place on Ma Yushan Road, with knife wounds on her neck, clearly indicating that she had been murdered. The local guarantor reported it to the District Court, which dispatched personnel to examine and coffin the body, pending the arrest of the murderer. Recently, Zeng Fan's, a woman from Yancheng, accused Pei Xueshi of murdering her younger sister, Fan Asan, at the District Court Prosecutor's Office. After the court accepted the case and conducted an investigation, due to the lack of corroborating evidence, Pei Xueshi was not prosecuted. Zeng Fan's refused to accept this and appealed to the High Court for reconsideration. As a result, the basis for the appeal was deemed insufficient, and he was still not prosecuted. Zeng Fan's still refused to accept this and filed a third appeal for reconsideration. Zhang Zi, the prosecutor, tirelessly sought details, repeatedly summoned witnesses, and conducted a thorough investigation, concluding that Pei Xueshi had strong suspicion of instigating murder.</p>
<p>Major Suspicion</p>
<p>He filed a lawsuit with the criminal court, requesting a public trial for Pei Xueshi, who was ordered to find a suitable guarantor to await instructions. The main points of the indictment were roughly as follows: The defendant, Pei Xueshi, cohabitated with the concubine of the late Zheng Kaijun in November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. He gradually squandered more than 1,000 yuan in foreign currency that Fan Asan had privately saved. On July 16th of the previous year, due to an incident, he quarreled and injured Fan Asan's head. After mediation, Pei Xueshi gave a promissory note for 500 yuan, which led to resentment. Pei Xueshi, fearing future trouble because Fan Asan had hidden the promissory note in her sister Hui Fan's house,</p>
<p>Intended to Murder</p>
<p>On January 6th of this year, at 6:00 PM, he incited an unidentified man to go to 255 Yangzhou Road to invite Fan Asan out on the pretext of negotiating a price. He designed to lure her into a car and drive to a desolate place on Ma Yushan Road, where he killed her with a knife. After the incident, Zeng Fan's filed a lawsuit. The examination of the deceased Fan Asan revealed a cut at the right corner of her lower lip, connecting to her right jaw, a cut in her throat, and her trachea was severed. Her left ring finger had been cut off, indicating that she died from her injuries. After opening the coffin, Zeng Fan's and Pei Xueshi confirmed that it was indeed her. The unidentified man invited Fan Asan out on that day, which was also confirmed by Dong Shaoyuan, Fan Asan's landlord at 255 Yangzhou Road, who testified to Pei Xueshi's</p>
<p>Hostile Relationship</p>
<p>Not only did Zeng Fan's state this, but Fan Asan had also previously filed a case against Pei for assault. Fan Asan did not hide the 500 yuan promissory note given to her by Pei Asan in her own house but instead hid it in her sister Zeng Fan's house. From this, it can be seen that their feelings were broken and they were irreconcilable. If the unidentified man was not Pei's friend, why would Fan Asan rashly go with him to Ma Yushan Road? Before the incident, a car was discovered parked at the scene of the incident. Although this was a one-sided statement from Zeng Fan's, it coincided with the time Fan Asan left, and it was credible. In conclusion, Pei Xueshi had strong suspicion of instigating the murder of Fan Asan, and he committed the crime under Article 371, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, etc. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Tan Zhuohong specially opened the Eleventh Tribunal to interrogate the defendant Pei Xueshi. Lawyers Yan Shenshi, Wu Kaisheng, Zhu Honglie, and others appeared in court to defend him. The plaintiff, Zeng Fan's, hired lawyer Su Fuchou to appear in court and request a private prosecution for over 3,000 yuan. First, witness</p>
<p>Ding Buying testified</p>
<p>Age 29, formerly a peddler, residing at Gaolang Bridge. In February of this year, I don't remember the date, I went to Zeng Fan's house to chat. At that time, Pei Xueshi was also in Fan's house. I heard Pei Xueshi say to Zeng Fan's, "Don't sue me. I am willing to find Asan's body and perform rituals for her," etc. I don't know anything else. Next, the defendant's mother, Pei Zhu's, and the defendant's wife, Xiao Pei Zhu's, were called to court. According to</p>
<p>Old Pei Zhu's</p>
<p>Age 50, from Yancheng, residing at 34 Changan Road, Zhabei. Xiao Pei Zhu's, age 32, lives with her mother-in-law. The official asked if they had gone to take things from Fan Asan's house. Pei Zhu's and others replied that they had not taken anything. The official said, "How can you say you didn't take anything when the landlord witnessed it?" They replied that they didn't know. The official ordered Pei Xueshi to the dock, age 33, from Yancheng. He asked if he had gone to Zeng Fan's house and said that he was willing to find Asan's body and invite monks to perform rituals. He replied that he had never been there. Zeng Fan's and Ding Buying are relatives, and they colluded to frame me. I am actually very wronged. The official said that the testimonies of the witnesses were very inconsistent. The case is serious, and the witnesses probably did not dare to testify casually. The official, for the sake of caution, ordered Zeng Fan's to leave the court.</p>
<p>Separate Interrogation</p>
<p>He then asked Ding Buying what exactly happened. The case concerns human life, and he should testify truthfully without being vague. He replied that Pei Xueshi was sitting on a stool, and I was sitting on the bed next to him. Zeng Fan's was cooking at around 2:00 PM. The official obtained his testimony and ordered Zeng Fan's to the dock, then questioned her in detail. Her testimony was largely the same as above. When questioned by Pei Xueshi, he vehemently claimed injustice, firmly stating that they were relatives and had colluded to frame him, and requested an investigation. The official considered the circumstances of the case to be complicated and did not open the debate today, but scheduled a continuation of the hearing after a detailed investigation. The defendant Pei Xueshi was ordered to be detained pending further instructions. The defendant's lawyer then requested that he still be released on the original bond. The defendant argued that he was a constable in the patrol room, and imprisonment would hinder his duties. The official considered the case to be serious and did not approve it. Finally, the court clerk ordered him to be taken into custody.</p>

The daughter was taken back by her father, Zhang Chunshan. Yesterday morning, Huang was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department stated the background of the case, stating that the defendant was previously a partner in the victim's shoe store and is now being prosecuted under Article 240, Section 13 of the Criminal Law for disrupting marriage and family. Zhang Chunshan stated that the defendant was indeed a former partner in the store, and Yuebao is 18 years old and not yet betrothed to anyone, let alone him as a husband. He requested an investigation. Zhang's daughter said that the defendant took her out to live there, otherwise he would beat her parents. When questioned by the defendant, he claimed that the girl voluntarily followed him to seek a wife. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be returned to custody pending sentencing.</p>

<p>The New Yu Second Yarn Factory at No. 8 Labosheng Road was formerly the Puyi Yarn Factory. It was taken over by a new owner on February 20th of this year and changed its name to the current name. It was unexpected that yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, an oiling worker named Wan Wenkui, (from Yancheng, age 30) was working in the weaving workshop when he suddenly saw a leather belt on a stocking break. He climbed up the ladder to repair it, but at that time the machine was still running, causing him to be careless for a moment and his right hand was caught in the machine. He was unable to break free. His colleagues Liu Zhaoqing and others caught sight of it and quickly stopped the machine, but Wan's right wrist had already been severed and separated from his body, and his legs were also severely injured. He fell from a height of fifteen feet. Afterwards, the factory reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station in charge, and Detective Pi Shaozhang and others were dispatched to investigate. They summoned an ambulance to send Wan and his severed hand to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He soon died. His body was transported to the Ferren Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, an inspector from the First Special District Court, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to witness Liu Zhaoqing's statement, and Wan's mother, Wan Zhou's, who claimed to be 53 years old, residing in a thatched shed at Zhujiawan, Zhabei, stated that the deceased was her eldest son and had worked at the factory for more than ten years. Now that he had died while working, there were still several elderly and young people in the family who depended on him for a living, and she requested generous compensation. According to Li Laobo, the personnel manager of the factory, the deceased died in the line of duty, and according to factory regulations, compensation of 150-160 yuan should be given, but seeing that his family was poor, they specially increased the compensation to 220 yuan and stated that they had already purchased coffins and other items. Mr. Song, noting that there was no severed hand of the deceased in the morgue, inquired with Chinese Detective Pi Shaozhang. He reported that after the deceased had an accident at the factory, he accompanied him to the hospital, and the severed hand was not missing. Later, when the hospital transported the body to the morgue, he was not present. He requested that the deceased's family accompany him to the hospital to inquire about the situation. Mr. Song approved it and instructed that the deceased Wan Wenkui, male, had indeed died from machine injuries before his death. The body was handed over to his mother, Wan Zhou's, who signed a bond to take it back for coffining and burial. He also instructed Luo Zhengchao, the manager of the factory's machinery, to be extra careful and improve the prevention of such unfortunate events in the future to avoid the recurrence of the same tragedy.</p>

Various bureaus and stations should assign personnel to conduct real-time inspections. If the above is found, it should be punished in accordance with the regulations." The bureau, in addition to notifying all affiliated messengers to comply, printed and distributed a notice and is conducting investigations outside at any time and sincerely requests all parties to report as much as possible so that a thorough investigation can be conducted and people can avoid being harassed.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>In your newspaper's local news column on the 7th of this month, you published a section of the notice from the District Rent Reduction Association to its branches, which stated, "The City General Association has virtually stopped its activities, etc." This is extremely shocking. Upon investigation, the rent reduction work of our association is currently in a period of energetic progress, and its leadership of the various branches to promote the achievement of rent reduction and implementation is being closely watched by people from all walks of life. It has never been slightly stagnant. The various sections stated are all inconsistent with the facts. We hereby send a special letter to your newspaper to request a correction, so as not to hinder the rent reduction movement. The citizens will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate. This is addressed to the Editor of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, September 7th</p>

<h3 id="e144">Preliminary Athletics Trials for the City's National Games: Dai Shuguo Sets National Record in 400 Meters—Time: 52 Seconds Even—Women's 100 Meters and Long Jump Results Are Promising—One Participant in the Decathlon Will Not Continue Today—Official Representatives Still Need to Be Selected by the Selection Committee <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The autumn air is crisp and refreshing, the perfect time for athletes to show their skills. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the city's supplementary trials for athletes to attend the National Games in athletics were held at Jiaotong University. Although there were only fifty or sixty athletes participating, they were full of vigor. In the men's events, Dai Shuguo broke the national record in the 400 meters with a time of 52 seconds even (the national record was Liu Changchun's 52.4 seconds), which was the best achievement of the competition. In the women's events, Qian Hangsu's time of 13.5 seconds in the 100 meters was relatively outstanding.</p>
<p>Guests from Afar</p>
<p>It has already been decided who will represent the city in athletics at the National Games. This supplementary election is to ensure that no talent is overlooked and to give an opportunity to those who have not participated in the city's summer training camp. Among the special guests attending the competition yesterday were Lin Shaozhou, who previously represented Fujian, Dai Shuguo, and the Shandong girls Zhu Tianzhen and Ding Guimei. However, Miss Pang Yuanyu from Changshu, although she had registered, did not attend the competition.</p>
<p>Competition Situation</p>
<p>What was disappointing yesterday was that Zhang Jiaqi did not attend the long jump and triple jump, and was eliminated after only competing in the 100 meters. Dai Shuguo finished fourth in the 100-meter final, and then jumped to the top in the 400 meters, maintaining a consistent pace from start to finish. In the upcoming National Games, he will be a strong opponent for Dong Shuzhao. Also, Lin Shaozhou took to the field despite being ill. It is heard that he is suffering from a severe cough, so he did not dare to exert himself fully during the competition, resulting in mediocre results. Also, Dai Junchang's time in the 800 meters, 2 minutes and 8.6 seconds, was quite impressive. If he represents the city in the National Games in the future, he may have a chance of finishing fifth or sixth. The results of the men's events from the north are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Women's Athletics</p>
<p>In the women's athletics competition, Little Qian won first place in both the 50 meters and 100 meters, with the 100-meter result being better. There was no final in the 200 meters because no one participated. In the high jump, Zhu Tianzhen won first place with 1.29 meters. In the shot put, Ding Guimei won first place with a score of 9.14 meters, which may also win points for the city in the future. However, Shi Ouqing was helpless yesterday due to a foot injury. In the long jump, she was defeated by Chen Zaichun. Chen Zaichun won the long jump with 4.83 meters. It is a pity that Qian Hangsu gave up this event, and Miss Pang did not come, so Chen reigned supreme.</p>
<p>All-Around Competition</p>
<p>Yesterday, three people joined the pentathlon and only Wei Zhiping joined the decathlon. The results were mediocre. Wei Zhiping did not complete the first half and, because his results were too poor, it was decided that the second half would not be held today. Sun Huipeng won first place in the pentathlon with a score of 2057 points, which was calculated using the latest published scoring method of the National Games, which is slightly less advantageous than the old scoring method.</p>
<p>Snippets from the Venue</p>
<p>Dai Shuguo Lives Up to Expectations</p>
<p>The 400-meter expert Dai Shuguo came to Shanghai to serve this time. Yesterday, he tested his skills for the first time in the preliminary round, attracting many fans to watch. Dai planned to participate in three events: 100 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters. He finished first in the preliminary round of the 100 meters with 11.8 seconds, but fell to fourth place in the final, which greatly disappointed the audience. However, the 100 meters is not Dai's forte, so he gave up participating in the 200 meters to conserve his energy. Sure enough, he showed his skills in the 400 meters, leading all the way to the finish line, breaking Liu Changchun's national record of 52.4 seconds with 52 seconds. The audience cheered again and again.</p>
<p>Lin Shaozhou Takes to the Field Despite Being Ill</p>
<p>Lin Shaozhou of Fujian, who holds the national record of 16.2 seconds in the 110-meter hurdles, was also the focus of attention. However, Lin completed the race in 17.5 seconds. Although he won the championship, his results regressed. According to Lin, he has had a cold for two weeks and has not recovered since coming to Shanghai. Recently, his cough has worsened. He took to the field despite being ill, and his footwork was not strong. Moreover, the northerly winds were very strong yesterday, and running against the wind also affected his results. After a few days of rest, he can still restore his previous record.</p>
<p>Pang Yuanyu's Fragrant Figure Is Gone</p>
<p>Miss Pang is from Changshu and has a long jump result that broke the provincial record in the Jiangsu Provincial Games. This semester, she came to Shanghai to study at Dongya (some say Aiguo) and also registered to participate in the city's preliminary round. The fans in Shanghai all wanted to see the style of the small group from Changshu, but unexpectedly, due to physiological reasons, she could not participate yesterday, so her fragrant figure was nowhere to be found in the venue.</p>
<p>Zhu Tianzhen's Results Decline</p>
<p>Miss Zhu Tianzhen from Shandong is a famous general who holds the national women's high jump record. She also participated yesterday. Due to a long period of disuse, her legs were stiff. She had to jump four times to clear 1.29 meters, which is far from her original record of 1.355 meters. The second place, Niu Zaichun, was 1.23 meters, and the third place, Yang Ying, was 1.20 meters.</p>
<p>Chen Zaichun Jumps Well</p>
<p>Chen Zaichun's long jump yesterday was 4.83 meters, which is equal to Li Senzhi's result and not far from the National Games record of 4.88 meters. With a little more practice, it will not be difficult to break it. Shi Ouqing originally stood out in the All-Nations Games. Yesterday, she suddenly injured her ankle when jumping to 4.35 meters and could not jump any further, finishing third. At the same time, she cancelled her scheduled participation in the 100 meters and high jump and left.</p>
<p>Qian Hangsu Runs Faster and Faster</p>
<p>Miss Qian Hangsu has already held the national records in the 200 meters, low hurdles, and long jump. Yesterday, she also participated in the 50 meters and 100 meters. Her 50-meter result was 7.4 seconds and her 100-meter result was 13.5 seconds, which are not far from the national records. It is possible that she will give up the long jump and switch to the 100 meters in the upcoming National Games.</p>
<p>10,000 Meters: Only Two Arrived</p>
<p>Fourteen people participated in the 10,000 meters. Veterans Wan Jinsheng and Zhou Ruquan both participated, but retired halfway due to exhaustion. Qian Zenglong originally had hopes of winning the championship, but his old illness relapsed in the fifteenth lap and he had to withdraw. Only Ling Xuewen and Bao Yibi completed the course.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Ministry of Education Sets November 10th for Qualification Examination; Yesterday's Order to National Vocational Schools Above the Specialized Level: Students of Unregistered and Closed Private Vocational Schools Must Pay Attention! <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th dispatch) The Ministry of Education has set November 10th of this year for the qualification examination in Shanghai and Peiping. This was reported in this newspaper on the 4th of this month. Yesterday (the 7th), the Ministry of Education ordered all vocational schools above the specialized level across the country, stating: "This Ministry has held several qualification examinations for graduates and students of unregistered and closed private vocational schools above the specialized level, and has clearly indicated that such examinations will no longer be held. However, many students are still waiting and watching, and have not participated promptly, which is a missed opportunity. However, there are also those who have not been able to participate due to location or other reasons, which is understandable. In order to take into account the studies and qualifications of these students, it is decided to hold another qualification examination in Peiping and Shanghai on November 10th of this year as a form of relief. All public and registered private vocational schools above the specialized level must order students from unregistered and closed private vocational schools above the specialized level whose admission qualifications have not been approved by this Ministry in previous reports of new students to participate in this qualification examination and obtain transfer qualifications. All documents must be submitted by each school to the Ministry by February of the 25th year for verification. If the reports are not submitted by the deadline, the Ministry will cancel the students' academic status. In addition to issuing notices, this order is issued for compliance and to inform all students. Furthermore, when schools recruit new students and transfer students in the future, they should uniformly admit those who hold a transfer certificate issued by this Ministry. Graduates should also be allowed to take the entrance examination for the fourth year, and after passing the examination, they may be admitted to the final year of study without being restricted by Article 4 of the University Regulations and Article 4 of the Revised Vocational School Regulations. You are to comply with this order."</p>

<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>When you see the term "science," you must feel it is boring and tasteless. In fact, if you are a little patient and study it slowly, you will discover that "science" is a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>I know very well that teachers must have explained the importance of "science" to you more than once, right? However, teachers have never pointed out "science" to you and taught you how to learn it, have they?</p>
<p>When you enter the fifth and sixth grades, you will have new courses, such as nature, history, and society, which are actually "science"! As for arithmetic, it is a tool for studying "science." Do you understand?</p>
<p>Now I will write down the method of organizing a "Children's Science Research Association":</p>
<p>(1) It is best to form a group for each grade, and the fifth and sixth grades form two groups, forming a single association. The number of people should be at most 60, with ten people in each team.</p>
<p>(2) Each team has two team leaders, one chief and one deputy.</p>
<p>(3) Hold a team leader meeting once a week and a general meeting once a month.</p>
<p>(4) Membership fees are two small ocean dollars per person, used to purchase equipment and books.</p>
<p>(5) If there are any difficulties with any grass or tree, ask each other for advice. Finally, you can send representatives to ask the teachers, and you must not stop until you understand thoroughly.</p>
<p>(6) Which team reports in detail and correctly, and which team studies thoroughly, will be judged by the joint team leaders, and the best few teams will be purchased prizes to encourage them. Well, children, let's all get up and organize!</p>
<h3 id="e172">International Storms of Thunder and Lightning <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Jianzhai Fu</p>
<p>The storms of war have already spread like thunder and lightning between Europe and Africa! Children, you have all seen and heard it, haven't you?</p>
<p>The Italian leader Mussolini had long regarded Abyssinia in East Africa as his own. Abyssinia was originally a semi-civilized black country in East Africa, a large piece of fat meat coveted by all white people that had not yet been disposed of. On the international stage, Abyssinia was an unknown soldier. How could he dare to fight against Italy, a first-class white power? He was naturally unwilling to submit, preferring to die rather than surrender. He longed for the powerful British and Americans to be his bodyguards. You see, before the war even started, he ceded the oil mining rights, which accounted for more than half of the country's total area, to the African Development Company of the British and American side. In order to cover up their peace proposals, the British and Americans had to temporarily give up their possession of these oil rights due to Italy's accusation. However, Italy still declared that it would act freely and not allow the League of Nations to stop it.</p>
<p>The British Empire has long been the hegemon of the sea. For Italy to send troops, it must pass through the vital passages of the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea: these passages are all under the control of the British Navy.</p>
<p>Now Italy's attitude towards Abyssinia is like a mantis catching a cicada. The cicada falls into the mantis's palm, but the mantis itself cannot but be wary of the oriole behind it—the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Although Britain ostensibly sings loudly about staying out of the situation and maintaining peace, it is actually consolidating its naval array in Malta and other places—vital passages in the Mediterranean—and does not allow it to be easily violated. Do you think Britain can avoid being drawn into the whirlpool if war breaks out? Once Britain declares mobilization, it will become a direct confrontation between Britain and Italy. Germany, France, the United States, Japan, and other countries all have intertwined interests, so the scope of the war will immediately expand. Isn't this the prelude to the Second World War?</p>
<p>Children! If a major war breaks out in the West, what will happen to us in East Asia? We must remember that less than twenty years ago, when the First World War was in progress, our neighbors took the opportunity to become active against us. You can ask your teachers about this story.</p>
<p>Now that the first major war is about to come again, how will the situation in East Asia change accordingly? Can we still hide in the cradle and have sweet dreams?</p>

<p>Playing with fire is something that Min'er often does. He often puts the black head of a match on the black surface of the matchbox. As long as he puts his thumb [blank space] on the black head and presses it slightly, the black head will burn. At the same time, he quickly releases it, so the black head falls down while burning. One day, he was playing like this again when his brother saw him.</p>
<p>"Min, you need to know that this thing is very dangerous. If you are not careful, you will burn your fingers. On the one hand, you are wasting a match for nothing, which is a pity."</p>

<p>"In the old method of making matches, cotton had to be used for the wooden stick, which was even more time-consuming. So now the matchsticks are made of poplar branches. There are two types of matches: one is called the red-headed match, and the other is called the safety match. Red-headed matches are very dangerous because they are easy to burn, and the workers who make this kind of match are often poisoned because red-headed matches are made of yellow phosphorus. Yellow phosphorus is very poisonous, and eating 20% of it can kill people, so it is prohibited by the government authorities. Now what we see are all safety matches.</p>
<p>To make safety matches: 1. Dip one end of the matchstick into a flammable liquid, like candle oil for lighting. 2. Dip it into glue again, and when it dries, it becomes the match head. This glue is a mixture of sulfurized brother and gum. 3. The surface of the box is coated with red phosphorus, sulfurized ladder glass powder, and gum. This kind of match must be rubbed on a special box surface, otherwise it will not burn."</p>

<p>Butterflies are arthropods belonging to the insect class. There are many different kinds, approximately one hundred and forty-nine species. They have beautiful wings, a pair of club-shaped antennae on their heads, and a small abdomen covered with fine hairs. They do not have stinging barbs. During the day, they fly among flowers, sucking various flower juices. When at rest, their wings stand upright on their backs. Their pupae do not form cocoons, but instead use silk to hang from branches and walls. They are all a type of plant pest! Children, please look at the pictures on the left. For example, various swallowtail butterflies mostly harm fruit trees, and pierid butterflies mostly harm vegetables. Nymphalid butterflies, amathusiid butterflies, satyrid butterflies, lycaenid butterflies, hesperiid butterflies, mostly harm herbaceous plants and agricultural products. Think about it; they cause such harm to plants, which is very harmful to us. Indeed; even when you catch them to play with or make specimens, if you are not careful, they can damage your eyes. This is because their wings have very toxic powder. When you catch them, they struggle violently, and the toxic powder flies around. If it gets into your eyes, it can easily ruin our precious eyes!</p>

<p>Because I like to buy books, I have a lot of children's books at home. Recently, at Yun'er's request, I donated these children's books to her to start a small library, and I even bought her two bookshelves to display these books. So she joined forces with a dozen classmates and the neighbor's daughters to start it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>The library is located in a small room. Inside, in addition to two bookshelves, there is a small table and a few small benches. Every day after school, they hide in that small room to read. If there is something they don't understand, or a word they don't know, they come and ask me. Although I find it a bit of a bother, their progress is very fast.</p>
<p>In addition to being open every day, they can also borrow books to read. They have a small booklet. The person borrowing the book writes the title and their name in this booklet, and then they can take it out! When they return it, they cross it out with a pen.</p>
<p>Normally, Yun'er and the others each have one dime for candy money every day. Now they save this money to buy books. Other children also often donate books to this small library, so their books are increasing day by day. Children! Does your dad have books? If so, you can do this too!</p>

<p>There are over forty types of deer in the world. Those produced in Northeastern China are called "Guandong Deer." Their antlers and velvet antlers are very precious, and traditional Chinese medicine considers them to have the effect of nourishing yin and tonifying yang. Deer are gentle by nature, and their fur changes with the seasons. In spring, it is reddish-brown with beautiful spots. In summer, it is brown. In autumn, it turns brownish-tea. When it turns burnt-tea, the spots gradually appear as well, but when does turn dark purple, the spots become less visible. In summer, deer live in deep mountains, and move to the foothills in winter. In late autumn, when maple leaves turn red, stags call out to hinds. Around April and May, they give birth in lush grassy areas near streams. The fawns are reddish-brown with white spots. Deer are herbivores, similar to giraffes. They move very quickly. If they encounter a predator, the stags will face them with their antlers, and the hinds will kick the enemy with their front legs. Deer antlers are replaced once every February or March, like an annual herb, with new growth every year. The antlers of young deer do not have short branches. After about eight years, they have three branches. When antlers first grow in the spring, the round ends are covered with skin, called "velvet antlers." At first, they are reddish-brown, gradually turning black. The antlers are densely covered with blood vessels. As they age, the velvet antlers turn into hard antlers. When fully developed, the outside is dark brown skin, like the trunk of a tree. The antlers naturally fall off every February, so before they fall off, they are sawn off for use in medicine and carving tools. Usually, the end of October is the most appropriate time to saw off the antlers. However, the deer raised in Chinese pharmacies are sawn off before that time in order to harvest the velvet antlers.</p>

<p>If we humans didn't have a pair of hands, we wouldn't be able to do anything. It's like fish not being able to swim without fins, and birds not being able to fly without wings. Thanks to us having this pair of hands, we are not afraid of not being able to do anything. Farmers use this pair of hands to grow rice for us to eat. They also grow cotton for us to make clothes to wear. Workers also use their pair of hands to make all kinds of things for us to use. Even eating and dressing, or using various tools, all require their use. Ten fingers are working non-stop, so we have food to eat, clothes to wear, and places to live. If they ever went on strike together, we would inevitably suffer from cold and hunger. They are truly our best friends. We rely on them for life, and we cannot leave them for a moment.</p>

<p>Little friends will find this topic quite strange. How can there be water that doesn't sink? But the fact is this: in the British town of Trethevy Quoit, the water there mostly contains about 40% salt content—because the town is famous for its salt production. The locals have built several swimming pools. Because of the high salt content, the density of the water is high, so people won't sink in it. In that water, you can do all sorts of things, read the newspaper, play ball, have a picnic: it's truly supreme happiness. Little friends! Are you envious?</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>The little drummer replied, "Of course! Do you think I could avoid it?" He said earnestly, because this was the first time he had been injured, and he felt very honored. Otherwise, he never dared to speak in front of the senior major.</p>
<p>"At that time, I lowered my head and ran for my life, and also crouched down from time to time, but those Austrians had already seen me. If they hadn't injured me, I could have arrived twenty minutes earlier. Fortunately, I ran into a major from the general headquarters, and I handed him the letter. However, I still struggled to come back afterward. I was dying of thirst, and I was worried, fearing that I would delay important matters. I was roaring angrily, thinking that every minute of delay would be enough to send one of our men to their death. But I have done my best. I am satisfied. But Major, look, you yourself are bleeding!"</p>
<p>Indeed, blood was flowing from the senior major's injured hand because the bandage was not secure.</p>
<p>The little drummer hurriedly said, "Major, should I tighten the bandage for you? Let me help you."</p>
<p>The senior major gave his injured left hand to the little drummer, while using his right hand to help tighten the knot of the rope; but the little drummer had just propped himself up from the pillow when his face suddenly turned pale and he fell back down.</p>
<p>The senior major looked at him and quickly retracted his hand, saying, "Forget it! Forget it! Take care of yourself, don't worry about other people's business; you must know that if you don't take care of a minor injury, it may become irreversible in the future."</p>
<p>The little drummer shook his head.</p>
<p>The senior major looked at him very intently and said, "But you are so weak, mostly because of too much blood loss."</p>
<p>The little drummer smiled and said, "Too much blood loss? More than blood. Look!" Saying that, he opened the blanket covering his lower body.</p>
<p>The senior major was shocked and took a step back.</p>
<p>The child only had one leg; the left leg had been amputated above the knee. The place where it was cut was wrapped in cloth, stained with blood.</p>
<p>At this moment, a short, fat military doctor walked past. He pointed at the little drummer and said to the major, "Ah! Major, this is an unfortunate thing. This leg could have been preserved, but because he used too much force, it was inflamed, so it had to be amputated, but he was very brave, and never shed a tear or cried out in pain. When I was performing the surgery, I felt very proud, thinking that he is truly one of our Italian children! Truly, he is the seed of a hero!" After speaking, he walked away.</p>
<p>The senior major frowned his thick white eyebrows, looking at the little drummer, and covering him with the blanket. Unconsciously, he raised his hand and took off his military hat.</p>
<p>The little drummer cried out in surprise, "Major! What? Are you saluting me?"</p>
<p>The rough old soldier, who never said a gentle word to his subordinates, said in a gentle voice, "I am just a major, but you are a hero!" Saying that, he stretched out his arms, held the little drummer, and kissed him very sincerely. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e183">Finance: Hong Kong Market Gradually Loosens; Gold Standard Enters the 80 Yuan Range; Industry Mentality Leans Lower...Continues to Fall by 7.8 Yuan <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Since the previous day's setback, the gold market continued its downward trend yesterday. The Hong Kong market was unusually tight, even retreating into the 80 yuan range. Market sentiment remained stubbornly in the same state as the previous week. Even with foreign activity, it was difficult to stop the slide. Early in the morning, with overseas silver market up in London and stable in the US, major players stated that buyers would follow the listed price after the market closed. Montreux forward silver prices rose by five hao and narrowed by two and a half li, respectively. Exchange rates continued to fall, and London raw gold rose by two and a half pence. Sentiment was steady, based on the assumption that major players were still buying in after-hours trading overnight, which made it difficult to fall during the morning session.

The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with the British rate flat and the US rate narrowing. The customs gold unit rose by four li.

Upon learning of the HSBC Bank's official rates, the British rate was flat and the US rate narrowed by 1.25.

Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to cover their positions, and the exchange market tightened slightly for a time. Buyers actively came forward, gradually rising, and banks took advantage of the expensive prices to sell, but the Chinese merchants had little buying intention, and the rising momentum was blocked. At this point, there were frequent rises and falls, but because the volume of transactions was limited, the situation was mediocre and hovered for a long time. Market sentiment finally panicked, and selling pressure gradually increased. The Hong Kong market loosened, gradually retreating into the 80 yuan range. It was predicted that Indian silver would shrink by two annas, and there was a rebound for a time, but because the Hong Kong market was unusually tight, with rumors of large sales by Chinese merchants, major players came to unload, and the exchange market continued to loosen.

This was mainly because rumors about currency issues had a huge impact on the entire financial system, which could not be resolved in a short period. As a result, most bulls took the opportunity to exit, and the supply from Northern traders continued to flood in, causing the market to initially decline and then enter a period of fluctuation. The future trend will likely be determined after Lothar arrives in China. For the time being, there will not be excessive ups and downs. The market yesterday saw a large number of declines in the morning session due to the closure of positions at 59, 33, and 69, with most prices falling by five to ten points. The market then became chaotic, and transaction volume decreased. In the two afternoon sessions, transactions became even more scarce, and price fluctuations stabilized. Overall, market prices fell by five to ten points across the board. The total transaction volume was 3.47 million yuan. The high and low prices are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market was very active yesterday (the 6th), with prices rising by one to three dollars. This was because President Roosevelt allowed a brief respite from legislative matters, which boosted morale. Chrysler Motors reached its highest price since 1929. The value of General Motors stock increased by 43 million dollars. U.S. Steel rose to a new high for the year. Railroad and utility stocks also advanced across the board. Before the close, trading was particularly brisk due to short covering and investment purchases. Small exchange stocks rose, and the bond market was strong and lively. The total transaction volume was 2.15 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>September 5th   September 6th   Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks   129.34   130.75   Up 1.41</p>

<h3 id="e189">Yarn and Cotton: Reasons for the Yarn Market's Decline; Banks Offload Over 4,000 Bales of Pledged Yarn; Japanese Yarn Sells Well, While Local Yarn Lags Behind <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has declined, and the situation has softened again. This is mainly because banks have 4,100 bales of pledged cotton yarn in their hands, which they have all offloaded on the exchange, mostly for the September, October, and November terms. As a result, market sentiment suddenly eased. Although spot yarn sales have been maintained recently, only Japanese yarn is selling well, while local yarn continues to lag behind. The future situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Yarn Falls One Yuan This Month</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, prices for the current month suddenly weakened. Rumor has it that a certain factory is preparing to close, and all of its yarn inventory is being offloaded by a certain bank for the near term, causing the market to ease further and sentiment to decline. The market gradually declined. At the same time, the rumors from the previous day were unfounded, and the market became even more depressed. Closing prices for all months fell by five, six, seven, or eight points compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session saw no improvement in near-term prices, and spot yarn business was not as brisk as the previous day. As a result, near-term prices fell by three, five, or six points compared to the morning closing price, while long-term prices rose by one or two points. Osaka's three yarn products all rose by one yuan. It is reported that 500 bales of Dafu yarn, 450 bales of Minghua yarn, 450 bales of Ruidai yarn, 1,850 bales of Yuan Yi yarn, 350 bales of Taichang yarn, 650 bales of Dachang yarn, 300 bales of Changyu yarn, 350 bales of Yongda yarn, and 400 bales of Xincheng yarn were sold. 1,200 bales of Tongfu yarn, 850 bales of Yudai yarn, 1,150 bales of Gengfeng yarn, 350 bales of Changyu yarn, 350 bales of Deji yarn, 400 bales of Dafu yarn, 350 bales of Ruidai yarn, and 350 bales of Tongfeng yarn were purchased. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Over 1,200 Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still brisk. It is reported that a total of 1,245 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, including futures contracts. Market sentiment is flat and weak. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 255 Guangdong 470 Yunnan 155</p>
<p>Dealers 20 Henan 177 Hankou 13</p>
<p>Fujian 5 Shantou 35 Changsha 90</p>

<p>The cotton market is weakening and entering a sluggish state. This is because new cotton is entering the market from various regions, and unless the weather changes, there are signs of congestion in supply. Therefore, cotton merchants are selling when the market rises, and those holding goods are actively offloading October contracts when the October price reaches 32 yuan. As a result, the market has turned sluggish. At 4 PM, the customs signal ball was raised, indicating the possibility of a hurricane hitting Shanghai. However, the exchange had already closed.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Follows Yarn in Declining</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, prices declined because the rumors from the previous day were still difficult to realize, the weather cleared up, and the yarn market was weak. The cotton market was also dragged down, and the trading floor was flooded with selling orders. As a result, prices for all months fell by two to two and a half points compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session remained weak, but Ruidai bulls returned to buy and add to their positions. The weather also showed signs of changing, with strong winds and dark clouds at times, which boosted market sentiment. As a result, prices for all months rose by five to ten points compared to the morning closing price. Osaka's three cotton products rose by three, four, or five points. It is reported that 1,300 bales of Yudai cotton, 600 bales of Shengyuan cotton, 700 bales of Dafu cotton, 700 bales of Yongchang cotton, 600 bales of Renfeng cotton, 3,300 bales of Changfeng cotton, and 700 bales of Xinheng cotton, and 1,400 bales of Changhe cotton were sold. 2,200 bales of Changji cotton, 3,800 bales of Ruidai cotton, 1,100 bales of Senkang cotton, 900 bales of Yidai cotton, 1,300 bales of Fuyuan cotton, 600 bales of Ruiyuan cotton, and 1,300 bales of Shenji cotton were purchased. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed on the left:</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with prices rising by one to five points for all months. Although the news from Liverpool was good, there was no response here because foreign merchants were selling and cotton farmers were selling short. Later, spot traders and Liverpool bought October contracts, which also became firm. Subsequently, the weather in the eastern cotton belt was expected to clear up, and brokers sold off, falling again. There was not much short covering, and buyers hoped for lower prices. The government sold October contracts and bought July contracts, while spot traders absorbed October contracts. Finally, short covering, inter-dealer trading, and strong stock market conditions boosted the market again. Spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by 4 to 8 points. Hasted estimates that factory consumption this week will be 169,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory will be 140,000 bales. British spot cotton rose by 2 points, and futures rose by 1 point. Indian cotton rose due to short covering and futures traders buying. Pingguo Er rose by 1.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for both near-term and long-term months gradually declined. This was because there was too much floating supply before the festival, and new stockpiles were not being purchased smoothly. Furthermore, the market was affected by large factories dumping spot flour. In terms of raw materials, foreign sources have not been coordinated for a long time, and domestic inventories have been depleted. Flour prices do not seem likely to fall again. However, the current economic hardship cannot be denied. The sluggishness of actual sales and the slight decline in spot prices are ultimately constrained by the economy. Yesterday, large non-industry stockpiles were still actively buying. Foreign wheat also rose, and market prices could have stabilized after factory sales, but the market instead fell. At the close, this month was down 0.75, November and February were down 0.25 each, and the remaining months were down 0.5 each.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Futures Wheat: Bulls and Bears Wait and See <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were very few transactions in the wheat market in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Most sessions were empty bids. Because it was before the Mid-Autumn Festival, most parties focused on closing positions and waiting to see. Even non-industry stockpiles were uncertain about buying. On the selling side, sellers were also concerned that production prices were high and foreign wheat was not suitable. They were also afraid of being burdened in the future if they sold at low prices. Therefore, both sides stalled, and prices saw little fluctuation. Only September fell by 0.061 points for the entire day, and the others remained unchanged. Spot wheat prices remained firm due to tight production prices, and traders remained optimistic. Factories could not lower prices and continued to participate in the market. Yesterday, Shandong wheat opened at 3.65 yuan, Yaowan, Xuzhou, Mingguang, and Shahe were all at 3.64 yuan, Jiangbei was at 3.60 yuan, and Henan and Beijing were all at 3.52-3 yuan. It is estimated that Fuxin purchased 3,000 bags, Fufeng purchased 1,000 bags, and Xinda purchased 500 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the total supply of local rice (Shanghai South) from various groups was about 20 vendors (about 4,000 stones of goods). The weather was sunny, and sentiment was weak. Sales were unusually sluggish, and all package sales were completely stagnant. After several days of mediocre market conditions, a downward trend emerged. Like a broken cable, prices saw small losses. Few inquired about thin rice, and it depreciated by more than two inches. The prices of new Jiangnan river goods also followed suit, falling by one point. Only factory goods with high-quality materials stood firm due to scarcity. As for foreign Sichuan and other new top grades, they were already weak a few days ago. Yesterday, in this unfavorable environment, they suddenly plummeted by four to five points. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, the total supply of river goods from various regions was about 40 vendors. The market's goods were going, and white rice sales improved slightly, with prices weakening by one or two points again. Early rice was down by a small point, and thin rice prices were down by two small points. Over 900 stones of Dongxin glutinous rice arrived. In addition, sales were stagnant, and prices were affected by the firm intentions of customers, creating a situation of rejection. White yuan were priced high, and medium grades weakened by nearly one point. New Kejian Tuanjian sources were contacted and sold separately. Market conditions were weak by nearly one point in the early market, and later prices weakened by another small point due to stagnant sales. The prices of other goods also showed signs of weakening.</p>
<p>The foreign Kesian market situation had been in a firm position, but after the river rice fell one after another, the market sentiment was dragged down. In particular, after the middle and lower grades of foreign Jian rice fell by five or six points, it further affected the foreign Kesian rice. Because sales have been the highest in Benjie in recent days, Benjie will inevitably switch to handling river goods when river rice prices fall. However, foreign rice stocks have been depleted, and the arrival of foreign currency has also been small. Owners are still unwilling to devalue foreign rice with river rice, so foreign rice only fell by three to five points, and foreign currency only fell by seven to eight points. The whole city sold 692 bags of Gan Yong mechanical early rice, which were divided among the Benjie Beibang. Xiaowen Luo and Ximao jointly sold over 1,000 bags, and except for over 300 bags sold by the inland Shaoyong, all were taken by Benjie.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market was still flat. Sales of treasures, needles, and eyebrow teas to France were still stagnant. The reason is that the African war clouds are spreading, and merchants have to take a wait-and-see attitude. Only Pinshui pearl tea sells well in the American market. Large road merchants also have scattered sales. Yesterday, Xiehe, Qiahe, and other companies purchased over 400 boxes, and market prices are firm.</p>

<p>Dozens of packages of new walnut Changping goods arrived yesterday, and samples were already being shown. The quality of the goods is average, and the texture is also soft, which is the norm for new goods. They were opened for sale at 21 yuan to 20.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The arrival of large quantities of new black melon seeds is rare, and the market is very tight. Yesterday, 40 packages of Jikui seeds arrived, opening at 17.2 yuan, and 40 packages of Jizhong seeds arrived, opening at 16.4 yuan. This price is still the highest new record for this year, and the market is still expected to be tight.</p>

<p>The sugar market trend was flat yesterday. The association's trading price for spot 24 raw granulated sugar was 17.18 yuan, with slight transactions, up 0.02 points. The asking price for new transshipment goods was 5.4 yuan, and the asking price for old goods was 5.3 yuan. Jiantong, Dabai, and others opened 80 boxes of Wufu white ice, with the best price at 17.1 yuan, up 0.1 yuan. The Chao Bang continued to open 200-odd bags of cotton red sugar, with the highest price at 11.4 yuan, followed by 10 yuan, and the remainder slightly lower. Furthermore, the highest post Qing sugar was 9.55 yuan, followed by 9.45 to 9.35 yuan, with over 400 bags sold.</p>

<p>The Japanese 559 yuan straight tribute flannel has been selling very actively recently. Both local and foreign buyers have large transactions, and shoe factories are even more eager to buy. Yesterday, the public welfare association sold over 20 boxes, with the price per yard being 3.55 yuan, up 0.025 points from the day before. It is said that although the business of the 559 straight tribute flannel is large, dealers do not have any remaining profits because the current price is rising, the Japanese exchange rate is very expensive, and costs have increased. The overall Shanghai flannel market has not improved.</p>

<p>Forty-foot-long bamboo steel bars have been selling very briskly recently, so many are being offered on the market. Standards are very strong due to exchange rate relations. For example, three-point square is estimated at 120 yuan, round is 107 yuan, four-point square is estimated at 100 yuan, round is estimated at 150 yuan, five-point square and round are both sold at 93 yuan, six-point square is 95 yuan, round is 97 yuan, seven-point square and round are sold at 94 yuan, and eight-point square and round are all opened at 100 yuan. Yesterday, the construction group purchased 60-70 tons, and foreign groups such as Qingdao, Fuzhou, and Xinghua also purchased over 40 tons. The variety of colors in the city is very uneven, and the asking prices vary. For example, three-point square and four-point round are in short supply in the current market, so the market will continue to rise.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Whose Sin Is It? <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Qiong</p>
<p>—On the Issue of Women's Decoration—</p>
<p>During this period of special economic depression in the world, international trade is declining, and the domestic market is shrinking to an extreme, which has led to the most common and serious problems in the world today. However, under this economic situation, the production and consumption of women's consumer goods in various countries can stand apart. For example, in the United States, "the money spent on decorating women's faces and bodies continues to be as lavish as before the economic panic - about 30 million yuan per week, 156 million yuan per year, more than twice the revenue of India" (A. Hurley, "Cosmetics and Female Beauty," New China, Vol. 3, No. 15). From the perspective of the "production of the U.S. cosmetics industry, the scale of production of all industrial sectors has shrunk during this recession, but only the cosmetics industry has not been affected" (quoted from the above magazine), this not only confirms that the domestic consumption of women's cosmetics in the United States has not declined, but also shows that the consumption of American cosmetics in countries such as Europe, which consume the most, has not decreased. Even in China, where the consumption of cosmetics is relatively small, in this extremely serious economic panic, according to the National Tariff Commission's conversation with reporters: "In the first half of the year, the import of perfume and powder, a women's consumer good, reached 558,770 yuan, which has not decreased compared to the same period last year" (Shen Bao, August 3, 1935). The consumption of women's cosmetics in the above countries has not decreased, which refers to the absolute value; if compared to the proportion of general commodities, it has undoubtedly increased compared to last year or the year before.</p>
<p>In the present time, when international trade in various countries is generally declining and people's purchasing power is generally shrinking, the fact that women's cosmetics are still relatively increasing is a noteworthy issue. Therefore, various explanations have been aroused for this problem, and the conclusion of these many different explanations is that the beautification of women is becoming increasingly high. Therefore, in this recession, they would rather tighten other consumption than reduce the decoration on their bodies. As a result, the manufacturers of snow cream and white jade cream, the beauty experts, the sellers of rubber weight loss belts and weight loss massage machines, and the authors of how to cultivate the lower abdomen are still surging and continue to obtain their fat profits.</p>
<p>This explanation, on the surface, is of course not without reason; unfortunately, it only grasps the phenomenon and does not see the essence. The relative increase in women's cosmetics cannot be explained by psychological reasons such as women's "innate love of beauty" and "particularly high beautificationism." We should seek its fundamental causes from the changes in the economic life of women at all levels. During this panic, the polarization of the general population is becoming increasingly significant; the so-called upper-class women, relying on the concentration of their masters' capital and the increase in profits, can of course continue to expand their consumption of cosmetics indefinitely.</p>
<p>More importantly, a large number of middle- and lower-class women cannot find normal work to maintain their simple and plain lives during this period of economic contraction and widespread unemployment panic. Since labor cannot be sold, women's special commodities have to be sold, from prostitutes, dancers, massage therapists, and receptionists all the way to vases, socialites, and even the so-called "socialites" and "ladies," selling their bodies in various ways, either openly or secretly, creating a particularly prosperous market for human flesh. These special commodities, like general commodities, encounter fierce competition during the panic, so they have to use more beautiful decorations and larger advertisements to attract customers in order to sell. In order to obtain the necessities of life, these many women have to "fall into" the decadent life of injuring customs and morals, "using thick powder and enchanting clothes to beautify themselves as much as possible in order to win the favor of customers." Therefore, their "tightening other consumption and unwillingness to reduce facial decoration" is of the same significance as the hard-working farmers would rather starve and save a little money to buy seeds and fertilizer. Because if not, even this little "tightened" means of livelihood would be impossible to obtain!</p>
<p>It is easy to see here that the rise of women's beautificationism and the relative increase in the production and consumption of women's cosmetics are the results of the polarization of women's economic life, reflecting a very serious economic panic and hiding a very tragic and widespread sale of the body. Therefore, women's gorgeous clothes are completely built on the existing economic structure. If we think that women's heavy makeup is due to a natural love of beauty or a desire for vanity, and in turn condemn women, then we have not only failed to grasp the core of the problem, but also covered up the serious root of the problem. We oppose women's heavy makeup; however, we are convinced that this "injury customs and morals" behavior is not the sin of women themselves, but an inevitable thing created by the unreasonable social system. Under this system, women are not only slaughtered, but also "lambs" who "suffer for others."</p>

<p>— Bai Ping</p>
<p>——The Experiences of a Girl from the Jiliang Institute——</p>
<p>Through a chance opportunity, I stayed for a few days in a Jiliang Institute in the Japanese Concession. I had the chance to chat with many of the girls there. Among them, Aihua was the most pitiful. Her story is briefly described below:</p>
<p>According to Aihua's own account: In the spring of her ninth year, her father passed away, and her mother went out to work as a hired hand in the countryside. Her eleven-year-old brother worked as a cowherd in a poor family in a nearby village. Aihua was sent to a woman in a neighboring village, known as a "female tiger," to be a child bride. From the moment she entered that door, her life became that of a beast of burden, constantly scolded while working! Besides cooking and laundry every day, she was often sent to the mountains to collect firewood. Poisonous snakes bit her hands and face; thorns painfully pricked her skin. Upon returning home, not only did she have no one to confide in, but she was sometimes beaten or forced to go hungry for returning too late or collecting too little firewood. Her husband was an idiot who was already fifteen years old but spent his days playing. Aihua had to serve him in everything.</p>
<p>She endured this kind of life for more than three years. As she gradually came to understand things, she felt that the abuse was unbearable, and her idiot husband made her future seem bleak. One autumn night, she quietly left this tiger's den, this living hell, alone. She walked and walked, hoping that in the city she could find some work, support herself, or perhaps even find her mother.</p>
<p>City H was a bustling and scenic city. When she arrived, it was exactly seven o'clock in the morning. Everything she heard and saw felt new and interesting. Aimlessly, she didn't know where to go, so she wandered nervously around the intersection. At this moment, a policeman suddenly appeared, grabbed her without explanation, and dragged her away. She trembled with fear, crying and begging, but no one paid attention to her. As a result, she was dragged into the detention center. At this time, she felt regret, anger, and panic. The bitterness in her heart was indescribable. Aside from crying, she couldn't say a word. After three or four days, and transfers to two or three places, she was sent to this Jiliang Institute. Inside were sisters of similar age and supervisors who never left their sides. Her clothing, food, and housing were also taken care of. She thought this was paradise on earth and that she could learn to read, work, and live a stable life. Little did she know that the reality was completely different from what she expected. The supervisors' gentle attitude at the beginning turned into a ferocious and menacing expression. They scolded and鞭策 her all day long, making her live in constant fear. At the same time, the food was not nutritious enough, and a dozen people were crammed into one room. Air and sunlight were naturally out of the question, and they were confined all year round, not allowed to step outside. Her heart was full of sorrow, with no one to confide in. After two years of this, Aihua was already pale and as thin as a rail. Her tuberculosis had reached the second stage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a compassionate supervisor came later. She sympathized with the girls, especially Aihua. Knowing that she had tuberculosis, she tried to treat her and provide her with nutrition. Only then did Aihua taste what people called kindness. Unexpectedly, this compassionate supervisor was dismissed by the later director in less than a month. When Aihua heard this news, she felt extremely sad because she would soon lose this motherly supervisor. She cried, she cried bitterly! Just as she was crying sadly, she suddenly heard a thunderous roar, and at the same time, she was struck three or four times on the back with an iron-like fist. Poor girl! Her head was dizzy, her heart ached, and she rolled on the ground, like a lamb about to be slaughtered. She coughed violently, spitting out a large pool of blood. Wanting to resist, she was threatened by the iron fist and dared not move. Later, she learned that this iron-fisted man was the brother of the director of the institute. Because he hated her emotional display of farewell, he struck her with his iron fist. From then on, Aihua fell ill in bed, living a life of suffering from illness.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Section 5: Women on the Eve of World War II <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>Since the panic on the New York Stock Exchange in the autumn of 1929, the capitalist world has begun to embark on a path of despair and darkness. Many scholars, capitalists, speculators, and political commentators believed in the principle of economic cycles, advocated the possibility of economic recovery, and longed for the return of the golden age of capitalism! However, the ruthless reality shattered their illusions. It had been six years since the panic erupted, and not only was there no hope of ending it, but it had spread widely to the world, grasping everyone's hearts more deeply. If panic is a flood, then the people in the capitalist world are all drifting and struggling in this flood. As a result, countries are all studying ways to save themselves, trying to rescue their own countries from the muddy currents of panic!</p>
<p>But where is the way to save oneself! There is only one way, which is to sacrifice other countries to prosper one's own country—war! We know that after this panic, a "live or die" war has already begun between countries. This is the so-called tariff war and currency war. Now these economic wars are turning into wars of poison gas and bombs. In Manchuria in the East, the first battle has already passed. In Africa in the West, a massacre is being prepared! In this way, the terrible god of war that people curse has finally poured down on our heads! Now is the eve of the great destruction of mankind! People are trembling before this terrible god of war!</p>
<p>However, on the eve of this Second World War, we women cannot help but recall the painful past of the First Imperialist War. Therefore, we cannot but prepare to cope with the inevitable disaster of tomorrow!</p>
<p>Women in various capitalist countries have already experienced various kinds of suffering during the gestation period of this Second World War. In order to alleviate the unemployment panic, governments openly deprived women of their right to move. In order to increase the number of citizens who would become cannon fodder in the war, women were asked to give birth to children at home. In order to make women soldiers in the rear during the war, women were given military training. In this way, governments regarded women as necessary supplies for preparing for war, and placed them under the control of the state and even the military!</p>
<p>We often see in newspapers the preparations for the coming war by women in various countries. The most prominent of these are the women of Japan and Germany. The Great Japan National Defense Women's Association, organized in 1932, had a total of 1,688,424 members by the end of April this year. It is said that the association is developing very rapidly, and now there are branches in the Kwantung Leased Territory and Manchuria. It is completely under the guidance of the military and will carry out the tasks that women can do in the war.</p>
<p>Secondly, since Hitler came to power in Germany, the country has been preparing for war. Since the recent announcement of rearmament, women throughout the country have also had to assume the responsibility of national defense. According to the latest Berlin dispatch; "There are now six million German women who have received considerable training to serve the country in times of war. In addition, there are twice as many women who are currently undergoing training, so that the country can use their capabilities once something happens, in line with the new national conscription system." "... About six million German women are currently joining air defense associations and aeronautical societies, and others aged between eighteen and fifty are also engaged in more general activities. In short, all German women are registered by the National Socialist Party for use when the country needs them." (Damei Evening Post, August 3rd)</p>
<p>This situation is the same in all capitalist countries at present, especially in Italy recently, which is mobilizing the people of the whole country, sending men to the African front, and incorporating women into the labor force of military supplies industry, as in the First World War.</p>
<p>But here, there are two points that we women must pay attention to. The first point is that the war in capitalist society, although it raises the banner of "patriotism" or "national survival" on the surface, is in essence something launched by a few capitalists in order to obtain their commodity markets and to obtain huge profits. The result of the war, even if victory is achieved, is only the victory of a few capitalists. Most of the people who participate in the war are either cannon fodder or have illusory joy! Especially women, no matter whether they win or lose, cannot achieve fundamental liberation. The experience of the First World War tells us that women in both victorious and defeated countries only lost their husbands and children, and aggravated the tragic lives of women! Therefore, we should stand up and resolutely oppose war. The second point is that since we have recognized the nature of modern war, then we must actively obtain women's own liberation in the war. We know that in the First World War, the women of the Soviet Union actively participated in this liberation war, and as a result, they achieved final victory!</p>
<p>"Postscript" In the eighteen lectures, I have very briefly described the lives of women in various major eras and societies. This may be said to be a small history of women's lives, and I want to conclude it here as the first part of this lecture. Starting from the nineteenth lecture, I will specifically talk about the real problems such as women's problems and women's liberation movements raised in this historical development, but because the lecturer has limited ability and various restrictions, I cannot live up to the readers' expectations. I am very sorry! I hope readers will give me unreserved criticism.</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Life of Boat Girls on Nanhu Lake in Jiaxing <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Ting</p>
<p>Nanhu Lake in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, also known as Mandarin Duck Lake, has very beautiful scenery. The famous Misty Rain Tower stands in the center of the lake, and is also attached with many pavilions, terraces, and towers, which reflect each other. There are also many historical sites that can be commemorated, so it is often crowded with tourists and extremely lively. Only because the Misty Rain Tower is surrounded by water on all sides, and there is no land route to pass through, people who go to visit must take a boat in order to cross over.</p>
<p>The boat rowers are generally young women, the older ones are less than thirty years old, and the younger ones are only thirteen or fourteen years old. There are generally two on each boat, and tourists call them boat girls.</p>
<p>These boat girls, in order to attract tourists, all put on rouge and powder, and their attire strives to be fashionable, preferring to have something to wear without being able to save on food. Generally, people always come out in the afternoon and evening, so these boat girls don't come out much in the morning, either resting at home or washing the boat clean on the boat. Once it comes to the afternoon, they all put on heavy makeup and come out to solicit business.</p>
<p>After they come out, they go to solicit customers along the street. Even when the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway train arrives at Jiaxing Station, they actually run to the station from afar to pick up customers.</p>
<p>"Rowing the boat? "I'll take you! I'll take you to Misty Rain Tower to have fun! "Your boat is clean, can I take you there?"... These kinds of words are the terms they use when soliciting tourists. If they see the tourist nod in agreement, they are very happy and lead the way with a smile, leading the tourist to their boat; if the guest does not agree, they pucker their lips at that guest and go to solicit someone else.</p>
<p>But they are all very kind. If you get on their boat, the hospitality is very thoughtful. When the famous Nanhu water chestnuts or lotus roots are on the market, they will take out peeled water chestnut meat or sugar-pickled lotus roots to offer to the guests, but if you eat a plate of their water chestnut meat or lotus roots, in addition to the boat fare, you should at least reward them with two dimes.</p>

<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>As usual, Xiuzhen returned from the mountain after collecting firewood, her face a little red, but mostly green. As she turned from behind the house, her sister-in-law was bending over to pull up mustard greens, piles of dirt turning over with the roots of the vegetables.</p>
<p>Grandfather stood next to her, picking up small stones and throwing them aside from time to time, muttering to himself:</p>
<p>—Really, you think I'm dealing rice with you. Look how hard the soil is on this piece of land, all stones. If I were to use this piece of land, it wouldn't be enough even if I spent ten days removing all the stones and turning over the soil. You don't have to set it up this year. Next spring, take two boats of lake mud and spread it on top, then you can grow vegetables.</p>
<p>After grandfather left, her sister-in-law looked at the vegetables, looked at the empty land, stood there blankly for a while, then went to the kitchen to get a kitchen knife and sat on a low stool, chopping vegetable heads.</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen put the firewood down under the porch, and her mother instructed her:</p>
<p>—Xiuzhen! Spread the firewood out a bit to let it air out."</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen entered the door and took off her straw shoes, and her mother sighed:</p>
<p>—The vegetable garden has already been pawned! Alas! She sighed. "To pull up such small mustard greens... It always can't be kept... This piece of land..."</p>
<p>Her sister-in-law cooked a large pot of vegetable porridge. When it was time to eat lunch, she put the child on the stool and said with a smile to Granny Youfu, who delivered the money for reciting the Buddha's name:</p>
<p>—Look! My sister is helping me with housework! She fetches firewood for me every day." Turning to Xiu Zhen:</p>
<p>—Sister! Eat porridge, I cooked thick porridge." She changed her tone and said to the child, "Little one! Sit over a bit, don't soil your aunt!"</p>
<p>Granny Youfu handed the copper coins to her mother:</p>
<p>—Old Mrs. Zonggui asked me to send the money for reciting the Buddha's name. She said it's seventy-two in total. The fourteen you borrowed last time have been deducted, so here are fifty-eight copper coins. Count them!" Saying this, her eyes glanced at the thick porridge on the stove.</p>
<p>The compassionate mother knew that Granny Youfu was the same as herself, and that she was alone, with no children, living alone in a thatched shed, and that she was always able to get through the days by reciting the Buddha's name. When she got the chance to recite the Buddha's name, she ate two meals a day, and sometimes only one, so she was always walking from house to house, waiting for people to eat, and asking for a little oil.</p>
<p>—Aunt Youfu, have a bowl, it's hot." The mother brought over a bowl of porridge.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law's eyes darted sideways at the bowl of porridge that was being handed over. Although she didn't say anything, her heart ached, she thought: "This bowl of porridge! It's that pawned piece of land. Eating one more bowl of porridge means one less piece of land." The child spilled a little porridge, and she took the opportunity to vent her anger, the chopsticks drumming on the child's head, rattling away: "Little devil! No eating, noisy eating, there is eating, not eating properly."</p>
<p>Granny Youfu ate like a tiger devouring a butterfly. As soon as her stomach was a little full, she began to talk about this and that:</p>

<p>"Women's Life"</p>
<p>The autumn wind has blown away the heat of summer, and the brave young students are about to re-enter the school gate. Here I would like to introduce you to a good reading material, that is "Women's Life." Its lively layout and novel materials are indeed an excellent extracurricular reading material. Not only should female students above middle school have one in hand, but male students also need to continue it.</p>
<p>It was said in its publication speech: "It will be your confidant, giving you much wisdom, making you know yourself, know others, know society, know the world, and know all ugliness." Who wouldn't be happy to have such a confidant? It is a monthly magazine and has already been published in the third issue. The publisher is Shanghai Magazine Company. It is said that the company will give preferential treatment to students (from the beginning of this school year to the end of this month), and all students who go to subscribe will get all twelve issues for one dollar and eight cents, which is four cents cheaper than the original price.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Fighting Nation and the Fighting Individual <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Kuo Qing</p>
<p>The process of life is the history of battle, which is the common principle of all living things, and of course human beings are no exception. All living things must survive, they resist the oppression of natural cold, heat, hunger, and thirst, and fight with nature, resist the persecution of similar living things, and fight with other lives, and they constantly maintain their lives in the process of fighting, so they live in the world. Human beings, in their fundamental way of life, are exactly the same. They fight with nature, obtain living resources from the struggle of production, avoid various oppressions of cold, heat, hunger, and thirst, and they also fight with ordinary lives, defending against the harm of other creatures to them, using and overcoming domesticated creatures for their own use, becoming the victorious dominator in the war. He also fights with human beings themselves in a certain stage of evolution, striving for the survival interests and rights of individuals and the social groups whose interests are the same as his. From this, it can be seen that there is no life without struggle, and no living without fighting.</p>
<p>Although human beings and ordinary living things all live in battle in the same way, the fighting methods of ordinary living things are mostly individual direct response forms of fighting, simply determining their direct fighting methods according to the environment. A fierce tiger fights back with teeth and claws, and a sheep simply runs away when chased. Although a cat knows to lie still when catching a mouse, waiting for its opponent not to know it, and then suddenly jump to catch the mouse, this is still only limited to the instinctive impulse of fighting. Human beings are different, because human beings have a very complex social life, so their battles are carried out through many curves, and they must see the intricate relationship of the complex environment everywhere, distinguish it consciously, and even know how to choose and plan various fighting methods and strategies to win. Therefore, when active on the front line of human life and fighting for life, one must strictly study tactics and strategies.</p>
<p>In a broad sense, human beings also have their tactics and strategies for fighting against nature, because human beings themselves, in terms of their own ability, have neither the strength of fierce tigers nor their sharp claws and teeth, nor the flying skills of birds in the air, nor the running ability of good horses and cunning rabbits, so when he fights with physical strength and instinct alone, he can't even be considered a strong person in the biological group, let alone conquer the great forces of nature. However, human beings have eventually become the king of creatures and the conqueror of nature, which is because they have various ingenious techniques of fighting and certain tactics of winning. These fighting techniques of human beings are the production techniques of human beings. All scientific developments, as human organs themselves extend, deform, and improve, are artificial organs, such as machines and all production tools, and even the methods of engaging in production using these tools, are the production techniques of human beings, and the techniques of fighting on the lifeline of human life. Human beings not only have these particularly ingenious techniques for fighting against nature, but also have certain strategies, which is to use nature itself to subdue nature. Although human beings themselves are weak animals, they can overcome nature by using excellent combat techniques and strategies that use nature to subdue nature in combat. This is the tactics and strategies that ordinary creatures do not know to study on the lifeline of life.</p>
<p>In social life, because human beings are divided into several layers of groups in a certain stage of social evolution, and even divided into individual people to live in different positions and interests, the battle between people is also universally developed in such a society. Human beings live in a society of individualistic and self-interested concepts and separate groups, and there are various types and forms of struggle at all times. Without struggle, there is no survival, so this kind of tactics and strategies in life are more complex in form, and they are naturally developed and become necessary for each group and individual to study. In fact, it is often obvious that in a society where individual economic systems exist, the most prominent is first of all the separate groups based on ethnic relations and political and economic governance, that is, between ethnic nation-states, which are always in a state of mutual opposition and struggle, which has produced the military, political, economic and other diplomatic tactics and strategies of ethnic nation-states. Whoever does not study these tactics and strategies, whoever is not good at using them, can cause diplomatic failure if it is small, and even ruin the survival of his nation and country if it is large. Especially in the era of the emergence of modern large nation-states, all citizens are brought into this competition and participate in the battle based on the tactics and strategies of the rulers.</p>
<p>In every ethnic nation-state, there are also conflicts between unequal social strata, forming the opposition between ununified groups, and fierce struggles occur from time to time. In terms of various political, economic, and social facilities, each has different political views for the sake of the interests of their own group in life. Each social group forms its own political party and fights with each other to win the leadership of the country. Therefore, in elections, in all state organs, in parliament, and even for all political orders and social facilities, each has its own political tactics and strategies. Moreover, its political party is dedicated to creating these tactics and strategies, and leading its group to use these tactics and strategies to fight. Therefore, in modern society, all people are also involved in the study and execution of these tactical and strategic tactics of private group interests.</p>
<p>As for individual private individuals? For the sake of life, in this society where individualism and self-interest develop, one must always plan for one's own life and interests and study tactics and strategies. For example, many people advance in the advancing era and retreat in the retreating era, and some even strongly violate the dominance of reason and change everything about themselves, making themselves seem like two different people. This can be said to be a kind of tactics and strategies carried out entirely for the sake of personal living interests.</p>
<p>Human beings cannot but fight to live, and they must study tactics and strategies anytime and anywhere to fight, so we do not oppose studying tactics and strategies anytime and anywhere, and even recognize that this is a necessity in life in society. However, in a divided world, we can only admit that the study of tactics and strategies by the weak is appropriate, because they simply cannot survive if they do not fight and do not study combat tactics and strategies. As for the future world, its struggle is directed solely at nature, so what human beings need to develop is science and production technology, that is, they need to study only the tactics and strategies of fighting against nature, and the tactics and strategies of fighting between people are not necessary in life.</p>

<h3 id="e207">How to Live a Wandering Life? <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Jianqun</p>
<p>In a wandering life, economic pressure, physical fatigue, and emotional distress are inevitable. However, if you can understand the meaning of "wandering" and know how to live a wandering life, you can reduce some of the suffering. Therefore, a wanderer, especially one who is just starting out, should learn the skills of wandering and pay attention to various subtleties. The saying "even begging requires a teacher" illustrates this point.</p>
<p>Some people are driven by life's pressures and have no choice but to travel around in search of employment. However, "traveling around" should not be aimless; it should be a planned "reliance." Before going to a certain place, you must ascertain the personnel relationships there. You should have at least a 50% certainty of securing a job. If you go there rashly, relying solely on new pursuits, problems are bound to arise. Even if the outcome doesn't lead to a dead end, the losses incurred will be significant. In reality, you must investigate the living conditions and the number of personal friends in that location in advance. This will facilitate planning your finances and prevent you from being stranded in a foreign land, wasting money and time, should employment issues arise.</p>
<p>Secondly, travel expenses are also a common difficulty for wanderers. Sometimes, opportunities to find employment may arise elsewhere, but due to a lack of funds, the opportunity is lost. Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with the transportation options. As far as I know, the "extra-stop trains" and "freight cars" on the Pinghan Railway do not charge fares. If you are in Hankou and urgently need to go to Beiping, you don't need to delay raising travel funds. You can take this cheap transportation, even if it's a bit uncomfortable. Also, the fares for fast and slow trains differ significantly. For example, from Shanghai to Nanjing, a special express train costs more than three yuan and seventy cents, while a fourth-class seat on a slow train costs only two yuan. The seating is sometimes not very crowded, and the delay is only about three hours. If you want to save money, it's best to take the slow train. However, you must pay close attention because there are many thieves on slow trains. They don't dare to venture into the special express trains, which are heavily guarded by military police, to steal from wealthy passengers. Instead, they target the poor friends riding the slow trains. Once they have an opportunity, they will not hesitate to take your only possession, regardless of your poverty. There are naturally many ways to prevent this, but you must understand the subtleties involved to avoid wasting effort. Before the ship sets sail and after it anchors are times when thieves "show their skills." You should watch your luggage and only relax after the ship has set sail. When riding a train, pay special attention to the first stop, as thieves often steal things while passengers are in confusion shortly after the train departs. They then get off at the first stop and return to the city. This is most evident on the Pinghan Railway because there are more thieves there than elsewhere.</p>
<p>During the journey, you may want to make a few honest friends. This will allow you to learn more about the destination, have someone to look after you along the way, and pass the time while relieving your sorrow and enlivening your mood. However, speak sincerely and avoid being frivolous, or others may mistake you for a "drifter" or a "traveling hustler." Before arriving at your destination, inquire about the names, addresses, and room rates of local hotels and inns to avoid confusion and unnecessary losses. You should also be aware of the conditions at the docks and the regulations for handling luggage; otherwise, being "gouged" and disrupting your budget can be quite a blow!</p>
<p>Wanderers should learn the languages of various regions in advance, at least enough to speak a few everyday phrases. This not only makes it easier to find employment but also</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>reduces many difficulties. Of course, learning the languages of different provinces cannot be achieved in a short period, but learning a few common essential phrases is easy. For example, rickshaws are called "yellow package cars" in Shanghai, "rubber skins" in Tianjin, simply "cars" in Chengdu, "foreign cars" in Qingdao and Beiping, cigarettes are called "tobacco sticks" in the north, "tobacco sons" in Guangzhou, and "paper cigarettes" in Sichuan... As long as you can say the names, you can reduce a lot of trouble. Even if your pronunciation is not perfect, others will still know you are a foreigner, but they won't dare to think of you as a newcomer.</p>
<p>As for the housing problem in a wandering life, it depends on your status and financial capabilities. It should also be appropriate for your activities and the social circles you frequent. If the friend you are "relying on" is a high-ranking official who cares about face, and the job you are seeking is also high-end, and the people you associate with are all elegant, then you have to stay in a mid-range or higher hotel to avoid being looked down upon for being poor, even if your travel funds are a little tight. However, you should also consider whether the job is reliable, or you will suffer later! In fact, wanderers do not have lavish social lives. For financial reasons, it is best to find affordable accommodation. If you want to live in Beiping for a month or two, it is best to find a suitable apartment that includes meals for about thirteen or fourteen yuan per month. Tea and water are readily available, and the service is attentive (there are many such apartments in both the east and west of the city), which is suitable for the status and tastes of wandering intellectuals. If you want to stay longer, you can rent your own house. A medium-sized one costs only two or three yuan per month. You can buy meal tickets for six or seven yuan per month. Living in Shanghai is about one-third more expensive than in Beiping. Taking apartments as an example, room and board together cost at least twenty-two or twenty-three yuan. If you are staying for a month or two, it is more cost-effective to rent a house. In remote areas, you can rent a small room in the attic for five yuan or a back room for three or four yuan. You can eat two meals at a workers' restaurant for two mao a day, which is about twelve yuan for the whole month. However, it is not easy to rent a house in Guangzhou or Hankou, and you also need family members and a guarantor. Therefore, people wandering in these two places can only stay in small inns. (In Guangzhou, in addition to the lavish "hotels," there are also "student residences" that are also used for average tourists. These lodgings cost about sixteen to twenty yuan per month). In short, the cost of living varies in different places, and the local conditions are different. Wanderers should investigate in advance and then drift in a planned way, to avoid unexpected difficulties in life.</p>
<p>In addition, common sense is also something that old wanderers should pay attention to. Here are a few examples. First, China's monetary system is extremely chaotic. Each province and county has several or even dozens of types of "currency" in circulation, but the area of circulation is limited. The "currency" used here often becomes useless in other provinces. The double hao coins commonly used in Shanghai are clearly made in Guangdong, but they are not accepted in Guangdong (where they are called "old hao coins" and new hao coins with the image of Mr. Sun Yat-sen are used). The hao coins of Nanjing are the same as those circulating in Shanghai, but those from the years 1920 and 1921 are not accepted. Sichuan's silver dollars—called "Sichuan version"—are permanently ineligible to leave the Kui Pass because they are said to be of poor quality and insufficient content. If you don't understand these "subtleties" and take "Sichuan version" to other provinces or hao coins from 1920 and 1921 to Nanjing, and you are short on travel funds, you may be in danger of starving. Second, customs inspections in Hong Kong are particularly strict, and "gouging" is especially severe. Fresh goods are taxed or confiscated, and even bringing more than one tin of cigarettes (preferably with the lid cut open) is subject to tax and a fine. If you don't understand these situations and bring a tin of cigarettes from Shanghai to Guangzhou as a gift for a friend, you may be unlucky! Third, the food on ocean liners is bad (it has stones and is gritty) and there are no vegetables. If possible, prepare some dry food before you leave. However, it is different when taking a train.

<h3 id="e208">From Positivism to Pragmatism <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuoran</p>
<p>Positivism is the philosophical system of Comte, while pragmatism is the philosophical system of James in the United States. Although these two philosophical systems have different points in terms of name and formal content, they have many things in common in terms of general ideological principles. From the perspective of external form, both are based on experience and practice, becoming a philosophy of empiricism. In Comte's view, the ultimate goal of human thought and what he can know is only the positive empirical facts and the laws they reveal. The noumenon of things is unknowable, and what is known is only the phenomenal things. However, knowing the laws of phenomenal things, they should serve mankind. The work of science is to empirically verify these things and laws, and to synthesize these things and laws, so that it can be transformed into a tool for serving mankind, and recognition and knowledge have value and are worthy of attention here. What about James' pragmatism? It is also roughly the same in this kind of thinking, not focusing on abstract theoretical debates, but focusing on the verification of real situations, and only in practice can right and wrong be determined. Therefore, the cognition and disputes of all truths are boundless and endless, and no results or values can be obtained there. What is truly valuable is only practicality. Everything that is practical is right, and vice versa is worthless and wrong. Therefore, pragmatism is also a philosophy of experience and hard work to a certain extent.</p>
<p>However, after positivism opposed all beliefs and fantasies of abstract thinking and principles, it stepped into the realm of Kantian agnosticism and Humean phenomenology. Because it believes that it is impossible to enter the scope of the noumenon, and the noumenon itself is unknowable. What we can know and should know is limited to the things in the phenomenal world. Even if things have a true essence, in terms of practical benefits, it may be completely irrelevant or even useless to human progress. When positivism reaches such a theoretical scope, it further includes in its philosophy the denial of the meaning of objective truth, because it believes that what can serve mankind is good, and there is no objective and absolute truth principle, and there is no unified entity based on the noumenon. It denies the possibility of cognition of the noumenon of things, denies the possibility of the existence of objective essence and truth, and takes the actual interests of human beings or its parts and even individuals as the premise to determine the value of everything. This is another form of human-centered philosophy. What about pragmatism? It also believes that all debates on principles and principles are empty and cannot reach ultimate differences, and even says that if differences cannot be verified in the practical scope, it is better to say that they are the same, without right or wrong. Therefore, we cannot know the essence of truth, or we can say that there is no truth at all. It believes that principles and systems are difficult to achieve, and only concrete things, achievable phenomenal expressions, actions and facts, etc., are what it pays attention to. True things are only in line with practicality, and practicality is based on human interests. Therefore, it not only believes that truth is difficult to distinguish, difficult to speak, and difficult to know, but also that it is worthless. To judge things, it is only necessary to rely on their actual manifestations, only to weigh right and wrong based on the practical interests of each person in their practice, without the need for any other principles and standards, so that disputes can be reconciled. In this way, pragmatism also contains agnosticism of things themselves. Its experience stops at the realm of phenomena and subjectivity, and does not reach the other shore of things. It is a denial of truth.</p>
<p>Originally, agnosticism of the thing-in-itself was Kant's dualistic philosophy. Because on the one hand, he admitted the existence of the noumenon of things, but in the sense that this noumenon of things is unknowable, he regarded the phenomena we feel and the consciousness reflected by these phenomena on our subjectivity as things that cannot completely identify and express the thing itself. Since the subjective acquisition of things cannot fundamentally express external things, these things are nothing but the products and illusions of the subjective mind, because it cannot be used as an explanation of external things, nor is it something produced by external things. Therefore, everything in the psychology is parallel to external things, unrelated and independently existing. Regardless of whether Kant simply admitted that the things in subjective consciousness were just psychological fabrications, the necessary logic of that agnosticism of the thing-in-itself is like this. Positivists and pragmatists do not know at all that the subjective depends on the objective, that thinking is produced by reality, and that everything in psychology is a reflection of the external reality. Therefore, it must explain external things to a certain extent. The progress of human knowledge means that the reflection of the outside world is becoming more and more realistic. The reason why science is science is also because it recognizes external things. External things are not unknowable, but their secrets are constantly being revealed. External things are truly existing, and knowledge of them is gradually acquired. Then, no matter how the outside world changes, this change is also the change of objective reality itself. Human beings obtain the reality of change from change, which is still objective truth. Truth is not only existent but also absolute in its objectivity. It is relative in its change due to the change of its own objective reality, but this cannot be used to deny the existence of truth. If it is said that there is no truth or truth is worthless, then the outside world is not real, and it is meaningless and worthless. Positivists and pragmatists advocate the importance of practice, which is correct from the standpoint of human beings themselves. Therefore, it is not impossible in principle to pay attention to everything that is practical and can promote human progress. However, human beings and their interests appeared very late, and they are only a part of nature, so it cannot be said that there is no universe and no truth outside of human beings, and that truth and the world are over when human beings do not exist. Moreover, the establishment of human self-demands and concepts also takes root in the external world of nature and society, and cannot be explained from human nature. If the opinions of positivism and pragmatism continue to develop, and objective truth and right and wrong are denied, then every person has his practical views, and various societies and individuals also have different practical viewpoints. Then, the guns and cannons of imperialism and the knives of oppressors are practical to them, and their oppression and slaughter become reasonable truths. On the contrary, the resistance of opponents is more reasonable. This not only becomes a theory that helps the wicked to do evil, but also its contradictions are really unsolvable.</p>
<p>If we examine the era in which positivism and pragmatism occurred, then they were after the establishment of modern society, when most people could not be satisfied with their original ideals, and thus society had a tendency to pursue other new ideals. Therefore, they had to come out to deny that the admiration of new ideals was reasonable, and call on everyone to be content with the status quo in the experiment, and even support things that had practical value for a few people. Of course, when it developed to the end, they themselves were disappointed with their society, and in the turmoil, they needed compromise and reconciliation. Therefore, on the one hand, they were pessimistic about the impossibility of the yearning for objective truth, and on the other hand, they had to find ways to obliterate the rationality of debate and fighting for truth, in order to live in the present reality and make people not go beyond the practical viewpoints of life trivia and partial events, and reconcile the existing contradictions and stop disputes. However, the progress of society has made it impossible for most human beings to seek any real interests. In the facts of real daily life, they cannot find any practical meaning for their own interests. The evidence of the situation only proves their pain. Therefore, the pursuit of new truth cannot be stopped, and this philosophy still cannot save the poor. Let some people promote the immediate real interests and temporality, oppose the pursuit of truth and move forward, and even deny that there is so-called objective truth. I am afraid it will not be of much use!</p>

<p>— Liu Yuqing</p>
<p>Shaoxing Correspondence</p>
<p>Shaoxing is not a very big county in Zhejiang Province, but from a historical point of view, it has always been famous throughout the country. The reason for its fame is, on the one hand, that during the Qing Dynasty, the footprints of "Shaoxing counselors" could be found in government offices everywhere, so the place became famous because of the people; on the other hand, it was because of the popularity of Shaoxing wine, and this small county became even more famous in the world. Regarding "Shaoxing counselors," there is no need to recall the past and say more nonsense. What I want to talk about is the booming and once prosperous Shaoxing winemaking.</p>
<p>There is no scenery or famous attractions in Shaoxing. If tourists from other places come here to explore and seek out hidden beauty, I guarantee that you will shake your head and sigh, shout "fooled" and go back. But if a person with a fondness for Li Bai comes here, I dare to guarantee that he will not want to go back. There are not many streets in Shaoxing, and there are no wide roads like in Shanghai, but the number of liquor stores accounts for 50 to 60 percent of all stores. As soon as you step on the street, all you see are signs with names such as "The Legacy of Taibai," "Chunyu Yishi," and "Liu Li Parking."</p>
<p>Since there are so many liquor stores here, the number of people who drink can be imagined. There are countless customers who like the style of Lu Xun's "Kong Yiji." Therefore, the layout of general liquor stores is also very casual because the "drunkard's intention" is indeed "in the wine." In a liquor store, in addition to a few tables and simple wine utensils, all you can see are wine jars. Even if they are busy with work, people who like to drink will still take time to sneak to the liquor store counter for a satisfying drink.</p>
<p>It is of course expected that Shaoxing people like to drink Shaoxing wine, but non-Shaoxing people also like to drink Shaoxing wine. This is why Shaoxing winemaking is superior to others. However, it can be said that there are places to make wine everywhere in China. So, why is Shaoxing wine so famous in the world? This is naturally for good reason. According to the analogy of winemakers: "Rice is the meat of wine, flour is the bone of wine, and water is the blood of wine." From this, we can see the importance of water in wine. It is said that Shaoxing wine became famous because of the help of Jian Lake water. Jian Lake is about three miles from Shaoxing and was built by Prefect Ma of the Han Dynasty. Although Jian Lake itself was later abandoned, many of the tributaries it formed have not changed. The most beautiful water in them is Qingti</p>
<h3 id="e210">How to Study History? <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Fu</p>
<p>Shirakawa Hakumura said in his "Symbols of Torment": "The development of everything progresses from simple to complex. Therefore, to understand the essence of a thing, one must first trace its origin and look back to its most authentic and simple original state." Human life is also "progressing from simple to complex"; if there were no feudal-era agriculture and handicraft life, or even if there were no primitive-era crude and simple life of drinking blood, then mankind would never be able to enjoy modern "civilized" life. Therefore, if we want to understand the present and predict the future, we must know where the present and even the future come from, in other words, we must study the past history.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "people are both the authors and performers of their own drama," so people not only live in society, but also are historical animals, "performers and authors of their own history." Our study of history is to study the past activities and creations of mankind, and at the same time, it is also to create the future history with the understanding of the past, and move towards the path of light. Therefore, as long as it is not a person who lives in a muddle, but a person who lives soberly and seriously, he must study the past, understand the present, and create his personal life in the creation of human history, that is, he must understand the past history, accept the experience of human past life, and thus consciously participate in the work of human creation of history, and play the most important role in promoting the progress of history on the stage of history.</p>
<p>So, how to study history? In the past, many of our historians only recorded the changes of dynasties, the words and deeds of the royal family, the life-long careers of heroes and their birth and death dates, while the lives of ordinary people and the changes in social economy were not their concerns. Dealing with history in this way can at most only know some facts about those upper-class figures who appeared on the stage of history, and is still at a loss about the past history. Therefore, our study of history cannot adopt this unscientific and useless method. We must find the causal law of historical development, examine the organizational forms of human society, and explore the driving force of social evolution, historical changes and progress, because only in this way can we reflect the causal law of objective historical development and change as our subjective law of historical research, so as to study history with this scientific method that conforms to history, and truly understand the past and create the future. Here we can draw this famous formula!</p>
<p>"In the social production of their life, people enter into definite, necessary relations, independent of their will, namely relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation on which legal and political superstructures arise and to which definite forms of social consciousness correspond. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – what is but a legal expression for the same thing – with the property relations within which they have hitherto operated. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed....”</p>
<p>According to this, we can see that the organization of society is based on economy, and the development and changes of history also appear with the development and changes of social economy. The political changes, rebellions and wars, changes in social thought, and changes of dynasties in the past history are all inseparably related to the social economic form, and are not absolutely accidental phenomena. As for the heroes who appeared on the stage of history, they all emerged due to the needs of society on a certain economic foundation, and they were definitely not the stars descending to the earth. Therefore, when we study history, we should not only know the changes of dynasties, the facts of rebellions and wars, but also understand the social roots of their occurrence; for those heroes, we should not only know their careers and living conditions, but also understand how they were produced under what social conditions, and what role they played in human society. Because only in this way can we truly understand history, understand the characters in history; so that we will not become vulgar historians who know what happened but do not know why.</p>
<p>Take the history of China as an example. In the past history of China, the most noteworthy historical facts, such as Qin Shihuang's annexation of the six countries, his policies of abolishing the feudal system and establishing counties and prefectures and burning books and burying Confucian scholars, Wang Mang's usurpation of the throne, and his revival of the well-field system, as well as the Huang Chao Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty, Wang Anshi's reform in the Ming Dynasty, the Wuxu Reform in the Qing Dynasty and even the Xinhai Revolution... and other major events were all produced under certain social systems and economic conditions, and were by no means accidental phenomena without roots. However, the historians of the past only recorded the process of these events, and did not investigate the root causes of them, so they did not make correct explanations of these historical facts; sometimes, they even did not hesitate to use their own prejudices and adopt the so-called "praise and criticism" method to unreasonably scold those characters who were not approved by them, such as Qin Shihuang, Wang Mang and even Wang Anshi and others, were often scolded by general moralists. But dealing with history in this way resulted in not only not knowing the reason of history, but also probably making the facts inexplicable. Look at our Twenty-Four Histories, probably none of them really explained history. Therefore, we must use new methods to study history and reorganize the social history of China. For us, all the facts in the past history are not only objectively existing, but also have certain social roots, so we must find the roots of those historical facts from the social point of view, so as to explain those historical facts. We neither laugh nor cry, and we do not adopt the "praise and criticism" method of the moralists, we just objectively study history and explain history from the social point of view. For example, Qin Shihuang's abolition of the feudal system and the establishment of counties and prefectures and burning books and burying Confucian scholars, which is generally scolded by moralists, but for us, for general scientific historical researchers, Qin Shihuang's unification of the world, breaking the situation of feudal division, and establishing a centralized government was due to the development of commercial capital, which is still progressive; as for Qin Shihuang's burying of Confucian scholars, it was burying those feudal students who opposed the new society and attempted to retreat, and did not bury all the scholars, in fact, the scholars of Xunzi's school at that time, such as Li Si, were not buried, so we cannot simply scold Qin Shihuang when studying history because we see Qin Shihuang's burning books</p>

<p>The task of the Confucian facts is forgotten, which is the attitude we should take when studying history.</p>
<p>The following is considered the basic method of studying history. Under this basic method, we must find materials to carry out research. The so-called historical materials are nothing more than: 1. books that record history, 2. antiques unearthed from underground, and 3. folk songs and legends. However, in many past materials, especially in many past materials in China, many are forged, so that when Mr. Qian Xuantong studied Chinese history, he changed his name to Yigu Xuantong. When collecting materials, one must distinguish between true and false, and cannot use them randomly. In addition, there are many problems in sorting out materials and engaging in writing. But due to space limitations, I have to skip it.</p>
<p>Special report</p>
<h3 id="e211">Overseas Chinese in the World (10) <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>In addition, there are many important places in the Far East where there are many overseas Chinese, but due to various reasons, I have to skip it.</p>
<p>4.  Overseas Chinese in Europe</p>
<p>Although my country has had commercial relations with European countries for a long time, until now, there are only two or three thousand overseas Chinese in the whole of Europe. The situation of overseas Chinese in various parts of Europe is described below.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>In France, in addition to students studying abroad, there are very few pure businessmen and workers. The very few Chinese businessmen among them mostly open antique shops, hotels, restaurants and grocery stores here; their capital is also very small, so it can be said that there is no position in the business world. Li Shizeng, the current member of the Central Committee, and others once founded a tofu company in Paris when they were in France, making Chinese tofu famous in the world; but this company has now been closed, and the reason is probably the lack of managers. As for the Chinese workers in France, most of them were recruited by the French in China during the European War; many of these Chinese workers were sent back to China after the war, so the Chinese workers who are still living in France now are only sailors in Marseille and factory workers near Paris, and the number is only two or three hundred. In addition, there are about one or two thousand Chinese students scattered in Paris, Lyon and other places. However, the mobility of these students is very high, and there are increases and decreases at any time, so it is difficult to determine the number of people.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Among the overseas Chinese in Europe, Germany is the most numerous besides France. There are about six or seven hundred Chinese businessmen in Berlin and other places. In addition, there are about sixty or seventy Chinese sailors who travel between Shanghai and Berlin and do small business. As for our students studying in Germany, there are also about five or six hundred people. In total, there are only about one thousand overseas Chinese in Germany, and they are not very important in all aspects.</p>
<p>United Kingdom</p>
<p>There are only about one thousand overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom. They all live in London, Liverpool and other places. Some of them are sailors and some are workers; those in Liverpool are mostly laundry workers. Because there are very few people, they are not very important in all aspects, so the British do not pay much attention to the overseas Chinese in the UK, and at the same time, the overseas Chinese in the UK can live peacefully, although their lives are relatively poor.</p>
<p>Other countries</p>
<p>In addition to France, Germany and the United Kingdom, countries such as the Soviet Union, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Poland, Australia, and Portugal also have traces of overseas Chinese; the most numerous among the overseas Chinese in these countries are sailors, workers and students studying abroad, but there is no accurate statistic on how many people there are now. If we talk about the number of overseas Chinese in the whole of Europe, it is about twenty to thirty thousand; among them, workers and sailors are the most numerous, followed by students, and businessmen are the least.</p>
<p>5.  Overseas Chinese in the Americas</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>When it comes to the Americas, of course, the United States is the representative; so we should start talking about overseas Chinese in the Americas from the United States.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the United States is a capitalist country that has risen relatively late but has developed the fastest. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the United States was in need of labor, many Chinese workers went there. After the discovery of the California gold mine, the number of Chinese people going to the United States increased day by day. According to statistics, 1890 was the period with the largest number of overseas Chinese in the United States, reaching 107,488 people. Later, due to the competition of white people, the number of overseas Chinese in the United States gradually decreased. In addition, with the various restrictions imposed on overseas Chinese by the US government, as of now, overseas Chinese in the United States have shown no promising future. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e214">Tianyi's "Sea Burial" Location Shooting Team Work Record <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>Today we are active again on the north side of Shidao.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu pushed the small cart and followed the fishermen into the city. The fishermen on the island were all unreasonable. Director Wang kindly explained to them, but they always seemed to be uncontrollable, so it took a lot of time to shoot this great scene.</p>
<p>On the road of the Yagang, Tian Fang pushed the cart, Xiao Fu supported it, and Xiao Chen pulled the rope in front. The three were covered in sweat and it was very hard. Under the tense atmosphere, Xiao Chen was still eating his big cake. Tian Fang was panting, and his facial expression seemed even more gloomy. Baolu's movements were powerful everywhere, which was really beautiful.</p>
<p>Fang Pei, a girl with pigtails, and her neighbor, Li Ying, walked barefoot, exposing their thighs and squatting on the reefs on the beach to pick up aphids? From the distant waves, the floating corpses of dead people vaguely appeared. Li Ying suddenly had an inspiration and thought of her husband who had not returned from fishing. She stared blankly at the sky and secretly prayed: "Dragon King, please bless my husband!" But the floating corpse on the sea turned out to be her husband. She changed her attitude and cried wildly.</p>
<p>Innocent and lovely Fang Pei, she didn't seem to have anything at all, and she wouldn't comfort her sister.</p>
<p>The work of this location shooting was extremely difficult, which made everyone working very worried. The crabs on the stone reefs were as sharp as knives. They who worked in the water all had bleeding wounds. Director Wang was a man of ten, so his wounds were more than others. Old Jiang Wei Pengfei went to the sea wearing his pants, and cameraman Shen Yongshi also struggled with the sea regardless of his life.</p>

<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>"The Tempest" contains: "The Tempest of Life", the tempest of society, and the "Tempest" of the times.</p>
<p>"The Tempest" reveals the gloomy facts in the tempest era, and provides a way for people to struggle in the tempest era!</p>
<p>There is no decadent song, only the sound that stirs your emotions and represents your cry.</p>
<p>Here are the symphonies of cannons and guns that are demonstrating to us, and the ice cream of thick thighs and breasts that are anesthetizing us!</p>
<p>"The Tempest" is full of the elements necessary for stimulation, tension and moving art.</p>
<p>"The Tempest" has new faces and new techniques.</p>
<p>The main theme of "The Tempest" is: fighting for the country and bleeding for justice!</p>
<p>In "The Tempest" there is at the same time: a sweet song and dance is played on one side, and a realistic tragicomedy of the survival of the fittest is played on the other.</p>
<p>"The Tempest" is Mr. Yuan Nongmei's work on the road to success!</p>
