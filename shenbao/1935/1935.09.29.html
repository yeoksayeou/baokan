<h3>歐洲政治家的難題</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>自從上次大戰以來。今日是歐洲政治家遇到最大的難題的一天。一九二三年法國的佔據魯爾。情勢雖然嚴重。却不似今日的牽涉廣大。當時歐洲的局勢。猶似初爆發後的火山。雖人心惶惶。但未未有重復發火的可能。今日則似已熄的火山漸見復活。其蘊藏的爆發力。已非常可畏。意阿糾紛轉而成英意的對壘。籠罩於日內瓦外交舞臺的秋雲。也突然凝聚爲地中海上的殺氣。近數月來。英國雖老練圓滑的鮑爾溫。霍爾代替麥唐納及西門。法國外相賴伐爾雖往來遊說。疲於奔命。而局勢終未打開。今日英法當局正似受到政治外交課上最難的問題的測騐。然而在意國方面。墨沙里尼表面上雖始終强硬。在心頭必然橫有同樣的難題。內部的危機須要應付。對外的冒險難有把握。今日意軍已經調動完畢。照軍略上利於速戰。然而張弓不射。也自有其苦衷的。</p>
<p>簡言之。今日已洲政治家一遇。到的最大的解題。是戰爭的牽涉範圍與最後結果的無把握。英國所顧慮的。楚一旦戰爭爆發。展印航路必先被阻斷。央國非洲的領十將感受威脅。甚至引起殖民地的叛變。造成帝國的瓦解。也未可知。法國所抱的恐懼。是戰爭發動後對於中歐的影響。因爲意國若有事於紅海之中。其後方的多瑙河流域必甚空虛。野心的德國正可乘機進圖奧國。威脅法境。凡爾賽和約所造成的局面。由此將破碎無遺。而中的混戰的結果。史是不堪設想的。在意國方面。這種情形它也是明瞭的。實際說。墨沙里尼對於東非戰爭的結果。也很少把握。對於紅海和地中海上英國勢力的干涉。更懷着顧慮。但他的最大難題。在於戰爭步驟一日中途停止。內部的危機將如何渡過。數月以來。意國內部一切已變成戰時的組織。國家銀行的金準備减少。里拉貶値。失業工人被移置於東非前線。愛國熱隱蔽了人民的生活的困頓。若突然回頭。則現實的危機就畢露了。目前意國確有淮退維谷騎虎難下之勢。馮氏所以一次次宣佈一年來意軍所用於東非的鉅大費用。目的就任說明其苦衷。表示不得相當代價。便有難以歇手之苦。</p>
<p>英國對於當前的難題。曾經屢次試提問答案。在艾登訪問羅馬叭。曾提議以阿國南部的奧加登地方劃歸意國。由英國以英領索馬里蘭的齊拉港補償阿國的損失。當巴黎三國會議召集時。英國又主張以一九一六年的英意密約爲根據。把阿國分割成英意法的勢力範圍。而這次國聯大會中。霍爾又表示殖民地的原料儘可以和平分派。不必用武力奪取。法國則處於英意之問。爲雙方說。但墨沙里尼似平覺得英國所出的代價。都不足以解决意國本身的難題。墨氏自擬的答案。是把阿國淪爲意國的保護國。但是却又成為英國所不能接受的難題了。</p>
<p>據最近的電訊。地中上述顯然戰霎密佈。而意國態度似乎巳稍轉軟一些。國聯的委員會也在絕望中恢復一些活動。打算再找得一個圓滿的答案了。同時有意國方面。傳說墨沙里尼的地位。有趨於援動之勢。這種消息是否可靠。很難斷言。為我們可以認定。目的歐洲政治上的難題。實在很少有澈底解决的希望。今日歐洲的政治家在對內對外的政策上。和大戰以前的根本沒有差別。這是一切難題的根源。要解决他們的難題。祇有從根本的改革上着手。否則一九一四年的慘劇。遠是要重演一次的。</p>

<h3>海外近訉</h3>
<p>— （瞿世蕃譯）</p>
<p>黑白力之比較</p>
<p>德國銷行最盛之醫藥雜誌，執全世界醫藥刊物之牛耳，常有種種科學上新發現之記載，其力足以左右醫藥界之趨勢，最近載有一篇極有價值之論文，文係醫學博士沙曼克斯氏所撰之報告，引起歐洲醫藥界之絕大注意，蓋沙氏會搜羅世界各國最著名之治療白濁專藥，凡二百十九種，其中有原料，有成藥，有注射液劑，有特效新藥，沙氏欲於中用寶騐方法，選取其最迅速最完善之一種，加以種種之研究，其試騐方法，頗有足稱的者，沙氏聘請學識豐富之著名醫學博士及醫師多人爲助，開一盛大之試騐會，沙氏取所蓄同樣壯健之白鼠二百十九頭，依次編號，以白濁雙球菌移殖於其泌尿器部，八小時後，此二百十九頭之白鼠，即患同樣之白濁，沙氏即以此二百十九種之藥品，囑以一一分別令其治療，沙氏即靜候聽取其助手之報告，結果先呈上報告者，爲管理第八十一號白鼠之霍遜姆博士，霍氏之言曰，吾所司者爲第八十一號白鼠，如命飼以一種黑色之LODELEN（譯者按即德國樂的能）該白鼠身上所殖之淋濁，獲迅速撲滅之效，今該白鼠身上，已無淋菌之踪跡，蓋LODELEN（樂的能）入胃溶解後並不發揮藥力，直達於腸，方始溶解，由腸壁吸收入於膀胱，變爲一種含有藥力之藥尿，滲透各部粘膜，將膀胱內及尿道前後部，泌尿器生殖器之各部淋菌，盡行撲滅，一掃而空，體內所有之死菌即盡隨藥尿排出於體外云云，</p>
<p>顯微鏡下之奇蹟</p>
<p>沙氏取霍氏所呈之試騐管中八十一號白鼠所排之尿，用顯微鏡騐視，果如所云，嗣後絡績呈上報告者，凡四十三起，惟均不能收迅速之目的，且有種種缺點，沙氏乃命將此四十四種藥品，一一設法溶成液汁，各注以淋菌，命各取顯微鏡檢查其殺菌之情態，沙氏則親自試騐LODELEN（樂的能），結果，不能再兩小時內達到殺菌之目的者，凡有二十八種之多，而最速奏效者，不過七種，仍以沙氏親自試騐之LODELEN（樂的能）首先奏效，其餘六種，淋菌再其液汁內，猶能作頗強之抵抗，直至五十分鐘後，始見淋菌漸呈不振狀態，而沙氏則親見淋菌在LODELEN（樂的能）液內，未十分鐘，即無從掙扎而死，</p>
<p>粘膜後活躍之怪態</p>
<p>沙氏既發現治白濁之特效藥LODELEN（樂的能）後，並不即據以爲滿足，必欲窮究其藥理，乃取染有淋菌之白鼠一頭，剖取其一部分之粘膜，分爲十六小片，分取此兩小時內科達到殺菌目的之十六種藥品，涂其粘膜之一面，於顯微鏡下得見能盡行殺盡粘膜兩面之淋菌者，祗有一種，即此LODELEN（樂的能）而已，另有三種，則須於一小時後，始呈漸漸滲透之跡，此時淋菌得從容逸避於藥力未達後小時之一部內，而淋菌之繁殖率殊速，結果，粘膜後之淋菌，非惟未會撲滅，且更滋多，故惟一LODELEN（樂的能）以中國，雖淋菌深入粘膜後，即取其沖淡之溶液試之，亦得奏同樣之效果，　是沙氏引爲無上滿意云，</p>
<p>醫院中之實騐情形</p>
<p>自沙氏發表其報告後，各醫院中即競起作種種之實騐，當將患者或用舊日所慣用之藥，或用LODELEN（樂的能），作一比較之統計，則發現想向日所視爲不易迅速治愈之重症白濁，LODELEN（樂的能）能達到迅速治愈之功，等於以舊日所慣用之藥治輕症白濁，而LODELEN（樂的能）治輕症或新染之白濁，則迅速遠超舊藥，無與倫比，試取患者之尿騐之，則其尿色變成藍色，中有多量之死菌，被殺排出，第二次復取尿騐之，則含濁漸稀，約六七次後，尿色澄清，顯示淋菌已完全絕跡云，</p>
<p>白濁治法種種及利弊</p>
<p>嗣後醫藥雜誌上，討論白濁治療法者，囂囂跟上，中有杜美寶博士，痛論向日治療淋濁種種舊法之非，其警句有云：</p>
<p>（洗條法）……此乃最不合理想之療法也，當將藥水注入時，淋菌隨流而深入尿道後部，既於凹處及纖細之管中，反更不易搜捕撲滅之矣，是不管送淋菌升堂入室也，……</p>
<p>（電療法）……此法因流弊之多，故亦難逃笨拙之斥責，何則，蓋以其不明投鼠忌器之理也，……如所用電流微弱，則徒使淋菌得溫暖舒適之熱度，助其滋育繁殖，活躍猖獗，如所用電流過強，則不惟皮膚灼痛，苦楚難堪，且不足以深達睪丸精囊等纖巧組織之內，倂不能殺其附近粘膜後所潛伏之淋菌，否則電力過猛，淋菌精虫，玉石俱焚，後嗣有關矣，……</p>
<p>（注射法）……此法缺點甚多，蓋注射之後，隨血流週游全身，力既減薄，且其他各部，受此藥之直接刺戟，發生種種副作用矣，……</p>
<p>（內服法）……此法昔日所慮者，一，在入胃即化，與胃液素起一種化學作用，藥力既變，對胃經亦引起妨礙，二，在藥力不能透膜，徒事膚淺之表面工作，無由奏全功，三，再對於纖巧生殖組織，發生同樣攻擊，對於將來子嗣問題，關係綦重。自沙曼克斯博士發表LODELEN（樂的能）療法後，余會作種種試騐，並無上述流弊，洵屬萬種萬妥，無懈可擊云，</p>
<p>在德國紅極一時之　LODELEN（樂的能）</p>
<p>自醫藥雜誌詳細討論白濁之治法，及發表白濁之唯一特效專藥LODELEN（樂的能）後，於是試騐者報告者風起雲湧，而LODELEN（樂的能）既被萬種讚美，遂紅極一時，德國杜斯謙化學藥廠日夜加工監製，大有應接不暇之勢，而東西各國，亦紛將大批LODELEN（樂的能）備足，以供醫院治療，病家採用根治白濁之需云，</p>
<p>剷除淋病大運動</p>
<p>德國自經沙曼克斯博士發現迅速治愈白濁之特效專藥LODELEN（樂的能）後，一時醫師聯合委員會有一種驚人之大企圖，擬用種種方法，使民眾知治療之捷徑，盡行速即服用LODELEN（樂的能）以達治療，俾使德國境內，無一枚白濁變球菌之存在，有之，其惟醫院之化騐室內玻璃管中而已，</p>
<p>LODELEN（樂的能）　在中國</p>
<p>LODELEN（樂的能）之功效，自德國醫藥雜誌披實沙曼克斯博士之實騐報告後，於是震驚全球，但該藥初非新出之品，第經沙氏之實騐後，更證其有宏偉之確效而已，查LODELEN（樂的能）再寰球行銷，已由五十餘年之光榮歷史，治愈患者，不下千萬，自沙氏實騐後，患者更能恍然於其藥理，增其信譽，則今日之風行，自在意中，故中國各大藥房，莫不常時備足，以供患者需求，將來或將更進一步，繼德國而發起剷除淋病之大運動，亦未可知也，</p>
<p>LODELEN（樂的能）　之偉效</p>
<p>譯者按德國LODELEN（樂的能）一種褐色之藥丸，其配製上之原料，極盡珍秘，用特殊之方法，外包膠囊，吞入胃中，立即融化，但其內之藥力，入腸始溶解，被腸壁吸收，直達膀胱，發展其撲滅淋菌之功用，一方面其藥理能滲透泌尿器之各部粘膜，將其所潛匿之淋菌，流行殺滅，一方面其藥力再尿中，化為藥尿，能將藥尿經過處所有之淋菌，盡行撲滅，並即隨尿排出體外，且除透膜殺菌之外，復有利尿，去炎，消腫，鎮疼，防腐，生新等效，使患者一掃向日所患之痛苦，獲種種之舒適，且能於最短期間，恢復原來之健康狀態，較之細滌，電療，注射，及一切劣藥，洵有天壤之別，凡我同胞，如有患之者，幸速行購服療治，莫再沈淪苦海，犧牲康健幸福也，</p>

<h3>上海附近　發現古陶片確信</h3>
<p>（一）金山發現陶片　此發現向未發表於仟何刊物、因此刻僅能從事初步的調查、本年七月間爲某君昆仲初次見到、八月間張鳳先生僅參加第二次調查、九月間衛聚賢黃中英蔣大沂金祖同四先生同張鳳先生央到彼視察一過、爲第三次調查、此時正在分頭研究、尙未到發表時期、所謂周康王或楚康王城之說、未能確定、且金山衛城並未湮沒、與遺址無疑、至上海史蹟之見於典籍者、不僅始於唐代、尤與金山海濱之陶片遺址無關、此不能連牽而言者也、</p>
<p>（二）眞茹陶片之發見此種發見、已見本月中時報通訊、最初蔣大沂君廢十餘次之苦力、發現五六片、後由張鳳先生之女兒張祥女士發見二片、此吿無關典要、僅可作研究之參考、與衛聚賢先生無關、</p>
<p>（三）梵王渡大夏大舉附近之陶片此完全不是事實、張鳳先生絕對不會參加、有之、惟有於二十二年二月間張鳳衛聚賢、先生、曾在上海以外之莊家涇、拾到漢陶片、亦見時報、莊家涇與梵皇渡、路經不同、此不能以誤傳誤者也、昨自衛君發出不妥當的新聞後、不勝責斥、負氣中止調查、所以現在金山陶片遺址之調查工作，仍由最初發見人委托張鳳先生負責研究、其餘半途參加或參觀人之推想假設、概行保留、</p>

<h3>華豐麫粉廠　葉山濤等被控案訉結　徐冠南昨始投案述退股經過　工人希望尙奢下星期六宣判</h3>
<p>華豐麫粉廠於本年三月間突然停工、全體工人二百四五十名、當時由該廠股東葉山濤仍命留住廠內、供給食宿、謂將籌備復業、直至八月十一日、忽停發維持生活費、通吿遣散、而工人卽起抗爭、始則愬諸市黨部社會局及總工會、繼乃委任律師韋維清等對該廠股東葉山濤·徐冠南·盧少棠·提起詐欺背信之刑事自訴、迭經第一特區地方法院傳審、除盧少棠因侵占通商銀行數十萬</p>
<p>鉅欵逃避</p>
<p>外祗葉山濤業已投案、而徐冠南則以年邁衰頹、迄未到庭受鞠、昨日午後、由馮世德推事開庭續審、徐才與葉同詣法庭、馮推事馬向徐訊據供稱、彼已於二十年六月二十日、脫離華豐股東關係、祇以當時忽略、未將退股情形、呈報實業部、致迄猶被認爲股東、自退股後、更不預問廠務、所有退股證據、前因另案繳存法院云云、次據原吿工人孫仁平供稱、我等每度與葉交涉、葉輙言徐</p>
<p>亦係股東</p>
<p>曷不找徐、且法院判决該廠另案亦承認徐冠南爲股束、故我等遂根據而起訴云、昔受該廠僱用時、並未訂定期限、而此次停工之前、復毫無宣示、詎至三月四日、突由廠長宣吿停工、當時並不將我等遣散、留住廠內謂將復工、而今忽驟然停供火食、一律解僱、自食其言、形同欺騙、故尙須向索留廠六閱月之損失等語、質之被吿葉山濤、否認曾</p>
<p>對工人言</p>
<p>徐冠南係股東及着令找徐之事、並稱彼於三月間、因該廠總理盧少棠早已逃避、故暫代表赴社會局進行調解、斯時傅筱庵等决集資六十萬接辦該廠、始將工人留住廠內、籌欵維持、至七月底因見無復業希望、遂通吿遺散、該廠被盧挪欠甚鉅、去年歲尾、已經岌岌可危、當以存麥猶多、勉力支持、至三月四日、麥盡成粉、遂予停工也、旋卽開始辯論、先由原吿律師陳述被吿應負詐欺背信罪責之理由、謂當停工之際、廠存</p>
<p>多量麫粉</p>
<p>工人因覺足敷斛僱金之需、故予扣留、葉欲變賣該項麫粉、遂即發給三月份工資外、允許復工、工人以旣有復工希望、當將所扣麫粉交給、倘葉於彼時將工人解僱、則工人對僅發一月工資、决不滿意而麫粉未必輕易爲被吿所賣、此卽葉對付工人詐欺背信之手段、原吿律師復提出社會局最近之批示、謂該批示除着被吿發給一月工資外、每名再各發川資十五元、關於工人要求賠償</p>
<p>六月損失</p>
<p>一點、命另投法院起訴、葉亦續稱、着再各發一月工資、業已備就欵項、至尙需每人十五元之川資、實無力籌措失、葉之辯護律師隨起而爲葉聲辯、以該廠總理爲盧少棠、而此次停工、更由廠長命令、至麫粉之抵償債務、則係社會局决定、復工之不能實現、由於接辦者之無意經營、均屬與葉無涉、請求判葉無罪、末由徐冠南之律師陳霆銳·陳明徐氏退股之種種事實舉、庭諭除盧少棠被訴部份停止審判外、葉·徐·退候下星期六下午宣判、</p>

<h3>滬港埠際綱球第一日　上海二比零佔先　今日再勝一組卽得錦標　昨女子雙打亦為滬隊勝　今日徐惠培戰林寳華</h3>
<p>滬港埠際網球泰格德杯賽、昨日下午一時半在法商總會球塲揭幕、男子組單雙打各一、女子雙打一祖、競賽結果、上海隊以極雄厚之實力、全勝三塲、港隊女子雙打之失敗、最爲可惜、男子組上海旣已勝二組、今日冉勝一塲、即可保持錦標、女子組形勢看來尙未能决定、昨日觀者甚盛、約計當在近千人也、比賽結果列下、</p>
<p>男子組</p>
<p>女子組</p>
<p>林邱雙打輕取李徐</p>
<p>男子雙打林寶華邱飛海是沙塲老將、其獲勝固屬意料中事、惟李惠堂雖屬半途出家、其球藝亦多可取、發球尙稱銳利、反手抽球尤有心得、常能在出其不意中、擊出奇球、惜徐潤培過於軟弱、合作未臻佳境、此其致敗之因、第一盤中李惠堂發揮先獲一局、繼林邱連勝五局、其勢甚盛、第七局雖爲港隊扳回、奈太勢已去、卒以六比二爲滬佔先、第二盤李徐力圖恢復、努力抗拒、造成各為平局後、又連失二局、旋見惠堂以發球之犀利獲一局、但又爲林邱收回、是盤又以六比四爲滬隊勝、第三盤中李徐先獲局林邱連下五局、大勢巳去、港隊無法挽回、卒以六比三見敗、總數爲三比零滬勝、</p>
<p>女子雙打港方惜敗</p>
<p>繼之女子雙打出塲、港隊威爾遜夫人騎悍異常、攔網高壓、頗具功夫、漢柯克小姐長袖雖有可取、但動作呆滯、常使威氏大唱獨脚戲、滬隊兩員老將、年俱不小、摩爾勇敢善戰、頗見老到、哈力斯髮已花白、尙能從恿應付、殊爲難得、莫合人發球、但採上托式、可稱無獨有偶、第一盤威爾遜夫人發球、港隊先取二局、滬隊收回一局後、又連失兩局、循環往復、以六比二、第一盤港隊佔先、第二盤形勢仍港佔優勝、威爾遜夫人近攻遠擊、飛舞滿塲、其表演之精彩、全塲掌聲雷動、造成五比三之優勝局面、港隊勝剎在握、第九局中已函四三之比數、再來一下、即可定奪、奪漢柯克小姐、輕輕自殺二下、遂爲滬隊直下三局、轉敗爲勝、乃以七比五收回第二盤、最後一盤勝負所繫、港隊先以二個渭四、連取一局、滬隊扳回二局後、威爾遜夫人大顯神威、又連取一局、造成五比日局面、衆料港隊必勝無疑、誰知漢柯克小姐不帮忙、屢次失着、威夫人獨脚難撑、滬隊乘機連吞六局、乃以七比十吿終、滬隊以二比一獲勝、</p>
<p>何家鎏力戰卡爾生</p>
<p>最後一塲男子第一單打、卡爾生與何家鎏、竟以四盤猛鬥、才分勝負、大出於意料之外、家鎏之表演、亦特別小心、能奔走、從容應付、底綫長抽、較這年前代表港埠時、已進步多處、卡爾生表演、不如往日之佳、自殺之後、亦復不出、家鎏苦門之下、最後一盤、卒以精力不繼四敗、第一盤雙方競爭劇烈、屢成平局、卡爾生神威大發、以七比九佔先、第二盤家鎏奮力抵禦、惜有守無攻、又以六比四爲卡爾生獲勝、第三盤卡爾生勝利在握、不免大意、遂爲家鎏以七比五收回、第四盤家鎏漸以氣餒、蹶不振、卡連下六局、勝負遂定、</p>

<h3>小男兒（六）（〇）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「現在，下去吃晚餐，要勉力做好，我的孩子，多只是爲你自己，而不是爲我們的。」裴先生就和他握手，唐恩於是下了樓去，此時却被慈愛的精神所完全馴服，假如裴先生照了亞西所竭力慫勇的一頓好好的痛打做去，其成績必不能有這麽美好的。</p>
<p>唐恩努力了一二天，可是他對這個太不慣了，所以他不久便覺得厭倦，重復墮入了他率性逕行的老魔道。有一天裴先生有事外出，童子們因而無課。他們不免覺得高興，起勁玩了一天，等到要安眠的時候，多數童子都各自回到房裏，酣然入睡去了。可是唐恩的頭腦裏却有一個計劃，等到他獨自和乃德在一塊時他就發表他的計劃。</p>
<p>「這裏，看！」他說道，隨即從他床下取出一個瓶，一枝雪茄，和一摺的紙牌，「我想要拿來的，還有這枝雪茄；你可以代我去還鈔，或者鞱摩去還，他是個財主，我一文也沒有。我要去請他來；—還是你去罷，他們對你是不忌的。」</p>
<p>「裴伯伯裴媽媽要不高興的，」乃德開始說道。</p>

<p>九月標紗交割及其經過</p>
<p>九月期標紗、在本年四月一日上市價爲一百八十一元六角、漸漸漲至百八十三元五角、旋以春銷失望、世界棉業狀况致傾向衰落、兼之美國買行收買現銀政策、吾國物價受其打擊、同時滬埠金融風潮激盪、銀行錢莊相繼倒閉者不少、致商業異常蕭條、外商大批拋空、壓迫尤重、市價步卜、跌風日熾、直綫下瀉至七月十二日、最低價曾見一百六十二元七角、在此代低價時一度盤旋、目紗廠皆受營業困難、停廠减工者日多、生產量大减、長沙都對於倉庫中籌碼物首先搬運、於是市况顯著否極泰來之熱、新買者積機活躍、市塲謠誌遙起、通貨問題、舊事重擔、七月二十九日發現眾人之漲風、多方心思狂熱一日間跳起五元外、最高峰爲一百七十九元六角、豈料價高後有碍實銷、目通貨膨脹事件、全屬子虛、忽轉下墮、重破入七十元關門、爲六十七元四角、延至最近、多頭方面、鑒於秋銷發展、决意收貨、市價保持穩定、最後一盤價爲一百七十四元、角、比八月期收盤價之一百六十五元六角、泓高八元八角、結果三日扯交割價爲一百七十四元、交貨為籌碼有七千五百包、殘餘七千八百包、其中兩存賬有一千一百包、實行交割僅四千五百包、貨品計二十支全鷄一千七百包十七支十六支富貴紗爲二千八百包、收貨達記·賡豐·錦昌三家爲主體、交貨裕大通記元一三家均旺、茲再列表如下、</p>

<h3>美新棉走動遲延</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况呆滯、各月漲一二磅音、新客戶不多、所有交易、限於套賣與同業買進、初以上日南方套賣、市盤盤旋不前、旋以本地帮買進及空戶抵補、奧克拉霍馬及潘海特爾預備有霜降、略形堅家、卒以套賣增加再軟、現藝平和、脚地尙硬、賣戶不多、尤以西部爲最、因該處近受雨量之影饗、致部棉走動遲延、海斯德氏估計本週廠用為一九〇、〇〇包、利物浦存底爲一一一、〇〇〇包、收盤平穩、現貨漲十磅音、期貨跌四至六磅音、英棉現貨漲點、期貨漲二點、印棉日商略有買進、散戶多頭了結、計平果雨奧姆辣及其羅溪均漲四分之羅比、原電錄左、（二十七日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十八日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為一百零四羅比、較上日收盤跌一·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉麥皆為菲而昂</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、又見挺俏、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲八分至一角零、坎拿大小四分、市塲人心、以本月份爲最後一天交易、初頗平定、旋因浮空抵補、又稍俏利、至大部分籌碼、聞際收解者、計達二三十萬包、啟交割數量、當在二十餘萬包左右、至遠期各月份、以彙阿有絕望之跡象、對外人心、又復重振、即好二三分、迨至下午開盤、本月份變方了結、出入無幾、遠期出廠方套售、形勢又轉相緩、客帮交易、未見暢旺、究屬銀根關係、有隨銷隨買之勢、</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、一致回振、雖洋來報價、上落甚微、不過業外買戶、鋻於東菲形勢、迄未見鬆、未來之洋麥來源、必有問題、是以買戶漸見熱奮、各月份即好四六分不等、下午各盤、交易尙暢、價則盤旋、目下一般人之推測、均側重国外消息之良否、是以變化亦不能預測也、現麥市面、仍日擯局、高貨喊四元、中次照降、開山東麥四元、明光麥三元九角六分、漢口麥三元九角二分、由福新夫四千包、信大去五百包云、</p>
<h3>洋米產價步昂　西貢暹邏均達六元　西買暹滬均達六元</h3>
<p>昨日洋米交易甚淡、因北帮日前虧存各米尙未完全裝清、而本街以河下米與客秈利頭甚旺、進胃亦貪取、惟國外市價步砌、後定終難台劃、前電西貢一號米每百斤五元七角半、而十日洋行得電已大至六元、因此貨主更爲望好、市價交易回落、但全日祇開西貢一三號及暹邏元米五百多包、由本街辦去、</p>
<p>客秈連日到頭不絕、昨甬米到頭較多、其他各米亦有續到、而本街進胃不濃、客戶不動、甬米急於求脫、中關貨立小角半、高貨亦小近角、全市開甬米六百多包、江西機早及南京米四百元、亦由本街辦去、</p>
<h3>河米南漲北疲</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源轉稀、共到二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石）本街銷塲稍動、故疲憊市况、遂能帶緊、雖結果各厚破價猶無榮辱、薄破計包圍有大津靑島都續辦六百餘包、行情亦無軒輊、新粳亦定、百哥稻包胃亦動二百餘包、惟南色相仿、新蘆洋尖去路較爽、故價已有回起數分者、陳白元續因貨乏胃香、再挺一角有奇、但陰元則平常、</p>
<p>（滬北）到船卅六七號、市上各貨去胃、東新粳西新粳淡弱、新羊尖團尖茭白尖另銷平淡、白破粳價小近角、東新粳小二角、西新粳小二角、新羊尖團尖茭白尖價小角外、埠尖到少銷活、轉緊近角、白元簿稻定勢、百哥小二一角、新客尖平定、靑浦新窰種到數十石、米品尙佳、價開十元〇二角、其餘各貨均見軟勢、</p>
<h3>新荳芝麻到稀市昂</h3>
<p>雜糧市塲、新貨均已應市、自過秋節以來、各地年境豐歉不一、故市氣向榮自成本高貴、販運乏利、致其來源單薄、昨市中關天津新荳開四元四角四、嘉定新荳開四元三角半、九江遲荳開四元二角、牛莊新靑荳開四元二角七、江北新缸荳開四元零七分、高郵新紅糧開三元零六分、管、新芝蔴開七元、丹陽新芝蔴開六元一角半、南京新芝蔴開七元、管員新菜綠豆開五元二角、蠶荳嘉定貨已開至三元一角二分矣、</p>

<p>昨日屯溪夾路莊之珍周綠茶、法銷略形活動、同孚天裕華茶保昌等杭均起開辦、成交三百八十餘箱、市盤穩定、平水珠茶銷路暢達、昨市協和同孚等行繼續虧進五百餘箱、市面亦頗堅硬、惟紅茶銷路依然呆滯、英俄莊因印度錫蘭會價低廉、進意殊形冷淡云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　生晒肉回升一元</h3>
<p>生晒圓肉、前以石碼貨步鬆、曾降至六十元、但邇來到貨不動、銷路尙佳、因此復轉緊勢、查前日所到十餘箱、昨已如數開出、比前漲起一元、後貨如到數不多、防有再升之象、</p>
<h3>金針菜又見高峯</h3>
<p>金針菜近以銷胃活絡、而來貸身份干燥、已不虞其變壞、故市勢步緊迭見高峯、昨號方復有開出頂莊菜一批、價爲二十一元、比前盤又漲一元、其餘中次檔亦有隨緊之勢、後市似難轉鬆也、</p>

<h3>糖果救災</h3>
<p>— 創芬</p>
<p>小朋友：今年的水災，不用我說，你們差本多都知道了；災區裏的苦同胞，因爲一切東西，都被水冲去，很急切的希望我們去拯救他們阿！</p>
<p>上面的「糖果救災」四個字，就是請求你們把買「糖果」吃的錢節省下來，去救「災區」裏的苦同胞。</p>
<p>小朋友：我知道你們一定很懷疑：懷疑着你們買糖果吃的錢，是很微很微的，就是節省下來，那裏能夠救濟得災區裏很多的苦同胞呢？不！要知道「聚沙可以成塔」，「積水可以成渠」；你一個人的錢是很少的，大家積聚起來，那就積成很多的了。</p>
<p>從今天起，希望小朋友們把買糖果吃的錢．節省下來，積聚相當的數目，就可以交到信實的義賑會裏去，去救濟災區裏的苦同胞。譬如你一個人省下來的錢，能夠救濟一個災區裏苦同胞的話，那末一村一鄉一縣一省而至全國，小朋友是很多的，個個像你這樣的熱心，不是也能夠救濟很多的苦同胞嗎？</p>
<p>惻隱之心，人皆有之！我謹爲災區裏的苦同胞請命。請求小朋友們來實行這個輕而易舉的救災工作吧！</p>
<h3>兒童掌故隨談</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>孔融兒子的明見</p>
<p>孔融做官得罪給捉了去。那時他有兩個兒子，大的九歲，小的八歲，兩兒正在一起玩要，聽得了消息毫無驚慌之色。孔融求差人饒了這兩個孩子罷，回頭可囑他倆趕快逃難。他倆同聲回道：「爸爸，你幾曾見過覆巢之下還有完全的鳥卵呢？」果然，沒一會兒又有奉命捉拿二子的差人到了。</p>
<p>以小喻大，推論物理及於人情，這兩個孩子的見識和判斷力，居然勝過了一位當局者迷的賢父咧！俗話說：「英雄所見略同，」這不是一對小英雄麽？可惜在亂世要不知毀滅了多少英雄種子啊！</p>

<h3>秋</h3>
<p>— 小讀者顧忠鶴</p>
<p>寒蟬悽惻地悲鳴，</p>
<p>凉風也把蟋蟀吹醒；</p>
<p>歸去吧！燕燕，</p>
<p>大自然已換了一幕秋景。</p>
<p>天高氣爽…月白…風淸；</p>
<p>小虫兒奏起心琴。</p>
<p>在遠遠的天涯一角，</p>
<p>閃爍着幾顆小星。</p>
<p>一池波靜，</p>
<p>反映出二三枝小樹將枯的麗影；</p>
<p>黃葉一片片無生息地伏任路</p>
<p>恨見束籬一朵朶菊花抒英。</p>
<h3>有趣的小玩具</h3>
<p>— 石庵</p>
<p>小朋友！你們常常看電影，要化費許多的金錢，並且時間上也太不經濟；現在介紹一件很有趣的小玩具，又經濟而且又不化多的時間，想你們一定是很歡迎的；</p>
<p>材料：毛筆一枝墨汁一瓶舊書籍一本</p>
<p>做法：將筆染上墨汁，在每頁書的上角，畫着人像，或物件，（你愛甚麼就盡甚麽）將全書畫完以後，可算是成功了，然後再把書拿在手中，要翻得很快，（越快越好）這樣馬上就可以看得角上的人像打架，或是物件移動，如同影戲一樣，小朋友們！那不是一件很有趣的小玩意兒麽？你們如果不相信的話，不妨照上述的做法，去試一試，保你能得到很滿意的結果的。</p>
<h3>水的利害</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>現在沿着黃河，長江兩流域一帶的地方，大家都鬧着水災，住在那裏的人們，對於這個「水」字，目然祗覺得它的不好，咒詛，怨恨……着它。如果住在久旱的地方的人們，大家就要歡迎甘霖早霈，在蒙古沙漠一帶，那「水」眞要寶貝了，口渴時駱駝嘴裏吐出來的水，都要喝了，小朋友！因爲中國正鬧看水災，對於「水」的罪惡，大槪在報紙上，雜誌上都可以看到，但是對於「水」的利益，和怎樣偉大，恐怕小朋友們，不大明白吧！</p>
<p>「水」這樣東西，對於我們人生，是極有關係的。在衛生書裏吿訴他們說：「水雖是沒有營養的價値，却占人體全重量約三分之一，血液和消化液中含量最多，溶化營養案，搬運老廢物，以及調節體溫等等，都是生理上必要的作用。」還有植物若沒有水，倆現出枯黃來，而致於死地，人若得不到水，那也要像草一樣的死了。</p>
<p>「水」的性質，是生平不歡喜住在高的地方，非要淌得平坦爲限，但它出身，却在高山上，所以往往直趨而下，波濤洶湧，橫衝直撞，堤岸崩潰，釀成所謂「水災」的慘劇，從前的人，因爲知道它的力量極大，就把磨子放在河濱，立刻轉動，磨成末，又把電動機也放在河濱，使它旋，而發生電力，以興種種實業，它又能負走若干萬噸的輸船，運輸上，交通上，因此日有進步，「水」這樣看來，對於我們着實有極大的貢獻呢？現在我們罵「水」的不好，眞不應該的啊！</p>
<h3>結繩的故事</h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>在世界沒有文字以前，人類是用什麼東西助記憶的？繩兒那時已經有了，於是他們就利用它，雖然繩兒的主要用途是縛東西或捕禽獸的。有了一椿事情，惟恐忘記，就在繩上打個結兒：這和我們現在記在日記薄上沒有什麽分別。歷史學家稱這個時期爲「結繩時期」，所謂「上古結繩而治」。</p>
<p>希洛多德斯是希拉的歷史家，也是世界最古的歷史家。他約生於兩元前四百四十七年。在他所著的歷史裏，有關於結糊的故事如下：</p>
<p>「國王大留斯拿了一根皮帶，把它縛上六十個結兒後，就召集那輩目稱爲王的哀沃尼人，和他們說道：「哀沃尼的人們聽者，以前所發那道保守橋樑的命令，我要把它撤銷了。看啊，這裏有一條皮帶，你們拿了，且聽我的訓令罷。我現在要離開你們到雪西亞去了。我去之後，你們每天要解一個結兒，直至末一個結爲止。倘使我還不回來，那末你們可離開防地，浮海回你們的老家去。同時要曉得我的計劃是變更了，你們必須用全力守住那橋樑啊。你們能這樣做，就是大大的對我盡職」大留斯說畢，便飛馳而去。」</p>
<p>這是歷史上所載用結繩的方法帮助記憶的一件事實。此外像南美秘魯等處，古代也有結各色的繩兒，記那各種的事情的。</p>
<h3>故事畫</h3>
<p>— 張友鑑</p>
<p>—又射痛了—</p>
<p>（一）榮兒裝了一竹籮的東西來，要在郊外野餐；可是肥兒還沒有準時到來。</p>
<p>（二）榮兒就獨自一人把竹籮裏的東西搬到地上的一塊白布上；然後開了一大瓶的汽水。他想：「一定要先搖了幾搖，瓶裏的汽就格外的足了。』</p>
<p>（三）「蓬」的一聲，那瓶塞像箭一般的射出去，恰巧射在躱在樹後的肥兒的臉上。</p>
<p>（四）肥兒哭着說：「上次被你彈痛了，這次又被你射痛。」榮兒笑着說：「誰呌你偷懶，不來相帮我，卻躱在這裏偷看？』</p>
<h3>介紹兒童讀書會</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今年是兒童年，與凡一切兒童的幸福，成人們是應該竭力予以顧到的，什麽兒童影院呀，什麼兒童圖書館呀，什麽兒童體育塲呀，這許多，我們很希望各地從速成立，使一般的兒童，得到普遍的幸福。</p>
<p>閔行民衆敎育館圖書部，鑒於一般的兒童，沒有課餘讀書的機會，於是便組織了一個兒童課餘讀書會，凡在學校讀書的兒童，都有參加的權利，（幼稚生一二年的學生除外）該館一方而選購了不少的兒童圖書，以供兒童的借閱，同時，再印就了測騐的卡紙，每月舉行閱讀測騐一次，成績佳者，還給以相當的奬品，所以，一般的兒童，都很高興的去參加這個調查會，現在加入的兒童數，已經有了七八十人呢。</p>
<p>我認爲在兒童年之中，這個組織是很需要的，希望各地的民衆敎育機關，也繼起組織，使各地的兒童，都有一個課餘閱讀的機會，得到精神食糧的供給，這是一件很有迫切需要的事，大家不要認爲兒童是不配有什麽組織的呵。</p>
<h3>圖畫故事</h3>
<p>— （秦倩佩作）</p>
<p>（一）小狗對馬說：你出來給我騎一趟，等一會給又肥又嫩的靑草你吃；</p>
<p>（二）馬等了他，小狗很得意的把他牽出馬棚；</p>
<p>（三）他不願做小狗的奴隸，而蹤身一跳，把小狗彈得很遠。</p>
<h3>一個智勇雙全的童子</h3>
<p>— 飾</p>
<p>在寒冬臘月天氣陰霺的一個淸晨，一條荒靜小徑上走着兩個大漢，一個年紀約莫三十多歲，濃眉暴眼，滿臉橫肉，一個年紀老些，滿腮鬍子，臉上有一倏深刻的刀疤，一望便知都不是善類。那時迎面緩緩地走來一個村童，臂上挽着一隻柴籃，口裏唱着山歌。</p>
<p>「喂！你瞧！買費來了，」那年老的對年輕的說。</p>
<p>「這眞是天無絕人之路，好多天沒有買賣，呌人急够了」，年輕的回答說。</p>
<p>兩人正談着，童子已到了面前。</p>
<p>「小孩！慢走！跟咱們一塊去，你若違抝，馬上便結果了你的小狗命」年輕的話未說完，那年老的已打腰裏拔出害亮的大刀，對着童子的臉晃了兩晃。</p>
<p>童子大吃驚，要喊救命呢，荒野地方，沒人來救，恐怕眼前便命丟命。罷，罷，罷，還是跟着他們走，再等機會吧，童子這樣想着。</p>
<p>「我跟着兩位爺爺走便了，」童子顫聲說着，便跟兩個惡漢上路。</p>
<p>「王二！天好冷啊！這兒離市梢不遠，去買點酒來暖暖肚兒，好麼，我在這破廟裏等你，」那年老的說。</p>
<p>「好！好！我也正想喝兩杯哩。」說着，便向右面一條小路走去，走了十幾步，又回頭大喊道：「別讓小鬼逃走。」</p>
<p>「放心！放心！」那年老的拍着胸膛回答。一面便帶童子走進破廟，把大刀拔出，用力向地上一挿，便雪亮亮地直堅着，於是把童子的雙手反綁着，又撕了一塊破布，塞在嘴裏，便躺在地上靜等王二回來。</p>
<p>童子那裏敢動，不一會，那老漢鼾聲大作，已睡着了。童子暗想，這時不下手，還等何時？便悄悄地把背後手腕上縛的繩緊貼着刀鋒，上下拉了幾下，那繩便寸寸地斷去。兩手雖已恢復自由，却已鮮血淋淋。於是急忙迥轉身來，用力把那大刀拔起，對準老漢頸脖，猛砍下去。只聽得「啊呀」一聲，刀落處，鮮血直噴，接速又砍了兩刀，那老漢在地上滾了幾滾，便直挺挺地睡住不動了。</p>
<p>童子見目的已達，正想逃走，不料那去買酒的王二已提了酒壺踏進廟門。王二知道童子已把他的同夥趙大殺死，大呌道：「好大膽的東西！」怒睜變目，拿起刀來。對着童子頭頗砍去。</p>
<p>「爺爺，饒了我吧！」童子眼快，閃在一邊，跪在地上喊着求饒。「你把我殺了，也是白殺了的，你們原打算賣掉我，那老漢不死，賣的錢是要兩人對分的，現在你可一人獨得了，你還是留着我命，把我賣掉的好，老漢待我兇惡，我才殺他，你若是好好待我，我自然聽你的活，」那童子又苦苦哀求着說。</p>
<p>王二想了想，這話倒也有理，便在地上握了一坑，把趙大屍首埋好，又把買來的酒喝完，藏起大刀，帶着童子繼續上路</p>
<p>走到黃昏時候，找了一家客店安歇。臨睡之前，王二知道童子的厲害，便對童子說道：「我王二不比趙大那般糊塗，會喪命在小鬼手裏。」說着，使把童子兩手兩脚牢牢縛住，使他絲毫動彈不得。</p>
<p>童子倒在床邊的地上，怎能合眼，暗想到此地步，挿翅難飛。正在着急的時候，忽然計上心頭；便悄悄地滾到火盆旁邊，把兩腕縛緊的繩擱在盆裏燒紅了的炭上，不一會，繩子果然斷了，但手上的皮膚也焦爛了。童子咬緊牙關，忍着疼痛，順手取得大刀，把脚上的割斷，這時心花怒放，便急忙站起身來，又照殺趙大的法兒，把床上睡的王二結果了性命。</p>
<p>童子見仇人已死，又驚又喜，便開了房門，大喊道：「快來瞧啊！我把一個兇徒殺死。。」客店中的人都從睡夢中驚醒，披了衣服來看，只見一個人倒在床上，鮮血還在滴着，於是童子便把兩備惡漢在路上如何刦他，他如何先後把他們殺死的情形，一五一十，吿訴大衆。衆人聽了，都讚道：「好一個有胆有識的孩子！」店主人等到天明，便帶了童子前去稟報縣官，縣官又稟報州官，州官傳見童子，問明實情，也大大稱讀道：「你眞是一個智勇雙全的好孩子！一本想留他在衙門裏當個小職使，因爲童子不願，便買了兩套衣服和鞋帽，派人送他回家。</p>
<p>這件事出在唐朝梆州地方，童子姓區名寄，年才十一歲。大文學家柳宗元曾替他做了一篇傳記，題目是「童區寄傳。」</p>
<h3>白山烏的故事（三）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我父親在懊惱之中，一連丟了我好幾天，不做理會。他老人家雖很暴躁，但是他也有一顆仁慈的心，我瞧他常常在對我偷看着，分明很願意饒恕我而喚我回去；我的母親更滿眼含着愛子之情，時時刻刻的抬頭瞧着我，有時放出一絲悲哀的聲音，在低低的喚着我；但我那身可怕的白羽，使他們觸目生氣，我早就瞧釗，再也沒法兒補救的了。</p>
<p>我不住的對自己說道：「我不是頭山烏！我决不是一頭山烏！」這是實在的，每天早上，我理着毛羽，在水落的積水中照着我的影兒，我很淸楚的瞧到自己，確是一些兒不像我家裏的人。我又喃喃地說道：「呀！天哪！請你吿知我，我到底是什麼啊！」</p>
<p>一天晚上，雨下得很急，我又餓又惱，快要睡過去了。忽地看見我的旁邊，飛來了一頭烏，身上比我更浸得濕，顏色更顯得白，肌膚更見得瘦。我從雨中瞧過去，他的身材比我大，毛色也和我相像，可是稀少得很，連一頭麻雀的身子也遮蓋不了。我瞧他是一頭很窮苦的烏；但他雖在風吹雨打之中，仍然保持着一種高傲的態度，這就引起我的好感來了。我很謙下的向他行了一個敬禮，他把他的嘴啄了我一下，直把我從水落上瞧了下去。他見我掙扎着起來，便嘶聲地問道：「你是誰？」</p>
<p>我怕他第二次再摔我下去，戰戰兢兢地說着：「唉！大先生，我也莫明其妙。我自以爲是一頭山烏，但他們却說我並不是山烏。』</p>
<p>我這奇怪答話和誠實的態度，倒引起了他的興味。他來到我的身旁，要我訴說我的故事，我不敢怠慢，把一切經過情形，悽悽惻惻地說了出來。</p>

<h3>自救自贖與賑災</h3>
<p>— 瓊玖</p>
<p>在全國洪水泛濫，遍地成災的當兒，　家倫夫人張維楨女士，發表了題為「自救與自贖」的演說。苦口婆心，奉勸國人慷慨解囊，尤其特別指出婦女助賑的具體方案，這是值得我們注意的。張女士的演詞雖長，但大約略地分析起來，不外以下三層：</p>
<p>一，災民生活的苦況：「今年泛濫成災的區域，多到十六省，災民人數，多到二千五百萬…………這些受苦難的同胞，平時生活已經夠苦，現在遭這種空前的洗劫，他們的骨肉死了，連屍體都不能一見，自己挨餓挨凍，還得忍心看　年的老親和弱小的孩兒活受罪。這些災民過的，真是人間的地獄生活」，以「生活優裕」的張女士，而能這樣關心災民生活，為災民呼籲，是值得感佩的。</p>
<p>二，當裕階級應自救與自贖，對於這一點，張女士說得更沉痛而警惕。她說：「我們要知道巡些受苦難的同胞，都是被剝削的勞苦民眾，我們在都市之中所享的豐衣足食，和榮華富貴，都是他們平時一點一滴的汗血所積成的。…………我深深的感覺，我們過優裕生活的人，為受災的同胞出一些錢，出一些力，也無非是替自己贖罪。…………中國農村同胞的悲慘生活，正是都會富裕階級的罪孽。現在他們躲在樹稍上，浮在水面上，求我們一點充饑的粗糧，和一些禦寒的舊衣，以維持父母辛苦養大的生命，我們豐衣足食的人，此時還不替自己贖罪還待什麼時候？…………私人的動產和不動產，都是靠不住的，與其日後不明不白的喪失，不如今日慷慨的捐出一部分，以救同胞的生命。」在一般富裕階級中人，誰也不會願意說出，他們的富裕原來剝削自勞苦民眾的，然而張女士竟坦然地大胆地說了。我們希望每個「豐衣足食和榮華富貴」的人，都能有這樣的自覺。實際地起來自贖！</p>
<p>第三，關於募捐的方案：張女士提出了兩個具體的辦法，她說：「第一，要普遍，我們要使全國大多數的人民，各盡自己的力量，有錢的捐錢，有東西的捐東西，…………就是每人捐幾個銅子，也能夠得到集腋成裘的功效。」</p>
<p>不錯！「集腋可以成裘，」不過張女士前面已經說：「今年的災區，已到十六省之多，」何況其餘未災區的大多數民眾，也和災民不相上下，即能「成裘」，恐怕杯永車薪，無濟於事！幸喜張女士另有第二個方案：「第二我們要奉勸有力量的人的慷慨解囊…………」有力量的人能否快快的慷慨解囊，全視乎他們和她們的自贖了。然而張女士對於中上階級的婦女，只是提出了如下的一個辦法。「中上階級的婦女，大半都是消貴者，我們舒服的生活和奢侈的享受，乃是過牛馬生活的農村姊妹們終年辛苦勤菸的代價。現在她們連牛馬生活都不能維持了，我們難道不肯作小小的犧牲？我們可以把日常的生活費打個折扣，或是把娛樂酬應的欵項，分些出來，做母親的，還可以替子女提出一些糕餅錢，作為救濟災區小孩子的用途。」</p>
<p>只要過奢侈生活的中上階級婦女，作「小犧牲」是不夠的，雖然她們生活豪奢，只一筆娛樂費，兒童的一些糕餅錢，可救濟許多災民。這絕不能夠得上說自贖。真正要自贖，還是自動地來個累進的殷富捐吧！這樣也許在暫能救災民以一時之急，然而這也是不會成事實的空想！何況災情是連綿不斷地產生？豐衣足食者不將要一自贖而再自贖？所以根本的，還是來消減那種罪惡，而使那種罪惡永不發生。</p>
<h3>何處是她的出路？</h3>
<p>— 鐵懷</p>
<p>——事岀杭州，案關誘姦——</p>
<p>甲男與乙女，是師生，年齡相差在十歲以上，他倆卻暗暗地發生了關係。甲是新聞界中人，因為筆下能文，交遊又廣，故兼做了某中學的教師，而且教的是女舉生，他因此結識許多情竇初開的青年女子；又因為他上課時善扯談，喜詼諧，頗得若干妙齡女郎的好感。乙女是他的「得意門生」（？），常上他的家裏去。甲的家裏，早已有了一位如花美眷——丙女，但大家只稱她做丙小姐，不稱她為甲師母，雖然她已替甲做過了生殖機器，養過了孩子，但他倆到底沒拜過天地，沒請過親友，不能公開地儼稱夫婦。有人說：甲取這種態度，正是他誘惑其他女子最好的策略。乙女就是這種策略下的犧牲者。乙女是個早喪父母，又無兄弟的孤伶女子，她讀書全仗由她小叔父那裏用法律爭回來的少數遺產。據說用法律來爭取的這種有傷家族情感的手段，是甲幫助她咬使她的。她雖然有了錢，卻失了家庭的憑依。她這筆遺產，原可勉強培植她自己到高中舉業，可是讀不到半年，卻生了極嚴重的病，她　甲送她入病院，病後就在甲的家裏調養。調養好了，一時不能入學，就由甲替她介紹一個所入雖微卻勉強還可糊口的職業。遺祿一個舉目無親而又是病苦顛連的人，遇著了這樣一位救苦救難的甲先生，在情賣初開的弱女子心裏，自然是恩同再造，感激涕零。她便因此出賣了她的肉體，她而且不久就有了孩子。「我與丙女，橫豎是暫時同居，毫無形式，只要稍稍化幾個錢，就可以與她分離，那時候，我倆，便可以正式成為夫婦。」甲男與乙女，是這樣成了交易的</p>
<p>當乙女大腹便便，而同時又發現了甲與丁女發生關係，被T女的母親知道了，跑去糾擾，硬要嫁她的另一件戀愛事件的時候，乙一　　絕，痛不欲生。甲又花言巧語地說：「　件事情，我相信只　在你面前，可以獲得諒解。等丁女的事件解決了以後，我自然可以同你公開。現在若是公開了，反而對你不利。望你再忍耐一些時。孩子出世了以後，最好能寄養給人家，那末你依然可繼續任事。」乙女既回不得家，又不能再住到甲家裏，便只好平心靜氣的住在某旅館裏等待小生命的降臨。</p>
<p>乙女蟄居旅邸，靜待丁女事件之解抉，好使腹中的孩子，有個名正言順的父親。而甲男忽以出走開，這就是甲男「一了百了」賢明的解決辦法。這一打擊，真使她哭喊無鬥，後來是由甲的非正式夫人——丙女，做好做歹地送她進醫院的。自從把乙送進了普通病房，付出了七塊多錢欵子以後，便也一去無消息。</p>
<p>她秘密地生下了孩子，秘密地出了醫院，又秘密地把孩子寄養給了人家。錢，她的遺產，早已在生病時，寓居旅邸時用光了；出院費，還是她自己拖了個產後的病體，到她朋友家裏去借了來付的。出了醫院，她又無處容身，暫時寄居在朋友家。朋友中有知道這件事的，憤慨異常，勸她法律起訴，她起初因為無錢請律師，還是疑惑不決。剛巧有一位律師自願替她盡力：官司如果輸了，她願實自認晦氣；官司如果贏了，得了罰欵以後，照規矩三七拆帳。她於是便把她的受騙經過，訴之於法律。這時候，甲早已逃之夭夭，無法使之到案。丙女還留在他的家裏，除甲以外，丙也是被告之一，告她幫同略誘，也當到庭受審。當第一次傳而未審的時候，有人出來調停：甲方願意出價一千二百元，連丁女也解決在內，由乙女丁女及乙的孩子平分，買絕了三人的糾紛。乙女在這時候，滿望法律能夠幫助她？她可以勝訴，她可以出一口被騙被遺棄的怨氣，自然不接受這和解條件。誰知第一庭偵查的結果，檢察官給她一個「不起訴處分」。她去請教律師，律師勸她上訴，但第二次審判結果，又是個不起訴處分，理由是她沒有監護人。沒有監護人就合該任人蹂躪嗎？法律書上難道詩：法律不保護弱女子？</p>
<p>再上訴嗎。她已沒有了勇氣。以不了了之嗎。又覺太不甘心，請監護人出來再上訴嗎？她為了要顧全她的名譽，對家裏還把隱痛瞞住著；而且她的監護人————　又，為了分家，已成了她的冤家，不會幫　她。她　直無路可走！她想自殺，她憑死到甲的　邊去，甲遠在異國，逍遙法外。她想護書，她已沒有了錢。她想找職業，她不過是個初中畢業生，又沒有可走的門路。她想嫁人，甲曾經幫助她繼絕了她家裏替她代定的婚姻。而且，在目今的社會裏，如果是個男子，愛過人，與人發生過開係，生過孩子，那到不要緊，社會會給他諒解，他依然可以娶妻，依然可以過他幸福的新婚生活；而乙是個女子，是個復古空氣十分濃厚的現中國社會中的女子，是個生過孩子被人遺棄的女于，會有人肯娶她嗎？</p>
<p>何處是她的出路？我願女同胞及注意婦女問題的先生們，肯化費一點時間與心思為她一想嗎？自然；說整個社會言，這不過是畸形壯會中的某一種畸形現象。但間題之關於社會者，空間時間，本　很多，正有待於我們的分析，認識。</p>
<p>事實是千真萬確的，為了乙女太看重名譽，太看重了舊禮教桎梏下的名譽，暫不把真姓名宣佈。　並不是為了甲先生有相當地位，畏而不言。好在目的只在說明事態，並非意在攻忤，用代名詞說明，也無多大關係吧？</p>

<h3>回家（續）</h3>
<p>— 蘇虹</p>
<p>小尼子過來，邀修珍同道去看。修珍似乎並不怕，她穿上棉衣，兩人躡手躡腳的一起躲在草堆後面。</p>
<p>稀少的星在天上閃，清寒的水在河中凝凍，冷風刺著耳朵。小尼子抱著修珍，眼睛刮溜溜的向前望。</p>
<p>黑黝黝的一大　人，在那整齊的屋宇四週，團團地圍立著。他們每個人拿著火炬，又有的傘著鐵笆，利斧，有的盒著鋤頭鐮子，有的人扛了塊大石頭撞那扇烏黑的犬門，「澎呀，澎呀，」地響。小尼子鼻涕拖出二三寸長，抱緊修珍，她的嘴巴一歪一歪地動，似做在幫著那批人用勁。</p>
<p>——開，不開，要用火燒…！」那　人高喊著。</p>
<p>門依舊是緊閉，石頭依舊繼續撞，火炬已燒了半支。</p>
<p>——開！不開，就要用火燒！」</p>
<p>風更緊。嚴霜酒著，火光照出河中的冰。</p>
<p>——定會撞進的。「修珍輕輕地說。</p>
<p>——小尼子猛搖手，又悶上修珍的嘴。</p>
<p>大門已經有些寬鬆，漸漸破碎了門板，又加上幾把斧口的猛斬。</p>
<p>那羣人正在用勁，在橋的那一邊，卻鑼聲四起，又洋槍聲「　」「　」地響。他們回頭一瞧，立即忙亂起來，大家熄滅著火炬，有的用腳踏熄，有的拋到河裏，有的來不反處理，竟帶著火炬亂逃。剎時鳥台鬥的面前黑暗下來，又同時冷落，只聽見腳聲「殺殺」地響。他們是向修珍住的屋宇這邊逃的，頓時又似乎向山　下隱了去。</p>
<p>保團團趕來，一見巳經無人，依舊放著空槍示威，又圍著山麓守候。</p>
<p>小尼子嚇得發抖，兩人緊拉著手逃進屋來。</p>
<p>——哽喲！去看什麼哩，又是這樣冷。」母親一邊給女兒掃去頭上的草殼。一邊連遞過「老虎頭」給她取暖。</p>
<p>槍聲也靜寂下去，似乎一場哄鬧已經過去，不問忠貴少爺家裏究竟怎麼樣。一般受驚嚇的鄰戶都安排重入夢鄉，嫂嫂也進了房門。母親雖然也脫下了衣鞋，進了被窩。但總是轉轉側側地睡不著。她很不安的樣子。仰起頭望望修珍，又　一整被頭，又摸摸床頭的茶壺，重臥倒，剛剛矇矇隴隴，又聽得「澎」的一聲響動，她驚醒過來，立即起床，開鬥出去，屋內外並無什麼變動。</p>
<p>——媽！什麼？」修珍問。</p>
<p>——沒有什麼，我去看看門關好沒有。」</p>
<p>——不是我看你親自關的碼？」嫂嫂在問璧插嘴。</p>
<p>——我好像聽你有「澎」的一聲哩！」母親坐下床頭默默地念了一陣佛，摸摸索索地似乎想入睡，忽然抽動幾下鼻子，鶴起頭，側著耳，鼻子又抽動幾個，她去被裏的「老虎頭。</p>
<p>——火爐有沒有倒掉，大嫂？」</p>
<p>——沒有，到現在已經　啦。」</p>
<p>——怎麼有火焦氣　？」</p>
<p>——那是因為剛才放了洋槍，……火藥氣。」</p>
<p>——火　氣？一　　，　　疑的，爪入被窩。</p>
<p>風更緊，在窗外捕　。屋脊格格地響，倒掛　　著秋千，灰沙如篩米一樣洒。</p>
<p>婦女問題講座</p>
<h3>第三節　教育問題</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>這裏所謂教育間題，乃是婦女在教育上要獲得與男子平等地位的問題。這間題的主要內容就是要求對女子開放中等以上的學校，要求給與女子和男子同等的學位，要求撤廢一切性的差別教育等等。這和參政問題同樣，成為婦女問題的重心，同時成為十九世紀初頭以來的一般女權主義運動的基本綱領。</p>
<p>教育原是人類生活的一種方法。人類除有本能的生活外還有智能的生估。而所謂智能乃是由經驗得來的東西。人類有了這種智能才能和動物分家，才能創造人類社會的文化。人類為著保存和創造這社會的文化價值，就用教育的方法相互傳授經驗的智能。因此就廣義言之，自有大類便有教育，又偕杜威的話來說，「生活即是教育」，詳言之，教育就是人類要適應自然環境和推進社會生活的一種方式，這裏無所謂男女之分和貴賤之別，大凡有益於人類生活的知識與技能，都必須相與闡明和傳授！</p>
<p>我們知道，在原始與共同體社會，教育的目的是和社會的目的一致的。在那裏號無階層的差別教育，也沒有性的差別教育。共同體的生活儀式及生產勞動是和教育密切的結合著，可是自從社會發生了階級和男權以後，就有了教育上的男女之分和貴賤之別，詳言之貴者是受指揮賤者的教育，賤者是要受被貴者指揮的教育，同樣的男子是受支配女子的教育，女子是要受被男子支配的教育。希臘羅馬時代的貴族及官由民是貴者，奴隸是賤者，封建時代的領圭及僧侶是貴者，農奴是賤者，資本主義時代的有產者是貴者，無產者是賤者，同時以上各時代的男子是支配者，女子是被支配者，在他們間的教育有明確的區別，決不可混同，在中國封建時代，「民可使由之，不可使知之」是對農奴的教育政策，「三從四德」及「女子無才便是德」是對婦女的教育原則。這樣，原始共同體崩壞以來的教育是不單跟生產勞動分家，同時有階層之別和男女之分。婦女教育問題的歷史的社會的根源就在此點。</p>
<p>可是，到了資本主義勃興時期，市民層是意識地提出了這問題，十八世紀法國的教育學者斐乃倫（Eenelon）及孔達爾塞（Condorcet）是熱心的擁護女子教育，到法國大革命以後，女子教育的問題已經成了主要社會問題，特別英國的華爾斯登格拉夫脫女士在其所著「女構擁護論」中具體的提出這個問題，從此以後這問題便成了女權運動的中心問題。</p>
<p>在封建時代，女子在　度的壓迫之下，其教育根本不能成為什麼問題，就是說，除了極少教的貴族婦女在　房或僧尼中修得賢母良妻主義的家事知識外，大多數婦女都完全處於文　狀態，但到這個時期，新興的市民　同國民義務教育的問題一塊提出了女子學校教育的問頸。這決不是偶然的，聰明的市民　為了建設資本主義的社會，就需要國民教育的普及，同時需要女子的現代化教育。</p>
<p>資本主義的生產方法是不　把生產組織身體社會化，同時把全全人們的生活社會化！引入於資本主義的生產關係的社會成員，無論是男子或女子都必須有普通的國民知識，這樣才能提高社會的生產力，才能增進市民層的利潤率。這就是最初提出女子普通教育問題的主要原因。其次受了高度的現代化教育的市民層的男子們是需要能夠「讀寫算數」的現代化婦女，來配合他們的生活，而且需要有著科學的教養的婦女，來養育他們的子女。另一方面市民層的婦女自身也在家族制度日見破產的時代中自覺到丈夫和家庭的不可靠，就需要獲得用以保障其生活的新知識，由於這兩方面的需要，就提出了男女在教育上平等的問題</p>
<p>女權主義者們所提出的女子教育問題，自從十九世紀中葉巳經得到部分的解決。一八六七年對女子最初開放大學，的是瑞士，其次是英美，從此以後各國次第實行開放，直到大戰前後女子教育問題似乎完全被解決了，不論在那　國，祇要你有錢便可以進大學，修得同男子一樣的知識，更可以得到學士或博士等頭銜！於是，女權運勁者們帶著勝利的微笑說：「教育問題被解次了」！但是我們卻可以這樣同答：「市民層的女權主義者自身的教育問題也許是被解決，但大多數婦女的教育問題並沒有得到解決呵！」</p>
<p>當然，高等學校的門是開放著，但　有錢的婦女才得進去；但是沒有錢的婦女太多了！問題仍然沒有解決！現在，女權主義者們再不願意去　決道個問題，因為現在並非單純的教育問題，而是有錢讀書和沒有錢讀書的問題。這當然是他們所不願提起的問題。不過，這問題不解決，所謂女子教育問題不能得到根本的解決。</p>

<h3>德意志當前的四大鐵鏈</h3>
<p>— 盈</p>
<p>陷戰後的德國於內憂外患，使德國政治捲入極度擾懷的漩渦，使全國人心極度惶恐不安的，無非是凡爾賽條約一手所造成。</p>
<p>擁有廣大領土的英美，在這整個世界不景氣中尙且惴惴不安，何況本土被割，殖民地被奪，又負荷莫大的賠款重擔的德意志，自然是要陷入於深刻的苦悶中了。</p>
<p>凡爾賽條約所給予德國的損失，除德國全殖民地面積百二十萬方哩和人咪四百六十萬人外，即本土亦失去十分之一的領土與人口。而被奪去的土地在產業上軍路上均極重要，我們只要看失地中內含鐵產地十分之八，炭田十分之二，五一，就可明瞭一切。條約中又規定德國常備軍人數以十萬為限，更禁止飛機，坦克，毒瓦斯，重砲等科學武器，事實上僅僅允許德國有二等國以上的兵備，並且大戰中死傷六百萬人，戰費犧牲千五百億馬克的德國，還要依道斯案楊格案被支配償付幾百億馬克的賠款，這不能不說是人類有史以來唯一的民族大悲劇。</p>
<p>現在，德意志仍然被束縛於四大鐵鏈之中，卽一，賠款問題，二，國境問題，三，殖民地問題，四，軍備問題。</p>
<p>（一）賠款問題　協約國方面對於德意志所罰的鉅大賠款，不用說那是早已違反了威爾遜提出的十四條約的「無併合」「無賠償」的原則。在　和會議時，其賠款額，協約國方面欲訂為二千二百六十億馬克，至一九二一年斯巴會議後才減為一千三百億馬克。這是規定在三十年間須完納的數目。不用說，這種負擔絕對不是德國經濟能力所能容許的。戰後的德意志本已感到極度疲憊，更加上被要求支給現金及實物，遂使德國經濟愈益惡化，馬克紙幣價格狂跌不已。後法國企圖制裁德國，於一九二三年一月佔領魯兩區域，魯南佔　的結果不僅使德國益陷於貧窮，即法國亦無所得，因是協約國方面又先後成立道斯案及楊格寧，將賠款減至三百五十八億金馬克，賠償期又延長至五十八年。一九二九年秋，美國經濟恐慌的餘波影響於德國時，美前總統胡佛氏才提議協約國對美戰債及德國賠款延期支付。但世界整個的經濟恐慌繼續未已，使德國支付賠款成為不可能，英法意諸國遂認一九三二年開洛桑會議，於此會議，德國賠款又減少三十億馬克，較之斯巴會議的一千三百二十億金馬克的要求，實不能不說是具　滑稽性的減縮。由此可知凡爾賽系統諸國對德不合理要求是如何嚴肅而可怕的了。</p>
<p>但悍強而又困疲的德意志，是否即以此為最後掙扎呢？不，德國仍然為賠償問題煩懵著。他要絕對解除這一條鎖鏈。</p>
<p>（二）國境問題　如前所述，德國戰役的結果，約有本土十分之一為法，比，波蘭，捷克所奪取，這些日耳曼人被治於其他國家之內，這是使德意志人大為不平。但德國在當初也頗自了解其為戰敗國，自不得不忍氣吞聲接受當然的懲罰，並且更不欲再招萊茵流域的被佔領，乃於一九二五年十二月圖印於諾加爾條約。這樣，圖於西部國境的問題總算解決了，於是德意志關於國境問題的不平，便完全集中於所謂「波蘭迦廊」問題。現在德國要求改訂凡爾賽條約，訂正國境的主要目的卽在此迦廊問題，誠然，德國也要奪還被割於立陶宛的米爾美地方，也要恢復被奪於捷克斯拉夫的嘻勒齊思上部，且亦具重大決心，但比之蘭迦廊問題熱炙於心則猶有遜色。所以有人觀察下次歐羅巴的禍亂於波，將即以此迦廊問題為原因的德波爭端為肇始。</p>
<p>自所謂波蘭迦廊為波蘭以欲得海口為理由被割讓以後，繫於德意志本土與東布羅依善兩者之間的火車，常受波蘭各種惡意的干涉。迦廊的德人及德系文化多被壓迫，但澤又作為自由港，歸入波蘭的關稅區域。因此，德國不得不繼續不斷的作改訂國境的抗爭。意大利首相墨索里尼遺為聲援，英國亦投以同情的眼波；法國所唱的凡爾賽條約的神聖論，麥唐納曾謂「一切條約皆神聖的，但任何條約均非永久的」，言外之音足為對德共鳴的鐵證。可是法國始終以支持波蘭為　　德意志對此第二鐵鏈總認為是寢食不安的莫大痛苦。</p>
<p>（三）軍備問題，德國在國際聯盟的軍縮會議中，竭力呼籲與法軍備平等，結果，法國僅許以「獲得安全保障」為承認「軍備平等」的條件；這種德意志所受的不平種子是在使德意志趨向狂吼的原因。</p>
<p>（四）殖民地回復問題　關於這備戰個鐵鏈的熱心衝擊，也是使德意志人無時或忘的事，在　倫敦世界經濟會議時，德國全權代表農商部長胡根堡氏曾力陳回復殖民地之戰，且竟因此提出辭呈。</p>
<p>在目前，凡爾賽系統德國對德國努力衝破凡爾賽鐵鏈的行動，仍處處採取壓迫的態度，但悍強如德國，當然也是不甘屈服的。</p>
<p>德意志是在復活了，可是德意志依然是歐洲低氣壓的中心。德意志的危機再蹈也將是世界人類的最大不幸。</p>
<p>業餘修學</p>
<h3>我怎樣學習「拉丁花」</h3>
<p>— 符仲帆</p>
<p>江南人，特別是僵掉舌根的無錫人，要學北方話是頂困難的；除非有一個很長的時期住到北方去，否則總是「江北驢子學馬叫」，不容易學得像。但是，中國話拉丁化卻幫助了這個問題的解決。</p>
<p>我因為家境的困難，去年在小學畢業後，父親託一個親戚介紹我到一家玻璃五金店裏去當學徒，自然我只有答應。當時我那親戚對我說：「那是一個北平人開的店，賬房先生也是北平，大部分做的北平，天津，煙台，青島一帶的生意：你要懂得北方話才好！」那時我的答覆是：「馬馬虎虎，不要緊，我在五年級就學過一點國語，我懂得北方話，我也會說北方話。」</p>
<p>但是，進了店，真要命，老板和賬房說的話，一句　倒有九句聽不懂，特別是老板娘的話更不懂，並且她的脾氣又是壞得可以，一碰就是「嘩啦嘩啦」；同時我說的話，他們也不能全部聽懂，因為我只會說「死勿像」的無錫國語呀　因此我吃到了不少的苦處。我氣透了！</p>
<p>後來，一個朋友給我一本天馬書店出版的「拉丁概論」的書，同時他把如何應秀，如何便利的話告訴我，我馬上就學起來，把北方話方案仔細讀完。</p>
<p>果然，二十八個字母，費了三個早晨就完全記住了，於是開始練習拼音。因為拉丁化採用了詞兒的連寫和音段的活用，只能注漢字的讀音，而且不寧　用四聲那麼困難，所以沒有兩個禮拜我就學會了拼寫。此後，再用拉丁化和漢字對照的讀物，天天偷空練習，一面我又向我的朋友要　　完全拉本化的報紙和書籍來讀，並且把老板他們說的話也試用拉丁化拼起來，努力練習。不到兩個月吧，果然老板們說的話十句有九句懂得了，我說的話他們也能懂得了；就是從北來「進貨色」的客人，我也能和他們談話了。</p>
<p>我想，拉丁化的主要目標雖然是掃除文盲，但是對於各地方言的互相學習上也有極大的幫助的。將來各地拉丁化完成以後，無錫人學廣東話，福建人學上海話，會變得很容易的了。</p>

<h3>歷史的因果性</h3>
<p>— 傅寶義</p>
<p>「我們只知道一種科學，一種歷史的科學。」——（「德國的哲學」）</p>
<p>國內某著名歷史學者曾說在歷史里面求因果是「無根之談」，但同時他也並不否認歷史學也是一種科學。這樣的見解，顯然是很矛盾的。因為一種科學的成立，必須要有具體的客觀存在的事物為其研究對象，而且這事物必然是在一定的困果法則支配之下發展變化的，歷史既是種科學，當然也就有其因果性了。不然的話，那歷史上的一切事變，歷史的變化和發展，便都是沒有原因的偶然現象，因而人類除了死板地記載歷史的事實外，也就不能用科學方法去說明歷史，去說明一切史實之所以然了。</p>
<p>歷史是人類過去生活的記載，而人類則　生活在社會中的，所以歷史不能與社會分開來談，所以歷史學和經濟學政論導一樣，是社會　　　中一種。假使把歷史與社會分開，那所謂歷史便要成為了空的東西，在科學領域中也就沒有了牠的地位。</p>
<p>事實上，不僅歷史上的評多大的變革，是在一定的社會原因下必然發生的，而且就是在大的變革中的小的事變，和事變中的一些重要人物，亦是在社會進化的必然的因果關係下出現的。大者如近代資本主義的產生，乃是封建社會由發展到崩潰的結果，乃是在封建社會衰老過程　　業發展的結　小者如　　　的　　的某幾次的勝利，和在這革命過程中的某些人物的成功，都是有其一定的社會原因的。不然的話，那何以歐洲產業的發展是發生文藝復興，宗教改革，啟蒙運動乃至市民的大革命而不發生別的呢？何以法國革命中產生了拿破崙那樣的人物而卻沒有產生像華盛頓一樣的人呢？假使人要否認歷史變化發展的必然的因果關係，那這些史實便就無法說明了。</p>
<p>否認歷史變化發展之社會的因果關係者，多半是誇大歷史上個人的作用的。在他們看來，個人在歷史上的作用非常之大，如果沒有拿破崙華盛頓那樣的人物，那法國和美國的歷史都必然要改變其內容。但依我們看來，並不是拿破崙與華盛頓創造法國和美國的歷史，倒是法國和美國的歷史產生拿破崙和華盛頓，他們都是在一定的社會原因下必然產生出來的人物。事實上，由於法國革命的爆發，國內戰爭的發展，以及接着來的普魯士和奧大利的聯軍壓迫革命，早已把法國社會秩序破壞了，在此情形下，當時法國的新興市民正需要「雄才大略」的武人安定社會，以便其着手恢復被破壞了的經濟組織，於是便產生了拿破崙；同時，在鎮壓一般夢想「自由」的法國人民上，在向外掠奪以補救國內財政空虛上，當時法國的市民也是需要拿破崙那樣的人物的。在其出征意大利時，曾上書督政部說：「吾願們此國中課得二千萬法郎，此蓋世界一最富饒之國也。」又對其部眾說：「爾腹已饑，兩體幾裸，……吾今且率爾至世上最肥沃之平原。……爾等將於彼處見偉大之都會，富庶之省分，名譽，光榮與財貨。」由此可見拿破崙是在如何迎合當時法國市民社會之需要，以努力向外設法來補救國內的財政恐慌了；同時拿破崙之蹂躪歐洲的史實，於此也可得到明確的說明。因格爾士曾說：「一個一個時代出現這樣的人物——而非別樣的人物——自然全是機會。但若將這樣的人除去，……則代替他的人終久無論如何也總是看得見的罷。科錫加的拿破崙出為軍事領袖，是機會；但他之出現在困於戰爭的法國是不可避免的；如沒有拿破崙，他的位置也總有別人佔着罷。」這就是說當時法國已具備了產生拿破崙那樣人物的社會條件（因），所以他才出為軍事領袖（果）；即使沒有他，那他的位置也必然會為他人代替（有了某種社會原因，必然會產生某種結果，絕不落空）。至於華盛頓，也是由於阿美利加殖民地資本主義勢力的發展，由於「英王政府之採用重商主義的經濟政策，壓迫美洲殖民地的產業，厲行航海條例，課輸出，品以極重的關稅」所造成的美洲革命中產生出來的，在當時情形之下，即使沒有華盛頓其人，美國獨立運動依然要爆發，獨立運動依然有人出來領導而走向成功之路。此外歷史上的一切重要人物之出現，都可以用同樣的論理去說明，無須一一加以分析。</p>
<p>此外，與誇大個人在歷史中的作用同時，否認歷史發展之必然的社會的因果關係者還特別重視歷史上的偶然事件。在他們看來，每一件史實都是單獨存在的，不是在必然的因果關係一相互連繫着的，所以他們以為一個大的歷史事變之發生，乃是由於許多偶然的機緣所促成，如果少了這些偶然的機緣，則那歷史事變之產生也就大成問題了。這樣，他們便以獨立的偶然的機緣來代替了整個的歷史的因果律。若依他們的說法，則是在赤壁之戰中如果曹操打勝了，那三個的歷史便不會產生，三國完全是由於赤壁之戰孫劉聯軍得勝這一偶然的機緣構成的；一九一國年爆發的世界大戰，也是在奧太子被刺這個偶然事件上發生的，假使沒有這個偶然事件，那歷史上也許不會有世界大戰這回事；……然而，一切偶然都只有在必然之下才有其意義。歷史是在必然的社會的因果關係支配之定發展變化的，在一個大的社會原因下必然會產生一個大的結果，在中間當然有某些形態的小的機緣發生以促使這結果實現，但如沒有某些形態的小的機緣發生，只要產生某種結果的根本的社會原因存在了，那也是要在另一些形態的小機緣上出現的。漢朝末年，由於商業資本的發展破壞了農村經濟，引起了農民的叛亂（如黃巾之亂），而各地的封建主也就乘機起來，利用農民反抗中央政府，於是中央權威削弱乃至消除，封建割據的局面便出現了。三國時代之必然在中國歷史佔一地位，其根本原因即在此。在這個根本原因之下，即使在赤壁之戰中曹軍勝利（事實上在當時的條件之下，曹軍戰敗的可能要多此）了，或者相反地曹軍一敗塗地，曹操被周郎與孔明生擒了，或者甚至說那時候沒有孫權曹操劉備諸人，那當時的政治也不能統一的，中國歷史上三國的記載也不會成為空的。至於一九一四年世界大戰之爆發，更是資本主義發展到帝國主義時期的必然的結果；即使沒有奧太子被刺的事件，大戰也會在另一偶然事件上爆發的。</p>
<p>總之，歷史的變化和發展是有一定的因果性必然性的，因此我們才能明白過去歷史的所以然，也才能依此必然的歷史的因果律，以認識現在，創造未來；否則一切便都是不可知的了。</p>

<h3>成功與失敗</h3>
<p>— 貫之</p>
<p>歡喜成功憎惡失敗，這不但是人情之常，並且也是人類的一種向上的心理表現。至於我們對於自己所景仰的事業如何才能獲得成功，避免失敗，則各人的見解就不一致了。有的人是主張全憑我們有堅決的意志的。所謂「愚公移山，有志者事竟成」，這是常常聽到的箴言。這樣說來，那麼一切的失敗也當然是我們反其道而行的結果，失敗應該歸之於意志不堅決，努力未到所種下</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>的因了。這種說法雖然可以相當地針砭一切因失敗而頹神喪志，不能堅决奮鬥到底的人，但畢竟是過於偏重主觀的說法，根本沒有明瞭事業之成功與失敗的所以然。如果用一種哲學的詞令來批評這種說法，那麽它恰恰是一種主張「客觀從屬於主觀，意識决定存在，精神可支配現實」的哲學思維，這是十分錯誤的。</p>
<p>成功興失敗固然都不能離開人的努力，不能不看當事者的毅力與才智如何，但是，我們必須知道，如果客觀世界絲毫沒有給我們準備下可以成功的機會和條件，那麽無論我們如何努力，如何具備堅决的意志和勇敢的精神，也是沒有預想的結果到來的。這就是說，在客觀的社會條件中，如果不允許我們作成某種事業，則拚命努力所得的結果一定不是成功而仍是失敗，反之，如果社會的客觀情勢已經預備下了某種事態發生的可能條件，那末，縱令由於當事者的活動犯了某些錯誤，因而使那一事業的成功不屬於他自己，甚至以此延緩了那二事業的實現，但亦終將有人來完成和他的希望相同的事業。亦卽是說這種成功是必然會到來的。總之，一種事業的成功與失敗，是社會條件决定的，特別是有關於社會的一切事業，更是如此。</p>
<p>人的努力不是完全不重要，不過人的努力只能盡到歷史的產婆的作用，必須順應和服從歷史的趨勢，向着歷史所預備的道路走去，才能成功一種事業。如果遠反了這種歷史的决定作用，則其失敗是必然的。自然在許多成功的可能條件相同的情形下，有的人是很順利地得着成功，而有的人則歸於失敗，這好像完全是由於人的條件來决定似的。其實不然。因爲所謂順利的成功，不過由於從事這種事業的人更能看淸客觀的發展條件，而毫無錯誤的順應了那些條件，一點一滴地都依照客觀的適當需要，逐步採取了完全合乎時宜的應付方略的結果而已。至於某些人之反在可能成功的條件下造成了失敗，乃是由於他們的行動方略部分的或全部的陷於謬誤，不能適應歷史的發展所造成的。這正如產婆一樣，必須要產婦懷裏有胎兒，牠才接生得下來孩子。自然，在行將臨盆的相同條件下，如果遇着有科學知識和精良技術的產婆，便可以順利地接生下來，遇着技術惡劣的產婆，也可以把產婦嬰兒弄死。但無論如何總要有胎兒才能接生下來孩子，這是一個大前提，如果母懷裏根本就沒有有胎兒，或者不到臨產的成熟期，要想接生下一個健全的嬰兒，則不管產婆好壞，都只有歸於失敗。許多人不相信這歷史的有定論，更看不淸社會發展的總趨勢，總企圖將歷史的龍頭扭轉去，使它向後轉，企圖把社會覇留住不讓它動，甚至以爲只憑一種堅决的意志和努力的結果，便能使他們的理想成功，可是這完全是一種幻想。縱令在客觀的事實，有時他們也能獲得暫時的成功，但這也只是掌握歷史動輸的車手在行動中犯了錯誤，臨時給他們造成了暫時的機會而已，並不是他們自己的理想有絕對實現和成功的可能。而且他們道種成功亦不能永久保持，歷史給他們鑄定的失敗終於會到來的。</p>
<p>因爲人們是喜歡成功而憎惡失敗的，所以在通常的俗見上，也恰如世人所饑評的那樣，以成敗論英雄。「成者爲王」，人亦以王視之，「敗者爲寇」，人亦以寇視之，這都是對於成功興失敗的一種不正當的評價。暫時成功了的事業不一定就是好的，暫時失敗了的事業也不一定就是壞的，我們應從歷史的發展的總趨勢去評價它。如果這成功是不合乎歷史演進之規律與趨勢的，那麽這成功自身就不會是能够永久保持的成功，成功背後跟着一個終結的失敗在那裏，並且這成功也是無價値的。反之，某種失敗了的事業，如果它的大體上是合乎壓史的總趨勢的理想的，那麼這失敗反是使他以後走向更正確的道路，學習歷史的敎訓的機會，因而將來的成功不但終屬於他，而且他的暫時失敗也是有價値的。這樣說來，可知不是一切成功了的事業都可以崇拜，只有能順應歷史的趨向造成的事業才値得崇拜。也不是一切失敗了的事業都可以鄙棄，如果它是合乎　　　　　的趨向的理想，縱然暫時失敗了，也仍是値得崇拜和擁護的。盲目地歐歌一切成功的事業，反對一切失敗的事業，這是錯誤的俗見，大有碍於人類的進步。</p>
<p>嚴格地說來，社會的客觀條件是變動不息的，任何形式的成功，如果是保守主義的，想在停留不前的狀態下永久保持它，則這成功就是失敗的起點。如果要想成爲永久的成功者，必須適應歷史的演變而前進，一經完成的事業必須捨得繼續加以革新，必須捨得揚棄那已經成就的固結化了的成功，爭取新的成功，因爲歷史是在進化，在改變它的相互適應的條件，卽在不斷地揚棄那種已成就的成功。只要是立於進步的前提上做成的失敗，這失敗亦是新的成功之點，函總它可以備我們獲得實憂的經騐，使我們更充分地認識怎樣適應客觀事變，促成最後成功的到來。如此說來，可知成功與失敗不是絕對對立的。假使是一種保守主義的暫時成功，則成功者可不必樂觀也值不得盲目地崇拜，因爲它轉瞬間卽會轉變爲失敗。反之，假使是一種立於進步的前提上造成的失敗，則失敗者亦不必悲觀，也用不着鄙棄，因爲它可以轉變爲最終的成功而取消這一失敗。要評判一種事業的成功與失敗的價値，要爭取成功和繼續保持那有價值的成功至於永久，要避免失敗與挽回失敗，最重要的條件是要能看淸客觀的歷史趨勢，採用適當的適應方略，服從歷史演進規律，時時革新自己的行動。</p>
<p>旅行一週</p>
<h3>雲台山</h3>
<p>— 漫之</p>
<p>雲台山（又名蒼梧山）原是海州山峯的總名，她不是一個獨立的山峯，所謂遊雲台山，不過指她最精彩的地方罷了。她的勝跡不止一處，最値得瀏覽的是：東磊，宿城，前頂，墟溝。這四處的位置相隔很遠，所以自來遊雲台的人大都沒有徧遊四處，同時先去那兒，後去那兒也沒有一定的路綫。我們這次的出發點是新浦，到前頂和墟溝去交通比較便利，所以就先登前頂了。</p>
<p>前頂距新縣約七八里，相傳爲舊東海縣治，現屬灌雲，距新浦約三十里，新溝長途汽車直達（去年三四月便通車），隴海車也在對面的山麓停駛（鹽塲站）。不過我們爲了避免買票候車的麻煩，頭一晚間×君便呌好兩乘人力車，第二天早晨還不到五點鐘，忠實於自己的生活的車夫便來催請了。我們揉着惺忪的眼睛坐上了車。讓他拖上新墟大道。這時曉霧迷漫，見不着路旁的景物，凉風拂面，身上微微感到寒意。然而一想到給公文尺牘生活壓倦了的我，能够呼吸這樣新鮮的空氣，而且名山美景快要吸進眼簾，心裏却又湧起無限的快樂。不久太陽漸漸露出笑臉，曉烟漸漸飛散，有名的鹽塲，便東一塊，西一塊的擺在眼前了。有的鹽塲已經參差的羅列着鹽堆，有的正在灌水，鹽伕們都赤脚露腿的在塲里努力工作：或車水，或刮鹽（1灌水後一二天，鹽質已經沉澱，放出一部分淸水，其餘的讓牠蒸發，鹽伕們便在這時用木耙把鹽刮成許多小堆）。</p>
<p>約莫八點鐘左有，到達了新縣，這是一座破舊的古城，街道狹隘，房屋矮小，實無足稱述，不過牠的位置是背靠山麓，面對山峯，却也有幾分淸幽氣象。我們只在遭兒小歇會，便徒步走向目的地。踏着鄉村小徑，經過了大小兩個村落，沿途人家稀少，屋外大都圍繞着石墻，稍大的莊院還有砲樓巍立。據說先經過的那個村落名呌小村，後者名大村（原名大義村，又名免村），從前有個金翀先生，路過這兒，曾吟詠一詩：「風掃織雲月露痕，道旁石劍暗疑門，肩輿差比吳船穩，一路看山到兌村。」這一帶的山峯固多，可是「肩輿」却沒有見着，也許給小車和洋車「否定」了。</p>
<p>由大村出來使是盤桓曲折的山路，仰望最高山峯，如像一座寶塔，×君算是「識途老馬」，根熟悉的領着我由第一天門（這是登山的第一個孔道，故呌第一天門。）經十八盤磴遊。迴旋而上。十八盤看來不甚高，可是有十八個迴旋，又覺頗費脚力了。好在前面便是一匹小嶺，道路稍平，還可安閒的呼一口氣。嶺上的土質呈靑綠色，間或有一叚土壤凸起，好像竹節，故名竹節嶺。約行五六里，仰見林木巍森，一關聳峙，道便是南天鬥。道路愈漸狹小，怪石參差的嵌在巖上，走到道兒，心里自然的發生恐怖，脚步也自然的緩慢，好似眞的到了天上的甫天門。我們微曲着身軀，攀援着石頭小樹，緩緩的上去，這時的心裏不知是甜是苦，不過「遊興」是暫時消逝了。登上天門，俯視下面衆山如像拱手朝賀，前頂的莊嚴和受人景仰之處，大概就在道點了。地勢中部高，東西低，西邊便是竹節嶺，香爐峯，南爲孔雀溝，遙望朐山，大伊，伊盧諸山，若列屏嶂，三元宮縹緲空際，好似海市蜃樓，遊人到了這兒，難免不吁吁喘息。好在前面有座廟字，可以歇氣，廟名武安宮，建築的年代已不可考，據說爲沭陽知縣劉烺重修，然而墻壁依然灰暗，標棟也已經古舊了。前門的匾上題有「高鎮南天」四字，兩邊有聯曰：「義氣王霄，近指白雲開覺路；威聲走海，遙憑赤手挽洪流，」字句爲陶澍所題（陶澍字子霖，嘉慶進士，道光間官兩江總督，卒謚文毅。）廟後的上端有石門，可坐，可臥，秋風拂拂，身心俱爽，故名風門。由道兒到九龍橋，羊腸石徑，螺旋而下，愈走愈狹，漸趨釜底，到了道兒，已經望不着山下，好似天下的最低處。九龍橋又名萬壽橋，橋身甚大，上有九龍將軍廟，道光十六年重修，現爲十餘僧衆所居，每當正月廟會起時香火甚旺，僧衆即靠道時施中們的布施來維持一年的用度。我們在廟內休息一會，佾人捧過茶來，吃罷帶來的餅乾，給了一元茶資，然後鼓起精力，沿着石梯，循二十四氣，度七十四級登上靑峯頂（即前頂）的最高處。這時俯視南天門，靑松翠柏如像靄霧祥雲，自身已疑不在人間了。</p>
<p>靑峯頂爲雲台山主峯，明唐伯元「遊靑峯頂記中說」「環東海而山者以千數，而靑峯頂爲之赤，其高處鷄嗚可見日，是日靑峯，俗名淸風，誤也。海上秋冬之族，草凋木落，獨此山居翠微間，延裏山里，皆茂林修竹，四時常靑，又頂七泉沃，處處皆濕履，草潤如初夏，頂多巨石，產萬年松，經霜愈秀，是謂靑峯。」如記中所說，道兒眞是桃源仙境，但據我看來，林木並不算「茂一，竹也不「修」，不過因山高而影勢奇突，同時又有稀疏的樹木裝點裝點，在這黃沙飛揚的亞北方（淮北），自然要算是美妙的勝境了。老實地說，這樣的山形如果再加上江南的「鶯飛草長，雜花生樹」，那纔是真眞的「世外桃源」哩！</p>
<p>「顧志」載：「本山原名靑峯頂，因建三元聖宇，遂名雲台，以方輿考之，即海中蒼梧山也。」從此可知雲台山雖是東海各山的總稱，但靑峯頂（即前頂）纔是眞真的雲台山，當地人所說的雲台便是專指道兒了。</p>
<p>靑峯頂的前面是香爐頂，後面是金牛頂（俗呼後頂，相傳金牛二師曾在這兒修道，做有是名），山峯相連，中隔不過二果許。擴說靑峯頂高七百米突，金牛頂高七百五十米突，算來金牛頂更高，不過因爲趕不上靑峯頂的景色，也就不甚爲人所注竟了。我們到金牛頂來，無非爲了登山必達其巓，同時也是一不做二不休之意。金牛頂上原有一樓名海曙，又名望日，始建於萬曆年間，乾隆時，江都程鐅有句云：「絕幟有樓今瓦礫，殘碑無字已莓苔」，可知此樓傾圯已久，現今可供瀏覽的，只有一個金牛洞，但又爲珠絲封鎖，里面黑沉沉的，一無可取。不過金牛頂究爲雲台山的最高處，立足頂上遙望四境，村落田園，盡收入眼中，如果是在早晨，還可見着朝日初昇的美麗呢！</p>
<p>最後，由金牛頂折回靑峯頂，轉向三元宮。此廟曾幾度改建過，據說創自宋仁宗皇祐七年，明神宗萬曆十五年，山陽人謝淳毀家獨建，十年始落成。淸康熙十六年又重修，後至嘉慶道光迭次重修，並且還有御賜匾額，還有皇帝命侍衛進香等盛况，可見這座廟宇的歷史是很光榮尊貴的了。可是現在仍是破舊不堪，神像也將要傾倒，到而今再也沒有人來培補裝修，好像菩薩也在走惡運了。三元殿後有水簾洞，洞中泉水徐徐流出，如像細小的珠廉，這却給三元宮增色不少。稍東又有華嚴洞，洞外瀑布作爲天然的珠簾，四邊峭璧陡立，有鬼斧神工之妙。據說洞內很寬闊，暑天冒水攢入，如關在冰箱里那麽涼爽。</p>
<p>三元宮附近有名的勝跡很多，東南邊有天然碑，碑上爲一綫天，碑側爲嘯雲洞，朝陽澗等，西南有衆樂台，西有屏山社，今名西竹園，爲佾衆所居，不過大都碌碌平凡，看過了許多勝景，再看這兒，實在引不起更高的興趣。</p>
<p>據說雲峯的松樹很多，很奇特，而西澗（西竹園之西）的蟠</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>龍松尤稱奇古。當北宋時已稱為三代遺物，可是到了光緒二十五年，實應人來此進香，無意中插香在松樹的孔穴間，因為年老質枯，容易惹火，於是　　壽的蟠龍便給舉行了火葬典禮！而今所存的只有疏落的幾株萬年松了！</p>
<p>遊罷各處勝跡，心里不免起了一點兒感想：雲台山確是一個好地方；周遭的環境，自身奇特的形勢，都使牠成為「名山勝景」，可惜年代久遠，漸漸變得衰老憔悴，過去的許多勝跡大都趨於湮沒了！</p>

<h3>武裝的非洲</h3>
<p>— 包森</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞京城通訊</p>
<p>現在，非洲雖然也有許多白人和棕色人種，但其居民的最大多數乃是黑人。所以，如果只是表面地單從人種的數量來說，那非洲便可說是黑人的非洲了。然而事實卻恰與此相反，大部分的非洲土地早為歐洲列強所分割，現在雖然表面上還有幾個獨立國家存在，但它們的政治經濟的實權仍是操在歐美列強的手中，所謂「黑人的非洲」這句話，只是在形式上裏面上才有一點兒意義；依據實際情形，應該說是白人（更正確地說，應該是歐美列強）的非洲的。</p>
<p>在大戰之前，英法德意等國在非洲都有很多殖民地。後德國的非洲領土雖然喪失，但這些地方並未因之成為獨立的國家，而是轉屬於英法等國的。茲將非洲所有的三個獨立國與列強的領土的面積和人口列表如下：</p>
<p>依據上表，我們可知非洲的三個獨立國，無論在人口和土地面積方面，都不及英法任何一國所領有者。這個事實很明顯地表現着：非洲黑人的最大多數直到現在還直接地被列強所統治所奴役：如果嚴格說來，甚至可說整個非洲的黑人及其國土都是歐美列強宰割之下，因為非洲雖有三個在表面上的獨立國家，但它們在各方面都是被歐美列強控制着的。</p>
<p>我們且先說黑人在非洲的三個獨立國的實際情形吧。第一，阿比西尼亞是在英法意三國爭奪下的，現在東菲的風雲緊急，正是表現英法意等國在阿衝突的尖銳，也正是阿國乃至全非黑人決定自己的命運的時機：這是誰都知道的。第二，埃及雖然在一九二二年已獲得英國承認其為獨立王國，但實際上仍沒有脫離英人的覊絆。至於里比利亞，則是黑人在世界上唯一的共和國，雖然牠在各方面尙受英美列強的支配，但是許多地方卻值得特別提出來談論的。</p>
<p>里比利亞共和國建立於一八四七年，是美國解放的黑奴組織成的。其政治組織完全取法於美國，設有正副大總統，並有上下兩院。教育也不能說很落後，全國共有學校一百七八十所，學生約有六七千人。在貿易上是以美金為本位，但在商業方面卻是使用英鎊。一九三二年的歲入為四七六千美圓，歲出為六三五千美圓，由此當可到其財政之困難了。單以比利亞非法附在英美之下不可的。</p>
<p>世界唯一的黑人共和國的國都名門羅菲亞，是取兩美總統門羅之名。這里共有一萬一千人口，是一貿易港。因為氣候很熱，土地肥美，所以產物如樹膠，椰子油，棉花，咖啡，豐牙，染色村料等都很豐富。</p>
<p>在大戰前，里比利亞是在英美的領土之包圍中，當然說不上真正的自由。戰時且被置在德國勢力範圍之下，連表面的獨立都幾乎失掉了。後來才在美國的支持之下實行對德宣戰，高唱「黑人的阿非利加」。但是戰後里比利亞並未獲得實際的利益，牠在經濟上依然不能脫離英美的支配。美國因為急需樹膠等原料，所以對於非洲極其關心，里比里亞便是其走入非洲的一個重要道路。近來里比利亞人雖然正在努力爭取真正的自由，繼續喊叫「黑人的阿非利加」，但還沒有很大的成績表現出來；他們要想求得真正的解放，還須繼續努力才行。</p>
<p>至於這三個「獨立國」以外的非洲黑人，那更是為歐洲列強直接壓迫着的。當歐洲資本主義的勢力開始侵入阿非利加時，這里的黑人社會還在原始狀態中，來此的白人起先甚至把他們當作野獸看待，後來才「大發慈悲」以他們為奴隸。同時，那時非洲黑人的土地私有觀念還很淡漠，於是「文明的」白人就乘機去奪取他們的土地。這便是列強的實踐殖民學的第一課。隨着更以黑人為奴隸，強迫他們為自己勞動，並對他們施行各種的懲罰。此種情形，在剛果，在以前的德領，英領，法領，特別是在東菲都充分的表現着但是，黑人在這些「文明人」的壓迫之下當然是很苦痛的，再隨着他們知識的發展，就必然地要起來反抗，爭取獨立與自由。如過去埃及回教徒和南菲波耳人的反英運動，怯尼亞人的組織東菲聯邦，摩洛哥里夫民族的獨立運動，以及大里比利亞運動等等，都是非洲黑人為求獨立自由的英勇的精神表現，在這中間，他們曾流了許多的熱血，犧牲了許多的精力和生命，以圖獲得其民族與自身的解放。雖然直到而今他們還未完全達到目的，但其精神卻是值得稱讚的；而且，就是他們過去流的熱血也並不是白費，事實上在他們的英勇的反抗精神威脅之下，統治他們的列強也不得不作相當的讓步以求緩和。如英國之許埃及獨立（雖然是表面的），法國在摩洛哥的高壓政策之改變，葡萄牙，西班牙，比利時等之相當地改變其壓迫黑人的態度，都不能不說是由他們的不斷反抗所得來的。</p>
<p>最近，因為意阿爭鬬日益緊急，整個非洲黑人都非常憤慨。除阿比西尼亞早已全體動員外，其他舅埃及，如里比利亞，如英法西葡比利時所領的黑人亦都表示願為其種族犧牲，就是意大利領土內的士兵和一般黑人亦時舉叛幟，反對向黑人國家進攻；駐英南菲辦事專員華特在國聯會上且發出這樣的警告：「武裝的非洲終必起而推翻歐洲」；南菲代表狄華泰亦宣稱：「征服之戰爭必在一日自食其嚴重之結果，蓋菲洲各處勢將風起雲湧，以抗此種罪惡！」——由此可見一向被「文明人」所壓迫的非洲黑人，也是未可輕視的。</p>

<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>電影界助賑遊藝會昨日在中央西菜社招待新聞界。</p>
<p>茶點之後，繼以報告：</p>
<p>上次各界籌賑水災遊藝會所募得款項是三萬多元，除了尙有未收到之外，匯到各災區去的是一萬五千元，而會方面各項開支，大概也在萬元左右。</p>
<p>（希望諸大善士能節省一些，這樣近乎三分之一的開支，實在未免太大了因為後方究意不及災區的需款孔亟，）</p>
<p>這次電影界助賑遊藝會，除平劇，話劇，歌曲，電影之餐，還有明星伴舞，明星伴舞的辦法是十元一跳，不過，這十元一跳還得碰碰運氣，「大善士」把十元「捐」上去，會方面給他一次轉盤的「權利，」轉到誰，便和誰跳。這種「公平交易，」據說是為免得紅明星們太辛苦而想出來的。（據某方面傳出的消息：要指定紅明星們跳是也可以的，不過代價是每跳一百元。）</p>
<p>除明星伴舞之外，（時間是十點至二點）在十點之前，還向九大舞場去借了四十五名舞女來，代價呢，是每元一跳。（和女明星比較起來是十與一之比，換言之，女明星的身價是比舞女高十倍。）</p>
<p>完了。</p>
<p>或人曰：我主張把胡蝶等幾位紅星收歸國有，實行「中華民國之妻」的辦法，票子不妨買一百元一張，或再貴點，號碼也不妨改一百萬號或五百萬號，如此，這二十四年的大水災，可以借明星似的大力而得救也。</p>
<p>胡蝶等伴舞消息傳出之後，有「蝶迷」或「徐來迷」的窮小子聽了，打算用葉沙成塔方法先來抽一抽簽，然後，由抽得者做一下「大善士」去碰碰運氣轉上一轉。</p>
<p>或人預料：明星伴舞，電通及聯華公司的女明星將不會參加，胡蝶恐也不會參加，而陳玉梅是在滬，必參加無疑，即使此公不會舞，也必定進什麼舞校速成科去速成。</p>

<h3>Stalled Mediation of the West Gong Banner Dispute; To Proceed After Discussion at the Mongolian Political Council; General Peace Prevails in Areas Near West Gong Banner</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Mediation of the West Gong Banner dispute has stalled due to the entrenched positions of both sides. It is said that the matter must await discussion at the third plenary session of the Mongolian Political Council before proceeding. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission plans to instruct Bai Yunti and Kexing'e to mediate opportunistically during their attendance at the Mongolian Political Council. Bai and Ke are expected to pass through Beiping from the capital on their way to the temple on October 4th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yunshi dispute remains unresolved. Yun Wang recently telegraphed Chairman Jiang and President Wang, reporting on the handling of the matter and requesting that Shi Wang be dismissed by explicit order to quell the dispute. Batu Bayar, the Assistant Banner Chief, is to temporarily act as the Banner's Jasak. Both sides are now awaiting central government's decision. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that the Rehe Province will hold a conference with Japanese Consular Officers from various counties, starting on the 26th of this month, lasting three days, to discuss reforms to the Mongolian Banner system. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the West Banner dispute in Inner Mongolia, the Mongolian Political Council sent a long telegram to Beiping yesterday, instructing Bao Yueqing, the director of the Council's Beiping office, to forward it to Jiang and Wang. The message expressed two points, but contained many errors and is currently being actively revised. Once revised, it will be sent out immediately. The Mongolian Political Council has scheduled its third plenary session for the ninth of next month. Committee members stationed in the capital, including Wu Heling, Bai Yunti, and Kexing'e, will all travel to Mongolia to attend. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Yueqing stated that a solution to the West Gong Banner dispute will be proposed for discussion at the third plenary session of the Mongolian Political Council. General peace prevails in areas near West Gong Banner. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a source, the areas under various Mongolian Leagues and Banners in Inner Mongolia are currently peaceful. However, aircraft from a certain power occasionally conduct reconnaissance flights, and Rehe troops also patrol the Mongolian-Rehe border from time to time. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Yangqu: Pan Wang is currently receiving medical treatment for an eye ailment in Bing. He is scheduled to visit the cabinet in the coming days to report on the true situation of the West Gong Banner dispute. According to his entourage, all the Mongolian princes advocate a peaceful resolution and have already jointly telegraphed Yun Wang and Shi Wang to urge reconciliation. A peaceful resolution is expected soon. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Xinjiang Joining the Soviet Union are Untrustworthy</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Yuanfu, Xinjiang's representative in the capital, telegraphed Governor Sheng on the 25th to inquire about rumors spread by a certain country that Xinjiang had joined the Soviet Union. The original telegram stated: "Confidential to Governor Sheng of Dihua, alarming reports have been telegraphed from a certain power in recent days claiming that Xinjiang has joined the Soviet Union and has been renamed the Turkestan Soviet Republic. A rapid reply is urgently requested to allow for rectification. Yuan Shen respectfully inquires." Sheng replied: "To Representative Zhang Yuanfu, Tianjin, confidential: The rumors of Xinjiang seceding from China are not worthy of a knowing person's smile. Given your brother's knowledge and deep understanding of me, how could you be fooled by propagandists? Since I assumed the position of governor, I have sworn to preserve Xinjiang and ensure that it remains Chinese territory forever. I hope you will dispel the rumors. Respectfully, Sheng Shicai." (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) An official in charge of the Xinjiang office in Tianjin stated that the reports from a certain power that Xinjiang had joined the Soviet Union are completely unfounded. Communication between here and Xinjiang is frequent, and there have been no political changes. Furthermore, dependents of the Northeastern Volunteer Army stationed in Xinjiang are being continuously transported to Xinjiang. To date, more than forty people have arrived in Xinjiang, and fifteen people in Tianjin, sixty in Beiping, and forty-four in Suiyuan have registered and are preparing to depart. In addition, many dependents of civil servants plan to travel west on the 16th Xinjiang-Suiyuan train on October 3rd. The 17th train is also scheduled to depart around February 10th next year. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Japan's Policy Toward China As Reported in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Will Be Formally Announced</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Asahi Shimbun, Prime Minister Okada and the Ministers of the Army and Navy have agreed on a new Japanese policy toward China, which will be presented by Foreign Minister Hirota at the next cabinet meeting. The newspaper also stated that Finance Minister Takahashi also strongly supports this new policy. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Japan's policy toward China, taking the North China Incident in May as a turning point, it has abandoned a wait-and-see attitude and adopted a positive approach. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, the Navy, and the Ministry of Finance have repeatedly met to negotiate a policy toward China to deal with the current situation. As a result, a consensus has been generally reached. Prime Minister Okada, Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Kawashima, and Navy Minister Osumi met on the 27th and decided to codify this consensus into a written document as the Japanese government's definitive policy toward China. Since its content centers on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it will be formally decided at a cabinet meeting attended by Finance Minister Takahashi and then announced. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota visited Finance Minister Takahashi at 9:30 AM on the 28th to report on recent international developments and the content of Rose's proposal regarding joint British-Japanese economic assistance to China. He then explained that Japan, faced with the current state of Sino-Japanese relations, must abandon its wait-and-see attitude and actively resolve overall Sino-Japanese relations. Prime Minister Okada, Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Kawashima, and Navy Minister Osumi have agreed that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should be the core of the policy toward China, but since this policy is of great importance to the Ministry of Finance, the opinions of all ministers were consistent in seeking the Minister of Finance's specific views on this matter before a formal decision could be made. Finance Minister Takahashi expressed his agreement with this policy. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's policy toward China has reached an understanding among the four relevant ministries. Because Foreign Minister Hirota needs to communicate this policy to various agencies stationed in China, he has internally ordered Morishima, the First Section Chief of the East Asia Bureau, to be dispatched to China. The Section Chief is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for China in early October. (Dentsu dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Yosuke Matsuoka assumed the presidency of the South Manchuria Railway Company (Mantetsu), Director Sasaki proceeded to establish the budget for the next year and a five-year plan to be implemented starting next year. Recently, the original plan was completed, and Director Sasaki came to Tokyo to seek the opinions of the Tokyo banking groups and the Ministry of Finance authorities. He is scheduled to return to Dalian on the 5th of next month to submit it to the board of directors for formal approval. It is reported that the content of the original plan stipulates that the expenditure for undertakings after next year will be drastically reduced, and new planned undertakings, such as the development of North China's economy, will absolutely not be implemented if there are no income and expenditure figures. Regarding the development of North China's economy, the investment problem of the North China economic development undertaking is currently under investigation. Although there is a need to implement these plans, they will not be adopted if revenue and expenditure cannot be offset. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Mantetsu has scheduled a budget meeting for the fiscal year of Showa 11 (1936) at the Dalian headquarters on October 18th. Director Sasaki, who is in charge of the management department, left Dalian today to go east to the capital because it was necessary to request the understanding of the investing syndicate, the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, and the Ministry of Finance authorities. On the occasion of his departure, the director said that the purpose of going to the capital at this time was to request the investing syndicate to understand the capital plan, so there would be no specific negotiations on expanding the limits of corporate bonds. As for the funds for developing North China, although the director in charge has decided, the specific plan is still under research and has not yet been decided. (Dentsu dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moji: A delegation from the Beiping Municipal Government of China, sent to Japan for investigation, arrived in Moji on the Jing Shan Maru from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 27th. Wu Chengti, a Councillor of the Beiping Municipal Government and the head of the delegation, issued the following statement: "This delegation, under the order of Mayor Yuan, plans to inspect Japan's general administration, education, and commerce and industry over a period of 26 days. We will also visit the ancient culture of Nara, to serve as a reference for the prosperity policy of Beiping, which has been declining for the past 20 years. We also intend to exchange opinions with prominent figures in Japan's government and public to plan for the realization of Sino-Japanese cooperation." (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Tada's Statement that the Japan's Views on China Do Not Represent the Intentions of the Japanese Government and Military; The Japanese-Language Keijin Nichinichi Shimbun Has Corrected It</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A Japanese newspaper carried yesterday a small booklet published in Tianjin on the 25th by Tada, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, entitled "Basic Japanese Views on China." The content was divided into seven items and was extremely bizarre. According to reliable sources, the opinions expressed by the commander do not represent the intentions of his government and military, and the Japanese-language Keijin Nichinichi Shimbun has already corrected it on the 26th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Man Hayashi Yasushi Arrives in Beiping to Investigate Cultural Affairs</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Hayashi Yasushi, the First Section Chief of the Cultural Affairs Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Beiping this morning on the Beiping-Shenyang train. He is scheduled to stay in Beiping for five days, and from the 30th, he will inspect the cultural institutions run by Japanese expatriates in Beiping. He is scheduled to leave Beiping for Tianjin on the third of next month, and then travel from Tianjin to Jinan, Qingdao, and other places for inspection. According to Hayashi, he was ordered by the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to come to China to investigate the cultural undertakings run by Japanese expatriates in China and the current state of China's cultural circles. He is scheduled to inspect Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Hankou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fujian, and other places in China, and then leave China for Japan around the 15th or 16th of next month. China and Japan share the same race and culture, and have a long history of cultural relations. At this time when Sino-Japanese relations are improving, cultural cooperation between the two countries is especially the precursor to all cooperation. I will provide what I have learned from this inspection to the people of my country after returning home to promote Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation. Hayashi also said that the Japanese people have always greatly revered Confucius and the spirit of Confucianism. Confucianism is very popular in both upper and lower society in Japan. Japanese customs have been greatly influenced by the teachings of Confucius, so it is common to respect Confucius. If time permits, I will go to Konglin to pay my respects. Hayashi intends to meet with famous figures and scholars in Beiping to exchange general opinions on the issue of Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>The counties of Miyun and Huairou are consulting on joint defense measures; Zhang Qingyu is inspecting defenses in various places</p>
<p>(Beiping) The county governments of Miyun and Huairou, citing local unrest, convened a county-wide conference today to discuss joint defense measures. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miyun reports that Zhang Qingyu, the Commander of the First Security Brigade of Hebei Province, went from Beiping to Shixia Town, Huairou, Miyun yesterday afternoon to inspect the defense status of the various companies of the First Battalion under his command. He also discussed plans to prevent and suppress bandits with Wang Bolin, the Magistrate of Miyun County, Deng Wenhan, the Commander of the Security Brigade, and others. He returned to Beiping this morning. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the evening of the 27th, more than sixty bandits armed with complete weaponry suddenly poured into Hefengkou, northeast of Huairou, from outside the Pass. They looted Xiliushui Village completely, kidnapping twelve men and women as hostages, and killing two abbots of a certain temple and one hostage. That night, they retreated along the original route out of Hefengkou. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The 29th Army Headquarters Moves to Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The 132nd Division of the 29th Army, under Zhao Dengyu, has been transferred to garrison Beiping and Tianjin. It has departed from Chahar and is expected to arrive in Beiping in full force in early October. The headquarters of the 29th Army is also being moved to Qinghe. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Dikes Collapse; Donghai and Shuyang Counties Issue Emergency Alerts</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) A coastal dispatch reports that a breach of more than thirty yards has occurred in the Shizhuang Pingdun Village dike in the Dongshu River's environment. He Zheng纲, the magistrate of Donghai County, is supervising the civilians to rush to repair the breach, and has ordered all circles in Hai to build a final dike to prevent water from flooding the city. At the same time, the Da Liu Lake is also in critical condition. Seven thousand refugees are working day and night to protect it, and are required to build a forty-mile ring dike within three days. County Magistrate Deng Xianghai, along with engineers Yuan and Xue, have personally gone to supervise the work. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Huaiyin) Six breaches, each more than ten yards wide, have occurred at Lianshui Zhou Shenji and Sun Zhuang Liutang. The disaster victims are gathered on the river dikes, trying to rush to repair the breaches. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Wang Mengzhou, the chief of engineering of the Guiding the Huai River into the Sea Project Office, has returned from an inspection along Liutang and the Yangzhuang Dam. He stated that the breaches in the area around Liutang Yangkou Zhouji have been effectively repaired, preventing a major disaster from occurring. The water level of Liutang within Huaisi territory is stable, and the same is true for the Yangzhuang Dam. The officials and people of the counties in the Yishu River tailwater area have been able to work hard, and human effort has been exhausted. However, at this time when the autumn flood water level is rising sharply, it is concerning if the openings in Shandong are not blocked. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Residents in the area of Xiaodian Zhangwei in the northeast of Liucheng are preparing wooden rafts day and night to escape in case the water from Liutang and the Chaimi River floods westward. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Economic Commission Sends Personnel to Survey Flood Control</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Yang Baoyu, a technician from the Water Conservancy Department of the National Economic Commission, arrived in Hai from the capital on the morning of the 28th. At noon, he visited Xu Dingkang and Xu Xinwu, the two flood control directors of the Canal Zone and the Yishu River Zone, for discussions. It is reported that Yang's mission is due to the opposition of Xu Hai and other counties to the Sushu Dam, especially the most forceful attack from the three counties of Dongguan Liuyang, who say that the flow of Liutang has exceeded three times that of the Central Canal, and that if Liutang has a bank collapse, not only will Shuguan be affected, but also the national salt pan's twenty million tax revenue will suffer. The local flood control authorities said that the dredging of Liutang last year was originally for the discharge of the Yishu River, and now that the Yishu River has not risen, it is natural to use it for flood discharge. As for the Sushu Dam, it will be handled according to the resolution of the Economic Commission meeting. At present, the two sides are still arguing, so Yang was sent to survey. In the afternoon, Yang went north along the Central Canal. He heard that after arriving in Su, he would go east along Liutang, take the road through Shuyang Shuguan Lianhou, and return to Beijing via Hai and Xu to report to the commission to solve the aforementioned problem. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>County Civilians Rush to Build Various Dikes</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Haiqu Special Commissioner's Office, believing that the breaches in the Liutang River and the Dashi, Wengong, Hanyang, and other rivers are the only guarantee for the three counties of Hai, Guan, and Shu, strictly ordered each county to defend them, and sent Yang Daming to the dikes to join the county magistrates in strengthening the protection. Currently, the civilians of the three counties are still working hard to build various dikes, but after Shuyang was hit by the disaster, it became a swamp everywhere and there was nothing to levy. The people's livelihood is extremely difficult. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Canal Water has risen sharply in recent days. The Guiding the Huai River into the Sea Project Office is deeply afraid that the Yangzhuang Dam in Huaiyin will overflow or that other breaches will occur, affecting the entire downstream project. It has now raised the West Dam, which was abandoned for purchase, and the old dam at Jiudukou by several feet, as a second line of defense. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The right bank of the Dashi Village dike on the opposite bank of the Wengong River in Guanyun overflowed and breached on the 28th, and Tanggouji was surrounded by water on all sides. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Assistance Committee Returned to the Province Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The six provincial committee members previously sent by the Provincial Government to assist the counties in preventing the Yellow River flood and providing disaster relief have now returned to the province to report, as the flood prevention project is over and relief sub-committees have been established in each county, and the temporary task has come to an end. The province ordered the special commissioner's office to establish relief sub-committees in each county in northern Jiangsu that has not been affected by the disaster to assist neighboring counties with relief. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>The Breaching Closure Project is Currently Underway; Work-Relief Relief for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Dian Chen Guofu said that the breaching closure project is now transporting materials and building the bases of the east and west dams. After the flood season is over, the funds and materials will be sufficient, and it can be completed in one fell swoop. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Breaching Closure Project Office has now been established in Dongzhuang, and the joint transport project of the Grand Canal in Taochengbu will start, with a cost of 370,000 yuan, which will be used for work-relief to help disaster victims. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Hubei Work-Relief Repair of Dikes Requires Nine Million Yuan</h3>

<h3>The Difficulty of European Politicians</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since the last great war, today is the day European politicians face the greatest difficulty. Although the situation of France's occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 was serious, it was not as extensively involved as today. At that time, the situation in Europe was like a volcano after its initial eruption. Although people were panicked, there was no possibility of it erupting again. Today, it is like a volcano that has been extinguished and is gradually reviving. The explosive power it contains is already very terrifying. The dispute between Italy and Abyssinia has turned into a confrontation between Britain and Italy. The autumn clouds that shrouded the diplomatic stage of Geneva have suddenly condensed into a murderous aura over the Mediterranean. In recent months, although the experienced and smooth Baldwin and Hoare have replaced MacDonald and Simon in Britain, and French Foreign Minister Laval has traveled back and forth to lobby, the situation has not been opened up in the end. Today, the British and French authorities seem to be facing the most difficult questions in political diplomacy courses. However, on the Italian side, although Mussolini appears tough on the surface, he must have the same difficulties in his mind. Internal crises need to be dealt with, and external adventures are difficult to be sure of. Today, the Italian army has completed its mobilization. According to military strategy, it is beneficial to fight a quick battle. However, there are reasons for not shooting the arrow after drawing the bow.</p>
<p>In short, the biggest problem that European politicians encounter today is the uncertainty of the scope and ultimate outcome of the war. What Britain is worried about is that once the war breaks out, the Indian sea route will inevitably be cut off first, and Britain's African territories will be threatened, and may even cause colonial rebellion, leading to the disintegration of the empire. What France fears is the impact of the war on Central Europe after it is launched. Because if Italy has problems in the Red Sea, the Danube River basin in its rear will be very empty. The ambitious Germany can take the opportunity to advance into Austria and threaten French territory. The situation created by the Treaty of Versailles will be completely shattered as a result, and the result of the mixed war is unimaginable. Italy is also aware of this situation. In fact, Mussolini has little confidence in the outcome of the East African war. He is even more worried about the interference of British power in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. But his biggest difficulty is how to overcome the internal crisis if the war stops halfway. In recent months, everything inside Italy has become a wartime organization. The gold reserves of the National Bank have decreased, the lira has depreciated, and unemployed workers have been transferred to the East African front. Patriotic enthusiasm has concealed the people's living difficulties. If they suddenly turn back, the real crisis will be exposed. At present, Italy is indeed in a dilemma. That is why Feng has repeatedly announced the huge expenses used by the Italian army in East Africa in the past year, the purpose of which is to explain his difficulties and show that it is difficult to stop without a considerable price.</p>
<p>Britain has repeatedly tried to answer the current difficult questions. When Eden visited Rome, he proposed to cede the Ogaden region in southern Abyssinia to Italy, and Britain would compensate Abyssinia's losses with the port of Zeila in British Somaliland. When the Paris Three-Nation Conference was convened, Britain also advocated dividing Abyssinia into the spheres of influence of Britain, Italy, and France based on the Anglo-Italian secret agreement of 1916. And at this League of Nations conference, Hoare also stated that colonial raw materials can be peacefully distributed and there is no need to seize them by force. France is caught between Britain and Italy, speaking for both sides. But Mussolini seems to feel that the price offered by Britain is not enough to solve Italy's own difficulties. Mussolini's own answer is to make Abyssinia a protectorate of Italy, but this has become a difficult problem that Britain cannot accept.</p>
<p>According to recent dispatches, war clouds are clearly gathering over the Mediterranean, and Italy's attitude seems to have softened slightly. The League of Nations committee is also resuming some activities in despair, planning to find a satisfactory answer again. At the same time, there are rumors from the Italian side that Mussolini's position is tending to be shaken. It is difficult to judge whether this news is reliable. What we can be sure of is that the current European political difficulties have very little hope of being completely resolved. Today's European politicians have no fundamental difference from those before the Great War in their domestic and foreign policies. This is the root cause of all the difficulties. To solve their difficulties, we can only start with fundamental reforms. Otherwise, the tragedy of 1914 is bound to be repeated once.</p>
<p>(New York) Roosevelt's Declaration: Implementing Naval Policy. The US Government has not received news from the British side. The rumor that Britain and France have signed a mutual assistance treaty is not accurate. President Roosevelt stated to the press today on his way to give speeches in various places that the United States will continue to implement its previous naval policy. It will only change this policy when it is no longer possible to renew the international naval treaty. That is, if there is no hope of signing a new treaty, the United States will abandon its old naval policy only when other countries build ships beyond the limits of the old treaty. The current US shipbuilding program is no different from the situation in the past two and a half years. Even if the US Navy reaches the treaty limit in 1942, the United States will abide by the Washington and London treaties, and will only change its policy when it is no longer possible to renew these treaties or any country abolishes the treaties. However, it still depends on whether other countries exceed the treaty limit. After President Roosevelt arrives at the Santee Diego naval base on Wednesday, he will review a fleet of 130 ships and will give speeches in Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Santee Diego. He will take the Panama Canal on his return trip. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) News reporters today asked Secretary of State Hull about the news that Britain will greatly increase its navy. Hull replied that there was no change in the naval situation. He had not received news from the British government that it wanted to change the world's naval status quo. The US Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, reported this matter to the State Department, saying that the British government had announced that the Daily Mail and the Daily Express had stated that Britain would notify the United States within days, wanting to invoke the "automatic escalator" clause in the London Naval Convention as a small certainty. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Admiralty plans to build 21 warships in accordance with the 1925 shipbuilding program. It is said that it has inquired about the cost from several shipyards, including three cruisers, one leader ship, eight destroyers, one submarine repair ship, four small warships, and one survey ship, with a total cost of approximately £10 million. (Havas Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) All sectors related to the League of Nations are now increasingly pessimistic about the peaceful resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. However, at the same time, it is rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has notified the French Ambassador to Rome that he is willing to negotiate the case, and there is even talk of submitting a proposal on Sunday. Regarding what action the US President will take regarding sanctions, Professor Piou, President of the US Foreign Affairs Association, has just issued a statement proposing five methods: (1) Withdraw diplomatic representatives stationed in Italy; (2) Do not recognize any situation created by Italy in Abyssinia in violation of the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (3) Prohibit the transport of military materials to Italy; (4) Acquiesce to the League of Nations implementing a sales ban on Italy; (5) Close the Suez Canal. (Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that Britain and France are currently negotiating to revise the mutual assistance treaty between the two countries. This statement has been denied by officials. According to Havas News Agency reporters, diplomatic negotiations are currently underway between London and Paris to discuss how the British fleet can obtain French assistance in the event of a conflict between the British and Italian naval fleets in the Mediterranean as a result of the implementation of economic sanctions. The British side believes that the sanctions procedures specified in the League of Nations Covenant will be very slow. Therefore, before that, Britain must first obtain the consent of other countries and provide assistance before it is possible. Therefore, there is a rumor that Britain and France are negotiating to conclude a mutual assistance treaty. (Havas Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Geneva and Rome: A Section of Diplomatic Warfare. The League of Nations General Assembly Adjourns Until Mid-November. The Chairman Says It Enters a New Era in History. The Executive Yuan Also Adjourns Until Next Week.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Since the opening of the 16th League of Nations General Assembly on the 9th of this month, all the issues listed on the agenda have been discussed and concluded one by one. This morning, when the plenary session was held, it was decided to adjourn the meeting until October 10. The League of Nations 1916 budget has been approved, with a total amount of 28,279,90 Swiss francs, of which 1,699,450 francs belong to the International Labor Bureau. The Chairman of the General Assembly, Czech Foreign Minister Pichi, also delivered a speech, mentioning the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, saying that "Representatives of various countries have stated at the General Assembly that the future policies of their governments will be based on respecting the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, we hope that the League of Nations will enter a new era in history and become a new morality in politics, and become a kind of authority in essence." Before the General Assembly announced its adjournment, it also decided that the Chairman of the General Assembly, Pichi, should continue to be in contact with the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, namely Argentine Representative Ginaga, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Irwin, in order to pay for emergency matters. (Havas Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Assembly closed at 11:05 today and approved the resolution of the Economic Committee, allowing any two countries to conclude agreements sufficient to stabilize world trade. At the same time, the Executive Yuan also decided to ask various countries to submit their opinions on the issue of reorganizing the Executive Yuan, so that the members of the Executive Yuan can consider the issue of China's obtaining matters in the Executive Yuan when they meet again on November 15. (National Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly will still be retained to deal with the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. When the presidium met this afternoon, it was decided to submit this proposal to the plenary session of the General Assembly tomorrow. The General Assembly can be convened within 24 hours after issuing the notice. Italian representative Arosee has protested against this, saying that he intends that this move is actually against the League of Nations Constitution, because the General Assembly was not formally convened because of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The Italian-Abyssinian issue has been fully discussed when debating the Secretary-General's report. Therefore, as far as the General Assembly is concerned, this matter can be said to have come to an end. There is no constitutional reason to continue to retain it. From a political observation point of view, this move is enough to be regarded as being determined to put pressure on the Executive Yuan. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Yuan passed a resolution on various issues at a meeting today and then announced its adjournment. It may reconvene next week. (Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>Wilto Senator Bora gave a speech here today, saying that the League of Nations has now become a smokescreen for hypocrites, trying to divide the land of Europe. If war breaks out, its motivation will not be to fight for freedom and human rights, but to fight for cities and land. I therefore oppose sacrificing a single soldier of the United States.

<h3>The Thirteen-Nation Committee Adjourns Until the Beginning of October. It Now Instructs the League of Nations Secretariat to Draft a Report. The Dispatch of Personnel to Abyssinia for Inspection is Submitted for Review.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee instructed the League of Nations Secretariat this morning to prepare a report on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and then adjourned until October 3. British representative Eden claimed during the discussion this morning that it would be beneficial to trace the details of the initial origin of this dispute. The Abyssinian emperor's request to send personnel to Abyssinia to monitor the situation in the event of border conflicts or slight flare-ups has been submitted to the small adjustment committee for review today. A report is submitted in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. It is expected that after this report is drafted, it will be sent to the Thirteen-Nation Committee for review and then announced. However, the Abyssinian emperor's request can be approved only if it receives the unanimous approval of the League of Nations Executive Yuan. Intentionally, Italy's one vote of opposition is enough to cancel this request. At the same time, the Thirteen-Nation Committee must also decide whether sending personnel to Abyssinia is a practical move. (Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Yuan Thirteen-Nation Committee sent a telegram to the Emperor of Abyssinia, stating that the Abyssinian government's suggestion that the League of Nations appoint an investigation team to go to Abyssinia to conduct a fair investigation is now being carefully considered by the Twelve-Nation Committee. Whether this investigation team is allowed by the environment to fulfill its mission is also under consideration. As for the Abyssinian Emperor's decision to withdraw Abyssinian troops 50 kilometers from the border, the Thirteen-Nation Committee has heard and deeply appreciates it. (Havas Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Yuan today accepted in principle the King of Abyssinia's request to send impartial inspectors to Abyssinia, but French Foreign Minister Laval claimed that he had doubts about the actual effectiveness of this move, because the inspectors may not be able to work when they arrive. Laval's statement indicates that the war is imminent and unavoidable. The Abyssinian Emperor's request will actually be shelved invisibly. The Executive Yuan elected Spanish Representative Dalia Gaja as the Chairman of the Thirteen-Nation Committee and then adjourned. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Emperor of Abyssinia requested the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations to appoint an investigation team to the border of his country, the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute accepted it in principle and entrusted French Foreign Ministry African Department Staff Saint-Gong, British Foreign Ministry Egyptian Department Director Thompson, and Spanish Representative Ali Wen to discuss the implementation plan. It is said that they have agreed on the plan and decided to submit a report to the committee for consideration next Sunday, and then submit it to the Executive Yuan for discussion and unanimously passed by all member states before it becomes a final decision. The committee still believes that it is difficult to actually implement the dispatch of an investigation team to the Abyssinian border. (Havas Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian emperor asked the League of Nations to send "sky police" to Abyssinia. The League of Nations is now paying attention to this issue. If it approves, it will probably send eight aircraft, each carrying a driver and an inspector, to patrol the 1,000-mile Abyssinian border, and will tell the Abyssinian government to quickly prepare suitable landing sites for the aircraft. It is believed that the Abyssinian king also asked the League of Nations to send five land inspectors to be stationed at major locations on the border. (Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations General Assembly Reads the US President's Document. Countries Conclude Bilateral Agreements to Reduce Tariff Barriers.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly today announced President Roosevelt's letter, stating that he would abide by the proposal to establish bilateral agreements between countries to reduce tariff barriers and then restore the international gold standard. According to this case, it has been discussed by the General Assembly. This letter from the US President was received by the US representative in Geneva. In this letter, the US President also stated that he strongly supports the proposal to reduce international trade restrictions. (Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>The Italian Cabinet Announces Steps to Withdraw from the League of Nations. It Will be Launched When the League of Nations Implements Sanctions. On the One Hand, It Still Claims to Be Prepared to Compromise with Britain.</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian cabinet issued a document after its meeting this morning, stating that Italy does not want to withdraw from the League of Nations until the League of Nations itself bears the full responsibility for suppressing Italy. Italy has no near or distant purpose of harming British interests. Italy has notified the British government that it is prepared to negotiate an agreement with Britain in the future that will not hinder Britain's legitimate interests in East Africa. The Fascist government now solemnly declares its willingness to avoid actions that could expand the Italian-Abyssinian conflict to other places. The Italian government cannot take seriously the Abyssinian emperor's claim that he has ordered his troops to withdraw 30 kilometers from the border. No truly reputable government can easily make such a decision. This is only for strategic convenience and not for peace. Its purpose is actually to cover up its inland deployment and fortifications in hidden places. Italy's troop movements into East Africa have been accelerating in recent days. The Italian government does not want to take action before the League of Nations, which initially ignored Italy's rights. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Rome) At the cabinet meeting this morning, after Prime Minister Mussolini read a long declaration, it was decided to deal with the international situation as follows: (1) Italy will not withdraw from the League of Nations until the League of Nations imposes sanctions on Italy; (2) The Italian government solemnly declares again that it has no plans to harm Britain. The Italian colonial policy has been notified to the British government at any time since January 29 this year, when Britain and France issued the London Declaration. Recently, although the British people have engaged in anti-Fascist propaganda, the Italian government is still prepared to negotiate and conclude an agreement with Britain to confirm the Taiwanese legal interests enjoyed by Britain in East Africa; (3) The Italian government solemnly declares that any steps that can expand the scope of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute should be avoided. At the end of the cabinet meeting, it was also decided to express condolences on behalf of the Italian nation to the 30,000 troops and workers stationed in Eritrea and Somaliland in East Africa for their efforts to improve the value of the colonies. Finally, it was also decided to issue an order to all citizens nationwide within a short period of time to carry out general mobilization exercises to prove to the world that Italy is united under the Fascist system. (Havas Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Rome) At 10:00 this morning, the Italian cabinet meeting will discuss the resolution of the League of Nations Executive Yuan to send 12 people to form a committee to put forward suggestions on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute based on Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. After the meeting, a common communique will be issued. The Italian authorities' attitude towards the Geneva action is unusually calm and indifferent, but people's hearts have become impatient and anti-British sentiment is increasing. Although British Foreign Secretary Hoare recently sent a letter with gentle wording to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, everyone feels that Britain's attitude towards Italy has not changed at all. The Tribune published an unsigned article today, which is believed to have been written by Mussolini, stating that sanctions are not included in the League of Nations Covenant. Article 16 of the Covenant only mentions breaking off political and commercial relations. Fascist Italy has never borrowed a penny from foreign countries. Those who have never requested it have no reason to refuse it. The countries that advocate sanctions are those who want to sell goods to us more than buy from us. If they no longer want to trade with us, we will thank them, because the things that people then buy from others will only be limited to necessities. But if anyone wants to impose a blockade on Italy, this is actually a matter of war, and we will repay it with acts of war. (Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French people today stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had told French Ambassador to Italy Dichang Lun that "Things may sacrifice my position, or the lives of 100,000 people, or even my life, but Italy will move forward according to the plan for Abyssinia decided months ago." Most representatives participating in the League of Nations conference here initially doubted this statement, but gradually believed it. The League of Nations General Assembly decided to adjourn, not close, after completing its work today, amidst the welcome and rejection of Britain and Italy. It is said that this move will allow representatives of small countries who oppose Italian militarism to be convened at any time. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italians' attitude towards the League of Nations' obstruction of Italy's plan for Abyssinia has strengthened today. Reports say that Italy is still unmoved by the threat from Geneva. Prime Minister Mussolini will allow the Geneva reconciliation work to linger for a few days before withdrawing from the League of Nations or attacking Abyssinia. Therefore, the cabinet meeting on Saturday will not have any special decisions, but most Italians are secretly uneasy about Britain's firm attitude and feel that if Mussolini refuses to compromise, a war with Britain will occur, which is tantamount to "tragic suicide." (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A foreign spokesman predicted today that Italy would withdraw from the League of Nations, saying, "We are staying in Geneva only as a courtesy to its quasi-national status. We do not hope that the pro-Abyssinian faction that manipulates the League of Nations will resolve this dispute." (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is said that Italian representative Arosee originally planned to return to Rome today to report on the League of Nations' handling of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but because he received instructions from the government, he will temporarily remain in Geneva. Therefore, today's trip has been canceled. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The issue of Italy's food and raw material supply when the League of Nations implements economic sanctions is currently being studied by the relevant departments in charge. Official sources believe that countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations, such as Japan, Brazil, and Germany, can provide economic assistance to Italy, and it is said that Japan has expressed its willingness to supply food to Italy. Official sources are quite skeptical about whether economic sanctions can be truly implemented. For example, the Central Bank's exports to Italy last year reached 702,000,000 lira, while Italy's exports to Britain were only 530,000,000 lira. If British-Italian trade relations are severed, it is not Italy but Britain that will suffer losses. In addition, the government has taken all necessary steps to prevent a shortage of raw materials. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Italy has a sufficient supply of grain, even if foreign grain imports are stopped, it can still force the sale of grain at low prices.

<h3>Geneva People Observe: Italy Plans to Resolve the Issue Outside the League of Nations. War Will Not Break Out for the Time Being.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This party believes that the Italian government's statement in its communique that Italy does not want to take action before Geneva, which initially ignored its rights, actually contains the meaning that the Italian government is prepared to negotiate a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute outside the League of Nations. This also shows that the rumors outside are true that the Italian government will take certain steps to make Italy and Abyssinia reach a compromise. However, any compromise must of course be approved by the League of Nations, because Britain has firmly refused to join the three-party talks. The Italian government's statement that it will not withdraw from the League of Nations until the League of Nations implements sanctions is seen here as a sign that war will not break out for the time being. (Reuters Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Sea: British and Italian Defense Preparations; British Warship Sails from Hong Kong to Singapore</h3>
<p>Cairo: Alexandria, Egypt, is gradually taking on a wartime atmosphere. The British destroyers "Renault" and "Woodte" arrived yesterday. Multiple long-range guns have been installed at the port entrance, along with barbed wire to prevent submarine intrusions, leaving only a narrow channel for ship passage. Tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft, and ammunition are being unloaded ashore in a constant stream. The entire port resembles a military camp. One hundred seventy aircraft have arrived here in the past fifteen days. The components are currently being assembled and will be flown to the Abu Qir airfield west of Alexandria upon completion. The Undersecretary of the Army Department announced to the press that Egypt currently has 18,000 troops and no plans for reinforcements. (28th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Submarines "Bando Ler" and "Oscherler," under urgent orders, departed for Singapore at 9:30 PM tonight. The authorities have not disclosed the reason for this action. (28th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources in Athens, Greece, 1,500 Italian engineers are present on the island of Dodecanese within Greek territorial waters, constructing defense works under the protection of numerous destroyers. The Italians are also establishing submarine, torpedo boat, and air force bases on the island of Kalymnos. (28th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Suez Canal Company formally denied today the claim that the issue of closing the Suez Canal would be included on the agenda of the regular board meeting on October 7th. Furthermore, the suggestion that the company intended to consult legal experts on the issue of closing the canal in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute was also denied. It is said that the 1888 Treaty of Constantinople already stipulates that the Suez Canal, in times of peace or war, shall be free and open to merchant ships and warships of all nationalities, so there is no need to consult legal experts.

<h3>Abyssinia: Celebrating the End of the Rainy Season; People Dance Wildly in Torchlight</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The grand religious celebration marking the end of the rainy season, which began yesterday, continued throughout the night with crowds dancing and reveling in the light of countless torches. No unexpected incidents occurred. The authorities have declared a holiday for Italian nationals until the end of the week. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Today is the Feast of Maskal. Over ten thousand troops in the capital were personally reviewed by the Emperor for two and a half hours. Church leaders, royalty, dignitaries, and all foreign delegations attended the ceremony, which was extremely grand. The Feast of Maskal is the most important religious national holiday in Abyssinia. Every year, it often falls during the rainy season, but today the sky was uniquely free of rain. The Abyssinian people found it strange, believing it might be Heaven's desire for war, hastening the end of both seasons. If so, then the disaster of war could hardly be delayed any longer. The grandeur of today's military parade was unprecedented, intended to demonstrate Abyssinia's strength to resist Italian aggression. Some of the reviewed troops were new-style units trained by European military officers, while others were medieval warriors led by tribal chiefs, wearing gold and silver uniforms, carrying lion sashes, riding donkeys, and wielding spears and shields. There were also military academy students, cavalry, and guards, all newly trained. Boy Scouts led the way in vehicles. Despite poor weather, two aircraft flew over the troops. Spectators on both sides of the road cheered loudly with great enthusiasm. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: All of Abyssinia celebrated the end of the rainy season today. A sudden downpour from the heavens was considered an auspicious sign, predicting victory in the war against Italy. Today's large-scale parade in Addis Ababa was full of curiosities. First came the well-trained Imperial Guard and the army of Matafa, followed by donkey-riding chairmen, with their followers dancing wildly. Italian Minister Vinci also craned his neck to watch. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Djibouti: In the past few days, military supplies have been continuously transported from Addis Ababa to the front lines, casting great doubt on the claim that Abyssinia lacks arms. Furthermore, this indicates that the war will likely be prolonged. The French authorities here anticipate that the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway will be bombed at the start of hostilities, so they are currently preparing an emergency plan to protect the railway. It is noted that when Abyssinia granted rights to France, the treaty stipulated that if the railway is out of service for four months, it would be returned to Abyssinia.

<h3>Hungary Negotiates with Germany to Establish a Central European Bloc; Romanian King to Marry German Duchess?</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It is reported that Hungary and Germany are currently engaged in diplomatic negotiations, with the aim of establishing a new Central European political bloc, including Germany, Hungary, and possibly Poland, to counter the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente. The signing of a treaty between Hungary and Germany is apparently under consideration. Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös is currently hunting with Prussian Prime Minister Göring in East Prussia. However, two other senior Hungarian officials, Baron Bessenyey, the Director of Foreign Affairs, and Mangersch, the Director of Intelligence, are in Berlin holding talks with German government leaders to prepare for Gömbös's meeting with Hitler this Sunday. Furthermore, German Undersecretary of Aviation General Milch is also in the Hungarian capital, presumably in connection with the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany and Hungary.

<p>(Rome) A surprising rumor circulated here today that Romanian King Carol will marry a certain German duchess. It is said that Prince Hohenlohe is currently in Romania trying to persuade the King to form this marriage. However, officials associated with the court described the rumor as a dangerous political strategy, citing the meeting between General Göring and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös as evidence, as they are extremely wary of the recent rapprochement between Russia and Italy. It is noted that the Romanian Queen was originally the daughter of the late Greek King Constantine. The Queen divorced the King in 1928 due to his intimacy with Madame Lupescu.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Italian Front</h3>
<p>(From a War Correspondent with the Italian Army on the Abyssinian Front)</p>
<p>Large contingents of Italian troops with modern equipment are waiting quietly for Prime Minister Mussolini's order to attack. Part of the Italian army is now concentrated on the Eritrean border, south of which are towering mountains, reaching 11,000 feet, with rugged and impassable deep valleys, and then there is the "Danakil Depression," a "hellhole" and one of the most savage corners of the world, 200 feet below sea level, with temperatures reaching 162 degrees. It is inhabited entirely by savages who can start fires by rubbing wood together and kill strangers on sight. To the south, in Italian Somaliland, General Magliani's troops are stationed, facing the Ogaden province, hundreds of miles of wilderness devoid of water and grass. 200,000 Italian soldiers wear helmets and goggles to protect themselves from the deadly sunlight. An Associated Press reporter flying from Egypt to the Italian front discovered why Egypt is so concerned about the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Egypt is only a long, rectangular fertile land along the Nile River, flanked by hundreds of miles of desert. Therefore, the country that controls the upper reaches of the Nile can control the life source of millions of Egyptians. Since the Blue Nile originates in Abyssinia, the crux of the situation is evident. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Liu Chongjie, the Chinese Minister to Germany, will be transferred to Austria. He is scheduled to leave at the end of October. The German Chinese Society held a banquet for Minister Liu tonight. During the banquet, General Leizmann, the president of the society, delivered a speech, repeatedly praising Minister Liu's achievements, saying, "There is no conflict between China and Germany. German industry and capital are now participating in assisting China's reconstruction and industrialization, and the relationship is particularly close as German officers assist in reorganizing the Chinese army." In his reply, Minister Liu said, "China and Germany have been cooperating on cultural and economic matters on a completely equal footing for over a decade. German goods imported into China reach approximately 70 million taels annually, ranking third among countries exporting to China. However, since Germany implemented its new policies, some restrictions have been placed on the import of Chinese goods, which is unfortunate. Therefore, I hope that Germany can provide greater convenience to Chinese goods in the future." It is reported that after handing over his duties, Minister Liu plans to stay in Europe for several months before returning to China, and will take the opportunity to visit the Krupp factory in Essen.

<h3>Soviet Explorer Dies</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The famous Soviet explorer of Central Asia, researcher Kozlov, passed away yesterday in Leningrad at the age of seventy-two. Kozlov was world-renowned for discovering the dead cities of Khara-Khoto and Dujiang. This year, he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his scientific work. In 1907, he embarked on his fifteenth expedition to the Gobi Desert, which was completed in 1909, leading to the discovery of the dead city. In 1923, he led a Mongolian expedition organized by the Geographical Society to study the local natural and human environment. He began keeping a diary from the age of twenty and never stopped. This diary is extremely useful for explorers. His home in Leningrad was a small museum, reflecting the life of a Central Asian explorer. His contributions to geography were significant. Kozlov published numerous scientific works, documenting the travels of teachers and instructors, as well as Kozlov's own travel experiences. (27th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Income and Expenditure of Soviet Collective Farms</h3>
<p>(TASS News Agency, Moscow, September 7) The Soviet collectivization movement began five years ago. Currently, 80% of the country's farmers have joined collective farms. The income and expenditure situation of collective farms is very different from that of farmers before the revolution and individual farmers today. Collective farmers do not have to pay land prices, while in 1912, this expenditure accounted for 11% of the monetary expenses of farmers in old Russia. In 1934, the taxes paid by collective farmers to the state accounted for only 5% of the total budget, while before the revolution, it accounted for 20%. Individual farmers today also do not have to pay land prices, and their tax burden has also been greatly reduced. In the past year, the state invested approximately 2 billion rubles in machinery and tractor stations, providing collective farmers with more means of production. As a result, the budgets of collective farmers have changed significantly. In 1925, the cost of means of production for individual farmers in Moscow Province accounted for 14.5% of total expenditure. In 1934, this expenditure for collective farmers accounted for only 1% of monetary expenditure. This shows that because the means of production are collectively owned, 12% to 14% of monetary income can be used to meet cultural and other needs. The Soviet government has greatly increased cultural and medical expenses for collective farmers. In 1912, the average education and medical expenses for farmers were 6 kopecks per person, but in 1933, it was 23 rubles. In 1934-1935, this expenditure further increased significantly. There were no nurseries in the countryside in 1913. This year, 535,000 rural children are being raised in nurseries. The income and expenditure of collective farmers is constantly increasing. The amount of agricultural products they accumulate and sell to the market is also expanding. In 1934, the volume of trade in collective farms reached as much as 14 billion rubles. The increase in per capita food consumption of collective farmers from 1933 to 1934 is also sufficient to indicate the improvement in the welfare of collective farmers. Within a year, the consumption of bread and flour increased by 13%, grains by 46%, milk by 17%, butter by 71%, and sugar and confectionery by 69%. Soviet collective farmers are moving towards a prosperous and cultured life.</p>

<h3>Recent Overseas News</h3>
<p>— (Translated by Qu Shifan)</p>
<p>Comparison of Black and White Power</p>
<p>The most popular medical journal in Germany, a leader among medical publications worldwide, often contains records of new scientific discoveries. Its influence is sufficient to sway the trends in the medical field. Recently, it published a highly valuable paper, a report written by Dr. Samanx, which has attracted great attention in the European medical community. Dr. Samanx collected 219 of the most famous specialized medicines for treating gonorrhea from various countries around the world, including raw materials, finished medicines, injectable solutions, and special new drugs. Dr. Samanx wanted to use proven methods to select the fastest and most complete one, and conduct various studies on it. His experimental methods were quite commendable. Dr. Samanx hired several well-known medical doctors and physicians with rich knowledge as assistants and opened a grand trial. Dr. Samanx took 219 healthy white mice of the same type, numbered them in order, and transplanted gonococcal bacteria into their urinary tracts. Eight hours later, these 219 white mice suffered from the same gonorrhea. Dr. Samanx then ordered his assistants to use these 219 medicines to treat them separately. Dr. Samanx waited quietly to hear the reports from his assistants. The first to submit a report was Dr. Hoxonm, who was in charge of mouse number 81. Dr. Hoxonm said that mouse number 81, when fed a black LODELEN (translator's note: i.e., German Lodelan), experienced a rapid and effective elimination of the gonorrhea bacteria. Now, there is no trace of gonorrhea bacteria on the mouse's body. After LODELEN (Lodelan) is dissolved in the stomach, it does not exert its medicinal power until it reaches the intestine, where it dissolves and is absorbed by the intestinal wall into the bladder. It becomes a medicinal urine containing medicinal power, which penetrates the mucous membranes of the bladder, the anterior and posterior parts of the urethra, and the various parts of the urinary and reproductive organs, completely eliminating all gonorrhea bacteria. All dead bacteria in the body are excreted with the medicinal urine.</p>
<p>Miracle Under the Microscope</p>
<p>Dr. Samanx took the urine excreted by mouse number 81 in the test tube presented by Dr. Hoxonm and examined it under a microscope. As reported, subsequent reports were submitted 43 times, but none achieved rapid results and had various shortcomings. Dr. Samanx then ordered these 44 medicines to be dissolved into liquid and inoculated with gonorrhea bacteria. He ordered each assistant to examine the bactericidal state under a microscope, while Dr. Samanx personally tested LODELEN (Lodelan). As a result, there were 28 that could not achieve bactericidal effect within two hours, and only seven were the fastest. LODELEN (Lodelan), personally tested by Dr. Samanx, was the first to take effect. In the remaining six, gonorrhea bacteria could still put up considerable resistance in the liquid until 50 minutes later, when the gonorrhea bacteria gradually showed signs of decline. Dr. Samanx personally saw the gonorrhea bacteria in the LODELEN (Lodelan) liquid die without being able to struggle for even ten minutes.</p>
<p>Strange State of Activity Behind the Mucous Membrane</p>
<p>After Dr. Samanx discovered the special medicine LODELEN (Lodelan) for treating gonorrhea, he was not satisfied and wanted to explore its pharmacology. He took a white mouse infected with gonorrhea bacteria, dissected a portion of its mucous membrane, and divided it into 16 small pieces. He took the 16 medicines that could achieve bactericidal effect within two hours and applied them to one side of the mucous membrane. Under the microscope, it was found that only one medicine could completely kill the gonorrhea bacteria on both sides of the mucous membrane, which was LODELEN (Lodelan). Three other medicines showed signs of gradual penetration only after one hour. At this time, the gonorrhea bacteria were able to escape to the part of the mucous membrane where the medicinal power had not yet reached. The reproduction rate of gonorrhea bacteria is very fast. As a result, the gonorrhea bacteria behind the mucous membrane were not only not eliminated, but also multiplied. Therefore, only LODELEN (Lodelan), when used in China, even if gonorrhea bacteria have penetrated deep into the mucous membrane, and the diluted solution is tested, can achieve the same effect. Dr. Samanx considered this to be extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Real Experiment in the Hospital</p>
<p>Since Dr. Samanx published his report, various hospitals have competed to conduct various experiments. Patients were treated with either the old medicines they were used to, or with LODELEN (Lodelan), and a comparative statistic was made. It was found that LODELEN (Lodelan) could achieve rapid cures for severe gonorrhea, which was previously considered difficult to cure quickly, equivalent to treating mild gonorrhea with the old medicines. LODELEN (Lodelan) treats mild or newly infected gonorrhea, and its speed far exceeds that of old medicines, unparalleled. Take the urine of patients to test it, and the color of the urine turns blue, containing a large number of dead bacteria that have been killed and excreted. Take the urine for a second test, and the turbidity gradually decreases. After about six or seven times, the urine color becomes clear, indicating that the gonorrhea bacteria have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Various Methods and Advantages and Disadvantages of Treating Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Afterwards, medical journals discussed the treatment of gonorrhea, and Dr. Dumeibao severely criticized the various old methods of treating gonorrhea in the past. His aphorisms include:</p>
<p>(Washing method) ... This is the most unreasonable treatment. When the medicine is injected, the gonorrhea bacteria flow and penetrate into the posterior part of the urethra, and it is even more difficult to search and eliminate them in the concave and slender tubes. It is like inviting gonorrhea bacteria into the house...</p>
<p>(Electrotherapy) ... This method is also difficult to avoid being criticized as clumsy due to its many drawbacks. Why? Because it does not understand the principle of avoiding hitting the object when throwing at a rat... If the current used is weak, it only gives the gonorrhea bacteria a warm and comfortable temperature, helping them to grow, reproduce, and be rampant. If the current used is too strong, it will not only cause burning pain on the skin, but it will also be difficult to reach the delicate tissues such as the testicles and seminal vesicles, and it cannot kill the gonorrhea bacteria lurking behind the nearby mucous membranes. Otherwise, if the power is too strong, the gonorrhea bacteria and sperm will be destroyed together, which will affect future generations...</p>
<p>(Injection method) ... This method has many shortcomings. After the injection, it travels throughout the body with the bloodstream, and the power is weakened. Other parts of the body are directly stimulated by this medicine, causing various side effects...</p>
<p>(Oral administration) ... In the past, the concerns about this method were: first, that it would dissolve in the stomach immediately and cause a chemical reaction with the gastric juice, changing the medicinal power and causing harm to the stomach meridian; second, that the medicinal power could not penetrate the membrane and only do superficial work, without being able to achieve full efficacy; third, that it would cause the same attack on delicate reproductive tissues, which is very important for future generations. Since Dr. Samanx published the LODELEN (Lodelan) treatment method, I have conducted various experiments and found that there are no above-mentioned drawbacks, and it is indeed foolproof in every way.</p>
<p>LODELEN (Lodelan), Which Was Extremely Popular in Germany</p>
<p>After medical journals discussed the treatment of gonorrhea in detail and published the only special medicine LODELEN (Lodelan) for treating gonorrhea, experimenters and reporters emerged one after another. LODELEN (Lodelan) was praised in every way and became extremely popular for a time. The German Dussche Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory worked day and night to produce it, and it was so busy that it could not keep up. Countries in the East and West also prepared large quantities of LODELEN (Lodelan) to meet the needs of hospitals for treatment and patients for radical cure of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Great Movement to Eradicate Gonorrhea</p>
<p>After Dr. Samanx discovered the special medicine LODELEN (Lodelan) for rapidly curing gonorrhea, a temporary joint committee of physicians had an amazing plan to use various methods to let the public know the shortcut to treatment and to take LODELEN (Lodelan) immediately for treatment, so that there would be no single gonorrhea bacterium in Germany, except in the glass tubes in the chemical laboratory of the hospital.</p>
<p>LODELEN (Lodelan) in China</p>
<p>The efficacy of LODELEN (Lodelan) shocked the world after the German medical journal published Dr. Samanx's experimental report. However, the drug was not a new product when first introduced, but after Dr. Samanx's experiment, it was confirmed to have a magnificent effect. LODELEN (Lodelan) has a glorious history of more than 50 years in global sales, and has cured no less than tens of millions of patients. After Dr. Samanx's experiment, patients can better understand its pharmacology and increase its credibility, so its popularity today is natural. Therefore, major pharmacies in China have it in stock at all times to meet the needs of patients. In the future, they may go a step further and initiate a great movement to eradicate gonorrhea following Germany.</p>
<p>The Great Effect of LODELEN (Lodelan)</p>
<p>Translator's note: German LODELEN (Lodelan) is a brown pill, and its ingredients are extremely precious. It is encapsulated with a special method, swallowed into the stomach, and melts immediately, but its medicinal power only dissolves in the intestine, is absorbed by the intestinal wall, and reaches the bladder directly to exert its function of eliminating gonorrhea bacteria. On the one hand, its pharmacology can penetrate the mucous membranes of the urinary organs, killing the gonorrhea bacteria hidden in them. On the other hand, its medicinal power turns into medicinal urine in the urine, which can eliminate all gonorrhea bacteria passing through the medicinal urine and excrete them from the body with the urine. In addition to killing bacteria through the membrane, it also has diuretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-swelling, pain-relieving, antiseptic, and regenerative effects, allowing patients to sweep away the pain they have suffered in the past and obtain various comforts, and can restore their original healthy state in the shortest period, which is very different from fine washing, electrotherapy, injection, and all inferior medicines. If any of our compatriots suffer from it, they should quickly buy and take it for treatment, and not continue to sink into the sea of suffering and sacrifice their health and happiness.</p>

<p>Chicago Wheat: The domestic wheat market is strong, and the new buying trend continues. Therefore, the opening price of the Chicago wheat market rose slightly.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Urges Shanghai Money Shops to Repay Financial Bonds</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) To rescue Shanghai money shops, 25 million yuan of financial bonds issued in the Republic of China Year 24 were allocated to facilitate regulation, and a money shop supervisory committee was organized to handle the matter. Each shop provided collateral, which was deposited with the supervisory committee as security. The Ministry of Finance believes that these bonds have been outstanding for several months, and has ordered the Money Shop Association to instruct each shop to repay the full amount and redeem its collateral, so that these 25 million yuan of bonds can be used for other important purposes. According to a senior official of the Ministry of Finance, after the Ministry issued the order to urge repayment, a few money shops have already returned the full amount to the supervisory committee and redeemed their collateral. Those shops that have not yet repaid will be urged to do so again. After the bonds are recovered, they will be used for productive construction. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Victory in the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression; Remnants Retreat to Western Highlands</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: After military encirclement and suppression, the remaining bandits in various areas have dwindled in number and their strength has been reduced by more than half. They can now be divided into four groups: One group, led by Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Xu Xiangqian, is roaming the border areas of Sichuan and Gansu. Another group, led by Liu Zidan and Xu Haidong, is entrenched in northern Shaanxi. A third group, led by He Long and Xiao Ke, is harassing western Hunan. The last group, led by Gao Junting, is roaming the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. Among these, the Gao bandit group is the weakest and can be easily annihilated. The bandits in Sichuan and Shaanxi are also surrounded. Zhang Xueliang, the director of the campaign headquarters, has gone to Shaanxi and Gansu to oversee the suppression. He Chengjun, the pacification commissioner, originally stationed in Yichang, returned to Hankou on the 25th to handle important official matters and departed for Shashi by plane on the 27th.</p>
<p>Regarding the bandit suppression in western Hunan, since the death in battle of Xie Bin, the commander of the 85th Division, the national army has been winning successive victories. In late August, the Feng troops of the 27th Division, stationed in western Hubei, launched an attack from Gong'an. Coincidentally, the He bandits were leading their forces eastward. On the 31st, they encountered each other at Tianjiapu and Pengjiachang in Libei, Hunan. The Yan troops of the 80th Brigade of the national army occupied the high ground to fight. The bandits formed dense columns and launched fierce assaults on the national army positions from several directions. Brigade Commander Yan bared his arms and shouted encouragement, greatly boosting morale. After a fierce battle, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. When the bandits attacked again, national army reinforcements arrived and counterattacked. From dawn to dusk, the bandits were finally defeated. In this battle, 17 bandit regimental, battalion, and company commanders were killed, along with more than 700 bandits. Bandit Division Commander Xia and Political Commissar Wang were both seriously injured, and many bandits were captured. The remaining bandits retreated to the high ground to defend it. On September 2nd, Brigade Commander Yan again sent an elite battalion to attack the high ground of Pengjiachang to assess the bandits' strength. The bandits came out to meet the attack in two directions but were again defeated by the national army. The bandits retreated to the Chenjiadang and Cheshan areas. In the Qingnitan area, the bandits added about two regiments and will join forces to fight to the death. Brigade Commander Huang of the 79th Brigade immediately selected 100 elite soldiers and two assault teams to launch a surprise attack on the bandits at 3 a.m. on the 11th. The national army stationed at Futian Temple responded by attacking. The bandits were awakened from their dreams and scattered in disarray. It is estimated that nine bandit battalion and company commanders were captured alive, and many bandits were killed. The remaining bandits have now retreated to the western highlands, where they are running out of food and ammunition, and it should not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. (27th)</p>
<h3>General Mobilization of the People of Hubei Province to Serve in Repairing Dikes; Provincial Government Forms Labor Service Committee; Hankou City Focuses on Various Water Conservancy Projects</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: This year's floods in Hubei Province have caused the collapse of dikes. The repair project is huge. It was initially decided that the river dikes would be repaired by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and 4.6 million yuan would be used for civil dikes in exchange for labor. However, it is still feared that they will not be completely repaired. Recently, Chairman Chiang issued an order to all provinces to implement labor service and stipulated that November 1st should be the beginning of the season for water conservancy service. The provincial government then proposed the idea of ​​conscripting labor to repair dikes. The Ministry of Civil Affairs and Construction was instructed to draft implementation measures, and it was decided to establish a National Labor Service Committee to take charge of the matter. On the 27th, the provincial government meeting approved the organizational regulations of the committee, which will have 10 members, with Zhang Rang as the chairman, to guide the work. It was decided to implement the plan on November 1st and complete it by March 31st next year. In addition to repairing dikes, other undertakings related to road construction, afforestation, reclamation, and water conservancy are also included.</p>
<p>In Hankou, because it is a market, the situation is slightly different from other counties. On the 27th, the municipal government convened a meeting of representatives from the Public Security Bureau, various branch bureaus, district farmers' associations, and security branch associations to determine 10 implementation procedures: (1) This procedure is formulated in accordance with the Hubei Provincial People's Labor Service Regulations, the Hankou Municipal People's Labor Service Implementation Rules, and the telegram issued by Chairman Chiang from Rongzhi. (2) According to the provisions of Article 3 of the detailed rules, this city is divided into agricultural and commercial areas. From the Jinluji Bi Yang Road, straight along the railway line to Qiaokou, and south to the river, is the commercial area; the rest is the agricultural area. (3) The labor service period for the agricultural area is from November 1st of this year to January 31st of next year; the labor service period for the commercial area is from February 1st to April 31st of next year. (4) The number of people performing labor service and the roster of able-bodied men will be investigated and reported by the public security branch bureaus. The agricultural area is limited to before October 10th, and the commercial area is limited to before November 10th. The roster will be sent to the Public Security Bureau and then submitted to the municipal government. The personnel from the military and central government agencies directly under the jurisdiction will be requested to report to the campaign headquarters and the provincial government, which will forward them to the Hankou military commanders and the relevant agencies, who will directly lead them to the work site, listen to the command of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and notify the municipal government of the number of people in writing. The number of people in the political and academic circles will be investigated by the municipal government's subordinate agencies, and the roster will be submitted to the municipal government before October 10th. The age of civil servants for labor service shall be determined in accordance with the Hubei Provincial People's Labor Service Regulations, from 18 to 45 years old. (5) There are about 20,000 able-bodied men in the agricultural area and about 180,000 able-bodied men in the commercial area. Each person will perform labor service for five days. The agricultural area can provide 100,000 man-days of labor, and the commercial area can provide 900,000 man-days of labor. The agricultural area will send 2,000 workers per day, and the commercial area will send 20,000 workers per day. It is estimated that it can be completed in about 50 sunny days. Because it is feared that rain and snow will delay the work, the second article is limited to three months. (6) The projects to be done in the agricultural area are Linghu opening the port and building roads. It cannot be completed this year and will continue to be handled next year. The projects to be done in the commercial area are filling the water trenches on both sides of Zhongshan Road (100,000 man-days) and repairing dikes (800,000 man-days). However, the people serving in Changfeng North and South Dikes and Huanghezhou can specially repair the civil dikes in their respective areas. Military, political, and academic personnel will also be responsible for dike repair work. (7) For the above-mentioned projects, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau is requested to send engineering personnel to guide them. Regarding the port opening, road construction, and water trench filling projects, the municipal government will send engineering personnel to guide them. (8) The recruitment of labor in the agricultural area will be handled by the public security branch bureaus in conjunction with the farmers' associations. Those who are in the First and Second District Water Conservancy Committee and various civil defense offices will also be handled in conjunction with the competent water conservancy committees and defense offices. The recruitment of labor in the commercial area will be handled by the public security branch bureaus in conjunction with the security public welfare associations. Military, political, and academic circles will be handled directly by their respective agencies. (9) During the labor service period, please ask the police headquarters to send troops to be stationed in various work areas to maintain order. (10) Regarding the tools used during work, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau will purchase and distribute those belonging to the dike repair part, and the municipal government will purchase and distribute those belonging to the port opening, road construction, and water trench filling parts. All will be handed over to the public security branch bureaus in conjunction with the farmers' associations and security public welfare associations for receipt and distribution in the morning and evening collection every day. Security teams will be sent to guard them, and they are not allowed to be taken home to avoid loss. (27th)</p>
<h3>Shantou Smuggling Problem; Japanese Side Proposes Three Conditions; Situation Gradually Becomes Serious</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The current political and economic organization in Shantou is slightly different from other places. For all imported goods, such as foreign rice, oil, beans, bean cakes, foreign paper, old newspapers, seafood, groceries, cloth, rayon, and all domestic and foreign goods, in addition to the regular customs duties, there are also special taxes. As for white sugar, cement, nitric acid, fertilizer, and other goods, they are under the exclusive control of the Provincial State-Owned Products Management Office through monopoly methods. Various items are burdened with excessive taxes and are expensive. Most merchants have suspended business. Japanese merchants and foreign firms took the opportunity to handle large quantities of rice, beans, and bean cakes to Shantou for dumping. Because they do not pay taxes, their prices are cheap. Not only is the government's tax revenue greatly affected, but other businesses' imported goods are also unsalable, making it difficult for them to sustain themselves. Various trade associations have repeatedly telegraphed the government, requesting relief, some requesting a temporary suspension of special taxes, and some requesting a refund of taxes for the original goods exported, but all were denied. As a result, the momentum of foreign merchants importing goods has become more fierce. It is said that the Eastern District Commissioner's Office has decided to strictly crack down on smuggling, and has issued documents to various counties to be enforced by the military, political, and police authorities. On the 11th of this month, a large amount of smuggled rice that had not paid taxes was seized in Jieyang City, and a boat of smuggled rice, about 100 bags, was also seized in Beixi. County Magistrate Huang then summoned the boatmen and merchants for a lecture. Unexpectedly, shortly after, Japanese commercial firms in Shantou suddenly sent people to Jieyang to negotiate and eventually released the rice and the boat. At the same time, seven Japanese warships suddenly sailed to Shantou and berthed near the Japanese Consulate, and put forward three conditions: (1) Compensation for the loss of the detention; (2) A guarantee that no similar incidents will occur in the future; (3) Announce to all counties the protection of trade and no obstruction of the goods being transported. Because Eastern District Commissioner Li Hanhun had not yet arrived in Shantou to take over, Mayor Li Yuanhe was not in a position to reply and went to the province for instructions. The Japanese warships have not left Shantou because our side has not responded. The current situation is extremely serious. Also, at about 3 p.m. on the 20th, inspectors from the Provincial State-Owned Products Management Branch Office seized smuggled sugar on a lighter in Wuqiao. The Taiwanese on the lighter beat the inspectors. The inspectors finally seized 40 bags of smuggled sugar and made a scene at the Third Branch Bureau. According to the confession of Taiwanese Li Liao, who lives in the Nanshunfa Commercial Firm, he bought 300 catties of white sugar from the customs and urged the boat to transport it to Chao'an to be sold to the Guanghua Foreign Firm. Seven or eight inspectors beat him and took away 40 bags of white sugar, etc. This beating has caused a dispute. It is said that Gan Jiehou will come to Shantou from Guangzhou to contact the Japanese Consul to resolve the case as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Trip to the South</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>(42) Scenic Spots and Historical Sites of Guilin</p>
<p>Since Guilin lost its position as the political center after the provincial capital moved, its economy and commerce have declined day by day, and more old aristocratic families have declined. People's livelihoods are particularly difficult. In recent years, the Guizhou provincial authorities have been determined to carry out construction. Liu Guilin has set up a municipal office in the cultural and tourist area to build wide roads, and the city appearance has been completely renewed. In terms of transportation, the right bank of the waterway flows into the county from the northeast, passes through Yangshuo, Pingdong, and Zhaoping, connects to the Fu River, joins the Da River at Wuzhou, flows into the Xijiang River, and is passable for civilian ships carrying 40,000 to 50,000 catties. In addition, there is the Twenty-Ye River, which flows into the Guijiang River from the west and can also be used by civilian ships carrying 40,000 to 50,000 catties. As for the provincial highways that have been opened, there are the Guiquan Road, which passes through Lingchuan and Xing'an and reaches the whole county, with a length of 265 li; the Guiliu Road, which passes through Yangshuo, Lipu, and Liujiang and reaches Liuzhou, with a length of 540 li; and the Guiyong Road, which passes through Liangjiang and Liqiao and reaches Yongfu, with a length of 110 li. The Guihai Road is still under construction. In recent years, Chinese and foreign people have been shocked by the reputation of Guilin's landscape as the best in the world. Those who have traveled here one after another have been endless, but in the end, the inconvenience of transportation and the speed of the waterway journey have to be viewed as the rise and fall of the water, which has greatly reduced the interest of tourists. In the future, when the Guizhou provincial transportation network is completed, it will not be difficult for Guilin to rival Beijing and Hangzhou. Guilin has beautiful mountains and clear waters, and the scenery is completely natural. It has not been artificially constructed. It cannot be compared with the famous scenic spots in Beijing and Hangzhou, which are half-borrowed from artificiality. Moreover, since Guilin and Xiangjun were established in the Qin Dynasty, it has been an important southern town for generations, and there are many historical sites. Fan Chengda, a Souther Song Dynasty person, commented on the characteristics of Guilin Mountain: First, all the peaks rise from the local area, standing alone, like jade shoots and yao ginseng, densely arranged without limit. Second, the mountains are all hollow in the middle, so there are many good caves under the peaks. Therefore, I commented that the wonder of Guilin Mountain should be the first in the world. The value of Guilin Mountain can be seen in general. Guilin is surrounded by mountains. In addition, along the banks of the Tanjiang River, there are many dangerous gorges and streams, which are eye-catching and cannot be explored. The famous peaks include Duxiu Peak, which stands alone in the city, Fengdong Mountain in the northeast of the city, Qixing Mountain in the east of the city, Baohua Mountain in the northwest of the city, Yushan in the north of the city, Fubo Mountain on the northeast city wall, Wolong Mountain facing Shihua Mountain, Tishan outside the southeast city, and Yaoshan, which is across the river from Shundong. The others include Douchi Mountain, Zhishan, Jingping Mountain, Hou Mountain, and Elephant Trunk Hill, which are shaped like elephants. Guilin is close to Changsha, so all the languages ​​and customs are quite similar to those of Hunan Province. The reporter traveled to the southwest and did not understand Cantonese. Along the way, he used a pen instead of a mouth, or asked for temporary translation, or used English. All kinds of inconveniences were very painful. After arriving in Guilin, it was like returning to his hometown. After being dumb for twenty days, he suddenly recovered and spoke freely, feeling refreshed and a hundred times more interested. Moreover, Guilin is close to the temperate zone and the climate is relatively cool. From Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Wuzhou, Nanning, Longzhou, and Liuzhou, the continental climate of sweating like rain was relieved at once, and I felt even more excited. On the 21st, I got up at dawn and, led by the receptionist, spent the whole day visiting the scenic spots and historical sites of Guilin, taking a quick look and only getting a general idea, failing to fully enjoy the beauty. It was a great pity. First, I went to Duxiu Peak, also known as Zijin Mountain. Duxiu Peak stands alone in the city, in the Ming Dynasty Jingjiang Palace, because it enjoys a great reputation. Now the palace has been changed to Zhongshan Park, and the garden surrounds the bottom of the peak. There are many tourists gathered. Duxiu Peak is no more than a hundred feet high and is the smallest of the Guilin peaks. There are only 360 steps from the foot of the mountain to the top, and temples and pavilions dot the mountain scenery, providing a place to rest. Climbing to the peak and overlooking the entire city, the fields, mountains, and rivers are all in sight. At the foot of the mountain, there is a pond called Crescent Moon Pond, and a cave called Reading Rock. Yan Yanzhi read books in it when he was guarding the county in the Song Dynasty. There is Taiping Rock on the west side of the mountain, with a stone engraving of Liu Haichan drawn by Ming Gonghui King. There is a snow cave on the west side of the mountain, with stalactites hanging from the stone wall, as white as snow. Then I left the park and walked for several miles to Guishan. The mountain is located in the northeast corner of the city, with three peaks connected, one after the other, winding and winding. It is said that there are many sweet osmanthus trees on the mountain, hence the name Guishan. There is Diecai Rock on the east side of the mountain. Climbing up the stone steps, you can see all the scenes in a week. Entering the gate, there is a monument temple where the two public benefactors of Dangshu Qu Zhongshi Jiangling Zhang Zhonglie died for righteousness. Liang Juzi, the envoy of Fuyue in the Gengzi year of Daoguang, erected a stone and wrote a couplet by Qing official Zhu Tingliang, "Die Sui Huan Chong Temple, watching this day, Taiwan neighbors Zhuge, Mountain facing Fubo, still the territory of the Han family, wearing Dan and supporting the orthodoxy, tracing back to that year, Depei Su Lord, the heart hanging also the Emperor, no shame Lu Shi Chunqiu." In the environment at that time, this can be said to be a bold right turn to Qingfeng Pavilion. Tang Yuan Changshi Hui built a pavilion here. Later, the stone cave was the North Window, overlooking the river, like a painting. It was midsummer, and I was exhausted from climbing the mountain and sweating profusely. At this time, a cool breeze blew from behind the mountain, and the heat disappeared completely, making my heart refreshed. Therefore, it is also known as Fengdong Mountain. Leaving the cave entrance is the Beiyun Building. The couplet says, "The cave overlooks the East River, and the wind announces the West Qiao." The writing is vigorous and powerful. Several vendors set up stalls selling groceries. When guests arrive, they immediately offer spring water to make tea, which is fragrant and delicious. Women sell water chestnuts produced in Guilin and also peel them for guests without asking for money. When guests give them a few cents, they thank them repeatedly. The customs and human feelings are very strong. It is not comparable to the cunning and extortion of the Jiangnan people. It was almost noon, so I returned to my residence for lunch. In the afternoon, I took a special trip to Liangfeng to visit the Liangfeng Garden. The garden was built by Tang Zishi at the end of the Qing Dynasty. His descendants gave it to Cen Xilin, so it is also called Xilin Park. Cen then returned it to the public, and now it is a public country. It is only forty li from the city. The mountains and rivers are all surrounded inside. It is said that the structure is modeled after the Grand View Garden in the Dream of the Red Chamber. Pavilions and pavilions are scattered like stars, bridges and flowing water, the ultimate beauty of the garden, like the Summer Palace in Beijing, but the natural scenery surpasses it. Recently, the Guilin authorities have designated a part of it as a teacher training school, which has been slightly renovated and is completely new. The reporter took a quick look and returned to the city, walking across the floating bridge to cross the Tanjiang River. The bridge is made up of 50 large civilian boats linked together, slightly like the French bridge in Ningbo, but wider. Not half a mile to Huabridge, the bridge is made of huge stones and has nine holes. It was built in the Ming Dynasty. The water under the bridge is very shallow and dry. Under the bridge is a market, and many working women draw water under the bridge. After walking about three miles, I arrived at Qixing Mountain. The seven peaks are arranged like the Big Dipper. First, I entered Qixia Temple. The scale is very dangerous. It is no longer the old site built in the Tang Dynasty. Going down, I arrived at the entrance of Qixing Rock Cave. Several Western women had already entered first. There were more than a dozen guides, all holding torches to wait. When guests arrived, they rushed to surround them and asked about the price, which was one yuan per torch. As a result, a transaction was made for half a yuan per torch, and I started to enter the cave. The torchbearers led left, right, front, and back. The cave was deep and dark, and it was difficult to walk because it was very humid and slippery in the midsummer. Fortunately, the authorities had sprinkled bran on the road in advance, and the center of gravity could be supported a little. The reporter and others held their breath and stared at the torchlight. The guides also spoke Japanese, like Shanghai's double reed comedy, and the words were rhyming. It said, "This is a dragon and a tiger, this is an elephant and a snake, this is the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, this is a boy worshiping Guanyin, this is a monk practicing Taoism, this is a bat chasing, this is Taigong fishing." It is completely a variety of shapes formed by stalactites, far-fetched, naive, and ridiculous. Proceeding in twists and turns like this, ascending and descending left and right, the sheep's intestines and crow path, looking down at the dark and bottomless, the hair stands on end. The temperature in the cave is about 70 degrees, and the yin wind is blowing. However, because I was exerting too much effort, I was panting and sweating non-stop. After walking for about 40 minutes, I suddenly saw a faint light, like the morning light on the first floor, illuminating the walls of the cave. The darkness was suddenly brightened, like being granted a great amnesty. After more than a hundred steps, the cave entrance was in sight, and I saw the sunlight for the first time. Leaving the cave, it was like another world. The heat attacked my clothes, and I felt the coolness of the yin wind in the cave more lovely. Then I went to the foot of the seventh peak of Qixing Mountain, the Longyi Rock, the cave entrance facing the river. Looking at the shallow water of the shoal in the distance, the villagers waded across, which was quite interesting. The water hit the sand and the cave was piled up very high. The cave was very spacious, about seven or eighty feet high, one hundred feet long, and twenty feet wide. There are traces of the same page, Tian Jiao is like a dragon, hence the name. There are many stone carvings and inscriptions outside the rock, including the inscription stele of the three generals of Di Qing and others, whose handwriting is well preserved. Several dozen steps west of Longyin Rock, there are many stone carvings and inscriptions on the mountain rock, among which the most famous is the Yuanyou Party Membership Stele. After Emperor Huizong issued an decree to destroy the stele in the fifth year of Song Chongning, there were no such steles anywhere. Now there are only two cliff carvings in Guangxi, one in Zhenxian Rock in Rong County and the other here. Walking north from Longyin Rock to Crescent Mountain, the mountain is not very high, and one peak of the mountain is steep and looks like a sword. It is called the Sword Mountain. Between the mountains, the stone cliff is wide and flat like a moon, so it is also called Crescent Mountain. There is a temple pavilion in the middle, and the old monk in the temple is good at making old tofu, which he obtained from a secret transmission. It is unusually delicious, but it must be ordered one day in advance. The reporter was suddenly unable to enjoy this delicacy. It was already sunset, so I hurriedly returned to my residence, packed my luggage, and made plans to return.</p>

<h3>Dangerous Situation of the Liutang River Embankment; Old and New Embankments Collapse, Laborers Retreat to Protect Chaimi River; More Than Fifty Villages Completely Submerged</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: Recently, since the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River and into the canal, Beiliutang has been in a precarious situation. Therefore, the county magistrates of Shudong and Guan counties gathered in Tanggou, the fifth district of Shuyang, and supervised more than 8,000 laborers from the three counties to repair the old embankment overnight. The situation is extremely serious. The reporter went to northern Jiangsu on business, passing through Shuxian, so he went to inspect the Liutang flood control project. The following is a record of what he saw and heard.</p>
<p>Yangjiatao in Shuyang is 70 li away from the city and belongs to the fifth district. Water transport directly reaches Xinpu in the east sea and is an important commercial town in the county. The reporter arrived in Tanggou at 2 p.m. on the 20th. Before the dust had settled, he suddenly heard gongs ringing everywhere, so he went into the street to investigate and saw that the laborers were gathered together. He learned that they were urging the laborers to rush to repair the dangerous work on the Zhoukou transverse embankment. When he went to the restaurant for a meal, he found that both cooked and uncooked food had been sold out. All the food had been bought by the workers, and even the waiters had gone to the work site to help with the flood control. Only the old and weak were left to guard the kitchen. The wood for the dyeing workshop's rice sheds and other materials were all dismantled and transported to the work site to cut stakes and rush to make grass dams to protect the new embankment. It is said that the Zhoukou dangerous work and the Zhoukou grass dam are located about half a li west of Tanggou and are a key point for the confluence of the Yi and Shu rivers. The whole work is nearly 50 zhang long, connecting the left and right banks of the Liutang remote embankment built last year. In July of this year, the people on both banks of the Chaimi River automatically raised more than 2,000 yuan to build a dike to prevent the confluence of the Yi River, which was completed under the supervision of Tang Puhan, a citizen of the second district of Donghai. Now the water level of Liutang is 1.8 meters higher than that of Chaimi. Without this dam to block it, if the Yi and Shu rivers were allowed to converge, then half of Haishu would definitely be flooded. As the saying goes, "The Yi and Shu rivers do not meet, but when they do, it is a vast expanse." One can imagine the situation.</p>
<p>After seeing the dangerous work, looking west from Zhoukou, the water and the sky are the same color, without end. It was found that the water came from the Chaimi River because the east bank of the Lanhe embankment in Taipingji, the ninth district, collapsed on the morning of the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, causing a flood. Fortunately, the people on the banks of the Liutang River rushed to build a small Lanhe weir, so it did not endanger the new embankment. However, more than 50 villages in the ninth district, including Taipingji, Taisi Village, Wang Temple, Liu Yard, Ge Wuzhuang, Ge Sizhuang, and Wei Village, have completely submerged underwater, and thousands of households have been displaced. As the sun sets in the west, smoke is intermittently rising from the silver waves, which is thought to be the place where the flood victims are gathering for meals. A section of the old embankment near Zhoukou collapsed to the south, and the water blocking the new embankment was serious. Later, after a meeting of the three counties of Shudong and Guan, it was decided to protect Qianwei and the old embankment in the area to avoid expanding the disaster area. The work was allocated, and it was decided that Guan would send 1,000 laborers to help repair the northern section of the new embankment, and Donghai would send 1,000 laborers to help Shuyang repair the old embankment. Unexpectedly, while the work was in progress, the old embankment on the left bank of Liutang on the opposite side of Zhou Ma, upstream of Qianwei in the ninth district, collapsed to the west. The proposal to protect the old was terminated. After the old embankment at Zhouma broke, the farmers rushed to block the weir gate, because the area is located on Shuangtan, and the water from the Zhouma break has flowed down. Farmers in the beach inside the new embankment are also rushing to move boxes, cabinets, food, and grain to store on the embankment. Women, children, the old and the weak rush to cut autumn beans and sweet potatoes, truly seizing every moment. By 3 p.m., the water from the breach had directly approached the new Zhoukou embankment. The residents of several thousand households in the area of ​​dozens of miles inside this beach had been completely submerged underwater. County Magistrate Deng used civilian boats to rescue the flood victims in the area of ​​Sanjiezhuang. When the reporter followed the boat to inspect, when the boat arrived, the flood victims climbed on the roofs and trees, shouting for help. The houses that had been flooded collapsed one after another, and three flood victims had been crushed to death under the walls while trying to take care of their belongings. There were dozens of lifeboats, but there were too many flood victims and they were not enough to use. Every time the rudder was started, the flood victims still shouted to stop the boat. The moment of life and death was truly a human tragedy.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m., more than 20 people, including the county magistrates of Dong, Shu, and Guan counties and engineers, inspected the flood control project on the new embankment. Unexpectedly, when they were walking north of Qianwei, the new embankment suddenly collapsed. In the initial intention of the county magistrates and others, they still planned to recruit laborers to block the embankment. However, in an instant, a few feet away from the newly opened breach, another place collapsed. The inspectors were cut off on the broken embankment. If they stayed for a moment, they would go with the water, so they fled for their lives, snatching the flow across the fields. As for the Shuyang Yellow River flood control project, Liutang is the key point, and no slack is allowed. However, Zhang Guorui, the Yellow River flood control commissioner of the ninth district, not only failed to protect the old embankment in the Qianwei area carefully, but also the new embankment was too low and did not accumulate soil, causing three sections to collapse in two hours. Now the Liutang project has become riddled with holes, wasting labor for two months, abandoning the important work at once, which is very regrettable. The county magistrates of Dong, Guan, and Shu believe that since the Liutang project has been abandoned, it is necessary to retreat to protect Chaimi to avoid expanding the disaster area. After discussion, Guan Xu retreated to the downstream and sent 3,000 laborers to Dongpingdun in the fifth district to help the county jointly protect Chaimi. County Magistrate Deng of Shu also went to Li Hengzhuang in the fifth district that night to repair the new Chaimi embankment overnight. Therefore, Tanggou sat on the cymbals and there was no one, and the gongs sounded several times in one night. The reporter returned to Shuyang on the 21st. When the boat passed Li Hengzhuang in the fifth district, he went to inspect the Chaimi River embankment. The river's flow suddenly increased due to the collapse of Liutang. The top of the embankment was one foot away from the water surface, floating on the water. The laborers along the embankment were rushing to protect it with sorghum stalks, tree trunks, and bean sprouts. However, the farmland outside the embankment was soaked by the embankments, and the dry soil had no support, so it was a piece of mud. Therefore, judging from the current state of the Chaimi embankment, the top is not strong, and the roots are loose. The amount of water is increasing every day. If the east wind helps the abuse, Haishu is in danger. (September 28th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi Prepare for Winter Defense; Various Counties in Guangdong Establish Joint Defense Associations; Inns and Hotels Assist in Maintaining Security</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have recently been actively preparing for winter defense. Various county and city governments in Guangdong province have separately convened local groups to discuss and establish winter defense regulations and organize joint defense committees. They are also setting up temporary merchant protection teams and strengthening local training. To prevent criminals from infiltrating Guangzhou city, given that most clubs within the city harbor filth and are of mixed quality, it is planned to eliminate improper facilities such as smoking and gambling from these clubs. Additionally, more detectives will be stationed at public entertainment venues to investigate suspicious individuals at all times. Wuzhou in Guangxi province, being the gateway between Guangdong and Guangxi and a major commercial port in Guangxi, holds a vital strategic position. The Wuzhou Public Security Bureau, to maintain order, recently convened a meeting of representatives from various hotels in the city to discuss ways to assist in maintaining public security. A majority decision was reached, and all hotels were ordered to comply with the following measures: (1) Hotels have an obligation to prohibit certain activities by guests.

Guests arriving with little luggage, having no legitimate occupation, but acquiring more items daily and spending lavishly (unless the hotel owner knows the person well and there are no other suspicious circumstances, in which case reporting is not required; the hotel owner will be responsible); 5. Lone female guests suspected of being runaways; 6. In the event of a female guest's death, her clothing, boxes, and other items must not be moved, rummaged through, or stolen without official inspection; 7.

<h3>Songjiang: Discovery of Poisoned Candies</h3>
<p>Malubiao Bridge in this city is a major thoroughfare connecting the railway station to the urban area, with a constant flow of pedestrians. On the afternoon of the 28th, colored paper-wrapped candies were discovered on the road. Children picked them up and brought them home. Upon inspection by family members, it was found that the soft candies contained mercury, and the hard candies contained red powder. The candies were sent to a doctor for examination, and it was confirmed that they contained arsenic. This is clearly a malicious plot of poisoning, the consequences of which are unimaginable. The family has reported the matter to the Public Security Bureau to investigate and punish the person who scattered the candies.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Suspicious Case of Maid's Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Geng Jiannan, residing at No. 56 Dashidun Lane, kept a maid named Miaoxing, aged twelve. She suddenly drowned herself in a well on the night of the 27th. Her body was retrieved and placed beside a mound on Minzhi Road. On the morning of the 28th, Geng vaguely reported to the District Procuratorate that his biological daughter had accidentally fallen into the well and died, requesting permission to waive an inquest. However, rumors spread among the neighbors that Miaoxing had been abused by her mistress, often beaten severely, and committed suicide by drowning to escape her suffering. A large crowd gathered, and opinions varied, with no consensus. Fearing the matter would escalate, Geng had the body placed in a coffin and transported to Nanyuan for burial at noon. The matter came to the attention of the Fifth Precinct of the Second Branch Bureau. Officer Li, considering the matter serious and finding no such daughter listed in Geng Jiannan's household registration, believed there was more to the story. He personally conducted a detailed investigation to clarify the truth, considering exhumation if necessary.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Large Meteor Observed in the Sky</h3>
<p>At 9:30 PM on the 27th, a large meteor suddenly appeared in the sky, moving from north to south for about thirty seconds. Its light was extremely bright, like a fireball being thrown down. All who witnessed it were amazed. This is recorded for astronomical research.</p>
<h3>Sericulture Industry Opposes Unified Control of Original Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>The silkworm egg trade associations of Wuxian, Wuxi, and Wujin counties recently protested the Provincial Original Silkworm Egg Guidance Center's proposal to unify control of original silkworm eggs. They believe this undermines the safety of agricultural seeds, endangers the foundation of sericulture, demonstrates a lack of scientific understanding and factual knowledge, and amounts to centralized manufacturing, monopolistic sales, and illegal restrictions on the amount of silkworms raised per sheet of eggs. They further argue that this goes against the Construction Department's aim of improving sericulture. Yesterday, they presented six points of argument, refuting the proposal with reason, and have jointly petitioned the Construction Department to reject it strictly in order to protect sericulture and benefit agriculture.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Resolutions of the Party-Government Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Government convened a Party-Government Discussion Meeting on the 17th. Eleven people attended, including Wang Qiyi and Hou Houzong. Hou Houzong chaired the meeting. Matters discussed: (1) The County Party Department's request to reconsider the rickshaw fare issue. Decision: The rickshaw fare will be 28 cents (大洋) per trip, regardless of type. If copper coins or small silver coins are used, the fare will be calculated according to the current market price (公告 and reported to the Department). (2) The canal in this county has not been fully dredged since the Gongzhen dredging project. The bases of the dams on the main and tributary rivers have not been removed, severely affecting water transportation. How should we address this? Decision: Submit a request to the Construction Department to send personnel to survey and verify the matter. (3) Xinfeng Street, south of the railway station, is a vital transportation route and is currently being renovated, but funds are insufficient. How should we raise the necessary funds? Decision: The total cost of the road surface, drainage, and other projects is estimated at 12,000 yuan. In addition to the 7,500 yuan covered by construction funds, the remaining amount will be raised through donations from the mountain and forestry district chiefs.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Military and Police Search Riverboats for Hidden Bandits</h3>
<p>Riverboats operating on the Tong-Shanghai and Shanghai routes have recently experienced a series of bandit incidents. Military and police forces along the route, acting on orders from the Security Command, are carefully searching riverboats arriving in the area and inspecting passengers boarding and disembarking, in order to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Hailstorm Reduces the Value of Late Rice Crops</h3>
<p>At 4 PM on the 25th, in the Heshangdian area of the Third District of Xiaoshan County, the sky suddenly filled with dark clouds, and thunder rumbled. Soon, a heavy hailstorm began, lasting forty minutes. The wind was particularly strong, lasting for an hour before the sky cleared. It is reported that the autumn rice crops (温州尖 Hangzhou 糯, etc.), which were ripe and ready for harvest, suffered damage, with their value reduced by more than half. The farmers are all showing signs of distress.</p>

Just as a sick person hopes for a good doctor, China's economic recession not only affects China itself, but also affects the investments and trade of other countries in China. Therefore, friendly nations have expressed their goodwill and are willing to send experts to China for joint research. Sir Otto Niemeyer, an expert sent by the British government, has already 　臨 China, and French experts will also arrive in Shanghai soon. We sincerely hope that governments of Japan, the United States, and other friendly nations will also send their experts to China as soon as possible. Sir Otto Niemeyer is a renowned British economic expert. This time, he has been ordered to come to China for investigation. My colleagues in the government welcome him wholeheartedly, and the people of the country share this sentiment.

I have been sent to China because the British government is paying close attention to China's economy. The prosperity or decline of China's economy is related to the world economy, and especially to the well-being of Britain. Therefore, I have come to examine China's economic and financial organization in recent years in order to gain a full understanding. All of you present are leaders in the financial sector, so I will need your assistance in many ways in the future. I will visit you separately at your convenience to seek your guidance so that I can obtain a positive and good organization during my short stay in China." Following this, Minister Kong introduced Dr. Wang Zhengting to speak. Dr. Wang also made sincere remarks about the global economic trends and Sino-British trade relations.</p>
<p>Kong-Roth Talks</p>
<p>After Sir Otto Niemeyer arrived in China, he had preliminary talks with 財 Kong in Beijing, but there was no formal exchange of concrete ideas. Therefore, after yesterday's tea party, 財 Kong and Roth took the same car to the Central Bank on the Bund and 　 約 held a meeting for about an hour. They had a more thorough discussion on various aspects of China's finance and economy. Roth finally left at 7:25 PM, while 財 Kong left the Central Bank at 8:15 PM to return to his residence to rest. It is also learned that the two men still need to make an appointment for further talks in deep 　 clouds.</p>
<p>Gathering Information</p>

<h3>Stamp Duty on Checks; Legislative Yuan Agrees to Amend; Under Study</h3>
<p>The Xinshen News Agency reports: Since the implementation of the new stamp duty, a stamp of two cents is required to be affixed to each check. Due to the cumbersome process and the impact on the circulation of negotiable instruments, the Shanghai Bankers Association 　　　门 has requested 　修改. Representatives were sent by 　志华 　　　　　闻十氏 　京 　　 to petition the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan for amendment. 　谒见 　 Legislative 　員 Ma Yin 　术 　生 等, 协商 　　, 　Legislative Yuan has granted 　修改. 　修改 To which method, 期 tax revenue business, 　兼 　　 take care, is still under study. Yesterday, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency spoke to a senior banker at a meeting of the Bankers Association. He mentioned that the amended method would be that the tax rate is one cent per check. Each check will be stamped by the bank with the "stamp duty paid" seal, and the stamp duty will be collected from the user when the check is issued, which is more convenient and feasible for paying the user's account. 　由 The bank will assist in numbering the used checks, and report the total number to the Tax Administration. The Tax Administration will notify the various inspection offices, which will make the inspection easier.

<h3>Three Groups Present to the Executive Yuan; Request Encouragement of Shanghai Real Estate Circulation; Promulgate a Single Regulation or Ordinance to Expedite the Exercise of Mortgage Rights</h3>
<p>Shanghai real estate has always held an important position in finance, but since the United States raised the price of silver, foreign banks have shipped silver for export and generally do not accept real estate mortgages, resulting in a sharp decline in real estate prices and sluggish turnover. Both the real estate and finance industries are feeling the pain. Real estate developers have also 　具 methods and petitioned the government for relief, but have not yet achieved satisfactory results. According to the latest XinSheng news agency in Beijing, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Native Bankers Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce have recently jointly petitioned the Executive Yuan to enact separate regulations to lower 　厉 the circulation of Shanghai real estate. The original presentation is excerpted as follows: "We respectfully submit this petition to encourage the circulation of real estate and request the promulgation of a separate regulation to provide relief. Shanghai real estate has always occupied a very important position in finance. Investors not only consider it the most valuable and stable property, but also benefit from its easy access to financing. At that time, the society's welcome to real estate mortgages was almost above securities. Those who placed real estate could borrow money from silver banks and banks at any time. Holding real estate was almost like holding cash. The silver banks and banks that accepted real estate were also very easy to mortgage to foreign banks. This is why the silver in foreign banks was still available to us in the past. In 　 one year, the United States raised the price of silver, and foreign banks 　柜 率 shipped silver for export. They generally do not accept real estate mortgages, and those that have already been accepted are not renewed, resulting in a sudden increase in countless real estate waiting to be mortgaged and sold on the market, and the price of real estate has plummeted. The majority of real estate in this city is owned by Chinese people, and the severity of the loss is self-evident. The fall in real estate prices was originally caused by credit tightening, and this important credit instrument was suddenly hit, further exacerbating credit tightening. The fall in real estate prices and credit tightening have become a cycle of cause and effect. The best course of action now is to encourage the acceptance of real estate mortgages. This will alleviate the suffering of homeowners, and even more importantly, maintain the safety of the credit system. The effect is significant. However, in order to encourage the acceptance of real estate mortgages, we must first 　 受 the mortgagor and make it easy to recover 　川's money when it expires. In order to make it easier to recover loans, we must first make the exercise of mortgage rights quick and effective. The British Flat 　法 and most of the laws of the United States all recognize that mortgagees have the right to agree with debtors that if the debt is not paid off when it expires, the mortgagee can independently auction the mortgaged property. German and Swiss civil law stipulate that if the mortgage debt is not paid off upon expiration, the mortgagee may request that it be handled in accordance with the enforcement law. One is that the mortgagee can auction it off independently, and the other is that it must be executed by a state agency. This is the difference between British and American law and German and Swiss law. However, the disposal does not require a court judgment to be confirmed. Article 873 of the current Civil Code of our country states that if the mortgagee has not been paid off after the debt has reached the repayment period, he may apply to the court for the auction of the mortgaged property and receive the proceeds from the sale to clear the debt, etc. This is based on the legal systems of Germany and Switzerland. Pushing the legislative intent, if the mortgage right is not paid off at maturity, the court will auction the mortgaged property. The protection of the debtor is more in-depth than that of the Wu Mei legal system, and it is necessary to sue for adjudication. Subsequently, the Judicial Yuan had Yuan Zi No. 493 interpretation, saying that if one wants to exercise the mortgage right, one must first sue for a court judgment to be confirmed before the execution of the auction, etc. The reason for the interpretation is that the Registration Law and the Auction Law have not yet been formulated, and this is not enough to show caution. See the Supreme Court's 20-year Anti-Character No. 772 Civil Ruling. This is for the sake of strictly protecting debtors, and the original intention cannot be criticized. However, the result is that even if the debtor knows that they will definitely lose the lawsuit, they can use the three-trial final provision as a tool to delay the period. The longer the delay, the heavier the burden of interest. Both the creditor and the debtor are disadvantaged, and those who hold funds must regard real estate mortgages as a daunting task due to the weak protection of mortgage rights. This reason is spreading rapidly. If, in the future, Shanghai real estate cannot be mortgaged for loans, what will the social and economic situation be like? Real estate is the largest part of the city's wealth. At present, the shortage of funds should encourage the circulation of real estate in order to restore the credit of the past. Otherwise, the market may not have a clear date. For the above reasons, we would like to ask the government to take into account the special circumstances of Shanghai and enact a separate regulation or ordinance to make the exercise of mortgage rights not subject to the restrictions of the Judicial Yuan's No. 493 interpretation, or to 更 change the interpretation by the Judicial Yuan. In places where the Real Estate Regulations have been implemented and the mortgage rights have been applied for with the law 　备案, the mortgagee may directly apply for the auction of the mortgaged property in accordance with the provisions of Article 873 of the Civil Code, without the need to sue for a judgment to be confirmed. At the same time, please formulate and announce the registration law and auction law mentioned in Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code Property Law Enforcement Law in order to implement and facilitate compliance. Is this appropriate? Please review and implement it, and the whole city will be fortunate. In addition, the decline of domestic industry has reached its peak. Improvement and reorganization require capital everywhere. Factory loans should be encouraged urgently. However, in addition to land and houses, the security for factory loans should be mainly machinery. Machinery is movable property. According to Article 885 of the Civil Code, the establishment of a pledge takes effect when possession is transferred. However, if possession is transferred, the factory cannot start work. If possession is not transferred, the pledge cannot be established. Legal facts are mutually incompatible, which will inevitably make it impossible for factory machinery to be pledged and increase economic difficulties. According to the Swiss Civil Code, movable property such as machinery has been registered with the ten-party authority as an accessory of real estate, and can be mortgaged together with real estate. If our country can imitate this meaning and enact special regulations, it will 　救济 industry and be of great benefit. We should state this together and ask your court to approve it and comply with it as a public convenience. Sincerely,</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Loan Deliberations: Factory Loan Measures; Each Committee Member Considers All Opinions; Over Ten Small Loans Approved at the Next Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee held its 13th meeting at 4:00 PM on the 27th at the China National Goods Bank. Committee members Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Peishen, Song Ziliang, Bei Songsun (representing Zhang), Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong (representing Yu), Xi Demao, and others were present. Chairman Cai Zengji reported on the daily affairs of the committee. The draft outline for the management of loans secured by the operations of national goods factories was first brought up for discussion. Because committee members and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had opinions on the matter, and a decision could not be made without careful study and consideration, it was resolved to first print and send the written opinions of all parties to the committee members for study and consideration. The original proposing committee members will be asked to attend the next meeting in person to ensure due diligence. After this case is decided, it must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and the consent of various banks and money houses undertaking the risk of small credit loans must be sought before it can be implemented. Subsequently, 30 applications for industrial and commercial credit small loans were reviewed. As a result, seven companies were approved for loans, six were approved for half the amount, sixteen had their loans reduced, and six were rejected. A total of 30,800 yuan in loans was approved. It is said that the approved borrowers will be notified by the committee to sign loan documents and receive their loans. Those who were rejected will also be formally notified by the committee. As for the reasons for rejecting loan applications, most were due to the nature of their business being inconsistent with loan principles. The committee is still accepting applications for small credit loans. Businesses and factories wishing to borrow money can obtain application forms from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce or the committee's office in the China National Goods Bank building on Tianjin Road, and apply for loans in accordance with the existing procedures.</p>

<h3>Bank Association Held General Meeting Yesterday; Du Yuesheng and Eight Others Elected as Executive Committee Members; Chen Guangfu and Seven Others Remain in Office According to Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association held its second temporary general meeting at its Hong Kong Road headquarters at 4:00 PM yesterday to re-elect executive committee members. In addition to Chen Guangfu and seven others remaining in office according to regulations, Du Yuesheng and eight others were elected as executive committee members. In addition to Zhu Yakui of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wu Hengru of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Luo Qinghua of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, 88 people attended yesterday.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the customary formalities, Chairman Chen Guangfu gave a report, stating that the association was established on October 1, 1931. According to regulations, the term of office for executive committee members is four years, with half being re-elected every two years. The first re-election was held in September 1933. As of the end of September this year, the second re-election should be held. All executive committee members elected in the first term have completed their four-year term, so in addition to re-electing half of the executive committee members, seven alternate executive committee members should also be elected. Therefore, a temporary general meeting was convened today to hold the re-election. The progress of other association affairs and the financial situation will be reported at the members' meeting.</p>
<p>Representatives' Instructions</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, representatives of Party and government agencies gave instructions. A summary is as follows: (1) Zhu Yakui, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave instructions, stating that the Shanghai Banking Association is the most important association in the city. In recent years, the city has been affected by the global economic downturn, and the market has been extremely depressed. However, Shanghai is a concentrated area of industry and commerce and the financial hub of the country. Facing such difficulties, it is hoped that the entire financial community will provide as much support as possible to industry and commerce, cooperate with each other, and struggle together. (2) Wu Hengru, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that the Banking Association is the leader of all industries and bears a major responsibility for finance. However, in recent years, a total of 20 Chinese and foreign banks in the city have closed down and declared liquidation. The reason for this is mostly due to the impact of the market downturn and the lack of cash flow. Furthermore, the trade deficit and silver issues have a great relationship. Therefore, it is hoped that the banking community will take responsibility and overcome the current difficulties. (3) Luo Qinghua, representative of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, said that although the Banking Association has been established for a short time, it has made good contributions to society, such as the abolition of taels and the adoption of acceptance bills. Recently, China's finance has encountered very difficult problems. Some people advocate currency inflation, but they do not know that after currency inflation is implemented, the cost of living will increase even more. The middle and lower classes who rely on fixed salaries will also be unexpectedly hit. This is not a fundamental solution. In my opinion, the best policy to save finance is to promote acceptance bills.</p>
<p>Executive Committee Members Remaining in Office</p>
<p>In yesterday's re-election of executive committee members, in addition to Zhuang Dezhi, Wu Weiru, Song Ziliang, Chen Guangfu, Qu Jigang, Wang Boyuan, and Hu Xiqian, whose terms had not yet expired and who remained in office according to regulations, Tang Shoumin, Xu Jisi, Wang Zhixin, Hu Jun, Bei Songsun, Xu Xinliu, Ye Fuxiao, and Jing Runshi, all of whom had completed their terms, were re-elected according to regulations.</p>
<p>List of Elected Members</p>
<p>As a result of the election, Li Fusun received 77 votes, Du Yuesheng 76 votes, Wu Yunqi 75 votes, Zhang Peishen 74 votes, Chen Zeqing 73 votes, Pan Jiufen 72 votes, Wang Yansong 72 votes, and Qi Xueqing 59 votes. These eight people were elected as executive committee members. Hu Mengjia received 46 votes, Yang Jimei 34 votes, Chen Duoru 17 votes, Shen Laiqing 26 votes, Sun Jingxi 26 votes, Ma Zhongqing 21 votes, and Zhang Naiqi 22 votes. These seven people were elected as alternate executive committee members. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM after the election.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Highway Expert Okinsky Returns Home; Engineering Bureau's Xue Cixin Will Accompany Him; First to the United States, Then to Europe to Inspect Highways</h3>
<p>League of Nations highway expert Okinsky, who was hired to work as an advisor to the National Government, specializing in assisting the National Economic Council in the construction of highways in various provinces, has been in office for four years and has achieved considerable results. Now that his term has expired, he was given a farewell banquet by Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Transportation, Wang Shijie, Minister of Education, Du Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and the Sino-Polish Cultural Association in Beijing and Shanghai some days ago. He came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and is scheduled to travel to the United States on the Xia Men General ship on October 1, and then return to Geneva. Our reporter interviewed him at his residence yesterday. He and Raschmann, the former League of Nations Health Minister who came to China, are both Polish. He is 52 years old and was sent to the United States to study highway engineering. He is currently a counselor in the Polish Ministry of Transportation and a technician in the League of Nations Transportation Department. He is short in stature, full of energy, speaks fluent English, and has a slight understanding of Chinese. He said that he came to China from Geneva in January 1932 and has been here for four years. China has made many progress in construction in recent years, which is quite surprising. The construction of highways in various provinces has been particularly outstanding. Even remote villages can be accessed by cars. Highway transportation is now very developed. During his four years in China, his footprints have covered all provinces. He has personally surveyed the highways in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hebei, Shanxi, and other places with technicians. He deeply feels that the people of your country can not only concentrate on technical construction but also focus on spiritual construction. The villagers are thrifty, hard-working, and diligent, which is most admirable. He is very interested in living in the mainland. The delicious food of your country is unforgettable. During the winter in the north, he often wears your country's fur robes, which he feels are very comfortable and warm. In your country's two-pronged transportation network, the first should belong to waterways, the second to major railway trunk lines, and the largest part should be highways, which can be easily and economically generate the greatest effectiveness. The benefits of railways are biased towards urban people, while highways are universally enjoyed by the general public. His mission in China has been completed, and he deeply feels that the technical personnel of your country have the most profound theoretical experience and can take on heavy responsibilities independently without the assistance of foreigners. This time, he and Xue Cixin, chief of the third section of the Shanghai Engineering Bureau, who was specially appointed by the Economic Council, will take the Xia Men General ship to the United States. After arriving in San Francisco, he has telegraphed to have a car specially prepared to inspect the engineering conditions of all highways in the United States with Xue. He is scheduled to inspect in the United States for two months, and then go to various European countries to inspect the highway conditions, staying in Europe for about two or three months. He will then return to the Polish Ministry of Transportation to work. When he has the opportunity, he will come to China again to visit old friends. Finally, Okinsky added that what China needs most now is the ability to manufacture and train fully qualified drivers. He hopes that when he revisits your country in the future, the vehicles traveling on the highways will be manufactured by your country and driven by your country's specialized personnel.</p>

<h3>Director of Two Railways Huang Boqiao Expresses Feelings About Inspecting Railway Enterprises; Railway Management Should Avoid Competition with Highways and Waterways; If Two Railways Do Not Find Ways to Adjust, Both May Be Injured</h3>
<p>Huang Boqiao, director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, was ordered to inspect railway enterprises in Europe and the United States for more than ten days. After returning to China, he reported on the inspection at the memorial week of the Ministry of Railways. Afterwards, Huang compiled the important points of the report into a section on the main points of inspecting railway matters in various countries, stating his feelings after the inspection. He was very concerned about the parallel waterways, highways, and airways along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway lines, and the highways surrounding the Ningbo-Cao'e section. The New Sound Society summarizes as follows: "I (Huang Boqiao referring to himself) have planned to conduct in-depth research on talent issues during this inspection, but due to time constraints, the results are inevitably superficial, which is a disappointment to the ministry. However, after the inspection, I have some feelings about the railway problems in our country, which I might as well raise for research: (1) In managing railways, we should first use a long-term perspective to determine the overall direction and avoid the past mistakes of various countries. (2) In managing railways, we should also pay attention to highways and secondary roads, stipulate mutual assistance and joint planning methods, and avoid mutual competition. For example, along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway lines, there are waterways such as the Yangtze River, Huangpu River, Wusong River, and the Grand Canal; highways such as the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, Sujia Highway, Xihu Highway, Suhu Highway, and Guancao Highway; and airways such as the Shanghai-Nanjing routes of China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation. All or part of these run parallel to the railways. The Ningbo-Cao'e section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line is almost entirely surrounded by highways. If we do not make overall adjustments, a confrontation will inevitably occur. In the future, the result of the competition will be that both sides will be injured. (3) The design of railways should be centered on national defense, followed by politics and economy. (4) Railways should be based on the state in principle, but their measures should be actively commercialized. (5) The cutting settings of railways should be standardized as much as possible. As for the existing railways in our country, there are still two problems at present. One is the current organization of the Ministry of Railways. On the one hand, it is the highest railway administrative organ of the central government, and on the other hand, it seems to be the general management office of each railway. Therefore, there should be two separate committees between the ministry and the railways. I believe that the Ministry of Railways is in a leading position. Laws and regulations related to railways, policy on facilities, the advancement and retreat of the highest personnel, the purchase of large quantities of materials, and the formulation of various standards should naturally be controlled by the Ministry of Railways. As for more minor personnel administration, under the prescribed standards, salary increases and other matters, as well as strategies to cope with business, it is best to make each railway a commercial organization, and the local authorities of each railway should handle them accordingly. Secondly, railway is a specialized enterprise. We must recruit talents extensively to maintain and develop. Therefore, how to cultivate and how to appoint talents must be mutually adaptable. After appointment, if considerable achievements can be demonstrated, then the person will be the foundation of the railway. The more people of this kind, the more solid the foundation of the railway and the greater the hope for the future. They should be given practical guarantees, and they should not be transferred or removed unless absolutely necessary, so that they can stay in their position for a long time, fully express their ambitions, and devote their greatest efforts to the railway."</p>
<h3>The Water Disaster Relief Fundraising Association Held Its Third Joint Meeting Yesterday; Xu Shiying Will Go to Beijing Today to Distribute Relief Funds; Relief Movement Will Be Held After the National Games</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Water Disaster Relief Fundraising Association held its third joint meeting of standing directors and supervisors at the Renji Hall headquarters on Yunnan Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 30 people, including Xu Shiying, attended. Chairman Xu Shiying, Su Lu Disaster Relief Director Cheng Jingsheng, Lu Bohong, and others reported on the disaster relief situation and discussed several important proposals, such as establishing hospitals in the disaster areas to provide relief to poor and sick victims. A summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Directors and Supervisors Attending</p>
<p>The standing directors and supervisors attending the meeting of the Relief Fundraising Association at 4:00 PM yesterday included Cheng Jingsheng, Wen Lanting, Qu Wenliu, Wang Yiting, Zhu Xichen, Chen Gongzhe, Xu Shiying, Quan Shaowu, Huang Bodu, Qian Jingping, Chen Jicheng, Lu Wenzhong, Li Wuyun, Chen Liangyu, Xu Shenzhi, Jiang Zhongquan, Shi Dixhai, Mao Yun, Li Zizai, Du Yuesheng (representing Li Zizai), Chen Timin, Zhu Yinjiang, Yin Ruizhi, Qian Junren, Kong Xiangxi (representing Huang Tao), Li Dachao, Lu Bohong, Wu Tiecheng (representing Li Dachao), Jing Yangshan, Zhang Lanping, Zhao Jinxiang, Gui Yanfang, Yu Zuoting (representing Cheng Jingsheng), Wang Dankui, and Xu Xiale, among others.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in Various Places</p>
<p>Chairman Xu Shiying gave a report on the inspection of the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu, stating that the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu has been recorded in newspapers from time to time. He inspected the disaster areas of Pi, Pei, Tong, and Feng in northern Jiangsu. The disaster in Pi was the most serious, and Feng County was relatively light. The Longhai Railway line was all waterlogged. There were about 40 million disaster victims. If one-tenth of them were displaced, there would be 45,000 people waiting for relief. The most important thing for disaster relief at present is to close the breaches and sow seeds. If it is past October, the seeds will not be able to be sown. Next year's spring famine will be even more unmanageable. Jiangsu's breach closure is passive. If Shandong does not close the breach, Jiangsu will be doomed. Chairman Chen Guofu is working hard on the Huai River diversion project, and 100,000 workers are being recruited to carry out the project, and to prevent the Huai River from entering the Yangtze River during the project. The most critical area today is Shuyang. The Shanghai Relief Association has allocated 30,000 yuan for relief, and the Relief Committee has allocated 45,000 yuan. Afterwards, Su Disaster Relief Director Cheng Jingsheng gave a supplementary report. Finally, Lu Disaster Relief Director Lu Bohong reported that he left Shanghai by night train on the 17th of this month and arrived in Jinan on the 18th. He inspected 17 income-generating locations. The number of disaster victims who died from disease every day was numerous. There is an urgent need to organize hospitals to provide relief.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The Chairman then reported on: (1) A letter from Vice President Ye forwarding a letter from the Minister of Railways stating that the association's request for free transportation of relief supplies has been approved and instructing all railway bureaus to comply. (2) A letter from the Hunan Province Water Disaster Relief Association stating that the disaster in Hunan is particularly serious and requesting continued allocation of relief funds on preferential terms. (3) The Jiangxi Provincial Relief Affairs Association sent water disaster report forms from various counties, totaling 45 counties including Yongxiu, where the disaster situation is quite serious. (4) A telegram from Jiangsu Disaster Relief Director Cheng Yiqing stating that the four disaster-stricken counties have a wide range and are extremely miserable, and that a small amount of relief funds cannot be used. Please prepare to use large sums of money in advance.</p>
<p>Assistance from All Sectors</p>
<p>Li Dachao of the Fundraising Group reported on the progress of the fundraising work, saying that the Fundraising Group sent more than 100 letters to various institutions, organizations, banks, and companies in the city, soliciting donations for relief. Many institutions and organizations have now replied in agreement. The fundraising performance by inviting Mr. Mei Lanfang to perform will begin next month. Several large companies will donate all of their three-day business revenue. This is currently in progress and several companies have already agreed. Next week, it is planned to add a water disaster relief donation of one dime to each ticket at the movie theater. The dance hall plans to follow the example of the Aviation Association to raise funds. At the same time, it was investigated that each Shanghai dance girl planned to donate nine yuan. This matter has been agreed to by a majority of dance girls. The problem of housing donations and other fundraising methods are all in progress. The entire board of directors of the Shanghai Chinese Business Tram Company donated 5,000 yuan, and the employees donated 2,000 yuan, and all of the revenue on National Day will be donated to relief. 10% of the Shanghai land rent will be donated to relief in the business community. In addition, a disaster relief campaign will be conducted after the National Games, with football and swimming competitions held.</p>
<p>Allocating Relief Funds</p>
<p>Matters for discussion: (1) The relief funds allocated by the association to various provinces are all borrowed from various banks. The funds received by the association have not yet reached half of the amount. How should we actively raise funds to repay the loans? Decision: The fundraising group will design and work hard to carry out the fundraising separately. (2) The Health Group proposed to hire doctors to go to the disaster areas to investigate and contact church hospitals and other medical institutions for treatment, but the salaries, travel expenses, and other expenses required for investigation and contact are 500 yuan per month, and the subsidy for each hospital is about 10,000 yuan per month. Please approve the budget immediately. Decision: Immediately allocate 10,000 yuan to the Health Group to prepare for medical and pharmaceutical affairs in the hospitals in the important disaster areas. Temporary motion: The Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association requested relief for 35 counties including Yue, Ying, and De that were affected by the disaster. Decision: Allocate 10,000 yuan for relief.</p>
<p>Concluding Drought Relief</p>
<p>The closing meeting of the fundraising association for the drought disaster relief in various provinces organized last year was held immediately. Chairman Xu Shiying reported and announced the number of drought relief funds distributed. Finally, one translated case was discussed, that is, the relief funds of the association have been distributed and should be concluded today in order to fully handle the disaster cases of this year. The resolution was passed. According to Mr. Xu Shiying, a reporter from the New Sound News, he will go to Beijing by car at 1:00 PM today to distribute the disaster relief funds donated by all parties received by the Relief Committee to various disaster areas and return to Shanghai in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Housing Rent Valuation Committee Approves Taxpayer Protests</h3>
<p>In order to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses, the Public Works Bureau's Housing Rent Valuation Committee stipulated that if taxpayers are dissatisfied with the rent assessed for the collection of housing donations, they may, within 30 days of receiving the valuation notice, obtain a blank appeal form from the Donation and Tax Section of the Public Works Bureau's General Office, fill it out according to the format, and submit a protest to the Appeal Committee. The Valuation Committee will reduce the rent as appropriate, otherwise, the right to appeal will be considered waived.</p>
<h3>The Pinghai Ship Launched Yesterday; Chairman Lin Personally Presented the Naming Certificate; Chen Jiliang Personally Performed the Bottle-Breaking Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Pinghai ship, built by the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department, held its launching ceremony at 1:00 PM yesterday. Thousands of Chinese and foreign guests attended. Two Ninghai fighter planes circled in the sky, and the Mihai and other warships in the Longhua River sounded their sirens and played military music, creating a very lively atmosphere. Navy Commander Chen Shaokuan was unable to attend in person due to official business, so he specially appointed Navy Deputy Chen Jiliang to preside over the launching ceremony. The Navy Band, which was transferred from Beijing by the Navy Department, entered the venue and played music. After the chairman led the ceremony in accordance with the rituals, Wang, the launching director and supervising official, reported on the launching preparations. Then, Chairman Chen Jiliang, on behalf of Chairman Lin of the National Government, read the naming certificate and performed the naming ceremony. The text read: "The Pinghai is magnificent and shines in the morning light. The five teeth are majestic and the heavy seas are galloping. The eagle soars and expands its achievements, and the dragon leaps to create a foundation. The powerful official towers are majestic, and the banners are colorful. The flying clouds are magnificent, and the soaring phoenix is grand. Nothing is unreachable, and dangers are overcome as if on level ground. Heng Geng looks forward to divination, and armor washing is expected. The whale waves are calm, and auspicious omens are auspicious. Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, September 28, 1935." Then, the chairman issued an order to carry out the launching work. The launching director pressed the electric bell to implement the launching work. At the same time, the chairman cut the pre-suspended champagne, and wine flowers splashed everywhere. Applause, cheers, military music, and firecrackers sounded at the same time. The Pinghai ship slowly launched in this enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Cuban Legation Relocates</h3>
<p>The Cuban Legation in China was originally located at 274 Foch Road in Shanghai. It is now reported that the Legation feels that the original site is insufficient for use and has moved to 234 Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, where it will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Reduces All Fares on the Shanghai-Chengdu Route</h3>
<p>In order to develop the route and facilitate air transportation on the Shanghai-Chengdu route, China National Aviation Corporation ordered two large Ford aircraft and one large Douglas aircraft from the United States. They have been shipped to Shanghai one after another in recent days and have been transported to Longhua Airport for assembly. The assembly of parts will be completed within a few days. The flight speed of the new Douglas aircraft can complete the 2,300-kilometer journey between Shanghai and Chengdu in seven hours, which is the latest record in China's air transportation. The company will reduce all fares on the Shanghai-Chengdu route from October 1 and will use large Ford aircraft to fly on the Shanghai-Hankou section. It is estimated that it will only take four and a half hours to fly from Shanghai to Hankou. The company's proposed fare reductions are listed below:</p>

<h3>Good News for Higher Examination Candidates</h3>
<p>This year's higher examinations are scheduled to be held on November 1st in the capital Guangzhou, Xi'an, Beiping, and other places. The Examination Yuan, aiming to select true talent among postal workers, has specially established a Senior Postal Officer Examination for this session. The government's ambition to promote talent is evident here. It is reported that the number of applicants is extremely high. However, postal regulations are numerous and complex, and outsiders rarely have access to them, which is a regret for candidates. In light of this, a certain law research society in Nanjing has made various efforts to collect various postal regulations and meticulously print them into a single volume, encompassing all postal regulations. The book will be published soon. In Shanghai, it is planned to be sold on consignment by Huiwentang. The price and other details will be announced when the book arrives in Shanghai. It is said that the store has a rich collection of materials. Not only is it suitable for postal candidates to have a copy, but also for many institutions that have frequent contact with postal services and legal scholars, it is worth having a copy.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of Ancient Pottery Shards Discovered Near Shanghai</h3>
<p>(1) Pottery Shards Discovered in Jinshan: This discovery has not been published in any publication. Therefore, only a preliminary investigation can be conducted at this moment. It was first seen by a gentleman and his brothers in July this year. In August, Mr. Zhang Feng only participated in the second investigation. In September, Mr. Wei Juxian, Huang Zhongying, Jiang Dayi, and Jin Zutong, together with Mr. Zhang Feng, visited the site for the third investigation. Currently, they are conducting research separately, and it is not yet time for publication. The claim of the "City of King Kang of Zhou or King Kang of Chu" cannot be confirmed. Furthermore, Jinshanwei City has not been submerged and is undoubtedly a relic. The historical traces of Shanghai recorded in classical books do not only begin in the Tang Dynasty and are also unrelated to the pottery shard remains on the Jinshan seashore. These cannot be linked together.</p>
<p>(2) Discovery of Pottery Shards in Zhenru: This discovery has already been reported in the communication of the current month's Shishi News. Initially, Mr. Jiang Dayi exerted great effort more than ten times and discovered five or six pieces. Later, Ms. Zhang Xiang, the daughter of Mr. Zhang Feng, discovered two pieces. This information is not crucial and can only be used as a reference for research and is unrelated to Mr. Wei Juxian.</p>
<p>(3) Pottery Shards Near Fanwangdu and Great Xia Avenue: This is completely untrue. Mr. Zhang Feng absolutely did not participate. The only thing is that in February of the 22nd year, Mr. Zhang Feng and Wei Juxian picked up Han pottery shards in Zhuangjiajing outside Shanghai, which was also reported in Shishi News. Zhuangjiajing and Fanwangdu are on different routes. This cannot be a misrepresentation. Since Mr. Wei issued inappropriate news yesterday, he has been criticized and angrily ceased the investigation. Therefore, the investigation work of the Jinshan pottery shard site is still entrusted to Mr. Zhang Feng, the initial discoverer, for research. The speculations and assumptions of other people who participated or visited halfway are all reserved.</p>
<h3>Jewish New Year Celebrated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Jewish Year 5696 New Year's Day: Yesterday was the Jewish Year 5696 New Year's Day. Jews all over the world celebrated on this day. In addition to the usual celebrations, Jewish residents in this city gathered at the Jewish Synagogue on Bowu Yuan Road to hold a prayer service. Bishop Blanc addressed the crowd, encouraging them to endure hardships, unite, and extricate themselves from dire straits.</p>

<h3>Trial of Xiang Yixin Kidnapping Case Begins; Bandits Demand Ransom of $500,000; Xiang Himself and Chauffeur Appear in Court Yesterday to Identify Suspects; Due to Numerous Criminals, More Bailiffs Assigned to Maintain Order Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xiang Yixin, owner of Xiang Shichang Foundry Machine Factory at 158 Oujia Road, Hongkou, became wealthy in recent years due to prosperous business. Recently, Xiang Yixin also independently built a Xinyi Lu Buddhist Hall at the end of Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, with a grand scale, costing more than 200,000 yuan, which attracted the attention of kidnappers. At about 7:00 AM on July 20th this year, Xiang Yixin was kidnapped by bandits while riding in his own car (Municipal License No. 7102) at the end of Gonghe Xin Road, and a ransom of $500,000 was demanded. After Xiang Shouhan, the young owner of the factory, reported to the authorities and requested investigation, the case was cracked after a month of investigation. At midnight on August 19th, Wang Guoliang, Xiang Yixin's close friend, assisted Liu Changpei, the leader of the detective team of the Xin Zha sub-bureau, and together with the local police chief and officers, rescued Xiang Yixin from danger on a small boat at Wangjiadu South Port, east of Sanlintang, Pudong.</p>
<p>Subsequently, twenty-four male and female criminals, including Ji Weiqing, Zheng Jinshui, and Lu Zhangshi, were arrested and sent to the Procuratorate of the District Court for interrogation and detention pending investigation, as reported previously. It is now learned that Kong Xianglin, the prosecutor, has meticulously conducted repeated interrogations. Those unrelated to the case were released on bail separately. Meanwhile, the Criminal Court was prosecuted for the crime of kidnapping for ransom, stating that the eleven defendants, Zheng Jinshui, Ji Weiqing, Wan Junming, Wang Zhonghong, Chen Beiming, Chen Bingsheng, Wu Xingsheng, Li Jinshan, Zheng Changqing, Zheng Yushi, and Lu Zhangshi, intended to demand a ransom. On the morning of July 20th this year, the foundry owner Xiang Yixin was kidnapped by the defendants Zheng Jinshui and Ji Weiqing, as well as Bian Deshan, who is at large, at the end of Gonghe Xin Road, and sent to Wangjia Pier in Pudong.</p>
<p>Inside a Small River浜</p>
<p>Hidden on the boat of Ji Weiqing and Lu Zhangshi, guarded by Jiang Dama, Ji Weiqing, Xue Da, etc., demanding a ransom of 500,000 yuan. The defendants Wan Junming, Wu Zhonghong, Chen Bingsheng, Li Jinshan, Wu Xingsheng, Zheng Changqing, and Zheng Yushi, etc., repeatedly negotiated the ransom, renting Room 7 of the Defeng Western Restaurant at the intersection of Luban Road and Tao'erfei Road as a place to discuss the ransom. On August 19th, Xiang Yixin's wife entrusted her goddaughter Zhou Shishi to negotiate. The detectives discovered and captured them. The defendant Chen Zhaoming confessed the location of the hiding place, led the detectives, and searched out the kidnapped person Xiang Yixin, and brought them to the case together. After interrogating the confessions of the criminals, it was undeniable that the defendants cooperated and jointly</p>
<p>Kidnapped for Ransom</p>
<p>The evidence is conclusive. Their actions constituted a joint crime under Article 347, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, they were prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge He Jingcen specially opened the 13th Court for trial. The two defendants, Chen Bingsheng and Li Jinshan, hired lawyer Yu Hualong to appear in court for their defense. After the judge took the stand, because the case was important and there were many criminals involved, he ordered four more bailiffs to be assigned to the perimeter of the court to maintain order. The interrogating officer ordered the detained defendants to be brought to the case.</p>
<p>Interrogating Zheng Jinshui</p>
<p>(Also known as Xiaogouzi) confessed that he was 25 years old and a native of Jiancheng. Ji Weiqing confessed that he was 36 years old and a native of Yancheng. Wan Junming confessed that he was 33 years old and a native of Yancheng. Wang Zhonghong confessed that he was 32 years old and a native of Yangzhou. Chen Zhaoming confessed that he was 36 years old and a native of Yancheng. Chen Bingsheng (also known as Chou Zhengping) confessed that he was 48 years old and a native of Shaoxing. Wu Xingsheng confessed that he was 42 years old and a native of Shaoxing. Li Jinshan confessed that he was 52 years old and a native of Shaoxing. Zheng Changqing confessed that he was 48 years old and a native of Shaoxing. Zheng Yushi confessed that she was 46 years old and a native of Shaoxing (a married couple). Chen Zhangshi confessed that she was 38 years old and a native of Yancheng. The interrogating officer then questioned Zheng Jinshui about the kidnapping, and Zheng replied that he was called by Bian Deshan, who is at large, to do business. He asked me if I could drive a car, and I replied that I could. The next morning, he told me to go to</p>
<p>Song Park Road</p>
<p>To drive the car. Asked, "How many guns did you bring?" Answered, "One." The rest of the confession was evasive. The confessions of the other criminals were inconsistent. The interrogating officer ordered Liu Changpei to come to the case and testify, saying that he was the leader of the detective team at the Xin Zha sub-bureau, and described the process of solving the case in detail. Then, according to Gu Liancheng, the captain of the Third Detachment of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he stated that the arrest of the bandits revealed the address where the hostages were hidden, which led to the cracking of the case. The officer ordered the plaintiff Xiang Yixin to come to the case and testify. He was 50 years old and a native of Ningbo, opening a foundry. On the morning of July 20th, three bandits jumped into the car and silenced me with guns. The officer ordered</p>
<p>In-Court Identification</p>
<p>Xiang then identified Zheng Jinshui as the bandit who drove the car and Ji Weiqing as the bandit who threatened with the gun. Another bandit was at large. At that time, the bandits drove to the side of the Tanzibowan Ancestral Hall and got off the boat, locking me in the cabin. First, three people guarded me, and later four people guarded me. He also pointed out that Lu Zhangshi cooked for the bandits on the boat. Next, according to Xiang Shouhan, the son of Xiang Yixin, he was 25 years old. The rest of his testimony was the same as his father's. Then, according to Jiang Azhang, he was 32 years old and a native of Ningbo, driving a car for Mr. Xiang. At about 7:00 AM this morning, I was driving to the end of Gonghe Xin Road when suddenly three bandits came, two bandits with guns, one of whom pointed a gun at me, not allowing me to make a sound, ordering me to drive to the middle of the road, pushing me down, and the car was driven by the bandits</p>
<p>Driving by Themselves</p>
<p>The officer also ordered in-court identification. Jiang immediately pointed out Ji Weiqing as the bandit who threatened him with the gun among the defendants, and also pointed out Zheng Jinshui as the bandit who monitored Mr. Xiang and sat in the car. Finally, according to the important witness Zhou Shishi (Miss Ye Si), she was 26 years old, a native of Ningbo, and lived on Julai Road. She got married at the age of nineteen and became widowed at the age of twenty. At this point, she felt that her life was bitter and devoted herself to chanting Buddhist scriptures. After her uncle (referring to Xiang Yixin, Zhou Shishi worshiped Xiang as a teacher in Buddhism) was taken away, I inadvertently talked with Zheng Yushi, who was also a female worker in the factory, hoping to rescue my uncle from danger. Therefore, Zheng Yushi contacted Wu Xingsheng and Chen Bingsheng. I first took one hundred yuan from my mother (referring to Xiang Yixin's wife) and gave it to Zheng Yushi, asking them how much money they wanted. Chen Bingsheng, etc., replied that they wanted</p>
<p>Five Hundred Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>To allow redemption. Asked, "According to your observation, is Zheng Yushi an accomplice of the bandits?" Replied, "Not like an accomplice, but Zheng Yushi is also a disciple of my uncle, and she has worked in the factory for more than ten years, proving that she was also dragged into it." The officer said, "This case is of great importance, you should tell the truth." Replied, "She is definitely not a bad person." The interrogation was adjourned, and the questioning officer concluded that there would be no debate today and that a date would be set for continued trial. The defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions. It was found that the bandits who first kidnapped were the Yancheng gang, so the initial ransom demanded was only 2,000 yuan. Then, the Yancheng gang combined with the Shaoxing gang, and the previous agreement was overturned, and the price suddenly increased to a huge sum of 500,000 yuan. The Shaoxing gang is quite organized and numerous, which is not comparable to the Yancheng gang. This crack-down is truly the long arm of the law.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Awards Posthumous Medal of Merit to Deceased Detective Zhang Jinlong</h3>
<p>Former Chinese Detective No. 90 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, Mr. Zhang Jinlong, fought with bandits near Yichang Road and Gordon Road on the evening of May 31st this year. After being severely injured, Zhang continued to pursue them bravely, eventually leading to the capture of the bandits. However, Zhang suffered four fatal injuries and died of excessive blood loss during the pursuit. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department deeply regretted that Zhang had served in the police force for more than 20 years and had always fulfilled his duties diligently. His death in the line of duty was regrettable. In addition to flying the flag at half-mast on the roof of the Shanghai Municipal Council Building on June 4th to express condolences and having representatives from the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council deliver wreaths to participate in the funeral, the Permanent Honors Committee has now decided to posthumously award Zhang Jinlong the Second Class Medal of Merit and to record his deeds as follows:</p>
<p>At approximately 8:10 PM on May 32nd, 1925, the late Chinese Detective Zhang Junshoulong was approaching the intersection of Yichang Road and Gordon Road when he told Chinese Constable No. 602, who was on duty there, that he planned to wait for bandits nearby. Soon after, he saw a suspicious person approaching. The late Chinese Detective followed behind for several steps. The Chinese Detective suddenly jumped forward and grabbed the bandit's collar and left wrist, pushing and pulling him towards Yichang Road. In desperation, the bandit struggled and fired a shot, which pierced the Chinese Detective's chest. The Chinese Detective disregarded his own safety and continued to hold on firmly. The bandit's hand eventually loosened, and the gun fell to the ground. The bandit finally managed to escape. The Chinese Detective picked up the gun and continued to pursue him relentlessly, firing a shot, but missed. He stumbled during the chase, blood streaming down his chest, but he never fell behind. The bandit was eventually captured by Chinese Constable No. 2005. They returned together to the intersection of Yichang Road and Gordon Road. The late Chinese Detective slowly sat down and said that he was injured and could no longer support himself. His spirit of bravery and dedication to duty can be passed down forever for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Association Sends Letter to Shanghai Municipal Council Opposing Telephone Metered Billing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to Mr. Philip, Acting Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, yesterday, requesting that he reject the absurd proposal of the telephone special committee to adopt metered billing. The original letter stated: "Dear Sir, It has recently been reported that the Telephone Expert Committee's discussion report supports the adoption of metered billing. Upon hearing this, we are extremely alarmed. We believe that the Council previously made a decision to increase telephone charges by 11 percent, which users already find unbearable. If metered billing is adopted, on the one hand, it proves that there are deficiencies in the company's technology and management. On the other hand, users will find it even more difficult to bear. If things continue this way, those who have not installed telephones will avoid them, and those who have installed them will remove them, creating an extreme contradiction. If this is the case, then the experts' ideals are deeply out of touch with the reality. We sincerely request that the Council directly reject the absurd proposal of these experts to adopt metered billing in order to comply with the principle of universal implementation of public utilities. We believe this is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Severed Limbs Found on Vacant Lot on Baoan Road, Zhabei; One Left Hand, One Left Foot, and One Section of Thigh</h3>
<p>On a vacant lot on Baoan Road, Jixiang Road, Zhabei, the afternoon before yesterday, a severed left hand (at the elbow) and a severed left foot (at the knee), as well as a section of thigh about eight or nine inches long, were found. It is unknown who discarded them. A large crowd of onlookers gathered. The Linping Road Substation was notified of the matter. Yesterday, Xu Jinlin, the land guardian of the 15th picture of the 23rd bao, was ordered to report to the District Court to request an inspection. After receiving the report, the court dispatched Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia and forensic examiners to conduct an inspection in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Liu Puqing, a Student Studying in France, Invents a Photographic Typesetting Machine; Produces Elaborate Fonts; Occupies Minimal Space</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Shenshi News Agency in this city, Chinese character printing has always relied on lead type as the basis for the original plate. Lead type is divided into different sizes, with a total of sixty sizes. Each size occupies a large amount of space. Therefore, any complete printing factory, just for the typesetting department alone, needs to occupy seven or eight rooms. At the same time, there are many Chinese characters, and it costs a huge amount of capital to make copper molds for each font. Therefore, there are only two or three types of Chinese fonts, such as Lao Song, Fang Song, and Hanwen Zhengkai, but no seal script, official script, square head, round head, or iron coin artistic styles. Recently, Mr. Liu Puqing, a national expert in fine arts photography platemaking and printing, has spent more than several years of his painstaking effort to design and manufacture a typesetting machine using the principles of photography. Its structure is extremely ingenious, and it occupies only a small room, yet it can typeset various sizes of fonts. It is also equipped with seal script fonts and other artistic fonts, which can typeset and print various books, newspapers, and magazines. It is said that the machine has now been manufactured and is applying for a patent from the Ministry of Industry. This new invention will have a huge impact on Chinese character printing. This machine can reduce the factory's footprint and save many auxiliary equipment, such as copper mold casting machines, paper plate punching machines, and lead plate casting machines. It can also add many new fonts to add more brilliance to the form of Chinese character printing. Therefore, the photographic typesetting machine is nothing short of a major revolution for the future of Chinese character printing. Mr. Liu studied printing and fine arts in France for seven years and gained a lot of knowledge. He will soon invite people from all walks of life to visit his newly invented photographic typesetting machine.</p>
<h3>A Man Was Killed in Lianxi Lane; Six Assailants Chopped and Stabbed Repeatedly; Suffered Injuries All Over and Died Instantly</h3>
<p>Inside Lianxi Lane at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Guangdong Road, a bloody incident occurred at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The victim was a middle-aged man, about thirty years old, wearing fine short brown clothing. As he was walking out of Lianxi Lane, near the entrance of house number four, six burly men suddenly rushed in from outside the lane. One of them was carrying a burlap bag containing axes, sharp knives, and other items. As they approached the middle-aged man, the six men shouted at him in unison to stop, and one of the burly men carrying the burlap bag poured out the weapons. Then, they all grabbed weapons and, without asking why, chopped and stabbed at the middle-aged man. The man was outnumbered and was chopped down in the lane. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in different directions. Later, a passerby in the lane noticed and reported to the police, who rushed to the scene and found the man lying stiff in a pool of blood, barely breathing. Both his right and left hands and feet had been chopped off with sharp axes, and he had also been struck in the forehead with an axe, penetrating about an inch deep. He had numerous knife wounds all over his body. The police urgently telegraphed the Lao Zha Police Station to send a car to rush him to the hospital for treatment, but he was too severely injured and died en route. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for an autopsy. At the same time, the responsible police station immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to pursue and arrest the perpetrators and investigate the truth. However, according to rumors, it may have been caused by jealousy and love rivalry between men and women.</p>
<h3>The China Agricultural and Industrial Bank Continues to Print New One-Yuan Exchange Notes; To Be Issued on October 1st</h3>

The previously issued one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan notes will all be fully redeemable at face value.</p>
<h3>Christian Relief for Unemployed Youth: Sent to Barber Shops and Shoe Shine Stands, Charging Three to Five Copper Coins Per Service</h3>
<p>Pastor Ye Fangui Anderson of the Moore Memorial Church on Tibet Road, along with followers Shen Ling, Shi Youhui, Zhu Youfang, Shi Yangdong, Zhu Mingqing, Zhang Yi, and others, recognizing the growing number of unemployed individuals, pooled together one hundred yuan. They initiated a program to gather unemployed people, teach them shoe shining skills, and provide them with uniforms, tools, and materials, enabling them to earn a living in society. Training has now been completed, and a commencement ceremony was held at the church yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Ceremony Details</p>
<p>The commencement ceremony began yesterday afternoon at 2 PM in the student hall on the second floor of the Moore Memorial Church. After announcing the start of the meeting, Pastor Anderson first offered a prayer. After everyone sang the "Cherish Time" song, Chairman Pastor Ye Fangui reported on the initiative's background, stating, "When I was in the United States last year, I had many unemployed friends who were suffering from economic hardship and repeatedly sought loans, but there was no appropriate way to help them. However, at that time, shoe shining was a popular occupation in the United States, allowing unemployed youth to serve in various entertainment venues, such as dance halls and large barber shops, schools, institutions, public organizations, etc. Therefore, after returning to China, recognizing that youth unemployment in the country was also increasing, I gathered like-minded people and pooled together two hundred yuan to organize a Christian relief organization for the unemployed. We started with shoe shining and agreed to recruit twelve people, train them, and then assign them to various barber shops. The group will temporarily provide each person with a daily allowance of thirty cents for meals, while accommodation will be arranged by themselves. As this is just the beginning, there may be many imperfections. Please, fellow believers and guests, provide assistance and encouragement." Subsequently, Huang Jingwan gave a speech, advising everyone to prioritize cleanliness and avoid causing disgust, which would affect their business. He also emphasized the importance of being humble and respectful.</p>
<p>List of Members</p>
<p>The twelve members who passed the examination and qualification test are: Lü Shengfu (formerly worked in a printing house), Wang Kejun (formerly a platoon leader in the army and worked in a noodle shop), Zhu Yongjun (formerly worked in a sock factory), Zhao Yongchang (formerly a chef), Yan Renwen (formerly worked in a laundry and a pharmacy), Gu Jinmian (formerly a fishmonger), Wang Yun (formerly a peddler), Cheng Baosheng (formerly worked in a rice shop), Wu Zihua (a middle school student who can do cotton ginning work), Zhang Huajiang (formerly worked in a hospital), and Gao Yunlin and Sun Yichen, whose ages range from teens to thirties.</p>

The hours are from 8:30 AM to 8:30 PM daily, charging three to five copper coins per service. The main service rules are as follows: (1) Before each day's work, service personnel must report to the group to collect uniforms, tools, etc. Upon completion of work, they must report the day's work progress to the group and return all collected items. Service personnel are responsible for any loss or damage. (2) All remuneration earned by service personnel will be kept by the group. At the end of the month, the group will have full authority to distribute it to each service person. During the distribution, the group may, at its discretion, deduct a certain percentage for raw materials and other relief efforts. As for the service personnel's living expenses, the group will temporarily advance thirty cents per person per day, which will be deducted from their remuneration at the end of the month. (3) In addition to the necessary living expenses, the group has the right to save the service personnel's earnings on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Qiu Feihai's Car Kills Girl: Second Special Court Held Trial Yesterday, Debate Concluded, Verdict in Three Days</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai, a badminton star residing at No. 217, Lane Hu, Terrast Road, French Concession, born in Penang, British Malaya, of Xiamen descent, and thirty-five years of age, drove car number 6474 on July 30th this year at around six in the morning. While driving west to east on Avenue Foch, he made a mistake and veered toward the French Concession side. At that time, Cui Zhen, the ten-year-old only daughter of Huang Hanting from Jiujiang, who resided at No. 9, Cihou North Lane, Hartung Road, was passing by. She was hit and killed by Qiu's car. The girl's father, Huang Hanting, hired lawyers Fan Gang and Huang Xuanzhang to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, accusing Qiu of</p>
<p>Manslaughter</p>
<p>and filing a civil suit seeking damages of $11,400. The court summoned Qiu based on the complaint. However, because the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of the French Concession, the case was transferred to the Second Special Court. Judge Xiong Huiben held a preliminary hearing and summoned the defendant, but the defendant did not appear, so the hearing was rescheduled. As reported in this newspaper, the case was continued yesterday. The plaintiff, Huang Hanting, arrived at the court at 2:30 PM with his agents, lawyers Fan and Huang. The defendant, Qiu Feihai, also arrived with his defense lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Mao Huasheng. At 3:30 PM, Judge Xiong and clerk Tao Zongkan convened a special hearing in Criminal Court No. 4. The plaintiff, Huang Hanting, testified that he was forty-one years old and worked at the</p>
<p>Customs Office.</p>
<p>The defendant, Qiu Feihai, was represented by his defense lawyer, who stated that although the defendant was from Xiamen, he grew up abroad and did not understand Chinese, only speaking a little Xiamen dialect. Fearing that the court would not understand, the defendant requested permission to use an English interpreter, as he could speak English. The court agreed and summoned an interpreter. The defendant was first asked about his age, address, and occupation, stating that he worked in the sports world and at the Wing On Life Insurance Company. At this point, the judge ordered the plaintiff to state the purpose of the lawsuit. Huang Hanting testified that at around six o'clock in the morning on July 30th, his daughter was going to school. Because it was early, she went to invite her classmate to school. However, the classmate did not go, so his daughter returned to</p>
<p>Avenue Foch</p>
<p>on the south side, two feet from the sidewalk, when she was hit by the defendant's car traveling west to east, causing her injury and death. After the accident, the defendant did not take the girl to the hospital but fled. Later, an ambulance came and took her to the hospital, but she died before she could be treated. The defendant's car was traveling west to east and should have been on the north side, which is in the British Concession, but the defendant was driving on the south side of Avenue Foch, which is in the French Concession. He intentionally killed my daughter. I was not at the scene at the time. When I went to the mortuary, I saw a hole in her head, which they said was caused by the car. I was very sad, and my friends pulled me away. Today, I have invited</p>
<p>A witness</p>
<p>who was summoned by the Jing'an Temple Police Station to testify. I received the news and rushed to the scene but could not find my daughter. Later, I went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and asked, and they said that my daughter had died at the Guangci Hospital and that the defendant had fled. They told me to wait there. At ten o'clock, they finally found the defendant. He invited me to sit in the car and go to Guangren Hospital. When the car reached Xiaoshadu Road, the defendant's car was stopped by the patrolman, who said that the police station had ordered his arrest. After I and the defendant repeatedly explained, a police officer came out of the station to go to the hospital, but the patrolman ignored us and went back to the police station. This proves that the defendant fled after the accident.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai testified</p>
<p>that his car turned from Route Ghisi to Avenue Foch and drove about fifty yards when it hit the child. My car was originally driving on the north side of the road, but because there were workers repairing the road there, the car veered to the center of the road. Because there was a garbage truck parked in front, the child came out from behind the garbage truck. I did not pay attention. After the accident, I stopped the car, picked up the child, and looked around but saw no one. Then someone came and told me to call an ambulance. After handing the child over to the ambulance, I left. Afterwards, I surrendered myself to the Shanzhong Road Police Station in the French Concession. The police station did not handle it, so I went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. I did not flee. At this point, the plaintiff's agent lawyer, Fan Gang, presented</p>
<p>A map</p>
<p>to the court, which the judge allowed the defendant to examine. The defendant stated that it was correct. The court then summoned witness Huang Zhengming, 22 years old, from Yancheng, a road worker residing at the Xiaoshadu Pharmaceutical Factory. After ordering the witness to sign the testimony, the judge read Huang's testimony, "At six o'clock in the morning on July 30th, the two of us were repairing water pipes on the north side of Avenue Foch. After the defendant's car had the accident, it was more than a dozen feet away from us. We heard a sound and heard that a child was killed. The defendant drove forward for about sixty feet. I rushed up and told the defendant to get out of the car. Seeing that the child was dead, I told him to call an ambulance. He went to No. 58 Difeng Road to call an ambulance and handed the child over to the ambulance to take away." Witness Zhang Xingsheng, 20 years old, from Jiangyin, who made</p>
<p>Harmonicas, residing at No. 1234, Hartung Road, Avenue Foch, testified, "That morning, I saw a car driving from west to east, and the girl was walking from south to north. I heard a sound, and the child was crushed to death. The car had already passed five or six storefronts before stopping. The defendant and the ticket collector from the public bus went to make a phone call. I can't say what happened after that because I didn't see it." The defendant's side presented witness Yao Rongzhou, 42 years old, a local, who opened an auto parts and hardware store at No. 1005 Avenue Foch, who testified, "At six o'clock in the morning on July 30th, I had just opened the door to settle the bill. I heard a child shout 'killed a child' at the door. I immediately went out and saw the defendant's car.</p>
<p>Away from the scene of the accident</p>
<p>About three or four storefronts. When I saw the defendant picking up the child, I went up and patted the defendant on the shoulder, telling him that there was a phone in my store and telling him to call quickly. The defendant first called the French police station. Because the car was traveling from west to east, which belonged to the British Concession, they would not handle it. Then he called the British Concession Police Station. After the accident, there was a garbage truck parked in front of my store dumping garbage." The judge reviewed the diagram in the Jing'an Temple Police Station file and asked the defendant to explain on the map that the width of the entire Avenue Foch was 46 feet and some inches. The location where you hit the child was 19 feet and 6 inches from the south side and more than 17 feet from the north side. This shows that your car was veering towards the French Concession on the south side. The judge then inquired about the</p>
<p>Civil lawsuit portion.</p>
<p>The plaintiff stated, "I am 43 years old this year and only have this one daughter. She is my future support. She is currently studying at school and was second in her class last year and first in her class this year. I hope that she will become a teacher after graduating from middle school and earn a monthly salary of $30. Based on this calculation, I am seeking compensation for 30 years of loss, which is $10,800, plus funeral expenses of $600." The defendant stated that he was not at fault in this case and refused to pay compensation, stating that the car was not his but belonged to a friend surnamed Wei. At this point, the court determined that the facts were clear and ordered the lawyers from both sides to debate before announcing the conclusion. The court scheduled the verdict for 2 PM on October 3rd and ordered the defendant to stay at his registered address and not leave before the conclusion of the case. The defendant complied and left the court.</p>

<h3>Jin Jiangshi Sues Xu Liangchen, Seeking Confirmation That Xu's Adopted Daughter Is Her Biological Daughter: Trial Held Yesterday, Verdict on October 3rd</h3>
<p>Xu Liangchen, the son-in-law of the paint tycoon Xue Baorun, resides at No. 2, Lane 106, Zhangjia Garden, West Shanghai. Previously, because he had no children, his mother adopted a girl named Dongxi as Xu's adopted daughter. She is now seventeen years old. Recently, a woman named Jin Jiangshi from Hangzhou came forward, claiming that Dongxi is her third biological daughter, currently fifteen years old, born on the eighth day of the eighth lunar month in the tenth year of the Republic of China, originally named Jin Yuzhen. When she was nine years old, she was given to Xu Liangchen as a daughter through the introduction of a nanny named Qian Ma (a maid in the Xu family). Now, because she heard rumors that Yuzhen's chastity had been violated, she came to Shanghai to visit her, but was rejected by Xu. Based on this fact, she hired lawyer Lang Peng to file a lawsuit against Jin Yuzhen, Xu Liangchen, and Xu's wife, Xue, in the First Special District Court, seeking confirmation that Jin Yuzhen is her biological daughter. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Yuhai opened Civil Court No. 14 to conduct the trial. Jin Jiangshi presented her case, requesting that Yuzhen be sent to the Forensic Institute for identification and summoning witness Chen Afu to testify, as Chen was fully aware of the matter. Xu Liangchen testified that he worked in the Third Army and that Dongxi was originally adopted by his mother and later given to him as a daughter. He denied that Jin Jiangshi was Dongxi's biological mother and stated that he did not want the plaintiff to take the girl back. Dongxi testified that although she was adopted by the Xu family, both of her parents had passed away and she only had an older brother in Hangzhou, about twenty years old, named Xiangsheng. She denied that Jin Jiangshi was her mother. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that Xiangsheng be summoned to court for a forensic examination, but Judge Zhang dismissed the plaintiff's requests, stating that the facts were clear, and ordered the commencement of the debate. After the lawyers from both sides debated, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the morning of October 3rd.</p>

<h3>Preparations to Establish Haiyan Native Place Association in Shanghai</h3>
<p>There are a large number of residents from Haiyan living in Shanghai. They are usually scattered in various places and rarely interact.

<h3>Publication of "Sixty Masters of Song Dynasty Poetry"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Magazine Company's series of rare and valuable Chinese literary works, since the 14th of this month, has been publishing a volume every Saturday, with poetry, prose, drama, and novels evenly distributed. The first volume, "The Diary of Yuan Xiaoxiu," and the second volume, "Liu Ting's Poetic Theories," have already been published, with elegant formatting and exquisite printing, and have been praised by readers and various newspapers. The third volume, "Sixty Masters of Song Dynasty Poetry, Volume A," is based on the Jigu Pavilion edition. Although it is not a rare classic, it is essential reading for those studying poetry and lyrics. Tang poetry, Song lyrics, and Yuan drama are the great achievements of Chinese literature, and this book is essential for researchers of literature. Unfortunately, the photocopied versions on the market are not punctuated, making them inconvenient for beginners, and the price is often dozens of dollars, making them unaffordable for readers. The series of rare and valuable Chinese literary works specifically requested Mr. Shi Zhicun to punctuate the book carefully and divided it into six volumes, each with 400 pages. The retail price of each volume is 50 cents, and the special edition is 70 cents. The entire set can be purchased for only three dollars, which is five percent lower than the photocopied version. Volume A has already been published today. Pre-ordering the entire series of 60 volumes only costs 15 yuan, averaging only 30 cents per volume, which can be described as extremely cheap. However, the deadline is the end of this month, with only two days left. The deadline is extended by five days for other places. Starting on October 1st, due to the sharp increase in paper prices, pre-orders for the popular edition will need to increase the paper fee by 2 yuan, and pre-orders for the special edition will need to increase the paper fee by 4 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Case of Yueshan Tao et al. Accused of the Huafeng Flour Mill: Xu Guannan Surrendered Yesterday to Explain His Withdrawal from Shares, Workers Hopeful That the Verdict Will Be Announced Next Saturday</h3>
<p>The Huafeng Flour Mill suddenly stopped production in March of this year. All 240 to 50 workers were ordered by the mill's shareholder, Ye Shantao, to stay in the factory with food and lodging, claiming that preparations would be made to resume production. However, on August 11, the living allowance was suddenly stopped, and a notice of dismissal was issued. The workers immediately protested, first appealing to the Municipal Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union, and then hiring lawyers Wei Weiqing and others to file a criminal complaint against the mill's shareholders, Ye Shantao, Xu Guannan, and Lu Shaotang, for fraud and breach of trust. The First Special District Court has repeatedly summoned them for trial. Except for Lu Shaotang, who was fleeing due to embezzling tens of thousands of</p>
<p>Huge sum of money</p>
<p>from the China Merchants Bank, only Ye Shantao had surrendered himself. Xu Guannan, due to his old age and frailty, had not appeared in court for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened a court session to continue the trial. Xu and Ye went to court together. Judge Feng questioned Xu, who claimed that he had left the shareholder relationship of Huafeng on June 20 of the 20th year, but only because of negligence, he did not report his withdrawal from shares to the Ministry of Industry, so he was still regarded as a shareholder. Since his withdrawal from shares, he no longer inquired about the factory's affairs. All the evidence of his withdrawal from shares was previously submitted to the court in another case. Next, the plaintiff, worker Sun Renping, stated that every time we negotiated with Ye, Ye would say that Xu</p>
<p>Was also a shareholder</p>
<p>Why not look for Xu, and the court judgment in another case of the factory also recognized Xu Guannan as a shareholder, so we sued based on this. When we were hired by the factory, there was no fixed term, and there was no announcement before this shutdown. Suddenly, on March 4, the factory director announced the shutdown, but we were not dismissed at that time. We were kept in the factory, saying that production would be resumed. Now, suddenly, the supply of food has been stopped, and we have been dismissed uniformly, going back on our words, which is a form of deception. Therefore, we still need to claim compensation for the loss of staying in the factory for six months. Questioned by the defendant Ye Shantao, denied that he had</p>
<p>Said to the workers</p>
<p>Xu Guannan is a shareholder and told him to find Xu, and claimed that he went to the Social Affairs Bureau in March to mediate on behalf of the general manager of the factory, Lu Shaotang, who had fled earlier. At that time, Fu Xiaonan and others decided to raise 600,000 to take over the factory, so they kept the workers in the factory and raised funds to maintain it. At the end of July, seeing that there was no hope of resumption of production, a notice of dismissal was issued. The factory was heavily indebted by Lu, and at the end of last year, it was already in danger. At that time, there was still a lot of wheat in storage, which was used to support it. On March 4, the wheat was exhausted and made into flour, so it was shut down. Immediately after, the debate began. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the reasons why the defendant should be held responsible for fraud and breach of trust, saying that at the time of the shutdown, the factory had</p>
<p>A large amount of flour</p>
<p>The workers felt that it was enough to cover the need for wage payments, so they were detained. Ye wanted to sell the flour, so in addition to paying the wages for March, he promised to resume production. The workers were hopeful of resuming production, so they handed over the detained flour. If Ye had dismissed the workers at that time, the workers would not have been satisfied with only one month's wages, and the flour might not have been easily sold by the defendant. This is Ye's method of dealing with the workers' fraud and breach of trust. The plaintiff's lawyer also presented the recent instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that in addition to instructing the defendant to issue one month's wages, each person should also be issued 15 yuan for travel expenses. Regarding the workers' request for compensation for</p>
<p>Six months of losses</p>
<p>One point, ordered to file a lawsuit in another court. Ye also continued to say that he had already prepared the funds for another month's wages, but he was unable to raise the 15 yuan per person needed for travel expenses. Ye's defense lawyer then rose to speak for Ye, stating that the general manager of the factory was Lu Shaotang, and this shutdown was ordered by the factory director. The flour's compensation for debts was decided by the Social Affairs Bureau. The failure to resume production was due to the lack of interest in operating by the acquirers. All of these were unrelated to Ye, requesting that Ye be acquitted. Finally, Xu Guannan's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, cited the various facts of Xu's withdrawal from shares, and the court ruled that except for the part of Lu Shaotang's lawsuit that was suspended from trial, Ye and Xu were retired pending the verdict next Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing regarding the article "Xing Da Building Mortgage Dispute" published in the local news section of your newspaper on the 25th of this month, which involves our company allegedly forcibly collecting rent and employing a Japanese person, Okamoto Otsuichi, using lawyer Murakami's name, to forcibly collect rent. This seriously damages our company's reputation. After investigation, our company is registered with the British Consulate and signed a lease agreement with Jin Xing Company as early as September of last year, thus legally obtaining the right to collect rent on the relevant properties, which cannot be infringed upon by anyone. This was also registered with the British Consulate and is on record. Moreover, the Central Trust Company filed a lawsuit with the British Consulate against our company, requesting that we not be allowed to collect rent. Afterward, realizing that their case was weak, they withdrew the lawsuit. As for the Japanese Okamoto Otsuichi, he has a mortgage relationship with our company. His dispatch of people to collect rent is an exercise of his mortgage rights and cannot be compared to so-called forced rent collection. The content published in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts and harms our company's reputation. Our company finds it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we are writing to you specifically, requesting that you investigate and make corrections.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Yieh Hsing Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>September 28, 1935</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding your newspaper's report on the 26th that at noon, the Xiechang Celluloid Factory at Lane 176, Hujiaqiao Road, Hongkou, caught fire, lasting for two hours. Fortunately, the Zhabei fire brigades arrived upon hearing the alarm and extinguished the fire. However, smoke remained, and the Hongzhen Fire Brigade stayed on the scene to continue extinguishing the fire, etc., is slightly inaccurate. After investigation, our brigade was the first to arrive upon hearing the alarm. Subsequently, the Zhabei fire brigades and the Hongzhen Fire Brigade arrived one after another and put out the fire. Because the location is closer to our brigade, we left a hose cart there to continue extinguishing the fire until after 5:00 PM when it was completely extinguished. Therefore, we are writing to correct this and hope it will be published in the Letters to the Editor section.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hujiaqiao Fire Brigade</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau: Deadline for Registering Opium Addicts and Implementing Detailed Rules</h3>
<p>1.  These Detailed Rules are formulated in accordance with Article 16 of the "Regulations on Registering Opium Addicts Within a Prescribed Time Limit" promulgated by the Chairman's Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>2.  The Bureau has established a special Opium Addict Registration Section to handle matters related to registering and issuing licenses to opium addicts. The household registration police officers of the subordinate branches will concurrently handle these duties.</p>
<p>3.  The Bureau's deadline for registering opium addicts is set at half a year, divided into two periods of three months each. During the first period, opium addicts are allowed to voluntarily register. The Bureau will issue a notice encouraging opium addicts to come to the Bureau to register voluntarily, from July to the end of September of this year. The second period is for compulsory registration, during which the Bureau will strictly investigate and arrest opium addicts who secretly smoke opium within the jurisdiction and order those captured to register, from October to the end of December of this year. After the deadline, registration will be stopped, and opium cessation licenses will no longer be issued.</p>
<p>4.  The Bureau has prepared opium addict registration application forms, listing columns for name, gender, age, occupation, address, cause of addiction, daily consumption, and type of opium usually smoked. These forms will be distributed to all subordinate branches and then to each police station for opium addicts to obtain at any time. After filling out the registration application form, opium addicts can send it directly to the Bureau or its subordinate agencies and immediately obtain an opium cessation license.</p>
<p>5.  During the voluntary registration period for opium addicts (July to the end of September), the Bureau will print and distribute announcements in plain language and concise slogans explaining the main points of registering opium addicts and the penalties for not reporting, and post them widely. It will also publish detailed information in various newspapers to promote awareness. The Bureau will also order the heads of each branch and the household registration police officers to organize advocacy teams, carry promotional materials and registration application forms, and distribute them door-to-door to ensure that no one is missed. All heads of the branch offices and household registration police officers are responsible for advocating for opium addicts to register. A list of efforts made in each month will be compiled and submitted to the Bureau for review and evaluation, to be used as the basis for rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>6.  During the voluntary registration period for opium addicts, if any opium addicts are caught by the branch offices, they should be encouraged to register and obtain a license. If they are unwilling to obtain a license, they may be required to sign a pledge to quit smoking within three months. If it is found that they have not quit after three months, they will be sent to the Municipal Opium Cessation Hospital to be forced to quit.</p>
<p>7.  During the voluntary registration period for opium addicts, those who register will be allowed to go to the Municipal Opium Cessation Hospital for free treatment to show preferential treatment.</p>
<p>8.

<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Tennis First Day: Shanghai Takes a 2-0 Lead; One More Win Today Secures the Championship; Shanghai Also Wins Women's Doubles Yesterday; Xu Huipeng vs. Lin Baohua Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Tennis Taegeuk Cup competition opened at the French Club court yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM. There was one men's singles, one men's doubles, and one women's doubles match. As a result of the competition, the Shanghai team, with its exceptionally strong strength, won all three matches. The defeat of the Hong Kong team in the women's doubles was the most regrettable. The Shanghai team has already won two men's matches, and one more win today will secure the championship. The situation in the women's competition still seems undecided. The spectators yesterday were numerous, estimated to be nearly a thousand people. The results of the competition are listed below:</p>
<p>Men's Team</p>
<p>Women's Team</p>
<p>Lin-Qiu Doubles Easily Defeats Li-Xu</p>
<p>In the men's doubles, Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai are veterans of the court. Their victory was expected. Although Li Huitang is a newcomer, his tennis skills are quite commendable. His serve is quite sharp, and his backhand shots are particularly insightful, often hitting surprising balls. Unfortunately, Xu Runpei is too weak, and their cooperation is not ideal, which is the reason for their defeat. In the first set, Li Huitang played well and won the first game. Lin and Qiu then won five consecutive games, gaining great momentum. Although the Hong Kong team managed to pull back the seventh game, the overall momentum was lost, and Shanghai took the lead with 6-2. In the second set, Li and Xu tried to recover and resisted hard, creating a tie game. After each being equal, they then lost two consecutive games. Then Huitang won a game with his sharp serve, but Lin and Qiu took it back. Shanghai won the second set with 6-4. In the third set, Li and Xu won the first game, and Lin and Qiu won five consecutive games. The overall momentum was lost, and the Hong Kong team was unable to recover, eventually losing with 6-3. The total score was 3-0, with Shanghai winning.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Narrowly Loses Women's Doubles</p>
<p>Following the men's doubles, the women's doubles took to the court. Mrs. Wilson of the Hong Kong team was unusually fierce, with her volley and overhead skills being quite impressive. Although Miss Hancock has some merits, her movements are stiff, often leaving Mrs. Wilson to carry the team alone. The two veterans of the Shanghai team were not young. Moore was brave and skillful, showing great experience. Harris's hair was already gray, but she was still able to cope, which was commendable. Moore served, but using an underhand style, which was unique. In the first set, Mrs. Wilson served, and the Hong Kong team took the first two games. The Shanghai team took back one game, and then lost two more games. Back and forth, the Hong Kong team took the lead in the first set with 6-2. In the second set, the situation was still in Hong Kong's favor. Mrs. Wilson attacked from near and far, flying all over the court. Her performance was so exciting that the whole court was filled with thunderous applause, creating a dominant situation of 5-3. The Hong Kong team was on the verge of victory, with the score at 4-3 in the ninth game. One more point would have sealed the deal. However, Miss Hancock lightly committed suicide twice, allowing the Shanghai team to win three consecutive games, turning defeat into victory, and eventually winning the second set with 7-5. The final set was crucial, with the Hong Kong team taking one game with a score of 2-4. After the Shanghai team took back two games, Mrs. Wilson showed her great power and took another game, creating a score of 5-3. Everyone thought the Hong Kong team would win without a doubt. Who knew that Miss Hancock did not help, repeatedly making mistakes, and Mrs. Wilson could not carry the team alone. The Shanghai team took the opportunity to swallow six consecutive games, eventually ending with a score of 7-10, with the Shanghai team winning 2-1.</p>
<p>He Jialiu Fights Hard Against Carlson</p>
<p>The final men's first singles match between Carlson and He Jialiu turned out to be a fierce battle of four sets, which was quite unexpected. Jialiu's performance was also particularly careful, able to run and cope calmly. His baseline shots have improved significantly compared to when he represented Hong Kong in previous years. Carlson's performance was not as good as in the past, and his unforced errors were frequent. Jialiu, after a hard struggle, eventually lost in the final set due to lack of energy. In the first set, the competition between the two sides was intense, with repeated ties. Carlson displayed his power and took the lead with 7-9. In the second set, Jialiu resisted hard, but with only defense and no offense, Carlson won again with 6-4. In the third set, Carlson had victory in hand and inevitably became careless, allowing Jialiu to take it back with 7-5. In the fourth set, Jialiu gradually became discouraged and lost momentum. Carlson took six consecutive games, and the victory was decided.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Tennis Club to Hold a Tennis Extravaganza; Date Set for the 5th and 6th of Next Month; Gathering Stars from Hong Kong and Shanghai in One Place</h3>

<h3>Li Dachao and Others Initiate the First Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Swimming Competition; A Performance Will Be Held at the Municipal Swimming Pool on the 1st Evening; This Time as a Performance, Officially Held Next Year; The Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Team Will Face Shanghai Western Team on the 2nd Evening</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong delegation of male and female swimmers participating in the National Games departed from Hong Kong yesterday and is scheduled to hold a performance match with famous Chinese and Western athletes in the city at the Municipal Swimming Pool on the evenings of the 1st and 2nd of next month. It is understood that Mr. Li Dachao, the section chief of the Municipal Government, intends to take this opportunity to initiate the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Swimming Competition, with this competition being the first edition. A reporter from the Guoguang News Agency learned the details yesterday and recorded them as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of Establishment</p>
<p>The motivation for the two evenings of performances is that the Hong Kong delegation participating in various championships of the National Games this year has exhausted its funds and is facing difficulties in raising funds. After Mr. Ye Guanxun, the general manager, came to Shanghai in advance and contacted the Municipal Government, he initiated this competition. The proceeds from the ticket sales, in addition to covering the expenses of the Municipal Swimming Pool, will be used to subsidize the travel expenses of the Hong Kong teams. Now, Mr. Li, General Manager Ye, and others, in view of the fact that previous Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Swimming Competitions have been hosted by foreigners, intend to take advantage of the first evening performance match between the Hong Kong delegation and the Shanghai Chinese team to initiate the first Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Swimming Competition, to be held in the two places in rotation each year. It has been decided that the performance match on the evening of the 1st of next month will be the first edition of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Swimming Competition. However, the first edition will be a performance, and the official competition will be held in the second edition next year. The Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Interport Swimming Preparatory Committee was officially established yesterday, with members including Li Dachao, Chen Ziqing, Ye Guanxun, Peng Sanmei, Jian Eryi, and Liang Weisheng.</p>

<h3>Regulations of the Guizhou Education Department for Managing Private Schools</h3>
<p>The Guizhou Provincial Department of Education believes that the organization of private schools in the province has been unrestricted, that the curriculum and textbooks often do not comply with education laws and regulations, and that teaching and training methods are not suitable for education. It originally intended to strictly ban them. However, considering that compulsory education in the province has not been popularized and that county education funds are lacking, private schools can be allowed to exist as long as they do not hinder the enrollment scope of local elementary schools, in order to help promote compulsory education. However, county education administrative agencies should supervise them at all times to improve them. The Department of Education has formulated the "Provisional Regulations of the Guizhou Provincial Department of Education for Managing Private Schools," consisting of fourteen articles. The text of the articles is recorded below: (1) These regulations are specially formulated by the Guizhou Provincial Department of Education to improve and manage private schools in various counties to assist in promoting compulsory education. (2) Any private individual or group of individuals who establish a school for the purpose of educating school-age children but cannot fully comply with the current school system is considered a private school. (3) Private schools should comply with the purpose of Chinese national education and its implementation guidelines, and pay attention to the development of the body, mind, knowledge, and skills of the educated. (4) Private schools should be managed by the county government in the area where they are located. (5) The name of a private school should be the name of the village, lane, street, or neighborhood where it is located. (6) The establishment of a private school should meet the following requirements: (a) there are no elementary schools established nearby; (b) there are sufficient buildings (which must be suitable for lighting, ventilation, humidity, and dryness) that can be used as classrooms, and there are courtyards that can be used as sports fields and appropriate toilet facilities; (c) there is equipment such as the Party and national flags, a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, a blackboard, chalk, dusters, textbooks, dictionaries, kettles, daily schedules, attendance books, report cards, and spittoons. (7) The curriculum of private schools should comply with the primary school curriculum standards promulgated by the ministry, and should also consider the actual situation of the local area in stipulating subjects and submit them to the county government for approval. (8) Private schools should group students according to their level of knowledge for teaching. (9) The academic year and vacation time of private schools should be handled in accordance with the academic calendar formulated by the Department of Education. Those located in rural areas may grant leave during busy farming seasons, but the leave should not exceed one month in a year. (10) The tuition fees of private schools should be determined according to the local situation and submitted to the county government for approval. (11) To establish a private school, the applicant should prepare a petition to establish a private school and submit it to the county government for approval. One month after the start of each school year, it should be forwarded to the Department of Education for the record. The term "applicant" includes the school directors who hire teachers and the teachers who establish schools themselves. (12) A list of the names of the children enrolled in and withdrawn from private schools should be reported to the county government annually for the record. (13) Private schools that violate the provisions of these regulations and do not accept the supervision and guidance of the county government may be banned at any time. (14) Omitted.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (6)(0)</h3>
<p>— Original by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Now, go down to dinner, and try to do well, my boy, more for your own sake than for ours." Mr. Pei shook hands with him, and Don then went downstairs, completely subdued by this compassionate spirit. If Mr. Pei had followed the course of action that Archie had been vigorously urging – a good beating – the result would not have been so favorable.</p>
<p>Don tried for a day or two, but he was too unaccustomed to it. So, before long, he became bored and relapsed into his old, willful ways. One day, Mr. Pei went out on business, so the boys had no classes. They were naturally pleased and played energetically all day. When it was time for bed, most of the boys returned to their rooms and fell sound asleep. However, Don had a plan in his head. When he was alone with Ned, he revealed his plan.</p>
<p>"Here, look!" he said, immediately taking a bottle, a cigar, and a deck of cards from under his bed. "I wanted to get this cigar. You can go and get change for me, or Tao Mo can, he's rich. I don't have a penny. I'm going to invite him over—or you go, they don't mind you."</p>
<p>"Uncle Pei and Aunt Pei won't be happy," Ned began to say.</p>

<p>Finance - The Standard Silver Price Rises by Three Dollars and a Half - The Trend Still Suggests an Upsurge - Initially the Exchange Rate Hardened Approaching 80 Yuan - The Central Bank Opened, the Hong Kong Market Retracted then Strengthened</p>
<p>The gold market, after the disastrous fall of the previous day, saw a slight improvement yesterday. However, due to the hardening exchange rate, which nearly reached the 80-yuan mark, rumors circulated that the Central Bank would intervene. The Hong Kong market retracted but ultimately improved slightly. In the morning, the overseas silver market showed gains in London but remained stable in the United States. Large-scale speculators predicted further advances in the U.S. market after closing. The forward silver price for Montgomery remained unchanged. The exchange rate experienced slight declines. Although spot trading in London initially opened at 83.4 yuan with strong demand, the Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed no change for both British and American currencies. The customs gold unit rose by four tenths of a cent. The listed standard silver price rose to 910 yuan and 80 cents, a gain of over 5 yuan. After opening, it fluctuated up and down, and banks remained hesitant. HSBC and other banks showed strong selling interest, and the exchange rate weakened, approaching the 80-yuan mark. Speculation anticipated that HSBC and the Chartered Bank would maintain the same rates for both British and American currencies, which calmed the market. In addition, rumors that the Central Bank would release 105 bars of silver prompted buyers to become active, quickly driving up prices. Sellers took advantage of the high prices to unload their holdings, achieving a balance between supply and demand. Prices then fluctuated. Later, due to the tightening in the Hong Kong market, prices rose slightly. Predictions indicated a decrease in the Indian silver price by one anna, which strengthened the market somewhat.

<h3>Securities - New Short Positions Arise - Government Bonds Drop About One Yuan - Long-Term 23 Series Drops Most Sharply by One Yuan and Forty Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, unfounded rumors suddenly emerged, the environment was unfavorable, and market sentiment was depressed. Short sellers were extremely crowded in the market. Yesterday's developments showed that at the opening of the morning session, the liquidation volatility was fierce, falling sharply by 0.55 yuan. Gold shorts and the 21 series fell sharply by 0.7 yuan. The rest also uniformly declined in price. Series 14 and 16 saw the most selling pressure. In the second session, the selling pressure remained strong. Series 6 and 33, etc., were also sold. The 20 series fell sharply by 0.6 yuan. The rest also tended to fall slightly by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. At the opening of the afternoon session, market prices were quite volatile. Initially, prices continued to decline slightly by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. In the middle, the 20 series and the unified salt tax rebounded by 0.3 yuan due to the excessive decline in the previous session. Later, the selling pressure remained strong, and prices weakened again. It can be seen that short sellers remained active. At the closing, market sentiment remained depressed. Long-term June again fell sharply by 0.6 yuan, and long-term Series 23 fell by 0.45 yuan. The situation on the trading floor suggests a possibility of continued slight declines. As a result, market prices uniformly fell sharply. Salt tax, gold shorts, Series 23, and Zheng June all fell by more than one yuan. Long-term Series 20 fell the most sharply by 1.4 yuan. The rest fell by around 0.5 to 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 14.8 million yuan. The resulting changes in price are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn - Settlement Day Sees Difficulties for Spot Cotton Yarn Sales</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation is still good. As yarn stocks in various factories have decreased compared to before, market sentiment is inevitably slightly bullish. However, the overseas cotton industry situation seems to be slightly softening, and current sales by foreign brokers are not as strong as in previous days. However, selling prices remain stable. The price of 42-count thread has slightly reacted and weakened due to the excessively sharp rise in recent days. It has been found that customers have only completed transactions for 242 bales. The list of the amount of purchases as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 60 Shantou: 15 Nanjing: 20</p>
<p>Guangdong: 100 Jiujiang: 10 Wuhu: 5</p>
<p>Ningbo: 5 Anqing: 15 Same Trade: 2</p>
<p>The cotton business is ordinary, with sporadic transactions driven by factory demand, continuing without interruption. Clipped cotton sources accounted for 4,786 bales of Yao cotton and 1,125 bales of Tong cotton. Yong An Factory purchased 1,000 bales of Yao cotton, priced at 216.5 yuan per picul delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>September Marked Yarn Delivery and its Process</p>
<p>The September term marked yarn, which was listed on April 1st of this year, had a price of 181.6 yuan and gradually rose to 183.5 yuan. Then, due to disappointing spring sales and the deteriorating state of the world cotton industry, combined with the American buying houses' cash purchase policy, the prices in our country were hit. At the same time, the financial turmoil in Shanghai shook, and many banks and money houses went bankrupt one after another, resulting in abnormal commercial depression. Foreign merchants threw short in large quantities, and the pressure was particularly heavy. The market price fell step by step, and the decline became more and more intense, falling straight down to July 12th, with the lowest price reaching 162.7 yuan. It circled once at this low price, and the cotton mills were all experiencing operational difficulties, and the number of factories that stopped production and reduced work increased day by day. The Changsha Department first transported the chips in the warehouse, so the market situation showed a significant extreme of prosperity and decline. New buyers actively gathered opportunities, and market rumors rose remotely. The currency problem, the old things are heavily burdened. On July 29th, the rising wind of the public was discovered, and the long-term mind was frenzied. It jumped up more than 5 yuan in one day, and the highest peak was 179.6 yuan. Unexpectedly, the high price hindered actual sales. The currency inflation incident was all imaginary. Suddenly turned downward, re-entered the 70 yuan level, to 67.4 yuan. Extending to the most recent period, the long side, in view of the autumn sales development, decided to take delivery of the goods, and the market price remained stable. The last session price was 174 yuan, corner, which was 8 yuan and 8 yuan higher than the August session closing price of 165.6 yuan. The result was a three-day cut-off delivery price of 174 yuan, with a total of 7,500 bales delivered, and 7,800 bales remaining, of which 1,100 bales were on two accounts, and only 4,500 bales were actually delivered. The goods were 1,700 bales of 20-count whole chicken, and 2,800 bales of 17-count and 16-count Fugui yarn. The main recipients were Daji, Gengfeng and Jinchang. Yuda, Tongji and Yuanyi all flourished. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Delivery: Tongji 1,050 Yuda 1,250 Xinchang 50</p>
<p>Zhenda 100 Hexing 100 Shenji 200</p>
<p>Wuyi 1,050 Xincheng 300</p>
<p>Receipt: Daji 1,500 Xinchang 1,000 Mingde 150</p>
<p>Gengfeng 1,500 Hengchang 150</p>
<p>Warehouse Inventory of Yarn Slightly Increased</p>
<p>The amount of yarn in the warehouse of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been recorded to the end of this month, which is 7,930 bales. Among them, 2,400 bales of 17-count Fugui yarn are the most, followed by 1,700 bales of 20-count Jinji yarn. The list is as follows: (unit: bales)</p>
<h3>Mid-September Export Statistics of Shanghai Chinese and Japanese Yarn</h3>

Sixteen-count yarn accounted for 15,162 bales, and twenty-count yarn accounted for 13,157 bales. These two types of inventory were the largest. The number of counts and bales are listed below: (unit: bales)</p>
<h3>New American Cotton Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with sluggish conditions. Prices for all months rose by one or two points. There were few new customers. All transactions were limited to hedging sales and inter-dealer purchases. Initially, due to the previous day's southern hedging sales, the market hovered without advancing. Later, due to local broker purchases and short covering, and because Oklahoma and Panhandle were prepared for frost, prices slightly strengthened. Finally, with increased hedging sales, the market softened again. Spot prices were flat, and the base was still firm. There were few sellers, especially in the west, because the area had recently been affected by rainfall, leading to delays in cotton movement. Hester estimated that factory consumption for the week would be 190,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 111,000 bales. The market closed flat, with spot prices up ten points and futures down four to six points. British cotton spot prices were up, and futures were up two points. Japanese merchants made slight purchases of Indian cotton, and retail longs unwound positions. Plain, Guo, and Omula, as well as its Rossi, all rose by four annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 27th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for White Rossi cotton on the 28th was 104 rupees, a decrease of 1.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain - Flour and Wheat are Both Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw prices rise again. With foreign wheat quoted, Chicago rose eight cents to one dime, and Canada was up four cents. Market sentiment saw the current month as the last day of trading. It was initially quite calm, but it then became slightly bullish due to short covering. It is said that most of the chips being settled reached 200,000 to 300,000 bags. The quantity for delivery is expected to be around 200,000 bags. With the future months showing signs of desperation in Huia, external confidence was revived, with a rise of two or three cents. When the afternoon session opened, the current month's position closed, with little change. Futures were being sold off by factory owners, and the situation turned slow again. Customer transactions were not active, which was attributed to tight credit conditions, with a trend of buying only as needed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for future wheat was generally bullish after opening in the morning. Although foreign reports quoted only slight increases, external buyers, given the situation in East Africa, have not loosened their grip. There are sure to be problems with future sources of foreign wheat, so buyers have gradually become more enthusiastic, and prices for each month rose by four to six cents. Transactions were still active in the afternoon sessions, and prices hovered. Current speculation centers on whether foreign news is good or bad, so changes cannot be predicted. The spot wheat market is still stagnant, with high-quality goods quoted at four yuan, and medium and lower-quality goods priced lower. Shandong wheat opened at four yuan, Mingguang wheat at three yuan and ninety-six cents, and Hankou wheat at three yuan and ninety-two cents. Fuxin sold 4,000 bags, and Xinda sold 500 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Prices Step Up - Saigon and Siam Both Reach Six Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice transactions were very light, because the northern brokers had not yet completely cleared the rice that had been losing money in previous days. However, the interest in Hexia rice and Ke Xian rice on this street was very strong, and purchases were also greedy. However, foreign market prices were stepping up, and it was difficult to determine the final price. Previous telegrams showed that Saigon No. 1 rice was at 5.75 yuan per hundred catties, and the foreign firm received a telegram on the 10th that it had reached 6 yuan. Therefore, the owners were even more optimistic, and market transactions fell. However, only more than 500 bags of Saigon No. 13 and Siam Yuan rice were opened throughout the day, and they were handled by this street.</p>
<p>Ke Xian rice arrived in an endless stream these days. Yesterday, more Yong rice arrived, and other rice continued to arrive, but the interest in this street was not strong, and customers did not move. Yong rice was eager to sell, and the middle goods were 0.15 cents less, and the high goods were also nearly 0.1 cents less. The city opened more than 600 bags of Yong rice, and Jiangxi Ji Za and Nanjing rice were 400 yuan, which were also handled by this street.</p>
<h3>River Rice South Rises and North Weakens</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each gang turned sparse, with a total of more than twenty arrivals (a total of more than four thousand stones of goods). The sales market on this street moved slightly, so the tired market situation was able to tighten. Although the result was that the various thick price reductions still had no honor or disgrace, the thin price reductions included Datian, Qingdao, and Du continued to handle more than 600 bags, and the market price also had no difference. The new japonica rice was also fixed, and the Baige Daobao was also moved more than 200 bags, but the southern color was similar. The new Lu Yangjian had a smoother way to go, so the price had already rebounded by several cents. Chen Baiyuan continued to rise by more than 0.1 yuan due to the lack of goods and fragrant stomach, but Yin Yuan was ordinary.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Thirty-six or seven ships arrived. The market for each type of goods had good stomach. East new japonica rice and West new japonica rice were weak. New Yangjian, round tip, and Jiaobai tip were sold flat. The price of white broken japonica rice was nearly a cent lower, East new japonica rice was nearly two cents lower, West new japonica rice was nearly two cents lower, and the price of new Yangjian, round tip, and Jiaobai tip was nearly a cent less. The tip arriving at the port was less and the sales were active, turning tight and nearly a cent more. Baiyuan thin rice was stable, Baige was nearly two cents less, and the new Kejian was stable. A few dozen stones of Qingpu Xin Yao seed arrived, and the rice quality was still good, with the price opening at 10.02 yuan. All other goods showed a soft trend.</p>
<h3>New Beans and Sesame Arrive Sparsely, Market Rises</h3>
<p>In the miscellaneous grain market, new goods have all entered the market. Since the Mid-Autumn Festival, the annual conditions in various places have been mixed, so the market is prosperous and the cost is high. The lack of profit in transportation has led to a thin source. Yesterday, the market price for Tianjin new beans was 4.44 yuan, Jiading new beans 4.35 yuan, Jiujiang late beans 4.2 yuan, Niuzhuang new green beans 4.27 yuan, Jiangbei new jar beans 4.07 yuan, Gaoyou new red grain 3.06 yuan, Guan New sesame 7 yuan, Danyang new sesame 6.15 yuan, Nanjing new sesame 7 yuan, Guan Yuan new mung beans 5.2 yuan. Jiading broad beans have already opened to 3.12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Tunxi Zhen Mei Active in French Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhen Mei green tea from Tunxi Jialuzhuang was slightly active in French sales. Tongfu, Tianyu, Huacha, Baochang, and other Hangzhou firms all started operations, with transactions totaling more than 380 boxes. The market price was stable. Ping Shui pearl tea had brisk sales. Yesterday, Xiehe and Tongfu continued to lose more than 500 boxes in the city, and the market was also quite firm. However, the sales of black tea were still sluggish. British and Russian firms were indifferent to the intention to import, because the Indian and Ceylon prices were low.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Sun-Dried Meat Rebounds by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Sun-dried pork (round slices), previously priced lower due to loose shipments from Shi Ma, had dropped to sixty yuan. However, recently, the arrival of goods has stagnated, and sales have remained good. Therefore, the market has tightened again. It has been found that more than ten boxes that arrived the day before yesterday were sold out yesterday, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous price. If the subsequent shipments are not large, there is concern that the price may rise further.</p>
<h3>Daylily Sees Another Peak</h3>
<p>Recently, daylily has been favored for its digestive and activating properties. With properly dried supplies, there is no fear of spoilage. Therefore, the market has tightened, reaching repeated peaks. Yesterday, another batch of top-grade goods was released, priced at twenty-one yuan, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous level. The other medium and lower grades have also shown a tightening trend. The future market is unlikely to ease.</p>
<p>Investigation: Inspection Report on Imported Chemical Products for August. Domestic Production of Alcohol Gradually Meets Demand, Resulting in Fewer Imports. Fertilizer Greatly Reduced, Only Foreign Sugar Shows Increase.</p>
<p>Foreign Sugar: In August, the imported foreign sugar that passed inspection included 12,814.59 metric tons of granulated sugar, of which 11,022.91 tons came from Java, 1,790.54 tons from Hong Kong, and 1.13 tons from the United States. Raw sugar amounted to 5,143.76 metric tons, of which 2,032.91 tons came from Java and 3,110.85 tons from Japan. White refined sugar totaled 5,139.215 metric tons, all imported from Japan. Sugar syrup amounted to 3 metric tons, imported from Java. Brown sugar amounted to 24.6 metric tons, and slab sugar amounted to 51.64 metric tons, both imported from Hong Kong. In total, 23,309.89 metric tons of imported sugar were inspected this month, an increase of 6,998.97 metric tons compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Alcohol: In August, the imported alcohol that passed inspection included 61,878 liters of anhydrous alcohol, of which 478 liters came from Germany and 6,400 liters from Haiphong. The alcohol above is for medicinal use. In addition, there were only 5 kilograms of pure alcohol. In total, 61,883 liters of alcohol were imported this month, which is a considerable increase compared to the previous month. However, both pure and denatured alcohol have almost disappeared. This is probably due to the development of the alcohol industry in Shanghai, which eliminates the need for imports.</p>
<p>Fertilizer: In August, the imported fertilizer that passed inspection included 17,912.60 metric tons of ammonium sulfate, of which 2,944 tons were imported from Germany and 4,98?60 metric tons from Canada.

Potassium chloride totaled 29.04 metric tons, imported from Jerusalem. In addition, there were 120.75 tons of mixed base fertilizer and 59.80 tons of mixed top dressing fertilizer, both mixed in Shanghai. In total, 18,952.04 metric tons of fertilizer were imported this month, a decrease of 24,268.45 metric tons compared to the previous month.</p>

<h3>Candy for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Chuang Fen</p>
<p>Dear Children: You all surely know about this year's floods; the suffering compatriots in the disaster areas have had everything swept away by the water and are desperately hoping for our help!</p>
<p>The four words "Candy for Disaster Relief" above ask you to save the money you spend on "candy" and use it to help the suffering compatriots in the "disaster areas."</p>
<p>Dear Children: I know you must be wondering: suspecting that the money you spend on candy is very, very little, and even if you save it, how can it help so many suffering compatriots in the disaster areas? No! You must know that "grains of sand can form a tower" and "accumulated water can form a canal." One person's money is very little, but when everyone contributes, it will accumulate into a lot.</p>
<p>From today onwards, I hope you children will save the money you spend on candy, accumulate a considerable amount, and then hand it over to a trustworthy charity organization to help the suffering compatriots in the disaster areas. For example, if the money you save can help one suffering compatriot in the disaster area, then with so many children in a village, a township, a county, a province, and even the whole country, if everyone is as enthusiastic as you, wouldn't we be able to help many suffering compatriots?</p>
<p>Compassion is in everyone's heart! I humbly speak on behalf of the suffering compatriots in the disaster areas. I ask you children to carry out this easy disaster relief work!</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Children's Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>Kong Rong's Son's Clear Insight</p>
<p>Kong Rong was arrested for offending someone while in office. At that time, he had two sons, the elder was nine years old, and the younger was eight years old. The two sons were playing together when they heard the news and were not alarmed at all. Kong Rong asked the messenger to spare the two children, telling them to quickly flee for their lives. The two sons replied in unison, "Father, have you ever seen a complete bird's egg under an overturned nest?" Sure enough, a messenger arrived shortly after with orders to arrest the two sons.</p>
<p>Using a small analogy to understand the big picture, deducing physical principles and applying them to human affairs, the insight and judgment of these two children actually surpassed that of a wise father who was blinded by the situation! As the saying goes, "Great minds think alike," aren't these a pair of little heroes? It's a pity that in chaotic times, so many seeds of heroes are destroyed!</p>
<h3>Sing This Song as a Warning Bell</h3>
<p>— Wei Bingxin</p>
<p>Our country is weak, our country is poor, internal and external troubles weigh heavily on our nation.</p>
<p>Financial resources are exhausted, the treasury is empty, all because domestic goods do not circulate.</p>
<p>Emulate fashion, admire vanity, foreign goods are dumped and succeed instead.</p>
<p>Don't be confused, don't be deaf, economic aggression is a vicious scheme.</p>
<p>Complain about disasters, blame farmers, it's useless if you don't wake up.</p>
<p>Give your heart and work hard, develop industry and increase production.</p>
<p>You manufacture, I cultivate, living necessities are mutually supplied.</p>
<p>Dear sisters, dear brothers, sing this song as a warning bell.</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— Little Reader Gu Zhonghe</p>
<p>The cicada chirps sadly,</p>
<p>The cool breeze also awakens the cricket;</p>
<p>Go back! Swallows,</p>
<p>Nature has changed to a scene of autumn.</p>
<p>The sky is high and the air is crisp... the moon is white... the wind is clear;</p>
<p>Little insects play their heartstrings.</p>
<p>In a distant corner of the sky,</p>
<p>A few small stars twinkle.</p>
<p>A pool of quiet waves,</p>
<p>Reflects the dying shadows of two or three small trees;</p>
<p>Yellow leaves silently submit to the road,</p>
<p>Hate to see a cluster of chrysanthemums blooming near the fence.</p>
<h3>Interesting Little Toys</h3>
<p>— Shi An</p>
<p>Children! You often watch movies, which cost a lot of money and take up too much time. Now I'm going to introduce you to a very interesting little toy that is economical and doesn't take up much time. I think you'll all be very happy to have it.</p>
<p>Materials: A writing brush, a bottle of ink, an old book</p>
<p>Method: Dip the brush in ink and draw portraits or objects on the top corner of each page of the book (draw whatever you like). When you have finished drawing the entire book, it can be considered a success. Then hold the book in your hand and flip through it very quickly (the faster the better). In this way, you can immediately see the portraits fighting or the objects moving, just like a shadow play. Children! Isn't that a very interesting little toy? If you don't believe it, try it according to the method described above, and I guarantee you'll get very satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>The Benefits and Harms of Water</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Now, along the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, everyone is suffering from floods. The people who live there naturally only feel the bad side of the word "water," cursing, resenting...it. If you live in a drought-stricken area, everyone will welcome the early arrival of rain. In the deserts of Mongolia, "water" is really precious. Even the water that camels spit out of their mouths when they are thirsty must be drunk. Children! Because China is suffering from floods, you can probably see the evils of "water" in newspapers and magazines, but you probably don't understand the benefits of "water" and how great it is!</p>
<p>"Water" is extremely important to our lives. Hygiene books tell them, "Although water has no nutritional value, it accounts for about one-third of the total weight of the human body. It has the highest content in blood and digestive fluids. Dissolving nutrients, transporting waste products, and regulating body temperature are all necessary physiological functions." Also, if plants don't have water, they will turn yellow and die. If people don't get water, they will die like grass.</p>
<p>The nature of "water" is that it doesn't like to live in high places and must flow on flat land. But it originates in the high mountains, so it often rushes straight down, with turbulent waves, rushing and colliding, and the banks collapse, resulting in the tragic "floods." In the past, people knew that its power was great, so they placed mills on the riverbank, which turned immediately and ground into powder. They also placed electric motors on the riverbank to make them spin and generate electricity to develop various industries. It can also carry cargo ships of tens of thousands of tons, so transportation and traffic are improving every day. From this point of view, "water" really makes a great contribution to us. Now it's really wrong for us to scold "water" for being bad!</p>
<h3>The Story of Knot Tying</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Before the world had writing, what did people use to help them remember? Ropes already existed at that time, so they used them, although the main use of ropes was to tie things or catch animals. If something happened that they were afraid of forgetting, they would tie a knot in the rope. This is no different from what we do now when we write in a diary. Historians call this period the "Knot Tying Period," saying that "in ancient times, knots were tied to govern."</p>
<p>Herodotus was a historian from Greece and the oldest historian in the world. He was born around 447 BC. In his history, there is a story about knot tying as follows:</p>
<p>"King Darius took a leather belt, tied sixty knots on it, and then summoned the people of Ionia, whom he called kings, and said to them, 'People of Ionia, listen! I am going to revoke the previous order to guard the bridge. Look, here is a leather belt. Take it and listen to my instructions. I am now leaving you to go to Scythia. After I leave, you must untie one knot every day until the last knot is untied. If I have not returned by then, you may leave your post and sail back to your old home. At the same time, you must know that my plan has changed, and you must do your best to guard the bridge. If you can do this, you will be doing your duty to me in a great way.' After Darius finished speaking, he galloped away."</p>
<p>This is a historical fact about using knot tying to help remember things. In addition, in ancient places such as Peru in South America, they also tied ropes of various colors to record various things.</p>
<h3>Story Picture</h3>
<p>— Zhang Youjian</p>
<p>—Shot Hurt Again—</p>
<p>(1) Rong Er packed a bamboo basket of things and came to have a picnic in the suburbs; but Fei Er hadn't arrived on time yet.</p>
<p>(2) Rong Er alone moved the things in the bamboo basket to a white cloth on the ground; then opened a large bottle of soda. He thought, "I must shake it a few times first, so there will be extra gas in the bottle."</p>
<p>(3) With a "whoosh" sound, the bottle cap shot out like an arrow, hitting Fei Er in the face, who was hiding behind the tree.</p>
<p>(4) Fei Er cried and said, "I was hurt by your catapult last time, and this time I was shot hurt again." Rong Er laughed and said, "Who told you to be lazy and not come to help me, but hide here and peek?"</p>
<h3>Introducing the Children's Reading Club</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>This year is the Year of the Child, and adults should do everything possible to take care of the happiness of all children. We hope that children's cinemas, children's libraries, and children's sports fields will be established quickly in various places so that children in general can enjoy universal happiness.</p>
<p>The library department of the Minhang Public Education Center, recognizing that children in general do not have the opportunity to read after school, organized a children's after-school reading club. All children who are in school have the right to participate (except for kindergarten students in the first and second grades). The center purchased a lot of children's books for the children to borrow. At the same time, it printed testing cards and held a reading test once a month. Those with good results were given considerable prizes. Therefore, children in general are very happy to participate in this investigation meeting. The number of children who have joined is already seventy or eighty.</p>
<p>I believe that this organization is very necessary in the Year of the Child. I hope that public education institutions in various places will also follow suit and organize such clubs so that children in various places have the opportunity to read after school and receive mental nourishment. This is a very urgent need, and everyone should not think that children are not worthy of having any organization.</p>
<h3>Picture Story</h3>
<p>— (Made by Qin Qianpei)</p>
<p>(1) The little dog said to the horse: You come out and give me a ride, and I'll give you some fat and tender green grass to eat later;</p>
<p>(2) The horse waited for him, and the little dog proudly led him out of the stable;</p>
<p>(3) He didn't want to be the little dog's slave, so he jumped up and kicked the little dog far away.</p>
<h3>A Resourceful and Courageous Child</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>On a cold winter morning with gloomy weather, two burly men walked along a deserted path. One was about thirty years old, with thick eyebrows and bulging eyes, a face full of flesh. The other was older, with a face full of beard and a deep scar on his face. At a glance, it was clear that they were not good people. At that time, a village boy slowly walked towards them, carrying a firewood basket on his arm and singing a mountain song.</p>
<p>"Hey! Look! The shopping money is here," the old man said to the young man.</p>
<p>"This is really a case of no one being driven to desperation, we haven't had business for many days, which is enough to make people anxious," the young man replied.</p>
<p>As the two were talking, the boy had arrived in front of them.</p>
<p>"Little kid! Wait! Come with us. If you disobey, we will immediately end your little dog's life." Before the young man finished speaking, the old man had pulled out a bright knife from his waist and waved it twice in front of the boy's face.</p>
<p>The boy was shocked. He wanted to shout for help, but it was a deserted place and no one would come to rescue him. He was afraid that he would lose his life right then and there. Alright, alright, alright, I'll just follow them and wait for an opportunity, the boy thought.</p>
<p>"I'll follow you two grandfathers," the boy said in a trembling voice, and followed the two thugs down the road.</p>
<p>"Wang Er! It's so cold! It's not far from the market, go buy some wine to warm your stomach, okay? I'll wait for you in this broken temple," the old man said.</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay! I want to have a couple of drinks too." Saying that, he walked towards a small path on the right, took more than a dozen steps, and then turned his head and shouted, "Don't let the little devil escape."</p>
<p>"Don't worry! Don't worry!" The old man patted his chest and replied. On one side, he led the boy into the broken temple, pulled out the knife, and forcefully stabbed it into the ground, so that it stood straight and bright. Then he tied the boy's hands behind his back, tore a piece of broken cloth, stuffed it in his mouth, and lay on the ground waiting quietly for Wang Er to return.</p>
<p>The boy didn't dare to move. Before long, the old man began to snore loudly and had fallen asleep. The boy thought to himself, if I don't act now, when will I? So he quietly pressed the rope tied to his wrists behind his back against the knife blade and pulled it up and down a few times. The rope broke off inch by inch. Although his hands had regained their freedom, they were bloody. So he hurriedly turned around, forcefully pulled out the knife, aimed it at the old man's neck, and chopped down hard. Only hearing a "aiya" sound, blood spurted out from where the knife fell. He quickly chopped two more times, and the old man rolled a few times on the ground, then lay still and didn't move.</p>
<p>Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the boy wanted to escape, but Wang Er, who had gone to buy wine, had already stepped into the temple door with the wine pot. Wang Er knew that the boy had killed his partner Zhao Da and shouted, "You're so bold!" His eyes widening with anger, he picked up his knife and chopped it at the boy's head.</p>
<p>"Grandfather, spare me!" The boy was quick-witted, dodged to the side, knelt on the ground and shouted for mercy. "You kill me, and it's a wasted killing anyway. You originally planned to sell me, but if the old man wasn't dead, the money from the sale would have to be split in half. Now you can get it all for yourself. You'd better keep my life and sell me. The old man treated me cruelly, that's why I killed him. If you treat me well, I'll naturally listen to you," the boy pleaded bitterly.</p>
<p>Wang Er thought about it and thought that this made sense, so he dug a pit on the ground and buried Zhao Da's body. He finished drinking the wine he had bought, hid the knife, and continued on the road with the boy.</p>
<p>When it was dusk, they found an inn to rest in. Before going to bed, Wang Er knew how fierce the boy was, so he said to the boy, "I, Wang Er, am not as confused as Zhao Da, who would lose his life at the hands of a little devil." Saying that, he tied the boy's hands and feet tightly so that he couldn't move at all.</p>
<p>The boy lay on the floor next to the bed, how could he close his eyes, thinking that he couldn't escape this situation. Just when he was anxious, an idea suddenly came to him. He quietly rolled next to the brazier and placed the rope tightly tied to his wrists on the red-hot coals in the pot. Before long, the rope broke, but the skin on his hands was also scorched. The boy gritted his teeth, endured the pain, reached for the knife, and cut the rope on his feet. At this moment, his heart was overjoyed, and he quickly stood up and, following the method of killing Zhao Da, ended the life of Wang Er who was sleeping in bed.</p>
<p>Seeing that his enemy was dead, the boy was both surprised and happy, so he opened the door and shouted, "Come and see! I've killed a thug." Everyone in the inn woke up from their dreams and put on their clothes to come and see. They saw a person lying on the bed, blood still dripping. So the boy told the crowd in detail how the two thugs had robbed him on the road and how he had killed them one after another. After hearing this, everyone praised, "What a brave and resourceful child!" The innkeeper waited until dawn, then took the boy to report to the county magistrate. The county magistrate reported to the prefectural governor, who summoned the boy and, after asking about the truth, also greatly praised him, "You are truly a good child with both wisdom and courage!" He originally wanted to keep him in the yamen as a small clerk, but because the boy was unwilling, he bought two sets of clothes and shoes and hats and sent someone to send him home.</p>
<p>This happened in Tang Dynasty, in the place of Bangzhou. The boy's surname was Qu, his name was Ji, and he was only eleven years old. The great writer Liu Zongyuan wrote a biography for him, titled "Biography of Boy Qu Ji."</p>
<h3>The Story of the White Mountain Crow (3)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In my father’s annoyance, he ignored me for several days in a row. Although he was very irritable, he also had a kind heart. I noticed that he often secretly peeked at me, clearly willing to forgive me and call me back. My mother's eyes were even filled with love for her son, constantly looking up at me, sometimes emitting a trace of sad sound, softly calling me. But my terrible white feathers made them angry at the sight, and I had long seen that there was no way to fix it.</p>
<p>I kept telling myself, "I am not a mountain crow! I am definitely not a mountain crow!" This was true. Every morning, I smoothed my feathers, looked at my reflection in the accumulated water below, and I clearly saw that I really didn't look like anyone in my family. I murmured again, "Oh! Heaven! Please tell me, what am I after all!"</p>
<p>One night, the rain was very heavy, and I was hungry and annoyed, and about to fall asleep. Suddenly, I saw a crow flying next to me, more soaked than me, the color was whiter, and the skin was thinner. I saw him through the rain, his size was bigger than mine, and his fur was similar to mine, but very sparse, not even covering the body of a sparrow. I saw that he was a very poor crow; but even in the wind and rain, he still maintained a proud attitude, which aroused my good feelings. I humbly gave him a salute, and he pecked me with his beak, throwing me straight down from the puddle. Seeing me struggling to get up, he hoarsely asked, "Who are you?"</p>
<p>Afraid that he would throw me down a second time, I said tremblingly, "Alas! Sir, I am also at a loss. I thought I was a mountain crow, but they said I am not a mountain crow.”</p>
<p>My strange answer and honest attitude aroused his interest. He came to my side and asked me to tell my story, and I did not dare to neglect him, and told him everything that happened, sadly and mournfully.</p>

<h3>Self-Help, Self-Redemption, and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Qiong Jiu</p>
<p>At a time when the entire country is suffering from widespread flooding and disasters, Mrs. Jialun, Ms. Zhang Weizhen, delivered a speech entitled "Self-Help and Self-Redemption." With earnestness and sincerity, she urged the people of the nation to contribute generously, especially pointing out specific plans for women to assist in disaster relief. This is worthy of our attention. Although Ms. Zhang's speech is lengthy, roughly analyzed, it can be divided into the following three layers:</p>
<p>First, the suffering of the disaster victims: "This year, the flood-stricken areas extend to as many as sixteen provinces, and the number of disaster victims is as high as twenty-five million… These suffering compatriots already lead difficult lives under normal circumstances. Now, facing such unprecedented devastation, their loved ones have died, and they cannot even see their bodies. They endure hunger and cold, and they must also bear to watch their elderly relatives and young children suffer. The lives of these disaster victims are truly a living hell." As Ms. Zhang, who enjoys a "comfortable life," is able to show such concern for the lives of the disaster victims and advocate for them, she is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Second, the affluent class should engage in self-help and self-redemption. On this point, Ms. Zhang spoke even more solemnly and with warning. She said, "We must know that these suffering compatriots are exploited and hardworking people. The abundance of food and clothing, and the wealth and luxury we enjoy in the cities, are all accumulated from their sweat and blood. ... I deeply feel that those of us who live in comfort should donate some money and effort to the disaster-stricken compatriots. It is nothing more than redeeming ourselves. ... The tragic lives of the rural compatriots in China are precisely the sins of the wealthy class in the cities. Now that they are hiding in treetops and floating on the water, asking us for some coarse grain to fill their stomachs and some old clothes to keep warm, to sustain the lives that their parents worked so hard to raise, when will we, who have plenty of food and clothing, not redeem ourselves if not now? ... Private movable and immovable property is unreliable. Rather than losing it vaguely in the future, it is better to generously donate a portion today to save the lives of our compatriots." Among the general wealthy class, no one would be willing to say that their wealth originally exploited hardworking people. However, Ms. Zhang said it frankly and boldly. We hope that everyone with "plenty of food and clothing and wealth and luxury" can have such self-awareness and practically start to redeem themselves!</p>
<p>Third, regarding fundraising plans: Ms. Zhang put forward two specific methods. She said, "First, it must be universal. We must enable the majority of people across the country to do their best. Those with money donate money, those with things donate things... Even if each person donates a few copper coins, it can still achieve the effect of accumulating many small contributions into a large sum."</p>
<p>True! "Accumulating many small contributions can make a fur coat." However, Ms. Zhang has already said before: "This year's disaster area has reached as many as sixteen provinces." Moreover, the majority of people in the remaining non-disaster areas are not much better off than the disaster victims. Even if they can "make a fur coat," I am afraid that it will be a drop in the bucket and will not help much! Fortunately, Ms. Zhang has another second plan: "Second, we must advise those with the means to donate generously..." Whether those with the means can quickly donate generously depends entirely on their self-redemption. However, Ms. Zhang only put forward the following method for middle and upper-class women. "Most middle and upper-class women are consumers of luxury. Our comfortable lives and extravagant enjoyment are the price paid by our rural sisters who live like beasts of burden, working hard all year round. Now that they can't even maintain a life like beasts of burden, are we unwilling to make a small sacrifice? We can discount our daily living expenses, or allocate some of the entertainment expenses, and mothers can even take out some cake money for their children to use as a means of helping the small children in the disaster area."</p>
<p>It is not enough for middle and upper-class women who live extravagant lives to make "small sacrifices," although their lives are luxurious, and a single entertainment expense, some cake money for children, can help many disaster victims. This is by no means enough to be considered self-redemption. To truly redeem themselves, they should automatically implement a progressive, wealthy donation! In this way, perhaps they can temporarily save the disaster victims from their immediate plight, but this is also an unattainable fantasy! Moreover, the disaster situation is constantly emerging? Won't those with plenty of food and clothing have to redeem themselves again and again? Therefore, fundamentally, we must eliminate that kind of sin and prevent that kind of sin from ever happening again.</p>
<h3>Where is Her Way Out?</h3>
<p>— Tie Huai</p>
<p>——The incident occurred in Hangzhou and involves seduction——</p>
<p>Mr. A and Miss B are teacher and student, and their ages differ by more than ten years, but they secretly developed a relationship. A is a member of the press. Because of his writing skills and wide social circle, he also works as a teacher at a certain middle school, and he teaches female students. As a result, he gets to know many young women who are just beginning to experience love. Because he likes to chat and joke during class, he gains the favor of some young women. Miss B is his "prized student" (?). She often goes to his house. A already has a beautiful woman, Miss C, at home. But everyone only calls her Miss C and does not call her Mrs. A. Although she has served as A's reproductive machine and raised children, they have never formally married or invited relatives and friends, so they cannot publicly claim to be husband and wife. Some people say that A's attitude is precisely his best strategy for seducing other women. Miss B is a victim of this strategy. Miss B is an orphan who lost her parents early and has no siblings. She relies entirely on a small inheritance that her uncle won back through legal means. It is said that A helped her and incited her to use this means of seeking legal action, which harmed family relationships. Although she has money, she has lost her family support. This inheritance could have barely supported her through high school, but after less than half a year of studying, she became seriously ill. A sent her to the hospital, and after her illness, she recuperated at A's house. After she recovered, she was unable to return to school for a while, so A introduced her to a job that paid little, but could barely make ends meet. A lonely person with no relatives and suffering from illness naturally felt that Mr. A, who saved her from suffering, was as kind as a parent, and was filled with gratitude. As a result, she sold her body, and she soon became pregnant. "Miss C and I are only living together temporarily and have no formalities. As long as I spend a little money, I can separate from her. Then, we can officially become husband and wife." This is how Mr. A and Miss B made the deal.</p>
<p>When Miss B was heavily pregnant and discovered that A was also having a relationship with Miss D, Miss D's mother found out and went to cause trouble, insisting on marrying her off to another man that she was having a relationship with. Miss B was distraught and wanted to die. A then used sweet words and said, "I believe that this matter can only be understood in front of you. After Miss D's matter is resolved, I can naturally make it public with you. If it is made public now, it will be detrimental to you. I hope you will be patient for a while longer. After the child is born, it is best to give it away for adoption, so that you can continue to work." Miss B could not return home and could not stay at A's house, so she had no choice but to calmly live in a certain hotel waiting for the arrival of the small life.</p>
<p>Miss B secluded herself in the hotel, waiting for Miss D's affair to be resolved, so that the child in her womb would have a legitimate father. But A suddenly ran away. This is A's wise solution of "ending everything with one stroke." This blow made her cry and scream helplessly. Later, A's unofficial wife, Miss C, reluctantly sent her to the hospital. After sending B to an ordinary ward and paying seven yuan, she also disappeared.</p>
<p>She secretly gave birth to the child, secretly left the hospital, and secretly gave the child up for adoption. Her money, her inheritance, had already been used up when she was ill and living in the hotel. The discharge fee was paid by her herself, dragging her postpartum sick body, to borrow money from her friend's house. After leaving the hospital, she had nowhere to go and temporarily lived with her friend. Some of her friends who knew about this matter were extremely angry and advised her to file a lawsuit. At first, she was hesitant because she had no money to hire a lawyer. It just so happened that a lawyer volunteered to help her. If the lawsuit was lost, he was willing to admit his bad luck. If the lawsuit was won, after receiving the fine, the lawyer would take 70% and she would take 30%. So she brought her experience of being deceived to the law. At this time, A had already fled far away and could not be brought to justice. Miss C was still staying at his house. Besides A, Miss C was also one of the defendants, accused of aiding and abetting the abduction, and should also be brought to court for trial. When the first summons was issued but the trial did not take place, someone came out to mediate: A was willing to pay 1,200 yuan, including the resolution of the Miss D affair, to be divided equally among Miss B, Miss D, and Miss B's child, to buy out the disputes of the three. At this time, Miss B was full of hope that the law could help her? She could win the lawsuit, she could vent her anger at being deceived and abandoned, and naturally she would not accept this settlement condition. Who knew that the result of the first court investigation was that the prosecutor gave her a "non-prosecution disposition." She went to consult a lawyer, and the lawyer advised her to appeal, but the result of the second trial was also a non-prosecution disposition, on the grounds that she had no guardian. Does not having a guardian mean that she should be trampled on at will? Does the law book not say: the law does not protect weak women?</p>
<p>Appeal again? She no longer has the courage. Let it end inconclusively? But it feels too unwilling. Ask a guardian to come forward and appeal again? In order to protect her reputation, she is still concealing the pain from her family. Moreover, her guardian is her enemy because of the division of property and will not help her. She has no way to go! She wants to commit suicide. She wants to die and go to A's side. A is far away in a foreign country, free from the law. She wants to write a book, but she has no money. She wants to find a job, but she is only a junior high school graduate and has no way to get in. She wants to marry, but A once helped her break off the marriage that her family had arranged for her. Moreover, in today's society, if a man has loved someone, had a relationship with someone, and had a child, it doesn't matter. Society will give him understanding, he can still marry a wife, and he can still live his happy married life. But B is a woman, a woman in today's Chinese society with a very strong sense of restoration, a woman who has had a child and been abandoned. Who would be willing to marry her?</p>
<p>Where is her way out? I hope that female compatriots and gentlemen who pay attention to women's issues will spend a little time and thought to think for her? Of course, from the perspective of the entire society, this is just a kind of deformity phenomenon in a deformed society. But the problem related to society, space and time, originally has a lot, which is waiting for our analysis and understanding.</p>
<p>The facts are absolutely true. Because Miss B attaches too much importance to reputation and the reputation under the shackles of the old ethics, she will not announce her real name for the time being. It's not because Mr. A has a considerable status that she is afraid to speak out. Fortunately, the purpose is only to explain the situation, not to offend, so using a pronoun should not matter much, right?</p>

<h3>Going Home (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>Little Nizi came over and invited Xiu Zhen to go and watch. Xiu Zhen didn't seem afraid. She put on her cotton coat, and the two tiptoed together, hiding behind the haystack.</p>
<p>Sparse stars twinkled in the sky, the cold water froze in the river, and the cold wind pricked their ears. Little Nizi hugged Xiu Zhen, her eyes glided forward.</p>
<p>A large group of dark people surrounded the neat houses. Each of them held a torch, some with iron bars, sharp axes, some with hoes and sickles, and some carried a large stone to hit the black dog gate, "Peng ya, peng ya," it rang. Little Nizi's snot trailed two or three inches long, hugging Xiu Zhen, her mouth twisted and moved, as if she was helping the group of people with force.</p>
<p>——Open, if you don't open, we will set fire...!" The group of people shouted.</p>
<p>The door remained tightly closed, the stones continued to hit, and half of the torch had burned.</p>
<p>——Open! If you don't open, we will set fire!"</p>
<p>The wind grew stronger. Severe frost fell, and the firelight illuminated the ice in the river.</p>
<p>——It will definitely break in." Xiu Zhen said softly.</p>
<p>——Little Nizi shook her hand violently and muffled Xiu Zhen's mouth.</p>
<p>The door was already a little loose, and the door panels were gradually broken, and a few more axe blows were added.</p>
<p>While the group was exerting their strength, on the other side of the bridge, gongs and drums sounded, and洋枪 sounds rang out. They looked back and immediately became chaotic. Everyone put out the torches, some trampled them out with their feet, some threw them into the river, and some didn't even deal with them, and fled with the torches. In an instant, the darkness fell in front of the bird table, and at the same time, it was deserted. Only the sound of footsteps "shasha" was heard. They fled towards the houses where Xiu Zhen lived, and then seemed to hide down the mountainside.</p>
<p>The security team rushed over. Seeing that no one was there, they continued to fire blank guns to demonstrate their power and guarded the foothills.</p>
<p>Little Nizi was shaking with fear. The two held hands tightly and ran into the house.</p>
<p>——Ugh! What were you watching? It's so cold." The mother wiped the grass shells on her daughter's head while handing over the "tiger head" to warm her up.</p>
<p>The gunfire also quieted down. It seemed that a riot had passed. No one asked what was going on in the house of Young Master Zhonggui. The generally frightened neighbors all arranged to re-enter their dreams, and the sister-in-law also entered the room. Although the mother also took off her clothes and shoes and got into the quilt, she always tossed and turned and couldn't fall asleep. She looked very uneasy. She raised her head and looked at Xiu Zhen, then covered her head with the quilt, and touched the teapot on the bedside. She lay down again. Just as she was dozing off, she heard a "peng" sound. She woke up in surprise, immediately got up, and opened the door to go out. There was no change inside or outside the house.</p>
<p>——Mom! What's wrong?" Xiu Zhen asked.</p>
<p>——Nothing. I'm going to see if the door is closed."</p>
<p>——Didn't I see you close it yourself?" The sister-in-law interjected.</p>
<p>——I seem to have heard a "peng" sound!" The mother sat on the bedside and silently recited a Buddhist mantra for a while, fumbling as if she wanted to fall asleep. Suddenly, she twitched her nose a few times, raised her head, and pricked up her ears. Her nose twitched a few more times. She took out the "tiger head" from the quilt.</p>
<p>——Has the stove fallen over, sister-in-law?"</p>
<p>——No, it's already extinguished."</p>
<p>——Why is there a burning smell?"</p>
<p>——That's because of the 洋枪 just now...the smell of gunpowder."</p>
<p>——The smell of burning? Very suspicious, she burrowed into the quilt.</p>
<p>The wind was stronger and caught at the window. The roof ridge rattled, and the swing hung upside down, scattering ash and sand like sifting rice.</p>
<p>Lectures on Women's Issues</p>
<h3>Section 3: Education Issues</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The education issue referred to here is the issue of women gaining equal status with men in education. The main content of this issue is to demand that secondary and higher schools be open to women, to demand that women be given the same degrees as men, and to demand the abolition of all gender-based education, etc. Like the issue of political participation, this has become the focus of women's issues, and at the same time, it has become the basic program of the general feminist movement since the beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Education is originally a method of human life. In addition to instinctual life, humans also have intelligent life. The so-called intelligence is something derived from experience. Only when humans have this intelligence can they separate from animals and create the culture of human society. In order to preserve and create this cultural value of society, humans use education to pass on the intelligent knowledge of experience to each other. Therefore, in a broad sense, there has been education since there have been large classes. In the words of Dewey, "life is education." In detail, education is a way for human beings to adapt to the natural environment and promote social life. There is no distinction between men and women, and no distinction between noble and lowly. All knowledge and skills that are beneficial to human life must be explained and imparted to each other!</p>
<p>We know that in primitive and communal societies, the purpose of education is consistent with the purpose of society. There is no stratified education or gender-based education. The life rituals and productive labor of the community are closely combined with education. However, since classes and patriarchy emerged in society, there has been a distinction between men and women and between noble and lowly in education. In detail, the noble receive the education to command the lowly, and the lowly receive the education to be commanded by the noble. Similarly, men receive the education to dominate women, and women receive the education to be dominated by men. The nobles and officials in the Greek and Roman eras were the noble, slaves were the lowly. The lords and monks in the feudal era were the noble, serfs were the lowly. The propertied in the capitalist era were the noble, and the propertyless were the lowly. At the same time, men in the above eras were the rulers, and women were the ruled. There is a clear distinction in education between them, which must not be confused. In the Chinese feudal era, "the people can be made to follow, but not to know" was the educational policy for serfs, and "three obediences and four virtues" and "a woman without talent is virtuous" were the educational principles for women. In this way, education since the collapse of the primitive community is not only separated from productive labor, but also has class differences and gender differences. The historical and social roots of the women's education issue lie in this point.</p>
<p>However, by the time capitalism flourished, the civil class consciously raised this issue. The eighteenth-century French educational scholars Fénelon and Condorcet were enthusiastic supporters of women's education. After the French Revolution, the issue of women's education became a major social issue. In particular, Ms. Wollstonecraft of England concretely raised this issue in her book "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman". Since then, this issue has become the central issue of the women's rights movement.</p>
<p>In the feudal era, under the absolute oppression of women, their education could not become a problem at all. That is to say, except for a very small number of aristocratic women who acquired the knowledge of good mother and wife at home or in monasteries, most women were completely illiterate. But by this time, the emerging civil class raised the issue of women's school education together with the issue of national compulsory education. This is by no means accidental. In order to build a capitalist society, the smart civil class needed to popularize national education, and at the same time needed the modernization of women's education.</p>
<p>The capitalist production method not only socializes the production organization but also socializes the lives of all people! Social members introduced into the capitalist production relations, whether men or women, must have common national knowledge in order to improve social productivity and increase the profit rate of the civil class. This is the main reason for the initial proposal of the issue of women's general education. Secondly, the men of the civil class who have received a high degree of modern education need modern women who can "read, write, and calculate" to match their lives, and they need women with scientific cultivation to raise their children. On the other hand, women of the civil class themselves are also aware of the unreliability of husbands and families in the era of the bankruptcy of the family system and need to acquire new knowledge to protect their lives. Due to these two needs, the issue of equality between men and women in education was raised.</p>
<p>The issue of women's education raised by feminists has been partially resolved since the mid-nineteenth century. In 1867, Switzerland was the first to open universities to women, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States. Since then, countries have successively implemented opening. Until around the First World War, the issue of women's education seemed to have been completely resolved. No matter which country you are in, as long as you have money, you can enter university, acquire the same knowledge as men, and even get degrees such as bachelor's or doctorate! As a result, feminists said with a victorious smile: "The education issue has been resolved!" But we can answer like this: "The education issue of the feminists of the civil class themselves may have been resolved, but the education issue of most women has not been resolved!"</p>
<p>Of course, the doors of higher education are open, but only wealthy women can enter. But there are too many women who have no money! The problem remains unsolved! Now, feminists are no longer willing to solve this problem, because it is not simply an education issue, but an issue of having money to study and not having money to study. This is of course a problem they are unwilling to mention. However, if this problem is not solved, the so-called women's education issue cannot be fundamentally resolved.</p>

<h3>The Four Iron Chains Currently Binding Germany</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Post-war Germany is plagued by internal and external troubles, plunging its politics into an extremely unsettling vortex and causing extreme anxiety and unease among the people. All of this is undoubtedly caused by the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>Even countries with vast territories like the United Kingdom and the United States are uneasy in this global economic downturn. How much more so is Germany, whose homeland has been carved up, colonies seized, and burdened with enormous reparations? Naturally, it is mired in deep anguish.</p>
<p>The losses inflicted on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, apart from the seizure of all German colonies with an area of 1.2 million square miles and a population of 4.6 million, included the loss of one-tenth of its homeland's territory and population. The seized lands were extremely important in terms of industry and military resources. We only need to look at the fact that the lost territories contained eight-tenths of its iron ore deposits and two-tenths of its coalfields to understand everything. The treaty also stipulated that the German standing army be limited to 100,000 men and prohibited scientific weapons such as aircraft, tanks, poison gas, and heavy artillery. In fact, Germany was only allowed to maintain a military force befitting a second-rate nation. Moreover, Germany, which lost six million people in the war and spent 150 billion marks on war expenses, was still forced to pay tens of billions of marks in reparations under the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. This cannot be described as anything other than the greatest national tragedy in human history.</p>
<p>Currently, Germany remains bound by four major iron chains: 1. the reparations issue, 2. the border issue, 3. the colonial issue, and 4. the military issue.</p>
<p>(1) The Reparations Issue The enormous reparations imposed on Germany by the Allied Powers, needless to say, had already violated the "no annexations" and "no indemnities" principles proposed by Wilson's Fourteen Points. At the Paris Peace Conference, the Allied Powers initially wanted to set the reparations amount at 226 billion marks, but it was later reduced to 130 billion marks after the 1921 Spa Conference. This was the amount to be paid over 30 years. Needless to say, this burden was absolutely beyond Germany's economic capacity. Post-war Germany was already extremely exhausted, and the added requirement to provide cash and goods further worsened the German economy, causing the value of the mark to plummet. Later, France attempted to sanction Germany and occupied the Ruhr region in January 1923. The result of the Ruhr occupation not only impoverished Germany further, but also yielded nothing for France. Consequently, the Allied Powers successively established the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan, reducing the reparations to 35.8 billion gold marks and extending the repayment period to 58 years. In the autumn of 1929, when the aftershocks of the American economic panic affected Germany, former US President Hoover proposed that the Allied Powers postpone the payment of war debts and German reparations to the United States. However, the overall global economic panic continued unabated, making it impossible for Germany to pay reparations. The United Kingdom, France, Italy, and other countries then convened the Lausanne Conference in 1932. At this conference, German reparations were further reduced by 3 billion marks, which, compared to the Spa Conference's demand of 132 billion gold marks, was truly a laughable reduction. From this, one can see how serious and terrifying the unreasonable demands of the Versailles system countries were towards Germany.</p>
<p>However, will the strong but exhausted Germany take this as its final struggle? No, Germany is still troubled by the reparations issue. It wants to completely break free from this chain.</p>
<p>(2) The Border Issue As mentioned earlier, as a result of Germany's defeat in the war, approximately one-tenth of its homeland was seized by France, Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. These Germans living under the rule of other countries are a major source of discontent for the Germans. However, Germany was quite aware that it was a defeated nation and had no choice but to swallow its anger and accept the inevitable punishment. Moreover, not wanting to invite another occupation of the Rhineland, it signed the Locarno Treaties in December 1925. In this way, the issue of the western border was finally resolved. Consequently, German discontent regarding the border issue is now completely focused on the so-called "Polish Corridor" issue. Currently, Germany's main objective in demanding a revision of the Treaty of Versailles and a correction of its borders is this Corridor issue. To be sure, Germany also wants to reclaim the Memel region that was ceded to Lithuania and to restore Upper Silesia that was seized by Czechoslovakia, and it is also strongly determined to do so. However, compared to the Corridor issue, these are less burning concerns. Therefore, some observers predict that the next European disaster, or the cause of the German-Polish conflict, will originate with this Corridor issue.</p>
<p>Since the so-called Polish Corridor was ceded to Poland under the pretext of giving it access to the sea, trains traveling between mainland Germany and East Prussia have been subjected to various malicious interference from Poland. The Germans and German culture in the Corridor have been oppressed, and Danzig, as a free port, has been incorporated into the Polish customs area. Therefore, Germany has had to continuously struggle for a revision of its borders. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has voiced his support, and the United Kingdom has also cast a sympathetic eye. Regarding the sacredness of the Treaty of Versailles, which France has been proclaiming, MacDonald has said, "All treaties are sacred, but no treaty is permanent," the implication of which is clear evidence of sympathy with Germany. However, France has consistently supported Poland. Germany considers this second chain to be a source of great pain that causes it sleepless nights.</p>
<p>(3) The Military Issue At the disarmament conference of the League of Nations, Germany vehemently called for military equality with France. As a result, France only allowed "security guarantees" as a condition for recognizing "military equality." This seed of injustice sown in Germany is a reason for its slide towards furious outbursts.</p>
<p>(4) The Colonial Restoration Issue The enthusiastic pursuit of this issue is also something that Germans never forget. At the London World Economic Conference, the German Plenipotentiary Representative, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Hugenberg, strongly argued for the restoration of colonies and even resigned over the issue.</p>
<p>Currently, countries of the Versailles system are still adopting an attitude of oppression towards Germany's efforts to break free from the iron chains of Versailles. However, a strong nation like Germany will certainly not submit.</p>
<p>Germany has been resurrected, but it remains the center of Europe's low pressure. Another crisis in Germany would be the greatest misfortune for humanity.</p>
<p>Amateur Study</p>
<h3>How I Learned "Latinization"</h3>
<p>— Fu Zhongfan</p>
<p>For people from Jiangnan, especially those from Wuxi with stiff tongues, learning the northern dialect is extremely difficult. Unless they live in the north for a very long time, they will always sound like "a Jiangbei donkey trying to bray like a horse," and it is not easy to learn it well. However, the Latinization of the Chinese language has helped to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Because of my family's financial difficulties, after graduating from elementary school last year, my father asked a relative to introduce me to a glass and hardware store as an apprentice. Naturally, I had to agree. At that time, my relative told me: "That store is owned by a Beiping (Beijing) person, and the accountant is also from Beiping. Most of their business is with Beiping, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and the surrounding areas. You need to understand the northern dialect to do well!" At that time, my answer was: "So-so, it's okay. I learned a little Mandarin in the fifth grade. I understand the northern dialect, and I can speak it."</p>
<p>However, after entering the store, it was a real nightmare. I couldn't understand nine out of ten sentences spoken by the boss and the accountant, especially the boss's wife, and her temper was terrible. She would explode at the slightest provocation. At the same time, they couldn't fully understand what I was saying, because all I could speak was a "sort of like" Wuxi Mandarin. Therefore, I suffered a lot. I was extremely frustrated!</p>
<p>Later, a friend gave me a copy of "Introduction to Latinization" published by Tianma Bookstore. At the same time, he told me how to apply for [scholarship], and how convenient it would be. I immediately started learning it and carefully studied the northern dialect scheme.</p>
<p>Sure enough, I completely memorized the 28 letters in three mornings. Then, I started practicing spelling. Because Latinization uses the linking of words and the flexible use of phonemes, it can only annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Moreover, it is not as difficult as using the four tones. Therefore, I learned how to spell in less than two weeks. After that, I used Latinized and Chinese character comparison readings, practicing in my spare time every day. At the same time, I asked my friend for fully Latinized newspapers and books to read, and I also tried to spell out what the boss and the others were saying using Latinization, making great efforts to practice. In less than two months, sure enough, I could understand nine out of ten sentences spoken by the bosses, and they could also understand what I was saying. I could even talk to customers who came from the north to "purchase goods."</p>
<p>I think that although the main goal of Latinization is to eliminate illiteracy, it also greatly helps the mutual learning of dialects in various regions. In the future, after the Latinization of various regions is completed, it will become very easy for people from Wuxi to learn Cantonese and for people from Fujian to learn Shanghainese.</p>
<p>Social Science Lecture</p>
<h3>The Causality of History</h3>
<p>— Fu Baoyi</p>
<p>"We only know one science, the science of history." ——("The German Ideology")</p>
<p>A well-known domestic historian once said that seeking causality in history is "groundless talk," but at the same time, he did not deny that history is also a science. This view is obviously contradictory. Because the establishment of a science must have concrete, objectively existing things as its research objects, and these things must inevitably develop and change under the control of certain causal laws. Since history is a kind of science, of course it has its causality. Otherwise, all the events in history, the changes and developments in history, would all be accidental phenomena without any cause. As a result, in addition to rigidly recording historical facts, mankind would not be able to use scientific methods to explain history, to explain the reasons for all historical facts.</p>
<p>History is a record of mankind's past life, and mankind lives in society. Therefore, history cannot be discussed separately from society. Therefore, history, like economics and political science, is a kind of social science. If history is separated from society, then the so-called history will become an empty thing, and it will have no place in the realm of science.</p>
<p>In fact, not only are many major changes in history inevitably occurring under certain social causes, but also small events in major changes, and some important figures in events, also appear under the inevitable causal relationship of social evolution. On a large scale, such as the emergence of modern capitalism, it is the result of the development and collapse of feudal society, and it is the result of the development of industry in the aging process of feudal society. On a small scale, such as the victory of a certain revolution and the success of certain figures in this revolutionary process, all have certain social reasons. Otherwise, why did the development of European industry lead to the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and even the bourgeois revolution, and not something else? Why did the French Revolution produce a figure like Napoleon but not someone like Washington? If one were to deny the inevitable causal relationship of historical changes and developments, then these historical facts would be impossible to explain.</p>
<p>Those who deny the social causality of historical changes and developments mostly exaggerate the role of individuals in history. In their view, the role of individuals in history is very great. If there were no figures like Napoleon and Washington, then the history of France and the United States would inevitably change its content. But in our view, it is not Napoleon and Washington who created the history of France and the United States, but rather the history of France and the United States that produced Napoleon and Washington. They are all figures who were inevitably produced under certain social causes. In fact, due to the outbreak of the French Revolution, the development of domestic wars, and the subsequent oppression of the revolution by the joint forces of Prussia and Austria, the French social order had already been destroyed. Under these circumstances, the emerging French bourgeoisie needed a military man with "great talent and bold strategy" to stabilize society in order to start restoring the destroyed economic organization, and thus Napoleon was produced. At the same time, in suppressing the general French people who dreamed of "freedom" and in plundering foreign lands to remedy the domestic financial emptiness, the French bourgeoisie also needed someone like Napoleon. When he set out to Italy, he wrote to the Directory saying, "I wish to collect 20 million francs from this country, which is the richest country in the world." He also said to his troops: "Your bellies are hungry, and your bodies are almost naked... I will now lead you to the most fertile plains in the world... You will see great cities, rich provinces, honor, glory, and wealth." From this, it can be seen how Napoleon catered to the needs of the French bourgeois society at that time, and made efforts to seek ways to remedy the domestic financial panic through foreign means. At the same time, the historical facts of Napoleon's trampling on Europe can also be clearly explained here. Engels once said: "It is, of course, pure accident that such and such a man arises at such and such a time in such and such a country. But if one eliminates him, there is always the need for a substitute, and this substitute is found tant bien que mal [one way or another]; in the long run he necessarily appears. That Napoleon, just that particular Corsican, was the military dictator whom the French Republic, exhausted by its own warfare, had rendered necessary, was accidental; but that, if a Napoleon had been lacking, another would have filled the place, is proved by the fact that the man was always found as soon as he became necessary." That is to say, France at that time already had the social conditions (cause) to produce a figure like Napoleon, so he became a military leader (effect); even without him, his position would inevitably be replaced by others (with a certain social cause, a certain result will inevitably be produced, and it will never fail). As for Washington, it was also produced in the American Revolution due to the development of capitalist forces in the American colonies and the "adoption of mercantilist economic policies by the British government, oppressing the industries of the American colonies, strictly implementing the Navigation Acts, and imposing extremely heavy tariffs on exported goods." Under the circumstances at that time, even without Washington, the American independence movement would still have broken out, and someone would still have come out to lead the independence movement and lead it to success. In addition, the appearance of all important figures in history can be explained by the same theory, without the need for individual analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, those who deny the necessary social causality of historical development, while exaggerating the role of individuals in history, also attach particular importance to accidental events in history. In their view, every historical fact exists independently and is not interconnected in a necessary causal relationship. Therefore, they believe that the occurrence of a major historical event is due to the promotion of many accidental opportunities. If these accidental opportunities were missing, then the occurrence of that historical event would be a big problem. In this way, they replace the entire historical law of causality with independent accidental opportunities. According to their argument, if Cao Cao had won in the Battle of Red Cliffs, then the history of the Three Kingdoms would not have been produced, and the Three Kingdoms was entirely constituted by the accidental opportunity of the victory of the Sun-Liu allied forces in the Battle of Red Cliffs. The World War I that broke out in 1914 was also due to the assassination of the Austrian Crown Prince, an accidental event. If there had been no such accidental event, then there might not have been a World War I in history. However, all accidents only have their meaning under necessity. History is developing and changing under the control of inevitable social causal relationships. Under a major social cause, a major result will inevitably be produced. In the middle, of course, some small opportunities of some form will occur to promote the realization of this result. But if some small opportunities of some form do not occur, as long as the fundamental social cause that produces a certain result exists, then it will also appear in some other small opportunities of some form. At the end of the Han Dynasty, the development of commercial capital destroyed the rural economy, causing peasant rebellions (such as the Yellow Turban Rebellion), and the feudal lords in various places took the opportunity to rise up, using the peasants to resist the central government. As a result, the authority of the central government was weakened and even eliminated, and the situation of feudal separatism appeared. The fundamental reason why the Three Kingdoms era inevitably occupies a place in Chinese history lies in this. Under this fundamental cause, even if the Cao army had won in the Battle of Red Cliffs (in fact, under the conditions at that time, the possibility of the Cao army's defeat was greater), or conversely, if the Cao army had been completely defeated and Cao Cao had been captured alive by Zhou Yu and Kong Ming, or even if there had been no figures such as Sun Quan, Cao Cao, and Liu Bei at that time, the politics at that time could not have been unified, and the records of the Three Kingdoms in Chinese history would not have become empty. As for the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it was even more the inevitable result of the development of capitalism to the stage of imperialism. Even without the assassination of the Austrian Crown Prince, the war would have broken out in another accidental event.</p>
<p>In short, the changes and development of history have a certain causality and inevitability. Therefore, we can understand the reasons for past history, and we can also use this inevitable historical law of causality to understand the present and create the future. Otherwise, everything will be unknowable.</p>
<p>Training and Cultivation</p>
<h3>Success and Failure</h3>
<p>— Guan Zhi</p>
<p>To rejoice in success and detest failure is not only common human sentiment but also a manifestation of humanity’s upward striving. As for how we can achieve success and avoid failure in the causes we admire, individual views diverge. Some advocate relying entirely on our resolute will. The saying "Yu Gong moved the mountain; where there's a will, there's a way" is a frequently heard maxim. According to this, all failures are naturally the result of us acting in the opposite manner, and failure should be attributed to a lack of determination and insufficient effort.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>This perspective, while effectively criticizing those who, due to failure, become demoralized and unable to persevere to the end, is ultimately an excessively subjective view that fundamentally fails to grasp the reasons for the success or failure of endeavors. To critique this view using philosophical terminology, it is precisely a philosophical mindset that advocates "the objective is subordinate to the subjective, consciousness determines existence, and the spirit can control reality," which is profoundly erroneous.</p>
<p>Success and failure, of course, cannot be separated from human effort; the perseverance and talent of those involved are crucial. However, we must recognize that if the objective world does not provide us with opportunities and conditions conducive to success, then regardless of how hard we try or how resolute our will and courageous our spirit, the anticipated results will not materialize. This means that if the objective social conditions do not allow us to accomplish a certain undertaking, then the result of strenuous effort will inevitably be failure rather than success. Conversely, if the objective circumstances of society have already prepared the possible conditions for the occurrence of a certain event, then even if the actions of those involved involve certain errors, causing the success of that undertaking not to belong to them or even delaying the realization of that endeavor, someone will eventually come along to complete the same cause they hoped for. In other words, this kind of success is bound to come. In short, the success or failure of an undertaking is determined by social conditions, especially regarding all undertakings related to society.</p>
<p>Human effort is not entirely unimportant, but human effort can only serve the role of a historical midwife, and must conform to and obey the trends of history, moving along the path prepared by history, in order to succeed in an undertaking. If one goes against this historical determination, then failure is inevitable. Naturally, in many situations where the possible conditions for success are the same, some people achieve success smoothly, while others fail. This seems as though it is entirely determined by human conditions. In fact, this is not the case. Because so-called smooth success is only because those engaged in this cause are better able to see the objective conditions of development and flawlessly conform to those conditions, adopting completely appropriate response strategies step by step, according to objective needs. As for why some people, under conditions conducive to success, create failure, it is because their action strategies are partially or entirely flawed and cannot adapt to historical development. This is just like a midwife; she must have a fetus in the mother's womb before she can deliver a child. Naturally, under the same conditions of impending childbirth, if there is a midwife with scientific knowledge and excellent skills, the delivery can be smooth; if there is a midwife with poor skills, she can kill the mother and baby. But no matter what, there must be a fetus to deliver a child; this is a major premise. If there is no fetus in the mother's womb at all, or it is not yet mature enough for delivery, then trying to deliver a healthy baby, regardless of whether the midwife is good or bad, can only lead to failure. Many people do not believe in this historical conclusion, and they cannot see the general trend of social development. They always attempt to reverse the course of history, making it turn backward, attempting to hold onto society and not let it move forward, even thinking that with just a resolute will and the result of hard work, they can make their ideals succeed, but this is entirely a fantasy. Even if, in objective reality, they can sometimes achieve temporary success, it is only because the driver grasping the wheels of history has made a mistake in action, temporarily creating a temporary opportunity for them, and it is not that their own ideals have the absolute possibility of realization and success. Moreover, their kind of success cannot be maintained permanently; the failure that history has cast for them will eventually come.</p>
<p>Because people like success and detest failure, common views usually evaluate heroes based on success or failure, just as the world criticizes. "The successful become kings," and people see them as kings; "the defeated become bandits," and people see them as bandits. These are both improper evaluations of success and failure. A temporarily successful undertaking is not necessarily good, and a temporarily failed undertaking is not necessarily bad. We should evaluate it from the general trend of historical development. If this success does not conform to the laws and trends of historical evolution, then this success itself will not be a success that can be permanently maintained. Behind the success is a final failure, and this success is also worthless. Conversely, if a certain failed undertaking generally conforms to the ideals of the general trend of history, then this failure is instead an opportunity for him to move towards a more correct path in the future and learn historical lessons. Therefore, future success will not only ultimately belong to him, but his temporary failure is also valuable. In this way, it can be seen that not all successful undertakings can be worshiped; only those that can adapt to the historical trend are worthy of worship. Nor can all failed undertakings be despised; if it conforms to the ideals of the trend, even if it fails temporarily, it is still worthy of worship and support. Blindly praising all successful undertakings and opposing all failed undertakings is a mistaken common view that greatly hinders human progress.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the objective conditions of society are constantly changing. Any form of success, if it is conservative and wants to maintain it permanently in a state of stagnation, then this success is the starting point of failure. If one wants to become a permanent success, one must adapt to the evolution of history and move forward. Once an undertaking is completed, one must be willing to continue to innovate it, one must be willing to abandon the solidified success that has already been achieved, and strive for new success, because history is evolving, changing its mutually adaptive conditions, that is, constantly abandoning the kind of success that has already been achieved. As long as the failure is made on the premise of progress, this failure is also a new point of success, and it can always allow us to obtain practical experience, so that we can more fully understand how to adapt to objective changes and promote the arrival of final success. In this way, it can be seen that success and failure are not absolutely opposed. If it is a conservative temporary success, then the successful person need not be optimistic and is not worthy of blind worship, because it will turn into failure in an instant. Conversely, if it is a failure caused on the premise of progress, then the failed person need not be pessimistic and does not need to be despised, because it can be transformed into ultimate success and eliminate this failure. To judge the value of the success or failure of an undertaking, to strive for success and continue to maintain that valuable success permanently, and to avoid failure and recover from failure, the most important condition is to be able to see clearly the objective historical trend, adopt appropriate adaptive strategies, obey the laws of historical evolution, and constantly innovate one's own actions.</p>
<p>A Week of Travel</p>
<h3>Yuntai Mountain</h3>
<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>Yuntai Mountain (also known as Cangwu Mountain) was originally the general name for the mountain peaks of Haizhou. It is not an independent mountain peak. To "tour Yuntai Mountain" simply refers to its most scenic areas. Its scenic spots are not limited to one place; the most worthy of visiting are: Donglei, Sucheng, Qianting, and Xugou. These four locations are quite far apart, so people who have come to visit Yuntai Mountain have generally not visited all four places, and there is no fixed route to go to each place in a specific order. Our starting point this time was Xinpu. Transportation to Qianting and Xugou is more convenient, so we climbed Qianting first.</p>
<p>Qianting is about seven or eight *li* from Xinxian, which is said to have been the old Donghai County seat. It now belongs to Guanyun and is about thirty *li* from Xinpu. Long-distance buses from Xinguo reach it directly (service began in March or April last year), and the Longhai train also stops at the foot of the mountain on the opposite side (Yanchang Station). However, to avoid the hassle of buying tickets and waiting for the bus, Mr. × booked two rickshaws the night before. The next morning, even before five o'clock, the rickshaw pullers, faithful to their livelihoods, came to urge us. We rubbed our sleepy eyes and got into the rickshaws, letting them pull us onto the Xinxu Avenue. At this time, the morning mist was thick, and we could not see the scenery along the road. The cool breeze brushed our faces, and we felt a slight chill on our bodies. However, when I thought that I, who had been exhausted by the life of official documents and correspondence, could breathe such fresh air and that famous mountains and beautiful scenery were about to enter my sight, boundless joy welled up in my heart. Before long, the sun gradually showed its smiling face, the morning mist gradually dispersed, and the famous salt fields were spread out before us, some to the east and some to the west. Some salt fields already had salt piles arranged in rows, while others were being irrigated. The salt workers were all working hard in the fields barefooted and with their legs exposed, either drawing water or scraping salt (one or two days after irrigation, the salt has already settled, and a portion of the clear water is released, while the rest is allowed to evaporate. The salt workers then use wooden rakes to scrape the salt into many small piles).</p>
<p>Around eight o'clock, we arrived at Xinxian, which is a dilapidated ancient city with narrow streets and small houses, really unworthy of mention. However, its location, with its back against the mountain and facing the mountain peaks, does have some tranquility. We only rested there for a while before walking to our destination. Walking along the country path, we passed through two villages, one large and one small. There were few houses along the way, and most houses were surrounded by stone walls. The slightly larger courtyards also had watchtowers standing tall. It is said that the first village we passed was called Xiaocun (Small Village), and the latter was called Dacun (Large Village, originally named Dayi Village, also known as Mian Village). In the past, a Mr. Jin Chong passed by here and composed a poem: "The wind sweeps away the clouds, the moon reveals the dewy traces, the stone sword beside the road darkly suggests a door. The sedan chair is as stable as a Wu boat, all the way watching the mountains to Duicun." There are indeed many mountain peaks in this area, but the "sedan chair" was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps it has been "negated" by rickshaws and foreign cars.</p>
<p>Leaving Dacun, we followed a winding mountain road. Looking up at the highest mountain peak, it resembled a pagoda. Mr. ×, being a "knowing old horse," familiarly led me up the first Heavenly Gate (this is the first passage to climb the mountain, hence the name First Heavenly Gate) and through the Eighteen Bends. The Eighteen Bends do not seem very high, but they have eighteen turns, making them feel quite strenuous. Fortunately, ahead is a small ridge, where the road is a little flatter, and we can leisurely take a breath. The soil on the ridge is bluish-green, with occasional protrusions of soil like bamboo nodes, hence the name Bamboo Node Ridge. After walking about five or six *li*, we looked up to see towering trees and a gate standing tall, which is the Southern Heavenly Gate. The road became increasingly narrow, and strange rocks were embedded in the cliffs in a staggered manner. Walking on the road, we naturally felt fear in our hearts, and our pace naturally slowed down, as if we had really arrived at the Heavenly Gate in the sky. We bent our bodies slightly, climbing over the stones and small trees, slowly ascending. At this time, we did not know whether we felt sweet or bitter, but the "touring spirit" had temporarily dissipated. Upon reaching the Heavenly Gate, we looked down at the mountains below as if they were paying homage with their hands folded. The solemnity of Qianting and its position of being admired probably lies in this point. The terrain is high in the middle and low in the east and west. To the west is Bamboo Node Ridge and Incense Burner Peak, and to the south is Peacock Gully. From afar, Mount Qu, Mount Da Yi, and Mount Yi Lu look like a row of screens. The San Yuan Palace is looming in the sky, like a mirage. Visitors who come here cannot help but gasp for breath. Fortunately, there is a temple in front where we can rest. The temple is called Wuan Palace. The year of its construction is no longer traceable. It is said to have been rebuilt by Liu Lang, the magistrate of Shuyang. However, the walls are still dim, and the signs are already old. On the plaque in front of the gate are the four characters "Gao Zhen Nan Tian" (High Garrison of the Southern Sky), and on both sides are couplets written by Tao Shu: "Righteousness pervades the sky, pointing to the White Clouds to open the path of enlightenment; Majestic voice travels across the sea, relying on bare hands to stem the torrent." (Tao Shu, style name Zilin, was a *jinshi* of the Jiaqing era and served as Governor-General of Liangjiang during the Daoguang era. He was posthumously given the title Weny). At the upper end behind the temple is a stone gate where one can sit or lie down. The autumn wind is gentle, and one feels refreshed in body and mind, hence the name Wind Gate. From here to the Nine Dragon Bridge, the winding stone path spirals downwards, becoming narrower and narrower, gradually approaching the bottom of the cauldron. When we got there, we could no longer see the bottom of the mountain, as if it were the lowest place in the world. The Nine Dragon Bridge is also known as the Longevity Bridge. The bridge itself is very large and has the Nine Dragon General Temple on it. It was rebuilt in the sixteenth year of Daoguang and is now inhabited by more than a dozen monks. Every time the temple fair starts in the first month, the incense is very prosperous, and the monks rely on the donations of the benefactors at that time to maintain their expenses for the year. We rested in the temple for a while, and the servants brought tea. After eating the biscuits we had brought, we gave one yuan as a tea fee. Then, gathering our strength, we climbed up the Qingfeng Peak (i.e., the Qianting) along the stone steps, following the Twenty-Four Solar Terms and ascending seventy-four levels to the highest point. At this time, looking down at the Southern Heavenly Gate, the green pines and cypresses are like auspicious clouds of mist, and we ourselves suspected that we were no longer in the human world.</p>
<p>Qingfeng Peak is the main peak of Yuntai Mountain. Tang Boyuan of the Ming Dynasty said in "A Record of Touring Qingfeng Peak": "The mountains surrounding the East Sea number in the thousands, and Qingfeng Peak is the head of them. From its high point, the sun can be seen when the rooster crows. This is called Qingfeng, vulgarly known as Qingfeng, which is a mistake. The coastal areas in autumn and winter see the grass wither and the trees lose their leaves, but this mountain alone resides among the green hills, extending for miles, all with lush forests and tall bamboos, evergreen throughout the four seasons. Moreover, the seven springs at the top are fertile, and everywhere the shoes are wet, the grass is as moist as early summer. The top has many giant stones, producing ten-thousand-year pines, which become more beautiful after frost. This is called Qingfeng." As the record says, this place is truly a paradise. But in my opinion, the forests are not "lush," nor are the bamboos "tall." However, because the mountain is high and the shadows are strangely prominent, and there are sparse trees to decorate it, in this dust-flying sub-northern region (Huaibei), it is naturally considered a beautiful scenic spot. To be honest, if this kind of mountain shape were combined with the "warbling birds and growing grass, miscellaneous flowers and trees" of the Jiangnan region, that would truly be a "Shangri-La"!</p>
<p>"Gu Zhi" records: "This mountain was originally named Qingfeng Peak. Because the San Yuan Sacred Temple was built, it was named Yuntai. According to Fang Yu, it is Cangwu Mountain in the sea." From this, it can be known that although Yuntai Mountain is the general name of the mountains in the East Sea, Qingfeng Peak (i.e., Qianting) is the real Yuntai Mountain. The Yuntai that the locals speak of refers specifically to this place.</p>
<p>In front of Qingfeng Peak is Incense Burner Peak, and behind it is Golden Bull Peak (commonly called the Back Peak. Legend has it that the two masters Golden Bull practiced here, hence the name). The mountain peaks are connected, separated by no more than two *guo*. It is said that Qingfeng Peak is 700 meters high, and Golden Bull Peak is 750 meters high. It seems that Golden Bull Peak is higher, but because it cannot match the scenery of Qingfeng Peak, it is not given much attention. We came to Golden Bull Peak simply to climb the mountain and reach its summit, and also with the intention of "in for a penny, in for a pound." There was originally a building on Golden Bull Peak called Hai Shu, also known as Wang Ri, which was first built during the Wanli era. During the Qianlong era, Cheng 鐅 of Jiangdu had a line: "The tall building with its unique banner is now rubble, and the remaining stele has no words and is already covered with moss." It can be known that this building has been dilapidated for a long time. What can be viewed now is only a Golden Bull Cave, but it is blocked by spiderwebs, and it is dark inside, with nothing to see. However, Golden Bull Peak is ultimately the highest point of Yuntai Mountain. Standing on the top and looking at the surrounding area, villages and fields are all taken into the eyes. If it is in the morning, you can also see the beautiful sunrise!</p>
<p>Finally, we turned back from Golden Bull Peak to Qingfeng Peak and headed towards San Yuan Palace. This temple has been rebuilt several times. It is said to have been founded in the seventh year of Emperor Renzong's Huangyou era in the Song Dynasty. In the fifteenth year of Emperor Shenzong's Wanli era in the Ming Dynasty, Xie Chun of Shanyang destroyed his home and built it alone, which took ten years to complete. It was rebuilt again in the sixteenth year of the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty, and then repeatedly rebuilt during the Jiaqing and Daoguang eras. There were also imperial plaques and the grand occasion of the emperor ordering guards to offer incense, which shows that the history of this temple is very glorious and noble. However, it is still dilapidated, and the statues of the gods are about to collapse. Now, no one comes to repair and renovate it, as if the Bodhisattva is also having bad luck. Behind the San Yuan Hall is the Water Curtain Cave, where spring water flows out slowly, like a thin pearl curtain, which adds a lot of color to the San Yuan Palace. A little to the east is also Huayan Cave, where the waterfall outside the cave serves as a natural pearl curtain, with steep cliffs on all sides, which is a work of ghostly craftsmanship. It is said that the cave is very wide, and in the summer, venturing in through the water is as cool as being in a refrigerator.</p>
<p>There are many famous scenic spots near San Yuan Palace. To the southeast are the Natural Stele, with a Line of Sky on the stele and Xiaoyun Cave and Chaoyang Stream on the side of the stele. To the southwest is Zhongle Terrace, and to the west is Pingshan Society, now named Xizhuyuan, where the servants live. However, they are mostly mediocre and ordinary. After seeing so many scenic spots, seeing this place again really does not arouse much higher interest.</p>
<p>It is said that there are many pine trees on Yunfeng, and they are very unique. The panlong of Xijian (west of Xizhuyuan)</p>

<p>Long Pine is especially known for its strangeness and antiquity. During the Northern Song Dynasty, it was already called a relic of the Three Dynasties. However, in the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu, a real person came here to offer incense and inadvertently inserted incense into the holes of the pine tree. Because it was old and dry, it was easy to catch fire. Thus, the long-lived Panlong was given a funeral by fire! Now, only a few sparse ten-thousand-year pines remain!</p>
<p>After visiting the various scenic spots, one cannot help but have some thoughts: Yuntai Mountain is indeed a good place; the surrounding environment and its own unique shape make it a "famous mountain and scenic spot." Unfortunately, due to the long years, it has gradually become old and haggard. Many of the scenic spots of the past have largely tended to be obliterated!</p>

<h3>Armed Africa</h3>
<p>— Baosen</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital Correspondence</p>
<p>Currently, while there are also many white and brown people in Africa, the majority of its residents are black people. Therefore, if we only superficially consider the quantity of people, then Africa can be said to be the Africa of black people. However, the reality is quite the opposite; most of the land in Africa has long been divided by European powers. Although there are still a few independent countries existing on the surface, the real power of their politics and economy is still in the hands of European and American powers. The phrase "Africa of black people" only has a little meaning in form and appearance; according to the actual situation, it should be said to be the Africa of white people (more accurately, it should be the Africa of European and American powers).</p>
<p>Before the Great War, countries like Britain, France, Germany, and Italy all had many colonies in Africa. Although Germany's African territories were lost later, these places did not become independent countries as a result, but were transferred to countries like Britain and France. Here is a table listing the area and population of all three independent countries in Africa and the territories of the major powers:</p>
<p>According to the table above, we can see that the three independent countries in Africa, whether in terms of population or land area, are not as large as those possessed by any one of Britain or France. This fact clearly shows that the vast majority of black people in Africa are still directly ruled and enslaved by the major powers. Strictly speaking, it can even be said that the entire African black population and their territories are under the control of European and American powers because although Africa has three nominally independent countries, they are controlled by European and American powers in all aspects.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the actual situation of the three independent countries in Africa. First, Abyssinia is being fought over by Britain, France, and Italy. The current urgent situation in East Africa precisely demonstrates the acute conflict between Britain, France, Italy, and other countries in Abyssinia. It is also the time for Abyssinia and even all African blacks to decide their own destiny: this is known to everyone. Second, although Egypt was recognized by Britain as an independent kingdom in 1922, it has not actually escaped the shackles of the British. As for Liberia, it is the only republic of black people in the world. Although it is still dominated by British and American powers in all aspects, many places are worth mentioning in particular.</p>
<p>The Republic of Liberia was established in 1847 and was formed by freed black slaves from the United States. Its political organization completely follows the model of the United States, with a president and vice president, and upper and lower houses. Education cannot be said to be very backward; the country has a total of 1780 schools, with about 67,000 students. In trade, the US dollar is the standard, but in commercial aspects, the British pound is used. In 1932, the revenue was 476,000 US dollars, and the expenditure was 635,000 US dollars, which can indicate its financial difficulties. Liberia is inextricably linked to Britain and America.</p>
<p>The capital of the world's only black republic is named Monrovia, after US President Monroe. It has a total population of 11,000 and is a trading port. Because the climate is very hot and the land is fertile, products such as rubber, coconut oil, cotton, coffee, ivory, and dyeing materials are very abundant.</p>
<p>Before the Great War, Liberia was surrounded by British and American territories, so it could not be said to have true freedom. During the war, it was placed under the sphere of influence of Germany, and even its superficial independence was almost lost. Later, with the support of the United States, it declared war on Germany, loudly proclaiming "Africa for the black people." However, Liberia did not gain any real benefits after the war, and it still could not escape the control of Britain and America in economic terms. The United States is extremely concerned about Africa because of its urgent need for raw materials such as rubber, and Liberia is an important path for it to enter Africa. Recently, although Liberians are working hard to strive for true freedom and continue to shout "Africa for the black people," they have not yet achieved great results; they must continue to work hard to achieve true liberation.</p>
<p>As for the African blacks outside of these three "independent countries," they are even more directly oppressed by European powers. When the forces of European capitalism began to invade Africa, the black society here was still in a primitive state. The white people who came here initially even regarded them as beasts, and later "mercifully" treated them as slaves. At the same time, the concept of private ownership of land was still very weak among African blacks at that time, so the "civilized" white people took the opportunity to seize their land. This was the first lesson in the practice of colonialism by the major powers. Then, they enslaved the black people, forced them to work for themselves, and inflicted various punishments on them. This situation was fully demonstrated in the Congo, in the former German territories, British territories, and French territories, especially in East Africa. However, the black people were certainly very distressed under the oppression of these "civilized people," and with the development of their knowledge, they were bound to rise up to resist and strive for independence and freedom. For example, the anti-British movements of Egyptian Muslims and South African Boers in the past, the organization of the East African Federation by Kenyans, the independence movement of the Rif people of Morocco, and the Greater Liberia movement, etc., are all heroic expressions of the African black people's spirit in seeking independence and freedom. In the process, they shed much blood and sacrificed much energy and life in order to achieve the liberation of their nation and themselves. Although they have not yet fully achieved their goals, their spirit is commendable; moreover, the blood they shed in the past was not wasted. In fact, under the threat of their heroic spirit of resistance, the powers that ruled them had to make considerable concessions in order to ease the situation. For example, Britain's granting of independence to Egypt (although it was superficial), France's change in its high-pressure policy in Morocco, and Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and others' considerable changes in their attitudes toward oppressing black people, cannot but be said to have resulted from their continuous resistance.</p>
<p>Recently, as the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia has become increasingly urgent, all African blacks are very indignant. In addition to Abyssinia, which has already fully mobilized, other countries such as Egypt, Liberia, and blacks in the territories led by Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, and Belgium have also expressed their willingness to sacrifice for their race. Even soldiers and ordinary black people in Italian territories have repeatedly raised the banner of rebellion, opposing the attack on black countries. Walter, the South African Commissioner stationed in Britain, even issued such a warning at the League of Nations meeting: "Armed Africa will eventually rise up and overthrow Europe." The South African representative, De Water, also declared: "A war of conquest will inevitably backfire one day, because forces will arise all over Africa to resist this evil!" - From this, it can be seen that the African blacks who have always been oppressed by "civilized people" are not to be underestimated.</p>

<p>Since Yamengquan went to the Arctic three times and used up all his family property for exploration, thanks to the donation of 80,000 US dollars from James, the father of Ellsworth, Yamengquan bought two planes, numbers 24 and 25. When approaching the center of the Arctic, a storm separated the two planes and forced them to land separately. Although they found each other later, one plane could not be used, and the other plane could not take off because it was parked on uneven ice. As a result, a group of adults was trapped in this inaccessible Arctic... (To be continued in the next issue)</p>

<h3>"One Bullet Released"</h3>
<p>"One Bullet Released" is a detective and love masterpiece co-starred by Stewart Granger and Virginia Bruce for the first time. The plot twists and turns are quite capable of surpassing the clichés of general detective films. It can compete with "The Thin Man", "Charlie Chan", and "Philo Vance" for the title of MGM's unsurpassed and exciting blockbuster. It is released in Nanjing today. The left is one of the tense scenes.</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhier</p>
<p>The film industry's charity entertainment party was held yesterday at the Central Western Restaurant to entertain the press.</p>
<p>After tea and refreshments, a report followed:</p>
<p>The amount raised by the previous charity entertainment party for flood relief from all walks of life was more than 30,000 yuan. Apart from those that have not yet been received, 15,000 yuan has been remitted to the disaster areas, while the various expenses of the association are probably around 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(It is hoped that all great philanthropists can save some money. This expenditure of nearly one-third is really too much because the rear is ultimately not as urgently in need of funds as the disaster area.)</p>
<p>This film industry's charity entertainment party, in addition to Peking opera, drama, songs, and film meals, also features star dancing. The method for star dancing is ten yuan per dance. However, this ten yuan per dance also requires luck. The "great philanthropist" "donates" ten yuan, and the association gives him the "right" to spin a turntable once. Whoever it lands on will dance with that person. This kind of "fair trade" is said to have been devised to avoid making the red stars too tired. (According to news from a certain source: It is also possible to specify which red stars to dance with, but the price is 100 yuan per dance.)</p>
<p>In addition to star dancing (the time is from 10:00 PM to 2:00 AM), 45 dancers were borrowed from the nine major dance halls before 10:00 PM. The price? One yuan per dance. (Compared with the female stars, the ratio is ten to one. In other words, the value of female stars is ten times higher than that of dancers.)</p>
<p>Finished.</p>
<p>Someone said: I propose that Hu Die and other red stars be nationalized and implement the "wife of the Republic of China" method. Tickets may as well be bought for 100 yuan each, or even more expensive. The numbers may as well be changed to 1 million or 5 million. In this way, the great flood of the 24th year can be saved by relying on the power of stars.</p>
<p>After the news of Hu Die and others dancing was released, some poor young men who were "Hu Die fans" or "Xu Lai fans" planned to draw lots first by using the method of accumulating sand to form a pagoda, and then the winner would act as a "great philanthropist" to try his luck on a spin.</p>
<p>Someone predicted: The female stars of Diantong and Lianhua companies will not participate in star dancing, and Hu Die is afraid that she will not participate either, but Chen Yumei is in Shanghai, and she will definitely participate without a doubt, even if this gentleman cannot dance, he will definitely go to some dance school for a crash course.</p>
