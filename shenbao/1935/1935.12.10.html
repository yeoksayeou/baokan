<h3 id="c16">救濟漁業問題 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 違</p>
<p>吾國沿海漁區。據近年科學上之探測。約有二十七萬一千八百零五方浬。為優秀漁塲。設能順利　發。漁產前途實無限量。乃近年以外魚傾銷。外輪侵漁之故。吾國漁業竟瀕破產之境。今夏以來。各省漁區狀况。尤屬滿目凄凉。處定海沈家門一帶原有漁船千艘以上。而近屆冬汛漁期。出漁者不及三分之一。滸浦嵊山乍浦等處原屬著名漁村。今則外村漁船。旣無一前往。卽本村之出漁船數。亦寥寥無幾。較諸以往之魚販塞途。檣桅林立。實不可同日而語。此就漁民而言也。至握漁產運銷樞紐之冰鮮魚船。則以消費地購買力銳减。魚價慘落。而今春大都遭受虧折之故。無力者固停止經營。有欵者亦縮小範團。船數遂降落至半數以上。上海魚行營　。尤一落千丈。倒閉者已有多家。秋初魚行結賬期問。更大批裁去員司數百人。受影響者當不止千數。此就魚商而言也。吾國漁業。危殆若此。政府當局誠宜從經濟方面。妥為救濟。但此外更應注意者尙有兩點。</p>
<p>其一。吾國沿海一帶。常有侵漁之外輪。憑其進步之技術。搜索漁利。無微不至。吾國技術幼稚之漁船難與競爭。此等外國漁輪有時且深入吾各處港灣。對於國防。亦有至深之影響。此則為保全漁權計。望政府當局用外交手續。加以取締者。</p>
<p>其二。沿海漁民。聚處各島。自成村落。卽當漁汛。亦鮮至城鎭。而行政官吏。對於漁村管理。及漁民敎育。大都忽視過甚。因而文化落後。漁民技術亦永不能進步。故沿海漁政在今日實至切要。此亦望政府當局加以注意者。</p>

<p>（倫敦）海軍會議為戰後最重要會議之一、今晨十時半在英外部洛迦諾室開幕、首由英相鮑爾溫致詞歡迎各國代表、並說明英國地位、旋出會塲、與代理外相艾登會商足見意阿時局之嚴重、美代表台維斯繼英相而發言、解釋美國之態度、日代表永野繼起致詞、其他發言者為澳代表白魯斯·加拿大代表梅謝·法代表柯爾平·印度代表白特勒·南愛代表杜倫蒂·意代表格蘭第·紐絲綸代表巴爾·與南非代表華特、各國代表團出席開幕會議者各十二人、發言時間以五分鐘為限、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍會議今日開幕、美國主張海軍力裁减二成、英國主張限　潛水艦、日本要求平等、法意則反對訂立長期協定、美國堅不允日平等故會議勢必卽成僵局、今日會議於各國代表演說後、卽於上午十一時四十五分休會、明晨十時三十分再開、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）據消息靈通各界聲稱、日本似可贊同英首相鮑爾溫在海軍開幕演說中所提出締結妄用潛艇恊定之建議、惟日本將堅决反對羅總統致其總代表台維斯函中所主减少海軍總噸位百分之二十之建議、並將反對潛艇質與量的縮减、如英美主力艦與飛機母艦不能商妥龐大之質與量的縮减、則日本或尙將要求增加噸位七萬八千噸云、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）九日舉行之海軍軍縮會議、劈頭由英國首相鮑爾溫演說、其內容之骨子現已由英國政府向外務省內示矣、其口腔雖極穩健、但希望繼續華府條約之主旨、依照互讓之精神成立海軍軍備一般之協定、提唱完全廢除或極力减少濟水艦、尤對於萬一恊定不成立之際、則主張實施各種兵艦之質的限制、特別注重此點、頗為一般所注目、據此情形觀察之、則英國對於此次會議之態度、並未與預備交涉以來發見其任何進步、亦未產生任何新意義、而與日本政府之主張相距尙遠、是以該項會議其前途、當不無多大難關也、（九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）英國提案之一部、所謂廢除潛水艦或禁止濫用、對於訂立此項恊定之問題、日本海軍發表見解、茲錄其大要如下、潛水艦曾經日內瓦普通軍縮會議大多數代表認為係防禦上之武器、而夫含有攻撃上之性質、且其他各國之同種兵力與相對關係極其薄弱、是以各國因其防禦上之立塲及其地理上之地位若何、認為係防禦上必須之兵力、尤以日本之立塲、更為必要、故對於廢除潛水艦問題、不得不斷然反對、至於禁止濫用之協定、當屬另一問題也云云、（九日日聯電）</p>
<h3 id="c41">各國代表演說 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）各代表演說大旨如下，英首相鮑爾溫謂英國地位已於一九三二年軍縮大會中詳細說明、迄今未變、英政府現仍準備延長華盛頓與倫敦海軍條約之原則、而加以必要之修正、以適應國際形勢之變更、與各個國之需要、今之會議、有兩重義務、卽繼續以前會議之工作與竭力避免無限制的海軍競爭之復作是也英政府極重視質的與量的限制之賡續、願見大艦與大砲型式之减小、更願見潛艇之廢除、如國際對此能獲妥協、則將來世界海軍建築經費定可大减云、、</p>
<p>英相繼謂、初步談話甚有價值、各國現能了解彼此之特殊問題與困難、吾人宜協定若干限制、庶一方面可使各國有應付其特殊需要之餘地、一方面可解除世人所抱海軍競爭之恐惶、此乃甚關重要者、海軍競爭中費用最大、而危險亦最甚者、厥為各國在軍艦新形式上各欲爭勝之願望、至於潛艇問題、如不能獲有廢除之同意、則不可不有防其濫用之恊定、法意兩國政府可接受倫敦海軍條約關於戰時潛艇待遇商船之條文、査此條文早為美日兩國所接受、故渠希望無限制的潛艇戰爭今後當可免矣、雖有若干代表對於華盛頓與倫敦條約之若干條文、或不贊同、但事有末可否認者、過去十四年中迄未有如從前妨害邦交之造艦競爭精神也、渠確信如各國準備在其要求中稍予讓步、以謀公共福利、則不獨縮减噸數且增進世人安全觀念之協定、不難締成云、（九日路透）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦海軍會議美國代表團主席台維斯今日向赴會代表演說、聲稱美國不擬首倡海軍競爭、並云「吾人不欲增加海軍、惟願限　及减縮、目前吾人之建造程序、大部份　補換舊艦、與此願望亦相符合、美國停造軍艦已及十年卽就　在之建造計劃而言、倫敦條約所准許於一九三六年底應有之實力、亦須至一九四二年始能達到、吾人並不希望超過此項條約限制」云、</p>
<p>台氏演說前、曾先讀十四個月前羅斯福函件一通、總統於該函中力稱美國不欲作任何海軍競爭、惟望現有之海軍條約能繼續有效、並謂「華盛頓會議、實為人類文明進步之碑石、其後倫敦條約、亦承認此種良好之工作、應加以促進、而海軍之减縮、應更謀擴大範圍、華府及倫敦二約、現在已不僅為一種數學之公式、　所規定之比率、以各國國防之比較需要為根據、各國之主要利益、並無犧牲、而海軍强國之相互間的安全、亦並無損害、倘此等條約一日廢止、則相互間的安全之原則、將完全失其平衡、而將引起海軍建造之競爭、結果如何、實難預料」云、台氏復謂、欲達限制國際海軍競爭之目的、修改現有條約亦為一法、否則應竭力設法、以坦白友好之態度、交換意見、俾可覓得互相諒解之途徑、以為日後成立更為永久更為廣泛的條約之基礎云、（九日國民社電）</p>

<p>（一）以紅海海口一處、給與阿國自由通航、該海口或將為意屬伊里特里之阿薩勃港、如意國不允割讓則英國可考慮以英屬索謀里蘭之才拉港作為阿國出海口、</p>

<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<p>勞資調協（續）　朱通九</p>
<p>四，一般勞資調恊的方法勞資調協的方法有三：</p>
<p>（一）調停（Couciliation）調停者，當勞資爭議將發生或已發生時，由善意的第三者或政府代表，後中斡旋，使兩方意見接近，而訂立一種團體契約之謂也。按調停又分二種：</p>
<p>A、預防調停預防調停的意義，係在勞資　議醞釀之時，勞資雙方威情，將近破裂，而勞資　方衝突的行為，尙未表示。此時第二者已知勞資雙方，各持成見，最後必至發生衝突，遂出而任居間為善意的調停，使雙方讓步，以消弭禍患於無形。按此種調停，在雙方戚情未破壞　前，容易着手，並易於成功，謂之預防調停。</p>
<p>B、事後調停事後調停，係指勞資兩方，業已發生爭議而言，按勞資爭議發生以後，形勢嚴重，一面宣吿罷工或預謀暴動，一面借助軍警的力量，預備鈸壓，流血的慘禍，勢所難免。此時第三者不忍勞資雙方的惡鬥，影響及於社會的　安，遂出而邀集雙方當事者，作排難解紛的集議。然事後調停，又分任意調停與强制調停二項：</p>
<p>甲，任意調停任意調停，係勞資雙方，是否願意接受調停，悉聽雙方自决，無拘束能力。設勞資雙方的任何一方，不願接受調停，則調停之效力遽失。任意調停中，又有所謂消極的調停與積極的調停者，消極的調停，如調停機關，雖已組織，而雙方是否願意利用，悉聽當事者雙方之尊便。如一八九二年法國之調停法規，卽如是規定。至於積極的調停，則由地方官吏，負責勸吿，使雙方各秉和平之宗旨，而不相堅持成見。但無强迫雙方接受之權。</p>
<p>乙，强制調停强制調停，與任意調停不同，凡政府代表地方官吏出任調停之後，雙方必須容納調停意見，否則國家出而强制執行，如瑞典等調停法規，卽如是規定。</p>
<p>（二）審議（Investigatiev）審議的意義，係政府機關或審議庭對於勞資爭議，舉行澈底的調査，幷將各種事實，官佈於大衆之前，使社會瞭解爭議的眞相，而有具體的及有力的公意表示。設社會公意對於勞方　資方不滿，使勞方或資方自己覺悟，自願撤回爭議，而就和平，此卽所謂引用社會的制裁，而弭止社會的糾紛。但審議制度，效力極微，故事實上採用者較少。</p>
<p>（三）仲裁（Arbitration）仲裁具有公斷性質。各國因上述二種方法，不易收效，設立仲裁機關，以處理勞資爭議。但習慣上各國先調停着手。如一旦調停失敗？卽以仲裁繼之。故仲裁機關不啻為勞資調解的最高法庭。按仲裁亦分任意仲裁與强制伸裁二種。任意仲裁係出勞資兩方的同意，始得出而仲裁。且裁判結果，並無强制雙方必須遵守之權。故任意仲裁，不若強制仲裁收效之大。蓋因强制仲裁，以國家所頒布之法律為根據，至一經判决，雙方必須遵守，否則予以嚴厲的處罰。</p>
<p>五，我國勞資爭議處理法的變更我國對於勞資爭議，根據民國十七年國民政府所頒布之第一次勞資爭議處理法，探用强制仲裁制度。至民國十九年三月，立法院加以修正，改為任意仲裁。但改為任意仲裁之後，仲裁判决，法律上缺乏强制能力，不能拘束勞資雙方接受判决。故當一二八滬戰以後，滬上工潮澎湃，因任意仲裁關係，勞資糾紛，一時不易解决，社會頗受影響。如三友實業社之勞資糾紛，擾攘經年，由調停而仲裁，由仲裁而引起法庭訴訟，遷延不决，　方損失極鉅。上海市市長吳鐵城有鑒於此，遂向中央政治會議提議恢，復强制仲裁，後由立法院將勞資爭議處理法修改，恢復昔日之强制仲裁制度。故我國對於勞資糾紛的法律，業已一再變更，但以事實關係，威覺强制仲裁，實較任意仲裁為有效。</p>
<p>至於强制仲裁之要點，可分為五：（一）勞資爭議調解無結果後，必須提付仲裁。（二）瞪人必須作證並提出瞪書。（三）調解瞪據及進行裁定時，禁止關廠及罷工。（四）仲裁必須裁定及公布。（五）裁定必須執行，不得聲明異議。並在有效期間，禁止關廠及罷工，違者處　罰金或監禁</p>
<p>自恢復强制仲裁制度以後，滬十勞資糾紛，確比以前减少，於此可知强制伸裁之效力，實較任意仲裁為大。筆者個人夙昔主張政府採用強制仲裁，卽因政府可以施行其統制權，以消滅勞資糾紛於無形中也。</p>
<p>六，意大利之勞資爭議處理法各國勞資爭議處理法中，以意大利之法律最為嚴厲。對於罷工與關廠，一概均在禁止之列。所有一切勞資糾紛，悉由勞庭法定裁決。施行以後，效力顯著，成續極佳，特介紹於後，俾供國人參考，幷作本文結束。</p>
<p>一九二六年四月三日意大利政府所公佈之法律，規定凡無故關閉工廠，以强迫工人接受較集合契約所規定者為低的條件時，政府將處僱主一萬至十萬里拉的罰金。同時如以罷工手段，以求達較合同所定尤高的條件，政府亦處工人以一百至一千里拉之罰金。而罷工領袖，除納罰金外，猶須監禁一年或二年。且意大利政府對於罷工的定義，非常嚴格。凡三人以上停止工作而要求僱主給予超過合同以外之待遇，均視為罷工。</p>
<p>公共機關的工人！如郵電工人等！如無故罷工，應受一月或六月之監禁，並停止工作六個月、罷工領袖，則應受六月或二年之監禁，並停止工作三年以上。至於公共事業性質的僱主，如無故關閉工廠，應繳九千至十萬里拉的罰金，並受六月或一年之監禁。</p>
<p>意大利政府不但禁止經濟性質之罷工，幷且禁止政治性質之罷工。因政治性質之罷工，足以損害政府之威信。故對於參加此項性質之罷工者，處罰尤嚴。規定凡參加罷工者，悉處以一年或三年之監禁。鼓動此項罷工者，處以三年或七年之監禁，並且永久剝奪　作工之權利。</p>

<p>虹口東有恒路五號門牌興華汽車公司、開設迄今、已有年所、昨晨九時一刻、忽來衣冠楚楚年約三旬左右之少年顧客一人、自稱宋姓、逕至該公司帳房間、云須租車一輛、至法租界及外灘等處、迎接親友、</p>
<p>停於弄口</p>
<p>該公司帳房、卽將租單簽就、交與值班之汽車夫徐桂林、開出租界第一七六九四號（華界第四四六五號）汽車一輛、該顧客乃從容登車、汽車卽向法租界方面疾馳而去、迨車抵福履理路福開森路口、該顧客卽命車夫將車停於該處附近一弄口、</p>
<p>布旗禮幛</p>
<p>乃車方煞停、而弄口已有兩人預先佇候該處、二人手中、一執捲就布旗一面、　携形似贈送禮幛裝置金字約尺許方式之紙盒一只、兩人相繼登車、三人並肩而坐、復命車夫將車開至五馬路四川路　比抵該處在後上車兩人、卽相率徒手下車、布旗與紙盒、卽留置於車內</p>

<p>「放你的頭在我的膝上，我會拿我的裙子來蓋着你；我是不怕黑夜的，」∶南恩說道，獨自坐着，勉自相信她是不介意於一切的陰影以及四周怪異的聲息。</p>
<p>『等她來了呌醒我，」羅勃說道，不到五分鐘他已埋頭在南恩的圍裙之下，深深睡熱了。</p>
<p>那小姑娘又獨自坐了一刻鐘，以急切的神色環矚她的四周，覺得每一秒鐘不啻如一小時，忽然一點淡白的微光從山項上閃耀了出來、她就自言自語道：</p>

<p>協興勝滬江（甲）　恊興自擊敗麥令後、令人括目相看、隊員個個修長出色、確為華人球隊中之優秀隊伍、滬江實力、原非昔比、但少年氣壯、英勇勃發、個個有活潑美麗之技術、不甘示弱、與協興極力抵衡、打開極動人之局面、獲得光榮之戰績、雖不幸而敗、亦敗得輝煌、中鋒黃立富、每戰必獲得最高之得分紀錄、實今年上海籃球界之一位新進英雄、</p>
<p>開始即在相持不下之局面中、黃立當開紀錄之端、張綿祥立　還數、此後堅持各無建樹者甚久、恊興忽然得手、丘廣燮恃其打排球之跳躍手段、在籃前連得三球、黎連澤錦上添花、以十二比二遙領前導、</p>
<p>滬江奮發有為、氣燄囂張、攻破協興之壁壘、黃立富周褒屢建奇功、黃立强戴定國嚴密戒備陣容緊凑、生氣勃勃、不久、反以十五比十四嶄露頭角、朱培生又加三分、以十八比十四誇耀一時、</p>
<p>恊興周達雲追上二分後、局勢仍無起色、乃將陳宗祺調翁仁安、力圖反攻、但滬江聲勢旺盛、不可一世、協興始終在被壓迫之惡劣環境中、戴定國造成二十二比十六、周達雲張錦祥　發進取、在極熱烈之形勢下、黎連澤造成二十二比二十二之平手、霎時間、滬江朱培生於一分鐘內、又連中鵠、上半時終了、滬江二十六分、協與二十四分、</p>
<p>下半時情形益為緊張、協興周張促成二十九之等數、滬江英勇氣概、仍不稍衰、一度又以卅六比卅一佔先、而戴黃二君福至心靈、神投妙射、立成四十比三十三極盛一時、</p>
<p>但自此以後、協興氣勢忽震、周達雲聯珠發射、屢屢中的、又成四十比四十、協興調上沈宗敎、代替黎連澤、此人身體肥碩、奔跑蹣跚如鵝、詎人不可貌相、亦各有其命運、投籃極佳、必擲必中、協興賴其宗敎神威、果然局勢一新、自此一帆風順、無往不利、卒以五十二比四十五、保持常勝榮譽、</p>

<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>意大利的兵士把毒瓦期介紹到進攻阿比西尼亞的戰爭中去，但是阿比西尼亞人自己也有不少強烈性的毒物，可以作交換品，在作用和效力上講，他們的毒物比毒瓦斯更加利害哩。阿比西尼亞的部落人民可以從仙人掌以及其他的植物中，取出汁來，釀造一種烈性毒物。他們能够把這種毒物放在水穴中，使深入內地的敵兵喝了中毒。</p>
<p>有一位住在阿狄斯、阿巴巴（阿國的京城）的阿國化學家對於致命的灌木毒物，知道得最詳細。他曾把各種毒物記載出來，列成一張阿比西尼亞毒物表，內中有許多毒物都從別處人士所不大熟悉的植物所製成的。例如有一種毒物叫做「恩加勃落比」，是粉末狀的東西，從「恩加勃落比」灌木的乾根所做成的。假使把這種毒粉混在烟草中，吸烟的人吸了，噴到第二口或三口烟的時候，就要中毒而亡。還有幾種植物的球莖和果實，可以供給毒汁出來。假使把這種毒汁混在啤酒或煮肉中，不知道的人吃了就要受着相當的苦楚，甚至喪掉性命。</p>
<p>最最可怕的毒物，是得之於七星燭事形的仙人掌樹的乳狀汁。士人把這種毒汁傾在池沼裏，在半小時以內，池沼裏所有的魚類，都浮到水面上來喘息了。不過有一點令人驚駭不止難以了解的，就是士人把浮在水面上喘息的魚，捉來吃了絕對不會中毒的。傾過這種毒汁的池沼裏，毒性是永遠存在的，其毒可知。曾有一土人不知道池沼裏在前幾天傾過毒汁來捕魚吃的，他把水潑在面上洗面，旁邊的同伴連忙喊住他，已經來不及了，他的手上面上頸上臂上都潑着了水，不到二十分鐘，潑着水的皮膚上就起了一大片的細水泡。他的眼睛閉攏了，一種痛苦的情狀，令人害怕。同伴連忙把淸水來替他洗滌，他的眼睛已經受看損傷，足足瞎了一星期多。所以在意大利兵士渡過瑪萊勃河攻入內地的時候，發見每前進一英里，在工作方面加重一層困難。</p>

<p>— 張夢飛</p>
<p>南翔北市有一座楊王廟，建造得很是莊嚴，內中塑着一尊黑面的楊王，十分威武，每年到了中元節的一天，各處的船帮都要來迎神賽會，非常熱鬧，這也算是一年一度，相傳到現在已經要幾十年了，因為楊王是向來保佑他們順風順水，所以他們很是信仰與敬重可是今年春節起頭，廟裏又多了一批意外的香火，就是上海一輩北里中人，每逢陰曆的朔望日，大家很高興的趁着火車來燒香，弄得一部滬翔區間車中，祗聽一片鶯鶯燕燕的嘈雜聲音，據伊們說現在上海的某廟不靈了，南翔的楊王却是大靈特靈，燒了一次香，一定會有相當的收入，所以大家都很誠心的來燒香。</p>
<p>燒香的花費原是很大的，尤其是一般妓女！捐些燈油愿，十元五元原本沒什麽希罕，祗要冥冥中保得伊們多接着一位大客人，瘟生—寃桶—。</p>
<p>有的人說，楊王今年交了桃花運了—燒香的都是一輩年靑美貌的姑娘們，我聽了連說不……不……不……你弄錯了，你可知道妓女們為甚麽要到楊王那裏燒香？那一尊神像豈不是黑面孔嗎？這很明白地可以懂得，就是一般小白臉不肯化錢，還是多來幾個像楊王那樣的人吧。</p>
<p>香燭舖子，妓女們倒也很是迷信，有一家天福，伊們說天賜福氣，口彩很好，所以香燭的生竟很是興旺，有一家五昌，據說昌字是瘡字的諧音，伊們怕要生瘡，便不願去購買，呵呵，這也算是有幸有不幸了。</p>

<p>— 宛廬</p>
<p>我們東方的藝術，向來是呌西洋人見而昨舌的！楮葉，核舟，流傳已久，從前的絕技，姑且不去說它，也說不了那末多，現在單就我個人看見過的東西來談談，也就够歎為觀止的了！</p>
<p>第一，是一隻象牙翻戒：蠶豆大的一粒象牙翻戒上一面：方方正正地刻了一篇前赤壁賦，祇隱約看得出一條條黑綫，拿幾倍的放大鏡看起來，却是一筆不苟的蘇帖，筆鋒波折，無不維妙維肖。一面：刻了一幅蘇東坡夜遊赤壁圖，內服雖然可以看得出是一幅山水，但是在放大鏡下，它的層次用筆，却的確是三王的畫法，欵識是「于嘯軒作於京師」幾個字，這位于君，在民四五年，還在北平，所以欣賞他的藝術的人很多，後來雖然也很有幾位可以仿效他的，但是細微處已略遜一籌，筆法之工，更不免有上下床之別。這不能不算是一椿絕技？</p>
<p>第二，是民八的時候，我在上海愛儷園主人歐司愛哈同的席上，看見過的一枝銀杖：這枝銀杖，長約二寸，杖柄係一粒黃色的殼壳嵌鑲的，依着殼壳的裂紋，後天然的界劃，上面寫了幾行黑字，全文記不淸楚了；大致是：叙述某年某省迺著旱災，蒙歐司愛哈同先生，慨指若干鉅欵，振濟災民，義粟仁漿，存活無算，用表謝忱……等語，下欵是××義賑會敬贈，字體也很有家數。比之于囒軒之雕刻象牙，固然字跡稍大，但是也要用放大鏡才能辨認，而且于刻是刀鐫而它是用畢筆寫的，什麽筆毫，能寫這末細微的字呢？而且是寫在毛楞楞殼壳上呀！可惜這位寫字的人，沒有題名。</p>
<p>第三，是我在內地得著過的一粒扇墜：北平古物陳列所，有一付田黃凍的石章，一共三方，就用本身的材料，琢成三條細練，連在一起，大家看了，都很驚奇，認為是鬼斧神工了。，我親手在安徽內地，得著過一個象牙的扇墜，是一個小葫蘆，全體像一粒白玉小花生，表面刻了些欵識和花紋；買回來之後，有一天想把它擦擦干凈，無意中，把葫蘆的上半截旋脫了，隨手從葫蘆裏面，扯出一條三寸多長的練條來，稀奇更稀奇！練條上墜着四件小玩意；一件是蜂巢，上面還叮着幾隻蜂子，一件是花籃，上面還挿着兩朶枝葉齊全的牡丹花，一件是一隻爵杯，刻着鐘鼎的花紋，一件是小印，還刻着四個端端正正的朱文篆字，用放大鏡一看，是「劉印銘傳」四個字，我這才明白這幾件物事的命義，是封爵掛印的寓意，按劉銘傳是安徽人，淸季做過福建台灣巡撫，並且因為軍功，封過男爵，大概是僚屬們巴結他的。這幾件小物事，和一根練條，都是用本身的象牙刻的，扯出來很容易，放進去，却費了不少的功夫。這種鬼斧神工，不知是何人的手法？可惜這件東西在我手不到幾年，有一次遭遇非常之變，性命幾乎不保，這件東西，也就沒有下落了</p>
<h3 id="c196">小本經營的一種大生意（續） <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>若使撈紙的人工，改做豆餅一般的粗坯，然可以事半功倍。所以我想這一種的分工合作，一定能够增加生產，別的紙張，還怕擱煞，變不了錢，若說坑紙，那是四萬萬人，無人不用的東西，各銷各的市塲，决不怕他永遠擱煞了的，又何憚而不為。</p>
<p>（二）凡在任何一個里巷之中。住戶定有不少，以上海論，一弄之中，有上一二百家，不足為奇。如向利用廠登記，担任分銷，但繳五十元的押權，即可取七十推去銷，計有一千五百四十刀之多，每刀售四分半，可售六十九元三角，繳價只需每捆七角，每銷百元，尙有五元酬佣，即在實際上祇核成本四十六元五角五分，可得二十二元七角九分之利益，如能一月兩轉，亦可觀矣。在初次的時候，我們還可以犧牲下下，每一家送他一卷在包紙上印明了某處是家有售，他午一經試用，必下感覺到物美價廉，不亞於舶來品，那就可以永久銷行，不怕別人來攘奪去了，這是很便當的事，又何樂而不為。</p>
<p>上述的方式，在製造方面，是個分工台作，在推銷方面，是個消費合作，而其每原是個產銷合作，我想一定可以行得出的吧？</p>

<h3 id="c197">嗣子問題 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 俞于魚</p>
<p>最近上海發生兩件母親毆斃兒女的新聞：一是蔣王氏毆斃親生女兒，一是王曹氏毆斃嗣子。</p>
<p>母子之愛，稟乎天性，世多不孝的兒女，而無不愛子女的父母。每一個兒女自生產至長大而到成家立業，為父母者沒有不是心力交瘁去扶養他，所謂父母愛子之心，無微不至。蔣王氏却以女兒善哭，及隨便拉尿拉矢，竟悖乎常情的嚴行責打，至於斃命，這種殘忍的手段，使我懷疑該氏或許患着重性的神經病吧？因為我們不能再為她强辯一個適當的理由了。</p>
<p>王曹氏毆斃的是嗣子，嗣子並非親骨肉，被其毆斃，情形便非如上述的那般簡單，而除了王曹氏這件案子被報章揭曉之外，在我們的周遭，恐怕不知還有若干類似的兇案在暗中發生。因之，我們丟開法律問題，放開眼睛來看看這個封建社會下的家庭制度。</p>
<p>一個新媳婦要進門來，三年沒有生育，做丈夫的就吵着計小，做翁姑的拿養鷄也會生蛋的比喻來諷刺，管閒事專家也將此作為消遺光陰的談話資料；這里一方面是這社會中重男輕女的習慣使然，另一方面是由遺產間題在暗中促成，因為我們的家庭制度是由兒子與遺產所組織成的。有了遺產沒有兒子，那是做父母的最大心事，在可能範圍之內，最便當的路子是納妾，因為不孝有三，無後為大的理由是振振有詞的。但是死了丈夫的寡婦呢？馬上有叔伯的姪子抱過來作為兒子。在表面上，第兄的骨肉，無分彼此，然而每個家庭的糾紛就從這里發生，而且虐待嗣子，至於歐斃的慘案亦接踵而至。</p>
<p>兒子是自家的好，現在一惆隔層肚子的孩子到嗣立的名義下去做兒子，要維持像普通一般母子的狀態已屬難事，况且還有那末多的曲折（由嗣立問題所引起的遺產糾紛）促成這一對假母子不能相容。於是做嗣母的有嗣母的理由，做嗣子的有嗣子的委曲，雙方暗中在背道而馳，而表面上又不得不維持母子的態度。王曹氏毆斃嗣子，新聞語焉不詳，我們無從懸猜個中曲折，不過嗣母與嗣子之間容易如水火之不相容是可以想到的，那末，竟出之於毆斃，或其他致死的手段，我們能說他是偶然的理由嗎？王曹氏的案件不過是被我們揭露之一，許多還在黑暗中爭鬬着的嗣母子之間，我們用什麽方法來解救他們呢？</p>
<h3 id="c198">啓行，多困難呵！ <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>——還鄉苦雪之一</p>
<p>日子，在艱苦的時候是不容易打發的，可是，牠却不會停留，讓日曆一張張地撕去，對自己的過程彷彿一點都不去顧惜，計算一下，那該是整整地九個年頭的事了。</p>
<p>為了父親的病亡，為了挨不了飢餓的逼迫，含着滿眶的淚水，跨上了渺茫的前途。心裏想，這樣，對於生活的負担，總該减輕了些吧？可是，一想到「前程』，以及建築在裏面的礁石，自己就有點怕，不是麽？十六歲的小孩子提了兩隻小毛拳頭，將怎樣的在鐵牆的社會裏揮動呢？</p>
<p>磨硬了頭皮，終於在和鐵牆相撞了，血，汗，力，被疲憊，酸痛，包國着，一天，一月，一年，撕碎的日曆滿堆在我的脚下，不能自覺的，我是高大了起來。</p>
<p>秋天被一陣料悄的北風趕，雪有來，鵝毛一樣，蓋住屋頂街面，約計着了三四寸的光景，就在這時，我失了業。</p>
<p>——往那裏去呢？常常地，自己在受着心底責問。</p>
<p>那個時候，風聲是非常緊急的，軍隊裝滿了整個的列車開了出去，惶恐打進了每個人的心，附近的鄉村携了老幼逃到了省城，但省城裏的資產者却向外省逃出去。火車麼？不要想，老早的停止開行，車站的空氣是靜寂的，不用說沒有錢，卽使有錢怕也不容易走出了那個圈子。也許是『吉星高照」吧？我想</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>不到在那緊要的關頭會有一列鹽車預備從這裏開往天津去。經了幾次的磋商，總算僥俸獲得了允許，這，在我簡直是無上的榮幸呵！</p>
<p>第二天的夜裏，一切的東西都收拾齊楚了。窗外，風刮得很厲害，忽的，門開了——</p>
<p>——眞討厭，火車不能停到本城，你——他遲頓了一下，我看還是乘明天早班車到鄭州等候着吧，車站上，是有人招呼的。那個押車的人跑來對我說。</p>
<p>已經安定的心情，又混亂起來，我總覺得那是太冒險了，一個沒有出過遠門的孩子，假使在鄭州車站沒有人招呼，假使車子再不能開行，那，眼前是昏黑的一片，將怎樣的去應付呢？想着，思緒格外的紛亂起來，最後，憑了垂危的餘勇和那卽在綫上的命運來搏鬥吧！</p>
<p>車站上的人頭亂鑽着，從月台走到了很遠的又道，那輛貨車被我發現了，遵守押車人的吿訴，把行李送上了貨車，並且，和預先拜托的人會見了，呵，這總該沒有問題了吧？我這樣自忖着。</p>
<p>——你不必多講話，記住。委受拜托的孫先生警吿我。</p>
<p>算一下，坐在車裏的一共不過二十多個人，行李倒還不少。刺骨的冷風由沒有門的洞口吹進來，牙齒磨擦着，周身聳起了小疙瘩。</p>
<p>車頭裏，拉長了喉嚨怪叫了，一遍，二遍，知道是快開行的時刻。</p>
<p>——喂，你是那裏的？幾個兵圍着我問了。我沒有響，隨後，他們逼問得更急了，眞糟糕，第一個就問到我，連考慮的機會都不能。看上去不開口是不行了——</p>
<p>——我麽？是×××的。我終於答復出來。</p>
<p>——好，下去，下去！不容分說，我就被推了下來，站在鐵軌的旁邊，孫君吿訴我叫我買一張票坐三等，行李他負責，等到鄭州後再見，說話的時候，似乎責難我不該多事。</p>
<p>三等車裏的人是滿滿的，我站在厠所的門邊，心頭不定的起伏着，想着行李，想着家鄉，想着繁盛的商埠，也想看商埠裏的埋伏，……我茫然了。</p>
<p>車子究竟在什麼時候開的？一點都沒有感覺到。</p>
<h3 id="c199">雪夜 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 沈塢</p>
<p>傍晚我們在屋子里烤着火，燒着一枝從郊野外邊檢拾回來的乾枯的椏枝，火焰輕輕地在漆黑的房子里搖曳着，照得每個人的臉都發出一陣紅艷的光采。</p>
<p>屋子里沒有窗，周圍堆積着一些載過洋貨的木箱，和一些土物的笨重的貨物，密密地，好象要把這屋子堆積成戰壕上的防禦工具那麼樣。空氣找不到一些空隙的餘地溜進來，大門是緊閉着。火燒着枯枝在辟拍地作響，有時飛出一些流星似底火燄，大家靜默地對着火堆，沒說話，靜謐的沉默是可怕的。然而欲沒人把這沉默打破，光是獃獃地圍坐着。</p>
<p>雪下着，象棉花似底，在門縫里還依稀地看得見在雪中的行人。慢慢地，有一個黑影把門縫的小隙里遮住了，隱隱聽得到是一陣沉重的脚步聲，大家的視綫立刻從火堆中轉移到大門外邊去。聽着脚步聲棄棄地一步一步的移近了來。</p>
<p>一種非常單調的敲門聲，使我們意識着在這雪夜中的可怕的遠行。</p>
<p>門開了，意外地並不是老閣，而是隆昌山貨莊的伙伴，那個小胖子覃福；他暗暗地吐了口氣，心里想：「要是今晚遠得趕路，那才糟呢！今天的雪下得特別多，晚上的山路就難行了」。然而在大家的腦海里，誰也不敢决定今晚要不要捱夜路的。</p>
<p>竹老頭讓開一個位置給覃福坐下，他身上滿是雪花，雪一碰到火燄，立刻就一滴一滴的化成水了。於是他把身子搖了幾搖，讓水滴流了下來，才慢慢地坐下了。</p>
<p>屋子里多了一個人，好象就沒有剛才那樣死寂。大家的視綫都集中在罩福的身上，好象要從他身上找出一些什麽來做談話的資料似的。竹老頭閉住了眼睛，在想着一些什麼事。一瞬之后，他突然就發出一聲沉長的太息，向覃福望了望，才咧開那張乾枯的嘴說：</p>
<p>「覃福，你們莊里雪天不用趕夜路了吧？聽老明說：山貨一到冬天就用不着在晚上去趕運啦。……你們的老闆也眞好，雪天並不難為了伙伴；我們可不成啦，日也趕，夜也趕，今晚還不曉得怎麽樣？我也太不中用了，做了幾十年的長伕，依舊是沒出息。雪天走路眞危險，萬一一時血氣衰，不濟事，那可就完蛋啦！活不得好活，死總得個好死才成呢，死在山里做山土地，我眞有點不願意。……唉，眞難說，這些我是親眼見過的，林二伯伯就是這樣死的……說起來眞可怕……」他歇了歇，於是又靜默着。</p>
<p>覃福把頭低沉下去，看着火燄在飄忽着，用手把椏枝挑弄了一下子，似是想抬起頭來回答竹老頭的話，可是他只恍惚地看了他一眼，依舊又沒做聲的低沉下去了。</p>
<p>大家仍是靜謐地坐着，松森伸出兩隻手來打了一個呵欠，伸了伸懶腰，顯出有點疲倦的樣子。竹老頭把眼睛閉了又開着，不時望着我們的神氣，又低頭在沉思。</p>
<p>夜漸漸溜了過去，雪似乎越落越大了。門外的脚步就稀疏起來。</p>
<p>乾枝的火燄也沒有剛才那末旺盛了，脚尖很有點冷硬而旦痛癢的樣子。松森耐不住默然的苦寂，要睡了。覃福於是就打算回去。</p>
<p>我替覃福開了門，他把手電筒朝街上恍了恍，雪已厚厚的蓋着地面。他走了幾步，突然「呀」的大叫一聲，回頭叫着我的名字：「老岑」！</p>
<p>我以為他發生了什麼事一把拉着竹老頭的手，從身邊模了一桿手鎗，就跑了出來。</p>
<p>覃福把手電筒照在雪地上，是一具殭屍，雪已經把他緊緊地壓住，人也沒有呼吸了。竹老頭抖抖着斑白的頭，唏噓地說：「唉，到底是苦命的！——」</p>

<p>藝華影業公司傾力攝製之最新名貴出品，解剖工商業衰落原因之問題劇，全部對白有聲歌唱鉅片「時勢英雄」，日內公映於金城大戲院。關於此部影片，旣有導演人應雲衛抱絕大自信在先，復有擁護觀衆寄熱誠注意於後，其能響動全滬自無疑義。並且片中不僅對於五十年來中國工商業的盛衰興敗，有着深刻尖銳的解剖，尤是對於五十年來外人的多量來華，並其積極對華各種事業投資狀態，乃至中國社會因此所受之影響並所激起之波瀾，以及經濟文化所受之侵略，及變遷等，均有明白的介紹有系統的叙述。因導演人頗能善用電影手法，故自始至終，是充滿着緊張，熱烈，刺激的氛圍氣　，能緊緊地抓住每一個觀衆的心理，使觀衆興奮的情緒隨着劇情的展開呈示高漲，甚至爆發在不能自抑的感情之中。特別是四五十年前的上海市街狀况及上海各階層士女的服裝風俗習慣等，又都一一表現於此片中，故它還能給觀衆一種回憶的感觸，如啖諫果津津然有餘味，在緊張情緒中猶露出一層會心的微笑。</p>

<p>無論就那一方面看來，『天倫』的成功，實在是爲中國電影界爭得了極大的光榮。</p>
<p>就劇情論，這裏展開了一個家庭四代的故事，以極複雑的人的關係，闡釋了家族主義的眞意義。我國人向來中富於家族思想的，由於這種思想的根深蒂固，便漸漸陷於偏狹，只知道有家族，而忘記了在家族之外，過有一個更大的社會存在着，社會乃至國家，都被這狹義的家族思想所支配，因而感受極大的影響，『天倫」抓住這一主題，嚴肅地說明：每一個人，都要把對於家庭的愛，擴張到全人類去。在人生」裏，劇作者鍾石根曾高呼着救孩子的口號，在「天倫」裏，他又提出了這正義的呼聲。</p>
<p>論導演，最可注意的是每一個鏡頭，都有着新頴的創造。在任何一小段裏，都可以看出導演者是費了極辛苦的心思的，人物的安排，空氣的創造，鏡頭的運用，都是別出心裁的——將使你驚異，驚異在中國落後的機械技巧下，能產生這樣驚人的作品來。</p>
<p>談到演員：這是足以傲視一切的。集合了聯華的明星的精萃，造成了「大路」後的唯一奇跡，每一個人，都得到了平均的發展，都貫獻他們最精熟的演技，看這樣一部影片，只就其演員而論，巳足够使人滿足了。</p>
<p>當然，攝影，佈景……乃至一切的一切，都是有可驚的成就的。</p>
<p>這是中國電影界的光榮。</p>

<p>羅馬之浴園建築，共分二種：一，小浴園，二，大浴園，前者建自民國時代，稱之為Balnae，仿希臘制，其容積可數百人；在羅馬城此種小浴園，不下六百餘所，然大多係私人的，故又可稱做「私人的浴園」。後者建自帝國時代，稱之為Thernae，其容積可數千人，全城約有一百餘所，因其係公共性質的並且又為國家出資創辦的，故又可稱做「公共的浴園」。在世界建築藝術史上前者影響少，後者影響大。故一般研究建築的人，所言之羅馬浴園，大多係指公共的大浴園而言。在此，我們可知當時此種建築的出現，眞好像在希臘時代出現神廟建築一般地令人得到一個很好的印象！深印在我人的腦海中，給我們認識古代的建築藝術，是怎樣地織巧，珍奇，偉大，……。</p>
<p>羅馬之有浴園係戰於非北布尼（Punic）之元帥西此阿（ScipiaApricanus）所創建，然工不完美，一至羅馬成國，浴園亦僅備用，及至帝制時代，一變從前舊觀，踵事增華，恣意尋樂，於是浴園之功用，亦自衛生之旨一變而為奢恣尋樂之所了；此羅馬浴園建築之歷史大概也。</p>
<p>羅馬之公共浴園，又好像現代的俱樂部一般，因其用途不僅供人民沐浴之用，並且又係供人民以作消遣之用，故其中除浴池建築一部份外，又有公園，運動塲，戲園，休息室，藏書室以及諸市塲，皆附建在內的。至於浴池之形式，則殊不一列，有正方形的，有長方形的，有渾圓的，有橢圓的，環浴池沿岸之建築，則有巨室，卽沐浴以後，供穿衣之穿衣廳也。穿衣廳外，有彩柱之廻廊，周行通園，浴池的水，除冷熱外，又有香水等以供婦女之用，並且在宮殿中的浴池，又有用牛乳的，在「羅宮春色」影片中所謂「帝后同浴牛乳百斛」是也。由此可知當時羅馬之驕奢淫樂，在此又可作一有力的鐵證了。</p>
<p>羅馬浴園建築之材料，大多係用貴重性質的；園內嵌工，則各色珠璧，映光射目；其浴池或金，銀，玉，及晶瑩白石，其附屬之雕刻圖畫，花卉人物，維妙維肖；其廻廊之柱廓，皆施以華麗的色彩，足使此堂皇的浴園，更添一層魔力！使游者目眩神怡，有入於幻境的奇想呢！</p>
<p>羅馬人民之嗜好沐浴，眞好像現在中國一般下級社會人們的嗜好吃茶一般。羅馬人之進浴園，等於中國人之上茶館。又浴池之水有冷有熱，故有人旣嘗惟熱塘，文經涼池，　地為良，樂此不疲，竟有自幼入園，由批至老，樂而忘一返者。加以國內外各種新聞，都聚於圍中之穿衣廳，日結朋儕，時聆新說，直等博覽會塲一般。因其是故，故浴園之魔力，更一天天地偉大了。至於浴園之最大代表作，則為皇帝加若加拏（Caracalla）經毀損，但後人觀其遺跡若十餘里之城址一般，其工程之偉大，亦可想而知了！論者謂羅馬之浴園，足表羅馬之極盛，亦足招羅馬之敗亡；雖致敗之由多　，而浴園亦其一也。自日耳曼森林蠻族出，而羅馬亦宣吿滅亡；一至羅馬滅亡後，浴園中之大客堂就改為基督敎之禮拜堂了。園內之金石珍品，亦　於歐洲各國之博物館中了。浴園之大石改為某督敎徒之葬棺。因浴園建築在威力全盛時代，固為國家建築榮耀之代表物；而在宗社覆滅時，亦足以昭罪惡之炯戒。由此我們可知建築物非但能代表國家之興衰，並且又可左右於國家之興衰呢！</p>
<p>中國之浴園，始於何時？實無從考證。不過我們知道，在唐代已經有了。並且偉大的代表作亦先後出現了不少。其中最著名的則有建於陜西臨淹縣南驪山上之「華清池」。池內係溫泉，唐太宗初建時種做易泉宮，玄宗改為華清宮，池亦因名華淸池。並在池邊環列殿臺，幷置百司及公卿邸第，其建築之宏麗，亦可想而知了！而况其中又有一段香艷的故事呢！</p>
<p>中國之浴園正同羅馬之浴園一般，大多係建於宮殿之內，專供帝后享樂之用。從「唐會要」中，我們可見下列的一段記載說：</p>
<p>「……德宗謂裴延齡曰所居浴堂殿一棟將壓念易之未能也……」</p>
<p>又從「白居易詩」中，可以找到二句：</p>
<p>「慣看溫室樹飽識浴堂花」</p>
<p>由以上二段看來，則我們可知當時的浴園是怎樣的盛行於宮殿之內了。惜無專書記載其建築詳情，我們也無從探討了。</p>
<p>至於我國浴園之民間建築又怎樣呢？則我們可從「揚州畫舫錄」一書中記載的知道一些大概：來作本文的結束罷！</p>
<p>「浴池之風開於邵伯鎭之郭堂，後徐寗門外之張堂效之，並以白石為池，方丈餘，間為大小數格，其大者近鑊，水熱為大池，小而水不甚熱者為娃娃池。」（完）</p>

<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>—關於築塲裏用—</p>
<p>蘆菲——什麽呌做蘆菲。就是普通一般人稱作蘆蓆的那裏用毛柴管做成的東西。在築塲裏對於蘆菲的用途。從前差不多依賴的地方居多。現在因為工務管理當局（指租界而言）鑒於蘆菲易於引火起見。在不能避免而必須應用之外。大概都在被禁之例。可是內地建築房屋。那些資本短拙的作頭。為了節省開銷的緣故。往往仍舊用蘆菲搭帳房間及料房（詳前）等的星面和墻身的。</p>
<p>油搭——油搭的意思。便是一種用桑皮紙浸在桐油裏。待晒乾後取用的油紙的另一名稱。它是用以夾在蘆菲的內層。（兩張蘆菲甲間夾一張油搭）以便蓋屋面防止雨水被浸的設備。</p>
<p>扞子——用竹爿削成的一種兩頭尖。形狀像箭頭的東西。就呌做扞子。用以平蘆菲的。（什麼叫做不蘆菲。就是蓋屋面或墻身。用扞子使扞成平坦）。</p>
<p>竹篾——用竹頭搭脚手。同樣有衝天。氣扛。頂撐。橫楞等許多名稱。可是它的做法並不像木脚手似用幾道鉛絲繞緊的。它是以竹篾使各處紮牢。竹篾是以竹靑（就是靑的一面。另一面叫竹黃。）削成的七八尺長的細條。用時須浸入水裏。因為竹篾的性質太乾燥就不容易紮牢脚手的接頭。補救的方法。祇要在水裏浸過以後。紮起來就比較便當些了。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 大康</p>
<p>中國電影之光榮作品</p>
<p>二十年來，中國只有這樣一部「天倫」，是絕無僅有的大胆的作品；它足以担當起「電影藝術」道隆重的尊稱。</p>
<p>國內影壇，從來沒有人敢於嘗試這樣一部範疇極廣的劇本，它包括了七八十年間的故事，從第一代寫至第四代，從家庭之愛寫到人類之愛，它的名字雖然呌「天倫」，但實際它却不僅限於狹義的家族主義，它是主張打破家族主義而把這愛推及於全人類的。</p>
<p>連串起四代同堂的故事，寫出了一個家庭的變遷，發揮所謂「人類愛」——宇宙間最偉大純眞的愛，這是「天倫」的整體。</p>
<p>「天倫」是名編劇家鍾石根編的，他以前的作品，如「人道」「城市之夜」「人生」，沒有一個不是精湛的作品。在本劇裏，他仍然運用複雜的結構，寄託他的高超的理想，從這裏，人們可窺見他為人類為人羣而吶喊的精神。</p>
<p>導演這一類繁複的戲，是異常困難的，本片導演者却能勝任愉快，運用其特殊的手法，極沉重的調子，把這一個頭緒紛紜的戲，整理得有條不紊，在每一個鏡頭，每一段獻裏，你都可以找到新的，特殊的創造，有時，雖然是極平常的戲，但在他的手法下，會感到人的心靈的深處。</p>
<p>演員，這裏遴選了聯華最優秀的角色，每三個人都有着最盡致的發揮，聯華用了所有演員的百分之九十，全力攝成此片。</p>
<p>中國電影界之光榮的紀錄，「天倫」是足以當之無愧的。</p>
<h3 id="c213">美藝之天倫 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 游子</p>
<p>以中國第一流之導演，費時一年餘，耗資近十萬，集聯華十二大明星之精力，寫反正前後四十年代中國社會演進之歷程，卽此已足獨步影壇雄視一切。</p>
<p>尤有進者…</p>
<p>『天倫』意識之正確非惟影壇上前無古人，卽在社會意義上，由親子之愛而出發，以人類之愛為歸著，此種倫理觀誠千古不磨之眞理，其偉大逈非一般卒爾操觚之流所可企及</p>
<p>以佈景言，建築則美輪美奐，陳設則富麗堂皇，其點綴畫面之美麗自無論矣，於宣揚中國固有之藝術，厥功力不可泯。</p>
<p>外景之採取，獨具匠心，江南煙雨，本已醉人，水色山光，彌望千里，睇觀之餘，樣懷為之一廓。</p>
<p>演員演技之一貫，尤為此片之特點，純以深沉取勝，至性感人，予觀者以欲避不得之印像，覩而不下淚者蓋無其人。</p>
<p>總之，天倫一片非僅中國電影史上空前之奇蹟，卽世界影壇亦將為此而震動。</p>
<h3 id="c214">天倫演員點將錄 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>

<p>林楚楚</p>
<p>銀幕上的慈母，萬千孤兒的慰藉者，在天倫中有着空前的表現，她以往的成績，無不勝任愉快，而在天倫中可謂百尺竿頭，更進一步，尤其在宣布他們的孫子挪用公欵的時候，他的表情，可謂動天地，泣鬼神。</p>
<p>陳燕燕</p>
<p>電影觀衆一致愛戴的無邪的小鳥，悲角的天才，在這裏是一個任性的孩子，也是唯一的得到悲慘的結果的人物。越是在悲慘的氛圍中才越能窺見燕燕的天才，這一個無須介紹的人物，在這裏—尤其是失意以後一舉一動都會打動你的心坎。</p>
<p>尚冠武</p>
<p>他那卓越的天才，一絲不苟的精神，縝密　　敏的思想，無一不適合天倫中偉大、王人翁的性格與身份。</p>
<p>黎灼灼</p>
<p>熱女郎在這裏作了潑婦，一偭典型的潑婦，不孝翁姑，調唆丈夫，慕虛榮，好面子，潑婦所有的條件，她這裏一應俱全。</p>
<p>張冀</p>
<p>蛇蝎美人中張翼的性格在這裏再現一次；可以為善，也可以為惡，天與人之戰，父與妻之爭，他不能解决，他幾乎作了永遠迷途的羔羊。</p>

<p>貂斑華</p>
<p>嶄然露頭角的新星，面上浮着勝利的微笑越顯得燕燕失意的悲哀</p>

<p>學理與經騐俱富的人兒，是無往而不「取之左右逢其源」的，在這裏，他擔任後半部的重要工作。</p>
<p>梅琳</p>
<p>美麗淸秀的小姑娘，作了人家低頭忍氣的小媳婦，一股子貞靜幽嫻的味兒。</p>
<p>一部片裏能有這多燦爛的明星，而他們又都是久經百戰的無敵勁旅。只此，可以知道它的偉大與其優美。</p>
<p>論導演的藝術，那「天倫」稱之為中國電影有史以來唯一的創作巨製確當之無愧，而且，我們相信，這片子絕對的能給我影壇爭得無上光榮呵。</p>
<h3 id="c215">推荐 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 報</p>
<p>我們願把這聯華視為珍寳的短片『天倫』向全上海仕女做有力的推荐！</p>
<p>這是我們所深切知道的：聯華完成此片曾經籌備三年，攝製一載，化去重大的資金和腦血，差不多全聯華的精力全集中於此片。</p>
<p>當這片的劇本送中央登記時，曾得中央的極大褒獎，幷要它們「妥善攝製』；在完成之時，全國電影刋物又多優好之預評，我們對於這片的價値，由此可以推想。</p>
<p>在全國極度渴望之注視下，已定在明天獻映，而且開演的這家影院，是我們上海最豪麗最高尙的大光明戲院。</p>
<p>天倫之第一次映權已為大光明所得，大光明自開幕迄今是從未演過中國片，原因它的觀衆大都屬於西人、如今該院把這片介紹給廣大的西洋觀衆，使他們有機會來欣賞中國電影藝術的健美，這是有音義的</p>
<p>『天倫』之能於大光明放映，同時幷將推行到世界去，這是中國電影有史以來一件最足欣慰的事，也可說是說片得到奮鬥後的勝利！</p>
<h3 id="c216">大光明下期開映之「天倫」之我言 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 屠龍</p>
<p>「天之經也，地之義也，民之行也。」</p>
<p>這確是中國影壇一部希有的作品！</p>
<p>從劇情與劇旨方面看：寫數十年代中一個家庭中曾，祖，父，子四代的事跡，不過道數十年代，正是東西文化急劇接觸而社會態度與社會標準幾經變更的時候，反映於這數十年代中國社會的心理上與行為上的也具有各種不同的形態，而尤其，東西文化甫經接觸不久，舊的社會態度與社會標準都行將摧毀，新的社會態度，社會標準匪特尙未建設起來而尙在各是其所是而非其所非的莫衷一是之中。在這時候的人們都想逃出舊日的樊籠，但是逃出舊樊籠以後「到何處去」？「到何處去」的問題無法解决，自然地落得彷徨，彷徨或是誤入歧途。冷靜地說，怕是當年誤入歧途的還多於彷徨的人吧！</p>
<p>這「天倫」裏指示給誤入歧途的人們的是：回來罷，迷途的羔羊！不過這裏所指示給迷途的羔羊的不是來時的舊路，而是在舊路前面一條正途，那便是說：把你自己貢獻給廣大的羣衆。</p>
<p>從這劇名上看，可以了然這劇旨一定是敎「孝」的，不錯，一點都不錯，敎孝，不過這裏不是敎人學「割臂療親」「朝山拜佛為親祈壽」的愚孝，換言之不是敎人作「非人的孝。而是敎人以自然的，人性的孝，</p>
<p>「人類愛的發端，基於一種赤子之愛，卽父母子女間的天性之愛。字宙亘古不變，此愛亦亘古不滅。」</p>
<p>這裏不把「孝」解釋成子女的對於父母的一種絕對的義務，尤其，不把牠解釋成一種親子關係（注意是關係）中私有的東西，他把牠解釋成一種人類相五間的一種共同的情操，是因了或種便利而發生較早的廣博的人類愛的一部分。</p>
<p>因了解釋的不同，對於行孝的方式便有了顯著差異了。</p>
<p>把孝解釋成親子關係的私有物，是子女對於父母的絕對的義務的括，那麼第一，父母可以不慈，而子女則不能不孝，第二，祇要行了所謂「孝」則所操的手段如何可以不問，醫為强盜雖然殺入越貨，而他可以因供甘旨以悅親而博得孝子之名。</p>
<p>這裏不然！</p>
<p>說「孝」（其實是愛）是人類相互間的一種共同的情操，是推及廣博人類的愛的始基，因此，在家庭中就產生了父慈子孝的原則，對外則「老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼」。愛人卽是孝親，損人以孝親，不但不得謂之孝。而且還要謂之逆。</p>
<p>這種倫理觀可謂「置之百世而不變，放諸四海而皆準」了。</p>
<p>從技巧方面看；以一個質直的故事，配置數十年代的時間與數十演員。在系統條理上已是比較難於支配的工作，而導演者很巧妙地處理了這時間與人物。在理論上他採取了新象徵主義的見地，他把一些看來似乎與本題沒有多少關係而其實是最强有力的材料熱心的運用了來，非特為故事的寫出上——無論是明示或暗示地增加上若干的助力，怕是在中國電影領域裏也算是一種嶄新的新型哩。</p>
<p>在前面說過，「天倫」所昭示於人的是「人性的愛」，導演者便抓住了此點。本來這所謂人性是人類特有的一種品德，讀者不要誤會筆者是具有幾分唯心論的色彩，不是的，所謂人性的愛也並不是憑空掉入人類意識境界來的東西，而是若干年人類文化積累的結果，是原始的愛的昇華。</p>
<p>導演者巴這中心意識著意地加以描寫，有幾個場面的偉大的沉痛的景像巴觀者吸引得幾疑置身其中而深深為之所感動，雖然其中不免多少地含有些說敎的成分，然而，可喜的是如同　了白居易的詩一樣，縱然是說敎並不覺的一些兒枯燥呆板。</p>
<p>尤其，畫面的偉大與美麗給觀者以絕大的吸引，而其偉大與美麗，筆者寧舍去富麗堂皇美輪美奐的建築而取其富有詩意的自然景色。雖然是一水一雲一鳥一木，不消去玩味他所含蘊的某種深意，就祇在審美的觀點予以估價，其美妙也就迥非俗手之可以運用得到的了。至若，在遼闊的山林，潔白的羔羊自由地跳躍齕齧着，夕陽從地平下反照上他的餘光，牧人登高一呼，會使你不由地聯想起「日之夕矣」之句吧！</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Problem of Rescuing the Fishing Industry <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Wei</p>
<p>Our country's coastal fishing areas, according to recent scientific exploration, are approximately 271,805 square nautical miles, making them excellent fishing grounds. If they can be developed smoothly, the future of fisheries production is truly unlimited. However, in recent years, due to the dumping of foreign fish and the encroachment of foreign vessels, our country's fishing industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. Since this summer, the situation in the fishing areas of various provinces has been particularly bleak. In the Dinghai Shenjiamen area, there were originally more than a thousand fishing boats, but in the recent winter fishing season, less than one-third went out to fish. Hupu, Shengshan, Zhapu and other places were originally well-known fishing villages, but now not a single fishing boat from other villages goes there. Even the number of fishing boats from this village is very few. Compared with the past when fish vendors filled the roads and masts stood like forests, they are truly not the same. This is from the perspective of fishermen. As for ice-fresh fish boats, which hold the key to the transportation and sale of fish products, they have mostly suffered losses this spring due to a sharp decline in the purchasing power of consumer areas and a tragic drop in fish prices. Those without funds have stopped operating, and those with funds have also reduced the scope of their operations. The number of boats has therefore fallen to more than half. The operations of Shanghai fish firms have fallen sharply. Many have already gone bankrupt. During the fish firm settlement period at the beginning of autumn, hundreds of employees were laid off in large numbers. The number of those affected must be more than a thousand. This is from the perspective of fish merchants. Our country's fishing industry is in such a precarious state, and the government authorities should sincerely provide proper relief from the economic aspects. However, there are two other points that should be noted.</p>
<p>First, along the coast of our country, there are often foreign fishing boats that encroach on our fishing grounds, relying on their advanced technology to search for fishing profits without leaving any stone unturned. It is difficult for our country's fishing boats with immature technology to compete. These foreign fishing vessels sometimes even penetrate deep into our various harbors. For national defense, there is also a profound impact. Therefore, for the sake of preserving fishing rights, it is hoped that the government authorities will use diplomatic means to crack down on them.</p>
<p>Second, coastal fishermen gather in villages on various islands. Even during the fishing season, they rarely go to cities and towns. Administrative officials mostly neglect the management of fishing villages and the education of fishermen to an excessive degree. As a result, the culture is backward, and the technology of fishermen can never progress. Therefore, coastal fishery administration is extremely important today. It is also hoped that the government authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The official statement of the Fifth Plenary Session includes the item "Encourage the Fishing Industry" in the section "Enrich the Economy to Benefit the People's Livelihood." After the closing of the First Plenary Session, our government should be able to adhere to the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session and implement effective relief methods in the fishing industry. I dare to briefly express my humble opinions as above, based on my daily feelings, for your selection.</p>

<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 9th, students from major universities and middle schools in Beiping went to Jurentang to petition He Yingqin, the commander-in-chief, to oppose autonomous puppet organizations and demand unity to save the nation. After the Beiping authorities were informed, they immediately ordered the police and military police to be dispatched for guard. Students in the city arrived at the front gate of Zhongnanhai in succession from 9:00 AM. At around 10:00 AM, hundreds of male and female students lined up and waited in front of the gate, and the order was still good. However, He Yingqin went to Tangshan, and Hou Cheng came out to meet them, and announced to the public that Minister He was not in the city and that representatives could state their petition opinions and they would be forwarded. The students then followed the order. By 12:30 PM, the number of students was about to reach a thousand. Immediately afterwards, they marched in procession, shouting slogans of petition along the way and giving speeches to the people. They proceeded westward from Xinhua Gate to Xidan Archway, where they were persuaded to disperse by the local police and military police. A small group continued to march to the students from Qinghua and Yenching Universities outside the city. There were five or six hundred people who formed a team and entered the city at 8:00 AM, marched to Xizhimen, and were blocked by the police and military police and were unable to enter. At 5:00 PM, the authorities of various schools sent people to persuade them to return to school. The students in the city also returned in succession by 6:00 PM in the afternoon. (9th [of December] Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The municipal government announced the news that the students of various universities had a united gathering action this morning, and it has been peacefully stopped by the military police in coordination. Lei Sishang, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that yesterday he heard that the students of various universities and colleges would have a joint gathering action, and the military and political officials in charge have asked the presidents of various universities and colleges to be responsible for guiding and stopping the action. I summoned the principals of municipal secondary schools and representatives of private schools yesterday and had a sincere conversation, urging them to maintain order in their usual spirit and not to be incited. If there is any irregular action, the government will never tolerate it. There were many funerals in Beiping today, and it was planned to transport the coffins out of the city and bury them in the suburbs. However, due to temporary reasons, they could not leave the city, so they were parked on the road. On the roads near the Pingze Desheng Xizhi three gates, there were three to five coffins parked in a row, which was quite noticeable. (9th [of December] special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the recent unrest in the situation in Beiping, in order to promote good neighborliness, protect overseas Chinese, and stabilize people's hearts, the Beiping Municipal Authorities have ordered the military and police to strictly guard against and prohibit gatherings, parades, and other actions. Those who violate this will be severely punished. All immigrant students are advised to concentrate on their studies, so that local security can be guaranteed. (9th [of December] Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) One hundred and eighty-four teachers and staff members of various universities in Nanjing, including Yu Deng, published a "Declaration on the North China Issue" on the 9th. The original text states that the entire territory and sovereignty of the Republic of China must not be divided or destroyed. If any part, under the pretext of public opinion, creates so-called autonomous movements or other organizations that hinder unification, it will be enough to endanger the lifeline of the country. Our government's difficult situation is understood by the people of the country. However, at this critical juncture of survival, it should widely consult public opinion and uphold the original intention of loyalty and exhaustive planning for the country. Any unreasonable demands that may endanger our last lifeline should be strictly rejected, and there should be no concessions or understandings that would be self-defeating. We hereby declare that we will adhere to this proposition and be the support of our government. (9th [of December] Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Student Union attempted to oppose the autonomy movement. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, about 1,000 male and female students from Qinghua University and Yenching University outside Beiping, and about 1,000 male and female students from Beiping University, Normal University, etc. inside the city, echoed each other inside and outside, held a petition movement against autonomy. One team inside the city went straight to Jurentang and was blocked by the Xinhua Gate Police Station. One team outside the city could not enter the city because the city gate had been closed and was currently arguing with the soldiers guarding the city. At the same time, leaflets were distributed, and the text was very激烈. (9th [of December] telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, students throughout the city held a demonstration against autonomy. Students from fifteen national and private universities participated. At first, it was thought that they were against the conditions for resolving the North China incident, but later it was learned that the purpose of their demonstration was to express Beiping's unwillingness to be autonomous. At that time, the military police were busy suppressing the demonstration. When the news was heard, the West City was tightly closed, so students from Tsinghua and Yenching universities were unable to enter the city. However, the students in the city still gathered outside He Yingqin's residence and demanded to see him. After learning that He [Yingqin] had gone to Tangshan, they refused to see He's secretary. After staying for a while, they marched in procession through the streets of the West City. Soon they met the police, who wielded sticks to disperse them. In the afternoon, there were few students left in the city, probably because the temperature had dropped to freezing. However, the students of Tsinghua and Yenching universities were still standing in the north wind below the fifty-foot-high city wall, determined to enter the city. After He Yingqin heard the news of the students' demonstration, he telephoned Tangshan to urge the school principals to stop it, so as not to cause diplomatic disputes. The guards of various government offices were increased today to prevent accidents from happening. (9th [of December] Reuters telegram)</p>

The Central Committee has listed him as a cultural worker, which is more in line with his personality and allows him to contribute to society, which is gratifying. Finally, he stated that Wang could not come in person to say goodbye due to his injuries, and he was entrusted to represent him, wishing everyone to pay their respects to him from afar and wishing him a speedy recovery.

<p>(London) The naval conference, one of the most important conferences since the war, opened at 10:30 this morning in the Locarno Room of the British Foreign Office. British Prime Minister Baldwin first gave a speech welcoming the delegates from various countries and explained Britain's position. He then left the meeting, meeting with Acting Foreign Secretary Eden, showing the severity of the situation in Italy and Abyssinia. U.S. delegate Davis followed the British Prime Minister and spoke, explaining the U.S.'s attitude. Japanese delegate Nagano followed and spoke. Other speakers included Australian delegate Bruce, Canadian delegate Meighen, French delegate Corbin, Indian delegate Butler, South African delegate Dulanty, Italian delegate Grandi, New Zealand delegate Ball, and South African delegate Walter. Each delegation sent twelve people to attend the opening meeting. The speaking time was limited to five minutes. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The naval conference opened today. The U.S. advocates a 20% reduction in naval power, Britain advocates limiting submarines, Japan demands equality, and France and Italy oppose entering into long-term agreements. The U.S. firmly disagrees with Japan's demand for equality, so the conference is bound to become a stalemate. After speeches by the delegates from various countries, today's meeting adjourned at 11:45 AM and will reconvene at 10:30 AM tomorrow. (9th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials here heard the speeches of the delegates from various countries at the London Naval Conference today and were pessimistic, believing that the positions of Britain, the U.S., and Japan are too far apart and that a new treaty has little hope of being established. (9th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to well-informed sources, Japan seems to agree with the proposal made by British Prime Minister Baldwin in his opening speech at the naval conference to conclude an agreement on the misuse of submarines. However, Japan will firmly oppose the proposal made by President Roosevelt in his letter to his chief delegate Davis to reduce the total tonnage of the navy by 20%, and will oppose the reduction in the quality and quantity of submarines. If Britain and the U.S. cannot agree on a substantial reduction in the quality and quantity of battleships and aircraft carriers, Japan may still demand an increase of 78,000 tons. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the naval disarmament conference held on the 9th, British Prime Minister Baldwin's speech was the opening speech, and the essence of its content has now been shown to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the British government. Although his tone was extremely steady, he hoped to continue the main purpose of the Washington Treaty and establish a general agreement on naval armaments in the spirit of mutual concession, advocating the complete abolition or extreme reduction of submarines. Especially when an agreement cannot be reached, he advocates the implementation of qualitative restrictions on various warships, which is particularly noteworthy. Judging from this situation, the attitude of the British government towards this conference has not made any progress since the preparatory negotiations, nor has it produced any new meaning, and it is still far from the position of the Japanese government. Therefore, the future of the conference will inevitably have many difficulties. (9th Japan League Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the question of abolishing or prohibiting the misuse of submarines, which is part of the British proposal, the Japanese Navy has expressed its views, which are recorded as follows: The majority of representatives at the Geneva General Disarmament Conference have considered submarines to be defensive weapons, and the relative relationship with similar forces in other countries is extremely weak. Therefore, countries consider them to be necessary defensive forces based on their defensive position and geographical location. Especially in Japan's position, they are even more necessary. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the abolition of submarines. As for the agreement to prohibit misuse, it is another matter. (9th Japan League Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Speeches by Delegates from Various Countries <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(London) The main points of the speeches of the delegates are as follows: British Prime Minister Baldwin said that Britain's position has been explained in detail at the 1932 Disarmament Conference and has not changed since then. The British government is still prepared to extend the principles of the Washington and London Naval Treaties and make necessary amendments to adapt to changes in the international situation and the needs of various countries. The current conference has two obligations: to continue the work of previous conferences and to strive to avoid the recurrence of unrestricted naval competition. The British government attaches great importance to the continuation of qualitative and quantitative restrictions and hopes to see a reduction in the types of large ships and large guns, and even more hopes to see the abolition of submarines. If the international community can reach a compromise on this, the world's naval construction expenditure will definitely be greatly reduced in the future.</p>
<p>The British Prime Minister continued, saying that preliminary talks were very valuable, and countries can now understand each other's special problems and difficulties. We should agree on some restrictions so that, on the one hand, countries can have room to cope with their special needs, and on the other hand, we can dispel the world's fear of naval competition. This is very important. The most expensive and most dangerous part of naval competition is the desire of countries to compete with each other on new types of warships. As for the submarine issue, if agreement cannot be reached on its abolition, there must be an agreement to prevent its misuse. The French and Italian governments can accept the provisions of the London Naval Treaty regarding the treatment of merchant ships by submarines in wartime. These provisions have long been accepted by the U.S. and Japan, so he hopes that unrestricted submarine warfare can be avoided in the future. Although some delegates may not agree with some provisions of the Washington and London Treaties, there is one undeniable fact: in the past fourteen years, there has been no naval construction competition that has harmed relations between countries as before. He firmly believes that if countries are prepared to make slight concessions in their demands for the sake of public welfare, an agreement that not only reduces tonnage but also enhances the world's sense of security can be easily concluded. (9th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Davis, Chairman of the U.S. delegation to the London Naval Conference, said in a speech to the delegates today that the U.S. does not intend to take the lead in naval competition, and said, "We do not want to increase the navy, but only want to limit and reduce it. Most of our current construction programs are to replace old ships, which is also consistent with this desire. The U.S. has stopped building warships for ten years. Even in terms of the existing construction plan, the strength allowed by the London Treaty to be achieved by the end of 1936 will not be achieved until 1942. We do not hope to exceed the restrictions of this treaty."</p>
<p>Before Davis's speech, he first read a letter from Roosevelt fourteen months ago. The President strongly stated in the letter that the U.S. does not want any naval competition, but hopes that the existing naval treaties can continue to be effective, and said, "The Washington Conference is a monument to the progress of human civilization. The London Treaty also recognizes that this good work should be promoted, and the reduction of the navy should be further expanded. The Washington and London Treaties are now not only a mathematical formula, and the ratio stipulated is based on the comparative needs of national defense of various countries. The main interests of various countries are not sacrificed, and the security between naval powers is not damaged. If these treaties are abolished one day, the principle of mutual security will be completely out of balance and will lead to competition in naval construction. The outcome is difficult to predict." Davis added that in order to achieve the goal of limiting international naval competition, amending existing treaties is also a method, otherwise, we should try our best to exchange opinions in a frank and friendly manner, so that we can find a way to mutual understanding, as a basis for the establishment of a more permanent and more extensive treaty in the future. (9th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The full text of the speech by Japanese Plenipotentiary Nagano at the opening ceremony of the Naval Disarmament Conference held today is as follows: Now that the Naval Conference is convened here by the five countries of Japan, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in accordance with the Washington and London Treaties, the Japanese Plenipotentiary would like to express his gratitude to the British government for its efforts in various mediation efforts since last year regarding the convening of this conference. He also said that maintaining and promoting international peace is the consistent policy of the Japanese government, so the Japanese government has always sincerely participated in previous disarmament conferences and cooperated with the countries concerned. This conference also wants to achieve a fair and appropriate disarmament agreement, ensure the security of national defense of various countries, reduce the burden on the people, and at the same time attempt to promote world peace and friendship. However, the purpose of this conference is to determine the naval armament of the countries concerned after 1937 and to conclude a comprehensive new naval treaty. The Japanese government believes that when formulating this new treaty, we should determine the common limit that major naval powers in the world should not exceed their holdings, and we must reduce the offensive forces as much as possible as a fundamental measure, and prepare the defensive forces, in order to achieve the actual results of disarmament. At the same time, we must establish a situation of non-threat and non-aggression between countries, and this must be the foundation. The Japanese government really wants to achieve this kind of fair and appropriate disarmament agreement, in order to reduce the burden on the people of various countries and truly contribute to the permanent peace of the world. We firmly believe that this is the best way. Therefore, we follow the above policy, and with a spirit of love for peace, we are willing to work with the plenipotentiaries of various countries, with an open mind and frankness, and to devote ourselves to negotiation. In order to achieve the most just and reasonable new disarmament agreement, we will always sincerely cooperate throughout the process. This is what I want to express. (9th Japan League News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) When the Naval Conference opened this morning, Italian Chief Delegate Ambassador Grandi gave a speech, first expressing his gratitude to the British government for its hospitality, and said, "After thanking the government for representing my country, I should personally thank British Prime Minister Baldwin for the friendly words he issued to us in the opening speech just now. We are now showing the same enthusiasm and friendship in order to live up to the elegance of Prime Minister Baldwin. The Italian government has always spared no effort to prevent the recurrence of the system of unlimited arms competition today. The Italian government is in the current difficult situation, and it has to be cautious, which is well known to you. And this dangerous situation is caused by the attitude of the majority of members of the League of Nations towards Italy, which is also undeniable. However, even though Italy is in this environment, it still attends the Naval Conference today, not only because we still adhere to the principles of limiting armaments and reducing armaments that we have insisted on for many years, and we are participating in the Naval Conference with this spirit as our goal. Since the conclusion of the Washington Naval Treaty, Italy has always hoped that the entire disarmament issue can be resolved in a fair and practical manner. But any solution is not easy to maintain for a long time, so we must gradually study various options and examine in detail the new problems that these various options may cause, in order to decide on a naval restriction plan that can be accepted by all countries. In short, the Italian policy is to prevent arms competition, and this is our consistent goal, and we will never give up." (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>After Baldwin's speech, the U.S. delegation nominated British Foreign Secretary Hoare as the chairman of the conference, and Naval Secretary Monsell as the vice-chairman. Following Italy, they nominated British Foreign Office official Hallman as the secretary-general. (9th National Dispatch)</p>

On Tuesday, they will meet to discuss the procedures and appoint committees. The method is the same as the previous naval conference. The delegates from various countries all expect that there will not be many formal meetings held at the meeting place, because much of the work will be done in bilateral meetings in hotels. The delegates from various countries have now contacted each other to exchange opening speeches. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Cairo: Reports indicate that the recent riot resulted in 18 injuries and 75 arrests. Today, the cabinet authorized the police to open fire on demonstrating crowds.

The British police chief, Russell, ordered them to disperse, but they ignored him. He then charged into the crowd, single-handedly knocking down over a dozen rioters. The remaining crowd was dispersed by police reserves. (National News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Students and troublemakers not only set fire to trams and threw stones at police today, but also chopped down trees and smashed streetlights.

The Minister of the Interior has now announced a ban on all future demonstrations. The police may use firearms when necessary. The authorities will take all possible measures to protect lives and property. The disturbances in Cairo and Egypt in recent weeks are the result of the Nationalist Party's opposition to the pro-British stance of the Egyptian Prime Minister and dissatisfaction with British policies towards Egypt, especially those related to the Egyptian constitution. There are fears that today's riots may escalate, so Egyptian infantry and cavalry have been ordered to deploy for defense. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Today, Britain and France agreed to give Mussolini another opportunity to reach a settlement with Abyssinia based on the League of Nations' conditions. If Mussolini refuses, Britain and France will jointly intensify sanctions against Italy to economically cripple the country. This agreement is the result of a meeting between French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare. Previously, Mussolini had rejected the peace plan tentatively proposed by the two countries. However, Laval and Hoare were undeterred and decided to formally present it to Italy in a near-final ultimatum, while also submitting the proposal to the League of Nations. Furthermore, Hoare and Laval reportedly agreed to find a way to bring Germany back into the League of Nations in February next year and to revive the issue of limiting land and air armaments. If Mussolini or any member of the League of Nations rejects the Anglo-French peace plan, then the peace talks will be abandoned, and further discussions will be postponed until Mussolini seeks peace. This plan does not stipulate the suspension of sanctions during the peace negotiations. Diplomats say that the complete coordination between Britain and France since the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is truly embodied in this plan. (National News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare met for over two hours this morning, continuing discussions in the afternoon.

The British now believe that Mussolini will have to consider this plan as the basis for judgment, as it is neither pro-British nor pro-French, but 100% aligned with the interests of both central powers. At the end of this morning's meeting, those responsible stated that the two officials had worked painstakingly to formulate recommendations, demonstrating their sincere desire to find a basis for negotiations as soon as possible to submit to the Italian government and the League of Nations. British Foreign Secretary Hoare has been advised by doctors to rest and departed from Paris for Switzerland tonight. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

It is said that Mussolini's tone in his address to the Senate will be more moderate, making the Anglo-French efforts to resolve the East African war hopeful. (National News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Senate held its first meeting today after the summer recess. The Crown Prince and other prominent figures were present. Speaker Federzoni declared that the presence of these dignitaries showed the world the unity of Italy, government and people. Subsequently, the Senate passed a resolution expressing its unwavering confidence in Mussolini. Mussolini's reply was very brief, saying that he would do his utmost to protect Italy's interests in Europe and Africa. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Anglo-French Joint Communiqué</p>
<p>(Paris) Laval released an Anglo-French joint communiqué to the press, which stated, "In the spirit of compromise and the friendship between Britain and France, Foreign Secretary Hoare and I have found a solution for a friendly resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. However, this basis is not yet ready for publication. The British government has not yet been informed of the basis we have agreed upon. After the British government accepts this basis, we will then submit it to the two parties involved, Italy and Abyssinia, and the League of Nations. In short, we are in complete agreement on the desire for a swift, peaceful, and honorable resolution, and we are both satisfied with the results achieved in this discussion." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>British Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet will meet this afternoon to discuss the content of the peace plan agreed upon by Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval in Paris. If approved, they will indicate the procedures for delivering it to Mussolini, Emperor Haile Selassie, and the League of Nations. It is reported that Emperor Haile Selassie has not been formally informed of the peace plan during the discussions by British and French experts in Paris. The prominent British politician Austen Chamberlain recently stated firmly in the House of Commons that any solution deemed acceptable by the League of Nations must be accepted by Abyssinia, as Abyssinia is not to blame in this war. There is no clear sign of agreement with this view in official circles, but some non-official quarters consider it important. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the British and French Foreign Ministers reached an agreement on a plan for the peaceful resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute today, British Foreign Secretary Hoare left Paris at 8:00 PM for St. Moritz, Switzerland, to rest. British Foreign Office expert on Abyssinian affairs, Peterson, returned to London at 8:45 PM to present the plan to British Prime Minister Baldwin for review. If Baldwin approves the plan, Peterson will return to Paris tomorrow night to submit the plan to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and ask for a response by December 12. British Foreign Office Under-Secretary Josias, who came to France with Hoare, will remain in France for several days in a private capacity. French Foreign Office officials believe that the plan drafted by Britain and France should be acceptable to Italy, as this plan makes as many concessions as possible to Italy within the limits allowed by the League of Nations Covenant and the will of Emperor Haile Selassie. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Contents of the Anglo-French Plan</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Havas News Agency's diplomatic correspondent, the main points of the plan for the peaceful resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute agreed upon by Britain and France today are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Grant Abyssinia free navigation to a port on the Red Sea. This port may be the port of Assab in Italian Eritrea. If Italy refuses to cede it, Britain may consider using the port of Zeila in British Somaliland as Abyssinia's outlet to the sea.</p>
<p>(2) Cede most of the Tigray province to Italy.</p>
<p>(3) Within a large part of southern Abyssinia, Italy will enjoy full rights. This territory includes the Ogaden region and the colonial zone west of that region, with its borders extending north to 8 degrees north latitude and east to 36 degrees east longitude. In this colonial zone, the Emperor of Abyssinia retains nominal sovereignty, but it is governed by Italy.</p>
<p>(4) The part of Abyssinia inhabited by the Amhara people (i.e., the main part of Abyssinia) remains independent, but the Emperor of Abyssinia may request economic assistance from the League of Nations. This economic assistance was originally proposed in the recommendations of the Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council, but the full authority of the Italian representative under the Five-Nation Committee's recommendations has now been revoked. It is reported that the most thorny issue during the discussions between the British and French Foreign Ministers was the issue of the affiliation of the holy city of Axum in Abyssinia, as Axum is located in the Tigray province and has been occupied by Italian troops, and Abyssinia is unwilling to give it up. After Laval and Hoare discussed the results, they advocated recognizing Axum as a residential area for the Amhara people of Abyssinia and should be kept as part of an independent Abyssinia. The above Anglo-French proposals are expected to be sent to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for review tonight or tomorrow. The Foreign Office here hopes that Mussolini will respond by December 12, the date of the meeting of the Committee of Eighteen. If Italy's response is satisfactory, Italian representative Aloisi may go to Geneva to negotiate a peace agreement, at which time Britain and France can request the Committee of Eighteen to postpone the passage of the resolution on the oil embargo. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the plan for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute agreed upon by Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare, the general content has been detailed in another telegram from this agency. According to the Paris Echo newspaper, in addition to the Italian port of Assab or the British port of Zeila, the French port of Djibouti can also be regarded as one of Abyssinia's outlets to the sea if necessary. As for the land in Tigray province, although it will be ceded to Italy, the holy city of Axum will still belong to Abyssinia and should be connected to the main part of Abyssinia by a corridor. In addition, the Ogaden region and the Danakil region should also be ceded to Italy. Within the southern colonial zone, a company registered in Italy should be established under the sovereignty of the Emperor of Abyssinia to carry out reclamation and set up a police force to take responsibility for security in that area. At the same time, the Emperor of Abyssinia should sign a mutual assistance treaty with the League of Nations, the content of which should be similar to that advocated by the Five-Nation Committee on September 18, and the Emperor of Abyssinia should hire foreign advisers to implement the mutual assistance plan, and Italian advisers should of course participate. Regarding this matter, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also recently issued a communiqué, which briefly states that "Although Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare have found 'a plan that can be the basis for a friendly resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute,' this plan has not been submitted to the governments of the countries concerned, so now is not the time to publish it. Any news about the content of this plan published by other newspapers should be regarded as speculation." (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed French sources, the peace plan set this time by French Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare caters more to Italy's wishes than any other plan set before. The entire Tigray province, except for the holy city of Axum, and the Ogaden and Danakil regions will be ceded to Italy. Italy will also obtain colonies capable of accommodating 1.5 million people. It is said that Hoare has already agreed to cede land limited in the north by the 8th degree of latitude and in the west by the 36th degree of longitude, reaching south to Ganya and the British Egyptian Sudanese border. This is twice the amount originally agreed to by Britain. Abyssinia will obtain the port of Assab and a corner of land to the sea. If Italy refuses to cede the port, Britain is still willing to cede the port of Zeila in British Somaliland to Abyssinia. As for the Amhara and Woggera provinces of Abyssinia, the King should request protection from the League of Nations, which will assign a technical committee including Italy to handle this matter. This proposal has been sent to British Prime Minister Baldwin. French circles all believe that the British government will accept it, and then a telegram will be sent to Italy and Abyssinia, asking Mussolini to respond before December 12.

<p>The Soviet Union is actively preparing to observe the total solar eclipse in 1936. The Pulkovo Observatory has organized three survey teams.

In addition, the Nanjing Observatory recently sent a letter asking whether Chinese astronomers can go to the Soviet Union to participate in the solar eclipse observation. A new observation pavilion has been built near Moscow at the Kuchino Observatory, which is a Soviet innovation. After several tests, the pavilion has proven to be highly suitable and is not inferior to foreign pavilions, while being simple in structure and convenient to use.

<h3 id="e83">Zhangzhou and Xiamen: Strong Opposition to Rice Tax <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Faces Food Shortage; Rice Merchants Completely Suspend Operations</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Government began collecting rice tax in the Zhangzhou area on December 1st. The Zhangzhou Longxi Tax Bureau established a branch office for the Zhangzhou area rice tax, with the Tax Bureau Chief Wu Qianyao concurrently serving as the collection director. On the 1st, collection officers were dispatched to Shima, Fuhe, Gangkou, Shimei, Fuguan, Chengnai Port, Haicang Xiaogang, and other key locations on land and water to set up tax collection points. Rice merchants in Zhangzhou and Shima suspended exports on November 26th because the tax bureau agreed to temporarily postpone the collection until next month. Therefore, from the 26th to the 30th, 3,000 bags of rice were still exported. After the tax collection was implemented on December 1st, rice merchants immediately suspended all operations and engaged in hoarding. Rice prices in the Zhangzhou area have risen instead, from 8 yuan to 8.45 yuan per shi (100 jin) [approximately 50 kilograms]. Cai Zhuchan, Chairman of the Longxi County Chamber of Commerce, Lin Miaoqing, Chairman of the Shima Chamber of Commerce, Shang De, Chairman of the Haicheng County Chamber of Commerce, and Yang Zhishan, Chairman of the Changtai Chamber of Commerce, jointly telegraphed the Provincial Donation Supervision Committee on the 3rd, requesting them to consult with the Provincial Government to abolish the rice tax. More than 20 public organizations in Zhangzhou and Shima also issued a joint telegram on the same day, earnestly requesting the abolition of the rice tax.</p>
<p>Due to the suspension of rice shipments from Zhangzhou, Xiamen's total rice reserves as of the 5th were approximately 300,000 jin [approximately 150,000 kilograms]. The daily demand for rice is 60,000-70,000 jin [approximately 30,000 - 35,000 kilograms]. It is estimated that the city will run out of rice in about five days. The Rice Industry Association specifically requested the Chamber of Commerce to convene a general meeting to discuss relief measures. The Chamber of Commerce convened a general meeting of representatives from various trade associations at 4:00 PM on the 5th. More than 40 representatives and all members of the Chamber of Commerce's executive and supervisory committees resolved as follows: (1) The resumption of the rice tax in Zhangzhou violates laws and regulations and harms people's food supply. Farmers in Zhangzhou are suspending operations in protest. The city's food supply has been cut off, causing deep concern. A resolution was made to telegraph the central and provincial governments in the name of the general meeting, requesting the abolition of the rice tax in Zhangzhou. (2) According to the report of the rice industry representative, the city's food supply is only sufficient for five days due to the suspension of operations in Zhangzhou. A resolution was made on how to seek relief: 1. A request will be submitted to the City Party Headquarters to convene a general meeting of representatives from all sectors to discuss solutions as soon as possible. 2. A letter will be sent to the Rice Industry Association, ordering all members not to raise rice prices. A telegram will also be sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to appeal for assistance. The telegram to the Executive Yuan states, "To Kong [Xiangxi], Acting President of the Executive Yuan, and Kong, Minister of Finance: The resumption of the rice tax in Zhangzhou not only hinders agricultural development but also violates the central government's clear orders to abolish excessive taxes and the Executive Yuan's instructions that all compulsory collections from the people by central and local governments must first be decided upon in principle by the Central Political Conference and reviewed in content by the Legislative Yuan before they can be established. Farmers in Zhangzhou are protesting and suspending operations. The city's rice supply has been cut off, while imported rice cannot be imported due to foreign exchange issues. The city is facing a food panic, and there is deep concern. We earnestly request that you telegraph the Fujian Provincial Government to immediately suspend the tax collection to uphold the law and maintain the people's food supply. We await your instructions with the utmost urgency. Xiamen City Chamber of Commerce, All Trade Associations of the City, humbly request." (December 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Fuzhou: Financial Relief Urgently Needed <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>--Southeast Bank to be Reorganized--</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Since the Southeast Bank and Tianji Money Shop went bankrupt successively, privately-run money shops have also withdrawn their banknotes from circulation, resulting in a sudden reduction of 2 million yuan in the amount of money circulating in the market and a severe tightening of credit. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting permission to order the Fuzhou Central Bank to allocate 1 million yuan for merchants to use as collateral for loans, using real estate as security, to facilitate financial turnover. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the establishment of a real estate mortgage bank was under overall consideration, but allocating 1 million yuan from the Central Bank for real estate mortgages was inconsistent with the bank's regulations and could not be approved. Currently, the Chamber of Commerce believes that with the Lunar New Year approaching and merchants needing to settle accounts, the entire commercial sector will be paralyzed if finances cannot be activated. It has been decided to discuss relief measures with banks and money shops again within the next few days, which must be implemented by the Lunar New Year at the latest.</p>
<p>After the Southeast Bank suspended operations, the provincial government established a reorganization committee to liquidate debts. For nearly a month, there has been no news of the bank's bills being honored. A few days ago, Chen Ticheng, Chairman of the reorganization committee, flew to Shanghai with Xu Fu, Director of the Provincial Finance Department, to contact the banking industry for assistance and discuss the reorganization plan of the Southeast Bank with Li Qingquan, a director of the Philippine China Bank. He flew back from Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is reported that considerable progress has been made. Regarding the reorganization, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have agreed to transfer 300,000 yuan of the Southeast Bank's collateral to the two banks. The reorganization committee has also recovered 300,000 yuan in debts owed to the Southeast Bank, totaling 600,000 yuan. It is hoped that part of the bills can be honored within the next few days. Regarding the reorganization of the bank, Chen Ticheng and Li Qingquan discussed the possibility of reorganizing it into a Construction Bank, similar to a construction bank corporation, specializing in investing in mining, road construction, electricity, and water conservancy projects in the province. However, the specific measures will have to be discussed in detail after the reorganization of the bank is completed.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the implementation of legal tender in the city, prices once increased. Chen Ticheng, Director of the Construction Department, ordered the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce to convene representatives from various trade associations to investigate the situation. If necessary, a price evaluation committee would be organized to determine price standards. In recent days, the Chamber of Commerce has convened responsible persons from trade associations of daily necessities to inquire about the situation. They all said that the economy was sluggish, purchasing power was weak, and financial turnover was tight. Shops were selling at low prices to clear out inventory. There was no reason to raise prices. As for the price increase of kerosene and flour, the source of supply was the standard, and it was not the deliberate price increase by the merchants in the city. The Chamber of Commerce believes that it is true and has replied to the Construction Department, stating that there is no need to organize a price evaluation committee. (December 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Guangdong Province: Levying Tax on Imported Fruits; Tax Rate is 30% of Value; Restricting the Dumping of Imported Fruits <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Guangdong Province is originally a fruit-producing area. Fruits such as lychees, oranges, pomelos, peaches, and plums are all fine products. Among them, Chaozhou mandarin oranges and Xinhui oranges are the most abundant. However, in recent years, farmers have not paid attention to planting techniques, and the soil has not been properly cared for. As a result, soil fertility has been exhausted, and production has decreased. This has caused great losses to rural by-products. At the same time, due to the decrease in local fruit production, foreign fruits have taken the opportunity to be imported. Up to now, imported fruits account for a large portion of imports. The authorities have specifically implemented a tax on imported fruits to restrict them and promote the sale of local products. The tax on imported fruits has been announced by the Finance Department and will be collected starting from the 6th of this month. The tax rates for imported fruits are as follows: "According to the review by the Finance Department and the Construction Department, regarding the case presented by the Chaozhou-Meizhou Customs Superintendent to prohibit the dumping of Dutch fruits in Guangdong, this Department, after review, determined that a special tax of 30% should be levied on all coconuts, raisins, and other unnamed dried and fresh fruits imported from Nanyang. This was jointly submitted to the Guangdong Provincial Government and forwarded to the 197th Political Conference of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government for approval. This Department issued General Order No. 5215, instructing all special tax bureaus for imported agricultural products to comply with the order and post it for public notice. Now, upon reviewing the current regulations for the collection of special taxes on imported agricultural products and miscellaneous items in Guangdong Province, it has been stipulated that apples, coconuts, Golden Hill oranges, lemons, grapes, and Luzon mangoes (the above fresh fruits, in addition to the provincial Chen Fresh Vegetable and Salted Goods Row fee, are taxed at 9.06 yuan per unit) Siamese pomelos, coconuts, betel nuts, tomatoes, unnamed fresh fruits, dried plums, dried apples, coconut shreds, American pine, hairy fruits, yellow branch dried fruits, western branch dried apricots, large and small canned olives, canned miscellaneous fruits, dried chestnut meat, large raisins, almonds (dried chestnut meat, large raisins, and almonds are subject to the Beijing Fruit and Seafood Donation, actually charged at 9.6 yuan), and unnamed dried vegetables are all taxed at 12 yuan per 100 yuan of cargo value, which should have been followed and enforced. Now, a special tax of 30% will be levied on all coconuts, raisins, and other unnamed dried and fresh fruits imported from Nanyang. All kinds of imported fruits stipulated in the previous regulations should be changed to 30% together to facilitate inspection and prevent dumping. The original 2.94 yuan deducted for apples, coconuts, Golden Hill oranges, lemons, grapes, and Luzon mangoes for the Provincial Chen Fresh Fruit Row fee is no longer deducted as the fee has been abolished. The 2.4 yuan for dried chestnut meat, large raisins, and almonds is still deducted for the Beijing Fruit and Seafood Donation, in accordance with the approved calculation, in order to comply with the fixed plan. In addition to submitting a report and issuing separate orders, this is hereby promulgated so that all merchants and people in the jurisdiction are informed and must comply with the above matters and report and pay the tax separately from December 6th of this year without violation."

He specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, requesting that the receipt and exchange of copper and silver coins by the three banks be allowed to circulate in and out of the market in order to avoid disturbances.</p>

Xu Fengchi, another suspect, was also sentenced to death. Xu Fengchi refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court, which declared him not guilty. Zhuang Shigen, another suspect, was originally sentenced to life imprisonment by the court. Later, he hired lawyer Wu Chengkui to defend him in court, and the High Court changed his sentence to 12 years of imprisonment. Zhuang Shigen still refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the third instance. The Supreme Court changed his sentence to six years of imprisonment. He was sent back to the county's Fifth Prison for execution on the 7th.</p>

She refused to accept it, so she sent a postman to report it to the county magistrate. Magistrate Hou immediately sent clerk Huang Bingzhong to the post office to open the parcel and inspect it together with Director Zhuang. They found shredded mutton and a package of smoked opium weighing approximately 1103 grams. Since the case involved smuggling, Director Zhuang sent a letter to the county government, along with Zhang Wangshi and the evidence, for detention. Zhou Shunbao and his mother, Dai, were also arrested and brought to the county for investigation.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs Office, considering Nantong as a non-treaty port for loading and unloading goods, stationed staff at the Tianshenggang wharf to inspect goods and issue inspection slips. Merchants would take the slips to the Jianghai Customs Office or the Zhenjiang Customs Office to pay taxes. The Ministry of Finance has decided to cancel the Nantong branch post on January 1, 1936. The Nantong County Chamber of Commerce believes that Nantong's local cloth is sold to Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces, with an annual value of over 10 million yuan. If all of it is transferred through Shanghai in the future, it will inevitably increase costs. Furthermore, if goods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are transferred from Zhenjiang to Tongzhou, it will cause even more delays. Because it greatly affects the industry and commerce of the Tongzhou area, a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Finance, requesting them to withdraw the order.</p>

<p>Labor-Capital Coordination (Continued) by Zhu Tongjiu</p>
<p>IV. General Methods of Labor-Capital Coordination. There are three methods of labor-capital coordination:</p>
<p>(1) Conciliation. Conciliation is when a benevolent third party or government representative, when a labor-capital dispute is about to occur or has already occurred, acts as an intermediary to bring the two parties closer to each other and reach a collective agreement. Conciliation can be divided into two types:</p>
<p>A. Preventive Conciliation. The significance of preventive conciliation is that when a labor-capital dispute is brewing, the feelings of both labor and capital are approaching a breaking point, and the behavior of labor and capital conflict has not yet manifested. At this time, a second party who knows that both labor and capital hold firm opinions and will eventually conflict, comes forward to act as an intermediary for benevolent conciliation, so that both parties make concessions to eliminate the disaster in the invisible. According to this type of conciliation, it is easy to start and easy to succeed before the feelings of both parties are damaged, which is called preventive conciliation.</p>
<p>B. Ex Post Conciliation. Ex post conciliation refers to the fact that labor and capital have already had a dispute. After a labor dispute occurs, the situation is serious. On one side, a strike is declared or a riot is premeditated, and on the other side, the power of the military and police is used to prepare for suppression. A bloody tragedy is inevitable. At this time, a third party, unwilling to see the vicious fighting between labor and capital affecting social security, comes forward to invite the parties concerned to a meeting to resolve the difficulties. However, ex post conciliation can be divided into arbitrary conciliation and compulsory conciliation:</p>
<p>a. Arbitrary Conciliation. Whether or not labor and capital are willing to accept conciliation is up to the decision of both parties and has no binding force. If either party of labor and capital is unwilling to accept conciliation, then the effectiveness of conciliation is immediately lost. In arbitrary conciliation, there are so-called passive conciliation and active conciliation. In passive conciliation, even if the conciliation mechanism has been organized, whether both parties are willing to use it is up to the convenience of both parties concerned. For example, the French conciliation regulations of 1892 are so stipulated. As for active conciliation, local officials are responsible for advising both parties to adhere to the principle of peace and not insist on their own opinions. However, they have no power to force both parties to accept.</p>
<p>b. Compulsory Conciliation. Compulsory conciliation is different from arbitrary conciliation. After government representatives and local officials act as conciliators, both parties must accommodate the conciliation opinions, otherwise the state will come out and enforce them compulsorily. For example, the conciliation regulations of Sweden, etc., are so stipulated.</p>
<p>(2) Investigation. The meaning of investigation is that government agencies or investigation courts conduct thorough investigations of labor-capital disputes and officially announce various facts to the public, so that the public can understand the truth of the dispute and have concrete and powerful public opinion. If public opinion is dissatisfied with labor or capital, it will make labor or capital aware of their own mistakes, voluntarily withdraw the dispute, and return to peace. This is the so-called reference to social sanctions to eliminate social disputes. However, the effectiveness of the investigation system is extremely small, so in fact, fewer people adopt it.</p>
<p>(3) Arbitration. Arbitration has the nature of a public judgment. Because the above two methods are not easy to be effective, countries have established arbitration mechanisms to deal with labor-capital disputes. But in practice, countries start with conciliation first. If conciliation fails, it is immediately followed by arbitration. Therefore, the arbitration mechanism is nothing less than the highest court for labor-capital reconciliation. Arbitration can also be divided into arbitrary arbitration and compulsory arbitration. Arbitrary arbitration is only possible with the consent of both labor and capital. Furthermore, the result of the judgment has no power to force both parties to comply. Therefore, arbitrary arbitration is not as effective as compulsory arbitration. This is because compulsory arbitration is based on the laws promulgated by the state. Once a judgment is made, both parties must abide by it, otherwise severe penalties will be imposed.</p>
<p>V. Changes in China's Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law. According to the first Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law promulgated by the National Government in 1928, China adopted a compulsory arbitration system. In March 1930, the Legislative Yuan amended it and changed it to arbitrary arbitration. However, after it was changed to arbitrary arbitration, the arbitration ruling lacked compulsory force in law and could not bind both labor and capital to accept the ruling. Therefore, after the January 28th Shanghai War, the labor unrest in Shanghai was surging. Due to the relationship of arbitrary arbitration, labor-capital disputes were not easily resolved for a time, and society was greatly affected. For example, the labor-capital dispute of the Sanyou Industrial Company dragged on for years, from conciliation to arbitration, and from arbitration to court litigation, which was delayed and unresolved, and both parties suffered great losses. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, realized this and proposed to the Central Political Conference to restore compulsory arbitration. Later, the Legislative Yuan revised the Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law and restored the former compulsory arbitration system. Therefore, China's laws on labor-capital disputes have been changed repeatedly, but based on factual relations, it is felt that compulsory arbitration is actually more effective than arbitrary arbitration.</p>
<p>As for the main points of compulsory arbitration, it can be divided into five: (1) Labor-capital disputes must be submitted to arbitration after conciliation has no results. (2) Witnesses must testify and submit witness statements. (3) Lockouts and strikes are prohibited when conciliation evidence is being reviewed and judgments are being made. (4) Arbitration must be ruled and announced. (5) The ruling must be enforced and no objection may be raised. Lockouts and strikes are prohibited during the effective period, and violators will be fined or imprisoned.</p>
<p>Since the restoration of the compulsory arbitration system, labor-capital disputes in Shanghai have indeed decreased compared to before. From this, it can be seen that the effectiveness of compulsory arbitration is actually greater than that of arbitrary arbitration. The author personally advocated that the government adopt compulsory arbitration in the past because the government can exercise its control power to eliminate labor-capital disputes in the invisible.</p>
<p>VI. Italy's Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law. Among the labor-capital dispute handling laws of various countries, Italy's law is the most stringent. Strikes and lockouts are all prohibited. All labor-capital disputes are resolved by the labor court's legal decision. After its implementation, the effect is remarkable and the results are excellent. It is specially introduced below for reference by the Chinese people and as the end of this article.</p>
<p>The law promulgated by the Italian government on April 3, 1926, stipulates that if a factory is closed without reason to force workers to accept conditions lower than those stipulated in the collective agreement, the government will fine the employer 10,000 to 100,000 lire. At the same time, if a strike is used to seek conditions higher than those stipulated in the contract, the government will also fine the workers 100 to 1,000 lire. In addition to paying the fine, strike leaders must also be imprisoned for one or two years. Furthermore, the Italian government's definition of a strike is very strict. Any cessation of work by more than three people requesting employers to provide treatment beyond the contract is considered a strike.</p>
<p>Workers in public agencies, such as postal and telecommunications workers, who strike without reason should be imprisoned for one or six months and suspended from work for six months. Strike leaders should be imprisoned for six months or two years and suspended from work for more than three years. As for employers of a public utility nature, if they close a factory without reason, they should pay a fine of 9,000 to 100,000 lire and be imprisoned for six months or one year.</p>
<p>The Italian government not only prohibits economic strikes but also prohibits political strikes. Because political strikes are sufficient to damage the government's prestige. Therefore, the penalties for those who participate in this type of strike are even more severe. It is stipulated that all those who participate in a strike should be imprisoned for one or three years. Those who instigate this type of strike should be imprisoned for three or seven years and permanently deprived of the right to work.</p>

<p>After the implementation of the Ministry of Finance's new currency policy, it has yielded considerable results. Three banks handle interbank overdrafts, and silver firms accept mortgages in accordance with regulations. The increase in funds in the market has gradually revitalized it. As the year-end bank closing approaches, all lending is temporarily tightened. The market interest rate for foreign exchange has fallen. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Handling Overdrafts and Accepting Mortgages</p>
<p>After the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications received an order from the Ministry of Finance to handle interbank overdrafts, the total amount is determined at any time depending on the market, allocated according to a 4-4-2 ratio, and managed by the Central Bank's Business Bureau according to established practice. Silver firms that have business relations with the three banks can apply for overdrafts. The Silver Firms Association, upon receiving an order from the Ministry of Finance to accept mortgages from various firms in accordance with regulations, has instructed its members to comply. Now, all banks and silver firms have complied with the ministry's order.</p>
<p>New Policies Take Effect, Market Revitalizes</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's new currency policy has been quite effective. The increase in funds in the market alleviates concerns about shortages. At the same time, the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are handling interbank overdrafts, and the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Examination Committee is handling industrial and commercial credit loans. Various industries are promoting commercial acceptance drafts, thus gradually revitalizing the market. The daily announced interest rate for foreign exchange in the silver market, such as today's drop to eight percent, sufficiently proves that the money supply in Shanghai has eased.</p>
<p>Bank Closing, Lending Tightens</p>
<p>As the year-end bank closing for the Republic of China's 24th year is approaching, the Bankers Association has scheduled its 9th Members' General Assembly to report on association affairs at 4:00 PM on the 28th. Banks are very busy preparing for the year-end closing. All new loans will be temporarily tightened during this closing period and will be reviewed and released after the closing. According to reporters from Xin Sheng She who inquired in banking circles, despite the economic depression, member banks of the Bankers Association are expected to still make a profit this year.</p>
<p>Silver Firms to Discuss Year-End Closing</p>
<p>The year-end closing for the Republic of China's 24th year in Shanghai's various industries has always been based on the silver industry. The Silver Firms Association will submit the issue of the year-end closing period to the next members' representatives meeting for discussion and decision.

<h3 id="e97">Determining Method for Foreign Banks to Exchange Silver for Legal Tender; Xu Kan Returns to Shanghai After Visiting the Minister of Finance <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that after foreign banks were ordered to surrender silver for exchange into legal tender, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Bankers Association held several meetings and decided to have the chairman, Mr. Kirkhope of the Mercantile Bank, and Mr. Yabuki Keiichi of the Yokohama Specie Bank, visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Vice Minister Xu Kan to offer opinions. It was decided to exchange legal tender for silver with 60% cash and 40% guarantee through the three banks. Vice Minister Xu Kan went to Nanjing to visit Finance Minister Kong for instructions and returned to Shanghai at 7:15 AM yesterday. He went to the Central Bank to work at around 10:00 AM. It is reported that all procedures for the case of foreign banks exchanging silver for legal tender have also been decided.</p>
<p>Hua Dong She reports that Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan will continue to negotiate with foreign banks and report the results for instructions. It is also learned that foreign businesses have agreed to the exchange, but the official exchange rate set by the Central Bank cannot be close to that of London, so the exchange of legal tender must be settled according to the London exchange rate, and the exchange period is also under consideration. The minting machines ordered by the Central Bank from the United States have now arrived here and will soon begin minting new subsidiary coins of silver and copper to stabilize the market.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Change Train Schedules; Effective December 21st; Highlights of the Newly Revised Train Schedule <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The train schedules for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been in effect since they were revised on July 1st of last year and have been in use for over a year. In May of this year, the Ministry of Railways convened the 9th National Railway Transportation Conference, which resolved to improve the speed of passenger and freight trains on various lines, shorten schedules, and increase transportation efficiency. The two railway administrations were ordered to draft specific proposals for review. The vehicle and machine departments jointly consulted and, based on the principle of increasing speed and reducing the number of stops, made improvements and drafted new passenger and freight train schedules for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The existing schedules for the Shanghai-Xiang section and the Shanghai-Song section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are still able to meet current needs and have not been changed. On the Cao-Ning section, only train No. 254 is advanced by five minutes from Ningbo Station, and train No. 257 is advanced by five minutes from Yuyao Station; the rest remains the same. Regarding the Shanghai-Ping through train, the Ministry ordered consultation with representatives of the Tianjin-Pukou and Beining Railways to change the train schedule. However, since the time saved after the change was limited, and the Ministry's principle of handing over cars on the south bank could not be maintained, and there were conflicts with the connection times of the Jiaoji and Longhai Railways, it was agreed with the Tianjin-Pukou and Beining Railways to maintain the status quo. The new train schedule, the changes to passenger and freight trains, and the explanation of the reasons have now been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and will be implemented from December 21st. The features of the newly revised schedule are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Increased Speed, Shortened Travel Time</p>
<p>(A) The first, second, third, and fourth express trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line originally required six hours and thirty minutes to six hours and forty-five minutes for the entire journey. Now, it only takes five hours and forty-five minutes to reach the destination, with the latest being five hours and fifty-five minutes, a reduction of more than half an hour compared to the current schedule. (B) The 21st and 22nd express trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line originally required nine hours and five minutes and nine hours for the entire journey. Now, it only takes eight hours and fifteen minutes and seven hours and forty minutes, a reduction of about one hour compared to the current schedule. (C) The 41st and 42nd slow trains of the third and fourth classes on the Beijing-Shanghai line, which are currently the 71st and 72nd slow trains of the third and fourth classes, originally required twelve hours and ten minutes and twelve hours and twenty-five minutes for the entire journey. Now, it only takes ten hours and fifty-five minutes and eleven hours and fifteen minutes, a reduction of more than one hour compared to the current schedule. (D) The first and second special express trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line originally required four hours and forty minutes and four hours and forty-five minutes. Now, it only takes four hours and fifteen minutes. The 11th and 12th special express trains originally required four hours and fifty-five minutes and five hours and five minutes. Now, it only takes four hours and thirty minutes and four hours and thirty-five minutes, a reduction of about half an hour compared to the current schedule. (E) The 21st, 32nd, 33rd, and 34th express trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line have also been reduced by about half an hour compared to the current schedule. In addition, the slow trains of the third and fourth classes have also been reduced by varying amounts.</p>
<p>Limiting the Number of Cars; The number of cars attached to each passenger train used to vary, and if the limit of the engine power was exceeded, it would easily lead to slow travel. Now, the number is strictly limited according to the engine capacity to reduce delays.</p>
<p>Reducing the Number of Stops; Special express trains and express trains take at least five or six minutes to stop at each station. Now, the first, second, and fourth trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line will cancel stops at Kunshan Station, the 21st train will cancel stops at Shizi, Xinfeng, Xinzha Town, and Shitangwan stations, and the 22nd train will cancel stops at Guandu Li, Xin 高资, Xia Shu, Lou Shan, and five stations. The 12th express train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line will cancel stops at Fengjing Station, the 31st and 32nd trains will cancel stops at Xujiahui Station, and the 33rd train will cancel stops at Xieqiao and Linping stations to shorten travel time and reduce the boredom of long-distance travelers.</p>
<p>Adding Intercity Express and Express Trains; (A) After the Shanghai-Ping through train departs from the North Shanghai Station at 4:00 PM, there are no express or special express trains available on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Now, the current 78th Shanghai-Changzhou mixed third and fourth class intercity train will be changed to the 24th Shanghai-Changzhou special express intercity train, departing from Shanghai at 4:50 PM and arriving at Suzhou Station at 6:43 PM, Wuxi Station at 7:37 PM, and Changzhou Station at 8:35 PM. The travel time is shortened by one hour and twenty-two minutes to two hours and thirty minutes compared to the current schedule. Passengers within the Changzhou-Shanghai section can return home earlier and have ample time to stay in Shanghai. (B) The current 77th Changzhou-Shanghai second, third, and fourth class mixed intercity train on the Beijing-Shanghai line departs from Changzhou too early. There are no express or special trains available in the Shanghai-Changzhou section in the morning. Now, the departure time from Changzhou will be delayed to 8:00 AM and changed to the 23rd express train.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Seats of the Third and Fourth Class Cars; The number of third and fourth class passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai line is greater in the afternoon than in the morning. The three trains departing first are overcrowded, and later arrivals have almost no room to stand, while the later trains have few passengers. Now, the current 73rd Changzhou-Shanghai second and fourth class mixed intercity train will be changed to the 45th Wuxi-Shanghai third and fourth class intercity train, departing from Wuxi to accommodate as many passengers as possible in the Wuxi-Shanghai section. The current 41st Beijing-Shanghai first and fourth class train will be changed to the 43rd Zhenjiang-Shanghai third and fourth class intercity train, departing from Zhenjiang West Station to accommodate as many passengers as possible in the Zhenjiang-Suzhou section. After passing Suzhou Station, the number of stops will be reduced as much as possible to shorten travel time and limit the number of passengers to alleviate congestion. Passengers in the Beijing-Zhenjiang section and late-arriving passengers at various stations along the way can take the last 41st train.</p>
<p>Adding a Midday Express Train to Beijing; There is currently no midday express train departing from Nanjing Station on the Beijing-Shanghai line. After the 21st express train departs at 9:30 AM, passengers must wait until 5:00 PM for the 3rd special express train. Now, the 21st express train will be delayed to 12:35 PM from Beijing.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Departure Time of Passenger Trains from the North Shanghai Station</p>
<p>The 22nd express train on the Beijing-Shanghai line currently departs from Shanghai at 9:00 AM, which is too close to the departure time of the 4th special express train. After the 22nd train departs, passengers must wait until 1:10 PM for the next special express train. Now, the 22nd express train will be delayed to 9:50 AM from Shanghai to adjust the departure time.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Dutch Government is Cracking Down on Chinese People Going to Java <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Passports and Deng Po Papers are Required to Purchase Tickets and Board Ships</p>
<p>Dutch shipping companies operating in the East Indies, the South Seas Islands, and Java have recently decided to reduce prices due to sluggish business and few passengers. In addition, the Dutch government is strictly cracking down on the entry of Chinese workers and has added restrictions on the sale of ship tickets. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Passports Required for Java</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese people going to the South Seas Islands and ports such as Surabaya and Semarang in Dutch Java, such as laborers and workers, could enter the country by paying a head tax of 150 guilders and obtaining a Deng Po paper. Now, the Dutch authorities have strictly cracked down, and all those going to Java are considered as businessmen and tourists. The previously established practice of relying solely on Deng Po papers is no longer valid. The shipping companies traveling between China and Java are hereby notified that all Chinese people going to Java, regardless of whether they purchase tickets in Shanghai, Xiamen, or elsewhere, and regardless of whether they are new or old passengers, must apply for a Chinese passport. When purchasing ship tickets, they must first present their passport and Deng Po paper (commonly known as yellow paper). If either is missing, they may not purchase ship tickets. The local Zha Hua Shipping Company has complied with this new rule. Going to the South Seas will be very difficult for Chinese people in the future.</p>
<p>Dutch Ships to Discuss Ticket Price Reductions</p>
<p>The South Seas passenger ships of the Zha Hua Shipping Company also sail to Xiamen and Hong Kong. Shanghai passengers have always been crowded. This year, after China Merchants, Jardine Matheson, and others added new ships to the South China route, ticket prices were reduced, and the business of Dutch shipping has been slightly affected. The company has been discussing for days to reduce the ticket prices for each class on the Shanghai-Xiamen section to salvage the situation. As a result of the discussion, it is proposed that the first-class cabin from Shanghai to Xiamen be reduced from 85 yuan to 70 yuan, the second-class cabin from 60 yuan to 50 yuan, the third-class cabin from 35 yuan to 30 yuan, and the steerage cabin from 15 yuan to 12.5 yuan. For those going to Hong Kong, the first-class cabin is reduced from 110 yuan to 100 yuan, the second-class cabin from 60 yuan to 50 yuan, the third-class cabin from 35 yuan to 30 yuan, and the steerage cabin from 20 yuan to 17.5 yuan. These new ticket prices are scheduled to take effect from the next Vanikela.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Zhabei Charity Association Appeals to All Sectors for Funds to Establish Soup Kitchens <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Association of this city has issued a circular appealing to wealthy merchants and gentry in Shanghai for funds to urgently establish soup kitchens as winter approaches. The circular states: "Shanghai is a major commercial metropolis, and Zhabei is a factory district. The market is generally sluggish, and factories are bound to close. The working class faces extreme hardship. Every year during the harsh winter, the establishment of soup kitchens is eagerly anticipated by the poor. For the sake of stability, we cannot avoid establishing them. While we were raising funds, we received Instruction No. 11920 from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which stated that this year's floods in various provinces have been exceptionally severe, and the countryside is desolate. Countless impoverished victims of the disaster are fleeing to Shanghai. Coupled with the economic depression and the decline of all industries, it is difficult for the suffering people to obtain food and clothing. This year's situation is particularly dire, and it is even more necessary to establish soup kitchens. We are hereby ordered to begin preparations early." We are immediately complying and expediting preparations. In addition to requesting funds from the municipal government for promotion, we urgently appeal to the wealthy merchants and gentry of Shanghai, stating: "Soup kitchens fill stomachs. A single grain enters the belly. In the harsh winter, receiving a full meal in the early morning is invigorating and warming, not just filling the stomach. There is no greater virtue than this." We are currently constructing sheds and repairing pots at Beiliuying Road, and actively preparing. However, according to past practice, each factory serves over 10,000 people, requiring 30 to 40 piculs of rice per day. Based on a two-month budget, we need over 2,000 piculs of rice, totaling over 30,000 silver dollars. Our association has no permanent assets and relies entirely on the generous donations of benefactors. We will not send anyone out to solicit donations.

<p>The Steamboat Trade Association of this city, in view of the recent increase in prices and the soaring costs of hardware, materials, machinery, and iron plates used by the steamboat industry due to foreign exchange rates, as well as the general increase in prices of daily necessities such as coal, which has led to huge expenses for steamboats, has decided at its 37th Executive Committee meeting to increase freight fares on all routes by 20% starting next month, in order to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Shelter for the Destitute Prepared, Municipal Government Allocates 2,000 Yuan <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi of the United Charity Association of this city, in order to provide relief to the hungry and cold common people of this city, and complying with the request of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, are organizing temporary shelters for the destitute as usual. They have entrusted Director Zhang Zixin to negotiate with the board of directors of the Chaozhou Guild Hall at the South Railway Station and the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road to allocate the remaining houses for use. After days of arrangement and preparation, everything has been completed. However, the Chao Hui Villa is still occupied by the city's security team. They are currently looking for vacant houses elsewhere and will request the team to relocate as soon as they find one. The Association had previously reported the progress of preparations to the municipal government and requested an additional allocation of funds. Yesterday, they received an instruction stating: "Having reviewed the report, considering the strained financial situation of the city treasury, an allocation of 2,000 yuan is tentatively approved to meet the essential needs for operating the shelter for the destitute. The Finance Bureau is hereby instructed. Please take note of this order." The Association has prepared a letter and sent personnel to collect the funds in order to proceed with the operation. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the municipal government had approved a subsidy of over 11,000 yuan, which was actually raised by the Association from various charities. However, this year's floods in various provinces have been severe, leading to the bankruptcy of rural areas, economic depression, and an increasing number of unemployed people and impoverished citizens. At this time of severe cold, those suffering from cold and hunger are everywhere. It is expected that the number of people registering and requesting shelter will be even greater than in previous years. Mr. Zhang, the person in charge of the shelter, believes that it is particularly difficult to raise funds this year. He plans to save on internal staff and all expenses in order to save more impoverished citizens. He sincerely hopes that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will generously donate cotton clothing, rice, and other items, which should be sent to the Renji Shantang on Liu Malu. The Association will issue receipts and publish acknowledgments in the newspaper.</p>

It is currently preparing donation reports to show transparency. The Industry News reporter has obtained the following details:</p>
<p>Work Relief Completed</p>
<p>The Association, because Zhejiang Province has suffered repeated floods and droughts in recent years, causing widespread poverty, and in order to provide universal relief, organized winter relief last year, donating rice and clothing for distribution to the disaster areas, which was a great achievement. Before the end of the winter relief, it continued to organize spring relief, utilizing the collective strength of able-bodied men to benefit the local areas. Those receiving relief grain were instructed to follow the plan and, under the guidance of the directors of each work relief project, open and dredge the river courses to facilitate transportation and prevent disasters. It is now learned that the work relief projects organized by the Association have been completed. A total of thirteen counties have been completed, including Jiaxing, Haiyan, Chongde, Tongxiang, Haining, Yuhang, Wukang, Deqing, Shangyu, Xinchang, Kuaiji County, Shaoxing, and Yuyao. The work relief directors of each county have successively reported to the Association.</p>
<p>End of Month Conclusion</p>
<p>It is learned that the Association believes that the main counties and river courses within Zhejiang Province have been dredged completely. It has instructed all subordinate directors to formally conclude their operations by the end of this month. The accounts of donations from all parties have been handed over to selected certified public accountants for detailed verification. A general report will be prepared at the end of the month, and a WeChat record will be printed and distributed to all sectors and donors for review to show transparency. It is heard that in addition to the work relief projects in the thirteen counties mentioned above, which have been completed directly by the Association, the work relief project in Shangyu County, which is still in progress, involves dredging branch rivers and opening Xiaogang to draw water from the Cao'e River to irrigate over 50,000 mu of morning fields.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Headquarters of the Air Association's General Team: 37th Office Meeting <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Air Association held its 37th office meeting at 2:00 PM on the 7th at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge to discuss the direction of all fundraising efforts. Attendees included Secretary-General Li Dachao, Directors Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Bao Lengxue, Gu Shangrui, Chen Shuo, Huang Jun, Shou Zheng, Liu Songtao, Lu Zhangyan, Yang Peiwen, Wei Jianxin, Zhu Shengyang, Li Jiming, Zhang Xiamin, and Li Huiran. Li Dachao chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo took the minutes. The chairman reported that all the fundraising teams were working very hard to solicit donations. The general office in Japan had sent a letter urging them to step up activities and submit results in order to complete the fundraising in stages. In recent days, the payment of membership fees and donations has been extremely crowded. Field officers should fully promote and assist in the process to increase results and complete the fundraising as soon as possible. Regarding direct solicitation of members, the office had requested applications after publishing announcements, and compatriots in this city had actively participated. Even people from distant provinces and cities such as Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Fujian, and Zhejiang had sent letters to join as members and pay their membership fees, which was very enthusiastic. This shows that the public is enthusiastic about supporting the aviation to save the country movement. The Shanghai office will continue to solicit members individually in order to increase its strength. All mid-level and above personnel must contact individuals to join the Association in order to promote it widely. The China Flying Society officially established on National Day has begun operating at Lubanfang on Luban Road and has begun soliciting members. The Society is purely for the purpose of researching aviation academics and promoting civil aviation, assisting the government in developing civil aviation. Members are divided into three types: ex officio, special, and ordinary. A large number of people are participating. The Flying Society's training course has recently begun training junior civil aviation personnel at the Longhua Airport. The Aviation to Save the Country Mobile Simple Exhibition in the South Shanghai district will last for almost a month. A large number of people are visiting, and details have been reported repeatedly. It has been decided to officially open the exhibition on the 10th of this month and move it to the Fourth Times Middle School, starting on the 16th of this month. The collection of aviation to save the country donations from the brick and tile transportation, sand and stone industry, private shipping industry, and hotel industry has been very successful. It is hoped that the inspection directors will do their best to assist in the process. The restaurant, cinema, and prostitution industries are all areas of consumption. Efforts should be made to promote the collection of aviation to save the country donations, starting with an initial investigation and contact, and then proceeding with the process. After the directors reported on the progress of the interviews and investigations, the meeting discussed several fundraising proposals until it adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Final Instance: Wang Deyu Sentenced to Death, Judgment Rendered by Supreme Court <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Murderer Wang Deyu (whose father's original surname was Ding, but he became an adopted son of the Wang family and his son Deyu took the Wang surname) is 28 years old, an ironworker, and from Wuxi. In the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1933], he plotted to seize his uncle's inheritance. On October 15th of that year, at noon, he lured his cousin Ding Fugen (13 years old, whose father's family-run Ding Juxing Iron Shop was located at 658 Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai. After his father's death, his mother, Ding Yin, continued to run the shop) from the front of the Sino-French School in Baxianqiao in the French Concession (Ding was a student at the school and boarded at his aunt's house on Laohe Road because of the inconvenient commute) to a cotton field in Yijiazhai of the Longhua Cement Factory, where he beat him to death with an iron implement. After the crime, Deyu fled without a trace. After investigation, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau arrested a suspect named Zhou Ayuan from Jiangyin, who confessed that Wang was hiding in the Quanqui Inn in Nanxiang Town. Detectives rushed to the scene overnight and arrested Wang, who was brought to Shanghai for interrogation. Because the crime originated in the French Concession, the French police sent detectives to the Public Security Bureau to take back the two suspects, Wang and Zhou, and send them to the Second Special District Court. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution for premeditated murder. The initial trial sentenced Wang Deyu to death for premeditated murder, and deprived him of civil rights for life. Zhou Ayuan was found not guilty. Later, Zhou was released after the Police Department did not appeal. However, Wang refused to accept the death sentence and appealed to the Third High Court, hoping to evade punishment and blaming his brother-in-law Tang Aming for the murder of Ding Fugen. After repeated court hearings, the High Court found that Wang's grounds for appeal were empty and unfounded, and the evidence of the crime was solid. The court rejected his appeal. Wang still refused to accept the sentence and filed a third appeal to the Supreme Court. The suspect is still being held in the detention center of the Second Special District Court. It has now been learned that the Supreme Court has reviewed the entire case file and still believes that Wang's crime is certain. The court has ruled in the case of Wang Deyu's appeal against the murder conviction, stating: "The original judgment is reversed regarding the criminal sentence. Wang Deyu is sentenced to death for murder and deprived of civil rights for life." This judgment will be executed in accordance with the law after approval by the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p>Liu Zirong, the third and youngest son of Liu Huizhi, the former general manager of the China Industrial Bank, married Xi Yunqing (also known as Yunqing), the daughter of the paint tycoon Xi Ehan. In late spring of last year, Xi Yunqing had a love affair with the chauffeur Wu Wenxiang, and the two eloped, hiding in a pavilion at 84 Qianjiatang Wu Jialong in the French Concession. Recently, the Liu family reported to the police, who sent officers to arrest both Xi and Wu. They were handed over to the Public Security Bureau and sent to the local court for interrogation and detention. This matter has been reported in previous newspapers. It has now been learned that the prosecutor, Tang Ruxiu, conducted several clear investigations and filed a public prosecution yesterday. A public trial is expected soon. Xi Ehan, believing his daughter is ungrateful and should lose her inheritance rights, requested the court to record the matter, but the court rejected the request, stating that if Xi Yunqing has any actions that result in the loss of inheritance rights, he can file a lawsuit to confirm it in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e125">A Murderous Drama Over a One Copper Coin Dispute Inside a Restaurant <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Wei Xunchen, a cloth merchant from Anhui residing at the back street of the Nanshi Artillery Factory, 25 years old, went to the Shengho Restaurant at 116 Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession, run by Yang Baochu from Wuxi, for lunch at noon on the 7th of this month with a friend. After the meal, the total cost of the food was over 600 cash. Wei handed over a double mill and several copper coins to pay the bill. The restaurant's cashier valued the double mill at 520 cash. Wei argued that the exchange rate at the tobacco and paper shops outside was 530 cash, and it should be accepted at the prevailing market rate, and he should not be shortchanged one copper coin. The cashier then ordered Wei to go outside and exchange the money. However, Wei took the double mill outside and did not exchange it, nor did he return to the restaurant to pay the bill. He went forward. The restaurant waiter saw him and caught up with him, stopping Wei and bringing him back to the restaurant. The two sides started arguing. At that time, two of Wei's fellow villagers, Liang Maotou and Li Zhongfu, were also eating at the Shengho Restaurant. Hearing the commotion, they came out to help Wei commit the violence, twisting and beating the waiter. The patrol officer saw this and brought both parties into the police station for investigation. Suddenly, several hooligans from Anhui heard about the matter and rushed to the Shengho Restaurant to make trouble, destroying a large number of bowls, pots, and other items. At that time, Wei Xunchen, also from Anhui, was stabbed by Yang Xipei, a waiter from Wuxi, with a knife, causing him to bleed profusely. For a time, passersby watched a martial drama erupting over a dispute of one copper coin. Xu tried to intervene, and the French police, hearing the news, immediately dispatched a large number of detectives in patrol cars to suppress the situation, disperse the idlers, and arrest the assailants Yang Xipei and the Anhui people Li Shuxin, Li Zhenglun, and Li Yunze, who were fighting at the scene, and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Sun Pengxian conducted a preliminary hearing. The police department's lawyer stated that the police station needed to arrest the criminals to conduct a detailed investigation and requested a postponement. The court approved the request after briefly questioning the defendants and ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody.</p>

Therefore, all private rickshaw pullers should quickly go to the licensing office on Shunde Road (Xinzha District) to donate and obtain a new license. The license fee is fifty cents this year, and one dollar after this year.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Electrical Expert Sun Qi Invents the "Electric Hot Water Bottle" <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>As winter approaches, the old-fashioned practice of using foot stoves to warm bedding is inherently dangerous. Even the more modern hot water bottles have the inconvenience of frequent water filling and emptying, as well as the potential for leaks and repairs. Recently, electrical expert Mr. Sun Qi, based on his years of research, has invented an "electric hot water bottle." Each night, after a single five-minute electrical charge, it can keep the bed warm all night. The procedure is simple, clean, and safe. The style is attractive, the cost is low, and in addition to providing warmth, it can also be used as an iron. It is truly an extremely economical household item. Mr. Sun is currently applying for a patent and is seeking cooperation with electrical appliance manufacturers to enable mass production and sales. Mr. Sun works in the capital. If electrical appliance manufacturers wish to inquire, they can contact Sun Zhenqiu at the Jiufeng Flour Mill at the Railway Bridge, Xiaguan, Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Young Men Hire Car, Leaving Behind Cloth Banner and Handguns - Suspicious Actions of Three Men, Secrecy Surrounding Banner Slogans <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a taxi company, Xinghua, located at 5 Dongyouheng Road, reported that three passengers had hired a car and, upon completion of the ride, left a rolled-up cloth banner and a square paper box containing two handguns in the car. The incident was discovered by the taxi driver, who reported it to the accounting office, which then reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. A strict investigation is currently underway. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Young Men Hire Car</p>
<p>The Xinghua Taxi Company, located at 5 Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, has been operating for years. At 9:15 yesterday morning, a well-dressed young man, claiming to be surnamed Song and around 30 years old, approached the company's accounting office and stated that he needed to hire a car to go to the French Concession and the Bund to pick up relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Stopped at Alley Entrance</p>
<p>The company's accounting office immediately completed the rental form and handed it to the on-duty taxi driver, Xu Guilin, who drove a taxi with license plate number Zujie 17694 (Huajie 4465). The customer calmly boarded the car, and the taxi sped towards the French Concession. When the car reached the intersection of Fuli Road and Fukaissen Road, the customer ordered the driver to stop the car near an alley entrance.</p>
<p>Cloth Banner and Gift Present</p>
<p>As soon as the car stopped, two men were already waiting at the alley entrance. One of them held a rolled-up cloth banner, and the other carried a square paper box, about a foot in size, resembling a gold-lettered gift present. The two men successively boarded the car, and the three men sat side by side. They then ordered the driver to drive the car to the intersection of Wuma Road and Sichuan Road. Upon reaching the intersection, the two men who had boarded the car later got out empty-handed, leaving the cloth banner and paper box inside the car.</p>
<p>Entered Customs House</p>
<p>At this time, only the young man who had hired the car remained inside. After the two men got out, the young man ordered the driver to drive the car to the Bund, outside the customs house. The driver obeyed and drove. Soon, the car arrived at the back entrance of the customs house on the Bund and stopped. After getting out of the car, the young man hastily took out two yuan from his pocket and paid the driver, and then hurriedly walked into the back entrance of the customs house. The driver immediately drove the empty car back to the company.</p>
<p>Heavy Square Box</p>
<p>When taxi driver Xu Guilin returned to the company, he happened to glance back and suddenly discovered a rolled-up banner and a paper box, realizing that they had been left behind by the two passengers who boarded the car later. Thinking that the customers had forgotten them due to an urgent matter, he intended to take them to the accounting office for safekeeping, waiting for the customers to claim them. However, as soon as he picked up the square box, he felt that it was quite heavy. So he handed the banner and box to the accounting office together.</p>
<p>Two Handguns</p>
<p>The accounting office took the banner and box, and according to routine, had to check the contents of the box to avoid errors. When the paper cover was opened, two live handguns were clearly revealed. At that time, the company staff all expressed shock, and for the sake of caution, they immediately reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate.</p>
<p>Police Secret Investigation</p>
<p>The police first questioned taxi driver Xu Guilin in detail, and then took Xu to the taxi stand and the places where the two passengers boarded and alighted, where Xu gave separate accounts of the situation at that time. Finally, they went to the customs house and inquired extensively, but there was no trace of the young man who had hired the car. However, the fact that the three men had secretly transported two handguns to that place raised suspicions about their intentions. The police are currently conducting a strict investigation. As for the type of slogans written on the abandoned rolled-up banner, the police are keeping it a secret and it is not convenient to disclose.</p>

<p>Shen Shi News Agency in this city reports that the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, in order to comply with our country's new currency system policy, issued a notice warning Japanese and Korean residents that smuggling silver out of the country is prohibited. Violators will be severely punished. At the same time, the Japanese Police Department ordered all police officers to strictly enforce the ban. Yesterday (9th) morning at 9:00 AM, the Japanese Police Department learned that several Japanese nationals were smuggling silver and were taking the Nagasaki Maru out of the country. They immediately dispatched police to board the ship and search. They arrested nine Japanese nationals, including Gin-ya, for smuggling and found more than 2,900 yuan in silver. The criminals were then taken to the Japanese Police Department for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Arrest of Person Mixing Old Silver Dollars in Central Bank - Guangdong Elderly Woman Exchanging Old Silver for Legal Tender - Wang Wanchun Impersonates Bank Employee to Accept Exchange <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>-Suspect Discovered and Arrested by Central Bank-</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order prohibiting the use of old silver dollars, the Central Bank in this city established a special office to collect old silver and exchange it for legal tender. Recently, the bank has been experiencing incidents of people mixing in to exchange old silver, so they have been paying close attention. At 11:00 AM on the 7th of this month, Ms. Li Ye, an elderly woman from Guangdong, brought twenty old silver dollars to the bank's exchange office to exchange for legal tender. Wang Wanchun, a Jiangbei native who lives at 33 Huazhen Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, and makes a living by renting out rickshaws, stepped forward and claimed to be an employee of the Central Bank. He said that he could exchange the silver dollars for her, and it would be the same, and he could exchange them immediately. Ms. Li believed him and handed him the silver dollars. Wang then gave her twenty yuan in banknotes. This was seen by Xia Erchang, an employee of the bank, who reported it to Lin Shiliang, the director of the administration department. Sun Jishen, a Chinese detective, and Chinese constable number 3389 arrived and arrested Wang and took him into custody at the General Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated the facts, saying that the defendant was strongly suspected of committing a crime and that the police were conducting a thorough investigation. Therefore, he requested permission for detention. Ms. Li Ye then testified that the defendant exchanged the money with her at the time, and she handed him the silver dollars, and he gave her banknotes, but she was afraid that they were counterfeit, so she returned them. At this time, the bank employee arrested the defendant. When questioned, the defendant denied the facts and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court, approved the detention of Wang Wanchun for one week for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Emergency Meeting of Rickshaw Guild and Penalized Rickshaw Owners <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>360 Licenses Confiscated This Month - Joint Request to Taxpayers Association to Negotiate with Public Works Department</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Special District Rickshaw Owners Guild, due to the Rickshaw Committee's abuse of power in confiscating licenses and imposing arbitrary fines, convened an emergency meeting of penalized rickshaw owners yesterday morning. More than 50 people attended, chaired by Jin Chunlin. He reported that 136 licenses had been confiscated in November, and 360 licenses have been confiscated this month. Each license carries a fine of ten yuan. Although representatives have been sent to negotiate, there has been no concrete solution. After discussion, it was resolved that: (1) If the Rickshaw Committee does not provide a satisfactory response by the 10th of this month, another meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on the 11th to discuss measures to sanction Zhu Maocheng for abusing his authority and arbitrarily punishing rickshaw owners. (2) All penalized rickshaw owners will jointly write to the Taxpayers Association, requesting them to negotiate with the Public Works Department. (3) Refuse to accept the unreasonable penalties of the Rickshaw Committee (because rickshaw owners only collect four small silver coins and eight copper coins per shift, which complies with the regulations of collecting eight jiao and five fen of silver dollars per day and does not overcharge rent). The Guild also presented a document to the Taxpayers Association stating: The petition is regarding the abuse of power and the daily occurrence of license confiscation and fines, requesting assistance to stop the oppression. Our Guild's rickshaw owners in the Special District, since the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Committee proposed rent reductions last spring, after much debate by the rickshaw owners, the Public Works Department convened an equal meeting between rickshaw owner representatives and the Rickshaw Committee on August 6 of the same year. As a result of the discussions, it was agreed that the total rent, including the driver's mutual aid fund fee, should be eight jiao and five fen of silver dollars per day. Later, because the rickshaw pullers did not have silver dollars to pay the rent, both parties reconsidered and changed to twelve jiao of small silver coins. The facts are available for verification. Until November of this year, when the new currency system was implemented, the Rickshaw Committee published a notice on the 9th of the same month, also sending a letter to our Guild's Special District office, stating that the rent collected should not exceed eight jiao and five fen of silver dollars, and that if it is small silver coins, each shift can only collect five jiao and three copper coins, and two shifts a day should only collect ten jiao and six copper coins. Our office immediately forwarded the letter to all rickshaw owners and asked them to inform the licensees to comply. Unexpectedly, before the letter was even disseminated, the Rickshaw Committee, based on the inaccurate reports of rickshaw pullers, believed that the rickshaw owners were overcharging rent and abusing their powers, and began confiscating licenses and imposing fines on a daily basis. For example, a fine of ten yuan is required for one confiscated license, and a fine of one hundred yuan is required for ten confiscated licenses, and so on. If the fines are not paid, the licenses will be confiscated. The misunderstandings in the penalties imposed within a month are numerous. To briefly explain, the rickshaws are rented out in two shifts, morning and evening. However, the operating hours are different for each rickshaw line. If the morning and evening shifts are equal, the rent will naturally be the same. If the morning shift is short and the evening shift is long, the rent will naturally vary. The current misunderstanding is that the morning shift collects four jiao and six fen of small silver coins, and the evening shift collects six jiao of small silver coins. The Rickshaw Committee only listens to the evening shift drivers and does not investigate the morning shift rental price, which is the first reason. In addition, the Rickshaw Committee allows rickshaw owners or licensees to collect rickshaw pullers' loans, unpaid rent, and housing fees, according to the document exchanged on November 30 of last year. The reason for this misunderstanding is that many rickshaw owners or licensees collected the above-mentioned items, which caused dissatisfaction among the rickshaw pullers, who reported the matter summarily. The Rickshaw Committee did not distinguish or assess the situation and simply ruled that the rent had been overcharged, which is the second reason. Although the rickshaw owners explained and debated repeatedly, the Rickshaw Committee ignored them and said that those who applied for reconsideration would be doubly punished if summoned a second time, regardless of whether the charges were true or not. There were also cases where, if summoned during a period of time and were unable to attend due to circumstances, they would be doubly punished once summoned. "For example, if the original fine was ten yuan per vehicle, the rickshaw owner would have to pay two hundred yuan if the rickshaw owner has the above two situations." Not only are the penalties unwarranted, but they are also aggravated. The Western and Chinese members of the committee, such as Gao Bi, wield their power and their words are law, leaving little room for discussion, which is alarming. The rickshaw owners, oppressed and devastated by this, have come to the Guild to report the situation, full of indignation and anger, with tears in their eyes. Previously, our office sent a letter to the Rickshaw Committee, requesting it to carefully consider the situation and handle it with leniency. The rickshaw owners should correct their faults if they have any, and encourage themselves if they don't have any. After the letter was sent, the committee replied that it would still act arbitrarily and not adopt the suggestions. On December 2, the committee convened a general meeting of all rickshaw owners in the Special District and publicly elected representatives such as Yin Zhiling and Hou Shaoan to negotiate. As a result, the committee said that whether or not to implement the penalties would be decided by the Board of Directors on the 10th of this month. The representatives thought that there was a possibility of change, but since then, the number of rickshaw owners summoned for penalties has increased day by day, which is even more shocking. We believe that every rickshaw owner in the Special District is aware of the situation. Under the pressure of being repeatedly fined, they would still dare to overcharge a small amount of rent, risking large fines or the confiscation of their licenses for a month. Even foolish rickshaw owners would not be so foolish. The reason is that the rickshaw pullers and rickshaw owners inevitably have grievances at times. Now, because the Rickshaw Committee suppresses the rickshaw owners and favors the rickshaw pullers, they will summon and punish them regardless of the truth. Therefore, the rickshaw pullers dare to take this opportunity to retaliate, which is why the number of cases is increasing. (It has been found that more than 50 rickshaw owners and licensees have been fined and had their licenses confiscated, involving about 500 rickshaws. A separate form is attached.) If this continues, the impact will be great, and disputes will be numerous. The public rickshaw industry is on the verge of bankruptcy. Your Guild is the only legal organization of Chinese taxpayers, dedicated to promoting the welfare of citizens and supporting various industries, which is universally admired. Therefore, we are submitting this request, hoping that you will consider the situation, speak out for justice, and forward this letter to the Public Works Department, requesting them to stop the Rickshaw Committee from abusing its powers and to exempt all the fines and confiscations, so that the rickshaw owners will not suffer endless losses and the escalating disputes can be resolved. Our industry will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate. We are anxiously awaiting your response.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Municipal Rent Reduction Committee Writes to the Real Estate Association Urging Prompt and Voluntary Rent Reductions <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Relieve the Burden on Tenants - Prosper the Whole Society</p>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee believes that the rent reduction issue has been repeatedly requested from the authorities to set a standard, but for various reasons, it has not been promulgated. As the end of the year approaches, various industries are becoming more difficult. In order to maintain social stability, the committee sent another letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, requesting them to forward the letter to all property owners, urging them to quickly abandon their prejudices and voluntarily reduce rents in order to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. The original letter stated: "We are writing to you regarding the rent reduction dispute. Because the property owners stubbornly cling to their prejudices, the issue has not been resolved. The market is currently sluggish, and commerce is declining. The number of businesses forced to close is increasing daily. The reason for this is that rent expenses account for 50-60% of daily expenses. Therefore, the once-prosperous Shanghai is now lined with empty houses, with no one asking about them, and the unemployed population is increasing daily. They lack the means to make a living, and some even resort to crime, which has a significant impact on social stability. We believe that tenants and property owners are in the same boat and should understand each other to get through the current difficulties. If they stubbornly cling to their prejudices and refuse to reduce rents, leading to lawsuits in court, both sides will suffer losses and create unfortunate disputes. Our committee is horrified by the prospects. For the sake of the interests of both parties and the sake of social stability, we are writing to your association again, requesting that you follow the rent reduction plan formulated by our committee, consider the actual situation, and uniformly reduce rents in order to maintain each other's goodwill and make a plan for coexistence and co-prosperity. It is a last resort, and we hope you will understand. As for the disputes that have already occurred, our committee will send personnel to mediate. In addition, please announce a voluntary rent reduction for the houses that have not yet reduced rents. It is related to the whole society, and we hope you will adopt our suggestion. We will be very grateful for your cooperation."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers will hold its regular meeting and dinner at the Bankers Association at 4 Hong Kong Road in this city at 7:00 PM today. Members will pay a meal fee of one yuan and five jiao of national currency per person. Lu Zhixue will also be giving a speech on China's soap industry. Mr. Lu is a senior figure in the industrial sector who studied in the UK. He has managed factories and mines and has extensive knowledge and experience. He recently took charge of the Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Company and also serves as the Managing Director of the Wu Zhou Dispensary. Recently, he has visited and investigated various countries in Europe, America, and Japan, sparing no effort. He is particularly enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods. It is said that he will have very good material to present at the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Business Printing Press to Implement Acceptance Drafts Starting Today <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Business Printing Press of this city is the largest cultural organization in the country. It deals with no fewer than four hundred factories and businesses on a daily basis for printing and manufacturing, as well as procuring raw materials. For the convenience of clients in collecting accounts, it is stipulated that payments be made on the 15th and 31st of each month. The press also notifies clients of the amounts due in advance by postcard, allowing them to pay on time. Therefore, clients invariably consider it convenient. However, in recent years, various industries have been sluggish, and financing has been extremely tight. The press, in order to further assist its partner factories and businesses with capital turnover, has decided to adopt commercial acceptance drafts starting today. The following are the press's provisional measures: for any delivery worth more than 100 national currency units, the client may issue an application to have half of the amount accepted in advance, while the remaining half will be paid in accordance with the original payment method. As for clients who wish to cash or discount the drafts at a bank, they are generally required to provide a guarantor. However, this procedure presents difficulties for small factories. Therefore, the press has specifically consulted with the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China, the Jiangxi Road branch of the Jin Cheng Bank, and the Ningbo Road branch of the Shanghai Bank. Small factories with no prior dealings with banks may, with the press's prior approval, deposit their seals with the aforementioned banks, so that they can cash or discount the drafts based on the seals and interest rates. The aforementioned three banks, in order to support domestic industry and commerce, have also generally agreed to provide special preferential treatment. Due to the various conveniences mentioned above, partner factories and shops have been enthusiastically contacting the press to adopt this system. It is said that the press will have to increase its procedural workload by one-third in order to automatically adopt acceptance drafts in addition to the original payment method, but for the sake of facilitating the turnover of funds for its clients, it is still determined to implement the system.</p>

<p>The Four-Corner Number Indexing Method invented by Mr. Wang Yunwu can be mastered by scholars in two hours. Each character can be found in an average of only 8.9 seconds. It is easy to learn and easy to use, breaking the records of other indexing methods. Many party and government agencies, academic organizations, libraries, and schools in China have adopted it. The newly compiled telephone directory of the Shanghai Telephone Company already includes a Four-Corner Number Index. The telephone directories of the Shanghai and Nanjing Telephone Bureaus of the Ministry of Communications for the 25th year of the Republic of China have also decided to add a Four-Corner Number Indexing Table. American libraries and Japanese publications have also occasionally adopted this method. The "Wang Yunwu Great Dictionary," "Wang Yunwu Concise Dictionary," and "Wang Yunwu Concise Wordbook" published by the Commercial Press are all arranged according to the Four-Corner Number Method. Many other dictionaries, encyclopedias, and large books also include Four-Corner Number Indexes. Scholars can find what they need quickly and easily when consulting these books. Recently, the call for eliminating illiteracy has grown louder, and educational administrative agencies in various places have spared no effort in promoting compulsory education. The various dictionaries and wordbooks published by the Commercial Press, arranged according to the Four-Corner Number Method, are indeed the only useful tools for literacy campaigns. It is reported that the press recently received a letter from the Suiyuan News Agency stating that the Provincial Compulsory Education Committee plans to purchase 30,000 copies of the "Wang Yunwu Concise Wordbook" from the press when implementing the second phase of short-term education.</p>

<p>Criminal Suit That Cannot Be Withdrawn Concluded by the Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Tibetan Lama Song Kanbu of the Sera Monastery came to Nanjing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. After the meeting ended on the 30th of last month, he came to Shanghai and stayed in Room 257 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road. He then discovered that all the cash and silver dollars totaling 300 yuan and 13 taels of saffron in his suitcase had disappeared. Suspecting that the hotel was involved in the theft, he filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. The hotel responded through its accountant, Yao Yunfang, who filed counterclaims of false accusation and defamation. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo continued the hearing in Criminal Court No. 9. The case has now been mediated by Jiang Ganting, president of the World Red Swastika Society. Because Song's travel expenses had been completely stolen, preventing him from returning to Tibet, Jiang persuaded the Andong Hotel to subsidize him with 100 silver dollars and the Red Swastika Society to subsidize him with 150 silver dollars to cover his travel expenses. This mediation plan was accepted by both parties, so the private suit was settled and withdrawn by Song. As for Andong's counterclaim of defamation, it was subject to prosecution and was also withdrawn. The remaining original suit and counterclaim of false accusation could not be withdrawn according to law, and Judge Dai proceeded with the trial. He summoned the hotel's tea server, receptionist, and others to court for detailed questioning. Then, he ordered the start of the debate, with the plaintiff's lawyer, Dong Yu, and the defendant's lawyer, Wang Chuanbi, arguing back and forth. Judge Dai then announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<p>Jing Riru and Zhou Wenkui, two employees of the Aiduya Road branch of the Bank of Communications, previously spread rumors to their friend Sun Shiyu, claiming that the Continental Bank was experiencing instability. They instructed Sun to deposit 10,000 yuan with their bank as collateral. Sun believed them and asked them to handle the matter. Jing and Zhou then used the collateral to deposit 9,000 yuan with the Continental Bank and then deposited the money into the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China. They then withdrew the money in Sun's name. When Sun discovered this, he reported it to the General Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng arrested Jing Riru, while Zhou fled. Jing was handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in Criminal Court No. 2. After the police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, and Jing's defense lawyer, Xu Wufang, argued back and forth, Judge Huang announced the verdict: Jing Riru was found guilty of assisting in the fraudulent acquisition of property and was fined 1,000 yuan. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be sentenced to six months of forced labor. He has the right to appeal and was granted a suspension of detention upon posting a 5,000-yuan bail.</p>

<p>Late the night before last, four or five bandits suddenly arrived at the Shunxing Slaughtering Company in Caojiadu, Shanghai. Armed with two Mauser pistols and one handgun, they broke into the company. The bandits drove all the employees into one room and were about to search for money when, fortunately, Tan Baoshou, the director of the Public Security Bureau of the town, along with the leader of the detective squad, Zhuang Dexiu, the deputy leader, Xin Jingsheng, the team leader, Liu Bingyuan, Liu Shaoqing, and other detectives, were patrolling the area.

<p>Chen Meigong of Yun Jian was a great Confucian scholar of the Ming Dynasty. He lamented the changes in the world and lived in seclusion, refusing to serve as an official. His poems and essays were famous throughout the country. During the late Ming Dynasty, there was a trend among men of letters to compete in publishing books. Chen Meigong compiled and authored many books. He once compiled and published Bao Yan Tang Secret Manuscripts, which was a major collection of essays of the Ming Dynasty. His own writings included the Ten Kinds of Chen Meigong Series, of which Authentic Drafts of Bai Shi Qiao is one. The entire book contains 24 volumes, written in a fragrant and lively style, and is a model of essays. There are also 24 volumes of Essays from the Late Fragrance Hall, which were compiled by his disciples. If these are published together, they can be called the Complete Works of Chen Meigong. The fourteenth title in the Rare Chinese Literature Series is carefully collated by A Ying, with a postscript by Shi Zhecun and a cover inscription by Lu Jiye. It is divided into two volumes, containing over 400 pages and over 300,000 words. The retail price for the entire set is only 60 cents, and the special edition is 90 cents. In addition, the thirteenth title, the critical short story Tales Under the Bean Arbor, is a superb work of short fiction from the early Qing Dynasty. Zheng Zhenduo highly praised it in his Essays on Literature. It has now been carefully collated by Dai Wangshu, with a cover inscription by Hu Shi. The retail price has been drastically reduced to make it widely accessible, with the regular edition priced at only 20 cents and the special edition at only 25 cents. The poetry and essay collection of Yuan Bosiu, the founder of the Gong'an School of the Ming Dynasty, was published last week. The collection, White Su Zhai, was compiled by his younger brothers, Yuan Zhonglang and Yuan Xiaoxiu, and is superior to any other edition. To understand the origins of the New Literature Movement, one must trace it back to Gong'an and Jingling. Those who wish to study the writings of the Gong'an School cannot afford to overlook this collection of Yuan Bosiu's essays. There are two types of retail prices: 40 cents and 50 cents. The entire collection of 50 titles in the Rare Book Series can be pre-ordered for a total of 17 yuan, which is only equivalent to the price of one woodblock-printed book.

<p>"I don't want to sleep. You said my boots are bad and I always slip," Robb was about to cry out loud, but he restrained himself with effort. Then he said, "If the mosquitoes (note) didn't bite me so much, I could sleep well and wait for Mama to come." This kind of pleading patience deeply touched Nan En's heart.</p>
<p>"Put your head on my lap, and I will cover you with my skirt; I am not afraid of the dark," Nan En said, sitting alone, trying to convince herself that she did not care about all the shadows and the strange sounds around her.</p>
<p>"Wake me up when she comes," Robb said, and in less than five minutes he had buried his head under Nan En's apron and was fast asleep.</p>
<p>The little girl sat alone for another quarter of an hour, looking around her anxiously, feeling that every second was like an hour. Suddenly, a faint white light shone from the top of the mountain, and she said to herself:</p>
<p>"I think the night is over, and morning is coming. I like to watch the sunrise, so I will wait for it. After the sun comes out, we can find our way home."</p>

<p>Xie Xing wins Shanghai University (A) Xie Xing has been impressive since defeating McLean. The players are tall and outstanding, and they are indeed an excellent team among Chinese teams. Shanghai University's strength is not what it used to be, but the young people are strong and brave, and everyone has lively and beautiful skills. They are unwilling to show weakness and try their best to resist Xie Xing, opening up a very touching situation and achieving a glorious record. Although unfortunately defeated, it was also a glorious defeat. Center Huang Lifu must have obtained the highest scoring record in every battle. He is indeed a new hero in the Shanghai basketball world this year.</p>
<p>At the beginning, in a stalemate, Huang Li opened the record, and Zhang Mianxiang immediately returned the number. Since then, they have insisted that there is no achievement for a long time. Xie Xing suddenly succeeded. Qiu Guangxie relied on his volleyball jumping skills and scored three goals in a row in front of the basket. Li Lianze added icing on the cake, leading with 12-2 from afar.</p>
<p>Shanghai University is enterprising, arrogant, and breaks through Xie Xing's barriers. Huang Lifu and Zhou Bao have repeatedly made great achievements. Huang Liqiang and Dai Dingguo are strictly guarded and the lineup is tight. They are full of life. Soon, they took the lead with 15-14. Zhu Peisheng added three points, boasting for a while with 18-14.</p>
<p>After Xie Xing Zhou Dayun chased two points, the situation still did not improve, so Chen Zongqi was transferred to Weng Renan, trying to counterattack, but Shanghai University's momentum was strong and invincible. Xie Xing has always been in the oppressed and harsh environment. Dai Dingguo created 22-16, and Zhou Dayun and Zhang Jinxiang attacked, and in an extremely enthusiastic situation, Li Lianze created a 22-22 tie. In a blink of an eye, Zhu Peisheng of Shanghai University scored again in one minute, and the first half ended. Shanghai University 26 points, Xie Xing 24 points.</p>
<p>The situation in the second half was even more tense. Xie Xing Zhou Zhang promoted the equal number of 29. The heroic spirit of Shanghai University still did not weaken. Once again, it took the lead with 36-31, and the two gentlemen of Dai Huang were blessed and shot wonderfully, and it became 40-33, which was extremely prosperous for a while.</p>
<p>But since then, Xie Xing's momentum suddenly shook. Zhou Dayun launched a series of shots and repeatedly hit, and it became 40-40 again. Xie Xing transferred Shen Zongjiao to replace Li Lianze. This person is fat and runs clumsily like a goose. But people should not be judged by their appearance, and everyone has their own destiny. The shooting is excellent, and it must be thrown. Xie Xing relied on his Zongjiao divine power, and the situation was indeed new. Since then, it has been smooth sailing and invincible. Finally, with 52-45, he maintained his usual victory and glory.</p>

<p>Although the gold market stabilized yesterday due to the increase in the standard gold price, there was no shortage of supply to take advantage of the high price. Large bars were also sold slightly. After people's hearts stabilized, it gradually became tired. A large number of floating shorts emerged, once approaching the 40 yuan mark.

Although it struggled slightly due to the two shrinkages of two annas in Mumbai in the middle, the spot firms continued to post, and the swap spread still needed eight yuan. The congestion of the spot market has not yet eased, causing panic that this swap will be unfavorable to the long side, and the sellers are more fierce, so the long side collapsed and fell sharply, almost approaching the 40 yuan mark.

<p>Yesterday, the market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange improved due to hopes for a resolution to the North China Incident, and market confidence improved slightly. The market had previously been excessively long, and as market prices rose slightly, they immediately fell back, as the bulls were taking advantage of the opportunity to cash in. Therefore, the market conditions in the early session still had one or two struggles. Yesterday, three sessions were conducted. At the opening, there were sales at 11, 21, 32, 33, and 43, and slight purchases at 48 and 54. Although market prices rose by 1 to 2 jiao to 8.5 jiao, the positive six and negative small 2 to 3 jiao were due to sales at 4, leading to a decline in market confidence. In the second session, most transactions turned small, with only slight differences. There were sales at 4 and 48, with a loss of 0.6 jiao in the 20 series being the most. In the afternoon session, there were sales at 4, 21, and 78, with only slight offsetting purchases at 11 and 54. Market prices were initially firm but then declined, so the later listings were down by small 2 to 3 jiao. The future is not easily optimistic. The market price results showed small declines of 2 to 3 jiao for the last two or three items, while the previous listings mostly rose by 2 to 7 jiao. The total transaction volume was 22,254,500 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: silver yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market was flat and weak. Initially, it was firm due to the peaceful resolution of the North China situation, but generally, there was selling on rallies, so the current pressure is still heavy. However, the financial community and the gold traders have not released the funds they have dragged in, resulting in fierce competition between the bulls and bears. Currently, yarn sales are gradually showing signs of life in the north, and the Tianjin area is developing, purchasing 1,200 bales, and the market is trending higher.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Futures Market Sales Rise</p>
<p>The opening price of the spot yarn market was uniformly high for all months. Due to the peaceful situation in the north and slightly improved market confidence, it was nearly flat. Far-month contracts rose by 1.4-1.5 yuan. However, some shorts took advantage of the rise to sell and increase their positions, and bulls such as Taifoo, Hoksing, and Taichangcheng also cashed in, causing the market to loosen. By the second and third sessions, it suddenly fell, and the downward trend was quite strong. As a result, all months fell compared to the previous day's closing price by 0.4-0.5-0.7 yuan, except for this month, which only fell slightly by 0.1 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a major change in the situation. Selling pressure permeated, and market prices were quite weak. All months uniformly fell, plunging by over 1 yuan. In the second session, it continued to decline, but Changfeng took advantage of the low prices to heavily cover shorts. The third session tightened, and by the time of closing, it was heard that Tianjin traders were developing their purchases of spot yarn, and market conditions were particularly firm. As a result, all months fell compared to the morning closing price, with near months down 0.2-0.7-0.5 yuan and far months down 0.9 yuan. Sales were Taifoo 1,200 bales, Hoksing 1,350 bales, Shunchi 900 bales, Taichangcheng 2,050 bales, Changfeng 1,400 bales, Yuntai 1,050 bales, Taifung 900 bales, Shunchang 1,400 bales, Yunkang 1,150 bales, and Tahchi 800 bales.

<p>Spot Yarn Sales Brisk in North China</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were quite brisk. According to statistics, various traders bought a total of 2,027 bales for the day. Prices rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan, and thread rose by 2 yuan. The purchase amounts for each trader are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose. The morning situation was still firm, as the Japanese trader Toyo Cotton continued to buy on dips, so the market trended higher. However, there was also intention to sell short, so the competition between the two sides was extremely fierce. Recently, the overseas cotton market has been in a state of fluctuation, and export transactions are scarce.</p>

<p>The opening of the spot cotton market saw all months trending upward, due to the good yarn market. However, when it came to the far months, Shincheng and foreign traders sold out, and market prices suddenly loosened. The second session saw a major drop, but the financial community and the gold traders' bulls remained unmoved. However, general cotton merchants, believing that prices were already high, had a strong intention to sell short. As a result, all months fell compared to the previous day's closing price by 0.15 to 0.35 to 0.4 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a very weak situation, with selling pressure very strong. Yudah, Hayu, and Yuansingchang and other shorts came to increase their positions, each falling by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. However, by the time of the second and third sessions, Shincheng came to heavily cover shorts again, and market prices turned from weak to firm. It was also heard that the Japanese trader Toyo Cotton was still buying and selling. By the time of closing, the far months had risen above the morning closing price. As a result, the near months fell by 0.05 yuan, and the far months rose by 0.15 yuan. Sales were Hayu 3,300 dan, Yuhtah 1,600 dan, Tahchi 1,300 dan, Taifoo 3,100 dan, Tungfoo 2,500 dan, Yudah 5,700 dan, Taichangcheng 2,500 dan, Shincheng 3,200 dan, Changwoo 3,500 dan, Changyu 3,100 dan, Yunkang 3,700 dan, and Yuansingchang 3,200 dan.

<p>Tianjin correspondence: Yarn prices have risen sharply. Traders are actively demanding. In addition, prices in Shanghai and Qingdao are soaring, so both buyers and sellers have high morale.

<p>Last week's market conditions did not show any strength. After the release of the US cotton field plan, US cotton rose. Here, due to sluggish transportation and increased movement, it fell due to pressure from sellers. Apart from a slight export demand, there was little outside news. In terms of spot goods, Japan may have demand in the near future, but otherwise there is no expansion. Domestic receipts are increasing daily. Farmers, seeing a slight drop in market prices, are engaging in hoarding. Generally speaking, the trend is slightly soft.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, initially was flat, then strengthened in all months. Imported wheat prices were reported to be slightly lower in Chicago by 0.08, and better in the far months by 0.1-0.2 jiao, and better in Canada by 0.1 jiao. The initial market was uniformly seen as flat, and profit-taking bulls continued to sell out, so the market atmosphere was similar to the previous day. However, by the second session and later, as shorts did not add chips, and rumors of borrowing wheat had not yet been confirmed, market confidence gradually waned, and buying interest revived. All months immediately improved by 0.01-0.02 jiao. By the time of the afternoon opening, as non-industry bulls came to absorb again, near and far terms continued to improve by 0.02-0.03 jiao. The second session's momentum was still strong, and far terms improved by another 0.01 jiao. However, after the third session, as retail traders tended to sell out, it returned to a stable state. In the future, the situation will depend on whether imported wheat continues to stabilize or not, which will be the turning point for ups and downs.</p>

<p>—Wheat Still Lacks Excitement—</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market in each session saw mixed fortunes. As imported wheat prices recovered only slightly, and Liverpool continued to fall, trading in all months was very quiet when the market opened, remaining in a spin. Only April showed a unique weakness, falling by 0.03 yuan, while the rest were better by 0.02-0.03 yuan. By the time of the afternoon opening, trading in all months was comparatively lively, but the market atmosphere lacked any great vitality. Since the end of the year is approaching and accounts are being settled, both industry and non-industry traders are uniformly closing positions. Moreover, imported wheat trends are also uncertain, so although the situation appeared slightly better, it lacked excitement. Spot wheat market sees relatively active delivery, and prices show no upward or downward movement. Kaiyingzhou Huaian wheat is 4.85 yuan, Jiangbei wheat is 4.80 yuan, Shaoxing wheat is 4.65 yuan, and Hankow wheat is 4.63 yuan, secondary is 4.55 yuan. Fuxin issued 2,000 yuan, and Xinda went to 2,500 yuan.</p>

<p>—River Bottom Rice Is Downstream All the Way—</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for each trader became scarce, with only about twenty arrivals (a total of 4,500-4,600 piculs). The packaging route has become weak, with only about 2,000 packages being sold. Retail sales are sluggish, so the price of thin rice has fallen another 0.1 jiao. The price of thick粳rice and early rice has stabilized due to scarce arrivals. The price of cloudy rice has also been sluggish by a small amount.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for each route in the river bottom was quite strong, with about 50-60 arrivals. Retail sales of white-tipped rice on the market were weak, and national traders took advantage of the situation to pick up rice, with prices weakening by a small fraction to almost 0.1 jiao. Early rice was scarce, and sales were still acceptable, with prices stable. Retail sales of thin rice were normal, with prices down slightly. White silver wine traders were tied up, and store traders were quite active, with prices stable. The prices of Yangpu tip and Tu Ke tip were unchanged. The rest of the goods were similar to before.</p>
<p>Yesterday, passenger profits increased more. Particularly, Ganzhou, Anhui, Shashi, Ying, Wenzhou, Taiwan, and Fujian were plentiful. There are still huge amounts of goods in transit from each port that will arrive soon. The market was originally soft, but North Ocean traders are only handling and shipping river bottom rice. Passenger xian has not yet been considered. Hoarders have also withdrawn. However, now that the situation is gradually stabilizing, North Sea traders may have hope for continued handling. Local sales suddenly became lively yesterday, and there was a snow-like appearance. The amount of goods arriving from various places may decrease in the future, and the need may increase. Therefore, the market is turning upward. All rice types have transferred stations. If sales become more lively again today and tomorrow, then the market may have hope for an upward expansion. Yesterday, 2,500 packages of Gan rice were opened, 900 packages of Shashi rice, 262 packages of Hankow rice, 454 packages of Anhui rice, 2,340 packages of Zhejiang rice, and 550 packages of Fujian rice. In addition, there were also distributions by trading firms, which were all handled locally.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the British trader Jardine Matheson was still very interested in needle and eyebrow green teas from Wuyuan and Tunxi, and a total of over 800 cases were traded in the city. The opening market price was 14.5 yuan, 1-2 yuan lower than before. Precious eyebrow and tribute eyebrow items saw market conditions trending toward sluggishness. Currently, the inventory of red and green tea on the market is only over 8,000 cases. The quality of good products is also exhausted. The tea market is showing a declining scene.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Oil Market: Soybean Oil Has Kerosene Flavor <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Soybean Oil Is Likely to Rise, Not Fall, During the River Closure Period</p>
<p>The soybean oil market is in a situation of only rising and not falling. The rivers in the northeast are severely frozen, and the soybean oil mills in Niuzhuang, Shahe, and other places have stopped work and transportation as usual. Currently, the only source of goods is Dalian. Therefore, during this river closure period, there is little chance of falling prices. Yesterday, Niuzhuang oil shipped by steamer opened at 20.085 yuan, Shahe Qishan oil shipped by steamer opened at 20.00 yuan, Qishan oil shipped by sand boat opened at 19.90 yuan, Qingqi oil opened at 19.05 yuan, and soybean oil from this factory opened at 20.025 yuan. Currently, the city's inventory, excluding Dalian oil and factory oil, is approximately 1,000 large baskets and 2,000 small baskets. Recently, a dispute has occurred in the market regarding Dalian oil containing kerosene. It is recalled that the same thing happened two years ago, and it was settled after a Dalian representative came to Shanghai for verification. This time the problem has arisen again. The outcome will depend on how the industry deals with it.</p>
<h3 id="e184">White Tung Oil Rises and Falls <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The foreign trader's route for white tung oil is endless. Half a month ago, spot goods were very short, and the Hankow market price once rose to 57 yuan per dan. Subsequently, cheap sales opened in Wanxian, Sichuan Province, and Changde, Hunan Province, and the Hankow market gradually loosened and fell. At the beginning of this month, it was still selling for 53.5 yuan, then 52.8 yuan, then 52 yuan. Yesterday, this port received a Hankow telegram stating that foreign traders had opened at 50 yuan. The previous rise was indeed caused by squeezing spot goods, so spot oil will be seen as relieved. It is falling back again. However, its rise and fall have had a significant impact on Zhejiang tung. At that time, Zhejiang tung once rose from 45-46 yuan to 52 yuan. Recently, it has fallen back to 46-47 yuan. However, since the foreign traders in Hankow have fallen to 50 yuan, it is possible that it will stabilize. Export goods are calculated in gold pounds. Since the shortening of the shilling, the current 50 yuan is equivalent to 40 yuan before our country's currency system was changed. After this, there will naturally be hope for the development of foreign trade. Moreover, tung oil exports are in a booming era, and they are flourishing.</p>

<p>Sichuan preserved vegetable roots [zha cai] have recently seen limited sourcing due to high land prices making it difficult to be cost-effective. Consequently, the market price in Shanghai has increased by two or three yuan. Some suppliers have even quoted seventeen or eighteen yuan. However, as some traders and businesses had previously purchased at lower prices, they are now selling off their stock for profit, alleviating any concerns about shortages.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Textiles: French Serge Lining is Scarce, Price Increases <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>As the weather turns cold, the demand for overcoats has surged, leading to a dramatic increase in sales. However, shipments of French serge lining from foreign firms have ceased, resulting in a supply shortage in the Shanghai market. Both domestic and foreign warehouses have depleted their stock, causing the market to be very active. Based on current exchange rates and customs duties, the cost to import is approximately sixty cents per yard. Those holding inventory are now speculating and raising prices. Yesterday, A277 Old Brand French serge lining was sold at a net wholesale price of 57 cents per yard. Domestic Hongsheng goods were sold for 47 or 48 cents yesterday. Initially sold at 33 cents, Japanese French serge lining has now also experienced a sharp price increase to 42 or 43 cents. Buyers are seeking it everywhere for future use, but it is hard to find, making it a highly sought-after item in the recent woolen goods market.</p>

<p>Three-foot and six-foot large raw leather has become scarce since the military began purchasing it, especially the five-section pattern. Other patterns, from eight to ten sections, are also quite rare. The current market price for three- and four-section leather is eight yuan and twenty-five cents per picul. Five-section leather is out of stock, so the quoted price is nine yuan and fifty cents. Six- and seven-section leather is estimated at eight yuan and fifty cents, while eight- to ten-section leather is estimated at around nine yuan per picul.</p>

<p>— (A Cold Kiss)</p>
<p>Wu Zhilao once said: "The Executive Yuan is like the Earth God Shrine: with it, people still eat and sleep as usual. Without it, people still eat and sleep as usual. So there's no need to be anxious."</p>
<p>When Kang Youwei was dying, he told his two sons: "You should read more books by the ancients, and talk less about current affairs. This will both increase your knowledge and avoid unexpected dangers."</p>
<p>When Tang Shengzhi's National Revolutionary Army attacked Jiangxi from Hubei in 1926, they divided into two wings, one attacking Wuxue, and the other attacking Tianjiazhen. The 8th Army attacked Wuxue, but could not capture it after a long siege. Tang was very anxious, and asked his subordinates: "Why has Wuxue not been captured after so long? Which army is attacking?" The subordinates replied that it was the 8th Army. Tang suddenly realized, saying: "Using the 8th Army to attack Wuxue, since 'xue' [穴] means 'hole', and '8' [八] looks like a hole below, it is naturally difficult to overcome." Later, the 7th Army was reassigned to attack, and the city fell in a few days. This was also a strange event.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Poisons of Abyssinia <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Italian soldiers introduced poison gas into the war to invade Abyssinia, but the Abyssinians themselves also had many potent poisons that could be used in exchange. In terms of function and effectiveness, their poisons were even more dangerous than poison gas. Abyssinian tribal people could extract juice from cacti and other plants to brew a strong poison. They could put this poison in water holes, poisoning enemy soldiers who drank it deep inland.</p>
<p>An Abyssinian chemist living in Addis Ababa (the capital of Abyssinia) knew the most details about deadly shrub poisons. He had recorded various poisons, listing an Abyssinian poison table, which contained many poisons made from plants unfamiliar to people elsewhere. For example, there was a poison called "Enga Bolobi", a powdered substance made from the dry roots of the "Enga Bolobi" shrub. If this poison powder was mixed in tobacco, the smoker would die after taking the second or third puff. The bulbs and fruits of several other plants could provide poisonous juice. If this poisonous juice was mixed into beer or boiled meat, unsuspecting people who ate it would suffer considerably, even losing their lives.</p>
<p>The most terrifying poison was the milky juice obtained from the seven-star candelabra-shaped cactus tree. Soldiers poured this poisonous juice into ponds, and within half an hour, all the fish in the pond floated to the surface, gasping for air. However, one thing that was astonishing and difficult to understand was that soldiers could catch and eat the fish floating on the surface gasping for air without being poisoned at all. The poison in a pond that had been poured with this juice was permanent, showing the toxicity. Once, a local did not know that poisonous juice had been poured into a pond a few days before, and used the water to wash his face while fishing. His companion quickly called him to stop, but it was too late. Water had splashed on his hands, face, neck, and arms. In less than twenty minutes, a large area of small blisters appeared on the skin where the water had splashed. His eyes closed, and his painful expression was frightening. His companion quickly washed him with clear water, but his eyes had already been damaged, and he was blind for more than a week. Therefore, when Italian soldiers crossed the Mareb River and invaded inland, they found that every mile they advanced increased the difficulty of their work.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Incense at the Yang Wang Temple <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>There is a Yang Wang Temple in the northern part of Nanxiang City. It is built very solemnly. Inside is a statue of Yang Wang with a black face, which is very majestic. Every year on the day of the Zhongyuan Festival, boat gangs from all over come to welcome the gods and hold grand celebrations. This can be considered an annual event, which has been passed down for decades. Because Yang Wang has always protected them, giving smooth sailing, they have great faith and respect for him. However, starting this Spring Festival, there has been an unexpected surge in incense offerings at the temple. People from the northern district of Shanghai’s red-light district take the train to burn incense on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, making the Shanghai-Nanxiang train full of noisy chatter. According to them, a certain temple in Shanghai is no longer effective, but Yang Wang in Nanxiang is very effective. Burning incense once will definitely bring a considerable income, so everyone comes to burn incense sincerely.</p>
<p>The cost of burning incense is originally very high, especially for prostitutes! Donating some lamp oil, ten yuan or five yuan is originally nothing rare, as long as they are blessed in the underworld to receive one more big customer, a good fool.</p>
<p>Some people say that Yang Wang has had a stroke of luck this year—those who burn incense are a group of young and beautiful girls. When I heard it, I repeatedly said no...no...no...you are wrong. Do you know why prostitutes want to burn incense at Yang Wang's place? Isn't that god's statue black-faced? This can be understood very clearly, that is, ordinary gigolos are not willing to spend money, so let there be more people like Yang Wang.</p>
<p>Candle shops, prostitutes are also very superstitious. There is a Tianfu, they say that Tian gives blessing, the meaning is very good, so the candle business is very prosperous. There is a Wuchang, it is said that the word Chang is a homonym for the word sore, they are afraid of getting sores, so they are unwilling to buy, hehe, this can also be regarded as fortunate and unfortunate.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Two: Knightly Words Move Rouge Lips, a Group of Sisters Convenes for Discussion; False Affection Startles Jade Wrists, a Suffering Girl Escapes Captivity</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Hu was so frightened that her face turned from red to green, and she forced a smile: "Oh! Sir, we don't know each other, and we have no grievances or hatred. Why are you treating me like this?" Bei Hai said: "If I knew you, I wouldn't let you do such a thing. As for whether there's hatred or not, you don't need to ask me. What hatred does your relative have with you, why did you sell his bones?" Sister-in-law Hu stood there blankly for a while, then she smiled: "Sir, you are doing this for the sake of the Zhu family's child. This has nothing to do with me. He has his grandmother and mother to decide, selling him to someone to be a servant. If you were as rich as Master Jia, wouldn't I have acted as matchmaker for you long ago? Their family is waiting for a son-in-law to save them from poverty, but if he can't save them from poverty, he can't be their son-in-law. What's the need for politeness?" As she said this, she curled her lips twice. Bei Hai couldn't help but feel a flutter in his heart when he heard these words, and his body stood frozen and unable to move. Sister-in-law Hu sneered, turned sideways, and rushed past him. By the time Bei Hai came to his senses, she had run far away. Bei Hai was given the cold shoulder. He couldn't catch up to her, so he could only lower his head and quietly walk back into the house. Zhi Qian stared at him for a while, then said: "What did you say to that woman?" Bei Hai gave a wry smile and said: "There's nothing to say to such an ignorant woman. The only thing to do is to use the law to deal with her." As he said this, he clenched his fist and slammed it heavily on the edge of the table. Zhi Qian looked at him like this and knew that he had run into a wall. He smiled slightly: "Young people are always quick-tempered. Actually, there are many unfair things in society, and we can only look at some and ignore others." Bei Hai put his hands back in his pockets, spun around in the room a few times, then lowered his head and sat down on the chair, sighing softly. Zhi Qian looked at the partition wall of the next room, pursed his lips, and whispered with a smile: "You really shouldn't have interrupted their merriment. Let him bring another girl for us to see. Are there so many poor people here that they all have to sell themselves?" Bei Hai said: "There aren't many people who sell themselves, but there are too many human traffickers. In the universe, the parties involved don't care, but it's always the middlemen who ruin things." The louder he spoke, the more the veins on his neck stood out. (374)</p>

<p>When you tugged at my clothes and learned to speak,</p>
<p>You only clung to your mother's side all day long.</p>
<p>When you went out to school,</p>
<p>You only thought about finding a beautiful wife.</p>
<p>When you entered the bridal chamber,</p>
<p>You changed loved ones as soon as you got over it!</p>
<p>I worry about you, my sickly daughter,</p>
<p>I cherish you as my heart's treasure, my gold,</p>
<p>How much hardship I endured to raise you!</p>
<p>I remember when you were a child, you would respond to my every "mother".</p>
<p>Why now, after countless warnings, do you not heed my advice?</p>
<p>Sometimes, you roll your eyes and see your mother as a thorn in your side!</p>
<p>This attempts to combine the spirit and style of poetry, lyrics, and ballads into one, to make it easy to recite and sing, especially by heavily using existing colloquialisms, so that the public can be aware of it. This experimental work is intended to elicit sympathy from the contemporary audience. Perhaps there will be those who deride it as absurd, but I am prepared to accept their criticism! - Author's note.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<h3 id="e195">Discussions on Artistic Trades <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Lu</p>
<p>Our Eastern art has always been something that made Westerners speechless! Bamboo leaves and walnut boats have been passed down for a long time. I will not discuss those ancient skills, nor can I talk about so much. Now, I will just talk about the things I have seen personally, and that is enough to marvel at!</p>
<p>First, there is an ivory turning ring: On one side of a broad bean-sized ivory turning ring: A copy of the First Chibi Rhapsody was carved squarely and uprightly. Only black lines can be vaguely seen. Looking at it with a magnifying glass, it is a careful Su-style calligraphy, and the strokes are vivid and lifelike. On the other side: A picture of Su Dongpo's night tour of Chibi was carved. Although it can be seen that it is a landscape painting, under the magnifying glass, its levels and brushwork are indeed the painting method of the Three Wangs. The inscription is "Yu Xiaoxuan made in the capital." This Mr. Yu was still in Beiping in 1915 and 1916, so many people appreciated his art. Although there were several who could imitate him later, the details were slightly inferior, and the skill of the brushwork was inevitably different. This cannot be considered a superb skill?</p>
<p>Second, in 1919, at the banquet of Osi Ai Hadong, the owner of Shanghai's Ai Li Garden, I saw a silver cane: This silver cane was about two inches long, and the handle was inlaid with a yellow shell. According to the cracks of the shell, the natural demarcation, several lines of black characters were written on it. I don't remember the full text clearly; roughly: it describes a certain year in a certain province when a drought occurred, and Mr. Osi Ai Hadong generously donated a large sum of money to help the victims. The kindness of the righteous grain and benevolent soup saved countless lives. It expresses gratitude... etc. The inscription below is presented respectfully by the ×× Righteous Relief Association, and the calligraphy is also very accomplished. Compared to the carving of ivory by Yu Lanxuan, the writing is slightly larger, but it also needs to be identified with a magnifying glass, and Yu's carving is done with a knife, while it is written with a pen. What kind of pen can write such fine characters? And it is written on the rough shell! It is a pity that the person who wrote the characters did not leave his name.</p>
<p>Third, it is a fan pendant that I obtained in the inland: There are three stone seals of Tian Huangdong in the Beijing Ancient Artifacts Exhibition, which are made into three thin threads with the material itself and are connected together. Everyone was surprised to see it and thought it was the work of ghosts and gods. I personally obtained an ivory fan pendant in the inland of Anhui. It was a small gourd, like a white jade peanut. Some inscriptions and patterns were carved on the surface; after I bought it back, one day I wanted to wipe it clean, and I accidentally unscrewed the upper half of the gourd. I pulled out a thread that was more than three inches long from the gourd. It was even more strange! Four small trinkets were hanging on the thread: one was a honeycomb with several bees clinging to it, one was a flower basket with two peonies with complete branches and leaves inserted in it, one was a jue cup engraved with patterns of bells and tripods, and one was a small seal, which was also engraved with four square Zhuan script characters. Looking at it with a magnifying glass, it was the four characters "Liu Yin Ming Chuan". Only then did I understand the meaning of these objects, which was the implication of being granted the title of nobility and hanging the seal. Liu Mingchuan was from Anhui. He served as the Governor of Fujian and Taiwan during the late Qing Dynasty, and was granted the title of Baron for his military exploits. It was probably his subordinates who were currying favor with him. These small objects and a thread were all carved with the ivory itself. It was easy to pull them out, but it took a lot of effort to put them in. I don't know who's skill made this work of ghosts and gods? Unfortunately, I only had this item for a few years. Once, I encountered a very extraordinary change, and my life was almost lost. This item also disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="e196">A Kind of Big Business with Small Capital (Continued) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wosheng</p>
<p>If the labor of paper picking is changed to make crude bricks like bean cakes, then it can be done with half the effort. So I think this kind of division of labor and cooperation will definitely increase production. Other paper is afraid of being shelved and unable to be turned into money. If it is said to be pit paper, it is something that 400 million people use, and each sells to its own market. There is no fear that it will be shelved forever. Why should we hesitate not to do it.</p>
<p>(2) In any neighborhood, there must be many households. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are not uncommon to have one or two hundred households in a lane. If you register with the Utilizaiton Factory and take on the task of distribution, you only need to pay a deposit of fifty yuan to get seventy rolls to sell. This totals one thousand five hundred and forty Dao. Each Dao is sold for four and a half cents, and it can be sold for sixty-nine yuan and three cents. The payment only requires seventy cents per bundle, and there is still a five-yuan commission for every hundred yuan sold, which is in fact only a cost of forty-six yuan, five jiao and five cents, and you can get a profit of twenty-two yuan, seven jiao and nine cents. If you can turn it over twice a month, it is also considerable. In the beginning, we can also sacrifice a little, and send each household a roll with the words "Sold at this store" printed on the packaging paper. Once they try it, they will definitely feel that the product is good and cheap, no less than imported products, so they can sell it permanently, and there is no fear of others robbing it. This is very convenient, so why not do it?</p>
<p>The above method is a division of labor in manufacturing, a consumer cooperation in sales, and in fact a production and sales cooperation. I think it must be feasible, right?</p>
<p>(Note) The Utilization Factory can communicate directly with the Huishang Bridge in Wuxi</p>

<h3 id="e197">The Issue of Adopted Sons <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yu Yu</p>
<p>Recently, two news stories about mothers beating their children to death occurred in Shanghai: one was Jiang Wang beating her biological daughter to death, and the other was Wang Cao beating her adopted son to death.</p>
<p>The love between mother and child is innate. There are many unfilial children in the world, but no parents who do not love their children. From the birth of each child to their growth and establishment of a career, parents exhaust their minds and efforts to raise them. The so-called parents' love for their children is meticulous. However, Jiang Wang beat her daughter to death because she cried easily and urinated and defecated at will, deviating from common sense and severely scolding and beating her to death. This cruel method makes me suspect that the woman may be suffering from severe mental illness? Because we can no longer argue for her with a proper reason.</p>
<p>Wang Cao beat her adopted son to death. An adopted son is not one's own flesh and blood, and being beaten to death by her, the situation is not as simple as the above. In addition to Wang Cao's case being revealed by the newspapers, I am afraid that there are still some similar murder cases happening secretly around us. Therefore, we put aside legal issues and open our eyes to look at the family system under this feudal society.</p>
<p>When a new daughter-in-law is about to enter the door, if she has not given birth after three years, the husband will quarrel and plan to take a concubine, and the in-laws will use the analogy of chickens that lay eggs to satirize her. The nosy experts will also use this as conversation material to pass the time; on the one hand, this is due to the habit of valuing sons over daughters in this society, and on the other hand, it is secretly promoted by the issue of inheritance, because our family system is organized by sons and inheritance. Having an inheritance without a son is the biggest concern of parents. Within the scope of possibility, the most convenient way is to take a concubine, because the reason that there are three forms of unfilial conduct, of which the worst is to have no descendants, is convincingly. But what about widows who have lost their husbands? The nephews of uncles and brothers are immediately adopted as sons. On the surface, the flesh and blood of brothers are indistinguishable, but family disputes arise from here, and tragic cases of abuse of adopted sons, even to the point of being beaten to death, follow one after another.</p>
<p>Sons are good because they are one's own. Now, a child who is separated by a layer of belly is adopted as a son in name. It is already difficult to maintain the state of ordinary mother and child, let alone the many twists and turns (inheritance disputes caused by the adoption issue) that make this pair of false mother and child incompatible. Therefore, the adopted mother has her reasons, and the adopted son has his grievances. Both sides are secretly running in opposite directions, but on the surface, they have to maintain the attitude of mother and child. Wang Cao beat her adopted son to death. The news does not provide many details, and we cannot guess the twists and turns, but it is conceivable that the adopted mother and the adopted son are easily as incompatible as water and fire. Then, if it results in being beaten to death, or other means that lead to death, can we say that it is an accidental reason? Wang Cao's case is just one that has been revealed to us. What method can we use to rescue the many adopted mothers and sons who are still fighting in the dark?</p>
<h3 id="e198">Setting Out, How Difficult! <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>——One of the hardships of returning home through the snow</p>
<p>Days are not easy to pass when they are difficult, but they will not stop. The calendar is torn off one page after another, as if they do not care about their own process at all. Calculating it, it has been a full nine years.</p>
<p>For the death of my father, and for the oppression of being unable to endure hunger, I embarked on a vague future with tears in my eyes. I thought to myself, would this ease the burden of life? But when I thought of "prospects" and the reefs built inside, I was a little afraid, wasn't I? How would a sixteen-year-old child with two small furry fists wave in the iron-walled society?</p>
<p>I hardened my scalp and finally collided with the iron wall. Blood, sweat, and strength were covered by fatigue and soreness. One day, one month, one year, the torn calendars piled up under my feet. Unconsciously, I grew taller.</p>
<p>Autumn was driven away by a gust of cold north wind, and snow came, like goose feathers, covering the roofs and streets, estimating three or four inches. At this time, I lost my job.</p>
<p>——Where to go? Often, I am being questioned in my heart.</p>
<p>At that time, the situation was very urgent. The army filled the entire train and drove away. Panic hit everyone's heart. The nearby villages took the old and young and fled to the provincial capital, but the capitalists in the provincial capital fled to other provinces. What about the train? Don't think about it. It stopped running a long time ago. The air at the station was silent. Not to mention not having money, even if you have money, I'm afraid it's not easy to get out of that circle. Maybe it's "good luck," right? I thought</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>I didn't expect that at that critical moment, there would be a salt truck preparing to leave from here to Tianjin. After several negotiations, I was lucky enough to get permission. This was simply an unparalleled honor for me!</p>
<p>The next night, everything was packed up. Outside the window, the wind was blowing very hard. Suddenly, the door opened——</p>
<p>——Really annoying, the train can't stop in this city, you——He hesitated for a moment, and I thought it would be better to take the early train to Zhengzhou tomorrow and wait, there will be someone to greet you at the station. The escort person ran over and said to me.</p>
<p>The calmed mood became chaotic again. I always felt that it was too risky. If a child who had never been far away from home did not have anyone to greet him at Zhengzhou Station, if the car could not run again, then, the scene in front of him was dark, how would he cope? Thinking about it, the thoughts became particularly chaotic. Finally, let's fight with the remaining courage that was on the line!</p>
<p>The heads of people at the station were scrambling around. From the platform to a very long path, I found the freight car. Obeying the escort person's instructions, I sent the luggage onto the freight car. And, I met the person I had asked for help in advance. Ah, there should be no problem, right? I thought to myself like this.</p>
<p>——You don't have to talk too much, remember. Mr. Sun, who had been entrusted, warned me.</p>
<p>Counting it, there were only twenty people in the car, but there was a lot of luggage. The piercing cold wind blew in from the doorless hole, my teeth were grinding, and goosebumps rose all over my body.</p>
<p>In the front of the car, the throat was strained and howled, once, twice, knowing that it was time to start running.</p>
<p>——Hey, where are you from? Several soldiers surrounded me and asked. I didn't respond. Then, they questioned me even more urgently. It was really terrible. They asked me first, and there was no opportunity to even consider. It seemed impossible not to speak——</p>
<p>——Me? I am from ×××. I finally replied.</p>
<p>——Okay, get down, get down! Without explanation, I was pushed down and stood beside the rails. Mr. Sun told me to buy a ticket for third class, and he would be responsible for the luggage. See you again after Zhengzhou. When speaking, it seemed to blame me for being nosy.</p>
<p>The third-class car was full of people. I stood by the door of the toilet, my heart rising and falling uneasily, thinking about the luggage, thinking about my hometown, thinking about the prosperous commercial port, and also thinking about the ambush in the commercial port,... I was at a loss.</p>
<p>What time did the car actually leave? I didn't feel it at all.</p>

<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>At dusk, we were warming ourselves by the fire inside the house, burning a dry, withered twig we had picked up from the countryside. The flames flickered gently in the dark room, casting a red glow on everyone's faces.</p>
<p>There were no windows in the house, and it was surrounded by stacks of wooden crates that had carried foreign goods, and bulky local products, piled so densely that the house seemed to be fortified like a trench. The air could barely find any space to seep in, and the main door was tightly shut. The fire crackled as it burned the dry twigs, sometimes shooting out sparks like shooting stars. We all stared silently at the fire, without speaking. The quiet silence was unsettling. Yet no one dared to break it, and we just sat there blankly.</p>
<p>Snow was falling, like cotton, and we could still vaguely see people walking in the snow through the cracks in the door. Slowly, a dark figure blocked the small opening in the doorway, and we faintly heard heavy footsteps. Everyone's gaze immediately shifted from the fire to the door. We listened as the footsteps gradually approached, step by step.</p>
<p>A strangely monotonous knock made us aware of the terrifying journey in this snowy night.</p>
<p>The door opened, and unexpectedly it was not Old Ge, but the young, chubby Qin Fu, a partner from Longchang Mountain Goods Store. He secretly breathed a sigh of relief, thinking, "It would be terrible to have to rush on the road tonight! The snow is especially heavy today, and the mountain road will be difficult to travel at night." But in everyone's minds, no one dared to decide whether to endure the night road.</p>
<p>Old Man Zhu made room for Qin Fu to sit down. His body was covered in snowflakes, which immediately melted into water droplets upon touching the flames. So he shook himself a few times to let the water drip down, and then slowly sat down.</p>
<p>With one more person in the room, it didn't seem as deathly silent as before. Everyone's eyes were focused on Qin Fu, as if trying to find something to talk about. Old Man Zhu closed his eyes, thinking about something. After a moment, he suddenly let out a long sigh, looked at Qin Fu, and then opened his dry mouth to say:</p>
<p>"Qin Fu, your store doesn't have to rush at night in snowy weather, right? I heard from Old Ming that there's no need to rush mountain goods at night in winter... Your boss is really good, not making things difficult for his partners in snowy weather. We can't do that, we rush day and night. I don't know what tonight will be like? I'm too useless, still without any success after being a porter for decades. It's really dangerous to walk in snowy weather. If my blood weakens for a moment and I fail, then it's over! It's not good to live well, but I should at least die well. I really don't want to die in the mountains and become a mountain god... Alas, it's hard to say, I've seen these things with my own eyes, Uncle Lin Er died like that... It's really scary to talk about..." He paused and then fell silent again.</p>
<p>Qin Fu lowered his head, watching the flames flicker, and poked at the twigs with his hand, as if wanting to raise his head to answer Old Man Zhu, but he only glanced at him vaguely and then lowered his head again without saying a word.</p>
<p>Everyone continued to sit quietly. Song Sen stretched out his hands, yawned, and stretched, looking a bit tired. Old Man Zhu closed and opened his eyes from time to time, looking at our expressions, and then lowered his head in thought.</p>
<p>The night gradually passed, and the snow seemed to be getting heavier. The footsteps outside the door became sparse.</p>
<p>The flames of the dry twigs were not as strong as before, and our toes felt a bit cold, stiff, itchy, and painful. Song Sen couldn't bear the silent suffering and wanted to sleep. So Qin Fu decided to go back.</p>
<p>I opened the door for Qin Fu, and he flashed his flashlight at the street. The snow had thickly covered the ground. He took a few steps and suddenly cried out "Ah!" and turned back, calling my name, "Old Cen!"</p>
<p>Thinking something had happened to him, I grabbed Old Man Zhu's hand, felt for a gun by my side, and ran out.</p>
<p>Qin Fu shined the flashlight on the snow. It was a corpse, already tightly pressed down by the snow, and the person was no longer breathing. Old Man Zhu shook his graying head and sighed, "Alas, still a hard life—"</p>

<p>Yi Hua Film Company's latest and most valuable production, a problem drama dissecting the causes of the decline of industry and commerce, a full dialogue sound singing feature film "Hero of the Hour," will be released soon at the Jincheng Grand Theater. Regarding this film, with director Ying Yunwei holding great confidence first, and the supporting audience placing sincere attention behind, there is no doubt that it will resonate throughout Shanghai. Moreover, the film not only has a profound and sharp dissection of the rise and fall of Chinese industry and commerce over the past fifty years, but also a clear introduction and systematic narration of the large number of foreigners coming to China over the past fifty years, their active investment in various businesses in China, the impact and waves this has caused on Chinese society, and the economic and cultural invasion and changes it has undergone. Because the director is quite adept at using film techniques, it is filled with a tense, enthusiastic, and stimulating atmosphere from beginning to end, able to tightly grasp the psychology of every audience member, causing the audience's excited emotions to rise and even explode in uncontrollable feelings as the plot unfolds. In particular, the conditions of Shanghai streets and the clothing customs of Shanghai men and women from all walks of life forty to fifty years ago are all shown in this film, so it can also give the audience a sense of recollection, like tasting a remonstrative fruit with endless aftertaste, revealing a knowing smile in the midst of the tense atmosphere.</p>

<p>No matter which aspect you look at it from, the success of "Human Relations" has indeed won great glory for the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>In terms of plot, this unfolds the story of four generations of a family, explaining the true meaning of familialism through extremely complex human relationships. Chinese people have always been rich in family ideology. Due to the deep-rooted nature of this ideology, they gradually fall into narrowness, only knowing about the family and forgetting that there is a larger society existing outside the family. Society, and even the country, is dominated by this narrow family ideology, thus experiencing a great impact. "Human Relations" grasps this theme and seriously explains that everyone must extend their love for the family to all of humanity. In "Life," playwright Zhong Shigen once shouted the slogan of saving children. In "Human Relations," he raises this righteous cry again.</p>
<p>In terms of direction, the most noteworthy thing is that every shot has a new and innovative creation. In any small segment, one can see that the director has put in extremely hard work. The arrangement of characters, the creation of atmosphere, and the use of shots are all original—which will amaze you, amaze you that such an amazing work can be produced under China's backward mechanical technology.</p>
<p>Speaking of actors: this is enough to be proud of everything. It brings together the elite of Lianhua's stars, creating the only miracle after "The Big Road." Everyone has achieved balanced development, and all contribute their most skilled acting skills. Watching such a film, just in terms of its actors, is enough to satisfy people.</p>
<p>Of course, photography, scenery... and everything else has amazing achievements.</p>
<p>This is the glory of the Chinese film industry.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Exploration of Ancient Bath Garden Architecture (Below) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>—One of Rome's National Architectural Art Masterpieces—</p>
<p>Roman bath garden architecture is divided into two types: 1. Small bath gardens, 2. Large bath gardens. The former was built from the Republic era, called Balnae, imitating the Greek system, with a capacity of hundreds of people; in the city of Rome, there were no less than six hundred of these small bath gardens, but most were private, so they can also be called "private bath gardens." The latter was built from the Empire era, called Thernae, with a capacity of thousands of people, with about one hundred in the entire city. Because they are public in nature and funded by the state, they can also be called "public bath gardens." In the history of world architectural art, the former has little influence, and the latter has great influence. Therefore, when architectural researchers speak of Roman bath gardens, they mostly refer to public large bath gardens. Here, we can see that the appearance of this type of architecture at that time really gave people a good impression, just like the appearance of temple architecture in the Greek era! Deeply imprinted in our minds, giving us an understanding of how ingenious, precious, and great the ancient architectural art was...</p>
<p>The Roman bath garden was founded by Scipia Apricanus, the marshal of the Punic War, but the work was not perfect. Until Rome became a country, the bath garden was only for preparation. Until the imperial era, it changed the old view of the past, adding extravagance and seeking pleasure at will. Therefore, the function of the bath garden also changed from the purpose of hygiene to a place of extravagant pleasure-seeking; this is the general history of Roman bath garden architecture.</p>
<p>Roman public bath gardens are also like modern clubs, because their purpose is not only for people to bathe, but also for people to use for recreation. Therefore, in addition to a part of the bath pool building, there are also parks, sports grounds, theaters, rest rooms, libraries, and various markets, all built in. As for the form of the bath pool, it is not uniform, with square, rectangular, round, and elliptical shapes. The buildings along the coast of the bath pool have huge rooms, which are dressing rooms for changing clothes after bathing. Outside the dressing room, there is a colored column cloister, circulating throughout the garden. In addition to hot and cold water, the bath pool water also has perfume for women, and the bath pool in the palace also has milk. In the movie "Spring Colors of the Roman Palace," it is said that "the emperor and queen bathed together in hundreds of buckets of milk." From this, we can know that the pride, luxury, and licentiousness of Rome at that time can be used as a powerful and ironclad proof.</p>
<p>The materials for Roman bath garden architecture are mostly valuable. The inlay work in the garden is made of various colored pearls and jades, shining brightly. The bath pools are made of gold, silver, jade, and crystal clear white stone. The attached sculptures, paintings, flowers, and figures are lifelike. The columns and colonnades of the cloister are decorated with gorgeous colors, adding a layer of magic to this magnificent bath garden! Making visitors feel dazzled and fascinated, with a strange idea of entering a dreamlike state!</p>
<p>The Roman people's love of bathing is really like the lower-class people's love of drinking tea in China now. Romans entering the bath garden is equal to Chinese people going to the teahouse. And the bath pool water is cold and hot, so some people have tasted only the hot pond, and Wen Jingliang Pond is said to be good, enjoying it endlessly, and some have entered the garden since childhood, from batches to old age, happily forgetting to return. In addition, various domestic and foreign news are gathered in the dressing room in the surrounding area, forming friendships daily, listening to new sayings from time to time, directly like a fair exhibition. Because of this, the magic of the bath garden is becoming greater day by day. As for the greatest representative work of the bath garden, it is the Emperor Caracalla, which has been destroyed, but later generations see its ruins like a city site of more than ten miles, and the greatness of its project can be imagined! Commentators say that the Roman bath garden is enough to represent the peak of Rome and also enough to invite the downfall of Rome; although there are many reasons for the downfall, the bath garden is also one of them. Since the Germanic forest barbarians came out, Rome also announced its demise; once Rome was destroyed, the large living room in the bath garden was changed into a Christian church. The gold and stone treasures in the garden are also in the museums of various European countries. The large stones of the bath garden were changed into coffins for certain Christians. Because bath garden architecture was a representative of the national architectural glory in the era of its full power; and at the time of the overthrow of the clan society, it was also enough to show the warning of sin. From this, we can know that buildings can not only represent the rise and fall of a country, but also influence the rise and fall of a country!</p>
<p>When did China's bath garden begin? It is really impossible to verify. But we know that it already existed in the Tang Dynasty. And great masterpieces have appeared one after another. The most famous of these is the "Huaqing Pool" built on Mount Lishan, south of Lin'an County, Shaanxi. The pool contains hot springs. When Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty first built it, it was called Yiquan Palace. Emperor Xuanzong changed it to Huaqing Palace, and the pool was also named Huaqing Pool.殿臺 were arranged around the pool, and hundreds of departments and public officials' residences were also set up. The magnificence of the building can also be imagined! Moreover, there is also a fragrant and romantic story in it!</p>
<p>China's bath gardens, just like Roman bath gardens, are mostly built inside palaces, exclusively for the enjoyment of emperors and queens. From the "Tang Hui Yao," we can see the following record:</p>
<p>"...Dezong said to Pei Yanling that the bath hall palace where he lived would crush it if it was not easily changed..."</p>
<p>Also, from "Bai Juyi's Poems," we can find two sentences:</p>
<p>"Accustomed to seeing greenhouse trees, well-versed in bath hall flowers"</p>
<p>From the above two paragraphs, we can know how prevalent bath gardens were in palaces at that time. Unfortunately, there is no special book to record its architectural details, and we have no way to explore it.</p>
<p>As for what the folk architecture of our country's bath gardens was like? Then we can know some general information from the record in the book "Yangzhou Painted Boat Record": To make the end of this article!</p>
<p>"The wind of the bath pool was opened in Guo Tang of Shaobo Town, and later Zhang Tang outside Xuning Gate imitated it, and used white stone as the pool, more than ten feet square, with several large and small grids, the larger one near the pot, the water is hot as a large pool, and the smaller one with not very hot water is a baby pool."

<p>The Municipal Hospital, designed by architect Dong Dayou and built by Lugenji Construction Company, has been completed in full. The house was ground breaking by Mayor Wu on New Year's Day this year. The work lasted for more than ten months. All building materials are top-notch goods. The use of block flooring in the hospital is especially suitable. It is said that it was undertaken by the local Meihe Foreign Company. The total cost is about 440,000 yuan. Because Lugenji, the contractor of the house, was also in charge of building the National Music Conservatory next to the Shibanjian Bridge on Guofu Road in Nanjing, Mr. Lu Genquan, the owner of the factory, is currently signing the contract in Beijing and will return to Shanghai this Friday to actively decorate the interior of the house so that it can be completed and opened as soon as possible to benefit the citizens.</p>

<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>—About the Use in Construction Sites—</p>
<p>Lu Fei——What is Lu Fei? It is the thing made of Mao Chai tubes that ordinary people call Lu Xi. In the construction site, the use of Lu Fei used to depend almost entirely on it. Now, because the engineering management authorities (referring to the concession) have seen that Lu Fei is easy to catch fire. Except for those that cannot be avoided and must be used. It is generally prohibited. However, when building houses in the inland, those small-capital bosses often still use Lu Fei to build the facade and wall of the tent room and material room (detailed earlier) in order to save expenses.</p>
<p>Oil Taa——The meaning of Oil Taa. It is another name for oil paper made by soaking mulberry paper in tung oil. It is used to sandwich in the inner layer of Lu Fei. (One sheet of oil Taa is sandwiched between two sheets of Lu Fei) in order to prevent rain water from being soaked when covering the roof.</p>
<p>Han Zi——A thing made of bamboo pieces sharpened into a sharp point at both ends. The thing shaped like an arrow is called Han Zi. It is used to flatten Lu Fei. (What is called not Lu Fei. It is to cover the roof or wall. Han Zi is used to make it flat).</p>
<p>Bamboo Strips——Using bamboo heads to build scaffolding. There are also many names such as Chong Tian, ​​Qi Kang, Ding Cheng, and Heng Leng. But its method is not like wooden scaffolding with several lead wires wrapped tightly. It is to tie each place firmly with bamboo strips. Bamboo strips are thin strips seven or eight feet long made of bamboo cyan (that is, the cyan side. The other side is called bamboo yellow.). It must be immersed in water when used. Because the nature of bamboo strips is too dry, it is not easy to tie the joints of the scaffolding firmly. The remedy. Just soak it in water before. It is more convenient to tie it up.

<h3 id="e212">Family Bonds <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Da Kang</p>
<p>The Glory of Chinese Cinema</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, China has only produced one such "Family Bonds," a uniquely bold work. It is fully deserving of the solemn title of "Cinematic Art."</p>
<p>No one in the domestic film industry has ever dared to attempt a script with such a broad scope, encompassing stories spanning seventy or eighty years, from the first generation to the fourth, from family love to human love. Although its name is "Family Bonds," it is not limited to narrow familialism but advocates breaking away from familialism and extending this love to all of humanity.</p>
<p>Stringing together the stories of four generations under one roof, it depicts the vicissitudes of a family and embodies the so-called "human love"—the greatest and purest love in the universe. This is the essence of "Family Bonds."</p>
<p>"Family Bonds" is written by the renowned playwright Zhong Shigen. His previous works, such as "Humanity," "City Nights," and "Life," were all masterpieces. In this play, he continues to use complex structures to express his lofty ideals. From this, one can glimpse his spirit of speaking out for humanity and the masses.</p>
<p>Directing such a complex play is exceptionally difficult, but the director of this film was able to handle it with ease, using his special techniques and a very solemn tone to organize this intricate play in a methodical manner. In every shot and every scene, you can find new and special creations. Sometimes, even in very ordinary scenes, his techniques can touch the depths of the human soul.</p>
<p>For the actors, the most outstanding talents of Lianhua were selected. Each of them gave their best performance. Lianhua used ninety percent of all its actors to fully produce this film.</p>
<p>"Family Bonds" is undoubtedly worthy of being recorded as a glorious achievement in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Aesthetic "Family Bonds" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Wanderer</p>
<p>With China's top-tier director, taking over a year, spending nearly 100,000 yuan, and gathering the energy of Lianhua's twelve major stars to write about the historical process of Chinese society's evolution in the forty years before and after the revolution, this alone is enough to stand out in the film industry and look down on everything else.</p>
<p>What's more...</p>
<p>The correctness of the "Family Bonds" consciousness is not only unprecedented in the film industry but also, in a social sense, starts from the love of parents and children and aims for the love of humanity. This kind of ethical view is truly an eternal truth, and its greatness is far beyond the reach of ordinary, impromptu writers.</p>
<p>In terms of scenery, the architecture is magnificent, and the furnishings are luxurious and splendid. The beauty of embellishing the screen is self-evident, and its contribution to promoting China's inherent art cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The selection of outdoor scenes is ingenious. The misty rain of Jiangnan is already intoxicating. The scenery of water and mountains stretches for thousands of miles. After watching it, one's feelings are refreshed.</p>
<p>The consistency of the actors' performances is also a feature of this film. It is purely won by depth and is extremely touching, giving viewers the impression that they cannot avoid it. There is probably no one who can watch it without shedding tears.</p>
<p>In short, "Family Bonds" is not only an unprecedented miracle in the history of Chinese cinema, but the world film industry will also be shocked by it.</p>

<p>Lin Chuchu</p>
<p>The kind mother on the screen, the comforter of countless orphans, has an unprecedented performance in "Family Bonds." All of her past achievements have been satisfactory, but in "Family Bonds," she takes it to the next level. Especially when announcing that their grandson has embezzled public funds, her expression can be said to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan</p>
<p>The innocent little bird, the genius of tragedy, who is unanimously loved by movie audiences, is a willful child here, and also the only character who suffers a tragic outcome. The more tragic the atmosphere, the more Yanyan's talent can be seen. This character, who needs no introduction, will touch your heart with every move here—especially after her disappointment.</p>
<p>Shang Guanwu</p>
<p>His outstanding talent, meticulous spirit, and careful and keen thinking are all perfectly suited to the character and status of the great old man in "Family Bonds."</p>
<p>Li Zhuozhuo</p>
<p>The passionate girl here plays a shrew, a typical shrew, disrespectful to her parents-in-law, inciting her husband, vain, and concerned about face. All the conditions of a shrew are all available here.</p>
<p>Zhang Ji</p>
<p>Zhang Yi's character as a femme fatale is reproduced here; he can be good or evil. He cannot resolve the battle between heaven and man, the conflict between father and wife. He almost became a lost lamb forever.</p>
<p>Hong Jingling</p>
<p>Sharp and cunning are his specialties. He portrays the act of currying favor with the powerful and acting like flies buzzing around carrion vividly.</p>
<p>Li Keng</p>
<p>The innocent and pure little angel. When he "plays the flute without a tune, blowing whatever comes to mind," he is very cute and respectable when he clings to his grandfather's lap.</p>
<p>Gu Menghu</p>
<p>A playboy and unfaithful rake.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua</p>
<p>A rising star who shows off his talent, the smile of victory on his face makes Yanyan's frustration even more apparent.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli</p>
<p>A man with both academic knowledge and experience, who always "draws from all sides." Here, he takes on the important work of the second half.</p>
<p>Mei Lin</p>
<p>A beautiful and delicate little girl, who became a daughter-in-law who bowed her head and endured insults, with a taste of chastity and tranquility.</p>
<p>It is rare for a film to have so many brilliant stars, and they are all veteran warriors who have been through countless battles. This alone shows its greatness and beauty.</p>
<p>Speaking of the art of directing, "Family Bonds" can be rightly called the only creative masterpiece in the history of Chinese cinema, and we believe that this film will definitely win unparalleled glory for our film industry.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Recommendation <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— News</p>
<p>We would like to strongly recommend this Lianhua treasured short film "Family Bonds" to all the ladies of Shanghai!</p>
<p>This is what we deeply know: Lianhua spent three years preparing for the completion of this film, one year in production, a significant amount of money and brainpower, and almost all of Lianhua's energy was focused on this film.</p>
<p>When the script for this film was sent to the central government for registration, it received great praise from the central government, which asked them to "produce it properly." Upon completion, many film publications across the country gave excellent preliminary reviews. From this, we can imagine the value of this film.</p>
<p>Under the intense anticipation of the whole country, it is scheduled to premiere tomorrow, and the theater where it will be shown is the most luxurious and elegant Grand Theatre in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The first screening rights of "Family Bonds" have been obtained by the Grand Theatre. The Grand Theatre has never shown a Chinese film since its opening, because its audience is mostly Westerners. Now, the theater is introducing this film to a wide audience of Westerners, giving them the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of Chinese cinematic art. This is meaningful.</p>
<p>The fact that "Family Bonds" can be shown at the Grand Theatre and will be promoted to the world at the same time is the most gratifying thing in the history of Chinese cinema, and it can also be said that the film has achieved victory after hard work!</p>
<h3 id="e216">My Thoughts on "Family Bonds," Opening Next Week at the Grand Theatre <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Long</p>
<p>"Heaven is the norm, earth is the righteousness, and the people are the actions."</p>
<p>This is indeed a rare work in the Chinese film industry!</p>
<p>From the perspective of plot and theme: It depicts the deeds of four generations—great-grandparents, grandparents, parents, and children—in a family over several decades. However, these decades were precisely when Eastern and Western cultures were in rapid contact, and social attitudes and standards changed several times. The psychology and behavior of Chinese society during these decades also had various different forms. In particular, shortly after the initial contact between Eastern and Western cultures, old social attitudes and standards were about to be destroyed, and new social attitudes and standards were not only not yet established but were still in a state of confusion where everyone insisted on their own views. At this time, people wanted to escape the old shackles, but after escaping the old shackles, "where to go?" Since the question of "where to go" could not be resolved, people naturally fell into confusion, or went astray. Calmly speaking, I am afraid that more people went astray than hesitated in those years!</p>
<p>What "Family Bonds" indicates to those who have gone astray is: Come back, lost sheep! However, what is indicated to the lost sheep here is not the old road they came from, but a right path in front of the old road, which is to say: Dedicate yourself to the broad masses.</p>
<p>From the name of this play, it is clear that the theme must be to teach "filial piety." That's right, not wrong at all, teach filial piety, but this is not teaching people to learn "cutting one's arm to cure a parent" or "worshipping mountains and praying to Buddha for a parent's longevity," but rather teaching people to be "inhumanly" filial. Instead, it teaches people to be filial in a natural, human way.</p>
<p>"The beginning of human love is based on a kind of infant love, that is, the natural love between parents and children. The universe is eternal, and this love is also eternal."</p>
<p>Here, "filial piety" is not explained as an absolute duty of children to their parents. In particular, it is not explained as a private thing in a parent-child relationship (note: relationship). It is explained as a common emotion between humans, which is a part of the broad human love that occurred earlier due to convenience.</p>
<p>Because of the difference in explanations, there are significant differences in the ways of practicing filial piety.</p>
<p>Explaining filial piety as a private possession of the parent-child relationship and as an absolute duty of children to their parents means that, first, parents may not be kind, but children cannot be unfilial; second, as long as so-called "filial piety" is practiced, the means used do not matter. A robber may kill and loot, but he can gain the name of a filial son for providing delicious food to please his parents.</p>
<p>It is not like this here!</p>
<p>It says that "filial piety" (actually love) is a common emotion among humans and is the foundation for promoting broad human love. Therefore, the principle of parental love and filial piety arises in the family. Externally, it is "respect the elders of others as you respect your own, and care for the children of others as you care for your own." Loving others is being filial to one's parents. Harming others to be filial to one's parents is not only not considered filial but also considered rebellious.</p>
<p>This ethical view can be said to be "unchanging for a hundred generations and applicable to all seas."</p>
<p>From a technical point of view: With a straightforward story, it arranges decades of time and dozens of actors. It is a more difficult task to manage in terms of systematic organization, and the director has skillfully handled this time and these characters. In theory, he adopted the viewpoint of neo-symbolism, enthusiastically using some materials that seem to have little to do with the topic but are actually the most powerful. Not only does it add some help to the writing of the story, whether explicitly or implicitly, I am afraid that it is also a brand new type in the field of Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, what "Family Bonds" shows to people is "human love," and the director grasped this point. Originally, this so-called human nature is a virtue unique to human beings. Readers should not misunderstand that the author has some idealistic color. No, the so-called human love is not something that falls into the realm of human consciousness out of thin air, but the result of years of human cultural accumulation, the sublimation of primitive love.</p>
<p>The director deliberately described this central consciousness, and the great and painful scenes attracted the viewers so much that they almost felt as if they were in it and were deeply moved. Although there are inevitably some preachy elements, it is gratifying that, like Bai Juyi's poems, even if it is preaching, it does not feel dry and dull at all.</p>
<p>In particular, the greatness and beauty of the pictures give viewers great appeal, and for its greatness and beauty, I would rather abandon the magnificent architecture and take its poetic natural scenery. Even if it is just water, clouds, birds, and trees, without having to savor the deep meaning it contains, just evaluating it from an aesthetic point of view, its beauty is by no means something that ordinary hands can use. As for the vast mountains and forests, the white lambs freely jumping and gnawing, the setting sun reflecting its afterglow from the horizon, and the shepherd climbing high and calling out, it will make you inevitably think of the sentence "The sun is setting"!</p>
